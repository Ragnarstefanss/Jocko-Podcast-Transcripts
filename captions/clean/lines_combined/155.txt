00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50 This is Jocopot Gas No. 155 with me, Jocco-Willink.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000 On the island, the dead were piling up.
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000 In the mission report, the head of the convoy wrote,
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000 at 2 p.m. on May 20th, I went to the island of Nizino with Commander Tepskov.
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000 There was a terrible scramble, people crowding and fighting around the bags of flower.
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000 Dead bodies everywhere, a hundred or more, and lots of people crawling about and crying,
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000 give us bread, boss, it's been two days since we've been given anything to eat.
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000 They're trying to make us die of hunger and the cold.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000 They told us that people had begun eating the dead bodies,
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000 that they were cooking human flesh.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000 The scene on the island was dreadful, appalling.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000 On May 21st alone, the three health officers counted 70 additional dead bodies.
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000 In five cases, they emphasized the liver, the heart, the lungs,
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000 and fleshy part of bodies had been cut off.
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000 On one of the bodies, the head had been torn off along with the male genital organs and part of the skin.
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000 These mutilations constitute strong evidence of cannibalistic acts.
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000 In addition, they suggest the existence of serious psychopathologies.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000 On the same day, May 21st, the deportees themselves brought us three individuals who had been caught
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000 with blood on their hands and holding human livers.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000 Our examination of these three individuals did not reveal any extreme amaciation.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000 And there's an elderly local peasant woman who reported the things we saw.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000 People were dying everywhere. They were killing each other.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000 There was a guard named Kostia Venikov, a young fellow.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000 He was courting a pretty girl who had been sent there. He protected her.
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000 One day, he had to be away for a while.
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000 And he told one of his comrades, take care of her.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000 But with all the people, the comrades couldn't do much.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000 People caught the girl, tied her to a tree, caught off her breasts, her muscles, everything they could eat.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000 They were hungry. They had to eat. When Kostia came back, she was still alive.
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000 He tried to save her, but she had lost too much blood.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000 She died. That was the kind of thing that happened.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000 When you went along the island, you saw flesh wrapped in rags.
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:55.000 Human flesh that had been cut and hung in the trees.
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000 And that right there is from a book called Cannibal Island by Nicholas W.
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000 Who's written books about communism.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000 I think is most famous is the black book of communism.
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.000 Cannibal Island specifically breaks down one of the small individual nightmares of the Soviet Gulags.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000 But the nightmare was not small.
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000 And it certainly was not specific. It was widespread and it was broad.
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000 And it was almost incomprehensible.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000 And very little about it would be known or not for one man.
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Alexander, Solchonetsen, who not only survived the Gulags,
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000 but lived on to write incredibly detailed and very well-researched books about the Gulags.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000 Some of them were fictionalized like a day in the life of Ivan, Denisovic,
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000 and for the good of the cause.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000 But most comprehensively in his three volume-tone, the Gulag, Arkepelegov.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000 And this series is a massive series.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000 And it's been cut down to an abridged version that was actually approved by the author himself.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000 And the abridged version has just been re-released in Europe,
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000 where they forwarded by a man that I think repopularized that book.
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000 A man that is here today to discuss that book and among other things.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000 I'm sure a man that I needed to give an introduction to the first time he was on this podcast.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000 But now who needs no introduction whatsoever.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000 A man by the name of Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000 Jordan, thank you for coming back on.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000 How is it rough beginning, Jockel?
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000 Jesus.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000 Yeah.
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000 I remember when I started listening to you would say something along the lines of that,
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000 you know, we are quite capable of creating hell for ourselves as human beings.
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000 And that clearly, that situation, I don't know.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000 I mean, that's hell.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000 Yeah.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000 And close enough.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000 Yeah.
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000 And it's created by us, which I think is obviously horrific.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000 And the Gulag archipelago, you know, you talked about that book a lot.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000 And one of the things that, on that book, it's you hard, obviously.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000 For me, there's a book called About Face by Colonel David Hackworth.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000 I'm from a different world, I guess, that you in many ways.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000 The book that hit me hardest in my life was that book about face.
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000 And it's, it's one of those things that when I read it, I started putting it together
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000 It's like things started to fit.
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000 And I remember that.
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000 And I was wondering, I guess from my perspective, at what point did you read the Gulag archipelago?
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000 And at what point did you start to say, okay, there's something really, really important here
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000 for me to try and understand?
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000 Well, I read it back in the 1980s, early.
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000 I would say, I'd read some social nits and before that.
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000 I read the day in the life of Ivan Nissovich when I was about 13 or 14.
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000 And then I read the Gulag archipelago in my early 20s when I was reading a lot of psychological material too
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000 when I started reading Yung and Freud and the Great clinicians.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000 And I was reading a fair bit about what had happened and Nazi Germany at the same time
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000 and also Victor Frankl's man's search for meaning.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000 And the Solgenytsons book is, in some ways, like an elaborated extension of Frankl.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000 Frankl, of course, described what happened to him in the Nazi concentration camps.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000 And so relatively short book and it's a great book.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000 But the Solgenytsons book is, it's much broader and I would say, deeper.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000 And the thing that affected me most particularly was the psychological take on the totalitarian states.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000 You know, I had been studying political science up to that point.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000 And the political science, scientists and the economists, who I would say were under the sway of Marxist thinking,
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000 although not nearly to the degree that they are now,
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000 were convinced that the reason that people engaged in conflict was basically a consequence of argumentation over resources.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000 You know, it was basically an economic argument.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000 And I never bought that.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000 It never made sense to me.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000 Obviously there are circumstances where that's true, but it didn't seem to be fundamentally the case.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000 Like tribal warfare isn't precisely about resources.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000 It's maybe it's about territory or maybe it's about identity, but it never seemed to me to be simply about resources.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000 Partly because, well, a resource is something that people value,
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000 but it isn't obvious why people value what they value.
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000 And so it doesn't solve the fundamental problem.
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000 Anyways, when I was reading Frankl and Solgenytsons,
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000 I started to more deeply understand the relationship between the individual and the atrocity.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000 And that's what I found most interesting was that Frankl's claim and Solgenytsons claim as well,
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000 that it was the moral corruption of the citizenry that allowed the totalitarian catastrophes to occur.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000 And that in some sense was the responsibility of every individual in the system who looked the other way or who participated actively.
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000 I mean, even in the Gulag camps themselves, they were almost all run by the prisoners.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000 There wasn't enough administrative manpower to run the prison system without the cooperation.
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000 So to speak of the prisoners.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000 So it is a surreal sort of hell where you imprison yourself and Solgenytsons fundamental claim.
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000 And this was true for Frankl as well and also for Vaclav Havel,
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000 who eventually became president of Czechoslovakia, or at least to the Czech Republic.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000 I don't remember which.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000 You know, they believed that it was the individual proclivity to accept lies that fostered the ability of Thai people.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000 The ability of tyrants to destroy the state.
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:06.000 And then, well, and that also led to complicitness with regards to all the absolute atrocities that we're occurring in both the Nazi state and the Soviet state.
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000 And I think that's true.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000 When I read, like I read Solgenytsons books and a lot of the books I read about Nazi Germany too, not as a victim,
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000 and not as a hero, but as a perpetrator.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000 And I know which I think it's really important. It's something that's really important to do when you read history.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000 Is that it's easy to cast yourself as a victim.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000 It's easy to cast yourself as the person who would have been heroic in the circumstance,
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000 but it's also unbelievably useful to understand that there's a good chance had you been in those situations
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000 that you wouldn't have been on the side of the good guys.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000 And that's a terrible, it's really a terrible realization,
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000 it's necessary, realization.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000 Again, just going back to this idea of what you get out of reading,
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000 because people ask me to ask me to, because I read books all the time on my podcast,
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000 and what you just said, it struck me as something that's...
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000 People have told me, I read that book before,
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000 but I didn't really get out of it, what you got out of it,
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000 and when I heard you read it, I was saying,
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000 how did I... I need to go reread this book.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000 And I think one of the key things is you looked at these books as you were not the victim,
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000 but the perpetrator, one thing that when I read books, I read a lot of books,
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000 mostly about war.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000 For me, I always think about the people,
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000 I don't always see myself as the person that goes in heroically,
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000 storms the beaches and survives.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000 In a war book, there's these people that get mentioned for a half a paragraph for two sentences,
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000 and sometimes they don't even have a name,
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000 because you're the battalion commander storm in the beach of Normandy.
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000 You're not going to name every single person,
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000 but for some reason, and maybe it's just my experiences of being in combat,
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000 when I read about that two sentences of that guy,
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000 that gets shot, that gets killed, that gets blown up,
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000 that's what I think.
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000 I completely understand and relate to that person.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000 I don't just see it as me being the guy that is always winning,
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000 and always doing okay, and always surviving.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000 I feel and relate to those guys that didn't,
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000 and part of that is just because of my friends that I lost in combat.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000 Like those guys, they're people,
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000 and I think that key thing of reading it and going,
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000 man, every single person, like when you read about these,
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000 you're talking about millions of people that were tortured, died, murdered,
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000 every one of those people, key word as people,
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000 every one of those people is a person,
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000 and to your point, every single one of those executioners,
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000 every single one of those murders, is also a person.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000 There's a great book called, ordinary man.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000 Oh yeah, we reviewed that on this podcast.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000 Right, and so it's one of the greatest books written about what happened
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000 in the Second World War, I think, on the end of the atrocity end,
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000 because the author does such a lovely job of,
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000 well, it's a strange way of putting it in this context,
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000 but it's about this police battalion that was moved into Poland
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000 after the Germans went through and occupied the country,
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000 to establish order like police do, but also to participate
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000 in the mopping up, let's say, that was part and parcel of the war,
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000 and these were ordinary policemen, middle class guys,
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000 most of whom had been educated and socialized before the Nazi propaganda
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000 machine really got rolling, so they weren't like Hitler, youth types.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000 They were ordinary men, and they were brought,
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000 and they had a commander who had made an explicit case
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000 that if they weren't able to tolerate the conditions in Poland
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000 that they could go home, so there was no top down order that you had to do this
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000 or else, and then they were, you know, first of all,
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000 they started rounding up, well, mostly Jewish people men between 18 and 65,
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000 and then, you know, they started to participate in the entire atrocious mess,
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000 and they were, they ended up many of them taking naked pregnant women out
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000 into fields and shooting them in the back of the head,
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000 and what the author does is outline how that happens to you,
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000 you know, one step at a time, and so it's a really horrifying book,
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000 and it's a brilliant book, because there's no attempt to make
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000 the perpetrators like some creatures that aren't human,
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000 like just pure psychopaths, and of course, in a situation like Nazi Germany,
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000 and in the horrors of the communist states,
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000 there was no shortage of places for psychopaths to prevail,
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000 but that's not really the issue. The issue is, well,
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000 how does an ordinary person come to participate in a global horror,
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000 let's say, and what does that mean about being an ordinary person?
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000 And then the next question is, well, what does it mean about how you should
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000 conduct your life, and one of the things that, I mean,
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000 I think what happened to me when I read all this material in the 80s
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000 was that I became convinced that there wasn't anything more important to do
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000 in the aftermath of what had happened in the 20th century,
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000 than to try to build people who were responsible enough
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000 as truth-telling courageous, responsible citizens,
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000 so that the probability would increase that if they were in a position
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000 to make a terrible choice that they would make the right one,
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000 and I would say this lecture tour that I'm doing, which is now extended over
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000 more than 100 cities, is an extension of the same thing.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000 Well, I think it's the same thing that you're trying to do with your book.
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000 We were just looking at your Mikey and the Dragon's book,
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000 and you're trying to lay out a psychological pathway
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000 that guides people towards responsibility and courage and truth,
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000 and all of that, and that is the bulwark against tyranny,
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000 actually at the individual level, and we kind of know that in the West.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000 I think that's part of the core ethos of certainly of the English common law
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000 system, certainly of the American way of looking at the world,
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000 is that each citizen is the bulwark against tyranny,
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000 and that's actually true.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000 And that's a terrible thing to think through,
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000 because it means that you are responsible for the integrity
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000 or lack thereof of your state, and it's on you.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000 And there's something great about that, because it means that your existence
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000 actually matters to you and to your family and to the broader community
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000 in a really major way, in a way that's much more significant
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000 than you might think, and that your proclivity
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000 to abdicate your moral responsibility echoes way farther than you might consider,
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000 especially under some circumstances.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000 You know, in Solge Nitz and one of the things that's so amazing about the Gulagar
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000 Capalago is his story is not only of the absolute bloody catastrophe of the Soviet
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000 state, and his incredibly astute documentation of the role that the utopian
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000 political and philosophical assumptions of Marx's and played in creating the system,
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000 right?
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000 And then, in an aberration, it was a direct logical consequence of that
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000 collectiveist viewpoint, and to document all that, but also to tell
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000 English stories about people who were able at least to some degree
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000 to not become corrupt and even under unbelievably horrific conditions.
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000 And that's something you also get out of Victor Frankl's book,
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000 Man Search for Meaning, you know, and so the Gulagar Capalago
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000 is a story about horror in some sense, but it's more a story of the triumph
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000 of the fundamental triumph of the human spirit, and perhaps no more
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000 perhaps most evident in the case of Solge Nitz and himself,
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000 because he memorized this book in some sense while he was in the camps,
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000 and then wrote it under extreme duress afterwards, and it's an immense undertaking,
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000 and it's unbelievably emotionally intense, the entire book.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000 It's like one, you know, 1,700 page scream of outrage.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000 You just can hardly believe that someone can write at that white-hot
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000 intensity for such a long period of time, and, you know, his book had an unbelievable
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000 global impact, I think it's sold 30 million copies, and it definitely,
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000 for at least a reasonable period of time, made it completely untenable for
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000 utopian, resentful utopian intellectuals to ethically justify their radical
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000 leftist collectivism. It just blew the slats out from underneath any ethical
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000 credibility that communism, that remained of the communist doctrine by the 1970s,
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000 and that's a hell of a thing for someone to manage on their own.
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000 It's a pretty big task.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000 So while you were going through that, I was thinking myself, so I was talking to
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000 I still talk to military folks, and I was talking to some military leaders
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000 young leaders, so like platoon level and company level leaders, so these are
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000 guys that are in charge of, you know, 40 guys or maybe 150 guys.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000 And, you know, you can have some real ethical problems, and one of the things that I
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000 said to this group was, I said, hey, in your, in your platoon, you've got a
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000 murderer in your platoon. You've got someone in your platoon that is a
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000 sadist. And they were kind of looking at me, um, suspect. You know, a
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000 little bit like, come on now. Come on. What are you talking about?
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000 How big is the platoon?
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000 Well, platoon is 40 guys. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And so I was actually going to ask you how
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000 accurate I was, and then I was going to actually say that no matter what you say
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000 how accurate is, even if it was even if it was one out of every thousand, you
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000 have to act as a leader as if in your platoon, you've got one of those
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000 guys or two of those guys. That's the way you need to act. Well, you look and
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000 there's another book called the rape of Nandkeng. We've covered that.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000 Yeah. Well, so one of the things that was really horrifying about that book
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000 is so imagine that there's maybe let's say that there's one and a hundred just for
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000 the sake of argument that's really got cruel and psychopathic traits.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000 What do you think professionally? What do you think that number is? Oh, I think
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000 one percent isn't unreasonable. It could be higher than that. I mean,
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000 there's gradations, right? You know, there's probably in a group of 40 people,
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000 there's going to be one guy in there who's proclivity in that direction is
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000 sufficiently strong so that you better keep an eye on him. That's for sure.
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000 And this is a group of people that joined the millets. Right. So they're already,
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000 you've already gotten, you've already got a group that's okay with, with
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000 theoretically having to kill other people. Right. So this is probably,
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000 you know, so if it's 100,000. Yeah. That's, that's likely an under estimate.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000 So I think your estimate is perfectly reasonable and it might be
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000 conservative. What happened in Nandkeng was that the most
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000 sadistic people became the targets of imitation and emulation.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000 And that's when things really get out of hand. Yeah. Right. So, and that's the same thing
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000 for me, I'm a massacre. And that was, so when I was talking to this group,
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000 and I'm getting, and I said to them, I said, you're looking at me like,
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000 right now, like, I'm like, I don't know what I'm talking about. Like, I'm crazy.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000 Who knows about the me, I'm a masker? And, and you know, all of a sudden,
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000 it got quiet because if you know anything about the me, I'm a masker.
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000 It was a normal group of guys. It was a normal group of guys.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000 It was a normal company of American soldiers. And you know what they'd been through
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000 some stress. They'd been through, you know, they'd had their friends killed and
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000 it was in Vietnam. There was no one really to react against or to take your
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000 aggression out on because the enemy, you can see them. They would hide and it
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000 was. But then they turned and they snapped. And the same thing.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000 You had the leader, a guy named Lieutenant Callie, who is the
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000 little tune leader, who, I love for you to do a psychological profile.
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000 Maybe he's one of these guys. It was kind of like, it was totally
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000 insecure about everything. And so he got those shoulder boards on, which is
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000 the way the way a soldier needs to describe his experience as being a
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000 tune leader. And what it did to him and he goes through that, this
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000 book is fantastic to hear when he talks about what he did. He was looking
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000 back saying, oh, I did this and I did this into this little rampage of
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000 things that he, how he acted as a commander. I ate the food, the good
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000 food right in front of my guys when they weren't good for, I was getting
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000 the good food and he did a took advantage of all the little, all the
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000 little comforts that you got being an officer.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000 Yeah, well, he was trying in the whole book, and especially in that
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000 section, which I think is in volume two, which I think is the greatest
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000 of the three volumes, especially the last half of it, which is just
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000 absolutely, it's it's genius level writing, unbelievably
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000 compelling and brilliant. And yeah, I mean, he, he said that when he
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000 was in the camps that one of the things that he did, especially
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000 once he started to identify people that he truly admired was to go over
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000 his life with a fine tooth comb and try to, try to remember everything
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000 that he did wrong by his own estimation and then try to set it right
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000 in some manner. And so there was a, that's a repentance and then a
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000 redemption, right? There's a real, there's a real fundamental, like a
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000 medieval Christian undertone to all of that. But it, what, one of
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000 the things that's quite interesting is that when you talk about
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000 issues that are this serious, you're almost inevitably in a
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000 situation where you're going to find yourself compelled to use
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000 some kind of quasi-religious language because you end up discussing
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000 good and evil and issues of redemption and issues of repentance and
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000 issues of conscience and seeing and all of that. There isn't
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000 language that's deep enough to get out, otherwise. And what
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000 socializing it's indeed was scour his conscience and try to put
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000 himself together, partly because he was shamed, he was a
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000 shamed of himself in the face of these extraordinarily extraordinary
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000 people who seem to be able to keep their moral compass under circumstances
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000 where no one should ever assume that they would keep their moral
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000 compass because certainly, like I said, when I was reading this
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000 the Gulag and other books like that, I never assumed that if I was in
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000 those situations that I would have been one of the people who kept their head
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000 and were able to withstand the temptation to become a trustee for
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000 example and to take things the easy way and to lured it over the other
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000 prisoners and to adopt that position of authority. You know, it's like
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000 it's like a head slave among slaves. But you know, you could say,
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000 well, better to be the head slave than to be the bottom slave. And
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000 well, that's true in some sense with regards to creature comfort,
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000 but as socialists and point out points out, it might be a little bit
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000 hard on your soul and that actually turns out to be something of
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000 crucial, not only crucial importance psychologically, but crucial
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000 importance sociologically and politically because if you
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000 sacrifice that, then you warp the structure around you, which is exactly
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000 what happened in the establishment of these camps. You know, and the
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000 Soviet Union was just one big lie. What was their old joke?
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000 They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. It's like the
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000 whole, the whole book and the whole Soviet Union, when you read
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000 about it now, it seems like it seems like a bad joke. It seems like
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000 a bad movie. You couldn't just the way the way that
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000 Stalin would do something and the way that that order would come
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000 out. It seems like one of those cheesy, you know, comedic movies
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000 about these decisions that they're making. And it's surreal.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000 It's completely, it's completely insane. You know, at one point
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000 he's talking about the, there was a new penalty for what they
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000 called, clipping corn or, or, yeah, that basically a 12 year old kid
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000 would be starving going to a field that we didn't. And
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000 clip a cure a corn. And that happened in the Ukraine during the
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000 decolocation, right? It was against the law to go out after the
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000 fields were harvested. It was against the law to go out and
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000 pick grain off the ground to feed your family. Right. And the prison
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000 sentence was like a tenor, which is their little word for ten years.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000 So you're going to get, you steal a piece of corn or you pick up
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000 corn off the ground and you're getting ten years.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000 Yeah. You can't comprehend that that is a very large
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000 conversation that worked. Yeah. And they were, they, you know,
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000 he did in the earlier parts of the book when he starts going through
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000 the trials that they were doing on people. Yeah.
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000 And it's completely crazy. Yeah.
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000 Let's can't comprehend the cure.
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000 Yeah. Well, that's why I hate to see the kangaroo court
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000 submerging all over, all over the West, you know, and, and, and
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000 with the university sort of at the forefront of that.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000 So we're building these alternative court systems constantly that
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000 don't follow standard legal procedure. And it's really,
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000 we're messing with things that that we shouldn't be
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000 messing with. And yeah, the whole, I mean, there are, there
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000 are accounts. I believe it's in the Gulag of, of, of a
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000 pause after a stellen speech, right? Where people would
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000 stand up and applaud and they, and they'd applaud until until
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000 literally the old people were falling over because if you were the
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000 first person to stop applauding, then you were, well, it was
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000 off to the camps with you. No, he absolutely outlines it.
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000 So that, that sounds so crazy to say. And he, he outlines a
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000 specific thing that happened. It's that right there. These,
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000 no one will stop applauding because they're afraid they're going
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000 to get ratted out by their, by everyone else. Yeah. Well,
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000 by the people who are in fact watching. And I mean, you know,
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000 with by by the end by by the by the collapse of East
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000 Germany, one third of the people were in for in
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000 formers for the state. And so if you had a family of six
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000 people, two of your family members were direct government
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000 informers. You know, and it's, it's so, it's, it's creepy
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000 in some sense. And it's a very weak word to use in this
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000 situation. But when I was at New York University talking to
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000 Jonathan Height about, I don't know, it was about a few
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000 months ago. He just wrote that book called The
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000 Carling of the American Mind, you know, and he took me into
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000 one of the men's washrooms there. And there's a poster on
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000 the wall asking students to turn each other in for
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000 instances of bias or offensive speech. And they have a whole
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000 bureaucracy that's designed to do nothing else. But
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000 they're not just going to do that. But they're going to
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000 educate these instances of biased speech. And these posters are
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000 up on the walls as if this is something to be proud of.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000 You know, and the same thing is happening now in
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000 Scotland with the Scottish police are doing exactly the same
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000 thing. They're asking citizens to turn each other in for
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000 hate crimes. You know, and the problem with that is the
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000 fundamental problem with that. And the, the unsolvable
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000 problem with that is that the people who are
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000 going to be in the state are going to be in the state.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000 And where's the line drawn? It's like, well, anything that
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000 upsets me that you say is hate. That, and then, and it's
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000 worse than that. It's like, what happens is the people who
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000 define hate end up being those who are looking to take
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000 offense so that they can find someone they can define as a
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000 victimizer so that they can persecute them morally and
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000 justify that inner sadism. And those are the people who end up
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000 in the state. Well, we're doing this to make our society a safe
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000 place. It's absolutely, it's absolutely dreadful. And to see
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000 that happening in the UK was just, it's just awful because I mean,
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000 you know, the UK is a center, a center point of the idea of
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000 free speech. I mean, a lot of American, obviously, a lot of
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000 American ideals. America is a great center of free speech, but
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000 I mean, it's a variation on the English system. So to see that
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000 happening in the UK is just, it's awful. And to see the
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000 politics doing this and being, you know, encouraged by the
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000 politicians and, and to see this put forward as some sort of
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000 moral action. It's just, well, it's, it's an echo of this
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000 kind of catastrophe that we're discussing.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000 So I think about that sometimes. And I also have a
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000 tendency to look at things and not not be too worried about
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000 like, hey, come on. Yeah. What's really going to happen? Right? And
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000 that's, yeah, that's actually part of my personality and
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000 part of that comes from my old job where, hey, I can't
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000 worry about these little things. So there's some little
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000 problem going on over there. That's, that's not going to be,
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000 that's not going to affect us. It's not going to, and you got to
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000 pay attention a little bit, but make sure it doesn't get out of
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000 hand. But that thing about speech and you just mentioned the
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000 the cool lock. So that's a cool lock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000 They were the Ukrainian, they were the Ukrainian farmers who were
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000 good at farming. When I read this part, it got me worried about
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000 my own personal laxedasical attitude towards things that I
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000 think, oh, that's not what we do. Let me read this little
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000 section about the, about the escalation of the word
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000 cool act. Yeah. And where it started and where it ended up.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000 Yeah. That's good. That's so, here we go. In Russian, a
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000 cool act is amazingly dishonest, rural trader who grows rich
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000 not by his own labor, but through someone else's. In every
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000 locality, even before the revolution, such cool acts could
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000 be numbered on one's fingers. And the revolution totally
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000 destroyed their basis of activity. Subsequently after
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000 1917, by a transfer of meaning, the name cool act began to
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000 be applied to all those who in any way hired workers. Even if
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000 it was only even if it was only when they were temporarily
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000 short of working hands in their own families. But then
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000 that doesn't stop there. The inflation of this scathingly
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000 term of this scathing term, cool, cool act preceded
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000 relentlessly. And by 1930, all strong peasants in general
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000 were being so called, all peasants strong in management,
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000 strong in work, or even strong merely in convictions. The
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000 term cool act was used to smash the strength of the
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000 peasantry. And I got to go a little bit further because
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000 hell of a thing for the workers party to do. Yeah. They
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000 went further though. Beyond this, in every village, there
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000 were people who in one way or another had personally gotten
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000 in the way of the local activists. This was the perfect
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000 time to settle accounts with them of jealousy and the
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000 insult. These are the people you were just talking about. A new
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000 word was needed for these new victims as a class. And it
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000 was born. By this time, it had no social or an economic
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000 content whatsoever, but it had a marvelous sound.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000 Pond Kulakchnik. And that meant a person
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000 who was the only victim to the
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000 thing. And it was a different kind of thing.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000 And it was a person who was the leading
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000 the co-lax, in other words, I consider you an
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000 accomplice of the enemy. And that's all it tells. Yeah. Well,
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000 one of the things I tried to outline in my foreword to the
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000 bridge version was I was thinking about this idea of
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000 the idea of the idea of the foundation that was
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000 the foundation that was defined by our collective identity. And
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000 that the proper narrative in relationship to our collective identity is
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000 one of victim victimizer, which is a replay of the old Marxist
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000 doctrine of bourgeoisie and proletariat. It's just in its new
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000 guys. I mean, in that new guys developed at least in
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000 part in response to the Gulagarch-Pellagal because the old
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000 proletariat, bourgeoisie distinction became morally
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000 unfair. And it's just a very serious point out that you're
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000 status as a victimizer or a victim is actually the intersection of
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000 your multiple identities. And so, and that's actually the
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000 Achilles heel of the collectiveist notion. And we can get into
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000 why that is. But there's a horror that goes along with that
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000 that people that's not obvious that I think contributed to
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000 exactly why the Russian Revolution went so horribly wrong.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000 And that is that so imagine that I could characterize you
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000 in five or six different dimensions of group identity. It's pretty easy.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000 And while you're male, you're male of a certain age, you're male of
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000 a certain age and economic class. You have a certain sexual
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000 orientation, you have a certain ethnicity. You have a certain race.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000 That's six groups right there. And we could continue.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000 You know, your parents had a certain socioeconomic class and so
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000 did your grandparents. And then your ethnic group had a
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000 certain privilege or luck thereof. And you're a
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000 tractive or you're not a tractive or you're intelligent or you're
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000 not intelligent. There's temperamental variability. Like there's all sorts of ways of
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000 characterizing you according to your group. Okay, now we might say that
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000 if we were compassionate people that we would take one of those
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000 group identities or more and look at where your
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000 dispossessed and victimized. Okay, and we're going to find some
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000 dimension along which your less privileged than some people.
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000 Like maybe you come from a working class background, despite the fact that
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000 you're like a straight male. And so you can be a victim on that dimension.
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000 And so, and that's kind of, that's at least in part,
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000 an element of intersectional theory, right? And that maybe
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000 your, your, your oppression is the product of of your
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000 multiple victim like identities. But that can easily be
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000 reversed because it's absolutely the case that I can take any
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000 person. And I can do a multi-dimensional analysis of their group
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000 identities. And I can find at least one dimension along which they're the
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000 perpetrator, not the victim. They're the victimizer, not the victim.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000 And as soon as I can identify a dimension along which they're a
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000 victimizer, then that justifies their persecution. And so one of the things that you
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000 saw happening in the Russian Revolution, and it's very much a
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000 kind of what you just described was that the, the, the, the
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000 borders of who, who was valiantly accused of being a
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000 victimizer, essentially expanded to include everyone. And that's
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000 actually right in, it's, in a perverse sense, it's right because
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000 if you position yourself properly in, in the historical flow,
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000 then you should see yourself as a perpetrator and a victim equally.
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000 Well, it's not the right way to see yourself at all, but if you're going to
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000 play that game, you're going to be on both sides of it. And then that
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000 issue is, and this is related to your idea about, you know, in your
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000 opinion, you've got one person who's sadistic. It's like, okay, well,
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000 let's even assume that at the beginning of the Russian
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000 Revolution that the vast majority of the people who were motivated by
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000 communism were actually compassionate with regards to the
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000 dispossessed peasantry. Now, I don't believe that, but we could say that
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000 that was even a significant minority. Well, the question is, did you just say
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000 on it? What was your, what was your hypothetical percentage? Well,
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000 well, let's say, well, let's say it's 20% or let's even say it's 50% of
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000 people who are genuinely motivated by compassion for the
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000 dispossessed. But then there's another minority, maybe we could even
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000 say it was only 10% to begin with, who weren't motivated by that at all.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000 They were motivated by the jealousy and the spite and the, and the, and the
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000 resentment that socials and it's in describes. And they were the ones who
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000 are after those to be persecuted. And the thing is, they got
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000 up her hand really rapidly. And it might be because the carnivorous
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000 types, the predatory types are much more dangerous and powerful than the
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000 compassionate types. They'll take them out instantly. We're willing to
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000 step up and smash someone. Yes. The people that are saying, oh, we just
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000 want to help. Yes, exactly. Well, and there's someone I actually
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000 cited a guy named, I think his name was Walter Latsus in the
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000 forward, who wrote in a journal called Red Terror that if you were
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000 interrogating an enemy of the state, you didn't bother with
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000 niceties like their individual guilt. That was a bourgeoisie
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000 conceit. And that's really important thing to keep in mind. What you
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000 wanted to do is to do a class-based analysis and find out, well, are they
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000 a member of, let's say, the coolac or the affiliates of the coolacs,
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000 which is a lovely way of expanding your list of potential victims. And then
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000 you execute accordingly. And that would mean, well, the person that you're
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000 interrogating, right, or the class member that you're interrogating, and then
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000 their children, and perhaps also their grandchildren. And Latsus
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000 himself was eventually executed by the Stella and somebody wrote to me
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000 after I wrote the forward and told me that that was his eventual
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000 fate. And I thought, well, talk about standing on a chair and putting the
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000 news around your own neck and kicking it out from underneath you.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000 It's like, you know, he basically he murdered himself,
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000 fundamentally. And you know, you could say in some sense, that was the
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000 story of the Soviet Union to a tremendous degree.
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000 Yeah, there's one part going back to the ever expanding
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000 people that need to be destroyed. There's a point in the book where he
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000 starts, he's saying, hey, look, there's insects.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000 Stalin's just described, or maybe his lenin was describing these
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000 certain people as insects that need to be destroyed. And then he just
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000 that that just starts off with, hey, people that are
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000 browsers, they're insects. And then it just expands and expands.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000 And then it's got priests. And then it's got engineers and
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000 physicians and physicians. And everyone in records.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000 Yeah, records. That's the word that they use or that he uses in the book
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000 for, uh, first basically saboteurs. Yeah. And that expands beyond
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000 comprehension. Yeah, because at every single problem that there is
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000 is the fault of some person out there that sabotages. And they
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000 do this show trial. And he talks about it in the book for, I think
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000 I think the phrase that he uses is or that they use at the
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000 Russian that the Soviets used was organizers of the famine.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000 Meaning like, oh, yeah, you're starving. And these people over here,
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000 they're the reason you're these people that organize the
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000 famine. They're the records of production of food.
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000 You bet. Well, it was either that, you know, you imagine that
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000 you adopt a worldview and that worldview enables you to at least
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000 in principle organize yourself with other people and to provide you with a certain amount of
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000 psychological stability. And then things go dreadfully wrong. And then you have a choice
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000 which is to re-evaluate your worldview, which is of course what
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000 social medicine does in the Gulagar Capalago in a very deep ways.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000 Reorganizes entire worldview. Or you can look for reasons why you're right
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000 and these things are happening. And socialists and talks a lot in the Gulagar
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000 Capalago about, see, he had a moral condendrum when he was in prison and he
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000 started his moral awakening, let's say. And he was trying to figure out how to
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000 treat other people who are imprisoned. He had a real moral condendrum
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000 when a committed communist was dragged into the Gulag system, which happened all the
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000 time. He said those people were in particularly dire
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000 rights because not only had they been subject to the entire tyrannical weight of the
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000 deceitful state, but it was at the hands of their own comrades and friends.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000 And then the committed communist would enter the Gulag and they would still be
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000 in their morally superior phase, right, that their incarceration was a
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000 mistake and that things would be set right and that there was nothing wrong with the
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000 system and they would attempt to justify it. And soleson it's and was never
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000 sure how to react to these people ethically because on the one hand, well, they
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000 were devastated because now they were political prisoners and maybe they got a
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000 20-year sentence and they were in terrible stripped of their family and just
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000 ruined. But on the other hand, they were still avid supporters of the very
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000 fist that had crushed them. And so his eventual conclusion was that until they
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000 broke and repented, they weren't to be allied with. They were still
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000 essentially on the side of the while of the perpetrator and it seems to me that
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:52.000 that's right, that's that's unrepentant sin, let's say. And it isn't until you
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000 what would you say? Until you take responsibility for your own complicitness in
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000 your unfair interrogation that you get to join the ranks of of of
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:11.000 valuable and suffering humanity again. And so yeah, it's the extension of the
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000 persecution is really something that's horrifying to see how who
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000 constituted a victimizer, the ranks of who constituted a victimizer just grew and
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000 grew and grew. One of the most shocking groups of people that ended up in
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000 the Gulag's were the dam Soviet soldiers that had just got back to the
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000 fight. Just not out of the same sort of thing you can't make up.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000 Yeah, you can't make that up. I'm getting the solution to who was like in
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000 close combat with the enemy. And he wrote a letter to one of his buddies and
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000 said, yeah, this doesn't seem like to be a great decision by Stalin.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000 Yeah. And next thing you know, he's in prison. Yeah, well, the
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000 Stalin, Stalin decided that, yeah, this is something that you can't you can't
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000 believe this. Well, it is, there is this like it's like, you know, if there's
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000 something satanic at the bottom of this, you know, mythologically speaking,
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000 there's also something that's like a cosmic, it's like cosmic black humor.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000 It's like the sign on Auschwitz that said, work will set you free. You know,
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000 if that's a joke, right, it's a, it's a terrible, terrible, dark joke.
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000 And so much of this has the element of exactly that kind of surreal,
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000 I hate to say humor, but it's, it's right. I mean, Stalin decided that the,
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000 okay, so the Soviet prisoners of war were not covered by the Geneva
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000 Convention for the treatment of prisoners of war, because Stalin refused
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000 to sign that agreement. So like if you were an allied prisoner of the
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000 Germans, it wasn't like you were having a great time of it. Like food was
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000 in short supply and you were treated pretty brutally, but the Soviets were kept
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000 separately and they were doing so badly that the Allies used to throw
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000 food packets over the fence when that was an option. So the Soviet prisoners
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000 of war were treated absolutely dreadfully and, and, and Stalin didn't
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000 care about that. And then when they were released and went back to the
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000 Soviet Union, his dictum was that because they had been exposed to the
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000 capitalist West or even the Nazi West for that matter that they had now
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000 been intolerably corrupted on ideological grounds and had to be put in the
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000 prison camps. So that was the, that was your destiny as, you know, I mean,
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000 first of all, you were a frontline Russian soldier, which was just
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000 brutal beyond belief. Their army was completely unprepared for Hitler's
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000 invasion because Stalin trusted Hitler in his strange way. And so they
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000 were completely unprepared. And of course, then fighting in the Soviet Union
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000 with its winters, I mean, you just, you just can't imagine what that
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000 must have been like. And then to be thrown in a prisoner of war camp
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000 at the bottom of the wrong and then to be brought back to your country.
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000 And then to be imprisoned as a traitor because as a class you'd be
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000 exposed to the wrong ideology. It's like you just, it's, it's, it's
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000 unimaginably vile and surreal at the same time. And it, it, it,
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000 it, it, it shake your head. It, for me, well, it's such a shock to read the
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000 Gulagkar Capelago. It, it, it, it, it just can't, it's, it's, it's like
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000 it's like it, it isn't like Dante's in front of. It's like a trip into
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000 hell. Yeah, yeah, and I guess you're, that's what I was trying to say
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000 with when we started this conversation, I was trying to say that
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000 it's like you're watching this, like like you said, it's like a
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000 bad comedy movie. And you'd think, well, that's that'd be really
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000 that. You'd think, you know, when you, when you take a comedy, one of
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000 the things, one of the ways you can make people laugh is to take something
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000 ordinary and maybe make it much more extreme in the more extreme.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000 You make it the more funny it becomes. That's what, like, happened here.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000 You're looking at this thing going, hey, oh, yeah, they, they seem to be trying to
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000 make this funny because who, in, could ever conceive that you could
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000 take your front line soldiers who are captured and in, in misery.
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000 And when they return home, instead of treating them like heroes,
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000 instead, you put them back into a prison. We're swan, even. You can't even,
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000 you can't even, that's just, that's, no, you can't make this stuff.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000 You can't make it up. No, did you see, I believe that movie was the
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000 death of Stalin? I did not see it. That's worth seeing because it's,
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000 it's very interesting because one of the things about that movie is that
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000 it captures that surreal element because it's a black comedy, you know,
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000 and, and there are comical things happening in the movie in that
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000 terrible dark way, constantly, at the same time that in the background
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000 genuinely terrible things are happening. So it's that horrible,
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000 it's, it's got that horrible, satirical flavor that runs through books
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000 like the Gulagar Capelago, where you think, well, there's just no,
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000 this is so absurd that there's no possible way it could have occurred.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000 And yet, that's not only did it happen, there was like a contest
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000 to top the absurdity, you know, to, to, to consider the engineers, for example,
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000 records is, well, these people were building the, so the,
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000 it's system to the degree that it was built, and then to turn around and
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000 accuse exactly those people of being the ones who destroy and
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000 undermine it. It's, it's, it's part of, I really think that
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000 what's, what underlies this, whatever this is. And I think this is
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000 what manifests itself in the worst of the leftist collectivism is a real
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000 hatred for anything that smacks of competence at all. Like, I, I tried to
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000 imagine those Russian villages, because I come from a small town, a
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000 small northern town too. So I kind of, I tried to imagine, so imagine
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000 that you're in an isolated village, and it's a peasant village,
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000 and the peasants weren't freed that long ago, right? They were
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000 basically surfs until, until about the middle of the second half of the
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000 19th century. And so they had been emancipated, and then some of
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000 those people who were emancipated, got a little bit of land, and
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000 started to have a life, you know, it started to be successful pezons.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000 And they were also the people that grew the bulk of the crops, because
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000 what you see happening in any productive domain is that a small
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000 percentage of people do almost all the productive work. So there's
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000 a small percentage of productive farmers who grew all the crops,
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000 right? And then there's all sorts of farmers who were only
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000 farmers by name, and they weren't successful at all. So you have,
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000 and then there was a certain relationship between being
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000 productive as a farmer, and developing some wealth, maybe had a house
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000 and maybe you could hire a person or two, you know, and which you
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000 think would actually be a good thing, especially if you're also
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000 growing food. Okay, so imagine you get a village, and now there's
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000 a bit of a socioeconomic pyramid, and there's some people that
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000 are doing well, and they're really, and there are, and it isn't
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000 the crooked people that are really annoying, though people who, like
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000 the genuine cool acts, let's say that that small percentage of
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000 psychopathic types who were basically profiting criminally off the
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000 efforts of others. Those aren't so annoying those people because
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000 they're rich, but they don't deserve it. And so they don't
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000 stand towards you as a moral ideal that shames you. But the
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000 really annoying people are the ones who are doing well and
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000 deserve it, especially if you're someone who's doing nothing and
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000 is better. Okay, so now, so there's the village, and you've
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000 got your people who are doing all right, and then you've got a huge
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000 strad of people who aren't upset about the people who are doing
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000 well, they might even admire them and be happy that they're
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000 around because they're making the community thrive and growing
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000 some food. Then you have this little strad at the bottom of
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000 people who are near-do wells and on the more psychopathic end of
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000 things, and they're bitter and resentful and waiting for their
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000 bloody opportunity. And then the communist intellectuals
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000 come into town and say, you know those people that are doing
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000 well, they actually, everything they've got is ill-
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000 gotten and they stole it and they stole it from you from you.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000 And look at how badly you're doing and the reason you're doing
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000 badly is because these people who are lording it over you and
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000 who have all this creature comfort, they took that from you.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000 It's yours by right. And so then all that resentment and
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000 jealousy and hatred and rage alcohol fueled as you might well
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000 imagine has this moral reason to go with pitchforks and
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000 any in a mob and surround those houses and to strip them of everything
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000 they have and to rape the women and to kill the occupants or to
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000 ship them off to the middle of Siberia when they were they
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000 froze to death because there were no or died of dysentery or
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000 or whatever other plague managed to, you know, we've
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000 its way through these camps. And so you have the intellectuals
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000 providing the moral rationale for the worst ethical actors in
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000 these small villages doing the worst possible things under the
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000 guys of compassion. Right. And that's part of that victim
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000 victimizer narrative. It's just. And you know, like you can
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000 imagine that, you can imagine a dark night, you can imagine
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000 the winter, you can imagine the alcohol, you can imagine the
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000 rage that fuels these people who are drinking too much in the
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000 pubs that have been sitting there for the last 20 years like
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000 what would you say eating up their own souls with resentment and
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000 bitterness and then someone comes in and says you're the true
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000 victim here and here's the people that you can go after. And
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000 then like if you play that on your imagination, you get some real
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000 sense of exactly what sort of horror that would produce. You
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000 know, you think about the rape, for example, or just the
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000 theft or but it's the rape that you can really think about
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000 as as absolute revenge for all that bitter resentment all
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000 fueled by the fact that, you know, you'd sat there for the
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000 last 20 years being completely goddamn useless and bitter
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000 hatred and angry and and and and fantasizing about the day
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000 that would come where you'd have your opportunity. God and then
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000 the whole country and that was the whole country.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Just unbelievable. Yeah, I think he spells that out very
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000 clearly and he says it's you know what he's saying. You know,
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000 I'm saying that you got a psychopath in your plateau. He
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000 saying that psychopath all that psychopath needs to flip is is the
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000 is someone to tell him that's the right thing to do. And that's
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000 exactly what happened when you said that's it. That's it.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000 Guys that were slightly psychopathic. Yeah. And then it
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000 becomes okay. I'm the I'm the head psychopath and you're in my
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000 village. And you're let's say you're one of those people
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000 that are in the middle. Well, who's side are you going to be on?
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000 I'm a psychopath if you if you're not on my side, I'm going to
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000 kill you next. Yeah. So you go, well, no, I'm on your side too.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000 And that's what it was. Well, and it doesn't take luck. It's not like
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000 it takes much pressure on people to have them fold. I mean, one of
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000 the things you see you see happening right now in our
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000 cultures. That's happening to people all the time with these
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000 Twitter wars. You know, someone will say something. They'll
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000 express an opinion and then they'll get mobbed by and but
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000 only abstractly, right? It's not like there's pitch for
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000 wielding mobs at their house. And I'm not making light of it.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000 It's no, it's no pleasant thing to be mobbed on Twitter. But
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000 that's an abstraction compared to these people showing up at
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000 your house. And what will happen is that people will go
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000 through an object apology. You know, and they'll say, well, I
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000 really didn't mean it. And now I understand what my privileges and
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000 I see how what I said could have been very hurtful to people. And
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000 you know, they they wander through that entire apology and fold
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000 almost instantly. And that's under almost almost no pressure.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000 Compared to what real pressure is. And real pressure is when the
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000 wolves are actually at your door rather than just barking
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000 off in the distance. But people will fold just when they're
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000 barking in the distance. So there's one lawyer that he talks
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000 about in here is the same thing as the story that you described.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000 And I forget the guy's name. But this guy was like the premier
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000 prosecuting lawyer for the Soviet government. And he just
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000 rips people apart over and over again. And as you read about
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000 what happens in sure enough, he's one of the guys that didn't
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000 up on the offensive and yeah. Being executed. Yeah. Like
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:09.000 they still see people. They built a place of butchery and
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000 then through themselves into it. You know, that's an
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000 and you see. So it's in documents this very carefully. I mean
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000 Stalin killed all the people who were foremost actors in
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000 the Russian Revolution. Right. So I mean everyone was fed
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000 into the great grinding machine. So and and Stalin
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000 himself. I mean it looked to me like see he got
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000 himself into something approximating a positive feedback loop
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000 which is very dangerous thing to have happened. And I think
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000 socializing doesn't a lovely job of detailing this as well.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000 So it's like imagine that I have a fair amount of content
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000 for people to begin with. And then I find that people are
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000 not trusting person and I find that I'm very paranoid about
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000 the fact that people are lying to me. And then I develop a
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000 certain amount of power and a reputation. Well then people
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000 really do start lying to me all the time in every gesture.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000 You know, because every time they come near me they're
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000 absolutely terrified and they're going to tell me anything
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000 that I want to hear. And of course then all that does
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000 is validate my view of how pathetic and contemptible
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000 everyone is. And so in the more that view gets validated
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000 the more I think that it's okay to destroy people because
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000 look at how pathetic and contemptible they are, how they always
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000 lie. And all that means is that they lie even more. And so this
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000 whole thing just spirals out of control. And you know,
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Stalin basically started out as as the brutal
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000 enforcement henchmen for henchmen for Lenin, right?
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000 The killer for hire. And not like Lenin was above
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000 that sort of thing himself. But he trained Stalin. And
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000 then Stalin's proclivity to be murderous just kept
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000 expanding without limit. Right? First of all, it was
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000 individuals and then it was groups and then it was
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000 nations and then well by the end of his life. Well what
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000 was it the plot to destroy the entire world?
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000 To initiate the third world war to wipe out Europe to
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000 maybe destroy everything. And like there's no limit.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000 There was no limit to that. You know, and there's some
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000 evidence that that's perhaps why he was killed. You know,
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000 because Stalin himself even went too far for the horrible
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000 horrible, what semi. The corrupted
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000 compatriots that he had arranged around himself. He went too far
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000 even for them. And thank God for that, you know, but
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000 yeah, it's absolute. I mean, the thing that the
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000 Gulagkar, Gulagkar, Gulagkar, Gulagkar, Gulagkar
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000 did for me. And this was also in keeping as a
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000 consequence, also of reading Yung at the same time, but
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000 it was certainly the Gulagkar in large part that it
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000 did it. I would say that in some sense it's scared me
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000 straight. I thought I see the consequences of unethical
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.000 behavior deceit the willingness to turn a blind eye.
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000 So even sins of a mission rather than sins of commission,
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000 just to turn a blind eye. The consequences of that are
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000 so absolutely dreadful that it's not acceptable. And I
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000 think that's the right lesson from the 20th century. It's that
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000 you, you, you, you have a much more important moral
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000 role to play in keeping things straight than you want to
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000 believe. You know, people think, well, my life is
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000 basically meaningless. It's like, well, that's quite
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000 terrifying. It's like, yeah, it's kind of terrifying, but
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000 it means you don't have any responsibility. So there's a
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000 big advantage to thinking that. You know, if nothing you do
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000 matters, then nothing you do matters. And so you can do
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000 whatever you want. And that's horrifying in a nihilistic
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000 sort of way, but there's another kind of horror that's more
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000 associated, I think, with the horror of Hellfire that was
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000 characteristic of the medieval Christian view is which is
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000 something like, and if you strip it of its metaphysics,
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000 it's something like, no, you don't get it. The things you do
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000 actually do, the things you do or don't do, they actually
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000 don't matter. And they tilt the world towards, you know, something
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000 approximating good, let's say, or towards something that very
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000 closely approximates Hell, and that's actually on you.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000 It's literally your fault. It's literally your responsibility.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000 It's like, man, that's a terrifying idea, but I can't see
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000 how you can read this literature without coming to that
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000 conclusion. Like, it wasn't one that I wanted to leap to, you know,
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000 because it's sort of the ultimate in horrifying conclusions that
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000 that everybody who participated in this system was that fault for
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000 all of it. And on Dusty F ski made the same sorts of claims in
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000 the last part of the 19th century. I mean, he was a very weird,
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000 mystical sort of person, you know, and he made claims or some of
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000 his characters to it, but on his behalf that, you know, not only are
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000 you responsible for everything you do, but in some sense you're
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000 responsible for everything that everyone else does too, and you
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000 know, obviously there's a way in which that isn't true.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000 You know, it's delusional in some sense, but there's another way in
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000 which it actually is true, you know, and so.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000 Well, I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership, and it's very
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000 interesting. So all this is a whole, um, fought here. So, you know,
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000 when I read the book about face, which is not about leadership.
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000 It's not a leadership book. It's a book about a guy that was in
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000 the leadership position, but he doesn't say, here's how you lead.
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000 Here's what you do here. It's a book about his experience and what I
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000 took away from it, especially because I was in leadership positions
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000 in the military and combat situations that I started seeing all
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000 these leadership things that he did, and there's all this
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000 crossover because, for instance, and so for me, the crossover
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000 was, well, I started learning about tactics when I was a young kid
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000 because I was in the military as in the SEAL teams, and you had to
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000 learn about how to fire maneuver. Like, that's what you do.
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000 And then so you start learning about leadership, and then I started
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000 training a lot of jiu-jitsu, and so those things kind of all
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000 fit together. And it's very strange how those things started
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000 to weave together in my head that, oh, if on the battlefield,
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000 if you want to attack the enemy, you don't do it head on.
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000 You flank them. You distract them and then you flank them.
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000 You come in from the outside. In jiu-jitsu, if you want to
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000 submit your opponent, you don't just grab their arm. No, you
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000 start to choke them. And while they're defending the
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000 choke, then you get their arm. And as a leader, if you want somebody
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000 to do something, you just don't bark that order at them.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000 You flank them and you let them understand why it's happening.
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000 And when I started this podcast that I do, I would start it
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000 off by saying, in the beginning, I'd say, that's a podcast about
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000 leadership viewed through the lens of war and atrocity.
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000 And the more I did it, it didn't take me very long.
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000 Where I was saying, well, it's actually a podcast about human nature.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000 Really is what it's actually about because the better you
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000 understand human beings, the better you'll be able to do as a
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000 leader because you'll understand what's happening with those
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000 dynamics, which I guess is now leading me into some sort of
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000 psychology. You're just kind of where you ended up with of of you
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000 read this book. And you said you were studying political
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000 science when you read this book. And then you said, oh, you
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000 looked at the psychology of it. And an example that you just
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000 brought up. And this is just what you learn when you read
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000 and when you understand history and when you understand the way people
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000 think, Stalin surrounded himself with people that would say yes to
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000 him. And anybody that didn't say yes to him, he killed them.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000 And I'll say this again. I'll talk to military.
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000 I also killed you if you said yes.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000 Yeah, the military for sure, but also any business
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000 leader, we talked to business leaders all the time.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000 And you don't want people. You don't want your
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000 subordinates or your superiors. When you tell them what to do,
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000 just nod their head and say yes, you don't want that.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000 Now, the immediate thought, especially for a military guy,
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000 they think there's nothing would make my job easier.
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000 Then if I bark in order you Jordan, you work from your
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000 private and on a captain and I bark in order you just
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000 shut up and go do it. That seems like the best thing in the
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000 world. It's absolutely not true. Because there's things
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000 that you know on the front lines that I don't know.
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000 And if I really want to be a good leader, I want you to
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000 push back on me and say, hey, boss, we don't want to do that.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000 Here's what's going on. Let me tell you the situation.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000 And instead of me, you want to be able to do that.
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000 You want to be able to teach your subordinates to do that without
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000 being in subordinate, right? Because then it's not a
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000 power play. It's that your interests are aligned.
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000 Our interests are aligned. And I actually, when I talk to the
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000 subordinates because I talk to subordinates too.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000 Yeah. And I say, listen, when you say something to your boss,
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000 you don't say why the hell are we doing that, boss?
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000 Yes. You actually have to be very tacky.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000 Yeah, exactly. Hey, hey, boss.
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000 I want to make sure I'm executing this exactly how you want to
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000 can you explain to me why we're doing this?
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000 So I can really, really make it happen out there in the field.
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000 Yeah. And that's a key thing.
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000 So these ideas of psychology, I guess, now is I hate to use that
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000 word, but because I've just called a human nature, but these ideas
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000 they all kind of come together. And so now you're talking about
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000 ownership, right? Extreme ownership. And this idea that,
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000 hey, I'm responsible for everything. And so here's what I get from
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000 a leader. They'll say, well, whether it's a business leader or
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000 it's very easy to use a military leader. So I'll get a
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000 platoon commander. My machine gunner shot in the wrong direction.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000 How can that be my fault? Because my machine gunner shot in the wrong
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000 direction. I'm not holding his weapon. I'm not pulling his
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000 trigger. How can that possibly be my fault? That's not my fault.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000 Wrong.
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000 Who's in charge of that machine gunner? Who's in charge of making sure he
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000 understands what it's field of his own fire? Who's in charge of making sure he
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000 understands when and where he's allowed to shoot you are. You're the boss.
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000 This is absolutely your fault. How did another interesting example of
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000 the weather? The weather's bad. We couldn't execute our mission.
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000 That's why we failed because we couldn't launch our helicopter.
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000 Yeah, it's not my fault. Yeah. That's a hard one to argue against.
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000 Yeah. Except for the fact that if you're a good leader, you'll say,
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000 hey, here's our plan. We're going to use these helicopters.
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000 And here's our contingency plan. If there's bad weather. If you don't take that
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000 ownership of what's going on, if you don't take responsibility for it,
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000 you're not going to change it. You're not going to fix it. And that
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000 means you're never going to get any better. You're not going to win.
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000 Right. But the minute you as in this and obviously this applies to
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000 people to purple. And you know, you tell people to take responsibility.
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000 I've, you know, tell them to take ownership of what's going on in your
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000 world. It's the same thing. But at the end of the day.
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000 Well, it's also, it's also seems to me to be the case. And I think that this
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000 is part of the ethic that's embedded in in it's deeply embedded in
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000 Christianity with the idea that the idea that the ultimate sacrifice that
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000 you can offer to the world is the sacrifice of yourself. So like,
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000 well, imagine that you have to sacrifice something to set the world
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000 right while you do obviously because you have to give up things now
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000 in order to make things better in the future. So the sacrificial idea is a
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000 little bit more important than the question might be, well, well, if you're going to
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000 sacrifice something, is it going to be someone else or is it going to be you?
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000 And I really think that's the fundamental question. And the right answer to that is
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000 that it's going to be you. It's your fault. Right. You take that on or at
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000 least you take on that responsibility. And it is, it's a weird thing.
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000 Weirdly difficult. It distinguish fault and responsibility. I think
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000 responsibility is the better way of thinking about it. But it's tied in with
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000 fault. If it doesn't go right, if it isn't going right, it's because you're not
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000 good enough. Now, that can be crushing. There is a problem with that.
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000 Like, and you see sometimes people who develop like psychotic depression.
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000 And they suffer from a delusional condition in some sense that the entire
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000 moral catastrophe of the world is literally their fault. And that's not,
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000 there's an element of that that's that's not productive. Although there's a
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000 lot of things that are really not good. And it's hard to find the balance so that
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000 you can take on that responsibility without it is simultaneously being
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000 a crushing weight because there's a lot of things in the world that are really
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000 not good. And if they're your fault, well, that's rather hard on you.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000 I mean, one of the things that the Catholic Church does to help people with
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000 that is that it gives them the opportunity to sort of wash their
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000 sins off themselves. Right. You can go to church and you can say, well, look,
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000 here's a bunch of ways that I've been being not who I could be. And the
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000 church authorities say, well, you know, that's not good. And you should
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000 straighten up and all of that and fly right. But human beings are
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000 fallible and you're fallible. And we can't just crush you because of
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000 your insufficiency. So we'll wash the slate clean and you can go out there
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000 and try again. And it's very hard to get the balance between those things
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000 right so that you can take the responsibility on without being crushed by it.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000 But but it's still the case that it seems to me that it's either your
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000 fault or it's someone else's. And as soon as it's someone else's, then
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000 you better be careful because that idea that it's someone else's is
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000 definitely going to appeal to the worst in you. That's definitely going to
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000 happen. And if you don't see that, then your naive or willfully blind
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000 and all that is going to do all that's all that that is going to do is
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000 make the situation worse. Yeah, especially because if it's not my fault and
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000 it's your fault and I can't control you. What do I do about it? I sit there
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000 and just suffer the consequences of the situation as opposed to, okay,
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000 here's what's going on. I'm going to take responsibility on our ship
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000 for them to change it. Make it happen. You talked about
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000 turning a blind eye. And earlier you talked about turning a blind eye
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000 to the truth to a situation. And I know there's a point in this book
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000 where he talks about the, he's got a buddy that says, the amnesty is
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000 coming. Right. Amnesty is coming. Let's just keep our mouth shut.
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000 Let's do what we're told to do and we'll get, you know, we'll get out
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000 and we'll get out. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, a social distance
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000 says, he said, okay, yeah. And then he says to himself, wait a minute.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:16.000 If I'm not, if I'm not living in order to live, then is it worth it?
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000 Mm-hmm. And this is a question that I get asked a lot
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000 because people get themselves into situations where they've lost
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000 some kind of control, whether it's there in a crappy job or they've got a
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000 bad boss or whatever, maybe they're in a bad relationship,
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000 maybe their families met, but they're in a situation. And they,
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000 and they don't know what to do. And part of them, I think,
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000 anticipate the answer from me to be listened. Hey, listen, if you're not,
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000 if you're not living in order to live, then that's wrong.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000 Mm-hmm. But what I actually tell them, universally almost,
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000 and there's a couple situations where it goes outside this,
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000 but what I tell them is what you need to do right now is you need to
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000 play the game. You need to play the game to get the situation
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000 to a point where you can act, right? So if you're, you got a bad boss,
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000 right? Oh, okay, you got a bad boss. I want to tell this guy to go
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000 to go screw himself. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, hey, guess what I'm going to do?
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000 When my boss tells me something to do that doesn't make much sense,
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000 you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to do it. And I'm going to do it
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000 well. And what am I doing? I'm building that relationship with him.
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000 He's starting to trust me. And these are going to tell me,
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000 to do something else. Now, these things are massive,
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000 catastrophes. It's like he's telling me to do something,
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000 maybe there's a better way to do it. You don't need to do it that way.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000 Mm-hmm. And I'm going to play that game. And I'm going to build up that
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000 relationship. Now, when eventually he tells me to do something that is
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000 totally stupid or it's going to cost lives or money,
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000 then when I say, hey, boss, that's not a great way to do it.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000 I think I know a better way could we try something else? He actually will
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000 listen to me. So I'm going to play the game a little bit.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000 And I'll tell you, my gut instinct. If now, I guess it's easy to look
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000 from the outside and say, hey, if I was in this prison camp,
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000 my gut instinct is like, okay, jok, or you know, you've been through these
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000 kind of things before, play the game. You're going to play the game.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000 Which is horrifying. Because part of playing that game to the
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000 fullest extent here or in an Aussie prison camp would be coming a
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000 couple. Oh, you're playing the game. Yeah. You're playing the game. Yeah.
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000 So, and that's really the outline that the things that I said that are
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000 outline, I always make the caveat that if you're getting asked to do
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000 something that's e-moral, illegal, or unethical, then you actually have a
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000 duty to say, no, I'm not going to do that. No, that's the line,
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000 which you know, which you reach that line in the sand with Bill C.
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000 16, which is, hey, I'm not going to do this. But the idea that
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000 sometimes you got to play the game. And sometimes even from you, when you
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000 just said to me, you know, sometimes you, it's not right to turn a blind
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000 eye on things. And it's like, sometimes you have to. If you want to
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000 get yourself to a position, like, my, my, my, my, my, it seems to me that
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000 you're making a distinction between discipline and strategy, like,
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000 you know, and, and, and, and, and, like, impulsive moral responding, you know,
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000 like, let's say that you are in a situation where you have a boss who's
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000 intolerable, and maybe what you'd like to do, you know, the resentment
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000 has built up over five years, and you'd like to go in there and, and
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000 yell at him and tell him everything you think. And you think, well, that's
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000 the truth. It's like, well, it's actually, it's not a very
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000 sophisticated truth, because you're doing a shallow and impulsive
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000 analysis of the situation. Like, it would have been the case
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000 that you've already compromised yourself in 500 ways, and I'll get back
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000 to the playing the game issue, because you do have to discipline yourself
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000 too, and, and you have to discipline yourself to, to some degree by
01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000 allowing yourself to do arbitrary things that are part of the
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000 system, right? That's a necessary part of discipline. And
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000 discriminating that from compliance with unethical activity is very
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000 difficult. So that's a hard situation. But let's say,
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000 you're going to counsel someone who has an intolerable boss, and they
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000 come in and they're right at the end of their tether, because maybe
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000 that's why they come for counseling. They say, I really want to
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000 tell that son of a bitch, what I think of it, and you think, well,
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000 wait a second here. Okay. First of all, you've already
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000 eradicated from the list of reasonable possibilities that
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000 decision by failing to say small things that you could have
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000 said all the way along. And it's not like you can just all
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000 of a sudden, blurred all of that out now, and that wipes the
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000 slate clean in that constitutes truth. It's too unsophisticated.
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000 So let's think, okay. So what is it that you want? Well, I don't
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000 want this job anymore. It's like, okay. Now, let's actually have a
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000 strategy about this then. You don't want this job anymore. Can you
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000 get another job? Well, I don't think so. Well, so you can't
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000 just quit. Well, no, I can't because then I don't have any money
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000 and my family depends on the job. It's like, okay. So you can't
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000 just stop this. That's not a viable solution. You go out of the
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000 frying pan into the fire, or you know, you suck, you substitute
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000 one set of unethical actions for another set of unethical
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000 actions that are even worse. That's not helpful. All right. So
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000 let's start thinking about what exactly it is that you want.
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000 It's like, well, maybe I want a better job. I want to work for
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000 someone who's more reasonable. Okay. So what's stopping you?
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000 Well, I don't have my CV in order. My resume isn't up to
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000 date. Well, why is that? Well, I haven't done it for five years and
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000 I don't like doing it. Well, why is that? Well, because I'm kind of
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000 embarrassed about it because it has holes in it. And it shows where
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000 I'm lack of a day's at call and where I'm not prepared. It's like,
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000 okay, how many things are there like that? Well, there's a bunch of
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000 things. And they're all associated with how I procrastinated in the
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000 past. It's like, okay, what are we going to do to rectify that?
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000 So I'll say to people, why don't you update your CV? That's what
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000 we'll do first. Because if you're going to look for a different
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000 job, I'm not saying you're going to look for a different job. But if
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000 you're going to look for a different job, you're not going to
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000 unless your CV is updated. So why don't you go? Unless you can get a
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000 good recommendation from this boss that's a tyrant. And so that's right.
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000 There's you got to play the game. There's ten strategic
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000 actions that you're going to have to take in order to make
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000 yourself able to move laterally or up. And the truth is
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000 isn't going in and yelling at your boss and telling him everything
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000 you think about it. The truth is trying to figure out
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000 the very, very difficult process of how you put yourself in a better
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000 position. And that, like one of the things that's quite
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000 fun about this lecture tour is the letters that I receive or the
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000 stories that people tell me about switching jobs. Because they
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000 do realize that they're, and I often talk to people about
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000 consulting their resentment. Resentments are really useful
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000 emotion. Like it's really dangerous. It's one of the most
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000 dangerous psychological states I believe, but it's unbelievably
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000 useful because resentment usually only means one of two things.
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000 It either means quit whining and take it on because you're
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000 immature or it means you're allowing yourself to be taken
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000 advantage of and you have something to say or do. And so you
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000 want to sort out the first part and find out if you're just being
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000 immature and you can think that through and you can talk to people.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000 But if it's the second, it's like no, you've compromised
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000 yourself in a variety of ways and you have to figure out how to
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000 get out of that. And if you're resentful, that's evidence that
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000 you have in fact done that. Okay, so now that issue would be,
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000 well, how can you set your life up so that you can be without that
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000 resentment? And so that's when you start to develop a
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000 strategy for, you know, and there's actually an adventure
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000 in this too. I mean, I've had a number of clients who have been
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000 in jobs that they didn't like at all. And you know, they were
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000 tyrannized by someone, for example, and they were also working
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000 below their hypothetical level and we'd put together a plan.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000 It's like, okay, you're going to make three times as much money in five
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000 years. That's the plan. But like, that's not going to be simple.
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000 So there's education. You got to educate yourself. Maybe
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000 formally, because you've got holes. You got to fix up your
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000 resume. You've got to, you've got to overcome your fear of being
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000 interviewed. You have to start sending out like 50
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000 resumes a week on a regular basis and be prepared for a 99
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000 percent rejection rate. You, you're going to look for a different
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000 job. It's probably going to take six months to a year and almost all
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000 of that is going to be rejection. You've got to steal yourself from
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000 for that and prepare. And maybe this is going to be a three year
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000 process. It's no trivial thing. But, you know, it's almost
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000 inevitably, I can't remember a single example where the consequence
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000 of that very careful, detailed, strategic thinking wasn't
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000 massively substantive improvement in socioeconomic
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000 positioning and a great movement towards improving trajectory.
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000 And there's advantages even along the way, because even before that
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000 happens, the fact that you're taking genuine steps to put yourself in
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000 a better situation immediately starts to reduce your resentment
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000 even if it isn't having positive consequences to begin with.
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000 But you have to be realistic about it. It's like, look, it's going to
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000 be hard to update your CV because you're embarrassed about it and you
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000 should be. Right? So no wonder you're embarrassed about it. And then
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000 you're not very good at it. And there's holes in your story and you
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000 can be made nervous easily and you're not a very good advocate for
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000 yourself. There's a lot of improvement that needs to be done there.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000 And then you have to withstand the punishment of being constantly
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000 rejected when you apply for jobs because the baseline rejection rate,
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000 you know, for the typical job applicant is like 99%. It's like
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000 the rejection rate for everything. Is this going to work? No. But if you do it
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000 a hundred times, it might work once. And that's all you need. That's exactly
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000 it. You only need that once. And so the true there isn't to yell at your
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000 boss. The true there is to get your life together.
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000 Yeah. Play the game. You've got to play the game sometimes to
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000 get a strategic win to me. And that's another interesting thing here is
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000 that when you're in a relationship with a person, you don't want to
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000 get yourself to yourself. As I say, you don't want to surround
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000 yourself with yes men when you're in a leadership position. You also don't
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000 want to be your own personal yes man that just thinks you're great and
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000 agrees with everything that you're doing and won't tell yourself the
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000 hard truth. You know, you can't lie to yourself. Everything,
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000 you know, you can't lie to yourself. You can't lie to yourself.
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000 And that course why should I go to it. You know, it's like if you don't tell
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000 yourself the truth about what your situation is, it's going to be
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000 problematic. Just like if you don't have people on your team above
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000 you or below you in the chain of command that tell you the truth, that's
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000 going to be problematic as well. Which is something that's easier. So
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000 the playing the game thing. So are you thinking about that as a
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.000 person? You know, like because because it seems to be you're making
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000 two cases at the same time. Right. One is that you should obviously
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000 not undertake unethical actions. But then by the same token and
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000 you have to subordinate yourself to the realities of the situation.
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000 And I think that that's psychologically true because you're always in
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000 a situation where if you're in an organization, there's kind of an
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000 arbitrary and tyrannical aspect to it because it's never working
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000 perfectly. And then there's the positive aspect to it too. And so
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000 whenever you're doing a job, it could be that you're called upon to do
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000 things that, well, what would you say that are a necessary part of the
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000 operation of the machinery? I guess that would be particularly true in
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000 military situations. And let me give you a little just a broad
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000 example, right? You know, my personality and my reputation is that
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000 when I was in the military, it's like, oh, it's jockel. He's not going to
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000 you know, if someone tells him to do something, he doesn't want to do.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000 He's just going to say screw you. We're not doing it. We're doing it my
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000 way. I got the knock. But that was kind of the impression people would
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000 get from me. If they didn't know me from the outside, they think, oh,
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000 this guy's a knuckle dragger. He's just going to go forward. He's
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000 going to make things happen. And he's not going to listen to anyone else.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000 That was the impression from the outside. The reality is, hey, you
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000 can't do that. And be the reality is, what my actual idea, I'd have
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000 a young lieutenant would come to me and say, hey, you know, my boss is
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000 to tell me to do this, this, and this. And what they think I was going to
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000 say is like, bro, you don't do that. Stand up. You don't screw
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000 you. That doesn't make any sense. And they'd be, they'd get this
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000 look in the rise of surprise. When I'd say, oh, your boss wants
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000 to do that, do it. Do it well. Play the game. That's what I'm
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000 telling them to do is play the game because these things are
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000 meaningless. It's something, you know, something is pathetic.
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000 It's like, oh, you got to fill out a form of certain way.
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000 It's like, hey, shut up and play the game. Even my. So is that a
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000 matter of picking your battles? It certainly is a matter of picking
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000 your battles. And you, as that's part of strategy, right? Like
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000 everything can't be the war exactly. And it's exactly what it is.
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000 But, you know, a good example. And we wrote about it in
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000 that economy of leadership, which is, you know, my friend, my
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000 friend. So, guys, it works for me. Lave, Babin. We were getting told to do all this
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000 paperwork. You got to, you got fill out these forms. You got to, you got to
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000 have a serialized inventory of everything. It's got to be signed
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000 off this many days. We need to know the qualifications of each and
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000 every person. And when their qualifications come up, do and all
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000 these just ridiculous paperwork. And Lave came to me. And with
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000 the other cartoon commander, guy named Seth, they came to me and
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000 said, oh, man, this is bullshit. Why do we got to do all this
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000 paperwork? We're, we're here training for war. We're getting ready
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000 for war. Why we got to do this. And, you know, Lave will tell you,
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000 his expectation was that I was going to be like, you're right. I'm going
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000 to go to the commanding officer and tell him, screw this. We're not doing this
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000 stuff. This is crap. We're trying to prepare because we're in training
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000 getting ready to deploy to Iraq. This is crap. We're not doing this.
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000 And I looked at him and said, oh, we're doing all this paperwork.
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000 And not only are we going to do this paperwork, we're going to do it
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000 better than anyone else. And we're going to turn it in before it's
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000 even do. And you know, both him and Seth were kind of taking a
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000 back then the fact that I wasn't standing up and saying, we're not doing
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000 this. And then I explained to him, here's what we're doing. We're
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000 building a relationship with my commanding officer with our
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000 commanding officer. We're going to do these little things for him.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000 We're going to play the game because at some point two things
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000 are going to happen. Number one, we want to build trust with my
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000 boss. I want my boss to look at me. And when he tells me to do
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000 fill out paperwork, he knows it's going to be filled out. If he
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000 wants me to take down a building, he knows it's going to get
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000 taken out. If he wants me to execute up a large mission, I'll go
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000 and get it done. Where Bill, if I can't fill out paperwork
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000 correctly, how can he trust me to go on a real operation and have
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000 guys lives at risk? So the idea is like, hey, we're going to
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000 play the game. And I think sometimes people start to hear me.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000 They start to listen to me. And their first instinct is
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000 juggle wouldn't put up with this shit. And that's why
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000 these, you know, they'll hit me up the same thing. They'll
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000 write me an email, they'll write me a letter. And say, here's
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000 the situation I'm in. Whether it's a boss, whether it's a
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000 military, it's any of them. Whether it's their wife, like, like,
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000 my wife expects me not to train you into it. Something is stupid
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000 is that, like, my wife won't let me train. It's driving me crazy.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000 It's really starting to bother me. Why won't she? Well, what's
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000 the problem? Hey, have you taken her out for dinner? Do you
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000 know what I mean? Like play the damn game a little bit so that
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000 you can win strategic. And the same thing I think with your
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000 with the 12 rules, we're like, hey, tell the truth or at least
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000 don't lie. It's like, I get it. But there's a dichotomy in
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000 that statement. And that is if you run around telling the
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000 absolute truth to everyone, it's going to be like that Jim
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000 carry movie where he can't say anything that's not 100% true.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000 And he, you know, Gratwoman says, good morning. And he says,
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000 you look fat. You know, it's like, one of those, like, that's
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000 not good. And so you got to learn to play the game. And I
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000 guess again, go back to this book. It's like, that's a
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000 lot of stuff called to make in these situations. How much do you
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000 play the game? And there's an ethical line that you could
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000 cross at some point. If I become a capo, hey, you just, you
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000 played the game. And you went too far with it. And just like in
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000 obliterative situation, if I, if you're my boss and I'm just
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000 kissing your ass and doing whatever you said, my guys lose
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000 respect for me. Yeah, my team will lose respect for me. If you
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000 tell me to do something completely stupid. And I say, hey,
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000 guys, that's what the boss says. We're doing it. My guys will
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000 lose respect for me. And I won't be, I won't be able to
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000 execute missions the way I should. If when the pushback is
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000 proper, I say, hey, hey, boss, that doesn't make any sense.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000 We shouldn't do that. And I go to the guys and say, listen,
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000 I told, I talked to him. We're going to see what he says.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000 But trust me, if we have to do this, we'll figure out a way to
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000 make it work. Because if you're just the guy that's totally
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000 on board, if you're a brown nose or, right? Your
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000 guys will lose respect for you. 100% they will. They will
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000 lose respect for you. If you don't play the game at all, and you
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000 push back on everything that your boss says, you're going to,
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000 you're not going to hit fire. Yeah, that's another ethical
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000 situation. Like if my boss, if you're my boss and you tell me to do
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000 something, that's, I don't believe in, or it's like a bad plan.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000 And I, I draw the line in the sand and say, screw you Jordan.
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000 We're not doing it. You can fire me. You're like, okay, fine,
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000 you fire me. You get some, yes, man to come in. He takes
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000 my guys out on the mission and gets them all killed. He didn't
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000 mitigate the risk properly. It's better for me, ethically, to
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000 say, hey, look, Jordan, I don't agree with this plan. I really wish
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000 we could do it another way. Is there any way I can flex on it? You
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000 say, nope, you're doing it this way. It is better for me in many
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000 situations to say, okay, I got it. I'll make good indication of
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000 the complexity of the truth. I mean, one of the rules of thumb that
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000 I think is worth abiding by. And I guess this is something that
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000 makes me somewhat conservative in some ways is that he
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000 should do what everyone else does unless there's a very good
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000 reason not to. And I think that's the same idea that you're
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000 putting forward, which is that if you, if you do fight back against
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000 everything, then you're just to rebel without a cause, right? And
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000 you discredit yourself entirely. And if you accept everything,
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000 well, then you're not even there. And so there's some judicious
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000 analysis of the situation that helps you understand when the
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000 time for action is right. And most of the time, what you're
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000 doing in life is you're doing what other people do. And that's
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000 going along with the game. That's part of being socialized, but
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000 there's going to be times when the right thing to do is to
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000 break a rule and to do it very carefully. And so, and
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000 there's a scene, I think this is a new testament scene, but
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000 it might be in some of the apocryphal writing. I don't
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000 remember. So Christ is walking down the road on the sabbath.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000 And there's a ditch by the road, and it's very hot. And
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000 in the ditch, there's a hole. And in the hole, there's a sheep. And
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000 so the sheep is stuck in the hole. And this got shepherd is
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000 trying to get the sheep out of the hole. And Christ walks by and
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000 he says, if you don't understand what you're doing, you're a
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000 transgressor of the law and you're cursed. But if you do
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000 understand what you're doing, then you're blessed. So it's
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000 it's a perfect example of that, because it's like, if you're
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000 okay, now here's your situation, you're a shepherd and you're
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000 supposed to be taking care of that sheep, right? But it's the
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000 Sabbath day. So you're not supposed to be working. Now, if you have
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000 decided, you've thought this through. You think it's the Sabbath day.
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000 This is something that everybody needs because everybody needs to
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000 take a rest. And this is a rule I shouldn't break because
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000 everybody needs to take a rest or things degenerate. And I
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000 understand that, and I have a lot of respect for it. But I
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000 think that in this situation, it's still morally appropriate
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000 for me to break that rule in this slight way and get this
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000 sheep out of this hole, then, well, Christ's judgment was
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000 well, then you're exactly on the right track. But if you're doing it
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000 carelessly and stupidly, you're breaking that rule. Then you're a
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000 transgressor of the law and you're cursed. And I think that's
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000 exactly at the essence of what you're describing. It's like, you play
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000 by the rules. But then there's a meta rule, which is now and then
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000 you break the rules. And you do that very, very carefully because
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000 when you break the rules, you're breaking the rules. And the rules
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000 are what keep peace. They're what keep peace in order. And so you
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000 break them only in the service of a higher peace in order. And so
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000 that seems to be, and I think that's, you see this in, in, well,
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000 the sorts of stories that are influencing even the things that you're
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000 writing, like in the Harry Potter series, for example, Harry's
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000 friends and compatriots are quite disciplined, hermione in
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000 particular because she's an absolute master of her craft. But they
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000 still break rules when it's necessary, only when it's necessary. And
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000 that's what makes them more than the people who are just
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000 breaking rules all the time, the villains, so to speak. And
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000 also makes them more than the people that are just being good
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000 by being conformist. So you need that touch of rebelliousness,
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000 but it's got to be a flavoring and not the whole diet.
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000 I've actually talked about that on this podcast before. There's
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000 people in the military that they are like,
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000 metal rule followers. These are people that have been following
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000 rules of whole lives. And they've got perfect grades and they have
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000 the team. They're all these things. And they're going to
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000 make really good solid leaders, like they're going to be
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000 great leaders. But then there's this like one group above them.
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000 Yeah, have that same thing, but they also have that little
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000 bit of rebellion that they'll say, you know what, we're not
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000 going to win that. It doesn't make any sense. And that is
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000 really an important factor to have. But you know,
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000 that's one of the reasons I like this guy, Colonel David Hacker,
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000 this guy was the ultimate rule follower for his whole
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000 career. At the end, in Vietnam, he did interview and said,
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000 if we keep fighting this way, we're not going to win this
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.000 war. And they drove him out of the army. But that's the thing
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000 that because all along the way, there was other times where he
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000 do that. You know, his guy's going to get in take care of
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000 the guy. He'd break a rule and bring him beer or he'd do, you know,
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000 he'd do that along the way, not not so far outside the
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000 bonds that it would jeopardize his career. Because if he would do
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000 that, then you're not in charge of these guys anymore. Now,
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000 you're not going to have any impact. And so let's not get fired.
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000 Right. Right. Let's not get stupidly fired. Right. That's not
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000 an improvement. Exactly. Well, that's a,
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:49.000 awesome. I guess we, I know you got to go. So I can't
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000 think that we could get to a better little crust of the,
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000 our little capstone of the conversation than right there.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000 Thanks for coming on again. Hey, my pleasure, man.
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000 I'm glad we got a chance to talk about this book. This is a book
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000 that everybody should read. And, and you, I ordered the,
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000 well, I ordered a copy of yours with a Ford from Europe.
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000 You can't buy it from Amazon here. You can't buy it from Amazon.
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000 So it will be here when will it be? But I don't know.
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000 We're still negotiating the rights because the rights
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000 of the owners differ in North America. So that's the issue at the moment.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000 So okay. So I worked with an English publisher,
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000 Penguin in the UK that, that put out the,
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000 I think it's vantage books. If I remember correctly,
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000 I should just check and make sure that that's exactly right.
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000 Harper perennial modern classics.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000 That's not, that's not the British one.
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000 Well, that's, so that's not the British one.
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000 The British one hasn't gotten to my house.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000 Yeah. And so yeah, it has to be ordered.
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000 It has to be ordered through Amazon UK. And we're,
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000 we're working on a couple of things. Maybe to also maybe get the audio rights
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000 to the British version because I'd like to read it.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000 Nice. And that would be good. So the people could listen to it.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000 And so because it's, it's an absolutely necessary book.
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000 Yeah. And it's written actually, what's,
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000 I like it because it's written very conversation.
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000 I mean, he's cracking jokes in there.
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000 He's making, it's a brilliant piece of literature as well as,
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000 I mean, it's a very readable book, although it's unbelievably harsh
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000 and, and demanding and, and draining to read,
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000 but it's, it's brilliantly written. It's an unbelievably
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000 ingrossing read in the most horrible possible way.
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000 But, and, and it is, is the case that it's written at this white
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000 hot pace. You know, it's like talking to someone who's
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000 righteously, not self-righteously angry, but righteously angry
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000 for, for, for, for dozens of hours.
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000 And he just can't believe the levels of outrage that are,
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.000 that are being, that are being so incredibly well expressed
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000 and so effectively expressed. And, and, and again, I, I think it's also
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000 worth emphasizing the fact that, you know,
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000 social distance real contribution in many ways was to lay the
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000 catastrophe at the feet of the doctrine and not to say no.
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000 This, this wasn't an aberration because of Stellanar,
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000 you know, Lenin being the great leader and then Stellan being the monster
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000 because Lenin was plenty monster himself.
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000 And Stellan was the logical conclusion to Lenin not, not an aberration.
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000 But to say that, know, the horrors of what happened in the Soviet Union
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000 were, were implicit in the collectivist system,
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000 utopian system that gave rise to the philosophy to begin with,
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000 and that that's also an explanation why the same catastrophe
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000 is occurred wherever the Soviet system was applied everywhere else
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000 in the world. And something we really need to know.
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000 I mean, we fought a whole Cold War over that.
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000 We put damn near put the world to the torch because of this.
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000 And the idea that these ideas are, the fact that these ideas are
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000 creeping back is really, it's unbearable as far as I'm concerned.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000 So hopefully people read in this book and the, the re-release of this book
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000 with your forward will prevent that from happening.
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000 Well, at least it hopefully it will be a, a drop in a bucket that many other
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000 people can put drops into as well.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000 And so I'm hoping, I mean, I think the book has sold 15,000 copies
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000 since the beginning of November, which is pretty good for the re-issue and old classic.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000 But like it, it, it, it's required reading for an informed citizen of the 21st century.
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000 It's not optional. You need to know this material.
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000 You're not, you're not, you don't understand your position in society
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000 as an individual or a citizen without knowing this material.
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000 So it's like not knowing about what happened and not see Germany.
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000 It's not acceptable to not know.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000 So read the book.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000 Thanks for coming, Jordan.
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000 Really good to see you again, man.
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:38.000 Absolutely.
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000 Yeah, be better.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000 Appreciate it.
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:48.000 And with that Jordan Peterson has departed the recording studio.
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:57.000 And if you noticed that echo Charles was not present during the recording with Jordan Peterson,
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:05.000 but for the miracle of technology and recording echo has now joined us for the support.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000 You're a portion of this podcast.
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000 So good evening echo.
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000 Good evening.
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000 All right.
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:21.000 So if people listen to this podcast, which we appreciate and you want to support this podcast and support yourself,
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000 there are ways to do that echo can fill you in.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000 Sure.
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000 So first way is wine.
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000 You're doing you just because we're all doing you just to yes, it might sound a little bit repetitive,
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000 but to me, when you do just going to be doing it every single day, everything a week,
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000 at least even if you're doing the two times a week,
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000 three times I get it, either way you're going to need a ghee and a rash cart.
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000 So there is no question which kind of ghee you get.
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000 You get an origin ghee straight up made in America.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.000 I watched one of their videos yesterday and it's kind of an older one too,
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:10.000 but it made me like love origin even more because it's like you'll see you know the people that make up and all the ladies there and then pee like he has like longer hair and stuff like that.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000 It's like oh man, this kind of more of the beginnings of origin, you know, anyway, I thought it was good.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000 The last again made in America quality stuff for jujitsu.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:30.000 It's not like a blank ghee they get from over wherever some other place and then slap a embroidered patch on it.
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000 Let's say that.
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000 No, this is made for jujitsu in America.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000 Yeah, everything made in America from where we grow the material is grown in America,
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000 woven in America, woven in Maine as a matter of fact, custom woven by origin.
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000 We weave it up there and make the best guise in the world.
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.000 Also got some other stuff for you know, you got t-shirts, you can get sweatshirts and also coming in 2019.
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000 Jeans.
01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000 Yeah, jeans.
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000 Denham origin denim.
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000 I just call them jeans though.
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000 Yeah, yeah, I dig it.
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000 That starts to like, I don't know, move towards a fashion thing.
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000 What if you take denim denim denim?
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000 Well, I feel yeah, I dig it.
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000 I don't feel that material.
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000 Yeah, I feel like it's like origin denim they make it, you know.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000 Yeah, and then yeah, they make origin jeans for sure, but what if they make like a jean jacket?
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000 Like a denim jacket?
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000 No, I bet you're, but it's still be a jean jacket.
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000 That's true.
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000 I dig it.
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000 Cool.
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000 Either way, yeah, that's to, and I don't get excited for Jeans in general in life.
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000 Oh, don't.
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000 Yeah, like, you know, you see it on TV.
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000 I don't know.
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000 JCPenny has a sale.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000 You know, black thread or whatever.
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000 And you know, some jeans, I don't get excited.
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000 You probably, I'm assuming you don't either, maybe you do, I don't know, but when Pete posts
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000 little like videos of the close, you know, close up of the buttons, the jeans.
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000 Come on, Brown.
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000 That's, that's kind of exciting.
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000 I'm just saying either way.
01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000 Yeah.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000 Either way, the, also we have supplements too.
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000 Affirmative.
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000 Origin labs, which is expanding.
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000 Yes.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000 Yeah, yeah, we bought another building up there.
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000 Yeah.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000 But yeah, so they're making, we are making supplements.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000 Joint warfare, cruel oil, super cruel oil.
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000 By the way, discipline.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000 The try.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000 Fecta.
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000 Yeah.
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000 Yeah.
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000 My wife went on a trip.
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000 Didn't take joint warfare with her.
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000 Yeah.
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000 She's there for three, four days.
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000 Her knee starts bothering her.
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000 It bothers her the rest of the trip.
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000 She comes home.
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000 She goes back on joint warfare for three, four days.
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000 Knees fine again.
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000 Yeah.
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000 Same thing.
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000 That's just, that's just crazy.
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000 That's just a reality of it.
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000 So joint warfare, good for your joints, cruel oil.
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000 Also, good for your joints and good for your, good for your whole life system.
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000 Is that a thing?
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000 Life system?
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000 Life.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000 Yes.
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000 Okay.
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000 Well, it's good for that too.
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000 Discipline.
01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:04.000 When you need that focus and also discipline go, which is my pre cognitive enhancement tool.
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000 Go to.
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000 Go to.
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000 Yeah.
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000 Yeah.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000 Yeah.
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000 It's funny.
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000 Yeah.
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000 True.
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.000 By the way, in Hawaii, which is the reason why I didn't appear on this episode of the podcast.
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000 In Hawaii, so my father-in-law came.
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000 I told him the story about how he always talk about cruel oil.
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000 He's just sort of looking at me like whatever.
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000 And, you know, he used to tell me, oh yeah, cruel oil is good.
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000 Good for you all this stuff.
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000 And he said, not listen because, you know, he's more like a health dude.
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000 Yeah.
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000 And then when you started talking about it, like literally the day,
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000 you start talking about it, start taking it.
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000 And he was like, he didn't care.
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000 It kind of went right over his head and he was like, oh, so did you feel the difference?
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000 You know, like that's what he was concerned about.
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000 What do you mean care?
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000 That sounds like a respect.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:59.000 Also on top of that is Yam Mok, which is, which is Mok basically.
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000 That's what it is.
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000 It's, uh, it has protein in it.
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000 You mix it with milk.
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000 I got to make that statement.
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000 If you mix it with oil, you can mix it with almond milk.
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000 You can mix it with coconut milk.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000 You can mix it with regular cow milk.
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000 Sure.
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000 If you mix it with water, it's not, I'm not jumping up and down about it.
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000 Yeah.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000 And tell me, it's the most delicious thing in the world.
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000 If you mix it with milk, whole milk, especially, I will tell you, it's, it's a, it's a dessert.
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000 Straight up.
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000 It's a dessert that you will make you stronger.
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000 If so, you know, like hot cocoa, you ever make hot.
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000 Oh yeah.
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000 Okay.
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000 So I'm a fan.
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000 Put in water, right?
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000 Would you put in water and milk?
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000 That is not hot cocoa to me.
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000 Okay.
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000 I know we're talking about, you get the little, the little packet that you're supposed to mix with
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000 water.
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000 It's got the little crappy marshmallows in it.
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000 Yeah, that's not, that's a non-starter for me.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000 Yeah.
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000 So that's kind of the point there.
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:49.000 Yeah.
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000 It's sort of, you know, along the same lines.
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000 Yeah.
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000 It's cool.
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000 Yeah.
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000 It's cool.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000 It's good.
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000 You can do it.
01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000 Yep.
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000 And there's probably many, many, many people who do that.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000 You know, that's my opinion.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000 And by the way, you can't have hot chocolate milk.
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000 Yeah.
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000 It's good.
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000 It's right up there.
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000 Especially the word, kid one.
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000 Yeah.
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000 So you got Mint chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla, and the darkness.
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000 And then there's the, the warrior kid milk, which has a little bit less protein in it.
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000 Unless you double up on your scoops.
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000 Like I do for the strawberry because the strawberry is ridiculously good.
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:35.000 So give that a shot and by the way, all these things are available at originmain.com.
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000 And that's, that's the state of Maine.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000 I haven't dead lifted in a while.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000 So it was like, you know what, I'm going to test it.
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000 It can's right.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000 Dead lifted 8,000 pounds.
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000 Just like that.
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000 Just like that.
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000 No warm up even.
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000 No, you don't need it.
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000 You know, it's real.
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000 The warm up is drinking some joccoweight.
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000 Yeah.
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000 That is the warm up.
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000 And you're good.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000 8,000 pound deadlift.
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000 Yeah, that's the only product in the world.
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.000 In any capacity that guarantees 100% 8,000 pound deadlift minimum.
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000 Yeah.
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000 100%.
01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000 But yeah, so yeah, you get them one in the dry tea bags.
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000 If that's your thing, when you see.
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000 See.
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000 That's the word right?
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000 Steep.
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000 Steep.
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000 Okay.
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000 Boom.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000 If you like that gig.
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000 Hot, cold, whatever.
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000 And then the cans, which I recommend.
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000 I recommend the cans.
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000 Actually, I don't know if I'd recommend it, but I prefer the cans.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000 I like them both.
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000 Yeah.
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000 Depending on the scenario.
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000 There you go.
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000 Also, subscribe to the podcast on iTunes and Stitcher and Google Play, where we listen
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000 podcasts.
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000 There's a lot of new ones out there.
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000 There's apps.
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000 Yeah, for like this one.
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000 There's a lot of podcasts out there.
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000 Yeah.
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000 And listen to a bunch of them.
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000 Yeah.
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000 And one of them that you can also listen to.
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000 In addition to this one, if you want, you can check out the Warrior Kid podcast.
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000 That's basically directed at kids.
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.000 But I'll tell you that Uncle Jake has lessons for everyone in the podcast.
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000 And also, we got the YouTube channel.
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000 The YouTube channel where you can watch this podcast in its full length.
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000 And you can see what people look like if you don't know what Jordan B. Peterson looks like.
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000 If you don't know what echo Charles looks like or if you don't know what I look like,
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000 you can watch the YouTube channel.
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000 And you can see all of us.
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:16.000 If you've never seen Echo before, but you've only heard him, he probably doesn't look like what you think he looks like.
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000 Yeah.
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000 And I don't know if that's good or bad.
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000 I don't know if that's a backhanded compliment or a backhanded.
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000 Like the Roger to where he's statement about you, about your voice.
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000 Probably both, yeah.
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000 A little bit of both.
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:26.000 Yeah.
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000 But we'll suffice it to say that he's not what you expect when you see him in reality.
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000 And he also makes videos that are enhanced by imagery and music.
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000 Yeah.
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000 Exactly.
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000 And those are on there too.
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000 So you can check those out.
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000 You can subscribe to that YouTube channel.
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000 Also, we got the psychological warfare album.
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000 And that has tracks on it of.
01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:01.000 Well, there are of me telling you pragmatically why you should or should not do something like skip or work out.
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000 You should not skip or work out.
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000 Eat donuts.
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000 You should not eat donuts.
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000 So just some little things like that.
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000 You can check that out psychological warfare.
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000 Echo claims that it has 100% effectiveness.
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000 Yeah.
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000 100%.
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000 Should you go to the gym?
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000 Yes, you should.
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000 And if you listen to the track, you will go to the gym.
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000 Yeah.
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000 100% effectiveness.
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000 And actually, I mean, a lot of claims being made about effectiveness on this scenario.
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000 Well, man, hey, if it's real, it's real.
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000 You know, this double blind placebo tested.
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000 Well, you know, single blind maybe.
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000 Okay.
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000 I don't know what that means.
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000 But it's a sound official.
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:41.000 And it is official when, okay, and I kind of act right to psychologically analyze psychological warfare.
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000 Like why does it work every single time?
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000 And here's part of it.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000 Even you, you know how like when you get hypnotized,
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000 I'm not saying you're, we should have, I should have asked, I should have asked you
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000 order this question.
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000 Yeah.
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000 And to agree with this, I think.
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000 Okay.
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000 Well, maybe next time we're going to ask.
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000 Echo's bro theory on this.
01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.000 So, you know, like, um, being hypnotized, for example.
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000 Yeah.
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000 You've never been hypnotized.
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000 Yeah, I mean, either.
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000 So, but then again, it looks real when something happens to someone.
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000 You've never said, volunteered to not be hypnotized.
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000 Okay, me neither.
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000 Same thing.
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000 So hypnotism from what I understand is you have to like be, what he call
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000 a hypnotist.
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000 So, just open to it.
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000 Yeah.
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000 Open to it.
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:20.000 Yeah.
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000 So if you're a, um,
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000 suggestible person, that's like you have a certain kind of mind.
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000 And then on top of that, even more consciously, you have to
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000 volunteer to be hypnotized.
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000 Okay.
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000 I mean, I'm sure there's methods that you can sort of hypnotize someone
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000 without them knowing anything.
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000 But usually, I should even say I'm sure.
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000 But.
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000 Oh, yeah.
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000 It's like I'm the word for it.
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000 I wouldn't be surprised if you can hypnotize someone and then
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000 or not.
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000 Nonetheless, usually the hypnotic sequence goes through, hey, you volunteer.
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000 Like conscious, yeah, sure, I'll be hypnotizing you sit there and you're
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000 come to ten and you're closing your eyes and breathing.
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000 Anyway, so you consciously volunteer to be hypnotized.
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000 So you're open to being hypnotized and then blah, blah, blah.
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000 So psychological warfare is like, hey, you recognize, okay, I have this
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000 weakness.
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000 I'm about to skip this workout right now.
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000 You're basically saying, hey, I need to help.
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000 I need, you know, I need a little spot.
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000 You're volunteering for help.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000 I'm volunteering.
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000 Yeah, it's not like I'm like sitting in my room.
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000 It's not completely against your will.
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000 Exactly right.
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000 You're not just bustin' in the door, you know, insane.
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000 Hey, don't skip the workout.
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000 Meanwhile, in your mind, you already committed to skipping the
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000 way.
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000 It's different.
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000 You're like, you're not committed to skipping the workout.
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000 You just like are running the risk of skipping the work.
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000 You know, that weakness just creeps in and you're like, hey, I see you
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000 weakness.
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000 You're creeping in right now.
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000 I'm going to get, I'm basically, I'm going to tell Jockel that you're in here.
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000 And he's going to, you know, make you leave.
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000 And you play the track or whatever you have it on your phone, right?
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000 Because you have all your playlists on your phone.
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000 Anyway, you just play this psychological work for everyone.
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000 And you won't skip the workout, seem to say, because you don't want to skip the
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000 workout.
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000 No one wants to skip the workout.
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000 No one's thinking tomorrow.
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000 I can't wait to skip this workout.
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000 No, it's not like that, you know.
01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000 So it's, you come in and you just give that little nudge.
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000 That's why it works so good.
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000 It's true.
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000 It's absolutely true.
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000 I like it.
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000 And then the last psychological warfare, it's very effective.
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000 100%.
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:26.000 Also, while you're working out and if you're bored with your squats, the bench, get some kettle
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000 bells from on it in my opinion.
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000 On it.com slash jockel.
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000 Good stuff on there.
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000 Jump rope, battle ropes, kettle bells, clubs.
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:41.000 Be careful with the clubs.
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000 I was watching a video of a guy doing this club routine.
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000 I was like, dang, he took a lot of coordination.
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000 Like I'm looking at it and he had like the 40.
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000 I think like I did.
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000 I can't even imagine trying to do anything coordinated with the 40.
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000 Yes.
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000 Because I only have the 20.
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000 Yeah.
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000 And yeah, they come off real a lot more heavy than they look.
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000 Oh yeah, when you grab them at the end of the day, if it's 20 pounds, it's 20 pounds.
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000 No.
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000 There's no getting past that physically.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000 But when you pick it up, it's like, it's like, when you pick up your friend,
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000 you know, or your kid freaking in the way 70 pounds.
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000 It's like, I pick up 70 pounds with one hand.
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000 It's no problem when it's a dumbbell.
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000 Should I pick up your kid when there's 70 pounds with one hand?
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000 Can't do it.
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000 It's hard.
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000 Unless that's how these clubs are anyway.
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000 So watch out for those anyway.
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000 Go to onit.com slash jockel.
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000 You can get some really cool stuff on there.
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000 Really cool.
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000 Awesome.
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000 I got some books as well.
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000 First off, Mike in the dragons.
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000 I know Jordan and I talked about it a little bit today.
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000 And it was actually sold out for a little bit.
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000 It is now back in stock and have many, many, many,
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.000 thousands and thousands of copies that are inbound that are being printed.
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000 So if you want Mike in the dragons,
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000 go to Amazon in order.
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000 There's a little video on there.
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000 If you want to know what it's about that echo put together.
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000 It's a solid video from what I understand.
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000 The kids like to watch the video.
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000 It's like a little mini short.
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000 It's super fast.
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000 It's two minutes.
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000 Even in even my kids.
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000 So we're on, on, I watched the video.
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000 Yeah.
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000 If you are sending to me, I watched it like 14 times.
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000 Yeah.
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000 Because there's a lot of elements in it.
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000 A lot of things going on.
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000 Yeah.
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000 To my son.
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000 It's like a micro cartoon kind of.
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000 No, it's like a micro movie.
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000 Yeah.
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000 Well, it's a cartoon because there's a illustration.
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000 Yeah.
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000 But yeah, it's fun.
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000 We put on the TV when I was in Hawaii.
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000 You know, yeah, smart TV and there you can put YouTube on there.
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000 Oh, he's put on there.
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000 I put on the TV and my kids are all jumping up at that mic in the dragon's mouth.
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000 It's, you know, it's two minutes long.
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000 Yeah.
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000 No, I, you know, Jordan and I were talking about it.
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000 And, you know, obviously it's about facing your dragons.
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000 And there's obviously a metaphor there.
01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:00.000 And it's a real true pragmatic, simple to understand lessons of how to stand up and confront the
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.000 world and confront your fears that little kids will clearly and easily understand.
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000 And it'll even impact on anybody that reads it.
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000 So, Mike in the dragons, you can get that book.
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:22.000 On top of that, if you got kids, you can also get them the way of the warrior kid, which is another book about a young kid who's going through the problems that normal kids have.
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.000 And luckily, Uncle Jake, who was a seal in the seal team, shows up for the summer and helps them overcome those problems.
01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000 And then that series carries on another book called Mark's Mission.
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000 You can pick those two books up and give me that whatever kids you, those, those books, when you read those books,
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000 you'll wish you had that book when you were a kid.
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000 I know I absolutely wish I had that book when I was a kid.
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000 And I wish I had that book when my kids were kids.
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000 Yeah.
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000 Because it teaches them what it is they need to know, period.
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000 That's it.
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000 The discipline goes for you to feel manual.
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000 That book.
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000 That's how you do that's how you, it's just a field manual of how to be on the path of discipline.
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000 That's what it is.
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000 Look, the path of discipline is not easy.
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000 And there's no field manual for it.
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000 Oh, wait, there is now.
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000 But there didn't used to be.
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000 There didn't used to be.
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000 Look, I know discipline will help me.
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000 How do I get discipline?
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000 Where does discipline come from?
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000 None of that information was assembled anywhere.
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000 I made a field manual for it.
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000 It's called the discipline equals freedom.
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000 Field manual.
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000 It's not, it's not like any other book you can do.
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000 We other book you've ever seen or read period.
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000 It's not.
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000 But it's very popular.
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000 It's great.
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000 If you want, there's another thing.
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000 Kris, this one is a Christmas.
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000 This is a Christmas scenario.
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000 This is a Christmas scenario.
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.000 Give this book to somebody that needs help or needs to stay on the path or get on the path.
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000 This book will be extremely beneficial to them or people that are on the path.
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000 Getting after it.
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000 This won't keep them there.
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000 So that's the field manual.
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.24 If you want the audio version that it is not unautable,
01:54:55.24 --> 01:54:59.44 it's on iTunes and Amazon, Music and Google Play as an MP3.
01:54:59.44 --> 01:55:01.28 Also, the first book I wrote with my brother,
01:55:01.28 --> 01:55:03.12 Lave Babin, it's called Extreme Ownership,
01:55:03.12 --> 01:55:06.32 but that is a book taking the leadership lessons
01:55:06.32 --> 01:55:07.88 that we learned on the battlefield
01:55:07.88 --> 01:55:11.000 and translating them to your business and to your life.
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.28 And then the follow-up to that book
01:55:13.28 --> 01:55:15.08 is the dichotomy of leadership,
01:55:15.08 --> 01:55:18.36 which takes those lessons that we learned in combat
01:55:18.36 --> 01:55:23.36 and goes granular in teaching you how to balance
01:55:23.36 --> 01:55:26.72 the various dichotomies that you experience as a leader.
01:55:26.72 --> 01:55:29.68 So both, and all those books are available
01:55:29.68 --> 01:55:32.44 on Amazon or wherever else you might divide books.
01:55:32.44 --> 01:55:33.48 Also, we got Ashlan Front,
01:55:33.48 --> 01:55:36.28 which is my leadership consultancy.
01:55:37.24 --> 01:55:38.76 We solve problems through leadership.
01:55:38.76 --> 01:55:39.60 That's what we do.
01:55:39.60 --> 01:55:42.000 We work with companies all over the country
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.40 and internationally, if you want us to come
01:55:45.40 --> 01:55:50.04 and align the leadership at your company for victory,
01:55:50.04 --> 01:55:51.92 then go to Ashlan Front.com.
01:55:53.16 --> 01:55:57.32 We are doing, we have a leadership conference called The Muster.
01:55:57.32 --> 01:55:59.72 And we've done six monsters.
01:55:59.72 --> 01:56:02.64 We are doing three in 2019.
01:56:02.64 --> 01:56:04.40 We're doing one in Chicago in the spring.
01:56:04.40 --> 01:56:07.56 We're doing one in Denver in the fall
01:56:07.56 --> 01:56:11.52 and we're doing Sydney, Australia, in December.
01:56:11.52 --> 01:56:14.52 So if you want to come to one of those events,
01:56:14.52 --> 01:56:16.88 all the events that we've done have sold out,
01:56:16.88 --> 01:56:17.72 all of them.
01:56:17.72 --> 01:56:20.84 These are all absolutely going to sell out.
01:56:20.84 --> 01:56:23.84 So if you want to come, go to extremownership.com
01:56:23.84 --> 01:56:27.04 and register and as quick as you can.
01:56:27.04 --> 01:56:29.28 And then lastly, we have EF Overwatch.
01:56:29.28 --> 01:56:32.88 We are connecting special operations, veterans,
01:56:32.88 --> 01:56:37.88 and combat aviation veterans that are looking for work,
01:56:39.44 --> 01:56:42.000 that are proven leaders that are experienced leaders
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.60 and we're connecting them with companies out there
01:56:43.60 --> 01:56:46.48 in the civilian sector that need leaders.
01:56:46.48 --> 01:56:49.88 So if you want to comment that from either side,
01:56:49.88 --> 01:56:52.56 whether you're a vet or whether you're a company,
01:56:52.56 --> 01:56:56.84 go to EF Overwatch.com to get in the game.
01:56:56.84 --> 01:56:59.56 And if you have any more questions for us
01:56:59.56 --> 01:57:03.56 or answers for us, we are available on the interwebs
01:57:04.76 --> 01:57:09.76 on Twitter and on Instagram and on the Facebook.
01:57:09.76 --> 01:57:14.76 This book, Echoes, Adequatrals and I am at Jocca Willink
01:57:14.76 --> 01:57:19.76 and I started out this podcast today.
01:57:19.76 --> 01:57:22.64 Pretty heavy, pretty rough.
01:57:22.64 --> 01:57:26.08 And I think it's important to remember something
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:28.76 that I always refer back to and that is that Eval does
01:57:28.76 --> 01:57:30.80 exist in the world.
01:57:30.80 --> 01:57:32.56 It's out there.
01:57:32.56 --> 01:57:36.36 And with that, I'd like to thank all the military personnel
01:57:36.36 --> 01:57:40.16 throughout the globe that stand up to Eval
01:57:40.16 --> 01:57:42.44 in the world and thanks to police
01:57:42.44 --> 01:57:44.80 and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics
01:57:44.80 --> 01:57:47.52 and EMTs and correctional officers and border patrol
01:57:47.52 --> 01:57:50.40 and all the first responders that stand up
01:57:50.40 --> 01:57:53.16 and face Eval here at home
01:57:54.36 --> 01:57:56.44 and to everyone else out there.
01:57:59.16 --> 01:58:02.84 If things are tough and I know they get tough,
01:58:02.84 --> 01:58:07.84 life is hard, but there's still reason to be thankful.
01:58:09.72 --> 01:58:11.88 Be thankful you're not in a good log.
01:58:13.56 --> 01:58:15.76 Be thankful that you're not being tortured,
01:58:15.76 --> 01:58:17.60 be thankful that you have food to eat,
01:58:17.60 --> 01:58:20.16 be thankful you have a bed to sleep on.
01:58:21.84 --> 01:58:25.64 And then do your best to watch out for those
01:58:25.64 --> 01:58:30.24 little seeds of Eval that are planted around you
01:58:30.24 --> 01:58:35.24 and planted in you and keep those seeds of Eval in check
01:58:39.84 --> 01:58:44.08 by going out into the world and doing good.
01:58:44.08 --> 01:59:01.68 And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
