00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel podcast number 310 with Carrie Helton and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Carrie. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I went back to the living room and sat down on the couch.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Newspaper clippings, letters of recognition, and photos with important individuals were scattered across my coffee table.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The 47 years of my life were summarized in a pile of images and words. My life story stared me in the face.

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One photograph in particular caught my attention.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It was one in which I was holding a single tomato in one hand and a bucket full of tomatoes in the other.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I was wearing an old blue t-shirt and a pair of shoes that were ripped.

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
My abuelo, Jose, and my siblings stood beside me.

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
My abuelo posed with his straw hat.

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We were all wearing old dirty clothes.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The agricultural field seemed infinite in the background.

12
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The color of the shirt I was wearing in the photo was the exact color of the shirt I was wearing as I gazed at the picture at that moment.

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I had to smile thinking about how things in life came full circle.

14
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was now wearing a blue NASA polo shirt and not an old blue t-shirt.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It dawned on me that there is no secret formula or magic for making dreams come true.

16
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The only way to make a dream come true is to have the passion, the work ethic, and the foundation of a good education

17
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to help go from one step to the next, while pushing aside the obstacles in life.

18
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That right there is an excerpt from a book.

19
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The book is called Reaching For The Stars.

20
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It was written by a gentleman by the name of Jose Hernandez, who has had an incredible voyage that led him from those fields.

21
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Picking tomatoes as a child, an out in central California, and doing that to help pay the bills for his family.

22
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And that journey took him all the way to man's final frontier, space aboard the space shuttle as an astronaut.

23
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And it is an honor to have Jose with us here tonight to share his story with us and also share some of the lessons that he learned along the way.

24
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's great honor. Jose, thank you for joining us.

25
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Thank you for inviting me. It's pleasure to be here.

26
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's a wild story, and I kind of jumped to the end there, the voyage that you've been on the whole way, and the perseverance that you've shown.

27
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
There's an incredible story.

28
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Yes, I think it just epitomizes the American story.

29
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
You know, if what's possible here in this great country of ours, of being able to reach the American dream, if you're willing to work for it.

30
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You know, I always tell folks when I give my talks, I say, look, I'm a religious man. I'm a Catholic man, but I also know nothing's going to fall from the sky for me.

31
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Anything I want in this world of ours, you've got to work for it. And my father taught me that at a very young age, and you saw that, fact that working with my grandfather in the fields, picking tomatoes, I mean, they taught us that work ethic.

32
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And they said, nothing's going to come for free in this world. And I certainly believe it, and I just developed a great work ethic as a result.

33
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Incredible. Well, you know, if we're going to go through the story, we might as well go through the story. Again, the book is called reaching for the stars.

34
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And as I read this story, look, folks, I can't read them. I'm not going to read the whole book. That's not where we're here for, but you've got to get the book to get all the details. The level of detail that gives incredible.

35
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's a, there's funny parts in the book, there's sad parts in the book.

36
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:33.000
There's triumphant parts in the book, and there's failure in the book. So it covers the full spectrum of human emotions. And so if you, if you want to hear the full story, you got to get the book again. It's called reaching for the stars.

37
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So I'm going to jump ahead a little bit. Here we go.

38
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I was born August 7, 1962 in French Camp, California. At that time, my family lived in Stockton, California.

39
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That is where the story of my life begins. I grew up surrounded by the love of my family and the many hardships that come along with being part of a migrant family.

40
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
My memory begins at the age of five precisely as I, the time I started school.

41
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I remember boarding this bus to school when we were living out in the countryside near the city of Modesto.

42
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
The school located in the small town of Salida, my saying that right, Salida, Salida.

43
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Seemed very large and was filled with students who seemed a lot bigger and older than me. The classrooms were decorated and filled with rows of shiny new desks.

44
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The desks had built in compartments that allowed us to store pencils, crayons and papers. I could not believe I was assigned my own beautiful desk.

45
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:40.000
The phrases of gratitude were silently running through my head, but all I could do is stare at the blackboard because I did not speak the language. I tried to figure out the meaning of what was written down and drawn in color chalk.

46
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I never dared to raise my hand to ask a question, let alone answer one.

47
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I also never fully participated in any of the classroom kindergarten activities like singing, storytelling or playing board games.

48
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It came as no surprise that my kindergarten teacher, whom I called La Mastra, spoke only English.

49
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
She was not sure I understood everything that was being taught, much less being said.

50
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I remained silent with the hope of being invisible to everyone.

51
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So, that's what a kick's off him. Going into school, no English.

52
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And the teachers, they're just teaching an English and that's that. Exactly.

53
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
In those days, there weren't any programs like English as a second language where they put you and they try to beef up your English skills.

54
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
They just threw you in the general population and you sang or so I am young.

55
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And that's the way it was.

56
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Proponents that say, that's the way it should be and there's others that say, no, we need an English a second language as a program to help the weaker students.

57
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And so, but in that particular case, I had no choice. I was just thrown in there.

58
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
What do you think? What's the way to do it?

59
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Just straight immersion? What's your opinion?

60
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
When I went to college, I took Spanish.

61
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yes.

62
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Three semesters of Spanish.

63
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And I had a friend that's Mexican that I took Spanish with and he grew up speaking Spanish.

64
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I got better grades than him in Spanish class and I could, I could barely, you know, I'd go to a Mexican restaurant.

65
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I couldn't, I was worthless.

66
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I was worthless. It's speaking.

67
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
But I learned like the rules.

68
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Yes, exactly.

69
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Exactly.

70
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
But I remember sometimes the teachers, they had the thought.

71
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
The professors had the thought that you, this is immersion.

72
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And so they wouldn't speak to you in any English at all.

73
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And I thought to myself, sometimes I, I thought to myself, I really wish I, you would answer this question for me.

74
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Because I don't know, I'm not figuring this out.

75
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I don't know what do you think?

76
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I think it should be a hybrid.

77
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Because I think there's students that will do well under any immersion program.

78
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And then there's other students that really need that extra help so that they can get to that next level.

79
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I'll tell you, you know, my first experience in kindergarten was,

80
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
was just as you described it there.

81
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But it actually occurred in three different places.

82
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Because, you know, my story begins well before I was even born.

83
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
My parents are from the central state of Metrocán in Mexico.

84
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And my father at the young age of 15 out of economic necessity

85
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
was a country where my family of 12 is one of the oldest boys.

86
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000
He had to come and work in California as in, in, in, in, in what he knew, which was agriculture.

87
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And he quickly set up a routine, which was common amongst folks from Metrocán,

88
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
which was, you would spend two months in southern California on terryl,

89
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
chino area picking strawberries.

90
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Then two, and then you will move up to Selena's and you pick strawberries and lettuce.

91
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And then you will go up to the Stockton Modesto area for five months.

92
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
There you start off with the cucumbers, then the cherries, then, then you got onions and peaches,

93
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and you, and, and tomatoes, and then you end the harvest with the great harvest.

94
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And then he will go back home for three months and cool his heels.

95
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well, when he was 19, he met my mother from the same hometown.

96
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They got married.

97
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And she was the, at the old ripe age of 14, you know, who should have been crime these days now, right?

98
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But, but they got married and luckily my dad,

99
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
incorporate my mom into this nomadic lifestyle.

100
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And of course, kids come along during the, um, marriage, right?

101
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And there's four of us. I'm the youngest of four.

102
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And where were you were born?

103
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Did take it a what month he were born in?

104
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
See, I was born in August.

105
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Okay, so you were American there.

106
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Yes, yes, the last stop I was out and my brother was born in September.

107
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Then I got a brother and sister born in December and they were born in Mexico.

108
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Well, getting back to now imagine we were living this nomadic lifestyle as a kid

109
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and Spanish is the only language I knew how to speak.

110
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Right.

111
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Now imagine the kindergarten.

112
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
My first kindergarten is going to, um, in the Ontario, Chino area, you know,

113
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
they, they, they stick me in there.

114
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Just as I learned where the bathrooms at, they take me to Salinas and just as learn where those,

115
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
bathrooms are at, I'm down to my third kindergarten teacher in Stockton.

116
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And, uh, and so you could imagine it wasn't a very conducive environment to, uh, to learn.

117
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And that's, that's eventually why your dad decided to stay up in America, right?

118
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Yes, yes, is my fact, um, in the second, um, and remember,

119
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
my me to, to say some about my teacher at the end when we blast off and all that,

120
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I always forget to tell that part of the story, which is pretty cool.

121
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But, but, but, uh, it wasn't until I was in the second grade in the second grade,

122
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
we were in our last stop in Stockton.

123
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And my dad gets up in the morning about a week, a week before, um, a week before we go to Mexico.

124
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
He makes the, what we call the grananuncio, the big announcement.

125
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And the big announcement was he would get up and say, kids,

126
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
we're going to Mexico next week, talk to your teachers and get three months worth of homework.

127
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Why three months?

128
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Because that's what we stayed over there.

129
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And my father, my parents didn't put us in school over there because, uh,

130
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
uh, Christmas vacation came along in all that and they said, no, no, no, no, no, no.

131
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You guys are going to self study.

132
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And so my mom would wake us up every morning in my grandma's house.

133
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Uh, we would go to the kitchen.

134
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
They would give us a cup of hot chocolate piece of French bread.

135
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
From eight in the morning, the 12 all four of us will be doing our homework.

136
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Yeah, the homework was stained of chocolate, but we got it done.

137
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And, uh, and, and so, in the second grade,

138
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
when he told us to do that, to get the homework,

139
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I went to my second grade teacher, Miss Young.

140
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And, uh, man, she was a, you know, second grade.

141
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Who's your first crush, you know?

142
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Yeah, guilty as charge, you know,

143
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Do you remind me it was me and Miss Young, you know?

144
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And, and, and, and, and I remember, um, she was tall, young, uh,

145
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Asian and black, long black hair, and tall, relatively to a second grade.

146
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Now I see her supporting the short, but she was tall back then.

147
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And, um, and I asked her for for the, for the, for my homework.

148
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And she looked at me with this frustrated look and said,

149
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
you tell your parents I'm going to come home and talk to them.

150
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And that's when Miss Young came and convinced my parents that

151
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
we needed to stay in one place.

152
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And, uh, and, and that's what sort of changed the whole dynamics,

153
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the whole direction of our family.

154
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And I love to tell the story to educators, because, uh, you know,

155
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I tell them, hey, I know you feel like you're not making a difference.

156
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Uh, but let me tell you, one little thing my teacher did

157
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that changed the trajectory of a whole family.

158
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And I tell him this nice story about Miss Young.

159
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And she actually came to your house to meet your parents.

160
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
She told them.

161
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Yes, um, my mom, uh, when she, when she told me that she was going to come

162
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and talk to them that evening, I went running home.

163
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I didn't even wait for my siblings, because they were in elementary school too.

164
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I went running home, because I, you know, I felt like Paul Riviera, right?

165
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Teachers got me teachers coming, you know, with the lamps, you know?

166
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And, uh, and, and, and I tell my dad and my mom about,

167
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and my mom, of course, like any Latina woman,

168
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
instead of, uh, worrying about, because my dad first, when I told him the teacher

169
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
was coming, he started taking off his belt, because he said, you must have did something

170
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
bad.

171
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And I kind of backtrack and convince him, I had to do with our trip to Mexico.

172
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And my mom, different priority, she actually said, we have to sweep and

173
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
mop and make a nice dinner, uh, because the teachers coming.

174
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And so, yeah, they pulled out all the bells and whistles when the teacher came.

175
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I loved when visitors came to our house, because, you know,

176
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
we lived a very humble life.

177
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I never, ever went to bed hungry.

178
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Thanks to my parents hard work, but Malta, you man, we had our fair share of beans and rice and tortillas and salsa.

179
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But when visitors came, the protein magically appeared in a form of nice things.

180
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
They, you know, chicken or a pork shop.

181
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And I remember I used to get so happy when my dad would say, hey,

182
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
you know, your uncle is coming or your grandpa is coming.

183
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Translation, we're going to have meat on the table.

184
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
But, but yes, she actually came and she convinced.

185
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And she told a beautiful story to my dad to convince him, because my dad is a very,

186
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
well, well, well, how should I put it?

187
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
A very proud man.

188
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And, um, and I remember after dinner, they went to the small living room.

189
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And, um, and, um, and my dad and Miss Young,

190
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
thank my mom for the dinner after she brought coffee.

191
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And she basically said, I didn't really come here to, uh, to have dinner,

192
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
but thank you very much.

193
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I really came to talk to you about the education process of your four kids.

194
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And I remember the story, because my dad and mom did not speak English at the time.

195
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Miss Young didn't speak Spanish, so I was the official translator since she was my teacher.

196
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And, and, and, and when she said that that she was here, uh, to talk about the education process of the four kids.

197
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
My dad immediately cut uncomfortable, because I know what's going to my dad's mind.

198
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
He was saying, it's not a complaint of one kid.

199
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
It's a complaint of four kids, you know.

200
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And Miss Young said, saw how uncomfortable she got.

201
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And she said, no, it doesn't, it's quite the contrary,

202
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and I said, you know, it has to do the fact that I've had the privilege of having your four kids in my class.

203
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And let me tell you, they all love school.

204
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
They're good students.

205
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I said, but this nomadic lifestyle that you're living,

206
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
uh, is not helping them.

207
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And my dad and Emily stops Miss Young says, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

208
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So it's, it's true that, uh,

209
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
my wife and I only have a third grade elementary education.

210
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
We're farm workers.

211
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And, um, and while my kids help me in the weekends, in the fields,

212
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and seven days a week during the summer,

213
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
whenever they're school, I said, they're either in school or they're doing their homework,

214
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
they're self-studying, as we take serious their education.

215
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And Miss Young said, yes, but you move from,

216
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
to three different towns, three different school districts.

217
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
You know what my dad's response was?

218
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
He said, yes, but we move on Saturday.

219
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
We was just true.

220
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
We finished school on a Friday Monday.

221
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
We were in the new town, new school district,

222
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and we were in school.

223
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So we didn't miss a day of school. He was right about that.

224
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And then Miss Young was, yes, but then you go to Mexico for three months.

225
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And my dad says, yes, but they take your homework.

226
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So in my dad's eyes, he was meeting his obligation of giving us an education.

227
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
He didn't realize that moving us around was detrimental to the process,

228
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
the educational process.

229
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And Miss Young was clearly frustrated.

230
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And then I watched her closely, and then she kind of smiles.

231
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Almost as she got an idea.

232
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And, you know, she must have studied psychology because she,

233
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
she was brilliant at it.

234
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
The first thing she does is she caters to make a decision.

235
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
She caters to my dad's ego.

236
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
She looks at Mr. Hernandez and says, Mr. Hernandez,

237
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
your kids tell me that you have many years experience in agriculture.

238
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Said, man, I think you can be considered an expert on agriculture issues.

239
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Oh, man, you didn't have to tell that to my dad.

240
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
My dad's touch pulling up his collar.

241
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So, oh, yeah, I'm not sure I could be considered an expert,

242
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
but I do know a thing or two about points.

243
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Can I help you?

244
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And, man, Miss Young, let's out of bigger shoes.

245
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
She took the baby.

246
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
He took the baby.

247
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
He took the baby.

248
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And, and Miss Young said, well, yes, as a matter of fact, you can.

249
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
She said, you know, I'm going to give you a problem.

250
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And you can tell me what happens because I think that's going to help me.

251
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
But I think it's also going to help you.

252
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And my dad says, sure, that's what's the problem.

253
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
She goes and she says, imagine I give you a small amount of money.

254
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Small tree in that potted plant.

255
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I'm going to give it to you.

256
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
It's a fruit tree.

257
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I'm a dad says, well, thank you.

258
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
She says, now, I want you to find the best ground fertile ground

259
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
dig a hole in your planet.

260
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And you take good care of it like the expert that you are.

261
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
You're going to fertilize it, water it, everything.

262
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
You take good care of it.

263
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
My dad says, I can do that for you, Miss Young.

264
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Absolutely.

265
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Then she looks at him says, three months later, I want you to find another piece of

266
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
ground equally as good.

267
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Dig a hole, transplant that tree there.

268
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Keep taking care of him.

269
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
My dad, if puzzle looked now, says, okay.

270
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And then Miss Young grew up very quickly says, and then another three months,

271
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
what's more every three months, I want you to transplant that tree.

272
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Mr. Hernandez, but you're going to take good care of it.

273
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
It's going to get all the water, all the fertilizer, all the nutrients and needs

274
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
because you're the expert.

275
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
You're going to take good care of it.

276
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Then she looks great in the eye to him and says, now, you tell me what happens

277
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
in the long run to that tree.

278
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Oh, my dad starts thinking, start coming is must actually like he likes to.

279
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
When he's very offensive, and says, well, Miss Young, that's very easy.

280
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:07.000
He says, the tree's not going to die, but you're going to stun its growth because it's going to be weak.

281
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And if it's a fruit tree, it probably won't even bear fruit.

282
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Why?

283
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Let me tell you why.

284
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
So a tree needs to be in one place so the roots can grow deep.

285
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And the branch even raises up his hands.

286
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
So the branch is going to grow big and tall.

287
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And he's doing this and you can count the two seconds.

288
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Big and tall.

289
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And then you can see his face or his forehead.

290
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
He got it.

291
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I mean, he got it.

292
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
It took him two seconds, but he got it because he sheepishly kind of put his hand down.

293
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And I got it because my dad's very proud, but I got to give him credit that day.

294
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Because he could have got mad or denial or whatever.

295
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
But he actually just looked at Miss Young and said,

296
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
is that what you mean?

297
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And Miss Young said, that's exactly what I mean.

298
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I think my job is done here and she excused herself and she went off.

299
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
And I'll tell you, that year we still went to Mexico,

300
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
but on the way back we used to go by car and from Stockton to Metrocon is almost a three-day trip.

301
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
On the way back that year, we didn't stop in Ontario,

302
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
we kept driving north. We didn't stop in Central California,

303
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Salinas, we kept driving north and went straight to Stockton.

304
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
From then on, that was our first and only stop.

305
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And then our trips back to Mexico, we still went every year,

306
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
but our trips to Mexico shrank from three months to three weeks

307
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
centered around Christmas vacation and all of a sudden our education started to get traction.

308
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And why did it happen? All because the visit of one teacher,

309
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
and this is why I always love telling this story to educators.

310
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I said, you just never know what little sea you're going to plant that's going to give fruit

311
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
to no pun intended in terms of helping kids.

312
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
So whenever you're down and out, think of this story.

313
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Because I'm sure there's something you've done in your career that's affected a kid.

314
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
You may not know about it, but I'm sure you've done positive

315
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
has helped a family.

316
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Yeah, no doubt about it. That's an awesome story.

317
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I know there's another thing you mentioned in here that had an impact on you.

318
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I'm going to the book. It says,

319
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Star Trek was my favorite show growing up.

320
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
My brother Chava had a toy model of the USS Enterprise Space Ship from the show,

321
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
which was my favorite toy to borrow and play with for hours and hours.

322
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
In Stockton, we spent a majority of the year.

323
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
In California, we lived in a small rented three bedroom house located on the east side of town.

324
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
It was an old house made a wood with a tile roof and had a small bathroom around dining table

325
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
and a living room with old furniture.

326
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Although the kitchen was small, it was always stocked with the necessities

327
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
from making a delicious Mexican meal tortillas, tomatoes, peppers and onions,

328
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
the quarto or bedroom I shared with Chava and Gil had only two beds a desk and a dresser.

329
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Our furniture was rather austere and most of the pieces were second hand.

330
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
The most luxurious item my family owned was the black and white television set.

331
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
And even that was old by normal standards.

332
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
The street we lived on reflected the humbleness of its residents.

333
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
My family included with a few exceptions.

334
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
My neighbors made a living working either in the fields or the canaries.

335
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
The canaries, process, vegetables and fruits brought directly from the fields.

336
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
This is where the tomatoes are packaged after being turned into ketchup or paste.

337
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And where the fruits are canned to become fruit cocktail.

338
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I came from a world bordered by limitations primarily financial ones.

339
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Fortunately, as a child I occupied myself with something that did not require any dinner.

340
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Because it was free.

341
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
No one knew about my special hobby because I did not talk about it.

342
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Fueled by the scenes of Star Trek, I spent my time looking up at the sky,

343
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
especially at night.

344
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
At the time I did not know exactly what it meant.

345
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I realized that I was a little bit more pessimmerized me.

346
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
But there was something up in the sky that fascinated me.

347
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I spent hours in my bedroom gazing through the window and staring up at the stars.

348
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I stared at the stars thinking those stars over there are twinkling.

349
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And that one over there is not.

350
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Those over there look yellow while those over there look blue.

351
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
All of them appear to be the same, but they all are so different.

352
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So even from a young age, you were fascinated by what you were seeing up in space.

353
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Yes, and what really helped was the fact that aside from watching the first run Star Trek series in William Chattner,

354
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
who, by the way, recently became a real astronaut, right?

355
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
He went up into space.

356
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
That's really just across the carmen line.

357
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
So he became an astronaut.

358
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
I got his wings.

359
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
But what really inspired me was after watching things like Star Trek,

360
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
our loss in space and those type of programs.

361
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
When we used to go out to the fields, it used to be in the early dawn.

362
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
It was still dark outside.

363
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
And so we would go out to the fields away from the light pollution.

364
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And so you're in pitch dark still.

365
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
The sun hasn't come up.

366
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
It still needs 20, 30 minutes for it to come up.

367
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I could go outside and you would go up and you let your eyes adapt.

368
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
And you start gazing.

369
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
You can see the stars so clearly.

370
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And even clouds, like the milk, you wait those type of things.

371
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
You can make out that it was so clear.

372
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And those are the things that really grab my imagination.

373
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And I say, you know, one day I'm going to be after.

374
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
You have a good section here.

375
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
You learned just an awesome lesson from your dad.

376
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
You say this as I grew older.

377
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I would learn the manus or bad habits of the other workers.

378
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
This included bending the bottom of their metal buckets inward to create less volume.

379
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And thus appear to fill each bucket even more quickly.

380
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
That's where the cucumbers is.

381
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I would also learn how to swiftly re-seat a bucket of pepinos to make it look more full when it was really not.

382
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
All tricks of the trade I told myself.

383
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
This was how we Hernandas kids spent our weekends and summers.

384
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
We knew that it was our response.

385
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
We knew that it was our responsibility to do.

386
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And there was no way of getting around that.

387
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Every morning spent in the field to promise us the same routine of going to and fro.

388
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Picking fruits or vegetables from the ground as the rays of the hot sun hit our backs.

389
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
During one Saturday in particular, I fell over accidentally stepping on a yellow overgrown pepino that was rotten.

390
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I remember it's rotten stench as I threw down my bucket standing there thinking,

391
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I'm all covered in mud. I stink, I'm tired, and I'm sunburned.

392
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
My siblings continue working alongside my parents, but I'm not going to anymore.

393
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I want to go home, watch TV and play.

394
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I decided to quit.

395
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
I went to my father and pulled on his pant leg to tell him,

396
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Dad, I'm tired, I want to go home.

397
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
When he heard when I told him he leaned down,

398
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
took a hold of both my shoulders and with a surprise look on his face,

399
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
asked, what's wrong?

400
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
It's something happened, are you okay?

401
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Look at me, I'm dirty, I fell in the mud, I want to leave.

402
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Plus, I've already made $10 for the day I cried to him.

403
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
The day's almost over he said, just keep on working, I don't want to.

404
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Fine, he said.

405
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Take a good look at yourself.

406
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
You don't want to see, you don't like what you see right now.

407
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
You don't like working in the fields in the hot sun or getting dirty, am I right?

408
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Well, if you quit now, you'll be creating a pattern that is easy to conform to.

409
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
If you don't work hard in school or in life, this will be your future.

410
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Is that what you want?

411
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
No, I answered him.

412
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Well, then don't settle for $10.

413
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
The day is almost over, get back to work, he ordered,

414
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
with just the right balance of authority and love and his version of tough love.

415
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
What my father told me that day in the fields changed the trajectory of my life.

416
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
It turned into the speech that transcended the end of a long day of working in the field.

417
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
We would hear it when all four of us sat in the back seat of our ramshackle car.

418
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Father would turn around to look at us before he would turn on the engine.

419
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
And he would say, so how do you guys feel right now?

420
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
We, of course, tired, sweaty, covered with mud, and we would answer accordingly.

421
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Good, he would say, because you, kids, have the privilege of living your future right now.

422
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Living our future right now, we would ask you, isly.

423
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Yes, he would say, I'm not going to force you to go to school or get good grades.

424
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
But if you don't, this is the type of job you'll have for the rest of your life.

425
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
This is the future that awaits you.

426
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
So if you want to quit school right now, no problem.

427
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
I invite you to start coming to work with me every day as of tomorrow.

428
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
My father's words made me realize that if I continued going to school,

429
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I could do whatever it was I wanted to do in life.

430
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
If I studied hard, I might one day make enough money, so my parents would no longer have to work in the fields.

431
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:28.000
To this day, I believe my father's words changed the course of my destiny, and I am so grateful to him for that.

432
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I sometimes talk about the fact that, I think one of the hardest things for kids to do is connect what they're doing right now to their future.

433
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I don't understand how hard they work right now is going to put them wherever they end up in the future.

434
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
And your dad made that connection loud and clear for you all did me exactly.

435
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
And he put it very well in saying you have the privilege because he said, you know, your neighbors, you know,

436
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
aren't working in the fields during the summer.

437
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
They're off goofing off and having fun.

438
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Your friends, they're in the neighborhood, they're not doing that, but you are.

439
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
So they don't know what their future is like.

440
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
So they're happy go like a carefree and they don't care.

441
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
They'll least squat about going to school.

442
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
But you know what your future is at. Here it is. You're living it.

443
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
So you want to do this the rest of your life.

444
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And I said, man, I don't want this.

445
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
I think I'm going to do well in school because I want something better than this.

446
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
And so, so it was a hard lesson.

447
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I know my kid with one of my kids was telling me the other day, we were walking through our town.

448
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And there was, you know, like a some homeless drug addicts, clearly on drugs, clearly just in a totally bad position in life.

449
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And they were telling me that when they were little, I walked by those people and say, that's what drugs do to you.

450
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And they were happy for that.

451
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
It's to say, I have the same tip as the type of approach your dad took.

452
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Exactly.

453
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Exactly.

454
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Left an impression on you.

455
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Um, so now you, I'm going to fast forward a little bit again.

456
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
You got to get the book to get the whole story. I'm skipping giant swaths of the book.

457
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
But, um, going fast forward a little bit here.

458
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Things at school continue to get better.

459
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Making friends became easier and speaking in glaze became less of a challenge as time passed.

460
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I did not consider myself fluent in the language until the age of 12 on the other hand, mathematics never gave me any problems.

461
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
I had my routine down and I followed it strictly as a soldier of wood.

462
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Every day after school I would do my homework, watch TV and then play outside the only things that differ from day to day with the questions that invaded my mind.

463
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
I made it my personal mission to track down the answers to every single query that palped into my thoughts,

464
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
constantly pursuing knowledge while satisfying my curiosity.

465
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
You were in the school, huh?

466
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Yeah, you know what really helped was, um, my father, you know, in those days they, um,

467
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
they had the world book in psychopedia and they used to have salesmen that would come to your house and they sell them to you.

468
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And I remember my dad, they came one day and it was expensive.

469
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
It wasn't, it was like 300 back then.

470
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
It was like 300, some odd dollars or something.

471
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
You know, my parents didn't have that kind of money.

472
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
But they bought the whole A through Z selection.

473
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
So I didn't just get like A through B.

474
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I mean, exactly. They bought the whole thing and man, whenever I needed to find something out,

475
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
it's the good old world book in psychopedia.

476
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
I would read it.

477
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
I would even go to bathroom and take, you know, A with me or B or whatever, you know,

478
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
thumb through it as you do your business.

479
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
But, but that, you know, those little things that my father did really, really helped that.

480
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Where do you think your father, obviously, he had this incredible grasp on the fact of how important education was?

481
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Where do you get that from?

482
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I think he got it from the fact that he had been working in the fields himself since he was 15.

483
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
He came even before then back at home he used to work in the fields.

484
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
And I think he realized he says, I don't want to put my kids through this.

485
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And when he saw when he came to the states, you know, he saw what people that had an education,

486
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
what kind of jobs they have and that's what he kind of, you know, won it us.

487
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
My mother, you know, both my father and my mother had they,

488
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
if they had gotten an education, I think they would have been well-known psychologists.

489
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Because they were like expert, expert motivators.

490
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
My mother, I remember every Friday we used to, we used to cash,

491
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
we used to get paid in the fields, they gave you cheques, paper cheques back then.

492
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
And so on Friday after work, we would go directly to a gas station,

493
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Chevron gas station and it had a little mini-mart.

494
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
My siblings would go inside while my dad gasped up and they would buy chips and so on.

495
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:13.000
So does and I would say, hey, get me one, too, because my mom would then drag me like across the street to Bank of America to cash the cheques.

496
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And I remember we were standing there inside the bank.

497
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
It was about four in the afternoon, hot summer day, about over a hundred outside.

498
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And, you know, you're going to a bank nice and cool right in that air conditioning.

499
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000
And so we're standing there in line and I'm mining my own business and joining the cool weather there.

500
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
And then I feel it tug on my shirt and it's my mom.

501
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And I said, well, what's up, mom?

502
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And she points to what obviously is the bank manager.

503
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
And she says, what you see there?

504
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000
You know, it was just due to a very nice tailored suit with a nice tie and dress very nice.

505
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And obviously he was, you know, one of the muckity mucks there in the bank, right?

506
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
And I said, why see a man?

507
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
And she says, no.

508
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
I said, I see you.

509
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I said, look at yourself right now.

510
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Of course, I was sweaty.

511
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Kind of dry cake mud on my Levi's pants and tired.

512
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
It says, look at your hands.

513
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
And then I, you know, they're all dirty and everything.

514
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
I said, this is why you have to pointing to my head.

515
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
So this is why you have to work with this.

516
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
If you work with this, that's how you're going to dress.

517
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
And this is where you're going to work.

518
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And it plays like this air conditioning inside in the shade.

519
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
But if you work with this, says your body is going to break down.

520
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
You may be able to do it for a few years, but eventually your body is going to break down.

521
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
So she would always say, oh, I, you know, you better do well in school.

522
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
So they both kind of like bombarded us from different directions.

523
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And subtle and not two subtle ways of making sure.

524
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
She was the one that was helped us develop the study habits.

525
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Because as soon as we came home, you know, my parents would always race from the fields back home to make sure they were home before we got home from school.

526
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
So we wouldn't find an empty house.

527
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
And my mom's routine was she would dart to the kitchen.

528
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
She would make her fresh tortillas.

529
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
The beans, rice and salsa.

530
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
And that was the bait because we would come home from school.

531
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
We would come home from school. We were hungry.

532
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
And she would sit us down and she would feed us.

533
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
But then we couldn't get up.

534
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
He says crack open your books.

535
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Show me that you finish your homework.

536
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Do your homework and show me you finish.

537
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And only until then, we would be allowed to get up and go to play outside with our friends.

538
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000
But she was one that instilled those study habits that, you know, came in handy once he started college.

539
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000
The fact that you had that discipline of saying, hey, I got to take care of this before I go enjoy myself.

540
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Here's another impactful moment fast forward and a little bit.

541
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
It was during that particular summer of 1969 when a major event occurred that would make a big difference in my life.

542
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Despite the war in Vietnam, the internal conflicts in the US and the hippie movement, it was important year for humanity.

543
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
It was a year that left a strong impression on me at the tender age of seven.

544
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
On the morning of July 20th, 1969, the entire world was glued to the television set,

545
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
waiting in awe for an historic event to take place.

546
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Man kind had managed to do the unthinkable.

547
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
A person was about to set foot on the moon.

548
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Later that night, the first images of Neil Armstrong on the surface of the La Luna were transmitted in the households around the globe when he put his foot on the moon.

549
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
He uttered the famous line that transcended time.

550
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

551
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
When I heard these words, I felt indescribably shocked.

552
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
I was captivated by this man, by this science which left me in awe.

553
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Absorb in the broadcast, I got up abruptly to get closer to the television screen.

554
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
I had an epiphany.

555
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
During that exact moment, I discovered what I wanted to be when I grew up, an astronaut.

556
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And from that moment on, I was determined that absolutely nothing would get in the way of my dream.

557
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And thus the dream was born.

558
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
There it is.

559
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
You remember watching that, huh?

560
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Yeah, it was such a big event.

561
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
You know, I think everybody would, in the whole world,

562
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I was watching that because it was an amazement because to think that,

563
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
you know, the Apollo rocket and the capsule,

564
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
you know, which has less computing power than your average cell phone,

565
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
was able to go and using vacuum tube technology,

566
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
were able to go to the surface of the moon,

567
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
send a couple of humans down there and then bring them back home safe and sound.

568
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I mean, it was just amazing.

569
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
It was like start track going live.

570
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
You know, so I was just amazing.

571
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
That was, you know, this is, this is what I want to be.

572
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Another, you're parents are getting a lot of credit.

573
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
A lot of credit today.

574
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Here's another little point where they get a ton of credit.

575
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
The only people I did share this dream with were my parents and to my pleasant surprise.

576
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
They offered me with words of encouragement.

577
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
My father sat me down at the same kitchen table where my mother made us do our homework every day and offered me a few words of advice.

578
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
He said, if I followed his recipe, I could do anything that I wanted to,

579
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
when I grew up because we lived in the United States.

580
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
He explained to me that my siblings and I had the opportunity to live the American dream.

581
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Looking at me very seriously, he said,

582
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
first identify what you want to be when you grow up.

583
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Second, know how far you are from your goal.

584
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Third, draw yourself a road map that gives you all the steps it will take to get there.

585
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Fourth, get yourself a good education.

586
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Fifth and finally apply the same work ethic that you have in your work in the fields to your books.

587
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
And subsequently to your job, but once you graduate from college, mix all this together, Jose.

588
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000
And you can be successful at anything you want to do, including becoming an astronaut.

589
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Yep, out of the gate, I took that hook line and sinker because when you're seven and you're ten years old,

590
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
and your father tells you something, you believe it.

591
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
So if he told me, follow this recipe and you'll become an astronaut.

592
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
And I took that hook line and sinker, I said, I'm going to be an astronaut.

593
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
I really believe that at the time because I said, these are steps I can follow.

594
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And I believe my father and this is why I love sharing that recipe because it works.

595
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
It works.

596
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
This is why I try to tell people, I said, to reach your full potential,

597
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:27.000
say, follow these five simple ingredients. Later I added a six ingredient, which is perseverance, and we'll talk about that a little later.

598
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
But I added that six ingredient, and I said, yes, follow these six ingredients.

599
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
So you know, sky is now a longer than limit.

600
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Space is because I proved that.

601
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.000
You know what's amazing when you're sitting there saying that when you're a kid and your parents tell you something, you listen to them.

602
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
I mean, imagine if you're a dad would have had a different attitude.

603
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
If your dad would have said, oh, you'll never be an astronaut or you don't have the chance of doing it.

604
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I would have never been ever what had done it.

605
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
No, because I would have believed them.

606
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
I said, you know, this is too money meant for me.

607
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And where I'm at, social economically, you know, it's not for me.

608
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
And I would have believed it.

609
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
If I'd have were to tell me that.

610
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:12.000
And it sounded like early on, your dad, especially, was pretty adamant about you understanding that your future is your choice.

611
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
You know, and he provided the alternative right up front for you.

612
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
You experienced it, you know, working in the fields.

613
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And then so I've got to imagine you coming to him with a choice.

614
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:32.000
You've decided, you know, at this point is a young kid that space is, is it for you, you know, being an astronaut?

615
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
So I've got to imagine, you know, he was really open to that and, you know,

616
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:52.000
and I'm certain, you know, he didn't believe I can reach it, you know, obviously, but he was so interested in us getting an education that it's like, you know,

617
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
he said, if that's what motivates him to go to college, finish high school and go to college, so be it.

618
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
I mean, this is the same thing I tell my kid, I'm my oldest kid.

619
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:09.000
He's a, he's finishing up his PhD in Purdue and aerospace engineering has two masters at bachelor's.

620
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.000
And, and, and, and I told him, you know, when when I hooded him for his first masters,

621
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
he was standing there in line, we had never talked about his future in terms of where he wanted to work.

622
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000
And I thought he was, he was done with his first masters, but, you know, he said he was going to graduate school and he won his PhD and I said,

623
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Oh, cool, great, that's great.

624
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, um, I remember I, as I, we were standing there in line,

625
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
I told him, son, why, why Purdue?

626
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And, he said that, you know, I took a page off of your book. He says, I, um,

627
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I made a list of all the astronauts that got selected by NASA or they graduated and guess which school has graduated the most astronauts.

628
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
I said, let me guess Purdue.

629
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
He said, yes, including Neil Armstrong.

630
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
And so, so, that's when I told him, you know, that's when I told him, I said, son,

631
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
if wanting to be an astronaut motivates you to get your PhD, I said, you go on and be an astronaut because, you know what?

632
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Once you get that PhD, there's going to be a lot of opportunities open up for you.

633
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
You may not make it to be an astronaut, but I think you will.

634
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:34.000
I said, I think you can make it, but you're going to have so many other choices in life with two masters in PhD and bachelor's and so, so yeah, exactly.

635
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Powerful.

636
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Yeah.

637
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Um, your family eventually, um, moves into a little place and eventually buys a place.

638
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Yes.

639
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Eventually buys a place you say here after a few more years of renting my parents would buy this house from a landlord.

640
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
I was a landlord facilitated a rent to own finance plan that I as a 12 year old kid helped translate and explained to my father.

641
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Finally, the family had a place to call home, although our new barrio or neighborhood was far from ideal.

642
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
It had a slew of problems, just as any other barrio in south and east stocked and did.

643
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Since we were in the old, in one of the older, more depressed neighborhood, we went as far more crime than other people who lived in the newer part of town.

644
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I started to become more fast-formed a little bit. I started to become more social at school and in my barrio.

645
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
It was at free-mont middle school where I met Carlos and his older brother Alberto.

646
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Another person I hung around with in school was my friend Sergio. He lived across the street for me.

647
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
The four of us were like brothers. We stick together through our adolescent years.

648
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
We were there for each other in good times and in bad times.

649
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Do you guys know what a pocho is? Ask Carlos.

650
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
While we were sitting on the stairs in front of my house, no Sergio and I answered jointly.

651
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000
A pocho is a Mexican born here in the United States who is neither a Mexican nor an American like us.

652
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.000
He explained. Carlos and Sergio wore those white t-shirts without sleeves, baggy gray, khaki pants,

653
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
and shiny black stacey Adams dress shoes that always look too big for their feet.

654
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Their accessories generally consisted of a bandana either neatly folded in their back pocket

655
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000
or worn around their head covering most of their forehead and a chain that hung from their belt loop.

656
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Is it a bad thing to be a pocho? I asked.

657
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000
No, but in case you haven't noticed, they don't seem to like us here in the US or in Mexico.

658
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
They will pick on us here or there. That's why we have to stick together.

659
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
If we don't, we'll be easy targets and they'll get us. Who will get us?

660
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
The Gringos and the Mexicans that have come straight from Mexico.

661
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
As I said, they don't like us. When we go to Mexico, they tell us that we're too Americanized.

662
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Meanwhile, the Gringos calls dirty Mexicans. Either way, we can't win.

663
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
It's like we have no roots and don't belong either place.

664
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
I'm telling you, that's why we have to stick together.

665
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Fast forward a little bit. Things around my neighborhood would never easy.

666
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Gangs were everywhere. They congregated on a daily basis, hoping to define their territories.

667
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Drugs like marijuana were commonly used and sold in our barrio.

668
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Drive by shootings occurred to a lesser extent, but nonetheless kept the neighborhood on edge.

669
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Families were dysfunctional, divided and grew apart due to inattentive parents suffering from alcoholism

670
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000
or other various addictions. The children from these broken homes were quickly recruited to join gangs.

671
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
So, year after year, the membership of these groups multiplied.

672
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I admit that it was difficult to escape that environment. Although I managed to steer clear of such activities,

673
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
I had to somewhat assimilate in order to survive.

674
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Soon, my appearance and attitude begin to change.

675
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
As I spent more time with Carlos Alberto and Sergio, I became tougher and tougher.

676
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Or so, I fought. I began wearing baggy pants, oversized flannel shirts and shoes that were one size too big.

677
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
I walked down the streets with an attitude while I was emulating Alberto's gestures.

678
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000
My objective was to conceal the true Jose while trying to look like the rest of my peers.

679
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
I did not want to be labeled a school boy or bookworm so that I could avoid being harassed.

680
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
However, when I was in class and with my family, I was my true self. I was playful, studious and responsible.

681
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
But when I was on the streets, I was one of the homeboys, as we poachos would call ourselves.

682
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:33.000
The price of assimilation was steep. Soon, I started to deny I knew how to speak Spanish and I began paying less attention to my Mexican roots.

683
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
So, there are some alternative paths besides the one that you are trying to go down.

684
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
That's right.

685
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
These three friends of mine that are what age group, what age are you at this point?

686
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
This is a junior high.

687
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
This is a 12, 13, 14 here.

688
00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And at that point where you are, there is some point in your life that marks you that says,

689
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Hey, I've got to change the way things are in the direction I'm heading.

690
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Because I was doing that with my friends because you had to do that in the neighborhood.

691
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:20.000
But then you went back to school, you went back home and you tried to clean yourself up so that your parents don't see you turning into a thug, right?

692
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Kind of thing.

693
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
And then you start thinking about, okay, I'm doing this more and more and more and more.

694
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Am I going into deep kind of thing and you try to extract yourself from it?

695
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
And you see your buddies, they went into it.

696
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:45.000
And they went into it feet first and didn't try to come back. They embraced it and got deeper and deeper and started using drugs.

697
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
I didn't use drugs.

698
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Then they started dealing with drugs.

699
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
And when I started seeing all these things of how it was changing them.

700
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Because they were a good two, three months ahead of me in the process of transformation, if you will.

701
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
And I saw where they were heading.

702
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
And I saw that roadmap and I said, man, I don't want to be like them.

703
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.000
And little by little I just started pulling away hanging out less and less with them.

704
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
And to the point that when I got into high school, you know, well, these guys did,

705
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
made the transition to high school probably once a semester and then they just stopped going.

706
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
And I kept going through high school of course.

707
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000
And so they were still my homeboys. They were still in the neighborhood.

708
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:40.000
And in a sense it was great that they were still around because, you know, that was kind of like the protection that I had in the neighborhood.

709
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Because they knew I was, you know, everybody else knew I was associated with them.

710
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
And so no one dared mess with me because then they had to respond to these guys.

711
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
They were very good and, you know, they respected the decision I made.

712
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.000
And it's not like they harass me and so we're going to get you now because you left that they actually said, no, you go do it.

713
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
That's that's pretty awesome for them to be able to say that.

714
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Because a lot of times what you find with kids is they don't want anyone to get ahead.

715
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
They don't want anyone to go further.

716
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
They'd rather just drag them back down.

717
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000
And I see that in every actually I see that not just with kids.

718
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:27.000
I see that with that with humans, human beings. There's a lot of human beings that when somebody makes a move to try and elevate and try and go further and try and do more.

719
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
People discourage them and set it encouraging them.

720
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Yeah, it's the crabs and the bucket crabs and buckets.

721
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Yeah, one starts coming out, hey, come on down here and you get pulled back down.

722
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000
So that's a real, it's a real testament to those guys that they actually instead of trying to drag you back down.

723
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
They try to lift you up and help you get out of there.

724
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Was there anything that that happened that you saw?

725
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Well, well, how did you recognize that the path that they were going down was not the right path?

726
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Because you know, you write it about it in here.

727
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Here are these guys.

728
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
You know, when you're 13, 14 years old, what do you want?

729
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Well, you want money, you want girls.

730
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
You know, you want a cool car.

731
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
You want to be popular.

732
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
And here are these guys. Well, guess what, that money they had, you know,

733
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
They had girls.

734
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
They had girls.

735
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
So they kind of had the stuff that a young 14, 15 year old kid wants.

736
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000
How did you realize that the path that they were going down was the wrong path?

737
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Very easy.

738
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
We went cruising one day.

739
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000
We would cruise around Stribby Park and then we got shot at that way.

740
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
I said, I don't want to be a statistic.

741
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
You know, we got shot at.

742
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
And because these guys are dealing and must have been dealing in a wrong area.

743
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
And they got shot at and I was in there.

744
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
You know, innocent bystander, but I was there.

745
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
And they were carrying, you know, and I said, man, I don't want to do this.

746
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
This is how I want to end up.

747
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
And you were able to see that luckily.

748
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Yeah. You know, you tell, you got another story in here that's an interesting story.

749
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
It's good. It's just a good life lesson. You found a wallet with money.

750
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Tell us that story real quick.

751
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Yeah, yeah. We found a, I found a wallet and, and I forget how much money.

752
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
It had a significant, I had like about $6,700 in cash.

753
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And, but it had a, it had a, you know, an ID and everything.

754
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000
And I had an address and everything. And I remember I found it.

755
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
I went home to my dad, you know, and I said that.

756
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
I found this wallet.

757
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
So what's in it?

758
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
I said, there's about 600 bucks in it.

759
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000
But dad looks at it first. And, you know, you see the temptation he had just as I did.

760
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000
And I think more than anything he just wanted to teach me a lesson and say, you know,

761
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000
if there's an owner here, we ought to try and reach out for him and try and do.

762
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
And unfortunately, he lived like an Oakland or somewhere.

763
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.000
He was visiting relative. So we waited like about a week or two when we had a weekend.

764
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
And then we drove to Oakland.

765
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:23.000
And we found the address and I gave it to the guy, the guy, it was an older man, you know, probably in the 60s.

766
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
And said somebody had sold something at college.

767
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
I'm not forget what he did. And he said, he had lost the whole wall.

768
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
And he thought he would never see it. He couldn't believe it.

769
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
And he gave me a $20 reward or something like that.

770
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
And I was happy I said, I did something good.

771
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And I got 20 bucks out of it. So I think he gave my dad another 20 for the gas and stuff.

772
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
But yeah.

773
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
But teaching that lesson of doing the right thing, doing the right thing, even though it might

774
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
sting your from sting your money.

775
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
And that's the right thing to do. And that's what your dad was wanting you to know.

776
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And that was at the same age. That was kind of that same same time for in 14th.

777
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
No, that was a little younger. Probably a little younger.

778
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
I was probably 11, 12, 10.

779
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Still that kind of money as in 11 year old.

780
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Yeah.

781
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
That's a lot of money.

782
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
It's a lot of money today.

783
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Yeah.

784
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.000
For me.

785
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Six hundred bucks.

786
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
That's a lot.

787
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
14, I probably would have said, you know, this is a good dumping for my car.

788
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
I'm going to get the next year or something. But now I was to young.

789
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Fast forward a little bit.

790
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
I started my freshman year.

791
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Fresh New Year of high school at Franklin High School at East Stockton at that time.

792
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Frank was one of the toughest schools in Stockton with a delicate balance of Caucasian, Latino, and African American students.

793
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Fast forward.

794
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000
I found refuge in something I awkwardly called my best friend.

795
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Math.

796
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Yes, math made me smile.

797
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.000
It was fun. It remained my strongest subject as I maintained good grades throughout four years in high school.

798
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000
You talk about a guy, Mr. Zendayas.

799
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Zendayas sells and dejas.

800
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:01.000
And he told you, you were kind of talking to him about, you know, your past and your history and your ancestors.

801
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.000
And he said, I think you can find who you really are in the history of your ancestors country.

802
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
I know I did.

803
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Jose, don't ever be ashamed of your culture and its traditions.

804
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000
There what make up your identity. You should be proud of who you are.

805
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Do you know why?

806
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
No, I answered attentively.

807
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Because you belong to two countries and two cultures.

808
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
And that's a wonderful thing, not everyone is as fortunate as you are.

809
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.000
So that's a kind of a reversal on the photo thing where they're telling you don't speak Spanish.

810
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Like people, like your friends, hey, we don't speak Spanish.

811
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
You were hiding the fact that you spoke Spanish.

812
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Yes.

813
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
And I'll tell you shortly after, uh,

814
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:51.000
South and Neha's my teacher said that, you know, I think I was in a junior in high school.

815
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
And I must show you, talk about the homecoming float.

816
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
But, uh, it falls very good, uh, with this story.

817
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Was when, um, when I was a, a junior in high school, um, you know, I started participating in student government.

818
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Senior, I became a student by the president, but in junior, I was barely starting.

819
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
So I was part of the student council.

820
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
And so I went to the meetings.

821
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
And we were getting ready for homecoming.

822
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:27.000
And of course, every class, the senior class, the junior class, the sophomore freshman, have a float.

823
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
All right.

824
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
And they, they have a homecoming float.

825
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
And I remember ours, we, we, we wanted to build a float and everything.

826
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000
And, um, and they were saying, okay, but we need a, uh, a flatbed and a truck.

827
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Uh, does anyone have a flatbed and truck and no one had one, uh,

828
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
because my dad drove a flatbed and a truck.

829
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
So I knew I had one, right.

830
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.000
But I wouldn't say anything because I knew my dad, my dad is not going to lend it to us in the sense of

831
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Drop it off somewhere where we can work and use it.

832
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000
And then, uh, he'll go pick it up when we're done.

833
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000
He's not like that. He's good. He's, he's the type that says, oh, yeah, you guys want to show

834
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
you can use it, but you guys come here.

835
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
So I can keep my eye on my truck and my flatbed.

836
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
So, so you have to come here.

837
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000
And of course, we lived in East Stockton, worst part of Stockton.

838
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000
And we lived in, uh, at the time it was a, that two bedroom, the laparated rental that we still didn't own yet.

839
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
And, um, I actually, we did on it, by then.

840
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
And so we owned it.

841
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:38.000
But it was in the worst part of Stockton. And, um, and, and so I was embarrassed to have my classmates come to my house.

842
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Because I figured, you know, surely they live in better houses and this two bedroom they laparated, uh,

843
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
a piece of junk that we lived in, right, but that was our home.

844
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
And so I resisted it.

845
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
And we had meeting after meeting.

846
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:57.000
And then it became clear that the very last meeting, they were going to cancel the junior entry for the home

847
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
of Stockton.

848
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Because we didn't have, we didn't have a flatbed or a truck.

849
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
I finally had a mess up.

850
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
I said, you know, I have one.

851
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000
And you do great.

852
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
I said, but there's a catch and I said, what's that?

853
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
We got to build a float in my house in our front yard there at the flatbed there.

854
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
My dad wanted to take it anyway.

855
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Oh, no worry.

856
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
We'll go and twist the address.

857
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000
So I gave him the address and, you know, I'm building a float.

858
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
It's after class.

859
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000
You start on the Monday because the thing is on Friday.

860
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:34.000
And so we started on Monday and, and so people came.

861
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000
And I remember the first day I was kind of like embarrassed, but, you know, if they all jumped on the truck that started working on it,

862
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000
then also my mom starts bringing in burritos, tacos, awafadeska.

863
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
My dad brings out the boom box and puts a music.

864
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
My brothers and sisters start helping out.

865
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
The next day, word got out.

866
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
There's good food.

867
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
The party party.

868
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Yeah, it was a good food.

869
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000
So I got bigger.

870
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
You know, by Thursday, it was like, you know, it was overflowing and it was great.

871
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And I remember a guy, a friend of mine, comes to me and he looks at me.

872
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And he says, man, I'm so jealous of you.

873
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And I said, jealous of me.

874
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And this is a Caucasian guy lived in Northside of Stockton.

875
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Good place stuff.

876
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
He had one of those, you know, what smoking the bandit cars or trans-amps.

877
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Trans-amps.

878
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Oh, yeah.

879
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you started driving and he got a new car.

880
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And he said he was jealous of me.

881
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And I said, dude, look what you're driving.

882
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And your jealous of me.

883
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And he said, yeah, I said, you know, I, um, sure I have this new car.

884
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And I live in North Stockton.

885
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So this is, but, you know, my parents are divorced.

886
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I never seen my dad.

887
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
My mom's a nurse.

888
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
She works long hours.

889
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I hardly see her.

890
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I always come home to an empty house.

891
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And the thing you come home to this is what I want.

892
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And that's when I realized that, you know,

893
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000
bringing in both parts of my culture to identify who Jose is.

894
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
What's the best thing to do?

895
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000
That's when I stopped being embarrassed of my Mexican heritage.

896
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
That's when I embraced it.

897
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And I said, you know, with lots of pride, yeah, I'm in Mexican American.

898
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Because I'm able to get the best of both cultures to define who Jose is today.

899
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And so that's, you know, after hearing sent and Mr. Sandejas's words, you know,

900
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I put it to use and I realized I had this kind of

901
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
conclusion that said, hey, it's not bad getting the best things above cultures.

902
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Of course, there's people that get the worst things above cultures.

903
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And that's real bad.

904
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
You know, that's my buddies down the street, but you know, that's another thing.

905
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It's all a little much focus on too, right?

906
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Exactly.

907
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
You know, you focused on those positive aspects, you know,

908
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
pursued that took you places.

909
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah.

910
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
You talk about that you didn't up being the, like you said,

911
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
the student body president class president.

912
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That's pretty cool.

913
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
You talk about the election here and stuff like that.

914
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Fast forward a little bit.

915
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
You say one day I heard news, a news brief on the radio that said,

916
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Costa Rican Franklin Chang Diaz, the first Latino American astronaut

917
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
candidate at NASA, makes his dream come true.

918
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
The news commentator talked in depth about Dr. Chang Diaz's struggles

919
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
and triumphs in his quest to become an astronaut.

920
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
He's a astronaut, quote, Franklin Chang was born in 1950 in San Jose, Costa Rica.

921
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
He was sent to the United States after finishing his secondary education with only

922
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
$50 to his name and without knowing a single word of English.

923
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
He recounted that all he had was a suitcase full of aspirations and,

924
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
quote, so there you had a little someone to relate to a little bit.

925
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
You were looking at him that way.

926
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Exactly.

927
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
What I figured he was opening the road for others.

928
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Once they selected the first Hispanic American astronaut,

929
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I said, well, then that opens the door up for me.

930
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And so, yes, so he was someone that really kind of put few to my added

931
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
feud with my fire of wanting to become an astronaut.

932
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Now I said, now I know it's possible because he's living proof.

933
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And I've re-reasonated so much because he had brown skin like I have

934
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
he spoke with an accent like I did.

935
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
And he came from very humble beginnings just like I did.

936
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I said, well, if he can do it, why can I?

937
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And so it empowered me.

938
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You got into a bunch of different universities.

939
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Get done with high school, fast forward a little bit.

940
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
You end up going to the University of the Pacific, which is up in Stockton.

941
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Had a great engineering programs.

942
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And it would allow you to be at home.

943
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah, I saved down room and boy.

944
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And then I was able to work in the fall at the canary during the night shift.

945
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I remember the first two months of school was always tough because it was August, September.

946
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And then as you get more seniority, you're going to October, November, and the canaries.

947
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And then you get laid off.

948
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
But I remember, you know, it's tough because you go to work at.

949
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And that canary was only a block away, so I would walk to the canary from my house.

950
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And I would walk in this big yellow raincoat because I worked in clean up from 10 at night to 6 in the morning.

951
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And then I will get home, shower, eat something.

952
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And then my classes started at 8 o'clock at EOP finished at about 2, 3.

953
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And then did some homework.

954
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And then fell asleep about 7 and about 930 get back up and go back to work.

955
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
On the grind.

956
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
On the grind.

957
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Yeah, that's what.

958
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
You know, it was only short periods like three months kind of thing.

959
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I have on average it was about three months.

960
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But you know, that helped me.

961
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The canary paid pretty well compared to field morning.

962
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So they paid very well.

963
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So that along with the fact that I didn't have to pay room and board,

964
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
allowed me to go to Pacific and you know pay the tuition.

965
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.000
My part of the tuition because I got Cal Grand, the pale Grand, those type of assistance to get to help pay for the tuition.

966
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I got to cover this one one section because we talked about a little bit.

967
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Talk about your friends here.

968
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Years later after drifting apart, I would find out that he did.

969
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
This is Carlos.

970
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
He did indeed not continue his education.

971
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
He ended up doing low skilled work and low paying draw jobs.

972
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Drugs robbed his brother Alberto of his future.

973
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
They found Alberto's lifeless body in his apartment and autopsy revealed that he died of a drug overdose.

974
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
He was probably the result of heroin or cocaine use.

975
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
As for my neighbor Sergio, he too did not have an opportunity to make something of himself.

976
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
One day years later as I was getting an award for one of my projects.

977
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I received a call from my mother who told me that the neighbor stumbled upon his body,

978
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
which was hanging from a tree in the park.

979
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
To my knowledge, no rest were made in connection with his death.

980
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It remains unclear as to whether it was suicide or a homicide.

981
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I truly believe my friends were not the individuals they appeared to be.

982
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I was a little boy who needed role models in their lives to steer them in the right direction.

983
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
If someone would have made them realize the importance of going to school or infused them with self-confidence,

984
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
their destinies would have been very different.

985
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
When I received word of their deaths, I felt impotent,

986
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
wondering perhaps if I could have done something to help them make the right decisions.

987
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:48.000
When you were talking earlier about Mrs. Young or Mrs. Young,

988
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.000
and it's not just educators that have the opportunity to have a huge impact on people's lives.

989
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
If you're listening to this right now, you can help so many people that you reach out,

990
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
talk to them, try and show them the right direction.

991
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000
You don't have to be in a position of authority to be able to help people in the right direction.

992
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
That was the great differentiator between them and I.

993
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
You look at my parents that were involved.

994
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
They didn't know.

995
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
They didn't go to PTA meetings and none of that.

996
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
But they were involved with keeping an eye on us, making sure we wouldn't stray,

997
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and making sure we were doing well in school, whereas with my friends,

998
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
you know, four or four, one of them, the one that lives across the street,

999
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
he, you know, his father was never there.

1000
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
He would only come, he would come home like a day two days before the first swipe,

1001
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
because that was when the welfare check arrived.

1002
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And he was sweet talk his wife, you know, take like 90% of the money,

1003
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
disappear for the rest of the month, and then give him 10% to fend for the rest of the month

1004
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
or the whole family, which was terrible.

1005
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And then on the other side, the two brothers, both the mother and father were aquahollics.

1006
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And so it was a dysfunctional family on both sides there that didn't help him.

1007
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And so when you become successful and then you hear what happens to your buddies,

1008
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
you can't, you know, feel, you know, you can't help it, but to feel bad,

1009
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000
because you say, is there anything I could have done to have helped them along the way?

1010
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
So they wouldn't have end up the way they have end up in, you know, ended up in, you know,

1011
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
one old deed and another one still selling drugs on the street and the other one,

1012
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
a parent suicide.

1013
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And you say, you know, you do feel guilty because you say, you know, maybe I could have done something.

1014
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But you know, who knows?

1015
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
You know, speaking of people having, it tells a little bit about,

1016
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
San Yota Bello.

1017
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Oh, San Yota Bello.

1018
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Yeah, okay.

1019
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Bello. Yeah.

1020
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
She was a tough cookie.

1021
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
She started off in, actually in, in, in, in, junior high.

1022
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And then when we went to high school, she actually transferred to the high school.

1023
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So we got double dose of her.

1024
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I don't know if it was good or bad, but the, the first dose I got of her was in junior high.

1025
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And, and she was the one that basically, remember I told you, I started to forget my Spanish and everything.

1026
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:42.000
She's the one that sort of turned that around and said, no, you will learn Spanish and you will learn it in a correct manner.

1027
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
You know, and all that stuff is my fact I went, I went to Waterlahara.

1028
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
She was a Spanish teacher, so she set up a trip to Mexico.

1029
01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And we went to a blind school and got boarded there and, and would spend like two weeks during Easter in, in, in Mexico.

1030
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And, and so she was tough as nails.

1031
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
You know, she was a tough cookie, tough grader, everything, didn't cut you any slack.

1032
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And, and then in high school, she became biology teacher.

1033
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:20.000
So then I went to Mexico, Baja, California, twice with her, again on Easter with the biology kids.

1034
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And we would do plant taxonomy in, in marine biology in, in Baja.

1035
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And, you know, we would, like, make corners of different quadrants.

1036
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And we would have to classify every plant in that quadrant.

1037
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So you get a good idea of what kind of vegetation existed in the Baja desert kind of thing.

1038
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And it, we were always sleeping under a tent and stuff like that.

1039
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So it was, it was, it was interesting times there.

1040
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
And again, she was very, very tough on us, but, you know, that's what prepared me for college, man.

1041
01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Because without her toughness, I think I wouldn't have had the mental toughness to get through physics and chemistry and calculus and all those engineering courses.

1042
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah, you ran into her as you were starting university.

1043
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And, and, and one thing she told you in this is going back to the book, she said,

1044
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You're all grown up now who's a, you're about to turn 18 in a bark on a bark on your college career.

1045
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
You know, I was once young and college just like you.

1046
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I know the challenges you're going to face.

1047
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
The only thing I ask of you is not to forget who you are and where you come from.

1048
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Don't allow anything or anyone to deter you from your schoolwork.

1049
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
She, she was staying on you.

1050
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Yeah.

1051
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yeah.

1052
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
She was, she was a second mother. She was exactly like a second mother.

1053
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And so she kept an eye on this.

1054
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
You got a cool story in here.

1055
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I got to read this one because I, I enjoyed it.

1056
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
You're checking into your first one of these classes.

1057
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Good morning class.

1058
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I'm Professor Andre's Rodriguez.

1059
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I will be teaching you physics.

1060
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Are there any questions?

1061
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Dr. Rodriguez was very short man with silver weight hair,

1062
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
who always seemed to have an unlit cigar used more like a pacifier in his mouth for his hand.

1063
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
He talked with a very heavy accent because of the cigar I guessed he was of Cuban descent.

1064
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Later I would find out my assumptions to be correct.

1065
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Will a syllabus be handed out?

1066
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Asked a female classmate, classmate very hesitantly?

1067
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Syllabus.

1068
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
There's no need for one.

1069
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
The curriculum of this class is going to be something none of you have ever seen before.

1070
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It's not going to make any sense without me personally guiding you throughout the semester.

1071
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Let's begin.

1072
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Shall we?

1073
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I shared with goosebumps when I heard him speak and what I thought was an unfriendly tone.

1074
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Looking around the classroom and seeing all the new faces once again brought me back the same feelings I had

1075
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
When I was in elementary school when I was trying to figure out what the writing on the chalkboard meant.

1076
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
The only difference now was that the board was plastered with symbols and numbers,

1077
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
not words in a foreign language.

1078
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I did not know.

1079
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Just ten minutes into his lecture I was beginning to think that there was no way I would ever pass this class.

1080
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
The chalkboard was filling up with one physics formula after another.

1081
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I might as well have been staring at Egyptian high-row-gleaf graphics.

1082
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
The professor Rodriguez was talking and writing so quickly that I could barely keep up.

1083
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I just wrote down everything he wrote down as fast as I could without understanding any of it.

1084
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Any questions he asked?

1085
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
No one raised a hand.

1086
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I took a deep breath and as I excelled I dared to raise my hand.

1087
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Professor Rodriguez, I really don't understand anything you just wrote on the board.

1088
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I told him some of my classmates began to laugh making me feel like an idiot for raising my hands.

1089
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Professor Rodriguez looked at me smile and asked what's your name?

1090
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Jose, I responded.

1091
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Well Jose, the reason why you don't understand anything that I wrote is because it's nonsense.

1092
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
It's nonsense.

1093
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It's a joke and if you all look closely you will see that this was a lesson in disguise.

1094
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Everyone became silent, embarrassed by both their own ignorance and their fear of not speaking up.

1095
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
They all seem to wish they had found themselves asking for clarification.

1096
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That's a good trick.

1097
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
You referred back to someone else here.

1098
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Dr. Jones, who said, don't ever be left with any doubts or questions.

1099
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Better to be ignorant for a moment than for life.

1100
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
If you don't understand something simply ask.

1101
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
That's correct.

1102
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Good lesson learned right there.

1103
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Well, yeah, I figured, you know, and Dr. Jones was the director of a program there at UOP University Pacific,

1104
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:31.000
the community involvement program which gave scholarships to kids from the local area to attend the University, which is a private university.

1105
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And they paid up to like 80% of your tuition.

1106
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So I remember, you know, we had like a two week orientation before school started.

1107
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And one of the things this was, this was an African American tall gentleman, Dr. Jones.

1108
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And he would always call the, you know, his kids, you know, from the program.

1109
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
But he would always say, hey, you need to sit in the front of the class.

1110
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Don't sit in the back. Why get it filtered?

1111
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Sit in the front. Ask questions always do.

1112
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And it says, and then he would say, you know, Jose, you know,

1113
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
you know, you were giving you a scholarship, right? I said, yeah, so, but how much are you paying a year?

1114
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So I still have to come up with about $3,000.

1115
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
It says, okay, get your money's worth.

1116
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And so that's exactly what I thought of when Dr. Rodriguez was doing all this stuff.

1117
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And I was sitting there in front and writing everything.

1118
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I understand none of this crap.

1119
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Don't understand it.

1120
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And I said, man, I'm paying three grand.

1121
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask, I'm going to go on my money's worth.

1122
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So I asked, and I said, I don't understand it.

1123
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And that's when he said, good, I'm glad you don't get you shouldn't.

1124
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I just want to teach you guys the lessons that because we're going to go through a tough course here.

1125
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
If you guys have any questions, you ask them.

1126
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So don't assume, because it's only going to get worse.

1127
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
It's going to get worse if you let it pile on.

1128
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
You need to understand the basics.

1129
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So ask questions.

1130
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Then he started with his lesson.

1131
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I didn't go to college until I was older than Navy sent me to college when I was 28 years old.

1132
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And I was, I would sit right in the front row.

1133
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And if a professor talked about something that I didn't understand,

1134
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I would just immediately raise my hand.

1135
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I don't understand that because I was a grown man.

1136
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You know, I didn't care what the other kids thought.

1137
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I just wanted to make sure I understood what they were putting out.

1138
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But that's something I learned in the Seal Teams.

1139
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
If you're starting to learn a tactic or a technique,

1140
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and you're not getting it and you try and pretend like you get it.

1141
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
It's going to catch you.

1142
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It's going to bite you.

1143
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
It's going to bite you.

1144
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It's going to bite you.

1145
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
That same thing being an astronaut is that you can't pretend.

1146
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
You got to understand because you know what?

1147
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
This is a little button.

1148
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
It could save you or kill you.

1149
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Fast forward a little bit.

1150
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
You end up with a job opportunity.

1151
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
This was not only a job.

1152
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
It was an opportunity.

1153
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is a premier research facility dedicated

1154
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
to national defense and his funded through the Department of Energy.

1155
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
It was located just 40 miles from my home, allowing me to commute to work.

1156
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
While I was making some money to, I could not stop thinking of how I would feel on the first day

1157
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
walking through those doors.

1158
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
So you had this opportunity to get this job at a lab.

1159
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
That's a huge opportunity.

1160
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Yes.

1161
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It's a premier national laboratory R&D in defense applications.

1162
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So what year did you do that?

1163
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Was that, did you start interning there?

1164
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Yes.

1165
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I started interning in 83 and again in 84.

1166
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And then I got offered a job in 85 career.

1167
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
But I went to my master's degree and then I got hired in 87.

1168
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Four times.

1169
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Fast forward a little bit in May of 1985.

1170
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
At the age of 22, I found myself dressed in a black and orange graduation gown with my standard

1171
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
issued black cap ready for college graduation.

1172
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I could hear my mother's applause.

1173
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I walked across the stage and received my diploma because it was the loudest.

1174
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
With my degree in hand, I stopped the show or what I had written on top of my cap before

1175
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
exiting the stage.

1176
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It read Ola Mama.

1177
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
It was assembled.

1178
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
My gratitude for everything she had done for me for my entire life.

1179
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I remember clearly how everyone turned to look at her as she rose from her seat.

1180
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And how our crystalline eyes, which were holding back tears, met mine as she blew me a kiss.

1181
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Big day.

1182
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yeah.

1183
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
You said, I wasted no time in starting my career.

1184
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I had Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Livermore California.

1185
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.000
This is where you decide, well, got to go through the mindset here.

1186
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I came to the conclusion that from me to flourish and successfully competing the environment,

1187
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I needed to obtain a postgraduate degree.

1188
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
This realization coupled with the fact that I could not stop thinking about how I could get into the NASA

1189
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
astronaut program led me to my next big decision in life to attend graduate school.

1190
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.20
After all, Dr. Franklin Chang Diaz had a doctorate degree

1191
01:18:58.20 --> 01:19:00.04
and NASA chose him to go into space

1192
01:19:00.04 --> 01:19:02.32
so you're checking these boxes.

1193
01:19:02.32 --> 01:19:04.16
End up going to the University of California,

1194
01:19:04.16 --> 01:19:05.44
Santa Barbara.

1195
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:06.92
And this was the first time you got to go to school

1196
01:19:06.92 --> 01:19:08.36
where all you had to do was go to school.

1197
01:19:08.36 --> 01:19:09.20
Exactly.

1198
01:19:09.20 --> 01:19:11.32
And then the first time I away from home, too.

1199
01:19:11.32 --> 01:19:12.32
Okay.

1200
01:19:12.32 --> 01:19:16.88
And so, but yes, it was the first time I had a full right

1201
01:19:16.88 --> 01:19:19.08
scholarship even paid for my room in board

1202
01:19:19.08 --> 01:19:22.96
and my only job was to go to school.

1203
01:19:22.96 --> 01:19:25.48
Because every other time when I was in undergrad,

1204
01:19:25.48 --> 01:19:28.20
I was in the canary, working restaurants,

1205
01:19:28.20 --> 01:19:31.16
I worked study, tutoring, doing everything.

1206
01:19:31.16 --> 01:19:32.64
I was always busy.

1207
01:19:32.64 --> 01:19:36.16
And here, the only thing I had to do was go to school.

1208
01:19:36.16 --> 01:19:37.20
And it was so easy.

1209
01:19:37.20 --> 01:19:37.88
Luxury.

1210
01:19:37.88 --> 01:19:38.72
It was luxury.

1211
01:19:38.72 --> 01:19:40.72
It was so easy because that's it.

1212
01:19:40.72 --> 01:19:42.56
Well, what else do I always felt when I was there?

1213
01:19:42.56 --> 01:19:45.28
So guilty because I said, what else do I need to do?

1214
01:19:45.28 --> 01:19:46.76
So no, you're all caught up.

1215
01:19:46.76 --> 01:19:47.60
That's luxury.

1216
01:19:47.60 --> 01:19:49.08
I had that kind of luxury too.

1217
01:19:49.08 --> 01:19:50.24
So I went to college.

1218
01:19:50.24 --> 01:19:52.04
The middle, I said the Navy sent me to college.

1219
01:19:52.04 --> 01:19:54.68
But the Navy for some reason, it was an old program.

1220
01:19:54.68 --> 01:19:58.24
I got commissioned as an officer before I went to college.

1221
01:19:58.24 --> 01:20:00.80
So then I did two years at a seal team,

1222
01:20:00.80 --> 01:20:02.000
then they sent me to college.

1223
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.40
So I was an officer.

1224
01:20:03.40 --> 01:20:05.68
I didn't have like Johnny Kim who you know.

1225
01:20:05.68 --> 01:20:08.84
Johnny Kim, when he went to college, he had to do ROTC.

1226
01:20:08.84 --> 01:20:09.96
And we went to the same college,

1227
01:20:09.96 --> 01:20:10.80
University's not anybody.

1228
01:20:10.80 --> 01:20:13.24
He had to go to ROTC and put on his uniform

1229
01:20:13.24 --> 01:20:16.56
and do whatever the Navy requirements work.

1230
01:20:16.56 --> 01:20:17.40
Yeah.

1231
01:20:17.40 --> 01:20:19.68
Me, I was just just go to college.

1232
01:20:19.68 --> 01:20:22.08
Because the exact same as you, just get a full pay.

1233
01:20:22.08 --> 01:20:23.24
I was going to pay check.

1234
01:20:23.24 --> 01:20:24.92
My deal is even better than yours, I think.

1235
01:20:24.92 --> 01:20:26.92
Cause I was getting a full Navy paycheck.

1236
01:20:26.92 --> 01:20:27.92
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
01:20:27.92 --> 01:20:31.76
I was just, I was the highest paid college freshman of all time.

1238
01:20:31.76 --> 01:20:32.76
It was all the way to the end.

1239
01:20:32.76 --> 01:20:33.76
And getting your tuition paid, right?

1240
01:20:33.76 --> 01:20:35.20
Yeah, and my tuition was fully paid.

1241
01:20:35.20 --> 01:20:36.20
Yeah, it was really good.

1242
01:20:36.20 --> 01:20:37.04
That's great.

1243
01:20:37.04 --> 01:20:40.64
But for you, going from where you all your career,

1244
01:20:40.64 --> 01:20:43.96
you weren't working at the cannery from 10 o'clock at night

1245
01:20:43.96 --> 01:20:45.24
till 6th of the morning.

1246
01:20:45.24 --> 01:20:47.96
And now you're just there just focused on school.

1247
01:20:47.96 --> 01:20:48.96
Exactly.

1248
01:20:48.96 --> 01:20:50.32
Exactly, it was.

1249
01:20:50.32 --> 01:20:52.12
Yeah.

1250
01:20:52.12 --> 01:20:54.12
Awesome.

1251
01:20:54.12 --> 01:20:58.08
You were kind of making a transition to another level.

1252
01:20:58.08 --> 01:21:00.000
Meanwhile, this happens.

1253
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.56
Going back to book couple, murdered in Stockton.

1254
01:21:03.56 --> 01:21:04.40
Yeah.

1255
01:21:04.40 --> 01:21:05.24
News article.

1256
01:21:05.24 --> 01:21:07.84
The article confirmed that the victims were family members

1257
01:21:07.84 --> 01:21:09.36
from my father's side.

1258
01:21:09.36 --> 01:21:11.20
Dumb founded, I immediately called my parents

1259
01:21:11.20 --> 01:21:13.28
to inform them of the tragedy, but they already knew.

1260
01:21:13.28 --> 01:21:15.80
They were distraught, understandably so.

1261
01:21:15.80 --> 01:21:18.28
I started thinking my parents live in a neighborhood similar

1262
01:21:18.28 --> 01:21:22.84
to the one where my PO and Dia were just murdered.

1263
01:21:22.84 --> 01:21:27.84
How could I allow my own parents to continue living in such a place?

1264
01:21:27.84 --> 01:21:30.20
So you start feeling like you got to do some of my own parents.

1265
01:21:30.20 --> 01:21:32.52
Now, this is where you start getting psychological back on your parents.

1266
01:21:32.52 --> 01:21:33.52
That's right.

1267
01:21:33.52 --> 01:21:36.64
Because you knew you could just say, hey, I want to move you in with me.

1268
01:21:36.64 --> 01:21:38.60
Well, they're going to be resistant to the resistant

1269
01:21:38.60 --> 01:21:40.88
because they're used to the old neighborhood,

1270
01:21:40.88 --> 01:21:44.44
or used to the corner supermarket and those types of stuff.

1271
01:21:44.44 --> 01:21:46.48
And I knew there was going to be resistance.

1272
01:21:46.48 --> 01:21:46.68
Right.

1273
01:21:46.68 --> 01:21:48.52
But I wanted to get them out of that neighborhood,

1274
01:21:48.52 --> 01:21:51.48
because I said, same thing that happened to my uncles could

1275
01:21:51.48 --> 01:21:52.28
happen to them.

1276
01:21:52.28 --> 01:21:53.92
And of course, they were resistant.

1277
01:21:53.92 --> 01:21:54.72
So go ahead.

1278
01:21:54.72 --> 01:21:55.44
No, you go ahead.

1279
01:21:55.44 --> 01:21:55.88
What did you do?

1280
01:21:55.88 --> 01:21:57.72
You played a little psychological warfare on them.

1281
01:21:57.72 --> 01:21:58.16
Yeah.

1282
01:21:58.16 --> 01:22:01.20
Well, you know, I had just bought a house myself,

1283
01:22:01.20 --> 01:22:03.04
because I was working at Livermore.

1284
01:22:03.04 --> 01:22:08.28
So I bought my first three bedroom to Bath House in North Stockton,

1285
01:22:08.28 --> 01:22:09.72
Nice Area.

1286
01:22:09.72 --> 01:22:12.04
And I was living by myself, of course.

1287
01:22:12.04 --> 01:22:17.28
And somehow I wanted to get them to come live with me.

1288
01:22:17.28 --> 01:22:21.16
And of course, they resisted.

1289
01:22:21.16 --> 01:22:22.60
They said, no, this is our home.

1290
01:22:22.60 --> 01:22:23.72
This is where we belong.

1291
01:22:23.72 --> 01:22:27.84
This is, I said, yeah, but look what happened to Uncle Ann.

1292
01:22:27.84 --> 01:22:30.28
And so no, it's not going to happen to us.

1293
01:22:30.28 --> 01:22:34.48
And finally, I said, this is why I'm going to do, I say,

1294
01:22:34.48 --> 01:22:40.80
I'm going to tell mom that I really need help with the house

1295
01:22:40.80 --> 01:22:42.12
cleaning.

1296
01:22:42.12 --> 01:22:48.76
And also, I'm going to go to the pharmacy.

1297
01:22:48.76 --> 01:22:51.80
They'll buy me a few condoms and kind of just kind of hide them

1298
01:22:51.80 --> 01:22:52.80
where she could find them.

1299
01:22:56.80 --> 01:22:59.24
And I know she was going to clean and she's going to find them.

1300
01:22:59.24 --> 01:23:01.80
She's probably not going to say anything to me about them.

1301
01:23:01.80 --> 01:23:04.64
But I know she's going to have a conversation with dad.

1302
01:23:04.64 --> 01:23:08.000
And the conversation I figured, I kind of figured,

1303
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I said, she's going to say, hey, we have to move over there.

1304
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.20
Make sure our kid doesn't make a mistake of what I found this

1305
01:23:15.20 --> 01:23:19.60
and that's a good Catholic parents old fashioned.

1306
01:23:19.60 --> 01:23:23.000
So it worked.

1307
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.68
It worked to the tea.

1308
01:23:24.68 --> 01:23:25.60
It worked.

1309
01:23:25.60 --> 01:23:27.68
I'm next thing I know is they're packing their stuff

1310
01:23:27.68 --> 01:23:29.80
and they're moving over.

1311
01:23:29.80 --> 01:23:34.68
So yes, I did use a little bit of psychology to get them over there.

1312
01:23:34.68 --> 01:23:37.16
And we've never talked about it since then.

1313
01:23:37.16 --> 01:23:38.28
She hasn't mentioned it.

1314
01:23:38.28 --> 01:23:40.28
I've never mentioned it.

1315
01:23:40.28 --> 01:23:42.04
And it just worked.

1316
01:23:42.04 --> 01:23:43.20
It just worked.

1317
01:23:43.20 --> 01:23:44.76
It just worked.

1318
01:23:44.76 --> 01:23:47.04
Mm-hm.

1319
01:23:47.04 --> 01:23:50.12
Fast forward a little bit in 1991.

1320
01:23:50.12 --> 01:23:53.12
You lost your grandfather.

1321
01:23:53.12 --> 01:23:54.40
Yes.

1322
01:23:54.40 --> 01:23:58.28
And that was, I mean, your family was close.

1323
01:23:58.28 --> 01:24:01.000
Even though you spent less and less time in Mexico

1324
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.48
as you got older, you still, I mean, this was like a huge impact

1325
01:24:05.48 --> 01:24:06.88
for you, huge loss.

1326
01:24:06.88 --> 01:24:11.12
Yes, because I grew up as a kid, I would spend three months

1327
01:24:11.12 --> 01:24:14.40
over there in their house with them growing up with them.

1328
01:24:14.40 --> 01:24:16.32
My parents were there.

1329
01:24:16.32 --> 01:24:17.56
My siblings were there.

1330
01:24:17.56 --> 01:24:19.92
Cousins would come over.

1331
01:24:19.92 --> 01:24:23.64
But my grandfather and grandmother were there.

1332
01:24:23.64 --> 01:24:28.68
And so they were like the matriap and patriarch

1333
01:24:28.68 --> 01:24:30.48
of the family kind of thing.

1334
01:24:30.48 --> 01:24:35.44
And so it was big loss when we lost them.

1335
01:24:35.44 --> 01:24:38.88
Yeah, because then, well, you're a Braula.

1336
01:24:38.88 --> 01:24:41.32
Then surely thereafter, you say this, God must not

1337
01:24:41.32 --> 01:24:43.88
have wanted to experience such grief for too long.

1338
01:24:43.88 --> 01:24:47.32
Months after my grandfather's death, her Alzheimer's

1339
01:24:47.32 --> 01:24:50.16
rapidly accelerated and robbed her of her last memory.

1340
01:24:50.16 --> 01:24:51.60
He was not long before.

1341
01:24:51.60 --> 01:24:53.96
She reunited with her soulmate.

1342
01:24:53.96 --> 01:24:55.60
That's great.

1343
01:24:55.60 --> 01:24:59.56
And then you lost your mother's mother as well.

1344
01:24:59.56 --> 01:25:01.80
And all this happened in a pretty short period.

1345
01:25:01.80 --> 01:25:02.80
Sure.

1346
01:25:02.80 --> 01:25:05.64
About three years, I lost all three of them.

1347
01:25:05.64 --> 01:25:11.28
My grandfather on my mother's side, he passed the way

1348
01:25:11.28 --> 01:25:14.08
of tuberculosis when I was about two or three years.

1349
01:25:14.08 --> 01:25:15.52
So he got to know me.

1350
01:25:15.52 --> 01:25:16.36
I don't remember him.

1351
01:25:16.36 --> 01:25:18.32
But he got to know who I was.

1352
01:25:18.32 --> 01:25:22.16
But yeah, in the short span of those, about three years,

1353
01:25:22.16 --> 01:25:26.72
we lost all three grandparents.

1354
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:32.000
Now, as this is happening, you're still working at this lab.

1355
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.64
And while that's going on, December 8, 1991,

1356
01:25:36.64 --> 01:25:41.92
the Soviet Union falls apart, which has a fixed,

1357
01:25:41.92 --> 01:25:43.76
I mean, global effects, obviously.

1358
01:25:43.76 --> 01:25:45.48
This was a superpower.

1359
01:25:45.48 --> 01:25:48.32
This was the fall of communism.

1360
01:25:48.32 --> 01:25:50.24
And you say this in the book, it was not long

1361
01:25:50.24 --> 01:25:52.20
after the fall of the Soviet Union.

1362
01:25:52.20 --> 01:25:55.64
That is the expensive Star Wars defense programs,

1363
01:25:55.64 --> 01:25:58.64
such as our own X-ray laser program

1364
01:25:58.64 --> 01:26:01.60
came up on the Congressional Budget's chopping block.

1365
01:26:01.60 --> 01:26:02.92
Yes.

1366
01:26:02.92 --> 01:26:08.12
So you were working on things that were used for defense.

1367
01:26:08.12 --> 01:26:09.12
Yes.

1368
01:26:09.12 --> 01:26:14.56
The project I had worked, when I got hired as a career employee,

1369
01:26:14.56 --> 01:26:16.000
because I had worked at the lab already.

1370
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.76
But when I got hired as a career employee,

1371
01:26:18.76 --> 01:26:22.52
they gave me a choice of about three projects.

1372
01:26:22.52 --> 01:26:26.48
They had a life extension program

1373
01:26:26.48 --> 01:26:29.24
where they extended the life of a nuclear warhead

1374
01:26:29.24 --> 01:26:35.24
and so you worked on how to evaluate them and certify them.

1375
01:26:35.24 --> 01:26:37.88
So they can stay longer on a shelf,

1376
01:26:37.88 --> 01:26:40.80
and we call it good in good operating order.

1377
01:26:40.80 --> 01:26:41.88
That was one project.

1378
01:26:41.88 --> 01:26:45.56
The other one was working in the National Ignition Facility

1379
01:26:45.56 --> 01:26:49.88
sniff, where it's nuclear fusion, 1952, X-ray beams,

1380
01:26:49.88 --> 01:26:54.28
creating nuclear fusion to create energy, which was pretty interesting.

1381
01:26:54.28 --> 01:26:59.20
But the third one was developing an X-ray laser.

1382
01:26:59.20 --> 01:27:01.72
This is a nuclear pumped X-ray laser,

1383
01:27:01.72 --> 01:27:04.04
where you have a nuclear event,

1384
01:27:04.04 --> 01:27:09.56
and you have a beam of focus X-rays that would be

1385
01:27:09.56 --> 01:27:14.24
up deployed up in space, that would be pointed to any

1386
01:27:14.24 --> 01:27:18.000
uncoming Soviet missiles in the event of a first strike

1387
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.12
by the Russians.

1388
01:27:19.12 --> 01:27:22.08
When those missiles go X-othermic up in space,

1389
01:27:22.08 --> 01:27:26.08
you detonate this device, you have high energy X-ray particles

1390
01:27:26.08 --> 01:27:28.56
that take out the electronics package

1391
01:27:28.56 --> 01:27:31.04
and they flowed off harmously.

1392
01:27:31.04 --> 01:27:34.04
So out of all these three projects,

1393
01:27:34.04 --> 01:27:36.68
that's the one that interests me because we had to put it up

1394
01:27:36.68 --> 01:27:37.68
in space.

1395
01:27:37.68 --> 01:27:40.80
So I figured, I got to learn how to put it was hard

1396
01:27:40.80 --> 01:27:41.52
we're up in space.

1397
01:27:41.52 --> 01:27:43.08
I think NASA would be interested in this.

1398
01:27:43.08 --> 01:27:45.96
Not to mention, working on a nuclear X-ray laser.

1399
01:27:45.96 --> 01:27:46.96
Exactly.

1400
01:27:46.96 --> 01:27:47.80
Exactly.

1401
01:27:47.80 --> 01:27:50.84
And we would do our testing in Nevada,

1402
01:27:50.84 --> 01:27:53.40
the test side, this was one underground nuclear testing

1403
01:27:53.40 --> 01:27:54.44
was allowed.

1404
01:27:54.44 --> 01:27:58.08
And whenever they did an even nuclear event,

1405
01:27:59.48 --> 01:28:02.52
the labs, they would give you real estate.

1406
01:28:02.52 --> 01:28:07.36
They would have about 30 experiments in a nuclear event.

1407
01:28:07.36 --> 01:28:09.40
So they had a whole team that just dedicated

1408
01:28:09.40 --> 01:28:11.20
to preparing for a nuclear event,

1409
01:28:11.20 --> 01:28:13.44
and then they say, okay, this is your real estate,

1410
01:28:13.44 --> 01:28:15.36
and you would go down there and put your package

1411
01:28:15.36 --> 01:28:20.36
in our case, it's the X-ray itself, right next to them bomb,

1412
01:28:20.36 --> 01:28:23.64
and then bunch of diagnostics, fiber optics,

1413
01:28:23.64 --> 01:28:27.08
so that when it happens, we're able to measure the flux,

1414
01:28:27.08 --> 01:28:31.24
how strong those X-rays are, and how the density of it,

1415
01:28:31.24 --> 01:28:34.52
and all that, so we can basically measure its performance.

1416
01:28:34.52 --> 01:28:36.08
And that's what we were doing.

1417
01:28:36.08 --> 01:28:37.68
And so to me, it was great.

1418
01:28:37.68 --> 01:28:40.72
It was, and they would throw money at it.

1419
01:28:40.72 --> 01:28:42.72
So money was never an issue in terms of,

1420
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:45.08
I need this, I need that, and we would not.

1421
01:28:45.08 --> 01:28:49.44
So it was fun times until the Soviet Union collapsed,

1422
01:28:49.44 --> 01:28:53.16
and then justification for grand-eels projects,

1423
01:28:53.16 --> 01:28:55.68
and justified it to be so, went away,

1424
01:28:55.68 --> 01:28:57.48
and so that's why they canceled it.

1425
01:28:57.48 --> 01:28:59.44
Yeah, you described this well,

1426
01:28:59.44 --> 01:29:02.08
when you're talking about how much money you were able to utilize,

1427
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:04.84
you say, I credit the advances in defense shield projects,

1428
01:29:04.84 --> 01:29:06.16
such as our own X-ray laser,

1429
01:29:06.16 --> 01:29:09.20
as leading to the downfall of the former Soviet Union.

1430
01:29:09.20 --> 01:29:11.000
In short, Reagan's strategy,

1431
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.24
that's Ronald Reagan Reagan's strategy worked.

1432
01:29:13.24 --> 01:29:15.24
My own conclusion leads me to believe

1433
01:29:15.24 --> 01:29:17.92
that an effort to keep up with the Joneses,

1434
01:29:17.92 --> 01:29:20.68
the Soviet Union dedicated the bulk of its budget

1435
01:29:20.68 --> 01:29:23.32
to similar programs, while paying less attention

1436
01:29:23.32 --> 01:29:26.16
to their economy and internal infrastructure.

1437
01:29:26.16 --> 01:29:29.48
As a result, the USSR created the perfect social and

1438
01:29:29.48 --> 01:29:34.48
economic storm that led to unrest and its eventual downfall.

1439
01:29:34.48 --> 01:29:35.48
That's great.

1440
01:29:36.48 --> 01:29:37.48
Fast forward a little bit.

1441
01:29:37.48 --> 01:29:39.12
One question started to linger in my mind

1442
01:29:39.12 --> 01:29:41.04
was how could we utilize to our advantage

1443
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:43.92
the insight gathered from the work on the X-ray laser?

1444
01:29:43.92 --> 01:29:45.96
My boss and mentor, Clint Logan,

1445
01:29:45.96 --> 01:29:47.32
could not have agreed more.

1446
01:29:47.32 --> 01:29:50.72
Clint decided that mammography was the best way

1447
01:29:50.72 --> 01:29:54.72
to match both our skills and the tools we had developed.

1448
01:29:54.72 --> 01:29:56.08
That's a big leap.

1449
01:29:56.08 --> 01:29:58.000
We had, we also had personal motives

1450
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.20
for improving mammography.

1451
01:30:00.20 --> 01:30:02.80
The wife of our leader in the X-ray laser program

1452
01:30:02.80 --> 01:30:05.16
had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

1453
01:30:05.16 --> 01:30:07.92
And I had just lost a young friend to the disease.

1454
01:30:07.92 --> 01:30:10.44
On many occasions, I served as an interpreter

1455
01:30:10.44 --> 01:30:12.72
for my 28-year-old friend and her husband

1456
01:30:12.72 --> 01:30:14.92
as she underwent treatment for her cancer.

1457
01:30:14.92 --> 01:30:17.16
I was astonished to learn that eventually,

1458
01:30:17.16 --> 01:30:19.08
one in eight women in the United States

1459
01:30:19.08 --> 01:30:21.60
acquires this horrible disease.

1460
01:30:22.84 --> 01:30:26.32
So you guys figured out that some of the technology

1461
01:30:26.32 --> 01:30:28.76
that you had used or you had invented

1462
01:30:28.76 --> 01:30:31.44
could actually be used in a positive way

1463
01:30:31.44 --> 01:30:33.76
for helping detect breast cancer.

1464
01:30:33.76 --> 01:30:35.28
That's correct.

1465
01:30:35.28 --> 01:30:38.88
The area I was in charge of for the X-ray laser

1466
01:30:38.88 --> 01:30:41.68
was evaluating the man-made materials

1467
01:30:41.68 --> 01:30:46.04
called arrow gels that were used as pads

1468
01:30:46.04 --> 01:30:47.60
for the X-ray laser.

1469
01:30:47.60 --> 01:30:51.96
And the way I evaluated them was I would X-ray them

1470
01:30:51.96 --> 01:30:55.96
and create images to see how homogeneous

1471
01:30:55.96 --> 01:30:59.96
this man-made material was so that you could match it.

1472
01:30:59.96 --> 01:31:04.36
Because you had to put about eight of these type of bricks

1473
01:31:04.36 --> 01:31:05.60
on both sides.

1474
01:31:05.60 --> 01:31:07.52
And you got to match the interfaces else.

1475
01:31:07.52 --> 01:31:11.40
They lose energy as it transfers from one interface

1476
01:31:11.40 --> 01:31:12.28
to the other.

1477
01:31:12.28 --> 01:31:15.60
And the way I did it was I did X-ray imaging,

1478
01:31:15.60 --> 01:31:18.40
but then I also started to fall around

1479
01:31:18.40 --> 01:31:20.92
with how X-rays interact with matter.

1480
01:31:20.92 --> 01:31:24.60
And I started writing some code called

1481
01:31:24.60 --> 01:31:29.08
Monicarlo 3D code analysis

1482
01:31:29.08 --> 01:31:34.08
that models how the X-rays react with matter.

1483
01:31:35.04 --> 01:31:38.88
Because some X-rays go through, some get completely absorbed

1484
01:31:38.88 --> 01:31:42.40
in some collide with material and create lower energy

1485
01:31:42.40 --> 01:31:42.88
X-rays.

1486
01:31:42.88 --> 01:31:45.76
And that's gathered, which is noise in the image.

1487
01:31:45.76 --> 01:31:47.56
And so I modeled all that.

1488
01:31:47.56 --> 01:31:52.12
And when the project got canceled,

1489
01:31:52.12 --> 01:31:54.56
this was like a neat little tool.

1490
01:31:54.56 --> 01:31:59.32
And so Clint, my boss, and I felt like we had an answer,

1491
01:31:59.32 --> 01:32:01.80
but we didn't know what the question was.

1492
01:32:01.80 --> 01:32:04.84
And then when all of a sudden we got sensitized

1493
01:32:04.84 --> 01:32:06.60
to breast cancer.

1494
01:32:06.60 --> 01:32:09.80
And we said, I wonder if we can redesign

1495
01:32:09.80 --> 01:32:14.80
the mammography machines that create these images

1496
01:32:15.80 --> 01:32:19.64
because they use film and they developed a film

1497
01:32:19.64 --> 01:32:21.84
and the doctors look at that in light table.

1498
01:32:21.84 --> 01:32:26.12
What we created a electronic detector

1499
01:32:26.12 --> 01:32:29.56
and we designed the X-ray tube to be more optimal

1500
01:32:29.56 --> 01:32:32.84
for human tissue diagnosis.

1501
01:32:32.84 --> 01:32:35.24
And we were able to create the,

1502
01:32:35.24 --> 01:32:39.04
what's called the first full-field digital mammography system

1503
01:32:39.04 --> 01:32:41.12
or earlier detection of cancer earlier

1504
01:32:41.12 --> 01:32:44.24
because we demonstrated that our images

1505
01:32:44.24 --> 01:32:46.20
had much more information content

1506
01:32:46.20 --> 01:32:47.84
than the film screen images.

1507
01:32:47.84 --> 01:32:50.88
And then we opened up a whole new area of study

1508
01:32:50.88 --> 01:32:55.88
called Computer-Aided Diagnosis where we were able to basically

1509
01:32:57.32 --> 01:33:01.08
point out possible early precursors to breast cancer,

1510
01:33:01.08 --> 01:33:02.84
which are microcassifications,

1511
01:33:02.84 --> 01:33:06.000
telly, and circumscribe lesions, asymmetric,

1512
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.24
glandular distortion.

1513
01:33:07.24 --> 01:33:09.64
All those type of things that will catch the eye

1514
01:33:09.64 --> 01:33:12.56
of a radiologist and say, hey, maybe we should look here.

1515
01:33:12.56 --> 01:33:15.56
And so we put it in a smart expert system

1516
01:33:15.56 --> 01:33:18.60
so that the, you not only acquired the images,

1517
01:33:18.60 --> 01:33:21.80
but then you would put it in a super sensitive mode

1518
01:33:21.80 --> 01:33:26.04
and then outline the areas where the radiologist should focus

1519
01:33:26.04 --> 01:33:29.96
on and check out and see if it's worth going in

1520
01:33:29.96 --> 01:33:32.32
for a biopsy or doing something else to the patient.

1521
01:33:32.32 --> 01:33:33.52
So we were pretty proud.

1522
01:33:33.52 --> 01:33:35.88
I always tell people, you know,

1523
01:33:35.88 --> 01:33:39.96
when they ask me what's your proudest professional moment,

1524
01:33:39.96 --> 01:33:42.08
a lot of people expect me to say, oh, you know,

1525
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:44.64
I flew on Space Shuttle Discovery

1526
01:33:44.64 --> 01:33:47.16
and went up into Space International Space Station

1527
01:33:47.16 --> 01:33:49.52
and all that kind of stuff I was a flight engineer,

1528
01:33:49.52 --> 01:33:50.52
but that's not it.

1529
01:33:50.52 --> 01:33:53.28
It's the fact that, you know, this device

1530
01:33:53.28 --> 01:33:54.84
that we created at Lawrence,

1531
01:33:54.84 --> 01:33:58.12
Slov'em or Lab, which was a nuclear defense lab,

1532
01:33:58.12 --> 01:34:02.000
yet we repurpose that technology for something,

1533
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.96
that could work here,

1534
01:34:03.96 --> 01:34:08.96
for the civilians was developing an X-ray mammocry system

1535
01:34:10.16 --> 01:34:12.76
that detects cancer at earlier stages,

1536
01:34:12.76 --> 01:34:16.40
everybody knows that if you detect cancer at an earlier stage,

1537
01:34:16.40 --> 01:34:20.84
the greater probability of the patient to be saved occurs.

1538
01:34:20.84 --> 01:34:23.40
And so I'm convinced that this device

1539
01:34:23.40 --> 01:34:25.84
has saved hundreds of thousands of millions of life

1540
01:34:25.84 --> 01:34:29.000
since it's inception back in 97,98.

1541
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Oh, yeah, that's awesome.

1542
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.92
We could just end there, I guess, right?

1543
01:34:36.92 --> 01:34:41.92
We could just end there, but the story goes on a little bit.

1544
01:34:41.92 --> 01:34:44.40
In early 1992, when I was 29 years old,

1545
01:34:44.40 --> 01:34:47.36
I called the National Aronotics and Space Administration

1546
01:34:47.36 --> 01:34:50.84
NASA to ask about the requirements to become an astronaut.

1547
01:34:50.84 --> 01:34:52.88
I was hoping to make myself make,

1548
01:34:52.88 --> 01:34:55.08
I was hoping to make what was a far-fetched dream

1549
01:34:55.08 --> 01:34:56.88
for many a reality for myself.

1550
01:34:56.88 --> 01:34:59.24
Here were the requirements.

1551
01:34:59.24 --> 01:35:02.76
Career in a technical field or medicine check.

1552
01:35:02.76 --> 01:35:04.20
Five years experience check,

1553
01:35:04.20 --> 01:35:08.36
highly desirable, graduate degree check.

1554
01:35:08.36 --> 01:35:09.80
Nothing prevented me from applying

1555
01:35:09.80 --> 01:35:11.52
since I met all their basic requirements.

1556
01:35:11.52 --> 01:35:13.60
Hence, I decided to contact NASA.

1557
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:16.44
Much to my surprise, the main operator put me in contact

1558
01:35:16.44 --> 01:35:18.16
with astronaut selection office.

1559
01:35:18.16 --> 01:35:20.20
As part of the first step in the application process,

1560
01:35:20.20 --> 01:35:23.60
the astronaut selection office sent me a 12 page application.

1561
01:35:23.60 --> 01:35:28.24
I properly filled it out and mailed it back to NASA.

1562
01:35:28.24 --> 01:35:29.96
Fast forward a little bit.

1563
01:35:29.96 --> 01:35:32.20
I finally received a letter in the mail four months

1564
01:35:32.20 --> 01:35:34.76
after having received the acknowledgement of my application.

1565
01:35:34.76 --> 01:35:36.76
It read, thank you for your interest in NASA

1566
01:35:36.76 --> 01:35:39.72
at the moment there are many qualified applicants

1567
01:35:39.72 --> 01:35:42.000
applying for astronaut positions.

1568
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.68
With NASA, unfortunately, we cannot invite you

1569
01:35:44.68 --> 01:35:46.68
to an interview for this selection cycle.

1570
01:35:46.68 --> 01:35:50.88
We encourage you to continue applying for future selection

1571
01:35:50.88 --> 01:35:52.68
cycles.

1572
01:35:52.68 --> 01:35:55.28
So denied.

1573
01:35:55.28 --> 01:35:59.28
The first thing, meaning, you've got denied.

1574
01:35:59.28 --> 01:36:01.24
I chunk here.

1575
01:36:01.24 --> 01:36:06.48
I got to bring a delta into the story, yes, my wife.

1576
01:36:06.48 --> 01:36:10.36
And you go through a really cool story about how you met,

1577
01:36:10.36 --> 01:36:11.76
how you got together.

1578
01:36:11.76 --> 01:36:12.40
It's in the book.

1579
01:36:12.40 --> 01:36:13.84
It's great.

1580
01:36:13.84 --> 01:36:15.12
Fast forward a little bit past that.

1581
01:36:15.12 --> 01:36:16.80
It's a delta and I dated for more than two years

1582
01:36:16.80 --> 01:36:18.20
before we decided to get married.

1583
01:36:18.20 --> 01:36:20.76
We were not in any rush to tie the knot, even though we

1584
01:36:20.76 --> 01:36:24.60
knew we were meant to be together six months after we got engaged.

1585
01:36:24.60 --> 01:36:27.08
We exchanged vows in a traditional Catholic ceremony

1586
01:36:27.08 --> 01:36:30.96
in low-dye California at St. Anne's Catholic Church

1587
01:36:30.96 --> 01:36:33.80
on the way to pick up Adela, the limousine got lost

1588
01:36:33.80 --> 01:36:36.48
in constant, arrived 45 minutes late to the wedding.

1589
01:36:36.48 --> 01:36:38.20
Talk about it, nervous groom.

1590
01:36:38.20 --> 01:36:40.20
I was starting to fear she'd changed her mind.

1591
01:36:43.48 --> 01:36:44.28
True story.

1592
01:36:44.28 --> 01:36:45.28
You were sweating.

1593
01:36:45.28 --> 01:36:46.28
I was sweating, wasn't it?

1594
01:36:46.28 --> 01:36:47.24
She's bailing on you.

1595
01:36:47.24 --> 01:36:50.24
Exactly.

1596
01:36:50.24 --> 01:36:52.04
Fast forward a little bit another year past.

1597
01:36:52.04 --> 01:36:54.44
So once again, I filled out the 12-page application

1598
01:36:54.44 --> 01:36:56.04
a way to for an answer.

1599
01:36:56.04 --> 01:36:57.96
Then after four months of waiting to hear whether or not

1600
01:36:57.96 --> 01:37:01.32
I had been accepted, I received another rejection letter

1601
01:37:01.32 --> 01:37:02.80
with the words to the effect of,

1602
01:37:02.80 --> 01:37:05.32
don't call us will call you.

1603
01:37:05.32 --> 01:37:08.12
This process of applying and being rejected repeated itself

1604
01:37:08.12 --> 01:37:11.68
every year while I continue to working at the laboratory,

1605
01:37:11.68 --> 01:37:14.000
whenever I received a rejection letter from NASA,

1606
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.04
I would remind myself that there is more than just one

1607
01:37:16.04 --> 01:37:17.36
star and one goal in life.

1608
01:37:17.36 --> 01:37:20.72
I had no other choice but to move forward with my life.

1609
01:37:20.72 --> 01:37:23.60
Adelaide's positive influence helped me develop

1610
01:37:23.60 --> 01:37:25.92
a healthy balance between work and family,

1611
01:37:25.92 --> 01:37:28.000
thus I could safely avoid being consumed

1612
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.12
with the notion of trying to become an astronaut.

1613
01:37:30.12 --> 01:37:32.20
She helped me cope with NASA's rejections

1614
01:37:32.20 --> 01:37:34.16
while encouraging me to sustain my dream.

1615
01:37:35.36 --> 01:37:36.72
I still wanted to become an astronaut,

1616
01:37:36.72 --> 01:37:38.88
but I also wanted to live and enjoy my life

1617
01:37:40.28 --> 01:37:42.32
on my way to becoming one.

1618
01:37:42.32 --> 01:37:44.68
A little year, a little over a year and a half

1619
01:37:44.68 --> 01:37:47.20
into our marriage, Adela announced that she was pregnant

1620
01:37:47.20 --> 01:37:49.40
with our first child, we experienced our first pregnancy

1621
01:37:49.40 --> 01:37:51.56
with all the excitement of first time parents

1622
01:37:51.56 --> 01:37:53.28
and all the nerves too.

1623
01:37:53.28 --> 01:37:55.52
The reason I wanted to highlight that part, obviously,

1624
01:37:55.52 --> 01:37:56.92
having to baby that's awesome.

1625
01:37:56.92 --> 01:38:00.48
But also, you're gonna pursue this dream.

1626
01:38:00.48 --> 01:38:02.92
You're getting rejected from this dream,

1627
01:38:02.92 --> 01:38:05.52
but you know, you use this term here

1628
01:38:05.52 --> 01:38:07.60
that there's more than one star and more than one goal in life.

1629
01:38:07.60 --> 01:38:12.40
So even though you had this goal of becoming an astronaut,

1630
01:38:12.40 --> 01:38:16.04
you couldn't make that the be all end all.

1631
01:38:16.04 --> 01:38:18.48
I couldn't let a consumer, you know.

1632
01:38:18.48 --> 01:38:23.48
I used it as a motivator, as a driving force,

1633
01:38:23.48 --> 01:38:26.92
but I didn't want it to consume my life.

1634
01:38:26.92 --> 01:38:28.92
I wanted to enjoy life.

1635
01:38:28.92 --> 01:38:35.92
And I wanted to say, look, it's okay if you don't reach your goal

1636
01:38:37.20 --> 01:38:40.12
because as long as you give it your best,

1637
01:38:41.12 --> 01:38:42.92
it's like my father would always say,

1638
01:38:42.92 --> 01:38:46.64
you know, shoot for the stars, you know, worse that can happen

1639
01:38:46.64 --> 01:38:48.60
is you're gonna be on top of the world, you know.

1640
01:38:48.60 --> 01:38:53.000
And so that's what I was doing.

1641
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I said, you know, the fact that I was driven to become an astronaut

1642
01:38:58.72 --> 01:39:03.72
and was sort of navigating my career in that sort of way,

1643
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.52
you know, it had my career and an upward trajectory.

1644
01:39:09.52 --> 01:39:12.36
So it wasn't like they were competing priorities.

1645
01:39:12.36 --> 01:39:13.40
Yeah, well it's like your son.

1646
01:39:13.40 --> 01:39:14.04
They're complimenting.

1647
01:39:14.04 --> 01:39:14.88
It's like your son.

1648
01:39:14.88 --> 01:39:16.60
He wants to be an astronaut great.

1649
01:39:16.60 --> 01:39:19.000
Even if he doesn't get it, he's got his dang PhD.

1650
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.20
And his old master's degree.

1651
01:39:20.20 --> 01:39:21.68
He got all these doors open.

1652
01:39:21.68 --> 01:39:22.44
Exactly.

1653
01:39:22.44 --> 01:39:23.56
Exactly.

1654
01:39:23.56 --> 01:39:25.48
But that's an important thing for people to remember.

1655
01:39:25.48 --> 01:39:27.24
Like, you know, it's great to have that big goal,

1656
01:39:27.24 --> 01:39:29.48
but even if you don't make that goal, look at where you got to.

1657
01:39:29.48 --> 01:39:30.36
Exactly.

1658
01:39:30.36 --> 01:39:34.28
And sometimes you are the one that changes that.

1659
01:39:34.28 --> 01:39:35.12
Yep.

1660
01:39:35.12 --> 01:39:35.96
And I'll go.

1661
01:39:35.96 --> 01:39:36.92
It's not the fact that you can't get there.

1662
01:39:36.92 --> 01:39:40.000
Sometimes the fact that you prepare yourself a certain way

1663
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.60
opens up the doors to other opportunities

1664
01:39:42.60 --> 01:39:45.48
that you weren't even aware of, but all of a sudden,

1665
01:39:45.48 --> 01:39:46.76
hey, I can do this.

1666
01:39:46.76 --> 01:39:49.12
Now, go ahead and do it.

1667
01:39:49.12 --> 01:39:51.44
If that's what you want to do,

1668
01:39:51.44 --> 01:39:52.32
go ahead and do it.

1669
01:39:52.32 --> 01:39:55.60
It's okay to change midway as long as you're going out.

1670
01:39:55.60 --> 01:39:57.60
Yeah.

1671
01:39:57.60 --> 01:40:00.68
Fast forward a little bit during a Dallas pregnancy

1672
01:40:00.68 --> 01:40:02.32
with our second child.

1673
01:40:02.32 --> 01:40:05.16
I was traveling extensively to the former Soviet Union

1674
01:40:05.16 --> 01:40:07.24
for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

1675
01:40:07.24 --> 01:40:09.80
in the U.S. Department of Energy.

1676
01:40:09.80 --> 01:40:11.12
As luck would have it,

1677
01:40:11.12 --> 01:40:14.000
I would found out while I was still in Siberia

1678
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.48
that Adela had gone into labor,

1679
01:40:15.48 --> 01:40:18.04
given birth to our baby girl.

1680
01:40:18.04 --> 01:40:19.68
That's right.

1681
01:40:20.68 --> 01:40:21.76
I'm fast forward a little bit.

1682
01:40:21.76 --> 01:40:23.08
During one of my trips to Russia,

1683
01:40:23.08 --> 01:40:24.68
I came to an important conclusion.

1684
01:40:24.68 --> 01:40:28.44
Nothing in life happens or is accomplished purely by chance.

1685
01:40:28.44 --> 01:40:29.88
Goals and dreams are realized

1686
01:40:29.88 --> 01:40:32.20
through planning, perseverance, and hard work.

1687
01:40:32.20 --> 01:40:35.08
As I was leaning my head against the window of the state-owned car

1688
01:40:35.08 --> 01:40:36.60
that was taking us to our hotel,

1689
01:40:36.60 --> 01:40:39.08
I thought of how my childhood dream had evolved

1690
01:40:39.08 --> 01:40:40.84
with my graduation from college

1691
01:40:40.84 --> 01:40:43.32
and my work at one of the most prestigious laboratories

1692
01:40:43.32 --> 01:40:45.56
in the United States and the world.

1693
01:40:45.56 --> 01:40:47.96
It was because I worked tirelessly

1694
01:40:47.96 --> 01:40:51.40
that I could see my transformative effect

1695
01:40:51.40 --> 01:40:56.20
that my dream had on shaping each outcome in my life.

1696
01:40:56.20 --> 01:40:59.56
I also focused on bettering my physical strength and health,

1697
01:40:59.56 --> 01:41:02.52
because astronauts are susceptible to rigorous training

1698
01:41:02.52 --> 01:41:05.16
and medical exams before blasting off into space.

1699
01:41:05.16 --> 01:41:07.96
I ran a marathon almost every year I applied to NASA

1700
01:41:07.96 --> 01:41:09.88
with the exception of the year that I was finally selected

1701
01:41:09.88 --> 01:41:11.80
to become a member of the astronaut class.

1702
01:41:11.80 --> 01:41:14.28
Little did I know at the time I began this routine

1703
01:41:14.28 --> 01:41:17.40
that it would mean I would end up running 11 marathons.

1704
01:41:17.40 --> 01:41:19.48
Additionally, I took up flying lessons

1705
01:41:19.48 --> 01:41:21.72
at the Tracy Municipal Airport

1706
01:41:21.72 --> 01:41:23.72
and obtained my scuba certification

1707
01:41:23.72 --> 01:41:26.76
through the laboratories scuba diving club.

1708
01:41:27.80 --> 01:41:30.68
These were skills I suspected and later confirmed

1709
01:41:30.68 --> 01:41:33.80
were indispensable to have for an astronaut.

1710
01:41:33.80 --> 01:41:36.04
I learned many things during the time I spent

1711
01:41:36.04 --> 01:41:38.52
enhancing my skill sets, but above all,

1712
01:41:38.52 --> 01:41:40.60
I learned that patience really is a virtue

1713
01:41:40.60 --> 01:41:43.24
and it is simply the best tool to have in one's toolbox

1714
01:41:43.24 --> 01:41:44.28
when learning something new.

1715
01:41:45.08 --> 01:41:47.88
So you're doing everything you can, learn it in a fly,

1716
01:41:47.88 --> 01:41:50.28
learn it in a scuba dive, getting an awesome shape,

1717
01:41:50.28 --> 01:41:51.64
running marathons.

1718
01:41:51.64 --> 01:41:53.96
Yeah, and I have to, you know,

1719
01:41:53.96 --> 01:41:56.92
I got to give more credit to my wife,

1720
01:41:56.92 --> 01:42:03.24
I'll delete that, because I remember, once the,

1721
01:42:03.24 --> 01:42:09.000
I got rejected the sixth time and I had,

1722
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.96
I had gotten the rejection letter and I even scrunched it up

1723
01:42:13.96 --> 01:42:18.44
and kind of, I was in the bathroom shaving when I got an open it

1724
01:42:18.44 --> 01:42:21.16
and I threw in the garbage kind and I missed the can.

1725
01:42:21.16 --> 01:42:26.04
Oh, and fell on the floor and I was so pissed off, I didn't rage.

1726
01:42:26.04 --> 01:42:29.64
I didn't even pick it up, I said, heck of that.

1727
01:42:29.64 --> 01:42:34.12
And my wife, I guess, was cleaning up that day

1728
01:42:34.12 --> 01:42:35.64
and she saw the piece of paper,

1729
01:42:35.64 --> 01:42:39.000
had it landed in the garbage can, she wouldn't have picked it up

1730
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.04
and opened it, but it was on the floor, so she had, oh, what's this?

1731
01:42:42.04 --> 01:42:45.16
And she sees that it's another rejection letter and she sees it scrunched up,

1732
01:42:45.16 --> 01:42:47.88
so she's putting two and two to the, she's a pretty bright girl, so,

1733
01:42:47.88 --> 01:42:50.20
so she's, she knows I'm giving up.

1734
01:42:51.24 --> 01:42:54.92
And, and so she goes and she shows me the, the letter,

1735
01:42:54.92 --> 01:42:56.04
she says, what's this?

1736
01:42:56.04 --> 01:43:01.000
I said, you know, they keep saying that over 12,000 people apply

1737
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.96
for only 10, 12 positions, I said, and man, they rejected me,

1738
01:43:05.96 --> 01:43:07.56
this is the sixth time they rejected me.

1739
01:43:08.36 --> 01:43:10.20
I said, I think I'm gonna give up.

1740
01:43:10.20 --> 01:43:15.000
I said, this, enough enough, I said, look, I got my graduate degree,

1741
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.96
I work at the lab and all that and then she says,

1742
01:43:17.96 --> 01:43:21.32
so you're gonna settle for that, that, what you're gonna settle for,

1743
01:43:21.32 --> 01:43:22.52
she got you.

1744
01:43:22.52 --> 01:43:26.84
And then she not only said that, but then she said, you're gonna settle for that

1745
01:43:26.84 --> 01:43:27.56
and you're a quitter.

1746
01:43:28.76 --> 01:43:30.92
That's what got me, when she said, I'm a quitter.

1747
01:43:30.92 --> 01:43:32.36
I said, no, I'm not a quitter.

1748
01:43:33.08 --> 01:43:35.16
I said, look, you're giving up.

1749
01:43:36.52 --> 01:43:40.20
And she, and she looked at me and she says, you know, you better think about this,

1750
01:43:40.20 --> 01:43:44.76
because I know you, she says, if you give up,

1751
01:43:46.20 --> 01:43:47.88
you're always gonna wonder what if,

1752
01:43:47.88 --> 01:43:53.32
what if I had put on that, put in that seventh, eighth or ninth application.

1753
01:43:53.88 --> 01:43:59.16
And that's gonna naïve from the inside and you're gonna grow to be a bitter old man

1754
01:43:59.72 --> 01:44:02.44
and I don't want to be married to a bitter old man.

1755
01:44:02.44 --> 01:44:03.80
So you better think about this.

1756
01:44:04.52 --> 01:44:08.52
And that's when she got me thinking, I said, you know, she's, she's right.

1757
01:44:09.48 --> 01:44:15.16
And so what I did, what I did was that's when I started doing the things that you just

1758
01:44:15.16 --> 01:44:23.32
mentioned there, what I did was I, I sat down and I asked myself a fundamental question.

1759
01:44:23.32 --> 01:44:28.84
I said, what do these guys have that are getting selected that I don't have?

1760
01:44:30.68 --> 01:44:36.36
And that's when I noticed that well, they have the same education.

1761
01:44:36.36 --> 01:44:39.08
They're about the same age, similar experience.

1762
01:44:39.40 --> 01:44:40.84
But then I took a deeper dive.

1763
01:44:40.84 --> 01:44:47.16
And that's when I found out that they were all pilots.

1764
01:44:47.88 --> 01:44:50.52
So that's when I invested in my sauce, I'm gonna become a pilot.

1765
01:44:51.08 --> 01:44:54.92
And then another year, I found out that they were all scuba diver rated.

1766
01:44:54.92 --> 01:44:59.08
So man, I would drive from there, stalked in the Monterey California every weekend.

1767
01:44:59.08 --> 01:45:04.20
I got basic, I got advanced, I got scuba rescue master certified.

1768
01:45:04.20 --> 01:45:06.44
I want to make sure that's a new I knew I had a scuba dive.

1769
01:45:06.44 --> 01:45:12.68
So I got those under my belt and then the opportunity came full circle.

1770
01:45:12.68 --> 01:45:13.96
You said I was in Siberia.

1771
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:18.20
The opportunity came full circle to work with the Russians.

1772
01:45:18.20 --> 01:45:19.96
Remember before I was working against the Russians,

1773
01:45:19.96 --> 01:45:23.72
protect us against the Russians now that the Soviet Union broke up,

1774
01:45:23.72 --> 01:45:27.56
they were asking for help to take control of their nuclear stockpile,

1775
01:45:27.56 --> 01:45:29.72
the newly formed Russian Federation.

1776
01:45:30.44 --> 01:45:35.40
And no one wanted to go and help the Russians because from the labs,

1777
01:45:35.40 --> 01:45:36.84
because it was tough duty.

1778
01:45:36.84 --> 01:45:40.20
You had to travel five, six times a year, three weeks at a time.

1779
01:45:40.92 --> 01:45:41.88
Just Siberia.

1780
01:45:41.88 --> 01:45:43.48
Two Siberian ballplaces.

1781
01:45:43.48 --> 01:45:47.96
You think you take that 13-hour trip to Moscow.

1782
01:45:48.84 --> 01:45:53.72
From New York, this is after taking a five-hour trip to San Francisco,

1783
01:45:53.72 --> 01:45:54.20
to New York.

1784
01:45:54.20 --> 01:45:56.04
Then you take that 13-hour trip to Moscow.

1785
01:45:56.04 --> 01:45:57.08
You think you're there.

1786
01:45:57.08 --> 01:45:59.80
You still got another six and a half hour flight into Siberia.

1787
01:45:59.80 --> 01:46:03.08
You know, I talked about being in the middle of nowhere.

1788
01:46:03.08 --> 01:46:06.60
And no one wanted to do it, but man,

1789
01:46:07.24 --> 01:46:10.52
I raised my hand and I told my boss put me in coach, I'll go.

1790
01:46:12.12 --> 01:46:15.40
And I said, but there's only one condition I put.

1791
01:46:15.40 --> 01:46:16.28
He said, what's that?

1792
01:46:16.84 --> 01:46:22.28
He said, well, I wanted one Russian language instructor,

1793
01:46:22.28 --> 01:46:23.48
because I want to learn Russian.

1794
01:46:24.36 --> 01:46:27.16
Because if I'm going to be doing this for a long time,

1795
01:46:27.16 --> 01:46:28.92
I think I shouldn't know the language.

1796
01:46:28.92 --> 01:46:30.68
So yeah, we got to continue education,

1797
01:46:30.68 --> 01:46:33.08
because you're not going to be so proud.

1798
01:46:33.08 --> 01:46:34.68
So I did that.

1799
01:46:34.68 --> 01:46:37.48
And I didn't do it because I wanted to get to know Siberia

1800
01:46:37.48 --> 01:46:40.04
in the middle of the winter, but I did it because I had

1801
01:46:40.04 --> 01:46:43.24
read in a newspaper that the US and Russia

1802
01:46:43.24 --> 01:46:46.44
were going to start working in the space program together.

1803
01:46:46.44 --> 01:46:48.44
And so I kind of put two and two together.

1804
01:46:48.44 --> 01:46:50.84
And I said, hey, we're going to be working with the Russians up in space.

1805
01:46:50.84 --> 01:46:53.32
So this is my differentiator.

1806
01:46:53.32 --> 01:46:56.60
This is what's going to differentiate me from the 10,000 other

1807
01:46:56.60 --> 01:46:58.44
at 12,000 other applicants.

1808
01:46:58.44 --> 01:47:02.28
Is that how many are going to be able to say they go to Russia?

1809
01:47:02.28 --> 01:47:03.40
They work with the Russians.

1810
01:47:03.40 --> 01:47:05.64
They happen to Maya Parruskiyatika.

1811
01:47:05.64 --> 01:47:07.000
That's the Russian.

1812
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
You know, those type of things.

1813
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.36
And so that's what when finally things got going.

1814
01:47:12.36 --> 01:47:18.36
And all thanks to Adelita's prodding of me and,

1815
01:47:18.36 --> 01:47:22.68
and getting to my pride and saying, hey, don't be a quarter.

1816
01:47:22.68 --> 01:47:23.24
Gotta think.

1817
01:47:25.64 --> 01:47:27.88
Meanwhile, it's not only she working

1818
01:47:27.88 --> 01:47:31.80
with psychological warfare on US, a little more after this is back to the book,

1819
01:47:31.80 --> 01:47:36.20
a little more after our second child, Carina joined our family, my wife,

1820
01:47:36.20 --> 01:47:39.96
and I found out we'd be once again, bring a life into the world.

1821
01:47:39.96 --> 01:47:43.000
And then halfway through my drive, fast forward, halfway through my drive,

1822
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.44
the hospital, I received a call from my mother,

1823
01:47:44.44 --> 01:47:46.60
tell me to slow down and drive carefully as the new baby

1824
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:47.96
and its mother were doing fine.

1825
01:47:50.36 --> 01:47:52.12
Mr. Notherb Earth.

1826
01:47:52.12 --> 01:47:53.56
Yeah.

1827
01:47:53.56 --> 01:47:58.20
Believe me, I never hear the end of it, especially from the kids.

1828
01:47:58.20 --> 01:48:01.40
My family and I began to prepare to move to Washington.

1829
01:48:01.40 --> 01:48:03.64
So you got a job offer up in Washington.

1830
01:48:03.64 --> 01:48:07.88
It's the same job from the lab, but working at DOE headquarters,

1831
01:48:07.88 --> 01:48:09.48
department of energy headquarters.

1832
01:48:09.48 --> 01:48:11.96
I started thinking about the years,

1833
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:23.48
NASA denied my admission into their training program, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997.

1834
01:48:23.48 --> 01:48:28.04
Right before we left for Washington to start my two-year assignment,

1835
01:48:28.04 --> 01:48:30.44
NASA finally called offering me the invitation,

1836
01:48:30.44 --> 01:48:34.12
I've been waiting for my entire life, the person on the phone informed me that

1837
01:48:34.12 --> 01:48:39.80
out of more than 4,000 applicants, only 300 were selected for a closer look at their applications.

1838
01:48:39.80 --> 01:48:44.04
Out of those 300 candidates, only 100 were selected to continue

1839
01:48:44.04 --> 01:48:47.72
onto the final round of the selection process, and I was one of them.

1840
01:48:49.32 --> 01:48:51.80
We, the finalists were placed in a conference room,

1841
01:48:51.80 --> 01:48:57.16
where the astronaut selection manager Duane Ross explained what we would be doing during our

1842
01:48:57.16 --> 01:49:01.32
weeklong stay. He informed us that we were the third group of 20 candidates,

1843
01:49:01.32 --> 01:49:05.32
and that two more groups were visiting the Johnson Space Center in the coming weeks.

1844
01:49:05.32 --> 01:49:10.20
The purpose of our extensive exams was to help determine whether we met the medical requirements

1845
01:49:10.20 --> 01:49:14.84
for a flight assignment of the 100 finalist interviewed,

1846
01:49:14.84 --> 01:49:18.68
only 10 to 18 would be selected to become astronauts.

1847
01:49:18.68 --> 01:49:24.52
So this time you made it, little closer, little closer, little closer,

1848
01:49:24.52 --> 01:49:28.28
down to the final 100, exactly, from the thousands to the 100.

1849
01:49:28.28 --> 01:49:32.68
And they're doing medical exams, you're, you do any testing like physical testing?

1850
01:49:32.68 --> 01:49:39.40
Yeah, yes, they do everything from physical testing to psychological testing,

1851
01:49:39.40 --> 01:49:45.08
aptitude testing, and then they culminate everything with our long interview with the

1852
01:49:45.08 --> 01:49:50.36
whole selection committee. This, I was thinking this has to be the most highly screen job in the

1853
01:49:50.36 --> 01:49:56.52
world. This one of them. I can't imagine there's, I mean, I guess maybe the present United States,

1854
01:49:56.52 --> 01:50:01.16
although that's questionable, because they get elected. Yeah, they're getting elected. Yeah,

1855
01:50:01.16 --> 01:50:07.56
I can't imagine a more highly screened job than being an astronaut. I mean, just this,

1856
01:50:07.56 --> 01:50:12.12
the course, and again, there's a lot of good details you put in the book about this by the book.

1857
01:50:12.12 --> 01:50:16.12
Um, you talk about some of the stories of the other 19 individuals were truly amazing,

1858
01:50:16.12 --> 01:50:18.84
some were military test pilots. I thought we're helicopter pilots,

1859
01:50:18.84 --> 01:50:22.84
still others were medical doctors while the rest were engineers and scientists.

1860
01:50:28.12 --> 01:50:32.04
Eventually, Duane Ross called and gave me the news. Jose, thank you for your interest in

1861
01:50:32.04 --> 01:50:36.52
our program. Unfortunately, you are not selected in this interview cycle. We encourage you to

1862
01:50:36.52 --> 01:50:43.64
keep in mind. So close. As we'll be selecting future classes. But wait, there's more. Duane Ross

1863
01:50:43.64 --> 01:50:47.32
continued the phone conversation and said, Jose, if you're interested, we would like to offer you a

1864
01:50:47.32 --> 01:50:52.36
position as an engineer here at NASA, Johnson Space Center. However, this does not guarantee that

1865
01:50:52.36 --> 01:50:56.52
you will be interviewed, let alone selected during the next selection cycle. If you are interested in

1866
01:50:56.52 --> 01:51:00.76
applying to become an astronaut, we suggest you get more operations experience, and we believe

1867
01:51:00.76 --> 01:51:05.96
you can gain this type of experience and knowledge here at NASA. So they gave you a job offer,

1868
01:51:05.96 --> 01:51:11.40
which I was surprised when I read this. You didn't take it. Exactly. Explain why you didn't take it.

1869
01:51:11.40 --> 01:51:19.64
I did not take it because I had just arrived to Washington DC on my change of station

1870
01:51:19.64 --> 01:51:27.08
assignment from Lawrence, Livermore Lab. The lab had spent about $25,000 moving my family and I.

1871
01:51:27.08 --> 01:51:34.04
We had a house rented and everything, a lease signed with the job was paying for it,

1872
01:51:34.04 --> 01:51:41.88
but I was working at DOE headquarters, that down in downtown Washington DC. I had a commitment for

1873
01:51:41.88 --> 01:51:47.88
two years, and I couldn't in good conscience after being there a couple of months, saying, well,

1874
01:51:47.88 --> 01:51:52.52
I changed my mind. Thanks for spending that $25,000. I'm going to Houston now. I didn't want

1875
01:51:52.52 --> 01:51:57.96
to burn any bridges or, well, not that it was burning bridges, but more than it wasn't the right

1876
01:51:57.96 --> 01:52:07.16
thing to do. I had made a commitment and I wanted to fulfill it. I gave Duane Ross a call and I told

1877
01:52:07.16 --> 01:52:14.60
that I respectfully have to decline the offer, but I gave him my story. This is why I feel I cannot

1878
01:52:14.60 --> 01:52:21.32
do it and he understood. I figured he, I'm never going to hear from him again because I turned

1879
01:52:21.32 --> 01:52:29.08
him down, but I long behold, following a couple of years, they call again. 1992, once again, renewed my

1880
01:52:29.08 --> 01:52:35.08
application. By now, I felt I could fill it out with my eyes closed. For the second time, I was one of

1881
01:52:35.08 --> 01:52:39.72
the hundred last hundred finalists, just like the time before these lucky 100 were inviting

1882
01:52:39.72 --> 01:52:43.72
groups of 20 to spend a week, go through a series of medical and psychological exams interviews

1883
01:52:43.72 --> 01:52:49.32
and towards the various training facilities. When NASA decides to let the hundred individuals know

1884
01:52:49.32 --> 01:52:54.36
whether they've been selected or not, the calls to all 100 people occur within the span of a few

1885
01:52:54.36 --> 01:52:59.80
hours. It was rumored that if a candidate picked up the phone and the Johnson Space Center director,

1886
01:53:00.36 --> 01:53:05.88
who was George Abbey at the time was on the other end, it would be good news. However, it was the

1887
01:53:06.60 --> 01:53:12.12
astronaut selection manager, Duane Ross, or any other interview panel member, one could almost

1888
01:53:12.12 --> 01:53:17.16
guarantee you would be a thanks but try again, type a call. True to the rumor, when I received the

1889
01:53:17.16 --> 01:53:21.64
call from Duane, it was to tell me that I had been seriously considered, but it was not my year.

1890
01:53:22.20 --> 01:53:29.32
He then went on to suggest that again, I consider an engineering position at Johnson Space Center.

1891
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.84
So then you go and talk to your wife, Adelita. Say, man, I talked to you for a moment. She said,

1892
01:53:36.84 --> 01:53:40.28
of course, something wrong. You said, I want to talk to you about something really important. I have

1893
01:53:40.28 --> 01:53:44.60
the thought about the whole situation with NASA a lot, but before we finalize our decision,

1894
01:53:44.60 --> 01:53:47.80
I want to confirm something with you. We are getting ready to head back to California and I'm

1895
01:53:47.80 --> 01:53:53.08
probably going to get a promotion in a nice race when I report back to work at the laboratory. That said,

1896
01:53:53.08 --> 01:53:57.08
I think it is best job. I think it's best for me to turn down the job offer with Nasa,

1897
01:53:57.08 --> 01:54:01.08
because they offered you another job. Yes. Houston is hot and muggy anyways. We'll have

1898
01:54:01.08 --> 01:54:06.92
less money to spend and Adelita interrupted me. Honey, if moving to Houston and working for NASA

1899
01:54:06.92 --> 01:54:11.64
as an engineer is what it will take to for you to make your dream come true, then we'll move to

1900
01:54:11.64 --> 01:54:18.52
Houston in a heartbeat boom. Yeah. And that was the deal. Yeah. So now you now you accept the job

1901
01:54:20.52 --> 01:54:26.52
at NASA as an engineer, as an engineer. Not as an astronaut. I'm still really cool. Yeah. I'm

1902
01:54:26.52 --> 01:54:35.88
in engineering and low man on the totem boom. On January 21st, 2003, we welcomed our fifth child,

1903
01:54:35.88 --> 01:54:43.80
second baby boy into the world. A few days earlier on January 16th, 2003 at 939 AM, the space shuttle

1904
01:54:43.80 --> 01:54:49.72
Columbia took off for its scheduled mission with seven astronauts on board. Columbia was scheduled

1905
01:54:49.72 --> 01:54:58.04
to land back on Earth on February 1st, 2003 at 715 AM. The orbital maneuvering system engines were

1906
01:54:58.04 --> 01:55:04.76
turned on for a D orbit burn. This burn allows the atmosphere to capture the space shuttle

1907
01:55:04.76 --> 01:55:12.36
Columbia and thus begin its reentry to Earth. Within minutes, the temperature center on the left

1908
01:55:12.36 --> 01:55:18.12
wings breaks began to show an increase in temperature. It was the first serious indication that

1909
01:55:18.12 --> 01:55:25.56
something was wrong. At 759 AM, the last words from the space shuttle Columbia were transmitted,

1910
01:55:25.56 --> 01:55:32.84
understood, but three minutes later, Columbia broke apart, raining a field of debris

1911
01:55:32.84 --> 01:55:50.76
across the northwest parts of Texas and Louisiana. You use a term in here. It's normalization

1912
01:55:50.76 --> 01:55:59.08
of deviation. And I started thinking about that term and what it means and how it obviously

1913
01:55:59.08 --> 01:56:05.16
impacted this horrible incident with losing the space shuttle Columbia. But it seems like something

1914
01:56:05.16 --> 01:56:10.60
that we are mistaken that we can do in our own lives. This normalization of deviation. Can you

1915
01:56:10.60 --> 01:56:15.80
talk about that a little bit? What caused the accident and what? How that idea of normalization of

1916
01:56:15.80 --> 01:56:22.76
deviation played into it? Sure. By that time I had been there for three years at NASA and I worked

1917
01:56:22.76 --> 01:56:30.36
myself up to branch chief of the materials and processes branch. And this is the engineering branch

1918
01:56:30.36 --> 01:56:41.24
that does the failure analysis and finds out root causes of failures of materials. And so when the

1919
01:56:42.68 --> 01:56:50.28
base shuttle disintegrated up in Northwest Texas, Louisiana, my group was one of the first groups

1920
01:56:50.28 --> 01:56:56.44
that were out there picking up the pieces. We were the ones that put the hanger and floored

1921
01:56:56.44 --> 01:57:03.32
outline the shuttle and brought every piece and forensic evidence and put it all together and

1922
01:57:03.32 --> 01:57:10.12
did the testing in terms of the materials to find out where the breach occurred. And once we were

1923
01:57:10.12 --> 01:57:14.76
pretty certain that that's where the breach occurred, which is an left wing leading edge, which is a

1924
01:57:14.76 --> 01:57:23.24
reinforced carbon carbon substrate, hard substrate. We went to Southwest Research in San Antonio

1925
01:57:23.24 --> 01:57:30.84
and we built a full size wing of the shuttle and then we looked at the images analysis and saw

1926
01:57:30.84 --> 01:57:38.36
pieces of foam that fell from the tank insulation that big orange tank center tank that fell and hit

1927
01:57:38.36 --> 01:57:45.56
the left wing leading edge. We found out we calculated the speed, the size of it and we replicated

1928
01:57:45.56 --> 01:57:52.12
that experiment at Southwest Research through a air gun fired that those pieces of foam to the wing

1929
01:57:52.12 --> 01:57:59.48
leading edge and recreated basically the cracks that occurred because that's the material that helps

1930
01:57:59.48 --> 01:58:09.88
on reentry you're up to about 2700 degrees and you know the aluminum structure inside it's

1931
01:58:09.88 --> 01:58:15.88
aluminum melts at about 900 degrees or so. So if there's a crack in there it's going to get in there

1932
01:58:15.88 --> 01:58:22.04
and it's going to affect the structural integrity of the wing and that's what caused it to snap

1933
01:58:22.04 --> 01:58:33.48
and create that catastrophic failure and pieces all over Northwest Texas occurred and so so during

1934
01:58:33.48 --> 01:58:42.60
all this time you know the president had the Columbia accident investigation board or board

1935
01:58:42.60 --> 01:58:51.40
form and since I was the branch chief I gave a lot of briefings of the findings you know there's

1936
01:58:51.40 --> 01:58:57.56
a whole team's hundreds of hundreds of people that contributed certainly not me myself but I was one of

1937
01:58:57.56 --> 01:59:04.20
the spokespeople in terms of telling the science part of it the results of how we what we measured

1938
01:59:04.20 --> 01:59:10.92
and all that and and so I got a lot of face time with a lot of people at NASA and they ended up you

1939
01:59:10.92 --> 01:59:17.72
know they started looking at me and trusting me and all that that that you know we came up with the

1940
01:59:17.72 --> 01:59:22.60
with the story of how what was the root cause of the failure which is of course the piece of

1941
01:59:22.60 --> 01:59:27.64
foam that did and but shortly thereafter the following year they have a selection

1942
01:59:29.72 --> 01:59:35.96
a selection of astronauts and I'm again one of the finalists and this time when I sit down

1943
01:59:35.96 --> 01:59:42.28
across the 18 people there are there you know I know more than half of them through this

1944
01:59:42.28 --> 01:59:48.76
accident investigation board Franklin Zhang Diaz is sitting there he's one of the guys so it's kind

1945
01:59:48.76 --> 01:59:55.08
of like I come home to family now before it was a complete set of strangers and now everybody

1946
01:59:55.08 --> 02:00:01.000
knew me I knew them and I think my work spoke for itself and I and I think that's what finally

1947
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.60
did it but unfortunately you know we had to lose this patient of that to occur I mean then it's kind

1948
02:00:06.60 --> 02:00:14.60
of like a bittersweet moment for me with the normalization of deviation it explained with that

1949
02:00:14.60 --> 02:00:20.52
that term it's like where something goes a little bit wrong and you go you know what it's not that

1950
02:00:20.52 --> 02:00:27.08
big of a deal it's a normalization of of of this yes yes what happened was in in in in that sense

1951
02:00:27.08 --> 02:00:37.08
we've had debris fall off the tank in the past and our engineers would cry wolf

1952
02:00:37.08 --> 02:00:42.68
they would say hey something happened hearing we don't know what's going to happen on reentry

1953
02:00:42.68 --> 02:00:48.36
and you know they would do that three or four times and you did see pieces but it didn't hit anything

1954
02:00:49.72 --> 02:00:55.16
and so everybody so so wait so they weren't really crying wolf they were actually saying

1955
02:00:55.16 --> 02:01:01.64
this could cause a problem but nothing ever bad happened exactly it's nothing ever bad happened but

1956
02:01:01.64 --> 02:01:09.16
but but the fact is the fact is that when they cried wolf when it really did happen because they

1957
02:01:09.16 --> 02:01:18.92
had normalized that occurrence then the powers to be didn't put enough weight behind it to say

1958
02:01:18.92 --> 02:01:25.40
let's stop and let's go out do an EVA and let's inspect the wing leading edge where it hit

1959
02:01:25.40 --> 02:01:31.000
because that should have been the proper response all right and and that didn't happen

1960
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.72
and so that's why I call it normalization of deviation yeah and it seems like

1961
02:01:35.72 --> 02:01:40.20
well the way I thought about that after reading it was thinking about just us as human beings

1962
02:01:40.20 --> 02:01:43.96
and our lives and we make a little mistake but we get away with it right and then you

1963
02:01:43.96 --> 02:01:48.68
or you go you do something that you know you shouldn't do but you get away with it you don't

1964
02:01:48.68 --> 02:01:53.96
you know you go need a donut well you know that's just being donut and you look up in a

1965
02:01:53.96 --> 02:01:57.88
month and you've had a bunch of donuts and all of a sudden you got a problem you got five pounds on

1966
02:01:57.88 --> 02:02:06.84
you right so we got to be careful of that idea what a travesty that was um to get to that point

1967
02:02:06.84 --> 02:02:10.76
you were just talking about in the fall of 2003 the selection process for the next wave of

1968
02:02:10.76 --> 02:02:17.80
hopeful astronauts opened once again I turned my updated application the fact that I work for NASA

1969
02:02:17.80 --> 02:02:22.60
did not guarantee my acceptance and they made sure I understood that when I accepted the job at

1970
02:02:22.60 --> 02:02:29.80
NASA in 2001 working it this is this is a beautiful point although I was anxious for the selection

1971
02:02:29.80 --> 02:02:34.04
process to begin I can honestly say I was content and that piece with where I was in life

1972
02:02:34.04 --> 02:02:38.44
if I was not selected to travel into space I would accept that since I was happy working with

1973
02:02:38.44 --> 02:02:44.60
NASA working at NASA made me realize that space flight involves tens of thousands of people and

1974
02:02:44.60 --> 02:02:50.68
that every single person is as important to the success of the mission as the seven crew members

1975
02:02:50.68 --> 02:02:58.20
aboard the space shuttle so you realize that and that was a yeah I worked in the trenches with

1976
02:02:58.20 --> 02:03:05.64
everybody and so I had the opportunity to appreciate what um with the dedication of everybody

1977
02:03:05.64 --> 02:03:13.40
because you know when I went to work there you know I took a 10% pay cut from Lawrence Lvmour lab

1978
02:03:13.40 --> 02:03:19.72
because I made too much money at the lab so you know that that was one part of my hesitation

1979
02:03:19.72 --> 02:03:23.32
of accepting the job that my wife convinced me and said they don't worry about it what

1980
02:03:23.32 --> 02:03:31.56
will make it happen and so so so from that perspective you know that's the the point

1981
02:03:31.56 --> 02:03:38.44
I'm getting at is that the people that work there can make more money elsewhere but they love

1982
02:03:38.44 --> 02:03:46.12
their job and they're doing everything possible and it only took me you know when I when I was

1983
02:03:46.12 --> 02:03:52.04
part of the whole process of the accident investigation and I saw the dedication of everybody

1984
02:03:52.04 --> 02:03:57.96
and in in previous to that when we were preparing for launches I saw the dedication of people

1985
02:03:57.96 --> 02:04:03.96
during their normal activities and so a lot of people always told me when I got selected in

1986
02:04:03.96 --> 02:04:10.44
to down the floor they said you crazy I said the base shuttle just disintegrated last year and

1987
02:04:10.44 --> 02:04:15.56
you just got selected aren't you afraid and I said no so because I know these people

1988
02:04:15.56 --> 02:04:20.68
I know there you know it's tens of thousands that we depend on but I know they're here

1989
02:04:20.68 --> 02:04:26.04
because they want to be here you know they're gonna dot their eyes and cross their T's

1990
02:04:26.04 --> 02:04:30.84
because these are dedicated folks I mean I had first-hand working with them in the trenches

1991
02:04:30.84 --> 02:04:38.36
and I know their dedication so I was a piece of my when I jumped into my space I was I was

1992
02:04:38.36 --> 02:04:40.68
more than confident things were gonna turn out good

1993
02:04:46.12 --> 02:04:51.08
when going for going fast forward a little bit when the whole interview process ended I along

1994
02:04:51.08 --> 02:04:57.88
with 99 other aspiring individuals had nothing to do but wait about four months later I received

1995
02:04:57.88 --> 02:05:02.44
a telephone call while working in my office frankly I was prepared for the response that I knew

1996
02:05:02.44 --> 02:05:09.08
all too well however this particular call did not come from the center director or the astronaut

1997
02:05:09.08 --> 02:05:15.40
selection manager Duane Ross it came from a senior manager Colonel Bob Cabana who is in charge

1998
02:05:15.40 --> 02:05:22.44
of the flight crew operations director it and who is an astronaut himself I knew that if the

1999
02:05:22.44 --> 02:05:27.16
center director was calling it was sure to be good news when somebody on the recommendation board

2000
02:05:27.16 --> 02:05:32.84
like Bob was calling I really did not know what to think I was puzzled he started the conversation

2001
02:05:32.84 --> 02:05:38.44
with the usual salutations and then went on to ask if I thought I was replaceable as head of the

2002
02:05:38.44 --> 02:05:44.44
materials and process branch my response was genuine when I told them that I thought everyone was

2003
02:05:44.44 --> 02:05:50.52
replaceable and that all along I had taken upon myself the responsibility to mentor and train

2004
02:05:50.52 --> 02:05:56.76
folks to be ready to take my place good he said how would you like to come work for the astronaut

2005
02:05:56.76 --> 02:06:03.56
office I quickly realized I had been accepted my whole body went numb the second I heard the good news

2006
02:06:03.56 --> 02:06:07.88
I did not know how I was going to be able to hold the telephone without dropping it a nervous

2007
02:06:07.88 --> 02:06:12.52
laugh escape my lips but no words came out as I listened to Bob continue speaking now Jose you

2008
02:06:12.52 --> 02:06:17.24
cannot tell anybody beyond your immediate family about this because it will be announced at a press

2009
02:06:17.24 --> 02:06:22.12
conference on May 6 at NASA headquarters in Washington DC warned the voice at the other

2010
02:06:22.12 --> 02:06:27.08
in the line I agreed said goodbye and hung up I did not tell anyone anything I still had four hours

2011
02:06:27.08 --> 02:06:30.68
before I could go home for work and I could not think of anything else but telling my beautiful

2012
02:06:30.68 --> 02:06:36.12
wife Adelaida she had to be the first to hear the good news followed by my kids and then my parents

2013
02:06:36.12 --> 02:06:41.08
the ten minute drive home seemed to last an eternity Adelaida Adelaida guess what our opportunity

2014
02:06:41.08 --> 02:06:48.44
has come finally I got accepted I'm going to be an astronaut there it is yeah

2015
02:06:48.44 --> 02:06:57.24
how many so how many total times did you apply it was the 12th time the 12th time 11 straight years

2016
02:06:57.24 --> 02:07:01.96
of rejection exactly and the 12th time there you are 12 times the charm

2017
02:07:05.40 --> 02:07:08.84
NASA press conference took place I still had to keep the big news a secret from all

2018
02:07:08.84 --> 02:07:13.40
to everyone at 11 a.m. my fellow astronauts and I were brought face to face with the press we

2019
02:07:13.40 --> 02:07:18.84
were all nervous and careful of our every step as we walk single file line just like my siblings

2020
02:07:18.84 --> 02:07:23.80
and I had when we entered that house after coming home from school when the cameras and microphones

2021
02:07:23.80 --> 02:07:28.12
were directed us I remember thinking to myself I'm an astronaut not a famous movie star my

2022
02:07:28.12 --> 02:07:32.44
palms were sweaty and there was nothing I could do about it we are introduced one by one

2023
02:07:32.44 --> 02:07:38.84
satcher cacity Arnold Dutton and Hernandez and cacities a seal he was in your group home yes

2024
02:07:38.84 --> 02:07:47.000
I'm a classmate good friend of mine that's awesome um our first big training assignment

2025
02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:52.04
involved traveling to the Naval Air Station in Pensacola Florida once there we spent six weeks

2026
02:07:52.04 --> 02:07:58.68
going to ground school being taught water survival techniques learning how to co-pilot the T-34

2027
02:07:58.68 --> 02:08:02.28
airplanes ground school involved not only learning basic principles of flight but also putting

2028
02:08:02.28 --> 02:08:07.48
those principles to work in high fidelity flight simulators probably the most interesting

2029
02:08:07.48 --> 02:08:12.04
activity during the six-week training program was the one where we went on submersible device

2030
02:08:12.04 --> 02:08:17.96
that simulated the fuselage of a helicopter this device is it actually known as the helodunker

2031
02:08:19.24 --> 02:08:25.08
so you when you get picked up when you get picked up for the program you're still not an astronaut

2032
02:08:25.08 --> 02:08:29.08
you have to make it through how long is that training program two years it's astronaut candidate program

2033
02:08:29.64 --> 02:08:37.24
it's two years you go through a lot of academics you go through the learning the

2034
02:08:37.24 --> 02:08:45.40
systems of the space shuttle 18 you know a typical airline has about eight or nine subsystems

2035
02:08:45.80 --> 02:08:53.96
an airline plane the space shuttle has 18 and you have to learn each one of them you have written

2036
02:08:53.96 --> 02:08:58.68
tests on each one of them then you got single system trainers so you master each one of them

2037
02:08:58.68 --> 02:09:04.04
then you got multi system trainers where they start cross-pollinating the systems and how one

2038
02:09:04.04 --> 02:09:09.64
system affects the other and then you've got the high fidelity motion base simulator

2039
02:09:09.64 --> 02:09:15.24
where then it pick up crew a four of you are in the cockpit and they draw everything about the kitchen

2040
02:09:15.24 --> 02:09:21.80
sink at you and you've got us you know it's either an asset run or is an orbit operations

2041
02:09:21.80 --> 02:09:26.20
or it's a landing and but they all fail things for you and you got to figure it out and you

2042
02:09:26.20 --> 02:09:33.40
got to pass all that every Friday there's a test it's like being in finals week for two continuous

2043
02:09:33.40 --> 02:09:38.28
years I mean pre-intense but I mean I'm sure it's similar to like for seal training as well

2044
02:09:38.28 --> 02:09:44.44
that that you have to go through all these things but it's not only you know it's academic mental

2045
02:09:44.44 --> 02:09:50.36
physical the whole combination of things where they really stress you and you know that's how they

2046
02:09:50.36 --> 02:09:56.04
figure out you've got the right stuff if you're able to survive that then then you move on you get your

2047
02:09:56.04 --> 02:10:02.84
wings and now you're eligible for a flight assignment how many people that get selected to enter the

2048
02:10:02.84 --> 02:10:08.92
pipeline the two-year pipeline how many people don't make it you know it's very rare that a

2049
02:10:08.92 --> 02:10:14.60
person doesn't make it because they've been filters oh filters they've been filtered you know the

2050
02:10:14.60 --> 02:10:21.000
book says 4,000 that was when it first began but when I was in and at my 12th try we were up to 12,000

2051
02:10:21.56 --> 02:10:27.48
this past selection run they were up to 18,000 applicants so they filter it pretty well

2052
02:10:27.48 --> 02:10:34.44
including the psychologists that filter everything that you know when they when they select you

2053
02:10:34.44 --> 02:10:40.28
you know that they have a high probability 99.9% that you're gonna make it because you've been

2054
02:10:40.28 --> 02:10:45.72
filtered you've been tested aptitude testing psychological testing stress testing so they have

2055
02:10:45.72 --> 02:10:51.000
been feeling that you're gonna make it so but you still gotta do it yeah no that's the impression

2056
02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:57.24
that I got when reading this also talking to Johnny Kim and is that if you get selected they

2057
02:10:57.24 --> 02:11:01.000
have already they've already figured out because the thing that's interesting to me is you

2058
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.84
talk about you put in these failure failure situations over and over again and you know there's

2059
02:11:06.84 --> 02:11:10.20
people that panic in those situations there's people that lose their cool in those situations

2060
02:11:10.20 --> 02:11:13.80
there's people that don't on a handle themselves that's why I think it's interesting like

2061
02:11:13.80 --> 02:11:19.40
just because you became a pilot well if you panic if you become a pilot you learn to get control

2062
02:11:19.40 --> 02:11:23.80
of your emotions and not panic and same thing with scuba dive right scuba if you panic or your

2063
02:11:23.80 --> 02:11:28.44
scuba diving or something goes wrong you're gonna have some real problems so those are things

2064
02:11:28.44 --> 02:11:32.28
that they're looking at your application go well he's a pilot so we know he's at least going to

2065
02:11:32.28 --> 02:11:36.12
be able to detach from his emotions though oh he's a scuba diver so when things get into his

2066
02:11:36.12 --> 02:11:40.04
not claustrophilic claustrophilic claustrophilic so there's they have all these things in line so

2067
02:11:40.04 --> 02:11:45.24
that you can you have a very high percentage chance obviously you could have some kind of a

2068
02:11:45.24 --> 02:11:52.04
medical anomaly or something but that is the I do I'm I'm curious I'm sure people will

2069
02:11:52.04 --> 02:11:57.64
give me feedback if there's a more highly screened job that astronaut and I know you just

2070
02:11:57.64 --> 02:12:03.08
gave some props to seal training I could tell you there's all kinds of knuckle draggers and

2071
02:12:03.08 --> 02:12:10.36
see well I'm probably case case and point you know exhibit a that that what we go through is more

2072
02:12:10.36 --> 02:12:18.84
about just being wet cold and miserable but so fast forward a little bit once our two years

2073
02:12:18.84 --> 02:12:23.48
of training and testing over where you held a small graduation ceremony at Space Center Houston

2074
02:12:23.48 --> 02:12:28.68
can't rumble the chief of the astronaut office said a few words before presenting each of us with

2075
02:12:28.68 --> 02:12:34.28
a silver pin with the astronaut logo on it this is a symbol used for astronauts who have yet to travel

2076
02:12:34.28 --> 02:12:39.48
in the space a gold pin symbolized that an astronaut has already flown on a mission so you get the

2077
02:12:39.48 --> 02:12:47.48
new guy symbol exactly but it's an important symbol because you're now eligible you're in the pool

2078
02:12:47.48 --> 02:12:54.68
of eligible astronauts when they select a new crew you could be one selected whereas before you

2079
02:12:54.68 --> 02:13:00.12
were just an ascan astronaut candidate you couldn't be selected to train for a real mission

2080
02:13:00.12 --> 02:13:07.000
now you you're eligible to get assigned and meanwhile you talk about that you have so once you

2081
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:13.40
once you become an astronaut and you're not an ascan anymore you're not used enough you're not

2082
02:13:13.40 --> 02:13:18.68
an ascan anywhere you're an actual astronaut then you spend 20% of your time sort of focused on

2083
02:13:18.68 --> 02:13:24.28
training and simulations and getting ready to fly a mission 80% of your time is work yes

2084
02:13:24.28 --> 02:13:30.12
and your job was a cape crusader exactly tell us about the cape crusader yeah we call them sea

2085
02:13:30.12 --> 02:13:36.76
squared's uh because that's a cap crusader to seize sea squared's um it was great I was a great

2086
02:13:36.76 --> 02:13:45.24
job you know two weeks before launch you and three other buddies as group of four astronauts

2087
02:13:45.24 --> 02:13:51.96
you fly over from Houston to Florida where the birds at the shuttle and you start prepping the vehicle

2088
02:13:51.96 --> 02:13:58.36
for launch so you start prepping the inside and doing testing with ground control and everything so

2089
02:13:58.36 --> 02:14:07.80
you get everything ready for the mission and then uh and then uh the day of the launch then uh

2090
02:14:07.80 --> 02:14:13.88
if you're the lead uh sea squared then you get the number seven on you know how you see all those

2091
02:14:13.88 --> 02:14:19.48
white-tick-nissians the number seven's always the astronaut there's a was there's always an astronaut

2092
02:14:19.48 --> 02:14:26.92
there because he's the one that buckles the there are fellow astronauts into the cockpit of every

2093
02:14:26.92 --> 02:14:32.76
mission and unfortunately your face is the last one they see before they go up into space yeah and so

2094
02:14:32.76 --> 02:14:41.08
so uh and I did that a couple times um you know I four four like uh four like two years I participated

2095
02:14:41.08 --> 02:14:47.72
as a sea squared but during the last part of those two years I got I was the lead uh sea squared

2096
02:14:47.72 --> 02:14:53.64
because that's not usually happens is the lead guy first year the new guy and then uh you're the

2097
02:14:53.64 --> 02:14:59.40
middle guy and then uh you're the expert and then you get a sign so you move out and then so the

2098
02:14:59.40 --> 02:15:03.88
middle guy becomes the expert and so that's kind of like a fifle first in first out kind of thing uh

2099
02:15:03.88 --> 02:15:08.60
you become an expert by the level of your experience but then you get a sign to a mission and so

2100
02:15:08.60 --> 02:15:13.56
that's what happened to me I participated about seven launches during those two years and the last

2101
02:15:13.56 --> 02:15:20.04
two I was the lead sea squared and uh it's great because you go there two weeks before your uh you're

2102
02:15:20.04 --> 02:15:25.56
in crew quarters uh so you you spend time with the astronauts you know they arrive about a week before

2103
02:15:25.56 --> 02:15:30.12
the launch so you spend time with them uh before they're gonna go off to their mission you're

2104
02:15:30.12 --> 02:15:35.56
uh your debriefing them on the status of the bird and how things are going and all that kind of

2105
02:15:35.56 --> 02:15:39.88
thing any questions they have and then uh the day of the launch you know you go out there with them

2106
02:15:39.88 --> 02:15:45.32
and uh you're out there strapping them in and getting them ready and then it's pretty neat because

2107
02:15:45.32 --> 02:15:53.000
you're also part of the rescue crew so you're in the closest the absolute closest part you can be

2108
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.12
to watch the launch I mean you can feel the wear wear you can physically wear or you can feel

2109
02:15:58.12 --> 02:16:02.84
uh one of the bunkers you can feel the heat you can feel the heat of the exhaust you know because

2110
02:16:02.84 --> 02:16:08.68
it's so close I mean it's dangerously close you're sitting there in a bunker with uh with a bullet

2111
02:16:08.68 --> 02:16:14.04
proof glass or something like that you can watch how far away you think you are from it and

2112
02:16:14.04 --> 02:16:19.000
see I would say about a mile mile and a half maybe and you can still feel the heat or yes you can

2113
02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:24.92
feel you can feel the heat and uh but it's just amazing I mean that launch that you go out I mean it's

2114
02:16:24.92 --> 02:16:31.000
it's it's it's it's it's it's crazy when you see it take off you can't believe that big

2115
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.44
heavy piece of metal is gonna take off and you know there it goes I was going through navy boot camp

2116
02:16:36.44 --> 02:16:42.68
so this is September sometime I think was either September and October of 1990 and I'm in Orlando

2117
02:16:42.68 --> 02:16:47.80
Florida going to boot camp and I'm standing at parade rest out on the out on the grinder and

2118
02:16:47.80 --> 02:16:51.72
there was a space shuttle launch and we said you know sat there and watch this thing go up into space

2119
02:16:51.72 --> 02:16:59.08
yeah yeah it's a quite an image is it even from that this is very cool um meanwhile

2120
02:17:00.84 --> 02:17:05.40
going back to the look my wife Adelita had just opened up a restaurant in Houston

2121
02:17:06.20 --> 02:17:10.84
down the street from the Johnson Space Center on the corner of Saturn and Gemini in the

2122
02:17:10.84 --> 02:17:16.36
clear lake area so she's just getting after it going and opening up in a restaurant she always

2123
02:17:16.36 --> 02:17:21.16
had a dream of opening up a restaurant you know she grew up in the same social economic conditions

2124
02:17:21.16 --> 02:17:26.04
I did their parents are from Mexico and she was born over there because she was born in November

2125
02:17:26.04 --> 02:17:30.44
okay there was the Christmas I was she would have been born here but she was born over there and

2126
02:17:30.44 --> 02:17:39.000
so she came up with the same upbringing I did and um and so her dream was always to uh own and

2127
02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:46.44
operate a restaurant and so once I got situated I got selected I was jogging one day and I found this

2128
02:17:46.44 --> 02:17:51.64
place that was for rent and I took her I was about here it's only a couple blocks from the restaurant

2129
02:17:51.64 --> 02:17:58.68
so we opened it it's called it was called a Tierra Luna Grill and Tierra Luna means

2130
02:17:58.68 --> 02:18:06.04
earth moon but my buddies astronaut buddies didn't call it earth moon because Tierra is also dirt

2131
02:18:06.04 --> 02:18:11.48
so they called earth moon grill so this goes dirt moon grill the eat and so that that will be

2132
02:18:11.48 --> 02:18:17.32
the hangout for the astronauts to eat but I remember the very first time I um I went out there

2133
02:18:17.32 --> 02:18:25.40
as a sea squared I literally just opened up the restaurant and so imagine this you know we get up

2134
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:33.40
at three in the morning and so I go and prep the vehicle and then I go and and the astronauts

2135
02:18:33.40 --> 02:18:41.32
arrive about six o'clock so so we we then tuck him in and into into into the space shuttle you know

2136
02:18:41.32 --> 02:18:46.28
close the hatch so care of him do our leak checks everything works out we go out to the muster

2137
02:18:46.28 --> 02:18:53.16
area for the rescue area and um and we see him blast off and that was my first that was the first

2138
02:18:53.16 --> 02:18:59.72
shuttle I seen in person large and I was that close and so it takes off it takes off and

2139
02:18:59.72 --> 02:19:06.44
this is about nine thirty now so as soon as it takes off there's nothing for us to do so what do we

2140
02:19:06.44 --> 02:19:15.24
do we hop on the on the T thirty eight jet that's right there that we had flew flown in from

2141
02:19:15.24 --> 02:19:23.48
Mah Houston and we go back to Houston, Elintinfield and Elintinfield about six miles from Johnson Space Center

2142
02:19:23.48 --> 02:19:28.44
so instead of midday I say well I'm not gonna go home now so I could go back to the office so

2143
02:19:28.44 --> 02:19:32.84
I'm driving to the office but on the way is the latest restaurant so I want to go get some

2144
02:19:32.84 --> 02:19:38.04
lunch get some dirt move yeah guys go go dirt move we're gonna get some lunch and plus I want to tell

2145
02:19:38.04 --> 02:19:45.16
the Lita the whole exciting what I saw okay that was the first one that was the first one yeah so

2146
02:19:45.16 --> 02:19:50.52
I'm over there so excited and you know because I flew on the T thirty eight over the golf over

2147
02:19:50.52 --> 02:19:56.92
the pond landed so there I am telling the Lita you know how I you know flew the T thirty

2148
02:19:56.92 --> 02:20:02.36
eight jet we're back on how I saw these space shuttle you know to think that the space shuttle

2149
02:20:02.36 --> 02:20:07.96
I was on the space shuttle at three four five in the morning and now it's up in space and my buddies

2150
02:20:07.96 --> 02:20:13.24
are up in space and she's kind of like what looking at her watch and it's so she wasn't even paying

2151
02:20:13.24 --> 02:20:21.000
attention to that and I say exactly it's kind of like the teacher from Charlie Brown right and so I

2152
02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.84
kind of I say what's wrong it's all nothing so well you know maybe you can help me

2153
02:20:26.84 --> 02:20:31.24
I said you know what can I do I said do you have about an hour and a half as parents said yeah

2154
02:20:31.24 --> 02:20:35.80
I probably can I'm not no one's expecting you back in the office and yeah I got an hour and a half

2155
02:20:35.80 --> 02:20:42.44
spare so my dishwasher didn't show up today so would you mind you know this is the busy time

2156
02:20:42.44 --> 02:20:48.44
the busy times coming is close to lunch would you mind washing the dishes for me for just

2157
02:20:48.44 --> 02:20:55.48
in part an hour and just to the rush those over and I'm still in my blue flight soon yeah so

2158
02:20:55.48 --> 02:21:01.88
I put on an apron and I you know throw up my sleeves and there I am you know spraying beans and

2159
02:21:01.88 --> 02:21:08.12
rise off the plates and it's because it's a Mexican restaurant you know all this stuff and she walks in

2160
02:21:08.12 --> 02:21:14.28
and and I said you know I tell her I can't believe it it's a three in the morning I was in the most

2161
02:21:14.28 --> 02:21:24.20
sophisticated piece of machinery that humans could ever had made and then I was flying a T38

2162
02:21:24.20 --> 02:21:30.52
jet across the pond the couple Mexico landed it here and what am I doing right now

2163
02:21:30.52 --> 02:21:38.92
I'm washing ficken beans off of the plate and she just looked at me said but you're doing a

2164
02:21:38.92 --> 02:21:46.68
damn good job. Most over coffee dishwasher of all time probably the only but probably the only

2165
02:21:46.68 --> 02:21:53.000
dishwasher ever to take a T38 jet to work. Exactly and so so that's you know in Humboldt's.

2166
02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:58.44
Got a humble the family Humboldt's you the family yeah and I'll tell you the other story that you

2167
02:21:58.44 --> 02:22:04.84
you I didn't tell you also that has to do with the blue suit too is um which

2168
02:22:04.84 --> 02:22:10.28
was it my my fourth daughter my fourth daughter I mean the fourth in line third daughter the

2169
02:22:10.28 --> 02:22:16.52
youngest daughter of them all I remember when I got selected as a master. What they give you that blue

2170
02:22:16.52 --> 02:22:22.76
flight suit right and because it has your velcroed name tag here and everything the NASA meat ball

2171
02:22:22.76 --> 02:22:28.52
low low and all American flag you know that kind of stuff looks pretty cool so they give it to you

2172
02:22:28.52 --> 02:22:32.52
so I bring it home you know the first day they gave it to me so you know I want to try it on

2173
02:22:32.52 --> 02:22:37.16
make sure it's the right size they gave me and all that so I put it on but wife has it for

2174
02:22:38.04 --> 02:22:44.60
dress mirror in bedroom right so there I am I'm putting it on you know it has zippers galore everywhere

2175
02:22:44.60 --> 02:22:48.84
right zippers here is in this here is it for series ifers here zippers on the legs and zippers

2176
02:22:48.84 --> 02:22:53.08
down the pant legs and all that stuff so I'm playing with them getting to know and then you know

2177
02:22:53.08 --> 02:22:59.000
posing kind of doing my best you know hero shots kind of thing you know well I won't be true for

2178
02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:05.08
this kind of you know flexing kind of you know that kind of stuff and then my my five year old daughter

2179
02:23:05.72 --> 02:23:12.44
walks into the bedroom the doors open and and and and and she's kind of like yeah look she was young

2180
02:23:12.44 --> 02:23:17.80
and she was four years old because I remember she she's still had her little you know kind of the

2181
02:23:17.80 --> 02:23:26.60
and the Maggie pass her yeah and and she's looking at me like this and tilting her head one way tilting

2182
02:23:26.60 --> 02:23:32.28
her head the other way and I said oh she's gonna see me in my blue flight so she heard you know

2183
02:23:32.28 --> 02:23:36.44
because we've been talking that I became an astronaut and it's not she's gonna go and she's gonna hug

2184
02:23:36.44 --> 02:23:42.28
me and say hey puppy I'm so happy you're an astronaut and all that that's what the reaction I think

2185
02:23:42.28 --> 02:23:47.48
she's gonna happen once she sees me I didn't get embarrassed that she saw me posing because yeah she's

2186
02:23:47.48 --> 02:23:52.68
little if it was my wife I would have been a little bit but she was a little kid so you know I said hey

2187
02:23:52.68 --> 02:23:59.64
me how you doing and she's still turning her head and then in between the pacifier and

2188
02:23:59.64 --> 02:24:09.48
everything you know she points at me and she says you look like papa smart so from then on it

2189
02:24:09.48 --> 02:24:15.56
became whenever I want to look for my suit I say where's the smurf suit because when it's in the

2190
02:24:15.56 --> 02:24:20.28
laundry your son was it where's my smurf suit I need my smurf suit and so I gotta stay humble the

2191
02:24:20.28 --> 02:24:23.08
family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family.

2192
02:24:25.08 --> 02:24:29.64
Going forward a little bit you say everything seemed to be going according to how I ideally imagined it

2193
02:24:29.64 --> 02:24:35.16
would when I was a kid working in the ruts and groves the fields though my life seemed in order

2194
02:24:35.16 --> 02:24:40.12
there was a certain sense of emptiness there was no reason for me to feel this way since I had everything

2195
02:24:40.12 --> 02:24:45.24
I'd ever wished for out of nowhere I heard my mother's voice saying what is the purpose of having

2196
02:24:45.24 --> 02:24:50.36
goals in life working hard for them and achieving them if you cannot share them with others.

2197
02:24:51.40 --> 02:24:54.76
Even though I was sharing this moment with my family and friends I was still not completely

2198
02:24:54.76 --> 02:25:01.08
enjoying the moment or myself this was particularly true after coming to stock to speak at a school.

2199
02:25:01.64 --> 02:25:06.20
I felt the excitement my visit generated when I shared my experiences with the elementary school

2200
02:25:06.20 --> 02:25:11.56
children but then when I returned to Houston for training it felt as if I had never visited stockton

2201
02:25:11.56 --> 02:25:19.40
something was missing something that could give continuity to my visits during this time

2202
02:25:19.40 --> 02:25:24.28
my friends and colleagues had called or emailed me to tell me what a positive impact my

2203
02:25:24.28 --> 02:25:30.28
selection as an astronaut had made in the stockton community that was when the idea hit me why not

2204
02:25:30.28 --> 02:25:36.76
start a foundation that capitalizes on my role as an astronaut and allows me to inspire kids to do well

2205
02:25:36.76 --> 02:25:47.16
in school. So therefore angel pecon my saying that right and patty tow var two of my great friends

2206
02:25:47.16 --> 02:25:51.80
friends helped me start the legal framework work for establishing a nonprofit organization called the

2207
02:25:51.80 --> 02:25:57.24
Jose Hernandez reaching for the stars foundation angel and patty put together a board and helped me

2208
02:25:57.24 --> 02:26:03.40
define the foundation's mission which is to inspire kids to dream the impossible and to emphasize that

2209
02:26:03.40 --> 02:26:10.44
through education anything is possible and you say I do not believe in just pointing out a problem

2210
02:26:10.44 --> 02:26:15.24
and expecting the government to solve it on its own. I would like to think that this is the

2211
02:26:15.24 --> 02:26:20.04
responsibility of every person in the United States and that the private sector and foundations

2212
02:26:20.04 --> 02:26:25.96
such as mine should take some ownership for resolving this issue and that issue is getting more

2213
02:26:25.96 --> 02:26:34.04
kids into specifically stamps them science technology engineering and math fields yes so you got that

2214
02:26:34.04 --> 02:26:41.48
foundation started we'll talk a little bit about that at the end. You asked to see me sir I said

2215
02:26:41.48 --> 02:26:46.84
as soon as I walked into Mr. Steve Lindsay's office Mr. Lindsay was an active astronaut and the

2216
02:26:46.84 --> 02:26:52.44
chief of the astronaut office he was a very intelligent and slender all-American Air Force man

2217
02:26:52.44 --> 02:27:00.36
whose great-haired head stored a half centuries expert experience and knowledge yes Jose please

2218
02:27:00.36 --> 02:27:06.92
have a seat he told me politely I've called to inform you that you have been selected to form part of the

2219
02:27:06.92 --> 02:27:15.88
crew of the upcoming STS-128 mission in about 15 months you will be at the International Space Station

2220
02:27:15.88 --> 02:27:19.96
we will announce the names of the rest of the crew members at our all-hands meeting

2221
02:27:19.96 --> 02:27:26.44
this was something that I had long for and wished for my entire life it was the preamble

2222
02:27:26.44 --> 02:27:33.56
to my dream come true my dream had been actualized I found myself one step closer a significant

2223
02:27:33.56 --> 02:27:45.80
step closer to flying into space I thought finally my time has come the big day yes you got told

2224
02:27:45.80 --> 02:27:53.96
it was a go fast forward a little bit here we go as the launch data approached it became harder to sleep

2225
02:27:53.96 --> 02:27:58.20
I tossed and turned for hours until I was finally able to sleep soundly part of the reason I was

2226
02:27:58.20 --> 02:28:02.60
not a little sleep was because I kept thinking about what could possibly go wrong during the mission

2227
02:28:02.60 --> 02:28:07.64
what if something fails what will happen to my family how will my wife kids in parent handle it

2228
02:28:07.64 --> 02:28:11.96
those thoughts disrupted my tranquility luckily though as the data approach there was no time

2229
02:28:11.96 --> 02:28:17.40
left to worry about anything but the mission our crew began adapting to a new schedule going to

2230
02:28:17.40 --> 02:28:22.04
bed at 8 a.m. and waking up at 4 p.m. we were forced to shift our sleep cycle because those

2231
02:28:22.04 --> 02:28:28.20
were the hours we would be working on the International Space Station the close we got to launch

2232
02:28:28.20 --> 02:28:32.68
date the more lucid our mission objectives became our first objective was to transport a new crew

2233
02:28:32.68 --> 02:28:39.48
member Nicole stopped to the ISS and then return home with another astronaut Tim Copera

2234
02:28:39.48 --> 02:28:45.24
who had already spent more than two months in space second we had to conduct three space walks to

2235
02:28:45.24 --> 02:28:49.56
replace one of the stations ammonia filled tanks last we had to make an attempt taken a

2236
02:28:49.56 --> 02:28:54.52
Italian built portable laboratory called the multi purpose logistics module affectionate

2237
02:28:54.52 --> 02:29:00.44
called Leonardo we also need to bring back to earth about a ton of equipment and waste no longer

2238
02:29:00.44 --> 02:29:06.60
needed aboard the ISS with all that said we had only 13 days to complete our three mission

2239
02:29:06.60 --> 02:29:12.12
objectives so you got a schedule had an up there a heavy schedule there they're not playing around

2240
02:29:12.12 --> 02:29:18.52
they're going to get their money where fatten you exactly um um fast forward a little bit and I'm

2241
02:29:18.52 --> 02:29:22.92
going again look you got to get the book if you want to get the details of what's going on and it's

2242
02:29:23.64 --> 02:29:28.84
it's really fascinating to hear you know what you're thinking about as this progresses and

2243
02:29:29.48 --> 02:29:33.80
all the things that you're working to go on the things that you do as a team look I'm skipping

2244
02:29:33.80 --> 02:29:39.80
over a bunch of stuff the what you do is a team to kind of come together as a team the seven

2245
02:29:39.80 --> 02:29:45.08
person group that you're going to be working together is all this really incredible stuff again

2246
02:29:45.08 --> 02:29:49.80
I'm not doing an audio book here by the book you want to know what happens yeah there's a lot

2247
02:29:49.80 --> 02:29:57.16
lot your skip to oh yeah of course um so I am skipping to this part here we arrived at the launch pad

2248
02:29:57.80 --> 02:30:01.88
and entered the elevator to go up the hundred ninety two foot level where we had access to the

2249
02:30:01.88 --> 02:30:07.08
shuttles hatch a walkway allowed us to approach the white room that was next to the hatch it was in

2250
02:30:07.08 --> 02:30:12.04
this white room where we put on the last of our gear before entering the shuttle and getting

2251
02:30:12.04 --> 02:30:17.72
strapped in by the close-out crew one by one we were called in to take our seats

2252
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:25.16
fast forward members of the close-out crew exited the shuttle the hatch was shut and closed it was

2253
02:30:25.16 --> 02:30:30.36
then that the close-out crew performed a cabin leak check and then disassembled the white room

2254
02:30:30.36 --> 02:30:37.000
to clear the launch pad during the last hour before launch I sat strapped to my seat on the flight

2255
02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:45.32
deck a million different thoughts rushed through my mind fast forward a little bit suddenly I

2256
02:30:45.32 --> 02:30:50.84
heard the countdown reach the nine minute hold that is when the final systems checked are

2257
02:30:50.84 --> 02:30:55.80
conducted by the launch control center it was almost time make your final adjustments and prepare

2258
02:30:55.80 --> 02:31:02.92
for takeoff we heard cabin revision complete manuals ready seconds before launch the bottom of

2259
02:31:02.92 --> 02:31:07.96
the launch pad was sprayed with water and it effort to cushion the noise and vibration as a result

2260
02:31:07.96 --> 02:31:14.28
of the power dissipated by both the three main the three shuttle main engines and the two solid rocket

2261
02:31:14.28 --> 02:31:23.16
boosters everything was going to plan until P. Nicolenko for launch director informed us that

2262
02:31:23.16 --> 02:31:29.96
the weather conditions were unfavorable 50 minutes later our mission was aboard a due to local

2263
02:31:29.96 --> 02:31:38.92
funder storms in the Florida skies so close so close out a few hours later a new date and time was

2264
02:31:38.92 --> 02:31:46.28
announced for the discovery launch Wednesday August 26th 2009 this was a 48 hour slip the mission

2265
02:31:46.28 --> 02:31:51.08
management team who had set the new launch date obviously did not share or optimism about the weather

2266
02:31:51.08 --> 02:31:57.16
improving within 24 hours as we woke up on Wednesday we found out that it was not going to happen

2267
02:31:57.16 --> 02:32:03.56
then either we discovered a defective fuel control valve which is being replaced at the moment

2268
02:32:03.56 --> 02:32:11.80
we pushed back the launch date again for 1159 on Friday August 28th 2009 NASA informed us

2269
02:32:13.64 --> 02:32:18.04
that reminds me of you know when you're on an airplane at the on the tarmac and first it

2270
02:32:18.04 --> 02:32:22.04
gets delayed and then it gets delayed again and all of a sudden they go hey we found a maintenance

2271
02:32:22.04 --> 02:32:26.68
problem next thing you know if like it's canceled we're deborting yeah and I was a legitimate

2272
02:32:26.68 --> 02:32:31.32
there was a chance that you wouldn't if this got rolled a little bit more there would be no launch at

2273
02:32:31.32 --> 02:32:38.28
all that's right so this the whole thing isn't jeopardy yeah but was that faulty fuel valve

2274
02:32:38.28 --> 02:32:44.12
would that have been a problem that's that that's you know the thing that we don't know you know

2275
02:32:44.12 --> 02:32:50.68
we're kind of lucky the weather was bad yeah because you don't know if that faulty fuel valve

2276
02:32:50.68 --> 02:32:56.92
would have acted up during that launch right and and once we shut things off and then started

2277
02:32:56.92 --> 02:33:03.000
back up we got that indication and we replaced it so you know it could have been that the weather

2278
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:12.04
saved us could have been just let me know luckily on Friday we once again found ourselves

2279
02:33:12.04 --> 02:33:16.04
sitting inside discovery ready for takeoff with only two and a half hours to go I knew it was

2280
02:33:16.04 --> 02:33:21.88
only a matter time before a button was pushed and we would be well on our way into space the

2281
02:33:21.88 --> 02:33:27.08
NASA team in Houston was confident that the third time wasn't needed charm suddenly in the blink

2282
02:33:27.08 --> 02:33:31.72
of an eye the countdown clock was set in a motion after having reached the nine minute hold

2283
02:33:32.44 --> 02:33:40.20
we could hear the countdown nine minutes five seconds four three two we closed our helmet

2284
02:33:40.20 --> 02:33:45.08
advisers as we heard the three main engines light up shortly thereafter we felt the gentle

2285
02:33:45.08 --> 02:33:49.72
vibrations of the engines about two seconds later as the countdown reached zero the noise level

2286
02:33:49.72 --> 02:33:55.08
increased in a magnitude and the vibrations grew more violent the two solid motors attached to the

2287
02:33:55.08 --> 02:33:59.88
side of the external tanks it had ignited just as I thought the whole shuttle was going to shake

2288
02:33:59.88 --> 02:34:06.60
apart or fall to one side I felt a lot of pressure on my back I heard zero takeoff

2289
02:34:06.60 --> 02:34:12.44
through the corner my eye could see the tower staying behind as we lifted off we were on our way

2290
02:34:12.44 --> 02:34:17.80
immediately the muscle memory of our training simulations took over I quickly focused on my job as

2291
02:34:17.80 --> 02:34:22.44
mission specialist too which was to execute the role of a flight engineer I began reading off the

2292
02:34:22.44 --> 02:34:27.64
pre-determined milestones to our commander in pilot while monitoring the screens engages in the front

2293
02:34:27.64 --> 02:34:32.12
and above me doing sure none of them would deviate from their expected readings the most dynamic

2294
02:34:32.12 --> 02:34:36.84
parts of our mission were blast off in the subsequent eight and a half minute flight into space

2295
02:34:36.84 --> 02:34:42.84
during the latter we went from resting on the launch pad to orbiting our planet at more than 17,000

2296
02:34:42.84 --> 02:34:50.04
500 miles an hour at an altitude of some 280 miles two and a half minutes into our launch the two

2297
02:34:50.04 --> 02:34:55.24
solid rocket boosters separated and fell to the ocean about 200 miles northeast of the Kennedy

2298
02:34:55.24 --> 02:35:00.84
space center after the initial two and a half minutes the next six minutes became quieter and the

2299
02:35:00.84 --> 02:35:05.56
ride became a lot smoother when we reached eight minutes and 30 seconds into the flight we had

2300
02:35:05.56 --> 02:35:11.32
reached the main engine cut off this basically meant that we had reached our top speed of 11,000 or

2301
02:35:11.32 --> 02:35:17.64
17,500 miles an hour and it turned off our main engines the next step was for us to monitor the

2302
02:35:17.64 --> 02:35:24.60
separation of the external tank which was feeding our three main engines the external tank typically

2303
02:35:24.60 --> 02:35:29.48
ends up so high that it does not survive reentry into the atmosphere and thus disintegrates into

2304
02:35:29.48 --> 02:35:35.24
pieces before falling armlessly back into the ocean the shuttle usually possesses enough energy

2305
02:35:35.24 --> 02:35:41.08
to continue upward and when appropriate begins orbiting the planet soon after this happened to us

2306
02:35:41.08 --> 02:35:47.88
we approached we reached a microgravity environment and began floating in space high above the earth

2307
02:35:47.88 --> 02:35:57.16
our mission was well on its way we did that thing starts to rumble well how's that feel

2308
02:35:57.16 --> 02:36:04.52
that the exhaust that go you know I'll be honest with you jacos is that you know if there was

2309
02:36:04.52 --> 02:36:11.96
any piece of fear during this whole process of being an astronaut I would have to say it's

2310
02:36:11.96 --> 02:36:21.000
probably the first three seconds of when you reach zero and you feel the three engines light up and then

2311
02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:29.72
you feel the two solid rocket motors turn on come to life all of a sudden things are vibrating and

2312
02:36:29.72 --> 02:36:35.000
you know this is the type of stuff that can't be simulated here on earth and so you don't know

2313
02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:41.56
what to expect and yeah that moment you you you know the first thing I said is Jose what did you get

2314
02:36:41.56 --> 02:36:47.96
yourself you know but then shortly after that as the book indicates you know muscle memory takes

2315
02:36:47.96 --> 02:36:56.76
over and you know we've done a bunch of simulated motion-based asset runs as a crew and so I focus

2316
02:36:56.76 --> 02:37:03.32
on to my tassack and him you know I had the best seed in the house because I'm sitting a little

2317
02:37:03.32 --> 02:37:10.92
af of the two pilots the commander in the pilot Kevin Ford and my commander CJ Sturkow

2318
02:37:10.92 --> 02:37:17.64
great marine pilot and and and Kevin Ford is an air force pilot and I'm sitting a little

2319
02:37:17.64 --> 02:37:23.88
behind them in the middle so I get the panoramic view but you know of course I have to

2320
02:37:23.88 --> 02:37:31.40
hawk all the 10 screens of both pilots so that anything goes off nominal I peel off with the

2321
02:37:31.40 --> 02:37:36.60
person that owns the system and me as a flight engineer you know I'm the one that's basically

2322
02:37:36.60 --> 02:37:43.08
quarterbacking what the problem is diagnosing what we need to be doing and between the pilot

2323
02:37:43.08 --> 02:37:50.20
and I we solve or try to minimize its effect while the other pilot flies the nominal portion

2324
02:37:50.20 --> 02:37:56.68
of the mission and so so but nothing happened it was the best similar I always tell my commander

2325
02:37:56.68 --> 02:38:02.36
this was the best simulation run ever because nothing happened everything occurred as it was supposed

2326
02:38:02.36 --> 02:38:09.48
to occur unlike our simulations where they throw the kitchen sink out and so but man you know

2327
02:38:09.48 --> 02:38:15.88
words can't describe those eight and a half minutes apart flight because you know you start off

2328
02:38:15.88 --> 02:38:22.92
like the greatest Disneyland ride ever and and then as you as you move up the two and a half minutes

2329
02:38:22.92 --> 02:38:30.84
when the solid rocket boosters pop off it becomes smooth smooth the ride more quiet ride

2330
02:38:30.84 --> 02:38:37.48
but you start accelerating more and you start feeling the pressure against your chest so you end up

2331
02:38:37.48 --> 02:38:46.28
feeling about up to it goes almost up to three G's a force right on your chest and that's three G's is

2332
02:38:46.28 --> 02:38:53.48
about what is it three people that way exactly like you on top of you that's how three G's feel so

2333
02:38:53.48 --> 02:38:59.24
I at at the mark of eight and a half minutes you're ready for this to be over you're ready for

2334
02:38:59.24 --> 02:39:05.32
main engine cut off meco and and because when that happens you stop accelerating so that 500

2335
02:39:05.32 --> 02:39:10.60
pound gorilla disappears and now you're kind of loosey goosey in your seat but you got your seat belt

2336
02:39:10.60 --> 02:39:17.56
on but now you're in a microgravity environment orbiting earth once every 90 minutes on a continuous

2337
02:39:17.56 --> 02:39:25.32
base 17,000 miles an hour is 17,500 miles an hour you're traveling but because now you're not

2338
02:39:25.32 --> 02:39:30.04
accelerating you don't feel the G forces so now you're it's kind of like being on a plane

2339
02:39:30.04 --> 02:39:37.000
500 miles an hour you don't feel that you only feel the take off kind of thing and so yeah so

2340
02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.20
you know it's it's crazy because you know when you look out the window and you see the U.S. you

2341
02:39:42.20 --> 02:39:47.40
go off and do something for 20 minutes and now you're flying over China or Australia or over Europe

2342
02:39:47.40 --> 02:39:53.24
kind of thing it's it's it's it's the craziest feeling I ever had this I said wow this is

2343
02:39:53.24 --> 02:40:00.36
uh this is a good way to travel yeah and it's uh as you're describing that both in writing and then

2344
02:40:00.36 --> 02:40:07.24
you're talking you're sitting on a freaking bomb on a bomb that's what you're sitting on all that stuff

2345
02:40:07.24 --> 02:40:14.44
just wants to explode and it's just control yeah it's a controlled detonation yeah that's when you're

2346
02:40:14.44 --> 02:40:23.32
on the top of that you're on the top of that puppy um once you get into space you go into this

2347
02:40:23.32 --> 02:40:29.88
this schedule of all this stuff that you that you've got to do and you you you you detail in the book

2348
02:40:29.88 --> 02:40:34.44
it's it's a great read one thing you you have a little case of nausea while you're up there

2349
02:40:34.44 --> 02:40:41.32
a little like c sickness yeah it's they caught s a s space adaptation sickness so it makes you feel a

2350
02:40:41.32 --> 02:40:48.28
little nauseated you know one of my crew members lost their cookies you know I didn't I actually

2351
02:40:48.28 --> 02:40:55.48
lost them on the way back which is uh one gee a re-adaptation uh but but but uh under way up one of

2352
02:40:55.48 --> 02:41:01.64
my crew mates did get get sick to the point they you know they had to throw up but uh but it goes away

2353
02:41:01.64 --> 02:41:07.000
you know after a day or so that feeling it's kind of like being in the back of a bus and going

2354
02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.64
up a mountain curves and all that you kind of feel a little car sick nauseated but then it goes

2355
02:41:11.64 --> 02:41:18.04
but then it goes away yeah um fast forward a little bit day three we're about 183 meters away from

2356
02:41:18.04 --> 02:41:22.52
the international space station our shuttle began the 360 degree rotation for the purpose of being

2357
02:41:22.52 --> 02:41:29.08
photographed using high resolution photography and video by the space station crew they take pictures

2358
02:41:29.08 --> 02:41:34.36
from the space station of the space shuttle just to make sure there's no damage on lift off

2359
02:41:34.36 --> 02:41:40.52
but that's got to be pretty weird to be up in space and you're 183 yards away from this other big

2360
02:41:40.52 --> 02:41:46.36
chunk of metal traveling at 17,000 miles a thousand five miles yeah yeah but but that was one of

2361
02:41:46.36 --> 02:41:54.12
the new um procedures as a result of the Columbia accident that we put is that uh we would you know

2362
02:41:54.12 --> 02:42:01.24
before we talked to the station we would reach a certain distance stop do a holding pattern there

2363
02:42:01.24 --> 02:42:06.92
and then we would do a maneuver where we would show our belly to them and as we're showing our

2364
02:42:06.92 --> 02:42:12.44
belly they're filming everything of course uh down linking it to the uh engineers down on a ground

2365
02:42:13.32 --> 02:42:19.24
looking at that leading uh wing edge and any other type of things that other damage I could have

2366
02:42:19.24 --> 02:42:24.76
occurred to your TPS system which is your thermal protection system which is the underbelly

2367
02:42:24.76 --> 02:42:32.12
and the wing leading edge of the of the shuttle that that we uh we investigate inspect uh

2368
02:42:33.80 --> 02:42:40.44
the docking you call it a collision in here so it says a collision or soft dock that's got to be crazy

2369
02:42:40.44 --> 02:42:45.000
too you're aiming the space shuttle at that thing and you're gonna have like a connect yeah you're

2370
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:51.96
gonna connect and I'll tell you um it was even kind of crazy a little bit more crazy for us than normal

2371
02:42:51.96 --> 02:42:58.52
because um you know nothing real big happened in terms of malfunctions during our mission except this

2372
02:42:58.52 --> 02:43:06.84
one thing and um the shuttle has um built in jets to maneuver in space including the ohms

2373
02:43:06.84 --> 02:43:11.64
engine orbital maneuvering system those are the big engines that we fire the slow down so that we

2374
02:43:11.64 --> 02:43:17.16
can get back into the atmosphere but we don't use those for docking we have built in jets that are

2375
02:43:17.16 --> 02:43:25.32
on the nose the tail and near the wings of the uh of the shuttle and they fire to maneuver

2376
02:43:25.32 --> 02:43:33.56
in space and um and we have two types we have the regular call RCS jets reaction control system jets

2377
02:43:33.56 --> 02:43:39.16
and then we've got the verneers which are the fine tuning jets they're kind of like the small ones

2378
02:43:39.16 --> 02:43:46.20
they're one tenth the thrust the big ones and so when as you as you're docking to the station

2379
02:43:46.20 --> 02:43:55.32
you use the rough ones the RCS and then as you get in you switch to the fine ones so you could

2380
02:43:55.32 --> 02:44:01.80
do the fine tuning so that you can dock because the the pilot the both pilots have are at the

2381
02:44:01.80 --> 02:44:08.36
controls I'm at the station as flight engineer giving them uh and they're using um they have a

2382
02:44:08.36 --> 02:44:13.56
target so they have a um they camera systems so they're looking at that the camera one's looking

2383
02:44:13.56 --> 02:44:23.000
outside and then I'm looking at the screens giving them speed uh I give in them uh distance uh and

2384
02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.96
and then also whether they're in plane or out of plane in terms of I give them numbers to

2385
02:44:27.96 --> 02:44:32.92
indicate that if if it's all zeros it means they're coming in plane and then if it's a different number

2386
02:44:32.92 --> 02:44:38.76
I give them so that they can provide some type of correction and they're doing all that but as I

2387
02:44:38.76 --> 02:44:44.92
mentioned as you get closer you switch over to the fine jets which move you very little but our fine

2388
02:44:44.92 --> 02:44:54.84
jets fail so there's no vernier jets so we got the big honking rough you know course jets that we can

2389
02:44:54.84 --> 02:45:03.72
do so now our our our our commander CJ Sturk out of the good marini is um you know when you when you

2390
02:45:03.72 --> 02:45:11.24
move a a vernier jet you know you move very little but when you move when you do the regular RCS

2391
02:45:11.24 --> 02:45:21.72
jets it goes like that right and so what he has to do is he's looking at the at the approaching speed

2392
02:45:21.72 --> 02:45:29.48
he's looking at the at this but now he has to time his firing so that when he fires it

2393
02:45:29.48 --> 02:45:38.36
as it goes it hits at the middle and and we practice that during uh during because we practice everything

2394
02:45:38.36 --> 02:45:44.44
so we practice so we've done that before but the fact is that you know that was probably one of the

2395
02:45:45.56 --> 02:45:52.12
pucker moments we had and saying yeah we we get this right because if not you you could damage the

2396
02:45:52.12 --> 02:45:58.92
docking mechanism you could get stuck or or you could just bounce off kind of thing so but but he did well

2397
02:45:58.92 --> 02:46:07.56
I mean you like the good marina pilot that he is you're fine yeah you get docks um sleeping up there

2398
02:46:07.56 --> 02:46:12.36
that sounds like it's a strange experience you got to like tie yourself into a sleeping bag base exactly

2399
02:46:12.36 --> 02:46:18.68
you what happens you got to tie the four corners of your sleeping bag to structure and then you

2400
02:46:18.68 --> 02:46:25.56
got to slide in and and you zip yourself up the the the the sleeping bags have holes so you can

2401
02:46:25.56 --> 02:46:32.36
stick your hands out and the weirdest thing is you don't need a pillow because your your your your

2402
02:46:32.36 --> 02:46:38.76
head doesn't bob right there's no weight yeah your hands whatever position your hands are

2403
02:46:38.76 --> 02:46:44.92
that's how you're sleeping you know got this cool Frankenstein pictures of my crewmates like that

2404
02:46:44.92 --> 02:46:49.16
because that's the way you sleep I mean whatever position you're in you're gonna sleep in that position

2405
02:46:49.16 --> 02:46:55.08
but I'll tell you it was the weirdest feeling going to sleep the first in second night but after that

2406
02:46:55.72 --> 02:47:01.80
I said you know this is the best sleep you can ever you know no tempered

2407
02:47:01.80 --> 02:47:07.96
you mattress nothing mattress mac and Houston can sell with respect to his mattresses

2408
02:47:08.84 --> 02:47:13.80
this is the best sleeping gear because you got no pressure us you have no pressure points

2409
02:47:13.80 --> 02:47:19.08
what's the what's the how many hours would you get to sleep for you get to sleep but it was on the

2410
02:47:19.08 --> 02:47:25.24
average about six hours and ten minutes and that's what why my sleep thing said about six hours

2411
02:47:25.24 --> 02:47:31.48
ten minutes on day eight you got this in here the eight day of the mission was very special one

2412
02:47:31.48 --> 02:47:36.28
for me Jose the interview is set up and ready you have four minutes and thirty seconds to do it

2413
02:47:36.28 --> 02:47:41.96
I was told I was delighted to hear Carlos a famous Mexican reporter who had been following my

2414
02:47:41.96 --> 02:47:46.04
story for some time truth be told I was terrified at the thought of knowing that millions of

2415
02:47:46.04 --> 02:47:50.36
people in Latin America were going to see my interview it was only after I returned and

2416
02:47:50.36 --> 02:47:55.000
conversed with him that I found out he felt the same way this was a historic interview as it was

2417
02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.36
the first live interview from space conducted in Spanish the minutes went by so quickly

2418
02:48:00.36 --> 02:48:05.72
that I felt my time was up just as I was getting started we we talked about the view of Mexico

2419
02:48:05.72 --> 02:48:12.12
from space including the attractive coast of the state of Quintana Rue and the Yucca temple

2420
02:48:12.12 --> 02:48:19.80
peninsula we also spoke about my inability to detect burp borders that defied Earth into countries

2421
02:48:19.80 --> 02:48:24.60
there are no borders from what I can see up here our world leaders should see how beautiful

2422
02:48:24.60 --> 02:48:28.84
and precious our world looks from this perspective I said to the reporter

2423
02:48:28.84 --> 02:48:37.24
one world from up there yeah you know interesting story in there Jaco with respect to what

2424
02:48:37.24 --> 02:48:43.16
happened after that you know I I basically said you know the the most beautiful

2425
02:48:43.16 --> 02:48:48.92
thing there was two things that to take away is the first one had to do with put you just mentioned

2426
02:48:48.92 --> 02:48:56.04
is that I was able to see Canada the US and Mexico but what struck me in awe and as so beautiful

2427
02:48:56.04 --> 02:49:03.24
is that we couldn't I couldn't differentiate where Canada ended the US began or where the US ended

2428
02:49:03.24 --> 02:49:11.96
in Mexico began and this ahamom and I said man I had to go out of this world to come to this conclusion

2429
02:49:12.68 --> 02:49:23.72
that down there were all just one because borders are human-made concepts designed to separate us

2430
02:49:23.72 --> 02:49:31.16
and how sad because from my perspective we're just one down there and it'd be great to have our

2431
02:49:31.72 --> 02:49:39.000
world leaders give to give them this opportunity because I'll show you a world be much better now

2432
02:49:40.04 --> 02:49:46.84
the thing that what the news got out of all this when I came home and you can look up

2433
02:49:46.84 --> 02:49:56.68
the New York Times and the LA Times came up with the headlines saying Mexican American astronaut

2434
02:49:57.40 --> 02:50:06.20
wants to open borders that's what they got out of this my star I say good good but everything has to be

2435
02:50:06.20 --> 02:50:12.28
politicized they want to get people to click on those headlines exactly and and which I found

2436
02:50:12.28 --> 02:50:17.48
it so sad because I said yeah I wasn't talking about that I was just talking about the concept that

2437
02:50:17.48 --> 02:50:23.88
we're just one down there you know and but somehow from there they got the fact that I wanted to

2438
02:50:23.88 --> 02:50:30.92
remove all borders and get let everybody come into the US what can I say that's the that's the

2439
02:50:30.92 --> 02:50:37.56
media for you yeah so again I'm gonna I'm gonna skip forward to get to read the book to get

2440
02:50:37.56 --> 02:50:43.08
some of these details about the flight day 14 on this day we made a final preparations to begin the

2441
02:50:43.08 --> 02:50:48.76
de-orbit procedures this included closing our payload bay doors and once again putting on the orange

2442
02:50:48.76 --> 02:50:54.68
LES suits for the entry phase of our flight observing the beauty of the earth from space or

2443
02:50:54.68 --> 02:50:58.92
something I have not been able to put into words well not in a way where I have felt I was able

2444
02:50:58.92 --> 02:51:04.68
to truly do justice to the spectacular view I felt goosebumps knowing that few people

2445
02:51:04.68 --> 02:51:10.36
have had the privilege of looking at our planet from my perspective I marveled at the

2446
02:51:10.36 --> 02:51:15.24
bluness of the oceans the whiteness of the clouds at one point I was able to make out the lights

2447
02:51:15.24 --> 02:51:20.20
of some cities I can see San Francisco Mexico City in Houston I managed to steal a few more

2448
02:51:20.20 --> 02:51:26.20
moments for myself while I while the rest of the crew worked without anyone noticing I made my way

2449
02:51:26.20 --> 02:51:32.20
over to a corner and pulled out the crucifix that Adelida gave me and set a prayer let us

2450
02:51:32.20 --> 02:51:39.48
Lord see your love in the world forgive us for our wrong doings give us faith to trust in your goodness

2451
02:51:39.48 --> 02:51:46.28
forgive our ignorance and weakness give us the power to continue trusting wholeheartedly

2452
02:51:46.76 --> 02:51:51.72
and show us what we can do for peace on earth amen

2453
02:51:51.72 --> 02:52:05.40
and you guys end up spending an extra time up in space and extra yes the weather was not

2454
02:52:05.40 --> 02:52:15.16
cooperating in Florida and flight rules are that if it's more than a couple of rotations around

2455
02:52:15.16 --> 02:52:21.48
the earth and you still can't land you postpone it for 24 hours and if it's still bad weather

2456
02:52:21.48 --> 02:52:26.76
you go to your second preferred landing site and so you got your second preferred landing site

2457
02:52:26.76 --> 02:52:32.36
which was California yes Edward's Air Force Base yeah yeah yeah and which was

2458
02:52:33.24 --> 02:52:36.60
kind of nice because you were going to land in California but also your family wasn't going to be there

2459
02:52:36.60 --> 02:52:43.48
yes yes my family was waiting for me in in Florida because they wanted to witness the landing in

2460
02:52:43.48 --> 02:52:50.52
person and of course once it got canceled they didn't have enough time to fly and meet us over here

2461
02:52:50.52 --> 02:52:55.64
at Edward's Air Force Base but I kind of liked it because you know it's California and

2462
02:52:55.64 --> 02:53:03.32
I'm landing at Edward's Air Force Base I call it poetic justice because it's it's some 80 miles

2463
02:53:03.32 --> 02:53:11.000
from Chino on Terrier where I used to pick strawberries so here here I am coming in with a

2464
02:53:12.28 --> 02:53:17.16
you know in a NASA space suit I did a good old American flag on my shoulder and coming in as a

2465
02:53:17.16 --> 02:53:25.64
US NASA astronaut when you know 40 years ago I was you know over there picking strawberries

2466
02:53:25.64 --> 02:53:36.04
oh man this landing was no joke too I mean you describe it here as each minute past the distance

2467
02:53:36.04 --> 02:53:40.28
between our shuttle and earth lesson the planet also grew bigger in size before our very eyes

2468
02:53:40.28 --> 02:53:43.96
which meant that we were getting close to the home in my mind I was counting down the minutes

2469
02:53:43.96 --> 02:53:48.84
until we were safely on the ground our landing pointed Edward's Air Force Base in California was

2470
02:53:48.84 --> 02:53:55.80
a mere dot on our map as discovery darted across the sky at high speed I saw in our instruments

2471
02:53:55.80 --> 02:54:03.08
that we broke mock 25 at that point we were traveling at slightly more than 25 times the speed

2472
02:54:03.08 --> 02:54:08.52
is sound I could feel the buffeting of this shuttle with the atmosphere and I noticed an orange

2473
02:54:08.52 --> 02:54:14.84
glow outside our windows we were definitely in the atmosphere now I noticed gravity slowly taking

2474
02:54:14.84 --> 02:54:19.72
its effect as the weight of my helmet attached to my orange LES became heavier

2475
02:54:19.72 --> 02:54:24.52
out of 26,000 feet we broke through the cloud layer and I had a good view of the ground

2476
02:54:24.52 --> 02:54:28.68
both below us and in front of us by now the shuttle had the characteristics of an airplane

2477
02:54:28.68 --> 02:54:34.68
as the aerodynamic surface controls were responding to the commanders input the shuttle slowed

2478
02:54:34.68 --> 02:54:39.72
down to normal airplane speeds and behave more like a glider would since it did not have an

2479
02:54:39.72 --> 02:54:45.24
active propulsion system during the landing phase of the flight this of course meant we only had

2480
02:54:45.24 --> 02:54:49.72
one opportunity to land it our commander in pilot had practiced these landing hundreds if not

2481
02:54:49.72 --> 02:54:54.52
thousands of times in simulators and in actual approaches utilizing one of the two planes that have

2482
02:54:54.52 --> 02:55:02.04
been modified to be able to fly the shuttle's landing profile at 400 feet with the gear already armed

2483
02:55:02.04 --> 02:55:09.08
our pilot Kevin activated the gear down command this poised the wheels of the shuttle for contact

2484
02:55:09.08 --> 02:55:14.60
with the surface of the pavement at Edwards Air Force Base in preparation for landing the landing

2485
02:55:14.60 --> 02:55:20.92
strip was ready in no time soon thereafter we were literally racing down the landing strip until

2486
02:55:20.92 --> 02:55:26.92
the parachute deployed and the pedal breaks slowly brought us to a complete stop

2487
02:55:26.92 --> 02:55:33.64
the opening of the shuttle doors reminding me of the times I had to open them to welcome back

2488
02:55:33.64 --> 02:55:39.000
the returning astronauts however this time I would be welcomed and indeed we were a welcome

2489
02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:44.76
back I was told by one of my class colleagues as he unbuckled my seat we padded one another on the back

2490
02:55:45.32 --> 02:55:50.36
once I was able to stand up I exited the shuttle with a smile on my face the seven of us crew

2491
02:55:50.36 --> 02:55:54.76
members were beyond ecstatic everything one is planned our mission commander began to congratulate

2492
02:55:54.76 --> 02:56:00.12
us and said we did it we couldn't have asked for a better team all of us had to spend an extra

2493
02:56:00.12 --> 02:56:04.84
day on the base before we were able to go home as I waited for the moment when I could go back

2494
02:56:04.84 --> 02:56:11.40
to Houston I could not fathom the irony of my dream going into space both beginning in and

2495
02:56:11.40 --> 02:56:18.20
concluding in the golden state as a boy I dreamed of becoming an astronaut as I picked crops

2496
02:56:18.20 --> 02:56:23.96
as a man I would exit the shuttle as an astronaut on a landing strip located just a few miles

2497
02:56:23.96 --> 02:56:31.40
from where I grew up picking strawberries it was poetic really there was truly this delightful

2498
02:56:31.40 --> 02:56:37.64
symmetry to my life that helped me realize the importance of remaining humble and remembering

2499
02:56:37.64 --> 02:56:50.68
where I came from epic and the story goes on here you go on to talk about retiring from NASA

2500
02:56:50.68 --> 02:56:57.72
going into the corporate world as an executive you let me tell you a little bit about the retirement

2501
02:56:57.72 --> 02:57:06.44
part of it it was a hard decision to to go about and deciding juggle because I'll tell you

2502
02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:16.28
I remember when we've got back from from space shortly thereafter they announced the retirement

2503
02:57:16.28 --> 02:57:22.92
of the shuttle fleet so they were going to retire the whole space shuttle program I think they had

2504
02:57:22.92 --> 02:57:29.96
four or five flights more manifested and then after that program's over and but they had them all

2505
02:57:29.96 --> 02:57:35.56
assigned so because they assigned about four or five crews ahead because they're training already

2506
02:57:35.56 --> 02:57:40.76
for the next flight or they're going to get ready to train and so I knew you know since I just

2507
02:57:40.76 --> 02:57:45.48
got back I'm in the back of the line right of the queue so I knew I wasn't going to get a

2508
02:57:45.48 --> 02:57:52.76
assigned another mission but then I was one of the prime candidates what we were going to be flying

2509
02:57:52.76 --> 02:57:58.28
is and we were flying already was with the Russians all right pay the Russians $50 million per

2510
02:57:58.28 --> 02:58:06.68
seat and we go up on the Soyuz and they'll take you to the station so so I was one of the prime

2511
02:58:06.68 --> 02:58:12.52
candidates because of my background of traveling in Russia for five years in knowing Russian and all

2512
02:58:12.52 --> 02:58:19.08
that and I thought okay well I'm going to be one of the first ones I'm down for that out to that

2513
02:58:19.72 --> 02:58:26.60
but then you read the fine print and you read the fine print and what you don't realize is that the

2514
02:58:27.64 --> 02:58:33.96
training in Russia it's a three year training program and so 80% of the time you're in Russia

2515
02:58:33.96 --> 02:58:38.52
and it's not continuous it's like you go six weeks you come back one week you go eight weeks

2516
02:58:38.52 --> 02:58:43.16
come back one week you go 12 weeks come back two weeks kind of thing like that for three years

2517
02:58:44.36 --> 02:58:50.84
and and then you go up for six months continuous and then when you come back you go on the

2518
02:58:50.84 --> 02:58:57.80
road for six months continuous devolving everything all the science you did so and all in all it was

2519
02:58:57.80 --> 02:59:05.32
a four year ordeal where you were going to be gone about 90% of the time, 85% of the time

2520
02:59:05.32 --> 02:59:14.20
from home and I got five kids my oldest at that time was 15 years old and the youngest was about

2521
02:59:14.20 --> 02:59:20.12
seven years old and so I did the map and I said you know all these kids I'm going to miss

2522
02:59:21.16 --> 02:59:27.80
you know their you know their boy scout their softball baseball prompts high school graduation

2523
02:59:28.76 --> 02:59:33.48
you know this 15 years going to be 19 year already off in college I at least I assume he's going to

2524
02:59:33.48 --> 02:59:39.000
go to college I'm not going to be around to find out you're too guide him and so so quickly I think

2525
02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:49.80
my Hispanic culture kind of kicked in and and I gave a lot of weight to the family and I'll tell

2526
02:59:49.80 --> 02:59:56.60
you man it was the hardest decision in my life because you know we just got through reading

2527
02:59:56.60 --> 03:00:05.32
what it took to get here to get there to get assigned and to be part of NASA and after flying only once

2528
03:00:05.72 --> 03:00:15.000
here I am considering chucking it all the way because I could fly again but you know I kind of just

2529
03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:21.88
thought about it, prayed about it I didn't want to talk to my wife about it because I know her answer is

2530
03:00:21.88 --> 03:00:27.96
we can do it we can do it I didn't want her to convince me I said you know this is you know there's

2531
03:00:27.96 --> 03:00:36.44
there's a fine line where you know you do it for what you want to do for you and then that fine line

2532
03:00:36.44 --> 03:00:45.64
of being more equal testical than you know not considering other folks and so you know I thought

2533
03:00:45.64 --> 03:00:51.16
about it thought about it and finally I said you know I think the best thing for me to do is to just

2534
03:00:51.16 --> 03:00:57.64
leave give someone else an opportunity you can fly I mean I could stay and not fly but I'm taking

2535
03:00:57.64 --> 03:01:03.64
up a billet I said that's not fair either I said it's probably best for me to leave and give someone

2536
03:01:03.64 --> 03:01:09.96
else I said give the Johnny's of the world a chance Johnny can't see exactly give the Johnny

2537
03:01:09.96 --> 03:01:15.48
Kim's of the world and opportunity so they can fly and so it was the hardest decision

2538
03:01:15.48 --> 03:01:23.72
that I could have made but you know I look back at it and I look at world my kids are right in

2539
03:01:23.72 --> 03:01:29.24
life right now all college graduates my young seven year old is a freshman in mechanical engineering

2540
03:01:29.24 --> 03:01:35.72
at UC Merced you know the PhD my three girls have their bachelor's one of them is finishing

2541
03:01:35.72 --> 03:01:45.80
our masters in me and one of them is a big influencer in in in TikTok you know maybe and if you

2542
03:01:45.80 --> 03:01:54.68
guys really want to have a laugh because I come on a lot she feels me a lot go at the Vanessa Hernandez

2543
03:01:54.68 --> 03:02:01.000
okay and you'll see you'll see her you'll see me make a full of myself but you know anything

2544
03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:06.20
for my daughter you know if you're not doing TikTok dances are you or are you oh you got to look at

2545
03:02:06.20 --> 03:02:11.24
it man all kinds of stuff I'm telling you all kinds of she graduate from the you truly will do anything

2546
03:02:11.24 --> 03:02:16.68
for your family exactly to talk to him is she graduate from La Yola Merimont and she works for a

2547
03:02:17.32 --> 03:02:23.72
vitamin pharmaceutical company near La Yola Merimont so she still lives in the LA area and

2548
03:02:23.72 --> 03:02:28.84
but she's been she's been you know doing social media stuff and she's gonna start her own podcast

2549
03:02:28.84 --> 03:02:33.96
too today already contacted her before just start but but she's been doing good on TikTok and she

2550
03:02:33.96 --> 03:02:39.24
she represents a few companies in TikTok and she's I think she's banking more on TikTok than she

2551
03:02:39.24 --> 03:02:45.08
isn't her day job you know and working a lot less so but yeah but it's those decisions you know

2552
03:02:45.08 --> 03:02:52.28
that I think you know I really you know I look back at it and I don't regret it because I look

2553
03:02:52.28 --> 03:02:57.24
at how my kids turn out because I've been here for them and I continue to be there for them

2554
03:02:57.24 --> 03:03:04.12
and so I think I made the right decision well that's definitely a difficult decision to make I know

2555
03:03:04.12 --> 03:03:09.16
I was in the military and that's the the decision that military individuals like myself have to

2556
03:03:09.16 --> 03:03:12.60
make at some point are you gonna keep going you're gonna keep going on the point you're

2557
03:03:12.60 --> 03:03:16.92
you're talking about missing all those things I missed all those things I missed everything you know

2558
03:03:16.92 --> 03:03:24.52
and eventually had to say I owe I owe a little something I've done what I can for the country I owe

2559
03:03:24.52 --> 03:03:29.32
something that's the family that I've left behind for months and months and months and months at a time so

2560
03:03:30.12 --> 03:03:34.92
that's I agree the that's you know people ask me what's the toughest decision you ever made in the

2561
03:03:34.92 --> 03:03:39.08
military and they think I'm gonna say some tactical situation or some mission it was like no

2562
03:03:39.64 --> 03:03:44.68
deciding to get out was the thing that I fought the most about and it was the hardest decision I had to

2563
03:03:44.68 --> 03:03:48.68
make and then people tell me well didn't you know you could go on in why did you go on in the

2564
03:03:48.68 --> 03:03:53.80
first place I said no that the rules were changed midstream I mean they decided to retire the

2565
03:03:53.80 --> 03:03:58.36
space shuttle fleet I mean I I thought the space shuttle fleet you know they told me it was

2566
03:03:58.36 --> 03:04:03.48
gonna be going on for another 10 20 years and I would have got another three four flights under my belt

2567
03:04:03.48 --> 03:04:08.36
but when you take that away and they say hey the only gaming townhouse with the Russians for the next

2568
03:04:08.36 --> 03:04:14.52
10 years I figured you know I think it's time for me to leave then if you guys change the rules and

2569
03:04:14.52 --> 03:04:20.20
I value my family as much as I do and I think they need me at this point in their life pre-teenage

2570
03:04:20.20 --> 03:04:25.24
years I mean that's the most important part of a kid's growing up stage and you know I think

2571
03:04:25.24 --> 03:04:30.84
it's a job where both parents have to be present and you know thumbs on on them to make sure

2572
03:04:30.84 --> 03:04:35.48
that they just like my parents were with me make sure that they're you know on the straight

2573
03:04:35.48 --> 03:04:42.84
narrow go ahead and in the right direction yeah and then you ended up getting a job in in the

2574
03:04:42.84 --> 03:04:51.80
corporate world you ended up running for Congress yes yes I get I get I get I get I get

2575
03:04:51.80 --> 03:04:58.52
uh come vent well they convinced me to run for Congress and it was uh you know that's a long story

2576
03:04:58.52 --> 03:05:07.64
in itself too but but it was at the urging of president Obama you know he he sought me out not once

2577
03:05:07.64 --> 03:05:14.44
not twice but three times and when you get sought out the third time your commander and chief

2578
03:05:15.08 --> 03:05:21.08
straight out tells you the first two times he says you ought to consider it and the third time he

2579
03:05:21.08 --> 03:05:27.88
says he he told me and I quote I'm gonna make the ask that said please run for Congress in California

2580
03:05:28.36 --> 03:05:33.88
so when the commander and chiefs there's at you in the eyes and says run for Congress what you do

2581
03:05:33.88 --> 03:05:41.64
you salute the flag and so so I did you know I gave it my best we we were um they didn't put me in my

2582
03:05:41.64 --> 03:05:48.44
district because my district is I'm a Democrats or my district is heavy Democrat but we already had

2583
03:05:48.44 --> 03:05:56.28
someone there that had seniority so why why not call for a seniority level Democrat and put a

2584
03:05:56.28 --> 03:06:05.24
freshman there why not go after a Republican seat so they sent me next door at the time they

2585
03:06:05.24 --> 03:06:12.60
were plus 11 in registration and we lost by one and a half points so we almost made it but

2586
03:06:13.40 --> 03:06:18.20
but it left the bad taste in the mouth you know I have the exam imagine the taste that left in your

2587
03:06:18.20 --> 03:06:23.56
right yeah politics you know it's kind of like you know I just don't have you know I have the

2588
03:06:23.56 --> 03:06:30.76
stomach for a lot of things but but when it's stuff like that it's kind of like there's no rules

2589
03:06:30.76 --> 03:06:36.12
and you know there's a script I mean it's just like no ethics at all and I said you know that's not me

2590
03:06:37.40 --> 03:06:43.24
so one shot was enough at that one I think for now never say never never say never jockel but

2591
03:06:43.24 --> 03:06:52.28
but but for now it's it's I think I'm doing okay where I'm at right now yeah um now you know you

2592
03:06:52.28 --> 03:06:57.56
to go around you know you do speaking events right now and and you talk about that a little bit

2593
03:06:57.56 --> 03:07:00.84
of here now I want to close out you know we've covered some of the book but I wanted to close out

2594
03:07:00.84 --> 03:07:05.32
the book with this this little section where you talk about what you talk about you say I share with

2595
03:07:05.32 --> 03:07:10.92
everyone the magical recipe for success that I applied to my own life is a recipe that I learned

2596
03:07:10.92 --> 03:07:18.84
from my parents and I also shared here with you one identify your golden life two realize and

2597
03:07:18.84 --> 03:07:28.12
understand how far you are away from that goal three develop a road map to get there don't skip steps

2598
03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:36.68
for get yourself a good education consistent with your goal five develop a good work ethic

2599
03:07:36.68 --> 03:07:42.84
and put your heart into reaching your goal six and this is the one you added you mentioned earlier

2600
03:07:42.84 --> 03:07:48.36
exemplify perseverance never give up on your dream and remember that it is the journey

2601
03:07:48.36 --> 03:07:56.12
not the destination that is of most importance then you continue on these are not the steps to become

2602
03:07:56.12 --> 03:08:03.80
an astronaut these are the steps to harvest your own stars the recipe works for anyone in any

2603
03:08:03.80 --> 03:08:11.72
part of the world and trust me it's in fallible so that's what you go around talking about yes

2604
03:08:11.72 --> 03:08:20.92
I'm a motivational speaker and I share my story and also that recipe and talk and talk about what

2605
03:08:20.92 --> 03:08:30.04
what it took to get there and like a good engineer I try to try to basically capture it in a

2606
03:08:30.04 --> 03:08:37.56
formula type of environment like the recipe that you just read off there I also give a three

2607
03:08:37.56 --> 03:08:44.52
element strategy that says hey to reach your goal you've got to you've got to and this I learned

2608
03:08:44.52 --> 03:08:50.52
afterwards right is you got to know what the minimum requirements are once you define your goal

2609
03:08:50.52 --> 03:08:59.08
is natural tendency and 99.9% of us get this right is you ask yourself what are the requirements

2610
03:08:59.08 --> 03:09:02.92
to get there you want to be a doctor you know you got to go to medical pre-med medical school

2611
03:09:02.92 --> 03:09:07.96
and pass the boards lawyer pre-law law passed the bar astronaut you know you got to go to the

2612
03:09:07.96 --> 03:09:13.64
STEM field get graduate degree four or five years experience and then start applying so that's the

2613
03:09:13.64 --> 03:09:20.28
first one everyone gets that one you know it's it's no the requirement second one is emulate

2614
03:09:20.28 --> 03:09:28.28
successful people that you want to aspire to be like in other words you know ask yourself

2615
03:09:28.28 --> 03:09:36.12
what do they have that I don't have you know if you want to be a CEO study a CEO and study find

2616
03:09:36.12 --> 03:09:40.12
out how they got there you want to be an astronaut study an astronaut I mean that's what I did after

2617
03:09:40.12 --> 03:09:46.20
my six our failure remember I'd compare myself I found out they were all pilots so what did I

2618
03:09:46.20 --> 03:09:51.08
do I invested in myself I became a pilot then I found out they were all school but certified what did

2619
03:09:51.08 --> 03:10:01.96
I do I invested in myself and became school certified the third stage of that of that strategy

2620
03:10:02.92 --> 03:10:11.32
is is you got to create a differentiator in other words differentiate yourself from

2621
03:10:12.20 --> 03:10:18.12
differentiate yourself from the competition you know at that the time you know it was from 4,000

2622
03:10:18.12 --> 03:10:26.12
and went up to 12,000 that I had a differentiate myself so it was no accident that I took that

2623
03:10:26.12 --> 03:10:32.12
job going to Russia it was strategic in my career I say it's going to help my career obviously

2624
03:10:32.52 --> 03:10:38.76
but it's also going to help me over here because you know I just read that the US and the newly

2625
03:10:38.76 --> 03:10:42.92
form Russia signing agreement to build what was going to be the international space station so

2626
03:10:42.92 --> 03:10:47.000
he didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out even though I am one you are one you know I am one

2627
03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:50.28
I didn't take a rocket scientist figure out we were going to be working with the Russians

2628
03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:56.28
so my great differentiator is during these next five years in this project I'm like I traveled

2629
03:10:56.28 --> 03:11:02.52
more than 25 times through the Russian Siberian countryside and work with the Russians and all this

2630
03:11:03.40 --> 03:11:11.96
you know help me get the upper hand on the other 14, 12,000 applicants

2631
03:11:11.96 --> 03:11:19.48
because very few of them could save or claim similar experience than what I had and at least that

2632
03:11:19.48 --> 03:11:24.04
got me in the door to get started getting interviewed and then the rest I would just sell myself

2633
03:11:25.48 --> 03:11:31.96
so yeah so that's the three element strategy that I had up up to that and so that's what you're

2634
03:11:31.96 --> 03:11:38.44
doing now now you got your foundation the reaching the stars foundation yes that AstroJH.org

2635
03:11:38.44 --> 03:11:48.04
you'll see everything we do in the Central Valley where we try to motivate kids to get interested

2636
03:11:48.04 --> 03:11:54.36
in STEM careers science technology engineering math we have a summer academy at the University of

2637
03:11:54.36 --> 03:12:03.56
Pacific same school I went to where we have kids from the seventh to 12th grade in the six week

2638
03:12:03.56 --> 03:12:11.000
summer program where we basically inundate them with STEM concepts fun STEM concepts that they can

2639
03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:18.84
take back to their school and get ahead start in their math and science courses they're going to

2640
03:12:18.84 --> 03:12:23.16
see the following year so we we basically expose them to those concepts that we know they're

2641
03:12:23.16 --> 03:12:28.92
good we know what the core curriculum is so we expose them to those ideas in a fun experimental

2642
03:12:28.92 --> 03:12:33.80
experiential way so that when they go back to school they said oh yeah I've seen this it's my

2643
03:12:33.80 --> 03:12:39.96
fact I know the experiment and so they do very well and so we we do that for them and then and then

2644
03:12:39.96 --> 03:12:45.96
we we also have a science class where we get over a thousand kids in the fifth grade

2645
03:12:47.40 --> 03:12:55.24
to in a one day exploratory type of environment where we have all kinds of hands on

2646
03:12:55.24 --> 03:13:00.44
experiments we have people from Lawrence live a more lab from Google from Apple come

2647
03:13:00.44 --> 03:13:06.60
and they talk about what their careers are and basically you know exposing to STEM careers

2648
03:13:06.60 --> 03:13:11.80
and why we do that at fifth grade because that's the age when I decided I want to be an astronaut

2649
03:13:11.80 --> 03:13:15.80
so I think if it's good enough for me it's good enough for them and then now whatever

2650
03:13:15.80 --> 03:13:20.84
money we have left over because we we sort of have on a year to year budget whatever

2651
03:13:20.84 --> 03:13:26.60
money we really have left over we give scholarships to the kids so no that's awesome I know

2652
03:13:28.60 --> 03:13:33.48
you know that's what American needs American needs kids that are growing up that want to

2653
03:13:33.48 --> 03:13:39.48
learn STEM yes we need lots of engineers scientists yeah that's that's the that's the competition

2654
03:13:39.48 --> 03:13:44.52
for you shine is and shine is are all India are kicking our butts and producing more scientists

2655
03:13:44.52 --> 03:13:47.96
and engineers than we are and that's gonna cost us yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2656
03:13:47.96 --> 03:13:52.60
and 10 years from now 20 years from now it's gonna cost us if we don't if we don't

2657
03:13:52.60 --> 03:13:58.68
rectify the situation yeah I know I I can find myself sometimes being pretty down on the

2658
03:13:59.40 --> 03:14:05.000
academia right for people that are going to the debt and they're they're born all this money

2659
03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:09.40
to go to college but they get a degree that doesn't really give them a job you know they'll

2660
03:14:09.40 --> 03:14:14.52
get a degree in something that doesn't you can't go you don't have a skill set I mean engineering

2661
03:14:14.52 --> 03:14:18.68
is a skill set yeah something that you learn something you not to do so the fact that you're doing

2662
03:14:18.68 --> 03:14:23.80
that that that program is leaning kids in the right direction for something that can actually

2663
03:14:24.36 --> 03:14:29.24
provide not only them with a good career but also provides America with something that we desperately

2664
03:14:29.24 --> 03:14:35.80
need and we're just we're gonna need even more in the future and on top of all that you also have

2665
03:14:35.80 --> 03:14:42.36
a winery right well well first of all you know all that is just volunteer you know we I get

2666
03:14:42.36 --> 03:14:48.12
nothing happening right except but you still have to put it together yeah yeah yeah it's a

2667
03:14:48.12 --> 03:14:52.76
time scene yeah right but unpaid time scene I'll say on top of all the time you spend doing that

2668
03:14:52.76 --> 03:15:00.68
and all the time you spend speaking you also but before the winery I also have a engineering consulting

2669
03:15:00.68 --> 03:15:07.80
this case first yeah I have a Tierra Luna engineering where I do aerospace consulting you know for

2670
03:15:07.80 --> 03:15:14.44
example I help Mexico a buy and launch three communications satellites from Boeing Corporation

2671
03:15:14.44 --> 03:15:22.76
I was at 1.2 billion dollar purchase for Mexico and they hired me because the under secretary

2672
03:15:22.76 --> 03:15:29.56
of communications was he himself at midday he says look I'm an economist politician economist I

2673
03:15:29.56 --> 03:15:36.28
know did least quite about satellites and here we are spending 1.2 billion dollars can you help us so

2674
03:15:36.28 --> 03:15:43.48
I worked on a neat project for about four years helping them launch three communications satellites

2675
03:15:43.48 --> 03:15:49.08
so they they can have internet throughout all of Mexico any population over 5,000 the

2676
03:15:49.08 --> 03:15:54.84
government put a dish so they would have connectivity to the outside world which is which is

2677
03:15:54.84 --> 03:16:02.60
pretty neat so I do that you know I've also helped a university build a Cube set small satellite

2678
03:16:02.60 --> 03:16:09.24
10 by 10 by 10 centimeters and with NASA we launched it for free for them and they became the first

2679
03:16:09.24 --> 03:16:16.68
university in Mexico to have built design and keyword operated their own satellite from space

2680
03:16:16.68 --> 03:16:23.16
so we did that for them I'm helping I also created an aerospace curriculum for them

2681
03:16:23.72 --> 03:16:29.32
working with a three campus university in northern Mexico and that's Tierra Luna engineering

2682
03:16:29.32 --> 03:16:35.96
work which by the way if you go to the dot com store there Tierra Luna engineering dot com

2683
03:16:35.96 --> 03:16:41.48
you can actually get the book reaching for the stars you can get the children's book there

2684
03:16:41.48 --> 03:16:47.88
and you can buy an Amazon and quite frankly you can probably buy a little cheaper but if you buy

2685
03:16:47.88 --> 03:16:53.32
it through our website you'll guarantee that I can sign it and dedicate whatever you want me to say on it

2686
03:16:53.32 --> 03:16:59.32
I'll dedicate it and the proceeds go to my foundation so that's why I want to make sure you

2687
03:16:59.32 --> 03:17:04.28
clarify that you know I think it's like 30 bucks for the book or something like that but it's signed

2688
03:17:04.28 --> 03:17:11.48
by me and we send it off and so you can do that at Tierra Luna engineering dot com and then as

2689
03:17:12.76 --> 03:17:20.28
if that wasn't enough I kind of come full circle and my wife wanted a back to the field exactly

2690
03:17:20.28 --> 03:17:28.20
my wife wanted a home out in the country and so about five years ago you know when we were

2691
03:17:28.20 --> 03:17:35.16
well down and established back in stockton I started looking for some property because yeah you

2692
03:17:35.16 --> 03:17:40.36
happy wife happy life right and so I started looking for some from property so that we can build a

2693
03:17:40.36 --> 03:17:44.44
house out in the country because she wants living in the country and I said yeah okay I'm a country boy too

2694
03:17:44.44 --> 03:17:53.08
and man I saw the price and they were expensive and then I ran into this 28 year vineyard

2695
03:17:54.04 --> 03:18:01.80
and it was encompassing and it was only about twice as much as an empty three acre lot in the country

2696
03:18:01.80 --> 03:18:06.12
too. That's him as a no-brainer I'm gonna I'm gonna become a farmer.

2697
03:18:07.32 --> 03:18:13.40
Back to my roots and back to the fields and I became a a grave

2698
03:18:13.40 --> 03:18:20.68
farmer and the reason why I was so into it was because first of all I know how to pick grapes

2699
03:18:20.68 --> 03:18:25.48
but that's the only thing I know I don't know like did least go out about about running a vineyard

2700
03:18:25.48 --> 03:18:31.48
but you know who does my dad my dad's worked in there all his life and so I told pop

2701
03:18:31.48 --> 03:18:36.04
that so we can't pop that's that told pop say if I buy this vineyard would you teach me how to

2702
03:18:36.76 --> 03:18:43.16
run the vineyard you say yes so these past five years with him you know he's 84 strong

2703
03:18:43.16 --> 03:18:48.12
man it's good you know field work background he's strong and healthy you know this is the best

2704
03:18:48.12 --> 03:18:55.24
five years I spent with him quality time he's teaching me you know what to fertilize how to fertilize

2705
03:18:56.04 --> 03:19:02.60
one water and you know he gets up on the tractor and he plows and mows and all kinds of stuff

2706
03:19:02.60 --> 03:19:10.76
that he does it helped me with the vineyard and and and and we sell all the grapes to a winery that

2707
03:19:10.76 --> 03:19:16.92
makes a champ it was sparkling wine can caught champagne in California sparkling wine right and

2708
03:19:16.92 --> 03:19:22.60
it's it's it's it's corbell so we sell it to them but then they make the mistake of one day

2709
03:19:22.60 --> 03:19:29.88
inviting me to see their processes and I saw how they engineered mine starts going on exactly I

2710
03:19:29.88 --> 03:19:35.56
started looking at the process of how they make wine and you know my favorite phrases hey this ain't

2711
03:19:35.56 --> 03:19:43.64
rocket science I could make this I could make this probably more efficiently to you exactly and so

2712
03:19:43.64 --> 03:19:49.24
so I started you know a couple years ago I started working with my own formulations and making my own

2713
03:19:49.24 --> 03:19:56.92
wine and finally I settled on three concoctions that that we have and so I started my company again

2714
03:19:56.92 --> 03:20:02.52
everything under Tierra Luna members Tierra Luna engineering remember my wife's restaurant and it was

2715
03:20:02.52 --> 03:20:07.88
called Tierra Luna grill yeah when we came in California and I opened up Tierra Luna engineering I

2716
03:20:07.88 --> 03:20:13.16
handed a dollar to my wife so what's this for I saw I'm buying your naming rights I'll be right

2717
03:20:13.16 --> 03:20:18.20
now the funk restaurant because you know we hear you close the down here here's here's the dollar

2718
03:20:18.20 --> 03:20:24.92
I'm gonna call Tierra Luna engineering and then after that I opened another company called Tierra Luna

2719
03:20:24.92 --> 03:20:33.64
sellers that's with a C C L L A R S sellers dot com and then that's where I I sell my wine now

2720
03:20:34.20 --> 03:20:41.96
this is the first year we came out with it it's a direct to consumer and hopefully we'll end up

2721
03:20:41.96 --> 03:20:46.76
being in stores and stuff later on when we have production but we're right now we're just

2722
03:20:46.76 --> 03:20:53.000
getting it out there and getting it known and and we have you know we have three varieties you know

2723
03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:58.36
we have a Sauvignon block which has my grapes so if you want to drink wine from my vineyard

2724
03:20:59.40 --> 03:21:08.12
you'll see that Sauvignon block is the one to go and then I buy grapes from Lodai and I make a red

2725
03:21:08.12 --> 03:21:15.64
zimfendale which is also good and then I buy grapes from from anapa area and I make a red blend

2726
03:21:15.64 --> 03:21:23.96
that's a combination of of Merlot, Tempranillo, Siro and Petizero and we call that the red blend

2727
03:21:23.96 --> 03:21:29.40
and then I named them after constellations because the the companies called Tierra Luna sellers

2728
03:21:29.40 --> 03:21:36.68
but like the first one I ever made was with my grapes so I call it a new star which is Nova Stella

2729
03:21:36.68 --> 03:21:47.16
and in Latin Nova Stella and then the Zimfendale call it Stella Zee, you know Zee constellation

2730
03:21:47.72 --> 03:21:56.60
and then the red blend I call it Stella Roja this is red star right and so so but yeah

2731
03:21:56.60 --> 03:22:02.92
you know it's it's a great is a great activity I enjoy it you know it's kind of like another challenge

2732
03:22:02.92 --> 03:22:08.84
that you know you start from nothing and you create the labels you create the formulation and

2733
03:22:08.84 --> 03:22:13.32
I'll send you got this nice bottle and said you know I'm the one that created this this is so cool

2734
03:22:13.88 --> 03:22:19.56
and so so it's this is in Joe I love doing this I love doing this yeah that's uh

2735
03:22:20.60 --> 03:22:26.12
you're just getting warmed up I guess I guess oh yes yes and and then and then to top it off you know

2736
03:22:26.12 --> 03:22:33.24
my son my youngest son I told you it's going to use him or say it right he got accepted to

2737
03:22:33.24 --> 03:22:38.20
the University of Pacific and he got accepted to UC Santa Barbara amongst other schools but the

2738
03:22:38.20 --> 03:22:47.16
three he liked was UC Santa Barbara University of Pacific and UC Merced and I was certain

2739
03:22:47.16 --> 03:22:55.16
he was going to pick Pacific or Santa Barbara but he picks UC Merced and I told him why son

2740
03:22:55.16 --> 03:22:59.32
I said why did you pick it's fine I said you go wherever you want but I'm curious why did you pick

2741
03:22:59.32 --> 03:23:05.08
UC Merced he said well these are the schools that are student centric in other words they

2742
03:23:05.08 --> 03:23:11.000
don't focus too much on research but focus on the students success and so I liked all these three

2743
03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:16.84
schools I said with them but why it's some her said well the tipping point was in Pacific

2744
03:23:16.84 --> 03:23:29.24
uh it says my brother and you are alumni that's true and at UC Santa Barbara my sister and you are alumni

2745
03:23:29.88 --> 03:23:36.12
I said yeah so so you know I'm gonna always be known as you know the brother or the sister or the

2746
03:23:36.12 --> 03:23:45.40
son of saying I want to come in form my own you know create my own route that's a one I

2747
03:23:45.40 --> 03:23:52.60
respect that I think that's fine so the Friday Saturday we were supposed to move him in

2748
03:23:53.48 --> 03:23:57.64
all right and this is a few months back when the semester was starting we were supposed to move

2749
03:23:57.64 --> 03:24:03.72
him in this storm and everything and but the Friday before one day before I get a call from

2750
03:24:03.72 --> 03:24:12.60
the governor's office and says you've been appointed as a UC Regent so now I'm a UC Regent

2751
03:24:12.60 --> 03:24:19.40
you know overseeing the 10 UC campuses the national labs Lawrence Livermore Lab is

2752
03:24:19.40 --> 03:24:26.12
fun falls under my purview also so so so so so we go the next day Saturday I thought nothing

2753
03:24:26.12 --> 03:24:30.76
I said oh thank you very much I appreciate you say I accept and all that so the following

2754
03:24:30.76 --> 03:24:39.16
day I go and with my son and my wife and there we are moving him in and as we're moving him in

2755
03:24:39.16 --> 03:24:45.72
along comes the chancellor his assistant the photographer he's taking pictures with my son in the

2756
03:24:45.72 --> 03:24:52.12
high because I'm the new Regent you know and my son looks up well he looks down on me because he's

2757
03:24:52.12 --> 03:24:57.24
taller me he looks down on me he says I'm never gonna get rid of you and I said no you're not

2758
03:24:58.76 --> 03:25:07.32
so so I'm also on the UC board of Regents impressive man impressive well look we're going on

2759
03:25:07.32 --> 03:25:12.12
I think over three hours right now three and a half yeah three and a half that time flies

2760
03:25:12.12 --> 03:25:17.56
doesn't stop it does indeed that that's probably your typical way in every way anyway yeah around three

2761
03:25:17.56 --> 03:25:23.000
some between three before yeah yeah something okay I'm glad I had enough material to at least meet

2762
03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:32.52
the norms here you met the minimum required it's just it's a fascinating story and it's just

2763
03:25:32.52 --> 03:25:37.24
unbelievably here you got any final questions just an incredible story thanks yeah

2764
03:25:37.24 --> 03:25:41.32
thanks for sharing all the lessons from from from your dad and from your story I mean it's just

2765
03:25:41.32 --> 03:25:45.40
incredible man thank you yeah oh the one thing I miss young remember I told you not to let me

2766
03:25:45.40 --> 03:25:49.80
yes oh yeah yeah miss yeah it's just about to remind you okay don't worry

2767
03:25:49.80 --> 03:25:56.36
yeah yeah good good glad I'm glad you reminded me I'm glad you got forgot I've dropped the ball

2768
03:25:58.12 --> 03:26:05.08
with miss young you know one of the things is when you go off on the mission you get to invite

2769
03:26:05.08 --> 03:26:11.40
a hundred people in the VIP section that's about you know about five six miles from the launch

2770
03:26:11.40 --> 03:26:17.88
pads so that's pretty close to and for a Hispanic family it's like okay which of my cousins

2771
03:26:17.88 --> 03:26:24.36
aren't coming right who's so hard but but thank god I had Caucasian crewmates I didn't have

2772
03:26:24.36 --> 03:26:31.80
had 100 relatives so I was able to siphon off week I was able to siphon off a bunch of tickets

2773
03:26:31.80 --> 03:26:39.16
and so I had the school district look up miss young and miss bail now I couldn't look up

2774
03:26:39.16 --> 03:26:45.32
missters and they have because he passed away in a car accident but but I I the three most

2775
03:26:45.32 --> 03:26:52.12
important teachers and also Mr. Rodriguez he also passed away of cancer so two of two of them were

2776
03:26:52.12 --> 03:27:00.84
gone and and and so I looked them up and I had them invited and flown they were sitting next to

2777
03:27:00.84 --> 03:27:06.44
my parents both miss bail and miss young we're sitting next to my parents witnessing and

2778
03:27:06.44 --> 03:27:12.44
real life there a lot of the space shuttle and and the impact that they had on me you know I thought

2779
03:27:12.44 --> 03:27:18.52
that was kind of only right thing to do and try to get them out there and have that experience with us

2780
03:27:19.56 --> 03:27:28.12
man outstanding outstanding well you know again thank you so much thank you so much for joining us

2781
03:27:28.12 --> 03:27:33.16
thanks for sharing your story thanks for sharing your experiences thanks for sharing your lessons learned

2782
03:27:33.88 --> 03:27:40.76
unbelievable lessons learned and and thanks for what you've done for mankind to you know not only

2783
03:27:40.76 --> 03:27:46.20
in the medical field and then in the final frontier of space and then on top of that what you're

2784
03:27:46.20 --> 03:27:51.08
continuing to do right now with your foundations trying to get out there and get kids pointing

2785
03:27:51.08 --> 03:27:55.08
in the right direction you know we talked about what happens when kids get pointed in the wrong

2786
03:27:55.08 --> 03:28:00.60
direction we know how that turns out it's horrible and to see someone like you that we're able to

2787
03:28:00.60 --> 03:28:05.40
overcome those boundaries and overcome the ultimate boundaries and make it to where you've made it

2788
03:28:05.40 --> 03:28:10.20
just so much to learn and I just want to say thanks for coming on and thanks for sharing we appreciate it

03:28:16.12 --> 03:28:23.08
to get into my Twitter which is Astro underscore Jose so if you guys come and follow me and

2791
03:28:23.08 --> 03:28:27.80
you're on Instagram as well how you have that in stroke underscore Jose on Twitter at

2792
03:28:28.36 --> 03:28:37.80
Astro underscore Jose once again the foundation is Astro jh.org and then Tierra Luna and

2793
03:28:37.80 --> 03:28:44.92
Janerina Luna sellers that's where we can find you yep we can we can either launch satellites

2794
03:28:44.92 --> 03:28:49.32
or we can have a glass of wine you got us covered and if you drink enough wine it's probably both

2795

2799
03:29:15.88 --> 03:29:25.32
and with that Jose Hernandez has left the building man very cool but unbelievable story

2800
03:29:25.32 --> 03:29:31.56
everything full circle with that guy everything amazing man just incredible story obviously

2801
03:29:32.76 --> 03:29:38.52
he said a high bar on a long journey I was come out of these things being thinking myself well

2802
03:29:39.48 --> 03:29:44.04
I better raise the game I better raise the bar I better do a little bit better

2803
03:29:44.04 --> 03:29:50.28
I think that's what we I think that's what we all need to do okay doc what he got how can we

2804
03:29:50.28 --> 03:29:56.28
raise the game what do we need to do so we're we're raising the game on a strategic level and

2805
03:29:56.28 --> 03:30:03.48
a tactical level right all times strategic level technical right check this out so I'm going to

2806
03:30:03.48 --> 03:30:12.20
start tactical though and that's jacophil for me RTD go and a can need that hitter tactical solution

2807
03:30:12.20 --> 03:30:17.56
right but it doesn't stop there yeah it it serves the the greater goal to right the

2808
03:30:17.56 --> 03:30:23.32
most strategic goal which is staying on the path staying healthy not polluting my body with sugar

2809
03:30:23.32 --> 03:30:29.08
and freaking chemicals chemicals preserved as adatives right so we're doing both here with the

2810
03:30:29.08 --> 03:30:39.000
the jacophil or jacogo RTD cans check get that right right right right he's met all night thinking

2811
03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:45.000
that did you know bro speak I just cracked this go about 20 minutes ago and it came to me when

2812
03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:51.32
we were talking to Jose man yeah you know he was always he was always moving making little

2813
03:30:51.32 --> 03:30:58.12
tactical moves that were serving that greater vision and even you know even when it came to

2814
03:30:58.12 --> 03:31:04.12
when he was talking about retiring you know that strategic vision was still you know taking care

2815
03:31:04.12 --> 03:31:08.92
of the family he had achieved that that high as goal and now the the vision was to take care of

2816
03:31:08.92 --> 03:31:12.44
his family make sure they were good to go to the rock and roll now it's thinking strategic you

2817
03:31:12.44 --> 03:31:18.44
get all time and you're right and I started to talk about this with that idea of the of the deviation

2818
03:31:18.44 --> 03:31:23.96
right and the acceptance of deviation and how one minute like hey you know it's just one donut

2819
03:31:23.96 --> 03:31:29.08
and you just start to accept that you start to accept that you start to accept it don't accept it don't

2820
03:31:29.08 --> 03:31:34.76
accept it you got to stay on the freaking path you can't accept these deviations from the path you got

2821
03:31:34.76 --> 03:31:42.04
to get and if you deviate look if you deviate get back on it so that's where we're at yeah get you

2822
03:31:42.04 --> 03:31:45.48
get get something that's good for you you can drink something that's literally good for you

2823
03:31:46.20 --> 03:31:51.40
you don't have to drink something that's poison for your body which seems crazy that in this

2824
03:31:51.40 --> 03:31:56.92
day and age we have to tell people hey you don't have to poison yourself but people the the

2825
03:31:56.92 --> 03:32:03.64
companies that make this stuff have figured out oh we can get people addicted to sugar we got

2826
03:32:03.64 --> 03:32:08.92
them addicted to the rush that they're gonna get and that fake dopamine hit that they're

2827
03:32:08.92 --> 03:32:13.32
gonna get and it's all lies and it's literally bad for you you might as well just go

2828
03:32:14.04 --> 03:32:20.28
just just hit up the local freaking drug dealer and get some of that meth going that's where you're at

2829
03:32:20.28 --> 03:32:24.76

2830
03:32:24.76 --> 03:32:29.80

2831
03:32:29.80 --> 03:32:36.44
who are addicted addicted to energy drinks and and thus addicted to everything that comes

2832
03:32:36.44 --> 03:32:44.04
along with that energy drink and it is but it can lead to catastrophic failure right we don't want

2833

03:39:42.04 --> 03:39:48.60
where we we have been banned in certain scenarios you don't like that at all I probably got banned today

2902
03:39:48.60 --> 03:39:54.60
possibly because I told people to get off their phones get get off fight the algorithm fight the algorithm

2903
03:39:54.60 --> 03:39:59.64
how happy do you think that algorithm controllers are when they hear that I bet you that thing gets

2904
03:39:59.64 --> 03:40:04.60
beat down and freaking out the arms go on on a tige yeah they have like freaking alerts going off

2906
03:40:10.28 --> 03:40:15.16
can put down pack yeah they're fighting against the algorithm so look we don't know what's going

2907
03:40:15.16 --> 03:40:19.24
to happen we we push against the algorithm hard enough algorithms is going to push back they'll

2908
03:40:19.24 --> 03:40:24.04
push us right off but guess what we'll be okay we'll be standing by at jacco underground.com

2909
03:40:24.04 --> 03:40:30.60
where we have we have a little oasis set up it costs eight dollars and eighteen cents a month but

2911
03:40:38.44 --> 03:40:43.40

2912
03:40:43.40 --> 03:40:49.000
about q and a talk about some other subjects that are tangential to what we talk about on jacco

2913
03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:56.20
podcast but most important it just is a contingency in case something goes haywire and we have to

2914
03:40:56.20 --> 03:41:03.40
abandon the major platforms okay we'll be in jacco underground.com you can also find us on youtube

2915
03:41:04.36 --> 03:41:10.76
jacco podcast youtube channel subscribe there got some great videos up of the podcast where you can

2916
03:41:10.76 --> 03:41:20.68
see what jacco and echo and eye and or guess look like hey so no ragging so look when echo

2917
03:41:21.56 --> 03:41:26.60
can you explain that when I talk about being the a-ding and kind of coming through at the critical

2918
03:41:26.60 --> 03:41:31.88
moments and and so what heck was done the good to have come move he's made it seem like that's funny

2919
03:41:31.88 --> 03:41:36.68
ha ha he was he was like he went with that to make it seem like yeah jacco is just kidding because

2920
03:41:36.68 --> 03:41:44.28
he doesn't want he doesn't want to say the truth which is as you know at the critical junctures

2921
03:41:44.28 --> 03:41:50.44
at the critical junctures there's usually a little bit of like you know that that little connective

2922
03:41:50.44 --> 03:41:57.16
tissue right hey look echo brings he brings the major bulk of the of the muscle mass to the scenario

2923
03:41:57.16 --> 03:42:04.68
but that achilles tendon you got it got to get right so the assistant director myself let's face

2924
03:42:04.68 --> 03:42:11.08
sometimes I got to come in with a big win you've seen it I've seen it but I will also say

2925
03:42:11.08 --> 03:42:18.28
I will also say the echo Charles is open-minded in these scenarios he's right up luckily he's humble enough

2926
03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:25.32
and he knows he doesn't push back when that when we're in fact when the assistant director comes in

2927
03:42:25.32 --> 03:42:37.16
it makes a suggestion echo Charles is humble enough to say yeah jacco's right again open-minded open-minded

2928
03:42:37.16 --> 03:42:43.80
for sure but we so we've got those videos up on our YouTube channel origin also has an amazing
