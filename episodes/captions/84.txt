[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 84 with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
[00:00:08] Good evening echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:14] Gentlemen, your life expectancy from the day you join your battalion will be precisely
[00:00:21] three weeks.
[00:00:24] The Florida mustache major who addressed us at the small reinforcement camp a few miles
[00:00:31] from Bayou obviously had misplaced how to misplace sense of humor.
[00:00:36] Or he should have been sacked.
[00:00:39] On second thought, he definitely should have been sacked.
[00:00:42] Not that any of the dozen infantry subalterns took the slightest notice of what to us with
[00:00:49] the ramblings of an old fool. He was probably no more than 40.
[00:00:56] The fourth battalion, the summer set light infantry was in one twenty nine brigade and
[00:01:03] was a pre-war territorial army battalion with close links with Bristol and Bath.
[00:01:11] In the United Kingdom till late June 1944 it was a close knit unit which had almost been
[00:01:21] decimated within a period of 48 hours.
[00:01:26] On fifth of July, three officers and 62 other ranks were required as reinforcements.
[00:01:34] Between the 14th and the 18th of July, a further 12 officers of whom I was one and
[00:01:41] 479 other ranks arrived and even then the battalion was still below its full strength of 36
[00:01:50] officers and nearly 700 NCOs and men.
[00:01:55] This will give some idea of the appalling level of infantry casualties which had to be
[00:02:01] accepted in order to enlarge the slender and vulnerable Normandy beachhead.
[00:02:09] As I had the had had previous experience of six pounder anti tank guns, the commanding
[00:02:16] officer, Lippi, Lieutenant Colonel C. G. Lipscomb, posted me as second in command to the
[00:02:22] battalion's anti tank platoon which consisted of six guns.
[00:02:28] But my stay with that platoon was short and I was quickly sucked into the real infantry
[00:02:33] battle as commander of 18 platoon in D company on the 31st of July immediately after the
[00:02:40] battle of Briskersarred D company had just lost their commander Tim Brathweigh, lost a
[00:02:48] foot and gained a military cross and 18 platoon their commander.
[00:02:58] So that right there is the beginning of a book that we're going to look at today.
[00:03:05] It's called 18 platoon.
[00:03:07] It's written by a guy named Sydney Jerry, J.A.R. Y. who was born in Essex in 1924.
[00:03:17] When the army in 1942 was a private soldier in 1943 he was commissioned and from 19 from July
[00:03:27] of 1944 until June of 1945 he served as the platoon commander for 18 platoon.
[00:03:35] And the chances of survival for an infantry subaltern in a rifle company during the
[00:03:45] campaign in northwest Europe or slim most survived for only a few weeks.
[00:03:51] Sydney Jerry survived 10 months from July 1944 when he took command of 18 platoon in
[00:03:59] Normandy until the end of the war near Bremen in early May of 1945.
[00:04:06] So this guy this is this is amazing this guy, Sydney Jerry he's the only platoon commander
[00:04:15] in the British second army to survive as a platoon commander from Normandy to the German
[00:04:22] surrender one guy, one guy, and this is the guy.
[00:04:30] It's amazing and you're going to see that his attitude is I mean the lessons that he learned
[00:04:39] he was young coming in he was 20 years old 20-year old platoon commander coming in in
[00:04:44] the experience kind of lived a sheltered life you got to check out some pictures of him
[00:04:48] he has that look to he looks like you know sheltered looks like a little young whipper
[00:04:53] snapper.
[00:04:56] So we'll go back to the book here as he breaks down what a platoon was at this time.
[00:05:01] In 1944 the war establishment of a British infantry platoon was 36 men.
[00:05:06] It consisted of three rifle sections each of 10 men including a bread gunner each
[00:05:11] commanded by a corpel or sometimes a land sergeant there was also a small platoon head
[00:05:16] quarters with a two inch mortar detachment a p-out which was of anti tank weapon.
[00:05:25] The platoon sergeant and the commanders Batman slash runner on July 31st 18 platoon consisted
[00:05:36] of 17 all ranks 12 of whom were recent reinforcements.
[00:05:42] He'll one 12 and brick cigar had claimed the rest.
[00:05:48] So think about that you're supposed to have 36 people in your platoon and they have 17
[00:05:56] of which 12 are replacements which means that 29 people had been casualties.
[00:06:04] There's seven people that had been either killed or wounded.
[00:06:08] There's sorry seven people out of this 36 that hadn't been killed or wounded that remained
[00:06:11] in the platoon right now.
[00:06:13] So that's what we're talking about here.
[00:06:16] And again he's coming in no combat experience.
[00:06:19] He rolls in and we're going back to the book.
[00:06:21] I sensed instantly that a tight grip was required particularly so because those few who survived
[00:06:29] till one 12 had witnessed what was without a doubt the most horrific tragedy that befell
[00:06:35] the battalion during the entire campaign.
[00:06:42] So he's about to explain what they had been through.
[00:06:44] He wasn't there for it but he knew and he had heard what they had been through.
[00:06:47] And I'm going to say that again this is the most horrific tragedy for the entire campaign.
[00:06:52] This is what they're coming off of and this is who he's going to take over for.
[00:06:55] This is what they had been through.
[00:06:57] Back to the book during a company night attack one of our soldiers had been hit in the lower
[00:07:02] chest by a rifle or machine gun bullet.
[00:07:06] Passing through his body it had not killed him outright.
[00:07:10] The bullets devilish course lay through the soldiers webbing equipment pouch which contained
[00:07:16] a 77 phosphorus smoke grenade which exploded.
[00:07:23] But on barbed wire the poor soldier laid disemboweled for all around to see his writhing body
[00:07:31] a smoking mass of burning phosphorus.
[00:07:37] Responding to his agonized screams to put him out of his misery his platoon commander shot
[00:07:43] him through the heart.
[00:07:46] And finally through the head after the poor man's final frenzyed pleas.
[00:07:53] Their sir through the head.
[00:08:00] Doug Proctor was witness to this sublimely courageous incident which seared itself upon all
[00:08:07] our hearts.
[00:08:13] So that's what you're going to take over for.
[00:08:15] Can you do that?
[00:08:17] I mean is that like legal you know like if they found out that that happened.
[00:08:22] I have no idea what the legal ramifications are.
[00:08:26] But the moral weight on the shoulders of the men that witness that is unbelievably.
[00:08:36] It's hard to imagine what that feels like.
[00:08:43] Back to the book to the NCOs.
[00:08:45] Sergeant Jim Kingston and Corporal Doug Proctor immediately reported to me and explained
[00:08:51] that forcefully and in great detail the poor stayed the platoon as they knew it to be.
[00:08:56] So you've got these guys these are the senior enlisted guys in the platoon Jim Kingston
[00:09:00] and Doug Proctor and you're going to hear a lot about them.
[00:09:03] And they're coming to him.
[00:09:04] Here's this new guy checking in and they're coming to him and they're you know telling
[00:09:07] him how what what a bad state the platoon is in.
[00:09:12] Back to the book while they did so I was conscious of being weighed up was I fit to be
[00:09:16] their platoon commander.
[00:09:18] They were responsible anxious and discriminating NCOs that stands for non-commissioned officer.
[00:09:24] It's the senior enlisted guys and my apprenticeship was to start immediately.
[00:09:31] They were startled by my attire previously warned by a young officer who'd fought in
[00:09:35] Tunisia that battle dress was most unsuitable for brat battle.
[00:09:41] I'd come prepared and sand colored corduroy trousers and a stout pullover not unlike that
[00:09:46] now warned throughout the army.
[00:09:49] Among my prejudices was an acute dislike of steel helmets they gave me headaches.
[00:09:54] On exercises in England I had been obliged to wear one but the surge of individualism
[00:10:00] which now engulfed me convinced me that this was an article of equipment best left out
[00:10:04] of battle.
[00:10:06] So he's he shows up and he's kind of dressed out of uniform.
[00:10:10] Doesn't want to wear his helmet wearing corduroy pants.
[00:10:14] Back to the book Battle School's in England had insisted that off infantry officers should
[00:10:18] wear the same equipment and dress as their soldiers the idea being that they could not
[00:10:22] be then be so easily identified by enemy snipers.
[00:10:27] They also decreed that one should carry a rifle or a stand gun.
[00:10:32] Clearly this was ridiculous.
[00:10:34] How on earth could your own soldiers recognize you in the heat of battle if you went through
[00:10:38] such lengths to disguise?
[00:10:40] He had the same attitude as Lieutenant Lee in Korea that was wearing the orange vest you
[00:10:46] remember that?
[00:10:48] So he could be identified in battle by his own men.
[00:10:52] That's what this guy's attitude is like I'm not going to dress like everyone else
[00:10:54] they need to beat they need to know who that I'm out there.
[00:10:57] They need to be able to see me.
[00:10:59] Back to the book.
[00:11:00] I dispense with the rifle or stand gun too because I'm hopelessly short sighted and I did
[00:11:05] not fancy trying to command a platoon while got up like a Christmas tree meaning covered
[00:11:10] in a bunch of gear.
[00:11:12] As a concession to impending battle I sported a 45-colt automatic pistol with two spare
[00:11:17] magazines.
[00:11:20] The 38-n field revolver then general issue throughout the army managed to combine total
[00:11:24] mechanical liability with complete ineffectiveness.
[00:11:26] I once fired chick shots from one at a target pinned to a plywood board none of which even
[00:11:34] penetrated the board.
[00:11:37] Neither did I hit the target which gave me little confidence in this weapon.
[00:11:40] The nine pounds I paid for the cult proved a sound investment.
[00:11:44] So there's a lot of people that like to talk about what type of side arm there you've got
[00:11:50] a big proponent for the cult 45 the old classic.
[00:11:56] Again important to remember that he's not even carrying a rifle because he knows his job
[00:12:00] of sleep and I used to do it when we had seals seal leaders that would spend too much
[00:12:06] time on their gun.
[00:12:07] I would say hey you know what they used to carry in the Marine Corps in the army.
[00:12:11] If you were leader you know what they'd carry the carry a pistol.
[00:12:14] So give me your rifle and we take it from them.
[00:12:16] You need to be leading not shooting.
[00:12:20] Lave talks about that a lot.
[00:12:22] Yeah it's very you know Lave talks about his mentality which was he wants to shoot.
[00:12:27] He's from Texas.
[00:12:29] You know he wants to shoot his gun and he realized hey I'm not here to shoot my gun.
[00:12:33] I'm here to you know be at high port and be off my gun and leading.
[00:12:38] That's my job and these guys took it to the point where they're not even carrying a rifle.
[00:12:44] Now he's talking about a senior leadership a little bit his enlisted leadership.
[00:12:47] Back to the book Jim Kingston was short, quiet and shy with the shootness of a countryman
[00:12:53] although he had lived and worked in Bristol all his life.
[00:12:57] He barely raised his voice but had total command over his section.
[00:13:02] There was no argument with Jim that that's another thing you'd find about this book.
[00:13:07] This book it it it takes so many stereotypes from from from Sydney Jerry on down like
[00:13:14] the stereotypes are just out the window of the way this between was and there's a classic
[00:13:18] example you know you picture the senior listed guy this you know gunny highway scenario
[00:13:23] not happening.
[00:13:26] Now he talks about Doug Proctor back to the book Doug Proctor although a summer set came from
[00:13:31] notting him.
[00:13:33] Also short he was positive direct with unfailing common sense and like Jim quietly
[00:13:39] dominated his section.
[00:13:42] So there's another and I got to see some great leaders.
[00:13:46] There's some guys that were in where in to you bruiser that were quiet when they were
[00:13:50] in to you bruiser and when I was putting them through their next workup I was thinking
[00:13:55] myself hey are they going to be able to step up and lead and that's exactly how they did
[00:13:58] it right there they were just like quiet professional and controlling but they run their
[00:14:04] mouth to get it done.
[00:14:08] Back to the book I had not previously met any platoon like this one they were quiet
[00:14:14] thoughtful and unabraceive soldiers there was little swearing and there existed a tranquility
[00:14:20] in their relationships with one another.
[00:14:24] Their eyes implored me not to fail them.
[00:14:28] Two factors were immediately apparent firstly the platoon required quiet firm and confident
[00:14:35] leadership.
[00:14:37] So that's a good assessment you know you can see these guys don't need anybody yelling
[00:14:42] at him and here's the second point secondly if I failed to use my imagination and
[00:14:48] slavishly followed the battle school drills most of the platoon would not survive another
[00:14:54] major battle.
[00:14:56] So all the things he learned the standard typical stuff that he learned that wasn't
[00:15:01] an work and it hadn't worked that's why they had so many replacements come in.
[00:15:06] Back to the book in fact the problem that faced me with 18 platoon was identical to the
[00:15:11] one facing general Montgomery army group commander how to fight and defeat the cream of the
[00:15:16] SS Panzer divisions in the closed Normandy Bokaj and still retained sufficient infantry riflemen
[00:15:24] to live in fight tomorrow.
[00:15:27] The problem was a difficult one obviously I must set an example and always lead from the front
[00:15:33] however if I became over eager and got myself killed or wounded the whole object of my previous
[00:15:40] training and my responsibility to my platoon would be cast away.
[00:15:44] I would in fact be letting down a team platoon so he knows he's got to lead from the front
[00:15:49] same time he knows he's got to stay alive.
[00:15:52] He knows he got to stay alive and this Normandy fighting here he talks about Normandy being
[00:15:58] a defender's paradise meaning when you're on the defense and Normandy it's it's a paradise
[00:16:04] for the people on defense which was the Germans back to the book we fought from one head
[00:16:09] road to the next up torturous overgrown sunken lanes ideal country for the German defender
[00:16:15] but a palling for attacking infantry however no arm but infantry could take and hold the Normandy
[00:16:22] Bokaj Bokaj is like a trees shrubs mankled together.
[00:16:31] It was here that I served my apprenticeship and the platoon developed its character which despite
[00:16:36] constant depletion by casualties over the coming ten months it would retain until the end of the war.
[00:16:42] It was also here that in perceptibly I became possessive with a tain platoon it was mine
[00:16:49] to be guarded with an almost maternal jealousy that resented all criticism of my soldiers.
[00:16:57] That's building at this point.
[00:17:00] Hmm, most important it was in the Bokaj that I began to appreciate how vital is grip
[00:17:11] grip on oneself grip on one soldiers and grip on the situation.
[00:17:20] Unlike characters in novels and films most men react nervously to real battle conditions
[00:17:25] discipline and regimental pride are supports but in decisive moments of great danger the grip of the
[00:17:35] leader on the lead is paramount. Infantry section in platoon commanders must possess the minds and
[00:17:44] hearts of their soldiers. Strength of character is not enough successful leadership in battle
[00:17:50] although complex and intangible always seem to me to depend on two factors.
[00:17:58] Firstly soldiers must have confidence in their leaders professional ability and secondly they must
[00:18:05] trust them as men. So there you go they gotta have confidence in your ability and trust.
[00:18:14] And this trust topic comes up all the time and I use the the word relationships
[00:18:19] kind of interchangeably with trust. I always have to remind myself to point that out that when I'm
[00:18:24] talking about relationships and building relationships and business on the battlefield in life
[00:18:30] relationships are a trust that's what they are. We build your relationship on trust and I guess you could have
[00:18:36] you know relationships that aren't built on trust that there was like another thing you know
[00:18:40] I have a relationship with that guy but you know but that's not the one that's what I'm talking about
[00:18:44] about. I'm a good relationship. Yeah. Those are based on trust and those are obviously
[00:18:50] the the second most important thing to him. So first is confidence in their ability and second is trust.
[00:18:58] I like this part. It helps too if a leader has the reputation of being lucky.
[00:19:04] Field Marshal Montgomery placed great importance on the principle of making the enemy dance to your tune.
[00:19:10] No where is this more important than in Poutooning Company Battle? It is decisive because if you do not
[00:19:17] dominate events your enemy will. There you go. That's your jits. You're right there. Be
[00:19:24] first. Be first. Be first. Yeah. You gotta be first. You gotta dictate the pace. You gotta you gotta be proactive.
[00:19:30] Hmm. Back to the book Sound Leadership like True Love to which I suspect it is closely related
[00:19:40] is all powerful. It can overcome the seemingly impossible and it's effect on both leader and
[00:19:49] lead is profound and lasting. Even after the passage of 40 years, brief mention of the battalions
[00:19:56] finest officers and NCOs bring brings a smile to the faces of the survivors of my Poutoon.
[00:20:03] Their resentment of those who failed to lead when it mattered most still runs astonishingly deep.
[00:20:12] So leadership can overcome seemingly impossible. This is why leadership is the most important
[00:20:19] thing on the battlefield. Now he's going into his. So that's kind of his assessment and this is
[00:20:28] based on his experience which we're about to get into. Then he does more assessments. There's more
[00:20:33] more he talks more about what he learns about leadership as a whole. But you have to kind of
[00:20:37] understand what he went through and figure out where he learned it from. The first, his first command
[00:20:43] in battle here we go back to the book. We were to attack this rugged hill from the west with the
[00:20:50] fifth wheelchairs on our right and the fourth wheelchairs in reserves. The approach march to our
[00:20:56] forming up place had been a nightmare of swirling a brace of dust, shelling and the stench
[00:21:01] of exhaust fumes from the tanks which transported us forward. We were due to attack at 1500 hours
[00:21:09] with a company leading on the right and B company on the left. We followed B company. B company
[00:21:16] moved off quickly with our company deployed about 300 yards behind. Their forward platoon
[00:21:22] had barely crossed the stream when concentrated spend outfire came from the front and from both
[00:21:28] flanks. So spend outfire. This is kind of a generic term that the brits used for German machine guns.
[00:21:35] They're primarily talking about the MG 42 which is a big belt-fed machine gun. Very similar to
[00:21:42] a modern what we have M60 or Mark 48 machine gun. A big heavy belt-fed machine gun
[00:21:49] which lays down the insane amounts of suppressive fire. So here we go. They're getting hit from
[00:21:56] both flanks with these machine guns back to the book. There must have been about 12 machine guns
[00:22:01] firing at one time. This devastating display of firepower stopped the battalion dead in its tracks.
[00:22:09] There was no way forward or around it and no way to retire. Some of the guns had engaged D company
[00:22:16] over the heads of B company and private Morrison 18 platoon was killed. So there's his first guy,
[00:22:23] lost. I like this the way he starts off this next sentence here. First word,
[00:22:31] powerless. So he's in his first combat situation. He's got one man killed and how does he feel
[00:22:37] powerless. Here we go. Powerless and crouching in a headrow. I tried to identify the Spanned
[00:22:42] Alphazicians. This proved impossible as they still kept up their crushing display of firepower.
[00:22:49] In my ignorance I expected that the enemy machine gunners would soon expand their ammunition.
[00:22:53] They did not. Nor did they in dozens of subsequent battles. So he's waiting for them to stop shooting.
[00:23:03] They don't. They just keep coming. Captain Scamel commanding A company was severely wounded.
[00:23:10] Major Thomas commanding B company was killed. Their companies were badly cut up on our right
[00:23:15] the fifth wheelchairs had faired no better with their CO killed and casualties mounting.
[00:23:21] Their attack also foundered. As the afternoon turned to evening,
[00:23:27] shelling and mortoring increased much of it passing over our heads. Thus isolating us from the
[00:23:32] reserve battalion. So the Germans are mortoring over their heads so that the reserve battalion can't
[00:23:38] get to them. Shortly before dark, a troop of tanks arrived. One of which was able to cross the
[00:23:45] stream and give us some brave, close support. Undoubtedly it increased our morale but it was not enough
[00:23:51] to get the whole attack underway again. Any movement by B company to our front brought down instant
[00:23:58] and concentrated Spanned Alphazer. The same applied to us a few hundred yards to their rear.
[00:24:07] Fortunately the enemy did not seem to have any anti-tank guns so our armored friends
[00:24:12] were comparatively safe. But the fact remained that about 12 Spanned O's had halted a battalion
[00:24:19] attack without our locating even one of them. That's what suppressive fire does. That's what a
[00:24:26] big machine gun does. You got 12 big machine guns that's stopping 700 people from moving.
[00:24:33] That's called suppressive fire. That's why you don't when you heard Roger Hayden talk about
[00:24:38] how many heavy weapons that how many machine guns they'd carry. They think they had nine
[00:24:43] out of opportunity to 14. That's why. As Dusk fell a new plan was made. C and D companies would
[00:24:52] advance and single file through A and B companies and using the cover of darkness infiltrate
[00:24:57] the enemy position. Once through them we would climb to the top of the hill and consolidate.
[00:25:02] A cold and damp mist descended which with fading light gave us welcome cover but also
[00:25:07] wretched discomfort. We were still in shirt sleeves which became damp from the sweat of our
[00:25:12] exertion climbing the steep lower slopes. A lurk with pistol in hand I anticipated a sudden brush
[00:25:19] with an enemy post. Not a shot was fired. By some miracle we passed right through their positions
[00:25:26] without being detected or luck had changed. So you're going to see quite a bit of that is as they
[00:25:36] were what the Germans were doing at this point defending hard but then instead of staying and dying
[00:25:40] in most cases they would retreat. And so they'd fight really hard for a while and then retreat.
[00:25:46] They'd advance if they had an opportunity but you're going to see a lot of that.
[00:25:50] Back to the book we now had to advance across a large orchard. So I deployed the
[00:25:54] cartoon with two sections up and urged them forward as fast as possible. Suddenly in the middle of
[00:25:59] the orchard we came across a young girl in a clean white dress sitting with her back to an
[00:26:04] apple tree sketching. Now I just talked about this the most of the random things that happen
[00:26:11] in combat and this is what I'm talking about and how do you train for that? How would you ever
[00:26:16] if you're running a battle problem to train people what are you going to do put a white girl
[00:26:20] in a white dress and then sitting with her back to a tree sketching? Doesn't make any sense?
[00:26:24] How do you deal with it? Back to the book she seemed quite oblivious to the mortar fire in 18
[00:26:28] boutunes warlike appearance. How to stop pretty young girls from interfering with battle
[00:26:33] had not been part of my training as an officer cadet nor had it appeared on the curriculum of
[00:26:38] any battle schools which without exception had dispared of my future as an infantry soldier.
[00:26:46] Fortunately there was a farmhouse beside the orchard and it had a seller where she was persuaded
[00:26:51] to shelter while we got on with our battle. I reported what it occurred to our company commander
[00:26:57] who told me that I was being quite ridiculous really Jerry you're being absurd.
[00:27:01] With that remark I realized that he had been a schoolmaster, a breed with whom I had been in conflict
[00:27:10] until quite recently. A breed with whom I'd been in conflict with until quite recently. So this guy
[00:27:16] has the attitude of a schoolmaster which in England is a little bit different and especially in the
[00:27:23] 1930s and 40s you know the strict I think of a pink Floyd you know the headmaster
[00:27:28] how can you have it you putting if you don't eat you meet that guy that's what he's comparing them to.
[00:27:34] His next sarcastic remark I would be obliged Jerry if you would kindly get on with the war.
[00:27:40] He gave me little indication of what he wanted my opportunity to do,
[00:27:43] nor did it inspire confidence. We were still over 200 yards from the meadow surrounded by corn fields
[00:27:49] which was the company's objective and now became apparent that our company commander had an
[00:27:54] academic and detached attitude of mind which made it quite impossible for him to come in the company.
[00:28:01] So the company the company commander's not in the game. There's one thing to be detached from your
[00:28:06] emotions to make sure you're not getting caught up in the mayhem was another thing to be so detached
[00:28:10] that you're not even aware of what's going on and actually I had a name for this when I was running
[00:28:16] training. Battlefield aloofness is what I call them because we'd get these guys you get these
[00:28:22] guys and we'd be running these crazy battlefield problems on them and there'd be not to be crazy
[00:28:27] and you'd go remember one time there's the the task unit commander there's all this mayhem going on.
[00:28:32] The Patoons are getting overrun and people are getting me you know shot with paintball and they're
[00:28:36] not hitting their objectives and I walk over to the company commander he's sitting in a home v
[00:28:40] I'm sorry the the to you commander the troop commander he's sitting in a home v
[00:28:45] and I like the windows up because they're both windows but he doesn't want to get shot with paintball
[00:28:49] the windows up he's just sitting in there he's got his head set on of his radio like knock on the door
[00:28:54] I'm like hey man you know what what's going on out there he's like well I'm I'm trying to gather that
[00:29:01] information right now and I'm like bro you eager to gather anything here but dust yeah you need to
[00:29:08] get out there and make something happen because his idea was you know I need to be detached
[00:29:12] which I talk about being detached all the time but there's a difference between being and as you
[00:29:17] see the same thing in businesses where the the the boss or the leader has no idea what's
[00:29:22] happening on the ground floor right he has no what the the workers are doing so he's so far to
[00:29:27] attach that he's he's you know let them eat cake right that's where that's where this guy is
[00:29:32] wait so why is that that's because what they they just in a way just depend on them to just handle it
[00:29:38] on their own they think they're gonna handle it on their own which is a good attitude to have until
[00:29:42] they can't handle it anymore right once they can't once a once a team or a platoon or a business
[00:29:48] you can't handle it on their own and they're failing you have to get you have to go do your
[00:29:54] job you have to step up you have to step down as leader you have to get in there and square that
[00:29:58] stuff away yeah so it's that without the get in their part right it's just like all right just
[00:30:05] call me when it's done yeah and and and the problem is somebody's got to sort these problems out
[00:30:10] yeah yeah they're there they're real and and they're not getting better and you might take you a
[00:30:15] minute's go okay wait a second this these problems aren't getting better what should I do
[00:30:19] once you realize that they're not getting better you got to get in there make it happen yeah
[00:30:24] this guy's not doing that back to the book he'd be behaved like a superseelious
[00:30:29] umpire on an exercise in England at any moment I expected him to had managed me for bad tactics
[00:30:35] and the schoolboy in me feared that I might be sent to the headmaster for beating so they continue on
[00:30:43] we seized the highest point which faced the enemy and the other platoons quickly deployed
[00:30:47] to give all around defense of the other flanks after being murdered the company required no
[00:30:53] encouragement to dig in the real motivator getting mortar will make you shovel hard yeah the company
[00:31:01] commander walked round the platoon positions I ain't everyone with distaste nothing pleased him
[00:31:10] and he suddenly announced that he must sleep which he did in my slit trench getting not a good
[00:31:15] feeling about this company commander just looking at everyone like negatively and then all of a
[00:31:21] sudden he wants to sleep I don't like this guy and of course he sleeps in in my trench
[00:31:27] mm now this is good there's another officer that's there that's present a guardian angel was
[00:31:34] watching over us in the guise of Dennis Clark Dennis some years older than me was exceptionally
[00:31:41] kind to me and tolerant of my immaturity pay attention this is good he took my took me by the arm a
[00:31:49] few paces away from my platoon who the hell is in command of this shambles sunny I muttered the
[00:31:57] unconvincing explanation that it was our company commander looking me straight in the eye he drew a
[00:32:03] deep breath which managed to express both exasperation at my explanation and sympathy with my
[00:32:09] predicament you and I know that he is not so what are you going to do about it I asked him if I
[00:32:19] should take command his expression hardened yes you bloody well should some demonstration of loyalty
[00:32:28] to my wretched company commander was obviously required I blurred it out that he was really a school master
[00:32:33] and not a professional soldier so he's kind of defending him Dennis put his arm around my shoulder
[00:32:39] and whispered in my ear so was eyes sunny so that's awesome the company commander is not leading
[00:32:52] and this this guy Dennis Clark quit think he's artillery gunner pulls this guy's head aside and
[00:33:00] just throw you better take charge of this and you better do it quick back to the book we were now
[00:33:05] well dug in on our objective the company commander was still asleep Dennis was arranging defensive
[00:33:11] fire tasks for me I had assumed command of D company without a word passing between our company
[00:33:19] commander and me in practice it made not the slightest difference because because like a bad
[00:33:26] preparatory school master he saw his role as one of examination and criticism this he continued to
[00:33:34] do despite the incredulous stairs of the ncos so he's taken charge and and he hasn't even said anything
[00:33:40] he's just done it he just took charge and all the guys the guys continue to walk around did
[00:33:45] stare glare at everyone but that doesn't matter so this is a classic example your leader's not
[00:33:52] leading I've given this answer to so many times but this is a classic this might be one of the best
[00:33:57] examples your leaders not leading that's fine good step up and lead yourself hmm back to the book
[00:34:05] by dawn the enemy had retired an elements of the Italian move forward to consolidate and strength
[00:34:09] and decoupling his position the whole operation was very amateur there was no doubt that the new
[00:34:15] company commander could not command a company in battle nor could I who is just beginning to master
[00:34:22] the rudiments of commanding a platoon he was removed within a few hours I think Dennis had something to
[00:34:28] do with it but he was not the kind of man to confide in 20 year old sub-alterns so that's another
[00:34:34] classic thing right there is that this guy Dennis who is another officer probably went and said
[00:34:41] to get this guy out of here get this company commander out of here but when he does it the company
[00:34:45] commander gets removed and and he doesn't say anything to Sydney Jerry he doesn't you to
[00:34:51] rattle it out or brag about her make a big deal he doesn't say anything just happens it's like
[00:34:56] when I had a mutiny and my platoon and the commanding officer's like no we're not firing anyone you
[00:35:01] guys get out of here shut your mouth and go back to work no we're like okay and then a few days
[00:35:06] a little like a week later he got fired but he wasn't because of us as far as we knew right no one
[00:35:11] said anything we just knew he got fired yeah well what reason hmm we knew we had something to do with it
[00:35:17] but same thing so you don't need to create a distrust and disloyalty and and not even just those
[00:35:25] words but you don't need to create drama yeah right don't create the drama yeah that guy's
[00:35:30] going to go in somewhere he's getting building someone else hey you guys want everybody yeah yeah we're
[00:35:34] not doing that we're not doing that we're not building up our own ego by disparaging someone else's
[00:35:40] let's worry about the whole team that sounds like a good idea to me yeah back to the book I now have
[00:35:47] little doubt that for the first two months in Normandy we lack two things comprehensive and imaginative
[00:35:52] training and personal experience of battle we were also seriously handicapped by our casual
[00:35:58] attitude too many junior officers did not think for themselves and persistently relied on the
[00:36:05] narrow teaching of battle schools who's dogma had assumed the proportion of holy rit so whatever
[00:36:11] he was taught he was taught that that's the only way you can ever do it and these guys and if
[00:36:16] talk about this many times on the on the podcast the goal when I was running training was to actually
[00:36:22] get the people to think it wasn't get sure you have to establish the baseline standard operating
[00:36:27] procedures that's great and those need to be rock solid but once those things are established you
[00:36:33] need to make people understand that you don't always follow them and you need to call off a piece
[00:36:39] of that standard operating procedure to insert some other thing and bring in another standard
[00:36:43] operating procedure and mix and match them so you get something that's effective you need to
[00:36:46] think that's what a leader needs to do a leader needs to think back to the book the British
[00:36:51] infantry platoons and companies were overtrained and board stiff with basic infantry tactics
[00:36:56] which as far as they went were good much of this training unfortunately had been in the hands
[00:37:00] of battle school instructors who themselves lacked battle experience and imagination
[00:37:08] these tended to become pedagogues disciples of DS directing staff solution
[00:37:15] about which no argument could be tolerated so DS is that he be he mentions in a bunch
[00:37:20] like that's their solution the directing staff you can't argue with them they're the they're the
[00:37:24] cadre possibly like most of our entry infantry they suffered some consequences of the pre-roar
[00:37:33] shortage of creativity intelligent regimental officers two few of them were professionally
[00:37:39] dedicated to the extent that they could visualize how battles would be fought and identify the
[00:37:44] problems that might arise when planning them they seemed to lack the capacity to think relentlessly
[00:37:50] through these things until solutions were found much of their time had been spent policing the British
[00:37:56] empire also unlike the Germans we British instinctively avoid displays of keenness
[00:38:04] the enthusiast particularly if he is innovative isn't embarrassment
[00:38:08] thus the battlefield became our teacher and inevitably it exacted a grim price in blood and time
[00:38:20] so as you're training you got to push yourself hard you've got to put yourself in situations
[00:38:28] I don't care what you're training for I don't care if you're training for combat in a
[00:38:31] sea of platoon in an army infantry platoon or if you're in the business world and you're training your leaders to handle
[00:38:38] situations or you're training your customer service reps to handle situations what no matter which one of
[00:38:44] those you're in you need to push people hard you need to put them in worst case scenario so that they
[00:38:48] need to learn how they need to learn how to think to get out of those problems
[00:38:52] hmm I recall within bearishment an incident at 45th Infantry Division battle school during the
[00:39:02] spring of 1944 an exceptionally tall and good-natured Canadian officer had been sent to the school to
[00:39:08] give a talk on the street fighting he had experienced nearly it was an interesting talk but some of
[00:39:14] his advice ran contrary to that being taught in the school when the lecture was over the chief and
[00:39:21] instructor with insulting condensation thank this shy and kindly man for a vivid word picture
[00:39:28] and turning to the students warned us that as this officer's experience was probably unusual
[00:39:36] we had best not stray from the DS solution as taught at that school so you got to combat veteran
[00:39:45] come and back with experience from street fighting in Italy and he'd come back with some different tactics
[00:39:53] and they tell him you don't listen that guy that's just a rare case close mind will get you killed
[00:40:04] this is starting to talk about they're overall sort of formulation of combat plans and how they
[00:40:12] operated back to the book the most successful actions by 18 Paltoon were fought without the support of
[00:40:18] artillery or armor we had learned in a hard school how to skirmish infiltrate and edge our way forward
[00:40:27] the right or left flanking platoon attack so beloved of the battle school staff would rarely succeed in
[00:40:33] the Normandy Bocage I remember with harbing locked into timetables of meticulously planned
[00:40:41] large battles these invariably left the junior infantry commander no scope for exploitation
[00:40:47] if you found a gap in the enemy defenses adherence to artillery program which rarely could be altered
[00:40:53] effectively stopped any personal initiative so what that saying is you have these the artillery
[00:40:59] that's gonna drop bombs they're gonna bomb or strike with artillery at certain regions in certain
[00:41:04] times so you might see the enemy running away and you have a chance to gain a superior tactical position
[00:41:10] but you can't because you know that that's where the bombs are going to be hitting in the next 12
[00:41:14] minutes so you can't go so now you sit and wait so he got locked in by that back to the book to me
[00:41:21] the preparations for these battles assumed the demented proportion of a cough got like
[00:41:25] nightmare ballet in which the anonymous they ordained that we must perform a choreographed ritual
[00:41:33] dance macabre I felt trapped and helpless no solo parts were written into the score nor was
[00:41:42] their scope for small groups of performers in this mammoth ballet of machines undoubtedly far shadows
[00:41:50] from the song that the battle song clouded my emotions but instinct told me that this kind of show
[00:41:56] would be unlikely to succeed the irony was that this support was planned and given to the infantry
[00:42:02] with the best of intentions the song had cast its shadows on our artillery and armored commanders
[00:42:09] both genuinely believed that their hands that in their hands they had the pancia which would protect
[00:42:17] us the infantry from the terrible slaughter of 1916 instead they put us in a straight jacket so
[00:42:25] very interesting viewpoint and and it's something that we need to pay attention to because you've got
[00:42:33] to be flexible you've got to be flexible and that's exactly what he's talking about and these they
[00:42:38] would make these plans that were so comprehensive and there was no you weren't allowed to deviate
[00:42:42] from the plants and you're not allowed to deviate from the plans and something starts going
[00:42:46] differently than what you expected you're trapped yeah to a phone back to the book far too much time
[00:42:55] had been spent fitting the infantry and armor junior leaders into the big picture and to little
[00:43:02] time spent training them and stimulating their imagination initiative an individual resourcefulness
[00:43:10] to probe draw conclusions infiltrate and exploit weakness in the enemy's dispositions so he's
[00:43:17] he's criticizing this lack of initiative lack of creativity and the training to get that initiative
[00:43:22] in creativity back to the book after the first of August 18 puttune never failed in any attack
[00:43:31] sometimes we took a little longer than planned but we always got there in the end
[00:43:34] in defense we never lost one yard of ground nor did the enemy ever penetrate arpotune position
[00:43:43] and we always dominated no man's land with our patrols whether persistent patrolling is always
[00:43:49] sound policy I will argue elsewhere so he's saying once he kind of figured it out they didn't
[00:43:57] lose anymore they didn't lose any attacks and they didn't give up any ground talks about the
[00:44:01] armor our armor was accused of being tiger shy meaning scared of the tiger tanks of the Germans
[00:44:07] and I don't wonder why the devastation caused by a single hit of an 88 millimeter armor piercing
[00:44:15] shell needed to be seen to be believed and this is an overall statement for the infantry and
[00:44:23] armor the British second army the sheer ferocity of the fighting in Normandy came as a
[00:44:28] salature solitary shock for which they were in some ways unprepared so it was devastating for
[00:44:37] these guys now we start pushing out out of out of Normandy and pushing into the scene
[00:44:48] and here we go they're pushing in the next day 28 August D company occupied a harricort
[00:44:54] this is the only operation of war that I ever known to go precisely as planned our supporting
[00:45:01] field regimen softened up the objective with their 25 pounders the company advanced over
[00:45:06] open farmland in a macular formation and consolidated exactly on time the only thing lacking
[00:45:13] was an enemy total bag one day's German one dead German and one dead hair rabbit
[00:45:23] right so the only one that everyone well was when there was no enemy to fight against there was
[00:45:28] there was two Germans one of them was dead the other one was dazed and that was their their last battle
[00:45:35] in France
[00:45:39] back to the book experience and Normandy had removed
[00:45:43] anxieties regarding commanding and under strength put to and so he hasn't had enough man he's supposed
[00:45:48] to have 36 he's had like 17 18 19 in the attack particularly at night up till two
[00:45:53] nip full strength is just too big to maneuver quickly
[00:45:57] three rifle sections of about 20 above about seven man each plus headquarters was ideal
[00:46:04] in defense it was a different matter the more riflemen on the ground the better
[00:46:08] our short stay in the men's ale millon gave me time to think
[00:46:15] the first opportunity to do so since i took command of 18 puttune it also gave me time to
[00:46:21] meet and talk with other young officers in the battalion it was then that I realized that 18
[00:46:27] puttune was no ordinary puttune it had some undefineable magic no quarrels little swearing
[00:46:36] despite the war that was the despite the war there was something peaceful about it
[00:46:40] a helping hand was always available for anybody the emotional links were firm and true
[00:46:50] I was a happy man so he realizes once he starts talking the other puttune commanders
[00:46:56] he's got this really special puttune that gets along great and he's he realizes it
[00:47:03] back to the book no young officer can command a puttune in battle on his own
[00:47:06] in Normandy I'd seen puttune commander served by poor nco struggling to gain some semblance of
[00:47:14] control over their but wielded and frightened men I'd also seen puttunes with good nco's go to pieces
[00:47:22] in the hands of an indifference officer Jim Kingston Doug Proctor and Owen cheeseman set the standard
[00:47:31] n-tone for 18 puttune without them I as the puttune commander would have joined the ranks of so many
[00:47:39] poor young officers who never achieved grip now going to another we're putting together another plan
[00:47:56] as they're advancing and obviously this is a long book I'm doing an abridge version hitting
[00:48:02] some highlights you should get the book obviously get the book by the book back to the book
[00:48:09] at zero four hundred hours on twenty-fourth of September Douglass this is the new company commander
[00:48:15] Douglass held along oh group by candlelight in the seller of the farmhouse at which much to
[00:48:22] his annoyance I kept falling asleep we were ordered to advance straight eastward down a narrow
[00:48:28] country lane from the orchard to the main road and consolidate after the oh group and oh group is
[00:48:36] what they call the when their officers get together and pass the word knick called oh group after the
[00:48:41] oh group I made myself unpopular by asking why we're advancing towards an area of considerable
[00:48:46] German opposition when my patrol found a better route by which we might outflank the enemy so
[00:48:53] that so he's saying hey wait what because his patrol his puttune had been out on a patrol and found
[00:48:58] a better route and he's asking why and he kind of gets shut down I was just twenty years old at the
[00:49:05] time and even then I knew I was incapable of disputing orders without giving a fence we started at
[00:49:12] zero six hundred hours two platoons leading on either side of the track the third falling in
[00:49:17] single filed down the track itself on either side were the small holdings were small holdings
[00:49:22] a few allotments in bungalows surrounded by small picket fences but platoons advanced through the
[00:49:30] gardens and vegetable patches and passed on either side of the bungalows the rear section
[00:49:35] searching each one quickly and while they're searching these little bungalows as their
[00:49:40] own patrol they find this back to the book during one of these hurried searches one section found
[00:49:46] a Dutch family the widdages father mother son and daughter riddled by schmites or fire
[00:49:55] that's a German machine gun they lay in awkward postures of death amid their ransacked home
[00:50:01] a visit from the SS no tears came nor did they come a half an hour later when we came upon
[00:50:11] the charred wreckage of an american decoda it had carried US parachute troops the 82nd airborne
[00:50:17] division and their torn and burnt bodies littered the orchard like charred and mutilated rag dolls
[00:50:23] it was a further iron or irony attached to the front window in what remained of the decoda's
[00:50:32] cockpit was a tiny teddy bear untouched by flames two months before a lonely teddy bear and an
[00:50:40] impersonal pool of blood had brought forth tears now I was collected and objective when faced
[00:50:48] within the span of thirty minutes within a trotious murder and mass carnage by fire and he's
[00:50:55] referring there in the beginning of the book one of his first experiences he's by a slit trench
[00:51:02] and there's a dead guy soldier in it and there's a little teddy bear and and for some reason
[00:51:10] you know he's young he's in experience and it gets gets makes him super emotionally starts crying
[00:51:15] and and now he's a little further in the war he sees you know this horrible murdered family and these
[00:51:23] tragically you know burned and killed paratroopers and he's able to detach emotionally from it
[00:51:34] back to the book the enemy decided to make life unpleasant for us as possible by sudden unpredictable
[00:51:39] concentrations of heavy artillery right in the middle of our company area we called them stunks
[00:51:46] so he's gonna use that word it just means we're getting bombed one of these shells unfortunately
[00:51:51] fell right into one of sixteen platoon slit trenches no trace remained of the two men that were
[00:51:59] manning in it manning a brain in my platoon landscorpo jack Lee and private Peter Filmer
[00:52:07] were buried in the trench they shared other members of their section quickly dug them out unharmed
[00:52:13] very dirty and remarkably cheerful the self-propelled guns increased their activities
[00:52:21] filling the sky above the company with ugly black air bursts they could place these with
[00:52:28] uncanny accuracy to burst about twenty five feet above the road junction outside company headquarters
[00:52:33] the casualties mounted company sergeant major Sammy Jones and spot Martin the Jeepburg driver
[00:52:42] were both hit outside company HQ it was Sammy Jones who committed the battalion's only atrocity
[00:52:51] late one summer evening as the shadows from high trees and hedges fell across a small field
[00:52:57] the Normandy we took some young waffles and saw waffles and SS soldiers prisoner one of them a short
[00:53:05] stocky and fair youth of about eighteen proved insultingly truck-yland season the young
[00:53:13] loud by the scruff of his neck Sammy roared you can take that glint out of your eyes my boy
[00:53:19] and putting the wretched youth across his knees he gave his backside a sound whacking that is
[00:53:28] legit and that's again you know Sydney Jerry and he talks about how proud he is that his men
[00:53:36] his men's behavior is so upstanding throughout this whole miserable experience and even when they
[00:53:46] see atrocities committed like by the SS they still maintain their discipline and their character
[00:53:54] and this is this is what he does oh you you're a little punk kid I'm gonna spank you
[00:54:02] you know tough the SS soldier getting put over the knee and spanked so after the attack so now
[00:54:11] this is again this is happening after one of these attacks and the whole the whole basic premise of
[00:54:18] this book is attack rest attack rest attack rest so as I'm reading I'm kind of picking out some of
[00:54:26] the attacks that they're going on and they're just moving through France and then through Germany that's
[00:54:29] what it is I should've explained that earlier but this is after one of the attacks
[00:54:35] it's interesting he says this smiling faces vanished and the gray look returned once more
[00:54:40] men walked with one air cocked in the air for approaching shells and with a slight stoop
[00:54:47] if you remember when I was talking about JP I was talking about how like you'd see guys they have
[00:54:52] this magical little stoop yeah that's what he's talking about and JP didn't have that no stoop
[00:55:00] JP who stand up like you stoop left he was not yeah he was stoopless he was standing up ready to get
[00:55:05] some but these guys as and it's contrast because when they're on the attack they go into like JP mode
[00:55:13] they're standing up straight they're ready to get some but then once they're on the defense and
[00:55:17] they're just waiting to get shell they start to stoop they start to crouch a little bit he continues
[00:55:22] back to the book the jokes began to peed around and the cheerful good morning surf ceased
[00:55:28] when I went around the platoons at stand two morale was always higher during an attack
[00:55:34] sitting around and being sheldt is not an occupation to be recommended so there's a good lesson there
[00:55:43] if you or your team is being defensive about things your morale is going to go down because you're
[00:55:49] waiting to get hit so go on hit somebody you know go on the attack don't wait around don't let your
[00:55:55] morale drown here's another attack back to the book scrambling out of the culvert we set a fast
[00:56:08] pace up the side of the road to a company's positions this immediately brought small arms fire down
[00:56:15] on us but by then we were then 200 yards of their slit trenches so on we ran as fast as we could
[00:56:21] being soaked I began to steam my boots squelched and seemed to drag me back clawing at my feet as
[00:56:28] in a bad dream and stopping me from reaching the inviting cover of the slit trenches
[00:56:33] a company was dug in with two platoons forward in an orchard face to face to the enemy
[00:56:38] who were in dikes only a few yards beyond the third platoon was to the right rear protecting the
[00:56:44] open flank and company headquarters to the left rear centered on some farm buildings it was to these
[00:56:52] farm buildings that we ran hurling ourselves onto the straw on the barn floor we lay panting
[00:57:00] and gasping for breath john a cock a company commander appeared round the door of the barn
[00:57:07] he looked haggard and warned I doubt he had slept for a week the whole company area was covered
[00:57:16] by the most intense spandell fire and defensive and the defensive battle here was one of fire
[00:57:22] supremacy which the Germans had undoubtedly won a company's morale was low they had just lost
[00:57:29] hairy barns one of the platoon commanders who refusing to take cover strutted about an usual manner
[00:57:36] he took a complete burst of spandell fire under the arm
[00:57:40] hairy was an amazing and fearless fellow who didn't care a damn for anything
[00:57:47] even after the burst hit him he still lived for about three hours
[00:57:53] the men respected hairy and with their idle shot down in front of them they were very jumpy
[00:57:59] another time you have to watch out for morale obviously
[00:58:11] now if you remember this book started in the summer time and now we're starting to get
[00:58:19] towards fall and this this is something I never thought about before
[00:58:24] when fall comes you know the sun is up for a shorter period of time
[00:58:30] so here we go back to the book the nights became longer and the dawns gray and chilly
[00:58:35] the sun sets were red and vivid and the days though beautiful short and rapidly
[00:58:41] as the nights lengthened the hours of staggered lengthened and with them the mental and physical
[00:58:46] fatigue of the company so they have to stay up you know rotate through watches at night
[00:58:54] you just don't get to sleep the whole time so if it's if it's dark for longer you got to stay
[00:58:59] wake longer at night so it's starting to wear on the company itself
[00:59:06] back to the book there was there is one incident small room when remembered by itself
[00:59:11] in a life of such incidents but very but to me very vivid in my platoon there was a young lad aged
[00:59:19] 18 named Biddle he was of slight of build fair and looked a mere child he had a pleasant personality
[00:59:30] and was liked by everyone he had joined the company at La Mensell Millan after we had cross the
[00:59:37] CN at Vernon in August one morning there was a crack in a short interval of silence
[00:59:49] soon the shout went out stretcher bearers echoed through the orchard
[00:59:55] I ran towards the commotion and saw Biddle writhing in agony on the ground
[01:00:00] at first he looked on hurt but as I tore open his tunic I saw clear wound through his abdomen
[01:00:09] coming out by a spine he soon became numb and was no longer in pain but was very frightened and
[01:00:18] shivered we dragged him back behind the house and applied field dressings to his stomach and his
[01:00:26] back in case the wound started to bleed his young life solely ebbbing from his body our stretcher bearers
[01:00:35] quietly and reverently carried him away the scene is now too poignant to remember without shedding
[01:00:44] a tear after Biddle had been evacuated the morale of the platoon dropped
[01:00:51] he had been hit while standing in his slit trench by a sniper at least 300 yards away
[01:01:04] and you know it's it's interesting and I didn't go into this part but there's a part earlier in the book where
[01:01:13] he he basically
[01:01:15] disparages some what the use of snipers and he talks about how they usually don't gain you anything
[01:01:29] tactically but it's interesting what it does to the morale of a platoon isn't it
[01:01:37] and he you know he doesn't completely know he he explains that there's uses and there's
[01:01:41] believe me there's probably no bigger believer in the use of snipers in the world than me but
[01:01:48] it's interesting yeah he he basically you can tell he's a very a guy with you know this extremely high
[01:01:55] moral character and he kind of gets the feeling when he explains it that you know he didn't feel
[01:02:02] comfortable with sniping because people aren't expecting it there's not a battle happening he felt like
[01:02:07] it was a cheap shot but it's interesting the effect that it actually has on his platoon
[01:02:18] in this moment here we're gonna get to a point he's got Germans are in a diek they're just a
[01:02:25] head of 18 18 platoon and 18 platoon is kind of pinned down and remember this character from
[01:02:31] earlier Dennis Clark Dennis Clark was the was the guy that pulled him aside and said hey you need to take
[01:02:36] man to his company well like I said Dennis Clark or I I thought I'd remember and I was right Dennis Clark
[01:02:41] was a was an artillery guy that called an artillery so here we go back to the book I was saved by
[01:02:48] Captain Dennis Clark MC our team gunner Dennis had a virtue also touch where 25 founders were concerned
[01:02:58] sniping with one gun that should get the buggers out he said with total confidence
[01:03:03] moving his 19 set into my that's a radio moving his 19 set into my platoon position no easy task in
[01:03:11] daylight he gave us a display of the most brilliant professionalism we had come to expect from the
[01:03:16] 94th field regiment by firing with only one gun and making his mean point of impact beyond the diek
[01:03:24] containing the Germans he slowly decreased the range yard by yard until one shell exploded in the diek
[01:03:32] out came five very wet and shaken pans or grandadiers during this episode all the platoon had to remain
[01:03:43] in the bottom of their slith trenches because Dennis' shells came over our positions with minimum
[01:03:48] clearance I doubt if any experienced infantry officer would deny that the Royal Artillery
[01:03:54] during the second World War were the most professionally competent people in the British Army
[01:03:59] so again an interesting dichotomy because in the beginning he talks about how the artillery
[01:04:07] can track them because it's being used in this broad plan that's locking in with there's no deviation
[01:04:13] but here he's talking about how brilliant it is because he's directly coordinating with it he's
[01:04:18] explaining to the artillery officer where to put those rounds what the problem is and then letting
[01:04:24] the artillery officer solve it so there's a dichotomy there just like there's a dichotomy with the snipers
[01:04:34] back to the book after a few more days in the orchard we were becoming increasingly exhausted and
[01:04:38] our fighting efficiency deteriorated this condition existed not only in my company but throughout
[01:04:44] the battalion consequently the news of a move back to rest came as a colossal relief to us all
[01:04:50] but we did not know who is going to take over our positions the take over was to be at night
[01:04:57] and was to be carried out as quickly as possible if the enemy discovered it a determined attack could
[01:05:02] cause endless confusion and slaughter during the late afternoon of one particularly unpleasant day
[01:05:08] Douglas appeared that's a company commander appeared within American captain in two
[01:05:12] lieutenant's from a parachute battalion of the hundred and first airborne division they patied
[01:05:18] around the company area in their rubber-sold boots with the eyes of the whole company following them
[01:05:24] it's a hundred and first is coming into a leave him having reckoned ordered our area the
[01:05:29] Americans returned to the company HQ to discuss administrative points for the takeover
[01:05:34] the plan was for the American company commander to bring his company down the main road in
[01:05:38] single file along the edge of the ditch when the head of the column reach our company HQ they would
[01:05:43] be met by guides from each of our platoons to lead the American platoons to their positions
[01:05:47] as soon as they were on the ground our platoons were withdraw and assemble on the road
[01:05:52] this may sound simple in practice at but at night in close contact with the enemy it certainly was not
[01:06:01] this type of operation leaves two companies particularly vulnerable during the handover
[01:06:06] a determined enemy could attack and turn the operation into a massacre
[01:06:10] this is one of and I've said this before on the podcast one of the hardest things to do is
[01:06:15] link up with friendly forces on the battlefield and if you're under fire it's it's even harder
[01:06:22] so this one they're trying to do it not under fire trying to sneak and make it happen
[01:06:28] back to the book the rest of the day was spent packing making sure the enemy noticed nothing of
[01:06:32] this antit activity we put our spare ammunition onto the carriers with great coats and blankets
[01:06:38] the whole afternoon was strangely quiet there was no activity from the enemy and we in turn kept quiet
[01:06:43] the sun went down a mid-a-firey sky looking east the sky was threateningly gray
[01:06:50] I went around I went around my position to with Sergeant Kingston before the Americans arrived
[01:06:57] all my men looked tired and could hardly muster a smile as I went from slit to slit
[01:07:03] many had contained two men and now contained only one
[01:07:07] together with some momento of his former mate a mess tin or a bloodstained jacket even a
[01:07:15] packet of cigarettes wet and limp with dew I wondered how many more momentos would be there
[01:07:25] when the Americans were relieved about an hour later the Americans arrived they loomed up in the
[01:07:33] darkness by the roadside padding along in the rubber sold boots without a whisper
[01:07:39] I fought at the time what splendid troops they were and how excellent their equipment
[01:07:45] I was particularly impressed by the silent and quick way they were led by their squad commanders
[01:07:50] to our section positions so
[01:07:55] there come the Americans who leave them the hundred first airborne division
[01:07:59] who's just outstanding soldiers they're just awesome and we worked with them
[01:08:05] I mean one of my platoon in Ramadi work with the live with them the first the 506
[01:08:11] the band of brothers and you can tell they're the reputation that the guys in Ramadi
[01:08:18] upheld that standard in every possible way but it's rooted all the way back to the soldiers right here
[01:08:25] sounds like this is what struck me when I read that I was like this this that that tradition of
[01:08:31] excellence in that unit has gone from world war to from these guys right here and it's that same
[01:08:38] attitude that I saw with guys in Ramadi the same attitude
[01:08:45] alright now he makes a statement here about this whole big operation which was called market garden
[01:08:53] which was this giant operation to try and caught off the Germans sees multiple bridges and
[01:08:59] there's three bridges they were trying to seize and it it didn't reach its full effect it wasn't
[01:09:06] like a complete mission success they didn't achieve every objective that they wanted to
[01:09:12] so here we go back to the book market garden was a sad operation complete success coming so close
[01:09:18] at a stroke the war in Europe could have been finished in 1944 undoubtedly mistakes were made
[01:09:27] both by the first airborne division particularly their planners and also by 30 core and there was
[01:09:33] no shortage of bad luck however in my experiences in my experience most battles are riddled with
[01:09:40] misfortunes and mistakes and the of the sort found in this operation it was not a failure because
[01:09:47] the ground was taken and a prerequisite to both operation veritable and the rind crossing so wasn't
[01:09:54] like a total failure back to the book I'm convinced that had the supreme commander generalize
[01:10:00] now are given market garden the unqualified support that it justified it would have totally succeeded
[01:10:07] despite its crop of tack coerres and planning and execution I suppose it was just one more
[01:10:13] casualty of the american mania for dispersal of effort however it was without a doubt the most
[01:10:21] exciting and imaginatively planned battle in which 18 puttune ever fought and I'm proud we've
[01:10:26] taken part so he's talking about the folks of effort he's talking about you if you spread yourself
[01:10:31] out to thin you're not gonna you're not gonna make it happen we call that prioritize next hit
[01:10:35] what's the biggest priority let's put our resources there they didn't do that and therefore didn't
[01:10:42] get a full mission success now of course what resources were there what was available there's
[01:10:48] no one has unlimited resources no one if you have that you have no issues right you just crush
[01:10:55] problems with manpower all right so now they're moving beyond market garden and planning
[01:11:05] actually planning he's planning a patrol through a village back to the bup battle school teaching
[01:11:12] at the time prescribed a strength of 12 to 20 for a fighting patrol here again my instincts
[01:11:18] and experience did not conform to their teaching he's a rebel how can you command and control
[01:11:26] that number of men in the dark particularly in a skirmish Douglas the company commander
[01:11:31] tolerant of the absent absonancy of my opinions on these matters left the planning to me
[01:11:40] so cool Douglas is little decentralized command you figure out your plan then I like this the
[01:11:45] composition of the patrol I based on personalities and not on a battle school or day number so
[01:11:52] imagine that you're you're planning based on the personalities of the individuals you have
[01:11:56] the countryside being comparatively open I decided to take a bread gun being steady
[01:12:02] Williams and Filmer would fill the bill admirably if we ran into trouble they could provide
[01:12:08] covering fire for any assault we might make or if things went badly they could cover our
[01:12:12] withdrawal cover move obviously the assault party required strengthening so I decided to take a
[01:12:19] total patrol strength of six men one brand with seven magazines and three armed with stands
[01:12:25] with five magazines and four thirty six grenades each plus a pair of wire cutters I carried my
[01:12:31] cult four grenades and a non-brella my umbrella had been a source of amusement to the
[01:12:37] battoons inside found on the roadside in muc apart from keeping me dry in or out of a slit trench
[01:12:44] it was useful when prodding for mines and brought some fun and color to our lives Jim Kingston and Doug
[01:12:50] Proctor fought otherwise maintaining a disapproving silence which I failed to notice so now they're
[01:12:58] out on patrol moving down the bank the right we crawled forward in the mud and wet grass into
[01:13:01] we're almost past the orchard from which came the sound of digging and voices suddenly a challenge
[01:13:08] came from our front followed by a shower of stick grenades thrown from a trench just inside the
[01:13:14] orchard on our left one of the grenades landed between my legs which were stretched out
[01:13:20] and spread apart as I lay flat on the river bank there was no flash it's explosions seemed
[01:13:26] muffled and more importantly owing to the soft mud I received not a scratch the game was up now
[01:13:35] the concentrated fire of the three stands poured into the German into the surprise Germans putting
[01:13:39] away my pistol I threw three thirty six grenades in quick succession into the orchard heardly
[01:13:46] reaching from my umbrella which alluded me and then enormously, economically we'd be to retreat so
[01:13:57] he gets a graze throw on him and actually had this happen until you bruiser some guys were out on a
[01:14:01] patrol they were an open field they had cover from one side because they had pre-plant how they were
[01:14:07] in a crosses field and while they were out there they got hit with machine gun fire and then mortars
[01:14:11] and they got mortars dating like on them and luckily because it was they were in like a muddy
[01:14:21] field like almost rice paddy scenario the mortars when they hit they went into the mud and so they
[01:14:29] exploded but there was no all the these trappinals all absorbed by the mud that's lucky day for
[01:14:34] the u-briser right there boys were a little more fired up when they came back from that one now they
[01:14:42] get back into a defensive perimeter I remember nights in defensive positions like grows beak stretched
[01:14:48] out in a slit trunch trying to get an hour sleep before going round the platoon positions to check
[01:14:53] that everything and everyone was all right one felt and was dirty and in the small hours of the
[01:15:00] morning with bootlaces cutting into swollen feet of foul tasting mouth and an aching snowmick
[01:15:06] life had little to commend it the dirt and discomfort worried me more than the danger
[01:15:12] danger for some reason that I've never understood exilorates but despite every effort to keep clean
[01:15:19] it did not always prove possible and that was unbearable never once since I never once since
[01:15:28] have I not been grateful to sink into a hop bath or slide into a bed with clean sheets
[01:15:35] we went to extraordinary lengths to keep the dirt at bay once in Normandy I washed and shaved
[01:15:41] in the rainwater in the deep ruts made by carts after words I discovered that 400 yards away
[01:15:49] the opposition had been overlooking my ablutions a decent lot who obviously approved
[01:15:57] of my personal hygiene so they didn't kill him hey this guy's just trying to be clean let's
[01:16:04] let him continue back to the book during the campaign 18 platoon carried out three types of
[01:16:10] patrols reconnaissance standing and fighting the first two invariably useful because they provided
[01:16:17] information if only negative fighting patrols of which I led many were a different and
[01:16:22] contentious proposition unlike the German and American armies we had vigorous policy regarding
[01:16:28] fighting patrols particularly at night and when things were static on both sides on the defense
[01:16:35] the thinking behind this policy seemed to me at times to be superficial and probably left over
[01:16:41] from the great war world war one if when detailed for a fighting patrol young officers
[01:16:47] queried the wisdom of its given object there was always the standard reply I quite agree with you
[01:16:53] but it all helps to dominate no man's land there is undoubtedly a certain validity of this argument
[01:17:01] but was it worth the consequent loss of good young officers and nco's I doubt it
[01:17:07] shortly after the war I was able to briefly voice my reservations to my illustrious army group commander
[01:17:18] that's Montgomery by the way after giving me my MC that's military cross ribbon he stepped back
[01:17:26] and said crispy patrolling his bloody isn't it when I stammered that it seemed a bit hard that
[01:17:34] it was always the same people chosen for patrols he replied with a twinkle as I one day you'll
[01:17:42] command a battalion and you'll understand the problem for 20 year old subaltern exchange like this
[01:17:50] with a field marshal was heavy stuff but Monti's mischievous humor and utter lack of
[01:17:55] formosity coupled with a single-minded professionalism extended his personal influence to the
[01:18:01] most junior soldier in 21st Army group we felt we knew him and that he knew us often he did so
[01:18:14] that's a great little interaction you know he says patrolling his bloody work isn't it and and
[01:18:23] Sydney Jerry says yeah and the thing is it seems like it's always the same platoons that get made to
[01:18:29] do the patrolling and he says one day when you're in charge of battalion you'll understand why that is
[01:18:36] and the reason why that is because you got the good guy and that's the guy you're going to send out
[01:18:40] you're going to rely on the people that get it done
[01:18:49] well this is an interesting we got another patrol that they're getting ready to have to go out on
[01:18:53] and the patrol was to probe between the roads and advance if possible as far as the forest
[01:19:00] beyond this its purpose was indeed vague Douglas called me and another platoon commander to
[01:19:06] company HQ and explained it to us he then suggested we should toss a coin for an embarrassing
[01:19:12] situation arose I thought that the winner would lead the patrol the other officer anticipated that
[01:19:19] the loser would I lost the toss and got the job so so imagine that you and me are saying all right
[01:19:25] there's a dangerous patrol we're going to have to do let's flip for it I'm thinking heads
[01:19:32] if I win I get to do the patrol you're thinking if you win you don't have to do the patrol
[01:19:40] not everyone was quite as fired up I guess this is Sydney Jerry was
[01:19:43] and they they wrap up a relatively kind of un-eventful patrol relatively un-eventful patrol
[01:19:56] and he returns and they're having a cup of tea and some biscuits in true British form
[01:20:03] back to the book it was then that I suddenly realized that I've been commanding 18 platoon for three months
[01:20:08] to be precise three months and two days before I'd join the battalion in mid-July I'd been
[01:20:13] worn that my life expectancy would be about three weeks it seemed strange to me now but at no
[01:20:21] time did I anticipate being either wounded or killed I was just too busy for thoughts like
[01:20:28] reason and I'd become totally absorbed in my grim responsibilities in July I'd been ridden
[01:20:35] by doubt about my ability in my innocence I'd expected success in battle to be the
[01:20:43] prerogative of a Victor Lodorum which is like the champion I now had no such doubts or illusions
[01:20:54] furthermore I discovered just how much soldiers present and fear a young officer who sees battle
[01:21:02] as a means to win his spurs possibly at the cost of their lives so when you grow
[01:21:10] in and you're Mr. beating your chests and you're you're gonna prove yourself to the world
[01:21:17] yeah don't be that guy because you're gonna write checks with my life and we don't like that
[01:21:27] my duty had become clear to me it was to command 18 platoon with quiet confidence
[01:21:32] providing I made them only once my mistakes would be forgiven if my soldiers were to go
[01:21:41] we're going to place their very lives in my hands they in return were fired of me a
[01:21:48] serious attitude to my profession if I could achieve this with a light touch so much the better
[01:21:57] that's an interesting comment so you know he's saying look what they require is I got to be
[01:22:05] serious I got to be a serious as possible and it's like it's like it's like it's heard the term
[01:22:11] minimum force required yes yeah you probably probably use that as a balancer right
[01:22:15] hey you got to use the minimum force required so what he's saying is that as a leader
[01:22:20] the lighter touch the better the lightest touch you can use to lead is better that's
[01:22:25] pretty cool statement that's a good thing to think about how can you lead with minimum force
[01:22:32] every time you go you need to use more than you then you need your your over-exerting right
[01:22:43] and who knows what kind of you know you're taking away initiative you might be stamping out
[01:22:48] morale so lead with that minimum touch I like that so and this point they're in a
[01:22:58] they're in a position and there's three of these mark three 75 millimeter self-propelled
[01:23:04] assault guns so they kind of look like tanks they got big tracks their Germans their German
[01:23:09] and their and they're sitting out in front of them they're in a they're in a static position
[01:23:13] the companies in the static position and there's these these tanks sitting there three of them
[01:23:21] and Douglas looks at them and he's thinking himself hey I don't know what does they they look like
[01:23:26] they're functioning they don't look damaged and so Douglas is saying okay well we need to find
[01:23:33] out what's going on even if there's no one even if there's no one in them right now it could be
[01:23:37] a place where they use snipers later so someone's got to go check them out so Sydney Jerry the guy
[01:23:47] he goes out alone kind of sneaks out there he does stuff alone a little bit more often
[01:23:52] actually does stuff alone there's another story I didn't mention but at one point
[01:23:58] their he hears noise look one of the guy's reports it's nighttime and they hear the
[01:24:03] hear noise in this field they think there's enemy out there and he's like well there's one way to
[01:24:07] find out so he I think he does grab another guy in this occasion but he goes out and he's going through
[01:24:14] this field and it's like a corn field or something and he can't see and he's horrified and he
[01:24:20] he's trying to think of a reason to quit he's like I just want to go back this isn't smart
[01:24:26] and as he's as this is taking place and this is fear is climaxing all of a sudden he hears
[01:24:31] oh, bunch of cows that have fielded right so he's doing another solo operation here
[01:24:42] trying to find out what these tank like assault guns are doing out there back to the book
[01:24:47] climbing up above the tracks I put my head into the coupla which was open a familiar
[01:24:54] interrible stench hit me inside was a sharnell house six inches away a set of bear teeth
[01:25:02] set in unrecognizable black and incinerated lump grinned it me beside it a charred and bony arm
[01:25:11] reached up in agony spread on the floor like a pool of tar lay the melted remains of the driver
[01:25:19] I had entered Dante's inferno my head reeled and with my mouth knows and lungs filled with the
[01:25:30] stench of death I fell back to the ground although unmarked by fire on all on our side all three
[01:25:38] assault guns had brood up and were blackened on their sides which faced the enemy
[01:25:43] with no stomach to look further I ran back to the company for getting to look for American minds
[01:25:51] never again did I look into a knocked-out tank or self-propelled gun
[01:25:56] I reported to Douglas that nobody in the right mind would use them for an observation post or for any other purpose
[01:26:06] later that day he asked that's Douglas Douglas asked the commander of a Sherman tank to fire some
[01:26:12] armor piercing shells into each of them positioning his tank hold down beside 16
[01:26:17] platoon positions which were two are left the tank commanders the tank commander first
[01:26:22] selected the assault gun I had visited his first shell hit it slightly above the tracks
[01:26:29] like the hammer of Vulcan a red glow blossomed on the armor plate around the point of entry and
[01:26:37] slowly faded it was followed by a second and third shell until a morage of heat appeared above it
[01:26:43] and for a second time the funeral pyre blazed with an incandescent ferocity
[01:26:50] the Sherman gunner then turned his attention to the next assault gun which despite being penetrated by
[01:26:56] about six armor piercing rounds failed to brew up his first shot at the third caused a massive
[01:27:03] internal detonation no doubt due to amination stacked within a volcano erupted from its coppola
[01:27:11] sending a dense cloud of black smoke and red sparks into the air a truly
[01:27:19] wagonarian end for the warriors entuned within but it revolted me
[01:27:24] for the rest of the day I brooded this communicated itself to my nco's and soldiers who stole
[01:27:34] mystified glances at my grief for an unknown enemy
[01:27:39] during the afternoon I wandered across the road to a lone house where Dennis Clark had his observation post
[01:27:46] I was looking for solace from a wise and good friend
[01:27:48] a post was filled with gunner officers there must have been a dozen of them
[01:27:54] setting up their equipment and preparation for an attack by 214 brigade
[01:27:59] this activity precluded any solace for me
[01:28:04] immature and undisciplined my imagination ran riot what were they like these men whose already
[01:28:11] incinerated remains had been blasted into oblivion by the 75 millimeter shells of our
[01:28:18] friend in the Sherman my attitude to war was ambivalent undoubtedly I was part pacifist
[01:28:28] but despite an abysmal record in mathematics and particularly in geometry I was
[01:28:33] moderately logical for my age this clearly ruled out total dedication to pacifism
[01:28:42] I had previously discussed the concept of conscious objection with clergy of all
[01:28:47] denominations but none of them could give me constructive answers to my questions
[01:28:54] the privations and suffering of 18 putoon hurt me
[01:29:00] an infantry subaltern is faced with a conflict which cannot be resolved
[01:29:08] one gets emotionally involved with those under one's command
[01:29:12] without this bond few men will respond and consequently little can be achieved
[01:29:22] however to win battles decisions have to be taken and orders given which at times may seem to be
[01:29:31] a betrayal of this trust
[01:29:35] before battle the commander must exude confidence and enthusiasm
[01:29:41] whatever fears his private thoughts may hold just how thin the line divides this
[01:29:48] from deliberate deception I call it the commander's dilemma
[01:29:56] a pretentious phrase but there is nothing to be done about it
[01:30:02] the Nicholas Montserrat's book the cruel sea poor commander Eric Itson makes the point with
[01:30:09] poignancy it's the war the whole bloody war we've just got to do these things and say our prayers at the end
[01:30:24] there was another side possibly caused by adrenaline
[01:30:29] danger attracted and excited me I felt elated and until the battle was over I was impervious to
[01:30:37] exhaustion commanding a platoon embattled demands not only a clear mind but also considerable
[01:30:44] emotional force I suspected is the same transmitted force that exists between a conductor and
[01:30:53] orchestra 40 years later the dilemma of my ambivalence is still unresolved I find the suffering
[01:31:04] inflicted by war unacceptable particularly amongst women children and animals
[01:31:12] thank God I was spared the horrific sights at felays on some days I am a pacifist
[01:31:20] and yet I'm still attracted by the sounds of guns and but for an extraordinarily happy marriage
[01:31:27] would have found it difficult to resist the lore of soldiering
[01:31:38] so what he calls the commanders dilemma this one I call the dichotomy of leadership and that one is the
[01:31:47] premier of them all and that is as a leader as a combat leader you are going to love your men
[01:32:04] and care about them more than anything else in the world and with that you are going to
[01:32:13] make decisions and make plans where you are sending those men into a situation where they can be wounded
[01:32:23] or killed and that's it and that is the ultimate dichotomy of leadership that is the hardest one to balance
[01:32:33] it back to the book a new officer arrived named Humphrey's he used to play cricket for warstisher
[01:32:51] he came on the same day that sergeant Oxlyn received a well-earned commission in the field
[01:32:56] Douglas told him about sergeant Oxlyn and with great consideration he went to 17
[01:33:02] platoon's position to offer his congratulations while they talked just one salvo of one oh five
[01:33:10] straddled them one shell fell into second lieutenant Oxlyn's slit trench and both were killed instantly
[01:33:18] like me can Oxlyn has survived five months Humphrey's survives not a full day
[01:33:32] is there a mathematical formula by which survival can be calculated
[01:33:39] who are the survivors and can they be recognized over the past 40 years I've often pondered this
[01:33:46] but still offer no real answer I suspect however that is something to do with attitude attitude
[01:33:54] seems to me to be a parameter which restricts not only our relationships but also our creative effort
[01:34:04] further comment is on wise Humphrey's one cargue had little time to develop an attitude
[01:34:11] to our kind of existence undoubtedly a self-fulfilling circle develops newcomers inexperienced in the
[01:34:20] perils of the battlefield suffered the highest casualties knowledge of what can and what cannot be
[01:34:28] wrists post-pones the fatal reckoning for the soldier for the commander however junior battle
[01:34:37] field experience will not only protect himself but also all those under his command
[01:34:46] and that's that's why training is so important it's so important and that's why when I got
[01:34:54] done with you know deployment to her body that's why I went to training because I knew that right there
[01:35:01] and I was thinking you know I didn't know I was wrong the war was going to last and when we left
[01:35:04] for money where money was still horrible and when the task unit came in relieved us man they were
[01:35:10] getting after it and I didn't know long that was going to last I mean it ended up not lasting that
[01:35:16] much longer that kind of intense fighting but it was impossible to tell at that time we would just
[01:35:23] barely seeing stuff start to get better at the end of our deployment just barely starting to see
[01:35:29] the first indications of that back to the book the fifth Duke of Cornwall's light infantry
[01:35:44] had attempted to attack Hove and village through these ghastly woods and had taken heavy casualties
[01:35:50] their reign soaked bodies littered the paths and clearings while carrying out a reconnaissance I
[01:35:57] came across one of their sections lying along a small path facing the enemy
[01:36:04] at first I fought them alive until I saw that the studs on their boots were rusty
[01:36:09] and their webbing equipment was bleached with rain their battle dress was starched with mud
[01:36:15] and their hands and faces were green German booby traps were on or near many of the tracks
[01:36:23] and I was told by the company commander of the fourth wheelchairs from whom we took over the position
[01:36:29] that some of the bodies were also booby trapped don't try to bury them he said
[01:36:37] I was temporarily commanding the company because Douglas had been given a well deserved leave in
[01:36:42] Brussels although militarily comparatively un-adventful Hove and has a special place in my memories
[01:36:48] it was without doubt my most the most grizzly and horrifying position that we ever hold held
[01:36:54] but more importantly it was the place of private Charles Raven's triumph
[01:37:02] Raven had fought in all our battles since hill 112 which to him was a yardstick of horror
[01:37:10] all subsequent experience was compared with that his first battle
[01:37:14] he was no soldier I doubt if he influenced greatly any of the skirmishes and counters or battles
[01:37:23] in which he took part sometimes he was frightened and he was so out of place on the battlefield
[01:37:29] that I often wondered how he became an infantry soldier before the war he had been a clerk in north
[01:37:36] London I'm sure he was a conscientious and loyal employee and a considerate and loving husband
[01:37:44] for unlike most of us he was married Raven had hidden depths and could be inspired
[01:37:54] once in Normandy during a nasty little platoon attack up a sunken lane 18 platoon was held up by
[01:38:00] the inevitable unlocated spandows straining my eyes through binoculars I was trying
[01:38:07] vainly to locate these guns when I was handed a steaming mug of tea he should have been
[01:38:14] observing to his front but judging the moment right he had brewed a mess tin of tea on a solid fuel stove
[01:38:21] by any standards this was an inspired act he was considerate with our reinforcements pale
[01:38:31] unsure men some of whom until recently it served in the royal artillery and it been transferred
[01:38:37] to infantry regiments to replace the appalling losses incurred in the Normandy Bocage
[01:38:44] beside them Raven looked bronze in weather beaten a hardened campaigner
[01:38:50] complete with a German luger pistol to prove it some of the platoon regaled the reinforcements
[01:38:57] with horrible tails from Normandy and else as little more than a schoolboy I found these stories
[01:39:04] amusing Raven did not fear for him was horribly real and never to be joked about he developed a
[01:39:16] eternal attitude toward the newer and younger soldiers a relationship devoid of patronage
[01:39:21] but essentially one of kindly understanding he spoke to me about it when I thanked him for his help
[01:39:31] I admit I'm dead windy sir his extraordinary honesty with himself and the rest of the platoon
[01:39:38] forbade him to attempt to hide the fact Raven in overtaxed his nervous and physical resources
[01:39:45] long before we arrived in hoven woods after two days in the position he came to me late one
[01:39:52] evening and asked my permission to report sick the following morning I suppose I should
[01:40:00] and fettically have refused but something made me hesitate and avoid dealing directly with the
[01:40:05] situation I said simply all right Raven but do come see me before you leave
[01:40:10] he didn't come the matter was never again mentioned I can only surmised the struggle which
[01:40:21] rage in his mind all that night while he crouched in his waterlogs slit trunch peering into the
[01:40:27] sinister darkness of the wood I do know however that in hoven wood a considerable moral triumph
[01:40:38] over stark horror was achieved by a good man unequipped for nature unequipped by nature for war
[01:40:48] in my view the bravest of the brave so that guy Raven had been through all this stuff and
[01:40:58] just barely held the line and finally he was going to break finally he was going to break
[01:41:04] and he comes to city gerian says hey I'm gonna go sick tomorrow send the gerian says okay come
[01:41:10] and see me before you go it doesn't come back it doesn't come back to him doesn't go sick
[01:41:19] back to the book infantry warfare is wretched business it makes physical and emotional demands
[01:41:25] on participants that run contrary to all human instinct the strong minority must quietly help
[01:41:32] the weak majority to me that is the essence of good teamwork and that jewel in the crown of the
[01:41:39] British army the regimental system is the strong foundation upon which we all knowingly or unknowingly
[01:41:47] relied so there's going to be some people that deal with it better than others
[01:41:57] and you got to help um here's a situation they set up early warning flares so little trip wires
[01:42:11] in case to to notify them if the enemies move and down one of their flanks and here we go back to the
[01:42:18] book after about 10 minutes had passed we heard the popping of mortars behind hoven village in a
[01:42:22] concentration of bombs fell in the fields where we had laid the flares suddenly our left flank
[01:42:27] was vividly illuminated as flair after flair ignited knowing little about these flares we had laid
[01:42:35] them with the trip wires to talk had we allowed a degree of slack the flares were not a
[01:42:40] vergnited my fault I should have known had to fill the extreme ownership from Sydney Jerry and therefore y'all
[01:42:56] now he's talking about the attitudes of the soldiers and how soldiers you know there was a
[01:43:03] claim he read an article years after the war that said that people you know people became brutal
[01:43:09] from the from the war and here's what he says back to the book does war brutalize one can only
[01:43:17] speak from personal experience but I think not certainly no soldier of mine was made brutal rather the
[01:43:24] opposite war developed in 18 puttune consideration for comrades and humanity towards civilians
[01:43:32] and prisoners of war I was proud of my soldiers then and this sentiment has increased with the passing
[01:43:39] of years I would not suggest that the naturally brutal might not find in war and outland for their
[01:43:46] brutality however that war does not brutalize the type of decent man the type of decent and fair-minded
[01:43:54] young English men whom I had the very great honor to command we were not an aggressive generation
[01:44:02] a fact which may explain my failure to understand some present day attitudes in the armed
[01:44:06] services particularly in the royal marines and the parachute regimen possibly a degree of personal
[01:44:15] aggression is appropriate in troops are who are committed to battle for comparatively short periods
[01:44:21] like the marines and the paras when the success of an operation depends on ultra rapid action
[01:44:27] however in my experience troops lose personal aggression after about two months in battle
[01:44:35] after three months they acquire a mature compassion which in no way detracts from their offensive
[01:44:42] capability they simply know a lot more about war I would suggest that personal aggression should
[01:44:50] not be confused with offensive spirit based on professional competence and experience
[01:44:59] interesting take that aggression that you can maintain if you it's not going to last rubber
[01:45:07] and and then you're going to have to fall back on duty and and that mature compassion
[01:45:20] which isn't taken away from their offensive capability
[01:45:29] interesting
[01:45:30] back to book on the eleventh of January we returned to the south of the union just to go back
[01:45:40] to that one piece right there dichotomy leadership there's a dichotomy and everything and
[01:45:46] you know obviously I'm a big proponent of being aggressive and I also always talk about the fact
[01:45:52] that there is such a thing being too aggressive you're running to your death no not a good idea
[01:45:58] not a good idea and there's probably a good chance that when he talks about people
[01:46:03] after two months of combat everyone starts to develop a different type of attitude also
[01:46:09] the people that were ultra aggressive didn't make it like the like the leader that he talked about
[01:46:14] that was strutting around the guy was ultra aggressive didn't care about anything and he's dead
[01:46:20] so there's a balance you got to have that's the dichotomy leadership that's why the dichotomy
[01:46:24] of leadership is so important and so hard to understand back to the book on the day after the
[01:46:34] batain was relieved and hoven wood someone I suspect I suspect it was the adjutant
[01:46:40] Tim Watson decided that I should enjoy 48 hours on leave in Antwerp I was overjoyed
[01:46:48] the large hotel although faded was still plush and filled with officers including women
[01:46:54] ATS officers from the various base units stationed in the city
[01:46:59] dressed as I had left the battlefield I was both the shavold and soiled
[01:47:04] surrounded by the residents many of whom were in service dress I could not have felt more isolated and
[01:47:10] lonely so he's getting some leave time but he's showing up off the battlefield to grimey my first
[01:47:18] map visit was to a magnificent white marble gentleman's hair dressing salon in the basement of a hotel
[01:47:25] without a word the barber washed and rinsed my hair twice before touching it with his precious
[01:47:30] scissors and clippers I remember the feeling of well-being as climbing the stairs I returned to my room
[01:47:38] Next I took three very hot baths one after the other to rid myself of grime both physical
[01:47:47] and emotional I think I must have slept for 14 hours before I rose shaved took another bath
[01:47:55] and decided to explore the city
[01:47:59] A rather creased battle dress was my best suit and in this I descended the main staircase into
[01:48:06] the lounge which was filled with the resident officers all of whom seemed to be a knowingly self-assured
[01:48:15] I met a barrier I had walked out of a world that I knew into one where I was desperately
[01:48:22] unsure of myself away from the battlefield this world had no place for me I did not go out to lunch
[01:48:34] go to night clubs or meet the girls who were everywhere seemed to be canvassing
[01:48:40] for these establishments I had wandered too far into dark and smokey battlefields across the
[01:48:48] sticks to find solace or comfort in the bright lights behind the black-out curtains of Antwerp
[01:48:54] I long to return to the battalion and to 18-platoon which without my knowing it had become my home
[01:49:08] with a light heart a clean body freshly laundered clothes and refreshed by hours of unbroken
[01:49:15] sleep I gladly climbed into the three-ton truck that took me there
[01:49:18] years later I found the same problem after I left the army
[01:49:26] Antwerp had been a small taste of the real world and as anyone who has served with good
[01:49:32] soldiers on grim battlefields will confirm afterwards real life never seems real again
[01:49:39] later there was no 18-platoon to slink back to and without a loving wife it would have proved
[01:49:50] intolerable well that's the feeling that that we get when you get done doing that job
[01:50:06] and real life never seems real again in comparison I know the vets that are listening to
[01:50:18] understand that part back to the book on 11 January we returned to the South of Holland this time
[01:50:25] to ganglet snow lay on deeply frozen ground and life for the entry and life for the infantry
[01:50:34] manning their slit trenches became unbearable again the battalion front was extensive
[01:50:41] decomponing was in reserve closed close to battalion headquarters on the edge of town
[01:50:46] fortunately gangl it was on a reverse slope which allowed us to move freely during daylight hours
[01:50:53] the cold was penetrating the oil in our automatic weapons froze and until anti-free's
[01:50:59] lubricants were issued our brands were useless holding a wide front with large gaps between
[01:51:07] our company positions necessitated putting out many standing patrols particularly at night
[01:51:14] the privations suffered by these small patrols usually a corpile and three or four men
[01:51:19] were harder than the rest of us some had hallucinations and if you were exactly evacuated
[01:51:25] suffering from exposure keeping fit warm and clean became a great effort
[01:51:33] conversation dried up the platoon became quiet but never merouse
[01:51:39] at one stage I decided they needed cheering up and I wandered around the section post
[01:51:43] ready to chat with all of them it was quite unnecessary I had wrongly judged their mood
[01:51:49] they just wanted to be left alone
[01:52:01] now there's a begin by the book and read the book there's a chaotic battle at a
[01:52:07] pace place called cleave and after the battle at cleave he kind of de-briefs here
[01:52:13] back to the book what instructors at the school of infantry would think about the fighting
[01:52:18] cleave I shuttered a think there resembled no other battle in my experience I had little control
[01:52:23] and it developed into a section commander's battle looking back over the years it seems military
[01:52:29] the totally unprofessional a real wild west chewed out
[01:52:34] tactically the Germans had every advantage we were strung out in a long column amid shattered
[01:52:40] buildings and piles of rubbles with the groups of parachute troops attacking from both sides
[01:52:45] they could sniper us and engage with our with their spandals
[01:52:51] from dozens of positions totally hidden by piles of rubble
[01:52:57] they had the opportunity to concentrate their counter attacks on the narrowest of fronts
[01:53:02] but failed to do to do so so they failed to focus their efforts
[01:53:07] I can only assume that we had the psychological advantage the circumstances being so chaotic and disorganized
[01:53:13] perhaps being Germans they could not overcome their instinct for organization and tightiness
[01:53:20] in the end they departed possibly and discussed leaving us undisputed victors
[01:53:33] on another attack the Germans at this point are retreating
[01:53:38] and they can see that they're retreating
[01:53:40] fearing that the retreating parachute troops would make a stand on the edge of the wood
[01:53:43] I increased the rate of advance joining Lance Corporal Portius in the forward section
[01:53:50] running across the level crossing I suddenly found myself face to face with a germinplatoon
[01:53:55] complete with MG 34 fortunately the gun was mounted on a tripod which was unusual
[01:54:01] and could not be traversed in our direction from a drainage channel on the left of the road
[01:54:07] a parachute is leaped up swath and camouflage veil pointing a schmiser at me from about 10 yards range
[01:54:14] he fired a whole magazine of about 30 rounds
[01:54:19] it was like watching a slow running silent movie I didn't hear the chatter of the schmiser
[01:54:24] but I do remember seeing the stream of empty cartridge cases fly from the German machine gun
[01:54:30] miracles do indeed happen one nine millimeter bullet went through my beret
[01:54:38] missing my head literally by hairs with another went under the appleet of my jacket
[01:54:46] penetrating the webbing across brace the webbing cross brace of my equipment and grazing my
[01:54:51] right shoulder a third bullet ricochet off the surface of the road and disintegrated
[01:54:56] the jacket finally lodging in the palm of my right hand then came the anti climax
[01:55:04] the German looked at me in amazement through ways smiser and eye with a shrug of the shoulders
[01:55:10] he surrendered my natural relation was short lived behind me lay Lance Corporal Portius
[01:55:19] shot through the heart some of the German platoon ran away across the open fields to our
[01:55:26] left and were cut down by rapid fire brand gun by sergeant Kingston section
[01:55:33] which now line the railway track to left the road the remainder of the enemy came towards us
[01:55:39] over the level crossing with their hands raised we took 57 prisoners
[01:55:49] now they're moving along and they are clearing some cottages and they get to this one cottage
[01:55:54] filled with rough wooden bunks it had obviously served as an air raid shelter the house having
[01:55:59] been found clear of enemy jackly was off as guard as he descended the steps suddenly from under a
[01:56:04] pile of blankets left the fanatical German paratrooper the only fanatical German paratrooper we encountered
[01:56:11] the entire battle a large manny sees jack around the throat in an attempt to strangle him
[01:56:16] private fluid rose to the challenge in a bound he was down the steps and with a mighty lunge
[01:56:23] transfixed the German on his bayonet a brave lad he undoubtedly saved Lance Corporal
[01:56:30] Lee's life just eight days before losing his own the German was indeed unlucky as it was the only
[01:56:37] occasion throughout the campaign on which 18 pltunes bayonets were bloodied we usually use them to
[01:56:44] open food cans having checked the pltune positions and arcs of fire for the brins exhaustion
[01:56:53] hit me i fell into a deep sleep during the evening a senior officer i understand it was either
[01:57:00] brigade or divisional commander came out to my company position when he asked to speak to me sergeant
[01:57:06] Kingston refused to have me wakened i'm sure that Jim was the most diplomatic about it but it says
[01:57:12] much for our visitors humanity that he let it go by another attack a and c companies were
[01:57:28] unleashed and passing b company secured their objectives against some opposition
[01:57:34] there was now our turn d company advanced across the flat open fields
[01:57:39] down the left hand side of the main road into zan ten it's a name of the city
[01:57:48] village casualties from the preceding companies in the opposition lay all around
[01:57:53] about 300 yards short of the town were extremely accurately engaged by a battery of 105s
[01:58:00] some of their shells exploded on the hard surface the road your splitting detonations
[01:58:04] and frightening fragmentation pieces of shell casing hummed and wind around us one trolling peace
[01:58:11] embedded itself with a foot into the trunk of a tree a few inches from my right ear
[01:58:16] was the only time in the whole campaign when i regretted throwing away my steel helmet
[01:58:23] i think it was the accuracy and the intense noise of the shelling that caused it one of 18
[01:58:29] pertunes lance corpoles a big man who had served honorably since market garden went to pieces
[01:58:37] there was a pathetic site and to everyone's credit he was quietly removed from the battle
[01:58:44] he had passed his limit and nothing more can be said
[01:58:51] so you don't know these guys are brave at one moment and then a week a month two months
[01:58:57] four months they can't do it anymore
[01:59:05] they get across the line now they're fully in Germany there's a little bit of a low in the
[01:59:11] fighting back to the book early one morning while we were waiting for our supporting armor to arrive
[01:59:16] our podry john Williams drove over to see us after wandering around the platoon for a chat he
[01:59:22] suggested he suggested that we should go for a short stroll i had now been commanding 18
[01:59:28] platoon for over eight months and i suspect that our agitant Tim Watson a kindly soul had asked him
[01:59:37] to find out what shape i was in we had not gone far into the next field when he came across
[01:59:45] some grizzly remnants one of our artillery shells must have exploded right at the feet of a
[01:59:50] German soldier who had been digging a slit trench his splintered and twisted spade lay beside
[01:59:59] laid by the side of that half dug trench beside which was a small shell hole he had been
[02:00:06] disintegrated into small pieces of flesh and bone which they scattered all over the field
[02:00:11] had I been on my own I would no doubt have shuttered and quickly departed from this horror
[02:00:20] draped over a wire fence nearby lay a parachute which are extraordinarily brave podry
[02:00:27] spread out as a shroud on the cold and damp grass then stupid he walked around the field
[02:00:34] a lonely figure reverently picking up every piece of that poor soldier to my shame i stood and
[02:00:44] watched him i lacked the courage to help somewhere beneath those flat damp fields just north of the
[02:00:57] line that pallet it pathetic bundle must still lie
[02:01:12] now they're in attack again but it seems like things are going their way and we're going he's
[02:01:21] kind of giving a brief to his to his runner when all of a sudden he hears yelling back to the
[02:01:28] book sir they're charging us sure enough from about 150 yards ahead of well spread out line of
[02:01:34] about 20 Germans were putting in a bayonet charge brave lads they didn't stand a chance
[02:01:41] I gave no orders except cease fire not one got within 75 yards of us a few minutes later
[02:01:55] a possession of Germans with stretchers and a huge red flag emerged from the village behind
[02:02:00] when they were close to their casualties they hesitated so i stood up and waved them on
[02:02:05] all our unarmed stretcher bears and they moved across our front collecting their dead and wounded
[02:02:13] when they had finished their task of mercy one of them i think he must have been a German
[02:02:18] medical officer turned and saluted in our direction i returned the salute and with that gesture
[02:02:26] the tiny battle of cinder and ended in bremen little over a month later one of our stretcher bears
[02:02:36] Lance Corporal J. Stevens was killed by a German grenade as he went to tend to wounded German soldier
[02:02:42] 18 platoon remembering cinder and were justifiably outraged by such unsolderly behavior
[02:03:00] there is a mathematical formula aggression increases the further one goes behind the lines
[02:03:07] opposing infantry with few exceptions like the SS are joined by a natural bond of mutual compassion
[02:03:14] which few but the aristocracy of the battlefield can understand
[02:03:20] the public influence no doubt by writers with literal no experience of battle have strange and
[02:03:25] sometimes silly ideas about what makes a good soldier ill informed television programs
[02:03:31] of added to this misunderstanding few professions can be have been so misleadingly caricatured
[02:03:39] i had had i been asked at the time before august 1944 to list the personal characteristics
[02:03:44] which go to make a good infantry soldier my reply would indeed have been why to the mark
[02:03:49] why to the mark like most i know doubt one of suggested only masculine ones like aggression
[02:03:56] physical stamina a hunting instinct instinct and competitive nature how wrong i would have been
[02:04:04] i would now suggest the following firstly sufferance without which one could not survive so he's
[02:04:14] listing what he thinks the most important characteristics for a for an infantry soldier out of the first
[02:04:18] one is sufferance the ability to suffer secondly a quiet mind which enables a
[02:04:25] soldier to live in harmony with his fellows through all sorts of difficulties and sometimes under
[02:04:30] dreadful conditions as in a closed monastic existence there's simply no room for the assertive
[02:04:39] or acrimonious thirdly below no less important a sense of the ridiculous which helps the soldiers
[02:04:49] are mount the unacceptable add to these a reasonable standard of physical fitness and a dedicated
[02:04:57] professional competence and you have a soldier for all seasons none of the soldiers or nco's who made
[02:05:05] 18-platoon what it was resembled the characters portrayed in most books and films about war
[02:05:11] all quiet sensible unassuming and some by any standard were heroes if i now had to select a team
[02:05:25] for a dangerous mission and my choice was restricted to stars of the sports field or poets
[02:05:32] I would unhazitatingly recruit from the latter very interesting and i mean obviously you have to
[02:05:50] put this in the context of of his time but there's no doubt that i mean you get a sports star
[02:06:00] especially these days those guys that are getting paid 20 30 40 million dollars a year to play a
[02:06:07] game that they're probably not going to be the best at suffering and a trench
[02:06:16] interesting and i think the key point of that is what he's going back to what he talks about
[02:06:23] earlier is someone that can think someone that can think someone that is not trapped in in thinking
[02:06:33] the same faulty everyone else which certainly an artist or a poet has to be outside the box of normal
[02:06:40] fought otherwise they become that they don't become that right in this situation
[02:06:55] is platoon is kind of pinned down and there's an air raid shelter which has someone in it
[02:07:04] is firing these things called a pans or files which is like a it's kind of like a bazooka or
[02:07:08] like an RPG looking thing and he sees where it's coming from and he sees that it's this shelter
[02:07:16] but he doesn't know who's in the shelter here we go back to the kuhu who else was in the shelter
[02:07:20] women and children sheltering more enemy soldiers with more pans or files than spandas
[02:07:28] we were in a vulnerable situation and it was no good pushing forward and ignoring the
[02:07:32] menace lurking inside that shelter i could have sent two or three men to clear it however
[02:07:38] experience a top me that when clearing sellers that the first man sent in is invariably killed
[02:07:46] instead concentrated fire was poured into the entrance included gapiat bomb
[02:07:53] around us the battle still raged and no opportunity to arose from the idea for me to inspect
[02:07:59] the consequences of an awful decision nevertheless my duty was to win battles and not to
[02:08:08] gamble with the lives of my soldiers by fussing over two sensitive conscience so there you go
[02:08:15] there's dichotomy for you at the one hand he's looking at this shelter thinking there might be
[02:08:18] women and kids in there but at this moment in time he doesn't have time to find out and doesn't have
[02:08:22] time to take of the most cautious route so they hammer it with machine gun fire and some
[02:08:28] anti-tank rounds he never even goes to look but he knows that he can't his duty is to win battles
[02:08:36] and he can't diddy dally because he has a sensitive conscience doesn't work
[02:08:47] back to the book Bremer Haven was our final objective it was fifth of May 1945
[02:08:54] 19 days before my 21st birthday think about what you were doing you were doing
[02:09:00] and that's what it's just ready to break out we were concentrated at will-stet
[02:09:09] about 20 miles north of Bremen when the end came and by the end I mean the end of the war
[02:09:18] 129 brigades order was stand down and spliced the rain brace which is a military it's actually
[02:09:27] a navy term spliced the main brace means like drinking light is lit you can drink the war's over
[02:09:35] I had just given orders for our small part in the brigades move forward against 15
[02:09:39] Panzer Division one of the famous Africa core formations in 1983 Jim Kingston gave me his copy
[02:09:47] of those orders which he had kept all those years
[02:09:52] reaction to the end of the war like aggression increased further behind the lines one went
[02:10:00] the natural aristocracy of the battlefield the infantry having fired a photo joy
[02:10:06] of very lights curled up and slept we had learned too much to indulge in shallow demonstrations
[02:10:15] so everyone's all fireworks and getting crazy these guys are like cool I'm going to sleep
[02:10:22] since July we had come a long way from the Normandy beach head the battalion had lost 47
[02:10:29] officers and 1,266 NCOs and private soldiers killed or wounded
[02:10:36] after July 31st 1944 no member of 18 platoon was put on a charge no one went absent or deserted
[02:10:49] of the original 36 NCOs and soldiers who had landed in Normandy only corpable cheeseman remained
[02:10:55] one man many came after them and lasted a few days weeks or months
[02:11:07] few I was able to thank adequately I doubt if any of them realized how much I personally owed 18
[02:11:15] platoon when I joined them on 31st July I was naive and gouge due to a narrow upbringing except for
[02:11:27] a passionate love of music my intellect and emotions were unstimulated my achievement at school had
[02:11:34] been a bismal my mind was undisciplined and confidence in myself nil this was rapidly swept away
[02:11:43] probably within three weeks certainly before we crossed the sin on the 28th of August
[02:11:51] discovering an ability to command a group of men some frightened and bewildered produced
[02:11:57] a new found confidence particularly since I seem to be able to achieve it quietly and without
[02:12:03] acrimony or fuss having to improvise tactics to overcome the shortcomings of battle school training
[02:12:11] also helped it proved to me that in some circumstances older and more experienced than I
[02:12:18] others older and more experienced than I could be wrong I suspect that as an only child I had been
[02:12:24] brought up in too much of my elders a new world had opened before me forethought and planning were
[02:12:33] demanded a imagination and instinct too was that apparently quiet normandy lane lethal the intense
[02:12:44] spanned outfire and ordering a long a diek was it a prelude to an enemies withdrawal did the
[02:12:49] orchard in front of the village hide 88s my judgment in these things had proved equal to better than
[02:12:56] most of than the most and it was the making of me it also brought a few problems I'm now only
[02:13:05] able to plan and run things in my way as a result I'm probably unemployable however I would never
[02:13:14] wish to change places with the shy hesitant boy whom circumstances put in command of 18ble tune
[02:13:20] age 20 I was far too young and inexperienced to appreciate that an infantry platoon was the finest
[02:13:27] command in the army and that's the success or failure of a battle so often lay solely in the hands
[02:13:33] of a young officer after careful reflection I doubt that at any time since the war have I
[02:13:42] carried the burden of responsibility that I bore as a subaltern in battle when an army corps division
[02:13:53] or brigade was committed to battle it was the battalion company in platoon commanders who took over
[02:13:58] the mantle of responsibility from the generals and brigadiers in close country for us and street
[02:14:06] fighting the platoon commander became the lynch pin only the company and platoon commanders particularly
[02:14:13] the latter were able to have close relationship with their soldiers which is a prerequisite
[02:14:19] for having above average success failure by one infantry company could record a divisional battle plan
[02:14:27] conversely gallant success like B company at Xan 10 underwrote the battalions victory
[02:14:37] again I would emphasize the analog with the bond of professional respect between a great conductor
[02:14:43] and the members of a symphony orchestra without which a truly great performance is not possible
[02:14:49] outstanding performances cannot be arranged in a concert promoters office the created by
[02:14:56] some magic by the conductor in players in rehearsal and performance similarly while senior commanders
[02:15:03] appreciated the strengths and weaknesses of their battions and brigades they could not extract
[02:15:08] a great performance from the riflemen upon whom victory depended only the company of platoon
[02:15:16] commanders supported by their NCOs could ensure that 42 years on I get considerable satisfaction
[02:15:26] from 18 platoon successes more so than I got at the time
[02:15:30] so those are his thoughts and he's the wars now over and a few days after the war ended
[02:15:48] well go to the book after cholera and noculations we were conducted into the world of Frankenstein
[02:16:00] nothing had prepared us for what we now experienced not hill one twelve not mount pinchon
[02:16:07] else or hoven could compete with this horror before the incredulous eyes of 18 platoon spread
[02:16:16] over acres of delightfully wooded countryside was a factory of death
[02:16:23] and they sheaded bodies resembling wax effigies of an alien race from a strange and distant planet
[02:16:30] filled many pits the stench of death and the sight of such highly industrialized
[02:16:38] human degradation left my soldiers speechless private macy d companies deep driver
[02:16:49] aptly summed it up there is now no doubt that we have fought a just war
[02:16:57] that's after they saw the concentration camps obviously
[02:17:13] back to the book within a month of the war ending 21st Army group was required to supply
[02:17:18] junior officers for the 14th Army in Burma
[02:17:22] lipy the commanding officer decided that I should be one of them and by then being intent on a
[02:17:29] military career I was not inclined to argue I would gain useful experience of jungle warfare
[02:17:37] of which I knew nothing about so they're getting orders still a war going on in the
[02:17:43] Pacific oh you wrapped up pushing from normandy through germany through their surrender
[02:17:48] guess well we need we need people to go to fight in Asia we need people in Burma
[02:17:57] I was totally unprepared for the platoons for the emotions that were unleashed immediately
[02:18:05] after I was deprived of 18 platoon as a Jeep took me away from the battalion a gas-lead
[02:18:14] desolation and golf to me I felt like a small boy on his way to a grim and unknown boarding school
[02:18:24] the pleasures of commanding 18 platoon and peace time were being denied me
[02:18:28] and it's interesting so he gets pulled away from his platoon and he goes and talk about
[02:18:45] what happened to the guys that survived that he knew and I found this part to be fascinating in the
[02:18:53] how these people went back to normal life back to the book Jim Kingston was demobilized in
[02:19:03] January 1946 and two months later he returned to his civilian post with the Bristol
[02:19:09] Corporation Electricity Department retired in 1975 never married Doug Proctor returned home to
[02:19:17] his wife and baby son and not in Hammond March of 1946 found the transition from army to civilian
[02:19:23] life painless returning to his accounting post in the coal industry
[02:19:31] oh and cheeseman during the first few days of his demobilization is wife died
[02:19:38] miserable and forlorn he returned to his old job in Covent Garden and a few years later
[02:19:44] he met in married Bella who in his own words was a comfort and inspiration to him
[02:19:53] Charles Raven joined the London Transport as a bus conductor
[02:19:59] later transferring to the clerical staff and rose by hard work and study to be a garage inspector
[02:20:04] Joe Thomas and George Harris went into the building trade industry in Bridgewater
[02:20:21] surprisingly just incredibly normal paths after this incredibly not normal life and
[02:20:31] and what happened to Sydney Jerry so here's what happened to Sydney Jerry back to the book
[02:20:37] arriving in England on 9th July 1945 I reported to the holding battalion of the Hampshire
[02:20:45] Regiment at Westgate on sea and was immediately sent on 28 days leave after night out in London with
[02:20:54] three friends also berm a bound I telephone my parents and found them away
[02:21:02] caught a train from waterloo and went to see them staying at the same hotel as my parents were
[02:21:10] flight lieutenant Jack weatherlies widow Peggy and their three-year-old daughter Anne
[02:21:17] we're staying at the same hotel as his parents at once a bond of deep understanding and affection
[02:21:22] developed between us in August and Adam Baum was dropped and so at a stroke my visit to Burma was
[02:21:32] rendered pointless so two in my heart was a military career I soldiered on in Libya and Palestine
[02:21:43] with the first battalion of my own regiment for two more interesting years and finally was demobilized
[02:21:49] in May of 1947 within a week of leaving the army I attended a job interview the managing
[02:22:02] director who saw me a pale and thin-lipped man was a business acquaintance of a relative
[02:22:09] he eyed me coldly slowly and precisely from his desk he lifted a ruler which he rudely pointed
[02:22:18] at my face I understand that you made a slight name for yourself in the war be that as it may
[02:22:26] people like you Jerry should remember that while you have been galleventing around the world
[02:22:31] most of my staff had remained loyal to the company if you can give me one valid reason why
[02:22:38] should even consider you for any position I should be interested to hear it I nearly hit him now I
[02:22:49] wish that I had quickly grabbing my hat no umbrella I rose and told him that if he was the last
[02:22:54] man in the world I would rather starve than work for him with that I left my heart pounding
[02:23:02] and a foul taste in my mouth I walked aimlessly through miles of streets wishing that I was
[02:23:07] back on some battlefield with real men soldiers like 18 platoon
[02:23:17] armistice day brings its problems pagan I would like to go to church we used to go but found
[02:23:25] almost without exception a lack of perception and sensitivity amongst the clergy
[02:23:30] we suffered one armistice day sir sermon devoted to the curates theory that war being a crime
[02:23:40] against humanity all chivalry must therefore be hypocritical I wondered whether the German
[02:23:49] stretcher bears and their wounded at sin drn would have agreed I took offense pagan I have a lot
[02:23:58] to mourn she jack weatherly and I 18 pltunes dead perhaps it is expecting too much of anyone to
[02:24:08] understand intense grief particularly that of an now aging platoon commander who had to lead some of his
[02:24:16] men to their deaths we now spend armistice day quietly at home with our ghosts
[02:24:34] memories abound during the night I made a habit of wandering around the platoon
[02:24:40] position so that each of my soldiers could talk to me I learned a lot they talked about their families
[02:24:47] and their future hopes I hardly had to contribute to those whispered conversations that some
[02:24:54] times took place in the dead of night or in the cold gray light just before dawn
[02:25:01] I think it may have helped my soldiers to have a confidant
[02:25:04] invaluable experience of human nature I now treasure the memory
[02:25:16] weapons also left memories the monotonous repetitive bursts of the brain the hysterical
[02:25:23] shriek of the mg 42's for furious rate of fire and the lethal chatter of the stands and schmysers all
[02:25:30] contribute all contributed to the cacophony of battle traceable it seared themselves into memory
[02:25:41] fired from a distance the parable approached almost lazily until suddenly like a swarm of fiery
[02:25:52] demons they accelerated directly past one's head with earspooling cracks I shall never forget the
[02:26:00] brain splitting shockwave as mortar bombs detonated nor the rending of the atmosphere when a stick
[02:26:06] of nebel war for bombs straddled one slit trench my memory is stocked with smells
[02:26:16] the metallic stench of dead cattle and Normandy the punching odor of German prisoners and the
[02:26:21] vial penetrating chemical smell from a newly plowed shell creator strange fleeting memories too
[02:26:34] why in circumstance of great danger did the palms of my hands moisten making it difficult to grip the
[02:26:41] butt of my pistol why on pitch black knights full of menace was it possible to discern enemy
[02:26:49] movement by fixing my straining eyes slightly to its side it sounds foolish but I swear that it works
[02:26:57] after 40 years I am sure I could still prime a 36 grenade in total darkness or load the
[02:27:02] magazines of a cult automatic pistol I remember our dead
[02:27:10] their souls departing they lay awkwardly like bundles of discarded clothing
[02:27:21] at bedberg lands corporal portius lay by their railway crossing
[02:27:27] in an instant he had gone leaving his body clothing and equipment
[02:27:33] empty
[02:27:34] at halvin boom private jones died with a tiny cry boston the chill winter air
[02:27:44] as the bullet took him from us
[02:27:52] memories are not all sad
[02:27:55] rarely since as my adrenaline flowed as an advance to combat
[02:28:00] with all the senses alert one lived for a few hours sometimes for day at a concert pitch
[02:28:10] like a drug it captivated me I wanted more totally absorbed one pressed on until objectives had been
[02:28:18] seized then I flopped as I had never done since
[02:28:23] I remember the mood of pulsating expectancy during the last few hours before battle
[02:28:31] old trusted friends like Dennis Clark and brandly handcock would arrive to tie up their artillery
[02:28:37] support others troop commanders from the Sherwood Rangers would appear almost in party mood
[02:28:43] demari up with us the very air was vibrant with excitement and good fellowship no
[02:28:49] acrimony simply an exercise and willing cooperation to help us the infantry over come the day's grim
[02:28:56] task
[02:29:02] but my most treasured memory is the simple and sincere affection which existed between us all
[02:29:13] based on mutual trust it was the cornerstone of the platoon success
[02:29:17] and it survives unchanged to this day this is changed with regret regret because
[02:29:26] Jim Kingston owned cheeseman and particularly Doug Proctor did not receive any
[02:29:31] recognition they so richly deserved
[02:29:36] Jim and Owen were mentioned dispatches but Doug was left unrewarded
[02:29:42] over the years this omission has troubled me particularly because I had not been
[02:29:47] so had I not been so young and inexperienced more notice might have been taken of my representations
[02:29:55] I have no doubt that they all learned a military metal on more than one occasion and I their
[02:30:01] platoon commander failed them in this respect
[02:30:04] I miss my soldiers the warmth of their presence comforted me and their humor restored my spirits
[02:30:19] in the brutal world of infantry warfare although few of them realized it and certainly none would admit it
[02:30:26] their behavior was noble their absence left avoid which but for an exceptionally happy marriage
[02:30:38] would have certainly drawn me back into the army for the comfort that only a soldier can
[02:30:45] understand strangely I have never since considered myself anything but a soldier
[02:30:57] and that wraps up that book and I'm not sure if I have much
[02:31:27] to add because
[02:31:37] because Sidney Jerry seems to capture it
[02:31:44] and so much of what he talks about
[02:31:49] explains
[02:31:50] so much not only about about being a soldier but also about what it's like
[02:32:02] when a soldier is no longer a soldier to
[02:32:10] to miss the adrenaline to miss that singular focus
[02:32:19] to miss seeing men at their best at their noblest
[02:32:40] to miss the men themselves
[02:32:43] your comrades your friends your brothers
[02:32:54] to miss what he calls so perfectly that simple and sincere affection that exists in a platoon
[02:33:05] in affection that I'm not sure exists anywhere else
[02:33:19] and you you hear me talk about when I start talking about a seal platoon
[02:33:25] about how that's the best thing in the world and Sidney Jerry captures it
[02:33:29] better than me you miss the mission and you miss the men
[02:33:40] and of course you miss the fallen
[02:33:47] as the British call them the glorious dead
[02:34:02] and you wonder what would have become of them
[02:34:07] where would they be now
[02:34:20] and you you wonder why
[02:34:27] why them
[02:34:27] why was it them
[02:34:40] and you know I talk about
[02:34:45] the gift right the gift that they gave us
[02:34:49] that the fallen have given us this gift of freedom and this gift of life but there's
[02:34:58] there's more
[02:35:04] there's more
[02:35:08] because you see
[02:35:13] the rest of us
[02:35:16] we grow old
[02:35:23] from time passes us by
[02:35:31] and that that simple and sincere affection that Sidney Jerry describes
[02:35:39] it changes
[02:35:40] as we change
[02:35:47] it ages
[02:35:52] as we age
[02:35:58] but the fallen do not change
[02:36:04] the fallen do not age time has no effect on them
[02:36:10] they remain
[02:36:15] they remain young and bold and brave and uncomfortable
[02:36:30] and so we remember them
[02:36:34] that way
[02:36:34] as they were and as they will always be
[02:36:49] are heroes
[02:36:55] heroes who walk no more and yet walk everywhere with us
[02:37:00] who smile no more and yet they never stop smiling
[02:37:12] heroes who live no more yet never stop living
[02:37:16] are friends who shine no more and yet never stop shining
[02:37:35] and that is the other gift that they give us
[02:37:54] the fortune
[02:37:56] to panic
[02:38:08] and remember
[02:38:12] I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[02:38:28] So echo, maybe if you could talk about something else for a little while.
[02:38:56] Yeah, I would appreciate it.
[02:39:00] A part that stood out and we talked about this before, where the Germans were attacking
[02:39:10] 150 yards away.
[02:39:12] They just get mowed down, they just keep killed.
[02:39:16] The red flag comes up.
[02:39:19] Structures come out.
[02:39:21] Everyone sees fires, they're following the specific rules.
[02:39:26] And then they collect the bodies and they salute.
[02:39:30] We're good and then he salutes back.
[02:39:34] Okay, solid.
[02:39:35] No, game on, essentially game on now.
[02:39:40] But this is like a war, though.
[02:39:41] You know, it's different.
[02:39:42] I mean, you kind of get that same feeling way on the lower level.
[02:39:45] Obviously, but you're watching a UFC fight and then the round ends.
[02:39:49] And then the guys kind of bump, bump, bump, like good round.
[02:39:52] For sure.
[02:39:53] So, well, two seconds ago, you guys were trying to knock the guy out, you know, just
[02:39:58] like in this situation.
[02:39:59] Two seconds ago, these guys were coming to kill you and you killed them, killed them.
[02:40:03] Yeah.
[02:40:04] Boom, it happened round over, you know, let's essentially continue following the rules.
[02:40:12] And it's weird because it's less about the rules and more about like the respect, you
[02:40:16] know?
[02:40:17] It is.
[02:40:18] And on top of that, you can pile on the fact that when they were in a hole in
[02:40:23] woods, the Germans had booby trapped the British body, so they were just laying there.
[02:40:29] They didn't get the same respect back.
[02:40:33] But I think that's one thing that Sydney Jerry is very intent on throughout the book
[02:40:39] is that regardless of how depraved the enemy acts, they are going to take the high road.
[02:40:48] And you know, I think that's why this book is, this book, they give this book to everyone
[02:40:52] at Sanhurst, which is the British military academy.
[02:40:57] They give us everyone.
[02:40:58] I mean, that's a great reason why because he sets a standard with his troops and they hold
[02:41:03] that standard through regardless of the way the enemy behaves.
[02:41:08] They don't lower themselves to that behavior.
[02:41:11] You know, the worst atrocity that gets committed by his soldiers is when they spank
[02:41:16] a waffen SS guy on the ass.
[02:41:18] Yeah.
[02:41:19] That's why this book is so powerful.
[02:41:24] And you know, there's a lot of the book is very, it's very, you know, there's stuff
[02:41:28] in there that you just aren't ready for, right?
[02:41:34] Even when he was talking about the traits that someone should have.
[02:41:37] And you know, when you start thinking about it, he's right.
[02:41:43] He's right.
[02:41:44] And if you had the choice between getting some meat head that was going to go do your
[02:41:48] bidding, even though he might look like a big beast.
[02:41:50] And he's going to, but then if you think about how's that guy going to act?
[02:41:53] When things get tough or when things become ethically challenging.
[02:41:58] Yeah.
[02:41:59] How's that person going to act?
[02:42:00] So these are, and it's, and I love the fact also that man, he's killing people.
[02:42:09] He's lead, you know, it's easy to get caught up in the fact that he's wearing Corbura
[02:42:13] Pants and he's got this.
[02:42:14] There's a part, there's another part.
[02:42:15] And didn't go over in the podcast, but there's a group of German, there's like German, some
[02:42:26] kind of artillery piece and an artillery team.
[02:42:30] And they're getting, the, the brits are getting their guns dialed in to the team.
[02:42:34] And they're going to start killing them.
[02:42:36] And they make a run for it.
[02:42:38] And they have horses.
[02:42:39] And there's like six guys and some horses towing this, this artillery piece away.
[02:42:44] And the city Jerry feels happy.
[02:42:47] He's happy that the, he's especially happy the horses, like, you know, he doesn't like
[02:42:50] seeing the, the, the animals get killed.
[02:42:54] And so he's actually happy that these guys escape.
[02:42:58] And then he just says, you know, well, that's wrong because these guys have been come back
[02:43:02] and killed my soldiers.
[02:43:04] So he does a, you can see how hard it is for someone to be in these situations where
[02:43:13] you have the good conscience, which wants to do the right thing.
[02:43:16] And at the same time, you got to kill people.
[02:43:19] Yeah.
[02:43:20] And that's what makes combat so hard.
[02:43:23] Yeah.
[02:43:24] And he didn't, can he get to thinking about, remember the Christmas, the Christmas.
[02:43:29] Christmas.
[02:43:30] Yeah.
[02:43:31] Yeah.
[02:43:32] Yeah.
[02:43:33] Christmas.
[02:43:34] Yeah.
[02:43:35] Where the Germans, the Germans kind of in that situation, they initiated that, right?
[02:43:37] They were, like, cause like a mutual initiation.
[02:43:40] But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you remember that particular story, but I think overall it
[02:43:43] was almost like a mutual initiation, but yes, in that particular story, there was sort of a
[02:43:47] voice that says, hey, yeah, okay.
[02:43:48] I don't cheat you, whatever.
[02:43:50] And yeah, man, it's just crazy how that can kind of emerge from these situations where
[02:43:57] guys are just straight up getting blown to pieces on purpose, by the way.
[02:44:01] Not, you know, not like some tragic accident.
[02:44:03] Like, this is that's the intent.
[02:44:04] That's the intention.
[02:44:06] And then they want to just stop and sing together, please soccer.
[02:44:11] And then the next day, by the way, they're going back to killing each other on mass.
[02:44:15] Yeah.
[02:44:16] Dang.
[02:44:17] Yeah, that's the thing about, you know, the, you know, this, a book like this is so
[02:44:23] revealing of human nature, because business people have to do the same thing.
[02:44:28] Yeah.
[02:44:29] You know, if you're a business person and your business is losing money, well, guess what
[02:44:34] you might have to do, cut staff.
[02:44:36] So if you got to, and you, you know, we, let's say we're working with a small business
[02:44:40] or you're, you've got a small business.
[02:44:42] You've got 20 people.
[02:44:43] You know all those 20 people.
[02:44:44] Yeah.
[02:44:45] But it's not like a nameless person that you're firing.
[02:44:48] When you let go for five people, because you need to save money next quarter, you're
[02:44:53] going to lose your building.
[02:44:54] Yeah.
[02:44:55] Guess what?
[02:44:56] You're going to know those people.
[02:44:57] Yeah.
[02:44:58] And so it's the same dichotomy where this boss who wants to take care of his people, just
[02:45:04] like Sydney Jerry wants to take care of his men and all of a sudden the only way to do
[02:45:08] your mission is you've got to, you've got to get some of these people killed, or you're
[02:45:11] going to fire some of these people.
[02:45:13] Otherwise our plant shuts down.
[02:45:14] Otherwise we can't go forward and everyone dies.
[02:45:17] No one has a job now.
[02:45:18] So the similarities, again, that's why it's, that's why these things about war reveal so much
[02:45:25] about human nature, which is really what this podcast is about, is about human nature.
[02:45:30] And the better you understand human nature, there's two things that can happen.
[02:45:33] Number one, the better you can lead other people, but equally as important, if not more
[02:45:38] important, is if you understand human nature, you can understand yourself.
[02:45:42] Yeah.
[02:45:43] You can understand the decisions that you make.
[02:45:44] You can understand why something's bothering you.
[02:45:46] You can understand what you need to conclude so that you can move forward in the best possible
[02:45:54] way.
[02:45:55] And if you don't understand human nature, you're, you're, in that, that's understanding
[02:45:59] yourself.
[02:46:00] Yeah.
[02:46:01] And these books allow you to gather and garner so much of that.
[02:46:05] Yeah.
[02:46:06] Yeah.
[02:46:07] Especially all the similarities.
[02:46:08] So many.
[02:46:09] All the time.
[02:46:11] I remember in, just not junior high.
[02:46:15] Yeah, I was junior high.
[02:46:17] Um, maybe early high school.
[02:46:19] So when I used to play pop Warner football, where my best friend played for a different
[02:46:25] team.
[02:46:26] But we're all, you know, it's in pop Warner.
[02:46:28] It's different.
[02:46:32] It's not by school.
[02:46:33] It's by like, Regent, you know, like, an up region.
[02:46:36] I guess town.
[02:46:37] I'm going to go in.
[02:46:38] I don't think.
[02:46:39] Anyway, so the, you know, my best friend at the time, his name was Byron.
[02:46:41] He, uh, who became a pilot, by the way.
[02:46:44] I think it's the arms.
[02:46:45] Yeah, I'm here.
[02:46:46] I'm here.
[02:46:47] I'm here.
[02:46:48] I'm here.
[02:46:49] Anyway, um, he played for a different team, but we were best friends.
[02:46:51] So it was kind of that thing, you know, where your friends with the guys, but then,
[02:46:55] you know, you go on the battlefield, you gather battling, you're back to friends.
[02:46:58] Yeah, you're not killing them, though.
[02:47:00] No way, different.
[02:47:01] Yeah, uh, and there's, did you ever see that in Iraq, like, any of that, like, I don't
[02:47:07] know, compassion, you know, yeah.
[02:47:09] Yeah, for sure.
[02:47:10] Even with the enemy type.
[02:47:11] We're not not so much with the enemy type.
[02:47:12] That's what I mean.
[02:47:13] But with the civilian types, for sure.
[02:47:16] I mean, I mean, obviously, and you'd see guys would go completely out of the way to try
[02:47:21] and protect the civilian.
[02:47:23] The enemy over there is a lot.
[02:47:26] It's different.
[02:47:27] Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's, you know, here you have a uniformed soldier.
[02:47:32] Yeah.
[02:47:33] You know, there you don't have a uniformed soldier.
[02:47:34] You got somebody that's trying to sneak around and, and bully up the 90.
[02:47:39] And yeah, you don't see that same level of now.
[02:47:44] Uh, I mean, once you get a guy captured, that's it.
[02:47:48] You know, okay.
[02:47:49] We got him captured.
[02:47:50] Zip them up, put him in the back of the home V.
[02:47:51] I mean, that's it.
[02:47:53] Yeah.
[02:47:54] So you definitely, what what he talks about is this mutual respect of like look, we're
[02:48:03] sitting in a slit trench getting murdered.
[02:48:06] And when I, like when I meet you, you're on the other side, but I know that you've been
[02:48:10] slitting him that sitting in a slit trench getting murdered all day.
[02:48:12] Right.
[02:48:13] That's why we have mutual respect for each other.
[02:48:15] Yeah.
[02:48:16] In Iraq, it's asymmetrical warfare.
[02:48:18] So they're not suffering the same type of situation.
[02:48:23] And they also, you know, one thing that really throws that stuff out the window is the
[02:48:28] way that the insurgents treated the civilian populace.
[02:48:31] Yeah.
[02:48:32] So we're witnessing nonjudicial murders like when executions, we're seeing that.
[02:48:40] We're seeing civilians getting tortured.
[02:48:42] We're seeing, you know, people being beheaded.
[02:48:46] And so when you see that, you're there trying to help these people.
[02:48:49] And you start to think, look, if you're another infantryman in an opposing army, I can
[02:48:56] I can empathize with you.
[02:48:57] I can understand what you're going through.
[02:48:59] But if you're, even if you're another army, but I see you raping torturing, murdering,
[02:49:06] burning people alive, I don't empathize with you anymore.
[02:49:09] It doesn't work that way.
[02:49:11] So not really.
[02:49:13] Yeah.
[02:49:14] Now, you would get occasionally you'd get, like you could tell that someone would be mixed
[02:49:19] up in something that they shouldn't have been mixed up in.
[02:49:22] And maybe a young kid, you know, maybe a 17, 18 year old, because some of those kids,
[02:49:27] some of the insurgents were not vehemently, you know, pro al-Qaeda.
[02:49:36] Some of them were just, hey, look, I'm going to get paid 50 bucks to put an ID in the
[02:49:39] road.
[02:49:40] Yeah. And if you paid me 50 bucks to go and plant, you know, crop over there, I just
[02:49:46] assumed to do that.
[02:49:47] Yeah.
[02:49:48] So you'd see some of that.
[02:49:49] There'd be, okay, look, this kid's just, you know, he'd just caught up in something
[02:49:53] doesn't understand.
[02:49:54] And then again, I mean, all, again, the dichotomy is if you're putting an ID in the
[02:49:59] road to kill Americans, but I don't care about you.
[02:50:01] And I want to kill you.
[02:50:05] That's all there is to that.
[02:50:06] And, but it's definitely a different scenario when the people that you're fighting are,
[02:50:13] are the ones that are committing these kinds of atrocities.
[02:50:17] Because even as these guys, you know, they, you see how he differentiated between, like,
[02:50:21] the Waffen SS and like a normal infantry group, he differentiates those two.
[02:50:26] That'd be like if, let's say, the war in Iraq was against, let's say, Al Qaeda had taken
[02:50:31] over Iraq and you were fighting, given the hardened al Qaeda guys or some normal infantry
[02:50:37] men from the Iraqi army.
[02:50:38] Yeah, those guys, you'd been like, hey, look, this dude's surrender to, okay, the al Qaeda
[02:50:43] guys, first of all, they're probably not going to surrender.
[02:50:46] And if they do, that's, they're going to not get the same treatment that a guy that's
[02:50:51] a victim of circumstance, right?
[02:50:53] A lot of the Germans, they're victim of circumstance.
[02:50:56] Hey, that, this guy came into power.
[02:50:59] I was a soldier.
[02:51:00] I'm still a soldier.
[02:51:01] You know, and, man, it's heavy.
[02:51:07] It is.
[02:51:08] But there is definitely a mutual respect that you have for another servicemen that's, you
[02:51:16] know, has been through the same kind of crap that you've been through.
[02:51:18] Yeah.
[02:51:19] Yeah, man, make sense.
[02:51:22] So with that, speaking of heavy, lifting kettlebells.
[02:51:26] Anyway, I feel like we should talk about on it on a great kettlebells.
[02:51:32] Again, I do feel spoiled, even every time I pick a month, even though they're dope, you
[02:51:36] know, the artistic ones, should we call them artistic?
[02:51:41] No.
[02:51:42] Because they have names, right?
[02:51:43] Primal bells.
[02:51:44] Yeah, just called that better than or legend bells.
[02:51:46] All that stuff, you know, I feel kind of spoiled because they're kind of like the designer
[02:51:51] ones.
[02:51:52] They're designer-ish, balanced by the way.
[02:51:55] You know, we got into that.
[02:51:59] Here's the thing about the guy, and I said this before, starting light with kettlebells.
[02:52:05] It's critical.
[02:52:06] My friend Anthony came over.
[02:52:07] I don't know if you remember Anthony.
[02:52:09] No.
[02:52:10] The first day we recorded he was at my house.
[02:52:13] Oh, yeah.
[02:52:14] Yeah.
[02:52:15] So he came over the other day and he was like, yeah, let's lift and, you know, last
[02:52:18] time I seen him, I wasn't so much into the kettlebells.
[02:52:20] So I was like, all right, we're doing this thing.
[02:52:22] Be careful.
[02:52:23] And I saw him.
[02:52:24] He never done it.
[02:52:25] Did you hurt him?
[02:52:26] No, but-
[02:52:27] Oh, he just he grabbed the lightest one and, you know, I said, start light or whatever.
[02:52:31] And you could tell his, I'm gonna say this with all due respect if you haven't done
[02:52:35] it before.
[02:52:37] It makes sense.
[02:52:38] But like his form was way off and I'm thinking bro, you're gonna get hurt.
[02:52:41] Yeah.
[02:52:42] You know?
[02:52:43] Yeah.
[02:52:44] So I was gonna go into like what crazy workout I did, but I'll save that for another
[02:52:47] time.
[02:52:48] For now.
[02:52:49] We're almost at three hours right now.
[02:52:50] For now.
[02:52:51] I just looked at my watch.
[02:52:52] 253.
[02:52:53] That's not a good sign.
[02:52:56] So I apologize to everyone in the world for doing a three and a half hour podcast,
[02:53:00] which is gonna turn into a faculty who describes his last 14 workouts.
[02:53:03] Four and a half hours.
[02:53:05] Great detail.
[02:53:06] Nonetheless, so we'll, uh, create a real quick.
[02:53:10] I was talking to somebody at the mustard.
[02:53:13] I think he was, I forget who it was.
[02:53:15] Nonetheless, we was talking about the benefits yet again.
[02:53:17] This is like a common thing.
[02:53:19] It's true.
[02:53:20] I don't exaggerate about the cruel oil.
[02:53:22] It's something like I can't go back to not taking cruel oil.
[02:53:25] No, take the cruel oil.
[02:53:26] And I don't mind.
[02:53:27] Oh, actually, we were talking to the left.
[02:53:29] Remember the life city you ran out of cruel oil?
[02:53:31] Yeah, and he's all mad at me because he gave me some.
[02:53:33] Oh, you're kidding.
[02:53:35] I didn't bring any.
[02:53:36] Yeah, actually technically technically was a channel that he brought me some.
[02:53:39] I think he just gave you one.
[02:53:40] None the less.
[02:53:41] He gave me one.
[02:53:42] Yeah, so I guess he can have a part of it.
[02:53:45] Got the credit.
[02:53:45] Nope.
[02:53:46] Nonetheless, I'll never go back to no cruel oil.
[02:53:49] So where would you get it?
[02:53:50] On it, cruel oil.
[02:53:51] What if you wanted to save money?
[02:53:53] Go on it.com slash chocolate.

[02:54:03] anything you need supplementation with, all the way down to workouts.
[02:54:08] They got it on there.

[02:54:14] Very really funny.
[02:54:15] First, and that has that issue.
[02:54:16] I don't think so.
[02:54:17] I will guarantee you all spend time watching the videos and stuff.
[02:54:21] Browsing the products.
[02:54:24] Sometimes you can get like, we talked about the, you know, how you get on Amazon.
[02:54:28] And you're like, yeah, I want to get that thing too.
[02:54:30] You don't really need it.
[02:54:31] Just look super cool.
[02:54:32] It's one of those.
[02:54:33] Amazon does that.
[02:54:34] Yeah, so be careful.
[02:54:36] It does.
[02:54:37] But I don't think it like prompts you.
[02:54:38] It's just the list of stuff is all cool.
[02:54:40] You know, it's not just a kettlebell.
[02:54:42] It's the really cool one.
[02:54:43] You know, so it's that situation.
[02:54:45] Anyway, on it.com slash chocolate, if you want the 10% off.
[02:54:49] And yeah, report back.

[02:54:55] I'll tell you till the end of time.
[02:54:56] I will not take krill oil ever again.
[02:55:00] If I have anything to say about it.
[02:55:02] Another way to support is when you pick up your copy of 18
[02:55:07] platoon or whichever books you choose that chocolate reads on this podcast.

[02:55:33] Whoever you are listening to this, you can also get it from a website.
[02:55:39] Riflesdirect.com, which actually supports the rifles regimen in the UK.
[02:55:44] So you can get it there as well.
[02:55:47] Or you can buy the used hardcover copies from Amazon.com after you click through.
[02:55:54] Yeah, click through there, boom.
[02:55:56] And even if you're buying something else, hey, click through.

[02:56:03] Another way.
[02:56:05] Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, and any other podcast providing
[02:56:13] platforms also and not excluding YouTube.
[02:56:19] YouTube's a good one.
[02:56:20] Video version.
[02:56:21] I got YouTube read by the way.
[02:56:23] Okay, wait, wait, what's the benefit?
[02:56:24] So the one of the benefits is on YouTube, Brad, you can listen to, even if you go to another
[02:56:29] app, all right, yeah.
[02:56:30] Right, yeah.
[02:56:31] So it's a real, it's a real cool deal for me.
[02:56:34] Yeah, I'm in.
[02:56:35] It's real hands.
[02:56:37] I like that.
[02:56:38] Yeah, I know you do.
[02:56:39] Good.
[02:56:40] relevant.
[02:56:41] Most of the time.
[02:56:42] It's the same ad over and over and over and it gets, you know what, though, you
[02:56:45] know when they play, you ever see the same.
[02:56:47] Well, you don't see ads anymore.
[02:56:48] No, but there's a lot of people who may or may not enjoy ads and or still have the only
[02:56:54] person that enjoy ads.
[02:56:55] You got this.
[02:56:56] You got this.
[02:56:57] You know, you know, how's it like here, for example.
[02:57:01] So Thai Lopez, right?
[02:57:03] That's not it.
[02:57:04] I don't know.
[02:57:05] They all have like, I had every single time.
[02:57:07] Yeah, I know.
[02:57:08] You know, there's this other financial company, which is a weird one, which is, it's
[02:57:11] a really poorly done nonetheless.
[02:57:13] So Thai Lopez, here's the example, Thai Lopez, he'll be like, they'll talk about some
[02:57:17] stuff.
[02:57:18] And then after it's the same ad over and over and after a while, you're like, okay, okay, skip
[02:57:22] the ad.
[02:57:23] But then it kind of sticks with you and then you're kind of like, yeah, that's called advertising.
[02:57:26] I know.
[02:57:27] I know that's what I mean.
[02:57:28] Yeah, but it's kind of like, I see what's going on yet.
[02:57:31] I still am compelled, you know?
[02:57:32] So it's like, it's kind of like, it's beneficial almost.
[02:57:35] I'm over here, not compelled.
[02:57:36] It's not compelled.
[02:57:37] No.
[02:57:38] But I am compelled to subscribe to YouTube.
[02:57:43] Yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:57:44] There you go.
[02:57:45] So you're trying to say, you're saying a lot of other stuff right now.
[02:57:48] Well, you know, it's not helpful.
[02:57:49] I'm going to these tangents and it's relevant.
[02:57:51] I feel like people can relate on some level, sometimes.
[02:57:56] Maybe.
[02:57:57] Occasionally.
[02:57:58] Weird people.
[02:57:59] Nonetheless, YouTube, that's a good one.
[02:58:01] Video version.
[02:58:02] What's the, what's Jockel podcast is the channel?
[02:58:05] Yeah.
[02:58:06] To subscribe to.
[02:58:07] Yeah.
[02:58:08] It'd be cool if you put videos on there more often.
[02:58:10] I do stuff like two, three a week.
[02:58:12] Oh, yeah, two, three a week now.
[02:58:14] Kind of.
[02:58:15] Okay, good.
[02:58:16] I'm looking forward to that new.
[02:58:17] Whatever I put, I put one on the other, what is Monday?
[02:58:20] Yeah, okay, that's one.
[02:58:22] It's, it's whatever it is right now.
[02:58:24] Yeah, man.
[02:58:25] Thursday.
[02:58:26] No worries.
[02:58:27] I got you.
[02:58:28] Go subscribe to that if you haven't already.
[02:58:30] And you can get the video version and excerpts, which are shareable, shareable, meaning
[02:58:35] they're just shorter.
[02:58:37] They're shorter.
[02:58:38] So, you know, whoever opens it, they're going to be, then more of a chance they're going
[02:58:42] to listen to it when it's two, three minutes longer than two and a half, three and a half
[02:58:46] in this case hours long.
[02:58:49] That's just how.
[02:58:50] That's not fired from doing podcasts because they're too long.
[02:58:53] Is that possible?
[02:58:54] Maybe.
[02:58:55] I guess how they do it.
[02:58:57] What else?
[02:58:58] Anything is possible, right?
[02:58:59] That's the thing.
[02:59:00] What else?
[02:59:01] Jockel has a store.
[02:59:02] It's called Jockel Store.
[02:59:05] It's a site jockelstore.com.
[02:59:07] See, catchy, right?
[02:59:09] Easy to remember.
[02:59:10] If it's a store and it's jockels is jockel store.
[02:59:13] If it's a podcast and it's jockels is jockel podcast.
[02:59:16] If it's, you know, if it's key chains.
[02:59:19] I was meeting some people.
[02:59:20] Jockel key chains.
[02:59:21] I was meeting some people talking to some people at a group the other day who are not familiar
[02:59:27] with me or with anything.
[02:59:29] Got to respect.
[02:59:31] And they said, oh, well, do you, do you, or, you know, one of them said, oh, he's got a podcast.
[02:59:38] And then the other one said, oh, what's the name of the podcast?
[02:59:40] That's what all the podcasts he's called Jockel Podcast.
[02:59:44] And she said, this one, cross it.
[02:59:47] Did you pay your marketing team a lot for that?
[02:59:50] Yeah.
[02:59:51] And I said, yes, and the fact I did.
[02:59:53] You know, exactly.
[02:59:55] Real original like that.
[02:59:56] Yep.
[02:59:57] So original, but hey, man.
[02:59:58] You know, could be worse.
[03:00:00] So back to the store.
[03:00:03] Jockel store, that is.
[03:00:04] There's some t-shirts on there.
[03:00:06] If you want to represent, you know, the t-shirts carry a message.
[03:00:09] The message has layers.
[03:00:12] Actually, I guess technically the shirts have layers because the message is one of the
[03:00:16] layers of the shirt.
[03:00:17] You know what I mean?
[03:00:18] Anyway, go on there.
[03:00:19] Jockelstore.com.
[03:00:20] If you like something, get something.
[03:00:21] That's a good way to start.
[03:00:22] Our shirts coming out this week.
[03:00:24] That's my question to you.
[03:00:25] Yeah, that's the intention.
[03:00:26] Okay, so I'm getting angry.
[03:00:28] Yeah, I understand.
[03:00:29] But you know, make me not get in your business.
[03:00:32] Hey, normal face.
[03:00:33] Normal face.
[03:00:34] Normal face.
[03:00:35] My face is way normal.
[03:00:36] But don't make me come and get in your business and do your job for you.
[03:00:38] Because if you've ever heard me talk on this podcast, I talk about when people don't do their job.
[03:00:42] That's awesome.
[03:00:43] Because then I can take their job from them.
[03:00:44] Right, right.
[03:00:45] You got to step down.
[03:00:46] Think about where I'm more of my mindset is.
[03:00:47] And you may want to step it up over on your end.
[03:00:49] Oh, thank you.
[03:00:50] But to jump into the store.
[03:00:51] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:00:53] No, no respect.
[03:00:54] I did it.
[03:00:56] And we're going to try to get that to do.
[03:00:57] Yeah, let's try it for you.
[03:00:59] No, let's do.
[03:01:01] You know why you're saying this right now because you can't wait for the shirt that you designed to come up.
[03:01:07] Because you want the recognition.
[03:01:08] Well, I also think your I think you might be sabotaging and sabotaging my efforts.
[03:01:16] I made the better shirt.
[03:01:18] And you don't want to print it because your self-conscious.
[03:01:24] And that's not going to stand.
[03:01:26] Well, I will give you the respect because there is in fact layers to this shirt as well.
[03:01:30] So all right, how about this more layers more layers.
[03:01:33] Oh, yeah, yeah, you could be right.
[03:01:35] I think you might have more layers than the standard.
[03:01:38] I guess we'll see.
[03:01:40] We're going to find out about that one.
[03:01:41] Anyway, jockels.com.
[03:01:42] So women's stuff on there as well.
[03:01:43] Some patches, some rash guards, some cool rash guards.
[03:01:47] Yeah.
[03:01:48] Indeed.
[03:01:49] Some huddies.
[03:01:50] Other stuff.
[03:01:51] Anyway, go on there.
[03:01:52] Check it out.
[03:01:53] If you want something, get something.
[03:01:54] Also, psychological warfare.
[03:01:56] If you're having trouble.
[03:01:58] If you're having trouble.
[03:02:00] If you're like me and sometimes you do or currently having trouble with not feeling like working out.
[03:02:07] Not feeling like it.
[03:02:09] So you're considering skipping the workout, waiting for tomorrow, making your workout day into a rest day.
[03:02:16] If you're having that problem, this is what you do.
[03:02:18] Psychological warfare search on iTunes.
[03:02:21] Google Boy.
[03:02:22] Amazon.
[03:02:23] So anyway, where you can get MP3s, you search psychological warfare.
[03:02:26] Jockel willink.
[03:02:29] And it's an album.
[03:02:32] Witcher.
[03:02:33] And these tracks will help you through anything that you're feeling that weakness, like I just mentioned,
[03:02:39] whether it be waking up early or skipping the workout or cheating on the diet.
[03:02:43] And I say cheating on the diet.
[03:02:45] Because you made a promise to yourself, you're not going to eat those donuts.
[03:02:48] You made a promise.
[03:02:49] And then now like all of us on all of them.
[03:02:51] Eat the donuts.
[03:02:52] No, that's not the promise you made.
[03:02:54] Just think I can never eat a donut again.
[03:02:56] No, sure.
[03:02:57] Exactly right.
[03:02:58] Because everyone in the world will, like, somewhat, be there with a camera.
[03:03:02] Yeah.
[03:03:03] And they'll get me a pop at the end.
[03:03:05] Yeah, yeah, pop at the end.
[03:03:06] And consider this, like, what if you knew 100% know once, you know, watch whatever.
[03:03:11] And then you're eating the donut.
[03:03:12] Can you imagine the guilt?
[03:03:13] Yeah.
[03:03:14] You're feeling like you're a guilt.
[03:03:15] Yeah, you can do it.
[03:03:16] You're done.
[03:03:17] Don't let the time.
[03:03:18] You know, but in the event of other people, not you do other people feeling that weakness.
[03:03:24] There's a track for that.
[03:03:25] Remember back when I phone kind of came out and there's that thing.
[03:03:31] There's an app for that.
[03:03:32] Remember that you always say that.
[03:03:34] Oh, there's an app for that.
[03:03:35] There's an app for that.
[03:03:36] That was like an expression.
[03:03:37] Okay.
[03:03:38] Look, with this, there's a track for that.
[03:03:40] You just made that up right now.
[03:03:43] Anyway, psychological warfare.
[03:03:44] You check it.
[03:03:45] If you need that.
[03:03:46] If you need that, that's spot.
[03:03:49] Because really, that's what it is.
[03:03:50] It's a spot in life.
[03:03:52] When you're trying to live heavy things, it's good to have a spot.
[03:03:55] If you're living light stuff or not lifting that all you need a spot.
[03:03:58] So don't even worry about that.
[03:04:00] If you're not doing nothing, don't even get this.
[03:04:01] You don't even need it.
[03:04:02] If you're not doing anything in life, don't get it.
[03:04:05] You shouldn't say.
[03:04:06] Yeah.
[03:04:07] Let's try.
[03:04:07] Let's try.
[03:04:08] Get it.
[03:04:08] Check.
[03:04:09] All right.
[03:04:10] Like I said, 18, we'll tune.
[03:04:11] You can get that at riflesdirect.com from the UK.
[03:04:13] It supports that regimen, which I'm all about.
[03:04:15] Also, you know, speaking of rash guards and stuff, check out originmain.com.
[03:04:20] My boy up there Pete Roberts, he's kind of a, he's kind of a psycho.
[03:04:26] Actually, kind of a madman.
[03:04:29] He's all about manufacturing in America, which I'm all about to.
[03:04:32] And I'm going to go into this at some point, but like you wanted to make guise here.
[03:04:37] And you couldn't get the fabric.
[03:04:38] So he went out and bought old abandoned looms from abandoned factories.
[03:04:42] And hired old timers that knew how to work these things and refer to them and rebuilt them.
[03:04:48] And has made these looms brought them back to life so they can make guise and rash guards.
[03:04:53] Here in America, in Maine.
[03:04:55] And like I said, that's kind of crazy borderline psychopathic, which I kind of like.
[03:05:02] And yeah, that's kind of why we're kind of working on joining forces in some way.
[03:05:08] Pete origin, warpath.
[03:05:13] It's going down.
[03:05:15] We're going to make something happen.
[03:05:16] I'll keep everyone informed as we finalize the plan.
[03:05:20] That rash guard that you mentioned.
[03:05:22] Yeah.
[03:05:23] And posted the video.
[03:05:25] Yeah.
[03:05:26] That was a lot nicer.
[03:05:27] Is a lot nicer in legit than I am.
[03:05:30] Yes, when you see it, it's underplayed.
[03:05:32] You're like, yeah, well, you didn't know.
[03:05:34] I made it sound like just kind of cheesy.
[03:05:37] Yeah, like you.
[03:05:38] But you didn't realize it was actually savvy.
[03:05:42] But the thing is that rash guard, it's already sold out.
[03:05:47] You know, so now he's printing a bunch more, but he's got to weave the material.
[03:05:53] Yeah, right?
[03:05:54] Or he gets, he gets one of his producers here in America.
[03:05:57] We submit to real so anyways.
[03:05:58] Check out that origin main dot com growing company.
[03:06:03] We're getting in league with them.
[03:06:05] And we're getting a big time.
[03:06:07] Also, jocquait on Amazon.
[03:06:10] Here's an actual, again, this is a certified verified report.
[03:06:16] I have a cat that used to catch one or two mice per month.
[03:06:20] I forgot to pick up a tea bag after I brewed it.
[03:06:23] And the cat ate the tea bag.
[03:06:25] Now my cat is bringing home raccoons, full grown rabbits, and even the neighbors dog.
[03:06:30] So be careful.
[03:06:31] Don't let your cat get it unless your neighbor's dog has been annoying.
[03:06:34] No, that's jocquait.
[03:06:36] You can have it.
[03:06:37] And it's not, doesn't take, the thing is doesn't taste like normal tea.
[03:06:40] You taste like victory.
[03:06:42] All right.
[03:06:43] Way the warrior kid boom.
[03:06:46] Also, this is a warning about way the warrior kid.
[03:06:48] When you order way the warrior kid, just go ahead and also order a pull-up bar.
[03:06:54] Some flashcards, some healthy food, and a jiu-jitsu geek.
[03:06:58] Because when your kid gets done reading this factually, they're going to want to be stronger, better, tougher.
[03:07:03] And smarter.
[03:07:04] So supply them the way they need to be supplied, quit playing around, get some.
[03:07:11] Also, the discipline equals freedom field manual.
[03:07:16] There's no book like this.
[03:07:18] Doesn't exist.
[03:07:19] It is not a normal book.
[03:07:22] It's kind of like the podcast.
[03:07:24] This podcast is not for everyone.
[03:07:27] Not everyone wants to listen to this podcast.
[03:07:30] That's okay.
[03:07:31] I'm not making a podcast for everyone.
[03:07:34] We're making a podcast for people that like to get after it.
[03:07:39] So this book is not for people that want to read junk.
[03:07:47] Some people don't get the podcast.
[03:07:49] Some people aren't going to understand the book.
[03:07:51] They're not going to know where it's coming from.
[03:07:53] That's okay.
[03:07:55] I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not toning down the podcast.
[03:08:00] We're not saying, oh, you know what?
[03:08:03] I think everyone would like it more if we did more, you know, interspersed some jokes throughout it.
[03:08:08] And maybe if we made it a 45 minutes and do a little fun presentation and I get some back up music.
[03:08:14] Just to kind of a little jangle to make people get in the spirit.
[03:08:17] We're not doing that.
[03:08:20] Not happening.
[03:08:21] Yeah.
[03:08:22] If you want to listen to a little jangle or a little, you know, metallic riff to get you in the zone on the beginning of the podcast.
[03:08:29] That's cool.
[03:08:30] If you want that, that's awesome.
[03:08:31] There's other podcasts that offer it.
[03:08:32] We don't offer it here.
[03:08:33] You know what you're going to get with the book.
[03:08:36] If you're looking for a, you know, 50 shades of gray, you're not going to get that.
[03:08:44] But that's the cool thing.
[03:08:45] The cool thing is that the publisher let me do whatever I wanted to do.
[03:08:50] So I did.
[03:08:51] And I made the feeling, you're going to feel that the feeling of the podcast.
[03:08:58] The feeling of the podcast is the same feeling that the book gets you.
[03:09:05] So it's.
[03:09:07] Little heavy.
[03:09:09] Little dark, right?
[03:09:11] Sparse, right?
[03:09:12] Sure.
[03:09:13] Get after it.
[03:09:14] That's in there.
[03:09:15] Anyways, this political field freedom field manual.

[03:09:24] It's not printed on white paper.
[03:09:27] So the straight up, let's just go from there.
[03:09:30] It's actually printed.
[03:09:32] The background is all images.
[03:09:37] Black and white images.
[03:09:39] I know that comes as a picture.
[03:09:40] Brace everyone.
[03:09:41] Sure.
[03:09:42] And then put over that is words.
[03:09:44] So there you go.

[03:09:52] It's a little book.
[03:09:53] It's about leadership.
[03:09:54] Actually it's about combat leadership.

[03:10:02] and climb to your life.

[03:10:36] If you want that.
[03:10:38] Also the monster we just got back from the Austin monster.
[03:10:42] Outstanding.
[03:10:43] Outstanding.
[03:10:44] It was awesome.
[03:10:45] So many great people in there.
[03:10:47] Lessons learned knowledge spread.
[03:10:50] Tim Kennedy was there.
[03:10:53] Tim Kennedy showed up.
[03:10:55] And it was cool.
[03:10:57] And I didn't realize it until we were at Gitu.
[03:11:01] And I think I came up to you and said this during Gitu.
[03:11:04] So the last night we had Thursday.
[03:11:06] Then Friday and the Friday night we go to Gitu.
[03:11:08] We went to 10th planet at Austin.
[03:11:11] Austin 10th planet.
[03:11:12] Gitu with my boy Curtis.
[03:11:14] Todd White was there.
[03:11:16] And Todd White was staying.
[03:11:17] Who represent?
[03:11:18] Yeah, he's an old school.
[03:11:20] He's me and him are from the same era.
[03:11:23] Yeah.
[03:11:24] We're from the same era from back in the day.
[03:11:28] Only he's a better artist.
[03:11:30] A better artist in me.
[03:11:32] So what we went and what I realized is this.
[03:11:37] You know like way the warrior kid.
[03:11:40] People say, oh man, I wish I had that book when I was a kid.
[03:11:43] An extreme ownership.
[03:11:44] People say, oh man, I wish I had that book when I started out.
[03:11:48] And when I got promoted five years ago.
[03:11:51] And you know what I say about way the warrior kid?
[03:11:53] I wish I had it when I was a kid.
[03:11:55] You know what I say about extreme ownership?
[03:11:57] I wish I had it when I was a assistant,
[03:12:00] a student, a student, a commuter.
[03:12:01] I wish I had it.
[03:12:02] I didn't have it.
[03:12:03] And what's cool about the monster is.
[03:12:05] So that feeling when you go to the monster,
[03:12:07] you're giving just like we're just giving this massive amount of information.
[03:12:12] Pragmatic information that you can take and you can execute with.
[03:12:17] And so when we were at GJitsu, I realized man, we just all this.
[03:12:22] These people in this room just got all this information.
[03:12:26] And it and it's so practical that you can take back your team.
[03:12:30] And then on top of all that, here's a little something else.
[03:12:32] GJitsu.
[03:12:33] Yeah.
[03:12:34] Because only one quarter of the people that came to GJitsu had ever trained GJitsu before.
[03:12:40] Yeah.
[03:12:41] The other was a 50 people that had never trained before.
[03:12:45] So they're getting this gift, the gift of GJitsu.
[03:12:48] The little angel.
[03:12:49] Yeah.
[03:12:50] Little angel now.
[03:12:51] I would say 50% of them will go back and start training.
[03:12:54] Yeah.
[03:12:55] Maybe more.
[03:12:56] I wish it was 100%.
[03:12:57] Yeah, it might be.
[03:12:58] Yeah.
[03:12:59] It'd be a depends on what you're into.
[03:13:01] Yeah.
[03:13:02] It's hard.
[03:13:03] It was always bizarre to me that when I introduced someone to GJitsu.
[03:13:06] It was a 100%.
[03:13:07] It was a 100%.
[03:13:08] I don't know.
[03:13:09] It's a 100% conversion rate.
[03:13:10] Yeah.
[03:13:11] 100%.
[03:13:12] Oh, you just chokes me and I couldn't stop you.
[03:13:14] I didn't even learn that 100%.
[03:13:15] Otherwise, I go through life vulnerable to being choked by anyone.
[03:13:18] I don't like that feeling.
[03:13:19] Yeah.
[03:13:20] No, I don't like that feeling.
[03:13:22] The mustard too is sprinkled and I mean, heart sprinkle hard, by the way, which is a very critical
[03:13:28] compelling part.
[03:13:29] In my opinion, is this social stuff.
[03:13:31] And I don't mean social like you're just cruising and not learning.
[03:13:34] I mean, the people you meet.
[03:13:36] Oh, yeah.
[03:13:37] Well, you definitely are going to meet good people there because everyone there is in the game
[03:13:41] big dime.
[03:13:42] And they're all looking to get better.
[03:13:43] They're all invested to get better.
[03:13:45] And the other thing is, you know, we're hanging out.
[03:13:49] I said, I mean, yeah, yeah, no, there's me,
[03:13:52] Lave, Dave, J.P. Echo.
[03:13:54] We're not.
[03:13:55] There's no green room.
[03:13:56] It doesn't exist.
[03:13:57] We don't even take breaks.
[03:13:58] Just like when we take a break to let the audience like go to the restaurant or grab a, you know, a cup of coffee or a
[03:14:08] chocolate tea, we just, we just stand there. Like we step down off of stage and we get everything lines up.
[03:14:15] We talk questions and you know what I was doing this time was I was like, instead of answering one person's question just to that person.
[03:14:21] I was in a room.
[03:14:22] Because he's asking the question, everyone coming here is near anybody.
[03:14:25] Hey, there's there's 12 people standing in line.
[03:14:28] Yeah.
[03:14:29] And instead of answering this one question, this one guy was bring no.
[03:14:32] Hey, everyone come up here.
[03:14:33] Come on up here.
[03:14:34] Yeah.
[03:14:34] And you can all hear this because what's your who knows?
[03:14:36] Maybe those are some of those questions. Maybe it's something you're going to experience in the future. I don't know.
[03:14:39] But you might as well listen and maybe you have a better solution than I have.
[03:14:43] Yeah. So it's like a like a little.
[03:14:45] A little break down table. Yeah.
[03:14:46] Break down.
[03:14:47] Yeah.
[03:14:48] Yeah.
[03:14:48] It's cool.
[03:14:49] That's true.
[03:14:50] You.
[03:14:50] We take breaks.
[03:14:51] Everyone, there's breaks throughout the thing.
[03:14:53] You take breaks.
[03:14:54] Yeah.
[03:14:54] Jock on.
[03:14:55] Don't take breaks.
[03:14:56] Because break time is talk time.
[03:14:58] It's talk time.
[03:14:59] You guys.
[03:14:59] You're a little slow.
[03:15:00] Yeah.
[03:15:00] Yeah.
[03:15:01] Sign a book.
[03:15:02] Whatever.
[03:15:03] Yeah.
[03:15:04] No green room.
[03:15:05] No green room.
[03:15:05] So that's the master.
[03:15:07] And by the way, they've sold out all of them that we've done have been sold out.
[03:15:13] Now the next one that we got coming up is September 14th and 15th back the Omni hotel in downtown San Diego, California,
[03:15:19] Master Zero Zero Four.
[03:15:20] It's gonna sell out.
[03:15:22] This is a known fact.
[03:15:23] So if you want to come, it's September 14th and 15th, that is right around the corner.
[03:15:28] Yeah.
[03:15:29] So if you want to come to that, come to that.
[03:15:32] Extremeownership.com is where you can register if you want to.
[03:15:36] Also, by the way, this is interesting.
[03:15:38] If you train you Jitsu or if you're interested in training Jitsu,
[03:15:42] or you're interested in training Jitsu,
[03:15:44] Origin, up in Maine has this immersion camp that they do.
[03:15:50] I'm going.
[03:15:52] Echo's going with me.
[03:15:54] We're going up there.
[03:15:56] It is.
[03:15:57] There's two sessions that they run.
[03:15:59] It's the 20th August, 20th, the 23rd or August 24th through the 27th.
[03:16:04] Those are the two different sessions.
[03:16:05] Or you can come for the whole week.
[03:16:07] Anyways, I'm going to be there for those middle three days.
[03:16:11] Like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[03:16:12] So I'm going to be there for the last day of the first camp on the first day of the
[03:16:16] lot of the second camp.
[03:16:18] And I'll be on there on the middle day.
[03:16:20] We're going to be training rolling, talking, hanging out, eating lobster, eating
[03:16:24] steaks, just generally getting after it.
[03:16:27] So you're going to origin Maine.com.
[03:16:30] If you want to come up, there's not a lot of spaces for that.
[03:16:33] It's not that's like I think the most they're going to go is 200 people.
[03:16:39] So that's not a lot of spaces.
[03:16:42] So if you want to come up, register quick.
[03:16:45] And I'll see you guys up there in Maine.
[03:16:47] What I like about it is, unlike the monster, where everything is scheduled,
[03:16:52] like we don't have a lot of break time.
[03:16:54] And even the break time is working.
[03:16:56] This thing, I mean, you can only train you, Jitsu.
[03:16:59] What?
[03:17:00] Six hours a day, maybe?
[03:17:01] 10, probably.
[03:17:02] You know what I mean?
[03:17:03] Two hours in the morning, two hours at lunch, two hours in the evening.
[03:17:06] So that's six hours.
[03:17:08] You're going to sleep four hours.
[03:17:09] So you still got 14 hours left in the day.
[03:17:11] So what are we going to do?
[03:17:12] We're going to kick it.
[03:17:13] Yeah.
[03:17:14] We're going to cruise.
[03:17:15] There's a lake.
[03:17:16] There's kayaks.
[03:17:17] There's a zip lines and whatever.
[03:17:20] Yeah.
[03:17:21] We'll just go lay in bed and try and recover from the Jitsu sessions.
[03:17:25] So yeah.
[03:17:26] A bunch of good people coming up, really good after that, if you want to come up and hang out,
[03:17:30] do it.
[03:17:31] And that will work.
[03:17:34] We'll see you up there.
[03:17:35] Either at the monster or we'll see you at the immersion.
[03:17:38] Jitsu, can't wait.
[03:17:39] How do you register for that one?
