00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 170.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good evening, Echo.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It is time for some Q&A.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay. It has been a while.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yeah.

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's been a while for sure.

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's question.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Questions from the interwebs.

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes indeed.

12
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As it is.

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Said, okay, first question.

14
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Jockel.

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm taking over leadership of a team of six people.

16
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Two, I know and four, I don't.

17
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When you've taken over leadership, did you want give a group talk?

18
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Two, meet with each individual and three.

19
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What did you say?

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Good question.

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Yes, obviously give a group talk.

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's affirmative.

23
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You get everyone together.

24
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Hey guys, my name is Bill.

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I came from this place.

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm here to take over.

27
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, there's a, some judgment calls that you have to make.

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Because you're going to introduce yourself.

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But if you're taking over a well functioning team, then guess what?

30
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You're not going into revamp everything immediately.

31
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Because everything's going fine.

32
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So you're, hey, I'm happy to be working with you guys.

33
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Looking forward to it.

34
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I know you guys have a great reputation.

35
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Glad to be a part of the team.

36
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Awesome.

37
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If you have any questions, let me know.

38
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm here.

39
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That's easy.

40
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If you're taking over a team that's not working well.

41
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Like there's problems.

42
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And that's why if somebody got fired, and that's why you're coming in there, you might need to address some of those things.

43
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Hey, listen, I know things have been a little off track.

44
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm going to look at what's going on.

45
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm going to take input from you guys.

46
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We probably need to make some changes.

47
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We're going to do it together as a team.

48
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That's what we're moving from here.

49
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We need to get back to where we're supposed to be.

50
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Boom, something like that.

51
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And again, there's going to be people on that team that have been busting their ass and working really hard.

52
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And if you go in there and just to spare it, everyone, they're, you're going to start off on the wrong foot.

53
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, yeah, have keep it pretty broad when you meet the whole group.

54
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Hey, this is who I am.

55
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is where I came from.

56
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This is what I'm looking forward to.

57
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
All that stuff.

58
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And then yes, do you meet with people individually?

59
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Absolutely.

60
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You go around.

61
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You meet with them.

62
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And when you, what are you talking about?

63
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You're talking about them.

64
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You're talking about them.

65
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You want to know about them.

66
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You want to know who they, they are.

67
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You want to know what their, what their family situation is.

68
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What their interests are, what's going on.

69
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
How they feel about the transitions that have been taken place a little bit of that stuff.

70
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It's not about you.

71
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's about them.

72
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So go.

73
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yes, and talk to everyone.

74
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Take notes.

75
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Maybe not right in front of them.

76
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So you look like a nerd.

77
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But, you know, afterward you go, hey, Bill has three kids.

78
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
His wife also works at the company.

79
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
He's interested in soccer and basketball.

80
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Whatever you just take those notes.

81
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You know, it's actually good before you take some,

82
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
it's an over a situation.

83
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If you already familiarize yourself with us,

84
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
you look at the maybe the HR website at your company has a picture of everyone.

85
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So you kind of know who they are.

86
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Give you less stuff to remember.

87
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So there's that.

88
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Make good first impression.

89
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Don't go in there.

90
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Looking like an idiot.

91
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Don't go in there thinking that.

92
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Oh, I just, I'm the boss man.

93
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So everyone has to bow down.

94
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And bow down to my superiority.

95
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
No, they're actually mad at you.

96
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Yeah.

97
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The thing is they're mad at you.

98
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So I remember one time I was taking over a small element.

99
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And one of my friends was a part of the element.

100
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And I went in, like 20 guys.

101
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I went in, hey.

102
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I walked in, but I just had a notebook with like five things.

103
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I wanted to talk to them about.

104
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And as soon as I walked in, I opened up my notebook and he's said something like,

105
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You brought a notebook, you're always squared away.

106
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That's why you're putting in charge.

107
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
That's why your put in charge.

108
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So like just a little impression of, hey man, I'm, I take this stuff seriously.

109
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And I would say overall, your main goal when you're meeting your team,

110
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
when you're meeting the individuals on your team,

111
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is you are looking to build relationships with the people on the team.

112
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
That's what your goal is because when you build these relationships,

113
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that's going to make your team stronger, et cetera.

114
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Yeah.

115
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Remember the time when you were on yoga,

116
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Rog and the first time when he was like, hey, you're the only ones who's ever brought a note pad.

117
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You know, and you're like, just trying to be prepared.

118
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Just trying to be prepared.

119
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It was good.

120
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Okay, so there's anything, you know, you know,

121
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
your outfit comes up.

122
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You don't want it to slip your mind.

123
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Yeah, yeah, that's funny.

124
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And I'm trying to imagine being a worker,

125
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and you know, when you get a new manager, you know, whatever new boss.

126
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
You know, the come in.

127
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Yeah, if they were like having an individual meeting,

128
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I would dig it, and then, but if they're like taking notes, I'd be like, wait,

129
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
where are you taking notes?

130
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Like, well, how are you going to use this?

131
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Yeah, you know, against me later or something like that?

132
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
No, sort of, hey, is it all?

133
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Hey, man, how's it going?

134
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
How long you've been here for?

135
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Oh, I've been here for four years.

136
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Oh, cool.

137
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Do you, you married?

138
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Yeah, yeah, I got two kids.

139
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Oh, that's awesome.

140
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.000
That's awesome.

141
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
How long you've been married for?

142
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Oh, six years.

143
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Like that.

144
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You're getting no the person.

145
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
If I go in there and I go, how long you've been here?

146
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And you're like six years and I write it down.

147
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah, right.

148
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And then I say, what, what is your primary function here at the team?

149
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You know what I mean?

150
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
If you just jump right into that, we're not looking to build relationship.

151
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We're just looking to find out how I can use you.

152
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yeah, that's what it feels like.

153
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Yeah, I mean, you said it like, you're like, oh, long you've been married.

154
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
You said it like that, no, man, doesn't matter how you say, you could say it

155
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the most nice polite way ever.

156
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And when you write it down, it's kind of like, bro, like,

157
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you're going to take all this information and sort of do some sort of

158
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
evaluation for me.

159
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You know, kind of, it's what it feels like.

160
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It does feel like that.

161
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That's why I specifically said when you're having a personal conversation with a person

162
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that you're meeting for the first time, you're not scratching it into a

163
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
note pad.

164
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Yeah.

165
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Now that being said, if the guy says, you know what?

166
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I've noticed some things here around here that need changing.

167
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
You go really hold on a second.

168
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Yeah.

169
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Let me break out my notebook here and take notes on what you're about to say.

170
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Yeah, that's a dance.

171
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You know, if you, yes, like when you get a micromanager, you're working for a

172
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
micromanager, bring a notebook.

173
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
They see you write and stuff down.

174
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
They think they're like happy.

175
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Yeah, trick anyone.

176
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Yeah, because when you're writing down there stuff, that's how it slips the

177
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
script.

178
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It makes it like, oh, yeah.

179
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Yeah, he's taking notes to support you.

180
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yeah, I'm saying, yeah, yeah, I think he's going to evaluate my opinion.

181
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Oh, yeah, that's good.

182
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Well, well, and there with the notebook.

183
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's like the doctor.

184
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You know, when you go to the doctor and he's asking, oh, yeah, like all the

185
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
stuff you see him writing down, you know, in your chart, whatever, even though

186
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
a doctor situation is good, because you want him to go evaluate it later, whatever,

187
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
you don't give you cure, but same deal, man, same deal,

188
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
you're with those notes.

189
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yeah, my saint.

190
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Jack, Jack, that goes not prepared for you to take notes on a week.

191
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Not with, well, now my personal stuff, how long you've been married?

192
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Oh, nine years old, keep nine years.

193
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It will grab.

194
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You're in your next question.

195
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Next question.

196
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I'm a sergeant, and I want to know how to deal with my men in a way without

197
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
punishment, but still make them better for next time.

198
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Okay, here's something for you.

199
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Punishment is actually the last straw in how you deal with people that you're in

200
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
charge of.

201
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
In fact, I will tell you this, if I ever had to punish someone, when I had to

202
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
administer punishment on my troops, I always felt that I had to, somewhere

203
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I had done some wrong, right?

204
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Like, even if a guy got in trouble out in town, got drunk, got in a fight,

205
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
did something stupid.

206
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I would still look at that and think to myself, how could I have allowed this guy

207
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to not realize what a disaster it is, how much trouble he's going to get in,

208
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
what kind of international incident he's going to cause, how that's going to

209
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
hurt us in the team strategically, all those things.

210
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
How did I let that happen?

211
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So, dolling out punishment is not optimal.

212
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I mean, you've pretty much, you've pretty much made a mistake if you have to

213
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
punish people because if you're doing, if you're being a good leader, people are

214
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
doing what you want them to do.

215
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
There's no reason for punishment.

216
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, that's what you should not be looking to punish and just like I just said, you should be looking to build relationships.

217
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
You should be looking to show people a better way of doing things, a way that's more

218
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
smooth and more efficient and doesn't disrupt what the team efforts are.

219
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
You've got to explain to people why they're doing what they're doing.

220
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
This is all stuff, right?

221
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
This is to explain why things are done a certain way.

222
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Explain how it impacts the team, explain how it impacts them.

223
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
That's all so important.

224
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You've got to have people rehearse in, in retrain because now I'm talking to, how do you get people to do the right thing, right?

225
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Without punishing them.

226
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So, we're trying to avoid punishment.

227
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
How do we avoid punishment?

228
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
How do we avoid punishment by people understanding what they're doing, why they're doing what they're doing.

229
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000
How do we avoid punishment by setting goals that make sense that are small enough for them to get to?

230
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And then have fun with the goals and get in the game yourself and show them that you're not perfect.

231
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And that is what you need to do.

232
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:10.000
You need to make every effort to make people understand why they're doing, what they're doing, how they fit into the big picture.

233
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And when they figure all that stuff out and they're on board, you shouldn't have to punish people.

234
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
You shouldn't have to punish people.

235
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So, I know it's, yeah, that's what it is.

236
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You're your sergeant and you want to do it through men, we're away without punishment.

237
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Well, think of what the mistakes you're making.

238
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
When you're when you're fire team or your, your, your pulltune does something wrong.

239
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Why did they make that mistake?

240
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
They make the mistake as they wanted to.

241
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
No, they made it because you were a bad leader at that point in time.

242
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You, what could you do better?

243
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Hey guys, where, what did you understand?

244
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Oh, you guys messed up this training operation.

245
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I'm going to restrict your weekend duty.

246
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I'm going to restrict you to weekend duty.

247
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Meaning you can't go out and tell.

248
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
What, what good did I just do?

249
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Right?

250
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Are they going to try harder now?

251
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Right?

252
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But if you say, hey, listen, guys, we did a bad job.

253
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I know I must have made a mistake in trying to explain this information to you all,

254
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
because we didn't do what we were supposed to do.

255
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Let's look, let's dissect this thing.

256
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
As a matter of fact, let's spend Friday night dissecting this thing.

257
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I'm buying pizza, then we'll sit around the, the sand table and we'll figure out what,

258
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
what we did wrong.

259
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
That's not punishment.

260
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
That has the opposite effect of punishment.

261
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
That has, hey, I'm bringing everyone in because I want to win.

262
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I want us all to win.

263
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So that's what you got to do.

264
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Don't punishment should be punishment should be, I mean, do you have to punish people sometimes?

265
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Yes, yes you do.

266
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
When they're blatantly out of line when they do something that's blatantly wrong.

267
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Yeah, you got to drop the hammer on them.

268
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You got to set the example sometimes.

269
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
How you're not going to get away with this?

270
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Sometimes that happened in the dreams.

271
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
You know, somebody would do something stupid.

272
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And the command would just drop the hammer.

273
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And everyone goes, man, that guy got a DUI and they, you know,

274
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
docked him, they busted him in rank and they pulled him out of his platoon.

275
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And they're sending him to a, to a fleet billet for two years.

276
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But you're my god.

277
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
That might make someone think, right?

278
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
You know, maybe I won't step behind the wheel.

279
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Yeah.

280
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So sometimes you do have to punish if people do something stupid,

281
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
especially after they've been warned a couple times.

282
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Yeah.

283
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But I always look if I have to deliver punishment on my team.

284
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I made a mistake somewhere.

285
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I don't like it.

286
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Yeah.

287
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Don't they say that like reward and encouragement is like way more powerful than punished.

288
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Definitely way more powerful.

289
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Way more powerful.

290
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
For sure.

291
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Seems like it.

292
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I've almost never punished people.

293
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Yeah.

294
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Yeah.

295
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But the reason is why did I punish people?

296
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Because people were doing, weren't doing stupid things.

297
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They were doing what they were supposed to be doing.

298
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
They were doing.

299
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Yeah.

300
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I mean, I probably, I don't even know if I,

301
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I probably, I think I had like a one or two captains mass where I had to bring somebody in and drop the hammer on them.

302
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
It's because they did dumb stuff.

303
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Yeah.

304
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It's like, man, you know what?

305
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You can't do that.

306
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I didn't think of it.

307
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But you can't do that.

309
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Yeah.

310
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Pre-persons.

311
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Yeah.

312
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Next question.

313
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Jockel.

314
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
In the discipline equals freedom field manual, the section fear reads.

315
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
How do you overcome fear of failure?

316
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Step.

317
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Go.

318
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
But a previous entry reads,

319
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I don't want you to overcome fear of failure.

320
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I want you to be afraid of failure.

321
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Mind the elaborating.

322
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yeah.

323
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Clearly, there's a dichotomy here.

324
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I know it's my favorite word apparently according to Dean Lister.

325
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Yes.

326
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Okay.

327
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
There is a dichotomy here because fear is something good that you should take advantage of.

328
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So it's kind of good to be afraid because it keeps you on edge.

329
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
It keeps you from slacking.

330
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It keeps you preparing as much as you possibly can and all that stuff is good.

331
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
But at the same time, yes, if you go too far to the other end of the spectrum, fear gets a hold of you.

332
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
You can't overcome it.

333
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So you freeze or you cower or you run away and none of those are good reactions.

334
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So what I obviously failed to communicate well in the book,

335
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Dispony goes freedom field manual is the dichotomy between these spectrum,

336
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
The spectrum of fear that you can have.

337
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So if you have no fear whatsoever, no fear.

338
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Well, guess what?

339
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
You get cocky, you can get arrogant.

340
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
If you have too much fear, you can't even get out of the gate.

341
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You just freeze, you hesitate.

342
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So like all dichotomies, you got to balance those two.

343
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And the way you balance those two is to try and do things that make you feel fear.

344
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
So that way you get used to it, you can overcome it, you can deal with it, you can utilize it.

345
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If you have a fighter, you have to see fighters that I'll come afraid every time I get in the ring.

346
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Pretty much everybody.

347
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Yeah, pretty much everybody.

348
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I'm afraid because you're afraid you're going to get knocked out, you're afraid this, you're afraid that.

349
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Frating and losing front of all my family and friends and all that.

350
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
So everyone's afraid.

351
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So what does that fear do?

352
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It drives you to train harder.

353
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Drives you to prepare, drives you to keep your hands up and your chin down.

354
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
When you're in the key to the end of the world, you're going to have to keep your hands up and your chin down.

355
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
When you're in the cage.

356
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Right.

357
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So yeah, there's a healthy level of fear.

358
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It can also get the best of you.

359
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So keep it balanced.

360
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Yeah, we talked about this and I think Sam Harris talked about it first.

361
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
First I heard it made a point not to go too deep into it.

362
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But where, you know, like this, okay, fear, how do you overcome fear, step go.

363
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Right.

364
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It's essentially like take action, be brave in the face of fear.

365
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
But if there's no fear, it's kind of like, you're not really being brave.

366
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
You're not, you know, kind of think.

367
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Well, that's true, too.

368
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Yeah.

369
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So consider that notion.

370
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Right.

371
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So you say, yeah, I want you to be afraid of failure.

372
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Oh, yeah, be afraid of failure.

373
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
But you still got a step.

374
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
You still got to go.

375
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
You still got to be brave, you know, kind of thing.

376
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So they do actually kind of compliment each other really.

377
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Unless you think like, oh, yeah, overcome fear, meaning like,

378
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I'm not scared of it anymore.

379
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It's literally not figured it's always fear.

380
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It's more, it's less about the fear being, you know, reduced to zero.

381
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
It's more about being brave, training yourself to be brave.

382
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
In brace the fear.

383
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Yeah.

384
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
In brace the fear.

385
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And the end.

386
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So to continue with that thought, in order to embrace the fear, what do you do?

387
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
You step.

388
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Do you go into it.

389
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So there you go.

390
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
There's your answer.

391
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Cool.

392
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
That's a question.

393
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I was wondering when does standing up for the right thing take precedence

394
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
over avoiding conflict?

395
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This is something that leaders have to deal with all the time.

396
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So clearly out of the gate, things that are immoral, unethical, or illegal,

397
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
if you participate, you're guilty.

398
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
That's the way it is.

399
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Now things that are a matter of opinion, that's where you might have to play.

400
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
The long game, like, maybe you don't want to do something a certain way.

401
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And if you, but if you think, oh, well,

402
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I think the jiu-jitsu class warm-ups should be doing these exercises.

403
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And echo things that should be those exercises.

404
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So echo these things we should do it this way.

405
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
No, we should do it this way.

406
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
You dig in.

407
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I dig in.

408
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Now we, we, end up saying, well, I'm not going to teach the class.

409
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
You know, you end up in these situations.

410
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Well, what's the big deal?

411
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
What's, you know, what, what I rather do?

412
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'd rather play the long game.

413
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I'd rather say, hey man, can you explain why you do those exercises?

414
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Oh, here's another exercise cool that I learned.

415
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Isn't this good for this technique?

416
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Oh, you know how you like when I do this move?

417
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
This actually helps me do it even though it's just a warm-up move.

418
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Oh, that's cool.

419
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
We build a little relationship.

420
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
You get to understand me.

421
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I get to understand you.

422
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Boom.

423
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
You also need to say, hey, I'm going to incorporate that into our warm-ups.

424
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So we're going to warm up here, boom.

425
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
There you go.

426
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Now I understand that that's the right thing, right?

427
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Because in my mind, I'm thinking, hey,

428
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
if these students need to know this escape,

429
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
it's the right thing to do.

430
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So I do that.

431
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So you have to weigh it out.

432
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Yeah.

433
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
What am I doing to my relationship in this situation?

434
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
If I go along with this, like if you ask me to do nine things that are pretty

435
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
menial and you're my boss and I say, yep, cool, got it boss and no problem.

436
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And you ask me to do something else.

437
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
It's me.

438
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Yep, cool, got it boss and no problem.

439
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Then you ask me to do something else.

440
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Me, cool, got it boss and no problem.

441
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Then you ask me to do something that's downright stupid and dangerous.

442
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And I go, hey, boss, I need to talk about this.

443
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I'm not sure.

444
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Can you explain to me why we're doing it this way?

445
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Because there's a possibility someone can really get hurt.

446
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
You go, oh, well, you've done it.

447
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
In your mind, you're thinking you've done these ten things for me.

448
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
You've done nine things for me.

449
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
You've done seven things for me.

450
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
You did them well.

451
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
You didn't question me.

452
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Now listen, you have a question.

453
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You must have a legitimate question.

454
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
That's what we're hoping for.

455
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
That's why we're trying to build relationships.

456
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Now, all that being said, yes, we're playing along it.

457
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
There are times.

458
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And this is a really sketchy area to enter into.

459
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
There are times where something that is happening is immoral, unethical,

460
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
or illegal, and you might actually have to kind of go along with it.

461
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I tried to think of a good example of that.

462
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And I thought of one, Oscar Schindler from Schindler's List.

463
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
What did this guy do?

464
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Right?

465
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
This guy was a Nazi.

466
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
He was a Nazi.

467
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
They were exterminating Jews.

468
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And instead of him standing up and saying,

469
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
this is wrong to exterminate Jews, I protest.

470
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
How long would he have lived if he had done that?

471
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Thirty seconds.

472
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Right?

473
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Oh, you don't think Jews should die cool.

474
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
We're killing you.

475
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
That was that.

476
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
How many people did he save?

477
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Zero.

478
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
He would negate if one.

479
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
What did he do?

480
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
He played the game.

481
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
He befriended the Nazi leadership.

482
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
He bought them gifts.

483
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
He bribed them.

484
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
He bought them gifts.

485
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
He built relationships with them.

486
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
He ended up being able to move his factory and all this other stuff

487
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
to save a bunch of Jewish people.

488
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And he even though he knew,

489
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
like he would see them executing people.

490
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
He would see them executing Jews.

491
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And he knew it was wrong.

492
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
He thought it was wrong.

493
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
He felt it was wrong.

494
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And if he would have stood up and said,

495
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
hey, what you're doing is wrong,

496
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
then he wouldn't have been able to save anyone.

497
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
He would have been killed himself.

498
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
So even in that situation,

499
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
it's not a guarantee that you need to stand up to do the ethical thing.

500
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Because perhaps there's a chance you can do the more ethical thing

501
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
by playing the game building relationships.

502
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Who knows?

503
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Who knows?

504
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Maybe if that war went on.

505
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Maybe he would have said, oh, you know what?

506
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Maybe he would have risen to a position where he,

507
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
you know, maybe if the Germans would have won.

508
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And he could have said, hey, you know what?

509
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
The Jewish people are making good workers here.

510
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I'm going to continue to use them or whatever.

511
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
You know, maybe he built up a whole new, you never know.

512
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
But when you get rid of your influence,

513
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
when you lose your influence,

514
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
because you stand up, it might not be the best move.

515
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And the thing that you have to wait for this,

516
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
you have to wait with this is you are participating.

517
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And actually, you know, they say Oscar Schindler felt completely guilty

518
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
because he did participate and he was a part of what was happening.

519
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
He did his best to stop as much as he could,

520
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
but he wish he would have stopped more.

521
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And, you know, at some point, maybe you see a little six year old girl

522
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
getting shot and you think, you know what?

523
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
I should screw it.

524
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I should stand in front of that bullet and take that bullet

525
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
for that little girl.

526
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
You know, that's the kind of guilt that he felt.

527
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So there are times where you really have to wait

528
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
this out.

529
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And also, I'll tell you, I mean, even in things that aren't this big,

530
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
ethical dilemma, head on conflict is generally not the best way

531
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
to solve problems.

532
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Most of the time, it's much smarter to maneuver.

533
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
It's much smarter to flank, and it's much smarter to come from another angle.

534
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And it's much smarter to build allegiance and alliance with people.

535
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
So you can have influence over.

536
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
So you can move them in the right direction.

537
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Yeah, so almost like, actually straight up,

538
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
where doing the right thing and avoiding conflict is kind of like,

539
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
they're not that opposite, you know,

540
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
where doing the avoiding, you should, and I'm totally just

541
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
interpreting this, trying to do it.

542
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Avoiding conflict, you should always be essentially trying to avoid conflict

543
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
as far as, maybe not all the time.

544
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Yeah, but generally speaking, we do a better job.

545
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Then the outcome is better when we avoid conflict.

546
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Now, of course, anyone listening to this,

547
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
oh, you take that to extreme.

548
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
This is someone that never stands up for anything.

549
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Yeah, and that's bad.

550
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And it's also bad from a leadership perspective.

551
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
If your team is looking at you and they think,

552
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Jockel never sticks up for us.

553
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
He never gives the boss any pushback.

554
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
So we're just at the whim of this tyrannical boss,

555
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
and Jockel is no buffer to it.

556
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
That's what they see.

557
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
So you can't just be a pushover, but at the same time,

558
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
if you go to your troops and you say,

559
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
hey, listen, guys, here's what's going on.

560
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
The boss has got a lot of ideas right now.

561
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Some of them are good, some of them not so good.

562
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
But guess what?

563
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
What I'm doing right now, and the reason that we're pushing hard to carry out

564
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
what he's trying to get us to do is to the best of our ability.

565
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The reason we're doing that is because I'm actually trying to build some trust

566
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
with him so that he will listen to me.

567
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Right now, he's not really listening to me.

568
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
He knows I don't have him with much experience,

569
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
but I'm trying to build relationships so he can listen to me so we can actually do this

570
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and what I think is going to be a smarter way.

571
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Can you guys help me build this relationship by kicking ass for the next three projects

572
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
that we've got?

573
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So I can build up some cloud and come back to him and get the tools or the people

574
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
whatever it is that we need.

575
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Yeah, you always have this real finesse sort of way of saying stuff like you.

576
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000
It's what I guess you were saying and I think you were wrong actually.

577
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:21.000
You were saying that standing up and doing the right thing is the same thing as avoiding conflict.

578
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
No, I didn't mean it like that.

579
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
I meant that they're not necessarily always opposite.

580
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
They're not doing the right thing in avoiding conflict.

581
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
There's just some issue wash you kind of room in the wiggle room,

582
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
and when I say avoiding you should always be quote unquote avoiding conflict.

583
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I meant, of course, not always, but I meant more.

584
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Even if I'm going to confront someone or something about something that's wrong,

585
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
I still should be, while I do that, I should be avoiding conflict.

586
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
For sure, doing it in a finesse sort of way to actually just keep everything rolling

587
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
forward, maybe just nudging in a different direction.

588
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.60
But I actually know that I'm sort of reading this again.

589
00:23:55.60 --> 00:23:57.56
I understand what he's asking.

590
00:23:57.56 --> 00:23:59.32
It's like, is there a time where it's like,

591
00:23:59.32 --> 00:24:00.96
hey, there's gonna be conflict?

592
00:24:00.96 --> 00:24:04.04
Is there a time where it's worth the conflict?

593
00:24:04.04 --> 00:24:05.44
And where is that point?

594
00:24:05.44 --> 00:24:07.000
You know, at the point that I always give is,

595
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.08
if you're telling me, hey, Jocco, go do the mission this way

596
00:24:10.08 --> 00:24:12.76
and I'm like, you know what, I'm not doing it.

597
00:24:12.76 --> 00:24:15.08
And you go, okay, find your fire.

598
00:24:15.08 --> 00:24:18.36
And now, do you put someone some yes man in my place

599
00:24:18.36 --> 00:24:19.92
and then that yes man gets everyone killed

600
00:24:19.92 --> 00:24:22.000
because it was a stupid plan.

601
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.84
Did I really help?

602
00:24:22.84 --> 00:24:25.000
Or should I have said, hey, boss, I'm really gonna recommend

603
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.76
we do it in a different way here, some different options.

604
00:24:26.76 --> 00:24:28.76
And then finally you say no, Jocco, you do it my way

605
00:24:28.76 --> 00:24:31.56
and guess what, even then I can go on mitigate and the field.

606
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:33.64
Even then I can say, you know what?

607
00:24:33.64 --> 00:24:37.20
And the classic example that is in band brothers,

608
00:24:37.20 --> 00:24:41.88
when Dick Winners of awesome leader,

609
00:24:41.88 --> 00:24:44.000
they send a recon mission across the river,

610
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
one night, someone dies, they come back,

611
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.44
the war's over, it's all but over.

612
00:24:49.44 --> 00:24:51.92
And the next night they want to do another reconnaissance mission.

613
00:24:51.92 --> 00:24:54.04
And Dick Winners is like, sir, I'm not sure that's a great idea.

614
00:24:54.04 --> 00:24:54.96
He's like, do it.

615
00:24:54.96 --> 00:24:56.52
He goes, okay, Roger that.

616
00:24:56.52 --> 00:24:58.84
The guys go down, they drink a couple bottles of wine

617
00:24:58.84 --> 00:25:01.40
in the bottom of the, they don't do the mission.

618
00:25:01.40 --> 00:25:02.80
He mitigated the risk.

619
00:25:02.80 --> 00:25:04.84
If you would have stood up and, you know,

620
00:25:04.84 --> 00:25:09.16
that's a great example of where he avoided conflict.

621
00:25:09.16 --> 00:25:10.16
He stayed in the game.

622
00:25:10.16 --> 00:25:13.64
He wasn't, he said yes, yes sir, got it, we got it.

623
00:25:13.64 --> 00:25:15.16
And then he did disobeyed.

624
00:25:15.16 --> 00:25:17.84
Sure, he put his, he put his rank at risk

625
00:25:17.84 --> 00:25:19.12
and probably could have gotten in some trouble

626
00:25:19.12 --> 00:25:20.28
but he knew his the right thing to do.

627
00:25:20.28 --> 00:25:24.68
Yeah, that was like the best sort of way to do him.

628
00:25:24.68 --> 00:25:29.68
And again, you, you're always thinking of like the long game.

629
00:25:31.04 --> 00:25:33.36
versus the short game, you know, where it's like,

630
00:25:33.36 --> 00:25:37.16
and we can keep that perspective, these things become a little bit more clear,

631
00:25:37.16 --> 00:25:38.40
you know, they always do.

632
00:25:39.60 --> 00:25:40.60
Yes, sir.

633
00:25:40.60 --> 00:25:43.48
Next question, Jockel, I recently interviewed for a team,

634
00:25:43.48 --> 00:25:48.68
lead job, but wasn't selected because I don't have leadership experience.

635
00:25:48.68 --> 00:25:51.16
How can I lead what I'm not in charge?

636
00:25:51.16 --> 00:25:52.76
Well, you're in charge of something.

637
00:25:52.76 --> 00:25:54.72
You're certainly in charge of something.

638
00:25:54.72 --> 00:25:56.56
You're in charge of some piece of gear.

639
00:25:56.56 --> 00:25:58.08
You're in charge of some task.

640
00:25:58.08 --> 00:26:00.40
You're in charge of maybe a couple people here or there,

641
00:26:00.40 --> 00:26:02.04
but even if you're not, you're in charge of something.

642
00:26:02.04 --> 00:26:04.84
So whatever you're in charge of, take charge of it.

643
00:26:05.88 --> 00:26:08.96
Take charge of whatever your task is you take charge of it.

644
00:26:08.96 --> 00:26:10.44
You own it, you do it to perfection.

645
00:26:10.44 --> 00:26:12.000
Then once you've got that completely dialed,

646
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.96
then you know what, you reach out and you see who else you can help.

647
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.28
You help with other tasks.

648
00:26:17.28 --> 00:26:20.04
You look for work. If you look for work, you're going to find it.

649
00:26:20.04 --> 00:26:22.32
You're going to find it.

650
00:26:22.32 --> 00:26:23.16
You're going to find it.

651
00:26:23.16 --> 00:26:24.96
You're going to start taking things from other people.

652
00:26:24.96 --> 00:26:29.28
Now what you have to be careful of is that you don't step on toes, right?

653
00:26:29.28 --> 00:26:32.40
Because just about everyone, think about this.

654
00:26:32.40 --> 00:26:35.64
Just about everyone is offended by someone that wants to be in charge.

655
00:26:35.64 --> 00:26:36.64
Right.

656
00:26:36.64 --> 00:26:38.44
Hey, let me take charge of this here.

657
00:26:38.44 --> 00:26:38.92
Right.

658
00:26:38.92 --> 00:26:41.20
Is that right there makes people cringe?

659
00:26:41.20 --> 00:26:42.20
What to take lead on this?

660
00:26:42.20 --> 00:26:43.36
Let me just, you know what?

661
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:44.48
Hey, listen up, guys.

662
00:26:44.48 --> 00:26:45.16
Right.

663
00:26:45.16 --> 00:26:47.64
If you're that guy, then everyone goes, hmm.

664
00:26:47.64 --> 00:26:48.92
Now there's a key point.

665
00:26:48.92 --> 00:26:50.12
This is beautiful.

666
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:51.12
This is beautiful.

667
00:26:51.12 --> 00:26:53.72
So let's say we're in a cartoon.

668
00:26:53.72 --> 00:26:55.84
There's something going on.

669
00:26:55.84 --> 00:26:57.92
In a mid grade position.

670
00:26:57.92 --> 00:27:01.48
And I realize like, I want to be lead, right?

671
00:27:01.48 --> 00:27:04.20
Now if I just go in and go, hey, guys, let me run this next mission.

672
00:27:04.20 --> 00:27:05.72
People are like, do you know what are you talking about?

673
00:27:05.72 --> 00:27:07.20
You don't know anything.

674
00:27:07.20 --> 00:27:08.60
OK.

675
00:27:08.60 --> 00:27:11.92
And they're kind of dug in against me, by the way, at that point.

676
00:27:11.92 --> 00:27:17.16
If I give it a knife, I let things escalate a little bit.

677
00:27:17.16 --> 00:27:24.68
What I would usually do is I would let things escalate to a point to where when I took

678
00:27:24.68 --> 00:27:29.04
charge, people were waiting for it and they were happy that I took charge.

679
00:27:29.04 --> 00:27:31.72
Then even though I was, even though I was tasked in a manner, like if you're tasked

680
00:27:31.72 --> 00:27:34.36
in a commander, OK, so I got late and stone are working for me.

681
00:27:34.36 --> 00:27:37.52
I'm tasked in a commander, we're out on an operation.

682
00:27:37.52 --> 00:27:38.96
Something starts going wrong.

683
00:27:38.96 --> 00:27:39.96
Right.

684
00:27:39.96 --> 00:27:43.08
If I'm doing a building clearance with his platoon, something starts going wrong.

685
00:27:43.08 --> 00:27:46.92
I'd jump down there and say, all right, guys, push over that way, start clearing that hallway.

686
00:27:46.92 --> 00:27:47.92
How does Lay feel?

687
00:27:47.92 --> 00:27:49.92
Yeah, kind of.

688
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:50.92
Yeah.

689
00:27:50.92 --> 00:27:51.92
Fees.

690
00:27:51.92 --> 00:27:55.48
He feels like I jumped down and micromanage his platoon and why are you doing this?

691
00:27:55.48 --> 00:27:56.48
Everything was going fine.

692
00:27:56.48 --> 00:27:58.24
So I don't want to do that.

693
00:27:58.24 --> 00:28:01.44
I want, first of all, I want him to work things out, of course.

694
00:28:01.44 --> 00:28:03.44
So let's say, same things happening.

695
00:28:03.44 --> 00:28:05.64
Things are going a little bit bad.

696
00:28:05.64 --> 00:28:06.96
There's starting to be a little bit of confusion.

697
00:28:06.96 --> 00:28:10.88
There's starting to be escalated voices. There's starting to people be, you know, hey, wait, wait,

698
00:28:10.88 --> 00:28:11.88
no, don't go there.

699
00:28:11.88 --> 00:28:12.88
You can hear it.

700
00:28:12.88 --> 00:28:14.28
It's really obvious when things are going wrong.

701
00:28:14.28 --> 00:28:16.76
I might let that escalate a little bit.

702
00:28:16.76 --> 00:28:20.56
Let it get to a point where the life knows, she doesn't have control this anymore.

703
00:28:20.56 --> 00:28:23.20
Now like I'm going to go, hey, everyone lock it up.

704
00:28:23.20 --> 00:28:24.68
You four hold on that hallway.

705
00:28:24.68 --> 00:28:26.56
You two start clearing that back room.

706
00:28:26.56 --> 00:28:28.32
Everyone else gets to the rooftop and all security.

707
00:28:28.32 --> 00:28:29.32
You know what everyone thinks?

708
00:28:29.32 --> 00:28:30.32
Including life?

709
00:28:30.32 --> 00:28:31.96
They go, thank God that just happened.

710
00:28:31.96 --> 00:28:32.96
Right.

711
00:28:32.96 --> 00:28:35.000
Now, and that can happen from anywhere in the chain of command.

712
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.92
I'm happening, I happen to be given an example when I was the task commander, but I would

713
00:28:38.92 --> 00:28:44.40
do the same thing when I was an E5, which is, oh, things are going a little bit sideways.

714
00:28:44.40 --> 00:28:47.84
No one wants to hear the guy that as soon as they opportunity.

715
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:54.20
As soon as there's any void of leadership, you're just jumping in there like, okay, guys,

716
00:28:54.20 --> 00:28:56.92
Captain America, to the rescue, right?

717
00:28:56.92 --> 00:28:58.12
You don't want to do that.

718
00:28:58.12 --> 00:28:59.12
You want to let that.

719
00:28:59.12 --> 00:29:00.60
I'll tell you what happens.

720
00:29:00.60 --> 00:29:03.32
If there's a little tiny void that you try and jump into, guess what you're going to do.

721
00:29:03.32 --> 00:29:06.08
You're going to bump into everyone else that's in that void.

722
00:29:06.08 --> 00:29:09.20
You have to meet an actual void of leadership.

723
00:29:09.20 --> 00:29:15.48
Once that actual void of leadership opens up, and it's big enough, you jump in there.

724
00:29:15.48 --> 00:29:19.60
Because you've detached, because you are detached, because you're watching it happen,

725
00:29:19.60 --> 00:29:22.48
you jump in there and you have so much confidence in what you're saying.

726
00:29:22.48 --> 00:29:24.60
You have so much understanding of the situation.

727
00:29:24.60 --> 00:29:27.92
You look like a genius and everyone's happy that you just did that.

728
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:32.20
And by the way, as soon as that problem gets solved, you step back out, the leadership

729
00:29:32.20 --> 00:29:35.36
void is closed up by someone else and you're good to go.

730
00:29:35.36 --> 00:29:40.000
And next time, people will not be surprised at all when something goes wrong and you're

731
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
stepping and you've solved the problem.

732
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.72
So that's what you should do.

733
00:29:43.72 --> 00:29:47.04
You, yes, you want to be in charge, yes, you should look for work, but you can't step on

734
00:29:47.04 --> 00:29:48.04
toes.

735
00:29:48.04 --> 00:29:51.80
Don't jump in every time, you get like Captain America.

736
00:29:51.80 --> 00:29:53.04
I'm going to save the day.

737
00:29:53.04 --> 00:29:55.12
No, you're not.

738
00:29:55.12 --> 00:29:59.32
Let there be a real problem, assess it from the outside.

739
00:29:59.32 --> 00:30:03.48
And like I said, you got to be careful about being Captain America.

740
00:30:03.48 --> 00:30:04.96
You got to be careful about being on.

741
00:30:04.96 --> 00:30:07.84
I'm going to, I'm ready to stand up every moment.

742
00:30:07.84 --> 00:30:08.84
And that's a problem.

743
00:30:08.84 --> 00:30:14.20
You know, it's a problem when someone's goal is going to sound weird.

744
00:30:14.20 --> 00:30:19.48
When someone's goal is to be a leader, like my goal is to be a leader.

745
00:30:19.48 --> 00:30:24.36
Like if that's what they're thinking, that's going to offend people.

746
00:30:24.36 --> 00:30:25.36
It's going to offend people.

747
00:30:25.36 --> 00:30:28.08
Because, and I'll say why it offends people to rightfully so.

748
00:30:28.08 --> 00:30:29.64
You know why it offends people?

749
00:30:29.64 --> 00:30:30.64
Because what is it about?

750
00:30:30.64 --> 00:30:32.64
It's about me.

751
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:33.84
I want to be a leader.

752
00:30:33.84 --> 00:30:36.28
I mean me want to lead.

753
00:30:36.28 --> 00:30:37.28
That's what it's about.

754
00:30:37.28 --> 00:30:38.88
And everyone recognize that.

755
00:30:38.88 --> 00:30:42.84
If what you really want to do is you want the team to win.

756
00:30:42.84 --> 00:30:45.96
And you realize that sometimes you're going to be in a supporting role and sometimes there

757
00:30:45.96 --> 00:30:51.76
might be in a situation where you need to lead almost hesitantly, you know what?

758
00:30:51.76 --> 00:30:52.76
Leadership needs to happen.

759
00:30:52.76 --> 00:30:55.56
I'll go make it happen because the team needs it to win.

760
00:30:55.56 --> 00:30:57.12
I'm here for the team.

761
00:30:57.12 --> 00:30:59.40
So don't be the person about yourself.

762
00:30:59.40 --> 00:31:00.40
We don't like that person.

763
00:31:00.40 --> 00:31:01.96
I don't even like that person.

764
00:31:01.96 --> 00:31:05.08
As much as I love people that want to step up and lead, I don't want that person.

765
00:31:05.08 --> 00:31:09.04
That's like looking for themselves.

766
00:31:09.04 --> 00:31:10.60
Sometimes you've got to be following.

767
00:31:10.60 --> 00:31:12.28
I want someone that's like, hey, oh cool.

768
00:31:12.28 --> 00:31:13.28
I got your back.

769
00:31:13.28 --> 00:31:14.28
Don't worry about.

770
00:31:14.28 --> 00:31:15.28
I'm over here.

771
00:31:15.28 --> 00:31:16.28
I'm over here part of the train.

772
00:31:16.28 --> 00:31:17.28
I'm over here clearing rooms.

773
00:31:17.28 --> 00:31:19.04
Oh wait a second, there's a leadership void.

774
00:31:19.04 --> 00:31:20.52
And now there's an actual problem going on.

775
00:31:20.52 --> 00:31:22.60
Oh, and then that person suddenly steps up and solves the problem.

776
00:31:22.60 --> 00:31:24.88
Then goes right back down to their level.

777
00:31:24.88 --> 00:31:25.88
Awesome.

778
00:31:25.88 --> 00:31:26.88
That's the person you want.

779
00:31:26.88 --> 00:31:27.88
That's person you want to be.

780
00:31:27.88 --> 00:31:30.32
Yeah, you know how like now they're here.

781
00:31:30.32 --> 00:31:32.48
A lot nowadays where they're add value.

782
00:31:32.48 --> 00:31:33.76
You just want to add value.

783
00:31:33.76 --> 00:31:35.28
So what's the sense you're what you're doing?

784
00:31:35.28 --> 00:31:37.000
Even now that leads to situation.

785
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.28
It's like boom, I'm going to add value.

786
00:31:38.28 --> 00:31:40.76
So one, okay, if you're going to start with my own role.

787
00:31:40.76 --> 00:31:43.28
You know, that's where I'm going to add the most value in my own role.

788
00:31:43.28 --> 00:31:50.76
But if there's little voids in whatever capacity that needs some value added, I'm going

789
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:51.76
to add that value.

790
00:31:51.76 --> 00:31:54.52
But you can't just be piling on the value where it's not needed.

791
00:31:54.52 --> 00:31:59.80
No, don't don't put additional value into non-value needing areas exactly.

792
00:31:59.80 --> 00:32:01.44
That's problematic too much value.

793
00:32:01.44 --> 00:32:02.44
It's true.

794
00:32:02.44 --> 00:32:03.44
All right, next question.

795
00:32:03.44 --> 00:32:05.20
Hi, Jocco.

796
00:32:05.20 --> 00:32:08.80
When you're trying to take ownership of a mistake made by a fellow team member, what

797
00:32:08.80 --> 00:32:14.24
do you do if the team leader asks for a step by step step by step breakdown of events?

798
00:32:14.24 --> 00:32:19.52
I've said it was arm mistake and not to end not made excuses.

799
00:32:19.52 --> 00:32:24.40
But a step by step breakdown would expose the fact that he alone was responsible for

800
00:32:24.40 --> 00:32:25.40
that error.

801
00:32:25.40 --> 00:32:26.40
Interesting.

802
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:28.40
Do you think that's interesting?

803
00:32:28.40 --> 00:32:32.96
It is, wait, so he's saying, okay, it's arm mistake.

804
00:32:32.96 --> 00:32:38.48
I don't want to individualize this guy or make him stand out of whatever.

805
00:32:38.48 --> 00:32:40.52
It's arm mistake and we're going to fix it kind of thing.

806
00:32:40.52 --> 00:32:41.80
And he's like, no, I want the step by step.

807
00:32:41.80 --> 00:32:45.36
The step step step step step is going to reveal the so-lo.

808
00:32:45.36 --> 00:32:47.76
Actually, bills fall.

809
00:32:47.76 --> 00:32:52.20
And now what I tried so hard to take ownership.

810
00:32:52.20 --> 00:32:55.72
Here's the fault.

811
00:32:55.72 --> 00:32:59.20
It was actually build that was all jacked up.

812
00:32:59.20 --> 00:33:00.20
It's actually not my fault.

813
00:33:00.20 --> 00:33:01.96
It's the truth, right?

814
00:33:01.96 --> 00:33:02.96
You get that, right?

815
00:33:02.96 --> 00:33:05.60
Yeah, because check it out.

816
00:33:05.60 --> 00:33:07.60
Who's responsible?

817
00:33:07.60 --> 00:33:11.32
When you're taking ownership of something, when you're taking extreme ownership of something,

818
00:33:11.32 --> 00:33:12.32
whose fault is it?

819
00:33:12.32 --> 00:33:13.32
Your mind?

820
00:33:13.32 --> 00:33:14.32
Yeah, sure.

821
00:33:14.32 --> 00:33:17.12
Was that include when someone else on your team makes a mistake?

822
00:33:17.12 --> 00:33:18.12
Yes.

823
00:33:18.12 --> 00:33:19.32
But how can that be?

824
00:33:19.32 --> 00:33:21.12
Good, it's here.

825
00:33:21.12 --> 00:33:23.48
So let me ask you these questions.

826
00:33:23.48 --> 00:33:26.36
Here's what I'd be thinking.

827
00:33:26.36 --> 00:33:30.12
The teammate was in error.

828
00:33:30.12 --> 00:33:31.12
Why?

829
00:33:31.12 --> 00:33:33.56
Why did the teammate make a mistake?

830
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:35.84
Why didn't the teammate have backup?

831
00:33:35.84 --> 00:33:37.76
Why didn't the rest of the members of the team?

832
00:33:37.76 --> 00:33:42.36
Why didn't I actually go through with him and make sure that he knew how to do that procedure

833
00:33:42.36 --> 00:33:43.36
properly?

834
00:33:43.36 --> 00:33:45.16
He's part of my team.

835
00:33:45.16 --> 00:33:46.92
We're responsible for this taking place.

836
00:33:46.92 --> 00:33:50.64
I knew he was a little bit shaky and I didn't do anything to fix it.

837
00:33:50.64 --> 00:33:52.20
That's why it's our fault.

838
00:33:52.20 --> 00:33:56.08
It's not our fault because we say, oh, it's our fault, but it's really bill.

839
00:33:56.08 --> 00:33:58.84
That's not what we're talking about.

840
00:33:58.84 --> 00:34:01.20
The point is, the point is to actually own it.

841
00:34:01.20 --> 00:34:07.56
So with my coworker fails, I'm literally saying to myself, what mistake did I make that

842
00:34:07.56 --> 00:34:11.000
my coworker drop the ball?

843
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.60
What mistake did I make?

844
00:34:12.60 --> 00:34:15.000
My coworker dropped the ball.

845
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.20
What mistake did I make?

846
00:34:17.20 --> 00:34:18.80
Did I not show it to him?

847
00:34:18.80 --> 00:34:20.44
Did I not ask him if you knew how to do it?

848
00:34:20.44 --> 00:34:22.000
Did I not ask him if he needed some help?

849
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.84
Did I not confirm that he knew the procedures correctly?

850
00:34:24.84 --> 00:34:27.48
All those things are my fault.

851
00:34:27.48 --> 00:34:32.52
Did I not do a good job of identifying that bill as a little bit slow on the uptake?

852
00:34:32.52 --> 00:34:36.84
And therefore he needed a little extra preparation for this.

853
00:34:36.84 --> 00:34:38.000
And now think about this.

854
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
What can I do?

855
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.48
Once I make this mistake, we're going to do the fix.

856
00:34:40.48 --> 00:34:43.44
I'm going to think about this from a leadership perspective.

857
00:34:43.44 --> 00:34:47.48
You go down and you say, hey, you guys messed up this thing.

858
00:34:47.48 --> 00:34:49.04
Why did it happen?

859
00:34:49.04 --> 00:34:50.92
Now think about the team wherever it goes.

860
00:34:50.92 --> 00:34:53.16
Well, it's our fault.

861
00:34:53.16 --> 00:34:55.16
Mostly bill.

862
00:34:55.16 --> 00:34:56.16
Right?

863
00:34:56.16 --> 00:34:57.16
Sure.

864
00:34:57.16 --> 00:35:06.36
And I'll tell you, when I look at a pollotoon and bill made a mistake, I don't look at bill.

865
00:35:06.36 --> 00:35:08.04
A good leader doesn't just look at bill.

866
00:35:08.04 --> 00:35:11.28
A good leadership looks at everyone on the team, especially certainly the leadership.

867
00:35:11.28 --> 00:35:14.08
But I think this guy's talking about from a peer, but it doesn't matter.

868
00:35:14.08 --> 00:35:19.000
From a peer perspective, if there's a mistake that happens, we are truly response

869
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.48
possible.

870
00:35:21.48 --> 00:35:25.56
And then from a leadership perspective, when I go down to the team and I say, hey, guys,

871
00:35:25.56 --> 00:35:26.56
what happened?

872
00:35:26.56 --> 00:35:28.08
And they say, well, it was our fault.

873
00:35:28.08 --> 00:35:29.56
But this is what bill did.

874
00:35:29.56 --> 00:35:31.16
I go, okay, so you just drop in nine months bill.

875
00:35:31.16 --> 00:35:32.16
I'm not going to say that.

876
00:35:32.16 --> 00:35:33.36
But I'm like, I think it's not okay.

877
00:35:33.36 --> 00:35:34.36
So it's all bill's fault.

878
00:35:34.36 --> 00:35:35.36
Cool.

879
00:35:35.36 --> 00:35:36.76
I'll tell you what.

880
00:35:36.76 --> 00:35:39.64
Whereas if you say, hey, listen, bosses is what happened.

881
00:35:39.64 --> 00:35:40.96
Here's the procedures we went.

882
00:35:40.96 --> 00:35:44.84
I don't think we did a good job of briefing bill because here's what bill did.

883
00:35:44.84 --> 00:35:47.32
He did step three instead of step four.

884
00:35:47.32 --> 00:35:50.40
I fault we went through twice, but why should have gone through it a couple more times

885
00:35:50.40 --> 00:35:51.88
and confirmed he knew it was going on?

886
00:35:51.88 --> 00:35:52.72
It's not going to happen again.

887
00:35:52.72 --> 00:35:54.04
We got this.

888
00:35:54.04 --> 00:35:55.72
Which guy you want to work for?

889
00:35:55.72 --> 00:35:56.80
Which guy do you want?

890
00:35:56.80 --> 00:35:58.40
Which team do you want?

891
00:35:58.40 --> 00:36:05.04
You want the team where people are taking ownership of the problem, not blaming Bill.

892
00:36:05.04 --> 00:36:09.48
Ownership is not just saying we own it.

893
00:36:09.48 --> 00:36:12.20
Ownership is actually owning it.

894
00:36:12.20 --> 00:36:14.32
And that's what makes it so powerful.

895
00:36:14.32 --> 00:36:19.92
If you actually own it, then you actually look at Bill beforehand and you go look in our

896
00:36:19.92 --> 00:36:20.92
team.

897
00:36:20.92 --> 00:36:21.92
Do we have any weaknesses?

898
00:36:21.92 --> 00:36:22.92
Yeah, we do.

899
00:36:22.92 --> 00:36:25.20
Bill doesn't bill can't get this part of the procedure done right.

900
00:36:25.20 --> 00:36:26.20
Here's what we're going to do.

901
00:36:26.20 --> 00:36:28.20
We're going to put Bill into this other position.

902
00:36:28.20 --> 00:36:29.80
That's an easier part of the procedure.

903
00:36:29.80 --> 00:36:30.88
We're going to make sure he knows how to do that.

904
00:36:30.88 --> 00:36:35.000
Meanwhile, we're taking Mike and Mike is going to go down here and he nails this procedure

905
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.56
and he's going to spend, by the way, in extra 15 minutes a day during lunch, he's going

906
00:36:38.56 --> 00:36:40.64
to get Bill's trained up so Bill can eventually think.

907
00:36:40.64 --> 00:36:42.64
That's the kind of thing you do on a team.

908
00:36:42.64 --> 00:36:43.64
Yeah.

909
00:36:43.64 --> 00:36:51.08
You made it pretty clear with just, which is kind of, because it's not that easy to understand

910
00:36:51.08 --> 00:36:52.40
or it wasn't for me anyway.

911
00:36:52.40 --> 00:36:54.16
I mean, it was put it this way.

912
00:36:54.16 --> 00:36:58.92
It was very valuable when I didn't understand this about extreme ownership.

913
00:36:58.92 --> 00:37:00.76
I said this before too, by the way.

914
00:37:00.76 --> 00:37:04.84
So there's essentially two parts of it that make it extreme ownership.

915
00:37:04.84 --> 00:37:08.08
Actually, there's three because there's the dichotomy, but aside from the dichotomy, this

916
00:37:08.08 --> 00:37:09.08
is what it is.

917
00:37:09.08 --> 00:37:14.80
You take responsibility and then you say what you're going to do to fix the problem.

918
00:37:14.80 --> 00:37:17.20
And then actually there's a third part, which is you implement the solution.

919
00:37:17.20 --> 00:37:18.20
Yes, yes, yes.

920
00:37:18.20 --> 00:37:19.20
You identify it.

921
00:37:19.20 --> 00:37:20.52
You own the problem.

922
00:37:20.52 --> 00:37:23.76
You identify a solution for the problem and then you implement the solution.

923
00:37:23.76 --> 00:37:24.76
Yes.

924
00:37:24.76 --> 00:37:25.76
That's what you do.

925
00:37:25.76 --> 00:37:26.76
Yeah.

926
00:37:26.76 --> 00:37:29.40
So a lot of times, especially in the beginning, like I would just as far as me just kind

927
00:37:29.40 --> 00:37:33.40
of casually trying to understand it, I would focus so much on taking responsibility.

928
00:37:33.40 --> 00:37:34.40
You know, it was my fault.

929
00:37:34.40 --> 00:37:36.40
You know, kind of thing.

930
00:37:36.40 --> 00:37:44.08
It's like, well, the taking responsibility is arguably more important than saying that

931
00:37:44.08 --> 00:37:45.84
it's your fault kind of thing.

932
00:37:45.84 --> 00:37:49.64
It's essentially your taking responsibility of the solution as well.

933
00:37:49.64 --> 00:37:55.04
If not, in a way, in a lot of practical cases, you don't even have to identify who's

934
00:37:55.04 --> 00:37:59.16
fault it is if you take responsibility of the solution.

935
00:37:59.16 --> 00:38:01.48
If I'm okay here.

936
00:38:01.48 --> 00:38:06.12
So if there's a full-ball team, just like the epitome of team, not the epitome, but

937
00:38:06.12 --> 00:38:07.56
want a good example of teamwork.

938
00:38:07.56 --> 00:38:09.68
Never mind the sales teams or whatever, but we're going to go with it.

939
00:38:09.68 --> 00:38:13.68
Well, football is pretty, it'll be more simple because it's so let's say, okay, we've

940
00:38:13.68 --> 00:38:18.80
got to pass or whatever and boom, the place, the place starts and a guy gets through the

941
00:38:18.80 --> 00:38:19.80
front line.

942
00:38:19.80 --> 00:38:23.80
Let's say the guard missed a block.

943
00:38:23.80 --> 00:38:25.92
Obviously, right?

944
00:38:25.92 --> 00:38:26.92
He missed it.

945
00:38:26.92 --> 00:38:28.72
Maybe he looked one way and he was supposed to look this way.

946
00:38:28.72 --> 00:38:31.000
He was supposed to not pull and he tried to pull or something.

947
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Maybe he just made a mistake.

948
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
He just made a mistake.

949
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
He's not incompetent.

950
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
He just made a mistake.

951
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Who's fault is it?

952
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Okay.

953
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.56
But if the quarterback's going to take extreme ownership, he's going to be like, hey,

954
00:38:40.56 --> 00:38:42.24
no part of the, hey, this happened.

955
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:44.96
You know, next time we were, I'm going to remind him of him.

956
00:38:44.96 --> 00:38:50.60
This play that play, you know, this red 46, don't curve twist whatever.

957
00:38:50.60 --> 00:38:53.88
Like you don't pull and he probably probably be like, I'm not, I know.

958
00:38:53.88 --> 00:38:55.64
I know, don't go to school them.

959
00:38:55.64 --> 00:38:57.76
Just feel like he, you don't go, hey, no problem.

960
00:38:57.76 --> 00:38:59.20
But we're just not going to do that anymore.

961
00:38:59.20 --> 00:39:02.36
And then next time I call that play, I'm be like, you're good, right?

962
00:39:02.36 --> 00:39:03.76
I'm going to check with him.

963
00:39:03.76 --> 00:39:04.76
I didn't check with him.

964
00:39:04.76 --> 00:39:05.76
He won't make them a mistake.

965
00:39:05.76 --> 00:39:06.76
I'm going to check with him.

966
00:39:06.76 --> 00:39:07.76
He won't make them a mistake.

967
00:39:07.76 --> 00:39:10.68
And kind of like you, when we were now, we're driving, that he didn't mean, you know?

968
00:39:10.68 --> 00:39:11.68
It's kind of one of those things.

969
00:39:11.68 --> 00:39:15.12
The quarterback took responsibility for solving the problem.

970
00:39:15.12 --> 00:39:18.52
More so than he was like, okay, looks, that was my fault.

971
00:39:18.52 --> 00:39:20.12
They're making a big deal out of it being his fault.

972
00:39:20.12 --> 00:39:21.12
Yeah.

973
00:39:21.12 --> 00:39:23.20
You know, in his head, it is, you know, it's like, okay, this is my fault.

974
00:39:23.20 --> 00:39:26.52
I should, you know, I should make sure things are clear kind of thing.

975
00:39:26.52 --> 00:39:28.12
Like the weather, too.

976
00:39:28.12 --> 00:39:29.12
You know, your weather is bad.

977
00:39:29.12 --> 00:39:30.12
Yeah.

978
00:39:30.12 --> 00:39:34.64
Well, what bothers me the most about this question is, I feel like I feel like I feel

979
00:39:34.64 --> 00:39:38.000
like I don't do a good job of explaining this.

980
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.24
Because what bothers me out is someone who ever wrote this question.

981
00:39:41.24 --> 00:39:42.24
And it's a good question.

982
00:39:42.24 --> 00:39:43.48
I get the question.

983
00:39:43.48 --> 00:39:47.88
I get scared that the person that's listening to the question goes, no, John, what

984
00:39:47.88 --> 00:39:48.88
doesn't quite get it.

985
00:39:48.88 --> 00:39:54.28
He doesn't quite get the fact that there was this one guy who was part of the team, who

986
00:39:54.28 --> 00:39:56.64
made this mistake.

987
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:00.48
And no one, you know, we just, we can't hold his hand every time.

988
00:40:00.48 --> 00:40:02.28
Like, that's, it's not my fault.

989
00:40:02.28 --> 00:40:07.04
Not our teams fault when Bill drop completely drops the ball.

990
00:40:07.04 --> 00:40:08.52
That's not my fault.

991
00:40:08.52 --> 00:40:10.44
It's not anyone on the team's fault.

992
00:40:10.44 --> 00:40:15.52
And my point is, is exactly what you are saying, Echo.

993
00:40:15.52 --> 00:40:17.36
Yes, it is.

994
00:40:17.36 --> 00:40:23.24
And if you look at it when Bill makes the mistake himself, he's alone in a room.

995
00:40:23.24 --> 00:40:31.28
And he's supposed to, you know, he's supposed to put part A on top of part B and bolt them

996
00:40:31.28 --> 00:40:32.12
together.

997
00:40:32.12 --> 00:40:33.12
His part of the job.

998
00:40:33.12 --> 00:40:35.24
He's alone in a room doing that.

999
00:40:35.24 --> 00:40:36.24
And he doesn't do it.

1000
00:40:36.24 --> 00:40:37.24
Right?

1001
00:40:37.24 --> 00:40:38.68
That's 100% his fault.

1002
00:40:38.68 --> 00:40:44.60
The answer is no, actually, who's in charge of training him?

1003
00:40:44.60 --> 00:40:48.28
Who's in charge of checking who, who, not even in charge of who's responsible.

1004
00:40:48.28 --> 00:40:50.28
We are a team.

1005
00:40:50.28 --> 00:40:51.92
That means we work together.

1006
00:40:51.92 --> 00:40:56.16
That means we confirm that we know how to do our individual parts of the job.

1007
00:40:56.16 --> 00:40:58.80
That means we check and say, hey, Bill, are you good?

1008
00:40:58.80 --> 00:41:01.84
Hey, Bill, let me check your first three that you do to make sure you understand what's

1009
00:41:01.84 --> 00:41:02.84
happening.

1010
00:41:02.84 --> 00:41:04.44
We do this together as a team.

1011
00:41:04.44 --> 00:41:11.80
And it makes me feel like a failure that people have a hard time understanding this.

1012
00:41:11.80 --> 00:41:13.76
And I know it can be a stretch.

1013
00:41:13.76 --> 00:41:14.76
It can be a stretch.

1014
00:41:14.76 --> 00:41:16.60
And, you know, I give all those examples.

1015
00:41:16.60 --> 00:41:18.40
Hey, the machine gun or shoots in the wrong direction.

1016
00:41:18.40 --> 00:41:19.40
Who's fault is that?

1017
00:41:19.40 --> 00:41:20.40
It's not the machine.

1018
00:41:20.40 --> 00:41:23.04
The machine gun or literally pointed the machine gun in the wrong direction, pulled

1019
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:24.84
the trigger and shot in the wrong direction.

1020
00:41:24.84 --> 00:41:26.48
Who's fault is it?

1021
00:41:26.48 --> 00:41:27.80
It's the squad leaders.

1022
00:41:27.80 --> 00:41:28.80
It's the fire team leaders.

1023
00:41:28.80 --> 00:41:30.12
It's the platoon leaders.

1024
00:41:30.12 --> 00:41:32.72
Because they didn't make sure that he understood his field of fire.

1025
00:41:32.72 --> 00:41:34.16
Make sure he understood how to operate his weapon.

1026
00:41:34.16 --> 00:41:38.88
And by the way, there's a chance that the reason that Bill screwed this up and Bill is

1027
00:41:38.88 --> 00:41:42.000
incapable of putting these parts together correctly.

1028
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.68
And if that is the situation, guess what?

1029
00:41:44.68 --> 00:41:48.52
It is a responsibility of the team to either get him trained up to where he can do it or

1030
00:41:48.52 --> 00:41:53.04
to tell the leadership that this guy cannot be incapable of doing the job.

1031
00:41:53.04 --> 00:41:56.60
And therefore, he needs to not be here.

1032
00:41:56.60 --> 00:41:58.04
That's what ownership is.

1033
00:41:58.04 --> 00:42:00.76
That's what extreme ownership is.

1034
00:42:00.76 --> 00:42:02.84
I think I know what it is.

1035
00:42:02.84 --> 00:42:08.20
What makes it confusing or sometimes kind of slippery to grasp.

1036
00:42:08.20 --> 00:42:11.28
Because it depends on who you ask.

1037
00:42:11.28 --> 00:42:15.92
So a lot of times, the thing is when it's the machine gun is fault, the thing is if I'm

1038
00:42:15.92 --> 00:42:20.56
not even a human being, I'm just a disembodied brain.

1039
00:42:20.56 --> 00:42:25.84
Okay, it's the machine gun is fault and the leader is fault and it's everyone's fault.

1040
00:42:25.84 --> 00:42:29.28
If I'm dead, but if you ask the individual person, because you ask a machine gun,

1041
00:42:29.28 --> 00:42:32.80
hey, okay, jockey, you're the machine gun, you shot in the wrong direction and I ask you

1042
00:42:32.80 --> 00:42:33.80
who's fault is that?

1043
00:42:33.80 --> 00:42:34.80
What are you going to say?

1044
00:42:34.80 --> 00:42:35.80
My leader's fault?

1045
00:42:35.80 --> 00:42:36.80
Well, it's your fault.

1046
00:42:36.80 --> 00:42:42.32
Well, let me tell you right now, there are plenty of people and definitely plenty of

1047
00:42:42.32 --> 00:42:45.48
machine gunners that when they shoot that weapon in the wrong direction, no, what they

1048
00:42:45.48 --> 00:42:48.52
say, I didn't get a clear brief on what the field of firework.

1049
00:42:48.52 --> 00:42:52.24
No one, I didn't see the markers for what the range limits were.

1050
00:42:52.24 --> 00:42:54.64
I didn't know where the other blue forces were.

1051
00:42:54.64 --> 00:42:55.64
No one told me.

1052
00:42:55.64 --> 00:42:58.40
So they're looking at it like it actually isn't their fault.

1053
00:42:58.40 --> 00:43:01.08
Now you get some good machine and actually guess what?

1054
00:43:01.08 --> 00:43:05.08
When you have a guy, that's a machine gunner that says, well, what was my fault?

1055
00:43:05.08 --> 00:43:06.08
It was my leader's fault.

1056
00:43:06.08 --> 00:43:07.80
You know what the leader says?

1057
00:43:07.80 --> 00:43:08.80
You know what the leader says?

1058
00:43:08.80 --> 00:43:09.80
What?

1059
00:43:09.80 --> 00:43:10.80
The leader's bad leader.

1060
00:43:10.80 --> 00:43:12.04
The leader in this team.

1061
00:43:12.04 --> 00:43:13.36
The leader in this team, you know what he says?

1062
00:43:13.36 --> 00:43:15.000
No, it was the machine gunner's fault.

1063
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
That's right.

1064
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.28
And now, guess who's fault it was?

1065
00:43:17.28 --> 00:43:18.28
It was no one's fault.

1066
00:43:18.28 --> 00:43:19.96
The machine gunner think is the boss's fault.

1067
00:43:19.96 --> 00:43:21.28
The boss thinks it was the machine gunner's fault.

1068
00:43:21.28 --> 00:43:22.28
Now who's going to fix the problem?

1069
00:43:22.28 --> 00:43:23.28
The answer is no one.

1070
00:43:23.28 --> 00:43:27.08
When you get a good team, the machine gunner goes to my fault.

1071
00:43:27.08 --> 00:43:28.08
I should have paid their attention.

1072
00:43:28.08 --> 00:43:29.32
The leader says my fault.

1073
00:43:29.32 --> 00:43:33.52
And now you have everyone taking ownership of the problems.

1074
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:34.52
Yes.

1075
00:43:34.52 --> 00:43:35.80
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1076
00:43:35.80 --> 00:43:36.80
But that's my point.

1077
00:43:36.80 --> 00:43:37.80
And that's why it makes it so hard.

1078
00:43:37.80 --> 00:43:39.92
Never mind your disembodied brain.

1079
00:43:39.92 --> 00:43:41.64
That's making decisions over here.

1080
00:43:41.64 --> 00:43:43.36
I'm trying to make a point though.

1081
00:43:43.36 --> 00:43:45.60
I'm saying this is what it's hard for people to understand.

1082
00:43:45.60 --> 00:43:46.60
That's why sometimes.

1083
00:43:46.60 --> 00:43:47.60
I'm with them.

1084
00:43:47.60 --> 00:43:50.80
I'm like, there it's kind of like, it's kind of like, sure.

1085
00:43:50.80 --> 00:43:52.60
I'm tricking to shoot ownership, you know, the typical.

1086
00:43:52.60 --> 00:43:53.60
I'm taking ownership.

1087
00:43:53.60 --> 00:43:56.56
But yeah, I don't have to end the day or we all know it's built for.

1088
00:43:56.56 --> 00:44:01.76
But the reason that it is so hard because if I ask, okay, we have three guys.

1089
00:44:01.76 --> 00:44:02.96
One of those guys is the machine gunner.

1090
00:44:02.96 --> 00:44:05.36
The other guys are leading the other guys just another team member.

1091
00:44:05.36 --> 00:44:09.24
He's, you know, he's the sniper or something.

1092
00:44:09.24 --> 00:44:11.68
If I say, hey, this machine gunner shot in the wrong direction.

1093
00:44:11.68 --> 00:44:15.36
Individual meetings, they all take extreme ownership, all of them are down.

1094
00:44:15.36 --> 00:44:16.36
They're in the game.

1095
00:44:16.36 --> 00:44:17.36
The all of them.

1096
00:44:17.36 --> 00:44:19.76
I ask you machine gunner.

1097
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:20.76
Who's fault is that?

1098
00:44:20.76 --> 00:44:21.76
What's he going to say?

1099
00:44:21.76 --> 00:44:24.000
Well, okay, next guy who's faulted.

1100
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Fire's you leader.

1101
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
My fault.

1102
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
I shouldn't.

1103
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And the, yeah.

1104
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Squad leader, my fault.

1105
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
I should have told them.

1106
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Right.

1107
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Yeah.

1108
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
So the read now go back to the disembodied brain.

1109
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.08
It's kind of like, way, way, way.

1110
00:44:34.08 --> 00:44:36.40
So it's like, he did it.

1111
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:40.44
It's hard to grasp like that.

1112
00:44:40.44 --> 00:44:42.68
One guy, it is his fault.

1113
00:44:42.68 --> 00:44:44.24
The thing is not just his fault.

1114
00:44:44.24 --> 00:44:47.24
Apparently, because everyone said it's their fault.

1115
00:44:47.24 --> 00:44:48.52
So he was obviously his fault.

1116
00:44:48.52 --> 00:44:50.40
But wait, it's everyone's fault kind of thing.

1117
00:44:50.40 --> 00:44:54.000
So when you're the guy and you're saying, okay, his fault, it that little thing creeps

1118
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
in your brain.

1119
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.72
That's like, yeah, wait, it is his fault.

1120
00:44:56.72 --> 00:44:57.72
Yeah.

1121
00:44:57.72 --> 00:44:58.72
You know, and you're wrong.

1122
00:44:58.72 --> 00:44:59.72
Yeah.

1123
00:44:59.72 --> 00:45:00.72
And you're wrong.

1124
00:45:00.72 --> 00:45:05.000
And I need to do a better job of explaining to people because I see questions

1125
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.64
like this on a fairly regular basis, which is, but hey, really.

1126
00:45:10.64 --> 00:45:13.16
You know, there's a guy, I get ownership, but really.

1127
00:45:13.16 --> 00:45:14.16
Yeah.

1128
00:45:14.16 --> 00:45:15.16
That's what I mean.

1129
00:45:15.16 --> 00:45:17.16
It's the butt, really, that you need to check yourself on.

1130
00:45:17.16 --> 00:45:18.16
Yeah.

1131
00:45:18.16 --> 00:45:21.24
Because the reality is you're responsible.

1132
00:45:21.24 --> 00:45:21.92
Yeah.

1133
00:45:21.92 --> 00:45:22.68
You.

1134
00:45:22.68 --> 00:45:25.24
Wait, but if I'm responsible, what about the machine?

1135
00:45:25.24 --> 00:45:27.88
He just said he's responsible for the machine gunner.

1136
00:45:27.88 --> 00:45:28.88
You're responsible.

1137
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:31.28
I know, but the machine gunner said he's responsible.

1138
00:45:31.28 --> 00:45:32.16
Let's see what I'm saying now.

1139
00:45:32.16 --> 00:45:35.08
I think that's the feeling that that you let that creep in.

1140
00:45:35.08 --> 00:45:35.44
Yeah.

1141
00:45:35.44 --> 00:45:36.32
And that's going to be a problem.

1142
00:45:36.32 --> 00:45:37.64
Yeah.

1143
00:45:37.64 --> 00:45:39.60
You've seen office space.

1144
00:45:39.60 --> 00:45:40.12
Yeah.

1145
00:45:40.12 --> 00:45:41.12
Yeah.

1146
00:45:41.12 --> 00:45:43.80
So really, when you think about, okay, what's the big thing?

1147
00:45:43.80 --> 00:45:45.68
I don't think he has the movie remembers.

1148
00:45:45.68 --> 00:45:46.52
Yeah, you do.

1149
00:45:46.52 --> 00:45:48.68
Okay, let me remind you, okay.

1150
00:45:48.68 --> 00:45:54.04
So in the beginning, they were like, hey, Peter, we're putting cover sheets on the TPS reports

1151
00:45:54.04 --> 00:45:55.04
from now on.

1152
00:45:55.04 --> 00:45:56.04
We've been doing that.

1153
00:45:56.04 --> 00:45:57.68
You forgot to do that.

1154
00:45:57.68 --> 00:45:58.68
Right?

1155
00:45:58.68 --> 00:46:00.60
So first lumber comes his boss.

1156
00:46:00.60 --> 00:46:03.44
First lumber comes his like, yeah, you know, saying, hey, let me read.

1157
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:04.44
He didn't do it in a thick way.

1158
00:46:04.44 --> 00:46:08.28
I know I ain't for sure, but he said, hey, this is basically a reminder.

1159
00:46:08.28 --> 00:46:09.28
Did you get that memo?

1160
00:46:09.28 --> 00:46:10.88
We're putting cover sheets on the TPS reports.

1161
00:46:10.88 --> 00:46:12.28
He said, yeah, I just forgot.

1162
00:46:12.28 --> 00:46:13.88
It was one time thing, no problem.

1163
00:46:13.88 --> 00:46:19.16
He's like cool, all that, you know, so if you just do that, do that, that'd be cool.

1164
00:46:19.16 --> 00:46:20.16
And he's like, cool, no problem.

1165
00:46:20.16 --> 00:46:22.44
He's all, I'll even give you another copy of that memo.

1166
00:46:22.44 --> 00:46:24.44
He almost like over did it.

1167
00:46:24.44 --> 00:46:25.44
Not almost he did over do it.

1168
00:46:25.44 --> 00:46:26.44
So he left.

1169
00:46:26.44 --> 00:46:30.24
And then the other boss boom, who was like one level down, he came, same deal.

1170
00:46:30.24 --> 00:46:32.68
Hey, we're putting, did you get that memo?

1171
00:46:32.68 --> 00:46:34.88
TPS reports, cover sheets now, probably.

1172
00:46:34.88 --> 00:46:36.44
He's like, I got the memo.

1173
00:46:36.44 --> 00:46:37.60
I forgot one time thing.

1174
00:46:37.60 --> 00:46:43.60
He's like, yeah, I'm just all those bosses were doing, making sure the problem got solved.

1175
00:46:43.60 --> 00:46:45.12
Right, doing everything in their power.

1176
00:46:45.12 --> 00:46:47.64
Even his other, his friends were like, hey, what's up?

1177
00:46:47.64 --> 00:46:50.000
I heard you guys, you're having problems with your TPS.

1178
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.56
So they were just taking extreme ownership, taking ownership of the problem, trying to solve

1179
00:46:53.56 --> 00:46:54.56
it.

1180
00:46:54.56 --> 00:46:56.40
But we give them crap about it.

1181
00:46:56.40 --> 00:46:58.04
Who do we give a movie?

1182
00:46:58.04 --> 00:46:59.04
You know, movie somewhere?

1183
00:46:59.04 --> 00:47:01.52
Yeah, yeah, because they're trying to make it funny, dude.

1184
00:47:01.52 --> 00:47:02.76
Yeah, I know.

1185
00:47:02.76 --> 00:47:03.76
But that's kind of ironic.

1186
00:47:03.76 --> 00:47:04.76
It's ironic.

1187
00:47:04.76 --> 00:47:05.88
But yeah, I know, but it's ironic, right?

1188
00:47:05.88 --> 00:47:06.88
It is.

1189
00:47:06.88 --> 00:47:07.88
You know.

1190
00:47:07.88 --> 00:47:09.36
So I'm not even mad at Lumberg for that.

1191
00:47:09.36 --> 00:47:10.92
Let's say in the next question.

1192
00:47:10.92 --> 00:47:11.92
Hi, Jockel.

1193
00:47:11.92 --> 00:47:14.44
Question for you. I know you're very busy guy.

1194
00:47:14.44 --> 00:47:18.000
How do you find time to read so many books?

1195
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.16
I have many that I want to read, but I've trouble having enough time.

1196
00:47:23.16 --> 00:47:26.88
Any advice on how to set aside time to do so?

1197
00:47:26.88 --> 00:47:28.88
Yeah, sure.

1198
00:47:28.88 --> 00:47:30.44
All right, land on me.

1199
00:47:30.44 --> 00:47:31.44
Make time.

1200
00:47:31.44 --> 00:47:35.04
What are you doing all day?

1201
00:47:35.04 --> 00:47:38.84
What are you doing all day?

1202
00:47:38.84 --> 00:47:39.84
The clock's sick.

1203
00:47:39.84 --> 00:47:40.84
What are you doing all day?

1204
00:47:40.84 --> 00:47:41.84
Are you watching TV?

1205
00:47:41.84 --> 00:47:44.36
Are you surfing the internet?

1206
00:47:44.36 --> 00:47:46.56
Are you watching YouTube videos?

1207
00:47:46.56 --> 00:47:48.48
That's my question.

1208
00:47:48.48 --> 00:47:51.08
What are you doing before you go to sleep at night?

1209
00:47:51.08 --> 00:47:53.96
Are you looking at Twitter?

1210
00:47:53.96 --> 00:48:02.08
Are you looking at Instagram posts, Instagram videos?

1211
00:48:02.08 --> 00:48:05.60
Tell me they're not like an addiction.

1212
00:48:05.60 --> 00:48:08.44
You get the Instagram video.

1213
00:48:08.44 --> 00:48:11.96
One of them is funny, they're 38 seconds long.

1214
00:48:11.96 --> 00:48:12.96
They're one minute long.

1215
00:48:12.96 --> 00:48:16.60
Get to see people hurt themselves, get to see people do dumb things.

1216
00:48:16.60 --> 00:48:18.28
Make you feel good about yourself.

1217
00:48:18.28 --> 00:48:20.44
I didn't do that dumb thing.

1218
00:48:20.44 --> 00:48:21.44
Someone else did.

1219
00:48:21.44 --> 00:48:22.44
I can laugh at them.

1220
00:48:22.44 --> 00:48:27.08
How long you're going to look at those videos for when you could be reading.

1221
00:48:27.08 --> 00:48:29.56
So there you go.

1222
00:48:29.56 --> 00:48:31.44
Stop wasting a bunch of time.

1223
00:48:31.44 --> 00:48:33.20
And then what about audio books?

1224
00:48:33.20 --> 00:48:36.08
What are you doing when you're mowing the lawn?

1225
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:38.40
What are you doing when you're trimming the hedges?

1226
00:48:38.40 --> 00:48:40.56
What are you doing when you're pulling weeds?

1227
00:48:40.56 --> 00:48:42.36
What are you doing when you're cleaning the dishes?

1228
00:48:42.36 --> 00:48:44.56
Get some audio books.

1229
00:48:44.56 --> 00:48:46.32
Get some audio books.

1230
00:48:46.32 --> 00:48:48.56
What are you doing first thing in the morning?

1231
00:48:48.56 --> 00:48:50.96
What are you doing?

1232
00:48:50.96 --> 00:49:00.68
Are you waking up, checking your email, sitting around, waiting, wasting a bunch of time?

1233
00:49:00.68 --> 00:49:04.40
Are you getting up early enough that you could just get up and get out of bed?

1234
00:49:04.40 --> 00:49:08.08
Go and read for 30 minutes.

1235
00:49:08.08 --> 00:49:09.08
That's what you have to do.

1236
00:49:09.08 --> 00:49:10.08
You have to make time.

1237
00:49:10.08 --> 00:49:12.08
There's plenty of time to read.

1238
00:49:12.08 --> 00:49:15.08
There's plenty of time to read.

1239
00:49:15.08 --> 00:49:23.08
You probably don't want to read as badly as you think.

1240
00:49:23.08 --> 00:49:26.08
If you wanted to read that bad, you'd make time.

1241
00:49:26.08 --> 00:49:28.08
You make time to breathe somehow.

1242
00:49:28.08 --> 00:49:32.08
If you can make time to breathe, you can make time to read.

1243
00:49:32.08 --> 00:49:34.08
Let's say it's the best.

1244
00:49:34.08 --> 00:49:36.08
Yeah, it would be a better one.

1245
00:49:36.08 --> 00:49:38.08
Because yeah, eat, I think.

1246
00:49:38.08 --> 00:49:41.08
Because read, you can read while you're doing other things sometimes.

1247
00:49:41.08 --> 00:49:42.08
Especially with the others.

1248
00:49:42.08 --> 00:49:48.08
Just kind of as a, so I'm reading, I'm always have to be reading a book to read a book

1249
00:49:48.08 --> 00:49:49.08
for the podcast, right?

1250
00:49:49.08 --> 00:49:54.08
I had only read the first maybe 10 books that we read that we did in the podcast.

1251
00:49:54.08 --> 00:49:56.08
We've done a hundred or something now.

1252
00:49:56.08 --> 00:49:57.08
Probably more than that.

1253
00:49:57.08 --> 00:49:59.08
I don't read like 10 of them.

1254
00:49:59.08 --> 00:50:00.08
Maybe it may be a few more.

1255
00:50:00.08 --> 00:50:02.08
But I'd read them so long ago.

1256
00:50:02.08 --> 00:50:03.08
Maybe I'd read 30.

1257
00:50:03.08 --> 00:50:05.08
But I'd read some of them so long ago that just,

1258
00:50:05.08 --> 00:50:07.08
I had to reread them.

1259
00:50:07.08 --> 00:50:10.08
And so then you said to yourself, okay.

1260
00:50:10.08 --> 00:50:12.08
So when, when you don't when I read all the time,

1261
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:15.08
I read going about reading, wake up, reading.

1262
00:50:15.08 --> 00:50:18.08
Going in an airplane.

1263
00:50:18.08 --> 00:50:21.08
People, what do people do in an airplane?

1264
00:50:21.08 --> 00:50:23.08
See, watch a movie, I know you sleep.

1265
00:50:23.08 --> 00:50:24.08
They do all this stuff.

1266
00:50:24.08 --> 00:50:25.08
I sleep sometimes in an airplane.

1267
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:27.08
But if you're not sleeping, you get us a guess on what I'm doing.

1268
00:50:27.08 --> 00:50:28.08
Reading, forever, forever, forever.

1269
00:50:28.08 --> 00:50:29.08
I can't test it out.

1270
00:50:29.08 --> 00:50:30.08
Yeah.

1271
00:50:30.08 --> 00:50:34.08
What do you think is the, like, the biggest ones that people are,

1272
00:50:34.08 --> 00:50:39.08
you know, that you know, the biggest activities that they could,

1273
00:50:39.08 --> 00:50:42.08
yeah, they could just stop.

1274
00:50:42.08 --> 00:50:47.08
And for me, I think the biggest time sucks are YouTube.

1275
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:50.08
I think Instagram.

1276
00:50:50.08 --> 00:50:51.08
Yeah.

1277
00:50:51.08 --> 00:50:53.08
I think those two are really,

1278
00:50:53.08 --> 00:50:56.08
what's the word stimulating to the brain?

1279
00:50:56.08 --> 00:50:57.08
Yeah.

1280
00:50:57.08 --> 00:50:59.08
And you actually get this weird, like, well, I actually,

1281
00:50:59.08 --> 00:51:01.08
like, I'm going to learn a little something from this right here.

1282
00:51:01.08 --> 00:51:03.08
I'm going to take something away from this.

1283
00:51:03.08 --> 00:51:04.08
I'm going to veg out.

1284
00:51:04.08 --> 00:51:09.08
I'm going to escape from my world right now.

1285
00:51:09.08 --> 00:51:11.08
It's like a scapeysm, right?

1286
00:51:11.08 --> 00:51:12.08
Yeah.

1287
00:51:12.08 --> 00:51:18.08
And they, they actually have algorithms that are,

1288
00:51:18.08 --> 00:51:22.08
that know what you will click on.

1289
00:51:22.08 --> 00:51:24.08
They actually know that about you.

1290
00:51:24.08 --> 00:51:27.08
They mapped your little brain.

1291
00:51:27.08 --> 00:51:31.08
And know that if they put up a video that has,

1292
00:51:31.08 --> 00:51:34.08
if they put up a thumbnail of a video,

1293
00:51:34.08 --> 00:51:38.08
and it's got a heavy machine gun in it,

1294
00:51:38.08 --> 00:51:41.08
they know they got a good chance I'm going to click on it.

1295
00:51:41.08 --> 00:51:42.08
Right?

1296
00:51:42.08 --> 00:51:45.08
And then they give it a catch phrase title, right?

1297
00:51:45.08 --> 00:51:46.08
No.

1298
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:47.08
They give it a catch phrase title.

1299
00:51:47.08 --> 00:51:49.08
I just get's massacre.

1300
00:51:49.08 --> 00:51:51.08
I got to watch that.

1301
00:51:51.08 --> 00:51:52.08
Got to do it.

1302
00:51:52.08 --> 00:51:52.08
Yeah.

1303
00:51:52.08 --> 00:51:53.08
Oh, click.

1304
00:51:53.08 --> 00:51:54.08
Oh.

1305
00:51:54.08 --> 00:51:57.08
50 cow versus Taliban.

1306
00:51:57.08 --> 00:51:58.08
Oh, cool.

1307
00:51:58.08 --> 00:51:59.08
Black.

1308
00:51:59.08 --> 00:52:01.08
Yeah.

1309
00:52:01.08 --> 00:52:02.08
Yeah.

1310
00:52:02.08 --> 00:52:04.08
And actually, no words you're going to click on.

1311
00:52:04.08 --> 00:52:07.08
And that's, that's, so, and what do you get out of it?

1312
00:52:07.08 --> 00:52:10.08
You watch it for 20 minutes.

1313
00:52:10.08 --> 00:52:11.08
Or game.

1314
00:52:11.08 --> 00:52:12.08
Yeah.

1315
00:52:12.08 --> 00:52:13.08
You get nothing out of it.

1316
00:52:13.08 --> 00:52:14.08
You get a book.

1317
00:52:14.08 --> 00:52:15.08
You read.

1318
00:52:15.08 --> 00:52:16.08
You learn.

1319
00:52:16.08 --> 00:52:17.08
You write something.

1320
00:52:17.08 --> 00:52:18.08
That's what you do.

1321
00:52:18.08 --> 00:52:19.08
Yeah.

1322
00:52:19.08 --> 00:52:20.08
And actually, the YouTube thing is,

1323
00:52:20.08 --> 00:52:25.08
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not just YouTube,

1324
00:52:25.08 --> 00:52:27.08
but who's trying to get you to watch the video.

1325
00:52:27.08 --> 00:52:28.08
It's the video makers themselves.

1326
00:52:28.08 --> 00:52:29.08
So YouTube has the algorithm.

1327
00:52:29.08 --> 00:52:31.08
Oh, they got it all kind of sorted out there.

1328
00:52:31.08 --> 00:52:37.08
And now the video makers, they make titles like 50 cow versus XYZ and awful bunch of things too.

1329
00:52:37.08 --> 00:52:38.08
And guess what?

1330
00:52:38.08 --> 00:52:40.08
50 cow versus you can fill in the blank.

1331
00:52:40.08 --> 00:52:42.08
You're probably going to watch that video.

1332
00:52:42.08 --> 00:52:43.08
Doesn't matter.

1333
00:52:43.08 --> 00:52:44.08
Don't matter.

1334
00:52:44.08 --> 00:52:45.08
Motivation speech ever.

1335
00:52:45.08 --> 00:52:46.08
Yes.

1336
00:52:46.08 --> 00:52:47.08
They get with the sentence.

1337
00:52:47.08 --> 00:52:48.08
Oh, yeah.

1338
00:52:48.08 --> 00:52:53.08
So, and so destroys whatever destroys reporter in interview.

1339
00:52:53.08 --> 00:52:54.08
Yeah.

1340
00:52:54.08 --> 00:52:55.08
Exactly.

1341
00:52:55.08 --> 00:52:56.08
Right.

1342
00:52:56.08 --> 00:52:57.08
So once you really owned.

1343
00:52:57.08 --> 00:52:58.08
Yeah.

1344
00:52:58.08 --> 00:53:11.08
So basically, right when you log onto YouTube, once YouTube pops up on your screen, bro, everyone on that screen is all sucking your attention.

1345
00:53:11.08 --> 00:53:13.08
Literally, that's their job sucking your attention.

1346
00:53:13.08 --> 00:53:15.08
So, yeah, man, that's a big one.

1347
00:53:15.08 --> 00:53:16.08
Right, Instagram.

1348
00:53:16.08 --> 00:53:18.08
So here's the, here's one that really hit me really hard.

1349
00:53:18.08 --> 00:53:19.08
The Graham.

1350
00:53:19.08 --> 00:53:20.08
The Graham.

1351
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:21.08
And I like Instagram.

1352
00:53:21.08 --> 00:53:22.08
It's like, good.

1353
00:53:22.08 --> 00:53:26.08
But if you're like trying to read, you know, if you want to read more, whatever,

1354
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:31.08
consider like, even like, let's say we start recording this for a second, we're going to look at the boss of our phones.

1355
00:53:31.08 --> 00:53:34.08
We're going to maybe check in email, maybe we got to text or whatever.

1356
00:53:34.08 --> 00:53:37.08
And the probability of Instagram coming up on there.

1357
00:53:37.08 --> 00:53:44.08
We're going to, you know, open it, but the probability of us opening Instagram is pretty significant.

1358
00:53:44.08 --> 00:53:45.08
It's pretty high.

1359
00:53:45.08 --> 00:53:47.08
And you know, scroll through there, whatever.

1360
00:53:47.08 --> 00:53:49.08
Even if you scroll for two, three minutes, right?

1361
00:53:49.08 --> 00:53:50.08
You scroll through there.

1362
00:53:50.08 --> 00:53:54.08
Maybe what you looked at, I don't know, 15, 20 people's posts.

1363
00:53:54.08 --> 00:53:56.08
Read what they had to say.

1364
00:53:56.08 --> 00:54:01.08
But if you have a, what do you, what do you, what do you call like, kindle or something?

1365
00:54:01.08 --> 00:54:02.08
But you do that same thing.

1366
00:54:02.08 --> 00:54:05.08
It's like kind of, like, if you're saying you could read.

1367
00:54:05.08 --> 00:54:06.08
Yeah, read instead.

1368
00:54:06.08 --> 00:54:12.08
So if you had a camera like once you said like, imagine your video, video tape, like, what if you were being video tape all day?

1369
00:54:12.08 --> 00:54:18.08
And all it was calculate every time you opened up Instagram or Facebook or Twitter and or YouTube all those particular.

1370
00:54:18.08 --> 00:54:22.08
Every time you open up, but instead, you had that scenario in one average day.

1371
00:54:22.08 --> 00:54:27.08
Then you take all that time and replace it with you opened your Kindle to read or boss out of book.

1372
00:54:27.08 --> 00:54:29.08
You know, you're bringing books or whatever with you.

1373
00:54:29.08 --> 00:54:32.08
And that's how to, instead of doing that, you did the book.

1374
00:54:32.08 --> 00:54:34.08
Right, and how much reading you do, right, you'd read so much.

1375
00:54:34.08 --> 00:54:35.08
A lot of reading.

1376
00:54:35.08 --> 00:54:36.08
Yeah.

1377
00:54:36.08 --> 00:54:38.08
So it's like, yeah, those are the time sucks, man.

1378
00:54:38.08 --> 00:54:39.08
You're phone.

1379
00:54:39.08 --> 00:54:42.08
It's so available, you know, but right, you can read on your phone too.

1380
00:54:42.08 --> 00:54:43.08
That's a big one.

1381
00:54:43.08 --> 00:54:44.08
TV2.

1382
00:54:44.08 --> 00:54:46.08
You watched TV?

1383
00:54:46.08 --> 00:54:47.08
Not really.

1384
00:54:47.08 --> 00:54:52.08
But I watched one show now. And actually two, Hawaii 5.0 and that's it.

1385
00:54:52.08 --> 00:54:53.08
Sometimes Shark Tank.

1386
00:54:53.08 --> 00:54:54.08
That's it, man.

1387
00:54:54.08 --> 00:54:55.08
100% swear.

1388
00:54:55.08 --> 00:54:56.08
What is it?

1389
00:54:56.08 --> 00:54:58.08
How often is a Hawaii 5.0 on?

1390
00:54:58.08 --> 00:54:59.08
One to week.

1391
00:54:59.08 --> 00:55:00.08
And it goes in season.

1392
00:55:00.08 --> 00:55:01.08
So you got it.

1393
00:55:01.08 --> 00:55:02.08
How long is this season?

1394
00:55:02.08 --> 00:55:03.08
I don't know.

1395
00:55:03.08 --> 00:55:04.08
13 episodes, I guess.

1396
00:55:04.08 --> 00:55:05.08
I don't know.

1397
00:55:05.08 --> 00:55:06.08
I don't know.

1398
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:07.08
But nonetheless.

1399
00:55:07.08 --> 00:55:10.08
I have watched one TV show recently.

1400
00:55:10.08 --> 00:55:11.08
What?

1401
00:55:11.08 --> 00:55:12.08
It's called billions.

1402
00:55:12.08 --> 00:55:13.08
No, well.

1403
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:14.08
You know.

1404
00:55:14.08 --> 00:55:18.08
There's a little scenario unfolding on billions.

1405
00:55:18.08 --> 00:55:19.08
So.

1406
00:55:19.08 --> 00:55:20.08
All right.

1407
00:55:20.08 --> 00:55:24.08
Well, you know, actually, yeah, actually, yeah.

1408
00:55:24.08 --> 00:55:28.08
And keep in mind, it's not like I've never seen any other show ever.

1409
00:55:28.08 --> 00:55:29.08
And never will.

1410
00:55:29.08 --> 00:55:30.08
It's not that.

1411
00:55:30.08 --> 00:55:30.08
Yeah.

1412
00:55:30.08 --> 00:55:31.08
I'm just saying, you know how people they like take a watch.

1413
00:55:31.08 --> 00:55:32.08
I know.

1414
00:55:32.08 --> 00:55:38.08
And actually, I will separate the fact that nowadays, you can watch TV in a different way.

1415
00:55:38.08 --> 00:55:39.08
Right.

1416
00:55:39.08 --> 00:55:41.08
It's not like at eight o'clock on a Thursday night.

1417
00:55:41.08 --> 00:55:42.08
You got to sit there and watch.

1418
00:55:42.08 --> 00:55:45.08
It's not like a 30 minute show with the 30 minutes worth of commercials in it.

1419
00:55:45.08 --> 00:55:46.08
Yeah.

1420
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:46.08
Right.

1421
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:51.08
No, you can, you're, you're on a flight somewhere.

1422
00:55:51.08 --> 00:55:53.08
You've read, you've got to take it easy on your eyes a little bit.

1423
00:55:53.08 --> 00:55:55.08
If you start reading too much, you've read for a long time.

1424
00:55:55.08 --> 00:55:57.08
Okay, you're going to stare out the window for a little while.

1425
00:55:57.08 --> 00:55:59.08
Listen to this part of a podcast or something.

1426
00:55:59.08 --> 00:56:02.08
Then you're like, okay, my brain is like barely functioning.

1427
00:56:02.08 --> 00:56:03.08
Yeah.

1428
00:56:03.08 --> 00:56:04.08
Okay.

1429
00:56:04.08 --> 00:56:05.08
I'm going to watch an episode of billions.

1430
00:56:05.08 --> 00:56:06.08
Yeah.

1431
00:56:06.08 --> 00:56:07.08
Well, the ballers.

1432
00:56:07.08 --> 00:56:08.08
Everything ballers.

1433
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:11.08
I don't know the different, well, I do know the different.

1434
00:56:11.08 --> 00:56:12.08
Yeah.

1435
00:56:12.08 --> 00:56:13.08
I just don't know the different.

1436
00:56:13.08 --> 00:56:16.08
It's like, you know, like, you know, like, people have a routine, like,

1437
00:56:16.08 --> 00:56:21.08
tenet, you know, every night for 30 minutes, they watch TV with their kids or whatever.

1438
00:56:21.08 --> 00:56:24.08
It's like that doesn't really happen anymore.

1439
00:56:24.08 --> 00:56:25.08
Yeah.

1440
00:56:25.08 --> 00:56:27.08
Next question.

1441
00:56:27.08 --> 00:56:28.08
You really.

1442
00:56:28.08 --> 00:56:37.08
Sad how much time you can waste these days with the distractions and the people trying to get that time from you.

1443
00:56:37.08 --> 00:56:38.08
Yeah.

1444
00:56:38.08 --> 00:56:40.08
You're, discipline like when you, when you first start saying discipline.

1445
00:56:40.08 --> 00:56:46.08
Oh, when I first started hearing it from you, that was like one of the things that popped into my head, like, as being really obvious.

1446
00:56:46.08 --> 00:56:53.08
Like if you are discipline with your time, you will have a lot of free time, like a lot, a lot of free time.

1447
00:56:53.08 --> 00:56:58.08
Way more than you would think anyway, because, you know, even when I'm like real busy, you know,

1448
00:56:58.08 --> 00:57:02.08
if I can accurately remember my day, I can remember like just like five minutes here,

1449
00:57:02.08 --> 00:57:06.08
15 minutes there, like that I did something that was a waste of time.

1450
00:57:06.08 --> 00:57:09.08
And if you add up all those little minutes, you have probably hours.

1451
00:57:09.08 --> 00:57:12.08
Probably hours for to do whatever.

1452
00:57:12.08 --> 00:57:13.08
Yeah.

1453
00:57:13.08 --> 00:57:20.08
Do something progressive, you know, progressive, progressive, progressive life.

1454
00:57:20.08 --> 00:57:23.08
Value valuable, all those things.

1455
00:57:23.08 --> 00:57:24.08
Check.

1456
00:57:24.08 --> 00:57:25.08
Next question.

1457
00:57:25.08 --> 00:57:34.08
Would your extreme ownership philosophy have changed or lost confidence if you had been relieved of command when taking ownership of friendly fire incident?

1458
00:57:34.08 --> 00:57:36.08
You described being your first book.

1459
00:57:36.08 --> 00:57:39.08
The book, extreme ownership, by the way.

1460
00:57:39.08 --> 00:57:40.08
Yes.

1461
00:57:40.08 --> 00:57:47.08
Just to be perfectly clear about this, I wasn't taking ownership of the situation,

1462
00:57:47.08 --> 00:57:49.08
so that I could keep my job.

1463
00:57:49.08 --> 00:57:54.08
It wasn't a political maneuver to set myself up to look good.

1464
00:57:54.08 --> 00:58:03.08
I was taking ownership of the situation because I was the leader of the situation that took place.

1465
00:58:03.08 --> 00:58:06.08
I was the guy responsible for what was happening.

1466
00:58:06.08 --> 00:58:10.08
I was taking ownership because that was the correct thing.

1467
00:58:10.08 --> 00:58:15.08
The correct thing is something bad and happened and I was in charge of it.

1468
00:58:15.08 --> 00:58:20.08
And yes, I could have been fired.

1469
00:58:20.08 --> 00:58:27.08
And if I would have been fired, I would have accepted it and I wouldn't have done anything different.

1470
00:58:27.08 --> 00:58:32.08
So again, this is sort of similar to a couple of questions ago.

1471
00:58:32.08 --> 00:58:37.08
That extreme ownership is not about avoiding trouble.

1472
00:58:37.08 --> 00:58:38.08
It's not about avoiding trouble.

1473
00:58:38.08 --> 00:58:41.08
You don't say, well, I own it and then you don't get trouble.

1474
00:58:41.08 --> 00:58:44.08
You actually could get fired.

1475
00:58:44.08 --> 00:58:46.08
You actually could get fired.

1476
00:58:46.08 --> 00:58:52.08
And that's why that idea of preemptive ownership.

1477
00:58:52.08 --> 00:58:55.08
I talked about that at one of the monsters.

1478
00:58:55.08 --> 00:58:58.08
If in the back of your mind, if in the back of my mind, I think, you know what?

1479
00:58:58.08 --> 00:59:01.08
If the普通 makes a mistake, I can just blame it on them.

1480
00:59:01.08 --> 00:59:02.08
I'll be good.

1481
00:59:02.08 --> 00:59:05.08
Well, now I'm not really that worried about their plan because I got that little out if I need it.

1482
00:59:05.08 --> 00:59:07.08
I'm not worried about if the guys understand the rules would engage.

1483
00:59:07.08 --> 00:59:09.08
Because I got that a little out if I need it.

1484
00:59:09.08 --> 00:59:12.08
I'm not that worried about deconstruction because I got that little out if they screwed up.

1485
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:14.08
So I haven't out for myself.

1486
00:59:14.08 --> 00:59:23.08
And so I don't really put 100% effort into the planning and of what we're doing.

1487
00:59:23.08 --> 00:59:25.08
If I have preemptive ownership, where is this?

1488
00:59:25.08 --> 00:59:28.08
Hey, no matter what happens out here, it's my fault.

1489
00:59:28.08 --> 00:59:29.08
Guess what?

1490
00:59:29.08 --> 00:59:30.08
Hey, guys, do you understand the RR's?

1491
00:59:30.08 --> 00:59:31.08
Let me talk to you about him.

1492
00:59:31.08 --> 00:59:36.08
Get hey, hey, Dave, do you guys understand where the lines of limits of advance are?

1493
00:59:36.08 --> 00:59:37.08
So you know where you could.

1494
00:59:37.08 --> 00:59:38.08
Just all your guys don't understand.

1495
00:59:38.08 --> 00:59:39.08
Hey, do we see?

1496
00:59:39.08 --> 00:59:40.08
Do we have it marked out clearly?

1497
00:59:40.08 --> 00:59:41.08
Okay, great.

1498
00:59:41.08 --> 00:59:47.08
Hey, do you know, like dig in and when you dig in on stuff, then you have less of a chance of something going wrong.

1499
00:59:47.08 --> 00:59:51.08
But when something does go wrong and you take ownership of it, you take ownership of it.

1500
00:59:51.08 --> 00:59:54.08
Not to avoid trouble, but to face trouble.

1501
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:56.08
Hmm.

1502
00:59:56.08 --> 00:59:58.08
That's what you have to do.

1503
00:59:58.08 --> 01:00:02.08
So my idea hasn't changed.

1504
01:00:02.08 --> 01:00:09.08
In fact, if I would have blamed someone else and then kept my job and someone else got inspired,

1505
01:00:09.08 --> 01:00:13.08
I would have had a real problem with that.

1506
01:00:13.08 --> 01:00:16.08
I could not have lived with myself.

1507
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:21.08
I could not have been able to do that.

1508
01:00:21.08 --> 01:00:24.08
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

1509
01:00:24.08 --> 01:00:29.08
And that's why when I was trying to figure out who the blame it on, because I was, because I was looking at this big problem, because there was a lot of bad things.

1510
01:00:29.08 --> 01:00:34.08
And I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm like, okay, who's fault with this?

1511
01:00:34.08 --> 01:00:45.08
And I couldn't figure out why I didn't feel comfortable saying that.

1512
01:00:45.08 --> 01:00:47.08
Saying it was this guy, was that guy?

1513
01:00:47.08 --> 01:00:51.08
It'd be like this guy in the previous one, because it's Bill's fault.

1514
01:00:51.08 --> 01:00:53.08
I don't feel comfortable saying that.

1515
01:00:53.08 --> 01:00:56.08
Especially when I'm in charge, I don't feel comfortable when I'm a peer either.

1516
01:00:56.08 --> 01:01:02.08
If I'm, if my peer, but we're part of a team and something goes wrong, I don't feel comfortable saying it was the other guy.

1517
01:01:02.08 --> 01:01:03.08
Hmm.

1518
01:01:03.08 --> 01:01:04.08
Who does that?

1519
01:01:04.08 --> 01:01:06.08
Who feels good about that, right?

1520
01:01:06.08 --> 01:01:08.08
Don't be that person.

1521
01:01:08.08 --> 01:01:14.08
And only that when you see people acting that way, everybody can identify that that's a bad thing.

1522
01:01:14.08 --> 01:01:17.08
But they do it anyways, because they're ego.

1523
01:01:17.08 --> 01:01:20.08
So keep it in check.

1524
01:01:20.08 --> 01:01:22.08
Yeah.

1525
01:01:22.08 --> 01:01:24.08
Next question.

1526
01:01:24.08 --> 01:01:28.08
Whether directly or indirectly, I know Jockel follows this principle.

1527
01:01:28.08 --> 01:01:31.08
The way you do anything is the way you do everything.

1528
01:01:31.08 --> 01:01:33.08
This is an intro.

1529
01:01:33.08 --> 01:01:42.08
This question, I had to pull out because what you're going to see, it's very, I think it's a question.

1530
01:01:42.08 --> 01:01:45.08
Maybe you might be even more suited to answer than me.

1531
01:01:45.08 --> 01:01:46.08
We'll go ahead and proceed.

1532
01:01:46.08 --> 01:01:47.08
Interesting.

1533
01:01:47.08 --> 01:01:50.08
Now, let's say you're sitting on the couch.

1534
01:01:50.08 --> 01:01:52.08
And you want to switch the light on.

1535
01:01:52.08 --> 01:01:54.08
The switch is to your right.

1536
01:01:54.08 --> 01:02:00.08
And you know there's a 95% chance that you can reach it from where you're sitting without having to leave the couch.

1537
01:02:00.08 --> 01:02:01.08
What do you do?

1538
01:02:01.08 --> 01:02:06.08
Do you take the chance to reach it or to reach for it in vain?

1539
01:02:06.08 --> 01:02:07.08
And then get up.

1540
01:02:07.08 --> 01:02:09.08
Walk to the switch and turn it on.

1541
01:02:09.08 --> 01:02:19.08
Or do you get up right away and make the extra effort and get it done in the most efficient manner, regardless of if there was potentially an easier way.

1542
01:02:19.08 --> 01:02:20.08
I get you.

1543
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:22.08
I think we know where you sit on this.

1544
01:02:22.08 --> 01:02:26.08
I know I'd love to give some big profound answer about this, but here's the deal.

1545
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:29.08
I would accurately assess the distance of light switch.

1546
01:02:29.08 --> 01:02:30.08
Oh, accurately.

1547
01:02:30.08 --> 01:02:31.08
Accurately.

1548
01:02:31.08 --> 01:02:32.08
Accurately.

1549
01:02:32.08 --> 01:02:34.08
And I'd figure out the best way to turn it on.

1550
01:02:34.08 --> 01:02:35.08
And then I'd turn it on.

1551
01:02:35.08 --> 01:02:37.08
That's what I do.

1552
01:02:37.08 --> 01:02:40.08
I mean, if I got to get up out of that, I'd get to get better, better bed.

1553
01:02:40.08 --> 01:02:42.08
Or I'd pull a pull.

1554
01:02:42.08 --> 01:02:43.08
We on the couch.

1555
01:02:43.08 --> 01:02:45.08
Is that the situation?

1556
01:02:45.08 --> 01:02:47.08
I want to need the light on.

1557
01:02:47.08 --> 01:02:51.08
So yeah, we'll right get the light on my phone out and see what I got to see with the light.

1558
01:02:51.08 --> 01:02:52.08
Oh, you did that right?

1559
01:02:52.08 --> 01:02:55.08
Because I'm thinking out of the box over on my side.

1560
01:02:55.08 --> 01:02:56.08
That's what I'm doing.

1561
01:02:56.08 --> 01:03:00.08
What you do is as far as the as far as the thing the way you do anything is the way you do everything.

1562
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:04.08
It's partly true, but at the same time, guess what you got to prioritize next.

1563
01:03:04.08 --> 01:03:11.08
Next. And there are some things that are not as important as other things.

1564
01:03:11.08 --> 01:03:20.08
My famous example is that my gym floor in my home gym is not clean.

1565
01:03:20.08 --> 01:03:21.08
Yep.

1566
01:03:21.08 --> 01:03:22.08
It's there's chalk on it.

1567
01:03:22.08 --> 01:03:23.08
There's some sweat stains.

1568
01:03:23.08 --> 01:03:32.08
I don't go in there three times a week with a mop and swab it and get all the chalk out and power wash it.

1569
01:03:32.08 --> 01:03:33.08
That's what it would take.

1570
01:03:33.08 --> 01:03:40.08
Maybe two times a week if I power washed it, pull all the stuff out of the garage, power wash the mats, pull them back in there, set the garage back up.

1571
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:43.08
That's what it would take to keep the mats clean.

1572
01:03:43.08 --> 01:03:47.08
That don't care if those mats are cleaner not doesn't matter me.

1573
01:03:47.08 --> 01:03:47.08
Right?

1574
01:03:47.08 --> 01:03:56.08
I have to prioritize there's much, much, much more important things than whether my mats in my garage gym or clean doesn't matter.

1575
01:03:56.08 --> 01:03:57.08
Yeah.

1576
01:03:57.08 --> 01:03:59.08
Did you do mats are different, right?

1577
01:03:59.08 --> 01:04:00.08
Did you do mats got to be clean?

1578
01:04:00.08 --> 01:04:00.08
Yeah.

1579
01:04:00.08 --> 01:04:01.08
Those got to be clean.

1580
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:04.08
Well, there's what we got people clean those mats after classes.

1581
01:04:04.08 --> 01:04:05.08
Sure.

1582
01:04:05.08 --> 01:04:06.08
That's a priority.

1583
01:04:06.08 --> 01:04:09.08
The ones at my house that just me don't matter.

1584
01:04:09.08 --> 01:04:12.08
That doesn't mean that I'm slacking in other areas.

1585
01:04:12.08 --> 01:04:13.08
Right?

1586
01:04:13.08 --> 01:04:17.08
There's a minimum standard in certain things like there's and even my home gym mats.

1587
01:04:17.08 --> 01:04:22.08
I have a vacuum and I hit them with the vacuum when I get too much dog hair on them.

1588
01:04:22.08 --> 01:04:25.08
Which actually I do that like every one or two days.

1589
01:04:25.08 --> 01:04:28.08
It takes three minutes to just vacuum dog hair.

1590
01:04:28.08 --> 01:04:29.08
Right?

1591
01:04:29.08 --> 01:04:32.08
There's a minimum standard to hold the line.

1592
01:04:32.08 --> 01:04:38.08
And as far as doing things the most efficient way, I try to do things the right way.

1593
01:04:38.08 --> 01:04:39.08
Right?

1594
01:04:39.08 --> 01:04:40.08
Trying to do things the right way.

1595
01:04:40.08 --> 01:04:44.08
Which generally that coincides with the most efficient way.

1596
01:04:44.08 --> 01:04:45.08
Generally.

1597
01:04:45.08 --> 01:04:45.08
Generally.

1598
01:04:45.08 --> 01:04:46.08
There are.

1599
01:04:46.08 --> 01:04:48.08
But here, that's what he's talking about here.

1600
01:04:48.08 --> 01:04:50.08
So when you said, I'm a fifth and a fifth and a fifth.

1601
01:04:50.08 --> 01:04:51.08
Here's a thing man.

1602
01:04:51.08 --> 01:04:56.08
Bro, this guy, you don't, we don't have this name but man, we need to get together and talk.

1603
01:04:56.08 --> 01:04:57.08
This is all of this.

1604
01:04:57.08 --> 01:04:59.08
This is kind of stuff that I think about all the time.

1605
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:02.08
Not in this obsessive way but in this end of my mind.

1606
01:05:02.08 --> 01:05:04.08
Man, that's a good question too.

1607
01:05:04.08 --> 01:05:06.08
So basically he's asking like, okay.

1608
01:05:06.08 --> 01:05:08.08
And it happens for literally half a second.

1609
01:05:08.08 --> 01:05:09.08
Maybe one whole second.

1610
01:05:09.08 --> 01:05:11.08
Where like, okay man, I need to light on.

1611
01:05:11.08 --> 01:05:12.08
What do I do?

1612
01:05:12.08 --> 01:05:13.08
Do I?

1613
01:05:13.08 --> 01:05:15.08
You know, like how he said, do I reach for it?

1614
01:05:15.08 --> 01:05:16.08
Because that's the easiest way.

1615
01:05:16.08 --> 01:05:17.08
I don't have to stand up.

1616
01:05:17.08 --> 01:05:20.08
He's on my leg and back muscles and stand up and walk over like just reach for it.

1617
01:05:20.08 --> 01:05:22.08
But if I can't reach it.

1618
01:05:22.08 --> 01:05:24.08
Now I got to do, expand all the energy of reaching for it.

1619
01:05:24.08 --> 01:05:29.08
Failing, bringing my hand back and then doing the standing up thing that I was trying to avoid in the first place.

1620
01:05:29.08 --> 01:05:31.08
So it's one of those things.

1621
01:05:31.08 --> 01:05:32.08
So what do I do man?

1622
01:05:32.08 --> 01:05:33.08
What do I do?

1623
01:05:33.08 --> 01:05:34.08
Do I just chance it?

1624
01:05:34.08 --> 01:05:36.08
Or do I just be like, you know, I'm not going to chance anything.

1625
01:05:36.08 --> 01:05:38.08
I'm just going to expand the energy.

1626
01:05:38.08 --> 01:05:39.08
And turn on the light.

1627
01:05:39.08 --> 01:05:40.08
So what do I do?

1628
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:40.08
Right.

1629
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:41.08
I mean, to conundrum.

1630
01:05:41.08 --> 01:05:43.08
Same thing with the soy sauce posts.

1631
01:05:43.08 --> 01:05:44.08
Same thing.

1632
01:05:44.08 --> 01:05:45.08
Also here's what here's what you might.

1633
01:05:45.08 --> 01:05:47.08
Did you see the meme?

1634
01:05:47.08 --> 01:05:48.08
Yes.

1635
01:05:48.08 --> 01:05:49.08
There's a couple memes.

1636
01:05:49.08 --> 01:05:51.08
There's a couple memes about you in the soy sauce balls.

1637
01:05:51.08 --> 01:05:52.08
I'm fed three.

1638
01:05:52.08 --> 01:05:55.08
One of them was like a black and white photo.

1639
01:05:55.08 --> 01:05:56.08
Did you see that one?

1640
01:05:56.08 --> 01:05:59.08
I was like a black and white photo, but it said something.

1641
01:05:59.08 --> 01:06:03.08
It was a black and white photo of soy sauce balls.

1642
01:06:03.08 --> 01:06:04.08
Oh yeah.

1643
01:06:04.08 --> 01:06:05.08
What did it say?

1644
01:06:05.08 --> 01:06:06.08
I feel like the strawberry.

1645
01:06:06.08 --> 01:06:08.08
The strawberry was better than the strawberry.

1646
01:06:08.08 --> 01:06:09.08
It was better than the strawberry was real.

1647
01:06:09.08 --> 01:06:10.08
Yeah.

1648
01:06:10.08 --> 01:06:12.08
And then they had the superhero looking guy that had the two buttons.

1649
01:06:12.08 --> 01:06:13.08
Yeah.

1650
01:06:13.08 --> 01:06:14.08
The two buttons.

1651
01:06:14.08 --> 01:06:16.08
Anyway, here's one.

1652
01:06:16.08 --> 01:06:19.08
And here's one that this one's a real problem.

1653
01:06:19.08 --> 01:06:21.08
Small but a real problem for those people.

1654
01:06:21.08 --> 01:06:25.08
When you're laying in bed at night, you're sleeping and you wake up.

1655
01:06:25.08 --> 01:06:27.08
You're like, man, I gotta take it.

1656
01:06:27.08 --> 01:06:29.08
I gotta use bathroom.

1657
01:06:29.08 --> 01:06:30.08
But not too bad.

1658
01:06:30.08 --> 01:06:33.08
I don't have to use bathroom bad just a little bit.

1659
01:06:33.08 --> 01:06:34.08
So what do I do?

1660
01:06:34.08 --> 01:06:35.08
Do I hold it?

1661
01:06:35.08 --> 01:06:40.08
Power through the discomfort because this comfort isn't that bad and hopefully I'll fall asleep.

1662
01:06:40.08 --> 01:06:44.08
Because I don't want to get up and wait myself up more and turn on the light and do all this stuff and walk around

1663
01:06:44.08 --> 01:06:47.08
Get the blood flowing and then what if I can't fall asleep as quick or whatever or I'm tired.

1664
01:06:47.08 --> 01:06:49.08
I don't even want to get out of bed.

1665
01:06:49.08 --> 01:06:52.08
You know, so what do I do?

1666
01:06:52.08 --> 01:06:55.08
Because if I go use a bathroom, oh man, I'll be fully relaxed.

1667
01:06:55.08 --> 01:06:56.08
It'll be done.

1668
01:06:56.08 --> 01:06:57.08
It won't keep me up.

1669
01:06:57.08 --> 01:06:58.08
The discomfort won't keep me up.

1670
01:06:58.08 --> 01:07:01.08
But if I can fall back asleep, I didn't even have to get out of bed.

1671
01:07:01.08 --> 01:07:03.08
I'm just saying.

1672
01:07:03.08 --> 01:07:04.08
So what do you do?

1673
01:07:04.08 --> 01:07:05.08
You're at that.

1674
01:07:05.08 --> 01:07:08.08
And if you really got ease about the misno issue, because it's obvious.

1675
01:07:08.08 --> 01:07:11.08
But if you just have to do a little bit, it's a hard question.

1676
01:07:11.08 --> 01:07:13.08
I can't tell you if you're talking about that.

1677
01:07:13.08 --> 01:07:14.08
Don't even act.

1678
01:07:14.08 --> 01:07:15.08
I know.

1679
01:07:15.08 --> 01:07:16.08
What do you mean?

1680
01:07:16.08 --> 01:07:17.08
I just said that you had problems.

1681
01:07:17.08 --> 01:07:19.08
I've been zero seconds.

1682
01:07:19.08 --> 01:07:21.08
I spend zero seconds thinking about that issue.

1683
01:07:21.08 --> 01:07:22.08
Zero.

1684
01:07:22.08 --> 01:07:24.08
This is no factor whatsoever in my life.

1685
01:07:24.08 --> 01:07:26.08
I'm going to go use bathroom.

1686
01:07:26.08 --> 01:07:29.08
Here's my answer to your question.

1687
01:07:29.08 --> 01:07:30.08
If I have to go to the bathroom, I go to the bathroom.

1688
01:07:30.08 --> 01:07:32.08
What if you kind of have to go to the bathroom?

1689
01:07:32.08 --> 01:07:33.08
There's no kind of thing.

1690
01:07:33.08 --> 01:07:34.08
There's no kind of thing.

1691
01:07:34.08 --> 01:07:35.08
There's no kind of thing.

1692
01:07:35.08 --> 01:07:36.08
I don't want to know.

1693
01:07:36.08 --> 01:07:38.08
Your back is like, if your bladder is full.

1694
01:07:38.08 --> 01:07:39.08
Okay, you got ease about the point.

1695
01:07:39.08 --> 01:07:40.08
What if your bladder is one-third full?

1696
01:07:40.08 --> 01:07:42.08
Then I don't have to go to the bathroom.

1697
01:07:42.08 --> 01:07:46.08
Okay, so you have a distinct cut off then in feelings.

1698
01:07:46.08 --> 01:07:47.08
You don't have that great answer.

1699
01:07:47.08 --> 01:07:48.08
You have that great answer.

1700
01:07:48.08 --> 01:07:49.08
I don't.

1701
01:07:49.08 --> 01:07:50.08
Alright.

1702
01:07:50.08 --> 01:07:51.08
So most of us, we don't have to like that.

1703
01:07:51.08 --> 01:07:52.08
No.

1704
01:07:52.08 --> 01:07:53.08
We've got to like consider.

1705
01:07:53.08 --> 01:07:54.08
No.

1706
01:07:54.08 --> 01:07:56.08
Well the same way that this kind of has to go with.

1707
01:07:56.08 --> 01:07:57.08
No, no, no, no.

1708
01:07:57.08 --> 01:07:58.08
Anyway.

1709
01:07:58.08 --> 01:07:59.08
Anyway.

1710
01:07:59.08 --> 01:08:00.08
I dig it.

1711
01:08:00.08 --> 01:08:03.08
And that's going to be one of those ongoing challenges.

1712
01:08:03.08 --> 01:08:04.08
I think.

1713
01:08:04.08 --> 01:08:05.08
You know?

1714
01:08:05.08 --> 01:08:06.08
I think the main.

1715
01:08:06.08 --> 01:08:09.08
And I almost left that whole second half of the question because the main point

1716
01:08:09.08 --> 01:08:12.08
of the question was the way you do anything is the way you do everything.

1717
01:08:12.08 --> 01:08:13.08
Yes, that's true to a point.

1718
01:08:13.08 --> 01:08:15.08
You should definitely keep, you know.

1719
01:08:15.08 --> 01:08:19.08
You're trying to maintain consistent effort and hold the line and everything.

1720
01:08:19.08 --> 01:08:23.08
But the economy is that if you try and hold the line on every single thing that's not possible

1721
01:08:23.08 --> 01:08:27.08
and you'd spend your whole life cleaning up everything around you and fixing things.

1722
01:08:27.08 --> 01:08:28.08
Yeah.

1723
01:08:28.08 --> 01:08:32.08
What you just, the univ wasting time when you have, you need to prioritize and execute.

1724
01:08:32.08 --> 01:08:33.08
Pick the biggest problems.

1725
01:08:33.08 --> 01:08:35.08
Pick the biggest things you're going to have the most impact on you.

1726
01:08:35.08 --> 01:08:39.08
And then focus on those things and don't worry about some other things.

1727
01:08:39.08 --> 01:08:40.08
Yeah.

1728
01:08:40.08 --> 01:08:42.08
And that's that little conundrum is everywhere.

1729
01:08:42.08 --> 01:08:45.08
But sometimes it'll be vacuuming.

1730
01:08:45.08 --> 01:08:47.08
And then you know how like when you vacuum over like I don't know,

1731
01:08:47.08 --> 01:08:49.08
let's say it's a big piece of land.

1732
01:08:49.08 --> 01:08:51.08
You go over the vacuum once, you know.

1733
01:08:51.08 --> 01:08:52.08
And it doesn't go in.

1734
01:08:52.08 --> 01:08:53.08
You go again.

1735
01:08:53.08 --> 01:08:54.08
It doesn't go in.

1736
01:08:54.08 --> 01:08:57.08
You go, I could have picked that thing up like three, four seconds ago.

1737
01:08:57.08 --> 01:08:58.08
So why didn't you?

1738
01:08:58.08 --> 01:09:02.08
Because I thought I could have, I should get a guy with a vacuum and I wouldn't have to bend down.

1739
01:09:02.08 --> 01:09:03.08
You know what I mean?

1740
01:09:03.08 --> 01:09:04.08
It's like that kind of stuff.

1741
01:09:04.08 --> 01:09:05.08
It depends on the time.

1742
01:09:05.08 --> 01:09:06.08
It's all the time.

1743
01:09:06.08 --> 01:09:07.08
It's a lot of things.

1744
01:09:07.08 --> 01:09:09.08
It's efficiency, not laziness.

1745
01:09:09.08 --> 01:09:10.08
But either way, you know what though?

1746
01:09:10.08 --> 01:09:15.08
It's got you combined with this guy's question and answered the question with how you do everything.

1747
01:09:15.08 --> 01:09:16.08
You just establish a protocol.

1748
01:09:16.08 --> 01:09:18.08
If there's a question, you just do the guaranteed one.

1749
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:21.08
If I see a piece of the land, I'm a vacuum it.

1750
01:09:21.08 --> 01:09:22.08
It didn't go up, boom, pick it up.

1751
01:09:22.08 --> 01:09:23.08
That's it.

1752
01:09:23.08 --> 01:09:25.08
Maybe you get a double take, right?

1753
01:09:25.08 --> 01:09:26.08
Yeah.

1754
01:09:26.08 --> 01:09:28.08
Because generally you got to go forward and back on a vacuum anyways.

1755
01:09:28.08 --> 01:09:29.08
You know what I'm saying?

1756
01:09:29.08 --> 01:09:30.08
You just rerun that same track.

1757
01:09:30.08 --> 01:09:31.08
Yeah.

1758
01:09:31.08 --> 01:09:35.08
Because you know you're going forward back, but you're offsetting a little bit.

1759
01:09:35.08 --> 01:09:36.08
Yeah.

1760
01:09:36.08 --> 01:09:38.08
And sometimes the back depending on your brush, depending on the back one or the back one.

1761
01:09:38.08 --> 01:09:40.08
Sometimes it's more powerful.

1762
01:09:40.08 --> 01:09:41.08
Okay.

1763
01:09:41.08 --> 01:09:42.08
Because the brush spins a certain way.

1764
01:09:42.08 --> 01:09:43.08
Interesting.

1765
01:09:43.08 --> 01:09:44.08
But either way, yeah.

1766
01:09:44.08 --> 01:09:45.08
But either way you feed.

1767
01:09:45.08 --> 01:09:46.08
Okay.

1768
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:47.08
And then guess what?

1769
01:09:47.08 --> 01:09:51.08
On the forward stroke, you can go now to your next track and you can bend down grab the

1770
01:09:51.08 --> 01:09:52.08
piece of land.

1771
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:53.08
You're good to go.

1772
01:09:53.08 --> 01:09:54.08
Yeah.

1773
01:09:54.08 --> 01:09:56.08
So then the point is establish a protocol where it's like, you know what?

1774
01:09:56.08 --> 01:09:57.08
I'm not going to waste my time.

1775
01:09:57.08 --> 01:09:58.08
No.

1776
01:09:58.08 --> 01:09:59.08
You know, risking it and all this stuff.

1777
01:09:59.08 --> 01:10:02.08
I'm just going to go for the real deal.

1778
01:10:02.08 --> 01:10:04.08
Pop them.

1779
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:05.08
Oh, yeah.

1780
01:10:05.08 --> 01:10:06.08
You know what?

1781
01:10:06.08 --> 01:10:07.08
All right.

1782
01:10:07.08 --> 01:10:12.08
So I'm a firefighter slash EMT, a recently and recently I went on a call where a patient

1783
01:10:12.08 --> 01:10:13.08
didn't live.

1784
01:10:13.08 --> 01:10:15.08
Not unusual by any means.

1785
01:10:15.08 --> 01:10:19.08
Unfortunately, I deal with loss of life on almost a daily basis.

1786
01:10:19.08 --> 01:10:23.08
I detached and do my job always working to get better.

1787
01:10:23.08 --> 01:10:25.08
This call, I failed to detach.

1788
01:10:25.08 --> 01:10:26.08
It hit me hard.

1789
01:10:26.08 --> 01:10:31.08
When the patient's husband let out a chilling, let out chilling screams.

1790
01:10:31.08 --> 01:10:37.08
As his third year old wife went from alert and talking to dead within minutes.

1791
01:10:37.08 --> 01:10:40.08
I let myself enter into his shoes at that moment.

1792
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:44.08
I got over it quick during my days off and moved on.

1793
01:10:44.08 --> 01:10:46.08
It's part of the job and I accept that.

1794
01:10:46.08 --> 01:10:50.08
But my question is, when does it become inhumane to detach?

1795
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:55.08
Do we sometimes need to let some weakness through to remain grounded when dealing with such

1796
01:10:55.08 --> 01:10:58.08
major incidents is loss of life?

1797
01:10:58.08 --> 01:10:59.08
Thank you.

1798
01:10:59.08 --> 01:11:02.08
Okay.

1799
01:11:02.08 --> 01:11:05.08
First of all, sympathy and empathy are not weaknesses.

1800
01:11:05.08 --> 01:11:07.08
They're not weaknesses.

1801
01:11:07.08 --> 01:11:14.08
In fact, it actually takes strength to be able to deal with these types of situations

1802
01:11:14.08 --> 01:11:16.08
and these types of emotions.

1803
01:11:16.08 --> 01:11:22.08
The weak move would actually be to cut those emotions off completely.

1804
01:11:22.08 --> 01:11:31.08
So that being said, as you know, obviously there is a dichotomy.

1805
01:11:31.08 --> 01:11:35.08
Because you cannot let the emotions overwhelm you.

1806
01:11:35.08 --> 01:11:40.08
As a matter of fact, if you get overwhelmed by your feelings,

1807
01:11:40.08 --> 01:11:45.08
then you can't do your job properly, which in its own right is inhumane.

1808
01:11:45.08 --> 01:11:48.08
Because now you're not able to treat the patients that you're trying to save.

1809
01:11:48.08 --> 01:11:50.08
Because you're getting too emotional about it.

1810
01:11:50.08 --> 01:11:54.08
So what do you have to do? The answer for the millionth time of a different subject,

1811
01:11:54.08 --> 01:11:56.08
but comes up all the time, you've got to find balance.

1812
01:11:56.08 --> 01:12:00.08
You have to find balance between being emotional enough,

1813
01:12:00.08 --> 01:12:07.08
but not being too emotional. You have to learn to recognize if you're going too far in one direction.

1814
01:12:07.08 --> 01:12:09.08
Or the other, you have to do a self-assessment.

1815
01:12:09.08 --> 01:12:17.08
You have to look and see and make sure that that you see the people you're treating as people.

1816
01:12:17.08 --> 01:12:20.08
You have to look at them and make sure that you're seeing them as people.

1817
01:12:20.08 --> 01:12:23.08
That you're not seeing them as a hunk of meat, right?

1818
01:12:23.08 --> 01:12:26.08
You have to do that. You have to make sure that you're doing that.

1819
01:12:26.08 --> 01:12:35.08
At the same time, you cannot afford emotionally to go through the pain of loss every time you see someone die.

1820
01:12:35.08 --> 01:12:40.08
Because that's also going to be a problem. You can't afford emotionally to do that.

1821
01:12:40.08 --> 01:12:46.08
You can't go through that pain over and over and over again.

1822
01:12:46.08 --> 01:12:54.08
So you have to, like you said, you have to detach and normally do a good job with that.

1823
01:12:54.08 --> 01:12:57.08
Obviously, you guys get wounded.

1824
01:12:57.08 --> 01:13:00.08
I've seen guys get killed. I've been around a lot of death.

1825
01:13:00.08 --> 01:13:05.08
And when it was around me, I didn't have time to stop and think about it.

1826
01:13:05.08 --> 01:13:09.08
I had to work to do. I had to detach myself and do my job.

1827
01:13:09.08 --> 01:13:14.08
At the same time, when it's over and the time was appropriate,

1828
01:13:14.08 --> 01:13:22.08
it's like you've got to connect with what happened and make sure that you are dealing with it appropriately.

1829
01:13:22.08 --> 01:13:28.08
And I always think firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and police and military,

1830
01:13:28.08 --> 01:13:35.08
but paramedics and EMTs, you're only showing up if someone isn't a bad way.

1831
01:13:35.08 --> 01:13:40.08
And I know that's hard physically and it's hard mentally and it's hard emotionally.

1832
01:13:40.08 --> 01:13:49.08
So find a balance, keep yourself balanced, make sure you're not going too far in one direction or the other.

1833
01:13:49.08 --> 01:13:53.08
And thanks for doing your job.

1834
01:13:53.08 --> 01:13:59.08
Man, that's like easy, but sometimes you forget that about EMTs.

1835
01:13:59.08 --> 01:14:03.08
Like that's the only time where they spread.

1836
01:14:03.08 --> 01:14:04.08
I mean, pretty much.

1837
01:14:04.08 --> 01:14:07.08
Yeah, EMTs are getting called because someone is in a bad way.

1838
01:14:07.08 --> 01:14:08.08
That's the whole thing.

1839
01:14:08.08 --> 01:14:10.08
What they're showing up for.

1840
01:14:10.08 --> 01:14:12.08
And cops too.

1841
01:14:12.08 --> 01:14:19.08
It's easy to be on the outside when you're going to parks and if your job is like,

1842
01:14:19.08 --> 01:14:24.08
I don't know, I press record, make videos or whatever.

1843
01:14:24.08 --> 01:14:26.08
And this is like every day.

1844
01:14:26.08 --> 01:14:30.08
So it kind of forms this vision, my world, whatever.

1845
01:14:30.08 --> 01:14:32.08
But EMTs.

1846
01:14:32.08 --> 01:14:36.08
And every time you get to call it, it's just the question is just,

1847
01:14:36.08 --> 01:14:38.08
Oh, how bad.

1848
01:14:38.08 --> 01:14:44.08
You know, that's what it is, how bad, how bad of a situation is the person I'm about to go content with.

1849
01:14:44.08 --> 01:14:46.08
What's their situation?

1850
01:14:46.08 --> 01:14:51.08
They are, they could be everything from a minor situation to they're going to die in front of me.

1851
01:14:51.08 --> 01:14:56.08
Again, this new person, and their life and their kids and their family.

1852
01:14:56.08 --> 01:15:02.08
And you know, Peter T. talked about some of that becoming a bit jaded.

1853
01:15:02.08 --> 01:15:08.08
In fact, it's a pretty horrific story and it's worth listening to that podcast when he was on.

1854
01:15:08.08 --> 01:15:15.08
He talked about how he got to a point where some patients he started to look at like,

1855
01:15:15.08 --> 01:15:18.08
He'd be mad at them, mad at them.

1856
01:15:18.08 --> 01:15:23.08
And that's what you have to avoid is getting to this point.

1857
01:15:23.08 --> 01:15:30.08
You got to do your best to stay emotionally detached enough that you can do your job.

1858
01:15:30.08 --> 01:15:38.08
But at the same time, you can't be looking at other human beings as if they're just a piece of meat.

1859
01:15:38.08 --> 01:15:42.08
So, part job.

1860
01:15:42.08 --> 01:15:47.08
I think we got time for one more question.

1861
01:15:47.08 --> 01:15:51.08
I have good ideas, but I have trouble executing.

1862
01:15:51.08 --> 01:15:56.08
Do you have any tips?

1863
01:15:56.08 --> 01:16:01.08
I have good ideas, but I have trouble executing.

1864
01:16:01.08 --> 01:16:06.08
Do you have any tips?

1865
01:16:06.08 --> 01:16:11.08
Oh yeah.

1866
01:16:11.08 --> 01:16:16.08
You have some good ideas, do you?

1867
01:16:16.08 --> 01:16:19.08
But you can't execute.

1868
01:16:19.08 --> 01:16:25.08
You want to know what those ideas are worth?

1869
01:16:25.08 --> 01:16:29.08
There's nothing.

1870
01:16:29.08 --> 01:16:39.08
Ideas by themselves have zero value unless they can be brought to life.

1871
01:16:39.08 --> 01:16:46.08
And I have known plenty of people with plenty of ideas over the years.

1872
01:16:46.08 --> 01:16:47.08
Great ideas.

1873
01:16:47.08 --> 01:16:49.08
Amazing ideas.

1874
01:16:49.08 --> 01:16:57.08
But very few people can actually turn ideas into action.

1875
01:16:57.08 --> 01:17:04.08
And those people end up old and bitter and angry because they didn't execute their great ideas.

1876
01:17:04.08 --> 01:17:06.08
And so here's what you do.

1877
01:17:06.08 --> 01:17:09.08
You execute.

1878
01:17:09.08 --> 01:17:12.08
You actually make things happen.

1879
01:17:12.08 --> 01:17:16.08
And sometimes I'm going to tell you when you execute your idea,

1880
01:17:16.08 --> 01:17:21.08
it reveals the fact that your idea isn't all that good.

1881
01:17:21.08 --> 01:17:24.08
It's not the brilliant idea you thought it was.

1882
01:17:24.08 --> 01:17:26.08
And some people are actually afraid of that.

1883
01:17:26.08 --> 01:17:28.08
And that's what stops them.

1884
01:17:28.08 --> 01:17:30.08
But I'm not afraid.

1885
01:17:30.08 --> 01:17:33.08
I say, but bring on that failure.

1886
01:17:33.08 --> 01:17:38.08
Let me learn that my idea is no good.

1887
01:17:38.08 --> 01:17:42.08
Because even if you learn that your idea is garbage,

1888
01:17:42.08 --> 01:17:47.08
you know not to waste any more time dreaming about it or thinking about it.

1889
01:17:47.08 --> 01:17:50.08
Go on to your next idea.

1890
01:17:50.08 --> 01:17:55.08
But don't let these ideas just wander aimlessly around in your head.

1891
01:17:55.08 --> 01:17:58.08
Get them out.

1892
01:17:58.08 --> 01:18:02.08
Bring them to life, put them into the world, run with them.

1893
01:18:02.08 --> 01:18:06.08
And get some friends and family or partners.

1894
01:18:06.08 --> 01:18:07.08
Someone to help you.

1895
01:18:07.08 --> 01:18:10.08
Maybe get some people that are better at execution than you are.

1896
01:18:10.08 --> 01:18:12.08
And give them some ownership.

1897
01:18:12.08 --> 01:18:13.08
Give away those ideas.

1898
01:18:13.08 --> 01:18:18.08
It's better to give away those ideas than let them rot inside your head and die.

1899
01:18:22.08 --> 01:18:29.08
And whatever path you take, whether you force yourself to execute or you bring people into help you,

1900
01:18:29.08 --> 01:18:31.08
whatever path you're going to take, do it.

1901
01:18:31.08 --> 01:18:32.08
Do it.

1902
01:18:32.08 --> 01:18:36.08
Pour some life into your idea.

1903
01:18:36.08 --> 01:18:47.08
And like I said, you've got to remember that there's no guarantee that when you pour life into idea,

1904
01:18:47.08 --> 01:18:52.08
into an idea, there's no guarantee that that idea is going to come to life too.

1905
01:18:52.08 --> 01:18:57.08
You might pour everything you've got to that idea and it can still die.

1906
01:18:57.08 --> 01:19:02.08
And you might have to let it die.

1907
01:19:02.08 --> 01:19:07.08
You have to let the dream die because some ideas aren't good enough to live.

1908
01:19:07.08 --> 01:19:08.08
That's just the way it is.

1909
01:19:08.08 --> 01:19:11.08
But you know what?

1910
01:19:11.08 --> 01:19:15.08
At least give it a chance.

1911
01:19:15.08 --> 01:19:19.08
Don't let that idea die inside your head.

1912
01:19:19.08 --> 01:19:27.08
No more waiting, no more putting it off or waiting for the right time or the right people or the right alignment of things in the world.

1913
01:19:27.08 --> 01:19:34.08
No more of that, no more excuses, just execution.

1914
01:19:34.08 --> 01:19:43.08
Just go and make it happen.

1915
01:19:43.08 --> 01:19:49.08
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1916
01:19:49.08 --> 01:19:56.08
So echo Charlie while we are over here trying to make things happen.

1917
01:19:56.08 --> 01:19:59.08
So we have to go hard.

1918
01:19:59.08 --> 01:20:00.08
We have to execute.

1919
01:20:00.08 --> 01:20:04.08
You got anything that could possibly help us execute.

1920
01:20:04.08 --> 01:20:05.08
Yeah.

1921
01:20:05.08 --> 01:20:06.08
Our mission.

1922
01:20:06.08 --> 01:20:07.08
Sure.

1923
01:20:07.08 --> 01:20:09.08
Where do you go?

1924
01:20:09.08 --> 01:20:11.08
Well, talk about origin first.

1925
01:20:11.08 --> 01:20:17.08
This is an outstanding way to execute and maintain the execution.

1926
01:20:17.08 --> 01:20:24.08
So while we are doing you just to and you don't know what kind of get it yet, which would be crazy.

1927
01:20:24.08 --> 01:20:27.08
But hey, people are starting every day.

1928
01:20:27.08 --> 01:20:29.08
And when you start you do have that question.

1929
01:20:29.08 --> 01:20:30.08
Most of the time.

1930
01:20:30.08 --> 01:20:33.08
What's the maximum age for starting GJ2?

1931
01:20:33.08 --> 01:20:34.08
Death.

1932
01:20:34.08 --> 01:20:36.08
I think it's the day before you die.

1933
01:20:36.08 --> 01:20:38.08
The day before that could be 100, whatever.

1934
01:20:38.08 --> 01:20:39.08
Yeah.

1935
01:20:39.08 --> 01:20:44.08
The reason you don't start the day before you die is you don't want to go to your deathbed with regret.

1936
01:20:44.08 --> 01:20:47.08
Because as soon as you even learn a little bit of GJ2, you be like dang.

1937
01:20:47.08 --> 01:20:49.08
I wish I would have started that a month ago.

1938
01:20:49.08 --> 01:20:50.08
Yes.

1939
01:20:50.08 --> 01:20:55.08
Month of solid GJ2.

1940
01:20:55.08 --> 01:20:56.08
Yeah.

1941
01:20:56.08 --> 01:20:57.08
Yeah.

1942
01:20:57.08 --> 01:20:58.08
So yeah.

1943
01:20:58.08 --> 01:21:03.08
We have people all the time starting GJ2 all ages from four or five.

1944
01:21:03.08 --> 01:21:05.08
Below that, yes, you should be training.

1945
01:21:05.08 --> 01:21:06.08
Your little kids should be trained GJ2.

1946
01:21:06.08 --> 01:21:09.08
But it's more of a playful thing that you do with them because you know the techniques.

1947
01:21:09.08 --> 01:21:11.08
And you have them escape the mountain.

1948
01:21:11.08 --> 01:21:12.08
You start to have them arm lock you.

1949
01:21:12.08 --> 01:21:14.08
You start to have them put in that rear naked choke.

1950
01:21:14.08 --> 01:21:17.08
You got to make sure you tell them that the rear naked choke is dangerous and not to do it.

1951
01:21:17.08 --> 01:21:20.08
If you're not around because that is actually a scary thing.

1952
01:21:20.08 --> 01:21:24.08
I used to be a little bit nervous about that when my kids were real little.

1953
01:21:24.08 --> 01:21:25.08
Yeah.

1954
01:21:25.08 --> 01:21:26.08
They know how to rear naked choke.

1955
01:21:26.08 --> 01:21:32.08
You know, oh, maybe my five year old daughter slaps a rear naked choke on my two year old son.

1956
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:33.08
Right.

1957
01:21:33.08 --> 01:21:37.08
And decides, you know, to hang onto that thing because he's crying or whatever.

1958
01:21:37.08 --> 01:21:40.08
So you got to be very careful with that.

1959
01:21:40.08 --> 01:21:41.08
Yeah.

1960
01:21:41.08 --> 01:21:42.08
Yeah.

1961
01:21:42.08 --> 01:21:46.08
And that's a simple deal where it's not like a knife or something.

1962
01:21:46.08 --> 01:21:48.08
Or something where it's like, hey, this is dangerous.

1963
01:21:48.08 --> 01:21:52.08
Don't you know, it's like, it's a little bit more cut in dry with the rear naked choke.

1964
01:21:52.08 --> 01:22:01.08
It's kind of like, okay, you have to deliberately apply the choke and execute the choke for it to be dangerous.

1965
01:22:01.08 --> 01:22:03.08
Not like a knife or something.

1966
01:22:03.08 --> 01:22:06.08
If you got little tiny kids below the, like,

1967
01:22:06.08 --> 01:22:11.08
For two, three, four, five, yes, you teach them basic moves.

1968
01:22:11.08 --> 01:22:15.08
You need to explain to them that the moves are real.

1969
01:22:15.08 --> 01:22:16.08
Yeah.

1970
01:22:16.08 --> 01:22:18.08
And they do work.

1971
01:22:18.08 --> 01:22:23.08
And that's I always warn the little kids about the ones kids are a little bit older than they understand.

1972
01:22:23.08 --> 01:22:25.08
Because it happens them and they know what's going on.

1973
01:22:25.08 --> 01:22:31.08
So be careful with that part of Jiu Jitsu for the little kids, but whether kids are.

1974
01:22:31.08 --> 01:22:36.08
For or whether you're 60 or 70 or 80 years old, go get your Jiu Jitsu on.

1975
01:22:36.08 --> 01:22:38.08
Going to need a G.

1976
01:22:38.08 --> 01:22:40.08
The G and or a Rascart action or Rascart.

1977
01:22:40.08 --> 01:22:41.08
And the Rascart.

1978
01:22:41.08 --> 01:22:42.08
At least one.

1979
01:22:42.08 --> 01:22:44.08
So what kind of G, origin, G.

1980
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:45.08
Planeted choose from.

1981
01:22:45.08 --> 01:22:46.08
Planeted choose from.

1982
01:22:46.08 --> 01:22:47.08
Planeted.

1983
01:22:47.08 --> 01:22:49.08
Increasing by the as time goes on.

1984
01:22:49.08 --> 01:22:50.08
Straight up.

1985
01:22:50.08 --> 01:22:52.08
All made in America.

1986
01:22:52.08 --> 01:22:55.08
And factually the besties in the world.

1987
01:22:55.08 --> 01:22:56.08
Yeah.

1988
01:22:56.08 --> 01:23:01.08
And when you buy an origin G, you are.

1989
01:23:01.08 --> 01:23:08.08
You are investing not only in yourself, but you're also investing in this great country.

1990
01:23:08.08 --> 01:23:15.08
As we rebuild manufacturing inside our country, bringing back the old New England factories

1991
01:23:15.08 --> 01:23:17.08
that they sent overseas.

1992
01:23:17.08 --> 01:23:18.08
We're bringing it back.

1993
01:23:18.08 --> 01:23:20.08
We're actually bringing it back.

1994
01:23:20.08 --> 01:23:21.08
We are.

1995
01:23:21.08 --> 01:23:24.08
We're buying equipment back from overseas.

1996
01:23:24.08 --> 01:23:26.08
Bringing it back here on ships.

1997
01:23:26.08 --> 01:23:28.08
Can you imagine that's happening right now?

1998
01:23:28.08 --> 01:23:29.08
We are doing that.

1999
01:23:29.08 --> 01:23:30.08
You are doing that.

2000
01:23:30.08 --> 01:23:32.08
You are making that happen.

2001
01:23:32.08 --> 01:23:33.08
Also.

2002
01:23:33.08 --> 01:23:34.08
We got jeans.

2003
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:36.08
Here's the deal.

2004
01:23:36.08 --> 01:23:37.08
I talked to Pete.

2005
01:23:37.08 --> 01:23:38.08
Pete Roberts.

2006
01:23:38.08 --> 01:23:39.08
Origin.

2007
01:23:39.08 --> 01:23:42.08
I said, Pete, how many people do you know the dude, G, G, G, G?

2008
01:23:42.08 --> 01:23:45.08
And he's like, oh, 100.

2009
01:23:45.08 --> 01:23:48.08
I said, how many people do you know that own pair of jeans?

2010
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:51.08
And he said, 200 million.

2011
01:23:51.08 --> 01:23:54.08
I said, we need to make jeans.

2012
01:23:54.08 --> 01:23:55.08
Everyone wants jeans.

2013
01:23:55.08 --> 01:23:56.08
Everyone needs jeans.

2014
01:23:56.08 --> 01:24:03.08
Everyone would want jeans that are not only high quality, but also made in America.

2015
01:24:03.08 --> 01:24:07.08
They're sold by craftsmen in Maine.

2016
01:24:07.08 --> 01:24:11.08
So, yeah, we got Origin jeans.

2017
01:24:11.08 --> 01:24:12.08
They're awesome.

2018
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:13.08
We got American denim.

2019
01:24:13.08 --> 01:24:15.08
American denim.

2020
01:24:15.08 --> 01:24:16.08
Like it.

2021
01:24:16.08 --> 01:24:17.08
Cotton cotton.

2022
01:24:17.08 --> 01:24:18.08
Cotton yes.

2023
01:24:18.08 --> 01:24:19.08
Yeah, sewn here.

2024
01:24:19.08 --> 01:24:20.08
Later jean.

2025
01:24:20.08 --> 01:24:21.08
So is it grown?

2026
01:24:21.08 --> 01:24:22.08
There you go.

2027
01:24:22.08 --> 01:24:24.08
I was probably Pete Roberts had come up with that one.

2028
01:24:24.08 --> 01:24:25.08
Yeah.

2029
01:24:25.08 --> 01:24:26.08
A grown and so on in America.

2030
01:24:26.08 --> 01:24:27.08
Baby.

2031
01:24:27.08 --> 01:24:28.08
Boom.

2032
01:24:28.08 --> 01:24:29.08
There it is.

2033
01:24:29.08 --> 01:24:30.08
But also joggers.

2034
01:24:30.08 --> 01:24:31.08
Speaking of pants.

2035
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:40.08
You're not allowed to do joggers, but for us who like comfort and functionality.

2036
01:24:40.08 --> 01:24:43.08
Maybe a twist to style, whatever this one is.

2037
01:24:43.08 --> 01:24:46.08
Why don't we keep bringing up joggers specifically?

2038
01:24:46.08 --> 01:24:48.08
Is it because of my experience with the joggers?

2039
01:24:48.08 --> 01:24:49.08
I like the joggers.

2040
01:24:49.08 --> 01:24:50.08
People like joggers.

2041
01:24:50.08 --> 01:24:51.08
And you can also get supplements.

2042
01:24:51.08 --> 01:24:52.08
We have supplements.

2043
01:24:52.08 --> 01:24:53.08
We have joint warfare.

2044
01:24:53.08 --> 01:24:54.08
We have acrylic.

2045
01:24:54.08 --> 01:24:55.08
We have discipline.

2046
01:24:55.08 --> 01:24:56.08
We have discipline.

2047
01:24:56.08 --> 01:24:57.08
Go.

2048
01:24:57.08 --> 01:24:58.08
According to JP D'Nell.

2049
01:24:58.08 --> 01:25:03.08
When he takes discipline go, he can see people's thoughts.

2050
01:25:03.08 --> 01:25:04.08
Yeah.

2051
01:25:04.08 --> 01:25:07.08
I'm like, he was so fired up.

2052
01:25:07.08 --> 01:25:09.08
He did a, you know, an event for us long front.

2053
01:25:09.08 --> 01:25:11.08
He's like, he's like, I was so fired up.

2054
01:25:11.08 --> 01:25:12.08
I could see people's thoughts.

2055
01:25:12.08 --> 01:25:14.08
And I'm like, I like the way that sounds.

2056
01:25:14.08 --> 01:25:15.08
So discipline go.

2057
01:25:15.08 --> 01:25:19.08
Little new trophic to get the mind kicking.

2058
01:25:19.08 --> 01:25:21.08
And then you got discipline for pre-workout.

2059
01:25:21.08 --> 01:25:22.08
Crayloil.

2060
01:25:22.08 --> 01:25:23.08
Joy warfare.

2061
01:25:23.08 --> 01:25:25.08
Keep the bones.

2062
01:25:25.08 --> 01:25:26.08
The tendons.

2063
01:25:26.08 --> 01:25:27.08
Legiments.

2064
01:25:27.08 --> 01:25:27.08
Legiments.

2065
01:25:27.08 --> 01:25:29.08
Keep all that stuff.

2066
01:25:29.08 --> 01:25:30.08
Good to go.

2067
01:25:30.08 --> 01:25:31.08
Maintained.

2068
01:25:31.08 --> 01:25:32.08
Uninflation.

2069
01:25:32.08 --> 01:25:33.08
So there's inflammation.

2070
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:35.08
What's the anti-inflammation?

2071
01:25:35.08 --> 01:25:37.08
So keep them anti-inflammed.

2072
01:25:37.08 --> 01:25:38.08
Keep them moving.

2073
01:25:38.08 --> 01:25:39.08
Keep them lubricated.

2074
01:25:39.08 --> 01:25:41.08
Keep them functioning.

2075
01:25:41.08 --> 01:25:42.08
Very important.

2076
01:25:42.08 --> 01:25:43.08
And in milk.

2077
01:25:43.08 --> 01:25:44.08
We got milk.

2078
01:25:44.08 --> 01:25:47.08
Some people don't even know what milk is.

2079
01:25:47.08 --> 01:25:49.08
And it's really easy to explain.

2080
01:25:49.08 --> 01:25:50.08
Milk is milk.

2081
01:25:50.08 --> 01:25:51.08
Yeah.

2082
01:25:51.08 --> 01:25:55.08
It happens to have what 22 grams of protein in there.

2083
01:25:55.08 --> 01:25:56.08
Yeah.

2084
01:25:56.08 --> 01:25:57.08
And protein.

2085
01:25:57.08 --> 01:25:58.08
Two by the way.

2086
01:25:58.08 --> 01:25:59.08
Which is different.

2087
01:25:59.08 --> 01:26:00.08
You know?

2088
01:26:00.08 --> 01:26:01.08
And it's delicious.

2089
01:26:01.08 --> 01:26:02.08
You have very delicious.

2090
01:26:02.08 --> 01:26:04.08
And that was, I'll talk to my friend Kenny.

2091
01:26:04.08 --> 01:26:05.08
The other day.

2092
01:26:05.08 --> 01:26:06.08
He's like, oh yeah.

2093
01:26:06.08 --> 01:26:08.08
So we're all doing two special about this thing.

2094
01:26:08.08 --> 01:26:10.08
And I got past a detached, you know.

2095
01:26:10.08 --> 01:26:12.08
I got past your emotional effort.

2096
01:26:12.08 --> 01:26:13.08
A little bit emotional.

2097
01:26:13.08 --> 01:26:16.08
But I was like, I started like going into this whole pitch to my friend.

2098
01:26:16.08 --> 01:26:18.08
By the way, it turned out to be a pitch.

2099
01:26:18.08 --> 01:26:20.08
But just like how it's all clean.

2100
01:26:20.08 --> 01:26:22.08
And we, you know, monk fruit to sweeten it.

2101
01:26:22.08 --> 01:26:24.08
And it's like, doesn't taste like some diet.

2102
01:26:24.08 --> 01:26:26.08
I think whatever's like a dessert at the end of the day.

2103
01:26:26.08 --> 01:26:28.08
I think I think you accepted the pitch.

2104
01:26:28.08 --> 01:26:31.08
The best thing to do if someone wants to know, you get mixed one up.

2105
01:26:31.08 --> 01:26:32.08
Yeah.

2106
01:26:32.08 --> 01:26:34.08
Because when as soon as you mix one up, people are like, oh, yeah.

2107
01:26:34.08 --> 01:26:35.08
I'm going to get it.

2108
01:26:35.08 --> 01:26:36.08
I'm getting this now.

2109
01:26:36.08 --> 01:26:37.08
Because how can this be good for you?

2110
01:26:37.08 --> 01:26:38.08
Yeah.

2111
01:26:38.08 --> 01:26:39.08
That's the question.

2112
01:26:39.08 --> 01:26:40.08
How can this be good for you?

2113
01:26:40.08 --> 01:26:41.08
Yeah.

2114
01:26:41.08 --> 01:26:42.08
Tastes like that.

2115
01:26:42.08 --> 01:26:43.08
True.

2116
01:26:43.08 --> 01:26:46.08
Mid chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla.

2117
01:26:46.08 --> 01:26:47.08
Darkness, the chocolate.

2118
01:26:47.08 --> 01:26:48.08
The darkness.

2119
01:26:48.08 --> 01:26:49.08
Darkness.

2120
01:26:49.08 --> 01:26:53.08
And then there's this is what I believe to be kind of epic.

2121
01:26:53.08 --> 01:26:55.08
Warrior kid milk.

2122
01:26:55.08 --> 01:26:56.08
Yes.

2123
01:26:56.08 --> 01:26:59.08
Because warrior kid milk, you can go to your grocery store.

2124
01:26:59.08 --> 01:27:02.08
And you can buy something that will flavor the milk.

2125
01:27:02.08 --> 01:27:04.08
So that your kids will drink milk.

2126
01:27:04.08 --> 01:27:07.08
But while your drink while you're giving the milk,

2127
01:27:07.08 --> 01:27:10.08
you're also giving them poison.

2128
01:27:10.08 --> 01:27:11.08
You.

2129
01:27:11.08 --> 01:27:12.08
Right.

2130
01:27:12.08 --> 01:27:13.08
Sugar poison or is enough.

2131
01:27:13.08 --> 01:27:14.08
Yeah.

2132
01:27:14.08 --> 01:27:15.08
You're going to eat enough sugar that you die.

2133
01:27:15.08 --> 01:27:16.08
Yeah.

2134
01:27:16.08 --> 01:27:17.08
Right.

2135
01:27:17.08 --> 01:27:18.08
People do it all the time.

2136
01:27:18.08 --> 01:27:19.08
They get diabetes.

2137
01:27:19.08 --> 01:27:20.08
Yeah.

2138
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:22.08
So we don't want to give our kids poison.

2139
01:27:22.08 --> 01:27:24.08
We want to give them power.

2140
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:25.08
How do we do it?

2141
01:27:25.08 --> 01:27:26.08
We got warrior kid milk.

2142
01:27:26.08 --> 01:27:28.08
We got strawberry and chocolate.

2143
01:27:28.08 --> 01:27:29.08
They taste amazing.

2144
01:27:29.08 --> 01:27:31.08
They are engineered.

2145
01:27:31.08 --> 01:27:33.08
The best possible food that your kids

2146
01:27:33.08 --> 01:27:35.08
Gonna eat.

2147
01:27:35.08 --> 01:27:36.08
Yeah.

2148
01:27:36.08 --> 01:27:37.08
Think about it.

2149
01:27:37.08 --> 01:27:38.08
You can say, oh, you want some dessert.

2150
01:27:38.08 --> 01:27:39.08
And they're get all excited.

2151
01:27:39.08 --> 01:27:41.08
Here, have a strawberry milkshake.

2152
01:27:41.08 --> 01:27:43.08
And what do they think?

2153
01:27:43.08 --> 01:27:44.08
Thank you.

2154
01:27:44.08 --> 01:27:45.08
Yeah.

2155
01:27:45.08 --> 01:27:46.08
Can I have more?

2156
01:27:46.08 --> 01:27:47.08
And you know what you say?

2157
01:27:47.08 --> 01:27:48.08
Sure.

2158
01:27:48.08 --> 01:27:49.08
Of course you can.

2159
01:27:49.08 --> 01:27:50.08
You can have all you want.

2160
01:27:50.08 --> 01:27:51.08
Yeah.

2161
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:53.08
And probiotics and vitamins.

2162
01:27:53.08 --> 01:27:57.08
This is everything you're supposed to be eating as a child to grow up and be strong.

2163
01:27:57.08 --> 01:27:59.08
And a world beater.

2164
01:27:59.08 --> 01:28:00.08
You.

2165
01:28:00.08 --> 01:28:02.08
The time.

2166
01:28:02.08 --> 01:28:03.08
All right.

2167
01:28:03.08 --> 01:28:04.08
Check.

2168
01:28:04.08 --> 01:28:05.08
Yes.

2169
01:28:05.08 --> 01:28:06.08
Okay.

2170
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:08.08
Also, if you want to stay in the bath and represent at the same time.

2171
01:28:08.08 --> 01:28:10.08
A tire wise.

2172
01:28:10.08 --> 01:28:11.08
Chocolate store.

2173
01:28:11.08 --> 01:28:12.08
It's called Jocco store.

2174
01:28:12.08 --> 01:28:14.08
So you're going to jocco store.com.

2175
01:28:14.08 --> 01:28:17.08
That's where you can get your t-shirts.

2176
01:28:17.08 --> 01:28:18.08
More trash.

2177
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:23.08
And it's good to have more than one rash card for multiple reasons.

2178
01:28:23.08 --> 01:28:28.08
One is that if one gets dirty, you don't have to rush to wash it or rush to get it back in the rotation.

2179
01:28:28.08 --> 01:28:29.08
And necessarily.

2180
01:28:29.08 --> 01:28:31.08
It could be a whole decision making process.

2181
01:28:31.08 --> 01:28:32.08
You got to deal with it.

2182
01:28:32.08 --> 01:28:33.08
It's possible.

2183
01:28:33.08 --> 01:28:34.08
It's possible.

2184
01:28:34.08 --> 01:28:35.08
It's possible.

2185
01:28:35.08 --> 01:28:36.08
Yes.

2186
01:28:36.08 --> 01:28:37.08
But you know what I ran into.

2187
01:28:37.08 --> 01:28:39.08
And this is so psychological.

2188
01:28:39.08 --> 01:28:42.08
So I, you know, I, whatever, I have a bunch of rash cards.

2189
01:28:42.08 --> 01:28:44.08
So I get injured wearing this one rash card.

2190
01:28:44.08 --> 01:28:46.08
And I, I don't, why are it anymore?

2191
01:28:46.08 --> 01:28:48.08
Because I'm like, oh, it made me injured.

2192
01:28:48.08 --> 01:28:49.08
Yeah.

2193
01:28:49.08 --> 01:28:50.08
You think superstition.

2194
01:28:50.08 --> 01:28:51.08
Yeah.

2195
01:28:51.08 --> 01:28:53.08
But he's think I know that superstition is fake.

2196
01:28:53.08 --> 01:28:56.08
But you know what I'm superstitious about?

2197
01:28:56.08 --> 01:28:57.08
Being superstitious.

2198
01:28:57.08 --> 01:28:58.08
No, no, I don't care.

2199
01:28:58.08 --> 01:29:00.08
Yeah, see if it's hurt than hurt you bro.

2200
01:29:00.08 --> 01:29:01.08
I know, bro.

2201
01:29:01.08 --> 01:29:02.08
I know exactly what hurt me.

2202
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:03.08
That's what makes it even worse.

2203
01:29:03.08 --> 01:29:04.08
Either way.

2204
01:29:04.08 --> 01:29:05.08
Whether that's your,

2205
01:29:05.08 --> 01:29:07.08
Are you going to retire the rash card that you wore today?

2206
01:29:07.08 --> 01:29:09.08
When were you training?

2207
01:29:09.08 --> 01:29:10.08
No.

2208
01:29:10.08 --> 01:29:11.08
No.

2209
01:29:11.08 --> 01:29:11.08
No.

2210
01:29:11.08 --> 01:29:12.08
Are you sure?

2211
01:29:12.08 --> 01:29:12.08
No.

2212
01:29:12.08 --> 01:29:13.08
Cause.

2213
01:29:13.08 --> 01:29:16.08
I can't see.

2214
01:29:16.08 --> 01:29:18.08
I see what you did there.

2215
01:29:18.08 --> 01:29:19.08
No, that none of the way.

2216
01:29:19.08 --> 01:29:21.08
Rascar to work today was all good.

2217
01:29:21.08 --> 01:29:24.08
It was, the problem I had today was psychological.

2218
01:29:24.08 --> 01:29:27.08
And it wasn't really actually you were my problem.

2219
01:29:27.08 --> 01:29:28.08
Straight up.

2220
01:29:28.08 --> 01:29:29.08
You were my problem.

2221
01:29:29.08 --> 01:29:30.08
Yeah.

2222
01:29:30.08 --> 01:29:31.08
That's the extreme.

2223
01:29:31.08 --> 01:29:33.08
I thought it was funny though.

2224
01:29:33.08 --> 01:29:36.08
For all my jiditsu career, you know, if I have a good role with someone

2225
01:29:36.08 --> 01:29:39.08
and I, and I, and I, you know, do good against them.

2226
01:29:39.08 --> 01:29:41.08
A lot of times they say,

2227
01:29:41.08 --> 01:29:43.08
you're really strong, right?

2228
01:29:43.08 --> 01:29:45.08
They never say like, oh, you got good jiditsu.

2229
01:29:45.08 --> 01:29:48.08
They never say, oh, like I liked your guard passing.

2230
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:51.08
Or, hey, you got a really good hit movement.

2231
01:29:51.08 --> 01:29:52.08
No, they don't say that.

2232
01:29:52.08 --> 01:29:54.08
Whether they say is you're strong.

2233
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:55.08
Yeah.

2234
01:29:55.08 --> 01:29:56.08
That's what they say.

2235
01:29:56.08 --> 01:29:57.08
Mm.

2236
01:29:57.08 --> 01:30:01.08
Today I got my first kind of alternate compliment from echo Charles.

2237
01:30:01.08 --> 01:30:03.08
You didn't say I was strong?

2238
01:30:03.08 --> 01:30:04.08
No.

2239
01:30:04.08 --> 01:30:07.08
You said I psychologically destroyed you.

2240
01:30:07.08 --> 01:30:08.08
Yeah.

2241
01:30:08.08 --> 01:30:12.08
I know.

2242
01:30:12.08 --> 01:30:13.08
What was the whole thing?

2243
01:30:13.08 --> 01:30:17.08
Okay, so you and you've been doing this kind of recently where like,

2244
01:30:17.08 --> 01:30:20.08
I can't, I don't even have to be breathing hard, but just maybe just a little.

2245
01:30:20.08 --> 01:30:21.08
You'll like act.

2246
01:30:21.08 --> 01:30:23.08
You'll be like, put on this little shirt.

2247
01:30:23.08 --> 01:30:25.08
Like, oh, like, or all like push here or something.

2248
01:30:25.08 --> 01:30:26.08
You're like, oh, man.

2249
01:30:26.08 --> 01:30:30.08
Like, you won't say that, but your body will be like, oh, that push is so hard.

2250
01:30:30.08 --> 01:30:31.08
So you'll do that.

2251
01:30:31.08 --> 01:30:32.08
And I know what you're doing.

2252
01:30:32.08 --> 01:30:36.08
Obviously, because you make it obvious, but then what that does to me is like,

2253
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:37.08
man, it's like,

2254
01:30:37.08 --> 01:30:40.08
you don't really take me seriously right now.

2255
01:30:40.08 --> 01:30:45.08
So it kind of makes nothing angry, but a little bit like frustrated because I'm trying to do a little.

2256
01:30:45.08 --> 01:30:46.08
Something else.

2257
01:30:46.08 --> 01:30:47.08
It sounds like something.

2258
01:30:47.08 --> 01:30:55.08
And then yeah, then when you wind up like doing things and then I'll kind of look at you and kind of feel.

2259
01:30:55.08 --> 01:30:58.08
And then you do this real good normal face kind of scenario.

2260
01:30:58.08 --> 01:31:03.08
And I think that I can do good normal face too, but on the inside, I don't feel normal face.

2261
01:31:03.08 --> 01:31:06.08
But all I see is like, you're just, just being whatever.

2262
01:31:06.08 --> 01:31:10.08
And it doesn't look like just so you don't on the inside and the outside, you don't.

2263
01:31:10.08 --> 01:31:12.08
On the inside, you don't feel normal face.

2264
01:31:12.08 --> 01:31:14.08
It doesn't look normal on the outside.

2265
01:31:14.08 --> 01:31:16.08
It looks pretty evident what's happening.

2266
01:31:16.08 --> 01:31:18.08
Well, I don't know.

2267
01:31:18.08 --> 01:31:20.08
Yeah, at the end of the day, it's sort of just crept in.

2268
01:31:20.08 --> 01:31:30.08
And yeah, I didn't, like, maintain the composure that I think is required to function at a, you know, at a better level than I did today.

2269
01:31:30.08 --> 01:31:31.08
Put it that way.

2270
01:31:31.08 --> 01:31:34.08
And the thing is, right when the timer goes off when we're done,

2271
01:31:34.08 --> 01:31:37.08
it's like, it's like a avalanche of like,

2272
01:31:37.08 --> 01:31:39.08
She's elective.

2273
01:31:39.08 --> 01:31:40.08
It's not shame.

2274
01:31:40.08 --> 01:31:42.08
I always think it's all part of the process.

2275
01:31:42.08 --> 01:31:45.08
No matter how long and painful the process is.

2276
01:31:45.08 --> 01:31:52.08
Did you come in today with, with a good positive attitude on the, what the outcome was going to be?

2277
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:52.08
Yeah.

2278
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:53.08
Do you feel good today?

2279
01:31:53.08 --> 01:31:54.08
Yes.

2280
01:31:54.08 --> 01:32:00.08
So, and it, just to be accurate, like, I don't, we always joke about this, but I don't come in thinking

2281
01:32:00.08 --> 01:32:05.08
you're, can you just do it?

2282
01:32:05.08 --> 01:32:06.08
Yeah, you're not positive.

2283
01:32:06.08 --> 01:32:07.08
Are you sure about that?

2284
01:32:07.08 --> 01:32:08.08
I don't think of that.

2285
01:32:08.08 --> 01:32:12.08
I know for a fact there's been days where you've come in, you, I can see it in your eyes.

2286
01:32:12.08 --> 01:32:14.08
You're thinking, I can do this today.

2287
01:32:14.08 --> 01:32:17.08
Well, not be, well, right?

2288
01:32:17.08 --> 01:32:19.08
I do think that yes, I can do this.

2289
01:32:19.08 --> 01:32:23.08
But it's not up and you kind of sometimes you bow up out of fear.

2290
01:32:23.08 --> 01:32:26.08
You just trying to convince yourself, you're trying to be like a peacock, right?

2291
01:32:26.08 --> 01:32:27.08
Sometimes that happens.

2292
01:32:27.08 --> 01:32:28.08
That's cool.

2293
01:32:28.08 --> 01:32:30.08
I don't hold it against you. I just accept it.

2294
01:32:30.08 --> 01:32:33.08
But sometimes you actually think like today's the big day.

2295
01:32:33.08 --> 01:32:36.08
And when I see that look, yeah, I think, okay.

2296
01:32:36.08 --> 01:32:40.08
Well, it's not about, like, okay, I'm going to like beat up, Joc.

2297
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:41.08
It's not that.

2298
01:32:41.08 --> 01:32:44.08
It's more that, like I have a handful of things.

2299
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:47.08
The handful is all you need to do is capitalize on one mistake.

2300
01:32:47.08 --> 01:32:48.08
Yeah.

2301
01:32:48.08 --> 01:32:49.08
That's all that it is.

2302
01:32:49.08 --> 01:32:49.08
Yeah.

2303
01:32:49.08 --> 01:32:52.08
You can just play the numbers game now, you know?

2304
01:32:52.08 --> 01:32:54.08
You're, you're good enough at your jutsu now.

2305
01:32:54.08 --> 01:32:56.08
If I make a mistake, you can capitalize on it.

2306
01:32:56.08 --> 01:32:58.08
You can just, you can just play the odds.

2307
01:32:58.08 --> 01:33:01.08
I can beat you 100 times and I can beat you 100 times,

2308
01:33:01.08 --> 01:33:02.08
or I can tap you out.

2309
01:33:02.08 --> 01:33:04.08
No, we don't even care.

2310
01:33:04.08 --> 01:33:06.08
It doesn't even, it doesn't even mean anything.

2311
01:33:06.08 --> 01:33:09.08
You roll the dice one time and you get snake eyes.

2312
01:33:09.08 --> 01:33:10.08
You get the big win.

2313
01:33:10.08 --> 01:33:11.08
Yeah.

2314
01:33:11.08 --> 01:33:12.08
That's where it's at.

2315
01:33:12.08 --> 01:33:14.08
Yeah, it'd be at 7 or 11, but yeah, well, sorry.

2316
01:33:14.08 --> 01:33:15.08
So, done not all good.

2317
01:33:15.08 --> 01:33:17.08
Yeah, it's like an insurgent situation for sure.

2318
01:33:17.08 --> 01:33:22.08
Yeah, yeah, you can smash me all you want, but it'll get you one time and never stay.

2319
01:33:22.08 --> 01:33:23.08
Yeah.

2320
01:33:23.08 --> 01:33:26.08
And it's normally not, like, I'm not necessarily trying to get it.

2321
01:33:26.08 --> 01:33:28.08
Actually, most of the time, pretty much all the time,

2322
01:33:28.08 --> 01:33:32.08
I'm not trying to, like, the goal is never to tap anyone out today.

2323
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:37.08
It's not that it's like to, to practice new things that I feel like I'm getting a hold of.

2324
01:33:37.08 --> 01:33:38.08
Okay.

2325
01:33:38.08 --> 01:33:40.08
Again, certain levels of people.

2326
01:33:40.08 --> 01:33:42.08
And then, so you're not trying to tap me out.

2327
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:46.08
Well, that, of course I am, but that's not like the goal for that day.

2328
01:33:46.08 --> 01:33:47.08
You know, it's kind of thing.

2329
01:33:47.08 --> 01:33:52.08
It's more like, okay, I'm going to put together this, like, defense and combine with this little thing and whatever.

2330
01:33:52.08 --> 01:33:56.08
And for you, it's real specific because it's like rolling with you isn't like this,

2331
01:33:56.08 --> 01:33:58.08
it's like, very specific scenario.

2332
01:33:58.08 --> 01:34:02.08
And which includes the psychological part.

2333
01:34:02.08 --> 01:34:02.08
Yeah.

2334
01:34:02.08 --> 01:34:10.08
And that's why I noticed a psychological devastation that you sort of had today is because after the time the time went off we're done,

2335
01:34:10.08 --> 01:34:15.08
it all came to me like, man, you just got destroyed psychologically so bad.

2336
01:34:15.08 --> 01:34:19.08
That goal is that you had for that specific role and for all roles with chocolate today.

2337
01:34:19.08 --> 01:34:22.08
Like literally didn't have anything to do with the role that you just did.

2338
01:34:22.08 --> 01:34:23.08
I don't go right now.

2339
01:34:23.08 --> 01:34:28.08
Because of like your whole mindset, you know, and it was all because of stuff you're doing.

2340
01:34:28.08 --> 01:34:31.08
And here's the kind of the dichotomy of it.

2341
01:34:31.08 --> 01:34:33.08
It's like super fun when it happens.

2342
01:34:33.08 --> 01:34:37.08
But because it's like the frustration is like pushing you know,

2343
01:34:37.08 --> 01:34:41.08
but then it's like at the end of the day, it's all just one big game, you know.

2344
01:34:41.08 --> 01:34:45.08
But it, it, there's a legitimate amount of frustration in there.

2345
01:34:45.08 --> 01:34:49.08
It's funny because I can see that dichotomy in your face.

2346
01:34:49.08 --> 01:34:52.08
Like I can tell that you're mad, but I can also tell that it's fun.

2347
01:34:52.08 --> 01:34:54.08
You know, but you do get frustrated.

2348
01:34:54.08 --> 01:35:00.08
Yeah, but sometimes you get legitimately like, like you make noises.

2349
01:35:00.08 --> 01:35:03.08
Like frustration like groans or grouse.

2350
01:35:03.08 --> 01:35:04.08
You know what I mean?

2351
01:35:04.08 --> 01:35:08.08
Yeah, but it's like at, you know how like when then you know what else you'll do?

2352
01:35:08.08 --> 01:35:10.08
Let's go again right now.

2353
01:35:10.08 --> 01:35:12.08
Right? Like a little kid. Like a six year old.

2354
01:35:12.08 --> 01:35:16.08
I know real, but the thing is like for a, and I say from the outside,

2355
01:35:16.08 --> 01:35:18.08
I can see how that could, you know what I don't like.

2356
01:35:18.08 --> 01:35:19.08
You know what I don't like.

2357
01:35:19.08 --> 01:35:23.08
You know what I don't like is when I tap someone out.

2358
01:35:23.08 --> 01:35:28.08
Let's say I'm in, I'm in a half guard and I tap someone out with something.

2359
01:35:28.08 --> 01:35:30.08
And I let go.

2360
01:35:30.08 --> 01:35:34.08
And then they're like, then they want to keep going like, as if that just didn't happen.

2361
01:35:34.08 --> 01:35:35.08
Oh, from that exact position.

2362
01:35:35.08 --> 01:35:37.08
You know, like that to me today.

2363
01:35:37.08 --> 01:35:40.08
Yeah. And I was like, I mean, it's not, it's not like it's a big deal.

2364
01:35:40.08 --> 01:35:46.08
But I was, I then I'm like, okay, because you know, I mean, I did whatever move I did.

2365
01:35:46.08 --> 01:35:50.08
And then I let go, you tap and then I let go of it.

2366
01:35:50.08 --> 01:35:51.08
Right.

2367
01:35:51.08 --> 01:35:53.08
And then it's like, we'll just keep going.

2368
01:35:53.08 --> 01:35:54.08
Yeah.

2369
01:35:54.08 --> 01:35:56.08
And I'm like, what, what, why would we keep going?

2370
01:35:56.08 --> 01:35:58.08
You just, you just submitted.

2371
01:35:58.08 --> 01:35:59.08
Yeah.

2372
01:35:59.08 --> 01:36:02.08
And there's other, the other thing is sometimes people,

2373
01:36:02.08 --> 01:36:05.08
I think you've done this to me like maybe 10 times.

2374
01:36:05.08 --> 01:36:08.08
No, maybe five times where you tap.

2375
01:36:08.08 --> 01:36:11.08
And then like, I let go. And then you like come at me.

2376
01:36:11.08 --> 01:36:14.08
Like you like you like double leg or whatever you like grab.

2377
01:36:14.08 --> 01:36:15.08
And you try it.

2378
01:36:15.08 --> 01:36:17.08
You know, and that's another one.

2379
01:36:17.08 --> 01:36:18.08
I'm like, okay.

2380
01:36:18.08 --> 01:36:18.08
Yeah.

2381
01:36:18.08 --> 01:36:20.08
I see where I see how this is going.

2382
01:36:20.08 --> 01:36:22.08
And I think you're doing that out of frustration.

2383
01:36:22.08 --> 01:36:22.08
Yeah.

2384
01:36:22.08 --> 01:36:23.08
Taurus chili.

2385
01:36:23.08 --> 01:36:28.08
Partially out of like, you understand sometimes you want to learn what just happened, right?

2386
01:36:28.08 --> 01:36:30.08
Like he put me back in that position.

2387
01:36:30.08 --> 01:36:30.08
Yes.

2388
01:36:30.08 --> 01:36:31.08
Cool.

2389
01:36:31.08 --> 01:36:32.08
Yeah.

2390
01:36:32.08 --> 01:36:33.08
I get that part too.

2391
01:36:33.08 --> 01:36:35.08
And even that kind of bothers me again.

2392
01:36:35.08 --> 01:36:39.08
But I could see, you know what, though, from an offensive standpoint,

2393
01:36:39.08 --> 01:36:42.08
like from your position and someone's like, okay, we start from there.

2394
01:36:42.08 --> 01:36:46.08
It's kind of like, you know the, it's like, not linear,

2395
01:36:46.08 --> 01:36:51.08
but you know the path of, like, from start to finish that whole path is like a big

2396
01:36:51.08 --> 01:36:56.08
creative learning battle fight twins losses like a, it's a whole path.

2397
01:36:56.08 --> 01:37:01.08
I think that's why it bothers me because I like that whole thing.

2398
01:37:01.08 --> 01:37:01.08
Yeah.

2399
01:37:01.08 --> 01:37:03.08
And I completed that whole thing.

2400
01:37:03.08 --> 01:37:04.08
Yeah.

2401
01:37:04.08 --> 01:37:05.08
Yeah.

2402
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:07.08
That whole thing of, because let's face it.

2403
01:37:07.08 --> 01:37:08.08
It's a big.

2404
01:37:08.08 --> 01:37:10.08
There's a lot of things that go on.

2405
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:15.08
There's a lot of things that happen from from, we start rolling or you start rolling with someone

2406
01:37:15.08 --> 01:37:17.08
to someone submits.

2407
01:37:17.08 --> 01:37:18.08
There's all kinds of things.

2408
01:37:18.08 --> 01:37:20.08
Especially you're starting standing.

2409
01:37:20.08 --> 01:37:21.08
You got to take down a contend with.

2410
01:37:21.08 --> 01:37:22.08
You got guard passing.

2411
01:37:22.08 --> 01:37:23.08
You got guard recovery.

2412
01:37:23.08 --> 01:37:24.08
You got switch.

2413
01:37:24.08 --> 01:37:27.08
Get all these things to get to this point where you can actually submit somebody.

2414
01:37:27.08 --> 01:37:28.08
Yeah.

2415
01:37:28.08 --> 01:37:32.08
And all of a sudden we're just going to skip 85% of that battle, which by the way,

2416
01:37:32.08 --> 01:37:40.08
from my perspective, all that time, all that battle is I'm maneuvering the whole time.

2417
01:37:40.08 --> 01:37:41.08
You know what I mean?

2418
01:37:41.08 --> 01:37:42.08
Yeah.

2419
01:37:42.08 --> 01:37:43.08
It's like a part of my game.

2420
01:37:43.08 --> 01:37:46.08
It's all part of me getting that submission.

2421
01:37:46.08 --> 01:37:48.08
Sommission doesn't start when I hit the mat.

2422
01:37:48.08 --> 01:37:50.08
The submission, it starts before we shake hands.

2423
01:37:50.08 --> 01:37:51.08
That whole.

2424
01:37:51.08 --> 01:37:52.08
You know what I'm saying?

2425
01:37:52.08 --> 01:37:53.08
Yeah.

2426
01:37:53.08 --> 01:37:56.08
So when we skip a big chunk of the, I like that whole part of the battle.

2427
01:37:56.08 --> 01:37:57.08
Yeah.

2428
01:37:57.08 --> 01:37:59.08
So when we skip it, I just feel like, oh, that's kind of weird.

2429
01:37:59.08 --> 01:38:00.08
Yeah.

2430
01:38:00.08 --> 01:38:04.08
And I just jumped to the end of the good song that has the guitar solo.

2431
01:38:04.08 --> 01:38:06.08
Like, no, you got to listen the whole song, man.

2432
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:07.08
Yeah.

2433
01:38:07.08 --> 01:38:08.08
I appreciate that thing.

2434
01:38:08.08 --> 01:38:09.08
You're right.

2435
01:38:09.08 --> 01:38:11.08
A good movie, right?

2436
01:38:11.08 --> 01:38:14.08
Let's just skip to the scene where the battle takes place.

2437
01:38:14.08 --> 01:38:15.08
You have you ever done that?

2438
01:38:15.08 --> 01:38:16.08
You just watch the battle scene.

2439
01:38:16.08 --> 01:38:18.08
It's not as good as when you watch the whole.

2440
01:38:18.08 --> 01:38:18.08
Right.

2441
01:38:18.08 --> 01:38:20.08
You're going to want to hear the whole.

2442
01:38:20.08 --> 01:38:21.08
I want the whole build up to take place.

2443
01:38:21.08 --> 01:38:22.08
Yeah.

2444
01:38:22.08 --> 01:38:23.08
I just want to watch the battle scene.

2445
01:38:23.08 --> 01:38:24.08
Yeah.

2446
01:38:24.08 --> 01:38:25.08
That's actually, that's good.

2447
01:38:25.08 --> 01:38:28.08
And I might actually glide that we kind of analyze it because,

2448
01:38:28.08 --> 01:38:31.08
Yeah.

2449
01:38:31.08 --> 01:38:32.08
Because it could be looked at.

2450
01:38:32.08 --> 01:38:34.08
I always looked at it because I've done that.

2451
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:36.08
Like, I don't always do that.

2452
01:38:36.08 --> 01:38:37.08
No, actually.

2453
01:38:37.08 --> 01:38:39.08
You've done it probably five times.

2454
01:38:39.08 --> 01:38:41.08
We've rolled thousands of times.

2455
01:38:41.08 --> 01:38:42.08
Yeah.

2456
01:38:42.08 --> 01:38:44.08
And it's like, okay, can we start from there kind of thing?

2457
01:38:44.08 --> 01:38:46.08
And it's a little bit different.

2458
01:38:46.08 --> 01:38:48.08
A little bit different is like, hey, can you just,

2459
01:38:48.08 --> 01:38:50.08
wait, put that back on me?

2460
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:52.08
Let me see if I could get out.

2461
01:38:52.08 --> 01:38:53.08
Okay, you got out cool now.

2462
01:38:53.08 --> 01:38:54.08
We'll start again.

2463
01:38:54.08 --> 01:38:55.08
Right.

2464
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:55.08
Right.

2465
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:56.08
Now, I'm not talking about that.

2466
01:38:56.08 --> 01:38:57.08
Yeah.

2467
01:38:57.08 --> 01:38:58.08
Yeah.

2468
01:38:58.08 --> 01:38:59.08
Yeah.

2469
01:38:59.08 --> 01:38:59.08
Yeah.

2470
01:38:59.08 --> 01:39:00.08
Yeah.

2471
01:39:00.08 --> 01:39:01.08
Yeah.

2472
01:39:01.08 --> 01:39:02.08
Yeah.

2473
01:39:02.08 --> 01:39:03.08
Yeah.

2474
01:39:03.08 --> 01:39:03.08
Yeah.

2475
01:39:03.08 --> 01:39:04.08
Yeah.

2476
01:39:04.08 --> 01:39:05.08
That was made.

2477
01:39:05.08 --> 01:39:06.08
And I've done that before.

2478
01:39:06.08 --> 01:39:07.08
Really rarely.

2479
01:39:07.08 --> 01:39:08.08
But I looked at it as shoot.

2480
01:39:08.08 --> 01:39:09.08
That was like a plot.

2481
01:39:09.08 --> 01:39:11.08
Like, I made a legitimate mistake right there.

2482
01:39:11.08 --> 01:39:14.08
Let me like get back in that mindset and continue actually rolling.

2483
01:39:14.08 --> 01:39:16.08
I think that's part of what bothers me.

2484
01:39:16.08 --> 01:39:17.08
Yeah.

2485
01:39:17.08 --> 01:39:18.08
It's not up to me.

2486
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:20.08
I think part of what bothers me is I think to myself.

2487
01:39:20.08 --> 01:39:22.08
Oh, you just made this little mistake.

2488
01:39:22.08 --> 01:39:23.08
And it was kind of a flu.

2489
01:39:23.08 --> 01:39:24.08
Right.

2490
01:39:24.08 --> 01:39:26.08
That's what you're implying is like, oh, this is just a little flu.

2491
01:39:26.08 --> 01:39:28.08
And it's like, you're lucky that won't happen again.

2492
01:39:28.08 --> 01:39:29.08
Yeah.

2493
01:39:29.08 --> 01:39:32.08
That's like, sometimes people get mad when I submit them.

2494
01:39:32.08 --> 01:39:34.08
Not very rarely.

2495
01:39:34.08 --> 01:39:39.08
And I'm always like, man, is that much of an insult that I just sat to.

2496
01:39:39.08 --> 01:39:40.08
You know what I mean?

2497
01:39:40.08 --> 01:39:41.08
Yeah.

2498
01:39:41.08 --> 01:39:42.08
Like, I'm not.

2499
01:39:42.08 --> 01:39:43.08
When somebody taps me on, I'm not mad at them.

2500
01:39:43.08 --> 01:39:44.08
Oh.

2501
01:39:44.08 --> 01:39:45.08
I'm like, dang.

2502
01:39:45.08 --> 01:39:46.08
Nice job.

2503
01:39:46.08 --> 01:39:47.08
That was awesome.

2504
01:39:47.08 --> 01:39:48.08
Good job.

2505
01:39:48.08 --> 01:39:49.08
Yeah.

2506
01:39:49.08 --> 01:39:50.08
But yeah.

2507
01:39:50.08 --> 01:39:51.08
I think people are mean anyway.

2508
01:39:51.08 --> 01:39:53.08
It's like any time when we get like anything's out of frustration.

2509
01:39:53.08 --> 01:40:00.08
It's literally like maybe a 30% frustration, 70% you're just a guy that can take that kind of abuse.

2510
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:03.08
You know, like, if you're like, okay, good, you know, you got me out.

2511
01:40:03.08 --> 01:40:05.08
And then you turn your back to reset.

2512
01:40:05.08 --> 01:40:08.08
And yeah, jump on your back or take it on whatever.

2513
01:40:08.08 --> 01:40:10.08
Like you can do that normally.

2514
01:40:10.08 --> 01:40:11.08
Yeah.

2515
01:40:11.08 --> 01:40:11.08
Yeah.

2516
01:40:11.08 --> 01:40:11.08
Yeah.

2517
01:40:11.08 --> 01:40:12.08
No.

2518
01:40:12.08 --> 01:40:13.08
And even when you do it to me, it's not like you.

2519
01:40:13.08 --> 01:40:17.08
You haven't ever like jumped and like put a rear-note could choke on or something like that.

2520
01:40:17.08 --> 01:40:18.08
Yeah.

2521
01:40:18.08 --> 01:40:22.08
You've kind of jumped into a slightly advantageous, but normal position for us to be in.

2522
01:40:22.08 --> 01:40:23.08
Yeah.

2523
01:40:23.08 --> 01:40:24.08
Which is no big deal.

2524
01:40:24.08 --> 01:40:24.08
Yeah.

2525
01:40:24.08 --> 01:40:26.08
You have taken my back a couple times.

2526
01:40:26.08 --> 01:40:27.08
Yeah.

2527
01:40:27.08 --> 01:40:32.08
But and then even then like, bro, we've been in this thing for long time where it's.

2528
01:40:32.08 --> 01:40:33.08
Let's say I got it.

2529
01:40:33.08 --> 01:40:35.08
Maybe that might, would that even bother you?

2530
01:40:35.08 --> 01:40:37.08
Let's say I jump on your back in one of those situations.

2531
01:40:37.08 --> 01:40:38.08
Then I got the rear-note get you.

2532
01:40:38.08 --> 01:40:39.08
Yeah.

2533
01:40:39.08 --> 01:40:40.08
And I finished it.

2534
01:40:40.08 --> 01:40:43.08
You, well, I would kind of be like, well, we both know.

2535
01:40:43.08 --> 01:40:44.08
You know, like, right?

2536
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:45.08
It's very catchy.

2537
01:40:45.08 --> 01:40:46.08
Yeah.

2538
01:40:46.08 --> 01:40:47.08
I took it down.

2539
01:40:47.08 --> 01:40:48.08
Yeah.

2540
01:40:48.08 --> 01:40:50.08
But real quick, back to the, uh, the path.

2541
01:40:50.08 --> 01:40:55.08
You know, like, when you, when you want to, like, you double guy out any once to start from that same position or whatever.

2542
01:40:55.08 --> 01:40:56.08
Yeah.

2543
01:40:56.08 --> 01:41:01.08
If you look at that path, that whole path that is so, let's, this, this, that's a valuable path.

2544
01:41:01.08 --> 01:41:03.08
Every path that you create.

2545
01:41:03.08 --> 01:41:05.08
It's like learning and it's this big thing and it's fun.

2546
01:41:05.08 --> 01:41:07.08
There's little competitiveness in there, whatever.

2547
01:41:07.08 --> 01:41:11.08
And at the end, you finish each path as like this tree or whatever.

2548
01:41:11.08 --> 01:41:12.08
It's done.

2549
01:41:12.08 --> 01:41:15.08
You finish it with your submission when you win or when you lose.

2550
01:41:15.08 --> 01:41:17.08
To entraining or even in competition.

2551
01:41:17.08 --> 01:41:18.08
You win or you lose.

2552
01:41:18.08 --> 01:41:26.08
You can't, like, after you win and complete your masterpiece path of wins and losing in a through the whole thing and you're done.

2553
01:41:26.08 --> 01:41:29.08
That guy just can't step in and be like, no, it's not done.

2554
01:41:29.08 --> 01:41:32.08
It's just sort of paused on my, like, right, you can't jump in and dictate that.

2555
01:41:32.08 --> 01:41:35.08
So if you lost, rather than you've got to start all over and try to create something else.

2556
01:41:35.08 --> 01:41:37.08
No, you know, try to do try new song.

2557
01:41:37.08 --> 01:41:38.08
You can't just, oh, yeah.

2558
01:41:38.08 --> 01:41:41.08
But at the same time.

2559
01:41:41.08 --> 01:41:47.08
If you're looking at, like, training rolling as just practice, just training.

2560
01:41:47.08 --> 01:41:48.08
Just, you know, whatever.

2561
01:41:48.08 --> 01:41:49.08
And so, yeah.

2562
01:41:49.08 --> 01:41:53.08
There's a big difference between, hey, we're going to actually practice right now.

2563
01:41:53.08 --> 01:41:55.08
And we're going to roll.

2564
01:41:55.08 --> 01:41:57.08
Yeah, because rolling is understood that is competitive.

2565
01:41:57.08 --> 01:41:59.08
That's the whole reason it works so good.

2566
01:41:59.08 --> 01:42:00.08
Yeah.

2567
01:42:00.08 --> 01:42:01.08
It has to be competitive.

2568
01:42:01.08 --> 01:42:03.08
So yes, that's why when you taught me out, I do consider it.

2569
01:42:03.08 --> 01:42:05.08
No matter how much percentage, whatever.

2570
01:42:05.08 --> 01:42:06.08
I do consider it.

2571
01:42:06.08 --> 01:42:08.08
You beat me straight up in practice and training.

2572
01:42:08.08 --> 01:42:12.08
You beat me because there's a significant amount of competition right there.

2573
01:42:12.08 --> 01:42:16.08
So yeah, you can't be messing with the other guys wins and do that.

2574
01:42:16.08 --> 01:42:17.08
Yeah.

2575
01:42:17.08 --> 01:42:18.08
You're right.

2576
01:42:18.08 --> 01:42:19.08
I can't, I'm never doing that ever again.

2577
01:42:19.08 --> 01:42:20.08
If you want to do it, it's fine.

2578
01:42:20.08 --> 01:42:21.08
I'm the same.

2579
01:42:21.08 --> 01:42:22.08
It's not.

2580
01:42:22.08 --> 01:42:23.08
It's not fine.

2581
01:42:23.08 --> 01:42:24.08
I'm not doing it.

2582
01:42:24.08 --> 01:42:25.08
I don't want to be that guy to do it, even.

2583
01:42:25.08 --> 01:42:26.08
It's being that guy.

2584
01:42:26.08 --> 01:42:30.08
Nonetheless, back to representing on Jockel's from Jockel's store.

2585
01:42:30.08 --> 01:42:31.08
Jockel has stuff.

2586
01:42:31.08 --> 01:42:34.08
Shirts and rash guards and poodies, hats.

2587
01:42:34.08 --> 01:42:35.08
Cool stuff.

2588
01:42:35.08 --> 01:42:37.08
You want to represent on the path.

2589
01:42:37.08 --> 01:42:39.08
If you, okay, so I made the new, a new good shirt.

2590
01:42:39.08 --> 01:42:40.08
I think it's on there.

2591
01:42:40.08 --> 01:42:41.08
Yeah, it's on there.

2592
01:42:41.08 --> 01:42:42.08
Hmm.

2593
01:42:42.08 --> 01:42:43.08
It's just, it's good.

2594
01:42:43.08 --> 01:42:44.08
It's good.

2595
01:42:44.08 --> 01:42:46.08
It's good literally.

2596
01:42:46.08 --> 01:42:48.08
It says good on it with the font.

2597
01:42:48.08 --> 01:42:49.08
But it does not have your head on it.

2598
01:42:49.08 --> 01:42:50.08
So it's way more basic.

2599
01:42:50.08 --> 01:42:51.08
Cool.

2600
01:42:51.08 --> 01:42:52.08
Cool.

2601
01:42:52.08 --> 01:42:55.08
That's the one where like you really got to be in the know.

2602
01:42:55.08 --> 01:42:56.08
You see it in the wild.

2603
01:42:56.08 --> 01:42:58.08
You're gonna be like, if you listen, you know.

2604
01:42:58.08 --> 01:42:59.08
Yeah.

2605
01:42:59.08 --> 01:43:00.08
Yeah.

2606
01:43:00.08 --> 01:43:03.08
You see the dude that got good on his thumbs.

2607
01:43:03.08 --> 01:43:04.08
I think it was his thumbs.

2608
01:43:04.08 --> 01:43:05.08
Oh yeah.

2609
01:43:05.08 --> 01:43:07.08
Joc on one and OD on the other.

2610
01:43:07.08 --> 01:43:08.08
Yeah, man.

2611
01:43:08.08 --> 01:43:09.08
Tattoo.

2612
01:43:09.08 --> 01:43:10.08
I dig it.

2613
01:43:10.08 --> 01:43:11.08
Yeah.

2614
01:43:11.08 --> 01:43:13.08
In proper font, by the way.

2615
01:43:13.08 --> 01:43:15.08
It's keeping the game.

2616
01:43:15.08 --> 01:43:16.08
Yeah.

01:43:16.08 --> 01:43:18.08

Aiden is up there making soap on his farm.

2650
01:44:18.08 --> 01:44:22.08
And what he wants us all to do is stay clean.

2651
01:44:22.08 --> 01:44:23.08
Did you tell him?

2652
01:44:23.08 --> 01:44:25.08
And then now he wants us to stay clean.

2653
01:44:25.08 --> 01:44:29.08
Are you just sort of, you know, imposing your tagline?

2654
01:44:29.08 --> 01:44:30.08
I impose the whole deal.

2655
01:44:30.08 --> 01:44:31.08
I'm going to go with you.

2656
01:44:31.08 --> 01:44:32.08
All right.

2657
01:44:32.08 --> 01:44:33.08
I dig it either way.

01:44:33.08 --> 01:44:34.08
Also, YouTube.

01:44:34.08 --> 01:44:35.08

There's also videos that echo perceives as very legit because he made him.

2665

It's a little company owned by my brother Dakota Meyer podcast 115,

2673
01:45:21.08 --> 01:45:28.08
by the way, absolutely an epic podcast to hear and listen to and to be a part of with Dakota.

2674
01:45:28.08 --> 01:45:31.08
And we became good friends after that.

2675
01:45:31.08 --> 01:45:33.08
And he's got this company.

2676
01:45:33.08 --> 01:45:35.08

And we'll help you stay on the path.

2679
01:45:46.08 --> 01:45:47.08
There's a discipline.

2680
01:45:47.08 --> 01:45:48.08
It goes freedom one.

2681
01:45:48.08 --> 01:45:49.08
There's one that says good on it.

2682
01:45:49.08 --> 01:45:54.08
If there's anything else you want, let me know on the social media.

2683
01:45:54.08 --> 01:45:57.08
And Dakota will make it happen.

2684
01:45:57.08 --> 01:45:58.08
Take it.

2685
01:45:58.08 --> 01:46:01.08
Also, when you're expanding your home gym,

2686
01:46:01.08 --> 01:46:06.08
you're going to want to put on it for your stuff.

2687
01:46:06.08 --> 01:46:09.08
Rings, jump ropes, kettle bells, primal bells.

2688
01:46:09.08 --> 01:46:12.08
Star Wars kettle bells as well.

2689
01:46:12.08 --> 01:46:14.08
Anyway, a lot of good stuff on there.

2690
01:46:14.08 --> 01:46:17.08
You got some immune stuff for your immune system.

2691
01:46:17.08 --> 01:46:20.08
Some of that is a lot of real good stuff on that go to on it.com slash jocca.

2692
01:46:20.08 --> 01:46:21.08
Really good stuff.

2693
01:46:21.08 --> 01:46:23.08
Also, we got some books.

2694
01:46:23.08 --> 01:46:25.08
Mikey in the dragons.

2695
01:46:25.08 --> 01:46:29.08
Mikey in the dragons is about a little kid that's trying to overcome some fear.

2696
01:46:29.08 --> 01:46:34.08
And by reading a book, the book is called the Dragon Prince.

2697
01:46:34.08 --> 01:46:36.08
Check it out, Mikey in the dragons.

2698
01:46:36.08 --> 01:46:38.08
Also, way the warrior kid.

2699
01:46:38.08 --> 01:46:42.08
One, two, and soon to be three.

2700
01:46:42.08 --> 01:46:45.08
That's a series of books about a kid.

2701
01:46:45.08 --> 01:46:48.08
That's having kind of normal trouble that kids have.

2702
01:46:48.08 --> 01:46:51.08
But he's got an uncle, uncle Jake.

2703
01:46:51.08 --> 01:46:53.08
Who used to be in the team.

2704
01:46:53.08 --> 01:46:55.08
Somebody comes and tells us, cousin out.

2705
01:46:55.08 --> 01:46:59.08
Yeah, this is, cousin is his nephew.

2706
01:46:59.08 --> 01:47:00.08
He comes and helps his nephew out.

2707
01:47:00.08 --> 01:47:02.08
So those are called the way the warrior kid.

2708
01:47:02.08 --> 01:47:04.08
Mark's mission and where there's a will.

2709
01:47:04.08 --> 01:47:10.08
His book, three, also just put in equals freedom field manual.

2710
01:47:10.08 --> 01:47:12.08
That's a book that you need.

2711
01:47:12.08 --> 01:47:14.08
Or it's a book you can give.

2712
01:47:14.08 --> 01:47:17.08
I'm super stoked when I meet people and they say,

2713
01:47:17.08 --> 01:47:21.08
Yep, I've given 28 copies of the Disponucle freedom field menu

2714
01:47:21.08 --> 01:47:24.08
or a way to other people and my family, other friends that I have.

2715
01:47:24.08 --> 01:47:31.08
I, because it will help people get on the path and live a better life.

2716
01:47:31.08 --> 01:47:32.08
That's a powerful thing.

2717
01:47:32.08 --> 01:47:35.08
If you can actually help someone live a better life,

2718
01:47:35.08 --> 01:47:37.08
there's a manual on how to live your life.

2719
01:47:37.08 --> 01:47:40.08
It's called the Disponucle Freedom Field Manual.

2720
01:47:40.08 --> 01:47:42.08
It's not a normal book.

2721
01:47:42.08 --> 01:47:44.08
It's not normal.

2722
01:47:44.08 --> 01:47:47.08
My publisher, when he was publishing it,

2723
01:47:47.08 --> 01:47:51.08
he said this book is the biggest risk that he has ever taken

2724
01:47:51.08 --> 01:47:53.08
in his publishing career.

2725
01:47:53.08 --> 01:47:59.08
And he also said, and we're actually my agent told me once the book came out.

2726
01:47:59.08 --> 01:48:07.08
The book sold more than any scenario that they had predicted for the book.

2727
01:48:07.08 --> 01:48:09.08
So they, you know, they do these predictions.

2728
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:11.08
If it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells,

2729
01:48:11.08 --> 01:48:12.08
it sells, it sells, the other thing.

2730
01:48:12.08 --> 01:48:16.08
There's something called 100% cell through rate,

2731
01:48:16.08 --> 01:48:20.08
which means every single book that got shipped got sold.

2732
01:48:20.08 --> 01:48:23.08
It does not happen. And then they're back ordered and had to make more.

2733
01:48:23.08 --> 01:48:26.08
Now the book is still selling like that.

2734
01:48:26.08 --> 01:48:29.08
Disponucle Freedom Field Manual.

2735
01:48:29.08 --> 01:48:30.08
Why does it keep selling?

2736
01:48:30.08 --> 01:48:32.08
Because people read it and they get it for people they know.

2737
01:48:32.08 --> 01:48:33.08
So check it out.

2738
01:48:33.08 --> 01:48:38.08
It is the manual telling you how to get on the path and stay on the path.

2739
01:48:38.08 --> 01:48:41.08
The audio version of that book is not on audible.

2740
01:48:41.08 --> 01:48:42.08
It's on iTunes.

2741
01:48:42.08 --> 01:48:43.08
It's on Amazon.

2742
01:48:43.08 --> 01:48:46.08
Music, it's on Google Play and other MP3 platforms.

2743
01:48:46.08 --> 01:48:48.08
Of course, there is extreme ownership.

2744
01:48:48.08 --> 01:48:57.08
The first book that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin, about the combat leadership principles that we learn on the battlefield and how you can apply them to your business and life.

2745
01:48:57.08 --> 01:49:02.08
And we followed that book up with the book called the dichotomy and leadership, which,

2746
01:49:02.08 --> 01:49:06.08
well, some people are saying, it's better than extreme ownership.

2747
01:49:06.08 --> 01:49:08.08
Read it, judge for yourself.

2748
01:49:08.08 --> 01:49:10.08
Tell us what you think.

2749
01:49:10.08 --> 01:49:14.08
I think if you read extreme ownership,

2750
01:49:14.08 --> 01:49:18.08
when you read dichotomy, a lot of things are going to fall into place.

2751
01:49:18.08 --> 01:49:23.08
A lot of little things that you didn't quite have at the way you wanted it to be.

2752
01:49:23.08 --> 01:49:25.08
When you read dichotomy, it's going to come into place.

2753
01:49:25.08 --> 01:49:28.08
Also, we got echelon front, which is our leadership consultancy.

2754
01:49:28.08 --> 01:49:30.08
We solved problems through leadership.

2755
01:49:30.08 --> 01:49:31.08
That's what we do.

2756
01:49:31.08 --> 01:49:36.08
It's me, Dave Babin, JP, to now Dave Burke, Flynn, Cochran, Mike Surrely, Mike Bima.

2757
01:49:36.08 --> 01:49:43.08
And our latest addition to the team, Master Chief Seal, retired Jason Gardner.

2758
01:49:43.08 --> 01:49:47.08
And our new student, Asheline, from dot com, if you want us to come work with your company, the

2759
01:49:47.08 --> 01:49:52.08
Master, we got three masters this year.

2760
01:49:52.08 --> 01:49:56.08
All masters ever have sold out.

2761
01:49:56.08 --> 01:49:59.08
These are going to sell out well, as well.

2762
01:49:59.08 --> 01:50:05.08
There's May 23rd and 24th in Chicago, September 19th and 20th in Denver.

2763
01:50:05.08 --> 01:50:10.08
December 4th and 5th in Sydney, Australia.

2764
01:50:10.08 --> 01:50:13.08
We got a lot of extreme ownership dot com.

2765
01:50:13.08 --> 01:50:16.08
If you want to come to these things, just go and register.

2766
01:50:16.08 --> 01:50:21.08
I had friends, friends that said, hey, you know, I didn't really sign up.

2767
01:50:21.08 --> 01:50:23.08
Can you just give me a couple tickets?

2768
01:50:23.08 --> 01:50:26.08
And I'm like, actually, no, I can't.

2769
01:50:26.08 --> 01:50:29.08
Because we can't fit any more people in the building.

2770
01:50:29.08 --> 01:50:31.08
So no.

2771
01:50:31.08 --> 01:50:36.08
So I can't help you if you wait too long.

2772
01:50:36.08 --> 01:50:38.08
Register, get on it early.

2773
01:50:38.08 --> 01:50:44.08
And if you want to come to this company, this is our interactive leadership training.

2774
01:50:44.08 --> 01:50:50.08
If you want to get everyone in your company aligned, you want everyone in your company to

2775
01:50:50.08 --> 01:50:53.08
understand the fundamental principles of extreme ownership.

2776
01:50:53.08 --> 01:50:58.08
If you want them to understand the fundamental laws of combat that we used on the battlefield

2777
01:50:58.08 --> 01:51:03.08
and that we have now taught two scores of businesses.

2778
01:51:03.08 --> 01:51:07.08
If you want to have that training, you can go to EF online.

2779
01:51:07.08 --> 01:51:10.08
It's interactive.

2780
01:51:10.08 --> 01:51:12.08
It's you have to make decisions.

2781
01:51:12.08 --> 01:51:15.08
It's choose your own adventure.

2782
01:51:15.08 --> 01:51:16.08
It's tests.

2783
01:51:16.08 --> 01:51:18.08
It's briefings.

2784
01:51:18.08 --> 01:51:19.08
It's everything.

2785
01:51:19.08 --> 01:51:20.08
And it's awesome.

2786
01:51:20.08 --> 01:51:24.08
So check out EF online.com.

2787
01:51:24.08 --> 01:51:30.08
Also, EF Overwatch where we are connecting proven leaders from the spec ops and combat aviation

2788
01:51:30.08 --> 01:51:34.08
communities with companies in this building sector.

2789
01:51:34.08 --> 01:51:37.08
Now here's the thing.

2790
01:51:37.08 --> 01:51:41.08
You might think, well, I've got to hire somebody that's experienced in this industry.

2791
01:51:41.08 --> 01:51:42.08
That's a good thought.

2792
01:51:42.08 --> 01:51:44.08
I understand where you're coming from.

2793
01:51:44.08 --> 01:51:50.08
What I recommend to you try is instead of hiring a person that has experienced in the industry

2794
01:51:50.08 --> 01:51:55.08
have hired somebody that has experienced in something more important that is leadership.

2795
01:51:55.08 --> 01:52:00.08
You can teach them and they can learn very quickly the industry that you're bringing them into.

2796
01:52:00.08 --> 01:52:07.08
What you can't teach someone and when you can't give them is 20 years, 25 years, 22 years of leadership experience

2797
01:52:07.08 --> 01:52:15.08
in the most high stakes business there is and that is war.

2798
01:52:15.08 --> 01:52:17.08
So go to EF Overwatch.com.

2799
01:52:17.08 --> 01:52:28.08
If you want to hire someone like that or if you are in that position of your vet and you want to look to get placed into a company.

2800
01:52:28.08 --> 01:52:32.08
That's looking for leadership. EF Overwatch.com.

2801
01:52:32.08 --> 01:52:43.08
And if you want to spend even more time with Echo Charles and myself because for some reason you think 500 hours of podcast isn't enough for you.

2802
01:52:43.08 --> 01:52:50.08
We are out there. We are lurking on the inner webs on Twitter, on Instagram and on Facebook.

2803
01:52:50.08 --> 01:52:52.08
Bookie.

2804
01:52:52.08 --> 01:53:01.08
Moja. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and thanks to all the people in uniform for your service.

2805
01:53:01.08 --> 01:53:03.08
That's our military personnel.

2806
01:53:03.08 --> 01:53:13.08
Also our police and law enforcement correction officers, border patrols, all first responders and tonight especially the firefighters,

2807
01:53:13.08 --> 01:53:22.08
which is Paramedics EMTs who face suffering and death on a daily basis and they learn how to handle it.

2808
01:53:22.08 --> 01:53:26.08
They learn how to stay balanced. They learn how to detach but not too much.

2809
01:53:26.08 --> 01:53:37.08
Thanks for all of you for providing us the freedom and security that we enjoy every day and to everyone else that's listening.

2810
01:53:37.08 --> 01:53:46.08
You have ideas and dreams and you have vision and that's cool.

2811
01:53:46.08 --> 01:53:47.08
That's awesome.

01:53:47.08 --> 01:53:53.08
But none of that means anything unless you execute.

2813
01:53:53.08 --> 01:53:59.08
So execute, move forward, take action and you know what, maybe your idea works, maybe it doesn't.

2814
01:53:59.08 --> 01:54:06.08
And if it doesn't and try another one and maybe none of them will ever work and that's fine because in the end

2815
01:54:06.08 --> 01:54:15.08
at a minimum you know at least you went out there and got after it.

2816
01:54:15.08 --> 01:54:39.08
So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
