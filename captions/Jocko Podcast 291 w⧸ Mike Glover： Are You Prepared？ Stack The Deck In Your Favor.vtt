00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.56
This is Jockel Podcast number 291, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.28
Your responsibilities may involve the command of more traditional forces, but in less traditional roles.

3
00:00:14.40 --> 00:00:20.96
Men risking their lives not as combatants, but as instructors or advisors, or as symbols of our nation's

4
00:00:20.96 --> 00:00:26.72
commitments. The fact that the United States is not directly at war in these areas in no way

5
00:00:26.72 --> 00:00:33.20
diminishes the skill and the courage that will be required the service to our country, which is rendered

6
00:00:33.20 --> 00:00:41.12
or the pain of the casualties, which are suffered. To cite one final example of the range of

7
00:00:41.12 --> 00:00:46.56
responsibilities that will fall upon you, you may hold a position of command with our special forces,

8
00:00:46.56 --> 00:00:51.76
forces which are too unconventional to be called conventional, forces which are growing in number

9
00:00:51.76 --> 00:00:58.64
and importance and significance for we now know that it is wholly misleading to call this the nuclear

10
00:00:58.64 --> 00:01:05.12
age, or to say that our security rests only on the doctrine of massive retaliation.

11
00:01:07.28 --> 00:01:10.80
Korea has not been the only battlegrounds since the end of the Second World War.

12
00:01:12.48 --> 00:01:21.04
Men have fought and died in Malaya, Greece, the Philippines, Algeria and Cuba and Cyprus,

13
00:01:21.04 --> 00:01:28.000
and almost continuously on the Indo-Chinese peninsula. No nuclear weapons have been fired.

14
00:01:28.88 --> 00:01:32.64
No massive nuclear retaliation has been considered appropriate.

15
00:01:34.56 --> 00:01:41.76
This is another type of war. New in its intensity, ancient in its origin, war by guerrillas,

16
00:01:41.76 --> 00:01:50.32
subversives, insurgents, assassins, war by ambush instead of by combat, by infiltration instead

17
00:01:50.32 --> 00:01:56.56
of aggression, seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him.

18
00:01:58.16 --> 00:02:04.48
It is a form of warfare uniquely adapted to what we, to what has strangely been called

19
00:02:04.48 --> 00:02:11.52
wars of liberation. To undermine the efforts of new and poor countries to maintain the freedom

20
00:02:12.24 --> 00:02:20.08
that they have finally achieved. It prays on economic unrest and ethnic conflicts. It requires

21
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:25.52
in those situations where we must counter it. And these are the kinds of challenges

22
00:02:25.52 --> 00:02:31.20
that will be before us in the next decade. If freedom is to be saved, a whole new kind of

23
00:02:31.20 --> 00:02:38.80
strategy, a wholly different kind of force and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training.

24
00:02:38.80 --> 00:02:51.28
That right there was an excerpt from a speech by John F. Kennedy to the 1962 graduating class

25
00:02:51.28 --> 00:02:57.04
of West Point, the United States Military Academy, and that same year he also released a message

26
00:02:57.04 --> 00:03:07.68
to the US Army. And that message read to the United States Army. Another military dimension,

27
00:03:07.68 --> 00:03:13.12
guerilla warfare, has necessarily been added to the American profession of arms.

28
00:03:14.88 --> 00:03:22.32
The literal translation of guerilla warfare, a little war, is hardly applicable to this ancient

29
00:03:22.32 --> 00:03:29.28
but at the same time modern threat. I note that the army has several terms which describe

30
00:03:29.28 --> 00:03:35.20
the various facets of the current struggle, wars of subversion, covert aggression, and in broad

31
00:03:35.20 --> 00:03:43.28
professional terms, special warfare, or unconventional warfare. By whatever name, this militant

32
00:03:43.28 --> 00:03:49.84
challenge to freedom calls for an improvement and enlargement of our own development of techniques

33
00:03:49.84 --> 00:03:57.84
and tactics, communications and logistics to meet this threat. The mission of our armed forces

34
00:03:57.84 --> 00:04:03.84
and especially the army today is to master these skills and techniques and to be able to help

35
00:04:03.84 --> 00:04:11.44
those who have the will to help themselves. Pure military skill is not enough.

36
00:04:12.96 --> 00:04:19.36
A full spectrum of military paramilitary and civil action must be blended to produce success.

37
00:04:21.76 --> 00:04:27.44
The enemy uses economic and political warfare, propaganda, and naked military aggression

38
00:04:27.44 --> 00:04:33.52
in an endless combination to oppose a free choice of government and suppress the rights of the

39
00:04:33.52 --> 00:04:44.32
individual by terror, by subversion, and by force of arms. To win in this struggle, our officers and men

40
00:04:44.32 --> 00:04:51.04
must understand and combine the political, economic, and civil actions with skilled military

41
00:04:51.04 --> 00:04:59.92
efforts in the execution of this mission. The green beret is again becoming a symbol of excellence,

42
00:04:59.92 --> 00:05:04.16
a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom.

43
00:05:06.64 --> 00:05:12.72
I know the United States Army will live up to its reputation for imagination, resourcefulness,

44
00:05:13.44 --> 00:05:20.56
and spirit as we meet this challenge, signed John F Kennedy.

45
00:05:20.56 --> 00:05:29.60
So, the Green beret, the U.S. Army Special Forces, were formed for this new type of warfare.

46
00:05:31.44 --> 00:05:36.40
Well, I guess as JFK said, new in its intensity but ancient in its origin.

47
00:05:38.08 --> 00:05:41.60
And today, almost 60 years since JFK made these statements,

48
00:05:42.96 --> 00:05:45.36
there's a new generation of soldiers that have trained

49
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:51.84
incessantly to fight this new type of warfare and were honored to have one of those soldiers here

50
00:05:51.84 --> 00:05:56.64
tonight with us to share some of his experiences. He served in the U.S. Army Special Forces,

51
00:05:57.52 --> 00:06:04.64
worked as a contractor for some government agencies and has continued to hone his skills and teach

52
00:06:04.64 --> 00:06:12.96
others through his company Fieldcraft. Survival, his name is Mike Glover. Mike, thanks for coming

53
00:06:12.96 --> 00:06:19.04
out, man. Thanks for having me on its an honor. I have it to be here. Green berets, Green berets,

54
00:06:20.16 --> 00:06:26.96
the deal. We're kind of a big deal. I don't know if you can do that. Yeah, you know, obviously

55
00:06:28.32 --> 00:06:36.000
the seal community gets quite a bit of, you know, flack because we're like, uh, I guess for lack

56
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.16
of a better word kind of popping the right now. Yes, but people seem to forget there was the green

57
00:06:40.16 --> 00:06:47.92
green beret, green beret movie way before and then I was thinking about the actual Delta Force

58
00:06:47.92 --> 00:06:54.88
movie the other day, which was way before anybody knew anything about the seal team. So so anyways,

59
00:06:54.88 --> 00:06:59.28
let's get to a man. Let's go back to the beginning. Let's go back to where, how you grew up, where

60
00:06:59.28 --> 00:07:07.44
you're from, what turned you into you? Who conception in Korea? Actually conceived in Korea, conceived in

61
00:07:07.44 --> 00:07:14.000
Korea. That was a Joe army kid. What did you do? So he had two of them, or else is he was a

62
00:07:15.36 --> 00:07:20.40
95 Bravo, which is a military police officer and a Philadelphia artillery guy. What years was he

63
00:07:21.36 --> 00:07:29.36
70, late 70s into the mid 80s? Okay, his, his intent was. Was he, did he go to nom? He didn't.

64
00:07:29.36 --> 00:07:34.72
He was, he was, he was in high school during Vietnam and then by time he got out the war had been

65
00:07:34.72 --> 00:07:41.52
fought. That was over. But he got stationed in Korea at some point. Yeah, I got stationed in Korea

66
00:07:41.52 --> 00:07:47.36
and met my beautiful mother at a very young age. She was 18 years old and then they had me at

67
00:07:47.36 --> 00:07:59.12
19. How old was he? 25, 24 and just living his best life doing the army thing. We actually moved

68
00:07:59.12 --> 00:08:05.84
to California, to Fort Ord, California, where I was born and Monterey. Looks like a zombie apocalypse

69
00:08:05.84 --> 00:08:12.16
there now, the actual base for Ord. Looks like a sim shoot house. Did he get shot down? It did. They

70
00:08:12.16 --> 00:08:16.64
shut down all the buildings, condemned them, but it's still open. Like you could drive through

71
00:08:17.20 --> 00:08:23.60
publicly. So there's no gates. And station in Germany for a period of time with my dad as a young

72
00:08:23.60 --> 00:08:33.60
child and then parent separated. So got to come to Daytona Beach, Florida where I was basically raised.

73
00:08:33.60 --> 00:08:37.12
Going with who'd you go with? Monterey? Monterey? Monterey? Monterey? Monterey?

74
00:08:37.12 --> 00:08:46.08
Speaking of English, Medigay and Germany, wanted up getting back over to the US where I spent

75
00:08:46.08 --> 00:08:52.40
time between Florida and North Carolina, split in the difference growing up. Were you, were you looking

76
00:08:52.40 --> 00:08:56.32
at the army, like good deal? Were you around the army all the time when you're, when you're a little

77
00:08:56.32 --> 00:09:02.16
bit older? Yeah, it's like, you know, we live, you know, these civilian lives now, but there's

78
00:09:02.16 --> 00:09:09.44
always this evidence that we served in some capacity. So I saw that evidence as a child. My dad had

79
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:16.08
the dog tags, the pictures, the moterey gear. I remember playing with his TA50, his old moterey gear,

80
00:09:16.08 --> 00:09:24.08
his mess kit and all of his LBE and all the old stuff that we had, the webbing. And I just kind

81
00:09:24.08 --> 00:09:29.44
of knew growing up in that environment that I was going to be in the military. His brother was a

82
00:09:29.44 --> 00:09:38.000
career, Navy guy. So I was, you know, growing up with Charlie Sheen and Navy Sills and Chuck Norris and

83
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.04
Delta Force and kind of immersed in that and decided at a very young age. I mean, man, it's, it's,

84
00:09:45.04 --> 00:09:50.000
as young as I can remember, that's all I want to do. Was it an altering? Yeah, that's the same with me.

85
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.56
I always say people like, when did you make that decision? I'm like, I don't know, because I just

86
00:09:54.56 --> 00:10:00.40
remember what wanting to wear camouflage uniforms as a little kid. Yeah, that's what I remember.

87
00:10:00.96 --> 00:10:05.36
But you were in mostly growing up in Daytona Beach. Yeah, Daytona Beach and then split in the

88
00:10:05.36 --> 00:10:10.000
difference between North Carolina and my mom actually settled right outside of Fort Brad,

89
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.28
North Carolina, which I would spend a lot of time. What year were you born? 80. So you're growing up.

90
00:10:15.28 --> 00:10:19.92
So now this is like the 90s. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. I'm sitting here talking to you and for some

91
00:10:19.92 --> 00:10:25.44
reason in my mind, I'm thinking I'm talking to like what like an older person. Yeah. And I'm thinking

92
00:10:25.44 --> 00:10:30.48
in my mind like, oh, it was the 50s. I don't know why I'm thinking that because because because

93
00:10:30.48 --> 00:10:34.16
okay, yeah, I guess because yeah, just read JFK, so I'm thinking, oh, yeah, this is the 50s. And

94
00:10:34.16 --> 00:10:38.48
then I started thinking myself, wait a second. This is like I was already in the Navy when you

95
00:10:38.48 --> 00:10:42.96
are freaking teenage or whatever. So you're growing up in the 90s. 90s. What year did you go in the

96
00:10:42.96 --> 00:10:51.92
Navy? 1990. 90. Okay. Yeah. I was 10. Yeah. That was 10. Wow. Wow. Now feel young all this sudden. Yeah. Yeah.

97
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:58.000
Yeah. So what are you doing in Daytona Beach? What's the scene down there? Are you in the water?

98
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.08
Are you surfing? Are you listening to music? What are you listening to? I was, I made my dad

99
00:11:02.08 --> 00:11:07.44
jokes and says that was a part fish because I was always in the water. I mean, I remember training.

100
00:11:07.44 --> 00:11:12.16
I wanted to be a Navy Sil, I first started thinking about the military. My uncle was very

101
00:11:12.16 --> 00:11:17.76
pro-Navy obviously. My dad was pro army and I remember jumping and diving into pools and doing

102
00:11:17.76 --> 00:11:23.76
underwater UDT challenges. Like tie-in knots. You know, there was no discovery channel or there was

103
00:11:23.76 --> 00:11:30.48
no representation, a mainstream of what Navy Sil's did. It was UDT was Charlie Sheen and Navy Sil's.

104
00:11:30.48 --> 00:11:35.76
So I wanted to do that, but I grew up in the water, outdoor fishing, I grew up on a boat.

105
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:41.20
I mean, I think it was out. We probably fish four days a week. What was your dad's civilian job?

106
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:46.16
So he immediately transfer from the military and work for the Department of Corrections for the

107
00:11:46.16 --> 00:11:52.08
state of Florida. So he started doing corrections at an early age, right out of the military,

108
00:11:52.08 --> 00:11:56.08
which transitioned his retirement, but if it's a whole bunch of cool stuff for him,

109
00:11:56.08 --> 00:12:01.36
and that's all our member him doing. And then, is he live? Do you see, is there another like,

110
00:12:01.36 --> 00:12:04.16
does he get remarried or something? Who's taking care of you when he's at work?

111
00:12:04.16 --> 00:12:10.32
Yeah, I mean, if I could reflect on that time period, I think I did a lot of taking care of myself,

112
00:12:11.28 --> 00:12:15.28
but I was super independent. I wasn't only child. So it was just making sure. You know, so

113
00:12:15.84 --> 00:12:21.92
growing up, I had a good imagination. It was very responsible as a kid. I don't remember getting

114
00:12:21.92 --> 00:12:28.16
trouble. I wasn't in bars. I wasn't into weed. All the typical things that kids are into. I remember

115
00:12:28.16 --> 00:12:34.80
like doing con-op, I concepted up the operation plans in brief as a 10-year-old. I had a toy

116
00:12:34.80 --> 00:12:41.04
MP5 and planning ops getting Gucci out and geared up and then doing these like low-vis operations

117
00:12:41.04 --> 00:12:45.52
at night. And then even a or I didn't even know what an A or was. And after action review,

118
00:12:45.52 --> 00:12:49.92
I would come back and like, let's talk about it. Like weird stuff. Who's we? Look, all my friends.

119
00:12:49.92 --> 00:12:53.20
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I was just that kid. Yeah. I was that kid.

120
00:12:53.84 --> 00:12:58.48
Hey, did you? What about the fact that your parents got divorced? Did you? Did you have like

121
00:12:58.48 --> 00:13:04.000
anemosity towards your dad or towards your mom or were you just, did you just kind of,

122
00:13:04.40 --> 00:13:10.24
because when divorce happens at a young age, sometimes kids can't understand it. And it makes them,

123
00:13:10.24 --> 00:13:15.20
you know, I guess, have some kind of anemosity towards one parent or the other. It sounds like

124
00:13:15.20 --> 00:13:19.04
you were pretty maybe you kind of, because you can also, when you get older, you go, yeah, you know what,

125
00:13:19.04 --> 00:13:22.08
they just, you know, they did this when they were a little too young or they didn't get along or they

126
00:13:22.08 --> 00:13:27.28
weren't quite a good fit and I get it and we're going to carry on. Yeah. That was me man. I just never had a,

127
00:13:27.92 --> 00:13:33.36
I never developed anemosity for any of my parents based on the things they weren't potentially doing

128
00:13:33.36 --> 00:13:38.56
right. I don't know if it was because I always taught not to judge people and even my family

129
00:13:38.56 --> 00:13:43.76
and the circumstance I was in. What I looked at, it was a very adaptive opportunity for me to

130
00:13:43.76 --> 00:13:49.36
to go to different places, meet different family members and then have these cool experiences.

131
00:13:49.36 --> 00:13:55.04
I mean, I grew up in World Carolina with my cousins running the streets, doing playing war,

132
00:13:55.84 --> 00:13:59.92
shooting BB guns and then I come back to Florida and then I was hanging out my dad fishing

133
00:13:59.92 --> 00:14:05.76
outdoors on the beach in the water. And so I had a really good childhood. I despite the

134
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:12.08
problem that was separation, which eventually at the age of 12, why did I move him back to my

135
00:14:12.08 --> 00:14:17.28
moms, taking advantage of opportunities there? What was the, what was the opportunity? So

136
00:14:18.72 --> 00:14:24.24
when I went, so my, obviously my mom and dad are in kind of like, cohoots and competition with

137
00:14:24.24 --> 00:14:30.16
each other because they want to have me, you know. And so I'm going back and forth, getting spoiled

138
00:14:30.16 --> 00:14:35.12
and separate ways. But I remember actually a summer of like when I was 12 or 13,

139
00:14:35.76 --> 00:14:40.72
my mom trying to convince me that, hey, you know, your dad just met a new woman, which he did,

140
00:14:40.72 --> 00:14:45.84
which was going to be my step mom, she had three kids at the time. And then it's an allocation

141
00:14:45.84 --> 00:14:50.08
of resources. And you know, when you have three new children in the home, you don't get taken care

142
00:14:50.08 --> 00:14:54.88
of like you used to. And so I was like, yeah, maybe I want to give my mom a chance and live with

143
00:14:54.88 --> 00:14:59.52
my mom and it's a good situation. So I just said dad, I'm, I'm just going to live my mom.

144
00:14:59.52 --> 00:15:05.52
And he was, I remember painfully, he was bummed out. I don't think I've ever heard my dad cry

145
00:15:05.52 --> 00:15:10.40
or saw him cry. And I think he was crying on the phone when I told him that. And it

146
00:15:10.40 --> 00:15:16.08
created a device, because I was his only baby boy. But he had children in the take care of,

147
00:15:16.08 --> 00:15:20.80
he had a new born with the woman that he was with. And I knew he had this life, he had this vertical,

148
00:15:20.80 --> 00:15:27.76
he had a concentrate on. So I live with my mom. And then, you know, in North Carolina, and she wasn't,

149
00:15:27.76 --> 00:15:32.80
she wasn't wealthy at all. She was an entrepreneur, small business, beauty salon. We were struggling.

150
00:15:32.80 --> 00:15:36.64
I thought it was going to be like, oh, this is cool because my mom buys me crap all the time.

151
00:15:36.64 --> 00:15:41.44
My dad never buys me stuff. And so I went into that opportunity and realized, hey, I mean,

152
00:15:41.44 --> 00:15:45.28
me and my mom were going to have to fend for ourselves. And we she with another guy at this point.

153
00:15:45.28 --> 00:15:50.40
She was, she was with my stepdad. She eventually met my stepdad at 15. She had a boyfriend at

154
00:15:50.40 --> 00:15:54.80
the time. Name Alex was a good dude from that she had met in Germany, had brought her over.

155
00:15:55.68 --> 00:16:00.16
But she was trying to find her way. I mean, I don't even think, and this is, this is

156
00:16:00.16 --> 00:16:07.20
uh, uh, honest reflection. I don't think I had shoes until I was like 14. Like I had flipflops.

157
00:16:07.92 --> 00:16:13.28
It was like, she didn't have a car to us 15. Um, because she couldn't afford a car. So we didn't

158
00:16:13.28 --> 00:16:18.56
have a lot of things that were basics because she was grinding as an entrepreneur. But that taught me

159
00:16:18.56 --> 00:16:25.44
more about life moving forward, being adaptive and eventually becoming a military leader. I think

160
00:16:25.44 --> 00:16:30.16
a lot of those experiences come from that. You know, you said, you said, first of all, it's pretty

161
00:16:30.16 --> 00:16:35.84
amazing how you were, um, kind of attach native, able to not be emotional about these decisions and

162
00:16:35.84 --> 00:16:42.56
stuff as a kid. You also said, hey, uh, I was taught not to judge people. Who taught you that?

163
00:16:42.56 --> 00:16:48.000
I grew up as a Baptist and, um, I wasn't, like, I'm not a super religious person. I never

164
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.64
have them. But I've questioned, I'm a crying as a kid when I was in my bed trying to think about

165
00:16:54.64 --> 00:16:59.36
what the next step was for people. Like what happens when you die? I remember I actually,

166
00:16:59.36 --> 00:17:04.80
I remember this thought gives it stuck with me. I said to myself on my head, I said, wait a minute,

167
00:17:04.80 --> 00:17:12.16
if if a God's Jesus is father, then who's God's father? And there's this void in my brain. I'm like,

168
00:17:12.16 --> 00:17:17.36
oh my God, I can't figure this out. And I remember being destroyed. And so religion kind of brought

169
00:17:17.36 --> 00:17:22.56
that together for me. So I grew up like a Christian non-denominational and was taught a lot of

170
00:17:22.56 --> 00:17:28.88
values that way. Also my dad's a military-minded guy. So discipline, integrity, honor, all those things

171
00:17:28.88 --> 00:17:33.76
weren't still that many young age to. And then what, at what point did you, because you were in the

172
00:17:33.76 --> 00:17:40.64
water all the time, and it seems like that would be a good call to go in the Navy and, and try and

173
00:17:40.64 --> 00:17:45.52
go in the SEAL teams. What made you make the decision to go in the Army instead? Yeah, good question.

174
00:17:45.52 --> 00:17:50.72
I, I, I, I never been asked that, but specifically I know the exact moment. I was on my, the

175
00:17:50.72 --> 00:17:58.32
steps of my grandma's house and they don't a beach. And my uncle, who is still active Navy, had just

176
00:17:58.32 --> 00:18:04.40
come back from being on the water and in the fleet. And I was talking to him about being a Navy

177
00:18:04.40 --> 00:18:09.12
SEAL. And he said, listen, I know you're torn between the two. Do you want to be a green

178
00:18:09.12 --> 00:18:13.36
braid? Do you want to be a Navy SEAL? And if I were a kid, it's like, it's a choice, but you don't

179
00:18:13.36 --> 00:18:19.84
realize the progress that you have to go through. And so I'm like, so what happens if I fail?

180
00:18:19.84 --> 00:18:24.88
As a, if I go to selection and, or a good abuds, if I fail, what happens? He goes, you're

181
00:18:24.88 --> 00:18:30.48
mopping a deck forever. He goes, and then he told me about the whole recruitment. He actually

182
00:18:30.48 --> 00:18:35.52
tried out for buds and didn't make it when he was young in the Navy. And he said, hey, there's a

183
00:18:35.52 --> 00:18:41.28
whole bunch of guys I served with that didn't make it, that fill all the slots in the Navy, that

184
00:18:41.28 --> 00:18:46.24
nobody else wants to do. And I'm like, so what happens if I'm in the Army? And then my diet was

185
00:18:46.24 --> 00:18:50.96
there to educate me, says, listen, you could be an airborne ranger, you pass ranger school,

186
00:18:50.96 --> 00:18:55.20
you go to selection, you don't make it, you're still an airborne ranger, combat arms. And I'm

187
00:18:55.20 --> 00:18:59.52
like, why does one be in the fight? And I, I made the decision right there in that moment, it was like,

188
00:18:59.92 --> 00:19:04.64
okay, let me see the path that leads me to be a special forces guy. When I was 10 years old,

189
00:19:04.64 --> 00:19:09.12
I made a bet with my dad that I was going to be a green braid. Damn, better men in P5,

190
00:19:09.12 --> 00:19:18.64
better head of the team. I had to buy myself. You couldn't buy me a Phoenix arm's 22 right now.

191
00:19:20.32 --> 00:19:24.80
The fact that what, what the fact that you were able to calculate that is incredible,

192
00:19:25.44 --> 00:19:32.32
when I, I was freaking, you know, I was like, I think I was 18 when I joined, but I might have been 17

193
00:19:32.32 --> 00:19:38.56
on the maps program. Anyways, I was young, but I was older than you were at age 10, and I didn't even

194
00:19:38.56 --> 00:19:43.92
figure out that, hey, that, that thing never came into mind, mind what if you don't make it.

195
00:19:43.92 --> 00:19:47.92
Yeah, which is a stupid thing to be thinking, because there's a 80% attrition rate in Buds.

196
00:19:48.72 --> 00:19:56.08
And it's totally, it's, it's the worst. I mean, look, here, here's what's the worst. If you join the

197
00:19:56.08 --> 00:20:01.92
Navy because you want to be a mechanic or you want to be a work on aviation equipment, that's

198
00:20:01.92 --> 00:20:06.16
awesome. The, the Navy's freaking a great place to get those kind of jobs that are sort of like

199
00:20:06.16 --> 00:20:10.88
industrial blue collar jobs. The Navy's freaking awesome for that. You, you want to, like I said,

200
00:20:10.88 --> 00:20:15.28
you want to be a diesel mechanic, bro, go, go join the Navy. You'll get awesome experience of that.

201
00:20:15.68 --> 00:20:22.08
You want to learn about communication systems, technical stuff, the Navy's great, but the type of

202
00:20:22.08 --> 00:20:26.96
person that wants to be a seal doesn't want to do those kind of things at all, at least as far as I can tell.

203
00:20:27.52 --> 00:20:33.68
So, let that's what you're going to end up with. And so it's really a bad deal if you don't make it,

204
00:20:33.68 --> 00:20:38.32
it's not, not going to be fun. What's worse, too, you train up for that job before you,

205
00:20:38.32 --> 00:20:44.32
or the use to, right? You used to train up for that job. Yeah. So then what's a good thing is you see

206
00:20:44.32 --> 00:20:48.48
how much that job potentially sucks. Yeah. So when you go into Buds, that's your motivation. I don't

207
00:20:48.48 --> 00:20:53.20
want to go back to that thing, that vocational thing. No, it's, it's, and the other thing that's,

208
00:20:53.20 --> 00:20:57.60
that's really good about the army and the Marine Corps is you get all this fundamental basic

209
00:20:57.60 --> 00:21:04.16
infantry, small unit training before you go to special operations training. So in the, in the

210
00:21:04.16 --> 00:21:09.36
seal teams, you don't have that. You don't have this sort of base of knowledge of fundamental

211
00:21:09.36 --> 00:21:16.24
small unit tactics like you have in the army and in the Marine Corps. So how will you when you

212
00:21:16.24 --> 00:21:22.96
are less 17? Yeah. I joined us 17. And go to boot camp. Got what you expected?

213
00:21:22.96 --> 00:21:28.88
Yeah. I went to infantry boot camp where to sand hill became a 11 Bravo. I actually signed up to

214
00:21:28.88 --> 00:21:34.72
the an airborne Ranger, an option 40 contract, which is known as the option to go to Ranger

215
00:21:34.72 --> 00:21:39.12
Pétain. Oh, so that's, that means you're going to Battalion. Yeah. I was, I was so I set to go to

216
00:21:39.12 --> 00:21:46.32
Battalion. But what I signed up for as an MOS was called 11 X-ray. And 11 X-ray is similar to the 18

217
00:21:46.32 --> 00:21:51.68
X-ray. And where the X stands for, they filled the gap. They, they decide what they want to make

218
00:21:51.68 --> 00:21:56.88
you. So back in the day, it's not like this now. But back in the day, there was four different

219
00:21:56.88 --> 00:22:04.40
specialties in the infantry. 11 Bravo Charlie Delta and Mike. And, or not Mike, not Delta, but Mike

220
00:22:04.40 --> 00:22:10.16
and hotel. So if you were 11 Bravo infantrymen, if you're a Charlie, Mortarmen, if you're a

221
00:22:10.16 --> 00:22:16.96
Mike, like heavy-willed mechanized vehicles, if you're a hotel, heavy armor like Rodin on Humvees.

222
00:22:16.96 --> 00:22:23.44
So basically an infantrymen with different skill sons. Well, when I got there, the way they selected

223
00:22:23.44 --> 00:22:28.24
us in group does was based on where we were standing. So they said, hey, you guys in a group,

224
00:22:28.24 --> 00:22:32.48
you're going to be Bravo's. You mean, you're like literally standing, literally, you're not standing

225
00:22:32.48 --> 00:22:36.56
in your class rank or anything like that. Just wear your stand. Where you were lumped together.

226
00:22:37.12 --> 00:22:41.36
And so they're like, you lumped. You're going to be a Bravo, you know, and they made them

227
00:22:41.36 --> 00:22:47.44
molasses. Well, they made me an 11 hotel. And so I'm like, okay, so I'm going to infantry guy that

228
00:22:47.44 --> 00:22:53.04
drives and Humvees shoots 50 cows and toe muscles. Cool. What do this? At the end of basic training,

229
00:22:53.04 --> 00:23:00.000
where they transition you and they go to AIT where you get your advanced training. They're supposed

230
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.64
to have a rip brief, a Ranger docturnation program brief. So the rip instructor comes and I'm like,

231
00:23:06.64 --> 00:23:10.80
what's going on here? Like he's not talking to us. He's talking to the Bravo's and the Charlie's.

232
00:23:10.80 --> 00:23:14.88
Like why is he talking to us? Don't even think anything about it because I'm like, I mean,

233
00:23:14.88 --> 00:23:20.64
you want, I don't even have a rank, right? And so no, no foot to stand on. So we go through the training

234
00:23:20.64 --> 00:23:25.92
and at the end, they go, hey, Mike, you're going to Fort Lewis Washington to an infantry unit.

235
00:23:25.92 --> 00:23:31.36
And I'm like, I have a Ranger contract, airborne Ranger contract. So they look at my

236
00:23:31.36 --> 00:23:36.40
Amosica, know your hotel. Ranger of a time doesn't have hotels. And I'm like, what? Like,

237
00:23:36.40 --> 00:23:39.52
what do you mean they don't have hotels? And like you should have told us before you were

238
00:23:39.52 --> 00:23:45.28
a day, I came like, I'm a private. I think I tried to say something, but you guys ignored me. So

239
00:23:45.28 --> 00:23:51.84
luckily for me, my uncle was a sergeant major and the 18th Airborne Corps, big division of

240
00:23:52.80 --> 00:23:57.68
airborne infantry units. So I call him during my little break and like this is what happened.

241
00:23:58.24 --> 00:24:04.08
So he gets this, you know, long story short, he gets this connection where this old guard recruiter

242
00:24:04.08 --> 00:24:09.52
comes in. And I'm in a room similar to this. And they're like, I know your uncle, I'm going to

243
00:24:09.52 --> 00:24:14.16
hook you up. Like literally the guy says it to me as a E5. And he's the recruiter for the old guard,

244
00:24:14.16 --> 00:24:19.04
the third infantry regiment, right? I don't even know the hell the old guard is. I'm like, okay,

245
00:24:19.04 --> 00:24:23.52
what do I got to do? And a civilian comes in and he looks at my orders, he's a

246
00:24:23.52 --> 00:24:28.16
Gamer orders and he looks at it. And my MOS has a love no hotel. He literally takes a pen

247
00:24:28.16 --> 00:24:33.36
and scratches out a love no hotel, writes 11 Bravo and then signs his initials boom.

248
00:24:33.36 --> 00:24:38.72
And it instant 11 Bravo. And I'm like, oh, and I'm like, okay, so am I going to be

249
00:24:38.72 --> 00:24:42.64
time and it goes, well, first we can't do that. We have to send you to the old guard because that's

250
00:24:42.64 --> 00:24:48.64
part of this deal. When we send you the old guard because you could only be 11 Bravo going the old

251
00:24:48.64 --> 00:24:53.52
guard. We're going to send you there and then you could put a 41 87. Everybody back in the day,

252
00:24:53.52 --> 00:24:59.12
even kind of now. So see, I 41 87 is the way that you migrate and do whatever you want to do,

253
00:24:59.12 --> 00:25:05.44
natural. So I get the old guard. No idea what the old guard is. And the long story short,

254
00:25:05.44 --> 00:25:10.48
they're ceremony unit of the US military. They do all the fall on our funerals, the state

255
00:25:10.48 --> 00:25:16.72
dignitarious courts. All the stuff I did not want to do. I had to take advantage of my time.

256
00:25:17.28 --> 00:25:26.40
This is pre-GWAT. So I'm like, I'm talking what like 97 97 97 97. So I get there and, you know,

257
00:25:26.40 --> 00:25:32.40
luckily for my circumstance, my uncle is very well known in these units. He served as a

258
00:25:32.40 --> 00:25:36.96
between start, does a storm. He's just a popular character in the inventory in this and these

259
00:25:36.96 --> 00:25:42.56
particular units. And the old guard for infantry guys is like a break. Yeah, you go to Korea, you go to

260
00:25:42.56 --> 00:25:47.92
the 82nd and then you go to the old guard to take a break. So I get there. E1 don't know anything

261
00:25:47.92 --> 00:25:52.24
and I realize it's not the place that I want to be, but I have to take advantage of my time. So I

262
00:25:52.24 --> 00:26:00.72
head on a trajectory to focus on setting myself up for success to be the best version of special forces

263
00:26:01.44 --> 00:26:07.92
that I could be. And so that's where that journey began. Did anyone tell you what to do? Was anyone

264
00:26:07.92 --> 00:26:11.36
talking to you about it? Was anyone telling you about selection or what you need to get ready for?

265
00:26:11.36 --> 00:26:16.80
Anything like that when you're reading about it? So I was so books or had been a big part of my

266
00:26:16.80 --> 00:26:23.28
life since the origins of where I wanted to be in the military. You know, the Marseinco books, the

267
00:26:23.28 --> 00:26:29.84
you know, the the Marine Sniper, all these books, John Plaster, Mac Pisaug, John Strikers stories,

268
00:26:29.84 --> 00:26:36.24
all these stories I was digesting and absorbing. I even stole and basic training a book called

269
00:26:36.24 --> 00:26:43.68
Commandos that was a paperback book from the drill sergeants, Paul Table Hall, while I was doing KP,

270
00:26:43.68 --> 00:26:48.56
I was cleaning crap up. And because I was like, I want to digest this. I was like hiding,

271
00:26:48.56 --> 00:26:56.16
doing that stuff. And so I had an understanding of what it took in discipline, but I had no idea

272
00:26:56.16 --> 00:27:03.84
because I didn't get any intel. As I got into the infantry, I maximized my time. I trained up for

273
00:27:03.84 --> 00:27:07.76
Ranger School. I went to Ranger School as an 18 year old PFC, a private first class. I went to

274
00:27:07.76 --> 00:27:12.88
Airborne School. How hard does it get a billet to Ranger School as an 18 year old? Almost impossible.

275
00:27:12.88 --> 00:27:19.28
How is it getting? So there's there's trials. Most infantry units run what's called pre-Ranger.

276
00:27:19.28 --> 00:27:23.12
And people think, hey, you raise your hand. You get a slot. That's not true. If

277
00:27:23.12 --> 00:27:27.92
you're a baton, it's a requirement. So they get the majority of the slots. If you're a regular

278
00:27:27.92 --> 00:27:34.80
infantry unit, you get slots based on order of merit. So they have an OML list. And if you

279
00:27:34.80 --> 00:27:38.48
earn it, they'll give you a slot. And then you're on the list. And then you just trickle your way

280
00:27:38.48 --> 00:27:43.68
to the top. So I tried out for it about 30 of us tried out for us and only three of us got slots.

281
00:27:43.68 --> 00:27:48.80
And I was a young PFC. What's it? What's the trial based on? Freak and PTC testing? It

282
00:27:48.80 --> 00:27:53.68
opens a sample here or something. What's harder than Ranger School? So it's about a week.

283
00:27:53.68 --> 00:27:59.12
Right? So in a week, it's like how much crap can we put together in a week to crush these kids

284
00:27:59.12 --> 00:28:04.08
dig to see who's most likely to succeed? Because these units have the reputation on the line.

285
00:28:04.08 --> 00:28:08.96
If the third image of your regiment sends five dudes to Ranger School and nobody passes, it

286
00:28:08.96 --> 00:28:16.08
reflects poorly on the on the regiment. So when I showed up, it was a rucksack. It was a, you know,

287
00:28:16.08 --> 00:28:23.76
a ruck march, 12 miles in time. It was land navigation. It was a common core task. It was patrolling.

288
00:28:23.76 --> 00:28:27.44
The number one thing that's going to make you successful is that your physical fitness in

289
00:28:27.44 --> 00:28:32.16
Ranger School. It's your ability to lead. And so as a young 18 year old at the time,

290
00:28:32.16 --> 00:28:38.48
I'm navigating this problem set. It's like, hey, PFC, Glover, give a warno. Give a con op. And I'm like,

291
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:45.44
oh, like I have to brief this. So planning and then executing that raid was a reflection of your

292
00:28:45.44 --> 00:28:51.04
probability of success in Ranger School. So I was successful. And you're a PFC and there's 30

293
00:28:51.04 --> 00:28:56.24
people try out and you get selected. I got selected. Now I was one of one of three that I got selected.

294
00:28:56.24 --> 00:29:00.24
We went to Ranger School. I was actually the only one at the three that went all the way through

295
00:29:00.24 --> 00:29:07.44
without recycling. And in my infantry company, the only people Ranger Qualified was me as a PFC

296
00:29:07.44 --> 00:29:13.84
and my first sergeant who was a senior E8 in the army. So it was back then it was rare. I was

297
00:29:13.84 --> 00:29:21.52
rared to have a Ranger tab on your uniform. How was Ranger School? Kick in the balls, kick in the balls.

298
00:29:23.44 --> 00:29:29.92
Fear was the thing that I had to overcome. It was the most difficult thing that I had overcome.

299
00:29:29.92 --> 00:29:34.96
I remember like the night before Ranger School. Fear, I'm assuming fear of failure. Fear of failure.

300
00:29:34.96 --> 00:29:41.44
Absolutely. And you know, you have no perspective. You just have these stories. You know,

301
00:29:41.44 --> 00:29:45.28
my squad leader had been Ranger School before. So he was feeding me information, which almost makes

302
00:29:45.28 --> 00:29:52.32
it worse. You got to be aware of this and you're trying to live with that solution in mind.

303
00:29:52.80 --> 00:29:58.08
And you're getting hit with all these other random jobs in the face. I showed up and I'm super

304
00:29:58.08 --> 00:30:04.24
physically fit. And I remember getting my, um, I had a low body fat, high physical fitness score.

305
00:30:04.88 --> 00:30:10.32
And when I got there, I realized very quickly it wasn't about that. It was a, that's a,

306
00:30:10.32 --> 00:30:14.96
the Ranger Assessment part of Ranger School is relatively easy. I mean, it's we're talking

307
00:30:14.96 --> 00:30:21.04
eight minute mile pace, five miles, 40 minutes. We're talking about basic pushups, situps, and running,

308
00:30:21.04 --> 00:30:26.08
pullups, and basic stuff. Really quickly, you start deteriorating because you're not eating.

309
00:30:26.08 --> 00:30:31.84
Uh, you're averaging about one in our rear day when I went during winter time. And you're averaging

310
00:30:31.84 --> 00:30:36.64
about three and a half hours of sleep. Those difficulties for a dude. I mean, I went to Ranger

311
00:30:36.64 --> 00:30:42.000
School. I was even as an 18 year old at 200 pounds. All the guys that were meat heads that were

312
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.88
big dudes suffered the most because you need protein to feed muscle. And when you're not getting

313
00:30:48.88 --> 00:30:54.08
that, your body starts deteriorating. And it's painful. How much weight did you lose? 30 pounds.

314
00:30:54.08 --> 00:31:02.88
30 pounds. Yeah, that's a good time. Yeah. And that's another thing. Man, I might have taken the

315
00:31:02.88 --> 00:31:07.60
gamble. You know, they're like, hey, listen, Jocco, you might end up on a ship somewhere. But

316
00:31:08.08 --> 00:31:12.32
if you go to Ranger School, guaranteed you're not eating out of my, let me take a bubble.

317
00:31:13.92 --> 00:31:18.40
Roll the dice. Yeah. That's another ball game. That's the thing about buds. The thing about

318
00:31:18.40 --> 00:31:23.52
buds, you're getting fat, man. Yeah. And it's all you can eat. That's beautiful. Yeah. It's

319
00:31:23.52 --> 00:31:30.48
saved. It's why you jacked. That's huge. But the thing is Ranger School, like you said, Ranger

320
00:31:30.48 --> 00:31:37.76
School is really the premier leadership school for the Army. It is. Yeah. You're running operations.

321
00:31:37.76 --> 00:31:43.36
You're, you're, you're filling a different role. Basically, every operation. Sometimes you're the

322
00:31:43.36 --> 00:31:48.64
leader. Sometimes you're freaking machine gun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, when I went to

323
00:31:48.64 --> 00:31:55.04
Ranger School as a very young kid, I didn't know what to expect. And then it's Sinker Swim.

324
00:31:55.36 --> 00:32:00.24
You either step up to the plate and you're prepared to be, look, the characteristics of

325
00:32:00.24 --> 00:32:05.52
being successful, Ranger who aren't that difficult. But being a clear, concise, decisive leader

326
00:32:06.48 --> 00:32:14.08
under stress is super important. And I saw, and in front, for, you know, comparably to all my peers,

327
00:32:14.08 --> 00:32:18.64
which weren't peers. I'm talking about the second lieutenant that just graduated IOBC,

328
00:32:18.64 --> 00:32:24.16
infantry officer, basic horse, Navy seals, green berets. Like these are guys that are highly

329
00:32:24.16 --> 00:32:29.28
respect. So it was a whole plethora, like a melting pot of a whole bunch of different backgrounds.

330
00:32:29.68 --> 00:32:35.28
And I realized when you took away food, when you took away sleep, when you broke everybody down,

331
00:32:35.28 --> 00:32:40.80
we were on this equal plane. And so they're very minimal characteristics that you needed to be

332
00:32:40.80 --> 00:32:48.000
successful and to shine. We're not that difficult. And so I saw people, Sink and I saw people succeed

333
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.92
because they swam. Those people that sunk were just, they couldn't make decisions. And then when

334
00:32:53.92 --> 00:32:59.52
they got stressed, which they never been tested and stressed, they couldn't do basic skills. That's

335
00:32:59.52 --> 00:33:04.16
right. So Ranger School, they give you the formula. And here's the conup. Here's the five paragraph

336
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:10.08
op water. Here's how you execute a rate. Just follow that step by step and you'll be successful.

337
00:33:10.08 --> 00:33:15.12
And I realized how analytic that was. And so I just needed to get through and check the block and get

338
00:33:15.12 --> 00:33:22.48
it done. And I saw a lot of people Sink that I highly respected because they started falling apart.

339
00:33:22.48 --> 00:33:28.64
I mean, I saw guys who were beef, beefy dudes were jacked, who were strong. And they were getting

340
00:33:28.64 --> 00:33:33.60
broken down the most because they couldn't handle the deprivation of sleeping food. And when I saw

341
00:33:33.60 --> 00:33:40.000
that as a young man, as a young leader, it changed my entire perspective on life. Like it reprioritized

342
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.76
the hierarchy of things that I thought were important. And I'm like, that's not important. Like a

343
00:33:43.76 --> 00:33:49.52
hit, like eating, eating and sleeping in the field to be able to conduct an operation are now

344
00:33:49.52 --> 00:33:55.44
the new priorities for me taking care of my guys. So I came out of that as a very young leader

345
00:33:55.44 --> 00:33:59.52
who wasn't even an, that was an informal leader. I wasn't even a designated leader. And that

346
00:33:59.52 --> 00:34:03.60
shaped me to become the leader that I would become. When you say people that would have trouble

347
00:34:03.60 --> 00:34:07.60
where people that would have in hard time making a decision. Like what would they be having a hard

348
00:34:07.60 --> 00:34:12.16
time making a decision? Like, hey, there's where we're going to put this over watch position or where

349
00:34:12.16 --> 00:34:17.52
we're going to set up the base element like those kind of decisions? Yeah, everything from technical

350
00:34:17.52 --> 00:34:23.92
to very cognitive decisions that had been made in adapting to change rapidly. So in Rainer School,

351
00:34:23.92 --> 00:34:27.76
you're going to set mission, which is based off your con up that you plan. It's a deliberate

352
00:34:27.76 --> 00:34:32.56
mission sent, contingency base mission sent. You go in the field with that and then after that,

353
00:34:32.56 --> 00:34:38.32
it's all fragos. It's fragmentation orders of the missions changing. We're doing this. And mostly

354
00:34:38.32 --> 00:34:43.92
how to do with the adaptability of adapting to rapid change. Hey guys, this just happened.

355
00:34:43.92 --> 00:34:48.40
Now you have the doubt what you're going to do. I have no idea. It was probably a lack of glucose

356
00:34:48.40 --> 00:34:55.92
in the brain. It was a lack of sleep. I mean, I had guys that broke down and like just quit.

357
00:34:55.92 --> 00:35:01.04
Because when you get to that state where you can't function mentally, what's going to get you through

358
00:35:01.04 --> 00:35:07.36
that? And typically it's grip. It's resolved. It's digging deep. And some of those guys never found that.

359
00:35:07.36 --> 00:35:12.16
And even though they were tested and they had an opportunity, they never found it. So when we

360
00:35:12.16 --> 00:35:16.96
came out of the field, the greatest thing about Rainer School is your judge by your peers.

361
00:35:17.76 --> 00:35:22.72
You write down on a piece of paper. At the like the second you come out of the field,

362
00:35:22.72 --> 00:35:27.68
your smoked out of your mind. They put you in a classroom. They sit you down with a piece of paper.

363
00:35:27.68 --> 00:35:33.20
And they say, write down a person you want to go to war with and write down a person you leave behind.

364
00:35:33.68 --> 00:35:41.04
And that's that's super impactful for a young man being told that they would be left behind

365
00:35:41.04 --> 00:35:46.08
by the majority of their peers. That's I mean, it's super impactful. Because it's like,

366
00:35:46.08 --> 00:35:53.20
hey man, adapt, change. Do some self reflection or fail. And just be that guy for the rest of your life.

367
00:35:53.20 --> 00:35:57.68
That that right there set the press and it's for everything. And in Ranger School,

368
00:35:58.32 --> 00:36:02.88
one of the ways that you could drop is by getting peered out, right? Where if you get, if you get

369
00:36:02.88 --> 00:36:07.92
ranked the lowest guy X number of times, then the instructors are like, yeah, this guy is not the guy

370
00:36:07.92 --> 00:36:14.08
that we want. If you get peered and it's becoming a routine out of the field, you will immediately get recycled.

371
00:36:14.08 --> 00:36:19.12
So a recycle isn't just like going back to the beginning of that phase. It's potentially going

372
00:36:19.12 --> 00:36:23.68
back to the beginning of Ranger School. So now you're talking about, when I went to Ranger School

373
00:36:23.68 --> 00:36:27.92
with 70 plus days, it was a couple months, three different phases when I went Darby,

374
00:36:28.96 --> 00:36:34.08
which is then the Fort Benning and San Hill, Delana Gow, which is in the mountains, and then

375
00:36:34.08 --> 00:36:41.20
at Eglend, which is in the swamps. So if you get recycled, you potentially will go back to the phase

376
00:36:41.20 --> 00:36:47.28
or go back to the very beginning. I mean, I interviewed a woman Lisa Jaster, who is one of the first

377
00:36:47.28 --> 00:36:54.000
females to go through Ranger School. She failed every phase. She got to the last phase and failed,

378
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.16
and they said, you failed. So here's your options. It was a weird thing, knock out these push-ups

379
00:37:00.16 --> 00:37:04.32
because we get a assess if you're physically a fit to go ahead and go forward. If you don't knock

380
00:37:04.32 --> 00:37:09.60
him out and you can't meet that standard right now, you're done. But we're going to recycle you

381
00:37:09.60 --> 00:37:15.68
to the very beginning. So she was in a race over like a year. Like sustained combat operations

382
00:37:15.68 --> 00:37:20.24
and sleep and food deprived for like a year. And I can't imagine, but that was your options. It's

383
00:37:20.24 --> 00:37:25.28
either, again, it's either synchronous one. You have an opportunity to succeed and change the way you

384
00:37:25.28 --> 00:37:29.84
look at yourself, which I think is the most impactful that they give you that opportunity, or continue

385
00:37:29.84 --> 00:37:35.36
to be that guy, and then you just get shit canned. When are they helping people out by, let's say you

386
00:37:35.36 --> 00:37:39.52
get graded low? Isn't instructor going to be coming over to you and say, like, hey, listen,

387
00:37:39.52 --> 00:37:42.96
here's what's going on. You're really indecisive. You need to start thinking through these things.

388
00:37:42.96 --> 00:37:49.28
The reason I'm asking you this is because like in basic seal training. First of all, you're not

389
00:37:49.28 --> 00:37:54.96
doing anything really tactical. But second of all, there's no real hate, bro. Here's the mistake

390
00:37:54.96 --> 00:37:59.76
that you're making. Whereas the kind of training that I ran, which was like the advanced training,

391
00:37:59.76 --> 00:38:05.60
like the training that we do with platoons before we went to point it, right? I mean, that's all

392
00:38:05.60 --> 00:38:11.52
I'm doing this being like, hey, man, you can't be sitting there, being indecisive. You need to figure

393
00:38:11.52 --> 00:38:13.84
out what's your work, call you're going to make. You need to do at least give your guys some

394
00:38:13.84 --> 00:38:18.000
correction. Like, I'm constantly doing that to these guys. Is that happening at Ranger School?

395
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.44
Or is it more like, yeah, you know what, this guy ain't got it. Yeah, I mean, here, the reality is

396
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:28.80
they know if you're not going to make it. Your peers know the students know. There's guys who are

397
00:38:28.80 --> 00:38:34.32
made for war, and there's guys who aren't made for war. And one of the things that I think is

398
00:38:34.32 --> 00:38:39.92
important about the Ranger tab and the experience is you're creating combat leaders represented by

399
00:38:39.92 --> 00:38:46.56
a tab. Now, now we don't wear tabs necessarily all over the place because we're in different uniforms,

400
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:51.92
but when you saw that tab, you understood that, that guy was capable as a leader in combat.

401
00:38:51.92 --> 00:38:57.36
And it totaled a lot. So a lot of the times, especially with the officers who come out at IOBC,

402
00:38:57.36 --> 00:39:02.000
they're brand new 22 year old, uh, second lieutenant. Don't give them the opportunity. And they'll

403
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.64
say, hey, these are the fixes fix this. If you don't fix it, you're going to fail. You go to

404
00:39:06.64 --> 00:39:10.40
you report to your first duty station as an infantry officer without a Ranger tab, forget about it.

405
00:39:10.40 --> 00:39:16.000
Your career failed for the, you're just not, you might as well just get out. For, for a young

406
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.28
Joe's like PFCs that I was for specialists or even young, uh, NCOs, not commission officers,

407
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.76
you have an opportunity. They'll give you some feedback and they expect to see you, um,

408
00:39:27.76 --> 00:39:33.52
take that opportunity. You might not get another opportunity based on the cycle of getting patrols,

409
00:39:33.52 --> 00:39:38.08
which just means they're going to recycle. And you'll get another chance, uh, a month and a half

410
00:39:38.08 --> 00:39:41.76
later, because that's how long it takes to get through it. What's the nutrition rate at Ranger's

411
00:39:41.76 --> 00:39:45.20
goal? It's pretty high. It's about ID percent. Really. Yeah, that's about 80 percent.

412
00:39:47.20 --> 00:39:51.60
So you get, you get down with it. And now you must have a pretty freaking good reputation. What

413
00:39:51.60 --> 00:40:01.36
do you, are you 19 yet? I'm 19. Yeah. 19. You graduated from that. So what's next? So, um, my uncle,

414
00:40:01.36 --> 00:40:08.08
um, when I'm there, was a guard, the two with the unknown soldier. He was there as a guard. He was a

415
00:40:08.08 --> 00:40:13.84
battoon sergeant, um, before my time. And when I'm there, I put a 4180 something going to

416
00:40:13.84 --> 00:40:18.88
Ranger for time. It doesn't get accepted. They're like, no, I have a Ranger tab, which I thought was

417
00:40:18.88 --> 00:40:23.68
the prerequisite to get a 4180. They're like, no, uh, we don't, we don't need the numbers. And in

418
00:40:23.68 --> 00:40:29.84
98, they didn't need the numbers. 99. And so I talked to my uncle, I'm like, what do you want?

419
00:40:29.84 --> 00:40:34.40
What are my options? Like, I'm ready to be in the fight, which there wasn't a fight. And that's

420
00:40:34.40 --> 00:40:39.84
probably the reason why I think you have 4187 approved. They're like, um, he's like, go, go

421
00:40:39.84 --> 00:40:46.96
try out for the two. And at the time, um, and still at that unit, the two million-known soldier

422
00:40:46.96 --> 00:40:51.76
was the most difficult. It's probably the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life to be honest.

423
00:40:51.76 --> 00:40:58.08
Selections and special operations comparatively were walking the park, compared to what that was.

424
00:40:58.08 --> 00:41:03.92
I went there. The army's been guarding the two of the unknowns since the, the 50s.

425
00:41:04.48 --> 00:41:10.88
It's been around since the, uh, in term of the World War I of known. And it was an honor.

426
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:16.64
It was something that was going to build me and set me up for success, leading into,

427
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:20.96
potentially, behind or special forces. And so I took the opportunity. I went and tried out.

428
00:41:21.92 --> 00:41:23.04
How long is the trial?

429
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:30.40
So you typically do a two week trial. It's called TTY. They just, they TTY to the tomb.

430
00:41:30.40 --> 00:41:35.36
You do a whole bunch of assessments. And then they go, you're good enough or you're not to continue

431
00:41:35.36 --> 00:41:41.36
to select and try. And that's a seven in the nine month process. If you're smart, seven months,

432
00:41:41.36 --> 00:41:46.88
if you're not so smart, not once. So it took me like 10 months. So it took me a long time to get my

433
00:41:46.88 --> 00:41:50.72
earned my two-man-dentification badge. But the, the, the process is almost a year.

434
00:41:50.72 --> 00:41:56.48
And then what's that job in tail? I mean, obviously we know what it looks like from the outside.

435
00:41:56.48 --> 00:41:59.52
Yeah, garden the tomb. But what's it look like from the inside?

436
00:42:00.08 --> 00:42:04.72
It's a suckfest man. It's a suckfest. I mean, it's, it's the most difficult thing I've done.

437
00:42:05.76 --> 00:42:09.52
But the most honorable, uh, responsibility I've been given in the military.

438
00:42:09.92 --> 00:42:14.48
So the two-man-dentone soldiers who've been guarded by the army since the, the 40s.

439
00:42:14.48 --> 00:42:21.28
And they guard the tomb 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And that rotation takes place

440
00:42:21.92 --> 00:42:26.72
and three release based on height. First being the tall, second being the mid, mid guys,

441
00:42:26.72 --> 00:42:33.28
and third being the shortest, minimum six feet tall. And then you rotate basically a firefighter

442
00:42:33.28 --> 00:42:37.28
schedule. Day on day off, day on day off, day on and four days off all year round. You know,

443
00:42:37.28 --> 00:42:42.96
your schedule for three years in advance. And you typically guard if you're a guard, you have your

444
00:42:42.96 --> 00:42:49.28
badge during the summertime, seven walks a day, uh, 30 minute walks with a seven-minute guard change.

445
00:42:49.28 --> 00:42:54.64
And then about two to four hours of guard rotations at night. At night we don't do it in ceremony,

446
00:42:54.64 --> 00:43:00.40
uniform. It's typically class. I think bees at the time, more BDUs. And it's a roving patrol.

447
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:05.04
Your job is simply to guard the tomb of the unknown soldier from desecration or disrespect.

448
00:43:06.08 --> 00:43:11.60
And we do that, uh, snow, sleet, he doesn't matter the weather. It's, it's just being done.

449
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:19.44
What makes it so challenging to get through the, is it just like microscopic inspections of your

450
00:43:19.44 --> 00:43:24.24
uniforms and your hair and your freaking nose hairs and your hair here, your hairs and stuff like that?

451
00:43:24.24 --> 00:43:28.72
Yeah, it's, it's the attention of detail. Line six of the sit-less creed states, my standard

452
00:43:28.72 --> 00:43:34.16
will remain perfection. And so you build this culture around paying attention to every single

453
00:43:34.16 --> 00:43:39.28
facet of your military uniform, even your life, even your personal life, of being squared away.

454
00:43:39.28 --> 00:43:47.20
So I, I did that job and, um, you know, painful to be a new guy doing that job.

455
00:43:47.84 --> 00:43:53.68
But inspections of your uniform every single day, if not by the hour, they have a culture where you

456
00:43:53.68 --> 00:43:58.000
earn a walk. You don't just get a walk, you have to earn that walk. So you have to earn it by

457
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.12
understanding knowledge, yet the verbate a memorized 28 pages of knowledge about the tomb of the

458
00:44:03.12 --> 00:44:07.36
unknown soldier and the history of our international cemetery. Because you're represented. If you're

459
00:44:07.36 --> 00:44:12.08
like, you can go down to do a tomb guard walk and front of 3000 people come inside the quarters,

460
00:44:12.08 --> 00:44:16.72
change and go out three minutes later and communicate the tomb of the unknown to whatever

461
00:44:16.72 --> 00:44:22.88
it presents to the US military. So it's a, it's a diplomatic position, not just a guard

462
00:44:22.88 --> 00:44:29.20
wearing a uniform walking back and forth. And so I remember, my first walk was in front of 3000

463
00:44:29.20 --> 00:44:35.84
people at 12 o'clock noon, CNN, Fox News, cameras weren't in my face. I remember hearing standing

464
00:44:35.84 --> 00:44:40.96
at poor arms hearing the band at rattle on my weapon. Because you're free to nervous because I was

465
00:44:40.96 --> 00:44:45.28
nervous. I was standing in for, I mean, I'm looking through AVator glasses that are in my peripheral

466
00:44:45.84 --> 00:44:51.52
and see people like inches from me, just staring at me and every movement during the

467
00:44:51.52 --> 00:44:58.40
gorge change has to be perfect. And it's intimidating. But it's a sharp learning curve. And again,

468
00:44:58.40 --> 00:45:02.24
it's a huge opportunity for me. So the training program or the selection program that you're talking

469
00:45:02.24 --> 00:45:07.36
about that, that's 10 months long. Are you working during that time? Are you doing any guarding?

470
00:45:07.36 --> 00:45:13.52
Or no. You're doing all the guard walks where there's nobody going to watch any. Early morning,

471
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:18.96
late afternoon and everything at night. I even did what's called a visual because I wanted to get the

472
00:45:18.96 --> 00:45:25.52
hell away from the guys and I didn't want to get hazed and abused. I did visuals where I would work

473
00:45:25.52 --> 00:45:30.64
all day. And so I'm, you know, helping prep the guards, you know, forms doing early morning,

474
00:45:30.64 --> 00:45:37.44
late afternoon walks. And then at night, I'm taking when they cemetery closes at 7pm until 7

475
00:45:37.44 --> 00:45:42.88
in the morning, standing guard for 12 hours straight, no sleep and guarding just to get away from

476
00:45:42.88 --> 00:45:47.76
the guys. I was like breaking records of doing that. I was like doing 21 visuals back and back.

477
00:45:47.76 --> 00:45:55.68
So what was going on with the guys that was so bad? Was it just freaking all in your shit all day long?

478
00:45:55.68 --> 00:46:01.84
Well, the, so the, the two of the unknown soldier, the actual badge is the least awarded badge

479
00:46:01.84 --> 00:46:06.40
in the US military besides the astronauts badge because, you know, they're not a diamond dozen,

480
00:46:06.40 --> 00:46:16.16
military. So the, Tim guard badge is, is very, um, much protected by the Tim guard badge protectors.

481
00:46:16.72 --> 00:46:20.88
And so they don't want the right guys there or the wrong guys there, they want the right guys,

482
00:46:20.88 --> 00:46:26.88
and they, they want to make sure you earn it. And I did and back then, you know, hazing.

483
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:32.40
We come from the military where hazing was normal. I mean, if you weren't hazed, you, you didn't

484
00:46:32.40 --> 00:46:37.76
feel like you were loved. Like, I got my EID, my airborne wings, my halo wings, punched into my chest,

485
00:46:37.76 --> 00:46:43.84
my every rank punched in my collarbone into the bone. And that was just the, the universe we,

486
00:46:43.84 --> 00:46:50.000
uh, evolved in. That was very much the case. Everything from running through the cemetery trying to find

487
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.32
you know, inscriptions of, of specific people getting smoked to death, low crawl on across,

488
00:46:56.32 --> 00:47:02.08
you know, face down in the lawn, getting, you know, getting smoked, um, just routine hazing to make sure,

489
00:47:02.08 --> 00:47:07.84
hey, this is a work, work testing to evaluate you constantly if you want to be here.

490
00:47:07.84 --> 00:47:12.80
And it's something I guess is handed down in tradition. What's the award ceremony like when you finally

491
00:47:12.80 --> 00:47:18.56
get the badge? Not, not that big of a deal. I mean, it's pretty, I, I just saw a picture of it. I have

492
00:47:18.56 --> 00:47:25.52
a small four by six picture of it. And, um, the third relief or the third, if the true

493
00:47:25.52 --> 00:47:30.16
regimen commander comes down in 06 and he pins your badge on you in the morning. And typically you

494
00:47:30.16 --> 00:47:35.84
worked the whole night to take your, you take your badge test, which is a series of specific tests,

495
00:47:35.84 --> 00:47:41.84
including changing the guard at noon, uh, reading verbatim the 28 pages of knowledge,

496
00:47:42.72 --> 00:47:48.32
with no errors, being perfect. And a written test all kinds of stuff. And then you get your badge

497
00:47:48.32 --> 00:47:54.72
pin and, you know, I'm badge 470 out of probably about, uh, almost 600 badges today.

498
00:47:56.32 --> 00:48:00.64
Then how long did you have that job for? Not long. I did it for about a year and a half

499
00:48:00.64 --> 00:48:06.48
afterwards. And then so for a year and a half after you went through nine months of this shit,

500
00:48:06.48 --> 00:48:10.40
yeah, they're like, okay, and this is what you're doing. That's your job. That's your job.

501
00:48:10.96 --> 00:48:15.76
And how did you like it? So I love the honor of the duty.

502
00:48:15.76 --> 00:48:22.72
Um, but it's not what I wanted to do in the military. I, you know, one thing we had to do is maintain

503
00:48:22.72 --> 00:48:28.16
our, um, common core skill sets. So we would come out of the field and those three days down,

504
00:48:28.16 --> 00:48:34.80
we do med training, we do raids, patrolling, we had to maintain all these things. So you get the

505
00:48:34.80 --> 00:48:40.000
inventory experience as a part-time position representing the army in a full-time position.

506
00:48:40.56 --> 00:48:44.72
And it's not what I sign up for. I mean, I was trying to be the best that I could be,

507
00:48:44.72 --> 00:48:49.44
be all you could be was the model back then. But it's not what I sign up for. And then nine

508
00:48:49.44 --> 00:48:55.20
eleven changed everything for me in that, in that situation. But where were you stationed when nine

509
00:48:55.20 --> 00:49:02.88
eleven went down? So I was, so I got out of the army. My first, uh, rotation of four years.

510
00:49:02.88 --> 00:49:09.76
September 3rd of 01 was my ETS day. Get out of our update. I transitioned into the National Guard

511
00:49:09.76 --> 00:49:14.96
because I was going to college and was a squad leader in the inventory. What was your plan? Like

512
00:49:15.68 --> 00:49:20.40
federal Bureau of Investigation HRT? I was like, if there's no war, if I can't get into

513
00:49:20.40 --> 00:49:24.80
the Italian, I'm going to get my college degree and I'm going to go, I'm going to be a sniper in

514
00:49:24.80 --> 00:49:31.52
HRT. Um, and that was my, my sights were set on that. And when nine eleven happened, it was a week

515
00:49:31.52 --> 00:49:39.68
after my ETS. And how old are you now? 21. So you're 21 years old. You get out on September 3rd,

516
00:49:39.68 --> 00:49:48.16
September 3rd is when I left the army. Okay. So then what do you do? So September 11th comes.

517
00:49:48.16 --> 00:49:53.12
Now you're freaking, you got to go and go and be a jerk. I'm freaking out. Like, when September 11th

518
00:49:53.12 --> 00:49:58.32
happened, I was the National Guard and I knew the nasty guard was going to get mobile last.

519
00:49:58.32 --> 00:50:01.44
And I'm like, I'm not going to work these to no offense to the National Guard. But I'm like, I

520
00:50:01.44 --> 00:50:07.92
did not go into work these dudes. I immediately, like I took, I was at college in the cafeteria

521
00:50:07.92 --> 00:50:13.04
in Fateful, near Fort Braggon, Carolina, when this happened. I went home and threw my battle dress

522
00:50:13.04 --> 00:50:18.40
uniform in the washer and started packing my stuff because I'm like, we're going to war. This is it.

523
00:50:19.20 --> 00:50:22.88
And immediately, I started making phone calls and they're like, yeah, and do another man.

524
00:50:22.88 --> 00:50:26.88
Nothing's going on with us right now. Stand by to standby. And I'm like, I have to make moves.

525
00:50:26.88 --> 00:50:33.36
So I started reaching out to recruiters and very rapidly, got back in the military and went straight

526
00:50:33.36 --> 00:50:36.72
to selection. We straight to Greenbrake. Was it hard to get to go straight to selection?

527
00:50:36.72 --> 00:50:42.000
They don't have to been lines out the door at that point. In impossible. I was a, I was a 20 year old

528
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.36
E5. I mean, I made sergeant at 20 years old Airborne Ranger qualified with a tomb guard badge.

529
00:50:47.92 --> 00:50:53.52
And when I showed up to recruiter, he looked at me like I was a 16 year old kid who wanted to play

530
00:50:53.52 --> 00:50:59.84
Army. And I was like, is there's not a thing. And at that time, they hadn't even worked out this whole

531
00:50:59.84 --> 00:51:04.80
thing where guys who were prior servers come back in and serve. And I'm like, dude, I just got out last

532
00:51:04.80 --> 00:51:10.32
week. And he's like, sorry man, you gotta start over. And so I'm duck walking barefoot with a whole bunch of

533
00:51:10.32 --> 00:51:14.56
teenagers, I'm trying to get back in the Army. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, oh, because you had to go back

534
00:51:14.56 --> 00:51:19.28
through like the recruiting process or very beginning. I mean, I had to go to basic AIT. I had a

535
00:51:19.28 --> 00:51:23.84
ranger task. I don't have to do any of that stuff. But I had to go back through the Army and

536
00:51:23.84 --> 00:51:30.80
processing system called 30 F.A.G. From the beginning. I'm duck walking and I actually went to

537
00:51:30.80 --> 00:51:37.44
the recruiting station, which is called maps is where they had processed you in military uniform.

538
00:51:37.44 --> 00:51:42.88
And I remember they brought us on the room and everybody stripped down. And guys are looking at me.

539
00:51:42.88 --> 00:51:47.44
And I'm battle dress uniform stripping down and they like, what is this dude doing? Like,

540
00:51:47.44 --> 00:51:52.80
isn't he a recruiter? Like, what is happening? And I'm, you know, in my boxer briefs, like everybody

541
00:51:52.80 --> 00:51:57.84
else duck walking and doing all my little drills to get back in the Army. And then you go straight to

542
00:51:57.84 --> 00:52:03.92
selection from there. So I went through a program basically in 18 next-rate program and I had a

543
00:52:03.92 --> 00:52:09.44
try out where special operations preparation course they evaluate like they did in me in

544
00:52:09.44 --> 00:52:15.76
ranger school and said, hey, is this kid? Is there a probability that he's going to be successful?

545
00:52:15.76 --> 00:52:21.44
Let's evaluate him in land nav. Let's rock him. Let's p-t-m. And if he's good, we'll give him a slot.

546
00:52:21.44 --> 00:52:27.52
And so that's prep you just said prep. It's basically the preparation for

547
00:52:28.40 --> 00:52:32.96
giving guys slots to go to selection because they just want to throw you into selection and have

548
00:52:32.96 --> 00:52:37.52
you fail. They're setting you up for success. And so I quickly evaluate and they're like,

549
00:52:37.52 --> 00:52:41.68
hey, the streets ready. Let's send him now. How long is that little evaluation?

550
00:52:41.68 --> 00:52:48.96
A week. Okay. It's not straightforward. And then you go to selection and selection.

551
00:52:49.52 --> 00:52:54.80
This initial selection is only a few weeks long, right? When I went out to selection, it was 21,

552
00:52:54.80 --> 00:53:01.04
22 days. Yeah, a few weeks. And this is just sort of weeding people out. Yeah. And so you

553
00:53:01.04 --> 00:53:06.40
make it sure you want to be there. Yeah. I mean, at the time you had to have, and you had to have

554
00:53:06.40 --> 00:53:10.80
three years in the Army. So you're talking about experience, typically in CO's, not commission officers,

555
00:53:10.80 --> 00:53:16.80
or junior-listed guys who have experience in the military. And you show up. It's a week of assessment,

556
00:53:16.80 --> 00:53:22.48
land-of, all these gates to make sure that you're good to go. And then it's team week. It's basically

557
00:53:22.48 --> 00:53:28.48
a little mini version of how week. And then they do the long-range movement. The long-range movement

558
00:53:28.48 --> 00:53:33.52
is what gets everybody. It's the land navigation leading into a long-range movement, where they

559
00:53:33.52 --> 00:53:40.64
assess your ability as an individual to learn a skill set and then in the wood line alone execute

560
00:53:40.64 --> 00:53:45.04
that skill set to be successful. And that skill set is just land-of. Land-of. We need to be there.

561
00:53:45.04 --> 00:53:50.48
It's our trick. It's like you guys' water we use land and hate can you hump for a long period

562
00:53:50.48 --> 00:53:56.56
of time duration, day, night, and keep movement and can you find your points? And just like the

563
00:53:56.56 --> 00:54:00.88
water, there's a lot of people who can't. You know what I'm saying? I mean, it's it to me,

564
00:54:00.88 --> 00:54:07.52
it's like walking, it's very primal, and a lot of people fail. Yeah, you put that rucksack on. It's

565
00:54:07.52 --> 00:54:14.24
nittyg. Not quite rocket anymore. Yes. Yeah, it sucks the life out of you for sure. What about the first

566
00:54:14.24 --> 00:54:19.60
I've always found like the first 17 minutes with a rock animal. I was like, oh yeah, I remember this

567
00:54:19.60 --> 00:54:24.88
shit. Yeah. Where your body starts to warm up and everything hurts and then you start moving.

568
00:54:25.20 --> 00:54:30.80
I've always been a good rocker that's always been my strength. And so I'd never had a hard time

569
00:54:30.80 --> 00:54:37.52
with rocking my feet. We're hard. My back was good. So I didn't have a difficult time with selection.

570
00:54:38.08 --> 00:54:44.40
But what I saw as a lot of guys weren't prepared for that level and duration of movement,

571
00:54:44.40 --> 00:54:48.40
and it just broke them down. What are you doing today? In those in that selection where you did

572
00:54:48.40 --> 00:54:56.56
what a week of rocking. What do you think you're doing today? On average, 16 to 10 kilometers per movement

573
00:54:56.56 --> 00:55:04.48
per gate. So it depends. You start that whole entire process. Here's the philosophy behind it.

574
00:55:05.28 --> 00:55:10.32
We're going to start moving you and get you on your feet. And then we'll give you an 18 mile or

575
00:55:10.32 --> 00:55:15.92
a 20. I think the average is a 20 something plus mile or so. So you're broke when you start.

576
00:55:15.92 --> 00:55:21.04
And then we'll move you for a long period of time and see it's all a test on preparation,

577
00:55:21.04 --> 00:55:27.28
by the way. It has nothing to do with the actual assessments. It has everything to measure whether or not

578
00:55:27.28 --> 00:55:33.68
you prepared in advance. And so what they want is the guys who've prepared in advance. And so at one point

579
00:55:34.32 --> 00:55:41.04
for the long range movement, which is 30, probably 30 plus miles over a period of 24, 48 hours,

580
00:55:41.04 --> 00:55:45.84
you're not stopped moving. And if you bed down for a period of time and you sit down each

581
00:55:45.84 --> 00:55:51.28
hour and rack out and you're not timing yourself appropriately, you just fail. And so you have to

582
00:55:51.28 --> 00:55:57.76
meet these gates, but it's all it's all on your own. And that jacks up people's minds. When somebody

583
00:55:57.76 --> 00:56:02.48
comes into a room and writes down exactly where you got to be, what uniform you got to be in,

584
00:56:02.48 --> 00:56:09.36
and what time you're moving. That independence and setting off with no destination to mind.

585
00:56:09.36 --> 00:56:13.04
Hey students, I want you to get ready, get your truck on. We're going to move until you

586
00:56:13.04 --> 00:56:18.16
tell you to stop. That immediately destroys people's mindset off the gate because they're like,

587
00:56:18.16 --> 00:56:22.08
what do you mean? So they go off the gate, they start spreading and they don't paste themselves

588
00:56:22.08 --> 00:56:27.92
and they burn themselves out. Or they're so insecure with the circumstance, they impose

589
00:56:27.92 --> 00:56:32.88
they self-induced all the stress and then they quit. And you're like, you're self-selecting because

590
00:56:32.88 --> 00:56:37.68
you don't have the exact parameters of what you're going to be doing. That's how war is.

591
00:56:37.68 --> 00:56:43.04
I mean war is, hey, we might be flexing all night. We might be flexing all year, who knows?

592
00:56:43.04 --> 00:56:48.64
And that uncertainty and a lot of people breaks people down. And they ring out or whatever,

593
00:56:48.64 --> 00:56:56.08
what do they do? How do you quit in the selection? So in selection, in periods of time,

594
00:56:56.08 --> 00:57:00.56
you go back to your barracks. And when I went to selection, it was a piece of plywood,

595
00:57:00.56 --> 00:57:06.16
no pillow, and you have a bunk that has no pad, nothing, nothing comfortable.

596
00:57:06.16 --> 00:57:11.92
You go to sleep in the morning and you wake up and half of your entire crew that you

597
00:57:11.92 --> 00:57:16.96
went to bed with is gone. And you're like, what? And so what people are doing is getting up,

598
00:57:16.96 --> 00:57:21.76
they're leaving, knocking on the hut and this self-select, like literally saying, I'm done.

599
00:57:21.76 --> 00:57:28.56
I'm out. You have to voluntarily withdraw and have a conversation in order to check on a selection.

600
00:57:29.20 --> 00:57:33.04
Yeah, there's something I've always found about being out in the field and Humping,

601
00:57:33.04 --> 00:57:39.04
specifically, there's two things that come to mind that I've been talking about this lately,

602
00:57:39.04 --> 00:57:45.84
from just like a leadership perspective and just at my own personal mindset is, I'm very aware

603
00:57:45.84 --> 00:57:51.52
of time. I'm very aware of time. I can always feel time creeping up on me. I can always feel time,

604
00:57:51.52 --> 00:57:57.68
like people think, oh, we'll be able to make it. We can we can rest a little longer. And I always

605
00:57:57.68 --> 00:58:01.68
had that sense that, oh, actually no, it's not, we're not going to make it. In fact, we need to

606
00:58:01.68 --> 00:58:05.36
leave now if we're going to make it or we're sitting there trying to come up with a plan. I said,

607
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:09.52
you know, we need to start moving forward. We can't spend any more time playing. It's time to go.

608
00:58:09.52 --> 00:58:14.88
I always had that sense of time and I still do. And it's almost a level of paranoia.

609
00:58:14.88 --> 00:58:20.56
It's something that always is in the front of my heads up display, right? My heads up display is

610
00:58:20.56 --> 00:58:24.24
always going, hey, wait, check your time, check your time, check your time. But that reminds me

611
00:58:24.88 --> 00:58:30.16
of being out on patrols, whether total dick drag or patrols, where you're carrying a shit

612
00:58:30.16 --> 00:58:35.52
ton of weight and you're going really far. And you still got to get to the target on time.

613
00:58:36.40 --> 00:58:45.28
And the, the, the intrinsic motivation that it takes. Because once you sit down, you take that

614
00:58:45.28 --> 00:58:51.36
load off and you see the guys all freaking sitting in a crappy perimeter and just they'll sit there,

615
00:58:51.36 --> 00:58:57.36
they'll sit there indefinitely. Like, like you take a platoon out and, and they've got,

616
00:58:57.36 --> 00:59:02.96
they're, they're, they're, they've, they've been crushed for a five, six, seven hour patrol.

617
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:11.04
They won't get up unless you're like, hey, boys, we gotta go. And if, if you don't do that,

618
00:59:11.04 --> 00:59:14.88
if somebody doesn't do that, somebody doesn't say, hey, guys, it's time to get up and go,

619
00:59:14.88 --> 00:59:18.96
there's no, there will be no movement. We'll, we'll happen. They'll, they'll not hit that target.

620
00:59:18.96 --> 00:59:22.48
They'll, okay, we couldn't make the target. That's what will happen. People accept that. Like,

621
00:59:22.48 --> 00:59:28.88
yeah, you know what? Yeah. And, and so having that, having that intrinsic will to say,

622
00:59:29.60 --> 00:59:34.32
look at your watching go, you know what? We, we said 10 minute break. It's been nine minutes.

623
00:59:34.32 --> 00:59:40.64
Hey, boys, get ready to roll. That's a big deal. Yes. That's a big deal. Yeah. I think part of the,

624
00:59:40.64 --> 00:59:44.40
you know, like you say discipline is freedom, part of that freedom is control that you have

625
00:59:44.40 --> 00:59:50.40
self-control. If you understand what you have to do to be discipline, to make gates, to meet

626
00:59:50.40 --> 00:59:55.44
time hacks, then you have control. You're offensive. You're thinking proactively. And a lot of

627
00:59:55.44 --> 01:00:00.72
guys don't have the discipline to do that. It's, it's, it's, it's real crazy to see that something

628
01:00:00.72 --> 01:00:09.12
so simple, a task, so common core can weed the masses and evaluate who's going to succeed

629
01:00:09.12 --> 01:00:14.64
with the combination of aptitude and discipline versus who's not. Yeah. And like you just said,

630
01:00:14.64 --> 01:00:20.32
what it really boils down to is when you're tired, when you're sore, and when you don't know

631
01:00:20.32 --> 01:00:25.52
how much longer this is going to last, do you have what it takes to put your rock back on,

632
01:00:25.52 --> 01:00:31.68
stand up and start walking again. It's it. Yeah. You wouldn't think it's something that

633
01:00:31.68 --> 01:00:38.48
that freaking simple, so simple, so primal too. So you get through selection. And then you hit the

634
01:00:38.48 --> 01:00:46.48
Q Course, hit the Q Course as a 18 Bravo, special forces weapon is guy going to third special

635
01:00:46.48 --> 01:00:54.56
forces group. Any, any highlights out of the Q Course? No, I think that you know, in the lead in

636
01:00:54.56 --> 01:01:00.32
talking about JFK and the representation of how we wanted to establish this irregular and unconventional

637
01:01:00.32 --> 01:01:05.84
means of warfare, I learned that truly from the long duration that I was in the Q Course.

638
01:01:07.28 --> 01:01:15.36
I went to Robin Sage, merely weeks after Robin Sage, after that experience, I was

639
01:01:15.36 --> 01:01:22.64
living that training in Afghanistan and remote firebase. So Robin Sage, which is an exercise,

640
01:01:22.64 --> 01:01:28.000
basically living unconventional warfare and an environment which is rocking him, North Carolina,

641
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.52
the surrounding area, where all the civilians or subcontractors and bought into this whole thing,

642
01:01:33.52 --> 01:01:39.76
it's elaborate scenario was so impactful for me. I mean, it's crazy. Yeah. So just to give a little

643
01:01:39.76 --> 01:01:46.72
background on the, so the mission of the Green Braids of Special Forces is to go out and work with

644
01:01:46.72 --> 01:01:53.76
indigenous forces, get them trained up, get them organized so that they can fight by themselves

645
01:01:53.76 --> 01:01:57.92
or with very little guidance from the, from the Special Forces, and eventually with no guidance at

646
01:01:57.92 --> 01:02:04.64
all. That's the, that's the mission. So the, you guys do this big exercise, it's sort of,

647
01:02:04.64 --> 01:02:08.80
is it like the final exercise that you do? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. And it's called Robin Sage and you

648
01:02:08.80 --> 01:02:14.24
go out and you have, quote, indigenous forces, which is really just the local populist inside this

649
01:02:14.24 --> 01:02:19.68
town and you have to train them and you have to work with them and you have to get information

650
01:02:19.68 --> 01:02:26.40
from them and set up targets and the whole nine yards because that's what the primary mission

651
01:02:26.40 --> 01:02:31.12
of Special Forces is to go do that. Yeah. It's by with through its foreign internal defense.

652
01:02:31.84 --> 01:02:36.000
It's been newly coined counterterrorism, foreign internal defense based on the words that we're in

653
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.72
now. But it's the idea of, you have to build relationships and rapport with indigenous people,

654
01:02:42.72 --> 01:02:50.000
with forces. You just can't go and do deliberate actions only. You know, SR, DA, HR, those things

655
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.36
are complementary to a strategic plan. The strategy is we have to win the hearts and minds. So

656
01:02:55.36 --> 01:03:00.72
when I went to Robin Sage, you had West Pointers, like junior West Pointers. We had

657
01:03:00.72 --> 01:03:06.56
role players from the military that are interweaved in this scenario where you can't just go into

658
01:03:06.56 --> 01:03:12.16
this circumstance and treat them with a military mind. You have to break bread with them. You

659
01:03:12.16 --> 01:03:16.88
have the drink tea with them. You have to learn about their family and build this relationship

660
01:03:16.88 --> 01:03:22.000
because you have to trust these guys on target. And so that's what I really took away from Robin

661
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.28
Sage was this opportunity to learn and grow and culture and then build that relationship, which

662
01:03:29.28 --> 01:03:35.28
meant we're building a bond where we could fight side by side and the width portion of it

663
01:03:35.28 --> 01:03:41.20
and find it fixed and finish these bad guys together in powering the host nation that we're

664
01:03:41.20 --> 01:03:48.16
doing warfare with. That's super important because the translation of going into war

665
01:03:48.72 --> 01:03:53.92
was exactly that with the circumstance with Afghanistan at the time. And you know, like I

666
01:03:53.92 --> 01:03:59.44
wanted this scenario as I built conduit and a chicken coop and a chicken house for six hours with

667
01:03:59.44 --> 01:04:03.52
this guy and I'm like, I'm like, look at the other dude, I'm with him. Dude, what's going on?

668
01:04:03.52 --> 01:04:08.16
Like, what are we doing right now? Are we just, are we actually just doing a tasking and just

669
01:04:08.16 --> 01:04:12.80
hoping this dude up because it's we got to pass it to this and then at the end of that six hours

670
01:04:12.80 --> 01:04:17.36
we heard a noise and I'm like, it's all coming together. We put our info, we ran into the woods,

671
01:04:17.36 --> 01:04:21.84
put our in force together out of her backpack and ambush these two dudes who were interrogating

672
01:04:21.84 --> 01:04:27.52
and bullying this farmer and I'm like, this is so awesome. I mean, it's still long, it's a long

673
01:04:27.52 --> 01:04:32.40
burn but it was so awesome as an experience. And then you, so you get done with anything out

674
01:04:32.40 --> 01:04:37.36
in the Q-course stands out. Not survival school. I mean, survival school got my ass handed to me.

675
01:04:37.36 --> 01:04:44.08
I mean, it's the first time that I, I mean, how long is the survival school? It's pretty long.

676
01:04:44.08 --> 01:04:48.88
I mean, it's probably a few weeks when I went through it was like a escape, like a survival

677
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:54.96
block. Yeah, it's a, a CRC, the high-ressee, a sea version, what you guys have gone through. And then,

678
01:04:55.52 --> 01:05:00.64
you know, you escape, you evade and then you go into the RTO and just get your ass handed to you.

679
01:05:00.64 --> 01:05:09.12
And, and again, you learn very rapidly that we're not all created equal in our capacity to deal with stress.

680
01:05:09.76 --> 01:05:15.44
And I, I don't find with it. I mean, I grew up fighting, I grew up in martial arts. I grew up doing

681
01:05:15.44 --> 01:05:20.000
all these things, which set me up for success there to go, hey, man, this is an exercise.

682
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.76
Learn from this experience. Wait, what martial arts did you grow up in? Ninjitsu

683
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:30.32
before straight up Ninjitsu, who wants something? Dude, I, my first instructors were all green

684
01:05:30.32 --> 01:05:35.84
brazen for Brad North Carolina, who opened a Ninjitsu school active and former SF guys.

685
01:05:36.56 --> 01:05:40.56
And it was gangster. We were doing stuff like my mom once.

686
01:05:40.56 --> 01:05:45.76
I, I, I did do have them shoes with the toe cut out, yeah. Look at you, you're like how

687
01:05:45.76 --> 01:05:49.04
you're like sure kidding. So how do all the free thoughts? The toners, yeah, you were just

688
01:05:49.04 --> 01:05:52.88
getting it. It was crazy. I was wondering who is buying all that stuff out of the back of freaking

689
01:05:52.88 --> 01:05:58.48
know, black belt magazine. I had a lot, it was, it was, I had all the red knives all that it was

690
01:05:58.48 --> 01:06:05.52
crazy. It, it was, it was a cool experience because my guys that were the instructors were all green

691
01:06:05.52 --> 01:06:10.72
and burrace. And so they like you do like a lot of guys with our experiences do,

692
01:06:11.36 --> 01:06:16.56
try to impart those experiences and impact on young people. And so they were doing the same with me.

693
01:06:16.56 --> 01:06:20.40
So I felt like I was mentored by these green burrace. Once I wanted to do a class

694
01:06:21.28 --> 01:06:26.08
and my mom dropped me off and for my mom to be paying for this courses a big deal.

695
01:06:26.72 --> 01:06:30.56
She dropped me off and she saw the instructor put me in front of a mirror.

696
01:06:30.56 --> 01:06:36.000
She came back an hour and ten minutes later and I was still standing in front of the mirror.

697
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.60
And she was pissed off because she's like, I'm paying for my son. Why are you doing? Why are you only

698
01:06:41.60 --> 01:06:46.16
having a stand there? It's an assessment. And I stared at myself for an hour and meditation.

699
01:06:46.16 --> 01:06:51.76
I'm like, what the hell? I learned a lot about myself in that hour. It's crazy.

700
01:06:52.80 --> 01:06:58.72
Alright so back to back to, did you stay away before we go there? Did you guys fight each other in

701
01:06:58.72 --> 01:07:04.24
Ninja 2 school? A lot. It was aggressive. A lot of dudes got hurt. I think it was a lot.

702
01:07:05.36 --> 01:07:06.80
Before, what year was this?

703
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:09.92
93, 94.

704
01:07:09.92 --> 01:07:11.12
I don't see you have a lot of stuff.

705
01:07:11.12 --> 01:07:16.56
Yeah, that's coming out. Yeah. People were, this is during the revolution. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It was a lot of,

706
01:07:16.56 --> 01:07:21.60
I mean there were, I mean Ninja 2 has, and this Japanese form has a lot of traditional

707
01:07:21.60 --> 01:07:29.60
uh, jujitsu type moves on the ground, but it's not ground game. So you are move, yes. It's a singular

708
01:07:29.60 --> 01:07:34.40
move. It's a singular. That's the problem. That is the problem. That's a inherent problem with that.

709
01:07:34.40 --> 01:07:39.60
And so I, I learned a lot about discipline from that experience, but it made me harder.

710
01:07:39.60 --> 01:07:44.40
So when I went to survival school, I was just prepped, man. I was good. I, and it wasn't a

711
01:07:44.40 --> 01:07:49.36
difficult thing, but I saw dudes fall apart. And when I went to survival school, it was the last

712
01:07:49.36 --> 01:07:56.000
thing that you did in the Q course. If you failed, you failed everything. You just, you just spent

713
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.80
two years of your life training to be a greenbrae, and they let dudes go, how many people fail?

714
01:08:00.80 --> 01:08:05.76
Half. We'd have a couple per class. I mean, it was common. We have a couple per class. That would

715
01:08:05.76 --> 01:08:09.44
self select, and they were like, I'm done. You're like, you just a teacher. We're just making them

716
01:08:09.44 --> 01:08:14.72
quit. The stress, man. Well, it's stressful. Well, I mean, getting like, even just a hood,

717
01:08:14.72 --> 01:08:18.32
like people aren't used to taking, if you, if you, if you don't grow up in those martial arts,

718
01:08:18.32 --> 01:08:23.20
if you don't grow up in impact sports, and that used to make in contact. When that hood comes

719
01:08:23.20 --> 01:08:29.36
off your head, and you get slapped by dudes, hands who are like pickle fingers, and he slap

720
01:08:29.36 --> 01:08:36.32
your face, and you can't do anything, that starts breaking you down. And by, you know, day two of

721
01:08:36.32 --> 01:08:41.76
that experience, you know, laying naked in your cell, flux cuff, and a box, you, you, you, a lot

722
01:08:41.76 --> 01:08:49.12
of guys sell select. I thought it was, I was into claustrophobia. I like being a small place. I,

723
01:08:49.12 --> 01:08:52.40
I hid, I slept, and I was like, this is awesome. Just keep me in this box.

724
01:08:53.28 --> 01:08:58.40
Man, I got slapped so hard when I got captured at Sierra School. The, it surprised me.

725
01:08:58.40 --> 01:09:05.68
Yeah. Like, it was, I mean, this guy freaking out and nowhere. The hood comes off. I'm standing

726
01:09:05.68 --> 01:09:08.96
up against the wall. It's out in the middle of the woods, and they have like a wall. And I

727
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:12.80
think it's almost like a Hollywood wall where it, when you get pushed into it, it kind of

728
01:09:12.80 --> 01:09:17.04
gives a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. So he pushed me into it once, and like whatever, I must

729
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:22.88
add some kind of punk ass freaking smirk on my face like whatever. And this dude did not like it at

730
01:09:22.88 --> 01:09:29.52
all. E-core, cracked me. I mean, I'm talking as hard as a human being, and I mean, I've been punching

731
01:09:29.52 --> 01:09:34.40
the face. It was like that, but he hasn't happened to be open. And I, I, I just got the little,

732
01:09:34.40 --> 01:09:39.92
got the little flash, and I was like, oh, Dave. This is real. I was like, yeah. And believe me,

733
01:09:39.92 --> 01:09:47.36
that was that was number one because he followed that one up. Yeah. But I, like you, I can't

734
01:09:47.36 --> 01:09:52.96
imagine that that would have made me quit. But I guess there's someone's not used to, you know,

735
01:09:52.96 --> 01:09:57.76
maybe scrapping or whatnot. That's it. Yeah. A lot of people quit. Not really for them. Yeah. I had

736
01:09:57.76 --> 01:10:03.36
what, the interesting thing in this psychology was, you're playing, you have to be resistant. Right?

737
01:10:03.36 --> 01:10:10.56
The whole game is your resistant. I remember we were building in the sand, a sickle that represented

738
01:10:10.56 --> 01:10:18.000
the communist, you know, scenario. And we were building the sickle and have of us were sabotaging

739
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
the sickle. So guys would make it. And I remember I had a guy who I highly respected he was

740
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.76
but tuned started the infantry, had gone through training with me. I was scooting all the stuff out

741
01:10:27.76 --> 01:10:32.64
after they were building it, knocking it over. And he turned around and he walked to me because

742
01:10:32.64 --> 01:10:38.40
why are you doing? I'm like, what do you mean what are you doing? Dude, I like worked an hour on that.

743
01:10:38.40 --> 01:10:44.24
I'm like, wait a minute, you realize that we're supposed to be subverting this whole circumstance.

744
01:10:44.24 --> 01:10:50.80
Like you're not supposed to actually be making this. And he's like, oh, and he was in the scenario,

745
01:10:50.80 --> 01:10:54.88
man, freaking bridge on the river. Quiet. Oh, dude, it was insane. Right. Some of these guys were like,

746
01:10:54.88 --> 01:11:00.24
the headlights. I mean, they had the deer and the headlights look and they thought for real,

747
01:11:00.24 --> 01:11:05.92
they were in the back country of Vietnam. I mean, it was it was crazy. It was crazy to see.

748
01:11:05.92 --> 01:11:12.32
It was cool. Cool experience. Yeah, get, get, get, go ahead. What kind of claustrophobia stuff did

749
01:11:12.32 --> 01:11:18.48
they? A lot of it was, this this guy right here is kind of claustrophobic. Yeah, we've been working with them.

750
01:11:18.48 --> 01:11:24.16
Yeah, yeah, exposure is the way to deal with that. But it's they had, I mean, it was it was very

751
01:11:24.16 --> 01:11:30.72
tight, secluded spaces where you couldn't sit down on your butt and you couldn't stand up all the

752
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:35.60
way. So you're in a uncomfortable stress position and then they would close the box on you and turn

753
01:11:35.60 --> 01:11:41.60
up lights and then they play the music like crying babies, all kinds of different stuff. And

754
01:11:41.60 --> 01:11:47.20
a lot of people, they would transfer you in a different box is based on your fear. So if they saw

755
01:11:47.20 --> 01:11:50.96
the fear coming out of you, they were exploiting that fear. They're like, oh, this dude in a big

756
01:11:50.96 --> 01:11:57.68
box is getting scary. Let's put him in a small box. And so it varied from small boxes to big boxes.

757
01:11:58.96 --> 01:12:03.68
But that jacked up a lot of people. I mean, it was it was significant. And then how long

758
01:12:03.68 --> 01:12:09.84
do you have to stand there? So a long time. You lose track of time because you're sleep deprived.

759
01:12:09.84 --> 01:12:17.52
Here's one story. I, I thinking I was a smart guy. I, I was like similar to the, I have to piss

760
01:12:17.52 --> 01:12:23.44
right now, but I had a piss really bad. And so I'm like, if I piss in this box, they're going to hook

761
01:12:23.44 --> 01:12:29.76
me up. I can't piss in this box. So this is my, I'm thinking logically, I think. And I'm like,

762
01:12:29.76 --> 01:12:34.24
this is completely logical. We, so hook me up is a bad thing. Hook like, like, pull me out of the

763
01:12:34.24 --> 01:12:40.96
thing and slap you. And slap my face off my face. And I'm like, look, I'll piss in my boot.

764
01:12:41.68 --> 01:12:45.20
And then I'll take it outside and we're in the gravel. I'll dump the piss off.

765
01:12:45.20 --> 01:12:50.96
Forgetting about this whole thing called displacement, right? I pee in my boot. I take off my

766
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:56.88
boot. You don't have socks. Your naked get these bare pajamas on. I fill my boot with piss.

767
01:12:57.60 --> 01:13:02.40
And then I'm like, okay, I got it in here. I feel good. It's not all of a thing. And then I put my

768
01:13:02.40 --> 01:13:07.44
foot back in the boot. Damn. And then it goes everywhere. And I'm like, and then immediately occurs to me,

769
01:13:07.44 --> 01:13:14.56
like, that was a horrible idea. It's, I'm standing in piss. And then my foot, my naked foot is covered in piss.

770
01:13:14.56 --> 01:13:19.36
And I'm like, dude, that did not work out. I had a plan. That was not how I thought I was going to

771
01:13:19.36 --> 01:13:24.000
execute. It was a horrible man. It's funny because as you've thinking about that, I was

772
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.56
you were talking about that. And then when you asked that question echo, you know, there's some,

773
01:13:28.56 --> 01:13:34.64
look, I don't know if this is some, you know, just straight up, Sam Harris meditation type

774
01:13:34.64 --> 01:13:40.48
scenario. But you get your brain where you just aren't there anymore. You're just like,

775
01:13:40.48 --> 01:13:43.52
cool, you're putting the box cool. Then you're sitting there and you're thinking about

776
01:13:43.52 --> 01:13:50.32
freaking whatever Kentucky fried chicken and lemonade. And you're just in a totally different world.

777
01:13:50.32 --> 01:13:56.80
And you don't know if it's been an hour or five hours. And you're getting slapped. It's like,

778
01:13:56.80 --> 01:14:01.52
cool, whatever. Like, whatever they're going to do to you. You just sort of, and it's the same thing

779
01:14:01.52 --> 01:14:06.08
when we were talking about, homo and rock, it's like, okay, look, there's just, I'm not, the pain is there,

780
01:14:06.08 --> 01:14:09.68
but it's like somewhere else. It's like, it's almost like you're watching it happen and you kind of

781
01:14:09.68 --> 01:14:15.52
can be like, yeah, whatever. Hey, keep going. Yeah, completely, your, your, your sedated man.

782
01:14:15.52 --> 01:14:20.56
You're just going with the flow. It's, it's similarly to, I think about when you accept at some

783
01:14:20.56 --> 01:14:25.28
point when you're in water that you're just going to pass out and you accept that. You're like,

784
01:14:25.28 --> 01:14:31.68
I'm okay with that. That bridge in that gap and just accepting it is the, the first part

785
01:14:31.68 --> 01:14:36.48
and being successful in that environment. And then you, like, you create your new happy place

786
01:14:36.48 --> 01:14:41.28
where you're like, man, it's long as I'm in my head and I have this space that I'm comfortable with.

787
01:14:41.28 --> 01:14:45.84
I'm good. You could do whatever you want. You're nothing you do to do. Yeah, if you are present

788
01:14:46.16 --> 01:14:51.12
in the shit that you're going through, yeah, that's got a suck. I can't even, I can barely even

789
01:14:51.12 --> 01:14:56.08
relate to it because I, I think, eventually you just get good at being like, okay, I call whatever,

790
01:14:56.08 --> 01:15:00.24
that's what we're doing, cool, whatever. I can't, it's got a, that's what, that's, you know,

791
01:15:00.24 --> 01:15:04.96
that when I start thinking about what makes someone quit, it's because they're present in that

792
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:09.92
shit that's going down. They're actually in it. Yeah. And now they in it, they're looking at the

793
01:15:09.92 --> 01:15:14.56
future going. It's just more shit in the future. So, oh, this is horrible and forget it. I'm going

794
01:15:14.56 --> 01:15:19.76
to ring out. Yeah. It's that fair response. It's the comped inflation of impending doom. You're

795
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:24.40
just thinking about the next thing that's coming and then your whole life is all these little

796
01:15:24.40 --> 01:15:30.24
small progressives of like, doomsday, doomsday. It's like, dude, I'm, I'm on the beach,

797
01:15:30.24 --> 01:15:36.16
drinking a painting colata, eating a piece of chicken right now. I'm, I'm, I'm living my best life in my head.

798
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:41.52
And I'm good. You must have learned some of that. The tomb situation because that stuff

799
01:15:41.52 --> 01:15:46.16
doesn't sound fun to me. I would rather go through serious school 20 times right now than, yes,

800
01:15:46.16 --> 01:15:51.28
you uniform inspections. I would rather do that as well. I would take, that the tomb taught me

801
01:15:51.28 --> 01:16:00.72
about self awareness and being present within my own mind and developing this relationship with

802
01:16:00.72 --> 01:16:06.32
the conscious voice that's in my head, but also like this passive observer, this person who's

803
01:16:06.32 --> 01:16:12.24
kind of observing the narration of the voice in my head and sitting back and like measuring all

804
01:16:12.24 --> 01:16:19.76
these inputs. Because when you're standing still for 21 seconds at a time before you take 21 steps,

805
01:16:19.76 --> 01:16:26.08
repeating it times an hour for a long walk during the winter hours, times four to six walks a

806
01:16:26.08 --> 01:16:31.60
day. You have to get real good at being comfortable with yourself. Is there a face improvement in

807
01:16:31.60 --> 01:16:38.80
there? There is. So it's a face washing in DC 21 seconds, face down the mat 21 seconds, walk 21

808
01:16:38.80 --> 01:16:45.68
steps and repeat for the entire duration. And it's one hour. One hour and seven minutes with the walk

809
01:16:45.68 --> 01:16:50.56
in the garage change. How often would you be in total autopilot where you'd get done and be like,

810
01:16:50.56 --> 01:17:00.40
well, that was constantly. You know, that's referred to as the flow state. You're completely

811
01:17:00.40 --> 01:17:06.96
in a flow state. Because when I like about, you were talking about time. Time has always been

812
01:17:06.96 --> 01:17:12.000
important metric. In fact, we should probably get a more closely because that relationship with

813
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.36
time, I think sets and establishes these gates and disciplines for your whole life,

814
01:17:17.36 --> 01:17:22.48
for the structure of your life, right? When I was a team guard, one thing that you had to

815
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:28.32
train to do is count 21 seconds exactly and then turn into face for 21 seconds and get this

816
01:17:28.32 --> 01:17:35.36
rhythm and cadence down. But when you got into that flow state, it was unconscious. So now I'm just

817
01:17:35.36 --> 01:17:42.88
on autopilot and I'm in a meditative state. There's times that I came off the mat after an hour walk

818
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:49.52
and feeling like the best I've ever felt, like super calm, super relaxed, super focused and like I

819
01:17:49.52 --> 01:17:55.60
was doing meditation in my own headspace. That translated throughout all of the uncomfortable,

820
01:17:55.60 --> 01:18:01.20
even experiences and gun fights and everything else I did in my life, created a structure in my

821
01:18:01.20 --> 01:18:07.28
head for being comfortable in my own head in physical stress in my environment.

822
01:18:09.20 --> 01:18:13.68
Sometimes when I do due to jutsu, I don't really know what happened for the last hour.

823
01:18:13.68 --> 01:18:18.24
Yeah, like I'm just like, what, how did you get that? I'm like, I don't remember getting anything.

824
01:18:18.24 --> 01:18:24.64
Yeah, and I remember early on in my in my seal career, like entering a room and shooting

825
01:18:24.64 --> 01:18:27.92
some targets and then and then all of a sudden be like, wait a second, my weapon, my weapon,

826
01:18:27.92 --> 01:18:31.20
I don't take it, I don't want to say it and not want to draw any attention to myself because I don't

827
01:18:31.20 --> 01:18:34.96
want to see that I don't want my weapon, weapon is unsafe. Yeah, I did it without and then

828
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:38.96
you know, did it absolutely without thinking about it. That was pretty early, you know, and eventually

829
01:18:38.96 --> 01:18:43.76
you're just like doing this like a freaking robot, that's just execute. Yeah, that high level,

830
01:18:43.76 --> 01:18:49.36
I mean it's theta and alpha and these these wavelengths of like this neurological consciousness

831
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
when you're in that alpha state and you're taking that that information similar to like,

832
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.64
when you're in a shower or on a drive and all these thoughts come to you, this creativity

833
01:18:58.64 --> 01:19:04.48
comes to you. Those things happen in that flow state because you're streaming information and

834
01:19:04.48 --> 01:19:09.76
that's when you're most I think when you're at your best, right? It's when you're falling

835
01:19:09.76 --> 01:19:14.32
in CQB and everything comes together and you're like, what just happened? Like we were just

836
01:19:14.32 --> 01:19:19.52
objective secure in 17 seconds. How did that happen? I barely remember anything but I was so

837
01:19:19.52 --> 01:19:24.40
conscious because you run that alpha state of flow. It's an amazing state to be and

838
01:19:24.40 --> 01:19:28.24
and I think very rare for people to find these days with the distractions they have.

839
01:19:31.36 --> 01:19:35.20
You wrap up the QCourse. The last thing you do is rob and say to work and with, you know,

840
01:19:35.20 --> 01:19:40.48
role playing in-ditch and then you said you're almost immediately in Afghanistan.

841
01:19:41.52 --> 01:19:47.04
Right out the gate deployed with thirds, special forces could put a mountain team and then

842
01:19:47.04 --> 01:19:51.76
do nine months in Afghanistan or a mot fire base just right off the gate, right off the gate,

843
01:19:52.32 --> 01:19:55.12
during operation redwing. My company was involved in redwings.

844
01:19:57.68 --> 01:20:02.80
When I got to a team, it was the traditional green parade mission. We're going to put you in a

845
01:20:02.80 --> 01:20:09.52
mot fire base on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan as an 18-brobbo at 150 Afghan soldiers that

846
01:20:09.52 --> 01:20:15.04
weren't even soldiers. This is before Afghan National Army was even stood up and solidified,

847
01:20:15.04 --> 01:20:22.64
especially in our region of a nervous-stand province. And we trained assisted in advise these guys

848
01:20:23.20 --> 01:20:27.52
made them Afghan special forces guys and started conducting operations in a nervous-stand.

849
01:20:29.12 --> 01:20:34.40
What kind of operations were you conducting? Movement to contact. We did SR,

850
01:20:34.40 --> 01:20:44.000
Special Reconnaissance. We did DA a lot of training and a lot of getting attacked. I mean,

851
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.40
we got attacked every other day in the remote location that we're in. We're the furthest

852
01:20:51.36 --> 01:20:57.68
northern fire base beyond J-bad, beyond Assadabad, in a fire base called Narei,

853
01:20:57.68 --> 01:21:03.76
right on the border, surrounded by the Hindu Kush. I mean, we were at the bottom of that bowl.

854
01:21:04.32 --> 01:21:08.80
So rockets and directed tax almost every other day. And so we did a lot of

855
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.84
reactive contact, immediate action drills. And a lot of patrols. I mean, we drove up and down

856
01:21:16.32 --> 01:21:22.96
one MSR. I went down went to Paira-Calt and eventually ended up in Shetraw, Pakistan,

857
01:21:22.96 --> 01:21:27.84
and conducted a whole bunch of air ops and ground ops in that area.

858
01:21:29.84 --> 01:21:36.64
Was this like a traditional ODI team of 10 or 12 guys? 12 guys with a small contingent of

859
01:21:37.36 --> 01:21:44.40
civil affairs for a period of time, one combat controller, and a fire base, two hours from air and

860
01:21:44.40 --> 01:21:51.04
J-bad. So as remote as you can get, I mean, we were self-sustained. I learned a lot, even fast

861
01:21:51.04 --> 01:21:58.56
fording it with how I teach survival and sustaining oneself. And what we call just homestead as we teach it

862
01:21:59.20 --> 01:22:02.48
about how you have to take care of yourself because you don't have the opportunity.

863
01:22:03.28 --> 01:22:08.16
And those remote circumstances did a pen on any kind of assets. I mean, a snowstorm in that area

864
01:22:08.16 --> 01:22:14.24
would shut us down for a week at a time where we get no air support. No air support, no cast,

865
01:22:14.24 --> 01:22:22.000
no resupply, no meta-vac platforms. So we were solely dependent on the men and their skill sets

866
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:30.56
that they have based on their experiences. That's freaking sketchy. It was the Wild West.

867
01:22:30.56 --> 01:22:35.60
The greatest time I had in SF to be honest. We didn't have a flagpole. We had

868
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:43.92
Cyple-5 W's for a con-up submissions. It was a good time. And did you realize that while you were doing it?

869
01:22:44.48 --> 01:22:50.72
I did. I had the introspect. I mean, when I remember when I showed up and we landed at $10,000

870
01:22:50.72 --> 01:22:56.32
plus feet of elevation. And I was pissed in mellow yellow. I mean, I was like, do this is insane.

871
01:22:56.32 --> 01:23:00.40
And I remember standing in the middle of my fire base. We were long, comb-n-r river.

872
01:23:00.40 --> 01:23:06.88
Very small base. I mean, I could throw a football and hit every gate. I've ever

873
01:23:06.88 --> 01:23:10.96
been looking around going, well, this is my home for almost a year. Get comfortable with this,

874
01:23:10.96 --> 01:23:16.80
because this is how it's going to be. And immediately, transforming and using those cultural

875
01:23:16.80 --> 01:23:22.08
tactics and building relationships, but getting comfortable with time. Because I didn't know

876
01:23:22.08 --> 01:23:26.32
when we were going to get out. I didn't know if we were going to survive. We've lost a lot of

877
01:23:26.32 --> 01:23:31.04
guys. That rotation, operation, redwing, and a happen. So there's a whole bunch of circumstances

878
01:23:31.04 --> 01:23:35.76
that happen during that trip where I'm like, do this might be it? I mean, this is pretty hot,

879
01:23:35.76 --> 01:23:40.48
circumstance. Are you going to get out of this? Stop thinking about that. It's like the character

880
01:23:40.48 --> 01:23:45.60
in Banner Brothers, the officer who said, you know, who's basically walking dead, just accept

881
01:23:45.60 --> 01:23:50.000
the fact that you're going to be killed. I had those kind of moments going. This is it, man. We're

882
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.60
focused on the mission. And it changed a lot of how I, what I assumed at war in practice and how

883
01:23:57.60 --> 01:24:03.28
it executed in real life. A lot of it was steering concepts and didn't necessarily translate.

884
01:24:03.28 --> 01:24:11.92
What was the delta between the two? The biggest thing was my relationship in the ODA was teaching

885
01:24:11.92 --> 01:24:17.92
tactics and creating a base defense plan. And so the doctrine told me to do specific things that

886
01:24:17.92 --> 01:24:22.72
didn't work in our environment. So you had a base defense plan for example, where I would exercise

887
01:24:22.72 --> 01:24:27.12
my guys and say, hey, I want you to hit the walls, hit the roof, be prepared for that directed tack.

888
01:24:27.84 --> 01:24:31.76
Well, that's the dumbest tactic when you're receiving one of seven millimeter rockets that

889
01:24:31.76 --> 01:24:36.56
have a kill radius of a hundred yards. And so you put dudes on the roof, which I did myself on the

890
01:24:36.56 --> 01:24:42.64
first directed tack, got on the roof with a 240 machine gun. And I'm like, do what am I? And I'm

891
01:24:42.64 --> 01:24:48.24
getting, and we's a 107 screamed over me, my 18 Charlie, my engineer, and impact it a fuel

892
01:24:48.24 --> 01:24:56.24
blivit behind us and exploded. And I'm like, what am I doing? And also in practice, you could

893
01:24:56.24 --> 01:25:02.16
immediate action to death, what it's like to react to contact with small arms. But how do you react

894
01:25:02.16 --> 01:25:08.32
to contact when it's a 107 millimeter rocket? When it's an 81 millimeter motor, all of the things

895
01:25:08.32 --> 01:25:15.28
that you prepare for change rapidly, when that kind of ordinance and munitions and firepower

896
01:25:15.28 --> 01:25:20.32
come to bear completely changes everything. So I'm like, oh, this isn't like run it through

897
01:25:20.32 --> 01:25:25.36
wood line and Fort Bragg North Carolina. This is a little bit different. And so that change my

898
01:25:25.36 --> 01:25:31.68
perspective on a doctrinal conventional answer and solution versus being creative and coming

899
01:25:31.68 --> 01:25:39.12
up with new ways and tactics as you evolve at the speed of war. Did you guys have any counter

900
01:25:39.12 --> 01:25:44.48
battery or anything like that? None. I had, did you have mortars? I had 120 millimeter mortars.

901
01:25:45.28 --> 01:25:49.44
I mean, nightly that I would go out and we'd be dropping on point of origin sites on

902
01:25:49.44 --> 01:25:56.32
poo sites. But that's all we had. The biggest weapon systems we had were munitions and

903
01:25:56.32 --> 01:26:02.000
cashiers that we found and cashers that we found where we took them and turned them around on

904
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.52
bad guys. We put a Mark 21, 107 millimeter pod. We get one rocket from the bad guy. The

905
01:26:07.52 --> 01:26:14.80
sit rep would read, you know, ODA366 response with 57, 107 millimeter rockets. 106 millimeter

906
01:26:14.80 --> 01:26:20.88
recorulus rifles. We had mounted the ATVs. We had RPGs that we carried with us in backpacks

907
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:28.32
and we were using Chinese made 120s to respond and react to contact. So it was truly a, I think,

908
01:26:29.36 --> 01:26:38.56
significant green beret fire base mission. You ever seen the movie heat before? Yeah,

909
01:26:38.56 --> 01:26:43.28
yeah. This makes me think about this is the second time I thought about it in recent times, but

910
01:26:43.28 --> 01:26:53.20
you know, like the cop is telling, the cop is saying, hey, you can make mistakes. Or no,

911
01:26:53.20 --> 01:26:56.40
I can make mistakes. Doesn't matter if I catch you or not. Like I'm going to go home at night.

912
01:26:56.40 --> 01:27:01.76
Yeah. You make one mistake and it's game over. Yeah. And that's what I think of, you know,

913
01:27:01.76 --> 01:27:06.64
the enemy in that situation, they don't have to take very big risks at all. They can

914
01:27:06.64 --> 01:27:11.60
lob shit at you from wherever and they just have to get lucky one time. That's it to get a guy.

915
01:27:11.60 --> 01:27:18.48
Yeah. And you've got to be vigilant all the time and you've got to keep your guard up all the time.

916
01:27:18.48 --> 01:27:21.60
And even if you keep your guard up all the time, you're still just exposed just by the nature

917
01:27:21.60 --> 01:27:25.84
of the fact that you're in a valley surrounded by indirect fire or direct fire in terms of rockets.

918
01:27:25.84 --> 01:27:34.64
Yeah. Yeah. Our strategy in that fire base was a test bed for creativity.

919
01:27:34.64 --> 01:27:41.92
Um, we built a mosque like I physically built a mosque with my hands. My ODA brick by brick helped

920
01:27:41.92 --> 01:27:48.000
build a mosque. Why? Because we wanted to build rapport with having a place of

921
01:27:49.20 --> 01:27:54.72
worship inside of our fire base for Afghans, but it also deterred indirect fire. Because no

922
01:27:54.72 --> 01:27:58.40
terrorists weren't be responsible for dropping a mosque in the middle of an American fire base.

923
01:27:58.40 --> 01:28:06.56
Like we had to think outside the box. And we truly were set up almost for failure in that circumstance.

924
01:28:06.96 --> 01:28:14.24
But every fire base had a hold its territory. Before VSO, we're village stabilization operations

925
01:28:14.24 --> 01:28:19.36
where you're setting up in the actual village, the idea of fire bases derived from obviously

926
01:28:19.36 --> 01:28:24.48
from Vietnam era, from John Shreck and Mire air of, hey, let's go out, set out these bases

927
01:28:24.48 --> 01:28:29.68
and establish a presence. And so we were present and the bad guys knew about it. And it was a

928
01:28:30.40 --> 01:28:34.000
sharp learning curve steep learning curve, instead of least. Where you get the food from?

929
01:28:35.04 --> 01:28:41.84
Typically, initially we were flying in and until we started getting creative, we built a

930
01:28:42.48 --> 01:28:47.60
breadhouse where we were making foot bread, Afghan foot bread in the middle of our fire base.

931
01:28:47.60 --> 01:28:52.96
Then we started procuring goats and sheep and then slaughtering them and then eating them and

932
01:28:52.96 --> 01:28:58.000
then rice and we were getting supplies from Pakistan because it was around across the border

933
01:28:58.56 --> 01:29:04.000
and bringing it in to make actually good mills versus the Murmai child that we're getting. That was

934
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.52
garbage too. It was disgusting. Did you, did you take any casualties from all those attacks?

935
01:29:11.52 --> 01:29:18.88
Yeah, I mean we had, we had wounded in actual, I killed an action or a company. We, during the mid range,

936
01:29:18.88 --> 01:29:25.68
we just had the anniversary of Operation Red Wings, which was the 28th of June.

937
01:29:27.12 --> 01:29:33.12
We got hit up for that mission task with that. Can't advance, which was in Bagram,

938
01:29:33.92 --> 01:29:38.96
kind of assembled the quick reaction force that eventually went out and lost one of the birds

939
01:29:38.96 --> 01:29:46.000
on the MH-47 that were shot down. So we did QRF for that. Did some big operations and

940
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.12
what coat you've all in your barricade and took casualties. We lost the MH-47 during that trip.

941
01:29:53.76 --> 01:29:59.68
Pretty expensive bird. It was overall a good trip. Our fire bases were successful and

942
01:29:59.68 --> 01:30:08.48
disrupting the enemy, but we just started over, man. The detriment to warfare is this vicious cycle.

943
01:30:08.48 --> 01:30:13.44
And when you take a playbook and you plan the playbook, but you don't put in the same

944
01:30:13.44 --> 01:30:19.84
continuity pieces to establish a long-term relationship, you just start the vicious cycle over again.

945
01:30:19.84 --> 01:30:27.68
Every detachment commander, every team sergeant, once their mark in history on that battleground,

946
01:30:28.08 --> 01:30:34.72
and it doesn't do well long-term in warfare, which is obviously where the point we're at today.

947
01:30:34.72 --> 01:30:40.08
I mean pulling on an abafghanistan. Would you do during redway? Were you on the recovery

948
01:30:40.08 --> 01:30:48.08
of the war? So two of my companies in a side of ad in J. Bad, south of us got tasked to actually do

949
01:30:48.08 --> 01:30:54.80
the rescue of Marcus Attro. So, good buddy of my Kent was the ground force commander for that.

950
01:30:54.80 --> 01:30:59.92
Two ODAs and the arrangers went in with some intermittent special operations guys.

951
01:31:00.40 --> 01:31:06.80
We got told because of our proximity to the actual site crash site to hold fast, they sent

952
01:31:06.80 --> 01:31:11.92
schnooks to us to be the QRF for the other group and then the rest of our company, all the other

953
01:31:11.92 --> 01:31:17.52
ODAs did the battery recovery with batayan. So there was a the whole company was involved and

954
01:31:17.52 --> 01:31:21.12
some way, but I suddenly airfilled through the entire operation, not doing much.

955
01:31:27.44 --> 01:31:34.32
So your leadership lessons on that deployment were, you know, you got to think, you got, you

956
01:31:34.32 --> 01:31:42.96
can't follow the doctrine all the time. Yeah. Look, green braids are known to be unconventional

957
01:31:42.96 --> 01:31:48.88
in a regular war for experts and thinking outside the box, the idea of, hey, you're not still

958
01:31:48.88 --> 01:31:56.72
when you're acquiring. These creative tasks to bear that benefit you on the ground is what I

959
01:31:56.72 --> 01:32:01.68
learned about. I actually learned that, you know, being in a remote firebase and Afghanistan

960
01:32:01.68 --> 01:32:09.04
with minimal to no resources at all, you had to come up with solutions. So I learned about

961
01:32:09.68 --> 01:32:15.28
establishing problem sets, coming up with creative solutions and the path to execution for those,

962
01:32:15.84 --> 01:32:20.64
which is a formula that I used in, you know, a combat rotation slater.

963
01:32:22.72 --> 01:32:31.04
And you're running a company of 150 Afghans. Yep. Yeah, I ran. So I was the, when I went, I was the

964
01:32:31.04 --> 01:32:35.52
only bravo, typically you run a junior in a senior. I would have been the junior because I was a young

965
01:32:35.52 --> 01:32:41.36
staff sergeant. My senior had surgery so he couldn't show up until later on in the deployment.

966
01:32:41.36 --> 01:32:45.28
My team started came to me like on the first day and he said, hey, there's a formation outside

967
01:32:45.28 --> 01:32:50.24
with your guys. I'm like my guys. Like, yeah, you got 150 Afghans out there. You're the commander.

968
01:32:50.24 --> 01:32:55.36
And I'm like, what? I'm like, Roger that. I go outside. I'm like, guys, let's, let's, let's,

969
01:32:56.24 --> 01:32:59.60
let me give you an in-brief. Let's, we're going to do assessments that give them the plan.

970
01:32:59.60 --> 01:33:04.96
And I have to do it for these dudes. These dudes are looking at me like a machiled and I was, I mean,

971
01:33:04.96 --> 01:33:11.52
it was a 25-year-old child. So they challenged me immediately. One of the guys says to me,

972
01:33:12.88 --> 01:33:19.44
Mike, they want to know if you're a good shooter. And I said, well, what does that assessment look like?

973
01:33:19.44 --> 01:33:24.48
You know, well, what they like to do, I'm like, okay, so this has been done before. What they like to

974
01:33:24.48 --> 01:33:30.24
do is take a piece of bubble gum wrapper and they delaminate it and they put a 1-inch square at 25 yards

975
01:33:30.24 --> 01:33:35.76
on the target and they said, whoever gets closer, whoever's closer wins, but then you earn

976
01:33:35.76 --> 01:33:39.84
our respect. I'm like, did you guys watch a movie man? Is this like, is this the thing? Because I don't,

977
01:33:39.84 --> 01:33:43.52
I don't remember seeing this anywhere. And like, it's, it's part of their traditional, like,

978
01:33:43.52 --> 01:33:50.08
okay, cool. So we get in the prone and I saw the Zords rifle, not it's rifle, AK 47. So,

979
01:33:50.08 --> 01:33:55.68
but no red dot, our iron sights and I don't even know the point of aim or impact on this gun. It's

980
01:33:55.68 --> 01:34:02.96
no dope on it. Oh, it's a random AK. So I said, so I say to the guy, I said, this is the same weapon that

981
01:34:02.96 --> 01:34:09.12
you shoot at the circus at the little red star. Exactly. Notching the star out of the counter fair.

982
01:34:09.76 --> 01:34:14.72
So he sits down and he's a well-respected nurse standing and these guys look like me. I mean,

983
01:34:14.72 --> 01:34:20.000
I look like I belong in that tribe and they're all Chinese influence. And so they all

984
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.20
look up the Asian eyes. And so, rapport initially right off the bat is like accepted,

985
01:34:25.20 --> 01:34:30.000
but I have to prove myself. So this guy gets down the prone and he takes a shot. And we go up

986
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.84
and inspect it and he's like an inch off of the pasty. So I'm thinking of my head, he's holding it

987
01:34:36.64 --> 01:34:41.04
and he's shooting it, but he's a little bit high. And that 25 yards flashed bang. That much

988
01:34:41.04 --> 01:34:46.16
change in muzzle velocity at 25 yards. So I'm thinking, let me just aim at the base of this thing.

989
01:34:46.16 --> 01:34:52.16
So I'll put my I'll probably pop this one inch pasty and I break a shot and it goes through

990
01:34:52.88 --> 01:34:59.44
the piece and try to contain my excitement because I'm like, yeah, I don't want to be like, yeah,

991
01:34:59.44 --> 01:35:05.20
what's up? But I knew it was part of this whole story in this journey. So I go up there and they

992
01:35:05.20 --> 01:35:10.32
they bust out and they're like, yeah, oh my god, they're so excited. And from that moment,

993
01:35:10.32 --> 01:35:15.44
it's like, I was their commander. And we have this relationship where I train them every single day.

994
01:35:15.44 --> 01:35:20.56
I broke bread with them every single day. And it was a beautiful thing, man. I felt like I had a company

995
01:35:20.56 --> 01:35:26.16
worth of valuable human beings who had laid down their life. And when I found out later, and this

996
01:35:26.16 --> 01:35:32.72
is an in hindsight looking back and talking to different guys, when I left, I had those afghan commandos.

997
01:35:32.72 --> 01:35:37.68
I handed them over to another ODA. When third group came back in, they rotated in and there was a

998
01:35:37.68 --> 01:35:46.32
guy by the name of Rob, Rob, Rob something. I can't remember his name. It's a horrible

999
01:35:46.32 --> 01:35:52.48
camera. And he rotated in with him as the 18 Bravo. So when he gets in that position,

1000
01:35:53.60 --> 01:36:00.72
he starts grooming these guys and they're telling stories of that circumstance. So as this

1001
01:36:00.72 --> 01:36:06.48
evolves later in the war, I find out that one of the guys that we had from third group that was

1002
01:36:06.48 --> 01:36:13.12
killed postusiously in a gunfight, running uphill with a machine gun. Gets killed,

1003
01:36:13.76 --> 01:36:20.56
earns the metal of honor and dies fighting side by side with these same guys. In fact, some of

1004
01:36:20.56 --> 01:36:27.36
those guys that I trained were killed in that action, where a third group of guys won the metal

1005
01:36:27.36 --> 01:36:32.48
earned the metal of honor, sacrifices life. But those afghans died on that same hilltop,

1006
01:36:32.48 --> 01:36:39.36
running uphill against an enemy, machine gun, nested position. And I'm like, dude, I mean,

1007
01:36:39.36 --> 01:36:45.60
you look for all the light and darkness and I'm like, man, that means the world to me,

1008
01:36:45.60 --> 01:36:52.40
that maybe I had an impact on these men that stood side by side and fought uphill. And that

1009
01:36:52.40 --> 01:36:58.96
truly meant a lot. And so those guys, you earn their respect, you operate with them. But when I

1010
01:36:58.96 --> 01:37:02.96
left him, it was the, I felt like they into the world. And you know, you talk to guys like John

1011
01:37:02.96 --> 01:37:07.92
Strike or Meyer, that's a common thing. It's something that we're not very good at. In fact, we're

1012
01:37:07.92 --> 01:37:12.88
pretty horrible at. And now, of course, you must be kind of sick. You're stomach seeing that we're

1013
01:37:12.88 --> 01:37:20.40
pulling out. And those guys will either be rounded up and killed or they'll join the Taliban

1014
01:37:20.40 --> 01:37:26.64
because that's what they got to do to stay alive. More likely, all the intel has been leaked already.

1015
01:37:26.64 --> 01:37:31.76
They already know who they are and they have their target deck built. And right now, I mean, if you

1016
01:37:31.76 --> 01:37:35.68
look at all the different places, especially the remote places of Afghanistan, which is very

1017
01:37:35.68 --> 01:37:41.68
tribal, very geographically regionally, there are already taken over. I mean, they'll have the

1018
01:37:41.68 --> 01:37:47.60
estimates from the experts is in the next six months, a boggroom and can are, we'll fall to the

1019
01:37:47.60 --> 01:37:53.12
Taliban. If not sooner, because there was a formal agreement, a diplomatic agreement, that means

1020
01:37:53.12 --> 01:37:58.000
they're supposed to take over in some capacity anyway. But what that means to the rest of the

1021
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.72
men that we fought off all over the country, all these guys will be rolled up and more likely

1022
01:38:02.72 --> 01:38:11.84
executed, which is a damn shame. Yes, here in some reports that the Taliban would go to, you know,

1023
01:38:11.84 --> 01:38:15.84
some of these villages or whatever, and send a note into the police chief and say, hey, man,

1024
01:38:17.04 --> 01:38:21.44
yeah, it's over. You can get on board or we're going to kill you and kill your family. And

1025
01:38:21.44 --> 01:38:27.20
the police chief or whatever local Afghan leaders, like Roger that, you know, I'm on board.

1026
01:38:27.92 --> 01:38:34.08
And that's that. Yeah, those guys, just like an Iraq, just like I've experienced in Yemen,

1027
01:38:34.64 --> 01:38:43.44
in Pakistan, in Africa, it's a vicious cycle that doesn't stop and we don't learn those lessons.

1028
01:38:44.40 --> 01:38:48.32
But I don't know the answer. I don't know the solution. I mean, make it in citizens and bring

1029
01:38:48.32 --> 01:38:52.88
them out, taking the fighting force that's the most capable human beings there and doing that.

1030
01:38:52.88 --> 01:38:56.32
I don't know what the answer is, but it's a horrible thing that I know is transpire,

1031
01:38:56.32 --> 01:39:02.000
likely right now. So you get done with that deployment?

1032
01:39:03.36 --> 01:39:09.04
Yeah, I've get done with Afghanistan immediately come back and go to a Sephardic, which is our

1033
01:39:09.92 --> 01:39:16.000
version of advanced CQB, HOSIS rescue, to be alive with a DA company, you know, the, when I work with the

1034
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.84
CQB, the CILS and OSIXO7, all the, the latter rotations, it was mostly with a company called

1035
01:39:23.84 --> 01:39:28.64
the Commander in Extremist Force, which has now been renamed the Crisis Response Force, which has

1036
01:39:28.64 --> 01:39:37.04
been reclaimed deep underground unit for tunnels and stuff. So get part of that unit, which our

1037
01:39:37.04 --> 01:39:46.48
focus is DA, SR, HR, and get through Sephardic, no problems, and get immediately reassigned to the

1038
01:39:46.48 --> 01:39:52.72
Commander's in Extremist Force, which is hopping on a plane the next month to go down a range.

1039
01:39:52.72 --> 01:39:56.56
So how long are you home for? Four months, home for four months.

1040
01:39:57.12 --> 01:40:02.88
How long is that deployment to Afghanistan? Nine months total. Yeah. So nine months, get back,

1041
01:40:02.88 --> 01:40:09.52
do Sephardic for two months, and then get about a month and a half before we burn out for Iraq

1042
01:40:09.52 --> 01:40:14.16
for Baghdad. Have you gotten married or anything at this point? Yeah, I actually got about that.

1043
01:40:14.16 --> 01:40:20.56
I actually got married right before this rotation, and in a courthouse, I grabbed my

1044
01:40:20.56 --> 01:40:26.48
past away at that same time period, didn't get a lot of time to have any kind of anything

1045
01:40:26.48 --> 01:40:29.44
with the family, and then we were turning it in burden for Iraq.

1046
01:40:29.44 --> 01:40:36.96
Four months home, and now what's this deployment? So this is now your first deployment to Iraq.

1047
01:40:36.96 --> 01:40:44.88
First of all, I'm going down a range in CT is the, and this is O6. O6.

1048
01:40:44.88 --> 01:40:50.16
Yeah. And so you ended up working in Baghdad. In Baghdad, Baghdad,

1049
01:40:50.16 --> 01:40:57.36
it's our national airport. We were at camp, not camp, and it's area four. So we staged the area

1050
01:40:57.36 --> 01:41:03.28
four, and a couple of mission sets, working with Iraq, and counterterrorism forces, working with

1051
01:41:03.28 --> 01:41:09.04
task force, as a, you don't matter a force, and then working with the ERU, which is the emergency

1052
01:41:09.04 --> 01:41:14.48
response unit, the equivalent of the FBI HRT that prosecutes targets in Iraq.

1053
01:41:14.48 --> 01:41:18.48
Iraq, that's an Iraqi unit. Iraq just for everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1054
01:41:18.48 --> 01:41:24.40
So the ICTF is an Iraqi unit there in Iraqi unit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1055
01:41:24.40 --> 01:41:33.36
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Almost acted like the Mike force until, you know, the

1056
01:41:33.36 --> 01:41:39.52
Mike force strike unit until we get there, and we start doing joint operations with napsoff

1057
01:41:39.52 --> 01:41:45.12
and then the SIF. So it's, it's like a couple guys from my SIF company, which was B23, the third

1058
01:41:45.12 --> 01:41:52.56
group SIF, working hand in hand with six or seven guys from a silver tomb. And we would go out

1059
01:41:52.56 --> 01:41:58.08
and at the time, we weren't, they weren't doing operations with Americans because a company,

1060
01:41:58.08 --> 01:42:02.88
a contract with company was training them, but they weren't, advising them, but they weren't doing

1061
01:42:02.88 --> 01:42:07.36
counterterrorism operations. So we actually took over and started doing the first counterterrorism

1062
01:42:07.36 --> 01:42:15.68
operations with them side by side using our assets to bear, but doing the true CT for an internal

1063
01:42:15.68 --> 01:42:19.60
defense mission. So you're rolling out a hidden targets? Hidden targets. Every night.

1064
01:42:19.60 --> 01:42:24.88
It's basically what this is. Yeah. Smashed in targets every night. I mean, our, our PDSS, our pre-department

1065
01:42:24.88 --> 01:42:29.92
deployment site survey, we got it again, fight and kill dudes and our PDSS. So we were like,

1066
01:42:29.92 --> 01:42:33.52
it's going to be a hot year. And that was a year you were there. Yeah. Yeah. I was over and

1067
01:42:33.52 --> 01:42:37.12
a body. You guys were down and back then. You were working alongside some of the guys I was with.

1068
01:42:37.92 --> 01:42:47.36
Well, that I knew over there. Just basically nightly ops. Reverse cycle nightly ops. We had a

1069
01:42:47.36 --> 01:42:52.96
cycle of, you know, red amber green, your train dudes. Even if you're training dudes, you're probably

1070
01:42:52.96 --> 01:43:00.000
gunning on trucks or acting as a machine gunner on half, on helicopter assaults, but every single

1071
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
night we were prosecuted targets. Sometimes two, three targets, the night, depending on what was going on.

1072
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.52
So we had a target deck. Everybody else in task force had a target deck. And at the time,

1073
01:43:09.52 --> 01:43:19.12
which was in transition for the big surge, we were prosecuting at the time, she-a-based targets.

1074
01:43:19.12 --> 01:43:26.16
And so, Mooktaal, Saadr, and his network of shitheads, we were going after every night.

1075
01:43:27.04 --> 01:43:29.92
Were you working mostly in the round Baghdad or all over their country?

1076
01:43:30.48 --> 01:43:35.60
Pretty much all over the country. I mean, we have with Navy assets, flying us out the 60s.

1077
01:43:35.60 --> 01:43:43.84
We were using Pavelo or the 53. Or you use some task force 160. So little birds, 60s,

1078
01:43:43.84 --> 01:43:49.12
depending on what was going on. It was all over, all over. And what was your specific job on this

1079
01:43:49.12 --> 01:43:53.92
deployment? So I was an assaulter. I mean, in the SIF, I was an assaulter, I was a breacher.

1080
01:43:54.64 --> 01:44:00.08
I actually was deployed with, at the time, Jeremy Wise. Jeremy Wise was a young

1081
01:44:00.08 --> 01:44:06.24
East Coast-based silt team member who wanted up getting killed with the CIA as a global response

1082
01:44:06.24 --> 01:44:14.48
staff officer. He possibly was awarded the CIA star. And we were both breaches together.

1083
01:44:15.28 --> 01:44:22.64
So every night we did breaches. We did unilateral pieces of our up. So a couple of Americans,

1084
01:44:22.64 --> 01:44:27.60
like me and another SIF guy, and like three or five seals would go out and do our piece. We'd hit

1085
01:44:27.60 --> 01:44:32.56
one building and then the Iraqis we were with with with another building. So get a lateral

1086
01:44:32.56 --> 01:44:37.20
assaulter is basically what we were. It's radically different deployment than what you did in Afghanistan.

1087
01:44:37.20 --> 01:44:43.04
I mean, not even the same freaking ballpark in saying completely different. I try to use some of the,

1088
01:44:43.04 --> 01:44:47.12
you know, the similarities where we were training them in the back end. But these guys,

1089
01:44:47.92 --> 01:44:52.48
if you saw them operating when they're kid, you would think they're Americans. Like competent

1090
01:44:52.48 --> 01:44:58.000
assaulters, snipers, Americans. Yeah, and they had all American gear and weapons because I was telling

1091
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.88
you I went over on PDSS and because we were going to go, I actually, if that would happen,

1092
01:45:02.88 --> 01:45:05.76
I would have been collocated with you and we would have been running the same out. We would already

1093
01:45:05.76 --> 01:45:10.72
know each other. We'd be bros. Yeah, we'd run together. Yeah, we'd have rolled out. But we ended up

1094
01:45:10.72 --> 01:45:17.04
not going to re-end it going to Ramadhi and said, but yeah, the, the, the ICTF and the EREU had, like,

1095
01:45:17.04 --> 01:45:21.44
American issued weapons. They had night vision had everything, everything, everything. Yeah,

1096
01:45:21.44 --> 01:45:26.32
they had everything. And they were well trained, well trained. They had to be the best trained,

1097
01:45:26.32 --> 01:45:32.96
and most reliable Iraqi soldiers by a landslide. Yeah, the combination of the Iraqi counterterrorism

1098
01:45:32.96 --> 01:45:38.32
force, which we pulled out a, I rack and adjordan and isolate and trained. And the EREU that

1099
01:45:38.32 --> 01:45:47.04
turned into the emergency response battalion, were the highest paid trained experienced units that

1100
01:45:47.04 --> 01:45:52.56
eventually took ISIS. These same guys, I lost probably half my fighting force that I worked

1101
01:45:52.56 --> 01:45:58.64
with over the years against the fight against ISIS in 2014 when we pulled our guys out and

1102
01:45:58.64 --> 01:46:03.76
those dudes went to war. I mean, they went to Missouri, they went to Baghdad, they went to Kurdistan,

1103
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:10.16
they were fighting in their bill. They were probably with close air support, meaning the JTAC

1104
01:46:10.16 --> 01:46:16.000
peace with the sole reasons that ISIS doesn't exist in Iraq today. So it's, it's a, it was a long

1105
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:22.56
road ahead of them. We were just in the beginning stages of it. What did you prefer for the deployment?

1106
01:46:22.56 --> 01:46:27.68
What did you like doing better? Man, that's a tough question. So different, so different, right?

1107
01:46:28.40 --> 01:46:34.16
But in the things that I enjoyed like overlanding across Afghanistan and the wild west,

1108
01:46:35.20 --> 01:46:41.52
with not a lot of oversight and just wing in it and learning a lot of lessons in that

1109
01:46:41.52 --> 01:46:47.20
versus that deliberate like land on the X, fast-repaunt off of the building and kill bad guys.

1110
01:46:47.76 --> 01:46:52.88
I enjoy them both. I mean, if I could have, if I could overland to an objective and fast-repaunt

1111
01:46:52.88 --> 01:46:56.80
off of it, that whole combination, it'd be perfect. Man, I love both of them.

1112
01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.36
And then how long was this deployment to Baghdad six months? Yeah, so we were doing six month rotations.

1113
01:47:03.76 --> 01:47:08.80
Did you, did you guys take any casualties on that deployment? We did. We took every

1114
01:47:08.80 --> 01:47:13.44
deployment that we wanted to take and we wanted to lose an esteemed guy. So we were working with

1115
01:47:13.44 --> 01:47:20.88
joint task force, which included tier one units and the Rangers and us and the Navy. You guys were

1116
01:47:20.88 --> 01:47:26.96
taking casualties. There was EFTs that were affecting guys, gun fights. We took a casualty.

1117
01:47:26.96 --> 01:47:32.88
One of my guys and my troop was killed. That rotation, tongue-no-in was killed. And then

1118
01:47:32.88 --> 01:47:38.64
time apart, purple hard, students get in gun fights. It was an active year.

1119
01:47:40.88 --> 01:47:45.28
Was, was tongue the first guy that you lost that was in your actual element?

1120
01:47:46.40 --> 01:47:49.84
Yeah, and that was on my team and my troop first, first did.

1121
01:47:52.08 --> 01:47:57.36
Didn't know him great. I mean, I knew him. I was a new guy there, but one of the most respected

1122
01:47:57.36 --> 01:48:02.88
members of that unit. I mean, he was the guy on the PDSS with his long gun who wound it up killing

1123
01:48:02.88 --> 01:48:08.64
like three bad dudes on a PDSS. I mean, who goes TTY and kills a few dudes comes back after,

1124
01:48:09.36 --> 01:48:14.64
getting in town like, you got some intel on target. He was that kind of guy.

1125
01:48:14.64 --> 01:48:21.28
Vietnamese descent too. So me and him were the only Asians in that group. He took, he took,

1126
01:48:21.28 --> 01:48:28.56
he took his job serious and when he saw me come into the company, he took me on earth's wing

1127
01:48:28.56 --> 01:48:33.68
and he tried to take care of me. He experienced a soldier, belonged to C11, which is the first group's

1128
01:48:33.68 --> 01:48:38.32
sift and did a whole bunch of operations and the Philippines all over Southeast Asia.

1129
01:48:38.88 --> 01:48:43.92
And just a highly respected dude. I mean, just a great guy. And when, how deep into the

1130
01:48:43.92 --> 01:48:49.20
point was that? Man, right, I'll pick eight. I mean, it was only a couple months in. We still had

1131
01:48:49.20 --> 01:48:55.12
four months of that rotation. And then at the end of our rotation was the surge. So we got super

1132
01:48:55.12 --> 01:49:01.20
hot, super active. Probably some of the closest experiences to death I had in that, and that

1133
01:49:01.20 --> 01:49:07.68
rotation for me personally. From gun fights, from IEDs, now gun fights. I mean, I was on a

1134
01:49:08.56 --> 01:49:13.44
roof top in Saudar City once in a sniper over watch position for a horse's rescue.

1135
01:49:13.44 --> 01:49:18.24
Got pinned down to the roof. I had a big army sniper team that was with me.

1136
01:49:18.24 --> 01:49:26.64
That, that one and a half hour gun fight, small arms, RPGs, water rounds, all in the same

1137
01:49:27.92 --> 01:49:33.44
gun fight, all on our position. Under the frigate, I was like, you know, laying on the roof, trying

1138
01:49:33.44 --> 01:49:37.20
to keep my head flat and staying in the fight. Because we had a retreat option. We couldn't

1139
01:49:37.20 --> 01:49:42.88
went down into the building into the third story that we were on. And I looked over in my buddy Chris,

1140
01:49:42.88 --> 01:49:49.28
because there's only two of us with a big army sniper unit was laying underneath the satellite

1141
01:49:49.28 --> 01:49:55.68
dish. And we're, the three stories high. So we're above most of the city, but there's still

1142
01:49:55.68 --> 01:50:00.88
second and third story buildings inside Saudar City. And he's getting the satellite dish

1143
01:50:00.88 --> 01:50:06.56
disintegrated over his ass a couple feet over his butt. And I'm like, oh, these guys are close.

1144
01:50:06.56 --> 01:50:10.88
They have his dad, they have them us down in. And then I looked up in the sky,

1145
01:50:10.88 --> 01:50:15.52
because I something caught my attention, I looked up and there was RPGs air bursting above us.

1146
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:21.60
And I'm like, this is not good. So we, we basically started way laying in bad guys that were

1147
01:50:22.56 --> 01:50:27.52
squirting into the objective, like trying to infill on containment. And that were breaking contact

1148
01:50:27.52 --> 01:50:34.16
out of the objective. And all black, body militia dudes, black pajama kind of guys. And a lot of

1149
01:50:34.16 --> 01:50:42.48
it was command and control because we had cast, I had control, I had comms with a closer support F-16

1150
01:50:42.48 --> 01:50:48.64
that was above us. And we were trying to relay and report all the information, but we were having comms

1151
01:50:48.64 --> 01:50:56.56
problems. So what low that fight, you know, in the long story of it, what low that fight was in F-16

1152
01:50:56.56 --> 01:51:05.04
because I marked a V-S-17 panel in the middle of that roof came out of its rotation, its orbit,

1153
01:51:05.04 --> 01:51:11.44
and over 500 feet above our building did a pass and pop flaters. I thought he was going to do a

1154
01:51:11.44 --> 01:51:16.16
gun running kill us all because we lost comms. So I popped that V-S-17 and I looked up and he

1155
01:51:16.16 --> 01:51:21.52
started banging in and I'm like yelled at my combo guy and I'm like, do we have any comms? And he

1156
01:51:21.52 --> 01:51:28.16
came down and ran the perimeter road which I think was, he's called home base, we're at the base

1157
01:51:28.16 --> 01:51:34.08
of a leg of Sauder City from home base to third base. He ran that entire road at 500 feet,

1158
01:51:34.08 --> 01:51:39.52
turned his wings, you can almost see his face and pop flaters and it rolled the gun and

1159
01:51:39.52 --> 01:51:45.44
fight enough for us to get out, break contact into Bradley's and break contact. We killed,

1160
01:51:45.44 --> 01:51:51.92
I mean, total turned that up over 100 dudes and got a shut down for like a month on a side

1161
01:51:51.92 --> 01:51:58.08
of city. I mean, tanks were destroying buildings five feet in front of them because they were,

1162
01:51:58.08 --> 01:52:02.16
I mean, they were just getting smashed with RPGs and everything else. Pretty pretty darn again,

1163
01:52:02.16 --> 01:52:08.24
fight. And that was the end of year to point at a no-6? About mid-rotation, that was about mid-rotation.

1164
01:52:08.24 --> 01:52:22.32
Good times. Then you come back, do another work up? Instant work up, getting ready for a new

1165
01:52:22.32 --> 01:52:31.52
deployment and then we go down range. O7's different beast, the height of Alkaira. On the

1166
01:52:31.52 --> 01:52:36.72
tailland of that rotation the surge begins, the Sunni strategy, they start the Suns of Iraq,

1167
01:52:36.72 --> 01:52:42.56
they start empowering Sunni's. There's a war going on between the Sunni's and she is. And

1168
01:52:42.56 --> 01:52:48.40
typically it's like, you know, the exotic city versus everybody else in the country. And now the

1169
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:56.56
Sunni's are getting supported by the US. So we're going to war with Iran back, she is. And we get

1170
01:52:56.56 --> 01:53:03.44
into that rotation. And our task force does a couple things. They have a mission set where they go,

1171
01:53:03.44 --> 01:53:07.84
hey, you guys are going to go and do bilateral operations, working with indigenous guys, like

1172
01:53:07.84 --> 01:53:13.84
ICTF, like ERU, like we talked about. But there's another component our mission set where we work

1173
01:53:13.84 --> 01:53:22.88
with J-Sock. I joined Task Force. So we were under joint task force conducting counterterrorism

1174
01:53:22.88 --> 01:53:30.72
operations, hunting HVT's on a deck for J-Sock as part of one of their action arms, that

1175
01:53:30.72 --> 01:53:37.04
whole entire rotation. And it was epic. It was one of my best rotations. If listen, so this is now

1176
01:53:37.04 --> 01:53:42.88
07, you're back over there. Oh seven Iraq. Yeah. In Baghdad again. Yeah, we're at Fernandez and

1177
01:53:42.88 --> 01:53:49.20
SS Fernandez named after a unit guy was killed. And you're doing and you're doing one hit, you're

1178
01:53:49.20 --> 01:53:55.44
working with the Indage one night. And then two nights later, you get a package from J-Sock and you're

1179
01:53:55.44 --> 01:53:59.68
going out and hit that target. So we divided our troops. Oh, okay. So my troops just doing

1180
01:53:59.68 --> 01:54:04.88
you to a lot of rocks. Who was killing the bad guys? Later on the X every night. Just kidding. Yeah,

1181
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:11.44
I was crank. Yeah. That was how big is your unit that you're working with? 20. So our

1182
01:54:11.44 --> 01:54:16.48
troop is about 20 plus guys. And at the time, I'm a sniper now. So I moved over to the sniper

1183
01:54:16.48 --> 01:54:24.64
section. So I'm a sniper team supporting to assault teams for hits every single night. So my

1184
01:54:24.64 --> 01:54:28.72
job specifically was containment. So I was setting a establishing containment. A lot of building

1185
01:54:28.72 --> 01:54:35.52
climbing that rotation. A lot of Overwatch killing squirters running out of buildings,

1186
01:54:35.52 --> 01:54:41.36
killing bad guys trying to get to the fight. And it was like the gloves are off. I mean,

1187
01:54:41.36 --> 01:54:47.60
the strategy that we got passed down and rules of engagement were killed them all. And that's

1188
01:54:47.60 --> 01:54:52.64
what that's what we were doing. And so it was an epic rotation. We had a lot of HVT's, a lot of foreign

1189
01:54:52.64 --> 01:55:01.60
fighters, a lot of gun fights, a lot of casualties on our side. And a lot of dead bad guys.

1190
01:55:03.36 --> 01:55:07.20
Were you guys mostly taking vehicles or are you doing helicopters all the time? Most of it was

1191
01:55:07.20 --> 01:55:13.20
half was helicopter assaults with little birds and in the eight sixties. So all black hoax and little birds.

1192
01:55:13.20 --> 01:55:17.20
Every, I think pretty much every night it was that. I don't remember too many ground assaults.

1193
01:55:17.20 --> 01:55:21.76
A couple here and there in the strikers. If we had to go to Soder City, we took

1194
01:55:21.76 --> 01:55:29.36
tanks that would lead the way into the Soder City, suck up all the EFPs. We called them Team Rock.

1195
01:55:29.36 --> 01:55:34.16
They would get blown up for us even to the point. Yeah, even to the point where these guys would

1196
01:55:34.16 --> 01:55:37.52
get blown up, they'd pull over to the side of the road and we just bypassed. They were just the

1197
01:55:37.52 --> 01:55:43.84
bridge point. And they were the hammer we were going through and hitting our surgical targets.

1198
01:55:44.56 --> 01:55:51.28
It was a great rotation man. We lost a guy. One of our team guys, Justin Monchky was killed,

1199
01:55:51.28 --> 01:55:57.52
stepped on a pressure plate ID. We had about, uh, in my company, we had about 15 purple hearts.

1200
01:55:57.52 --> 01:56:03.12
So a lot of dudes injured shot, blown up. Um, and a lot, we killed a lot of bad guys. I mean,

1201
01:56:03.12 --> 01:56:08.32
it was a good trip for a killing bad guys. How are these, um, you're, what, what's your position

1202
01:56:08.32 --> 01:56:13.92
and as far as leadership inside the company here? So I'm, uh, I'm a two IC. So I'm

1203
01:56:13.92 --> 01:56:20.16
right behind my cell leader, um, as a new sniper. Um, so I do it my cell leader at the time Jason,

1204
01:56:20.16 --> 01:56:28.16
uh, tells me to do. And most of my role is because I was pretty lean and a good climber

1205
01:56:28.96 --> 01:56:32.88
me and a couple of the other guys were on the climbing team. And so if we had a containment set,

1206
01:56:32.88 --> 01:56:38.88
we hit a building. We used ladders or even building climb traverse ladders, um, from building

1207
01:56:38.88 --> 01:56:44.72
to building and set and tame it from a high position. We called high team to be able to contain the

1208
01:56:44.72 --> 01:56:50.08
objective from top down while the assaulters hit a deliberate target set. So traditional

1209
01:56:50.08 --> 01:56:56.72
countdown's 5432. Breach goes off at 2 and then we hit the target. And you're doing it in

1210
01:56:56.72 --> 01:57:01.52
an op and night, basically. Sometimes the other, yeah, sometimes a couple more than that. Yeah,

1211
01:57:01.52 --> 01:57:08.72
but we a lot of this, this time period was, um, taking advantage of SSC. There was an emphasis on

1212
01:57:08.72 --> 01:57:13.84
sensitive site exploitation. Doing a lot of posts analysis on the objective, a lot of tactical

1213
01:57:13.84 --> 01:57:21.20
interrogation to lend itself to taking advantage of the opportunity on a target and flexing to other

1214
01:57:21.20 --> 01:57:28.08
targets to take down networks. So super aggressive, the combination of two two, uh, SAS Ranger

1215
01:57:28.08 --> 01:57:35.12
Battalion, uh, Cag, us and, and Def, uh, five action arms under task 416. And this is Stanley

1216
01:57:35.12 --> 01:57:44.16
McCrissel's big project, right, his, his, um, his big, uh, machine of war. What, what, what it was was

1217
01:57:44.16 --> 01:57:49.04
one of the most significant, I think, most significant strategies in the war, especially a

1218
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:58.08
patrition of taking out bad guys. As you're, be talked about, um, you're, you're losing some guys now.

1219
01:57:58.08 --> 01:58:06.24
How's, how's your, um, how are you guys handling that? So the reason I asked this question is

1220
01:58:06.24 --> 01:58:11.60
because somebody's going to be listening to this in 10 years or 17 years or 23 years and we're

1221
01:58:11.60 --> 01:58:15.52
going to be in a situation where there hasn't been any casualties in a long time and all the

1222
01:58:15.52 --> 01:58:21.84
sudden someone's going out and doing what, doing what soldiers do and they're going to take casualties.

1223
01:58:21.84 --> 01:58:27.28
And I know when I, when I took my first casualties and had lost my first guys, there was no one

1224
01:58:27.28 --> 01:58:32.64
that was telling me like, hey, here's what you got to think about. Not just from a, look, we get the

1225
01:58:32.64 --> 01:58:37.12
protocol of, hey, here's the, here's the book that we're going to follow. Here's the calls we got to make,

1226
01:58:37.68 --> 01:58:41.76
but now you got a bunch of guys that just lost one of their best friends and what are you going to do

1227
01:58:41.76 --> 01:58:52.72
about that? How did you guys go about it? Great question. Um, a lot of responses that are, um,

1228
01:58:52.72 --> 01:59:01.92
doctrinal would have guys stand down have a moments if not days of mourning a process.

1229
01:59:03.12 --> 01:59:12.88
Um, I remember when we lost tongue in O6 are immediate strategy at the tactical level. So

1230
01:59:12.88 --> 01:59:19.12
you talking cell leaders and trip-smart majors said, listen, we're not waiting. We're hitting targets

1231
01:59:19.12 --> 01:59:30.32
tonight and we got aggressive and we went out in in O6 and O7 we had a vindiction, um, vindication board.

1232
01:59:31.44 --> 01:59:36.88
This vindication board was, uh, filled with team guys that we lost and there was dozens of

1233
01:59:37.28 --> 01:59:43.60
on one side and when you killed a bad guy because you took that call sign patch and then, you know,

1234
01:59:43.60 --> 01:59:49.20
if you were as Tony Yoset, who was a third group team sergeant, I was killed, you would just carry TY on your

1235
01:59:49.20 --> 01:59:55.84
left shoulder under your call sign patch and if you killed a bad guy and you were successful on

1236
01:59:55.84 --> 02:00:01.20
your mission, you'd come back and you put it on the vindicated side and we had all the pictures of

1237
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:06.96
the guys that were killed on that and every night we'd fill that board and cycle them back and forth

1238
02:00:06.96 --> 02:00:16.000
because, um, we understood that getting killed was a part of the job, comparatively and you know this

1239
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:23.60
you're very skilled in the history of warfare including the Vietnam War where thousands, 60 plus

1240
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:28.48
thousand Americans were killed, sometimes hundreds in certain battles were killed, entire Mac

1241
02:00:28.48 --> 02:00:35.36
V. Sog teams taken off the planet, they accepted that risk. So when we lost guys in our community,

1242
02:00:35.36 --> 02:00:40.40
there was no morning, there wasn't time to mourn, we get back on helicopters, I remember

1243
02:00:40.40 --> 02:00:46.40
something that really stands out to me from the O7 trip, we lost two to S.A.S. guys, they were killed

1244
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:51.92
on target in order to have three of them that were killed. The task force commander had us come

1245
02:00:51.92 --> 02:01:00.08
outside and the two to S.A.S. commander briefed five different task units and he spoke to warfare

1246
02:01:00.08 --> 02:01:07.20
and he spoke to the importance of understanding the fight we're in, how this works and getting back

1247
02:01:07.20 --> 02:01:13.52
in the fight. It was of 10 minutes spill and we're all sitting there in kit with guns in our specific

1248
02:01:13.52 --> 02:01:19.04
units and at the end of the speech he gives a hand in arm signal and all the little birds and all

1249
02:01:19.04 --> 02:01:26.000
this 60 spin up and we load five different task forces up in little birds and MH60s and fly away

1250
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:33.52
and smash bad guys. That whole experience was what the task force was, depending on what unit you

1251
02:01:33.52 --> 02:01:39.20
were, you might have that experience but if you weren't task force that was the experience of

1252
02:01:39.20 --> 02:01:43.60
night. We accept that risk, we lost guys and then we got back in the fight because we had no time

1253
02:01:43.60 --> 02:01:52.80
to mourn. It wasn't a time for mourning. That's um, same strategy I had, you know, got to get your

1254
02:01:52.80 --> 02:01:58.80
ship back on, get your gear back on, and go back out and do what you're supposed to do and do

1255
02:01:58.80 --> 02:02:07.76
what your boys would want you to do exactly. Yeah. Any good leadership lessons or any

1256
02:02:07.76 --> 02:02:12.96
leadership lessons from that deployment that stand out? The biggest one is I'll say his name

1257
02:02:12.96 --> 02:02:19.04
not because he's retired. He was the commander that we worked under as name was Tom D. Tumaso.

1258
02:02:19.04 --> 02:02:26.32
It was aatoon leader blackhawk down as a young ranger at the time was a cag commander and he was

1259
02:02:26.32 --> 02:02:33.36
our commander. When we got to that country we had gotten used to the way that we did business,

1260
02:02:33.36 --> 02:02:38.000
breaching blowing every door, shooting back guys in the face and he briefed us and he said,

1261
02:02:38.64 --> 02:02:44.88
man we're going to start this new tactic this year and it's called callouts and we laughed. We joked.

1262
02:02:44.88 --> 02:02:53.20
It was comical to us. We even wrote drew cartoons about how comical this whole tactic was.

1263
02:02:53.20 --> 02:02:57.36
So let me get this straight. You want us to go to a building, land little birds offset,

1264
02:02:57.36 --> 02:03:01.92
serapticiously approach and then knock essentially knock and call them out.

1265
02:03:03.04 --> 02:03:07.92
Yes, that's what we want you to do. So the whole time we're like this is ridiculous. This is insane.

1266
02:03:07.92 --> 02:03:14.72
Until we hit a foreign safe house that had Libyan foreign fighters and in the war in Iraq,

1267
02:03:15.68 --> 02:03:21.76
positions two and four out of the top four guys killed on the battlefield that were killing Americans.

1268
02:03:21.76 --> 02:03:28.08
Formatable foes were from Libya, two and four. Number one was Saudi Arabia. Number two was Libya.

1269
02:03:29.84 --> 02:03:34.64
Out of these foreign fighters, they were training the Green Mountains of Libya.

1270
02:03:34.64 --> 02:03:39.28
They had gear that was comparable to ours. A solo boots,

1271
02:03:39.84 --> 02:03:48.000
Santo watches, chess rigs, suicide vest, proper guns with red dot optics and all the tactics

1272
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:56.48
to bear. We hit a foreign safe house offset on infill, which was about a 4k, 2 to 4k offset,

1273
02:03:57.04 --> 02:04:00.40
which is offsetting away from the objective so you don't get compromised.

1274
02:04:00.40 --> 02:04:07.52
We get compromised by a early warning position. Our little bird attack helicopter kills six dudes

1275
02:04:07.52 --> 02:04:12.80
run off the bat on infill. Birds get straight at the bird. I'm in the 60. I'm in feet hanging off

1276
02:04:12.80 --> 02:04:21.20
the 60 takes incoming rounds in between us and the chalk in front of us. We land, we make movement.

1277
02:04:21.92 --> 02:04:26.56
We think there's a couple of foreign fighters. There's 13 and they're also decided bested out.

1278
02:04:26.56 --> 02:04:32.80
Long story short, I have a dog, save my life, a cag dog, but a new move.

1279
02:04:33.52 --> 02:04:35.76
But a suicide bomber 15 meters in front of me.

1280
02:04:36.80 --> 02:04:41.52
Sacrifice his life for mine. We get into the house, we kill everybody.

1281
02:04:42.24 --> 02:04:49.76
We establish SSE after objective secure and realize they have pk, machine guns,

1282
02:04:49.76 --> 02:04:55.12
barricaded and sandbag positions. A threshold deep away from the reach point.

1283
02:04:55.12 --> 02:04:59.52
If we'd have reached that like every target set we'd reach before prior we would all die.

1284
02:04:59.52 --> 02:05:04.08
We would have got the first assault element would have been zipped up. They would have broke contact out of back

1285
02:05:04.08 --> 02:05:09.52
and we'd been fighting for allies. We were fighting for allies in containment. We had offset containment called the mount

1286
02:05:09.52 --> 02:05:13.12
and we were in a hand-to-hand range.

1287
02:05:13.12 --> 02:05:19.36
So you did that up doing containment and doing a callout on them? We did. We did exactly what he trained us to do.

1288
02:05:19.36 --> 02:05:24.88
And even in that, I mean I threw six hand grenades on the other side of a berm

1289
02:05:25.68 --> 02:05:31.12
and direct engagement in contact with enemy. I mean the hand grenades I was throwing with my teammate

1290
02:05:31.12 --> 02:05:35.44
were landing in bad guys laps on the other side of the berm. These dudes were ready to get it on.

1291
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:41.36
We decimated the target with 105s from a spectrogunship. We recovered Vinnie's body.

1292
02:05:41.36 --> 02:05:51.84
And then we dropped a J-DAM on an ex-film and daylight. We got back Vinnie was covered in American flag.

1293
02:05:51.84 --> 02:06:00.64
The whole task was there to salute us. We got blood on our shoes. Some dudes are injured and we're like

1294
02:06:01.92 --> 02:06:07.60
this makes sense. I realized from that experience,

1295
02:06:07.60 --> 02:06:14.48
don't be in a rush to die. So many guys want to get on the ex and they want to do this thing called

1296
02:06:14.48 --> 02:06:20.72
kicking indoors and shoot back as in the face. But they don't understand the tactics and techniques

1297
02:06:20.72 --> 02:06:27.60
procedures evolve every single day at the speed of war. And it was the realization where I had

1298
02:06:27.60 --> 02:06:32.24
the coolest guy because he's the coolest commander of the coolest unit telling us something that

1299
02:06:32.24 --> 02:06:38.96
it seemed cool and then that realization coming home and going down. Okay, now we got a change tactics.

1300
02:06:38.96 --> 02:06:44.72
We got to think outside the box. We can't get, we can't conform to convention and to routine

1301
02:06:44.72 --> 02:06:49.12
and think it's going to be the right solution every single time because times change. And that was a

1302
02:06:49.12 --> 02:06:56.48
huge impact on my career moving forward. Yeah, I went through a similar transition in O-304 where

1303
02:06:56.48 --> 02:07:03.12
we were breaching every door and we ended up hurting some people, you know, and sometimes not the

1304
02:07:03.12 --> 02:07:08.80
right people. And we started getting some pressure like, hey, you can't just keep doing this.

1305
02:07:09.52 --> 02:07:13.52
And so, well, if you're not going to explosively breach, then that leaves you mechanically

1306
02:07:13.52 --> 02:07:16.48
breaching. If you're mechanically breaching, well, now you're sitting there with the Hoolie,

1307
02:07:16.48 --> 02:07:23.20
swinging at a door and now you're really exposed. So why not just take a step back and say,

1308
02:07:23.20 --> 02:07:28.08
hey, get the turpa on the horn and tell these guys to come out. And now we kind of know what we're

1309
02:07:28.08 --> 02:07:36.32
dealing with. And yeah, as you can imagine, the pushback I got was was, you know, pretty strong

1310
02:07:36.32 --> 02:07:40.24
from the guys because they're thinking we're giving up this tackle advantage. We should

1311
02:07:40.24 --> 02:07:46.40
explicitly breach every time. And I was getting pressure from my boss. And what I realized is

1312
02:07:47.36 --> 02:07:52.72
if it makes sense to explosively breach, awesome, we will do it. And I told my boss, if it makes

1313
02:07:52.72 --> 02:07:56.80
sense for us to explosively breach, we're going to do it. And if we don't need to, we won't. And if

1314
02:07:56.80 --> 02:08:01.44
we call out as appropriate, we call it as appropriate. So right there's three courses of action,

1315
02:08:01.44 --> 02:08:05.20
which for the first few months I was there, there was one course of action. And how long

1316
02:08:05.20 --> 02:08:09.76
it's to take the enemy to figure that out. And like you're saying, by what was this? Now this

1317
02:08:09.76 --> 02:08:15.68
is 07 of course they'd figured out, oh, we can put a barricaded sandbagged position to room's

1318
02:08:15.68 --> 02:08:21.76
deep, you know, on the main breach point. And we'll have a field day. Yeah, it was their M.O.

1319
02:08:21.76 --> 02:08:30.24
I mean, look, guys often think about warfare and they think the opposing side is, are these

1320
02:08:30.24 --> 02:08:35.76
shadows and these entities and these paper targets. These are creative human beings who aren't

1321
02:08:35.76 --> 02:08:41.76
conform to convention. They don't have doctrinal time hacks and requirements that they have

1322
02:08:41.76 --> 02:08:46.64
to abide by. They wake up, they use their imagination. And sometimes that imagination trumps

1323
02:08:46.64 --> 02:08:53.76
the fighting force conventional tactic that you bring to bear and you got to adapt. You got to be

1324
02:08:53.76 --> 02:08:57.92
malleable. Yeah, I mean, even the idea of what we ended up calling combat clearance. And I don't

1325
02:08:57.92 --> 02:09:01.36
know if you guys call the combat clearance, but like, hey, we're going to open the door and we're

1326
02:09:01.36 --> 02:09:07.20
going to look inside. Like, hey, I'm not why would I run in there? Yeah. And are there times

1327
02:09:07.20 --> 02:09:10.08
you got to run in there? Absolutely. We're getting shot at in the hallway. I'm going to get into

1328
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:12.32
this room. We're getting shot out in the street. We're going to bust this door and we're going to

1329
02:09:12.32 --> 02:09:16.08
get in this building. That's what's going to happen. But if we're safe in the street and it's

1330
02:09:16.08 --> 02:09:20.88
secure and we open this door, oh, we breach the store. What do we run in for there? What do we

1331
02:09:20.88 --> 02:09:26.000
run in? Why? Why would we do that? So again, that was another thing that was contrary to everything

1332
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.60
that not everything I had learned. But to the bulk of what I had learned, which is, hey,

1333
02:09:31.60 --> 02:09:36.64
speed, violence of action. Like, we're going to get, when that door opens, we're going in. And

1334
02:09:36.64 --> 02:09:42.16
I get it. There's plenty of times where that's the appropriate behavior. Absolutely. There's

1335
02:09:42.16 --> 02:09:46.80
also times where that's not the appropriate behavior. And it's difficult to overcome what you

1336
02:09:46.80 --> 02:09:53.68
always feel like what you learn is what you kind of prefer. Right? Whatever you learn first,

1337
02:09:53.68 --> 02:09:57.68
whatever methodology you learn when you're a new guy, you think that's the way it is. And it can

1338
02:09:57.68 --> 02:10:01.84
be hard to overcome that barrier. And there's a bias. There's an actual bias around that. I

1339
02:10:01.84 --> 02:10:06.16
forget what the name of the bias, but there's a cognitive bias around whatever, oh, anchoring.

1340
02:10:06.16 --> 02:10:09.60
So whatever you learn first, whatever piece of information you get first, that's kind of what you

1341
02:10:09.60 --> 02:10:14.40
anchor to. Yeah. So it can be difficult to overcome and say, hey, wait a second, does this really

1342
02:10:14.40 --> 02:10:20.40
make sense? And believe me, I mean, I met that stiff resistance with a lot of guys along the way.

1343
02:10:20.40 --> 02:10:25.44
And what I try not to do was be like, you don't know where this does, I'd be like, okay, well,

1344
02:10:25.44 --> 02:10:30.000
let's talk through it. You know, and actually, I'll tell you what, let's break out some semi-nation.

1345
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.56
And let's give it a shot. Why don't you show me how it works out when you go rushing into this room

1346
02:10:35.76 --> 02:10:38.24
when you don't know what's in there. And there's no reason to rush in there.

1347
02:10:38.24 --> 02:10:41.28
Look if you're getting shot out of the hallway, I get it. But if you're not,

1348
02:10:42.48 --> 02:10:45.84
man, what are we doing? Yeah. Yeah. Don't be in a rush to die.

1349
02:10:49.20 --> 02:10:55.92
So that was a freaking savage deployment then it was epic. And once again, what's you, you knew it

1350
02:10:55.92 --> 02:11:00.72
at the time. I mean, every time every night you're loaded up for it's gone, you're, this is

1351
02:11:00.72 --> 02:11:07.20
good as it's ever going to get. Yeah. I had multiple conversations with the guys in the team room

1352
02:11:07.20 --> 02:11:12.32
in the kit room, getting loaded out like it doesn't get any better than this guys. Remember every

1353
02:11:12.32 --> 02:11:18.88
single moment of this because you'll never get this again. How old were you? 26, 7. Yeah. But that's

1354
02:11:18.88 --> 02:11:24.80
just a little bit your third deployment though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you got to relish it. I was

1355
02:11:24.80 --> 02:11:32.64
comfortable and more. That was, that was, I was getting, I was fixing mistakes. I was making

1356
02:11:32.64 --> 02:11:41.04
and honing this craft and I was getting pretty good at it. And you know, there was opportunities

1357
02:11:42.08 --> 02:11:49.92
inside of my unit to do whatever I wanted to do. And I took all those opportunities. And it was,

1358
02:11:49.92 --> 02:11:56.48
it was a great playing field for creativity. And we did a lot of cool stuff, man. It was, it was amazing.

1359
02:11:56.48 --> 02:12:04.16
It was that task force, crystal, little task force was awesome. Colonel or sort of major,

1360
02:12:04.16 --> 02:12:10.72
Command Sergeant Major NACI was the unit Sergeant Major at the time. And I remember we had a team patch

1361
02:12:10.72 --> 02:12:19.04
and a brief. And our team patch had some skulls on it. And it was like one of those,

1362
02:12:19.04 --> 02:12:27.12
you know, badass like, Punisher school deals, right? And I'm thinking, Sergeant Major NACI's

1363
02:12:27.12 --> 02:12:30.48
going to see this and he's going to be pissed. So during a brief, we're doing a brief

1364
02:12:30.48 --> 02:12:34.88
up before loaded helicopter is saying, looks at it. And I see him side eye, one of the patches.

1365
02:12:35.52 --> 02:12:41.04
And the patch says killed them all on the patch. And he kind of side eyes it. And I'm like, oh,

1366
02:12:41.04 --> 02:12:46.64
shit. And I go to a, my, my cell line of my Jason dude, he's side eye and the patch was screwed.

1367
02:12:46.64 --> 02:12:55.04
And this is the unit Sergeant Major. And so he, he comes over and he says, hey, who's, who's

1368
02:12:55.04 --> 02:12:59.28
patches are these? And Jason steps forward. And he pulls them in the hall. He's coming with me.

1369
02:13:00.32 --> 02:13:04.24
And he goes, so let me see that patch. And he pulls it off his shoulder. And I see this go

1370
02:13:04.24 --> 02:13:09.28
down in the hallway. I'm like, oh, dude, this dude is like Jason's going home. Like we're not doing this

1371
02:13:09.28 --> 02:13:17.60
up. And he hands in the patch and, so our major reaches inside of his pocket and pulls out a handful

1372
02:13:17.60 --> 02:13:24.88
of J-SOT coins that say, uh, task force and has all the numbers. It's a skull. And the backside

1373
02:13:24.88 --> 02:13:30.08
it says, uh, something like operating at the speed of war. And he hands in the coins. He goes,

1374
02:13:30.08 --> 02:13:35.44
it's the coolest patch of earths. And he slaps it on his arm. And he walks out on my dad

1375
02:13:35.44 --> 02:13:39.44
did not go the way up. That's going to go. I was like, we're in the right place. This is, this is where

1376
02:13:39.44 --> 02:13:48.64
it's at right now. Yeah. And this is where, this is where you lose people. I mean, mentally

1377
02:13:48.64 --> 02:13:56.88
lose people. Yeah. Because if you, if you, if you, if you, if you don't know what we're talking

1378
02:13:56.88 --> 02:14:07.52
about, if this sounds like a hyper aggressive or crazy or whatever, what you're forgetting is that

1379
02:14:07.52 --> 02:14:13.84
the whole object of wars to kill the bad guys, that's what we're doing. That's the purpose. I remember

1380
02:14:13.84 --> 02:14:20.40
I heard a story. They were, you know, I read some new story. And it was, I think it was a marine unit.

1381
02:14:20.40 --> 02:14:27.60
And they were talking about the fact that this marine unit had, um, like a scoreboard on the wall of

1382
02:14:27.60 --> 02:14:32.88
number of bad guys killed. And each one of them was like a K-bar. Like a little K-bar was drawn up there.

1383
02:14:32.88 --> 02:14:40.48
And the tone of this article was, you know, just just disturbed by this. So can you believe that

1384
02:14:40.48 --> 02:14:44.96
this is, you, US Marine Corps unit? And I think it's Marine Corps unit. We'll have these, you know,

1385
02:14:44.96 --> 02:14:52.000
it's keeping score of the number of enemy that they killed and proudly display the K-bar knife. And

1386
02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.88
I was just thinking, man, what, what do you think we're human over there? Yeah. What do you think we're

1387
02:14:56.88 --> 02:15:03.12
doing over there? Now, where you got to be careful is, is, well, for one thing, you got to be careful

1388
02:15:03.12 --> 02:15:06.96
because you got to, you got to protect your guys. And if you get them in that mindset, they can go too far

1389
02:15:06.96 --> 02:15:12.32
with it. Of course, you've also got to be careful because you're not building good relations with

1390
02:15:12.32 --> 02:15:20.96
civilians or reporters or the public, at least part of the public because part of the public goes,

1391
02:15:20.96 --> 02:15:27.12
what are you doing? What do you mean kill them all? So it's a, it's a touchy thing to touchy subject.

1392
02:15:27.92 --> 02:15:34.32
And yet the, the entire purpose of a military unit is to kill the bad guys. And man, I said this

1393
02:15:34.32 --> 02:15:39.28
the other day somewhere and people were like freaking out about it. And, and I'm like, well, no,

1394
02:15:39.28 --> 02:15:44.48
I mean, I understand you've got supply people, but we're little supply people supply. There's supply

1395
02:15:44.48 --> 02:15:49.28
bullets so that the frontline guys get, what about the people that are, you know, collecting intelligence,

1396
02:15:49.28 --> 02:15:53.12
whether collecting intelligence, so the frontline guys can go kill people like everyone, that's what we're here for.

1397
02:15:53.92 --> 02:15:59.36
That's what we're here for. There's no other thing and ensure are there humanitarian missions? Yes,

1398
02:15:59.36 --> 02:16:04.72
are we going to try and win hearts and minds? Yes, all those things, all those things are secondary,

1399
02:16:04.72 --> 02:16:09.92
the fact that the military, the military is to kill bad guys. Are they here to protect and defend? Yes,

1400
02:16:09.92 --> 02:16:18.40
absolutely. How do they protect and defend? Kill bad guys. That's it. So you wrap up that

1401
02:16:18.40 --> 02:16:24.24
deployment. Wrap up that deployment and then, uh, start doing advanced training. I mean, I have a lot

1402
02:16:24.24 --> 02:16:28.40
of catching up to do so, um, because you don't have four back to back to back to back to the

1403
02:16:28.40 --> 02:16:36.08
deployments. Yes. Yeah. And every break every month or every day of break is getting more honoured,

1404
02:16:36.08 --> 02:16:42.48
you know, like you need to get more trained. Um, I think that year in between those rotations,

1405
02:16:43.28 --> 02:16:50.40
I went to Cyberschool, I went to FreeFall School, I went to JTAC School, um, all to, again,

1406
02:16:50.40 --> 02:16:54.48
become an asset, more of an asset on my team. So I went to Special Forces, Cyberschool.

1407
02:16:54.48 --> 02:17:00.24
Of course, how long is the Special Forces Cyberschool? A couple months. It's pretty long. I think it's

1408
02:17:00.24 --> 02:17:05.52
two and a half months. A little bit of technical, uh, a lot of tactical, a lot of long gun,

1409
02:17:07.04 --> 02:17:10.88
but it's evolved over time. Um, Rangers go to that same school,

1410
02:17:11.12 --> 02:17:15.20
Cax, and I appreciate that same school, and Special Forces Cyberschool, that school as well.

1411
02:17:16.88 --> 02:17:22.24
Great experience. Learned a lot. I think I got to those out of that break. What I learned most

1412
02:17:22.24 --> 02:17:28.24
was the difficulty of close air support. I was one of the few guys that got picked up and

1413
02:17:28.24 --> 02:17:33.52
tasked to go to school, and I'm like, I'm going to so tack with SoTAC, and the Special Operations

1414
02:17:33.52 --> 02:17:37.76
Terminal Air Control School, I'm like, dude, I want to go to SoTAC. I'm like, look, if you're a

1415
02:17:37.76 --> 02:17:45.04
sniper and you're doing sniper operations, you want to keep the team small, somebody has to have

1416
02:17:45.04 --> 02:17:49.44
that skill set. So you can drop bombs. I'm like, well, that makes sense. All right, does that mean

1417
02:17:49.44 --> 02:17:54.48
I'm tethered to a radio likely, but it means you'll kill more bad guys. I'm all about that. So they sent

1418
02:17:54.48 --> 02:17:58.56
me to one of the most difficult schools I've been to a SoTAC by the way. How long is that school?

1419
02:17:58.56 --> 02:18:03.84
Uh, a few weeks. I think three weeks, two couple weeks of ground, and then an air week where you

1420
02:18:03.84 --> 02:18:10.32
call lifefire, and uh, all different aircraft and platforms. All the, uh, only school I've almost failed.

1421
02:18:10.32 --> 02:18:16.32
Really? I was, I was, I was worried about it. The technical aspects of speaking big,

1422
02:18:16.32 --> 02:18:23.84
military language, like, lat long. I mean, I could speak M. G. R. S. and Braille. Like, I'm good at M. G. R. S.

1423
02:18:23.84 --> 02:18:29.52
But then they said, lat long. I'm like, what the hell is lat long? So, so the Air Force controllers

1424
02:18:29.52 --> 02:18:34.24
that I went to, they're like, you don't know what lat long I'm like, dude, I've never even heard the

1425
02:18:34.24 --> 02:18:38.96
term. Like, what's lat long? Like, I have to learn this. Like, it's all that long, because you have to

1426
02:18:38.96 --> 02:18:44.08
communicate to the aviators. And they speak lat long. Like, oh, no. And so I was, you know, doing the home

1427
02:18:44.08 --> 02:18:50.32
work late at night. I was a senior E7. I was a class leader. And I was played running. I almost failed

1428
02:18:50.32 --> 02:18:55.12
that course. So I was this close. And I think the Air Force dudes there, they would, it didn't

1429
02:18:55.12 --> 02:19:00.32
want to see me pass. They, they were a little stout. They're like, oh, the senior SF guy, the

1430
02:19:00.32 --> 02:19:04.96
students don't. He's played running. They have savages for, yeah, they wanted to see me fail out.

1431
02:19:04.96 --> 02:19:10.80
I passed out. And I got my air, uh, close air support certification. And then a rotated back

1432
02:19:10.80 --> 02:19:17.84
into O8, another war. And what are you doing this last, last time in O8? So O8, um, I was a troop advisor

1433
02:19:17.84 --> 02:19:25.68
for the ICTF. Uh, the Iraqi counterterrorism force was born and bred by the SIF companies, A15,

1434
02:19:26.88 --> 02:19:32.64
and B23, uh, fifth group, uh, SIF and third group SIF pulled these guys into Jordan,

1435
02:19:33.28 --> 02:19:40.24
isolated them, trained them, and then infiltrated back into the country, smashing bad guys. And the ICTF,

1436
02:19:40.24 --> 02:19:49.12
the young operators of the ICTF, they don't get bricks. They don't get a, uh, a red cycle, right?

1437
02:19:49.12 --> 02:19:54.72
They, they stay in warfare and they, through the common of years of war, we got the most

1438
02:19:54.72 --> 02:19:59.68
experience and we're some of the most experienced operators I've ever served with. So I advised

1439
02:19:59.68 --> 02:20:07.92
the whole troop, and at the time we were downsizing American forces. So me, a Navy EOD guy, a Kamo guy,

1440
02:20:07.92 --> 02:20:16.000
maybe Kamo guy, and then a troop full of ICTF, Spinka targets. So what time of, in 2008, were you there?

1441
02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Well, the entire, the entire summer, so probably March, April, timeframe until, you know,

1442
02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:29.76
six months into it, almost a Christmas. And this is smash in targets. All, we are calling them true

1443
02:20:29.76 --> 02:20:34.000
bilateral operations, right? And we're trying to work ourselves out of a job. A lot of guys

1444
02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:40.000
were bummed out by it. Um, things were getting political in08. Uh, I was signing shooter statements.

1445
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.56
If I was admitting that I was killing bad guys, which we start stop doing. I mean, we stop in

1446
02:20:44.56 --> 02:20:49.12
meeting, we were killing bad guys because at that time, if you killed a guy, you were a shooter

1447
02:20:49.12 --> 02:20:56.88
statement and it went to the DOJ and I rack. Uh, I actually remember one time I came back from an

1448
02:20:56.88 --> 02:21:01.52
op and my commander, my company commander comes to me goes, hey Mike, you're good to go back out

1449
02:21:01.52 --> 02:21:07.52
on op's. I was like, I just got back from an op. Sir, what are you talking about? Oh, you,

1450
02:21:07.52 --> 02:21:13.04
you're being investigated for that last shooting yet. I'm like, what? What would you mean

1451
02:21:13.04 --> 02:21:17.12
investigated? Like, well, yeah, they had to do a trial process and they took it to trial. They

1452
02:21:17.12 --> 02:21:21.92
did the shooter statement with witnesses and everything else and then you're good. I'm like, what?

1453
02:21:22.56 --> 02:21:26.48
I don't want to my team star and I'm like, dude, what is going on? They're, we're going on

1454
02:21:26.48 --> 02:21:32.64
trial and through paperwork and then we're shut down from operations. He's like, yeah, it's part of

1455
02:21:32.64 --> 02:21:39.04
the climate. I'm like, uh, and it's, it's, it's one of the first times in, in, in, in leading because

1456
02:21:39.04 --> 02:21:46.72
I was leading a troop, uh, entire troop of ICTF that I started getting affected by the political

1457
02:21:46.72 --> 02:21:52.08
climate. All the other times I've been insulated by cell leaders team sergeants, good leadership

1458
02:21:52.08 --> 02:21:58.16
who knew that they just keep all that shit away from the guys and let them do their job. And

1459
02:21:58.16 --> 02:22:03.20
it's the first time it started trickling down and I'm like, oh, a wow. Yeah. Yeah. The house thinking

1460
02:22:03.20 --> 02:22:07.12
about that when you're talking about your OSF and deployment, I mean, your, your focus was

1461
02:22:07.12 --> 02:22:13.92
100% on your job. That's it. And so the people above you and Jane and Cran, and that's a,

1462
02:22:13.92 --> 02:22:22.000
that was a superlative supportive chain of command as well. Yeah. And so you weren't dealing with

1463
02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:26.16
any of this other crap. No, I'm shutting you up and oh, eight. And you find out you're under

1464
02:22:26.16 --> 02:22:33.76
investing. Super political. Yeah. Super political. So did you, uh, you just kept doing ops

1465
02:22:33.76 --> 02:22:38.000
backed off a little bit. Did you back off a little bit or did you, so the ops weren't as

1466
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.68
aggressive. Like I remember telling my new guys because I was selling it at the time in a troop

1467
02:22:41.68 --> 02:22:47.20
advisor. I remember telling my new, siff guys, bro, it's about to be on. Get your stuff ready,

1468
02:22:47.20 --> 02:22:53.04
bring the thumper plenty of 40 my mic, we're about to kill some bad guys. And go, and we went

1469
02:22:53.04 --> 02:22:57.28
in the solder city and it was crickets. And I'm like, this isn't normal. I was like, dude, it's

1470
02:22:57.28 --> 02:23:02.88
gonna happen. Yeah, I'm bushed. EFT's nothing. And I'm like, what is good? We got back. I'm like,

1471
02:23:02.88 --> 02:23:08.08
no, that that was probably just random. We're, we're gonna get back into it and we're gonna go

1472
02:23:08.08 --> 02:23:12.64
kill. But, and they, they, we get went out again and I'm like, there's nothing happened. What is

1473
02:23:12.64 --> 02:23:20.32
going on? And because of the, at the times, the Sunnis and the Shia's were doing a ceasefire.

1474
02:23:21.04 --> 02:23:26.96
And anytime they killed Americans, they would pay for it politically. They started pulling back

1475
02:23:26.96 --> 02:23:33.60
and just isolating, building their, their infrastructure and their castles and not do not

1476
02:23:33.60 --> 02:23:39.04
be an aggressive. But all the things that we were hit were dry holes. We, we got in a few gunfights,

1477
02:23:39.04 --> 02:23:44.24
killed a few dudes. But it was, it was not what I expected it to be. And it was the transition of

1478
02:23:44.80 --> 02:23:51.92
what became, I think the transition out of that, that fight. Yeah, no, and one of my buddies

1479
02:23:51.92 --> 02:23:57.12
took over my task unit and went into solder city with snipers in, I want to say it was

1480
02:23:58.24 --> 02:24:04.96
June of 08. Yeah. And they killed all kinds of bad guys. And I did about four to six weeks of operations

1481
02:24:04.96 --> 02:24:11.84
there and the freaking, the shakes there kind of like, all right, we're good. We're good. We don't,

1482
02:24:11.84 --> 02:24:16.96
we don't need any more of this. Yeah. And they made that truse and stuff. Yeah. And you know,

1483
02:24:16.96 --> 02:24:22.48
the way I looked at it was like, they'd been doing operations for so long. Like the, the, the, the,

1484
02:24:22.48 --> 02:24:27.04
the, the, the, the, the body army and stuff out of solder city. And they would take so few casualties.

1485
02:24:27.04 --> 02:24:32.56
Yeah. I mean, they go out, set off in the F. P. killed an American or two or what, you know,

1486
02:24:32.56 --> 02:24:38.88
go, go, lob, and like I said, they don't really have to, they don't have to win every time. Like

1487
02:24:38.88 --> 02:24:42.40
it doesn't matter. They're going to go back and they'll attack again tomorrow night or the next night.

1488
02:24:43.12 --> 02:24:48.000
And, but then once they started taking some massive casualties, yeah, we're like, I think we've had enough

1489
02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.72
for this. Yeah, it was pretty much, I remember that time period, um, so I was a sniper at the time.

1490
02:24:52.72 --> 02:25:00.000
So in between my troop at being up, I did stay behind sniper operations. And we actually took

1491
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.76
from what I understand, we took one of the missions that you guys had. You guys were doing daylight

1492
02:25:06.88 --> 02:25:11.76
Overwatch for the guys who were building the T-bearious around solder city. And you guys killed a whole

1493
02:25:11.76 --> 02:25:16.88
bunch of people. When we came in, they switched it to night ops. And we couldn't kill anybody. Like,

1494
02:25:16.88 --> 02:25:21.68
I sat on rooftop for like days and weeks going, where they held all the back guys and, and

1495
02:25:21.68 --> 02:25:25.76
guys were talking like the Navy killed them all. Like, where are they, they're like, they're not coming

1496
02:25:25.76 --> 02:25:32.000
out. They all gave up. There, if once you did reverse ops, uh, that tactic worked because they were

1497
02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:37.36
getting smoked in daylight. And so I, and I think Chris Kyle at one point had that up. And, um, so

1498
02:25:37.36 --> 02:25:42.16
I remember, we remember hearing about his name and some of the guys and like, oh, do they have a

1499
02:25:42.16 --> 02:25:46.88
high body count? We were so excited. And we end filled day one. I was like, crickets and I'm like,

1500
02:25:46.88 --> 02:25:51.76
what is, and they had a, they had a drone. I remember seeing a drone overhead. And they were

1501
02:25:51.76 --> 02:25:56.24
low-flying this drone during the building of this wall and the completion of it. I'm like,

1502
02:25:56.24 --> 02:26:01.36
no wonder there's no bad. Like, all the bad guys here, this drone on purpose, uh, as a tactic

1503
02:26:01.36 --> 02:26:05.36
that we applied, but they're all keeping their head down. And we couldn't kill any of them. And I was

1504
02:26:05.36 --> 02:26:10.80
like, oh, this sucks. But the, the stay behind stuff was fun. Yeah, that, that was a big kind of

1505
02:26:10.80 --> 02:26:15.60
of, uh, whatnot. When I was in Ramadies, the same thing, like the bad guys were, they knew not

1506
02:26:15.60 --> 02:26:22.32
to come out at night. Now, yeah, 90, whatever, probably 97% of the bad guys that got killed by my

1507
02:26:22.32 --> 02:26:26.64
task, and it, one of the daytime. Yeah. The other 3% were at night, because they knew if they came

1508
02:26:26.64 --> 02:26:32.32
out at night, it was a bad deal for them. Free fire. So they came out the day. And it's the same

1509
02:26:32.32 --> 02:26:40.000
thing that those guys didn't saw their city. Um, that's another, so it's another deployment

1510
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.84
another six months, this six months. Yeah. And just going out hitting targets, but it's definitely

1511
02:26:45.84 --> 02:26:51.76
more melow on this deployment. Yeah, it was more of a, uh, a leadership role in troop advising

1512
02:26:51.76 --> 02:26:56.88
the surmager, because I was acting as the ground force commander for every op. So I, I started learning

1513
02:26:57.92 --> 02:27:02.80
a lot about processes. You know, like before I was just in a nougat altar, I was called a ghost

1514
02:27:02.80 --> 02:27:08.40
assaulter, just there doing my little narrow piece of the pie. Now I had to step back and get the

1515
02:27:08.40 --> 02:27:14.24
big picture. I had a control way to assets. I had to flex the different targets. I had a strategize

1516
02:27:14.24 --> 02:27:19.84
on the fly with my troops aren't major deploying his troops. And we had a whole bunch of incidents

1517
02:27:19.84 --> 02:27:25.36
like we're, you know, me and the EOD guy, the Navy EOD guy, are hitting targets by herself,

1518
02:27:25.36 --> 02:27:29.92
because they're hitting a building. We get intel. I don't have enough time to flex that whole

1519
02:27:29.92 --> 02:27:35.76
troop. We have to do it. So we go inside a house as by herself. And it was fun, man. We had a blast.

1520
02:27:35.76 --> 02:27:41.84
It was like it was cool because we had the leash off. And even though it wasn't as active, I mean,

1521
02:27:41.84 --> 02:27:46.64
we were doing, I remember we had an intel from a soccer field that they had a couple handsets that

1522
02:27:46.64 --> 02:27:50.96
correlated to the soccer field. And I was like, all right, we got to get the soccer field. So I said,

1523
02:27:50.96 --> 02:27:54.72
hey, guys, we're going to move to the soccer field. So we started walking. I'm like, I need you guys

1524
02:27:54.72 --> 02:27:59.68
to move out. And they wouldn't move out. I grabbed the EOD guy. We sprinted to the soccer field.

1525
02:27:59.68 --> 02:28:06.000
As we ran around the block, we were in ambient street light. The group of guys were meeting and

1526
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.08
they were in the middle of the soccer field, the middle of night, like two in the morning. They see us.

1527
02:28:10.08 --> 02:28:15.20
And we're sprinting across an overfield, trying to shoot like 10 dudes who move in 10 different

1528
02:28:15.20 --> 02:28:21.04
directions. And we miss everybody. And when we get back the, everybody in the jock and the talk is

1529
02:28:21.04 --> 02:28:25.60
laughing, because they're like, dude, that was the best we've ever seen. Because we saw you guys

1530
02:28:25.60 --> 02:28:29.92
break contact from the main element and you're like screw it and you start sprinting. But they all

1531
02:28:29.92 --> 02:28:34.48
went 10 different directions. So we could track any of them. And we're running and shooting. And we're

1532
02:28:34.48 --> 02:28:38.56
standing there in the field like damn it. That was our opportunity. It was a good time, Sner.

1533
02:28:41.28 --> 02:28:47.92
Wrap up that deployment. Then what's next? So I, I, I get back and I go to Cag and I'm in Cag

1534
02:28:47.92 --> 02:28:55.44
and a, a technical role reconnaissance role. And I go back to Iraq and to Belad. And I, I, I run

1535
02:28:55.44 --> 02:29:02.48
because of my reconnaissance background, it's how I got recruited in. I run a joint interagency task force

1536
02:29:02.48 --> 02:29:10.24
of, um, interagency organizations with J. Sock to do reconnaissance over the entire country of Iraq.

1537
02:29:11.04 --> 02:29:17.52
I was, I was undercover as a lieutenant colonel. So I was an OIC, young OIC. Nobody believed it.

1538
02:29:17.52 --> 02:29:25.04
Um, but put it in that position to C2 and control all the things that were going on for

1539
02:29:25.04 --> 02:29:30.80
reconnaissance assets in the country. Now in Belad at that time period, because everything was

1540
02:29:31.44 --> 02:29:36.08
downsizing and including the base of Belad. A year is this now? Oh, nine. Yeah. So stuff's

1541
02:29:36.08 --> 02:29:40.72
really slowing down. Really slowing down. In fact, the reason they brought me in is because

1542
02:29:40.72 --> 02:29:47.60
reconnaissance is obviously another way we get involved without involving packs on the ground,

1543
02:29:47.60 --> 02:29:54.000
people on the ground. So we still had a, have eyes on, but we had to use technical means of reconnaissance

1544
02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:00.000
and that just depend on dudes and hide sites. In fact, during that time period, um, there was

1545
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.72
a restriction of one of two Americans per target and you had to stay in containment. So if you're

1546
02:30:04.72 --> 02:30:09.44
moving to a bad guy place, you leave behind the Americans, they'd stay on containment with the

1547
02:30:09.44 --> 02:30:15.92
vehicles, um, indigenous force would hit the objective, come back and then you roll out. And so at that

1548
02:30:15.92 --> 02:30:21.04
time, working in the joint interagency, I didn't feel like I was missing out on much. I felt like I had a

1549
02:30:21.04 --> 02:30:27.36
broader role to fill in that capacity. And then, and you're just overseeing all this reconnaissance

1550
02:30:27.36 --> 02:30:34.56
elements. That's what you're saying. All of it. I had daily VTCs with a SILTIM command,

1551
02:30:34.56 --> 02:30:39.76
NAVS OFF, mostly, which was the main effort. Not the way. There wasn't a lot of SF guys in the

1552
02:30:39.76 --> 02:30:45.36
country admit at that time. So I had daily VTCs with a Navy and supported their operations and

1553
02:30:45.36 --> 02:30:50.56
technical reconnaissance means tagging, tracking, locating all the, all the sexy stuff for

1554
02:30:50.56 --> 02:30:56.40
technical recon, um, for the entire country. And that was based on the fact that you had sniper

1555
02:30:56.40 --> 02:31:01.68
experience. Yeah, I got recruited. Con and experience or whatever. Yeah, I got recruited. I want to

1556
02:31:01.68 --> 02:31:07.28
selection or successful. And then, um, my background, my entire life, my background and special

1557
02:31:07.28 --> 02:31:13.36
operations was mapped for that, that field of expertise. In the transition, coming back from

1558
02:31:13.36 --> 02:31:18.40
08 to 09, I went to J. Sox, technical reconnaissance course, which was like six months,

1559
02:31:19.20 --> 02:31:26.48
pretty intense course, and learned a whole new world of operations that I didn't even know existed.

1560
02:31:26.48 --> 02:31:30.80
I knew a little bit, but when I went to that course, I was like, whoa, now this is, this is in

1561
02:31:30.80 --> 02:31:37.76
Koshit. So I did that for Task Force for J. Sox for my own non-rotation. And then what happened after that?

1562
02:31:38.96 --> 02:31:46.08
Gat back and then, um, got with another squadron. And at that time, we had been in Iraq,

1563
02:31:46.64 --> 02:31:51.60
since we killed Zarkawi. The task force has a mid-NiRAC, um, really since, I mean, intermittently,

1564
02:31:53.60 --> 02:32:00.56
we, we own Iraq. But Afghanistan, we completely gave up. So, I wasn't on the ball and Afghanistan,

1565
02:32:00.56 --> 02:32:03.76
because we were too busy in Iraq. And then all of a sudden, we had to change a heart.

1566
02:32:05.28 --> 02:32:12.08
Look, Akhaita was on the run. We didn't even know this thing called ISIS existed. And we decided to do

1567
02:32:12.08 --> 02:32:19.68
a surge as an organization to Afghanistan. And I was on the first thing smoking. So my first

1568
02:32:21.20 --> 02:32:28.40
real good deployment with that organization, with a special mission unit, was in Afghanistan. And

1569
02:32:28.40 --> 02:32:35.12
when we got there, um, the Rangers on the Battle Space, Colonel Carilla was in charge,

1570
02:32:35.84 --> 02:32:41.20
and we were the red headed step-children. And I was like, what? How is an SMU the step-children?

1571
02:32:41.20 --> 02:32:46.56
Like, when I got there, I was taking showers with bottles of water, and it opened field. And I'm like,

1572
02:32:46.56 --> 02:32:51.28
this is the prepare C.T. unit on the planet. And I'm doing this and they're like, dude, we have,

1573
02:32:51.28 --> 02:32:56.72
we're building everything from scratch. So we set up shot there and started targeting bad guys.

1574
02:32:56.72 --> 02:33:02.56
And the first two months was prep. And then the second two months was killing bad guys.

1575
02:33:03.44 --> 02:33:07.92
And we did a lot of it. That, that, that second 60 days of that four-month rotation.

1576
02:33:09.12 --> 02:33:14.08
We saw more bad guys killed in a two-month period than anything that I experienced before.

1577
02:33:14.08 --> 02:33:18.40
You know, it was because of the assets that we brought to bear. Good rotation, though.

1578
02:33:18.40 --> 02:33:23.44
And you were, you were still over seeing Recky at this point? Yeah, I was, I was that squadron's

1579
02:33:23.44 --> 02:33:31.60
reconnaissance in CO, which just specialized in Reckon. So everything from OP's to technical

1580
02:33:31.60 --> 02:33:40.80
Recky to inner agency, like even controlling aircraft for for ISR. And he was an active trip.

1581
02:33:40.80 --> 02:33:47.12
I mean, we lost a dog. We had a guy's shot. We had a guy's blown up. A lot of active operations

1582
02:33:47.12 --> 02:33:54.24
during that period of time. It was, it was amazing to see that talent and you can't really get an

1583
02:33:54.24 --> 02:34:00.16
idea or understanding of that talent and capability when you, when you focus on individuals.

1584
02:34:00.16 --> 02:34:06.40
But when you see it come together in a single combat operation where everybody's so efficient and

1585
02:34:06.40 --> 02:34:13.04
effective, you really see the benefit of the selection process, the training process, and the

1586
02:34:13.04 --> 02:34:17.76
support mechanisms that make that unit the most elite unit in the world.

1587
02:34:19.60 --> 02:34:25.68
Yeah, you know, you hear like the sports analogies of like, well, you know, it's like a professional

1588
02:34:25.68 --> 02:34:31.68
sports scene, but these are like the champions, right? These are the NFL, three can superbow winners.

1589
02:34:31.68 --> 02:34:38.000
That, you know, that you see the superbow guy that like, whatever gets his right arm massaged

1590
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.92
so that he can whatever and he and this other guy's doing speed drills with the first four meters

1591
02:34:43.92 --> 02:34:47.92
of his sprint and he's going to work with a specialist that's going to get him even a little bit,

1592
02:34:47.92 --> 02:34:51.76
you know, one millisecond faster and then they're getting their helmets dialed in so that they

1593
02:34:51.76 --> 02:34:57.68
can have comms in there and they got this, they got all like at just 100% pure focus for every

1594
02:34:57.68 --> 02:35:04.56
individual to be as good as they possibly can. And then you put that team together and every one of

1595
02:35:04.56 --> 02:35:08.88
those individuals is 100% focused on being as good as they possibly can with all the support

1596
02:35:08.88 --> 02:35:13.68
they could possibly want and this is what you end up with just freaking the best.

1597
02:35:13.68 --> 02:35:18.40
Yeah, it's the big leagues for sure. And I, when I realized and that you know, even being a very

1598
02:35:18.40 --> 02:35:26.08
confident shooter, a respected member of special forces and being a PT start at the time,

1599
02:35:26.88 --> 02:35:33.60
that there was men above me and beyond me that I'd never catch up with that were just so talented.

1600
02:35:33.60 --> 02:35:38.40
And I was like, it was humbling and I'm like, well, I'm not the most elite dude. I thought I was.

1601
02:35:38.40 --> 02:35:42.72
I woke up and went, dude, I'm crushing it and then I see the talent pull over there and

1602
02:35:42.72 --> 02:35:49.28
realized there's this thing, this machine. And like you said before, these guys

1603
02:35:50.16 --> 02:35:55.92
aren't trained to be diplomats to be fit experts, the training kill bad guys and they're the best

1604
02:35:55.92 --> 02:36:00.40
at it. I mean, the Navy version and the Army version, they're the best at it in the world.

1605
02:36:00.40 --> 02:36:03.92
And then it was humbling and honorable experience at being part of that.

1606
02:36:06.56 --> 02:36:12.32
So what came after that? So at a very young age, actually at the age of 29, I made

1607
02:36:13.04 --> 02:36:17.92
E8. How's your wife handle it on all this, by the way? She's good. She's a champ at the time.

1608
02:36:17.92 --> 02:36:23.84
I don't, she's never ready to me now. So it's the last. But she's handling it well, man. I mean,

1609
02:36:23.84 --> 02:36:32.08
look, she, her perspective was, if I was happy doing what I loved, that was my moment in time

1610
02:36:32.08 --> 02:36:37.84
and she would support me. Do you have any kids? No kids. No kids. None. So it was easy for us.

1611
02:36:37.84 --> 02:36:44.48
Right? She was busy getting our nursing degree, phenomenal woman, just handling business and grinding.

1612
02:36:44.48 --> 02:36:51.28
And then when I came back, she was my support and make sure, make sure, because you knew I was coming

1613
02:36:51.28 --> 02:36:58.16
back and in that unit, especially those boys don't have any downtime. It doesn't exist. Even when you're

1614
02:36:58.16 --> 02:37:06.000
down, you're not down. You're up on a call cycle for being able to quick respond or you're in a

1615
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.76
down cycle and you're training. You're always gone. I was gone more than any part of my career in

1616
02:37:11.76 --> 02:37:20.16
that organization. So when I made the E8 list, I made it on the black side. There's the black

1617
02:37:20.16 --> 02:37:27.84
list and the black list is just, it's an advertised. And I was just to give, I don't know the exact numbers,

1618
02:37:27.84 --> 02:37:36.000
but for that year, it was something like 160 guys were promoted. I was 159.7 on the black list,

1619
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.56
because the black list, like you're like an intermittent number, that's not advertised. I was the last

1620
02:37:40.56 --> 02:37:46.72
guy on the black side, which includes the Navy that was promoted to E8, which means I was the last

1621
02:37:46.72 --> 02:37:55.68
guy to get picked up and I was 29 years old as an E8. Yeah. And so I, you know, it was mainly because

1622
02:37:55.68 --> 02:38:00.80
of the combat experience I had and then in E7 school, which is for us is called Adenak, I won the

1623
02:38:00.80 --> 02:38:05.92
leadership award. And so those two things set me up to get promoted that fast, but I wasn't prepared

1624
02:38:05.92 --> 02:38:13.52
in my operational career to go, you're an E8. What's next? So if I stayed in that unit, then I

1625
02:38:13.52 --> 02:38:22.32
would have just been what I was, you know, in that unit, you're not, it's called Blue Chips. You don't

1626
02:38:22.32 --> 02:38:27.20
get Blue Chips because you have experience. You could be a 20 year special operations guy. When you

1627
02:38:27.20 --> 02:38:34.08
show up that unit day one, you earn your Blue Chips one day at a time. And so me starting, I would

1628
02:38:34.08 --> 02:38:41.28
starting from zero, leaving the unit and going anywhere I could have gone, I'm a team starting.

1629
02:38:41.28 --> 02:38:47.84
I'm a god in the special operations, right? And it's the job that you want because you're controlling

1630
02:38:48.64 --> 02:38:56.000
and an operating with your ODA with your detachment. I had no, look, I wanted to go back, but I was like,

1631
02:38:56.80 --> 02:39:02.96
if I go back, they'll put me on a regular ODA and not meeting that in a derogatory way,

1632
02:39:02.96 --> 02:39:09.60
but just not a SIF company, not a specialized company. Randomly, gentlemen by the name of Command

1633
02:39:09.60 --> 02:39:15.76
Sergeant Major Bob Erbie, who's a legend in Social Forces Command, communicates to me that he

1634
02:39:15.76 --> 02:39:19.68
hurts. I've heard I may de-eate and he heard about my experience and he wanted to recruit me to

1635
02:39:19.68 --> 02:39:25.36
stand up a new career, a new commander's response force for the, the continent of Africa.

1636
02:39:26.08 --> 02:39:29.60
We didn't have one because we were so busy fighting in the Middle East, we didn't have one.

1637
02:39:30.72 --> 02:39:37.04
Jay Sock approved that and long story short, I stood up a SIF as a plankholder from scratch.

1638
02:39:37.04 --> 02:39:43.28
We went into a company in 10th group, me and another guy from the unit, stood it up from scratch,

1639
02:39:43.28 --> 02:39:51.20
had full power to train anything we wanted to with our guys, reconnaissance guys, and build this unit from

1640
02:39:51.20 --> 02:39:57.20
zero. As we built the unit, we got vetted and validated and then Benghazi kicked off, which

1641
02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:04.000
my or benefit wanted to be in in Africa. So when did you deploy immediately? I deployed immediately.

1642
02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.76
I was the first team to deploy for that unit, two Benghazi, to Libya. This is after the September

1643
02:40:09.76 --> 02:40:17.44
12th of tax. Yeah, September 11 and 12, a tax in 12th in 2012. During our train up,

1644
02:40:18.32 --> 02:40:23.36
we literally get tasked to go to Libya. We start developing intel and then Benghazi kicks off.

1645
02:40:24.08 --> 02:40:29.84
And when that happened, I was actually in a special mission, genic compound, doing cross

1646
02:40:29.84 --> 02:40:36.88
K Ali briefs with Libya and then this thing happens. And then a few weeks later, I'm in Tripoli,

1647
02:40:36.88 --> 02:40:43.20
Libya going building out a counterterrorism force going after Abukutal, the guy responsible for it.

1648
02:40:44.64 --> 02:40:47.04
Did you run it? We didn't run any of those ops though, did we?

1649
02:40:49.52 --> 02:40:58.16
So one, we didn't do anything about it. It was a big 13 hours in Macauze, he was kind of reflective of

1650
02:40:58.16 --> 02:41:05.20
that understanding. But we had the opportunity to kill Abukutala in about 60 to 90 days.

1651
02:41:06.08 --> 02:41:11.36
There are other use of sock elements with us and they positively identified that dude in a short period of time.

1652
02:41:12.08 --> 02:41:16.96
I was there in the meeting when we proposed it to the country team, which included the ambassador

1653
02:41:16.96 --> 02:41:23.12
Sharjay, Alexander Pope, who was appointed and he denied it. He said the political climate

1654
02:41:23.12 --> 02:41:30.72
would allow us to do this. The representative from Yisosak, senior E8, stood up and almost detonated.

1655
02:41:30.72 --> 02:41:36.24
I mean, he detonated in a very tactful way. But that was the climate we were dealing with.

1656
02:41:36.24 --> 02:41:41.68
It was so politically charged, they wouldn't allow us to do anything. For six months, I was in that

1657
02:41:41.68 --> 02:41:47.76
country fighting to kill bad guys, to do our job as to commanders' response force, but also

1658
02:41:47.76 --> 02:41:53.92
representing Yisosak and they wouldn't let us do anything. It was horrible. It was the worst political

1659
02:41:54.56 --> 02:42:01.84
military experience that I faced. So what you're doing, you got home from that.

1660
02:42:01.84 --> 02:42:07.68
That had to leave a bad taste in your mouth. What did? Three weeks after I got back, I was out of the

1661
02:42:07.68 --> 02:42:14.88
army. I dropped my paperwork as a senior E8. With how many years in? The time 16, 16 years.

1662
02:42:14.88 --> 02:42:20.000
When I was down range, I got recruited by the CIA. I was going to take a job called

1663
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:26.56
Pair Military Operations Officer, which is a good-going U.S. or CIA.gov, an apply for my

1664
02:42:26.56 --> 02:42:31.60
exiled job description there. Mike Span was one of the first casualties of the global war

1665
02:42:31.60 --> 02:42:37.04
in terror in September 11th. He was actually a Pair Military Operations Officer. I wanted to be

1666
02:42:37.04 --> 02:42:42.000
Mike Span. I had just finished my college degree, which took me 15 years to accomplish,

1667
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:49.20
which is a prerequisite for government service and federal federal government. And I decided at that

1668
02:42:49.20 --> 02:42:53.84
point, I wanted to step aside and work for this agency because I saw the good things they were

1669
02:42:53.84 --> 02:43:00.48
known. At the time, after I got back in out-processed, very rapidly, where people were like,

1670
02:43:00.48 --> 02:43:07.76
my troop, the main element wasn't even home yet, and I was already out-processed. My independence

1671
02:43:07.76 --> 02:43:14.48
was July 4th of that year of 2013, and immediately started contracting. Went straight back to

1672
02:43:14.48 --> 02:43:22.40
Libya. I was in Libya on terminal leave back in Libya as a civilian, and then started contracting

1673
02:43:22.40 --> 02:43:30.08
with the agency for the next two and a half years. While at the same time, I was in a reserve component

1674
02:43:30.08 --> 02:43:37.76
of special operations, and where I was a team sergeant in Texas. They made sergeant major in Texas.

1675
02:43:38.40 --> 02:43:46.48
And so I was contracting, deploying with an agency, coming home, and then deploying again, deploying again.

1676
02:43:46.48 --> 02:43:52.96
Yeah, put on my uniform, jump on a plane. I mean, one time I came back from Yemen, a week later,

1677
02:43:52.96 --> 02:43:59.36
I was back in the Zira Africa with a sort major uniform on doing a counterterrorism staff operation,

1678
02:43:59.36 --> 02:44:04.48
or staff exercise that turned into an operation. Came back, put on my civilians, and then

1679
02:44:04.48 --> 02:44:10.24
went back to Yemen. So I was just in a cycle of it. Give us a little bit of a brief on what we

1680
02:44:10.24 --> 02:44:18.48
were doing as a what your job was as a contractor. So honestly, it's nothing sexy. I was babysitting

1681
02:44:18.48 --> 02:44:25.20
case officers. I mean, my job was to protect him overseas. I was outside of the, what people would

1682
02:44:25.20 --> 02:44:31.44
normally refer to as industrial contractor. So I actually worked directly for the agency and

1683
02:44:31.44 --> 02:44:36.48
babysat case officers and protected them. When you're a case officer and you come out of school,

1684
02:44:37.68 --> 02:44:46.16
you get a 500 pound head. Lots of experience in training, but it's all concepts. When they go overseas,

1685
02:44:47.04 --> 02:44:53.04
we only have enough time to repair the biggest and brightest minds on the planet to do what they do.

1686
02:44:53.04 --> 02:45:00.80
And so we, we are the, the shield that protects these guys to do their job. And at the time that I

1687
02:45:00.80 --> 02:45:05.44
applaud, you had a minimum experience of six years and special operations, and you had a shoot

1688
02:45:05.44 --> 02:45:12.32
to ask off. And when I showed up for this job, I've vetted, it's a shooting call. You shoot,

1689
02:45:12.32 --> 02:45:18.56
and you beat the standard, or you leave. My class, we had probably 10, 10 dudes that are senior

1690
02:45:18.56 --> 02:45:23.20
level dudes, operators, and the most elite units, half of them probably went home because of the

1691
02:45:23.20 --> 02:45:29.36
shooting calls. You're competing for a six-fear job, also, so the pressure is high. And the shooting

1692
02:45:29.36 --> 02:45:34.48
standards are the, the hardest shooting standards I've seen. Apparently in federal government,

1693
02:45:34.48 --> 02:45:38.64
because you're a federal law enforcement instructor after you get through this experience,

1694
02:45:38.64 --> 02:45:43.60
it's a toughest federal law enforcement call. That's informal. It's not actually doctrine.

1695
02:45:43.60 --> 02:45:52.40
And when I went down range with that organization, I was confident that even me and my

1696
02:45:52.40 --> 02:45:59.76
writing partner, typically were sales that with our little clock 17, P-shooters in the waste band,

1697
02:45:59.76 --> 02:46:04.64
that we could do some work, enough to fight back to our vehicle or back to the machine gun

1698
02:46:04.64 --> 02:46:13.28
in our vehicle and do some work. But it also taught me about what these inter-added season, these

1699
02:46:13.28 --> 02:46:18.88
brave men and women do every day, which is they put it on the line. You don't have a QRF

1700
02:46:20.24 --> 02:46:25.84
Ranger Battalion element in MH47's prepared to come rescue your ass. It's just you.

1701
02:46:26.24 --> 02:46:29.44
And I'm like, dude, you guys do this? Yeah, we've been doing this since the beginning.

1702
02:46:29.44 --> 02:46:35.12
Like, what? This driving around randomly, doing your thing and like, that's all. What's the nearest

1703
02:46:35.12 --> 02:46:41.44
task force? Other but three hours away. Okay, so we're out on our own. That changed everything for

1704
02:46:41.44 --> 02:46:49.76
me. I mean, that changed everything I thought that I potentially knew about single-to-noperations

1705
02:46:49.76 --> 02:46:55.28
and lovis operations. We think lovis, our guy's thought lovis was like putting a shemag on,

1706
02:46:55.28 --> 02:47:00.32
you know, and hiding their chest care or play care underneath their dress, their man dress.

1707
02:47:00.88 --> 02:47:06.72
It's a new game. It's a new game. It was crazy. So you do that for two and a half years?

1708
02:47:06.72 --> 02:47:14.96
Two and a half years. And did you, so you originally wanted to actually be in the CIA, not a contractor?

1709
02:47:16.48 --> 02:47:22.16
You did, where you continued to try and pursue the job of actually being a member?

1710
02:47:22.16 --> 02:47:26.08
Yeah, I wanted to be a staffer. I wanted to be a blue badge or I wanted to be a full-time employee.

1711
02:47:26.80 --> 02:47:32.88
And I had to change a heart when I was in Yemen. Yemen was super political. The Houthis,

1712
02:47:32.88 --> 02:47:38.80
the political climate, and all these things that were transpiring was doing what I didn't

1713
02:47:38.80 --> 02:47:44.24
think was possible in that interagency, which was debilitating their ability to do their job.

1714
02:47:44.24 --> 02:47:53.20
And I saw great guys that were on operational side, on the operational side that were getting stagnated.

1715
02:47:55.20 --> 02:48:00.08
I couldn't believe it. I actually, I remember thinking to myself on one rotation,

1716
02:48:00.64 --> 02:48:05.04
like this doesn't happen to these guys. There's no way. These dudes, there's no way these guys are

1717
02:48:05.04 --> 02:48:11.76
getting. There's got to be something going on. Coconut dagger. And it wasn't because of the oversight

1718
02:48:11.76 --> 02:48:18.32
of how the interagency the IC works in the intelligence community. With well over 17 agencies now,

1719
02:48:19.04 --> 02:48:26.32
there's so much direct, direct, direct national level oversight and micro management

1720
02:48:26.32 --> 02:48:30.88
that can't do their jobs. And so I had my whole thing with the internet on the military was,

1721
02:48:30.88 --> 02:48:36.48
if I can't kill bad guys, I don't belong here. So I left because I went to an organization which I

1722
02:48:36.48 --> 02:48:42.40
thought were still killing bad guys. And they still were in some capacity. But where I was in the

1723
02:48:42.40 --> 02:48:47.84
situation I was in, they weren't. And I went dude, I have to have to change a heart here. I have

1724
02:48:47.84 --> 02:48:53.12
to figure something out because the war for me is over. There's no more killing. I mean, eventually

1725
02:48:53.12 --> 02:48:59.04
ISIS popped their heads up and there was a whole new cycle of killing that I missed, which I wish

1726
02:48:59.04 --> 02:49:05.28
I was part of. But I had to make a decision to get out. And then that was it. That was it.

1727
02:49:05.28 --> 02:49:13.52
I was in Pakistan and I made that decision. I brain stormed. My, my ride partner who was a seal,

1728
02:49:13.52 --> 02:49:18.80
his brother was a dev group guy that was killed on a raid, a rest trying to rescue a hostage in

1729
02:49:18.80 --> 02:49:25.44
Africa. And he's one of my best friends. And I said, hey man, I want to start a business.

1730
02:49:26.24 --> 02:49:30.40
He's like, well, it's brain storm. And we had course of action development, man. We sat down

1731
02:49:30.40 --> 02:49:36.72
after work and mapped out some plans and many conversations over dinner trying to figure out

1732
02:49:36.72 --> 02:49:44.64
like what I could do. And, you know, with our background expertise, the obvious route is a

1733
02:49:44.64 --> 02:49:50.96
tactical something, right? But I didn't want to do that, man. I saw these dudes who were getting out

1734
02:49:50.96 --> 02:49:55.60
and they were dealing with all the backlash of coming out and saying, hey, I'm this guy.

1735
02:49:55.60 --> 02:50:01.20
Because at the time I didn't have any social media. And I'm like, I don't want to be a tactical

1736
02:50:01.20 --> 02:50:08.40
kind of guy. I want to do something kind of different. And I wrote down survival. And, you know,

1737
02:50:08.40 --> 02:50:12.000
primitive survival is what most people would think about. And when they think about survival.

1738
02:50:12.56 --> 02:50:18.16
But I said, what if there's this niche and developing like this modern survival take on preparedness

1739
02:50:18.72 --> 02:50:23.76
of training citizens, not just military and law enforcement, but citizens to be better prepared

1740
02:50:23.76 --> 02:50:28.80
in their culture? What year is this? This is 2015. Damn, so you were ahead of the curve.

1741
02:50:28.80 --> 02:50:34.80
Yeah. Yeah. This is 15. And I'm like, there's something here. And I wrote a mission statement.

1742
02:50:34.80 --> 02:50:40.08
I did a con op. I wrote a whole five-fair graph op order on the whole business plan. And

1743
02:50:41.04 --> 02:50:47.76
resigned from my position with Interatency came home, talked to my command soldier major,

1744
02:50:47.76 --> 02:50:52.40
as a Sergeant Major. I was an op Sergeant Major at the time. I said, hey, man, I'm thinking about

1745
02:50:52.40 --> 02:50:57.92
doing this. Because dude, like, there's nothing going on. It's like we're about to activate the

1746
02:50:57.92 --> 02:51:03.28
entire unit. And you'll be a staff Sergeant Major sitting in a talk for a year and I've got to stand.

1747
02:51:03.28 --> 02:51:09.20
There's nothing going on. Do what you want to do. I said, how hard is it for me to resign?

1748
02:51:09.20 --> 02:51:14.48
Because I will type the paperwork. That's how easy it is. And then I'll just send a team

1749
02:51:14.48 --> 02:51:19.44
and you sign it for your position and your rank. You don't have to do anything. But technically

1750
02:51:19.44 --> 02:51:26.16
resign. And you'll go into IR status, inactive, ready reserved. And that's it. And I remember I did that.

1751
02:51:27.12 --> 02:51:32.64
And the next day I was like, holy crap. Like I just cut the biggest and

1752
02:51:32.64 --> 02:51:39.04
political court known to man in history of man. And now I hear Flavin. And I have to make it

1753
02:51:39.04 --> 02:51:44.80
make sure to happen. And are you still married at this point? I'm not. I'm three years removed.

1754
02:51:44.80 --> 02:51:52.16
Or two years removed from a divorce. But you don't have to take care of anyone but yourself.

1755
02:51:52.16 --> 02:51:57.36
It's just me. So it's kind of like a little bit of big on bell-cocard. But I mean, let's face it.

1756
02:51:57.92 --> 02:52:01.68
You're going to be able to, you know, give me a ground pad.

1757
02:52:02.72 --> 02:52:08.96
Yeah, I'm winging it, man. I'm, I think I probably was living in a ground like a pad.

1758
02:52:08.96 --> 02:52:14.32
I was probably an air mattress in a, a band in place. I was smart with my money because

1759
02:52:14.32 --> 02:52:18.64
they call it the Thousand Air Club because you, you make it in the Thousand a day in your bank

1760
02:52:18.64 --> 02:52:24.48
roller. Most guys go home, blow it on Harley's and trucks and come back and start the vicious cycle again.

1761
02:52:25.44 --> 02:52:29.92
But I took that money. I think it was 25k and invested it and started my business.

1762
02:52:31.20 --> 02:52:37.28
What was the first move? The first move was education. I had no idea. Educating yourself. Educating

1763
02:52:37.28 --> 02:52:43.92
myself. I had no idea about marketing about, um, like I have a degree in Homeland Security. What's

1764
02:52:43.92 --> 02:52:49.76
going to translate to? Now, much in, in my new field of expertise. So I took my business plan,

1765
02:52:50.32 --> 02:52:56.40
started doing, um, trying to build fidelity on the correlation between a concept and then the

1766
02:52:56.40 --> 02:53:01.20
execution of that concept, trying to use historical data. And there was none. There was no good

1767
02:53:01.20 --> 02:53:07.76
case studies or examples of businesses in that genre that weren't very narrow in their field.

1768
02:53:07.76 --> 02:53:11.76
Primed us a rival. Yeah, sure. You can find a hundred business plans. They all suck and they're not

1769
02:53:11.76 --> 02:53:17.60
doing very well. But what is this cultural thing of like this genre of call preparedness? Where mindset,

1770
02:53:17.60 --> 02:53:24.56
self-awareness, uh, technical training, um, you know, all the things that we did in our culture

1771
02:53:24.56 --> 02:53:29.68
and purpose and special operations. How does that translate to citizens? And how do you scale verticals

1772
02:53:29.68 --> 02:53:34.96
in business? That was intense for me. Uh, it's something that I still learned today, you know,

1773
02:53:35.68 --> 02:53:40.08
five years later with 40 plus employees. I'm like, dude, I'm still learning. I'm trying to figure

1774
02:53:40.08 --> 02:53:45.28
in to show you what was the first move that you made then in terms of like what's the first gig that you did?

1775
02:53:45.28 --> 02:53:50.96
So the first gig was a tactical training because I could make a revenue stream. So I'm like,

1776
02:53:50.96 --> 02:53:57.92
wait, I figure out like a 12 to 24 people, $500 to slot, pistol carbine, let's make some revenue.

1777
02:53:57.92 --> 02:54:03.20
Then I built the website. Then I started marketing. Social media for me was brand new. And I think

1778
02:54:03.20 --> 02:54:08.72
at the time was new for people to see special operations guys doing it. I know at the time there's

1779
02:54:08.72 --> 02:54:14.08
only handful of us doing that. And people were like, oh, and they gravitated towards us. I remember

1780
02:54:14.08 --> 02:54:20.80
10 Kennedy, I was his boss. Uh, 10 Kennedy was a, is an MMA fighter, um, um, um, uh, success launch

1781
02:54:20.80 --> 02:54:25.60
of manure. I was his boss at the time and I'm like, dude, how are you doing this? He plugged me on

1782
02:54:25.60 --> 02:54:30.56
his social media. I got 10,000 followers and I'm like, this is how it works. This network building,

1783
02:54:30.56 --> 02:54:38.48
that's how easy it was. And so I started building it. I designed a survival kit. As a contractor,

1784
02:54:38.48 --> 02:54:44.64
I went to, um, the luxury of doing the interagency direct contract position. I can go to any training

1785
02:54:44.64 --> 02:54:48.88
I want to. And they sent me to a whole bunch of high-speed schools, including a survival school,

1786
02:54:49.20 --> 02:54:54.000
where they had high-speed contractors who developed this like Ziplock back theory.

1787
02:54:54.56 --> 02:54:58.24
There's this guy right now who works for a Kevin Estella. He's in the field right now,

1788
02:54:58.24 --> 02:55:03.60
day two, doing a 72 hours Ziplock back challenge on a field cross survival and Instagram. And we're

1789
02:55:03.60 --> 02:55:09.52
updating it. And the idea is, if you're in a foreign country that's semi-promissive, non-promissive,

1790
02:55:10.40 --> 02:55:15.52
the worst case scenario for you is it loses its sovereignty. A coup happens and now you're on your

1791
02:55:15.52 --> 02:55:22.72
own. The first star in the 50s that was applied to the CIA board was a guy who, uh, escaped and

1792
02:55:22.72 --> 02:55:30.000
evaded from China and got killed and Tibet by a random security guy shot in the chest with one

1793
02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:36.88
round with like a 32 British pistol revolver. Um, that's a thing and there's dangerous of it.

1794
02:55:36.88 --> 02:55:41.92
So the idea is like a Ziplock bag is the things that you can carry on your person, your physical body.

1795
02:55:42.56 --> 02:55:47.28
So I took that and I literally in the course went, everything you guys put in this bag,

1796
02:55:47.28 --> 02:55:51.44
how did you guys come up with it? Well, we did R&D, like the best things that we could put in the bag

1797
02:55:51.44 --> 02:55:56.72
and you're going to live out of it for 72 hours, which happens to be, uh, appropriate amount of time

1798
02:55:56.72 --> 02:56:03.60
to escape, evade, um, and then carry the appropriate amount of stuff in reconnaissance, like not

1799
02:56:03.60 --> 02:56:08.48
overbearing. And I said, I'm going to take everything in these bags and I'm going to turn into a

1800
02:56:08.48 --> 02:56:13.12
survival kit and sell it. He's like, dude, you should do that. My valium doing it. And so I,

1801
02:56:13.12 --> 02:56:18.56
our first survival kit, I sold like a thousand on day one of that kit. And I was like,

1802
02:56:19.28 --> 02:56:23.76
there's something here. There's a product thing here. There's a training thing here. There's these

1803
02:56:23.76 --> 02:56:31.28
revenue streams that I'm seeing and we built it from very small diversified and build up all the

1804
02:56:31.28 --> 02:56:37.52
verticals, one by one. So you sell a thousand of these survival kits almost instantly.

1805
02:56:37.52 --> 02:56:43.68
Instantly. So now your theory is correct. There's demand. There is demand. I'm creating a new

1806
02:56:43.68 --> 02:56:49.84
demand signal, but there's demand. Um, that that starts off. What year is that?

1807
02:56:49.84 --> 02:56:58.24
Six, the very beginning of 16, the very beginning of 16. So five years ago, you get the word out.

1808
02:56:58.24 --> 02:57:02.64
You sell a thousand these kits. And so then what's the next move? Now you know there's a market,

1809
02:57:03.20 --> 02:57:07.44
you start developing shit. What's next? Well, I think part of it was I have to develop a

1810
02:57:07.44 --> 02:57:11.60
culture here. Like there's a, there's a thing that exists that I'm trying to redefine.

1811
02:57:12.64 --> 02:57:17.84
Most people who think or have seen us on the surface even think that we're a primitive survival

1812
02:57:17.84 --> 02:57:21.84
company because survival is synonymous with, with primitive survival, like rubbing sticks together

1813
02:57:21.84 --> 02:57:26.48
in the woods. And so I'm not a big fan of that. I'm not an expert at that. There's guys that are

1814
02:57:26.48 --> 02:57:33.68
talented at that. I hire those guys now, but that's not me. I'm the guy who understands that, you know,

1815
02:57:33.68 --> 02:57:39.84
20 operators can go out and deliberately hit the worst-case scenario and come out on top. And so

1816
02:57:39.84 --> 02:57:47.76
in my hypothesis, like, why is that happening? Why do, why do intentionally men put themselves

1817
02:57:47.76 --> 02:57:54.08
in harm's way to kill the bad guy and why statistically do they come out on top? And so if you

1818
02:57:54.08 --> 02:58:00.56
start looking out and laying out all the reasons why, it's not because of one widget, one school,

1819
02:58:00.96 --> 02:58:06.88
it's because the culture that are immersed in. They all got selected together, they train together,

1820
02:58:07.12 --> 02:58:11.68
they pay attention to all the details. They can do contingency based planning. They have service support.

1821
02:58:11.68 --> 02:58:17.68
They do course of action development. They rehearse. They pay attention to their equipment and

1822
02:58:17.68 --> 02:58:23.36
everything they do. And ultimately they're conscious to their culture, their world. They're here

1823
02:58:23.36 --> 02:58:28.56
right now paying attention to what they are doing. And when I look at citizens and everything that's

1824
02:58:28.56 --> 02:58:35.60
happening in a world that we never learned lesson from, we're completely complacent and freedom

1825
02:58:35.60 --> 02:58:42.48
as a benefit of freedom because we're comfortable in routine. And that happens to be our MO as

1826
02:58:42.48 --> 02:58:47.76
Americans, which is beneficial, right? That you live in sovereign societies, you get all the luxuries and

1827
02:58:47.76 --> 02:58:53.60
freedoms of all the man who go off to war and do this thing. But what is it to the detriment?

1828
02:58:53.60 --> 02:58:58.48
Or what's the, if you look at statistics? And this is what I did. This is, this is the greatest

1829
02:58:58.48 --> 02:59:03.44
start point is doing this research. I started realizing there's no understanding of what this even

1830
02:59:03.44 --> 02:59:08.48
means. There's one guy that I found. There's a couple guys, but one guy significantly, by the

1831
02:59:08.48 --> 02:59:14.32
name of John Leach, who did a study on survival psychology. He asked a question, why do people live

1832
02:59:14.32 --> 02:59:20.88
and why do people die? Specifically in catastrophes. He has a theory based on his case study

1833
02:59:20.88 --> 02:59:26.48
analysis of mostly natural disasters. Some of them man made that there's a breakdown of about

1834
02:59:26.48 --> 02:59:33.60
10, 80, 10. 10% of the population happens to be making the right decision and they survive.

1835
02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:40.16
80% probably broken in half, 50, 50. Sometimes the right decision, sometimes the wrong. And then

1836
02:59:40.16 --> 02:59:46.48
10% are the bottom of the barrel. They're like the guy who runs, this is in a survival situation

1837
02:59:46.48 --> 02:59:51.68
of some kind. This is a catastrophe, disaster. So all of the things coming together typically

1838
02:59:51.68 --> 02:59:59.20
associated with compressed timeline and high intensity stress. So the bottom 10% is the bottom of

1839
02:59:59.20 --> 03:00:07.28
the barrel. And children happen to be in that bottom 10%. And so the question is why are some people

1840
03:00:07.28 --> 03:00:12.000
at the top 10 and why are people at the bottom 10? And how do we get the people who are at the bottom?

1841
03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:18.72
Even children into the top 10. And that was the premise of my business and answering that question.

1842
03:00:18.72 --> 03:00:27.44
We need to figure out why people die. What is their background and experience? What mistakes they

1843
03:00:27.44 --> 03:00:33.44
made and how can we put them in a bracket and a 10% bracket to make sure they survive? That was the

1844
03:00:33.44 --> 03:00:38.32
question that had to be answered. That's where it started and then you started looking at, okay,

1845
03:00:39.44 --> 03:00:45.04
what did you find? What did you find as far as a curriculum that you put together that moves people

1846
03:00:45.04 --> 03:00:51.36
from the bottom 10? We're getting killed to the top 10. The most impactful thing that I found,

1847
03:00:51.36 --> 03:00:57.12
which I see a lot of correlation in what your whether it's discovery or just dissemination of your

1848
03:00:57.12 --> 03:01:03.92
books and all the information that you're doing is self-awareness breeds situational awareness.

1849
03:01:04.80 --> 03:01:09.68
So there's this lack of awareness. There's really a lack of understanding. The analogy I like to use

1850
03:01:09.68 --> 03:01:17.12
is to have a land cruiser. I'm a big fan of land cruisers. So I take my land cruiser, which is a 94

1851
03:01:17.12 --> 03:01:23.60
land cruiser, which is FCG80, if your land cruiser nerd, head gasket problems are notorious for these

1852
03:01:23.60 --> 03:01:29.12
things. They overheat their head gasket blows and then it's catastrophic. So the question is,

1853
03:01:29.76 --> 03:01:35.76
when you're driving down the road and you see smoke, how do you address smoke? Most people see smoke

1854
03:01:35.76 --> 03:01:41.52
and they go, oh crap, smoke, let me pull over, right? I'll call Triple A. So they have a dependence

1855
03:01:41.52 --> 03:01:47.60
on something else. An institution, an insurance company, whatever it may be. And so they don't source

1856
03:01:47.60 --> 03:01:53.20
source, the solution. Another course of action is you keep driving because you don't understand

1857
03:01:53.20 --> 03:01:57.76
what's happening. So you just push through and you think that pushing through, hey, because it's

1858
03:01:57.76 --> 03:02:03.68
only 10 minutes away from home is the answer. So you saw the smoke, you didn't have a answer.

1859
03:02:03.68 --> 03:02:09.20
There's a void, a darkness in the back of your head. So you just do something random. It's randomized

1860
03:02:09.20 --> 03:02:14.80
behavior. You drive, you get home and before you get home when you get down in your street,

1861
03:02:15.92 --> 03:02:23.12
your car catastrophically in floats. You hear a pop, you hear noise. It starts the buck,

1862
03:02:23.12 --> 03:02:27.60
you pull it over to side the road, you lift the hood and you realize you have a blown engine.

1863
03:02:27.60 --> 03:02:34.72
Right? That analogy is representative of people's brains and the understanding of the brain.

1864
03:02:34.72 --> 03:02:41.36
So a lot of things that we happen to us in our lives mostly affected by stressors,

1865
03:02:41.36 --> 03:02:46.80
which happens to be a catastrophe, by the way. A stressor is just either low grade or high-grade

1866
03:02:47.20 --> 03:02:53.60
catastrophe. We take stress, we start filling these things and then we don't know how to control it,

1867
03:02:53.60 --> 03:02:59.36
we don't know how to diagnose it, we don't understand mechanical processes and then so we ignore it

1868
03:02:59.36 --> 03:03:06.32
until it becomes catastrophic. So now you're in the vehicle accident and your only role is to do certain

1869
03:03:06.32 --> 03:03:11.36
technical things to help the person who's burning alive, but you don't know how to do it. Why?

1870
03:03:11.36 --> 03:03:18.16
Because you don't understand how to break glass. You don't understand the 42 that's required to

1871
03:03:18.16 --> 03:03:22.88
push past the pain and break glass, or maybe if you understood technically that you could just crack

1872
03:03:22.88 --> 03:03:28.000
off this wire and tin and slap it that you could shadow the glass. Or if you're even had more

1873
03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:32.96
a forethought, maybe carry a tool, like a breaching ass, a wing cler-hape, a breaching ass, and you smash

1874
03:03:32.96 --> 03:03:37.44
the window. But then you let that person burn to the ground. Hopefully it's not a family member.

1875
03:03:37.44 --> 03:03:44.48
Hopefully it's not you. But this happens. And this little thing happens to everybody and some kind

1876
03:03:44.48 --> 03:03:49.20
of circumstance. And what I tell people is if it hasn't happened, it's bound to happen.

1877
03:03:49.20 --> 03:03:55.84
The difference between us and our experiences and civilians is that we've seen the detriment

1878
03:03:55.84 --> 03:04:01.68
of not following these basic processes and the understanding of what take places when you don't

1879
03:04:01.68 --> 03:04:08.88
understand them. So what I want to do is lint these processes and understanding so people can self-diagnose

1880
03:04:09.60 --> 03:04:15.04
be aware of what's happening sympathetically, parasympathetically, and then give them more awareness.

1881
03:04:15.04 --> 03:04:20.16
So when they see smoke, they go, oh that's not smoking all. That's water vapor. That's coming

1882
03:04:20.16 --> 03:04:24.48
from our radiator. Oh I'm going to pull over. I'm going to let the car idle and sit. I'm going

1883
03:04:24.48 --> 03:04:29.36
to let it cool down. Oh I carry gloves and a rag in the back of my car. I'm going to pop the

1884
03:04:29.36 --> 03:04:33.92
radiator cap. Oh I realize because I looked in the reservoir, there's nothing in the reservoir.

1885
03:04:33.92 --> 03:04:38.88
I carry coolant because I have a 94 and it eats coolant. I get coolant put it back in it.

1886
03:04:38.88 --> 03:04:44.16
Top it off, sit it, let it idle. Everything seems fine and I'm on my way and I just survived.

1887
03:04:44.16 --> 03:04:50.56
That whole thing is not done and a very tactful and intelligible way and I think we need to change that.

1888
03:04:51.20 --> 03:04:56.80
So it requires processes, it requires progressive learning, it requires a lot of different paths

1889
03:04:56.80 --> 03:05:02.96
that haven't been created, which is the business challenge because it's easy to articulate it,

1890
03:05:02.96 --> 03:05:08.48
to do a podcast, to do a book, all those things, but to create a progressive path for civilians who are

1891
03:05:08.48 --> 03:05:14.40
disinterested in the first place, it's the best in my opinion business problem to have because it

1892
03:05:14.40 --> 03:05:20.96
lends itself to a new challenge, which I'm all about. So what are the courses look like? How do

1893
03:05:20.96 --> 03:05:26.16
let's say you just sold me and I'm like, hell yeah I'm in the game, I'm freaking,

1894
03:05:26.16 --> 03:05:32.72
uh, jocco the, whatever, insurance salesman and you just sold me. What do I do? There's three

1895
03:05:32.72 --> 03:05:39.04
progressive paths to this. The first path is Phil Graserov, Phil Graserov.com. It's the website.

1896
03:05:39.04 --> 03:05:43.76
It's physical training. It's like physical things that you can do. It's gunfighter pistol,

1897
03:05:43.76 --> 03:05:49.76
gunfighter carbine. It's first a tactical combat casualty care. This is via a website via a website.

1898
03:05:49.76 --> 03:05:55.84
So you're, for instance, on on on a video explaining to me how to put a turn of

1899
03:05:55.84 --> 03:06:01.68
it on my kit. This component is you physically come to our training. Okay so there's a difference.

1900
03:06:01.68 --> 03:06:06.24
So you said website, but then you said physical. So you go on the website. You get you sign up for the

1901
03:06:06.24 --> 03:06:11.04
training, right? And then the, the in person physical training is one component of it.

1902
03:06:11.84 --> 03:06:16.000
Uh, that training includes equipment, augmentation and equipment. Look, we're not the, we don't

1903
03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:20.80
on them, and hopefully on medical gear. But I, I will sell you the best medical gear that's made.

1904
03:06:20.80 --> 03:06:25.28
Uh, North American Rescue, the same cat seven turn of kits or cat turn of kits that we used.

1905
03:06:25.28 --> 03:06:30.08
We've seen them save lives. So we sell turn of kits, survival kits, all the augmentation for

1906
03:06:30.08 --> 03:06:35.20
enabling people to be better prepared. That's the fill cross survival. The second component is

1907
03:06:35.20 --> 03:06:41.04
progressive learning. You have to be able to learn progressively at a start point and understand

1908
03:06:41.04 --> 03:06:46.40
the path. I realize that deficiency years into this whole thing. Because people go, oh, I

1909
03:06:46.40 --> 03:06:51.36
train gunfighter pistol, what's next? And I'm like, uh, gunfighter pistol too. And they're like,

1910
03:06:51.36 --> 03:06:58.24
oh, we'll outside of that, what's next? Like, well, I need a holistic path to this. So we hired a

1911
03:06:58.24 --> 03:07:05.92
girl, um, her name's Amber, stay at home, um, nurse. Somebody who understands LMS systems.

1912
03:07:05.92 --> 03:07:10.40
We actually teamed up with Ozmore, which is a learning management based system. The same thing

1913
03:07:10.40 --> 03:07:16.80
we did with online learning with your masters for my bachelor's, where we take, um, an online

1914
03:07:16.80 --> 03:07:22.64
learning approach to get people involved including families. So you can go online. You could sell

1915
03:07:22.64 --> 03:07:28.000
up, you could sign up on, uh, wetheprepair.com and sign up for an LMS component that includes,

1916
03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:33.92
like, stop the bleed. So you take a class where you receive a turnic it, you apply that turnic it,

1917
03:07:33.92 --> 03:07:38.24
and you have an interactive experience virtually. It's online learning, but it's for the

1918
03:07:38.24 --> 03:07:43.68
preparedness minded. It's for people who, you know, who don't have the time or money to fly

1919
03:07:43.68 --> 03:07:48.96
from North Carolina to Utah to take a physical class in person. So there's a progressive learning

1920
03:07:48.96 --> 03:07:53.52
path that touches all the fields that we break down, what's called tellers of preparedness,

1921
03:07:53.52 --> 03:07:59.28
which I can go over, um, of how we, how we, uh, disseminate this information. So people can

1922
03:07:59.28 --> 03:08:04.48
understand it. The last component to that is what I've realized, uh, that preparedness is,

1923
03:08:04.48 --> 03:08:10.96
is it's this thing that brings people together. That's not super toxic. Like everybody can get,

1924
03:08:10.96 --> 03:08:16.80
if you're a liberal in San Francisco or a conservative and moral Montana, you can get on board

1925
03:08:16.80 --> 03:08:22.000
that you need this idea of preparedness to make you better prepared for the worst case scenario,

1926
03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:28.000
generally speaking. So when I have classes in person or online, I see this community building

1927
03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:33.44
built based off of this one thing that's not segregating people, or that doesn't have toxic,

1928
03:08:34.08 --> 03:08:39.44
underlined things about it, right? It's not French. So we started, uh, American

1929
03:08:39.44 --> 03:08:45.76
contingency, which is a community-based program where if we educate people to be better prepared,

1930
03:08:45.76 --> 03:08:50.64
what's next? What happens when you get around people that you like, because you're,

1931
03:08:50.64 --> 03:08:54.16
you're thinking about the same considerations. Like, I want to take care of my family. I want

1932
03:08:54.16 --> 03:09:00.24
to protect myself. Um, how can you inner operate? Well, there's, like, there's a, there's a,

1933
03:09:00.24 --> 03:09:04.88
there's a bigger picture, right? The breakdown of the family unit, breakdown of, uh, communities.

1934
03:09:05.44 --> 03:09:10.80
When we, me and you grew up, we knew our neighbors. We knew our, our neighbors, friends, and family.

1935
03:09:11.60 --> 03:09:15.76
Now, if you see your neighbor and he's checking us now, you're like, you're like, who's that guy?

1936
03:09:15.76 --> 03:09:19.60
Like, why is he looking at me? Like, that's her neighbor, man. Like, what do you do? Like,

1937
03:09:19.60 --> 03:09:24.40
for the first time in history, you could be in an apartment complex with thousands of people

1938
03:09:24.40 --> 03:09:30.72
in a vertical and not no one person and be disinterested and knowing anybody. But what do you do when

1939
03:09:30.72 --> 03:09:36.56
you have to band together because our hurricane destroyed the infrastructure of your town? Well,

1940
03:09:36.56 --> 03:09:41.84
American contingency, we actually have a members dot American contingency dot com that allows people

1941
03:09:41.84 --> 03:09:47.84
to group and network. We have hundreds of groups that are inner operating now, that are like

1942
03:09:47.84 --> 03:09:54.56
minded, that train together, that work together, that build assets and their capabilities together

1943
03:09:54.56 --> 03:09:59.20
and then the break bread together, which is building relationships. So, and every tier,

1944
03:09:59.92 --> 03:10:07.60
and this just happened, which, um, you know, look, I think the, the most impactful thing that you've

1945
03:10:07.60 --> 03:10:15.44
done in your career and your, in your life is what you're showing in, um, and what you do and your

1946
03:10:15.44 --> 03:10:20.16
actions outside of the military, right? So, it's somebody for me as a young entrepreneur I look

1947
03:10:20.16 --> 03:10:26.56
at you and go, these are the right things, writing a book in publication that exposes your

1948
03:10:26.56 --> 03:10:33.52
ideology and your thinking to impact young people who don't have anything to lean on and purpose

1949
03:10:33.52 --> 03:10:38.48
is the most impactful thing that a human being could do, especially from our backgrounds. So,

1950
03:10:38.48 --> 03:10:42.80
I said, I'm going to do pillars of preparedness, teachers thing, let me get a book deal.

1951
03:10:42.80 --> 03:10:49.84
Well, nobody wants to touch me. For years, they thought I was French. I mean, I've been called

1952
03:10:49.84 --> 03:10:55.84
everything from right-wing extremists, which is bizarre because I'm half Asian, um, to, um, you know,

1953
03:10:55.84 --> 03:11:01.20
neo-nazzi to all this weird stuff because I'm, I'm talking about this idea being prepared.

1954
03:11:03.04 --> 03:11:10.16
Just two weeks ago, I signed a book deal with a major publisher that vetted me for two years,

1955
03:11:10.16 --> 03:11:15.04
which means they just paid attention about writing a book on preparedness. And I'm like,

1956
03:11:16.48 --> 03:11:22.000
that's big, that's huge for me. One to be able to impact somebody via the written word which I

1957
03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:29.84
grew up with is impactful, but to a publisher that published Michelle Obama and also Jordan Peterson,

1958
03:11:29.84 --> 03:11:35.76
on both sides of the spectrum is taking a chance on me. And I am allowed, I'm, I'm, I'm humble

1959
03:11:35.76 --> 03:11:42.000
by the opportunity allowed to have the opportunity to pass this word and mainstream to people

1960
03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.88
who might be thinking about this, but don't know how to contextualize it,

1961
03:11:45.44 --> 03:11:50.64
is a sign to me that this is making sense to people. Look, it's a hard genre because it's so,

1962
03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:56.56
it's spread so thin. But the time and the place that we live in, our society right now,

1963
03:11:56.56 --> 03:12:01.76
where people's cell phones, their virtual realities, are more important and significant than

1964
03:12:01.76 --> 03:12:07.36
their actual reality. At the detriment to their physical and mental health and wellness,

1965
03:12:08.48 --> 03:12:14.80
it needs, we need to be bringing this to bear in conversations, to get people involved in something

1966
03:12:14.80 --> 03:12:21.44
outside of their cell phone. So it's my mission, but it's become something so different that I thought

1967
03:12:21.44 --> 03:12:28.16
it was going to become as far as scaling a business for a call. Let me tell you what I think.

1968
03:12:28.16 --> 03:12:36.96
This is what I think is very cool. And I was wondering if you would get there just from what you've

1969
03:12:36.96 --> 03:12:44.96
seen so far to what my perspective is and what my perspective is is your sort of like,

1970
03:12:44.96 --> 03:12:50.16
what everything you just said to me is the tip of the iceberg, actually. It's just the tip of the

1971
03:12:50.16 --> 03:12:59.36
iceberg and I'll tell you what I mean by that. If you look it for me, GJ2. GJ2 for me was a huge component

1972
03:12:59.36 --> 03:13:04.64
of my life, not because I learned how to fight, not because I got in good physical condition,

1973
03:13:04.64 --> 03:13:09.92
but because I learned a new way of thinking. And I started to understand the world from a different

1974
03:13:09.92 --> 03:13:16.16
perspective. And I started to see correlations between GJ2, combat tactics, leadership, interacting

1975
03:13:16.16 --> 03:13:22.40
with other human beings, the way I approach problems, the way I thought. GJ2 became a way of thinking.

1976
03:13:22.40 --> 03:13:28.000
And it's actually, I can't say it's GJ2 is that way of thinking because it's everything combined.

1977
03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:32.24
It turns and translates into the sort of just the way of thinking for me.

1978
03:13:33.68 --> 03:13:42.16
Well, when I start thinking about being prepared about handling situations, about reacting

1979
03:13:42.16 --> 03:13:49.84
to emergency situations, about handling contingencies, all those things you can learn,

1980
03:13:50.80 --> 03:14:00.16
you can learn for the specific, for the specific genre of actually applying to a survival

1981
03:14:00.16 --> 03:14:06.48
situation, just like you can learn an arm lock for actually applying to a grappling situation.

1982
03:14:06.48 --> 03:14:13.60
But guess what? You can take that mindset and you can apply to everything that you do. So you can take

1983
03:14:13.60 --> 03:14:20.72
what you're teaching about thinking through a problem, about foresight, about preparing for a certain

1984
03:14:20.72 --> 03:14:24.56
scenario and the contingencies around that. You can actually apply that not just to how you're

1985
03:14:24.56 --> 03:14:30.88
going to handle a fire or an earthquake or a civil unrest, but how you're going to handle a business

1986
03:14:30.88 --> 03:14:36.24
situation that you're in, how you're going to handle an interaction with someone in your own family.

1987
03:14:36.24 --> 03:14:39.36
It's not a hostile interaction, but it's an interaction that you need to think through.

1988
03:14:40.80 --> 03:14:46.000
So the way that you're talking about preparedness and I've told this to people before, they're like,

1989
03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:50.32
well, you know, how good do you have to get a J2? Like if you need to, at a certain point,

1990
03:14:50.32 --> 03:14:57.52
you're a blue belt, you're 225 pounds, Joko. You're okay. You can handle yourself in a self-defense

1991
03:14:57.52 --> 03:15:03.52
situation. Yeah, absolutely I can. What about shooting? Well, what are the chances, Joko,

1992
03:15:03.52 --> 03:15:10.40
that you're going to get into a gunfight? Your 49 years old, you know, you got a life in

1993
03:15:10.40 --> 03:15:14.80
kids, you live in a nice area. What are the chances you're getting in a gunfight? Why do you need to be

1994
03:15:14.80 --> 03:15:19.36
training? Why do you need to, why should I be training? People asked me, why should I work with a

1995
03:15:19.36 --> 03:15:25.28
firearm? Well, let me tell you why. Because yeah, you have this narrow chance that for whatever

1996
03:15:25.28 --> 03:15:28.88
reason somebody enters your house or you're in a situation, somebody tries to steal your car

1997
03:15:28.88 --> 03:15:33.12
hurt you or whatever, where you got to use your firearm. The chances of that, let's face it. They're

1998
03:15:33.12 --> 03:15:40.80
tiny. But guess what you get? Guess what you get from practicing and aren't like shooting.

1999
03:15:41.84 --> 03:15:47.04
You learn how to control your breathing. You learn how to detach. You learn how to refocus after

2000
03:15:47.04 --> 03:15:52.72
you throw a shot and still take the next clean shot without worrying about what just happened.

2001
03:15:52.72 --> 03:16:00.96
You learn how to calm yourself down. You learn how to associate or disassociate from problems

2002
03:16:00.96 --> 03:16:06.32
that are happening right in front of you. So there's applications to the art of shooting a weapon

2003
03:16:06.32 --> 03:16:10.32
that you can apply to everything you could do. There's applications for what you learn in

2004
03:16:10.32 --> 03:16:15.76
Jitu that apply to everything you do. There's applications to, if I went to one of your courses

2005
03:16:16.64 --> 03:16:22.64
and you taught me how to what I should put together for a go bag for a car. Here's what you should

2006
03:16:22.64 --> 03:16:26.72
think through. Cool. I can promise you. I'm going to use that. I'm going to put it go bag

2007
03:16:26.72 --> 03:16:29.84
in my car and I put together a good one. But guess what else am I going to do? I'm going to think

2008
03:16:29.84 --> 03:16:34.80
about a contingency for my business and what we can do as a business to prepare for a certain

2009
03:16:34.80 --> 03:16:41.44
contingency. What do I need to prepare? What do I need to think through as a leader to be ready?

2010
03:16:42.16 --> 03:16:48.16
So you're talking about a narrow, when you talk about this mindset of preparedness,

2011
03:16:49.44 --> 03:16:53.76
you're talking about a pretty narrow thing. How am I going to survive a situation? To me,

2012
03:16:53.76 --> 03:17:01.04
it's applicable to everything that a human being does. Why does a special operations guy

2013
03:17:02.24 --> 03:17:08.80
when there's an earthquake or a flood or a car accident? Part of it, part of the reason that they

2014
03:17:08.80 --> 03:17:15.68
survive is, hey, they know what to do. They know how to break a windshield. They know what to do in

2015
03:17:15.68 --> 03:17:21.68
that specific technique. They technically know what to do. But part of it is, number one, they've

2016
03:17:21.68 --> 03:17:26.32
been under pressure before. And number two, they know how to think through the problem that they're facing.

2017
03:17:26.88 --> 03:17:33.20
So what you're teaching isn't only applicable to survival. It's actually applicable to everything.

2018
03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:43.04
And that to me is it should broaden your audience to everybody. And I like the fact that you said,

2019
03:17:43.04 --> 03:17:48.08
there's a certain alignment with what you're doing. The alignment is, you know, we run one of

2020
03:17:48.08 --> 03:17:58.000
this with businesses sometimes. If you go higher up enough, the alignment ladder in a business,

2021
03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.40
you know, you might want to do something one way. I want to do something different way.

2022
03:18:01.76 --> 03:18:07.68
Ultimately, I say, hey, listen, do we want to take care of our clients? Yes, do we want to make some

2023
03:18:07.68 --> 03:18:11.68
money? Yes, we do. Do we want to take care of the people on our team? Yes, we do. So we're going to be

2024
03:18:11.68 --> 03:18:14.72
a line there. Like there's no one, you're not going to, if you and I earn business together,

2025
03:18:14.72 --> 03:18:17.04
you know, I say, well, actually, I don't want to make any money. Or actually, you know, I want to

2026
03:18:17.04 --> 03:18:21.12
screw over our clients. I actually know I don't want to take care of our team. You're not going to say that.

2027
03:18:21.12 --> 03:18:25.92
And if you did say that, we were not working together. But 99% of the time you go to any business,

2028
03:18:25.92 --> 03:18:30.08
they, you can go to a point where you're aligned, where you and I are thinking the same, hey,

2029
03:18:30.08 --> 03:18:34.80
listen, we want to take care of our clients. We want to take care of our team. We want to make some

2030
03:18:34.80 --> 03:18:39.60
money. We can agree with that. What you just said, I don't care where you're from. I don't care where you're

2031
03:18:39.60 --> 03:18:47.36
from. You take, what did you say, a liberal and San Francisco or a freaking redneck in Montana?

2032
03:18:47.36 --> 03:18:51.04
And you pull them into a room and say, do you want to be able to take care of your family?

2033
03:18:51.84 --> 03:18:54.40
What are they going to say? They're going to say yes. Do you want to be able to handle

2034
03:18:54.40 --> 03:18:57.92
yourself in a pressure situation? They're going to say yes. Do you want to be able to take care of

2035
03:18:57.92 --> 03:19:03.60
yourself? They're going to say yes. So there's an alignment that's inherent in what you're teaching,

2036
03:19:04.24 --> 03:19:08.88
that absolutely will bring people together. But it'll make them better, not just because they're

2037
03:19:08.88 --> 03:19:15.52
able to survive. It'll teach them a way of thinking that will progress them in every aspect of their

2038
03:19:15.52 --> 03:19:21.20
life. And that's why I think it's even more powerful than what you're saying because I could take

2039
03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:28.40
some company executives and send them to one of your courses. And yes, it's a cool benefit

2040
03:19:29.12 --> 03:19:33.28
that they're going to learn about survival. Just like I run a program where we take our guy,

2041
03:19:33.28 --> 03:19:37.76
we take civilians. We teach him how to do a room clearance. We teach him how to move between

2042
03:19:37.76 --> 03:19:45.20
buildings. This is a 45 minute session. How to clear a room and how to move from building to

2043
03:19:45.20 --> 03:19:49.84
building in a group. That's what we teach him. Then we say, okay, here's your mission. And we start

2044
03:19:49.84 --> 03:19:55.52
giving omissions. Now, what do they learn about clearing buildings? Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter at

2045
03:19:55.52 --> 03:19:59.60
all. But what do they learn about leadership? What do they learn about thinking under pressure?

2046
03:19:59.60 --> 03:20:03.04
What do they learn about how to get people to move in the right direction? What do they learn

2047
03:20:03.04 --> 03:20:08.000
about being able to detach and take a step back and not get caught up in the firefight? We use

2048
03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:12.48
we use later attack. Not get caught up in their laser gun and freaking out about that.

2049
03:20:13.12 --> 03:20:18.08
So we take people and put them through this tactical training, not so that they can become

2050
03:20:18.08 --> 03:20:24.48
great tacticians. But so that they can lead better. So what you're doing, hey, listen, it's great.

2051
03:20:24.48 --> 03:20:29.68
You put people through some training that they learn survival skills. But to me,

2052
03:20:29.68 --> 03:20:37.44
an even higher up of a higher archie of benefits is that they learn a way of thinking.

2053
03:20:37.44 --> 03:20:40.96
That's going to benefit them in every aspect of the life. I think that's badass.

2054
03:20:40.96 --> 03:20:47.76
Yeah, appreciate it. The lesson is learned that we found is exactly that most often

2055
03:20:48.56 --> 03:20:54.000
people aren't exposed. They have limited exposure. So when they have the opportunity to do something

2056
03:20:54.000 --> 03:21:01.60
like a five-day experience, we do corporate training. We've done it. I've consulted for Oracle

2057
03:21:01.60 --> 03:21:07.20
and some other companies. It's not about like you said the technical experience. The bottom line

2058
03:21:07.20 --> 03:21:11.92
is they're not going to learn enough reps to build that technical expertise unless that's on their

2059
03:21:11.92 --> 03:21:17.84
own. But the life lessons they learn and taking it back and processing stress like you said

2060
03:21:17.84 --> 03:21:24.56
is so important and valuable. I think what's happening with this introduction of technology in our lives

2061
03:21:24.56 --> 03:21:32.16
is its limiting our ability to be exposed. So one of the advice is that I give for people

2062
03:21:32.16 --> 03:21:37.12
who are like, how do I change my mindset? A lot of people say mindset, mindset, what the hell does that

2063
03:21:37.12 --> 03:21:43.12
mean? And our field of expertise has to do with resilience. Your ability to bounce back, your

2064
03:21:43.12 --> 03:21:48.72
ability wants to press the bounce back and to be stronger to thrive instead of just survive and get by.

2065
03:21:49.52 --> 03:21:56.24
So when we expose people to new challenges, it doesn't have to be extreme. You could just,

2066
03:21:56.24 --> 03:21:59.84
I mean we have extreme versions of this. We do sear school. We'll get a civilian sear school

2067
03:21:59.84 --> 03:22:04.96
which is fun to run. But those guys will come back from that experience from a five-day sear

2068
03:22:04.96 --> 03:22:11.52
experience survival escape resistivate and they'll go, this is the most impactful thing I've ever

2069
03:22:11.52 --> 03:22:19.20
done in my life and I'm like, really? Okay, let me reflect on my impactful experiences.

2070
03:22:19.20 --> 03:22:25.04
Oh yeah, Ranger School. When I was in Ranger School and I'm exposed and I'm vulnerable,

2071
03:22:25.68 --> 03:22:30.96
it's impactful because it's something different and we understand this obviously about even singled

2072
03:22:30.96 --> 03:22:37.04
celled organisms. If you're exposed to trauma, that is the first stage in growth because no

2073
03:22:37.04 --> 03:22:41.84
growth takes place without exposure to trauma. And so whatever that form factor is, getting

2074
03:22:41.84 --> 03:22:48.32
pummeled on the mats and jujitsu, you are learning as you go. You're breaking to build. And so

2075
03:22:49.28 --> 03:22:55.12
what's fascinating about this whole movement that I think is preparedness is that it's positive.

2076
03:22:55.12 --> 03:23:00.24
There's not a lot of negative things that take place in preparing people to be

2077
03:23:00.80 --> 03:23:06.000
prepared for that worst case scenario. You see a lot of positive impacts on community with law and

2078
03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:15.44
enforcement, with relationships, with peoples understanding. And for me, getting all this collective

2079
03:23:15.44 --> 03:23:20.72
of information and making sense of it and being able to clearly disseminate that is the biggest

2080
03:23:20.72 --> 03:23:26.40
challenge. But it's the funniest thing about the business. I mean, the LMS, for example, of creating

2081
03:23:26.40 --> 03:23:31.52
this idea that you could learn online and you could learn about these life-saving things. The

2082
03:23:31.52 --> 03:23:36.08
NACEA here came out and said, why would you teach somebody how to apply it, turn it online? Like

2083
03:23:36.08 --> 03:23:40.88
that don't you think that's kind of like a it's high in liability and it's neglectful? I'm like

2084
03:23:40.88 --> 03:23:47.44
do you could build a rocket ship inside of your garage off a YouTube video? So I could think

2085
03:23:47.44 --> 03:23:51.68
I think I could teach somebody how to stop the bleed with a technical, turn it get applied to their

2086
03:23:51.68 --> 03:23:58.08
body to help them survive. And so I'm fascinated by it's my passion, obviously, but I think you're

2087
03:23:58.08 --> 03:24:04.48
right. I think especially when it comes to leadership, there's a breakdown in our societies.

2088
03:24:04.48 --> 03:24:09.44
With guys not willing to get off the bench and do anything for themselves, I was doing a podcast

2089
03:24:09.44 --> 03:24:16.96
with Pete Blaber. It was a former CAD commander wrote the mission, the man in me, and worked

2090
03:24:16.96 --> 03:24:21.52
just wrote part two of that, which is the common sense way. And one of the things he talks about

2091
03:24:21.52 --> 03:24:27.44
is this idea of collaboration. And when you collaborate with somebody, when you have communication

2092
03:24:27.44 --> 03:24:33.20
and you have reciprocation, then you create the environment of us wanting to learn from each other,

2093
03:24:33.76 --> 03:24:39.36
but you also give people the confidence to stand up in their own communities and do something about it.

2094
03:24:39.36 --> 03:24:43.36
I don't care if it's not their community. Like, yeah, you want to run for city council. That's great.

2095
03:24:43.92 --> 03:24:48.48
You don't and you just want to stand up and get off your house for your family or even for yourself.

2096
03:24:48.48 --> 03:24:54.32
You're fat, you're sloppy, you're lazy, and you can make a change inside yourself because you

2097
03:24:54.32 --> 03:24:59.84
come to that realization. That's good. And for me, there's no revenue generated there.

2098
03:24:59.84 --> 03:25:04.80
It could be a podcast. It could be one way to dissemination. That impact is priceless. It's worth

2099
03:25:04.80 --> 03:25:12.16
everything in the world. So what are people going to do if they want to get in the game with you?

2100
03:25:12.16 --> 03:25:17.92
So they go to, they go to, fieldcraftsurvival.com. That's it. I mean,

2101
03:25:17.92 --> 03:25:22.16
fieldcraftsurvival, look, we're all over the map on fieldcraftsurvival. We'll get a podcast, we get the

2102
03:25:22.16 --> 03:25:29.44
website. We can port you to theweedeprepair.com, which is the LMS or members dot americancontinus.com.

2103
03:25:31.52 --> 03:25:38.64
The start point is start like in this experience, listening to the long-form versions for free

2104
03:25:38.64 --> 03:25:43.76
from YouTube, from podcast, and start developing an understanding of what you want. And then,

2105
03:25:43.76 --> 03:25:49.04
you know, it's all over the map on, look, on Instagram, fieldcraftsurvival. My personal's

2106
03:25:49.04 --> 03:25:55.92
Mike.au.gov, but every day I'm living this. One thing I haven't detracted from is consistency.

2107
03:25:56.64 --> 03:26:01.52
I might be making wrong business decisions. I mean, I might be jacked up in many ways,

2108
03:26:01.52 --> 03:26:06.40
but one thing I could never be criticized for is consistency. So I wake up every single day with

2109
03:26:06.40 --> 03:26:10.56
this on my mind. And in the last six years that I started this venture, I don't think I've had one

2110
03:26:10.56 --> 03:26:16.72
day off. And that's okay. Because that my grind is this purpose. And, you know, selfishly, I don't

2111
03:26:16.72 --> 03:26:23.68
know if this is a tactic. Maybe it's done when we're unaware of it. But I've built a thing around me

2112
03:26:24.08 --> 03:26:30.32
that felt and feels like the team life that I had, the culture that I came from. And I get the

2113
03:26:30.32 --> 03:26:37.60
feeling in it in here, and in your gym, and this, and the people that I've met, and in a similar

2114
03:26:37.60 --> 03:26:43.44
experience, I'm doing the same thing on my end. And a parallel, parallel, but also synergistic

2115
03:26:43.44 --> 03:26:48.24
universe. Is there any mistakes that you made from a business perspective that

2116
03:26:49.04 --> 03:26:53.36
were close to catastrophic? Have you screwed up anything really bad? Or are they all just kind of

2117
03:26:53.36 --> 03:26:59.68
little learners you go? Kind of learners you go. I think early on, I almost made a mistake early on

2118
03:27:00.40 --> 03:27:05.12
where I was told in the diversification of all the things I was doing as too much. And I get that.

2119
03:27:05.84 --> 03:27:11.68
If you look at me even today, I mean, there's a lot of things we got going on. But at the time,

2120
03:27:11.68 --> 03:27:18.32
they all the verticals were spread so thin that nothing was getting traction. And so I was told,

2121
03:27:18.32 --> 03:27:24.24
find one vertical, one thing, one kit, one training session, and double down on that. Create one

2122
03:27:24.24 --> 03:27:30.16
little tiny vertical scale that you can make revenue from and then diversify. And I said,

2123
03:27:30.16 --> 03:27:34.88
not, I can't do that. I said because this whole thing that's preparedness is very diversified

2124
03:27:34.88 --> 03:27:39.68
in the first place. I can't teach mindset without teaching physical training. I can't teach physical

2125
03:27:39.68 --> 03:27:45.60
training without an understanding of a mobility platform into your life. So we have to do everything

2126
03:27:45.60 --> 03:27:50.72
it wants. And so doing that was challenging because it almost broke me. I'm literally it broke me.

2127
03:27:50.72 --> 03:27:57.92
Like, I lived in my business with my girlfriend for four months and we literally lived in a warehouse

2128
03:27:57.92 --> 03:28:03.52
for four months and it didn't have a shower. It had a pump shower that we can't with. That was

2129
03:28:03.52 --> 03:28:08.48
our living circumstance. But you make those sacrifices in business and then all of a sudden everything

2130
03:28:08.48 --> 03:28:15.04
scaled at once. And then you're like, oh, okay, so this is the place to be now. So now it's about tactics

2131
03:28:15.04 --> 03:28:21.28
and you know, developing the right flow supply chain issues, all these things that everybody's

2132
03:28:21.28 --> 03:28:25.36
dealing with in business. It's a it's a train wreck. But I wouldn't try it for the world.

2133
03:28:25.36 --> 03:28:31.52
And where are you based on it? So right now we're in a heaversity Utah headquarters is there.

2134
03:28:31.52 --> 03:28:36.24
We're standing up Kevin Owens, a former sniper team made him on who's unilaterally running

2135
03:28:36.24 --> 03:28:43.76
a Philcraft NC. He's standing that up and then Rahal Martinez, my training director, has 20 subcontractors

2136
03:28:43.76 --> 03:28:50.64
that teach all over the US. He's standing up in Arizona near Phoenix, north anthem, uh Arizona,

2137
03:28:50.64 --> 03:28:57.04
which is north of Phoenix. So we're standing up these small little verticals, uh Evan Hayford,

2138
03:28:57.04 --> 03:29:01.84
who's a buddy of mine, uh Owens Black rifle coffee has given me the opportunity to sell

2139
03:29:01.84 --> 03:29:07.68
and display about the size of this table, Philcraft survival swag and gear that we sell for equipment.

2140
03:29:08.56 --> 03:29:13.68
And that will be in every Black rifle coffee. It's in two right now. I'll be in four next week.

2141
03:29:13.68 --> 03:29:18.96
Be it hopefully in a thousand when it competing with Starbucks. Um, but yeah, we're all over the map,

2142
03:29:18.96 --> 03:29:25.36
man. That's freaking awesome. Well, hey, man, I think we've been going for, uh, I don't know,

2143
03:29:25.36 --> 03:29:30.32
we're yet four hours yet. I don't know. Three and a half something like that. Um, I don't want

2144
03:29:30.32 --> 03:29:35.04
to take up too much more years. I'm going to know you got a little, little, uh, plane to catch echo.

2145
03:29:35.84 --> 03:29:39.92
Echo Charles, you got anything. I do not. Thanks for coming. Good to meet you. Nice meeting you,

2146
03:29:39.92 --> 03:29:45.76
too, man. No questions from echo Charles. Not today. We covered it all. You, you,

2147
03:29:46.40 --> 03:29:52.80
one podcast we were talking about living off the land. Yeah. And, um, you know, I was, uh, I was a

2148
03:29:52.80 --> 03:29:57.60
radio man in my, in the last few days. So I was always travel light and, you know, carry like no food,

2149
03:29:57.60 --> 03:30:03.84
just water batteries in the radio. And, and then we were talking about whatever was, uh,

2150
03:30:03.84 --> 03:30:08.72
like we were talking about the Civil War and how those guys were just, they would live off the land.

2151
03:30:08.72 --> 03:30:16.56
Right. And echo chimed in the fact that, you know, he had also, he could also live off the land.

2152
03:30:16.56 --> 03:30:21.20
That exact. So, all right. He would say, and, you know, if he's going to LA for a couple of days,

2153
03:30:21.20 --> 03:30:25.36
yeah, doesn't need to back a lot. Yeah. Because worst case scenario, live off the land. You

2154
03:30:25.36 --> 03:30:30.48
don't, didn't bring a toothbrush. Brush cool. Roll into Walmart. Yeah. Roll into a wall greens.

2155
03:30:31.04 --> 03:30:34.48
You get a toothbrush. That's what I'm talking about. Urban surprise. That's freaking

2156
03:30:34.48 --> 03:30:38.48
a little bit surprising, man. I'm surprised you didn't ask about like what the best, you know,

2157
03:30:38.48 --> 03:30:43.04
store was to get to the front of that city. Yes, but you see, yes, they're pretty consistent.

2158
03:30:43.04 --> 03:30:48.48
Whatever Brett conceptually, it was the same thing. Same same. Instead of packing a big

2159
03:30:48.48 --> 03:30:55.92
bag or whatever, like, you live off the land. Yeah. Urban sprawl. That's urban land.

2160
03:30:55.92 --> 03:31:00.24
It's the same thing. Yeah. It's an ecosystem. It's an ecosystem. Let the environment provide.

2161
03:31:00.24 --> 03:31:03.76
That's it. Right. Yeah. There you go. Right on. Sounds good.

2162
03:31:04.64 --> 03:31:10.24
Mike, any closing thoughts? No, I just want to just take a second and just say thank you for the opportunity.

2163
03:31:10.24 --> 03:31:16.40
I will, we'll say, just like I say on a lot of podcasts with guys of your caliber and your

2164
03:31:16.40 --> 03:31:21.84
background that you're doing something that I wish a lot of guys with our background would do,

2165
03:31:21.84 --> 03:31:28.48
which is get off the bench and take a stand and commit to this burden of responsibility. What you're

2166
03:31:28.48 --> 03:31:33.84
doing is growing a business, but what you're also doing is impacting young people's lives and

2167
03:31:33.84 --> 03:31:39.36
every walk of a life to do something with their lives. That's purpose. That's different than

2168
03:31:39.36 --> 03:31:46.24
anything else that's a structure and business plan. This is an impact on culture. I think from, you know,

2169
03:31:46.24 --> 03:31:54.000
it's far back as we can record every major battle that's been fought. Those men came from more

2170
03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:59.68
in affected popular culture. Whether it was cut in, you know, P51 Mustangs, making hot rods,

2171
03:31:59.68 --> 03:32:07.52
chopping hoarlies, having an extreme impact. There is a burden of responsibility of men like you and

2172
03:32:07.52 --> 03:32:13.36
me that need to step up and accept that reality. The John Plaster, the John Strucker Myers,

2173
03:32:13.36 --> 03:32:18.56
the world, are the ones who affected my life and me stepping up and doing something about it.

2174
03:32:18.56 --> 03:32:22.80
I'm not talking about just military service. I'm talking about doing something impactful for your life.

2175
03:32:23.52 --> 03:32:32.000
And this, the books, the business, that's the vertical and revenue. That's what scales the hierarchy

2176
03:32:32.88 --> 03:32:40.64
and engros, but the impact it transcends across society. And without you, without your abilities

2177
03:32:40.64 --> 03:32:45.20
to stay in it and stay committed, we wouldn't be affecting popular culture like we are.

2178
03:32:45.20 --> 03:32:50.96
And I think you're leading the way in that way. I'm humbled to have been on this podcast and to

2179
03:32:50.96 --> 03:32:55.12
have the opportunity to speak to your audience, but I just want to let you know that personally.

2180
03:32:55.92 --> 03:33:02.000
It's a big deal. You're doing it. You did it in military service. To me, we come from similar lines.

2181
03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:05.60
That's not the greatest impact. The greatest impact is what you're doing right now.

2182
03:33:05.60 --> 03:33:10.72
It's all appreciate it. Well, thanks. I appreciate it. I'm not sure I'm all about you.

2183
03:33:10.72 --> 03:33:17.12
I've made me out to be, but when I look at what you did in the past and freaking just talking about your deployments,

2184
03:33:17.12 --> 03:33:24.56
I mean, not even, there's not even any words to describe. And I know that you sit there and think of the back of your head

2185
03:33:24.56 --> 03:33:32.56
of like, you know guys that did 12 more deployments compared to your whatever five or six. And I think that's the feeling we all have all the time.

2186
03:33:32.56 --> 03:33:40.24
And you even said it today, there's you found out I found out there's there's someone and not just someone,

2187
03:33:40.24 --> 03:33:46.56
but there's a bunch of people way better than we are at that job and God bless them for going out there and getting after it.

2188
03:33:47.20 --> 03:33:52.24
And that being said, what you did to hold the line, what you did to carry the torch,

2189
03:33:53.12 --> 03:33:59.28
appreciate it. And then back at you once again, what you're doing right now, you know, I think what you're doing right now is

2190
03:33:59.28 --> 03:34:04.72
going to have a huge impact and is having huge impact, getting people's mindset straight.

2191
03:34:07.04 --> 03:34:14.56
In a time when mindsets are all over the map, seeing you do that, that's impressive.

2192
03:34:15.28 --> 03:34:19.20
And I hope you keep doing it, brother. Thanks, brother. We'll do right on.

2193
03:34:22.16 --> 03:34:25.28
And with that Mike Glover has left the building,

2194
03:34:25.28 --> 03:34:27.44
I appreciate my coming on.

2195
03:34:31.04 --> 03:34:32.96
Freaking great story.

2196
03:34:34.88 --> 03:34:38.16
Bottom incredible stuff and what you're doing right now is awesome.

2197
03:34:40.48 --> 03:34:43.04
Talking about preparedness, talking about being ready.

2198
03:34:46.08 --> 03:34:50.32
Seems like we should start fundamentally. There's one area we can start to be ready.

2199
03:34:50.32 --> 03:34:57.52
Today, echo Charles, what do you think? There's always ways to be ready, be more ready.

2200
03:34:59.68 --> 03:35:04.64
I think that self evaluation part was kind of critical. I mean, it wasn't surprising.

2201
03:35:06.64 --> 03:35:12.72
But it was a good reminder. It's like one of those answers that lies right below the surface

2202
03:35:12.72 --> 03:35:17.52
that you already know is there, but it's not always revealed. It's self-reflect.

2203
03:35:17.52 --> 03:35:21.04
Evaluate where are we? You would think that's obvious, but it's not.

2204
03:35:21.04 --> 03:35:23.44
It's not a lot of people go through life without evaluation,

2205
03:35:23.44 --> 03:35:26.32
evaluating where they're at, where they can improve, what they can do better.

2206
03:35:26.32 --> 03:35:32.64
Yeah, it's true. And I'd say this before, where it's in a way, depends on how you look at it.

2207
03:35:32.64 --> 03:35:35.44
It's a good problem to have. It means a lot of our problems are solved.

2208
03:35:35.44 --> 03:35:39.04
You know, if you're not worried about this or that happening, that just means that

2209
03:35:40.16 --> 03:35:43.36
it's not happening very often. You know, kind of a thing, which is a good thing.

2210
03:35:43.36 --> 03:35:53.36
Solved problems tends to be a good thing. Tens do. Okay. Anyway, so we got to be careful about

2211
03:35:53.36 --> 03:36:00.64
that kind of stuff. We do want to keep ourselves ready, strong, healthy. You won't have to

2212
03:36:00.64 --> 03:36:10.56
exercise strength every single day, aside from in the gym. It seems to say, like you doing 20

2213
03:36:10.56 --> 03:36:18.72
reps squats. Right? Like the results, the reason you do that. That reason is not going to be

2214
03:36:18.72 --> 03:36:24.24
demonstrated, displayed, put into play every single day in real life. It's not going to.

2215
03:36:25.92 --> 03:36:31.92
I guess maybe conceptually it might, but no at all. But there's a bigger purpose here.

2216
03:36:31.92 --> 03:36:37.92
It's the same. It's to stay ready, realistically as ready as you possibly can.

2217
03:36:37.92 --> 03:36:44.08
And all these different elements. So while we're on this path of readiness, capability, health,

2218
03:36:44.88 --> 03:36:49.36
mental and physical, we might need some supplementation. Good news is,

2219
03:36:49.36 --> 03:36:56.72
Jocco has supplementation called Jocco Fuel. So let's start with discipline. Go. RTD

2220
03:36:56.72 --> 03:37:04.000
cans. It is the new, the new era of energy drinks. Actual energy drinks. Yeah, my

2221
03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:10.08
glory said something real simple, but real true. I like it. I like that it's healthy.

2222
03:37:11.20 --> 03:37:16.08
You don't have to worry about poisoning yourself anymore. I'm paraphrasing that last

2223
03:37:16.08 --> 03:37:21.44
part. But it's true though. And I said before too, where yeah, you look, sometimes I'm going to drink

2224
03:37:21.44 --> 03:37:27.28
two of those in a row. Sometimes three. I did drink two of them just now. Yes, so you don't have

2225
03:37:27.28 --> 03:37:32.72
to, there's no back end price anymore. It's like, oh wait, I'm actually technically, I'm not worried

2226
03:37:32.72 --> 03:37:38.96
about becoming a type two diabetic this afternoon. Correct. I didn't just drink 72 grams of sugar

2227
03:37:38.96 --> 03:37:44.72
or whatever. No, I had monk fruit, which is technically good for you. Yeah, that was a good point.

2228
03:37:44.72 --> 03:37:50.96
You made this off air, by the way. Where you're like, yeah, there's five calories in the

2229
03:37:50.96 --> 03:37:55.44
new ones, there's 15 calories. Because it comes from food. Yeah. The sweetener comes from food. Not some

2230
03:37:56.40 --> 03:38:00.32
chemical that shouldn't be in your body. Yeah. They can't provide any kind of calories.

2231
03:38:00.32 --> 03:38:07.28
Between five and ten calories per can. Why is that? Like you just said, because it's not chemicals.

2232
03:38:07.28 --> 03:38:13.44
You know what has zero calories? Calories? A chemical. That's what has zero calories. What has

2233
03:38:13.44 --> 03:38:21.04
some calories? Monk fruit has some calories. Yeah. Five. Yeah, so it's one of those deals, man. Like I said,

2234
03:38:21.04 --> 03:38:24.48
the new era of energy drinks. You can drink some energy drinks. There's your energy drink.

2235
03:38:24.48 --> 03:38:29.92
Great there. On the path 100%. Two. That's not like it's like, well, you know, preserve

2236
03:38:29.92 --> 03:38:35.76
it. It's not partial path. 100% on the path. 100%. No deacion. So yes, you can get these

2237
03:38:35.76 --> 03:38:39.44
in it. There's new flavors out by the way. You're going to have to check them out yourself.

2238
03:38:40.56 --> 03:38:45.92
Very impactful, exciting flavors. As far as flavors go. You know, you can get them at

2239
03:38:45.92 --> 03:38:50.40
wall wall if you're in the area that you have wall wall. You can get them at a vitamin shop.

2240
03:38:51.12 --> 03:38:58.88
By the way, talking about flavors, what I find interesting is some families of beverages. They kind

2241
03:38:58.88 --> 03:39:06.56
of all taste the same. They might have a different label on it or a different name. This stuff

2242
03:39:06.56 --> 03:39:11.20
tastes legitimately different. Like you might have one or be like, this is the best thing I've ever

2243
03:39:11.20 --> 03:39:16.88
tasted. You might have an other one, not like it. Try a different one. Yeah. Because there's definitely

2244
03:39:16.88 --> 03:39:24.48
more variation in flavor. With these flavors, then there is with a normal company, a normal drink.

2245
03:39:24.48 --> 03:39:29.04
Who's just like, look, they know what the flavor profile is to get people addicted. So they put

2246
03:39:29.04 --> 03:39:34.000
a bunch of sugar in there, name it something and cool. They're moving forward. We're not doing that.

2247
03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:39.52
We're giving you legit flavor profiles with different tastes. It's a good point for your mind.

2248
03:39:39.52 --> 03:39:46.56
Open. Also, you can get them at originusa.com. Also, as far as supplementation goes,

2249
03:39:46.56 --> 03:39:52.64
we have stuff for your joints, super-cryl oils and joint warfare. Also for your immunity, vitamin D3

2250
03:39:52.64 --> 03:39:59.92
and cold ore. Also, if you need additional protein, if you want additional protein. Or if you want

2251
03:39:59.92 --> 03:40:06.64
dessert. And the ore and ore from dessert. Boom. But I had one last night. Not to go to

2252
03:40:06.64 --> 03:40:14.24
people do it. The peanut butter? No, yeah. One peanut butter. That's a win. A total win. And it's

2253
03:40:14.24 --> 03:40:18.24
not like I was like, let me just choose the pair. I just grabbed anyone and it happened to be that.

2254
03:40:18.24 --> 03:40:24.24
Yeah. So I'm like cool. I went kind of hard though. I don't recommend this all the time. I put

2255
03:40:24.24 --> 03:40:30.40
some chocolate chips in there. On accident put too many. Not that way too many, but too many. And then

2256
03:40:30.40 --> 03:40:34.96
banana. This kind of disqualifies everything you're saying. A little bit. You can't just add chocolate

2257
03:40:34.96 --> 03:40:43.60
chips. It always tastes really good. You added chocolate chips, bro. But it was like almost too sweet.

2258
03:40:43.60 --> 03:40:49.20
I think because of the additional chocolate chips. Yeah. I pondered the whole thing. Okay. You're

2259
03:40:49.20 --> 03:40:56.000
still very, very good. You know what you do? You know those the dark chocolate chunks. You can

2260
03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:00.96
buy dark chocolate. Yeah. Whatever percentage put that in there. That would have been perfect even

2261
03:41:00.96 --> 03:41:07.76
for accidentally put too much. Anyway, there's other flavors as well. So don't, you know, don't

2262
03:41:07.76 --> 03:41:13.28
slack on that either way, whatever flavor you like, milk, additional protein, another clean deal.

2263
03:41:13.28 --> 03:41:19.04
It's not like some sugar filled deal. It is once you put freaking chocolate chips in it. You know,

2264
03:41:19.04 --> 03:41:23.76
it's going to depend on the level of, uh, it's really good to say. It's like a dark chocolate.

2265
03:41:23.76 --> 03:41:28.56
It's like a turning the Pete Roberts with the vegan chip cubes under your tongue. It was just one of

2266
03:41:28.56 --> 03:41:32.96
those things. You know, it happened some time. But I don't put chocolate chips in there. It's freaking

2267
03:41:32.96 --> 03:41:39.68
delicious. Yeah. Totally does. So there you go. Get some milk. Get some, get what you need. Yeah.

2268
03:41:39.68 --> 03:41:47.92
Dark filled.com. And by the way, this is important. It's important. Oh, just this is important.

2269
03:41:47.92 --> 03:41:53.76
I'm going to say something that isn't important. It's important. If you want to get free shipping,

Boom, all made in America. So you're supporting yourself. You're supporting America as well.

2278
03:42:48.64 --> 03:42:55.36
Also, jiu-jitsu. When when? Big time. Big time. Also, jiu-jitsu. It's called jiu-jitsu. So you

2279
03:42:55.36 --> 03:42:59.36
got a jiu-jitsu.com. And this is where you can get Rash guards, t-shirts,

2280
03:43:00.72 --> 03:43:07.28
trucker hats, right? The Flexit hats, huddies, all this good cool stuff, representing the path,

2281
03:43:07.28 --> 03:43:13.52
disciplining, cost freedom. Good. When things are going bad, this is always some good. It

2282
03:43:13.52 --> 03:43:19.12
comes from it. Iconic video. Words from the man right here. Then the last you want to represent that.

2283
03:43:19.12 --> 03:43:23.44
That's where you can get the shirts on Jocco's store. So, in this video, that's iconic,

2284
03:43:23.44 --> 03:43:27.84
or is it the words? I don't know. I don't know. I had any value-weighted kind of things. Like both,

2285
03:43:27.84 --> 03:43:34.24
I guess, technically, but you're saying you made an iconic video is what I'm here. Either way.

2286
03:43:34.24 --> 03:43:38.08
Good job. Either way. We have a subscription situation as well. For shirts.

2287
03:43:38.08 --> 03:43:45.60
Designs a little bit different. Iconic design. That's a subject for debate and thank,

2288
03:43:45.60 --> 03:43:51.12
but people do seem to like them. You want to then cool-neutral it every month. High quality, by the way.

2289
03:43:51.12 --> 03:43:56.72
Boom, you can subscribe for that to that. It's called the shirt locker. You can get it on Jocco's store.

2295
03:44:30.64 --> 03:44:37.84
trying to block or erase or put in Jack to Aber. All this stuff that they could do.

2296

03:44:55.28 --> 03:45:03.52
cool stuff that we haven't really even started yet. But we got cool ideas that will come out.

2300
03:45:03.52 --> 03:45:07.60
We have a YouTube channel, subscribe to that. If you want to see the videos that I am the

2301
03:45:07.60 --> 03:45:14.24
assistant director of. And the videos that sometimes I am in them, which is kind of cool that

2302
03:45:14.24 --> 03:45:20.16
I do, I do role. I both assistant direct and I. And you're the talent. Yeah, both talent.

2303
03:45:20.16 --> 03:45:26.64
Either way, yeah, that it is true. We do a YouTube channel video. Does it make you mad when you're

2304
03:45:28.32 --> 03:45:33.52
directing a video? And then I give a little suggestion and it kind of makes a big difference.

2305
03:45:34.72 --> 03:45:40.16
Because you always see my little bit frustrated. You always see my little bit frustrated.

2306
03:45:40.16 --> 03:45:45.52
You kind of, the good thing I'll say, your humble enough to be like, you do the shot.

2307
03:45:45.52 --> 03:45:52.32
Whatever the adjustment is. But then I feel like it. I feel like you have a hard, I think those

2308
03:45:52.32 --> 03:45:56.80
nights you don't sleep as good as you do. If you come in and you got the shots. Well,

2309
03:45:56.80 --> 03:46:04.24
I'll wise man once told me. And when I say once, I mean plenty of times that as a leader,

2310
03:46:04.24 --> 03:46:10.88
I need to always, my goal should be to do your team members idea, not your own idea.

2311
03:46:10.88 --> 03:46:15.20
So from a leadership perspective, you do a good job of going like, yeah, good. That's

2312
03:46:15.20 --> 03:46:20.08
sounds like a good shot. We'll do that shot. I like it a lot. That's good. Even if it's an 80%

2313
03:46:20.08 --> 03:46:24.96
solution. Even if the shots in a person's solution. What I'm asking you, so from a leadership,

2314
03:46:24.96 --> 03:46:33.60
giving you an A minus. But what I'm saying is when you go home at night and the little demon

2315
03:46:33.60 --> 03:46:40.32
start to knock at the door and you wonder why the assistant director had to come up with that shot.

2316
03:46:40.32 --> 03:46:45.04
Yeah, had to say, hey, let me give you a little help.

2317
03:46:45.04 --> 03:46:50.96
Sir, it looks like what happens. You did? It makes me happy.

2318
03:46:50.96 --> 03:46:55.36
You know, we were able to collectively come up with a viable idea.

2319
03:46:55.36 --> 03:46:59.20
You want to know why you got the A minus? Because I can see it in your face.

2320
03:46:59.92 --> 03:47:04.16
I can see it in your face. I can see the frustration when you don't come up with the shot.

2321
03:47:04.16 --> 03:47:10.80
When it's when you have to take advice from the AD, when you have to take advice from the AD,

2322
03:47:11.60 --> 03:47:16.32
yep, that's when I realize it. Yeah, it'll frustrated. I can see it in your face. I can see it in your eyes.

2323
03:47:16.32 --> 03:47:20.16
I can kind of feel it, too. Yeah, well, I'll give you credit. It's still an A.

2324
03:47:20.88 --> 03:47:25.20
Because you still do your best to get the good shot. I haven't had you sabotage a shot yet

2325
03:47:25.20 --> 03:47:29.52
and said, yeah, you know, it actually doesn't work. But I can see that it's frustrating.

2326
03:47:29.52 --> 03:47:33.84
Yeah, well, you keep talking to me with a condescending tone. I'm about to go

2327
03:47:33.84 --> 03:47:42.40
up. See plus on you pretty soon. Yeah. Either way. Anyway, psychological warfare. If you

2328
03:47:42.40 --> 03:47:48.32
know what that is, it's an album with tracks, jockel, talking to you through your ears. But why?

2329
03:47:48.32 --> 03:47:54.08
And how to get past moments of weakness, even if he imposes those weaknesses on you himself.

2330
03:47:55.36 --> 03:48:00.64
As the case mayor may not be sometimes. Yeah. Hey, Dakota Myers got a company called

2334
03:48:21.76 --> 03:48:28.16
interesting characters in there. Literature or something. Maybe literature, maybe poetry, maybe a

2335
03:48:28.16 --> 03:48:35.84
transcript. We're not sure what it's called. It's a new form of writing. If you want to check it out,

2336
03:48:37.36 --> 03:48:43.44
it's called Final Spin. Preorder it so that the publisher knows to print a bunch of copies.

03:48:43.44 --> 03:48:46.24
Leadership strategy into act is field manual. The code, the evaluation of the protocol,
