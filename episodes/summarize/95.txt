and I thought that the simplicity of it is pretty clear when you think about it you know when you think about the people that you know you know when I think about the the people that I worked for in the military or that worked for me up or down the chain of command what what is it that made them people that because you know there's bad care you know we we can't sit here and pretend like everybody that's just because you're in the military you've got great character that's absolutely not true but what about those people and I you know I thought through this in in three seconds as this guy asked me this question you know I thought to myself what about the guys that I know that have good character that I look to and say you know I love the history of the greater generation and I love your history as well and the things that are going on today that the guys at the point of the spear but what does that mean to the you know to the average guy you know who's never been in the military there's some principles I believe that the three of us learned in combat that can that's transferable I think to to all challenges of life you know that just you know the fact that you face your fears you know you step into the and to the box and and gymbed it and you've done it where you you could have run the other way you know you you could have quit you could have checked out you do the right thing that's what you do and if you do the right thing regardless of what the consequences are that represents character and so then how do you build character it's a beautiful thing because it's the same thing if you want to build character you do the right thing you do the right thing for yourself you do the right thing for your family you do the right thing for the people that you know you do the right thing for your community you do the right thing for your country that's what you do and now on an individual level those things are hard things often right if those are hard things you have to make the right decisions you have to live a disciplined life those build character those little things that you do on a daily basis to make yourself better to improve your health to improve your your situation in life you're doing those things they're hard to do and when you do those things they build your character and ultimately they lead to your your your your character being a good character as opposed to a bad one and you know what your next mission might be being a good dad right and that might be your next mission you know your next mission might be, it might be building airplane hangers you know you don't know what your next mission is going to be but find out what your next mission is going to be make it something productive make it something that's gonna impact you know at least you and your family and get good at it. and I was looking for a hanger for this airplane and Jim was building hangers at the time and this little bit of airport up in the valley above Santa Barbara called Santinez and he helped me build a hanger and it was kind of interesting the attraction and in fact my wife brought this up me said she said you know you're going to have three generations of warriors talking on these telephone I mean today on the spotcast you get Jim Kunkle on 30 years later you got Charlie Pum 30 years later you got Jack O'Wink he said there's a certain attraction with warriors I don't know what it is with our brains you know I you know I challenge an audience to if you've got it if you know a veteran you know talk to them you know give them a purpose you know invite them to enter into your house your club or your church and it make make a difference and that way you can serve your country by serving those who serve their country but he basically dresses someone down in the middle of a firefight for not giving him you know not calling him sir or not calling him lieutenant and you know I'm kind of saying hey guys you know you need to think about when the right type to do this is but as you said he was an extremely principled person and kept those principles at all times well you know he he led the group of Marines through the night to really fox company which is quite a well-known story in the Marine Corps. I don't know who I have in common you know with Jim or I don't know I have no idea who this was over this picture was going to be so we go to Jim's man cave which is in each equally impressive and awesome you know hanger with you know his personal facts and pictures and models and parts of aircraft and everything else and he walks into a corner but there's some kind of a kind of a magnetism or something you just got identified with a guy that had been in combat and so even though they're probably 100 pilots on this airport and Jim and I kind of hit it off without even knowing our history and the more we got to know each other this is like 20 years ago the more we got to know each other the more similar philosophies of life you know we had but he told me that he came up with two names that he had read this book by Callwell there's a story called the War Dary of JG26 the Elendorf's Abby Vullboy's Elendorf aircraft and they he had written on September 16 he had the story about attacking the three these three seven years group and the Germans claimed 4 p38s had been shot down and that wasn't true I was the only one that lost they actually attacked the group after my engagement with them they finally got their act together I guess in the attack the group and didn't do too well like 20 minutes 30 minutes later whatever the time of them but he figured out that one of two people had shot me down one fellow was major Boris major Boris had shot down his first victory was 1939 he shot down the spitfire he had if he got me I was his 40 second victory the other guy was a no follow by the name of Keith Miela and he he got me I would have been his 80 second so these guys were not beginners and so all this information is dribbling in over the last 60 years so by the time I find out about Boris and the lift wapa they've died so I've never got a chance to talk Wayne Hoffman is an Ellen Dorf Germany in the first part of the SIGFRIED line five o'clock in the evening in his letter to his wife he said in a very short letter he said in the Eleanor and there's an airbile going on above us and we get talking and that was me then here we've been friends for a number of years and we'd never really talked about it and he was company D of the 16th regiment and when it's got was company C of the 16th regiment and we never put all this together that's it's amazing what comes out and I found out that two of the people on the German side that I've been involved with a current major Boris this is a long story I don't know how far do you want to go with we go as long as you want to talk they major Boris allowed to go back and step I heard from a gentleman in Holland and they had some information about my airplane and this gentleman had written several big historical books and he lived in that little area where Belgium and Holland and Germany all come together and he had found like 500 wrecks aircraft wrecks in this area and traced them down in the history and recorded it and they came up with a P38 in Elendorf Germany and so they figured out and found it was my airplane and they found it in 1997 this this person I trust you know without question what kind of person is that that's the person that you know is going to do the right thing all the time regardless of the consequences and a couple of things about that first of all it isn't easy in fact usually the right thing is the toughest thing you know it and I spotted them and it called the break and made the break and squadron kept on going and the break is you're saying hey I'm going to break off from the squadron right now or someone needs to come with me or we need to face this other issue over here we got a bunch of enemy aircraft coming that's what that's what calling the break is call your break you know when you call the break they whoever spotted the aircraft leads the break because you don't want to lose them you can't take if you see them you got to keep your eyeball on them or you're gonna lose them but when you're talking to guys they're ready to go and he day commences they just don't you know they don't they don't understand what they're getting into yet and and again maybe to the credit of the planners they decided it's better to have a bunch of guys that aren't really 100% sure of what to expect and it is to have a bunch of people that know what they're getting into and know how hard this is gonna be. and yet it's those kinds of challenges in life that build that character you know that that really make the difference between you know that the the positive life the life lived well and those guys and gals that that don't make those kind of decisions and you're talking about when you were when you were depressed when you were laying there it's because you felt like you had failed right you felt like you had broken you felt like you weren't the man that you thought you were and the 38's and because they were so easy to recognize in the air we were assigned the channel we we flew top cover for the channel all the shipping and everything between England and the beachhead and we at that time it became very apparent that the reason we had been rushed into through training into England is they anticipated heavy losses we expected they lived off the really show during the invasion they didn't I think you read that there were just I think they had two sorties over the beachhead on D-Day and we anticipated that there would be a large effort against the the channel with all the shipping I mean you could probably walk across the channel with a number of ships there were there uh this tremendous target the foothold didn't show up so most of the like my group the the day missions were pretty boring when D-Day was about to go I mean it's every single person you guys must have absolutely known that what you were about to do was that was you know going to be the one of the most epic undertakings of the modern history Well I would assume that because they were very effective and you know some of these boys you we'd run into who had been out of for a long time but as I saw them coming in and as we'd forgive them as I said it's a gaggle I picked the one closest and broke into it made the call that I was making the break and broke and just as I broke somebody got a shot at me and I got hit back in the after all part of the few slides and I I thought I had a little fire going and I'm sure I did and then he told me a lot about what happened they they told me that they estimated there were 20 and 20 enemy aircraft and that somehow or other that story has stuck with with my story I don't know what they were I mean he he actually was where I got most of my information about what had gone on so we we went through the hospital chain and you know what was he in the hospital for something had he been injured as well the the violent piece I mean you could apply that to really many situations in life where you know we see people and they're they're in a bad position in life they need to do something violent to move out of that situation not just there and wait for something to unfold that was not only air combat that's interesting about watching the exhaust because you'd see a change that like a plume come out of the exhaust or you see the exhaust cut off and you'd know what type of maneuver they were going to do he's trying to pull a fast one and you have to power off and you overrun him and he shoots you down but I used to build air cargo buildings and so forth and leasing to the airlines and I did a lot of work with flying tigers and I knew Bob Prescott pretty well who was the president of tigers and they who Wayne Hoffman who was the chairman of the board of tigers so tell us a little bit about the flying tigers if people don't know the flying tigers in the airline cargo airline that was sold to federal express then is now part of federal express and tigers was named because Bob Prescott he was president of tigers had flown with the flying tiger organization in China one of the original flying tigers and right after the war he started a little airline called it flying tigers and it became a gigantic air cargo facility and they were flying all over the world D Day at the long to those youngsters what was the because these these guys were so you know we're inexperienced when you were out at a pub in England talking to these army guys that were getting ready to go in were they just a hundred percent fired up to go I mean that's the only thing because I can imagine myself when I was 18 or 19 years old I first was in the military if you would have told me I was going to do a giant amphibious landing an epic amphibious landing there would have been just nothing but absolute motivation and excitement from me because I was young and stupid and didn't know any better and and there's a certain silent language I think between us that we don't even have to talk to each other and yet we understand what what's going on you know where we're coming from and the accountability that we share just because of the experiences that we've had I got asked the question the other day I was working with a company I was actually know it's in the court with a company I was doing a speech And actually, that, now that I think about it, when I was in Ramadi, I had the book that I read every night was about face by Colonel David Hackworth and I read it every single night, every single night, and then about three months into deployment, I wanted to, I didn't want to think about, you know, I didn't want to go to bed thinking about, you know, the war and war. you said it's all the other idiots that broke their leg riding motor scooters in Hawaii and sure enough all these military guys in this military hospital had broken their leg on motor scooters and so I said I can't do that I'm a fighter pilot you know I just to help start the top gun school I gotta I gotta get out of here you know you're like wait how come this happened you know you're in denial and the guy said okay report to uh wing uh bravo uh floor three I said what's on bravo three thanks for bringing that up Jim you know let's let's do we're talking about now we're talking about getting shot down you know you're ended up in a prison camp let's you you were about to get to the to the engagement or you actually did get shot down you want to talk through that one a little bit further Jim and just give us some details on that. but the camaraderie of military guys you know that there's just something and a lot of stuff that you talk about Jack O in your podcast and then your books just the you know the fact that we're all accountable we're responsible not just for our lives with for our buddies and something about that that community of warriors that really connects so that's how Jim and I got started to be built to hang her for me and and I moved in my wife made a man cave out of it you know I was I was talk about the fact that when I joined the Navy it was 1990 and I just missed the first Gulf War and like I was completely dismayed by that because you know there hadn't been a war since basically since Vietnam so it'd been 20 years and I'm thinking okay there was there was my shot to fight in the war and I just missed it and and your listeners may think that the three of us you know have always you know been on the top of the heap but all three of us have fallen short you know It's still, you know, the challenges I faced were the challenges that, you know, that a single mother trying to make ends meet makes, you know, the frustration and the loneliness and the lack of confidence and the feeling that you're not measuring up. that's interesting having having jumped out of at least a decent number of airplanes this is not something you want to do for the first time you know I remember thinking well you know I got to be ready to move and when I get down so I unbuckled the two lower straps on the shoe I think we should talk a little bit about philosophies of combat and the fears that we faced because I think you know to the general public the vast majority of your listeners and viewers are not in the military and so you know my my thought is well how do they relate I mean these gals were just unbelievable how they took care of you know it's actually you know we've read some books on the podcast where there is nurses that were over in France and they were receiving guys right off the front lines and so what I said I can't do that I gotta go back to the ship he said you said you can't ride around on a ship of the broken leg I said no an aircraft carry we've got hospital is the next ray of machines and all this good stuff we had doctors and surgeons and all this stuff but they were looking for they brought a lot of troops that didn't have any combat experience I don't think five percent of the people that hit the beaches have experience you know as funny I got in trouble in Paris a few years out of your good now this is a good story my wife can hear it she was there in fact well the next thing I hear is the engines of the ship starting up you know we're about to leave now meanwhile my squadron buddies you know one need to leave no man behind says where's Charlie they went back on the beach searching for me for the last place they saw me was disappearing towards diamond head on a vespas and so they look all over for me and come back and report that I'm a wall yeah stay off we had that same philosophy and all my seal puttunes and seal task you know it's stay off the radio and now you're trying you know we're doing ground support they give us coordinates on the chart now you're going to go out and find it with the so when I got here you know we're walking around and and Jim's hangers a few hangers down and you know you said hey Jim wants to show you something and that's just a that's delineating that these guys are working with the ground troops and you're flying low and the dream of aerial combat is not so much there right now it's not right now the glimer force has got the all the you guys must have been all ears though I mean you talked about screwball but but the RAF pilots that had fought the battle of Britain I mean did you guys getting lessons learned from them and and were they actually directly teaching you guys at all they talked to us we didn't have any formal instruction from them the conversations and usually at the bar at the O club or officers club as we called it but you know we we were quite close for just a few weeks and for years and years and years I tried to find Leonard Scott I knew that he made it through the war I knew that he'd gotten all separated from active duty and at Fort Lewis and he was from the Dalsor I didn't and I tried to find him and about a year ago my wife said down at the computer in an amount of a couple hours she finds his two his two daughters and he had passed he'd gone through Korea went back on active duty went through Korea but normally we carry two 500s I like the thousand because the bigger the bang is the less chance you have to go back and do it again and when you went back to do it again they're waiting for you so up until that point that was kind of your primary mission that was going in and hitting railway stations or new nation's factories are in reconnaissance anything that moved and if you're good and finding a thing you moved you try to shoot the insulators all the high tension lines so any anything you could get we there was no problem finding targets and different from the eight there of course we were over the target area in a relatively short time so they were shooting at you most of the time how long did you how long did you arrive in England before D-Day actually happened? You know, the accountability issue, the, the face your fears issue, the making choices issue, the refusal to blame other people if you're a problem, you know, take control of your life and it's just not just a military thing. and so you know to me that's sort of the important part the part that you can you can transfer more than just the military history that we all have the the philosophy of meeting challenges because I'm convinced you know you can you can you can be in just as much of a challenge in your life you don't you don't have to be flying jet airplanes or running around the seal teams you can face challenges when a person is diagnosed with cancer or loses a child or for that matter gets cut out of your land on the freeway you have a choice and and the choice that you make that certainly depends on not only your character And the fact that you get around, you're friends, and that's what a lot of people that listen to podcasts, a lot of veterans that listen to podcasts, they go, you know, now, you know, I've had my break, but now you're talking about this stuff you know Charlie you're you know the modern rigs where you pull the ejection handle and you this is all stuff I mean in a modern aircraft you pull the ejection handle and you're getting shot out of the aircraft all automatic that's all that's all you do you know puts on a golf shirt and goes out and tries to reconnect with people and it Jim is what you were talking about you know being in civilian clothes and Paris and you you were looking for some way to reconnect with with your unit and ironically here they come marching down the Champs-Alysée that Alito and and there you were back in uniform and and so you and you had a wrestling dattra I I I failed to hear I didn't do what I was supposed to do I lacked the character that I needed at that time to to be a good leader or to even stand up and fight one more time I failed and the point is also sitting around at this table and every single person that's listening to this right now you can find a spot in your life where you said you know what I didn't do it so so I get a cab I got this cast on now from my way stall went down on my toe got a big toes I mean I broke my ankle you know not not the rest of my leg what if I you need you need a pilot from the squadron to run the the amateness on a cuby point and Philippines you know a pilot stand behind it for battle damage and stuff you know and so they said okay we're going to you got your cast and they took the big cast off and put a small one on and say we're going to send you to England for at least 30 days to a flycouse well flycouses were they run by the red cross and mainly were for bomber crews if the bomber crew had been getting a little nervous of something that sent them down for a week or
