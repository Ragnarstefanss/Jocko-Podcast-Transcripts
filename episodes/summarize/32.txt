You know you're instructors you know recognize you as a black belt you are a black belt regardless and just because you jump back on the wave of jujitsu and maybe weren't as good as surfing you know you're still you're still that black belt you just got it like I said you just got to get refresh with all the new techniques if you want to you know be up to. And you know some of the stereotypes that that you might see out there Like like like like for instance men or tougher than women or men or women or women are more emotional than men That's just garbage and if you see I've seen At least when you get to a leadership position I've definitely seen women that were way tougher than then guys were in terms of hey we got to make this move for the company Here's what I'm gonna do boom they executed and I've seen men that were way too emotional and attached to Is this scenario and ruin it because they're just the way more emotional than the stereotypical woman might be so that's why I just didn't think you can trust them I look at a person I weathered a man or woman. I feel that all the time Just gotta like fight your tongue Right, but I think that's that's a real compelling like desire, you know to To show hey, already know that or look how much I know you know I make a What he does really well is he makes people talk and he you know I've heard him get some criticism for You know, let's say he's got like a Religious guy on there and he doesn't believe in religion But he'll let that person talk about religion and won't like jump on him and get in their face and say you know I think that your way of training should be Done or performed with kids as well like parents with their kids you know how you because you know how the Kid the kids miss behaving and the parents like I don't know why he does that I told him not to pitch a fit But you know what I remember when I sit long time ago where I was like, yeah, you know, I don't know No, I don't mind oh, you don't like boss. and we're gonna move on Yeah, that that showing off knowledge thing that that that it's in a micromanagement situation It seems like okay, it's obviously shouldn't do that and you can probably see it from a malo But but just in everyday life, that's a compelling thing to want to show people you ever Ever hear someone telling you something that you already know and you just want to tell them I already know I don't think there's anything false about saying hey I am not good enough to be a black belt right now so therefore I'm putting on I think I'm about purple belt level I know it feels like to be a black belt and I don't feel like one right now and he gets her in a choke he gets her in a rear naked choke and she berries her chin like a white belt like a like a defense you know I'm very much in so he's not going to talk me he chokes her face like I'm talking legit gets after it. But like is that is that like you know as far as like can you do that or what I do how do you feel about that I don't know but that would be very cool to see that happen. and it it does seem like a real like personal like deeply personal thing like because it it's like it's more and I'm like like I got that 60 hours 60 hours worth of worth of Conversation with you and me and so absolutely people start feeling like You know, hey, oh, So just take one of those hours yeah or take maybe 10% of that money that you're spending or 25% all of it Whatever and put it in something that you anticipate in the other thing is I mean Investing yourself is like actually build something actually build a little company You know make something that's what that that's what I was meant you've got another perspective Which is also very viable and makes just as much sense I was literally talking about you know From your perspective. so That's what you're gonna do you want to you want to get your money taken care of you want to you want to have financial freedom You got to just have the financial discipline that's that's all there is to it and work hard You know or card make things happen, but your your major gains You know most people don't become rich by their salary I mean people can fall in and out of that mindset in that trap you know where it's like I just want that that belt I want to walk around and be known as a black belt or whatever and then that mindset starts to just creep in their mind and it becomes like a major part of their thinking.
