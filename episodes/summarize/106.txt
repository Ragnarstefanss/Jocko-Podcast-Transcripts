okay there you go back to the book Sudanese and Gwen are agree that it was not long after this at the Alph the commander of Alphacompanese missing second platoon lieutenant Gordon Grove staggered into the American position from the east here's Larry going talking I saw Gordon Gordon Gordon Grove coming across the field along with two wounded men they were the only ones left of this platoon who could move Grove was distraught we got him and his two men with us and our got our men ex working on the wounded then Gordon asked for men to go back with him to get his people Joe Shadini's said Gordon I can't send anybody about else back out there it was clear that to leave this perimeter was deaf everywhere you looked you could see north Vietnamese Gordon asked for permission to go talk to the battalion commander so Jeanne said go ahead he jogged over asked me to aid for help to get his men got a negative response so he came back to our handheld so this is one of those classic examples you hear about all time people will try and get you in the the catch twenty two question like the got you question what what would you do if you were in the situation and you some of you guys were still out there but you didn't have enough people to go get him or you were being overwhelmed what would you do well here's what these guys did right here they'll know you can't go get him if you send in more people out there they're gonna die if they did if we send 10 guys out there 15 guys out there 18 guys out there to go recover the splin we're gonna lose 18 more guys we're gonna stay put we're in fight as best we can from here we'll get fire superiority back we'll get our shit together and then we'll go get these guys go in ads there was a tremendous battle going on in the vicinity of where we had come into the clearing and beyond there in the jungle it was Charlie company caught in the killing zone of the ambush fighting for its life the mortar fire had ceased the enemy tubes apparently had been overrun by Charlie company because we found them all the next day but there were still hundreds of North Vietnamese calmly walking around the area we were observing now began the sniping phase of our battle I call it that because for a long period of time all we did was pick off enemy wandering around our perimeter and this last until we started getting air support everything that had happened to this point had probably taken less than 30 minutes Gwen saw major frank Henry the batalion executive officer lying on his back using the radio trying desperately to get some tactical air support and succeeding the air was on the way but there was no artillery or aerial rocket artillery yet Jim Spires the S3 ran over to us and queried Gordon Grove Gordon Grove as the situation outside the perimeter where he had just come from Grove told him there were still men out there tightened into a small perimeter but they were all wounded and dying and the radio has had all been knocked out Captain Spires asked a second time if he thought anyone would still alive and none of us said anything Gwen climbed up top a termite hill and began sniping at the North Vietnamese visible across the clearing in the trees to the south with Xem 16 rifle there were plenty of targets and I remember picking off 10 or 15 NVA from my position my memories revolve around the way in which each enemy soldier fell that I hit someone simply limp slump limply to the ground some reacted as if they had been hit by a truck some that I missed on the first and second shots kept on milling around until I finally hit them what we did not know at the time was that they were wandering around the elephant grass looking for Americans who were still alive and killing them off one by one North Vietnamese soldiers climbed into trees and on top of those brush covered termite hills and poured fire down on the cavalry troops troopers trapped in the tall grass below them in the main body of the column there was serious firing including mortar fire both from both sides the strike at the head of the column was followed so quickly by the enemy encircling assaults that the whole business seemed to erupt almost simultaneously without doubt some of some platoons of mixtades battalion were alert and in as secure a formation as they could achieve in the elephant grass brush and fix scrub trees but the visibility problem made it difficult to maintain formation and one result was that American troop for closer to one another then was tactically sound providing juicy granite juicy targets for a grenade mortar round or a burst from AK 47 rifle all down the column platoon leaders sergeants radio operators and riflemen by the dozens were killed or wounded in the first 10 minutes rapidly degrading communication cohesion and control to this whole thing that we've talked about up in this poem is like a half an hour just a brutal onslaught that kicked off with massive violence of action Captain Fesmire adds the result was very intense individual hand to hand combat in the confusion I had no idea exactly where the company was located when lieutenant cornet died it was virtually impossible for me to talk to anyone in my company the battle had clearly become an individual struggle for life again that was the goal of the Vietnamese was to make it an individual struggle was to get in close was to separate people from the main battalion to split it up into as many parts as possible so they could pick it apart. and we need to put you back on back and back on the fight back to the book specialist john willenus bravo company mortar observer was doing some serious celebrating he had not only survived x-ray without a scratch but this day November 18 was his birthday I was 22 years old we were fed and showered new clothes were available I spent the afternoon at the men's at the enlisted men's club drinking beer with a well tuned exchanging stories and celebrating my birthday around 4 p.m. to dyric came in and told us to saddle up we were going to rescue the battalion out about 1600 hours lieutenant Rick rest score a recalls captain dyric walked up get the company together battalion's catching health we may have to go in you're the only patoon leader left in the company help all the patoons get their shit together men spilled out of the clubs and doubled time to their equipment they worked quickly throwing on their harnesses no protests but their eyes filled with disbelief again dyric then issued the the shortest frag order in bravo company history will be landing from the southeast open fired anything on your left run to your right a hostile landing with one side of the landing zone held by the north Vietnamese sit rep from the ground grim expect to be sandwiched between friendly and enemy fires at about 545 p.m. rest scorela gathered the patoons they pressed in close listening intently for word sergeant first class oldston oldston the mortar patoon sergeant sergeant staff sergeant martin speck for Vincent specialist walinas the towering sergeant Larry Milton 80 or more young faces hollow eyes you know the patangin is in the shit I said we have been selected to jump into that shit and pull them out if you fight like you did at x-ray you'll come through it stay together come out of those choppers ready to get it on across the field the first lift ships were sweeping in head him up captain direct grout I turned and walked ahead fantino trailing with the PRC 25 the road stretched out past the permanent hooches of the rear echelon at hallaway word spread that we were on a suicide fight tumbling out of cozy bunks hallways finest line the road to watch us depart Hawaiian shirts, aviator shades jeans, beer cans and hands cooks and bottle washers the shit burgers, projectionists club runners same army different species the company picked up pace a tight dirty brown column a few of the men carried eight k's trophies from x-ray no one had shaved noted risk orla but our weapon sparkled one out fit are you one spectator asked the hard core of bravo company second of the seventh where you headed to kick ass a yelled back a deep rumble ran through the ranks men yelling cursing not a man among us with swap places with these lardasses as we passed I asked fantino how we looking back there his reply no straggler sir every swing and dick is with us as we made a column right to the pickup point I looked back at our crew no outfit in the army had ever rendered a route step any better than these men at this moment we piled on to the huge without the usual loading instructions and skated away into the fading gray light at 645 p.m. the first lift ships roared into the small Albany clearing and captain to direct troopers bailed out into the tall grass the cavalry had ridden to the rescue but the killing and dying and terror continued unbated inside the american perimeter as the long night began once again that's the american soldier right there barely survived x-ray get called to go back in and they pick up the pace back to the book captain to direct road of the flight in in the situation on the ground assaulting Albany we picked up five bullet holes in the helicopter things were bad I found out what I landed that the battalion was shot up pretty bad so we came in the nica time to their rescue the main part of second battalion seventh calves was on their last ditch standard Albany little big horn revisited and here's rescor la talking looking sideways Now most of the battalions men from those two battalions had landed at LZ Victor which was about two miles away from X-ray and they had patrolled to X-ray on foot arriving for the most part without incident and then things seemed to settle down or a lot of next-ray one seven left and once one seven had left the battlefield two seven and two five were still there so at that point that portion of the battle was over and two seven and two five could have likely been extracted via helicopter pretty securely just at one seven had been it seems that general west moorland did not like the idea of two seven and two five pulling out he thought that that would appear as a retreat so he ordered that two five and two seven secure LZ X-ray for the night and then the next day they would move by foot patrol to another LZ called LZ Albany which was about two point five miles to the north and then B-50-U bombers were going to rain down bombs on LZ X-ray and the surrounding areas they didn't expect a lot of resistance because things had settled somewhat down so much on LZ X-ray that if you remember even towards the end of the last podcast there was reporters came in and landed in LZ X-ray and were doing camera shots and interviewing people so it was pretty settled down they felt like it was over and they didn't expect much resistance on this movement from LZ X-ray to LZ Albany so let's go back to the book the book is We Were Soldiers once and Young by General Halmore and Joe Galaway and like I said there wasn't much resistance expected and here's what it says in the book the word among Bob McDades troopers was that it was going to be a walk in the sun a stroll over to another landing zone where the helicopters would come in and extract them the first leg of the journey home to on K-Base the word was wrong and these guys even though there hadn't been much fighting going on they were actually a little bit tired because they had been awake on the ground so here we go just before Alpha Company second battalion moved out it's commander captain Joe Sadini's put out an unusual order his executive officer Lieutenant Larry Gwyn who we're going to let hear a lot from Lieutenant Larry Gwyn remembers it well the company had been on 100% alert for over 52 hours we were in such a state of exhaustion that captain Sadini's directed that each man take two APC tablets aspirin with caffeine a move designed to increase the mental alertness of the troops so there you go take a little caffeine little aspirin get you guys get your heads in the game because they've been awake for a long time and again they're not expecting much but they still put on the ground you know hop LZ for a while back to the book Lieutenant Ali the battalion's communication officer was with headquarters company we were told that this would be a tactical move there was a lot of stuff on the battlefield equipment supplies captured stuff that had to be police to up and blown up all in a hurry up situation and so here they give a kind of an overview of what's going on here it is this is what back to the book this is what was happening Sudanese alphar company was moving forward toward the albany clearing so they've they've now a pro they're kind of approached this this LZ Albany that's what they're talking about the albany clearing um alphar company the sygini's alphar company was moving toward the albany clearing Colonel McDade and his batain command group were with alphar company the other company commanders had left their companies under orders and were moving up to join McDade for a conference so the other company commanders are not with their companies anymore the batain was strong out along the line of march for a distance of at least 550 yards so half a kilometer the men of delta company were lulling around on the ground Charlie company had flankers off to each side but were mostly taking a break sitting or lying down George forus men at the tail of the column were in a wedge formation and also had flank security posted the men of batain were worn out after nearly 60 hours without sleep and four hours of marching through difficult terrain visibility in the chest high elephant grass was very limited that situation to be in here's lieutenant going talking we had been there a short time five minutes when i heard some rounds fired near our first platoon i thought they must have caught up with those NVA stragglers then everything opened up opened up the firing just crescendoed they hadn't found the stragglers they had run right into the north Vietnamese i was out in the grass away from the trees when it started the rounds were so fast and for years overhead they were knocking bark off the trees i ran to them one round struck the tree i was crouch next to and inch over my head i said holy shit and ran to join Joel we all got down then i heard the sickening whump of mortar fire landing where i had seen our second platoon disappear the most savage one day battle of the Vietnam war had just begun the second battalion seventh cavalry had walked into a hornet's nest the north Vietnamese reserve force the 550 man eight battalion 66 regimen had been bivouacct in the woods off to the northeast of nicknades column so you've got fresh soldiers that had been waiting they were the reserves that whole earlier battle in the hydrang with the one seven calf this this Vietnamese group the 66 regimen eight battalion 66 regimen had been waiting in reserve and now they just so happened to be in the line of march where these uh where the two five is coming through or sorry the two seven is coming through here's what Colonel Anne who again this was the Vietnamese commander here's what he had to say i think this fight of November 17th was the most important of the entire campaign i gave the order to my battalions when you meet the americans divide yourself into many groups and attack the column from all directions and divide the column into as many pieces move inside the column grab them by the belt and thus avoid casualties from the artillery and air we had some advantages now for let me just talk about that one real quick and you know you just become hard to understand what you're screaming yelling calm down get their attention give simple clear concise direction of what you want back to the book each and every man still alive on that field american and north Vietnamese was fighting for his life in the tall grass it was nearly impossible for the soldiers of either side to identify front or fro except it extremely close range americans in all of drab and north Vietnamese and mustard brown were fighting and dying side by side it may have begun as a meeting engagement a hasty ambush a surprise attacked a battle of maneuver and in fact it was all those things but within minutes the result was a wild melee a shootout with just gun fighters killing not only the enemy not only the enemy but sometimes their friends just a few feet away there would be no cheap victory here this day for either side there would be no victory at all just a horrible certainty of death in the tall grass unbelievable horrible horrible back to the book just for the headquarter section of the column Charlie company was beginning to die Charlie company talking about Charlie company a whole company of men 150 guys spec for jacksmith was with the lead elements in the Charlie company formation nearly tenet dawn cornet the acting company commander when the company charged into the teeth of the enemy machine guns in the first seconds smith saw one of the radio operators fall dead with a bullet through his chest his eyes and tongue bulging out the men of Charlie company were firing in all directions smith recalls within a span of perhaps 20 minutes everyone around me was dead or wounded except me you have to understand that an area the elephant grass was chest high once you hit the dirt your world was about as big as a dining room table your world's completely confined to that area and the six or seven men around you at that point we were isolated alpha company was in the same shape then the north Vietnamese swept through I believe they came between alpha and our company began to shoot people we didn't know if the noise was from five feet away as they began to shoot people was friendly or enemy smith saw soldiers take machine guns lie flat on the ground and begin firing into the grass often they were firing right into the muscles of other American machine guns people were screaming to stop the shooting it began to have all the elements of a massacre nobody was in control because all the officers were to the front and our radio operators had fallen dead on their radio sets no leadership no communication and they actually did the madmen it which is something that Hacworth talks about and it's something that they did in the first part of this book which is hey everyone in the perimeter is just going to shoot a bunch of rounds like at 630 in the morning boom everyone fire a full load out or a full magazine or a couple magazines at likely targets and they did that and that seemed to calm things down they kind of did that once things had already calm down a little bit and it was it was it indicated that maybe things were calming down a little here's another thing back to the book the NBA came into the ambush area that night to recover their dead wounded when they found any of our guys alive they would beat them to death bayonet them or machete them to avoid shooting and drawing fire from us that was during the night they did that like I said they did the madmen and here's what here's what Lieutenant Riscordla said about the madmen and he said this decision was regrettable rifle fire shattered the silence and the perimeter was wring with reckless firing little fought had been given to that the remainder of our survivors were sprawled among the trees and ant hills within 500 yards the effective range of RM16s what the fuck is happening are you shooting at us the frantic radio call started coming in how many troops were killed or injured by our wake up call will never be known thank God for the trees the ant hills and the uneven terrain captain Dudley to Demy third brigade fire support coordinator remembers flying out to Albany at first light the next morning Tim Brown myself Mickey Parrish took a while to get through the smoke hanging over the whole area not much had really taken place in terms of policing the area the image is still vivid in my mind is the carnage folks were still sitting around in a days they hadn't done much had even taken ponchos and covered up these bodies I could handle the conversation I could handle grown men crying but we were talking 12 hours later sitting there feeling sorry for themselves Colonel Brown was very pissed off even if you do get caught in a bad situation you have to do something to recover it was young kids who paid the price in later years I used to stress that to my young battery commanders it isn't us who die in combat it's those young kids who die those kids we are responsible for training and leading it's our job to get the job done and get those kids home safe and here they're wrapping up this again now this the battle turned and really the Vietnamese left after the massive air strikes it started and here's another image of the cleanup back to the book specialist for John Molinas of Bravo Company second battalion seventh cavalry mortapal tune and most of the rest of Djeric's men were involved in this macabre depressing duty it was incredible carnage we went into areas where lots of artillery had come in during the night and we saw our guys have been blown up in the trees the bodies were already decomposed and it only happened night before we were in shock it was the first last and only time I ever saw anything like it and then you realize what happened so so that's what's going on here split forces things are going crazy now here we go acrimans back to the book acrimans recomplitude leader lieutenant pain he says all hell broke loose up along the north side of the lz i turned to my right and observed some american soldiers moving toward the northwest to set up positions and they went down in a hail of bullets within minutes we were all under heavy attack and my radio operator and i were pinned down in the middle of the lz with the most of the fire with most of the fire coming from the north and north west lieutenant pain's radio opera came alive as the alpha company platoon leaders reported heavy fighting pain says mortar rounds began falling which was a new experience to everyone since we had never had any kind of mortar fire against us the noise level was unbelievable i remember pressing my body flatter against the ground and i have ever been in my life and thinking that certainly the highest thing sticking up were my heels mortars continue to fall in small arms and machine gun fire continue to hectic pace finally my mind seemed to adjust and i once again began to think about the situation we were in and what we were going to do so you see there's a leader he's pinned down and this is something that the the insurgents and i rack would do as well they're going to hit you with multiple different weapon systems you know in a combined coordinated attack so if you can imagine if you start hitting people with mortars well everyone needs to get down you need to get down you need to take cover wall you're taking cover that's that's cover they're going to move they're going to maneuver in they're going to maneuver in with with heavy weapons or they're going to move maneuver in with an assault squad or they're going to maneuver in with a vehicle born i ed yeah it is loud and clear tell these businesses were like going talk to businesses they talk about this problem and that problem the other problem the problem is leadership that's the problem is the problem is leadership and the situation like this where the leaders are not there to lead you've got serious problems on your hands especially once again if you haven't trained people to lead to step up and lead when the leader's gone if you haven't trained people to do that you're gonna have problems no one is going to lead back to the book pain fought the north Vietnamese had done a much much better job of anticipating and preparing for the attack but the Americans who survived the initial onslaught began to rally in one respect you could think of it as little big horn we were surrounded with our packs in front of us shooting it out during the course of that long afternoon I never saw soldier not do his duty I never saw anyone who cowered in the face of the enemy our backs were against the wall and it was a matter of survival every person I saw rose to the occasion so this is the American troopers are doing what American troopers do fight even in these terrible situation no one cowers no one stands down back to the book shortly after word the command came over the batangin net throw smoke lieutenant Gwen moved a little way into the grass and the men in Albany perimeter all began to throw smoke grenades I saw skip fuzzmire Charlie company commander throwing smoke I had no idea what the hell he was doing up here our perimeter was marked with colors with all colors of smoke delineating our positions and shortly after the air strikes started they were the they were eight one east sky raiders with napom the first napom canisters fell right at the point where sajini's and i had left the jungle and came into the clearing we could see masses of north Vietnamese on the other side I was sure I was very sure they were going to come across at us but we've got wounded Americans on the ground we're going to get them everyone in the unit volunteers we only need two aircraft guess what we're bringing for back to the book after midnight several shots rang out from inside the perimeter a trooper 20 yards behind risk gorilla inside the perimeter had rattled off a panicky three rounds risk gorilla walked back and cost out the group in the middle of perimeter if I hear one more round out of you we'll turn our weapons around and open up no one fires from inside the perimeter if you want to fire out to the perimeter if you want to fire get out to the perimeter line whispered communication took place all night between isolated elements outside the perimeter if there was heroism it was out there in the tiny groups of wounded and those who had bandaged and protected them through the night they were just like hunting buddies said risk gorilla surviving by instinct looking out for each other lieutenant Larry going a valve company recalls that late that night one of Alpha's missing men crawled into the American perimeter here's what he says sergeant James a malarty from our first platoon made it back to our lines his story the NVA had been shooting our wounded one came up to him stuck a pistol in his mouth and fired the bullet exited through the back of his throat knocked him out and they left him for dead he survived and when he woke up that night he started crawling to us the next day was a real nightmare as we went out to find our dead in missing I think each of us cracked up a little bit that day as the true picture of the action began to unfold then it came across the radio Bravo company had found another survivor from our second platoon he had been badly wounded in the legs and it prop himself up against a tree he had been burned by napalm waiting in the night and some north Vietnamese had put a pistol to his eye and pulled the trigger shot him in the eye blinded him this is gives the guys on the battlefield incredible flexibility to execute that plan we had some advantages on continuing we had some advantages we attacked your column from the sides at the moment of attack we were waiting for you this was our reserve battalion and they were just waiting for their turn the eight battalion had not been used in fighting in this campaign they were fresh spec for dick acumen was the right flank point man in the recon platoon which was itself the point of the battalion says acumen we were going to the left to a clearing we had gone about a hundred feet when he heard some shots then more shots and finally all hell broke loose the main brunt of the attack was right where we had been standing just a few minutes before we hit the dirt i was laying in the middle of a clearing and bullets were kicking dirt in my eyes and breaking off the grass acumen's first sergeant was standing shouting and giving directions his shirt was off and he was in a t-shirt he lifted his left arm to point and i could see were a bullet and ripped them ripped open the side of his arm and part of the side of his chest he was still giving orders we were then ordered to another part of the circle that was weak it was facing the main area of attack there were people running everywhere we couldn't just open fire in that direction because our guys were there we were on semi automatic and picking off whoever we could be sure of as a target so this just turns into immediately into chaos and again this is why consolidation of your forces is so important because the minute you have enemy in between you and other friendly forces your field of fire is completely shut off and you're likely when you are pulling the trigger you have a good chance you're going to shoot some of your own guys so that's again why consolidation of forces is very very important now i say this all the time i'll make the caveat again are there times where you can get away with with splitting your forces and there are other times that it makes sense yes absolutely there are times that it makes sense and we did all kinds of operations overseas where we had different units out on the battlefield that were split up and maneuvering from different areas we did all the time and if you'd been if you'd said go right well you'd great made the greatest call ever because the enemy was over there waiting for again you don't know where the enemy's gonna be don't have that luxury so sometimes you make the best tactical decision you can make and it turns out bad now we can look back at this hindsight being 2020 of course and and critique what's about to happen so we'll we'll we'll talk a little bit more about it here's what goes down back to the book Captain George Forest commander of Alpha Company first baton fifth cavalry was more than 500 yards to the rear so these guys are in a long column of march group of people middaydast all the company commanders to come forward so middaydast the company is the baton commander he tells all the companies commanders to come forward so he's middayd's up at the front of this column and who knows how big they are you know he says he's 500 yards the rear of this whole thing probably spanned out probably six 700 maybe even 800 meters we're getting close to a kilometer in length of people to spread out just so everyone understands it's hard to control 40 guys in a in a line of march with any kind of control that spread out over 200 meters that's challenging you get 500 600 guys spread out over almost a kilometer we have a serious command and control issue so now what he's doing to overcome this issue is telling all the all the company commanders so there's three companies that are out there actually there's more than that it would explain that whole thing to me I just say because that's the value that I got way the warrior kid if you want a longer explanation you can email echo he'll give it to you extreme ownership same thing combat leadership for business in life

far go war stuff and by the way the enemy gets a vote the enemy gets a vote the enemy can do things like this that you don't expect the enemy can hit you from multiple sides the enemy can have a strategy to get or attack to getting close that's what the enemy is going to do you don't know what the enemy is going to do actually you don't know what they're going to do you don't know they're going to have mortars this time back to the book lieutenant Colonel McDade himself recalls when things began happening I got in without for company so I used my band at my fingers and someone else is too old when it was available the comfort of a trench just big enough to hold your body is unbelievable no more than 200 yards away in that tortured column of desperate Americans one man prayed for a miracle and the US Air Force delivered it pfc Jim shaden delta company who had booby trapped his own body with a hand grenade was badly wounded an unable unable to move he was directly in the path of a group of north Vietnamese soldiers methodically sweeping the ground killing his wounded buddies then here's what he says before the north Vietnamese got to me half a dozen of them a pilot came over at treetop level level turned straight up and dropped the canister of napalm dead center on them i never cease to be a mage amazed at the accuracy of that drop the heat of the napalm rolled across my face and body like an open door on a furnace i owe this pilot more than it is possibly possible for a human to pay may god bless all pilots now we hear from captain abuse tally's bravo company first battalion fifth cavalry was a was assigned the mission of attacking to relieve the pressure and attempt to link up with the beleaguered battalion refreend forcements were also on the way for the battalion command perimeter at the head of the column during the afternoon captain miranda dyrics battle weary veterans of the fight at landing zone x-ray bravo company second battalion seventh cab got a warning to prepare for a night aerosol into a hot landing zone the bravo company troopers delighted to have survived the hellish fighting on x-ray and enjoying a well deserved rest and a lot of cold beer back at camp hollow
