00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.68
This is Jocko podcast number 347 with echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:03.68 --> 00:00:05.68
Jocko willing. Good evening echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:07.92 --> 00:00:09.04
Simply put,

4
00:00:09.04 --> 00:00:12.48
warn officer Nick Lavery is a warrior's warrior.

5
00:00:14.24 --> 00:00:19.28
Nick selflessly and repeatedly risked his life for his nation as comrades in arms and most

6
00:00:19.28 --> 00:00:25.60
importantly, he accomplished what our nation needed him to do every time he left our shores.

7
00:00:25.60 --> 00:00:34.80
Nick is a hero in the truest sense. Nick's chosen profession requires an immersion

8
00:00:35.92 --> 00:00:42.16
into some of the nation's most difficult challenges, often in demanding, complex,

9
00:00:42.16 --> 00:00:49.44
and especially uncertain environments. To answer the nation's call, we seek men and women who have

10
00:00:49.44 --> 00:00:56.56
the tenacity to achieve the impossible and the resiliency to do it again and again.

11
00:00:58.56 --> 00:01:03.20
Nick Lavery's story is truly an exemplar of that.

12
00:01:06.56 --> 00:01:12.32
And that right there is an excerpt from a book. The book is called objective secure and the book

13
00:01:12.32 --> 00:01:20.64
is actually written by Nick Lavery and the words in that excerpt were spoken by Lieutenant General

14
00:01:20.64 --> 00:01:26.96
Francis Baudette, who is the commander of US Army Special Operations.

15
00:01:28.08 --> 00:01:32.64
And the speech was given when Nick received an award for his service in Special Operations.

16
00:01:32.64 --> 00:01:42.32
And I think anyone that hears Nick's story will agree that Nick is exactly what the general said.

17
00:01:42.32 --> 00:01:50.40
He is a warrior who can absolutely accomplish the impossible. And it is an honor to have Nick

18
00:01:50.40 --> 00:01:57.68
with us here tonight to talk us through his experiences and share some of his lessons learned.

19
00:01:57.68 --> 00:02:02.64
Nick, thanks for coming down, man. Thanks for having me. I wanted to read a really quick intro

20
00:02:02.64 --> 00:02:05.92
so we could start talking, man. Yeah, man, let's do it. That's where I'm at.

21
00:02:07.12 --> 00:02:15.60
Yeah, freaking insane. Your life's been kind of crazy thus far. And we'll get into that. Let's

22
00:02:16.80 --> 00:02:22.16
start from the beginning. Normally, when you've spoken nine words, everyone knows where you're from.

23
00:02:22.16 --> 00:02:30.000
Pretty quick, yeah. Yeah. Boston Mass is where I claim home. I guess more accurately, though,

24
00:02:31.36 --> 00:02:39.76
is I'm a nomad of Massachusetts. I moved every 12 to 18 months as a kid all the way up until

25
00:02:39.76 --> 00:02:44.64
eventually I got to college. And that's because your parents were just moving around?

26
00:02:45.60 --> 00:02:52.000
Yeah, a lot of it was financially related. Both my parents, they had me and my youngest

27
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.92
sister, real young, so struggling as young parents and trying to just grind it out with also my father

28
00:02:58.80 --> 00:03:04.08
trying to pursue his passion in life, trying to figure out what that is and go after it while

29
00:03:04.08 --> 00:03:08.48
he's got two young kids he needs to feed. How old was even your handiw? And how old was your mom?

30
00:03:08.48 --> 00:03:15.12
20. And my mother was 22. That's like old school. Yeah. My sister's two years younger than me.

31
00:03:15.12 --> 00:03:21.84
So, you know, they do what they had to do. And, you know, I love them and respect them for it.

32
00:03:21.84 --> 00:03:28.72
But that part of the story, that movement is deeply rooted in a lot of what we're going to get into

33
00:03:28.72 --> 00:03:35.04
here today. Like those experiences, particularly me struggling socially, struggling to make friends

34
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:40.80
and keep friends and being the new kid in school every year. In today's world, what's known as

35
00:03:40.80 --> 00:03:48.24
bullying, you know, back then wasn't as looked at as it is today. So, my resiliency started from

36
00:03:48.24 --> 00:03:54.000
the time that I, you know, was five years old and went to kindergarten. That thing, we were just

37
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.04
talking about bullying yesterday as a matter of fact, because it is, we were talking about like

38
00:03:59.04 --> 00:04:02.72
everyone gets bullied, right? Well, at least back in the day when I grew up and you grew up, when

39
00:04:02.72 --> 00:04:08.000
Echogrup, we all got bullied. That wasn't going to happen because no matter what, when you're 10,

40
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.12
there's going to be a 12 year old that's bigger than you. And when you're 12, there's going to be a

41
00:04:11.12 --> 00:04:16.56
14 year old that's bigger than you. And when I got bullied and pushed around and shoved in the

42
00:04:16.56 --> 00:04:21.04
lockers and all those things, I kind of was just like, that's it. To me, it was just sort of the

43
00:04:21.04 --> 00:04:26.48
way things went. Like, oh yeah, well, I'm smaller right now. And I'm going to get knocked around a

44
00:04:26.48 --> 00:04:32.08
bit because I'm smaller. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I don't know. It didn't like

45
00:04:32.08 --> 00:04:40.40
hit me in some big emotional way. I don't know. Am I dumb? No, you're just you, bro. You're just you.

46
00:04:40.40 --> 00:04:47.52
I definitely struggled with it more so than you did. Eventually, I became conditioned to it though,

47
00:04:47.52 --> 00:04:57.84
which, you know, took a few years. Then it became normal for me. I wasn't as understanding of it

48
00:04:57.84 --> 00:05:05.04
as the way you just put it. But I just, my mind was conditioned to deal with the pain and discomfort

49
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:12.96
and embarrassment. So the effect was less and less and less over time. Early on, coming home with

50
00:05:12.96 --> 00:05:17.36
tears in my eyes just about every day of school. And my parents are doing their best to kind of mentor

51
00:05:17.36 --> 00:05:22.56
me and be like, you're going to be good. You're giving me some guidance. But then eight months

52
00:05:22.56 --> 00:05:28.24
but then, you know, eight months later, I'm in a new location and it's that's all over again. But the,

53
00:05:28.24 --> 00:05:31.68
I guess I never had that too because I like basically grew up in the same town with the same people

54
00:05:31.68 --> 00:05:37.44
all the time. Everybody knew who I was and knew who my sisters were, you know, whatever. So I didn't

55
00:05:37.44 --> 00:05:42.56
have to go into some new environment. So I never really experienced that. Yeah, it was tough. But I

56
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:48.24
look back now, of course, extremely grateful for that. Because a lot of people, you know, they

57
00:05:48.24 --> 00:05:51.76
asked a lot of the questions, how'd you do this? How'd you do that? I don't typically just dive

58
00:05:51.76 --> 00:05:56.48
straight into that portion of the story. But if I extract this thing all the way down,

59
00:05:57.68 --> 00:06:02.40
that's deeply seated in that. Is there anything that you remember? Do you remember like one kid?

60
00:06:02.40 --> 00:06:07.60
Do you remember, you know, I wrote a book about bullying. There's a bully in their name, Kenny

61
00:06:07.60 --> 00:06:15.28
Williams, you know, who's just bullying. Do you remember any specific like things that happened

62
00:06:15.28 --> 00:06:23.76
where it really left a mark? I'd say the most clearest memory comes back was a kid who was

63
00:06:23.76 --> 00:06:29.52
maybe two years older than me. And he, you know, he would beat on me just about every day. And one

64
00:06:29.52 --> 00:06:36.000
day got dropped off the bus. He gave me an exceptionally good beating this particular day.

65
00:06:36.72 --> 00:06:42.88
So normally I come home, I wouldn't be like visibly beat up. And I would hide it from my parents. I

66
00:06:42.88 --> 00:06:47.20
wouldn't let them know how often I was getting like beat on. Because I even had this young person,

67
00:06:47.20 --> 00:06:51.52
I felt bad for them because they're struggling and they're grinding it out. I didn't want to add to

68
00:06:51.52 --> 00:06:55.76
their stress. Like we're getting kicked out of this house or moving to another house. Like they're

69
00:06:55.76 --> 00:07:00.96
working their balls off. I could see that as a young person. So I would hide it. One particular

70
00:07:00.96 --> 00:07:06.24
day there was no, there was no hiding it. Right. So I was like busted up pretty good, walked in,

71
00:07:06.24 --> 00:07:10.32
and, you know, my father got home from work a little later and the kid lived just down the

72
00:07:10.32 --> 00:07:14.88
street from us. So he grabbed me and like drugged me down the street and I'm begging him, like,

73
00:07:14.88 --> 00:07:19.60
no, no, no, let's not do this. You're going to make it worse. Let's not do this. That was in,

74
00:07:19.60 --> 00:07:23.84
I don't know, third grade. So it was probably, I don't know, seven or eight ish. I'm like, dad,

75
00:07:23.84 --> 00:07:28.80
no, he's like, no, no, no, we're doing this. No, you know, knocks on the door. And this kid,

76
00:07:28.80 --> 00:07:33.28
you know, his parents weren't all that put together, you know, father answers the door,

77
00:07:33.28 --> 00:07:41.60
hippy looking dude, but like big, hairy, hairy, big mustache, you know, shirtless answers the door.

78
00:07:41.60 --> 00:07:47.28
And here my father had some words where it almost went physical between the two of them,

79
00:07:47.28 --> 00:07:51.68
right on this dude's doorstep, you know, and the kid I was dealing with is behind his father.

80
00:07:51.68 --> 00:07:56.56
And he's now he's yelling at me about how I'm going to get it worse. And I'm like, this is not

81
00:07:56.56 --> 00:08:02.16
working out for anybody. Ironically, though, however, it did, I do remember that it did tone

82
00:08:02.16 --> 00:08:06.64
down after that. So it reached the precipice of confrontation, but it did kind of level things

83
00:08:06.64 --> 00:08:12.32
off a little bit. Yeah, that's, that's, that's a little bit crazy. You know, that's that's what

84
00:08:12.32 --> 00:08:18.24
the dad wants to do, right? Echo Charles, what that was, that was a real strong affirmative over

85
00:08:18.24 --> 00:08:23.60
there. Did your dad get into it? Back you up? No, no, but I don't know. I'm thinking like,

86
00:08:23.60 --> 00:08:27.92
every time like I hear a bully story, yeah, you know, I have kids and now they're small.

87
00:08:27.92 --> 00:08:35.76
But if I, you know, you imagine them coming home with visible damage, bro, oh yeah, you want to go

88
00:08:35.76 --> 00:08:40.56
over there and kill everybody. Like whoever was even a part of it. We had a kid, we had a guy at

89
00:08:40.56 --> 00:08:48.32
this gym. And he worked here. And he did sales. And but you know, he was he's kind of, you know,

90
00:08:48.32 --> 00:08:54.08
like a, like a loudmouth, you know, always poking fun, always, you know, that kind of guy. And he

91
00:08:54.08 --> 00:09:01.60
did jujitsu, the brown belt, you know, and he used to roll with my son and he would kind of like

92
00:09:01.60 --> 00:09:06.40
bully my son, you know, when my son was a little kid, he'd like, you know, maybe slap him around

93
00:09:06.40 --> 00:09:13.36
a little bit on the mats, you know, maybe give the noogies, right? And I remember one day when

94
00:09:13.36 --> 00:09:20.64
my kid was maybe like 10 or 11 years old, we're leaving the gym and I didn't like painty mind to

95
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:26.08
it. You know, he would just get abused or whatever bullied whatever while I was training or something

96
00:09:26.08 --> 00:09:30.56
by, you know, he's trying to train and this guy would grab and rough him up. And one day we're

97
00:09:30.56 --> 00:09:37.44
walking out and and my son goes, Hey, dad, I go, Hey, what's up? And he goes, Do you think that guy,

98
00:09:37.44 --> 00:09:46.08
he's like, Do you think he'll be here when I'm like 20? And I was like, I don't know, but I could

99
00:09:46.08 --> 00:09:52.08
see he's plotting. Wow. I mean, he's plotting on this dude. So that guy doesn't work here anymore.

100
00:09:52.08 --> 00:09:55.76
So he's probably going to get away with it. But that's the kind of thing where you think like

101
00:09:55.76 --> 00:10:02.96
that left a mark on my kid, like, Oh, when the time comes, I'm going to train and I'm going to work

102
00:10:02.96 --> 00:10:06.16
and I'm going to be bigger and stronger. That guy will come back when I'm 20.

103
00:10:07.12 --> 00:10:10.48
How old was he when it happened? It was probably like, I mean, this happened for years. I mean,

104
00:10:10.48 --> 00:10:16.96
we've had this gym since he was since my son was like five. So this could have happened anywhere

105
00:10:16.96 --> 00:10:21.92
between the ages of five and 15, you know, like he was forecasting. Yeah, that gate down the road.

106
00:10:21.92 --> 00:10:26.96
But this was when my son was like 10, he was thinking, Hey, he was, yes, he was forecasting

107
00:10:26.96 --> 00:10:34.56
by the time I'm 20, that guy is going to be old and I'm going to be ready. My prime. I think

108
00:10:34.56 --> 00:10:42.80
he is about 20. He's coming. Yeah. That clock is ticking. I'm going to go to the book here,

109
00:10:42.80 --> 00:10:46.72
give you a little childhood background here. When I was around nine years old, my parents

110
00:10:46.72 --> 00:10:53.76
bought me a dumbbell set. It had pairs of three, five and eight pounders. I began constantly working

111
00:10:53.76 --> 00:10:58.16
out my bedroom. Eventually I got to an age when I could join a gym. No matter where I was living

112
00:10:58.16 --> 00:11:04.000
at the time, I would scout out a nearby place to train often, my oftentimes miles away. I would

113
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.80
ride my bike there and back. The progress wasn't what I had hoped for. Neither did it have much

114
00:11:08.80 --> 00:11:14.72
of an effect on my social life. But the desire to be big and strong remained. I caught the bug.

115
00:11:15.60 --> 00:11:20.88
Mother nature eventually blessed me with a growth spurt, shooting me up over six feet five,

116
00:11:20.88 --> 00:11:25.76
and my consistent work in the weight room paid off. I introduced different combat sports and

117
00:11:25.76 --> 00:11:32.000
martial arts into my life. I was no longer picked on. And as my social skills also developed,

118
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.80
I was no longer without friends. So you started getting after it.

119
00:11:38.72 --> 00:11:43.04
Yeah, I don't know if that connection, I don't know if that was a pre-planned segue

120
00:11:43.04 --> 00:11:47.36
with your song, but that's, I mean, that's perfect. Because I didn't have a specific

121
00:11:47.36 --> 00:11:52.88
dude in mind that I was targeting a decade down the road. It was really everybody I was targeting.

122
00:11:52.88 --> 00:12:01.36
But the grind began then in order to build up the confidence that I wanted and needed.

123
00:12:02.24 --> 00:12:04.32
And so when did you start wrestling?

124
00:12:05.28 --> 00:12:11.52
High school. Yeah, I wrestled high school for my first three years up until my senior year,

125
00:12:11.52 --> 00:12:16.96
which is when football became the only sport that I would play. Our head coach,

126
00:12:16.96 --> 00:12:22.96
head football coach was also the athletic director of the program. So I started getting

127
00:12:22.96 --> 00:12:28.48
looked at to play football my junior year by college scouts. So come senior year, he's like,

128
00:12:28.48 --> 00:12:33.20
not all you're doing in the weight room, it's football. You can run with the track team to

129
00:12:33.20 --> 00:12:37.44
help you with your speed and conditioning, but you are football 24 seven. And you were down

130
00:12:37.44 --> 00:12:44.16
for the cause on that, right? Absolutely. Yeah, that became my primary sport earlier than high school.

131
00:12:44.16 --> 00:12:50.96
And then I saw it as as a way to go to college because I was not an academic by any stretch.

132
00:12:50.96 --> 00:12:55.12
You weren't talking about doing the bare minimum just to be able to stay eligible to play sports.

133
00:12:55.12 --> 00:13:01.04
That was me, man. So that was my only route to college. So I was cool with that adjustment.

134
00:13:01.04 --> 00:13:01.84
When did you grow?

135
00:13:03.44 --> 00:13:09.68
I was a peanut. Most of my life growing up. I was a massive baby. I was born I was 12 pounds,

136
00:13:09.68 --> 00:13:17.36
nine ounces as a baby. And my mother, that's not a baby, bro. That's like a small child.

137
00:13:17.36 --> 00:13:22.000
Yeah, I said, I set the record at the hospital, which has since closed. So I own that forever.

138
00:13:22.80 --> 00:13:27.68
And my mother's, you know, she's a hippie and she wanted to have this natural birth process.

139
00:13:27.68 --> 00:13:32.08
And the doctor's like, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. We have to go in and remove this

140
00:13:32.08 --> 00:13:38.48
human from you because he will split you in half. So that's the route I took. And I was massive as

141
00:13:38.48 --> 00:13:43.20
a baby. And then I became really, really small. Like I wrestled at 123, you know, my freshman year.

142
00:13:43.20 --> 00:13:49.68
So little, I was maybe 5556 little guy. Damn. It wasn't till I think it was between my sophomore

143
00:13:49.68 --> 00:13:55.52
and junior year of high school that I hit this massive growth spurt. And I shot up like six inches

144
00:13:55.52 --> 00:14:02.08
over a summer. And my, my joints were all achy. And I had Oz Goods, what it was called my shirt.

145
00:14:02.08 --> 00:14:10.56
I had that going and I was dangly and awkward because I had gotten so tall, came back my junior.

146
00:14:10.56 --> 00:14:14.08
Yeah. And my football coach, all my coaches were like, what do we even do with you now?

147
00:14:14.08 --> 00:14:18.56
You know, because you're, you're growing so tall. But between that time and then the time

148
00:14:18.56 --> 00:14:24.16
I graduated those two years was when I shot up, you know, like over a foot over the course of two

149
00:14:24.16 --> 00:14:30.64
years. That's insane. It was wild, man. And it was even, it was stranger because in my birthday,

150
00:14:30.64 --> 00:14:36.40
September 1st, which is coming up here pretty soon, I went to school early. So everyone in my

151
00:14:36.40 --> 00:14:41.84
class was a year ahead of me. So I started college, for example, at 17 years old, was my

152
00:14:41.84 --> 00:14:47.36
freshman year college. So I was already like a year behind everybody in terms of my maturity

153
00:14:47.36 --> 00:14:52.56
and my puberty development. So even my buddies, once I had them, their voices are dropping,

154
00:14:52.56 --> 00:14:57.60
they're getting hair in new places. And I'm still this little squeaky mouse, right? You know,

155
00:14:57.60 --> 00:15:01.44
trying to lift my eight pound dumbbell set so I could stay, you know, one of the, one of the cool

156
00:15:01.44 --> 00:15:07.52
kids. So I was real late to the game with all that stuff. Yeah. That's why parents hold their

157
00:15:07.52 --> 00:15:13.76
kids back. That's a big deal, man. Holding the kids back so they're little dominators in wrestling.

158
00:15:13.76 --> 00:15:18.32
That's like the way, that's the way, you know, at least in California, kids are getting, kids are

159
00:15:18.32 --> 00:15:24.000
like 23. They're seeing, they're seeing your year, you know, you're like football in Texas.

160
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.44
Oh yeah. It's the same thing. Freaking crazy. You see these seniors in high school with full-blown

161
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:34.96
bids, like men, right? These aren't kids, man. These are men. Yeah. So you, so you must have

162
00:15:34.96 --> 00:15:42.16
started to like just completely shine in football because you get huge. I didn't get huge, like

163
00:15:42.16 --> 00:15:47.44
body mass wise until I was in college. So by the time I graduated my senior year, you know,

164
00:15:47.44 --> 00:15:53.12
I was a strong safety, but I got so tall that the scouts started looking at me for linebacker

165
00:15:53.12 --> 00:15:57.28
in college. They're like, you're eventually going to fill out that frame. We just need to maintain

166
00:15:57.28 --> 00:16:02.88
your speed and stack on some muscle mass to go along with your now new height that you have.

167
00:16:02.88 --> 00:16:09.68
So I was recruited to play linebacker and then the muscle mass really came around, you know,

168
00:16:10.48 --> 00:16:15.52
sophomore year college. I spent my first year in that summer just with the strength coaches

169
00:16:15.52 --> 00:16:20.48
and the nutritionists all within the program that we had at the school, learning how to eat,

170
00:16:20.48 --> 00:16:24.88
learning how to train. And that's when I really filled out my frame. So my sophomore year of

171
00:16:24.88 --> 00:16:32.32
college, you know, I was eventually around like 225, 230. Whereas if I was born in Texas, or if my

172
00:16:32.32 --> 00:16:37.76
father had half a brain and he had done what he should have done, right, I would have been more

173
00:16:37.76 --> 00:16:43.84
than likely D1 full ride playing on Sundays today. I blame him for my current lifestyle.

174
00:16:43.84 --> 00:16:51.76
Did they put you on like a straight up just dirty bulk? Is that the proper term?

175
00:16:51.76 --> 00:16:52.16
Wonderful.

176
00:16:52.16 --> 00:16:57.60
Dirty. I mean, I imagine if you showed up to me and you're a freshman in college and you weigh

177
00:16:57.60 --> 00:17:05.04
whatever 185 pounds, I'm like, cool, deadlift, squat and just eat. Did they put you on that?

178
00:17:05.04 --> 00:17:08.64
Like you said nutritionist, I thought the nutritionist at that point would be dominoes.

179
00:17:08.64 --> 00:17:09.36
Just eat everything.

180
00:17:09.36 --> 00:17:10.000
Just eat everything.

181
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.92
No, it wasn't. It was more dialed in. I had a regimented meal plan that I would just show up

182
00:17:15.92 --> 00:17:22.24
to the cafeteria and just give them my name and then they would give me the food. But it wasn't

183
00:17:22.24 --> 00:17:27.12
just like pizza and like hot pockets and shit. It was like real food. It was just a lot of it.

184
00:17:28.64 --> 00:17:32.72
There was a basketball player named Manu Boal who played for the University of Bridgeport. He

185
00:17:32.72 --> 00:17:38.96
came from Africa and he was seven, 10 or something crazy. And when he got here, he weighed, you know,

186
00:17:38.96 --> 00:17:44.56
like some tiny amount. And I read some article that they were like, hey, they were just pizza and

187
00:17:44.56 --> 00:17:50.40
beer. Like we just need this guy to eat everything he can to just get a little bit bigger because

188
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:51.20
he was too skinny.

189
00:17:52.40 --> 00:17:58.16
Yeah. That it's weird. I mean, we're in the generation where they know a lot about nutrition

190
00:17:58.16 --> 00:18:03.04
nowadays where even in our college where if they would have guys gain weight, it would be good.

191
00:18:03.04 --> 00:18:03.28
Good.

192
00:18:03.28 --> 00:18:03.84
Oh, no kidding.

193
00:18:03.84 --> 00:18:07.84
In fact, yeah, we had a program called Training Table where all the football players would go

194
00:18:07.84 --> 00:18:13.12
and they'd eat separate and it'd be different food. And it's all like good food. There's no pizza.

195
00:18:13.12 --> 00:18:16.88
There's no that kind of like chicken, veg, potatoes. Yeah.

196
00:18:17.44 --> 00:18:22.32
Yeah. A lot of potatoes. But that was really where I began learning about nutrition.

197
00:18:22.32 --> 00:18:27.04
And then I was seeing the effects as it pertained to me on the field. And that was where I really

198
00:18:27.04 --> 00:18:32.48
fell in love with training and fitness and, you know, continuing that through today. That was

199
00:18:32.48 --> 00:18:35.20
the foundation of that knowledge was at that point.

200
00:18:35.20 --> 00:18:39.20
And then so how did it go? How did it go in the football college career?

201
00:18:40.08 --> 00:18:46.72
It was good. You know, I played, I played D2 at UMass and UMass Lowell. And, you know, my first

202
00:18:47.28 --> 00:18:51.76
freshman year, you know, it didn't didn't get really any playing time. But I was still kind of

203
00:18:51.76 --> 00:18:55.44
growing and developing. SoftMoy, I started to play a little bit. And then junior year, I was starting.

204
00:18:56.96 --> 00:19:01.12
I say junior year because that's the way we normally break it down. But for me, it was like

205
00:19:01.12 --> 00:19:08.80
more like my sophomore year, 2.0, you know, because I wasn't in line with the credits I needed to

206
00:19:08.80 --> 00:19:15.76
stay on track to graduate in four years. Right. So, but my second or third year of playing ball,

207
00:19:15.76 --> 00:19:22.40
my third year in college was when I was on the field. And then my fourth year, I took a, I took

208
00:19:22.40 --> 00:19:28.88
a pretty nasty injury to my back and that ended my season a little early. That was your senior year?

209
00:19:28.88 --> 00:19:34.56
Yeah. So what year was that? That had been 2004, 2005.

210
00:19:34.56 --> 00:19:39.20
Okay. So where were you and what were you doing when September 11th happened?

211
00:19:40.16 --> 00:19:47.28
That was my sophomore year. Yeah. SoftMoy or my second year of school was not 11.

212
00:19:47.28 --> 00:19:52.16
Were you, is that what focused you maybe thinking about being in the military?

213
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:59.60
Yeah. I mean, that was certainly the tipping point for me was that I started looking at it in high

214
00:19:59.60 --> 00:20:04.48
school around my freshman sophomore year and no direction. I skipped school one day. I went

215
00:20:04.48 --> 00:20:07.92
downtown Boston and I went with a Marine Corps recruiter. And I said, I think I want to be a

216
00:20:07.92 --> 00:20:12.16
Marine and he's like, perfect. Finish high school and come back and we got you. We got you, bro.

217
00:20:12.16 --> 00:20:17.12
I'm like, great. So I had like kind of an idea because I hated school. I liked athletics, but I

218
00:20:17.12 --> 00:20:22.24
was tiny. There was no future in that for me. I wanted to, again, I wanted to be respected. I

219
00:20:22.24 --> 00:20:27.76
wanted to be feared in a lot of way because I lived my life in fear most of the time. And the Marine

220
00:20:27.76 --> 00:20:33.12
Corps was the route to give me what I needed. He's like, cool, graduate high school, come back.

221
00:20:33.12 --> 00:20:36.32
Did he take your number or anything? I don't think so.

222
00:20:36.32 --> 00:20:40.64
It might be too far outside their window because they got to get their quotas and all that.

223
00:20:41.68 --> 00:20:45.20
At the same time, like when they, when you walk in there, it's like a going on to a car

224
00:20:45.20 --> 00:20:50.64
dealership. Like they're ready to take you. But I guess if you were like 13, he's like,

225
00:20:50.64 --> 00:20:54.64
come back when you graduate. Yeah. I don't remember any, any exchange of information.

226
00:20:55.20 --> 00:20:59.44
The only thing that detracted me from going that route was, was football, was athletics. So

227
00:20:59.44 --> 00:21:05.28
went to college, you know, kind of plan B. And then sophomore year was, yeah, that was 9-11.

228
00:21:05.28 --> 00:21:11.04
And then at that point, I struggled to stay in school because I was really angry and I wanted

229
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:15.60
to be part of the response to that. I struggled to stay in school, listen to some, you know,

230
00:21:15.60 --> 00:21:20.96
family and friends and mentors and decided to stay in and grind out the rest of my degree.

231
00:21:20.96 --> 00:21:24.40
And then look at options to come in. Would you, would you get your degree in?

232
00:21:24.40 --> 00:21:29.76
Criminology. And then you, so you know you're graduating. What did you, what did you say,

233
00:21:29.76 --> 00:21:37.60
graduated? 2005? I graduated in 2007. Oh, no kidding. So yeah. You know, normally if you go to

234
00:21:37.60 --> 00:21:43.76
college for seven years, they call you doctor. Maybe they, it's just Nick still. So, you know,

235
00:21:43.76 --> 00:21:49.52
a lot of different academic probations and having to redo semesters, you know,

236
00:21:50.16 --> 00:21:53.84
it made it easy for me to be eligible for football because it's played in the fall.

237
00:21:54.40 --> 00:21:59.92
So all I needed to do was maintain, I think it was nine credits, like three classes,

238
00:22:00.72 --> 00:22:06.32
and just not fail any of them. If I could, I could fail all the rest of my classes after the

239
00:22:06.32 --> 00:22:12.64
season was over and I didn't care. And that was the route I took. I immature. I didn't, I didn't

240
00:22:12.64 --> 00:22:17.60
care. You know, I look back now and I'm like, man, you know, what if I just applied myself and now

241
00:22:17.60 --> 00:22:22.24
I enjoy reading and learning and studying, but back then I didn't, I didn't care. So yeah, 2007

242
00:22:22.88 --> 00:22:28.32
was when I finally received my degree. And then when did you talk to recruiter? So now did you

243
00:22:28.32 --> 00:22:34.80
still look at the Marine Corps or how'd that go? I looked at the Navy. Oh, okay. Graduated college,

244
00:22:34.80 --> 00:22:40.08
the war was still going on. Now Iraq is kicked off as well. So Afghanistan, Iraq are both surgeon

245
00:22:40.08 --> 00:22:45.36
as prime for someone to go in and get some. And I'm like, yep, here we go. So I maybe it was a

246
00:22:45.36 --> 00:22:51.52
week after I graduated college, I went downtown Boston. And in the same building, they had three

247
00:22:51.52 --> 00:22:56.24
branches. They had the Navy, the Marines and the Army and three separate offices. And I went into

248
00:22:56.24 --> 00:23:00.32
the Navy office first and I said, I want to be a seal. And I knew I wanted to be in special

249
00:23:00.32 --> 00:23:03.84
operations. I want to be right at the front of the fight. And the seals came, comes to mind

250
00:23:03.84 --> 00:23:10.40
really fast today as then of being the ultimate badass warrior. So I walked in and said, I want

251
00:23:10.40 --> 00:23:16.56
to be a seal. And he said, perfect. Let's get you enlisted in the Navy. And then you can request

252
00:23:16.56 --> 00:23:22.56
to go to Bud's and go that route. And I said, okay, thank you. And I left. And I went and talked to

253
00:23:22.56 --> 00:23:26.96
the Marine Corps recruiter and I got the same answer. When I went and talked to the Army, I got

254
00:23:26.96 --> 00:23:32.80
a different answer. They said, we have this program called the Special Forces Recruit Contract Option,

255
00:23:32.80 --> 00:23:39.36
known as the 18X-ray, which I'm sure you're familiar with, gets you straight into the

256
00:23:39.36 --> 00:23:43.36
Army Special Forces. You bypass the conventional Army, assuming you make it all the way through.

257
00:23:44.56 --> 00:23:53.36
The Navy recruits, the Navy brings in a lot of people that want to be seals that aren't going

258
00:23:53.36 --> 00:24:00.000
to be seals. I mean, a lot of people. And it's interesting that you were able to identify that

259
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.24
that what they were offering you wasn't what you actually wanted. And there are programs. I'm

260
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:12.08
surprised that there are programs that you get like a contract to go at least get a shot at Bud's.

261
00:24:12.08 --> 00:24:16.000
Those things do exist. When I came in, that's what I did. It was at the time, it was called the

262
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.32
Dive Farrer Program. I have no idea what that means, but it was like, you are guaranteed

263
00:24:21.20 --> 00:24:26.80
an opportunity to take to test to go to Bud's. And I was like, yeah, cool, sign me up. But it

264
00:24:26.80 --> 00:24:33.20
sounds like that guy didn't even have that much to offer you. No, no. And I mean, if he had chances

265
00:24:33.20 --> 00:24:36.64
out, things would look a little different right now because I would have taken it. Because that

266
00:24:36.64 --> 00:24:40.000
was my goal. I was like, I want to be a seal. Boom. If he had said, hey, man, we got this option right

267
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.92
here, we'll get you into Bud's within the first six months or whatever. Some kind of guarantee.

268
00:24:45.12 --> 00:24:49.60
I probably would have signed it right there. And then, yeah, he, man, that's weird. I wonder

269
00:24:49.60 --> 00:24:52.96
what was up with that. And then the Marine Corps, same thing. The Marine Corps used to be like,

270
00:24:52.96 --> 00:24:57.28
hey, you joined the Marines and you don't even get any kind of select. You're going to join the

271
00:24:57.28 --> 00:25:02.40
Marines. We'll give you a job. That's the way the Marine Corps, it's better now. But the Army has

272
00:25:02.40 --> 00:25:08.16
had that 18X Ray program has been freaking goldmine for them. Yeah. It kicked off, you know,

273
00:25:08.16 --> 00:25:13.12
originally back in the day. And then, and then it went away for a while and they turned it back

274
00:25:13.12 --> 00:25:18.56
on in 2002, you know, post 9-11, when the ODA was getting requested to do a whole bunch of stuff.

275
00:25:18.56 --> 00:25:23.36
So like, we need to, we need to get more quality candidates. Let's start this program back up again.

276
00:25:23.36 --> 00:25:27.84
Yeah. I don't know if you've heard some of the SOG guys, a lot of those SOG guys were

277
00:25:27.84 --> 00:25:33.44
off the street and straight into SF and they'll defend the 18X Ray. They'll, we're all eight.

278
00:25:33.44 --> 00:25:38.88
We're basically 18X Ray because they just came right in and went in and went to NAMM and got

279
00:25:38.88 --> 00:25:46.16
after it. So that's what happened. So you end up, did you even think about an officer program or

280
00:25:46.16 --> 00:25:51.76
was that just not happening? I mean, it sounds like your grades stellar. Grades were not stellar.

281
00:25:52.88 --> 00:25:56.80
It was offered to me. It was brought up to me by my recruiter, but the X-Ray,

282
00:25:56.80 --> 00:26:03.12
18X Ray contracts, not an option for offices. So it immediately wiped that off the table for me.

283
00:26:03.92 --> 00:26:11.36
Also, my interpretation of what offices do back then was a little off. There's some truth to it,

284
00:26:11.36 --> 00:26:16.32
but in my mind then, officers strictly sat behind a desk and enlisted guys were the actual guys

285
00:26:16.32 --> 00:26:20.72
that worked. And I wanted to be a worker. I wanted to get my hands dirty and everything else dirty.

286
00:26:20.72 --> 00:26:24.40
I wanted to get into it. I don't want to be the guy telling the guy to do the thing. I want to be

287
00:26:24.40 --> 00:26:32.32
the guy doing the thing. And in soft, that's obviously not the case. But because the X-Ray

288
00:26:32.32 --> 00:26:36.64
option didn't exist for O's, that automatically made it a non-option for me.

289
00:26:36.64 --> 00:26:43.36
What did your parents think of this? My father essentially tried to ground me when I brought

290
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:51.52
this to his attention. I was 24. 24, a lot of life experience. I graduated college and I called

291
00:26:51.52 --> 00:26:55.52
him up because I had done my homework. I didn't sign the X-Ray contract right there in 1998.

292
00:26:55.52 --> 00:27:01.20
I went home. I said, thank you. I didn't know what Green Berets did. I'd seen Rambo and John Wayne,

293
00:27:01.20 --> 00:27:05.52
but I didn't know what an SF-ODA does, what a Green Beret really does. So I did some homework.

294
00:27:05.52 --> 00:27:10.48
I was drawn to the mission. I was really attracted by the timeline. That's what ultimately made me

295
00:27:10.48 --> 00:27:15.68
pull the trigger. But once I did my homework, made my decision, I don't think I'd sign the contract

296
00:27:15.68 --> 00:27:20.48
yet, but I called my father and I said, hey, dad, there's what I'm going to do. And he's like, no,

297
00:27:20.48 --> 00:27:27.68
you're not. And I'm like, listen, dude, I love you. You're my best friend in the world. I'm not

298
00:27:27.68 --> 00:27:35.44
asking you permission. I'm 24. But as a new father now, my kids are also young. I can put

299
00:27:35.44 --> 00:27:38.96
myself in his shoes. He sees the news. He sees what's going on. He knows where I'm trying to go,

300
00:27:38.96 --> 00:27:44.64
and he's just scared for me, which is fine. But they were both totally against it to begin with.

301
00:27:44.64 --> 00:27:48.72
Now, you described your mom as a hippie. Is that like classic definition of a hippie?

302
00:27:50.08 --> 00:27:55.76
She's a free spirit. Yeah, she's a free spirit. She's got her stones and she's got her crystals

303
00:27:55.76 --> 00:28:00.56
in the bedroom. She's got some crystals. She's got a dream catcher over the bed. Got some incense,

304
00:28:00.56 --> 00:28:05.92
burning. Okay. She's in there. Yeah, man. She must have been really freaking out.

305
00:28:05.92 --> 00:28:11.92
Yeah. She's less than my father. My father's much more like rigid and objective and scientific.

306
00:28:11.92 --> 00:28:15.04
My mother was still kind of like, well, you need to, you know, you need to choose your

307
00:28:15.04 --> 00:28:20.88
own journey kind of thing. Oh, right. But I'd rather you not do that, but like, you need to be

308
00:28:21.52 --> 00:28:27.36
who you need to be kind of thing. Okay, we'll take it. I remember I just came home and told my

309
00:28:27.36 --> 00:28:32.88
parents, yeah, I just enlisted the Navy, you know, and my dad just looks at me, he goes,

310
00:28:32.88 --> 00:28:38.24
you're going to hate it. He said, you don't hate you hate authority and you don't listen to anybody.

311
00:28:38.24 --> 00:28:43.04
And I said, I'm going to be in the SEAL teams. It's a team. You don't know nothing, old man.

312
00:28:44.32 --> 00:28:49.92
Do you come from a military family background? My grandfather was in the army. My dad's dad

313
00:28:49.92 --> 00:28:56.88
was in the army for 20 years. My dad got kicked out of ROTC. And he says that the military gene

314
00:28:56.88 --> 00:29:01.52
skips a generation because my dad's not a very militaristic dude, but I was a real, I was a

315
00:29:01.52 --> 00:29:05.92
rebellious kid. So my dad was looking at my, but they were both like, cool, you know, get out of

316
00:29:05.92 --> 00:29:09.52
here. That's probably the best thing that could happen as you go in the military instead of

317
00:29:09.52 --> 00:29:15.28
staying around here causing trouble being an idiot, which I was doing a good job of. So

318
00:29:15.28 --> 00:29:19.84
rolled out and that was that. But I, yeah, I didn't, I just came home and told them I did it. So

319
00:29:20.40 --> 00:29:24.16
they were, I think they overall, they were like, this is probably a really good thing that this

320
00:29:24.16 --> 00:29:31.92
idiot's getting out, getting off the payroll. That's right. Let's jump back to the book here

321
00:29:31.92 --> 00:29:38.80
real quick. August 13th, 2007 was my first day in the United States Army. It began at the 30th

322
00:29:38.80 --> 00:29:44.56
Adjutant General Reception Battalion located in Fort Benning, Georgia. This is the first location.

323
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:49.20
US Army basic training recruits arrived prior to the actual start of basic training. Its purposes

324
00:29:49.20 --> 00:29:53.68
to receive, prepare and train personnel for what lies ahead. While I am sure we were given some

325
00:29:53.68 --> 00:29:58.16
classes, the only things that I recall during my time at the 30th AG were doing paperwork,

326
00:29:58.16 --> 00:30:02.000
eating our three meals a day and waiting, a lot of waiting, most of which was spent

327
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.12
standing in formation. We stood in formation for hours each day. While in formation waiting,

328
00:30:07.12 --> 00:30:11.76
for what seemed like an eternity, we would sound off with several mantras. The soldiers

329
00:30:11.76 --> 00:30:16.72
creed the Army song and the warrior ethos are a few that come to mind. At any point, a drill

330
00:30:16.72 --> 00:30:21.92
sergeant, a member of the command or any soldier in the formation would simply yell, the warrior ethos.

331
00:30:21.92 --> 00:30:27.20
Then the entire formation of soldiers would sound off with that mantra. This served two

332
00:30:27.20 --> 00:30:31.60
purposes. One, it killed time, even if it was only 30 seconds of time, it gave us something to do.

333
00:30:32.16 --> 00:30:39.20
Two, it ingrained these mantras into our heads. Basic training is the Army's method to break down

334
00:30:39.20 --> 00:30:46.000
an individual into human clay in order to then be remolded into a soldier. The same goes for

335
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.68
other branches of the military. The verbalization of mantras is part of that process. The warrior

336
00:30:51.68 --> 00:30:57.68
ethos was one of them. The warrior ethos has four tenets. One, I will always place the mission

337
00:30:57.68 --> 00:31:06.08
first. Two, I will never accept defeat. Three, I will never quit. Four, I will never leave a fallen

338
00:31:06.08 --> 00:31:13.68
comrade. So it's welcome to boot camp. How'd you feel about boot camp when you got there?

339
00:31:13.68 --> 00:31:22.08
It was annoying more than anything else. I mean, I was physically in a phenomenal shape.

340
00:31:22.08 --> 00:31:28.24
So physically, it was relatively easy. How long was it between when you enlisted and when you left?

341
00:31:30.56 --> 00:31:35.36
Maybe three, four months. Did you shift your training to be ready for

342
00:31:36.08 --> 00:31:40.24
drastically? Oh yeah, drastically. Pumping rocks and yeah. So because I finished playing football

343
00:31:40.24 --> 00:31:45.60
around 2004, 2005. What did you weigh when you got done? What was your max weight?

344
00:31:46.48 --> 00:31:51.68
Playing ball, I would usually start the season around 250 and I'd end up usually around like 240

345
00:31:51.68 --> 00:31:57.52
by the end of the season. So I was done playing ball, still had more college left and I just

346
00:31:57.52 --> 00:32:02.24
wanted to see how big and strong I could get. I didn't need to be quite as athletic as I needed

347
00:32:02.24 --> 00:32:07.60
to be as a football player. So I got more into strongman and powerlifting type stuff. I was doing

348
00:32:07.60 --> 00:32:10.88
a little bit of boxing, a little bit of light wrestling, but it was mostly just like, let's get

349
00:32:10.88 --> 00:32:16.16
big and strong, which worked for me because what I was doing professionally was VIP security and

350
00:32:16.16 --> 00:32:22.96
nightclub security. So all my bosses liked a big yoked up dude and a suit at the front door.

351
00:32:22.96 --> 00:32:28.80
So it helped me with what I was doing for work and I enjoyed the training. So by the time I

352
00:32:28.80 --> 00:32:34.32
decided to, by the time I graduated college, decided I was going to enlist, I was close to 300

353
00:32:34.32 --> 00:32:40.16
pounds. Damn. Yeah. I mean, I was doing like 12,000 calories a day. I mean, it was just crazy.

354
00:32:40.80 --> 00:32:45.52
So there's no way I was in a condition to go to basic training. Does it take effort for you to

355
00:32:45.52 --> 00:32:51.12
eat 12,000 calories in a day? Yeah. It was hard. It's work. Yeah. I really disliked it.

356
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.52
I'm like choking down chicken breasts and dry potatoes with a gallon of water. My strength

357
00:32:57.52 --> 00:33:01.92
coach is like, hey, this is what it's going to take. If you want an 800 pound deadlift,

358
00:33:01.92 --> 00:33:08.40
this is what you got to do. So I decided to enlist and, you know, I'm huge. So you're 300

359
00:33:08.40 --> 00:33:14.80
pound bouncer. Yeah. Did you ever get a test as a bouncer that you had any trouble with?

360
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.56
No, not really. Not at that point, man. I mean, I can just imagine you're six foot five, 300 pounds.

361
00:33:22.56 --> 00:33:29.68
You wrestled like you must have been a real quick peacemaker in these scenarios. Yeah. At that point,

362
00:33:29.68 --> 00:33:33.84
man, you know, I was so comfortable with losing fights, although it'd been a couple of years

363
00:33:33.84 --> 00:33:38.96
since that had happened at that point. I'm the biggest guy in the room. I've been boxing since

364
00:33:38.96 --> 00:33:45.04
I was a kid wrestling, you know, some different martial arts. Like I was well equipped. Did you

365
00:33:45.04 --> 00:33:52.16
train Jiu Jitsu yet? No, Jiu Jitsu didn't come on until, until I got into SF actually. Did you

366
00:33:52.16 --> 00:33:56.96
know how to choke people? Did you know like a, did you know like the sleeper hold? Yeah, I knew

367
00:33:56.96 --> 00:34:02.000
about the rear naked choke. Yeah. I knew basic, I knew basic stuff. Like as a bouncer, you occasionally

368
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.88
had to put somebody to sleep. Yeah. Oh yeah. And I, you know, I wasn't the most mature bouncer

369
00:34:09.44 --> 00:34:13.92
until I got a little older. You know, some of the places I worked, some of the people I worked for,

370
00:34:13.92 --> 00:34:18.56
their methodology was let's make, let's punish this person so that they don't think,

371
00:34:18.56 --> 00:34:26.16
oh, no one else thinks to act a fool in my place again, which I enjoyed. I look back with, you

372
00:34:26.16 --> 00:34:29.76
know, some regret hurt and some people that probably didn't need to be hurt that way. But I

373
00:34:29.76 --> 00:34:32.72
mean, that's just the nature of the business. I was in the way. I went about doing it.

374
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:39.84
So big boy. Yeah. So your 300 pounds are almost 300 pounds. Yeah. When you enlist.

375
00:34:40.40 --> 00:34:44.64
When I decide that the military is definitely going to happen. Okay. And by the time that I signed

376
00:34:44.64 --> 00:34:50.24
the contract and then my report date was like four months or so after that point was when I

377
00:34:50.24 --> 00:34:55.76
started my training program. It was about a 16 week program I did. Where'd you get that program?

378
00:34:55.76 --> 00:34:59.52
Did you create it? I was working with a strength coach, same coach I work with today,

379
00:34:59.52 --> 00:35:03.44
actually one of them that I've been working with them now, you know, close to 15 years.

380
00:35:03.44 --> 00:35:08.56
He's so he put it together for me. And obviously it was a wild shift from flipping tires and moving

381
00:35:08.56 --> 00:35:15.44
Atlas stones to, you know, running, rocking dynamic CrossFit style circuit training. So I

382
00:35:15.44 --> 00:35:23.44
sliced myself down over about 16 weeks from, you know, 295 to about 245, about 50 pounds or so came

383
00:35:23.44 --> 00:35:31.84
off. 245, 65 is a big person, right? But I was just diced because I had so much mass on that I just

384
00:35:31.84 --> 00:35:37.04
sliced everything off. So by the time I showed up day one, I don't think this is in the book, this

385
00:35:37.04 --> 00:35:44.32
is no shit. Day one of bootcamp or basic training. Yeah, you're just a savage. I'm a 24 year old,

386
00:35:44.32 --> 00:35:52.08
six for five, 24 pound diced dude. And I'm surrounded by a lot of, you know, 17, 18 year old

387
00:35:52.08 --> 00:35:56.72
children who have never left their house before. And you know, you get your ass smoked right,

388
00:35:56.72 --> 00:36:01.52
of course, for the first several hours when you get there. After me four or five hours,

389
00:36:01.52 --> 00:36:06.72
they're just doing pushups and flutter kicks and setups, I'm like pumped up my muscles are like full.

390
00:36:07.68 --> 00:36:13.52
And then they do their tattoo inspection. So they strip you down into your underwear,

391
00:36:13.52 --> 00:36:17.36
and they just go person to person to person. And I don't think they're really searching for tattoos,

392
00:36:17.36 --> 00:36:22.24
I think they just want to see like your physique and like expose you and just make you feel uncomfortable.

393
00:36:22.88 --> 00:36:26.56
So all three drill sergeants are like surrounding you when you stand in there and you're

394
00:36:26.56 --> 00:36:30.48
underwear. And they're just like looking you up and down and just like getting into your head.

395
00:36:31.20 --> 00:36:36.08
Well, the tattoos I have on me, this is Latin for strength and honor. I didn't have a lot of

396
00:36:36.08 --> 00:36:41.04
these other tats on me at the time. So these, these stuck out. And they look at me and they're like,

397
00:36:42.08 --> 00:36:46.48
what's your deal? And I'm like, I don't know how to answer this question, you know,

398
00:36:46.48 --> 00:36:51.76
like, why are you here? And I thought they were messing with me. In retrospect, I talked to these

399
00:36:51.76 --> 00:36:56.16
guys late like years later, they're like, we thought you were like an actual like government project

400
00:36:57.28 --> 00:37:03.20
that was going on. Like you were creating a lab or something. Like they didn't know what my deal was.

401
00:37:04.16 --> 00:37:09.04
Because then they asked me about the tattoos. And I say it says strength and honor. And then they

402
00:37:09.04 --> 00:37:14.000
look up at the wall and it's engraved in the wall above the whiteboard. It says strength and honor.

403
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
So now their wheels are really spinning. Like I'm some kind of an implant.

404
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.40
You're from the movie soldier, bro.

405
00:37:21.68 --> 00:37:25.60
And I didn't pick up on all this at the time. Eventually I head drill instructor

406
00:37:26.24 --> 00:37:31.20
later on that evening came over to me and he's like, no, really, man, like, did someone send you here?

407
00:37:32.40 --> 00:37:36.08
I'm like, I can't, I don't know what's happening right now, dude. I'm trying to play the game,

408
00:37:36.08 --> 00:37:42.16
but I don't know what game we're playing right now. So it was more, it was more, I say it was more

409
00:37:42.16 --> 00:37:47.04
annoying and frustrating because I was babysitting kids and I was putting shod in my of my platoon on

410
00:37:47.04 --> 00:37:50.88
day one. Like, you're the guy, we're all going to leave for the night. You're going to make sure

411
00:37:50.88 --> 00:37:54.64
that everyone that's in their beds right now are going to stay in their beds. So I'm, I was literally

412
00:37:54.64 --> 00:37:59.84
chasing kids like down, down the stairwell that were trying to just leave for bedding. I don't

413
00:37:59.84 --> 00:38:04.48
know where they thought they were going to go. But I'm like dragging kids back to their beds, you know.

414
00:38:05.12 --> 00:38:09.68
It wasn't very like tactful with my approach. It was very blunt. Like get your ass back in your

415
00:38:09.68 --> 00:38:15.20
bed and stay down or else, you know. So that was like 16 or 17 weeks and pretty much that.

416
00:38:15.20 --> 00:38:18.000
Yeah, that's classic, dude. You're not a normal dude.

417
00:38:20.48 --> 00:38:26.48
That's friggin awesome. So you do, you go to basic and then you go to, you go straight to AIT after

418
00:38:26.48 --> 00:38:32.000
that? Well, for us as an 18X rate, you do the infantry program, which is called one station

419
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.68
unit training. So they go basic and AIT back to back without any break. So it's boom, boom,

420
00:38:37.68 --> 00:38:42.24
right? Straight through. Are you just having fun this entire time?

421
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:46.56
No, no, I wasn't fun at all. I was just like staring at the clock, like get me out of here.

422
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:50.72
You know, like the runs, like the workouts, they weren't all that like stimulating or difficult.

423
00:38:50.72 --> 00:38:54.24
I was trying to play the game. I did play the game. You know, I wasn't like a rebel. I was like,

424
00:38:54.24 --> 00:38:58.96
Roger that I was a good soldier. I was just like, I want to get to the real work,

425
00:38:58.96 --> 00:39:01.44
which I know is at Fort Bragg. So like get me out of here.

426
00:39:02.64 --> 00:39:06.80
And then so you make it through all this stuff that you had a airborne school too?

427
00:39:06.80 --> 00:39:11.68
Yeah, go when you finish basic or AIT and then you go straight down the street to airborne school.

428
00:39:11.68 --> 00:39:16.24
Get your airborne shuffle on for three weeks. Oh yeah. Do some PLS in the sawdust.

429
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.96
And then it's then it's to where'd you go? Sopsie. Did they have Sopsie up at this point?

430
00:39:22.96 --> 00:39:29.12
Yeah, then it was to Sopsie. And that's to get you ready for that's to get you ready for selection,

431
00:39:29.12 --> 00:39:33.04
right? Correct. You were kind of ready for selection. Oh yeah. Yeah. Were you in worse

432
00:39:33.04 --> 00:39:37.04
shape now than you were when you entered just from being in bootcamp and stuff? Or were you

433
00:39:37.04 --> 00:39:43.92
made able to maintain? No, I was I lost, you know, 20, 25 pounds in basic training, just because I

434
00:39:43.92 --> 00:39:48.56
didn't get I wasn't getting the calories I needed. You're they were starving you. Yeah, the freaking

435
00:39:48.56 --> 00:39:55.28
government project. Yeah, they were trying to cut off you. They wanted to tear me back down and

436
00:39:55.28 --> 00:40:02.96
have me sent back to the lab for for a refit. So I was in I would say I was in worse shape for

437
00:40:03.76 --> 00:40:08.08
selection specifically than I would have been if I had just gone straight to that without going to

438
00:40:08.08 --> 00:40:14.08
basic training. But it was okay because by the time I got to Sopsie and I got to break the stat

439
00:40:14.08 --> 00:40:19.52
Sopsie, then I could eat like normal again and I put some mass back on. So get back into more

440
00:40:19.52 --> 00:40:24.96
anaerobic stuff with some resistance to be ready for Sopsie. So I was I was good to go.

441
00:40:24.96 --> 00:40:30.88
And now Sopsie when you get there, is it starting to start to approach what you have in mind?

442
00:40:30.88 --> 00:40:35.68
Yeah, it definitely was. I mean, the way Sopsie was back then, I think it was five or six weeks,

443
00:40:35.68 --> 00:40:40.08
and you would stay at Fort Bragg, and then you'd go down to Fort Campbell on Monday,

444
00:40:40.08 --> 00:40:44.000
and you would train and be in Sopsie Monday through Friday, and then you would come back to

445
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.60
Bragg for the weekend, and you would just do that for six weeks. And it was just a lot of PT,

446
00:40:48.32 --> 00:40:53.28
land nav, like not tying some SF history stuff, but it was mostly physical to get you ready for

447
00:40:53.28 --> 00:41:00.48
selection. Well, at the end of the first week, so it's Friday, one week, week one is done. And now

448
00:41:00.48 --> 00:41:04.56
I'm feeling like I'm playing the game with like, with like the big boys, I got SF guys that are

449
00:41:04.56 --> 00:41:09.28
now my cadrates and my first time being introduced to them. I'm surrounded by a bunch of x-rays.

450
00:41:10.16 --> 00:41:15.20
I'm like, okay, now I feel like I'm in the game. That first week ends, and our lead instructor

451
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:20.80
comes down, he says, all right, check it out. The upcoming selection class has some open slots.

452
00:41:20.80 --> 00:41:28.08
So we're going to send volunteers, or we're going to just force those that are in the top 10%

453
00:41:28.08 --> 00:41:33.92
performance wise to go and it starts on Monday. I raise my hand immediately. I'm like, yep,

454
00:41:33.92 --> 00:41:38.96
I'm good. I'm ready to go. Like, let's go. My confidence was really high. So it gave me a

455
00:41:38.96 --> 00:41:43.36
weekend to just get my stuff ready, my equipment, make sure I had everything I needed, which I did

456
00:41:43.36 --> 00:41:48.24
because I was proud of Sopsie. So my Sopsie experience was five days. And then I was in

457
00:41:48.24 --> 00:41:52.24
an SFAS to follow in Monday. And how was how was that selection?

458
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:02.08
Selection when I went through was was 14 days long. Now it's back to 20 or so. It was 2021 for a

459
00:42:02.08 --> 00:42:09.04
long time. And then mine was the second class after they condensed it down into 14. I can't tell you

460
00:42:09.04 --> 00:42:13.92
why they did that. But you would think that that meant they removed like five or six days worth of

461
00:42:13.92 --> 00:42:20.08
stuff, but they didn't. They just rammed it into a shorter window. So there was no like white space

462
00:42:20.08 --> 00:42:24.64
in between stuff. Everything was just it was much more intense, because you still had to check all

463
00:42:24.64 --> 00:42:32.000
these blocks, but just in a week, less of time. What percentage of attrition comes from that

464
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:42.56
selection? Yeah, so the time I went, we started with around 300 or so candidates. And around 100

465
00:42:42.56 --> 00:42:52.48
made it to the end. And then they selected around 40 or so. God, see, that seems like a freaking

466
00:42:52.48 --> 00:42:58.72
crazy roll of the dice. If you're joining the army to be a SF guy, that you can go through the

467
00:42:58.72 --> 00:43:02.24
training and they can just be like, yeah, you're not what we're looking for. Is that what it is?

468
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:08.000
Yeah, I mean, they, you know, I have some buddies that are selection cadre now and some that have

469
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.04
been and now are back to the unit. You know, they make it as objective as I think they can, but

470
00:43:13.04 --> 00:43:17.28
it's open to subjectivity because there are human beings that are evaluating you. And when,

471
00:43:17.92 --> 00:43:23.60
if you're looking at purely physical capability, like how fast did you run two miles? That's

472
00:43:23.60 --> 00:43:27.52
subjective. How many pushups can you do pull ups, whatever. But when you're evaluating people for

473
00:43:28.16 --> 00:43:33.36
leadership and their ability to work in a team dynamic, that gets subjective pretty quick. So

474
00:43:33.36 --> 00:43:39.20
it is a roll of the dice to a degree because you may just have a bad, may have a bad day or bad week.

475
00:43:39.20 --> 00:43:43.12
You're a solid leader, you're a solid performer, you just didn't perform when you needed to. And

476
00:43:43.12 --> 00:43:49.44
that's what the cadre had to go off of. So yeah, you didn't make this round, but come back and try

477
00:43:49.44 --> 00:43:55.68
again. How long do you have to wait before you can come back and try it in? I think it's, I want to

478
00:43:55.68 --> 00:44:00.56
say it's like six months. No, it's not too bad. I think it's like six months. Were there guys that

479
00:44:00.56 --> 00:44:04.40
you thought were like, oh, that guy seems like good to go and he didn't make it, didn't get selected.

480
00:44:04.40 --> 00:44:10.80
Yeah. Yeah, a few, a few of my buddies that were actually in basic with me that made it all the

481
00:44:10.80 --> 00:44:15.04
way to Sobsi that came with me with that first chunk because there were like 10 of us that left

482
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:20.64
Sobsi early. They maybe five of us got selected that first class. And the other five I would have

483
00:44:20.64 --> 00:44:24.64
said, no, no, these guys are, these guys are going to be good to go. I was mostly looking at their

484
00:44:24.64 --> 00:44:28.56
physical performance, like their rock times and their pull ups and they're like, these were physical

485
00:44:28.56 --> 00:44:34.08
studs. But for whatever reason, they just didn't, they display what they needed to do.

486
00:44:34.08 --> 00:44:37.84
Do the cadre debrief a guy and be like, Hey, man, you were definitely not in the

487
00:44:37.84 --> 00:44:41.76
game over here. You felt short. Look like you had a big ego. Do they debrief guys?

488
00:44:42.80 --> 00:44:50.24
No, damn. No, it's the cadre during selection are like robots. They're not, they're not in your

489
00:44:50.24 --> 00:44:53.92
face. They're not screaming and yelling. There's a couple of times that they're screaming and yelling.

490
00:44:53.92 --> 00:45:00.24
Log and rifle PT are two iterations where they are in your face and screaming and trying to crack you

491
00:45:00.24 --> 00:45:05.44
physically and emotionally, mentally. But the rest, they're like cyborgs. It's very just,

492
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.40
here's where you this is your task. This is your condition. This is your standard. Do you have

493
00:45:10.40 --> 00:45:14.88
any questions? Execute. That's it. And if you, if you don't make it, they're like, okay, go over there.

494
00:45:14.88 --> 00:45:20.40
There's nothing. They're not trying to, they're not trying to get you to quit. And they're also not

495
00:45:20.40 --> 00:45:27.60
that a tell you why you don't get picked up or why you failed an event. They're like cyborgs.

496
00:45:29.04 --> 00:45:36.000
That's wild. Cause it seems like in buds, really the whole first phase is to weed people out,

497
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.40
but most of it happens the first, second, third, fourth week, the fourth week is the fourth or

498
00:45:40.40 --> 00:45:46.000
fifth week, depending is, is hell week, you know, and they'll get rid of so many people. But, uh,

499
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.72
uh, yeah, that objectivity, I guess it happens a little bit different in buds, you know, like the

500
00:45:52.72 --> 00:45:58.88
instructors will see someone that's weak and they'll kind of like, they'll start working on them and

501
00:45:58.88 --> 00:46:06.56
they'll just break him. And that'll be that. Um, was there anything that was a challenge for you

502
00:46:06.56 --> 00:46:11.20
in this stuff? Cause you're like a freaking government experiment. Was there anything that

503
00:46:11.20 --> 00:46:16.24
was hard for you in selection? Yeah. Selection was certainly challenging. Um, I think what I

504
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:23.44
struggled most with was the team dynamic aspect. Although I grew up playing team sports, you

505
00:46:23.44 --> 00:46:28.48
know, you, you get put in these, in these scenarios where you have a mission to execute as a small

506
00:46:28.48 --> 00:46:32.80
group and they'll rotate who's in charge, you're in charge of this, you're in charge of that.

507
00:46:33.36 --> 00:46:36.88
And that's where they're assessing you as leaders, but they're also assessing

508
00:46:36.88 --> 00:46:42.000
everyone else as a team player and their ability to support a leader, right?

509
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.20
To kind of lead up the chain of command kind of philosophy. Well, as an aggressive,

510
00:46:49.84 --> 00:46:54.64
younger person, as if a leader made a decision on how we're going to execute something and I

511
00:46:54.64 --> 00:46:59.92
didn't agree with it. I made that note. I'm like, no, that's, that's not going to work. Like I wanted

512
00:46:59.92 --> 00:47:05.92
to win. And these tasks that they're given to us, they're essentially impossible. Like within the

513
00:47:05.92 --> 00:47:09.52
standards that are given to you, there's no way it's happening. They know that it's not about,

514
00:47:09.52 --> 00:47:13.12
can you get from A to B in the lot of time? It's about how do you work together as a unit?

515
00:47:13.12 --> 00:47:16.48
How do you lead? How do you communicate? How do you problem solve? How do you deal with stress?

516
00:47:17.04 --> 00:47:22.32
That's what they're looking at. I wanted to win. And if homeboy came back with some like crazy,

517
00:47:22.32 --> 00:47:26.24
ridiculous strategy that I knew wouldn't work, I let him know that I'm like, no, no, no, that's not

518
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:30.40
going to work. And now this dude's in like a tough spot. He's like dealing with someone who's like

519
00:47:30.40 --> 00:47:36.16
bigger than him and angrier than him. And he's trying to do his job as a leader. And of course,

520
00:47:36.16 --> 00:47:41.68
he's being evaluated, the cashier standing right there. So I could have done a better job

521
00:47:41.68 --> 00:47:48.56
of being a supportive member of the team. I didn't have the same leadership philosophy and

522
00:47:48.56 --> 00:47:53.76
methodology and tools that I have now. So I struggled with that because even in the moments,

523
00:47:53.76 --> 00:47:59.44
I could tell like, I'm not handling this very well, but I want to win. And it's just, it's

524
00:47:59.44 --> 00:48:04.48
superseded my ability to stay calm and tactful. Did they debrief you on that or you just figured

525
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:09.68
this out later? No, they did. So if you get selected, you sit down with a cadre after and

526
00:48:09.68 --> 00:48:15.04
they go through your entire, your entire packet with all your scores and all their inputs. So that

527
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:21.44
was the number one thing that that was told to me was you need to learn how to be more supportive

528
00:48:21.44 --> 00:48:29.52
of a leader. That's legit. Yeah. Give you some legit feedback. And you, were you humble enough to

529
00:48:29.52 --> 00:48:36.56
understand that at the time? I was humble enough to accept it. I didn't have the same mentality

530
00:48:36.56 --> 00:48:42.72
towards leadership then as I do now, where now I look as leadership as very much a skill. Like,

531
00:48:42.72 --> 00:48:47.68
it's something that you can learn, but you have to deliberately train on it. Back then, even, even

532
00:48:47.68 --> 00:48:53.44
at that point, so I'm now 25, I just got selected, whatever. I still looked at leadership as, as a

533
00:48:53.44 --> 00:48:59.12
talent as something that you either had or didn't have. And that was it. So I just took it like,

534
00:48:59.12 --> 00:49:05.76
Roger that, Sergeant, I appreciate it. But like, this is who I am. And I don't have the leadership

535
00:49:05.76 --> 00:49:10.000
like skill ingrained in me genetically, I just don't have it. So I'm gonna have to get better

536
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.68
other ways to kind of make up the difference. Now I look, you know, my mentality towards it is wildly

537
00:49:15.68 --> 00:49:20.000
different. Yeah. No, that's a, that's a, a lot of people make that, or a lot of people have that

538
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.48
attitude. And, you know, at, we have a leadership consulting company and explaining to people that

539
00:49:24.48 --> 00:49:30.32
they can actually learn skills, just like, I guess, at the example I was used as playing guitar or

540
00:49:30.32 --> 00:49:34.48
shooting baskets and basketball, like you can't just pick up a basketball and be think you can make

541
00:49:34.48 --> 00:49:37.44
free throws. It's like not happening. You can't pick up a guitar and just think you're going to be

542
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:42.80
able to play. You get skill and leadership is the same way. And are there some people that have a

543
00:49:42.80 --> 00:49:46.16
little bit of a tendency that have better hand-eye coordination that they're going to be able to pick

544
00:49:46.16 --> 00:49:51.12
up basketball a little bit quicker? Yeah. Are there people that have a certain ability to recognize

545
00:49:51.12 --> 00:49:57.12
different notes when they hear them? Yeah. That's an actual thing you can be born with. But regardless,

546
00:49:57.12 --> 00:50:01.04
you still need to learn the skills in order to get good at it. Leadership's the same way. You're

547
00:50:01.04 --> 00:50:04.64
going to have some natural propensity for it. There's going to be some parts of it you'll be

548
00:50:04.64 --> 00:50:08.16
good at. There's going to be some parts you'll suck at. You take advantage of the ones you're good

549
00:50:08.16 --> 00:50:13.36
at. You work on the ones you're not. But it's definitely everyone can get better unless they're

550
00:50:13.36 --> 00:50:16.96
a person that says, I already know everything. Right. And then they're going to be a problem.

551
00:50:18.72 --> 00:50:24.24
So then it's off to Q-course after that? Yep. Get selected, go into Q-course. And back then,

552
00:50:24.24 --> 00:50:28.56
it's different today. But back then, you go through these different phases, phase one,

553
00:50:28.56 --> 00:50:34.88
two, three, four. And in between those, you would just be waiting at Fort Bragg for there to be

554
00:50:34.88 --> 00:50:39.76
enough students that they could lump together to start the next phase. So a lot of white space in

555
00:50:39.76 --> 00:50:44.40
between. You know, phase one, you go to Down to Camp McCall, you're there for three weeks, seven

556
00:50:44.40 --> 00:50:50.64
weeks, whatever. Come back to Bragg and reset. Well, sometimes those breaks could be a month or

557
00:50:50.64 --> 00:50:56.72
three months. Right. What do you do during those breaks? Just working out? PT formations. They do

558
00:50:56.72 --> 00:51:01.44
like some LPD stuff with some of the tax that were back there at Bragg, the guys that were like in

559
00:51:01.44 --> 00:51:06.56
charge of us keeping accountability. So we do some like leadership type classes. But you were

560
00:51:06.56 --> 00:51:10.56
mostly just hanging out waiting, trying to stay out of trouble. And that's where actually a lot

561
00:51:10.56 --> 00:51:14.40
of guys, that's the reason why they're not green berets today is because of that downtime.

562
00:51:15.12 --> 00:51:17.68
You know, there's plenty of distractions in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

563
00:51:17.68 --> 00:51:22.72
God. Plenty. There's plenty. They're all actually, they're all there. All the vices and distractions

564
00:51:22.72 --> 00:51:29.12
that you could want or hope didn't exist. They're all there. Girls, drugs, booze, nightlife, fights.

565
00:51:29.12 --> 00:51:35.60
That is what got a lot of guys removed from the program because they just couldn't stay focused

566
00:51:35.60 --> 00:51:42.32
for that amount of time because it took me just the Q course alone about 18 months.

567
00:51:42.32 --> 00:51:45.68
Oh, no kidding. To get through it. Yeah. And how much of that time was it?

568
00:51:46.32 --> 00:51:52.64
Maybe just just, yeah. How much was actually training? Maybe 12. Wow. Yeah. Well, when you were

569
00:51:52.64 --> 00:51:57.28
going through that, was there anything that was trouble for you in there? Language school. Real

570
00:51:57.28 --> 00:52:03.04
hot. Yeah. Yeah. Language school is hot. What language did you learn? I learned Russian in the

571
00:52:03.04 --> 00:52:08.32
Q course, which was six months long. Do they have Rs in Russian? They have the Rs sound in Russian?

572
00:52:08.32 --> 00:52:14.56
They do, but I don't pass a shit. You talk about a confusing accent. You mix Russian and Boston

573
00:52:14.56 --> 00:52:20.40
together. Literally no one knows what I'm saying, including me. So everyone's left lost. What did

574
00:52:20.40 --> 00:52:27.68
you just say? I don't think I even know. That was tough. How long was the Russian course? Six months.

575
00:52:28.24 --> 00:52:33.28
And that's all you do. Eight hours a day. Headset on. Freakin. They don't speak English to you.

576
00:52:33.28 --> 00:52:39.12
We got instructors. So you're in a classroom with like six, seven other guys. Eight hours a day,

577
00:52:39.12 --> 00:52:44.96
just learning Russian. And it was even worse because we still to maintain our jump status

578
00:52:44.96 --> 00:52:49.84
during the Q course. So we did a jump like the week before I started language school.

579
00:52:49.84 --> 00:52:56.40
And I broke my tailbone. I broke my coxsus. I came down, I landed on the runway.

580
00:52:56.40 --> 00:53:01.44
Bro, those shoots are not made for big dudes. No, man. I come down like an asteroid.

581
00:53:01.44 --> 00:53:05.84
I always did too. Especially with equipment. I mean, I forgot about it. It's just a freaking

582
00:53:05.84 --> 00:53:11.76
disaster. Even at 1,300 feet. It's like by the time I shoot opens, I check my stuff. I drop my

583
00:53:11.76 --> 00:53:16.08
equipment pretty much immediately and I'm smashing into the earth with a vapor trail behind me.

584
00:53:16.08 --> 00:53:22.000
You know, so I came down. I had some wind. I couldn't steer. Couldn't avoid it runway.

585
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.16
This is happening. Boom. Broke my tailbone. I thought I paralyzed. I thought it was

586
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:30.16
freaking horrible. It was scary. Guys have been paralyzed from that type of accident.

587
00:53:30.16 --> 00:53:34.80
Yeah. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I'm like, okay, this is the rest of my life.

588
00:53:35.44 --> 00:53:40.24
Fortunately, it was just a broken tailbone, which is not a convenient injury.

589
00:53:40.88 --> 00:53:45.44
You know, never had it, but it doesn't sound like there's no great. You can't cast it,

590
00:53:45.44 --> 00:53:49.04
you know, so you just have to stay off of it and let it kind of heal the best they can.

591
00:53:49.04 --> 00:53:52.08
But I'm immediately going into language school where I'm going to be spending

592
00:53:52.08 --> 00:53:58.48
eight hours a day in a classroom. So my first, I don't know, three, four months of language school,

593
00:53:58.48 --> 00:54:04.80
I was either on a knee or standing because I couldn't sit. You know, eventually I was coming

594
00:54:04.80 --> 00:54:08.80
to class one of those donuts, you know, those inflatable things. So I was doing so. I mean,

595
00:54:08.80 --> 00:54:16.88
I also, not an academic, trying to learn a new language, which I'm convinced is in the same area

596
00:54:16.88 --> 00:54:21.84
of the artistic side of people's brains. Like if you can play music or if you can paint,

597
00:54:22.48 --> 00:54:26.88
that's the art form of learning a language. My wife's a great example. She's both like,

598
00:54:26.88 --> 00:54:31.92
she's a musician. She's a phenomenal artist. She can pick up foreign languages like that. For me,

599
00:54:31.92 --> 00:54:39.04
nah, dude, it was brutal. It was just forced reps. Like that's how you do it. So I mean,

600
00:54:39.04 --> 00:54:42.48
and you have to test out, you have to test out like a certain level. Yeah,

601
00:54:42.48 --> 00:54:46.64
you're gonna test out what you're gonna test out at. What I would say would be like a,

602
00:54:47.12 --> 00:54:53.92
like a between a beginner and a novice level to have a working knowledge, I think is the

603
00:54:53.92 --> 00:54:58.40
way they kind of describe it. Where is that language school for practice?

604
00:54:58.40 --> 00:55:03.68
Jack, what, what, what were you, you were a 18 Bravo? Were you a Bravo?

605
00:55:03.68 --> 00:55:06.24
I was a Bravo. And how was that part of the schooling?

606
00:55:06.24 --> 00:55:10.80
That was great. Now the Bravo course was awesome. You know, just learning weapons and

607
00:55:11.36 --> 00:55:15.20
a little bit into tactics, but you're just playing with guns all day.

608
00:55:15.20 --> 00:55:16.64
Did you pick that? Is that what you wanted?

609
00:55:16.64 --> 00:55:22.16
Yeah. So I picked my, I picked my MOS and my language, which determines your group.

610
00:55:22.16 --> 00:55:26.16
Everyone that gets selected, or at least back then, picked those two things,

611
00:55:26.16 --> 00:55:31.68
requested MOS and requested language. And they would give, I think it was the top,

612
00:55:31.68 --> 00:55:36.72
like 15% or 20% of the performers would get what they, what they asked for. And then the

613
00:55:36.72 --> 00:55:41.52
rest would get whatever they, you know, they needed to get. So I requested Bravo and I wanted

614
00:55:41.52 --> 00:55:44.40
Russian cause I wanted to stay at that third group.

615
00:55:44.40 --> 00:55:45.92
What made you want to be Bravo?

616
00:55:47.28 --> 00:55:53.12
They're the ass kickers on the team, you know, stereotypically, but also in reality,

617
00:55:53.12 --> 00:55:58.24
because you kind of, you kind of have to be, man. And here's why you're, yes, you train

618
00:55:59.12 --> 00:56:04.48
on weapons and maintenance and troubleshooting, but you're also the primary tactician on the

619
00:56:04.48 --> 00:56:09.52
team or the primary tech tactical advisor to the team sergeant is that, you know, that's your

620
00:56:09.52 --> 00:56:13.44
support function on a team. So you're putting together ranges, you're executing training.

621
00:56:14.16 --> 00:56:22.16
Well, every SF guy, every soft guy thinks that he is a perfect tactician and a perfect

622
00:56:22.16 --> 00:56:31.12
marksman. The other skill sets, medics, commo demo, those are much easier for those guys to

623
00:56:31.12 --> 00:56:36.72
teach their teammates because they don't have the pride associated with not knowing medicine.

624
00:56:36.72 --> 00:56:40.64
I don't have the pride associated with not knowing how to use this, this radio.

625
00:56:41.28 --> 00:56:43.76
You walk up to a guy and say, you don't know how to use your rifle.

626
00:56:44.64 --> 00:56:48.80
That they don't take that very well. So you have to have an aggressive, dominant

627
00:56:48.80 --> 00:56:55.20
personality to be able to break through that barrier that your teammates have to be able to

628
00:56:55.20 --> 00:57:01.04
do your job. Yeah, they're going to take that very personally. They don't like that. You know,

629
00:57:01.04 --> 00:57:07.04
I don't like that. Like you're, you can't shoot and you don't understand tactics. You tell that to

630
00:57:07.04 --> 00:57:11.36
a green beret or seal or a ranger that it's not going to go well. Yeah, they're going to have

631
00:57:11.36 --> 00:57:16.24
that stuff. They're going to have a little bit of an eco flare in those scenarios. And how was,

632
00:57:16.24 --> 00:57:21.92
how was Robin Sage? Robin Sage was good. I mean, aside from the infill, which is,

633
00:57:21.92 --> 00:57:27.20
it's just, I mean, horrible. We didn't jump. Thank God. My buddies, who's a good buddy of mine

634
00:57:27.20 --> 00:57:32.08
today, he was on one of the teams that had to jump in because you're, everyone on that, on that team

635
00:57:32.08 --> 00:57:38.48
is carrying about 120 pounds in their rock to, you know, sustain off of, to conduct

636
00:57:38.48 --> 00:57:43.52
unconventional warfare in a denied area. That's what Robin Sage is. The teams that have to jump in,

637
00:57:43.52 --> 00:57:50.40
man, not, not, not dude. If I jump in without equipment, I'm coming in hot. Yeah. You throw

638
00:57:50.40 --> 00:57:56.08
120 pounds on me. So I'm going to put a mark in the earth, putting dent in the earth. Yeah.

639
00:57:57.60 --> 00:58:01.44
So fortunately, I didn't have to jump, but you know, the infill, the infill is tough,

640
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.72
no matter whether you jump in or not, you're humping miles through North Carolina.

641
00:58:06.72 --> 00:58:13.28
But once you get past that, then you're actually operating with other MOS's,

642
00:58:13.28 --> 00:58:19.52
which is the first time that you get to see that because it's the last thing you do and they bring,

643
00:58:19.52 --> 00:58:24.08
so now you can see what medics do. You can see what the 18 childlies do. You can see what the

644
00:58:24.08 --> 00:58:30.48
commo guys can do. You see the, the alphas, you see the team leaders up until you go to MOS,

645
00:58:30.48 --> 00:58:35.36
everyone's just a candidate. Then you learn your job and then you come together to execute your job

646
00:58:35.36 --> 00:58:40.80
with the other team, with the other MOS's. So I remember just when we were on infill, I started

647
00:58:40.80 --> 00:58:45.28
cramping up and I needed to take a short halt because I needed to stretch because otherwise

648
00:58:45.28 --> 00:58:51.28
I was going to go down and one of my teammates yelled the word medic, which is the first time I

649
00:58:51.28 --> 00:58:55.60
had heard that, like in real life, you're going to hear the movies, but someone actually yelled

650
00:58:55.60 --> 00:59:00.96
medic and then a medic showed up and I was like, Oh, this is like a real thing. We actually have

651
00:59:00.96 --> 00:59:05.68
you guys. I hadn't seen it before. So it was cool to see those different jobs and how they

652
00:59:05.68 --> 00:59:09.68
employed themselves within a team dynamic. So it was actually a lot of fun once you got past,

653
00:59:09.68 --> 00:59:13.44
you know, getting to your, your site. How long is the freaking infill?

654
00:59:14.64 --> 00:59:20.72
It usually takes, you know, like two to three days to get in. Yeah. I mean, every, every route's

655
00:59:20.72 --> 00:59:25.60
different. It's usually, it's trains, planes, and automobiles and a lot of walking. So, you know,

656
00:59:25.60 --> 00:59:30.72
horse trailer from here to here, you get there, you walk, you know, 12 miles through the wood line,

657
00:59:30.72 --> 00:59:35.12
link up over here, jump on a boat, move down this river, you know, it's like a full on

658
00:59:36.72 --> 00:59:40.56
infill as if you're going into actual denied area. That's what they try to replicate.

659
00:59:41.44 --> 00:59:45.60
You get done with that. That's it, right? That's when you get your, your designation,

660
00:59:45.60 --> 00:59:50.64
your green beret. That's it. Yeah. Did your parents come down for that? Oh, yeah. Did your mom put

661
00:59:50.64 --> 00:59:57.04
any crystals in your green beret? She probably did. She blew some incense on me. Do you have like

662
00:59:57.04 --> 01:00:04.08
one green beret that you got that one time? Like, and that's the one that you get and the one that

663
01:00:04.08 --> 01:00:09.20
you keep? The actual headgear? Yeah. So I still have the same one is the one I graduated with.

664
01:00:09.20 --> 01:00:15.20
Right. So that's, is that pretty common? I think that that's most common unless a guy like loses

665
01:00:15.20 --> 01:00:20.88
it. We don't really wear it that often though. So there's, there's no real need to upgrade because

666
01:00:20.88 --> 01:00:26.24
you like destroyed it. It's, it's kind of funny, man. You spend all this time thinking about becoming

667
01:00:26.24 --> 01:00:30.64
one and you want to earn this little green hat more than anything. So the top of this mountain,

668
01:00:30.64 --> 01:00:35.28
it means everything to you. You want to put it all on the line and then you get it and then you

669
01:00:35.28 --> 01:00:40.16
never want to wear it because it's just a pain in the ass to put on your head. So we don't usually

670
01:00:40.16 --> 01:00:46.16
wear a uniform all that often anyway, but when we do, obviously it goes on. So I think that's

671
01:00:46.16 --> 01:00:49.84
part of the reason why most guys, the one that they had originally is the one that they keep

672
01:00:49.84 --> 01:00:56.24
throughout their career. Yeah. No uniform is always not fun. I remember I always thought to myself,

673
01:00:56.24 --> 01:01:02.64
man, I'm like a, I'm like a 30, 35, 38 year old dude. I go to work all day. I don't have to wear a

674
01:01:02.64 --> 01:01:08.88
shirt man. This is the, this is the life. Freaking good to go. Yeah. But your parents came down to

675
01:01:08.88 --> 01:01:15.36
graduation and all that. Absolutely. How they feel about that. Cause now what year is it? 2010.

676
01:01:16.80 --> 01:01:24.56
Okay. So Iraq is kind of chilled out by now. So you must just be eyeing Afghanistan at this point.

677
01:01:24.56 --> 01:01:28.72
Yeah. So at this point, I know I'm going to third group, which is at Bragg, which is the one I wanted

678
01:01:28.72 --> 01:01:34.08
to go to because third group owned Afghanistan for that, for the groups, for the SF groups. That's

679
01:01:34.08 --> 01:01:40.000
all third group did. The other groups would filter in and support, but third group owned Afghanistan.

680
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.92
That's where I wanted to go. That's why I chose that language. That's where I ended up going. So

681
01:01:45.12 --> 01:01:51.60
from my parents perspective, of course, they were proud of the work and happy for me for being

682
01:01:51.60 --> 01:01:57.60
successful, but also petrified because they knew what was coming. And this was 2010. You joined

683
01:01:57.60 --> 01:02:03.84
in 2007. Damn. That's a long freaking pipeline. Yeah. Yeah. That's a long pipeline. Now it's much

684
01:02:03.84 --> 01:02:09.12
more streamlined. So the current Q course, they've cut that white space in between. So they give

685
01:02:09.12 --> 01:02:15.12
guides, maybe it's a week or two or so off and it's, it's a much faster turnover rate. Got it.

686
01:02:15.12 --> 01:02:22.72
Yeah. So you get, how was it checking into, to the battalion? It was, I mean, I showed up,

687
01:02:22.72 --> 01:02:28.24
never having been in like a real unit before, other than as a student. And you don't get a whole lot

688
01:02:28.24 --> 01:02:33.04
of guidance. It's like report the third group on this day. It's like over there somewhere. I'm like,

689
01:02:33.04 --> 01:02:38.40
okay. So you find it, right? And then I walk into like group headquarters building and there's like

690
01:02:38.40 --> 01:02:44.32
some E five work in the CQ desk. And I'm like, hi, I'm here to report to first battalion. He's like,

691
01:02:44.32 --> 01:02:51.04
okay, it's over there. I'm like, all right, Roger that. So like I meander over there. And the funny

692
01:02:51.04 --> 01:02:57.20
the funny story is I'm walking around the battalion, trying to get all these little boxes checked off,

693
01:02:57.20 --> 01:03:01.44
right? Check in with S one, which is your admin section, check in with S two, your intel section,

694
01:03:01.44 --> 01:03:08.48
like get yourself administratively within the unit. I've never heard of S four. I don't know where it

695
01:03:08.48 --> 01:03:14.56
is. Like what's okay, it's over here. I find it. What do I need from you guys? So I'm meandering

696
01:03:14.56 --> 01:03:19.60
around pretty lost. Clearly I was lost because a dude comes up to me and P T's and he's like,

697
01:03:19.60 --> 01:03:23.92
can you help find something? And I'm like, yeah, man, I'm looking for this like S six thing. He's

698
01:03:23.92 --> 01:03:27.76
like, yeah, it's over there. And as soon as I start talking, he's like, you from Boston? I'm like,

699
01:03:27.76 --> 01:03:32.16
yeah, he's like, I'm from Boston. I'm like, Oh, no kidding. So we start talking about the socks and

700
01:03:32.16 --> 01:03:35.92
the paths and where you're from, which neighborhood, whatever, we're just like, bullshit. And then

701
01:03:35.92 --> 01:03:40.88
he's like, come on, let me show you something. Following this guy. No idea who it is. He brings

702
01:03:40.88 --> 01:03:48.000
me into an office. He's got red socks, pictures on the walls, all this memorabilia. We're just,

703
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.64
we're chopping it up. And I realize I'm in the battalion commander's office. I haven't dropped a

704
01:03:54.64 --> 01:04:01.04
single sir. Yeah, I have no idea I'm talking to him. And it's like dawning on me. And I'm like,

705
01:04:01.04 --> 01:04:04.72
all right, but I'm just going to keep going with this because like, he seems cool with it. Maybe

706
01:04:04.72 --> 01:04:10.48
this is just the way it is. I don't know. It's my first day in the unit. And then I just hear this

707
01:04:10.48 --> 01:04:18.56
bellowing voice from the office next to it. And this was Sajam Major Spratt command, Sajam

708
01:04:18.56 --> 01:04:25.04
Major Spratt, who had just left SWIC, which is where the Q course and selection is, and came back

709
01:04:25.04 --> 01:04:32.72
to third group. And he had some specific language about, you know, asking very politely who was

710
01:04:32.72 --> 01:04:38.48
talking to the battalion commander that way. And he walked in the office and he's an old school SF

711
01:04:38.48 --> 01:04:48.40
guy, man, old school, like big mustache, big chest, right? Walks in, yelling at me. I look

712
01:04:48.40 --> 01:04:51.76
over the battalion commander like, are you going to, are you going to step in here? And he's just

713
01:04:51.76 --> 01:04:56.40
laughing. I thought we were boys. I thought we were buddies, you know? He hangs me out to dry

714
01:04:56.40 --> 01:05:01.12
completely. So Spratt's like, you know, looking at my name, he's like, I heard of you. He's like,

715
01:05:01.12 --> 01:05:05.04
you know, he's like, you're one of those combatives guys, right? You're one of those like MMA fighter

716
01:05:05.04 --> 01:05:10.64
type dudes. And I was like, I don't know if I should say yes to this. I feel like you may want to

717
01:05:10.64 --> 01:05:16.64
challenge me out back. And I don't know how that will go. I'm like, yes. Yeah, that is me. And he's

718
01:05:16.64 --> 01:05:21.76
like, okay, well, basically, don't ever talk to the boss like that again, and like, get out of here

719
01:05:21.76 --> 01:05:25.92
and like, go find your company. What gave you that reputation as being an MMA guy? Because,

720
01:05:25.92 --> 01:05:29.52
what, just because you wrestled or were you, did you pick up Jiu-Jitsu and stuff along the way?

721
01:05:29.52 --> 01:05:36.72
So I ended up getting a MacP, which is the Army Combatives Program, cert one and two during basic

722
01:05:36.72 --> 01:05:42.96
training that they offered to just like guys that were proficient with combat sports. So I showed up

723
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:51.44
to the unit that with that. And then, or during the Q-Course. And then actually, when I was in Robin

724
01:05:51.44 --> 01:06:00.48
Sage, Alan Shabaro, who's a Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt former third group SF guy, he was a cadre for a

725
01:06:00.48 --> 01:06:07.28
different field team out at Robin Sage. And he came over one night randomly and was like, hey,

726
01:06:07.84 --> 01:06:11.52
you know, I heard you're into like combatives and stuff like that, you know, come check out my gym

727
01:06:11.52 --> 01:06:15.60
once you get out of here and you graduate and whatnot. That was my intro into into Jiu-Jitsu.

728
01:06:15.60 --> 01:06:21.52
So I've been training with him a little bit before I actually showed up on day one. I just think

729
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:27.12
maybe word kind of just travel kind of quick, you know, whatever. But so that's your welcome aboard.

730
01:06:27.12 --> 01:06:30.72
You freaking bro out with the battalion commander and then get your ass chewed.

731
01:06:32.32 --> 01:06:35.28
And how long does it take for you before you get into like an ODA?

732
01:06:37.20 --> 01:06:43.44
I was on my first team probably probably a week or two after that. Because the timing was interesting.

733
01:06:43.44 --> 01:06:48.80
My entire company was forward in Afghanistan, but they only had about a month left before they were

734
01:06:48.80 --> 01:06:55.84
coming back. Every team except for one of them was forward. And there was a team that was a

735
01:06:55.84 --> 01:07:00.16
that deployed offset from the rest of the company and the battalion because it was a specialized

736
01:07:00.16 --> 01:07:06.16
team. So it took my company, Saja Major, a little bit of time, a couple days to think about

737
01:07:06.88 --> 01:07:11.28
where to put me. Because I met him that day, my very first day I made my way over the company,

738
01:07:11.28 --> 01:07:15.28
met the Saja Major, introduced himself. He said, cool, man, like, what are your goals? I said,

739
01:07:15.28 --> 01:07:19.68
I want to get in Afghanistan like now. He's like, of course you do. But like the entire company's

740
01:07:19.68 --> 01:07:22.80
coming back. It doesn't make any sense. By the time you get there and get situated,

741
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:27.36
you're going to just be packing things up and come home. So the timing's not there. But I do

742
01:07:27.36 --> 01:07:32.96
have this team that's set to go forward in a few months. I'm like, cool, can I go to that one?

743
01:07:32.96 --> 01:07:38.80
He's like, well, it's a different type of team. So like, let me think about it. He did. Eventually,

744
01:07:38.80 --> 01:07:44.32
I sat down with the team, Saja, into that team. And this team focused on preparation of the

745
01:07:44.32 --> 01:07:50.40
environment is the task that we were assigned. So kind of like left-to-bang type stuff, which

746
01:07:50.40 --> 01:07:55.52
isn't exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to go kick down doors and shoot bad guys in the face.

747
01:07:55.52 --> 01:08:01.28
This team was not designed to do that. But it was more designed to find the bad guy so that

748
01:08:01.28 --> 01:08:06.40
someone can go kick him in the face. It's designed to facilitate the door kickers to get to the guy

749
01:08:06.40 --> 01:08:12.80
or get to the area. So I mean, it was that type of work. And it was a very senior team because

750
01:08:12.80 --> 01:08:17.84
most guys would go spend a few years on a standard ODA and then they would migrate over into this

751
01:08:17.84 --> 01:08:23.44
type of stuff. So senior dudes. But eventually, that's the route that I went when I was on that

752
01:08:23.44 --> 01:08:27.76
team within a couple weeks of getting a group. I mean, I'm just going to say, you're a new

753
01:08:27.76 --> 01:08:32.88
guy. You're checking in. You get a chance to go to Afghanistan in a more rapid manner. They could

754
01:08:32.88 --> 01:08:36.40
probably told you like, hey, we need to cook to go to Afghanistan. A month you'd have been like,

755
01:08:36.40 --> 01:08:41.52
I'm in. At least I know I would have been. I'm like, cool. Where's the freaking spatula?

756
01:08:41.52 --> 01:08:49.20
Where's the ladle? Yeah. Let's do this. Did you have any time to like prep? Was there any

757
01:08:49.20 --> 01:08:53.68
type of workup or are they already done with all that? No, there was a workup. I think maybe,

758
01:08:53.68 --> 01:08:57.92
yeah, like I said, I think I was on the team about four months before we infilled. So I went

759
01:08:57.92 --> 01:09:03.92
and I learned Dari, which is a prominent language of Afghanistan. So I spent six months in the Q

760
01:09:03.92 --> 01:09:08.48
course, getting my ass kicked, learning Russian, show it to my group. And they're like, welcome,

761
01:09:08.48 --> 01:09:12.64
go learn Dari. My God, kidding me. I can't get away from this language thing, man, which

762
01:09:13.44 --> 01:09:18.48
I understand the value of it now. Actually, even once I was able to employ it. So it was three months

763
01:09:18.48 --> 01:09:25.84
of that. And then some like preparatory collective training that we did. But it was pretty fast and

764
01:09:25.84 --> 01:09:31.92
furious before I was out the door. And then you, how was that deployment? What was it like when

765
01:09:31.92 --> 01:09:40.24
you got there? It was amazing. You know, initially, I wanted to come in, do my five year contract,

766
01:09:40.24 --> 01:09:45.20
get some payback for 9 11, learn some skills and then get out. This was not going to be

767
01:09:45.20 --> 01:09:50.40
like my profession or my career. And then I got to the ground, I got on the ground in Afghanistan.

768
01:09:50.40 --> 01:09:55.52
It was a nine month rotation, mostly down in Kandahar. We were mostly doing split team

769
01:09:55.52 --> 01:10:00.96
stuff. So one team was on the packy border and the other team was in like downtown Kandahar. So

770
01:10:00.96 --> 01:10:06.32
I was getting a chance to see more rural and urban environment. And because of the team I was on, I

771
01:10:06.32 --> 01:10:12.72
was seeing the more overt stuff where we get in like mounted gun trucks to go support a particular

772
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:18.72
op to being in a soft skin Corolla driving through downtown Kandahar and just very close. So I was

773
01:10:18.72 --> 01:10:25.92
exposed to a lot of what ODAs can do, what SF guys can do aside from the thing I really wanted to do.

774
01:10:26.48 --> 01:10:31.04
You know, so we didn't get into a couple little things somewhat by accident, but

775
01:10:32.48 --> 01:10:38.000
it was in that deployment that I couldn't imagine doing anything else. I decided like this is what

776
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.44
I'm going to do for my career. And I reenlisted actually in Afghanistan for like another six,

777
01:10:43.44 --> 01:10:50.96
I think it was beyond my current contract I was on. So it was great. So was the op tempo good

778
01:10:50.96 --> 01:10:56.48
where you were working all the time? Busy. Busy. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, like sitting around for

779
01:10:56.48 --> 01:11:00.32
a long period of time. You were getting after it all the time. No, no, it was it was super busy.

780
01:11:00.88 --> 01:11:06.40
And that's cool. You get out get exposed to a wide spectrum of different things that are happening.

781
01:11:06.40 --> 01:11:10.64
You get to see a lot. Yeah. That's a freaking great first deployment for you. Yeah. And I was

782
01:11:10.64 --> 01:11:16.48
again, I was with all these senior guys. So I was an E five and everyone else was E seven or eight

783
01:11:16.48 --> 01:11:22.08
or an officer. So I'm just learning from these dudes that have been around for a really long time.

784
01:11:22.08 --> 01:11:27.60
And you know, some of them were on their fifth, sixth Afghanistan pump. So I'm just I'm drinking

785
01:11:27.60 --> 01:11:33.12
from a fire hose, but just the knowledge that was coming in from these dudes, it just

786
01:11:33.68 --> 01:11:36.64
got caught the bug. And I was like, yeah, this is it. This is this is for me.

787
01:11:36.64 --> 01:11:43.68
You get done with that deployment. You said you've gotten us some things. I mean,

788
01:11:43.68 --> 01:11:47.04
you get you get in some gunfights. You guys got a few gunfights over there on that one.

789
01:11:47.04 --> 01:11:53.52
Yeah. Yeah. But not nothing that like was too major. No, no, it was nothing anything all that

790
01:11:53.52 --> 01:11:59.12
serious. But what's what's funny about it is because the mission that we were on is not designed

791
01:11:59.12 --> 01:12:04.48
for us to be in those environments. But you know, there would be like a Lurse unit or like

792
01:12:04.48 --> 01:12:09.68
a another unit over here that was going out to this area for whatever mission they had. And we're

793
01:12:09.68 --> 01:12:13.60
like, well, maybe there's something out there we can check out that isn't lying with that mission.

794
01:12:13.60 --> 01:12:17.28
I don't know. Maybe I can talk to someone over there. Maybe there's something.

795
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.88
So we would just get added on to their car and then some things would happen. But because of

796
01:12:24.88 --> 01:12:29.76
our team and our reporting channels, it was different than the other units in the AO.

797
01:12:29.76 --> 01:12:34.80
So even though we had been in these engagements, there was no like reporting of it happening.

798
01:12:35.68 --> 01:12:41.04
At one point, the commander that we actually worked for heard about some stuff and he showed

799
01:12:41.04 --> 01:12:48.88
up to our site. We were working under NSW. So like, it was a CO05 that showed up. And he's like,

800
01:12:49.68 --> 01:12:53.20
has everything going about first time I met him? He's like, okay, so just so you know,

801
01:12:53.20 --> 01:13:02.32
I know what you guys are doing. And you need to stop. Trying to keep the boys trying to keep

802
01:13:02.32 --> 01:13:10.000
the boys down. Come on. So you come home from that deployment. What's next? A ton of schools and

803
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.04
training individual schools. At that time, we were doing usually was six months on nine months off

804
01:13:17.04 --> 01:13:21.84
before we would re rotate. For me, I think it was ended up being around nine or 10. I was back in

805
01:13:21.84 --> 01:13:27.84
the States, but it was just individual school one after another. And then I went back over

806
01:13:28.72 --> 01:13:35.20
in Afghanistan for a short period of time with on a tasking from another unit that needed some

807
01:13:35.20 --> 01:13:41.20
support. And so I went over there for a quick little thing and came back and then

808
01:13:41.20 --> 01:13:44.56
like how long was that when you say a quick little thing? Was it like months or was it like

809
01:13:44.56 --> 01:13:49.12
four months? 90 days. 90 maybe 120 days somewhere between three and four months.

810
01:13:49.12 --> 01:13:56.32
All right. Now, are you still with the same ODA this whole time? Yeah. So you still are kind

811
01:13:56.32 --> 01:14:03.60
of focused on the same type of mission? Yes. Until I get back from Afghanistan. And then my company,

812
01:14:03.60 --> 01:14:09.44
Sajamajia, decides he wants to put me on a standard ODA or a direct action focused ODA. So this is

813
01:14:09.44 --> 01:14:14.72
after your second after that 90 day stint. Yeah. So on the 90 day stint, you're over there. Did you

814
01:14:14.72 --> 01:14:18.64
get some good lessons learned from that deployment? Oh yeah. What did you take back from that one?

815
01:14:20.48 --> 01:14:27.28
That there are other units within the SOCOM enterprise that operate at an entire different

816
01:14:28.16 --> 01:14:33.44
stratosphere, which I could tell even as a junior Green Beret working on, you know, around ODA,

817
01:14:33.44 --> 01:14:39.60
guys, there are other people out there that are really good at what they do and they know how to

818
01:14:39.60 --> 01:14:46.16
do it. So I was a, I was a riding on the side of this thing. They just needed some support. It was

819
01:14:46.16 --> 01:14:52.88
first PSD stuff. Okay. It came over to third group because we're on for brag and they needed like

820
01:14:52.88 --> 01:14:59.52
a bigger combatives, PSD type dude just to like take orders and not talk or ask questions. And I

821
01:14:59.52 --> 01:15:06.000
was the guy, I mean, I got this all day. I didn't know really like what I was doing. I understood

822
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.68
like PSD work, but who I was with and what we were doing. It took me like a while to like figure

823
01:15:13.68 --> 01:15:20.000
that out. But I learned a ton and that was really what sunk my teeth into what my next thing would

824
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.16
be post ODA time. Did you, are you still, are you training Jiu-Jitsu all the time now? Yeah.

825
01:15:27.68 --> 01:15:30.56
So when you got back and what about when you're on deployment, are you training at all? Do you

826
01:15:30.56 --> 01:15:37.12
have time? Oh yeah. Make time. Every trip I've been on, I've built a little fight house. Even

827
01:15:37.12 --> 01:15:41.28
into like austere stuff, we'll get into the next actual rotation. We're in the mountains

828
01:15:41.92 --> 01:15:47.36
doing VSL when I built us a fight house up there. So that's, so you come back from the 90 day

829
01:15:47.36 --> 01:15:52.16
stent where you're doing PSD type work and then you get put in, now this one you get and put it

830
01:15:52.16 --> 01:15:58.40
to like a DA type ODA. Yeah. Yeah. I get back and my, my, my deal was I would do two rotations on

831
01:15:58.40 --> 01:16:04.000
the first team I was on and I committed to that because there's a lot of time they spend in training

832
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.32
you know how to do certain stuff. So it was like, yeah, there's no problem. Sajima Jiu came in

833
01:16:09.04 --> 01:16:13.52
right after I got back and he's like, Hey man, I'm going to talk to your team, Sajima, but I think

834
01:16:13.52 --> 01:16:18.96
you need to be on like a, like a DA team, you know, you're like, you don't fit in and this team

835
01:16:18.96 --> 01:16:24.24
you're on now, you don't blend. You're like, you're like, you're the worst low visibility guy in the

836
01:16:24.24 --> 01:16:30.000
history of freaking special forces. Yeah man. So it didn't make sense from that lens. And I was young

837
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.88
and hungry and he wanted to like, you know, maximize on that, leverage that, get me into the fight

838
01:16:35.44 --> 01:16:39.92
for more traditional sense. So he made with my team side and seems like, cool man, this is what he

839
01:16:39.92 --> 01:16:44.000
wants. This is what's best for him. Roger that. So he let me go and then I went to a DA team.

840
01:16:44.80 --> 01:16:53.36
This is now in like early 2012 and I was with them just in time to go through a full train up

841
01:16:53.36 --> 01:17:00.80
nice of that type of work before we went in. What was my second actual combat rotation in the fall

842
01:17:00.80 --> 01:17:08.88
of 2012. And so how's that? How's that working out? It was, it was night and day man. My first pump

843
01:17:09.52 --> 01:17:16.48
doing what we were doing. We were living kush. We were living kush. Everyone had their own shoe.

844
01:17:16.48 --> 01:17:22.64
I had air conditioning and I had a full size bed. I had a plasma TV. Two different child halls,

845
01:17:22.64 --> 01:17:28.16
two different gyms, full blown fight house. Cause one of our camps was in the, was like on the

846
01:17:28.16 --> 01:17:34.40
back end of a mass of a bigger fob. So we had all the fob stuff, but then we had our own, our own

847
01:17:34.40 --> 01:17:39.44
stuff, you know, OGA camp was right next to us. They had a whole bunch of cool stuff. So I was,

848
01:17:39.44 --> 01:17:43.36
but that was not, that was just the way it was for me. It was my first trip. Like this is the way,

849
01:17:43.36 --> 01:17:47.92
this isn't living off the land. You kidding me? I haven't had to kill a single snake yet.

850
01:17:47.92 --> 01:17:54.32
You snake eaters. I got two child halls to choose from. When I switched teams and went to the DA team,

851
01:17:55.12 --> 01:18:02.48
we went in to do VSO, village stability operations. And that by design is very austere. You actually

852
01:18:02.48 --> 01:18:07.36
have limitations on what you can do to build up your physical infrastructure to keep it within

853
01:18:07.36 --> 01:18:13.52
line with what your partner force or those within that area with how they live. We assimilate to them,

854
01:18:13.52 --> 01:18:18.24
which is exactly the mission we wanted. But when you get dropped off on, you know,

855
01:18:18.24 --> 01:18:24.08
mountaintop helicopter to zero three, and you're the first team that's occupied this site,

856
01:18:24.72 --> 01:18:32.08
there's nothing. And it was like, Oh, this is what ODAs do. This is okay. This is what this,

857
01:18:32.08 --> 01:18:38.40
so it was a night and day shift from my first trip to my second. So now you're out in the middle of

858
01:18:38.40 --> 01:18:44.40
where are you Wardak? You're so you're in Wardak, just your ODA team in the middle of nowhere.

859
01:18:44.40 --> 01:18:47.84
So there were three teams that they inserted into Wardak along the Chalk Valley,

860
01:18:48.80 --> 01:18:53.60
two on one side, one on the other, but it was really just us to mutually support each other.

861
01:18:55.28 --> 01:18:59.92
And you are starting from scratch, building out what you're going to build out,

862
01:19:00.56 --> 01:19:04.56
because there's no preexisting team there at all. There's no turnover or nothing. There was a turnover

863
01:19:04.56 --> 01:19:11.04
only because the team that was on the ground when we got there, they had closed down their site,

864
01:19:11.04 --> 01:19:15.44
which is where we were originally planning on going. But as things changed operationally,

865
01:19:15.44 --> 01:19:22.72
they shut that site down. They packed up all their stuff. They moved to this secondary location.

866
01:19:23.28 --> 01:19:29.12
They were on the ground for 24 hours before we landed. So, so there's nothing. There's nothing.

867
01:19:29.12 --> 01:19:33.76
There was a team there, but they hadn't been working out of that site. Right. So then you

868
01:19:33.76 --> 01:19:38.08
guys start building out, do you have a partner force that's there? Yeah. So they handed over

869
01:19:38.08 --> 01:19:44.000
their partner force to us, which was an A&AsF team. So the regiment, the Army Special Forces had

870
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:51.12
created an Afghan National Army Special Forces unit. They looked structurally the same way as us,

871
01:19:51.12 --> 01:19:56.72
same MOS, the same breakdown. And they had 12 guys or whatever. 12 guys, just like ours. Yep.

872
01:19:56.72 --> 01:20:05.04
So you show up there, you get settled in and is the AO, how hot is the AO? It was, it was, it was

873
01:20:05.04 --> 01:20:12.56
busy. It was hot. We got our footprint, you know, we're like patrol based activities for the first,

874
01:20:12.56 --> 01:20:18.000
it's like 48 until we got some semblance of some force pro going. And then on maybe day three or

875
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.72
four, we, we went to drive down the street to Afghan local police checkpoint, which you could see

876
01:20:24.72 --> 01:20:30.32
from our camp. There's maybe 400 meters down the road. I think we had a four vehicle convoy.

877
01:20:30.32 --> 01:20:35.12
I was in the little trail vehicle working out of a hatch. And by the time a second vehicle

878
01:20:35.12 --> 01:20:41.92
got on the road, we were ambushed. So at this point, we've got like some ratty chain link fence

879
01:20:41.92 --> 01:20:47.36
and some half filled Hasco as like force pro, there's nothing, you know, other than guys that are

880
01:20:47.92 --> 01:20:53.36
up there with 240s. So ting, ting, ting, ting, and I'm like, what, I don't know what's happened.

881
01:20:53.36 --> 01:20:59.76
What kind of vehicles? We were in Matt V's man that IG 33, 31. So I'm a bomber, you know, they're

882
01:20:59.76 --> 01:21:07.20
legit. But even though I had been around a couple, you know, engagements prior, it was nothing like

883
01:21:07.20 --> 01:21:13.44
this. Like we were like ambushed. This wasn't some, you know, moron who got creative with an AK47 to

884
01:21:13.44 --> 01:21:18.08
wanted to get his G hot on for a second and then drop his gun and run away. This was like a no

885
01:21:18.08 --> 01:21:24.32
shit. We're going to fight right now. So we were not even all the way out of the gate. No,

886
01:21:25.60 --> 01:21:30.48
it's all right there. So we dropped us off into a hornets nest, you know, which we kind of knew,

887
01:21:30.48 --> 01:21:35.92
although we were prepping for location a, we ended up at location B, but they were relatively close

888
01:21:35.92 --> 01:21:40.24
where a lot of our intel and prep in terms of personalities and leadership and cells and

889
01:21:40.80 --> 01:21:45.76
who we would be targeting was still considered the same. I didn't realize it was going to be

890
01:21:45.76 --> 01:21:54.08
quite that level of, of be high. So zero white space, which became our primary mission was just

891
01:21:54.08 --> 01:21:59.92
to open that up. So every day or every other day, whenever we rolled, it was just like move to contact.

892
01:21:59.92 --> 01:22:04.000
Like that's the, that's the mission for today. That's what we're doing. Let's go find the ambush

893
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.72
and like set it off. And you're going out with your team plus the Afghan SF team. So you got like

894
01:22:10.72 --> 01:22:18.80
20, 25 guys. So we also had an infantry squad that was there as an uplift. It's about 2022.

895
01:22:19.36 --> 01:22:25.36
So I made about 15 dudes, all super young minus that the squad leader, most of them were just

896
01:22:25.36 --> 01:22:29.84
fresh out of basic young and hungry though. Hell yeah. I can work with that all day. You

897
01:22:29.84 --> 01:22:34.88
give me a blank canvas. I love me some blank canvas. So it was, it was, there were stuts

898
01:22:34.88 --> 01:22:41.44
like savages. Eventually we created some savages. Afghan national army SF team was,

899
01:22:41.44 --> 01:22:46.80
was I dedicated pattern of force. Eventually within, I say the first month or so, we started doing

900
01:22:46.80 --> 01:22:53.20
bigger ops and we bring in Afghan national army guys or another commando elements or

901
01:22:53.20 --> 01:22:59.12
Afghan national police guys. And this leads to, you know, me, me eventually getting shot up

902
01:22:59.12 --> 01:23:04.56
with an insider attack is because when you start getting all these different dudes from different

903
01:23:04.56 --> 01:23:11.12
units, there's no practical way to establish a baseline with these, with these guys. You know,

904
01:23:11.12 --> 01:23:15.12
if you're living with somebody, you get to know that way you can tell if something's off, like

905
01:23:15.12 --> 01:23:21.76
the Spidey sense can start to go off because it's different. When you're getting new bodies as

906
01:23:21.76 --> 01:23:29.36
frequent as eventually we were, it drastically opens up the risk for an insider threat. Yeah.

907
01:23:30.48 --> 01:23:35.04
You end up, you get wounded early, huh? In this deployment? Is this deployment you get wounded

908
01:23:35.04 --> 01:23:40.24
for the first time? Yeah. What happened there? Yeah. I mentioned, I ended up taking some shrapnel

909
01:23:40.24 --> 01:23:46.64
to the back of my shoulder. We were on the ground for just a few weeks. We, you know, we drove the

910
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:50.64
contact. We actually had an actual mission other than like, let's go find a fight to get into.

911
01:23:50.64 --> 01:23:57.36
We did get ambushed on the way from what ended up being what we considered to be the Taliban

912
01:23:57.36 --> 01:24:02.64
strong point village within our immediate AO. It was the first time that we actually maneuvered

913
01:24:02.64 --> 01:24:08.80
into it. And my team sergeant would tell you himself, like he made a, he made an aggressive

914
01:24:09.52 --> 01:24:15.44
decision. That's going to piss some people off to go in there. Yeah. And we were way over our

915
01:24:15.44 --> 01:24:19.20
heads and we were outgunned and outmanned, you know, because he just took myself, one of my

916
01:24:19.20 --> 01:24:24.16
teammates and then a handful of our partner force guys and we maneuver dismounted into the,

917
01:24:24.16 --> 01:24:29.52
into the village, just like the six of us. We had to swap our fire machine gun coming from the

918
01:24:29.52 --> 01:24:34.08
trucks and some mortars, but like we were in a village. Now you're in like a more urban environment

919
01:24:34.08 --> 01:24:38.32
with three US, three partner force. We've been on the ground just a few weeks,

920
01:24:39.60 --> 01:24:42.16
you know, on error. And he would tell you the same thing. Like it was a mistake.

921
01:24:42.16 --> 01:24:48.40
Like me actually getting hurt may have, may have saved that because we fought our way to

922
01:24:49.36 --> 01:24:54.48
a two story structure where we were taking Tishka fire from up to the road. So the guys are

923
01:24:54.48 --> 01:24:59.76
engaged in that way. There's some other dudes on some rooftops and there's six of us maneuvering

924
01:24:59.76 --> 01:25:04.80
through an urban environment, an Afghanistan urban environment, different than like Iraq,

925
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:09.04
but you're still dealing with buildings and multiple level structures and windows and doors and all

926
01:25:09.04 --> 01:25:16.08
the hallways and alleyways, all the things. Right. So I even noticed that one point. I'm like,

927
01:25:16.08 --> 01:25:20.80
we shouldn't be here right now. You know, we shouldn't be here right now. This is a mistake.

928
01:25:20.80 --> 01:25:25.20
I didn't voice that. I was like, Roger that, like, let's, let's keep going. And we made it to

929
01:25:26.48 --> 01:25:30.80
the structure that we were trying to breach to deal with the, with the dish. Cause I was coming

930
01:25:30.80 --> 01:25:37.84
out of the second story. And we had been receiving some, some indirect that were coming in and

931
01:25:37.84 --> 01:25:44.24
dudes were dropping grenades out of structures as well. So we're at the breach point to enter

932
01:25:44.24 --> 01:25:50.72
the courtyard into this structure that is still actively engaging and something just blows up

933
01:25:50.72 --> 01:25:55.76
behind me. And there's a grenade and it just ripped into the back of my shoulder and it was like

934
01:25:55.76 --> 01:26:01.92
getting hit with a sledgehammer. And you think about shrapnel penetrating your body. You may

935
01:26:01.92 --> 01:26:06.40
think it's like this like piercing stabbing sensation, like a piece of metal going into you,

936
01:26:06.40 --> 01:26:12.96
but it's more just impact. Someone just hit you with a bat and then I look back and there's just

937
01:26:12.96 --> 01:26:21.84
like a lemon size hole in the back of my shoulder. I'm like, Oh, okay. This just happened. So I

938
01:26:21.84 --> 01:26:28.48
immediately just like, no, I'm fine. Now adrenaline's pumping. It's a shock, but there's no real pain

939
01:26:28.48 --> 01:26:34.32
that sets in. I'm like, we're good. My team sergeant comes over and he's like, no, no, no. So he

940
01:26:34.32 --> 01:26:40.40
grabs my other teammate. He starts putting some, we get into like a little strong point. He gauzes

941
01:26:40.40 --> 01:26:45.84
it up. Is the dish still firing? Yes. That's good times. Yep. So that's still going off.

942
01:26:46.48 --> 01:26:51.60
The boys in the trucks are really the ones that are getting it. And our partner force had

943
01:26:51.60 --> 01:26:57.44
been sending a separate dismount just themselves to stop moving in towards the building as well.

944
01:26:57.44 --> 01:27:05.92
So they're treating me some gauze, calm, you know, a pressure dress and wrap it up. And my team

945
01:27:05.92 --> 01:27:11.04
sergeants like, we're, we're aborting this mission right now. We're getting back to the trucks. And

946
01:27:11.04 --> 01:27:14.88
I'm like, no, no, I'm fine. Like, let's go. We just fought our way all the way to this door that

947
01:27:14.88 --> 01:27:20.56
we're in front of now. Like, let's, let's get in there. He's like, no, no, no. This is, we're in

948
01:27:20.56 --> 01:27:26.24
overrides. So that was the, that was the trigger for him to be like, yep, let's detach and take a

949
01:27:26.24 --> 01:27:31.52
look at what I'm doing. So a lot of ways I think I'm grateful because I don't know what was on

950
01:27:31.52 --> 01:27:35.04
the other side of that door, but those guys were still getting it. And it could have been,

951
01:27:35.04 --> 01:27:42.08
it could have been a lot of different things. Yeah. You know, yeah. Sometimes the things just pile up

952
01:27:42.80 --> 01:27:47.44
where, you know, I used to joke, you know, you have the no go criteria, like, hey, this is no

953
01:27:47.44 --> 01:27:51.44
go criteria. We don't have aircraft or we don't have this, we don't have that. And I used to joke

954
01:27:51.44 --> 01:27:55.28
and say, Hey, we just have go go criteria because we're fucking going. Like that was like, you know,

955
01:27:55.28 --> 01:28:00.64
my attitude, but then this thing would happen. Something else would happen. Something else

956
01:28:00.64 --> 01:28:06.24
would happen. And it would be like, this is a sign. Like these one sign I can overlook two

957
01:28:06.24 --> 01:28:10.56
signs. Maybe I'll ignore, but now we got three, four things that are going on that don't seem right.

958
01:28:10.56 --> 01:28:14.96
It's like, Hey, we're getting out of here. This is a bad call. And it sounds like he came to that

959
01:28:14.96 --> 01:28:20.64
conclusion, which, you know, you got one wounded guy, you got it a bunkered freaking dishka

960
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:26.96
elements maneuvering through the city. Yeah. Could go sideways real quick. I mean,

961
01:28:28.40 --> 01:28:32.64
how much different does that impact? Does that shrapnel have to hit you where all of a sudden

962
01:28:32.64 --> 01:28:36.32
you're not just a wounded guy, you're a dead guy, or you're a severely wounded guy. I mean,

963
01:28:36.32 --> 01:28:42.64
two inches freaking, it's ridiculous how those little things can change the whole, the whole

964
01:28:42.64 --> 01:28:49.28
scenario. How bad were you actually hurt once you guys pulled out? It wasn't, it wasn't bad.

965
01:28:49.28 --> 01:28:54.40
You know, I get back to the trucks and we, we ITB and my medic takes a look at it and

966
01:28:55.04 --> 01:29:00.16
he's like, do your good, but it's like a pretty good hole here, man. So this was the first time

967
01:29:00.16 --> 01:29:03.92
anyone had been wounded. We'd been in the ground maybe just like a few weeks, like I said. And so

968
01:29:03.92 --> 01:29:11.60
he gets me medivac'd out and I throw a temper tantrum at the camp. I'm like, I'm not going anywhere.

969
01:29:11.60 --> 01:29:16.64
And my team side is like, yes, you are. I'm like, so I think I'm going to Germany. I think I'm

970
01:29:16.64 --> 01:29:22.24
going home like we just got here. This is where I need to be. You know, I'm really childish

971
01:29:23.20 --> 01:29:29.92
in my response to that. But I do and I get back to, they sent me to one of the, one of the

972
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:35.20
outstations where there actually was a, was a forward surgical team and they treated it.

973
01:29:35.20 --> 01:29:40.32
And the way they treat that is they pack it with this antiseptic gauze because they can't just

974
01:29:40.32 --> 01:29:45.84
sew it shut because it'll leave this open cavity. Now to get infected for infection. So they pack it

975
01:29:45.84 --> 01:29:50.64
and then you just change that dressing out, you know, three, four times a day. So it closes from

976
01:29:50.64 --> 01:29:57.12
the inside out. It was it. It really wasn't a big deal. I was supposed to stay at that location

977
01:29:57.84 --> 01:30:05.04
until it was completely healed. The head doc who was at Bagram was made aware of my wound.

978
01:30:05.04 --> 01:30:10.72
And he said, Nick will stay where you are until it's closed to make sure that there's no infection.

979
01:30:10.72 --> 01:30:19.44
How'd that work out? Yeah. After about three, four days, I started getting anxious.

980
01:30:20.88 --> 01:30:26.24
And the only rotary wing flights that were going into my site where my team was was coming out of

981
01:30:26.24 --> 01:30:30.48
Bagram. So either way, I had to get to Bagram before I could initiate movement back to

982
01:30:30.48 --> 01:30:35.84
jaw res, which is where we were. Well, I grabbed one of my buddies who's on that support team that

983
01:30:35.84 --> 01:30:41.44
was there. And I said, bring me down to the time back, which he does. And I go from one C 130 to

984
01:30:41.44 --> 01:30:46.96
another one until I find one that's going to Bagram. And I go up to the time, like, Hey,

985
01:30:46.96 --> 01:30:50.64
you guys go to Bagram. It was like the third plane I walked on. And they'll like, Yeah, we're taking

986
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:53.68
off in like 10 minutes. And I can wait through. They're like, Sure. So I just jump in the plane.

987
01:30:53.68 --> 01:30:59.28
I don't tell anybody where I'm going, land at Bagram. I had been to Bagram before. That's where

988
01:30:59.28 --> 01:31:04.24
we originally landed when we got there. But I was only on Bagram for like a day until we just got

989
01:31:04.24 --> 01:31:09.68
all about stuff together. And then we flew out to our site. So I wasn't familiar with Bagram at all,

990
01:31:09.68 --> 01:31:14.96
which back then it was like a city. I mean, Bagram is huge. So I land, I have no idea really where

991
01:31:14.96 --> 01:31:21.12
I am. I know that the special ops camp is in the vicinity of this. So I find my way over there.

992
01:31:21.76 --> 01:31:27.52
And I walk into the jock. And it was my first time actually being in like a real jock. I hadn't

993
01:31:27.52 --> 01:31:31.76
seen one before with all the TVs and all the different staff sections. And they're all wired

994
01:31:31.76 --> 01:31:39.68
in. It was like, This is kind of cool. I haven't seen it before. And I walk in and the sodif commander,

995
01:31:39.68 --> 01:31:43.52
who's my battalion level command team, they're the ones that are running the sodif,

996
01:31:43.52 --> 01:31:50.16
special operations task force. He's like, Hey, what are you, what are you doing here? And I'm

997
01:31:50.16 --> 01:31:56.48
like, Hey, sir, hey, doing, you know, I need to ride back to, to JARES. This dude's from Boston.

998
01:31:56.48 --> 01:32:04.08
So he starts going off. He had actually brought in a bleach a seat chair that he bought that used

999
01:32:04.08 --> 01:32:11.12
to be in Fenway Park as his like battle chair. Hell yeah. So they refurbished Fenway Park and

1000
01:32:11.12 --> 01:32:15.84
they sold a bunch of stuff. So he brings this over with him to Afghanistan. So rather than focus on

1001
01:32:15.84 --> 01:32:19.84
why I am there, he just wants to show me his chair. He's like, Dude, look at the chair I brought

1002
01:32:19.84 --> 01:32:24.16
it has this great. This was used to be out in Fenway Park, whatever. And I'm kind of like, Yeah,

1003
01:32:24.16 --> 01:32:28.72
that's it. That's awesome. That's an awesome ship. Well, then the, then the sodif commander,

1004
01:32:28.72 --> 01:32:31.92
Sergeant Major walks over and he's like, No, really, what are you doing here?

1005
01:32:33.12 --> 01:32:38.16
I like how you can always know the officers, but the freaking E dogs, man, they're on to your

1006
01:32:38.16 --> 01:32:45.28
bullshit. There was no any Jedi thing happening with him. He's like, Why are you here? And I'm,

1007
01:32:45.28 --> 01:32:50.32
I'm like, coming up with some bullshit that doesn't float. And then the phone rings. And

1008
01:32:50.32 --> 01:32:56.32
he picks it up and I hear the yelling on the other end of the phone. And it's my company,

1009
01:32:56.32 --> 01:33:01.76
Sergeant Major, who is at the location that I had just left from. I've been gone maybe three hours

1010
01:33:01.76 --> 01:33:07.60
or something for hours. And I hear him screaming and CSM is like, Oh no, he's right here in front of

1011
01:33:07.60 --> 01:33:13.04
me. And I'm like, Okay, now I know this is about me. I don't am I going to get court-martialed?

1012
01:33:13.04 --> 01:33:19.36
Like what happens? I don't know. I know I'm in trouble. So he hands me the phone and my company,

1013
01:33:19.36 --> 01:33:24.80
Sergeant Major, just loses his mind on me, you know, for like 10 minutes. And I'm just like,

1014
01:33:24.80 --> 01:33:29.04
Roger that, Roger that, a lot of that going on. And at the end, he's like, Okay, dude, listen,

1015
01:33:29.04 --> 01:33:33.44
like, I get it. I get it. I've been there before I get it. But like, don't ever do that again.

1016
01:33:34.08 --> 01:33:41.04
I said, Roger that hang up. Well, now everyone's kind of joking about it a little bit. CSM thinks

1017
01:33:41.04 --> 01:33:44.48
it's kind of cool, but he's also trying to be professional. There's a lot of people around.

1018
01:33:44.48 --> 01:33:50.80
I've clearly just done something and subordinate. It was it was a the commander eventually gets

1019
01:33:50.80 --> 01:33:57.28
switched on. He's like, Oh, wait, what? Did you really just do that? Well, my team's on a mission,

1020
01:33:57.28 --> 01:34:02.72
right at that point. My first time in a jock, I just got yelled at, which is fine. We're kind of

1021
01:34:02.72 --> 01:34:09.04
joking. And I look up red lights that's going off, you know, essential personnel only inside the

1022
01:34:09.04 --> 01:34:12.16
jock, people are leaving, people are coming in, people are getting spun up, I can tell something's

1023
01:34:12.16 --> 01:34:18.32
going on. And it's my team on and off and my team sergeant takes around to the abdomen. And I'm

1024
01:34:18.32 --> 01:34:23.36
watching this for the first time through the lens of an ISR feed, I've never seen it before.

1025
01:34:24.24 --> 01:34:28.40
And it takes a minute to realize what's happening. And I put two and two together, and I have, you

1026
01:34:28.40 --> 01:34:36.32
know, an emotional breakdown of rage. And I'm like throwing chairs, immature, completely emotionally

1027
01:34:36.32 --> 01:34:44.32
charged response or reaction. And I'm like, you guys need to get me a ride now. I'm going back.

1028
01:34:45.04 --> 01:34:54.96
And I get pulled out of the jock, and the dock shows up. And I'm with the group or the SOTIF

1029
01:34:54.96 --> 01:35:02.80
commander, and the SOTIF CSM and the doc comes over. And he's like, Why are you here? You need to

1030
01:35:02.80 --> 01:35:08.40
wait till you're healed. You're not going back. And I started yelling at him. And then the command is

1031
01:35:08.40 --> 01:35:15.12
like, Listen, doc, I don't think you want to tell this dude, like, no, like he's, he just like,

1032
01:35:15.76 --> 01:35:19.60
jumped on a plane and flew here. Like he's like, he's gonna he's going back. So they

1033
01:35:19.60 --> 01:35:25.36
overrode that decision. And I was back on a bird the next day or the day after that, back out with

1034
01:35:25.36 --> 01:35:29.44
the team. And what happened to your wound, the guy that got wounded? Would you say that was your

1035
01:35:29.44 --> 01:35:33.84
team surgeon? Yep. So he came in, I was there to meet him at the hospital when he showed up to

1036
01:35:33.84 --> 01:35:39.44
Bagram, which was good. He went into surgery. He was medivac out of country. He was over in Germany.

1037
01:35:39.44 --> 01:35:46.000
I don't think he ended up going back to the States, because he returned back in to the team. He was

1038
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:53.44
out of the game for maybe a month or two. And then he came back over. Do you guys have any kind of

1039
01:35:53.44 --> 01:35:59.76
backfill plan? I mean, you only got 12 dudes. When someone gets hit, that's like a freaking significant

1040
01:35:59.76 --> 01:36:08.56
amount of the force. Yeah, every dude does play a big role. We didn't get outfitted with the with

1041
01:36:08.56 --> 01:36:16.40
the new team sergeant, just the next senior guy on the team picked it up. Yep. Oftentimes, we will

1042
01:36:16.40 --> 01:36:21.60
get augmented by by one of the support teams that's in the area. Yeah, because I mean, you got 12

1043
01:36:21.60 --> 01:36:29.44
guys, like that's that's a freaking important gun, just like legit, like just a gunner. Even vehicles,

1044
01:36:29.44 --> 01:36:34.24
like whatever you're doing, that's freaking crazy to think about that. You lose two or three guys,

1045
01:36:34.24 --> 01:36:41.68
like you're almost you need replacements sometimes. Oh, yeah. So you get back up there now. How often

1046
01:36:41.68 --> 01:36:45.76
do you what's your op tempo like? Like how often are you guys going out? Yeah, we're going out

1047
01:36:45.76 --> 01:36:52.08
probably three, four times a week. And and most of the time, do you have things that you're doing

1048
01:36:52.08 --> 01:36:55.84
trying to do civil affairs out there? Or are you going out patrol to contact? Like what are you

1049
01:36:55.84 --> 01:37:03.92
guys actually trying to do? Yeah, so our mission was to open up white space, open up freedom of

1050
01:37:03.92 --> 01:37:11.44
maneuver so that some of the other units in the entire AO had the ability to begin their X fill

1051
01:37:11.44 --> 01:37:18.56
process. So this is 2012 going into 2013. The writings on the wall that we're about to close

1052
01:37:18.56 --> 01:37:24.32
down Afghanistan. So the units on the ground are making those preparations to be able to get men

1053
01:37:24.32 --> 01:37:30.80
with weapons and equipment to Bagram and to Canada. So we needed to open up some lanes. So does

1054
01:37:30.80 --> 01:37:35.60
that mean you're are you setting up combat outposts out there? Or are you just going out clearing and

1055
01:37:35.60 --> 01:37:41.60
then leaving? What are you doing? No, so the Afghan local police concept was built specifically for

1056
01:37:41.60 --> 01:37:51.20
this where we would build and or reinforce checkpoints along the major avenues throughout the AO.

1057
01:37:51.20 --> 01:37:57.04
So there were these Afghan local police checkpoints that were all down the major roads. So we were

1058
01:37:57.04 --> 01:38:02.64
rather building those out, validating the ones that were already there, training the guys that were

1059
01:38:02.64 --> 01:38:08.000
there or bringing in like resources and stuff to make them more effective. So let's say you might,

1060
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
oh, we got this checkpoint down there, checkpoint four, we're going to go out there today, we're

1061
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.44
going to check their force structure, we're going to meet with their people, we're going to give

1062
01:38:15.44 --> 01:38:19.76
us some pistol training, and then we're going to come back. That's kind of like the type of stuff

1063
01:38:19.76 --> 01:38:25.12
that you were doing. Yeah, that and then we were tied also into the local and regional government

1064
01:38:25.12 --> 01:38:31.20
officials to help them with their structure and they're building out and just gaining more control

1065
01:38:31.20 --> 01:38:37.44
of the area from like a civil and diplomatic perspective, which it's a tough task to do that

1066
01:38:37.44 --> 01:38:45.04
in Afghanistan. So we mostly focused on Afghan local police enhancement via checkpoints along

1067
01:38:45.04 --> 01:38:48.32
the major routes. What's the local populace populace think of you?

1068
01:38:51.20 --> 01:38:57.44
Hit or miss. In an area like that, you're really putting the local populace in a lose lose scenario.

1069
01:38:57.44 --> 01:39:02.24
We come in big, big white guys, big American guys,

1070
01:39:02.80 --> 01:39:06.64
tatted up with all the guns and this stuff. And we come in and be like, you're going to help us.

1071
01:39:07.36 --> 01:39:12.64
And what are they going to say? No. The problem is when they say yes, the actual dudes that run

1072
01:39:12.64 --> 01:39:18.48
the show in that whole area, they're going to come back. So, you know, it's tough. And they know

1073
01:39:18.48 --> 01:39:22.80
those Americans, they know that they're going to leave someday. The local populace like, oh,

1074
01:39:22.80 --> 01:39:29.44
you're here now, but the Taliban is going to be here forever. Yeah. So it's an impossible.

1075
01:39:29.44 --> 01:39:32.80
Is the biggest threat on the ground IEDs at this point?

1076
01:39:34.64 --> 01:39:40.32
At this point, the biggest threat on the ground was IEDs and then a close second would be the

1077
01:39:40.32 --> 01:39:48.000
insider attack, which once that happened to us in what it would have been early 2013 on the same

1078
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.48
deployment. That was kind of the catalyst that drove that threat up to supersede IEDs within

1079
01:39:54.48 --> 01:40:00.08
that immediate area because it was just so effective. You ended up getting shot again, right?

1080
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:05.92
Or you get shot? Yeah. In the what? In the face? In the face. Yep. I took an AK round,

1081
01:40:06.56 --> 01:40:10.96
which sounds worse than it was. It really just grazed my cheek and, you know,

1082
01:40:10.96 --> 01:40:17.04
ripped a chunk open. It did clip an ottery, so it bled a bit, but I didn't know that I had been

1083
01:40:17.04 --> 01:40:25.36
shot for like an hour or two after the fact because it was the result of a massive IED that

1084
01:40:25.36 --> 01:40:32.000
hit ILEAD vehicle, decimated the truck. And when I showed up to that vehicle, there were some

1085
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.44
dismounts that had showed up as well. This was a full on ambush. So we'll talk us through it. So

1086
01:40:37.44 --> 01:40:42.08
you're out on patrol. How many vehicles got with you? So we had, I think it was four trucks and

1087
01:40:42.08 --> 01:40:48.80
a couple side by side raises on that. We were returning to base from the thing. We just did

1088
01:40:48.80 --> 01:40:53.84
like a KLE, a key leader engagement. How far away are you from like, what are these? Are these like

1089
01:40:53.84 --> 01:40:57.92
four mile, five mile transits? Are they shorter than that? This one was a little longer. This one

1090
01:40:57.92 --> 01:41:04.32
we drove out along the main road, maybe nine miles, 10 miles. And we were on the way back

1091
01:41:04.32 --> 01:41:13.04
when we hit this. And we had driven down this road multiple times before. And this thing had been

1092
01:41:13.04 --> 01:41:20.64
in place before all that. They just, they never set it off. LEAD vehicle, which has my team leader

1093
01:41:20.64 --> 01:41:25.44
in it, he, that vehicle gets just decimated. What vehicle are you in? I'm in vehicle four,

1094
01:41:25.44 --> 01:41:31.12
working out of a hatch. And I see it go off in front of me. And we had hit a bunch of smaller

1095
01:41:31.12 --> 01:41:38.16
IEDs before. So I was familiar with it. But this thing was the biggest and the most accurately

1096
01:41:38.16 --> 01:41:44.56
timed. It just, it was perfect. Picks up the truck and just launches it off the side of the road

1097
01:41:44.56 --> 01:41:48.96
down into this apple apple orchard off to the side. And it was down this little ravine

1098
01:41:50.40 --> 01:41:54.72
off the side of the road. And that was the initiation of a complex ambush. So PKM,

1099
01:41:54.72 --> 01:42:04.72
IPG, some indirect are all coming in. And, you know, I know what react to ideas. We have that

1100
01:42:04.72 --> 01:42:12.88
SOP established. And I don't do my job. This is important note. Instead, I jump out of this hatch,

1101
01:42:12.88 --> 01:42:18.72
the vehicle's still moving. And I take off on foot towards the truck, which was, you know,

1102
01:42:18.72 --> 01:42:25.20
a couple hundred meters away from me, not a tactical movement by me, like rifle in hand.

1103
01:42:25.20 --> 01:42:30.56
And I'm just at a dead sprint to the vehicle. And I slide down off the side of the road into

1104
01:42:30.56 --> 01:42:37.60
this, into this orchard. And I know, solo, this is a solo. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just going by myself.

1105
01:42:38.32 --> 01:42:43.76
I know everyone's dead. There's no way anyone survived that level of destruction. The truck is

1106
01:42:43.76 --> 01:42:49.36
on its side. So drive the side door is pinned against the ground. Passengers side door would be

1107
01:42:49.36 --> 01:42:55.60
facing the sky. And I, I slid off the road and I tripped and fall. And what I had tripped over

1108
01:42:55.60 --> 01:43:03.60
was my teammate who was in the turret of that truck, who was ejected and landed about 30 meters

1109
01:43:03.60 --> 01:43:08.24
from the vehicle. I didn't see him. I tripped over him, looked back and it's him. And he's alive.

1110
01:43:08.24 --> 01:43:14.64
And I can't believe it. His leg snapped in half just below his knee. He's got a whole bunch of other

1111
01:43:14.64 --> 01:43:21.04
like lacerations on his face, but he's alive. He's suffering from immediate blast injury for

1112
01:43:21.04 --> 01:43:25.60
sure. He's incoherent, but he's alive. He's breathing. He's not bleeding from anywhere profusely. So

1113
01:43:26.48 --> 01:43:32.56
I do like a quick assessment of him. And then I start hearing different rounds impacting the

1114
01:43:32.56 --> 01:43:38.08
truck, which is behind me about 30 meters and some dismounts that showed up. And they were just kind

1115
01:43:38.08 --> 01:43:43.68
of randomly shooting at the vehicle. They're shooting at the blown up vehicle? Yeah. So just

1116
01:43:43.68 --> 01:43:51.44
ting, ting, ting. I turn around. There's three of them. So I smoked two. The third one takes off,

1117
01:43:51.44 --> 01:43:56.40
run it. And this isn't again an apple orchard, but it's in October or it's November. So there's not

1118
01:43:56.40 --> 01:44:00.32
a lot of vegetation. There's just mostly trees and branches. So you can, I can see kind of, but

1119
01:44:00.32 --> 01:44:07.12
there's just a lot of, so I'm maneuvering through this. He's running away from me on an angle with

1120
01:44:07.12 --> 01:44:15.12
his AK over his shoulder firing been my general direction while running away. And next thing you

1121
01:44:15.12 --> 01:44:20.80
know, I'm looking up at the sky. Boom. I felt an impact. I'm looking up at the sky. And I thought that

1122
01:44:20.80 --> 01:44:29.68
I had run into a branch from a tree and it just knocked me over. So I pop up and I like kind of

1123
01:44:29.68 --> 01:44:37.36
look around and I'm fine. And I go to reengage on this dude and I noticed the vehicle is on fire.

1124
01:44:37.36 --> 01:44:40.56
And I hadn't checked the vehicle. I had the only, I've only seen one of my buddies.

1125
01:44:41.44 --> 01:44:45.28
So as bad as I really want to go kill this dude, I was like, I'm going to go check the vehicle

1126
01:44:45.28 --> 01:44:51.04
instead. So fortunately, the passenger door, which against facing the sky had been blown off the

1127
01:44:51.04 --> 01:44:56.08
hinges because the truck had basically collapsed on itself. So the turret was, you couldn't,

1128
01:44:56.08 --> 01:45:02.64
there was no access point inside the cab other than that door. Climb up the vehicle,

1129
01:45:05.44 --> 01:45:12.64
look in and my team leader is buried kind of where the driver seat would be. And he's trying to

1130
01:45:12.64 --> 01:45:20.88
establish comms, which just says a lot about like training and like just doing what you'd need to do

1131
01:45:20.88 --> 01:45:27.12
regardless of how bad it gets. I mean, he's in a exploded vehicle and he's a mess. Both his legs

1132
01:45:27.12 --> 01:45:30.88
are are nasty. He's a below the knee amputee. Now both his legs are completely mangled.

1133
01:45:31.44 --> 01:45:36.72
He's got an arterial bleed through his arm. His face is completely riddled with spall.

1134
01:45:37.44 --> 01:45:42.96
And he's on the radio in a destroy decimated truck trying to establish comms, communicate to

1135
01:45:42.96 --> 01:45:47.76
high Elb, what's going on? Says a lot about that dude. I'm looking inside this vehicle,

1136
01:45:47.76 --> 01:45:53.36
you know, we're still taking PKM and RPG. Now our trucks are set up, they're returning fire.

1137
01:45:53.36 --> 01:45:56.08
We got a couple of us 60 millimeter mortars out, they're returning fire.

1138
01:45:56.88 --> 01:46:02.40
Team Sergeant, who are acting team Sergeant at the time, he's got a maneuver element that's

1139
01:46:02.40 --> 01:46:06.80
maneuvering on the ambush line. I don't think anyone really knew what where I even was.

1140
01:46:07.52 --> 01:46:13.44
Because I'm in the middle of all this that's happening. I look inside the truck, I see him.

1141
01:46:13.44 --> 01:46:20.64
Okay, trucks on fire, it's burning from the back towards the cab. I look inside the rounds from

1142
01:46:20.64 --> 01:46:25.68
inside the vehicle are starting to pop off from the heat. So it's like looking into a

1143
01:46:25.68 --> 01:46:30.56
like a popcorn bag, pop pop pop pop pop pop. Rounds are still taking off the front of the truck

1144
01:46:30.56 --> 01:46:36.88
from the enemy machine gun fire. I'm like, this is a really bad day here. And that this is where it

1145
01:46:36.88 --> 01:46:43.12
ends. There's no way either one of us are making out of this. My team leader played offensive

1146
01:46:43.12 --> 01:46:50.32
line at West Point. Big Cat. This is the dude that's legs are mangled, trying to make comms on

1147
01:46:50.32 --> 01:46:57.12
the radio. Yeah, our captain. So he's a big Jack dude. Big boy. I wouldn't say jacked, but just a

1148
01:46:57.12 --> 01:47:05.12
horse, six, seven, about, about two 90 to 25 without without kit. Big boy with kit, he's well over

1149
01:47:05.12 --> 01:47:11.36
300 pounds. And we used to joke about this, you know, which is kind of ironic that he and I can

1150
01:47:11.36 --> 01:47:17.20
never be in the same vehicle because we were the only ones big enough to move the other guy

1151
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:25.28
if we needed to, which is what played out. So I see him in there, big dude wedged in a pile of

1152
01:47:25.28 --> 01:47:29.28
metal that's on fire rounds outside the vehicle rounds inside the vehicle. Anyone else inside

1153
01:47:29.28 --> 01:47:40.40
the vehicle? No. How is that? So it seemed like two got ejected or three got ejected. There were

1154
01:47:40.40 --> 01:47:48.08
two in the back, the guy in the turret, and then the driver managed to scathing scamper out of that

1155
01:47:48.08 --> 01:47:54.48
of that doorway before I got there. Were they Afghans or Americans? Was it all Americans?

1156
01:47:55.92 --> 01:48:00.16
All Americans except for one of my turps, one of my interpreters was in that truck.

1157
01:48:00.72 --> 01:48:05.84
God, I can't believe these guys made it out of there. Yeah, it's freaking crazy. It is. It is crazy.

1158
01:48:05.84 --> 01:48:11.84
Because they all lived, but I assumed that everyone would be dead based on the level of damage.

1159
01:48:12.64 --> 01:48:20.24
So I jump in the truck and I kind of just wedge him up a little bit out of the area where he was,

1160
01:48:20.24 --> 01:48:26.000
kind of pressed him into the dash. And then I climbed myself back out and then just grabbed his

1161
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.36
kit and just like dead lifted him out of this thing and just chucked him over the side of the

1162
01:48:31.36 --> 01:48:35.12
truck. And at this point, some of our partner force guys had showed up, a couple of my teammates

1163
01:48:35.12 --> 01:48:42.24
had showed up. So they took him, busted out of Lita, began moving him. The truck pretty much burnt

1164
01:48:42.24 --> 01:48:50.08
up completely within a minute or so after we were both out. And then we just circled around to find,

1165
01:48:50.08 --> 01:48:55.68
scoop up all the rest of the guys that were just in random areas around, set up a CCP and then

1166
01:48:56.80 --> 01:49:00.40
finished the fight and then went to our med course action.

1167
01:49:00.40 --> 01:49:07.60
How far back was it to get back to base? We were maybe three, four miles out.

1168
01:49:07.60 --> 01:49:14.000
So did you go back before you cast the guys? No, we set up an HLZ right there. Bird came in,

1169
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.20
we pushed out the dudes, they did launch a ground QRF element from one of the sister teams that was

1170
01:49:19.20 --> 01:49:24.96
in the valley with us. They showed up on the ground. We met a back to five or six guys that were in

1171
01:49:24.96 --> 01:49:33.44
that truck right from there. And then eventually I got medivac'd out after.

1172
01:49:33.44 --> 01:49:38.56
Did you guys blow that freaking truck in place or did it burn so much that you didn't even have to do anything?

1173
01:49:38.56 --> 01:49:44.72
I tried, they strapped a couple charges to it. But it was pretty much destroyed. Anyway,

1174
01:49:44.72 --> 01:49:51.20
they recovered some of the combo stuff and then bit like the rest. But I was treating one of the

1175
01:49:51.20 --> 01:49:56.80
guys in the vehicle once we established the CCP, his one of our attachments, one of our

1176
01:49:56.80 --> 01:50:02.64
nerdy attachments, although important, his eye had come out of his head. So his eye was like

1177
01:50:02.64 --> 01:50:07.60
dangling down where his cheek is. So I was treating him, put the eye back in the socket and I'm wrapping

1178
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:13.28
it up with gauze. And one of my teammates comes over and just slaps some gauze against the side

1179
01:50:13.28 --> 01:50:18.80
of my face. And this is like 90 minutes after initial contact. And I'm looking up at him like,

1180
01:50:18.80 --> 01:50:22.96
and I'm looking up at him like, what are you doing? And he's like, bro, you're like gushing blood.

1181
01:50:23.60 --> 01:50:28.16
I'm like, really? I'm like, all right, so he's holding the thing against my face. I'm putting

1182
01:50:28.16 --> 01:50:34.64
this guy's eye back in his head. And then I, you know, stand up, I take a look at it. I didn't take

1183
01:50:34.64 --> 01:50:40.48
a look at it. I'm like talking to him. I'm talking to him. And my medic was like, yeah, I think we're

1184
01:50:40.48 --> 01:50:46.96
going to need to get you out of here to get that looked at. And, you know, I throw another childish

1185
01:50:46.96 --> 01:50:52.16
type of tantrum right there. I refused to leave until the other guys were out and then the QRF

1186
01:50:52.16 --> 01:50:56.56
showed up. So they showed up situation under control. They were going to escort them back to base.

1187
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.20
There was one bird that had come back in. So I jumped on that. And then I was made it back to out.

1188
01:51:05.44 --> 01:51:09.36
And then how was it? Was the result of that? I mean, would they do stitch it up?

1189
01:51:09.92 --> 01:51:15.52
No, they had to cauterize it. I guess because it clipped an artery. So they sent me to Bagram,

1190
01:51:15.52 --> 01:51:22.08
which is where the rest of the guys were at. And I wanted to just be with those dudes. I wasn't

1191
01:51:22.08 --> 01:51:26.000
sure if some of them were going to live. I mean, some of them were like real banged up. So I wanted

1192
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.80
to get there and be with them. And I had a little bit of a situation with some of the army staff

1193
01:51:30.80 --> 01:51:35.36
that were at the hospital. They have this protocol where they don't allow a kit, grenades, weapons,

1194
01:51:35.36 --> 01:51:39.76
like they secure all that stuff into like a separate area. I had never been in a hospital

1195
01:51:39.76 --> 01:51:46.24
like this before. And I just come blasting in the front door, angry, looking for my teammates. And,

1196
01:51:46.24 --> 01:51:53.44
you know, two or three of these little like E3 med kids were like, stop physically like getting

1197
01:51:53.44 --> 01:52:00.56
in my way to try to take my weapons and kit from me. And I did not appreciate that at all.

1198
01:52:00.56 --> 01:52:06.08
Fortunately, one of them, another SF guy that was there came over and grabbed me and pulled me

1199
01:52:06.08 --> 01:52:14.16
in real tight and was like, you need to calm down, man. So I gave him my stuff. And there happened

1200
01:52:14.16 --> 01:52:24.64
to be a army reservist doctor was in Bagram, who in his day to day job owns a plastic surgery clinic.

1201
01:52:24.64 --> 01:52:29.20
So he's an army doctor. And then he's a plastic surgeon civilian life. He was the guy that treated

1202
01:52:29.20 --> 01:52:34.000
me. So he pulls me over and he's like, Hey, man, I gotta, I'm going to cauterize your wound. And

1203
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.44
then I'm going to, I'm going to sew it back up. I'm going to get you on some pain management stuff

1204
01:52:40.24 --> 01:52:47.28
like now, like, interveneously. And I'm like, no, you're not doing that. And he's like, no,

1205
01:52:47.28 --> 01:52:52.000
it's like gonna, it's gonna be unpleasant. I'm like, do listen doc, like hit me with some

1206
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.20
lidocaine if you want, that's fine. Some like numb it up. But you're not going to put me out of my

1207
01:52:57.20 --> 01:53:04.72
mind. I'm not going to be stoned and drifting around this place in pixie land. Two of my teammates

1208
01:53:04.72 --> 01:53:09.68
are in surgery. Three other ones are bedside right there. You need to hurry up and do whatever this

1209
01:53:09.68 --> 01:53:16.32
is so I can go do my job, which is to be next to those guys right now. So the sort of commander

1210
01:53:16.32 --> 01:53:20.08
had showed up because there's six or now I think seven of us wounded, he shows up and

1211
01:53:20.08 --> 01:53:28.24
the doctor looks over at him and sort of commanders like just, just go ahead and do it. So I'm laying

1212
01:53:28.24 --> 01:53:33.84
down on my side and he, this little medical welder that goes in and, you know, like burns it back

1213
01:53:33.84 --> 01:53:39.52
together and then so is it shut and, you know, it's stuck. But I was so angry and filled with

1214
01:53:39.52 --> 01:53:45.52
just rage and concern that it really wasn't that big of a deal. And then you said all the guys that

1215
01:53:45.52 --> 01:53:52.88
got wounded, they lived. Yeah. Yeah. And yet how many of them got Kazovac out of country?

1216
01:53:53.52 --> 01:53:57.20
All of them. So now how many guys you got left on your freaking team?

1217
01:53:57.92 --> 01:54:05.92
So out of the out of the six, only two were SF guys. Okay. Our captain and our,

1218
01:54:05.92 --> 01:54:09.60
another one of our weapons guys, another one of another Bravo, the guy was an a turret.

1219
01:54:09.60 --> 01:54:18.72
So they replaced my captain. They gave us a new captain who was already in country. He was working

1220
01:54:18.72 --> 01:54:23.28
out as like a staff support officer in one of the other locations. They pushed him to us.

1221
01:54:24.56 --> 01:54:31.12
And then it's back to business. Yeah. You get back up and it's like,

1222
01:54:31.12 --> 01:54:39.52
uh, you got to adjust to this new captain. You got to work through the guys that you did lose,

1223
01:54:39.52 --> 01:54:44.000
the other guys that that left, even though they weren't, they weren't attached to your ODA, but

1224
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.68
you got to replace them somehow. So you can start figuring the stuff out how, how long it

1225
01:54:47.68 --> 01:54:51.12
would take for you guys were going back out on ops. Yeah, there was definitely a lag.

1226
01:54:52.96 --> 01:54:59.68
That was the end of November. So right around early December was when the snow came in anyway.

1227
01:54:59.68 --> 01:55:05.44
And when you're at 75, 7,800 feet in the mountains, I mean, that's like real snow,

1228
01:55:05.44 --> 01:55:13.28
like feet of snow. So the timing was kind of good for us because no one can move when you've got

1229
01:55:13.28 --> 01:55:17.52
nine feet of snow outside in the mountains. So everything just kind of goes on pause for a little

1230
01:55:17.52 --> 01:55:22.08
bit from like December through like the end of January. That's where we got a new captain.

1231
01:55:22.64 --> 01:55:27.28
We got plused up with a couple more attachments to backfill the dudes that we had lost.

1232
01:55:27.28 --> 01:55:32.72
So we had, you know, eight, nine weeks together just to kind of get our stuff together, bring the

1233
01:55:32.72 --> 01:55:37.60
new captain of the speed. So by the time we were ready to kind of get back into it, come early

1234
01:55:37.60 --> 01:55:43.84
February timeframe, he was, he was good to go. And then you start doing ops again. Yeah.

1235
01:55:45.60 --> 01:55:50.000
And now you're working like you were talking about earlier, you're starting to do some bigger ops,

1236
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.08
and you've got a bunch of other Afghans coming in from different areas, different units,

1237
01:55:56.08 --> 01:56:01.52
and that could be sketchy. And you guys know it's sketchy.

1238
01:56:01.52 --> 01:56:12.64
Yeah. We, we prefer to keep our, our, our task org with our internal unit, because we lived with

1239
01:56:12.64 --> 01:56:19.44
this A&AsF team. And we're talking about like a broken down clay, you know, structures. Like

1240
01:56:19.44 --> 01:56:24.08
when I say we were living together, I mean, we were living together. Right. So you, you, you gain

1241
01:56:24.08 --> 01:56:28.80
that bond with those, with those guys, and you learn them, you learn their personalities, their

1242
01:56:28.80 --> 01:56:34.80
character, their, their quirks. When you start throwing, you know, hundred random dudes at us,

1243
01:56:34.80 --> 01:56:39.92
because we're going to go do some massive village clients. You don't know any of these guys. We

1244
01:56:39.92 --> 01:56:45.84
have been training them like randomly within our training cycle, where we would run through,

1245
01:56:45.84 --> 01:56:49.28
you know, a couple of days with the Afghan national army, a couple of days with the Afghan

1246
01:56:49.28 --> 01:56:54.000
national police, couple of days with the ALP, the local police guys, our own guys. So there was a

1247
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.60
there was a system in place, but they're still just sending us whoever they wanted to go to train

1248
01:56:59.60 --> 01:57:05.20
in that day. And you know, you said, you mentioned earlier that the threat, IED threat started to

1249
01:57:05.84 --> 01:57:14.000
be surpassed by the threat of an insider attack. So was there insider attacks before you guys had

1250
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.60
yours? Yeah. And so you guys are full, full aware like this shit can happen. Yeah, we were,

1251
01:57:19.60 --> 01:57:31.12
we didn't take it as seriously as we should have. We didn't prioritize it enough to instill greater

1252
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:38.32
mitigation criteria. We had some stuff in place, but we got, we were sloppy, I think as a detachment.

1253
01:57:38.96 --> 01:57:45.20
It's not anything you can prevent by any means, but we could have done a better job to mitigate it,

1254
01:57:45.20 --> 01:57:48.72
you know, and a lot of the lessons that have gone out from the event with us,

1255
01:57:48.72 --> 01:57:55.68
which is still considered the most catastrophic insider attack since 9 11 is the lessons learned

1256
01:57:55.68 --> 01:58:00.48
from that are being employed now really much as like, as like pretty much a baseline for all the

1257
01:58:00.48 --> 01:58:08.96
guys that work with with indige. All right. So, so let's get there. It's March 11th, 2013. And you

1258
01:58:08.96 --> 01:58:13.92
guys are getting ready for some kind of a big operation. What are you doing to clearance? We,

1259
01:58:13.92 --> 01:58:21.28
what were you planning to do? Yeah, we were doing a larger village clearance. I believe

1260
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:29.60
my memory is terrible during this whole timeframe because of me getting banged up that day. But I

1261
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:39.04
believe we were going to do like a 48 hour clearance with Iran and we were sit tight. I think it was

1262
01:58:39.04 --> 01:58:45.76
more of an ALP checkpoint establishment mission to begin building something from nothing.

1263
01:58:46.40 --> 01:58:51.92
And so this is one of those ops where you have a bunch of other Afghans that you don't know. Maybe

1264
01:58:51.92 --> 01:58:57.84
you've seen them sporadically, but I mean, look, you get freaking a group of a hundred Afghans

1265
01:58:57.84 --> 01:59:03.44
that you saw three months ago, you know, like who knows who these guys are. They might as well

1266
01:59:03.44 --> 01:59:11.36
just been right. Random. So you guys had some, some standard operating procedures as far as

1267
01:59:12.16 --> 01:59:15.76
what you would, how you conduct these operations because you knew it, you know, it is a threat.

1268
01:59:15.76 --> 01:59:21.76
You know that an insider attack is there's some level of threat to it. So you have some standard

1269
01:59:21.76 --> 01:59:28.16
operating procedures about how you're treating the Afghans. Correct. And keeping them some keeping

1270
01:59:28.16 --> 01:59:33.60
some kind of distance. And so what is basically like you would only allow the leadership into the

1271
01:59:33.60 --> 01:59:37.76
compound. That was kind of the standard operating procedure. Yeah. So our compound had two layers

1272
01:59:37.76 --> 01:59:43.44
to it internal, which is where we lived and where our ops center was. And then we had outside that

1273
01:59:43.44 --> 01:59:48.88
perimeter was where our motor pool was. So we kept our vehicles, fuel weapons, or not weapons, but

1274
01:59:48.88 --> 01:59:59.20
other storage. So our SOP was for an op, the units would show up, they would stay outside of our

1275
01:59:59.20 --> 02:00:06.48
entire perimeter. The leadership would come into our motor pool area. So we could brief them on

1276
02:00:06.48 --> 02:00:12.96
what we were doing. Standard practice is you want to keep that window where you notify your

1277
02:00:12.96 --> 02:00:18.80
partner force where you're going as narrow as you can, because they talk. So in an attempt to reduce

1278
02:00:18.80 --> 02:00:23.92
that word getting out, we would just tell them right there and then and then we would roll.

1279
02:00:25.44 --> 02:00:32.40
And that worked for us, you know, and the Bravo section 18 Bravo section is responsible for base

1280
02:00:32.40 --> 02:00:38.08
defense. Right. So meet my team and I or my my section and I we the ones that put this together

1281
02:00:38.08 --> 02:00:45.12
team size and obviously is the one that says yes, because we roll with and it worked that entire

1282
02:00:45.12 --> 02:00:55.04
time. On this particular day, leadership comes in and a Ford range of pickup truck rolls in.

1283
02:00:56.08 --> 02:01:00.32
And I immediately see it, obviously, it sticks out to me because it's a violation of the SOP

1284
02:01:00.32 --> 02:01:04.64
that we developed and we've been executing two, three times a week for five and a half months.

1285
02:01:05.52 --> 02:01:10.32
Is it like a technical does it have a mounted machine gun in it? I wouldn't call it a technical,

1286
02:01:10.32 --> 02:01:15.52
but there was a mounted PKM in the back. I think a technical, I mean, I was in Eastern Africa,

1287
02:01:15.52 --> 02:01:20.96
there's like different kinds of like Mad Max technicals. Yeah. So it's not an upgraded technical,

1288
02:01:20.96 --> 02:01:26.32
it's like the lowest form of a technical possible. Yeah. You know, but a but a mounted PKM in the

1289
02:01:26.32 --> 02:01:30.80
back, 100% mounted PKM in the back that a machine gun to operate from a standing position.

1290
02:01:32.88 --> 02:01:38.72
That rolls in with two dudes and I see it and my first response wasn't oh,

1291
02:01:38.72 --> 02:01:44.40
shit, this is a threat. It was, you know, these idiots just can't follow instruction,

1292
02:01:44.40 --> 02:01:50.24
which is pretty common in Afghanistan. So my first response was just, I'm annoyed

1293
02:01:50.24 --> 02:01:55.28
that you're doing this. And now I'm at a crossroads, man. And it's either,

1294
02:01:56.24 --> 02:02:02.96
do I address this problem right now, an error on the side of security? Or do I let it ride?

1295
02:02:02.96 --> 02:02:09.36
I go the more diplomatic route where my team sergeant talks to his leadership or my commander

1296
02:02:09.36 --> 02:02:16.40
talks to his leadership and we handle it after the fact. I went with the more diplomatic option.

1297
02:02:16.40 --> 02:02:21.52
This is it. And you've been working, I mean, you've had this SOP, it's worked,

1298
02:02:21.52 --> 02:02:24.88
you've been working with a bunch of Afghans like, oh, these idiots,

1299
02:02:24.88 --> 02:02:29.28
it's all just kind of leaning you in that direction of like, these people are stupid.

1300
02:02:29.28 --> 02:02:33.60
And, you know, I'll square this away when we're done with the brief. Yeah, you know,

1301
02:02:33.60 --> 02:02:39.60
and it's easy to look back and judge, which I do to myself about how easy you can get complacent,

1302
02:02:40.40 --> 02:02:47.28
which is true. But when you've seen so many things that could have gone wrong, that didn't,

1303
02:02:47.84 --> 02:02:52.80
you become conditioned to these types of mistakes or these types of acts by your

1304
02:02:52.80 --> 02:02:59.28
partner force. It's not, they don't jump out as these glaring red flashing holy shit lights.

1305
02:03:00.24 --> 02:03:03.36
But I noticed it and I'm like, you know what, I'll deal with this later. Let's just get through

1306
02:03:03.36 --> 02:03:11.92
this mission and we'll address it after the fact. And this is the perfect storm because

1307
02:03:11.92 --> 02:03:16.08
we do the mission brief, get our partner force leadership up to speed on what we're doing.

1308
02:03:16.64 --> 02:03:19.84
And then we're doing our own team internal comms checks. So we're in a circle.

1309
02:03:19.84 --> 02:03:26.32
And, you know, you go around, you go around the circle, right? Like Alpha up Bravo one up Bravo

1310
02:03:26.32 --> 02:03:32.24
two up everyone's just checking comms. The trucks are all pretty much right behind me.

1311
02:03:32.24 --> 02:03:35.60
They're all up and running. Coms are good in the truck. Weapons are good in the truck. First

1312
02:03:35.60 --> 02:03:45.52
thing we do. Well, when I got our vehicle set up, I had left my go bag, my rifle, and then my

1313
02:03:45.52 --> 02:03:56.48
crew surf all inside the vehicle. Important lesson to note. I have my Glock on me and I'm overdoing

1314
02:03:57.36 --> 02:04:03.12
mission brief and final comps checks. Okay. My radio is good to go. And I immediately

1315
02:04:03.12 --> 02:04:07.44
turned stop walking towards my truck, right? Kind of insubordinate because you're really

1316
02:04:07.44 --> 02:04:10.40
supposed to stay there until everyone's good to go. Well, I'm like, I'm good. I can hear you.

1317
02:04:10.40 --> 02:04:16.40
You can hear me. I'm going to go get my vehicle. And I'm walking away from the group. And that's

1318
02:04:16.40 --> 02:04:23.44
when I hear the rounds crack off from behind me. And my first thought again was one of our Afghan

1319
02:04:23.44 --> 02:04:27.60
partners had just indeed their weapon, just negligently discharged their weapon, which also

1320
02:04:27.60 --> 02:04:32.40
wouldn't be unheard of. But after the second round, third round, fourth round, you know,

1321
02:04:32.40 --> 02:04:36.48
I can tell it's coming from a belt fed machine gun, like no, no, someone's deliberately shooting

1322
02:04:36.48 --> 02:04:42.72
at something. And I snap my head around. And one of those guys sure enough, I jumped up on the back

1323
02:04:42.72 --> 02:04:49.36
of that four range and was just opening up into the crowd. Perfect setup for that. We're all lumped

1324
02:04:49.36 --> 02:05:00.000
together. And he's, you know, 20 feet away with a PKM ripping into the crew. So I see that. And

1325
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:06.32
my first thought is move to cover, eliminate the threat, like just react to near ambush. And

1326
02:05:06.32 --> 02:05:12.16
although I've played this game now, I don't know, infinite amount of times in my mind, I wonder if

1327
02:05:12.16 --> 02:05:17.44
I had had my primary weapon system on me, would I have done what I am supposed to do? Because I had

1328
02:05:17.44 --> 02:05:23.68
cover right there. There were four or five armored trucks right next to me. Take a couple steps

1329
02:05:23.68 --> 02:05:31.60
over, weapon system comes up, problem goes away. And we move on with life. What I see,

1330
02:05:32.32 --> 02:05:39.44
after I see the shooter is one of our infantry uplift. Soldiers who was scheduled to be a driver

1331
02:05:39.44 --> 02:05:45.84
for us that day, frozen. And he's maybe eight feet in front of me. And he's like a deer in

1332
02:05:45.84 --> 02:05:51.12
headlights. And he's staring at a guy with a machine gun shooting in his direction, 15,

1333
02:05:51.12 --> 02:06:01.04
20 feet in front of him. I see that. And although I know what I'm supposed to do,

1334
02:06:02.48 --> 02:06:10.80
my love of a teammate superseded me doing my actual job. So instead of moving to some cover

1335
02:06:10.80 --> 02:06:17.76
and eliminating the threat, I move towards this kid. And I take maybe just like three, four aggressive

1336
02:06:17.76 --> 02:06:24.40
steps. I'm coming in pretty hot. And I get my back to the gunner and I get in front of this kid.

1337
02:06:25.20 --> 02:06:31.44
And that's when I'm hit for the first time, just below my right ass cheek, upper thigh, boom,

1338
02:06:32.56 --> 02:06:39.92
knocks me down on top of the soldier. And then I feel another two, three impacts to my legs.

1339
02:06:40.88 --> 02:06:47.36
So I know I'm hit. I don't know the, I don't know the severity of it, but I've been hit before.

1340
02:06:47.36 --> 02:06:54.56
I'm hit again. Okay, we'll deal with this here in a second. And I drag myself and this kid,

1341
02:06:54.56 --> 02:07:00.000
you know, maybe four or five feet behind the front corner of another truck to get us a little bit

1342
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:07.76
of cover. People are dropping all around us. People are scrambling. I get to this, this next location.

1343
02:07:08.80 --> 02:07:14.24
I don't have my rifle on me. There was a rifle laying on the ground next to me that I've seen

1344
02:07:14.24 --> 02:07:20.72
your medic. It was his weapon. He had been hit. I roll over, I grab that, I throw that into action.

1345
02:07:20.72 --> 02:07:27.68
I'm laying on my back. I put a couple horribly placed rounds towards this threat who's still

1346
02:07:27.68 --> 02:07:34.32
engaging. And then one of my teammates comes in and smokes this dude. This was the initiation of a

1347
02:07:34.32 --> 02:07:39.20
complex ambush. So we start taking machine gun fire and rockets from outside of the outside of the camp.

1348
02:07:39.20 --> 02:07:47.44
So immediate threats been removed. I can tell that we're in a firefight, but I'm in no position to

1349
02:07:47.44 --> 02:07:51.92
address any of those problems. So I go to my next course action and I check this soldier who I'm

1350
02:07:51.92 --> 02:07:59.12
still kind of laying on top of who's just in shock, but there's no holes in them and he can breathe.

1351
02:07:59.68 --> 02:08:03.92
So no massive, no massive hemorrhaging. He got an airway. Okay, we're good.

1352
02:08:03.92 --> 02:08:14.72
I now look to see how bad my damage is. So I ripped my pant leg open and my right leg is just mangled.

1353
02:08:15.92 --> 02:08:20.72
Doc's estimated it was probably four or five rounds I took to that leg. I took one to my

1354
02:08:20.72 --> 02:08:26.40
lower left leg, which I didn't even know about for like weeks, weeks later. The right leg was

1355
02:08:26.40 --> 02:08:32.96
definitely the problem. And the river of blood that was flowing from me to where I had initially

1356
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:44.64
been hit was substantial. So I know my femoral artery has been clipped. So time is, is of the

1357
02:08:44.64 --> 02:08:50.56
essence, right? I know due to training, I have probably maybe eight to 12 minutes before I'm

1358
02:08:50.56 --> 02:08:55.36
completely blood out. So I grab a kid, grab a tourniquet off my kid, I slap that on,

1359
02:08:55.36 --> 02:09:01.84
wrench it down, lock in the windlass. Bleeding doesn't stop. Second one goes on. I put a second

1360
02:09:01.84 --> 02:09:06.24
one on myself, put that down. Looks like the bleeding may have slowed down a little bit.

1361
02:09:08.24 --> 02:09:15.44
But I can tell I'm still bleeding. A teammate gets to me and he's like, you're in bad shit.

1362
02:09:15.44 --> 02:09:21.20
Like I had the look on his face, said everything I needed to know. He puts on a third tourniquet

1363
02:09:22.16 --> 02:09:28.24
and then he gets IV access for blood or from meds or whatever. And I was trying to like get him

1364
02:09:28.24 --> 02:09:32.72
away from me originally. Like I know I'm dead. Like I'm in the expecting category. Like I don't

1365
02:09:32.72 --> 02:09:37.84
know who's doing triage right now, but I need to be with the group that isn't going to make it.

1366
02:09:37.84 --> 02:09:41.28
I'm with the group that you don't waste your time on because I know there's a lot of people

1367
02:09:41.28 --> 02:09:45.84
that are down right now and I know that I'm not one that can be saved. So get like get away from me.

1368
02:09:46.96 --> 02:09:52.88
He ignores me and does what he needs to do. Third tourniquet IV access and then his work was pretty

1369
02:09:52.88 --> 02:10:02.96
much done. So he moves on. Well, I'm still confident that I'm still bleeding out. So I'm

1370
02:10:02.96 --> 02:10:08.08
thinking, man, have I done everything I can do? So I decided to grab some gauze out of my kit

1371
02:10:08.72 --> 02:10:14.40
and ball it up into a little power ball, just taking gauze and creating this little ball out of it.

1372
02:10:15.12 --> 02:10:21.12
I loosen up one of the tourniquets and I just wedge this gauze up into my thigh and I'm kind

1373
02:10:21.12 --> 02:10:29.36
of reaching up towards my hip looking for the to feel the pulse of the ottery. And we do training

1374
02:10:29.36 --> 02:10:35.44
to be able to do this, but it's on something else other than, you know, you. And when you're

1375
02:10:35.44 --> 02:10:43.52
bleeding at that volume, all the blood starts to shunt inwards to your organs to protect your body

1376
02:10:43.52 --> 02:10:48.80
to survive as long as you can. So my hands are real numb. I can't really feel anything.

1377
02:10:48.80 --> 02:10:55.12
I think I feel something. I'm brushing past broken FEMA. My FEMA was shattered. So now the pain is

1378
02:10:55.12 --> 02:11:01.28
really kicking in for the first time and I'm trying to stay conscious. I feel something. I think I

1379
02:11:01.28 --> 02:11:07.28
just wedge down as hard as I can. Press that gauze in, feed the rest of the gauze in on top of it,

1380
02:11:07.28 --> 02:11:19.36
re-secure the tourniquet on top, lock that in. And then my work there was pretty much done.

1381
02:11:20.08 --> 02:11:27.68
You cover that in the book. You say, this is going to hurt. I rammed the power ball into my leg,

1382
02:11:27.68 --> 02:11:32.56
reaching up toward my hip. It hurts. I'm feeling for the femoral artery. It needs direct pressure

1383
02:11:32.56 --> 02:11:37.44
to pinch the bleeding off. The problem is the remaining blood in my system is shunting away

1384
02:11:37.44 --> 02:11:44.32
from my extremities to protect my vital organs. My hands feel like meat mittens. Zero dexterity

1385
02:11:44.32 --> 02:11:50.000
or fine motor skills in my fingers. The only way I can tell I'm brushing past my shattered FEMA

1386
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.92
is the shearing shockwave it sends through my body. Going unconscious seems inevitable.

1387
02:11:55.92 --> 02:12:02.96
There it is. I think I feel a pulse inside my leg. No way to be sure, but the clock is ticking.

1388
02:12:03.52 --> 02:12:09.28
Only a matter of minutes, if that until I am completely blood out. And only matter of seconds

1389
02:12:09.28 --> 02:12:15.12
before I pass out. I ram the power ball down as hard as I can. The pain rips through my body,

1390
02:12:15.12 --> 02:12:20.32
attempting to eject from my eyeballs. I feed more gauze on top of the power ball,

1391
02:12:20.32 --> 02:12:25.92
just as our medics taught us. I re secure the tourniquet on top of it. Tighten the strap,

1392
02:12:25.92 --> 02:12:34.16
twist the windlass, lock it in and pass out. I wake up what I think is just a few moments later.

1393
02:12:34.16 --> 02:12:39.12
I wasn't out for long. I look at my leg and determine my work here is done.

1394
02:12:40.24 --> 02:12:44.48
All right, that's enough sleeping on the job. Get back to work. Be there for your brothers.

1395
02:12:44.48 --> 02:12:51.52
I drag myself maybe six feet to a teammate. He is taken around through the calf, nothing life

1396
02:12:51.52 --> 02:12:57.52
threatening, although certainly painful. The guys have applied some interventions already,

1397
02:12:57.52 --> 02:13:01.36
including a tourniquet, which seems to have stopped the bleeding, but he's in severe pain.

1398
02:13:02.16 --> 02:13:07.52
Note, tourniquet save lives and essential tool, but that comes with some impressive pain for the

1399
02:13:07.52 --> 02:13:14.32
patient. I do what I can to distract him, provide some verbal relief. My efforts create minimal

1400
02:13:14.32 --> 02:13:21.36
effects, but it is what I feel to be the best use of whatever time I have left, which I am certain

1401
02:13:21.36 --> 02:13:29.76
is not long. At some point, I go unconscious again. When I come to I'm being carried out on a stretcher.

1402
02:13:30.80 --> 02:13:37.76
Seems like they are preparing me for Medevac. I am right. How long has it been? How long was I

1403
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:46.72
unconscious? It doesn't matter. I'm still alive. Still in the fight. The bird touches down. My

1404
02:13:46.72 --> 02:13:53.84
teammates load me on. One of them grabs my face, looks me in the eyes and says, I love you, brother.

1405
02:13:56.16 --> 02:14:04.64
My heart is full. What an honor to have served with such men. What an honor to die alongside such

1406
02:14:04.64 --> 02:14:15.60
warriors.

1407
02:14:15.60 --> 02:14:37.20
Our Medevacs and our docs and our medical military operations are so good that a lot of time,

1408
02:14:37.20 --> 02:14:42.80
it's like, oh, if you get on the bird, if you're alive getting on the bird, there's a really good

1409
02:14:42.80 --> 02:14:53.84
chance you're going to make it. It doesn't sound like you're thinking that way. No. I just hearing

1410
02:14:53.84 --> 02:15:02.88
that you read that, like, puts me back in that place, man. I wasn't sure how long I had been

1411
02:15:04.08 --> 02:15:08.24
still on the ground, but I knew it was it was quite a bit of time. So

1412
02:15:08.24 --> 02:15:13.92
I was surprised that I was still even alive at that point.

1413
02:15:18.32 --> 02:15:21.36
I was convinced that that was it, though. That was where it was ended.

1414
02:15:28.24 --> 02:15:34.24
Your boys put cast all over that valley, by the way, drop all kinds of bombs. You're on the first

1415
02:15:34.24 --> 02:15:48.000
Medevac bird out, obviously. You get to the AOB surgery clinic. And this is freaking nuts.

1416
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.92
You get you need a blood transfusion because you've lost a ton of blood. And somehow,

1417
02:15:55.76 --> 02:16:01.36
you end up with the wrong type of blood. Wrong type of blood transfusion, which is

1418
02:16:01.36 --> 02:16:10.72
horrible. Do you remember any of that? You're not you're not conscious at this point, are you?

1419
02:16:10.72 --> 02:16:17.20
I remember being at that aid station. It's spotty. But I do remember getting pulled off the bird

1420
02:16:17.20 --> 02:16:23.20
and getting thrown on the table. And then just, you know, the Med Staff scrambling to work on me.

1421
02:16:23.20 --> 02:16:30.72
So the next they get you stable enough, or at least they think they get you stable enough

1422
02:16:31.44 --> 02:16:33.84
to get you from the aid station to to Bagram.

1423
02:16:35.52 --> 02:16:43.20
They don't know what the problem is with me other than I'm crashing hard. So they put me on a

1424
02:16:43.20 --> 02:16:48.24
helicopter to send me to Bagram where there's a full scale hospital. At this location that I was at

1425
02:16:48.24 --> 02:16:54.72
first was a full surgical team that certainly has medical capability. But once they put me on that

1426
02:16:54.72 --> 02:16:59.20
transfusion, everything began shutting down. They didn't know why, but they knew I needed to get to

1427
02:16:59.20 --> 02:17:06.000
Bagram immediately. It was while I was flying to Bagram, which was maybe a nine, 10 minute flight,

1428
02:17:06.80 --> 02:17:10.56
that they realized what happened with the blood because they were given my teammate,

1429
02:17:10.56 --> 02:17:17.12
my blood type, and they were giving me his. We have very similar last names. They both begin

1430
02:17:17.12 --> 02:17:22.16
with LA. So they just switched up the names. Well, they're pumping him full of positive,

1431
02:17:22.16 --> 02:17:26.72
which is my blood type, which is I'm a universal donor. I can give blood to anybody. So he's fine.

1432
02:17:27.84 --> 02:17:31.12
But when they looked to see what they were giving him, they were like,

1433
02:17:31.76 --> 02:17:35.92
wait a minute, and they looked to check to see what they just gave me. And it was like eight units.

1434
02:17:35.92 --> 02:17:41.92
I mean, it was a ton. That's what they, that's when they realized what happened. So I'm airborne.

1435
02:17:41.92 --> 02:17:48.32
And they call Bagram and they say, we just pumped Nick full of AB negative. There's no way he survives

1436
02:17:48.32 --> 02:17:54.000
this flight. I was already in critical condition to begin with. There's no way he survives the flight,

1437
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.96
just be prepared to receive his body when he gets there. And in a lot of ways, they were right.

1438
02:17:58.96 --> 02:18:05.20
I mean, I coded on that flight. And to your point, the flight medics were getting real creative

1439
02:18:05.76 --> 02:18:11.36
with keeping me alive. So panels and the whole thing is out. I think they were hitting me with

1440
02:18:11.36 --> 02:18:19.52
like shots of adrenaline and just like whatever tools they had to keep me clinging on. Pull me

1441
02:18:19.52 --> 02:18:25.60
off the bird, get me into surgery. They take my foot off immediately. Really, I mean, it was,

1442
02:18:25.60 --> 02:18:30.72
it was probably dead at that point, because now we're talking 90 minutes close to two hours since

1443
02:18:30.72 --> 02:18:35.28
the point of injury. But really, it was just trying to minimize how much damage my body was

1444
02:18:35.28 --> 02:18:43.60
trying to recover from. And then, uh, innovative dialysis, transfusion machines are just keeping

1445
02:18:43.60 --> 02:18:49.68
me alive, you know, at this point. And that was the, that was the case for like three or four days

1446
02:18:50.40 --> 02:18:51.04
at Bagram.

1447
02:18:54.72 --> 02:18:59.36
What's the first thing that you remember when you come back? Where are you?

1448
02:18:59.36 --> 02:19:07.92
I remember, um, coming to at Bagram a couple of times and I was restrained to the bed because I had

1449
02:19:07.92 --> 02:19:16.16
been trying to rip the breathing tube out when I would wake up. When you're, when you're

1450
02:19:16.16 --> 02:19:22.72
animated, you know, a machine is breathing for you. But when you try to breathe yourself against

1451
02:19:22.72 --> 02:19:27.28
that, it can throw off the timing of the machine. So it feels like you're like suffocating.

1452
02:19:27.28 --> 02:19:33.28
It's a horrible feeling. So I would, I was trying to get this tube out of my mouth when I would come to.

1453
02:19:33.76 --> 02:19:38.88
I don't remember doing that, but I just remember coming to and being like restrained to a bed

1454
02:19:39.44 --> 02:19:42.16
and wanting to, for someone to put me out of my misery.

1455
02:19:45.92 --> 02:19:50.16
And then when, when do you come to again? Like, what's your next memory? When's your first full,

1456
02:19:50.88 --> 02:19:55.28
when do they take you out of coma? When do they bring you back and let you start talking and thinking

1457
02:19:55.28 --> 02:20:04.24
and what does that happen? I remember, um, my now wife who was deployed and working at a Bagram.

1458
02:20:04.56 --> 02:20:13.12
I remember coming to a couple of times and seeing her bedside. I remember my sort of command, I'd be

1459
02:20:13.12 --> 02:20:19.76
in bedside a lot talking to me. But my last real memory is when they were moving me from

1460
02:20:19.76 --> 02:20:25.76
Bagram to load me on to a fixed wing bird to fly me to Germany, which took about five days for them

1461
02:20:25.76 --> 02:20:32.24
to stabilize me enough to survive the flight to Germany. I remember getting loaded on that bird,

1462
02:20:32.24 --> 02:20:37.76
which is wild. Those, those C-130s that are outfitted. It's like a hospital on, you know, with wings.

1463
02:20:38.64 --> 02:20:45.36
I remember getting on that flight. Um, I don't remember much from Germany. I was only there a day.

1464
02:20:45.36 --> 02:20:52.64
You know, you lost your leg at this point? No. Or your foot? No. No. Nope. Um, no recollection of

1465
02:20:52.64 --> 02:20:57.84
that, no knowledge of that. They took my leg up to the knee at Germany and then they flew me from

1466
02:20:57.84 --> 02:21:05.04
there to Walter Reed the next day. And I get to Walter Reed and my father was there. My mother

1467
02:21:05.04 --> 02:21:10.48
was there. I went straight into the intensive care unit, which is where I spent the next like

1468
02:21:10.48 --> 02:21:15.68
six weeks because it was still real touch and go. And it was around that. It was at that point that I

1469
02:21:15.68 --> 02:21:19.44
realized my leg was, was gone or at least a part of it was gone.

1470
02:21:23.44 --> 02:21:29.28
Did you think you were going to be, did they think was it when you realized you had lost your leg,

1471
02:21:29.28 --> 02:21:35.36
was it above the knee or below the knee? By the time I realized it was already above the knee.

1472
02:21:35.36 --> 02:21:44.32
Um, they had taken it above the knee at Walter Reed and the chief of ortho came in to the intensive

1473
02:21:44.32 --> 02:21:49.28
care unit and he, he looks at me and I'm whacked out. I'm on ketamine and a lot of it, you know,

1474
02:21:49.28 --> 02:21:54.88
I'm on a high cocktail of pain management meds. But he looks at me and he's like, Hey man, I'm

1475
02:21:54.88 --> 02:22:01.28
Dr. So-and-so chief ortho. Here's the situation. You've been here about three or four days.

1476
02:22:01.28 --> 02:22:08.08
Your leg, most of your leg is gone. What's left of it is riddled with bacteria and infection.

1477
02:22:09.04 --> 02:22:15.76
Any one of these things could kill you. So my staff wants to take you into surgery right now

1478
02:22:16.40 --> 02:22:22.24
and amputate your leg at the hip and just get rid of this problem that could kill you and just get

1479
02:22:22.24 --> 02:22:27.84
you on with life. But I think I can save more of your leg. I think I can save more of your leg

1480
02:22:27.84 --> 02:22:35.84
but I think I can save more of your leg. It's just going to be a street fight and I need you

1481
02:22:35.84 --> 02:22:40.64
like in the fight with me. And I just met this guy, you know, he's telling me that

1482
02:22:41.92 --> 02:22:47.04
this problem could kill me at any moment, but he wants to like slug it out with me. And I don't

1483
02:22:47.04 --> 02:22:52.32
think I really processed medically what he was saying. I just heard like, let's get into a fight

1484
02:22:52.32 --> 02:22:58.32
together. Do you want to do that? And I was like, yes. Who's got we taking? Yeah. Yeah, right.

1485
02:22:58.32 --> 02:23:01.68
Who's got we taking? We're going to hurt some people and you can never ask me about it again.

1486
02:23:01.68 --> 02:23:06.72
Who's got we taking? That was that was it. I think I just heard that and I said, let's do that.

1487
02:23:07.52 --> 02:23:17.04
And he said, okay. So that began my regiment of surgeries three or four times a week. And they

1488
02:23:17.04 --> 02:23:22.000
were just going in and amputating more and more and more cutting out dead tissue, cutting out more

1489
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:28.80
bone. Monday, Wednesday, Friday was kind of my typical routine. And then flushing me with antibiotics,

1490
02:23:29.36 --> 02:23:33.92
hoping that the infection would get taken care of. And then it was just rinse and repeat like that

1491
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:38.000
for, you know, a month or so, five weeks, six weeks, something like that until the infection

1492
02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.48
eventually stopped, which left me with pretty much what I have today.

1493
02:23:42.48 --> 02:23:52.16
Oh, yeah, let's do it. You got a section in here where you're talking about as you begin

1494
02:23:53.84 --> 02:24:01.84
as you begin rehab. So you get right into it says on one particular day, I was walking my

1495
02:24:01.84 --> 02:24:06.32
laps around the track. So I'm fast forwarding a little bit, right? Obviously, there's and when

1496
02:24:06.32 --> 02:24:10.16
you get the book, you can get some of these other details. I'm fast forward a little bit.

1497
02:24:10.16 --> 02:24:13.44
One particular day I was walking my laps around the track one step at a time.

1498
02:24:14.48 --> 02:24:19.28
It was packed. In fact, in fact, a bunch of New York Yankees were there visiting service members.

1499
02:24:19.28 --> 02:24:24.40
I typically avoided these meet and greet moments like the plague when I was working. Kelly knew

1500
02:24:24.40 --> 02:24:31.12
this and Kelly was your rehab physical therapist physical therapist. Kelly knew this and did an

1501
02:24:31.12 --> 02:24:34.64
amazing job of shielding me from unnecessary distractions. I'm pretty sure she literally

1502
02:24:34.64 --> 02:24:39.76
hissed at a dude one time like an angry cat. Given that on this day, it was the Yankees. I was

1503
02:24:39.76 --> 02:24:47.20
even less interested. Go socks. I was in a good stride. My prosthetic had had a solid fit that

1504
02:24:47.20 --> 02:24:52.56
day and I needed to push it. I decided to hold a 90 pound barbell straight overhead in order to

1505
02:24:52.56 --> 02:24:58.48
increase the difficulty. Off I went shoulders burning core burning glutes burning perfect.

1506
02:24:58.48 --> 02:25:02.88
We were working. I picked up speed. I didn't have a set number of laps in mind. I just planned

1507
02:25:02.88 --> 02:25:08.80
on going until I couldn't go anymore. My body began to twitch uncontrollably. Fatigue set in.

1508
02:25:08.80 --> 02:25:13.20
I was right at muscle failure. I got one more lap in me. Let's go. I rounded the corner of the track

1509
02:25:13.20 --> 02:25:17.52
and lost my balance. I already knew how this was going to play out. My wipeout was of epic

1510
02:25:17.52 --> 02:25:23.44
proportions. The barbell went one way, my body, the other and my prosthetic detached completely.

1511
02:25:23.44 --> 02:25:27.92
It was a totally yard sale. The barbell slammed on the floor, clanging around, looking for a

1512
02:25:27.92 --> 02:25:31.92
target. It found the legs of a physical therapist who was coaching a patient through a stationary

1513
02:25:31.92 --> 02:25:37.28
bike workout. The therapist fell on her back with a thud knocking the wind out of her. My body went

1514
02:25:37.28 --> 02:25:41.84
flailing into a rack of medicine balls neatly organized according to weight. The heavier ones

1515
02:25:41.84 --> 02:25:46.16
at the bottom, the lighter ones at top, all of which were now bouncing or rolling in all directions

1516
02:25:46.16 --> 02:25:51.12
through the facility. The photo op with the Yankees stopped. The stretches stopped. All

1517
02:25:51.12 --> 02:25:55.76
conversations stopped. Everything stopped. As I lay on the ground, I conducted a quick damage

1518
02:25:55.76 --> 02:26:00.80
assessment. Fingers, arms, leg, head, everything seemed to be functioning. The therapist I knocked

1519
02:26:00.80 --> 02:26:06.40
over regained her breathing ability. I asked if she was all right. She was fine and asked the

1520
02:26:06.40 --> 02:26:11.84
same of me. I looked around the gym to see that nobody had moved an inch. Nobody, including Kelly,

1521
02:26:11.84 --> 02:26:16.56
had made the slightest attempt to either slow me down before I wrecked or come to my aid once I did.

1522
02:26:16.56 --> 02:26:22.16
It was business as usual. I strapped my leg back on and staggered over to Kelly. The only damage

1523
02:26:22.16 --> 02:26:30.000
was to my pride. You good? She asked. Yeah, I'm good. Think I didn't swing completely through

1524
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:35.52
and my foot hit the ground behind me. Yeah, that sounds right. Now go pick up those med balls and

1525
02:26:35.52 --> 02:26:42.32
meet me over at the squat rack. So you're freaking good. How long was it? How long was it that you

1526
02:26:42.32 --> 02:26:47.44
were like laid up? You're getting the surgeries before you got fitted for a prosthetic and all

1527
02:26:47.44 --> 02:26:53.76
that? Yeah, I got fitted for my first prosthetic probably 10, 12 weeks after getting there.

1528
02:26:54.96 --> 02:27:00.16
And which is, you know, a monumental step in the process. Unfortunately, this is quite common.

1529
02:27:00.16 --> 02:27:06.48
I needed a couple surgical revisions after that had happened, which is really difficult to deal with

1530
02:27:06.48 --> 02:27:12.48
because it pretty much puts you back at square one. You know, your leg changes shape. The swelling

1531
02:27:12.48 --> 02:27:17.36
sets in. You have to wait until you can get recast it for another prosthetic. It kind of starts

1532
02:27:17.36 --> 02:27:22.40
that clock over again. I had to go through that twice, you know, in those setbacks. And I talk

1533
02:27:22.40 --> 02:27:27.92
about this often, you know, like that's what separates those that can continue to make the

1534
02:27:27.92 --> 02:27:33.28
strides. And oftentimes is what just derails people. They just can't deal with that, with that

1535
02:27:33.28 --> 02:27:38.72
setback. How long was this like a five week, eight week setback? Yeah, no, I'd say maybe around three

1536
02:27:38.72 --> 02:27:43.76
or four. Okay. But they don't man, that's freaking, you know, yeah, it's tough because you're making

1537
02:27:43.76 --> 02:27:47.68
that you can see the progress you're making and then boom, you're back to where you were. And this

1538
02:27:47.68 --> 02:27:52.88
is like a revision. They do surgery. They fit you with a prosthetic. You start walking on all of

1539
02:27:52.88 --> 02:27:57.36
a sudden like the way your bone is, is jacked up or it's sticking out or something. And they've

1540
02:27:57.36 --> 02:28:02.16
got to go in there and shave that thing down. Yep. Exactly that. And then you got to get all

1541
02:28:02.16 --> 02:28:10.64
healed up and start again. Yeah. So what you just read was probably around July timeframe,

1542
02:28:10.64 --> 02:28:16.72
where I was done with surgeries. And I was really making substantial progress, working with my

1543
02:28:16.72 --> 02:28:23.52
prosthetic. I got to the hospital and match. So, you know, a few months after that was when I was

1544
02:28:23.52 --> 02:28:30.16
done with surgeries completely. And I was really getting after it. Freaking walking around with

1545
02:28:30.16 --> 02:28:37.52
a prosthetic with 90 pound barbell over your head. Yeah. You were going freaking hard. I was,

1546
02:28:38.80 --> 02:28:45.12
I was, I mean, my level of obsession, because I could already see where I was going. Like I knew

1547
02:28:45.12 --> 02:28:49.68
what was in front of me was getting back to the team that happened in the hospital.

1548
02:28:49.68 --> 02:28:54.80
Even before I was on a prosthetic, I was like, I'm going back to my lifestyle and my profession.

1549
02:28:55.44 --> 02:29:00.32
So these training sessions, this was, this was my life. Yeah. You immediately knew you're going

1550
02:29:00.32 --> 02:29:06.16
to go back to an ODA. 100%. Which by the way, in case this wasn't clear, you have no leg.

1551
02:29:07.12 --> 02:29:13.28
Right. And you're saying I'm going back to an ODA. Right. People are actually trying to get you

1552
02:29:13.28 --> 02:29:19.84
to freaking chill out and trying to, you know, that's kind of a funny way of saying it, but people

1553
02:29:19.84 --> 02:29:26.08
are actually trying to get you to adjust your expectations for your life. And you have a section

1554
02:29:26.08 --> 02:29:35.76
in here where it's one of those scenarios. April 2013, my father tells this story better than I do,

1555
02:29:35.76 --> 02:29:40.48
as I heard it only second hand, but on one particular day, a psych came in to visit me

1556
02:29:40.48 --> 02:29:45.84
and I had just been wheeled out for surgery. My father told the doc the deal and they began

1557
02:29:45.84 --> 02:29:51.36
talking a bit. The psych explained to my father that I was continuously talking about returning to

1558
02:29:51.36 --> 02:29:57.52
my job on an SF detachment, doing the same things I had done before, etc. He further explained to

1559
02:29:57.52 --> 02:30:03.28
my father that he felt I was perhaps in a state of shock or denial, simply due to the drugs not

1560
02:30:03.28 --> 02:30:09.44
yet aware of the severity of my situation. He essentially warned my father that at some point

1561
02:30:09.44 --> 02:30:14.48
I would be made aware of how badly I was injured and that the likelihood of me doing what I intended

1562
02:30:14.48 --> 02:30:19.84
to do was extraordinarily unlikely, perhaps impossible. He simply wanted my father to be

1563
02:30:19.84 --> 02:30:24.96
prepared to deal with what could potentially be a dramatic severe fall into depression.

1564
02:30:26.24 --> 02:30:31.44
In hindsight, I may have had the same thoughts and concerns as he did. After all, I was on an

1565
02:30:31.44 --> 02:30:36.32
enormous amount of medication. I was in surgery three times a week and I had expressed my intentions

1566
02:30:36.32 --> 02:30:42.24
were unpro— and my expressed intentions were unprecedented. Additionally, I am positive he

1567
02:30:42.24 --> 02:30:48.000
had seen this cause and effect happen throughout his medical career. So I get it. No hard feelings,

1568
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:54.32
doc. My father expressed his appreciation for the information and analysis before telling the psych

1569
02:30:54.32 --> 02:30:59.60
that he didn't like— that he didn't see that as likely to happen. My father explained that he

1570
02:30:59.60 --> 02:31:05.12
felt I knew what was going on. I had amazingly accepted the reality of my situation and just as

1571
02:31:05.12 --> 02:31:10.64
quickly had already focused on the next evolution. He told the doc this is just who Nick is.

1572
02:31:11.60 --> 02:31:17.28
My father knows me as well as anybody. He's my best friend in this world. He knew that I knew

1573
02:31:17.28 --> 02:31:24.000
my current situation and that even while doped up with enough painkillers and anesthesia to kill

1574
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:37.20
a horse, I was already formulating a plan. Freakin' ready to rock, man.

1575
02:31:38.96 --> 02:31:46.48
You were there. Just mentally there. Yeah, man. I was at— how long are you in Waltz Reed for?

1576
02:31:46.48 --> 02:31:59.84
About a year. Total. And that you just— you report in here that it was great for you. Like,

1577
02:32:00.40 --> 02:32:05.20
the medical support that you got, the people there, the people that were training you were just

1578
02:32:05.76 --> 02:32:07.52
freaking good to go. Amazing.

1579
02:32:07.52 --> 02:32:16.80
How is it happening? How does it progress? Like, what happens when the chain of command

1580
02:32:16.80 --> 02:32:18.64
here is that you want to come back? What are they saying?

1581
02:32:19.76 --> 02:32:24.56
So, I mean, I was in communication with them while I was in the hospital and they come visit me

1582
02:32:24.56 --> 02:32:30.16
every now and then and we just maintain comms. But it wasn't so much about tell me what your—

1583
02:32:30.16 --> 02:32:33.68
what your goals are when you get back. It was just how you're doing. Do you need anything? Has

1584
02:32:33.68 --> 02:32:39.36
your family, right? That was the focus. When I left Walter Reed and got back to Bragg,

1585
02:32:40.72 --> 02:32:44.40
I reported back over to their group and I met with the group command team

1586
02:32:45.92 --> 02:32:50.000
the first day in their office. And of course, they're like, welcome back. You look great.

1587
02:32:51.28 --> 02:32:55.92
I'm still early on in the process. I've been in amputee for about a year. So,

1588
02:32:56.96 --> 02:33:01.04
I'm no physical specimen. I'm still hobbling. I'm still limping. I'm still trying to figure

1589
02:33:01.04 --> 02:33:06.08
out how to live life with one leg and I'm sitting in their office. And they eventually asked me,

1590
02:33:06.08 --> 02:33:10.56
so, like, what are your goals? What are you looking to do? And I told them that. I was like,

1591
02:33:10.56 --> 02:33:20.16
I'm going back to the team. And they just said, okay, is that something that you think you can

1592
02:33:20.16 --> 02:33:25.92
do now? And I said, no, no, no, no. I have a lot of work I still need to do. But that's where things

1593
02:33:25.92 --> 02:33:33.28
are going. In the interim, you know, I need a job. I need to provide value here. So, I requested to

1594
02:33:33.28 --> 02:33:38.40
go to the combatives committee to work as an instructor. So, it's a great fit, you know,

1595
02:33:38.40 --> 02:33:46.16
a long time, like combatives dude. And they granted that request. I haven't talked to these guys,

1596
02:33:46.16 --> 02:33:52.80
you know, years later about this exact moment. They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, I've all told

1597
02:33:52.80 --> 02:33:57.84
me, like we had to do everything in our power to hold back, like the crazy one-eyed look, like,

1598
02:33:57.84 --> 02:34:05.36
what did you just say? Or go down the expectation management kind of brief, that I was getting

1599
02:34:05.36 --> 02:34:10.88
quite a bit at the hospital. They had to fight the urge to do both of those things. And just stay

1600
02:34:10.88 --> 02:34:17.60
kind of cool and neutral. Because they wanted to be supportive of me, right? But as a leader,

1601
02:34:17.60 --> 02:34:24.56
right? Like you also want to be practical to a degree. So, you know, I understand that. They

1602
02:34:24.56 --> 02:34:30.24
didn't think that what I intended to do was, was possible. I didn't think that that was going to

1603
02:34:30.24 --> 02:34:37.20
happen. But they did grant me the request to work as an instructor. And that's when the game really,

1604
02:34:37.20 --> 02:34:42.24
like went up significantly. Because as amazing as the staff is at Walter Reed, their job is to

1605
02:34:42.24 --> 02:34:46.88
keep you alive. And they get you as functional as you can be to live the rest of your life

1606
02:34:46.88 --> 02:34:51.76
with whatever condition you're dealing with. They're not there to train someone to go back

1607
02:34:51.76 --> 02:34:57.60
to an ODA. That's not their job. The guys in my unit, that is their job. So I knew I needed to get

1608
02:34:57.60 --> 02:35:06.24
back to Bragg ASAP to begin training with those guys and gals. First, they needed a job, which my

1609
02:35:06.24 --> 02:35:10.64
unit gave me. And then I knew I needed to fight this thing administratively, which I didn't know

1610
02:35:10.64 --> 02:35:16.32
what that looked like. But I knew it was going to trigger a medical evaluation board, which I referred

1611
02:35:16.32 --> 02:35:23.28
to as a military eviction board, because that's really what they're like, programmed to do. And

1612
02:35:23.28 --> 02:35:28.48
in their defense, most of the guys or gals or service members that they see are looking to

1613
02:35:28.48 --> 02:35:33.36
transition out. So they do place a lot of emphasis on, let's make sure we get your VA rating where it

1614
02:35:33.36 --> 02:35:38.88
needs to be all the documentation, get you maybe an internship for what life looks like as a civilian.

1615
02:35:38.88 --> 02:35:44.08
That's what they're there to do. And I walked in and I'm like, I'm going back to the team.

1616
02:35:44.08 --> 02:35:48.80
And the first person I got linked up with that kind of quarterback you through that process,

1617
02:35:49.68 --> 02:35:56.40
just didn't get it. He just didn't get it. And I fired that guy, which I didn't know I could do.

1618
02:35:58.40 --> 02:36:04.000
But I threw enough of a tepidantrum and talked to his boss. And I was like, you either need to get

1619
02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.96
me someone who's on the same page as me, or I'm just going to do this myself. So he was cool.

1620
02:36:08.96 --> 02:36:13.60
He linked me up with this girl who was amazing. My name is Rachel. And she had worked with

1621
02:36:13.60 --> 02:36:20.16
some SF guys that remained on active duty. So she became my girl and she was on the same page as me.

1622
02:36:22.72 --> 02:36:26.88
The admin fight happened at that point, which took about eight months of time.

1623
02:36:27.76 --> 02:36:35.04
So I'm working as an instructor day to day. And I've really just taken the same mentality I had

1624
02:36:35.04 --> 02:36:40.40
at Walter Reed, which in a lot of ways is easier to maintain this because you're living in this

1625
02:36:40.40 --> 02:36:44.96
bubble where your only job is to go to these appointments and you're like living at Walter

1626
02:36:44.96 --> 02:36:51.76
Reed. Once you get home, you got your friends. In my instance, I had my girl who I moved in with.

1627
02:36:51.76 --> 02:36:59.12
Like, does it do these other factors that a part of your life that can distract you or detract from

1628
02:36:59.12 --> 02:37:05.52
the mission? So I had to take the same mentality I had in the hospital and apply that to a normal

1629
02:37:05.52 --> 02:37:12.48
living environment. And with just within the first week of being home, I had to make some real hard

1630
02:37:12.48 --> 02:37:20.000
choices and eliminate anything that didn't need to be there, complete and total reevaluation of how

1631
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.88
I spend every single minute of my day. And if you didn't need to be there, if it didn't need to be there,

1632
02:37:24.88 --> 02:37:33.04
both tasks and people, it was removed. And with tasks, I think it's easier to say, I'm not going

1633
02:37:33.04 --> 02:37:37.28
to watch Netflix anymore. But when you start talking about removing relationships from your life,

1634
02:37:37.28 --> 02:37:45.44
that can be real difficult to do. And I sat down with my now wife. And this is like the courting

1635
02:37:45.44 --> 02:37:50.40
phase of our relationship, right? Like she was in Afghanistan when I got banged up.

1636
02:37:50.40 --> 02:37:53.52
And what was she doing in Afghanistan? What was her job?

1637
02:37:53.52 --> 02:37:57.84
She's active duty. At the time, she was doing psychological operations.

1638
02:37:57.84 --> 02:38:05.76
Got it. But we hadn't spent any real time together. And then I move in with her. And within the first

1639
02:38:05.76 --> 02:38:11.36
week, I sit down with her. I said, Hey, babe, here's the deal. I'm going all in.

1640
02:38:11.36 --> 02:38:18.16
Hey, just real quick. When you're communicating with your significant other, a good way to not

1641
02:38:18.16 --> 02:38:23.84
start this conversation is, Hey, look, here's the deal. So we're getting off to a good start, bro.

1642
02:38:23.84 --> 02:38:29.04
Yeah. All right. Here's the deal. It was the truth, though. Like there was no alternative.

1643
02:38:29.04 --> 02:38:34.24
This is the deal. This isn't like a course of action. This is the way it's going to be.

1644
02:38:34.24 --> 02:38:41.76
I just wanted to be transparent. I'm going all in on this, like complete and total, burn the boats.

1645
02:38:41.76 --> 02:38:46.48
Like, I'm either going to be successful, or I'm going to die trying. That's it. Not negotiable.

1646
02:38:46.48 --> 02:38:53.36
I have to do this. And what that means on the tactical level is that there are no dinners.

1647
02:38:53.36 --> 02:38:58.88
There's no, we're going to go to this wedding. There's no like nothing, nothing, everything gone.

1648
02:38:59.76 --> 02:39:06.000
It's each sleep train repeat until I get successful or they kick me out of the army. That's it.

1649
02:39:07.28 --> 02:39:15.92
And I look back at that conversation now with the family we have, we're married now,

1650
02:39:15.92 --> 02:39:22.48
six years, two young kids, the highlight of my life, most important thing in my life by a mile.

1651
02:39:22.48 --> 02:39:28.96
And all that could have very easily just non-existed if she didn't have the strength to

1652
02:39:29.60 --> 02:39:33.76
be okay with the somewhat craziness that I was communicating to her.

1653
02:39:36.72 --> 02:39:43.68
So I'm incredibly grateful that that happened. It can be tough to talk about because

1654
02:39:44.96 --> 02:39:51.20
it could have all just not been a thing. She was like, okay, Roger that.

1655
02:39:51.20 --> 02:39:58.000
And I think what enabled that was she was also aggressively pursuing her next echelon,

1656
02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.24
her next evolution in her career. So she was really dialed in professionally as well.

1657
02:40:02.24 --> 02:40:08.96
So we were both going down in parallel these hyper-focused roads towards our professional

1658
02:40:08.96 --> 02:40:14.24
ambitions at the same time, which helped because she had stuff that she needed to do,

1659
02:40:14.24 --> 02:40:17.68
stuff I needed to do. We'd come together when we could, but it was an interesting

1660
02:40:17.68 --> 02:40:21.84
introduction to our relationship with all this was going on.

1661
02:40:22.96 --> 02:40:28.32
So eight month process of a med board, I'm working as an instructor and I'm just living

1662
02:40:28.32 --> 02:40:34.48
just this completely and total dialed in, minute to minute, hour to hour lifestyle.

1663
02:40:35.28 --> 02:40:42.000
Obviously a lot of physical training was involved. And after about eight months,

1664
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.32
med board complete, the army allowed me to stay in on active duty. Then that check,

1665
02:40:48.32 --> 02:40:51.76
that box was checked and then it was, okay, now I need to get back to the team.

1666
02:40:51.76 --> 02:40:54.40
And now I need to figure out how to go about doing that.

1667
02:40:55.12 --> 02:41:02.72
And it sounds like there's a really specific list of things that you needed to be able to do.

1668
02:41:02.72 --> 02:41:08.32
Like, is it some kind of test, like a fit for duty test? Is that like there was certain tasks

1669
02:41:08.32 --> 02:41:12.16
you had to be able to do? And where's that list come from?

1670
02:41:13.76 --> 02:41:20.56
It was created in real time by my chain of command. There wasn't this laid out pipeline.

1671
02:41:22.32 --> 02:41:25.92
It started off simple. It was go do an army physical fitness test.

1672
02:41:25.92 --> 02:41:32.72
Okay, you did that. And then they threw every army physical fitness program of record at me.

1673
02:41:32.72 --> 02:41:38.88
And once I checked all those blocks, then they started just throwing other stuff at me.

1674
02:41:39.60 --> 02:41:43.20
So they had me, I was getting evaluated cognitively,

1675
02:41:45.44 --> 02:41:50.000
proficiency, they ran me back over to the 18 Bravo committee, which is where I learned how to

1676
02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:56.000
be an 18 Bravo, they threw me back over there for like a one week, two week, train up evaluation

1677
02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:01.36
to see if I can still do my job as a Bravo. They put me in front of psych screening, which

1678
02:42:01.36 --> 02:42:08.000
which no one's admitted this to me yet directly. But I'm confident when I say I was, I was operating

1679
02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:14.32
at such an insane pace and intensity that people thought I was like legitimately crazy.

1680
02:42:15.60 --> 02:42:20.48
You know, people thought I had like a diagnosable problem, whether that was delusional or like

1681
02:42:20.48 --> 02:42:24.48
psychopathic. Like we need to get this guy's mental well being checked out. Cause I think

1682
02:42:24.48 --> 02:42:29.84
he's insane and needs like treatment. The site came back and was like, yeah, he's no crazier

1683
02:42:29.84 --> 02:42:34.32
than he was before. So he's, he's good at this time you're teaching combatives,

1684
02:42:34.32 --> 02:42:37.92
which is who you're teaching combatives to, is it within your own battalion or is it like

1685
02:42:37.92 --> 02:42:42.48
who you teach in combatives to the group? So third group, so third group, you're teaching combatives,

1686
02:42:43.44 --> 02:42:49.44
you're, and then you're just PT and to try and get to be able to do this job. Yep. PT and doing

1687
02:42:49.44 --> 02:42:55.52
a ton of Jiu-Jitsu, competing in Jiu-Jitsu as well, which is a huge part of this overall journey

1688
02:42:55.52 --> 02:43:00.72
is what is that piece of it that not just from a training perspective, but just mentality and

1689
02:43:00.72 --> 02:43:06.48
structure and like technical focus on what I'm doing, adaptation to how do I, how do I do this

1690
02:43:06.48 --> 02:43:10.40
with just one limb now, one leg now. Were you like a purple belt when this thing kicked off?

1691
02:43:11.28 --> 02:43:18.96
No, I was a white belt. I got my blue and my purple after I lost my leg.

1692
02:43:20.40 --> 02:43:25.20
But you trained before you lost your leg. I did. Yeah. I trained. I got into Jiu-Jitsu right after

1693
02:43:25.20 --> 02:43:30.48
I really, I graduated the Q course. So I did that on two legs for a while. And then my Jiu-Jitsu

1694
02:43:30.48 --> 02:43:35.92
journey as an APT started at Walter Reed, they had a local black belt who owned a studio downtown

1695
02:43:35.92 --> 02:43:42.48
Washington who would come to the hospital one day a week. Who's that? Jose. It's like Ortiz.

1696
02:43:43.04 --> 02:43:48.40
His name. Good on him. Awesome dude. I met him at the hospital and then I began training. He

1697
02:43:48.40 --> 02:43:53.60
invited me over into his, into his dojo. So I began training there like three, four nights a week.

1698
02:43:53.60 --> 02:43:58.40
You know, one thing that you, and I forget if I'm going to cover this or not in the book,

1699
02:43:58.40 --> 02:44:04.24
but I want to talk about it anyways. You got this thing that really like struck a chord with me.

1700
02:44:04.24 --> 02:44:11.60
So you explain that when you got a prosthetic, when you put that thing on, there's a clock that

1701
02:44:11.60 --> 02:44:18.72
starts because you can only wear it for so long. And there's a bunch of factors. If it's hot out,

1702
02:44:18.72 --> 02:44:24.32
what activity you're doing. And it made you, that was one of the things that kind of drove this,

1703
02:44:24.32 --> 02:44:30.24
this efficiency in you. Cause you go, okay, when I get this thing on, I have X amount of hours to

1704
02:44:30.24 --> 02:44:36.40
operate walking around. And after that, I got to take it off. And that's, that was one of the

1705
02:44:36.40 --> 02:44:41.84
things you said, okay, as soon as I get this thing on, here's what I got to get done. And that struck

1706
02:44:41.84 --> 02:44:47.12
a chord with me. Cause like that's the attitude you should have regardless in life is like, oh,

1707
02:44:47.12 --> 02:44:51.60
you're going to wake up today. You only have so many hours, but that put a, put an exclamation

1708
02:44:51.60 --> 02:44:57.04
point on that for you. Yeah. I'd say that, you know, having been in the military and special ops

1709
02:44:57.04 --> 02:45:01.60
for, for a bit before this, I was used to living, you know, structured discipline lifestyle, but

1710
02:45:03.04 --> 02:45:08.40
the forcing function of knowing I needed to be able to execute at the highest possible level.

1711
02:45:09.84 --> 02:45:13.84
In order to do that, I needed to be as efficient as possible. You said it, it was about efficiency.

1712
02:45:13.84 --> 02:45:21.20
How do I maximize every moment I have upright on two legs? And I got, I developed a bit of OCD on

1713
02:45:21.20 --> 02:45:26.88
that because if I would, if I would go to leave my house and I would leave something and I'd walk

1714
02:45:26.88 --> 02:45:32.40
12 steps before I realized I forgot it, that would, that would irritate me because now that's,

1715
02:45:32.40 --> 02:45:37.68
that's 24 steps. I'm not getting back. So there's a, there's a glitch in my system. There's a glitch

1716
02:45:37.68 --> 02:45:43.36
in my, in my protocol. Things aren't prepped where they need to be. This mistake can't happen.

1717
02:45:43.36 --> 02:45:49.60
Again, cause I just lost 24 steps. So I mean, I was dissecting like where I put my phone,

1718
02:45:49.60 --> 02:45:56.16
my keys, my walk, like to the, like to the inch within my life so that I didn't lose 24 steps

1719
02:45:56.16 --> 02:46:04.08
ever again. You were freaking committed to this thing. How, what was the, what was the biggest

1720
02:46:04.08 --> 02:46:09.44
challenge as you, as they threw all these different tests at you, right? They're throwing the army

1721
02:46:09.44 --> 02:46:16.16
PT test at you. They throw this other test at you. What was something that really was a challenger?

1722
02:46:16.80 --> 02:46:20.80
What was the hardest thing? Yeah, the final, the final physical evaluation,

1723
02:46:20.80 --> 02:46:24.88
which was my final overall evaluation was the, was by five, the hottest one. This was at the end

1724
02:46:24.88 --> 02:46:31.12
of about 12 weeks where I was doing one or two assessments a week. And third group, again,

1725
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:37.20
only operated in Afghanistan. They were dealing with a lot of injuries. So third group took it

1726
02:46:37.20 --> 02:46:42.32
upon themselves to create what they called originally the return to duty physical fitness

1727
02:46:42.32 --> 02:46:46.16
assessment. And that was specifically for guys that were wounded that wanted to go back to

1728
02:46:46.16 --> 02:46:51.68
operational status. They spent months putting this thing together. This was while I was at the hospital.

1729
02:46:52.48 --> 02:46:58.40
And they were telling me about it a little bit and they developed it out. They ran, you know, able

1730
02:46:58.40 --> 02:47:04.32
body guys through it to develop the standards. And it was more of more tasks that were more in line

1731
02:47:04.32 --> 02:47:09.68
with a combat scenario. So as opposed to just, you know, push up setups and running, it was

1732
02:47:10.96 --> 02:47:16.88
tactical tasks like move to cover type drills. Everything's done with a 50 pound weighted vest

1733
02:47:16.88 --> 02:47:22.96
to simulate kit. Most were done with a rubber duck rifle. So it was more tactical tasks,

1734
02:47:23.84 --> 02:47:28.88
12 events in total. Well, the day before I took mine, this was like my Super Bowl.

1735
02:47:28.88 --> 02:47:36.80
And my training for about six weeks or so leading up to that point was mostly focused on those

1736
02:47:36.80 --> 02:47:45.20
particular tasks. The day before I went in the gym just to loosen up, get some blood flow, get ready

1737
02:47:45.20 --> 02:47:51.60
for my next for the test to happen the following morning. And the group command sergeant major and

1738
02:47:52.16 --> 02:47:56.64
another dude who had been shot through the hand who was trying to go back to the team,

1739
02:47:56.64 --> 02:48:02.80
to the team, they both took it that morning. So I walk in the gym to loosen up and they're both

1740
02:48:02.80 --> 02:48:08.48
sprawled out on the turf, drenched and exhausted. Group command sergeant major is Mark Eckard.

1741
02:48:08.48 --> 02:48:15.84
He just recently retired. He was the most recent use of socks CSM. He's a stud. He's a PT stud able

1742
02:48:15.84 --> 02:48:23.28
body dude stud. He's out on the turf, both of them. I walk over and hey, Sergeant Major, how you doing?

1743
02:48:23.28 --> 02:48:28.80
He's like, not great because that test just kicked my ass. He's like, you're taking this thing

1744
02:48:28.80 --> 02:48:35.44
tomorrow morning. I said, yeah, he's like, this thing's no joke. And I knew it was brutal. I had

1745
02:48:35.44 --> 02:48:42.88
never taken it entirely in its entirety to standard once because I knew it was going to break me off.

1746
02:48:42.88 --> 02:48:47.60
So in my training, I was playing around with different resistances, but I would just lump

1747
02:48:47.60 --> 02:48:53.04
together different groups of them and go back to back to back in repetition. I said, yeah,

1748
02:48:53.04 --> 02:48:56.96
tomorrow morning, he's like, okay, well, I'll be here. You know, good luck. I said, thank you.

1749
02:48:56.96 --> 02:49:02.000
So I show up the next morning. Group command team, battalion command team, company command team,

1750
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:07.12
and about 50 other dudes are all there. There's a massive entourage. They basically closed the gym.

1751
02:49:08.32 --> 02:49:12.08
Or at least no one was training because everyone was just there to watch. There's my teammates are

1752
02:49:12.08 --> 02:49:22.24
there. And I knocked that out. And the final event on this thing is it doesn't sound bad,

1753
02:49:22.24 --> 02:49:26.88
but it's actually quite miserable. The 12th event and I think you had, I think it was two minutes

1754
02:49:26.88 --> 02:49:35.44
in between each event. The final one, the 12th one is just as a walk on an incline of treadmill.

1755
02:49:35.44 --> 02:49:42.32
And it starts off flat and then every two minutes it increases in elevation. So at the final point,

1756
02:49:42.32 --> 02:49:49.12
you're walking at a 45 degree angle, which is steep. It's at a slow pace, you know, it's like a fast

1757
02:49:49.12 --> 02:49:55.44
like a brisk walk. So you're doing this 50 pound weighted vest 12th event. Well, my issue, similar

1758
02:49:55.44 --> 02:49:59.84
to the way I wiped out there, Walter Reed, was because of the lack of range of motion I have in

1759
02:49:59.84 --> 02:50:07.36
my hip. When the angle is that steep, I can't get my foot out in front of me. So I had to develop

1760
02:50:07.36 --> 02:50:13.20
a technique where once it hit a certain degree of elevation, I would rotate my body laterally.

1761
02:50:13.20 --> 02:50:21.52
And I would laterally shuffle uphill. So my, my, my prosthetic is the trail leg,

1762
02:50:21.52 --> 02:50:26.80
my sound leg is the uphill leg. And that's essentially just pulling me up. So I'm doing

1763
02:50:26.80 --> 02:50:35.92
this little sidewards lateral gallop up this hill, which just looks crazy. So I finish

1764
02:50:37.92 --> 02:50:42.80
event complete. I'm on the verge of passing out. I'm on the verge of going to see the wizard.

1765
02:50:42.80 --> 02:50:48.16
I'm losing peripheral vision. It's getting real spockly around me. And I'm standing there trying

1766
02:50:48.16 --> 02:50:54.56
to look tough. Like I could do it again if I needed to. And groups see us then comes over and he

1767
02:50:54.56 --> 02:50:59.12
says, Amen, you know, I just took this test yesterday and it kicked my ass. He's like,

1768
02:50:59.68 --> 02:51:05.12
if I wasn't here to witness you just do what you just did, I would never believe that that was

1769
02:51:05.12 --> 02:51:11.84
possible. And this is at the end of 12 weeks. And I'm like, all right, dude, thank you. But like,

1770
02:51:11.84 --> 02:51:16.16
what else do you need from me? You know, which my teammates were kind of laughing. I'm talking to

1771
02:51:16.16 --> 02:51:19.84
the group command, Sajam measure. And I'm like, thanks for the thanks for that. But like, what,

1772
02:51:19.84 --> 02:51:25.36
like, what's next? Come on, man, what else, what else is it going to take? He looks over the group

1773
02:51:25.36 --> 02:51:30.96
commander. And he just goes, Hey, Mark, this is your decision. But I don't know how we're going

1774
02:51:30.96 --> 02:51:37.12
to tell this dude no, after what we just put him through. So he mocked at good look to me. And he

1775
02:51:37.12 --> 02:51:43.60
goes, All right, man, you'll have your orders come Monday, and you'll be back back on the team.

1776
02:51:46.88 --> 02:51:50.48
You have a section here in the book, you got a few sections like this in the book where you

1777
02:51:50.48 --> 02:51:57.60
where you have other people that knew you or that know you chime in. You got a section here about

1778
02:51:57.60 --> 02:52:04.56
this. This is by a master Sergeant Jimmy Rooney. And he writes, the ORT is an extremely difficult

1779
02:52:04.56 --> 02:52:10.000
assessment even for able bodied men. Some events are arguably, arguably impossible for an above the

1780
02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:15.60
knee amputee such as the depth drop. In this event, an individual must climb up a four foot

1781
02:52:15.60 --> 02:52:20.72
platform wearing 50 pound weighted vest, jump off, make an athletic landing without touching the

1782
02:52:20.72 --> 02:52:27.04
ground with his hands. Nick's mechanical knee was incapable of articulating in a dynamic fashion,

1783
02:52:27.04 --> 02:52:31.84
and prevented him from sticking the landing. For weeks, Nick drilled this event starting on one

1784
02:52:31.84 --> 02:52:36.72
foot platform with no additional weight and gradually increasing height and weight over time.

1785
02:52:36.72 --> 02:52:41.84
The method he developed to complete this event was to land in a pistol squat position,

1786
02:52:41.84 --> 02:52:47.76
essentially a single leg squat landing. The guys and I watched him practices over and over again.

1787
02:52:47.76 --> 02:52:51.92
The mere thought of doing this myself made my knees and hips hurt. But Nick insisted it was

1788
02:52:51.92 --> 02:52:55.92
possible he meticulously measured out the distance from the platform to where his heel needed to

1789
02:52:55.92 --> 02:53:00.64
land marking it with tape on the ground too far forward, you'd fall backward upon landing too

1790
02:53:00.64 --> 02:53:05.12
close to the platform and his knee may explode. He approached this event like a science experiment,

1791
02:53:05.12 --> 02:53:09.52
a problem that needed to be solved through trial, error, and work. On the day of Nick's

1792
02:53:09.52 --> 02:53:14.24
final physical assessment, the ORT felt as if the entire unit was present. Nick was attempting to

1793
02:53:14.24 --> 02:53:21.28
make history as the first above the knee amputee to return not just to an ODA, but to an ODA set

1794
02:53:21.28 --> 02:53:27.60
once again to deploy to Afghanistan to conduct combat operations. Everybody was in all watching

1795
02:53:27.60 --> 02:53:32.40
him perform. When he completed the last event with our entire command and attendance, he was

1796
02:53:32.40 --> 02:53:36.64
given approval to return to the team. It was one of the most memorable moments we shared.

1797
02:53:37.44 --> 02:53:43.76
So how did Nick put his mind and body in such a positive, motivated, and influential place to

1798
02:53:43.76 --> 02:53:49.28
become so well known as not only one of the most aggressive warriors, but also a life coach, teacher,

1799
02:53:49.28 --> 02:53:55.12
and mentor, I believe Nick's outlook on his environment is where it started. He had to determine

1800
02:53:55.12 --> 02:54:01.52
what it was that he wanted in life and set a plan to achieve it. Nick could have easily become negative

1801
02:54:01.52 --> 02:54:05.68
and bitter and could have medically retired out of the military. Nobody would have fought less

1802
02:54:05.68 --> 02:54:13.84
of him for doing so. He had been through a lot. Instead, Nick chose to pursue what he identified

1803
02:54:13.84 --> 02:54:19.12
as his purpose. I feel the key to Nick's success is that he clearly stated his intent and it gave

1804
02:54:19.12 --> 02:54:24.80
him a reason to get out of bed every morning. This only grew as he continued achieving goals

1805
02:54:24.80 --> 02:54:30.56
along the way. And Nick may not realize it, but he became a model for success in every aspect

1806
02:54:30.56 --> 02:54:36.88
of being a phenomenal green beret and leader. His fear, his sphere of positive influence encapsulate

1807
02:54:36.88 --> 02:54:42.80
encapsulates everybody he comes in contact with. Complaining around Nick is impossible.

1808
02:54:42.80 --> 02:54:49.28
Giving anything less than 100% around Nick is not an option. His actions raise the bar for the rest

1809
02:54:49.28 --> 02:54:55.52
of us to match. His presence makes us better. What did Nick do to get where he is today?

1810
02:54:55.52 --> 02:55:02.000
Plain and simple. Nick embodies intestinal fortitude and cares about the men and the mission.

1811
02:55:07.44 --> 02:55:16.40
Hell yeah. Freakin insane, right? Jumping off the four foot thing, landing on one leg. Come on,

1812
02:55:16.40 --> 02:55:23.92
man. That's freaking savage. What was your mock max squat when you had two legs? Do you know?

1813
02:55:25.60 --> 02:55:31.68
Back in my, when I was like big, big, before I came into the military, I was around, I was in the

1814
02:55:31.68 --> 02:55:40.08
600s. What do you think your one leg, like, is it stronger now than it was then? My one leg?

1815
02:55:40.08 --> 02:55:45.52
Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. That thing is just like a freaking savage. Yeah. That's the most savage leg

1816
02:55:45.52 --> 02:55:57.84
on the planet. It has to be. It has to be. So, you know, there's, there's, there's one more thing

1817
02:55:57.84 --> 02:56:03.20
I want to read about this before we get into some of your other, you know, moving on from here.

1818
02:56:06.40 --> 02:56:10.96
It just going back, it's a little reflection on the whole scenario, but I think it's an important

1819
02:56:10.96 --> 02:56:17.60
thing to read. You say on March 11, 2013, we were set to conduct a routine operation. As always,

1820
02:56:17.60 --> 02:56:22.32
our partner force gathered outside our camp, the leadership entered a wire to receive the mission

1821
02:56:22.32 --> 02:56:27.20
brief. Only this time a truck also drove in. I noticed immediately that it wasn't right.

1822
02:56:27.20 --> 02:56:32.32
I was pissed. Do I address this now? I thought to myself, it seems obvious that the answer

1823
02:56:32.32 --> 02:56:38.000
was emphatically in the affirmative. Why wouldn't I? The answer to that question is rapport.

1824
02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.72
This is a tough balance and arguably the most critical factor for an ODA's success.

1825
02:56:42.72 --> 02:56:48.32
Fostering and maintaining relationships are the keys when conducting partnered operations.

1826
02:56:48.32 --> 02:56:54.24
I decided to hold off. I would address this with my detachment commander after and he would address

1827
02:56:54.24 --> 02:57:00.24
it with the partner force leadership. This was a decision I must live with for the rest of my life.

1828
02:57:01.12 --> 02:57:06.40
This truck was a Ford Ranger with a mounted PKM in the bed. This is the weapon that would

1829
02:57:06.40 --> 02:57:11.76
happen that would moments later rip my body to shreds drastically altering the rest of my life.

1830
02:57:11.76 --> 02:57:20.56
But this result is not the reason for my regret. The loss of my leg is not why I spring up sweating

1831
02:57:20.56 --> 02:57:25.76
in the middle of the night. Living the rest of my life as an amputee is not why I continue to

1832
02:57:25.76 --> 02:57:33.84
reanalyze my decision making process on that day. Our detachment commander, Captain Andrew

1833
02:57:33.84 --> 02:57:41.52
Peterson, Keele, our infantry uplift squad leader, Staff Sergeant Rex Shad, and our military working

1834
02:57:41.52 --> 02:57:46.88
dog, Back, were all killed in action as a result of my decision.

1835
02:57:49.76 --> 02:57:55.28
It took years to be able to look at this event and extract positive value. The pain was too great.

1836
02:57:56.48 --> 02:58:02.24
I couldn't see past my anger and the disappointment with myself. I couldn't see past the faces of

1837
02:58:02.24 --> 02:58:09.44
my brothers who paid the ultimate sacrifice. It took time. It took a lot of reflection.

1838
02:58:10.64 --> 02:58:15.12
It was hard, but I owed them this effort so their deaths were not for nothing.

1839
02:58:17.44 --> 02:58:24.32
Gradually, I was able to gather the lessons learned. Internal security, SOPs,

1840
02:58:24.32 --> 02:58:31.28
partner force relationship dynamics, and John Boyd's Oodaloop cycle are just a few examples of

1841
02:58:31.28 --> 02:58:36.88
what was extracted. We used our experience to better educate ourselves and those around us

1842
02:58:36.88 --> 02:58:41.12
in order to minimize the likelihood of a future similar tragedy.

1843
02:58:42.88 --> 02:58:46.40
The loss of these men brought value to those who remain in the fight.

1844
02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:52.64
How many lives have been saved because of their sacrifice? There's no way to ever know,

1845
02:58:52.64 --> 02:59:00.48
but I'm certain it is substantial. The insider attack on March 11th, 2013 is considered to this

1846
02:59:00.48 --> 02:59:05.68
day the most catastrophic insider attack since the start of the global war on terrorism.

1847
02:59:06.72 --> 02:59:10.40
It is referenced in schools and training events throughout the soft community.

1848
02:59:11.76 --> 02:59:17.20
As painful as it remains, we have managed to pull the positive value from this tragedy.

1849
02:59:18.08 --> 02:59:22.16
We must get better. We owe this to the fallen.

1850
02:59:22.16 --> 02:59:36.24
Yeah, you and I were talking when we weren't recording.

1851
02:59:38.80 --> 02:59:44.80
For me, I had a blue on blue incident in Ramadi that I was in charge of. A friendly Iraqi soldier

1852
02:59:44.80 --> 02:59:54.64
was killed several more were wounded. One of my guys was wounded. What I did when I got home was

1853
02:59:55.20 --> 03:00:01.12
debrief that event to every SEAL team on the West Coast that was going on deployment.

1854
03:00:02.96 --> 03:00:10.32
I had many times guys come back and say, hey, I was in the situation. We had this element over

1855
03:00:10.32 --> 03:00:16.80
here, that element over here. If I wouldn't have known and trained to avoid blue on blues,

1856
03:00:16.80 --> 03:00:23.04
the 100% would have happened. I was just saying to you that you're telling this story.

1857
03:00:24.40 --> 03:00:30.96
Look, man, there's special operations guys working around the world right now as we speak with

1858
03:00:30.96 --> 03:00:40.88
countless partner forces all over the place. This is a lesson that everybody will not forget.

1859
03:00:42.56 --> 03:00:47.68
I know that the blue on blue that we had early in deployment saved lives later in deployment

1860
03:00:47.68 --> 03:00:53.20
because we would have had, there's other things. I talk about an extreme ownership.

1861
03:00:53.20 --> 03:01:01.28
I had a freaking Bradley want to put 25 millimeter chain gun on what they thought was enemy

1862
03:01:02.88 --> 03:01:05.92
element on a rooftop. That enemy element was actually my guys.

1863
03:01:08.16 --> 03:01:14.000
Laef talks about in there, he had Chris Kyle identify, hey, there's, I see a person with a

1864
03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.88
scope weapon in this building. Do you want me to shoot him? Laef's checking with the army.

1865
03:01:18.88 --> 03:01:23.20
Do you guys have anyone in this building? And they're like, no, kill that sniper. And Chris didn't

1866
03:01:23.20 --> 03:01:29.04
feel comfortable taking the shot and didn't take it. And luckily he didn't because we were so sensitive

1867
03:01:29.04 --> 03:01:37.44
to blue on blue. And so the lessons coming away from this guaranteed. You say you don't know how

1868
03:01:37.44 --> 03:01:41.52
many lives they've saved and we'll never be able to know how many lives they've saved, but no doubt

1869
03:01:42.08 --> 03:01:46.72
the level of caution and making sure that assessment is happening all the time.

1870
03:01:46.72 --> 03:01:50.40
That's what we got to take away from these things for sure. I have to.

1871
03:01:56.72 --> 03:02:03.36
You know, another thing that I breezed over a little bit is the fact that as you

1872
03:02:04.64 --> 03:02:10.64
are focused on you and you're focused on your goal of like, hey, I'm going to get back to an ODA

1873
03:02:10.64 --> 03:02:19.36
team at some point along that journey before you took that final physical test, you looked in the

1874
03:02:19.36 --> 03:02:26.000
mirror and thought to yourself, wait a second, this isn't about me. And you know, you're going over,

1875
03:02:27.76 --> 03:02:34.000
if you can't do your job, it's not just about you. It's about the guys you might let down.

1876
03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:39.12
It's about do they want me on the team? Do they want, do they feel like there's going to be slacked

1877
03:02:39.12 --> 03:02:45.84
that they're going to have to pick up for me? Talk about that kind of, you had some legit

1878
03:02:45.84 --> 03:02:51.12
heart to heart conversations with the guys that you would be working with about the situation

1879
03:02:51.12 --> 03:02:55.52
that you were in and whether you should proceed down that path because it wasn't just about you.

1880
03:02:55.52 --> 03:02:59.84
You got 11 other guys that are counting on you to be able to carry the weight.

1881
03:03:00.88 --> 03:03:08.16
Yeah, and not just the 11, but the families as well. And you're right. I was in a tunnel,

1882
03:03:08.16 --> 03:03:16.72
my tunnel vision during that first phase about it was about me being successful, doing what I

1883
03:03:16.72 --> 03:03:21.36
knew I needed to do, proving that they say is wrong, proving myself right, all that kind of stuff.

1884
03:03:21.36 --> 03:03:28.64
It was about me. And once I began going through this assessment, I'm knocking one out after

1885
03:03:28.64 --> 03:03:35.44
another, boom, boom, boom. Right around that time, I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic

1886
03:03:35.44 --> 03:03:40.96
because I realized in that moment that I was going back to a team and I hadn't thought about them

1887
03:03:40.96 --> 03:03:46.000
once before. And these are guys that are around me. They're in the gym, we're training together.

1888
03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:50.80
I'm seeing them all the time, but I was so target fixated on me doing what I needed to do that I

1889
03:03:50.80 --> 03:03:59.12
didn't consider them. And it's just, it scared the hell out of me. So that very, that day at work,

1890
03:03:59.12 --> 03:04:05.28
I tracked down a couple of the guys that were local, had some phone conversations with some guys that

1891
03:04:05.28 --> 03:04:11.36
were off site doing some stuff. And I was like, guys, I apologize for having not even done this

1892
03:04:11.36 --> 03:04:16.80
up until this point, but is this within the best interest of the team? You guys are supportive

1893
03:04:16.80 --> 03:04:22.000
and you're in my corner, but are you doing that just because you care about me and you want me

1894
03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:28.64
to be happy? Have you guys thought about this? Because I haven't. And I don't think I can do

1895
03:04:28.64 --> 03:04:33.84
this. I don't think I can give this an objective look because I'm so obsessed with success. I need

1896
03:04:33.84 --> 03:04:40.72
you guys there to do that. And this was maybe four or five different conversations. And I got pretty

1897
03:04:40.72 --> 03:04:45.68
much the same answer from all of them. And they said, listen, dude, we've all talked about this

1898
03:04:45.68 --> 03:04:52.40
already amongst ourselves. And the, the high truth is, is we don't know if this is going to work.

1899
03:04:52.40 --> 03:05:00.40
But what I can promise you is we want you to keep working towards it. We will be the ones to tell you

1900
03:05:00.40 --> 03:05:06.000
if this isn't going to work. If you're able to make it back, we'll assess the situation then.

1901
03:05:07.28 --> 03:05:12.88
And we'll make that hard call for you so you don't have to. So I had to put my trust into them and

1902
03:05:12.88 --> 03:05:19.12
my teammates to be able to look at it objectively that way. And Jimmy Rooney, who you just read about,

1903
03:05:19.12 --> 03:05:25.84
he was set to take the team as the team sergeant. He may have already taken it at that point,

1904
03:05:25.84 --> 03:05:30.48
but he and I were working together when I was working as an instructor. He was the head instructor

1905
03:05:30.48 --> 03:05:36.40
of our safari committee, Special Forces Advanced Urban Combat Committee. And we work at our offices

1906
03:05:36.40 --> 03:05:40.56
right down the hall. We worked together, that committee and the combatives committee. So we had

1907
03:05:40.56 --> 03:05:46.000
a working relationship. And it wasn't till much farther down the road that he told me he was going

1908
03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:54.96
to take 2-6, take my team. And he was the last one I talked to on that day at work. And we had a

1909
03:05:54.96 --> 03:06:02.24
candid emotional conversation. And he said the same thing. And hearing it from him as the guy that I

1910
03:06:02.24 --> 03:06:07.12
know is going to put the best interest of the team above all else, because that's his job,

1911
03:06:07.12 --> 03:06:16.32
I can trust him and the guys to give me that no shit objective feedback. So once I made that switch

1912
03:06:17.20 --> 03:06:22.96
about wanting to pursue my own goal versus, and the reason behind that,

1913
03:06:24.64 --> 03:06:31.20
to it being about them. And when I'm walking into my fourth training session for the day and I'm

1914
03:06:31.20 --> 03:06:37.52
exhausted and tired and beat up, rather than thinking about taking those first steps off the

1915
03:06:37.52 --> 03:06:42.32
plane in Afghanistan with my arms raised in the year, I was thinking about my teammate's son,

1916
03:06:42.32 --> 03:06:47.20
I was thinking about my teammate's wife. And I needed to annihilate this workout right now.

1917
03:06:47.20 --> 03:06:54.88
There's no other option for them, for that kid or for that woman. And it took what was already

1918
03:06:54.88 --> 03:07:05.12
an extraordinarily intense and rigid lifestyle to another level. And you could, I could even feel

1919
03:07:05.12 --> 03:07:09.92
the additional energy surging through me. It was like electric. And now I'm walking into these

1920
03:07:09.92 --> 03:07:13.44
training sessions, it was just that much easier to get up at zero three, it was just that much

1921
03:07:13.44 --> 03:07:18.08
easier to do those extra two, three reps, when everything in my body and my mind is telling me

1922
03:07:18.08 --> 03:07:22.88
to stop. The image of my teammates five year old is what fueled that.

1923
03:07:22.88 --> 03:07:32.56
Five year old is what fueled that to happen. Freaking, I guess we get some of that beat into

1924
03:07:32.56 --> 03:07:38.96
us, you know, like you do, you just never want to let down your friends. And then you throw the

1925
03:07:38.96 --> 03:07:49.52
family on top of that. Yeah, that's heavy. And you make it back, you make it back to a team,

1926
03:07:49.52 --> 03:07:57.68
you end up going back to Afghanistan. And it's August to fight and season taught.

1927
03:07:58.64 --> 03:08:02.96
What do you think when you show up there, man? There was a, you know, there was a, there was a

1928
03:08:02.96 --> 03:08:08.56
quick, you know, celebration that I had just with myself. The boy collectively, we were,

1929
03:08:08.56 --> 03:08:12.80
it was all business, but I did have that, that glorifying moment that I dreamed of

1930
03:08:12.80 --> 03:08:17.12
taking the steps off the plane. That was real short lived because I realized how fast

1931
03:08:17.12 --> 03:08:30.08
we were in the game and how many gaps I had. So we landed, this is 2015, we landed C17 lands,

1932
03:08:30.08 --> 03:08:38.24
it's taxing, it stops. The tailgate hasn't even dropped yet. And the SOTIF command team is running

1933
03:08:38.24 --> 03:08:44.64
onto the plane, which is unusual. And they run over to our team leadership and they have a little

1934
03:08:44.64 --> 03:08:49.76
huddle on the plane. So we're all looking around. We had a horrible infill. I mean, we went through

1935
03:08:49.76 --> 03:08:54.32
like five different countries, delays and flights. It was a mess. It took us like a week to get in.

1936
03:08:54.32 --> 03:09:00.64
So we're all operating on random time zone times coming off of ambient, you know, half a sleep,

1937
03:09:00.64 --> 03:09:05.04
like, okay, we finally made it. And this, this meeting is happening on the plane.

1938
03:09:06.88 --> 03:09:10.40
We get the equipment off and our team leadership is like, we need to go into the,

1939
03:09:10.40 --> 03:09:16.08
into the meeting and briefing room like now, we go in there. And there was a 19th group team.

1940
03:09:16.64 --> 03:09:24.32
So Army Special Forces National Guard team that was operating down in Helmand that had a real bad

1941
03:09:24.32 --> 03:09:28.88
situation going on with their partner force, like we use the term catastrophic loss of rapport

1942
03:09:29.44 --> 03:09:33.60
as being like mission abort, because we worked through partner force, they were right at that

1943
03:09:33.60 --> 03:09:38.72
point where the machine gun barrels were essentially being pointed inwards with the

1944
03:09:38.72 --> 03:09:44.88
commando elements they were working with. It was, it was, it was horrible. So we needed to get spun

1945
03:09:44.88 --> 03:09:50.32
up. Even though on that trip, we weren't falling directly under the sodiff. We were falling under

1946
03:09:50.32 --> 03:09:57.84
a separate task force for that deployment. Task force gave us over to the sodiff to be the answer

1947
03:09:57.84 --> 03:10:03.92
to this problem as like a temporary solution. So we were getting spun up the second we literally

1948
03:10:03.92 --> 03:10:10.88
the second we landed and it was, it was game time. So did you guys go take over for them?

1949
03:10:11.44 --> 03:10:18.56
We didn't take over, but we went down there and assisted them to get the situation under control

1950
03:10:19.20 --> 03:10:23.28
for a couple of weeks. When you look at that from a leadership perspective, what was wrong?

1951
03:10:26.08 --> 03:10:30.000
I'm going to piss off a lot of national God guys on this, but this is my opinion is

1952
03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:36.80
national God SF teams provide an enormous value across the operational continuum,

1953
03:10:37.60 --> 03:10:43.20
where I've seen it work. The best is when they take national God SF guys and they attach them to

1954
03:10:43.20 --> 03:10:50.72
active duty ODAs. In 2012-13, we had a national God medic that was attached to us for that duration

1955
03:10:50.72 --> 03:10:58.000
of that deployment. That always works out great. When you have an, an organic national God ODA

1956
03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:04.08
and you put them into a combat environment, this is, I'm generally speaking, they just don't

1957
03:11:04.80 --> 03:11:10.000
have the time that they train together to the same level that we do as in the active side

1958
03:11:11.68 --> 03:11:17.68
to bring that same level of tactical capability to a fight. And they're hamstrung oftentimes

1959
03:11:17.68 --> 03:11:24.08
because they group these teams together kind of as of a hodgepodge of different dudes in the unit

1960
03:11:24.08 --> 03:11:30.80
to send them over. So you don't have that organic chemistry that you have with an active duty side.

1961
03:11:32.08 --> 03:11:37.20
So from just a management and operational perspective, they're fighting upstream because

1962
03:11:37.20 --> 03:11:43.92
of that dynamic. And when you put them into a hostile environment, like in Helmand, and you're

1963
03:11:43.92 --> 03:11:50.96
given that type of mission, it can be, it can be really tough. It can be hard for anybody. And if

1964
03:11:50.96 --> 03:11:58.16
you haven't done a good work up together, it's going to be even harder. Yeah. You also, you know,

1965
03:11:58.16 --> 03:12:03.84
you get over there and there's like new challenges for you. One of them you talk about is getting in

1966
03:12:03.84 --> 03:12:08.96
and out of an MRAP. And you go through this whole thing, you're like, if you don't know what an MRAP

1967
03:12:08.96 --> 03:12:12.96
is, it's a, it's a mind resistant vehicle, but they're freaking tall because they want them off

1968
03:12:12.96 --> 03:12:18.32
the ground as high as they can be so that the, the explosion, if it's underneath it, dissipates.

1969
03:12:18.32 --> 03:12:22.08
So they're, they're, you're climbing a ladder to get in there. You say, I can recall one of the

1970
03:12:22.08 --> 03:12:27.76
most frustrating tax was getting into and out of a mind resistant ambush protected all terrain vehicle.

1971
03:12:28.56 --> 03:12:32.56
To get in and out of these trucks, one must climb up four feet with the use of a couple

1972
03:12:32.56 --> 03:12:37.68
metal steps. As with most military vehicles, the MATV is designed for function, not comfort or

1973
03:12:37.68 --> 03:12:42.24
accessibility. Of course, getting into and out of one of these was simple as a two legged dude.

1974
03:12:42.24 --> 03:12:47.36
But in 2015, it was anything but to say this was frustrating would have been an understatement.

1975
03:12:47.36 --> 03:12:51.68
This was also something I did not even consider during my train up to get back onto a team,

1976
03:12:51.68 --> 03:12:56.000
but it was a challenge nonetheless. I began drilling over and over again, in and out,

1977
03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:00.88
trying different foot placements, trying different hand placements, how I shifted my weight.

1978
03:13:00.88 --> 03:13:06.24
Then I did the same with kid on then with a rifle over and over and over again. I had a teammate

1979
03:13:06.24 --> 03:13:10.96
videotape my reps so I could watch the tape and check for deficiencies or wasted movement.

1980
03:13:11.52 --> 03:13:15.84
I had put the, I had them put me on a stopwatch over and over. I checked my time against one of

1981
03:13:15.84 --> 03:13:20.80
my teammates to compare. I focused solely on the task at hand. I wasn't thinking about all the other

1982
03:13:20.80 --> 03:13:26.08
tasks I needed to master and I certainly wasn't thinking about the bridge, just this one piece

1983
03:13:26.08 --> 03:13:32.24
of the puzzle, focus rep after rep until I felt I was sufficient. I repeated this process throughout

1984
03:13:32.24 --> 03:13:37.04
the entire deployment, even after I displayed enough capability to my leadership where they felt

1985
03:13:37.04 --> 03:13:42.64
confident, confident putting me on more and more operations. That's like one little thing,

1986
03:13:42.64 --> 03:13:48.000
which no one would think about and it's a freaking challenge for you and you had to figure how to

1987
03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:53.28
do it. Yeah, because by the time I got to the team, man, they were already past their collective

1988
03:13:53.28 --> 03:13:57.84
training phase. They'd already finished PMT. They were basically just getting gear prep,

1989
03:13:57.84 --> 03:14:03.60
taking some leave and then heading into the box. So I had just like six weeks on the team before

1990
03:14:03.60 --> 03:14:07.60
we were back in Afghanistan. So these tactical tasks, you know, they would have been fleshed

1991
03:14:07.60 --> 03:14:12.48
out and trained in if I was with the guys leading up. I didn't have that time. So things

1992
03:14:12.48 --> 03:14:17.68
became real on the ground the first time I tried to climb into a mad V or an MRAP and I'm like,

1993
03:14:17.68 --> 03:14:25.76
how the hell do I even do this? So that's just an example and it's a list of tasks that I perform

1994
03:14:25.76 --> 03:14:31.12
the same way and I, you know, downtime in between training and ops, I would just identify one of

1995
03:14:31.12 --> 03:14:35.76
these things that I knew needed work and I would just like go crazy and just do it a thousand times.

1996
03:14:36.88 --> 03:14:41.12
If I do this a thousand times, I'm going to figure out how to do it. If I do it a thousand times,

1997
03:14:41.12 --> 03:14:44.80
I'm going to find a way to do it. I just need to do it a thousand times. So like, how do I do that?

1998
03:14:44.80 --> 03:14:49.44
I'll do it a hundred times a day, you know, for a hundred days or whatever, 10 days. And what was

1999
03:14:49.44 --> 03:14:53.60
your, what was your mission on this deployment? What were you guys doing? So we were running the

2000
03:14:53.60 --> 03:15:02.40
Kotejas, which is an Afghan commando unit. That's their tier one unit that was established by CAG

2001
03:15:02.40 --> 03:15:10.80
years prior that they handed off to us to run. So that's their premier direct action CT force.

2002
03:15:10.80 --> 03:15:17.20
So we were running those guys based primarily up out of the Kabul area, not Kabul,

2003
03:15:17.20 --> 03:15:23.28
Propa, but in that vicinity. So we had, we moved around the, basically the entire AO.

2004
03:15:23.28 --> 03:15:27.68
And just running DA's mostly? Yeah. What was your op tempo like?

2005
03:15:28.40 --> 03:15:35.36
It wasn't as busy as, as the deployment I had prior because they were just more specific point

2006
03:15:35.36 --> 03:15:40.08
target rates based on higher levels of Intel and higher levels of effects. Whereas on the

2007
03:15:40.08 --> 03:15:44.72
ground prior, we were just like going out and like paving the road a lot of the way. So this was

2008
03:15:44.72 --> 03:15:51.28
more tied to like strategic initiatives and directions. So we'd maybe have a thing maybe once

2009
03:15:51.28 --> 03:15:56.16
a week, once every couple of weeks. But in that time, there were a couple of massive ops that we

2010
03:15:56.16 --> 03:16:04.08
were a part of that took up good chunks of time. One of that was, was when Kendoos, the Taliban

2011
03:16:04.08 --> 03:16:12.48
took it over. We were a part of that as well. So we ended up shifting to that AO and we dedicated

2012
03:16:12.48 --> 03:16:17.92
like two, three months to the response to that and then to the rebuild of that AO.

2013
03:16:18.72 --> 03:16:21.04
How many guys were in that force you were working with?

2014
03:16:22.24 --> 03:16:28.56
We had around a company size element, about a hundred, 110 dudes. And the craziest thing about

2015
03:16:28.56 --> 03:16:33.52
working with these guys. So these guys were built, you know, by by Kegi as prior, they had all,

2016
03:16:33.52 --> 03:16:39.76
like all the equipment, they had all the Gucci stuff, same uniforms. They're rocking PBS 31s.

2017
03:16:39.76 --> 03:16:44.96
Like they got like high speed stuff and they're all juiced up. Like they're like,

2018
03:16:45.60 --> 03:16:51.12
they're pumping like sustenance in there like daily, which you see that right when you meet these

2019
03:16:51.12 --> 03:16:56.64
guys. That's like very strange. It is. Even like the standard Afghan commandos, they aren't that

2020
03:16:56.64 --> 03:17:00.24
outfitted that way. They don't look that way. We meet up with these dudes for the first time and

2021
03:17:00.24 --> 03:17:07.20
they're these just yoked up Afghans rocking cry precision. Like this is weird, but what made it,

2022
03:17:08.56 --> 03:17:14.96
I never got to a point where I was comfortable, was under nods. Everyone looks the exact same.

2023
03:17:15.92 --> 03:17:19.92
Whereas normally I can tell the difference between my teammate and our partner force

2024
03:17:19.92 --> 03:17:25.76
instantaneously. When you got guys that size rocking the same gear we are, I couldn't tell who

2025
03:17:25.76 --> 03:17:30.80
was who. Dang. So we, you know, we had different like mockings that we used as like IR mockings

2026
03:17:30.80 --> 03:17:36.64
to try to help us figure out where we were. But I was constantly uncomfortable when we were doing

2027
03:17:36.64 --> 03:17:41.60
night stuff, which was a good portion of it because I didn't know who was who. Yeah, that's

2028
03:17:41.60 --> 03:17:46.08
not feeling good. No man. I didn't, I didn't like how were they? They were good in the field. They

2029
03:17:46.08 --> 03:17:50.80
were good. Yeah, they were good. They were good. I mean, you know, it's an Afghan partner force,

2030
03:17:50.80 --> 03:17:55.60
but they were, they were the most proficient that I'd ever seen. No, they were good. And so that,

2031
03:17:55.60 --> 03:18:02.40
that deployment pretty straightforward doing a bunch of DA's. Any, any big lessons learned from

2032
03:18:02.40 --> 03:18:08.32
that one? I mean, I was drinking through a fire hose because not only were my Afghanistan for

2033
03:18:08.32 --> 03:18:13.12
the first time as an amputee, I'm dealing with all these tactical gaps. We were living out of

2034
03:18:13.12 --> 03:18:19.20
rucksacks most of that trip. So I didn't get a chance to really establish like a rhythm in one

2035
03:18:19.20 --> 03:18:26.24
location at one time because we were moving around so much. So I had to adapt my loadout package

2036
03:18:26.88 --> 03:18:32.72
for vehicles for half infill ops for dismounted ops, like where do I keep my extra legs? Where do

2037
03:18:32.72 --> 03:18:37.20
I keep all my equipment? How do I carry all this stuff that I'm going to need if and when something

2038
03:18:37.20 --> 03:18:46.56
breaks down? It was a forcing function to think about how I would go about doing that. So for every

2039
03:18:46.56 --> 03:18:54.08
deployment I've had since, it's pales in comparison because I jumped off like the massive cliff to

2040
03:18:54.08 --> 03:18:58.40
begin with. So now if I go someplace and I'm working out of the same location, it's like

2041
03:18:59.28 --> 03:19:04.08
quite simple comparably. Why do you gotta bring an extra leg? Like what scenario? Are you bringing

2042
03:19:04.08 --> 03:19:10.24
an extra leg in the field? All the time. At least one. I mean, the technology in this thing is great,

2043
03:19:10.24 --> 03:19:16.000
but it breaks. Like legs, legs break. You know, this thing's got a little microprocessor in it.

2044
03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:21.76
You got batteries? It's got an internal battery. Yeah. There's a little computer inside this knee,

2045
03:19:21.76 --> 03:19:26.48
so I have to charge it and then it runs like a computer. It doesn't power me. How long does

2046
03:19:26.48 --> 03:19:30.32
the charge last for? It depends on the level of activity because it goes into like a hibernation

2047
03:19:30.32 --> 03:19:35.28
mode, like a computer. Like right now it's like sleeping. So depending on how much I'm moving

2048
03:19:35.28 --> 03:19:41.76
will determine how much battery life I have, but even on an active schedule, a fully charged knee

2049
03:19:41.76 --> 03:19:47.76
will get me like three days. Okay. And so you're bringing a whole extra leg in the field? At least

2050
03:19:47.76 --> 03:19:54.24
one. Yeah. Sometimes more than one? Yeah. So I'd usually carry one mechanical backup knee on my

2051
03:19:54.24 --> 03:19:59.52
person in my rock and then I'd have a backup one of these. How much is that way? The mechanical ones

2052
03:19:59.52 --> 03:20:05.04
are a lot lighter because there's no technology built into it. Mechanical knee maybe, you know,

2053
03:20:05.04 --> 03:20:09.60
eight pounds, nine pounds. This one weighs closer than that. Freaking nine pounds is a lot when

2054
03:20:09.60 --> 03:20:17.04
you're humping around, bro. That's not fun. No, I'd rather not have to carry it, but I've broken

2055
03:20:17.04 --> 03:20:22.80
so many of these things that it's really, I consider a requirement. So my standard loadout

2056
03:20:22.80 --> 03:20:29.52
for like a vehicle type movement, a gaff would be mechanical leg in my ruck, an extra one of these

2057
03:20:29.52 --> 03:20:34.96
that I'm wearing now in my truck and an extra one of these in another truck. Okay. So my truck was

2058
03:20:34.96 --> 03:20:41.76
disabled or blown up. I'd have another leg somewhere to go get and put on. You know, it kind of sounds

2059
03:20:41.76 --> 03:20:47.76
like a pain in the ass, but it's also like, Hey, if you got shot and you're freaking prosthetic,

2060
03:20:47.76 --> 03:20:51.20
you're like, cool, let me just put on the other one. Well, it's fun. You mentioned one of the

2061
03:20:51.20 --> 03:20:56.32
conversations I had with my group command team. They were voicing their concerns. They're like,

2062
03:20:56.32 --> 03:21:01.12
well, what happens if your prosthetic breaks in the field? And I said, well, I have, I can carry

2063
03:21:01.12 --> 03:21:06.24
an extra one. If your leg breaks in the field, you're out. And they kind of got a chuckle out of

2064
03:21:06.24 --> 03:21:14.48
that. But that's true. So you got good, you got proficient and have a good solid deployment.

2065
03:21:15.28 --> 03:21:20.56
Yeah, successful. And we had a lot of visibility on us that whole trip. I mean, all the way up to

2066
03:21:20.56 --> 03:21:26.000
like Washington, because I needed approval from the use of SOC commander to be able to go.

2067
03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:32.80
So the SOCOM commander was aware of it. So no SF team, no soft team wants a lot of people

2068
03:21:33.60 --> 03:21:38.24
checking it, checking in on them and paying attention to what they're doing and answering

2069
03:21:38.24 --> 03:21:45.20
phone calls from, you know, three style generals, no ODA or team leadership wants that. My team

2070
03:21:45.20 --> 03:21:50.08
leadership dealt with a bunch of that because it was almost like people were expecting and waiting

2071
03:21:50.08 --> 03:21:54.64
for something to go wrong for them to pull me out and be like, Hey, we tried it. It didn't work.

2072
03:21:54.64 --> 03:22:00.08
Let's like get back to reality here. And like, let's find a real solution for this dude.

2073
03:22:01.04 --> 03:22:08.64
But that didn't happen. We had a successful trip. No, no issues. So it was just, it was just hectic

2074
03:22:08.64 --> 03:22:13.68
because I was doing this vehicle type thing in all my free time. So after that six month pump,

2075
03:22:14.48 --> 03:22:17.36
I was the most tired I've ever been in my life.

2076
03:22:18.64 --> 03:22:23.12
What's the, I know you wrote about how there's like a limit to the amount of time you can spend

2077
03:22:23.12 --> 03:22:28.96
on it. Well, how long can you patrol for? Like a foot patrol? So I've done, you know, multi-day

2078
03:22:29.76 --> 03:22:35.84
missions. It just, you know, it does start to take its toll after a while because there'll

2079
03:22:35.84 --> 03:22:40.16
be a point where I have to take it off at a minimum, you know, wipe down the sweat, maybe throw on

2080
03:22:40.16 --> 03:22:48.32
some antiperspirant type stuff, get it back on and go. So it just depends on those different

2081
03:22:48.32 --> 03:22:53.52
variables. But there were times when, you know, I'd be in the field out on something for four, five days.

2082
03:22:53.52 --> 03:22:57.12
And as long as I had, you know, a couple, two, three hours during my rest cycle,

2083
03:22:57.12 --> 03:23:01.44
to kind of let that fluid go back into the residual limb and kind of plump back up,

2084
03:23:02.56 --> 03:23:07.60
strap it back on and, and then be good. Yeah. Well, being in the field for a few days, it's freaking

2085
03:23:07.60 --> 03:23:15.36
legit. That's awesome. Did you come home from that deployment and what, but go again? That's the deal?

2086
03:23:15.36 --> 03:23:20.56
Yeah, back from that trip. Standard training cycle for us, individual schools, collective training

2087
03:23:21.52 --> 03:23:27.04
into PMT. And then the next year, the year after that trip, we were over in Somalia

2088
03:23:27.04 --> 03:23:34.16
on our next thing, which was a CT mission as well, CTDA mission, just different continent,

2089
03:23:34.16 --> 03:23:38.88
but very, very similar. Doing the same thing. Doing the same thing. Did you have a partner

2090
03:23:38.88 --> 03:23:45.04
force over there? Yeah, we had five. Oh, damn. Yeah. We had a bunch of Somalis. We had some Kenyans.

2091
03:23:45.04 --> 03:23:50.80
We had some Ethiopians. And you're training them and you're going out, did they're doing work?

2092
03:23:50.80 --> 03:23:56.72
You're doing work with them? Yeah. We were, we were, we were targeting Al Shabaab. This is a,

2093
03:23:56.72 --> 03:24:04.72
you know, Al Qaeda affiliate. We were targeting those guys. And it's good op tempo. It was busy.

2094
03:24:04.72 --> 03:24:14.16
We were going out once two, three times a week. We were doing DAs. Yep. Doing DA.

2095
03:24:14.16 --> 03:24:20.72
We were down south. The other unit we were working with was, was further up north. And we

2096
03:24:20.72 --> 03:24:29.04
would just like flip flop to support each other. It was busy. And are you, do you get in a flow now?

2097
03:24:29.04 --> 03:24:31.92
You said like, Hey, once you did that first deployment to Afghanistan, where you're living

2098
03:24:31.92 --> 03:24:36.24
out of a rock, are you in a pretty good flow now where you're, you're starting to be able to deal

2099
03:24:36.24 --> 03:24:42.16
with your leg? It's not that big of a factor. Yeah. So the two years I had, like since Walter Reed,

2100
03:24:42.16 --> 03:24:46.56
you know, the first trip to Afghanistan or the train up Afghanistan, now I'm like two,

2101
03:24:46.56 --> 03:24:53.84
two and a half years post injury. I learned a lot of lessons and ways to maintain my prosthetic and

2102
03:24:53.84 --> 03:24:58.40
my body. So I'm learning how to do this. So by the time 2016 trip came around,

2103
03:24:58.40 --> 03:25:06.24
I was, I was much more confident in my tactical prowess and insertion within operations. Hell yeah.

2104
03:25:06.24 --> 03:25:14.32
And then what's after that Somalia deployment? Another deployment? That was 2016. So I came back

2105
03:25:14.32 --> 03:25:21.36
from that. And that was when I transferred groups from third group to fifth group. The reason I

2106
03:25:21.36 --> 03:25:28.56
transferred because my wife, she went down a different career path and got orders for, for

2107
03:25:28.56 --> 03:25:34.16
Campbell. So I transferred groups at this point we were married. So to stay with her, obviously,

2108
03:25:34.16 --> 03:25:39.12
I transferred from third to fifth, went over there and then got integrated with those guys.

2109
03:25:39.12 --> 03:25:46.96
And then my next trip was into Lebanon. Check. And you're obviously still active duty right now.

2110
03:25:46.96 --> 03:25:52.56
What kind of let that one, we use our imaginations for that deployment over there.

2111
03:25:53.76 --> 03:25:57.12
At what point did you decide you were going to try and get a commission, become a warrant?

2112
03:25:58.24 --> 03:26:02.88
Or what you guys call in the army a chief? Yeah. Yeah. In the Navy. I'm sure you know this. Yeah.

2113
03:26:02.88 --> 03:26:07.04
A chief isn't a listed guy in the Navy. And we still have warrant officer. We have chief warrant

2114
03:26:07.04 --> 03:26:11.92
officers. But what point did you want to become a warrant officer? Yeah, I started looking at it

2115
03:26:11.92 --> 03:26:17.36
actually when I was in Somalia, because I warrant had to go home on emergency leave. And I kind of

2116
03:26:17.36 --> 03:26:25.44
took up a lot of those tasks for the detachment. When I got back from, from Lebanon is when I dropped

2117
03:26:25.44 --> 03:26:32.40
that, is when I dropped that packet and got picked up. Yep. So we, the SF warrant offices,

2118
03:26:33.36 --> 03:26:38.64
we go to Fort Bragg to go to our school, whereas every other Army warrant officer goes down to

2119
03:26:38.64 --> 03:26:43.52
Fort Rucka and goes through the warrant officer course. We have our own, our own program because

2120
03:26:43.52 --> 03:26:49.52
it's the SF warrant officer is wildly different than all the other warrant officer branches.

2121
03:26:50.80 --> 03:26:56.24
You know, there's only two combat warrant officers. And those are aviators and then SF guys,

2122
03:26:56.24 --> 03:27:01.36
the rest, those are, those are managers. Like they, you run a desk, right? Because you're,

2123
03:27:01.36 --> 03:27:05.52
you're an expert in that particular system and your job is to manage and task. On the outside

2124
03:27:05.52 --> 03:27:09.76
of the house, it's, it's different because you're on the team. So we have our own school. So I went

2125
03:27:09.76 --> 03:27:16.40
and did that. That was in 2019. Yeah, five months, my five month course, it's a lot of writing and

2126
03:27:16.96 --> 03:27:20.16
briefing and officer and stuff. And you loved every second.

2127
03:27:20.96 --> 03:27:27.20
Dude, salute to the Army and the special operations for this whole thing. Just for them,

2128
03:27:27.76 --> 03:27:32.000
keeping you on that path, opening those things up, you become a warrant officer, like that's freaking

2129
03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:37.28
just outstanding that they, that this happened. You know, I mean, look, this stuff could be easily

2130
03:27:37.28 --> 03:27:41.84
be shut down. Like there could be some, some senior officer that's like, I don't think this is the

2131
03:27:41.84 --> 03:27:47.68
right thing to do. And boom, you know, so that's outstanding that you actually, that the army

2132
03:27:47.68 --> 03:27:53.12
allowed this to happen. Do I believe it should? Hell yeah, of course. But I'm saying, man, you know,

2133
03:27:53.12 --> 03:27:57.44
some of these, some of these bureaucrats, like they don't think that way. They don't think like

2134
03:27:57.44 --> 03:28:04.24
you think they don't think like I think so salute to the army and to SF for, for keeping that door

2135
03:28:04.24 --> 03:28:10.56
open. Freakin that's just outstanding. I know I had one of my guys was Ryan Job was blind,

2136
03:28:10.56 --> 03:28:17.68
he's blinded. And you know, I talked to the admiral and I was like, Hey, sir, he, he wants to stay in

2137
03:28:17.68 --> 03:28:22.56
and the animals like whatever he wants, wants to stand. We got jobs for him. That's freaking

2138
03:28:22.56 --> 03:28:30.08
outstanding. You get picked up from warrant and then what's the next step? Next step is going to

2139
03:28:30.08 --> 03:28:36.32
my next attachment as the assistant attachment commander. And I was notified the team I was

2140
03:28:36.32 --> 03:28:42.16
going to go to about two weeks left of the war officer course. And the second I was told the

2141
03:28:42.16 --> 03:28:47.68
team number, I knew the type of team it was going to be, which was a maritime ops team, a dive team.

2142
03:28:47.68 --> 03:28:52.40
Yeah. Right. And SF all the teams that ended the number five, their dive teams.

2143
03:28:53.52 --> 03:28:58.48
All right, just completed the war officer course. First amputee to ever go is challenging as hell.

2144
03:29:00.32 --> 03:29:04.72
Believe it or not, it's, you know, there's a lot of physical stuff. But to go back a bit,

2145
03:29:04.72 --> 03:29:10.56
when I first got to group, the war officer on the teams, stereotypically, we're out of shape,

2146
03:29:10.56 --> 03:29:15.92
old guys that were never around. Well, the regiment realized that and they completely

2147
03:29:15.92 --> 03:29:21.36
re altered the actual course to include a lot of physical gates that you had to pass. Because

2148
03:29:21.36 --> 03:29:24.72
they didn't want these old crusty guy out of shape guys on teams anymore. If you're going to be a

2149
03:29:24.72 --> 03:29:28.48
war officer on a team, you need to be able to function as a team guy. And every ODA has the

2150
03:29:28.48 --> 03:29:35.52
assistant commander is a warrant. Is that right? Every ODA doesn't have a warrant. But because

2151
03:29:35.52 --> 03:29:40.64
it's a small community, most do and that guy is the assistant attachment commander. Because the

2152
03:29:40.64 --> 03:29:46.64
SF ODA, the 12 man construct is designed to run split team ops. It's not just rug a random number.

2153
03:29:46.64 --> 03:29:51.36
So the captain takes one section and the warrant takes the other. If there's no warrant, who takes

2154
03:29:51.36 --> 03:29:56.24
the other one? The the sergeant? The would would be the team sergeant. The team sergeant. Yeah,

2155
03:29:56.24 --> 03:30:01.92
the senior enlisted guy. Where does the captain get his experience before he's the captain of an ODA

2156
03:30:01.92 --> 03:30:05.92
team? Is he coming from infantry? Is that where he gets his initial experience as a leader, like

2157
03:30:05.92 --> 03:30:10.32
as a platoon commander or something? Yeah, most come from the infantry. They don't necessarily have

2158
03:30:10.32 --> 03:30:15.04
to have an infantry background. But they're I mean, they're green, even like the most experienced

2159
03:30:15.76 --> 03:30:21.36
new captain. In today's world, you're not seeing it that much because there's not a lot of combat,

2160
03:30:21.36 --> 03:30:27.20
but they get maybe one trip as a platoon leader in their conventional unit, go to the captain's

2161
03:30:27.20 --> 03:30:34.24
career course, go to the Q course and then show up. And that level of inexperience is why the SF

2162
03:30:34.24 --> 03:30:40.80
warrant officer exists, because their trajectory, they get two years on a team and then they're gone. So

2163
03:30:40.80 --> 03:30:46.32
the most senior captain on a team has been there for 24 months. Like that guy just barely figured

2164
03:30:46.32 --> 03:30:52.32
out his job, what an ODA does, how we fit within the overall picture. And then he's on to the next

2165
03:30:52.32 --> 03:30:56.72
thing. The warrant is there, you know, we're expected to do five, six years on the same

2166
03:30:56.72 --> 03:31:01.92
detachment, where there to be that strategic advisor to that leader. That's freaking legit.

2167
03:31:01.92 --> 03:31:08.64
So you get to dive team assignment or sorry, I cut you off. So you were saying that warrant

2168
03:31:08.64 --> 03:31:11.76
officer school was actually there were some there were some challenges in warrant officer school,

2169
03:31:11.76 --> 03:31:17.04
wasn't a walk in the park. No, no, it was it was legit. It was tough. So I mean, I got like two

2170
03:31:17.04 --> 03:31:21.12
weeks left before I'm going to graduate. I'm just about the top of this ridgeline, like graduation

2171
03:31:21.12 --> 03:31:25.68
is inevitable at this point. So I'm feeling pretty happy about my, you know, my performance and where

2172
03:31:25.68 --> 03:31:29.28
I'm going, I'm excited. And then I get the phone call, like you're going to this team right here.

2173
03:31:29.28 --> 03:31:35.52
Yeah. And I had the same response that everyone, every SF guy gets when he's totally going with

2174
03:31:35.52 --> 03:31:44.48
dive team, which is shit. Okay. Because everyone knows CDQC, the combat dive of qualification

2175
03:31:44.48 --> 03:31:51.52
course, everyone knows that that is the hottest school within the army by a mile, physically

2176
03:31:51.52 --> 03:31:57.04
and mentally. And most fearful of it, most don't want to go down that road. You know,

2177
03:31:57.04 --> 03:32:03.92
I had the same response. It was, okay, well, my celebration here was short lived because now

2178
03:32:03.92 --> 03:32:10.24
I got to figure out how I'm going to do this. Yeah, that sounds like, like I was giving all

2179
03:32:10.24 --> 03:32:13.60
these props to the army. I guess we got to give more prop. They're like, cool. Oh, you want to

2180
03:32:13.60 --> 03:32:19.36
be warrant? Cool. Oh, you got one leg house dive school sound. Yeah. And it's, I mean, it's funny

2181
03:32:19.36 --> 03:32:23.92
man because I got back to the group. I got to my new battalion and got assigned to my new team.

2182
03:32:23.92 --> 03:32:28.48
And I met with the company command team the next day. And within the first couple minutes of that

2183
03:32:28.48 --> 03:32:34.32
conversation, they told me that no one had any expectations of me going to dive school. Oh,

2184
03:32:35.20 --> 03:32:39.04
I had the same conversation with the battalion command team a couple days later and was told the

2185
03:32:39.04 --> 03:32:44.56
same thing from them, which I found was interesting, you know, and I looked at them kind of sideways.

2186
03:32:45.12 --> 03:32:50.48
And I said, listen, this team is there a bunch of aggressive savages to see. It's the most senior

2187
03:32:50.48 --> 03:32:57.36
team we have in the battalion. They're hungry for combat. They haven't seen it yet. We need a

2188
03:32:57.36 --> 03:33:01.92
strong leader on that team. There are only two warrant officer candidates. There were only two

2189
03:33:01.92 --> 03:33:10.000
of us in fifth group that went me and my buddy, me and my buddy Mike had wildly different experiences.

2190
03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:14.32
Mike did a lot of like interagency stuff and he was more on the technical side of things and did

2191
03:33:14.32 --> 03:33:19.28
a lot of intel stuff. My experience was like all combat. So they looked at both of our packets

2192
03:33:19.28 --> 03:33:23.76
and they're like, we can't send this guy to a dive team, especially this one. It's going to have to

2193
03:33:23.76 --> 03:33:28.88
be Nick, but it'll work because he's a strong leader. They'll respect them. It'll help keep things

2194
03:33:28.88 --> 03:33:37.44
moving in a general direction. Dive teams are known for being insubordinate, aggressive, you

2195
03:33:37.44 --> 03:33:43.28
know, it's the double edged sword for leadership because you got a really high performing

2196
03:33:43.28 --> 03:33:48.000
detachment, but you're going to have to deal with their aggressiveness and keeping them

2197
03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:53.12
within line in a garrison environment. So they made it clear to me that that was the reason why I

2198
03:33:53.12 --> 03:33:57.20
was going. And yet they didn't expect you to be actually going through dive school. Like that

2199
03:33:57.20 --> 03:34:02.96
wouldn't be a requirement necessarily is what they're thinking. And there as that's what they

2200
03:34:02.96 --> 03:34:07.84
were thinking. I didn't see it that way. Yeah, you're just like, okay, well, I got to go do dive school.

2201
03:34:08.72 --> 03:34:14.96
It's the one thing that separates dive teams from every other detachment is going through

2202
03:34:14.96 --> 03:34:20.40
that extra filter. And it's really irrelevant to the actual execution of maritime ops. It's just

2203
03:34:20.40 --> 03:34:26.96
that fine filter to be able to push yourself through that hell. And then you take 12 guys that

2204
03:34:26.96 --> 03:34:29.92
have all been through that and lump them together, they are going to be a high performing

2205
03:34:29.92 --> 03:34:36.08
detachment no matter the mission. Were you in the water much growing up? A little bit, but not much

2206
03:34:36.08 --> 03:34:41.60
of a group in New England, you know, so yeah, I mean, spent time in the water, but I wasn't a swimmer.

2207
03:34:41.60 --> 03:34:47.60
But okay, you know, never scoop a dive before nothing. So this is not going to be fun. No,

2208
03:34:49.68 --> 03:34:55.52
yeah, it's not going to be fun at all. You got to start training for it, right? Like you got to

2209
03:34:55.52 --> 03:35:00.40
start figuring out like getting comfortable in the water is a big deal. Do they normally pick guys

2210
03:35:00.40 --> 03:35:05.28
that were have some comfort in the water? Or do guys volunteer for does anyone volunteer for it?

2211
03:35:05.28 --> 03:35:10.48
Some do it's rare for a new a new dude to show and be like put me on a dive team. Most happy with

2212
03:35:10.48 --> 03:35:14.80
the little green hat in the head and they want to just like chill and just get to team stuff.

2213
03:35:15.68 --> 03:35:21.12
It does happen. It's not very often that it happens. I think the Sgt's major, they do ask if

2214
03:35:21.12 --> 03:35:24.96
there's an open slot on a dive team, hey, you know, you've come from a water, do you spend any time

2215
03:35:24.96 --> 03:35:32.88
swimming? You know, which I think brings value to your success and CDQC is more about your being

2216
03:35:32.88 --> 03:35:38.08
comfortable in the water, not necessarily your ability as a freestyle swimmer. Oh yeah, it's

2217
03:35:38.08 --> 03:35:42.56
definitely a comfort in the water. I mean, I haven't been through that school, but in in basic

2218
03:35:42.56 --> 03:35:48.72
seal training, you go through some pretty significant dive challenges and people it pays to be comfortable

2219
03:35:48.72 --> 03:35:53.68
in the water. You have to be. Yeah. So I do think they have that conversation. But if the answers

2220
03:35:53.68 --> 03:35:58.80
know and they needed another diver, it's like, okay, well, you're going anyway. And you had to fight

2221
03:35:58.80 --> 03:36:04.000
against a med board again, just kind of like get a waiver to go to this school. Yeah, it wasn't a

2222
03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:09.92
med board, but I did need a waiver approved to be able to go because of my physical profile.

2223
03:36:09.92 --> 03:36:16.000
So there had never been an amputee to even like consider going. And now I'm kind of back where

2224
03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:20.24
I was where I had to fight the admin fight and then also prepare myself physically and mentally.

2225
03:36:21.36 --> 03:36:26.16
So the admin side, it worked out great for me because I went through my dive physical, which is

2226
03:36:26.16 --> 03:36:30.24
the most in depth physical we have in the army, they check you for everything because it's just

2227
03:36:30.24 --> 03:36:35.28
just such a high stress school. There's two phases I get through both of those both are clean, both

2228
03:36:35.28 --> 03:36:42.56
are good to go. And then our med clinic sends up the waiver for me to be able to attend administratively.

2229
03:36:42.56 --> 03:36:47.76
Well, that needs to be approved by the SWCC surgeon, who's a full bird colonel. I said, okay,

2230
03:36:47.76 --> 03:36:54.08
cool, send it. I get a phone call about a week later from some 910 area code number, which is

2231
03:36:54.08 --> 03:36:58.72
North Carolina, answer the phone. And there's just some dude on the other end of the phone like yelling.

2232
03:36:58.72 --> 03:37:05.20
And he's talking about one legged guy who wants to go to dive school. And I think that someone had

2233
03:37:05.20 --> 03:37:10.56
just dialed my phone number by accident. And I'm over here in a conversation about me. And I'm going,

2234
03:37:10.56 --> 03:37:15.44
Hello, who is this? Dude's just yelling, talking real aggressively talking real fast. Finally,

2235
03:37:15.44 --> 03:37:24.32
he stops. I'm like, who is this? He's like, Nick, it's it's Mike. And I said, Doc, how you doing?

2236
03:37:24.32 --> 03:37:31.76
Well, Mike was the third group surgeon back when I was in Afghanistan. He was the first guy that

2237
03:37:31.76 --> 03:37:37.84
operated on me when I've got flown into Bagram. He had since been promoted to 06 and was working

2238
03:37:37.84 --> 03:37:42.40
as the SWCC surgeon. So he and I knew each other real well. I didn't know that that's where his job

2239
03:37:42.40 --> 03:37:49.12
was till he calls me. And I'm like, Oh, no kidding. Okay. He's like, I'm staring at your, your waiver

2240
03:37:49.12 --> 03:37:52.80
to the front of me right now. I said, you're going to approve it? He's like, Yeah, I already did.

2241
03:37:52.80 --> 03:37:58.08
I just sent it back. He's like, I think you add to your mind that you want to go do this. But

2242
03:37:58.08 --> 03:38:05.28
if you want to go, go ahead, like good luck. So, you know, ironic turn of events, if it was anybody

2243
03:38:05.28 --> 03:38:10.24
other than him, who knows if that would have been approved, because you are assuming quite a bit of

2244
03:38:10.24 --> 03:38:15.76
risk, both for him as the medical professional and then the commander in which he works underneath,

2245
03:38:15.76 --> 03:38:21.36
like they're assuming that risk to send you a course like that as a student. He gave me the

2246
03:38:21.36 --> 03:38:26.000
green light. And then once I had that, I had already been training, you know, physically my first day

2247
03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:32.08
on the team. I was in the pool. Day one, I just met these guys. It's my first day in this battalion.

2248
03:38:32.08 --> 03:38:38.16
It's my first day as a warrant officer. And I'm in the pool. You got to get like, fin legs or

2249
03:38:38.16 --> 03:38:43.12
some shit. Yeah. So I did, you know, and I went to my prosthetist and I said, I need a fin.

2250
03:38:43.12 --> 03:38:50.40
And they make, you know, fins for amputees. It's not, it's not like a new thing. He gave me this one.

2251
03:38:51.28 --> 03:38:57.44
And things may be, I don't know, three feet in length. It's small. And my teammates called it

2252
03:38:57.44 --> 03:39:02.48
my finding Nemo fin. It's just the difference between my leg and this thing was just so different.

2253
03:39:02.48 --> 03:39:08.08
But the concern was that, you know, if it's, if it's a longer lever, it places more force through

2254
03:39:08.08 --> 03:39:14.08
the socket, what's actually attaching to my body. So we were concerned that if it was too long, I

2255
03:39:14.08 --> 03:39:18.80
was generating too much force, it would rip the prosthetic off my body. So we went with the more

2256
03:39:18.80 --> 03:39:25.28
secured option, even though it gave me less propulsion. So that was what I had. And, you know,

2257
03:39:25.28 --> 03:39:27.92
I just said, you know, Roger, that this is my equipment, I'm just going to figure out how to

2258
03:39:27.92 --> 03:39:33.28
make it work. Really had to turn my left leg into just an absolute tank, because that's what was

2259
03:39:33.28 --> 03:39:38.32
propelling me for treading and for underwater nav and for all the finning was my left leg.

2260
03:39:38.88 --> 03:39:44.96
That's what I used in the pool during our train up. And, you know, my teammates were phenomenal.

2261
03:39:44.96 --> 03:39:50.08
But at the same time, it was no one really knew how to do this with a guy with one leg. So it

2262
03:39:50.08 --> 03:39:57.36
was a lot of trial and error and like figuring it out. Did that. And then I was in communication

2263
03:39:57.36 --> 03:40:02.56
with the leadership down at CDQC. They reached out to me once they were made aware that an amputee

2264
03:40:02.56 --> 03:40:07.28
was going to come down. It was a third group dude who was actually one of my instructors in the Q

2265
03:40:07.28 --> 03:40:12.72
course was now the Sergeant Major down there. So he hit me up and was like, Hey, man, just like,

2266
03:40:12.72 --> 03:40:18.56
keep me updated with if you're modifying any specific procedure, I just need to know what

2267
03:40:18.56 --> 03:40:23.92
that is. Because my instructors don't like know what this looks like. You know, so you know, like,

2268
03:40:24.64 --> 03:40:28.80
maritime ops, and especially in the schoolhouse, it's very procedural, like left foot here, right

2269
03:40:28.80 --> 03:40:34.48
foot here, it's broken down step by step by step to increase efficiency and reduce risk to keep it

2270
03:40:34.48 --> 03:40:39.28
as safe as possible. Well, for me, some of those steps just don't exist. If it's like,

2271
03:40:39.28 --> 03:40:43.60
put your right foot here, well, like I don't have one. So what am I doing when everyone else is

2272
03:40:43.60 --> 03:40:48.32
putting that right foot over there? So just those small little tweaks is what my team and I were

2273
03:40:48.32 --> 03:40:53.20
kind of playing around with. And then I messaged that to the cadre down there, it was ultimately

2274
03:40:53.20 --> 03:40:58.88
up to them to decide if what I was doing would meet their standard requirements.

2275
03:41:00.24 --> 03:41:05.92
Couple adaptations with a couple different things. But and then the CDQC journey.

2276
03:41:05.92 --> 03:41:15.12
What's the attrition rate at that school? It varies from 20% up to like 60%. There are some

2277
03:41:15.12 --> 03:41:20.88
classes that graduate like five guys. And if you just if you fail, they just send you back to SF,

2278
03:41:20.88 --> 03:41:27.36
you just can't be on a dive team type thing. You usually will get two or three attempts at it,

2279
03:41:27.36 --> 03:41:32.40
which is quite common. If you're afraid to take a guy maybe twice, how long is the school? Six

2280
03:41:32.40 --> 03:41:40.64
weeks. You got a section in here. You talk a little bit about this, which I had a lot of

2281
03:41:40.64 --> 03:41:48.16
Julian laughter when I was reading it. The combat diver qualification course or dive school has

2282
03:41:48.16 --> 03:41:52.48
several tests students must successfully complete. Each is designed with a purpose according to

2283
03:41:52.48 --> 03:41:56.96
years of data collection and lessons learned from generations of previous combat divers.

2284
03:41:56.96 --> 03:42:02.88
The most notorious is the one man competency exam. During this test, students are required to wear a

2285
03:42:02.88 --> 03:42:09.44
blacked out mask to simulate nighttime conditions and then surge underwater for several currents.

2286
03:42:09.44 --> 03:42:13.84
Once the surge phase is complete, the students are placed at the bottom of the pool and paired up

2287
03:42:13.84 --> 03:42:19.12
with an instructor who systematically removes the students air source regulator and in places a

2288
03:42:19.12 --> 03:42:25.92
series of deficiencies. So how do I breathe without a regulator? You don't you hold your breath.

2289
03:42:25.92 --> 03:42:30.40
The student is required to trace the air source line from its origination point to the regulator

2290
03:42:30.40 --> 03:42:36.08
while on a breath hold in order to retrieve the air source and breathe. This process is repeated

2291
03:42:36.08 --> 03:42:42.80
until the exam is completed. If this sounds awful, it is because it is just that awful. The one man

2292
03:42:42.80 --> 03:42:47.36
competency exam is widely considered the most difficult test within dive school and is the

2293
03:42:47.36 --> 03:42:52.88
reason why so many do not advance in the course. There is however a method to this madness.

2294
03:42:52.88 --> 03:42:58.24
Conducting underwater operations is arguably the most dangerous task we do within the military.

2295
03:42:58.24 --> 03:43:03.28
The ocean is unforgiving. A plethora of things can go wrong and as with most operations something

2296
03:43:03.28 --> 03:43:09.44
will almost certainly will go wrong. Given the fact that we as humans require oxygen above all

2297
03:43:09.44 --> 03:43:14.88
else to live problems underwater can quickly turn deadly. During underwater operations it is just

2298
03:43:14.88 --> 03:43:19.92
you and your team at times perhaps it is just you and your dive buddy and if things really go bad

2299
03:43:19.92 --> 03:43:24.72
it's just you. When a problem presents itself you absolutely must be able to correct it and

2300
03:43:24.72 --> 03:43:29.68
depending on the severity of the issue time becomes a critical factor every second counts

2301
03:43:29.68 --> 03:43:35.20
pressures at an all-time high. The stress of these situations can be incapacitating. The only way

2302
03:43:35.20 --> 03:43:43.04
to work through the situation is to remain calm. Good times. We have a test like that similar

2303
03:43:43.04 --> 03:43:47.92
that's called pool competency. It's the same thing they're just going to freaking jack you up underwater.

2304
03:43:49.52 --> 03:43:56.64
It's not fun. That's not fun. You got to fight the demons. Every survival instinct you have as humans

2305
03:43:56.64 --> 03:44:06.88
you got to battle through that. But you made it through. You made it through that dive things.

2306
03:44:06.88 --> 03:44:12.16
You failed a couple times. I failed one man twice. How many chances do you get? Three.

2307
03:44:13.76 --> 03:44:20.48
Yes. I blacked out underwater my first two go-arounds and my blackout experience they tell you

2308
03:44:21.36 --> 03:44:25.36
you know you're going to start to feel yourself going like when you're being choked out. I like

2309
03:44:25.36 --> 03:44:30.08
things get soft and start to feel yourself getting comfortable like you're on the verge of blacking

2310
03:44:30.08 --> 03:44:37.68
out. That doesn't happen with me. Mine is just continued increase in pain and discomfort and then

2311
03:44:38.56 --> 03:44:42.48
you're out and then I come to and I'm on the pool deck. What kind are you using a

2312
03:44:43.68 --> 03:44:49.44
normal regulator like the kind with one hose that you press a button and air comes out of it?

2313
03:44:49.44 --> 03:44:57.12
Yeah. You use an open water tank on your back with the standard regulator. We have this in

2314
03:44:57.12 --> 03:45:06.16
seal training. They have this regulator from like 1968 or something and it's got two hoses. One's an

2315
03:45:06.16 --> 03:45:10.72
inhalation hose and one's an exhalation hose and it looks like you know if you look at Jacques

2316
03:45:10.72 --> 03:45:17.12
Cousteau diving in 1973 like that's what he's using and there's no button to press.

2317
03:45:17.12 --> 03:45:22.40
You have to drink the water out. You just suck the water out of it when you put it back in your

2318
03:45:22.40 --> 03:45:26.96
mouth and they just take this thing and freak it out. It's insane. The only reason that this

2319
03:45:26.96 --> 03:45:31.92
regulator exists is for buds at this point. They still use this. They still use it. Wow.

2320
03:45:31.92 --> 03:45:39.68
They still use it to this day. It's crazy. It's crazy evolution. Yeah but I've talked to some of

2321
03:45:39.68 --> 03:45:44.48
the people that work at that company and they were like yeah that's the only people we make

2322
03:45:44.48 --> 03:45:48.88
for. I guess there's an occasional person that were requested if they're an underwater photographer

2323
03:45:48.88 --> 03:45:53.20
because the bubbles are behind your back but other than that it's just these because there's no

2324
03:45:53.20 --> 03:45:59.92
reason to use it. It's the worst piece of equipment ever for diving. They probably made it and like

2325
03:45:59.92 --> 03:46:08.16
a year later like hey this is dumb. Fix it but that's what we still use. Not fun. All right so you

2326
03:46:08.16 --> 03:46:14.88
get done. You pass. Now you're a one officer inside of your ODA team. Rack up another deployment. Where

2327
03:46:14.88 --> 03:46:22.32
are you going this one? The one after that we were in Iraq. Damn okay. Doing a lot of diving

2328
03:46:22.32 --> 03:46:29.60
in Iraq where are you? Not much. What year was that? 21. No kidding. Last year. We went in in

2329
03:46:29.60 --> 03:46:35.44
December of 20. December of 20 into 21. I mean from what you can say without going into classified

2330
03:46:35.44 --> 03:46:40.88
material like what was your general mission? Advise assist. I mean the Iraq of today is much

2331
03:46:40.88 --> 03:46:46.72
different than the Iraq of your days. How'd you like being the number two guy in command?

2332
03:46:48.40 --> 03:46:56.48
I enjoyed it. Yeah we did a couple split team scenarios but then because of what we were doing

2333
03:46:56.48 --> 03:47:03.52
was pretty routine myself and my actual team leader we would just swap out at times so I got

2334
03:47:03.52 --> 03:47:08.56
some reps at the detachment commander thing so it was good. And you liked that being in a leadership

2335
03:47:08.56 --> 03:47:16.000
position? Very much so. It's difficult as a warrant because a way it was described to me was it's a

2336
03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:22.32
commandless, thankless, selfless position. You know when you have that tripod of leadership,

2337
03:47:22.32 --> 03:47:27.44
the detachment commander, the captain, your senior enlisted guy, and then the warrant officer,

2338
03:47:28.16 --> 03:47:31.28
you know the detachment commander is in charge of the team. He runs the team.

2339
03:47:31.28 --> 03:47:37.20
The senior enlisted guy, the team sergeant, he runs the boys. They all work for him. The warrant

2340
03:47:37.20 --> 03:47:42.72
exists kind of in between that and the way you influence as a leader is more done through your

2341
03:47:42.72 --> 03:47:49.04
actions than it is about having one-on-one like molding sessions with the individuals because

2342
03:47:49.04 --> 03:47:53.76
that's really the job of the team sergeant. So your approach to leadership as a warrant

2343
03:47:54.32 --> 03:47:59.60
has to be a mature one which is tough for a lot of us because we're aggressive type A

2344
03:47:59.60 --> 03:48:05.76
pipe hitters who think we know exactly what Wright looks like so I have to stay back from that and

2345
03:48:05.76 --> 03:48:12.72
lead through supporting others and lead through more of your actions than your verbal mentorship.

2346
03:48:13.76 --> 03:48:19.04
It can be tough. And then so where are you at right now? Are you still at a team?

2347
03:48:19.60 --> 03:48:24.24
I just came off the team. And so where are you stationed now? I'm still at four Campbell,

2348
03:48:24.24 --> 03:48:30.32
still in fifth group. I just took over as the company operations warrant for our advanced

2349
03:48:30.32 --> 03:48:35.44
skills company. So when I was working in the combatives committee it was underneath the advanced

2350
03:48:35.44 --> 03:48:41.28
skills company. So now amongst the company level leadership where I work alongside a major

2351
03:48:41.28 --> 03:48:48.16
and a sergeant major. Got it. You know that kind of brings us up to date for this,

2352
03:48:48.16 --> 03:48:55.12
for where you're at right? What you got going on. You know that this is the thing though about this

2353
03:48:55.12 --> 03:49:04.80
book is this book, this book objective secure, it's not a memoir of your life. It's not like hey,

2354
03:49:04.80 --> 03:49:15.52
here's a bunch of stories. It's actually like almost like a field manual of how you can overcome

2355
03:49:15.52 --> 03:49:23.92
things and how you can achieve things in life, which is a pretty awesome book. And look, obviously

2356
03:49:23.92 --> 03:49:28.32
I read some of the stories out of it today because you relate oh this event happened. Here's you know

2357
03:49:28.32 --> 03:49:32.16
what occurred. Here's what caused me to do this. Here's where I learned this lesson. There's a lot

2358
03:49:32.16 --> 03:49:38.40
of that stuff in there. But the actual book is I mean the subtitle of the book is battle tested

2359
03:49:38.40 --> 03:49:47.44
guide to goal achievement, right? Which is freaking legit. Like hey, here's a guy that has gone through

2360
03:49:47.44 --> 03:49:55.52
a bunch of obstacles and overcome those obstacles. And he did it not by luck, not by miracles, but by

2361
03:49:55.52 --> 03:50:00.24
figuring out how to assess these things and how to overcome them. And you take the military

2362
03:50:01.44 --> 03:50:05.60
methodology that you learned from being in special operations and you apply that to your life and

2363
03:50:05.60 --> 03:50:12.56
apply that to the challenge you face and you outline that throughout this book. And that's why if

2364
03:50:12.56 --> 03:50:16.16
you know if you're listening right now just order this book right now because there's so much good

2365
03:50:16.16 --> 03:50:23.76
information in it to help anybody that's overcoming anything. That's facing any obstacles, but I would

2366
03:50:23.76 --> 03:50:28.56
feel bad if I didn't at least give people sort of a heads up sort of some of the highlights that you

2367
03:50:28.56 --> 03:50:35.92
go over in the book. So I just want to crack this thing open and like just like I said just hit some

2368
03:50:35.92 --> 03:50:43.20
of the high points of how you live your life, how you overcame these things. The book is called

2369
03:50:43.20 --> 03:50:48.08
objective secure. You start off with objective secure a military brevity term used during the

2370
03:50:48.08 --> 03:50:52.24
execution of combat operations meaning the location or target has been isolated and contained,

2371
03:50:52.24 --> 03:50:57.36
the assault force has eliminated all known threats and the element is prepared to move to the next

2372
03:50:57.36 --> 03:51:04.000
objective phase of the operations of the operation. Reaching objective secure during a combat

2373
03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:09.04
operation is a good feeling. It means we have a foothold, a location to re-consolidate,

2374
03:51:09.04 --> 03:51:14.72
establish communications, prepare stage and if necessary fall back to. But this does not mean

2375
03:51:14.72 --> 03:51:22.48
the mission is complete. Objective secure in our context here is twofold. First it is a victory,

2376
03:51:22.48 --> 03:51:27.92
a milestone, it marks the success of achieving a necessary goal along the route to mission

2377
03:51:27.92 --> 03:51:34.40
accomplishment. Second it is a tool, a system, a methodology, a process designed to manifest

2378
03:51:34.40 --> 03:51:40.48
our reality. Objective secure is a philosophy and a blueprint that was created in real time,

2379
03:51:40.48 --> 03:51:46.56
refined, then retrospectively analyzed following years of trial and error, years of failure,

2380
03:51:46.56 --> 03:51:53.60
years of obstacles and years of adversity. It was forged by fire and is battle tested literally.

2381
03:51:56.16 --> 03:52:05.04
Objective secure. Did you have that name out of the gate for the book? No, not at all. I mean,

2382
03:52:06.16 --> 03:52:13.60
I created this thing. The original objective secure was about a nine page Microsoft Word

2383
03:52:13.60 --> 03:52:21.52
document that I slapped together as the result of being asked the same question hundreds and hundreds

2384
03:52:21.52 --> 03:52:27.60
of times was how did you do what you did? So rather than answering those every single time,

2385
03:52:28.16 --> 03:52:32.40
what you're email address. Yeah, I said, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to answer that

2386
03:52:32.40 --> 03:52:38.08
question, put a little more thought into it and that way I can just attach and send. It was about

2387
03:52:38.08 --> 03:52:41.76
efficiency. I created the original one of these things, a purely out of efficiency to answer

2388
03:52:41.76 --> 03:52:47.28
the question to provide that information to those that were seeking it. It wasn't until years later,

2389
03:52:47.28 --> 03:52:53.52
I used it as such for years. It wasn't until years later that a good buddy of mine, now my

2390
03:52:53.52 --> 03:52:58.24
business partner, hit me up. I was actually still in dive school. I had about a week left and he

2391
03:52:58.24 --> 03:53:04.64
called me out of the blue and said, I think you need to write a book. And I said, get out of here.

2392
03:53:04.64 --> 03:53:09.36
What are you talking about? Dude, I'm clinging by a thread down here. I'm exhausted. I can't even

2393
03:53:09.36 --> 03:53:13.84
have this conversation with you. We eventually circled back a couple of weeks later and I gave

2394
03:53:13.84 --> 03:53:20.16
it some thought. And this is in the middle of 2020 COVID. I got a lot of extra time and energy on my

2395
03:53:20.16 --> 03:53:26.72
hands. Gyms are closed. The combatives house is closed. We're doing this weird half on half off

2396
03:53:26.72 --> 03:53:31.68
work schedule, you know, remote LPD sessions. It was just a strange time. I had a lot of extra

2397
03:53:31.68 --> 03:53:37.52
time and energy that I otherwise wouldn't have had. So out of respect to him, I gave it some thought

2398
03:53:37.52 --> 03:53:43.20
about that Microsoft Word doc. And I said, I actually kind of have something. And he said,

2399
03:53:43.20 --> 03:53:48.32
just keep going with it and see what it turns into. So I sunk my teeth into it and became

2400
03:53:48.32 --> 03:53:52.88
real obsessed with it. I really found out that I actually enjoy writing, which if you had asked me

2401
03:53:52.88 --> 03:53:58.88
that a week before this, I would have said no, no interest, but I actually do enjoy it. But I didn't

2402
03:53:58.88 --> 03:54:03.68
figure out the title until maybe about the halfway point. I started thinking about it.

2403
03:54:03.68 --> 03:54:11.20
And then it kind of kind of flipped. Yeah, you got what you the way you run your life and it

2404
03:54:11.20 --> 03:54:14.16
becomes really clear in the book. I haven't touched on these part of the books yet. But like,

2405
03:54:14.80 --> 03:54:19.60
you're you're very calculating in everything that you do. This is what I need to get done. Here's

2406
03:54:19.60 --> 03:54:25.68
what and that's what makes this so effective. And obviously, it's worth outstanding for you to be

2407
03:54:25.68 --> 03:54:34.16
able to pull off the kind of shit that you've pulled off. That comes across. And one of the things

2408
03:54:34.16 --> 03:54:39.28
that one of the ways that you break down the book is you use some of the well, you use the way you

2409
03:54:39.28 --> 03:54:45.36
learn things in the army. And one of the things that you talk about is the ethos, the warrior ethos.

2410
03:54:45.68 --> 03:54:51.04
And here's part of it. I will always place the mission first. Now I realize the term mission

2411
03:54:51.04 --> 03:54:55.92
has a strong military undertone, but this absolutely applies to everybody because everybody has

2412
03:54:55.92 --> 03:55:01.36
dreams. That's what the mission is. It's a dream, the long term goal. The mission is what is waiting

2413
03:55:01.36 --> 03:55:05.68
at the end of the road. Missions are impactful, often life changing. But for many, the mission

2414
03:55:05.68 --> 03:55:11.68
will remain just that a dream. Many do not reach mission success. Many do not turn the dream into

2415
03:55:11.68 --> 03:55:19.92
a reality. Those who do are able to recognize the need for something. Sacrifice, a subset of

2416
03:55:19.92 --> 03:55:27.04
discipline, something we'll get into later, the active forgoing what we want for what we need.

2417
03:55:29.04 --> 03:55:35.76
So you break these things down. So when we say, I'm fast forwarding. So when we say,

2418
03:55:35.76 --> 03:55:41.12
I will always leave, I will always place the mission first. What we are saying is, I will

2419
03:55:41.12 --> 03:55:48.72
make the necessary sacrifices, and I will prioritize my time. And again, I'm like jump,

2420
03:55:48.72 --> 03:55:54.88
you've got all kinds of applications of this where people read and be like, oh, I think that

2421
03:55:54.88 --> 03:55:59.68
might be me right there. Oh, I think he's talking about me over here. Or Oh, I need to do, I need

2422
03:55:59.68 --> 03:56:05.04
to do better on that thing. So this, this, this book is very practical from that perspective.

2423
03:56:06.96 --> 03:56:10.16
The next section I'll read is I will never accept defeat.

2424
03:56:11.36 --> 03:56:16.08
This statement has a somewhat obvious meaning behind it, resolve, resiliency,

2425
03:56:16.08 --> 03:56:22.96
and toughness. The mentality is that if you get knocked down seven times, you get up eight.

2426
03:56:24.32 --> 03:56:28.56
Pretty, pretty straightforward. I'm going to read one little section out of this.

2427
03:56:28.56 --> 03:56:34.56
Our egos do not digest failure easily. Our egos want us to constantly project strength,

2428
03:56:34.56 --> 03:56:38.64
ability and knowledge. Our egos can prevent us from asking questions and pushing our

2429
03:56:38.64 --> 03:56:45.84
limitations. Humility requires allowing ourselves to become vulnerable, to expose our weaknesses,

2430
03:56:45.84 --> 03:56:49.92
things that are extremely difficult for most and for individuals who work in the special

2431
03:56:49.92 --> 03:56:55.52
operations community, they're next to impossible. Gotta stay humble.

2432
03:56:57.60 --> 03:57:04.32
Can be tough. So when we say I will never accept defeat, what we are saying is strive

2433
03:57:04.32 --> 03:57:10.48
for failure. And when you reach it, learn from it, apply it and keep moving forward.

2434
03:57:10.48 --> 03:57:19.76
Again, a bunch of good examples you throw in here about this. And all totally pragmatic.

2435
03:57:21.52 --> 03:57:24.88
Next one, I will never quit. Initially, this sounds similar to what we just talked about,

2436
03:57:24.88 --> 03:57:29.60
but upon further examination, we'll recognize the difference. I will never quit is about

2437
03:57:29.60 --> 03:57:34.80
avoiding complacency. It is not letting ourselves get comfortable not celebrating too long,

2438
03:57:34.80 --> 03:57:40.88
not accepting status quo and not growing stagnant. It is adopting the principle that satisfaction

2439
03:57:40.88 --> 03:57:53.92
doesn't exist. And that now is the time to attack. Check. These things have a lot more meaning.

2440
03:57:54.72 --> 03:58:00.72
When determining the appropriate rucksack, we need to think about the mission. We need to

2441
03:58:00.72 --> 03:58:04.80
choose the right size rucksack for the job. Choose one too small will not be able to bring the

2442
03:58:04.80 --> 03:58:09.44
necessary equipment. Choose one too large and we tend to fill the extra space with things we want

2443
03:58:09.44 --> 03:58:15.28
rather than only the things we need ounces equal pounds. Next thing you know, we're humping 70 pounds

2444
03:58:15.28 --> 03:58:22.32
instead of 60 pounds. At first, this may go unnoticed. But as the miles continue, the extra 10

2445
03:58:22.32 --> 03:58:28.08
pounds take their toll. This will undoubtedly increase fatigue and reduce focus and ability,

2446
03:58:28.08 --> 03:58:33.84
leaving us less effective when it is time to go to work. And this is what made me want to read

2447
03:58:33.84 --> 03:58:41.44
this same as with ounces, minutes become hours, hours become days, days become weeks. And before

2448
03:58:41.44 --> 03:58:53.20
you know it, a year has passed with little to show for it. Later in the book, you got some of your

2449
03:58:53.20 --> 03:59:00.24
time like you got your daily schedule written out. It's like to the minute. Yeah, there's no time

2450
03:59:00.24 --> 03:59:06.000
being wasted for freaking Nick. Now we're next on the mission, man. When Nick's trying to get back

2451
03:59:06.000 --> 03:59:20.000
to an ODA team, there's not a second wasted. Can't. Can't. I mean, for one, just the gift of perspective

2452
03:59:20.000 --> 03:59:28.80
with coming as close to death as I did, driving in how precious life is and how time is our most

2453
03:59:28.80 --> 03:59:35.60
limited resource and just to maximize the gift of we have of minute to minute to minute, just that

2454
03:59:35.60 --> 03:59:43.04
perspective was given to me through what happened. And then when you've got, you know, big goals,

2455
03:59:43.04 --> 03:59:51.12
that's what it takes. That's what it took for me. Anyway, I think that's actually just what it takes.

2456
03:59:51.92 --> 03:59:58.000
Not just for you, but for anybody. I will never leave a comrade. I will never leave a fallen

2457
03:59:58.000 --> 04:00:02.32
comrade. We know the obvious meaning behind this, the meaning reserved for the warfighter,

2458
04:00:02.32 --> 04:00:07.44
the mentality that no matter what, nobody gets left behind. When we open the aperture a bit,

2459
04:00:07.44 --> 04:00:15.28
however, this tenant is speaking to a commitment to doing whatever it takes. Yeah, there's not too

2460
04:00:15.28 --> 04:00:21.12
many, there's not too many sayings that have the word never in them, right? And that's what this is.

2461
04:00:21.12 --> 04:00:27.92
This is like the commitment. You talk about this in this section when we understand that

2462
04:00:27.92 --> 04:00:33.52
everybody eventually hits a decision point and that when they do most give in our decision

2463
04:00:33.52 --> 04:00:38.40
point becomes an opportunity. Man, we were just talking about this the other day, like your life,

2464
04:00:38.40 --> 04:00:43.52
our lives are just a bunch of decisions. They're just, they're just all decisions. What are you

2465
04:00:43.52 --> 04:00:46.64
going to do? What are you going to eat? What are you going to get up? What are you going to do today?

2466
04:00:46.64 --> 04:00:51.60
What progress do you make? What time are you going to waste? You say it gives us a chance to either

2467
04:00:51.60 --> 04:00:58.16
extend our lead or make up ground on our competition. Through this understanding, we will begin to

2468
04:00:58.16 --> 04:01:03.20
welcome these decision points. We will seek them. We will find ourselves intentionally pushing

2469
04:01:03.20 --> 04:01:09.12
until we find ourselves standing at the crossroads. And when we arrive, when most would find themselves

2470
04:01:09.12 --> 04:01:15.04
conflicted, we are not, we embrace it. So when we say, I will never leave a fallen comrade,

2471
04:01:15.04 --> 04:01:21.12
what we are saying is, I will do whatever it takes to make it. At times, we have to ignore the brain,

2472
04:01:21.12 --> 04:01:29.60
listen to the heart and take the risk. It's weird how many decisions you make without even

2473
04:01:29.60 --> 04:01:34.88
thinking about it, the fact that you have a choice, right? You just, people just allow things to

2474
04:01:34.88 --> 04:01:42.88
happen in their lives. Sure. Oh, that just, you know, what are you doing today? Oh, you know,

2475
04:01:43.76 --> 04:01:48.40
like, no, that's not part of the plan. That's not part of the plan. That's not going to work.

2476
04:01:48.40 --> 04:01:55.68
That's not going to work. Nick knows what he's doing. He knows what he's doing on Sunday afternoon

2477
04:01:55.68 --> 04:02:08.96
at 1340. He knows what's up. And this is where you break down how we're going to execute this.

2478
04:02:09.52 --> 04:02:13.28
So like, you just kind of talked about the mindset through the warrior ethos. Now you get into the

2479
04:02:13.28 --> 04:02:19.28
execution of this whole thing. Phase one is the mission. Here's where we identify the mission.

2480
04:02:19.28 --> 04:02:22.48
And again, how many people are going through life? They don't even have their mission identified.

2481
04:02:22.48 --> 04:02:28.000
I'd say a lot. You know, I've talked about the fact that I was very lucky because when I was very

2482
04:02:28.000 --> 04:02:35.04
young, I joined the Navy and I just wanted to be a good seal. And what like that gives you,

2483
04:02:35.04 --> 04:02:40.96
you can make so many decisions based on that, you can make, you can do so much just on having a goal

2484
04:02:40.96 --> 04:02:48.64
like that. Here's where we identify the mission. This is a long term goal, the dream, the what we

2485
04:02:48.64 --> 04:02:53.52
are trying to accomplish, the who we aspire to become. There's a reason why this is phase one

2486
04:02:53.52 --> 04:03:00.40
is it is exceedingly important. If we botch this up, we may be making progress, but progress in the

2487
04:03:00.40 --> 04:03:07.12
wrong direction. So if you're listening right now, and you don't know what your mission is,

2488
04:03:07.12 --> 04:03:11.36
you're already, you already got a significant problem. You get a problem going on because where

2489
04:03:11.36 --> 04:03:17.92
are you going? Where are you going right now? What is your mission? If you don't have a mission,

2490
04:03:17.92 --> 04:03:27.12
you need to figure out what it is 100%. And yeah, I think that the way that you

2491
04:03:28.88 --> 04:03:33.92
like had that memory freaking woke up from a coma without a leg and we're like cool,

2492
04:03:33.92 --> 04:03:37.60
I'm going back to an ODA team. There's my mission. Like this is what I'm doing.

2493
04:03:40.48 --> 04:03:45.12
Design, we must have a solid understanding of our current situation, our mission, our obstacles,

2494
04:03:45.12 --> 04:03:49.20
and how we are going to advance. This may sound intimidating, but don't let it overwhelm you.

2495
04:03:49.84 --> 04:03:54.88
And then you break out. You know, there's another thing we didn't talk about. We didn't talk about

2496
04:03:54.88 --> 04:04:02.08
the fact that once you didn't have a leg, you're like, all right, I need to be beneficial to my

2497
04:04:02.08 --> 04:04:06.64
team in other ways beyond just physical, you know, you're going to be able to hold this

2498
04:04:06.64 --> 04:04:10.64
standard. And I would say you probably do a lot better than the standard, but you're like, hey,

2499
04:04:10.64 --> 04:04:14.72
there might be some deficiencies that I have because I only have one freaking leg.

2500
04:04:14.72 --> 04:04:21.12
So I'm going to make up for that. And you started going to some of the more cerebral parts of

2501
04:04:21.76 --> 04:04:27.60
special forces started going to schools to learn, you know, operational art and design.

2502
04:04:28.96 --> 04:04:33.04
And that way you had something else to offer. You know, it was like almost like a backup plan.

2503
04:04:33.04 --> 04:04:38.24
If you didn't have it all physically, which again, I would, I would say you definitely have a

2504
04:04:38.24 --> 04:04:41.44
physical, but if you had some slack there, you're going to be able to make up for it.

2505
04:04:41.44 --> 04:04:46.72
Yeah, that was a conscious decision that you made. Yeah, no, that was tough to accept that growing up

2506
04:04:46.72 --> 04:04:51.76
as an athlete and a fighter and, you know, being that door kicker on the team is what my team wanted

2507
04:04:51.76 --> 04:04:57.76
of me. It's what I enjoy doing, spend time in the gym, the fight house on the range. And everybody

2508
04:04:57.76 --> 04:05:03.84
was a win-win accepting the fact that no matter how hard I trained, I was never going to be as

2509
04:05:03.84 --> 04:05:10.24
physically dominant as I was with two legs. How can I make up the difference and still be that asset?

2510
04:05:10.24 --> 04:05:13.76
And this was in the hospital. I was still an inpatient status living in the hospital,

2511
04:05:13.76 --> 04:05:17.84
going through surgeries when this happened. And actually the Ususak commander at the time,

2512
04:05:17.84 --> 04:05:23.04
General Cleveland, he showed up just to visit me. We had a conversation and that's what opened up my

2513
04:05:23.04 --> 04:05:31.20
eyes to the other skills within being an all-encompassing green beret or an effective ODA,

2514
04:05:31.20 --> 04:05:35.60
kind of the soft side of our business. You know, most of us come in because we want to kick

2515
04:05:35.60 --> 04:05:39.44
down doors and shoot bad guys in the face, but there's a lot of other skills and tasks that

2516
04:05:39.44 --> 04:05:49.04
enable that to be able to happen. So I recognized it then and committed to it in my own personal time.

2517
04:05:49.04 --> 04:05:54.32
So rather than reading about exercise physiology or nutrition, I was reading about cultural dynamics

2518
04:05:54.32 --> 04:06:00.80
in Afghanistan. I was enhancing my foreign language skills. I hated doing this stuff, man.

2519
04:06:00.80 --> 04:06:06.000
I absolutely hated it. I loved the way I spent my time with two legs. I didn't want to do this at all,

2520
04:06:06.000 --> 04:06:15.52
but I believed that it would work. I just forced myself to do it, man, which I'm preaching to the

2521
04:06:16.64 --> 04:06:23.92
gospel or I'm preaching to the choir on this is like the discipline to execute on the tasks that

2522
04:06:23.92 --> 04:06:30.80
you know will bring value is the road to success. Doing the thing whether or not you feel like

2523
04:06:30.80 --> 04:06:35.44
doing it or not. And I know you're the subject matter expert on this. I've learned a lot of this

2524
04:06:35.44 --> 04:06:40.96
from you personally during all of the stuff we're talking about. It's like, did the research,

2525
04:06:40.96 --> 04:06:46.40
I know this will work or I'm confident this will work. Yeah, it sucks. But doing the things that

2526
04:06:46.40 --> 04:06:51.92
suck is what separates the average from the great. So diving myself into this road, operational

2527
04:06:51.92 --> 04:06:56.80
design was a school I went to. I needed to waive it ago because I was an E6 and it's reserved for

2528
04:06:56.80 --> 04:07:01.44
more senior leaders who are going to be dealing with like campaign planning and type stuff. But I

2529
04:07:01.44 --> 04:07:07.84
went as a tool to increase my cerebral and intellectual capacity overall. But then I was

2530
04:07:07.84 --> 04:07:14.000
able to leverage what I learned in the course and apply it to my mission. Take the lessons learned

2531
04:07:14.000 --> 04:07:20.88
and actually use those techniques to outline my day-to-day life and my operational approach. So

2532
04:07:20.88 --> 04:07:26.24
it was multifaceted what I was able to leverage by doing that. Yeah, it's almost like what we

2533
04:07:26.24 --> 04:07:29.68
were talking about earlier with leadership and how leadership is a skill. Well, you know,

2534
04:07:29.68 --> 04:07:37.60
planning is a skill and designing courses of action to overcome obstacles. It's not just

2535
04:07:37.60 --> 04:07:41.84
something you're born with. You can actually learn how to do it. And that's what you did. You went

2536
04:07:41.84 --> 04:07:45.44
and learned how to do it. And here you look, you applied it in the field, but here you're applying

2537
04:07:45.44 --> 04:07:51.36
it to your life. You go through this, you go through this phase diagram. You got all these

2538
04:07:51.36 --> 04:07:58.56
diagrams in here, determine your current situation, define the mission, frame the problem, identify

2539
04:07:58.56 --> 04:08:04.56
lines of effort. You go through this whole thing. And then once you figure out what the lines of

2540
04:08:04.56 --> 04:08:09.04
effort are, you talk about how you're going to now attack those lines. You got the next phase,

2541
04:08:09.04 --> 04:08:13.12
which is research. Access to information has never been as readily available as it is today.

2542
04:08:14.000 --> 04:08:19.20
Never. There's absolutely no excuse to be uninformed. I don't know how it's just that

2543
04:08:19.20 --> 04:08:23.28
an excuse and a avoidable reason. We must set ourselves up for success. The key to this phase,

2544
04:08:23.28 --> 04:08:27.52
however, is to move quickly. We cannot get stuck here. The research is solely to get the wheel

2545
04:08:27.52 --> 04:08:34.88
spinning and provide some direction to advance down our lines of effort. And you give examples of this.

2546
04:08:36.48 --> 04:08:41.60
What is it? One of the examples you give is, hey, I'm living in a crappy house. I want to get a new

2547
04:08:41.60 --> 04:08:46.64
house. Here's the things I can do. Here's the problem. Here's how I can make this happen. It's a

2548
04:08:46.64 --> 04:08:50.64
campaign plan. Oh, I got to get a cheaper rent right now so I can save more money. I got to get

2549
04:08:50.64 --> 04:08:55.60
some additional income. You go through it. Another one you got in here is, what is it becoming an

2550
04:08:55.60 --> 04:09:01.76
instructor? Right? Like, these are things that you're doing to, you've actually taken these

2551
04:09:01.76 --> 04:09:09.60
methodologies and applied them to your life. And it's not complicated. Next phase is approach.

2552
04:09:09.60 --> 04:09:13.92
This is where we create our approach. We have already determined our long-term goal, our mission,

2553
04:09:13.92 --> 04:09:19.12
our 300 meter target. We have also identified our lines of effort, the broad conceptual categories

2554
04:09:19.12 --> 04:09:23.12
along which we will advance. In phase four, we are going to implement the list of tasks and

2555
04:09:23.12 --> 04:09:27.76
considerations. We identified through research the series of short-term goals that exist between

2556
04:09:27.76 --> 04:09:37.52
where we are now and where we are trying to go along our lines of advance. These are our objectives

2557
04:09:38.56 --> 04:09:46.80
our 25, 50, 100 and 200 meter targets. Here is where we prioritize, organize and correlate

2558
04:09:46.80 --> 04:09:51.76
along the timeline. So again, there's another place where people can get caught up, right? Oh,

2559
04:09:51.76 --> 04:09:57.36
I created a good idea. I have a good plan. And then they don't execute on it. They don't, they don't,

2560
04:09:57.36 --> 04:10:00.32
well, not that they don't execute, we're going to get there, but they don't figure out what do I

2561
04:10:00.32 --> 04:10:06.40
need to actually do to get there? Like, okay, I see that I want a new house. I know I need money.

2562
04:10:06.40 --> 04:10:10.24
How am I going to get more money? That's what this is. What are you going to, what do you do?

2563
04:10:10.24 --> 04:10:17.04
What are you going to actually make happen here? Freaking, again, these things seem obvious.

2564
04:10:17.04 --> 04:10:26.56
Yes. It's, it's really not that complicated. And I think a lot of people ask that question how

2565
04:10:27.20 --> 04:10:34.08
to whoever they look up to will learn from wanting a complicated answer, because it just

2566
04:10:34.08 --> 04:10:41.52
enables the excuse. Well, this is just too complex. Well, he's a seal. He's a green beret.

2567
04:10:41.52 --> 04:10:46.16
Like I can't, I'm not either of those things. So this doesn't apply to me. It's like, it's actually

2568
04:10:46.16 --> 04:10:53.92
quite simple. It's not necessarily easy, but it is simple. Yeah. The amount of times I've been asked,

2569
04:10:54.56 --> 04:10:58.72
how do you get up early in the morning? And my response is, oh, I set my alarm clock or when

2570
04:10:58.72 --> 04:11:06.56
it goes off, I get out of bed. That's legitimately what it is. Yeah. So when your alarm clock goes

2571
04:11:06.56 --> 04:11:15.44
off, you get out of bed. That's what you do. That must be, it's simple, not easy. Simple.

2572
04:11:15.44 --> 04:11:19.04
That freaking pillow, that pillow grabs a hold to echo Charles over there. I think

2573
04:11:19.68 --> 04:11:23.60
you get strangled by that. You can put a chokehold over there. It's very dangerous.

2574
04:11:25.84 --> 04:11:31.76
Here's another place people miss out. You got to execute. Phase five, execute, discipline. Discipline

2575
04:11:31.76 --> 04:11:37.60
is controlled behavior. In other words, it is the combination of sacrifice and time prioritization.

2576
04:11:38.80 --> 04:11:43.12
Warrior ethos one, I will always place the mission first with discipline. We are stopping

2577
04:11:43.12 --> 04:11:51.44
ourselves from doing what we like or want to do and or forcing ourselves to do things we need to do.

2578
04:11:57.52 --> 04:12:03.04
That's another thing. I'll use that answer sometimes. Like, you know what you need to do.

2579
04:12:04.24 --> 04:12:05.92
Actually know what you need to do. You're just not doing it.

2580
04:12:07.04 --> 04:12:10.96
Like you're not going to get better at jujitsu, not doing jujitsu. You're not going to get in

2581
04:12:10.96 --> 04:12:16.88
good shape by not working out. You know what you need to do. Like you said, I think there's people

2582
04:12:16.88 --> 04:12:21.12
that want you to say, well, there's a big complex thing that we need to discuss. There's actually

2583
04:12:21.12 --> 04:12:33.76
not. There's actually not. Just stop doing it. Just stop doing it. Focus to remain disciplined.

2584
04:12:33.76 --> 04:12:38.80
We must remain focused. This right here is essential. We have our plan. It's broken down into a

2585
04:12:38.80 --> 04:12:42.80
series of objectives. Each objective has a series of requirements and tasks that we must accomplish

2586
04:12:42.80 --> 04:12:47.44
to reach objective secure. We know there will be a host of challenges and obstacles along the way

2587
04:12:47.44 --> 04:12:53.12
we anticipate setbacks. We project failures. We are prepared. But what are we actually focusing

2588
04:12:53.12 --> 04:13:00.40
on during the process? The reality of it is it's our choice. Picture you getting your purple belt

2589
04:13:00.40 --> 04:13:13.28
here, by the way, 2016. Check. How many times a week you train? Now? Yeah. I'm coming off a

2590
04:13:13.28 --> 04:13:20.32
shoulder surgery. So none, but usually two, three days. Uh huh. Yeah. What happened to shoulder?

2591
04:13:20.96 --> 04:13:28.88
I told my labrum. Doing jujitsu? No, this was just wear and tear, but I completely dislocated it back

2592
04:13:28.88 --> 04:13:37.68
in 14 in a jujitsu tournament. Shredded the labrum. Put it back together. Wait, 2014,

2593
04:13:37.68 --> 04:13:43.52
isn't that when you were still a white belt? I think I, in this particular tournament, I just

2594
04:13:43.52 --> 04:13:48.40
belted blue. Yeah. There's a lot of people that were unhappy the day they saw you in the freaking

2595
04:13:48.40 --> 04:13:55.04
bracket. You know what I'm saying? Well, I mean, especially it's, you know, it's a weight class

2596
04:13:55.04 --> 04:14:00.000
sport, right? So I mean, from the waist up, if you looked at me versus my opponents, like,

2597
04:14:00.000 --> 04:14:04.32
there's no way these guys are in the same weight class. Oh, shit. How much do you weigh right

2598
04:14:04.32 --> 04:14:12.32
now? Right now, I'm probably 215. What would you weigh if you had your other leg? 250? Yeah,

2599
04:14:12.32 --> 04:14:17.44
that's, you know, that's 45 pounds of leg is just not there anymore. Wait, so you said right now,

2600
04:14:17.44 --> 04:14:24.24
you weigh what right now? About 215. 215. Yeah, that's messing up some people's,

2601
04:14:24.24 --> 04:14:28.40
some people have bummed out where they see that bracket. They're looking at you going,

2602
04:14:28.40 --> 04:14:35.52
there's, hey, get a scale. Yeah. And I went to the hospital, I learned a lot from Anthony Robles,

2603
04:14:35.52 --> 04:14:40.000
all American wrestler born with one leg at Arizona State. I read his book, Unstoppable,

2604
04:14:40.000 --> 04:14:43.92
to help me with my training. And it's funny, there's an excerpt in the book from his mother

2605
04:14:43.92 --> 04:14:49.52
who talks about how when he was real young, the other parents would be like, Hey, this isn't fair.

2606
04:14:49.52 --> 04:14:53.92
He only has one leg, like go easy on him, you know, because he was learning how to do it. So

2607
04:14:53.92 --> 04:14:59.68
they, they noticed that as a disadvantage and they felt bad for him. Well, once he got real good

2608
04:15:00.56 --> 04:15:04.96
and beefed up his upper body, it was the complete opposite where now the parents are going, this

2609
04:15:04.96 --> 04:15:10.56
isn't fair because he's wrestling at, you know, 205, but really he's got the upper body of someone

2610
04:15:10.56 --> 04:15:18.08
who's 235. So it just went to complete 180. It's like, I can take advantage of this. Yeah. Yeah.

2611
04:15:18.08 --> 04:15:26.88
Damn. You got a section in this part, hard work now that we choose to stay on track,

2612
04:15:26.88 --> 04:15:32.08
it's time to put in the work. Here's where the tangible gains are made bottom line up front.

2613
04:15:32.08 --> 04:15:37.44
Good things come to those who work hard. Great things, however, come to those who are willing

2614
04:15:37.44 --> 04:15:41.60
to do whatever it takes to those who are willing to push themselves to a higher level.

2615
04:15:41.60 --> 04:15:49.52
We're going a little beyond hard work. We're going to freaking Nick style structure.

2616
04:15:51.04 --> 04:15:54.88
Our daily structure informs us of what are we, what we are doing and when this is, of course,

2617
04:15:54.88 --> 04:15:59.44
created based on many of the objective, secure considerations and requirements. And like any

2618
04:15:59.44 --> 04:16:07.28
schedule, this provides us with some structure, a guide. And, and you got some cool examples of,

2619
04:16:07.28 --> 04:16:14.72
of your freaking schedule and stuff in here. I wanted to point this out cost of ambition.

2620
04:16:15.60 --> 04:16:21.92
We can quickly disregard those who genuinely don't want to see us succeed. They are relevant. So

2621
04:16:21.92 --> 04:16:28.40
there's no associated cost. The haters of the world suffer from insecurity. They lack confidence.

2622
04:16:28.40 --> 04:16:32.16
They look to tear down somebody rather than build themselves up because it's easier. They're weak,

2623
04:16:32.16 --> 04:16:40.96
ignore and move on easy. Our loved ones want our time because they love us in the onset.

2624
04:16:40.96 --> 04:16:45.76
They are genuinely supportive of the goal, cheering us on any way possible. Then the realization sets

2625
04:16:45.76 --> 04:16:49.76
in that in order to accomplish this mission, we are going to have to prioritize the task necessary

2626
04:16:49.76 --> 04:16:54.000
to reach the objective along the way. This takes time, time that is spent elsewhere. There's going

2627
04:16:54.000 --> 04:17:01.44
to be some friction here. Yeah, especially those that, you know, have spouses, kids. This is where

2628
04:17:01.44 --> 04:17:07.36
this is where this gets tough. Yeah. How old are your kids right now? Five and 16 months.

2629
04:17:07.36 --> 04:17:09.92
That's awesome. Freaking outstanding.

2630
04:17:12.80 --> 04:17:17.12
Fear. They don't want to see us disappointed. Manage your expectations. Don't get your hopes out.

2631
04:17:17.12 --> 04:17:22.000
Up. This is out of love. Big goals are inherently a long shot. We, we have accepted the fact that

2632
04:17:22.000 --> 04:17:25.28
there will always be failures along the way. We have accepted the fact that it's going to be painful.

2633
04:17:25.28 --> 04:17:32.88
Resentment. So it's good to think about that resentment. Number one, to make sure that you're

2634
04:17:32.88 --> 04:17:40.000
not getting caught up in it because this thing will eat you alive, man. And the biblical story of

2635
04:17:40.000 --> 04:17:46.96
Cain and Abel. I've talked about this a lot. Cain was so resentful of Abel that he literally killed

2636
04:17:46.96 --> 04:17:55.52
his brother. Just literally killed his brother. Right? We use the term brother in the most, the

2637
04:17:55.52 --> 04:18:00.48
strongest bond we can possibly have with another human. And this guy killed his brother because he

2638
04:18:00.48 --> 04:18:06.88
was resentful. So you got to watch out for it in yourself. And you've also got to watch out for

2639
04:18:06.88 --> 04:18:12.48
another people when those around us see our drive, our work ethic, our dedication, they too may feel

2640
04:18:12.48 --> 04:18:16.72
obligated to perform oftentimes as a positive chain reaction, accepted with gratitude and

2641
04:18:16.72 --> 04:18:23.04
resulting in output. This may also, however, have a negative response. It is not a catalyst for

2642
04:18:23.04 --> 04:18:28.000
performance. They can, they cannot refuse to reciprocate, which results in a feeling of laziness

2643
04:18:28.000 --> 04:18:32.64
or lack of ambition. Similarly, some have also attempted to achieve the goal themselves and

2644
04:18:32.64 --> 04:18:37.52
were defeated. Our success will affirm their inability to do the same in both cases, rather

2645
04:18:37.52 --> 04:18:42.88
than being a source of motivation, we can become a source of resentment. We must also be aware of

2646
04:18:42.88 --> 04:18:47.04
the flip side of the same coin when our ambition and determination are not reciprocated by those

2647
04:18:47.04 --> 04:18:52.48
around us, our loved ones, it can result in our resentment towards them. You got to watch out for

2648
04:18:52.48 --> 04:19:01.68
that one. Sneaky, sneaks up on you. You know, it's one of my buddies was trying to, Seth Stone was

2649
04:19:01.68 --> 04:19:07.44
trying to go, he's like, Hey, I want to go to, I want to go to Princeton. There was like a program

2650
04:19:07.44 --> 04:19:13.04
to go to Princeton while you're in the SEAL teams. And he asked me like, Hey, do you think I should

2651
04:19:13.04 --> 04:19:15.76
go? I was like, hell yeah, man. And he's like, Well, some of the other guys are telling me,

2652
04:19:15.76 --> 04:19:20.16
don't go, it's not going to be bad for my career. I was like, bro, how's it going to be bad for

2653
04:19:20.16 --> 04:19:25.92
your career to be a SEAL officer that went to freaking Princeton and has a degree in international

2654
04:19:25.92 --> 04:19:31.52
policy? Like who said that? And I think it's the same thing. People just didn't want him to get that

2655
04:19:31.52 --> 04:19:37.52
little extra little thing going on his life. A little resentment coming through. Yeah, maybe.

2656
04:19:37.52 --> 04:19:44.16
Watch out for that one. Community to put it bluntly, if we hang around with losers, we'll

2657
04:19:44.16 --> 04:19:51.60
become a loser. That one's kind of speaks for itself. I think the classic is you are the average

2658
04:19:51.60 --> 04:19:55.60
of the five you spend the most time with, you know, which I don't think is like statistically

2659
04:19:56.32 --> 04:20:01.44
accurate, but anecdotally and common sense wise, that makes sense to me. For sure. For sure.

2660
04:20:01.44 --> 04:20:07.44
And by again, I'm you've got all kinds of backing up data and stories and information to

2661
04:20:08.24 --> 04:20:12.08
to explain these things. I'm just trying to hit the high point so people know

2662
04:20:12.08 --> 04:20:16.96
that when they get this book, they're going to get a legitimate guide on how to do how to live.

2663
04:20:18.72 --> 04:20:24.80
Consistency, unfortunately, it's easy. It's easy to be great for a day. Anybody can do it. But the

2664
04:20:24.80 --> 04:20:30.08
other 364 days that make the difference. And this is truly the most challenging aspect of execution

2665
04:20:30.08 --> 04:20:37.44
consistency. That catches a lot of people off guard. Discipline, hard work and consistency.

2666
04:20:37.44 --> 04:20:41.44
How can you stop someone who is willing to stay on track, despite temptation,

2667
04:20:41.44 --> 04:20:44.96
someone who's willing to sacrifice and put in hard work, someone who's willing to dedicate

2668
04:20:44.96 --> 04:20:50.000
himself or her self on a daily basis? How can you stop someone who is willing to do whatever it

2669
04:20:50.000 --> 04:21:01.28
takes? The answer is you can't. Phase six track, there's no reason to over complicate this one.

2670
04:21:01.28 --> 04:21:05.52
It's simple. This is simply keeping track of what you are doing and how you are doing.

2671
04:21:06.08 --> 04:21:12.32
It's a diary really for for all my alpha tough guys out there. You will likely refer to this as a log.

2672
04:21:13.76 --> 04:21:17.44
But that's all it is. We are logging our actions, what we're doing, how we're doing it.

2673
04:21:17.44 --> 04:21:21.20
How what's the oldest log? You got logs from your freaking college workouts? Oh yeah,

2674
04:21:21.20 --> 04:21:29.84
go back decades. Yeah, yeah, old school. Yeah. I've got some, I've got some old, old. I have

2675
04:21:29.84 --> 04:21:34.64
the little right in the rain notebooks. And so I've got that I just always track a workout in.

2676
04:21:34.64 --> 04:21:46.80
And I've got probably, what is it 2022? I might have 15 years worth of I could pull up. I'm gonna

2677
04:21:46.80 --> 04:21:51.20
have to check that one. I pulled I had to pull it up. I really, we had a little situation unfold

2678
04:21:51.20 --> 04:21:59.60
that whole situation. Well, we, we, we, there was a guy that did a did a video about me being on

2679
04:21:59.60 --> 04:22:07.92
steroids and I've never done steroids. And you know, he kind of broke down. He had broken down

2680
04:22:07.92 --> 04:22:13.92
like what we had said on this one particular video where we were, we were kind of just having fun

2681
04:22:13.92 --> 04:22:20.80
and bullshit and back and forth and you know, talking about Echo's skinny knees. And a lot of

2682
04:22:20.80 --> 04:22:29.84
people sat down. And anyways, you know, this guy, his name, he's got a video, a thing called more

2683
04:22:29.84 --> 04:22:34.32
plates, more dates. Good, good dude. His name is Derek. Anyways, he made a video and he just did

2684
04:22:34.32 --> 04:22:38.80
like an assessment. I competed in jujitsu. I like he just did an assessment. It's like, oh yeah,

2685
04:22:38.80 --> 04:22:44.88
he's probably on TRT and probably juiced at one time. And I just, we just made one back and said

2686
04:22:44.88 --> 04:22:50.88
like, Hey, no, actually, I, I haven't. And I, I realized that there was things that I said

2687
04:22:52.000 --> 04:22:58.48
that made him think, well, oh, Jaco says he can, you know, squat 405 for 20 reps, which I kind of

2688
04:22:58.48 --> 04:23:03.44
like, I don't know if I actually said, yeah, or 10 reps or whatever it was. But I, I'd said it

2689
04:23:03.44 --> 04:23:07.28
bullshit with Echo on the podcast and was even a real podcast. We were just kind of like it was

2690
04:23:07.28 --> 04:23:12.32
before. So it was that I said, I worked out four times a day. Like there's some little clip where

2691
04:23:12.32 --> 04:23:17.12
I'm like, Oh, four times a day. And I had to clarify what I mean is like, Oh, on a good day,

2692
04:23:17.12 --> 04:23:23.92
I lift, I run, I go to jujitsu and I surf. Those are all some physical, those are all tiring, right?

2693
04:23:23.92 --> 04:23:30.40
But they're not like I didn't do some crazy workouts. So anyways, while we were doing that,

2694
04:23:30.40 --> 04:23:36.08
I kind of went back and just kind of reviewed, you know, just to get some real numbers out there

2695
04:23:36.08 --> 04:23:41.44
where I said, Hey, here's what, here's an actual number. This is the time. So that's why that's

2696
04:23:41.44 --> 04:23:47.28
like the last time. But I got just like stacks of these little notebooks, you know, but journaling.

2697
04:23:48.64 --> 04:23:53.20
You're talking about journaling over there, man. Yeah, man, some alpha males are going to get freaking

2698
04:23:53.20 --> 04:23:58.08
distraught. That's why I talk about it as much as I do. Because what are you going to do? You're

2699
04:23:58.08 --> 04:24:03.84
going to call me a bitch? I mean, really, really? You know, that's not like you go talking. It's

2700
04:24:03.84 --> 04:24:09.60
like one, I don't care. And two, like, okay, good luck with that. But like journaling, logging,

2701
04:24:09.60 --> 04:24:13.28
there's a huge part of my day to day. And I'm like, I'll scream that from the rooftops.

2702
04:24:13.84 --> 04:24:19.76
And it's always good. Like I, I since I track my since I write down, I can't track is a strong word

2703
04:24:19.76 --> 04:24:28.48
for me. But what I like about it is, over time, if you're not careful, you can start to, like,

2704
04:24:28.48 --> 04:24:33.04
let some things slide a little bit, you know, you like, Well, you know, I only really need to do

2705
04:24:33.04 --> 04:24:39.44
this or I only really do that. Or what could I actually do? This is good enough, I think. And

2706
04:24:40.000 --> 04:24:44.32
I had had this conversation with the Bert Soren from Soren X, you know, I'm talking about.

2707
04:24:45.52 --> 04:24:50.72
And I was like, man, there's exercises that I do just to make sure that I don't lose that capability,

2708
04:24:50.72 --> 04:24:56.32
like whatever it is, whatever that exercise is, muscle ups, like overhead squats, like I had a

2709
04:24:56.32 --> 04:25:02.000
hurt elbow for a year, man, I could not do an overhead squat, couldn't do it. Maybe it wasn't

2710
04:25:02.000 --> 04:25:08.32
a year. But you know, in my little logbook, it says elbow still hurt, you know, they can't do

2711
04:25:08.32 --> 04:25:14.32
overhead squats. So I know what's going on. I know why I'm not doing it. Those little things

2712
04:25:14.32 --> 04:25:21.04
to put in there, do you use any like the electronic tracking devices of your sleep or your, whatever?

2713
04:25:21.04 --> 04:25:25.76
No, not yet. No, not yet. I mean, the technology seems to make a lot of sense.

2714
04:25:25.76 --> 04:25:35.76
I haven't, I haven't found a gap yet where I may need to know that I got 6.125 hours of sleep at

2715
04:25:35.76 --> 04:25:42.64
75% efficiency. I think I don't know what difference it would make. Like it's time to get up, period.

2716
04:25:42.64 --> 04:25:47.52
So that's it. My watch says I only got, you know, 40% quality suite. It's like, it doesn't matter.

2717
04:25:47.52 --> 04:25:56.24
Yeah. Actually, I was talking to JP and he said, so he was doing my buddy JP and he said that he

2718
04:25:56.24 --> 04:26:01.92
started sort of his attitude would adjust based on what his, he stopped wearing it because it's,

2719
04:26:01.92 --> 04:26:07.12
it would say, oh, you need more rest. And he'd be like, oh, this workout's good. And he, and he

2720
04:26:07.12 --> 04:26:11.20
said, he took it off, bro. He was like, I'm not doing this. Cause it doesn't matter. Like you just

2721
04:26:11.20 --> 04:26:16.56
said, Hey, I'm up. This is the workout. I have to do. I'm going to go do it. When you see, hey,

2722
04:26:16.56 --> 04:26:22.08
you're only at 27% recovery. Man, come on. Start to feel it.

2723
04:26:26.000 --> 04:26:32.24
Phase seven, assess. This is where we analyze the state of our situation and identify areas of

2724
04:26:32.24 --> 04:26:40.16
progress stagnation and or regression. Again, how often are we going through life without actually

2725
04:26:40.16 --> 04:26:46.24
assessing where we're at? What's going on? What's our status? What adjustments do we need to make?

2726
04:26:47.44 --> 04:26:55.84
Like this seems so obvious, but guaranteed, guaranteed. I would actually say most people

2727
04:26:55.84 --> 04:27:01.20
aren't assessing where they're at. Maybe they do it. Oh, you know, when they do it is, what's the

2728
04:27:01.20 --> 04:27:07.44
new year, right? The new year. The resolution. Yeah. They're like, Hey, you know, I need to do this now.

2729
04:27:07.44 --> 04:27:14.48
But this is something you should be doing all the time. Where are you at? I used to tell the,

2730
04:27:14.48 --> 04:27:20.16
I used to trick though, when I taught the young junior officers, one of the little tricks I would

2731
04:27:20.16 --> 04:27:23.20
play, I'm going to say, what's the most important piece of information that you need on the battlefield?

2732
04:27:23.84 --> 04:27:27.36
And they would be like, where the enemy is, how many weapons they have, how many there are. And

2733
04:27:27.36 --> 04:27:31.84
I'd be like, no, the most important thing you need to know is where you are. So that's what

2734
04:27:31.84 --> 04:27:38.24
that's about. Assessment. Where are you at? So you can make changes to your course and get it

2735
04:27:38.24 --> 04:27:43.76
corrected. Honesty is what's critical with this, which a lot of us struggle with, man,

2736
04:27:43.76 --> 04:27:48.32
especially with social media, like what people project oftentimes isn't real.

2737
04:27:49.44 --> 04:27:55.44
And you get so conditioned to projecting this facade that you believe it yourself.

2738
04:27:55.44 --> 04:28:02.24
That's going to hurt. In order for this to have any kind of significance of value,

2739
04:28:02.24 --> 04:28:07.28
you need to have that internal no shit dialogue, where you can be honest with yourself. Like,

2740
04:28:07.28 --> 04:28:12.56
where am I currently at? Forget about my last Instagram post, which has 17 filters on it.

2741
04:28:12.56 --> 04:28:17.84
I took 57 different attempts for the perfect angle. Forget that. And your caption, that was very

2742
04:28:17.84 --> 04:28:22.64
enlightening. Sure, forget that. Like, look yourself in the mirror. Like, what is my current status?

2743
04:28:22.64 --> 04:28:26.24
And be honest with yourself. You're gonna bullshit yourself and forget about all this.

2744
04:28:26.24 --> 04:28:31.60
It's not going to matter. It's one thing that's nice about Jiu-Jitsu. You can't bullshit your partner.

2745
04:28:33.04 --> 04:28:39.44
It doesn't work. This just doesn't work. That's another reason for me. Like,

2746
04:28:39.44 --> 04:28:44.56
I have those logboots in my workout so I can say, man, you know what? I don't really need to do that.

2747
04:28:45.36 --> 04:28:49.60
Oh, wait a second. Let me look at what I see what I was doing two years ago. Oh, I was actually doing

2748
04:28:49.60 --> 04:28:56.32
this many reps or this many sets or whatever. And that's what it Oh, it keeps me keeps me honest,

2749
04:28:56.32 --> 04:29:03.44
actually. Absolutely. No, no. Um, phase eight repeat has the goal changed. If the answer is yes,

2750
04:29:03.44 --> 04:29:07.44
then repeat the process. That means go all the way back to the beginning and do this assessment.

2751
04:29:07.44 --> 04:29:12.48
Again, if the answer is no, repeat the process with specific and intentional adjustments based on

2752
04:29:12.48 --> 04:29:20.08
the identified lags or deficiencies, boom, execute back to work, move out, continue to gather the

2753
04:29:20.08 --> 04:29:25.28
data, stay the course, trust the process. We cannot make brash decisions. Odds are there are

2754
04:29:25.28 --> 04:29:30.96
variables within our equation that are working. The only way to determine what is creating positive

2755
04:29:30.96 --> 04:29:37.12
effects is through small incremental adjustments over time. It's hard. This separates the average

2756
04:29:37.12 --> 04:29:43.84
from the greats. If it were easy, everybody would do it. Repeat, repeat, repeat. The process

2757
04:29:43.84 --> 04:29:53.92
does not stop focus. It is worth it. So again, those were the highlights to this.

2758
04:29:55.28 --> 04:30:06.16
This guide, this, this methodology, the sort of military, the military planning wrapped around

2759
04:30:06.16 --> 04:30:12.48
what you could use for everyday life. Freaking legit, man. Thank you. Freaking legit.

2760
04:30:14.96 --> 04:30:19.92
So that's kind of, that kind of gets us up to speed, right? How, how many years you've been

2761
04:30:19.92 --> 04:30:26.24
in the army for right now? 15. I guess you're going to stay for 20. At this point, man,

2762
04:30:26.64 --> 04:30:31.52
it would have to take something real convincing to get me out of here. How to know what the hell

2763
04:30:31.52 --> 04:30:37.68
would get you out of here at this point. You got any, are you starting to look at what you

2764
04:30:37.68 --> 04:30:43.04
might do after the military? Yeah. So I mean, it's, I'm going to continue to write because,

2765
04:30:43.04 --> 04:30:47.44
again, I found out that I actually enjoy it. So I got a few projects I kind of work on. Well,

2766
04:30:47.44 --> 04:30:54.88
you did spend seven years in college. So you got some experience at it. Got some lessons learned.

2767
04:30:54.88 --> 04:31:05.28
Yeah. A little bit. So continue to write because I enjoy it. And then I'm not working for anybody

2768
04:31:05.28 --> 04:31:11.36
else ever again. After 20 years, I'll work with a lot of people, but I'm going to choose who I work

2769
04:31:11.36 --> 04:31:18.000
with. But the days of people telling me what to do will be over once I get that DD 214 in my hands.

2770
04:31:18.000 --> 04:31:27.52
And so I see myself doing consulting, speaking, workshop, seminar type stuff. And I got a small

2771
04:31:28.48 --> 04:31:34.96
crew around me now that are in line with that successful buddies of mine and some family that

2772
04:31:37.44 --> 04:31:43.36
are doing well in life, but feel unfulfilled. My buddies, they work for Salesforce and they

2773
04:31:43.36 --> 04:31:50.16
make a ton of cash. They live in Manhattan. Wow, they successful. But it's like, do I want to look

2774
04:31:50.16 --> 04:31:55.12
back on my death bed at 80 and been like, I sold a lot of software and I had a really nice house.

2775
04:31:55.12 --> 04:31:59.60
Or do I want to do something to sink my teeth into something that I'm proud of that gives me

2776
04:31:59.60 --> 04:32:05.20
some fulfillment. So just turning that into a from what is now a nights and weekends kind of

2777
04:32:05.20 --> 04:32:12.24
side thing to just what I do full time. Where will you raise your family once you get out?

2778
04:32:12.24 --> 04:32:18.80
It's a good question. My wife and I have in this conversation right now. I would like to go back up

2779
04:32:18.80 --> 04:32:28.000
north. But I want land as well. So I'd like to be able to live ideal for me maybe as like western

2780
04:32:28.000 --> 04:32:32.40
or central mass where I can get my family because it's all about what culture don't want to raise

2781
04:32:32.40 --> 04:32:37.68
my kids in. That's the conversation her and I are having. I think that there's a lot of value. I grew

2782
04:32:37.68 --> 04:32:44.16
up in more of an urban environment where there's the edgy fast thinking wittiness that comes.

2783
04:32:44.16 --> 04:32:47.68
The expression is with New York. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere because it's

2784
04:32:47.68 --> 04:32:53.04
tough. You take someone from that environment, that culture, put them into a much slower environment

2785
04:32:53.04 --> 04:32:56.96
like Tennessee where I'm at now. Yeah, they'll probably be frustrated because things are moving

2786
04:32:56.96 --> 04:33:01.52
at a slower pace, but they're going to do well because they can move fast and talk fast and

2787
04:33:01.52 --> 04:33:06.56
think fast. Where if you take someone who grew up in some, you know, backwards area and threw them

2788
04:33:06.56 --> 04:33:12.56
in Manhattan, they're just overwhelmed by events. So I'd like to really give my kids a taste of that

2789
04:33:13.76 --> 04:33:18.000
high tempo environment, but I don't want to necessarily like live in that environment.

2790
04:33:18.000 --> 04:33:24.08
Yeah, I think there's a good, if you can get somehow, get both those, get your kids in both

2791
04:33:24.08 --> 04:33:28.96
those environments where they spend some time where they're like in the city scenario and they

2792
04:33:28.96 --> 04:33:34.88
spend some times where they're out in the country scenario. Because you know, you also have those

2793
04:33:34.88 --> 04:33:40.48
kids that like they're out in the field and there's like a rattlesnake and they just like grab a stick,

2794
04:33:40.48 --> 04:33:43.76
you know, hold the things head down, pick it up, swing it up against the tree and kill it, you

2795
04:33:43.76 --> 04:33:50.000
know, you're like, that's pretty legit. Absolutely. So you get, you can, and you can kids are, their

2796
04:33:50.000 --> 04:33:55.84
minds don't get developed even remotely to the capacity that they've got, you know. So if you

2797
04:33:55.84 --> 04:34:00.64
can get a little bit of that, both, you know, you get them in the city sometimes where they're

2798
04:34:00.64 --> 04:34:05.04
comfortable with that, you get them in the country sometimes where they're comfortable with that.

2799
04:34:05.04 --> 04:34:11.04
I think that, I think that's optimal. You know, same thing, man. Got some space, you know, get a

2800
04:34:11.04 --> 04:34:16.64
little range set up out there, some quiet, some lands, made TVs, some, you know, some hiking

2801
04:34:16.64 --> 04:34:20.88
trails, do some outdoorsy stuff. But then, you know, I'm two and a half, three hours outside of

2802
04:34:20.88 --> 04:34:24.80
Boston where I can go in. Yeah, you need, you might need to go to New Hampshire or Maine or

2803
04:34:24.80 --> 04:34:27.76
something for that kind of scenario. I could see that. Because I can't, I don't see you having a

2804
04:34:27.76 --> 04:34:34.88
range anywhere in your backyard in Massachusetts. Is that even possible? Legally? It might be tough.

2805
04:34:36.56 --> 04:34:42.80
It might be tough if you had the land. But that type of dynamic, I think, is the goal for both of us.

2806
04:34:42.80 --> 04:34:49.28
Right. Right. But you got to have, you also have, man, you got some roots in Boston, man,

2807
04:34:49.28 --> 04:34:53.92
where you want them to have. You want them to have a Boston accent? I try to indoctrinate them

2808
04:34:53.92 --> 04:34:59.04
into that now, you know. And they, you know, my oldest is five. He doesn't have, I'd say, a Tennessee

2809
04:34:59.04 --> 04:35:04.000
accent yet, but he uses some of the vernacular down there, you know, the y'all and the, and the

2810
04:35:04.000 --> 04:35:08.88
whatever. And I'll correct him on how to pronounce words with an accent, you know, because he's

2811
04:35:08.88 --> 04:35:14.24
learning how to read and write. And he's like, you know, C-A-I, he's like, you know, car. And I'm

2812
04:35:14.24 --> 04:35:22.80
like, it's car. Say it again, car. He's like, no, dad, it's car. I'm like, negative. It's car. My

2813
04:35:22.80 --> 04:35:28.24
wife is like, would you leave him alone? Where's your wife from originally? Milwaukee. They kind of

2814
04:35:28.24 --> 04:35:33.68
have not much of an accent, right? It's kind of like a Chicago thing. It's a little Chicago. It's

2815
04:35:33.68 --> 04:35:38.64
like, yeah, don't you know, it's kind of like Minnesota, Minnesota thing, Southern Canada type

2816
04:35:38.64 --> 04:35:46.80
thing. Hers isn't isn't really that thick. Some of her family is right on. Awesome, man. I think

2817
04:35:46.80 --> 04:35:52.32
that's probably a pretty good place. Echo Charles. Yes, sir. You got any questions?

2818
04:35:52.32 --> 04:35:55.60
Well, I was going to ask about Jiu Jitsu, but we kind of talked about it, you know,

2819
04:35:55.60 --> 04:36:00.08
why would you want to ask? Just, you know, how's the training? When are you getting back to training?

2820
04:36:00.08 --> 04:36:04.72
Because your shoulder and stuff, right? Yeah, man, I'm probably another eight, nine weeks out

2821
04:36:04.72 --> 04:36:09.20
before the docs will clear me from that. And there'll be a slow progression back. But I'm not

2822
04:36:09.20 --> 04:36:17.20
trained in Jiu Jitsu like I used to. I did deprioritize it where I was real heavy into it and competing

2823
04:36:17.20 --> 04:36:23.44
and like real aggressive and like enhancing my skill and my technical capacity. Now I get in

2824
04:36:23.44 --> 04:36:27.44
there a couple days a week just to just to keep a finger on the pulse and enjoy it kind of open

2825
04:36:27.44 --> 04:36:33.60
mat style. And I help with the instruction of my son who's in Jiu Jitsu now. That's one. Yeah,

2826
04:36:33.60 --> 04:36:38.64
that's kind of a natural progression for a lot of people, right? Especially when you get kids and,

2827
04:36:38.64 --> 04:36:41.76
you know, all this stuff. It's like, you keep Jiu Jitsu, but you

2828
04:36:41.76 --> 04:36:47.04
you deprioritize it a little bit. Yeah, that makes sense. How's your kid like Jiu Jitsu?

2829
04:36:47.04 --> 04:36:53.12
He struggles with it a bit because it's there's a lot of free time where they're trying to teach

2830
04:36:53.12 --> 04:36:57.36
some real technical stuff. And he doesn't do well when he's told to just sit there and like pay

2831
04:36:57.36 --> 04:37:04.08
attention. He's five. He's five. I very seldom because I taught kids classes for a long time.

2832
04:37:04.08 --> 04:37:09.76
Now, including my own kids classes. If five is really young, man, it's almost like when they're

2833
04:37:09.76 --> 04:37:15.20
five, you should have a half an hour class. Because you just get them out there and keep it fun.

2834
04:37:15.84 --> 04:37:21.36
They already know how to wrestle. Like it's it's it's a natural thing. So if you just say put some

2835
04:37:21.36 --> 04:37:26.80
rules around what they already know, some very basic rules, they'll have fun. And the funner,

2836
04:37:26.80 --> 04:37:31.36
you can make it man, the better off you're going to be. And you know, I'm sure you've heard me

2837
04:37:31.36 --> 04:37:35.20
talk about this before, but like I pushed you to too hard on my kids when they were younger,

2838
04:37:35.20 --> 04:37:42.40
like competing. They trained seven days a week. That's a lot. Yeah, seven days a week. And we

2839
04:37:42.40 --> 04:37:46.80
were just I was just talking about with my kids the other day. It'd be like on Saturday, we'd get

2840
04:37:46.80 --> 04:37:51.92
hit we'd get to this gym at eight o'clock in the morning. And like I would teach their striking

2841
04:37:51.92 --> 04:37:56.08
class. And then I'd bring them up and teach their jiu-jitsu class. And then I would train

2842
04:37:56.88 --> 04:38:04.000
for two hours or two and a half hours. So they'd be here. Just in this gym, ages like five through

2843
04:38:04.000 --> 04:38:15.76
eight for like five, six hours Saturday and Sunday. That's aggressive. It's not the best protocol.

2844
04:38:15.76 --> 04:38:20.16
That's aggressive. I would have been done a better job. Now look, they're coming back to it. I mean,

2845
04:38:20.16 --> 04:38:24.08
one of my daughters is like training. She trained more than that right now. You know, she's getting

2846
04:38:24.08 --> 04:38:28.64
after an echo nose. Yes, sir. Echo almost lost his arm to her the other day. She was getting hostile.

2847
04:38:28.64 --> 04:38:32.40
Every time I come in here, she's here. Yeah. No matter what time, by the way. How old is she?

2848
04:38:32.40 --> 04:38:39.52
21. Oh yeah. But she wrestled in high school and stuff. She's down for the cause. But yeah,

2849
04:38:39.52 --> 04:38:44.96
you can't get two. You gotta let you gotta make them love it. Yeah. We scaled it back. It was

2850
04:38:44.96 --> 04:38:49.76
twice a week. And now we're doing like one. And then we brought in some gymnastics. And he does

2851
04:38:49.76 --> 04:38:53.36
like this little CrossFit like a class thing. It's just it's just there's more movement

2852
04:38:53.36 --> 04:38:56.72
hell yeah with those things, which is good for him. Well, this was the main point I want to make.

2853
04:38:57.44 --> 04:39:01.76
My son had a friend because I would like try and get every kid in the neighborhood to train jiu-jitsu.

2854
04:39:01.76 --> 04:39:06.56
And my son had a friend who I brought him in. We was five. He hated it. I brought him in when

2855
04:39:06.56 --> 04:39:12.40
like literally a year later, he was six, hated it. He was seven, hated it. He was eight, hated it.

2856
04:39:12.40 --> 04:39:16.24
And finally when he was like nine, all of a sudden it clicked and he was like, Oh, I understand

2857
04:39:16.24 --> 04:39:20.72
what all this means and what this could help me with. And it, you know, and he started training

2858
04:39:20.72 --> 04:39:27.44
all the time. And it wasn't like he was then five years behind my son. You know what I mean?

2859
04:39:27.44 --> 04:39:31.60
Like the kids are only going to learn so much and they can learn so rapidly that once they get

2860
04:39:31.60 --> 04:39:36.40
engulfed in it, they'll catch up pretty quick. So you don't have to worry like, this is a wasted

2861
04:39:36.40 --> 04:39:42.96
year. Go freaking full, go freaking full Nick Lavery on him like, you missed a training opportunity,

2862
04:39:42.96 --> 04:39:47.76
son. That's a good, that's actually a good point. Yeah. Cause they'll be able to make up for it.

2863
04:39:47.76 --> 04:39:53.92
And if they, if they're into it, man, that's worth, that's worth it. Look, we can find you.

2864
04:39:53.92 --> 04:40:01.84
People can find you machine Nick.com. That's it. You're, you have a YouTube channel. You have

2865
04:40:01.84 --> 04:40:13.44
Instagram, which is Nick at Nick.machine.lavery. Lavery is L A V E R Y. Any closing thoughts, Nick?

2866
04:40:16.08 --> 04:40:20.96
I appreciate the invitation, man. I, you're in this book. You didn't, you didn't read the pots

2867
04:40:20.96 --> 04:40:26.48
where I mentioned you personally. Dude, I totally appreciate it. It feels weird. I bet it does.

2868
04:40:26.48 --> 04:40:32.000
No, it's fine. But just a level of gratitude to the lessons I learned from you and from these

2869
04:40:32.000 --> 04:40:41.12
works. You know, once I did realize that leadership is as a skill, although some people may be

2870
04:40:42.48 --> 04:40:48.72
genetically enhanced based on character traits, it's a skill that requires reps like anything else.

2871
04:40:48.72 --> 04:40:55.44
And you were the first dude that I found the first mentor I found when I realized that I had that gap

2872
04:40:55.44 --> 04:41:01.92
and that there was a difference and I drove down that road. So a lot of my operational and personal

2873
04:41:01.92 --> 04:41:08.72
successes are from your works and the way you message that. So I'm a, I'm a fan. So it's an

2874
04:41:08.72 --> 04:41:13.04
honor to be here and just spend some time with you, man. So I appreciate it. No, that's awesome.

2875
04:41:13.04 --> 04:41:23.36
And, um, you know, my last job in the SEAL teams was running training and there was so rewarding.

2876
04:41:23.36 --> 04:41:28.40
I kind of already mentioned it, but having guys come back from combat and say, hey, we got out

2877
04:41:28.40 --> 04:41:36.000
of this situation because of what you taught us and now having been doing this stuff, you know,

2878
04:41:36.000 --> 04:41:42.88
the amount of feedback that I get like that, man, it's just, it feels good to pass that information

2879
04:41:42.88 --> 04:41:49.04
on and you're going to get the same feedback, you know, on your story, on the lessons you learned,

2880
04:41:49.04 --> 04:41:55.12
on the methodology you put forth in your book. So I appreciate you taking that and, and running with

2881
04:41:55.12 --> 04:42:02.08
it. And it, that's, that's what we got to do, you know, we got to take care of the next generation.

2882
04:42:02.08 --> 04:42:07.12
So I appreciate it, man. That means a lot. And yes, it was a little, I did purposely avoid the

2883
04:42:07.12 --> 04:42:16.48
parts of the book. But all good, man. I want to read one last thing. Just because I think it's

2884
04:42:16.48 --> 04:42:20.48
closes out the message really solid from the book. I was not genetically gifted with any

2885
04:42:20.48 --> 04:42:26.32
astonishing talents. I don't come from a family of wealth. I make mistakes constantly. I lose focus.

2886
04:42:26.32 --> 04:42:32.72
I procrastinate. I waste time. I feel pain. I experience fear. I bleed. I am not cut from a

2887
04:42:32.72 --> 04:42:39.92
different cloth. I am not from another planet. I am a human, same as you, which means we have

2888
04:42:39.92 --> 04:42:46.16
the ability to choose. It doesn't matter what we do for a living, how much money we have in the bank,

2889
04:42:46.16 --> 04:42:51.92
the size of our house, the disability we live with, who we care for, who cares for us, the car we

2890
04:42:51.92 --> 04:43:00.24
drive, if we have a car at all, how popular we are, or how much we can bench. It does not matter.

2891
04:43:00.24 --> 04:43:11.04
We must simply decide. This is what I believe. This is who I am going to become. And I am willing

2892
04:43:11.04 --> 04:43:23.76
to put it all on the line to achieve it. So there you go, man. You live in proof of those words.

2893
04:43:23.76 --> 04:43:31.52
Thanks for joining us, man. Thanks for sharing your story, your strategies for victory.

2894
04:43:32.80 --> 04:43:40.32
And most important, thank you for your continued service and sacrifice. You set an example for

2895
04:43:40.32 --> 04:43:45.12
all of us. And the next generation that's coming up is going to be looking at you and knowing

2896
04:43:45.12 --> 04:43:55.12
that they can get things done. And it's an example, not just how to live, but how to live right.

2897
04:43:55.68 --> 04:44:02.80
So thanks, brother. I appreciate it, bro. And with that, Nick, slavery, the machine

2898
04:44:03.84 --> 04:44:11.36
has left the building appropriate, fully appropriate, right? Yes. You're not like, well,

2899
04:44:11.36 --> 04:44:20.80
that's no. What a freaking stud, man. In the classic Hackworth sense of the word. You know

2900
04:44:20.80 --> 04:44:25.76
what, Hackworth? Yeah, no. That's the way he describes his two categories of people.

2901
04:44:28.40 --> 04:44:35.76
Studs and duds. Hopeless in the hard part. But like, like the most, the best thing he can describe,

2902
04:44:35.76 --> 04:44:42.64
he goes, this guy was a stud. That's like his big, his big statement. But yeah, man, Nick,

2903
04:44:42.64 --> 04:44:55.04
just amazing human out there, crushing. And what a beast, man. Here's a small point of contention,

2904
04:44:56.000 --> 04:45:02.48
which you just alluded to before you hit record. He says he has no, not genetically gifted.

2905
04:45:02.48 --> 04:45:07.12
He's a little bit too many. I was going to chime in. You were sounding good. I was like, well,

2906
04:45:08.40 --> 04:45:15.20
you are a monster. Yeah. He's a, he's a massive monster of a human being. Yeah. And then,

2907
04:45:15.20 --> 04:45:21.20
but then I was thinking about that. 300 pounds as a bouncer. How tall he say he was? Six, five.

2908
04:45:21.20 --> 04:45:24.96
Six, five. He said he shot up to six, five. I was looking at him. I'm evaluating, I'm thinking

2909
04:45:24.96 --> 04:45:32.40
six, five, six, six. That's what I'm thinking. Not a small human. No, giant. And you can get by,

2910
04:45:32.40 --> 04:45:39.68
you can get by with that in life. But then you can go to the next level. Yeah. And he's not like a

2911
04:45:39.68 --> 04:45:44.64
sloppy, like two, you know, even how big he is, he's not like a, and I'm not saying all because

2912
04:45:44.64 --> 04:45:48.24
it's, I'm not saying that, but there's a difference between just being big and sort of lurchy and

2913
04:45:48.24 --> 04:45:54.88
maybe sloppy and like a six, five stud as it were. See what I'm saying? And he was for sure that.

2914
04:45:54.88 --> 04:46:00.88
So I can imagine him eating with a diet coach and all this stuff. Yeah. I didn't do a good job.

2915
04:46:00.88 --> 04:46:08.24
I didn't do a good job of capturing the fact of like the discipline that he imposes in his life

2916
04:46:08.24 --> 04:46:13.28
to achieve these goals. Look, it kind of is clear that you have to, but you know, he's, you know,

2917
04:46:13.28 --> 04:46:16.24
this, how many calories I'm eating at this time. This is what I'm doing here. This is the workout

2918
04:46:16.24 --> 04:46:23.52
on this, the stretching, this is mobility. This is the time, you know, 0400 Reveley, 0428, you know,

2919
04:46:23.52 --> 04:46:33.28
in the gym, 0521 starting cardio, 0610 first calorie intake, 700 via egg, you know, like that

2920
04:46:33.28 --> 04:46:39.28
kind of thing. Bro, he said something or the one part that really I was like, bro, that's so true.

2921
04:46:39.28 --> 04:46:42.88
If you can just remember that because, you know, he mentioned tunnel vision at one point, he

2922
04:46:42.88 --> 04:46:46.80
mentioned tunnel vision, right? About when he was just thinking about his own goals kind of thing.

2923
04:46:46.80 --> 04:46:52.16
I was like, bro, I think that that's like an asset, that tunnel vision, because that's really a big

2924
04:46:52.16 --> 04:46:56.56
part of what discipline is, is not getting distracted by other stuff, including like your

2925
04:46:56.56 --> 04:47:00.000
own feelings, right? So you guys, both of you guys are talking about like, when you wake up in the

2926
04:47:00.000 --> 04:47:04.000
morning, you just do it, you're not distracted about how you feel, how much sleep you may or

2927
04:47:04.000 --> 04:47:08.32
may not have gotten, you know, the weather or all this stuff, whatever. You're just not distracted

2928
04:47:08.32 --> 04:47:13.36
by that. You just sort of do it, right? So technically, distraction is kind of the main

2929
04:47:13.36 --> 04:47:17.68
enemy of discipline. And he mentioned it. I was like, I was just like tunnel vision. I was like,

2930
04:47:17.68 --> 04:47:22.24
yeah, that is, huh? If you can maintain tunnel vision and leverage that, bro, you can kind of do

2931
04:47:22.24 --> 04:47:27.04
anything. And this is the part where I was like, bro, that's so true. I hope to remember this

2932
04:47:28.40 --> 04:47:32.16
at times that'll benefit me, where he was like, he was talking about getting in and out of the

2933
04:47:33.12 --> 04:47:37.20
vehicle, right? Where he's like having trouble. So he's just practicing. He's like, if I can do this

2934
04:47:37.20 --> 04:47:41.44
a thousand times, I'll be good. I'll be good. Good to do. Yeah, I'll be good. And I was like,

2935
04:47:41.44 --> 04:47:46.56
bro, that's so true. And, you know, and we know it like we know it, but it's like, okay, so you

2936
04:47:46.56 --> 04:47:53.36
need these guys like, uh, what's the group, the acrobat group, like a Cirque du Soleil or something

2937
04:47:53.36 --> 04:47:58.64
or, you know, whatever you called it. Yeah. And they do these things. You're like, how the heck

2938
04:47:58.64 --> 04:48:03.04
can they just nail that? It's so precise or whatever. But then you think about it in those

2939
04:48:03.04 --> 04:48:06.56
terms where if it's like, yeah, let me do this a thousand times, let me do this 10,000 times.

2940
04:48:06.56 --> 04:48:09.76
Let me do this. I mean, probably even more than that. Just do it that many times. And it's just

2941
04:48:09.76 --> 04:48:13.84
so automatic, just like anything else you do, not anything else, but like a lot of stuff you

2942
04:48:13.84 --> 04:48:18.88
already do as a human, like walking. Probably you ever consider about what your body has to do

2943
04:48:18.88 --> 04:48:23.36
to just stand up and walk like your little feet and all this stuff. So it's like, man, you just

2944
04:48:23.36 --> 04:48:27.92
got to put it into perspective. It's like, yeah, you just apply that to like kind of hard stuff.

2945
04:48:27.92 --> 04:48:30.80
And probably you can do it, but you got to maintain that tunnel vision though in a way.

2946
04:48:30.80 --> 04:48:35.44
Yeah. And the tunnel vision you got to watch out for because he got tunnel vision just focused

2947
04:48:35.44 --> 04:48:42.32
on himself. But I, what I liked the power when he was like, oh, when it was about me, he was

2948
04:48:42.32 --> 04:48:48.16
working hard. When he realized it was about his teammates and his teammates, kids and wives.

2949
04:48:48.88 --> 04:48:53.68
He's like, I can get another freaking rep. Watch this. You know what I'm saying? So

2950
04:48:55.04 --> 04:49:03.60
you know, you are much less likely to allow yourself to let your friend down than to let

2951
04:49:03.60 --> 04:49:07.36
yourself down. You know, that's why people need a workout buddy, right? Like, Hey, are you going

2952
04:49:07.36 --> 04:49:10.40
to be there? Yeah, I'm going to be there. You don't want to let your friend down. So you show up.

2953
04:49:10.40 --> 04:49:16.32
They recommend that if you're having trouble getting it done, get a workout buddy. So he had that

2954
04:49:16.32 --> 04:49:25.92
like amplified times 1000 because it's him wanting to be able to execute the job to take care of his

2955
04:49:25.92 --> 04:49:34.72
teammates. That's what this is about. So freaking neck. Awesome. Awesome guy, man. Just an awesome

2956
04:49:34.72 --> 04:49:43.12
guy. Hey, look, no matter where you are in life, you know, you can do a little bit better. Nick is

2957
04:49:44.88 --> 04:49:48.72
good example to all of us. You know, I could probably do a little bit better.

2958
04:49:49.28 --> 04:49:54.56
Everything that I do, every single thing that I, Jocko willing do is a little bit easier for me,

2959
04:49:54.56 --> 04:49:59.76
because I got two freaking legs. Can you imagine jumping off a four foot thing in order to be

2960
04:49:59.76 --> 04:50:04.000
able to do your job that you want to do? You jump off this four foot platform, you got to land in a

2961
04:50:04.000 --> 04:50:09.28
pistol with another random prosthetic legs sticking out and stick the land and stick it.

2962
04:50:09.28 --> 04:50:15.44
By the way, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. So what, you know, they said in the book, if you're

2963
04:50:15.44 --> 04:50:19.52
around Nick, you have no excuses. Well, we're around Nick, man. Nick's out there. Think about that

2964
04:50:19.52 --> 04:50:24.32
right now. So Nick's out there. So the pistol squat thing, sticking the landing, jumping off the

2965
04:50:24.32 --> 04:50:29.36
four foot thing, sticking landing in a pistol, pistol squad. Even if you're not that like,

2966
04:50:30.000 --> 04:50:37.84
impressed with that, what if you were six, five freaking two, you know, two 15, one leg though,

2967
04:50:37.84 --> 04:50:42.16
seem saying like you would have been two 50, the equivalent of like a two 50 seem saying now do it.

2968
04:50:43.92 --> 04:50:49.36
Way more impressive. So we're doing better. If you want to do better, you're going to need to

2969
04:50:49.36 --> 04:50:52.08
work. If you're going to do work, you're going to need to recover. If you need to recover, you need

2970
04:50:52.08 --> 04:50:56.32
the right fuel. You need the right fuel to work sometimes. I want some fuel right now, some

2971
04:50:56.32 --> 04:51:05.76
jockel fuel. I drink some go. It feels good. I feel good. So jockel fuel.com. You can get some fuel.

2972
04:51:07.28 --> 04:51:12.16
Supplementation, supplementation. You can get MOLC. You can get joint warfare.

2973
04:51:13.68 --> 04:51:17.60
Go read the reviews on joint warfare and then press click order because it makes you feel

2974
04:51:17.60 --> 04:51:24.40
good. Yeah, way better. I had a jujitsu sash that was slightly more intense than maybe I was

2975
04:51:24.40 --> 04:51:29.76
I was used to or whatever. No, no problem. But my elbow and shoulder. So I had to double up the

2976
04:51:29.76 --> 04:51:37.04
joint warfare. It's a good move. Hey, that's my life, man. Energy drinks, which we use the term

2977
04:51:38.000 --> 04:51:42.56
in its own category separate from the poison that you may have been drinking. This is energy

2978
04:51:42.56 --> 04:51:46.88
drinks that are good for you actually give you energy and now they taste good. They may not have

2979
04:51:46.88 --> 04:51:52.40
tasted. They might have been not. They may not have been to your liking before. Now they will be.

2980
04:51:52.40 --> 04:51:58.64
We fixed it. We took input. We're not over here like no, no, we took input wanted to taste better.

2981
04:51:58.64 --> 04:52:01.68

2985
04:52:17.36 --> 04:52:23.04
with Nick about jujitsu, but he did. He did talk about how jujitsu was like a huge part of his

2986
04:52:23.04 --> 04:52:29.76
recovery and what he did. You should be doing jujitsu and you may, you may have previous to

2987
04:52:29.76 --> 04:52:34.64
this podcast had some kind of an excuse as to why you couldn't drain because you have this and you

2988
04:52:34.64 --> 04:52:43.04
have that and you have the other thing. So you don't have an excuse anymore. Nick was a white belt.

2989
04:52:43.04 --> 04:52:48.16
He didn't have, he doesn't have a leg and he got his black belt and competed by the way and and

2990
04:52:48.16 --> 04:52:54.88
competed. So yeah, yeah. And that and so come on. There's a, as far as like, you know, you want to go

2991
04:52:54.88 --> 04:53:00.96
hard into jujitsu, there's different levels, which to me are 100% all of them are 100% acceptable.

3051
04:59:00.32 --> 04:59:07.52
everybody else out there, just remember what Nick had to say when he's talking about the fact in his

3052
04:59:07.52 --> 04:59:14.48
book that he's not from a rich family. He's not genetically gifted, which that's a little bit

3053
04:59:14.48 --> 04:59:25.60
of contention behind that. But listen, we know this, he's now been physically put into a situation

3054
04:59:25.60 --> 04:59:30.80
where it certainly was not a gift. So he's in a situation right now that's more challenging

3055
04:59:30.80 --> 04:59:38.32
