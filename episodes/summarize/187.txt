The best leaders they're completely comfortable doing that because they know what their guy's going to do because they have trained them so hard they have to do that situation so many times that they're because for all the cast that is definitely going to ensue he's extremely he knows exactly what his guy's going to do and how they're going to react. You can't just be awesome at one thing you can't just be all about the signs of these things and when you usually work creativity when you see people do things like that and it's like it's like artistry you see just the flow and the maneuvers and the things that are coming in and I'm sure that that first the five of six when he said do it. This is what's happened and it's going, we know it's going to happen and I don't know where it's going to happen again for sure. Do it and knowing what's going to happen you know well, but beyond what what people can see it in real time and knowing that you can't know what's going to happen for sure. So I'm going to make these incremental decisions that are going to lead me toward my final objective, but it's going to it's going to prevent me from getting stagnant and waiting and not gaining any new information. and people sometimes forget the golf war was like four days you know the the sustain combat operations was like 96 hours something like that. You know, going back to the patches with me and life, you know, hey, I'm not going to expend a bunch of leadership capital in the fact that you are wearing these patches. You know are we really going to fight another like actual war are we really going to do that? Oh, like there's going to be things that aren't going the way I'm going to say that when you get up on the high ground and you look around, you can see things that other people aren't going to see and you can make really good decisions. And next thing you know that that that event completely fueled the insurgency for sure that tiny tactical that people like tiny tactical event had massive think of how many enemy fighters that recruited and made our job strategically that much harder. And when you see it, you're going to have to step and you're going to have to make that decision and there's going to be risking that decision. Instead of me going, hey, man, can you explain to me, I want to understand how you're going to execute this thing, because it's important for me to understand what you're thinking. but they had 50 armor pieces that drink like diesel like what do you think they get to I mean it's just something it's just something completely crazy probably two miles to the gallon or something like that. Like I would be looking at the battle map going into on my first deployment, we'd be going into some random town. Obviously, that's a really good thing, but you can't be like that all the time, because if you're overaggressive and you've been wrong opportunity or you're actually so aggressive that you haven't had a chance to bring all your forces to bear when actually is most effective. That's when he kind of, when I got to know that he said, oh, I think this is what people from a leadership perspective, if you have a deterministic viewpoint of leadership, hey, when the person does this, oh, here's the prescription for that. But when you're, and then I told them, you know, when we were going through this training, it was like this for me every time. Yeah, and leaders will create this scenario by which, okay, if I, if I acquiesce on that one little thing, that's a weakness and they're going to see that I don't hold the line on that and so it's going to infect everything else. When I looked back at my first deployment to Iraq, once we were in Romadi for like a month, I realized, because my first deployment we'd be going all over the place, you know, we did a lot of work in Baghdad, but Baghdad is huge. I'm going to subtly and smoothly point out the little mistakes in the plan that you had and I'm going to actually let you come to the conclusion. I read these books and I listen to the podcast and it's only hard for me to even try to relate to the idea that I was in combat in an airplane, you know, given what these things sound like. If you over and over again, I'm I'm going to just roll over when you say that and it's going to make it worse for me, but there are times that actually the frontal assault does work. And what's even going to drive these people into a worse situation from a leadership perspective is they're going to realize that you don't care about them. So when we're working with, when we are working with a company at echelon front, it seems like oftentimes what people learn about business, like let's say they get their MBA from somewhere or they even if they've gone through some kind of a program, whatever kind of program. The things that I would see now the things that I would know to look for now that I didn't even think of then and what you just said that that that last comment that that's everywhere that that that that training p all the pieces of the go into that and any one of them without the other doesn't work. And they know that what's required is actually going to learn the tactics that you will apply as an artillery man or an infantry man or a supply officer or a legislation. You know, 1971 like if you joined if you got to the field teams in 1971 or 1972 you didn't you know you didn't go to Vietnam. That was my main effort for like, you know, I actually it was the main effort when I was editing. One thing we know is if we develop leaders and we start to get on the path, it's going to develop in a great way. It didn't really occurred to me till years later talking, you know, conversation we had about when the seals are trying to introduce goggles and guys like, hey, we don't need that kind of stuff. He's actually looking up and seeing this is the reaction that I'm going to get this is what's going to happen. And I'm like, I'm like, hey, bro, and he's like, what's up, sir? Because when we win this war, our kids don't have to go to war and we're going to have stability, we're going to have security. The answer is, if you, if what, if I'm going to have a conversation with you and it's going to move our relationship forward, that's probably the right answer. But we're going to do things that will reveal their vulnerability and then I'm going to apply whatever that is to crush them. And people write that off like, oh, he's got people that are naturally intuitive, actually aren't naturally intuitive. And if I say prioritizing execute, the first thing that people jump to is, I got to get the right resources and make sure I know what the right priorities are. Which I don't know when I covered that on this podcast, but it was like podcast, five or something like that.
