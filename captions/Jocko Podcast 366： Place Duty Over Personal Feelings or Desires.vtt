00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.94
This is Jocko podcast number 366 with Echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening. I go good evening

2
00:00:06.24 --> 00:00:13.04
Also joining us tonight Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening Dave happens to be kind of in San Diego right now

3
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:15.04
So here you are

4
00:00:16.68 --> 00:00:21.52
Leadership strategy and tactics wrote a book called leadership strategy and tactics and in that book

5
00:00:21.52 --> 00:00:24.84
I talked about whether leaders are born or made and

6
00:00:25.80 --> 00:00:27.80
the answer is of course both

7
00:00:27.80 --> 00:00:33.60
People are born with certain characteristics that are beneficial for leadership, right?

8
00:00:34.48 --> 00:00:37.42
The ability to simplify things the ability to detach

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.08
Being articulate these are all things that you can be born with various levels of and

10
00:00:45.56 --> 00:00:48.08
Thankfully, they're all things that you can

11
00:00:49.16 --> 00:00:50.40
improve

12
00:00:50.40 --> 00:00:52.80
Right, you can learn to simplify things

13
00:00:52.80 --> 00:00:58.08
You can learn to detach you can learn to become more articulate. Well, it's not easy and

14
00:00:59.16 --> 00:01:05.96
Some people can learn more easily how to simplify things some people can learn more easily how to detach

15
00:01:06.44 --> 00:01:08.54
Some people have a really hard time with it

16
00:01:09.44 --> 00:01:11.44
There's some things that you can't improve

17
00:01:12.40 --> 00:01:14.32
Right, I know in the book

18
00:01:14.32 --> 00:01:19.86
I use the example of being able to speak loudly because being able to speak loudly in

19
00:01:19.86 --> 00:01:24.98
In combat is beneficial and even even if you're trying to get you know, you're

20
00:01:25.34 --> 00:01:28.90
You've got an event going on and you got to get everyone to move through different room

21
00:01:28.90 --> 00:01:33.18
It's it's good to have a loud voice and a loud voice is a genetic thing and sure you could train it a little bit

22
00:01:33.18 --> 00:01:35.42
But you some people can only talk so loud

23
00:01:36.94 --> 00:01:41.38
Genetic in my family is loud at my house bunch of loud people

24
00:01:42.18 --> 00:01:44.58
So it's genetic trait. So

25
00:01:45.62 --> 00:01:47.62
Everyone's got some level of

26
00:01:48.18 --> 00:01:49.46
inherent

27
00:01:49.46 --> 00:01:53.58
Leadership capability and when you have some kind of a lack like if you don't have a loud voice cool

28
00:01:53.58 --> 00:01:55.58
You get someone on your team that does

29
00:01:56.34 --> 00:01:59.10
And there are some natural leaders out there, right?

30
00:02:01.38 --> 00:02:06.70
And the I don't know how look natural leadership means that they might have

31
00:02:08.22 --> 00:02:13.74
Some better characteristics, but what it really means is that they're humble and throughout their lives

32
00:02:14.34 --> 00:02:16.66
They've developed themselves over time, right?

33
00:02:16.66 --> 00:02:18.66
Some people

34
00:02:20.42 --> 00:02:22.02
have

35
00:02:22.02 --> 00:02:26.70
Very little leadership natural ability and then you have everyone in between

36
00:02:26.70 --> 00:02:32.58
I mean, there's there's some people that they just don't they just got they didn't get the the positive leadership

37
00:02:32.82 --> 00:02:35.22
Characteristics and they might be really awesome at other things

38
00:02:35.90 --> 00:02:41.42
Right, they might be a great athlete, right? How many great athletes are there that weren't great coaches? There's a lot of them

39
00:02:41.42 --> 00:02:47.10
So in fact some of them are actually bad coaches. They were great player, but they're a bad coach. They've great skills

40
00:02:47.50 --> 00:02:53.66
Athletic skills great ability to have great peripheral vision. They have great skills for athletics, but they didn't have a great leadership

41
00:02:55.58 --> 00:02:58.42
Capability and maybe they never developed it

42
00:02:59.02 --> 00:03:02.86
Imagine if you're like the best ball player you can end up with a pretty big ego

43
00:03:02.86 --> 00:03:05.98
Maybe you don't need to listen to a bunch of people so maybe you don't end up being the best leader

44
00:03:07.42 --> 00:03:09.10
but

45
00:03:09.10 --> 00:03:12.22
Leadership is what drives the success of an organization?

46
00:03:12.22 --> 00:03:16.62
So the question is how do you develop leaders and we know we talk about all the time we do it Dave

47
00:03:16.62 --> 00:03:20.58
And I do it for a living we develop leaders we teach leaders we train them mentor them

48
00:03:21.18 --> 00:03:24.98
We put them in leadership positions put people in leadership positions. We coach them

49
00:03:24.98 --> 00:03:29.50
We have developed those programs inside of organizations all very hands-on

50
00:03:29.50 --> 00:03:38.22
So how do you train leaders if you're in an organization that has hundreds of thousands of people?

51
00:03:39.78 --> 00:03:41.98
Obviously you're gonna use decentralized command right?

52
00:03:42.70 --> 00:03:47.26
Because you as the leader in charge of a couple hundred thousand people you're not gonna be able to train everyone yourself

53
00:03:47.26 --> 00:03:49.54
So you have to use decentralized command

54
00:03:50.22 --> 00:03:55.62
So that the training and the mentoring and the coaching is going to take place at at the subordinate levels

55
00:03:55.62 --> 00:04:03.14
But then if you have a few hundred thousand people in your organization, how do you set a baseline of knowledge?

56
00:04:03.14 --> 00:04:05.54
That's gonna drive the leadership

57
00:04:07.06 --> 00:04:14.50
Training and drive a leadership culture inside your organization. Well a couple months ago Dave handed me a manual

58
00:04:15.70 --> 00:04:21.54
And the manual is called it's from the Marine Corps. I know it's a big shocker coming from Dave Burke handed me a manual

59
00:04:21.54 --> 00:04:25.38
It's called the fundamentals of Marine Corps leadership and

60
00:04:26.42 --> 00:04:32.66
For all practical purposes, it's a correspondence course, which is kind of a joke in the military, right in the military

61
00:04:32.66 --> 00:04:40.90
It's like oh you went to Bud's through the correspondence course meaning you just you know filled out some paperwork and then you graduated or you went to flight school

62
00:04:40.90 --> 00:04:42.90
Would you do correspondence course to get through this?

63
00:04:44.18 --> 00:04:46.18
But correspondence course

64
00:04:46.82 --> 00:04:48.82
It's a real thing. It's something that is necessary

65
00:04:48.82 --> 00:04:51.38
It's a real thing. It's something that is necessary

66
00:04:51.38 --> 00:04:55.62
You have to be able to educate people remotely and now it's a lot easier to do that, right?

67
00:04:55.86 --> 00:04:59.70
Because now we have online training and everyone does online training it's advanced a lot

68
00:04:59.78 --> 00:05:02.02
We have the we have the extreme ownership academy

69
00:05:02.98 --> 00:05:07.70
And we've got a whole new platform rolling out with that. What date does that come out? What dates a new platform January 1?

70
00:05:07.70 --> 00:05:09.78
Oh my goodness happening. Oh, so this will be live

71
00:05:10.66 --> 00:05:13.70
so we have a new platform with that and

72
00:05:13.70 --> 00:05:19.86
And even you know when when laif and I first started talking about having an online training platform

73
00:05:20.66 --> 00:05:23.70
Both of us I think laif more so because I'd seen some other

74
00:05:24.26 --> 00:05:30.26
Possibilities laif was just thinking about what we had you know in the in the in the navy these online trainings that you had to take

75
00:05:30.26 --> 00:05:32.26
They were super boring

76
00:05:32.50 --> 00:05:36.50
Super not user friendly and it didn't seem like a viable option

77
00:05:36.66 --> 00:05:37.54
Of course

78
00:05:37.54 --> 00:05:40.98
Covid hit and all of a sudden everyone's online everyone understood the benefits

79
00:05:40.98 --> 00:05:45.30
And so luckily we had kind of started the academy now and then we went hard on it now

80
00:05:45.30 --> 00:05:50.74
We've got an outstanding product the new the new one that's all outstanding. Yeah, it's awesome. I was pretty impressed

81
00:05:50.74 --> 00:05:53.14
I was extremely I could actually I couldn't have been more impressed

82
00:05:53.94 --> 00:05:56.50
So we've got the extreme ownership academy

83
00:05:57.14 --> 00:06:03.38
Um, but before that was available things like this manual were out and the manuals dated October

84
00:06:04.42 --> 00:06:08.42
Of 2000 so there wasn't really a big online training capability

85
00:06:08.42 --> 00:06:10.42
And also this is

86
00:06:11.22 --> 00:06:14.18
Something to think about this before the war kicked off

87
00:06:16.10 --> 00:06:20.42
So there's sometimes as I read through this manual that I was like

88
00:06:21.70 --> 00:06:24.02
We've been we've been at peace for a while haven't we?

89
00:06:25.94 --> 00:06:30.50
Because war teaches and reteaches lessons unlike any other instructor

90
00:06:32.10 --> 00:06:34.10
And you'll see some of those so

91
00:06:34.10 --> 00:06:39.70
Anyways, but that being said there's a bunch of good lessons and reminders about leadership

92
00:06:39.70 --> 00:06:41.70
And I want to talk through some of those today

93
00:06:42.50 --> 00:06:46.50
and also put this up as kind of an example of the type of

94
00:06:47.30 --> 00:06:52.74
The type of program you can put in place if you're running a large organization or if you're running a small organization

95
00:06:53.06 --> 00:06:55.22
How often do we talk to clients that have?

96
00:06:56.50 --> 00:07:00.98
40 people but they got a decent churn rate a little higher than they want

97
00:07:00.98 --> 00:07:04.66
They got new people checking in all the time or like you get a

98
00:07:04.90 --> 00:07:10.18
Medical staff let's say medical staff you got professionals, but they might work with a different team for three days

99
00:07:10.18 --> 00:07:11.54
And then not see that team again

100
00:07:11.54 --> 00:07:14.82
There's certain environments where you're going to have a rapid turnover

101
00:07:15.30 --> 00:07:22.10
So it's nice to realize that you can set up a standard operating procedure that you can give people some level of baseline

102
00:07:22.74 --> 00:07:24.74
knowledge very quickly

103
00:07:25.30 --> 00:07:29.30
And and you could move forward as a unified team if you have a good plan around it

104
00:07:29.30 --> 00:07:31.30
And this is sort of an example that so

105
00:07:33.14 --> 00:07:35.54
I also really appreciate the Marine Corps

106
00:07:36.74 --> 00:07:40.42
Because they they have a an ability to

107
00:07:41.30 --> 00:07:46.10
Speak to their audience in a way that can be pretty transformational

108
00:07:49.14 --> 00:07:50.26
So

109
00:07:50.26 --> 00:07:53.14
Young marine stopped by the gym today just out of boot camp

110
00:07:53.78 --> 00:07:56.18
You know and you you're looking at him. Yep 100%

111
00:07:56.18 --> 00:08:00.42
You know as soon as I saw him I was like, yep, this guy this kid just graduated from Marine Corps boot camp

112
00:08:00.42 --> 00:08:02.90
You know he's standing at attention waiting to talk to me. I'm like check

113
00:08:03.70 --> 00:08:05.70
He's like, you know, good afternoon, sir. Yep

114
00:08:06.10 --> 00:08:07.46
Good afternoon

115
00:08:07.46 --> 00:08:10.82
When did you graduate from boot camp four days ago outstanding, you know

116
00:08:11.54 --> 00:08:14.02
So the Marine Corps gets that job done. So

117
00:08:14.98 --> 00:08:18.26
Let's go to this book the fundamentals of Marine Corps leadership

118
00:08:18.98 --> 00:08:24.34
It starts off by saying congratulations, which is a really like again, they're getting in your brain right away

119
00:08:24.34 --> 00:08:29.46
Congratulations on your enrollment in a distance education course from the distance learning and technology

120
00:08:29.62 --> 00:08:33.54
Technologies department of the Marine Corps students since 1920 heritage

121
00:08:34.98 --> 00:08:40.58
Heritage since 1920 the Marine Corps Institute has been helping tens of thousands of hard charging Marines

122
00:08:41.78 --> 00:08:44.66
What kind of marine art? I'm a hard charger. You got this, but you're already hard charging

123
00:08:44.74 --> 00:08:46.74
You're already in the game like you

124
00:08:47.30 --> 00:08:52.50
In to improve their technical job performance skills through distance learning by enrolling in this course

125
00:08:52.50 --> 00:08:56.18
You have shown a desire to improve the skills you have and master

126
00:08:56.90 --> 00:09:00.18
master new skills to enhance your job performance

127
00:09:00.74 --> 00:09:02.74
So you can see how they're coming out of the gate

128
00:09:04.50 --> 00:09:08.26
And then it says your personal characteristics. This isn't a question by the way

129
00:09:08.42 --> 00:09:11.14
It's not a survey about your personal characteristics

130
00:09:12.02 --> 00:09:15.54
It's saying your personal characteristics. You are properly motivated

131
00:09:15.86 --> 00:09:21.94
You have made a positive decision to get training on your own self motivation is perhaps the most important force in learning or

132
00:09:21.94 --> 00:09:26.42
Achieving anything doing whatever is necessary to learn is motivation. You have it

133
00:09:27.54 --> 00:09:29.54
This is outstanding

134
00:09:30.90 --> 00:09:34.82
You seek to improve yourself you are enrolled to improve those skills

135
00:09:34.90 --> 00:09:40.18
You already possess possess and learn new skills when you improve yourself you improve the core

136
00:09:43.30 --> 00:09:45.30
Listen you

137
00:09:45.86 --> 00:09:47.86
Corporal Lance corporal

138
00:09:47.86 --> 00:09:52.90
Shmucka telly you are helping the entire marine corps right now by reading this book by going through these procedures

139
00:09:53.30 --> 00:09:57.86
And we thank you for it. You have the initiative to act of course marine corps always trying to get you to take initiative

140
00:09:58.10 --> 00:10:04.02
By acting on your own you have shown you are self self-starter willing to reach out for opportunities to learn and grow

141
00:10:04.50 --> 00:10:06.50
You accept challenges

142
00:10:06.82 --> 00:10:09.94
This is like the affirmations that people say but they're saying it to you

143
00:10:09.94 --> 00:10:16.58
You have self-confidence and believe in your ability and by the way, it's all true like these are all factual things

144
00:10:17.94 --> 00:10:20.34
You have the self-confidence and believe in your ability to acquire

145
00:10:20.66 --> 00:10:25.78
Acquired knowledge and skills you have self-confidence to set goals and the ability to achieve them enabling you to meet every challenge

146
00:10:26.26 --> 00:10:28.34
You are able to set and accomplish practical goals

147
00:10:28.34 --> 00:10:32.98
You are willing to commit time effort and the resources necessary to set and accomplish your goals

148
00:10:32.98 --> 00:10:40.42
These professional traits will help you successfully complete this long-distance learning course

149
00:10:40.42 --> 00:10:42.42
And then it goes on

150
00:10:42.42 --> 00:10:46.90
I could read the entire thing and just you know, we could just sell a uh, what's an audiobook right?

151
00:10:46.98 --> 00:10:48.02
Just get fired up

152
00:10:48.02 --> 00:10:50.58
But then it talks about how to begin the course and it tells you how to do it

153
00:10:50.58 --> 00:10:53.70
It's like a leaf through the text and do an assessment of the different phases

154
00:10:54.18 --> 00:10:58.82
And then study the first unit it tells you how to study because you know look a lot of these kids

155
00:10:58.82 --> 00:11:05.06
They you know, you know, if you're unless in the Marine Corps you may or may not have paid attention to one class in your entire high school, right?

156
00:11:06.42 --> 00:11:12.10
And then you're preparing for the final exam and it tells you gives you these unused unused minutes

157
00:11:13.94 --> 00:11:17.54
Apply what you have learned use the shakedown cruise technique

158
00:11:18.18 --> 00:11:23.46
Ask another marine to lend a hand by asking questions about the course choose a particular study unit and let your buddy fire away

159
00:11:23.46 --> 00:11:26.10
This technique can be interesting and challenging for both of you

160
00:11:26.50 --> 00:11:28.34
just give you

161
00:11:28.34 --> 00:11:31.94
If you followed what the Marine Corps told you to do you'd be an outstanding marine

162
00:11:34.66 --> 00:11:38.98
The sooner you complete your course the sooner you can better yourself by applying what you learned

163
00:11:39.38 --> 00:11:44.10
However, you have two years from the date of enrollment to complete this course. I hope it doesn't take so many two years to complete this

164
00:11:45.14 --> 00:11:46.82
graduating

165
00:11:46.82 --> 00:11:53.46
As a graduate of this distance education course and as a dedicated marine your job performance skills will improve benefiting you your unit and the

166
00:11:53.46 --> 00:11:55.46
Marine Corps Semper Fidelis

167
00:11:55.46 --> 00:12:01.78
So that's the intro they're coming out of the gate hard. They're getting right in your head like 18 year old jocco

168
00:12:02.66 --> 00:12:05.62
I'm ready to rock and I'm ready to do some correspondence courses, bro

169
00:12:06.02 --> 00:12:09.54
Now here's the thing. This is what you got to watch out for. How does this sound?

170
00:12:11.22 --> 00:12:13.22
It depends on who

171
00:12:13.22 --> 00:12:16.42
Is reading it right so you could look at this thing

172
00:12:16.98 --> 00:12:21.86
If you got a did you have a have like a slang term for Marines that were just they didn't want to be there

173
00:12:21.86 --> 00:12:26.90
Yeah, I'm thinking like strap hangers and some other terms and there's probably some more derogatory ones that I'm I'm

174
00:12:26.90 --> 00:12:32.90
I'm blanking on right now, but yes, there were definitely terms. I just can't think of it. Yeah, just somebody with like a negative mindset. Yeah, yeah, yeah

175
00:12:33.62 --> 00:12:39.22
Yes, you could take uh, you know the last podcast that we did we talked about building a palace or building a lean to

176
00:12:40.10 --> 00:12:43.30
You could read this and be like do this is such a load of shit

177
00:12:43.30 --> 00:12:48.42
You could totally do that. I could do it right now. We could go back through this thing. I could laugh at it, right? It could be like, uh

178
00:12:48.42 --> 00:12:52.42
Congratulations on your enrollment in distance education course

179
00:12:53.30 --> 00:13:00.26
Since 1920 the Marine Corps Institute has helped tens of thousands of hard charging. You know what I mean? Like you can see you see what I'm doing

180
00:13:00.26 --> 00:13:02.26
totally

181
00:13:02.26 --> 00:13:04.26
Yeah

182
00:13:04.26 --> 00:13:07.46
And Jamie got a client from an email the other day and she was mad about it

183
00:13:08.66 --> 00:13:10.66
And I was like

184
00:13:10.66 --> 00:13:16.10
Because she doesn't have a there's like a little a little issue with the client and she's working through it

185
00:13:16.10 --> 00:13:20.98
And I'm like um, so she read me the email. She's like, can you help me with this email bad?

186
00:13:21.54 --> 00:13:26.50
And so she she read it to me and the tone that she read it was like super negative and I go

187
00:13:27.06 --> 00:13:31.46
I go cool. I go read that again and pretend that I'm that it's an email from me

188
00:13:32.02 --> 00:13:34.02
And she just went quiet

189
00:13:34.02 --> 00:13:38.50
Because what the email said was like hey, we want to adjust some dates on this thing

190
00:13:38.50 --> 00:13:42.98
But it was like the way she read was like hey, we need to adjust the dates. I was like, well

191
00:13:42.98 --> 00:13:46.42
Oh girl

192
00:13:46.42 --> 00:13:48.42
So you got to kind of

193
00:13:49.38 --> 00:13:54.18
You you're gonna you're gonna read it the way you want to hear it

194
00:13:54.74 --> 00:13:58.90
So why not build a palace instead of a lean to why not turn this thing into something awesome?

195
00:14:00.34 --> 00:14:02.34
That's my recommendation

196
00:14:03.22 --> 00:14:04.18
Uh

197
00:14:04.18 --> 00:14:08.74
So lesson one and the way this thing's laid out is it's like got the lesson playing got the learning objectives

198
00:14:08.74 --> 00:14:10.74
It's like sort of normal military

199
00:14:10.74 --> 00:14:13.94
stuff um, it starts off placement and purpose of the marine

200
00:14:13.94 --> 00:14:18.90
NCO in the chain of command the chain of command is the system the Marine Corps uses to to ensure that each

201
00:14:18.90 --> 00:14:24.82
Marine receives instructions for a particular task from only one supervisor each immediate supervisor in turn receives

202
00:14:24.98 --> 00:14:30.34
Instruction from his or her immediate supervisor. This process continues up to the commandant to the Marine Corps

203
00:14:32.18 --> 00:14:38.34
In this way each supervisor is a link in the chain of command from the commandant to each Marine Corps

204
00:14:38.34 --> 00:14:40.82
And from the commandant to each Marine

205
00:14:42.18 --> 00:14:44.18
That's a that's like a

206
00:14:44.98 --> 00:14:48.02
Hey, they might as well put the president in there that the president of the United States is in there too

207
00:14:48.02 --> 00:14:51.46
They should throw them in there except for the fact that they're look, you don't really care

208
00:14:52.02 --> 00:14:57.06
Hey, man, I work for the commandant never mind anybody else, but I work for the command out of the Marine Corps. That's where I'm at

209
00:15:00.02 --> 00:15:05.06
Um, this chain serves two purposes the first of these purposes to decentralize authority

210
00:15:05.06 --> 00:15:11.06
Since it is impossible for one person to assign duties to every marine or to supervise every task personally

211
00:15:11.54 --> 00:15:17.86
Assignments are passed down through the levels of command. This is called decentralization of authority

212
00:15:18.66 --> 00:15:20.66
for example

213
00:15:21.06 --> 00:15:29.70
The mess officer tells the chief cook what foods to prepare for a meal the chief cook then tells the section cook who in turn tells the other cook

214
00:15:29.70 --> 00:15:35.86
Cooks whenever duties are assigned to a subordinate that subordinate must be given the authority to accomplish those duties

215
00:15:36.10 --> 00:15:42.82
The subordinates held responsible for accomplishing the assigned task, but overall responsibility for its success remains with the marine

216
00:15:42.82 --> 00:15:45.62
Originating the order. This is a horrible example

217
00:15:46.82 --> 00:15:48.82
And there's a couple reasons why

218
00:15:48.82 --> 00:15:52.82
Number one, it's talking about cooks and we don't want to hear about cooks, right?

219
00:15:54.42 --> 00:15:55.22
Um

220
00:15:55.22 --> 00:15:58.10
Not that logistics don't win war because they certainly do

221
00:15:58.10 --> 00:16:02.10
And not that I don't love the people that make food for me when I'm in the military

222
00:16:02.66 --> 00:16:07.38
But that's not really what makes it a bad example. It's actually good that they're given some various things, but here's the thing

223
00:16:08.74 --> 00:16:14.10
The mess officer tells the chief cook what foods to prepare for a meal

224
00:16:14.90 --> 00:16:16.90
Right that is wrong

225
00:16:16.90 --> 00:16:17.70
The

226
00:16:17.70 --> 00:16:22.26
Cheat the the mess officer should be saying hey

227
00:16:22.82 --> 00:16:24.82
This is how many people we have to feed

228
00:16:24.82 --> 00:16:26.82
This is how many people we have to feed

229
00:16:30.66 --> 00:16:36.02
Make it happen. Yeah, he could be like hey, this is all we were able to get from headquarters supply. This is the you know like

230
00:16:36.90 --> 00:16:40.98
He doesn't tell I shouldn't tell him anything other than when he needs to get done and what he's got available to make that happen

231
00:16:41.46 --> 00:16:46.26
Yep. Yeah, I just really wrote down. I I was showing like I literally wrote down the word tell with a question

232
00:16:47.54 --> 00:16:53.62
Don't do that. Yeah, and really then the chief cooks should be like hey guys, you know, here's how many people we got to food feed

233
00:16:53.62 --> 00:16:55.62
What what do you guys think we should make?

234
00:16:56.42 --> 00:17:01.30
and let the troops decide this is authoritarian leadership and

235
00:17:02.50 --> 00:17:04.50
It's not the best way to lead

236
00:17:05.62 --> 00:17:07.62
So watch out for that

237
00:17:07.70 --> 00:17:09.54
Just watch out for that

238
00:17:09.54 --> 00:17:11.46
Besides the decentralization of authority

239
00:17:11.46 --> 00:17:15.14
Another purpose of the chain of command is to link different levels of command

240
00:17:15.22 --> 00:17:18.66
It is a way that the infantry private can talk to his battalion commander

241
00:17:18.66 --> 00:17:23.94
The private first goes through his fire team leader with a problem if the problem cannot be solved by his fire team leader he sent to squad leader

242
00:17:23.94 --> 00:17:26.90
Then the platoon sergeant and platoon commander and finally the company commander

243
00:17:28.74 --> 00:17:32.10
If the problem cannot be solved by any of these marines after they have

244
00:17:32.58 --> 00:17:35.78
They are seen in order of their authority the private is sent to the battalion commander

245
00:17:35.94 --> 00:17:38.90
Any marine can go as high as necessary to get the problem solved

246
00:17:39.14 --> 00:17:42.18
All that the marine must do is follow the chain of command one step at a time

247
00:17:42.42 --> 00:17:46.10
A marine does not have to disclose the subject of a request mass

248
00:17:46.10 --> 00:17:50.82
To anyone in the chain of command except the commander with whom he is requesting the mass

249
00:17:50.90 --> 00:17:52.90
This is always like a big threat

250
00:17:54.26 --> 00:17:58.26
Of requesting mass. Did you did you guys hear that threat? Oh, yeah

251
00:17:58.26 --> 00:18:03.46
Yeah, well, we'll make a guy want to request mass usually the sense of being wronged or something like that

252
00:18:04.02 --> 00:18:05.78
Listen, I heard I mean

253
00:18:05.78 --> 00:18:08.90
I obviously knew what requesting mass was and at some point in my career

254
00:18:08.98 --> 00:18:10.98
I was going to be the person that they were going to be requesting

255
00:18:10.98 --> 00:18:14.26
Did you ever have one dude it never happened never happened. What is it?

256
00:18:14.26 --> 00:18:20.18
Basically like and I know jocke had to but like you want you want to make sure marines understand that they they

257
00:18:20.58 --> 00:18:27.06
They do have the latitude that if somehow that there's there's there's some misconduct occurring in their chain of command

258
00:18:27.06 --> 00:18:29.54
They can go up the chain to the right authority

259
00:18:30.02 --> 00:18:33.78
To to have their grievance error. They're concerned, you know articulated to the boss

260
00:18:33.78 --> 00:18:38.58
So something somebody isn't getting the way so you can go up through the chain and I can actually skip my boss

261
00:18:38.58 --> 00:18:46.02
I'm it's rudimentary in this example, but I can skip my boss and go to the the big boss if I need to request mass and like he was

262
00:18:46.02 --> 00:18:48.34
Describing it can almost be like a you's like

263
00:18:49.14 --> 00:18:56.34
A threat or like I'm gonna request massed. Is that say like in mass? No, that's something else captain's master

264
00:18:56.34 --> 00:19:01.78
That's that's in the other direction. That's like echo. You did something dumb and you

265
00:19:01.78 --> 00:19:08.98
Lost equipment or you did something dumb got in trouble now. You're going to captain's mass. Okay, so it's like okay got it

266
00:19:09.14 --> 00:19:13.86
But this one is this one is like, you know, I'm in an argument with Dave Dave is my boss

267
00:19:14.98 --> 00:19:16.98
and I think

268
00:19:17.22 --> 00:19:22.10
Dave's making us do a dumb plan and I could literally say I'm requesting captain's math. I'm requesting asked

269
00:19:22.34 --> 00:19:27.06
I'd be like jocke you're not on duty tomorrow, but you're gonna come in and it's like Christmas day or something

270
00:19:27.06 --> 00:19:31.86
And you're like, no, I'm not on duty and I don't have to do that. And like this is the duty roster and I have the day off

271
00:19:31.86 --> 00:19:34.90
I'm like, nope. You're coming in and he in theory could be like

272
00:19:36.10 --> 00:19:38.90
I'm gonna go over your head and I'm gonna go to the boss and say like hey

273
00:19:38.90 --> 00:19:44.34
I think he's treating me unfairly and and that way he's not evicted by my really awful leadership of making you do something

274
00:19:44.34 --> 00:19:47.86
That's dumb. We're not fair. So it's like enough or it is an official

275
00:19:49.06 --> 00:19:53.78
Like what he called protocol to go above above the chain or whatever

276
00:19:54.50 --> 00:19:56.50
That's it

277
00:19:56.50 --> 00:19:58.50
off discussed

278
00:19:58.58 --> 00:20:00.58
Rarely executed

279
00:20:00.58 --> 00:20:05.86
When we when we had that mutiny. Yeah, that was kind of like that. It wasn't quite official

280
00:20:06.66 --> 00:20:11.14
Because but we were like, hey, we want to talk to the skipper and we went talk to the skipper

281
00:20:11.14 --> 00:20:13.14
But it wasn't like we didn't we didn't have to go to the floor

282
00:20:13.30 --> 00:20:19.06
There was another time there was almost like a request mask scenario that someone was talking about but I don't remember what it was

283
00:20:20.18 --> 00:20:22.18
all right

284
00:20:22.18 --> 00:20:28.02
The purpose of the marine enceo and the chain of command the marine enceo non commissioned officer

285
00:20:28.98 --> 00:20:31.54
Is the lowest rank link in the chain of command?

286
00:20:31.78 --> 00:20:38.74
The first purpose of that link is to carry the orders and information passed from the enceo's immediate supervisor to the enceo

287
00:20:38.74 --> 00:20:44.26
Sporn it's a pass requests from the marines up the chain of command and let me give you a little hint everybody

288
00:20:44.90 --> 00:20:46.90
You're gonna be translating

289
00:20:47.14 --> 00:20:51.46
What is said down the chain of command and translating what is said back up the chain of command

290
00:20:51.46 --> 00:20:57.86
So if I'm working for Dave and echo works for me and echo says this is the dumbest thing we've ever done

291
00:20:58.42 --> 00:21:01.86
I say hey, sir. We'd like to reconsider the way approach that we're taking

292
00:21:02.42 --> 00:21:06.42
And when when Dave says tell those guys to shut up and do what I told them to do

293
00:21:06.66 --> 00:21:07.54
I say hey echo

294
00:21:07.54 --> 00:21:12.42
I did brief the skipper about this and we're gonna go ahead. We want to proceed with what we've been directing

295
00:21:12.74 --> 00:21:14.74
So you're gonna do translation

296
00:21:15.22 --> 00:21:19.78
And you're translation you're actually buffering the friction that's gonna be there because it's definitely gonna be there

297
00:21:19.78 --> 00:21:25.94
Uh in this manner the enceo is a link between marine subordinates and their commanding officer as this link

298
00:21:26.18 --> 00:21:30.82
The enceo is responsible for enforcing the orders of the commands orders and commands of the commanding officer

299
00:21:30.82 --> 00:21:34.66
The enceo accomplishes this by assigning tasks and then supervising work. That's what

300
00:21:35.78 --> 00:21:38.58
You know, I mentioned that this was this is coming out in the year 2000

301
00:21:39.06 --> 00:21:43.38
And you can see it's and we're gonna get to some part where they go more decentralized and they're using the term

302
00:21:43.46 --> 00:21:48.42
Decentralized, but what we're reading is not decentralized. This is orders and execution

303
00:21:48.42 --> 00:21:51.94
And following duties, right? That's what that's the way this reads

304
00:21:53.14 --> 00:21:55.14
and

305
00:21:55.30 --> 00:21:57.22
Again

306
00:21:57.22 --> 00:22:00.18
This is aimed at a very low rank. I've it's written in here somewhere

307
00:22:00.18 --> 00:22:04.66
But this is aimed at like corpils and lance corpils like e2 e1 z2 z3s

308
00:22:05.54 --> 00:22:07.54
um, maybe e4s

309
00:22:07.54 --> 00:22:08.50
so

310
00:22:08.50 --> 00:22:11.14
Yeah, so and I didn't read that opening piece

311
00:22:11.94 --> 00:22:15.94
But if when I hear enceo in the marine corps a corporal in the marine corps an enceo

312
00:22:15.94 --> 00:22:20.18
That's actually not common across so you're you're I see this as a way to teach

313
00:22:20.82 --> 00:22:28.02
Enlisted Marines e1 e2 e3 private lance corps a private private first-class lance corporal how to one day become an enceo

314
00:22:28.34 --> 00:22:32.50
And I'm really like man, this is rudimentary. It's almost like they're doing it on purpose like

315
00:22:33.14 --> 00:22:35.14
They're describing decentralized command

316
00:22:35.62 --> 00:22:39.38
In a way that's actually not decentralized command because it's so rudimentary like

317
00:22:40.26 --> 00:22:44.26
Don't tell people what to do. But I got okay. I think what they're trying to explain is like this is how

318
00:22:44.26 --> 00:22:49.30
This is how it works in the chaining command. It's really low level in the way that described it's described

319
00:22:49.62 --> 00:22:56.26
Uh, when a subordinate is given a task to supervise the enceo must also give the marine enough authority to accomplish the task

320
00:22:56.34 --> 00:22:59.14
But overall responsibility remains with the enceo remember

321
00:22:59.78 --> 00:23:01.38
Then here's a great point

322
00:23:01.38 --> 00:23:07.38
As a supervisor in the marines or civilian life you can delegate authority, but you can never delegate

323
00:23:07.94 --> 00:23:10.98
Responsibility and this is something we talk about giving ownership

324
00:23:10.98 --> 00:23:16.50
You know when I give ownership to dave to go and accomplish a project and he messes it up

325
00:23:17.46 --> 00:23:19.46
I still own the failure

326
00:23:20.90 --> 00:23:26.34
So um a second purpose of the marine enceo is to train marines to perform their assigned tasks

327
00:23:26.42 --> 00:23:31.38
This training usually in the marines m.os is a combination of on-the-job training and classroom instruction

328
00:23:31.54 --> 00:23:34.02
The marine enceo must be able to demonstrate and teach

329
00:23:34.66 --> 00:23:38.98
More important. He must inspire the marines making them want to learn the skills expect

330
00:23:38.98 --> 00:23:41.38
He's expected to master or they expected to master

331
00:23:42.26 --> 00:23:47.54
And the third purpose is to ensure close supervision and personal guidance of junior marines

332
00:23:48.90 --> 00:23:55.30
And this part disturbed me without a supervising enceo many tasks would not be finished properly if at all

333
00:23:58.50 --> 00:24:04.34
The personal guidance provides a junior marine with someone else to turn to with help or personal problems or preferences so

334
00:24:06.34 --> 00:24:08.34
We don't like that

335
00:24:08.34 --> 00:24:11.78
We meaning me. I don't know if you do. I shouldn't I say I should I don't like it

336
00:24:11.86 --> 00:24:19.30
I understand exactly what you're saying. So we you don't want to have a group of people who unless they are

337
00:24:20.10 --> 00:24:25.38
Supervised closely. They don't do things right that means I'm failing in like 19 different ways as a leader

338
00:24:25.94 --> 00:24:28.74
So that's that's not our goal. Our goal is not to just

339
00:24:29.70 --> 00:24:34.90
Have everything so supervised that it gets done because if we're supervising that closely

340
00:24:34.90 --> 00:24:38.10
Well, then we're too close to problem and we aren't seeing the other things

341
00:24:38.10 --> 00:24:43.86
We're not seeing the big picture and by the way, why why why do we have troops that aren't doing what they're supposed to do?

342
00:24:44.50 --> 00:24:52.10
So if you're a leader in an organization if you're working at a company and the only way things get done properly is if they are being

343
00:24:53.14 --> 00:24:55.46
Strictly supervised. This is a horrible sign

344
00:24:56.74 --> 00:25:01.78
You need to start going down the path of giving more ownership giving more autonomy

345
00:25:01.78 --> 00:25:06.18
Giving people parameters giving them mission type orders, which means telling them

346
00:25:06.98 --> 00:25:10.98
What needs to get done why it needs to get done but not how to do it?

347
00:25:11.78 --> 00:25:13.54
That's what we're gonna go for

348
00:25:13.54 --> 00:25:16.66
Yeah, you you said it already and I was thinking about this this

349
00:25:17.38 --> 00:25:21.70
the concept of decentralized command and how it's different from

350
00:25:22.50 --> 00:25:27.54
I tell you you tell your subordinate you tell your like that is not decentralized command. That's the direction which the

351
00:25:27.54 --> 00:25:31.46
Things flow in the chain of command if you want to use that from a hierarchy

352
00:25:32.02 --> 00:25:36.42
But I just I can't help but think about the the timing of this like October of

353
00:25:37.22 --> 00:25:41.62
Sorry, October of 2000. Yeah, like that's like 9 10. That's like right before 9 11

354
00:25:42.34 --> 00:25:46.42
And before that was like desert storm which listen desert from was legit

355
00:25:46.42 --> 00:25:50.10
But it was like four days long like it and so you have an error here

356
00:25:50.58 --> 00:25:54.66
And what I had what I wrote down is like DC works decentralized command works

357
00:25:54.66 --> 00:25:57.62
But it doesn't it doesn't become

358
00:25:58.98 --> 00:26:00.34
as as

359
00:26:00.34 --> 00:26:02.10
It doesn't reveal

360
00:26:02.10 --> 00:26:10.34
The necessity of it until you're in an environment by which nothing else will work other than decentralized command and in garrison you can kind of

361
00:26:11.22 --> 00:26:16.66
You can kind of power your way through you can you are you can still micro manage

362
00:26:17.22 --> 00:26:20.10
and chain of command lead in garrison and if you spend a

363
00:26:21.14 --> 00:26:23.14
Like a career in garrison

364
00:26:23.14 --> 00:26:24.34
And

365
00:26:24.34 --> 00:26:29.14
What they're describing and this is not to defend it like just you said it well like this is we don't want to do this

366
00:26:29.54 --> 00:26:32.02
But unless you've been in a situation like convent like oh crap

367
00:26:33.14 --> 00:26:38.02
The only way the the only way we will be successful is if we have real decentralized command mission type orders

368
00:26:38.02 --> 00:26:42.50
Chaka goes and makes things happen because all he knows is the outcome and I can't help him with anything else because he's off doing his thing

369
00:26:43.38 --> 00:26:49.46
You don't understand how not just how important is but how it actually works and there's just these little

370
00:26:49.46 --> 00:26:55.70
There's just like little little pieces of like garrison leadership inside that even it's like oh, that's the wrong word

371
00:26:55.70 --> 00:26:59.30
Don't use that word. It's the wrong word. Yeah, and without the context of

372
00:27:00.10 --> 00:27:01.22
knowing

373
00:27:01.22 --> 00:27:05.62
When and how it works and I know it's kind of like they're going to say the real world

374
00:27:05.62 --> 00:27:09.70
But I'll talk about combat without that you are going to use the words that they're using and they're not the right words

375
00:27:12.26 --> 00:27:14.26
The psychology of military incompetence

376
00:27:14.26 --> 00:27:19.86
Wait that book was so spot-on and it was able to capture sort of the

377
00:27:20.50 --> 00:27:22.98
The things that I always thought about

378
00:27:23.54 --> 00:27:24.42
but

379
00:27:24.42 --> 00:27:27.06
The the fact that in the garrison environment

380
00:27:27.94 --> 00:27:30.82
You can totally micromanage. You can totally micromanage

381
00:27:31.14 --> 00:27:37.62
Like it's like if you work at a restaurant and you only have like you've got you've got 10 tables

382
00:27:38.98 --> 00:27:41.54
And hey, here's the rules at our restaurant

383
00:27:41.54 --> 00:27:44.90
Only five tables are going to be filled at a time. We've got

384
00:27:45.70 --> 00:27:48.50
Five tables. We actually have five waiters

385
00:27:49.22 --> 00:27:50.42
and we've got

386
00:27:50.42 --> 00:27:51.86
five cooks

387
00:27:51.86 --> 00:27:58.90
And boom waiters going to talk to that cook and okay cool. Yep. Hey, you getting what they need? Yep, everything's like you micromanage everything you can

388
00:27:59.14 --> 00:28:00.50
Hey

389
00:28:00.50 --> 00:28:02.50
Bring them their bread bring the table that bread

390
00:28:03.30 --> 00:28:07.78
You know, you can do it. Did they get their drinks you can micromanage everything in a restaurant that has

391
00:28:07.78 --> 00:28:11.78
Five tables five waiters and five cooks because everything is just

392
00:28:12.34 --> 00:28:13.78
It's going to work

393
00:28:13.78 --> 00:28:15.78
And even when someone says, you know, hey

394
00:28:16.50 --> 00:28:21.30
Can I get extra onions? You like no no no that's not on the menu. You can't get that

395
00:28:22.26 --> 00:28:25.22
Now if you go to a real restaurant like a big restaurant

396
00:28:26.18 --> 00:28:29.30
A bunch of different people and they're like those waiters are going to have to make some decisions

397
00:28:29.30 --> 00:28:30.90
That cooks are going to be like, all right, we're going to get this done

398
00:28:30.90 --> 00:28:36.18
Hey run over to run over to Vaughn's and grab some extra milk because like that stuff's got to happen people got to make decisions

399
00:28:36.18 --> 00:28:39.22
So in the garrison environment, you can micromanage things

400
00:28:39.22 --> 00:28:42.18
But as soon as you get into a dynamic environment as soon as you get into a combat environment

401
00:28:42.42 --> 00:28:47.22
You have to use decentralized command 100% and in any organization that's that's

402
00:28:48.10 --> 00:28:55.30
Going to progress you have to use decentralized command. So yes, if you work at a completely controlled

403
00:28:56.18 --> 00:29:00.34
Environment you can micromanage. It's going to it's not going to be as efficient

404
00:29:01.14 --> 00:29:04.26
But it is a feasible thing. Yeah, it's not going to be as efficient

405
00:29:04.26 --> 00:29:06.66
But it's going to be a feasible thing as soon as you get to

406
00:29:08.10 --> 00:29:13.62
Any any kind of dynamic environment you're going to fall apart if you if you try and micromanage everything. It's the way things work

407
00:29:15.62 --> 00:29:17.06
All right

408
00:29:17.06 --> 00:29:19.06
four areas of

409
00:29:19.14 --> 00:29:21.14
nco responsibility

410
00:29:22.34 --> 00:29:25.86
Your country one responsibility as a marine nco

411
00:29:26.66 --> 00:29:31.70
To your country is to demonstrate behavior that dignifies the united states of america and

412
00:29:31.70 --> 00:29:35.70
The american people for example when you are in a foreign country

413
00:29:35.78 --> 00:29:39.62
Conduct yourself in such a way that the people of that country will not be offended

414
00:29:39.86 --> 00:29:46.82
Convey the feeling that you are an ally and are in their country as a guest friend and protector of freedom

415
00:29:49.86 --> 00:29:57.06
Not every marine read that section when I was in the seale teams in the 1990s on ships with the marines pulling it into port

416
00:29:57.06 --> 00:30:01.38
The marine corps as a marine nco

417
00:30:01.46 --> 00:30:03.70
It is your duty to be loyal to the marine corps policies

418
00:30:03.70 --> 00:30:06.90
You have responsibility to develop leadership skills professional knowledge and proficiency

419
00:30:07.06 --> 00:30:13.78
You develop this skill knowledge and proficiency through on the job experience reading taking correspondence courses attending service schools

420
00:30:14.10 --> 00:30:15.22
And by seeking new tasks

421
00:30:15.22 --> 00:30:21.22
You also have the responsibility of presenting a favorable image of the marine of the united states marines to both public and or sister services

422
00:30:21.22 --> 00:30:27.06
Community activity and friendly interservice competitions are ways of presenting a favorable image

423
00:30:28.26 --> 00:30:34.26
Check organization your responsibilities to your own organization or many one important responsibility

424
00:30:34.42 --> 00:30:37.86
This training marines as a team in developing that teams loyalties

425
00:30:38.90 --> 00:30:42.58
And it says here to achieve good teamwork a unit must show

426
00:30:42.82 --> 00:30:45.46
Unhesitating response to orders and regulations

427
00:30:45.46 --> 00:30:50.66
You accomplish this by demanding discipline within your unit by taking responsibility at all times for the conduct of your marines

428
00:30:50.90 --> 00:30:53.46
So they're going hard in the paint for the garrison life. Yeah

429
00:30:54.74 --> 00:30:56.74
You're bummed out you gave me this book aren't you?

430
00:30:56.74 --> 00:31:00.74
Well, no, I think it's awesome because I'm like I can't help but

431
00:31:01.46 --> 00:31:05.54
I know what you're trying to say. I that's what I'm telling myself when I'm like, I hear what you're saying

432
00:31:05.70 --> 00:31:07.70
I know what you're trying to say and so

433
00:31:08.26 --> 00:31:12.58
Inside that and you do a good job like you you can pull out the components of like

434
00:31:12.58 --> 00:31:17.46
This is really what you need to be doing. Yeah, and so words like demanding. We're not going to say that

435
00:31:17.94 --> 00:31:24.02
But but in the end I go, oh, I know what they're getting at. So I think it's actually a really cool exercise

436
00:31:24.50 --> 00:31:27.62
To go through this and other things and actually look and go

437
00:31:27.86 --> 00:31:33.30
Hey, this is what they're talking about here. This is a better way to do that or this is a way to pull out

438
00:31:33.46 --> 00:31:38.34
What the lesson could be even though it's not explained very well or not written very well and the other side of like

439
00:31:38.82 --> 00:31:41.22
It'd be better if they just did it said it differently

440
00:31:41.22 --> 00:31:44.50
They just did it said it differently. So like this book is awesome and everything's perfect in here, which is not

441
00:31:45.78 --> 00:31:50.42
Well, the crazy thing is we've covered so many Marine Corps manuals where they literally are perfect

442
00:31:50.58 --> 00:31:52.90
You need war fighting and it's just like, okay. Yep. This is a

443
00:31:53.54 --> 00:31:57.54
Totally don't change a word and as a matter of fact embrace this and put it into every aspect of your life

444
00:31:57.78 --> 00:32:01.46
Yeah, and maybe the thing about this and dude, we always talk about this

445
00:32:01.46 --> 00:32:06.26
We always try to picture the room of the people that are like in here writing this and who these people are

446
00:32:06.26 --> 00:32:11.46
I wonder if they like it's almost like you fall into the trap of like, oh these young Marines

447
00:32:12.50 --> 00:32:14.66
They need to be they need to have it explain to them

448
00:32:14.66 --> 00:32:19.94
It's and like no like you don't need to do that quite so much like they almost feel like they fell in the trap of

449
00:32:20.18 --> 00:32:23.06
All these kids are so young. They're so uneducated. They're so inexperienced

450
00:32:23.30 --> 00:32:27.22
We have to make this so rudimentary that they actually don't do it correctly

451
00:32:27.46 --> 00:32:32.18
As opposed like no, we need to explain this the way you'd explain it to anybody whether you're the CEO of a giant company

452
00:32:32.26 --> 00:32:34.90
No, is there differences? Sure depending on your lay of leadership

453
00:32:34.90 --> 00:32:36.90
But it's almost like they make it

454
00:32:37.54 --> 00:32:42.42
Too narrow because they maybe don't think the audience would understand it. I'm gonna go one step further

455
00:32:42.42 --> 00:32:47.70
I think you're right where they're like, hey, we're telling these guys what they need to do is shut up and unhesitatingly follow

456
00:32:47.94 --> 00:32:52.82
All orders. Yeah, that's basically it like you're gonna get told what to do and you should do it immediately

457
00:32:53.06 --> 00:32:56.02
Right, that's what they're saying. Yeah, that's literally what it says

458
00:32:56.66 --> 00:33:00.90
Unhesitating response to orders and regulations like that's what it's saying now listen

459
00:33:00.90 --> 00:33:05.30
Is there an element of that in any organization?

460
00:33:06.42 --> 00:33:08.02
Sure

461
00:33:08.02 --> 00:33:09.62
However

462
00:33:09.62 --> 00:33:11.62
Unhesitatingly

463
00:33:11.70 --> 00:33:16.34
What what we're getting at is I'm not gonna question anything that I'm told and this is the last thing I actually want totally

464
00:33:16.50 --> 00:33:20.10
And if I'm dealing with a brand new guy that doesn't know anything

465
00:33:20.18 --> 00:33:21.62
I still want him to go hold on sir

466
00:33:21.62 --> 00:33:24.58
Can you explain to me why we're doing it this way because I want him to know that

467
00:33:24.82 --> 00:33:30.42
Yeah, and they don't they don't reveal the fact there's a balance in any of this or dichotomy because there's actually examples

468
00:33:30.42 --> 00:33:34.26
You give where you're like, hey do this and actually you need your people to respond right away

469
00:33:35.14 --> 00:33:38.98
And when they don't you need to realize oh damn they know something

470
00:33:39.06 --> 00:33:42.82
I don't know and there's a reason they're not doing it unhesitatingly. So even inside that there's

471
00:33:43.38 --> 00:33:47.94
There's a there's a balance in that dichotomy. That's just not revealed. So you're gonna read and go

472
00:33:48.90 --> 00:33:49.70
uh

473
00:33:49.70 --> 00:33:52.42
Un whatever the word do exactly what I say when I say it like

474
00:33:53.46 --> 00:33:58.18
I know what you're saying, but that's not right. Like that's not what you do. What podcast did we talk about colonel pogh?

475
00:33:58.18 --> 00:34:00.18
What were you doing?

476
00:34:00.42 --> 00:34:05.06
It was it it was one of those marine corps. I believe it was one of those manuals and we were picturing

477
00:34:05.62 --> 00:34:08.10
Like there was one the guy kept throwing in a sentence

478
00:34:08.34 --> 00:34:11.22
And like it was like the last paragraph of each section

479
00:34:11.22 --> 00:34:13.30
It was all these awesome paragraphs and this morning like that sucks

480
00:34:13.38 --> 00:34:18.90
That's not right and you pictured like the guy in charge was colonel pogh who took all like his junior marines awesome writing

481
00:34:18.90 --> 00:34:21.14
And he's like i'm gonna make sure they also know at the end

482
00:34:21.70 --> 00:34:26.34
The person in charge still gets to do what he wants to do with some garbage like that and it was that I don't remember

483
00:34:26.34 --> 00:34:31.70
Which one is that colonel pogh? Yeah, and if you don't know what a pogh is that's a slang military term for like the rear

484
00:34:32.26 --> 00:34:34.26
echelon person that's

485
00:34:34.34 --> 00:34:35.38
all

486
00:34:35.38 --> 00:34:38.90
authoritarian leadership style and never does anything

487
00:34:40.42 --> 00:34:43.70
Real that's the pogh and speaking of colonel pogh

488
00:34:44.66 --> 00:34:51.70
Unit courtesy is clearly related to the unit's discipline and cooperation an example of unit courtesy is coming to attention for an officer

489
00:34:53.14 --> 00:34:54.98
This is like

490
00:34:54.98 --> 00:35:01.22
So pre 9 11 unit courtesy has a special impractical use often instructions for a mission must be given in noisy surroundings

491
00:35:01.22 --> 00:35:03.14
Time and effort are saved

492
00:35:03.14 --> 00:35:06.98
If the commander has the attention of all marines at once rather than waiting for marines to be quiet

493
00:35:07.14 --> 00:35:12.02
The officer should not be expected to shout over the voices of the marines and compete with surrounding noise too

494
00:35:13.38 --> 00:35:14.34
So

495
00:35:14.34 --> 00:35:17.14
Like you see they put a nice little element of truth in there like oh, yeah

496
00:35:17.14 --> 00:35:20.74
Oh, you're kind of like yeah, yeah, but you also you're like thinking

497
00:35:20.74 --> 00:35:26.50
It's like telling it's and there is I am a believer that there is truth that

498
00:35:27.22 --> 00:35:28.98
being a good follower

499
00:35:28.98 --> 00:35:33.38
Is get you on the path of being a good leader like being a good follower is important and there's just this

500
00:35:33.86 --> 00:35:35.86
this overarching piece of of

501
00:35:35.86 --> 00:35:41.22
How to be a follower is like this the foundation of this like oh when when when criminal broke walks on the reburr stand at attention

502
00:35:41.22 --> 00:35:43.22
Look, oh Roger that, you know like

503
00:35:43.38 --> 00:35:45.06
I know what you're saying, but

504
00:35:45.06 --> 00:35:51.38
Yeah, that followership in there is like this blind obedience is not what you want from your people when the skipper would when we be getting

505
00:35:51.54 --> 00:35:56.18
Ready to do like a seal team one when I got to seal team one and the skipper would come and talk to everyone

506
00:35:56.18 --> 00:35:58.02
Like we'd all be in the classroom

507
00:35:58.02 --> 00:36:01.86
And when the skipper would walk and they'd say feet that's what they'd say did they say that to you guys

508
00:36:01.94 --> 00:36:03.54
Attention on deck they say feet

509
00:36:03.54 --> 00:36:07.78
No, I would like that because it was a big change from you know, you go to boot camp and it's a tension on back

510
00:36:08.58 --> 00:36:14.74
And you get to the seal team one and I'm young jocco in there like you're all standing by and he comes in here feet

511
00:36:14.74 --> 00:36:16.74
And you're just like boom. Yeah

512
00:36:18.10 --> 00:36:20.66
I was motivated by some weird stuff when I was younger

513
00:36:21.94 --> 00:36:26.82
Uh developing unit loyalty is another of your responsibilities to your organization

514
00:36:27.06 --> 00:36:31.38
Just as you must ensure loyalty toward marine core policies

515
00:36:31.78 --> 00:36:36.66
You must ensure your marines have loyalty toward the organization's policies

516
00:36:38.42 --> 00:36:42.34
It's kind of strange to be talking about policies like

517
00:36:42.34 --> 00:36:48.02
Like in this book at this juncture. I don't know like let's talk about combat people

518
00:36:48.34 --> 00:36:50.34
Let's talk about every marine's a rifleman

519
00:36:51.54 --> 00:36:53.54
And belief in the mission. Yes

520
00:36:54.34 --> 00:36:57.54
And taking care of your brothers. What you're talking about. Yeah. That's what you mean. Yeah

521
00:36:57.62 --> 00:37:01.94
Yeah, did you wait? Did you mean do you mean take care of your your your fellow marine? Is that what you mean here?

522
00:37:02.58 --> 00:37:04.58
Is that what you mean?

523
00:37:05.38 --> 00:37:10.02
Uh, if unit pt is required, this is how you know this is how you know if unit t

524
00:37:10.02 --> 00:37:12.98
You unit pt is required. You must conduct real pt session

525
00:37:13.06 --> 00:37:18.82
You can't just go through the motions making each assigned task as interesting as possible and doing each task enthusiastically will help

526
00:37:18.82 --> 00:37:22.10
You develop your unit loyalty. Okay, we'll give it to him

527
00:37:23.14 --> 00:37:24.42
um

528
00:37:24.42 --> 00:37:28.42
Subordinates as a marine nco. You have certain responsibilities to your subordinates

529
00:37:29.30 --> 00:37:31.30
It's the qualifier of certain right

530
00:37:31.94 --> 00:37:36.82
You have certain responsibilities to subordinates. Actually, you're 100 responsible to your subordinates

531
00:37:36.82 --> 00:37:46.42
You must train subordinates in their m.os to develop the proficiency and skills marine the marine corps needs often proficiency and mos means life and death

532
00:37:46.98 --> 00:37:52.50
Either to the individual marine or to another marine. You must educate your subordinates in the military skills and encourage

533
00:37:53.14 --> 00:37:59.38
Individual self-improvement. You must be aware of educational opportunities and the unit's policies to know where to direct

534
00:37:59.70 --> 00:38:01.70
Marines desiring aid

535
00:38:02.34 --> 00:38:04.98
Cool. They want to educate their marines. This is this is

536
00:38:04.98 --> 00:38:08.74
When you invest in your people

537
00:38:09.38 --> 00:38:14.82
When you you know when you're working at a bank and you got a teller and you're like, hey

538
00:38:15.06 --> 00:38:19.14
We can pay for your you know to get you to get your cpa and you can become a financial advisor

539
00:38:19.14 --> 00:38:21.54
Like when you set people up and you invest in them

540
00:38:22.42 --> 00:38:26.50
You want to talk about developing loyalty. That's how you develop loyalty. You take care of your people

541
00:38:27.70 --> 00:38:29.70
invest in their education

542
00:38:29.78 --> 00:38:33.06
Give them more opportunity talk to them about what it's going to get to get them

543
00:38:33.06 --> 00:38:35.06
promoted

544
00:38:35.06 --> 00:38:41.46
Uh, it says here perhaps the most important of the responsibilities of the nco towards subordinates is taking care of their physical needs

545
00:38:41.78 --> 00:38:45.70
These needs include quarters and food. You have no control over building

546
00:38:46.10 --> 00:38:49.54
Which is an interesting thing to say you have no control over building. Okay

547
00:38:50.66 --> 00:38:56.98
But you can ensure that the assigned areas are as good as the situation allows by enforcing high standards of police cleanliness

548
00:38:57.30 --> 00:39:01.38
And discipline you can make the quarters as comfortable as possible with as with building

549
00:39:01.38 --> 00:39:03.38
You have no control over food preparation

550
00:39:04.18 --> 00:39:11.54
But by ensuring that the marines are on time for meals and improper uniform. You can make meals more pleasant

551
00:39:13.38 --> 00:39:15.94
I'm starting to lose it dude. I'm starting to lose it

552
00:39:16.82 --> 00:39:19.86
Well, here's here's one thing that's crazy me. I get it man

553
00:39:20.98 --> 00:39:24.50
I have no you have no control that right there

554
00:39:24.50 --> 00:39:30.82
I've I don't think I've ever told a person in my life. You have no control over this particular thing, right?

555
00:39:30.82 --> 00:39:35.70
I don't think I've ever I don't think I've ever told I certainly would never teach a group of individual human beings

556
00:39:35.70 --> 00:39:37.70
You have no control

557
00:39:38.10 --> 00:39:42.74
Over your building. I was like, oh wait a second. What are you talking about? We don't like where we live. Okay

558
00:39:42.74 --> 00:39:45.14
What can we do to fix it? What can you do to make it better?

559
00:39:45.14 --> 00:39:50.26
What well, let's let's let's get together and explain what the shortfalls are so we can pass up the chain of command

560
00:39:50.26 --> 00:39:51.70
So we can get some improvements

561
00:39:51.70 --> 00:39:56.42
We want, you know to get this the the sink in the bathroom to stop dripping cool

562
00:39:56.42 --> 00:40:01.38
We I do that maintenance myself like what I have no give no control over what you eat really

563
00:40:01.86 --> 00:40:04.42
No control over what you eat like maybe today

564
00:40:05.14 --> 00:40:12.18
But if I'm gonna live here and I'm in this chow hall and you don't think that I can raise problems and get things fixed and adjusted and moved

565
00:40:12.90 --> 00:40:15.06
Please don't tell me I have no control over something

566
00:40:15.06 --> 00:40:20.98
Um, there you go. I'm firing up a bunch of Marines right now. We're getting fired up

567
00:40:20.98 --> 00:40:26.02
This is the first time the Marine Corps at large is gonna be mad at me. I was gonna be going to the chow hall like we want steak

568
00:40:27.38 --> 00:40:29.38
Semper fi brothers you deserve steak

569
00:40:30.90 --> 00:40:33.22
Um in the field you will be the last one to eat check

570
00:40:34.10 --> 00:40:37.46
You can take care of your Marines needs by ensuring that all problems such as those

571
00:40:37.46 --> 00:40:42.90
Enquarters maintenance food quality and food quantity are brought to the attention of immediate super. So you're gonna get that

572
00:40:42.90 --> 00:40:45.62
Food quantity are brought to the attention of immediate super. So you're off control

573
00:40:46.82 --> 00:40:48.82
come on

574
00:40:48.82 --> 00:40:52.98
Marines like everybody else need relaxation recreation time is made available for all Marines organized

575
00:40:53.70 --> 00:40:59.94
Organizational sports and unit get-togethers are ways of letting Marines relax mentally and physically you must ensure that Marines get their fair share of liberty

576
00:41:00.10 --> 00:41:07.54
This responsibility to your subordinate Marines is as of much such importance that it will be discussed in a later separate lesson

577
00:41:08.42 --> 00:41:11.22
Before you can expect the most of your subordinate Marines

578
00:41:11.22 --> 00:41:17.54
You must ensure their well-being take care of your team and they will take care of you take care of your people and they will take care of you

579
00:41:20.10 --> 00:41:21.94
Mayhem out there

580
00:41:21.94 --> 00:41:25.38
Importance of leadership. Why'd you hand me this manual just to make me like frustrated?

581
00:41:26.98 --> 00:41:31.22
Uh, it sounds worse, you know, you know, sometimes I've I've told you I've told both you guys like

582
00:41:31.70 --> 00:41:35.38
I'll read a book like when especially early on when I read a book for the podcast

583
00:41:36.02 --> 00:41:38.66
And I would it first happened with the forgotten Highlander

584
00:41:38.66 --> 00:41:41.54
I was reading that book and I was like, damn this is a pretty heavy book

585
00:41:41.54 --> 00:41:48.10
But when I read it out loud, it was so amplified in my head, you know, it's so much more emotional

586
00:41:48.82 --> 00:41:51.38
And so much more harsh when I was reading this

587
00:41:52.50 --> 00:41:54.50
A few days ago. I read it on a plane

588
00:41:54.98 --> 00:41:58.98
And um, I was like, ah, that's kind of funny, but now it's like actually cracking me up

589
00:42:01.86 --> 00:42:04.02
Check all right leadership in general

590
00:42:04.02 --> 00:42:08.58
Well, importance of leadership. Why is leadership so important? The answer to this question is simple

591
00:42:08.82 --> 00:42:12.02
Without leadership, nothing requiring teamwork can be accomplished. Check

592
00:42:12.74 --> 00:42:16.18
Before you can talk effectively about leadership, you must know what leadership means

593
00:42:16.42 --> 00:42:23.30
There are almost as many definitions of leadership as there are leaders the definition that combines all the ideas is simply this

594
00:42:23.86 --> 00:42:31.70
the sum of those qualities of intellect human understanding and moral character that enables a person to inspire

595
00:42:31.70 --> 00:42:34.98
And control a group of people successfully

596
00:42:36.98 --> 00:42:41.86
Can we come up with a different word than control? Maybe just maybe we can use the word influence

597
00:42:42.82 --> 00:42:47.78
But they use the word control totally. Yeah, so again, we're talking garrison

598
00:42:48.90 --> 00:42:53.70
mindset like I'm gonna get my waiters to do exactly what I tell them to do because

599
00:42:54.50 --> 00:42:56.66
I have control over everything and I can control them

600
00:42:56.66 --> 00:43:05.46
Not a good sign. It's so funny, man. Yeah, they're I don't remember the exact saying but there's like this metaphor of like when someone's

601
00:43:06.34 --> 00:43:09.22
Um, sort of in the right area, but but but off the mark

602
00:43:09.62 --> 00:43:13.54
They they'll say something like and I wish I could remember it like you did in the reference

603
00:43:13.54 --> 00:43:17.22
You're shooting you're you're shooting on the right target, which means I'm on paper

604
00:43:17.94 --> 00:43:21.14
Yeah, but I'm missing the the the mark or whatever it's like

605
00:43:21.78 --> 00:43:25.46
If I'm way off I'm like shooting on somebody else's target like that's a real problem

606
00:43:25.46 --> 00:43:27.46
So I can't help it like

607
00:43:27.70 --> 00:43:31.70
I know what you're I you're you're sort of in the right like you're point at the right place

608
00:43:32.18 --> 00:43:36.26
But you're you're you're hitting all over the you're not off the target, right?

609
00:43:36.42 --> 00:43:40.02
But you were off the mark like we would say in the teams like you're on paper

610
00:43:40.18 --> 00:43:44.34
Okay, meaning like there's a bullseye. That's a little black thing. Yeah. Yeah, and then there's like rings around it

611
00:43:44.34 --> 00:43:48.74
Yes, you're not in the rings, but you're on the broader like big giant piece of paper at the butts at

612
00:43:49.06 --> 00:43:51.62
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and island it's like, okay, you're

613
00:43:51.62 --> 00:43:55.54
Actually, you're you're you're on paper. I mean you're you're hitting it. Yeah

614
00:43:56.26 --> 00:43:59.46
We are off the mark. Yeah, you have shooting on the right target

615
00:43:59.54 --> 00:44:05.38
Which just means like if echoes like shooting at someone else's turn like, okay, we need like this is a whole different problem

616
00:44:06.10 --> 00:44:08.42
But I just like you are not hitting the target

617
00:44:08.58 --> 00:44:12.10
But but you're on the print. I know what you're trying to say, but you're just they're on paper

618
00:44:12.18 --> 00:44:18.90
But they got some they gotta make some adjustments and and that difference is is 20 of war. That's like, yeah

619
00:44:18.90 --> 00:44:23.78
Yeah, yeah, and that difference on being on paper versus being that's a kill shot versus

620
00:44:24.26 --> 00:44:27.22
Not, you know, you're you're all gonna die because you can't shoot straight totally man

621
00:44:28.02 --> 00:44:30.02
crazy

622
00:44:30.10 --> 00:44:34.34
Leadership and you know, it's funny. You're gonna see well, we're not gonna cover this whole manual

623
00:44:34.34 --> 00:44:38.26
But you're gonna see when they get back to sort of fundamentals

624
00:44:39.14 --> 00:44:43.22
It seems like they're trying to explore new territory here. That's what it seems like to me

625
00:44:43.70 --> 00:44:48.02
You can almost pitch like hey go back and come up with um, you know, like the best example you can

626
00:44:48.02 --> 00:44:52.82
Yeah, and they're like, okay. Okay. I remember this time when I was like the mess hall

627
00:44:52.98 --> 00:44:54.98
Like they're not remembering

628
00:44:55.22 --> 00:44:58.50
Rilotti or Fallujah or Baghdad or they're remembering

629
00:44:59.22 --> 00:45:01.06
Cooking or like yeah, which is fine

630
00:45:01.22 --> 00:45:06.02
But that's all they have in their repository to come out of like oh the scenarios that they want to use to illustrate these examples

631
00:45:06.10 --> 00:45:08.10
They don't have the examples. Yeah

632
00:45:09.14 --> 00:45:11.46
And what the problem here's the problem with those examples

633
00:45:11.46 --> 00:45:19.46
The problem isn't the example of being being logisticians in the Marine Corps and cooking in the Marine Corps. God bless you

634
00:45:20.18 --> 00:45:21.86
and in the Navy

635
00:45:21.86 --> 00:45:26.26
God bless you. The problem is they're not the dynamic situations that demand

636
00:45:27.70 --> 00:45:30.74
The type of leadership that we know to be effective

637
00:45:31.46 --> 00:45:32.42
So

638
00:45:32.42 --> 00:45:34.26
It just doesn't work as well

639
00:45:34.26 --> 00:45:36.42
If you are cooking in a combat environment

640
00:45:36.42 --> 00:45:41.54
You're talking about how these people need to make decisions on what what they're going to put forward like those are things that that's

641
00:45:41.78 --> 00:45:43.54
Decentralized command is going to is the only way it's going to work

642
00:45:43.54 --> 00:45:51.06
How are you going to get food to for four platoons or in four different locations right now doing like crazy 24 7 operate yet?

643
00:45:51.06 --> 00:45:52.66
Yeah, totally

644
00:45:52.66 --> 00:45:53.94
uh

645
00:45:53.94 --> 00:45:59.06
Elements of leadership this definition does not mention the military because leadership is not exclusive to the military

646
00:45:59.14 --> 00:46:04.58
We concur leadership is necessary wherever two or more people get together to perform a common task check

647
00:46:04.58 --> 00:46:10.98
The leader's primary purpose is to ensure that the job is done or in the words of the military that the mission has accomplished

648
00:46:11.22 --> 00:46:13.86
Three essential elements are needed to perform the role of a leader

649
00:46:14.42 --> 00:46:18.10
The leader is the first essential element the second element leadership is the group

650
00:46:18.82 --> 00:46:21.70
And the third is the situation and i'm not going to cover this because

651
00:46:22.18 --> 00:46:26.10
Again, this is something that i'd never seen before and it seemed like maybe somebody

652
00:46:26.82 --> 00:46:28.82
had an idea

653
00:46:29.46 --> 00:46:32.26
And the idea is that in these for leadership to happen

654
00:46:32.26 --> 00:46:35.38
There has to be a leader that has to be a group and there has to be a situation and that's what leadership is

655
00:46:35.62 --> 00:46:36.98
So i get it

656
00:46:36.98 --> 00:46:41.46
But we're not going to spend a bunch of time on it. Um, the objective of military leadership

657
00:46:41.46 --> 00:46:45.62
The united states military has the mission of keeping our country free to accomplish this mission

658
00:46:45.86 --> 00:46:51.54
Strong military leadership is essential marines are all potential leaders and military leadership should be important to everyone

659
00:46:51.78 --> 00:46:56.34
The objective or goal of military leadership is the creation and maintenance of an organization which will

660
00:46:56.34 --> 00:47:06.50
Loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task assigned or indicated and will initiate suitable action in the absence of orders

661
00:47:09.06 --> 00:47:11.06
So

662
00:47:12.58 --> 00:47:19.62
What's interesting is it's interesting that it says the goal of military leadership and it doesn't really say anything about

663
00:47:20.82 --> 00:47:22.98
War and combat that's number one

664
00:47:22.98 --> 00:47:29.54
Because that's what the military is for by the way is for war and combat and it can do a bunch of other things as well and it does

665
00:47:30.66 --> 00:47:36.34
Here's another thing willingly, loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task. You know what that should be

666
00:47:37.14 --> 00:47:38.98
it should be

667
00:47:38.98 --> 00:47:40.98
legal task, right

668
00:47:41.62 --> 00:47:43.78
Because we want to make sure that people are doing things that are

669
00:47:44.74 --> 00:47:48.50
within the code of contact within the within the law of land warfare

670
00:47:48.50 --> 00:47:52.98
And then they get it right at the end which is

671
00:47:53.86 --> 00:48:00.42
Suitable action in the absence of orders. That's like yeah the tiniest sliver of what we want. Yeah

672
00:48:01.06 --> 00:48:02.50
Even in the beginning

673
00:48:02.50 --> 00:48:06.50
Like I think it's that something like all marines are potential leaders like stop

674
00:48:07.14 --> 00:48:13.14
All marines are leaders. Yeah, just as something is marines are all potential leaders. Yeah. Nope. No everybody

675
00:48:13.14 --> 00:48:17.62
Every every marine is a leader. Yes every one of you. Yes. Yeah, totally

676
00:48:18.66 --> 00:48:21.62
It's like you said they're on paper. They're on the paper. We get what you're saying

677
00:48:22.50 --> 00:48:24.02
We hear what you're saying

678
00:48:24.02 --> 00:48:26.02
Three reasons for military leadership

679
00:48:26.18 --> 00:48:31.86
The first reason is the coordination of people and activities within a unit that is getting the right people to do the right job

680
00:48:31.94 --> 00:48:33.78
Okay, that's good

681
00:48:33.78 --> 00:48:37.38
Without such coordination capable people will not be assigned the right tasks. Okay

682
00:48:37.38 --> 00:48:44.42
The second reason for military leadership is to hold a military unit together a military unit is made up of people organized to

683
00:48:44.50 --> 00:48:48.58
accomplish a mission that requires a successful completion of a series of tasks

684
00:48:50.82 --> 00:48:55.70
When the unit is deployed a number of set tasks must be assigned to complete it again, it's all top down

685
00:48:56.26 --> 00:48:58.82
This is like this is the the top down manual

686
00:49:02.34 --> 00:49:07.30
The unit must be inspected to ensure readiness training schedules must be prepared in logistics plans

687
00:49:07.30 --> 00:49:11.14
Must be made up because it would be difficult for one leader to do all things alone

688
00:49:11.54 --> 00:49:14.58
Unit leaders are needed. Okay, so we want a little decentralized command. Thank you

689
00:49:15.38 --> 00:49:17.38
In the marine corps these unit leaders

690
00:49:17.86 --> 00:49:19.86
form a chain of command from a command on

691
00:49:20.34 --> 00:49:22.34
on down to the smallest unit so

692
00:49:22.90 --> 00:49:29.46
Third reason for military leadership is to ensure a unit success the unit achieve success by accomplishing the assigned mission

693
00:49:31.30 --> 00:49:35.38
Through demonstration motivation and hard work leaders ensure that all missions are accomplished

694
00:49:35.38 --> 00:49:40.66
A leader's failure to ensure that subordinates accomplish their task leads the failure of a unit to accomplish its mission

695
00:49:40.66 --> 00:49:43.14
And thus failure of the military service and carrying out a larger mission

696
00:49:43.46 --> 00:49:47.30
And if the military service fails our country and way of life are in danger, okay

697
00:49:47.86 --> 00:49:52.10
Somebody cool wrote that little section and didn't get too heavily edited by colonel pogh

698
00:49:54.50 --> 00:49:58.18
Responsibilities of leadership leadership implies responsibility

699
00:49:59.78 --> 00:50:04.58
Within the military structure there are two general areas of responsibility for every leader in every situation

700
00:50:04.58 --> 00:50:10.66
They are one the responsibility for ensuring that the mission is accomplished and two the responsibility to the subordinates

701
00:50:10.82 --> 00:50:13.38
Who work to accomplish that mission excellent, right?

702
00:50:14.74 --> 00:50:17.14
Completion of the mission is the first priority of leadership

703
00:50:18.74 --> 00:50:24.18
I swear I was just about to say I wish he had just reversed those two like in the previous paragraph

704
00:50:24.34 --> 00:50:27.06
Like the way he wrote it in order and here's the thing

705
00:50:29.22 --> 00:50:30.82
These these two

706
00:50:30.82 --> 00:50:36.02
the the men and the mission the subordinates and the mission taking care of the and and

707
00:50:37.06 --> 00:50:40.02
Putting the mission as the priority listen

708
00:50:44.58 --> 00:50:48.66
There are times and that's that's what the military does the military

709
00:50:49.46 --> 00:50:51.30
has to sacrifice

710
00:50:51.30 --> 00:50:56.34
Or at least put at risk their troops in order to accomplish the mission sometimes

711
00:50:56.34 --> 00:51:04.10
But if you continually put the mission above the troops you won't have any more troops

712
00:51:04.74 --> 00:51:06.74
And by the way, you'll probably have a mutiny as well

713
00:51:07.94 --> 00:51:12.50
Totally because if you're just throwing people to die to accomplish the mission

714
00:51:13.70 --> 00:51:15.86
Then they're going to rebel against you

715
00:51:17.14 --> 00:51:19.06
Yeah, I mean this is I mean

716
00:51:19.06 --> 00:51:21.94
This is an ongoing debate this conversation

717
00:51:21.94 --> 00:51:28.90
I've heard and and been a part of and listened to countless times all throughout my military career and even to now even in business

718
00:51:29.62 --> 00:51:33.06
You know this mission or people debate and I remember when I was

719
00:51:33.62 --> 00:51:37.38
I was out I was on an exchange with the Air Force when the Air Force like changed their motto

720
00:51:37.78 --> 00:51:39.62
And I think the motto became

721
00:51:39.62 --> 00:51:41.22
Models are wrong word

722
00:51:41.22 --> 00:51:42.90
not their motto, but

723
00:51:42.90 --> 00:51:49.22
Some guiding principle it said like yeah, like it's they ended up becoming like resolving to like mission first people always

724
00:51:49.22 --> 00:51:52.66
And and the way I I heard that was like

725
00:51:53.30 --> 00:51:55.30
Yeah, it's really hard to articulate

726
00:51:56.26 --> 00:51:58.26
This is more important than that. I mean obviously

727
00:51:59.14 --> 00:52:01.14
We have to achieve the mission

728
00:52:02.58 --> 00:52:07.38
The concept of the people if you want to say the people are the mission or the people are first

729
00:52:08.34 --> 00:52:10.74
It's actually in the vein of making sure the mission gets done

730
00:52:11.06 --> 00:52:16.02
It's not to subordinate the mission over the people it's to recognize is the number one thing I have

731
00:52:16.02 --> 00:52:22.34
For me to make sure that I'm successful in my mission, which you could say is the most important thing

732
00:52:23.06 --> 00:52:29.38
Is my people and if you can recognize that then all of a sudden you don't this isn't a debate of like what's more important than the other

733
00:52:29.78 --> 00:52:31.78
But if you get them out of order

734
00:52:32.74 --> 00:52:38.18
You undermine your ability to be successful in that mission because without your people it will not happen and in fact

735
00:52:39.78 --> 00:52:43.22
The best thing I can do to be successful in my mission

736
00:52:43.22 --> 00:52:47.94
Is put my people ahead of myself and the chance of me being successful in the mission go up. Yeah

737
00:52:50.26 --> 00:52:52.26
The other thing is

738
00:52:52.74 --> 00:52:54.74
When you accomplish your mission

739
00:52:56.58 --> 00:52:58.58
Even with sacrifice

740
00:52:59.30 --> 00:53:03.94
You should the it should be a win for everyone

741
00:53:04.98 --> 00:53:08.90
So if you're doing missions where there's not like every single person should be saying yes

742
00:53:08.98 --> 00:53:11.86
This is what I want to do because I want to take I want to protect our way of life

743
00:53:11.86 --> 00:53:15.62
I want to protect freedom. I want to protect my family. I want to protect my country in order to do that

744
00:53:15.78 --> 00:53:17.78
I want to do this mission

745
00:53:17.78 --> 00:53:21.70
So when you accomplish when you execute you plan and execute and accomplish a mission

746
00:53:22.82 --> 00:53:27.94
You have the mission is taking care of the people, right? That's what should be happening

747
00:53:28.50 --> 00:53:30.50
You shouldn't be going. Oh

748
00:53:31.22 --> 00:53:32.82
We're going to go and do this mission

749
00:53:32.82 --> 00:53:37.78
But no one in my platoon will benefit every single person in your platoon should benefit from executing a mission

750
00:53:38.10 --> 00:53:40.90
Because you're protecting their families their way of life

751
00:53:40.90 --> 00:53:48.58
Like that's what we're doing and and nowhere is that more true than in combat? Yeah, and that's that's how that manifests itself

752
00:53:48.58 --> 00:53:52.02
That's how it becomes to be so real when you're in a leadership position

753
00:53:52.50 --> 00:53:58.26
Is that concept of the meaning behind those mission is like you would never send your seals out on a mission

754
00:53:59.06 --> 00:54:04.34
That didn't do anything to accomplish the mission and in that same vein you wrote about it that is the

755
00:54:04.90 --> 00:54:07.94
In the core of that is the ultimate dichotomy is you care about your people enough

756
00:54:07.94 --> 00:54:11.14
That you know when you send them out there

757
00:54:11.30 --> 00:54:14.98
They might not come back and the balance of inside that but that reveals itself

758
00:54:16.02 --> 00:54:18.02
And magnifies itself so much in war

759
00:54:18.74 --> 00:54:21.86
That understanding of what am I actually having to go do and and I wouldn't waste

760
00:54:22.50 --> 00:54:25.54
An ounce of human life on something that doesn't actually help us win

761
00:54:25.94 --> 00:54:27.54
But if it does

762
00:54:27.54 --> 00:54:29.54
The risk of that is they don't come back

763
00:54:29.86 --> 00:54:31.86
Yeah

764
00:54:32.66 --> 00:54:34.50
Gets into this

765
00:54:34.50 --> 00:54:36.50
section here leadership styles

766
00:54:36.50 --> 00:54:39.14
There are two extremes in leadership styles

767
00:54:39.70 --> 00:54:41.30
The authoritarian

768
00:54:41.30 --> 00:54:43.30
autocratic and the persuasive

769
00:54:43.94 --> 00:54:45.06
democratic

770
00:54:45.06 --> 00:54:47.54
Each leader is free to choose a style of leadership

771
00:54:51.30 --> 00:54:52.90
Oh

772
00:54:52.90 --> 00:54:55.54
The choice of leadership style is influenced by situation

773
00:54:56.50 --> 00:54:59.06
By the situation the subordinates and the leaders personality

774
00:54:59.70 --> 00:55:03.62
Authoritarian style the authoritarian leader leads by personal control

775
00:55:03.62 --> 00:55:08.98
Characteristics of the authoritarian leader style are as file are as follows

776
00:55:10.58 --> 00:55:13.78
Let's support let's subordinates know he is in charge

777
00:55:15.46 --> 00:55:19.62
Makes subordinates into a team but remains outside the team membership

778
00:55:20.42 --> 00:55:23.22
Tells subordinates what to do and how to do it

779
00:55:23.94 --> 00:55:27.22
Makes all decisions without asking for suggestions

780
00:55:27.22 --> 00:55:34.02
And then there's the persuasive style the persuasive leader uses personality to lead and influence

781
00:55:34.58 --> 00:55:41.54
Subordinates characteristics of the per persuasive leadership style are as follows doesn't emphasize that he's in charge

782
00:55:42.74 --> 00:55:46.42
Develop subordinates into a team of which the leader is a member

783
00:55:47.38 --> 00:55:49.38
Asks subordinates to do their jobs

784
00:55:50.02 --> 00:55:52.02
Makes the decision

785
00:55:52.02 --> 00:55:57.62
But asks for listens to and sometimes takes subordinates advice

786
00:56:00.34 --> 00:56:06.90
Oh, it's beautiful. I like I like how it like even in the extreme example of the persuasive style

787
00:56:07.06 --> 00:56:09.06
It's sometimes going to take the advice

788
00:56:09.94 --> 00:56:13.62
You know and still have to make sure that he's making the decision. Yeah

789
00:56:14.02 --> 00:56:16.18
Um, so that's that's good stuff

790
00:56:16.82 --> 00:56:20.18
And it says that the two styles of leadership mentioned above are the extremes

791
00:56:20.18 --> 00:56:23.38
Each style has its bad and good points

792
00:56:25.22 --> 00:56:28.74
What are the good points of the first one like letting everyone know i'm in charge

793
00:56:29.06 --> 00:56:34.42
Making people in a team but not being a part of it telling supporters what to do and how to do it and making decisions without ever

794
00:56:34.58 --> 00:56:36.58
There's like

795
00:56:38.26 --> 00:56:43.54
Dang man, and how about like oh hey by the way you're jaco, you're free to pick what everyone you want to go

796
00:56:43.78 --> 00:56:49.46
However, you want to do this is up to like not one as good and one as bad. Yep. It just you know, you can pick which one

797
00:56:49.46 --> 00:56:51.46
Um

798
00:56:51.70 --> 00:56:57.22
As displayed in front of subordinates the authoritarian must be perfect or the subordinates will lose respect for the leader

799
00:56:57.86 --> 00:57:01.86
That's that's a great. That's you know, so hey look if you want to be authoritarian, obviously just be perfect

800
00:57:02.66 --> 00:57:04.82
That's you know, hey just go ahead and be perfect

801
00:57:05.54 --> 00:57:11.38
Uh, the persuasive leader must be very alert that subordinates won't play on friendships to get out of doing their work

802
00:57:13.14 --> 00:57:14.66
Oh gosh

803
00:57:14.66 --> 00:57:20.58
Very few marine leaders are strictly authoritarian or strictly persuasive. So we finally get a taste of some dichotic values

804
00:57:20.58 --> 00:57:21.70
Yeah

805
00:57:21.70 --> 00:57:26.82
Most of them fall somewhere between the two styles taking bits and pieces from each the pieces used from each style are determined

806
00:57:26.82 --> 00:57:29.70
By the individual leader the subordinates in the situation at the time

807
00:57:31.14 --> 00:57:35.30
Every marine from private to general needs leadership whether marines are aware of it or not

808
00:57:35.30 --> 00:57:38.66
They seek leadership and it goes into talk about these tangible

809
00:57:38.66 --> 00:57:45.30
Um reasons for needing leadership and intangible reasons for leadership the tangible things are like training instruction

810
00:57:46.50 --> 00:57:51.78
Physical necessities like your shelter and your food. Those are why you need leadership because you won't be able to get them on your own

811
00:57:51.78 --> 00:57:53.78
I guess

812
00:57:53.78 --> 00:57:57.46
Uh incentives if you want to fulfill the need for incentives and challenges. That's why you need leadership

813
00:57:58.18 --> 00:58:04.90
The intangible ones are you have the uh people have the the desire for adventure and security and belonging and recognition

814
00:58:04.90 --> 00:58:08.58
So those were not going to spend a bunch of times on those

815
00:58:09.22 --> 00:58:10.90
And we get to the leader's code

816
00:58:10.90 --> 00:58:14.10
Lesson six the leader's code to be an effective leader

817
00:58:14.18 --> 00:58:16.74
You must know your profession professional strengths and weaknesses

818
00:58:17.06 --> 00:58:21.78
The leader's code is a guideline to use in making an honest evaluation

819
00:58:22.26 --> 00:58:28.42
Of yourself in leadership after you determine these areas you can improve weak areas and exploit the strong areas

820
00:58:28.58 --> 00:58:32.42
I didn't think we were gonna have much this much fun with this. Well, here's a good example like the leader's code

821
00:58:32.42 --> 00:58:34.42
This is obviously a big deal

822
00:58:34.42 --> 00:58:37.86
And you've never heard of it before and it didn't make it out of this book

823
00:58:39.70 --> 00:58:41.70
It's not horrible

824
00:58:42.10 --> 00:58:43.22
but

825
00:58:43.22 --> 00:58:46.18
I become a leader by what I do is the leader's code. I become a leader by what I do

826
00:58:46.34 --> 00:58:49.46
I know my strengths and my weaknesses and I strive constantly for self-improvement

827
00:58:49.46 --> 00:58:54.02
I live by a moral code with which I set by an example that others can emulate

828
00:58:55.38 --> 00:58:58.58
I know my isn't there a little bit of arrogance in that statement. I'm just wondering

829
00:58:58.58 --> 00:59:04.18
Hey, you know what I'm just gonna I'll be over here just setting an example that you guys can emulate. You guys good?

830
00:59:05.38 --> 00:59:09.54
Uh, I know my job and I carry out the spirit as well as the letter of the orders I receive

831
00:59:10.42 --> 00:59:15.22
I take initiative and seek responsibilities and I face situations with boldness and confidence

832
00:59:15.46 --> 00:59:20.10
I estimate the situations and make my own decisions as to the best course of action

833
00:59:20.98 --> 00:59:25.22
No matter what the requirements, I stay with the job until the job is done. No matter what the results

834
00:59:25.22 --> 00:59:27.22
I assume full responsibilities. Cool

835
00:59:27.22 --> 00:59:32.90
I train my men as a team and lead them with tact and enthusiasm and with justice

836
00:59:33.78 --> 00:59:35.78
I command their confidence

837
00:59:35.94 --> 00:59:37.94
and their loyalty

838
00:59:38.82 --> 00:59:40.82
Interesting use of the word

839
00:59:41.46 --> 00:59:46.82
They know that I would not assign them any duty. I would myself would not perform check

840
00:59:47.78 --> 00:59:52.26
I see that they understand their orders and I follow through energetically to ensure

841
00:59:52.26 --> 01:00:00.02
That their duties are fully discharged. I keep my men informed check and I make their welfare one of my prime concerns

842
01:00:02.58 --> 01:00:04.18
Check

843
01:00:04.18 --> 01:00:10.18
These things I do self selflessly in fulfillment of the obligations of leadership for the achievement of the life of the group goal

844
01:00:10.58 --> 01:00:14.90
Check so make their welfare one of your prime concerns. This should be up there somewhere, you know

845
01:00:14.90 --> 01:00:21.22
Uh, and then you're supposed to do like a self evaluation according to this code

846
01:00:22.90 --> 01:00:28.02
Kind of an interesting concept and you know, look, I'm obviously I'm skipping through but they've got like suggested

847
01:00:28.58 --> 01:00:31.54
Activities that you can do at some time in your career

848
01:00:31.70 --> 01:00:36.02
You've been assigned a job which both you and your senior know you could do for some reason

849
01:00:36.02 --> 01:00:38.58
Your senior stood over your shoulder and kept telling you how to do it

850
01:00:39.06 --> 01:00:42.18
The senior did not trust you with the authority of that job. How did that make you feel?

851
01:00:42.18 --> 01:00:47.78
To make matters worse you discovered later that the job should not have been done in the way that you were instructed to do it

852
01:00:47.78 --> 01:00:49.78
And your supervisor seemed to hold it against you

853
01:00:50.58 --> 01:00:56.18
That he was gigged for the job. What can you learn from this gives you a bunch of little examples, which some of them are pretty good

854
01:00:56.82 --> 01:01:04.10
Um, and then it gives you a test and little exercises to do. So that's how you you complete these books

855
01:01:06.42 --> 01:01:08.42
Developing leaders

856
01:01:08.42 --> 01:01:14.42
Leadership traits and principles and this is where you get to sort of fundamental more

857
01:01:15.14 --> 01:01:17.14
Pragmatic stuff that is taken from

858
01:01:18.02 --> 01:01:20.02
More historical

859
01:01:20.74 --> 01:01:24.02
When you get into traits and principles, those are I'm guessing those are going to be like

860
01:01:24.58 --> 01:01:30.50
The traditional like ubiquitous marine corps JJ did type buckle those type of things that that have stood the test of time

861
01:01:30.50 --> 01:01:35.22
Yeah, uh nature of leadership traits leadership traits are individual characteristics proper

862
01:01:35.22 --> 01:01:40.10
Understanding of the 14 leadership traits will help you gain nor respect confidence willing obedience

863
01:01:40.90 --> 01:01:42.90
and cooperation of your Marines

864
01:01:44.82 --> 01:01:46.02
Check

865
01:01:46.02 --> 01:01:52.50
The purpose of leadership traits the purpose of the 14 leadership traits is to help you set guidelines for yourself by evaluating your own personality

866
01:01:52.74 --> 01:01:58.66
And with respect to your leadership traits you can find personal strengths and weaknesses of leadership by following traits as a guide

867
01:01:58.66 --> 01:02:05.30
You can exploit your strong traits and develop your weaker leadership traits and then talks about leadership principles as well

868
01:02:05.38 --> 01:02:08.42
And here's the 14 leadership traits

869
01:02:09.86 --> 01:02:17.54
Number one is integrity and it gives you a definition of what integrity is but then it tells you sort of how to execute integrity

870
01:02:18.66 --> 01:02:24.26
As leader you must have on question integrity honesty a sense of duty moral principles must be placed above all else

871
01:02:24.26 --> 01:02:29.30
You must be totally trustworthy for support and staff faith in you and for your senior staff confidence in you

872
01:02:29.54 --> 01:02:32.58
The trait of integrity is developed by following four practices. Here's these four practice

873
01:02:32.90 --> 01:02:36.34
Practice absolute honesty and be trustworthy at all times not only with yourself

874
01:02:36.34 --> 01:02:38.34
But with others never shade the truth

875
01:02:38.74 --> 01:02:44.10
Be accurate and truthful in all statements. Don't tell your supervisors only what you think they want to hear

876
01:02:44.50 --> 01:02:48.10
Tell it as is but tactfully stand for what you believe

877
01:02:48.10 --> 01:02:53.54
Even if your belief is an unpopular one place honesty and duty above all else

878
01:02:54.50 --> 01:02:58.34
So that's the number one thing integrity obviously very important next one is knowledge

879
01:02:58.74 --> 01:03:02.74
Nothing will gain confidence in respect of your subordinates more than quickly demonstrating knowledge

880
01:03:03.14 --> 01:03:08.74
And it talks about correspondence courses and reading newspapers for current events and having discussions with experienced people

881
01:03:08.74 --> 01:03:17.54
And it gives you the the things to do read all kinds of articles and take courses listen to experienced people ask questions

882
01:03:18.26 --> 01:03:20.58
The next trait is courage

883
01:03:21.70 --> 01:03:25.14
Courage the physical and mental control of fear is essential to leadership

884
01:03:25.22 --> 01:03:32.10
Courage is a mental quality that allows you to recognize fear yet enables you to meet danger or opposition with calmness and firmness

885
01:03:32.50 --> 01:03:34.98
Courage is a quality of mind that gives you personal control

886
01:03:34.98 --> 01:03:38.90
Enabling you to accept responsibility and act in a dangerous situation

887
01:03:39.14 --> 01:03:43.22
You show physical courage when you continue to perform in the face of personal danger

888
01:03:43.62 --> 01:03:49.22
Physical courage also means controlling your emotions and you show moral courage when you stand up for and enforce decisions

889
01:03:49.22 --> 01:03:54.98
That are right even in the face of popular disfavor admitting errors takes real moral courage

890
01:03:56.98 --> 01:04:00.34
To develop the leadership trait of courage you need to do the following it's funny that

891
01:04:00.98 --> 01:04:02.82
admitting errors

892
01:04:02.82 --> 01:04:07.22
Is put on the pedestal of needing real moral courage that kind of shows you the mental attitude

893
01:04:08.10 --> 01:04:11.30
Whoever's right this I'd be like hey brah. I mean like that's like 101

894
01:04:11.46 --> 01:04:14.98
There's no moral courage and said hey, you know what I made I made a mistake here for this duty

895
01:04:14.98 --> 01:04:17.54
He's like bro. You need so much moral courage to say I was wrong

896
01:04:20.26 --> 01:04:22.10
Uh

897
01:04:22.10 --> 01:04:26.50
This is a good one though place duty over your personal desires or feelings

898
01:04:27.30 --> 01:04:29.78
Look for and accept responsibilities

899
01:04:29.78 --> 01:04:36.66
Speak in a calm tone keep an order order new lists orderliness in your thought process

900
01:04:37.14 --> 01:04:40.50
And not make any physical danger or hardship bigger than it really is

901
01:04:40.98 --> 01:04:43.86
Stand for what is right even in the face of popular disfavor

902
01:04:44.34 --> 01:04:50.98
Never blame others for your mistakes check recognize fear but control your emotions. So there you go courage

903
01:04:52.90 --> 01:04:54.90
Decisiveness

904
01:04:54.90 --> 01:05:00.90
I think we might I mean we might even just call it like you never you ever been in a game where you're like, all right, dude

905
01:05:01.06 --> 01:05:06.02
Hey, we just need to walk away right now like we're calling the game. This one might do it to dave burk. It might do it to me

906
01:05:06.42 --> 01:05:07.86
I don't know

907
01:05:07.86 --> 01:05:09.86
So here we go next thing is decisiveness

908
01:05:10.42 --> 01:05:17.86
Decisiveness is the ability to weigh all the facts in a situation analyze the facts and then arrive at a sound and timely decision

909
01:05:18.34 --> 01:05:19.78
but

910
01:05:19.78 --> 01:05:24.82
Before you make a decision you must be sure that you have all the facts

911
01:05:26.26 --> 01:05:32.34
Decisiveness is largely a matter of practice and experience to develop the trade of decisiveness

912
01:05:32.50 --> 01:05:34.50
You should develop so here's why we're laughing at that

913
01:05:35.22 --> 01:05:37.38
There is no situation

914
01:05:37.38 --> 01:05:42.58
Where you have all the facts doesn't exist. I mean even the word facts is a strong word to use in combat facts

915
01:05:42.58 --> 01:05:44.58
Is it is a word you probably shouldn't even use

916
01:05:44.58 --> 01:05:52.58
Yeah, just insert combat into that scenario and no combat leader would

917
01:05:53.70 --> 01:05:58.50
Would they just wouldn't articulate that way because all you're doing is recognizing you have to make decisions

918
01:05:59.38 --> 01:06:04.02
With the void of all sorts of useful information. That's just the nature of it. Forget about facts

919
01:06:04.10 --> 01:06:10.50
Just like basic scenario understanding of what's going on which is why decentralized command is so important because the close you are the more

920
01:06:10.50 --> 01:06:15.78
Yeah, this one is almost like maybe you're off the target a little bit like

921
01:06:17.46 --> 01:06:20.74
I'll give it to you. This is like you just you didn't even hit the berm

922
01:06:21.94 --> 01:06:23.94
You missed

923
01:06:24.02 --> 01:06:26.02
You had a misfire

924
01:06:26.26 --> 01:06:29.54
So interesting, but you know when you look at the military

925
01:06:30.18 --> 01:06:31.46
in the

926
01:06:31.46 --> 01:06:33.46
80s and 90s

927
01:06:33.46 --> 01:06:34.58
and

928
01:06:34.58 --> 01:06:38.02
Look, you but you and I were both in the 90s where this isn't me pointing the finger. This is me

929
01:06:38.02 --> 01:06:41.86
I mean, this is what we did was hey, we need to know everything

930
01:06:42.10 --> 01:06:47.38
We would plan these big missions with a 96 hour planning cycle. That was the standard in the SEAL teams

931
01:06:48.18 --> 01:06:52.82
Did you guys have a standard? I actually think there was I I know that phrase the 96 hour planning

932
01:06:52.90 --> 01:06:59.70
96 hour planning so if you wanted to go conduct a direct action mission, you need to have a 96 hour planning cycle

933
01:07:00.42 --> 01:07:05.14
I have literally conducted direct action missions with seven minutes

934
01:07:05.14 --> 01:07:10.34
And go and launch like that's what we got to so and if you think I had

935
01:07:11.22 --> 01:07:17.46
Quote all the facts bro. We had like a rough grid of where the target might be

936
01:07:18.10 --> 01:07:19.78
Update us as we move

937
01:07:19.78 --> 01:07:24.34
Well, we had I mean, I think the term qrf is somewhat universal like the quicker reaction force

938
01:07:24.42 --> 01:07:28.02
We had a stand a standing qrf all the time which had a very short

939
01:07:28.58 --> 01:07:30.66
After five minutes we had some number like it was five minutes

940
01:07:30.66 --> 01:07:35.38
It was some at some period of time from the time that got triggered to launch the qrf was a very very short period of time

941
01:07:35.38 --> 01:07:37.22
minutes whatever it was

942
01:07:37.22 --> 01:07:39.94
The most likelihood of direct action

943
01:07:40.74 --> 01:07:43.54
Happened on those like if you will launch on a qrf you are going to get into some

944
01:07:44.50 --> 01:07:46.26
fight somehow

945
01:07:46.26 --> 01:07:48.26
And you had no you didn't there's nope

946
01:07:48.26 --> 01:07:53.38
I mean it best you like you're like yelling at the turret gunner who might not even be your turret gunner because he's not actually

947
01:07:53.78 --> 01:07:59.14
Like he's in the chow hall. He's in the chow hall like dude. We got a launch and so even inside that and listen

948
01:07:59.14 --> 01:08:03.94
I somebody wrote this and and and and that guy might be listening to this best intention

949
01:08:04.02 --> 01:08:10.66
Best intentions fully in every way as I hear this. I keep telling myself. I understand what you're saying

950
01:08:11.70 --> 01:08:13.06
That said

951
01:08:13.06 --> 01:08:17.30
And I don't want this to become like a lesson of oh if you're not in combat you don't understand this

952
01:08:17.54 --> 01:08:18.74
That's not the point at all

953
01:08:18.74 --> 01:08:25.38
The actually the opposite is true is the point behind that is the recognition of all these things that you feel like you want to control

954
01:08:25.38 --> 01:08:31.62
When you get in the dynamic environment in business in raising your kids and having a relationship with somebody

955
01:08:32.10 --> 01:08:35.06
And in combat and all things is the recognition is that

956
01:08:35.70 --> 01:08:38.26
You can't do any of these things. You can't do any of these things

957
01:08:38.90 --> 01:08:42.10
So I don't want to be like dave's over here like oh because I was in war. I know all this stuff

958
01:08:42.10 --> 01:08:48.98
It's the recognition of how much less you can dictate and how much more you have to rely on the people around you

959
01:08:49.54 --> 01:08:53.78
Which is why I think the frustration or some of it is the humor coming out of like bro

960
01:08:53.78 --> 01:08:56.42
Did you just say control like you can't control what they do?

961
01:08:56.90 --> 01:08:59.38
Did you just say dictate you can't dictate to them what they do?

962
01:09:00.02 --> 01:09:02.50
And and I think inside that is why I'm laughing at this

963
01:09:02.74 --> 01:09:06.10
But in all seriousness the intention behind that I understand that

964
01:09:06.82 --> 01:09:08.82
And I have this sense of like

965
01:09:09.38 --> 01:09:15.78
You're like pulling someone from the boot camp scenario and starting to like ease them into the the real marine corps and listen boot camp at ocs

966
01:09:17.06 --> 01:09:19.06
Those are authoritarian experiences

967
01:09:19.86 --> 01:09:21.86
Nobody's like hey. Hey choco

968
01:09:21.86 --> 01:09:27.22
What would nobody's doing nobody's asking what you want to do and it's almost like they're pulling them into

969
01:09:28.34 --> 01:09:30.34
Just like a step away from that

970
01:09:30.90 --> 01:09:34.34
My take on this is as you as you lead and train your people and lead and train yourself

971
01:09:35.38 --> 01:09:42.50
Just behave act teach and train the way you're supposed to without the sense that they're not capable of understanding or they're not capable of of

972
01:09:43.54 --> 01:09:47.06
Embracing the right type of leadership. You don't need to moderate

973
01:09:48.02 --> 01:09:50.90
Moving away from authoritarianism. You should say don't be an authoritarian leader

974
01:09:50.90 --> 01:09:55.54
Here's the reasons why not. Hey, do what you want. However, you want to do it. It's it's not good leadership

975
01:09:56.50 --> 01:10:00.18
but if all you have is boot camp and do you want Marines to to

976
01:10:01.22 --> 01:10:04.58
To be responsible or yeah, I do. I want my reins to do what I tell them to do

977
01:10:04.98 --> 01:10:08.26
I understand why you're saying that but how you make that happen isn't like

978
01:10:08.98 --> 01:10:10.42
Telling them what to do

979
01:10:10.42 --> 01:10:15.94
So the gap that's inside there for me is the connection between where they might have come from and I'm just assuming you pulled us from boot camp

980
01:10:16.42 --> 01:10:17.62
Which is not the real world

981
01:10:17.62 --> 01:10:21.06
It's not how you want to lead people and somehow trying to meet like

982
01:10:21.54 --> 01:10:25.46
Moderate them into the real Marine Corps. They've done. I'm guessing obviously

983
01:10:25.78 --> 01:10:27.78
uh, I think jim web

984
01:10:28.58 --> 01:10:34.66
James Webb's son, you know, he writes articles and he sent me an article that they've made some like significant changes in

985
01:10:34.98 --> 01:10:36.98
Marine Corps infantry training and

986
01:10:37.54 --> 01:10:44.34
They sounded outstanding and what it sounded like was it has shifted towards like what I when I ran training

987
01:10:44.34 --> 01:10:48.10
What we did which was like really decentralized like it was going to be mayhem

988
01:10:48.10 --> 01:10:51.70
It was going to be chaos and they're now hitting these Marines with those type of scenarios

989
01:10:52.26 --> 01:10:58.66
So that they're even more prepared. So that's a great thing to hear and um

990
01:11:00.10 --> 01:11:02.10
You know again, it's just

991
01:11:02.58 --> 01:11:08.98
It's interesting how we're going to drift right it's it's when you're in environment

992
01:11:08.98 --> 01:11:15.30
Where you can get away with things you'll drift towards getting away with them. Yeah, and it's important

993
01:11:15.54 --> 01:11:21.38
This is almost like a really good reminder. Like you said, it's like not like somebody wrote this with bad intentions, but

994
01:11:22.58 --> 01:11:24.58
um

995
01:11:24.58 --> 01:11:31.54
This is what this is what we're drawn to and the and the authoritarian mind is drawn to this even more

996
01:11:32.58 --> 01:11:33.62
and

997
01:11:33.62 --> 01:11:41.30
The orderly mind is drawn to this even more and the highly disciplined which as you know, obviously discipline is like my favorite

998
01:11:41.70 --> 01:11:48.26
Characteristic and if you have too much discipline, you're gonna fall apart in combat because this is not a disciplined environment combat

999
01:11:48.26 --> 01:11:50.26
It's not a discipline. You need discipline in combat

1000
01:11:50.66 --> 01:11:52.66
But things aren't gonna happen the way you want them to happen

1001
01:11:53.54 --> 01:11:58.26
And they're not gonna happen the way you expect them to happen and the marine that's been obeying you

1002
01:11:59.06 --> 01:12:01.06
Because he was scared of getting written up

1003
01:12:01.06 --> 01:12:05.94
He's not gonna listen to you now because you're telling them to go across the street where there's uh freaking

1004
01:12:06.98 --> 01:12:09.46
You know machine gun fire going down and he's not going. Yeah

1005
01:12:10.26 --> 01:12:12.02
Or he can't hear you

1006
01:12:12.02 --> 01:12:15.46
Or he didn't you know his radio got shot like there's a million things that are gonna happen

1007
01:12:15.62 --> 01:12:20.98
Yeah, and you're setting him up to fail too. Yep. So them the less you can do

1008
01:12:22.66 --> 01:12:26.98
As a leader and the more you allow your team to do the better they're gonna perform

1009
01:12:26.98 --> 01:12:30.42
So you're not gonna have all the facts

1010
01:12:32.34 --> 01:12:37.62
Uh and now it says this form the habit of considering several points of view for every problem

1011
01:12:37.70 --> 01:12:40.74
That's a good call learn from the mistakes of others. That's a good call

1012
01:12:41.14 --> 01:12:45.14
Force yourself to make a decision and then check the decision to see if it's sound. Well, that's a good call

1013
01:12:45.70 --> 01:12:52.02
Talk to people and practice making your conversations logical and clear. That's a good call. So those are all those are all positive

1014
01:12:52.02 --> 01:12:56.74
Dependability a dependable leader is one who can be relied on to carry out

1015
01:12:57.38 --> 01:13:00.34
Any mission to the best of his or her personality cool

1016
01:13:01.70 --> 01:13:03.46
um

1017
01:13:03.46 --> 01:13:06.90
It says the steps are practiced honest thinking

1018
01:13:08.02 --> 01:13:10.02
avoid making excuses

1019
01:13:11.86 --> 01:13:14.42
We're no stronger than avoid we can actually say do not

1020
01:13:16.10 --> 01:13:18.10
Uh accomplish the assigned task

1021
01:13:18.10 --> 01:13:26.10
Regardless of the obstacles cool always be prompt to perform all tasks the best of your ability. Yeah check be careful about making promises and personal deals

1022
01:13:27.30 --> 01:13:31.70
But when you have made them build a reputation on keeping them. What kind of personal deals are we talking about here?

1023
01:13:31.70 --> 01:13:37.38
I'm not 100 sure maybe that's like on the civilian sector. They're talking about like I'll sell you this car for 900 bucks

1024
01:13:40.26 --> 01:13:42.26
Initiative

1025
01:13:42.26 --> 01:13:50.02
The trait of initiative is key to being a successful leader initiative is simply seeing what has to be done and doing it without having to be told to do it. Yes

1026
01:13:51.38 --> 01:13:56.18
As a marine nco, you must develop initiative not only in yourself, but in your subordinates as well. Yes

1027
01:13:56.58 --> 01:14:02.26
Your marines will develop trust and respect when you take prompt action and meeting new situations

1028
01:14:02.58 --> 01:14:06.66
You develop initiative in subordinates to develop initiative in subordinates

1029
01:14:06.74 --> 01:14:10.18
You should assign tasks according to the subordinates ability and experience

1030
01:14:10.18 --> 01:14:17.30
But once a task is assigned don't tell subordinates how to do it unless they ask for suggestions by allowing subordinates to do the job

1031
01:14:17.54 --> 01:14:21.78
It not only develops initiative, but frees you to do other tasks. Yes. We nailed one dude

1032
01:14:22.66 --> 01:14:24.66
We nailed one good job

1033
01:14:24.90 --> 01:14:28.10
closely related to initiative is resourcefulness and goes on about that

1034
01:14:28.58 --> 01:14:35.70
Another side of the another side of initiative is the ability to anticipate simply stated. This is the ability to foresee situations before they arise

1035
01:14:35.70 --> 01:14:42.18
This prior knowledge gives you a chance to plan for the event and have preparations ready deal with situations. Great

1036
01:14:44.18 --> 01:14:51.54
And then just talks about it giving you an advantage. So here's the here's the steps develop and maintain a state of mental and physical alertness look for tasks to do

1037
01:14:52.50 --> 01:14:58.50
For a lot tasks to be done without being told to do them practice thinking and planning ahead anticipate situations before they're great

1038
01:14:59.94 --> 01:15:01.94
The next one is tact

1039
01:15:01.94 --> 01:15:06.34
Tacked is the ability to deal with people without causing friction or giving offense

1040
01:15:06.98 --> 01:15:11.78
More simply stated tact is the ability to say and do the right thing at the right time. You must

1041
01:15:14.02 --> 01:15:17.62
Use tact not only when dealing with seniors, but with subordinates as well

1042
01:15:18.90 --> 01:15:20.90
To successfully use tack you must be courteous

1043
01:15:21.38 --> 01:15:23.38
Because courtesy given will be returned

1044
01:15:24.10 --> 01:15:28.66
It is important that courtesy not be misunderstood as brown nosing inexperienced

1045
01:15:28.66 --> 01:15:34.26
Inexperienced NCOs may feel wrongly that politeness in a military command is a sign of weakness

1046
01:15:34.90 --> 01:15:38.98
All orders given will be obeyed, but those given with courtesy will be obeyed willingly

1047
01:15:41.14 --> 01:15:47.30
Even in emergency situations, I'm gonna get I'm digging myself a hole in the Marine Corps and I'm chuckling too much. I'm sorry Marines

1048
01:15:48.82 --> 01:15:53.14
Uh, but quite honestly, I haven't worked with a Marine that's um in this mode

1049
01:15:53.14 --> 01:15:54.66
I was gonna save my life

1050
01:15:54.66 --> 01:15:57.22
I don't think you have any issues because the Marines that are listening to this are like

1051
01:15:57.22 --> 01:15:59.22
They're like they're on board

1052
01:16:00.34 --> 01:16:02.34
All orders will be obeyed

1053
01:16:03.78 --> 01:16:05.78
Good luck with that. Usually you will find that

1054
01:16:06.58 --> 01:16:10.98
Usually you will find that a calm and courteous though firm manner of speech gets the best results

1055
01:16:11.14 --> 01:16:16.82
Tacked becomes very important when criticizing a subordinate lack of tack can crush a marine spirit an initiative criticism can be

1056
01:16:17.46 --> 01:16:19.94
Criticism must be made in a manner that points out a weakness

1057
01:16:20.82 --> 01:16:24.82
In the subordinates action, but still encourages the subordinate to continue to show initiative cool

1058
01:16:24.82 --> 01:16:32.34
To develop leadership trade of tact you must do the following be considerate develop the habit of cooperating us in spirit as well as fact

1059
01:16:33.06 --> 01:16:37.86
Study the actions of senior NCOs who enjoy a reputation for being able to handle marine successfully

1060
01:16:38.18 --> 01:16:42.10
Check yourself for tolerance and patience if it fault correct your own habits

1061
01:16:42.90 --> 01:16:45.86
Apply the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you

1062
01:16:46.82 --> 01:16:51.30
Let no marine superior or subordinate exceed you in courtesy and consideration

1063
01:16:51.86 --> 01:16:53.86
for the feelings of others

1064
01:16:53.86 --> 01:16:54.90
Cool

1065
01:16:54.90 --> 01:16:58.02
That's not a bad goal try and be nicer to everybody than they are to you

1066
01:16:58.50 --> 01:17:02.66
Echo charles you're pretty successful at that when you're pretty nice guy. Oh, I like to think so. Yes, sir

1067
01:17:03.62 --> 01:17:06.10
I don't think I've ever seen you be mean to know somebody

1068
01:17:07.38 --> 01:17:10.50
Yeah, I don't know it's been a long time. I feel like

1069
01:17:13.62 --> 01:17:16.66
I don't know what else to tell you good courteous marine over there

1070
01:17:17.54 --> 01:17:19.86
Next one is justice justice is fairness

1071
01:17:21.22 --> 01:17:22.34
um

1072
01:17:22.34 --> 01:17:25.14
Search your mental attitudes to determine prejudice

1073
01:17:25.94 --> 01:17:32.50
Seek to rid your mind of them learn to be absolutely impartial when imposing punishment or giving rewards

1074
01:17:33.14 --> 01:17:35.14
Search out the facts of each case

1075
01:17:35.38 --> 01:17:39.94
Study human behavior be honest with yourself recognize those subordinates worthy of commendation or reward

1076
01:17:40.42 --> 01:17:42.42
Next one is enthusiasm

1077
01:17:43.38 --> 01:17:49.30
Explain and I'm going to jump them through some stuff explain why the mission must be accomplished whenever you can do so

1078
01:17:49.30 --> 01:17:51.78
How about almost always?

1079
01:17:51.78 --> 01:17:58.02
No one believe in your work tackle all tasks with a cheerful can do attitude believe in your mission no matter what it is

1080
01:17:58.26 --> 01:17:59.54
Hmm

1081
01:17:59.54 --> 01:18:02.74
Look, you got to be careful with that one. What is your mission?

1082
01:18:03.46 --> 01:18:06.02
Why are we doing it if it doesn't make sense man? Ask some questions

1083
01:18:09.06 --> 01:18:11.06
Ask some questions

1084
01:18:11.46 --> 01:18:12.98
bearing

1085
01:18:12.98 --> 01:18:14.98
bearing is a marine's general appearance carriage

1086
01:18:14.98 --> 01:18:20.02
Deportment and conduct by your bearing you establish a standard for your periods of periods and subordinates

1087
01:18:20.18 --> 01:18:24.98
Your appearance should show confidence competence alertness and energy your clothing equipment should be neat and clean at all times

1088
01:18:25.14 --> 01:18:27.06
Your voice and action should be under control

1089
01:18:27.06 --> 01:18:31.22
Few things can steady the morale of troops like a leader who with full knowledge of the difficulties of the situation

1090
01:18:31.46 --> 01:18:35.54
Neither looks or acts worried when speaking to marines talking short plain sentences

1091
01:18:35.70 --> 01:18:41.86
Never talk down marines or allow sarcasm to enter the conversation vulgar speech frequent loss of temper

1092
01:18:41.86 --> 01:18:46.02
Like it says frequent loss of temper like occasionally go for it

1093
01:18:46.82 --> 01:18:54.02
And an irritable nature show lack of self-confidence that subordinates easily see they react to the lack of self-confidence with resentment or even in

1094
01:18:54.42 --> 01:18:58.02
Subordination avoid criticizing the entire group of marines for the failings of a few

1095
01:18:59.70 --> 01:19:03.38
Those who didn't want those who didn't do anything wrong will resent it

1096
01:19:03.54 --> 01:19:09.46
Your bearing should show dignity and control of both your emotions and your actions dignity shows pride and confidence in yourself

1097
01:19:09.46 --> 01:19:12.26
and the ability of your marines emotional control shows that you

1098
01:19:13.14 --> 01:19:14.42
have

1099
01:19:14.42 --> 01:19:18.50
Any situation well in hand to develop and improve your bearing you should do the following

1100
01:19:19.06 --> 01:19:21.70
Practice control of your voice facial expressions and gestures

1101
01:19:23.14 --> 01:19:29.54
Demonstrate calmness sincerity and understanding master your emotions so that you can control them and they do not control you

1102
01:19:30.34 --> 01:19:32.34
Speak simply and directly

1103
01:19:32.34 --> 01:19:34.34
Never reprimand subordinates and spell

1104
01:19:34.66 --> 01:19:36.66
Observe the study leaders who enjoy reputed

1105
01:19:36.66 --> 01:19:38.66
No one in here regulations

1106
01:19:39.94 --> 01:19:44.98
Demand the highest of standards for yourself and your subordinates avoid indiscriminate course behavior profanity and vulgarity

1107
01:19:46.66 --> 01:19:50.18
They didn't see full metal jacket, maybe it is amazing like I went to ocs

1108
01:19:50.74 --> 01:19:55.46
And those marines those marine drill instructors they never swore it. I mean, but I mean they probably swore five times or something like that

1109
01:19:56.02 --> 01:19:58.02
What about the basic school?

1110
01:19:58.50 --> 01:20:00.50
I mean to be quite honest like I

1111
01:20:01.38 --> 01:20:03.54
After oc I mean even partially at ocs

1112
01:20:03.54 --> 01:20:06.58
Like the best leaders that I worked with were were

1113
01:20:07.30 --> 01:20:12.82
Professional and they they were articulate and they spoke professionally if I look back and like the guys that I looked up to the most

1114
01:20:13.54 --> 01:20:15.14
They were professional

1115
01:20:15.14 --> 01:20:17.14
that said

1116
01:20:19.14 --> 01:20:23.14
The the use of vulgarity was I would say like commonplace

1117
01:20:23.86 --> 01:20:25.86
Um, but even at the basic school

1118
01:20:26.66 --> 01:20:32.34
Uh amongst the marine females going through the basic school. Yeah, I was in an integrated company like I think one of the first one in the

1119
01:20:32.34 --> 01:20:33.54
while

1120
01:20:33.54 --> 01:20:35.54
amongst like the marines

1121
01:20:35.54 --> 01:20:40.90
Was everybody was cursing all the time. What about the instructor stuff? No, that's what I'm saying like the yeah

1122
01:20:41.46 --> 01:20:48.66
Um, and I think what my point of that was it wasn't something that was policed. It was something that was I think demonstrated

1123
01:20:49.62 --> 01:20:50.74
and

1124
01:20:50.74 --> 01:20:56.18
Like I don't remember my platoon commander a guy who I respect I don't I have no record and it could have happened

1125
01:20:56.18 --> 01:21:01.78
But I don't have a recollection of him cursing and I have a recollection of some and some not but like the lieutenants like I think I

1126
01:21:01.78 --> 01:21:05.70
Cur I mean we curse all the time. Yeah. Yeah, but the staff did correct. That's the main thing

1127
01:21:05.70 --> 01:21:07.38
That's right. Yeah, the example that was being shown

1128
01:21:07.38 --> 01:21:14.98
It's like we weren't emulating that example the staff even though CS were pretty professional people in terms of not cursing and just

1129
01:21:15.22 --> 01:21:21.22
Being articulate well spoken leaders was valued. Is it hard to get a billet like as an OCS instructor?

1130
01:21:21.78 --> 01:21:24.74
Not OCS. No, I think tbs is a more

1131
01:21:25.78 --> 01:21:28.98
I don't know if demanding is the right word and this is you know, however many years now, but

1132
01:21:28.98 --> 01:21:33.38
No, tbs was a much harder thing than OCS back in the day to get a job there

1133
01:21:34.74 --> 01:21:36.34
Yeah, the

1134
01:21:36.34 --> 01:21:44.10
Marine drill instructors at OCS for me had like a their whole vocabulary of non swear words. We're words. Totally. Yeah

1135
01:21:44.42 --> 01:21:48.50
That's a dagom friggin. I that's I remember hearing all that and and that that stayed true

1136
01:21:48.98 --> 01:21:52.50
But amongst your peers like it's like you didn't follow that example, but yeah, yeah

1137
01:21:53.38 --> 01:21:58.02
What's tb tbs the basic school? Yeah, so every marine go ahead

1138
01:21:58.02 --> 01:21:59.62
No, I say you mean you got it

1139
01:21:59.62 --> 01:22:04.74
We talked about earlier every marine no matter what your job is going to be pilot infantry or everything in between

1140
01:22:05.14 --> 01:22:07.46
Goes through a six month course as an officer

1141
01:22:08.10 --> 01:22:15.78
Which gives you a little bit of exposure to basically every potential job out there everything from supply to logistics to communication to artillery

1142
01:22:15.86 --> 01:22:17.54
to tanks to infantry

1143
01:22:17.54 --> 01:22:22.34
So every marine officer has a little sense of all the things the marine corps does

1144
01:22:22.34 --> 01:22:28.74
so even a pilot knows what infantry men are doing and the marine corps places places a

1145
01:22:29.30 --> 01:22:35.70
big premium on that concept every marine is a rifleman and the investment they make as a marine and even if you know

1146
01:22:35.70 --> 01:22:41.54
You're destined to go be an aviator you go through the basic school like all marines do it's like general education

1147
01:22:41.62 --> 01:22:47.38
Yeah, kind of like that. Yeah, so you get enough of exposure to do what we talked about before which was just

1148
01:22:47.94 --> 01:22:49.22
Understand what might be going on

1149
01:22:49.22 --> 01:22:53.38
You're not going to be an expert in any of it, but you do get exposure to all of it, which is awesome

1150
01:22:53.54 --> 01:22:55.70
It paid huge dividends to me. We used to joke about it like

1151
01:22:56.50 --> 01:23:00.58
The last time I shot a rifle before I went to ramadi was at the basic school

1152
01:23:01.62 --> 01:23:06.58
Which is crazy. So that's like what 12 years 13 years or something basic school 94 ramadi o6

1153
01:23:06.98 --> 01:23:09.14
12 years. Yep, and you hadn't shot a rifle

1154
01:23:09.14 --> 01:23:14.02
I had not squeezed the trigger on a rifle since the day I sided in my m4. I don't know

1155
01:23:15.30 --> 01:23:17.30
couple months before I deployed

1156
01:23:17.30 --> 01:23:22.98
Dang, but I had done it. So I had just enough like, you know, the basic fundamentals to understand it

1157
01:23:22.98 --> 01:23:25.70
But you know, I've done everything from like 50 cows and

1158
01:23:26.10 --> 01:23:32.18
24 m60s of the time and mark 19s and and all that stuff that is so jacked up. It's crazy. Like like think about me

1159
01:23:33.54 --> 01:23:38.10
Totally dude, like I had spent like literally my entire adult life just doing that

1160
01:23:38.42 --> 01:23:42.98
You know how many millions of rounds I'd shot maybe a rethinking bringing Dave on all those missions

1161
01:23:42.98 --> 01:23:46.34
I kicked you in my mind. I was looking at you like, hey, he's

1162
01:23:47.22 --> 01:23:49.86
But he's a square-dweller, but he's a square-dweller. I mean rifle at heart

1163
01:23:50.50 --> 01:23:55.38
Yeah, I shot the pistol every year for however many years, but I didn't touch the rifle. Which way does the magazine go?

1164
01:23:57.14 --> 01:23:59.94
Oh, that's it was a steep learning curve for me to get back

1165
01:24:00.10 --> 01:24:05.46
The jowl was like a workup. How did you get ready? How many rounds did you shoot before you went on deployment?

1166
01:24:05.62 --> 01:24:10.66
Dude, remember man, so I got to my Angleco unit basically October of 05

1167
01:24:10.66 --> 01:24:15.86
And I spent the first I don't know month basically doing the tactical air, you know TACP

1168
01:24:17.38 --> 01:24:19.62
All that was I was just gonna be in Japan for a year

1169
01:24:20.26 --> 01:24:24.02
And then around Christmas time like hey, we need volunteer, you know, I got a volunteer for that

1170
01:24:24.10 --> 01:24:29.22
I volunteered for that job. Like hey, we need volunteers to go to Iraq. I'm like, well go to Iraq, you know, you know the whole story behind

1171
01:24:29.30 --> 01:24:34.66
Yeah, but it wasn't till that was in January. That was in December. So for Christmas. It was like, hey, honey

1172
01:24:34.66 --> 01:24:40.34
You know that was when I kind of broke the news like this. You were newlywed at that time. We had just gotten married. That's right. Hey, sorry

1173
01:24:41.22 --> 01:24:44.50
So we go on Christmas to come back in January. She was thinking like maybe a trip to Japan

1174
01:24:44.74 --> 01:24:45.54
Totally

1175
01:24:45.54 --> 01:24:50.90
It's like this would be the blast go to see the Kota Khan. That's right. Yeah judo players. Where you at? We we go

1176
01:24:52.26 --> 01:24:58.18
Christmas vacation the holidays whatever and in January they're like, hey all the iraq marines are going to camp lejeune

1177
01:24:59.06 --> 01:25:01.06
So I got to camp lejeune

1178
01:25:01.06 --> 01:25:05.06
January, I don't call it like the 10th or whatever it was and I deployed February

1179
01:25:05.70 --> 01:25:07.70
20th, so I had five weeks

1180
01:25:08.42 --> 01:25:10.18
Five weeks. Do you have any?

1181
01:25:10.18 --> 01:25:11.46
Not a lot

1182
01:25:11.46 --> 01:25:13.46
Not a lot a little

1183
01:25:13.54 --> 01:25:18.58
I like it was like bz ode and then I did a couple of courses, but you know to keep in mind too like

1184
01:25:19.78 --> 01:25:26.50
I use my rifle obviously. Yeah, but my primary weapon there was the radio and you know, clearly I was I was much more inclined to do that

1185
01:25:26.98 --> 01:25:28.98
um, but dude, I don't

1186
01:25:28.98 --> 01:25:34.66
I I I wasn't shooting rounds of that rifle at all hardly ever did you do immediate action drills?

1187
01:25:36.18 --> 01:25:38.18
Like with your team

1188
01:25:38.34 --> 01:25:40.34
yeah, like

1189
01:25:41.86 --> 01:25:48.90
I did very little of that now. I had a couple of pretty squared away staff and co's you must have been so stoked rolling out with us

1190
01:25:49.14 --> 01:25:51.14
You must have been like hell. Yeah

1191
01:25:51.14 --> 01:25:58.10
Like these guys have got I was mostly I was more and I you know, I look back and talk to life about it. I was mostly stoked

1192
01:25:59.54 --> 01:26:02.02
That you were cool with me coming with you like

1193
01:26:02.98 --> 01:26:06.82
That even to this day look back like the fact that they had enough confidence in me and my guys

1194
01:26:07.46 --> 01:26:10.90
So we could be with you guys was pretty awesome for me

1195
01:26:11.06 --> 01:26:16.50
Now your guys these are these are like infantry marines that get assigned to anglico. How does that work? Well?

1196
01:26:17.70 --> 01:26:19.06
it's it's

1197
01:26:19.06 --> 01:26:21.62
My guys were almost 100 artillery

1198
01:26:22.26 --> 01:26:25.14
Really? Yeah, just most anglico is artillery

1199
01:26:25.54 --> 01:26:29.30
They're not all there. There's because they serve as forward observers at some point

1200
01:26:29.30 --> 01:26:34.74
There's exactly right that experience with calling an air. Uh, I'm sorry calling for fire artillery call for fire

1201
01:26:35.22 --> 01:26:37.22
Um, and forward observers things like that

1202
01:26:37.54 --> 01:26:43.14
It's not some rule that it has to be artillery, but the thing that was crazy though is my team my so I had a 13 man team

1203
01:26:43.14 --> 01:26:49.30
My five of us that I stayed because we ended up doing missions as a small unit leader. I had three teams

1204
01:26:49.30 --> 01:26:51.30
I was one of those three teams

1205
01:26:51.62 --> 01:26:53.62
every one of my guys was

1206
01:26:54.18 --> 01:26:55.46
artillery

1207
01:26:55.46 --> 01:26:57.46
And it never deployed

1208
01:26:58.26 --> 01:27:00.26
So it's kind of crazy

1209
01:27:01.62 --> 01:27:04.10
That's wild. I'm glad you didn't know this back then

1210
01:27:04.66 --> 01:27:06.66
I didn't either

1211
01:27:06.66 --> 01:27:14.18
Damn you guys were pros though like we did all right man. Yeah, we did all right. That's freaking legit. It was pretty cool

1212
01:27:14.58 --> 01:27:16.82
Uh to be with you guys

1213
01:27:18.82 --> 01:27:26.02
Yeah, I mean that's wild except like thinking like randomly you and I would be just like out in a building somewhere in ramadi

1214
01:27:26.02 --> 01:27:29.62
And you're like telling him like hey, what do you got you're like telling me what's going on? I'm just

1215
01:27:30.26 --> 01:27:32.26
thinking you're a rifleman

1216
01:27:32.26 --> 01:27:34.26
Oh

1217
01:27:35.22 --> 01:27:38.98
That's pretty awesome. Uh next thing endurance

1218
01:27:40.34 --> 01:27:46.34
Endurance like courage has two distinct parts physical endurance means being able to function effectively when tired or in pain

1219
01:27:46.74 --> 01:27:50.18
Mental endurance is the ability to think straight when fatigue distressed or in pain

1220
01:27:51.38 --> 01:27:53.38
Demonstrated endurance brings

1221
01:27:53.54 --> 01:27:58.74
Respect from subordinates lack of endurance fails not only to set a proper example for subordinates to follow

1222
01:27:58.74 --> 01:28:02.10
But can also be mistaken for a lack of courage

1223
01:28:03.22 --> 01:28:06.66
You can increase both mental and physical endurance by doing the following

1224
01:28:08.42 --> 01:28:12.34
Avoiding excesses that lower both physical and mental stamina

1225
01:28:13.38 --> 01:28:15.38
keeping physically fit

1226
01:28:15.38 --> 01:28:21.22
By exercise and proper diet check learning to stand discomfort by undertaking hard physical tasks check

1227
01:28:21.54 --> 01:28:25.30
Forcing yourself to study when you are tired and your mind is sluggish check

1228
01:28:25.30 --> 01:28:30.10
Finishing every job regardless of obstacles. So there you go. Good to go. We support

1229
01:28:32.42 --> 01:28:35.38
On set next one is unselfishness

1230
01:28:36.02 --> 01:28:38.98
The unselfish leader is one who gives credit where credit is due

1231
01:28:39.22 --> 01:28:43.70
Unselfishness means not taking advantage of a situation for personal gain at the expense of others

1232
01:28:44.10 --> 01:28:50.02
No subordinate can respect an nco who takes credit for jobs well done and blames other when performance is poor

1233
01:28:50.58 --> 01:28:51.54
check

1234
01:28:51.54 --> 01:28:57.22
An unselfish marine nco will ensure subordinates needs come before personal needs check

1235
01:28:58.74 --> 01:29:03.06
To develop your trade of unselfishness you should do the following see that subordinates have the best

1236
01:29:03.38 --> 01:29:08.26
That can be obtained for them under the circumstances try to understand the problems

1237
01:29:09.14 --> 01:29:12.10
military or personal of subordinates, um,

1238
01:29:12.66 --> 01:29:16.10
David Belavia he told he told that story about um, his like

1239
01:29:16.10 --> 01:29:22.18
Battalion sergeant major and they're like out in the street and his battalion sergeant major has an old

1240
01:29:22.90 --> 01:29:24.74
m16 with iron sights on it

1241
01:29:24.74 --> 01:29:26.50
And everyone else has got like the high speed stuff

1242
01:29:27.06 --> 01:29:33.38
And he like that's what David Belavia remembered is that his command sergeant major who was killed in combat

1243
01:29:33.62 --> 01:29:37.06
What he remembered about him is like he wouldn't take the good weapon

1244
01:29:38.02 --> 01:29:38.82
you know

1245
01:29:38.82 --> 01:29:39.86
that's

1246
01:29:39.86 --> 01:29:43.54
That like I remember thinking about that after he was on the podcast and I was like

1247
01:29:43.54 --> 01:29:47.46
That's what he remembered of all the things you remember you remember a bunch of other things

1248
01:29:47.46 --> 01:29:50.26
But like think of how much that stands out. He like this guy

1249
01:29:50.98 --> 01:29:56.18
He wouldn't take the good weapons from the troops even though he's the senior enlisted man in a freaking battalion

1250
01:29:56.90 --> 01:29:58.90
It might even have been a regimental sergeant major

1251
01:29:59.54 --> 01:30:01.54
but um, just awesome

1252
01:30:02.10 --> 01:30:04.90
Put the comfort pleasures and recreation of your subordinates before your own

1253
01:30:05.54 --> 01:30:09.78
In the field your marines eat before you do give credit to subordinates for jobs well done check

1254
01:30:11.86 --> 01:30:13.38
Loyalty

1255
01:30:13.38 --> 01:30:19.22
Loyalty is the quality of faithfulness to your country marine corps seniors and subordinates

1256
01:30:20.42 --> 01:30:22.98
Demonstrated loyalty wins respects and confidence

1257
01:30:24.18 --> 01:30:31.22
Loyalty means supporting the views and methods the unit employs, but doesn't mean becoming a yes man. Thank you. So there you go

1258
01:30:32.42 --> 01:30:34.58
We get a little bit of you know

1259
01:30:34.58 --> 01:30:37.94
Some of vietnam dude, you got a desert storm guy. Yeah, right? Yeah, yeah

1260
01:30:37.94 --> 01:30:39.94
Yeah, yeah

1261
01:30:41.70 --> 01:30:46.82
To develop loyalty you should do the following be quick to defend subordinates from abuse. Thank you

1262
01:30:48.58 --> 01:30:53.70
Never give the slightest hint of disagreement with orders from seniors when giving instruction to subordinates

1263
01:30:54.34 --> 01:30:56.34
Now I made a little note here

1264
01:30:57.62 --> 01:31:03.14
Because there was a I don't know if you remember this the very first trait that got covered was integrity

1265
01:31:04.18 --> 01:31:05.94
and it says

1266
01:31:05.94 --> 01:31:07.94
Be accurate truthful in all statements

1267
01:31:09.62 --> 01:31:14.02
Don't tell your superiors only what you think they want to hear tell it as it is but tactfully

1268
01:31:14.98 --> 01:31:21.30
Practice absolute honesty at all times not only with yourself, but with others never shade the truth

1269
01:31:21.70 --> 01:31:23.70
So now just fyi

1270
01:31:24.02 --> 01:31:28.82
We're saying never give the slightest hint of disagreement with orders from seniors when giving instructions to subordinates

1271
01:31:29.38 --> 01:31:35.14
So it's like we understand the caveat that we're throwing on there. Here's the problem. This is not a good plan

1272
01:31:35.14 --> 01:31:37.14
It's not

1273
01:31:37.54 --> 01:31:39.54
First of all because the team will see through it

1274
01:31:39.70 --> 01:31:41.70
Because you're telling them to do something that doesn't make sense

1275
01:31:41.70 --> 01:31:44.66
You know it doesn't make sense and if you know it doesn't make sense they're all gonna know it doesn't make sense

1276
01:31:45.38 --> 01:31:48.82
Okay, maybe they all know but you got a platoon of 40 guys

1277
01:31:49.30 --> 01:31:53.94
12 of them know nine of them know nine of them are looking at you like you're a jackass and we don't believe you

1278
01:31:54.98 --> 01:31:56.58
So how do we make this happen?

1279
01:31:56.82 --> 01:32:02.34
It goes back to earlier when we're when we're talking and we develop a relationship with our boss so that we can say

1280
01:32:02.34 --> 01:32:07.22
Hey boss, can you explain to me why we're doing this and if you have a good relationship with them and something doesn't make sense

1281
01:32:07.86 --> 01:32:12.98
Either they can explain it to you so it does make sense or you can explain the ramifications that are going to occur

1282
01:32:12.98 --> 01:32:18.18
And why this is a bad idea and if you still get the shut up and do what I told you you go down to the troops

1283
01:32:18.18 --> 01:32:23.78
You don't lie to them you go down troops and say hey fellas. Look. I pushed back against the boss. Here's what we're doing

1284
01:32:23.78 --> 01:32:28.98
Here's why we're doing it. We're gonna do the best of our ability and here's how we're gonna mitigate whatever problems might occur

1285
01:32:28.98 --> 01:32:31.46
That's what you do

1286
01:32:33.70 --> 01:32:36.42
I'm even thinking you know hack worth going on those patrols

1287
01:32:37.14 --> 01:32:40.58
Like there's even in that the whole the whole spectrum that's inside there of like all right

1288
01:32:40.66 --> 01:32:43.78
Jocko is the worst boss in the world. He's gonna order my guys to do something to get him killed

1289
01:32:45.54 --> 01:32:48.90
I can I can fall on my sword which is like the classic

1290
01:32:49.38 --> 01:32:50.58
It's like the um

1291
01:32:50.58 --> 01:32:54.10
What's the word I'm like the most romantic like oh that look Dave's gonna fall on his sword

1292
01:32:54.10 --> 01:32:57.22
I keep reminding people you know what happens when you fall on your sword you you fall on your sword

1293
01:32:57.22 --> 01:33:00.90
You die you die that's not good and then Dave gets replaced with

1294
01:33:01.54 --> 01:33:05.30
Echoes like whatever you say boss and in that case like all right. We're gonna go on that patrol

1295
01:33:07.54 --> 01:33:08.50
These are dumb

1296
01:33:08.50 --> 01:33:12.18
So what I'm gonna go outside the wire. I'm gonna set up this bim come on. Hey, we got no contact today

1297
01:33:12.50 --> 01:33:14.74
So even you've been talking even the spectrum inside there

1298
01:33:14.74 --> 01:33:19.46
But the thing of it is that you I think the key takeaway from that because the truth of the matter is most of the time

1299
01:33:20.02 --> 01:33:24.82
You're not getting these orders gonna get your people killed. No that's such a rare like an extreme example

1300
01:33:24.82 --> 01:33:26.82
Most of the time it's just like dumb

1301
01:33:27.62 --> 01:33:32.02
Okay, nobody's gonna die. It's not gonna ruin the company, but it's dumb inside there

1302
01:33:33.86 --> 01:33:39.70
If I come back and go hey, jog. Hey guys, this is the best idea ever boss is awesome and we're gonna go do this

1303
01:33:40.34 --> 01:33:43.86
I'm gonna lose so much leadership capital leader which credibility, but I can't say hey listen

1304
01:33:44.42 --> 01:33:47.06
I know this can be frustrating sometimes. I know sometimes it makes sense

1305
01:33:47.62 --> 01:33:49.46
Here's what we're gonna do. Here's why let me explain it

1306
01:33:50.02 --> 01:33:52.26
And if it's not gonna get anybody killed for any risk

1307
01:33:52.26 --> 01:33:58.18
They'll still do it, but the reason they're doing it is not undying obedience to your leadership. It's actually that you are

1308
01:33:58.98 --> 01:34:01.78
Being honest with them. You have integrity got integrity exactly

1309
01:34:01.78 --> 01:34:07.54
And so even that that deck that definitions how they're even understanding that there's a balance even inside that concept

1310
01:34:08.26 --> 01:34:10.26
I remember uh

1311
01:34:10.26 --> 01:34:14.42
Getting told there's two two two good examples of this one of them is from um

1312
01:34:16.26 --> 01:34:20.58
Bandit brothers when they send the recon across the river someone gets killed

1313
01:34:20.58 --> 01:34:24.02
They come back the next night the colonel's like hey send someone send another recon tonight

1314
01:34:24.02 --> 01:34:25.86
And he's like hey, I don't think that's a good idea. He's like shut up and do it

1315
01:34:25.86 --> 01:34:29.06
He says okay, and they go sit in the basement of the towing and drink wine

1316
01:34:29.86 --> 01:34:33.70
There was I heard this story when I was a new guy that you know in vietnam

1317
01:34:33.94 --> 01:34:37.78
These guys got told hey, you're gonna go out and do a patrol in this area and they or set up an ambush in this area

1318
01:34:37.78 --> 01:34:40.26
And they're like hey, that's a bad area. There's not gonna be anything and they're like no shut up and do it

1319
01:34:40.26 --> 01:34:43.62
And he goes okay cool. Yep. Whatever the platoon commander says cool got it

1320
01:34:43.86 --> 01:34:46.58
They went patrolled, you know 200 yards outside the gate

1321
01:34:46.58 --> 01:34:51.30
Sat in the bushes for five hours patrol back in hey no no contact didn't say anything

1322
01:34:51.30 --> 01:34:55.94
Yeah, I just said that associated with hackworth, but that I'm misplacing that it's the story

1323
01:34:55.94 --> 01:34:59.30
It's that story that you told of like okay, I don't know why I connected to hackworth

1324
01:34:59.30 --> 01:35:04.02
But it was that those patrols of like boss says to do this. I'm gonna go do this, but I'm actually not really doing it

1325
01:35:04.02 --> 01:35:09.86
Yeah, that's that's exactly what it was it came from from the story you told right and that isn't like look that is

1326
01:35:10.58 --> 01:35:14.02
Now we're now we're starting to develop some issues, right? Yep. Now we got some issues

1327
01:35:14.02 --> 01:35:16.26
We got some issues because now we're

1328
01:35:17.14 --> 01:35:20.74
We're giving false information up the chain of command

1329
01:35:20.74 --> 01:35:27.14
So now we're in just as bad of a spot as good doing down. So that is not the right answer totally

1330
01:35:27.70 --> 01:35:29.62
The right answer is to develop that relationship

1331
01:35:29.62 --> 01:35:32.98
But what you're talking about you said use the term in extremist people gonna get killed

1332
01:35:33.14 --> 01:35:35.30
So if we talk in an extremist people gonna get killed

1333
01:35:36.98 --> 01:35:42.98
I'm not gonna get my guys killed if it doesn't make sense. Yeah, so but that like you said this is not like

1334
01:35:42.98 --> 01:35:47.70
Oh another day in the military got ordered to do something that's gonna get about that doesn't I got asked this the other day

1335
01:35:47.70 --> 01:35:50.98
I just guy pulled me aside after an event and he's like, you know, what are you doing?

1336
01:35:50.98 --> 01:35:54.98
You get ordered to do something that is you know immoral and I was like, oh, don't do it

1337
01:35:55.62 --> 01:36:00.34
He was oh, you just don't do it. I was like, no, you can't do things that are immoral unethical or illegal

1338
01:36:00.34 --> 01:36:02.74
You can't do them as a matter of fact. I said it's your duty not to do them

1339
01:36:03.22 --> 01:36:06.90
A general order of the century says you must obey all lawful orders

1340
01:36:07.54 --> 01:36:11.22
It's if there's things that are unlawful you don't do them. In fact, you have to not do them

1341
01:36:11.22 --> 01:36:15.38
And he was kind of looking at me surprised. He goes, well, how often did that happen? I go it never happened exactly

1342
01:36:15.94 --> 01:36:19.78
Never actually zero times in 20 years and that's that's really the point

1343
01:36:20.26 --> 01:36:22.82
Center to the point I was trying to make is we create this like

1344
01:36:23.62 --> 01:36:27.94
We create some story that I'm being told by this awful evil boss is trying to get all my people killed

1345
01:36:27.94 --> 01:36:29.78
And how do I handle that like?

1346
01:36:29.78 --> 01:36:34.90
That never happened to me. Yeah, has it happened in history? Yeah, I guess it does and then inside that

1347
01:36:35.54 --> 01:36:38.90
But from your perspective or from the point you're making from a leadership standpoint

1348
01:36:38.90 --> 01:36:42.98
If if I've done all these other things right and I got a good relationship with my boss, jaco

1349
01:36:43.46 --> 01:36:46.42
Hey, what are you? What are the chances again? Hey, Dave? I got this unethical thing. I want you to go

1350
01:36:46.58 --> 01:36:50.66
It's not gonna happen. I gotta I gotta plan. I want you to go actually it's a bunch of people gonna get wounded to kill

1351
01:36:50.74 --> 01:36:54.42
Go ahead and execute it. Totally. So those those scenarios and I have no reason why right?

1352
01:36:54.90 --> 01:36:57.46
They don't and they don't just sit by themselves. That doesn't just happen

1353
01:36:58.02 --> 01:37:00.10
Uh, so we want to avoid the idea that like

1354
01:37:00.74 --> 01:37:04.42
Or what do you do in this case? Well, that never happened to me, but that didn't happen

1355
01:37:04.50 --> 01:37:07.06
I never once had a relationship with my boss by which he said hey come here

1356
01:37:07.06 --> 01:37:10.66
Half your people are gonna die. It serves no purpose, but I want you to go

1357
01:37:11.22 --> 01:37:16.10
Come on man. Like we're not doing that. Hey, Dave, you know what? This is gonna cost the company a bunch of money

1358
01:37:16.18 --> 01:37:19.14
It's gonna give us a bad reputation and we're probably gonna get some people to quit

1359
01:37:19.38 --> 01:37:22.26
Yeah, I want you to go and execute this right and you're like cool. Got it

1360
01:37:23.62 --> 01:37:26.90
Stuff doesn't happen. Um, but that's also why truth

1361
01:37:27.06 --> 01:37:32.82
That's the leading trait here was integrity up and down the chain of commands. So we like that. Yes, um

1362
01:37:32.82 --> 01:37:37.54
Practice doing every task the best your ability wholeheartedly support your commander's decisions

1363
01:37:37.70 --> 01:37:43.70
How do you best support your commander's decisions by guiding your commander and pushing back against your commander when something doesn't make sense

1364
01:37:43.78 --> 01:37:47.86
And getting on board with the little things that aren't gonna matter that much totally you tell me to do something

1365
01:37:47.94 --> 01:37:52.18
I'm gonna do it man. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna get it done. I'm gonna kick ass at it

1366
01:37:52.98 --> 01:37:56.02
If you tell me to do something that's totally stupid, I'm not gonna let you make that mistake

1367
01:37:56.02 --> 01:38:00.42
That's how I'm gonna wholeheartedly support you by being smart and having good relationship with my boss

1368
01:38:00.42 --> 01:38:04.18
Never discuss the personal problems of subordinates with others cool

1369
01:38:05.22 --> 01:38:09.54
Stand for your country the Marine Corps your unit and your fellow Marines when they are unjustly accused check

1370
01:38:09.86 --> 01:38:12.26
Never criticize seniors in the presence of subordinates

1371
01:38:15.62 --> 01:38:17.62
Check with a caveat

1372
01:38:18.82 --> 01:38:22.74
You know, like you said if you're doing something if you're being told to do something that doesn't make sense

1373
01:38:22.74 --> 01:38:28.58
But it's not worth quote falling on your sword over. It's like, hey, listen. Here's why we're doing this

1374
01:38:28.58 --> 01:38:31.54
I know it's not maybe the best way to get it done

1375
01:38:31.70 --> 01:38:34.82
But in order to develop a better relationship with the boss and gain more caught with him

1376
01:38:34.82 --> 01:38:40.58
We're gonna go ahead and execute this. We're gonna wear our freaking dress uniform tonight and everyone's like, you gotta be kidding me

1377
01:38:41.38 --> 01:38:46.58
Yep, I wish I was kidding you, but I'm not yeah, we're gonna and you know what we're all gonna look so sharp that

1378
01:38:47.14 --> 01:38:50.34
The boss is gonna know that we're the platoon that can get that's such a great example

1379
01:38:50.42 --> 01:38:53.94
Because those are the it's like boss wants the paperwork done 12 hours ahead of the due date

1380
01:38:54.26 --> 01:38:56.82
You know like oh come on like guys listen

1381
01:38:56.82 --> 01:39:02.02
That's the those are the scenarios where your uniform you don't want to wear getting paperwork done

1382
01:39:02.66 --> 01:39:05.54
Those are the far more realistic scenarios you had to come down and go. Hey guys

1383
01:39:05.70 --> 01:39:07.06
I know it's a little bit frustrating

1384
01:39:07.06 --> 01:39:13.38
But as opposed to boss is sending us on the suicide mission with no benefit. That's not that's not the scenario

1385
01:39:13.38 --> 01:39:15.38
That's more likely. It's the one you used to describe like

1386
01:39:16.42 --> 01:39:20.66
Guys, I know you don't want to do this. I know sometimes this comes out. It could be kind of frustrating

1387
01:39:20.66 --> 01:39:26.50
But we're gonna do this and here's why and and if you got a good relationship to your people most of the time I'm gonna go

1388
01:39:26.82 --> 01:39:30.90
Okay, fine. No worries, Dave. We got your back and they're gonna just get it done. It's not that big of a deal

1389
01:39:31.06 --> 01:39:37.30
I just remembered at stoner's funeral in hawaii. There was some guy that was there

1390
01:39:37.70 --> 01:39:41.62
I want to say was in hawaii who was stationed on the ship with stoner

1391
01:39:42.34 --> 01:39:49.30
And the stoner was in charge of like I don't even know he's in charge of um like some department on the ship and

1392
01:39:49.30 --> 01:39:52.66
they pulled into port and

1393
01:39:53.46 --> 01:39:57.14
Stoner like gave the liberty brief. He's like, hey you guys, you know like liberty go go

1394
01:39:57.46 --> 01:40:00.82
Don't get in trouble and they were all like, damn we don't have any duties or whatever

1395
01:40:01.14 --> 01:40:04.66
And as they got this guy he said they were leaving the ship and they looked like

1396
01:40:05.30 --> 01:40:11.30
Wherever on the ship and stoner was there like doing the duty that they all had to do like they had to clean something to do

1397
01:40:11.30 --> 01:40:16.18
Someone and he was up there just like doing it by himself and I was like, I can dig the dude was so freaking

1398
01:40:16.18 --> 01:40:20.10
And like pumped, you know, um, that's taking care of your people

1399
01:40:20.74 --> 01:40:25.54
Uh, never criticize. Oh, yeah, never criticize your seniors and friends and support us. Yeah, check

1400
01:40:26.10 --> 01:40:30.82
Do not discuss command problems outside the unit check be loyal to your seniors and subordinates. Check

1401
01:40:31.54 --> 01:40:35.94
Support the lawful policies of senior officers. Whether you personally agree with them or not

1402
01:40:36.82 --> 01:40:38.82
Loyalty is a two-way street

1403
01:40:39.54 --> 01:40:41.54
What I would ask you to do

1404
01:40:41.54 --> 01:40:48.58
Is not to support the lawful policies of senior officers whether you personally agree what I would ask you to do is understand them I

1405
01:40:49.14 --> 01:40:54.64
Would ask you to understand why your boss wants you to wear a uniform on a Tuesday night

1406
01:40:54.64 --> 01:40:57.28
I would want you to understand why your boss wants you to

1407
01:40:58.04 --> 01:41:04.000
Turn the weapons it at a certain time before good ball, you know like understand and give them the benefit of that out

1408
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.16
That's that's that's a little bonus too because you could be super critical about everything and nothing makes it if you want to be

1409
01:41:09.16 --> 01:41:13.64
Hypercritical literally nothing makes sense in the military. It's all freaking. It's all just dumb

1410
01:41:14.26 --> 01:41:16.26
So if you want to go level 12

1411
01:41:16.74 --> 01:41:19.44
Hypercritical and it's the same thing in any company you go

1412
01:41:19.44 --> 01:41:23.74
We I could go to some company right now and start talking to the subordinate

1413
01:41:23.82 --> 01:41:30.30
Teams start talking to the frontline personnel and we could get a list of stupid things that that company's doing and we could never stop

1414
01:41:30.30 --> 01:41:31.90
writing them down

1415
01:41:31.90 --> 01:41:36.12
So instead of looking for what's stupid try and understand why these things are happening

1416
01:41:36.12 --> 01:41:38.12
And this is the last one judgment

1417
01:41:38.76 --> 01:41:40.76
judgment is the ability

1418
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.36
To logically weigh facts and possible solutions on

1419
01:41:45.08 --> 01:41:51.08
Which to base sound decisions and includes common sense when faced with a new problem or information you don't understand

1420
01:41:52.04 --> 01:41:56.68
Seek advice before you attempt a solution. It isn't degrading to ask questions

1421
01:41:58.20 --> 01:42:00.20
Note to self

1422
01:42:00.52 --> 01:42:04.20
In leadership strategy and tactics one of the things that a leader supposed to do is to

1423
01:42:04.20 --> 01:42:06.20
Ask questions

1424
01:42:06.76 --> 01:42:11.56
It is embarrassing to arrive at a poor solution because of the lack of judgment to seek help

1425
01:42:12.12 --> 01:42:17.24
To develop the trade of judgment. You should do the following practice making estimates of the situation

1426
01:42:17.24 --> 01:42:20.28
That's something you can do as a leader get your get your team members

1427
01:42:20.52 --> 01:42:24.68
Someone that you're trying to coach and mentor be like, hey echo. What do you think we should do right here?

1428
01:42:24.68 --> 01:42:29.48
What do you think's going on and talk have them talk you through it and you're gonna get better

1429
01:42:29.72 --> 01:42:33.72
You're gonna come up with a better solution anyways, but it finds a solution

1430
01:42:33.72 --> 01:42:38.12
But if I have echo try and come up with a solution to estimate the solution or estimate the situation come over the solution

1431
01:42:38.20 --> 01:42:42.52
Come up with a plan. I'm detached and I'll all of a sudden I get to see a different perspective that I didn't see before

1432
01:42:42.84 --> 01:42:44.36
So there's a little

1433
01:42:44.36 --> 01:42:46.36
A little bonus. There's a bonus to that

1434
01:42:48.36 --> 01:42:52.84
Anticipate situations which required decisions to be prepared when the need arises cool

1435
01:42:53.88 --> 01:42:57.24
Avoid making rash decisions. I like how they use the word avoid

1436
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.48
I would go strong like don't make rash decisions

1437
01:43:01.48 --> 01:43:05.32
And I wouldn't use the you know, you don't want to say never but

1438
01:43:06.28 --> 01:43:08.28
You need to go stronger than avoid

1439
01:43:09.32 --> 01:43:10.60
like

1440
01:43:10.60 --> 01:43:13.88
As often as possible avoid making rash decisions, right

1441
01:43:15.08 --> 01:43:18.84
Maybe even a little stronger than that. We'd have to break out the thesaurus and get busy to figure out where we're going

1442
01:43:19.72 --> 01:43:26.68
And the last one here approach problems with a common sense attitude, which may sound common sense

1443
01:43:27.24 --> 01:43:29.24
But sometimes it's not

1444
01:43:29.96 --> 01:43:31.40
um

1445
01:43:31.40 --> 01:43:33.40
There you go

1446
01:43:33.88 --> 01:43:35.64
Some more leadership. What do you got echo Charles?

1447
01:43:35.64 --> 01:43:43.000
You kind of rewind into that maybe to few one few lines ago when you know, let them come up with a plan or whatever

1448
01:43:43.16 --> 01:43:49.40
Just to give give them the the opportunity to exercise their capability. Whatever. Are you going in there with

1449
01:43:50.76 --> 01:43:55.88
Knowing where you're not going to use their plan and they know that or are you like maybe you come up with a good plan

1450
01:43:56.36 --> 01:43:58.20
If you come up with a plan that's like

1451
01:43:58.20 --> 01:44:00.76
Viable, yeah, sounds good to me, right? Yeah

1452
01:44:00.76 --> 01:44:04.52
If you come up if you come up with an idiot plan, we're not going to use it

1453
01:44:04.68 --> 01:44:07.16
But what are the chances of you coming up with an idiot plan?

1454
01:44:08.28 --> 01:44:14.36
If I said to you right now, you have no military experience if I was like, hey echo, we've got to attack this building

1455
01:44:15.56 --> 01:44:18.76
Yeah, you'd probably come up with a plan that was almost usable

1456
01:44:19.64 --> 01:44:23.88
Right, you'd be like, well, we should put some guys over here and maybe I give you a five minute class

1457
01:44:23.96 --> 01:44:25.96
Then you if I give you a five minute class

1458
01:44:26.04 --> 01:44:28.04
You could probably come up with a plan that we would execute

1459
01:44:28.04 --> 01:44:32.92
Yeah, and I'd be like cool sounds close enough. Okay, so so it's like the primary primary

1460
01:44:33.64 --> 01:44:39.96
Purpose for you doing that is to give them exercise, but completely open completely for for for that to be the jam

1461
01:44:40.04 --> 01:44:42.92
And as you know, this is like how I roll anyways

1462
01:44:42.92 --> 01:44:47.000
I mean this is like what I do all the time with everything. That's kind of why I was asking

1463
01:44:47.08 --> 01:44:49.16
Yeah, I'm like, are you like in your mind saying

1464
01:44:50.28 --> 01:44:56.04
But in case he does we'll go with it kind of a thing or because there's a difference between that and then really leaning on someone

1465
01:44:56.04 --> 01:44:59.80
For the plan like, you know, if it's clear that Dave knows more than

1466
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.64
You or me or whatever about something you're like, hey, we better go to Dave for this plan

1467
01:45:05.64 --> 01:45:07.56
You know, that's like leaning on him for it

1468
01:45:07.56 --> 01:45:11.88
But sometimes it's like unnecessary, but the primary isn't you want to give them an exercise?

1469
01:45:11.88 --> 01:45:15.16
So down the road or whatever they're going to be really good, but that's the primary purpose

1470
01:45:15.24 --> 01:45:21.88
You seem saying I don't even know if it's the primary purpose because when if Dave's working for me and he's a platoon commander

1471
01:45:21.96 --> 01:45:23.96
He's a project manager for me

1472
01:45:23.96 --> 01:45:27.40
And I go, hey Dave, how do you want to execute this?

1473
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Yes, he gets education

1474
01:45:31.16 --> 01:45:33.08
Yes, he gets to learn

1475
01:45:33.08 --> 01:45:37.72
But yes, he's probably gonna come up with a decent plan and as long as he comes up with a decent plan

1476
01:45:37.80 --> 01:45:42.52
We're probably gonna execute that thing. Maybe we got to make a couple adjustments, but that's kind of what we're doing

1477
01:45:42.52 --> 01:45:47.32
So it's a it's not even like hey if you're trying to change train someone right

1478
01:45:48.44 --> 01:45:50.76
If I'm working with someone I'm gonna

1479
01:45:51.56 --> 01:45:53.56
Try and let them come up with the plan

1480
01:45:53.56 --> 01:45:55.56
It's gonna make me

1481
01:45:55.56 --> 01:45:57.96
Better because when Dave comes up with a plan I

1482
01:45:58.60 --> 01:46:03.24
Look, I have a plan in my head right? I've got something even if I look at a target for three seconds

1483
01:46:03.24 --> 01:46:06.92
Or I look at a project for three seconds. I go. Yeah, I know what I do here as soon as I ask Dave

1484
01:46:06.92 --> 01:46:08.92
I get a whole totally different perspective

1485
01:46:09.48 --> 01:46:11.48
And so and and by the way

1486
01:46:11.80 --> 01:46:14.04
Dave only sees what Dave sees

1487
01:46:14.76 --> 01:46:17.08
So now when I say throw something out there

1488
01:46:17.40 --> 01:46:19.40
He's like oh and it's like

1489
01:46:19.40 --> 01:46:23.96
Like building my leadership capital because I'm listening to him, but I also have good ideas myself

1490
01:46:24.52 --> 01:46:26.52
It's just a win win win win

1491
01:46:26.68 --> 01:46:28.68
across the board

1492
01:46:30.12 --> 01:46:32.12
So

1493
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.80
Fundamentals of marine leadership Dave Burke there you go you handed me this manual

1494
01:46:38.92 --> 01:46:42.28
We got some good. We got some bad. We got some ugly. We only covered a little bit of it

1495
01:46:42.28 --> 01:46:46.76
I don't know if we're gonna dig back into this thing, but uh the important thing is to

1496
01:46:46.76 --> 01:46:48.76
Always dig see what you can find

1497
01:46:49.32 --> 01:46:53.88
What do you got anything else? No, I think we said it. I mean inside there like I said

1498
01:46:55.08 --> 01:47:01.32
I in every case I was thinking myself. I understand what you're saying, but so that's all good to go

1499
01:47:01.80 --> 01:47:05.64
I actually I'm actually interested and see if there's like a new like an updated version

1500
01:47:05.64 --> 01:47:11.80
You know the the 2017 version of this that has you know, 17 years or 16 years of combat experience inside there

1501
01:47:11.80 --> 01:47:18.20
Um, for me, it's kind of cool though the 14 leadership traits those those

1502
01:47:18.60 --> 01:47:24.28
You know, we called it JJ did type uncle. That's the acronym justice judgment decisiveness initiative

1503
01:47:24.76 --> 01:47:27.40
You know all those letters that go on you know that you talked about

1504
01:47:28.04 --> 01:47:34.20
That has stood this test of time and as you as you read what they meant. I'm like, that's right. That's right. That's right

1505
01:47:34.20 --> 01:47:41.08
It also I think gets to the explaining this stuff is harder than it seems and we talk about leadership all the time we teach

1506
01:47:41.72 --> 01:47:45.96
Some of the most rudimentary leadership behaviors in the world cover and move

1507
01:47:47.32 --> 01:47:54.60
Communication and yet we know how hard it is to do them and so inside this you get this sense of even

1508
01:47:55.48 --> 01:47:57.48
even for these folks

1509
01:47:57.56 --> 01:48:02.28
Understanding it and explaining it and being able to do it or very different things. The stuff is hard

1510
01:48:02.28 --> 01:48:04.28
Explaining it is hard

1511
01:48:04.68 --> 01:48:09.16
learning it and understanding it is so much harder than it is to just say it and

1512
01:48:10.52 --> 01:48:12.52
it was it's actually

1513
01:48:12.92 --> 01:48:19.96
cool to hear as as you're talking through that my leadership radar my leadership here like wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong

1514
01:48:20.68 --> 01:48:24.20
and to be able to pull out even some of the new ones inside there even like you said

1515
01:48:25.48 --> 01:48:29.72
Don't say avoid being a tyrannical leader. Don't be a tyrannical leader

1516
01:48:30.44 --> 01:48:32.20
and

1517
01:48:32.20 --> 01:48:33.64
this was

1518
01:48:33.64 --> 01:48:35.80
Had some fun with that, but this was cool to see that

1519
01:48:36.68 --> 01:48:40.68
I had this sense of this of someone struggling to articulate a concept they understood

1520
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.68
but didn't know how to teach it and didn't have the the um

1521
01:48:45.64 --> 01:48:52.20
The experience reservoir to go. Okay this concept now I can put meaning around this content concept based on my experience

1522
01:48:52.60 --> 01:48:54.60
I would say that

1523
01:48:55.88 --> 01:48:58.76
A little yes to that but also I would say that

1524
01:48:58.76 --> 01:49:00.76
That

1525
01:49:00.76 --> 01:49:04.04
Where I thought you were going with that is look you can read the word decisiveness

1526
01:49:04.92 --> 01:49:10.04
And you can understand you can understand what that means and I can understand what that means

1527
01:49:10.60 --> 01:49:12.60
But someone else apparently this guy

1528
01:49:14.04 --> 01:49:16.92
Thinks that decisiveness means you need to understand all the facts

1529
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
So even these things that we understand a certain way

1530
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:29.80
They're interpretation of what decisiveness means is different and quite frankly in some of these cases not correct

1531
01:49:30.04 --> 01:49:32.60
So they were able to take correct concepts

1532
01:49:33.72 --> 01:49:35.80
And teach them in a way that are incorrect

1533
01:49:36.76 --> 01:49:40.68
I don't think it had anything to do with not being able to

1534
01:49:41.32 --> 01:49:46.12
Express it or articulate it. I think they actually didn't understand the thing

1535
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:50.84
Yeah, what that actually what that actually means. I mean when you're talking about um

1536
01:49:51.80 --> 01:49:57.80
Some of those decentralized command that we're running kind of like flipping through to see some of those examples where I like wrote like no

1537
01:49:59.08 --> 01:50:04.12
Like like what we just said never give the slightest hint of disagreement with orders

1538
01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
when giving instructions to support it so

1539
01:50:07.48 --> 01:50:10.36
We're we're we're not telling the truth to our troops

1540
01:50:11.32 --> 01:50:13.000
loyalty

1541
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.28
I would focus on hey if you're loyal to your boss, you don't let them tell you to do something that may doesn't make any sense

1542
01:50:18.28 --> 01:50:20.52
That's not being loyal totally the opposite. Yeah, yeah

1543
01:50:20.84 --> 01:50:25.16
The last thing I want for loyalty from Dave Burke is I'm like hey Dave charge that machine gun nest

1544
01:50:25.88 --> 01:50:27.88
With your squad elevated position

1545
01:50:28.12 --> 01:50:31.40
Go the last thing I want from you to see you yes, sir in charge

1546
01:50:31.80 --> 01:50:37.40
I want you to be loyal to you to your troops and loyal to me by saying hey boss. This is dumb

1547
01:50:38.04 --> 01:50:40.84
We need to lay down cover fire and we'll maneuver around the outside. So

1548
01:50:40.84 --> 01:50:47.56
So there's some there's some swings and some misses which is very interesting. I was thinking this I started thinking about this

1549
01:50:47.56 --> 01:50:48.52
I'm like

1550
01:50:48.52 --> 01:50:54.92
Is was this thing like the navy achievement medal of some like some like lieutenant colonel or major that was like

1551
01:50:55.56 --> 01:50:56.84
oh

1552
01:50:56.84 --> 01:51:01.64
We wrote the marine corps fundamental like and he just kind of that was his project. He got after it, you know

1553
01:51:01.88 --> 01:51:06.76
Yeah, I wish the same with all the ones I wish you could have just been in the room

1554
01:51:06.76 --> 01:51:12.84
Because there's shades there's little peaks of that guy nailed it whoever that guy was like you went through that one

1555
01:51:12.84 --> 01:51:18.76
You're like nailed it. Yeah, you almost have the sense like that's someone who understands it and got his

1556
01:51:19.48 --> 01:51:24.60
Fragments of this thing in this pub. Yep, where's the other guy who doesn't understand it got his fragments in and when you put them

1557
01:51:24.60 --> 01:51:26.60
So I'm like yep nope

1558
01:51:26.84 --> 01:51:30.92
You know it's what you were talking about being on paper versus being on target, right?

1559
01:51:30.92 --> 01:51:37.16
And this this this has happened to us at echelon front where we get a leader we go and work with the leadership team

1560
01:51:38.04 --> 01:51:40.04
and they take a principle

1561
01:51:40.76 --> 01:51:42.52
And we check in with them, you know three weeks later

1562
01:51:42.52 --> 01:51:49.08
We'll go back there and you can see this one person. They're on paper, but man, they're not hitting the mark

1563
01:51:49.80 --> 01:51:51.80
and you know for them

1564
01:51:52.36 --> 01:51:56.12
Extreme ownership meant I'm going to dictate everything that's happening here

1565
01:51:56.12 --> 01:52:02.76
Or decentralized command meant I can go to the Bahamas for the next two weeks on vacation because I'm gonna let my team so

1566
01:52:03.16 --> 01:52:07.96
They take it and interpret it the wrong way. Yeah, so this stuff

1567
01:52:09.40 --> 01:52:13.40
There's there's probably you just like just like shooting like there's a chance

1568
01:52:13.40 --> 01:52:16.84
You know I would take Dave and get you dialed in at 300 yards on your rifle

1569
01:52:17.16 --> 01:52:19.96
You're gonna do pretty good if I take a group of a hundred people and do that

1570
01:52:20.04 --> 01:52:23.16
How many have some people that cannot that aren't gonna be hitting paper? Yep

1571
01:52:23.16 --> 01:52:28.20
And so that's what we have to watch out for and that's you know, what's interesting about working at echelon front like

1572
01:52:29.16 --> 01:52:31.16
Because we do this all the time

1573
01:52:34.04 --> 01:52:39.24
Like we we we know and we also have the ability to go up. Yep. This person's gonna be a little bit off target

1574
01:52:39.24 --> 01:52:43.80
Hey, two clicks to the right one click down. We're gonna get you dialed in bullseye on this stuff

1575
01:52:44.44 --> 01:52:49.64
And even that can be hard. There's some people there. They're they're they're praying spray. Some people have the vision of

1576
01:52:49.64 --> 01:52:54.92
You know, finally jocco is gonna come to my company get everyone in line. It's like everyone. Yeah

1577
01:52:55.40 --> 01:52:57.56
It's like no, it's not quite gonna go like that

1578
01:52:58.44 --> 01:53:00.92
So when I read all these things

1579
01:53:03.24 --> 01:53:08.60
Keeping an open mind about what you're reading what you're interpreting about what you're understanding

1580
01:53:09.32 --> 01:53:15.24
Thinking that you know, even when someone presents me tomorrow afternoon. I'm working with a company and someone says

1581
01:53:15.24 --> 01:53:22.04
Hey, jocco, I don't think cover and move works. I don't think to myself. Hey, shut up. You don't know what you're talking about

1582
01:53:22.04 --> 01:53:24.60
I know I know I go talk to me about why not

1583
01:53:25.72 --> 01:53:27.56
What is the situation?

1584
01:53:27.56 --> 01:53:29.56
so keeping an open mind and

1585
01:53:30.12 --> 01:53:32.12
Not thinking that you know everything

1586
01:53:32.60 --> 01:53:34.60
is is extremely important

1587
01:53:35.16 --> 01:53:37.000
and even

1588
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.60
Dictating right that's what I think one thing that sat a little bit wrong about this

1589
01:53:42.60 --> 01:53:48.84
This this book for both of us is there is a lot of dictating the way things are with

1590
01:53:49.48 --> 01:53:56.92
With no outs with no deviations and that's always problematic. It's always problematic to paint yourself into a corner

1591
01:53:57.08 --> 01:53:59.96
It's always problematic to carve things into stone. Yeah

1592
01:54:00.68 --> 01:54:04.68
There should be some things carved in stone very few the things that you carve in stone

1593
01:54:05.80 --> 01:54:11.16
They should be very very few and even when you carve them into stone you should be able to move that rock around a little bit

1594
01:54:11.16 --> 01:54:18.76
Yeah, I think that's an awesome metaphor and then the other word that that certainly triggered a response of me is the concept of control

1595
01:54:19.24 --> 01:54:23.16
How this is about controlling like and we both that word are like wow that that

1596
01:54:23.88 --> 01:54:30.52
But even conceptually like if you are if you in your mind think this this is a tool or technique to control people

1597
01:54:31.08 --> 01:54:36.28
Your interpretation is going to be wrong because even the outcome that you're trying to achieve or even what leadership really is

1598
01:54:36.28 --> 01:54:41.96
You've got and you talk about different perspectives if the perspective is this is a tool to control other people

1599
01:54:42.28 --> 01:54:45.56
You've got this wrong. Yeah, and that was the other word that really hit me like man

1600
01:54:45.56 --> 01:54:49.32
That's that is not what we're trying to achieve here if you're like throwing out

1601
01:54:49.32 --> 01:54:54.04
Hey, if you got to be authoritarian deal, there's time to play. Hey, and you know what is there? Yeah, sure

1602
01:54:54.44 --> 01:54:55.64
There's a time in a place

1603
01:54:55.64 --> 01:54:59.96
There's a time that there's an emergency going on people don't know what's happening and you got to get up and be like

1604
01:55:00.04 --> 01:55:02.84
Hey, everyone be quiet. We're moving over to this thing that happens

1605
01:55:03.64 --> 01:55:04.76
but

1606
01:55:04.76 --> 01:55:06.76
It shouldn't be happening a lot. So

1607
01:55:07.72 --> 01:55:09.72
There you go leadership

1608
01:55:09.96 --> 01:55:11.40
Lessons learned

1609
01:55:11.40 --> 01:55:14.28
Thank you marine corps. You know marine corps

1610
01:55:15.16 --> 01:55:18.20
You're my people. So I know you're with me now

1611
01:55:18.84 --> 01:55:21.56
We just had to we had to dispel some stuff in this one

1612
01:55:22.20 --> 01:55:27.96
Uh, appreciate it. What else what else we got echo people getting we're getting smarter. We are we're keeping an open mind

1613
01:55:28.12 --> 01:55:33.56
We are we are trying to yes, so we're on the path. We're avoid keeping in a clothesline

1614
01:55:33.56 --> 01:55:40.52
I'll tell you that definitely a good thing doing our best to avoid that. Uh, yes, so, you know, we're on this improvement path

1615
01:55:41.48 --> 01:55:43.32
growth path

1616
01:55:43.32 --> 01:55:47.08
And we need supplementation sometimes the jocobo supplements is we're gonna talk about first

1617
01:55:47.88 --> 01:55:54.28
So additional protein in the form of a dessert short description. Yeah, same thing. It's called milk. You did it

1618
01:55:54.52 --> 01:55:56.68
Yeah, it's its own thing. Yeah, it is

1619
01:55:56.68 --> 01:56:03.56
Um, also energy drinks, but they're not regular energy drinks. They're good energy drinks boom called go

1620
01:56:04.52 --> 01:56:10.04
That's gonna help us on our mental and physical path as well. Yeah creatine speaking of physical bringing it back

1621
01:56:10.92 --> 01:56:16.12
Studied proven for improved performance results gains all that

1622
01:56:17.08 --> 01:56:18.20
Oh, yeah

1623
01:56:18.20 --> 01:56:23.24
That's true. Actually, you know, I there. I only had a small stint of creatine. Oh really? Yeah

1624
01:56:23.24 --> 01:56:29.48
Yeah, it was I guess not so coincidentally the strongest I've ever been though in the weight room. See yeah

1625
01:56:30.04 --> 01:56:35.88
Well, you go scientifically proven and bro scientifically proven. Yeah, I just never was that into supplements

1626
01:56:36.04 --> 01:56:41.64
Yeah, and then yeah, maybe I should have been I don't know, but I got some creatine now though got called up now

1627
01:56:41.88 --> 01:56:43.72
So we're back in the game. Yeah

1628
01:56:43.72 --> 01:56:46.44
Um, also what else we got joint health keep your joints

1629
01:56:46.44 --> 01:56:53.32
So you pretty much everything for every every supplement for pretty much any part of our path. We got you we got you

1630
01:56:53.56 --> 01:56:56.12
Not to mention some new stuff coming out. I'm not gonna talk about that

1631
01:56:56.12 --> 01:57:01.64
I'm not gonna pop the hype bubble on the new thing. Yeah, but there's some new keep the hype bubble some new

1632
01:57:04.28 --> 01:57:07.72

1639
01:57:29.32 --> 01:57:36.76
Yeah, those monk rtds are like yeah, and you don't really understand like how good they are until you really have them

1640
01:57:36.84 --> 01:57:40.92
Because they're only good on paper. Yeah, it's funny as we're using the expression on paper

1641
01:57:40.92 --> 01:57:43.40
because you know on paper usually means like um

1642
01:57:44.76 --> 01:57:49.48
It makes sense if you do the equation on paper, but in real life on paper

1643
01:57:49.56 --> 01:57:53.88
Yeah, real life or in the field or whatever is different or whatever. So that's what I mean by this one, but

1644
01:57:54.76 --> 01:57:58.52
So on paper, you're like, okay. Yeah, cool rtd. You don't got to mix it up or whatever

1645
01:57:58.52 --> 01:58:01.96
But that element of it is a big deal when you really have them

1646
01:58:02.36 --> 01:58:07.16
This bro. I'm just sucking them down. Yeah, it's a little too easy. Yeah, like you're like drinking like four of them

1647
01:58:07.32 --> 01:58:10.04
Yeah in a day 120 sometimes

1648
01:58:10.04 --> 01:58:12.04

01:58:59.16 --> 01:59:03.16
I don't think so. Did you wear bell bottoms? No, I'm a man

1662
01:59:03.16 --> 01:59:05.16
I

1663
01:59:05.40 --> 01:59:09.48
Whatever brother this actually know when I wore bell bottoms in the navy in the navy

1664
01:59:09.64 --> 01:59:14.36
Well, when I went to boot camp you had to wear these things called dungarees. They don't wear them anymore and they were

1665
01:59:14.76 --> 01:59:16.44
They were bell bottoms

1666
01:59:16.44 --> 01:59:17.56
They were

1667
01:59:17.56 --> 01:59:20.92
But it was so lame. It was the lamest uniform ever

1668
01:59:21.24 --> 01:59:26.12
Okay, so you weren't down with them. We call them dunger jams because they call them dungarees in the navy

1669
01:59:26.12 --> 01:59:31.40
We call them dunger jams and buds and you were so happy to get out of those things, but you remember higgs

1670
01:59:31.40 --> 01:59:34.68
Yeah, Jeff Higgs. So he got dropped from training

1671
01:59:35.40 --> 01:59:37.72
And they took away his buds uniform

1672
01:59:38.52 --> 01:59:45.08
And they put him back in his dunger jams and he was he wouldn't they want they dropped him and he was not leaving

1673
01:59:45.24 --> 01:59:47.24
And he would just show up to pt

1674
01:59:47.40 --> 01:59:50.60
Like the class would come out and he'd go with them and the instructors were like, dude

1675
01:59:50.68 --> 01:59:54.76
You can't be out here and he would just like ignore them and then they would like escort him out of there

1676
01:59:55.56 --> 01:59:58.84
And then the then they'd be like dude, you'd like you can't be here like you wait

1677
01:59:58.84 --> 02:00:04.04
And he had his dunger jams on. Yep. That's what you're saying. Just like dude. I'm staying with the class whatever fools

1678
02:00:04.68 --> 02:00:08.76
And they they dropped him and and then finally like he just stuck with it

1679
02:00:08.76 --> 02:00:13.96
He just was not quitting and then finally they're like, all right, dude. This guy's a badass. We need to keep them

1680
02:00:14.84 --> 02:00:16.84
You know

1681
02:00:18.36 --> 02:00:19.64
Yeah, they would like

1682
02:00:19.64 --> 02:00:25.32
They would get him away from the class and then they'd send him to you know, lock him in a room somewhere and he'd like break out and then he'd get back

1683
02:00:25.32 --> 02:00:28.76
He was just freaking not quitting

1684
02:00:30.28 --> 02:00:33.96
With the dunger jams. Yep. All right, so no bell, but okay, I understand

1685
02:00:34.44 --> 02:00:37.80
That may be the first time I think I've ever like try to answer a question for jocos

1686
02:00:37.88 --> 02:00:40.44
I'll look more like shaking my head. No, I usually just sit here and listen

1687
02:00:40.68 --> 02:00:44.44
But he said bell bottoms on look at you. I'm like, I'm shaking my head. No before you say no

1688
02:00:44.44 --> 02:00:48.04
I don't think I've ever done that before but that one just like I'm like, no

1689
02:00:48.76 --> 02:00:51.80
That's not happening put this way. I was not surprised with your answer

1690
02:00:51.80 --> 02:00:56.76
But sometimes you just never know. I'm seeing hey, honestly the the enlisted navy uniform

1691
02:00:57.24 --> 02:01:01.56
Dressed uniform. Those are bell bottoms too. I think they are right when those be classified. I mean, yeah

1692
02:01:01.64 --> 02:01:03.56
and I know what you're talking about and and

1693
02:01:03.56 --> 02:01:07.000
That's not what he's like the cracker jack cracker jack uniform. You know what that is

1694
02:01:07.16 --> 02:01:11.56
Like the dress blues for for a navy enlisted guy below the let rank of e

1695
02:01:12.76 --> 02:01:19.96
Six e six and below like you you look like a cracker jack box, you know, you look like a like a stereotypical sailor

1696
02:01:19.96 --> 02:01:25.16
Right. Yeah with the with the Dixie cup hat. They call it. Okay. Yeah. Is that the white?

1697
02:01:26.28 --> 02:01:27.64
Yeah

1698
02:01:27.64 --> 02:01:31.88
The flared out pants. Yeah the flare up kind of bell bottom is yeah bell bottom me for sure

1699
02:01:32.12 --> 02:01:37.000
Yeah, no, I was thinking like more disco days. So here's the thing. So jockey use born early 70s, right?

1700
02:01:37.16 --> 02:01:41.24
So when you're going to just roll deep maybe because look think about it's like four

1701
02:01:41.96 --> 02:01:44.60
I don't know after nine. I don't know 79. Right?

1702
02:01:44.60 --> 02:01:48.84
Oh, maybe maybe we have to inspect like old pictures and see if I ever had any role to

1703
02:01:49.80 --> 02:01:53.96
It's part of my point because right now if I'm like, hey, jockel like hairstyles and all this

1704
02:01:54.76 --> 02:01:59.32
Her styles hair is only to look good. So whatever I'm here to win. What was the speech you gave?

The police and law enforcement firefighters paramedics emt's dispatchers correctional officers border patrol secret service and all first responders

1762
02:06:23.24 --> 02:06:27.16
Thank you for keeping us safe with your leadership here on the home front

1763
02:06:28.84 --> 02:06:31.16
And everyone else out there one of the

1764
02:06:32.12 --> 02:06:37.24
traits of a leader spelled out in this marine corps manual was courage

1765
02:06:38.52 --> 02:06:41.64
And it talked about physical courage and it talked about moral courage

1766
02:06:41.64 --> 02:06:46.36
And it talked about the mental control of fear and the book gave some recommendations

1767
02:06:47.24 --> 02:06:49.24
on how to be courageous

1768
02:06:49.56 --> 02:06:52.12
But the first recommendation that it gave

1769
02:06:53.40 --> 02:06:58.04
Was place duty over your personal feelings or desires

1770
02:07:00.28 --> 02:07:03.64
Place duty over your own personal feelings or desires

1771
02:07:03.64 --> 02:07:09.96
And that's it and I think we can bring that down to a personal daily level

1772
02:07:11.88 --> 02:07:18.04
Duty means do what you're supposed to do. That's how we build courage

1773
02:07:19.48 --> 02:07:21.48
By ignoring how you feel

1774
02:07:21.56 --> 02:07:26.04
And ignoring what you desire and by doing what you are supposed to do

1775
02:07:27.32 --> 02:07:29.32
Which means we need

1776
02:07:29.48 --> 02:07:31.48
to get out there

1777
02:07:31.48 --> 02:07:33.32
and get after it

1778
02:07:33.32 --> 02:07:36.44
And until next time this is dave and echo and jaco

1779
02:07:36.44 --> 02:08:04.44
Out
