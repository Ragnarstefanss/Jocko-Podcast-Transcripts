[00:00:00] This is Jockelpontcast number 294 with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:09] Flight, this is Blue Star 6, RP, major bunting analysis across the release point on the ground indicating
[00:00:16] two minutes flight time to the landing zone. Without announcement, Charlie gunships from
[00:00:21] Crossbows began a slow dive toward the landing zone prepared to release some of the 14,
[00:00:27] 2.75 inch rockets that each aircraft carried along with their machine guns if it became necessary.
[00:00:35] Flight, lead is taking fire. Blue Star 6 announced over the UHF frequency, which was obvious
[00:00:41] to everyone behind him as the green tracers were coming from all around him.
[00:00:47] Choc2 is taking fire, we're hit, came the next announcement. Suddenly the radio was alive with every
[00:00:53] aircraft reporting taking fire as they crossed the RP and the woods around the landing zone
[00:00:59] were highlighted by red and white flashes and green tracers streaming upward.
[00:01:04] As each aircraft flew into the cone of fire attempting to reach the landing zone and discharge
[00:01:09] their load, the air waves became garbled as pilots stepped on each other's transmission
[00:01:14] or in panic, depress their transmit switch to the entire flight. So they could everyone could hear
[00:01:21] the conversation between a pilot and his crew. Choc6 is taking shit, get on your guns,
[00:01:26] Choc5, where's the damn guns? Break, break, choc10 is. There was so much confusion that no one could
[00:01:33] get a complete sentence transmitted until. Mayday, mayday, Dutch master 4-1 is going down.
[00:01:41] Said captain Fox and almost a calm voice. Who the hell is Dutch master 4-1? Someone asked
[00:01:47] over the radio, looking skyward and searching, everyone had their answer. Dutch master 4-1 was
[00:01:53] the command and control aircraft for the cab screen and was entering an auto rotation from 4,000 feet.
[00:02:01] What really held everyone's attention was the flames coming out of the bottom of the aircraft.
[00:02:06] Oh shit, it was obvious that he'd taken a hit with an explosive round in the fuel cell, but at 4,000 feet,
[00:02:13] every aircraft had at least one set of eyes tracking this crippled aircraft. An aircraft
[00:02:20] in flight on fire was somehow something few had ever seen before and it was horrifying and mesmerizing.
[00:02:30] Mayday, Dutch master 4-1 is on fire. Was the next call from captain Fox, his voice a bit elevated.
[00:02:36] Fire was every aviators' worst nightmare. Shoot me, but don't let me burn.
[00:02:44] It was a fear that had been with aviators since Orville and Wilbur had first flown.
[00:02:51] Before parachutes, World War I pilots were known to use their pistols rather than burn in an aircraft.
[00:02:58] As everyone watched, the radio is went silent. Slowly, Dutch master 4-1 began a slow roll.
[00:03:05] And as it hit the trees, it was inverted. The cab screen began to converge on the crash site.
[00:03:14] As major bunting entered the coltron of enemy fire, he turned to Mr. Grossman.
[00:03:20] Get on the controls with me in case I'm hit. Grossman immediately did so that with a very light touch,
[00:03:26] ready to take command of the aircraft. Suddenly, sour and Thomas opened fire.
[00:03:31] Taking fire, they both screamed together. Though there was no need since the sound of a hammer tapping
[00:03:37] on the side of the aircraft could clearly be heard. As blue star 6 continued to press toward the landing zone,
[00:03:43] decelerating and coming to a hover.
[00:03:47] The Arvins soldiers didn't wait for the aircraft to land. They started jumping out as the aircraft
[00:03:52] came to a slow walk. Before a major bunting could land, the aircraft was empty.
[00:03:57] Sir, go, go, where empty, sour yelled as he continued to fire as weapon at the tree line.
[00:04:04] Talk one on the go, major bunting transmitted, LZ is hot. His next transmission followed almost immediately.
[00:04:12] Made a made a, blue star 6 is going in. He had just cleared the landing zone
[00:04:18] when the aircraft engine quit. And that right there is an excerpt from book three from a series
[00:04:32] of books called Undontered Valor, which were written by Colonel Matt Jackson. And this is the third
[00:04:38] book of the series, which is subtitled Lamson 719. And the first book that he wrote in this series
[00:04:48] was subtitled and a salt helicopter squadron of Vietnam 1969 to 1970. And we had the honor of
[00:04:54] covering that book with Colonel Jackson on this podcast. It was podcast number 275. And that first
[00:05:02] book is based on Colonel Jackson's experiences himself as in Vietnam as a Huey pilot. The Huey,
[00:05:12] the iconic helicopter of the Vietnam War. And that first book, it's written as a novel or a story
[00:05:23] with the main character. The main character is named Dan Corrie, but that character is based on Colonel
[00:05:28] Jackson and the events that are in the book took place. And this third book is written in a similar
[00:05:34] way. It's written from the perspective or focused on an individual named Dan Corrie. But the
[00:05:43] events that are written about in this third book, they took place. And it continues to recount some
[00:05:51] of these incredible heroics from these helicopter pilots and helicopter crews in Vietnam. And this
[00:05:59] third book in the series tells the story of a massive operation, which included the largest
[00:06:07] helicopter assault of the Vietnam War. This is an operation that lasted 45 days. He was conducted
[00:06:12] in Louss. And it was an attempt to shut down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. And this book, Undonged
[00:06:19] Valor, Lamson, 719, is filled with incredible details that Colonel Jackson got by interviewing
[00:06:29] and doing intense research to accurately describe what happened. And the books, incredible read,
[00:06:37] but we're actually not going to read the book much today. We're going to touch on it a little bit
[00:06:42] because we have the honor of having one of the pilots who also flew Huey's in Vietnam and who flew
[00:06:53] missions in support of Operation Lamson 719. His name is J. T. He's a retired major, US Army.
[00:07:04] He is the recipient of two distinguished flying crosses, 38 air metals, recognizing
[00:07:10] 950 hours of combat flying, the Bronze Star, the Vietnamese Cross of Galantry, and the Silver Star
[00:07:20] for his heroic actions under fire. He's an honor to have him here with us tonight.
[00:07:28] J. Thank you for joining us. Well, well that introduction was put me right back on the cockpit.
[00:07:35] And that book is filled with those either coming into landing zones or coming out of landing zones.
[00:07:44] It's just incredible to read and incredible to learn about the history of that operation.
[00:07:51] As a matter of fact, I was talking to a friend of mine that was in that was in in Sagan, Vietnam.
[00:07:56] And I mentioned that you were coming on the podcast and I told him that you flew in Lamson 719.
[00:08:03] And the look on his faces, that was a rough one. You know, we supported
[00:08:10] Commander-Cotrone North, which was the northern segment of SOG and Vietnam.
[00:08:17] And I remember several missions that we flew prior to the kickoff of Lamson 719 on
[00:08:26] the 8 February prior to that. We were flying out of the Quantry Dong Ha area with a group of
[00:08:33] Commander-Cotrone North Gossum up there flying west towards K-Son when all of a sudden
[00:08:42] on our flood of four, we saw these orange fireballs coming up at us. And we immediately took
[00:08:51] a invasive action 23 millimeter an aircraft fire coming up at us. We took action to get out of there.
[00:09:01] Obviously, the mission at that moment was called off and we made it back to Dong Ha.
[00:09:07] One of the guys over torqued his aircraft in the invasive action.
[00:09:13] And it had to be grounded for inspection and for tail rotor to make sure that nothing had happened
[00:09:20] that would cause him further damage or even crashing. But that was in January of 71 before
[00:09:28] the kickoff of 8 February 71.
[00:09:32] Well, before we get into that, let's talk a little bit about the beginning of J. T.
[00:09:38] Where did you grow up? Where did you come from?
[00:09:41] A group in a little town called Hickory North Carolina. I was born in Pensacola. My father was
[00:09:47] flying chief in the Navy, flew PBYs. He was in charge of a hangar at Pensacola that repaired
[00:09:54] the scan on PBYs that were shot up. And Dad would take him up and fly up. Because the idiot
[00:10:01] circle around the airfield and land it and check to make sure the rivets were holding a
[00:10:07] K on the aircraft. So he was an enlisted chief in the Navy? Yep. That's pretty good.
[00:10:12] He had a background in aviation, or not in aviation metal smith, but it was a metal smith himself
[00:10:20] and did a lot of work with sheep metal and stuff like that. So obviously it was a skill that the
[00:10:26] Navy needed and Dad was a real smart guy and picked up on it and loved flying and got his wings.
[00:10:34] I remember his wings were had a goal center with the silver wings, which was different than the
[00:10:40] Air-regler, aviation, or as all several wings of the Navy. Or goal wings of the Navy. Yeah. So he was
[00:10:47] kind of a disappointed at and going the Navy, but when I went into Army aviation, that's sort of
[00:10:53] smoothed it over for him. How long did he do in the Navy? He was just a guy that went in in
[00:10:58] in 1942 after Pearl Harbor and got out in 45 and served the rest of his time in the reserves.
[00:11:07] Got out of the reserves right after the Korean War. Was he his own business man? He was going to
[00:11:13] say what was he for a living? Yeah, he was a full-time firefighter for the city of Hickory North
[00:11:19] Carolina and he also owned his own business. He had a shell service station. It was called
[00:11:23] Tate-Shale Service Station and I remember he had Tate-Shale and it was in great big letters,
[00:11:32] limited letters on top of the service station and the S letter burned out and had Tate-Hale
[00:11:39] up there. So dad would do a few commercials and on the radio and he said,
[00:11:47] business has been really good. We have sold the S out of Hell. It's so what about mom?
[00:11:56] See what was he doing? Mom was a typical housewife. Brought me up the stay at home.
[00:12:06] A group in her neighborhood where nobody locked her doors. We could go with vacation for two weeks.
[00:12:10] Doors to stay open. Remember one time we had a fire in our home burned up all it was in the
[00:12:19] clause that burned up all the others closed and they had no way of getting in touch with us because
[00:12:26] we didn't have sales service back then. But I remember all the ladies on a neighborhood came down
[00:12:30] and had the house completely cleaned up when we arrived home except for the fact that mother's
[00:12:35] closed were all burned up. But she got the insurance and got to buy home your wardrobe.
[00:12:41] That's not a bad deal. That's a kind of neighborhood. That grew up and nice.
[00:12:44] What about you? What were you interested in? What were you doing when you were a kid?
[00:12:48] Okay. It's quite ironic. In our neighborhood we had a field that was vacant and we called it
[00:12:59] the battlefield. And you have to understand this was in the early 50s and all of our parents had
[00:13:06] served in some form of military service. We had some Marines. We had Navy. We had Army.
[00:13:13] Then we had a Air Force. But we did have Navy pilot that was there. So we would all put on the
[00:13:21] gear that our fathers brought home and would play Army up in our battlefield. And from we would
[00:13:30] dig foxholes and we would make our own hand grenades but we couldn't pronounce hand grenades
[00:13:36] so we called him hand grenades. And the hand grenade was we would dig up red clay and North
[00:13:45] Kiela's watch it and would put water on it and fasten the balls and let it sit out in the sun.
[00:13:52] And then we would throw those at the enemy. In our marijuana time Eric Schufra got a black eye
[00:13:58] and his mother was not real happy that we were playing battlefield and throwing hand grenades.
[00:14:03] And then what about as you got older? As I got older I really wanted to go to a military school.
[00:14:12] And my parents were not quite, I was an older kid so my parents were not quite ready to
[00:14:18] let me go. I got into the scouts, got to wear the uniform. Say that was very important to me
[00:14:25] then wearing the uniform wearing it correctly. In high school I got into the band. I was a drummer.
[00:14:34] But the uniforms were all shaped like the tailored after the West Point uniforms with the
[00:14:42] high collars and to me that was just added to the the desired who want to do something in uniform.
[00:14:52] Then want to be a firefighter my father was but then cared to be a firefighter my uncle
[00:14:57] was a police officer didn't care about being a police officer. But there was something about the military
[00:15:02] that that was like a magnet to me. I would watch every as a child, I would watch every movie,
[00:15:10] a military movie on TV that would come on. Randolph Scott you know played those being he man
[00:15:17] Marine you know kind of like you know except you were in the Navy. But those things I gravitated
[00:15:25] toward that my good friend Don Murphy who I grew up with he did the same thing he went to the Marine
[00:15:32] Corps and it was really he went to the NCO route obviously officer out so at the times when we
[00:15:40] would be on leave and come home at the same time I had to go through this whole rigourment of
[00:15:45] about being an officer and and then listen man really knew what was going on and we were just there
[00:15:50] for showmanship. So what year did you graduate from high school? I graduated in 63
[00:16:00] quite interestingly I had tried out for the United States of America high school band
[00:16:07] as a drummer and was offered a trip so we this is these are two to four students from every state
[00:16:15] in the Indian and we met at University of Southern Mississippi to practice and then we toured
[00:16:21] all down through the south across over in the Mexico doing concert tours all the way to Hollywood
[00:16:29] we did a we did a big concert in the Hollywood Bowl and I mean have a bit of a saying you know
[00:16:36] and again in those outstanding uniforms that were similar to the ones that I wore at
[00:16:41] Banyon uniforms at a war in high school and so it just added to the and I was proud of that
[00:16:49] I was very proud to wear that uniform and I wore it right and I spit shined my shoes I did that
[00:16:54] all away from junior high school and I was in the band all away through high school so I
[00:16:58] knew how to spit shined but then I was offered a full scholarship to University of Southern Mississippi
[00:17:06] and also to University of West Virginia I didn't like West Virginia because it's everything was
[00:17:14] heels it seemed like everywhere you went you had to go up a hill and I know you navy guys you
[00:17:19] liked that stuff but you know I was quite into that so I took the scholarship to Southern Mississippi
[00:17:25] there ROTC was mandatory for freshmen and sophomores and so there again here I was in uniform
[00:17:32] not only and I was at the scholarship I was in University of Southern Mississippi was a full full
[00:17:38] rod music scholarship and I was a drummer in the University of Southern Mississippi band
[00:17:45] after my first year I decided I didn't want to be a music major so I thought well you know
[00:17:51] I think I'll go into art design because I like to be creative in this so I transferred out of Southern
[00:17:58] Mississippi to my father's just made because it was all paid for and I enrolled in East Tennessee State
[00:18:05] University in Johnson City Tennessee and there again sophomore year I was in my sophomore year
[00:18:14] ROTC mandatory but the more I got into it the the more I just really gravitated towards that
[00:18:20] and I took my oath of office as an advanced core cadet as a junior and from there on it's just
[00:18:32] I cared more about getting that commission than I did about getting my degree I had transferred majors
[00:18:40] from music to art design so and that time we were all in the quarter system so I had to go
[00:18:46] in extra quarter to take up all the courses that I needed to take and I graduated December
[00:18:52] at 67 first went down the island capping gown and then after I got my diploma then all of the
[00:19:01] cadets go out take off the capping gown and we put on our uniform coats where I had the pants and
[00:19:08] stuff on for that so under the gowns so I came down and we were all commissioned in an
[00:19:14] I remember my mom and dad pinnacles gold bars on my shoulder and boy I tell you what I
[00:19:18] yeah I felt like I had really accomplished at least the first phase of my life so that was
[00:19:24] 1967. Night December of 67 I went on active duty in March of 68 as an infantry officer
[00:19:35] brand new what we call butter bar wearing the gold bars the second lieutenant I went to
[00:19:43] the infantry schools called the infantry officers basic course at Fort Benning just on the other
[00:19:50] side of the hill for most for all the OCS guys they called OCS the Benning School for Boys
[00:19:58] and I'll never forget we were so here we were commissioned officers and there they were
[00:20:04] hoping to be commissioned officers and many times we would march by their their area and I
[00:20:11] recall a big telephone pole and on top of the telephone pole in the officer candidate school
[00:20:17] area was this black helmet shiny black helmet with a gold bar in the center of the helmet
[00:20:26] it was actually a helmet liner and what they would try to OCS guys the house competition who could
[00:20:35] get up there and get the helmet first course the pole was always greased and I don't know if anybody
[00:20:41] ever got up there got that helmet without putting cleats on their shoes but at any rate but yeah that's
[00:20:50] that was my first taste at Benning of being a real army officer. So this is 1967 so you must have
[00:20:57] pretty much known as an infantry officer you were gonna end up going to Vietnam. Oh yeah I was
[00:21:01] I was ready I was prepared I was mentally prepared while at East Tennessee State I was
[00:21:10] a member of the Sigma Phi Upsilon fraternity practically every one of the advanced
[00:21:16] corkidats juniors and seniors were advanced corps army ROTC cadets and everyone this
[00:21:25] my fraternity was a big military fraternity and we we took great pride in that and
[00:21:33] I remember we would inspect each other and the fraternity asked before we would leave to go to
[00:21:37] drill on Thursdays just to make sure everybody was dressed right dressed ready for it and
[00:21:43] and it was it was an it was an honor to be an advanced corkidat and you had all of these
[00:21:51] underclassmen that this was that you were leading this was our first time is really being a leader
[00:21:57] giving commands moving orders for a platoon and company drill and and and this kind of stuff and so
[00:22:07] they were instilling on us they being the cadre was instilling us the correct way of
[00:22:15] of of being an officer of showing authority without disrespecting people and you can correct
[00:22:24] people without disrespecting people and and I learned that through ROTC and that's kind of
[00:22:33] kind of interesting because I know that ROTC cadets coming up being commissioned
[00:22:39] then have the greatest reputation amongst a lot of the NCOs in the army at that time
[00:22:43] so when it's 1967 and you mentioned that everyone freshman and sophomore had to be in ROTC
[00:22:52] it was mandatory at at University of Southern Mississippi and it was mandatory at East Tennessee State
[00:22:57] University I can't speak for the other colleges and universities but I would think that
[00:23:03] perhaps that was the manner in which every university at least of us federally funded university
[00:23:10] had to operate wow that's pretty so what about what about like as far as kind of the social
[00:23:19] aspects of America at the time where you started in 1967 you were you really seeing much of that
[00:23:25] anti-war attitude or anything like that no not we were not subjected to that I don't recall that
[00:23:33] I recall that on campus there was no snickering when in uniform every Thursday was drill day
[00:23:43] and so everyone had to show up for drill day had to be in proper uniform
[00:23:51] if you were a sophomore or a freshman or sophomore you were carrying the M1 Grand Raffle
[00:23:57] and every week as a freshman sophomore you had to go to the arms room and clean your weapon
[00:24:02] and I had to be and you see you were taking ROTC for credit so for the two years of
[00:24:09] Jefferson sophomore you were taking ROTC for credit so yeah you best clean your weapon because
[00:24:14] if you did and you get a demerit and X number of demerits means you got a dropping grade so
[00:24:20] we would actually go through and do inspection before
[00:24:24] every drill mate which was on Thursdays and that's how I learned how to inspect an M1 Go-Anne
[00:24:32] Rife and I don't know if you ever fired one of those but I think I actually have fired one
[00:24:40] I think I actually have I fired a bunch of different weapons you know we do like these familiarization
[00:24:45] shoots and they brought a lot of bunch of old weapons and new weapons and I can't but I'm pretty sure
[00:24:50] I have fired one but they used to have this when you would clean your raffle when you pull the bolt back
[00:24:59] and you would have to clean down through the board and everything and then what you would do is you would
[00:25:04] take the little quite cloth that you used to stick on the on the board rod to clean the
[00:25:12] clean the board out but you'd stick it down there and you'd look through and the light from
[00:25:16] that would shine up through and you could tell whether or not you had any any materials in the board
[00:25:20] it shouldn't be there and but then you had to you had to pull back on the charging in yes
[00:25:33] and then let it go right quick so it would go forward what if you didn't let it go right quick
[00:25:38] you would get what's called ill one thumb because it would get stuck right and many times I had him one thumb on that yeah
[00:25:49] so so you go to the infantry course the wood you call the basic infantry course
[00:25:54] after off-sourced basic course I OBC so when when you're in that I mean you must be these guys are
[00:26:01] preparing you to go be a platoon leader and be around correct correct yeah 1542 platoon leader and
[00:26:08] and this is now is it 1968 1968 now so there's a lot of experience guys that are teaching you a lot
[00:26:15] a lot how long was that course of instruction non weeks if I think correctly was it non weeks or 16 weeks
[00:26:23] I think it was might have been 12 weeks I'd have to think about that because I took my first command
[00:26:34] at brag I was there in in March not took my first command at brag and in round August so when you're
[00:26:46] going through that course or you get forming up platoons and you're going out and doing training
[00:26:49] this is that kind of thing yeah that's exactly right forming in platoon and companies and then they
[00:26:55] rotated who was going to put the platoon leader maybe we're all second-lead tenants well not all of us
[00:27:01] we had some direct commission guys in there I had a sergeant major who was direct commission to a captain
[00:27:06] and special forces guy and snake eater and he he was always the company commander
[00:27:16] and great guy wonderful guy but we was switch rolls around we participated in all different
[00:27:24] consummenevers whether it be an armored column with infantry or whether it be squad tactics
[00:27:35] whether it be platoon tactics or where that was in a company crossing over what then they called the
[00:27:43] line of departure the L.D. we don't have that in warfare and every there is no L.D. it's a
[00:27:52] blocked perimeter defense and we're going to that but we practiced all of that not everybody went
[00:27:58] airborne but we all did the the almost a 47 foot tower that dropped you out and so you get a
[00:28:06] feel for what falling with a shoot on his like and but we were on a night combat compass course
[00:28:15] in an ever four office we were not teams of four pouring down rain in four menning Georgia
[00:28:24] Columbia Columbus George and it was in the early spring and it was cold as hell and we were sitting
[00:28:35] or chattering and it was a night combat compass course we were dropped off at a point on a road
[00:28:42] in a doos on a half and all right team alpha out so we would get out and we knew where we were
[00:28:50] had a postmark with a number on it and we had our maps so we knew where we were and then we had
[00:28:57] our directions okay you're you're you're a 4A you got to be a point bay and you had to shoot your
[00:29:03] asthma looking at your maps see what shoot your asthma with that and then go to point bay and then
[00:29:09] you go to point bay to point c but pouring down rain cold tea chattering only one guy in our four
[00:29:17] smoke so we would have him light a cigarette and put it in his mouth and he would go out following
[00:29:26] the asthma and till we were telling the stop and light it so that we could make correct okay go
[00:29:32] two feet to your right two feet to your left so that he was directly on asthma and then he would stand
[00:29:38] there with his cigarette lit so we can puffing on it so we could see the light and then we would go to
[00:29:43] him then we'd shoot the next asthma with the exact same way send him out and guess what we made it
[00:29:50] we made it we were one of the first teams to make it through that night combat compass course
[00:29:56] of course along the way there were little surprises like an explosion would happen over maybe
[00:30:05] 20 meters to our right so we'd have to go down well it was all planned as to where this stuff was
[00:30:11] going and we didn't realize it but in our there were season troops out there taking care of us they
[00:30:17] weren't going to let us get hurt we didn't know that at the time but but during that night compass
[00:30:26] course pouring down rain I heard in the background what what what what what what what what
[00:30:35] it got louder and louder and louder and louder and louder and it finally what what what
[00:30:39] about the straight over our heads to Huey aircraft and I said to myself those guys are dry
[00:30:49] they have it better than I do a couple days later in our company area they had a
[00:30:56] sauna anyone interested in army aviation we're going to be given the flight after two
[00:31:00] tests on a certain date I was the first in order to run the sauna for that thing
[00:31:05] and then that was it you got picked up for it graduated from a bending took my first command
[00:31:12] at Fort Bragg I was in interesting here I am an infantry officer and my command was a military
[00:31:18] and was with a military intelligence battalion M. Avita in here I am an infantry officer
[00:31:23] I'll never forget my first sergeant first sergeant Chuck Holly I don't think anybody ever
[00:31:29] forgets the name of their first first sergeant not officers and he brought me in he treated me
[00:31:36] I was kind of embarrassed because he had all these metals and here I am brand new
[00:31:40] second lieutenant no combat experience and he treated me like with great respect and
[00:31:50] welcome me aboard I mean I never forget the first time I walked in that early room he calls
[00:31:55] you all your room to attention I'll sort of baffled you know here I have secondly tenets you looking
[00:31:59] over your shoulder for a criminal yeah what in the world is going but yeah and I learned a lot from
[00:32:07] I started Holly my first first sergeant never forget going out on just a maneuver and here I am
[00:32:17] we have our military intelligence and my bars military intelligence battalion air reconnaissance
[00:32:24] my actual unit and I was command of Alfa the test but we had our law of mission we would take
[00:32:30] photographs that were uh talking about the air force sent back to Fort Bragg for a photographs
[00:32:36] over Vietnam sent back to Fort Bragg and my guys and Alfa the testman and there was
[00:32:42] bravada testman Charlie the testman but the missions given our guys we were actually
[00:32:47] taking uh the photographs and pulling intelligence out of the photographs using
[00:32:53] stereoscopes which you can measure the height of various objects from so on so forth
[00:32:58] then we would put all that together and we would get in a bird dog at Fort Bragg and
[00:33:07] fly that to DC and that and it was a real live mission I mean how many people can say that
[00:33:14] you know they were we were actually doing a real live mission in support of Vietnam at that time
[00:33:20] here I was a little secondly tenant you know barely drive behind the ears and my first sergeant
[00:33:26] kept me straight how did a bunch of warm officers worked for me too and they really did all the work
[00:33:31] I was there just to sign my name and and thank my first sergeant for keeping me straight
[00:33:37] how long did you do that job for? Four months, the orders came down sending me to
[00:33:42] flight school at Fort Walter's Texas so you showed the flight school when we were talking
[00:33:48] when I was talking to Colonel Jackson it sounded crazy the number of helicopter pilots that
[00:33:54] would be in train at that time it was amazing totally amazing you see Matt Jackson started off as
[00:34:01] warm officer so he had a whole different experience than I did that was for warm officer
[00:34:09] Candace school we called them walks and people said well what's a walk and we'd say well
[00:34:15] that's something you throw out a web it I think it's funny because it would he's talking
[00:34:21] about you guys the commission officers they called them RLO's real life officers
[00:34:28] so we had the real life officers and the walks yeah the real live officers
[00:34:34] yeah and and we were all each class had a designated color and the my class at the
[00:34:42] be the yellow hat class and you tell different classes about the color of baseball cap that you wore
[00:34:48] and you had these funny wings that you sewed on the on the front of your hat they weren't
[00:34:55] aviator wings but like student aviator wings and so we had the yellow hat so the walk class going
[00:35:03] through they were yellow hat class but we never never got together and that was the primary flight
[00:35:10] training and that's where we just learned to fly my first helicopter that I climbed into was a
[00:35:17] training helicopter 55 it's a huge 300 aircraft but it was small I mean you could probably get the
[00:35:25] whole aircraft into this room would have to probably knock out part of your walls so the
[00:35:30] tail road would get through but that's how small it was I mean it was smaller than the OH13 and most
[00:35:36] people remember that by when they watched mash or the H23 which was back in that era as well
[00:35:45] but that's what I learned to fly on it was so tiny and being tiny wasn't easy to fly it was very
[00:35:51] squirrely so I remember people I said might I wish I was in that 13 or that 23 and they said
[00:35:58] well you know you're getting some great pilot skills in in that TH55 because you're learning how
[00:36:04] to adjust for a wind it's so and so forth and they said when you get to when you get to a
[00:36:08] rucker that Huey is going to be like you're climbing out a little fiat into a Rolls Royce
[00:36:16] and I remember our first cross country after we had solo I so load at my 14th hour you had to
[00:36:24] solo within 16 hours or you got sent back to another class so I also load at my 14th hour and that's
[00:36:32] amazing getting you know the instructor pilot gets on says okay you've got the aircraft and
[00:36:40] you fly the idiot circle and you call take off you call turning into the wind you call based
[00:36:48] and you call final you had to do all the correct call signs and everything and we were at little
[00:36:52] staging areas all around Fort Walters Texas which was in mineral wells Texas so we probably had
[00:37:00] staging areas as much as 50 miles out because you had all these classes and all these very staging
[00:37:05] areas and I'll never forget it was a little anxious when he climbed out of that cockpit and I knew
[00:37:14] that I was in control and but then after you flew your first solo coming back in the bus didn't
[00:37:24] stop it Fort Walters at the at the fort it stopped at the holiday end tradition is everyone
[00:37:34] who's so load the bus would stop there and those are how to solo get stayed on the bus those
[00:37:40] who had already solo got off the bus with the new solo guys and they carried you and threw you
[00:37:46] in the pool at the holiday end and interestingly at the holiday end in in in at mineral wells
[00:37:55] they had crossed Huey rotor blades that you walked under to go to the swimming pool and to have
[00:38:03] that honor of being thrown in the pool was just incredibly amazing and fulfilling.
[00:38:11] Did you have any did you have any trouble when you're going through aviation school
[00:38:14] did it come pretty naturally to you were you you know did did did you did you figured out pretty
[00:38:19] quicker when you said 14 hours was that well no I mean we have some guys that that solo
[00:38:26] at 10 hours I mean they were I mean just incredible but you have to understand a lot of the
[00:38:32] guys I went through with or I had their private ticket most of those fixed wing I don't know
[00:38:37] of anyone in my class that had a rotary wing private ticket and had they done that they could
[00:38:43] have probably sold load in five hours you know it just all depends but leaving there
[00:38:50] here's the other interesting thing all the polish we're getting this flight pay plus we're getting
[00:38:55] our normal cyclotinip pay which I think was like 247 dollars a month how much was flight pay
[00:39:02] oh flat pay was god i i i i i know when i quit getting flat pay it the end it was like 400
[00:39:07] something dollars a month but so that's kind of crazy right like you're almost doubling your pay oh yeah
[00:39:12] oh yeah and but but interesting about it is you got all these single guys here so what are we
[00:39:16] do we get to the to the car dealer so everybody I remember a good buddy of mine was my roommate
[00:39:25] he and i actually lived in a motel right up side the gate of Fort Walters and he had a
[00:39:32] Camero Z-28 whatever it was Z-carb V28 I had the Osmo Bill 442 and I mean that just goes on all the
[00:39:45] hot cars you know the single polish you know we thought our Sierra didn't stay we had that stuff you know
[00:39:52] we you know we were just there there was something about that it just started the camaraderie
[00:40:02] just started building and I remember when we left Fort Walters to go to Fort Rucorale
[00:40:08] Alabama for our advanced training over for office that convoyed all the way to and we we made
[00:40:18] our first pit stop in Montgomery Alabama but we convoyed all the way down through there and we all
[00:40:24] had CBs in our cars so you know it was like we were flying and we were talking yesterday
[00:40:29] other and and and on the back of the car we everybody had uninestates army aviation
[00:40:37] and a little sticker in your back of your window you know and you know like I say we thought our
[00:40:42] Sierra didn't just think and we got to we got to Montgomery we all checked in that night
[00:40:49] and I got a call from the desk it said I've got you listed as owning a 1968 Osmo Bill 442
[00:41:02] it's black vinyl top with blue bottom I said yeah yeah that's that's mine
[00:41:09] you said sorry you need to come to the desk like go the desk and there's a truck driver there
[00:41:14] he had pulled his 18 wheeler into the parking lot of the motels where the four of us were all staying
[00:41:22] didn't cut sharp enough and hit the left rear quarter panel of my car and toward all the pieces
[00:41:33] I mean Schneider trucking I'll never forget you see there trucks on the road all the time
[00:41:38] and I'll forget to snuck oh and he was so apologetic and so on and called his
[00:41:44] dispatcher and everything was fine but anyhow we had a couple days before he had to report into
[00:41:54] Fort Rucker so my plan was I was going to drive the car up the North Carolina
[00:42:00] given to my dad they get it fixed up he'd give me his car I drive it down to to Rucker
[00:42:05] well we get up the next morning and I get a call from my roommate to the BIMA roommate
[00:42:10] in the primary training and he said hey goomba his name is John Vagniti hey goomba
[00:42:21] okay now the joke said what are you talking about John where's my car
[00:42:27] that's the that John I don't have your car oh come on come somebody had stolen his car that night
[00:42:34] now my car gets hit somebody still is John's car that night my government police does all the
[00:42:41] investigation and so the next so after that was done I said okay throw your Garamark car we're
[00:42:47] driving at North Carolina so we drove to North Carolina picked up my dad's car in the meantime John
[00:42:55] calls his dad who owned a company called Superior plastics and in water I'll think of
[00:43:04] a minute but in New Jersey and any John has a new car waiting for him just like that from that but
[00:43:12] yeah that was that was the beginning of our our advanced course in flying helicopters for the
[00:43:20] United States Army so when you get to Rucker for Rucker is that when you start flying the Huey
[00:43:24] yeah yep it was and it was like everybody said the Huey came natural to me it was just I mean it was
[00:43:32] amazing to crank that thing up and and then to hold the cycle again pull up on that collective
[00:43:43] and I mean it was just it's like everybody said it's like going from a fiance onto a Rolls
[00:43:47] Royce and it was so easy I mean it was you know even though had a law crosswind it wasn't shifting
[00:43:54] like the TH fit 5 in the TH fit 5 would shift if you had a 3 night crosswind so
[00:44:00] but it was an incredible incredible aircraft and of course while we were flying that we were also
[00:44:09] getting our instrument training down there it's the first time we'd been on instruments so the
[00:44:13] instrument training was not in the Huey it was in an OH13 and that's where we were under the hood and
[00:44:22] and flying on instruments and and got what we called a tac ticket tactical ticket it wasn't the
[00:44:30] regular standard instrument ticket that the woman normally get it was a tac ticket and what was
[00:44:36] interesting about that and this will come up later in our conversation is I learned how to shoot
[00:44:42] ground control approaches very well GCA approaches very well we'll talk about that later on in our
[00:44:48] conversation is that where you learned originally to shoot it that's where I learned to shoot it yep
[00:44:54] and it came in very handy and then so how much longer was it until you how long was that
[00:45:00] training um that training we got there and so that had to have been about I must have been about
[00:45:08] three three or so months because I think in July yeah it was in July that that I got my
[00:45:15] silver wings pinned on me and my mom and dad drove down it was a wonderful experience my
[00:45:23] girlfriend at the time came down with my parents and I was so proud of those wings I mean
[00:45:28] I was so proud of being a butter bar in December 67 and so proud of getting those wings
[00:45:38] later on that would have been in 69 because you know 68 I took over the command and went to
[00:45:46] flight school went through Christmas graduated in July 69 very proud of that I remember every weekend
[00:45:53] of while we were at Fort Rucker a bunch of us would go to Panama City Florida and there was a
[00:46:00] young couple and there are two children on a motel there so we went down to go shaded with them that
[00:46:07] we would like to come down every weekend and stay in the same suite of rooms and and they knew
[00:46:15] that we were everybody in flight school wasn't orders to go to Vietnam right out of flight school
[00:46:19] and they were certainly aware of that and so they took us up on our offer that we would arrive
[00:46:25] on front and night and leave on Sunday and she had a closet in the suite and she said you just
[00:46:33] keep all your beach closures everything down here I'll wash them I'll clean them up for you
[00:46:37] and I'll hang them back up in the suite and she did that every night every front and night we got
[00:46:42] down there she and her family had dinner prepared for the four of us and we all ate together as a family now
[00:46:49] that's that's people who cared and I took my parents there and right after we drove down to
[00:47:00] Panama City after I got the silver wings and we stayed in that hotel that night and with them and
[00:47:07] we all congregated the family that owned it we all congregated together and then I left out the
[00:47:14] the next day my parents stayed down all for a while but the next day was the landing on the move
[00:47:22] and we washed it after my girlfriend I washed that we got back into Hickory from driving from
[00:47:29] Panama City Florida and I wanted the things that when I first covered um
[00:47:34] Colonel Jackson's first book you know one of the statistics that he brings up in the book is
[00:47:41] there was 5000 Huey sent to Vietnam in 3200 of him were lost in combat
[00:47:47] did your parents know these kind of statistics were they nervous as hell were they talking to you
[00:47:53] about you know what was going to happen how did you feel about it um my parents
[00:48:00] I never expressed any worry whatsoever about being in fact I wanted to go to NAMM
[00:48:09] right after flight school there were too many infantry officers serving infantry aviators in Vietnam
[00:48:15] there were not enough slots for all the infantry aviators there were infantry aviators who were like
[00:48:21] I'm third in line to be a battoon leader as a captain so what happened was all the infantry officers
[00:48:31] and my flight class at a rucker there were orders for change from Vietnam to state side of
[00:48:36] Samus so I went to Fort Bragg and flew with Alpha Company 82nd Aviation Battalion
[00:48:43] there I flew with seasoned aviators who had come back from Vietnam I was the battoon next
[00:48:49] home up a tunnel leader was captain Fred Dickens who had flown with the little bears the
[00:48:54] 25th infantry division he had flown over in a Cambodia during adding courage and a lot of
[00:48:59] that's written Cambodia is written up in Matt's first book there but I learned a lot from Fred I
[00:49:05] learned a lot from the other a lot of the war officers that were there who just uh Jim Foster for
[00:49:15] example he had flown with the 48th blue stars and learned a lot about him because we did a lot
[00:49:24] of tactical maneuvers with the 82nd during that time and he sort of gave me a feel for what I
[00:49:30] would be doing when I got to Vietnam Jim ended up being a roommate with myself and Fred Dickens
[00:49:38] captain Dickens. Jim and I stayed friends until this day he was going to get out of the army and I
[00:49:44] talked him into staying in the army and encouraged him to extend his enlistment as a war officer
[00:49:50] which he did and finally retired out of the army I hope sometime Jim can hear this podcast and
[00:49:57] can smile a little bit about that. What's very interesting is that after I put him my orders to go
[00:50:05] to Vietnam again requested none orders came down sending me to the seventh after division in Korea.
[00:50:14] Commanding the seventh after division was a god by the name of how more who was
[00:50:19] lieutenant Colonel how more in the I-Drain Valley with the first calf and we all know about
[00:50:25] we were soldiers once and young general more at that time was two star general and uh I was the
[00:50:31] seventh aviation battalion maintenance officer and when in general more was a rated aviation had to
[00:50:37] fly four months or four hours every month to maintain proficiency you draw a flight pay I don't know if
[00:50:43] you tell a general officer you can't draw a flight pay but it ain't right my job was to fly copal it
[00:50:48] with him and I got to know him and so this is this in Korea this is in Korea now so I've put
[00:50:55] in orders I put in requests to go to Vietnam towards come down send me to Korea okay so I was not that
[00:51:04] much aware of general more I didn't know about the I-Drain Valley back then I mean this was in 71
[00:51:11] I didn't know much about the I-Drain Valley not 71 I'm sorry this was in uh 70 when I got to
[00:51:18] Korea from Brag and so he asked me one day while we were flying how I liked my summit with the
[00:51:27] seventh and I told him it was fine but I said if I don't get to Vietnam sir I can kiss my career
[00:51:32] good bye because I mean you know I want to be a career army officer and if I don't have Vietnam
[00:51:37] time and have performed well and I'll never be a career army officer and he talked a little bit
[00:51:44] he said would have a particular unit you want to go to and I said yes or I'd like to go to the
[00:51:48] 25th effort division fly with the aviation attorney and he says any particular company I said
[00:51:55] Alpha Company sir they're known as a little bear she said I know the little bears I've heard
[00:51:59] the little bears are great in it um oh that was on Saturday oh Monday I got to call from the
[00:52:06] general's aide and it said general wants to make sure you're ready to get an arm I said yes I am
[00:52:12] okay you want to go to Alpha Company 25th aviation battalion oh the general wanted to know if
[00:52:18] you want to take any leave in the States I mean he can only authorize 20 days but I said what should
[00:52:25] I find get there within three or four days orders came down not been in Korea now
[00:52:33] maybe four or five months by that time orders came down and on usually orders and it probably
[00:52:41] is the same thing in the Navy you have you have regulations that authorize system such
[00:52:46] there were no regulations authorizing anything on my orders it was all Voco which means voice command
[00:52:54] VOCO between commander-sector division commander 25th infantry division Voco and it went all the way
[00:53:02] down to even commander-a-arleeft out of Oakland and my leave my 20 days leave started and so anyhow
[00:53:12] I go to Kimpo Airport I get on airplane okay I fly home my 20 days didn't start until I reached my home
[00:53:18] of record and the 20 days was up the day that I left my home of record so I'm not on leave until I reach
[00:53:26] my point left there after 20 days flew to Oakland then Oakland to nom I get to nom and this is
[00:53:38] in the fall of 70 I get to nom we're all getting off the airplane you know everybody here is
[00:53:45] about the humidity how it just sucks the air out of you when you get off the airplane landing
[00:53:51] and you get tons of new so get off the airplane okay there's a think of Lieutenant Colonel
[00:53:58] out there at a bunch of inlisted men and they say okay all the officers over to my right okay
[00:54:05] and then it started to make it okay all the NCOs in front of me and there's another E7
[00:54:09] that says okay all the list of men down here in this side so well get over there okay they're
[00:54:14] calling out names so the Colonel is a Colonel major is calling out all the officers names says
[00:54:21] there any name they have an air-based regional handset and they might have a call down I said here
[00:54:25] I mean you must be captain T I said what yes or I am he said well your truck will be here in 20 minutes
[00:54:32] and a trucker flew in from the 25th from Alpha Company 25th aviation battalion to pick me up
[00:54:39] oh yeah macro so pick me up take me to Koo Chi where the 25th air course yeah we get out of
[00:54:47] G must admit a hell of an infra-good impression 10 more on my good name a cheap pick some
[00:54:53] me up dross me to the orderly room and I yeah I go in and sleep to the company come on
[00:54:59] who's a major major's command accompanies and and and the major said I don't know who they are
[00:55:08] but welcome aboard check my check my hand and that was my introduction to the Alpha Company 25th
[00:55:19] aviation that's amazing you know you you made a joke about how to know if you can
[00:55:27] if you need to take the flight pay away from a general officer but apparently those general officers
[00:55:34] had some power that's incredible general how more and I've read the book I've watched the movie
[00:55:41] quite a few times even general more before he passed away thought that male Gibson did a good job
[00:55:48] but representing him and in the sergeant major but you know that was he was a hell of a man
[00:55:56] a great leader he was he was not one of these general officers that said himself up on a
[00:56:03] plateau he was down with his troops and and and I saw that quality in him and I was in great
[00:56:12] admiration for that so you show up so you show up what's the first thing that happens when
[00:56:21] you show up and Vietnam now they what they they must have thought you were the best pilot or something
[00:56:25] that's how you were somebody the company exo company commander says exo get captain Tate
[00:56:34] place to stay the echo exo said well sir where would you like to stay and I said well my buddy
[00:56:42] Fred Dickens captain Dickens he he stayed in a hooch called a holiday in he said is that still
[00:56:48] or any so yes or a holiday answer out of here he said let me say oh yeah there's the bunk available
[00:56:53] so I stayed in the same hoots that captain Dickens stayed in and after I got everything squared away
[00:57:02] the exo said now there're going to be cocktails up here at captain so-and-so's place and
[00:57:08] he showed me where there was he said he said so come on up and meet the guys
[00:57:13] with this captain was great at fixing martinis so heck yeah I went up there and had a martini they
[00:57:21] had some order herbs out there and I thought wow this is it so this is really crazy so I was with them
[00:57:29] I'm right at two months into the first of November and orders came down for the 25th to draw
[00:57:41] down and prepared a head back to Hawaii and I thought to myself man this is really great I've been
[00:57:48] here too much now I'm going Hawaii and I'd already been laying out on top of a bunker in a lounge
[00:57:54] chair I had a nice sun tan and of course my dermatologist doesn't think it's a nice sun tan today but
[00:58:02] at any rate I thought wow this is going to be awesome I get Hawaii you know all are having
[00:58:08] a tan everything look good well no everyone who had less than six months in country got reassigned
[00:58:16] so I found my younger era on a C1 30 several about a week or so later headed to a core there was
[00:58:26] no everything was pacified in three core where the 25th was I never flew into one hot LZ
[00:58:33] in fact I never flew into an LZ in three core that had all been pacified so I mean I had I never even
[00:58:41] heard the door gunners work out with the 25th because there was there was no enemy threat we
[00:58:48] thought at least at a time it wasn't apparent get on the C1 30 flami up to food by food by international
[00:58:58] I core very close to the north south of it in these border get off the aircraft
[00:59:07] got my parachute pack and bag with me full of my stuff pouring down rain and
[00:59:18] they'll load us into building and say we're going to go to screaming equals
[00:59:23] orientation training and we did that for about a week and then it got reassigned to my regular unit
[00:59:32] now interested I was with alpha company 82nd aviation battalion when I got to the seventh
[00:59:41] I was actually assigned as a staff maintenance officer but I was located in alpha company
[00:59:47] seventh aviation battalion 25th I go to alpha company 25th where I get a sign with 101st aviation
[00:59:54] battalion alpha company 101st aviation battalion known as the comment chair of light
[00:59:59] that was the week after I had become a 101st air assault trooper
[01:00:10] then how long was it before you started flying missions with them took my checkeride the next day
[01:00:16] I was a Peter Pollett the following day when it had a hot LZ first time I'd ever heard
[01:00:22] the M60 machine gun door gunner and crew chief working out the ship literally danced when they
[01:00:29] pull that trigger you could fill the shake going in and going out hot LZ I heard ding ding
[01:00:38] three things on the aircraft came back and I I experienced what they call you got your cherry
[01:00:44] busted with took three rounds in the aircraft going out LZ came back that night
[01:00:51] once you got your cherry busted in the unit a lot of spread of core I mean the spread of
[01:00:57] core like you would what you would cause you've experienced that jockey but but I hadn't
[01:01:03] experienced anything like that and so what do we did yeah to get initiated before you could
[01:01:09] wear the unit patch and we had to drink the strength called a flame and hooker
[01:01:12] sounds tasty it was southern comfort and you take a matching a light so you got the blue flames coming
[01:01:28] up and that goes laughing here like he knows and had to drink it down all the way down
[01:01:39] set the glass down while the blue flame is still burning inside of it down turn it upside down
[01:01:45] and if more than two flaming drops came out of that glass you had to drink another until you
[01:01:52] got it down now keep in mind I was an RLO a real live officer all of the war officers
[01:02:01] they had a spread of core like you you've heard the war officer protective association
[01:02:06] wapa they took care of each other well they all most of them had mustaches what he could
[01:02:13] imagine drinking that flame hooker and you've got a mustache and that blue flame is coming up
[01:02:18] and there there were quite a few times that the the mustache has had to be put out and
[01:02:24] of course the bartender was there with a glass water he could throw over in our little
[01:02:30] washers club I was I was on a little assignment overseas and and we were in a bar and they had
[01:02:37] like a executive happy hour from you know four till six so we'd show up there at 359
[01:02:46] and it was free drink it was free drinks for two hours and I had like half a platoon with me
[01:02:53] so we're in there and this one I was a young and listed guy I was crazy and so we drink for the
[01:02:58] two hours and then we get done and now obviously everyone's primed but I remember telling the bartender
[01:03:05] we actually yeah we we we had run up quite the tab and I looked at the bartender I said we don't
[01:03:10] want to drink anything else unless it's a fire so every drink we're sparing light and everything
[01:03:16] off I was told you told me you know we all got a we all couldn't wait to a new guy came
[01:03:25] to the outfit and and that was in the oak club then listing guys got knows what was going on
[01:03:31] for the mistake but but we couldn't wait to you guy came in you know one of the things
[01:03:38] that Colonel Jackson talked about and wrote about was you know some of the flying that you
[01:03:42] doing when you're when you're formation flying and how it's so much closer than it was back
[01:03:48] in the states and then the the whole thing with the hover holes and getting down in there
[01:03:53] and having to listen to your crews like a hundred percent you can't see actually what they're
[01:03:57] telling you just have to trust them did you will you up to speed on that stuff or did you have
[01:04:01] to just get the steep learning curve learn formation flying a foot rucker four four
[01:04:06] rucker one olive foot rucker I was confident I could fly that airplane I knew I could fly that thing
[01:04:13] and and we right where the Jesus nut is on on a hilly with which which holds the main
[01:04:21] rotor and there's like a red rubber gasket so what you would do is you would for the helicopter
[01:04:28] let's say we're flying an echelon left all the helicopters from the leader going to the left
[01:04:34] to fly formation and that you would come up and you would have you would put the red rubber
[01:04:42] grommet rod on rod about just below the windshield just at the lower end of it so that would keep
[01:04:49] your height above it so you wouldn't get caught up in a rotor wash from the helicopter but you
[01:04:54] would keep it up and then a staggered echelon left you've got the lead but every other helicopter
[01:05:01] is a little bit harder than the ones in in front of them and we flew a lot of formation flying
[01:05:07] at rucker so I felt very comfortable with that and then I was very fortunate to go to the
[01:05:13] 82nd after after flight school instead of going straight to non because I became even more
[01:05:21] proficient that and more proficient in in formation flying but there's one thing you learn
[01:05:30] in formation flying and non as you don't want to get too damn close because one round could take
[01:05:38] out too especially if it's 23 mic mic or 37 and you don't want to be flying through debris
[01:05:50] so you did and we'll get talking about lambson 719 we did 22nd separations in that
[01:05:59] how long were you then with 101st before lambson went down okay
[01:06:05] so I got the 101st got into my unit a week before Thanksgiving of 70
[01:06:17] quick side story my cousin Charlie Finger was with the five of first signal battalion
[01:06:23] listed guy owned his second tour volunteered for his second tour
[01:06:27] I got a hold of Charlie brought him over to our unit took on the officers club
[01:06:34] we had Thanksgiving dinner together and I think about that you're with your family
[01:06:38] having Thanksgiving dinner together November 1970 and it was just a wonderful day to see Charlie
[01:06:48] I never saw Charlie after that he derosed went home I said I told him I said
[01:06:55] Charlie I'll come over when not grab in you can be my guest at the artillery battalion
[01:07:05] they're because they always had the good shows the USO shows and the Korean shows with all the
[01:07:10] all-girl Korean bands I'll come over and get you one night he's and he said sir
[01:07:14] I said Charlie I'm your cousin he said sir wouldn't be safe for you as an officer to be around our barracks at night
[01:07:26] and you know frigging was a thing over there and it was so I took him to that and all right so
[01:07:35] make a long story short I'm flying combat missions I flew my first commandic
[01:07:41] control SOG missions probably by in December because they just didn't let anybody fly
[01:07:49] the commandic control north missions you had a chance to have three R&Rs or you have two R&Rs
[01:07:57] if one of your R&Rs you want to go back to the states so I'll let to go back to the states
[01:08:02] a week after a week after Christmas and went back spent a wonderful time with my family
[01:08:11] New Year's Eve there with Fred Dickens by the time his wife Moe CEO for a kept friend
[01:08:20] and I left about a week after after that to fly back to Vietnam
[01:08:26] got into Tonsonoot and tried to get a what to fly up racer said I need to get up to
[01:08:38] Fuba and the guy said sir there's there's a major major operation a big thing going on
[01:08:42] he said I don't know when I can get you out of here I said I got to get out here quick if there's
[01:08:46] a major thing going I said he said we'll serve just stick around here and along behold within an hour
[01:08:51] they had a say say 123 flying that's 130 and one there's a big difference between those two
[01:09:01] R&Rs but you'd rather fly on a 130 anyhow say 120 there's only two engines
[01:09:06] so when you were flying those when you food sog missions I mean I look at the profile those
[01:09:12] sog missions that those guys were doing and it just it's it seems just completely crazy
[01:09:18] were you thinking that were you thinking okay here's whatever two Americans and four
[01:09:23] Vietnamese soldiers and gonna drop them off in the middle of Cambodia or Louson and we'll see what
[01:09:28] happens did that seem crazy to you you know it didn't it right off and I'll tell you what man
[01:09:37] we would fly down to a denying we flew out of three low with sock denying was the major base
[01:09:44] that was our headquarters there was one at food buy and there was one at country don't ha
[01:09:48] great the ones we flew out of denying were crazy I mean it was I mean that's like they got the
[01:09:56] music going everything and and it would flight follow with Kuvvi therefore fixed wing it would
[01:10:03] be up above us and and vector us and to where we're supposed to go I don't know how much of this
[01:10:11] I can I guess it's pretty declassified by now yeah well I mean it's pretty declassified it's been
[01:10:16] 20 years was the okay so here's a mission we go in a we fly team man yeah we put them in an
[01:10:26] area where Kuvvi has either told us or shot white white phosphorus down and landed and then
[01:10:33] we we spiraling go down into the landing zone spiraling go into the landing zone we drop them off
[01:10:40] then if they get into contact then we got to go back in there and pull them out which
[01:10:47] that did happen quite a few times a lot of times it didn't happen it didn't happen at all
[01:10:52] there were times we went in and they were in contact we had to pull them out with ropes
[01:10:56] McGuire rigs 120 foot ropes stretch 10 feet 130 foot they had to strap them on we had to pull
[01:11:02] them out of the had the jungle sometimes it was ladders that we would drop down and they'd
[01:11:07] climb up on the ladders and get out what and that was extractions whenever did we had
[01:11:17] we did some insertions with ropes too because they were going on on the side of a mountain
[01:11:21] there were no way with foliage and there was no way we could land so we would we would put
[01:11:28] it down but I remember times that I pulled the guys out on ladders and never to be there were three
[01:11:34] guys on my ladders now you gotta think about that the density out to you didn't what that
[01:11:39] does to lift the helicopter so we got them out and got them back in to Vietnam
[01:11:46] that's when you said oh my god we're back in Vietnam you know that's when you that's when you
[01:11:50] start to realize it and we came in and we had to land in a like a rice paddy so these
[01:11:56] guys could get off the ladders and get back in our our choppers and you just didn't and any
[01:12:03] moment you just felt like this is it I'm gonna I'm a bite and a couple of our guys did and
[01:12:13] combinatorial north missions and died and a lot of the saw guys went with them so that's you
[01:12:22] know that's the bad part of all 14 guys the year I was in but here's one mission we flew in we we
[01:12:31] were gonna insert a team landed in the LZ big elephant grass probably eight feet high
[01:12:39] runner wash lays the grass down and when it did the whole LZ was ring with the V8 and our door
[01:12:46] gonna start to working out and firing everybody's firing and everybody's in surrogate tell
[01:12:49] I get to hell out here and we were firing firing we were taking rounds two but nobody nobody
[01:12:54] nobody aboard our aircraft was injured I mean that's just one thing we would do personal raids
[01:13:02] Intel would tell us where there was a big NBA battalion headquarters we had we had all the
[01:13:10] all the intel on it we knew the comings and goings had been watching the Washington watch
[01:13:16] and we've afli out flot of four the the third aircraft was always had the medical on the
[01:13:23] fourth aircraft was the aircraft that would pull your ass out if you guys shot down first two
[01:13:29] aircraft would go in I happened to be on the second aircraft on one of these personal raids where we
[01:13:36] went in a land at right in the down middle of a battalion in the abatai and headquarters the
[01:13:41] Gazon board jump out I bet you we weren't on the ground 20 seconds and they're coming back in they've
[01:13:47] got captives they've got all sorts of documents in our hand we get back on that ship and
[01:13:53] were our asses out of there going to the nine I mean that's the and it was exciting I mean I'm
[01:14:01] not gonna tell you the anxiety one there but I was scared that was exciting and it would come
[01:14:10] back in the half coal bears I mean that's so cheap yeah another day at sag so I guess you did
[01:14:19] think those missions were a little bit crazy but but it was fun crazy you know we were young we didn't
[01:14:26] know any better I guess to fly on today I probably couldn't see the damn instruments
[01:14:36] so you're flying you fly in a bunch of those missions and now you're I mean sounds like you're
[01:14:41] racking up some pretty good hours and some pretty good experience at doing it and and then so
[01:14:47] so lamson when did you so you got back from your your Christmas and New Year's leave so that's
[01:14:52] January whatever yes it's a lip part of January you come back and now it's um it's you get told immediately
[01:14:59] hey there's some kind of big operation we don't really know what it does but you got to get up there
[01:15:04] no they just said there's a big operation going on an awkward and and they and I said I got to get
[01:15:10] up there I told them I'm a ton commander up there I've got to get up there yeah my guys maybe up there
[01:15:17] this up so anyhow I get up there it's very well that it's kept quiet so when I got into my unit
[01:15:28] and said what the hell's going on people kind of looked at me like what are you talking about and
[01:15:33] I told them all about that and my company commander knew about it major cool Bob Kloel he's in the
[01:15:39] book you know Bob knew about it but anyway that's why I told you that prior and this was in January
[01:15:47] we take a a sock mission out of uh CC a mission out of a Dong Ha and we're flying towards
[01:15:56] Leo Shumboar crossing in the vicinity a case on when those red balls of orange balls of far
[01:16:05] start coming up at us and we have to take a base of action or get shot down by 23 Mike Mike
[01:16:11] or 37 up no so we knew and and see as far as as far as I'm concerned that was reconnaissance
[01:16:21] M prep four and that wasn't just one reconnaissance that was just one of many reconnaissance
[01:16:27] M prep four Lamson 719 so the the premise of Lamson 719 and again the the book
[01:16:33] undunited values it's volume three Lamson the subtitles Lamson 719 the premise of the
[01:16:40] operation is that America wanted to go into louse and shut down the Ho Chi Mintrell they also
[01:16:50] America didn't want to put any troops any American troops on the ground inside allows
[01:16:57] because they didn't like the way that looked politically so they decided well we'll run the
[01:17:02] operation using South Vietnamese soldiers but in order to actually execute the operation they were
[01:17:10] going to need to have American aviation because America was the only one really capable of
[01:17:16] doing that job of air lifting all these South Vietnamese soldiers in the louse and then on top of
[01:17:22] that if you're going to use the helicopters then we're going to use the air support to in the
[01:17:25] air assets so that that's sort of the premise of the operation and it's a big operation to go like
[01:17:32] I said the goal is to kind of put it put a halt on on the the portion of Ho Chi Mintrell that ran
[01:17:38] through louse and and and and and and and and and the head waters of that was in the town of
[01:17:44] Simone so that was the final objective was to capture Simone it's failed to TCEP O and it's got a weird
[01:17:56] spell yeah it's got a weird spell yeah that that was the goal and that was kind of that
[01:18:01] Simone was the furthest away the fur the deepest in the louse that we get to there would be
[01:18:06] correct the furthest north of the Ho Chi Mintrell called it the head waters of the Ho Chi Mintrell
[01:18:12] I would say there's also and and reading about it there was also the underlying goal was
[01:18:21] to sort of prove that the South Vietnamese military could conduct these operations that they were
[01:18:27] capable that they were capable of doing these kind of things that was part of Nixon's
[01:18:32] victimization policy the more that the South Vietnamese could prove that they could
[01:18:38] take care of themselves and defend their homeland than the less there was need of US forces
[01:18:45] especially ground forces so you're saying that you're your company commander kind of new about it
[01:18:53] when you showed up there I have to think he did because major clothing did not seem
[01:18:59] a really surprised in fact if I recall and I hope I'm not making this up but if I recall he seems to
[01:19:08] prize that I made it up in a quick autonomous I did from from Saigon now prior to the actual
[01:19:16] execution of Lamson 719 there was another operation that was to push up to to the case on combat base
[01:19:26] there off of route 9 it's called duicane into that now did you participate in duicane into
[01:19:32] you know I have to think I did but I'm not it's kind of hard to
[01:19:39] because I flew so much I mean I flew over 1200 hours and I'm 950 of which were actual combat missions
[01:19:47] so I have to think that I did I never recall flying any what the call convoy support
[01:19:56] a lot of that would have been done by Charlie Marl and in Cobra gunships to take action
[01:20:05] no doubt in my mind that I fly supporting operations for duicane into
[01:20:12] but I never quite tagged it as as duicane into
[01:20:20] hell I had so much going on anyhow I've tried to keep my one armorses enlisted man
[01:20:25] and ten helicopters fly but the point of operation duicane into was to push up into
[01:20:32] case on which and get control of it and then that was going to then be used as a logistics hub
[01:20:39] and an air hub to conduct this big operation um Lamson 719 that's what the purpose was
[01:20:46] but in addition to that too was to put the south of it in these army in a position
[01:20:53] to where they could readily launch across the border so pre-staging all these folks all these soldiers
[01:21:02] out there and get them ready the the the area that you were going into
[01:21:11] had some serious enemy troops in there you know the you know some of the estimates I read
[01:21:16] 7,000 combat troops on the ground in that area of Lousy 10,000 support personnel
[01:21:25] another another 5,000 path of Lousy fighters so it was this was you were going into tough
[01:21:32] country 33,000 total is the estimate that's pretty much kicked around
[01:21:38] of all of all the categories you you just described so when did you win did you actually find out
[01:21:45] that that this mission was going down we got the briefing on at the mission actually
[01:21:52] started on 8 February of 71 by that time hunter first command post was in operation at case on
[01:22:06] general berry was up there Matt Jackson features a lot of berry in the book
[01:22:12] and I have some stories about that that I'll share with you later on
[01:22:19] off-loose several missions in support of that taking troops into
[01:22:28] hill 30 hill 31 range of arv and ranges were in 31
[01:22:32] we flew so we have pick-up zones pz if you will at various stage of wetland and then
[01:22:44] take them to the to the LZ around there but that was just in prep 4 and really
[01:22:55] the big action for me the thing that I guess made me realize that my god there's a real war going
[01:23:09] on was in LZ Lollo which is on the third of March yeah I'll tell you one thing that's interesting
[01:23:16] when you read this book and when you hear about this this operation you know most of the time
[01:23:24] when you think of oh what the what the Vietnamese are doing it's sort of like what the North Vietnamese
[01:23:28] doing what the Vietnamese are doing it's sort of like a hit and run it doesn't seem like these big
[01:23:33] conventional operations and if they did do a big assault on a base you know they kind of do it
[01:23:38] they they'd mess some things up and then they'd leave they were doing big coordinated attacks
[01:23:46] against the south Vietnamese forces it this was almost like bordering in fact this was like conventional
[01:23:52] warfare correct and but you didn't see that rod on eight fabulous that came later on
[01:24:02] and it was devastating to to witness some of what I witnessed after the third of March what I
[01:24:13] witnessed on the ground with the south of it and the me's army especially when we would go into
[01:24:20] a resupply around hill 30 and hill 31 I saw some heroism but I saw so many are the arvin army of the
[01:24:34] south of it me's army saw so many of the soldiers throw the weapons on the ground and run to
[01:24:39] grab onto our skids so that when we lifted off we'd pull them out of the battle space that was
[01:24:46] disheartening it was horrible yeah I remember reading one part where it's exactly what you said
[01:24:52] a resupply comes in and the the helicopters as they leave they're overloaded with arvin soldiers that
[01:25:01] are just trying to get out of there throw the weapons on the ground and run and grab onto a skid
[01:25:06] I mean I witnessed soldiers losing their grip and falling 1500 2000 feet to the ground below
[01:25:17] and and if sank to you feel sorry for them or do you say you coward you got what's coming to you
[01:25:26] and you know it got to the point Jocca where we would I remember landing it in
[01:25:33] and I can't remember I think it was 31 that I landed in but we were landing where motors were
[01:25:42] blowing up right in front of us and we would have to maneuver over eminent and motors were flying
[01:25:47] we're hitting everywhere in the LSE and we would literally come to about a 10 foot hover kick off the
[01:25:55] supplies can't come into the law because they would jump on your ship and even at a 10 foot hover
[01:26:00] they would run jump on people's back and they would hoof them up onto the skid I mean a 10 foot hover
[01:26:08] and and you start to wonder well when's it gonna be my day you know and I remember having this
[01:26:17] thing to can't see my mind is you know I know I'm gonna die so I'm not gonna worry about dying
[01:26:25] I'm not gonna die just don't let me get shot up subab I mother can't
[01:26:31] recognize me but I knew I was I was gonna get it I just and then I didn't didn't bother me anymore
[01:26:39] it did not bother me anymore I about dying I accepted the fact that was gonna happen and you
[01:26:48] got to take care of me and a mother would recognize me I haven't that feel no and then see in the
[01:26:57] South Vietnamese just you're doing all you can to help them out risking your lives and they're
[01:27:04] just wanting to get out of there we picked up body bags of the South Vietnamese body bags for U.S.
[01:27:11] forces and you've seen them they're sturdy they're zippered the body bags for the South Vietnamese
[01:27:16] forces were like one hour martin ice and bags little thin plastic bags had bodies in them they had
[01:27:22] laid out in the sun for for several days they were all bloated in body fluids filling up inside the
[01:27:31] body bags and and that's the one time where we really put skids on the ground so they could load up
[01:27:38] bodies and of course the Vietnamese didn't run in jump on air crack cause they didn't want to run
[01:27:42] and jump on all those bodies that were bloated and it got to the point where we had to where we had
[01:27:50] to wear gas map one of us in the cockpit had a gas mask because of the smell was just nauseating
[01:27:57] and we would bring them back into case on or Elsie Brown wherever where a pickup zone was
[01:28:06] and the South Vietnamese troops had unloaded the bodies and I remember I remember one it just
[01:28:10] it just the guy grabbed the arm of a body and what he tried to pull the body out the whole arm
[01:28:16] came out of the out of the body it was just sickening it was beyond it was beyond anything that
[01:28:27] most humans would ever experience and you know you you you you go through that and you say well
[01:28:35] what's the purpose why are we why are we here why are we doing this I had a warm officer who I asked
[01:28:43] of during lamps on to ask I said I need more people to fly this mission he said I'm not going to
[01:28:49] fly the mission I said I need you I'm not going to fly I said why not he said because nobody cares
[01:28:55] Congress doesn't care whether I live or die and what's the use look what they're doing up there
[01:28:59] and I said well mister and I will say his name but you got to do what you got to do he had too many
[01:29:06] hours you know he had over 140 hours flying at months so he was he was way within his legal rights
[01:29:12] to sound like not flying anymore but guess what most always had that as well most always were flying
[01:29:19] I mean dead tired and we did it and but you know that's starting to be thinking who cares who really cares
[01:29:27] whether we do whether we do or not whether we die or whether we come over alive I mean look
[01:29:33] what the south fit needs to do in vitmization yeah tell me about it Richard next I won't
[01:29:38] you over here at lamps on seven one nine looking at this and then you tell me vitmization
[01:29:47] it made me a change person and we hadn't even talked about LZ Lola
[01:29:54] yeah I mean LZ Lola came a little into the operation I mean I just kind of want to run through
[01:30:02] a little bit of the timeline of so this this operation starts on February 8th but there's
[01:30:09] 4,000 arv and that are going in on on route 9 the 39th Ranger battalion is he load into LZ
[01:30:18] Ranger the first infantry divisions going into LZ blue and Don white and brown and FSB's hotel
[01:30:26] delta delta one and again the the book gives such good detail on all sides the planning what
[01:30:32] the how the decisions were being made it's just it's a fantastic recounting of what happened
[01:30:42] and meanwhile still Vietnam you still got bad weather you still got low clouds you got heavy
[01:30:46] anti aircraft fire the there's a lot of air strikes are happening so you know the B52s
[01:30:55] are dropping bombs arc lights yeah the but look there's a lot of a lot of NVA up there and they're
[01:31:05] they're ready to fight then they start actually attacking like I said like like by
[01:31:12] I don't know February 16th 17th the the NVA starts doing organized attacks and
[01:31:24] really bringing it to to the to the people to the to the south Vietnamese soldiers that are now on the ground
[01:31:31] um and here's the here's another thing that I was reading about by February 24th
[01:31:43] there were reports coming back that the that the North Vietnamese had completed a new route
[01:31:49] and they were just going around that area of the Ho Chi Minh Trail they were just you know okay
[01:31:54] well you guys want to block that cool we'll just we had another alternate route
[01:31:57] so February 25th just a massive North Vietnamese assault and it's combined arms they got armor
[01:32:07] they got artillery they got infantry assault they're doing combined arms assaults again this is
[01:32:13] not what we typically think of in Vietnam I know it happened from time to time but it's not what you
[01:32:18] generally think of in Vietnam you don't think of pitched conventional warfare like we're doing with here
[01:32:24] um there's just yeah yeah the the one quote I got was 94 there's a helicopter
[01:32:34] resupply to FSB 30 and 94 south Vietnamese soldiers forced their way onto the helicopters
[01:32:42] to get out of there including the commander that's on March 2nd by the way
[01:32:49] uh we get to March 3rd which which you've discussed a few times and and
[01:33:00] well actually let me jump into this small small portion of the book here that that talks about
[01:33:08] some of what you guys were doing I'm gonna go to the book here one officer Doug Walmack
[01:33:14] Wratler 28 and chalk 3 considered aborting his approach watching Arnie being shot down and hearing
[01:33:21] flight lead calling for mission abort not hearing anything else about aborting the mission he decided
[01:33:27] he needed to insert his load of arv and soldiers unbeknownst to him was the fact that no arv and
[01:33:33] had survived in the first two aircraft
[01:33:37] approaching the landing zone he was subjected to the same intense fire as the chalks perform
[01:33:42] upon landing an RPG rocker was fired but slammed into a stump and exploded
[01:33:46] showering the aircraft with shrapnel when it did time stood still for Mr. Walmack
[01:33:52] as it seemed he could count the main rotor passing in front of the aircraft
[01:33:56] several rounds ripped across the aircraft from three bursts of AK 47 fire
[01:34:01] the broder blades cabin lower fuselage and skids all received the damage
[01:34:06] as the aircraft lifted out of the landing zone hammer blows were felt by the pilot look
[01:34:13] and the pilot looked back not only were there holes in the floor of the cargo area but strange
[01:34:19] sounds told him that the main rotor might have taken some hits as well chalk 4 followed chalk
[01:34:25] 3 into the landing zone where it received intense small arms fire crashed and burned
[01:34:31] chalk 4 crew scrambled back to chalk 5 and rode out
[01:34:36] this kept up as each chalk came into the landing zone to drop off the arv and soldiers on board
[01:34:43] chalk 16 comment Kevin Chero
[01:34:47] 304 by Bob Morris entered the culture of fire and landed
[01:34:53] like everyone before him he could feel and hear the hits on his aircraft
[01:34:56] we're on fire someone said over the road radio but didn't identify themselves Morris pulled
[01:35:03] in power and initiated his takeoff very calmly he heard his crew chief say over the intercom
[01:35:09] Mr. Morris you do know we're on fire don't you Mr. Morris quickly returned to the landing zone
[01:35:15] and exited the aircraft chalk 18 approached the landing zone at 90 knots air speed instead of the usual
[01:35:21] 40 knots when so close he picked out his landing point just as a mortar round exploded at that spot
[01:35:28] suddenly his tail dropped low and the nose went high as captain Tate went into a hard
[01:35:33] deceleration with numerous hammer taps on the aircraft three feet from his touchdown point
[01:35:38] there was a loud explosion explosion a gaping hole appeared in the window frame and there was
[01:35:44] the smell of hot metal engine oil pressure was no longer steady but fluctuating
[01:35:50] arvon soldiers had no desire to wait for him to land and go out of the aircraft to safety
[01:35:54] of a prone position on the ground pulling in an armpit of collective Tate's aircraft
[01:36:00] tail number 049 raised out of the landing zone with the hail of small arms bullets
[01:36:05] chief chasing after him his aircraft had flown its last mission within an hour only 19 of the
[01:36:12] 40 year craft were able to enter the landing zone 19 out of 40 year craft were able to enter the landing zone
[01:36:32] Mars crashed in the landing zone came back in crash with another aircraft when in bird
[01:36:40] flumbaburke he crashed in the LZ they were on the ground one of the copolits kept in
[01:36:48] Jerry Cruz comment show been a second to him Vietnam first terror to his Ranger
[01:36:56] Jerry was on the ground with a prick 25 radio calling in air strikes and actually conducting the
[01:37:01] ground warfare in the LZ because the arvon officer major just Jerry knew what he was doing
[01:37:12] Jerry was the one that eventually said we got we got to halt this because there's too much crap
[01:37:17] going on in here and Kirk Latter obviously took it and we stopped the insertion for a while
[01:37:26] back and picked it back up again later on the afternoon that morning I we got hit by rocket
[01:37:34] propeller grenade as you've described the gaping hole in the windshield hit the windshield struck
[01:37:40] it was shot at about a 45 degree angle so when it hit the windshield exploded out instead of
[01:37:46] exploding in crout cheese said sir sir sir get ass out of here get ass out of here sir sir
[01:37:53] the nuts the inter panel which is our control warning lights look like a Christmas tree you
[01:37:57] look up and we took off it within within several seconds we started feeling harshness in the
[01:38:06] controls the hydraulic system warning light was blinking and within within another short amount of
[01:38:14] time we lost all hydraulics took both of us on the controls to select going down a highway at
[01:38:20] 85 miles narrow to Paris during goes out and you're coming up on some major curves it took us
[01:38:27] both on the controls we're finally able to get it back in called emergency case on
[01:38:36] we were like number two or three emergency at that time guys ahead of us who had
[01:38:42] gotten blown up on low low and we got it down we we had to make a low slow and we thought
[01:38:52] we're gonna get shot out of the sky just trying to get in the land at on the pierced steel
[01:38:57] plinking or under way at case on but my god it was a textbook landing and we were able to
[01:39:06] get her down and no sooner than we got it down a nasty aircraft to do some half of the chain pull
[01:39:13] pull the aircraft right off the wrong way getting ready for another another person calling emergency
[01:39:21] I remember Colonel Fernando Bobby Fennander he was our retired commander
[01:39:28] hunter first aviation battalion which was part of the hundred first aviation group
[01:39:31] commander about Colonel Davis you'll see Davis's name in that book Fennander is also mentioned in that
[01:39:36] book but for an honor comes out and sort of those his arms around us like God I'm so glad you
[01:39:42] got me it and he said come on there's another briefing going on in the tent so we all
[01:39:49] round over to the big briefing tent and your your aircraft was is it the correct word total
[01:39:55] yeah couldn't be flown again couldn't be flown again yeah now whether they hooked it out of there
[01:40:01] and got it repaired or what but it shot out hydraulics we had 47 holes on that aircraft that morning
[01:40:06] we counted the holes in the aircraft 47 holes and lost hydraulics and the any of you guys any
[01:40:14] of your guys get wounded in the aircraft not amazing isn't that amazing I mean just it just blows my mind
[01:40:23] but for an honor came out I thought it was interesting here's Lieutenant Colonel coming out
[01:40:29] and it's like welcome this home and all right we got to get in the briefing tent we got this thing
[01:40:34] and we had a briefing tent for the we were in the briefing tent Kirk Latter all were
[01:40:39] Kirk Latter's commander 223 aviation battalion and told us about the afternoon mission we
[01:40:47] got to get back in there we got more troops to insert and alone and and Colonel Fernando looked
[01:40:53] at me and he said I'm sure you want to go in there fly to your to your crews are on the ground
[01:40:57] and they're just so I don't know how to have an aircraft he said we take mine I said sorry said take
[01:41:03] mine but the only thing you got to take my crew chief with you and and then he put me aside he said
[01:41:09] now listen that's a brand new aircraft don't you bring that thing back to where you brought
[01:41:13] first back the sporting acid yes sir well you didn't know bay that order very well did you
[01:41:19] know because I fifty eight holes in his aircraft when we got back that afternoon we were able
[01:41:25] to rescue the guys off the ground so talk us through that so sir you launch again to go back into
[01:41:31] this is by the way this is LZ low low you call it Lulu low low low yeah it's not your
[01:41:35] defra- low uh low little Brigida they were all named after Liza's after Elizabeth Taylor
[01:41:42] what was the other one but I can't think of a name right now but they were all named after a Hollywood
[01:41:48] star that's but uh so you get the briefing of okay we got guys on the ground we got to go back in there
[01:41:57] and you just have forty seven holes in your aircraft when you saw a bunch of your friends get
[01:42:01] shot down you saw a bunch of other aircraft get shot down that are sitting in the LZ now you get
[01:42:05] brought in the briefing room hey you got to go again you said don't have an aircraft aircraft
[01:42:11] the boss says you can take mine bratt didn't even have twenty five hours on brand new here we
[01:42:18] and the only one cave out you got to take my crew chief okay so we get to start we get to say no okay
[01:42:28] let's crank them oh and by the way there was no unit integrity anymore I mean we were just all
[01:42:36] kind of all big you know like all of us who ever could be in a bird whoever could go and so
[01:42:44] we take off we have troops on board we take off we put put those troops on the ground
[01:42:54] and I'm hovering around for a few sex to make sure the our guys have gotten off they were picked
[01:42:58] up by commentaries in front of me but I wanted to make sure that we had our bioth ground
[01:43:02] and by that time where as you described the hammer taps on the screen never I mean it was just
[01:43:08] all over and and it's like I said earlier somebody was like I said take your bare hand and grab a
[01:43:15] wasp and that's what it was like and so again the same scenario taking all these heads thank god
[01:43:25] didn't get hit by an RPG but the nonsia panel listening all the circuit if a major system
[01:43:34] goes down or is damaged you have a little light that flashes on and on that light it says for
[01:43:38] example hydraulics so you know something's happened to your hydraulic system tell rotor
[01:43:43] knows something's happened to your teller so but the one that got me that started flashing was
[01:43:49] main rotor transmission what does that mean? transmission the transmission rotor yeah okay so it
[01:43:59] means what it says yeah yeah and we got her back on the ground we'll come to the hover
[01:44:08] we put it down at case on and the main rotor locked seized turned the chopper almost
[01:44:17] two hundred seventy degrees around from our landing head there were actually bailed tech reps
[01:44:24] up at case on looking at damage and what because they were riding their reports for
[01:44:32] hey this and this what we need to improve on on the newer models of the hui they were riding
[01:44:37] their reports they got told me he said sure you're very lucky he said you could have had
[01:44:42] that transmission could have seized in the air he said you guys wouldn't be here and it
[01:44:48] seized on the ground for an enter came over fifty holes that had wrapped and a locked seized
[01:45:00] through the misdeceased transmission that that that helicopter obviously didn't fly again that day that's two of them one day
[01:45:13] we uh I say we'd lost a lot of aircraft that day and it was getting night time
[01:45:21] um we had this guy that liked to fix this stuff called common trails stew and uh there were
[01:45:32] on case on there was actually wild onions jica pulled out of the ground and uh he had a bunch
[01:45:39] of guys collected that and they always kept this potton where it can't water in this potton
[01:45:45] throw those things they put a bunch of sea rashes in there and stir all that stuff up and you know
[01:45:50] anything takes go with Texas pedaling and so we were all here and all that stuff done and
[01:45:58] and we were by the source sit around I think he had some paper plates or something with him and
[01:46:04] you know you eat with your fingers and all that stuff and we were all kind of sort of
[01:46:08] together around there waiting for major claw to come over and tell us what our you know next missions were
[01:46:14] with lost uh we took 10 aircraft up that morning and uh we lost well we lost if if you count
[01:46:26] 11 aircraft Colonel Fannanders bird we lost seven um we did have one one gunner hit
[01:46:36] uh but you know purple heart loom but superficial but still he got hit you know that's bad stuff
[01:46:46] but um we're sitting there sort of gathering around and uh all of a sudden we see
[01:46:52] coming toward us figure just tall and laying and and just and I got the glint of the stars on his
[01:47:02] helmet and he got closer to us he just he was the epitome of spit shun boots and it was journal
[01:47:11] Sidbury and he came over and he said uh I just want to tell you comment you're just
[01:47:19] what a great job he did today and uh he said uh I don't want to disturb you child and we said
[01:47:28] well sir come on have some childish and know that at your child I grab something to eat up here but
[01:47:33] I just wanted you all to know what a great job he did today and uh with that he said uh girlfriend
[01:47:40] and I'm gonna release you all for the night so we all jumped on the forward-maning aircraft and
[01:47:47] came back to camp eagle there's a section in here in the in the book where um that gets described a
[01:47:56] little bit you're on this flight back to camp eagle and I'm going to the book here it says
[01:48:01] sitting mesmerized on the floor of one of the hewis was captain J. Tate, common chariot two six
[01:48:08] Tate the second flight platoon leader was deep in thought having lost two aircraft this day to end me fire
[01:48:16] the flight was at 6,000 feet flying over a uh flying over a cloud overcast with the sun projecting the
[01:48:23] aircraft shadow on the cloud below them in addition a halo appeared around the shadow he was
[01:48:29] sitting in the doorway behind the right seat pilot with the set of headphones that the crew
[01:48:34] chief had given him wondering to himself why he and his crew had survived this horrendous day
[01:48:40] he heard a voice say to him don't worry J you're gonna be okay he looked up to see who was talking to him
[01:48:48] no one was each passenger was lost in their own thoughts he heard the voice again don't worry J
[01:48:56] you're gonna be okay just then amazing grace played on the armed forces via the non-radio network
[01:49:05] and there's a footnote here that says one week later J received a letter from his mother
[01:49:11] she related a dream she'd have the night before in which J's father had told her don't worry J
[01:49:18] you are going to be okay the letter was dated four March
[01:49:23] J still has the letter touching yeah that's uh that's an amazing amazing story
[01:49:46] emotional uh I watched that shadow where we were actually flying between two layers of clouds
[01:50:00] the sun broke through the upper layer and cast the shadow and of course the heat of the chopper
[01:50:07] the coolness of that altitude for sort of a rainbow effect around that shadow and uh hit the the
[01:50:19] crew chief actually didn't lend me a set of earphones I had my flat helmet on and had it plugged in
[01:50:26] listening to AFVN and because I had been talking about he said there's a major action or major
[01:50:33] war going on up in hot core and he said he said there's been a lot of uh a lot of helicopters
[01:50:42] destroyed and so I want to play this next song for these guys it's one of the
[01:50:49] pretty amazing grace and uh I can tell you as I sit here right now I heard that voice and to get that letter
[01:51:07] and to hear my mom and to hear her read her words that she thought
[01:51:13] dad was telling her don't worry J is going to be okay and she walked my dad up and
[01:51:21] that said oh honey you're dreaming you go back to sleep she said no you said did you tell
[01:51:26] my J is going to be okay you said honey don't worry you don't tell him but there's not a god
[01:51:34] I mean if I pretended to be a Christian at one time but I'll tell you what
[01:51:38] that afternoon I became a Christian that's the only way I can say was from off and I
[01:51:48] thought to say those who died weren't because I had prayed God I know I'm going to die just
[01:51:54] don't let me get shot up so bad but my mother won't recognize me and uh I came home
[01:52:01] change person
[01:52:11] well my mother died the she had the same pastor she passed away in 2010 she had relayed that story
[01:52:22] about the dream to her pastor and he had made notes about that that was in his file
[01:52:28] and during her celebration of life service he talked about that
[01:52:39] when you got done when you guys flew back to Camp Eagle did you what did you stand
[01:52:48] down for tonight and then you went back into it
[01:52:50] I fought up skies we're monitoring everything on our company frequency and they had heard all the chaos
[01:53:01] and the horror that was being dealt to us and so of the 10 crew
[01:53:13] we all came back on those four ships because 11 ships if you count
[01:53:21] girlfriend and her ship
[01:53:27] they were all outside waiting for us to come in waiting their hats
[01:53:34] and we all landed and they all ran up and everybody was getting a hug and everybody was
[01:53:43] cold beer was on the on the flatline and and it was just a big celebration and especially because we
[01:53:52] brought help Morrison is crew of Bergen his crew Jerry crews we got them off of there
[01:53:59] and they were sitting on the floor to pull up down and listen to something
[01:54:09] that's the camaraderie and as I told Matt Jackson I said aviation crews are different
[01:54:18] rank is superfluous everybody is has a specific mission crew chief door gunner co-poly
[01:54:29] aircraft commander everybody has a specific mission but nobody can do that one mission by themselves
[01:54:37] it takes all of us working together as a team and I don't care if I'm a captain and you're a
[01:54:44] spec for crew chief I'm no better than you are and if it wasn't for you I can be flying as airplane
[01:54:53] same with the door gun that's a lesson you learn at it you learn a lot about team
[01:55:02] you learn about personal courage you learn about personal responsibility
[01:55:08] you learn a certain sense of tenacity you can't be lazy you you the dedication's got to be there
[01:55:26] and that's what I experienced with these guys and being not
[01:55:28] everyone of them there was no lacquered everyone of them even the guys in the maintenance
[01:55:39] hanger that didn't fly those missions with us and many of them would jump into fly
[01:55:44] mission just to get out there and do it but even to the clerk that wrote the awards
[01:55:52] there was such a sense of dedication and camaraderie that I have never experienced in my
[01:55:58] entire life since then never in my 20 years in uniform and the 13 years that I was fortunate
[01:56:10] to serve as a civilian with the with the office of the secretary defense nothing nothing will ever
[01:56:18] compare to what I experienced especially in the Lamson 719 even the Commander
[01:56:28] Control North missions though they were hairy though they had some twist in terms I would have
[01:56:35] never expected and and and what we lost to crew on Commander Control North missions that's horrible
[01:56:46] but nothing compares with Lamson 719 and I think that's that's where the
[01:56:54] what we now see as air salt that's where it was born it was born there we had to think on
[01:57:05] our feet we did things that were written down we had to think on our feet and I mean like coming
[01:57:12] to the ten foot hover versus putting your skids in the ground how do you learn that you learn it
[01:57:16] from experience just just things I guess they're being learned today and more as they teach our
[01:57:32] assault at Fort Campbell today but my god that was I went to reunion at Fort Campbell several years
[01:57:42] back and the guys are all flying black hoax now then they looked at us like we were a war
[01:57:52] or two pilots found between nine with the low tech all this and they were captivated by the
[01:58:00] stories that we could tell you know if it wasn't for GPS I couldn't drive my car from point
[01:58:12] to point B but up in the air I could shoot a vector and I could say pop smoke and identify the smoke
[01:58:18] and you exactly where I was going just things you learn probably one of the words I'm most
[01:58:26] proud of as an army combination metal and I got that from a tank commander we inserted his soldiers
[01:58:34] into the ashaw valley this was after after 719 and it had been a long day for them and
[01:58:46] it was starting to start starting to sit and I get a call from and I something six I
[01:58:52] and I asked the phone he says could you take a one more mission I said we yes our shirts
[01:59:00] sure we can and did call ops because they're expectants he said well I want to treat my troops to ice
[01:59:09] cream and they've got ice cream and Burmaite cans on our long pad back at Eagle I said not a
[01:59:18] problem sir and we flew an ice cream mission in there and he awarded his troops for their hard work
[01:59:28] and I got an article for that I bet you that ice cream tastes good yeah yeah and
[01:59:41] after that I went with landing in LZ many times I'd get out of the cockpit
[01:59:50] always wore spit shum boots I always dress right dressed ready front the whole time always
[01:59:55] wore spit shum boots but I'm later to my goal I was going to get out of that damn cockpit
[02:00:02] and I say okay Peter Polly you got it copilot and I'd help the troops unload supplies off the
[02:00:09] ship and I I want to thank they appreciate that here's a aviation captain getting out of the
[02:00:19] cockpit and he's doing sweatwork that's what I learned in Vietnam we had a of and just an
[02:00:31] unbelievable relationship with the hundred first in the battle of Ramadi the the first the 506 was
[02:00:36] there and I could never say enough good things about their leadership and the soldiers on the ground
[02:00:46] the fighting that they did it was just amazing amazing courage and one of my guys making on
[02:01:00] so we were was killed doing a mission supporting them and when we got home we were now and
[02:01:08] on their wall where they have the list of the soldiers that they lost in the battle of
[02:01:13] Ramadi they have my keys name up there with them I think we're fortunate Jacke we're fortunate
[02:01:28] that when you people like that and there will be people who will go to their graves
[02:01:34] that never experience that kind of heros and that kind of commitment that kind of courage
[02:01:42] that kind of teamwork the camaraderie will never ever experience it and I think you're an
[02:01:49] irv- fortunate that we've had that opportunity indeed wouldn't trade it for the world
[02:02:02] what going back to to to Lamson once you had that would did they give you a night of
[02:02:09] rest and then you started flying missions again I had two days down and then started flying
[02:02:17] again it was after that that during the race applause when I think the arv-in knew that
[02:02:27] the NVA had a hell a lot more confidence in her ability than the arv-in did
[02:02:34] it was after that during doing those race supply missions in there that that I actually experienced
[02:02:42] them abandoning the battle space I didn't experience that before Lamson 719
[02:02:51] always thought it was interesting when we would we're going to a PZ
[02:02:57] early morning put put the chopper down waiting for them to load up the arv-in the
[02:03:03] self it means load up but I'd see them sitting there and they had water in their still pots and they were
[02:03:10] brushing their teeth and it was like this is extremely important that I brushed my teeth and
[02:03:16] all I saw well that's kind of interesting that they're doing that personal hygiene
[02:03:23] and they're going pour the water out put their helmet liners back in put their helmets
[02:03:29] under going clamol board this aircraft and god knows what faces them when they hit the OZ
[02:03:34] but they made sure that their teeth were clean as this goes on like you said the tide started to turn
[02:03:46] and I think the goal became just to get to how'd you say chippony is that how they said
[02:03:55] chippony the goal is to get there they kind of got there like almost like playing tag touched it yeah
[02:04:04] we made it and then said let's get out of here and by the way there was hardly anything there about this
[02:04:11] then and then as the arv-in started to retreat then the NVA stepped up the attacks even more
[02:04:23] and it just slaughtered yeah and that's where I picked up the body bags with the dead arv and soldiers in him
[02:04:41] turns into a bit of a route as the as the arv-in are now leaving you know there's
[02:04:48] again I mean I'm just a couple days here March 21st the NVA the North Vietnamese attack
[02:04:59] their division attacks a second and third battians US Air support during the day included 788
[02:05:06] helo gunships or these 157 tag clear strikes and 11b 52 strikes fast forward another day
[02:05:15] March 23rd 756 helo gunships or these 238 tag clear strikes 11b 52 strikes
[02:05:28] this is as they're kind of getting back to the border into south Vietnam right
[02:05:35] March 25 finally 45 days after the start of the operation all the south Vietnamese forces are out of
[02:05:43] louss and well so to speak yeah yeah strikers yeah I guess the ones that they are accounting for
[02:05:52] our back April 6th the basic case on is under attack and it gets abandoned
[02:06:06] and to your point earlier on April 7th so that's April 6th the operation is over
[02:06:12] the case on is abandoned April 7th President Nixon declares tonight I can report that
[02:06:18] Vietnam's realization has succeeded and announces the further withdraw 100,000 more troops
[02:06:28] friendly losses during this operation 7 fixed wing planes 108 helocopters lost
[02:06:36] 618 helocopters damaged 20% beyond repair 32 artillery pieces captured and these are south
[02:06:44] Vietnamese artillery pieces south Vietnamese tank 71 of them south Vietnamese armored vehicles 163 of them 37
[02:06:53] half trucks 278 trucks destroyed south Vietnamese loss and I couldn't really come up with a great
[02:07:02] number on this but it's between 5,000 and 15,000 men killed wounded or missing depending on the
[02:07:09] source that you go to Americans 149 wounded 38 missing an action 215 killed an action
[02:07:30] you know that's the second time we left case on we left it in 68 after the Marines got over run
[02:07:48] and here we go again and you often hear combat soldiers say we fault hard we lost
[02:07:54] guys in our unit to take that hill and next we took it we left it now we have to go back and take it
[02:07:59] again there it is when so now this operations over I mean did did attitude start to change
[02:08:15] you're here in Nixon saying that Vietnamization is working and you see the you see the south
[02:08:20] Vietnamese fleeing the battlefield what was the what was the attitude of you all in my unit and
[02:08:28] that's all I can speak for the a spread of core never never ceased we were still flying
[02:08:39] command and control north supporting those guys and their mission grew even more critical
[02:08:50] because they were there judging okay now the lamb sombs over what what's the
[02:08:56] pavement the north fit in the knees army doing now where are they you know it was during that time
[02:09:05] shortly after I left they over ran quantry dung ha heavens certainly within their site camp
[02:09:13] heavens which was north of campy go the hunt and furt head quarters but I never saw any sense of
[02:09:27] behavior they said okay well seven seven one nine's over I guess the wars over I never saw that
[02:09:34] attitude our soldiers remain very professional soldiers that's amazing cause many
[02:09:43] on were just nineteen years old some bomber eighteen I had worn off sort of a twenty one
[02:09:51] I'm out with an old dude I was twenty five I never never once questioned our our ability
[02:10:06] as an aviation unit to do the job the mission that we were assigned to do even after even
[02:10:13] up until the day I left when I became the operations officer my last four months in country
[02:10:18] I got a chance to look at at the battle space in a different way because I would go to
[02:10:23] batayan and batayan ops and look at that then come back and put that into company ops and and
[02:10:30] work our portion of the mission our company's portion of the batayan mission and
[02:10:40] I'd bring the guys into the briefing room the guys are gonna be flying that mission
[02:10:45] and I'd say okay this is our objective right here now how do we get there we're here
[02:10:53] this is our objective our mission is this we got to put so many troops in there how do we get
[02:11:00] and usually it was it just one place it was if it was a company plus it would be maybe three different
[02:11:06] places we'd have to go and I never would say okay this is how we're going to do it you're
[02:11:12] gonna do I say how do we get there what what's the best approach to make this happen and I was
[02:11:19] the operational and I'd have these young one officers oh let's do this to do it and somebody's
[02:11:24] not an advocate that we're gonna do this so I said well let's do it this way well okay well
[02:11:29] let's take a piece of that next thing you know they had planned the operation all I did was
[02:11:36] approve it but that that's a leadership skill that I learned from people like Colonel Bobby
[02:11:49] Fernando who never said you're gonna do it this way he always sort of facilitated if you
[02:11:57] will facilitated leadership and that's what you're seeing now in business facilitated
[02:12:02] leadership getting people involved and if the more you involve the more you take ownership
[02:12:09] and that's what I saw in our guys that's what I saw in our guys
[02:12:15] during the lambson that's what I saw in our guys after lambson
[02:12:20] now we were a fine commander to troll north we did what they told us to
[02:12:25] they had a very specific way of doing things and that's the way we're gonna do it
[02:12:32] and that's fine and that's fine but this is the way we did it and I mirrored my
[02:12:42] leadership style after people that I had great respect for
[02:12:46] to include General Hellmore became Lieutenant General Hellmore and the way that the
[02:12:55] Comerada the the sub not Comerada I don't want to say I was buddy buddy but General
[02:13:00] Moore because I was not but we had a we had a relationship in the cockpit and I think he
[02:13:05] respected my desires what I wanted to obviously did because I went to go to nom had an odd
[02:13:11] man for that yeah I don't know if you didn't have a relationship with Hal Moore but
[02:13:16] Jesus if you were friends with him who knows what he would have done for you
[02:13:20] what a great man he was but but I left I left vet nom filling very good about
[02:13:27] my unit and about what we did I did change my views a bit to think that
[02:13:36] my tour and nom will be successful if I can do things to support my US troops
[02:13:47] so that change from supporting the whole concept of vitanization
[02:13:53] for example if I can bring ice cream out to those troops after they busted their butt all day
[02:13:58] inserting then I've done something that I can be proud of and that's where my
[02:14:09] mind sort of changed after being in country for about eight months to support my
[02:14:15] soldiers and to do what I could to bring them home yeah the leadership stuff
[02:14:24] you're talking about that's exactly the the best leaders I had was they would tell us
[02:14:29] what the mission was what the goal was and then say come up with a plan and that's what I always
[02:14:33] tried to do myself that's certainly is the the best way to get the people on board with the
[02:14:39] plan is just let them come up with it that's right don't have to convince them of anything
[02:14:43] that it's their idea it's their plan let them argue it out yeah yep so when you did uh
[02:14:50] so what what when when did you leave you now it was in October of 71 and uh
[02:15:05] and nom there was four officers that lived in the same hooch um well I had our little private
[02:15:12] rooms at the corner of this rectangle or hooch then the center was a common area and we had a
[02:15:18] little stove in the common area and so on but um right across for me was an officer a stand dodge
[02:15:27] he was coming to her one eight and so when we would fly when I knew he was flying a go
[02:15:35] being an air then hot he and I would choose a frequency that we would come up on just and
[02:15:42] would fly follow with each other near so let's sort of look in after each other you know in the air
[02:15:47] so I came back from from nom it's very interesting story uh there was me as a common chair
[02:15:56] and then there were three other pilots who were kings my neighbor and bravo company
[02:16:00] 101st aviation which was our sister company and uh we all knew each other and we all came back we were
[02:16:07] in our cackies where in our flight jackets and you know we thought our Sierra didn't stink
[02:16:12] and we get back into Seattle Tacoma and uh got walt through the airport nobody's
[02:16:21] spitting on us nobody yelling at us nobody called us baby killers and we got a taxi we come into
[02:16:29] and we say hey uh is there a holiday any says yeah there's one downtown so he takes us to the holiday
[02:16:34] and we all check in our rooms we clean up we come down to the bar to meet before we go
[02:16:42] have some dinner we get to the bar of course we're all you know we're all got flight pay they
[02:16:47] paid us before we leave nom you know we're all loaded with money more than we should have had
[02:16:53] and we get into the bar and bartenders are what big guys and go to wherever flight jackets on
[02:16:58] you know and they were feeling kind of smuggled and we all ordered drinks and
[02:17:04] one of them said hey everybody else is drink their next drink it's own all of it's own us
[02:17:13] so we all threw in money we bought everybody in the bar that was sitting there their next drink
[02:17:18] and there was a couple he was playing piano and she was singing and uh they were like the
[02:17:27] what's that the carpenters okay that's and she was singing they were doing all the
[02:17:32] carpenters on and so she dedicated a special song she says he says exclamation gentlemen
[02:17:39] but the next drink that all of y'all will get tonight are from these four guys standing at the
[02:17:45] bar in uniform they all just returned from Vietnam and let's give them around to applause now
[02:17:52] stood up give us a round of applause and then she said I'm going to dedicate this next song
[02:17:58] to these guys and it was very special and we didn't buy another drink that night
[02:18:08] we all had stakes they were all paid for and it they quit playing at one o'clock
[02:18:16] and this guy came up to us and said hey we're a bunch of us are here on an insurance convention
[02:18:22] we'd like to take y'all out for breakfast so they took us out to breakfast and we all got to bed
[02:18:28] about five o'clock in the morning and then we all flew out our separate ways the next day
[02:18:35] but it was telling you about stand dodge standing parents lived in Arizona to sign and
[02:18:46] he said and he had left country about a month before I did so he said I want to have a little
[02:18:51] together in my house if you don't mind staying over one day before you make it back so I flew into
[02:18:58] Tucson and he had a couple don't at dollars there who were in the hundred and first
[02:19:07] they were there in fact stand married one of the don't at dollars barber
[02:19:13] and Terry Digan was a friend of mine she was there and plus one guy from bravo company
[02:19:21] the Kingsman and and another pilot but we partied hearty that night and stand
[02:19:27] parents just did a wonderful job of making us feel at home and so on and might have been there
[02:19:35] two nights I stayed because I had to have time to get my uniform cleaned up for a
[02:19:39] warm home I wanted to make sure it was strapped when my parents saw me and so I got my uniform
[02:19:46] got my shoes all spit shot everything caught the plane out of Phoenix and Terry was with me and
[02:19:54] Terry and I had a really nice relationship I mean it wasn't a sexual thing it was just a nice
[02:20:00] relationship we understood each other and she had left none two months before I did and she
[02:20:06] would write me letters telling me about how the world back in the States was not the world it
[02:20:11] was not the real world world world her what she experienced in Vietnam with the soldier
[02:20:19] and that was the real world you know we we would write back a fourth about that and uh
[02:20:25] I flew my flight took us to Shivas from Downers Grove Illinois so we flew to Chicago and then
[02:20:34] obviously catch a plane for Chicago to Charlotte and she wanted me to meet her parents and
[02:20:42] and I wanted to meet her parents too and now I could have probably had a relationship with Terry
[02:20:48] that would have gone beyond she ended up marrying an army ranger a several years later that she
[02:20:54] had known and not but uh kept waiting for her parents to come and my flight was coming up to go
[02:21:00] in a parent's handshot up yet and I never did get to be to parents we finally gave a hug and
[02:21:05] kiss goodbye and I got on the plane and flew to Charlotte and that's where my parents met me
[02:21:12] but I think having those couple days to it's a decompress before I got home
[02:21:19] it's probably psychologically good for me yeah that's uh one thing they always point out world
[02:21:26] were two the guys when the world was over they got on ships and sailed home together for four
[02:21:31] weeks or six weeks and they got to decompress and tell stories and get stuff off their chest and
[02:21:35] whatever and in Vietnam it was like oh you're in Vietnam today and then the next day you're home
[02:21:40] and you don't have your friends with you and you're in random you know main town USA or mainstream
[02:21:45] USA and that that can be a challenge so let's fast forward uh I was home 30 days reassigned
[02:21:53] to Fort Dickson, New Jersey um not an aviation uh I was actually working for a facility that
[02:22:03] processed a wall and disorder soldiers that were brought back into the army but every Friday night
[02:22:10] all the aviators they go home take off their fatigues put on their flat suits
[02:22:15] but all gathered around in one little portion of the offshore club bar and would sit there and
[02:22:22] we had reminisce and tell war stories and and it got emotional at times it which
[02:22:30] might come on to buy alcohol by another beer you know but that's a part of the decompression
[02:22:35] and that those were very special times to sit there and talk about that and people have often asked
[02:22:43] me what what kind of problems did you have and I said well really didn't have any problems
[02:22:48] when I came back and and they you know well you must have been tough I said what I wasn't tough
[02:22:54] I said I think it's just the process of what how we all would get together and talk about our
[02:22:59] experiences and I said these guys that came back from nom after being in combat especially
[02:23:05] infantry guys grunts as we call them uh they would come back they go to Fort Lewis their
[02:23:11] process of the army then they'd go home and they didn't have an opportunity to sit around and
[02:23:15] many of those were subjected to some very harsh treatments when they when they arrived home and I never
[02:23:22] had fortunately never had that experience so I think the army's learning a lot of that all the
[02:23:29] services are learning a lot about that about how do we take care of our veterans after they've been
[02:23:34] I mean you were in hell of a lot of horrific situations that that could have mentally
[02:23:45] had a horrible impact on you but you've worked through that yourself Joke.
[02:23:52] Yeah I mean I think I always talk about the fact that I've talked about it,
[02:23:57] written about it, talk to my friends about it and I think that's like you said it's what you're
[02:24:02] kind of got to do and you know the I look back now in the first the from my last deployment for
[02:24:07] to Ramadi we got home and we were pretty yeah what's a good word here we were pretty wild when we
[02:24:18] got back we were pretty wild when we got back and but you know we kept it under you know we kept we
[02:24:24] looked out for each other make sure that we were wild without you know doing anything that's going
[02:24:29] to cause a reprobable damage or cause some kind of major significant problem but we were definitely
[02:24:35] wild I mean they're no doubt about it and then you know I don't know if it was maybe six months maybe
[02:24:40] a year or something like that you know we started getting back to kind of just doing what we were
[02:24:44] doing a little bit more normal but yeah we were we're pretty wild when we got back.
[02:24:48] Well you know if my excuse was I was you got pretty drunk last night so well I'm an
[02:24:57] heavier yeah yeah we had some you know we all kind a bunch of us lived in the kind of the same area
[02:25:04] too same little neighborhood and so yeah we would go out we'd meet up and we'd go we'd go pretty hard.
[02:25:12] I think I think for me I'm still it's amazing the older I get now and I'll be 76 and all
[02:25:19] this the memories become more vivid now I dream about this more I'm hearing from people we have a
[02:25:36] we have our own common chiro website and you can tell by the comments that Lampson 719
[02:25:46] had a major major psychological impact on our guys and there were some guys that measured
[02:25:55] their time in service oh I was I came after 719 or I left just before 719 so they say that
[02:26:02] some of them came an anchor to describe where one was at one's time flying with the common cherries
[02:26:17] and when when Matt called me up and asked me what I do some collaboration on this book
[02:26:26] in some ways I was pleased in some ways I was a little frightened to bring up
[02:26:38] the experiences and I'll be perfectly honest I had a lot of anxiety coming here today
[02:26:43] though I read this book and a number of times read undolented valor 719 quite a few times I've
[02:26:55] air marked it I've read after action reports on it that hopefully Matt had any did yet some
[02:27:06] of these after action reports that he took his data from but still sitting here now and talking
[02:27:16] about it with you and you weren't there I can talk about it with somebody it was there and but
[02:27:25] and not have anxiety but you weren't there and often wonder I'm telling you this
[02:27:33] but what are you actually hearing because you weren't there and you can tell me about what you did
[02:27:42] and I can listen to it but I wasn't there and so there's a difference yeah there's there's always
[02:27:51] going to be a little gap or a big gap depending on you know the person's experiences and
[02:27:57] you know one thing I think is interesting about you know we start talking about coming home
[02:28:02] and what you're going through I think the one thing that's good is if people actually understand
[02:28:09] what they're feeling a little bit and I remember like you get a new guy that's overseas
[02:28:15] and I look at a new guy that's overseas and you could tell the nervous right and you know
[02:28:20] to say something like hey man you know you that feeling you get in your stomach and maybe like
[02:28:25] you know trying not to tell you but then they admit to it and I go yeah you're just an
[02:28:29] nervous it's your that your body getting ready to go fight it's totally normal that's where you
[02:28:34] should feel like and they'd be okay oh you oh by the way you won't be able to sleep tonight because
[02:28:39] we got a operation tomorrow you're not going to be able to sleep tonight so that's just the way
[02:28:42] it is don't worry about it and I think the same thing coming home you know it's like oh oh you're
[02:28:47] going to get you're going to get sad sometimes it doesn't mean your week it doesn't mean your
[02:28:52] trapped in the past it just means you miss your friends and that's okay and so if you are thinking
[02:28:57] about something and it makes you cry hey yeah that's what that's what happens you know that's the
[02:29:02] way it is and I think if people understand that that's that's that's normal then they're okay well
[02:29:10] that's that's just what's gonna happen it's okay and I think when people don't think it's normal
[02:29:15] and all of a sudden they think I can't control my emotions or I'm scared or I'm sad and I shouldn't
[02:29:20] be sad and I shouldn't be scared it's like no it's it's time no big deal that's the way it is you
[02:29:24] you do your job you you know you're going to be scared you got the you got the crazy stomach you
[02:29:29] can't sleep at night okay cool yeah guess what there's a bunch of other guys that's not sleeping
[02:29:34] tonight either no big deal no big deal oh you get home you you're going to feel sad you're going to
[02:29:39] miss your friends yeah we all miss them that that's the way it is that that's okay and I think that
[02:29:45] helps people out a lot to be able to just say okay what I'm feeling is not an isolated thing
[02:29:52] it's just the way human beings process the the tough experiences that they go through
[02:29:59] but you know we we both served in the kind of service that at one time you didn't show that
[02:30:07] emotion yeah and you weren't expected to I think the service and I hope I've read that they have
[02:30:16] I've seen interviews that they have that now that's been taking consideration it's okay to express
[02:30:24] what you're feeling right now it's okay to go seek counseling because it's not going to end
[02:30:29] up on your Austria-Festival report or your annual report or whatever reports you're going to get
[02:30:37] and so I think that has been a great improvement with the way we receive
[02:30:44] our war fighting men and women especially those who have come back and been engaged in combat
[02:30:54] one thing I'll say about the getting excited and nervous about the upcoming mission
[02:31:03] and I would do the same thing of Vietnam I mean people said were you scared said well how
[02:31:07] yeah I'm scared but hey you know this is what we signed up to do and this is what we're going
[02:31:13] to do and a lot of times I mean I'd said that trying to convince myself but see I was a
[02:31:21] Paton commander I can sit there and tell my trips oh my god I'm scared death are good
[02:31:25] ah I had to put on the show I had to do that but the interesting thing about it is once we
[02:31:33] strapped on that helicopter and we took off in flight all of that right it all right I mean
[02:31:42] it never amazed me got a job to do well yeah I mean you were busy you were monitoring
[02:31:48] through your adios you were you know talking to the crew there I mean it all drained I mean
[02:31:54] even going into even going into the lowlands that that morning when we were doing non-in-offs
[02:31:59] approach and we should have been done 60 or 40 and we were coming in there and but you
[02:32:05] soccer that thing back in that damn nose pigeon's up and you're saying oh hell I hope my
[02:32:08] tail rotor done hit the ground and then you put that sucker down and you're taking fire all the
[02:32:13] place you don't have time to be scared you you you react by the training that you've had
[02:32:23] and by God that training was good yeah yeah exactly and that's I think the same way everybody
[02:32:29] feels I mean if you're going to be nervous it's usually before an operation and for me I was
[02:32:34] always just more nervous about my my friends my guys that's what I was always worried about
[02:32:38] hey I hope nothing happens to the guys you know but then once for us it's once the breach goes you
[02:32:44] know what once the breach goes now it's on everybody knows we're here we're doing what we're doing
[02:32:48] you know once we leave the magate front gate you're you're doing your job and there's
[02:32:53] no time to think about that you can't you can't waste any mental capacity thinking about what
[02:32:59] could happen or what might go happen because you got to do your job and you don't want to
[02:33:02] have anything else in your head besides hey what do I need to do right now how can I do my best
[02:33:07] job right now that's what I'm thinking about but again I seen some nervous new guys and just
[02:33:15] hey man it's all right no big deal and and I think that helps people a lot just like anything anytime
[02:33:21] you can give somebody a heads up about what's about to happen or what I've had this feeling with
[02:33:25] the training MMA fighters mix martial arts fighters to go and fight and I saw the exact same thing
[02:33:31] this is kind of where I started putting it together oh I tell them hey oh you're stomach a little
[02:33:35] crazy yeah I'm super nervous yeah you're supposed to be you're getting ready going to a fight
[02:33:38] yeah it's okay and that would put them at ease because they'd realize oh this is just normal
[02:33:43] this is just me getting ready going to you know that form of sporting combat
[02:33:49] I think but but but add to that I think it's good to be a little nervous for sure
[02:33:54] because you're more own your game for sure and and that's one thing that's one thing general
[02:34:03] John Amar's told me he was a mentor of mine and later on in my service and he was one that
[02:34:11] actually encouraged me to take the civilian position with the sick death because I was doing a
[02:34:18] strategic planning work for him after I had retired from the uniform service and we had this
[02:34:25] we had this big strategic planning conference coming up and I said sir I'd like to bring
[02:34:32] doctor so and so we're in from George Washington University he's been he's been a big critical
[02:34:39] thinker he sort of plans okay this is where we have to be how do we get there kind of a thing
[02:34:46] because we were doing strategic planning yeah the vision is where you want to be now how do we
[02:34:51] go for where we are today to make it vision or reality and he said I don't even work for me
[02:34:59] I said but two years sir he said do you have a PhD I said no sir's master's degree
[02:35:09] he said well I trust you I don't know this guy and that's that's a leadership style that
[02:35:21] that breeds confidence and your soldiers and your employees I got confidence in you I don't know
[02:35:30] this guy so doctor what's his name I never heard him come in to do some work for us but that may be
[02:35:40] feel great yeah so how much longer did you do in the honor me before you retired? I was last
[02:35:47] but 20 years in uniform 68 88 then I immediately before that general Mars it was talking to me about
[02:35:58] he said you're never going to make Colonel God Branch transferred from infantry to the
[02:36:03] armies as an general corps which is a administrative corps you are me and he said I want you to take
[02:36:11] this job the second half has been impressed with work he been doing and said your office will be
[02:36:19] here with me but you'll be working out of the office of the second half and at that time
[02:36:23] us with the defense communications agency which became now the defense information assistance
[02:36:28] agency but my office was there I had clients all military clients all over it was just
[02:36:33] communications guys underseek death was one of my clients the sink US Atlantic command general
[02:36:43] jack she-hand I don't know if you bet general she-head or general she-head or outstanding outstanding
[02:36:50] warrior great leader general Mike Stale who commanded US Army Pacific just to tremendous
[02:36:58] guy the underseeker the offensive logistics I got a chest to do strategic planning work for him
[02:37:03] quite a few organizations in NATO two organizations at shape and that's that's all because
[02:37:10] of a guy my name is John Mars that supported me and paid the way for me and he believed in me
[02:37:18] and though I had a didn't have a PhD he trusted me is that that what leaders are for me
[02:37:26] indeed and then how long did you how long did you do that for 13 years and then you
[02:37:34] went on full retirement not quite well then I was offered a position in the in civilian career
[02:37:41] in the steel business and I was executive vice president of a steel center
[02:37:49] stayed there from O1 to O9 thought I'd retire went into the insurance business for a
[02:37:57] little bit was it exciting then I decided to retire and now my fiance is still working she represents
[02:38:12] a company called Hancock and Moore it's all custom made furniture some of the most
[02:38:17] high quality furniture you will ever find it's all custom made to to your specifications
[02:38:24] leather upholstery nails finish frames you pick out the whole thing yourself and they build
[02:38:31] it to your specifications she also represents a long called Jessica Charles and a long called
[02:38:38] matelence Smith and our territory is in North Carolina so we never go out of North Carolina
[02:38:44] but yeah I say I'm retired but now I run with Jan and I take my orders from her
[02:38:52] and so we we man her territory that's outstanding and she's enjoying staying here today because she
[02:39:00] has nothing to share to do that's beautiful thing a little vacation day for a little vacation day
[02:39:07] they before we stop I know there's a couple things that just to mention here what can you give us the
[02:39:12] update I know that I know that Colonel Jackson's been working day to sort of turn this into a movie
[02:39:19] turn at least some of these books into a movie I know there's a go fund me page out there what
[02:39:25] what's the update on on on these opportunities okay well yes as people should probably know
[02:39:34] that takes a lot of money to produce a movie however a undone to the valor lamisson 719 is going to
[02:39:43] be the movie and it's our story of those of us who flew in it who supported it we need to have
[02:39:52] this on the big screen and as Colonel Jackson's desire as well as as mine that this not become
[02:40:00] Hollywood flash in the pan maybe this is going to be an action film movie because lamisson 719 was
[02:40:07] action and he wants the movie to depict what actually happened and if anyone reads the book they
[02:40:14] will know that if the movie depicts a quarter of what's in that book it is going to be on the
[02:40:19] edge of your seat kind of a movie so the events and everything that he's put into the saying
[02:40:25] we're not Hollywood made up events these are true events he's changed some names but these are true events
[02:40:33] he does have several actors who have indicated that they have liked to play major roles in the
[02:40:40] movie there's already a producer on board and the screen rotters are busy writing this but it
[02:40:47] takes money to do this and the go fund me undone to the valor is the place where people who here
[02:40:54] this and feel that they won't this story told whether it's them themselves or their relatives who
[02:41:00] are involved in this or they are just very supportive of what our military has done in the past
[02:41:08] especially what we did in Vietnam which a lot of those stories were not very favorable stories
[02:41:14] this is a very favorable story what we did the nine courage them to do the go fund me undone to valor
[02:41:22] all this money is going to being accepted by a 501c3 group at Fort Campbell Kentucky
[02:41:35] and so Matt gets another this money Matt Jackson gets another this money it's all going towards
[02:41:41] this movie every last set off it's going towards this movie so the quicker we can get this
[02:41:49] and the more we can faster we can proceed with development this movie and obviously encourage
[02:41:56] people to take this into consideration 501c3 so your go nation is tax deductible
[02:42:01] that's outstanding and and I look forward to I look forward to seeing this thing for sure when it
[02:42:06] comes out reading these books sitting here talking to you guys this is just unbelievable part of history
[02:42:11] and a true look at the heroism that you all and American soldiers displayed in Vietnam
[02:42:20] echo Charles do you have any questions I do not no questions from echo Charles if he doesn't ask
[02:42:27] any questions that means he's going to talk a lot later so I have to put up with that but that's just
[02:42:32] the way it is that's part of the punishment I guess for me no and I just just shows the depth that we
[02:42:37] went into you know I'll fill that I'm at the end okay to dump to the detail right I want to thank you
[02:42:43] for ask him to be here and I want to thank Matt Jackson for putting it all together and I'm
[02:42:49] finally glad to meet the man I saw on the damn bun genusia right on anything else Jay no sure
[02:43:01] well again like you said thanks to Colonel Matt Jackson for introducing us and for his
[02:43:06] efforts and writing these books and preserving these these heroic deeds of our combat aviators and
[02:43:14] soldiers in Vietnam war and of course thank you for joining us and sharing your experiences your
[02:43:20] lessons learned and most important thank you thank you for your service and sacrifice to our great
[02:43:28] nation the bravery of you of your fellow pilots of the of the air crews the bravery that you all showed
[02:43:37] can never be questioned and we are grateful for your heroism and the example that you set for all of
[02:43:47] us today thank you thanks for coming on and with that major J. T. has left the building not even much
[02:44:00] to say to follow that up just just mayhem I have a lot to say actually but I won't go into as deep as
[02:44:07] maybe I could but I will say this I was talking to Nick I'll say and whatever we were talking about
[02:44:16] it reminded me of this where like nowadays okay not nowadays but in the Vietnam war there are so many
[02:44:24] people who did so many crazy things but they don't have necessarily a big spotlight on them they're
[02:44:31] just like just kind of cruising now where you don't you know they're not in the spotlight in any
[02:44:38] way they're just like essentially now they're just sort of just living normal people well it's always
[02:44:43] interesting to me that like major J. T. retired in 1988 I came in in 1998 1990 right so there's almost
[02:44:52] overlap there and there's been plenty of old Vietnam guys in the seal teams some but you know I'd
[02:44:59] be meeting some random army dude you know and he could have easily been this guy you know there are
[02:45:06] people in Vietnam that did the craziest stuff and no one knows about it literally things that are
[02:45:12] going to be in a movie literally did those things that are going to be in a movie and people be like
[02:45:17] oh I wonder why they wrote it just made it so crazy yeah where they got us to spend their
[02:45:23] disbelief or what is that suspension yeah they kind of got to do that about something that really
[02:45:27] happened in real life yeah that kind of meanwhile he's just cruising I mean even though I was talking
[02:45:31] to tilt yesterday hell yeah we're actually Saturday we're talking tilt on Saturday and and he was you
[02:45:37] know they amount of times that those guys did crazy things it's unbelievable it's unbelievable and
[02:45:46] no one really knew too much about sag I'm a look if you are if you're deeply into the military
[02:45:51] history and all that but a normal everyday person barely knows anything about sock yeah I didn't
[02:45:58] for sure there's one thing he mentioned that was pretty dark and then he just moved right on
[02:46:02] when he's like you just you don't want to get burned up oh yeah as a pilot he was in the book that was
[02:46:09] in the book lamb song 719 yeah he said how like in world war two like some man we're known yeah
[02:46:16] one more one before parachutes yeah you carry a pistol kill with you catch fire just going to kill
[02:46:20] yourself that's how bad it was yeah that was interesting and it was also interesting and in the first
[02:46:26] book by Matt Jackson he's explaining you know basically that a helicopter doesn't want to fly
[02:46:31] yeah this thing does this is a bunch of metal the gear and oil gears and oil and gas that doesn't
[02:46:39] want to fly if you just let it go it's just going to crash an airplane even if you let go the controls
[02:46:44] it's kind of kind of cruise you know you kind of feel like I'm not a pilot I don't know if you
[02:46:49] do that but it feels like on an in their plane something goes wrong or whatever as long as you got wings
[02:46:55] in the in the tail you can kind of just glide that way in yeah it feels like that so I had a car this
[02:47:00] is how my first deployment to go on parking the do when we get over there all the all the seals
[02:47:08] we'd buy go on bombs we call them just like a piece of junk car whatever you know that you're
[02:47:13] just going to drive around go on for a few for six months and then sell it to the next set so we bought
[02:47:18] our go on bomb from some other team guys that were leaving we had this it was uh I think it was a
[02:47:24] 1977 Velare was beige but here's the thing cars are kind of you'd think cars would be like oh
[02:47:35] you don't really you know if you if you don't touch controls it's just kind of going to go until
[02:47:39] it's just going to go straight to it by stops right yeah this car I don't know what was wrong
[02:47:45] if you let your hands off the wheels it would go into a full hard right turn as hard as you could
[02:47:49] pop you couldn't turn a car to the right as fast as this car would turn for it's own
[02:47:56] go on bomb that was our bomb the full already but also for whatever reason had hot
[02:48:04] scorching air you know you know you know you know the little like area underneath the back window
[02:48:11] on the old school cars there's a little area yeah it's like a back dash yeah you could throw like
[02:48:16] a a a a pair of slippers up there so it may be a t-shirt or sweatshirt right this little area like that
[02:48:22] and there can sometimes be aftermarket speakers be put in there right but there was no there was no
[02:48:29] aftermarket speakers but there was just scorching hot air that came to the side no it's like
[02:48:35] unknown source of massive it would fire through that thing so that car was kind of like a helicopter
[02:48:42] if you'd script your fingers off the controls for a second you were hitting the right guardrail
[02:48:46] in point two seconds oh yeah so yeah when do you get the impression and maybe you probably
[02:48:52] know this even firsthand where just in Vietnam rain wartime just in general like just things are just
[02:48:59] loud the things are so loud and there's so much louder in real life than they are in the movies
[02:49:05] yes I know that's your reference for instance in a helicopter you can't hear anything yes
[02:49:10] so freaking loud it's ridiculous it's punishing on your ears it's so loud and a helicopter
[02:49:17] yeah everything is louder I mean a humv is freaking loud tanks are loud everything's loud
[02:49:25] and everything's just vibrating just your whole world is that yeah it's cool now we got those new
[02:49:31] ear like headsets right that block out loud noises yeah the Kent noise can't slink
[02:49:38] that he said something about one the first I think it was like the first time where he
[02:49:43] heard the M60 when when he was and how we'd like vibrate the the thing and that's what I was
[02:49:51] like the whole thing is just loud no your whole world is just loud up there because you got the
[02:49:55] helicopter then you got the guns and everything is vibrating loud just the hostile the other
[02:50:01] interesting thing is I think of hewis I think of hewis as being old right in my mind they're old
[02:50:08] because I flew around on hewis and they were old kind of like when you think of a bomber right
[02:50:13] now like a world war two bomber you think of this old you know those were the most modern
[02:50:19] beasts of their time that was like getting those noise that was like yeah to a noise right
[02:50:23] straight up so well listen obviously like I said at the end there guys like major J.T.
[02:50:33] they said a great example for us on many levels courage we you know like for sure
[02:50:42] capability a hundred percent I'm not sure what we're doing to improve our courage what can we
[02:50:50] do to improve our capabilities. Equitrals there's a softball for you knock it out of the park
[02:50:56] do me a favor capability hey okay we're working out we're on the path
[02:51:01] that's it hundred percent I say on the program by the way you know like when the
[02:51:07] we're different now your wife comes home and it's like oh yeah like do you want some extra
[02:51:12] cheese on the lasagna you know I said no no no I'm on the program so it's kind of okay understand you know
[02:51:18] now you're on the path but here's the thing the path is more broad more encompassing oh yeah
[02:51:23] the program seems like you can easily be off the program in like three four weeks or whatever you know
[02:51:27] it's like that kind of feeling it's not they're not hard and fast rules but I'm just saying the
[02:51:32] feeling is there let's put it this way if you're on the path it's a life yeah it's like life yeah
[02:51:39] you're right programs of temporary yes somewhat yeah they're like a temporary improvement deviation
[02:51:44] whatever either way we're on the path the good thing about the path is sure we have supplementation
[02:51:49] but these are everyday supplementation their life supplementation elements seem saying
[02:51:55] so some of us back in the day we said drink energy drinks junk energy drinks junk
[02:52:03] it's a new um it's a new era of energy drink does a new era of energy drinks now healthy
[02:52:09] energy drinks to kind of when you drink it you get everything front end you get everything you
[02:52:13] wanted energy then on the back end you get everything that you didn't expect but want
[02:52:20] to help and you don't get things that you didn't want jitters no diabetes chemical
[02:52:27] disturbance inside your system some weird addiction inflammation you know this weird stuff
[02:52:33] yeah exactly if we don't want yep none of that none absolutely none so okay so
[02:52:38] jacco discipline go this is the energy drink you've been in no already some new flavors out
[02:52:43] which just adds to the choices you have hey look we all like orange we all like orange it's a staple
[02:52:50] right you hard pressed to find someone who doesn't like orange flavor true yeah cool but
[02:52:56] do we love orange maybe maybe maybe maybe that's okay I don't know if it does I don't just wait good
[02:53:00] do they do they yeah yeah that makes sense totally makes sense but not all of us do some of us like
[02:53:04] more exotic flavors like mango mango has the capability to be like love I love mango oranges
[02:53:12] more like yeah of course I like mango orange seems same what about the other end of the
[02:53:17] spectrum are people more like well mango is not really my thing I'll drink orange but mango is not
[02:53:22] my thing it's possible just saying take one extreme you gotta probably end up with the other one
[02:53:28] as well it's very possible nonetheless we're we're adding to the the spectrum of desirable flavors
[02:53:34] in discipline go so now you got a win win win win situation for everybody three wins three wins
[02:53:39] okay all day maybe even four later just saying it's always improving this good it's good you're
[02:53:44] better off after you drink one of these what about water on what about new water about what
[02:53:48] but what but what but what but salt watermelon yeah same same I think that's closer to orange in terms
[02:53:54] of people it being a more broadly accepted flavor yeah you know anyone that does not like
[02:54:01] watermelon I don't know anyone who does not like what you know and it does not like mango
[02:54:07] yes see psychos but it's like you know some either way I get it I get it into each
[02:54:14] their own I can honestly say that with with the gender you kind of rolled the dice then with the
[02:54:18] mango you know hey yeah actually no because when we chose the mango I chose that because I
[02:54:26] personally like it and that would be little kind of said he said hey if it's you if you like it
[02:54:30] that's it so it's like cool I like it right on well it seems like drinks energy drinks is what you
[02:54:35] were saying you can get them yes sir it's a new air like I said they're good for you the
[02:54:38] thing is that's a big deal though like come on you'd be hard for us to find a good tasting energy
[02:54:44] drink that after you drink it you're better off it's good for you you don't have to do a
[02:54:49] bunch of like health freaking recovery things after you drink energy you don't go to go
[02:54:53] to go on a 14 day detox yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm super low in calories to buy the way also
[02:55:01] what else we got extra protein in the form of a dessert best tasting protein in the world pretty much
[02:55:07] you'd be hard to press to find a better tasting protein with that the health nutrient profile
[02:55:11] that we have the only thing that could possibly taste better as a protein is just steak itself
[02:55:16] it's possible very hard comparison that as we know you can have a gorgeous
[02:55:22] of gorgeous rib eye steak well marble tasty cooked to a tea season to perform season to perfection
[02:55:30] and you can still get that would be like I want something to eat some milk yeah you want to
[02:55:33] cook some milk bread that has been me actually for the last four three out of the last four days
[02:55:38] hundred percent that's interesting either way these are all good things that will keep you on the
[02:55:42] path and front end end back end benefit hundred percent there's nothing better than more
[02:55:46] honestly there's nothing better than milk when you get that little
[02:55:52] you get that that how's this so desire here's a okay so mostly every night
[02:55:58] the little routine mostly every night like a salad yeah as a meal like a big robust chicken it's
[02:56:05] a formula I'd give the recipe some other time but it's legit a bit it's talking about salad
[02:56:09] it's a horrible I see you're a senior is either way but but I'll mix up a milk in there
[02:56:19] in the salad without a salad with the salad give you drink water whatever you drink with salad
[02:56:24] whatever for some reason the milk with the salad is the perfect combo right before
[02:56:27] that that's in my experience check anyway are also we have other stuff too for immunity for
[02:56:34] your joints these are these are things we don't want to worry about on the on this path
[02:56:38] we don't want to worry about how strong our immune system is we don't want to worry about
[02:56:41] our joints working or not working we want to just be sure and be usher it that's the things

[03:04:16] looking things in there the way it's the way it's written it's prose elements I guess yeah uh you can
[03:04:23] check that out you you it's it's available for pre order right now I'm gonna say the publisher likely
[03:04:32] won't print enough because they're always looking to minimize any loss they're looking to maximize
[03:04:39] profit okay that's cool the running company I get it they don't want to print too many copies
[03:04:45] now some copies sitting around so they're gonna minimize they're they're low-balling it
