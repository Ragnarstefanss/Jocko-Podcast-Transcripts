00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jockel Pontcast number 316 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:19.60
I can't get any. December 18th 2018, General Jim Madness resigned as a secretary defense

3
00:00:19.60 --> 00:00:25.000
for Donald Trump and he did that. He wrote a letter and in that letter he said quote

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because you have the right to a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours.

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.16
I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. Then clearly General Madness

6
00:00:39.16 --> 00:00:47.000
did not agree with what Donald Trump was doing or how Donald Trump was doing, what he was doing.

7
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And so he stepped down and you can read that letter online, the letter of resignation and it's

8
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
he did it in as respectfully as he could. I think after he did that, things went a little bit worse

9
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.76
between the two of them. But the initial statement was certainly meant to be done in a

10
00:01:06.76 --> 00:01:13.80
respectful way to from the secretary of defense to the commander and chief, but it was certainly a statement

11
00:01:13.80 --> 00:01:23.80
by him stepping down. When that happened, I was definitely disappointed to see General Madness

12
00:01:23.80 --> 00:01:31.24
leaving that position. And because then it's a situation where he no longer has any influence

13
00:01:31.24 --> 00:01:38.76
over what's happening. And General Madness, I highly respected Marine and leader in the military.

14
00:01:38.76 --> 00:01:46.76
But this kind of thing has happened before. A hard-reline was taken by Colonel David Hackworth

15
00:01:46.76 --> 00:01:53.72
when he spoke out against both military and civilian leadership in his interview

16
00:01:54.28 --> 00:01:59.96
toward the end of the Vietnam War. Interview with a news program called Issues and Answers

17
00:01:59.96 --> 00:02:06.44
Sunday June 7th, 1971. Here's some things. Here's some excerpts from that interview and the whole

18
00:02:06.44 --> 00:02:12.20
interview is in the book about face. But some of the excerpts from that he's been interviewed by a

19
00:02:12.20 --> 00:02:17.40
guy named Mr. Tuckner. Mr. Tuckner said in your view, did poor training lead to higher casualties

20
00:02:17.40 --> 00:02:24.52
in Vietnam? Colonel Hackworth replied, I am convinced of it. I think that our casualties were at least

21
00:02:24.52 --> 00:02:31.08
30% higher because of or even higher than that. But I'd say just safely 30% because of troops that

22
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:36.60
were not properly trained. I participated in a study group in the Pentagon in 67 and 68,

23
00:02:37.32 --> 00:02:42.44
which considered U.S. casualties caused by friendly fires. And the group was composed of highly

24
00:02:42.44 --> 00:02:46.84
experienced personnel that had served in Vietnam and it was our conclusion that 15 to 20% of the

25
00:02:46.84 --> 00:02:52.84
casualties caused in Vietnam were the result of friendly fire. One man shooting another man, artillery,

26
00:02:52.84 --> 00:02:59.72
friendly fire, friendly artillery fire firing on a friendly element. Friendly helicopters firing on a

27
00:02:59.72 --> 00:03:06.52
friendly unit. Tuck air strike on a friendly unit. And I could count you in my own case, countless

28
00:03:06.52 --> 00:03:12.84
personal examples. For example, during the Battle of Dactu, June of the 17th, the rocket ship came

29
00:03:12.84 --> 00:03:17.80
into my A company's position by mistake and released its rockets right on top of the company

30
00:03:17.80 --> 00:03:26.12
killing the executive officer and wounding 29 other troopers. I can recall in September of 1965

31
00:03:26.12 --> 00:03:31.88
as my battalion was deployed artillery was fired in the wrong place killing seven men in one of my

32
00:03:31.88 --> 00:03:40.28
pletounds. The interview goes on. Mr. Tuckerner says, the upper echelon of the army

33
00:03:40.28 --> 00:03:47.80
really ever become changed on this war. Did they learn from their mistakes? Colonel Hackworth,

34
00:03:47.80 --> 00:03:53.56
I don't think so. I don't think that the top level ever developed the realistic strategic plan

35
00:03:53.56 --> 00:03:59.96
nor did they ever have tactics to support that strategic plan. And that is why perhaps we

36
00:03:59.96 --> 00:04:05.72
who have not been vocal should be charged for criminal neglect because it is our obligation.

37
00:04:05.72 --> 00:04:10.60
It is our responsibility not only to train our soldiers well, to lead our soldiers well,

38
00:04:10.60 --> 00:04:15.24
but to make sure that there are no mistakes made. That they are protected as well as possible

39
00:04:15.24 --> 00:04:20.84
from mistakes in error. And once you make mistakes, they must be surfaced, critiqued,

40
00:04:20.84 --> 00:04:31.08
identified, and remedial action taken. The interview goes on and it closes out with this,

41
00:04:31.08 --> 00:04:38.28
Mr. Tuckerner asks, Colonel, do you feel it is possible? You have become too emotionally involved

42
00:04:38.28 --> 00:04:46.20
in Vietnam. Colonel Hackworth replies, I have become emotionally involved in Vietnam.

43
00:04:46.20 --> 00:04:51.48
One couldn't have spent the number of years I have spent Vietnam without becoming emotionally

44
00:04:51.48 --> 00:04:56.52
involved. One couldn't see the number of young studs die or be terribly wounded without

45
00:04:56.52 --> 00:05:02.76
becoming emotionally involved. I just have seen the American nation spend so much of it's wonderful

46
00:05:02.76 --> 00:05:07.48
great young men in this country. I've seen our national wealth being drained away. I see the

47
00:05:07.48 --> 00:05:12.76
nation being split apart and almost being split a sonner because of this war. And I am wondering

48
00:05:12.76 --> 00:05:26.28
to what end it is all going to lead to? Obviously, Hackworth was drummed out of the army shortly after

49
00:05:26.28 --> 00:05:34.12
that interview. Hackworth and Mattis are not the first people to resign in protest or because they

50
00:05:34.12 --> 00:05:42.04
didn't agree with what was happening. In fact, another guy that Hackworth refers to this general

51
00:05:42.92 --> 00:05:47.80
William Billy Mitchell, father of the Air Force World War I, commanded the first aircraft,

52
00:05:47.80 --> 00:05:53.48
our first American aircraft, World War I and after the war he started to build the Air Force.

53
00:05:54.60 --> 00:06:00.92
And guess what? The army and the Navy kind of objected to it because they thought that their ways were

54
00:06:00.92 --> 00:06:09.88
better. And he conducted field tests against Navy ships, use an aircraft and proved that we need

55
00:06:09.88 --> 00:06:19.32
it air power. And there was a Navy air ship like a blimp called the Shannon Della crashed in

56
00:06:19.32 --> 00:06:27.40
1925, 14 crew were killed. And Mitchell, general Mitchell protested to the press openly accusing

57
00:06:27.40 --> 00:06:34.84
the war department of quote incompetence and criminal negligence saying quote, brave airmen are

58
00:06:34.84 --> 00:06:40.44
being sent to their deaths by armchair animals who don't care about their safety. Mitchell was

59
00:06:40.44 --> 00:06:47.80
court-martialed, convicted of an insubordination and facing a five-year suspension he resigned his

60
00:06:47.80 --> 00:06:58.04
commission. 1949. The Secretary of the Navy resigned as the construction of the supercarrier

61
00:06:58.04 --> 00:07:05.08
the USS United States was cut to pay for the Air Force B36 Long Range bomber program.

62
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.44
If you ever read the book, Derr-Election of Duty by a German master, another highly respected

63
00:07:16.44 --> 00:07:23.72
general. And one of the things he refers to during the Vietnam War that the joint chiefs of staff

64
00:07:23.72 --> 00:07:31.48
for Lyndon B. Johnson, he calls them five silent men because they didn't push back on some of the

65
00:07:31.48 --> 00:07:37.64
things or a lot of the things or all of the things that LBJ and McNamara were doing.

66
00:07:37.64 --> 00:07:46.52
The Army Chief, Harold Johnson, General Harold Johnson, said after his retirement. After he retired.

67
00:07:47.56 --> 00:07:51.16
He said quote, I remember the day I was ready to go over to the overall office and give my

68
00:07:51.16 --> 00:07:56.12
four stars to the president and tell him quote, you have refused to tell the country they cannot

69
00:07:56.12 --> 00:07:59.88
fight a war without mobilization. You have required me to send men into battle with little

70
00:07:59.88 --> 00:08:04.60
hope of their ultimate victory and you have forced us into the military and forced the military

71
00:08:04.60 --> 00:08:09.96
to violate almost every one of the principles of war in Vietnam. Therefore, I resigned and I will

72
00:08:09.96 --> 00:08:18.04
hold a press conference after I walk out of your door. But of course he didn't do that. That's

73
00:08:18.04 --> 00:08:26.28
something he said later. General Wallace Green, Marine Corps, Marine Corps Chief.

74
00:08:26.28 --> 00:08:35.000
And this is a guy that in World War II fought the Japanese with a 45 caliber pistol and a

75
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:44.04
bay in that. And he says in that same book, in that book, by McMaster, he says something along the lines

76
00:08:44.04 --> 00:08:48.92
of, well, if I resign in protest, okay, I'm in the headlines for 48 hours, then what?

77
00:08:48.92 --> 00:08:52.60
Then I'm gone and someone else carries on. I don't have an impact. And that's a decent point.

78
00:08:52.60 --> 00:08:59.24
It's a legitimate point made by Green. Same thing I said about matters. When you leave, again,

79
00:08:59.24 --> 00:09:02.44
it's a decision. But when you leave, you've got to realize that your influence has gone.

80
00:09:06.84 --> 00:09:17.24
1968, Cyrus Vance, who was a World War II Navy Gunner officer, he did resign as LBJ's

81
00:09:17.24 --> 00:09:24.20
deputy secretary of defense in protest to what was going on in Vietnam, which he initially believed in

82
00:09:24.20 --> 00:09:29.24
Vietnam War. But as he saw it unfold, he said, this is not a good idea and he eventually resigned.

83
00:09:31.72 --> 00:09:37.40
He also later resigned as a secretary of state for Carter, for Jimmy Carter, in protest of

84
00:09:37.40 --> 00:09:45.24
desert one, because he thought that we should negotiate more. He did that two times.

85
00:09:45.24 --> 00:09:52.76
I don't think either one of them had a huge impact. 1997 Air Force Chief of Staff decorated Vietnam

86
00:09:52.76 --> 00:09:59.80
War pilot resigned at the perceived punishment that was to be imposed on the commanders on the

87
00:09:59.80 --> 00:10:09.56
ground when the co-bar towers were attacked in Saudi Arabia. 2006, a guy named Aaron Watata,

88
00:10:09.56 --> 00:10:13.96
Army refused to go to Iraq and believe in the war resigned.

89
00:10:18.12 --> 00:10:26.36
Matthew Ho, a former Marine infantry officer. In 2009, resigned in protest as a senior

90
00:10:26.36 --> 00:10:32.52
political civilian representative in Zabbal Province in Afghanistan, wrote a scathing letter.

91
00:10:32.52 --> 00:10:44.04
Can read that online. 2021 Lieutenant Colonel Paul Douglas Hague resigned in objection to quote

92
00:10:44.04 --> 00:10:52.44
traitorous withdrawal from Afghanistan and also talked about an ideological Marxist takeover

93
00:10:52.44 --> 00:11:05.64
of the military and the United States government at the repression lines resigned. So, these things happen.

94
00:11:07.96 --> 00:11:11.40
And I talked about this in the book, Leader of Strasgeon Tactics. I talked about

95
00:11:12.20 --> 00:11:17.96
when you should do this, how you make that decision, because when you resign or even when you speak

96
00:11:17.96 --> 00:11:24.28
out aggressively and ostracize yourself as a leader, you no longer have influence over the situation.

97
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.64
You're gone. Maybe your statement will bring about enough

98
00:11:36.92 --> 00:11:42.84
highlight. We'll bring enough light on the subject that you can help, that your resignation can help.

99
00:11:42.84 --> 00:11:53.40
That's what you hope for. But it's not guaranteed. And you may cause excess conflict inside

100
00:11:53.40 --> 00:12:00.92
the organization you're trying to help. But then there are times when things have gone too far

101
00:12:01.72 --> 00:12:06.68
or a line has been crossed in your head and you feel you just simply cannot tolerate

102
00:12:06.68 --> 00:12:16.04
things the way they are. And you've tried to use internal methods to influence the situation,

103
00:12:16.04 --> 00:12:25.08
but it hasn't worked. So you step out and you speak out. And this is happened recently.

104
00:12:25.48 --> 00:12:31.16
I'm reading horror, Lieutenant Colonel, Stewart Scheller, spoke out about the disastrous

105
00:12:31.16 --> 00:12:39.32
withdrawal from Afghanistan. I need to do this publicly and without authorization from his

106
00:12:39.32 --> 00:12:47.48
chain of command. And for that and for other actions that he took he was relieved of his command.

107
00:12:47.48 --> 00:12:54.36
He was a prisoned court martial, punished, required to depart the Marine Corps without retirement

108
00:12:54.36 --> 00:13:02.68
or benefits, which is a steep price to pay to speak your mind on what you're seeing and that

109
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:09.32
is a hard decision to make. And it has consequences that will reverberate for years.

110
00:13:10.92 --> 00:13:19.08
They have lessons. Hard lessons will be learned. And tonight we have a chance to learn some of

111
00:13:19.08 --> 00:13:26.60
those lessons directly from the source as Stewart Scheller, former Lieutenant Colonel, former

112
00:13:26.60 --> 00:13:35.48
United States Marine, is here with us tonight to discuss what happened. Stu, thanks for joining us.

113
00:13:36.12 --> 00:13:40.28
Jack, thanks for having me that intro gave me chills, really laid that up for y'all.

114
00:13:40.28 --> 00:13:43.72
I'm so excited to be here, Peco, out of the port of the conversation.

115
00:13:43.72 --> 00:13:50.44
Let's start at the beginning just to get some background on you as a human. So where do you grow up?

116
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:56.60
I grew up across the Midwest. My dad was just an insurance salesman. I worked his way up.

117
00:13:56.60 --> 00:14:01.56
So we moved between Missouri, Kansas, Ohio. I ended up going to high school in college at the

118
00:14:01.56 --> 00:14:07.24
University of Cincinnati, high school in Cincinnati too. Then I moved out to Virginia again,

119
00:14:07.24 --> 00:14:10.76
accounting degree at the University of Missouri. When you were in high school, what was your mom

120
00:14:10.76 --> 00:14:16.20
working? Mom was a state at home. Mom, so I've got two brothers in a sister. So four siblings,

121
00:14:16.20 --> 00:14:21.08
she was always there for us driving us to soccer practice. I was a baseball soccer player.

122
00:14:21.64 --> 00:14:27.08
Any good? Yeah, I was a all-state soccer player. I got a full ride, played a couple of seasons.

123
00:14:27.08 --> 00:14:32.36
And yeah, I was always a captain, always a leader, enjoyed competitive sports.

124
00:14:33.16 --> 00:14:38.92
Did you make it to the state champion tubes? You know, in Ohio they had, I don't know if they

125
00:14:38.92 --> 00:14:43.40
still got it, but they had a, it was called ODP. It was like a Olympic development program.

126
00:14:43.40 --> 00:14:47.88
So you got to try out for these regional ODP teams and I made the team and I don't think we ever

127
00:14:47.88 --> 00:14:52.76
won anything significant. What position did you play? I played all over. I mean, I played club high

128
00:14:52.76 --> 00:14:58.20
school college. So usually I was a skinny runner. I was a lot of skinnier back in the day. I was probably

129
00:14:58.20 --> 00:15:03.08
you know, 140 through high school. So I was usually outside half back sprinting, but as I got a little

130
00:15:03.08 --> 00:15:06.68
more muscle, they put me back in the defense. And then when I got to college, I was again

131
00:15:06.68 --> 00:15:12.20
smaller, so they quickly back on the outside midfield. And were you into school getting good grades

132
00:15:12.20 --> 00:15:16.60
in all that? Yeah, schools always come pretty easy for me. So I was always on the honor roll.

133
00:15:16.60 --> 00:15:23.08
I put in the work. I always got 35 to 40. Yeah. I mean, I'd say if you put in the work? Yeah.

134
00:15:24.44 --> 00:15:30.68
That's a big, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I like to have fun. I like to play sports. And so school wasn't

135
00:15:30.68 --> 00:15:35.32
always my focus, but I knew getting a good education and you know, wanting to build a good

136
00:15:35.32 --> 00:15:39.64
base was important. So if I put in the work of homework, I'd always do well. But there were

137
00:15:39.64 --> 00:15:43.16
times where I just wouldn't do it. And then you know, you pay the consequences. Did you have interest

138
00:15:43.16 --> 00:15:49.80
in the military growing up? I didn't. So my grandfather landed at Normandy. And I looked up to him a

139
00:15:49.80 --> 00:15:55.56
lot, but after his army service and World War II, he got out was in the federal service. And his

140
00:15:55.56 --> 00:15:59.16
brother was in the FBI. So that's why I got my accounting degree. They were telling me, get your accounting

141
00:15:59.16 --> 00:16:05.000
degree, you can go in the FBI. So I always loved America. I always wanted to serve. But no one in my

142
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.56
immediate family, other than my grandfather was in the military. So through high school, all I knew

143
00:16:09.56 --> 00:16:15.000
was I needed to go to college and get a degree. Then a good job would be on the backside. And I was

144
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.44
getting an accounting degree. And I thought maybe I'd go in a federal service. But that was kind of

145
00:16:18.44 --> 00:16:21.96
my thought process all the way through school. What year did you graduate high school?

146
00:16:21.96 --> 00:16:26.84
2000 high school, 2004 college. So September 11th happened when you were in college?

147
00:16:26.84 --> 00:16:30.84
That's right. So was it, was it, was it, was kind of impacted that have on you? Yeah, good question. So

148
00:16:30.84 --> 00:16:37.16
I was my sophomore season of soccer. And we had I was living in the dorms. And it was like a

149
00:16:37.16 --> 00:16:41.96
sweet where it was like four bedrooms in the living room. And I remember sitting there with my teammates

150
00:16:41.96 --> 00:16:47.40
watching it and thinking, well, this is significant. Our lives are going to change. But I don't know

151
00:16:47.40 --> 00:16:52.84
how this is going to impact me. And then like I said, I just went back to, I need to graduate college

152
00:16:52.84 --> 00:16:56.84
as well as what I'm supposed to do. So even most of my peers joined after September 11th and that

153
00:16:56.84 --> 00:17:01.88
was like their motivation. It was different for me. Mine came a little bit later. So I saw September 11th

154
00:17:01.88 --> 00:17:07.000
it impacted me like all Americans. But I continued just going through school. Still not even

155
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.60
sure that I was going to join the military at that time. So at what point did you get serious about

156
00:17:12.60 --> 00:17:17.72
joining the military? So I graduated with that kind of degree. Started working as an account and did

157
00:17:17.72 --> 00:17:24.60
not enjoy working as an account. And it was 2004. And I was watching the TV and I saw the Marines

158
00:17:24.60 --> 00:17:29.16
moving through Felicia. And I thought, hey, we're going to probably be at war for another five

159
00:17:29.16 --> 00:17:35.08
ten years. I'd love an opportunity to go represent America, be a leader on the edge of the empire.

160
00:17:35.88 --> 00:17:41.16
I've always been competitive being on teams. And I just thought, you know, I could go on the FBI

161
00:17:41.16 --> 00:17:46.44
anytime. But this war may not always be going on and I want the opportunity to serve my country.

162
00:17:46.44 --> 00:17:51.56
And so I called the Marine Recreeter and started my path. So really it was 2004 for me watching

163
00:17:51.56 --> 00:17:55.96
the Marines on TV. There was like, I need to get me some of that. How long were you an account

164
00:17:55.96 --> 00:18:01.32
in a four? Not long. I did it part time as I was going through school. And then I did it for probably

165
00:18:02.68 --> 00:18:08.20
nine months after I graduated. Didn't pick long enough. It was a hit. Grunt and Felicia looked better.

166
00:18:08.20 --> 00:18:13.72
It did. Yeah. You're looking at looking at spreadsheets. 100%. That's not for everybody.

167
00:18:14.84 --> 00:18:20.20
So so how long did the recruiting process take in 2000? And so in 2004 you talked to the

168
00:18:20.20 --> 00:18:23.40
recruiter for the first time? That's right. Yeah, that was quick. I talked to him

169
00:18:24.68 --> 00:18:29.80
probably in September. And the hardest part was getting all the recommendations.

170
00:18:29.80 --> 00:18:33.40
Like, you need college professors recommendations. Like university Cincinnati was like 1,

171
00:18:33.40 --> 00:18:37.56
me 300. None of my instructors knew me. You know, I had a like, call me back up. Like, hey,

172
00:18:37.56 --> 00:18:42.52
you don't know me, but can you fill this out? You know, and I didn't accomplish anything at that

173
00:18:42.52 --> 00:18:47.000
point of my life other than being a soccer captain. So what, what did I have other than a college

174
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.76
degree and being on a sports team? And so you're supposed to write all these accolades and

175
00:18:50.76 --> 00:18:54.28
accomplishments in extracurricular. And so what honestly when I thought about the application,

176
00:18:54.28 --> 00:19:00.12
I was like, they're not going to select me. But I submitted it and my strength was athleticism. So

177
00:19:00.12 --> 00:19:07.24
I smoked the PFT and that was easy for me. And within two months, they selected me and I shipped out

178
00:19:07.24 --> 00:19:12.68
in January. And where's Marine Corros, yes? It's in Quonico. How was that?

179
00:19:12.68 --> 00:19:17.24
I think for some people. How did that compare to accounting? I think for some people,

180
00:19:17.24 --> 00:19:21.24
it's a lot of, there's a lot of prior listed guys to go through. And I didn't know anything about

181
00:19:21.24 --> 00:19:24.04
the military. I mean, I didn't know the difference between officers and enlisted. I didn't know

182
00:19:24.04 --> 00:19:28.76
the drill instructors were going to scream at us. I quite honestly thought I'd show up and it would be

183
00:19:28.76 --> 00:19:34.68
like grown man rules and, you know, here's the challenge figured out. You know, I just, I don't know why

184
00:19:34.68 --> 00:19:39.56
that's what I thought it would be. And it just, it was not that. And so, you know, the drill instructors

185
00:19:39.56 --> 00:19:43.64
all start screaming at you and they have you dump your bags and they kick your stuff all over the

186
00:19:43.64 --> 00:19:48.92
parade deck. And I noticed when they were doing that, all my peers had their stuff in Zipbox bags

187
00:19:48.92 --> 00:19:54.68
because they expected it. And I'm like the one guy who's just lost. So my pens and my stuff were going

188
00:19:54.68 --> 00:19:58.20
everywhere. And of course, on the last one, trying to collect it all up. And so now I've got like

189
00:19:58.20 --> 00:20:02.36
five drill instructors circle in me. And I'm like fighting through their shins to get the rest of

190
00:20:02.36 --> 00:20:07.72
my stuff. And so I tell the story just to say, it was illustrated from day one that I was lost. And

191
00:20:07.72 --> 00:20:12.28
then, you know, they kind of kept coming hard at me. But my strength was like I said, athleticism

192
00:20:12.28 --> 00:20:18.52
and then relationships. So I was able to befriended all the guys around me, learn from them. And

193
00:20:18.52 --> 00:20:23.24
you know, I quickly went, we do peer evaluations there too. So like in the first peer evaluation,

194
00:20:23.24 --> 00:20:27.72
I was at the bottom because I was lost. But by the third one, I was like in the top third, right?

195
00:20:27.72 --> 00:20:31.24
And so that meant a lot to me. So I was able to demonstrate to my peers over the period of

196
00:20:31.24 --> 00:20:36.52
instruction that like, hey, there might be more of this guy than the lost little puppy we saw on day one.

197
00:20:36.52 --> 00:20:40.28
And so that was kind of the story of my whole entry level training. I mean, I was like,

198
00:20:40.28 --> 00:20:43.88
do they get rid of guys that are consistently at the bottom of the peer evaluations?

199
00:20:43.88 --> 00:20:49.08
They do. So the way it works is they do a board system. And so there's three boards through

200
00:20:49.08 --> 00:20:53.48
OCS. And if you get essentially counseling, so if you're at the bottom, they're going to give you

201
00:20:53.48 --> 00:20:57.16
counseling. And once you get a collection of them that you sit in front of the kernel and have to just

202
00:20:57.16 --> 00:21:03.08
a fire where you're there. And he's ultimately the one that decides to cut you or not. And then also at OCS,

203
00:21:03.08 --> 00:21:08.68
you can quit. You can drop on request. And so it's actually pretty high attrition. So we started with

204
00:21:08.68 --> 00:21:16.20
65, and I think we got down like 38. So I mean, but most of it is people that probably shouldn't be there anyway,

205
00:21:16.20 --> 00:21:22.76
quite honestly. There are some some very talented guys that I had one guy that made it to the last day.

206
00:21:22.76 --> 00:21:26.84
The day before graduation, this guy graduated from the University of Chicago with a mathematics

207
00:21:26.84 --> 00:21:30.60
degree. And I remember I'm very clearly because his last name was Sullivan and my name was Scheller.

208
00:21:30.60 --> 00:21:34.28
So I'm standing right next to him in the racks the whole time in the day before he just like,

209
00:21:34.28 --> 00:21:38.44
I don't want to commission. And I was like, too, we just went through like 10 weeks of the crisis.

210
00:21:38.44 --> 00:21:44.04
And I was like, and he said, I just wanted to see if I could do it. So that's like the type of guy that you want,

211
00:21:44.04 --> 00:21:48.76
you know. And so I was just blown away by that. And so then this guy made it like he had graduated

212
00:21:48.76 --> 00:21:54.76
for all extensive purposes and just decided now. And so there are some that go through all that.

213
00:21:54.76 --> 00:21:59.32
And then wave off. But the vast majority that I saw get a treat it out,

214
00:21:59.32 --> 00:22:03.96
probably need to be a treat it out. And then you go roll from right from there to the basics school.

215
00:22:03.96 --> 00:22:10.28
That's right. And how how how was that? Six months. So what they do is they just give you a baseline of

216
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.28
infantry leadership skills. They say it's not screening. Technically they're only supposed to screen

217
00:22:16.28 --> 00:22:21.40
at OCS. Yeah, give you my later my career. I worked as an instructor at OCS and TBS. And so I

218
00:22:21.40 --> 00:22:27.16
understand like behind the scenes of these two places in Tmoly now too. But TBS is for all the open

219
00:22:27.16 --> 00:22:31.24
ground contracts like myself where they ultimately determine what your MOS is going to be your

220
00:22:31.24 --> 00:22:36.12
military occupational specialty. So it's a very critical spot in terms of if you want to do something

221
00:22:36.12 --> 00:22:41.24
specific you got to distinguish yourself to be able to get that thing. And you learn a lot.

222
00:22:41.24 --> 00:22:46.20
It's more of a college atmosphere unlike OCS, Officer Candice Corps, Infantry Officer

223
00:22:46.20 --> 00:22:51.80
Corps, which is like all fieldwork. TBS is like a lot of classroom work. You do some field exercises

224
00:22:51.80 --> 00:22:56.36
just to kind of have a baseline of tactical knowledge. But it's a lot of classroom stuff.

225
00:22:56.36 --> 00:23:02.20
You said open ground. What is that? Open ground contract. So when you come in you either come in

226
00:23:02.20 --> 00:23:10.12
as a law contract and air contract law like jag. Yes. Okay. Yep. So law, air or ground. Those are

227
00:23:10.12 --> 00:23:16.12
the three. And so. Yeah. Bottom line is when you're at TBS they can't manipulate the law or air

228
00:23:16.12 --> 00:23:20.60
contracts. Those are already prewritten. But everybody else they determine their military

229
00:23:20.60 --> 00:23:27.64
occupational specialty at TBS. And how did you perform in TBS overall? I was the same thing.

230
00:23:27.64 --> 00:23:33.56
I showed up. I was lost. Quick story on that. So there's a transition where you go from

231
00:23:33.56 --> 00:23:38.12
sleeves down to sleeves up in the Marine Corps. You know, lost Lieutenant Schiller didn't know that.

232
00:23:38.12 --> 00:23:42.44
No one explained it to me. OCS. And so we show up. And so the transition happened to be just

233
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:48.28
between the 10 days we had between OCS and TBS. So I show up to check in and I'm the only one

234
00:23:48.28 --> 00:23:52.28
with my sleeves down. And everyone's like, what did you ever sleeves up? What am I like?

235
00:23:52.28 --> 00:23:57.32
Oh, yeah. So that again day one. I'm the one that doesn't know anything. And it was the same thing

236
00:23:57.32 --> 00:24:03.96
period of hours. You know, I had to like work my way up and I did. And I was academically probably

237
00:24:03.96 --> 00:24:09.000
in the bottom third just because all the tests. It was just rogue memorization. And I tried to

238
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.08
memorize it. A lot of guys had been in the Marine Corps before. It was just a little bit easier

239
00:24:13.08 --> 00:24:19.16
because they knew the knowledge inherently. But what got me up was like leadership evaluations

240
00:24:19.16 --> 00:24:22.04
are weighted pretty heavily. And I always did really good on the leadership evaluations.

241
00:24:22.04 --> 00:24:25.16
How does that work? Was it like you're in a field problem? Someone who's watching you and

242
00:24:25.16 --> 00:24:29.88
evaluate and how you're doing? Yeah. So the grade breakdown at TBS is 40% leadership,

243
00:24:29.88 --> 00:24:35.56
30% academic and 30% physical. And the leadership is built upon different exercises where

244
00:24:35.56 --> 00:24:41.24
you're evaluated by your instructor. So it's fed by things that you do, but still ultimately

245
00:24:41.24 --> 00:24:45.96
it's subjective. And even in the leadership score, what they do is so if a Platoon Commander

246
00:24:45.96 --> 00:24:50.84
has like 50 guys, they have to rank you one through 50. So they can't give everybody hundreds.

247
00:24:50.84 --> 00:24:55.32
So to make it fair, there's actually an algorithm where they have to stick it in. And so that's

248
00:24:55.32 --> 00:25:02.76
how you get a leadership grade. What's a is it just a typical sort of battle field problem that

249
00:25:02.76 --> 00:25:07.80
they're putting you on? You run an ambush? Are you running a patrol? Or is it like, what's it like?

250
00:25:07.80 --> 00:25:11.96
What are they grade new on? Yep. So some of them are leadership reaction courses where it's like a

251
00:25:11.96 --> 00:25:17.08
complex. It's not complex, but there's a problem that you have to solve. And typically they're

252
00:25:17.08 --> 00:25:22.36
not solvable, but they're determining how you navigate the situation that's not solvable.

253
00:25:22.92 --> 00:25:26.20
There's situations where you just, you're the patrol leader. Hey, take your squad and go

254
00:25:26.20 --> 00:25:31.48
attack this fire team on this hill and they'll evaluate you based on that, right? There's

255
00:25:31.48 --> 00:25:37.96
peer evaluations feed into it. So there's quite a few, probably about five or six different things

256
00:25:37.96 --> 00:25:43.56
that you do. Mostly, I think the probably the heaviest way is the in the tree line, you're a squad leader.

257
00:25:43.56 --> 00:25:47.88
So typically comes down to your squad leader, you're doing next to, you're doing next to one,

258
00:25:47.88 --> 00:25:52.28
which stands for field exercise. So they have all these field exercises and they just make you a leader of

259
00:25:52.28 --> 00:25:56.84
whatever, you're doing the defense, build the defense order and brief it and that's going to be a

260
00:25:56.84 --> 00:26:01.24
big part of your leadership grade. Are you guys shooting blanks at each other? Yeah, we are.

261
00:26:01.24 --> 00:26:06.28
Are you using miles gear or some equivalent or some? We have miles. It's now called it it's actually

262
00:26:06.28 --> 00:26:11.08
it has two now, same thing, but it doesn't work very well in the tree line. What it does do those,

263
00:26:11.08 --> 00:26:15.72
it provides graphical overlay. So if you're wanting a debriefet, like you can show, hey,

264
00:26:15.72 --> 00:26:20.12
there is the LPOP, there was the support by fire. So quite honestly, when we use it, it's more

265
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:24.36
for after action purposes. It doesn't, it just doesn't work very well in the tree line. So blanks

266
00:26:24.36 --> 00:26:29.16
is we found to be better. And then what did you, what, so where did you graduate in the class?

267
00:26:29.16 --> 00:26:34.92
When you came time to graduate? So the way TBS works is they put it into thirds and so they do that,

268
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:41.40
so that one MOS isn't overloaded with all the talent. So if you're in the top there, you get your first pick.

269
00:26:41.40 --> 00:26:45.40
If you're in the top of the second, the second pick. If you're in the top of the third,

270
00:26:45.40 --> 00:26:49.64
you get the third pick. So if you came this thing of everyone wanting to be like the top of the third

271
00:26:49.64 --> 00:26:56.28
third, then you're like, you're playing the numbers game. Like I said, I started in the bottom third,

272
00:26:56.28 --> 00:27:01.40
and I was like, but because of my leadership grades, I moved up to, I think, the top of the second third,

273
00:27:01.40 --> 00:27:04.60
the thing is where I ended up. And then you get their pick. So what'd you pick?

274
00:27:05.88 --> 00:27:13.000
I actually, I wanted to be infantry and at OCS, I said to my drill instructor, I wanted to be an infantry officer.

275
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.16
In fact, when I was going through the recruiting pipeline, I also even told me that the guy

276
00:27:17.16 --> 00:27:20.84
does my recruiting is like, I got an air contract and I was like, no, I want to be on the ground with the gun.

277
00:27:20.84 --> 00:27:24.04
You know, watching the TV, Marines, Flushos, I got one of the underground with the gun,

278
00:27:24.04 --> 00:27:27.40
and the leader. So at OCS, then I told him, I was like, I want to be an infantry officer,

279
00:27:27.40 --> 00:27:32.44
and they just were like, and very tri-off, so shell-eyed, you know, and what kind of like,

280
00:27:32.44 --> 00:27:36.44
why were they freaking out about that? I think it's just all part of the show.

281
00:27:36.44 --> 00:27:39.16
It's a song and dance, right? They just want to kind of knock you down.

282
00:27:39.16 --> 00:27:44.84
I'm, in fact, some of them are still friends with me, but at the time, you just don't really fully

283
00:27:44.84 --> 00:27:49.16
appreciate it. And so, those were kind of still bouncing around in my head. So when I got to TVS,

284
00:27:49.16 --> 00:27:55.000
I actually had infantry number three. So I put combat engineer and intel officer above it,

285
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.44
one, two, and three. And my, they call them SBC staff, we'll take commander, he's a captain,

286
00:28:00.44 --> 00:28:02.68
he was a infantry officer, and he just looked at me and he was like, shillard,

287
00:28:02.68 --> 00:28:06.60
you're going to be a fucking infantry officer. That's, but, and I thought it was joking. I was like,

288
00:28:06.60 --> 00:28:10.60
all right. Yeah. And then the game time resliction, I was waiting for him to be like,

289
00:28:10.60 --> 00:28:14.28
you know, intel officer, combat engineer and take infantry officer. And I was like,

290
00:28:14.28 --> 00:28:17.72
size them up like you joke in and he's like, no, I told you you're going to be never

291
00:28:17.72 --> 00:28:23.32
chopster. And, you know, looking back, there is no way I would have made it as long as I did,

292
00:28:23.32 --> 00:28:26.76
had I had any intel officer. Other than infantry officer, I just didn't know what I did know

293
00:28:26.76 --> 00:28:32.44
then. I mean, it's by far probably the best choice. And so, in a lot of ways, like I shaped my

294
00:28:32.44 --> 00:28:37.48
life and career. And I was really, really grateful to do that. So then you get infantry,

295
00:28:37.48 --> 00:28:41.56
doesn't it's often infantry officer school? That's right. And how long is that school? Three months.

296
00:28:41.56 --> 00:28:47.88
And how was that? When it was it? So I went through OCS, January to March of the five TBS,

297
00:28:47.88 --> 00:28:53.40
April to September of five, and IOC, September to December of five. So it was rapid fire. There

298
00:28:53.40 --> 00:28:57.08
a lot of times there's because based on when schools pick up, people will have two or three

299
00:28:57.08 --> 00:29:02.60
months breaks. But for me, you just worked out where in 11 months from showing up to OCS,

300
00:29:02.60 --> 00:29:06.84
I was standing in front of my potatoes. So by mid December, I was there. And you must have been

301
00:29:06.84 --> 00:29:12.60
getting guys that were coming fresh back from actually coming back from Feluzia that you watched

302
00:29:12.60 --> 00:29:16.84
on TV that were your instructors. It's better than that when I showed up to one eight, one eight

303
00:29:16.84 --> 00:29:21.24
was the center battalion of that attack that I watched on the TV. And the first speech I gave

304
00:29:21.24 --> 00:29:25.32
my potatoes like, hey, I'm your new Platoon Commander, half of them were in sweats. And so I

305
00:29:25.32 --> 00:29:27.96
took my Platoon Sergeant aside after the fact, I was like, hey, what? Why aren't they in the

306
00:29:27.96 --> 00:29:31.96
proper uniform? Because, sure, they all have doctors notes because they all have a trap and I'll

307
00:29:31.96 --> 00:29:35.16
still in their body from the push through Feluzia. And that was like the moment for me, or was like,

308
00:29:35.16 --> 00:29:40.04
oh my god, like this is real. And it's just like the way the world hits you of the

309
00:29:40.04 --> 00:29:45.96
responsibility. So yes, it was very real when I showed up to my units. How was infrastructure

310
00:29:45.96 --> 00:29:51.32
off your school? That is probably one of the best schools, Barnan. I mean, they really do a

311
00:29:51.32 --> 00:29:57.08
good job of preparing you. And I mean, there are just three months of intense

312
00:29:57.08 --> 00:30:02.28
intense infantry training. And I really felt prepared, shown up from my putin. I mean,

313
00:30:02.28 --> 00:30:07.08
the, the Marine Corps does a great job of putting a product in for the Platoon in terms of officers.

314
00:30:07.08 --> 00:30:11.16
Now, are you going to get some that slip through the cracks? Absolutely. There is no perfect

315
00:30:11.16 --> 00:30:15.40
system, but I'll say holistically from a guy that just wanted to learn and wanted to be a leader.

316
00:30:15.40 --> 00:30:19.56
They did a really good job of preparing me. Sure, they set up. Are you an upatoon in your

317
00:30:19.56 --> 00:30:23.80
basically taking turns as leaders going out and running operations? That's right. The whole time.

318
00:30:23.80 --> 00:30:30.20
The whole time. It's an an infantry officer, of course. It's a lot more current TTPs as well.

319
00:30:30.20 --> 00:30:34.28
Whereas the basic school is the fundamentals in green side of building the defense,

320
00:30:34.28 --> 00:30:39.24
very conventional type stuff. The timeless principles, whereas infantry officer, of course,

321
00:30:39.24 --> 00:30:45.72
is like this is the new RCO. This is the IED that's in Ramadi right now. So on and so forth. This is

322
00:30:45.72 --> 00:30:51.08
how we do patrol and 5 and 25s right now. And so there's still a lot of timeless stuff that

323
00:30:51.08 --> 00:30:56.36
goes on in IOC, but it was really nice to get a lot of current TTPs coming through that schoolhouse.

324
00:30:56.36 --> 00:31:01.000
And then the instructors too, at IOC, if you're a captain and you're in a instructor there,

325
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.84
your hands selected and most of those guys go on to become generals, quite honestly.

326
00:31:04.84 --> 00:31:09.40
So you get the Kremlin terms of young captains that have just come off their first tour,

327
00:31:09.40 --> 00:31:13.96
like the Marine Corps picks the best. To go to TBS and then from TBS they pick the best at a TBS

328
00:31:13.96 --> 00:31:19.000
to go to IOC. And so you really just get great instructors. Like I had Brian Shantosh,

329
00:31:19.56 --> 00:31:24.68
who was Silverstar, I had Marcus Mines, who he got relieved recently as a tank manner,

330
00:31:24.68 --> 00:31:31.96
but in terms of like deep thinker, warfighter, like there was no better. I just had a group.

331
00:31:31.96 --> 00:31:36.52
It's quite funny when you look at my instructors. A lot of them burnt out, like the Shantoshes

332
00:31:36.52 --> 00:31:41.96
in the mines, but I don't think I've ever ran into a group of officers that maybe were

333
00:31:41.96 --> 00:31:47.24
more outside the box thinkers and warfighters than that instructor cadre that I had there.

334
00:31:47.24 --> 00:31:51.48
When you look back at that time, is there any lessons that stand out to you? Like, oh yeah,

335
00:31:51.48 --> 00:32:01.64
that operation left the huge impact on me. I think just the mental toughness that the

336
00:32:01.64 --> 00:32:08.28
instructors have pressed upon me every single day is what I left with. I mean, I walked away

337
00:32:08.28 --> 00:32:13.96
with an impression that these infantry officers are the real deal, they're warfighters,

338
00:32:13.96 --> 00:32:20.36
and they know they're trade. Like it was very clear to me that I had to step up my game and I

339
00:32:20.36 --> 00:32:27.000
couldn't fake the funk because people could see right through it. I think the TTPs always change,

340
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.40
but the thirst for going and opening the pub and making sure that you knew more than everyone else,

341
00:32:33.40 --> 00:32:38.68
making sure that in those tough situations, you were the guy they were looking to to have

342
00:32:38.68 --> 00:32:43.88
the direction to have that mental toughness that they might need. You guys doing live fire,

343
00:32:43.88 --> 00:32:48.92
blanks both? Mostly live fire. I also see as mostly live fire. Obviously you're not shooting

344
00:32:48.92 --> 00:32:54.12
live fire each other. So in the situations where we did for some force, it was blanks, but it was

345
00:32:54.12 --> 00:32:59.56
a ton of live fire. Did you learn anything about like the amount of pressure that you were going

346
00:32:59.56 --> 00:33:04.60
to face? Did they do a good job of simulating the pressure you're going to face in combat situations?

347
00:33:04.60 --> 00:33:09.80
Yeah, I mean, that was the whole stick. I mean, there was even a couple of times where it may

348
00:33:09.80 --> 00:33:14.28
be even swung too far to the other direction because I remember one time we were getting close to

349
00:33:14.28 --> 00:33:20.84
graduating and we had gone from the desert of Mojave up to the mountains of Bridgeport and then

350
00:33:20.84 --> 00:33:26.36
we were coming off the mountains of Bridgeport and they stopped at some like Rinky Dink casino.

351
00:33:26.36 --> 00:33:29.96
Just let us get drunk. It was like in a middle nowhere. We're probably knowing when we'd

352
00:33:29.96 --> 00:33:35.40
get in trouble because it was literally in the middle nowhere. Well, the director, this guy is

353
00:33:35.40 --> 00:33:41.000
still in the Marine Corps, the regimental commander, or probably moved on by now. But he got,

354
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.76
so he was the major and he just got hammered drunk and started screaming at the lieutenant so

355
00:33:46.76 --> 00:33:51.88
that they weren't ready for combat, right? And I was like one of the few times where like,

356
00:33:51.88 --> 00:33:55.40
you know, I'm still young and the curtain had been peeled back, but I remember thinking like,

357
00:33:55.40 --> 00:33:58.52
I get it. You got more experiences than me, but I'm about to knock you the fuck out.

358
00:33:58.52 --> 00:34:01.24
Like, you know, to mean Lieutenant the major, like you don't talk to me like that.

359
00:34:01.96 --> 00:34:07.40
And so yes, they did a very good job of preparing us, but sometimes I felt like

360
00:34:07.40 --> 00:34:12.44
almost to the point where it was, you got a little on professional times. You know, there's a line

361
00:34:12.44 --> 00:34:17.08
on how you treat a man. I'll rise to the occasion when given the opportunity, but I don't want to be

362
00:34:17.08 --> 00:34:24.52
denigrated. And then from there, it's bad. It's serious. That's when you went to one eight.

363
00:34:24.52 --> 00:34:29.08
That's right. Yep. So in fact, most of the guys, because we graduated right before Christmas,

364
00:34:29.08 --> 00:34:33.88
most of my fellow students took Christmas break and then showed up in January. One eight was deploying

365
00:34:33.88 --> 00:34:38.76
so fast that the batinax, so I actually came up, diocy took me and my six peers that were going

366
00:34:38.76 --> 00:34:43.56
to one eight and said, I need you now. We're going to AP Hill right after Christmas, and I want you

367
00:34:43.56 --> 00:34:47.88
checked in with all your gear, meet your potions, and then you can take, you know, week for Christmas,

368
00:34:47.88 --> 00:34:50.36
and you're going to show up and go to AP Hill with us, and so that's what we did.

369
00:34:51.56 --> 00:34:54.60
And you already talked about meat and your potion for the first time. Yeah.

370
00:34:55.24 --> 00:35:00.68
Yeah, so there was that. And I went into the, you know, I didn't have a house. So my personal life,

371
00:35:00.68 --> 00:35:06.44
I was dating my, my girlfriend at the time, and I had gotten engaged. I got engaged that

372
00:35:06.44 --> 00:35:11.72
Christmas. That week that I had off, actually. I take that back. I got engaged before I went to

373
00:35:11.72 --> 00:35:18.20
ACS. So when I, she was working in Richmond, when I went down to one eight, she stayed in Richmond.

374
00:35:18.20 --> 00:35:22.76
And so I was living in like this shitty apartment. Maybe because that new I was going to

375
00:35:22.76 --> 00:35:27.56
deploy in six months. My plan all along was to just do the first tour and then go up to Richmond

376
00:35:27.56 --> 00:35:33.48
and get out and be with my wife. We got married in between TBS and IOC. In fact,

377
00:35:33.48 --> 00:35:37.64
Marcus minds that guy was telling you about those such a good instructor. The IOC,

378
00:35:37.64 --> 00:35:41.88
they call it combat endurance test. This is like their screening event. It's like a two

379
00:35:41.88 --> 00:35:46.36
thirds of a marathon. It's like 16 miles. And they got like little stations like 84,

380
00:35:46.36 --> 00:35:52.12
do the 84 radio, do the radio. And then about 10 miles in, one of the stations is ground fighting.

381
00:35:52.12 --> 00:35:57.64
Marcus minds was a college wrestler. And so, you know, you were just exhausted at this point.

382
00:35:57.64 --> 00:36:02.76
And this guy gets to just beat up on tired little to tennis, right? Like, good job dude.

383
00:36:02.76 --> 00:36:08.04
So that's what he does. And I know I'm trying everything I can to fight him. And I thought I

384
00:36:08.04 --> 00:36:10.60
was doing pretty good. And I think because I was doing pretty good, he started getting a little bit

385
00:36:10.60 --> 00:36:16.44
more violent. And he elbowed me in the eye and gave me a black eye. And I got married that week.

386
00:36:16.44 --> 00:36:22.44
So when all my wedding pictures and I was black eyes, listening there. So yeah, one eight. Sorry. So

387
00:36:22.44 --> 00:36:27.48
AP Hill in January to March. And then we actually, we went on deployment in June of 06.

388
00:36:27.48 --> 00:36:32.76
And where was that deployment too? So at that time, everyone was going to Iraq. So that's

389
00:36:32.76 --> 00:36:37.000
all we trained for. That marked that January to June was like, we're going to Iraq. There was

390
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.88
middle question about it. But we're not going to fly there. We're going to get on what we call a

391
00:36:41.88 --> 00:36:46.76
mu marine expeditionary unit. You get on three Navy ships and you sail over there. Back in that

392
00:36:46.76 --> 00:36:53.16
day in 06, it was a, it was a much bigger footprint. Back then, the naval group had a submarine.

393
00:36:53.16 --> 00:36:58.20
They had destroyers. I mean, it was a whole entourage back then. But over time, it just

394
00:36:58.20 --> 00:37:05.88
Navy's degradation. It's now just the three ships. So we got on the ships. We sailed across the Atlantic.

395
00:37:05.88 --> 00:37:10.44
We went through the Suez, which is like a million a ship. So that would just fiscally,

396
00:37:10.44 --> 00:37:14.76
you know once you cross the Suez and you're in St. Com, like, game on. But when that happened,

397
00:37:15.72 --> 00:37:21.000
Israel and Lebanon got into a conflict. This was in like June or July of 06. And so they actually

398
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.76
turned us around and it's back to the Suez. And then we did a neo non-combatant evacuation operation.

399
00:37:26.76 --> 00:37:31.16
And we took American citizens out of Bay Route. We sent up a tune in there to secure the embassy.

400
00:37:31.16 --> 00:37:35.32
And then we took them to Cyprus. And then we sat there and stared at Bay Route for like six weeks.

401
00:37:35.32 --> 00:37:39.88
Like I just did pushups every morning like there at Bay Route. Awesome. You know, and all I wanted to

402
00:37:39.88 --> 00:37:45.56
do is go to Iraq. And so then after like two months of just staring at Bay Route, we went back

403
00:37:45.56 --> 00:37:51.80
across the Suez. Got into Kuwait. And they ended up saying, you don't have the legs for the deployment.

404
00:37:51.80 --> 00:37:56.44
Because when you put people on a deployment, there's like, yes, cut off. And to extend that would have

405
00:37:56.44 --> 00:38:00.60
caused more trouble than it was worth. They did take our sniper opportunity out of that

406
00:38:00.60 --> 00:38:05.32
batai and sent them up north because it was six. It was such a sniper fight. And we actually had

407
00:38:05.32 --> 00:38:09.40
unfortunately a couple snipers over kill. So we ended up coming back from the deployment and had

408
00:38:09.40 --> 00:38:14.20
a memorial for these snipers. And it was so weird because most of us hadn't even gotten into Iraq.

409
00:38:14.20 --> 00:38:18.68
And then we're at this memorial. But that was, that was the first deployment.

410
00:38:20.44 --> 00:38:25.24
And then you serve then you roll right into another workup. That's right. So I mean, we went.

411
00:38:25.24 --> 00:38:32.92
So we got back in December. And we deployed to Ramani Bay September. So like six, seven months later.

412
00:38:32.92 --> 00:38:37.40
And this is kind of, this is a longer story. So I'm going all of it. But I haven't

413
00:38:37.40 --> 00:38:43.24
going to go to Winter Mountain Leaders course from January to March. And then I got back. We went to

414
00:38:43.24 --> 00:38:49.80
Fort Pickett Hall of April. So I mean, I was only home. And then we ended up going to Mojaveviper.

415
00:38:49.80 --> 00:38:54.36
It was what it was called back then, which was a two month deal. I mean, I was only home probably

416
00:38:54.36 --> 00:39:00.44
for about six weeks. And I and I my wife quit her job to come down and live with me in between that.

417
00:39:00.44 --> 00:39:04.44
And so we had bought a house. And it was like, yeah, I guess I'll see you after the next deployment.

418
00:39:04.44 --> 00:39:09.64
Because I am just not home, right? And so I'll skip forward the reason I didn't get out after the

419
00:39:09.64 --> 00:39:15.16
second deployment. It's just that she quit her job and had came down. And then when I was in

420
00:39:15.16 --> 00:39:19.16
Iraq and all of just worn out, and she's like, what are you going to do? I said, I'm going to get out.

421
00:39:19.16 --> 00:39:22.44
Like, that's a punch. Like, well, what's the plan after them? I don't know. We'll figure that out.

422
00:39:22.44 --> 00:39:27.32
She's like, we just bought a house. Please take a non-depoiable. So we can free this out. But

423
00:39:28.04 --> 00:39:34.20
so yeah, personal life was, was tough at that time. So when you came home from that deployment,

424
00:39:34.20 --> 00:39:39.24
where you went to Lebanon, you get back from that. And you immediately go into work up. But on top of

425
00:39:39.24 --> 00:39:44.12
the work up, you go to mountain leader school. You're just gone the whole time. Your wife, who had

426
00:39:44.12 --> 00:39:49.40
cleared jobs. Now sitting in the house filled with boxes that you never unpacked because you're a bad

427
00:39:49.40 --> 00:39:54.36
husband. I'm promised I would paint the house. I'd have painted this. I've done this drill before.

428
00:39:55.16 --> 00:40:00.52
I've definitely done that drill before. I moved to Virginia Beach. And I was there for two years.

429
00:40:00.52 --> 00:40:06.12
And in that time, I did two deployments and to work up. So my wife, we never even took some stuff out of

430
00:40:06.12 --> 00:40:11.64
the boxes in the house that we bought. So yeah, I did that drill. The bathroom never got painted.

431
00:40:12.44 --> 00:40:15.88
Neither did anything else until until when until we're getting ready to sell the house.

432
00:40:15.88 --> 00:40:20.68
Then I got a bunch of stuff done. I can beat that. I've done moved to move where the stuff was

433
00:40:20.68 --> 00:40:25.08
still in the boxes from the last move. And the movers are like, well, we need you to take it out of the

434
00:40:25.08 --> 00:40:28.68
boxes because we can't use other people's boxes. I'm like, you want me to take all my stuff out of the

435
00:40:28.68 --> 00:40:33.16
boxes for you to put in new boxes. So yeah, I bet that. There's a mountain leaders course up at

436
00:40:33.16 --> 00:40:37.96
Bridgeport. It is. Yeah. And how was that? It was awesome. So I didn't want to go just because my wife

437
00:40:37.96 --> 00:40:43.08
had quit a job and came down and that had limited time. And it was this whole thing where I put my

438
00:40:43.08 --> 00:40:46.28
name in the hat because I didn't know my wife was quitting. So on the first deployment of my

439
00:40:46.28 --> 00:40:50.52
name in the hat, when I came back, they're like, you're not going. And then at the last second,

440
00:40:50.52 --> 00:40:54.04
like, after my wife quit, and I probably should have moved all our stuff out. They're like, okay,

441
00:40:54.04 --> 00:40:57.32
you're going. I'm like, what? You know, I was like flipping tables. How long is that course?

442
00:40:57.32 --> 00:41:02.76
It was three months. And so it is very challenging because it's so cold.

443
00:41:03.48 --> 00:41:08.20
Some mentally, it really takes a toll. But I have a good skier. I grew up skiing and ski resorts

444
00:41:08.20 --> 00:41:12.12
around the Midwest. And so that was fun. And back then, they probably don't do this anymore.

445
00:41:12.12 --> 00:41:17.72
Back then, for weekends, they gave us a 16 passenger van and let us as the students have it.

446
00:41:17.72 --> 00:41:22.52
So we had a gunny who didn't drink. And he just drove us to Tahoe or, you know, every week.

447
00:41:22.52 --> 00:41:26.68
I mean, it was some of the fun of the weekend that I've ever had. The last time I came to San Diego,

448
00:41:26.68 --> 00:41:32.12
was on that bridge portrait. So me and my buddy took a flight to San Diego. And I had a guy who had

449
00:41:32.12 --> 00:41:38.36
an apartment in the gas lamp district in, uh, maybe a good time. Yeah. And then you're, you go into

450
00:41:38.36 --> 00:41:41.40
employment. And now you're working up. You do you know you're going to Iraq this time? Yeah,

451
00:41:41.40 --> 00:41:44.12
we do. I know you're going straight to Iraq out, taking a ship. That's right.

452
00:41:45.32 --> 00:41:51.000
And, but this is now 2007. But your work up is in 2006.

453
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.52
Uh, no, the work up, the work up was January to July of 2007. Okay. But still, do you know where

454
00:41:58.52 --> 00:42:02.84
you're going? Do you know you're going to Ramadi the whole time? Yes. And so at that time,

455
00:42:02.84 --> 00:42:06.52
still 2007, you started to work up. Ramadi is still pretty freaking hot at that point.

456
00:42:06.52 --> 00:42:12.92
Ramadi was very hot in January, 2007. And then there was a thing called the L. Ambar Awakening.

457
00:42:13.48 --> 00:42:18.92
And so it was almost like the sharp pivot like right as we were getting there. And so the unit that we

458
00:42:18.92 --> 00:42:24.44
ripped with two five, I mean, they had just, it was like gunfight, gunfight, gunfight, and then

459
00:42:24.44 --> 00:42:29.48
it will last two months of their deployment. And almost like somebody just hit stop. And so it

460
00:42:29.48 --> 00:42:34.44
created a lot of weirdness for us because it was like, we were still operating under TTPs where

461
00:42:34.44 --> 00:42:38.28
it was like gunfight, gunfight, gunfight, gunfight, and it just, it really wasn't that by the time

462
00:42:38.28 --> 00:42:44.84
we showed up. So where were you? Where in Ramadi were you? So I was a company XO now. And we,

463
00:42:44.84 --> 00:42:55.32
I was on the south west corner, I started a place called JSS Iron. And we had like two

464
00:42:55.32 --> 00:43:00.92
platoon outposts. So as a company XO, I was consolidating the patrol rosters and like the

465
00:43:00.92 --> 00:43:04.84
name of the game then was always have patrols in the battle space. Like, what are we doing?

466
00:43:04.84 --> 00:43:09.80
I just get them out there, right? So it was just like just saturate the battle space with presence.

467
00:43:09.80 --> 00:43:15.32
And so as XO, a lot of my role was just making sure that we had good perimeter security of our

468
00:43:15.32 --> 00:43:19.64
positions, that we had all our gear and that the operational plan, I was like the

469
00:43:19.64 --> 00:43:26.20
absolute, if you will, at the company level. And then about three months into the deployment,

470
00:43:26.20 --> 00:43:31.56
they moved us because we were at that time trying to move out of the city to further outpost

471
00:43:31.56 --> 00:43:38.20
to allow the Iraqi police to have more control. And so we basically built a fob in the ground up,

472
00:43:38.20 --> 00:43:43.32
it was called JSS Sua. And this was all the way in the southwest out of the city now.

473
00:43:44.20 --> 00:43:49.40
And it was called Sua because it was literally, I think, built by a sewer. And there was nothing

474
00:43:49.40 --> 00:43:55.56
there. And you know, even though we had been in Iraq since what O3, it was like we had never been

475
00:43:55.56 --> 00:44:00.28
in our Iraq before. So it was like baby web showers, no childhood. I mean it was awful. It was bad.

476
00:44:00.84 --> 00:44:03.80
And so we did that. We finished the deployment there.

477
00:44:03.80 --> 00:44:09.000
And what was the, I know things had settled down a lot when you had patrols out in the city,

478
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.32
were they taking any contact? Or was it? Yeah, we had one pull to and they got in some context.

479
00:44:13.32 --> 00:44:18.92
Did the, the problem then, it was almost, I don't know, I don't want to say more dangerous,

480
00:44:18.92 --> 00:44:25.64
but it was like you'd get lald into a false sense of stability. And then there'd be a suicide

481
00:44:25.64 --> 00:44:31.40
best attack. And you lose guys. And so my best friend, so I did the first deployment in

482
00:44:31.40 --> 00:44:35.08
Bravo Company. I was a particular commander. So when we got back, I was still a particular

483
00:44:35.08 --> 00:44:39.64
and Bravo Company. They moved me over to Alpha Company to be the XO. So I still had a lot of good

484
00:44:39.64 --> 00:44:42.92
friends that were particular commanders in Bravo Company. One of them, it's guys' name was Dave

485
00:44:42.92 --> 00:44:47.56
Warden. He used to, we used to make dinner. He was a Pittsburgh dealer's fan. I was a Bengals fan.

486
00:44:47.56 --> 00:44:55.000
So we'd always have like rivalry games together with my wife. And he responded to a sniper threat.

487
00:44:55.64 --> 00:45:00.44
And Sua's side best came up to him, guy wearing Sua's side best, and detonated it and killed

488
00:45:00.44 --> 00:45:06.84
one of his Marines in Blue David, lost his leg. And so there's just an example of, you know,

489
00:45:06.84 --> 00:45:10.76
I'm sitting there for two months with like nothing happening. And then I got to listen on the

490
00:45:10.76 --> 00:45:18.36
radio to my buddy being evacuated out lost a Marine. And then, and so yeah, so we had one pollton

491
00:45:19.56 --> 00:45:24.68
that all got combat action ribbons from doing patrols and getting into fire fights, but they didn't

492
00:45:24.68 --> 00:45:30.52
really kill a lot of people. It was more, that deployment was more just about like census patrols

493
00:45:30.52 --> 00:45:37.64
stability, building shit, and trying not to get blown up. I mean, there was a, there was the adjacent

494
00:45:37.64 --> 00:45:42.84
batayan. I might get the units wrong. I hope I don't, I think it was 28 and one nine. And they were

495
00:45:42.84 --> 00:45:46.68
doing the rib towards end of our deployment. And this is still a story told in the Marine Corps

496
00:45:47.48 --> 00:45:51.48
while they were sitting at the ECP, a huge, so there's like two companies in there because they were

497
00:45:51.48 --> 00:45:57.000
doing the rib, a huge dump truck blew through the ECP with a bunch of explosives. And all of the

498
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.96
Iraqis ran in these two young Marines, Stan of the ECP from different units, didn't know each other,

499
00:46:01.96 --> 00:46:07.72
stood there and killed the driver and got themselves killed. And all the Iraqis were talking

500
00:46:07.72 --> 00:46:12.44
about how brave the Marines were. And then we, we almost believed that they were probably

501
00:46:12.44 --> 00:46:17.16
exaggerating that a little bit. And then after this huge explosion, one of the cameras, even though

502
00:46:17.16 --> 00:46:20.68
it looked like it was broken, still had the footage. And then went back and pulled the footage.

503
00:46:20.68 --> 00:46:25.000
And it was exactly like they said, these two young Marines, Stan of the ECP, knowing they were

504
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.48
going to die, not knowing each other. Like in that instant realized what was happening,

505
00:46:29.48 --> 00:46:33.72
saved everybody else on that base. So like that to me, that story almost describes what

506
00:46:33.72 --> 00:46:39.48
Romadi was when I was there. Like you can be standing on that ECP for seven months without a single

507
00:46:39.48 --> 00:46:43.64
thing. And then all of a sudden in a second, there's a dump truck flying at you and you know

508
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:53.24
you're about to die. And so for me, the ECP, so I was always, it was like, I'm not exaggerating.

509
00:46:53.24 --> 00:46:58.44
I was like 20 hour work days constantly. And you know, you go back and you're asking

510
00:46:58.44 --> 00:47:03.32
why were you working 20 hour work days? Like, I can't put my finger on exactly what it was.

511
00:47:03.32 --> 00:47:07.32
It just seemed like there was always something that required like a meaty detention. And the

512
00:47:07.32 --> 00:47:12.92
ISO container that I lived in was with my company commander and our one-trip. So it seemed like

513
00:47:12.92 --> 00:47:16.60
people were waking us up. Like somebody always needed one of the three of us. That was the

514
00:47:16.60 --> 00:47:20.84
stupidest move in hindsight, putting us three in the same sleeping facility. Like it was so dumb.

515
00:47:21.72 --> 00:47:29.08
And so like when I came home from Romadi, I mean I started having chest pains, like real chest

516
00:47:29.08 --> 00:47:33.80
physical chest pains. And I it took me a lot of kind of figure out that it was anxiety. And then I

517
00:47:33.80 --> 00:47:37.24
didn't experience anxiety during the deployments. Like when you're working 20 hour days and

518
00:47:37.24 --> 00:47:43.64
years ago go go and hit me like once I tried to chill out. But I tell that just to say,

519
00:47:44.44 --> 00:47:48.76
I think I kind of was going so fast that it just kind of freed some of the wires my brain there

520
00:47:48.76 --> 00:47:55.64
for a little bit and took some while to work through some of that. So you get home, you get home

521
00:47:55.64 --> 00:48:02.28
from that deployment and then what's next? Yeah, so I had to get forward the earlier. So I had

522
00:48:02.28 --> 00:48:06.92
planned on getting out. I didn't get along with my batained commander on that deployment. He was very

523
00:48:08.44 --> 00:48:14.20
dictator-ish almost like verbally mentally abusive. I just didn't care for him. I didn't,

524
00:48:14.20 --> 00:48:18.20
I don't know if I even agreed with the mission of Romadi. Like I said, I joined because I wanted to

525
00:48:18.20 --> 00:48:23.08
be in combat. But I found myself as my company commander would write the contracts. And as the

526
00:48:23.08 --> 00:48:28.52
exo, I was what was known as the pageant. I go to camp Romadi and they'd filled my book bag

527
00:48:28.52 --> 00:48:33.72
with like $200,000 cash and then run around and just give it to like these mafia figures.

528
00:48:33.72 --> 00:48:39.000
And I'm just thinking like, is this what we're doing? Like this just, I don't know if this counter

529
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.12
insurgency. Oh, this is what we're doing. I don't know if this counter insurgency, like because

530
00:48:44.12 --> 00:48:47.88
all the generals are talking about like how great it is. But like even as a young tenant, like I had a lot of

531
00:48:47.88 --> 00:48:52.92
questions. I was like, that was that was influential to me because I'm thinking like there's got to be a

532
00:48:52.92 --> 00:48:56.12
more effective way. Like these guys that I'm giving them money to right now. I don't know if anyone

533
00:48:56.12 --> 00:48:59.72
else sees this. But this guy is not going to build stability here. And I rack this guy's going to

534
00:48:59.72 --> 00:49:06.28
take it. And he might even make it worse for the local Iraqi. And so anyway, I left. I would thought

535
00:49:06.28 --> 00:49:12.28
about getting out, but my wife's very much wanted some stability. I thought like she deserved it.

536
00:49:12.28 --> 00:49:17.16
And so instead of getting out, I took school of infantry as a company commander. It was in North

537
00:49:17.16 --> 00:49:23.24
Carolina. I didn't have to move and the goal was to do three years there and find get to get a master's

538
00:49:23.24 --> 00:49:28.04
getting an MBA and then go on the next thing. And when I got to the school of infantry,

539
00:49:28.92 --> 00:49:33.96
I was very busy. I was go go go go. School of infantry is funny because right then it was Iraq

540
00:49:33.96 --> 00:49:40.12
and all my instructors were Iraq veterans and all their families are willing to put their

541
00:49:40.12 --> 00:49:45.40
problems on the shelf when you're at war. But it's like they had an expectation for their husband

542
00:49:45.40 --> 00:49:49.32
when he got home that they would address some of those problems. And then those point structures

543
00:49:49.32 --> 00:49:55.16
were working dark to dark and it was like every single one of them were going through a divorce. Like

544
00:49:55.16 --> 00:49:59.24
up to like my senior and list of like every single one like I was bringing in chaplains. I was

545
00:49:59.24 --> 00:50:03.88
bringing in workshops. And so the biggest struggle there was just the personalized of my guys. They all

546
00:50:03.88 --> 00:50:07.72
had drinking problems. They all had marriage problems. They were all working through their own

547
00:50:07.72 --> 00:50:13.56
demons and then trying to teach 300 privates how to be infantry men without losing their cool,

548
00:50:13.56 --> 00:50:19.80
you know, not flying off the handle. And so that was kind of a more emotionally draining than I thought

549
00:50:19.80 --> 00:50:26.20
it would be. And I did it for about a year and a half until I write it about then it was.

550
00:50:26.20 --> 00:50:32.12
So I was at SOS from O8 to 10. If you go back and look at the news around O809,

551
00:50:32.12 --> 00:50:35.48
the common of the Marine Corps, guy named Conway was saying he wanted to get the Marine

552
00:50:35.48 --> 00:50:39.24
Corps out of Iraq and into Afghanistan. So I was right when they were trying to do the pivot and I

553
00:50:39.24 --> 00:50:44.60
thought, hey, you know, my Ramadi deployment and it wasn't the combat that I thought it was going to be.

554
00:50:44.60 --> 00:50:50.60
It was very emotionally draining but it was, you know, I wasn't shooting a gun all the time. So I was like,

555
00:50:50.60 --> 00:50:54.84
I would love to get an Afghanistan and then maybe get out and just have that experience.

556
00:50:55.40 --> 00:51:00.20
And so I contacted my monitor and I found a deployment through an organization called joint

557
00:51:00.20 --> 00:51:05.64
IED defeat organization, Jai Doe. And they see he's like, there's a joint requirement for an

558
00:51:05.64 --> 00:51:09.72
infantry captain. He's like, this is perfect. It'll get you there. You'll get every all the combat

559
00:51:09.72 --> 00:51:14.44
experience that you want. And all you need is two years of SOS, not three. So after two, I can

560
00:51:14.44 --> 00:51:18.36
cut your orders if you get your commands endorsement. We can make this happen. So I went and

561
00:51:18.36 --> 00:51:24.36
talked to my boss and my boss didn't want me to do it. He was very reluctant. He wanted me to be the

562
00:51:24.36 --> 00:51:28.68
officer or the H&I company commander, which is like the senior builder. So they're like, he liked me.

563
00:51:28.68 --> 00:51:34.92
Were you instructing at all? Were you at the SOS? Or were you more just like, overall

564
00:51:34.92 --> 00:51:43.08
in management position? Yeah. So you get 300 privates. So SOS is in two camps. So there's MCT and

565
00:51:43.08 --> 00:51:49.96
ITB. So all marine and list of marines that are not infantry go to MCT. And they get, it's evolving

566
00:51:49.96 --> 00:51:55.88
now with the new force. But back then they got like two weeks of infantry training. And ITB

567
00:51:55.88 --> 00:51:59.88
you got one month. So it was essentially like your follow-in-school. So the guys at MCT, if you're

568
00:51:59.88 --> 00:52:04.12
going to go be a motor T driver, you'd MCT for two weeks and then you go to a motor T school.

569
00:52:04.12 --> 00:52:07.72
ITB, they just get longer training than their infantry marines and then they go onto their

570
00:52:07.72 --> 00:52:13.88
follow-in unit. And so again, it's changing now. I think it's up to like 10 weeks for ITB. But back then

571
00:52:13.88 --> 00:52:19.64
it was only four weeks. And so that's outstanding. Yeah, it is. It really is. And so they got,

572
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.48
so we would get 300 privates. And we would divide them into four platoons. The platoon commanders were

573
00:52:25.48 --> 00:52:30.60
either staff sergeants or sergeants. And then each platoon commander had two or three instructors.

574
00:52:30.60 --> 00:52:37.88
So you never had more than three to four for, I don't know, do the math, like 75 guys. So it's a lot.

575
00:52:37.88 --> 00:52:41.56
The instructor student ratio was not good. And there was no other officers. I had a first

576
00:52:41.56 --> 00:52:44.84
sergeant in a gunning and then there was the young captain. And that was the staff.

577
00:52:46.68 --> 00:52:51.000
So you're not doing a lot of instruction. You're not seeing a lot of what's going on.

578
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.08
There were most of the instruction comes from, they have a separate cadre of instructors at the

579
00:52:57.08 --> 00:53:02.44
instructor group. So it's almost like the staff that you have is almost like facilitating in the

580
00:53:02.44 --> 00:53:07.000
after hours and the watching and the day to day leadership. Now there's still a lot of classes

581
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.76
that we give out in the field or or once they get back to the house. And sometimes there's even

582
00:53:10.76 --> 00:53:14.44
like scheduled platform instruction. But most of the platform instruction comes from general

583
00:53:14.44 --> 00:53:19.96
support instructors. So the question was how much classes did I give? There were probably two or three

584
00:53:19.96 --> 00:53:24.60
program company commander classes. And the rest was just in prompt to hey, you're going on

585
00:53:24.60 --> 00:53:30.36
liberty this weekend under a committee commander. No control. No control. I was very lucky in my career.

586
00:53:30.36 --> 00:53:37.80
I wasn't instructor, which is a strong word to use when back in the day, back in the day we used

587
00:53:37.80 --> 00:53:43.40
to that's heel team. There was just instruct. There was there was training inside each heel team.

588
00:53:43.40 --> 00:53:48.44
So like as an E5, I was teaching a bunch of stuff and it really put me in a great position because

589
00:53:48.44 --> 00:53:51.32
in you're you're having to learn it better and then you're teaching it and then you're seeing

590
00:53:51.32 --> 00:53:55.96
how it works and seeing the mistakes that people made. So I've always felt like I learned a

591
00:53:55.96 --> 00:54:02.44
ton doing that and then later in my career when I was running training, which was our training

592
00:54:02.44 --> 00:54:10.28
was just freaking out standing. And but I got to again watch, observe, teach and I learned so much

593
00:54:10.28 --> 00:54:15.64
when I was in those positions. And that's what I wanted if you were, you know, kind of actively teaching

594
00:54:15.64 --> 00:54:21.08
and what you got out of that. You're 100% right. The people that learn the most are the teachers.

595
00:54:22.20 --> 00:54:26.52
And because you can't fake the funk when you're the teacher and you have to there's, you know,

596
00:54:26.52 --> 00:54:31.56
five, six, seven hours of prep for anyone hour of instruction that you get at a minimum. And so I

597
00:54:31.56 --> 00:54:36.28
100% of the grab work at a bunch of former school houses and we learn that abundantly. The people that

598
00:54:36.28 --> 00:54:44.20
teach are really the ones that learn in my opinion. Yeah, I think I learned 70% of what I ever learned

599
00:54:44.20 --> 00:54:51.72
in my life while I was in E5 instructor, cadre at COT 1. Yeah, because I taught, that's the

600
00:54:51.72 --> 00:54:56.44
other thing I was like a young single guy. So it was what trip am I going on? All of them. Going to teach

601
00:54:56.44 --> 00:55:00.76
diving. Going to teach in my warfare. Going to teach CQC. Mount Epigore to teach and everything.

602
00:55:01.32 --> 00:55:06.20
And spec recon cool. I'm going on the spec recon trip. So really just got to teach everything.

603
00:55:06.20 --> 00:55:10.12
And then you could watch and your de facto detach from what's happening. So you're watching.

604
00:55:10.12 --> 00:55:16.04
We used to teach the new guys that came to seal team one. We would put them through their

605
00:55:16.04 --> 00:55:20.28
initial course of training. So then I'm watching the young officers. And I was just, I was an

606
00:55:20.28 --> 00:55:25.16
enlisted guy, but now watching these young officers and seeing like, oh, this guy is getting totally,

607
00:55:25.16 --> 00:55:28.36
he's been spending all this time shooting his weapon. So no one's making any calls. I never

608
00:55:28.36 --> 00:55:32.04
were going to do that. I'm never going to make that mistake. And this guy over here is imposing his

609
00:55:32.04 --> 00:55:36.68
plan on the rest of his squad. So they're all pissed at him. I'm not going to make that mistake. So I

610
00:55:36.68 --> 00:55:41.88
got to learn like I said, I might even be more than 70% from just being a young,

611
00:55:42.60 --> 00:55:50.76
E5 teaching at CLT1. And then also you had these senior guys that were super knowledgeable and

612
00:55:50.76 --> 00:55:57.80
they're teaching you. That's just freaking a good way to learn. But then you get picked up for this

613
00:55:57.80 --> 00:56:07.08
giant O billet. Yep. Yeah, so the giant O billet was awesome. I mean, it was awesome. So I had no training.

614
00:56:07.08 --> 00:56:12.76
So I mean, you have heard my story about my training in terms of IEDs. So an EOD guy goes to school

615
00:56:12.76 --> 00:56:18.12
for 69 months depending on what branch of service and what they did was they put me in Crystal

616
00:56:18.12 --> 00:56:23.80
City, you know, Hilton Lobby, Comfort Truman, and then like had a fake name for the conference,

617
00:56:23.80 --> 00:56:28.44
shut in lock the doors and they had some like old IED maker. And he gave us like a crash course on how

618
00:56:28.44 --> 00:56:33.48
to make a circuit essentially. And then how the explosives work. And so we did that for three days.

619
00:56:33.48 --> 00:56:39.88
And then they shipped me down range. And that was that. I mean, it was crazy. When you think about it.

620
00:56:39.88 --> 00:56:44.68
And I ended up then you were the IED expert. Then I was the one I just heard. I don't think they ever

621
00:56:44.68 --> 00:56:50.28
expected me to be the IED expert. They wanted EOD as obviously the IED expert. But what the billet was

622
00:56:50.28 --> 00:56:57.96
supposed to do was be the infantry interface to have enough knowledge of IEDs but to think like

623
00:56:57.96 --> 00:57:04.20
employment of infantry stuff and connect the route clearance button and the EOD and then be able

624
00:57:04.20 --> 00:57:12.20
to translate that into whatever is important to the batang commander. So you get your three A.S. schools

625
00:57:12.20 --> 00:57:18.28
and then you deploy right to Afghanistan. That's right. Yep. How was your life on this whole scenario?

626
00:57:18.28 --> 00:57:27.80
My wife. I stoked was she. So did. Yeah. So we got. Because she's like oh you're home.

627
00:57:27.80 --> 00:57:32.20
Oh, sure. You kind of have a normal job. I get almost like a night. Then I got her pregnant.

628
00:57:32.20 --> 00:57:37.48
So she was three months pregnant and then I went to Afghanistan. Right. I'll tell a story

629
00:57:38.20 --> 00:57:41.72
because it just kind of illustrates the stress on a military family. So we were going

630
00:57:41.72 --> 00:57:47.08
crib shopping. She knows I'm going to Afghanistan. Again, I was we knew I was deploying when she was

631
00:57:47.08 --> 00:57:51.32
three months. So we're going crib shopping and we were going to like this is like the third store.

632
00:57:51.32 --> 00:57:55.40
Like I hate shopping. So we're going to like the third store and I see a crib. I'm like this one.

633
00:57:55.40 --> 00:57:59.48
I went this one. Let's get this one. She's like I want to keep looking around and I'm like well

634
00:57:59.48 --> 00:58:03.000
I'm just going to stand here by this crib that I like and you can keep walking around and I'll

635
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.84
be right here and then she just broke down crying and it had nothing. Was this the first baby?

636
00:58:08.84 --> 00:58:11.80
Yeah. Was this the first girl's kid? This is a bad tackle.

637
00:58:11.80 --> 00:58:16.28
I know. Well, that's one tell a story. Like it was my mistake. People can learn from it. That's

638
00:58:16.28 --> 00:58:22.04
right. Better go walk around. Look at some great grips. I know. I know. And so that's what she's

639
00:58:22.04 --> 00:58:28.68
she's as she's crying. She's like you can look around. Come back when you're ready. I got it.

640
00:58:28.68 --> 00:58:32.36
I got it. Is it building relationships? She's talking about it.

641
00:58:33.64 --> 00:58:41.32
So bad move on my part. So then we I had to usher out. She's crying. I felt bad. We got in the car.

642
00:58:41.32 --> 00:58:45.16
We drove home and it was like one of those really awkward and tense situations. We had to buy

643
00:58:45.16 --> 00:58:51.08
the crib online because we couldn't bring ourselves a look for a crib again. And then I deployed.

644
00:58:51.08 --> 00:58:57.16
So I tell that story just to say, you know, I really wanted to go to Afghanistan. But it comes.

645
00:58:57.16 --> 00:59:01.40
These things come out of cost, right? So I got pregnant wife who's trying to be very supportive.

646
00:59:01.40 --> 00:59:04.68
She was a supportive of me staying. She was even supportive of me going to Afghanistan.

647
00:59:05.32 --> 00:59:09.08
But it doesn't mean that it doesn't come with some type of personal cost.

648
00:59:10.76 --> 00:59:14.76
So she's three months pregnant when you leave for Afghanistan. How long is the deployment

649
00:59:14.76 --> 00:59:18.92
to Afghanistan? Oh, you're. And did you come home for the birth of your kid?

650
00:59:18.92 --> 00:59:22.52
I, so you get when it's a year you get. It's already too long. But answer it.

651
00:59:23.24 --> 00:59:28.52
You get two weeks. But I missed I missed the birth. But I was able to come home like

652
00:59:29.24 --> 00:59:32.76
right as she like four days after the birth. So right after she got out of the hospital. So I

653
00:59:32.76 --> 00:59:37.64
did get two weeks with them. But I mean, I haven't two weeks with the baby after you've been in

654
00:59:37.64 --> 00:59:43.32
just combat every day for six months knowing you're going back to that same place for another six

655
00:59:43.32 --> 00:59:50.36
months. It was real hard to establish any emotional connection because like, I mean, that's just,

656
00:59:50.36 --> 00:59:54.68
it was, I would almost have rather not gone home and be honest with you because it, like you're,

657
00:59:54.68 --> 00:59:58.92
when you're with them, your mind's there, when you're there, your mind's with them. And so

658
00:59:59.88 --> 01:00:03.48
yeah, in some ways it was good. But other ways it was, it was very hard.

659
01:00:04.52 --> 01:00:10.84
So you go on deployment. Who are you, who you with? So I got two. It's like a solo operation.

660
01:00:10.84 --> 01:00:17.40
That's right. It was just a studio diverse solo. I got through Bogram Airbus and that's where

661
01:00:17.40 --> 01:00:21.88
Gita's task force was that. So they called a test force pilot in the Afghanistan.

662
01:00:21.88 --> 01:00:26.68
So they got the task force pilot in headquarters and they decided it's, because most Marines are

663
01:00:26.68 --> 01:00:32.20
familiar with Southwest, Helmond, and Candahar. But they didn't send me there. They sent me to RC East

664
01:00:32.20 --> 01:00:38.52
to support the 101st Army Division. And so I got out, the first unit I got to was a

665
01:00:38.52 --> 01:00:44.76
Italian called 3187 and they were in East Pactica Province. And the Favrega tattoo was organ.

666
01:00:45.88 --> 01:00:52.28
And their company, Favre's were also dispersed that any time we had to take them logistics,

667
01:00:52.68 --> 01:00:58.28
it was like a one day road trip throughout Clarence, Petune and EOD. And any time there was an EOD

668
01:00:58.28 --> 01:01:02.04
response. We had to fly out on the fly line. And I was just, I say that just to say it was very

669
01:01:02.04 --> 01:01:07.48
distributed. And like most people or Marines, picture of Afghanistan and it's just like desert,

670
01:01:07.48 --> 01:01:13.000
wasteland. It was like the Rocky Mountains where I was at. I mean it was not what I was expecting.

671
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.96
And I got out there and I was like, this is, this is not the desert. And so you could see Pakistan

672
01:01:17.96 --> 01:01:22.36
from where we were at. It was just, it was a cowboy country. And then what were you doing?

673
01:01:23.64 --> 01:01:28.28
Well, I guess explain a little bit more detail. So you get, there's a logistics supply that needs

674
01:01:28.28 --> 01:01:33.40
to go to some outstation. I'll illustrate with one war story from that time frame.

675
01:01:33.40 --> 01:01:40.76
So one of the company Favre's hadn't been resupplied in a while. And so they planned this,

676
01:01:40.76 --> 01:01:45.80
because in the, to a lot of August it was raining a lot. And so when it rains, the aircraft couldn't

677
01:01:45.80 --> 01:01:51.64
fly, the logistical supplies. And just because they, with all these jingle trucks, it was easier

678
01:01:51.64 --> 01:01:57.32
to move logistics. So we took this huge patrol. So I went with EOD and wrapped Clarence Patrol

679
01:01:57.32 --> 01:02:01.72
and all these logistics trucks out to this company Favre and dropped it off. And then when we got there,

680
01:02:01.72 --> 01:02:07.000
they said, hey, we've got this platoon outpost over here on the border near Pakistan that just

681
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.24
hasn't had whatever in so many days. Like, we really need you guys to push this stuff out here. We,

682
01:02:11.24 --> 01:02:15.16
we here at the company Favre don't have the assets. If you call back to the time and they're like,

683
01:02:15.16 --> 01:02:20.04
yeah, if you can, that would be great. So we do. So next day, then we go from this company Favre

684
01:02:20.04 --> 01:02:24.52
out to the platoon Favre. But we left it like A-D-M. So how many vehicles are you bringing with you?

685
01:02:24.52 --> 01:02:30.92
So you got the disaroff estimate. Rob Clarence Patrol soon is probably a dozen. You got the EOD truck

686
01:02:30.92 --> 01:02:34.52
in there. You've got, are you guys an M-Rapz? What are you in? What are you in?

687
01:02:34.52 --> 01:02:41.72
Yeah, it's J-Rapz. J-Rapz and J-L-T-Vs mix. But they also had a lot of logistics trucks. We're

688
01:02:41.72 --> 01:02:46.44
jingled trucks. You know, that is like a Afghani flatbed. And then you've got the Afghan National

689
01:02:46.44 --> 01:02:51.64
Security Force. So they're all in their F-150 pickup trucks. And then you got probably an infantry

690
01:02:51.64 --> 01:02:57.08
platoon or company for extra security that maybe in just homevies. And so it's this. So this is a big

691
01:02:57.08 --> 01:03:04.76
comery. Long collection of different players. And so we drive through to get to these things on

692
01:03:04.76 --> 01:03:10.28
the border. There's not roads. You're driving through like the creek beds of the mountain crevices.

693
01:03:11.24 --> 01:03:15.32
And we get to there and like, let's call it one or two o'clock in the afternoon. So there's

694
01:03:16.92 --> 01:03:23.88
15 vehicles, 20 vehicles? I'd say like 40. 40 vehicles to go out and resupply up all the tune.

695
01:03:23.88 --> 01:03:31.24
Yes. Which, by the way, has 40 guys. Yes. So this is like already you can see what this is like crazy

696
01:03:31.24 --> 01:03:39.08
shit going on. Yes. Okay. So 40. So a 40 vehicle convoy with every type of vehicles, madmax

697
01:03:39.72 --> 01:03:46.60
is driving out to resupply 40 dudes that are out on the edge of the world. They were on the edge

698
01:03:46.60 --> 01:03:52.04
of the world, yes. And so it's maybe like two o'clock when we come out of the creek bed. And

699
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:55.88
this is relevant to the story. When we came out of the creek bed there was like five afghanies

700
01:03:55.88 --> 01:03:59.56
sitting there with like their arms crossed, staring at us and we're like, let's look at these in the

701
01:03:59.56 --> 01:04:04.04
various characters. Like, one of these guys going to do, and nothing happened. And we were all kind of

702
01:04:04.04 --> 01:04:09.96
item and that's relevant later. So we go into the top. We drop all this applies off. It's like three

703
01:04:09.96 --> 01:04:14.60
clock. And the call is made like, what do we do? It's three clock. I mean, it took us like do the

704
01:04:14.60 --> 01:04:19.16
math eight to three to get here. Do we want to go back or do we get sleep here tonight? And again,

705
01:04:19.16 --> 01:04:24.68
40 vehicles, like the civil pull tune outposts were like, so probably a bad call. I mean, the

706
01:04:24.68 --> 01:04:28.28
hindsight 2020 obviously is a bad call. But at the time it just made sense of like, let's just go,

707
01:04:28.28 --> 01:04:33.16
like, you know, get back late. It will be alright. So when we start driving back, now we're going

708
01:04:33.16 --> 01:04:36.60
back into that creek bed where those guys are now it's nighttime. No, it's like three clock.

709
01:04:36.60 --> 01:04:43.000
Okay. When we leave, it gets dark soon. So we're going back in this creek bed and where those guys

710
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.16
were standing, they had piled a bunch of rocks up to the the creek bed. Well, obviously this is

711
01:04:49.16 --> 01:04:55.64
going to be an ambush. These guys piled a bunch of rocks as a marking mechanism or as a blocking

712
01:04:55.64 --> 01:05:01.16
mechanism. Great question. Okay. Check. You know what I mean? So we didn't ask that very intelligent

713
01:05:01.16 --> 01:05:06.76
question. We just immediately assumed ambush because that that had happened to us before. So we're

714
01:05:06.76 --> 01:05:09.80
like, all right, these guys are going to ambush us. So you sit there, you got your eyes up and

715
01:05:09.80 --> 01:05:13.16
you're looking around. Nothing happened. And then it's just like, all right, well let them trigger

716
01:05:13.16 --> 01:05:16.84
the ambush. I were going to go through it and we went through it and nothing happened. And then we just

717
01:05:16.84 --> 01:05:25.64
didn't think through anything else and we just started going. So we get now it's dark. It's probably

718
01:05:25.64 --> 01:05:31.72
eight o'clock. Are the Afghans? Are you on night vision? Because I know you're on night. But what

719
01:05:31.72 --> 01:05:38.28
the Afghans do? The Django trucks are on night vision. I can't remember. They were so far back

720
01:05:38.28 --> 01:05:44.76
that if their lights were on, I didn't see it. Yeah. I can't remember. It's a good question. I don't

721
01:05:44.76 --> 01:05:51.48
remember. So we were, it's now like eight or nine o'clock. It's dark and started raining. And I can't,

722
01:05:51.48 --> 01:05:56.52
it's hard to describe. It's almost as if somebody had broken a dam because it wasn't like the

723
01:05:56.52 --> 01:06:01.64
creek bed started slowly filling up. It was almost like a wave came down and hit the tires.

724
01:06:01.64 --> 01:06:07.16
This is like flash floods in area of eye desert. And so, but it's still only at the tires and

725
01:06:07.16 --> 01:06:11.56
the m-raps in the jail TVs go through it's still pretty easily. But then we get the call on the radio

726
01:06:11.56 --> 01:06:16.76
that one of the Django trucks had gotten stuck. You know, I can't even see it. It's so far back. So I'm like,

727
01:06:16.76 --> 01:06:21.16
all right. And your job in all this is like an observer or you're not in charge of anything.

728
01:06:21.16 --> 01:06:26.36
I'm not in charge of anything. But it's weird because I outrank the boat. Yeah. Yeah.

729
01:06:26.36 --> 01:06:32.12
You know what I mean? Yeah. So you've kind of orange, George. Right. You're in charge. In a way, yes.

730
01:06:32.12 --> 01:06:40.12
Right. And so we stop. We're waiting for the Django truck to un-mess itself. And then all of a sudden it was like

731
01:06:40.12 --> 01:06:45.88
another dam broke. And then the water hit right to our grill. It's like almost immediately. And now it's a

732
01:06:45.88 --> 01:06:54.44
situation where you can't just get out of the car. And so we, a little backstory, we had killed

733
01:06:54.44 --> 01:06:59.32
Taliban members and taken their icons. And then we keep this is on the same operation. This is on

734
01:06:59.32 --> 01:07:05.40
previous one. Okay. So I'm telling the story. So to the understand, we kept the icons in the patrol

735
01:07:05.40 --> 01:07:10.12
and we put it on scan. And when the Taliban started talking, we'd catch it on the scan. Then we'd

736
01:07:10.12 --> 01:07:14.20
hand it to the turp, the turp, and interpret it. And then we'd pass over the radio, whatever it was being said.

737
01:07:15.08 --> 01:07:21.64
So when we were in the flash flood, now we're like worrying about the water. It comes across the

738
01:07:21.64 --> 01:07:26.76
radio. Like, hey, the Taliban sees that we're stuck in the water and they're maneuvering to ambush on us.

739
01:07:26.76 --> 01:07:32.20
Okay. Yeah. So now you're now you're in a situation where it's like, all right,

740
01:07:32.76 --> 01:07:36.04
what's your poison? Like, because the machine guns are all hooked up to the trucks.

741
01:07:36.76 --> 01:07:42.20
But at a certain point, you might drown if you stay with the truck. You might drown just trying to get to the

742
01:07:42.20 --> 01:07:48.76
shore. So it's like, what do you do? Well, we all got up on the roofs of our trucks. And the water

743
01:07:48.76 --> 01:07:53.56
kept coming up. And finally, I was like, I, I, I'm going to die from drowning before I die,

744
01:07:53.56 --> 01:07:58.20
getting shot with the, with the Taliban. So I'm going to take my chances. So I, I slung my weapon.

745
01:07:58.60 --> 01:08:03.16
And I, I was the first one to jump in. I jumped in. I swam ashore. Current was ripened, but I'm a pretty

746
01:08:03.16 --> 01:08:08.60
good swimmer. I got over there. And then I started making rope bridges. So I tied some rope up to a tree

747
01:08:08.60 --> 01:08:13.08
through it to the truck. And then we started having guys shimmy in from the trucks over to the shore.

748
01:08:13.08 --> 01:08:17.40
And so then we passed this down. All the trucks start doing it. Well, what happened was one of the

749
01:08:17.40 --> 01:08:24.28
soldiers in the back got on a rope bridge. And when he put the weight of him, when he got in the water,

750
01:08:24.28 --> 01:08:29.88
he panicked and he let go. And he didn't like clip in or anything. And so he rips down river. So then the

751
01:08:29.88 --> 01:08:35.40
call comes on the radio. Hey, we lost a soldier. He's, he's done. He's gone. This is an half dance

752
01:08:35.40 --> 01:08:40.36
soldier on my sermon. No, it's an American. It's an American soldier. Yep. And the afghate. So he

753
01:08:40.36 --> 01:08:45.88
when he floats down river, one of the ANSF, the ANSF, same to the afghate national security

754
01:08:45.88 --> 01:08:50.60
forces. And so they all start talking about how they saw him. And he basically, from our last vehicle,

755
01:08:50.60 --> 01:08:56.12
they spot him, float by him. So we know he's still ripping down the river. Right? So now you're in a

756
01:08:56.12 --> 01:08:59.32
situation where people are starting to get in off the trucks. We know the towel bands moving

757
01:08:59.32 --> 01:09:03.88
and we're just lost the sky down the river. And it's like, this is getting messy real quick.

758
01:09:03.88 --> 01:09:08.68
This is a little beyond getting mess. Yeah. And so we try to call in air support.

759
01:09:09.80 --> 01:09:13.80
You know, good to go to God going down the river, all this stuff. And they deny it because it's raining.

760
01:09:13.80 --> 01:09:19.000
And it's red air. And so they say, no. So I grab a bunch of guys and I'm like,

761
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.80
clon, follow me. We're going to go do a patrol. We're going to try and find this guy.

762
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.40
And it's it's weird because I'm not really my guys. So I got to like play diplomat. You

763
01:09:27.40 --> 01:09:32.20
like, can I have some of your guys to go do this? But I had good relationships. So I was able to do that.

764
01:09:32.76 --> 01:09:39.40
And then it gets even weirder. So then the Taliban passed over their radio that they had

765
01:09:39.40 --> 01:09:45.32
captured the American soldier. So we got we picked up a chatter that the Taliban has the American

766
01:09:45.32 --> 01:09:50.36
soldier. And so then we're all like, man, we got it. The acronym was Dust One. So we got a Dust One

767
01:09:50.36 --> 01:09:54.68
situation. So we call that over the radio. And previously they said they wouldn't send aircraft.

768
01:09:54.68 --> 01:09:58.36
But this time now that because we're right there on the border Pakistan, when the Taliban

769
01:09:58.36 --> 01:10:02.92
confirmed that they have one of our men, they're like, we're sending an airport. So they send this

770
01:10:02.92 --> 01:10:08.28
section of the patchies like immediately. And it was awesome. I mean, it was a female section

771
01:10:08.28 --> 01:10:12.84
Lee. And I was listening to her on the radio. And she must have killed like 20 dudes. And she was just

772
01:10:12.84 --> 01:10:19.32
like stoic. Like killed five secondary explosion RPG. He's dead. And like we were just watching her.

773
01:10:19.32 --> 01:10:25.80
Just like sweet this hillside, just laying waste. And I was just fast forward to end of this story.

774
01:10:26.52 --> 01:10:32.12
What happened was the soldier we ended up finding him the next morning. He washed down river. He

775
01:10:32.12 --> 01:10:39.32
drowned. And we ended up actually having, we thought he would have been rigged with explosives. And so my

776
01:10:39.32 --> 01:10:43.32
year D tech put his bombs and walked up to him in the river and cut him down and many

777
01:10:43.32 --> 01:10:47.40
footed down river actually caught him and pulled him out. And I don't know if you're ever seen

778
01:10:47.40 --> 01:10:52.52
him in this drown, but like their stomach expands and they get all these veins. And what had happened

779
01:10:52.52 --> 01:10:59.16
was the Taliban, even though we were listening to them, they were monitoring the ANSF radios.

780
01:10:59.16 --> 01:11:06.44
And when the ANSF saw the soldier float by, they got on their radios. The Taliban heard that.

781
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And then they pat knowing that we were listening to them passed misinformation to get into our

782
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.36
loop. But you know, when I when our flight back on it, them doing that triggered the

783
01:11:18.36 --> 01:11:24.20
apachees, which ultimately killed all of them. So it's just one of those situations that I mean.

784
01:11:24.20 --> 01:11:29.16
So you asked me like, what did we do? Like, there's a story of like, you know, you leave that and

785
01:11:29.16 --> 01:11:33.88
it was what we were doing a resupply for a普通 fob. And you just walk away from like that was

786
01:11:34.28 --> 01:11:39.88
just a lot to unpack right there. So did the water eventually received and the vehicles were able to

787
01:11:39.88 --> 01:11:44.12
drive after that? The next morning they went down and we were able to get all the vehicles out because we

788
01:11:44.12 --> 01:11:50.52
brought from external sources, some records to help us pull stuff out. But they made us go up and

789
01:11:50.52 --> 01:11:56.84
down the river looking for the soldiers rifle and MVGs, which we weren't going to find. But we spent

790
01:11:56.84 --> 01:12:01.48
probably until lunchtime the next day just walking through the water acting like we were going to find

791
01:12:01.48 --> 01:12:04.92
that. And finally somebody made the decision to stop and then we got back on our trucks and left.

792
01:12:07.56 --> 01:12:13.56
And what's the uptempo like for you? So that's one mission that takes two days, three days.

793
01:12:13.56 --> 01:12:17.80
What are you doing after that? So, you know, then you go back to the company fob. Maybe spend

794
01:12:17.80 --> 01:12:22.12
a day reset and then you drive back to the batayan fob. And then I involved myself in the batayan

795
01:12:22.12 --> 01:12:26.92
battle rhythm, the meetings. I continued offered advice, but every time we're back at the batayan fob,

796
01:12:27.80 --> 01:12:33.48
anywhere in the batayan battle space where an IED is found in my EOD text fly out there I would go with them.

797
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:40.20
I mean, I could just keep going for stories all day. But we, here's an example and that same space.

798
01:12:40.20 --> 01:12:46.60
There was a helicopter that was flying a ISO container of machine guns out to one of the outposts

799
01:12:46.60 --> 01:12:50.44
and it pickled it, which means it, I don't know what happened, but they decided to drop the

800
01:12:50.44 --> 01:12:54.52
ISO container of the middle mountains. So like, hey, we need you to go up there, check it out.

801
01:12:54.52 --> 01:12:58.92
We want to send you OD because there might be explosives in it. So we fly up there, we get to the

802
01:12:58.92 --> 01:13:02.20
thing, see if we can re-sling load it, we can't. So we're just going to blow it up, they're like,

803
01:13:02.20 --> 01:13:05.96
no, you can't blow it up, it's got machine gun and stuff. And like, well, it's all burnt.

804
01:13:05.96 --> 01:13:09.80
They're like, it doesn't matter, you got to carry it out. So I was literally carrying like 250

805
01:13:09.80 --> 01:13:15.08
caliber severs, like through the mountains and there was all unusable, but they didn't want to leave it there.

806
01:13:15.08 --> 01:13:20.76
And we were supposed to fly out that night. So I didn't bring, this is such a stupid move. I didn't

807
01:13:20.76 --> 01:13:26.84
bring like warming layers or things for the next day. And of course, because it took us so long

808
01:13:26.84 --> 01:13:30.60
carry all that stuff, then it got dark and then the aircraft didn't want to land in the mountains.

809
01:13:30.60 --> 01:13:35.96
So we just spend the night up there and I, I almost froze to death. I remember the only thing we had

810
01:13:35.96 --> 01:13:41.80
was a body bag and I slept in the body bag, spooning another man so that I wouldn't freeze it

811
01:13:41.80 --> 01:13:46.36
that. I mean, talk about in your head when you're like in the body bag, right?

812
01:13:47.72 --> 01:13:53.24
Yeah, as you're doing these operations, what do you, what do you, you mentioned that earlier

813
01:13:53.24 --> 01:13:57.48
when you're in your body and you're handing out hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars

814
01:13:57.48 --> 01:14:03.72
to various people? And you're starting to think from a strategic perspective, this doesn't seem

815
01:14:03.72 --> 01:14:10.76
like maybe the greatest idea in the world. When you got 40 vehicles going out to resupply, 40 soldiers

816
01:14:10.76 --> 01:14:16.36
out in an outstation somewhere and the risks involved, then now you lose a soldier which is

817
01:14:16.36 --> 01:14:24.44
freakin horrible. And now you're going to a mountain top to recover, destroy weapons because

818
01:14:24.44 --> 01:14:29.64
you're not allowed to blow them in place. What is your, what are your thoughts of this? Now you're

819
01:14:29.64 --> 01:14:34.68
how long you've been in for at this point? You're, yeah, so that was 11, so 7, 6, 7 years.

820
01:14:34.68 --> 01:14:41.32
So, so you've got a little bit more maturity as a, as a human and as a military officer. Are

821
01:14:41.32 --> 01:14:45.48
you starting to wonder what the hell's going on? Absolutely, I mean, you're just, I'm really

822
01:14:45.48 --> 01:14:50.92
good points right there. I think what ate me the most when I took that 40 vehicles to that 40

823
01:14:50.92 --> 01:14:56.84
manpatoon, I could see Pakistan. I could see their bases. I could see where they shot mortars

824
01:14:56.84 --> 01:15:02.20
at us from and we couldn't do anything. So, when you talk about strategic problems, like does

825
01:15:02.20 --> 01:15:07.48
America really want to win this war? Like, I can see the fucking home base right over there. Like,

826
01:15:07.48 --> 01:15:12.12
why can't I go over there and kill them? And so, I mean, when I look back at the Afghan war,

827
01:15:12.12 --> 01:15:17.80
my king read my brain around that, if I was going to put service members, lives at risk,

828
01:15:17.80 --> 01:15:22.20
I'm going to do whatever it takes to win the war. Or I'm not going to be there. But there was just

829
01:15:22.20 --> 01:15:27.08
a ton of things that we didn't do from a foreign policy standpoint to allow the service members to win

830
01:15:27.08 --> 01:15:32.92
the war. It's criminal almost. And so, yes, standing there at the border of Pakistan, I remember

831
01:15:32.92 --> 01:15:38.12
looking at their home bases and just taking this crazy. And then how long this deployment is a one-year

832
01:15:38.12 --> 01:15:43.08
deployment? Yeah. And in the middle of it, you go home. You missed the birth of your son, my first son.

833
01:15:43.08 --> 01:15:48.68
First son, but you show up what two three days, but after he's born. That's right. And now you're

834
01:15:48.68 --> 01:15:54.04
going through this transition of one day you're sitting there waiting to get blown up by an ID. And

835
01:15:54.04 --> 01:16:01.64
then next, now you're sitting looking at the new crib holding your son. Yeah. And I agree, I know it's

836
01:16:01.64 --> 01:16:07.48
horrible to say, but like the mindset of not wanting to be a part of that kind of while you're

837
01:16:07.48 --> 01:16:12.92
still trying to work, I never, you know, in the Navy, we go on six months, maybe seven months,

838
01:16:12.92 --> 01:16:17.48
maybe eight months deployments. And I never went home from one of them. You know, the army

839
01:16:17.48 --> 01:16:24.36
would send guys home because they'd be on deployment, God bless them for 12 months, 14 months, 16 months.

840
01:16:24.36 --> 01:16:30.60
They, it was mandatory that they would send guys home. And even even like battalion commanders would

841
01:16:30.60 --> 01:16:36.28
go home for two weeks to give guys a break and give guys rest and let them see their families.

842
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.32
But you go home, it's, it's two weeks at home. I mean, are you able to adapt at all? Or is it just,

843
01:16:43.32 --> 01:16:51.08
I just, I just send me back. I think maybe if your home life was consistent, there might be

844
01:16:51.08 --> 01:16:56.68
some utility in it. But when my home life had changed so much, like my wife couldn't even stay

845
01:16:56.68 --> 01:17:01.16
in her house because she had just had a kid. She was bedridden. She was at her mom's.

846
01:17:02.04 --> 01:17:05.72
You know, they're, I'm not able to take care of her. She's having to have her mom take care of her.

847
01:17:05.72 --> 01:17:10.12
So I've got to, for my two, he's go stay at my mother-in-laws. I've got a new kid.

848
01:17:10.12 --> 01:17:16.04
I mean, it just, it was like I was living somebody else's life when I came home and again, all you

849
01:17:16.04 --> 01:17:20.04
can think about is the constant combat you're going to go back to and it was just a lot.

850
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.28
You roll back over there and you just maintain this optempo for the year that you're there. That's right.

851
01:17:28.84 --> 01:17:36.52
I mean, random operations, tag along on random operations. Well, I, I moved,

852
01:17:36.52 --> 01:17:41.88
probably in October, November,ish. I moved out of Eastern Pectica and moved into a

853
01:17:41.88 --> 01:17:47.96
Providence called Gazzini. There was a district called Andar. So we built the base from the ground up,

854
01:17:47.96 --> 01:17:54.84
called Andar, Fawbandar. And I moved to support 187. So I went from 3187 to 187.

855
01:17:55.72 --> 01:18:02.20
And back then, so this is in 2010, the Polish headroom that Aia for like two or three years.

856
01:18:02.20 --> 01:18:07.16
The Polish don't fire unless it's in self-defense, don't do anything aggressively. So that's why they put

857
01:18:07.16 --> 01:18:12.76
Americans there. And so again, we've been at war for at eight years at that point and it was almost

858
01:18:12.76 --> 01:18:17.32
like uncharted territory in the middle of Afghanistan. I mean, Gazzini is like the economic

859
01:18:17.96 --> 01:18:23.56
center, you know, maybe outside of Kabul. And so for, you know, it's similar to Ramani,

860
01:18:23.56 --> 01:18:28.68
where like I went to Sua, we've been in Ramani for six years and also, and I'm using baby wipes

861
01:18:28.68 --> 01:18:32.44
and we have no infrastructure and it's like, it's like we've never been there before. I felt

862
01:18:32.44 --> 01:18:36.52
this at the same thing happened when we went to Fawbandar. They were building it from the ground up.

863
01:18:36.52 --> 01:18:41.24
And it's even the the kinetic threat. It was like no one had done anything.

864
01:18:42.12 --> 01:18:46.92
And that area was different than the first one I described because the first one was much more

865
01:18:46.92 --> 01:18:51.24
distributed and which is like these long day patrols. That one was very much like day and day out,

866
01:18:51.24 --> 01:18:57.16
day and day out like flip patrol from the base or route clearance to just that adjacent little

867
01:18:57.16 --> 01:19:03.96
block over there. And so you were out, you actually moved to that outstation to that Fawbandar.

868
01:19:03.96 --> 01:19:07.16
Yes. And how big was that Fawbandar? How many people were there? Was it like a company

869
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:10.84
Fawbandar? Was it a battalion? It's time to head quarters, but all their companies were in

870
01:19:10.84 --> 01:19:15.40
company outpost. So I mean, there was only probably 200 people in it. Did they have a company there

871
01:19:15.40 --> 01:19:22.04
that they were utilizing for that AO? That was running out operations for them. Yeah, I understand the

872
01:19:22.04 --> 01:19:26.52
question. I think I think potentially one of the companies was in the Battalion Fawbandar because

873
01:19:26.52 --> 01:19:32.68
obviously somebody owned that battle space. I can't remember. And so then you're there and you're

874
01:19:32.68 --> 01:19:36.20
doing the same thing. You're going out on patrol, whoever's going out on patrol, trying to capture

875
01:19:36.20 --> 01:19:40.92
the ID information, sending that ID information back up the chain of command. Yeah, so

876
01:19:42.12 --> 01:19:46.04
a couple more stories just illustrate that kind of what I did. One time one of the companies

877
01:19:46.84 --> 01:19:52.60
found a house full of, it looked like propane tanks, but I was like aluminum tanks filled with powder,

878
01:19:52.60 --> 01:19:57.32
found like a hundred of them. Just didn't know what it was. And so they threw them all in a well.

879
01:19:57.32 --> 01:20:00.76
And then they took a picture of it, put it on a storyboard. Wait a second.

880
01:20:01.88 --> 01:20:06.60
So the platoon's out on patrol. They find a hundred aluminum tanks filled with random powder.

881
01:20:06.60 --> 01:20:09.88
Yep. They don't know what to do with it, so they chuck them in a well. That's exactly right.

882
01:20:09.88 --> 01:20:14.84
They did not misstate that. And then, you know, young Captain Schellers

883
01:20:15.08 --> 01:20:18.76
reviewing the storyboards, because I felt like that was the right thing to do. Again, I didn't have

884
01:20:18.76 --> 01:20:22.60
a boss. So it was like, you know, as in general sport as a baton, but I really could have done

885
01:20:22.60 --> 01:20:26.52
nothing. How did I chose to do? But every day, went through all the storyboards, went through all the

886
01:20:26.52 --> 01:20:30.36
cigarettes, went through all stuff like was really trying to help myself. That's story right there. Like,

887
01:20:30.36 --> 01:20:35.16
I could, I could just imagine looking at what am I with two graders like, okay, tell me that again.

888
01:20:35.16 --> 01:20:39.40
Yeah, yeah. Wait, so what you do? Wait, what was in them? And you hooked them all in the well?

889
01:20:39.40 --> 01:20:43.32
And they were so ignorant. They then took a picture of it and put it in your storyboard.

890
01:20:43.32 --> 01:20:46.44
Usually you do something that like raises an eyebrow and you're like, I don't know if I should have

891
01:20:46.44 --> 01:20:50.36
done that. You know, and included it on the storyboard. So they put it in the storyboard. It's one of

892
01:20:50.36 --> 01:20:55.32
those things where I bet, up old team commander can articulate, you know, what we didn't know what to do.

893
01:20:55.32 --> 01:20:58.44
We couldn't carry them out. We didn't want the enemy to use them. The well was deep.

894
01:20:59.24 --> 01:21:02.68
Made the call. Sir. Yeah. It's like, okay, Roger that. I'm going to have to talk

895
01:21:02.68 --> 01:21:04.76
on brief this up the chain of command, but I got you back.

896
01:21:06.84 --> 01:21:12.60
Yeah. Okay. So it turns out it was aluminum powder. So in that AO, so in the first one, I was at

897
01:21:12.60 --> 01:21:16.68
it was all potassium chloride. There was a match factor in Pakistan. So all the IDs were

898
01:21:16.68 --> 01:21:23.16
potassium chloride. But in this new AO, they used aluminum powder with ammonium nitrate. So we

899
01:21:23.16 --> 01:21:28.28
called that anal actually. And so what they had in those containers was aluminum powder that they

900
01:21:28.28 --> 01:21:33.32
would mix with the fertilizer to make the IDs. And so I identified it. I pulled up a troll together.

901
01:21:33.32 --> 01:21:39.56
We went out. And when we got into the house, like, I'm literally holding this PowerPoint

902
01:21:39.56 --> 01:21:43.000
print out of the storyboard. It's got a picture of the house and it's got a well in it.

903
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.84
And I'm like walking around. There's no well on the Queen of the White House. It's kind of dark.

904
01:21:46.84 --> 01:21:53.000
What had happened is they, the Taliban had come behind the soldiers and put like plywood over the

905
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.56
well and then covered it in dirt. They basically hide the aluminum powder that the soldiers had

906
01:21:57.56 --> 01:22:01.72
all thrown in there. And so it took me like 45 minutes. But finally I was like, no, no, this is

907
01:22:01.72 --> 01:22:06.20
the house. Like, this has to be like right here. And then you start kicking it. You're like, oh, you know,

908
01:22:06.20 --> 01:22:12.12
so then we re-enit a disposal of all that. So there's one example of like, what does a counter-idee

909
01:22:12.12 --> 01:22:17.16
team leader do? You know, just caught that. And then the other thing I usually did was I walked the

910
01:22:17.16 --> 01:22:23.24
rails. So as an infantry guy, I would pull probably six or seven soldiers out of the route clearance.

911
01:22:23.24 --> 01:22:28.60
And on noon routes where we found a lot of IDs. And at the time I got my prawn star,

912
01:22:29.32 --> 01:22:33.88
where we were walking down a route, I'm on one side. There are on another side. And you could see

913
01:22:33.88 --> 01:22:38.44
guys messing with something on the road like probably an ID, right? So, you know, we try to close

914
01:22:38.44 --> 01:22:43.96
a distance. This guy runs away circles around. He's getting chased by my other guys on the other

915
01:22:43.96 --> 01:22:47.96
side street. And so he crosses the street while I'm running up the other side. And I was like one of

916
01:22:47.96 --> 01:22:51.96
the things where you like, you both come around a corner and you're like, based a phase. And you both

917
01:22:51.96 --> 01:22:56.28
just like try to pick up your guns and somehow you both miss each other from like three feet away.

918
01:22:56.28 --> 01:23:02.60
And you know, got behind a corner, killed a couple guys and some machine gun fire went off. And

919
01:23:02.60 --> 01:23:08.04
there was one point where like I just kept chasing people. And I found myself like 200 meters away

920
01:23:08.04 --> 01:23:12.60
from even like the guys I was with. Maybe like, you know, a half kilometer away from the patrol

921
01:23:12.60 --> 01:23:15.96
and the panic started to sit in my gosh, you know, like I'm kind of separated here.

922
01:23:15.96 --> 01:23:21.40
Um, but I was able to, I was able to bring the infantry up and link up and they got some

923
01:23:21.40 --> 01:23:26.44
orders down ranch. And the takeaway from the story is we uncovered seven ID's on the route that

924
01:23:26.44 --> 01:23:30.60
they rendered them all safe. And we were trying to do a complex ambush, right, with all those

925
01:23:30.60 --> 01:23:35.08
ID's and we were able to push, push them off. But like there's an example of like,

926
01:23:36.12 --> 01:23:41.64
great tactical success. Like what the fuck did that do in terms of the overall picture? Like I'm not

927
01:23:41.64 --> 01:23:46.28
really sure. Like on the tactical level. I mean, that was an awesome play that we ran.

928
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.24
But I mean, just got so many examples of that. And then then I start studying the operational strategic

929
01:23:51.24 --> 01:23:54.84
levels. And I'm like, where was the connection to what we're trying to do? Like, why are they still

930
01:23:54.84 --> 01:24:00.20
coming from Pakistan? You know, what is my political leaders doing? Like, are we trying to get

931
01:24:00.20 --> 01:24:04.68
rid of the Taliban? Or would we want to have sure OK? Yeah, so many questions.

932
01:24:07.96 --> 01:24:13.56
So you wrap up that deployment. Yep. You come home. How's coming home? Now that you're home home?

933
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:19.40
Yeah. So when I got home from Afghanistan, again, I was going to get out.

934
01:24:20.44 --> 01:24:24.12
But they offered me formal schools called Expedition Warfare School. It's Captain of

935
01:24:24.12 --> 01:24:30.28
Major School. It's a year. And I just thought, man, this deployment has taken a lot out of me,

936
01:24:30.28 --> 01:24:35.08
emotionally spiritually. Like a year in school with a bunch of other warfighters of my peer group

937
01:24:35.08 --> 01:24:39.32
probably really good for me rather than trying to jump into the corporate world. And so I took the

938
01:24:39.32 --> 01:24:45.24
U.S. job instead of getting out, which was in Quantico. You owe time after that. That's right. Right.

939
01:24:45.24 --> 01:24:50.44
Look at you. I want to step ahead of me. Yeah. So the catch to that is there's a two year

940
01:24:50.44 --> 01:24:55.80
requirement on the backside. So by taking the EWS job, I then was required to go serve two more years.

941
01:24:55.80 --> 01:24:58.68
This is a company command. And this is going to get you out to what how many years?

942
01:24:59.40 --> 01:25:04.92
Really gets me out to a career for us. But yeah, it takes me about 10 or 11 years. Yeah, 10 or 11 years.

943
01:25:04.92 --> 01:25:10.68
At which point a lot of guys say, hey, I'm only got, you know, what is it? You look at

944
01:25:10.68 --> 01:25:14.68
over one. Only got eight more years and really how many tours is that? Plus, one of

945
01:25:14.68 --> 01:25:18.04
that last tours of Twilight Tourists are really only have six years. So people start

946
01:25:18.04 --> 01:25:22.84
negotiating and rationalizing staying in. Even if maybe it's not 100% what they're into at the

947
01:25:22.84 --> 01:25:27.24
time. That's right. Which is, which is interesting because you're almost the whole time you've been

948
01:25:27.24 --> 01:25:31.72
saying you're going to get out. You're going to get out. You're going to get out. Which is weird. I

949
01:25:31.72 --> 01:25:37.64
never, I actually never thought I was ever going to get out until I got out. The whole time I thought

950
01:25:37.64 --> 01:25:43.56
I was staying in forever. I'm like, oh, I'm going to do 50 years. So watch this. And then it was a

951
01:25:43.56 --> 01:25:48.36
very abrupt for me. You know, when I was like, oh, you know what, I'm actually going to get out.

952
01:25:48.36 --> 01:25:55.24
And so I always thought I was going to stay in. Which was, which was, I guess it was very easy

953
01:25:55.24 --> 01:25:58.36
for my decision making process because I was like, okay, what do you guys need me to do? Yeah.

954
01:25:58.36 --> 01:26:01.48
What do you want me to do? Let me go to that, call go to that, whatever. Let's go.

955
01:26:02.52 --> 01:26:08.60
But you were always kind of, I think it was like we started with the beginning of my story.

956
01:26:08.60 --> 01:26:13.16
This, I never had ambitions to go in the military and this was never what I thought I would end

957
01:26:13.16 --> 01:26:18.36
up doing. The reason I continued to stay in is because I found a lot of purpose in being a

958
01:26:18.36 --> 01:26:23.56
marine officer and I truly enjoyed it, truly enjoyed being around the service members. So it's one

959
01:26:23.56 --> 01:26:29.32
of those things where I guess my self image was never to be a career military officer. But I

960
01:26:29.32 --> 01:26:34.04
continued doing it because I found fulfillment in it. Yeah, and there's also something beneficial

961
01:26:34.04 --> 01:26:40.44
about someone that's not considering that, oh, I want to be. You know, that's, I always joke about

962
01:26:40.44 --> 01:26:44.92
the seal teams because in the seal teams, if you ask a seal officer, a young seal officer,

963
01:26:45.64 --> 01:26:51.80
why they came in the seal teams, the answer, what job you want to do? I guarantee what they're

964
01:26:51.80 --> 01:26:56.28
going to say is, I want to be a platoon commander. I want to be a seal platoon commander. That's the,

965
01:26:56.28 --> 01:27:02.12
that's, which by the way, is like three years into your career. Yeah. You ask an army officer?

966
01:27:02.12 --> 01:27:06.36
What they want to do? A lot of them will say, oh, I want to be a battalion commander. I want to be a

967
01:27:06.36 --> 01:27:11.000
brigade commander. I want to be a division commander. That's actually in their head. Seal officers

968
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.24
do not have that in their head. Most seal officers don't have that in their head. And there's

969
01:27:15.24 --> 01:27:19.40
something that's kind of nice about someone that's in the army that just says, hey, you know, I want to be,

970
01:27:20.68 --> 01:27:26.04
hey, I want, I don't have this big aspirations of being a general or a kernel. They just want to go

971
01:27:26.04 --> 01:27:30.44
and do the job. There's some benefits to it. There's also some interactions to it because once

972
01:27:30.44 --> 01:27:33.96
guys in the seal teams get done with that platoon commander tour, a lot of them go, okay, you know,

973
01:27:33.96 --> 01:27:38.52
I did that. And we've, in the seal teams try to extend the operational tour a little bit longer. You know,

974
01:27:38.52 --> 01:27:42.76
you can, you can extend it. You can go a little bit longer and still do work. But eventually,

975
01:27:44.20 --> 01:27:48.36
it's going to dry up for you. And you don't get to be a battalion commander. You can

976
01:27:48.36 --> 01:27:54.28
seal team commander, but that's not the same as a battalion commander. It's really not the same as a brigade

977
01:27:54.28 --> 01:27:59.88
commander. Cool jobs, but it's not what people come in for. So the fact that you were sort of

978
01:27:59.88 --> 01:28:05.40
always thinking, maybe I'll get out means to me in a positive way, you weren't trying to maneuver

979
01:28:05.40 --> 01:28:10.12
for your career. Because there's a lot of guys that, oh, yeah, here's, oh, I need to do this billet.

980
01:28:10.12 --> 01:28:15.40
I'm trying to get this award. I'm trying to get this deployment so I can get promoted. There's

981
01:28:15.40 --> 01:28:21.16
some people that that's what's driving their careers. And it's, it's never, it's horrible to see.

982
01:28:21.16 --> 01:28:25.64
It's horrible to see what they do. And there's guys in the, certainly, guys in the seal

983
01:28:25.64 --> 01:28:30.68
teams that are like that. That's there. That did have the goal of the two commanders just a step,

984
01:28:30.68 --> 01:28:34.52
just a stepping stone. Because what they really want to do is they really want to make out more

985
01:28:34.52 --> 01:28:38.92
whatever, same thing can happen in the army as well, same thing can happen in the Marine Corps. But for

986
01:28:38.92 --> 01:28:44.28
you, you're kind of like playing it by ear. Which means you're not making decisions based on,

987
01:28:44.28 --> 01:28:48.44
hey, I'm going to look out for my career. Which is a good thing in many cases.

988
01:28:49.24 --> 01:28:54.68
Yeah, I see that in Marsau, too. What you're the proud me described with guys doing what they

989
01:28:54.68 --> 01:28:59.40
want to do is a lot of got Marsau guys want to be a team leader. Or, you know, want to be a company

990
01:28:59.40 --> 01:29:02.68
commander, company commander is kind of the pinnacle where they then bleed off all the talent. Because

991
01:29:02.68 --> 01:29:06.68
the company commander at Marsau is a major. And then they don't stick around to be the batang

992
01:29:06.68 --> 01:29:12.44
commanders that they need them to do. But I also see that the general infantry, a lot of the

993
01:29:12.44 --> 01:29:16.68
counter to what you just said, there's a lot of guys that come in that have aspirations for

994
01:29:16.68 --> 01:29:22.28
meat of the tank commander, have aspirations for being in general. And there, you know, you kind of

995
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:27.16
alluded to it. There may be some positives to that in terms of big thinking and, you know,

996
01:29:28.12 --> 01:29:33.80
speaking good about the system and figuring out how to navigate the system correctly. But I honestly

997
01:29:33.80 --> 01:29:40.04
think the focus should always be on the service member. And what's best for them? And I understand,

998
01:29:40.04 --> 01:29:44.28
as a leader, I've been doing this for 17 years, the responsibility to the organization,

999
01:29:44.28 --> 01:29:47.64
versus the responsibility to the service member. So I'm not saying all of our specs are

1000
01:29:47.64 --> 01:29:52.36
leader, or at least you just be looking after the service member. But I think when you get focused

1001
01:29:52.36 --> 01:29:57.40
on how to navigate your career, it does cloud your perspective on how to strike that balance.

1002
01:29:59.08 --> 01:30:05.24
So nonetheless, you take the deal. And you go, okay, I'm going to go expedition to war for a school.

1003
01:30:05.24 --> 01:30:11.000
And then I'm going to owe them two more years. So that's going to put you at 11 years, 12 years.

1004
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Your wife's probably like cool, at least this might, I might be gone a lot, but at least you've

1005
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.04
got a job, but it's we're getting a paycheck. Yeah, I had my, so as soon as I got back from Afghanistan,

1006
01:30:21.16 --> 01:30:26.28
she got pregnant with the same kid. So my two older boys are 14 and a half months apart. So that's like,

1007
01:30:26.28 --> 01:30:31.80
you know, before Afghanistan, and then like first time getting home from Afghanistan. And then it was like,

1008
01:30:31.80 --> 01:30:36.60
I, so I very quickly, within nine months of being home from Afghanistan, went from like no kids to two kids.

1009
01:30:36.60 --> 01:30:42.44
You know, so this was life was changing. And then we, we waited another couple of years and had my

1010
01:30:42.44 --> 01:30:47.000
third son in between my next two deployments. So how was expeditionary war for a school?

1011
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.92
I liked it. You know, the anxiety that I had after a body came back full fledged after Afghanistan,

1012
01:30:52.92 --> 01:30:58.20
started having different symptoms, started having like face numbness. And my vision started getting

1013
01:30:58.20 --> 01:31:02.12
blurred. And everyone wanted to lump it into PTSD, which I knew. I wasn't struggling with PTSD.

1014
01:31:02.12 --> 01:31:07.24
I didn't have like bad dreams. I felt bad about anything. I did. I'd said like Tony Suprenowish,

1015
01:31:07.24 --> 01:31:13.16
like real physical symptoms. And it just, people will then the buzz phrase was PTSD. And I just

1016
01:31:13.16 --> 01:31:18.76
don't think people understood what anxiety was. And I just had to work through that. And so I don't think

1017
01:31:18.76 --> 01:31:26.60
I really understand what what you're talking about. So PTSD would be like, oh, I'm having trouble sleeping.

1018
01:31:26.60 --> 01:31:32.68
I'm the hyper alert and all that. What's the anxiety piece? What's what's going on with this?

1019
01:31:32.68 --> 01:31:39.64
And is it physiological? It's both. So it's part hereditary, it's part, you know,

1020
01:31:39.64 --> 01:31:45.000
nurture nature. So also it's part experience. So I think the simplest way to just say it is once

1021
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:52.20
your fighter flight gets burnt enough, your brain starts producing different chemicals that it

1022
01:31:52.20 --> 01:31:58.04
may not be if you're not on high stress all the time. And for me, it just took a while to recalibrate.

1023
01:31:58.04 --> 01:32:04.28
I had to get into yoga, I had to get into meditation. The best remedies work it out. So if you

1024
01:32:04.28 --> 01:32:09.000
work out, stay healthy and stay fit. But the problem is a lot of guys after these deployments

1025
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.12
fall into the false trap of alcohol. And alcohol is one of those things where, you know,

1026
01:32:14.12 --> 01:32:17.72
it can suppress some of those anxiety or things for a little bit. But what they don't realize

1027
01:32:17.72 --> 01:32:24.04
is it comes back twice as worse the next day. And so EWS is one of those like false hopes for me.

1028
01:32:24.04 --> 01:32:28.44
Or I was like coming back, I hadn't been drinking for a year. And I was like drinking beer. And

1029
01:32:28.44 --> 01:32:34.20
I feel good at night in the next day. But I'm like, why do I feel so horrible? I was also getting

1030
01:32:34.20 --> 01:32:38.68
older too. I mean, my 30s now, not my 20s anymore. And so I think part of it was just

1031
01:32:38.68 --> 01:32:43.96
learning my body, learning all the physical reactions that took place in the deployment. And

1032
01:32:43.96 --> 01:32:49.56
not allowing myself to just be bend in a PTSD category that may not apply to me. Even though that's

1033
01:32:49.56 --> 01:32:53.72
what I think everyone wants to label someone when they get back from something like what I

1034
01:32:53.72 --> 01:32:58.60
had gone through. And you know, it all worked out. I figured it out. But just took me green a lot of

1035
01:32:58.60 --> 01:33:03.80
books and talking a lot of people. Probably more than I needed to navigate it. Let me ask you this.

1036
01:33:04.92 --> 01:33:12.28
So if you get these like anxiety type situation and it's caused from some traumatic situation that

1037
01:33:12.28 --> 01:33:17.72
you've been through. And now this is post the traumatic situation. Isn't it like what you're talking

1038
01:33:17.72 --> 01:33:23.72
about? Well, I don't understand the difference between PTSD and what you're talking about anxiety.

1039
01:33:23.72 --> 01:33:33.40
I think the the where way I distinguish it is PTSD from what I've learned from the psychologist,

1040
01:33:34.28 --> 01:33:42.92
typically manifests itself into guilt, shame, emotional struggling with some of the things that you went

1041
01:33:42.92 --> 01:33:49.40
through that may have a psychological and physical impact on you. Anxiety to me, think of it like

1042
01:33:49.40 --> 01:33:55.48
you're about to do public speaking and everyone has butterflies but like a severe case of

1043
01:33:55.48 --> 01:34:02.60
anxiety is almost like debilitating, right? And that those physical manifestations may not necessarily

1044
01:34:02.60 --> 01:34:09.64
be tied to a trauma. They may just be tied to the way like you said physiologically or builds,

1045
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:15.08
or it may just be because you have experienced so many things that your brain is producing chemicals

1046
01:34:15.08 --> 01:34:20.12
in balanced manner. Now I'm not a doctor, so somebody needs to check the stats on this, but I can't

1047
01:34:20.12 --> 01:34:24.92
tell you having talked to many psychologists, there is a in the whatever that manual is,

1048
01:34:26.36 --> 01:34:32.52
major differences between the two. Okay. And then you as you're working out and you're doing yoga

1049
01:34:32.52 --> 01:34:37.40
and you start to get through that the that calm after you went through the drinking phase of trying

1050
01:34:37.40 --> 01:34:44.12
to get through it. I always worked out, sometimes I worked out and drank, so I had to just

1051
01:34:44.12 --> 01:34:50.28
get through the drinking thing and then just focus on working out. And this is all happening while you're

1052
01:34:50.28 --> 01:34:58.04
at EWS, yeah correct. Learn anything good at EWS, what are you learning at EWS? EWS is a little bit more like

1053
01:34:58.04 --> 01:35:04.60
operational level. I went to two formal schools, I went to command and staff later as a major,

1054
01:35:04.60 --> 01:35:08.84
command of staff is very varsity level, treat you like an adult, here's all the reading, go read it,

1055
01:35:08.84 --> 01:35:13.88
and we'll talk about it. It was adult EWS is somewhere between you're still in the basic training

1056
01:35:13.88 --> 01:35:18.92
pipeline and you're getting close to an adult, but we're not really sure yet, so it's your

1057
01:35:18.92 --> 01:35:23.16
treated as such and there are a bunch of captains that aren't criss yet that probably need to be treated

1058
01:35:23.16 --> 01:35:26.68
like that, but thinking it's generalized too much. So there was a time when I was like,

1059
01:35:26.68 --> 01:35:30.04
I'm a professional and I've been doing multiple wars, like the fucking talk to me like that.

1060
01:35:30.04 --> 01:35:37.64
What's EWS? It stands for Expeditionary Warfare School. It's like the captain to major PME,

1061
01:35:37.64 --> 01:35:41.56
said so you don't have to go to the resident, but you have to do the school, so there's like

1062
01:35:41.56 --> 01:35:45.08
box of books where you can get sent the books and get credit for it that way, there's seminars

1063
01:35:45.08 --> 01:35:49.88
where you can go to like night school for it, so every captain has to go through it to become a major,

1064
01:35:49.88 --> 01:35:55.16
but they select the top ones to go to the resident one your course. That's where you got selected

1065
01:35:55.16 --> 01:35:58.68
for. That's right. So your career's going pretty good at this point actually. It was an indicator

1066
01:35:58.68 --> 01:36:06.84
that I was on the right track. And what do you, this is one year school, where you going at the

1067
01:36:06.84 --> 01:36:13.08
end of that? Where'd you go in the end of that? I went to third Battian second Marines as a company

1068
01:36:13.08 --> 01:36:18.84
commander, so it was a headquarters company commander where we, our deployment was another

1069
01:36:18.84 --> 01:36:25.88
mu, there's 10 months, get on ships, sail around the ocean and be ready to respond. And as a

1070
01:36:25.88 --> 01:36:30.36
headquarters company commander on a mu, I had like a reconplotin and I had an engineer putin

1071
01:36:30.36 --> 01:36:34.28
and then I had like all the supporting and the establishment and the Battian. This is kind of

1072
01:36:34.28 --> 01:36:40.92
an eclectic group of individuals and then they also used me as like the future operations planter

1073
01:36:40.92 --> 01:36:45.000
if you will. So as the episodes on the ship they'd send me to like Egypt or they'd send me to

1074
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.84
wherever to do the planning for whatever that bilateral was. And so that was my 10 months deployment there.

1075
01:36:50.84 --> 01:36:55.48
That was a 10 month deployment. Yeah, it was long ship forward deployment. It was like right after the

1076
01:36:56.60 --> 01:37:02.36
delibia thing and the Benghazi thing and like the, and because of that thing,

1077
01:37:03.08 --> 01:37:08.20
the mu deployments had gotten like backed up. Something happened that messed up the deployment

1078
01:37:08.20 --> 01:37:13.24
cycle, being close to that operation. And so to like fill the gap, my deployment was 10 months

1079
01:37:13.24 --> 01:37:18.04
because they always want overlap. And so I don't remember fully understand why it happened,

1080
01:37:18.04 --> 01:37:21.40
but they told us from the very beginning like this is going to be a long one boys. And that was a

1081
01:37:21.40 --> 01:37:27.88
ship board deployment. So you're living on a ship, which is good times. Yeah, something.

1082
01:37:29.72 --> 01:37:33.64
But that's weird. That's almost like for me, you know, because I came in before at the war.

1083
01:37:34.60 --> 01:37:39.88
That's like a normal deployment that we did back then. I did two deployments with the Marines

1084
01:37:39.88 --> 01:37:46.04
on the Args out here on the West Coast, but it was like, hey, sail around, go to wherever we're going.

1085
01:37:46.04 --> 01:37:52.68
Like I went to Egypt. I went to Oman went to these various random places and did whatever exercise

1086
01:37:52.68 --> 01:37:57.96
we're doing. People getting spun up about whatever they're getting spun up about. You probably

1087
01:37:57.96 --> 01:38:02.92
did you create any PowerPoint briefs where you're on that? You know, I did.

1088
01:38:06.36 --> 01:38:09.64
All right. So that's another deployment and what what comes after that.

1089
01:38:09.64 --> 01:38:16.28
So then I get back and they actually, I was still a captain and they tried to make me the operations officer.

1090
01:38:17.32 --> 01:38:24.60
And I did the battalion operation. Yeah. So I had actually gotten the top company commander,

1091
01:38:24.60 --> 01:38:28.52
finished report as the headquarters company commander, which kind of rare. So I think it just speaks to my

1092
01:38:28.52 --> 01:38:32.84
Patank commander really like me, thought highly of me. And so he tried to make me the operations officer.

1093
01:38:32.84 --> 01:38:37.48
And I wasn't selected that year. So I was going to be in zone the next year. And regiments like

1094
01:38:37.48 --> 01:38:41.40
brother, we got like five majors sitting on the deck up here that need to keep it. Like if you're

1095
01:38:41.40 --> 01:38:44.12
going to make a captain, it's not even selected. Like we're going to give you a major.

1096
01:38:44.76 --> 01:38:49.24
And so he came back to me and was like, hey, like this is what happened. So you're not going to be the

1097
01:38:49.24 --> 01:38:54.04
ops. So what do you want to do? Do you want to stay in the battalion? You've already done your

1098
01:38:54.04 --> 01:39:00.68
company commander to her or do you want to go somewhere else? And in my community, headquarters

1099
01:39:00.68 --> 01:39:05.24
company commander is like one of those weird ones where you can hide somebody there.

1100
01:39:05.24 --> 01:39:11.88
And so it's not always the best guy. And so like in terms of street cred and my community,

1101
01:39:11.88 --> 01:39:15.64
I didn't want people to think I was just a headquarters company commander, right? And so I was like,

1102
01:39:15.64 --> 01:39:19.000
you know, I got a, no, I'm going to stay here and I'm going to go be the weapons company commander.

1103
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.16
So they offer me weapons company, which is like the probably the best company commander usually in

1104
01:39:23.16 --> 01:39:27.24
battions. And so that's what I did. So I was a weapons company commander for the next year and a half.

1105
01:39:27.24 --> 01:39:32.28
Did you do an appointment? How's it look? I did. So we did a deployment. It's called a unit deployment

1106
01:39:32.28 --> 01:39:37.48
program. So we went to Okenawa and we're the purpose of it strategically. This did be involved in the

1107
01:39:37.48 --> 01:39:42.36
war plan. If no, it's Korea where to do something. But all we really do is try to prevent our

1108
01:39:42.36 --> 01:39:47.000
Marines from getting drunk and getting into the fights. And then we'll take them into, you know,

1109
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.60
Japan and go into Tokyo. We went into South Korea. And that's a six month deployment? Six months.

1110
01:39:52.60 --> 01:39:57.000
What number deployment was that for you? Five. Including one of those was a one year deployment.

1111
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.84
Yeah, one was a year, one was 10. Her body was seven. And then the first music six and the UDP was six.

1112
01:40:02.84 --> 01:40:07.64
So it all comes out to, I mean, about four years. Yeah, that was stuff up.

1113
01:40:09.80 --> 01:40:14.68
And then after that, what's next? Yeah, what's crazy too is with all those deployments. Like

1114
01:40:14.68 --> 01:40:20.44
that was middle of 15. Then I got promoted the major and I never deployed it. So quite honestly,

1115
01:40:20.44 --> 01:40:26.76
all of that one was through my captain time, which is even what made it crazy. And so I got promoted

1116
01:40:26.76 --> 01:40:32.36
to major. And the monitor at the time was actually the company commander of my puttune commander,

1117
01:40:32.36 --> 01:40:36.28
buddy, who got blown up a Romani guy's name was Eric Clark and I knew him real well.

1118
01:40:37.16 --> 01:40:43.16
And so we had a special relationship. And he had selected me for a place called PPNL. It's like

1119
01:40:43.16 --> 01:40:47.56
plans policies and orders. And in the Marine Corps, it's a very prestigious bullet. So it's like one

1120
01:40:47.56 --> 01:40:51.64
of those bullets. And if you do well, you can go on and be a general officer. So if you're a guy that

1121
01:40:51.64 --> 01:40:57.88
is playing the deep game like you described, like that's the job you want. And I, at this point,

1122
01:40:57.88 --> 01:41:01.64
I had decided it was going to be a career. So after three, two, I was like, this is, I'm going to go to

1123
01:41:01.64 --> 01:41:08.68
20. And I just had no desire to sit in a basement cubicle in the Pentagon and, you know,

1124
01:41:08.68 --> 01:41:13.72
design a new helmet or whatever, I was going to do it, I just couldn't do it. And like you said earlier,

1125
01:41:13.72 --> 01:41:18.76
like I loved teaching. And I loved idealistic young officer. So I asked him if I could go to the

1126
01:41:18.76 --> 01:41:24.12
basic school. And he obliged, because he had a lot of people that wanted to do PPNL. So he cut me

1127
01:41:24.12 --> 01:41:27.64
orders to the basic school. And you, I tell that story about I knew him, because it's not usually

1128
01:41:27.64 --> 01:41:32.04
that easy to just talk to your mother and say, no, I don't want that. I want this and have it work out.

1129
01:41:32.04 --> 01:41:36.52
But in that situation, it did. And so he got me orders to the basic school. And I got back from the

1130
01:41:36.52 --> 01:41:44.52
UDP in July of 15. And then I off cycle moved in October 15. And I bring that up just to say,

1131
01:41:44.52 --> 01:41:50.44
my kids and I have three kids at this point. They're the two older ones are in school. And I didn't

1132
01:41:50.44 --> 01:41:56.36
want to pull them out of school. So I actually geo-batched, so just again, more distance, right?

1133
01:41:56.36 --> 01:42:02.12
So get back from that deployment. And then I went and was living in a condo and DC and driving

1134
01:42:02.12 --> 01:42:07.000
back to North Carolina on the weekends for nine months until the following summer when I moved

1135
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.08
him up. All right. So the basic school this time, you're on the other side, watching people go through.

1136
01:42:13.08 --> 01:42:18.68
Is that a good to me? That sounds like a good loaning experience. Seeing people how they react

1137
01:42:19.80 --> 01:42:23.96
from a leadership perspective and from a psychological perspective. That's right. Yeah.

1138
01:42:24.76 --> 01:42:28.84
And it's great. The basic school is all taught by officers. So unlike school

1139
01:42:28.84 --> 01:42:33.64
of entry where the instructor is primarily enlisted at the basic school, the primary instructor is

1140
01:42:33.64 --> 01:42:38.36
the officer. So even as a major, they sent me through a pretty good training resident and I had to

1141
01:42:38.36 --> 01:42:43.000
get qualified to train every single thing. So it's like they have a different qualification for

1142
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.88
each subject that you attempt to teach. And so they do a really good job there. I got to be

1143
01:42:47.88 --> 01:42:52.60
the operations officer, a company commander, and the war fighting director, operations officer,

1144
01:42:52.60 --> 01:42:56.20
and war fighting director, typically Lieutenant Colonel Billets, but I just got the opportunity

1145
01:42:56.20 --> 01:43:01.48
because at that time they didn't have the Lieutenant Colonel's and they chose me to fill both

1146
01:43:01.48 --> 01:43:06.36
those Billets at different times. So my three-year tour there. So I mean, I really got a great run out of that.

1147
01:43:07.56 --> 01:43:12.92
And not to kind of like focus on this. You haven't really brought it up a little bit

1148
01:43:12.92 --> 01:43:19.88
but just to kind of because where this story ends up, your career is like going really well at this point.

1149
01:43:19.88 --> 01:43:24.84
Yeah, I mean, as you mentioned, you were the number one platoon commander. I didn't mention it as the

1150
01:43:24.84 --> 01:43:28.92
weapons company commander. I got submitted for the left-witch award, which is you know, the best company

1151
01:43:28.92 --> 01:43:32.76
commander in the Marine Corps. I didn't win obviously, but just to have my batang commander submit

1152
01:43:32.76 --> 01:43:37.000
me up through the regiment and division for that was an honor. And then yeah, at the basic school,

1153
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.24
like the monitor tried to send me to PPU, and gave me exactly what I wanted at the basic school.

1154
01:43:41.24 --> 01:43:46.52
Then when I got to the basic school, they made me the opso. I said, I'd brand new major, which is a

1155
01:43:46.52 --> 01:43:51.24
normally Lieutenant Colonel's Billet. And then I did a company commander tour and then it was a new

1156
01:43:51.24 --> 01:43:57.24
CO and then the new CO hand chosen me to be the warfighting director. And so yeah, I mean, I think I was very

1157
01:43:57.24 --> 01:44:02.84
competitive now. Well, your fit reps look in like this whole time. I'm all top. I mean, if we want to

1158
01:44:02.84 --> 01:44:08.28
skip forward the the judge in my case, it was like I've never seen a record. So example, exemplary

1159
01:44:08.28 --> 01:44:12.84
and also high marks. So there's an impartial guy that looked at my reports and it's like this is the

1160
01:44:12.84 --> 01:44:18.04
best I've ever seen. So but you got to keep in mind, like I said earlier at the basic school,

1161
01:44:18.04 --> 01:44:23.72
the best captains went to TBS or went to IOC. And when I was a TBS, I was a major. The best

1162
01:44:23.72 --> 01:44:28.76
of majors, don't always go to TBS, the best captains do. And so I was a little off track. And when

1163
01:44:28.76 --> 01:44:33.96
out the reason is coming out of Ramadi number one, I didn't have anyone that used to be in the

1164
01:44:33.96 --> 01:44:38.68
military. There's a lot of people in the military today. I think nepotism is prevalent, like

1165
01:44:38.68 --> 01:44:43.96
general sons or at least had a regimental father. And they they don't get a free pass, but they

1166
01:44:43.96 --> 01:44:48.76
understand the key billets that they need to go to. And they understand the relationships that

1167
01:44:48.76 --> 01:44:55.40
need to be harnessed and and developed. And so these small advantages in the beginning turn into

1168
01:44:55.40 --> 01:45:00.52
bigger advantages over time. So I guess my point is when I went to school of infantry as a young

1169
01:45:00.52 --> 01:45:06.60
captain, that didn't help me at all as a professional. And probably even going to Afghanistan

1170
01:45:06.60 --> 01:45:12.20
on an IA billet where I didn't get a report from a Marine didn't help me at all in terms of career

1171
01:45:12.20 --> 01:45:17.40
progression. So like that whole three years where it was very important to probably separate yourself.

1172
01:45:17.96 --> 01:45:24.92
I just didn't do it, but going into my three two company commander time because all those experiences

1173
01:45:24.92 --> 01:45:30.44
I had did make me a very effective leader. I was able to really shine as a company commander,

1174
01:45:30.44 --> 01:45:35.16
and those reports are really what stood me. Got me starting to separate from the pack and then

1175
01:45:35.16 --> 01:45:40.92
as a major at the basic school again, same thing. So in those six years it was like I think that's

1176
01:45:40.92 --> 01:45:45.24
when people started looking at my record and saying who's this guy. But I think most of my

1177
01:45:45.24 --> 01:45:50.44
other peers that there's a lot of peers that I have that are I will admit much better than me.

1178
01:45:50.44 --> 01:45:55.88
I mean smarter than me, more talented. And so I look at some of my peers and I'm just always impressed

1179
01:45:55.88 --> 01:46:00.04
and I just always you know one of us fired to be like somebody's guys, but some of those guys

1180
01:46:00.04 --> 01:46:05.56
were put on tracks early kind of hands-lected for things early that I just don't think anyone knew about

1181
01:46:05.56 --> 01:46:10.84
me until later in my career probably similar stories to OCS and TBS, right? I show up on day one

1182
01:46:10.84 --> 01:46:16.52
and I'm lost and by the end people are like, look this guy. Maybe he's not as lost as we thought he was.

1183
01:46:16.52 --> 01:46:25.32
I think my career is almost the same story. So you get done with being the

1184
01:46:25.32 --> 01:46:31.000
basic school instructor and then it's off to then it's that when you can win two Command and

1185
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.84
Staff College. Yep. Yep. And now so now you're in it to win it.

1186
01:46:34.84 --> 01:46:39.72
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Once I got to the basic school I was in it to win it. So yep, I went to

1187
01:46:39.72 --> 01:46:43.40
Command and Staff got selected for school and it was nice because I was already up in Kwanakus.

1188
01:46:43.40 --> 01:46:49.56
Is it hard to get selected for school? It's not. There's two things. One you got to be competitive.

1189
01:46:49.56 --> 01:46:55.96
So probably in the top 40% which really isn't that much but top 40% and then you have to be

1190
01:46:55.96 --> 01:47:01.32
the timing to make it. So there's a couple factors in place not always the best. Sometimes

1191
01:47:01.32 --> 01:47:05.48
it's just about timing. And how long is this? How long are you go there for?

1192
01:47:05.48 --> 01:47:11.56
Command and Staff's a year. A solid year and again now you're going to O time but you don't care at

1193
01:47:11.56 --> 01:47:15.48
this point because you're doing a career. Your wife's on board with doing a career. She loves

1194
01:47:15.48 --> 01:47:20.28
this stability. She's looking at retirement. Yep. She's like we're set for a life. She never said that.

1195
01:47:20.28 --> 01:47:25.64
I mean we're over selling it now. But yeah, she I mean kids are all in school now. So my

1196
01:47:25.64 --> 01:47:29.96
youngest is now in preschool. Three kids in school. They're still young enough that we want some

1197
01:47:29.96 --> 01:47:35.88
stability. And my goal actually was to go back to Lijon. So when I was there as a captain I had bought

1198
01:47:35.88 --> 01:47:41.08
a 50 acre piece of timberland that I've got four wheelers and stuff that I keep on it and then we

1199
01:47:41.08 --> 01:47:45.32
still own my house in Jacksonville. So I had two properties still in North Carolina when we

1200
01:47:45.32 --> 01:47:49.80
were up in DC. And so my goal after Command and Staff was to get back to North Carolina and just

1201
01:47:49.80 --> 01:47:57.000
remain there to retirement. And so that was kind of my play. Now some of the some of the more

1202
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.48
conflicted thoughts you had when you were in Ramadi, when you were in Afghanistan,

1203
01:48:04.28 --> 01:48:09.72
are you are you kind of just dealing with those as in like hey that's the way it is sometimes

1204
01:48:09.72 --> 01:48:13.64
you know I can do a good job. I can try and mitigate that stuff in the future. When you're at

1205
01:48:13.64 --> 01:48:18.92
Command and Staff College and you're talking about now more senior level strategic level things

1206
01:48:19.56 --> 01:48:24.52
are you having considerations around those things or you having discussions around those things.

1207
01:48:24.52 --> 01:48:29.48
Do you feel like you've sort of accepted that that's the way the system works and there's some

1208
01:48:29.48 --> 01:48:33.96
benefits to it and there's some negatives to it and you can as you get more senior you can focus more

1209
01:48:33.96 --> 01:48:40.76
on the benefits. Where are you at mentally? Yeah it's a great question. So at Command and Staff you

1210
01:48:40.76 --> 01:48:45.56
can do a masters. I think it's part of the curriculum now when I went through as a student it was

1211
01:48:45.56 --> 01:48:50.60
like an option. You didn't have to do it because it required extra classes and a thesis to

1212
01:48:50.60 --> 01:48:55.08
write on your own times so some people just wanted to downtime chose not to do it. But I wanted

1213
01:48:55.08 --> 01:49:03.96
the masters I wanted to challenge myself and most instructors there implore almost like they

1214
01:49:03.96 --> 01:49:11.08
drive you towards writing something about like the tactical level small squad unit level like

1215
01:49:11.08 --> 01:49:17.08
insightful novel idea. I wanted to write about foreign diplomacy and how it was broken.

1216
01:49:17.64 --> 01:49:21.64
And I had been working on the small tactical level at the basics school for three years. I was

1217
01:49:21.64 --> 01:49:25.56
the work fighting director for the year previous like there's probably no one more qualified

1218
01:49:25.56 --> 01:49:30.84
to write some type of thesis 20 page paper easily on how to do that but it just it didn't

1219
01:49:30.84 --> 01:49:37.000
interest me. And so I was reaching for foreign diplomacy. My instructors, my PhDs told me like

1220
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.08
every year there's so many that comes in here and talks about how the gold water nickels that

1221
01:49:41.08 --> 01:49:46.12
needs to be revamped and it's just the same old stuff and you know my counter to that was like

1222
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:50.76
well it hasn't fucking been fixed yet has it and that there's probably nothing more important

1223
01:49:50.76 --> 01:49:56.44
when we're still losing wars. And so despite all the pushback on it I wrote you're only supposed

1224
01:49:56.44 --> 01:50:03.08
to write 20 pages and the parameters of the paper were minimum of 20 papers no more than 80 pages.

1225
01:50:03.08 --> 01:50:08.84
So I wrote 65 pages like I just couldn't stop writing and I gave it to my instructors and they

1226
01:50:08.84 --> 01:50:13.08
just handed it back to me like immediately like 65 pages I'm not going to read this.

1227
01:50:13.08 --> 01:50:20.36
It's like you guys assign 80 pages a night of reading 80 pages a night. I just spent

1228
01:50:21.16 --> 01:50:26.36
months writing this and you can't even give me the time to say these parts of your

1229
01:50:26.36 --> 01:50:32.20
paper don't add value that you won't even like read it they're like make it less.

1230
01:50:32.20 --> 01:50:36.12
And so that's what I was up against. I was like I felt like as an officer I wanted to be

1231
01:50:36.12 --> 01:50:42.92
challenged academically and I just I didn't get it from the PhDs so I did I made it 30 pages

1232
01:50:42.92 --> 01:50:46.52
got my master's checking the box and then nobody ever read the paper again.

1233
01:50:46.52 --> 01:50:51.88
Did you learn any good information at Command and Staff Call? Was it helpful?

1234
01:50:51.88 --> 01:50:58.04
Oh yeah I do think the you know like if you're saying Command and Staff Call is a value and

1235
01:50:58.04 --> 01:51:03.72
a hundred percent the real question is could it be better and yeah it absolutely could be better but

1236
01:51:03.72 --> 01:51:08.52
there's it's always easier to find ways for it to be better. I think from like 30 years ago

1237
01:51:08.52 --> 01:51:11.88
what they have now is you know world's better and don't what we used to have like they have

1238
01:51:11.88 --> 01:51:16.84
small groups they facilitate good discussions they really challenged my thinking on the wars I mean we

1239
01:51:16.84 --> 01:51:23.72
went back it's like Frederick the Great and Prussia all the way through Napoleon and Civil War

1240
01:51:23.72 --> 01:51:28.28
and modern day and I think they did a really good job but they didn't go in it too deep onto

1241
01:51:28.28 --> 01:51:34.04
anything and they challenged me and like Henry Kissinger's book diplomacy I had never

1242
01:51:34.04 --> 01:51:39.40
opened it up and they really pulled a lot out of there that challenged me and I believe in realism

1243
01:51:39.40 --> 01:51:43.80
and I don't think American foreign diplomacy has really gotten to that level and it's been like

1244
01:51:43.80 --> 01:51:49.08
explored a little bit but again they just exposed me to a lot I think it's really incumbent upon

1245
01:51:49.08 --> 01:51:54.12
the student that wants their exposed to something to then really get the education on their own

1246
01:51:54.12 --> 01:51:58.36
and it takes independence to be able to do that if you just go through the motions of what the

1247
01:51:58.36 --> 01:52:05.24
school asks you'll get very little out of it. Was there any paradigm shifts in your fault while you were

1248
01:52:05.24 --> 01:52:14.68
there? No my problem in an education system is I always start to get a little frustrated because

1249
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:18.92
there's like a system to the education system and like if you haven't figured out about me I'd

1250
01:52:18.92 --> 01:52:23.16
like to challenge things and at a certain point people don't want to hear it and you just become

1251
01:52:23.16 --> 01:52:27.24
a pain in the ass and so there's like a line that it's different for every person every boss

1252
01:52:27.24 --> 01:52:31.88
I've ever had says I want honesty back what does that mean you like well I guess I'll find out

1253
01:52:31.88 --> 01:52:35.48
through trial and error of giving you honesty back and there's gonna be a certain point where

1254
01:52:35.48 --> 01:52:39.40
I'm gonna either read through your face or through your emotion or what you're saying to me that

1255
01:52:39.96 --> 01:52:44.20
I've gone too far and now I'm starting to annoy you and then that's when you know you got a back

1256
01:52:44.20 --> 01:52:49.56
off and so I always find myself in the small group discussions like I can dominate any conversation

1257
01:52:49.56 --> 01:52:52.60
with my opinions but there's a time where you've got to read the room and understand

1258
01:52:53.80 --> 01:52:57.96
you need to be a passive listener and so that was probably my struggle with it. I just felt like some

1259
01:52:57.96 --> 01:53:04.76
of my views went counter to what they were trying to teach and if I was to get to aggressive with

1260
01:53:04.76 --> 01:53:10.20
it it seemed to be counterproductive, vice-discussed and so a lot of it has to do with counter

1261
01:53:10.20 --> 01:53:16.60
certainty you know it's the same thing as it'd be us like I just the way you win the way you fight

1262
01:53:16.60 --> 01:53:22.04
a counter or the way you fight in an insurgency is to not get involved in an insurgency and that

1263
01:53:22.04 --> 01:53:27.48
requires deeper thought on the operational strategic levels and we've just celebrated these generals

1264
01:53:27.48 --> 01:53:31.72
for the last 20 years that have wrote the small wars, manuals or reinvented the small wars,

1265
01:53:31.72 --> 01:53:35.56
wars, manuals and counter-insurgency manuals and there's a time at place where we

1266
01:53:35.56 --> 01:53:39.16
is military tacticians need to understand how to do it absolutely 100% agree,

1267
01:53:39.16 --> 01:53:45.80
read all the books, got it but to just continue to engage them for multiple decades without

1268
01:53:45.80 --> 01:53:51.16
like real metrics of effectiveness or exit strategies, Afghanistan withdrawals just the perfect

1269
01:53:51.16 --> 01:53:56.04
example. I mean there couldn't be a better historical example of how that was just

1270
01:53:56.04 --> 01:54:02.36
terribly executed and it's just a symptom of a much larger problem and so a lot of these opinions

1271
01:54:02.36 --> 01:54:07.96
I had in command of staff solidified through my paper and you know I left there I told the story

1272
01:54:07.96 --> 01:54:12.36
about me handing the paper to the PhDs because that's just another example of like no one really

1273
01:54:12.36 --> 01:54:17.40
cared they were there to expose you to the things that they were exposed to but they didn't look at

1274
01:54:17.40 --> 01:54:21.80
like where Stoo Schiller was academically and say how do we get Stoo Schiller individually

1275
01:54:21.80 --> 01:54:25.96
to be more challenged and developed to where we need him to be and maybe they don't have the

1276
01:54:25.96 --> 01:54:31.000
bandwidth to do it but you know you look at the great military minds of history like

1277
01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.12
classwits he had a guy named Sean Horst that was a military professional that sat there and

1278
01:54:36.12 --> 01:54:42.20
and knew where classwits was met him there and then challenged him specifically and I just

1279
01:54:42.20 --> 01:54:52.20
I sometimes wish I had that so you wrap up at that school and then where you off to and then

1280
01:54:52.20 --> 01:54:56.92
I so I told the story if I wanted to get back to North Carolina so I told my monitor different

1281
01:54:56.92 --> 01:55:02.12
monitor now don't have a relationship with this guy and so I had seen them on two road shows

1282
01:55:02.12 --> 01:55:06.12
which is like yearly the monitors go around and you get an opportunity to shape what your

1283
01:55:06.12 --> 01:55:09.72
desires are going to be when you're a mover so I told them two years previous I went North

1284
01:55:09.72 --> 01:55:13.16
Carolina I don't care I don't know what's going on and no one really wants to campus you

1285
01:55:13.16 --> 01:55:16.92
and so usually when you say campus you know it's like all right you got it but you know I

1286
01:55:16.92 --> 01:55:21.80
had spent my whole time in campus you and Quonico I'd never been out to the West Coast or anywhere else

1287
01:55:21.80 --> 01:55:25.72
and so I knew there was a chance that the Marine Corps was going to start to say no brother you

1288
01:55:25.72 --> 01:55:30.68
you've you've homesteaded too long so then I saw him the year before or same thing and so he said

1289
01:55:30.68 --> 01:55:35.48
all right I'll tell you what's to if it's not North Carolina I'll call you and keep in mind I didn't

1290
01:55:35.48 --> 01:55:40.36
do my observability based on that story I told and as a major you gotta do what's called key

1291
01:55:40.36 --> 01:55:44.76
billet and burn infantry officer that's up so our exo so coming out of command staff they're like

1292
01:55:44.76 --> 01:55:52.04
you have to be an exo to remain competitive and so I mean everybody got orders in like January

1293
01:55:52.04 --> 01:55:57.80
February March I mean I got to like the end of March we're talking like you're gonna move in June

1294
01:55:57.80 --> 01:56:02.44
and I still haven't even talked to this guy like all the school registration is in like January

1295
01:56:02.44 --> 01:56:06.44
my wife's asking me every day and I'm like you know I don't know to tell you babe I don't

1296
01:56:06.44 --> 01:56:11.48
so I finally because I knew this guy's real busy but finally I just broke down and I called him

1297
01:56:11.48 --> 01:56:17.32
and I was like hey man in a march everyone in my command staff classes orders except for me you told

1298
01:56:17.32 --> 01:56:20.76
me you would call me if it wasn't campals June so I'm assuming I'm still going in the campals

1299
01:56:20.76 --> 01:56:27.32
June and can you confirm and he he's like no campals June's filled he's like the good news

1300
01:56:27.32 --> 01:56:34.28
we have availability and 29 palms are San Diego and I want you back so I got to the phone with them

1301
01:56:34.28 --> 01:56:40.68
I'm I'm in no exact where I was I was at Panera and I was still writing my masters thesis at the time so I was like

1302
01:56:40.68 --> 01:56:47.000
I used to go to Panera just right and so I'm sitting in Panera just mad and I'm thinking about all the

1303
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.64
property I got North Carolina and how like I'd been telling my wife it would be North Carolina for two years now

1304
01:56:51.64 --> 01:56:58.68
so I wrote them an email email a little bit easier for me to not be as emotional because I can kind of edit it

1305
01:56:59.08 --> 01:57:03.64
and I wrote but I want to put in writing now so hey man I'm putting this in and writing for you

1306
01:57:04.20 --> 01:57:09.96
I'm gonna forgo keybill it there's got to be a sexual assault officer or some other thing in North Carolina

1307
01:57:09.96 --> 01:57:16.92
that you can give me it's in writing make it happen and I had sand and like you know you gotta understand like how

1308
01:57:16.92 --> 01:57:21.80
scary it is to do something like that because I essentially said my career's over in Panera

1309
01:57:22.36 --> 01:57:26.92
but I wanted North Carolina and so then he called me back and said this is what he said

1310
01:57:27.56 --> 01:57:32.52
he said I got your email I'm gonna give you exactly what you want and then he hung up

1311
01:57:32.52 --> 01:57:38.20
oh my god I was like oh man yeah I'm gonna be the sexual assault officers like in

1312
01:57:38.20 --> 01:57:42.60
rain division like this is and I'm gonna have to go back and look at all my peers and they're all

1313
01:57:42.60 --> 01:57:46.28
gonna talk about where they're going to be botanics those or botanian offsets or wherever and I'm

1314
01:57:46.28 --> 01:57:51.96
gonna have to tell them what crap job I just got because I did to myself and I know what he did

1315
01:57:51.96 --> 01:57:55.96
then because the monitor has two responsibilities he's got a responsibility to the Marine Corps

1316
01:57:55.96 --> 01:58:00.68
he's got a responsibility to use person and the monitor's job responsibility to Marine Corps is to

1317
01:58:00.68 --> 01:58:05.48
keep competitive officers competitive so then he went he didn't know me from Adam so after that

1318
01:58:05.48 --> 01:58:09.56
he went through my record and as he was going through my record he probably came to the realization

1319
01:58:09.56 --> 01:58:15.48
like shit this guy's pretty good if I bury him in a staff job in secondary division then I end his

1320
01:58:15.48 --> 01:58:19.80
career and he had a responsibility to keep me competitive but he also knew that I had like dug my

1321
01:58:19.80 --> 01:58:23.88
heels in and I wasn't going to California without like probably you know screaming at top of the

1322
01:58:23.88 --> 01:58:29.32
mountain so he was in like a new one situation and so that's how I ended up at Marseille so he

1323
01:58:29.32 --> 01:58:35.96
wasn't advertising a Marseille support paty and exo and he had that kind of hidden on the shelf and so

1324
01:58:35.96 --> 01:58:40.20
he called me back and he was like hey I've got a Marseille support paty and exo they're actually

1325
01:58:40.20 --> 01:58:44.76
asking for infantry officers I haven't made a public it's not really keybill but maybe it is

1326
01:58:44.76 --> 01:58:48.52
kind because it's still baty and exo just not an infantry batty and he's like would you be interested in that

1327
01:58:48.52 --> 01:58:53.000
I was like fuck yeah I don't care a lot of Marseille I'm fucking this all worked out thank you you know

1328
01:58:53.40 --> 01:59:02.28
and so that's how it happened and so I took second Marine's MRSB Marine Raider support paty and

1329
01:59:02.28 --> 01:59:07.40
so it was called and so the way it works is Marseille's got three battyans and then they have three

1330
01:59:07.40 --> 01:59:12.60
support patyans the support patyans have their logistics common in tomorrins and they basically just

1331
01:59:12.60 --> 01:59:19.24
do a six month workup just in the MRSB and then they aggregate them to the MRB unit and then they

1332
01:59:19.24 --> 01:59:23.40
do six more months and then so it's like a full year of training and then they deploy as that aggregate

1333
01:59:23.40 --> 01:59:28.28
team and I was the exo so all I did was facilitate the teams on their timeline but I was only there for a

1334
01:59:28.28 --> 01:59:33.40
year so quite on a sandwich saw like one full cycle and then other cycles in the state of

1335
01:59:33.40 --> 01:59:39.32
the day. Did you go on deployment or no? So while I was there because they only have three

1336
01:59:39.32 --> 01:59:44.36
battyans commanders and so they actually the battyans commanders of the support patyans are actually

1337
01:59:44.36 --> 01:59:50.04
baged Marseille guys and so they have in that sense they have six battyans commander so Marseille

1338
01:59:50.04 --> 01:59:56.04
has at any time six commands selected battyans commanders and so the so-to-down range they have

1339
01:59:56.04 --> 02:00:03.24
a cycle of when those guys go down there and control command that unit they actually while I was the

1340
02:00:03.24 --> 02:00:07.56
exo took my battyans commander to be in charge of the so-to-f so he doesn't deploy with the battyans

1341
02:00:07.56 --> 02:00:11.48
he only to deploy so it's like maybe five key guys and then some other people from across the

1342
02:00:11.48 --> 02:00:16.36
regiment so I was essentially the battyans commander for majority of the time while I was back there

1343
02:00:16.36 --> 02:00:24.52
but I never deployed so I just sat there in courthouse bed with my battyans his battyans but I was

1344
02:00:24.52 --> 02:00:30.60
acting and it was really it was a good time I truly enjoyed it and why was that bill on me a year?

1345
02:00:32.20 --> 02:00:35.72
Because I got selected Lieutenant Colonel yeah good question I would have stayed in Marseille until

1346
02:00:35.72 --> 02:00:41.24
they until I retired to be quite honest with you but I got selected to Lieutenant Colonel and I

1347
02:00:41.24 --> 02:00:45.48
actually went to the vampire meetings those acting co and the exo and in the vampire meetings so

1348
02:00:45.48 --> 02:00:49.80
I got hurt from the horses mouth they're like we don't have we're filled up with Lieutenant

1349
02:00:49.80 --> 02:00:55.16
Colonel's at her badge like we can't accept any non-bad Lieutenant Colonel so you got to go kid

1350
02:00:55.96 --> 02:01:01.48
so I was your wife during that year was everything going cool there yeah if she was kind of stoked

1351
02:01:01.48 --> 02:01:06.12
she's in North Carolina and we had a we had a sweet spot then you know once we got back

1352
02:01:06.12 --> 02:01:12.20
to North Carolina we were in our house it was familiar territory I was happy with my job at Marseille

1353
02:01:12.20 --> 02:01:16.92
kids are in school now it's just a little bit of like sanity yeah I mean it was good thanks for

1354
02:01:16.92 --> 02:01:20.44
good on the home front at that point and so then what happens when you make Lieutenant Colonel where

1355
02:01:20.44 --> 02:01:24.60
do they send you so I mean I knew I got I found out I got selected in like October so I

1356
02:01:24.60 --> 02:01:28.20
don't even have Marseille for like three months so like within three months to take in the job I was

1357
02:01:28.20 --> 02:01:35.88
looking for the next job and so I had some buddies that were up in division second-bring division

1358
02:01:35.88 --> 02:01:39.72
which was still local and so I basically started putting out dealers and I was like hey I'm going to

1359
02:01:39.72 --> 02:01:46.28
have to move um I'll take a staff job up there got my exo job being the exo at a Marseille support

1360
02:01:46.28 --> 02:01:49.80
potenti so I don't need to keep building more I don't think so if you could if you guys could

1361
02:01:49.80 --> 02:01:55.56
take me out appreciate it and then I finished the year at Marseille and that in that spring

1362
02:01:55.56 --> 02:02:03.40
the chief of staff of Marseille so an o6 talked to the chief of staff of the division who is

1363
02:02:03.40 --> 02:02:08.36
an o6 the chief of staff both of those gentlemen are generals now actually and between that

1364
02:02:08.36 --> 02:02:13.64
conversation they decided to make me the six Marines up so I don't know how that shook out

1365
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.52
I don't know if it was because they just thought I was that talented or because I had

1366
02:02:18.52 --> 02:02:21.64
done keep building an infantry battalion that they wanted to give me the regimental

1367
02:02:21.64 --> 02:02:27.72
opso to make me more of a career that's right but either way I mean pretty important job

1368
02:02:27.72 --> 02:02:31.72
there's only two regiments in the division to be the operations officer of one of them was a

1369
02:02:31.72 --> 02:02:35.32
big deal so I then I did that for the next year before I was selected to batani command

1370
02:02:35.32 --> 02:02:39.56
and then what happened once you got batani command so I got selected to batani command

1371
02:02:41.56 --> 02:02:46.20
shortly after getting to the regimental opso job so but the regimental opso job just to pan

1372
02:02:46.20 --> 02:02:52.12
picture going into the story we're about to tell I mean it was the Marseille job was awesome

1373
02:02:52.12 --> 02:03:01.56
fulfilling manageable hours good work the regimental opso job was like 20 hour days we spent two

1374
02:03:01.56 --> 02:03:06.44
months at an ITX which is in the Mojave Desert where it is just expected that like I don't

1375
02:03:06.44 --> 02:03:10.92
eat I have tobacco and I just drink energy drinks like it's almost like I'm looked down upon

1376
02:03:10.92 --> 02:03:16.76
if that's not how I conduct myself and it just it took a lot out of me and my boss was

1377
02:03:18.84 --> 02:03:24.52
not very appreciative most of the time and I got into some like this was kind of at the point

1378
02:03:24.52 --> 02:03:30.84
of my career where I started really pushing back so like as a as a first lieutenant as a exo

1379
02:03:30.84 --> 02:03:35.64
and a body with my batani commander was kind of verbally and even at times physically abusive like

1380
02:03:35.64 --> 02:03:41.000
just kind of took it and in my head was like this is wrong but as a regimental opso as a 40-year-old

1381
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:49.56
man if you start telling me like I'm gonna I'm gonna what do you say I'm gonna fucking fill a you

1382
02:03:49.56 --> 02:03:55.16
I'm gonna fucking cut you in half that's when I'm like bitch fucking come bring it we're fucking

1383
02:03:55.16 --> 02:04:00.92
gonna do you know like these are the conversations we would have and it's it's like dangerous right

1384
02:04:00.92 --> 02:04:05.56
because and I had these with multiple of sexes like I don't know what it is about regimental commanders

1385
02:04:05.56 --> 02:04:11.88
but they they just felt like they could talk to me like like I was a piece of shit and I just got

1386
02:04:11.88 --> 02:04:16.52
to a place in my life in my career I just wouldn't be talked to like that and so it created this

1387
02:04:16.52 --> 02:04:23.24
unhealthy tension and then when I would push back on some of these conversations you would think that

1388
02:04:23.24 --> 02:04:33.32
after like a couple days it would actually be like a steam release but it almost like it almost was

1389
02:04:33.32 --> 02:04:38.28
like seen as a threat and it would almost increase the pressure where then they would come back

1390
02:04:38.28 --> 02:04:44.52
and want to like reassert dominance which would then want to cause me to like reassert like fuck you

1391
02:04:45.32 --> 02:04:50.60
and it just became unhealthy and everyone could see it and so you just gotta understand that like

1392
02:04:50.60 --> 02:04:55.88
that's what I came out of after a year of just being overworked to like almost like fist fighting

1393
02:04:55.88 --> 02:05:03.24
a couple times and then going into my batank of energy so you you're you're having clashes with

1394
02:05:03.24 --> 02:05:10.68
regimental commander oh yeah and as this is happening are you think yourself like all right

1395
02:05:10.68 --> 02:05:15.000
maybe I need to maneuver a little bit here you know I spent a bunch of time at expeditionary

1396
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.28
warfresh cool learning about maneuver warfare and not to attack you know hardened positions

1397
02:05:20.28 --> 02:05:29.08
head on and here I am engaging in verbal battles with my boss yeah do you ever think like well

1398
02:05:29.08 --> 02:05:39.48
maybe I should have taken a different tact so when you have certain people or certain

1399
02:05:39.48 --> 02:05:47.56
expectations so you can just not push back and try and do it in our full way but

1400
02:05:47.56 --> 02:05:53.24
that type of person is still going to expect you to work 22 hour days and be unappreciative

1401
02:05:53.24 --> 02:05:57.32
when you do get the bus dress to get the product to them and then they're the follow-up

1402
02:05:57.32 --> 02:06:04.20
question once you finally get that product is where's the next product and so sometimes you get a

1403
02:06:04.20 --> 02:06:10.84
boss that just no matter what you do whether it's soft diplomacy or whether it's verbal fighting

1404
02:06:10.84 --> 02:06:15.96
back you're just not going to probably change that person so the point you're making is like

1405
02:06:15.96 --> 02:06:20.52
pick your battles and be smart but the point I'm making is at a certain point in my life

1406
02:06:21.32 --> 02:06:27.64
I just refused to be talked to a certain way and so was that good for my career was I could

1407
02:06:27.64 --> 02:06:32.76
from my mental health I don't know but like I just I kind of solidified who I was what I was

1408
02:06:32.76 --> 02:06:36.84
capable of and how I was going to be treated and I was the bottom on and I had certain values

1409
02:06:36.84 --> 02:06:40.28
that I wasn't going to compromise and I didn't care what I meant for my career I mean I've got a

1410
02:06:40.28 --> 02:06:44.44
couple stories where like I basically tried to throw my career away a couple times because I was

1411
02:06:44.44 --> 02:06:49.000
like this is important to me like this is important to me and you know you can think about what you

1412
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.36
want but when I think something is right like I just don't back away from that. What kind of thing

1413
02:06:54.36 --> 02:07:00.20
would you put your kind of you know draw a line in the sand on? In terms of like regimental

1414
02:07:00.20 --> 02:07:07.24
commander were like you know what I'm done with this. There was one time there's one time at

1415
02:07:07.24 --> 02:07:14.60
ITX and so um the culminating event and on in the service for the Marine Corps at ITX is called

1416
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:25.80
MWX move forward for exercise and one regiment gets two battions and then one battion given hyper-enabled

1417
02:07:25.80 --> 02:07:30.76
capabilities it's free force on force now it's supposed to be free but there's a lot of rules that

1418
02:07:30.76 --> 02:07:35.24
almost drive this skibba maneuver but I mean it's the closest thing we get in terms of like I

1419
02:07:35.24 --> 02:07:42.60
as a regimental officer with two battions with LAR with artillery and with a whole exercise force

1420
02:07:42.60 --> 02:07:48.76
that determines who got killed and who doesn't get the build a plan but it's also like high stress

1421
02:07:48.76 --> 02:07:56.52
and so most of our COC was back in the rear where I thought the regimental commander should have been

1422
02:07:57.08 --> 02:08:03.96
but old generals and kernels think that they need to lead from the front and in doing so actually

1423
02:08:03.96 --> 02:08:09.40
probably put a lot more risk on the system and they're not comfortable sitting back in a COC

1424
02:08:09.40 --> 02:08:15.08
that has probably the capabilities that we need and so what that caused was him coming out with

1425
02:08:15.08 --> 02:08:21.48
a forward capability that I had and in signature management when you're trying to like not turn

1426
02:08:21.48 --> 02:08:27.64
on certain things or turn them on in a systematic way that disguises your digital footprint

1427
02:08:27.64 --> 02:08:34.28
he and I were sitting in this tiny little COC that I made out of the back of a trailer

1428
02:08:34.28 --> 02:08:37.80
and it was just one of those situations where I got like six computers I'm typing on all of them

1429
02:08:37.80 --> 02:08:42.20
I'm trying to control the tying up so there's different LAR platoons I'm trying to worry about

1430
02:08:42.20 --> 02:08:46.44
my signature management and he's yelling at me to do something and I'm like quickly answering

1431
02:08:46.44 --> 02:08:51.08
him while trying to do all these different things and there was just like one situation where

1432
02:08:51.08 --> 02:08:58.36
he snapped started screaming for an everyone and I looked at him and that was a situation like

1433
02:08:58.36 --> 02:09:01.48
here time I'm going to move around for a while I didn't say anything I just walked out

1434
02:09:02.20 --> 02:09:08.60
this is like I'm we're gonna fight so I walked out I took like 20 minutes and I came back in and

1435
02:09:08.60 --> 02:09:14.84
he like hey up so like maybe you should just chill and get some sleep and that was his way of saying

1436
02:09:14.84 --> 02:09:19.24
like maybe he went too far like trying to offer me some sleep and of course I'm

1437
02:09:19.24 --> 02:09:23.16
just stubborn I might know I don't need sleep I'm just fine and like I talked to some of my

1438
02:09:23.16 --> 02:09:26.92
guys after he did it in front of everyone and go my guys were like I can't believe you didn't hit him

1439
02:09:26.92 --> 02:09:30.28
like I can't believe you had the balls to just walk away like I wouldn't have done that

1440
02:09:30.68 --> 02:09:33.56
so there were times but I guess I'm just giving those examples because it's like

1441
02:09:34.60 --> 02:09:39.32
man it's just you're exhausting me so it is what it is

1442
02:09:41.72 --> 02:09:48.36
so you're in that job as the regimental officer operations officer when the Afghanist and withdraw

1443
02:09:48.36 --> 02:09:55.72
was down is that right yeah so another relevant piece of the story is 8th Marines we used to have

1444
02:09:55.72 --> 02:10:02.60
three regiments in the division and 8th Marines dissolved and so 1-8 actually got aggregated into 6

1445
02:10:02.60 --> 02:10:07.88
Marines so I was the regimental officer that took 1-8 re aggregated them and then made sure they

1446
02:10:07.88 --> 02:10:11.24
had all the supplies that they needed to go out on deployment so like I was working with their

1447
02:10:11.24 --> 02:10:16.84
opso and exo like on the daily so I was very familiar with that unit that got on the mute

1448
02:10:16.84 --> 02:10:22.44
that ultimately responded to the Kabul incident and so that's part of it right one eight

1449
02:10:22.44 --> 02:10:25.80
was my first unit if you remember remember my best friend I hit with the suicide vest and then one

1450
02:10:25.80 --> 02:10:30.12
eight was in my regiment that eyes the opso kind of man trained in equipped as much as the higher

1451
02:10:30.12 --> 02:10:35.000
headquarters does to send them out on that deployment and then I was selected to batank a man so

1452
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.24
in June I went over to school of infantry and took advanced infantry training batank and that was

1453
02:10:39.24 --> 02:10:45.72
in like mid June and you know August 26th is when the the S.V.S.T attack occurred so in June

1454
02:10:45.72 --> 02:10:50.52
you were going to school you went to school no I I commanded a batank that was at a school so it's

1455
02:10:50.52 --> 02:10:55.80
called an advanced infantry training batank and so that's the place where if you want to go

1456
02:10:55.80 --> 02:10:59.24
to sniper school if you want to go through advanced squad later school if you want to go through

1457
02:10:59.24 --> 02:11:04.12
advanced mortar school all the advanced infantry schools are housed under that instructor

1458
02:11:04.12 --> 02:11:12.52
cadre of the batank that I commanded all right so just to get into Afghanistan a little bit

1459
02:11:12.52 --> 02:11:15.88
just to get well not to get into a little bit but to put some context around it

1460
02:11:17.48 --> 02:11:23.56
February 2020 Trump makes a conditional deal with the Taliban that we're going to withdraw

1461
02:11:25.48 --> 02:11:32.44
September 2020 the Afghan government the Taliban hold talks in Doha the talks break down

1462
02:11:33.08 --> 02:11:38.36
they they're not making any progress but America still continues this withdrawal plan

1463
02:11:38.36 --> 02:11:48.60
February 2021 U.S. and Afghan government officials warn everyone that the Taliban is not

1464
02:11:48.60 --> 02:11:53.32
abiding with the agreements they're they're doing offensive things they're making maneuvers

1465
02:11:54.92 --> 02:12:01.48
April 14th Biden changes the withdrawal deadline from May 1st to September 11th

1466
02:12:01.48 --> 02:12:08.52
which is let's face it you don't pick the dates of September 11th out of a hat there's

1467
02:12:08.52 --> 02:12:16.12
a you know some kind of a symbolic gesture that that the Biden-ministrated administration wanted

1468
02:12:16.12 --> 02:12:24.76
which is hey September 11th this things over April 15th the Taliban says up you guys

1469
02:12:24.76 --> 02:12:27.56
re-nigged on what you said you were going to do you said you're going to drop by May now you're

1470
02:12:27.56 --> 02:12:35.64
saying September we're going to take countermeasures May the Taliban start doing exactly what they said

1471
02:12:35.64 --> 02:12:42.20
they start increasing attacks increasing in scale their attacks increasing in frequency their attacks

1472
02:12:43.80 --> 02:12:51.80
June 6th U.S. contractors begin pulling out and when you pull out contractors now the Afghan

1473
02:12:51.80 --> 02:12:55.80
forces and this is where you really start to see some of the problems that are going to

1474
02:12:55.80 --> 02:13:00.52
occur when you pull out these American contractors that take care of gear and supply

1475
02:13:01.48 --> 02:13:07.96
replacement gear all of a sudden all that's gone and this includes you know vehicles

1476
02:13:09.16 --> 02:13:15.16
planes aircraft drones helicopter everything that they've got all of a sudden they don't have the

1477
02:13:15.16 --> 02:13:25.24
capacity or the know how to keep it to keep it running July 1st America closes

1478
02:13:25.88 --> 02:13:34.76
Bogram airfield like in a really kind of weird way of just leaving just kind of up and left without

1479
02:13:34.76 --> 02:13:38.12
telling anyone didn't even tell the Afghan that that was going to happen the Afghan government that was

1480
02:13:38.12 --> 02:13:46.68
going to happen just did it and by the way the bag room Bogram is you know is a great logistics hub

1481
02:13:46.68 --> 02:13:52.76
it's a big massive airfield to well supplied well supported how long has it been there for 20 years

1482
02:13:52.76 --> 02:13:59.32
you know 19 years some incredible amount of time so it's an relatively secure area fully functional

1483
02:13:59.32 --> 02:14:07.48
and we just kind of leave it July 8th Biden says he's confidently the ability of the Afghan

1484
02:14:07.48 --> 02:14:17.32
military to ward off the Taliban and fight the Taliban and defeat the Taliban July 23rd the

1485
02:14:17.32 --> 02:14:28.84
Taliban starts applying pressure President Ghani is now not just asking but almost a begging for

1486
02:14:28.84 --> 02:14:37.24
US assistance there's a conversation that that Biden had with Ghani and he says and I don't know

1487
02:14:37.24 --> 02:14:41.24
if I'll nail the quote but he's saying that the perception is in the world that things aren't going

1488
02:14:41.24 --> 02:14:45.88
well and Biden says hey whether it's going well or not we need to project a different picture

1489
02:14:49.56 --> 02:14:55.88
August 6th Taliban takes full control of their first province and now this is in direct

1490
02:14:55.88 --> 02:15:04.68
violation of what they said they would do in the deal with America August 15th Taliban takes control

1491
02:15:04.68 --> 02:15:11.72
of Bogram no resistance they just walk in there there's a prison there they free a bunch of these

1492
02:15:11.72 --> 02:15:18.04
high-level prisoners from various anti-Afghan government and anti-American forces

1493
02:15:18.04 --> 02:15:27.08
they also enter Kabul that day President Ghani flees bail out apparently with a bunch of money

1494
02:15:27.08 --> 02:15:32.92
and I will never get over the irony of the fact that President Ghani was this kind of academic

1495
02:15:32.92 --> 02:15:38.92
individual that had written a book called Fixing Failed States a framework for rebuilding a fractured

1496
02:15:38.92 --> 02:15:50.28
world and in that book he uses examples like Oregon the state of Oregon in America a first world

1497
02:15:50.28 --> 02:15:56.04
country and that's how he talks about using examples of how to how to fix failed states

1498
02:15:59.24 --> 02:16:04.60
August 16th Biden comes on and says yeah well you know the Afghan military's fallen apart because

1499
02:16:04.60 --> 02:16:12.68
they're covered and their political leaders are weak August 17th Allied governments complaining about

1500
02:16:14.12 --> 02:16:19.64
the lack of communication and coordination from America so they start their own rescue missions

1501
02:16:19.64 --> 02:16:24.12
and we're hearing a lot about that August 23rd the director of the CIA

1502
02:16:26.44 --> 02:16:33.16
William Burns meets with the Taliban leader with Bardar to discuss the evacuation

1503
02:16:33.16 --> 02:16:41.000
so we're trying to sort of save what we can piece together some kind of an extraction plan

1504
02:16:43.72 --> 02:16:47.08
that's on August 23rd on August 26th suicide attack

1505
02:16:49.24 --> 02:16:58.28
11 Marines one soldier one navy corpsman killed the Marines apparently

1506
02:16:58.28 --> 02:17:06.04
they they there are reports that they knew that this attack was coming there's even some sources

1507
02:17:07.24 --> 02:17:12.68
that say that the Marines were saying hey we got to put up a stronger perimeter we got to push the

1508
02:17:12.68 --> 02:17:21.72
perimeter out and they got told no so that happens that's on August 26th and that is when you

1509
02:17:21.72 --> 02:17:29.72
reach the point where you felt you needed to speak up about that yeah a couple other

1510
02:17:30.36 --> 02:17:35.80
events in that timeline from a least my perspective so as the service members were watching

1511
02:17:35.80 --> 02:17:42.12
all that playout real time in social media on the news everybody was getting very upset

1512
02:17:42.12 --> 02:17:48.68
rightfully so so one day you didn't mention was 17 or 18 August the common out of the Marine Corps

1513
02:17:48.68 --> 02:17:54.84
released a white letter that said hey I know a lot of you are struggling but I want you to know

1514
02:17:54.84 --> 02:17:59.88
your sacrifices were worth it and if your struggling go see the therapist you can go go that's

1515
02:17:59.88 --> 02:18:06.84
I just summarized the whole thing and I read that and thought this guy doesn't get it so

1516
02:18:06.84 --> 02:18:12.04
reason people are upset is not because they think their sacrifices are worth it the reason

1517
02:18:12.04 --> 02:18:17.48
they're upset is because the leaders have failed in this withdrawal and that is undermining

1518
02:18:17.48 --> 02:18:23.64
all their sacrifices and he didn't address that at all in a hand wave of going to the therapist

1519
02:18:23.64 --> 02:18:30.12
is not good enough so you can understand like I read that and it just just kind of started eating

1520
02:18:30.12 --> 02:18:39.96
at me and then the other thing that you have to know is I've heard from the generals without naming

1521
02:18:39.96 --> 02:18:47.24
names I've heard this story many times following Vietnam there's two common ones coming out

1522
02:18:47.24 --> 02:18:52.44
Wilson and coming out barrow and what they did was and this is what's told today

1523
02:18:52.44 --> 02:18:59.64
fix the service they focused on cleaning up the draft class the drug users and making sure they

1524
02:18:59.64 --> 02:19:05.80
could fix the failures from Vietnam never does anyone talk about the operation on strategic

1525
02:19:05.80 --> 02:19:11.16
failures that occurred at the general officer level at Vietnam that never got addressed and was

1526
02:19:11.16 --> 02:19:16.76
happening right now in the at least the Marine Corps with the shift in the tactical focus and I

1527
02:19:16.76 --> 02:19:21.96
understand I think there's actually a lot of utility in the new force design but what we didn't

1528
02:19:21.96 --> 02:19:26.92
do was take a knee and address the operational and strategic failures that happened in our

1529
02:19:26.92 --> 02:19:31.88
last two decades and I feel like the narrative is going to be told again that the generals

1530
02:19:31.88 --> 02:19:36.92
had to fix the service because this current GWT generation isn't capable of fighting on the

1531
02:19:36.92 --> 02:19:42.36
tactical level so I'm struggling with these two problems like senior leadership isn't addressing

1532
02:19:42.36 --> 02:19:48.44
the failures and I have a couple examples of that and then yes that takes us to August 26 I'm

1533
02:19:48.44 --> 02:19:54.60
sitting in my office as a batai in commander and I I'm literally I have people texting me pictures

1534
02:19:54.60 --> 02:19:59.08
of the Marines that had gotten killed so like I'm finding out like within minutes that's the

1535
02:19:59.08 --> 02:20:05.32
gossip on the inside the company commander for all the Marines that got killed was one of my

1536
02:20:05.32 --> 02:20:11.40
SPCs at TBS meaning he was one of the one of the one of the potential commanders not in SPC he was

1537
02:20:11.40 --> 02:20:18.20
a teacher at TBS I knew Jeff Ball real well and I knew some of the Marines so and I have this

1538
02:20:18.20 --> 02:20:22.76
long history with one eight so there's just there was no one where it was more personal too than

1539
02:20:22.76 --> 02:20:31.64
I felt like myself in that moment and so I sat there in my chair and thought I don't think senior

1540
02:20:31.64 --> 02:20:36.44
leaders get it I don't think they understand the failures all these conversations about how well

1541
02:20:36.44 --> 02:20:42.60
it's going I can't think in military history at least over the last 30 or 40 years where there has

1542
02:20:42.60 --> 02:20:49.80
been such a monumental failure and not one person has acknowledged it and I just knew with certainty

1543
02:20:49.80 --> 02:20:53.72
that following this event no one was going to be held accountable like I had enough experience

1544
02:20:53.72 --> 02:21:00.52
and education to be able to foresee they're going to wash right past this and you can't make up

1545
02:21:00.52 --> 02:21:08.28
for the lives that were lost but we can absolutely get ahead and prevent the next stupid decision

1546
02:21:08.28 --> 02:21:13.000
by starting the whole people accountable and I felt the way to do that was through what I wanted

1547
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:16.92
to be just the one video like I did not plan it to be anything other than that I thought I'll make

1548
02:21:16.92 --> 02:21:22.20
one video I'll explain some of the things that I think they should have done and I'm going to demand

1549
02:21:22.20 --> 02:21:27.24
accountability because that's what I think we deserve because we're missing it and so that was

1550
02:21:27.24 --> 02:21:32.84
what led to that first video and even after I made it like I I articulate in that first video

1551
02:21:32.84 --> 02:21:37.96
that I knew I was potentially going to lose my job my retirement my family stability like

1552
02:21:37.96 --> 02:21:42.60
obviously I had thought through that articulated it in the video and even after I made the video

1553
02:21:42.60 --> 02:21:47.32
I didn't post it right away I went back to my house and was like pacing deciding whether or not

1554
02:21:47.32 --> 02:21:51.64
to hit post because I knew as soon as I hit the button it was going to change the trajectory of my life

1555
02:21:51.64 --> 02:22:01.72
but again I spent my whole adult life experiencing studying thinking living this and I just got to

1556
02:22:01.72 --> 02:22:05.80
a place where I didn't think anyone else was going to say it I felt the need to say it

1557
02:22:09.64 --> 02:22:15.000
videos about I think it's about four and a half minutes long something like that

1558
02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:22.52
you're in your canmies so that's something so you're you're definitely not shine away from who you are

1559
02:22:23.64 --> 02:22:28.60
you you know you stay you but you say in the video you've been in the Marine Corps for 17 years

1560
02:22:29.32 --> 02:22:33.80
and one thing that I reflected when I saw the video for the first time is I thought to myself oh

1561
02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:40.76
your entire career we'd been at war you know I spent more than half my career we weren't at war

1562
02:22:40.76 --> 02:22:46.84
you know we were in the 90s the dry years but I'm thinking man this guy's been in the Marine Corps

1563
02:22:46.84 --> 02:22:53.24
for 17 years the Marine Corps and America's been at war for that entire time you as you mentioned

1564
02:22:53.24 --> 02:22:58.04
you said you know you got a lot to lose you know what could happen you knew you were risking

1565
02:22:58.04 --> 02:23:04.44
your baton command you know family stability the whole nine yards you bring up that letter from the

1566
02:23:04.44 --> 02:23:12.92
commandant that he wrote and you know you mentioned did anyone throw their rank on the table

1567
02:23:12.92 --> 02:23:19.40
and say we shouldn't give a boggerman which again you know going back to the the silent five

1568
02:23:19.40 --> 02:23:25.72
which is what McMaster called the the Joint Chiefs of Staff that work for LBJ and you can

1569
02:23:25.72 --> 02:23:29.40
even hear you know that I've read in the beginning of guys that reflected back and said

1570
02:23:29.40 --> 02:23:38.20
I should have said something I should have stood up you talk about the fact that

1571
02:23:40.44 --> 02:23:47.24
the people that died dying in vain if we don't you you say you said if we don't own up and say

1572
02:23:47.24 --> 02:23:55.40
we did not do this well in the end and you know I always look at that when someone gets wounded

1573
02:23:55.40 --> 02:24:05.40
or killed in combat at a bare minimum at a bare minimum at least we go okay we can learn from

1574
02:24:05.40 --> 02:24:10.44
what happened in the situation we can pass it on we can make sure it doesn't happen again and

1575
02:24:10.44 --> 02:24:19.96
and that's what you're talking about and you kind of close it out by saying I've been fighting

1576
02:24:19.96 --> 02:24:25.16
for 17 years I'm willing to throw it all away to say back to say say my two two my senior leaders

1577
02:24:25.16 --> 02:24:37.16
I demand accountability and that's it pretty simple straightforward message you hit post

1578
02:24:37.80 --> 02:24:45.24
I hit post you hit post how long did it take before you know you start to get in text from

1579
02:24:45.24 --> 02:24:50.68
your friends and your senior leadership I could question no one's asked me this question yet so

1580
02:24:50.68 --> 02:24:58.52
walked in the house didn't say anything got upstairs and I was sitting in my bedroom on the bed

1581
02:24:58.52 --> 02:25:05.80
my wife was getting ready for bed she got a text she said did you post a video I was like yep

1582
02:25:05.80 --> 02:25:11.64
I sure did she's like you know I won't say that girls name she's like so and so my friend

1583
02:25:11.64 --> 02:25:15.40
it's texting me saying you're going about right now I was like oh go and what viral right now

1584
02:25:15.40 --> 02:25:20.68
that's like you should probably watch the video tell me what I've so she watched it and she's like

1585
02:25:20.68 --> 02:25:26.44
you need to take this down we're this is we're gonna get trouble take it down and I was like babe

1586
02:25:26.84 --> 02:25:33.000
it's already up like you can't can't put the lid back on the bottle and even if I could I don't

1587
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.60
know if I'd want to so this is me saying this in this moment I was like I really believe in what I said

1588
02:25:38.60 --> 02:25:44.76
in that video like I feel very strongly about it and so my wife then started feeling the gravity

1589
02:25:44.76 --> 02:25:49.08
of what I had just done started stressing out and so then I went downstairs and was sitting on the

1590
02:25:49.08 --> 02:25:54.20
couch and was just kind of thinking and then all my friends started texting me one of my friends

1591
02:25:54.20 --> 02:25:59.32
from marsawc actually texting me and said still everything you said in that video is correct

1592
02:25:59.32 --> 02:26:03.24
but it's going to come at way to have a personal cost and you're not going to change anything

1593
02:26:03.24 --> 02:26:08.04
is it take it down and I told him I was like no this is the hell I'm willing to die and I'm not

1594
02:26:08.04 --> 02:26:14.68
taking it down and then I had one of my instructors from aitv who texted me is gunny is sexually

1595
02:26:14.68 --> 02:26:19.96
inter awesome dude he's like hey sir I watch your video and I agree with everything in your video

1596
02:26:20.68 --> 02:26:25.88
but our adversaries could take this video and use it against us and I think you need to think

1597
02:26:25.88 --> 02:26:32.20
about that and I think you should take it down and to hand my said you know there's probably

1598
02:26:32.20 --> 02:26:36.60
even some truths to that but if we can't fix internally what we're doing right now

1599
02:26:37.40 --> 02:26:43.96
with this conversation that I'm trying to start then it's all for nothing and so I guess those are all

1600
02:26:43.96 --> 02:26:47.64
three true stories where I was like you know from my loved ones from my friends from people that

1601
02:26:47.64 --> 02:26:51.96
worked for me were all I mean I and there's like ten other examples right so my phone blew up that

1602
02:26:51.96 --> 02:26:57.96
night no one none of them in my chain of command contacted me that night so just people didn't

1603
02:26:57.96 --> 02:27:07.000
knew me and you know I I've never my wife and I never like slept in separate rooms even when

1604
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.52
we were angry like early my marriage I was like I'm never you never making me sleep on the couch

1605
02:27:10.52 --> 02:27:13.88
right like this is our house we sleep together we're gonna deal with stuff but I

1606
02:27:13.88 --> 02:27:17.16
like that night I slept on the couch and I bring that up just to illustrate like that's how

1607
02:27:17.16 --> 02:27:22.12
stressful it was it was just like was she mad just basically because you see where you were

1608
02:27:22.12 --> 02:27:28.12
torpedoing your own career yeah like I said I mean we had stability like in those three years probably

1609
02:27:28.12 --> 02:27:31.80
for the first time in our life and she thought she was gonna be there I had just taken the

1610
02:27:31.80 --> 02:27:35.64
tank manor sees so she knew I was gonna be there for at least in two years and I only had a year

1611
02:27:35.64 --> 02:27:39.72
after that total retirement so she knew she had another three years in North Carolina she had just

1612
02:27:39.72 --> 02:27:43.80
started a new job as a teacher the kids were all in the same school for the first time she found

1613
02:27:43.80 --> 02:27:49.000
they had all the stability that she wanted and then this took her by completes the prize and she knew

1614
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.32
that I probably wouldn't even have this job much longer so every all the stability she thought she had

1615
02:27:53.32 --> 02:28:01.000
you know I took from her some people asked me about this when it was happening and I was

1616
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.08
like on social media or something like that and I got asked about actually I think it was getting

1617
02:28:05.08 --> 02:28:16.68
interviewed on a news channel but you know my response was I guess I drew subconsciously from what

1618
02:28:16.68 --> 02:28:22.68
hackworth says when they say oh do you think you become emotional and he's like yes I had become

1619
02:28:22.68 --> 02:28:33.000
emotional because I've watched so many good men die and I am emotional and that's sort of when I said

1620
02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:40.36
I said listen here's a guy that's been at war for 17 years who I guarantee he's lost marines

1621
02:28:40.36 --> 02:28:45.24
and he's sitting here looking at this situation saying this is I'm not not getting I'm not taking

1622
02:28:45.24 --> 02:28:51.40
this anymore when did you hear from your chain of command the next day?

1623
02:28:53.40 --> 02:28:59.08
So as a batank manager I was always the first one in the office and it just so happened

1624
02:28:59.08 --> 02:29:06.12
that that day my wife had a medical appointment and I had agreed to drop the kids off at like

1625
02:29:07.72 --> 02:29:13.80
at school it's called a-to-clock and so it was like an abnormal occurrence so that's like the

1626
02:29:13.80 --> 02:29:21.48
one day I didn't show up early and so I take the kids and so now I don't get into work until like

1627
02:29:21.48 --> 02:29:26.76
18 and as a batank manager you don't tell people when you're coming in you just show up at a normal

1628
02:29:26.76 --> 02:29:34.04
time but I had texted my option accidentally I came around late and so I tell you that just to say

1629
02:29:34.04 --> 02:29:41.64
my CEO had stopped by my office and called like three times and my upso called me and was like

1630
02:29:41.64 --> 02:29:47.80
hey sir, CEO was really looking for aish probably calm and so when I drove in I got in I think I like

1631
02:29:47.80 --> 02:29:53.88
eight thirty that morning, CEO was actually walking because his buildings let's say a two minute

1632
02:29:53.88 --> 02:29:58.28
walk from my building he was actually walking between the buildings and I saw him and so I stuck my

1633
02:29:58.28 --> 02:30:02.12
out the window and was like do you want to you're going to come back to your place he's like now just

1634
02:30:02.12 --> 02:30:06.44
meeting your office so by the time I went and parked my truck and went in my office I used

1635
02:30:06.44 --> 02:30:15.88
to be sitting in my office waiting for me. What is it? The first conversation between Colonel M.

1636
02:30:15.88 --> 02:30:23.80
M. I came off as actually very caring and they keep in mind this is a career Colonel commands

1637
02:30:23.80 --> 02:30:29.32
like that that doesn't know me very well. I've never met him before my batank man so he's had about

1638
02:30:29.32 --> 02:30:34.36
six weeks of meetings maybe like seven meetings with me so I'm just imagine I mean he's another

1639
02:30:34.36 --> 02:30:37.96
professional I'm professionally doesn't know me it's not like a guy I've been working for for a

1640
02:30:37.96 --> 02:30:42.28
couple years or even a guy that knows a guy that I know real well like I don't know anyone that really

1641
02:30:42.28 --> 02:30:45.32
knows anything that like we just don't know each other we haven't developed much of relationship.

1642
02:30:46.84 --> 02:30:52.68
So he's like so he posted a video answer and he didn't really there wasn't much small talk he's

1643
02:30:52.68 --> 02:30:56.44
like I wish you would have talked to me first if you would have talked to me first we could have

1644
02:30:56.44 --> 02:31:01.32
worked through some of this and that's and he's right and that's a appropriate way and I said yes

1645
02:31:01.32 --> 02:31:08.52
sir I understand and he's like I think that this video might be used to run messages that may not have

1646
02:31:08.52 --> 02:31:14.20
been your intent I wish you would have thought of that and again he was right and then he just

1647
02:31:14.20 --> 02:31:19.32
stated look there's gonna be an investigation that's gonna take place and then based on the

1648
02:31:19.32 --> 02:31:24.44
investigation we're gonna determine what to do I'd like you to go home take the rest of the day

1649
02:31:24.44 --> 02:31:30.12
and I will text you on Monday with where we stand in like all of that was very reasonable right

1650
02:31:30.12 --> 02:31:35.72
very reasonable stuff was this already like on Fox News and I'll hit in the news outlets and all that

1651
02:31:35.72 --> 02:31:44.36
at this point no so this was still sort of you know your Facebook friends you know and then like

1652
02:31:44.36 --> 02:31:51.16
what was it how big was it right I mean I think it probably had received like 10,000 shares

1653
02:31:52.52 --> 02:31:57.56
so I mean by the end of the night it was picked up by all the major news stations so in the morning like

1654
02:31:57.56 --> 02:32:01.64
the comments obviously knew about it I mean everyone knew about it but you know it hadn't been picked up

1655
02:32:01.64 --> 02:32:07.08
by mainstream media yet but it does buy the end of the day but like it wasn't like everybody knew

1656
02:32:07.80 --> 02:32:13.88
hey when your friend your gunny and your wife for all like hey dude take take it down

1657
02:32:16.52 --> 02:32:23.08
yeah what was a question I mean they everyone knew yeah and so my CEO left

1658
02:32:23.08 --> 02:32:31.88
my exo came in and I turned over the the tying to him and then I went home and then

1659
02:32:32.92 --> 02:32:38.04
and then when I got home my CEO called me an hour later and said hey I need you to come back and

1660
02:32:38.04 --> 02:32:43.80
I'm starting to jerk you're out oh that was weird I mean me I'm office he's like no me me in my office

1661
02:32:44.68 --> 02:32:50.52
okay so I mean him in his office and he just looks at me and says and hands me peace

1662
02:32:50.52 --> 02:32:53.72
paper and says you've been relief for cause based on a lock and trust in confidence

1663
02:32:54.76 --> 02:33:02.44
do you have any questions yes what do I do now is it I need you to come in tomorrow he's like

1664
02:33:02.44 --> 02:33:08.92
what'll probably happen is though will be an investigation and I don't think they're going to keep you

1665
02:33:08.92 --> 02:33:17.000
here he's like the probably move you up to quannico and general offered asked to maintain the

1666
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:22.84
investigation so that he can take care of you so he said I was like okay I'm trying to

1667
02:33:22.84 --> 02:33:28.60
like reconcile that in my mind and but at the end of the day like I kind of knew I'd be

1668
02:33:28.60 --> 02:33:34.52
relieved over it and I just said okay sir and so I signed up peace paper that said I'd been

1669
02:33:34.52 --> 02:33:40.28
relieved I walked out and I actually made a post like immediately after it's still up on my

1670
02:33:40.28 --> 02:33:45.16
page is my my face book and like then and just and I was very appreciative I said I think

1671
02:33:45.16 --> 02:33:49.96
effective of 1400 today I've been relieved and then my command is doing exactly what I would have

1672
02:33:49.96 --> 02:33:53.56
done I'd like to thank them for the opportunity of getting to service the AITB,

1673
02:33:53.56 --> 02:33:57.56
Patanky Manor and I look forward to the next chapter right so very appreciative post

1674
02:34:00.04 --> 02:34:03.96
obviously something changed for your regimental commander or somebody talked to him and said all right

1675
02:34:03.96 --> 02:34:08.04
this is what we're doing yeah and but just so everyone just so civilians know what you're talking

1676
02:34:08.04 --> 02:34:13.24
about relieved your command means you just got fired so you got fired and Patanky Manor is a huge

1677
02:34:13.24 --> 02:34:18.68
stepping stone and it's really responsible to you so the ramifications were I would never get

1678
02:34:18.68 --> 02:34:24.04
promoted again and you know as you were through the in your mind I had been relieved I've been

1679
02:34:24.04 --> 02:34:28.68
fired so I knew I would never be promoted again but I knew that there was still potential for legal

1680
02:34:28.68 --> 02:34:35.80
action right so like best case I am just like a disgraced lieutenant colon of the people

1681
02:34:35.80 --> 02:34:40.36
somewhere at the limping towards retirement but you know worst case was I could be separated

1682
02:34:40.36 --> 02:34:48.04
out via legal action and so I didn't know it was just unknown at that time. How many days was

1683
02:34:48.04 --> 02:34:57.96
it until you posted your next video? So that occurred on a Friday and then I went into

1684
02:34:59.32 --> 02:35:06.52
I haven't gotten in all this in the story so this is new stuff I went home and you know my wife

1685
02:35:06.52 --> 02:35:12.60
now had kind of wrapped her head around life was changing and she was still down for the cause at that

1686
02:35:12.60 --> 02:35:17.24
point so she was thinking like maybe we could go down to Florida my parents had vacation rentals

1687
02:35:17.24 --> 02:35:23.80
and my command is the vacation rentals and I had I try to do like I'd father son days with my kids

1688
02:35:23.80 --> 02:35:28.52
and I already had a pre-plan one of my oldest kid down on the outer banks she was like you want to

1689
02:35:28.52 --> 02:35:33.80
cancel the thing with Paul my oldest son and I was like no I think I could probably use like a

1690
02:35:33.80 --> 02:35:39.96
day away with just one of my kids she said we need to talk to the boys and I was like all right

1691
02:35:39.96 --> 02:35:44.36
I was like I don't know if I can do a tonight I've just been fired why don't we you know give me

1692
02:35:44.36 --> 02:35:50.52
the night and so went to bed I was the last night actually slept with my wife that night

1693
02:35:50.52 --> 02:35:55.40
slept with my something the same bed with my wife got up the next morning I got the three boys in

1694
02:35:55.40 --> 02:36:02.60
the couch and I told them hey guys your dad was fired but I was fired for doing something that I

1695
02:36:02.60 --> 02:36:08.76
thought was right I wasn't fired for doing something you know bad or nefarious so I want you guys

1696
02:36:08.76 --> 02:36:14.28
to hear it for me because your your friends at school are probably gonna tell you and nothing

1697
02:36:14.84 --> 02:36:18.52
is gonna change for you you're gonna get to keep living here and I may have to go to Quantico

1698
02:36:18.52 --> 02:36:24.28
to work for the next three years but you'll get to remain in school that's what I believe at the time

1699
02:36:24.28 --> 02:36:33.64
so I told them then I took my oldest son and while we were outspend of the day on the boot all

1700
02:36:33.64 --> 02:36:42.20
I was thinking about was what do I do and I kind of skipped over this to go back when I made that

1701
02:36:42.20 --> 02:36:48.76
post that just thanked my command when I was on my social media I read a public comment from one

1702
02:36:48.76 --> 02:36:53.24
of my previous boss so when I was at SOS a captain the lieutenant Colonel was my battalion commander

1703
02:36:53.24 --> 02:36:59.48
that he did a lot for me he retired as at O6 he had gotten on my social media and said if

1704
02:36:59.48 --> 02:37:04.84
Stuart's other was honorable he would resign he didn't state that he was my previous boss or that

1705
02:37:04.84 --> 02:37:09.48
he was like a mentor to me he didn't email me he didn't text me and I felt like I mean that really

1706
02:37:09.48 --> 02:37:14.36
was like a stab in the back to me because a lot of general officers that are on LinkedIn that

1707
02:37:14.36 --> 02:37:19.40
they gave preferred LinkedIn not Facebook so that's why I had a LinkedIn too a lot of the senior

1708
02:37:19.40 --> 02:37:25.08
officers knew who he was and so for him to call me out like that and so I'm struggling with

1709
02:37:25.08 --> 02:37:30.68
when I'm with my kid on the boat I'm struggling with they relieved me without even an investigation

1710
02:37:30.68 --> 02:37:36.60
like I knew my job as it risk when I posted that video but like I feel like a taller

1711
02:37:36.60 --> 02:37:40.36
organization would have been like hey we're gonna let investigation play out we're gonna let you

1712
02:37:40.36 --> 02:37:44.84
sit and calm down obviously this is personal but you've broken some rules and what's left the

1713
02:37:44.84 --> 02:37:49.96
investigation play out and we'll see where the chips fall like that's the reason but they they obviously

1714
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.64
fired me within like 12 hours were you surprised when you got relieved I was surprised I didn't

1715
02:37:55.64 --> 02:38:00.60
learn investigation take place I really was it did not I didn't expect that like when I was calculating

1716
02:38:00.60 --> 02:38:04.36
what would happen I thought I might be benched while on investigation took place but I didn't think

1717
02:38:04.36 --> 02:38:11.96
I'd be relieved immediately but even that probably wasn't enough to push me it was that next

1718
02:38:11.96 --> 02:38:16.20
comment from my old boss where then I like while I was sitting there with my son at

1719
02:38:16.20 --> 02:38:20.68
planet the seeds of I don't know if this organization cares about me as much as I care about it

1720
02:38:22.12 --> 02:38:26.28
and so I just was struggling with this and so then it came back to like what do I want to do like

1721
02:38:26.28 --> 02:38:31.56
if if none of them care about me do I want to limp towards the retirement for the next three years

1722
02:38:31.56 --> 02:38:38.52
because that's best case and I just came to the decision like no I can't live my life like that like

1723
02:38:38.52 --> 02:38:42.60
this was never supposed to be a career this was always supposed to be something that was fulfilling

1724
02:38:42.60 --> 02:38:46.92
I don't care about the money as much as other people might I really don't like I'll be fine

1725
02:38:47.88 --> 02:38:54.20
and I thought I need to get ahead of this and I'm not gonna let them just dictate the terms

1726
02:38:54.20 --> 02:38:58.04
I'm gonna resign and I'm gonna tell them that because I still believe in what I said and they haven't

1727
02:38:58.04 --> 02:39:04.28
addressed any of that and so after I spent the whole day with my kid on Saturday I kind of came to

1728
02:39:04.28 --> 02:39:10.44
that conclusion Saturday night and so then on we slept in out there on the beach we had a hotel

1729
02:39:11.16 --> 02:39:16.68
and then on Sunday morning I took him back to the house I dropped him off of my wife and I was you know

1730
02:39:16.68 --> 02:39:22.04
I had been fired on Friday so I said hey can't go out to the farm I went out there every once in a while

1731
02:39:22.04 --> 02:39:27.16
just kind of like me time and she was like yeah absolutely I get it and I went out there

1732
02:39:27.16 --> 02:39:32.76
so all my 50 acres I've got two abandoned school buses that I put out there is kind of like trailers

1733
02:39:32.76 --> 02:39:39.48
and we actually I I elisaed to a non-profit called A Hero and we do suicide prevention for like

1734
02:39:39.48 --> 02:39:44.12
outdoor treatment for veterans and so that's why I have it I've had it I've had retreats out there

1735
02:39:44.12 --> 02:39:48.60
for the veterans but when I went out there that Sunday I essentially on one of the school buses

1736
02:39:48.60 --> 02:39:55.96
set up a video and the message of the second video was you fired me I don't think you care about me

1737
02:39:55.96 --> 02:39:59.24
I'm resigning effective immediately I don't want any money I don't want any benefits

1738
02:39:59.24 --> 02:40:06.44
and then I and I posted it and that's where you know really quickly became an escalating series

1739
02:40:06.44 --> 02:40:14.68
of events between the Marine Corps and myself yeah and you know all this even your original

1740
02:40:14.68 --> 02:40:19.32
message you were talking about what you wanted was accountability I mean obviously I wrote a book

1741
02:40:19.32 --> 02:40:25.40
called Extreme Ownership and this is the the very if that's what it is right and that's what you're

1742
02:40:25.40 --> 02:40:31.96
saying even after this video comes out there's still no one responding to anything in the video

1743
02:40:31.96 --> 02:40:40.44
and and they also did some things where they're like they put they put some they made some PR

1744
02:40:40.44 --> 02:40:47.32
maneuvers on you on you saying hey we're gonna make sure that he gets the help they need something

1745
02:40:47.32 --> 02:40:53.72
along those lines so after the second video came out that was so again this was Sunday I was fired

1746
02:40:53.72 --> 02:40:59.000
I'm Friday so I haven't been in the work yet so it's Sunday night well after I made a second video

1747
02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.68
I mean it's 45 minute drive I posted from my farm there's a 45 minute drive back to my house

1748
02:41:05.56 --> 02:41:11.64
about time I got back my wife had already seen it and was very upset and you hadn't pre-briefed your wife

1749
02:41:11.64 --> 02:41:19.48
on any of this no that's why she was justifiably very angry and y'all won't go in all the details of that but

1750
02:41:19.48 --> 02:41:27.32
that's where the that's where the path started the diverge between my wife and I and so I ended up

1751
02:41:27.32 --> 02:41:34.52
going and staying in a motel so I was in a days in for the rest of the week and my yes

1752
02:41:34.52 --> 02:41:40.84
dequestion you asked was they started making statements the Marine Corps PEO office public affairs office

1753
02:41:40.84 --> 02:41:44.68
released a statement that was all over the media because now these videos were getting picked up

1754
02:41:44.68 --> 02:41:50.44
that second video that I did was the banner of Fox News like if you went to FoxNews.com that day like

1755
02:41:50.44 --> 02:41:57.32
that was the first thing was my my face on the school bus right and so the Marine Corps was trying

1756
02:41:57.32 --> 02:42:01.40
to get out in front of it and they released a statement that said we are trying to locate Lieutenant Colonel

1757
02:42:01.40 --> 02:42:07.40
Shellard to protect himself to protect him against himself and his family and I was like what

1758
02:42:07.40 --> 02:42:14.20
and I had my phone on me the entire time and I had even talked to my battalion exo for like 20 minutes

1759
02:42:14.20 --> 02:42:20.12
like I was texting my friends and I was like if the Marine Corps was really trying to find me

1760
02:42:20.12 --> 02:42:26.20
like they didn't think to text me they didn't think to call me and so like potentially potentially

1761
02:42:26.20 --> 02:42:31.80
the public affairs office arm just wasn't talking to like whoever should have been calling me and just

1762
02:42:31.80 --> 02:42:36.60
got out ahead of it first but like the other part of it is maybe like they really just didn't care

1763
02:42:36.60 --> 02:42:40.92
about me and all and they just put that out but like again I'm having all these indicators so

1764
02:42:40.92 --> 02:42:45.24
this like this escalating thing of like me feeling like what I said is right all right you should

1765
02:42:45.24 --> 02:42:48.76
show some sympathy and they're like no I'm gonna poke you in the chest because what you did was broke

1766
02:42:48.76 --> 02:42:52.52
the rules and then I'm like well no come back and listen to what I'm saying like no you're still

1767
02:42:52.52 --> 02:42:56.04
breaking the rules I'm gonna make it worse for you and so like each one of these is just an example

1768
02:42:56.04 --> 02:43:00.92
of like if you think cared about me they would have called

1769
02:43:05.24 --> 02:43:09.16
one thing that I noticed and I heard you talking about it you know at the end of that

1770
02:43:09.16 --> 02:43:18.92
second video you're getting emotional and you're like asking for accountability and then

1771
02:43:18.92 --> 02:43:25.24
kind of ranting against everything a little bit and you say you know follow me and we'll bring the

1772
02:43:25.24 --> 02:43:32.92
whole fucking system down so you're you know going hard and I heard you I heard you later say like

1773
02:43:32.92 --> 02:43:39.72
yeah I didn't choose the best words yeah I'm not appreciate asking that so people have asked me a lot

1774
02:43:40.36 --> 02:43:45.48
do you regret it because my life is dramatically changed lost a lot gained a lot

1775
02:43:46.84 --> 02:43:53.56
the one the thing I've come through this with the understanding is I wouldn't change my original position

1776
02:43:53.56 --> 02:44:00.20
or the events at all I don't apologize but there are certain ways that I delivered the message

1777
02:44:00.20 --> 02:44:05.40
that I would absolutely go back and tweak and the one shining example is the we're gonna bring

1778
02:44:05.40 --> 02:44:09.56
the whole fucking system down in that second video and even in the third video I say a couple

1779
02:44:09.56 --> 02:44:15.88
things that like could it or we're stripped out of context and so yeah you got to understand

1780
02:44:16.52 --> 02:44:22.12
I mean in that second video like that emotion wasn't fake like I knew I was given up everything like

1781
02:44:22.12 --> 02:44:28.44
I I was terrified and I was emotional and I didn't take multiple takes I was like one take

1782
02:44:28.44 --> 02:44:35.16
Jay-Z get on the mic drop it post it right like there was no editing of that video and so

1783
02:44:37.48 --> 02:44:43.08
I wish I could go back because it allowed the media to just paint me as this violent extremist

1784
02:44:43.80 --> 02:44:48.36
and I don't think I ever came any recluse that like obviously in my my can't say obviously in my

1785
02:44:48.36 --> 02:44:52.68
head I was trying to communicate that the system has centralized power it was corrupt and it needs to

1786
02:44:52.68 --> 02:44:59.24
be fundamentally changed but in the emotional outpouring of the moment I said I want to bring

1787
02:44:59.24 --> 02:45:05.16
the whole fucking system down you know I was just mad and I went back and clarified like it might

1788
02:45:05.16 --> 02:45:09.88
like three days later in a post I put in a constitutional manner with one loud voice but like

1789
02:45:09.88 --> 02:45:14.44
no one reads the follow up you know what I mean you get that one shot that's right

1790
02:45:14.44 --> 02:45:19.88
especially when it comes to like a viable type videos that are gonna get out there no one's fault

1791
02:45:19.88 --> 02:45:29.16
no one's following up with that you get home from that video and your life is like you

1792
02:45:29.16 --> 02:45:34.52
didn't pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-re-re-re-re-wife now your life is just like no this isn't gonna happen

1793
02:45:34.52 --> 02:45:41.16
that's right yeah I mean so you know I want I'm probably not gonna develop much more of the

1794
02:45:41.16 --> 02:45:46.28
story with my life and I but I will say you know I still like this past Christmas after all this

1795
02:45:46.28 --> 02:45:50.68
was done you know I got out on Christmas Eve we spent as a family all of Christmas together

1796
02:45:50.68 --> 02:45:55.88
we went to a water park together like I still very much love her we are still going through a divorce

1797
02:45:56.76 --> 02:46:00.76
this situation was very challenging and there's things that we both would have done differently

1798
02:46:01.40 --> 02:46:06.28
and there's reasons the reasons I didn't say anything is because I knew what she would say and again

1799
02:46:06.28 --> 02:46:10.36
this was very important to me but I think more than anything the reason we're going through a

1800
02:46:10.36 --> 02:46:15.72
divorce and we didn't decide to reconcile is because what this situation did was illustrate

1801
02:46:15.72 --> 02:46:22.04
the trajectory of my life and how I'm always going to be on the move and I think in one comment she

1802
02:46:22.04 --> 02:46:27.64
summarized it with I just in retirement one learned how to play golf and you want to fundamentally

1803
02:46:27.64 --> 02:46:31.64
change the government right those are two very different things and the story that I just

1804
02:46:31.64 --> 02:46:35.96
painted you for the last 17 years I mean this woman has stuck by me and suffered through a lot and

1805
02:46:35.96 --> 02:46:41.000
like she deserves a little bit of stability she hasn't had it her her whole adult life and

1806
02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:46.84
she justifiably deserves that and you know she's still the mother of my children so I'll never

1807
02:46:46.84 --> 02:46:50.52
have anything bad to say about it there's talking about the verb it's that I would have changed there's

1808
02:46:50.52 --> 02:46:55.72
absolutely things I would have changed with how I handled my situation with her you know there's

1809
02:46:55.72 --> 02:47:01.000
you know things that I still look back on and it makes me sad but at the end of the day you can't

1810
02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:06.52
look back you just gotta look forward I've tried to do the right thing I obviously hit some

1811
02:47:06.52 --> 02:47:11.80
minds while moving forward but I kept moving forward and you know she still a big part of my life and

1812
02:47:11.80 --> 02:47:20.68
so that is what it is you know I was a rebellious kid and I like was a rebellious kid I listened

1813
02:47:20.68 --> 02:47:26.60
the hardcore music I didn't listen to my parents I didn't like school I didn't do good in school I

1814
02:47:26.60 --> 02:47:31.96
didn't I was like a rebellious kid you can just trace that streak all the way back to my birth

1815
02:47:31.96 --> 02:47:41.000
so when I look at your you're from you what we talked about today from your birth on up it's like

1816
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.60
I don't see that streak and then all of a sudden it's just kind of manifests itself I get you

1817
02:47:46.60 --> 02:47:51.40
look you're talking about when you're in a naughty you're giving away money to these locals and

1818
02:47:51.40 --> 02:47:55.48
you're thinking this doesn't seem like to me I'm thinking that too doing the same thing I'm in

1819
02:47:55.48 --> 02:48:00.68
a naughty a 2006 where former relationship with people I'm thinking okay well I guess this will

1820
02:48:00.68 --> 02:48:06.92
move us in one direction but I'm not sitting there as a obedient you know slave as to what I'm

1821
02:48:06.92 --> 02:48:10.84
being told this what you're being told do do it I always pushed back on my leadership throughout

1822
02:48:10.84 --> 02:48:17.000
my career always had that rebellious streak and this just kind of like do you when you look back

1823
02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.60
at your life do you notice things along the way that are indicators that you had sort of

1824
02:48:23.32 --> 02:48:27.32
a limit to what you take I mean what's movie at movie reference what's the movie reference

1825
02:48:27.32 --> 02:48:32.76
where the guy is like an accountant or something and then he just kind of loses it falling down yeah

1826
02:48:34.28 --> 02:48:38.04
am I right because I never even saw that movie but I remember it yeah Michael does that's what happens

1827
02:48:38.04 --> 02:48:43.64
right he's a normal guy yeah something happens he's not gonna take it anymore yeah nothing really

1828
02:48:43.64 --> 02:48:49.08
happened he just reached his point in general at the beginning like there wasn't like any any indicators

1829
02:48:50.28 --> 02:48:55.64
that was the beginning of the movie known not early yeah everything life traffic so what do you think

1830
02:48:55.64 --> 02:49:00.44
stew are you do you see indicators in the past where you you're thinking like man I always had this

1831
02:49:00.44 --> 02:49:07.32
in that no Michael Douglas basically going to suicide a rampage I don't think it compares

1832
02:49:07.32 --> 02:49:18.84
it's fair again I think yes to your point I didn't always push back I started to give some

1833
02:49:18.84 --> 02:49:24.60
examples there with my regimental commander to kind of paint a picture you know at a certain point

1834
02:49:24.60 --> 02:49:30.44
I started to just solidify who I was what my values were and it's funny a lot of people have asked

1835
02:49:30.44 --> 02:49:33.80
me this which I'm sort of surprised by the question well I haven't actually been surprised

1836
02:49:33.80 --> 02:49:38.84
about a lot of the questions people give me but one of the questions was why now you've been in

1837
02:49:38.84 --> 02:49:44.04
you're in a body in a seven you did all this your whole life why now and they were asking that

1838
02:49:44.04 --> 02:49:49.72
question almost implying as if there's a democrat and that's a president and like I used my platform

1839
02:49:49.72 --> 02:49:59.64
to exploit now to become popular the truth is I think people grow develop an appreciation right

1840
02:49:59.64 --> 02:50:05.48
as a young firstly tenant I wanted to go serve my country you know when I look back on George

1841
02:50:05.48 --> 02:50:10.44
Bush's philosophy to export democracy that was obviously stupid but if you ask 23 year old Stewart

1842
02:50:10.44 --> 02:50:14.76
Chiller or you know I'm watching the Marines in Fluja all I could see or the Marines run through

1843
02:50:14.76 --> 02:50:19.64
Fluja I used to love the movie Black Hawk Down when you watch that movie it's like to

1844
02:50:19.64 --> 02:50:24.84
glorify it if you look at the operational failures it's a mallea that led to that event but like

1845
02:50:24.84 --> 02:50:29.80
I didn't have a deeper appreciation for that so the question you're asking me is like why did I get to

1846
02:50:29.80 --> 02:50:35.80
that moment I had just at that point had enough education and experiences and I was in

1847
02:50:36.36 --> 02:50:41.96
enough of a position of authority that there just wasn't many other people like me at that moment

1848
02:50:41.96 --> 02:50:50.68
and time willing to say what needed to be said so as time goes on after this when do they actually

1849
02:50:50.68 --> 02:50:57.24
like arrest you do you get arrested right yeah so I posted that second video like a week goes by

1850
02:50:57.96 --> 02:51:02.92
now you did you did a September 11 video too right yep did a third video you still

1851
02:51:02.92 --> 02:51:09.32
not arrested yet nope and I even did a fourth video in my Charlie's where I basically

1852
02:51:09.32 --> 02:51:15.000
after my my second a third video was like just kind of an outpouring of emotion when my second video

1853
02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:18.44
was very angry or sign my third video I was really just talking about violence and I was trying to like

1854
02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.92
take the sharp edge off the second video but I still don't really go back to accountability

1855
02:51:22.92 --> 02:51:28.12
but after my third video now all my friends are texting me and being like dude you're looking a little crazy

1856
02:51:28.12 --> 02:51:34.68
you look a little romantic right and so and keep in mind like after my second video even though the

1857
02:51:34.68 --> 02:51:39.48
PAO office put that message out that they were trying to find me then when I went into work they

1858
02:51:39.48 --> 02:51:43.80
command directed a mental health evaluation so my mental health was being attacked from all these

1859
02:51:43.80 --> 02:51:49.48
different angles and it's so hard to defend mental health because if you really are crazy anything

1860
02:51:49.48 --> 02:51:53.000
you say is marginalized because you're crazy right so it's like you're crazy and I'm like no

1861
02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:56.92
I'm not like that's what a crazy person we say you know that's that's catch 22 right that's

1862
02:51:56.92 --> 02:52:01.56
their both catch 22 right first crazy you don't think you're crazy that's right so how do you

1863
02:52:01.56 --> 02:52:06.28
defend it so anyway so did you start wondering you know what you're laughing but like when

1864
02:52:06.28 --> 02:52:11.64
everyone tells you it you do start to question like you know if everyone in this room is crazy like

1865
02:52:11.64 --> 02:52:16.76
what does that make me either I'm the only sane one or maybe I am the crazy one so

1866
02:52:17.72 --> 02:52:22.68
after the third video they actually offered me a deal illegal deal I could have just taken it

1867
02:52:22.68 --> 02:52:26.68
now I've been that but I was like man there's a lot of talk of me being crazy and that didn't

1868
02:52:26.68 --> 02:52:32.52
help myself with these two videos I need to end and bring the message back and so that's when I

1869
02:52:32.52 --> 02:52:38.36
made that fourth video in my Charlie's like general McKenzie is like I can't think in military

1870
02:52:38.36 --> 02:52:45.16
history where someone is so obviously culpable like it's just clear like the Emperor has no

1871
02:52:45.16 --> 02:52:50.44
clothes you have to see it and I could go through all the details as to why I think that but that was

1872
02:52:50.44 --> 02:52:54.60
the fourth video I was trying to bring the message back to accountability and so after the fourth

1873
02:52:54.60 --> 02:52:59.96
video is when they gave me a gag order and just said I mean the gag order was crazy I don't think I've

1874
02:52:59.96 --> 02:53:05.56
actually released the verb of you but it was like if you talk to him and he talks to him and they say

1875
02:53:05.56 --> 02:53:11.24
that you said that you're going to jail like anything like online chat rooms like any email if you

1876
02:53:11.24 --> 02:53:16.52
communicate this was because they offered you a deal but then you made another video that's right

1877
02:53:17.08 --> 02:53:20.44
it's so now they didn't know what to do now I'm now I'm moving faster than their legal deals

1878
02:53:20.44 --> 02:53:24.52
are moving faster than the investigation and they haven't actually charged me with anything so

1879
02:53:24.52 --> 02:53:29.48
they're starting to get scared I don't know if scared's right where but they they don't know how to

1880
02:53:29.48 --> 02:53:34.20
handle they don't know how to address it there's a guy that's not taking the deals and he's still

1881
02:53:34.20 --> 02:53:38.36
making statements and they and everything they've done at this point hasn't been effective in stopping

1882
02:53:38.36 --> 02:53:44.04
it so they hit you with the is this when they arrest you no this is the so after the fourth video

1883
02:53:44.04 --> 02:53:48.68
is when they gave me a gag order so I'm still not in jail you so now you're not allowed to talk to anybody

1884
02:53:48.68 --> 02:53:52.52
that's right you're not allowed to post on social media that's right and now the

1885
02:53:52.52 --> 02:54:03.40
it can be in any form you're just on lockdown yeah a couple points number one I'm

1886
02:54:03.40 --> 02:54:08.76
I constantly say to clients and people and friends we don't make good decisions or an

1887
02:54:08.76 --> 02:54:14.60
or emotional like don't try it this started as a joke when I was a young and listed guy like

1888
02:54:14.60 --> 02:54:19.80
we would go out drinking and make decisions you know and if the joke was hey don't make decisions

1889
02:54:19.80 --> 02:54:25.40
don't make life changes I would volunteer for cartoons and do stuff like that so this is a good

1890
02:54:25.40 --> 02:54:33.48
example right you take a step back and say okay where am I going to be strategically and this is

1891
02:54:33.48 --> 02:54:38.36
another thing I thought about the time is taking a step back and saying okay where does it how does this

1892
02:54:38.36 --> 02:54:43.88
play out strategic from a strategic perspective where am I going to end up just just things to think

1893
02:54:43.88 --> 02:54:48.84
about which you're clearly like hey here's some wording I could have changed here's a thing that

1894
02:54:48.84 --> 02:54:53.48
would have helped out my relationship so there's always things that if you can try and take a

1895
02:54:53.48 --> 02:54:59.08
step back they're going to be beneficial to you almost guaranteed the risk to that is time

1896
02:54:59.08 --> 02:55:05.48
the risk to that is time also the risk to that is you can rationalize to not do anything

1897
02:55:05.48 --> 02:55:11.16
yeah that's right you can rationalize to get to a point where you say you know what it's not worth it

1898
02:55:11.16 --> 02:55:19.40
and and again is it smart to do that calculus it probably is because my my feeling I don't I don't

1899
02:55:19.40 --> 02:55:25.16
know you but my feeling is if you would have run the calculus you would have still came with the

1900
02:55:25.16 --> 02:55:30.76
same conclusion you might have executed your plan a little bit differently but it's important to

1901
02:55:30.76 --> 02:55:35.96
if you can take a step back run the calculus so that way the course that you plot will be

1902
02:55:35.96 --> 02:55:40.68
the most effective course in what you're trying to do and this is just general you know I've got

1903
02:55:40.68 --> 02:55:45.72
some friends and they know who they are who call me from time to time super emotional and I

1904
02:55:45.72 --> 02:55:51.56
got to talk them through like what the strategic perspective is what it looks like over the long term

1905
02:55:51.96 --> 02:56:00.52
and and how to make the next step forward so good good lesson learned and and again from my

1906
02:56:00.52 --> 02:56:05.24
from just talking to you today I think you still would have made the same you would come to the

1907
02:56:05.24 --> 02:56:11.08
same conclusion that this is something that I don't want to use the word passionate not that

1908
02:56:11.08 --> 02:56:18.20
she's just that you were passionate about it but you were you were convicted you had conviction

1909
02:56:18.20 --> 02:56:25.56
about what you were saying and and you know something else from my perspective in an ownership

1910
02:56:25.56 --> 02:56:33.56
and an accountability perspective that I think people don't understand as leaders is if you make

1911
02:56:33.56 --> 02:56:39.72
a mistake and you take ownership of the mistake that you've made then what you can do is you can

1912
02:56:39.72 --> 02:56:46.60
fix the mistake and you can actually change things and just because you say hey this was my fault

1913
02:56:46.60 --> 02:56:55.72
doesn't mean you necessarily get fired or have to resign you know any of these senior leaders

1914
02:56:55.72 --> 02:57:01.80
could say hey this is what we thought we're not perfect I'm not perfect I made a mistake I you know

1915
02:57:01.80 --> 02:57:07.64
I did that I did that with I I made a speech coming from president Biden if I was in president Biden

1916
02:57:07.64 --> 02:57:13.80
shoes what I would have said and it was like hey I made this mistake we under we underestimated that

1917
02:57:13.80 --> 02:57:19.16
means I underestimated that means I thought that the Afghan forces were stronger that means I thought

1918
02:57:19.16 --> 02:57:27.000
that the Taliban was weaker I miss misassessed and miscalculated how this unfolded here's what we're

1919
02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:32.92
doing to fix it and and this is the thing that I think a lot of leaders don't understand when a person

1920
02:57:32.92 --> 02:57:39.64
does that when a leader does that the the team doesn't think oh you see that's right you will

1921
02:57:39.64 --> 02:57:43.80
messed up no they think okay yep he messed up but he's humble enough to take ownership and we're

1922
02:57:43.80 --> 02:57:48.92
gonna get it fixed and we and we'll support him now this is my whole freaking career was taking

1923
02:57:48.92 --> 02:57:55.24
ownership when things went wrong and and so I think just again to some of these senior leaders

1924
02:57:55.24 --> 02:58:04.36
when you take ownership of something it's not it's a step forward it's not a step backward it is a

1925
02:58:04.36 --> 02:58:09.48
true step forward and by the way when you blame other people or you deny or you act like it didn't

1926
02:58:09.48 --> 02:58:13.08
happen that is a step backward that's what people don't understand that's what leaders don't

1927
02:58:13.08 --> 02:58:17.32
understand they understand that saying well it wasn't it was the Afghan people's fault it was the

1928
02:58:17.32 --> 02:58:23.56
Afghan military's fault that's not a step forward it feels like one but it's not it's a step backward

1929
02:58:23.56 --> 02:58:28.92
because every single other person knows people know the truth about what's going on they can sense it

1930
02:58:28.92 --> 02:58:33.72
and I think that's one of the reasons why your videos were widely shared because people thought

1931
02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:39.16
this guy he he knows what he's he believes what he's saying and he

1932
02:58:41.40 --> 02:58:46.76
he's speaking from a perspective of truth like people people saw that people want like oh

1933
02:58:46.76 --> 02:58:50.36
he's trying to blame the leadership what's wrong with that guy no people like yeah he's trying to

1934
02:58:50.36 --> 02:58:55.08
blame leadership because the leadership is wrong and they should admit that they should take ownership of it

1935
02:58:58.84 --> 02:59:04.12
so you get gagged gag order comes then what do you at what point do you get arrested all right so

1936
02:59:06.04 --> 02:59:11.80
I got gagged on what's called a Friday I went through a Saturday Sunday one to two

1937
02:59:11.80 --> 02:59:19.40
Zones did there was to Friday so now it's going into the next weekend and that following week on the

1938
02:59:19.40 --> 02:59:24.92
Tuesday Wednesday I knew that the Secretary of Defense the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

1939
02:59:25.72 --> 02:59:31.000
and General McKenzie were going to be testifying to the House and the Senator and so

1940
02:59:32.20 --> 02:59:37.96
I calculated if I violated the gag order they might have a disproportional response

1941
02:59:37.96 --> 02:59:42.36
and that that would bring attention to the whole message that I was trying to illustrate

1942
02:59:42.36 --> 02:59:50.52
so I made another post that was this one was probably my most insightful you know it had some

1943
02:59:50.52 --> 02:59:56.52
like insightful language in terms of not like revolutionary insightful but I mean I personal attacks on

1944
02:59:56.52 --> 03:00:00.68
people like I attacked all the like the last four presidents you know I attacked general officers

1945
03:00:00.68 --> 03:00:05.16
and I didn't say anything that was untrue but like I said some like hard stuff to hear it wasn't

1946
03:00:05.16 --> 03:00:12.92
very like it wasn't like a uniting message it was just like a fuck you to everyone and again I even put

1947
03:00:12.92 --> 03:00:19.48
in the post I'm ready to go to jail but before I made the post I read the entire UCMJ

1948
03:00:19.48 --> 03:00:23.96
Mania for Courts Marshall and so I knew what the requirements were to send me to jail

1949
03:00:23.96 --> 03:00:28.12
and quite honestly I didn't think that they had the criteria to send me to jail I was kind of

1950
03:00:28.12 --> 03:00:32.04
prepared to go to jail but I didn't think that they had the legal ability to do so

1951
03:00:32.04 --> 03:00:38.04
providing in a gagboard that I thought was illegal and so that was the only time I

1952
03:00:38.04 --> 03:00:44.92
violated the gagboard was that one time and then I showed up at zero eight on Monday and they had

1953
03:00:44.92 --> 03:00:49.80
PMO wait and for me and they sent me to jail and the way they did it was they wrote on the

1954
03:00:49.80 --> 03:00:55.08
document that I was a flight risk which was like just an outward line I showed up at zero eight

1955
03:00:55.08 --> 03:00:59.64
on Monday right I've been with every day on time the full time answering every phone call

1956
03:00:59.64 --> 03:01:03.64
so like it's just a lie and no one will be held accountable for that but that was what it was

1957
03:01:03.64 --> 03:01:09.48
and got to jail that Monday morning and but my calculation was correct all the generals

1958
03:01:09.48 --> 03:01:12.76
had to answer questions to include the secretary defense about why I was in jail because I

1959
03:01:12.76 --> 03:01:17.40
went to jail on that Monday and they started their testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday and then I was

1960
03:01:17.40 --> 03:01:23.16
out you know six days ago I was a total of nine days so you end up getting charged with

1961
03:01:23.16 --> 03:01:32.36
Article 88 contempt toward officials article 89 disrespect towards superior commission officers article 90

1962
03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:39.32
willfully disobeying superior commission officers article 92 dereliction in the performance of duties

1963
03:01:39.32 --> 03:01:47.48
article 92 failure you obey order or regulation article 133 conduct on becoming an officer and a gentleman

1964
03:01:47.48 --> 03:01:58.92
how long did it take for that trial process to come about usually it takes months they did mine five days

1965
03:01:59.80 --> 03:02:05.24
after I got out of jail so you spent six days nine days in jail and what were you doing in jail

1966
03:02:05.24 --> 03:02:13.88
to sit there yeah I was in a solitary cell yeah I honestly all I did was right so the first two days

1967
03:02:13.88 --> 03:02:20.92
I didn't have any any writing gear books and then by like day three my lawyer was able to drop off

1968
03:02:20.92 --> 03:02:26.04
like all these legal pads pens books and he gave me my command investigation that just had

1969
03:02:26.68 --> 03:02:31.48
I mean we can get a death we want but I mean all these statements from these other officers it just like

1970
03:02:31.48 --> 03:02:38.04
weren't just lies just straight up personal attacks and so I was like writing on the legal

1971
03:02:38.04 --> 03:02:42.44
just example of like oh he showed a plate to work that kind of thing oh yeah so

1972
03:02:42.44 --> 03:02:48.68
he was smiling as in his command photo we don't smile in command photos I knew I didn't like him

1973
03:02:48.68 --> 03:02:57.08
when he when I saw that I know another one this one guy they use that in the court of law against you

1974
03:02:58.36 --> 03:03:03.48
these are like I don't like people it's my we either I agree with that guy these are just like you know

1975
03:03:03.48 --> 03:03:08.76
side of the mouth comments these are on statements that they sign right I mean these are normal

1976
03:03:08.76 --> 03:03:14.04
states this one guy I was at the beach with this family a week previous and I went to his

1977
03:03:14.04 --> 03:03:18.04
house for dinner to his previous with our families to hang out and like when I was in that motel

1978
03:03:18.04 --> 03:03:21.80
we're like you know I had no other like can scattered my life's falling apart like I could probably

1979
03:03:21.80 --> 03:03:25.80
really could have used a friend and he was texted me it's like hey still how you doing man just

1980
03:03:25.80 --> 03:03:28.60
want to make sure you're alright it's anything we can talk about like why you doing this

1981
03:03:29.16 --> 03:03:34.36
he then screenshot it those and brought them to the investigating officer unsolicited

1982
03:03:34.36 --> 03:03:37.88
to say look I was trying to figure out what his motives are like he this stew sheller is just a

1983
03:03:37.88 --> 03:03:44.84
fucking a ferries character she'd never been a batile in command you're like who does that like what

1984
03:03:44.84 --> 03:03:50.92
man does that blood in the water there's blood in the water man sharks are going to pounce

1985
03:03:51.80 --> 03:03:58.20
yeah but they didn't realize that I wasn't you know yeah so you end up going up trial and this

1986
03:03:58.20 --> 03:04:03.24
trial the judge you said looked at your record and was like hey well where did this come from the judge

1987
03:04:03.24 --> 03:04:09.40
I don't think one of me to plead guilty so it wasn't you know all those charges you read off

1988
03:04:09.40 --> 03:04:13.40
and there's like all these findings of facts the only choice there's only one choice

1989
03:04:14.36 --> 03:04:18.92
except guilty for all of them at special court martial or plead not guilty to all of them

1990
03:04:18.92 --> 03:04:22.84
the general like so to give in the weeds about what any of them said it was almost irrelevant

1991
03:04:24.04 --> 03:04:28.28
and so so if you did not not not guilty what would happen how to go to general court martial

1992
03:04:28.28 --> 03:04:32.52
and I did remain in jail for another four or five months while they prepared on pretrial while

1993
03:04:32.52 --> 03:04:35.88
they prepared the general court martial procedure and then I would have gone and tried to plead not

1994
03:04:35.88 --> 03:04:44.20
guilty to all of them at general check and then you you pled guilty to all of them again there's no

1995
03:04:44.20 --> 03:04:48.44
like I want to plead guilty to these two and out these three is it is there's no point even

1996
03:04:48.44 --> 03:04:53.24
looking at the details of it it was do you plead guilty to all of this you maybe need to read it

1997
03:04:53.24 --> 03:04:59.64
stew do you plead guilty to all of this at special misdemeanor you get a the lowest character

1998
03:04:59.64 --> 03:05:05.80
characterization of discharges general and ronable which is a little term and later or you go to

1999
03:05:05.80 --> 03:05:10.68
general plead not guilty and if you get found guilty of one of any of these it's a felony

2000
03:05:10.68 --> 03:05:15.64
and you'll get dishonorable and you'll sit in here for another four months and I'll tell you what

2001
03:05:15.64 --> 03:05:20.36
even with that choice I thought very strongly about doing the general because how is it going to say

2002
03:05:20.36 --> 03:05:26.52
bro you're a dysphoria and I know god I know I've got a surprise I know I almost did that and I think

2003
03:05:26.52 --> 03:05:31.16
and to the judges you know sentiment I really think I could have won but you got to I

2004
03:05:31.16 --> 03:05:36.20
would I ask myself was what's the most important thing the most important thing the reason I gave

2005
03:05:36.20 --> 03:05:42.76
all of this up was not to beat them it was to preserve the message of accountability and if I

2006
03:05:42.76 --> 03:05:48.20
felt deep inside that I had broken some of the rules for me to beat them based on undue command

2007
03:05:48.20 --> 03:05:52.76
influence and legal duplts I felt like what a marginalized my message of accountability

2008
03:05:52.76 --> 03:05:57.48
and for me to plead guilty for breaking the rules and then look at them and say look I'm not

2009
03:05:57.48 --> 03:06:02.92
apologizing but I'm accepting accountability I felt it strengthened my message and it also expedited

2010
03:06:02.92 --> 03:06:08.04
my exit so that I could come on you know joccos podcast and talk about how general McKinsey needs to

2011
03:06:08.04 --> 03:06:13.24
be fired right so for all those reasons again I made more sense to plead guilty

2012
03:06:14.76 --> 03:06:19.48
and that so that was kind of it almost anti-climactic a little bit you you I'll tell you though

2013
03:06:19.48 --> 03:06:25.000
there was some drama and so like I said the fastest court martial from exit of jail and agreement

2014
03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:29.56
in the history of the Marine Corps also one of those charges like 88 I think I was the first officer

2015
03:06:29.56 --> 03:06:34.92
charge since Vietnam like they were just like throwing stuff on the wall right but they released

2016
03:06:34.92 --> 03:06:39.48
the command investigation with all those like it's just crazy things that those officer said

2017
03:06:39.48 --> 03:06:44.44
to the media with my medical investigation so that selective articles could be written about

2018
03:06:44.44 --> 03:06:48.60
like how I was a violent extremist and it was just blatantly false stuff like I'm still on

2019
03:06:48.60 --> 03:06:53.80
the fence of whether I should sue for libel or just like move forward but so once they leaked

2020
03:06:53.80 --> 03:06:58.84
at that investigation your point the judge the judge was like if that's true like this is

2021
03:06:58.84 --> 03:07:04.20
criminal like those people should be brought to the court not Lieutenant Colonel Scheller and so

2022
03:07:04.20 --> 03:07:08.04
the Marine Corps was like forced to do another command investigation on the leaked command

2023
03:07:08.04 --> 03:07:12.68
investigation so they did another command investigation and so then I asked for that other command

2024
03:07:12.68 --> 03:07:16.04
investigation because it had to do with me and they're like no you gotta go through freedom of

2025
03:07:16.04 --> 03:07:20.04
information act and I was like let me get the straight so you had an investigation that was about

2026
03:07:20.04 --> 03:07:25.32
me that you leaked through the improper channels you were scolded by the judge you created a new

2027
03:07:25.32 --> 03:07:29.16
investigation still about me about your improper handling and the only way for me to get that

2028
03:07:29.16 --> 03:07:34.52
is to go through the problem the proper freedom of information act like that's correct and I was like

2029
03:07:34.52 --> 03:07:40.84
ah you know this is like have you done that? no I haven't ever come home you gotta relax

2030
03:07:40.84 --> 03:07:45.000
kind of just probably already burned bigger down of me honestly but I probably will so going back I

2031
03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:49.40
probably will sue for libel this one publication and I'll probably freedom of information act

2032
03:07:49.40 --> 03:07:54.52
to add to that libel suit but like right now the most important thing again is the message

2033
03:07:55.24 --> 03:07:58.92
and making sure that people understand I mean there was fundamental breakdowns that are not being

2034
03:07:58.92 --> 03:08:04.36
addressed apolitically that's what I want to change so like do I have grievances that I can legally

2035
03:08:04.36 --> 03:08:09.32
pursue sure but that's like I said earlier like money is really not that important to me so

2036
03:08:09.32 --> 03:08:16.04
we'll figure it out and so you part of your rep part of the deal was you you resigned and you

2037
03:08:16.04 --> 03:08:22.04
were done you're done on the Marine Corps that's right at 17 years maybe 18 years now 17 17 years yeah

2038
03:08:22.76 --> 03:08:28.68
and then you got out what just before Christmas Christmas Eve Christmas Eve that was it

2039
03:08:28.68 --> 03:08:33.80
that was it where were you when you were out what was that night like

2040
03:08:33.80 --> 03:08:41.16
my family came down actually yeah so I looked my family just acted like it wasn't happening

2041
03:08:41.72 --> 03:08:45.000
honestly I don't even think it's hit me because right now you know someone that's listening to

2042
03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:50.76
the show were tape in this and early January but after Christmas with my family then I started

2043
03:08:50.76 --> 03:08:54.60
doing all these media shows that I've been on a gag order for the last four months so I don't think

2044
03:08:54.60 --> 03:09:00.68
the reality was actually hit me yet it's gonna come when I'm done doing on this media and I'm sitting

2045
03:09:00.68 --> 03:09:07.08
in my place by myself with nothing to do that's probably when it's gonna go shit but I've

2046
03:09:07.08 --> 03:09:13.48
stayed too busy for it to be really it so what's so here you are here I mean this is only freaking

2047
03:09:14.52 --> 03:09:22.60
weeks what's next what are you doing so I just want to what's the new mission so I want to illustrate

2048
03:09:22.60 --> 03:09:27.16
like why I'm so upset with general McKenzie and so I'm gonna just take a second talk about that

2049
03:09:27.16 --> 03:09:32.36
and then I'll answer your question through that so the reason I in that fourth video tried to

2050
03:09:32.36 --> 03:09:37.000
prefer charges against general McKenzie which is my legal right to do explain I didn't touch on that

2051
03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:43.08
explain what you did you explain what you did there in the manual for court marshals rule 137

2052
03:09:43.08 --> 03:09:49.16
clearly states that any member of the UCMJ can prefer charges against another member in the UCMJ

2053
03:09:49.72 --> 03:09:55.96
now that when you prefer that means that charge sheet has to be routed up to the first general officer

2054
03:09:55.96 --> 03:10:01.72
with general court martial authority it's sometimes it's at the current level and so the strategy there

2055
03:10:01.72 --> 03:10:07.48
was I knew general Alfred was trying to hold me accountable I knew he would never have the courage

2056
03:10:07.48 --> 03:10:13.96
to refer charges from my preferal but then he would have to publicly declare that he wasn't going

2057
03:10:13.96 --> 03:10:18.12
to seek accountability against the general and he was seeking accountability against me so I was

2058
03:10:18.12 --> 03:10:23.000
using that tactic to illustrate the hypocrisy of the system but they denied me the ability to

2059
03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:26.92
even route it which is my legal right to do I mean it was just I mean illegal in my opinion but

2060
03:10:26.92 --> 03:10:31.64
it doesn't matter so that they don't allow me to do that the reason I was trying to prefer those charges

2061
03:10:31.64 --> 03:10:38.04
is because general McKenzie is the Cent Comcombat and Commander he works directly for the secretary

2062
03:10:38.04 --> 03:10:43.64
defense who works directly for the president what happened was in you know the the story you gave

2063
03:10:43.64 --> 03:10:47.88
in the withdrawal from Afghanistan general McKenzie and I know the operational planners that

2064
03:10:47.88 --> 03:10:51.56
developed the plans for the withdrawal they submitted for the National Security Council

2065
03:10:51.56 --> 03:10:57.48
four or five plans most of them included keeping Bockemaribus but they needed 2500 troops if you

2066
03:10:57.48 --> 03:11:02.20
go and watch general McKenzie's testimony on the backside he says I tried to say that I we need

2067
03:11:02.20 --> 03:11:07.96
a 2500 troops why that's relevant is because they determined that that number was what was capable

2068
03:11:07.96 --> 03:11:12.36
maintaining Bockemaribus when president Biden and the National Security Council said no you

2069
03:11:12.36 --> 03:11:19.40
got to go below 2500 then general McKenzie was at a critical moment right so as a as the senior

2070
03:11:19.40 --> 03:11:25.24
military advisor you have a responsibility to convince your boss why you should execute your plan

2071
03:11:25.24 --> 03:11:28.76
and you can't force your boss to do that but every staff officer knows how to get I mean

2072
03:11:28.76 --> 03:11:33.48
as an operations officer there's an art to making sure that my boss does the plan that I think is

2073
03:11:33.48 --> 03:11:37.72
best because I know better than he does in a lot of ways so it's it's artful but he failed to do that

2074
03:11:37.72 --> 03:11:42.44
so once he failed to do that and he looked at the restraints that were imposed upon his plan

2075
03:11:42.44 --> 03:11:48.52
if he didn't feel like he could execute the plan effectively without undo loss of life

2076
03:11:48.52 --> 03:11:54.84
he had a moral obligation to resign he did not do that once he didn't resign at that point

2077
03:11:55.40 --> 03:12:00.52
he is accountable he doesn't get to go back after the fact and say no I told the president

2078
03:12:00.52 --> 03:12:03.64
National Security Council 2500 and they didn't listen to me he doesn't matter

2079
03:12:03.64 --> 03:12:08.20
that you didn't convince him and you didn't resign it you're the senior military advisor so

2080
03:12:08.20 --> 03:12:13.08
for all those reasons I think general McKenzie should be held accountable right now just as I've

2081
03:12:13.08 --> 03:12:17.80
started this media tour 72 hours ago the White House released the general McKenzie was being

2082
03:12:17.80 --> 03:12:22.44
replaced in the spring by a new sent calm combat commander and I don't think it's a coincidence

2083
03:12:22.44 --> 03:12:26.36
to be completely honest with you because I've been hitting the media pretty hard that guy is

2084
03:12:26.36 --> 03:12:29.64
going to undermine his whole career if he doesn't raise his hand and say he should be accountable

2085
03:12:29.64 --> 03:12:35.16
before he exits so that's one thing I think the operational level of war which is at the combat

2086
03:12:35.16 --> 03:12:40.52
commander level linked to the political policy strategic level of war which is a national security

2087
03:12:40.52 --> 03:12:45.08
council executive branch is where we're failing wars where we failed the Vietnam it's where we

2088
03:12:45.08 --> 03:12:49.40
failed the GWT generation and how you do that as you hold leaders accountable at that level

2089
03:12:49.40 --> 03:12:54.28
and right now Congress and the executive branch aren't holding up there into the bargain I'll give

2090
03:12:54.28 --> 03:13:00.04
an example of what I think is wrong with Congress when I went to I placed myself in jail on a lot

2091
03:13:00.04 --> 03:13:07.88
of ways to illustrate something and I underestimated I overestimated Congress's ability to do anything

2092
03:13:07.88 --> 03:13:14.68
because by partisan took turns with their sound bites of anger about the fail afghanistan withdrawal

2093
03:13:14.68 --> 03:13:22.12
and then guess what nothing Congress's given by the founding fathers leverage over the DOD is the

2094
03:13:22.12 --> 03:13:29.08
budget and what was not in the news is six days previous they unanimously approved a $740 billion

2095
03:13:29.08 --> 03:13:35.72
or 22 fiscal year budget and not one of those vocally outraged congressional representatives said hey

2096
03:13:35.72 --> 03:13:41.56
you're asking for $740 billion who's accountable from the afghanistan withdrawal show me metrics

2097
03:13:41.56 --> 03:13:46.04
of effectiveness for the 21 budget because to do that would require courage to do that would get

2098
03:13:46.04 --> 03:13:52.60
spawn as potentially anti military and that would go against self preservation so what do I want going

2099
03:13:52.60 --> 03:13:57.32
forward I want the operational level of war combat and commanders to start being held accountable

2100
03:13:57.32 --> 03:14:01.80
in the same manner that they were in war war two and look at how many generals Lincoln fired before

2101
03:14:01.80 --> 03:14:08.04
we got to grant and grant wasn't a good tactician but he had operational foresight and he knew how to

2102
03:14:08.04 --> 03:14:13.56
stick with it the second thing I think is we need leaders not politicians so I've got a website

2103
03:14:13.56 --> 03:14:17.80
authenticamericans calm where you can see some of my political views but ultimately it's where you can

2104
03:14:17.80 --> 03:14:24.28
support me and I've also got a second website votes for vets.org because I think we need leaders

2105
03:14:24.28 --> 03:14:29.96
not politicians I've in the four months that I've been on a gag water gone out and organized a bunch of

2106
03:14:29.96 --> 03:14:34.84
people running in the 22 race so I've got five senators and 20 congressional representatives

2107
03:14:34.84 --> 03:14:39.56
that all I think embody the leadership and courage that we need in politics and some of them

2108
03:14:39.56 --> 03:14:44.36
I think have a real good shot at winning some of them are more of a long shot but it's I have the

2109
03:14:44.36 --> 03:14:50.52
ability right now at the platform I built to raise money bring in media to some of these races

2110
03:14:50.52 --> 03:14:54.76
bring in different organizations to support some of these leaders that I think need to be up in

2111
03:14:55.80 --> 03:15:02.68
NTC and is that also linked through authenticamericans.com for the for the people that are running

2112
03:15:02.68 --> 03:15:08.04
for the vets that are running votes for vets okay number four so votes for vets.org is really where you

2113
03:15:08.04 --> 03:15:14.44
can see most of those candidates my website authenticamericans really you can donate to the

2114
03:15:14.44 --> 03:15:19.08
disabled veterans pack through authenticamericans and that money ultimately will go to support

2115
03:15:19.08 --> 03:15:25.88
the coalition that I built but I they're separate authenticamericans is really my brand of my thinking

2116
03:15:25.88 --> 03:15:30.52
and I'm not gonna run most likely in the 22 race I plan to just support these other veterans I've

2117
03:15:30.52 --> 03:15:36.20
been through a lot like I said I think I need to stabilize a little bit and reassess the landscape

2118
03:15:36.20 --> 03:15:42.04
before just continuing to sprint but I do think you know my whole life has been America I love

2119
03:15:42.04 --> 03:15:47.40
America and I love foreign diplomacy and I think the federal politics game is where you really

2120
03:15:47.40 --> 03:15:52.28
make that those changes and so I see myself running for something but probably won't be told 24

2121
03:15:53.16 --> 03:15:55.88
so that's what you're gonna do you're planning to go into politics right now

2122
03:15:55.88 --> 03:16:03.000
in the future in the future I mean right now I'm probably gonna write a book probably you know

2123
03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:07.80
figure out where my house is gonna be at so you know I'm gonna spend a couple of years

2124
03:16:07.80 --> 03:16:18.12
getting my foundation stable until I see something that I think makes sense it's a lot going on man

2125
03:16:18.12 --> 03:16:24.36
it's a lot going on man I can't believe you I'll be got out a month ago that's kind of crazy

2126
03:16:24.36 --> 03:16:36.36
I it seemed like longer time at past you're on social media you're on Facebook on Instagram on Twitter

2127
03:16:36.36 --> 03:16:39.80
yeah if you go to my website all my social media is linked at the bottom so if you just go to

2128
03:16:39.80 --> 03:16:47.72
authenticamericans.com you can find all my pages it's all at Stuart Scheller SCHALER

2129
03:16:47.72 --> 03:16:53.48
yeah it seems like we're at a decent place to close it out to have been over three hours

2130
03:16:54.52 --> 03:17:00.12
echo Charles yes sir any questions I don't actually I was gonna say do you do why don't you

2131
03:17:00.12 --> 03:17:06.12
like write a book or something you are gonna so they go yeah I've been writing all these social media

2132
03:17:06.12 --> 03:17:09.80
posts and this one guy commented me the way they say he was I think he was trying to be nice he's like

2133
03:17:09.80 --> 03:17:14.52
hey still have you ever thought about writing the book instead of slowly writing a book over Facebook

2134
03:17:14.52 --> 03:17:20.68
yeah that's the Facebook seems to be like your primary well the reason social media I mean

2135
03:17:20.68 --> 03:17:25.24
Instagram and like TikTok or really the new generation but Facebook allows long written posts

2136
03:17:25.88 --> 03:17:30.92
and so really now that if you look at it linked in has has a smaller character limit

2137
03:17:30.92 --> 03:17:34.36
and so what I've done now is it's the same post on Facebook and linked in so really

2138
03:17:34.36 --> 03:17:39.48
the linked in character limit is like the exact character limit of all my posts because I usually write

2139
03:17:39.48 --> 03:17:44.44
like two pages and then I try to pair them down for the character limit but it just goes to

2140
03:17:44.44 --> 03:17:50.20
I think the attention span of our current generation they can has to be in digestible chunks

2141
03:17:50.20 --> 03:17:53.72
you know you get one of your books and it's a lot harder to get them digest but if you hit them

2142
03:17:53.72 --> 03:17:57.72
with like five posts separated by three days you got to I think a much higher chance to get in

2143
03:17:57.72 --> 03:18:02.76
them to digest them of that what are you hearing from the marine core right now they've done

2144
03:18:02.76 --> 03:18:07.72
constant right they they have a lot of articles have been written on me since I got out and started

2145
03:18:07.72 --> 03:18:12.92
doing this media and the same statement is we're not gonna comment on a civilian that used to

2146
03:18:12.92 --> 03:18:16.44
serve in the main core and so they've got like one comment that's that we're not gonna comment

2147
03:18:16.44 --> 03:18:20.60
about it and so we'll see though I'm hitting them with a lot of media so that might change but

2148
03:18:20.60 --> 03:18:24.60
like you said it's only been like one week since close to Christmas they've been back so who knows

2149
03:18:25.40 --> 03:18:30.20
what about your friends in the marine core what do they say nothing I mean the the

2150
03:18:30.20 --> 03:18:33.56
the lieutenant kernels that were closest to me in the investigation that I've made I've

2151
03:18:33.56 --> 03:18:37.32
counted a couple interviews and just illustrated what they said they've obviously gone calm silently

2152
03:18:37.32 --> 03:18:41.40
all these other guys that I know have come online and been like that's bullshit that they did that

2153
03:18:41.40 --> 03:18:46.44
and so I think they're probably having a hard time kind of reconciling what they did at least

2154
03:18:46.44 --> 03:18:50.52
I would if I were them I mean I can't speak for them but I can't say I've had a lot of guys

2155
03:18:50.52 --> 03:18:55.96
speak up and so I can't believe they did that like that's so snake in the grassish yeah I mean

2156
03:18:56.92 --> 03:19:01.64
you said you've listened as podcast a little bit I am a huge fan of the marine core

2157
03:19:02.28 --> 03:19:06.44
in fact my my family says that whenever I talk about the marine core I have a quote

2158
03:19:06.44 --> 03:19:11.16
and they'll joke about it I say the marine core is freaking square the way that's what I tell

2159
03:19:11.16 --> 03:19:14.84
you know for whatever reason I'm with my family and the marine core comes up I'll be

2160
03:19:14.84 --> 03:19:19.08
I can bring course free in square the way and it's the truth I love the marine core

2161
03:19:19.08 --> 03:19:24.12
I worked alongside the marine core pretty much my whole career and just if I think the marine

2162
03:19:24.12 --> 03:19:30.04
core is outstanding and this is this is rough this is rough to watch this unfold

2163
03:19:30.04 --> 03:19:34.04
well to be clear I love the marine core I think the marine core is pretty square the way but that

2164
03:19:34.04 --> 03:19:40.52
comes from you know the individual is such a high calmer person holistically in the marine core

2165
03:19:40.52 --> 03:19:45.56
the problem is the centralization of power over time and it kind of puts the blinders on

2166
03:19:45.56 --> 03:19:50.12
so there's some fundamental things that need to be addressed but everything that I'm doing is not from

2167
03:19:50.12 --> 03:19:56.04
contempt or or hate it's from a place of love I have I whole higher guard for the marine's and I

2168
03:19:56.04 --> 03:20:03.56
still think highly of them oh well tell you what you do you take that that 65 page draft

2169
03:20:03.56 --> 03:20:08.68
they had they got rejected and then when you would you cut it on 30 yeah so that other 35 pages

2170
03:20:09.48 --> 03:20:14.12
so you put in your book yeah there you go we all kind of want to hear about that you see yeah

2171
03:20:15.08 --> 03:20:18.44
right on Stu you got any closing thoughts before you shut it down

2172
03:20:19.24 --> 03:20:25.40
now I'll just echo to your audience as I watched my saga unfold in the media

2173
03:20:26.20 --> 03:20:31.80
the mainstream media is so polarized right now it was very hard to get a true assessment of like how

2174
03:20:31.80 --> 03:20:36.44
people even felt watching the news because you know most of the people were taking my statements

2175
03:20:36.44 --> 03:20:42.04
and trying to fit them into whatever their narrative was and shows like yours podcasts like yours

2176
03:20:42.04 --> 03:20:47.16
YouTube channels I was actually getting much more accurate feedback from what people thought

2177
03:20:47.16 --> 03:20:52.92
than mainstream media so I really believe going forward if the mainstream media can't figure

2178
03:20:52.92 --> 03:20:59.08
out how to reconcile kind of their own polarized views that platforms like yours are even more important

2179
03:20:59.08 --> 03:21:03.72
so I just encourage you to continue to get more and further well I will and there's recently

2180
03:21:04.52 --> 03:21:10.60
some information that came out about a Joe Rogan and he's just annihilating the mainstream media

2181
03:21:10.60 --> 03:21:18.92
which is awesome it's just total destruction I mean maybe two three four times what the mainstream

2182
03:21:18.92 --> 03:21:25.40
media has for listeners Rogan has so and and he's one of you know he's the leader he's the the

2183
03:21:25.40 --> 03:21:31.48
head of the pack but there's a lot of other a lot of other people out there that are doing the

2184
03:21:31.48 --> 03:21:37.56
same thing trying to get the word out and trying to talk in a nuanced way about things and you know

2185
03:21:37.56 --> 03:21:42.20
you're a perfect example of a guy that's going to get interviewed and have they're going to

2186
03:21:42.20 --> 03:21:47.16
interview with questions four sound bites that they can make headlines that the people will click

2187
03:21:47.16 --> 03:21:53.56
that's their goal and so you know having you on here to actually give your perspective

2188
03:21:53.56 --> 03:21:59.16
your full perspective say whatever you want like that's the goal so people can actually hear

2189
03:21:59.16 --> 03:22:06.04
and understand where you're coming from and I think that's important yeah well uh thanks for

2190
03:22:06.04 --> 03:22:11.000
coming on man appreciate it thanks for traveling all the way out here I know you uh never made it to

2191
03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:16.52
camp Hamilton or 29 palms for a to be stationed but you finally got to visit city at least for a

2192
03:22:16.52 --> 03:22:22.12
little bit thanks for sharing your story thanks for sharing your concerns thanks for sharing your lessons

2193
03:22:22.12 --> 03:22:31.72
learned um then I know what you did and what you're doing is not the easiest path but you're standing

2194
03:22:31.72 --> 03:22:37.48
by what you believe to be right and what I believe to be right which is people need to take on a

2195
03:22:37.48 --> 03:22:45.64
ship when things happen and that is commendable and I hope uh that despite the negative impacts

2196
03:22:45.64 --> 03:22:52.04
that this has had on you on your life I hope it eventually has a positive impact for the Marine Corps

2197
03:22:52.04 --> 03:22:59.64
for the military at large and of course for America and on top of all that man thanks for your service

2198
03:22:59.64 --> 03:23:04.84
absolutely yeah hey uh you're down the road bring me back on the show see where I'm at

2199
03:23:04.84 --> 03:23:12.68
awesome man thank you all right and with that steward sheller has left the building

2200
03:23:13.56 --> 03:23:16.04
definitely uh appreciate him coming on

2201
03:23:16.04 --> 03:23:26.52
an interesting journey that he's been on um yeah just thinking about some of the stuff that he

2202
03:23:26.52 --> 03:23:33.08
talked about especially from you know at the end start talking about the the political ramifications

2203
03:23:33.08 --> 03:23:39.000
of things that happen and again these are all things that I talk about these things in leadership

2204
03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:46.68
strategy and tactics right you give up your influence um but at the same time like David Hacquard

2205
03:23:46.68 --> 03:23:50.60
just get to that point where you're not gonna take it anymore you know what he what he's talking

2206
03:23:50.60 --> 03:23:59.16
about McKenzie one thing that's interesting is he he and I just thought of this as right

2207
03:23:59.16 --> 03:24:06.36
of right as steward left but you know he mentioned that you're in that position the president says

2208
03:24:06.36 --> 03:24:12.04
no to your plan did it your duty to turn your rank and that is one way of looking at it for sure

2209
03:24:13.96 --> 03:24:17.88
but also you know the other way and I talk about the leadership strategy and tactics

2210
03:24:19.08 --> 03:24:25.24
that's one thing to do or is it your duty to mitigate the risk of the plan that's being

2211
03:24:25.24 --> 03:24:31.24
utilized that's another way to look at it as well and he but here's where

2212
03:24:31.24 --> 03:24:39.32
either of those two options here's the the point that I think is important and this is

2213
03:24:40.28 --> 03:24:47.000
steward agree with this the outcome you own that that's the difference this is something that

2214
03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:52.44
you know when Napoleon said if you if you follow orders even if you know they're wrong

2215
03:24:52.44 --> 03:25:00.68
if you follow orders you're culpable so that's the point so where I might disagree with steward

2216
03:25:00.68 --> 03:25:07.96
that it's the duty of someone to turn in their rank if they can't convince their boss or turning

2217
03:25:07.96 --> 03:25:12.84
their resign from their job if they can't convince their boss that that is one way of looking at

2218
03:25:12.84 --> 03:25:19.08
it at it I would say that it's your duty to execute the plan to the best of your ability and then

2219
03:25:19.08 --> 03:25:25.000
take ownership of the fact that you didn't weren't able to convince your boss take ownership of

2220
03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:30.60
the fact that the plan that executed was one that you agreed to execute and you did and it failed

2221
03:25:30.60 --> 03:25:36.92
and it's your fault so just to again I'm sure you know we'll be able to talk about this

2222
03:25:36.92 --> 03:25:42.20
some more in the future but I wanted to as I was walking back upstairs after I've forgotten

2223
03:25:43.24 --> 03:25:50.76
stew just thinking about that fact of look again one way to say it is your duty to turn your rank

2224
03:25:50.76 --> 03:25:56.68
in my opinion it's your duty to either turn your rank or take ownership of the plan and take ownership

2225
03:25:56.68 --> 03:26:07.32
of the outcome of the plan that's what you do so a little nuance on that but appreciate him coming

2226
03:26:07.32 --> 03:26:16.12
on and again trying to try to be able to allow someone to share their entire perspective so

2227
03:26:16.12 --> 03:26:20.84
he's trying to do the right thing we're all trying to do the right thing we're all trying to do the

2228
03:26:20.84 --> 03:26:26.20
right thing yeah we should be trying to do the right thing I think so too yeah and I think that

2229
03:26:26.20 --> 03:26:33.24
starts with you know improving ourselves yes trying to do the right things in our own world

2230
03:26:33.24 --> 03:26:38.84
it's true yeah seems like something we all should be doing yes I could tell there's any recommendations

2231
03:26:38.84 --> 03:26:46.44
on how we might do that yes I will so well okay so my recommendations are I talk about this

2232
03:26:46.44 --> 03:26:51.64
four things there's actually eight but these four things and they're divided into two each one

2233
03:26:51.64 --> 03:26:55.24
all right this is as far as recommendations to do the improve yourself so you have

2234
03:26:55.24 --> 03:27:02.60
your relationships this is two kinds of relationships my opinion or that can be categorized I think

2235
03:27:02.60 --> 03:27:11.08
uh there's your health and capability two thing um your money and what you do with your time

2236
03:27:11.88 --> 03:27:20.44
and your world view and spirituality the four things okay essentially so you want to improve that

2237
03:27:20.44 --> 03:27:27.96
if you feel like you're lacking in any one of those pay attention to try to improve it good news

2238
03:27:27.96 --> 03:27:35.24
about that about this whole thing good news we have things that will help you improve all these things

2239
03:27:35.24 --> 03:27:38.76
that's it good that's a good thing let's start with the physical actually the physical part of it

2240
03:27:38.76 --> 03:27:44.60
I think is is a big one you know and so well you want to set early on this particular podcast

2241
03:27:44.60 --> 03:27:52.44
sure that the physical one will possibly influence all of them yes and factually factually

2242
03:27:52.44 --> 03:27:58.52
and what I didn't say which is equally as true the physical one will negatively impact all of them

2243
03:27:58.52 --> 03:28:03.32
oh look at that it's slide I'm telling like I actually wrote about both those things and leadership

2244
03:28:03.32 --> 03:28:08.36
oh no in the discipline because freedom failed man oh yeah and you know we all heard the

2245
03:28:08.36 --> 03:28:11.72
hey if you don't have your health you don't have anything like you know like that whole thing I mean

2246
03:28:11.72 --> 03:28:15.88
yeah think about it like if you're like okay let's say you have the best you just landed the best

2247
03:28:15.88 --> 03:28:21.000
job and it pays a lot and you love doing it so you can't really fight as fairs can't walk

2248
03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:30.76
though up the for or you now are gonna are at risk of XYZ terminal diseases yeah no one takes out

2249
03:28:31.16 --> 03:28:35.64
yeah that's not a good situation regardless of how much money you make or what if you have great

2250
03:28:35.64 --> 03:28:42.92
great relationships intimate family friends great but you neglected your health now you're on the

2251
03:28:42.92 --> 03:28:49.24
path to demise does that help your relationships no does it hurt your relationship oh yeah everybody

2252
03:28:49.24 --> 03:28:52.84
sad including you by the way either way you see where I'm going with this all right so let's take

2253
03:28:52.84 --> 03:28:57.88
it care of our physical health let's improve our physical I like it never too late to start my opinion

2254
03:28:57.88 --> 03:29:05.64
well after your dead little bit too late but we're live and we're doing it

2255
03:29:05.64 --> 03:29:13.56
uh good news we have some supplementation to help you on this path physical and mental boom here we go okay

2256
03:29:13.56 --> 03:29:20.04
so a big one that I actually I don't want to say I didn't pay attention to it because I do take it

2257
03:29:20.04 --> 03:29:25.08
every day but it just sorted just you just take it as a vitamin D3 that's immunity that's all it's a

2258
03:29:25.08 --> 03:29:31.48
lot of things that's a big one yeah I feel like when I got Miss Rowna yeah no factor really

2259
03:29:31.48 --> 03:29:37.40
partially because of vitamin D yeah I'm thinking so I'm gonna give you um that I have the exact same story

2260
03:29:37.40 --> 03:29:44.36
so yeah the first time we caught it that was like 20 years again I here's all tight I don't know

2261
03:29:44.36 --> 03:29:51.16
I didn't test positive technically but here look we went end of 2020 right that's when we got it yeah

2262
03:29:52.60 --> 03:29:59.16
no symptoms at all not even like the one actually I don't want to say no I lost my sense of smell

2263
03:29:59.16 --> 03:30:10.12
right that's it no fever no cough no cough no temperature no factor didn't miss a workout nothing

2264
03:30:10.12 --> 03:30:15.72
my workouts as I reviewed I was noticed that my workouts were a little bit weaker than normal

2265
03:30:15.72 --> 03:30:19.56
but I just thought I was over training or something like this yeah you have a bad day yeah no

2266
03:30:19.56 --> 03:30:25.48
sugar and then uh boom right well they say if you have a fever you shouldn't workout

2267
03:30:25.48 --> 03:30:29.24
you can have a cold but if you don't have a fever you can still work out you're about to

2268
03:30:29.24 --> 03:30:36.52
be still like respond correctly that's what I hear I don't know so so this kind of recently we'll say

2269
03:30:36.52 --> 03:30:44.12
an undisclosed time um members of my family took a coronavirus test tested positive so took the test

2270
03:30:44.84 --> 03:30:52.92
no quarantine there's very many good reasons to believe that I whatever they had that my family

2271
03:30:52.92 --> 03:30:58.60
remember had I got it too good reasons will be I'm not going to go into how or why other stuff

2272
03:30:58.60 --> 03:31:06.12
the next day after that the results come back positive right for my family oh yeah test positive

2273
03:31:07.08 --> 03:31:11.000
same deal of course I got it I have two of got it technically I didn't go take a test in test

2274
03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:16.52
positive so I don't know the full disclosure so again no symptoms no symptoms no fever no cough

2275
03:31:16.52 --> 03:31:22.84
no factor no cough no factors in fact so technically I got coronavirus on paper this is what I got

2276
03:31:22.84 --> 03:31:29.24
not in real life not in the field there was no coronavirus to be seen or heard or felt anything

2277
03:31:29.24 --> 03:31:38.12
there's only on paper I attribute that too I think anyway they care that I took of my immunity

2278
03:31:38.12 --> 03:31:43.32
by the midd3 cold war by the way cold war isn't every day it cold war is like you see

2279
03:31:43.32 --> 03:31:48.60
something on the horizon boom cold war all day oh yeah preemptive strike on that

2280
03:31:48.60 --> 03:31:54.28
sir savagery yep so we got all that jockel fuel cold war vitamin d3 we got stuff for your

2281
03:31:54.28 --> 03:32:00.12
joints joint warfare no it's a theme everything is war against this bad stuff all right

2282
03:32:00.12 --> 03:32:05.000
cuz that's kind of what is the emergency there is surprisingly enough our theme is war the

2283
03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:11.80
child war against weakness organs disease or robots war against robots by the way just in case actually

2284
03:32:11.80 --> 03:32:15.96
we like robots from time to time nonetheless okay all right also if you like energy drinks

2285
03:32:15.96 --> 03:32:22.04
or if you would like energy drinks but you don't want to help the ramifications that some

2286
03:32:22.04 --> 03:32:27.64
traditional energy drinks provide for a lack of a better term we got something for you to

2287
03:32:27.64 --> 03:32:35.88
just plain go energy drink all healthy so good no preservatives all natural no sugar all natural

2288
03:32:35.88 --> 03:32:44.60
all natural all natural vitamin vitamin B12 vitamin B6 electrolytes it's so good for you oh yeah

2289
03:32:44.60 --> 03:32:49.16
only 95 milligrams of caffeine enough to get a little bit not enough to give you the

2290
03:32:49.16 --> 03:32:57.24
care so if you're on this path and you're down for energy drink scenario this is

2291
03:32:57.24 --> 03:33:01.88
100% the one it'll keep you on the path not off you drink a bad energy drink you're kind of off

2292
03:33:01.88 --> 03:33:08.68
the path this is not this one boom on the mock don't forget about mock and look you're going to

2293
03:33:08.68 --> 03:33:13.40
get situations where you're like in your life where you have you're on the path you're feeling good

2294
03:33:13.40 --> 03:33:20.36
you're doing disciplined and you just ate a freaking salad with a chicken breast

2295
03:33:21.08 --> 03:33:31.72
super elf hey oh yeah yeah you can have dessert you know 100% good for you yeah so

2296
03:33:32.52 --> 03:33:37.56
so we had a scenario actually I shouldn't even say it because they kind of fell off the path

2297
03:33:37.56 --> 03:33:44.84
but we had a scenario a friend of a friend daughter birthday scenario cake was involved

2298
03:33:45.88 --> 03:33:51.32
big chuck and he was like a cupcake but it was like way bigger yeah but it wasn't as big as like

2299
03:33:52.20 --> 03:33:58.12
a regular sized cake I don't cakes not that tempting to me because I only like the frosting okay

2300
03:33:58.12 --> 03:34:03.000
I don't know those good bro this one was a chocolate what is frosting do you know what it actually is

2301
03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:10.52
what is it well it depends on what kind but uh butter there's a lot of butter in it butter sugar

2302
03:34:10.52 --> 03:34:16.44
flavoring there's like a flavoring of some sort um like chocolate frosting this is butter sugar

2303
03:34:16.44 --> 03:34:21.72
and chocolate and like cream I think that's pretty much it that's part of like there's a lot of

2304
03:34:21.72 --> 03:34:26.52
fake part I don't like that's why cupcakes not really my thing bro I make exact opposite

2305
03:34:26.52 --> 03:34:32.04
and there's six of them and they're huge so you know the kids eat something it's a birthday I get

2306
03:34:32.04 --> 03:34:37.88
them let it slide but bro those big cupcakes there's a lot of leftovers just saying that's a lot of

2307
03:34:37.88 --> 03:34:45.40
you and you know but here's the thing that I only eat one meal that day so technically you know

2308
03:34:46.20 --> 03:34:53.16
but it was it was weakness what is that I do right though so we should add a mulk I should add a mulk

2309
03:34:53.16 --> 03:34:57.56
what if we filled the whole thing here's the thing it was an opportunity it was like what he call it

2310
03:34:57.56 --> 03:35:03.32
one like the bad guys come in at a target of opportunity yeah exactly right up on your mouth

2311
03:35:03.32 --> 03:35:08.60
you got to be by a freaking cupcake oh so I totally did totally did I was doing something in the kitchen

2312
03:35:09.24 --> 03:35:13.32
and there was like a container in the leftovers you know how people when you're younger you're like

2313
03:35:13.32 --> 03:35:19.56
gonna go out with your friends drinking and you do like all we're gonna pre-game ever heard of that

2314
03:35:19.56 --> 03:35:24.28
yes sir hey we're gonna pre-game there's a little hint but a little hint for everybody let's say you're

2315
03:35:24.28 --> 03:35:30.68
going to watch the UFC at your friend's house or you're going to you know your wife's got a friend

2316
03:35:30.68 --> 03:35:36.84
that has some part you know whatever you're going to some unknown realm will you're not sure what's

2317
03:35:36.84 --> 03:35:44.12
gonna be eating pre-game with a mulk pre-game with a mulk that way they show up look they show up with

2318
03:35:44.12 --> 03:35:51.40
you know pizza and instead of eating nine pieces of pizza you just had a mulk you're so correct

2319
03:35:51.40 --> 03:35:57.64
you're so good maybe have apiece you know we're gonna be social either pizza pizza tastes good whatever oh yeah

2320
03:35:58.36 --> 03:36:03.96
so I'd get before back in the day long time ago I'd get I'd order sushi and you know it's sure

2321
03:36:03.96 --> 03:36:09.64
some people in the room don't really aren't really into sushi and I am very much so and I get it when

2322
03:36:09.64 --> 03:36:15.40
I'm like super hungry um next to the sushi spot is a place you can get milkshakes so everyone's

2323
03:36:15.40 --> 03:36:21.000
why I'd get a milkshake too if you drink some of the milkshake before the sushi it's like you're not even

2324
03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:27.08
that hungry for the sushi anymore counterproductive yeah because it's not only is there calories for

2325
03:36:27.08 --> 03:36:31.64
sure but it's like sweet you know what it is actually a great game you accidentally pre-game

2326
03:36:31.64 --> 03:36:38.36
pre-game with the wrong thing that's a well what if it's absolutely true you pre-game with the

2327
03:36:38.36 --> 03:36:42.68
mulk or if you're gonna go out to dinner where it's like hey we're going to this place it's not

2328
03:36:42.68 --> 03:36:48.28
necessarily that hotel you can food yes you're gonna get the chicken parm which is kind of

2329
03:36:48.28 --> 03:36:53.48
you know we're borderline we're brushing up again spares still gonna have some pasta with it which

2330
03:36:53.48 --> 03:36:59.88
so no pre-game yeah pre-game that's what I'm saying both hint for the world but that's a good

2331
03:36:59.88 --> 03:37:04.20
actually really good advice man I do that all the time the other thing you gotta watch out for

2332
03:37:04.20 --> 03:37:09.96
you you go this is another situation hey we're gonna do dinner party you ever go to it like one of

2333
03:37:09.96 --> 03:37:16.84
those the people are on here on top of things right so you show up at five you tell me we're

2334
03:37:16.84 --> 03:37:21.56
going to a dinner party that means we're gonna be eating dinner we show up at five next thing I

2335
03:37:21.56 --> 03:37:26.60
know it's seven o'clock that we have a neat stuff now I'm not happy about the scenario right

2336
03:37:26.60 --> 03:37:31.24
so yeah because guess what it's not that you're not eating because they're putting out freaking

2337
03:37:31.24 --> 03:37:38.76
chips and whatever yeah it's a pre-game yeah pre-game that's what I'm saying pre-game with the mulk

2338
03:37:38.76 --> 03:37:44.04
and I don't want to get too technical though now that I just realized it does it's actually kind of the

2339
03:37:44.04 --> 03:37:49.32
opposite it is a pre-game technically but does the opposite of a drinking pre-game I've always heard

2340
03:37:49.32 --> 03:37:55.56
a pre-game as the drinking yeah oh yeah that's not the only way out in the drinking pre-game you drink

2341
03:37:55.56 --> 03:38:01.24
to get more liquor don't liquor it up you don't drink the milk to get more

2342
03:38:02.92 --> 03:38:06.68
full yes I guess kind of it's a positive pre-game that's what we're talking

2343
03:38:06.68 --> 03:38:10.92
for pre-game nonetheless very constructive pre-game beneficial if you want to do this stuff go to

ground of podcast where you're kid podcast we can also join us at the underground joc on the ground dot com

2369
03:40:38.28 --> 03:40:43.40
there's weird things happening out there there's people being banned shadow banned

2370
03:40:44.60 --> 03:40:51.000
there's videos being censored which is crazy yeah like we talk about china

2371
03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:56.44
and the fact that they banned parts of the internet and social media they you are not allowed

2372
03:40:57.08 --> 03:41:03.24
and here it is happening here in america all the enough what is the what do you think is like the

2373
03:41:04.04 --> 03:41:10.12
above board not even above board what what is the motive you think and banning someone

2374
03:41:11.24 --> 03:41:16.84
driving a narrative i feel i'm sorry man i feel like someone who's it response i mean i'm

2375
03:41:16.84 --> 03:41:20.36
sure this is a group people who are responsible for that and they're kind of running the

2376
03:41:20.36 --> 03:41:25.08
banning but what is it like what is the conclusion that they come to the be like you know what we

2377
03:41:25.08 --> 03:41:29.08
should really just ban this is just driving a narrative they're driving a narrative and here

2378
03:41:29.08 --> 03:41:33.80
there's there's what sucks is the worst thing you can do to try and drive a narrative is not

2379
03:41:33.80 --> 03:41:38.44
let people talk because if someone has a dumb idea the best thing you could do is let them talk

2380
03:41:38.44 --> 03:41:43.40
about their dumb idea so we can say hey here's your why your idea is dumb what's scariest when

2381
03:41:43.40 --> 03:41:46.92
we let ego get involved and instead of me saying you know what echo's got a opinion

2382
03:41:46.92 --> 03:41:52.60
i'm not sure if he's right or not but i think he's wrong so therefore i'm gonna ban him

2383
03:41:53.64 --> 03:41:57.16
i should be like well echo's got an idea if that idea actually has merit we should bring it

2384
03:41:57.16 --> 03:42:01.56
out in the open we should talk about it and see if it's right or wrong or maybe not necessarily

2385
03:42:01.56 --> 03:42:06.60
right or wrong this is where it's this is what's scary not necessarily right or wrong everyone

2386
03:42:06.60 --> 03:42:13.08
wants everything to be black or white science science isn't black and white science changes

2387
03:42:13.08 --> 03:42:22.12
so when you say something is wrong what how many things are actually wrong not too many

2388
03:42:22.12 --> 03:42:28.36
especially when you have evolving situations whether they're political situations medical situations

2389
03:42:29.24 --> 03:42:35.08
these things evolve and so to just say you know what we're not gonna let you talk about your

2390
03:42:35.08 --> 03:42:42.44
idea is really crazy and it's happening that's why we made the jocca on the ground jocca on

2411
03:44:51.16 --> 03:44:57.88
to make one for cupcakes well because you got to have much by a cupcake but it was that was like

2412
03:44:58.68 --> 03:45:03.56
it was like too fast for me to be like oh let me pop in trick and psychological warfare

2413
03:45:03.56 --> 03:45:08.60
I don't even think I have my phone you got ambush I got hey hey look you see it's not used to be

2414
03:45:08.60 --> 03:45:13.24
a hundred percent as effective as now no longer well I didn't put it in if I put it in and I still

2415
03:45:13.24 --> 03:45:19.80
chose to eat the the oversized cupcake which had a very large front end benefit by the

2416
03:45:21.48 --> 03:45:26.52
banning would not have been a hundred percent but you know I chose not to you know to put it in

2417
03:45:27.16 --> 03:45:31.08
but nonetheless you put it in a hundred percent effectiveness it'll get you past these moments

2418
03:45:31.08 --> 03:45:35.000
these common moments of weakness skipping the workout nope you won't skip the workout

2419
03:45:36.36 --> 03:45:40.76
about today I didn't I wasn't about to skip the workout at all but you know every time when you

2420
03:45:40.76 --> 03:45:46.28
you talk about like oh yeah when you wake up and it's cold but it's warm in the bed

2421
03:45:46.28 --> 03:45:50.44
yeah today was literally like that this morning's chilly out there didn't need it though

2423
03:45:55.88 --> 03:46:02.76
cold tub oh yeah I didn't but the the cold shower you know how they say one of the benefits is like

2424
03:46:02.76 --> 03:46:07.16
it exercises your mind to do something you really don't want to do so that way like mentally

2425
03:46:07.16 --> 03:46:15.72
everything else seems like I don't know easier or whatever um I guess even though you really don't

2426
03:46:16.36 --> 03:46:21.000
that's not the first thing you want to do going a cold shower or cold tub when you wake up usually

2461
03:50:11.88 --> 03:50:17.16
your service in the marine court to our country and thanks to all the military personnel

2462
03:50:17.80 --> 03:50:23.000
out there right now trying to make a difference in the world trying to keep it safe for freedom

2463
03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:29.88
by doing what few people will do and the same goes for our police and law enforcement fire fighters

2464
03:50:29.88 --> 03:50:36.60
paramedics and these dispatchers correctional officers board patrol secret service all first responders

2465
03:50:37.48 --> 03:50:41.72
thank you for keeping us safe and protecting freedom here at home

2466
03:50:44.04 --> 03:50:48.12
and everyone else out there there are a lot of forces at work in the world

2467
03:50:49.40 --> 03:50:55.32
a lot of strings being pulled a lot of decisions being made there are agendas and personalities

2468
03:50:55.32 --> 03:51:02.52
and people sometimes look out for their own self interests and that's okay sometimes in most

2469
03:51:02.52 --> 03:51:08.84
cases that's good because when we're all looking out for own self interest then collectively

2470
03:51:08.84 --> 03:51:16.20
we're moving forward but sometimes people's self interest starts to hurt others especially

2471
03:51:16.20 --> 03:51:23.16
from a strategic perspective when people start to look at their own self interest and it helps

2472
03:51:23.16 --> 03:51:32.44
them but it hurts us as a whole from a strategic perspective that's when you may have to step up

2473
03:51:32.44 --> 03:51:37.40
and try and do it tactfully and try and do it through influence and by building relationships

2474
03:51:37.40 --> 03:51:46.92
and by guiding others in the right direction and if none of that works then thanks strategically

2475
03:51:46.92 --> 03:51:55.48
about how to handle your next steps do the calculus don't let your emotions drive your decisions

2476
03:51:56.12 --> 03:52:01.96
think about that indirect approach from be a slid-out heart think about the effectiveness or

2477
03:52:01.96 --> 03:52:10.92
the ineffectiveness of being direct and then make sure you are staying true to your principles

2478
03:52:10.92 --> 03:52:18.36
and what you believe in after all in the end you have to look yourself in the mirror

2479
03:52:19.32 --> 03:52:25.64
and you have to be able to look yourself in the mirror and know that you did the right things

2480
03:52:25.64 --> 03:52:33.56
for the right reasons so move with caution but also with conviction

2481
03:52:33.56 --> 03:52:40.84
until next time Zeko and Jockel out
