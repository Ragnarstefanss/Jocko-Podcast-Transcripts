00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jocco podcast number 76 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Freedom.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's something that you hear me talk about all the time.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I say little things like don't take it for granted.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And I say be thankful for your freedom.

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I even say things like you don't appreciate your freedom until it's gone.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Pretty common statements you hear from people.

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But how many of us have actually had our freedom taken away?

9
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And not metaphorically speaking and not some self-imposed and thereby self-controlled way.

10
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And not in some way trapped by a situation in our life that we don't have the courage to get out of.

11
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But I am talking about an actual loss of freedom.

12
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Caged, controlled, starved, beaten, tortured.

13
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And I say how long can you take that for?

14
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But our day, what about a week or a month?

15
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What about a year for six years?

16
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What do you do?

17
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
How do you survive?

18
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:35.000
How do you get up every day and face the awful reality that you live in?

19
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Fear, oppression.

20
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And how do you take that darkness and that fear and that oppression and turn it into something good?

21
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Well, it is my honor today to have with us a man that can answer those questions.

22
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Retired, Navy Captain, Charles Charlie Plum, Naval Academy graduate, F4 Phantom Fighter Pilot,

23
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and prisoner of war, men North Vietnam, for six years, six years.

24
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Sir, it is an absolute honor to have you on and thank you so much for being here.

25
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Thank you, Jack. It is a pleasure to be with you.

26
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And let's just start from the beginning of Captain Charlie Plum.

27
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You were, I know you are born wearing.

28
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
As I was born in Gary, Indiana, during World War II, my father was about to be inducted.

29
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And so he moved us to a little tiny town in Kansas where he thought my mother and I and my big sister could live there while he went off the war.

30
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Well, as it turned out, he couldn't pass the physical, so he didn't go to war.

31
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But that's where I grew up in a tiny town in the middle of Kansas.

32
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And I know you did, you went to work pretty early age, throwing papers.

33
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And you referred to that in the book and that, I just, that's just an nostalgic thing, isn't it?

34
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
No one throws papers anymore. It doesn't happen.

35
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
There's no kids with paper roads anymore.

36
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I guess that's true. I read a statistic one time of all the successful people in the world, most of them were paper boys.

37
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But not anymore. You know, see that.

38
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Yeah, now they're throwing up Twitter posts.

39
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
That's it. Now, I, I, through the, that's a, to pick a daily capital in this little town of 300 people.

40
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I had about 55 customers.

41
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The, the route was five miles long.

42
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And on a cold February morning in Kansas, that was a, a long way.

43
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I finally convinced my father that I could, that I could buy a motor scooter with all of my earnings.

44
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And so we went across the river where there was no bank in town when across the river to Perry, Kansas.

45
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And borrowed enough money to buy a Kushman motor scooter.

46
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And I was only 14 when that happens.

47
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Yeah, so I got arrested one night.

48
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Trying to make a good up to no good.

49
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
What were you doing that you got arrested on the motor scooter?

50
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Well, I was trying to go to the county fair.

51
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Because can you even speed on a motor scooter?

52
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

53
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But I, I was small for my age.

54
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So at, at 14, I, I know I wasn't five feet and, and, and, and, and, and, my buddy on the back, and he was even smaller than I.

55
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And I think that the cops just didn't saw these dude look kids on a motor scooter.

56
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And the middle of the night.

57
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And we were arrested.

58
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And, uh, at some point, I think it was, you had a basketball coach.

59
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
There were coach of your school that was a pilot in World War II.

60
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
He was, he was actually, he, he was a vet.

61
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
If it not a pilot, he was a, a doughboy in World War I.

62
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Wow.

63
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yeah.

64
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And he had trapped Nolan and his leg from his war and he walked with a limp.

65
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Um, and, but, and he was quite a disciplinary in.

66
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Yeah.

67
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And he, he tried to make that little basketball team work, but we, we were just really not, not very talented.

68
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
What is it about?

69
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I don't know.

70
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
When I was a kid, and I would see, you know, a Vietnam vet.

71
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
For me, that's primarily what I would see as an old Vietnam vet.

72
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And I'd say, hey, that guy's got shrapnel, his leg, and walks with a limp.

73
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
When I grow up, I want shrapnel in my leg.

74
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I want to walk with a limp.

75
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
That's my goal.

76
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Is that just, is that just part of, you know, boy nature?

77
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It, it may very well be.

78
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Yeah.

79
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So, so, what did he tell you about about pilot's, did he explain that to you?

80
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
How to get the idea from, you know, being a doughboy to being a pilot?

81
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Well, quite a long transition.

82
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
See, this was early on in my career.

83
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I had a coach later in high school that had been a pilot in World War II.

84
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Okay.

85
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So, Bill Johnson had been a pilot.

86
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
In fact, he flew F-8s off aircraft carriers.

87
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I was fascinated by that whole idea.

88
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But I will tell you that being a hay seed from Kansas,

89
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I never even dreamed of flying an airplane.

90
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I've never been in one.

91
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I've seen them fly over.

92
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But the whole idea I've ever even riding in an airplane,

93
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
let alone piloting one, was beyond my grasp.

94
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It really was.

95
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So, how did you end up then transitioning from high school and you end up going to the Naval Academy?

96
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Well, that was kind of my accident, too.

97
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I needed an education.

98
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
My parents were too poor at sending me to college.

99
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I started looking for scholarships.

100
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And my older sister was dating a guy who was an NROTC student at University of Kansas.

101
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And he gave me a book that says, here's how you apply for the NROTC in Kansas.

102
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Well, the back page of the book in fairly small letters said,

103
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Oh, by the way, it's the same qualifications to go to the Naval Academy.

104
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Well, what the heck did you even know what the Naval Academy was?

105
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I figured out right there.

106
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I didn't know about the Army Navy game.

107
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I didn't know anything.

108
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Now, my closest relative in the military was a cousin in the Coast Guard.

109
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And so, I was just ignorant about the military and total.

110
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, you know, I'd like to see their job on tell you that all these great dreams, you know,

111
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
of being a fighter pilot in the admiral and commanding ships and squadrons of the military.

112
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
No, it was all by accident.

113
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In fact, when I applied, you know, you get appointments from Congressmen.

114
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The Congressman of my district in Kansas did it by a competitive method.

115
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And everybody was interested to took a government test, you know,

116
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to for a G rating, you know, a government service rating, a G S test.

117
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And there were about 35 guys that took the test.

118
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And so, he nominated five of us who got better scores than the test than the rest.

119
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And then he appointed one guy to the Naval Academy in an alternate.

120
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And I was the second alternate.

121
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Okay.

122
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Well, the first guy also had an appointment to the Air Force Academy.

123
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So, he took that.

124
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The second guy discovered girls.

125
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
That's all you have to write.

126
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I'm going to be the Naval Academy.

127
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So I was actually the second alternate to go to the...

129
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And so I got to that gray-hunt bus in Kansas City, Kansas, and the two days later,

130
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
took me two days to get to Washington, at E.C.

131
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And of course, I was seen country I'd never seen before.

132
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And that's when I raised my hand as you did and pledged to defend the constitution.

133
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And I did states against all enemies foreign and domestic.

134
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And then, at some point at the...

135
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Did you... did you know about Naval Aviation?

136
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I guess you did from Bob Johnson.

137
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Yeah.

138
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
He told you about Naval Aviation.

139
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Did you have that fought in your mind of Naval Aviation at that point?

140
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Not really.

141
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I still... I still kind of assumed that I could never qualify to do that.

142
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
You know, and thinking back at it, you know, I think well, where were my dreams?

143
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But kids that grow up in little towns don't usually have big dreams.

144
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
We don't know how to do that.

145
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And my parents, my father had completed the eighth grade.

146
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
That was his education.

147
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
My mother had, in fact, completed high school.

148
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But I was one of the first in a family that ever go to college.

149
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And so, you know, it was...

150
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It wasn't even a part of the thought process.

151
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So, once I got to the Naval Academy and, you know, thought back to Bob Johnson and that kind of experience.

152
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And saw that there was a possibility of doing this.

153
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Then my energy is an effort stirred turned towards Naval Aviation.

154
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And it must have been... I mean, that's always been ultra competitive at the Academy.

155
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And I know we had another pilot on Dave Burke and he was talking about how each step of the way he kind of looked around and said,

156
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I think I can actually do this.

157
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
You know, it's kind of the same thing.

158
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You look around and say, I think I can get the best grades.

159
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I think I can get this position.

160
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
At some point, you must have said,

161
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I think I can do this.

162
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
There was, as a matter of fact, and there's a great revelation.

163
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And when you're completely finally talked to yourself

164
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
into accepting the fact that you do have the talent to do this.

165
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And until that point, you don't really try as hard, I guess.

166
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And while you're at the Academy also, is this when you've gotten involved with Anne for the first time?

167
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Is that at the Naval Academy?

168
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And was my high school sweetheart?

169
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yeah, we played the French horn in the band together.

170
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The girls with the French horn.

171
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
She was a beauty.

174
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And was a beauty.

175
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And she showed up at our school.

176
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
She came into our town in Kansas from Indiana.

177
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And she had a boyfriend in Indiana.

178
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
She wasn't telling me about, you know, for the first time.

179
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Charlie don't care about that boyfriend.

180
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
No, and his name was Bart.

181
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And then I called him black Bart.

182
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So Bart was, and she wouldn't kiss me.

183
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
You know, I mean, we dated for months, and it's the girl wouldn't kiss me.

184
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Yeah, dang, you know, it's tough.

185
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I mean, it's the most reaction I've ever seen out of echo.

186
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I don't remember podcast.

187
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I think he's been there.

188
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
He's just heard of it.

189
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
He gets a bad memories on that one.

190
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Finally, it's a black off-lost.

191
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
That's hard.

192
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's hard.

193
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Maybe we should talk about your story.

194
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Oh, it's a one of the times.

195
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Oh, God's a kissing denial.

196
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It's going on over there.

197
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
That goes to our own.

198
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So finally, I think it was Thanksgiving.

199
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It was right at Thanksgiving, and I intercepted a letter that she got in from Bart.

201
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And how do you intercept the letter?

202
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I get an outbreak in the trip.

203
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
No, it was a lot of bombardment.

204
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So we'll leave it at that again.

205
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So just we're going to leave that one.

206
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Okay, I can find it her.

207
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
You know, it's Guy Bart.

208
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Oh, no, it's a no, we're serious.

209
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And we're going to get married someday.

210
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
In fact, he's coming to Kansas for Christmas.

211
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I said, I'm making a deal with you.

212
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I said, I don't think he's coming for Christmas.

213
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And so if he comes, I'll back off.

214
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And you don't have to worry about me trying to kiss you anymore.

215
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But if he doesn't come, then you and I go steady.

216
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Well, he didn't come.

217
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Yeah.

218
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And so that started a wonderful relationship.

219
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We then went steady in high school.

220
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Of course, then I go off to the Naval Academy.

221
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Fur piece from Kansas.

222
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And she went to the University of Kansas for her first year there.

223
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And but we continued to communicate.

224
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And I was, well, I saw her Christmas time when I came home.

225
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And then she decided to move to Washington, DC, to work for a senator out there.

226
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And so she spent the next three years, the last three years at the Naval Academy.

227
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
They're close enough so that we could continue to see each other.

228
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So it was, I knew it was one of those, you know, one and only kind of a thing.

229
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Because I didn't really date a whole lot in the high school.

230
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And she was yet, for sure.

231
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So then you guys got married. Did you wait to graduate from the Naval Academy?

232
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Yes, yes.

233
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You can't get married.

234
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Well, you're at the Naval Academy.

235
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
At least you're not supposed to.

236
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
A couple of guys did.

237
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And I didn't.

238
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And so the day after I graduated from the Naval Academy, we were married.

239
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And my six buddies held up their swords.

240
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Well, one was a Marine.

241
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And so he held up his sabers.

242
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We came down from the chapel through the arch of swords.

243
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And it was a beautiful day and a beautiful wedding.

244
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And from there we went immediately to flight training.

245
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Did you, sir, when did you find out you were getting picked up for flight training?

246
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Our senior, so the last, last part of our senior year, you could apply.

247
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And then you go through all of the hoops that you go through to try to qualify for an Naval Aviation.

248
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So I found out probably a month or six weeks before I graduated.

249
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I graduated that was going to be my, my tour.

250
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Do you graduate in 64?

251
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Yes.

252
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So when you graduated, did you guys, were you guys thinking Vietnam already?

253
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
No, it wasn't just too early.

254
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And it was limited operation.

255
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So it wasn't really something that you guys were thinking about front of mind.

256
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I don't remember ever hearing the word Vietnam,

257
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
while I was just in the Naval Academy.

258
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Wow.

259
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Yeah.

260
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
So you rolled to flight school.

261
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Just thinking, hey, we're going to fly around.

262
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
We're going to go to regular deployments.

263
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
We're too to hurt about, but you weren't thinking about Vietnam.

264
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Yep.

265
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So at what point was that in flight school when you first started thinking yourself?

266
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Yes.

267
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Here we got guys over here drop bombs.

268
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Yeah.

269
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Well, Evapera, Ev Alvarez was shot down the first, the first,

270
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
a period of it to be shot down on August 1964.

271
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Okay.

272
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So it became a reality that while I was in flight training,

273
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
another Naval Aviator was in prison in Vietnam.

274
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Now, I didn't understand the politics.

275
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I didn't question the politics of it at all.

276
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I just did the best I could in flight training and enjoyed it.

277
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You know, I mean, it's a kick.

278
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Did you guys, did your attitudes shift it also for my generation?

279
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
When all of a sudden September 11 happened,

280
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
it was like a paradigm shift and everyone's mentality.

281
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
That day, it was such a clear, clear,

282
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
demonstration and we all knew that we were going to war.

283
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And that was an immediate attitude shift.

284
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Did you guys start to have a shift in attitude?

285
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Or was it so?

286
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Because the way Vietnam escalated more slowly,

287
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
was it more of a slow escalation in your minds as well?

288
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
No, it was very slow.

289
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
You know, the ill story of the frog in the pot of boiling water.

290
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
You know, he jumps out in the air.

291
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
But no, it was just warmed up very slowly for us.

292
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And I didn't even, as I went through fight training,

293
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
you know, I mean, I learned to drop bombs and shoot guns and all that stuff.

294
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And it was challenging and it was exciting.

295
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
But I didn't see the reality of it.

296
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I didn't really picture myself as being in combat.

297
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And so, of course, when I got my wings and then was assigned the F4 Phantom,

298
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
which at the time was a hottest airplane in the world.

299
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I mean, we had the time to climb records and speed records.

300
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And it's a twice as speed to sound airplane.

301
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And it was felt very fortunate to have been assigned that airplane.

302
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And so I came out here to San Diego to fly.

303
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And you were talking about in your book,

304
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
you'd done a midshipment tour where a Phantom went down,

305
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
both pilots killed.

306
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And then you got assigned the Phantom.

307
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I did.

308
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
That gave you any reservations at all?

309
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I don't remember being afraid of the airplane.

310
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
But I certainly gave it a lot of respect, especially around the ship.

311
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Because I saw this thing go down.

312
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
At the Naval Academy, in the summer time, you get exposed to the possible

313
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
buildings you might have in the future.

314
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
So we go play Marine for a while,

315
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
and we go to submarines for a while,

316
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
and we go aboard ships to be line officers for a while.

317
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And we go to Pensacola.

318
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And so I got a little touch of it there of actually being in airplanes.

319
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And then my senior crews, between my junior and senior year,

320
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I went aboard the constellation, the aircraft carrier constellation.

321
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And we were out of Sassabobu, Japan.

322
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And I'm watching flight-offs from the bridge.

323
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And so I'm looking down at this airplane launching and recovering

324
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
on this aircraft carrier.

325
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And a Phantom came in and actually broke the wire.

326
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
The pilot did okay, but he broke, he picked up the wire,

327
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
and the wire snapped.

328
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
This cable that traps an airplane is two and a half inches in diameter.

329
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
It's a very thick steel wire around.

330
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
K1 is a really, really strong.

331
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Because it has to stop this 35,000 pound airplane going down the

332
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
shoot at 170 miles per hour.

333
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
But for whatever reason, the cable broke.

334
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
The cable snapped around and it cut off the legs of three different

335
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
guys who were on the deck.

336
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
It was so fast that I couldn't even see it.

337
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
My eyes couldn't even follow this cable because it was just,

338
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I mean, there's so much pressure, so much energy involved.

339
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And then the airplane, the F4, was slowed down to the point where the

340
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
guy couldn't get it back in the air.

341
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And so it just dribbled off the bow of the aircraft carrier and

342
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
into the water.

343
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Well, of course, then I turn my view to the stern of the ship to see

344
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
if I could see what had happened, what had happened,

345
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
what had happened, what had been the few seconds that it took from

346
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
when it settled in the water until I could see out the back of the

347
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
ship.

348
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
It was gone.

349
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
There was no debris.

350
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
There was no oil.

351
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
There was nothing in the water behind this ship after this airplane

352
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
had gone down.

353
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
So it was a shock to me, of course.

354
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
But, you know, I think I started out with this mentality that

355
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
it's always going to happen to somebody else, you know, never me.

356
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And I'm, you know, whatever happened, I'm going to do it better.

357
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And, and I think that's, well, you know, it's better than I.

358
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
You have to kind of have that mentality in combat.

359
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
You can't go in thinking you're going to get killed.

360
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And so, so I, I wasn't reluctant to fly the F4, but I gave it.

361
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I, I think, respect.

362
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
So you get that and you come out your station in San Diego.

363
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Is that what's that San Diego, right?

364
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
For when you, when you deployed for the first time?

365
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
You're in the near-marnable air station.

366
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Yeah. And that's where I helped start top gun.

367
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
That was kind of an interesting experience as well.

368
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
There was a, there was a, a pool of students to fly the F4 Phantom.

369
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And I showed up here when they had about a six month waiting list

370
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
for me to find this airplane.

371
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Well, six months was a long time, you know, for a 23 year old kid.

372
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And I wanted to get in the air.

373
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
So a buddy of mine, Paul Krooky, and I had gotten our wings at the same time

374
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
and been assigned the F4 Phantom.

375
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
And we came out here and so we were both going to have to wait for six months to fly this airplane.

376
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000
So we wandered down the flight line at Miramar and found the instrument training squad

377
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and was flying the same airplane that we had flown in, in flight train

378
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
to the old F9, a Cougar, a Bentley airplane.

379
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
It's a jet that it's light and slow and kind of stodges.

380
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
It's a Korean warping.

381
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And they were, they were using it in flight training to teach instruments.

382
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And the way they did this, the instructor would sit in the front seat

383
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
and they'd sit in the back seat and they had it, a bag.

384
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
That covered all the windows covered you up.

385
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
All you could see was the instrument panel.

386
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
You're under this bag.

387
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And so we signed on to fly this airplane for test tops and check rides

388
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
and this kind of stuff, just to fly it, just to stay in the air.

389
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Because we were already qualified to the airplane.

390
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Well, Krooky and I would save a little bit of gas.

391
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Okay?

392
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Each time we'd fly these students around, then at the end of the hop,

393
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
we would lurk off the coast of San Diego and wait for the phantoms to come out.

394
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And so these guys would come off the runway at Miramar.

395
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
And they were heavy.

396
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
You know, and they were stodges and they were slow as they came off.

397
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And they'd get about four or five miles out in the Pacific

398
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
and we would pounce on these guys.

399
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And it was all kinds of fun because we were lighter and could turn quicker

400
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
than the phantoms.

401
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
You know, we were a smaller, we had a better wingload than they did.

402
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And so we could turn inside these guys.

403
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Of course, they were much, much faster.

404
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
We were not super-signing and they were.

405
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And so they could get away from us in a heartbeat if they wanted to.

406
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
But we started this air combat maneuvering with these guys.

407
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Well, that went on for, I don't know, a couple of months.

408
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Until one day, Krooky and I, I mean, we played the role.

409
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
We had white scarves, you know, and Snoopy goggles and the whole works.

410
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
One day we came back and the instruments quadrant and checked in our

411
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
airplanes back in and it was signing on the Baltimore Board.

412
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Plum Krooky report to the F4 Commanding Officer immediately.

413
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
We were in trouble.

414
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
So two guys and there's sweaty flight suits,

415
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
not gonna door of the Commanding Officer of the Phantom Squadron.

416
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I'll never forget this scene.

417
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
They got a comment and we opened the door.

418
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
This guy sits at a long desk, okay.

419
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And he's got glasses.

420
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And of course, he's an old old guy.

421
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
We were 23.

422
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
So, you know, he was probably 30, but he was the old guy.

423
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
You've ever talked to him.

424
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Yeah, right.

425
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And so he's sitting there talking to over the top of his glasses.

426
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
He's in a sweaty flight suit also,

427
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
which should have been our first indication.

428
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
He said, you guys out there and he F9s.

429
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Haslan, my fighter pilots, yes sir.

430
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
We were.

431
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Did you follow a Phantom through an entire loop?

432
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Yes sir, in fact we did.

433
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Did you have your gun sights on that Phantom the entire time?

434
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Yes sir, we did.

435
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
He said, do you know who was in that Phantom?

436
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
He said, I was.

437
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
He said, I just came back from Vietnam.

438
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Our kill ratio over there is terrible.

439
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
They're eating our lunch.

440
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
We need to learn how to fight this airplane.

441
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
See, the F4 was designed in the coal war as a supersonic intercept.

442
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
I was never called a fighter pilot.

443
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And in fact, I trained in a space suit.

444
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
So I could go above 50,000 feet.

445
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
You know, off the aircraft carrier, climb to 80,000 feet,

446
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
shoot down the Russian bombers and, you know, at 45 degree

447
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
angle of bank, turn, return to the aircraft carrier.

448
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
That was my job.

449
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I wasn't supposed to be out there.

450
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
I have a gasoline because it was a cold war.

451
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
We did not expect to have a Korean war war two-type

452
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
of the hassle of the fighter pilot.

453
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Well, of course Vietnam came around and suddenly, you know,

454
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
they're flying these older airplanes that were eaten in our lunch.

455
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
So the CO looked at us and he said, you want to fight with me tomorrow?

456
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Well, you're sure that'd be fun.

457
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
So for the next two or three months, Paul Kruk,

458
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
you know, with our white scarves and our snoopy goggles, we're getting

459
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
out of the left.

460
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
We had to start about an hour ahead of time, you know,

461
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
just because they were so fast.

462
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
But we'd get out to see, we'd go out to 40 miles out to see

463
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
and turn around and here they come.

464
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
And we'd have these two on two engagements.

465
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And that became a syllabus within the replacement air group

466
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
that eventually became the top-gence goal.

467
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
That's awesome.

468
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yeah, it was the start of retraining.

469
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Well, and it was very successful.

470
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
We turned our kill ratio around by teaching pilots how to fight

471
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
this air for a fandom.

472
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Yeah, clearly that's it.

473
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Without training to fight, how are you going to know how to fight?

474
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
That's right.

475
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
And you got to beat that's outstanding for the commanding officer

476
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
that squadron to say, you know what?

477
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Instead of being mad that you were doing it, instead of

478
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
you homelom said, you know what?

479
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
We need to get better with this.

480
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Yeah.

481
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Let's keep training.

482
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Yep.

483
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
That's awesome.

484
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And you eventually do get your time in the F4 fandom.

485
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
You learn how to fly that.

486
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And now it's time to go on deployment.

487
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
You're going on deployment.

488
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Now November 5th, 1966, you kiss Anne goodbye.

489
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
And you go on deployment on the on the Kitty Hawk.

490
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
It was her birthday.

491
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Oh, if that's a great birthday present.

492
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
That's right.

493
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Very nice of you.

494
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
It's like my first daughter.

495
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
My first daughter was born.

496
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Actual birthday.

497
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Like actual birthday.

498
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Yeah, I went on deployment the next day.

499
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Everyone was really happy with me on that one.

500
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
When now when you were going through the flight training, you were getting ready to

501
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
deploy.

502
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Now are you thinking about Vietnam and all?

503
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I mean, you must have been getting feedback.

504
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
You got feedback from commanding officer.

505
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So now are your focus had shifted some.

506
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Yeah, it's certainly head.

507
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
And the squadron that I joined was just coming back from Vietnam.

508
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And they'd had quite a few casualties.

509
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
And so they were talking about, you know, the guys were.

510
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
The guys were, we're giving us instruction on how to work.

511
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Another thing about the fandom was that we had, we had no indication when a missile was in the air.

512
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Because we were faster than the missile for the most part, our higher than the missile.

513
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And so one of the things the guys, the guys told me that the fellows coming back from Vietnam said,

514
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
go down to radio check by yourself, a buzzer, buzzer.

515
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
You know?

516
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Oh, like police detector.

517
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the old buzzer, buzzer, yeah.

518
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:07.000
He said because the Russian-built Sam surface to air missiles are on the same frequency as a California highway patrol.

519
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
True, true story.

520
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And so we have found that, because we have no indication in the air,

521
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
we're playing with the missiles in the air.

522
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
And so I did, now the radio check by myself, a buzzer.

523
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
And it had a little suction cup, you look the suction cup and you put it on the windscreen,

524
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
and this fan of him, you remember the white wire, you know, down underneath your G-suit,

525
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:43.000
your sort, torsual harness under your oxygen mask and finally into your air, you know, you get your air bud in there.

526
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
So here I am flying this $20 million airplane being protected by a $29 buzzer.

527
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000
So it worked, but the problem was there was no direction capability you couldn't tell where it was coming from.

528
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And so, you know, that's almost worse.

529
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
It was like, you know, it was like, you heard the verbal.

530
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And boy, you know, you started to turn and jink and, you know, you're head went on a swivel trying to figure out where this missile is.

531
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
But you get overseas and you're flying, you start flying missions.

532
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
You're doing mostly strike missions.

533
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Is that primarily what you're even taking out targets in North Vietnam?

534
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:36.000
The F4, of course, again, was considered, was configured and built from the keel up as an air to air combat machine.

535
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
All right, the powers that be decided, eight, there's an airplane we can hang a bomb on it.

536
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
They put on an extra, I believe, four hard points on the bottom of this airplane.

537
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Maybe five.

538
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Can't remember.

539
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
So that we could carry bombs on this fighter airplane.

540
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
What we were supposed to be, you know, interceptors.

541
00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000
We were supposed to be carrying bombs around, but we found out that sure enough, this big old airplane was a pretty good platform for dropping bombs.

542
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And so we could carry, you know, we could carry 12, 13,000 pounds of bombs into the target, which was a pretty good load.

543
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.000
You know, we could also support, you know, guys like you on the ground, that with all kinds of various kinds of weapon rate.

544
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And so what happened was we had a sister squadron on the aircraft carrier.

545
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
So for a month-line period, we would be fighters for two weeks.

546
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And then we would, we would reconfigure our airplane to be bombers.

547
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
And we'd be bombers for two weeks.

548
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And we would go back to fighters and then back to bombers.

549
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
So, to ask your question, half the time over there, I was dropping bombs.

550
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And half the time, I was doing the air to air mission.

551
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And the air to air mission primarily would be doing combat air patrols to support the other elements that were flying in with bombs.

552
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And you'd be protecting in case any make showed up.

553
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Exactly.

554
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Yeah, it was a CAP, a cap, combat air patrol.

555
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
So, you're pretty much almost done with deployment.

556
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Where we're talking, you spend, you did what 74 missions at this point.

557
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
You've been there for five or coming up on six months.

558
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And on the 19th and May 1967, you get a phone call.

559
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
And you guys get like a strike mission comes in that you are supposed to execute.

560
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
It was a big deal.

561
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And it was called an alpha strike.

562
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
An alpha strike was the top priority.

563
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
And we knew that it would be a lot of airplanes in the air.

564
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And we have some pretty important targets to hit.

565
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And it was sanctions straight from the Pentagon.

566
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
It was JCS stuff.

567
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And which of course is one of the problems in that war was that most of our instruction came from the guys back in the puzzle palace.

568
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:03.000
And they wouldn't let us decide targets or altitudes or anything else.

569
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
It was pretty well planned by the time we got the go.

570
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
And I got a call.

571
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
I suppose three in the morning something like that.

572
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Saying that I was to schedule this flight.

573
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I was a schedules officer for the squadron.

574
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
And so I was the guy that figured out who went on what strikes and who went with who and

575
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
the air planes had to head.

576
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And so I got up early to start planning this strike with the airplanes and the pilots and the back seaters are radar intercept officers are co-pilets.

577
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And so I did.

578
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And we went to the briefing room and got about a hour brief on these targets.

579
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I later found out that the reason for the whole thing, the reason why we are doing it in alpha strike in the 19th of May,

580
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
was it was the birthday of their president Ho Chi Minh.

581
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:07.000
And again, the, you know, the brilliant of our, our side, our side war.

582
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Great.

583
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
It was that we would catch them in celebration of their, of the big day because they,

584
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
it was like our president's day.

585
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
They have picnics and that kind of stuff.

586
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And so we were going to catch them with their pants down.

587
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Well, as most things that happened to Vietnam, they knew we were coming for whatever reason.

588
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
And that day they were eight F4 fanom shot down.

589
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
But I'll never forget the beginning of it because, you know, I took off and,

590
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000
and I ran to boot with a tanker and took on an extra 3000 pounds of fuel and then joined the squadron.

591
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
And it was, in fact, the cat mission, it was a combat air patrol.

592
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I was not carrying bombs.

593
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
And so we had four of us on one side of the strike group and four of the other.

594
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And just to look, because it was, it was three aircraft carriers and five air force paces.

595
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
All, it was just throwing everything we had at the end of me that day.

596
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
It was, it was an amazing armata.

597
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
And I could see from one horizon to the other, these airplanes.

598
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And I remember feeling really proud, you know, man, you know, just to be a part of this,

599
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
doing something that very few people in the world would ever do.

600
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
And flying this airplane at age 24.

601
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And so that was how it all began on the 19th of May.

602
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000
One of the things that we were talking about just before we hit record was the kind of the sense of humor

603
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
that you have in the military and what that's like.

604
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
And one of the, by the way, I haven't even mentioned that referring to a book that you wrote called

605
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
I'm No Hero by Charlie Plum.

606
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
And that'll be that's available on Amazon, get it through and be link on the website.

607
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
But also book, actually better on my website because I sign everyone that goes out.

608
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
So my website, CharliePrem.com.

609
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Okay.

610
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Well, there you go.

611
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Even better.

612
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Go into the book here. You guys are getting before you launch, you're getting ready to launch,

613
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
kind of getting ready for the briefing. And here we go.

614
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
The pilots of the fighter planes gathered in their own briefing room and read from a television screen

615
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
and tell a type, the weather information and the position of the ship.

616
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
We reviewed once again the switches we would have to throw and I coordinated with the maintenance officer,

617
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
the weapons we would need, the volume of the fuel, etc.

618
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Serious thoughts were in the back of all our minds, but outwardly our mood was light.

619
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
We laughed and joked, drank coffee and smoked.

620
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
My regular Rio, which is the radar intercept officer, is their backseater because the F4 Phantom has two people,

621
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
was up to his old habit of manipulating his slide rule.

622
00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Being a self-styled math wizard, he again pinpointed his likelihood of getting bagged, shut down.

623
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
This was based on some speculative formula he had found somewhere.

624
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Today friends, he proclaimed, my bag factor is 019376.

625
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
And then you replied to him, then save me a room at the Hanoi Hilton.

626
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Again, I'm glad you're still laughing about that sir.

627
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
The rest of you as we go through this book, we'll see the true irony in that joke.

628
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Back to the book, here we left our reddy room and entered the central briefing room.

629
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
We're all the pilots, reels and standby crew scrutinized their master plan, which included maps and photographs of the targets and intelligence,

630
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
reports of enemies, fire capability.

631
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
After our central briefing, we returned to our reddy room, meditated, last-mitted instructions, and put on our flight gear.

632
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
All together, these briefings took as long and sometimes longer than the mission itself.

633
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
I looked up at the screen, pilots, man, your aircraft, we gave each other.

634
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:09.000
We stopped each other on the back, exchanged a customary, give them hell, dialogue, and padded the posterior of our good luck girl hanging on the door.

635
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
It was time to go topside.

636
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
You guys are now getting ready to take off.

637
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And again, just some of this humor back to the book, engine run up is good.

638
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Take off checklist is complete. I'm ready to go Gary, you ready? Y'all ready?

639
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Okay, I'm mocked. This is your captain speaking.

640
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Welcome to Flight 403 to Hanoi, North Vietnam.

641
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
We'll be flying an altitude of 11 grand and we have a high ceiling.

642
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Make sure your seat belt is fastened.

643
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
No smoking, please.

644
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
So that's the attitude going out.

645
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And legitimately, this is your 75th mission. You've flown 74.

646
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000
You're feeling pretty comfortable. I mean, even though of course, you've got thoughts in the back of your mind, but you're feeling pretty comfortable about how you do your job and what you get done.

647
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
I am feeling bulletproof.

648
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I wasn't going to go that far, but let's just go there.

649
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I know that feeling too.

650
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Yep.

651
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
As you push in back to the book, all this coordination.

652
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
So it's what you just talked about this massive effort going forward.

653
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
The captain doesn't have aircraft. All of this coordination of men and machinery during the refueling was done in complete silence.

654
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:30.000
We called it Zip Lip. Although enemy radar would have already detected us, we were careful not to give radio spooks any additional information.

655
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
It was gratifying to experience such close rapport with my air wing.

656
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.000
I knew and they knew what each was doing in this intricate maneuver yet not a word had to be spoken.

657
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
And that's, I've actually talked about that on here when we would train.

658
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And when I was running training for the seals, I would tell them, hey, you're not allowed to talk during this train machine.

659
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
You can't say one word to each other.

660
00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
And it was amazing. After you do that a couple times, how much better people get because they're reading, they're anticipating what other people are going to do.

661
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And you guys are just so far ahead at this point, five and a half months into deployment.

662
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
You guys are doing this whole thing without saying a word to each other.

663
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
It was amazing.

664
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Yeah, I think that's one of the one of the incredible things about the military is even though you're just a little piece of that big machine, this big powerful machine.

665
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:28.000
It's, it's pretty awesome to experience when that stuff's going on.

666
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:36.000
And you kind of talked about what you were doing, you were positioned on the flanks and anticipating makes, how often do you guys see a meggzover there?

667
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
But not often, I had seen meggzover probably four or five times up to that point.

668
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:51.000
And so they, they really were, they were really good about not showing up until they knew that they could kill something.

669
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
You know, of course they were, they had the advantage, they had the home field advantage.

670
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And so they could wait on their bases until we came to them and then they would launch.

671
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
So if you didn't get close to a meggzover, you probably weren't going to see one.

672
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
They were, they had a very short range.

673
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And they didn't see in the air very long.

674
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And so we didn't see him very often.

675
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
And on this one, you get a call though, you hear, they don't, they give you call for those meggs.

676
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
What is it, meggs is 20, 20 West.

677
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
And you start to get a little aggressive start leading out that way a little bit.

678
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Yep, yep.

679
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And the, and this, the flight commander, tightened you up and said,

680
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

681
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000
My, my best buddy there, Danny wisely, had already shot down two airplanes by that time.

682
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
And he shot down another one after I was shot down.

683
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
And so he, and you know, I mean, that's what every fighter pilot wants to, you know,

684
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
to have a megg to his credit.

685
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
And I saw this opportunity, you know, five days to go, you know, this is my, this is my day.

686
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
You know, this is Charlie Plum Day.

687
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
So I started to ease out of the squadron so that I would be the first to go after this megg.

688
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
And, you know, we plumbed, we're going to get his.

689
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
What happens?

690
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
But no, that, that, that's how it began.

691
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
And they, and they taught you back up.

692
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
So you fall back into formation.

693
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
And now, there's a, is there a Sam call?

694
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Did you pick it up on the, on the buzzbuster?

695
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
I did, but there were a lot of them in the air.

696
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
And, and, and, and so that thing was warbling all the time.

697
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Um, they were, they were, they were salvoing their Sam's that day.

698
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
They just, they just shoot a bunch of them off at the same time.

699
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And so every time they shot one off, and every time their radar would scan me,

700
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
I would get to buzzbuster.

701
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
But we also had, you know, we had the, um, the, the big radar airplanes in the sky at the same time.

702
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
And, and, and, and they would call us.

703
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
And, and that's how I got that call.

704
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:11.000
The 20 mile away call was was was from our, our, our electronic folks that were flying well above us with the radar.

705
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
So you know that there's Sam surf Sarah missiles up there.

706
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
And here we go back to the book, Gary, that's your, that's your real sitting behind you in the plane.

707
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
He said, Gary, do you see it?

708
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
And he says, I don't see a thing Charlie.

709
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
We had both seen Sam's before.

710
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:36.000
They resembled flying white telephone poles with huge fourth of July sparklers, spring, silvery orange glow from their tails.

711
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
If we saw them in time, we could dodge the missiles by letting them close in.

712
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
At the last second, pulling the plane into a high G barrel roll, six G's or so,

713
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
and letting the poles pass harmlessly underneath.

714
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Because if it's designed, the missile could not follow us without cracking into.

715
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
But we didn't see it.

716
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Boom.

717
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I felt the bump in the impenage, the half section of the airplane.

718
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Red instrument lights jumped across the panel indicating that I had two engines on fire.

719
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
That wasn't good.

720
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
This plane only had two engines.

721
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I yanked the throttles back to idle, and the bird seemed to come to an immediate halt in mid air.

722
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Charlie, where hit, how bad is it?

723
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
She still flying.

724
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Then the aircraft started to roll, and while I madly scanned the instruments,

725
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
I looked up and found that the F4 had suddenly overturned.

726
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Ground was where there was where there should have been sky,

727
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
and the nose was heading downward, ripping air at 500 knots.

728
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
The Altimeter needle collapsed to 4,000, then 3500, then 3000.

729
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000
We had to get out, but being inverted, we would be rocketed by the ejection seat right into the rice patties.

730
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
I had to roll the plane upright.

731
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I tried this stick, it was frozen.

732
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
The only manual control was the rudder pedal, not normally used to roll an aircraft.

733
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
I stepped on it as hard as I could, adrenaline surging through my veins.

734
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000
The plane shuddered once, and again slowly hit, it began to write itself.

735
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Rear view mirrors reflected a screaming fireball, 12,000 pounds of flaming gasoline and 30,000 pounds of

736
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
fissionable aircraft.

737
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
You want to eject?

738
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
No way to min it, I shouted back.

739
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
The plane struggled, then the sky was where it should be.

740
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Gary, let's go.

741
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
I jerked my face curtain to eject, the rocket slammed me out of the aircraft.

742
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
I tumble a couple times, and the shoot caught just as advertised.

743
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
All kinds of debris filled the air around me, as wadding from the shells whistled by.

744
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Son of a gun, they've bagged my airplane, now they're after me.

745
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I went to the concussions from the exploding shells, sonic booms battering my ear drums,

746
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
rockets of heavy smoke, clouded the sky.

747
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Gary and I had ejected, ejected so near the ground, however, that enemy guns could train on us

748
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
for only a short time.

749
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I checked my parachute canopy, it looked good, torn in only a couple of places.

750
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
I fought of escape, but where?

751
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Looking away, I saw my buddies and their aircraft blending into the horizon.

752
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Below, my landing zone was nothing but bear in rice patties.

753
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Down to my left a huge cloud of black smoke, billowed at the outskirts of a peasant hamlet,

754
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:37.000
punctuating a row of four or five huts, my plane had it wiped out of family.

755
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
If so, the villagers would certainly be unhappy.

756
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
I wasn't happy either, I hadn't intended that to happen.

757
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
I later learned that the plane had impacted just beyond the last shack on the road.

758
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
There was precious little time before I could touch it down, before I would touch down,

759
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
and I had much to be done.

760
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
I grabbed my two-way radio and tried to counter Gary, but I received no answer.

761
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Then I called my skipper, Lynn Field Lead, Lynn Field Lead, this is Lynn Field 2.

762
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
We've got two good shoots.

763
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
We're going to be all right.

764
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Request no-sar effort.

765
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And Sars searching rescue for those either don't know.

766
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000
And when I read that part right there, I'd stop them by tracks because here you are.

767
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
You shot down, you're going to parachute, you're going to obviously be landing in these rice patties.

768
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Surrounded by enemy.

769
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000
And you had the where we're fall to understand that if you requested for a search and rescue to come and get you,

770
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
it was just going to get more people killed.

771
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Yeah.

772
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
And that had happened before.

773
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
I had seen that happen.

774
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And we were so far behind enemy lines.

775
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I mean, it was impossible.

776
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
A jolly green was a call sign for the helicopter that would come get us off the aircraft carrier.

777
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:17.000
And they would have to go through a probably 75 or 100 miles of enemy territory before they ever got to me.

778
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And I was in such a populated area that I could see that they were, that I was going to be captured immediately.

779
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And so to get those guys, the butthemen harms way was kind of silly.

780
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
So that's why I did that.

781
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
When you know, I've experienced a couple times in combat where things slow down.

782
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
And the time starts to really be different than it normally is.

783
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.000
And they say it's because you get this big adrenaline dump and all of your sensors, all your perception awakens to such a high point that things actually slow down.

784
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Did you experience any of that when you were once that Sam missile hit?

785
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
I did.

786
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Yes.

787
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
It was almost like slow motion.

788
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
And I, you know, I remember thinking this is unreal.

789
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I've never had this happen to me before, but it was almost like I was in a, it was in a movie and everything was slowing down in my life.

790
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And I, you know, I tried to sense every possible thing because of course I'm thinking to escape now trying to get it out of here in some way.

791
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:30.000
And so I'm trying to memorize all the little roads I could see in all the little trees and all the little huts and where are they and where am I that situ situational awareness?

792
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
How far from the water in the ocean where you at this level?

793
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
I was 75 miles.

794
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
No chance.

795
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
No chance.

796
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
We won the outskirts of Hanor the capital city.

797
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And, and that was the bad news good news.

798
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
The bad news was that I was going to be captured immediately.

799
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
There was no chance whatsoever. I mean, they were shooting at me from the ground while I came down.

800
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
The good news was that I didn't have to go very far to a formalized prison camp.

801
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Like a lot of the guys did, you know, you had Bill Reader on this on your podcast and he was dragged for, I don't know, weeks.

802
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000
And because he was, he was captured in South Vietnam.

803
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Right.

804
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
The guys that were going to allow Sir Cambodia who were brought to our prison camps were all just really torn up.

805
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Not just because of the enemy, but just because of the rigors of the travel.

806
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
So, and you're going to, you're going to talk about this.

807
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:39.000
You talk about it in the book, but, you know, just to kind of point out the fact that whatever two minutes earlier,

808
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:46.000
you were part of this giant powerful force with a multi-million dollar, you know, aircraft under the water.

809
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:55.000
You know, aircraft under your command is a 24 year old as part of this group that of many, many multi-million dollar with this huge, destructive power,

810
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.000
launching off of these ships and airfields, and to go from having all that.

811
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.000
To now you're under a parachute and you're about to have all of that just absolutely taken away.

812
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
It was a major transition in my life.

813
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:25.000
You know, unlike someone who's diagnosed with cancer or, like someone who just lost a job or just lost a child or just had a car accident,

814
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:34.000
I mean, there are similarities in normal civilian life, I think that can be just as impactive as being blown out of the sky.

815
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:42.000
You're floating down to earth and I'm going back to the book, and then I bowed my head, well Lord, here I am.

816
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
I'm really in a bind now, and I need some help.

817
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Give me strength and give it an strength.

818
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:57.000
I was surprised at how calm I was when I should have been pan-extricant, but there was too much to think about and do.

819
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
I couldn't let myself become irrational.

820
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000
It would all be different now. I tried to envision myself in this new world and prepare for it.

821
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:13.000
I had a lot going for me. I was in good physical condition, and I could probably withstand torture.

822
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:23.000
I didn't believe I would be killed because I was too much of a blue chip for the enemy, which, again, for you to say,

823
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000
you're shot down, you're about to land an enemy territory, and you're statement as I had a lot going for me.

824
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
It's a positive attitude, sir. It's a positive attitude.

825
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
That's your philosophy of saying good.

826
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
That's my notes right there.

827
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Good.

828
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Good.

829
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
That's not this before.

830
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000
So you touched down a plunge backward into the mud and water.

831
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Trying to get my bearings. I took off my helmet and mass and crawled out, crawled without direction in the quagmire.

832
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
With slimy hands, I tried to wipe mud from my eyes. I saw that I was about 10 or 15 yards from an embankment.

833
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:06.000
I looked over to see that Gary, touching down her in adjacent patty about 100 yards away, had disappeared behind the eight foot embankment.

834
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:15.000
A barefoot peasant wearing khaki shirts, shorts and t-shirt, ran at top speed down the path toward me grimacing with excitement and anger.

835
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Above his head, he waved a double-edged axe with blades about eight inches long.

836
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000
My instructor's never documented that type of weapon.

837
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
I heard him scream, hand up, hand up.

838
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
I didn't understand what he meant and I kept working with my gear and shoot.

839
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000
I had a 38 revolver strapped to my chest and as long as he stayed in the embankment, I would not touch it.

840
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
It wasn't long however before 10 or 12 more peasants came rushing toward me, yelling and waving their shovels and hose.

841
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Now there was power and numbers and they charged out in the water after me. I raised my hands away from my body.

842
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.000
They started ripping my g-suit, found my survival knife and proceeded to cut away at the suit and the torso harness.

843
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I tried to tell them to use the zippers and even attempted to show them how to do it, but they knocked my hands away.

844
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
The more certain they were that I was harmless, the meaner they became.

845
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.000
The shovel and whole blades flailed at my body to prove to me that I was there to load the captain.

846
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Captive.

847
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Strangely, the peasants failed to see my revolver.

848
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Probably because it too was covered with mud and the 38 rested in my holster at least three or four minutes before a peasant finally spotted it.

849
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
He yanked it out of the holster and sloshed a few steps away.

850
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
A moment later he returned and screamed for special attention.

851
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
He fixed the barrel to my head.

852
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
I could see that at least two of the chambers were empty.

853
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:55.000
I had always kept five of the six chambers loaded so I knew that he must have removed at least one of the cartridges.

854
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
There was little I could do as I felt the muddy barrel against my temple.

855
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
The peasant pulled the trigger.

856
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Click. He could fall and sneak away wiping off his unexpected prize.

857
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Your...

858
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
As far as your thoughts about being killed at that moment,

859
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000
did you accept them? Were you used to stinking? He's not going to do it.

860
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
What you're out of to at that point?

861
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
I never...

862
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
In the entire experience and never thought I was going to be killed.

863
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
And I didn't think so at that moment.

864
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Of course, I was very happy that I heard the click of that revolver.

865
00:56:49.000 --> 00:57:01.000
But it was actually very encouraging to think that they were going to fain this execution and not go through with it.

866
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Right.

867
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
And it was encouraging to think that they were going to hammer me around and get me pretty bloody.

868
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
But they probably weren't intentionally going to kill me.

869
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
I guess I worried more about that they would kill me accidentally.

870
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
But then intentionally.

871
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
But there were two or three times during the entire experience.

872
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
One of them as well as being tortured.

873
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
When I felt like I was losing that I was close to death.

874
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000
And they loosened the ropes because they saw.

875
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000
I think that I was getting pretty close to death.

876
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
And that again, that was good.

877
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Because I thought, all right, this is her.

878
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000
It's a lot.

879
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
But it looks like they're not going to kill me.

880
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I may wish I was dead, but I don't think they're going to do it.

881
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Now you guys are blindfolded.

882
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
They take after Gary as well.

883
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
And you're blindfolded.

884
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
But at this point they put this kind of marginal blindfold on you.

885
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
That's not working really well.

886
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000
So you can actually see.

887
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
And again, I'm going to go to your...

888
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Go ahead and highlight your twisted sense of humor here.

889
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
So here we go.

890
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
You're in the back of an old Russian Jeep.

891
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Back to the book.

892
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Gary was held captive in the Jeep ahead of mine.

893
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
At the instant I recognized Gary, I started calling

894
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Historically for a doctor to attend to his burned arms.

895
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000
The guards restrained me violently, screaming foreign

896
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
But distinct warnings to attempt no more communication.

897
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
I did however shout one more thing.

898
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
I don't know why unless it was from a rail.

899
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
I shouted out these people are a thousand years behind in blindfolds.

900
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:52.000
It says later the POWs who were nearby cells heard, heard you screaming

901
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
that and still laughed about it.

902
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
So I'm glad you kept your sense of humor.

903
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
You know, sometimes I look back on that and think that I...

904
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
That I was in some form of shock.

905
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Right.

906
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Because I mean, who would come up with that?

907
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Who would write this stuff?

908
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
And they bring you in.

909
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000
They kind of parade you guys around and you hear cameras clicking

910
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
and eventually you get put into new guy village and you get put into,

911
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
you know, a torture basically a torture room.

912
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000
So here you go back to the book.

913
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Several torture cells in the prison.

914
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
The green knobby room.

915
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
So called because the walls and ceiling were covered with gobs of plaster

916
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
and the size of golf balls which looked somewhat like mud dober nests.

917
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
The globs had a particular function, acoustics,

918
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
to muffle human sound.

919
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Now you get through this day sunset.

920
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
I had difficulty in seeing what was beyond myself.

921
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
So I began reminiscing about the world of active life.

922
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I had loved so much.

923
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Outside, my every minute had been filled.

924
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Outside, I had been king of the skies.

925
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Outside, I had been continually learning, doing,

926
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
accomplishing.

927
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I had been proud.

928
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So very proud.

929
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And now I was tired.

930
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000
So tired, so perplexed, so confined, so very lonely.

931
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The trauma of overwhelming changed,

932
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
caused my mind to reel with this orientation.

933
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I was afraid.

934
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I stared at the emptiness.

935
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Shadows crept up the walls gradually becoming more pronounced.

936
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Curiously, a vague ghost-like impression materialized.

937
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The image took the appearance of the master

938
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
with arms outstretched, a symbol.

939
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It was strange, yet something I felt I should expect.

940
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I began to utter the first lines of the 23rd Psalm.

941
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The Lord is my shepherd.

942
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I shall not want.

943
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
He makeeth me to lie down in green pastures.

944
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

945
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
He restoreeth my soul.

946
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name, sake.

947
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I repeated it aloud several times,

948
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
not because of any deep religious drive,

949
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
but because it simply seemed the thing to do.

950
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And then I prayed.

951
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I considered making a deal with God,

952
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
but rejected the idea.

953
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I made no big promises and asked for no miracles,

954
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
just strength.

955
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Strength to endure the hardship and strength from my wife and

956
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
my wife.

957
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
It would be difficult for her to.

958
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yay, though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death.

959
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That was certainly where I was.

960
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
An interesting point here is that in Colonel Wieders podcast,

961
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
you found the same thing that he went to the 23rd Psalm.

962
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And again, it was just almost like,

963
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
well, this is what I should do.

964
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Well, I say there's no atheists and foxholes,

965
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and I guess there aren't any in the prison camp.

966
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Although you do talk about some atheists in the prison camp.

967
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I do, it's a matter of fact, a couple of guys,

968
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
consider themselves atheists.

969
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And you also talk about faith and one of the things that I will get to this,

970
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
but when you talk about faith, you talk about faith,

971
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
not just in God, but faith in your country and the one that I think

972
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
that regardless of what someone's religious beliefs are,

973
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
faith in yourself.

974
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Absolutely.

975
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And I think all three of those are whatever one of those faiths,

976
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
where you find strength in time like this, lean on it.

977
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Absolutely.

978
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And faith in the team as well.

979
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And we had to have faith in each other.

980
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And then that was awfully important to be a part of a group like that,

981
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
that could trust one another.

982
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
How quickly did you realize that there was,

983
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
that you were part of,

984
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I guess we'll get to it.

985
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
But I mean, when you first got your in this room,

986
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
did you feel completely isolated at first?

987
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
There's no one out here?

988
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
No, no, I knew that two other prisoners there.

989
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I could hear them.

990
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Some of them were being tortured as I was.

991
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I could hear the torture.

992
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
But I could peek out sometimes and see them walking by myself.

993
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So I knew there were other prisoners in the area.

994
01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
They just wouldn't let me, they wouldn't let me talk to them.

995
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So the interrogation begins.

996
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
The torture begins.

997
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
We're going back to the book.

998
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
We read Copy Regulations, You Obey.

999
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
You live.

1000
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
No trouble.

1001
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I did not respond.

1002
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
First regulation, you answer all question.

1003
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
The way that the North Vietnamese justified torture was peculiar.

1004
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
When they asked me questions and wanted military answers,

1005
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I was not tortured to answer questions,

1006
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
but punished for disobeying camp regulations.

1007
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
What, what airplane you fly?

1008
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm sorry.

1009
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I can't tell you.

1010
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Lamb, and they were calling you lamb.

1011
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
What airplane?

1012
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
To answer this question was of course, not in my rules.

1013
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I'm sorry.

1014
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I can't answer that.

1015
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
The officer again reminded me about the punishment for disobeying camp rules.

1016
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Okay.

1017
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
You talk to me or you talk steel to which you responded,

1018
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
bring it on.

1019
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The two higher of ranking officials left.

1020
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The remaining officer with one word ordered the guards forward.

1021
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
They brought it on.

1022
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
The steel mentioned by the interrogator consisted of iron manacles,

1023
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
shackles, and a leg bar.

1024
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The shackles were cylindrical.

1025
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Iron bars shaped like horseshoes, but rounded at the end so that the five foot leg bar

1026
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
could be slipped into them and locked.

1027
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
The prisoner's ankles could then be forced to the openings

1028
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
and secured by the bar.

1029
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
The junior officer walked out.

1030
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Guards blindfolded me, forced my wrist behind my back and placed the open jaws,

1031
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
the manacles around them.

1032
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
These had obviously been intended for the more modest Vietnamese arms.

1033
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
They were so small that they had to be forced together just so the screw

1034
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
could be seated in the bottom of the threads.

1035
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
With what looked like a roller skate key, a guard began to turn the screw.

1036
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000
My skin was pinched between the metal and quickly succumbed to the vice.

1037
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I screamed in agony.

1038
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Surely the guards wouldn't get these things much tighter.

1039
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Blood oozed down my hands and still the guard kept turning the key.

1040
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Like powerful magnets, the iron was finally set flush.

1041
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Circulation stopped.

1042
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
My hands burned.

1043
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Grayish blew.

1044
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Tangled.

1045
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And became numb.

1046
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.000
A guard then wrapped the rope first around my left elbow and then around my right and drew my elbows together behind my back.

1047
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
My shoulder muscles writhed.

1048
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
And I feared that my sternum would separate.

1049
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I gasped for air.

1050
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Then I was thrown abruptly to the floor.

1051
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Shackles were jammed around my ankles and the leg bar was fastened and padlocked.

1052
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Electric wire similar to the kind that I had hidden underneath the table was brought forward.

1053
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I thought that the guards were going to use this to shock me, but typical of the Vietnamese.

1054
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
They didn't have anything else to use for rope.

1055
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And it torn the wire down from some light fixtures.

1056
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
This became the apparatus to wrap me up.

1057
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000
It was first tied to the manacles, then thrown over my shoulder and at last secured to the shackles around my ankles.

1058
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Guards forced a bamboo pole under the wire and started rotating it so that the wire contracted,

1059
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
bringing my wrists up high on my back and drawing my face completely to my ankles.

1060
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I was a human pretzel.

1061
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000
A teacup with arms for a handle and the rest of my distorted body for the ball.

1062
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Circulation was impaired throughout my limbs making them extremely painful to the touch.

1063
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
The guards apparently drugged, exhibited wide and glassy eyes.

1064
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:19.000
They maliciously kicked me in the sides, the limbs, the back and the head giggling, and having a great time.

1065
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
They picked me up a few feet from the floor dropped me.

1066
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Since I was on my side most of the time, they especially enjoyed standing on my head, symbolically victorious.

1067
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
The rubber tires saw sandals tore up my ear.

1068
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
My face already target for abusers repeatedly subjected to fist-to-cuffs and kicks.

1069
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I remember staring at the floor and seeing my tears drop and pulls the blood coming from my nose.

1070
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
The louder I screamed, the more they flailed.

1071
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
After about an hour, the junior officer returned.

1072
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
You talk now?

1073
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Yes.

1074
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The guards loosened the wires and ropes, blood rushed back into my veins with knife and pain.

1075
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
What airplane you fly?

1076
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I hesitated a moment at the thought.

1077
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Well, they know the airplane I'm flying, and so ridiculous to undergo such torture for information they already have.

1078
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
The F4B.

1079
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That part right there, I mean, will you hesitate for a moment?

1080
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And then you say to yourself, okay, these guys shot me down in an F4, which crashed into this patty,

1081
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
and they know exactly what I was flying.

1082
01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:02.000
This is not makes sense for me to get this kind of abuse and torture for something that they already know.

1083
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And when you came to that conclusion, how did you, did you, was it pretty,

1084
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
were you feeling comfortable with it in your mind when you came to close your look?

1085
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
This is stupid.

1086
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
No, I was really never comfortable at all in that, I felt very guilty.

1087
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I was really, really, it was very remorseful that I had not been as strong as I wanted to be.

1088
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And through the, you know, the first several months of that experience, I felt like I felt very guilty about having given up.

1089
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
You know, fighter pilots are not supposed to give up.

1090
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000
You know, we were, but this, and the code of conduct, of course, name rank, serial number data birth.

1091
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And I flew over this, the enemy thinking that I was strong enough, and I was good enough.

1092
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And suddenly I was thrust into this situation.

1093
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And I even wondered, would I, would I ever be able to go back to my country?

1094
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Can I face my fellow fighter pilots that were stronger, you know, a tougher?

1095
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And I found out that that, that feeling was across the board.

1096
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Every, every POW that I ever went into felt guilty.

1097
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And some guys even considered suicide because they felt like they could, they could never live with the guilt of having given up.

1098
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And it was, it was quite a revelation to me when I finally made contact with another prisoner.

1099
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And confessed to this guy, I remember that my first contact, and I said, I need to confess something to you.

1100
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And when I tell you what I've done, you mean not want to communicate with me.

1101
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You may hate me. And if our roles were reversed, I would probably hate you if you did what I did.

1102
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Because I assumed that I was the only one that ever gave in.

1103
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
And so he said, this is Bob Schumacher.

1104
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
He said, what do you do, Plum? I said, well, I broke.

1105
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I tried to be strong, but I was my broke.

1106
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And his response, and we're talking on the end of a wire.

1107
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:26.000
We're talking on a wire to communicate with each other with this secret code that he had just taught me.

1108
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
He said, hell, everybody broke.

1109
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
He said, there's not a man in this camp that is as strong as he wanted to be.

1110
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
He said, so get over yourself.

1111
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And that was a great revelation in my mind, you know, to know that I wasn't the only one that had given in.

1112
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:56.000
As you continue this, and again, you might have felt like you broke at this point,

1113
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000
but there's still some unbelievable spirit that you show.

1114
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And I'm going back to the book around the courtyard in a nearby room.

1115
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
My copilot Gary Anderson was undergoing about the same treatment.

1116
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
As soon as I heard him exploding obscenities, I knew he was near.

1117
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Hey, Gary, you all right, I called the guards or immediately on top,

1118
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
kicking and striking. Gary heard me and yelled back.

1119
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It was four years later that it came across a POW who had been in a cell close to ours at the time.

1120
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
He said, boy, that was one of the craziest things I ever heard.

1121
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
You yelling, hey, Gary, are you all right?

1122
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Bang, crunch, fud.

1123
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Fine, how about you?

1124
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Smack, crash, crack.

1125
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Yeah.

1126
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:59.000
You eventually get, they're going to take you and kind of parade you in front of Vietnamese people.

1127
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And going back to the book, the officer briefed me once more.

1128
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I was to walk with my head down until he gave me the command, let people see face.

1129
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The guards removed the cops and I pump my hands and twitch my shoulders to restore circulation.

1130
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
The guards carefully directed me to the door, removing the blindfold and warn me not to look around.

1131
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
They then prodded me down the hallway line with photographers and journalists.

1132
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
A group composed of orientals and a few Caucasians.

1133
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000
With the officer at my side, I walked out of the building onto the patio where a battery of motion cameras started worrying.

1134
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
The officer shouted to me, let people see face.

1135
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Slowly and deliberately I looked up, staring blankly into space, bow deeply to the cameras and lowered my head.

1136
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I was uneasy about this entire charade, feeling a combination of resentment and embarrassment at being featured as a side's show attraction.

1137
01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And what I didn't know at the time was it was Ho Chi Minh's birthday.

1138
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And so that was part of the celebration was I was being presented to the president of their country.

1139
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So it was birthday gift popping out of a cake.

1140
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And the good news was that I was in the media that they were taking pictures of me.

1141
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And so after a few months my family saw those pictures.

1142
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And so that was the good news about being shot down in the 19th of May.

1143
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So that was the first indication that people knew that you were actually okay.

1144
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Or you were alive.

1145
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Maybe not okay.

1146
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
The stronger it didn't mean to say okay.

1147
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
You were alive.

1148
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:54.000
The picture that was taken and transferred to my family has me with my eyes closed.

1149
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And my face was pretty well swollen.

1150
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And my little brother thought that I was dead.

1151
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
He thought that was a picture of a dead man.

1152
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000
So but I think most people thought, yeah, no, he's alive.

1153
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So you actually got, how did you get stabbed?

1154
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Beineted.

1155
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
So you were about to fall or something?

1156
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Actually I was being prodded to walk faster by these guys.

1157
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I was hurting at the time.

1158
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I was injured from the ejection.

1159
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And I wasn't able to walk very fast.

1160
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And I was blindfolded as well.

1161
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And so I hit a, I hit a rut in the road.

1162
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And these guards with their bayonet fixed behind me,

1163
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
stabbed me in the thigh.

1164
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And so that was, in fact that was the worst wound that I had.

1165
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And it festered for months because I had no medical care.

1166
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And, but I never really knew if it was intentional or if it was accidental.

1167
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
But that was, that was how I got that wound.

1168
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Now you get back in and they're going to give you,

1169
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000
they give you the rules for the first time that you're supposed to follow.

1170
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And the, the guy reads into your, and I'm just going to,

1171
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I got to read these rules because I think they give a good indication as to what you were facing.

1172
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Here we go back to the book.

1173
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
You are the blackest criminal that this country has ever seen.

1174
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
But due to the lenient, he made policy of the Vietnamese people.

1175
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
You follow regulations you live in peace.

1176
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Regulation number one, criminals must give full and complete answers to questions asked by Vietnamese guard or officer.

1177
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Number two, criminals must make no noise in room.

1178
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Number three, criminals must keep room clean and neat and must not mark room so graciously given by Vietnamese people.

1179
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Number four, criminals must get up and go to bed at sound of gong.

1180
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Number five, criminals must get under bed when imperialist aggressor bomb and stray from the city.

1181
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
And stray from our sovereign country.

1182
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Number six, criminals must say, Baal Kao, when they want to ask anything.

1183
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Number seven, criminals must go only in area that guard orders when they go outside of room.

1184
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Number eight, criminals must bow to every Vietnamese guards, officers, and people.

1185
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Number nine, criminals must not bring anything into room from outside. Number ten, criminals must not communicate with or look at other criminals in any other room or outside.

1186
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000
With minor variations, these were the rules for the next six years.

1187
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Big one was the communication. They didn't want you guys talking to each other.

1188
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
They didn't, and they did all that they possibly could do to keep us from communicating.

1189
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
But we got very clever.

1190
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And we had a lot of ways to communicate.

1191
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Now, you spend some time in solitary confinement.

1192
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And here we go back to book.

1193
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
During this period of solitary confinement, I had much time to think.

1194
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
From the start, I established a definite schedule for personal reflection and a praisele.

1195
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
This included a two-hour worship service in the morning into similar one in the evening.

1196
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I spent much time praying talking informally with God and recalling as many scriptures, verses, and Bible stories as I could.

1197
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I also revived the words and tunes to songs from a Tennessee Ernie Ford album that I'd enjoyed on the Kitty Hawk.

1198
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Once in a while, I would start humming too loudly and a guard would bang his rifle against the door. I spent more and more time thinking about intangibles.

1199
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:55.000
The purpose for living, ethics, the supernatural, faith, pride, because the tangibles, which I had identified with,

1200
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
would no longer present.

1201
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
My aircraft, my ship, my personal possessions.

1202
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:14.000
This was the onset of a thorough re-examination of my life, often these intricate thought processes ended in slumber.

1203
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:24.000
One of the interesting things that are really most difficult to understand is how we had nothing going on.

1204
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:35.000
The average American has hundreds of thousands of inputs every day, cars and sounds and smells and touch and all these things.

1205
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:43.000
When you're in a little prison cell, especially if you're in solitary confinement, you might hear a bird.

1206
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.000
That's delightful. That's a big deal. You don't hear a bird.

1207
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.000
The good news and the bad news is your mind goes internal.

1208
01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000
You have to create things on your own.

1209
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:11.000
You think about these intangible things and you go back through your life and you think about the things that sustain life and why we are here.

1210
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Because there's nothing else to do. Did you put some kind of structure around your thoughts?

1211
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000
It seems like people might have a tendency just to let their mind wander and maybe it wanders into places they don't want it to wander into.

1212
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
No, there was a lot of structure to it.

1213
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And in fact, one of the things I did was to go back through my life to the very first memory that I ever had at three years old in Lee Compton, Kansas,

1214
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000
when my grandmother came through and wanted everybody to go with her.

1215
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I remember that date and then I went from that to the day that I was shot down.

1216
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:58.000
And tried to remember every book I ever read, every friend, every girl I ever dated, every teacher, books, movies, experiences.

1217
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And it took me about, as I recall, maybe three months working pretty hard on that total autobiography in my mind.

1218
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And after that, then I would continue to go back through those individual days and try to remember something else.

1219
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
You know, a different color that I'd forgotten, or a different person that was in the room.

1220
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And whenever I would, when I would discover something that I hadn't discovered the first three months, it was like it was like meeting an old friend.

1221
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I could think about that one person or that one book or whatever, you know, for an entire day.

1222
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And so it was just, it was a way of of of of using that time and making the time go by by working in our minds.

1223
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Did you somehow catalog the days in your mind?

1224
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Oh yeah, yeah, it was a, it was a chronology.

1225
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
It was, and most, everybody did that.

1226
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And a lot of guys did it much better than I. They could tell you, you know, what was going on this day last year, the year before and the year before.

1227
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
They, you know, they, they could remember everything.

1228
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And it had, had it all packed away. But yes, it was very well categorized.

1229
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:31.000
So you finally get some, pair pants, a couple pairs of pants, a couple shirts, some underwear under shirt, toothbrush and some soap.

1230
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And you are going to use it for the first time. I stripped and with my little drinking cup, douse myself with water, lathered with my new bar of soap and rinsed, shedding a two week layer of grime and sweat.

1231
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Then I shaved using a double edge razor, which had no handle.

1232
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And last I was clean. No itch beard, no reaking body.

1233
01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I put on my new clothes and wondered what impressions I would now make on the newly captured POWs.

1234
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Dressed, in fresh hablement, I experienced a sublime physical and mental catharsis.

1235
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Even the pain of my wounds seemed to wash away with the filth. Fifteen minutes later, I was back in myself, reinspired to outlast any Vietnamese endeavor to debase me.

1236
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:30.000
The door opened. I waited for something to happen. And then, in the doorway, centered in a tall man, back-hunged and forehead deeply lined.

1237
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:43.000
He studied me with uncertain eyes and American, another American. I rushed to the doors quickly as I could and grasped his hand, the hand which was completely numb from inadequate circulation at the elbows.

1238
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Hi, I said. I'm Charlie Poem.

1239
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
So now you're linked up with another American.

1240
01:24:50.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I am. K Russell was shot down the same day I was. And so he and I were, he was my first roommate. And, you know, I was in the same cell with a lot of different guys.

1241
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And they moved us around a lot. About every six months, it moves around. But they would give us different roommates every few months.

1242
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Or take them all away and that was in solitary confinement again. And we never really knew why. But we assumed that it was tried to destroy any fraternization with the guards and try to disrupt any unity within the prisoners.

1243
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:45.000
And so, so that, in fact, sometimes there's a little bit difficult to describe exactly what it was like because we were in different camps and different cells and you were different guys for the entire six years.

1244
01:25:45.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And you, you, you, you like it when you got a new roommate because it's like, and you, you kind of explain it's like, now you have a bunch of stuff to talk about with this person. Absolutely. Absolutely. It was, it was glorious, you know, to find because, you know, he, of course, had all of the stories and he had the movies that he could tell you about and the things that he had learned and that he could teach you. So, yeah, no, it was, it was wonderful.

1245
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:20.000
That would last for maybe a few months until you're in other things and then it became almost like a marriage, you know, where you've got those periods of time money moved periods over. Well, exactly.

1246
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Well, the fact of matter is you couldn't, in some of those cells, you couldn't be more than eight or ten feet away from a guy 24, seven for months and months and months at a time.

1247
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And so, little things start to bug you, you know, and not the least of which was, was our toilet, you know, the toilet was a two gallon bucket in the corner.

1248
01:26:46.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And lots of times it was rusted out of the top with no lid and it was just quite a, you know, it's stunk to high heaven and a lot of the cases. And it was quite an irritant.

1249
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Yeah, you guys established a routine once you got in there and you know, there's a whole chapter in the book called routine and you're waking up at six thirty in the morning. You're doing prayer at that time.

1250
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And you're at seven o'clock, you're practicing piano, which I like, right, you're practicing piano, and that was just from memory. You had you ever played piano before? I had, I had not. Now what I did know was that my span from my pinky to my thumb was not, I was, I could span nine notes on a piano.

1251
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And I played out a keyboard on my board bed and the new where the black keys were and I had played in the band and also played guitar. So I knew a little bit about chords and scales and that kind of thing. And I thought, well, I've always wanted to play the piano, you know, now's my chance.

1252
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
This piece of wood looks good to me. Yes, this is this is a work.

1253
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And at eight o'clock, you're doing pushups. Yep. And sit up some leg lifts and whatever else. So you're doing some some physical training and then you have school, the school bell rings at nine thirty a.m. And you guys are learning and teaching each other, whatever you can possibly teach each other.

1254
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Whatever subject you were good at, you were going to teach. We did. And it was serious stuff. As a matter of fact, when we got home, University of Maryland gave us credit for what we had, you know, the courses we had taught, you know, without books or paper, PowerPoints or instructors or professors or anybody.

1255
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Because we were so intent on using that time for something of value. And in these guys, most of them smarter than I would go back through their minds and recapture all of the subjects that they had learned.

1256
01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:09.000
One of the guys, Joe Milligan, I was with him, I don't know, the first few months, I guess. And he taught, of course, on a chemistry. No no biology was biology.

1257
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And I've never taken a course in biology. And I was very interested. And his course lasted about a week. And that's all he knew. But Joe, and I'll leave with him for a while would lay back on his rack about an hour a day and just think.

1258
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:40.000
About biology. And after being there for six years, his course lasted six months. And you know, everything from protozoas to medzoas. And all of this just because that was back there in his mind.

1259
01:29:40.000 --> 01:30:03.000
He was able to recall that. He could recall that. And it is amazing. What's back in there in your human brain. And we found that out. If you think about something long enough and hard enough. And again, you don't have these distractions of everyday life that there's it is awful lot stored back in there.

1260
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I had to bring this one up to it because you talked about how you didn't have PowerPoint or whatever you never pens and chalkboards. And here you go.

1261
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Often in my dreams, I must admit, I envisioned leaving the noise help him going home looking for and finding a brand new yellow pencil and bringing it back to myself.

1262
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Or I would dream of entering shops containing nothing but rose and rose of pencils. I've never since taken a pencil for granted.

1263
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:53.000
That's, you know, we take so much for granted. I mean, take so much for granted. And to think about that right there. And what what power of pencil gives you the power to take notes, the power to create the power to draw the power to write this incredible power comes from this little thing that we just gaff off like it's meaningless.

1264
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And for you to have that much appreciation for it, that you would dream about it at night.

1265
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:06.000
True. It's incredible. Ten o'clock, you eat. And what was the food?

1266
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Your food rice balls?

1267
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Yeah, mostly rice. That was the main state. You get a small bowl of rice twice a day. Once about ten o'clock, once about two o'clock in the afternoon.

1268
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And then you had a 20 hour stretch with that and to eat. Sometimes they'd give you a bowl of broth. And sometimes it would be some kind of vegetable turnups or weeds of some kind. One recall sewer soup.

1269
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
You couldn't identify this stuff.

1270
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:50.000
But I didn't need, you know, there was not enough meat to put in a coffee cup for a year. You know, there really was no meat of any variety.

1271
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
How much, how much did you weigh when you got out?

1272
01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I waited about 140 when it came home, but they fattened this up before we came home. And I figured most of the time I was there about 115 pounds.

1273
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Did you ever, was the hunger, did the hunger go away? Did you, or you just grinding hunger or did you just get used to it?

1274
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
It went away from the most part, you know, after, I don't know, four or five months.

1275
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Your stomach sort of shrinks. And when you know that there's nothing else to eat.

1276
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And so, you know, that they, in all fairness, they gave us enough to keep us alive. And so that, you know, and rice is a pretty perfect food.

1277
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:48.000
This is unpolished rice. It wasn't the Uncle Benz that we have today. And there's a lot, there's protein in there and there's nutrients in the rice.

1278
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
So that can be live.

1279
01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:04.000
At dusk, you guys would have, show time. And people would do what you're talking about describing everything and every movie they've ever seen, every book they've ever read and all that.

1280
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And you mentioned in here that in the beginning of confinement, the movies that would get described or created because people are creating movies too, right in their head.

1281
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Yes.

1282
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yes.

1283
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And they went from PG to triple X over time.

1284
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:32.000
So, did anybody come out and execute on some of these ideas that they had? Is there anybody that came out and said, yeah, I've thought of this movie or his book?

1285
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Oh, yeah.

1286
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Yeah.

1287
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
In fact, Sarah, guys, had great plans.

1288
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:45.000
When, when guy was a farmer and he had planned a pig farm. That was, that was his whole thing.

1289
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And he did, he came back and I live with guy by the name of Danny Glenn, who was an architect or student at the University of Oklahoma.

1290
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And Danny and I were together for a lot of years.

1291
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And he dreamed about building this home.

1292
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And that's only a thought about was building this dream house.

1293
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
And he had several little things about this home that were very peculiar.

1294
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:24.000
One of them was that as the sunlight would come through the top of the wall around our prison, the wall was kept with barbed wire in electrical wire and broken glass.

1295
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
The glass was from bottles of various colors.

1296
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And in one particular cell that then and I ran, the sun would come through the glass, the colored glass, and onto this tank of water.

1297
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And then reflect up under the eaves of our fats drift into our cell.

1298
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So that all these colors and it was a beautiful thing, you know, was a kaleidoscope of colors.

1299
01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And so he designed a house and he figured this whole thing out, you know, with the, with the asthma of the sun and in all the stuff and I was going to do this.

1300
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:08.000
But and he would lay this out and he would draw on the concrete floor with a piece of brick.

1301
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And it was a great artist, you know, the guy could, could design all this stuff.

1302
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And of course, he wanted me to be involved in this and, in Boramida tears.

1303
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Charlie, what color do you think about bathroom ought to be?

1304
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I don't know it.

1305
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.000
No, no, no Charlie green or blue. I don't know green.

1306
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Okay, so we, we get home in about a year after we, I was living in Kansas and he was in Oklahoma and he called me up.

1307
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Charlie, I got something to show you.

1308
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And so I had a little airplane at the time and I flew down to Norman Oklahoma and he picked me up at the airport and we drove outside of town from about a quarter mile away.

1309
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I saw this house that I recognized, but it never been a Norman Oklahoma.

1310
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And I, I swear, I could have walked in that house and touched any faucet or any light switch.

1311
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
You know, the whole place because it was exactly as he had decided the prison.

1312
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
So I went to the bathroom and it was blue.

1313
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.000
He had gone back, you know, he had built it from building materials that he had remembered and over the years of the time.

1314
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Over the years that we were there, they changed.

1315
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And so there were some of, there was not available.

1316
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:36.000
And so he went to these old lumber yards and he would find the building materials that he had planned this house with and use those to build this house.

1317
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
But it was incredible.

1318
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000
But yeah, a lot of the guys, a lot of the guys wanted to sail around the world.

1319
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.000
You know, a lot of us Navy guys and we had to sail and that was the big fantasy was to take a sailing trip around the world.

1320
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And two or three of the guys actually did that when they came home.

1321
01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Awesome. The guards, some of the guards were pretty sadistic.

1322
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And here we go back to the problem.

1323
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
The most sadistic practice of all was a game involving mice or puppies.

1324
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Guards would gouse them with gasoline and set them on fire and turn them loose to squeal and scurry and search of relief from the heat.

1325
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And the soldiers would chase them with sticks playing polo with their live fireballs until the little animals blackened and died.

1326
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So you had some serious sados.

1327
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Yeah, just doing evil things.

1328
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And you say you didn't see anything.

1329
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Book magazine, newspaper, lyrics of song, written speech, any billboard or anything while you were there that wasn't just 100% propaganda.

1330
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:51.000
That's true. There a music doesn't talk about love except for love of Ho Chi Minh and love of their country and dedication to that.

1331
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000
It's really incredible how they just fill the minds of their people with this propaganda.

1332
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
And you tell somebody long enough and loud enough and they believe it.

1333
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And that was the whole country.

1334
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:15.000
At one point, you got this propaganda newspaper and it's the front page headline was that there's been a revolution in rice planting technique.

1335
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And you were thinking yourself, oh man, they must have invented some big machine that can like plan all the rice and now they don't have to be out there.

1336
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And on doing the manual labor in the fields and here's the actual article.

1337
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
For 4,000 years, the Vietnamese people have been laboring, sweating and toiling in the mud and water of rice patties.

1338
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:37.000
We've discovered a revolutionary method of planting rice through extensive research. We have found that.

1339
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Instead of grasping the rice sprouts and planting them with the palm of the hand facing downward is much more efficient to plant the rice sprouts with the palm of the hand facing upward.

1340
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.000
So there's the propaganda coming at you.

1341
01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:00.000
And there's the advancement of the, you know, them trying to tell the people how we're moving forward in the world.

1342
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And that was another thing that surprised me or it didn't surprise me, but how what they're understanding, you know, they're brainwashed and they're understanding of what American culture was like.

1343
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And when you say, well, yeah, I have a car.

1344
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:22.000
And I have an air conditioner to them that was unbelievable because the only people that could afford that in Vietnam were the state itself.

1345
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000
True. And they assumed that if you had a car, you could carry pigs or chickens or something in your car.

1346
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I guess that was the whole purpose of any kind of transportation. It was the whole something around.

1347
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And they, you know, they were really surprised that you could actually just get in the car and go where everyone to go.

1348
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000
And they also thought that a third of Americans were starving to death.

1349
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:57.000
So that's, you know, something to think about always when you deal with these countries where people are being indoctrinated and be whether being fed information from the state.

1350
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
It's going to be, it's going to be lies.

1351
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And you can't be surprised when they believe something like that. You just have to say, you don't even believe how do we re-educate them.

1352
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I went back to Vietnam.

1353
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And the first time in 43 years I had been back. And a lot of things had changed. You know, I mean, they still call themselves a communist country, but by the way, capitalism is alive and well.

1354
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
But the propaganda still exists there.

1355
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And, and they'll, they'll, I took my family with me. My wife and three of our four kids.

1356
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And in the 11 days that I was there, I never met anyone. And I was, you know, as to embassy. I spoke to the students at the university.

1357
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I spoke to cab drivers and waitresses and anybody. And they really, really nice people and very, very nice to me.

1358
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.000
But nobody knew that Americans had been tortured in the Vietnam War.

1359
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And in fact, it was just the opposite. They all would tell you that we got better treatment than the soldiers did.

1360
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And better medical care than the soldiers did. And so, and in fact, and in one of the, and one of the last days I was there, I ran into a lady in a park selling card postcards.

1361
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:28.000
And she was missing one leg. And she was about my age. And so I sort of piece this thing together. And she said, one by postcard.

1362
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Well, I'll buy a postcard, but I went to hear your story sitting down on this park bench and tell me your story.

1363
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And she did. I said, how do you lose your leg? She said, linebacker 2.

1364
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Linebacker 2 was the codename for the B-52 bombings that ended the war in the Christmas of 1972.

1365
01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:00.000
But it was a secret codename, you know? And for her to say, it was, the shoots she didn't call an air raid or a bomb or anything else. She's called a linebacker 2.

1366
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000
That was hard. You know, that was a pilot jargon, not her jargon.

1367
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And I said, what, what, what was the date? She said 24 December 1972. So I knew that she wasn't lying to me.

1368
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:24.000
She said, be 52. Oh yeah. Well, so we talked for maybe 30 minutes on that park bench.

1369
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And she spoke very good English. And at one point I said to her, you speak excellent English. You could be an interpreter.

1370
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
You could be a guide. Why are you out here making a living selling postcards in the park?

1371
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:46.000
She said, oh my, my country would never give me a permit because I've been invalid.

1372
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Man, what a country. And then I said, well, do you know about the museums? Oh yeah, I know all about the museums and the handle of the museum.

1373
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
See, they've made a museum out of my old prison camp. The handle of the Hennoy Hilton is now a museum.

1374
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:12.000
And I said, well, how are the prisoners treated at the museum? Oh, they were treated great. They had great food.

1375
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:19.000
They played volleyball. They had ping-plong. I said, how do you know this? She said, oh documentaries.

1376
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The government shows us documentaries. And so she finally figured out that I was about her age and she said, were you a pilot?

1377
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I said, yeah, I was a pilot. She said, be 52. I said, no, I flew at four phantoms. Oh, so were you flying on the 24th of December?

1378
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:50.000
1972? I said, no, I was right here with you. I was in the Hennoy Hilton and I was being tortured. She said, no, that's impossible.

1379
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:59.000
That can't possibly be true. I could not convince this lady that I would, that I'd be, or anybody else.

1380
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:09.000
So the propaganda is alive and well. They continue to tell that people the lies and the folks have no way of figuring it out.

1381
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:22.000
You know, it's another thing that you point out in the book on that culture or that system of government back to the book, the Vietnamese rarely exerted themselves. Why should they?

1382
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:32.000
If they were going to get a meal at all, they'd eat regardless of whether they worked for it or not. They didn't worry. They didn't have to. The state was responsible for their welfare as well as their guidance.

1383
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Even the upkeep of state property was not their problem. So there's a scary thing when it really is. When folks are indoctrinated to that level.

1384
01:44:46.000 --> 01:45:01.000
But it's so prevalent. And they tried to do the same thing with us. They tried to brainwash us. And it was more important. You were kind of worried about that too in the beginning, right? Like you thought it was something you needed to be concerned about.

1385
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And then you saw the ridiculous all this.

1386
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And they used a lot of the Russian military equipment, but they never invited the Russians into try to brainwash us. And we felt very, very happy about that because their brainwashing techniques were so silly.

1387
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And they would tell us this unbelievable things that we laughed at.

1388
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But you thought the Russians would do a better job. Oh, yeah. I'm sure they would have. But more important than the rice we ate or the water we drank and every prison cell I was in, the first thing they put in there was a speaker.

1389
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And you know, lots of the prison camps didn't have any electricity at all, but they had speakers. And they were put well above our reach so we couldn't turn them off or adjust the volume.

1390
01:45:49.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And several times a day they would come on with propaganda and telling us how bad we were and how terrible our country was. Now wonderful they were.

1391
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:16.000
And it was pretty easy to turn these guys off, you know, just to ignore the broadcast. But it was also very concerning, you know, to see that that's the way they,

1392
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:31.000
So any of the indoctrinated people horrible. You talked about a little bit earlier. You talked about the communication and and what that was all about. And you had this lift the first time you were in yourself.

1393
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:47.000
You hear a little scraping and eventually you go over and it's a little wire and eventually note comes through it and here we go back to the book. It had a piece of toilet paper tied to it. I unfolded it and found these words memorize code eat note.

1394
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Code was easier to memorize than the note was to eat by did both. I reject the door sat back down on the honey bucket and talked on the wire. The code was a series of talks which represented letters the alphabet.

1395
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And it's basically a five by five code ABCDG EFG and that is how you guys communicated.

1396
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And that had to be how long does it take to have a conversation with that code because you give you know one two talks to go down and then one two three talks to go across how long to take with you these conversations must have taken long died.

1397
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Well, that's true, but that was a beauty of it because that's all we had was time.

1398
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:45.000
And that was a very good way of of while in a way the hours is tugging on the wires tapping on walls and or or sneezing and wheezing it we had all kinds of ways to communicate and we took great pride in our communication effort.

1399
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And the sneezing and the reason that just was it more is how do the sneezing and wheezing work is often it was the same kind of thing you know it was all based around this five by five matrix of the alphabet.

1400
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:10.000
And so a cough would wouldn't be one a sneeze would be two a weas would be three on and so forth so that so that two sounds would equal a letter.

1401
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:26.000
And we use this in a lot of different ways if a guy was outside chopping wood for a fire for instance, and he would chop in this code chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped chopped and it was when we called it a radio station.

1402
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.20
video station because everybody could hear it.

1403
01:48:29.20 --> 01:48:37.80
And so if a new guy came into the camp and we knew who the president was,

1404
01:48:37.80 --> 01:48:43.36
you know, lots of, we had no information at all or knew who on the world's series,

1405
01:48:43.36 --> 01:48:47.20
for instance, why that was really big deal, you know, to get out there and

1406
01:48:47.20 --> 01:48:52.80
and chop the wood in the radio station and tell the entire camp who was the president.

1407
01:48:52.80 --> 01:48:59.000
Did the guards ever catch onto that five by five code?

1408
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.80
Yes, occasionally a couple of guys were tortured to reveal the code, but they were,

1409
01:49:05.80 --> 01:49:13.16
it was really interesting because they were so uncordinated that they couldn't replicate

1410
01:49:13.16 --> 01:49:18.60
the code and they, on several cases, they tried to trick us and they would empty out

1411
01:49:18.60 --> 01:49:24.84
a cell and they would go into that cell and try to tap on the wall or tug on the wire

1412
01:49:24.84 --> 01:49:25.84
in the code.

1413
01:49:25.84 --> 01:49:31.08
And we knew immediately, you know, that it wasn't an American.

1414
01:49:31.08 --> 01:49:36.28
And you guys would get, like I said, it's interesting you count, you laid out two things

1415
01:49:36.28 --> 01:49:40.84
that first the Vietnamese were like pretty much okay with stealing and so you wouldn't

1416
01:49:40.84 --> 01:49:44.44
get punished for stealing that bad, but the communication thing is what they, is what

1417
01:49:44.44 --> 01:49:45.44
they would definitely punish you.

1418
01:49:45.44 --> 01:49:49.56
Yeah, true.

1419
01:49:49.56 --> 01:49:51.04
I mean, that's the same thing.

1420
01:49:51.04 --> 01:49:54.64
I mean, when we capture prisoners overseas, we don't want to talk to each other, we separate

1421
01:49:54.64 --> 01:49:57.88
them and you don't want to talk to each other.

1422
01:49:57.88 --> 01:50:04.32
And at some point you started getting letters and receiving letters and how did that change

1423
01:50:04.32 --> 01:50:06.32
the environment?

1424
01:50:06.32 --> 01:50:12.92
Well, in the first of all, we were just overjoyed to see that our families, you know, that

1425
01:50:12.92 --> 01:50:16.16
my wife was okay.

1426
01:50:16.16 --> 01:50:21.000
And that they knew that we were alive.

1427
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.96
And so it was a wonderful connection that we made.

1428
01:50:24.96 --> 01:50:36.36
Now, we call them letters, but actually they were postcards and they were highly edited.

1429
01:50:36.36 --> 01:50:39.92
It began with the postcards where just blanked out.

1430
01:50:39.92 --> 01:50:44.56
And then the Vietnamese decided that that's not good enough, they actually would cut out

1431
01:50:44.56 --> 01:50:46.20
certain words.

1432
01:50:46.20 --> 01:50:52.56
And so you get a postcard, I'm six lines, and maybe of the six lines there might be

1433
01:50:52.56 --> 01:50:56.84
15 words that were just cut out with a pair of scissors.

1434
01:50:56.84 --> 01:51:01.64
So that sometimes you really couldn't figure it out what they were trying to say.

1435
01:51:01.64 --> 01:51:09.72
But, you know, that the fact that that was in the handwriting of a loved one was, was

1436
01:51:09.72 --> 01:51:11.36
very comforting.

1437
01:51:11.36 --> 01:51:17.48
And yet those bastards, and I use that term very specifically for this situation, the

1438
01:51:17.48 --> 01:51:21.76
deer John letters, they leave those completely good to go and turn those over.

1439
01:51:21.76 --> 01:51:25.64
Yeah, you know, I can say bastards for that kind of behavior.

1440
01:51:25.64 --> 01:51:26.64
For bastards.

1441
01:51:26.64 --> 01:51:33.72
Yeah, they were quick to tell us that our wives had filed for divorce or that, you know, our

1442
01:51:33.72 --> 01:51:38.04
parents had died or that any bad news.

1443
01:51:38.04 --> 01:51:40.88
They were very quick to promote.

1444
01:51:40.88 --> 01:51:43.28
Yeah.

1445
01:51:43.28 --> 01:51:49.16
The chain of command that you guys, you know, hear you are in this prison camp and you guys

1446
01:51:49.16 --> 01:51:53.12
all, you know, you figured out, you realize we need to have a chain of command, and you

1447
01:51:53.12 --> 01:51:55.84
put that structure into place.

1448
01:51:55.84 --> 01:52:04.16
And when you did that, it seems like it would have, it seems like that gave you guys

1449
01:52:04.16 --> 01:52:11.20
so much strength as a group to get in the chain of command to organize yourselves.

1450
01:52:11.20 --> 01:52:17.76
It seemed like that gave you guys so much strength and fortitude as you were there.

1451
01:52:17.76 --> 01:52:21.16
It was absolutely our survival.

1452
01:52:21.16 --> 01:52:24.68
Was our chain of command.

1453
01:52:24.68 --> 01:52:28.60
What you don't know and reading my book, because they only happened two or three years ago,

1454
01:52:28.60 --> 01:52:33.72
a study was done of all the combatants of Vietnam, of all the million and a half people

1455
01:52:33.72 --> 01:52:39.000
that were exposed to that war, 30.6% had PTSD.

1456
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.36
Almost a third of the combatants in Vietnam, post-traumatic stress disorder, of the prisoners

1457
01:52:43.36 --> 01:52:48.04
of war, 4% of us had PTSD.

1458
01:52:48.04 --> 01:52:52.56
And it's primarily the guys who were shot down near the end of the war, we're only prisoners

1459
01:52:52.56 --> 01:52:55.80
for a few weeks or a month or two.

1460
01:52:55.80 --> 01:53:02.04
And what we really believe, this is spelled out in another book called Lessons from the Hanway

1461
01:53:02.04 --> 01:53:06.80
Hillton, which was written about two years ago.

1462
01:53:06.80 --> 01:53:11.52
Lessons from the Hanway Hillton explains that the reason why we came back and are in such

1463
01:53:11.52 --> 01:53:18.72
great shape is because of the unit that we had in the leadership that we had in the prison

1464
01:53:18.72 --> 01:53:26.04
camps, because of the 591 guys came home and of the 590, and they thought would be in baskets.

1465
01:53:26.04 --> 01:53:27.80
They would be vegetables.

1466
01:53:27.80 --> 01:53:32.36
They had our families briefed to institutionalize us for the rest of our lives.

1467
01:53:32.36 --> 01:53:35.84
That's what they thought was coming home and what can you expect.

1468
01:53:35.84 --> 01:53:41.32
From 591 guys, we've produced 17 generals, 7 admirals.

1469
01:53:41.32 --> 01:53:44.72
Most of us retired as senior grade military officers.

1470
01:53:44.72 --> 01:53:48.32
We have doctors and lawyers and preachers and teachers and bishops and judges.

1471
01:53:48.32 --> 01:53:54.16
We have a bunch of congressmen, two United States senators, two ambassadors.

1472
01:53:54.16 --> 01:53:58.32
We have a vice president to candidate, a president to candidate, my old flight instructor

1473
01:53:58.32 --> 01:53:59.88
John McCain.

1474
01:53:59.88 --> 01:54:05.08
And they're telling this today where it healthier, mentally and physically, then if we hadn't

1475
01:54:05.08 --> 01:54:06.64
been shot down.

1476
01:54:06.64 --> 01:54:12.96
And it was primarily because of the leadership, the chain of command that we had over there,

1477
01:54:12.96 --> 01:54:16.96
the unity that we found and the purpose.

1478
01:54:16.96 --> 01:54:22.32
That's what the leadership in the prison camp did for us.

1479
01:54:22.32 --> 01:54:27.84
Jim Stockdale was our senior, as our senior residing officer in the prison camp for a long

1480
01:54:27.84 --> 01:54:29.08
time.

1481
01:54:29.08 --> 01:54:34.84
And he said, we are no longer victims of circumstances beyond our control.

1482
01:54:34.84 --> 01:54:37.68
We are not on the defensive here.

1483
01:54:37.68 --> 01:54:39.36
We are military men.

1484
01:54:39.36 --> 01:54:40.36
We are combatants.

1485
01:54:40.36 --> 01:54:44.44
And we will pursue this war until our last breath.

1486
01:54:44.44 --> 01:54:52.28
And so what that did was it gave us a reason to live, a reason to be a reason to unify.

1487
01:54:52.28 --> 01:54:59.68
And the way we fought the war from the prison camp was to try to deny them any propaganda.

1488
01:54:59.68 --> 01:55:05.04
Because as you've already said, John, that propaganda was the mainstay.

1489
01:55:05.04 --> 01:55:12.48
I mean, that was the numeral Uno in their world was propaganda.

1490
01:55:12.48 --> 01:55:19.76
And they felt that they could use us to tell the rest of the world how wonderful communism

1491
01:55:19.76 --> 01:55:20.76
was.

1492
01:55:20.76 --> 01:55:24.44
And now they were right and we were wrong.

1493
01:55:24.44 --> 01:55:31.74
And so they would force guys to make tapes or write letters to the anti-war element and

1494
01:55:31.74 --> 01:55:37.08
proclaim the wonderful nature of communism.

1495
01:55:37.08 --> 01:55:41.68
And so our job was to defend against this.

1496
01:55:41.68 --> 01:55:50.44
And so we set up all kinds of methods so that we would deny them any propaganda.

1497
01:55:50.44 --> 01:55:55.56
Or even in some cases, we would even go farther than the other propaganda.

1498
01:55:55.56 --> 01:55:59.08
We would use their tools against them.

1499
01:55:59.08 --> 01:56:02.04
And that we would tell the world that all by the way, we are being tortured.

1500
01:56:02.04 --> 01:56:07.96
And all by the way, you know, these guys are attacking our neighbor in South Vietnam.

1501
01:56:07.96 --> 01:56:11.72
And so that was the big effort.

1502
01:56:11.72 --> 01:56:17.92
And you know, like I said, this whole thing just came out a few years ago that this

1503
01:56:17.92 --> 01:56:25.68
was the big reason that we did so well and that we're so healthy mentally and physically

1504
01:56:25.68 --> 01:56:29.44
today was because we had this chain of command.

1505
01:56:29.44 --> 01:56:34.48
And on top of that, and this is what I've really wanted a big point I wanted to talk

1506
01:56:34.48 --> 01:56:39.08
about today was what you're just hitting on is that people have this idea that the military

1507
01:56:39.08 --> 01:56:42.08
chain of command is this rigid structure.

1508
01:56:42.08 --> 01:56:43.48
And that's why it survives.

1509
01:56:43.48 --> 01:56:49.68
And that's what you guys were put into a position that it was yesterday's military chain

1510
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:50.68
of command.

1511
01:56:50.68 --> 01:56:51.68
Just like I had in the civil teams.

1512
01:56:51.68 --> 01:56:54.36
And if you think in the civil teams that I was, God, that was in charge.

1513
01:56:54.36 --> 01:56:56.72
And I was barking the orders and everyone was following everything I said to us.

1514
01:56:56.72 --> 01:56:58.28
It was like, no, it wasn't like that.

1515
01:56:58.28 --> 01:57:01.60
It's a much more collaborative deal.

1516
01:57:01.60 --> 01:57:06.04
And this really became clear one section of the book here.

1517
01:57:06.04 --> 01:57:12.20
I'm going to read that what you were dealing with and how challenging this leadership position

1518
01:57:12.20 --> 01:57:14.80
was for the people that were leading.

1519
01:57:14.80 --> 01:57:19.76
So here we're going back to the book making sure that everyone was on our team was the

1520
01:57:19.76 --> 01:57:22.04
first of many objectives.

1521
01:57:22.04 --> 01:57:24.68
Understanding the rules of the game was the second.

1522
01:57:24.68 --> 01:57:28.52
It was assumed that all of us had a basic knowledge of the military discipline and the

1523
01:57:28.52 --> 01:57:30.44
code of conduct.

1524
01:57:30.44 --> 01:57:35.72
This code, a very general document, was open to many interpretations.

1525
01:57:35.72 --> 01:57:40.36
How we can shoot the code often dependent on severity of the situation.

1526
01:57:40.36 --> 01:57:45.24
No longer could we pick up a telephone and call the Pentagon for advice.

1527
01:57:45.24 --> 01:57:50.36
The broad spectrum of the code divided the men into at least two groups.

1528
01:57:50.36 --> 01:57:55.92
Those who were disciplinarians by nature and interpreted the code strictly and those who

1529
01:57:55.92 --> 01:57:58.84
were liberal and rendered the code loosely.

1530
01:57:58.84 --> 01:58:03.08
We called these two groups the tough guys and the softies.

1531
01:58:03.08 --> 01:58:05.48
But this is the key part right here.

1532
01:58:05.48 --> 01:58:08.16
Softy was not derogatory.

1533
01:58:08.16 --> 01:58:11.60
The name simply indicated a different approach to the code.

1534
01:58:11.60 --> 01:58:16.60
Tough guys who referred to the line I will never surrender of my own free will sometimes

1535
01:58:16.60 --> 01:58:20.28
flaunted their incuragibility and taunted the guards.

1536
01:58:20.28 --> 01:58:25.60
The Vietnamese answered with torture and the tough guys occasionally relinquished more information

1537
01:58:25.60 --> 01:58:29.16
than the softies who never committed themselves.

1538
01:58:29.16 --> 01:58:33.04
Regardless of our attitudes, we were all in the same boat.

1539
01:58:33.04 --> 01:58:38.28
Each of us had acquiesced the Vietnamese controlled to some extent, whether accepting cigarettes

1540
01:58:38.28 --> 01:58:40.08
or bowing to guards.

1541
01:58:40.08 --> 01:58:45.28
The line which separated the tough guys from the softies was often unclear.

1542
01:58:45.28 --> 01:58:48.80
The important thing was to display unity.

1543
01:58:48.80 --> 01:58:55.48
Regardless of our individual philosophies, we clearly understood that the Vietnamese would capitalize

1544
01:58:55.48 --> 01:58:58.84
on any chinks they found in our armor.

1545
01:58:58.84 --> 01:59:04.44
Unity didn't evolve automatically, learning its value required from us such introspection

1546
01:59:04.44 --> 01:59:06.36
and sacrifice.

1547
01:59:06.36 --> 01:59:12.96
How could a camp SRO appease the softies if he interpreted the code too strictly?

1548
01:59:12.96 --> 01:59:15.80
Or if he was too lacks for the tough guys?

1549
01:59:15.80 --> 01:59:20.72
He was in an untenable position, having little control over the actions of men and other

1550
01:59:20.72 --> 01:59:21.88
rooms.

1551
01:59:21.88 --> 01:59:27.72
He had excessive responsibility, but none of the tools of authority.

1552
01:59:27.72 --> 01:59:33.44
The reduction of salary, suspension of liberty, court martial, indeed most of the fellows

1553
01:59:33.44 --> 01:59:35.28
he had never seen.

1554
01:59:35.28 --> 01:59:40.20
His only association being a tap on the wall or a scribbled message.

1555
01:59:40.20 --> 01:59:46.40
To meet this impractical setting, the SRO wielded gentlesticks of diplomacy.

1556
01:59:46.40 --> 01:59:52.48
They knew we were not boots, meaning boot camp, guys fresh out of boot camp, who asked

1557
01:59:52.48 --> 01:59:54.92
how high at the command to jump.

1558
01:59:54.92 --> 01:59:58.84
We were all trained leaders who acted independently.

1559
01:59:58.84 --> 02:00:04.40
For the first few years, the SRO's authority was limited to advice rather than orders.

1560
02:00:04.40 --> 02:00:11.24
Realizing the importance of unity, we respected his advice as the went or an order.

1561
02:00:11.24 --> 02:00:14.36
What if we refused an order on the basis that it did not come from the commander, but

1562
02:00:14.36 --> 02:00:18.56
rather from five men who interpreted through an error-ridden system?

1563
02:00:18.56 --> 02:00:22.88
What if compliance to the order brought certain torture?

1564
02:00:22.88 --> 02:00:25.76
We were very alone in answering these questions.

1565
02:00:25.76 --> 02:00:32.76
Once I received an order, plum, request you communicate with Captain Abbott at all costs.

1566
02:00:32.76 --> 02:00:35.84
What did the SRO mean by at all costs?

1567
02:00:35.84 --> 02:00:41.48
Did it include being caught and put in legions for months at a time?

1568
02:00:41.48 --> 02:00:48.48
So the way that that is laid out, it reflects not just leadership in a prison camp.

1569
02:00:48.48 --> 02:00:52.52
I'm here to tell you, it reflects leadership in every situation because the minute that

1570
02:00:52.52 --> 02:00:56.84
you is a leader, decide that you're just going to impose your well on other people is

1571
02:00:56.84 --> 02:01:01.16
where you start to lose respect and people start questioning what you're doing.

1572
02:01:01.16 --> 02:01:02.96
That's very true.

1573
02:01:02.96 --> 02:01:07.64
I think that the way that this comes out, and that probably is one of the reasons why

1574
02:01:07.64 --> 02:01:13.72
I didn't know about the facts that you just told me about the only 4% having PTSD.

1575
02:01:13.72 --> 02:01:20.72
In obviously, you rattled off all the successful POWs that came out of this horrible situation.

1576
02:01:20.72 --> 02:01:28.64
That openness that opened mind as leaders and as subordinates to say, look, I'm getting

1577
02:01:28.64 --> 02:01:30.64
this advice, right?

1578
02:01:30.64 --> 02:01:33.04
This is so called advice from the boss.

1579
02:01:33.04 --> 02:01:34.04
I respect it.

1580
02:01:34.04 --> 02:01:38.28
I'm going to act on it not because I have to, but because I understand the mission.

1581
02:01:38.28 --> 02:01:40.80
I understand why we're doing this.

1582
02:01:40.80 --> 02:01:43.72
And therefore it's not something that's being imposed on me.

1583
02:01:43.72 --> 02:01:48.40
It's something that I am accepting and pushing forward of my own accord.

1584
02:01:48.40 --> 02:01:49.40
That's a huge difference.

1585
02:01:49.40 --> 02:01:51.04
It truly is.

1586
02:01:51.04 --> 02:01:58.64
But I must admit that when I first heard about this, I was taking it back and I'm thinking,

1587
02:01:58.64 --> 02:02:00.36
you know, this is really silly.

1588
02:02:00.36 --> 02:02:05.000
I've got some senior officer down to the in-sell of the cell block and he's putting

1589
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.68
more restrictions on me than I already have.

1590
02:02:07.68 --> 02:02:10.68
What you're going to do?

1591
02:02:10.68 --> 02:02:13.28
Take away my liberty card.

1592
02:02:13.28 --> 02:02:15.28
Can I go in the brig?

1593
02:02:15.28 --> 02:02:17.28
Yes, I'm in the brig.

1594
02:02:17.28 --> 02:02:19.20
I am there.

1595
02:02:19.20 --> 02:02:27.48
And I had to be convinced that this was in our best interest.

1596
02:02:27.48 --> 02:02:29.56
But it truly was.

1597
02:02:29.56 --> 02:02:37.36
And obviously, that's the reason we came out as healthy as we did was because you say

1598
02:02:37.36 --> 02:02:43.52
better than most discipline, discipline brought about freedom.

1599
02:02:43.52 --> 02:02:47.88
And it was kind of crazy because we were being restricted even more.

1600
02:02:47.88 --> 02:02:51.56
Because of the restriction, we had unity, which gave us the freedom.

1601
02:02:51.56 --> 02:02:52.56
Yeah.

1602
02:02:52.56 --> 02:02:59.12
And then you guys started taking the broad code of conduct and specifying it because you

1603
02:02:59.12 --> 02:03:02.68
guys had so much time into these things that you called plums.

1604
02:03:02.68 --> 02:03:05.64
And you didn't really know what the establishment of the word plums came from.

1605
02:03:05.64 --> 02:03:12.20
But they were detailed tenants of how you all were going to carry yourself.

1606
02:03:12.20 --> 02:03:13.20
And you called them plums.

1607
02:03:13.20 --> 02:03:17.000
And they were things like the order that you were going to go home.

1608
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.80
You know, not eating the Vietnamese and in white Washington, the truths.

1609
02:03:21.80 --> 02:03:29.56
The resistance, how what level of resistance you were going to give when you were interrogated,

1610
02:03:29.56 --> 02:03:36.000
how much resistance you were going to give with, and Rescon 6 was just military bearing.

1611
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.64
And then Rescon 1 was straight up hunger strike.

1612
02:03:41.64 --> 02:03:44.68
That was one of the greatest displays, I think.

1613
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:51.24
That really affected the enemy was when they found out that when our commanding officer

1614
02:03:51.24 --> 02:03:57.56
of a camp could say, OK, Rescon 3, no more bowing to the enemy.

1615
02:03:57.56 --> 02:04:03.92
And so throughout the camp in these individual cells, you know, there might be 75 different

1616
02:04:03.92 --> 02:04:04.92
cells.

1617
02:04:04.92 --> 02:04:11.64
And suddenly at the stroke of one button, you know, nobody would bow to the guards.

1618
02:04:11.64 --> 02:04:16.32
And it really frightened them to know that we had that much control, that much unity.

1619
02:04:16.32 --> 02:04:18.32
And it was a silly thing.

1620
02:04:18.32 --> 02:04:25.56
But it really felt so good, you know, that we had that we had some leverage here.

1621
02:04:25.56 --> 02:04:32.52
And the other thing was that how you stayed unified was by not accepting favors.

1622
02:04:32.52 --> 02:04:34.80
And then you had to just the dichotomy leadership, right?

1623
02:04:34.80 --> 02:04:38.80
You got a balance between, hey, if I can accept a favor and it's going to help us, it's

1624
02:04:38.80 --> 02:04:39.96
going to make me healthier.

1625
02:04:39.96 --> 02:04:42.44
It's going to then I should probably do it.

1626
02:04:42.44 --> 02:04:49.84
But then they put this, then the commander, the SRO, would put a restriction or a reasonable

1627
02:04:49.84 --> 02:04:50.84
time friend.

1628
02:04:50.84 --> 02:04:55.40
So this was a classic example, because I already talked about how, how in love you were

1629
02:04:55.40 --> 02:04:56.88
with pencils at this point.

1630
02:04:56.88 --> 02:04:58.48
At some point, you got a pencil.

1631
02:04:58.48 --> 02:05:00.72
Somehow you got to, they gave you a pencil.

1632
02:05:00.72 --> 02:05:04.52
And you know, the word spread that you guys had a pencil.

1633
02:05:04.52 --> 02:05:11.56
And the report or the direction came back was, okay, you have 30 days to get more pencils.

1634
02:05:11.56 --> 02:05:12.96
So we're all equal.

1635
02:05:12.96 --> 02:05:14.76
Or you got to give the pencil back.

1636
02:05:14.76 --> 02:05:16.12
And you didn't get more pencils.

1637
02:05:16.12 --> 02:05:17.68
And you had to give that pencil back.

1638
02:05:17.68 --> 02:05:18.68
Yep.

1639
02:05:18.68 --> 02:05:21.08
That's.

1640
02:05:21.08 --> 02:05:27.36
But that you can see how, when you, how unified you are and how, just like you said, that

1641
02:05:27.36 --> 02:05:33.64
shows the, the, the guards and the camp leaders, hey, we are unified.

1642
02:05:33.64 --> 02:05:34.64
You can't break us.

1643
02:05:34.64 --> 02:05:37.88
You can't give, you can't give somebody some special help, but not give it to everyone.

1644
02:05:37.88 --> 02:05:38.88
Yep.

1645
02:05:38.88 --> 02:05:39.88
Unbelievable.

1646
02:05:39.88 --> 02:05:44.16
Now you started talking about this a little earlier.

1647
02:05:44.16 --> 02:05:48.32
And I had to do the little bit deeper on it, because I think it hits a part message, right?

1648
02:05:48.32 --> 02:05:52.56
So when you talk about living with somebody and how, when you're living with somebody, and

1649
02:05:52.56 --> 02:05:56.04
the furthest you can get away from them is eight feet.

1650
02:05:56.04 --> 02:05:59.08
Sometimes I feel like this with echo and we're, you know, we don't even live with this

1651
02:05:59.08 --> 02:06:01.72
guy, but it's sitting in this podcast being for.

1652
02:06:01.72 --> 02:06:03.60
And you start saying, okay, that's going to,

1653
02:06:03.60 --> 02:06:06.68
what, what, things start to grind on you and you rotate you.

1654
02:06:06.68 --> 02:06:10.56
So whether they were extras, like you get a guy that's going to exercise while you're trying

1655
02:06:10.56 --> 02:06:15.60
to sleep or you get a guy that's snores, which if you've ever dealt with somebody that's

1656
02:06:15.60 --> 02:06:20.20
snores, they can't help, but they don't even know that they sound like a chain saw in your

1657
02:06:20.20 --> 02:06:21.20
room.

1658
02:06:21.20 --> 02:06:25.52
And you're deal with, you might get roomed up with somebody that's snores every single night.

1659
02:06:25.52 --> 02:06:29.16
And the worst thing about somebody that's snores is when you start thinking that it bothers

1660
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:30.16
you.

1661
02:06:30.16 --> 02:06:32.16
It bothers you even for that.

1662
02:06:32.16 --> 02:06:33.16
Right?

1663
02:06:33.16 --> 02:06:34.16
That's the thing.

1664
02:06:34.16 --> 02:06:37.08
Pacing was another thing that would, you know, I'm going to just get up and pace

1665
02:06:37.08 --> 02:06:38.84
and hey man, just sit down.

1666
02:06:38.84 --> 02:06:46.76
So all these things, some POWs ate rice a grain at a time, a grain at a time.

1667
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:55.64
And, you know, like I got all these little, um, these little, I guess these little

1668
02:06:55.64 --> 02:06:57.08
ediosyncrasies, right?

1669
02:06:57.08 --> 02:07:02.92
And what you eventually said was, I'm going to take those ediosyncrasies that bothers me

1670
02:07:02.92 --> 02:07:05.76
about you and I'm going to take the blame on myself.

1671
02:07:05.76 --> 02:07:10.16
I shouldn't be bothered by this and I'm the one that can't let it bother me.

1672
02:07:10.16 --> 02:07:16.80
And that is a huge difference to what most people do, which is, hey, it's all about me.

1673
02:07:16.80 --> 02:07:19.28
And if you're bothering me, you need to change.

1674
02:07:19.28 --> 02:07:21.88
And your all's attitude was, no, you know what?

1675
02:07:21.88 --> 02:07:24.12
My attitude's, you don't need to change.

1676
02:07:24.12 --> 02:07:25.12
I need to change.

1677
02:07:25.12 --> 02:07:28.36
I need to become more accepting of the way you are.

1678
02:07:28.36 --> 02:07:29.36
That's a big deal.

1679
02:07:29.36 --> 02:07:33.72
If you can make that transition in your life, you can be much happier for us.

1680
02:07:33.72 --> 02:07:34.72
That's true.

1681
02:07:34.72 --> 02:07:37.28
And I'm still trying.

1682
02:07:37.28 --> 02:07:47.68
We all, and it's one of those things where it really is a gain changer because now,

1683
02:07:47.68 --> 02:07:49.28
you know, it's extreme ownership, right?

1684
02:07:49.28 --> 02:07:51.40
I'm not going to blame everything on you for annoying me.

1685
02:07:51.40 --> 02:07:52.92
I'm going to take it on myself.

1686
02:07:52.92 --> 02:07:55.72
And then sometimes you would, you'd have something that really like maybe you couldn't

1687
02:07:55.72 --> 02:07:59.32
sleep and now you've got to talk to somebody else and have, have an indirect conversation

1688
02:07:59.32 --> 02:08:03.56
and set a saying, hey, Echo is really bothering me, clicking his pen over there.

1689
02:08:03.56 --> 02:08:05.76
It's going to drive me crazy.

1690
02:08:05.76 --> 02:08:06.76
Can you?

1691
02:08:06.76 --> 02:08:10.36
Maybe talk to him about his pen etiquette and have him stop that.

1692
02:08:10.36 --> 02:08:15.36
He's not doing it today, sir, but there was an episode where you had the pen in his

1693
02:08:15.36 --> 02:08:17.36
hand, things got a little bit fidgety.

1694
02:08:17.36 --> 02:08:20.36
And yeah, I didn't let it bother me.

1695
02:08:20.36 --> 02:08:21.36
You know what I did?

1696
02:08:21.36 --> 02:08:23.60
Brought him a new pen that didn't have the clicker on it.

1697
02:08:23.60 --> 02:08:25.60
That took ownership of that situation.

1698
02:08:25.60 --> 02:08:26.60
Yeah.

1699
02:08:26.60 --> 02:08:29.28
You know, in today's world, we have so many people.

1700
02:08:29.28 --> 02:08:32.12
They're so offended by certain things.

1701
02:08:32.12 --> 02:08:38.68
And it's the same principle there is that if you offend me, that's really more of my

1702
02:08:38.68 --> 02:08:40.68
problem than it is your problem.

1703
02:08:40.68 --> 02:08:45.68
I'm the one that decides if you offend me.

1704
02:08:45.68 --> 02:08:49.16
So I need to change my idea of what's offensive.

1705
02:08:49.16 --> 02:08:49.16
Yeah.

1706
02:08:49.16 --> 02:08:57.52
One of the things that, you know, where it's easy to sit and laugh here a little bit about

1707
02:08:57.52 --> 02:09:02.80
some of the stuff, but one of your chapters is called insanity.

1708
02:09:02.80 --> 02:09:04.88
And I'm going to the book here.

1709
02:09:04.88 --> 02:09:08.32
The first I knew of it was in the fall of 1968.

1710
02:09:08.32 --> 02:09:10.08
And I didn't understand.

1711
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:14.60
And old beat up French ambulance, rattled into the courtyard in American wearing prison

1712
02:09:14.60 --> 02:09:16.08
guard, crawled out.

1713
02:09:16.08 --> 02:09:19.44
He weaved like a robot with head down and shoulders slumped.

1714
02:09:19.44 --> 02:09:24.08
It was odd guards never allowed POWs to walk that way.

1715
02:09:24.08 --> 02:09:25.16
We devil timed.

1716
02:09:25.16 --> 02:09:27.04
Who was this man?

1717
02:09:27.04 --> 02:09:28.72
He just come from the hospital.

1718
02:09:28.72 --> 02:09:33.84
Was he tortured in the semi-conscious or was he faking when would we find out?

1719
02:09:33.84 --> 02:09:39.08
The man was hallucinatory, insisting that his cellmates were communists, peace together

1720
02:09:39.08 --> 02:09:42.64
with limbs and heads of dead Americans.

1721
02:09:42.64 --> 02:09:44.56
Who's arm is that he asked?

1722
02:09:44.56 --> 02:09:46.72
Is that my pilot's arm?

1723
02:09:46.72 --> 02:09:49.92
How can you call me speaks such good English?

1724
02:09:49.92 --> 02:09:55.000
Because this man was wasting away was necessary for his cellmates to force feed him.

1725
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.80
The hostile patient was still strong requiring four or five men to constrain him so that a

1726
02:09:59.80 --> 02:10:03.16
bamboo stick could be forced between his teeth.

1727
02:10:03.16 --> 02:10:05.68
Another prisoner masked rice down his throat.

1728
02:10:05.68 --> 02:10:09.48
When they finished he would gag himself to regurgitate what he thought was poisoned from

1729
02:10:09.48 --> 02:10:13.12
the communists, spewing rice all over the room.

1730
02:10:13.12 --> 02:10:14.84
He was entranced.

1731
02:10:14.84 --> 02:10:19.04
When the Vietnamese entered the room, he refused to bow.

1732
02:10:19.04 --> 02:10:24.72
Angered, a guard screamed, bow, bow, and whipped his fist across the expressionless face.

1733
02:10:24.72 --> 02:10:31.08
The man continued to stand, the guards continued to beat him unmercifully.

1734
02:10:31.08 --> 02:10:33.96
Then you guys continued to see this every six months or so.

1735
02:10:33.96 --> 02:10:40.000
We saw our sick POW comrade transported between solitary confinement and the hospital.

1736
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.56
We felt helpless.

1737
02:10:41.56 --> 02:10:44.88
The only way we could assist was with prayer.

1738
02:10:44.88 --> 02:10:49.48
After September 1970, we never saw him again.

1739
02:10:49.48 --> 02:10:54.48
There's a little more to that story that I did not know when I wrote the book that

1740
02:10:54.48 --> 02:11:00.08
he had been the part of an experiment done by a Cuban.

1741
02:11:00.08 --> 02:11:06.16
The Cuban came over to the communist country and as news we could tell, his sole purpose

1742
02:11:06.16 --> 02:11:12.16
of being in Vietnam was to establish the breaking point of an American fighting man.

1743
02:11:12.16 --> 02:11:16.48
This guy that I'm talking about in the book, and I didn't know his name at the time

1744
02:11:16.48 --> 02:11:22.12
I wrote the book, Earl Kobiel, was actually tortured to insanity.

1745
02:11:22.12 --> 02:11:27.40
That is why he was insane.

1746
02:11:27.40 --> 02:11:31.52
His roommates was a very belligerent.

1747
02:11:31.52 --> 02:11:33.68
Here's another leadership principle.

1748
02:11:33.68 --> 02:11:37.88
You've got a group of guys in that prison cell that were being threatened.

1749
02:11:37.88 --> 02:11:42.88
Some of them had broken bones or lastrations because of this crazy man.

1750
02:11:42.88 --> 02:11:48.12
He goes on a hunger strike and is going to kill himself by not eating.

1751
02:11:48.12 --> 02:11:52.08
They had to decide whether or not they were going to force feed him and keep him alive.

1752
02:11:52.08 --> 02:11:57.08
And bring him back to his belligerence or let him die.

1753
02:11:57.08 --> 02:12:00.000
It was quite a dilemma in the prison camp.

1754
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.32
Quite a dramatic time when that was happening.

1755
02:12:05.32 --> 02:12:06.32
They did.

1756
02:12:06.32 --> 02:12:12.08
They forced feed him and brought him back to help and then the Vietnamese for a reason we never

1757
02:12:12.08 --> 02:12:13.08
really knew.

1758
02:12:13.08 --> 02:12:17.40
Possibly because they saw that we had some control.

1759
02:12:17.40 --> 02:12:19.20
They didn't want to stand that control.

1760
02:12:19.20 --> 02:12:24.84
They pulled him out of that cell, put him in solitary confinement and then he died after

1761
02:12:24.84 --> 02:12:26.84
that.

1762
02:12:26.84 --> 02:12:34.08
But it was a tragic event that a guy would be tortured to the point of insanity.

1763
02:12:34.08 --> 02:12:37.52
And that was the purpose of the torture.

1764
02:12:37.52 --> 02:12:41.02
That's exactly how you said you said they were the purpose of the purpose of the

1765
02:12:41.02 --> 02:12:42.02
purpose of the torture.

1766
02:12:42.02 --> 02:12:48.56
Yeah, to find the breaking point and they found it with cobeal.

1767
02:12:48.56 --> 02:12:54.56
You have another chapter and we touched on this a little bit earlier about faith.

1768
02:12:54.56 --> 02:12:56.64
Going back to the book, I will be done.

1769
02:12:56.64 --> 02:12:57.64
I will be done.

1770
02:12:57.64 --> 02:13:04.44
It seemed presumptuous to try to change God's will to make a deal with the omnipotent.

1771
02:13:04.44 --> 02:13:09.16
If I promised to devote my life to the ministry extreme in exchange for freedom and failed

1772
02:13:09.16 --> 02:13:12.000
to follow through, what then?

1773
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.50
No.

1774
02:13:13.50 --> 02:13:16.60
Trying to bargain with God was unfitting.

1775
02:13:16.60 --> 02:13:19.20
And at the beginning, I offered prayers of acceptance.

1776
02:13:19.20 --> 02:13:24.28
I remembered the experience of seeing the Christ-like shadow in the green knobby room and

1777
02:13:24.28 --> 02:13:28.56
the comfort I felt in that time of great need.

1778
02:13:28.56 --> 02:13:33.20
That day I asked God for strength and do whatever hardship I might face and I prayed for

1779
02:13:33.20 --> 02:13:42.64
Anne, not for her fidelity or success, but for tolerance, courage and most of all her happiness

1780
02:13:42.64 --> 02:13:45.04
with or without me.

1781
02:13:45.04 --> 02:13:51.32
I continued this daily prayer.

1782
02:13:51.32 --> 02:13:57.16
Now this was faith was not just years, but everyone.

1783
02:13:57.16 --> 02:14:04.08
And here we go again showing some of the power that you guys had as prisoners.

1784
02:14:04.08 --> 02:14:09.64
Back to the book, thousands of Bibles had been sent to us from church groups all over the world.

1785
02:14:09.64 --> 02:14:12.80
But the Vietnamese gave us none.

1786
02:14:12.80 --> 02:14:16.96
Everything wasn't enough, so we decided to go on a hunger strike.

1787
02:14:16.96 --> 02:14:22.36
Our senior officer informed the Vietnamese that we simply didn't want more food until we

1788
02:14:22.36 --> 02:14:27.20
could have a Bible and uninterrupted worship.

1789
02:14:27.20 --> 02:14:30.20
They retaliated by shutting off our drinking water.

1790
02:14:30.20 --> 02:14:33.56
After a few days, the Vietnamese were ready to settle.

1791
02:14:33.56 --> 02:14:35.04
And so were we.

1792
02:14:35.04 --> 02:14:40.16
They would give us a church service if we abided by certain stipulations, the service would

1793
02:14:40.16 --> 02:14:45.28
be held according to their schedule, no one could sing, no one could stand, and everyone

1794
02:14:45.28 --> 02:14:48.24
would hear strictly to camp regulations.

1795
02:14:48.24 --> 02:14:53.92
Every word spoken in the ceremony was to be written down for the censors perusal.

1796
02:14:53.92 --> 02:14:57.60
After all the restrictions, we hadn't gained much.

1797
02:14:57.60 --> 02:15:00.92
But at least the V had given an inch.

1798
02:15:00.92 --> 02:15:09.08
After a few weeks later, the V saw that our services were not militant and relaxed restrictions.

1799
02:15:09.08 --> 02:15:12.36
They permitted a foreman choir to sing to him's.

1800
02:15:12.36 --> 02:15:18.24
Most important, they gave us a Bible for two days.

1801
02:15:18.24 --> 02:15:21.16
So you guys decided to hold the line on that one?

1802
02:15:21.16 --> 02:15:22.40
We did.

1803
02:15:22.40 --> 02:15:24.48
And it wasn't easy.

1804
02:15:24.48 --> 02:15:31.90
They an interesting thing, back to the leadership, was the guy who promoted this was a

1805
02:15:31.90 --> 02:15:33.96
very staunch Christian guy.

1806
02:15:33.96 --> 02:15:42.90
The number two in command was an atheist and really had no great interest in having a Bible

1807
02:15:42.90 --> 02:15:44.28
in the cell.

1808
02:15:44.28 --> 02:15:51.88
And so when the number one guy told the Vietnamese that we were going to go on a hunger strike,

1809
02:15:51.88 --> 02:15:52.96
they all amounted out of there.

1810
02:15:52.96 --> 02:15:58.40
They took him away so that the number two guy, the atheist, was suddenly in charge.

1811
02:15:58.40 --> 02:16:02.20
It was interesting to watch what was going to happen here.

1812
02:16:02.20 --> 02:16:06.24
It was very encouraging when the atheist said, continue the hunger strike.

1813
02:16:06.24 --> 02:16:08.44
And we're going to get this Bible.

1814
02:16:08.44 --> 02:16:11.000
That's awesome.

1815
02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:18.28
You talk about their perception of the Vietnamese perception of religion in general.

1816
02:16:18.28 --> 02:16:22.04
Back to the book, the large majority of Vietnamese were not Catholic, however, and when they

1817
02:16:22.04 --> 02:16:28.24
discovered us in prayer as they did only the last year they asked, what you derived from

1818
02:16:28.24 --> 02:16:30.000
this thing got?

1819
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.32
We tried to explain that we received strength, comfort, help, and promise of eternal life.

1820
02:16:35.32 --> 02:16:40.36
These concepts were too difficult for them yet many seemed interested and did not mock

1821
02:16:40.36 --> 02:16:42.80
our beliefs.

1822
02:16:42.80 --> 02:16:48.48
To the diehard Vietnamese communist, the state was their god.

1823
02:16:48.48 --> 02:16:53.20
Their truth, their way, their light, the controlling body in the government to create

1824
02:16:53.20 --> 02:16:57.20
infallible canons without fear of correction.

1825
02:16:57.20 --> 02:17:00.44
Whenever peasants asked, who is the state?

1826
02:17:00.44 --> 02:17:05.60
They were told that they themselves were, and that they had control in making decisions.

1827
02:17:05.60 --> 02:17:09.80
Each was told that he was part of the omniscient state.

1828
02:17:09.80 --> 02:17:14.24
He was, as long as he didn't interfere.

1829
02:17:14.24 --> 02:17:18.40
I consider my confinement in prison to be spiritually beneficial.

1830
02:17:18.40 --> 02:17:25.20
I was given an opportunity that few men have the time to pause, to reflect, and to establish

1831
02:17:25.20 --> 02:17:26.68
priorities.

1832
02:17:26.68 --> 02:17:30.92
I found that my previous value system was unrealistic.

1833
02:17:30.92 --> 02:17:37.52
Striped of all my material wealth, the only beacon I could hone, home in on was my faith

1834
02:17:37.52 --> 02:17:45.32
in an unchanging god.

1835
02:17:45.32 --> 02:17:53.36
And you also went very deep on thoughts around patriotism.

1836
02:17:53.36 --> 02:18:00.12
Here's your talk about patriotism, some POWs were super patriots, feeling the United States

1837
02:18:00.12 --> 02:18:02.32
could do no wrong.

1838
02:18:02.32 --> 02:18:07.48
A few felt that we had made a mistake, and it was time for us to get out.

1839
02:18:07.48 --> 02:18:13.44
With most of the prisoners, I accepted the fact that we were not perfect, but felt that

1840
02:18:13.44 --> 02:18:19.04
we were fighting for a worthy cause and should persevere into the end.

1841
02:18:19.04 --> 02:18:25.40
This is something I brought up on many occasions, the fact of how hard we, when I fought

1842
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:30.24
in the war in Iraq, and we went through extreme measures to try and protect the civilian

1843
02:18:30.24 --> 02:18:32.20
populist and the civilian infrastructure.

1844
02:18:32.20 --> 02:18:33.60
And here's your comments on that.

1845
02:18:33.60 --> 02:18:39.12
Back to the book, great efforts were made to persevere the lives and property of civilians.

1846
02:18:39.12 --> 02:18:44.88
Pilots were threatened with court martial if they failed to pinpoint accurate military targets.

1847
02:18:44.88 --> 02:18:50.44
And to the extent that they would jeopardize their own lives by swooping just above treetops

1848
02:18:50.44 --> 02:18:55.52
to preserve a peasant hut 50 yards from a Sam radar scope.

1849
02:18:55.52 --> 02:19:01.000
The Vietnamese capitalizing on this made targets especially difficult by placing their military

1850
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.56
equipment in the middle of peasant hamlets or next to schools.

1851
02:19:05.56 --> 02:19:14.40
In fact, several anti-aircraft artillery guns were stationed on hospital rooftops.

1852
02:19:14.40 --> 02:19:19.04
And here, your thoughts about the involvement here, the most powerful free nation in history

1853
02:19:19.04 --> 02:19:21.84
could not ideally watch.

1854
02:19:21.84 --> 02:19:27.44
The communist world gobble up and dissolve sovereign nations.

1855
02:19:27.44 --> 02:19:33.52
We had to play the surgeon to exercise the malignant disease of mind control.

1856
02:19:33.52 --> 02:19:35.16
I don't condone war.

1857
02:19:35.16 --> 02:19:41.24
I think there are few justifiable reasons for killing.

1858
02:19:41.24 --> 02:19:45.72
In Vietnam, war was the last ditch effort of international diplomacy.

1859
02:19:45.72 --> 02:19:51.08
It was difficult to justify my six years of imprisonment when politicians with expense paid

1860
02:19:51.08 --> 02:19:56.44
trips to Paris should have solved the problems through negotiation.

1861
02:19:56.44 --> 02:20:01.64
In this case, our negotiations were at the end of their rope.

1862
02:20:01.64 --> 02:20:05.76
The communist didn't understand anything but the big hammer.

1863
02:20:05.76 --> 02:20:11.92
In our B-52s shattered her noise defenses with thousands of bombs, the Vietnamese realized

1864
02:20:11.92 --> 02:20:17.76
we meant business.

1865
02:20:17.76 --> 02:20:25.48
In this thought here, we faced east once a week and pledged our allegiance.

1866
02:20:25.48 --> 02:20:32.92
We contrasted our bill of rights and the constitution to the communist manifesto.

1867
02:20:32.92 --> 02:20:39.000
Daily, we saw how big brother destroyed individuality.

1868
02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.16
We compared our lot with that of the guards.

1869
02:20:44.16 --> 02:20:50.96
While prisoners of war were behind bars, the Vietnamese were captives inside their own bamboo

1870
02:20:50.96 --> 02:20:53.56
borders.

1871
02:20:53.56 --> 02:20:59.000
We consider ourselves more fortunate than they.

1872
02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:06.72
One day, we would leave ourselves.

1873
02:21:06.72 --> 02:21:08.76
Powerful statement.

1874
02:21:08.76 --> 02:21:14.20
That's exactly the way we thought was that they were the prisoners.

1875
02:21:14.20 --> 02:21:21.04
We were always of the belief that we would go home.

1876
02:21:21.04 --> 02:21:22.64
They had to stay there.

1877
02:21:22.64 --> 02:21:25.36
They had to stay in their prison.

1878
02:21:25.36 --> 02:21:29.84
We would eventually be released.

1879
02:21:29.84 --> 02:21:33.28
And you were right.

1880
02:21:33.28 --> 02:21:40.32
During the week of 2021 to 28 January 1973 for the first time treatment was actually humane.

1881
02:21:40.32 --> 02:21:44.64
The Vietnamese set up a volleyball net and allowed us to play or to exercise.

1882
02:21:44.64 --> 02:21:47.000
They gave us books and magazines from home.

1883
02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.24
We knew something was happening.

1884
02:21:50.24 --> 02:21:55.48
You guys started to sense that you talk about this in the book.

1885
02:21:55.48 --> 02:21:56.60
I didn't go into it much.

1886
02:21:56.60 --> 02:21:59.72
There was always some people that were, what would you call them?

1887
02:21:59.72 --> 02:22:02.96
The people that would look at the amount of food you got.

1888
02:22:02.96 --> 02:22:08.80
They would read the amount of rights you'd be given as to some for seeing the future of

1889
02:22:08.80 --> 02:22:09.80
how long you could be.

1890
02:22:09.80 --> 02:22:11.80
And therefore, what would you call them in the book?

1891
02:22:11.80 --> 02:22:15.80
We call them food at Terri.

1892
02:22:15.80 --> 02:22:16.80
I don't know.

1893
02:22:16.80 --> 02:22:17.80
Gastrona.

1894
02:22:17.80 --> 02:22:18.80
Gastrona.

1895
02:22:18.80 --> 02:22:19.80
Gastrona.

1896
02:22:19.80 --> 02:22:20.80
Yes.

1897
02:22:20.80 --> 02:22:21.80
Gastrona.

1898
02:22:21.80 --> 02:22:22.80
Yes.

1899
02:22:22.80 --> 02:22:23.80
Then you were there.

1900
02:22:23.80 --> 02:22:24.80
The game was more rice.

1901
02:22:24.80 --> 02:22:25.80
We must be getting ready to be released.

1902
02:22:25.80 --> 02:22:26.80
You were there that feeling.

1903
02:22:26.80 --> 02:22:30.80
It sounds like once a year, once every 18 months.

1904
02:22:30.80 --> 02:22:31.80
Oh yeah.

1905
02:22:31.80 --> 02:22:32.80
Here it is.

1906
02:22:32.80 --> 02:22:33.80
Oh yeah.

1907
02:22:33.80 --> 02:22:34.80
Of course, the dependent on the person.

1908
02:22:34.80 --> 02:22:39.24
But some of the guys were so optimistic.

1909
02:22:39.24 --> 02:22:41.24
I was an optimist.

1910
02:22:41.24 --> 02:22:43.24
I would think home.

1911
02:22:43.24 --> 02:22:48.76
In fact, when I was first shot down, I thought we had finally given him a job.

1912
02:22:48.76 --> 02:22:49.76
And the big blow.

1913
02:22:49.76 --> 02:22:54.76
We finally brought them to their knees on the 19th May.

1914
02:22:54.76 --> 02:22:58.08
And the first few days in prison, I thought, you know, this is going to be ironic because

1915
02:22:58.08 --> 02:22:59.72
of the wars over.

1916
02:22:59.72 --> 02:23:01.12
And I fly home.

1917
02:23:01.12 --> 02:23:03.56
And my squattern has to take the ship home.

1918
02:23:03.56 --> 02:23:06.52
I will be there to greet them when they come home.

1919
02:23:06.52 --> 02:23:08.72
And that's seriously positive at it.

1920
02:23:08.72 --> 02:23:09.72
That's right.

1921
02:23:09.72 --> 02:23:10.72
There.

1922
02:23:10.72 --> 02:23:11.72
That is optimistic.

1923
02:23:11.72 --> 02:23:12.72
Those poor guys have to ride the ship back.

1924
02:23:12.72 --> 02:23:13.72
I'll be home before them.

1925
02:23:13.72 --> 02:23:17.72
Oh, man.

1926
02:23:17.72 --> 02:23:19.56
That's like I was, I've said this before on the podcast.

1927
02:23:19.56 --> 02:23:24.72
I always, when I'm in a commercial aircraft flying, I always think if this thing blows

1928
02:23:24.72 --> 02:23:26.96
up in the sky, I'm going to live.

1929
02:23:26.96 --> 02:23:27.96
I'm going to be that guy.

1930
02:23:27.96 --> 02:23:29.76
Of course, I'm not going to go.

1931
02:23:29.76 --> 02:23:30.76
Sure.

1932
02:23:30.76 --> 02:23:31.76
Everyone else is going to die.

1933
02:23:31.76 --> 02:23:34.76
Not me.

1934
02:23:34.76 --> 02:23:40.24
And so finally, here we go back to the book.

1935
02:23:40.24 --> 02:23:44.40
The camp commander once again called our group together about 180 of us old timers.

1936
02:23:44.40 --> 02:23:48.96
It was the first time that all prisoners in the camp were gathered in one place.

1937
02:23:48.96 --> 02:23:53.52
We lined up by buildings and military formation and were called to attention by our acting

1938
02:23:53.52 --> 02:23:58.72
wing commander Lieutenant Colonel Norm Gattis.

1939
02:23:58.72 --> 02:24:03.52
Although Vietnamese officials did not recognize our rank structure, they said nothing.

1940
02:24:03.52 --> 02:24:07.76
Camp commander Redden announcement and the interpreter read the translation.

1941
02:24:07.76 --> 02:24:13.20
It had been a long time since I'd heard English worded so professionally.

1942
02:24:13.20 --> 02:24:17.64
When he finished and told us we could go, our wing commander again called us to attention

1943
02:24:17.64 --> 02:24:19.52
and dismissed us.

1944
02:24:19.52 --> 02:24:24.84
With bowed heads, with heads bowed, we walked quietly back to our rooms.

1945
02:24:24.84 --> 02:24:26.80
We were stunned.

1946
02:24:26.80 --> 02:24:32.52
Some had waited for these words for over eight and one half years.

1947
02:24:32.52 --> 02:24:34.68
The war was over.

1948
02:24:34.68 --> 02:24:42.28
We were going home.

1949
02:24:42.28 --> 02:24:44.80
Did that even feel real at that point?

1950
02:24:44.80 --> 02:24:46.92
You know, you're hopes up so many times.

1951
02:24:46.92 --> 02:24:48.12
It really didn't.

1952
02:24:48.12 --> 02:24:50.48
And they tried to trick us many times.

1953
02:24:50.48 --> 02:24:53.08
They would call us in, hey, sign this confession.

1954
02:24:53.08 --> 02:24:56.000
We'll send you home.

1955
02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:02.08
And so even when it happened for real, we couldn't believe it.

1956
02:25:02.08 --> 02:25:08.16
It wasn't really until we finally got a board that's C141 and it took off.

1957
02:25:08.16 --> 02:25:09.76
The wheels in the well.

1958
02:25:09.76 --> 02:25:16.92
And when there was a little bit of a administrative situation when it came time, because

1959
02:25:16.92 --> 02:25:21.84
you guys had all knew that you're going to follow the order that you were capital, the sick

1960
02:25:21.84 --> 02:25:24.28
and injured, we're going to go first.

1961
02:25:24.28 --> 02:25:27.36
Then the enlisted guys were going to go and then order of capture.

1962
02:25:27.36 --> 02:25:28.36
Exactly.

1963
02:25:28.36 --> 02:25:29.84
And that was part of the plums.

1964
02:25:29.84 --> 02:25:30.84
Right.

1965
02:25:30.84 --> 02:25:36.000
That was part of all of the rules that we were binding by.

1966
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:40.76
And so we were in, we were numbered.

1967
02:25:40.76 --> 02:25:43.20
Okay, second-inch of guys went home.

1968
02:25:43.20 --> 02:25:47.76
And then it was our turn, but by number of the data shoot-in.

1969
02:25:47.76 --> 02:25:53.32
And they pulled 20 of us out that were out of order of the shoot down date.

1970
02:25:53.32 --> 02:25:56.44
And we made a big deal of this.

1971
02:25:56.44 --> 02:26:00.64
And they told us, well, it just isn't your told us.

1972
02:26:00.64 --> 02:26:02.76
We almost caused an international incident.

1973
02:26:02.76 --> 02:26:12.44
And for whatever reason that we really never knew for sure, except that all 20 of us had

1974
02:26:12.44 --> 02:26:19.36
some disappointing feature to our return.

1975
02:26:19.36 --> 02:26:21.28
And we never knew if that was the reason or not.

1976
02:26:21.28 --> 02:26:26.56
But we were either coming back to deaths in the family or disease or the voice or that kind

1977
02:26:26.56 --> 02:26:28.44
of thing, all 20 guys.

1978
02:26:28.44 --> 02:26:30.08
And so, but we were out of order.

1979
02:26:30.08 --> 02:26:32.64
And we did not know why we were out of order.

1980
02:26:32.64 --> 02:26:35.56
And so we told them we weren't going home.

1981
02:26:35.56 --> 02:26:42.44
And it went back and forth for almost a day that we refused to go home.

1982
02:26:42.44 --> 02:26:46.76
And then finally Colonel Gattas just pulled you and said, listen, you guys are going

1983
02:26:46.76 --> 02:26:47.76
home.

1984
02:26:47.76 --> 02:26:57.04
You gave us the record.

1985
02:26:57.04 --> 02:27:03.16
And then you get to the airport.

1986
02:27:03.16 --> 02:27:09.64
We extended solemnly through a crowd of people and by microphone we were told to walk to

1987
02:27:09.64 --> 02:27:12.28
our receiving officer when our name is recalled.

1988
02:27:12.28 --> 02:27:15.84
As I heard my name, I stepped past a table where Vietnamese and American representatives

1989
02:27:15.84 --> 02:27:18.16
marked off the exchange.

1990
02:27:18.16 --> 02:27:22.92
I salute the Colonel, then another and was escorted by an officer who was so excited he

1991
02:27:22.92 --> 02:27:25.56
could have said nothing more than isn't it great?

1992
02:27:25.56 --> 02:27:26.84
It's so nice to have you back.

1993
02:27:26.84 --> 02:27:27.96
We've all been waiting for you.

1994
02:27:27.96 --> 02:27:29.24
Isn't it great?

1995
02:27:29.24 --> 02:27:33.80
I felt as though he had previously composed what he would say, but in his excitement

1996
02:27:33.80 --> 02:27:35.80
his record stuck.

1997
02:27:35.80 --> 02:27:37.12
He was right.

1998
02:27:37.12 --> 02:27:38.12
It was great.

1999
02:27:38.12 --> 02:27:43.000
I walked up on the ramp of the C141 and saw the first Navy uniform.

2000
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.24
The officer inside that uniform grabbed me and hugged me and told me his name.

2001
02:27:46.24 --> 02:27:49.88
I didn't know him until he told me he was the briefing officer on the Kitty Hawk.

2002
02:27:49.88 --> 02:27:52.08
The day I was shot down.

2003
02:27:52.08 --> 02:27:57.68
Gary Moro and I had once worked many hours together and now we could joyfully recall old

2004
02:27:57.68 --> 02:27:59.68
times.

2005
02:27:59.68 --> 02:28:03.72
As soon as I was in the airplane and nurse kissed me and started the first of a long chain

2006
02:28:03.72 --> 02:28:08.84
of flash bulbs we were given American cigarettes, magazines, and information sheets telling

2007
02:28:08.84 --> 02:28:11.80
us what to expect at Clark Air Force Base.

2008
02:28:11.80 --> 02:28:18.000
The pilot taxi down the runway pushed out, pushed the throttles and at the moment of lift

2009
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
off suddenly it hit us.

2010
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.48
We were off of North Vietnamese soil.

2011
02:28:22.48 --> 02:28:25.76
We screamed above the noise of the engines.

2012
02:28:25.76 --> 02:28:31.72
Minutes later, we were soaring above the Gulf of Tauken and saw some of our ships.

2013
02:28:31.72 --> 02:28:37.32
The commander of the seventh fleet sent a message of welcome and Jim returned the radio

2014
02:28:37.32 --> 02:28:40.80
calm with a thankful acknowledgement.

2015
02:28:40.80 --> 02:28:45.72
By nightfall we reached the Philippines in Clark Air Force Base as soon as the doors opened

2016
02:28:45.72 --> 02:28:50.92
and we could see and hear the enthusiasm from what must have been 5,000 people, banners

2017
02:28:50.92 --> 02:28:55.96
and bands, coral groups and cheerleaders, everyone seemed to be there.

2018
02:28:55.96 --> 02:29:00.68
I walked down the ramp, saluted a general and then an admiral.

2019
02:29:00.68 --> 02:29:12.84
As I shook the admiral's hand I was so overcome with emotion that I hugged him.

2020
02:29:12.84 --> 02:29:13.84
So you hugged the admiral.

2021
02:29:13.84 --> 02:29:18.12
That was embarrassing.

2022
02:29:18.12 --> 02:29:20.12
I didn't know why I did that.

2023
02:29:20.12 --> 02:29:21.76
It was just a little bit of a circus.

2024
02:29:21.76 --> 02:29:26.60
Maybe it's maybe they take us to the outfit that you could go for six years.

2025
02:29:26.60 --> 02:29:27.60
I would have all given.

2026
02:29:27.60 --> 02:29:29.20
I think I would have kissed him.

2027
02:29:29.20 --> 02:29:31.20
It'd been on.

2028
02:29:31.20 --> 02:29:33.56
Thank you sir.

2029
02:29:33.56 --> 02:29:36.60
Yes sir, you're allowed to hug the admiral when you come home after that.

2030
02:29:36.60 --> 02:29:40.88
I could tell when you wrote that you were sort of like, oh, what I just do.

2031
02:29:40.88 --> 02:29:48.48
Exactly, overcoming the emotions and then you start kind of the in-processing thing.

2032
02:29:48.48 --> 02:29:49.96
And I'm that out of it.

2033
02:29:49.96 --> 02:29:53.64
When they start handing you magazines, cigarettes and food and all that, you go into that

2034
02:29:53.64 --> 02:29:57.52
someone in here and they're just overwhelming as that.

2035
02:29:57.52 --> 02:29:58.92
That was wonderful.

2036
02:29:58.92 --> 02:30:01.88
It was joyful.

2037
02:30:01.88 --> 02:30:10.000
I was reading through some Vietnam POW poetry and I got caught.

2038
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.24
You know, I was just looking for background.

2039
02:30:12.24 --> 02:30:16.08
I want to learn more and people express themselves in poetry.

2040
02:30:16.08 --> 02:30:19.60
I've got locked into probably a dozen poems.

2041
02:30:19.60 --> 02:30:22.76
That was nothing but different foods.

2042
02:30:22.76 --> 02:30:28.36
Raspberry cake and milk and chocolate milk and everything.

2043
02:30:28.36 --> 02:30:32.56
There was like a dozen poems that were just about food.

2044
02:30:32.56 --> 02:30:35.76
My favorite one was Jerry Coffee wrote a poem.

2045
02:30:35.76 --> 02:30:38.32
It was called Ode to a Weevil.

2046
02:30:38.32 --> 02:30:41.44
The poem was Little Weevil in my bread.

2047
02:30:41.44 --> 02:30:45.88
I think I just bit off your head.

2048
02:30:45.88 --> 02:30:46.88
That was it.

2049
02:30:46.88 --> 02:30:53.92
That was the end of the weevil too.

2050
02:30:53.92 --> 02:30:58.44
So you guys are, you know, that had to be somewhat overwhelming.

2051
02:30:58.44 --> 02:31:05.000
But you know, like you said, you guys were in good, relatively good mental status.

2052
02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Wait, where?

2053
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Yeah.

2054
02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Amazing.

2055
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:13.04
Now, as you're going through the motions with the doctors and the physical people and

2056
02:31:13.04 --> 02:31:18.96
the the the the the the the the public affairs people, you're saying, hey, you know, what

2057
02:31:18.96 --> 02:31:19.96
do I see my wife?

2058
02:31:19.96 --> 02:31:24.84
What's up with my wife and no one's really answering that question for you and find

2059
02:31:24.84 --> 02:31:27.24
you get the chaplain.

2060
02:31:27.24 --> 02:31:31.40
And you say, going back to the book here, I looked up at him and said chaplain, I have a

2061
02:31:31.40 --> 02:31:34.92
great deal with faith in you and I want you to level with me.

2062
02:31:34.92 --> 02:31:38.12
So far, I haven't been able to get a straight answer from anyone and I want to know about

2063
02:31:38.12 --> 02:31:41.92
my wife, would you please be kind enough to tell me what's going on?

2064
02:31:41.92 --> 02:31:46.48
And he says back well, Charlie, there is a problem with your wife.

2065
02:31:46.48 --> 02:31:49.60
She is well, but she has some misgivings.

2066
02:31:49.60 --> 02:31:54.60
I'm not sure so the extent, but I'm sure that everything is going to be alright.

2067
02:31:54.60 --> 02:31:58.44
She's written me a letter, but I didn't want to open it.

2068
02:31:58.44 --> 02:32:01.56
I felt that you should.

2069
02:32:01.56 --> 02:32:09.52
You get the letter and it's nothing crystal clear, but the message is clear enough that, you

2070
02:32:09.52 --> 02:32:19.36
know, she's not want the stay married to you anymore.

2071
02:32:19.36 --> 02:32:24.12
And you call her the next day.

2072
02:32:24.12 --> 02:32:29.16
Actually, call my parents first, okay, back in Kansas.

2073
02:32:29.16 --> 02:32:33.24
I tried to call her, but it didn't work.

2074
02:32:33.24 --> 02:32:36.40
In fact, they were very protective.

2075
02:32:36.40 --> 02:32:43.28
First of all, they thought I might be suicidal when I heard the news.

2076
02:32:43.28 --> 02:32:48.08
So they were very protective of me.

2077
02:32:48.08 --> 02:32:53.40
They wouldn't let me call home, even the chaplain in the psychiatrist and psychologist wouldn't

2078
02:32:53.40 --> 02:32:55.84
call home, even to your parents.

2079
02:32:55.84 --> 02:32:56.84
Even to my parents.

2080
02:32:56.84 --> 02:32:57.84
Yeah.

2081
02:32:57.84 --> 02:33:02.48
They had this plan of how they were going to explain this to me, I guess.

2082
02:33:02.48 --> 02:33:03.68
But they wouldn't let me call.

2083
02:33:03.68 --> 02:33:08.36
I finally found a social worker in the hospital.

2084
02:33:08.36 --> 02:33:13.92
You know, hey, I want to tell a phone around here and so I found a phone.

2085
02:33:13.92 --> 02:33:16.60
I call my parents back in Kansas.

2086
02:33:16.60 --> 02:33:19.76
And they were the ones that actually told me.

2087
02:33:19.76 --> 02:33:21.60
You know, never forget my mom's words.

2088
02:33:21.60 --> 02:33:23.88
She said, I sent a gift to you.

2089
02:33:23.88 --> 02:33:25.84
Here's my life if I didn't have to tell you this.

2090
02:33:25.84 --> 02:33:30.08
But she's engaged to be married to another man.

2091
02:33:30.08 --> 02:33:31.84
She's filed for divorce.

2092
02:33:31.84 --> 02:33:34.48
And Judge wouldn't give her divorce.

2093
02:33:34.48 --> 02:33:39.84
The justification was abandonment.

2094
02:33:39.84 --> 02:33:43.60
You know, she's her husband and her.

2095
02:33:43.60 --> 02:33:45.84
And the judge wasn't buying that.

2096
02:33:45.84 --> 02:33:51.16
And so, but no, that was the first thing that was when my mother told me that she had

2097
02:33:51.16 --> 02:33:55.20
filed for divorce.

2098
02:33:55.20 --> 02:33:59.64
You know, I don't want back to the book here.

2099
02:33:59.64 --> 02:34:01.12
A few days later, so you talk to Anne.

2100
02:34:01.12 --> 02:34:08.76
But then some of the stuff you say here is, I actually, I just have to quote it, back the

2101
02:34:08.76 --> 02:34:12.80
book, yet Anne had told me that she wanted to remarry.

2102
02:34:12.80 --> 02:34:16.76
I would not become an obstacle to her happiness.

2103
02:34:16.76 --> 02:34:20.16
I called her parents and they seemed quite unsettled about Anne's decision.

2104
02:34:20.16 --> 02:34:24.24
A few days later, I called Anne again and she complained that many members in the news media

2105
02:34:24.24 --> 02:34:26.04
had been harassing her.

2106
02:34:26.04 --> 02:34:31.08
She said she'd often been misquoted and was the victim of character assassination.

2107
02:34:31.08 --> 02:34:35.28
I then talked personally to some of the newspaper men and told them that I did not want

2108
02:34:35.28 --> 02:34:37.28
her to be maligned in any way.

2109
02:34:37.28 --> 02:34:41.28
In fact, I wanted them to say nothing at all about my wife.

2110
02:34:41.28 --> 02:34:43.44
For the most part, they were receptive to my wishes.

2111
02:34:43.44 --> 02:34:46.52
I gave them a quote which they could use if they felt they had to.

2112
02:34:46.52 --> 02:34:52.96
The divorce is a regrettable, but inevitable drifting apart after so many years.

2113
02:34:52.96 --> 02:34:56.56
By this time, my hope for reconciliation was dead.

2114
02:34:56.56 --> 02:35:01.72
I was determined to take it on the chin and roll with the punches.

2115
02:35:01.72 --> 02:35:08.52
Well, I may be coming off as a white knight here, but it wasn't at all that way.

2116
02:35:08.52 --> 02:35:15.72
I really, to this day, believe that in many ways, the ladies had it worse than we did.

2117
02:35:15.72 --> 02:35:18.56
And it's the family's back here.

2118
02:35:18.56 --> 02:35:22.76
The military guys are over there and I'm sure you've seen this in your experience as

2119
02:35:22.76 --> 02:35:23.76
well.

2120
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:29.76
We believe in what we're doing, we're dedicated, we focused, we're over there having

2121
02:35:29.76 --> 02:35:31.16
a high-altime.

2122
02:35:31.16 --> 02:35:33.36
The family's back here don't have that.

2123
02:35:33.36 --> 02:35:39.44
And especially my wife didn't know if I was a live or dead from one day to the next.

2124
02:35:39.44 --> 02:35:44.04
She went through the same years, 24 to 30 that I did.

2125
02:35:44.04 --> 02:35:48.48
She was supposed to be faithful to me and she was supposed to believe that I'd come

2126
02:35:48.48 --> 02:35:54.000
home, not knowing if I'd ever come home, and if I did, would I still want to be married

2127
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:59.28
or would I be a basket case and a burden to her or the rest of her life?

2128
02:35:59.28 --> 02:36:06.12
And the other part of this, which was, which I didn't know at the time, of course, but

2129
02:36:06.12 --> 02:36:08.08
she lost her support group.

2130
02:36:08.08 --> 02:36:12.68
You know, they had a big wives club, the squadron pilots, all of our wives got together.

2131
02:36:12.68 --> 02:36:16.96
And they would take pictures and send us cookies and make tapes and all these things.

2132
02:36:16.96 --> 02:36:20.96
It was a very close net group, the wives of the pilots.

2133
02:36:20.96 --> 02:36:27.24
Well, when I was shot down or when anybody was killed or captured, that wife was sort

2134
02:36:27.24 --> 02:36:30.72
of similarly shunned by the rest of the group.

2135
02:36:30.72 --> 02:36:41.40
Not officially, but just because they didn't want to, they didn't want to be associated

2136
02:36:41.40 --> 02:36:43.72
with somebody who had that problem.

2137
02:36:43.72 --> 02:36:46.92
They didn't want that to affect their life.

2138
02:36:46.92 --> 02:36:50.24
So she lost her support group.

2139
02:36:50.24 --> 02:36:55.64
She went back to Kansas and went back to school there.

2140
02:36:55.64 --> 02:37:00.72
And then when she fell in love with this other guy, she lost what support groups she had

2141
02:37:00.72 --> 02:37:03.16
at home, because her parents were upset.

2142
02:37:03.16 --> 02:37:05.36
My parents were upset.

2143
02:37:05.36 --> 02:37:09.44
I have a brother, 10 years younger than I am, that looks a lot like me.

2144
02:37:09.44 --> 02:37:15.28
And he was of the, about the same age during this, the letter part of this experience

2145
02:37:15.28 --> 02:37:18.52
that I had been when, when Anne and I met.

2146
02:37:18.52 --> 02:37:25.24
And he would go over to Moher Lawn in Kansas and she would break out in hives, serious,

2147
02:37:25.24 --> 02:37:31.04
emergency room kind of hives just at the sight of my little brother, because he looked like

2148
02:37:31.04 --> 02:37:32.04
me.

2149
02:37:32.04 --> 02:37:38.72
And so they finally, the doctors restricted him from ever seeing her because it caused

2150
02:37:38.72 --> 02:37:41.12
her so much grief.

2151
02:37:41.12 --> 02:37:42.60
So it was tough on the ladies.

2152
02:37:42.60 --> 02:37:49.32
Anyway, you look at it and I saw that and I felt that and I felt like I needed to do whatever

2153
02:37:49.32 --> 02:37:53.12
was necessary to give her a little piece.

2154
02:37:53.12 --> 02:37:57.88
Well, you might not think you came off like a white night, but that's pretty, you know,

2155
02:37:57.88 --> 02:38:01.52
awesome treatment of someone for sure.

2156
02:38:01.52 --> 02:38:07.64
Well, and a lot of people, you know, didn't understand it then and even don't understand

2157
02:38:07.64 --> 02:38:08.64
it today.

2158
02:38:08.64 --> 02:38:17.16
You know, some people want to blame her, but I have no animosity, no blame whatsoever

2159
02:38:17.16 --> 02:38:18.16
for what she did.

2160
02:38:18.16 --> 02:38:24.84
I mean, it was, I have other people that will say, well, don't you wish that she had

2161
02:38:24.84 --> 02:38:27.88
known early on that she was going to divorce you?

2162
02:38:27.88 --> 02:38:28.88
No way.

2163
02:38:28.88 --> 02:38:29.88
No, no, no.

2164
02:38:29.88 --> 02:38:33.28
No, her, her, the thoughts of her kept me alive.

2165
02:38:33.28 --> 02:38:37.68
You know, that was, I mean, that was my purpose was to go back and be with her.

2166
02:38:37.68 --> 02:38:42.60
The fact that it didn't happen, of course, is somewhat incidental, but the six years

2167
02:38:42.60 --> 02:38:43.60
I was there.

2168
02:38:43.60 --> 02:38:48.92
It was certainly a positive for me to think about her.

2169
02:38:48.92 --> 02:38:56.80
And you wrap up the book with a chapter called Reflections, which is just phenomenal.

2170
02:38:56.80 --> 02:39:02.16
And, you know, looking back at kind of what you learned there.

2171
02:39:02.16 --> 02:39:08.64
And I'm going to hit some of the parts of it because there's so much that everybody

2172
02:39:08.64 --> 02:39:12.32
can learn from this.

2173
02:39:12.32 --> 02:39:16.84
Going here to the book, our closed society subsisted.

2174
02:39:16.84 --> 02:39:19.20
We ate, slept, breathed.

2175
02:39:19.20 --> 02:39:21.36
We laughed and we cried.

2176
02:39:21.36 --> 02:39:24.52
We were frustrated and we were gratified.

2177
02:39:24.52 --> 02:39:27.68
We were embarrassed and we were proud.

2178
02:39:27.68 --> 02:39:33.68
And slowly, almost imperceptibly, particularly patterns of behavior, edged into our daily

2179
02:39:33.68 --> 02:39:37.36
activities and came until they became full-quies.

2180
02:39:37.36 --> 02:39:43.24
There was nothing unusual about a man pacing the floor for hours like a cage tiger.

2181
02:39:43.24 --> 02:39:49.40
No one, no notice was given to the man lifting his soup bowl and licking its spotless.

2182
02:39:49.40 --> 02:39:53.60
There was no stigma in bearing our souls to one another.

2183
02:39:53.60 --> 02:39:57.36
We had our own mourns and sense of propriety.

2184
02:39:57.36 --> 02:40:03.04
Our microcosm was a petri dish containing its own strains and culture.

2185
02:40:03.04 --> 02:40:08.92
Although we had not been hand-picked, we were, for the most part, out of the same mold,

2186
02:40:08.92 --> 02:40:12.04
that of the professional officer and pilot.

2187
02:40:12.04 --> 02:40:17.76
We were unique prisoners who acted differently from those of Korea, World War II.

2188
02:40:17.76 --> 02:40:23.20
We had been exposed to a different selection process and a new era of lifestyles.

2189
02:40:23.20 --> 02:40:31.96
Rather together in a dubious fraternity of Hanoi skydivers, we were a group of cocky individuals.

2190
02:40:31.96 --> 02:40:34.96
We knew we were the best.

2191
02:40:34.96 --> 02:40:40.20
Strip the personal possessions of million dollar airplanes, of rank and prestige.

2192
02:40:40.20 --> 02:40:44.96
We suddenly found ourselves at the bottom of a dark pit.

2193
02:40:44.96 --> 02:40:48.80
We could no longer look outward.

2194
02:40:48.80 --> 02:40:58.04
Our only alternative was to make the best of what we had.

2195
02:40:58.04 --> 02:41:05.40
And when you have so little and for you guys to take that attitude, then there's so many

2196
02:41:05.40 --> 02:41:10.68
people, you know, and I hear from people all over the world that will reach out to me and

2197
02:41:10.68 --> 02:41:15.16
talk about the situation that they're in a bad situation and negative situation.

2198
02:41:15.16 --> 02:41:20.68
And you know, it's hearing from people like you that makes everyone realize, I need to make

2199
02:41:20.68 --> 02:41:22.08
the best of what I have.

2200
02:41:22.08 --> 02:41:26.72
I need to make the best of the situation on them because if you guys could do it, anyone

2201
02:41:26.72 --> 02:41:29.32
could do it?

2202
02:41:29.32 --> 02:41:37.72
Again, this sounds like Grand High Level Philosophy, but it was almost a survival technique.

2203
02:41:37.72 --> 02:41:45.56
You know, if it's almost, hey, this is the way that we can make it through this is believing

2204
02:41:45.56 --> 02:41:48.60
in the future and believing in ourselves.

2205
02:41:48.60 --> 02:41:54.04
And I look back on that six years and it was probably the most important six years of

2206
02:41:54.04 --> 02:41:57.20
my life because I came through this.

2207
02:41:57.20 --> 02:42:04.64
So we experience with this kind of discipline, it's kind of thought process.

2208
02:42:04.64 --> 02:42:07.24
Hey, it's not the end of your doubt.

2209
02:42:07.24 --> 02:42:08.72
It's the way you play the hand you're done.

2210
02:42:08.72 --> 02:42:15.68
You may not end for a sister's around, you know, you may have trash.

2211
02:42:15.68 --> 02:42:22.20
But if you play it right, it can still be a winning hand.

2212
02:42:22.20 --> 02:42:24.68
A little bit of talk about you coming home, back to the book.

2213
02:42:24.68 --> 02:42:27.68
My first impressions of home were not too encouraging.

2214
02:42:27.68 --> 02:42:32.56
Newspapers and magazines were devoted largely to the drug problem, permissiveness, the energy

2215
02:42:32.56 --> 02:42:39.16
crisis, abounding, crime rate, and eroding, and eroding, and eroding family structures.

2216
02:42:39.16 --> 02:42:42.36
I was worried, worried from a selfish viewpoint.

2217
02:42:42.36 --> 02:42:46.64
I had sacrificed many years for my country and I didn't want some young whippersnappers

2218
02:42:46.64 --> 02:42:48.48
destroying it.

2219
02:42:48.48 --> 02:42:53.40
But I decided to give myself a one year moratorium before taking a firm stand on any of my

2220
02:42:53.40 --> 02:42:56.16
observations.

2221
02:42:56.16 --> 02:43:01.32
And I found that the news media in particular had exaggerated the negative.

2222
02:43:01.32 --> 02:43:07.56
I didn't have my wallet stolen nor did I see opium dents or gang wars when I visited

2223
02:43:07.56 --> 02:43:09.16
schools.

2224
02:43:09.16 --> 02:43:12.92
Instead I was pleasantly surprised with student demeanor.

2225
02:43:12.92 --> 02:43:17.72
Young people freely ask questions and show to genuine concern for answers.

2226
02:43:17.72 --> 02:43:23.80
To me, they seem to have been unduly criticized by an inpatient adult society rather than

2227
02:43:23.80 --> 02:43:27.80
given been given wise counsel.

2228
02:43:27.80 --> 02:43:33.32
They have more freedom and I think they are generally capable of handling those freedoms.

2229
02:43:33.32 --> 02:43:37.40
They are more mature than their counterparts of my generation.

2230
02:43:37.40 --> 02:43:40.20
They have to be to survive.

2231
02:43:40.20 --> 02:43:45.32
And one of the reasons I called that little section out is because guess what we hear about

2232
02:43:45.32 --> 02:43:46.92
the millennials right now.

2233
02:43:46.92 --> 02:43:50.40
We hear the same thing about the millennials.

2234
02:43:50.40 --> 02:43:54.64
And maybe just everyone should give a little moratorium on themselves.

2235
02:43:54.64 --> 02:43:58.16
I'm going to start imposing more moratoriums on myself.

2236
02:43:58.16 --> 02:44:00.16
That's a great idea.

2237
02:44:00.16 --> 02:44:02.000
We have to start definitely doing that.

2238
02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
So for those moratoriums.

2239
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:10.08
Yeah, you hear me with a we work with a lot of businesses and companies and people ask us about

2240
02:44:10.08 --> 02:44:13.68
we got these millennials and so hard to lead them.

2241
02:44:13.68 --> 02:44:15.32
And I say, oh, why is that?

2242
02:44:15.32 --> 02:44:18.000
Because they want to understand why they are doing what they are doing?

2243
02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.68
Because they want to know what the goal and purpose of their job is.

2244
02:44:21.68 --> 02:44:23.08
That's nothing new.

2245
02:44:23.08 --> 02:44:27.84
Oh, because they're because they want to step up and run things.

2246
02:44:27.84 --> 02:44:31.64
I want that person working for me.

2247
02:44:31.64 --> 02:44:36.32
So yeah, put a little moratorium.

2248
02:44:36.32 --> 02:44:39.96
Right.

2249
02:44:39.96 --> 02:44:40.96
Back to the book.

2250
02:44:40.96 --> 02:44:41.96
Wall and prison.

2251
02:44:41.96 --> 02:44:43.76
I had a lot of time to think.

2252
02:44:43.76 --> 02:44:45.88
The same question kept popping in my mind.

2253
02:44:45.88 --> 02:44:47.28
What am I doing here?

2254
02:44:47.28 --> 02:44:51.60
I'm 10,000 miles from home, cooped up in a communist prison camp, unable to enjoy all the

2255
02:44:51.60 --> 02:44:52.60
wonderful freedoms.

2256
02:44:52.60 --> 02:44:55.52
I was sent here to protect.

2257
02:44:55.52 --> 02:44:57.04
My first answer was obvious.

2258
02:44:57.04 --> 02:44:58.32
I'm fighting for my country.

2259
02:44:58.32 --> 02:45:01.16
I'm serving the United States of America.

2260
02:45:01.16 --> 02:45:05.88
I'd learned in school that America was purple mountain majesties and amber and brohaves

2261
02:45:05.88 --> 02:45:07.72
of grain.

2262
02:45:07.72 --> 02:45:12.04
That it was Congress and the executive and the judiciary.

2263
02:45:12.04 --> 02:45:13.40
These were self-evident.

2264
02:45:13.40 --> 02:45:15.72
But I had to get more personal than that.

2265
02:45:15.72 --> 02:45:18.52
America had to mean more.

2266
02:45:18.52 --> 02:45:24.04
It had to relate to my own freedoms, the product of nearly 200 years of a pioneering

2267
02:45:24.04 --> 02:45:26.20
spirit.

2268
02:45:26.20 --> 02:45:32.24
My nation is a skinny kid who climbs on his bike before dawn to sling newspapers.

2269
02:45:32.24 --> 02:45:37.84
My country is a librarian who sits behind glasses with pencil in her hair and is quick

2270
02:45:37.84 --> 02:45:40.76
to find answers to my questions.

2271
02:45:40.76 --> 02:45:46.80
My homeland is a truck driver who smiles down from his cab and signals me through the

2272
02:45:46.80 --> 02:45:48.84
intersection.

2273
02:45:48.84 --> 02:45:58.76
My America is a personal friend and I am proud to serve her.

2274
02:45:58.76 --> 02:46:05.12
And you go on to say that there must be a thousand definitions for freedom.

2275
02:46:05.12 --> 02:46:06.40
Mine is simple.

2276
02:46:06.40 --> 02:46:10.56
Freedom is the ability to walk through the door.

2277
02:46:10.56 --> 02:46:12.48
It's not the act of walking through.

2278
02:46:12.48 --> 02:46:14.36
That's proof of freedom.

2279
02:46:14.36 --> 02:46:20.04
Not going to church or speaking ones mind or demonstrating in the streets.

2280
02:46:20.04 --> 02:46:25.80
Freedom is the ability to choose whether to go to church to step up on a soap box to carry

2281
02:46:25.80 --> 02:46:29.08
placards.

2282
02:46:29.08 --> 02:46:34.04
Now that I am released again I move about it will.

2283
02:46:34.04 --> 02:46:35.96
I say what I wish.

2284
02:46:35.96 --> 02:46:39.36
I criticize and take criticism.

2285
02:46:39.36 --> 02:46:45.56
I feel free now than ever before because I know what freedom is.

2286
02:46:45.56 --> 02:46:52.04
I appreciate those freedoms because I was once denied them.

2287
02:46:52.04 --> 02:46:53.36
Is there anything?

2288
02:46:53.36 --> 02:46:57.04
Is there anybody that appreciates freedoms more than people that have had those freedoms

2289
02:46:57.04 --> 02:46:58.04
denied?

2290
02:46:58.04 --> 02:47:00.84
Probably not.

2291
02:47:00.84 --> 02:47:06.36
Is there any way to transfer the appreciation for those freedoms?

2292
02:47:06.36 --> 02:47:08.08
I mean I am doing my darn best.

2293
02:47:08.08 --> 02:47:10.56
You are doing your darnest.

2294
02:47:10.56 --> 02:47:11.96
You are in the same business.

2295
02:47:11.96 --> 02:47:13.76
I speak a couple of times a week.

2296
02:47:13.76 --> 02:47:15.80
All of the country has since I came up.

2297
02:47:15.80 --> 02:47:22.48
Trying to impress this on people but the truth is there is no way that you or I can put

2298
02:47:22.48 --> 02:47:27.20
people in that situation that we have been in and make them feel the way they feel.

2299
02:47:27.20 --> 02:47:31.52
There is no way I could deny a person freedom.

2300
02:47:31.52 --> 02:47:40.000
I do corporate workshops as you do and I will put it a person in a room by themselves

2301
02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:44.000
with nothing there for 15 minutes and they go crazy.

2302
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.52
Do you take their phone away from them?

2303
02:47:46.52 --> 02:47:48.88
You can cut that down to 5v8xx.

2304
02:47:48.88 --> 02:47:52.28
They are going nuts.

2305
02:47:52.28 --> 02:47:57.08
There is very little, well I should say this way.

2306
02:47:57.08 --> 02:48:01.60
It is difficult to make that transfer to make a person that appreciate freedom when they

2307
02:48:01.60 --> 02:48:06.76
have never lost theirs and all I can do is tell the story.

2308
02:48:06.76 --> 02:48:10.48
I appreciate your helping me tell the story.

2309
02:48:10.48 --> 02:48:12.60
Trying over here.

2310
02:48:12.60 --> 02:48:18.76
How many occasions do I have to go a little bit of the distance on some stuff that I have

2311
02:48:18.76 --> 02:48:19.76
to read here?

2312
02:48:19.76 --> 02:48:24.000
I am one of those situations to wrap up because I think this is just such an important

2313
02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.20
message for me for everybody.

2314
02:48:27.20 --> 02:48:32.24
Back to the book, I am often asked how did you do it commander?

2315
02:48:32.24 --> 02:48:37.52
How could you take six years of filth brutality and loneliness?

2316
02:48:37.52 --> 02:48:40.64
I could have never done it.

2317
02:48:40.64 --> 02:48:43.64
My answer is of course you could.

2318
02:48:43.64 --> 02:48:49.56
As a matter of fact you rub elbows each day with people who have done it.

2319
02:48:49.56 --> 02:48:54.96
We weren't the only prisoners, millions of Americans have experienced the manacles of the

2320
02:48:54.96 --> 02:48:58.44
body or shackles of the mind.

2321
02:48:58.44 --> 02:49:04.84
They have been bound by unfortunate external circumstances, automobile accidents, disease,

2322
02:49:04.84 --> 02:49:09.96
natural disaster, paralyzing grief from the loss of a loved one.

2323
02:49:09.96 --> 02:49:15.80
They have suffered deprivation and humiliation.

2324
02:49:15.80 --> 02:49:22.40
In the midst of victims of misfortune many become too insecure to open doors.

2325
02:49:22.40 --> 02:49:25.40
Instead they allow themselves to wallow in despair.

2326
02:49:25.40 --> 02:49:33.04
They become alcoholics, drug addicts, unfaithful wives or husbands, unruly children.

2327
02:49:33.04 --> 02:49:40.08
In the ability to face personal responsibility is often hidden and seemingly innocent pastimes.

2328
02:49:40.08 --> 02:49:44.60
Golf, poker, television, sleep.

2329
02:49:44.60 --> 02:49:50.76
These diversion spawn intense feeling of guilt and worthlessness.

2330
02:49:50.76 --> 02:49:58.40
And some victims ultimately isolate themselves and become despondent.

2331
02:49:58.40 --> 02:50:02.60
A few commit suicide.

2332
02:50:02.60 --> 02:50:10.40
I had ample opportunity to dam society and curse my fate.

2333
02:50:10.40 --> 02:50:14.16
But what good would that have done?

2334
02:50:14.16 --> 02:50:21.40
To be sure the Vietnamese would not have released me simply because I felt sorry for myself.

2335
02:50:21.40 --> 02:50:28.32
On the contrary they used every available means to make that happen.

2336
02:50:28.32 --> 02:50:35.68
A despondent prisoner was a prime candidate for communist indoctrination.

2337
02:50:35.68 --> 02:50:43.12
My secret for enduring six years of hell is really not a secret at all.

2338
02:50:43.12 --> 02:50:47.52
Just in formal if I had faith in God.

2339
02:50:47.52 --> 02:50:49.64
Knowing that his will would be done.

2340
02:50:49.64 --> 02:50:52.36
I never doubted that I could persevere.

2341
02:50:52.36 --> 02:50:57.04
I simply trusted God's promise to answer my prayers.

2342
02:50:57.04 --> 02:51:01.48
I also loved my country, its people, and its freedoms.

2343
02:51:01.48 --> 02:51:07.44
I realized that because of the human element mistakes could be made.

2344
02:51:07.44 --> 02:51:13.60
And growing up I had discerned that most of the people in this great land are honorable

2345
02:51:13.60 --> 02:51:16.60
and compassionate.

2346
02:51:16.60 --> 02:51:19.76
Second, I had self-discipline.

2347
02:51:19.76 --> 02:51:26.20
It would have been easier to avoid church torture by succumbing to North Vietnamese interrogation.

2348
02:51:26.20 --> 02:51:32.28
It would have been easier to assume helplessness by blaming an evil world.

2349
02:51:32.28 --> 02:51:39.28
I could have rationalized myself into mental and physical paralysis.

2350
02:51:39.28 --> 02:51:47.68
However, strict self-obedience gave me the ability to persevere.

2351
02:51:47.68 --> 02:51:50.40
Finally, I had pride.

2352
02:51:50.40 --> 02:51:54.92
I was proud to know and am nipitant God.

2353
02:51:54.92 --> 02:51:57.84
I was proud of my country and its heritage.

2354
02:51:57.84 --> 02:52:03.44
I was proud of my family, I was proud of myself.

2355
02:52:03.44 --> 02:52:07.36
Faith, discipline, pride.

2356
02:52:07.36 --> 02:52:11.24
Each of these nurtured the others.

2357
02:52:11.24 --> 02:52:16.92
Combined, they allowed me to endure.

2358
02:52:16.92 --> 02:52:23.44
I have joined the ranks of millions of Americans who have applied heroic principles in overcoming

2359
02:52:23.44 --> 02:52:25.72
hardships.

2360
02:52:25.72 --> 02:52:30.04
Every day, a disabled veteran steps away from his wheelchair.

2361
02:52:30.04 --> 02:52:35.12
Every day, a life is resumed after a death in the family.

2362
02:52:35.12 --> 02:52:38.24
Friendships erase loneliness.

2363
02:52:38.24 --> 02:52:45.16
AddX throw away the crutch of alcohol or drugs or obsessions.

2364
02:52:45.16 --> 02:52:49.76
Every day, someone discovers how to love life.

2365
02:52:49.76 --> 02:52:53.24
No matter what the obstacle.

2366
02:52:53.24 --> 02:52:59.84
Every day, someone sees the light at the end of the tunnel.

2367
02:52:59.84 --> 02:53:05.72
These ordinary Americans are not held in a steam as heroes, yet they have suffered grave

2368
02:53:05.72 --> 02:53:09.24
misfortune and have recovered.

2369
02:53:09.24 --> 02:53:12.56
Just as I.

2370
02:53:12.56 --> 02:53:22.76
So you see, I'm no hero.

2371
02:53:22.76 --> 02:53:29.60
And I think it's that very humility, sir, that makes you a hero because you are certainly

2372
02:53:29.60 --> 02:53:34.20
a hero to me and certainly a hero to this great nation.

2373
02:53:34.20 --> 02:53:36.20
Well, thank you.

2374
02:53:36.20 --> 02:53:38.64
Thank you for that.

2375
02:53:38.64 --> 02:53:39.64
And I am.

2376
02:53:39.64 --> 02:53:41.88
So those okay's right back at you.

2377
02:53:41.88 --> 02:53:47.32
You're one of my heroes.

2378
02:53:47.32 --> 02:53:53.32
I don't accept sir, not at all.

2379
02:53:53.32 --> 02:53:59.48
As you look at other people's struggle, with all the things that you mentioned, the drugs,

2380
02:53:59.48 --> 02:54:08.52
the alcohol, the obsession, depression, after the loss of a loved one, how can people find

2381
02:54:08.52 --> 02:54:16.32
the faith, the discipline, the pride that you talk about?

2382
02:54:16.32 --> 02:54:22.12
What you think is that kernel that's starting point that allows those things to grow

2383
02:54:22.12 --> 02:54:28.64
in someone's mind so that they can overcome these kind of challenges.

2384
02:54:28.64 --> 02:54:35.20
I think the first seed that you have to plant in nurture in your mind is that you still

2385
02:54:35.20 --> 02:54:40.08
have the choice that you still are in control.

2386
02:54:40.08 --> 02:54:44.40
Because I think so many people that get bogged down with these challenges we're talking

2387
02:54:44.40 --> 02:54:50.72
about assume that there's no way out that it's somebody else's problem or somebody else has

2388
02:54:50.72 --> 02:54:56.64
to affect their lives and they feel like they have no control over the outcome.

2389
02:54:56.64 --> 02:55:03.32
And so I think that's the beginning part of it is that each of us makes decisions every

2390
02:55:03.32 --> 02:55:06.32
day that control our destiny.

2391
02:55:06.32 --> 02:55:09.24
And it's truly not the things around us.

2392
02:55:09.24 --> 02:55:13.64
It's our approach to the things around us.

2393
02:55:13.64 --> 02:55:15.52
It's our definition of the things around us.

2394
02:55:15.52 --> 02:55:22.96
It's our willingness to accept a challenge and make choices about the things around us.

2395
02:55:22.96 --> 02:55:29.08
And so if you can nurture that, if you can believe that, yes, I have control of my life.

2396
02:55:29.08 --> 02:55:36.20
I am the master of my fate and the captain of my soul.

2397
02:55:36.20 --> 02:55:41.92
And if you can really believe that, then the rest is just a matter of the discipline it takes

2398
02:55:41.92 --> 02:55:44.40
to work through it.

2399
02:55:44.40 --> 02:55:47.64
It's an interesting, I was talking to your son, Alex.

2400
02:55:47.64 --> 02:55:54.16
We were talking about how as he was growing up and he was hearing your philosophy of life

2401
02:55:54.16 --> 02:55:55.88
in the world.

2402
02:55:55.88 --> 02:56:00.72
When he heard me on the podcast and he started saying, wait a second, I've heard this kind

2403
02:56:00.72 --> 02:56:02.84
of stuff before.

2404
02:56:02.84 --> 02:56:09.88
And we were talking about how I've kind of said that now that there's some, I hate to

2405
02:56:09.88 --> 02:56:16.04
go so far as to say universal truths, but there's certainly some things in human nature

2406
02:56:16.04 --> 02:56:19.40
and human life that are very similar across the board.

2407
02:56:19.40 --> 02:56:26.48
And when you take people and you put them through this crazy thing of life and you provide

2408
02:56:26.48 --> 02:56:31.12
them with some similar challenges, they're going to come to very similar conclusions.

2409
02:56:31.12 --> 02:56:36.88
And from what you just said, there's two things that you said that I say all the time.

2410
02:56:36.88 --> 02:56:42.24
And number one, this perspective of, what's that initial spark to say, hey, I can take

2411
02:56:42.24 --> 02:56:45.96
this one, I can take the first thing in my mind, you've got to say, it's like, okay, these

2412
02:56:45.96 --> 02:56:49.36
problems that are happening, I can take ownership of what I can do, I can take ownership

2413
02:56:49.36 --> 02:56:50.36
of my problems.

2414
02:56:50.36 --> 02:56:55.44
I can't blame this guy, I can't blame that guy, I gotta take ownership of them.

2415
02:56:55.44 --> 02:56:57.08
And that's the first thing.

2416
02:56:57.08 --> 02:57:01.16
And then the other piece that you said that I say all the time is you've got decisions

2417
02:57:01.16 --> 02:57:02.16
to make.

2418
02:57:02.16 --> 02:57:07.92
You've got little decisions to make and if you can make that right decision, if you can

2419
02:57:07.92 --> 02:57:12.40
do the right thing at that moment in time, it's not going to change your life, that one

2420
02:57:12.40 --> 02:57:16.12
decision won't change your life, but then you're going to three minutes later, 30 seconds

2421
02:57:16.12 --> 02:57:18.88
later, and now we're later going to make another decision.

2422
02:57:18.88 --> 02:57:22.28
And can you hold the line and get yourself pointed in the right direction and can you have

2423
02:57:22.28 --> 02:57:23.88
the discipline to do that?

2424
02:57:23.88 --> 02:57:26.80
Can you have the faith in yourself that you're going to make that happen?

2425
02:57:26.80 --> 02:57:28.28
And can you have the pride?

2426
02:57:28.28 --> 02:57:33.12
And you know what, Dick Winner's talked about that too on the Lost Padcast, Dick Winner's

2427
02:57:33.12 --> 02:57:36.04
from the first to five or six band of brothers.

2428
02:57:36.04 --> 02:57:41.84
But one of the big things that he was concerned about with his men was if he saw them

2429
02:57:41.84 --> 02:57:44.60
begin to lose pride.

2430
02:57:44.60 --> 02:57:47.88
And how, hey, if I don't care what Eccle thinks of me, if I come in here, I'm not ready

2431
02:57:47.88 --> 02:57:50.76
for this podcast and he's going to look at me like, oh, I guess Jocca was just letting

2432
02:57:50.76 --> 02:57:51.76
it slide.

2433
02:57:51.76 --> 02:57:53.48
And all of a sudden, if I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore.

2434
02:57:53.48 --> 02:57:54.48
Now I'm not preparing.

2435
02:57:54.48 --> 02:57:56.04
Now I'm not getting ready.

2436
02:57:56.04 --> 02:57:58.88
And then you take someone in combat and they start to lose pride.

2437
02:57:58.88 --> 02:58:03.48
And Elvis and they say, I don't care who sees me acting the wrong way, who sees me

2438
02:58:03.48 --> 02:58:06.36
slacking off on a watch, who sees me not cleaning my weapon.

2439
02:58:06.36 --> 02:58:10.44
If I don't care about that anymore, that's the beginning of that downward spiral.

2440
02:58:10.44 --> 02:58:16.34
And pride is one of those things that you have to be careful of because just like any other

2441
02:58:16.34 --> 02:58:18.36
dichotomy that we have, it's human beings.

2442
02:58:18.36 --> 02:58:22.48
Yes, you can get so much pride that you no longer think you can do anything wrong.

2443
02:58:22.48 --> 02:58:24.56
And we know where that leads.

2444
02:58:24.56 --> 02:58:25.56
That's right.

2445
02:58:25.56 --> 02:58:30.56
And you can have not enough pride to keep yourself on the right path.

2446
02:58:30.56 --> 02:58:32.56
Amazing stuff.

2447
02:58:32.56 --> 02:58:41.56
Eko, did you have any questions?

2448
02:58:41.56 --> 02:58:42.56
Just wondering?

2449
02:58:42.56 --> 02:58:46.24
Yeah, well, this one part I kind of wanted to reflect on that.

2450
02:58:46.24 --> 02:58:50.000
I thought it was pretty important, even on a smaller.

2451
02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:56.48
Like the part where you're regarding the guards as in their own prison.

2452
02:58:56.48 --> 02:59:00.36
So you almost like you said that they had it worse than you did.

2453
02:59:00.36 --> 02:59:03.48
So this one time my wife told me to story with her.

2454
02:59:03.48 --> 02:59:06.12
She was in the checkout line, you know, in the store.

2455
02:59:06.12 --> 02:59:07.12
You got it.

2456
02:59:07.12 --> 02:59:08.60
A lot of stuff happens in the checkout line.

2457
02:59:08.60 --> 02:59:11.24
A lot of things happen when the grocery store is at the end of the trial.

2458
02:59:11.24 --> 02:59:13.20
A lot of lessons, a lot of lessons.

2459
02:59:13.20 --> 02:59:18.32
So she found herself in the express line, but she had more than the 15 items.

2460
02:59:18.32 --> 02:59:22.88
And the guy behind her started he was tripping the whole time.

2461
02:59:22.88 --> 02:59:24.44
So she's paying, she's trying to hurry up.

2462
02:59:24.44 --> 02:59:27.08
And he's like, you know what he's called.

2463
02:59:27.08 --> 02:59:33.44
I was talking to the person next to him about my wife.

2464
02:59:33.44 --> 02:59:37.28
So after the whole ordeal, it was kind of like a scene.

2465
02:59:37.28 --> 02:59:41.36
So my wife afterwards was like, oh, I hope you have a nice day.

2466
02:59:41.36 --> 02:59:43.32
Like a, you know, she left.

2467
02:59:43.32 --> 02:59:45.56
So did she say it earnestly?

2468
02:59:45.56 --> 02:59:46.56
Yes.

2469
02:59:46.56 --> 02:59:48.56
And I don't know.

2470
02:59:48.56 --> 02:59:49.56
I don't know.

2471
02:59:49.56 --> 02:59:50.56
I don't know.

2472
02:59:50.56 --> 02:59:51.56
I don't know.

2473
02:59:51.56 --> 02:59:54.72
Yeah, she was probably salty for sure, but at the end of the day, it's kind of like,

2474
02:59:54.72 --> 02:59:55.72
I hope you have a nice day.

2475
02:59:55.72 --> 02:59:58.32
And so she told me that certain she was like, but you know what?

2476
02:59:58.32 --> 03:00:01.24
A big part of me was like, he has to go home with himself.

2477
03:00:01.24 --> 03:00:05.88
You know, and I get to come home and be cool and have all my girl, you know, all this stuff.

2478
03:00:05.88 --> 03:00:07.52
He's like, dang, that's a good way to look at it.

2479
03:00:07.52 --> 03:00:08.52
Because he has to go home.

2480
03:00:08.52 --> 03:00:10.68
He's probably pissed for the day.

2481
03:00:10.68 --> 03:00:13.88
And you know, she gets to go home with 17 grocery items, too.

2482
03:00:13.88 --> 03:00:16.52
After I was in the big a checkout line.

2483
03:00:16.52 --> 03:00:17.52
It's amazing.

2484
03:00:17.52 --> 03:00:18.52
Right, too.

2485
03:00:18.52 --> 03:00:19.52
It's true.

2486
03:00:19.52 --> 03:00:20.52
Oh, yeah, one question.

2487
03:00:20.52 --> 03:00:22.52
You know, when you got arrested when you bought that scooter.

2488
03:00:22.52 --> 03:00:23.52
Right, the question.

2489
03:00:23.52 --> 03:00:24.52
Yeah, you figured about this for sure.

2490
03:00:24.52 --> 03:00:27.84
Because I've been in this experience because you get the scooter, you pack your

2491
03:00:27.84 --> 03:00:28.84
friend.

2492
03:00:28.84 --> 03:00:29.84
Yeah, right.

2493
03:00:29.84 --> 03:00:30.84
And then the cops, they stop you.

2494
03:00:30.84 --> 03:00:31.84
They've been to us all the time.

2495
03:00:31.84 --> 03:00:32.84
But why did they arrest you?

2496
03:00:32.84 --> 03:00:35.36
Those, I mean, is it like, hey, you guys can't do that.

2497
03:00:35.36 --> 03:00:37.36
You're going to jail.

2498
03:00:37.36 --> 03:00:39.72
Well, it was rather unusual.

2499
03:00:39.72 --> 03:00:44.64
I think for these, these cops to see these two little guys, you know, we were 13 and 14

2500
03:00:44.64 --> 03:00:45.64
years old.

2501
03:00:45.64 --> 03:00:46.64
Very big to begin with.

2502
03:00:46.64 --> 03:00:49.16
And the motorski, it was bigger than we were.

2503
03:00:49.16 --> 03:00:50.88
And it's in the middle of the night.

2504
03:00:50.88 --> 03:00:56.88
And we're, I think they felt, they felt like there was something suspicious.

2505
03:00:56.88 --> 03:00:57.88
Yeah, you took it.

2506
03:00:57.88 --> 03:00:58.88
You stole it.

2507
03:00:58.88 --> 03:00:59.88
Yeah.

2508
03:00:59.88 --> 03:01:03.92
Well, uh, all right, Echo, what?

2509
03:01:03.92 --> 03:01:06.16
Sir, do you have anything else on that on that right there?

2510
03:01:06.16 --> 03:01:07.16
No, okay.

2511
03:01:07.16 --> 03:01:10.56
No, no, no further details on the scooter rides.

2512
03:01:10.56 --> 03:01:11.56
No, no.

2513
03:01:11.56 --> 03:01:12.56
We got that clear.

2514
03:01:12.56 --> 03:01:14.56
Yeah, we got little, we got that.

2515
03:01:14.56 --> 03:01:15.56
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2516
03:01:15.56 --> 03:01:22.56
Echo, this, um, you know, do you think that you could maybe tell us how to support

2517
03:01:22.56 --> 03:01:23.56
the podcast?

2518
03:01:23.56 --> 03:01:24.56
Sure.

2519
03:01:24.56 --> 03:01:25.56
To court.

2520
03:01:25.56 --> 03:01:26.56
Of course I can't.

2521
03:01:26.56 --> 03:01:27.56
That's what I'm here for.

2522
03:01:27.56 --> 03:01:29.56
One of the many reasons.

2523
03:01:29.56 --> 03:01:31.84
So, um, if you want to support this podcast, many ways.

2524
03:01:31.84 --> 03:01:35.20
First way, you can support yourself.

2525
03:01:35.20 --> 03:01:37.84
I said it before I'm going to say it again on it.

2526
03:01:37.84 --> 03:01:38.84
Supplements, right?

2527
03:01:38.84 --> 03:01:41.08
You're doing physical stuff.

2528
03:01:41.08 --> 03:01:42.32
Supplements that get to you through.

2529
03:01:42.32 --> 03:01:43.60
I'm not going to spend too much time on it.

2530
03:01:43.60 --> 03:01:49.24
I want to, I want, I'm going to recommend the krill oil and the strunble.

2531
03:01:49.24 --> 03:01:50.24
That's it.

2532
03:01:50.24 --> 03:01:53.84
See, now just sir, I'm not letting this annoy me.

2533
03:01:53.84 --> 03:01:55.76
I'm just going to, I'm just like, okay with it.

2534
03:01:55.76 --> 03:01:56.76
It's my problem.

2535
03:01:56.76 --> 03:01:58.12
I don't want to listen to him talk.

2536
03:01:58.12 --> 03:01:59.12
That's my problem.

2537
03:01:59.12 --> 03:02:02.92
He has the right to speak for a long, you know, hours about, you know, this stuff.

2538
03:02:02.92 --> 03:02:03.92
But here's the thing.

2539
03:02:03.92 --> 03:02:06.52
The part, like, let's say you were to get annoyed.

2540
03:02:06.52 --> 03:02:10.36
The only reason you'd be annoyed, get annoyed is because you know this stuff.

2541
03:02:10.36 --> 03:02:11.36
Some people, they don't know.

2542
03:02:11.36 --> 03:02:12.36
There's all those people.

2543
03:02:12.36 --> 03:02:13.36
They're on a hearing.

2544
03:02:13.36 --> 03:02:14.60
You're on your everywhere.

2545
03:02:14.60 --> 03:02:17.52
But the good thing about on it, you know, that's a good stuff because supplements can be

2546
03:02:17.52 --> 03:02:19.32
kind of junk sometimes.

2547
03:02:19.32 --> 03:02:25.40
But this one, 100% these are good stuff and there's stuff for everything in life, everything.

2548
03:02:25.40 --> 03:02:27.96
We only talk about the krill oil.

2549
03:02:27.96 --> 03:02:28.96
Some other stuff.

2550
03:02:28.96 --> 03:02:33.96
But you go on there, protein, wellness, even like digest it, everything they got on there.

2551
03:02:33.96 --> 03:02:34.96
On it.

2552
03:02:34.96 --> 03:02:35.96
On it.

2553
03:02:35.96 --> 03:02:36.96
That's where you get it.

2554
03:02:36.96 --> 03:02:37.96
If you want 10% off on it.

2555
03:02:37.96 --> 03:02:38.96
On it.

2556
03:02:38.96 --> 03:02:42.92
Another way.

2557
03:02:42.92 --> 03:02:46.80
Before you do your Amazon shopping, click through jockelpodcast.com to do your Amazon

2558
03:02:46.80 --> 03:02:50.000
shopping and then, you know, do your shopping is normal.

2559
03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:54.24
It's a good way to support small action, big reaction, takes what, three seconds, something

2560
03:02:54.24 --> 03:02:55.24
like that.

2561
03:02:55.24 --> 03:02:56.24
Maybe four.

2562
03:02:56.24 --> 03:02:57.24
I don't know.

2563
03:02:57.24 --> 03:02:59.24
Either way, do that.

2564
03:02:59.24 --> 03:03:00.24
That's a good way.

2565
03:03:00.24 --> 03:03:03.04
Also, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.

2566
03:03:03.04 --> 03:03:08.64
That's iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, and other podcasting platforms.

2567
03:03:08.64 --> 03:03:09.64
Subscribe to YouTube.

2568
03:03:09.64 --> 03:03:10.64
Put some excerpts on there.

2569
03:03:10.64 --> 03:03:11.64
Watch them last one.

2570
03:03:11.64 --> 03:03:12.64
That was a good one.

2571
03:03:12.64 --> 03:03:13.64
Good one.

2572
03:03:13.64 --> 03:03:14.64
Two minutes.

2573
03:03:14.64 --> 03:03:18.64
You're just saying, you know, you're getting outside the boundaries.

2574
03:03:18.64 --> 03:03:19.64
I'm pushing it in the end of an excerpt.

2575
03:03:19.64 --> 03:03:20.64
Man, I'm listening to it.

2576
03:03:20.64 --> 03:03:22.64
I'm like, you don't want to eat your hours.

2577
03:03:22.64 --> 03:03:23.64
It's right there.

2578
03:03:23.64 --> 03:03:24.64
But I'm like, oh, wait, wait.

2579
03:03:24.64 --> 03:03:25.64
That kind of helped.

2580
03:03:25.64 --> 03:03:27.64
Was that like, what was it?

2581
03:03:27.64 --> 03:03:28.64
It's a good one.

2582
03:03:28.64 --> 03:03:29.64
It's 12 minutes long.

2583
03:03:29.64 --> 03:03:30.64
Emotion.

2584
03:03:30.64 --> 03:03:31.64
Oh, a hangry getting hangry.

2585
03:03:31.64 --> 03:03:33.64
Oh, getting a controlling your stifling your emotion.

2586
03:03:33.64 --> 03:03:35.64
That's why you need to be stifled your emotion.

2587
03:03:35.64 --> 03:03:36.64
Yeah, exactly.

2588
03:03:36.64 --> 03:03:38.64
That's one of our major meetings every month.

2589
03:03:38.64 --> 03:03:39.64
Right?

2590
03:03:39.64 --> 03:03:43.64
Yeah, you know, when it's level two or lower on the Richter scale of emotions, you can't behave

2591
03:03:43.64 --> 03:03:46.92
your emotions, your behavior can't be based on you know what?

2592
03:03:46.92 --> 03:03:49.88
Look at that little excerpt put more on the show.

2593
03:03:49.88 --> 03:03:51.88
Whatever, I don't know.

2594
03:03:51.88 --> 03:03:52.88
Stop it.

2595
03:03:52.88 --> 03:03:55.88
I don't want to juggle podcasts YouTube.

2596
03:03:55.88 --> 03:03:56.88
Subscribe to that.

2597
03:03:56.88 --> 03:03:57.88
That's what you do.

2598
03:03:57.88 --> 03:03:58.88
Yeah, you know, the jump.

2599
03:03:58.88 --> 03:03:59.88
Sounds like a channel.

2600
03:03:59.88 --> 03:04:00.88
YouTube too.

2601
03:04:00.88 --> 03:04:01.88
It's like just like a channel.

2602
03:04:01.88 --> 03:04:02.88
It's YouTube channel.

2603
03:04:02.88 --> 03:04:03.88
Dunno.

2604
03:04:03.88 --> 03:04:05.88
Anyone who knows what YouTube is going to know this.

2605
03:04:05.88 --> 03:04:06.72
It's all good, bro.

2606
03:04:06.72 --> 03:04:08.16
I think you're already subscribed.

2607
03:04:08.16 --> 03:04:09.28
You get the notification.

2608
03:04:09.28 --> 03:04:10.12
You're all good.

2609
03:04:10.12 --> 03:04:10.96
You're all good.

2610
03:04:10.96 --> 03:04:11.96
You're all good.

2611
03:04:11.96 --> 03:04:12.96
100%.

2612
03:04:12.96 --> 03:04:14.96
Also, Joc was a store.

2613
03:04:14.96 --> 03:04:17.000
It's called Jockel Store.

2614
03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:18.000
JockelStore.com.

2615
03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:19.20
There's some good stuff on there.

2616
03:04:19.20 --> 03:04:20.20
T-shirts.

2617
03:04:20.20 --> 03:04:22.000
If you like T-shirts, we wear T-shirts.

2618
03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.40
I know I do.

2619
03:04:24.40 --> 03:04:25.64
Some women stuff on there.

2620
03:04:25.64 --> 03:04:26.64
Shirts.

2621
03:04:26.64 --> 03:04:29.60
Patches, rashguards, hoodies.

2622
03:04:29.60 --> 03:04:30.92
New rashguards.

2623
03:04:30.92 --> 03:04:31.92
Out.

2624
03:04:31.92 --> 03:04:32.92
Oh, maybe.

2625
03:04:32.92 --> 03:04:34.24
Maybe, maybe not.

2626
03:04:34.24 --> 03:04:35.24
You got to look.

2627
03:04:35.24 --> 03:04:36.24
Get some good stuff.

2628
03:04:36.24 --> 03:04:38.68
We got some kids stuff too on there.

2629
03:04:38.68 --> 03:04:39.68
Yeah, that's right.

2630
03:04:39.68 --> 03:04:40.68
You're wearing one of those.

2631
03:04:40.68 --> 03:04:41.68
Some more.

2632
03:04:41.68 --> 03:04:42.68
You're tough.

2633
03:04:42.68 --> 03:04:43.68
That's right.

2634
03:04:43.68 --> 03:04:44.68
You're new to both.

2635
03:04:44.68 --> 03:04:47.36
Bunch people are hitting me up for war, your kid.

2636
03:04:47.36 --> 03:04:49.36
T-shirts.

2637
03:04:49.36 --> 03:04:54.36
And then immediately, people said, we want them for adults too.

2638
03:04:54.36 --> 03:04:55.36
So we made some for kids.

2639
03:04:55.36 --> 03:04:57.32
But then adults said, we want them.

2640
03:04:57.32 --> 03:04:58.68
So now we got war, your kids.

2641
03:04:58.68 --> 03:05:01.80
Because can you be a 45 year old warrior kid?

2642
03:05:01.80 --> 03:05:02.80
I think I am.

2643
03:05:02.80 --> 03:05:03.80
Sure.

2644
03:05:03.80 --> 03:05:04.80
I say, I'm in the game.

2645
03:05:04.80 --> 03:05:05.80
You're a kid.

2646
03:05:05.80 --> 03:05:06.80
Yeah.

2647
03:05:06.80 --> 03:05:09.28
And if you didn't, I mean, you're going to obviously talk about the work where the

2648
03:05:09.28 --> 03:05:10.28
work could book.

2649
03:05:10.28 --> 03:05:14.16
But man, when you read that book, you're like, dang, I wish I would have read this

2650
03:05:14.16 --> 03:05:15.16
whether it be when I'm a kid.

2651
03:05:15.16 --> 03:05:18.40
I wish I would have read it one day before I read it that day.

2652
03:05:18.40 --> 03:05:20.76
That's how much you wish you would have known all this stuff.

2653
03:05:20.76 --> 03:05:22.40
Because it's a real basic.

2654
03:05:22.40 --> 03:05:23.76
That's so deep, man.

2655
03:05:23.76 --> 03:05:24.76
Uncle Jake's got some info.

2656
03:05:24.76 --> 03:05:25.76
Layers, man.

2657
03:05:25.76 --> 03:05:26.76
Layers upon layers.

2658
03:05:26.76 --> 03:05:27.76
Yeah.

2659
03:05:27.76 --> 03:05:30.96
There's people now identifying layers onto it or by the way, which is a pre- there's

2660
03:05:30.96 --> 03:05:34.08
been some really good identification of layers.

2661
03:05:34.08 --> 03:05:35.08
There's some layers in that book.

2662
03:05:35.08 --> 03:05:36.08
Yep.

2663
03:05:36.08 --> 03:05:36.08
Yeah.

2664
03:05:36.08 --> 03:05:37.08
They're going to get deeper too.

2665
03:05:37.08 --> 03:05:38.08
Yeah, man.

2666
03:05:38.08 --> 03:05:39.08
It's good.

2667
03:05:39.08 --> 03:05:40.08
So yeah.

2668
03:05:40.08 --> 03:05:41.08
Back to the story, Jockels start out coming.

2669
03:05:41.08 --> 03:05:43.08
You can see what's on there.

2670
03:05:43.08 --> 03:05:44.08
It's cool stuff.

2671
03:05:44.08 --> 03:05:47.08
And if you want to support, get something.

2672
03:05:47.08 --> 03:05:48.08
Also, psychological warfare.

2673
03:05:48.08 --> 03:05:50.48
You can know what that is, which I know you already do.

2674
03:05:50.48 --> 03:05:53.08
But it is in the small event that you don't.

2675
03:05:53.08 --> 03:05:57.52
It is in Album on iTunes with tracks.

2676
03:05:57.52 --> 03:06:01.08
And Amazon Music with tracks.

2677
03:06:01.08 --> 03:06:03.08
Not music tracks.

2678
03:06:03.08 --> 03:06:04.08
Spoken word tracks.

2679
03:06:04.08 --> 03:06:06.08
Technically, it's what's called Spoken word.

2680
03:06:06.08 --> 03:06:08.08
Number one, by the way.

2681
03:06:08.08 --> 03:06:09.08
Yeah.

2682
03:06:09.08 --> 03:06:10.08
Still.

2683
03:06:10.08 --> 03:06:11.08
Number one.

2684
03:06:11.08 --> 03:06:12.08
That's the only thing.

2685
03:06:12.08 --> 03:06:15.16
That I mean, for good reason, because look, I think you put together psychological

2686
03:06:15.16 --> 03:06:16.16
warfare too.

2687
03:06:16.16 --> 03:06:21.16
And I got some really good suggestions from everyone on things that need where we need help

2688
03:06:21.16 --> 03:06:22.16
groups.

2689
03:06:22.16 --> 03:06:29.16
So if you got those, hit us up on Twitter to give suggestions for psychological warfare

2690
03:06:29.16 --> 03:06:33.80
to tracks what you need, areas where we need help.

2691
03:06:33.80 --> 03:06:34.80
We all need help.

2692
03:06:34.80 --> 03:06:35.80
Yeah.

2693
03:06:35.80 --> 03:06:39.16
I got some some some, you give me 47 requests.

2694
03:06:39.16 --> 03:06:41.16
Yeah, they're on my personal.

2695
03:06:41.16 --> 03:06:42.16
Yeah.

2696
03:06:42.16 --> 03:06:44.16
I think I got 48 now.

2697
03:06:44.16 --> 03:06:46.20
But yeah, if you didn't know what that is, it's like, it's Album.

2698
03:06:46.20 --> 03:06:47.20
You get it.

2699
03:06:47.20 --> 03:06:51.04
You have, you know, in your journey of what, getting after it, in your getting after

2700
03:06:51.04 --> 03:06:54.80
it journey, but you, you're not strong the whole time.

2701
03:06:54.80 --> 03:06:55.80
You're just not.

2702
03:06:55.80 --> 03:06:56.80
Yeah, at moment.

2703
03:06:56.80 --> 03:06:58.24
Most of a sudden, you're going to have moments of weakness.

2704
03:06:58.24 --> 03:07:03.68
But guess what, in those moments of weakness, you listen to the designated track.

2705
03:07:03.68 --> 03:07:07.68
If you're having a weak moment of weakness when you're trying to wake up at 430, remember

2706
03:07:07.68 --> 03:07:10.48
that's early, 430 every day.

2707
03:07:10.48 --> 03:07:11.48
Yeah.

2708
03:07:11.48 --> 03:07:14.56
The day is probably going to come where you're like, you know what I'm going to hit this

2709
03:07:14.56 --> 03:07:15.56
news.

2710
03:07:15.56 --> 03:07:16.56
Guess what?

2711
03:07:16.56 --> 03:07:19.08
Listen to get up and get after it.

2712
03:07:19.08 --> 03:07:20.56
There's like two or three of those two.

2713
03:07:20.56 --> 03:07:22.24
And I guarantee you won't hit this news.

2714
03:07:22.24 --> 03:07:23.24
You'll get up.

2715
03:07:23.24 --> 03:07:24.56
You'll get after it anyway.

2716
03:07:24.56 --> 03:07:27.04
That's, that's what I think with 100% certainty.

2717
03:07:27.04 --> 03:07:30.96
Anyway, again, it's called Psychological Worcester, Son iTunes, and Amazon Music.

2718
03:07:30.96 --> 03:07:37.04
And some other places where you buy into a music, they're all up in there.

2719
03:07:37.04 --> 03:07:38.04
Yeah.

2720
03:07:38.04 --> 03:07:39.04
Good.

2721
03:07:39.04 --> 03:07:45.52
And also, by the way, the book that we reviewed today with Captain Plum, it's available

2722
03:07:45.52 --> 03:07:54.32
on CharliePlum.com, CH-A-R-L-I-E-P-L-U-M-B.com.

2723
03:07:54.32 --> 03:07:55.32
That's where you can get it.

2724
03:07:55.32 --> 03:07:56.32
It's called I'm No Hero.

2725
03:07:56.32 --> 03:08:03.12
And also, you can get some Jocquite T on there.

2726
03:08:03.12 --> 03:08:07.64
If you need to drink liquid in your life, you might as well drink a liquid that's going

2727
03:08:07.64 --> 03:08:12.68
to make you smarter, stronger, faster, and a more dynamic human being.

2728
03:08:12.68 --> 03:08:15.92
There's only one drink that does that, and that's Jocquite T.

2729
03:08:15.92 --> 03:08:21.92
By the way, it's 147% double blind possible proved and treated in a laboratory with people

2730
03:08:21.92 --> 03:08:24.000
wearing white outfits.

2731
03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.60
So you know we're good to go.

2732
03:08:26.60 --> 03:08:28.04
Way to work, you're kidding?

2733
03:08:28.04 --> 03:08:33.16
And this is the book right there that's going to hit your kids from another angle.

2734
03:08:33.16 --> 03:08:40.40
And it's going to get them to understand some things like hard work, discipline, honor,

2735
03:08:40.40 --> 03:08:43.96
physical training, mental training, studying.

2736
03:08:43.96 --> 03:08:46.56
No one think Jocquite was going to write a book of Teach Peel Hall of Study.

2737
03:08:46.56 --> 03:08:47.80
They didn't think that did that, though.

2738
03:08:47.80 --> 03:08:48.80
Tom of the truth.

2739
03:08:48.80 --> 03:08:49.80
They didn't think that?

2740
03:08:49.80 --> 03:08:50.80
No.

2741
03:08:50.80 --> 03:08:51.80
They didn't see my college grades.

2742
03:08:51.80 --> 03:08:52.80
They didn't.

2743
03:08:52.80 --> 03:08:56.84
So you learn how to study, you learn how to get stronger in the book.

2744
03:08:56.84 --> 03:08:59.12
Where the war your kid, get it for your kids.

2745
03:08:59.12 --> 03:09:01.44
And you know what, you're going to read it first.

2746
03:09:01.44 --> 03:09:03.28
And then you're going to get a copy for yourself.

2747
03:09:03.28 --> 03:09:04.92
Where the war your kid, get that.

2748
03:09:04.92 --> 03:09:06.92
Can I say something about one say some part?

2749
03:09:06.92 --> 03:09:07.92
Yeah, sure.

2750
03:09:07.92 --> 03:09:11.12
We have another four hours of space on the corridor.

2751
03:09:11.12 --> 03:09:12.12
So that's the way.

2752
03:09:12.12 --> 03:09:15.92
There's a part when he sees small progress.

2753
03:09:15.92 --> 03:09:17.88
I think he's after one pull up.

2754
03:09:17.88 --> 03:09:19.24
And he's like, yeah.

2755
03:09:19.24 --> 03:09:20.24
Oh yeah.

2756
03:09:20.24 --> 03:09:24.12
He's cleared up.

2757
03:09:24.12 --> 03:09:28.36
The part when he said he scolded him small mild scolding for celebrating to early or too much to early.

2758
03:09:28.36 --> 03:09:30.36
Jake says, hey, take it easy then.

2759
03:09:30.36 --> 03:09:31.36
Yeah, good.

2760
03:09:31.36 --> 03:09:36.04
But then he said, come over here, give me a high five and get back to work.

2761
03:09:36.04 --> 03:09:37.64
We let him celebrate a little bit.

2762
03:09:37.64 --> 03:09:38.64
That's good man.

2763
03:09:38.64 --> 03:09:40.64
That's a good uncle Jake is a good man.

2764
03:09:40.64 --> 03:09:41.64
Yes.

2765
03:09:41.64 --> 03:09:42.64
Good man.

2766
03:09:42.64 --> 03:09:43.64
He puts it out to it.

2767
03:09:43.64 --> 03:09:44.64
Right.

2768
03:09:44.64 --> 03:09:45.64
Also, you can pre-order the book.

2769
03:09:45.64 --> 03:09:49.04
This funny cool freedom field manual.

2770
03:09:49.04 --> 03:09:54.64
Which explains to you how to get after it.

2771
03:09:54.64 --> 03:09:57.92
So get after it in order to the book.

2772
03:09:57.92 --> 03:09:59.96
Of course, extreme ownership.

2773
03:09:59.96 --> 03:10:05.12
This is for your leadership principles tested, testing combat, testing the business world.

2774
03:10:05.12 --> 03:10:11.28
They're there for you to read, learn, lead, win.

2775
03:10:11.28 --> 03:10:16.04
And if you need more than that from the book, if you need more than the book in the

2776
03:10:16.04 --> 03:10:19.000
podcast or for your business or your team, echelon front.

2777
03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:29.56
You can email at info on echelon front.com, leadership and management, consulting, training.

2778
03:10:29.56 --> 03:10:39.76
Also, the muster number three, Austin, Texas, July 13th and 14th, I'm the Barton Creek

2779
03:10:39.76 --> 03:10:40.76
Resort.

2780
03:10:40.76 --> 03:10:42.000
I'm not going to say Spawnymore.

2781
03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:43.000
Not going to the spot.

2782
03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.68
No, I'm going to have that evening shut down while we're there.

2783
03:10:45.68 --> 03:10:47.60
Good to be no spot going on.

2784
03:10:47.60 --> 03:10:53.44
So come down, July 13th and 14th, join us in the pursuit of world domination.

2785
03:10:53.44 --> 03:10:54.96
That's the goal.

2786
03:10:54.96 --> 03:10:59.48
And if you can't make Texas, you can come to San Diego, September 14th and 15th, back

2787
03:10:59.48 --> 03:11:05.16
in SD for number four.

2788
03:11:05.16 --> 03:11:09.28
And in the meantime, while you're waiting for that, if you have questions or comments

2789
03:11:09.28 --> 03:11:14.16
for us, you can get us on the interwebs.

2790
03:11:14.16 --> 03:11:21.80
Now first of all, speaking of millennials, Captain Plum Sir, you are all up in the technology

2791
03:11:21.80 --> 03:11:22.80
here.

2792
03:11:22.80 --> 03:11:28.44
Well, you are on Twitter, at Captain Plum, right?

2793
03:11:28.44 --> 03:11:31.92
Facebook, Facebook, what's that at?

2794
03:11:31.92 --> 03:11:34.40
LinkedIn, yeah, same thing.

2795
03:11:34.40 --> 03:11:35.56
Captain Plum.

2796
03:11:35.56 --> 03:11:38.48
Just a social media junkie is what I'm hearing.

2797
03:11:38.48 --> 03:11:42.24
My kids keep me honest.

2798
03:11:42.24 --> 03:11:48.04
And you also, you mentioned quickly while we were talking that you do speaking engagements

2799
03:11:48.04 --> 03:11:49.04
and all that.

2800
03:11:49.04 --> 03:11:54.48
Where's the best place to contact you for those type of events or consulting?

2801
03:11:54.48 --> 03:11:56.64
All on my website, CharliePrem.com.

2802
03:11:56.64 --> 03:11:58.64
So it's all there.

2803
03:11:58.64 --> 03:11:59.64
Awesome.

2804
03:11:59.64 --> 03:12:02.76
So, and that's what we're making fun.

2805
03:12:02.76 --> 03:12:11.60
You as far as Echo and myself, we are also cruising on the interwebs.

2806
03:12:11.60 --> 03:12:17.20
On Instagram, on Twitter, Echo is at Echo Charles.

2807
03:12:17.20 --> 03:12:21.88
I am at Jocca Willink and we are also in the Facebook.

2808
03:12:21.88 --> 03:12:23.76
So you can check that one as well.

2809
03:12:23.76 --> 03:12:27.20
Echo, you got anything else for us today?

2810
03:12:27.20 --> 03:12:29.36
I don't think you so much.

2811
03:12:29.36 --> 03:12:30.36
Damn, Charlie.

2812
03:12:30.36 --> 03:12:32.56
And on there.

2813
03:12:32.56 --> 03:12:36.24
And Sir, do you have anything any other closing thoughts you want to add?

2814
03:12:36.24 --> 03:12:40.56
Well, I want to tell you about the rest of the story.

2815
03:12:40.56 --> 03:12:46.000
Since people might be interested in knowing that my ex-wife married the guy she was engaged

2816
03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:51.76
to and they've been living happily for the last 43 years.

2817
03:12:51.76 --> 03:12:57.40
I remarry to wonderful lady at four kids, two grandkids, and one on the way.

2818
03:12:57.40 --> 03:13:00.80
My daughter is married to a marine and they're pregnant with her first child.

2819
03:13:00.80 --> 03:13:02.60
She would be doing, in fact, any day now.

2820
03:13:02.60 --> 03:13:10.32
I'm a wonderful wife that supports me and it puts up with me.

2821
03:13:10.32 --> 03:13:13.000
And I'm living the dream.

2822
03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:14.000
I really am.

2823
03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.76
I don't know how I could be happier in my life.

2824
03:13:16.76 --> 03:13:23.84
I could not write a story that would bring more fulfillment to me personally than why I already

2825
03:13:23.84 --> 03:13:24.84
live.

2826
03:13:24.84 --> 03:13:26.32
I still fly airplanes.

2827
03:13:26.32 --> 03:13:27.48
I have two airplanes.

2828
03:13:27.48 --> 03:13:31.80
I have a home in a hanger as well, my man gave.

2829
03:13:31.80 --> 03:13:35.44
And it's just, it's a delight to be alive.

2830
03:13:35.44 --> 03:13:39.20
And I appreciate you for helping me tell my story.

2831
03:13:39.20 --> 03:13:42.04
Because I believe it's an important story.

2832
03:13:42.04 --> 03:13:45.68
Now, not everybody is going to be a prisoner of war.

2833
03:13:45.68 --> 03:13:51.28
In fact, I hope it's not the people listening to this podcast, whatever, be in that

2834
03:13:51.28 --> 03:13:52.92
eight-foot cell.

2835
03:13:52.92 --> 03:13:53.92
But I was in.

2836
03:13:53.92 --> 03:13:56.68
But we all get into our own little prisons.

2837
03:13:56.68 --> 03:14:02.68
And we can be, I am convinced, just as confined in our little eight-inch box as I was

2838
03:14:02.68 --> 03:14:05.24
in an eight-foot prison cell.

2839
03:14:05.24 --> 03:14:12.76
And so if those challenges are the same, then the solution is the same.

2840
03:14:12.76 --> 03:14:16.40
The solution to the prisons that we find ourselves in.

2841
03:14:16.40 --> 03:14:22.96
The self-discipline that it takes, the believing that, yes, I am a control of my own life.

2842
03:14:22.96 --> 03:14:27.64
I am a captain of my soul.

2843
03:14:27.64 --> 03:14:30.44
And that I do make a difference.

2844
03:14:30.44 --> 03:14:36.92
So you put all those things together and you can, in fact, live the life with the hand

2845
03:14:36.92 --> 03:14:37.92
that you're dealt.

2846
03:14:37.92 --> 03:14:47.24
I won't even try and make any additional points on that other than to say, when you have

2847
03:14:47.24 --> 03:14:52.80
a hanger with two planes in it for your man cave, you win the man cave contest.

2848
03:14:52.80 --> 03:14:53.80
Absolutely.

2849
03:14:53.80 --> 03:14:56.44
That's unbelievable.

2850
03:14:56.44 --> 03:15:02.96
And, sir, obviously, I can't thank you enough for coming on the podcast for writing

2851
03:15:02.96 --> 03:15:12.20
the book for sharing the knowledge that you paid so dearly to acquire.

2852
03:15:12.20 --> 03:15:14.36
And more important than all that.

2853
03:15:14.36 --> 03:15:25.44
I can't thank you enough for your service and your sacrifice for six years for us.

2854
03:15:25.44 --> 03:15:28.96
And for this great nation.

2855
03:15:28.96 --> 03:15:40.96
And you dedicate your book very simply to the families of those brave men who will never

2856
03:15:40.96 --> 03:15:44.36
return.

2857
03:15:44.36 --> 03:15:47.64
And for those families.

2858
03:15:47.64 --> 03:15:55.12
And for those brave men, we will live.

2859
03:15:55.12 --> 03:16:09.76
And we will try to live as you have exemplified with faith and pride and discipline.

2860
03:16:09.76 --> 03:16:16.60
To overcome whatever hardships we might face and whatever obstacles might be in our

2861
03:16:16.60 --> 03:16:32.76
path and through those adversities, discover every day.

2862
03:16:32.76 --> 03:16:39.88
How to love this life.

2863
03:16:39.88 --> 03:16:49.32
So until next time, this is Captain Charlie Plum, Aneko and Jocco.

2864
03:16:49.32 --> 03:17:10.12
Oh.
