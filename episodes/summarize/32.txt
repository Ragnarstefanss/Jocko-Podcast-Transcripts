You know you're instructors you know recognize you as a black belt you are a black belt regardless and just because you jump back on the wave of jujitsu and maybe weren't as good as surfing you know you're still you're still that black belt you just got it like I said you just got to get refresh with all the new techniques if you want to you know be up to. And you know some of the stereotypes that that you might see out there Like like like like for instance men or tougher than women or men or women or women are more emotional than men That's just garbage and if you see I've seen At least when you get to a leadership position I've definitely seen women that were way tougher than then guys were in terms of hey we got to make this move for the company Here's what I'm gonna do boom they executed and I've seen men that were way too emotional and attached to Is this scenario and ruin it because they're just the way more emotional than the stereotypical woman might be so that's why I just didn't think you can trust them I look at a person I weathered a man or woman. I feel that all the time Just gotta like fight your tongue Right, but I think that's that's a real compelling like desire, you know to To show hey, already know that or look how much I know you know I make a What he does really well is he makes people talk and he you know I've heard him get some criticism for You know, let's say he's got like a Religious guy on there and he doesn't believe in religion But he'll let that person talk about religion and won't like jump on him and get in their face and say you know I think that your way of training should be Done or performed with kids as well like parents with their kids you know how you because you know how the Kid the kids miss behaving and the parents like I don't know why he does that I told him not to pitch a fit But you know what I remember when I sit long time ago where I was like, yeah, you know, I don't know No, I don't mind oh, you don't like boss. and we're gonna move on Yeah, that that showing off knowledge thing that that that it's in a micromanagement situation It seems like okay, it's obviously shouldn't do that and you can probably see it from a malo But but just in everyday life, that's a compelling thing to want to show people you ever Ever hear someone telling you something that you already know and you just want to tell them I already know I don't think there's anything false about saying hey I am not good enough to be a black belt right now so therefore I'm putting on I think I'm about purple belt level I know it feels like to be a black belt and I don't feel like one right now and he gets her in a choke he gets her in a rear naked choke and she berries her chin like a white belt like a like a defense you know I'm very much in so he's not going to talk me he chokes her face like I'm talking legit gets after it. But like is that is that like you know as far as like can you do that or what I do how do you feel about that I don't know but that would be very cool to see that happen. and it it does seem like a real like personal like deeply personal thing like because it it's like it's more and I'm like like I got that 60 hours 60 hours worth of worth of Conversation with you and me and so absolutely people start feeling like You know, hey, oh, So just take one of those hours yeah or take maybe 10% of that money that you're spending or 25% all of it Whatever and put it in something that you anticipate in the other thing is I mean Investing yourself is like actually build something actually build a little company You know make something that's what that that's what I was meant you've got another perspective Which is also very viable and makes just as much sense I was literally talking about you know From your perspective. so That's what you're gonna do you want to you want to get your money taken care of you want to you want to have financial freedom You got to just have the financial discipline that's that's all there is to it and work hard You know or card make things happen, but your your major gains You know most people don't become rich by their salary I mean people can fall in and out of that mindset in that trap you know where it's like I just want that that belt I want to walk around and be known as a black belt or whatever and then that mindset starts to just creep in their mind and it becomes like a major part of their thinking. It's not like a profession for him, but it should be he should be it's it's a great podcast So check out Margar made it's also a he's on Twitter Under Margar made is his is his call sign, but he's got like 142 followers like no one knows no one knows about him and actually you know what it was somebody on Twitter but like I said if there was a job that you had to do basically it's like if you have a job to do as a brown belt you have to represent you know like in a company or something you can be the director of sales. Yeah, you throw it thinking back like thinking back five years ago You Spend all your money not all your money, but you said a bunch of money on drinks and what I get Literally nothing to show for it and in most cases you get there's it's gonna mess you up in one way Yeah, you can do something you regret or whatever potentially So think of that same five years and be like dang I've done it before and then Jocco store dot com that's where if you if you like you know shirts in a peril in regards to this podcast is good some good ones I think Speaking of which if you didn't already know we have the trooper one just kind of new it's the new stuff I think I think more demotions need to happen like oh you haven't been coming to the gym for two years cool get give me a round belt you know the link they man's sorry you know. and it's a great podcast and Those are the and and you know what I'm a really picky podcast guy too like I'm really I need somebody to get I need somebody needs to bring it on their podcast for me to like it I try all I try new podcast all the time They're gonna realize that you know they're gonna know that you know that you trained them When they when you reflect on the same information and do to again Yeah, rage rage against the dying of the light and with that the You know this kind of balanced all things don't kick you know guys will just be redlining their workout Because they're trying to maintain that no, no, you know you can't you gotta be careful about that like I said I like to hit I like to hit play on a podcast and be like and If you spent that hour and Really you could kind of keep watching out if you want but just spend that one hour doing something that you anticipate If you're really good at it would help you financially Do that thing for one hour and then I like it one day is gonna come you're gonna think back Oh, just the same way I'm thinking back a little five years ago. You know why you know why did that because I have to maintain that attitude of like Like I'm not doing this I'm doing this because I want to do it But I said, you know, it's one thing that we got to remember is what it's like for maybe some people you know when I was growing up, I had to deal with this. I want to invest money in things that I know I understand what better do I know and understand than than things that I'm doing for people that I know or things that I'm involved with I go through a highlight the whole thing of what I think is impactful What I think is important But then once you read it you can't just it does doesn't It you just don't pick it up and read the highlighted parts in order because that doesn't always make sense And it also doesn't always have the it doesn't make People think doesn't make me think about what I want to think about doesn't have the impact that I want it to have So once I have it highlighted then I have to go through and plus all highlight You know, let's say a highlight half the book It's interesting too because you made that video and you made another video Where does discipline come from and I actually first thing I like the weirdest discipline come from video better But the good video it just strikes court with people right the act because I think I think because it applies so universally to negativity in the world like Yeah, so that time when I went up I asked him hey, do you Encounter people who basically feel like they know you like personally? You know it wasn't like you said oh look at him he doesn't know I don't respect him no you're actually actually the opposite is true you'd say oh man props props to the boss here for coming out and getting after it with the boys for a day. And so by that's all said and done you know you're talking about 20 hours 15 to 20 hours to prep and Everything we like today or yesterday I got done prepping for this podcast or actually I got done prepping for the the four hours in my life As soon as I got done I literally picked it up. And I think this kind of helps you know how, let's say like, let's say you're in a boat, right, like a row boat. yeah, you know, I just it's just great when you can when you can just sit down and listen That's always what I've said for for for this podcast Like I want it to be something where people sit down and kind of put their headphones on and say okay I'm getting ready to press press play three two One here it comes and I think sometimes you'll go into things that doesn't apply to everyone's common knowledge You know, maybe only military guys will know it or all the exact same I know it I'd rather so many different dynamics to every kids experience so you know how and this is how the conversation kind of if I remember correctly Kind of started when you were like hey, I have you know four kids or whatever and I try and maintain the daily discipline and all things That's what I try and do because when you start cutting those corners is when I think it adds up over 15 years and you wake up And you're not the person that you Remember that you were and you're not the person you want to be So You got to maintain and hold that line as long as you can and I'm always actually trying to do new things too like trying to figure out Something else that's new some other technique I've never done before some exercise I haven't got a by some weird piece of exercise gear because I'll see something cool on the interwebs and other Old-day hang out. That's one of the kind of cool things about no key in the idea that and everyone gives belts now with no key I mean Dean gives belts with no key I mean I support giving belts with no key even though guide never wears a key and he doesn't need a belt but you know I say all this guy's a black belt but one thing that is cool about no key and kind of especially during the during the rogue years of no key where it wasn't a thing
