00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.40
This is Jocopontcast number 202 with echo Charles and me, a jocowilling. Good evening. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.52 --> 00:00:18.000
On a bright and violent morning in the central Pacific, a dying marine with part of his face shot off

3
00:00:18.84 --> 00:00:20.84
saved my life.

4
00:00:20.84 --> 00:00:21.84
He was

5
00:00:21.84 --> 00:00:30.84
purged to top the partially raised ramp of an LCVP. He was a big solidly built man with a gaping

6
00:00:30.84 --> 00:00:37.64
gory hole where his eye should have been. Blood streaming from the wound.

7
00:00:37.64 --> 00:00:42.28
Moments earlier, he had been standing in the water beside me at the bottom of the ramp,

8
00:00:42.28 --> 00:00:48.56
waiting with the other wounded men for his turn to board. Another casualty in the battle for

9
00:00:48.56 --> 00:00:57.76
Bayes, you island. I was dying. I'd been shot through the lower abdomen, hit as my unit

10
00:00:57.76 --> 00:01:04.04
waited toward the shore to assault the island. Two men from my platoon hauled me back to the

11
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:11.24
LCVP and struggled to lift me into the boat. The marine with the ravaged face who had just

12
00:01:11.24 --> 00:01:17.44
boarded. Now saw that they were having trouble with me. He reached down, grabbed me with

13
00:01:17.44 --> 00:01:31.52
one hand and pulled me up and over the top of the ramp. Amazing. And so I didn't die. That too was

14
00:01:31.52 --> 00:01:40.80
amazing. But not really all that significant in the grand scheme of things. That incident

15
00:01:40.80 --> 00:01:53.92
is just a small scene in a very big picture. So an insignificant event like that. Can you

16
00:01:53.92 --> 00:02:02.52
imagine being gut shot in waste deep water under heavy machine gunfire, barely making it

17
00:02:02.52 --> 00:02:07.64
back to a landing craft, which is going to save you, being pulled into that landing craft by

18
00:02:07.64 --> 00:02:17.96
another wounded marine and surviving? Can you imagine considering that series of events to be

19
00:02:17.96 --> 00:02:27.40
insignificant? It's almost impossible to think that way. But that excerpt is from a book called

20
00:02:27.40 --> 00:02:35.40
Faithful Warriors, written by Lieutenant Colonel Dean Ladd, who served as an enlisted

21
00:02:35.40 --> 00:02:42.52
an officer in the Marine Corps in the Pacific Campaign in World War II. He participated

22
00:02:42.52 --> 00:02:50.92
in the battles for Guadalcanal, Taroa, Sipan, and Tinian. Battles where tens of thousands

23
00:02:50.92 --> 00:02:57.32
of Americans were wounded or killed as they fought against the fanatical Japanese imperial

24
00:02:57.32 --> 00:03:06.92
war machine. And while it's impossible for us to understand what those men actually went through

25
00:03:06.92 --> 00:03:14.76
and what those battles were like. This book does an amazing job of giving us a glimpse into

26
00:03:14.76 --> 00:03:27.64
this savage part of war. And it is a complete honor to have the author of this book, Dean Ladd,

27
00:03:27.64 --> 00:03:35.32
here to talk with us about his experiences. Colonel Ladd, welcome to the program. Thank you.

28
00:03:36.12 --> 00:03:44.20
That's incredible. The things that you went through in this book has been, I could not put this

29
00:03:44.20 --> 00:03:51.08
book down. And this book is just the picture that it paints of what you all went through in that

30
00:03:51.08 --> 00:03:58.92
Pacific Campaign is it's unbelievable what you guys went through. It truly is.

31
00:04:01.96 --> 00:04:09.000
So I guess if we're going to start, I always like to start. I always like to start at the start.

32
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.52
So for you, go into the book here. It says in early 1939, a boy from the next block came home

33
00:04:16.52 --> 00:04:21.64
from overseas. And I was never the same become because of it. His name was Lee Preston.

34
00:04:22.36 --> 00:04:26.76
And he was a corporal on leave from the Marine Corps. He showed up wearing his dress blues,

35
00:04:26.76 --> 00:04:32.92
creating quite a stern or quiet, spoken neighborhood. Mostly I think the stir was in me. He

36
00:04:32.92 --> 00:04:39.24
looks so sharp in that uniform and his manner the way he carried himself at once modest,

37
00:04:39.24 --> 00:04:45.16
but utterly selfish. He got me thinking about myself and my future. I was only a couple years

38
00:04:45.16 --> 00:04:49.96
younger than Lee, but it didn't seem that way. I was a senior in high school just a teenager,

39
00:04:49.96 --> 00:04:56.84
still a kid and Lee, well, he was different now. He had changed. He had left home a boy and returned.

40
00:04:56.84 --> 00:05:05.48
I'm a Marine, a warrior. A man. So the old Marine Corps recruiting process of just sending

41
00:05:05.48 --> 00:05:09.32
Marines home on leave and their dress uniform worked on you, huh? It really did.

42
00:05:12.12 --> 00:05:15.56
Ed, what did you know about the Marine Corps at that point in time?

43
00:05:16.76 --> 00:05:23.24
I bring much. I was being approached by one of the old timers in the local Marine Corps

44
00:05:23.24 --> 00:05:31.08
reserved, organized and they were trying to get me to join. This was an opportunity to find a

45
00:05:31.08 --> 00:05:38.04
little bit from another source. What was going to be? What it was like? I was surprised later on thinking

46
00:05:38.04 --> 00:05:46.52
about this at that time. The Marine Corps was only 20,000. A lot of people that they felt

47
00:05:46.52 --> 00:05:56.04
forced them to be able to be selected to get in there actually. This is all in 1939 and long before

48
00:05:56.04 --> 00:06:02.28
we even thought we were going to get in World War II. It wasn't until, not much longer after I joined

49
00:06:02.28 --> 00:06:10.68
in 1939, that I went to a couple of weeks, just like the National Guard once a week,

50
00:06:10.68 --> 00:06:16.92
and have to rail right down right close to where we were having this broadcast right now, right across

51
00:06:16.92 --> 00:06:28.92
the road from us. Then I went to college, Warsaw State University, and had one year, one year of

52
00:06:28.92 --> 00:06:37.64
college, and went to two encampments with the organizers or one that first one is Sandy Eagle,

53
00:06:37.64 --> 00:06:47.96
the second one was to Brimerton. Then we got called active duty though in November of 1940.

54
00:06:48.76 --> 00:06:54.68
That's not very long. It was just a year. That's a year before we got into the war.

55
00:06:55.64 --> 00:07:02.28
Here we were called and went by two up train and we got about 300 of us at least, and ended up

56
00:07:02.28 --> 00:07:12.20
with Sandy Eagle, and that was that was for an accampment. Then a year later in November 1940,

57
00:07:12.20 --> 00:07:18.44
we were called in active duty. We thought we were going to be gone one year, but we were only

58
00:07:18.44 --> 00:07:25.56
gone what we were going for total of five years. So where were you when Pearl Harbor happened?

59
00:07:25.56 --> 00:07:30.76
When Pearl Harbor happened, we were in Sandy Eagle, and I was going through a Scott Sniper School,

60
00:07:30.76 --> 00:07:35.64
and I had a place called Mission Valley. I don't know if you've been to Sandy Eagle lately,

61
00:07:35.64 --> 00:07:42.12
but Mission Valley is now a mall. Isn't that amazing? That was nothing but a safe Russian

62
00:07:42.12 --> 00:07:47.16
and a lot of rattlesnakes. So you're going through that Sniper School Pearl Harbor happens,

63
00:07:48.12 --> 00:07:54.12
and what did they do? They immediately recall you, did they cancel your school? We all had returned

64
00:07:54.12 --> 00:08:01.96
to the base and we get ready to go here, go there, there was just all kinds of commands going out.

65
00:08:03.32 --> 00:08:07.72
First of all, hey, what to go here? No, no, we're going to go there and this, all of that.

66
00:08:07.72 --> 00:08:14.92
And despite of all of that, within one month, well, by first part of January,

67
00:08:14.92 --> 00:08:23.64
we were board of ship, heading to American Smaller, and to defend that island from the Japanese

68
00:08:23.64 --> 00:08:31.000
taken over and blocking the supply line from nine states to New Zealand and Australia.

69
00:08:32.04 --> 00:08:36.28
Now, did the Japanese ever show up? And attack that section of American Samo?

70
00:08:36.28 --> 00:08:47.96
They didn't for a long time. They would have, if a handman for what's that mean,

71
00:08:47.96 --> 00:08:53.000
island, and on the other hand, they'd be big battle midway. Midway. Midway. My age and middle

72
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.24
of the difficult recalling names anymore. It's all good. We got time. So at what point did you get

73
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.80
the next, the next orders that you are going to not just guard the silent anymore, you guys

74
00:09:07.80 --> 00:09:15.48
were going to head out? Yeah, about a month before we find a left, we've been training the

75
00:09:15.48 --> 00:09:22.28
Japanese young men who joined the join the Marine Corps reserve. And they took over the

76
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:30.28
guarding each of the little beaches all around the island, somewhere very remote. And so we're

77
00:09:30.28 --> 00:09:36.12
able to leave and had no idea where we're going. We thought, well, it could be the East Indies,

78
00:09:36.12 --> 00:09:43.16
who we had no idea. But on the other hand, we know it pretty much is going to be going to go out of

79
00:09:43.16 --> 00:09:48.76
Kaneal because we were having difficulties there. And somewhere in here, you got your commission

80
00:09:48.76 --> 00:09:53.80
becoming, and you became an officer. How did that happen? Okay, after we've been on

81
00:09:53.80 --> 00:10:01.80
small for about three or four months, I was now a corporal at as a squad leader of a machine gun

82
00:10:02.36 --> 00:10:11.48
like machine gun squad. And I got along very well with the NCOs and with our paternal

83
00:10:11.48 --> 00:10:20.84
leader. And so I was recommended to go to a machine gun, it was built as a machine gun training

84
00:10:20.84 --> 00:10:30.12
school. But it turned out it was just to identify likely candidates to become commissioned.

85
00:10:30.68 --> 00:10:38.20
So I recognize there was probably about, uh, could have been 150 or more of us. And it lasted six

86
00:10:38.20 --> 00:10:43.88
weeks. And here as a corporal, I was one of those selected to get a field commission.

87
00:10:44.60 --> 00:10:49.88
And that's it. You had one year of college, they put, put you from corporal to

88
00:10:50.68 --> 00:10:54.92
second lieutenant. To second lieutenant, and at that time we had no means of even getting

89
00:10:55.72 --> 00:11:02.92
getting any second Lieutenant bars. It had, it made one down at the, where they were,

90
00:11:02.92 --> 00:11:09.96
where they're, uh, aircraft were. So you guys just fashioned some, some butter bars for yourself.

91
00:11:09.96 --> 00:11:16.28
Right, we did. And then, and then next next thing when matter of, and parts first fire, no

92
00:11:16.28 --> 00:11:22.28
memory, this was only a month after I was commissioned. Uh, here we were bar ship heading to

93
00:11:22.28 --> 00:11:30.76
Lord knows where and turned out to be Guadalcanale. And here I am entering combat with the same group

94
00:11:30.76 --> 00:11:37.24
that I had been a list of it before the same company. And I know our first sergeant, he was a

95
00:11:37.24 --> 00:11:43.88
griffle guy. And he used to read me all like a theater, everybody else. But he saw that any time

96
00:11:43.88 --> 00:11:48.28
that I was giving a command that he said, you listen to your second lieutenant, you're going

97
00:11:48.28 --> 00:11:53.40
to have to contend with me. So that was just, it was just wonderful. So I was an extra officer assigned

98
00:11:53.40 --> 00:12:00.84
to the company headquarters. And that was pretty much the situation they had to have extra officers

99
00:12:00.84 --> 00:12:06.04
when they got in the casually, they could immediately fill a fill the ranks with, with a new

100
00:12:06.04 --> 00:12:11.48
pertune commander. And then that's a long story after, right, how I got into the actual

101
00:12:11.48 --> 00:12:18.52
action of itself. Not knowing how I was going to be able to react as a, as a young lieutenant leader.

102
00:12:18.52 --> 00:12:23.88
Well, you write about that here. Here, we'll go back to the book and here is you actually

103
00:12:23.88 --> 00:12:30.92
heading into Guadalcanale. And here we go. I remember thinking as my LCVP chug toward the beach

104
00:12:30.92 --> 00:12:37.000
that my time had come. And that it would be a time of testing when I would get to show what I was

105
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.44
made of at last. Even so, a part of me wished I were somewhere else. What if I failed the test?

106
00:12:44.44 --> 00:12:48.60
Yeah. I was assigned to the headquarters section of B company first battalion as an extra

107
00:12:48.60 --> 00:12:53.24
second lieutenant with no specific duties other than to follow whatever orders I was given,

108
00:12:53.24 --> 00:12:58.52
and make myself useful in whatever possible way. The regiment was actually above full strength

109
00:12:58.52 --> 00:13:02.68
with junior officers to spare. It was an unusual circumstance. And I knew it would suit,

110
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:07.96
soon change because junior officers typically suffer the highest casualties relative to the other

111
00:13:07.96 --> 00:13:13.88
ranks. A Trishin would quickly and inevitably take its toll. Lutonants and command of line units

112
00:13:13.88 --> 00:13:21.48
would get killed, wounded, injured, and sick. Extra is like me. Would replace them. Inevitably,

113
00:13:22.04 --> 00:13:27.64
a few junior officers would be relieved for incompetence or cowardice. I prayed that I wouldn't

114
00:13:27.64 --> 00:13:32.28
be one of them. That I wouldn't turn yellow and let my buddies down when the going got tough.

115
00:13:32.28 --> 00:13:40.28
A fate worse than death. As for death itself, no worries there. Getting killed was something

116
00:13:40.28 --> 00:13:48.12
that happened to the other guy. And then arrival, RLCVP's came to a gentle halt at the waterline,

117
00:13:48.12 --> 00:13:54.44
nosing into the sand of beach red between the Teneru River and Lunga Point. We climbed over the

118
00:13:54.44 --> 00:14:00.20
sides. There were no ramps on those early model of Higginboats, and we walked onto Guadalcanal.

119
00:14:00.68 --> 00:14:05.72
We hardly got our trousers wet. We experienced rougher landings during amphibious assault

120
00:14:05.72 --> 00:14:15.000
exercises outside San Diego. San Chamenie for one. So you're heading into Guadalcanal and there's

121
00:14:15.64 --> 00:14:19.64
it's a pretty calm entry even though there had been a lot of fighting going on.

122
00:14:19.64 --> 00:14:21.88
Yeah, previously they had been at that location.

123
00:14:23.80 --> 00:14:28.92
So once you get on Guadalcanal, you start to move towards the front lines.

124
00:14:28.92 --> 00:14:35.40
Yeah, in this case it was off of the opposite direction where the front lines were. The

125
00:14:35.40 --> 00:14:41.24
Japanese had landed. We waste south of us and there was concern that they were going to come

126
00:14:41.24 --> 00:14:52.36
in and develop us from that location. So our regiment moved out to Hedomoff and going through

127
00:14:52.36 --> 00:15:04.36
jungle and at night. We didn't know where we were. We'd finally got up to an army up at

128
00:15:04.36 --> 00:15:12.60
the 164th from the quotas. They had just ended up shooting each other just the day before.

129
00:15:13.40 --> 00:15:21.32
Here we saw blood all over the place from that situation. We ended up at night and we just had to

130
00:15:21.32 --> 00:15:29.24
stop right along a river bank and I had my feet dangling in the water at the time. So anyway,

131
00:15:30.20 --> 00:15:36.60
we never did with the Japanese. They're all suddenly disappeared from that particular location.

132
00:15:36.60 --> 00:15:42.68
But that was a try. Quite a try in time. Just what it's like to move into combat. Not

133
00:15:42.68 --> 00:15:48.52
no one's going to happen next. You know one thing that I talk about a lot is the possibility

134
00:15:48.52 --> 00:15:54.36
of friendly fire occurring. Yeah, exactly what happened. I know I had friendly fire incidents happen

135
00:15:54.36 --> 00:16:01.72
with me in Iraq and this happened to you as well. I'm going to the book here. You've been moving

136
00:16:01.72 --> 00:16:06.76
for a while and you're holding up at night and you guys are in your position then all of a sudden

137
00:16:06.76 --> 00:16:12.68
bang someone yelled another shot fired. Yeah. And then another and then another several shots and

138
00:16:12.68 --> 00:16:18.36
quick succession all from our foxholes. More shots all at once and just the whole company shooting,

139
00:16:18.36 --> 00:16:22.52
firing every which way shooting and shouting grenades with their own bursting left and right,

140
00:16:22.52 --> 00:16:27.96
front and to my rear explosions and muzzle blasts lift the area like popping flash bolts.

141
00:16:27.96 --> 00:16:33.16
Corporal Lane was hitting the arm a minor wound but he didn't think that it was minor. He panicked

142
00:16:33.16 --> 00:16:38.76
and shouted out to Sergeant Wimpy right. Top my my arm shot off. Since right and

143
00:16:38.76 --> 00:16:43.000
Lane were best buddies. A show of concern from the first sergeant might have might in the circumstances

144
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.24
have been expected and when certainly have been warranted. But right and old salt, who is

145
00:16:47.24 --> 00:16:52.28
crusty as they come was not practiced and showing concern even to best buddies who had been wounded

146
00:16:52.28 --> 00:16:57.000
in combat. Muddering just loud enough to make himself heard above the racket. Right replied,

147
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.04
shut up you fool. You want to let them know where I am? The shooting continued. More grenades

148
00:17:02.04 --> 00:17:05.88
exploded. PFC Harold Park, a bargarner with first platoon,

149
00:17:05.88 --> 00:17:10.92
realized that several men just to his left were throwing grenades all around the darn place. The

150
00:17:10.92 --> 00:17:16.36
guys were just having a little hang grenade war with each other. Maybe the Japanese were out there

151
00:17:16.36 --> 00:17:21.56
too tossing a few grenades of their own but parked in think so. He stayed low and didn't fire his weapon.

152
00:17:21.56 --> 00:17:25.40
I didn't figure would do any good even if they were Japanese. You couldn't see nothing.

153
00:17:25.40 --> 00:17:33.16
All you could do is park was a half Korean and half I have Irish.

154
00:17:33.16 --> 00:17:38.76
Yes sir. I had a lot of contact with them after the war as well.

155
00:17:38.76 --> 00:17:44.76
So it was important for him to because I know you say in the book that that he inherited his

156
00:17:44.76 --> 00:17:50.28
father's looks not as mothers. So he looked more Korean. We told him he'd better stay close.

157
00:17:52.28 --> 00:18:01.80
Yeah that's a rough one. So you get done with this. This just happening basically all night.

158
00:18:01.80 --> 00:18:05.64
I mean crazy fire fights and you don't even know if there's any Japanese.

159
00:18:05.64 --> 00:18:12.04
Well that's time. My Murdoch Murdoch was acting a company commander at that time and

160
00:18:13.08 --> 00:18:19.72
man near him got shot through the abdomen area and he's more concerned that he lost it

161
00:18:19.72 --> 00:18:25.40
a lot of his private parts. What are you doing?

162
00:18:25.40 --> 00:18:30.28
Now was Murdoch? Did Murdoch have experience from some of the other campaigns?

163
00:18:30.28 --> 00:18:33.64
No he was just like the rest of us. We're all new to combat.

164
00:18:36.68 --> 00:18:43.96
Speaking of near misses and whatnot, you're waiting to do a link up and here we go back to the book.

165
00:18:43.96 --> 00:18:47.96
I thought I might grab a quick bite to eat and start to open my sea ration can.

166
00:18:47.96 --> 00:18:52.52
In the process I somehow managed to cut my thumb to the bone. Blood gust from the wound and I

167
00:18:52.52 --> 00:18:57.56
spent some frantic moments applying a field dressing to stomp the flow. The noncombs and enlisted men

168
00:18:57.56 --> 00:19:01.08
watched me probably trying hard not to laugh at me. I still have a scar right there and that's

169
00:19:01.08 --> 00:19:07.64
thumb from that. And they're watching their thinking second lieutenant's are idiots. Hard to

170
00:19:07.64 --> 00:19:14.76
argue with that assessment which the lower ranks held as virtually at axiomatic. And I just given

171
00:19:14.76 --> 00:19:19.32
them another reason for their certified how humiliating and annoying the cut would not fully heal as long

172
00:19:19.32 --> 00:19:24.44
as I remain on Guadalcanal and I still bear a scar from it. Thus far the chief dangers in Guadalcanal

173
00:19:24.44 --> 00:19:30.52
posed to my well being it come from one my buddies via friendly fire and two myself. The

174
00:19:30.52 --> 00:19:36.04
Japanese in comparison had been a relatively benign presence. There are a couple of situations right

175
00:19:36.04 --> 00:19:42.60
at that same time that happened. One was a young marine from another outfit. He was a real bad

176
00:19:42.60 --> 00:19:48.36
he thought he was he's really good there. He says I'm used to all this stuff. And here he had a

177
00:19:48.36 --> 00:19:55.16
Japanese skull hanging from a from a court of some sort and he was just swinging that around crazy.

178
00:19:55.16 --> 00:20:00.44
Then a little bit later within within an hour or so we had a big air rain just hundreds of

179
00:20:00.44 --> 00:20:08.52
Japanese planes dropped drop bombs on us. And then I was watching one of our an aircraft cruise

180
00:20:08.52 --> 00:20:15.32
cruiseers shooting at him and many of their planes dropped at that time. But that was that was really

181
00:20:15.32 --> 00:20:21.16
a really getting into it in deep way but not really directly in direct wire at the time.

182
00:20:21.16 --> 00:20:27.64
So that time that kid that you talk about and you mentioned in the book this is sort of the

183
00:20:27.64 --> 00:20:31.40
so he's a guy that had been fighting somewhere else and he comes back and so this is the first

184
00:20:31.40 --> 00:20:37.40
person that you see that you look at that's starting to be you know he's having some let's see how

185
00:20:37.40 --> 00:20:43.48
did you put it he had acclimated to conditions on Guadalcanal that's what you wrote and you know

186
00:20:43.48 --> 00:20:50.44
however long that takes before you know it's a different it's a different it's a different environment

187
00:20:50.44 --> 00:20:57.48
it's a completely different mindset and that's what he was doing. Now these all these young people

188
00:20:57.48 --> 00:21:02.92
they all had beers now you know they haven't shaved for a long time and they they had the

189
00:21:02.92 --> 00:21:08.68
hand hand up food really the reading Japanese rice and whatnot because our transfers all had to

190
00:21:08.68 --> 00:21:16.68
leave they loaded off the troops but most of the mature all of the food stuff they were able

191
00:21:16.68 --> 00:21:21.56
to unload so they had eat this Japanese food so anyway they were pretty good looking people

192
00:21:21.56 --> 00:21:27.24
but even so they were full of they were full of full of fight you could tell young people and

193
00:21:27.24 --> 00:21:34.28
you know young guys that are in their teens still you know you get into this

194
00:21:34.28 --> 00:21:36.28
uh...

195
00:21:36.28 --> 00:21:40.04
motton account and i say that right the motton account metan account yeah

196
00:21:40.04 --> 00:21:45.16
metan account uh... this this river

197
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:49.88
this offensive that you guys start on ten november which is the hundred sixty seven

198
00:21:49.88 --> 00:21:53.16
anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps and here we go to the book separating

199
00:21:53.16 --> 00:21:57.88
our forces from their geographical objective of coastal village with some four miles of

200
00:21:57.88 --> 00:22:03.24
of exceptionally rugged terrain grassy ridges falling away steeply to jungle choke ravines

201
00:22:03.24 --> 00:22:07.32
in several thousand japanese infantry men also exceptionally rugged

202
00:22:07.32 --> 00:22:12.04
our mission objective was to engage defeat and destroy the enemy formations in our path

203
00:22:12.76 --> 00:22:16.68
our assault units advanced solely but steadily against the term in resistance the eighth

204
00:22:16.68 --> 00:22:23.000
marines ordered to move up in column behind the two seven filed across a narrow pontoon bridge

205
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.76
over the motton account metan account and continue to short distance before halting for new

206
00:22:28.76 --> 00:22:34.76
in child as before the sweep to call the point we encountered no japanese the attacking

207
00:22:34.76 --> 00:22:38.20
units are driven them off but we suffered casualties just the same

208
00:22:38.20 --> 00:22:44.04
that's it's been a bit about there we were we had the child uh... there were many japanese

209
00:22:44.04 --> 00:22:48.44
bodies lying about some had been partially buried some of the eggs are still sticking

210
00:22:48.44 --> 00:22:53.72
up uh... there been a major battle between between them attacking

211
00:22:53.72 --> 00:22:57.96
the other rains that have been there just before we were weeks before

212
00:22:57.96 --> 00:23:02.12
and here all these mung all these bodies and flies and maggots everything was

213
00:23:02.12 --> 00:23:05.000
so we ate among all of that

214
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.64
yeah your sense of some some guys would

215
00:23:07.64 --> 00:23:13.48
could couldn't even carry on barely because it smelled so bad yeah yeah yeah

216
00:23:13.48 --> 00:23:19.08
this right near a place called point crews by the way and today it is a city well

217
00:23:19.08 --> 00:23:25.56
of over twenty thousand that's the capital of the of the cell of solman islands

218
00:23:25.56 --> 00:23:29.32
at this point you actually say in the book as you were sitting there amongst all these

219
00:23:29.32 --> 00:23:34.52
bodies these dead bodies and as you're sitting there eating your child

220
00:23:34.52 --> 00:23:39.32
you say like that kid twirling the skull i was acclimating to the conditions on

221
00:23:39.32 --> 00:23:44.92
guadal canal i'd been on the island for seven days

222
00:23:44.92 --> 00:23:47.56
so that's an indication to you

223
00:23:47.56 --> 00:23:51.24
so then you guys later that day and enemy unit penetrator online and ambush weapons

224
00:23:51.24 --> 00:23:55.96
patoon killing three marines with a burst of enemy fire with with a burst of machine gun fire

225
00:23:55.96 --> 00:23:59.80
and then the entire offensive had suddenly been called off

226
00:23:59.80 --> 00:24:03.48
and not only that we're gonna give up the ground we had taken relinquishing it to the

227
00:24:03.48 --> 00:24:06.92
japanese what the hell we thought

228
00:24:06.92 --> 00:24:11.72
so you get told hey you guys stop attacking

229
00:24:11.72 --> 00:24:14.68
the reason was which you'll get into in this a bit

230
00:24:14.68 --> 00:24:18.52
is that there's a major task force the japanese

231
00:24:18.52 --> 00:24:22.36
but twelve transfers full of troops can you imagine

232
00:24:22.36 --> 00:24:26.68
and uh... battleship and cruisers and lot of destroyers

233
00:24:26.68 --> 00:24:29.000
and they they were gonna they were gonna just

234
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.36
knock us off of there

235
00:24:30.36 --> 00:24:35.96
we had we had we didn't have a good feel that it was that dire but boy it

236
00:24:35.96 --> 00:24:38.36
turned out it was because that

237
00:24:38.36 --> 00:24:42.52
and when they did come in at night we saw him come in the mid-no-fammer

238
00:24:42.52 --> 00:24:47.96
and uh... major battle between the naval battle called the naval battle called al canal

239
00:24:47.96 --> 00:24:51.80
and uh... you never know watching at night time you didn't know

240
00:24:51.80 --> 00:24:55.80
who's your our ships and which are theirs all sent you see something blow up

241
00:24:55.80 --> 00:24:59.80
you see red hot shells being fired going back and criss-crossing fact

242
00:24:59.80 --> 00:25:02.28
back and forth and then the next

243
00:25:02.28 --> 00:25:03.72
next morning

244
00:25:03.72 --> 00:25:07.08
he was they have had troops have the uh...

245
00:25:07.08 --> 00:25:10.68
some are men that there there's their own ships were sunk

246
00:25:10.68 --> 00:25:14.12
and now they they're all full of oil and they're

247
00:25:14.12 --> 00:25:17.32
coming up there could now they're landing on our shore

248
00:25:17.32 --> 00:25:19.56
it was uh... what and here we used

249
00:25:19.56 --> 00:25:21.72
watching from a grandstand

250
00:25:21.72 --> 00:25:24.92
viewpoint on a ridge watching all this happen

251
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:28.60
and incredible did you did you know that

252
00:25:28.60 --> 00:25:31.56
this naval battle was about to take place

253
00:25:31.56 --> 00:25:33.80
didn't know it's gonna be anything like that

254
00:25:33.80 --> 00:25:35.24
imagine

255
00:25:35.24 --> 00:25:38.84
roughly twelve transports full of troops

256
00:25:38.84 --> 00:25:42.36
all but all but three of them were sunk

257
00:25:42.36 --> 00:25:45.08
and the three that did beech

258
00:25:45.08 --> 00:25:49.000
the troops got off but all their supplies and stuff

259
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.36
remained on

260
00:25:50.36 --> 00:25:51.80
and and we have

261
00:25:51.80 --> 00:25:53.000
our planes

262
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.52
bomb bomb that and try our church

263
00:25:56.52 --> 00:25:59.64
so we had those we we had to reckon

264
00:25:59.64 --> 00:26:03.08
with those troops that came we got off of those transports

265
00:26:03.08 --> 00:26:05.000
and the next or the next week or so

266
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.32
your your description of this battle

267
00:26:07.32 --> 00:26:07.64
yeah

268
00:26:07.64 --> 00:26:09.08
is

269
00:26:09.08 --> 00:26:11.08
is crazy to read i'm gonna read it

270
00:26:11.08 --> 00:26:14.76
the battle between the american and japanese surface fleets began a little before

271
00:26:14.76 --> 00:26:18.04
zero to two hundred like a suddenly breaking storm of

272
00:26:18.04 --> 00:26:20.44
cataclysmic size and power

273
00:26:20.44 --> 00:26:22.76
in the language of naval tacticians

274
00:26:22.76 --> 00:26:26.04
the coming together of two fleets in sea-large channel

275
00:26:26.04 --> 00:26:27.88
constituted what is known as a meeting

276
00:26:27.88 --> 00:26:29.80
engage in engagement

277
00:26:29.80 --> 00:26:32.84
but collision engagement is a better term

278
00:26:32.84 --> 00:26:35.40
for describing what happened steaming more

279
00:26:35.40 --> 00:26:38.36
or less blindly into the channel of fleets ran into each other at

280
00:26:38.36 --> 00:26:39.40
oblique angles

281
00:26:39.40 --> 00:26:42.28
their ships quickly became intermingled resulting in

282
00:26:42.28 --> 00:26:46.20
a close quarters melee that saw the combatants charging

283
00:26:46.20 --> 00:26:50.12
madly about their big guns flashing and booming hurling red hot

284
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:53.24
shells and high flaming arcs above the channel

285
00:26:53.24 --> 00:26:56.44
the thunder of the guns rolled across the black water

286
00:26:56.44 --> 00:26:59.64
a steady pulsating roar and the molten projectile

287
00:26:59.64 --> 00:27:03.08
streak leg meteors crisscrossing the skies with fiery

288
00:27:03.08 --> 00:27:07.96
tails rising and falling and crashing into ships and exploding in massive fireballs

289
00:27:07.96 --> 00:27:12.12
violent secondary explosions caused by ammunition cooking off in the intense heat

290
00:27:12.12 --> 00:27:14.92
of the detonating shells rock some of the ships and sent them

291
00:27:14.92 --> 00:27:16.36
furiously ablaze

292
00:27:16.36 --> 00:27:18.52
blurning like roman candles

293
00:27:18.52 --> 00:27:22.84
fountains of fire sparking and shooting flames and blasting big chunks of steel

294
00:27:22.84 --> 00:27:27.64
in every direction all the while star shells and flares burst high above the

295
00:27:27.64 --> 00:27:31.64
channel and invaded like dying galaxies as they drifted down at the end of their

296
00:27:31.64 --> 00:27:34.20
parachutes into the extinguishing water

297
00:27:34.20 --> 00:27:37.96
the canisters that held the flares periodically flew over our positions

298
00:27:37.96 --> 00:27:42.28
charging like locomotives search lights probe the dirt lower darkness

299
00:27:42.28 --> 00:27:46.28
with their long brilliant beams sweeping back and forth above the surface

300
00:27:46.28 --> 00:27:51.32
by secting fixing on some hapless ship bringing the blazing shells down on it

301
00:27:51.32 --> 00:27:55.48
streams of tracers from automatic cannons and machine guns

302
00:27:55.48 --> 00:27:58.12
curved through the middle of the air every now and then an

303
00:27:58.12 --> 00:28:00.84
airant torpedo slammed into the beach below us

304
00:28:00.84 --> 00:28:06.52
2500 pounds of explosives blasting a big crater at the waterline

305
00:28:06.52 --> 00:28:10.12
we watched all this from our foxes on the ridge front row seats to

306
00:28:10.12 --> 00:28:14.92
a spectacle that john murder john mordocla likened to all the fourth of

307
00:28:14.92 --> 00:28:18.84
July's I ever saw my life all put together at once

308
00:28:18.84 --> 00:28:23.72
we were a vocal audience awestruck and profane a ship would explode

309
00:28:23.72 --> 00:28:27.16
and all up and down the line you'd hear men exclaiming

310
00:28:27.16 --> 00:28:32.60
cheese a surprise and holy shit and oh my fucking god did you see that

311
00:28:32.60 --> 00:28:37.08
it was thrilling really you couldn't help but feel that way but i also couldn't

312
00:28:37.08 --> 00:28:41.24
help at wondering which ships were ours and how we could dis- and how they could

313
00:28:41.24 --> 00:28:44.92
distinguish friend from foe i thought of the many men who were losing their

314
00:28:44.92 --> 00:28:49.40
young lives right before our eyes i felt very fortunate to be in safe in my

315
00:28:49.40 --> 00:28:56.52
foxhole and i wondered who's winning yeah we had no idea who was winning

316
00:28:56.52 --> 00:29:03.08
yeah just we just knew that what i we had seen a massive combat

317
00:29:03.08 --> 00:29:07.000
just incredible and we were at a ring side seat

318
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.96
now as that's going on obviously you have to realize that if the americans don't

319
00:29:13.96 --> 00:29:19.40
win this thing yeah that was it you guys are done yeah yeah

320
00:29:19.40 --> 00:29:24.52
can you imagine a convoy like that that many transports

321
00:29:24.52 --> 00:29:28.68
they they probably matched our numbers at that time if they had got all gotten

322
00:29:28.68 --> 00:29:33.56
a shore but they didn't yeah

323
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:40.92
early the next morning be company crossed the river to spearhead the attack by

324
00:29:40.92 --> 00:29:47.80
another green army battalion the one the first the 182nd along the coastal flat

325
00:29:47.80 --> 00:29:53.64
toward the base of point crews so you guys you guys took lead yeah we were

326
00:29:53.64 --> 00:29:58.04
we were spearheading that particular attack you know you talk about you

327
00:29:58.04 --> 00:30:01.32
you mentioned to win be right a little earlier and that's a heck of a nick name

328
00:30:01.32 --> 00:30:05.08
then doesn't sound like it's easy for a couple and thought about that true

329
00:30:05.08 --> 00:30:09.56
but but we talk about you know a lot of times we talk about leadership on this podcast

330
00:30:09.56 --> 00:30:15.000
and you do a great description of this kind of transition and the relationship that you had

331
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.56
with wimpy right i think it's worse well this is this is my co-author Steve

332
00:30:19.56 --> 00:30:26.52
wine gardener tell you he was he's a he's a great you know he got a award for a

333
00:30:26.52 --> 00:30:31.72
police woman that that escaped the holy cost okay

334
00:30:31.72 --> 00:30:37.56
call lala story well we can definitely look into that book yeah oh yeah

335
00:30:37.56 --> 00:30:42.84
here's how he describes your relationship with him wimpy right was the company's first

336
00:30:42.84 --> 00:30:47.40
sergeant he was a tough old salt shorten stocky late 30s or 40s old enough to be my

337
00:30:47.40 --> 00:30:51.08
father old enough for that matted matter to be the father of quite a few of the

338
00:30:51.08 --> 00:30:54.68
loutenates in the regiment he was going on 20 years in the Marine Corps and it's

339
00:30:54.68 --> 00:30:59.48
served in china nicaragua and Haiti he was no new comber to war no stranger to combat

340
00:30:59.48 --> 00:31:05.56
he was also in our terms he possessed a commanding voice which he used in a full

341
00:31:05.56 --> 00:31:11.000
throated bellow when reading off one of his charges when reading off one of his charges

342
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.88
for doing something stupid on sumo before i was commissioned i had been one of his charges

343
00:31:15.88 --> 00:31:22.44
and it usually more than once deservedly been on the receiving end of one of his

344
00:31:22.44 --> 00:31:29.56
herangs but now i outranked him i was at first uncomfortable with our new relationship

345
00:31:29.56 --> 00:31:33.24
i found it hard to imagine giving orders to a man who not so long ago had been

346
00:31:33.24 --> 00:31:37.000
shouting in my face and giving me a dressing down the likes of which i'd never

347
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.28
experienced before and never would again it wasn't that i was afraid of him rather i

348
00:31:42.28 --> 00:31:46.84
respected him too much and knew him and knew too well that he was a great marine to think that

349
00:31:46.84 --> 00:31:51.80
i could or should be telling what to do and i thought that he might resent my status

350
00:31:51.80 --> 00:31:58.36
and just to be cantankerous make things difficult for me i need never worried about right

351
00:31:58.36 --> 00:32:03.96
a consummate professional he supported me fully and ceseerly sincerely i should have expected

352
00:32:03.96 --> 00:32:09.000
that after all it was because of his recommendation that i received my commission he looked

353
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.44
on me as his protege and he wanted me to succeed in part because my success would reflect well on

354
00:32:14.44 --> 00:32:21.000
him but mainly because he was generally genuinely proud of me also because i was a known quantity

355
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.52
whom he had personally mentored he much preferred me to be giving orders rather than some 90

356
00:32:26.52 --> 00:32:30.60
day wonder fresh out of training in the states since he had taught me everything i knew he was

357
00:32:30.60 --> 00:32:35.32
confident that in combat together we would more or less be thinking along the same lines and

358
00:32:35.32 --> 00:32:40.44
important connection for a top sergeant to have with his petoon leader nor did he know what he

359
00:32:40.44 --> 00:32:45.48
broke the slightest in subordination toward me from anyone else in the petoon you obey your lieutenant

360
00:32:45.48 --> 00:32:50.28
or you'll have to answer to me he growled at my guys and you could be damn sure they did nobody

361
00:32:50.28 --> 00:32:57.08
wanted to have to answer to right sounds like an outstanding marine i'm pretty soon you're going

362
00:32:57.08 --> 00:33:04.92
again me getting into a part is my my first encounter of very close calls was losing my life

363
00:33:09.48 --> 00:33:15.08
on hill 78 second platoon was dealing with a lone sniper who had fired on us from the open

364
00:33:15.08 --> 00:33:20.36
trees on the coastal flap of below he was high up in one of those trees high enough to place

365
00:33:20.36 --> 00:33:25.40
my little above the hilltop allowing him to shoot down to us at a shallow angle he pottered us

366
00:33:25.40 --> 00:33:32.92
pottered us for a better part of four hours and then by the buy and buy and much to my astonishment

367
00:33:32.92 --> 00:33:37.32
a lieutenant i didn't recognize came strolling along in the ridge fully upright fully exposed

368
00:33:37.32 --> 00:33:42.60
this sniper smirking at us i was lying on the belly on my belly in the grass and he approached me

369
00:33:42.60 --> 00:33:47.88
saying i would be worried about that sniper can't hit me one in the next instant a shot rang out

370
00:33:47.88 --> 00:33:57.64
and a bullet wing disarm can't get complacent uh you continue on i didn't much care where that

371
00:33:57.64 --> 00:34:01.96
lieutenant won or what happened to him i wanted to get that sniper i pulled out my field glasses

372
00:34:01.96 --> 00:34:07.16
and scan the trees below our position as luck would have it i spotted the sniper almost at once that

373
00:34:07.16 --> 00:34:13.000
is i spotted his pude wrapped legs and booted feet dangling from the limb of a huge banyan

374
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.56
tree about 150 yards from my position i lifted the field glasses a notch to the clump of

375
00:34:17.56 --> 00:34:23.000
leaves where those above those legs i couldn't see him but he had to be there japanese legs

376
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.32
were always attached to japanese bodies just then he took a shot at me he must have seen me looking

377
00:34:29.32 --> 00:34:33.64
maybe my field glasses glinting the sun and give me a way his bullet hit the ground just

378
00:34:33.64 --> 00:34:39.48
inches from my nose sprang dirt my face i dropped my field glasses and snatched up my spring field

379
00:34:39.48 --> 00:34:44.12
firing from the prone position i unloaded the entire clip at the clump of leaves above his feet

380
00:34:44.12 --> 00:34:49.40
five shots one after the other working the bolt quickly put smooth me but smoothly so it's

381
00:34:49.40 --> 00:34:54.04
not spoiled my aim just as i had been taught to do and just as i had practiced on the Marine

382
00:34:54.04 --> 00:34:59.000
Coriful ranges i didn't think about it i didn't have to think all that training just kicked right

383
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.40
in and i killed the man who had been trying to kill me he didn't drop from the tree he didn't

384
00:35:03.40 --> 00:35:08.36
drop his rifle but that was to be expected japanese snipers customarily tied themselves and the

385
00:35:08.36 --> 00:35:14.84
rifles to the trees bottom line he didn't shoot at us after that he was dead all right the first man i

386
00:35:14.84 --> 00:35:24.60
had killed yes that's my first my first call the first call the first call of life having around hit

387
00:35:24.60 --> 00:35:33.32
right front of your face i'm not gonna dirt my face oh he he spotted me i was no longer somebody

388
00:35:33.32 --> 00:35:43.000
to harass i was somebody it was gonna kill him now we had a dog a dog going on all right

389
00:35:44.20 --> 00:35:49.64
the eighth Marines first and second battians were to advance by side in columns in tourvine

390
00:35:49.64 --> 00:35:56.12
then attack and capture hill 83 ridge line the first battalion was to move forward on the right

391
00:35:56.12 --> 00:35:59.96
be company would lead in the battians advance and my platoon would lead the company's advance

392
00:35:59.96 --> 00:36:05.24
so that you put you does that put your company right your your company right at the front

393
00:36:05.24 --> 00:36:08.76
yeah that you're pulled to and right at the front of the company and we were at that time we

394
00:36:08.76 --> 00:36:14.20
we were right and red in the crux of it following it our an artillery bombardment second

395
00:36:14.20 --> 00:36:18.44
platoon with the rest of the battalion behind it passed through the army lines and advanced into the

396
00:36:18.44 --> 00:36:23.16
ravine enemy machine guns and riflemen fired down on us from concealed positions on the ridge

397
00:36:23.16 --> 00:36:30.60
some 75 yards ahead and above us machine guns chattered rut relentlessly ripping through the jungle

398
00:36:30.60 --> 00:36:36.68
rustling foliage clipping branches and leaves corporal Olson de Moss and his squad led the way moving

399
00:36:36.68 --> 00:36:41.80
up out of the ravine and onto the ridge suddenly a voice shouted baker company get off the

400
00:36:41.80 --> 00:36:47.56
ridge huh i looked around at my man who gave that order most of my men had gone to ground hiding

401
00:36:47.56 --> 00:36:52.52
in the bush as and were invisible to the Japanese that's the nature of jungle warfare everyone tries

402
00:36:52.52 --> 00:36:57.24
to stay hidden you can hardly see anyone either enemy or friendly the battlefield seems empty

403
00:36:57.24 --> 00:37:01.64
and you feel and you can feel alone and isolated on it especially when you're in command especially

404
00:37:01.64 --> 00:37:05.32
when in the middle of a firefight and when somebody else starts giving orders to your men

405
00:37:05.32 --> 00:37:09.16
I looked around and a few of the men I could see stared back at me there there are

406
00:37:09.16 --> 00:37:14.52
ex-blank expressions a firm denial it wasn't me a few minutes later de Moss and his squad

407
00:37:14.52 --> 00:37:18.76
returned to the ravine having relinquished their brief hold on the ridge top somebody although

408
00:37:18.76 --> 00:37:24.04
us to get off de Moss explained he thought one of our guys had given the order then we both

409
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:29.40
realized what had happened those clever Japanese one of them someone flutten American English had given

410
00:37:29.40 --> 00:37:34.68
that order very clever he must be pleased with himself he must be laughing at us just about now

411
00:37:34.68 --> 00:37:41.48
him and his men laughing and how did he know that we were baker company you heard us heard

412
00:37:41.48 --> 00:37:46.52
us say that that's it now we're going to get a little bit a little bit later than this now I take

413
00:37:46.52 --> 00:37:52.60
over the puttoon second puttoon they puttoon later was yellow he wouldn't he wouldn't get

414
00:37:52.60 --> 00:37:58.84
up out of his hole so now I'm in charge and you're going to get into what the close calls I had

415
00:37:58.84 --> 00:38:04.84
there are boy they were they were mighty close unbelievable I don't know how I survived it

416
00:38:07.80 --> 00:38:11.96
yeah going back to this we risen to our uphill attack and we were met with more devastating

417
00:38:11.96 --> 00:38:17.56
machine gun and rifle fire so would you say this this engagement right here is the first time

418
00:38:17.56 --> 00:38:25.40
that you were under real oh yeah okay yeah other than getting bombed other than having

419
00:38:25.40 --> 00:38:31.40
area of attack other than it's not for shooting this this was it this is it is about a closest

420
00:38:31.40 --> 00:38:37.16
close to a call in second be I tell you we kept going for going forward firing on the move leaning

421
00:38:37.16 --> 00:38:41.08
slightly into the incline shooting from the shoulder and hip firing blindly at the top of the ridge

422
00:38:41.08 --> 00:38:44.84
we couldn't see the enemy but we knew he was up there dimos on my left banged away with his

423
00:38:44.84 --> 00:38:49.48
springfield just as fast as he could work the bolt and that his rifle seeves seized up dimos

424
00:38:49.48 --> 00:38:53.88
looked at me and I looked at him and the spell was broken just like just that fast I came out

425
00:38:53.88 --> 00:38:59.88
of my battle trance I felt very exposed and insecure judging by the wide eyed look he gave me

426
00:38:59.88 --> 00:39:05.16
dimos felt the same dimos inspectors rifle discovered that he had a bullet had pierced his magazine

427
00:39:05.16 --> 00:39:11.56
barely missing the nose his nose in the process he never cursed never uttered profanities and now

428
00:39:11.56 --> 00:39:16.76
true to form his big eyes still as saucers his eyes still as big as saucers he exclaimed

429
00:39:16.76 --> 00:39:21.96
well I'll be a dirty name then he discarded his rifle and started throwing grenades at the top of the

430
00:39:21.96 --> 00:39:28.60
ridge the reality of our sudden harrowing plight then struck me this was my first major combat

431
00:39:28.60 --> 00:39:34.04
test as a platoon leader and I realized that I had to take immediate and firm control of myself

432
00:39:34.04 --> 00:39:39.56
I could not show fear in front of my men a couple feet to my right private McCoy Reynolds had

433
00:39:39.56 --> 00:39:44.20
been hurling grenades one after the other each time courageously standing up and exposing himself

434
00:39:44.20 --> 00:39:49.08
to enemy fire he crouched down next to me and scanned the top of the ridge then he exclaimed I see

435
00:39:49.08 --> 00:39:55.000
them and threw another grenade in the next instant he was shot through the neck killed instantly

436
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.60
he fell at my feet for a moment I just looked at him his eyes wide open lifeless stared back at me

437
00:40:00.60 --> 00:40:05.24
then I realized that now more than ever I had to get a grip on things and seize control

438
00:40:05.24 --> 00:40:11.64
of what was becoming an increasingly chaotic situation I decided at once we needed support from our

439
00:40:11.64 --> 00:40:17.64
mortars and backed a little way down the ridge out of the field of fire to further assess the situation

440
00:40:22.12 --> 00:40:28.44
now at the same time we were running low on an ammunition as well and we sent back call we need

441
00:40:28.44 --> 00:40:33.24
more ammunition next thing we know bandaliar after bandaliar of ammunition started arriving

442
00:40:34.04 --> 00:40:40.92
just the same as same Guided guys now that's an interesting I mean you recognized

443
00:40:41.72 --> 00:40:46.76
that that you needed to get control of your emotions

444
00:40:48.60 --> 00:40:53.80
is that something you would thought about what made you realize that what made you realize oh wow

445
00:40:53.80 --> 00:40:59.24
I better do something because I'm in charge and I need to make some decisions here I don't I don't

446
00:40:59.24 --> 00:41:04.44
know all of a sudden fear went away I guess I didn't have fear right at that time

447
00:41:06.44 --> 00:41:11.96
and it's also interesting but I saw the dire situation here we were in a situation that

448
00:41:12.52 --> 00:41:21.08
we we had we we were committed and either to keep going or are we gonna back up then back off

449
00:41:21.08 --> 00:41:26.04
finally we were called back down and now knowing that that that's the same kind of movement

450
00:41:26.04 --> 00:41:33.56
went clear to the top and decided to just call off that drive in general here I was at the

451
00:41:33.56 --> 00:41:40.60
I was at the spares head right there it was called off and they just said that the general

452
00:41:40.60 --> 00:41:48.28
from the top on down was that okay we stopped going after him and losing troops and that's just

453
00:41:48.28 --> 00:41:55.40
let him try in the vine well yeah because at this point you had we controlled we controlled

454
00:41:55.40 --> 00:42:00.60
all the ways we controlled this up we had taken out their supplies so let's do some siege warfare

455
00:42:00.60 --> 00:42:07.96
and make them wait yeah make them star so wait we had no more fighting we had a firm

456
00:42:09.08 --> 00:42:16.76
the fans line along a ridge for a month just just held a line continue with these setting up

457
00:42:16.76 --> 00:42:21.32
reconnaissance patrols next year you know are they doing what they were doing and I led

458
00:42:21.32 --> 00:42:27.32
Denver reconnaissance patrol myself taking out four or five men with me and finding out where they were

459
00:42:27.32 --> 00:42:33.32
that was scary situation to all these reconnaissance patrols you know right before they before they

460
00:42:33.32 --> 00:42:38.60
stopped that as you're still pushing forward up that ridge you got some great detail in here that's

461
00:42:38.60 --> 00:42:44.20
absolutely worth talking about going to the book here the ammunition was quickly distributed so

462
00:42:44.20 --> 00:42:48.68
you called for ammunition the ammunition was quickly distributed and once again we moved up hill

463
00:42:48.68 --> 00:42:55.72
shooting as we went another of my man men private Walter Cuss was favorally hit while scouting up the

464
00:42:55.72 --> 00:43:00.84
ridge from a different direction at the moment of his death he exailed the his last breath

465
00:43:00.84 --> 00:43:06.44
and that out a long rising how of pain and anguish like a dying animal yeah didn't sound like

466
00:43:06.44 --> 00:43:11.88
human being several attempts were made to reach him and dragon back all on successful

467
00:43:11.88 --> 00:43:18.68
PFC James Bell said I'm going up there all bring him down he was often running before anyone could

468
00:43:18.68 --> 00:43:24.44
stop him yeah on his own he did that and he was shot through the chest well before reaching Cuss's body

469
00:43:25.40 --> 00:43:30.60
we were able to retrieve Bell and he was still alive as we cared him down and out of a line of fire

470
00:43:30.60 --> 00:43:36.44
but he was just about gone he had a sucking chest wound that made it increasingly difficult to breathe

471
00:43:36.44 --> 00:43:38.60
hoping about size he couldn't breathe you see

472
00:43:38.60 --> 00:43:43.80
this was the first time I had seen such a wound and it was a terrible sight our corpsman tried

473
00:43:43.80 --> 00:43:48.12
to patch him up but there was little he could do a sucking chest wound needs to be sealed internally

474
00:43:48.12 --> 00:43:54.36
as well as externally and the corpsman could only treat the outside finally Bell said it looks like

475
00:43:54.36 --> 00:44:01.72
this is goodbye and then he calmly died just like in the movies I thought with his last words and

476
00:44:01.72 --> 00:44:08.28
everything yeah soon after that we quit attacking and withdrew we couldn't dislodge the enemy from the

477
00:44:08.28 --> 00:44:16.52
ridge we had been defeated our losses were heavy my Patuna loan suffered seven casualties four

478
00:44:16.52 --> 00:44:25.24
killed Reynolds Bell Cuss and private Robert Cuss three wounded PFC James Harris

479
00:44:25.24 --> 00:44:31.64
private burnt Mick Bernie and private named Mandraville total casualties for first

480
00:44:31.64 --> 00:44:36.92
Patallian were nine killed and 23 wounded overall in the period spanning 18 to 23

481
00:44:36.92 --> 00:44:48.20
November the 8th Marines lost 42 men killed and many more wounded now do I you got in the

482
00:44:48.20 --> 00:44:55.24
part where a discurory escort was named after Mickoy Reynolds oh I did not know that well let me tell

483
00:44:55.24 --> 00:45:03.48
you about that yeah my company commander had been a journalist with a with a anorland's paper

484
00:45:03.48 --> 00:45:09.32
so he's good at writing up things so I recommended recommended something written up on him he wrote

485
00:45:09.32 --> 00:45:15.32
this up in such a matter that a destroyer escort was named after him that's called in McOed Reynolds

486
00:45:15.32 --> 00:45:25.24
and it in turn sank to Japanese submarines later on yeah and was that um was that captain LeBlanc

487
00:45:25.24 --> 00:45:31.64
that you're talking about yes it is so so captain LeBlanc was your company commander at that time

488
00:45:31.64 --> 00:45:38.04
and it sounds like it sounds like from the book well let me give you your your thoughts on him

489
00:45:38.04 --> 00:45:42.44
we called him little Napoleon he was notoriously eager to make a name for himself and just as

490
00:45:42.44 --> 00:45:49.000
notorious not just as notoriously a verse to taking risks his men took the risks and he took the

491
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.88
credit for their success he would say come on we've got a tough job to do and then he decides

492
00:45:53.88 --> 00:45:57.96
someone else to do it sometimes he denounced that we were going on an out on a reconnaissance

493
00:45:57.96 --> 00:46:02.28
platoon and then he turned a Murdoch or me or one of the other junior officers and say hey how about

494
00:46:02.28 --> 00:46:11.96
you leading it and at one point he tells you to go back to the go back to the army this is

495
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:17.32
a secret is darn thing you can imagine you're reading now he he's telling you to go back to the

496
00:46:17.32 --> 00:46:23.48
army and tell them what you know what the ethical proposition and they ran into the same

497
00:46:23.48 --> 00:46:29.72
stuff that we did or and they really ran into it really bad so he tells you to go and this is

498
00:46:29.72 --> 00:46:34.20
what you this is what you write I come all across the ridges east facing slope walking in the

499
00:46:34.20 --> 00:46:38.28
grass at the edge of the jungle I was beneath the crests and felt reasonably safe the area was

500
00:46:38.28 --> 00:46:44.36
deserted a true nomans land I found this very disconserting it was eerie so you're alone

501
00:46:44.36 --> 00:46:51.64
I'm stupid stupid then I came upon the body of an American soldier he lay slightly above me

502
00:46:51.64 --> 00:46:56.76
and to my right a stride a narrow trail leading to the top rich his abdomen had been torn open

503
00:46:56.76 --> 00:47:01.72
and his intestines had spilled out and were spread across the ground a grizzly and heart-rending

504
00:47:01.72 --> 00:47:10.20
sight I heard past him thinking I wonder what his dreams were will that happen to me now he was

505
00:47:10.20 --> 00:47:16.68
looking at a photograph do you talk about that there no okay he's now he the last thing

506
00:47:16.68 --> 00:47:22.84
for a died he's looking at a photograph of his family or his girlfriend is laid out there that's

507
00:47:22.84 --> 00:47:31.96
the last the last as dying as he's dying he was looking at that and you're thinking I wonder what

508
00:47:31.96 --> 00:47:36.36
his next would have been me that could be me will that happen to me well that happened yet because

509
00:47:36.36 --> 00:47:43.24
there's you still have a lot of danger here there's still snipers out there shooting at me at this time

510
00:47:44.92 --> 00:47:50.04
and now you go I arrived at the army cp to find it in turmoil and anxious captain and is

511
00:47:50.04 --> 00:47:55.88
visibly agitated staff stood around a field radio listening to a report from the front line emanating

512
00:47:55.88 --> 00:48:00.76
from the speaker where the sounds of battle mix with the crackling of static a frightened voice crying

513
00:48:00.76 --> 00:48:06.92
out we're taking a lot of fire put two liter hit leg blown off get us out of here

514
00:48:08.28 --> 00:48:13.24
I could hear the actual sounds of the battle outside not too far away machine guns rifle fire

515
00:48:13.24 --> 00:48:18.04
grenades mortars the usual mayhem I reported to the commanding officer and told him what I knew

516
00:48:18.04 --> 00:48:25.16
and I left the cp laid out close by where's many as a dozen bodies covered with ponchos I

517
00:48:25.16 --> 00:48:28.92
hurried on instead of staying low on the slope I headed over toward the top of the ridge I don't

518
00:48:28.92 --> 00:48:33.96
he was interested in hearing me he's already in a so darn deep he didn't care about any more

519
00:48:33.96 --> 00:48:40.28
detail see he knew he was in a over his hand yeah it's old information met this point yeah

520
00:48:43.32 --> 00:48:47.40
when I reached the top of the ridge I snuck my head I stuck my head over the crest in the next

521
00:48:47.40 --> 00:48:51.48
incident Japanese machine gun cut loose at me with a long burst sending a streamable

522
00:48:51.48 --> 00:48:56.60
it's snapping just inches above the head that brought me to my senses and I ran down the slope

523
00:48:56.60 --> 00:49:01.96
into the jungle I stood there for a minute grap gasping for breath shaking and thinking holy smokes

524
00:49:01.96 --> 00:49:05.16
almost bought the farm on that one holy smokes

525
00:49:05.16 --> 00:49:17.96
that count is one of your close calls micro close yeah yeah that's what I'm now you've already

526
00:49:17.96 --> 00:49:26.04
covered two of them now two out of eight there's actually there's there's three more on Guadalcanale

527
00:49:26.04 --> 00:49:31.24
that you'll get to in a subiet well what do they say a cat has nine lives so luckily we only have

528
00:49:31.24 --> 00:49:39.000
eight to cover otherwise the ninth one we wouldn't be here since it's here talking on November 25th

529
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.000
we were pulled off the line in sent to positions near in the rear near Hendersonfield for the next

530
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.12
15 days we slept in open sighted tents on the grove of coconut palms on ground that was

531
00:49:50.12 --> 00:49:55.48
saw from frequent heavy rain showers there was always a possibility that Japanese warships

532
00:49:55.48 --> 00:50:01.64
would foray and to see large channel during the night and throw a few hundred large cowlblows shells

533
00:50:02.28 --> 00:50:06.92
into our soggy environments but these dangers were negligible compared to what we had recently

534
00:50:06.92 --> 00:50:10.92
been through on the front line and we did not worry about them actually we did not worry about

535
00:50:10.92 --> 00:50:16.76
much of anything we were emotionally and physically drained and lacked both energy and inclination

536
00:50:16.76 --> 00:50:22.76
to worry we mostly sat around doing nothing partly because we had nothing much to do but also

537
00:50:22.76 --> 00:50:28.44
because we were sort of in a days you might say we were numb it was not it was not an unpleasant

538
00:50:28.44 --> 00:50:33.64
state we were purely glad to be alive and the fact that no one was shooting at us at least not

539
00:50:33.64 --> 00:50:39.88
directly or intentionally made us feel downright you fork we were living for the moment and for the moment

540
00:50:39.88 --> 00:50:46.12
everything was fine and we were content see now we're coming down with malaria as well you see

541
00:50:46.12 --> 00:50:52.84
now the other thing you go into here which is interesting is during this period of number

542
00:50:52.84 --> 00:50:58.04
Marines took steps to upgrade their personal armament the main object of their desire was the

543
00:50:58.04 --> 00:51:04.92
superb M1 grand semi-automatic rifle that had been issued to the army this still had the old ones

544
00:51:04.92 --> 00:51:11.16
the model 1903 springfield we carried was a fine weapon but it was obsolete the old salts loved

545
00:51:11.16 --> 00:51:16.92
the O3 like a Viking loves his broad sword but the kids were unsend metal about the rifle because

546
00:51:16.92 --> 00:51:23.000
they had no history with it so you say while some Marines acquired their M1s through honest

547
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.04
scrounging in battlefield scavenging others resorted to outright theft and you go through some

548
00:51:30.04 --> 00:51:36.20
methods that that were used to do that who is also moonlighting you guys had Tommy Guns

549
00:51:36.20 --> 00:51:42.44
which you said weren't really all that great for most of the purposes the rising

550
00:51:42.44 --> 00:51:53.16
you know for a while we even had shotgun you know yeah on the night of 30 to 31 November

551
00:51:53.16 --> 00:51:59.32
at Japanese beginning the beginning using the flame source as well is there too at that time

552
00:51:59.32 --> 00:52:09.24
rough weapon right there oh yeah on the night of 30 to 31 November a Japanese task force

553
00:52:09.24 --> 00:52:13.40
steamed in the sea large channel of bringing food to the Belieger Japanese forces on Guadalcanal

554
00:52:13.40 --> 00:52:18.52
our warships sailed forth to intercept it meeting the enemy fleet in that off-to-speweded gap

555
00:52:18.52 --> 00:52:23.72
between savvoiled and Guadalcanal just off Tassa Farango how do you say that it's right

556
00:52:23.72 --> 00:52:29.40
Tassa Farango point because our Bivolac was situated inland on low ground I heard the battle but

557
00:52:29.40 --> 00:52:35.40
did not see it our fleet took an awful beating one of our heavy cruisers the North Hampton was

558
00:52:35.40 --> 00:52:41.16
struck by two torpedoes within a matter of seconds consumed by fire she sank a few hours later

559
00:52:41.16 --> 00:52:47.96
you're still sure the heavy crew cruisers Minneapolis Minneapolis New Orleans and Pensacola

560
00:52:47.96 --> 00:52:52.84
were severely damaged and the sailors were coming off off of an off cover with oil

561
00:52:52.84 --> 00:52:57.000
and so would they swim into shore some did probably did it was right near the shore

562
00:52:58.20 --> 00:53:05.40
yeah the battle had been a clear tactical victory for the Japanese but a strategic defeat

563
00:53:05.40 --> 00:53:10.20
the task force had failed with its primary mission to deliver food to the Japanese army on Guadalcanal

564
00:53:11.40 --> 00:53:17.24
this was a calamitous development for the Japanese even before the battle their food stocks were

565
00:53:17.24 --> 00:53:23.08
desperately not low now they began falling below substance levels the entire enemy army was

566
00:53:23.08 --> 00:53:27.08
growing physically weaker because the soldiers simply didn't have enough to eat

567
00:53:29.16 --> 00:53:33.48
we were in better shape than the Japanese overall but only in a relative sense the first marine

568
00:53:33.48 --> 00:53:40.76
division in particular was greatly reduced by illness and sheer exhaustion as well as by battle casualties

569
00:53:40.76 --> 00:53:46.36
it had suffered in four months of fighting yeah a large number of its men were unfit for duty

570
00:53:46.36 --> 00:53:50.60
and many more were only marginally capable of rendering effective frontline service the

571
00:53:50.60 --> 00:53:54.60
high command recognizing that the entire division had just about reached the end of its

572
00:53:54.60 --> 00:53:59.32
operation utility pulled it off the front lines began sending it units to Australia starting on nine

573
00:53:59.32 --> 00:54:07.88
December yeah so they after my birthday December it's so you wave goodbye to those guys as they're

574
00:54:07.88 --> 00:54:14.84
leaving and meanwhile on 11 December the 8th marine's resume returned to the ridges yeah right

575
00:54:14.84 --> 00:54:19.48
but we didn't really take off until first part of the January I guess and the final drive

576
00:54:20.60 --> 00:54:25.64
and then so it's you on one set of ridges and the Japanese were on the other side they were usually

577
00:54:25.64 --> 00:54:31.72
somewhere right on the first slope in front of us they were dug in like gulfers like gulfer holes

578
00:54:32.92 --> 00:54:39.16
but most are more further back on the next over the next next ridge so there'd be you on one

579
00:54:39.16 --> 00:54:47.000
day they would come up close no so hang on a zed us heard so hang on a zed each other all right

580
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.60
these dispositions meaning these two ridges that you guys had occupied both ours and those

581
00:54:52.60 --> 00:54:59.000
the enemy remained substantially unchanged for the next 34 days yeah the brass anxious to void

582
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.72
a repeat performance of the november battles in order to temporary halt to large scale offensive

583
00:55:03.72 --> 00:55:08.52
operations instead we were told to hold the line and harass the enemy with aggressive patrols and

584
00:55:08.52 --> 00:55:15.24
raids in the meantime our air and naval forces would strive to introduce the Tokyo Express which is

585
00:55:15.24 --> 00:55:22.68
their supply chain now while we were at that location there was a sergeant from the Jason company

586
00:55:23.56 --> 00:55:29.08
and he had a tummy gun and he didn't enough at enough action going on where he was

587
00:55:29.08 --> 00:55:33.56
steady was coming down the line where there's air reaction he wanted to get into it well he came

588
00:55:33.56 --> 00:55:40.44
he came right by where I was and no one in two months when great was right shortly after that one

589
00:55:40.44 --> 00:55:48.92
of our one of our rounds dropped in short he lost two legs in an arm and he was in there's

590
00:55:48.92 --> 00:55:53.80
an article in the said reading post about it and saying that at least I have the right arm to

591
00:55:53.80 --> 00:55:59.64
wrap the bar with for a drink I'll tell about it and there's some too

592
00:55:59.64 --> 00:56:07.40
words uh you guys that during this you also talk about the fact that you would be young

593
00:56:07.40 --> 00:56:13.000
stuff back and forth to the Japanese they're a little bit a little bit they'd be yelling at you

594
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.80
guys and you'd yell back at them and it sounds like during the daytime well you say it was during

595
00:56:17.80 --> 00:56:24.36
the daytime was a policy became one of live and let live during the day of a much different policy

596
00:56:24.36 --> 00:56:29.24
ruled at night after the case yeah and they were sneaking in on the server now and then make a little

597
00:56:30.52 --> 00:56:36.92
trying to sneak in and maybe get one of our guys in a fox hole yeah you're going to one of those

598
00:56:36.92 --> 00:56:41.96
one night during a heavy downport of Japanese crept up from the ravines the sound of their movement

599
00:56:41.96 --> 00:56:47.16
mass by the falling rain and jump the crew a ferocious hand-a-hand struggle ensued I heard our

600
00:56:47.16 --> 00:56:53.72
men yelling help oh god they're in our whole help help they're blood curling cries and thrashing sounds

601
00:56:53.72 --> 00:56:57.88
were plainly audible to everyone in the vicinity there were on a point little bit a little bit

602
00:56:57.88 --> 00:57:03.64
a head of our regular line and this has gotta be just this is on a mental weedless and

603
00:57:03.64 --> 00:57:08.28
horrified but stayed in our holes that's how bad it was to get out of your holes you don't dare

604
00:57:08.28 --> 00:57:17.08
because you you anybody outside the holes enemy suddenly the yelling sounds of the fighting

605
00:57:17.08 --> 00:57:20.92
ceased we actually waited and listened to pairing through the rain and into the darkness

606
00:57:20.92 --> 00:57:24.36
then the Japanese begin probing our position all up and down the line running up to the

607
00:57:24.36 --> 00:57:28.84
crest and chucking a few grenades over the top at our holes and running back down hill after

608
00:57:28.84 --> 00:57:33.000
the grenades exploded usually harmlessly our guys would leap from their holes dashed to the

609
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.92
crest and throw grenades at the fleeting enemy then they'd scamper back to their holes and the

610
00:57:36.92 --> 00:57:40.76
Japanese would return to herle their grenades back and forth and went through the night intervals

611
00:57:40.76 --> 00:57:45.48
of silence and then flash bang of grenades exploding and men hollering and cursing in the English and

612
00:57:45.48 --> 00:57:50.28
Japanese the next morning we discovered that one of them men in the machine gun post had been killed

613
00:57:50.28 --> 00:57:54.84
that's that day and headed to death the others have been wounded but somehow they'd beaten back

614
00:57:54.84 --> 00:58:03.16
their attackers and you were saying this earlier you we also conducted aggressive patrols

615
00:58:03.16 --> 00:58:07.96
and probe their lines at giving as good as we got or maybe even better if more frontline

616
00:58:07.96 --> 00:58:12.12
Japanese soldiers had survived the war maybe be reading memoirs by those veterans of

617
00:58:12.12 --> 00:58:17.56
Guadalcanal campaign recounting how the US Marines terrorized them at night and terrorized

618
00:58:17.56 --> 00:58:23.000
them we most certainly did some guys really enjoyed this part of the job teenagers who found

619
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.40
their true nature in the jungle who discovered that they were born for the warrior life

620
00:58:27.40 --> 00:58:32.92
there were very there were a few in every unit more than a few actually more than you might expect

621
00:58:32.92 --> 00:58:37.96
more than I expected they went after the Japanese with a competence and enthusiasm that made

622
00:58:37.96 --> 00:58:42.68
them almost as frightening to their officers as they must have been to their enemies it was just

623
00:58:42.68 --> 00:58:48.12
amazing observed Murdoch how you could take kids like these and put them out into the jungle

624
00:58:48.12 --> 00:58:52.76
and in just a few weeks they'd be great at jungle warfare for them it was like playing cowboys and

625
00:58:52.76 --> 00:58:57.08
Indians they'd come back from a patrol and you'd hear them talk how many teeth did you get

626
00:58:57.08 --> 00:59:05.88
or how many did you kill and they'd brag while I killed three or four now I wanted these patrols

627
00:59:06.52 --> 00:59:10.84
much earlier than what we're talking about right now I was leading this patrol and had four

628
00:59:10.84 --> 00:59:18.84
five others with me and we ended up we were in a location where the army had now passed through

629
00:59:18.84 --> 00:59:27.16
our lines and they were in control so we came right by the reddish metal regimental CP and the

630
00:59:27.16 --> 00:59:31.72
army colonel says what do you guys doing here said well we got it with constant patrols as

631
00:59:31.72 --> 00:59:40.76
well we're in charge here now we don't need you any more and so we said so the we moved

632
00:59:40.76 --> 00:59:47.16
on for a little bit further back to our own line where we were in reserve and it turned out

633
00:59:47.16 --> 00:59:51.80
we had a little bit higher than we was so he'd look up at us and we were on the skyline from

634
00:59:51.80 --> 00:59:56.76
his from his perspective very skyline and then we would at peace of well you're going to track

635
00:59:56.76 --> 01:00:04.20
fire being up there well here's parsley crack but not entirely well anyway as we as we

636
01:00:04.20 --> 01:00:12.36
left my man says say they're they're two or three snipers in a tree right over there C.P.

637
01:00:12.36 --> 01:00:18.44
what should we do I said shoot them so we shot them killed them and and told the Colonel

638
01:00:18.44 --> 01:00:21.96
he just shot three snipers right over here C.P.

639
01:00:25.96 --> 01:00:32.68
and later on later on I'm and we return in 1982 there's a there's a big Catholic church right

640
01:00:32.68 --> 01:00:40.52
there now and I talked to the to the not a priest when next went up who's there and I

641
01:00:40.52 --> 01:00:49.16
tell him about it and then that same later on that same day well he so he he's the one

642
01:00:49.80 --> 01:00:56.20
as a young as a young priest he's the one that rescued Joel Foss when he got shut down

643
01:00:56.76 --> 01:01:00.04
I've gotten the water and he's all tangled up in his fairs who've never been out

644
01:01:00.04 --> 01:01:07.24
to tell him about it well later on that day we saw we saw Joel Foss and then in here he met

645
01:01:07.24 --> 01:01:16.60
he met this priest you know and he was talking about it and so anyway what's interesting is that

646
01:01:17.64 --> 01:01:24.60
when they told us this army Colonel what we had just done the Colonel was still unhappy with us

647
01:01:24.60 --> 01:01:33.08
and and and at the same reunion when we saw Joel Foss and all there was there was a

648
01:01:34.36 --> 01:01:41.64
veteran army who had previously had been a Marine in China and he joined the National Guard

649
01:01:41.64 --> 01:01:46.52
and that's where he was out there this time and he came to me he says you know

650
01:01:46.52 --> 01:01:55.56
I just heard you talking I was there and you had a beard like Santa Claus and it says you were there yeah

651
01:01:56.12 --> 01:02:00.76
and that says after you left I told the Colonel says you know after all we're on the same side

652
01:02:03.08 --> 01:02:10.92
a small world yeah that's crazy after all these years you know we talked a little bit about

653
01:02:10.92 --> 01:02:20.76
about Murdoch and and he's quite the character and you talk about him a little bit here

654
01:02:22.68 --> 01:02:29.56
because captain what happened to Captain of the block you get somehow somehow Murdoch ends up taking over

655
01:02:30.76 --> 01:02:36.04
eventually the block was relieved and replaced by Murdoch who's an ideal a Boston Irishman

656
01:02:36.04 --> 01:02:43.40
Murdoch was very funny and very tough a superb combat a superb combat commander and a bit wild too

657
01:02:43.40 --> 01:02:48.68
all traits that is younger charges greatly appreciated one manifestation of his toughness apart from his

658
01:02:48.68 --> 01:02:54.20
courage and coolness under fire was his disdain for metals and combinations very few men who had

659
01:02:54.20 --> 01:03:01.40
him as their CEO including me received decorations Murdoch explained I didn't recommend many people

660
01:03:01.40 --> 01:03:05.08
I didn't care if a machine gunner killed 50 men that's what he was supposed to do that's what he's

661
01:03:05.08 --> 01:03:10.20
getting paid for that was my attitude once in Hawaii we had a big for the formation with the

662
01:03:10.20 --> 01:03:16.44
division and they decorated all these guys one company would give 40 metals out I'd give one my attitude

663
01:03:16.44 --> 01:03:26.52
was hey killing japs is our job we're not doing it for metals yeah and here here you start to talk

664
01:03:26.52 --> 01:03:34.36
about just the whole just the the brutality of what's going on over there one of the themes

665
01:03:34.36 --> 01:03:39.48
running through the preceding anecdotes is the merciless nature of the Pacific war the Marine

666
01:03:39.48 --> 01:03:44.68
court had tried to prepare us for this in our training bayonet drills were especially important

667
01:03:44.68 --> 01:03:51.96
in reality in combat there to be aggressive you see right right yeah in reality in combat there are

668
01:03:51.96 --> 01:03:57.48
few instances when men used bayonets in the traditional manner fixed to the rifles bayonet drills

669
01:03:57.48 --> 01:04:03.40
were performed for their psychological effect so that men would learn the psychology of the bayonet

670
01:04:03.40 --> 01:04:09.72
namely to kill brutally quickly and unthinkingly without compunction or moral qualms so

671
01:04:09.72 --> 01:04:15.80
done realistic as far as the application right but our training merely paved the way for our

672
01:04:15.80 --> 01:04:23.08
transformation into hardened killers exposure to actual combat accomplished and completed the

673
01:04:23.08 --> 01:04:30.52
process you got hard or you died it was that simple killer be a killer be killed you know

674
01:04:30.52 --> 01:04:37.32
and the Japanese made it simple they were they were notoriously unspearing their reputation

675
01:04:37.32 --> 01:04:43.40
for ruthlessness and savagery was widespread and well-founded we knew all the stories the rape of

676
01:04:43.40 --> 01:04:49.40
Nand King the Badan death marks atrocities committed far and wide and often against prisoners

677
01:04:49.40 --> 01:04:54.60
we believed correctly that we could expect no pity if we fell into their hands they neither

678
01:04:54.60 --> 01:05:00.84
asked for quarter nor gave any and we responded in kind if they had set rules as we believed

679
01:05:00.84 --> 01:05:06.20
we were damn sure going to play by them one other choice do we have they simply would not

680
01:05:06.20 --> 01:05:11.08
surrender they would not stop coming out us until we killed them very quickly we learned that

681
01:05:11.08 --> 01:05:16.68
trying to take prisoners was a waste of time and dangerous even the wounded if we went to treat them

682
01:05:16.68 --> 01:05:21.24
would try and kill us by usually by blowing up everyone themselves and the corpsmen who had

683
01:05:21.24 --> 01:05:26.52
stopped to help them with a grenade the dead had a nasty habit of rising up from the ground

684
01:05:26.52 --> 01:05:33.16
and attacking us so we made sure the dead were truly dead no sense in taking chances this killer

685
01:05:33.16 --> 01:05:39.24
be killed approach to war was as brutalizing as it was brutal and affected everyone to some degree

686
01:05:39.96 --> 01:05:44.60
Murdock recalled a corpsman who came up to me and said hey lieutenant I've got well I've got

687
01:05:44.60 --> 01:05:48.84
a live one can I shoot him I said sure go ahead corpsman won't want to want to

688
01:05:48.84 --> 01:05:53.48
expose to have weapons and we shouldn't have shot that wounded guy but I let him do it

689
01:05:54.04 --> 01:05:58.76
we all we all did it all the time because if we took a prisoner it would take two men at least

690
01:05:58.76 --> 01:06:03.32
to send him back to the rear and we were so thin our lines were really thin because we had a lot of

691
01:06:03.32 --> 01:06:10.60
guy's sick our units were very much depleted thus we became inert to the horrors of war and not

692
01:06:10.60 --> 01:06:17.72
surprisingly we did horrible things not without reason when your enemy behaves in a beastial fashion

693
01:06:17.72 --> 01:06:24.76
it is only natural to look on them as beasts natural and to some extent justify or they consider

694
01:06:24.76 --> 01:06:34.36
his animals really but we were not without sin in this regard far from it Murdock for example

695
01:06:34.36 --> 01:06:40.44
never took any prisoners and here's Murdock I wasn't nice I did bad things looking back over the

696
01:06:40.44 --> 01:06:44.84
years I can say we probably committed as many atrocities against the dead bodies of the Japanese

697
01:06:44.84 --> 01:06:53.08
as they did to ours pulling teeth for example goal for example we'd heard japs wanted to die looking

698
01:06:53.08 --> 01:06:57.16
at the sun so we'd rolled them over and stick their faces in the dirt so we couldn't so they

699
01:06:57.16 --> 01:07:01.64
couldn't see the sun our guys would cut off fingers and make fobs which believe are not with

700
01:07:01.64 --> 01:07:07.000
the finger of the japs finger hanging down and they'd go out there with the knives and pliers

701
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.16
trying to pull out gold teeth but if some of us truly relished but if some of them men truly relished

702
01:07:15.16 --> 01:07:21.96
battle embraced and enjoyed it enjoyed the killing the brutality the horror all of it it is important

703
01:07:21.96 --> 01:07:29.08
to establish that on the continuum of brutal human behavior the rest of us were not all that far

704
01:07:29.08 --> 01:07:35.08
removed from them and we tended to move closer as the war went on some manner more capable than

705
01:07:35.08 --> 01:07:42.12
others when it comes to killing but all men are capable one way we improved on this capability

706
01:07:42.12 --> 01:07:48.20
such improvement being vital to our effectiveness as Marines not to mention our very survival

707
01:07:48.20 --> 01:07:53.56
was to look on our enemy as hateful creatures less than human from a psychological standpoint

708
01:07:53.56 --> 01:07:58.52
it became easy to kill them we were killing animals not men and after killing them we would look

709
01:07:58.52 --> 01:08:05.56
upon their dead bodies and feel nothing no remorse no guilt no horror pity or whatever from there

710
01:08:05.56 --> 01:08:12.04
it was just a small step to place in the geography of the mind we were pulling gold teeth out

711
01:08:12.04 --> 01:08:18.04
of corpses was not all that outrageous but now many were doing that there's just a few crazy guys

712
01:08:18.04 --> 01:08:24.60
doing it and one of my one of my sergeants that did that and he had a whole had a whole pocket full

713
01:08:24.60 --> 01:08:29.48
and for some reason rather something happy changes fans or something and they were all so

714
01:08:29.48 --> 01:08:37.96
I'll get some more yeah I like the fact that you said basically that I mean somebody asked me

715
01:08:37.96 --> 01:08:43.16
about dehumanizing the enemy and when we were fighting and I rack and I said the enemy dehumanizes

716
01:08:43.16 --> 01:08:49.08
themselves with their what their actions that they would take and that's the same situation here

717
01:08:49.08 --> 01:08:57.000
you know the in Iraq the insurgents would be head people and skin people alive and just do

718
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.80
absolutely horrible I don't know what the Turks seem to be doing that right now it seems like I don't

719
01:09:01.80 --> 01:09:09.08
know that's a thing cleansing yeah there's definitely some uh it's hard to figure out what's going on

720
01:09:09.08 --> 01:09:20.12
over there right now I saw some fresh reports of what going on in the absolute yeah it does not look good you

721
01:09:20.12 --> 01:09:23.88
also had some people that couldn't that didn't adopt that mentality and here's Murdoch talking

722
01:09:23.88 --> 01:09:30.92
about it talking about people that couldn't adopt that killer be killed mentality he said they'd

723
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:35.40
have to go back because they were no good to us they just disappear they'd be sent back to the

724
01:09:35.40 --> 01:09:39.80
states it was a self-weeding process the guys who remained were the guys you could depend on

725
01:09:40.36 --> 01:09:45.64
when I became company commander New Zealand that was an awful thing I had to do we could send

726
01:09:45.64 --> 01:09:50.76
3% of our personnel home every so often so they could start new outfits back in the states

727
01:09:50.76 --> 01:09:55.80
but you never wanted to send the good guys home you send the shitheads and the screwups I wanted

728
01:09:55.80 --> 01:10:01.48
the best men with me I didn't want any of my good men to go in New Zealand just before we sailed

729
01:10:01.48 --> 01:10:07.88
for Talawa Tarawa Murdoch told our company now listen I'm gonna send some of you guys home if you

730
01:10:07.88 --> 01:10:13.96
fuck up you're going to go but he told me later these kids were so good they just wouldn't do that

731
01:10:13.96 --> 01:10:18.60
they wouldn't fuck up on purpose they would do their job and do it well they didn't want to be

732
01:10:18.60 --> 01:10:23.64
come known as a fuck up and a lot of those kids were killed on Talawa that I could have sent home

733
01:10:24.68 --> 01:10:29.96
but that's what happened because I wanted to keep the good guys with me man that's a powerful

734
01:10:29.96 --> 01:10:36.20
statement all these guys have to do is be slackers and they'll get sent home to the states but they

735
01:10:36.20 --> 01:10:45.08
wouldn't do it that's the Marine Corps. The thing is this isn't a general average opinion I don't think

736
01:10:45.56 --> 01:10:52.60
he was a little bit overboard and all this discussion you know he's not difficult in other words

737
01:10:52.60 --> 01:10:58.68
but he was he was well-liked because of because of when he looked at life

738
01:10:58.68 --> 01:11:04.68
yeah he talks about one guy here he says I had one guy a platoon a lieutenant platoon leader will call him

739
01:11:04.68 --> 01:11:10.52
Mac. Yeah not as real names. That's the one I took over from and then where I almost got killed.

740
01:11:10.52 --> 01:11:15.48
He says he was a Yale graduate came from Connecticut very well brought up had money nice guy too

741
01:11:15.48 --> 01:11:20.68
and handsome a rugged look good looking Marine but on Guadalcanal he'd go on patrol he just could not handle it

742
01:11:21.48 --> 01:11:26.76
while he'd go bean yes was his platoon sergeant and he'd have to take over Mac's patrols all the time

743
01:11:26.76 --> 01:11:32.28
Mac tried but he couldn't do it I respected him for that he was trying the kids were calling him yellow

744
01:11:32.28 --> 01:11:37.24
and they'd say to me we don't want that guy he's yellow and I'd say wait just a minute that guy is not

745
01:11:37.24 --> 01:11:42.12
yellow he tried to do the job but he's just not he couldn't just couldn't do it just going to

746
01:11:42.92 --> 01:11:48.12
a yellow man doesn't go out and try he quits Mac won't go this go deenia see became an officer

747
01:11:48.12 --> 01:11:59.72
he married an anus elin gal I knew him pretty well all right so continuing on here by December

748
01:11:59.72 --> 01:12:04.44
our long so during the front line of taking a big toll we were wasted by illness multiple illnesses

749
01:12:04.44 --> 01:12:09.64
we were malnourished and looked it we went about shirtless showing squannie bodies with protruding ribs

750
01:12:09.64 --> 01:12:14.28
and vertebrae and salose skin stretched over stretched hotly over them our faces were drawn

751
01:12:14.28 --> 01:12:19.24
in angular beneath scraggly beards and our eyes were recessed in their orbits we didn't have a

752
01:12:19.24 --> 01:12:24.04
change of clothes during that period and we became unimaginably filthy we looked scary and

753
01:12:24.04 --> 01:12:28.92
menacing and pitiful a lot of us came down with yellow jannus see that that would do a

754
01:12:28.92 --> 01:12:36.84
liberate that would do you and too you know the constant threat of enemy attack punctuated by

755
01:12:36.84 --> 01:12:41.32
intermittent balance of actual fighting was tremendously stressful it seemed that much of the time

756
01:12:41.32 --> 01:12:46.84
we were either waiting to be attacked or being attacked or attacking the enemy ourselves or we were

757
01:12:46.84 --> 01:12:50.52
just sitting around trying to get some rest but feeling cruddy because we were sick and we always

758
01:12:50.52 --> 01:12:55.48
were tensed up thinking and worrying about our next combat action depending on how your day was going

759
01:12:55.48 --> 01:12:59.88
such concerns might be in the forefront of your thoughts incessant and acute making you all

760
01:12:59.88 --> 01:13:05.16
edgy and fretful or they might be buried deep usually they were somewhere in between but they were

761
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:09.48
always present in your head and on your mind you could never fully let go or get rid of them

762
01:13:09.48 --> 01:13:15.48
the unrelenting mental strain not to do not not to mention the physical dangers that caused it

763
01:13:15.48 --> 01:13:21.56
made us twitch your each passing day you know during the during the times that we were

764
01:13:22.12 --> 01:13:29.56
we were back behind the front lines and nobody's shooting at you home like I said it's wonderful

765
01:13:29.56 --> 01:13:37.24
nobody's shooting at me and all that stress you know now you now you don't have to worry about it

766
01:13:37.24 --> 01:13:42.76
now what about the fact that even though no one's shooting at you right now you have time to

767
01:13:42.76 --> 01:13:47.08
sit there and think about the fact that you're going to go again and the enemy's going to attack you

768
01:13:47.08 --> 01:13:52.12
and you know somebody pull up pull it what it was stupid thing so it's through a hand grenade

769
01:13:52.68 --> 01:13:59.64
dummy into a tent everybody just took off why would a guy do that I don't understand he thought it was funny

770
01:13:59.64 --> 01:14:06.92
I'll tell you why I'm laughing when you tell that story because one of my friends what

771
01:14:06.92 --> 01:14:12.04
am I good friends a guy by the name of Lave Babin who I work with and wrote a book with

772
01:14:12.60 --> 01:14:17.24
wrote two books with him actually he did that two a couple of his guys took a

773
01:14:17.24 --> 01:14:22.36
took a grenade and we were in Ramadi and he took a grenade the pin was in it was still taped up

774
01:14:22.36 --> 01:14:26.44
but it was real grenade and there was a couple of guys sitting in a room talking and he just opened

775
01:14:26.44 --> 01:14:31.88
the door and rolled the grenade in there we were just talking about the other day yeah oh yeah

776
01:14:31.88 --> 01:14:35.48
we were just talking about the reason I remember we were just talking about yesterday and he goes

777
01:14:35.48 --> 01:14:39.72
yeah that wasn't smart it wasn't smart because who knows what's going to happen I mean those guys

778
01:14:39.72 --> 01:14:43.96
it with they had guns they might have shot I mean there's all kinds of crazy things that couldn't happen

779
01:14:43.96 --> 01:14:50.76
you make it mean later on yet in here but also in our last drive on Guadalconelle I had

780
01:14:50.76 --> 01:14:56.52
an enemy grenade filled right there by my legs and I tried to kick it away and hit something came

781
01:14:56.52 --> 01:15:12.92
right on back it was a dud. Here's Murdoch talking about Guadalconelle and why what made it

782
01:15:13.88 --> 01:15:18.28
what made it Guadalconelle he said each campaign was different each with different problems

783
01:15:18.28 --> 01:15:22.76
Tar was the worst in terms of fighting but the battle lasted only three days right after it

784
01:15:23.48 --> 01:15:28.76
we right after it ended we were taken off Baycheo and sent back to Hawaii but on Guadalconelle

785
01:15:28.76 --> 01:15:32.92
we were on Guadalconelle for three months. For the amount of time we were there we didn't do

786
01:15:32.92 --> 01:15:37.08
all that much fighting but there were other things the sickness and the heat especially the

787
01:15:37.08 --> 01:15:42.92
living conditions were the worst on Guadalconelle and then you say as bad as it was it was worse

788
01:15:42.92 --> 01:15:47.88
for the Japanese much worse their condition was no mystery for us as December gave way to January

789
01:15:47.88 --> 01:15:53.96
there was a noticeable drop off an enemy activity that we correctly ascribed to their deteriorating

790
01:15:53.96 --> 01:15:59.000
health their nocturnal probes dwindled and in time virtually ceased altogether they simply

791
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:12.36
lacked the energy to come out us in the night. We didn't know they didn't even bother to yell at us

792
01:16:12.36 --> 01:16:17.40
they rarely achieved success when they did attack in battle we found we had as we been told on

793
01:16:17.40 --> 01:16:22.52
Simoa the Japanese made the same mistakes over and over for instance they would commit their units

794
01:16:22.52 --> 01:16:26.44
to battle as they became available instead of holding them back and massing them for a single

795
01:16:26.44 --> 01:16:31.40
powerful blow and they would keep coming in small coming out of until they were killed primarily

796
01:16:31.40 --> 01:16:36.12
by our artillery the carnage was sickening even to us weak and we couldn't understand why they

797
01:16:36.12 --> 01:16:41.16
never seemed to learn from their experiences and make the necessary adjustments. One one thing

798
01:16:41.16 --> 01:16:48.52
that was wrong with their strategy that they they had attacked and there was no command to change

799
01:16:48.52 --> 01:16:51.80
are you going to go out of flying or something like that to just keep coming and keep coming

800
01:16:51.80 --> 01:16:58.04
to other all kill. Yeah that's a lack of leadership and maneuver warfare right that's not

801
01:16:58.04 --> 01:17:01.88
no maneuver no maneuver at all no maneuver just hey we're going forward we're going to do a

802
01:17:01.88 --> 01:17:06.44
a frontal assault and they would just get killed to get mode down and that happened time and

803
01:17:06.44 --> 01:17:13.24
time again. Here we are coming in the terror law the same situation we had no no way to maneuver

804
01:17:13.24 --> 01:17:18.76
anything and just keep going into facing heavy machine gun fire just like the Japanese did.

805
01:17:20.20 --> 01:17:25.16
The Japanese thought their indelvinable will would provide them with a margin for victory it did

806
01:17:25.16 --> 01:17:30.44
not occur to them or they could not acknowledge that the Marines and soldiers they were battling

807
01:17:30.44 --> 01:17:37.96
were equally indelvinable and in the end victorious. They had so easy on moving all down through the

808
01:17:38.92 --> 01:17:45.72
the east end is not that and it's just everything just just faded away and they just kept going

809
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:53.56
no problem at all. And then they met American forces. So then so this is this is a turning point

810
01:17:53.56 --> 01:17:59.32
of going to go out and where they that's where they return the tables now where now we're in the offensive. Yeah

811
01:17:59.32 --> 01:18:07.72
do so January 10th you begin going on off. Eighth Marines the one eight the two eight and the

812
01:18:07.72 --> 01:18:13.72
three eight I worked with the three eight a bunch of your body they were outstanding. Yeah our mission orders

813
01:18:13.72 --> 01:18:19.24
issued by General Patch were to attack and destroy the Japanese format forces remaining on Guadalcanal.

814
01:18:19.24 --> 01:18:29.48
Yeah. We moved up and I'm just reading and I always have to mention this I'm obviously not reading

815
01:18:29.48 --> 01:18:35.16
this whole book. I could read this whole book. I want to read this whole book because the book is

816
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:39.64
outstanding but I'm jumping around so if it seems a little bit scattered it's because I'm jumping

817
01:18:39.64 --> 01:18:45.64
from I'm skipping over big chunks that you're telling with great detail and and this is this is one

818
01:18:45.64 --> 01:18:52.84
of the most outstanding accounts that exists of these campaigns. So just know that you have to buy

819
01:18:52.84 --> 01:18:59.000
the book the book is called Faith for Warriors. So here we go we moved we pushed on we moved up

820
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.96
and over hill 82 the hill and jungle draws below were in festo with Japanese my men saw a

821
01:19:03.96 --> 01:19:08.60
single Japanese soldier and open fire killing him instantly I collected some personal effects from

822
01:19:08.60 --> 01:19:14.68
his body a diary a lock of hair a first aid kit a photograph of a group of soldiers and a

823
01:19:14.68 --> 01:19:20.28
thousand stitch belt which is a piece of cloth embroidered with a thousand stitches by wellwishers

824
01:19:20.28 --> 01:19:25.16
that he carried for good luck. No I sent a lot of this stuff that we took off of the dead home

825
01:19:25.16 --> 01:19:30.84
to Japan to their to their families eventually. Eventually and we'll probably get into a bit but

826
01:19:31.56 --> 01:19:36.68
the I received a letter from the brother one of these soldiers just beautifully done calligraphy

827
01:19:36.68 --> 01:19:43.000
you know. Yeah so you you held on to this stuff and eventually figured out who this got

828
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.68
did that because we we were asked to talk to a Japanese in Los Angeles and there's a Japanese

829
01:19:50.68 --> 01:19:59.000
Japanese area there and the the the priest there suggested I do that he couldn't speak any

830
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.08
English but through the translation I knew that that's what had to do and so we sent it

831
01:20:05.08 --> 01:20:11.48
to the to the relatives of Philadelphia worked with at North American Aviation and

832
01:20:11.48 --> 01:20:19.48
his wife's family were Honda which is a Honda car and so we sent her to one of her cousins

833
01:20:20.20 --> 01:20:27.48
and when they they came to Fay baseball in this country after the war and they lost so they

834
01:20:27.48 --> 01:20:33.08
had lost face to so to speak so they wanted to go back with something so they took this all

835
01:20:33.08 --> 01:20:38.36
of these items that I'd taken off of these soldiers that we're talking about here and they put it

836
01:20:38.36 --> 01:20:45.80
in a white box strong around their neck as they got as they landed in Hawaii a lot of

837
01:20:45.80 --> 01:20:52.92
Buddhist priests were there with me to play when they got to Tokyo all a big thing always picked up

838
01:20:52.92 --> 01:21:02.52
and my name got all over all over Japan about over that incredible. What were you thinking about

839
01:21:02.52 --> 01:21:06.36
at the time I mean at the time you couldn't have been thinking about that all that was going

840
01:21:06.36 --> 01:21:13.48
to happen. You know and also you know where we we were asked to attend this Buddhist ceremony

841
01:21:14.20 --> 01:21:19.64
and my family had made three daughters with me and here we're the first ones in line and you're

842
01:21:19.64 --> 01:21:25.48
we're supposed to you're supposed to you had to carry these incense and there's a gong and

843
01:21:25.48 --> 01:21:33.48
goes on and well bunch of stuff we we led that procession as it went by then after that we we had a

844
01:21:33.48 --> 01:21:41.80
get together sokiyaki and and beer in the in the percentage yeah and I'd be real careful

845
01:21:41.80 --> 01:21:46.36
what I said you know I had my friend as a translator be real careful they didn't call them

846
01:21:46.36 --> 01:21:52.04
japs and all that yeah and I said how come come there's so interesting what happened here

847
01:21:52.04 --> 01:21:57.88
as well these these people from northern part of Japan and they had no clue of what had

848
01:21:57.88 --> 01:22:07.08
happened to their soldiers way down south yeah because they didn't have enough weightness is

849
01:22:07.08 --> 01:22:13.48
living after the war you know to explain and then on on site pan and I was talking to Donny

850
01:22:13.48 --> 01:22:18.52
Edwards we were there at you been there you know where this what this call suicide clip

851
01:22:18.52 --> 01:22:24.28
well there there's one monument there and there were paid for by children raising the money

852
01:22:24.28 --> 01:22:32.12
and one of them faces south kneeling a mother mourning over her lost her sons lost in the

853
01:22:32.12 --> 01:22:38.84
south city the other was facing the suicide cliff mourning the children that were carried over

854
01:22:38.84 --> 01:22:46.04
the cliff to be killed and what is happening was they were just putting in the new monument

855
01:22:46.04 --> 01:22:50.60
they hadn't don't have the new captions yet and I was explaining to Donny what that what that

856
01:22:50.60 --> 01:22:59.96
was all about and it's on it's it's on uh uh uh Instagram go to Instagram and you go to best

857
01:22:59.96 --> 01:23:08.28
defense foundation and they'll tell about it okay yeah so even though you're gathering souvenirs this

858
01:23:08.28 --> 01:23:13.80
is not over yet and here you go the fighting was constant but not everywhere at the same time one squad

859
01:23:13.80 --> 01:23:19.08
might be resting wall nearby another was engaged with a sharp fight yeah it's true with a sniper

860
01:23:19.08 --> 01:23:24.28
machine gunness and all up and down the line automatic weapons rattled rifles crack grenades

861
01:23:24.28 --> 01:23:30.04
popped the air carry this the stringent smell of cordite in places where there had been a lot of

862
01:23:30.04 --> 01:23:34.76
firing the atmosphere was hazy with gunsmoke and the smoke of burning foliage there was a lot of

863
01:23:34.76 --> 01:23:40.28
shouting someone screaming the and the frequent cry corpsman corpsman stretcher down this is not

864
01:23:40.28 --> 01:23:45.96
a general atmosphere this this is a certain locations this is happening because not here where you say

865
01:23:45.96 --> 01:23:49.72
yeah because then this is because the Japanese were really depleted at this point pretty much so yeah they

866
01:23:49.72 --> 01:23:56.76
will yeah uh stretcher bearers many of them musicians in the divisions band yeah right ran around

867
01:23:56.76 --> 01:24:02.04
the battlefield picking up the wounded and carrying them back the battalion aid station so every

868
01:24:02.04 --> 01:24:09.16
Marines arrive amen as well as there's the band out there there's the pressure pressure bearers

869
01:24:09.16 --> 01:24:16.76
yeah 14 January we continue to advance the action much the same as the day before

870
01:24:16.76 --> 01:24:20.36
intermittent class with Japanese diehard some of the Japanese we came upon

871
01:24:20.36 --> 01:24:24.20
blew themselves up and their holes were just sat there and let us kill them with the grenades

872
01:24:24.20 --> 01:24:31.08
yeah my puttune made good progress you got a guy named the blowing sounds up a little hand

873
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:36.84
grenade right here put he had it and kick it off and his team blown south up right over here

874
01:24:36.84 --> 01:24:43.32
so with they trying to take Marines with him not well yeah as they could but when you get

875
01:24:43.32 --> 01:24:47.96
in a side panel explain there how would we we saw a hundred over a hundred doing that as we

876
01:24:47.96 --> 01:24:52.52
advance and they could have shot back as they didn't instead they just we got so close

877
01:24:53.24 --> 01:25:00.76
and they blown themselves bang bang bang as we as we as we had passed incredible

878
01:25:00.76 --> 01:25:10.60
uh one guy you lost a guy named Gunner Lund and you with a gunner Lund had kind of a

879
01:25:11.16 --> 01:25:16.28
had a kid that looked up to him made her shall wheelcy and you and he wrote he's a

880
01:25:16.28 --> 01:25:22.84
one that did some of these illustrations okay and in this one here okay so wheel ski you're

881
01:25:22.84 --> 01:25:28.60
the one that has to tell wheel ski that you know his his he is no more he's no more and here we

882
01:25:28.60 --> 01:25:33.96
are shortly thereafter it fell upon me to break the news of Lund's death to corporal hercial

883
01:25:33.96 --> 01:25:39.56
wheel ski ski as he was known was a bar man and a squad leader in Lund's puttune yeah

884
01:25:39.56 --> 01:25:44.92
he took Lund's death very hard gunner Lund was a popular figure and B company an old salt

885
01:25:44.92 --> 01:25:49.32
who was trusted and respected for his courage competence and common sense battle wisdom

886
01:25:49.32 --> 01:25:53.96
and loved for his tough his rough humor and for the obvious and genuine affection

887
01:25:53.96 --> 01:25:58.20
and concerned he felt for his young charges before the war he had been sea going marine

888
01:25:58.20 --> 01:26:03.000
serving on the beloved aircraft the Lexington he'd always been smoking a cigar how

889
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.08
we was able to keep himself stock with stowies on guano canals anyone's guess such

890
01:26:07.08 --> 01:26:11.40
of the talents of an old salt he used to say that after the war he was going to buy himself a

891
01:26:11.40 --> 01:26:16.92
big shiny cattle act convertible and ride around smoking his cigars instead of that high

892
01:26:16.92 --> 01:26:22.92
visit his family after the war he had a sister that had been to a dance and they couldn't

893
01:26:22.92 --> 01:26:29.56
find her anywhere she was dead in the trunk they found her body in the trunk of the car

894
01:26:29.56 --> 01:26:35.64
been murdered and they got this this same time as hit as when he the family found out about Lund

895
01:26:35.64 --> 01:26:45.48
oh yeah you said that that was a simple dream for a simple very good man a dream never realized

896
01:26:46.28 --> 01:26:50.84
all the kids looked up to Lund wheel skiing particular ski idolized Lund the gunner was everything

897
01:26:50.84 --> 01:26:55.16
to him a hero mentor father figure older brother and best friend at first he refused to

898
01:26:55.16 --> 01:26:59.72
believe that Lund had been killed yeah i was just talking to him a few minutes ago he said

899
01:26:59.72 --> 01:27:04.04
but then the truth said again and he became distraught and threw his weapon on the ground this

900
01:27:04.04 --> 01:27:10.04
damn war he exclaimed yeah ski then announced he was quitting the marine core and quitting the war

901
01:27:10.04 --> 01:27:14.84
he meant what he said he was about to head back to the rear when Murdoch arrived on the scene

902
01:27:14.84 --> 01:27:19.32
Murdoch's calm ski down and told him that he just couldn't up and quit that it would be

903
01:27:19.32 --> 01:27:23.88
desertion in the face of the enemy and that he would get a lot of trouble for it Murdoch spoke

904
01:27:23.88 --> 01:27:29.64
softly with him for several minutes in this vein until ski came to a senses ski picked up as

905
01:27:29.64 --> 01:27:35.24
weapon and rejoined third platoon and Murdoch assumed command of that unit but ski was a changed man

906
01:27:35.88 --> 01:27:40.84
exchanging one man as for another he went from being a marine who did his job and did it well

907
01:27:40.84 --> 01:27:45.88
to being a marine who did his job with a singular passion from that day forward he hated the

908
01:27:45.88 --> 01:27:51.08
Japanese with a savage intensity and took it on himself to personally avenge Lund's death

909
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:55.96
often going off by himself to hunt the enemy if you were a compassionate man you might say a

910
01:27:55.96 --> 01:28:02.60
prayer for any Japanese soldiers who crossed his path he always returned eventually but with

911
01:28:02.60 --> 01:28:09.24
little to say about his exploits he was the quiet type guys like him usually are yeah

912
01:28:09.24 --> 01:28:20.60
he's the impediment he pedamy of a combat marine and so this continues on and then you say this

913
01:28:20.60 --> 01:28:24.84
and so to the end my memory of the final days of January offensive is blurry and I find it

914
01:28:24.84 --> 01:28:29.64
difficult to remember the details that reunions we reminisce about our very limited personnel

915
01:28:29.64 --> 01:28:34.84
personal perspective of the offense and the countless little battles that were fought as we went

916
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:41.56
forward at that perilous time we focused primarily on our own concerns about adequate cover for

917
01:28:41.56 --> 01:28:46.52
incoming artillery and other life threatening events in our immediate area we advanced on a broad

918
01:28:46.52 --> 01:28:51.000
front but never in an even line some units always move faster than others depending on the terrain

919
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.36
and the resistance they encountered we went up and down more hills and ridges up and down up and down

920
01:28:56.36 --> 01:29:02.92
sometimes fighting and killing the Japanese sometimes just killing them and to January or last week

921
01:29:02.92 --> 01:29:07.96
on guadal canal be company was bivalact by Henderson Field awaiting transport off the island while

922
01:29:07.96 --> 01:29:12.76
there I came down with jaundice and I lost a lot of weight I would be getting off the island just

923
01:29:12.76 --> 01:29:18.12
in time in the meantime there were no duties to perform some of them very on there's on the

924
01:29:18.12 --> 01:29:22.20
in the meantime there were still duties to perform in some of them very unpleasant one of Murdoch's

925
01:29:22.20 --> 01:29:27.16
responsibility was to record the location of the battle site graves on an overlay it troubled him

926
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:32.44
that the locations couldn't always be specifically pin-boinered so there was no so there could be no assurance

927
01:29:32.44 --> 01:29:37.48
that the bodies would later be found for relocation to permanent cemetery now regarding those bodies

928
01:29:38.28 --> 01:29:45.48
year or so go the organization that at locate bodies and get some buried all there and

929
01:29:46.68 --> 01:29:53.96
they're in hoi and on lilloo and they ran out of money but they were going to pay for me go down

930
01:29:53.96 --> 01:30:01.08
and help them locate these bodies we're talking about but the guy that he was he was a doctorate

931
01:30:01.08 --> 01:30:06.44
and he says I just I just ran out of legal room money wise couldn't do it

932
01:30:10.84 --> 01:30:18.12
so finally this is last year wow yeah well maybe we can raise some money for him

933
01:30:20.12 --> 01:30:25.40
this was a call cheap back and then it's now a new name they probably might say they were missed missed

934
01:30:25.40 --> 01:30:31.96
they were missed missed they were missed handling money there's many money where they shouldn't have

935
01:30:31.96 --> 01:30:37.64
been so a lot of those going on you probably heard about and then the new secretary fan came

936
01:30:37.64 --> 01:30:49.32
down he did he just changed the whole thing around so we wrapped this up the section on January

937
01:30:49.32 --> 01:30:55.48
on 31 January the one eight and the entire second regiment boarded the troop transport crescent city

938
01:30:55.48 --> 01:31:00.92
and then during the first week of February the Japanese managed to evacuate more than 11,000 troops

939
01:31:00.92 --> 01:31:07.24
a minor triumph that did little to offset the magnets you do there to feet they lost upward of 25,000 men

940
01:31:07.24 --> 01:31:13.000
in Guadalcanal campaign of these maybe a thousand were taken prisoner our losses were comparatively small

941
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:21.88
according to army historians about 1600 were killed and 4,245 were wounded on nine February the

942
01:31:21.88 --> 01:31:26.76
rest of the eighth Marines left Guadalcanal on board the troop ship hunter ligate at American

943
01:31:26.76 --> 01:31:34.52
Legion that same day Guadalcanal was declared secure one way or another for the living and the dead

944
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.72
the fighting on Guadalcanal was over forever

945
01:31:37.72 --> 01:31:54.60
so your next chapter here is called heaven yeah because from the hell of Guadalcanal you went to

946
01:31:54.60 --> 01:32:01.56
a place called New Zealand and this was quite the change for you all going from Guadalcanal

947
01:32:01.56 --> 01:32:09.88
to New Zealand no longer sweating jungles you you highlight some of the good things about

948
01:32:09.88 --> 01:32:14.28
New Zealand and then then you get to what apparently is the biggest highlight in New Zealand

949
01:32:14.28 --> 01:32:20.12
it says this there were girls holy smokes whether they're all gone but they were

950
01:32:20.92 --> 01:32:25.32
they were welcome here so for no because they're men were overfighting because they were

951
01:32:25.32 --> 01:32:31.40
in North Africa young girls pretty girls smiling girls they were everywhere lots of them

952
01:32:31.40 --> 01:32:38.28
my girl my girlfriend was 19 and not here I was I was approaching 23 he 22 she's still alive she's

953
01:32:38.28 --> 01:32:45.16
95 no wow can you imagine they stared at us and we stared at them and they smiled at us

954
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:50.28
and we smiled at them and in many instances we greeted each other and exchange pleasantries

955
01:32:50.28 --> 01:32:56.52
and actually conversed with them even the castanovas among us had a hard gov at at first

956
01:32:56.52 --> 01:33:00.44
it had been a long time since we had spoken with girls we were out of practice we were also

957
01:33:00.44 --> 01:33:05.64
gasey is the term you use staring inward a thousand yards back into our heads flashing on our

958
01:33:05.64 --> 01:33:11.40
thoughts and visions of Guadalcanal put in there our faces and what do you have for that

959
01:33:13.08 --> 01:33:15.16
just be just yeah just remembering yeah

960
01:33:15.16 --> 01:33:22.12
the contrast was immediately apparent profoundly jarring we had learned how to handle hell

961
01:33:22.68 --> 01:33:27.64
but heaven would take some getting used to a board ship we we hadn't been aware of our gasey

962
01:33:27.64 --> 01:33:33.48
conditioned we all seem normal to each other but here in this beautiful city among these wonderful

963
01:33:33.48 --> 01:33:38.84
civilized people among all those pretty girls it was possible to see how far from normal we were

964
01:33:38.84 --> 01:33:48.04
what would they think of us they loved us and we loved them right back so you guys I mean you

965
01:33:48.04 --> 01:33:53.000
do talk about some of the things that happened there and some of those adjustments getting into it

966
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000
and and then the kind of I guess the kind of mayhem and chaos that you were more dark himself

967
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.04
he there's one story about where where he come barging barging into the owner the woman owner

968
01:34:06.04 --> 01:34:15.88
the hotel where our her officers mess where the get together was and it tells about it in there

969
01:34:15.88 --> 01:34:23.56
yeah anyway he comes he called he crawled he was drunk no clothes on I guess and crawled along an

970
01:34:23.56 --> 01:34:29.24
edge and then wrapped on the window and she opened it up that I mean he ended up going then next morning

971
01:34:29.24 --> 01:34:38.52
woke up here's with us older woman and oh my gosh yes she says something like you know good

972
01:34:38.52 --> 01:34:42.92
morning he says did I have a good time or something like that but she said yes you did

973
01:34:44.52 --> 01:34:48.44
sounded like he she he was avoiding her for the rest of the time yeah yeah you

974
01:34:51.48 --> 01:34:57.72
all right to get back to the military side of this after a few weeks new Zealand we started

975
01:34:57.72 --> 01:35:02.60
training in earnest we we needed a lot of training both to get ourselves back into shape and incorporate

976
01:35:02.60 --> 01:35:07.48
replacements who are streaming in from the states our experience on Guadalcanal provided the template

977
01:35:07.48 --> 01:35:13.16
for our training we built positions on the Japanese model and practiced attacking them we advanced

978
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:17.64
through wooded areas against simulated sniper attacks we worked on the use of supporting fires

979
01:35:17.64 --> 01:35:23.000
and we worked with tanks one of the most important changes overall was to give the squad leaders

980
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.84
more freedom of action to make decisions in combat let them decide on their own how to maneuver

981
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:36.36
their men and move around to develop and any members I'm sure there's no room for maneuver

982
01:35:37.16 --> 01:35:44.28
no no no chance to use tanks but it's interesting you know we we talk a lot about

983
01:35:44.28 --> 01:35:47.56
kind of the principles of combat leadership and one of the most important principles of combat

984
01:35:47.56 --> 01:35:52.44
leadership is decentralized command and that is allowing your support and leaders to lead and that

985
01:35:52.44 --> 01:35:57.48
right there even the private say even a private say come on guys this going he pull them together

986
01:35:57.48 --> 01:36:02.12
let's go yeah and and you that's obviously you're taking that lesson that's it then you say

987
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:07.40
that's a change overall yeah you guys even you all realized hey we need our frontline troops to

988
01:36:07.40 --> 01:36:13.40
be able to lead yeah yeah I mentioned that when I I spoken to Marine Corps League you know

989
01:36:13.40 --> 01:36:18.12
the Marine Corps birthday balls know that and I mentioned that leadership aspect

990
01:36:18.12 --> 01:36:23.000
you're written books about two I know I have it's one of the things I talk about all the time

991
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.08
oh yeah and when I taught leadership inside the steel teams that's one of the main things I

992
01:36:27.08 --> 01:36:33.48
needed the young troopers to do who you would have been a disaster that had happened yeah

993
01:36:35.56 --> 01:36:40.28
so fast forward a bit through the you talk some more about that training and what it's like

994
01:36:40.28 --> 01:36:45.56
in New Zealand and the continues on and then finally we get to this I'm not going to say that

995
01:36:45.56 --> 01:36:50.36
we knew we were leaving for good but many sense this might be the case so did everyone in Wellington

996
01:36:50.36 --> 01:36:55.64
the girls especially just before our ships cast off again for Hawks Bay a number of girls some

997
01:36:55.64 --> 01:37:01.56
hugely pregnant came down to the docks to find out what was going on nobody could or would tell them anything

998
01:37:02.44 --> 01:37:07.48
but many had dire for it nobody knew you guys didn't even know we did had no no never clue

999
01:37:07.48 --> 01:37:13.000
without we're going another another another land here exercise our ship steam north past Hawks Bay

1000
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.80
continued on a northern league yet after a few days it's he was announced that we were going to

1001
01:37:17.80 --> 01:37:24.68
invade the Taroa toll in the Gilbert Islands maps and sand tables were brought it out one square mile

1002
01:37:24.68 --> 01:37:31.16
one square mile our sudden permanent disappearance from New Zealand was very hard on our Kiwi

1003
01:37:31.16 --> 01:37:37.24
girlfriends and wives one day they woke up to find us gone a new year head into battle

1004
01:37:37.24 --> 01:37:42.28
then towards the end of November they started hearing rumors that a lot of us had been killed

1005
01:37:43.24 --> 01:37:53.72
the rumors proved to be true yeah we lost over eleven hundred killed and twenty five hundred

1006
01:37:53.72 --> 01:38:03.24
wounded in three days most of them two days so you get to Taroa and here we are the navy promised

1007
01:38:03.24 --> 01:38:08.12
us a preliminary build bombardment that would blow the Japanese and their defenses to kingdom come

1008
01:38:08.12 --> 01:38:12.36
leaving the Marines to carry out what would amount to little more than a mopping up operation

1009
01:38:13.08 --> 01:38:19.000
during a pre invasion staff briefing an admiral announced that it was not the navy's intention

1010
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:25.24
merely to neutralize ratio island gentlemen he told me assemblage we will obliterate it

1011
01:38:26.12 --> 01:38:31.48
this statement was passed on to rank and file and we believed it at the same briefing a battle ship

1012
01:38:31.48 --> 01:38:36.52
captain declared we are going to bombard at six thousand yards we've got so much armor

1013
01:38:36.52 --> 01:38:41.08
we're not afraid of anything the japs control back at us the commander of the second marine

1014
01:38:41.08 --> 01:38:46.44
division major general julian c-smith was in sense to buy the captains brave words gentlemen

1015
01:38:46.44 --> 01:38:51.72
he retorted remember one thing when the Marines land and meet the enemy at bay net point

1016
01:38:51.72 --> 01:38:58.60
the only armor a marine will have is his khaki shirt it is unbelievable though when you see

1017
01:38:58.60 --> 01:39:02.84
the bombardment you can see film of the bombardment at Taroa i mean they just look like it was just

1018
01:39:02.84 --> 01:39:11.08
obliterators right and i had i had a situation where my guys in the battle of ramaati

1019
01:39:12.04 --> 01:39:20.68
got caught in a friendly fire situation and you were there ramaati yep and uh an army unit that

1020
01:39:20.68 --> 01:39:28.04
we had called for qrf came in and put about 150 rounds of 50 caliber machine gun fire into the building

1021
01:39:28.04 --> 01:39:36.04
that my guys were in at a range of about 25 meters 150 rounds and you you would think anybody

1022
01:39:36.04 --> 01:39:41.64
that's seen a 50 caliber machine gun you'd think everyone in that building would be dead but

1023
01:39:41.64 --> 01:39:48.12
what i'd one guy get wounded it wasn't actually all that bad and so when you see the the that's

1024
01:39:48.12 --> 01:39:54.84
why you can never trust that you know big bombs are going to actually solve the problem it doesn't

1025
01:39:54.84 --> 01:39:59.72
always happen and this is a classic example of that and the main reason that naval gun fire

1026
01:39:59.72 --> 01:40:04.92
wasn't wasn't all that effective is that we're just only you know the land was only about six

1027
01:40:04.92 --> 01:40:11.80
foot above sea level so things you must have just gone over if you hit there it's just such a narrow

1028
01:40:11.80 --> 01:40:19.16
target and they what you should have done is landed on a adjacent island and pounded it with

1029
01:40:19.16 --> 01:40:24.68
what the way mortars are you know a sharp rain artillery safe fire and that's what they did and that's

1030
01:40:24.68 --> 01:40:28.68
what they did in the marshals they made all difference their world less and learn to no much later

1031
01:40:29.32 --> 01:40:33.32
so you say this it's tough going right from the start the Japanese are heavily armed firmly and deeply

1032
01:40:33.32 --> 01:40:38.84
entrenched and as always they've resist fiercely infecting heavy uh inflicting heavy casualties

1033
01:40:38.84 --> 01:40:43.08
on our assault teams the radio reports start coming in their spotty and intermittent but we get the

1034
01:40:43.08 --> 01:40:48.52
picture encountering heavy resistance heavy machine gun fire boats destroyed units scattered

1035
01:40:48.52 --> 01:40:53.24
many casualties the voices on the loudspeakers are numerate these calamities and measured tones

1036
01:40:53.24 --> 01:40:59.08
they sound calm almost attached if you if you didn't know better you'd think the situation wasn't too

1037
01:40:59.08 --> 01:41:05.88
terrible but we knew better we were all looking at each other thinking some version of oh boy this is bad

1038
01:41:05.88 --> 01:41:13.08
this is really bad the tides the tides which were supposed to cover the reef to an adequate depth

1039
01:41:13.08 --> 01:41:18.84
proved uncooperative the waters too shallow just inches and just inches deep in some spots

1040
01:41:18.84 --> 01:41:23.24
and always less than needed for the three foot draft of the landing craft see the problem

1041
01:41:23.24 --> 01:41:29.48
was that there was just barely three feet what we require for now CBP to clear the reef

1042
01:41:30.12 --> 01:41:35.24
but we got hung up with their big guns their their big naval guns shooting under

1043
01:41:35.24 --> 01:41:40.52
transports so our transports had to move further out that means the all landing craft took a

1044
01:41:40.52 --> 01:41:45.64
lot longer to get in and the meantime the tide was going out now we didn't have three feet

1045
01:41:47.88 --> 01:41:53.88
not only that it was the kind of a tide that was extra low so you you were actually

1046
01:41:54.60 --> 01:41:59.000
part of the reserve element is that is that the right we were going what you were doing the one

1047
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.72
out the the battalion on him was going to was supposed to land on the next island up

1048
01:42:03.72 --> 01:42:10.76
instead hey oh we need to write down here in real and unright the middle where the worst of

1049
01:42:10.76 --> 01:42:16.52
it was so here here we had our guys on the beach and here here the enemy should know where

1050
01:42:16.52 --> 01:42:25.16
they're head right at us out there we could do anything but yeah terrible so just for folks

1051
01:42:25.16 --> 01:42:31.08
they don't understand what you just said you've got marines on the beach on the beach looking at us

1052
01:42:31.08 --> 01:42:35.80
Washington's being mowed down and you're at sea and we can't shoot back you can't shoot because

1053
01:42:35.80 --> 01:42:40.52
now there's friendly forces in between you two just and like you said the sea level is only

1054
01:42:40.52 --> 01:42:48.28
are the altitude only six feet and not only that there was one beach to have a British transport

1055
01:42:48.84 --> 01:42:53.48
and it was beach it it had been run before we landed there sometime before about time before

1056
01:42:53.48 --> 01:43:00.52
our work and run up like on on the reef and just was still there while the Japanese swam up to it

1057
01:43:00.52 --> 01:43:08.84
with the machine guns they fired flying in fire right on us so all this is happening and you

1058
01:43:08.84 --> 01:43:13.80
run the reserves and finally you guys are told all right load your boats which means you guys

1059
01:43:13.80 --> 01:43:17.88
now know you're going in and you say here we don't know whether the brass is setting us yet but we

1060
01:43:17.88 --> 01:43:23.24
don't expect to go where the fighting is hottest and we expect to go soon we circle and circle

1061
01:43:23.24 --> 01:43:27.16
in the lagoon we're standing in the boat either leaning against the sides or holding on them

1062
01:43:27.16 --> 01:43:31.24
for balance in general we have a soft ride because the water is mostly still except for the

1063
01:43:31.24 --> 01:43:37.64
turbulence caused by all the boats the turbulence buffets the LCVPs and this movement combined

1064
01:43:37.64 --> 01:43:43.80
with the stench of the engine and the nervous tension we all feel makes many of a sick some of the sick

1065
01:43:43.80 --> 01:43:48.20
men some of the sick men stick their heads over the sides to stretch while there's puke into the

1066
01:43:48.20 --> 01:43:53.000
wooden deck the men standing next to them just step aside like it's no big deal to get sick

1067
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.48
because it really isn't a big deal when the men when the sick men finish wretched they straighten

1068
01:43:57.48 --> 01:44:03.08
up as if nothing had happened no one thinks the worst of them for it after a while depending on how

1069
01:44:03.08 --> 01:44:07.88
long we're out there in the boat the deck might be slippery with puke but that's no big deal either

1070
01:44:07.88 --> 01:44:12.36
you can't smell the vomit or anything else for that matter because the exhaust fumes overpower

1071
01:44:12.36 --> 01:44:19.48
every other smell diesel engine help the minutes go by lengthening into hours the hours go by

1072
01:44:19.48 --> 01:44:25.64
but we're going nowhere we're just going around and around the sounds of battle are muted this far out

1073
01:44:25.64 --> 01:44:30.60
we can hear artillery explosions but not small arms fire we're all peering over the sides looking

1074
01:44:30.60 --> 01:44:35.96
abysio looking at the fires and the smoke and the explosions it's an awesome sight a massive smoke and

1075
01:44:35.96 --> 01:44:41.24
flames holy Moses look at that we say not for the last time we ask ourselves how many of the

1076
01:44:41.24 --> 01:44:46.52
defenders how the defenders could survive in a place so torn up it's an irrelevant question really

1077
01:44:46.52 --> 01:44:54.28
many Japanese have survived and they're killing them but have them survived we know that a lot of

1078
01:44:54.28 --> 01:45:00.20
our men were killed going in and we know that the men who did make it a sure are fighting for their

1079
01:45:00.20 --> 01:45:05.48
lives we expect we'll have a tough go of it to wear apprehensive who wouldn't be and we're wondering

1080
01:45:05.48 --> 01:45:10.36
how we'll behave in combat I know the new guys are especially concerned with how they'll behave

1081
01:45:10.36 --> 01:45:16.12
the great fear the greatest of fear is you won't be able to handle it that you'll turn yellow

1082
01:45:16.12 --> 01:45:21.96
that you'll let your buddies down we fear this much more than we fear getting killed or wounded

1083
01:45:21.96 --> 01:45:25.96
one reason for that is no one really thinks he'll be killed or wounded you never think it's going

1084
01:45:25.96 --> 01:45:31.24
to happen to you never you acknowledge that it could happen to you that it might happen to you

1085
01:45:31.24 --> 01:45:36.60
but the rational part of your brain makes you understand this but in the such circumstances we now

1086
01:45:36.60 --> 01:45:42.68
find ourselves emotion trumps rationality every time we know we're too young to die and somehow

1087
01:45:42.68 --> 01:45:47.56
in a kind of strange and protective twist of logic and feeling we figure that because we're too

1088
01:45:47.56 --> 01:45:53.56
young to die we certainly won't die you've got to do a lot of hard thinking to reach this conclusion

1089
01:45:53.56 --> 01:45:58.60
however and because we're all thinking so hard we're not talking that much just as well

1090
01:45:58.60 --> 01:46:02.36
the engine is so loud you can't talk or hear anyone except the guy standing next to you

1091
01:46:03.24 --> 01:46:07.72
we wait for the word to begin the assault but it doesn't come we continue circling beneath the

1092
01:46:07.72 --> 01:46:14.68
hot sun beneath breathing exhaust fumes staring at the island we want we want to know what for

1093
01:46:14.68 --> 01:46:19.08
Pete's sake is happening we wonder what they're when they're going to send us in and where

1094
01:46:19.08 --> 01:46:24.52
they're going to send us we wonder gosh how much longer can it go all like this a lot longer it

1095
01:46:24.52 --> 01:46:31.64
turns out nightfall one moment in the sun one moment the sun is above the horizon and their sky is

1096
01:46:31.64 --> 01:46:35.40
bright then the sun drops below the horizon in the dark that's how night comes in the

1097
01:46:35.40 --> 01:46:41.32
tropics no twilight this is on the on-hequator you see yeah boom it's gone yeah it's bright one moment

1098
01:46:41.32 --> 01:46:48.20
dark the next beijo isn't dark however beijo is on fire and the sky above it glowing red suddenly

1099
01:46:48.20 --> 01:46:55.16
it's morning see the problem is that the top command thought we'd already landed and really there was

1100
01:46:55.16 --> 01:47:01.80
just a lack there was all communications were disrupted so you guys are out there for so they didn't

1101
01:47:01.80 --> 01:47:06.28
know we're out there still circling didn't know it how much fuel does things have because you're

1102
01:47:06.28 --> 01:47:15.32
out there for twenty hours oh twenty hours yeah amazing not horrible yeah that's usually

1103
01:47:15.32 --> 01:47:18.68
Sunday it's morning the sun pops over the horizon and then there was light we're still

1104
01:47:18.68 --> 01:47:22.84
circling waiting for orders base you always still burning I was wondering how our boat can carry

1105
01:47:22.84 --> 01:47:29.32
enough fuel to circle how long is it 12 14 16 hours answer we float we were float for about 20 hours

1106
01:47:29.32 --> 01:47:34.76
our mouths dry our muscle stiff we feel haggard and cruddy some guys are sipping from their

1107
01:47:34.76 --> 01:47:39.000
cantines or nibbling on the rations although there's not much eating because we just aren't hungry

1108
01:47:40.44 --> 01:47:46.76
about five zero five thirty the LCVBA LCVP carrying our batai commander major major

1109
01:47:46.76 --> 01:47:51.000
warranties chugs along up next to our boat cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting to

1110
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:57.000
make himself heard above the noise of the boat engines he says we're going in at red beach too oh no

1111
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.96
and what what why was that why was that a bad thing we knew that that probably

1112
01:48:01.96 --> 01:48:05.64
some way we knew that that was where they haven't heard this time was on that beach

1113
01:48:07.72 --> 01:48:13.80
still shouting major haze assures us that red too won't be a problem the Japanese positions

1114
01:48:13.80 --> 01:48:18.52
on the beach have been eliminated he tells us and our landing will be unopposed you'll probably

1115
01:48:18.52 --> 01:48:23.72
go in standing up he actually said that so you said in the book he actually said I guess we were

1116
01:48:23.72 --> 01:48:30.44
completely surprised thinking back we were none of us really believed we'd go in standing up now

1117
01:48:30.44 --> 01:48:35.56
not that we think meet major haze is feeding us a line he's a good man he wouldn't do that

1118
01:48:35.80 --> 01:48:41.96
but it could be that he has been misinformed uninformed is more likely more like it totally

1119
01:48:41.96 --> 01:48:47.08
uninformed communications with the units ashore or deseray and several instances functionally

1120
01:48:47.08 --> 01:48:51.72
not existed the same goes for communications with general smith and his staff on the battle

1121
01:48:51.72 --> 01:48:57.80
ship Maryland the invasions fleet flagship this is doing large but charged measure to failure

1122
01:48:57.80 --> 01:49:01.96
of our radios which are too fragile to withstand the rigors of amphibious assault

1123
01:49:02.76 --> 01:49:07.08
I've got a walking talking strapped over my shoulder and it's a hunk of joke hunk of junk

1124
01:49:07.08 --> 01:49:12.44
I can't even communicate with the other boats which is why major haze had to come by in

1125
01:49:12.44 --> 01:49:17.56
but that's true what was that what was the fucking dog is what we're doing any good now the

1126
01:49:17.56 --> 01:49:24.04
officer in charge a red two at that time was Colonel Schupe the 10 of Colonel Schupe he became the

1127
01:49:24.04 --> 01:49:31.64
combatant later on years later in any event we're relieved the waiting is almost over the business

1128
01:49:31.64 --> 01:49:36.12
of riding around in boats is for the birds we want to get ashore and throw some punches I'm

1129
01:49:36.12 --> 01:49:41.88
standing in the battle of our LCVP behind me are 32 marines of my pertune most of them teenagers

1130
01:49:41.88 --> 01:49:46.92
most of them new to combat I look at them and they look at me I see fresh boyace facias

1131
01:49:46.92 --> 01:49:54.52
and wide-wired eyes staring out from beneath their brain their helmet brims their helmets

1132
01:49:54.52 --> 01:50:00.84
all seem a size too big accentuating their boyish making them look young as well most of them

1133
01:50:00.84 --> 01:50:06.04
really are their helmets jammed down on their heads the straps pulled tight under their chin you

1134
01:50:06.04 --> 01:50:10.20
can wear helmets this way so they don't fall off while you're clamoring down the cargo nets of

1135
01:50:10.20 --> 01:50:14.44
the troop transport into your boat the helmet is nothing more than a steel pot heavy and getting

1136
01:50:14.44 --> 01:50:18.76
heavier the longer you wear it if it falls off all you're on that net it could hit somebody beneath

1137
01:50:18.76 --> 01:50:23.56
you somebody could get hurt and that's when and that's not when marines are supposed to get hurt

1138
01:50:23.56 --> 01:50:28.12
not during the boating phase as it's called the phase of the operation when the emphasis is on

1139
01:50:28.12 --> 01:50:34.28
safety the getting hurt part the part where safety is one might say beside the point comes later

1140
01:50:34.84 --> 01:50:38.84
for us for me in the men in my boat that part comes now

1141
01:50:38.84 --> 01:50:46.60
did I say men well I suppose they are we call them men we treat them as men we expect them to act

1142
01:50:46.60 --> 01:50:53.000
like men they are after all united states marines but really their kids just out of high school

1143
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.92
or not even that kids with rifles true kids trained to kill also true but kids never the last

1144
01:50:58.92 --> 01:51:07.000
just turn 17 many of them to use a term like that as long since fallen into general disuse their

1145
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:14.44
youths a state of being between childhood and adulthood today's american mail at exercising

1146
01:51:14.44 --> 01:51:19.72
a lifestyle choice can often can and often does loiter for many years in that state but in the

1147
01:51:19.72 --> 01:51:27.48
mid-1940s in a world at war the state of youth tends to pass swiftly and do any disayet violently

1148
01:51:28.12 --> 01:51:33.64
the youth the kids on my boat have got a lot of growing up to do unfortunately they'll be

1149
01:51:33.64 --> 01:51:39.32
doing a hefty portion of that growing up in the coming minutes and hours in that period

1150
01:51:40.36 --> 01:51:45.48
far too many will undergrow all the growing up they will ever experience

1151
01:51:47.32 --> 01:51:56.52
these are the men that went in and I have a WRK written on all the casualties in this picture

1152
01:51:56.52 --> 01:52:04.68
and roughly half half her casualties going in

1153
01:52:08.92 --> 01:52:11.16
in that period

1154
01:52:12.44 --> 01:52:17.08
the youths the kids on my boat have got a lot of growing up to do unfortunately they'll be

1155
01:52:17.08 --> 01:52:22.04
doing a hefty portion of that growing up in the coming minutes and hours in that period many

1156
01:52:22.04 --> 01:52:27.48
far too many will undergrow all the growing up they will ever experience they will transition

1157
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:32.92
with almost obscene dispatch from youth to adulthood to the grave

1158
01:52:34.52 --> 01:52:41.96
a beggio youth won't be served it will be served up and consumed literally in fire these youths will be

1159
01:52:41.96 --> 01:52:50.84
men only briefly and then they will be just a memory forever all of this sounds as if i'm a

1160
01:52:50.84 --> 01:52:56.68
grizzled veteran i am a combat veteran i fought in Guadalcanal earlier this year but the fact is i'm

1161
01:52:56.68 --> 01:53:01.80
just 23 years old still young and not all that grizzled in appearance or temperament practically

1162
01:53:01.80 --> 01:53:08.36
speaking though i'm the graveyard of this bunch same goes for the platoon sergeant who's about my age

1163
01:53:08.36 --> 01:53:13.80
where the tribal elders the warrior chiefs i'll lead my boys off the boat and the platoon sergeant

1164
01:53:13.80 --> 01:53:19.08
standing in the back will make sure they follow urging them and conjolling them yelling at them

1165
01:53:19.08 --> 01:53:24.60
maybe throwing a few choice cuss words whatever it takes to get them moving i'm watching my

1166
01:53:24.60 --> 01:53:31.08
boys as they watch me things begin to happen fast with the majors lzvp leading the way our boats

1167
01:53:31.08 --> 01:53:39.48
break formation one after the other and file off to our departure line this is an invisible line

1168
01:53:39.48 --> 01:53:44.92
about 6,000 yards offshore that runs parallel to the landing beaches when we get there our boats are

1169
01:53:44.92 --> 01:53:50.36
form up all the inline abreast arrayed like a cavalry squadron waiting for the bugle to sound

1170
01:53:50.36 --> 01:53:54.76
charge the coxons rev and gun the engines in neutral gear and the boats are rearing and

1171
01:53:54.76 --> 01:54:00.12
lurching trump charting at the bit it's as if the coxons are struggling to rain in war horses

1172
01:54:00.12 --> 01:54:05.24
that can't contain their eagerness for battle our boats engine is blasting the noise almost painful

1173
01:54:05.24 --> 01:54:11.64
to the years we're pumped up my men i and i i we're really pumped up the adrenaline is flowing

1174
01:54:11.64 --> 01:54:15.88
surging through us clutching our weapons looking over the side of the boat at the island breathing

1175
01:54:15.88 --> 01:54:22.68
hard thinking fast focused on the tastered hand stealing ourselves getting ready ready ready

1176
01:54:22.68 --> 01:54:28.52
here we go the signal is given our coxons shifts out of neutral pushes us all over the light brigade

1177
01:54:28.52 --> 01:54:37.88
but thinking right there yes yes and repeating repeating verbs as well you see

1178
01:54:37.88 --> 01:54:42.04
oh i'm ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready yeah ready yeah

1179
01:54:43.40 --> 01:54:48.92
little literary yeah little little literary so that's that's that's that's the thank you behind

1180
01:54:48.92 --> 01:54:55.72
tip of the hat yeah here we go the signal is given our coxons shifts out of neutral pushes the throttle

1181
01:54:55.72 --> 01:55:00.76
wide open the engine bellows betch's belch's smoke the stern dips the men in the boat rock

1182
01:55:00.76 --> 01:55:05.88
back slightly as the boat leaps forward now we're barreling toward the island our boat all the

1183
01:55:05.88 --> 01:55:13.16
boat 600 men more less of the first battalion eight marines water churning boiling behind the boat

1184
01:55:13.16 --> 01:55:18.28
we're bucketing and bouncing bullying ahead with our squared off bow musseling the water aside

1185
01:55:18.28 --> 01:55:23.08
the boat is throwing spray soaking us and we're getting closer closer to the island

1186
01:55:24.04 --> 01:55:29.56
we're about 800 yards from the shore when zip zip zip we hear tiny objects flying past

1187
01:55:29.56 --> 01:55:34.44
and those aren't hornets boys their bullets we're in the range of the Japanese machine guns

1188
01:55:34.44 --> 01:55:40.76
and good gosh they're shooting at us we find this interesting bullets zipping by

1189
01:55:40.76 --> 01:55:45.96
splatting on the water surface splash splat here splat there splats to the left and right

1190
01:55:45.96 --> 01:55:51.48
splats in front of us look by golly there's some enemy fire hitting right over there look over there

1191
01:55:51.48 --> 01:55:56.44
that's me talking that's all of us talking talking and pointing at the impact circles in the water

1192
01:55:56.44 --> 01:56:01.16
little splats little dots where bullets hit people shooting at us fascinating

1193
01:56:01.16 --> 01:56:06.04
realizing that we could get our head shot off we ducked down and ducked down into the boat

1194
01:56:06.04 --> 01:56:12.04
the more bullets splatting into the water but none hit our LCVP we tell ourselves that those are

1195
01:56:12.04 --> 01:56:18.04
that most are 7.7 millimeter slugs which is what your basic light Japanese machine gun fires

1196
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:22.44
and are nothing really much to worry about because they're too small to pierce even the thin

1197
01:56:22.44 --> 01:56:28.12
skined higgins boat that's what we tell ourselves all right but we really don't believe it

1198
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:33.88
we know good and well that the Japanese are also shooting at at us with heavier automatic weapon weapons

1199
01:56:33.88 --> 01:56:39.80
big 13 millimeter machine guns and the even bigger dual purpose anti boat anti aircraft guns

1200
01:56:39.80 --> 01:56:45.48
which range in size from 37 millimeter to 77 millimeter and they're lobbying shells from 70

1201
01:56:45.48 --> 01:56:52.28
millimeter mountain howwitsers these weapons can and do inflict considerable damage on our

1202
01:56:52.28 --> 01:56:58.20
salt teams killing and wounded hunting hundreds of them disabling or destroying many amtrax and

1203
01:56:58.20 --> 01:57:04.92
LCVPs they're not my conceife concern however and never mind that they might at any second

1204
01:57:04.92 --> 01:57:09.88
blow us to eternity what really bugs me is being hunkered down in this boat where I can't see anything

1205
01:57:09.88 --> 01:57:14.52
I can't see where we are where we're going where we should be I can't observe the enemy fire

1206
01:57:14.52 --> 01:57:19.16
engage resistance we're likely to encounter I feel as if I'm going into battle blindfolded

1207
01:57:19.16 --> 01:57:23.56
this really stinks how can I do my job if I can't see anything how can I be sure the

1208
01:57:23.56 --> 01:57:29.72
coxin is taking us to the right place my men what are they thinking they're watching me

1209
01:57:29.72 --> 01:57:35.72
watching to see how I'm bearing up well I'm watching them too and for the same reason they look

1210
01:57:35.72 --> 01:57:43.000
okay check that they look grim and resigned but that's good grim and resigned look means they've

1211
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.88
more or less accepted this situation which is also good because the situation isn't going to change

1212
01:57:47.88 --> 01:57:54.36
unless it changes for the worse this whole thing is on the rails it's a runaway train and there's

1213
01:57:54.36 --> 01:57:59.000
nothing going to stop it now if you know this if you accept it you can keep your fear under control

1214
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.88
and if you can keep your fear under control you'll do your job you won't let your buddies down

1215
01:58:05.32 --> 01:58:10.52
so we're doing fine relatively speaking the boat is racing toward the shore when

1216
01:58:10.52 --> 01:58:17.72
crying scraping bottom metal grinding on coral it abruptly stops we're thrown forward cursing

1217
01:58:17.72 --> 01:58:22.60
we've run a ground all along the reef it's the same boat grinding to a halt on base

1218
01:58:22.60 --> 01:58:28.36
yours fringing reef I think what the heck the tide is supposed to be up the water deep enough to

1219
01:58:28.36 --> 01:58:35.88
allow the LCVPs to clear the reef we're 600 yards from the shore 600 long yards this just cannot be

1220
01:58:35.88 --> 01:58:45.08
wrong it can be it is though we're not aware of it where victims of the same disagreeable

1221
01:58:45.08 --> 01:58:50.20
title conditions that fouled up yesterday's landings this is as far as we go our cox and yells

1222
01:58:50.76 --> 01:58:57.16
we're going on mode his passengers are not happy there are exclamations of astonishment and protest

1223
01:58:57.16 --> 01:59:02.60
oh shit you gotta be kidding but he's not kidding yeah this is far as we go here repeats we're hung up

1224
01:59:02.60 --> 01:59:07.80
we've hit the reef you gotta get out here then he works the controls that release the cables that

1225
01:59:07.80 --> 01:59:13.88
hold the ramp up the cables which are still strong along the sides of the whole unwind with a

1226
01:59:13.88 --> 01:59:20.84
macaalic metallic rasp the ramp screeches as it opens drops splashes into the water and there

1227
01:59:20.84 --> 01:59:29.32
before us is basio in all its hideous glory not to exaggerate or overdramatize but it is a scene

1228
01:59:29.32 --> 01:59:34.76
from hell i mean one second we're looking at this slab of a metal ramp then the ramp drops and

1229
01:59:34.76 --> 01:59:40.92
we're looking at it in furno fire and smoke fill our bit frame of vision frame by the sides of the

1230
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:46.92
bottom and the bottom of the boat orange fire red fire and black black smoke the fire is shooting

1231
01:59:46.92 --> 01:59:54.04
up the smoke is rolling curling climbing is fast and high the sky isn't high enough to contain it

1232
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:59.000
you think we were looking at a volcano being born you wonder what could produce so much smoke

1233
02:00:00.04 --> 02:00:06.92
surely by now everything on basio that can burn has burned so where's all that smoke coming from

1234
02:00:06.92 --> 02:00:11.16
from the bowels of the earth it would seem from somewhere deep underground under the ocean

1235
02:00:11.16 --> 02:00:17.32
from the ever ever blazing furnaces of the world unless not forget the explosions there are a lot of

1236
02:00:17.32 --> 02:00:23.000
them explosions here they're everywhere fire and fire balls tongues of flame crimson and yellow flashes in

1237
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:29.64
the smoke the time is 0-615 and some 600 marines are about to be launched or rather launch

1238
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:37.40
themselves at basio codenamed Helen i'm at the front of the boat the lieutenant the platoon leader

1239
02:00:37.96 --> 02:00:45.000
time for me to lead a few seconds go by i was a few seconds ago i was deploying the limited

1240
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.60
protection offered by the thin metal ramp now i'm deploying the lack of that limited protection

1241
02:00:50.60 --> 02:00:58.12
it was after all better than nothing which is what i've got now i kind of feel sick and i'm thinking

1242
02:00:58.12 --> 02:01:03.24
god why am i in this mess what am i doing here but i'm resigned to the situation i've got to

1243
02:01:03.24 --> 02:01:12.12
write it out no matter what happens no turning back now so the ramp hits the water and i run down

1244
02:01:12.12 --> 02:01:17.40
the ramp clutching my m1 carbine waving my guys forward shouting let's go i sense that my

1245
02:01:17.40 --> 02:01:21.72
manner hesitating by the pain no attention to them i jump into the water not knowing how deep it'll

1246
02:01:21.72 --> 02:01:27.24
be thinking that i might jump into a shell hole and go all the way under but i land on coral and sand

1247
02:01:27.24 --> 02:01:32.68
solid footing that's only five deep water relief and the water feels good that incredibly is my

1248
02:01:32.68 --> 02:01:38.28
first thought the water feels good it's calm and warm like bath water almost soothing a pleasant

1249
02:01:38.28 --> 02:01:44.12
contrast to the still cool morning air it's murky though sand and coral all stirred up beneath the

1250
02:01:44.12 --> 02:01:50.12
surface none of that crystalline purity that comes to mind when you picture a tropical lagoon

1251
02:01:50.12 --> 02:01:59.64
war comes to paradise and literally fouls it up i look sure word only 600 yards to go

1252
02:01:59.64 --> 02:02:13.56
now the fellow that reached down and pulled me up over the ramp here a few months ago

1253
02:02:15.56 --> 02:02:23.96
we ran across a photograph of him and what did it look like and a little bit of reference to

1254
02:02:23.96 --> 02:02:31.80
his family but never never made a contact now this is as of within six months or so ago

1255
02:02:33.64 --> 02:02:40.76
so this is and nobody and nobody else i talked to really knew who this guy was he was new to the

1256
02:02:40.76 --> 02:02:46.92
outfit he was the sergeant he was new so but nobody knew him at reunions didn't know him

1257
02:02:46.92 --> 02:02:55.96
so you look out there's six hundred and he and he and I were being lifted up by the

1258
02:02:55.96 --> 02:03:03.96
by the transport and a bat sabisid and a basket and remote and says it just as we were okay

1259
02:03:03.96 --> 02:03:12.60
just about up from the landing boat and in this basket taken a reason up to the transport itself

1260
02:03:12.60 --> 02:03:21.08
and i made a comment says looks like looks like we made it his comment was you made it you made it

1261
02:03:22.68 --> 02:03:30.44
and he died so you look down going back to this point when the ramp actually opens and you see you've

1262
02:03:30.44 --> 02:03:37.72
got 600 yards to go and just nothing but machine gun fire and as you said earlier the Japanese

1263
02:03:37.72 --> 02:03:43.96
you'd watch them storm forward without any ability to maneuver just only thing to do with the salt

1264
02:03:43.96 --> 02:03:49.96
and now here you are we are no maneuver in the exact same situation yeah we're in there saving

1265
02:03:49.96 --> 02:03:57.64
in completely at their mercy you say here 600 yards six football fields just under a third of a

1266
02:03:57.64 --> 02:04:03.64
mile if you run that distance on dry land unencumbered and unimposed you'll be gasping at the

1267
02:04:03.64 --> 02:04:07.64
finish line i don't care what kind of shape you're in we're in water and we're wearing and

1268
02:04:07.64 --> 02:04:13.16
carrying 60 pounds or more of gear and the Japanese are ripping us apart they've got an absolutely

1269
02:04:13.16 --> 02:04:19.88
clear field of fire and we have to walk straight into it when i returned and i looked i went

1270
02:04:19.88 --> 02:04:25.56
clear out there where i was hit and walked in and i saw remains of old carbines and so on down in

1271
02:04:25.56 --> 02:04:36.12
the sand we've got a walk not run because we're in the water remember walk slowly because we

1272
02:04:36.12 --> 02:04:42.36
can't run we can't even walk fast the marines are the world's experts in amphibious warfare the

1273
02:04:42.36 --> 02:04:47.32
core has been training for the past two decades to assault an established beach head on a hostile

1274
02:04:47.32 --> 02:04:53.08
shore it has developed complex doctrines to guide us in such endeavors at bayjio on 21 November

1275
02:04:53.08 --> 02:04:59.16
1943 all that training in doctrine doctrine has come to this we step out of our LCVPs into shallow

1276
02:04:59.16 --> 02:05:06.44
water and walk slowly across 600 yards with absolutely no cover whatsoever to make a frontal assault

1277
02:05:06.44 --> 02:05:16.04
on heavily fortified and defended enemy positions on my website just go to it by my name just

1278
02:05:16.04 --> 02:05:23.80
Dean Lad there is a poem in here called curtains of fire and it goes in a great detail similar

1279
02:05:23.80 --> 02:05:31.96
kind of words but done done a little differently and it's so that's where that's where it's all spilled out

1280
02:05:34.60 --> 02:05:38.68
you you say some training in some doctrine that they've been working on that's your quote

1281
02:05:38.68 --> 02:05:44.12
we cannot believe the volume of fire that's coming from the island the air is just filled with bullets

1282
02:05:44.12 --> 02:05:50.28
we can't see them but we can see where they hit splat splat splat like raime drops dotting the

1283
02:05:50.28 --> 02:05:56.04
water dot pattern sweeping back and forth across our line curtains a curtain of fire it's called

1284
02:05:56.04 --> 02:06:02.60
curtain of fire passing over us through us yeah I realize oh my god the Japanese have got this

1285
02:06:02.60 --> 02:06:07.72
reef zeroed in which means they don't even have to aim their machine guns they just lock the guns

1286
02:06:07.72 --> 02:06:12.36
to a predetermined setting and traverse the barrel left and right left and right just a lot

1287
02:06:12.36 --> 02:06:19.000
along the reef like shooting a fish in a barrel yeah yeah major haze was right he said we'd be going

1288
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.76
in standing up and that's what we're doing not that we want to there's no other way no place to run

1289
02:06:24.76 --> 02:06:29.16
no place to hide some men crowds in the water they watch the bullet patterns the curtains trying

1290
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:33.48
to figure out when the curtain will sweep over them it's all a matter of timing they'll duck

1291
02:06:33.48 --> 02:06:38.44
under water at the right moment to avoid getting shot it would be a good plan if only there were

1292
02:06:38.44 --> 02:06:42.68
two if only there were one or two machine guns firing at them but there are many many machine

1293
02:06:42.68 --> 02:06:47.64
guns firing creating multiple curtains that meet and intermingle an overlap and crisscross

1294
02:06:47.64 --> 02:06:53.08
yeah bullets are flying every which way worse the guns are aimed to fire just inches above the

1295
02:06:53.08 --> 02:06:58.12
surface so if you crouch with your head just above the water you're likely to get your head drilled

1296
02:06:59.24 --> 02:07:04.28
might as well stand up that way you'll get shot the chest or stomach which is usually fatal

1297
02:07:04.28 --> 02:07:10.76
instead of to the head which is almost always fatal also if you're crouching in the water you're

1298
02:07:10.76 --> 02:07:15.32
not moving and if you're not moving your stationary target and your easier to shoot you have to

1299
02:07:15.32 --> 02:07:21.72
keep moving you have to get to shore get a shore or die and the whole thing orders were don't

1300
02:07:21.72 --> 02:07:29.000
stop to help anybody everybody's going to get killed just you get sure stuff in my man that's

1301
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:36.36
stop to help me violate those orders that told him don't wait for me go on no they they just took

1302
02:07:36.36 --> 02:07:44.04
a stick around walking straight into curtains of machine gun fires not something that comes naturally

1303
02:07:44.84 --> 02:07:51.48
your instinct's oppose it every fiber of your beam being seems screams in protest resisting

1304
02:07:51.48 --> 02:07:57.32
telling you no way it hell am I going to do that that's why when I glance over my shoulder to see

1305
02:07:57.32 --> 02:08:03.000
how my man are doing I see that I haven't that many haven't left the boat a few most likely those

1306
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.60
that are just next to me in the boat are in the water but the others are bunched up at the top of

1307
02:08:06.60 --> 02:08:13.40
the ramp all tensed up to take the plunge but hesitating unable to make themselves move I can't

1308
02:08:13.40 --> 02:08:19.48
blame themselves for hanging back but I can't allow it for one thing they make a big fat target

1309
02:08:19.48 --> 02:08:23.000
standing they're crowded together at the front of the boat they've got to get into the water

1310
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.72
and disperse before the Japanese machine guns find them and wipe them out with a couple well place

1311
02:08:27.72 --> 02:08:32.52
purse but more important they've got a job to do they've got to get off the boat get a sure

1312
02:08:32.52 --> 02:08:37.72
and fight and kill Japanese I gesture them and shout come on guys let's go get moving move out

1313
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:46.36
they obey me they get moving they're good men the best they charge down the ramp jump

1314
02:08:46.36 --> 02:08:51.56
feet first in the water start waiting toward the shore and that's when the slaughter really begins

1315
02:08:51.56 --> 02:08:57.24
right away the men around me my men are taking hits and falling I'm very aware of this

1316
02:08:57.24 --> 02:09:01.72
I'm hearing cries for help cries for corpsmen the wounded are calling out corpsmen corpsmen I'm

1317
02:09:01.72 --> 02:09:06.60
hit I'm hit over here they're calling out as loud as they can I see men going under

1318
02:09:06.60 --> 02:09:13.000
often for the last time what do I do I keep moving forward that's what cries for help everywhere

1319
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:18.20
and I ignore them I have to you get hot you get hit you just have to keep going you have to

1320
02:09:18.20 --> 02:09:23.40
cope with it yourself do the best you can hope for the best the sounds of battle are everywhere

1321
02:09:24.52 --> 02:09:29.24
there are those sweeping slashing curtains of fire dozens of machine guns rattling a

1322
02:09:29.24 --> 02:09:37.08
a cacophony of staccato hammering artillery shells exploding in the water splashing throwing up

1323
02:09:37.08 --> 02:09:43.72
washing gaizers of water and human body parts and most especially most memory the shouts and

1324
02:09:43.72 --> 02:09:50.28
screams of the wounded in the dying oh god I'm hit corpsmen over here corpsmen help me help me please

1325
02:09:52.20 --> 02:09:56.12
manner dropping everywhere to the left and right me falling and sinking into the water going

1326
02:09:56.12 --> 02:10:01.48
under some men don't cry out hardly make a sound when they're hit the bullet or bullets

1327
02:10:01.48 --> 02:10:06.36
thump into them they grunt and they're gone we're not permitted to help them the corpsmen can

1328
02:10:06.36 --> 02:10:12.68
come to the raid but but not the rest of us our orders are to move on to get to shore as fast as we can

1329
02:10:12.68 --> 02:10:17.56
if we stop the help the wounded will get shot too and we won't make it to the beach where we're

1330
02:10:17.56 --> 02:10:24.12
needed so we keep waiting forward my men my men from other boats the entire battalion what's

1331
02:10:24.12 --> 02:10:28.28
left of it struggling through the water holding the rifles over their heads pushing through

1332
02:10:28.28 --> 02:10:34.28
toward the beach and into the teeth of all that infillating gunfire they're courage is incredible

1333
02:10:34.28 --> 02:10:43.56
that world only begins to describe it insulating from that beach to British transport or ship

1334
02:10:44.52 --> 02:10:52.20
crossfire you guys are it yeah shells exploding washing gaizers machine guns rattling

1335
02:10:52.20 --> 02:10:56.84
splat splat splat those little dots in the water thousands of them moving this way and that

1336
02:10:56.84 --> 02:11:02.36
a bullet hits four feet to my right splat splat then bullets hit three feet two foot one foot to my

1337
02:11:02.36 --> 02:11:07.72
right sure do hope they skip over me and they do this time splat they begin hitting to my left one

1338
02:11:07.72 --> 02:11:13.000
foot two foot three foot and so on I got lucky I literally dodged the bullet several bullets how

1339
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:18.76
long will my luck hold I can't see any muzzle flashes from the enemy guns the Japanese are invisible

1340
02:11:18.76 --> 02:11:25.48
just like their bullets we're being slaughtered by an invisible force nothing to see nothing to shoot at

1341
02:11:25.48 --> 02:11:29.72
not that we would be shooting if we could see them you don't stand an open water shooting at the

1342
02:11:29.72 --> 02:11:34.44
enemy you get yourself to the beach you take cover and then you start shooting anyway my weapon

1343
02:11:34.44 --> 02:11:40.04
isn't good for shooting at long and medium ranges for that matter it's not much good at close range

1344
02:11:40.04 --> 02:11:45.16
either it's an m1 carbine a pathetic excuse for a fire arm a weakling with a weakling punch

1345
02:11:46.04 --> 02:11:50.28
I'm holding it at port arms across my chest as I weigh through the water maybe there'll be a stop

1346
02:11:50.28 --> 02:11:55.80
maybe there'll be a maybe it will stop a bullet that would otherwise kill me that's about all the

1347
02:11:55.80 --> 02:12:01.96
good it can do me I walk on pushing forward straining to move faster the water drag me at my thighs

1348
02:12:01.96 --> 02:12:09.000
no one ever said a speed rucker record running in five deep water I've gone about 100 yards only

1349
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:15.64
500 yards to go we're taking fire from the front from both flanks from the rear

1350
02:12:17.80 --> 02:12:21.88
the rear what the hell and that's what you talk about that's the that's the uh

1351
02:12:21.88 --> 02:12:27.72
uh sunken ship that's out there and there's well no no there are planes here now our planes

1352
02:12:27.72 --> 02:12:32.36
are coming in and strapping and we wonder what is going on of this when they were they were

1353
02:12:32.36 --> 02:12:41.08
strapping that ship I returned to the task at hand keep moving to the shore how long has

1354
02:12:41.08 --> 02:12:45.56
this been going on how long have been out here in the water I can't say I have no sense of time

1355
02:12:45.56 --> 02:12:50.60
everything is moving in slow motion second seems to last minutes minute seemed to last hours

1356
02:12:50.60 --> 02:12:56.04
it just keeps going on and on every moment is intense filled with intense thoughts emotions actions

1357
02:12:56.04 --> 02:13:01.000
I'm thinking how can I protect myself how can I protect my men someone screams another one of my

1358
02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.84
men is hit and another and another help corpsman some are killed outright some are wounded

1359
02:13:06.84 --> 02:13:12.20
some are well it's hard to say some go quietly some noisely they fall back in the water they

1360
02:13:12.20 --> 02:13:16.60
slip onto the water some flail in the water and they're paying in panic howling and shouting

1361
02:13:16.60 --> 02:13:22.12
I keep moving my adrenaline is flowing like an electric current through me allowing me to do things

1362
02:13:22.12 --> 02:13:27.08
I wouldn't normally and shouldn't normally do if I stop to think about what I'm doing I'd freeze up

1363
02:13:27.08 --> 02:13:32.44
I try to track the bullets the movement in patterns of the enemy's traversing fire the bullets

1364
02:13:32.44 --> 02:13:37.24
impact start to my left to my right the bullets sweeping back and forth I see no pattern

1365
02:13:37.24 --> 02:13:41.96
or rather I see too many patterns splat splat splat everywhere it's like the enemy throwing

1366
02:13:41.96 --> 02:13:47.24
thousands and thousands of stones at us a pattern of splats in the water comes towards me from the right

1367
02:13:47.24 --> 02:13:51.32
sweeps pass me continue to the left I don't hear the crack of the bullets as they zip by

1368
02:13:51.32 --> 02:13:56.04
its supersonic speed that's the problem they're not zipping past us they're hitting us they've got

1369
02:13:56.04 --> 02:14:00.84
our range I'm in the impact zone I have to get through it or die I turned to look back at my

1370
02:14:00.84 --> 02:14:07.16
men let's go I call out for the umpteenth time I turn facing this shore then finally it happens

1371
02:14:07.16 --> 02:14:14.44
a sickening splat like an inner tube being snapped across my abdomen slapping my bare stomach a sharp

1372
02:14:14.44 --> 02:14:20.92
staying sensation I'm hit I hear myself say a bullet is struck me nearly dead center below the

1373
02:14:20.92 --> 02:14:28.20
naval piercing me above the water line I'm gut shot one of the worst wounds of all oh god

1374
02:14:28.20 --> 02:14:37.24
I've probably been hit by small caliber machine gun bullet fired from straight ahead on the beach

1375
02:14:37.24 --> 02:14:41.40
it didn't make much of an impact not long enough to knock me off my feet or even stagger me

1376
02:14:41.40 --> 02:14:46.44
later I would learn to tour right through my body piercing my intestines later and goodness it didn't

1377
02:14:46.44 --> 02:14:55.48
hit a bone yeah so it pierced your intestines bladder and sacrum just before that

1378
02:14:55.48 --> 02:15:04.60
and an exited missing my spinal nerve by a quarter of an inch as it is I'll probably

1379
02:15:04.60 --> 02:15:11.24
die in a few minutes I'm scared I think my gosh this is it if it happens that you get shot

1380
02:15:11.24 --> 02:15:14.84
and you don't know how bad the wound it often happens that you get shot you don't know how bad

1381
02:15:14.84 --> 02:15:20.84
the wound is but when you're hit where I was hit you know it's bad it's a gut wound and you

1382
02:15:20.84 --> 02:15:26.12
know it's pretty sure thing you're not going to make it very few people survive gut wounds even in the

1383
02:15:26.12 --> 02:15:33.24
best of circumstances I'm in what are arguably the worst of circumstances if I had been shot on

1384
02:15:33.24 --> 02:15:38.28
try land I might be able to crawl to an aid station or my buddies might have passed me up but I'm

1385
02:15:38.28 --> 02:15:43.80
in a lagoon so there can be no crawling and my buddies are forbidden to help me it goes without saying

1386
02:15:43.80 --> 02:15:49.24
that there are no aid stations close by I can try to reach our LCVPs on the reef a hundred yards

1387
02:15:49.24 --> 02:15:57.000
behind me but I probably won't make it I'm dying is why I don't my gear into the water off goes my

1388
02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.04
pack my helmet my webbing the walkie talkie slung over my shoulder goodbye m1 carbine into the drink

1389
02:16:02.04 --> 02:16:07.96
you go never shot fired an anger it takes just seconds for me to shock my equipment in those seconds

1390
02:16:07.96 --> 02:16:13.24
I lose most of my strength after a few more seconds I'm almost too weak to stand it happens that

1391
02:16:13.24 --> 02:16:18.68
fast the energy is draining out of me I'm going into shock the weakness doesn't paralyze me and it

1392
02:16:18.68 --> 02:16:23.08
doesn't come from any place in particular it's an overall sort of feeling that makes me go heavy and

1393
02:16:23.08 --> 02:16:29.08
limp I'm in pain but it's not too bad not yet and I'm not bleeding very much either but I'm

1394
02:16:29.08 --> 02:16:35.000
slipping away no doubt about it my biggest worry now is that I'll collapse sink beneath the surface

1395
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.68
and drown all I want to do is keep my head above water so I won't drown before I die from

1396
02:16:40.68 --> 02:16:45.88
the bullet that reamed through me I know this isn't rational what differences and make how I die

1397
02:16:45.88 --> 02:16:50.60
drowning or dying from getting my inner scrambled by a bullet either way I'm a garner and soon

1398
02:16:51.48 --> 02:16:57.16
but I'm not thinking rationally I'm thinking I've got to keep my head above water period maybe

1399
02:16:57.16 --> 02:17:03.16
10 seconds have passed since I got shot that is all in that time the man close to me

1400
02:17:03.16 --> 02:17:09.08
PFC Thomas F Sullivan has hastened to my side Lieutenant where are you hitting ass I tell him he pulls

1401
02:17:09.08 --> 02:17:16.68
up my Dungary jacket checks my wound so long as the puttons eight ball a nice guy just a teenager

1402
02:17:16.68 --> 02:17:20.84
but he's got a wild streak he's always getting in a trouble you can bet dollars to donuts when

1403
02:17:20.84 --> 02:17:25.64
he goes on liberty he lays the dick and gets arrested and afterwards spent a few days in the

1404
02:17:25.64 --> 02:17:31.48
brig is punishment this happened in New Zealand before we left for Tarrawer this happens everywhere

1405
02:17:31.48 --> 02:17:37.56
we go it's standard operating procedure for Sullivan you can put you can count on him to kick

1406
02:17:37.56 --> 02:17:43.88
up a road to put him in low key to mat for is I try to never good I know he survives a war oh

1407
02:17:43.88 --> 02:17:49.24
he definitely survives yeah and you're happy that right now he's the kind of guy that's rebellious

1408
02:17:49.24 --> 02:17:54.68
because he's dope diso-bang the orders which the orders are you keep going and he looks at you and

1409
02:17:54.68 --> 02:18:00.44
says no you know I thought as I got her so why why have somebody else die trying to help me

1410
02:18:00.44 --> 02:18:09.56
another guy joins him pft. Duffy also remember my petute and also with Tima Kiddoo does know how to

1411
02:18:09.56 --> 02:18:16.84
fall. When I returned this last time I found out where he was buried. Duffy yeah yeah

1412
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.000
and you even say you'd think you'd be happy that these guys were staying with you but you're actually

1413
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:30.60
thinking which is what they were disobeying orders and they were gonna lose their lives too.

1414
02:18:32.36 --> 02:18:36.20
And finally they say we're staying with you where do you want us to take you to the beach or to the

1415
02:18:36.20 --> 02:18:44.36
boat and you opt for the boat. Yeah. It takes about 10 minutes to reach the nearest LCVP.

1416
02:18:45.64 --> 02:18:50.36
The boats crowded with other wounded Marines other wounded men are being dragged to the boat by their

1417
02:18:50.36 --> 02:18:55.32
buddies. Evidently Sullivan and Duffy weren't the only one to ignore the order to ignore the wounded.

1418
02:18:55.32 --> 02:19:01.80
The wounded men and the rescuers are clustered in front of the ramp which is about three quarters

1419
02:19:01.80 --> 02:19:06.76
raised. One by one the wounded men are half pushed half flung over the top of the ramp after which

1420
02:19:06.76 --> 02:19:11.40
they rolled down onto the deck my turn comes. The man next to me is that big fellow with the

1421
02:19:11.40 --> 02:19:17.96
ravaged face. His wounded is terrible worse than mine. I motion for him to go before me. He is boosted

1422
02:19:17.96 --> 02:19:22.52
up to the top of the ramp. Sullivan lifts me up. I'm groaning like mad. The pain is getting worse.

1423
02:19:22.52 --> 02:19:27.96
I'm really hurting really bad now. My helpers can't quite get me over the top. I'm limp and heavy.

1424
02:19:27.96 --> 02:19:33.24
A bulky sack of flesh and bone with a hole in it and they just can't manage to raise me high enough.

1425
02:19:33.24 --> 02:19:39.32
That's when the Marine with the ravaged face performs his life saving deed. One army me into the boat.

1426
02:19:40.68 --> 02:19:45.32
How did he do that? He must be in torment from his wound but that didn't stop him from helping me.

1427
02:19:45.32 --> 02:19:52.28
I tumble groaning down onto the dock alongside the man with the ravaged face. The deck is covered

1428
02:19:52.28 --> 02:19:57.56
with the main and wounded men. Their bodies bandages and bloody many writhing and pain.

1429
02:19:57.56 --> 02:20:02.76
Many just groaning just like me. Another wounded man is taking aboard. The ramp is then

1430
02:20:02.76 --> 02:20:07.56
closed and the boat begins to move. The coxon aware that our lives are hanging. The balance

1431
02:20:07.56 --> 02:20:13.88
opens. The throttle wide and soon we're going full tilt racing through the channel in the barrier

1432
02:20:13.88 --> 02:20:23.000
reef toward the Sheridan. This description I think is the best description I've ever heard of

1433
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:28.92
of that kind of combat. Well, yeah you take a scene of small line. Your line burger is

1434
02:20:29.64 --> 02:20:34.28
he's increasing credible. He does a lot of writing. He worked with

1435
02:20:35.32 --> 02:20:42.44
a guy handed up the Chicago Tribune. He worked with him regarding the army unit that was

1436
02:20:42.44 --> 02:20:50.76
in more or more too. Then he wrote this about the Polish woman that was in the Jewish woman.

1437
02:20:51.40 --> 02:21:00.84
That was survived the time that they were almost killed. It's incredible.

1438
02:21:00.84 --> 02:21:14.20
That's the end of the tunnel of battle for you. Lasted what? 20 minutes? I guess 20 hours

1439
02:21:14.20 --> 02:21:20.68
in 20 minutes because you did the first 20 hours circle around. You give a great account

1440
02:21:21.24 --> 02:21:25.56
from all the people that were there that got interviewed.

1441
02:21:25.56 --> 02:21:36.76
The next time he's pushing in the fighting at taro. It's really all taking place at this sea wall.

1442
02:21:36.76 --> 02:21:47.32
Later on, later on he was in the motorcycle officer in the LA. He's been in accidents and

1443
02:21:47.32 --> 02:22:02.60
shot at it. He hospitalized 20 times. Oh my gosh. Yeah, these guys getting a sure a few

1444
02:22:02.60 --> 02:22:08.28
seconds later, dick steps a sure. This is what you're being loaded down the Sheraton.

1445
02:22:08.28 --> 02:22:12.36
Yes. Momently loaded. He said to himself, well, they ain't going to give me now.

1446
02:22:12.36 --> 02:22:18.44
Then he looked around in his elation evaporated nearby, led dead marine with a Japanese bayonet

1447
02:22:18.44 --> 02:22:22.92
protruding from his chest and three dead Japanese soldiers sprawled around him. Dead bodies were

1448
02:22:22.92 --> 02:22:26.68
everywhere floating in the water, piling up at the waterline, strewn about the beach.

1449
02:22:26.68 --> 02:22:30.92
Guys from the second marine to a landed the day before. Guys from the eighth marine's too.

1450
02:22:30.92 --> 02:22:35.96
And many Japanese, the beach was strewn with rifles as well as bodies and he took one off of the

1451
02:22:35.96 --> 02:22:43.80
dead marine and took the man's ammo clips as well. Now he could fight back. And then another

1452
02:22:43.80 --> 02:22:48.12
guy named Hester, Hester, collected his men and led them back to the sea wall. They found the perfect

1453
02:22:48.12 --> 02:22:54.84
example of taking leadership. This Hester called Big Hester. What happened with him? Well,

1454
02:22:54.84 --> 02:23:02.92
he's able to gather people together and they let go. That's the guy is not how much

1455
02:23:02.92 --> 02:23:08.60
it's on Mars. I say about him. I mean, there were two brothers. One brother was killed. His younger

1456
02:23:08.60 --> 02:23:16.04
brother was killed on Guadalcanel, but the time when I was killed. Well, you start talking here

1457
02:23:16.04 --> 02:23:23.08
about him and Hester and then Murdoch. Yeah. And he said, Hester, they found Murdoch near a wrecked

1458
02:23:23.08 --> 02:23:27.72
damn track in the mad rush to reach the sea wall and jump over it. Duffy somehow got separated

1459
02:23:27.72 --> 02:23:32.36
from the group and they never saw him again. Never saw him. He was killed. The guy that saved

1460
02:23:32.36 --> 02:23:36.44
your life sitting with his back the wall taking a breather dick looked over the cord the shore

1461
02:23:36.44 --> 02:23:41.08
immediately behind Murdoch. The incoming waves washed the dead marines onto the shore and pushed

1462
02:23:41.08 --> 02:23:45.000
them into small piles. It looked like a little mound and at the top of that mound facing the

1463
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:48.76
sky was Anthony Boyle. His helmet was off in the top of his head. He was shot on the ground.

1464
02:23:48.76 --> 02:23:55.80
On that same oil. A number of years ago, Murdoch, I and another one or two, went to a big

1465
02:23:55.80 --> 02:24:04.12
memorial for him in New York. Overlooking the Hudson. And we had one Lieutenant General

1466
02:24:04.84 --> 02:24:13.000
Boomer was with us and he was one of the spokesman for the fighting in the jury involved in.

1467
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:21.64
He was a guy and the main guy. So he was there with us. But we had a big ceremony in a big

1468
02:24:21.64 --> 02:24:30.12
Catholic church. We had a parade downtown. So the downtown was a big event. And this is what

1469
02:24:30.12 --> 02:24:37.88
happened to him. That's what happened to him. Is. Yeah. Only seconds before Oboil had been standing

1470
02:24:37.88 --> 02:24:42.20
next to Murdoch period over the world. Then a Japanese bullet took off the top of his head and he fell

1471
02:24:42.20 --> 02:24:47.48
back into John's arm. John created Oboil in his arms for a long moment before laying him gently

1472
02:24:47.48 --> 02:24:52.52
aside. Someone else must have hauled him up to the pile of bodies at the water's edge to get away

1473
02:24:52.52 --> 02:24:57.72
from the wall. During this time, someone from the company passed Dick's position and informed

1474
02:24:57.72 --> 02:25:01.72
that Duffy had been killed. Duffy was a very quiet person. Never talked to him much, but it really

1475
02:25:01.72 --> 02:25:09.56
nice to hear. Dick remembered. He was a little older than the most of us in his earlier mid-20s,

1476
02:25:09.56 --> 02:25:15.16
which made him an old man in our outfit. He was Oboil's best buddy. Now they were both dead

1477
02:25:15.16 --> 02:25:27.000
killed within minutes of each other. For everyone involved Americans, Japanese, there's a peculiar,

1478
02:25:27.80 --> 02:25:31.96
peculiar nasty way to fight a war. The situation favored the defenders, but only two

1479
02:25:31.96 --> 02:25:36.84
appoint battles are won, not by staying in fortifications that are won by attacking. And on

1480
02:25:36.84 --> 02:25:41.64
Baygio, the Marines, we never saw the enemy. Because they were there soon, he had to hear from

1481
02:25:41.64 --> 02:25:47.96
a, from a whole out of a hole somewhere. They had to assault each and every Japanese position,

1482
02:25:47.96 --> 02:25:52.84
making short rushes across open ground through murderous fire. Heavy casualties were the result,

1483
02:25:52.84 --> 02:25:58.60
but ultimately, Japanese casualties were heavier. In fact, almost total. The Japanese would not yield

1484
02:25:58.60 --> 02:26:03.72
because their military ethos forbade it to beat them. You had to kill them. But the Marines

1485
02:26:03.72 --> 02:26:09.000
would not quit, and they could not be stopped. Against the foes, such as the Marines with their

1486
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.60
absolute determination and capability to win, the initial advantages enjoyed by defenders fighting

1487
02:26:14.60 --> 02:26:21.08
from a concealment could have won outcome. A annihilation. Now I have a, I have a book here written

1488
02:26:21.08 --> 02:26:29.64
by one of the Japanese defenders. And I wanted to meet him when I went there and met two other

1489
02:26:29.64 --> 02:26:35.24
Japanese officers. But we never, we never, we never actually able to get together. We were on a

1490
02:26:35.24 --> 02:26:43.32
phone. But the name, the name we were called, I'll see what they called, called Heavenly,

1491
02:26:44.28 --> 02:26:50.04
something rather. They believed that I went to a heaven too. There's a different kind of heaven.

1492
02:26:50.84 --> 02:26:59.40
And they died. Continuant all of this. Yes, yes, a coney shrine for one place.

1493
02:26:59.40 --> 02:27:04.60
OK. You know, the officers, especially, we will be again in the S. Coney shrine.

1494
02:27:05.32 --> 02:27:10.84
And this one officer that I met on Guadalconeo and who I got in a real well, we

1495
02:27:10.84 --> 02:27:21.08
we of course, minor for about 15 years. And talked a lot about the, I learned a lot about their,

1496
02:27:21.88 --> 02:27:25.72
their whole background of their Bouchito code. No, let's talk.

1497
02:27:25.72 --> 02:27:32.12
I've read on this podcast. I've read some of letters that the Kamakaze pilots would write.

1498
02:27:32.12 --> 02:27:36.84
Because they would write a letter before they would go and die. Yeah. And, and there's also,

1499
02:27:37.88 --> 02:27:44.92
there's also talk of how like they would write these letters. But some of them were not writing

1500
02:27:44.92 --> 02:27:50.28
from the heart. Yeah, what? And as they, when they, when they die, sometimes they would cut off their fingernails.

1501
02:27:50.28 --> 02:27:55.96
And that would be sent back. Now, this one, this one, one fellow who had just been killed,

1502
02:27:55.96 --> 02:28:01.40
he was in a go for like hole, who just starting our final drive. And that's where I,

1503
02:28:01.40 --> 02:28:08.36
I got the diary from him and the thousand, whole, a stitched belt. And all that kind of stuff.

1504
02:28:08.36 --> 02:28:19.80
And anyway, I had the, I had a little, little piece of part of a hair that had long to

1505
02:28:21.40 --> 02:28:26.04
think and long to his, his girlfriend or something. Anyway, I just want to send all that back.

1506
02:28:27.08 --> 02:28:33.96
And that, when, when the, when the soldier was killed, the life, and that would have been his wife.

1507
02:28:33.96 --> 02:28:39.96
The wife is supposed to take care of his family. Instead, she had remarried. She felt bad about it.

1508
02:28:39.96 --> 02:28:45.64
When she saw this, saw what he had written, but one of her remarried. What did you understand me?

1509
02:28:45.64 --> 02:28:47.24
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1510
02:28:52.92 --> 02:28:59.40
Again, jumping ahead a little bit, because people need to get the books, they can read it for themselves.

1511
02:28:59.40 --> 02:29:03.24
But the casually told was nothing less than catastrophic. The New Zealand, the company,

1512
02:29:03.24 --> 02:29:07.64
had been beefed up into a little more than 200 men to give it an extra punch in the assault.

1513
02:29:07.64 --> 02:29:13.000
90 were lost, killed, or wounded in the Bayesian Lagoon. In other words, nearly half the company was

1514
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:19.56
out of action before anyone stepped ashore. The men Murdoch found on the beach were all exhausted.

1515
02:29:19.56 --> 02:29:23.08
And with the terrible look on their face, that's according to Murdoch. But their shocking

1516
02:29:23.08 --> 02:29:27.96
exhaust did not could not concern him. What I was more interested in was who's alive and who I

1517
02:29:27.96 --> 02:29:34.04
have I got. What have I got? To make that assessment, he continued rounding up the guys in the beach

1518
02:29:34.04 --> 02:29:35.96
and taking them back to his area.

1519
02:29:41.24 --> 02:29:44.76
All the wild Vietnamese fire was flailing on the beach, John ignored it. When Anthony

1520
02:29:44.76 --> 02:29:49.80
Oboil was shot and fell into his arms, he wasn't faced. And once he laid Oboil,

1521
02:29:49.80 --> 02:29:54.60
Oboil's twitching body aside, he didn't think about him anymore that day. He didn't have time,

1522
02:29:54.60 --> 02:29:58.76
much less the inclination to grieve for Oboil or to feel horror for the slow,

1523
02:29:58.76 --> 02:30:04.76
hideous way of all of that. See at that point of time, our battalion, especially our company,

1524
02:30:05.48 --> 02:30:14.76
led by Murdoch, were wiping out the last resistance. It was a hard, it was really a

1525
02:30:16.36 --> 02:30:21.000
real determined group fighting there. And that's where we lost right now. One of the people

1526
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:26.92
that's in this picture here, he got shot by fellow down in a hole like a little spider hole

1527
02:30:26.92 --> 02:30:32.44
where he caught. And up in his gut killed him instantly. He died thinking that he died, thinking that

1528
02:30:32.44 --> 02:30:43.000
I'd be just been killed. I visit his family in Tennessee afterwards and they were still so sad that

1529
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:52.68
they didn't even want to hear more about it. Didn't even want to talk to me about it. Progress is

1530
02:30:52.68 --> 02:30:56.76
eventually made toward the middle of the day, Bill noticed that seems things seem to be going a

1531
02:30:56.76 --> 02:31:00.84
little bit better for the Marines. They seem to be making some progress. Bulldozers had landed by

1532
02:31:00.84 --> 02:31:06.20
that. And they pushed up against the pillbox entrances, sealing them and intuming the Japanese

1533
02:31:06.20 --> 02:31:11.000
inside. But the flame throwers really did the trick. A flame thrower on. So one of those

1534
02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:18.44
that was inside, I ran into the first time returned, first time I returned to Terala. And he had been

1535
02:31:18.44 --> 02:31:25.32
been in the Navy for many, many years, probably a little over 20 years. And he was in charge of the

1536
02:31:25.32 --> 02:31:33.80
mess area. And then he had been transferred from there to New Guinea just before we landed. That's

1537
02:31:33.80 --> 02:31:39.64
why how he survived. Oh, so he so just before he landed, he had been transferred. Yeah, he had been

1538
02:31:39.64 --> 02:31:44.12
gone. Well, he, you know, maybe a month before some period of time. Right, right. That's the only

1539
02:31:44.12 --> 02:31:49.48
reason. So he wrote that. So now here he is, he returned, same time, I'm idea, and I met him,

1540
02:31:49.48 --> 02:31:56.68
you know. And I showed him the picture of the one, the one, the Japanese soldier that, what they

1541
02:31:56.68 --> 02:32:02.52
do with they put, they put their toll in the, and pull the trigger of the rifle, and point

1542
02:32:02.52 --> 02:32:08.76
it right up there, I've got him out. And he was doing that. And he saw that. And he, the reaction

1543
02:32:08.76 --> 02:32:13.08
from there was already something. It was for you something. And he saw that picture, he says, yeah.

1544
02:32:14.12 --> 02:32:27.88
Yeah, there's been a lot. Man. Here's what here's what Murdoch says as the, as the fighting kind of comes to

1545
02:32:27.88 --> 02:32:33.96
an end. As they get to the end, all of a sudden things began to move. We were moving, but very,

1546
02:32:33.96 --> 02:32:38.12
very slowly like a snail. My guys would go out ahead of me. Then they'd be moving and I'd run up

1547
02:32:38.12 --> 02:32:43.64
with my gang and get behind them. We were all very close. The enemy, a matter of feet, not yards. It

1548
02:32:43.64 --> 02:32:48.36
was small, very slow progress. But it was progress nonetheless. For the first time since they landed

1549
02:32:48.36 --> 02:32:53.24
the day before, the men of B company were advancing and not falling back after each forward push.

1550
02:32:53.24 --> 02:32:57.80
The Japanese meant to fight to the last man, and they were coming ever closer to realizing that

1551
02:32:57.80 --> 02:33:02.84
goal. Marine assault teams mostly add hawk assemblages, destroyed the enemy bunkers one after

1552
02:33:02.84 --> 02:33:07.72
another, killing the Japanese while they're inside, or when they ran out, the Japanese were

1553
02:33:07.72 --> 02:33:12.68
literally slain in heaps, as their numbers were reduced, so as the volume and intensity of their

1554
02:33:12.68 --> 02:33:18.04
fire. Finally, when John and his men in advance as far as they could, the battle just sort of

1555
02:33:18.04 --> 02:33:22.76
Petered out. The shooting stopped bringing silence to their sector of the battlefield and leaving

1556
02:33:22.76 --> 02:33:28.52
everyone stunned by the abrupt end to the fighting. They didn't know quite what to do, we just kind of

1557
02:33:28.52 --> 02:33:37.16
sat there and did nothing. The next day, first battalion marched over to the pier where the LCVB

1558
02:33:37.16 --> 02:33:44.60
waited to take them back to the Sheridan. On their way, they witnessed a dual flag raising ceremony

1559
02:33:44.60 --> 02:33:48.84
for the stars and stripes in the British Union Jack with a representative from his Majesty's

1560
02:33:48.84 --> 02:33:53.88
government presiding. The stars and stripes went up first, but the Union Jack was given the place

1561
02:33:53.88 --> 02:33:58.76
of pride and honor on a higher pole and acknowledgement of the British sovereignty over the Taroa

1562
02:33:58.76 --> 02:34:03.64
toll. There were some muddled complaints for the men of the one eight, but not much.

1563
02:34:03.64 --> 02:34:10.28
Most just smiled grimly and shook their heads. Great Britain may have held the title to Bejio,

1564
02:34:10.92 --> 02:34:14.68
but the Marine Corps truly owned it. Well, I recurrent the first time.

1565
02:34:14.68 --> 02:34:27.40
I recurrent the first time in 82 and I stayed with missionaries there for a couple of days or more.

1566
02:34:27.40 --> 02:34:36.52
Then during that time, we all decided to, okay, there was the breakaway and that church group.

1567
02:34:37.16 --> 02:34:44.28
Part of it is going to another church just a thatch type of a place and walking hand walk through

1568
02:34:44.28 --> 02:34:56.04
some kind of a jungle area to get there. They had it, we sat down and I spoke and asked him to

1569
02:34:56.04 --> 02:35:01.40
sing and they just loved to sing. And then it's not, you got to sing the Marine Hill.

1570
02:35:03.32 --> 02:35:12.12
Then what happened was I didn't really sing it. I said, now we'll sing it. The words, I mean,

1571
02:35:12.12 --> 02:35:25.56
we'll sing the tune of it. It was a love song based on a hymn. It was kind of two iterations of

1572
02:35:25.56 --> 02:35:30.20
apparently and then I had to then I told him a little bit about, well, you know, that's interesting.

1573
02:35:30.76 --> 02:35:34.44
And I said, down, these words and I went through the words to a certain extent.

1574
02:35:38.04 --> 02:35:42.04
Well, that was so interesting. But here they sang that song that was the love song. Like

1575
02:35:42.04 --> 02:35:49.80
same as our Marine Hill. Oh, then after that, I invited him over to the other church that they

1576
02:35:49.80 --> 02:35:57.000
had spent off from and I had got a hold of the film that was done by a government norm hatch.

1577
02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.96
He was recently died away. He's one took all these pictures. Come back photos. It was

1578
02:36:01.96 --> 02:36:11.16
inverted by the way. And anyway, I played that for them and it showed that flag rising and these kids,

1579
02:36:11.40 --> 02:36:17.64
they all scythe and the Marine Hill flag and they were real quiet. The British flag one just like

1580
02:36:17.64 --> 02:36:29.08
was described in here. Here's the results. The battle for Bayesian lasted 76 hours. Some 4,690

1581
02:36:29.08 --> 02:36:36.04
Japanese troops, about 97% of the garrison died. A mere 17 Japanese were taken prisoner

1582
02:36:36.60 --> 02:36:42.60
as were 129 laborers. The second, these most of these were Korean laborers. Yeah. The

1583
02:36:42.60 --> 02:36:49.16
second Marine Division suffered 3,407 casualties of these 1,150 Marines and sailors were killed

1584
02:36:49.16 --> 02:36:56.28
in another 2,292 were wounded. These Salt units lost 41% of their men dead and wounded.

1585
02:36:56.92 --> 02:37:01.64
The first Patanian 8th Marines lost more than 30% of its men just getting to the beach.

1586
02:37:02.76 --> 02:37:06.36
There's probably, there could be as many as 400 still there. Three or 400,

1587
02:37:06.36 --> 02:37:13.80
still there, because they're under homes under park and lots and so on. Overall, the battalion suffered

1588
02:37:13.80 --> 02:37:22.36
343 casualties on their naked. When I was there, the third time. And here the archaeologist

1589
02:37:22.36 --> 02:37:30.36
was brushing about brushing off the bones and on this one person, no, that and two of the two of them

1590
02:37:30.36 --> 02:37:37.88
they found wedding rings on their, something huh? And I saw that as they were doing it. Yeah.

1591
02:37:40.28 --> 02:37:46.20
casualties in my platoon were 12 killed and 15 wounded, including myself 75% of its original

1592
02:37:46.20 --> 02:37:57.08
strength, most were hit while waiting to shore. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. And you can look at the faces of all

1593
02:37:57.08 --> 02:38:04.44
these that were killed in this one photograph. And you talk about the news clipping,

1594
02:38:04.44 --> 02:38:10.12
sort of the news stories that were reported about Taram. Yeah. Okay. And part of it, I always was told

1595
02:38:11.40 --> 02:38:16.44
that they released some of these, it was the first time that they really released a lot of

1596
02:38:16.44 --> 02:38:21.08
events. It's a very, very long one that one that general public realized, you know, this is not going

1597
02:38:21.08 --> 02:38:29.56
to be easy. This is what it's really like. Just terrific combat photos, home and credible.

1598
02:38:29.56 --> 02:38:34.76
Yeah. And those were the first ones showing mass casualties in my arrogance. Yeah. You, you've

1599
02:38:34.76 --> 02:38:39.24
probably seen that one. Oh, yeah, I've seen it. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, Norm Hatch. Just wanted to do that.

1600
02:38:39.24 --> 02:38:44.84
Oh, so that is him. Okay. Norm Hatch. Oh, yeah. I got no real well. Yeah.

1601
02:38:44.84 --> 02:38:52.84
All right. And in the end, we just read this book, I published, was there's a Colonel Alexander,

1602
02:38:52.84 --> 02:38:59.16
Joseph Alexander died the last, in the last year for years. Anyway, he was the, he was the

1603
02:38:59.96 --> 02:39:07.08
prime historian for the Marine Corps. And, and then he was very well thought of

1604
02:39:07.08 --> 02:39:14.68
the name of the list to press. So when it came to making a proposal to enable us to press,

1605
02:39:14.68 --> 02:39:22.76
it had to go through their, uh, through their border review scene. And then after that, no, I

1606
02:39:22.76 --> 02:39:27.24
seen that. It had to go through, it had to go through your, when it, what's the word for it?

1607
02:39:27.96 --> 02:39:33.88
Somebody has the same, same mountain as you do. I pretty much, anyway, this Joseph Alexander

1608
02:39:33.88 --> 02:39:39.24
was one of the prime ones that did, did, did it when my peer review. Okay. And then when that,

1609
02:39:39.24 --> 02:39:47.80
so that when that got to the, to the review board, oh, he says, fine. So I'd just say,

1610
02:39:47.80 --> 02:39:54.68
you're laying on through, you know. And then now, my book was on the first ones to go on as

1611
02:39:54.68 --> 02:40:02.36
an ebook, first ones for the press. And I have the ads or some of the, the, the, the proceeds magazine.

1612
02:40:02.36 --> 02:40:08.76
Yeah. That shows, shows that they're displayed. One of them is with, uh, with Papay going to,

1613
02:40:08.76 --> 02:40:13.32
is on that same page with him. Well, yeah, this is available on ebook for those of you that

1614
02:40:13.32 --> 02:40:17.40
want to get it, and can't wait to get it. You get immediately. Just go straight to ebook.

1615
02:40:17.40 --> 02:40:21.80
Not only that. Yeah, that too. And not only that. When they go through, and it goes through, and it

1616
02:40:21.80 --> 02:40:29.56
goes up, going through email, I read to, uh, what's, what is it, uh, Amazon.com. It'll be delivery,

1617
02:40:29.56 --> 02:40:34.84
you know, matter about three days or less. And, and, and, no, no shipping costs.

1618
02:40:35.64 --> 02:40:42.04
Yeah, that's the way Amazon works. Oh, it's an amazing deal. I do. I don't understand. Yeah. And,

1619
02:40:42.04 --> 02:40:49.32
I don't know if there's, there's, but that's where I got my copies. So, yeah, you can get, I have

1620
02:40:49.32 --> 02:40:53.56
the hardcover and the softcover. Yeah, both. Yes. I don't play around with the music. You know,

1621
02:40:53.56 --> 02:41:00.36
when you get ebooks, they cost three versus three quarters of much as a, uh, one of those. Yeah.

1622
02:41:01.40 --> 02:41:09.64
That's, the publishing world is very strange. Taking it now to where you get onto the

1623
02:41:09.64 --> 02:41:14.92
Sheridan. So now this is, this is, uh, no sooner than my stretcher touched down on the Sheridan's deck

1624
02:41:14.92 --> 02:41:19.56
that I was west away into the operating room. I was one of the first wounded marines to be treated

1625
02:41:19.56 --> 02:41:23.80
and the medical team was fresh and rested and ready to go to work on me. I guess that qualifies as

1626
02:41:23.80 --> 02:41:29.64
a stroke of good luck. Even better fortunate awaited me in the operating room in the form of

1627
02:41:29.64 --> 02:41:36.84
lieutenant commander Lloyd Sussex formally an abdominal, an abdominal specialist at the Mayo Clinic.

1628
02:41:37.88 --> 02:41:41.32
Now the key member of three-man team, Dr. Two doctors in a corpsman that would say,

1629
02:41:41.32 --> 02:41:45.72
there you go. How lucky is that you had a guy. Unbelievable. And, I'm part of the shift.

1630
02:41:45.72 --> 02:41:52.92
And that's all there was. And if I gone unsure, I would have died. And most other places you,

1631
02:41:52.92 --> 02:41:57.56
you wouldn't have an abdominal specialist. And then it says the operation last about an hour.

1632
02:41:57.56 --> 02:42:01.16
I was conscious the whole time and didn't feel any pain. No, they didn't want their put me out because

1633
02:42:01.16 --> 02:42:07.64
I died. I was in shock. And the doctor spent most of that hour bent over my lower body.

1634
02:42:08.04 --> 02:42:10.84
And although I could not see what they were doing, I could hear a little clicking and

1635
02:42:10.84 --> 02:42:15.24
sniffing sounds made by their instruments as they worked. They repaired my bladder and removed

1636
02:42:15.24 --> 02:42:19.56
a portion of my large intestine and gave me a blood transfusion. Then they closed my wound and that was

1637
02:42:19.56 --> 02:42:25.16
that. Yeah, and didn't need a half of a bay of afterwards. I had made it through surgery. But

1638
02:42:25.16 --> 02:42:29.88
he'd been a close call. Dr. Sussex told me that I could not have survived another two hours

1639
02:42:29.88 --> 02:42:33.64
because of the toxins that were building up inside. And that right after the right after the

1640
02:42:33.64 --> 02:42:40.76
operation I was kept in a hot, covered tent. And it was miserable. I kept trying to shove it off

1641
02:42:40.76 --> 02:42:45.16
they had they had a carman sitting there with me all night long to keep me even throwing it off.

1642
02:42:46.76 --> 02:42:51.48
And then another couple of days I was able to walk into the watch and move me with their

1643
02:42:51.48 --> 02:42:55.48
blood. People couldn't be here. I was walking in there to see the movie. They couldn't believe it.

1644
02:42:55.48 --> 02:43:00.76
I mean you were as good as dad. Got shot in. Unbelievable. Not even to the beach yet.

1645
02:43:00.76 --> 02:43:07.64
Yeah, they had very people survive period. I got shot. Very few. Because he told me he said

1646
02:43:07.64 --> 02:43:13.80
I talked to him later and said, yeah, you know the poison in your system. You wouldn't

1647
02:43:13.80 --> 02:43:19.40
you wouldn't have lasted another couple more. No hour or two that was it. And here's up in an hour

1648
02:43:19.40 --> 02:43:26.04
about an hour or an hour or an hour after I was hit. I was just unbelievable.

1649
02:43:26.04 --> 02:43:31.32
There's unbelievable. You say a few days later I was checked over by a younger doctor, a gloomy

1650
02:43:31.32 --> 02:43:35.40
fellow with a bit with a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a match. You told me don't flu that my wound

1651
02:43:35.40 --> 02:43:40.44
was very serious and that I wouldn't live much past my 50s. Yeah. Well, sort of doctor says such

1652
02:43:40.44 --> 02:43:45.08
that they do his patients. I reported his words to Dr. Soxix, who's who's appalled.

1653
02:43:45.08 --> 02:43:48.68
He shouldn't have told you that. Soxix said and there's no truth through it anyways. And I guess

1654
02:43:48.68 --> 02:43:53.80
we're improving that right now. Soxix, if you're talking about it. Well, now what happened to him?

1655
02:43:54.60 --> 02:43:59.64
A year later he was operating on a guy at Ferregette Naval Training Center. This is Soxix.

1656
02:43:59.64 --> 02:44:04.04
Yes. And here he's about 55 years old. He died of a heart attack. He was

1657
02:44:04.04 --> 02:44:08.28
operating on that guy. And I've talked, I've talked in Mayo Clinic about that. And then

1658
02:44:08.28 --> 02:44:12.68
there's people that are written up a lot of history about that. They written a little bit about

1659
02:44:12.68 --> 02:44:19.40
Sussex. And I gave a lot of information too. But so anyway, that's this end of the story all with him.

1660
02:44:20.76 --> 02:44:24.44
In, uh, lad, like you said, you come walking up their plane of moving.

1661
02:44:24.44 --> 02:44:27.56
Yeah. Yeah. You know, the best that you come walking about up my buddies could hardly prove

1662
02:44:27.56 --> 02:44:30.84
believe their eyes. Oh my god, look, here's lad. They did the exclaimed.

1663
02:44:30.84 --> 02:44:33.80
Yeah. Yeah. First they thought I was dead. Then they were told those grieves he wounded all

1664
02:44:33.80 --> 02:44:38.12
to her up a basket case. And now here I was walking into the movie theater. How many days

1665
02:44:38.12 --> 02:44:46.92
it have been? It couldn't have been more three days. Oh, man. Uh, while I was

1666
02:44:46.92 --> 02:44:50.76
really, you know, all was in a hospital. They must get around. It's fast as possible. Anyway.

1667
02:44:50.76 --> 02:44:55.64
Okay. Yeah. While I was recovering from my surgery, John Murdoch dropped by to give me a

1668
02:44:55.64 --> 02:45:01.000
samurai sword. He had survived. He had proven near to unbezier. Yeah. Hold it from me until I returned.

1669
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:06.12
He said he assumed that I'd gotten a million dollar wound. It would be sent home. I thought the same.

1670
02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.20
Left unspoken, but implicit and what he said was that he didn't think you'd be coming home.

1671
02:45:12.20 --> 02:45:18.12
The sword was probably mine to keep. Yeah. He was, it was, his was a common sentiment.

1672
02:45:19.24 --> 02:45:23.88
I would venture to say that after Taroa, most second division Marines didn't believe

1673
02:45:23.88 --> 02:45:28.12
they would make it through the war. Yeah. Because you're looking at the entire rest of the island

1674
02:45:28.12 --> 02:45:32.84
campaigns and then you got to go into mainland Japan. And it's going to be a bloody fight the

1675
02:45:32.84 --> 02:45:40.36
whole way. Oh, boy, if they had that bomb had not dropped. It's horrible saying, but gee. Murdoch took

1676
02:45:40.36 --> 02:45:45.24
a head count of B company using a pretty battle roster for reference checking off one name after

1677
02:45:45.24 --> 02:45:51.000
the other from the list. He had known that the toll would be large, but even he was shocked by the

1678
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.88
final count. My god, he thought. Now that the chasms are listed or they're listed in there.

1679
02:45:56.68 --> 02:46:01.08
We've not there listed. They're listed in here all the casualties. What's the name of the guy that

1680
02:46:01.08 --> 02:46:06.36
uh... Yeah, they're not fully listed in here. What's his name uh... wrote the book, the story of

1681
02:46:06.36 --> 02:46:12.12
the story of the battle. What's it? What is it? Anyway, I've got that whole thing.

1682
02:46:12.12 --> 02:46:22.84
They're all listed in here. One's wounded. One's it killed out right. Now this is his book by the

1683
02:46:22.84 --> 02:46:28.92
way right here. See? That's the right here. Here, that book. Sure, what? Okay. Sure,

1684
02:46:28.92 --> 02:46:33.32
right. Okay. No, you know, all of the names are all back here. So here they are. If you

1685
02:46:33.32 --> 02:46:39.16
know, they're all back in here. See this? Got it. See that? So that's where they all are.

1686
02:46:39.16 --> 02:46:46.44
And I talked to him in person and uh... it's getting okay, you know, to quote him.

1687
02:46:47.16 --> 02:46:52.68
And I said, well, I have a little difficulty with uh... with the uh... publisher.

1688
02:46:52.68 --> 02:46:57.64
Mm-hmm. Just don't pay any attention to them. So I'm giving you the okay. All right.

1689
02:47:01.80 --> 02:47:08.84
Now you guys sail to Hawaii. So you go from you go from this hell. How

1690
02:47:08.84 --> 02:47:12.76
longs take you to Hawaii? Like 20 weeks? 20 weeks? 20 weeks? 20 weeks?

1691
02:47:13.80 --> 02:47:18.28
So then you guys get to Hawaii. You guys are pure side. You're all sitting up there looking

1692
02:47:18.28 --> 02:47:25.000
pure side and a car pulls up and here we go back to the book. Outstept Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,

1693
02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:31.08
Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Air. He's getting to ascend the gangway

1694
02:47:31.08 --> 02:47:36.76
a company by an aide. His friends called him Chet. So did the Marines. The nuclear

1695
02:47:36.76 --> 02:47:42.44
experiences had given them the right. He chet, they shouted. When we go back to the states,

1696
02:47:42.44 --> 02:47:46.20
Chet, we can't wait for the Golden Gate. Does our skipper know the way to day go?

1697
02:47:47.96 --> 02:47:51.72
How about some liberty, Chet? We got to get off this tub and do some Christmas shopping.

1698
02:47:51.72 --> 02:47:58.04
And perhaps most tellingly, hey Admiral, get us someone who knows the reefs for our next landing.

1699
02:47:59.24 --> 02:48:03.72
So that's that's why. And then his driver, then the same...

1700
02:48:03.72 --> 02:48:11.000
Mark said his driver's seat. Oh yeah, you see, you guys you look like some

1701
02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.36
Hollywood guy. Yeah, you look like Hollywood guy. So that's Chet's remarks,

1702
02:48:14.36 --> 02:48:18.12
Marty. Yeah, you guys must have been pretty away. But anyway, for sure.

1703
02:48:18.12 --> 02:48:23.000
Hard to control a couple off of taro. So anyway, he was, he was so glad to say these guys here.

1704
02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.000
So they're just full of it. Great. That's good. Yeah. And so here we go. Shortly after Nimitz

1705
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:37.000
departs. The PA announced that the shared would be proceeding directly to the big island.

1706
02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.64
In other words, no liberty on a wahoo. This didn't set well with the Marines.

1707
02:48:41.64 --> 02:48:46.36
And they went wild hooting and yelling and whistling, throwing all matter of junk down on the

1708
02:48:46.36 --> 02:48:51.000
dock, pelting the band and the short patrol. The band's been lowered. Their instruments

1709
02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:56.20
and accompanied by the short patrols fled to a nearby shed. The eighth Marines achieve nothing

1710
02:48:56.20 --> 02:49:00.52
with their show of angry emotions, except perhaps to blow off a lot of steam and confirm to all

1711
02:49:00.52 --> 02:49:05.32
concern parties that they should not have been given liberty. The rest was not about the turn.

1712
02:49:05.32 --> 02:49:10.52
These barbarians loose on the civilian populace of a wahoo. The civilized world wasn't ready

1713
02:49:10.52 --> 02:49:13.96
for us. And to be honest, we weren't ready for this. And like, whole life is concerned.

1714
02:49:13.96 --> 02:49:17.40
What, all I've got to do is Japanese. What are you going to do? And there's a lot of Japanese.

1715
02:49:18.44 --> 02:49:21.88
It was just as well. The brass had plans for us. The second division as a whole.

1716
02:49:21.88 --> 02:49:27.48
And these did not involve a return to the United States. First, we would go to the big island

1717
02:49:27.48 --> 02:49:32.44
to rest rebuild and then train for them. And we had to put up the tents.

1718
02:49:33.32 --> 02:49:39.000
There was no face to sleep. So they sent you guys out at the middle of a wahoo.

1719
02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.88
No, no, no. This is this is a big island. They sent you out at the middle of it where you

1720
02:49:45.88 --> 02:49:50.68
guys had to establish your own base camp. Oh yeah, yeah. We had to set up the tents and start training.

1721
02:49:50.68 --> 02:50:01.56
Oh, yeah. You get here. You get the stuff out. And then after that, the camp was used by the

1722
02:50:01.56 --> 02:50:09.32
others that eventually took Ewasima. Okay. You say here, you get the camps set up. You get a little

1723
02:50:09.32 --> 02:50:12.76
bit of downtime. And then they get you guys right into training. Our training stress to combine

1724
02:50:12.76 --> 02:50:18.84
norms approach to warfare for veterans of Bayesian and Guadalcanal many aspects of this training

1725
02:50:18.84 --> 02:50:23.32
world. But the replacements in the division we were receiving was receiving almost daily.

1726
02:50:23.32 --> 02:50:29.32
They needed all of it. Replacements are going to be in the Guadalcanalcino area. And we knew

1727
02:50:29.32 --> 02:50:33.48
we were going to use the tanks. And we knew that we were going to have to have communication

1728
02:50:33.48 --> 02:50:38.44
by a phone and the back of the tank. Okay. Yeah, this was a new modification. It was a new

1729
02:50:38.44 --> 02:50:45.24
new home. Yeah, home to the Hadoan maneuver around the strong points at all. You say that most

1730
02:50:45.24 --> 02:50:50.28
of the replacements, most were fresh, fresh teenage, fresh, and so on. Now we're starting to get

1731
02:50:50.28 --> 02:50:59.32
trapped. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you say here. Yeah. Eager kids with no combat experience and no

1732
02:50:59.32 --> 02:51:03.56
idea what they got themselves into. The rest of us just looked at them and shook our heads. We

1733
02:51:03.56 --> 02:51:07.72
did know what they had gotten themselves into. And we wondered how they would survive in the battles

1734
02:51:07.72 --> 02:51:12.52
to come. Never forgetting that our own survival thus far was due in large measure to the vagaries

1735
02:51:12.52 --> 02:51:17.32
of chance and circumstance and maybe just a little bit to the grace of God as well.

1736
02:51:17.32 --> 02:51:21.88
Luck in God's grace, we're desperately slim reads on which to hang our hopes,

1737
02:51:21.88 --> 02:51:26.52
slimmer still for the replacements because they're in experience. We expected that many would die.

1738
02:51:26.52 --> 02:51:31.16
The odds were against them because they had seen no action. But we also expected to die.

1739
02:51:31.16 --> 02:51:36.36
The odds were against us because we had seen too much action. Either way, you did the math.

1740
02:51:36.36 --> 02:51:40.36
It came out bad. Yeah. And it's the war went on for another two years. Yeah, you're a

1741
02:51:40.36 --> 02:51:46.68
hundred percent figure, you know. Yeah. Your chance of security. Yeah. Your percent. Yeah.

1742
02:51:48.36 --> 02:51:51.40
We were, oh, here you talk about the drafties. We were especially skeptical about the

1743
02:51:52.60 --> 02:51:58.28
skeptical about the drafties of which there were significant number. These were selective

1744
02:51:58.28 --> 02:52:06.44
service Marines were something new to which was previously an all-volunteer force, new and unwanted

1745
02:52:06.44 --> 02:52:10.44
and a matter of grave concern for the rest of us. Would the drafties measure up to Marine Corps

1746
02:52:10.44 --> 02:52:15.64
standards? Would we be able to depend on them in battle? We had our doubts. We were wrong to doubt

1747
02:52:15.64 --> 02:52:20.52
them in battle when the chips were down. They proved that like volunteers, they were worthy

1748
02:52:20.52 --> 02:52:29.08
be called Marines. So you eventually take over a as a 60 millimeter mortar section. Yeah, because

1749
02:52:29.08 --> 02:52:33.64
I'm still weak because you're still hurt. Yeah. And so I didn't have to get out and do a lot of

1750
02:52:33.64 --> 02:52:41.000
moving around, you see. And then, again, you cover some of this stuff in good detail on the book,

1751
02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:46.92
but then soon enough, it's your hit and cyber. I learned how to load this ship and

1752
02:52:47.88 --> 02:52:54.20
be a court recorder and all that kind of stuff. Like do these stuff? How long were you guys in Hawaii

1753
02:52:54.20 --> 02:53:01.32
for? Let me think about about six months, five months. Yeah. So you get five, did you get any

1754
02:53:01.32 --> 02:53:05.80
liberty at that time? Oh yeah. Okay, so they let's go. Yeah, we were down a heel a lot. Okay. Yeah.

1755
02:53:06.52 --> 02:53:13.72
Nice. Yeah. All right. So now you get done with that and then boom, morning, 15 June,

1756
02:53:13.72 --> 02:53:19.40
1944. Shells rained down on our salt waves. This is Sipan. Yeah, but not before we left Hawaii.

1757
02:53:20.76 --> 02:53:28.04
We had our LSTs all lined up, Sipaside. And one of them blew up a mortar shell or something

1758
02:53:28.04 --> 02:53:33.64
that we were doing some welding or something. Anyway, I'm Mercy, I'll blew up. And then

1759
02:53:33.64 --> 02:53:41.40
fires have spread from ship to ship. And we lost, I don't know, maybe could four or four hundred

1760
02:53:41.40 --> 02:53:47.40
men would lost their lives. Yeah. And that whole lineup there. That's it. And then we lost a lot of

1761
02:53:47.40 --> 02:53:52.20
equipment because of that. Did that set back the operation? Yeah, it did. It did put us, yeah.

1762
02:53:52.20 --> 02:53:57.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now that was in a place called Westlock. Yeah. You probably heard about that

1763
02:53:57.16 --> 02:54:00.60
when Hampshire. Yeah, no, and you've got a written, I did. I heard for it about because they

1764
02:54:00.60 --> 02:54:07.80
made changes to the way that they did business with regards to handling. Now this happened,

1765
02:54:07.80 --> 02:54:15.08
this happened when we were at Lenny exercises on Maui. And I think we had some, we had some

1766
02:54:15.08 --> 02:54:24.36
complications at Lenny do that whether something was. And so that was part of it. I, that was part

1767
02:54:24.36 --> 02:54:28.60
of it. But the main thing, they don't know exactly what caused the explosion, but they think

1768
02:54:28.60 --> 02:54:35.88
it probably was. What's what I just mentioned. Yeah. But guys got blew up and just got flying out.

1769
02:54:36.84 --> 02:54:42.44
And one of my friends seems he had happened to him and he was swim, swim, no, he was picked

1770
02:54:42.44 --> 02:54:50.12
up by bolt came by and had it pulled a line. So grab on. And then just drag them over to the beach,

1771
02:54:50.12 --> 02:54:56.12
you know. It's incredible. It's crazy. These vets from Gualdo Canal and Tarowen and then

1772
02:54:56.12 --> 02:55:04.76
de Paris and that was unbelievable. Yeah. But you push it back, I guess. And then you guys had

1773
02:55:04.76 --> 02:55:10.52
this iPad. And here we go, June 15, 1944. Sheels rained down on our sole waves kicking up tall

1774
02:55:10.52 --> 02:55:16.28
columns of water. Now can you imagine landing on side pan? They had all of our cheerrails set

1775
02:55:16.28 --> 02:55:25.40
on the west side of the mountain. Fire over at us. All zeroed in on the reef and along the beach.

1776
02:55:26.52 --> 02:55:32.76
All they had to do was just break back and forth. And we could even show you. And we lost so many

1777
02:55:33.40 --> 02:55:37.40
all of wounded. Our wounded were all going back and then here they got hit by all this archery

1778
02:55:37.40 --> 02:55:42.36
fire. And our pertain, a lot of what pertain commanders were wounded and killed. Because

1779
02:55:42.36 --> 02:55:51.24
there were our main our CPs were wrecked along the beach. And then our ships couldn't fire back

1780
02:55:51.24 --> 02:55:55.40
at them from that angle. They had to go clear around the outside of the island and hit them from

1781
02:55:55.40 --> 02:56:02.68
the river. That's what happened. Yeah. You say here are not only that. They had to spot her

1782
02:56:02.68 --> 02:56:10.60
on a smoke stack and it's sugar refinery. And all that was called in. Just perfect. Perfect. Yeah.

1783
02:56:12.28 --> 02:56:17.96
To my friends were killed right there in the beach. One led to death. Yeah, they're a lot

1784
02:56:17.96 --> 02:56:27.08
other. The same way. Basically it. Yeah. Yeah. This is what Murdoch said about it. Our amtrax

1785
02:56:27.08 --> 02:56:31.48
were in line to breast and we were taking our telefired. The heaviest we ever encountered.

1786
02:56:31.48 --> 02:56:36.04
Yeah. You could see the shells hitting the water exploded. Yeah. Making the water splash way up.

1787
02:56:36.04 --> 02:56:41.56
Just off to my right shell, scored a direct hit on one of my boats and pow, it just went to pieces.

1788
02:56:41.56 --> 02:56:46.60
There was a flash and a big explosion. I could see pieces of men flying out of it. I thought, oh shit.

1789
02:56:46.60 --> 02:56:52.12
But I also thought thank God it wasn't my boat. But I was mostly thinking who was it that got hit

1790
02:56:52.12 --> 02:57:01.56
and how many guys am I going to be without? Man Murdoch was a serious like marine combat leader.

1791
02:57:01.56 --> 02:57:10.28
Yeah. He got there too. Hit there too. And this is this is your this is you say this is your

1792
02:57:10.28 --> 02:57:14.44
experience. When my amtrax reached the reef we were all crouched low below the sides. There was

1793
02:57:14.44 --> 02:57:19.32
too much metal flying around the air to risk popping up for a look around. The guys had their heads

1794
02:57:19.32 --> 02:57:24.52
pulled down between their shoulders and they stared at each other with eyes. We big eyes and said nothing.

1795
02:57:24.52 --> 02:57:28.20
The veterans of Taro had been through this before and were probably having a harder time of it,

1796
02:57:28.20 --> 02:57:32.52
precisely because of their prior experience because they knew how bad things could get.

1797
02:57:32.52 --> 02:57:35.64
The new kids were mostly better off because they didn't have a clue.

1798
02:57:36.36 --> 02:57:39.96
Certainly they were scared but they were also fascinated and awestruck by all the noise and

1799
02:57:39.96 --> 02:57:44.68
commotion and these emotions blunted their fear. Nothing in their experience had prepared for them

1800
02:57:44.68 --> 02:57:50.20
for this. The live fire exercise in Hawaii were puny by comparison and so they did not realize

1801
02:57:50.20 --> 02:57:55.32
that our situation was terrible and likely to get worse. You can be sure that I was scared but

1802
02:57:55.32 --> 02:58:03.08
fortunately I had the concerns of an officer to distract me. What wave were you and what group were

1803
02:58:03.08 --> 02:58:11.24
you in? There was so many with ahead of us on the beach I landed on. We were way on the northern

1804
02:58:11.24 --> 02:58:19.48
end of the landing beach and what happened is the tide of her was forces further way to the left

1805
02:58:19.48 --> 02:58:27.000
and we had to realign a couple hundred yards further back to right again. Now thing is there's

1806
02:58:28.36 --> 02:58:34.20
we didn't have a lot of problem getting into the beach but once we got to the beach there

1807
02:58:34.20 --> 02:58:42.92
was nobody on the beach so they didn't defend themselves at the beach instead it was a heavier

1808
02:58:42.92 --> 02:58:49.64
artillery fire so they landed basically you landed through but where I was we had to cross a

1809
02:58:49.64 --> 02:58:54.44
fighter strip that they had so we had to cross and that was kind of scary going across that

1810
02:58:54.44 --> 02:59:02.84
exposed from people shooting out of the side but then as we maneuvered kept moving to the right

1811
02:59:02.84 --> 02:59:08.12
further to get back where we were supposed to be then the heavy artillery fired just all over

1812
02:59:08.12 --> 02:59:15.16
the place it was just cannon wound him or um yeah you said so many good men were killed that day

1813
02:59:15.16 --> 02:59:21.16
one of them was first lieutenant new old teacher yeah he was a four-year school teacher

1814
02:59:21.16 --> 02:59:26.68
former school teacher you know when I went on one on the I'm never did together a lot in

1815
02:59:26.68 --> 02:59:32.60
New Zealand yeah shell fragment sliced off one of his legs no country be found to help him yeah he

1816
02:59:32.60 --> 02:59:43.16
did it died no other than the same time oh yeah that's his from moral artery pumped the last of his

1817
02:59:43.16 --> 02:59:47.16
blood on to the sand he looked up at those gout around him and whispered get them in off the beach

1818
02:59:47.16 --> 02:59:54.68
yeah yeah yeah because more the fire was coming in we're on the same time John we saw these guns

1819
02:59:54.68 --> 03:00:00.60
by the way when we return up there those guns are still up there two of them are and now it's

1820
03:00:00.60 --> 03:00:06.36
it's a Japanese memorial and that these are part of the memorial up there yeah I I mentioned to you

1821
03:00:06.36 --> 03:00:11.32
that I was just saying I'm too this is right above a physical sandbass city in the city yeah

1822
03:00:11.32 --> 03:00:16.36
right up there I don't know if we I don't know specifically because no I don't know I don't know

1823
03:00:16.36 --> 03:00:21.24
talk of that hill as you get it was a big night above on the top now it'd be just in the

1824
03:00:21.24 --> 03:00:26.92
North towards Shepard shell yeah it's just that that's where the that's where these these are

1825
03:00:26.92 --> 03:00:34.36
this artillery is however and then then down to the left there's the monsters monsters that

1826
03:00:35.96 --> 03:00:43.08
dig out of where they they got the coral the coral gravel or sand to make the airport with

1827
03:00:43.08 --> 03:00:49.72
now that all got filled in with Japanese tanks and and and the amphibian tractors they're all buried

1828
03:00:49.72 --> 03:00:54.84
right in there you probably didn't see it because it's all been buried but I got a picture picture

1829
03:00:54.84 --> 03:01:05.88
I mean one book here I want to look like before they recovered up so I was here when when

1830
03:01:05.88 --> 03:01:12.84
your friend knew was it new no no you said around the same time John Murdach John Murdach was

1831
03:01:12.84 --> 03:01:19.56
running up the beach after disembarking from his amtrak came across Gus Kriger Kriger

1832
03:01:19.56 --> 03:01:24.28
of one of B company's veteran first we tendons in a close friend he's who was lying on the ground

1833
03:01:24.28 --> 03:01:29.80
I've got his picture here yeah his body perforated by shrapnel he was alive but just barely

1834
03:01:29.80 --> 03:01:35.08
John now beside his friend I looked at him to see what I could do for him John recall but he was

1835
03:01:35.08 --> 03:01:39.96
bleeding and so many places I knew I couldn't do anything he wanted to cigarette so I gave him one

1836
03:01:39.96 --> 03:01:46.28
I let that form and I said Gus you'll be okay I got to go I had to go there was too much to

1837
03:01:46.28 --> 03:01:52.68
do I had to get the company organized and I left him there so he died there I've visited his wife

1838
03:01:52.68 --> 03:02:00.76
back afterwards he was later lost within the span of a few minutes John had lost two of his

1839
03:02:00.76 --> 03:02:04.76
season to put two leaders also wounded and put out of action were the second and third battalion

1840
03:02:04.76 --> 03:02:11.88
commanders we tend to crumble Henry P. Jim Crow you heard him and Jim Crow yeah legendary

1841
03:02:11.88 --> 03:02:16.84
he was the former commander of the scout sniper school that you did and also we

1842
03:02:16.84 --> 03:02:22.12
tended John Miller, Lieutenant Colonel John Miller so both the battalion commanders out of

1843
03:02:22.12 --> 03:02:32.44
action yeah from that artillery yeah man yeah you're again you know it looks

1844
03:02:32.44 --> 03:02:37.24
sort of hopeless so that's stage just seeming hopeless here we're catching heavy artillery fire

1845
03:02:37.24 --> 03:02:41.56
and we couldn't do anything about it you know it's it's I like I like bringing up these points in the

1846
03:02:41.56 --> 03:02:45.16
book where you talk about things like this while that's all that's happening you say meanwhile

1847
03:02:45.16 --> 03:02:49.64
I lay in the brush with my man and try to free myself from the despair that suddenly gripped

1848
03:02:49.64 --> 03:02:55.16
me the situation seemed hopeless it was Tarua all over again how I wonder do we gonna get out of

1849
03:02:55.16 --> 03:03:00.76
this mess exactly my feelings at that time and then you say the feelings soon passed I just didn't

1850
03:03:00.76 --> 03:03:06.52
have time for it at my command we moved out everyone rose from their shell holes and craters

1851
03:03:06.52 --> 03:03:11.88
and went forward no hesitation imagine from the bushy strip we lumbered about 10 feet to the

1852
03:03:11.88 --> 03:03:16.36
air strip keep going keep going ahead myself shouting don't stop it's good I like to bring

1853
03:03:16.36 --> 03:03:22.84
those points up because there's several times where you talk about you as a leader have to kind of

1854
03:03:22.84 --> 03:03:28.52
get yourself together and and I think what that's helpful for for is young leaders in the military

1855
03:03:28.52 --> 03:03:33.000
that are gonna feel that same thing if they get into tough situation okay you got to recognize it

1856
03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:42.12
and then you got to take action young 23 year old with all that responsibility I got so then

1857
03:03:42.84 --> 03:03:51.08
next day I got got strapped off my own motors hit hit the leaves up above us and went off

1858
03:03:55.08 --> 03:04:00.60
I didn't report it it just I got entered entered up and there's still air or there goes still there

1859
03:04:00.60 --> 03:04:08.84
I didn't report it yeah you guys are pushing forward and then you guys get kind of a

1860
03:04:10.12 --> 03:04:15.48
a skirmish line and then the Japanese counterattack several points along our line

1861
03:04:16.04 --> 03:04:21.56
Don mains he recalled this they bonds out across the gas dang swamp and we just shot him up

1862
03:04:21.56 --> 03:04:25.80
the swamp was marshy water and you remember it's a physical suicide he likes a

1863
03:04:25.80 --> 03:04:30.92
super I don't remember it's a swampy area and what happened is one of the other officers

1864
03:04:30.92 --> 03:04:36.44
in our battalion he was like a soldier for a type of a guy and he'd been with a pretty

1865
03:04:36.44 --> 03:04:42.52
state army as an ambulance driver and north Africa and we just figured well he's either going to be

1866
03:04:42.52 --> 03:04:47.40
a hero or he's gonna get killed one the other and he got killed what happened was that that

1867
03:04:47.40 --> 03:04:53.96
we were we're at this spot and there are a lot of Japanese on the other side not exposing himself yet

1868
03:04:53.96 --> 03:04:58.36
but he's trying to get it he walked out of head trying to get him and exposing himself he thought

1869
03:04:58.36 --> 03:05:04.92
they were he getting him a surrender and instead this one guy being over had received him

1870
03:05:04.92 --> 03:05:17.72
and strapped his back killed him yeah a lot of guys a lot of casualties and and actually

1871
03:05:17.72 --> 03:05:26.20
at this point there's another casualty and it's a guy by the name of John Murdoch and this story

1872
03:05:26.20 --> 03:05:34.76
is about as good of a story as I've ever heard about the military as a whole so here we go this is

1873
03:05:34.76 --> 03:05:40.84
around this time John Murdoch also became a casualty hit while landing B company hit while

1874
03:05:40.84 --> 03:05:47.40
leading B company on a sweep west of the landing strip down toward Sharan Konoa yeah

1875
03:05:47.40 --> 03:05:54.36
Sharan Konoa and this is so this is John Murdoch now it's called it's really is a

1876
03:05:54.36 --> 03:06:03.08
shalin shalin Konoa they couldn't they couldn't pronounce they couldn't fence their

1877
03:06:03.08 --> 03:06:12.68
are so we call Sharon Konoa so here's John Murdoch talk in fact all of our past signs

1878
03:06:12.68 --> 03:06:18.44
had a lot of wires in her teeth and that's where Roger comes from right yeah like when we say Roger could

1879
03:06:18.44 --> 03:06:24.04
be I was told that that's possible I had thought that it's possible yeah that's the original

1880
03:06:24.04 --> 03:06:29.24
usage was that we knew if someone says Roger you know it was on quite on Guadalcanale Murdoch

1881
03:06:29.24 --> 03:06:36.28
was in there was was taking a piss and here Japanese come come in they don't know if I

1882
03:06:36.28 --> 03:06:44.12
caught sure not is an engineer in one of our interpreters oh you read out a second take I don't

1883
03:06:44.12 --> 03:06:50.92
know how you mentioned that yeah you're about it and here oh yeah oh gosh so here's Murdoch

1884
03:06:50.92 --> 03:06:56.52
talking about him he gets wounded yeah opposition was very light on the other side of the strip

1885
03:06:56.52 --> 03:07:00.52
and when we got down to the end of it we stopped and a Sherman tank came up to help us the tank

1886
03:07:00.52 --> 03:07:03.64
had a phone in the back and I was on the phone and I'm trying to tell the guy inside what

1887
03:07:03.64 --> 03:07:08.68
what I wanted him to shoot at the big smoke stack in the sugar cane factory I figured a

1888
03:07:08.68 --> 03:07:13.48
jab was up there spotting for artillery which was very accurate then all of a sudden boom

1889
03:07:13.48 --> 03:07:18.28
shell started falling all around the tank and I knew the spotter in the smoke stop was telling

1890
03:07:18.28 --> 03:07:23.72
his guns to fire at us so I ordered the tank commander get that smoke stack then I put the phone

1891
03:07:23.72 --> 03:07:27.96
back on and I'm running back to the safety in a hole and that's when I got hit by shrapnel in the

1892
03:07:27.96 --> 03:07:34.44
left leg in the right elbow so I'm sitting there and the corpsman comes over and starts bandaging

1893
03:07:34.44 --> 03:07:39.48
my arm and I look down and I'm down and my pants are all wet and I said holy shit I piss my

1894
03:07:39.48 --> 03:07:43.72
pants and the corpsman said that's not pissed that's blood that's my found out I'd been hitting

1895
03:07:43.72 --> 03:07:48.20
the leg so I dropped my pants and my drawers and now the corpsman's bandaging up my lead

1896
03:07:48.20 --> 03:07:52.92
leg and the jab start to shell us again so I jumped and ran to a nearby hole which wasn't

1897
03:07:52.92 --> 03:07:58.92
easy you know because my pants and my drawers were down around my ankles and so because I haven't

1898
03:07:58.92 --> 03:08:03.16
read the entire book you know you talk about Murdoch and I've mentioned that he was a character

1899
03:08:03.16 --> 03:08:07.64
and you know obviously you mentioned that he liked drink and one of the people he was in

1900
03:08:07.64 --> 03:08:12.60
alcoholic a lot of time he finally got over yeah well one of the people that I would say what's

1901
03:08:12.60 --> 03:08:17.24
that word aided him in being an alcoholic and somebody he apparently become a good friends with

1902
03:08:17.24 --> 03:08:23.16
because it was a Catholic was the Catholic priest father Jo Keehan so they were really good friends

1903
03:08:23.16 --> 03:08:32.12
and they spent a lot of time together and so as as he's starting to move towards being leaving the

1904
03:08:32.12 --> 03:08:38.92
area there's a guy John's executive John's exo Jim Westman appeared on the scene and told and

1905
03:08:38.92 --> 03:08:44.44
John told Westman to take over. He's a Westy congratulations you just made company commander I'm getting

1906
03:08:44.44 --> 03:08:50.44
out of here now Westman got hit by the same arterial that I almost got hit almost got

1907
03:08:50.44 --> 03:08:56.92
covered with and he he was out of the service after that he got badly wounded. Wow and we

1908
03:08:56.92 --> 03:09:07.56
got 50 casualties in Westman was one of I was so so this is Murdoch continuing how it goes from him

1909
03:09:07.56 --> 03:09:12.92
so I head down for the beach looking for the evacuation team I wasn't bleeding all that badly

1910
03:09:12.92 --> 03:09:17.96

03:09:33.16 --> 03:09:38.68
couldn't use it so solomon ticketed me a little while later I was evacuated in a small boat

1915
03:09:38.68 --> 03:09:44.68
and I said to the navy kid who is driving get hey find me a p.a. 51 will you and he said sure

1916
03:09:44.68 --> 03:09:49.96
we found the ship and by then I was lying down and the guys on the deck called down to me

1917
03:09:49.96 --> 03:09:55.96
will pick you up in a boom on a stretcher and I came up in the basket and I'm all dirty and

1918
03:09:55.96 --> 03:10:02.12
bloody and I see our chaplain father Jo Keehan who I'd become very friendly with so when they took

1919
03:10:02.12 --> 03:10:07.40
me out of the basket and put me on the stretcher on the deck I closed my eyes and attended I was dead

1920
03:10:08.60 --> 03:10:13.72
father Jo Keehan over and started giving me my last bite in the church last right of the church in

1921
03:10:13.72 --> 03:10:19.40
Latin but I can't keep a straight face so I opened my eyes and smiled at him and he goes you son of a

1922
03:10:19.40 --> 03:10:24.60
bitch he goes right from speaking lap Latin to calling me a son of a bitch then he took me down to the

1923
03:10:24.60 --> 03:10:28.68
infirmary and they patched me up a bit then he took me to his state room and put me in his bed I

1924
03:10:28.68 --> 03:10:33.72
must have slept all day and all night I didn't hear a thing I wasn't feeling any pain my night my

1925
03:10:33.72 --> 03:10:38.76
right hand and arm will numb when I came to I didn't know where I was at first then I took a shower

1926
03:10:38.76 --> 03:10:43.72
changed the bandages and got cleaned up that was the end of my war there my second day on side

1927
03:10:43.72 --> 03:10:49.08
pan my right arm was no good really my hand even today is no good yeah here's the thing even

1928
03:10:49.08 --> 03:10:53.08
after it's many quite a snoop there's this summer be done

1929
03:10:53.08 --> 03:10:59.40
it was a million dollar room I don't have any feeling the right side of my hand the nervous

1930
03:10:59.40 --> 03:11:03.32
cutters are million dollar room really because my thumb and two fingers are good still good

1931
03:11:03.32 --> 03:11:11.000
and the next the last finger the little finger we're dead so I thought that was about as good

1932
03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:21.88
of a story as I've ever heard oh character you know you know when he what happened to him there

1933
03:11:21.88 --> 03:11:29.64
when he walked barred into this hotel window and he was drunk as drunk as I'll get out of

1934
03:11:29.64 --> 03:11:35.08
course well anyway the retain commander talked to him then next day about it and he says you know

1935
03:11:35.08 --> 03:11:40.20
you should be more like an officer you shouldn't be doing that then he went on to say then

1936
03:11:40.20 --> 03:11:45.08
the retain commander says well why don't we'll mind and say so I'm kind of like that myself

1937
03:11:47.08 --> 03:11:51.24
you got a whole story about him in the whole one this same retain commander he was killed on

1938
03:11:51.24 --> 03:11:59.08
Bogumville as he landed they call them they called him well he he took over the one of the

1939
03:12:02.04 --> 03:12:07.96
what he called it one of the the Chinese way column yeah name right there in name form like the

1940
03:12:07.96 --> 03:12:17.24
equivalent of the of the in in England the equivalent of it and what I don't know I don't know

1941
03:12:17.24 --> 03:12:23.72
was an important you know that kind of like the like the uh recoluses but no no no no no no no no no no

1942
03:12:23.72 --> 03:12:30.36
there be unit that would be the ones that just like you a seal say a raider a raider he took over the

1943
03:12:30.36 --> 03:12:36.52
raider battalion that landed on Bogumville okay and he was killed there and then his his comments

1944
03:12:36.52 --> 03:12:49.96
were as he died so well it's been a short war for me well well you there's actually another another one

1945
03:12:49.96 --> 03:12:56.36
of these big situations that happens where there's a battle at sea oh yeah Philpincy yeah

1946
03:12:57.40 --> 03:13:03.40
and Maryana's turkey shoot yeah you know that it's coming you'd see this before and he said

1947
03:13:03.40 --> 03:13:07.24
we were right a few days later we learned that a great battle had indeed been fought in the waters off

1948
03:13:07.24 --> 03:13:12.12
west of siphon something in the decisive victory for the US yeah well yeah with their defeat in the

1949
03:13:12.12 --> 03:13:19.24
battle of the Philpincy the Japanese lost all hope of re-releaving their forces on siphon now was up to

1950
03:13:19.24 --> 03:13:25.08
us the marines knee army to win the land battle do we call do I call it the mariana's turkey shoot

1951
03:13:25.08 --> 03:13:29.88
yeah I did right there okay I don't think you've used those words well okay that's that's

1952
03:13:29.88 --> 03:13:35.96
traditionally what it's called yeah that is that's the same one now that's the reason that this guy

1953
03:13:37.88 --> 03:13:44.60
he held on because he thought the navy could come back and take it back now because he surrendered

1954
03:13:44.60 --> 03:13:53.24
even after the war he was not promoted to major in a terrible and and the other thing was even

1955
03:13:53.24 --> 03:14:00.60
the other other officer that I visited the same time that had fired at us from business artillery

1956
03:14:00.60 --> 03:14:07.96
in Guadalcanel named by name a tannihaki otannih he bad mouth is this guy says well he should have

1957
03:14:07.96 --> 03:14:16.52
even committed here he's even now he's a third side he's gonna be even he's still yeah oh yeah

1958
03:14:16.52 --> 03:14:26.84
now you guys are kind of pressing through the rest of the island you say here my mortar

1959
03:14:26.84 --> 03:14:30.68
section was always about 200 yards behind our lead elements and outbreak of small arms

1960
03:14:30.68 --> 03:14:36.44
firing front of us was a single stop and set up our weapons you see now in the in that

1961
03:14:37.32 --> 03:14:45.32
that movie about Pacific now you mean the the series the Pacific series yeah here here they had a

1962
03:14:45.32 --> 03:14:49.64
six-million meter per his right up in the front and I don't know why the advisor does hey you don't do

1963
03:14:49.64 --> 03:14:57.40
that yeah it doesn't make any sense and also all script is all screwed up it was all about a guy

1964
03:14:57.40 --> 03:15:03.72
that was going through a going through some kind of a psychological thing and hurry's talking he's talking

1965
03:15:03.72 --> 03:15:11.72
to the the kernel in charge of the of the of the of the hospital that he's at you know that

1966
03:15:11.72 --> 03:15:17.88
you're talking to the carman you know stuff like that yeah well Hollywood they don't always

1967
03:15:17.88 --> 03:15:23.40
terrible because you know they have to in the real world everything goes spread out so you

1968
03:15:23.40 --> 03:15:29.16
know that they take a picture so they they they take a picture some real concentrating you see

1969
03:15:29.16 --> 03:15:36.12
it's not like that at all yeah still one of my favorite uh war movies the Pacific yeah

1970
03:15:36.12 --> 03:15:43.08
what did you think of it well this this sets for incredible they were incredible I

1971
03:15:43.08 --> 03:15:50.52
I like friends this I I've been to Palo and good wonderful wonderful wonderful set yeah the

1972
03:15:52.04 --> 03:16:00.60
and let's see what was it there what was the other place they were they did Guadalcanale

1973
03:16:00.60 --> 03:16:06.28
so one Guadalcanale yeah well all the landings were they were great yeah they were great

1974
03:16:07.72 --> 03:16:12.28
was that one I was you know yeah that what I thought I did it cover each size those two

1975
03:16:14.52 --> 03:16:21.24
okay I'm thinking primarily I wanted Palo to like yes yeah yeah yeah I just the first time I ever

1976
03:16:21.24 --> 03:16:27.64
watched it I was riding on a airplane I had it on my computer I had a headphone's in I was watching

1977
03:16:27.64 --> 03:16:33.000
it really close and I I thought that the tone of the script is horrible oh the script might be

1978
03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:38.76
horrible out the combat scenes for me they were unbelievable unbelievable the any actually

1979
03:16:38.76 --> 03:16:42.76
we have your book I was I was saying while they did a great job because one thing that I

1980
03:16:42.76 --> 03:16:48.92
was said to myself you know it's you know when some of the fire fights the night fire fights

1981
03:16:48.92 --> 03:16:52.52
it's just flashes and they're like oh yeah that's what it's like there you go and you capture

1982
03:16:52.52 --> 03:16:57.64
it in your book you can't really tell what's going on but it's bad yeah and they did a great job

1983
03:16:57.64 --> 03:17:03.80
of capturing that hopefully this nail die who we'll pick up on this yeah you'll see the potential there

1984
03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
hopefully you will see

1985
03:17:13.48 --> 03:17:18.44
so now you guys are as you guys are pushing through you say casualties overall were relatively light

1986
03:17:18.44 --> 03:17:25.000
yes they were at that time well thing is you know this ran for almost a month so yeah I

1987
03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:31.48
just dragged out but the casualties were kept coming in of course yeah and then you say meanwhile

1988
03:17:31.48 --> 03:17:34.76
off to a right in the other side of the mountain the 27th Division had run into a meet grind

1989
03:17:34.76 --> 03:17:39.48
of these areas attacking on a plateau a plateau border on its left by a sheer cliff that formed

1990
03:17:39.48 --> 03:17:47.48
the east face of the mountain called purple herds yeah and they were held up and so

1991
03:17:48.76 --> 03:17:56.92
Alameda Smith he just he got rid of their their general and the army and National Guard troops

1992
03:17:56.92 --> 03:18:01.08
they they they they never really got over it that was unfair they shouldn't have done that

1993
03:18:01.08 --> 03:18:05.48
well I they did run if some terrible things down there were catching from the flank you know

1994
03:18:05.48 --> 03:18:11.64
true bad yeah and here I was up I was up way in and further and I could look down I see what they're up against

1995
03:18:14.12 --> 03:18:20.76
here speaking of friendly forces or friendly fire incidents here you were I was resting on one

1996
03:18:20.76 --> 03:18:25.56
knee next to a tree holding my carbine upright where you go up plate to the ground when suddenly

1997
03:18:25.56 --> 03:18:31.000
wham wham wham three big shells explode over a hundred to five millimeter long-term long-times

1998
03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:38.36
long range the shells cannot from Japanese artillery but from a battery of armored tanks didn't

1999
03:18:38.36 --> 03:18:44.28
believe that we were that far forward so he did it I found out like the western man told me about it

2000
03:18:45.24 --> 03:18:52.92
he's the one that called it in short he and it was horrible oh it was devastating oh my

2001
03:18:52.92 --> 03:18:56.92
guys so so many guys were just pulverized we didn't know what it hit us most of us did not hear the

2002
03:18:56.92 --> 03:19:01.08
shells coming no one's out of nowhere no one ducked for cover no one of the shells burst in the

2003
03:19:01.08 --> 03:19:05.72
tree above me deflecting the force of the blast and most of the strappin' outwards and set a

2004
03:19:05.72 --> 03:19:10.84
straight down that's my life a single piece of metal pierced my elbow the wound whose larger than

2005
03:19:10.84 --> 03:19:15.24
a bullet hole about an ancient dinammer at hurt like hell but it didn't look serious it hardly

2006
03:19:15.24 --> 03:19:21.80
blood and the bone didn't seem damaged it's still the wound needed treatment a few minutes later

2007
03:19:21.80 --> 03:19:26.76
several hospital jeeps converged on the scene and I talked over one of them on the way just 50 yards

2008
03:19:26.76 --> 03:19:30.84
from me I passed a large creator containing the remains of several men from weapons platoon who

2009
03:19:30.84 --> 03:19:35.16
been playing blackjack when the shell hit their position they'd little bit literally been blown

2010
03:19:35.16 --> 03:19:41.32
to bits several of those men had been my friends in Samoa I'd served in their unit before

2011
03:19:41.32 --> 03:19:47.08
being commissioned I could identify only one of them and because he was glasses yeah yeah

2012
03:19:47.88 --> 03:19:54.04
a few of the name was costinson a fact I have a picture of him too somewhere here

2013
03:19:54.04 --> 03:20:00.52
a few yards further on a dead marine lay in a hole beneath a coral outcropping where I had

2014
03:20:00.52 --> 03:20:06.60
spent the previous night he'd been killed by the army's misdirected salvo the same shell

2015
03:20:06.60 --> 03:20:11.88
the killer yeah you want yeah the same shell that killed the blackjack players wound a dick

2016
03:20:11.88 --> 03:20:16.36
stine then a member of weapons platoon he doesn't remember the explosion or anything else about

2017
03:20:16.36 --> 03:20:19.48
the day one moment I'm standing on the ground with the guys in the weapons platoon and the next

2018
03:20:19.48 --> 03:20:23.40
thing and I know I'm waking up in a tent there in the fuel hospital and it's around midnight

2019
03:20:23.40 --> 03:20:27.72
just a concussion in this case he just how long am I here so he just takes off

2020
03:20:31.40 --> 03:20:34.76
he's could still be alive I think he's he's in a rest of now I think

2021
03:20:36.36 --> 03:20:41.56
all in all the shells from the 150s fives killed or wounded more than 50 marines

2022
03:20:42.60 --> 03:20:49.96
yeah yeah yeah now the fellow wrote the wrote a book we came to win or we are be killed or

2023
03:20:49.96 --> 03:20:57.96
did die and he got hit he retired as a Colonel by the way and anyway he got hit by the same

2024
03:20:57.96 --> 03:21:04.36
same rounds and then put him out he got he got medical medical discipline uh retirement

2025
03:21:06.28 --> 03:21:12.20
devasting no no no no no that he had one of his pretty close to friends

2026
03:21:12.20 --> 03:21:18.12
turns out he was my company commander at at this particular time and uh the cell server they

2027
03:21:18.12 --> 03:21:25.16
was cell server he'd been a professional dancer and he got he got hit by by a large round

2028
03:21:25.56 --> 03:21:32.84
on on on on uh tenion and then I then I took over took over I was at exact took over and

2029
03:21:32.84 --> 03:21:39.24
he went he went to the hospital in Guadalcanal he killed himself because he did want to live

2030
03:21:39.24 --> 03:21:47.16
without a one leg because he's professional dancer and I know I don't think that this fellow wrote

2031
03:21:47.16 --> 03:21:52.12
the book realized he he he writes in the book he was the spun it he didn't rent he didn't never

2032
03:21:52.12 --> 03:21:56.60
mention he killed himself I talked to the guy that wrote the book he didn't really know one

2033
03:21:56.60 --> 03:22:03.48
yet others well he did I know what a coincidence I dated a gal one time she was a she was a

2034
03:22:05.16 --> 03:22:11.000
receptionist for William Morris agency and they they represent a lot of the big people

2035
03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:19.16
then it turned around all of those well anyway uh she uh I was invited to their Christmas party

2036
03:22:20.36 --> 03:22:27.32
and this was in 44 William Morris agency and as they came in she told me who was so on

2037
03:22:27.32 --> 03:22:34.44
money will be and so on is he all came in and then I ended up a day to do a couple of times and one time

2038
03:22:34.44 --> 03:22:40.76
uh we were in this uh this big place well no place can't think of name now but anyway

2039
03:22:41.48 --> 03:22:47.72
others had just returned it's about a month after I had from from Memorionis and I said how did

2040
03:22:47.72 --> 03:22:54.92
he how did son son make out and they said oh you didn't know he killed himself my girlfriend

2041
03:22:55.48 --> 03:23:00.52
says I knew that we were close fans of his family we used to play brist together

2042
03:23:00.52 --> 03:23:12.92
and a small world that's crazy yeah that's crazy yeah so at this point you're wounded yeah yeah

2043
03:23:12.92 --> 03:23:19.000
and you go back to the aid station yeah and then late on the 7th of July my 3rd day in the

2044
03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:23.80
field hospital doctors and corpsman went through the words towards telling all the walking

2045
03:23:23.80 --> 03:23:29.64
to remember to the units because we had to lock up and they were about to the Japanese

2046
03:23:29.64 --> 03:23:36.60
and the guns I had to have a still thousands of their hiding ready ready to kill themselves

2047
03:23:36.60 --> 03:23:45.72
or make one last bunch of charge and her I had walked right through her 40 were killed

2048
03:23:45.72 --> 03:23:51.56
that that that the last night of the mop up can you imagine and then this guy

2049
03:23:51.56 --> 03:24:01.32
he was in these were his men and when I I found out his track his track and my track

2050
03:24:02.04 --> 03:24:07.88
crossed okay I found out on that and so when I once stood I wanted to talk to him sure enough

2051
03:24:07.88 --> 03:24:12.76
she's yeah I was there some reason I wasn't saying bonds on all that no that was another guy

2052
03:24:14.52 --> 03:24:19.24
so here and then then he and then then the guy wrote a book about him I have the copy of the book

2053
03:24:19.24 --> 03:24:26.92
it's called the last the last samurai by by Jones and I helped I helped the reviewer of the book

2054
03:24:26.92 --> 03:24:40.92
before he published it well so uh ended up uh he was invited by the author to attend our reunion in Florida

2055
03:24:42.12 --> 03:24:48.04
and when he came he and his wife came and some of our guys treated him materially they could not

2056
03:24:48.04 --> 03:24:54.28
believe this guy could have done what he did as far as given him such a bad time being up there

2057
03:24:54.28 --> 03:24:58.76
right up until after the war and I tried to I tried to call things down and I had to hit

2058
03:24:58.76 --> 03:25:02.60
the time there's an article there's an article look at this article I hear tell the about it

2059
03:25:02.60 --> 03:25:11.08
look at this article think I have it in here I think no I guess I don't have it here I never think

2060
03:25:11.08 --> 03:25:22.52
yeah here's article I know oh I guess I don't have the way man no that's not yet he's a darn it

2061
03:25:24.12 --> 03:25:27.96
by the way here's a picture this guy I showed you that there's a picture this guy that I'm

2062
03:25:28.52 --> 03:25:33.88
interviewing this is the other guy that fired his known as pistol peat he's one that did

2063
03:25:33.88 --> 03:25:43.32
most of the shooting at us at 105 long range rifle yeah for him and two and one was on

2064
03:25:43.32 --> 03:25:50.28
Guadalcanale we we went to it that's I have a picture in my book with him standing at it and

2065
03:25:50.28 --> 03:26:01.08
he became a major his his father had been a general in at a kind of like our like west point

2066
03:26:01.08 --> 03:26:08.68
but for senior officers to come to and one of these officers was the prince he was a

2067
03:26:08.68 --> 03:26:14.84
tenant general became a lieutenant general and he was one of the one standing on a Missouri

2068
03:26:14.84 --> 03:26:22.76
at this room that was the one of his students his father's students amazing huh yeah

2069
03:26:23.40 --> 03:26:28.92
and by the way this is what the bonds are look like here you see that here we're we buried those bodies

2070
03:26:28.92 --> 03:26:33.32
we dragged them into the ditch and we buried probably 4,000 bodies like that

2071
03:26:34.92 --> 03:26:40.60
well and now they're homes all through here yeah for so they're still there they're still

2072
03:26:40.60 --> 03:26:47.24
they're only about four feet down and then then there's then there's a beautiful new hotels right

2073
03:26:47.24 --> 03:26:52.52
on the beach just across the road from that and you were probably told about that when you were

2074
03:26:52.52 --> 03:26:58.12
there I don't know it's a place called place called tannipay I don't know tannipay and also

2075
03:26:58.12 --> 03:27:05.40
place called sandrokey yeah so for people that are just listening these are just images of

2076
03:27:05.40 --> 03:27:13.16
this this massive attack it happened was we we fired in our live in three is our tour

2077
03:27:13.16 --> 03:27:21.08
we fired in at them as they were charging and so their bodies are all chuda all chuda

2078
03:27:21.88 --> 03:27:26.52
you go into some pretty good detail about the about that bonds I had to talk about this

2079
03:27:26.52 --> 03:27:32.12
about the age band and radio that is a best you'll find anywhere and in fact

2080
03:27:33.24 --> 03:27:38.76
that's where you know I had to reveal it in detail because I had some doubt about it and I said

2081
03:27:38.76 --> 03:27:43.80
well it looks like in general he's okay he's he's said it right there's nobody else can talk about

2082
03:27:43.80 --> 03:27:49.08
it's in that detail don't but he can then oh it's a great idea oh first hand yeah

2083
03:27:49.08 --> 03:27:57.40
now I did go to a reunion of those people in that battalion back in Iowa and so this guy was

2084
03:27:57.40 --> 03:28:04.36
there and he was one of the ones that the interview of course for this yeah and then yeah so

2085
03:28:04.36 --> 03:28:11.40
if you want to do some account of just incredible fortitude you got to read this book and

2086
03:28:11.40 --> 03:28:18.84
then it picks up where you what you were just talking about this is when you go now to do sort of the

2087
03:28:20.52 --> 03:28:26.52
sort of a cleanup and you see this many of the bodies were recognizable yeah and

2088
03:28:29.24 --> 03:28:34.04
one of the guys Sandy and the others had to reach the bloody remains for dog tags that would

2089
03:28:34.04 --> 03:28:39.32
identify their friends discovering which one of their friends they were charging and hunger

2090
03:28:39.32 --> 03:28:45.48
if I own people were killed most of them soldiers they went right through them you say that this

2091
03:28:45.48 --> 03:28:51.40
bonsai this bonsai resulted in as near as I can determine from what I saw and what I've read

2092
03:28:51.40 --> 03:28:57.72
the Japanese lost upward of 4,000 men some 500 Americans were killed most of them from the army

2093
03:28:57.72 --> 03:29:02.60
the two battalions that were overrun and nearly wiped out each battery suffered 150 two

2094
03:29:02.60 --> 03:29:07.64
casualties in the attack 75 killed or 6 wounded they got completely your run

2095
03:29:07.64 --> 03:29:12.28
it's estimated that some 600 Japanese were killed on the open ground directly in front of the

2096
03:29:12.28 --> 03:29:23.80
batteries guns yeah yeah man you're you were pushing up again this is another another thing

2097
03:29:23.80 --> 03:29:27.24
that you passed through we passed through their positions and deployed to skirmish lines

2098
03:29:27.24 --> 03:29:31.32
extending the water's edge in the railroad tracks of 6 buildings advancing along the

2099
03:29:32.52 --> 03:29:37.48
along the shore in the eighth of longer road yeah thus a raid we picked our way

2100
03:29:37.48 --> 03:29:42.28
slowly through the battle zone our weapons at the ready all around the dead were thick on the

2101
03:29:42.28 --> 03:29:47.48
ground in numbers that defied comprehension bodies and pieces of bodies everywhere artillery

2102
03:29:47.48 --> 03:29:52.04
and pounded the area and chopped up the bodies turning the battlefield into an immense open air

2103
03:29:52.04 --> 03:29:58.04
abitwar strewn with torsos and limbs and heads and chunks of unadunifiable flesh burned black

2104
03:29:58.04 --> 03:30:03.64
by fire I could recreate the flow I could recreate the flow and ferocity the battle the

2105
03:30:03.64 --> 03:30:08.20
patterns of the fight and flight by the numbers and positioning of the dead there would be places

2106
03:30:08.20 --> 03:30:12.76
pockets of resistance where bodies were pile on top of bodies dead Japanese entangled with

2107
03:30:12.76 --> 03:30:18.04
that americans frozen in attitudes of hand to hand combat clutching each other plunging

2108
03:30:18.04 --> 03:30:22.76
bay nets into each other locked in their death struggles arm machine gun positions were

2109
03:30:22.76 --> 03:30:27.32
tabloids of butchery with bodies of the Japanese heaped in front of positions and bodies of

2110
03:30:27.32 --> 03:30:32.92
american soldiers slumped over their guns for men who didn't want to be there the US army soldiers

2111
03:30:32.92 --> 03:30:38.04
they were a lot of drafts and all of a bunch of drafts here too yeah not all the Japanese were

2112
03:30:38.04 --> 03:30:43.88
dead of course as usual some were shaming yeah we knew this would be the case and we very quickly

2113
03:30:43.88 --> 03:30:47.48
and we're very quick on our triggers if we saw any movement if one of those bodies so much

2114
03:30:47.48 --> 03:30:52.28
is twitch we poor fire we'd poor fire into it even if we didn't see movement if a body or group

2115
03:30:52.28 --> 03:30:57.08
of bodies looks suspicious we shot it through and through bushes big enough to provide concealment

2116
03:30:57.08 --> 03:31:03.48
were preemptively blasted into wood chips and leaf bits now and then as we advance across the

2117
03:31:03.48 --> 03:31:08.76
battlefield the dead body rose suddenly to throw a grenade or shoot it us some Japanese jumped

2118
03:31:08.76 --> 03:31:14.04
to their feet and tried to run away we shot them all just shot them all right down no prisoners

2119
03:31:14.04 --> 03:31:19.40
were taken we moved forward at a steady pace hardly breaking a stride rarely halting we just kept

2120
03:31:19.40 --> 03:31:24.68
walking through the killing ground looking around scrutinizing the bodies firing at the Japanese

2121
03:31:24.68 --> 03:31:30.04
are coming to a probably under dead probably at least a hundred and we we we we had only

2122
03:31:30.04 --> 03:31:41.000
a couple of wounded as well we had that process yeah that was a large of stuff the war

2123
03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:47.88
that was what that was a large of sponsi counter attack of the war see if they were given

2124
03:31:47.88 --> 03:31:53.40
no objective to just keep going keep going it gives many of us as possible until they're

2125
03:31:53.40 --> 03:31:59.24
in the end of the house lost their life and and the two two commanders they they

2126
03:31:59.24 --> 03:32:04.52
committed very carry before started and one was the one the gumo was the one the lead to attack

2127
03:32:04.52 --> 03:32:16.12
on Pearl Harbor now gumo and then we finally get to the last campaign a little a little

2128
03:32:16.12 --> 03:32:23.24
over three miles south of siphon sent tinian twelve miles long six miles across it's widest point

2129
03:32:23.48 --> 03:32:28.12
and this was your oh this is really something too that first night

2130
03:32:34.68 --> 03:32:40.60
one eight landed late that afternoon yeah the second division unit involved the only the only

2131
03:32:40.60 --> 03:32:44.76
second division unit involved the jday operations the regiment quickly established a reserve

2132
03:32:44.76 --> 03:32:48.92
position behind the beach has perimeter digging in and string barbed wire and anticipation

2133
03:32:48.92 --> 03:32:54.44
of enemy counter attack all moving around the perimeter. All of it's 200 miles 200 to 100 foot

2134
03:32:54.44 --> 03:33:00.28
to 200 yards wide beach they had no idea they were going to be up there they thought we

2135
03:33:00.28 --> 03:33:05.56
got land down down there the main town which was called a well-known called san Jose

2136
03:33:05.56 --> 03:33:10.28
you guys fainted you could there's a fake we did a fake but we had a battle shed hip hit

2137
03:33:10.28 --> 03:33:15.56
it was a lot of damage and lost lies from counter counter fire counter battery fire.

2138
03:33:15.56 --> 03:33:20.92
This was for me and many other second division marines the fourth combat operation in just 18

2139
03:33:20.92 --> 03:33:26.52
months the three previous guadal canal tarua and siphon had all been difficult each in its own way

2140
03:33:26.52 --> 03:33:31.24
taking enormous physical and emotional toll on all the survivors most of us have been wounded at

2141
03:33:31.24 --> 03:33:38.52
least once all of us have been sick. Now somewhere we're you're going to get to the point where

2142
03:33:38.52 --> 03:33:46.84
we had to at night go over and head off the Japanese that we're attacking our artillery and

2143
03:33:46.84 --> 03:33:53.64
they're we're you know you don't know and I'll tell you about it if you don't see yeah yeah

2144
03:33:53.64 --> 03:34:00.76
the thing that's interesting about this is I mean just you guys having been through

2145
03:34:00.76 --> 03:34:05.80
everything that you'd been through at this point I mean the mentality going into this you know

2146
03:34:05.80 --> 03:34:09.40
you say here the air force could have dropped bushels of purple hearts on our front line units

2147
03:34:09.40 --> 03:34:12.92
and every marine who grabbed on what had deserved it. Okay now they're talking the

2148
03:34:13.64 --> 03:34:18.76
napal was dropped the first time to war on on tinian probably before we landed.

2149
03:34:20.76 --> 03:34:24.68
Yeah you said you said then the aircraft used napal bombs something you do us we

2150
03:34:24.68 --> 03:34:29.000
watching amazement as the bombs fell earth were tumbling and over and an exploded on a ridge

2151
03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:34.20
that instantly erupted in flames and oily smoke along its entire length about 10 seconds later

2152
03:34:34.20 --> 03:34:39.64
gust of hot air from the ledge blew us over. Next day first batiny elements moved up on the

2153
03:34:39.64 --> 03:34:44.44
ridge and poked around the scorched landscape most of the undergrowth had been burned away.

2154
03:34:44.44 --> 03:34:48.84
The ground was black and reaped of gasoline and the foxholes were filled with the corpses of

2155
03:34:48.84 --> 03:34:55.64
Japanese soldiers blackened and shriveled by the incinerating fires. Yeah first use in napal?

2156
03:34:57.88 --> 03:35:01.88
What was the other section that you were talking about? Okay right I'll tell you in the

2157
03:35:01.88 --> 03:35:12.60
day the island of secure. August 2nd here I'm a company commander. We reached the next the last

2158
03:35:12.60 --> 03:35:18.52
bit the beach you know looking down over the cliff and when that one we returned there when

2159
03:35:18.52 --> 03:35:26.20
they're in March of this year we looked from the south side of that beach where the civilians

2160
03:35:26.20 --> 03:35:34.92
all jumped and killed themselves and looked up across and my company was spread from about halfway

2161
03:35:34.92 --> 03:35:42.92
up to clear to that point and we had we had we had both go out with a bullhorn to form the surrender

2162
03:35:42.92 --> 03:35:47.24
and gave them all the made of they didn't so then we fired them machine guns and martyrs at them

2163
03:35:47.24 --> 03:35:54.76
and they all jumped off off the point this side of it and hunters jumped off their des.

2164
03:35:54.76 --> 03:36:02.28
And then that night we were spread out so long so so thinly we decided I'll talk to my

2165
03:36:03.48 --> 03:36:08.12
my company exactly that time and what's we do at long and so you're just going to have to have

2166
03:36:08.12 --> 03:36:12.60
strong points figure where they're likely to come through. So we did and we looked out they tried to

2167
03:36:12.60 --> 03:36:23.000
come through right a strong point so we'll let but anyway these the then we had to send people down

2168
03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:27.24
and try to get them out of the caves down below us there are a lot of civilians in there.

2169
03:36:29.08 --> 03:36:32.20
So were the civilians out where they were they staying with the with the with the with the

2170
03:36:32.20 --> 03:36:36.76
no they're by themselves families. Yeah the were families one not to run there they're

2171
03:36:36.76 --> 03:36:43.000
even the same cave some soldiers were them yeah yeah and eventually you could say here the

2172
03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:50.84
Japanese I mean and again this we're jumping through all kinds of you know just crazy combat

2173
03:36:50.84 --> 03:36:56.60
and then you get to a point where the Japanese had no no more fight left of them they were ready to die

2174
03:36:57.16 --> 03:37:01.08
if not yet call it quits for the most part they went on. Okay then what happened you see when

2175
03:37:01.08 --> 03:37:06.84
I when I told you right after we landed the first night and here we got here we got we got

2176
03:37:06.84 --> 03:37:14.36
we got got a message that our artillery was being being overrun by our other Japanese and so we

2177
03:37:14.36 --> 03:37:20.92
had here's that for dark and probably around midnight and here we here as a tiny I was a

2178
03:37:20.92 --> 03:37:29.88
company exact and I took up 200 or maybe two Patoons and we went single file to former sliders

2179
03:37:29.88 --> 03:37:35.72
from the front of the artillery well that's great dangers because anybody walking around is

2180
03:37:35.72 --> 03:37:41.80
going to get going to get the enemy you know right well then I went when morning came here there were

2181
03:37:41.80 --> 03:37:48.04
all kinds of shovels out there and there was Japanese and here we had the our line of scrimmers

2182
03:37:48.04 --> 03:37:53.80
had to go forward oh this is going to be horrible the air in fox though they're in holes and we're

2183
03:37:53.80 --> 03:38:02.04
not not a lawnmower shot at us as we came up very close with an less than 100 feet or so I

2184
03:38:02.04 --> 03:38:08.92
just put a hand grenade shoot kill themselves bang bang 100 and kill themselves as we walk forward

2185
03:38:08.92 --> 03:38:14.68
and we only had a couple of men wounded so we had and why they didn't shoot back I don't understand

2186
03:38:15.40 --> 03:38:21.72
we're in all of them were given orders not to thank you in the air hurry wow

2187
03:38:22.92 --> 03:38:29.64
what a relief what a relief so going back to the book here and again I'm jumping through

2188
03:38:29.64 --> 03:38:36.04
some incredible stories but Tinian was declared secure on one August first Patan pulled back

2189
03:38:36.04 --> 03:38:41.48
about a mile from the coast and set up camp the end of the fighting was very abrupt suddenly we didn't

2190
03:38:41.48 --> 03:38:46.60
have anything to do there was no enemy activity in the immediate area no danger no shooting I just

2191
03:38:46.60 --> 03:38:51.88
sat back and tried to enjoy the situation that this wasn't as easy as you might think I was exhausted

2192
03:38:51.88 --> 03:38:57.40
and filled with a lingering dread a sense that I'd used up all my lives I had I had been

2193
03:38:57.40 --> 03:39:01.32
become conditioned to wondering whether I was going to survive another day and then all of a sudden

2194
03:39:01.32 --> 03:39:07.000
all the causes for concern had vanished as though I had been given a reprieve from a death sentence

2195
03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:11.96
I could hardly believe it a strange feeling I didn't have long to dwell on it a few days later

2196
03:39:11.96 --> 03:39:18.92
I received orders to return to the states 32 months after leaving San Diego I was going home

2197
03:39:21.48 --> 03:39:26.44
three weeks later at Pearl Harbor where I'd been marking time in the transit center I'd

2198
03:39:26.44 --> 03:39:32.36
boarded a giant Martin Mars flying boat for the final leg of the flight that was oh my gosh

2199
03:39:33.56 --> 03:39:39.96
well landed in Patan when he called that place I can't think we're now in Berkeley

2200
03:39:39.96 --> 03:39:44.12
what is it like? Alameda Alameda Alameda Alameda Naval Air Station

2201
03:39:44.12 --> 03:39:48.28
everyone on board service men from every branch returning home watching outer silence as the golden

2202
03:39:48.28 --> 03:39:55.32
gate bridge passed beneath I reported to a marine facility was granted 32 day furlough one for every month of

2203
03:39:55.32 --> 03:40:01.000
overseas duty later that day I visited a barber shop while I was sitting in the chair one of the

2204
03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:05.72
patrons began bitching about the terrible state of things in the country I listened to him for a while

2205
03:40:05.72 --> 03:40:10.68
and then I exploded you don't know what terrible is I told him he shut up after that

2206
03:40:11.48 --> 03:40:15.64
you know talk about the woman ran to the what the woman ran into oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

2207
03:40:15.64 --> 03:40:20.84
yes the best I picked up that was your first time in the female marine yeah yeah and you know

2208
03:40:20.84 --> 03:40:28.04
because they brought the women in now they could form a six division but taking all them in

2209
03:40:28.04 --> 03:40:35.72
they had clerical type of work take them out put them in combat right this is the thing that's crazy

2210
03:40:35.72 --> 03:40:39.88
for me to think about here is you know you just have one line it says the war wasn't over right

2211
03:40:40.52 --> 03:40:46.36
and this is 1944 the war wasn't over and as you talked about earlier the thought was that

2212
03:40:46.36 --> 03:40:53.48
you know America was gonna have to invade every island until you got right into Tokyo and since you

2213
03:40:53.48 --> 03:41:00.20
had seen the the how how steadfast the Japanese were you all just thought yeah I might be home for

2214
03:41:00.20 --> 03:41:05.000
year but I'll be back over there as a as a battalion executive officer and a battalion officer or

2215
03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:09.88
whatever you know all my friends that came back and they they ended back up

2216
03:41:09.88 --> 03:41:17.32
keeping preparing preparing for that so about a year you spend at Kwanico at the basics school

2217
03:41:17.32 --> 03:41:22.36
teaching the young marine that and and the first what called PCS tuned commander school

2218
03:41:22.84 --> 03:41:27.56
I went through the first as a captain and then I went through orientation crashed

2219
03:41:27.56 --> 03:41:31.16
because I became an instructor you see okay so they sent you through a school

2220
03:41:31.16 --> 03:41:35.80
they sent you to a commander even though you'd already been a company commander in combat yeah yeah yeah

2221
03:41:35.80 --> 03:41:42.44
so anyway I don't know the academics of it basically and well and then now it's a

2222
03:41:42.44 --> 03:41:48.76
commander then the next I'm a commander the at the basic school and here I have a

2223
03:41:48.76 --> 03:41:56.44
battalion of a second of tennis just recent graduates in naval academy and a battalion senior

2224
03:41:56.44 --> 03:42:03.08
NCOs and none of them wanted to continue they just wanted to retire at their rank you know

2225
03:42:03.08 --> 03:42:09.64
you're going to be back to a second lieutenant and I never forget when the first things I had to do

2226
03:42:09.64 --> 03:42:16.68
was keep my little extra on formal guard mouth and I never been the formal guard and I told them

2227
03:42:16.68 --> 03:42:22.44
I told these guys I said I never I've been a combat almost as time and I've been a formal guard mouth

2228
03:42:22.44 --> 03:42:28.36
since I I had a felt presentation to move it felled around you know they didn't give me a bad

2229
03:42:28.36 --> 03:42:33.40
time they'd all they'd all been through it you know but I never never had been through it you know

2230
03:42:33.40 --> 03:42:38.20
and I told them major about it and said he told me said you figured out you figured out

2231
03:42:40.20 --> 03:42:41.64
no

2232
03:42:42.68 --> 03:42:47.56
here we go on August 15th after night of devastating bonding raids bombing raids on eight

2233
03:42:47.56 --> 03:42:50.92
Japanese cities the Japanese announced their intention for surrender yeah

2234
03:42:50.92 --> 03:42:54.68
for Americans and most of the and this is after obviously the bomb yeah you know

2235
03:42:54.68 --> 03:43:00.36
um for Americans and the rest of the world the announcement signaled the end of World War two

2236
03:43:00.36 --> 03:43:04.44
even though the formal surrender didn't take place until the second second of September

2237
03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:09.96
a few weeks later our classes were terminated in orders were cut by thousands to release

2238
03:43:09.96 --> 03:43:14.68
men from active duty I was asked whether I wanted to stay on and take a regular commission in

2239
03:43:14.68 --> 03:43:19.08
the Marine Corps I was tempted I'd started as a private made it all the way up to Captain at age

2240
03:43:19.08 --> 03:43:24.36
24 no small achievement and then was the potential for further advancement in the postwar corps

2241
03:43:24.36 --> 03:43:30.12
at first I said yes and signed my the requisite papers but after sleeping on I changed my mind

2242
03:43:30.12 --> 03:43:33.96
the next day I would do my papers shortly thereafter I was released from active duty

2243
03:43:33.96 --> 03:43:39.80
I bought a 1940 crisis or convertible yeah and an octobre hydrovocross country to spook a

2244
03:43:39.80 --> 03:43:46.84
yeah yeah five day journey yeah and then then I went to work at the H1th of college

2245
03:43:47.40 --> 03:43:52.68
I went to work for North American aviation and there was there for six years

2246
03:43:52.68 --> 03:44:02.04
and then lucky there was there for 23 years and I was on primarily on the exploration space you

2247
03:44:02.04 --> 03:44:07.40
know I was involved with the first the first flights to Mars and the first fly by

2248
03:44:08.04 --> 03:44:15.24
it was a failure we provided the vehicle that did the injection took it to it and it was going to

2249
03:44:15.24 --> 03:44:21.32
as it flow by and then take pictures of it's blue by and also provided the shroud that protected it

2250
03:44:21.32 --> 03:44:28.04
get now the atmosphere well the shroud outcast and blew up and here I had to take a technician

2251
03:44:28.04 --> 03:44:34.36
down to JPL who would provide the spacecraft and and then then that had to take down a half was

2252
03:44:34.36 --> 03:44:41.32
shroud and they put it in temperature out of two chamber it did blow up and I had to go back and tell

2253
03:44:41.32 --> 03:44:48.52
our engineering people hey it did blow up and this all no it couldn't there's just they just

2254
03:44:48.52 --> 03:44:55.000
convinced you did no it did blow up so then we had to work like the next the next launch

2255
03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:59.80
next launch window was just matter a couple months later so we built a different kind of

2256
03:44:59.80 --> 03:45:05.24
different construction and it made it from then on I was involved and all kinds of involved

2257
03:45:05.24 --> 03:45:11.88
with with the with the tech pictures of the moon where they uh Boeing provided space

2258
03:45:11.88 --> 03:45:16.52
to get we provided the means of getting there and then astronauts when they prepared to land

2259
03:45:16.52 --> 03:45:23.56
the moon will they their practice meeting with our spacecraft that kind of stuff yeah and one time

2260
03:45:23.56 --> 03:45:29.000
one time and then I became the I became the president of the management association about 3000

2261
03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:39.72
members and one time we had we had uh put this name uh the first on the moon um Armstrong Neil Armstrong

2262
03:45:39.72 --> 03:45:44.60
he spoke to us and I asked him a question we had about seven hundred people in our tennis

2263
03:45:44.60 --> 03:45:49.16
and he asked him a question and says sometimes you look up there at nighttime and he has to kind

2264
03:45:49.16 --> 03:45:54.20
of pinch yourself I was really there can you imagine can you imagine what his answer was

2265
03:45:54.20 --> 03:45:56.84
I have no idea his answer was I've learned to live with it

2266
03:46:00.04 --> 03:46:05.72
and just brought down the house oh she and then what you when did you get married when you have kids

2267
03:46:05.72 --> 03:46:27.08
uh that was in uh just a minute 40 47 yeah and uh I mean this this book is just like I said

2268
03:46:27.08 --> 03:46:33.48
I've read a fraction of it probably read less than 10% of it tonight the the amount of

2269
03:46:33.48 --> 03:46:38.92
information the amount of detail the stories are just okay now this is unbelievable this is

2270
03:46:38.92 --> 03:46:44.04
when you get that one and it's entirely different this is based on interviews by a very

2271
03:46:44.04 --> 03:46:51.000
and this is based on some talking to people but mostly I'm talking to the natives I'm talking

2272
03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:58.12
to Japanese uh I'm describing what what it's like now what the landscape is like all in the

2273
03:46:58.12 --> 03:47:03.000
pre-lying around so it's almost like this book should have been written first and should have been written second

2274
03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:07.88
well I don't know you see see the thing is this is too broad or is this is getting

2275
03:47:07.88 --> 03:47:13.80
not detailed and detailed with the people yeah and that's mentioned in in the in the

2276
03:47:13.80 --> 03:47:17.64
in the prologue or the forward in the forward in the forward that's where it's mentioned that's

2277
03:47:17.64 --> 03:47:23.72
reason it's a different entirely different and I didn't even tend to write this but uh you got

2278
03:47:23.72 --> 03:47:29.16
you know here hit all of these all these tapes and now only that and a little little little

2279
03:47:29.16 --> 03:47:33.80
tape recorder and the one's Japanese are in two acute and he was doing the same thing so

2280
03:47:33.80 --> 03:47:39.48
anything I said he was recording or I'm saying so on and so that's when it said okay that was

2281
03:47:39.48 --> 03:47:47.16
82 then 85 183 a tickle group out as a tour guide then 85 I went I went to japan went on

2282
03:47:47.16 --> 03:47:54.92
space A and so here I entered you and that was that was really interesting I'll tell you this guy

2283
03:47:54.92 --> 03:48:00.84
this guy Tani he told me all or the space we've had yassikuni shrine and the you know the

2284
03:48:01.64 --> 03:48:08.76
in person if he had less than all that kind of stuff and just a lot and then went into a

2285
03:48:08.76 --> 03:48:14.28
a TV studio and all that kind of stuff is incredible and any any point or doubt you know

2286
03:48:14.28 --> 03:48:21.40
I think it was so fire bomb you know it all this is all new all new but then everyone is so friendly

2287
03:48:21.40 --> 03:48:27.32
to me you know just couldn't believe it yeah then he built he built a he built a you know a battleship

2288
03:48:28.60 --> 03:48:36.28
that was the Japanese battleship that had it's shilled Guadalcanale he made it and it would

2289
03:48:36.28 --> 03:48:43.24
it was radio controlled and it would fly even it would fire from the guns with a photo flash flash out

2290
03:48:43.96 --> 03:48:50.36
and he had in his garage and his eight foot long is the same size is the actual drawings of the

2291
03:48:51.40 --> 03:49:00.52
of the battleship so he made it the same size okay and now he he came down with cancer

2292
03:49:00.52 --> 03:49:07.88
and we we of course one with a 15 years and so then he wanted to hear he had the same what should

2293
03:49:07.88 --> 03:49:13.40
I do it said well you know there's there's the museum back in Kalamazoo

2294
03:49:14.44 --> 03:49:20.04
Guadalcanale battles and he did he sent it back there and send a museum now

2295
03:49:20.04 --> 03:49:24.28
oh wow yeah I have a picture of him in my book here summer

2296
03:49:24.28 --> 03:49:30.92
well and then here have a lot of that a lot of little cartoons he drew I'd say what happened here

2297
03:49:31.72 --> 03:49:37.08
and so he drew out he drew it out this is this is what happened or he'd send me something about here

2298
03:49:38.28 --> 03:49:44.44
here he is just starving there and now here he's dreaming of a meal that later on he will

2299
03:49:44.44 --> 03:49:52.04
had stuff like that it's just incredible well this stuff is is amazing these these this

2300
03:49:52.04 --> 03:49:56.92
book is like I said this book is awesome thanks to my co-author he know he know how to craft it

2301
03:49:56.92 --> 03:50:02.04
all I did was hey yeah this is correct yeah yeah oh well there's more of this there's a little

2302
03:50:02.04 --> 03:50:08.28
more here and there's not the main the main was on site pan I just I had some doubts because

2303
03:50:09.16 --> 03:50:14.28
he had he did believe in some conspiracy theories about other things that's reason I was concerned

2304
03:50:14.28 --> 03:50:20.52
but overall it was okay it was good well it's like I said it's an incredible book to read I

2305
03:50:20.52 --> 03:50:26.28
know I've had you here for just about four hours talking but I wanted to I wanted to kind of close

2306
03:50:26.28 --> 03:50:30.60
it out with one last thing one last section of the book and you already kind of mentioned it a

2307
03:50:30.60 --> 03:50:36.52
little bit but the way it's written is just just such a fitting close to this is not the guy

2308
03:50:36.52 --> 03:50:45.32
that's the life yeah and so it says this on October on on 22 November 1993 the 50th anniversary

2309
03:50:45.32 --> 03:50:51.72
of the bout for Taroa I tended this ceremony in yorkers New York to be dedicate here you go

2310
03:50:51.72 --> 03:50:57.88
Anthony O'Boyle Memorial Park in the name of the fallen private from my pontoon he was well known

2311
03:50:57.88 --> 03:51:03.96
there in that town also attending where Anthony's good friends and foxhole buddies yeah

2312
03:51:03.96 --> 03:51:10.92
Bill Crumpacker said it right yeah he was with a dickstein yeah our company commander John Merck

2313
03:51:10.92 --> 03:51:18.04
and several other Taroa vet as well as a member as a number of high-ranking Marines

2314
03:51:18.04 --> 03:51:23.56
including Lieutenant John General John J. She hand he bought a herd of a man Jeff yeah

2315
03:51:23.56 --> 03:51:29.64
then a member of the joint chiefs of staff yeah it was a cold gray day with an icy wind blowing

2316
03:51:29.64 --> 03:51:34.36
off the Hudson River yeah quite a contrast to the tropical heat and brilliant sunlight on

2317
03:51:34.36 --> 03:51:40.68
Bezier when Anthony had medicine and yeah shot in the head while peering over the sea wall

2318
03:51:40.68 --> 03:51:46.68
and red beach too Anthony had fallen back into John Murdoch's arms still alive but unconscious

2319
03:51:46.68 --> 03:51:53.88
his body twitching his eyes open but empty John held him for a brief time spoke to him

2320
03:51:53.88 --> 03:51:59.000
and then set him aside on the beach among the bodies of other slain Marines where he died a

2321
03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:06.68
few minutes later all the solemn knees appropriate to the occasion where observed all the

2322
03:52:06.68 --> 03:52:15.24
rights were performed the colors were trouped speeches were giving music was played prayers were offered

2323
03:52:16.60 --> 03:52:23.48
we saying the national anthem the Marine him and amazing grace there was a presentation of

2324
03:52:23.48 --> 03:52:30.20
military testimonials proclamations were made John Murdoch gave a talk about Anthony

2325
03:52:30.92 --> 03:52:36.28
then presented Anthony's brother with the purple heart a fitting gesture from a man who comforted

2326
03:52:36.28 --> 03:52:42.84
Anthony in his final moments of his life and honor guard fired at 21 gun salute

2327
03:52:43.88 --> 03:52:51.16
taps was played we all wept our tears were shed in both sorrow and joy

2328
03:52:51.16 --> 03:52:59.64
there was cause for both Anthony's life had been short his dying heart his glory

2329
03:53:00.52 --> 03:53:10.68
everlasting there was no bitterness no disillusionment no anger his life had mattered

2330
03:53:10.68 --> 03:53:22.20
his death also and we remembered both and knew that both had meaning and purpose the biographical

2331
03:53:22.20 --> 03:53:26.52
sketch in the program for the ceremony expressed the feelings well in this regard

2332
03:53:27.40 --> 03:53:33.56
and serves as a fitting epitaph for every marine in the second world war

2333
03:53:33.56 --> 03:53:41.80
and here's what it read if the world had been different if he had been born at another time

2334
03:53:44.20 --> 03:53:51.24
Anthony with his sunshine smile could have married raised a family had grandchildren

2335
03:53:51.64 --> 03:54:00.60
and lived a quiet typically traditional American life but the early 1940s were not normal times

2336
03:54:00.60 --> 03:54:07.56
a fascist dictator threatened to conquer Europe and forge an alliance with the militarists

2337
03:54:07.56 --> 03:54:13.24
who controlled the Japanese government and they're distorted plan for world domination

2338
03:54:13.24 --> 03:54:19.96
and unprepared and unsuspecting United States became a primary target the American people were

2339
03:54:19.96 --> 03:54:25.56
shocked in the action by the Sunday morning arrival of Japanese bombers over a wahoo

2340
03:54:25.56 --> 03:54:32.12
like hundreds of thousands of other young Americans Anthony felt compelled to volunteer

2341
03:54:32.12 --> 03:54:38.68
to serve his country he simply could not stand aside while America was under attack

2342
03:54:40.68 --> 03:54:47.08
Anthony gave his life on tarua for his country his core and for his fellow Marines

2343
03:54:48.92 --> 03:54:53.08
he was not a famous hero more than a by millions extolled in the press

2344
03:54:53.08 --> 03:55:02.60
immortalized in magazine articles or books he was no one special just another marine private first class

2345
03:55:05.72 --> 03:55:14.36
the American people should thank god eternally for Anthony and his fellow Marines soldiers

2346
03:55:14.36 --> 03:55:22.20
see men and airmen who preserved and won a magnificent victory over a wickedly evil enemy

2347
03:55:24.52 --> 03:55:35.24
semper five brother you are not forgotten and with that Dean Lad has left the building

2348
03:55:36.44 --> 03:55:41.56
and actually who has joined us in the building looks like Jason Gargert, Jason Gargert's randomly

2349
03:55:41.56 --> 03:55:50.92
we are in spokane Washington spokane spokane spokane and since you originally linked me up with

2350
03:55:52.36 --> 03:55:58.20
the Dean Lad on a few random flights somewhere and you saw what was he just wearing like a

2351
03:55:58.20 --> 03:56:03.40
Marine Corps hat sure is one of the Marine Corps hats sitting there and I struck up a conversation

2352
03:56:03.40 --> 03:56:07.16
with them and the next thing you know he's like oh I was like wow what can I tell you

2353
03:56:07.16 --> 03:56:11.96
taro up and I was like holy cow and he goes out and wrote a book about it you don't have to be kidding me

2354
03:56:11.96 --> 03:56:16.20
it was awesome just so funny you text from the flight yeah and that you get so funny because

2355
03:56:16.20 --> 03:56:19.64
you and I were just standing out there talking to him you know how you get you know you and I are

2356
03:56:19.64 --> 03:56:25.08
used to hear in all of our friends say like oh well now it was in Baghdad or when I was in Marsha

2357
03:56:25.08 --> 03:56:29.24
or when I was in wherever I was in Ramadi and we were just standing out there and he's like

2358
03:56:29.24 --> 03:56:36.04
well you know when I was in side pan I was like that's so much better so much cooler than we are

2359
03:56:36.04 --> 03:56:43.88
dang it and that is the most ridiculous what those guys went through is completely ridiculous

2360
03:56:43.88 --> 03:56:53.16
and I know I mean I've since you know with the old breed is kind of the the the the way that I learned

2361
03:56:53.16 --> 03:56:59.96
like what those guys went through sledge Eugene sledge but this book is just right out right

2362
03:56:59.96 --> 03:57:07.000
there with it man it's right there with it and you're just getting gut shot while you're 500

2363
03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:14.60
meters from the beach at tarua yep you there's no way you're gonna live and yet you live and then

2364
03:57:14.60 --> 03:57:20.28
and then guess what you go to Hawaii for six months and then you're hitting the beaches of

2365
03:57:20.28 --> 03:57:25.48
side pan and then you barely survive that and then guess what you're hitting the beaches of

2366
03:57:25.48 --> 03:57:31.64
tinian and by the way all of this is after you were at the wild canal crazy it's completely insane

2367
03:57:31.64 --> 03:57:39.96
and by the way when he got back he got back in 40 August of 44 when he gets back he has like 32 days

2368
03:57:39.96 --> 03:57:47.80
leave one day for every month that he was overseas and then he's like none of those guys thought

2369
03:57:47.80 --> 03:57:54.92
the war was gonna end they just got done literally killing every single Japanese except for 17 on an

2370
03:57:54.92 --> 03:58:00.68
island they all fought to the death and then they think okay there's however many millions left in

2371
03:58:00.68 --> 03:58:04.76
Japan yeah we're gonna have to go kill them all we're gonna have to kill every single one of those people

2372
03:58:05.32 --> 03:58:09.000
that's what they were thinking so he was thinking cool I'm gonna be on short duty back here training

2373
03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:14.28
Marines for a year and then I'll be going back overseas as a as a company commander or as a

2374
03:58:14.28 --> 03:58:22.44
battalion X or whatever totally nuts they came up with a bomb that grew in to perfectly good

2375
03:58:22.44 --> 03:58:29.48
war is what I heard some of you say on this podcast yeah yeah that was that was Jim Kunkill said that

2376
03:58:30.44 --> 03:58:37.48
good so anyways it's it's so awesome that first of all that you manage awesome that I mean it's

2377
03:58:37.48 --> 03:58:41.56
it's just amazing to be able to sit here and talk to these guys and one of the reasons that we're

2378
03:58:41.56 --> 03:58:47.08
able to do this is because of the support that is given to us from you the listener

2379
03:58:47.08 --> 03:58:53.64
sure and what we've tried to do is set something up where you can support not only this podcast so

2380
03:58:53.64 --> 03:58:59.40
that we can continue to go around and talk to the Dean Lads of the world and capture their story

2381
03:59:00.28 --> 03:59:04.68
but also while you're doing that you can support yourself yes while you're on the path

2382
03:59:04.68 --> 03:59:11.72
it's a mutually supporting scenario yes which is a good thing so on the path what's the the first

2383
03:59:11.72 --> 03:59:17.64
thing that comes to mind obviously in my opinion due to so many due to just so many you need to get you get

2384
03:59:17.64 --> 03:59:24.92
and urgent or a genie yeah 100% that was a common question when we started this hey I'm starting

2385
03:59:24.92 --> 03:59:29.48
due to just a good of course that's good what you should I get common question easy no answer

2386
03:59:29.48 --> 03:59:35.32
easy no or if it wasn't for that question we wouldn't even be connected to or it was that question

2387
03:59:35.32 --> 03:59:39.72
and me telling people to buy originies even though I didn't wasn't connected with them yet

2388
03:59:39.72 --> 03:59:45.96
yeah so that's pretty cool to think about so please relax regards yeah I'll just

2389
03:59:45.96 --> 03:59:51.80
be wearing your legs right now by the way like right now some American denim origin jeans what

2390
03:59:51.80 --> 03:59:59.000

2392
04:00:05.40 --> 04:00:11.72
which are named after the may-con Delta which is where our forefathers served in Vietnam

2393
04:00:11.72 --> 04:00:17.72
and where our forefathers in the SEAL teams wore blue jeans because they were tougher and way cooler

2394
04:00:20.28 --> 04:00:26.60

2435
04:04:28.76 --> 04:04:33.48
origin we didn't say that it was made in america after we just talked for four hours with

2436
04:04:33.48 --> 04:04:39.08
someone that fought to keep america free and then we didn't mention the fact that everything

2437
04:04:39.08 --> 04:04:44.92
in origin is made 100% without compromise in the United States of america yeah that's pretty cool

2438
04:04:44.92 --> 04:04:50.52
just a cotton is grown see yes and that's the part two like you can say yeah 100% made

2439
04:04:50.52 --> 04:04:54.76
had to call these materials and I made them right here in america 100% which isn't even bad

2440
04:04:54.76 --> 04:04:59.08
I'm not even hating on that it's good but we're just like wait wait wait what about the materials though

2441
04:04:59.08 --> 04:05:04.04
you know okay okay I get it man okay all good either way but what about those materials

2442
04:05:05.24 --> 04:05:11.16

2449
04:05:48.52 --> 04:05:53.16
what do you keep saying that you don't think people subscribe to the podcast you need to

2450
04:05:53.16 --> 04:05:58.44
tell them no so I can't open door if I remember correctly which I probably don't but if I do

2451
04:05:59.000 --> 04:06:05.96
I my initial uh contention was that we don't have to say to subscribe to the podcast we don't have to

2452
04:06:05.96 --> 04:06:11.40
say hey subscribe you know what do we have to say that nothing oh I'll just subscribe to this

2453
04:06:11.40 --> 04:06:16.28
podcast if I like it kind of thing that I think I don't I think that was the whole contention

2454
04:06:16.28 --> 04:06:20.68
nonetheless why is it even there then why are we saying it that's the whole reason I brought it up

2455
04:06:20.68 --> 04:06:24.28
at that time it's like why are we even saying this remember but then we did like

2456
04:06:25.08 --> 04:06:29.88
sent you a message yes that's how that's described that's right yeah so it's like a good reminder

2457
04:06:29.88 --> 04:06:35.16
and then you're like see yeah okay it's all come to see thanks all right so so subscribe to the

2458
04:06:35.16 --> 04:06:38.20

04:06:55.000 --> 04:06:59.88
with the offshoots of conversations about your tattoo in life right yeah well here's the thing

2463
04:06:59.88 --> 04:07:03.80

2464
04:07:03.80 --> 04:07:10.84
with everyone that we know yeah that doesn't quite fit in the purview of jocopotcasts actual yeah

2465
04:07:10.84 --> 04:07:17.32
right like yes the jocopotcasts is for Dean lad yes it's not for Dean's director

2466
04:07:19.32 --> 04:07:25.000
but the Dean has Dean's been on it but like Dean's you know we we we covered the primary

2467
04:07:25.000 --> 04:07:30.12
jocopotcast type stuff from him but Dean has other information for us other things that we talk about

2468

have they been reading in school with your kids uh the fifth grade teacher yes because I

2497

I got a bunch of letters from the kids yeah they read it they're in the game they are they have a

2498
04:10:25.48 --> 04:10:32.44
pull a banner close now yes you know what that right there my mission in this world has been

2499
04:10:32.44 --> 04:10:37.08
accomplished that there's a classroom in America with a pull-up art every classroom in America

2500
04:10:37.08 --> 04:10:41.88
because they have a pull-up art and a couple of copies that were good so yeah check out those books

2501
04:10:41.88 --> 04:10:48.28
and Mikey in the dragons I don't know a lot of people as I as I always say a lot of people

2502
04:10:48.28 --> 04:10:52.28
think that's the best kids book ever written pretty well at least for sure at least I do

2503
04:10:54.28 --> 04:11:01.72
discipline goes freedom field manual you can get that book if you want to get after it and what's

2504
04:11:01.72 --> 04:11:08.44
interesting about that book is there's no book like it and my publisher I was like is this

2505
04:11:08.44 --> 04:11:12.28
the biggest risk you've ever took with published in a book and he's like oh absolutely not even

2506
04:11:12.28 --> 04:11:19.32
close there's no book like it it's totally outside of any other normal book so yes this is a big risk

2507
04:11:19.32 --> 04:11:28.36
but it it outperformed every model of sales that they had created for it like even though that

2508
04:11:28.36 --> 04:11:33.56
well if it really does great it'll be here it I did all that so why word a mouth and you all

2509
04:11:34.12 --> 04:11:37.72
spread the word so thank you discipline because freedom field manual and then of course there is

2510

2514
04:12:03.000 --> 04:12:08.44
in the arm and then you're good to go you need to do more persistent training over a longer period of time
