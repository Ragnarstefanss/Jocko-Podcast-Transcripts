00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is Jocco podcast number 41 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And tonight we are lucky to have a guest on the podcast. My friend, my teammate, my brother, Tony, a fratty.

3
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I'm going to start the podcast by reading a speech that I wrote when Tony retired from the teens.

4
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And for whatever reason, some reason that I don't remember, it was a worker job or some travel or something.

5
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I couldn't actually be there to read this myself.

6
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And that's the way the team is, you do your job, that's the priority. And I knew Tony would understand that I wouldn't be there.

7
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It would be no big deal to him. And I acted like it was no big deal to me.

8
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But I wanted to be there. And I should have been there in a row to speech. And I'm emailed it to one of our friends, one of our bros, another seal master chief.

9
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And he read it there. But I should have been there to read it myself.

10
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And you will hear that this speech is kind of like Tony is draw and straightforward and real.

11
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And so here's the speech that I wrote for Tony when he retired.

12
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Here we go. First of all, I apologize to Tony that I couldn't be there out in the desert today to see you off.

13
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
For those of you that are with him today, know this.

14
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Tony a fratty is a hero.

15
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000
A dirty, scrappy, rough, hard, mean bastard, but a hero.

16
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I've known him for over 20 years. And in those 20 years, I got to see him in many capacities.

17
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.000
First, as a young, hardcore, beer, swill in muscle car, driving machine gun in fist fighting third class petty officer.

18
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Then as an experienced hardcore, jacked Daniels swilling fist fighting second class leading petty officer.

19
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Next as a badass hardcore fist fighting knowledge filled first class training cell instructor.

20
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And finally as a seal, puttune chief.

21
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And we all know that being a platoon chief is supposed to mean that your hard core, it's supposed to mean that your experience, it's supposed to mean that your tough bastard, it's supposed to mean that your fearless, it's supposed to mean that you're a true leader of men.

22
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Unfortunately, we all know that that isn't always true, but with Tony, it's 100% true. Tony is without question, the primordial seal chief, the ultimate senior enlisted leader.

23
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.000
When I joined the teams, I joined a follow guys like Tony into unbridled combat into the violent fray into hell.

24
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I was lucky enough to work with Tony when he was one of the platoon chiefs in our task unit as seal team three from 2005 to 2006.

25
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Task unit bruiser. We started our work up here in the desert, the true forging ground of frog men.

26
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000
With a couple years on me, he was the oldest guy in the troop and therefore the primary representative of the old breed.

27
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And he represented the old breed with honor.

28
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
He immediately proved that he was physically harder, mentally tougher, and operationally superior to any of the young bucks.

29
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Really, it was August 115 plus degrees. He didn't get tired. He outshot everyone. He ran immediate action drills like Earl and Rahmall.

30
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
He didn't drink water. Seriously.

31
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Coffee and Copenhagen, that's it. And desert training was just the beginning. He led every evolution through the entire work up.

32
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Always coming up with the plan, always training and mentoring the new guys and everyone else.

33
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We trained and we trained hard.

34
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I drew a line in the sand. Tony held that line.

35
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We pushed the envelope and every evolution and prepared for war.

36
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Somehow, somehow, some way we knew what the future held.

37
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We deployed to Ramadi. I racked an April of 2006 and to our absolute joy.

38
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It was an embroiled war zone.

39
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We had been on the ground about a day when I went to meet the brigade commander.

40
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Tony was already out in the city in a sniper overwatch position.

41
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
As I walked into the brigade tactical operation center and shook hands with the Colonel John Gronsky.

42
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He said, one of your snipers just killed an IED in place or up on race track where we lost four marines three days ago.

43
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And that is exactly what he needed us to do. He needed us to kill them.

44
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
That sniper was Tony.

45
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000
With the first kill of the deployment, strategic due to its timing, timing that opened up the entire battle space to task unabrusor.

46
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And so we fought and fought and killed the enemy by the bushel.

47
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Tony was at the front the entire time.

48
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
He never wavered. He never faltered despite the heat, despite the danger, despite heavy casualties he constantly pushed to get out over

49
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and over and over again to kill the savages that were determined destroy of America and coalition forces.

50
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
He never asked for a pause or a break or a night off or a minute off.

51
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Everything that I ever asked of him, everything he did and he did it with every ounce of commitment and drive and self-lensess and professionalism that any human could ever muster.

52
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And we would talk and laugh and we would discuss what we could do better and we would come up with a plan and in the end Tony would give me a head nod.

53
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And that head nod meant he had it.

54
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It was done. He owned it.

55
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And I never doubted that. Ever.

56
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
He never missed an operation and applied himself to each mission with solemn gravity as the senior enlisted leader.

57
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
He poured over maps and imagery. He held detailed warning orders. He briefed the platoon with clarity and directness.

58
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
He led rehearsals. He did everything he could do to be ready.

59
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And his platoon performed magnificently accounting for hundreds of enemy killed.

60
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000
When his own men were wounded or killed and action had only fueled his motivation to kill more of the enemy to fight harder to slaughter more of the evil,

61
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
so a list of enemy and rid the world of their wretched kind.

62
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:08.000
That is what every seal should aspire to be like in Tony's words, BTF, a big tough frogman with no fear, no hesitation and no mercy.

63
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Just BTF through everything like Tony did.

64
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:29.000
For senior chief of fratis courage determination and leadership, I will be eternally grateful. I owe him more than I can ever repay him for what he did for me, for the task unit, for the teams and for our great nation.

65
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Let there be no doubt. The man before you is a hero.

66
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The teams are a worse place without his presence, his guidance, his leadership, his example.

67
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Those that served with him must strive to carry the torch and pass it on so that his spirit burns bright in the teams forever.

68
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I recently watched a movie about Lemmy Kilimister, the leader of the original classic heavy metal thrash band motorhead.

69
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The movie Chronicles, the Life of Lemmy, the hard-living rock and roll legend.

70
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The movie paints a picture of a unique individual that will never, that can never exist again.

71
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The movie is called Lemmy, 49% Motherfucker, 51% Son of a bitch.

72
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And that seems to suit Lemmy pretty well.

73
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And I'm not exactly sure how those numbers would break out for Tony, but I do know this.

74
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Tony of fratis is 100% frog man. Always was and always will be.

75
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Tony, thanks for everything. I'll see you on the other side.

76
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
BTF, Jaco.

77
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And with that, Tony, thanks for coming on the show.

78
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Thanks a lot, brother.

79
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Kind of forgot about that there and that was good.

80
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The guy we were talking about read it pretty good too.

81
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I didn't have like a big ceremony or nothing.

82
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
He went out to Nile and we got all gummed up and that was about it.

83
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
But I do appreciate it, man.

84
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It's good to see you, brother.

85
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It's good to see you, too.

86
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And you know, actually when I told people that you're coming on the show,

87
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
you know, people actually know who you are from the Liftetel.

88
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And lay, lay, sleep's been on here. We talked about you, you know, told some stories and shit.

89
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And so, but a bunch of people had a bunch of questions.

90
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And you know, I figured we try and get through some of them.

91
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We don't feel the answer all the ones that I got, but I picked out some of them.

92
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Let you take a look and pick out some of them.

93
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So, well, I mean, first and foremost, people just want to know kind of who the hell are you and where do you come from?

94
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
As funny, uh, few years back, like, uh, we're all in Arizona.

95
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I took a bunch of the guys and a platoon over to my parents' house.

96
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
You know, we had supper and every day.

97
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
You know, it was a wicked fun.

98
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Jeremy pulls me aside. He's like, you're actually have parents.

99
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
You're born around a rock somewhere in the desert.

100
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
He's like, shut up.

101
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
You know, that was pretty funny.

102
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Now, I'm from New Hampshire and, uh,

103
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
right, let's just probably like you, just, yeah.

104
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It's not so much wanted to be a seal.

105
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I just wanted to be something different.

106
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
You know, I could have went like a biker gang, or so I'm just as easy, you know.

107
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
You know, I figured if this, I have a pretty good chance to stay out of the clinic, you know, this way, but

108
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
not always, but a few times, you know.

109
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I'm fair now, but it seems just suited me because everybody's the same.

110
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Everybody, you know, everywhere you look, guys are doing what you would do and they act

111
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
how you would act and it's not always great, but, you know.

112
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So you, you got recruited, though, by some of the boys, like, over in the PI didn't you?

113
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I wanted to be a seal, but I wasn't like 1,000 percent, you know.

114
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And I was in the Philippines and I was like, all right, I got to do that.

115
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
That's it. So I went and got a screening test over there in Subeck Bay and, you know, I smoked it.

116
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And then, you know, they didn't have this long pipeline back then.

117
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I got there on a Friday. We got all gumbbed up and shaved their heads on Sunday and we started Monday.

118
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
There was nothing. That was it. Okay, go.

119
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Yeah, I actually, I know I was talking to the old master chief that actually was the guy that recruited you and told you you need to be a team guy.

120
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And I was talking to the other day when you were down at his house on the phone.

121
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Yeah, but, yeah, and he was one of my Patoon Chiefs as you know, but I told him, I told him the best thing he ever did for the teams was get you to enjoy the teams.

122
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
He was laughing. He probably probably probably would definitely have best thing for you. Oh, yeah, sure.

123
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Master walk, guys, a try. Yeah, absolutely.

124
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But it's just, you know, it's the teams like between us we got probably 46 years a team guy life.

125
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And it's so hard to put in perspective. If you don't know what you're talking, you know, you've never been there.

126
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
People don't know that we don't call each other seals.

127
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Yeah, you never say that. Nobody says when I joined Navy seals, it's like when I became a team guy.

128
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I just say that everyone just like turn their head go.

129
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
He's retarded. Yeah, it's come on really weird when you hear a team guy refer to being a Navy seal.

130
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Yeah, it actually makes you think, well, wait, do it the way second. This guy must not have actually been in the team.

131
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Yeah, okay, well, classroom. The immediate interrogation like with your hand cock behind your back.

132
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I think that's going to. It's going to give him so I gave his drivers license of black eye.

133
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Yeah, I don't know where that. I don't know where that comes from like where we don't say it. I guess maybe it's I don't know when I got the team wanted it was like, oh,

134
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
you don't talk about it. Yeah, you don't say it. No, no stickers. No t-shirts. No, no, you don't do any that.

135
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I'm sure all the possible punishment by death. Yeah, you know, say anything.

136
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I thought we were going to be an I'm the next day. Yeah. You know, you say, oh, good.

137
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
After a while, like, right.

138
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
What's happening here? Yeah, let's go on.

139
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Good. All right, man. Well, so that's Tony grew up in New England like me.

140
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And you know, did you ever hear this that they spent a bunch of money trying to figure out who's

141
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
going to go out and out? Who's going to go out? I know. I know. And the only literally the only two against wasn't big.

142
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
God was guys that wrestled and guys from New England.

143
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And it wasn't like a big difference, but you know, a normal person has a 26% chance of making it through and someone from New England had like a 37 or something like a small uptick.

144
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I mean, you know what? I think also that this good people out on the country don't get me wrong with New England as a pretty strong

145
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
work ethic. You know what I mean? Yeah.

146
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And I've seen that a lot a lot. And not that other people don't. Yeah.

147
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But all the guys, mostly guys that knew from New England and the teams that are pretty good work ethic. Yeah. Yeah.

148
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I think you just cold too. Yeah. That doesn't help. That doesn't matter. I think it does.

149
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Because I thought guys from Florida in my class like, those kids from Florida. There was a couple kids from Florida.

150
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And they were, you know, all loud and like they were just big tough guys that they were already in the teams basically in their own minds. And they all quit.

151
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I know. Well, like the first day of Buds and looking around, some of these guys, they're like, wow.

152
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Holy crap. These guys are like insane shape and all this stuff. I'm still hung over for the one ride from the P.I.

153
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
You know, like, you know, it's.

154
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And I made it.

155
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
They didn't.

156
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
It's. It's weird. You know, they just had this kid that quit Buds. And he went and jumped off of a hotel down in San Diego, killed himself.

157
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And I looked at a picture of him.

158
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
He missed the pool or something. No, there was no pool to jump into. He killed himself.

159
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And he did it right.

160
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Yeah.

161
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
He succeeded.

162
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
But I was looking at him. I was talking to one guy that we know who's instructor over there.

163
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And I was looking at a picture of the dude and the dude was like,

164
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
just like, distracting guy all buffed with like, blood there. It just looked like a total stud.

165
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And I go, man, that kind of looked like a stud. What happened?

166
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And then instructor guy said, dude, they all look like that now.

167
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Like everybody's just, you know, it's a big deal. Hey, I'm going to go in the

168
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Seal things. I'm going to go in the Seal teams. And that's what they're saying.

169
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So they're recruiting is really easy, but they're recruiting all these studs.

170
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
But it doesn't matter. They cherish the same.

171
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Yeah.

172
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
That's why, you know, you know, that the government wants more and more tingles.

173
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So just ain't going to happen. No. It's not unless you lower the standards.

174
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And if that happens, then we've all not done our job. Yeah. That's just terrible.

175
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Awesome. All right. Get some of these questions here.

176
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
It says here on the first podcast with Lavey discussed a story,

177
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
which Tony came up with a strategy for an open and Tony told Lavey to be better.

178
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
The brief would be better coming from Lave.

179
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And it says, where did you develop this humility and this characteristic of not

180
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
worrying about individual credit versus be team objectives?

181
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
So to rehash that story real quick, it was real.

182
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
We were out at the desert training facility and we were just planning you plan in some like,

183
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
you know, we do iteration training. We just got to go to go to.

184
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Yeah. There's just one of those. And they changed the target or something.

185
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And you're like, OK, here's what we need to do.

186
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Put guys over here, put it over, watch over here and walk through online like this.

187
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And Lave's like, hey, sounds good to go.

188
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Watch get the guys over and brief them.

189
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And you said, hey, sir, you know what? You go ahead and brief them.

190
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
That way, it sounds better coming from you and that'd be the way to do it.

191
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And he was like, well, all right, you know, he was fired up.

192
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And when I saw you do that, I was like, because this is the thing.

193
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And I forgot to mention this, you and I have known each other for a long time.

194
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
We both have together.

195
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And we had the same friends and we hung out at the same places.

196
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
But we were never in a platoon together.

198
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And never worked together directly together until we were in tasking a bruiser.

199
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So when I got to Nile and I knew your reputation, which was rock solid,

200
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
but I don't trust anybody about anybody.

201
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
No, I was a customer.

202
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Yeah, I'm a customer.

203
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
So I just, you know, so I'm seeing you kind of for the first time out there of actually working.

205
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And, you know, that was a big indicator to me.

206
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I was like, damn, you know, this guy is totally humble.

207
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Wants to make his officer look good.

208
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Wants to make his, which is only going to make the platoon better.

209
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
It's only going to make everybody better.

210
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
So yeah, that was awesome.

211
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
And what a great attitude to have.

212
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And I get asked that all the time people is, you know, my boss is doing this.

213
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And what should I do? I'm like, well, give him support.

214
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Trying to help him.

215
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Yeah.

216
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Trying to make him look good.

217
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
But we think it's tuned away.

218
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
People who is their ego of them want the credit.

219
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Right.

220
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And you see this up, maybe you can see this all the time in the two clips.

221
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
So anyways, where did you realize that?

222
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Did anybody teach you?

223
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Or where the hell did you know to do that?

224
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I can read and watch people pretty good.

225
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And I watched some guys who kind of brought me up in the teams.

226
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Some of the guys we were talking about earlier.

227
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And I tried to kind of mimic them, but then it kind of morphs into your own.

228
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Shit, you know.

229
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
No.

230
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And, well, the first thing is, I was just tired.

231
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And my voice was gone.

232
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I just wanted him to do it.

233
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
No, just kidding.

234
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
So tired.

235
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
So tired.

236
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
But yeah, like, get over there.

237
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Boss and do your job.

238
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
But, I mean, some of them guys in that that puttune,

239
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
they were already my chums like Chris Kyle and Bob and Jeremy.

240
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And I'm guys been around a while.

241
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And they already, you know, I put them through training and I am warfare and I am not one.

242
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
So they, they know me.

243
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And I was doing a lot of that shit.

244
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And I'm like, no boss, you do it.

245
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Because basically he's new to them.

246
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Not new in the teams, but he was new.

247
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And I figured he's got to do this more and more and more.

248
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Yeah.

249
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And he did.

250
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Of course, you know, a wave stepped up like a gangbusters.

251
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
It was a great officer.

252
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
But in that, then beginning stages, like,

253
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
all right, I've already done this a million times.

254
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Yeah, I don't care.

255
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I'm a good, you know, you want my advice great, but come on, let's just get the ball roll.

256
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I see it.

257
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
And so if that answers the question.

258
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Yeah, that was, and again, that was always that it to do you had, which was,

259
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
he never cared about looking good yourself.

260
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And part of that is you just had such a good reputation in the teams that,

261
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
what are you going to do?

262
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Look even better.

263
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I'm going to get another Navy calmer.

265
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
But, but, you know,

266
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
a lot of people, so if you're listening and you're wondering, you know, what makes,

267
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
what makes somebody a good, like a good NCO and it was a lot of Marines, a lot of soldiers

268
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
listen to this.

269
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
What makes a good NCO?

270
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
You don't always have to make yourself shine.

271
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
You don't always have to be the guy that's the center of attention.

272
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And as a matter of fact, generally, that shines through as being a guy that wants

273
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
to be the center of attention.

274
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Yeah.

275
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Instead of a guy that wants to have a good bull to.

276
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And it's not like it was doing it to make rank.

277
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I didn't expect to make you five.

278
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I don't know if I can see your G.

279
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
God.

280
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
All right.

281
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Next question, please detail the way you were able to use decentralized command

282
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
when running task in a bruiser and how it was met through the other commanders.

283
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
So for those of you that don't know decentralized command means you're going to let your subordinate

284
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
leadership lead and you're not going to micro manage everybody.

285
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And that's definitely what I did.

286
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And I didn't micro manage.

287
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Well, I should I should rephrase that.

288
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
We have people need to be micro managed.

289
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
I'll micro manage them.

290
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
They're jacked up.

291
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I'm going to be all in them.

292
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And like you're talking about with life and with Seth and over with the other between the Delta

293
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Poutine commander.

294
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I'm micro manage those guys.

295
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
That crazy when we first got in.

296
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Yeah.

297
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Because I was just making sure they were good to go.

298
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Just because they worked that experience and just like guys that don't trust anybody

299
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
when you don't know.

300
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Yeah.

301
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And then, but the goal was to just have them be able to run on their own and make stuff happen.

302
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Because I'll tell you another thing, you can't run everything yourself.

303
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Nobody can.

304
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
No.

305
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And so you got to decentralized command.

306
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
And that's what I did was I let, you know, when we got on deployment, I wasn't micro

307
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
manage anything.

308
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I was barely I was just kind of broad guidance.

309
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Right.

310
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
And then you guys were running the stuff and making things happen.

311
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I mean, I would have loved to be on every operation.

312
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
But I physically couldn't because we had multiple obstacles going on.

313
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
We had to split forces.

314
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So what are you going to do?

315
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
I got no problems with anyone in that group.

316
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
The lowest guy running it on.

317
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Yep.

318
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
But you got to let your, you like, I let the boys basically screw up.

319
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Because then you don't know how they're going to react.

320
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Okay, do they just sit there and pound me.

321
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
And then you got to slap more of or do they, okay, here's what you did wrong.

322
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Roger that.

323
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And then immediately we start thinking how to fix it.

324
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Because everybody fucks up everything.

325
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
What's face?

326
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
I mean, we're never always good at anything.

327
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Still ain't really good at much.

328
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
There's BTF through.

329
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
But all and so it doesn't seem like we made mistakes.

330
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
I mean, really.

331
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Yeah.

332
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
But leadership is funny because some guys take to a like water.

333
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And other guys are scared to death of it.

334
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Yeah.

335
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000
You know, lately I've been realizing that because people always say, you know, our leaders made or born.

336
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And can you make a person that's not a good leader into a good leader?

337
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And I look at it kind of like when you see these video games where people have different strengths and weaknesses.

338
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Yeah.

339
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And a guy might be strong and high intellect and good agility.

340
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And I don't know whatever those games pay her posture.

341
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Yeah.

342
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
So with leadership the same thing because there's certain elements, certain natural things that you can have that make you a good leader.

343
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
For instance, it is a real simple one.

344
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Can you be loud?

345
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And in the sealed teams, if you can't be loud, that's going to be a problem.

346
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Like you can't just take control of a room, be like, you know, hey, everyone get in this room.

347
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Yeah.

348
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Can't do that.

349
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
People can hear you.

350
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Then you got to find a way around that.

351
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Right.

352
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Are you articulate?

353
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Can you simplify things that are complex?

354
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Because there's all these little things that you get ranked, you basically all ranked that.

355
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
And some guys have they were born low rankings and they either find a way to make up for them.

356
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
They learn how to do them better or they compensate by using somebody else.

357
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
You know, if I wasn't loud, I'd be like, hey, Tony, tell everyone to get in here.

358
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Then you could do it.

359
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Right.

360
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
That makes total sense though.

361
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Yeah.

362
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
If someone out there is a leader of Ben and Wester's position, you know exactly they're talking about.

363
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Yeah.

364
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And sometimes it's, you know, hey, what's the problem?

365
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
No, really, what's the problem?

366
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Well, okay.

367
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And like you said, good.

368
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Good.

369
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
All right.

370
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Now you identify to go work it out.

371
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Don't sit around and cry about it and just go do it.

372
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
You know, and you got five minutes.

373
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Yeah.

374
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Go check out.

375
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
I think the other thing with decentralized command, that's important is for everybody to know what the limits are.

376
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Like how far you can go in direction or another.

377
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
And I know that, you know, like I always trust, you guys are going to do the right thing.

378
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Well, like you said early on in that work up, you know, leadership at every level.

379
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
You know, even the junior guy, it's his responsibility to keep me in check if something's going wrong.

380
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Because if I'm doing something stupid, he's like, hey, Tony, what would it?

381
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Oh, yeah.

382
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Okay.

383
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I lost it there for a while.

384
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
You know, like sometimes I'm old.

385
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Sometimes I lose it once in a while.

386
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Oh, I'm not going to apologize.

387
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Yeah.

388
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Yeah.

389
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Nice.

390
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Anything else like decentralized command?

391
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Well, it's, it's a lot easier if you start right from the beginning trying to make everybody understand decentralized command.

392
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Because that's the goal.

393
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
It has to be the goal because someone like you, you can't.

394
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
You got to be somewhere else.

395
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
You know, we, we didn't want you on the battlefield with us.

396
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I wanted you on the battlefield.

397
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
And every time you were, I was like, oh, this is awesome.

398
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
But I mean, I really, really needed you back where you were.

399
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Of course, you know, and that is, everybody had a, like, wicked high level of confidence.

400
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Just knowing that you were back there, taking care of watching her back, you know, and never sleeping.

401
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
And just doing like 40 pull ups, sweating and then trying to eat everything in the camp.

402
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Yeah.

403
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Yeah.

404
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:29.000
It's, it's a thing that you talk about as far as getting everyone to know that and understand that from the beginning is for sure.

405
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Oh, yeah.

406
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I mean, everybody's got to know that man, you know, I, I don't want, like, my favorite thing is I go out on an operation with you guys and not do anything.

407
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Now you just shoot around.

408
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Just shoot around.

409
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Just okay.

410
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I'm just in the train.

411
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I'll know that's, that's the way it should be because the leaders are leading because life is doing his job.

412
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
He's leading the athletes, the, the breach team is doing their stuff.

413
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
And I'm just like, okay, cool.

414
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
I'm basically an observer, you know, now to a point.

415
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Yeah.

416
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
All right.

417
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
That was the death of this.

418
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
You.

419
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
But, but that's the way you want it, you know, and, and then when something does happen, you can then handle it.

420
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
You can step in and go, okay, hey, guys, we need to back off over here.

421
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Okay.

422
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
This, this is going wrong.

423
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And, and that's the way it should be.

424
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
So if that's your goal, though, is to say, look, I want to go back to the end of the day.

425
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I want to say, look, I want my leaders to lead.

426
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I don't want to be doing all their job form.

427
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
When, first of all, that'll make them more confident.

428
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
It'll make them more capable.

429
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
And then when something does happen, then, and they need your assistance, you're not bogged down with something else.

430
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
You can step in and make it happen.

431
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Right.

432
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I think it's, uh, take like our aircraft, can't stand.

433
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
That's why combat vets coming back.

434
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
And they talk about decentralized command.

435
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
It's important because if you're just doing the same like army training and an army unit goes over there.

436
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
What are they going to do, go?

437
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
All right, guys.

438
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Now we're doing decentralized command later.

439
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
You know, you, you know, until that happens, you know, you got it.

440
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Now they come back.

441
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Okay.

442
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
We need to train like this.

443
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Yep.

444
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Here's our junior officers need to do.

445
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Here's our antsy.

446
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Oh, he's need to do.

447
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Here's our E5's.

448
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Are he for us?

449
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
You know, our private's.

450
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
There's what they need to do.

451
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Yep.

452
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Good.

453
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
All right.

454
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Next up.

455
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Uh.

456
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Take talk about some failures in planning leadership and how you built back up.

457
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Yeah, we didn't, we had none of that.

458
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Everything went perfect.

459
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
You know, one of the things that I think of when it, and I guess it's really a failure.

460
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
But we would oftentimes make a decision.

461
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
And then in a day or in a week decide, yeah, that wasn't a good call being over.

462
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
And I think a good example of that is how we kind of task organized and we split up into different groups.

463
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
And we're like, okay, you guys are running this area.

464
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
You guys run this area.

465
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And then like two weeks later, actually know this area is not good.

466
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
We're going to move the guys.

467
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
We're going to join them back together.

468
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I always felt like everybody, especially us and the leadership, you know,

469
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
we were all like, okay, cool.

470
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Yeah, we just made a mistake.

471
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
We just move on.

472
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Not even a mistake, but you got to change.

473
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
You got to adapt.

474
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Yeah, you got to.

475
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
You got to morph into something.

476
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
It's like, if you're doing, you know, a lot of our lots.

477
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Then it's kind of a no-brainer.

478
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
If you go over there and all of a sudden, you know, all you, you're working by yourself,

479
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
boom, boom, doing your mission is great.

480
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000
But if you work in split forces and you're training indigenous forces and you do in that,

481
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
you have to have the, you know, you have to,

482
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
and it's not always easy to adjust for because it's like there's a world of different

483
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
swing-out rack and Afghanistan.

484
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Like a world of difference.

485
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
I mean, it's all kind of the same, but stuff I didn't Iraq and then do an Afghanistan,

486
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
you know, in vice versa, like, whoa, can't do that.

487
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
You know, even, even stuff like the weather, you know,

488
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
talk it, you know, all of a sudden, a snowing.

489
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
You know, and then the terrain, like people think Iraq's all does it.

490
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
I mean, there was some places where they were like in the jungle.

491
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
It's like we're in NAM, you know, or Cambodia, great sakes.

492
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
And like, well, you know, okay, we're going to walk, how many clicks?

493
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Yeah, well, when you're up to your waist and mud,

494
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
you know, all of a sudden, that timeframes totally off because we didn't,

495
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
you know, made a mistake.

496
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I didn't really, really, really did terrain.

497
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
You know, and ask about it.

498
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And she was been up there before and she had, but.

499
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Yeah.

500
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
But we just adapt.

501
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
No, we can't exactly.

502
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
I think that's a big example.

503
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
It's learned from your mistakes.

504
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Yeah, when it comes to failure, it's just, okay, what do you do now?

505
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Yeah.

506
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Yeah.

507
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Yeah.

508
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Okay, let's, let's adapt and move on.

509
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Yeah.

510
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
All right.

511
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Um, next one.

512
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Okay.

513
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000
I really want to hear you talk about the battlefield and how it made you feel.

514
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And the type of situations when the shit hits the fan.

515
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Well, I kind of questions pretty easy for me.

516
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Like how the battlefield made me feel.

517
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I can say, is it made me feel much better than any other place than the battlefield.

518
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You know what I mean?

519
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Yeah.

520
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Because everything makes sense on the battlefield.

521
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Very, really, going forward or getting going away or defending our position or moving out.

522
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Yeah.

523
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Out of that, what else is there?

524
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Because all of them things, even if you have men down and people wounded, you still got to do them.

525
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yeah.

526
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Well, as I said, you're a thing about this.

527
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So our optempo was very high, meaning the operational type of little for the go see that don't know what that means.

528
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
It means like how often you're doing work and the optempo was very high.

529
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And so what sometimes for whatever reason, let's say an operation would get canceled or push back.

530
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And all of a sudden Tony would have been in camp for like two days.

531
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Well, the second day, like the first day he'd be, you know, okay, he's coming up with a plan.

532
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Something else, you know, him and Leigh for trying to figure something out to do, but then the second day, he's just just started to get all frustrated.

533
00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Yeah.

534
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Place around the tourney.

535
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
What?

536
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Well, hey, this is just stupid.

537
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Yeah.

538
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Oh, it's max.

539
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
We're going to go to like the big base and like, country music, concert or something.

540
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I'm serious.

541
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Like, I was like, I've been a stand.

542
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I flew into a can die.

543
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Yeah.

544
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And he's guys like, oh, you just missed.

545
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
I can't remember what country's said.

546
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
They're going to concerts and stuff. I mean, ratchet stuff up in a mountains, you know, like, really?

547
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Well, these people do in here. Why aren't you a murdering the bad guys?

548
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
God.

549
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Yeah. So Tony, you would get very frustrated after like two days and then you just come in and I say, okay, do it up here.

550
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Just go this area and go find something to do and then you go make a plan and you and Leigh for come back.

551
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
All right. We got something we're going to go get it.

552
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
But you got you got to admit though, you know, time off is not such a good thing.

553
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
I mean, a couple days break now and then, but you got to keep the boys busy.

554
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Yeah. And they start thinking and they start getting, you know, but I mostly did it for me because I just wanted to get after.

555
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Yeah. There's definitely you can smoke them, but you're right.

556
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
If all the sudden they're sitting around all the time, they, is a, what's that, a body and motion tends to stay at

557
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
motion in a body, it's a sense to stay at rest. So if you start lagging and all of a sudden you're going to go do an

558
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
up and everyone's kind of resistance. There's not not not verbal resistance just just like I'll shrug the

559
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
shoulders. Just like a resistance of some unseen resistance in the world that want you to slow down.

560
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:42.000
But when the shit hits the fan, you know, it's, it's strange because it makes me, like,

561
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
a little bit like a little calmer, I think. I mean, not always. I had the first, first time I

562
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
reached out. I was a little jittery, a little bit. But, you know, oh my God, what's going on?

563
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Actually, I knew what it was. You know, it's not like, oh, what's that? Actually, I actually remember you were

564
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:08.000
briefing some of the guys when we were back and you were like, um, you were like, hey, you know what?

565
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
I'm training. When I, when we went through training, we were getting ready to go to Ramadi. We didn't work on on this right here.

566
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Oh my God, what's happening? Yeah, there's this too. Oh, this is going to be cool. Yeah, it's all that bad stuff.

567
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Then there's screaming, yelling, diving into shit shooting and killing.

568
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
But, you know, it's kind of, it is fun.

569
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think the thing I've said on here before is that the battlefield and all these situations, they just give you this clear focus and

570
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
life that nothing else gives you. No, well, nothing that I've found.

571
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Me, this is like, oh, we're going to kill people are going to get killed ourselves.

572
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
That's everything in the world. Right. That's what it comes matters. No, that's it. Just like sitting and camp watching TV.

573
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:09.000
That doesn't matter. No, okay. You got your ass to you. Okay, you good. You know, all right. No, let's go.

574
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:23.000
All right. Next one, not to take away from the seriousness of what you two have achieved in the seals, but I would like Tony to tell a funny story about Jaco.

575
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
And the reason I put this one in here, of course, I don't like to hear any humor or any laughter in the world.

576
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000
But there was a bunch of people that said this. So anyways, I figured you might have a story.

577
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:49.000
I got like seriously like a million, like a million. I mean, that story about you and your roommate, like, you're, you're like,

578
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:57.000
you guys live together in Coronado. Yeah. You know, I'm talking to you with the big fella. Yeah. You're like, those over there patty in one night.

579
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
We're getting gonged up. And you're like, you know what our bill was from Domino's.

580
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
It's like $2,500. That's a lot of fun.

581
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
That was so funny. That's a wicked good patty, though. Yeah, we did have some pretty good money.

582
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:23.000
And then one time we're out at Nylon. It's like two o'clock in the morning. And the guys are, you know, they're, we call that after you're done.

583
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Do the work on the vehicles post post off of vehicles and they're all busy doing stuff.

584
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000
And I mean, I'd help out if I had to, but I mean, it's not my job. So, and they boys know what to do. Jeremy had him.

585
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Great, I'll be home. And we're sitting there and me and life and maybe one of the other jails.

586
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
We're shooting this year about something. I mean, I had to do a work because what else is there?

587
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:59.000
And life was talking and there's quiet kind of, and you got your eye on one of the humvies and all the sudden you just out of nowhere.

588
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
You just kicked a dirt and you go, God, do it!

589
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000
You're like, shaking your head and clutching your face and like, the fuck you talking about.

590
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
And he just like, look, it means smile and walk away.

591
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
What? What? What is wrong with you? Still not a figure that I was wrong with you guys.

592
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
I know what I remember. You just went, God damn it.

593
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
No, I was actually getting frustrated that there was a chance we might not go to Iraq.

594
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Like I was so scared and horrified of that.

595
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
You know, and I was just trying to control it, but then it just kind of slipped out.

596
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
And here's another quick one about Jaco.

597
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And my, I don't know, we were there a couple of weeks in Ramadine.

598
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
We're just falling into a group operating in one night, a losing his office because it's like,

599
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
couldn't sleep or whatever.

600
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And he's like, look at that, and you show me.

601
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
He shows me the computer. He goes, this is from my wife.

602
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Are you okay? You've been gone three weeks and we haven't heard anything from you.

603
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
I'm like, calm, you better even tell your wife, she should get a fly over a kill.

604
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I talk about detachment a lot.

605
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:31.000
And sometimes, you know, like I said, sometimes you get over there and you got all that shit going on and nothing else in the world matters.

606
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
I didn't have anything going on back here, and then mattered to me at all.

607
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Sorry, uh, to my wife there for not see.

608
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
I'm sure she can remember that.

609
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Anyway, you did though.

610
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
You're like, okay, I got it.

611
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Yeah.

612
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
All right.

613
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Here's one. What made you realize one of your guys was really good to go or was not up to standard,

614
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
not necessarily big things, but micro actions or decisions that set something off in your mind?

615
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Well, I had a lot of guys work on them. You know,

616
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
and I mean, I really think that, you know, all my brothers and the teams,

617
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
everyone was good to go. Even the guys I didn't get along with, I'd still get my wife form in a second.

618
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.000
It does matter, but I want to think that sticks out to me. It was bigdles when I was Ryan Job.

619
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.000
You know, I, I don't, I guess I could have been more like a nice whatever, but I'm like,

620
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
man, you look like you're fucking fat. You better get in fucking shape, but I'm going to fucking kill you.

621
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
I'm not going to like, write you up. I don't even know how to do that.

622
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000
I'm going to, I'm going to just physically kill you. And man, you know, I don't even know if he was in good shape or not,

623
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
because some people you can't tell. Yeah. They like, look at that guy and then he just knocks it out.

624
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
That people that hired marshmallow. Yeah. And man, that kid did.

625
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
I mean, he really, really did. And like, all of a sudden, I'm like,

626
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
John, well, I didn't say that. I was like, hmm, I, you know, so that was like,

627
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
yeah, that was like my praise. Yeah. Yeah, whatever. You'd hide the praise from the next one.

628
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
On the next thing. Yeah. But I mean, that was really good.

629
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:23.000
You know, remember one of my guys lost a piece of equipment one time.

630
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
You know, I was kind of upset with them, but it just made me realize that, you know,

631
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
if we're making a mistake, maybe it's not this guy's fault, maybe it's my fault, maybe it's everyone's fault as a team.

632
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Because it's the day, it's all of us. So maybe what I take a day or two of.

633
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
You know, and that kind of helped, you know, we handled it.

634
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:55.000
I mean, and another one of my guys, he was Christmas and he left a piece of equipment open or didn't lock something.

635
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I mean, it wasn't a big deal. I could have corrected it right there.

636
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
But the guys are just taking off on Christmas leave.

637
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
And I was dead nowhere to go. So I was drinking beers in the team area.

638
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
And I just walked around checking shit out and sure enough.

639
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So I called the guy and he was like, three or four hundred miles into his drive to a western state for Christmas.

640
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
I'm like, he goes, oh, I'm sorry. I'm like, yeah, no problem.

641
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
All right. So turn around now and I'll be waiting for you.

642
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
It was dead silence on the phone. He's like, what? Yeah.

643
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Yeah. So he drove all the way back.

644
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I know a stand there. It was like, four in the morning now.

645
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
And I was like, it was pretty licked up by then.

646
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
And just few men, but he's like, I'm sorry.

647
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
We won't be Western. Yep. Okay. Have a good leave.

648
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
And I'm sure I'm positive. He never did that again.

649
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000
That'll do it. Yeah. It was kind of a dank move I guess, but you know, I figured it was a thing to do.

650
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
He who suffers remembers. Yeah.

651
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Yeah. It's the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the.

652
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
The the the the. When you're just working with guys all the time.

653
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
You definitely start to pick up.

654
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Things and you can indicate. Okay. Yeah. This guy's this guy's stepping up.

655
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
You know that's what I always noticed when things are going to go.

656
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And things are going sideways like in a training operation and you see a guy that's starting to step up.

657
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
You know that was always a good sign absolutely. You know, so like he's going to handle.

658
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:37.000
It's like that's when you train decentralized command. That's what you got to let guys make mistakes and screw things up because you know the last you know more you're sweating training unless you bleed more.

659
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
No doubt about that one.

660
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
All right.

661
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Next one.

662
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Tony were their situations while in Iraq when you disagreed with a leadership decision made by the or jaco.

663
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:59.000
If so. How did you express your disapproval and were you successful in getting your point across.

664
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Most of the time 99% of the time.

665
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
No, I did not.

666
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
There was one big one that I really disagree with you guys on one.

667
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
I was like, well, I'm going to be a little bit more focused on my request to keep the entire troop there for another year.

668
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
You said you couldn't and I tried why not.

669
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And you're like, we can't and I'm like, why?

670
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Well, and I was really, really, really angry about that.

671
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:32.000
But yeah, I think I think this this question here is is from someone that's thinking that doesn't really understand how we're working.

672
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
You know, in the bottom line is I'm not coming down and going,

673
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
I'm not coming down and going down and going down and going down and going down and going down and going down and going down.

674
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
All right, men. This is what I want you to do now.

675
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
No, we would just form our own operations.

676
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
We're all kind of bouncing ideas off each other.

677
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
The best idea rises to the top.

678
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
I don't care who it came from.

679
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
I don't care if it came from me, Tony from one of the new guys.

680
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
It doesn't matter to me where the idea comes from or where the plan comes from.

681
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
I want the best idea to rise the top.

682
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
That's one of the best things about our troop was there was no one that was like trying to drive their own personal way.

683
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I didn't care. I literally didn't care.

684
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And I think part of it is like you and me just had planned so many operations.

685
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
It just, you know, we just didn't care.

686
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
It's like, oh, that's cool. You'd be, yeah.

687
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
That sounds like a good plan. You know, maybe make this adjustment, maybe make that adjustment other than that.

688
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Cool. Let's execute it.

689
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:30.000
So I think that's a little bit different than then what people would envision as like I was the commander.

690
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Or because we're just not operating like that. Now this is why I've said to people very flat, even though there's even though the the military and the seal teams and there's definitely a higher archery or a little structure.

691
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:50.000
I mean, that's the way it's organized. There's the troops and then there's you know leading petty officers and then there's a platoon chief and there's a platoon commander.

692
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Then there's a troop commander or task unit commander and there's a team commander.

693
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
So there's a structure there.

694
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
But the the as far as how we actually come to plan and stuff like that.

695
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000
There's yeah, I mean some guidance, but we're working as a team to do that and that's what and I would say it's not always like that.

696
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
In fact, I know it's not always like that because I saw other platoons and other troops act and do different ways.

697
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
But we did operations that came from our commanding officer.

698
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Yeah, it came all the way down.

699
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Yep.

700
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And some of them were wicked good.

701
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Except, they'd give the maybe the mission objective, but they wouldn't be telling us like going here.

702
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
No, but then we've never that's not the way it works.

703
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:41.000
So I think that I mean the situations when you disagree with me was probably in one hand you could say never in another hand you could say a million times.

704
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Yeah, you're like, no man, we shouldn't do that and I be like, oh, why not? Oh, we should put the vehicles in there. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's a good point.

705
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Yeah, that's that's how we voiced it by saying, oh, yeah, let's do that. So I'm like, oh, okay.

706
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Yeah, that's good. Yeah, yeah, because no big big big what's that? Like a big soap opera leadership.

707
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
No, not out of nothing that never happened.

708
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
And so if you don't have that kind of relationship with people number one, is it your own ego that's getting involved?

709
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Because that's probably that's a good indicator if you're like, well, you know, my subordinates just don't understand.

710
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Really, really. Why not? Okay, why not? Maybe suck as a leader then, just do it like good.

711
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
You know, maybe if you did better, they wouldn't understand the mission.

712
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:36.000
So pretty flat organization we had at least from a planning perspective. Yes, sir.

713
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:46.000
All right. If you had to pick one driving characteristic that separates a dominant alpha team guy from everyone else. What in the teams?

714
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:56.000
What is it? Well, if guys in the team, as you got to know this, but a lot of people out there don't that like pretty much everyone's an alpha male.

715
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
You know, it's like nobody gives up the argument ever.

716
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:12.000
You know, usually it's, you know, wrestling or fighting and it always works itself out, but I think one thing we're talking about is gimmicks.

717
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Like a lot of people in the teams, I call it a gimmick. Everybody's good at everything pretty much and does the job.

718
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:30.000
But some people like just insane skydivers, some guys are just phenomenal rock climbers, some guys are just like swimming, sons of guns, you know,

719
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:38.000
or runners and wrestlers and fistfighters and there's, you know, some people just in the guns. I mean that's their passion.

720
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Some people are just phenomenal divers, you know, and I was always pretty good at everything, but not great.

721
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000
You know, I couldn't outrun everybody. I couldn't outfight everybody. I couldn't out swim everybody. I couldn't out shoot everybody.

722
00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:06.000
And I just, I think mine was like tactics and just being as hard as I could. And I, I, I made it look easy, but it was and the specials I got older.

723
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:12.000
It's no fun being a team guy when you're 44, you know, and you get up and you're like,

724
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:24.000
I'm like, I better retire. I'm not done with all this. But yeah, if that kind of makes sense.

725
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Yeah, if the other funny thing about that is, because in the teams, no team guy ever wants to give any credit to a different team guy.

726
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000
So if someone was like, hey, you know, that guy's a really good shot and then someone immediately, but you know, you ever, you don't know how to swim though.

727
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Yeah, we used to talk about it. Always just like someone's always really, you know, one's good at everything.

728
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Did you work? You know, did you? And if they can't take a something out, they'll be like,

729
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
whew, whatever, fuck that guy.

730
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Just walk away. Hey, what, what are you going?

731
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

732
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000
You know, one thing I'll say that is pretty cool. And I already brought this up. Like one of the things that that

733
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
separate, like what when I worked with you that first time, and I saw you like being humble,

734
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.000
I was like, man, that's that to me is the characteristic that you can tell the guy is not just a good team guy,

735
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
but an awesome team guy when he's humble about what's going on. And when I was putting guys through training,

736
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.000
and I know you saw this too. The guys that would come through training that thought they were all badass and thought they couldn't do anything wrong.

737
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000
They were always bad. Like they never did a good job. Right.

738
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:35.000
And then the guys that were say, hey, man, I'm looking forward to training. I know we need to go and need to get tuned up and let me,

739
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
let me don't know what I can do better. Those guys were taking notes. They always kicked ass. They always did a good job.

740
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Yeah. So that being humble is being humble too is.

741
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
I read a bunch of afteraction reports.

742
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
You know, and my tour is over there about different situations, different things. And every time they were well written by some guys,

743
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.000
but you'll always carry this. You'll always do this. Never do this. Always do that.

744
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000
And I kind of took that in a count when I wrote a serious afteraction report for that deployment.

745
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
I wish you would have saved it too. It was just pretty good.

746
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Yeah. First and foremost, this is what worked for us in these months, this environment, this temperature with this mission set,

747
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
and what we had to do. Don't use this as, oh, he said that. So I'm going to do it every time.

748
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000
No, I mean, using this a guy, everything that teams is a toolbox.

749
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000
You pick it out when you need it and you use it and you put it back away.

750
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
And if it sits in there for 500 years, it's still worth having because the timing pull it out,

751
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
you're going to really need it.

752
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Yep. Yep.

753
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Next one.

754
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:52.000
In the teams, what were the biggest reputation builders or killers?

755
00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000
And for those of you who don't know, in the teams, and I guess it's the same anywhere, but it definitely is true in the teams.

756
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Man, your reputation is everything. It's everything.

757
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
And people know who you are. They know if you do something stupid and like, really stupid in the teams.

758
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Everybody knows that. Everybody knows it forever.

759
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Like if you have an accidental discharge,

760
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:26.000
with meaning meaning, if you shoot your gun when you weren't supposed to, and there may be some scenarios where there's a little bit of leeway on that.

761
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
But if you just do it, no dumb situation, everybody's going to know about it forever.

762
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Yeah.

763
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
And that's just like you might as well just get a tattoo on your forearm that says, hey, I had an AD on this day.

764
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Yeah.

765
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:41.000
If you do something stupid, you know, something that gets you in trouble like just dumb.

766
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Yeah, you're probably going to just everyone's going to know about it.

767
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:52.000
They're always going to think about it. If you get fired from a position, and you happen to not get kicked out of the teams,

768
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Everybody's going to know about it.

769
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Everybody knows it'll just get out.

770
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Yeah.

771
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Yeah.

772
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000
It's it's it's a tough community when it comes to reputation.

773
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000
It's a really, it's wicked brutal.

774
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Yeah.

775
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
You know, every, it's like a small town.

776
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Yeah.

777
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Everybody knows everything. Even though you're on other coasts.

778
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Yeah. I mean, I've done a lot of stupid shit in my career.

779
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
And I was a jerk off and dumb, dumb stuff and then an idiot.

780
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Everybody knows all that. Yeah.

781
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Yeah.

782
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:30.000
You know, most of the stuff that you did, fortunately, is kind of is like on the okay side.

783
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Yeah.

784
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
I don't know how to explain this.

785
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Oh, yeah.

786
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
It's only got drunk and got invited this thing.

787
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Yeah.

788
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Yeah.

789
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
It's almost, you know,

790
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
back to cool and the big to do with uniforms and stuff.

791
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Yeah.

792
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Wouldn't have like to do with like the things that you kind of can't do or you can't get away with.

793
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Or it'll affect your reputation and bad way wouldn't have more to do with how good of a team that you are.

794
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
You're right.

795
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
You're just, you're just called right.

796
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
You know what it has to do with.

797
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Is it something that hit that helped or is it something that is operational or not?

798
00:53:59.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Yeah.

799
00:53:59.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Yeah.

800
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
So it's something that's operational.

801
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Everybody knows it.

802
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:13.000
You know, like if you, I mean, even like you'll hear about a guy that gets lost in buzz in and you or like gets lost going through the initial training.

803
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
But when he got to the team, he gets on land on land navigation and gets lost and has to get rescued.

804
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Bro, that's just going to stick with you forever.

805
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Like, like I remember, you know, I remember getting like three briefs about some guy that I was getting in a platoon about where this guy got lost.

806
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
I was stupid.

807
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
It was, you know, there was a highway.

808
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000
He could have walked the highway.

809
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
You could hear the cars.

810
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Everyone just made a spectacle out of this kid.

811
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
And I mean, the kid got out because eventually he got me.

812
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
I just get out of this.

813
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
This is horrible.

814
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Yeah.

815
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
I'm going to do things I can't.

816
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
And so yeah.

817
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000
So this question is actually is actually a decent question because that definitely does play a big thing.

818
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
So for me, and it's the basis for a lot of nicknames on the team.

819
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
True.

820
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
True.

821
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
True.

822
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Yeah.

823
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
If you do something that's excessively stupid or just a lot of things.

824
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Or just have bad luck.

825
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Like one of my favorite ones is Bush.

826
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
You know, Bush.

827
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000
A cuss.

828
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Yeah.

829
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:14.000
But he like was parachuting and when he first got to the team, this is a new guy and in his parachute, he landed in, uh, in, uh, what kind of bush was I?

830
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Some kind of a bush with thorns and what.

831
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Yeah.

832
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Parish you got all tangled up and he got stuck in there.

833
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
The guys.

834
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
That's the name.

835
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
He's great too.

836
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
He's an awesome guy.

837
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Yeah.

838
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Bush.

839
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000
There's the blue other things.

840
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
There's team guys where you don't even know what the real name was.

841
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Actually, I was kind of like that.

842
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Nobody knew what my actual name was.

843
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
My was just jacco and that was just, was my civilian nickname.

844
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
My parents gave me.

845
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
But the funniest was there was a guy and I'll just tell the story.

846
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
There was a guy and you know him.

847
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Cuss I do.

848
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
But, uh, but anyways, his name was Al.

849
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
And I was always like, you know, I knew it was Al.

850
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
And then he was a heavy weapons instructor.

851
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
So we called him big Al and then we called him big Al 50 cow.

852
00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Yeah.

853
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000
And it was Al 50 cow.

854
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
I knew big Al 50 cow for like eight years, right?

855
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
And one day, I'm like, you know, we're talking and I would do some.

856
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
We're going on a trepours.

857
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I knew his name because I was in a couple of put to it.

858
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Yeah, I did paperwork.

859
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Yeah.

860
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
So I finally get to pay it.

861
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
I found to get to paperwork with this guy was also a real quiet guy.

862
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Me real professional real quiet.

863
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Yeah.

864
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
He's all.

865
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
He didn't say much.

866
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
And, uh, one day, I'm doing the paperwork and I go, hey man, I'm like, look at the list of people.

867
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
It's coming.

868
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
I go, hey man, I thought you're going on this trip with us.

869
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
And he's like, he's like, yeah, yeah, I'm going.

870
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
And I go, oh, you're not on the manifest here.

871
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
And he goes, no, and he comes over he points out his name.

872
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
And his name is Keith.

873
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Yeah.

874
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
And I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, bro.

875
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
I go, well, your name is Keith.

876
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000
I go, you own when it, that's a mistake.

877
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
You don't want me to get a change.

878
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
He goes, no, no, that's my name.

879
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
And I go, well, I thought your name was Al.

880
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000
I go, is Al your middle name.

881
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
And he goes, he goes, no, Al's not my name at all.

882
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
And I go, I go, whoa, whoa, what do you mean?

883
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Why does every single person call you Al?

884
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
And he goes, well, he goes, well, in my first platoon.

885
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Well, I was out doing something that was night.

886
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
And I was, I guess I was looking around and moving my head a lot like an owl.

887
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
And so the guy started calling me owl.

888
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
And then over the next platoon, it changed from owl that just moved into owl.

889
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
And then Al, and then his name was Al.

890
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
And I literally would've told you this guy's name was Al.

891
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
And he never corrected, he just said, you know, whatever.

892
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
You call me Al, that's close enough.

893
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000
So that'd be F or somebody named Na Na.

894
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000
So that's Big Al 50 Cal.

895
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
But you know what?

896
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
His reputation was, because the question about reputation.

897
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
His reputation was awesome, because he was solid.

898
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
He was a form of a ring, one of it.

899
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Uh, I was he.

900
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
No, that was 295.

901
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Okay, 295 was in the koa.

902
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
But, you know, solid reputation.

903
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
So for me, and I guess, I mean, it's, it's what you do operationally.

904
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Yeah.

905
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Is what build your reputation.

906
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.000
And if you're a good shooter, if you're not, you know, shoot, shoot like an idiot.

907
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Um, not, you know, if you can patrol well, if you have good field craft, all those things.

908
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000
The real things, right?

909
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Right.

910
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000
It's kind of cool.

911
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
That's what's kind of cool.

912
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
That's one thing that's in the teams.

913
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
That's that's hard for them to erase.

914
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Is what your real reputation as a real comber player has an operator team guy.

915
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
That's the thing that all these people that, that kind of come and go in the teams,

916
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
and it's, it's maybe it's not, they're not real real team guys.

917
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
You can't fake that, you know.

918
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
And when guys get some guys get shot, bone up, you know, wounded, and some can't operate anymore.

919
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
It's not like we throw them to the wolves.

920
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
They want to stand the teams.

921
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
We keep them to take care of them.

922
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
And so, and become phenomenal and struck this and just go on and do great things.

923
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Yeah, they were going to keep, if Ryan Job would have won a stay, they were going to keep them.

924
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
A cuss.

925
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Yeah.

926
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Oh, you're blind.

927
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Cool.

928
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Yeah, so work for great.

929
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
You can lead BT.

930
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Doesn't mean you can't listen to me when I say go to this.

931
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Yeah.

932
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:13.000
And then contrary to that, obviously the killers are when you, when you screw up stuff,

933
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
operation, the other thing is if you're an arrogant, egotistical guy, you'd be everyone's going to hate you.

934
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
That's, yeah.

935
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
And you ain't going to last long.

936
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Because if you're, because there's some guys that are great, skill wise, they're great operators, but they're horrible to work with.

937
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
They're arrogant.

938
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
They don't listen to anybody.

939
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
They're not humble.

940
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
And those guys will have a bad reputation too.

941
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000
They got blindes on.

942
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
They can't open the, you know, and you got to, if you want to evolve at all,

943
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
they'll stay alive, you know.

944
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Nope.

945
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Yep.

946
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Alright.

947
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Next one.

948
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000
What makes a great NCO in, and philosophy, not the military.

949
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
An NCO is a non-commissioned officer.

950
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:59.000
The military is broken into two basic, basic pathways of advancement and of existence.

951
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
There's officers who are like the managers and the leaders.

952
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And then there's the enlisted guys, which are the grunts, but then as they get promoted through the ranks, you eventually become.

953
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:19.000
What's called the senior enlisted advisor, and if you don't, if you think about Hollywood movies, the way they always categorize these two is you've got the young,

954
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
junior officer, fresh in Vietnam, fresh out of the academy.

955
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And then you got the salty old gunnery sergeant.

956
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
That's the two.

957
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
That's the two.

958
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So the NCO is the, is the enlisted side of that.

959
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And NCOs, they always say is like the backbone of the, of the Marine Corps, the NCO, the chief.

960
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
The, the chiefs run the seal teams is the, is the statement, right?

961
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Because the chiefs, the guys that, chiefs, the guys that will be at a seal team,

962
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
especially in the old days, being a seal team for eight years.

963
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So you are the continuity and you get raised.

964
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So the question is, what makes a great NCO and who is or was the best NCO you know?

965
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Well, for me, what makes a great NCO or chief is,

966
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I don't think you can just do it.

967
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I think it's, uh, I'm not saying I'm a great NCO,

968
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
but I did have great NCOs who taught me a lot.

969
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And they brought me up and they put their foot in square in my rectum when I needed it.

970
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And they also took their time to explain things to me when they could see in my eyes.

971
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I was nodding my head, yes, but I was really, I didn't grasp it.

972
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I was like, I'm going to do it this way and they would work around my for lack of better word

973
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
learning disabilities.

974
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Because I mean some of the stuff you can't, you know, when you're a new guy,

975
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
you're just like, you're cheap or a cheap and they're like, no dummy relax.

976
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Here's like you're doing.

977
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And that leadership style went a long way with me and I never forgot it.

978
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
You know, who's the best NCO you've had or ever known?

979
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Man, there's so many guys that it's not one.

980
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I can't say their names because, you know, it's not clear, I mean,

981
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
but that's a good thing about nicknames sometimes.

982
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know, I think, I'll have to say overall, Mr. Fak was probably the best one I ever had.

983
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And he was just an old school, hard-ass son of a bitch.

984
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But he was fair as all hell. He was fair and you always knew where you stood with him.

985
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And I love that. That's what I tried to do later on.

986
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Like, I didn't want to go hot, hot, hot, hot and then totally taken out the direction

987
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and just be like, easy on the guy. So they'd like me, you know, I don't care.

988
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And I thought that was much easier in a better way because mission men is how you should look at things.

989
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
But the mission first and take care of your men.

990
01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But sometimes if you have to sacrifice men and you got to like, okay, you got to die for this mission.

991
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
All right, Roger that.

992
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I don't think that's the way the military is. That's what you get paid for.

993
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
But yeah, Mr. Fak was probably the best one for me.

994
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Yeah, so that's another, when I talked about you and me coming up in the teams and hanging out

995
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
the same people and being the same, but we were going to put them together. But we did have the same guys.

996
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Yeah, right.

997
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Yeah, right.

998
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The same guys raised as both. And for sure, Mr. Fak as you, you are calling him was a huge influence on me.

999
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I'm a huge influence on me.

1000
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Right.

1001
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Everything I was or am, well, everything I was in the teams like as far as being professional.

1002
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And like, hey, we're going to, that all was taken from Fak. All of it was taken from him.

1003
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
100% material.

1004
01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And the seriousness that he put towards the job, like the gravity that he put towards the job and the gravity

1005
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
to put towards the operational stuff that we just talked about.

1006
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
As far as, you know, the things that we said makes up your reputation, that's what he cared about.

1007
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Above anything else, that's what he cared about.

1008
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And so for sure, working for him. And that's, that's again. That's why when we actually started working to, and I'm just realizing this right now.

1009
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I mean, I guess I made sense of it before, but when we started working together, that's why we had the same thoughts and things.

1010
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Right. Everything was, like, of course, we're going to do that.

1011
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It's like when we're bounding back one time somewhere in Iraq and just we didn't even have to say anything.

1012
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Each other would just like cover and move.

1013
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Go, go, go, go.

1014
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
But one thing real quick about it, NCO, one of the best I ever had, another seed daddy of mine, and I can say his name because

1015
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Rest in peace, Tim Farrell. Tim Farrell was a big, big influence on my life.

1016
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
He was a wicked good operator.

1017
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I can't, I don't know anybody. He was a tougher guy in the teams.

1018
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
He's just a hide, hidden guy, and just, he's a really good dude, man. Really good guy.

1019
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And he was awesome at everything. Everything. Everything.

1020
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Yeah, he was an awesome, everything he did.

1021
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
He beats you at everything. He would beat guys in the slums and he wasn't wearing fins and they were,

1022
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and he was just incredible athlete.

1023
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yeah, and incredible athlete.

1024
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And by the way, he was, he would, he's not like a guy that was like, well, you know, I didn't get my workout in today.

1025
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So I don't know.

1026
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
No, no, he's not like a guy that was like, well, you know, I didn't get my workout in today.

1027
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
So I don't know.

1028
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
No, he's not like a guy.

1029
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
He was like, oh, just, just get after just every year.

1030
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Yeah, yeah, Tim Farrell, first year was a great guy.

1031
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
What a frog man he was. He certainly was.

1032
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
All right.

1033
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Anything about accuracy of fire in combat versus volume of fire.

1034
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And I'll tell you the reason I left this one in here, Tony is a lot of soldiers and marines and team guys that I hear from all the time.

1035
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And they always are listening. And not only that at this point, but I hate to say it, but in America, our our police forces need to start thinking about this kind of stuff because there's bad stuff happen America where guys are getting in legit.

1036
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Yeah, urban warfare.

1037
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And so talking about the accuracy of fire versus the volume of fire.

1038
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Well, you know, it's a double, it's a flip of the coin on depends on the situation, but I can tell you the number of times I fired.

1039
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I fired a rifle and a salt rifle, a F-14 and all that, you know, a scar on full auto is big friggin goose egg.

1040
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You know, I can't think of one situation, if somebody said, okay, Tony, you're going to this room alone and this eight guys point and guns at you.

1041
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Well, okay, Rogers that, but you know, but sometimes, you know, volume of fire gets heads down if you're in the street.

1042
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You got to get that fire, you're going to try to gain fire superiority.

1043
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000
And if you don't have that, you ain't really moving. And so at that point, you're not doing all the things you were taught breathing.

1044
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
You're just getting led down in that direction.

1045
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So, cover your ass. Well, your buddies ass. So, you can move and they can move.

1046
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.000
But accuracy of fire and combat, you know, in good situations, if you're under fire and you're putting lead down range.

1047
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
So, you can move. It's real nice to have a supporting element in an elevated position.

1048
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
There are the ones combining these two.

1049
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And this is a pretty good example. It's pretty nice knowing about four blocks from you.

1050
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
You got Chris Kyle up there talking you on the radio.

1051
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Hello, no!

1052
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
You see, guy fall, I like the window with a gun, you're like, thanks brother.

1053
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:54.000
You're pretty confident walking down the street at that point. So, yeah.

1054
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:03.000
The other thing is, I mean, we always have massive firepower with Mark 48, Mark 46 is laid down.

1055
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.000
The heavy volumes of fire. And that's the same thing Roger Hayden was saying in here the other day.

1056
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:22.000
He was another, you know, burst that mentor, you and me growing up in the teams. And, but he said that they had four, 60s in their 14 man puts in like two stoners.

1057
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
So he's no, four, 60s and five stoners.

1058
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
That's what he said that was what they carried.

1059
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Yeah, so eight, you know what's interesting too, like we talked about points, you know, but the guys like all of our guys are AW gunners put sights put the eight cogs on there on there.

1060
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Which was, yeah, partially for PID so they could tell who they're shooting at, but could see further, but also man accuracy.

1061
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yeah, it's a four power scope.

1062
01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And that night I don't matter because you're using an app to the other laser and you're on nods anyway. So, and then one last thing is that you know again now we're talking to aimed at police officers, but also also guys in combat, you don't have unlimited ammunition.

1063
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
So you got to think about that too.

1064
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Me and my brother just had this conversation.

1065
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You know, he's like, well, I wish I could, you know, conceal weapon carry, you know, it's got, say I got my revolver and he's got like a six 86 stainless P or plus, you know, seven shot, 357.

1066
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I wonder where he, he wanted to revolver, I told him.

1067
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Yeah, that's a good thing.

1068
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But he's like, you know, should I, what I'm conceal carry should carry some speed loaders and like, well, John, is that always convenient? No, well, you know what, you're not getting in a gunfight, you're not.

1069
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000
If you get in somebody's shooting, you either shoot him or you put down fire and you run, it's not your fight.

1070
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:08.000
You're just jacking your car or whatever and they pull gun, you shoot him, yes, but you know, it's a night club shooting or something. You blasting your way out of there.

1071
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And that's it. You're not going to sit there and you don't have unlimited ammo, right?

1072
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And even in the teams, we didn't, that wasn't my biggest fear.

1073
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I would hate to die of lack of shooting back. And that would just suck.

1074
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
You know, we never really did run out. We got low.

1075
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:35.000
A few times, but never really run out. That's scary. That's why we kind of trained on, you know, we did a lot of that were try to set a standard you can't, you know, if you got a shoot, you shoot.

1076
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000
If you run out, then you go to your pistol, if you run out of that and you go to your grenades, whatever, and then you just beat the F.

1077
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:51.000
But, but we trained, you know, if you're sustained fire flights, like M4 gunners, you know, after 4 mags, you're going to start slowing down.

1078
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
So I'm thinking about round-comers, conservation. Same thing with the machine gunners.

1079
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Start slowing your rates fired down.

1080
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Initial bursts, initial ballies, and then go down and like, you know, shorter bursts, more time looking at what you've seen.

1081
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Because if you're out there hanging with your ass hanging, you know, and you've got no rounds, then guess what?

1082
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's run time. And nobody wants to run. That's just terrible.

1083
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Awesome. All right.

1084
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Uh, next one,

1085
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:33.000
What is Tony's perspective as an enlisted and older guy serving quotes under you as a younger officer?

1086
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So I don't know if this person actually understands it. We're about the same age and it had been in the teams about the same time.

1087
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Right.

1088
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And we were more brothers than, like, anything else.

1089
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And then, uh, what was it like, what would you like to work for compared to other guys you were under?

1090
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Well, that first part, that first part is pretty easy. Cause I remember you and Lafajotachen, like, we didn't know who the chuckle guy was.

1091
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And I kind of was walking by the office and it's like a movie where I stopped, like halfway through a step and I backed up and I went, would you guys say,

1092
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Yeah, this new, uh, masculine commander. We don't know who he is. What's his name?

1093
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Like, willing, chuckle, chuckle, chuckle was something like that.

1094
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I'm like, yeah, we're all set.

1095
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
And then they're all like, you know, because they're the two lieutenant, Seth and Lace.

1096
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And they're like, following me to the head and like, relax.

1097
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
What about what about this guy? What a good to go.

1098
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I mean, we sure were getting them and like, yeah, yeah, it's done. He's just coming. He'll be like tomorrow.

1099
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yeah, yeah, all right. Let me just tell you something. Be square away tomorrow.

1100
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I said, walk away. You know, this guy and I was like, you know, is he, is he good to go?

1101
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
When I just looked at what, my game that looked like, please.

1102
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I know what I'm talking of.

1103
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Be square away to the bottom.

1104
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Yeah, and you better be on your game.

1105
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I mean, I'm going to be hung over tomorrow. Whatever. I know him forever.

1106
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But that and what were you like to work for?

1107
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
What, what you like?

1108
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
This is not even a question. He was great.

1109
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It was the best ever.

1110
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I mean, just, I don't know. We think the same.

1111
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
We, we're, we're like minded.

1112
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And we like, we like to work.

1113
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
We really, really love their jobs and our men and our people, you know?

1114
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And I hate saying I love my man that sounds kind of whatever.

1115
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But, you know, I did. I really cared about the guys.

1116
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
That was the best part of being a team guy.

1117
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
And I'm sure Jockel backed me up on that.

1118
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Absolutely.

1119
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
His brothers.

1120
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Yeah, I know doubt about that.

1121
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
No doubt about that at all.

1122
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
All right. Next one.

1123
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Please, expound on the early days when you and Tony were new guys in the teams.

1124
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
This is like a whole no other podcast.

1125
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Okay.

1126
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Go ahead.

1127
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Well, I don't know.

1128
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
It was kind of a different time when we were new guys like,

1129
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Wait, my first Petune, we were involved.

1130
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
You know, like the first Gulf War and I thought it was,

1131
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Well, that was great, you know, and we really didn't do much.

1132
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
My Petune didn't.

1133
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And, you know, some of them guys were there for six months.

1134
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And I was like a month or whatever.

1135
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And then it was done.

1136
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
You know.

1137
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But I don't know.

1138
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I think in the later stages of my career,

1139
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
we didn't train as hard.

1140
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
But the deployment.

1141
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I mean, we still trained hard.

1142
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
But the deployments were harder.

1143
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Like more work.

1144
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And back then, if you did the deployment where it was like,

1145
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
a training deployment, because there was no war going on.

1146
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Be stud, the deploy.

1147
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Be learn realising.

1148
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
There's no wars.

1149
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Team guys are still deploying to same up tempo.

1150
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And because we need constantly be around the world.

1151
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Okay.

1152
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Something happens.

1153
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And, but we did a lot like hard course shit.

1154
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Like we did a lot more reconnaissance work, which meant we didn't have vehicles.

1155
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
So we had LPCs, which are leather personnel carriers,

1156
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and we were doing boots.

1157
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And we'd hump in like 25 clicks or whatever.

1158
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And we'd do these ridiculous swims and these long dies.

1159
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And do all, I mean, really like long like the higher the better.

1160
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I mean, you look at a team to put it in perspective.

1161
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You look at a team guy back then.

1162
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
A lot of them were a lot leaner.

1163
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
You know, and they, we did a lot more runs swimming.

1164
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
You look at like a team area now.

1165
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
You go to the gym.

1166
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And it looks like WW, you know, MMA wrestlers.

1167
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You know, I mean, they do.

1168
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Everybody's like, like stronger and not because you got to carry more shit.

1169
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
We do a lot more direct action stuff.

1170
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But also we did a lot of tricking and party.

1171
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It's fine.

1172
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And San Diego we did.

1173
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I know that.

1174
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And we hung a lot together.

1175
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Nobody was married.

1176
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
You know, I don't, we had like 16 guys in my pitoon.

1177
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
One was married.

1178
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And he was the LPO.

1179
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Yeah.

1180
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
No one was, no, we all hung out together all the time.

1181
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
We all like lived in Imperial Beach.

1182
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
They're like, chill list.

1183
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Now people live like 40 miles away and like everyone's married and owns a house.

1184
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Nobody owned a house.

1185
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
But they have any money.

1186
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And those boxes.

1187
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah, we, yeah, we had a house like five guys in the apartment with like one, one couch.

1188
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
That was just disaster.

1189
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
The guy that you were talking about earlier that I lived in a corn on a with.

1190
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And for quite some time, we had we in our house.

1191
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
We had we only had one fork.

1192
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
So it'd be like, it'd be like, hey, man, are you almost done with the fork?

1193
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Because I want to be out of your mind.

1194
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I couldn't go to vans by another fork.

1195
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I could really see that happen.

1196
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
You two gorillas.

1197
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Yeah.

1198
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
That was that was funny.

1199
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
So that when I, when I remember one of the big things I remember about checking it a team one was

1200
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
was just not even looking people in the house.

1201
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Because it was this this reputation and and of just you're just going to get beat down.

1202
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Yeah.

1203
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
We got hazed a lot.

1204
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
So yeah, we got beat up.

1205
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
We got hazed and a lot.

1206
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
You didn't, you know, you didn't come in there thinking that the world owed you anything at all.

1207
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Yeah.

1208
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
No.

1209
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
The only thing they owed you was an ass beating.

1210
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Right.

1211
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And, you know, we had some big monster guys at the team.

1212
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I remember I checked in and there was this one guy, you know,

1213
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
probably the biggest guy at team one.

1214
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I'm not going to say his name again, just because I don't want to jay.

1215
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Yeah.

1216
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Ginslow to jay.

1217
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'm checking it.

1218
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
You know, I'm at the team and I'm doing over there doing some pushups or something.

1219
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And I see this guy come out of the gym.

1220
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
He's literally how tall is he six six.

1221
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Yeah, about the six six.

1222
01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
300 pounds.

1223
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
He's a monster.

1224
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
He's a completely covered in tattoos.

1225
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And he's walking.

1226
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's about a 40 meter walk from the back of the team.

1227
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
One building to the to the area where we keep the outboard motors and stuff.

1228
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
And he's walking.

1229
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
He's lumbering, right?

1230
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
He's lumbering along and about 20 meters into this hike.

1231
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
He stops and he's got a gallon of milk in his hand.

1232
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And he just, he stops like stops and uncorks the milk and just sits there.

1233
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Drinks half a gallon of milk slowly puts it back down.

1234
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Puts the lid back on and the lumber's the rest of the way over.

1235
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I'm like, good Lord.

1236
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I hope that guy doesn't eat me.

1237
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
But kill me and eat me.

1238
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And so that was definitely the team one thing when I got to team one.

1239
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I was everyone was just big bunch of tough mean bass.

1240
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And they were getting ready to kick your ass at any time.

1241
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Ali, bass.

1242
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Yeah.

1243
01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And in, you know, I think, you know, nowadays there's a war going on.

1244
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Right.

1245
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
And so the guys have a different kind of test ahead of them.

1246
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And that's cool. You know, that's different kind of test.

1247
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And it's a harder test.

1248
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And it's, that's, that's what we, that's what guys joined teams for.

1249
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
So the young team guys that are coming in, freaking badass.

1250
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Awesome. Absolutely.

1251
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And I, it's a what man people say whatever about what they want to say about the way Millennials are and all this stuff.

1252
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Man, I've been to some hanging out with some team guys, especially after some memorials and stuff.

1253
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
These young frog men did their badass.

1254
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
That ass guys that are ready to die or kill without question.

1255
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And so respect and I'm so glad to see where the teams maintains that always.

1256
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Absolutely.

1257
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
All right.

1258
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
If Tony had to write for the history books, three top stories of

1259
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Shiny example of BTF getting after it. Oh, they beat this.

1260
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Give me one.

1261
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Give me one.

1262
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Oh my god. Everything. Everything.

1263
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
There's so many good ones.

1264
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
It's hard to say just one guy.

1265
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
You know, but, uh,

1266
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I don't know.

1267
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I don't know. I'm one time when me and, uh,

1268
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Dober did that like thousand yards center peel.

1269
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
That was pretty hard to contain that it didn't bother me.

1270
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That was hard, man.

1271
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I mean, that was, that was pretty odd.

1272
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Like, I mean, this is a tactic with two guys.

1273
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
This is two of us bringing up the rear of this, this extraction.

1274
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
You know, actually, yeah, it wasn't extraction because it was by foot.

1275
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Otherwise, it had been an expiltration.

1276
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
But we kind of took up the rear.

1277
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
We started like covering moving.

1278
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And then guys, we just on a dead rod.

1279
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
But we had to stop.

1280
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Go stop. Go.

1281
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
For about like a mile or whatever.

1282
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It was just terrible.

1283
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I mean, I was sweating like a teamster, man.

1284
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I mean, I was just, and because it was like,

1285
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Beta clock in the morning, girl.

1286
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
And it's like 110 degrees out.

1287
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
That was pretty good.

1288
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
That was a pretty good one.

1289
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
But I remember getting back to the old days with that.

1290
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
We didn't save ETF back then.

1291
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
But we should do some horrendous hams.

1292
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
You know, humping to the civilian world means like marching,

1293
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
not marching by patrolling.

1294
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And be like, look at the map.

1295
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And we didn't, we didn't patrol in the day.

1296
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
So it'd be like, all right, it gets dark at like,

1297
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
19 hunting.

1298
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
We're going to move out about 1930.

1299
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And it gets, we're going to stop at about 0.5.

1300
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And we got to cover, I don't know.

1301
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
40 collects.

1302
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
All right, let's go.

1303
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And you're 100 pound rocks, acolyte.

1304
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Really?

1305
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Okay, let's go.

1306
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
You think.

1307
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
All right, couldn't have been a plumber or something.

1308
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Oh, no, I don't mean a team guy.

1309
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I couldn't have been like, what the call is?

1310
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
No, no, no, no.

1311
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Yeah, you know, and you were kind of talking about this earlier.

1312
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.000
But I remember times where you guys be out the field for two or three days.

1313
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And meanwhile, while you're in the field, we're spinning up another opportunity.

1314
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I'm not going to have another target for a direct action mission.

1315
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And you guys get back.

1316
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And you'd be like, hey, man, we got a target for you.

1317
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
You're rolling out in two hours.

1318
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
So, and you know, you just go to your guys and be like, all right,

1319
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
guys, change your gear.

1320
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
It had an outskill.

1321
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
You were loading vehicles in an hour and 30 minutes.

1322
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And you see, guys, just turn and burn.

1323
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Yep.

1324
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Yeah, nobody said, who really?

1325
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
No, just do it.

1326
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
You know, yeah, my whole.

1327
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
That that platoon that I had on that deployment.

1328
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I mean, I'm guys BTF.

1329
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I mean, especially like the sister's kids, those guys were, you know,

1330
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
we had the new guys, we had the older guys,

1331
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and then we had the middle guys.

1332
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
You know, you know, you know,

1333
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000
spas and the squirrel and Chuckie, those guys with racks.

1334
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Those guys were badass, man.

1335
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Because for sure.

1336
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I mean, they just, they didn't.

1337
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
They were the meat kind of over the platoon.

1338
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And there were the ones that had to do it like most of the work.

1339
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
You know, the new guys helped them.

1340
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And the other older guys were more of leadership positions.

1341
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Yeah.

1342
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
And they still work too, but these guys worked.

1343
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And they just like, got rid of that and just got after it.

1344
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Good dudes and I.

1345
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
After day after day.

1346
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I guarantee after day after day after day.

1347
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I guarantee all them guys.

1348
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And I couldn't keep up with everyone after every tired.

1349
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I guarantee all of them guys are doing well in their careers.

1350
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Because they're fantastic.

1351
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I do see them and they are all kicking ass.

1352
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Roger that.

1353
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
That's good for sure.

1354
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
How does Tony decide what strategies tactics to use on a mission against an enemy?

1355
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
curious about your thought process?

1356
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Hmm.

1357
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Well.

1358
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000
First of all, you got to figure out which we were talking about.

1359
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:19.000
My experience in the savages that we slayed and killed and shot.

1360
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
First of all, it's better to shoot someone in the back.

1361
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000
So, you know, a little in ambush where you can catch him walking away from you as always the best.

1362
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
But front, just beat the F and figured out.

1363
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
We're talking about Sung Soo there, you know, the out of ward.

1364
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000
You know, I thought, you know, he says, if you know yourself in your enemy, you don't need to fear thousand battles.

1365
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Whatever.

1366
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Well, I know myself pretty damn good and I know my group pretty damn good.

1367
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And I have time to read all that stuff and figure it out.

1368
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
So I figured I just hate the enemy.

1369
01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I'll just hate him and that hate will few of my passion to make the operation as best I can.

1370
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.000
And work at the best I can and learn from the mistakes that didn't work out.

1371
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:15.000
That kind of when you got that, the kind of pyramids down and everything kind of works itself out.

1372
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.000
You know, and you can't be afraid to try something different because and you can't be afraid to bounce it off people.

1373
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
That's was great about Jocco.

1374
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I would bounce something off of them, you know, anybody.

1375
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Yeah, that's good.

1376
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Or he go.

1377
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
No way, to make it.

1378
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
You wouldn't let it go, you know, if you like, can I walk me through this again?

1379
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Roger, we're going to do that that.

1380
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:45.000
And I would also really when I'd let other people run operations or I would work with other groups.

1381
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I would just kind of wait for when they scanced over something and I'd go, well, wait a minute.

1382
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Okay, go.

1383
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Now, what are we going to do here?

1384
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Well, you know, we're just going to do this.

1385
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I don't know what that means.

1386
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Please explain it to me.

1387
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Well, and they hadn't really thought about it.

1388
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And that's the little glitch in the mission plan that's going to get you killed.

1389
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000
But you can't, you know, you can't take a lot of time to plan it up sometimes.

1390
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Sometimes it's like, all right, you know what?

1391
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
On the salt, here we're going to go.

1392
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
We're going to go in strong like Cowboys or we're going to go on the prowl.

1393
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
We're going to go in a safe dishes entry.

1394
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Be real stealthy.

1395
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Sometimes you can't.

1396
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Sometimes it calls for a straight up punch him up.

1397
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
You know, just mix it up and beat the F.

1398
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You know, and that's easy to do because you don't get to plan much.

1399
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Okay, let's just go there and kill everybody.

1400
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Show us where they're going.

1401
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Yeah.

1402
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Yep.

1403
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So I don't know if that answers that question.

1404
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000
But yeah, and from my perspective, I mean, and you just kind of made it sound like big, no big deal.

1405
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000
But Tony was always pouring over the imagery, looking at the maps, trying to figure out which angle

1406
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
trying to figure out what the best spot trying to, that's what he's doing all the time.

1407
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Just trying to analyze as much as he could and make the best plan.

1408
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And I think also, man, the experience level, you know, because I said, right, even even pre-war pre-911.

1409
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
How many freaking obstacles did you and I do training obstacles where we did all this stuff?

1410
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
2000.

1411
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Yeah.

1412
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It's just like over and over and over.

1413
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And so by the time you get there, it's really even though these weren't combat operations.

1414
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
You get, we learn a lot from them.

1415
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And there was a little adjustments we had to make for sure, but for the most part, what you learned how to do,

1416
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
what you learned how to do is you learned how to take a group of guys and get them to do something.

1417
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Right.

1418
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And when you learn how to do that, okay, that's then you, okay, you want to do this?

1419
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Cool.

1420
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I know how to take a group of guys and get them to do something.

1421
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It doesn't matter what that thing is.

1422
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I can get a group of guys to do something.

1423
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And that's what's beneficial.

1424
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
No.

1425
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That's what all that years of experience helps you out with.

1426
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
It doesn't necessarily help you.

1427
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I mean, it didn't help us with doing the specific mission.

1428
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
No, no, it can't cover everything.

1429
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I mean, at that point, I had three years as an instructor in Land Warfare.

1430
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And it was my eight ninth deployment.

1431
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
The light on.

1432
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I'd been, you know, eight potumes or whatever.

1433
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:22.000
It's not much more I was going to learn from another six months of training.

1434
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I mean, it's pretty much, I mean, there's no real thing I was going,

1435
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Wow, I've never done this before, you know, like, yeah, okay.

1436
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Yeah.

1437
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
All right.

1438
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.000
What was the most difficult thing you ever did as a seal when was the most fearful moment in your life?

1439
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Well, I get I sizzled and I tell you the truth,

1440
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I got nothing to do it.

1441
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
You know, the bombs and the wars and the killing and stuff.

1442
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It's like I never ever.

1443
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Battered and I skydiving or static climbing jumping into the water, jumping at night.

1444
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Never bothered me one bit.

1445
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
You know, not at all.

1446
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Never even was scared at all.

1447
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
But I don't like getting on the roof.

1448
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I mean, like I hate being a 40 foot ladder in a man lift.

1449
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
You know, I work for a landscaping company.

1450
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Sometimes we're up in the man lifts.

1451
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Man, this is kind of sucks.

1452
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
And I admit it, I'm a little bit afraid of heights at that level.

1453
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And repelling off a building one morning in Hong Kong, you know, like a 60 story building.

1454
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And we're repelling off and then going through a window and you got a training.

1455
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
You got to shoot these targets and stuff.

1456
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I mean, it's pretty cool, but I didn't like it at all.

1457
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And this morning it was windy and the buildings actually moving.

1458
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And I looked down, I'm going on a repell.

1459
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
You know, I'm edging over the side.

1460
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I'm not on the top of this building.

1461
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And the people look like raisins down there.

1462
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And I mean, I didn't even have to say, I mean, I got to go to the bathroom and I'm hung over.

1463
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And I was like, oh my God.

1464
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
But I'd rather die than be called a pussy.

1465
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I'm going to do it.

1466
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
No, but I'd rather die than be a pussy.

1467
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
That was pretty much the one I'll never forget that day.

1468
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
That was terrible.

1469
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
The most fearful moment.

1470
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
The most difficult thing you ever did is a seal.

1471
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Retire without a doubt, 100%.

1472
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Retire.

1473
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
And I'll leave it at that.

1474
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
There you go.

1475
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
All right.

1476
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Tony's favorite piece of kit.

1477
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And over Tony's career, what piece of gear has advanced the most.

1478
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Not including night vision, which obviously you've moved up to a bunch.

1479
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Well, I get to my favorite piece of gear kit.

1480
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
But evolution of gear.

1481
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
It's got to be, you know, there's a couple of things.

1482
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Like I say boots.

1483
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
The boot thing is phenomenal.

1484
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
We got such good gear and boots now.

1485
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Also you got to look in navigation.

1486
01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.000
You know, I remember the first GPS is we used to call him giant pieces of shit.

1487
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Because they were like the size of an ammo crate.

1488
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
They were huge.

1489
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
They were huge.

1490
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
They looked like a telephone from the Korean War, you know.

1491
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000
But nowadays they're just badass.

1492
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Yeah.

1493
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
You know, it would global positioning systems.

1494
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I mean, and also communications.

1495
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah.

1496
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I mean, your satellite communication is absolutely fantastic.

1497
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And everybody was in the military out there.

1498
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
When we had all the old kicks.

1499
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And Diana pads.

1500
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And if you remember that, we had HF high frequency.

1501
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
We did a lot of HF and stringing up antennas on the side.

1502
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Oh, my God.

1503
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
It was terrible.

1504
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Literally, yeah, literally stringing up 80 foot antennas.

1505
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
So you could make a communication shot to some other distant station.

1506
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Morris coat literally using Morris coat.

1507
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Oh, yeah.

1508
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Absolutely.

1509
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Good times.

1510
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:59.000
But my favorite piece of kit I would have to say is anything that you get in drive.

1511
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Because back in the day, we didn't, we didn't use any mobility.

1512
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
The thing was on foot and it was like, holy shit.

1513
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That and the the 300 windmags sniper rifles suppressed with a 22 power night force scope on it.

1514
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Is a wicked good piece of kit.

1515
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Let me tell you what.

1516
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I mean, I can read your t-shirt at a click.

1517
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
That's pretty good legit legit.

1518
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
All right.

1519
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Tony, what is the number one quality that allows a leader to lead men into unconfident

1520
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
conditions and succeed?

1521
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
What's uncomfortable?

1522
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I guess just bats and areas tough situations.

1523
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Well, I think keep it in your mind.

1524
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Mission men.

1525
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Mission men.

1526
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
What guys?

1527
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
You're not paid to sit here.

1528
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Here's what we got to do.

1529
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Let's go do it.

1530
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Yes.

1531
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
It sucks sometimes.

1532
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
It's bad.

1533
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
But mission men if you keep thinking that.

1534
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
That's what we're paid to do.

1535
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
The bottom line is you fall the orders of the guy above you.

1536
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And we're team guys.

1537
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
So that line bleeds a lot.

1538
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It has a lot of waves in it.

1539
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You know, because he'll be like, hey Tony, we think we're going to do.

1540
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I don't know, Jocca, let's do this.

1541
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
All right.

1542
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Sounds good.

1543
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
But at any given time, if he goes, hey Tony, this is what we're doing.

1544
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Roger that.

1545
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
And that's it.

1546
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Even if it means dying.

1547
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Because if you lead by example and you're humble and you're good to your guys and you know,

1548
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
you're guys and you know your guys and you let them know you.

1549
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
But you know, wipe their ass and you don't take any shit from them.

1550
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And they know you, they'll fall you.

1551
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You know, if you're humble and you make mistakes and admit it move on.

1552
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And I think that's, I know a few of my guys probably most of them would fall me,

1553
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
or whatever we want.

1554
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
You know, and I guess that's just because I never changed.

1555
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
They always knew what they're going to get from me.

1556
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
And it's about it.

1557
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Steady.

1558
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Yep.

1559
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Yeah, the other, the other big thing is making sure people understand why they're doing what they're doing.

1560
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Because like Tony just said, man, we, we're going to have discussions about stuff and say, hey,

1561
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
this is why, this is why, well, well, this is why I think we should do it this way.

1562
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
You know, it's not just like going to go and do.

1563
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Now, there are situations, of course, where someone goes, hey, going execute this now.

1564
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Hey, go hit that building. Hey, take guys over there.

1565
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
There's times in combat where you got to make those decisions and you got to make things happen.

1566
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
And that's when you talk, that's when that's when the important things that you just talked about.

1567
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Having a, just trust, right?

1568
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Like I, I just had trust in my guys.

1569
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
They trusted me that if I was telling them to do something,

1570
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
it was the right thing to do.

1571
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And by the way, if I told Tony, go take that building over there.

1572
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And he looked at me and said, negative, not now.

1573
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I knew he was saying that to me for a reason.

1574
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Yeah, all the shit.

1575
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I was in front of it.

1576
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Yeah, there was a reason why he was telling me that.

1577
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And we're not going to have that discussion.

1578
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Probably don't have time to do it right right now.

1579
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I'd say, okay, then we got to get out of here.

1580
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And you can, okay, Roger, Roger, and then we'd go.

1581
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So man, having that trust building up that trust through, you know, the humility, the relationship,

1582
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
all that stuff is, is how you end up with a tight unit.

1583
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.000
That's how you, that really, that's how you lead Tony.

1584
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Did you have the same attitude towards death as Jocco, were you prepared to die?

1585
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Was I prepared to die?

1586
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Yes, in a second.

1587
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
That's, get that old as right away.

1588
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I really didn't have an attitude to death except for, you know, making other people die,

1589
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
the bad guys.

1590
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Then I didn't care about them.

1591
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I didn't, I guess I dehumanized them in my mind.

1592
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
So it wouldn't bother me because they're just, they're not people.

1593
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
They're tired of it.

1594
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And you just whack them and that's it.

1595
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And I was, I was definitely prepared to die.

1596
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Am I, in fact, you know, I thought that would be like the end of my career.

1597
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Really kind of.

1598
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But I thought it would be the end of your career too.

1599
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I'm not a part of that.

1600
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
There was a couple guys in our task unit.

1601
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I was not scared.

1602
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000
There was a couple guys in our task unit that I, I did not think we're going to make it

1603
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000
because they were just like, I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to be giving a speech at his funeral

1604
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
because he's a fired up young kid that does not care about.

1605
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Yeah, like, just not the other way for those of you out there like,

1606
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000
oh, he like didn't do his job. He was like, oh, yeah, no, like, like just guys that were so,

1607
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
so fired up that, yeah.

1608
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And like even our guys that did get killed, there wasn't one of them where I thought,

1609
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:02.000
oh, he's, he wasn't ready for that.

1610
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Right. Yeah, he didn't.

1611
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Did he want, of course those guys didn't want it.

1612
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I would love to have him here.

1613
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000
They would love to be here, but at the moment of truth, they did what I,

1614
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
what I would think they would would have done. Right.

1615
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:21.000
None of them that I say, oh, it's a shame or or anything like that.

1616
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Because those guys had those attitudes of, they were there.

1617
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
They were, they loved their job.

1618
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
They loved doing their job.

1619
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
They believed in what they were doing.

1620
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And that, that's the way it was.

1621
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Absolutely.

1622
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
All right.

1623
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Tony's view on training mentoring integrating new guys into the little tube.

1624
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Yeah, I mean, I've been on the old peo side of that.

1625
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I've been on the, not new guy side of that.

1626
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I've been on the chief side of it.

1627
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And I usually told the guys, you know, you're on time be motivated

1628
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000
because it's fun.

1629
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
For those of you that think like the seal seems to me is a thousand times more than I thought it would be.

1630
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
It's a fucking blast.

1631
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It's the best thing ever.

1632
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
It's the best men's club in the world.

1633
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And, but like you said, you're trying to build these guys, have these guys build their own reputation.

1634
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
You know, confidence.

1635
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Nobody has any confidence in the first day at the team.

1636
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Nobody.

1637
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Try to still confidence in them and I used to tell, you know,

1638
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000
should be seen not heard, carry a pen and paper, be on time and shut the fuck up.

1639
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Nobody cares about any of your stories where you've from or no that's crap.

1640
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
You know, Saint Stripes.

1641
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Eventually that'll come out in a year.

1642
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
You know, so just ask questions.

1643
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
If you need to be on time, listen, do you job?

1644
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
And show the guys the right way to do things.

1645
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And if it's not the right way, you know,

1646
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
tell them how to know the difference.

1647
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Show them how to know.

1648
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Do what they did for me.

1649
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
You know, and they look and you look in their eyes and they're just like,

1650
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Roger, but no, you don't get it.

1651
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Show me what I just said.

1652
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Okay, just say you don't understand, you know.

1653
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
But that's about it.

1654
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Try to be, you know, fair with them, direct.

1655
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
That's about it.

1656
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Lead by example.

1657
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
One thing I want to say there is about,

1658
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
you know, talk about being steady.

1659
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
We had a situation one time.

1660
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I was, I was a tune chief and we were working hard,

1661
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
working hard, working hard, like going up tempo is through the roof.

1662
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000
The battle rhythm was shot to hell because it was just go, go, go, go, go, go.

1663
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And the guys were getting tired and stuff and we had a meeting about it.

1664
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
And I didn't say anything.

1665
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And like, if we can just slow down a little bit, you know,

1666
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I'm like, okay, I mean, what's your limit, bitch?

1667
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
You know, because sometimes you go, go, go like that.

1668
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Things get unsafe and you start making mistakes.

1669
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
But we hadn't really made any mistakes at that point.

1670
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And I said, put it in perspective at this time.

1671
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Like, doba, some of them guys, like 22, 23 years old.

1672
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
That was like 38.

1673
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And I go, I use the analogy, like, we used to say,

1674
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
you're only as fast as the slowest guy in your patrol.

1675
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Maybe the guy that's got more weight, caring, more equipment.

1676
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
So he sets the pace and I go, let me go.

1677
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
They'll agree with that and everyone's like, yeah, yeah.

1678
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Well, we'll take a break when the oldest guy here gets tired and that's me.

1679
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And I'm not tired.

1680
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Now, I've said, okay, Roger that. Go to work.

1681
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
They're just like, yeah.

1682
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Roger.

1683
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000
So hopefully some of the new guys learned something on that one.

1684
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Yeah.

1685
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Yeah, I know that about that.

1686
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000
It's leading from the front, you know.

1687
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Yep.

1688
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
No doubt about it.

1689
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
All right.

1690
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:28.000
How does one put the high of war behind him and his, and are you always searching for it still in other things?

1691
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Uh, by transition to civilian life, kind of,

1692
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
It's a little, I just don't like it.

1693
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I mean, it's, it's terrible.

1694
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Like there's no action.

1695
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.000
There's no, you know, going in, who didn't like going to work on a Monday morning?

1696
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Yeah.

1697
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
It was the best.

1698
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I mean, and, you know, and by the way, you went to work on Sunday.

1699
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
You went to work on Saturday.

1700
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Yeah.

1701
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Just every, oh, like some of the guys that team, oh, yeah.

1702
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So we can know we'll be at the team.

1703
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Right.

1704
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
We'll be working out.

1705
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
We're working on our gear.

1706
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
They're going to go out.

1707
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
They're going to wake up the next morning and do the same thing on Sunday.

1708
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And they're going to come in on Monday.

1709
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
That's what it is.

1710
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yeah.

1711
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Because who cares about what else are you going to do?

1712
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Yeah.

1713
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
What else are you going to do?

1714
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Like, oh, you go to your front.

1715
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Go with your friends.

1716
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
All my friends are in the team.

1717
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
So it gives you nothing.

1718
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
So that's it.

1719
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Go back to whatever failed relationship.

1720
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Yeah.

1721
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
So that can definitely be tricky.

1722
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Am I searching for another things?

1723
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Probably.

1724
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
You know, I don't know.

1725
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I don't.

1726
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
That's such a high question to put in perspective.

1727
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I mean, I live in New Hampshire now.

1728
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And I work 40 hours a week.

1729
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I do all right.

1730
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
But I don't.

1731
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
There's no, you know, the magic in my life is like gone.

1732
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I mean, that was, that was the magic to glue that helped me together as the teams.

1733
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:02.000
You know, I got some good families back there, you know, that helped me out, like,

1734
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
friends of mine, friends of my family.

1735
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And the Murphy's, you know, the Daniels, the downsis.

1736
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I mean, there's just, you know, if I don't get to people back home's name, I'm sorry,

1737
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.000
but, you know, I got really good friends that that tried to help me kind of, but they just have no idea, like,

1738
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
you know, there's one old team guy back there.

1739
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It's like from the 70s.

1740
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
You know, and I talked to him.

1741
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It's like Roger.

1742
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000
You know, then there's a Sergeant Major retired 30 meters back there.

1743
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
But it's a small town and it's like, my drink a lot.

1744
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And, you know, I work a lot too, so I'm kind of functioning that way, but there's no.

1745
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I don't know.

1746
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I guess I'm still looking for something, but it's just the high awards, just like, I don't know,

1747
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:56.000
it's, I think you could say it's the fucking best.

1748
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
It's like the best thing ever.

1749
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
You know, and once you get done with a big firefight, you're like, you want to go back and like,

1750
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
can we do that again and again and again?

1751
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
It's so much fun.

1752
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I mean, even, I mean, it's socks, it's hide, but it's, it's, it's great.

1753
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I mean, I would just, because if you think about, like, they say heroes, right?

1754
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Tell me the real heroes of them guys standing up post out there with minimal training that

1755
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
don't want to be there and still do their job.

1756
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And find American soldiers, sailors, Marines, you know, and whatever.

1757
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
For us, that's our profession, like, you know, that's like, we didn't even want to go home.

1758
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
It's like our blood and our guts, it's in our DNA.

1759
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
That's what we want to be.

1760
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:45.000
So, I mean, how do you, you don't just, you do all that stuff for all those years.

1761
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
There's going to be side effects.

1762
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
You know, there's going to be, I don't care.

1763
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I'm, you know, I'm not going to go, I don't go see accounts, learn nothing,

1764
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
because I think I'm strong enough that, you know, I can handle it.

1765
01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
But it's not easy.

1766
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
You know, it's like when people, when people always come up and they say, you know,

1767
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
thank you for serving.

1768
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
They always say that.

1769
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
And I, you know, I would say, hey, it was an honor to serve course.

1770
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
But what I really want to say, and sometimes if it's a deeper conversation,

1771
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I'm like, don't think me, I feel guilty because you do enough.

1772
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
So fun.

1773
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And like, you guys paid me to do this.

1774
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Like, what is doing your little kid?

1775
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
You know, I ran around the woods and played military stuff and, right, put camouflage,

1776
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
put coal, black cork on my face and put played with guns and beat shot BB guns.

1777
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
And that's what I did all the time as a kid.

1778
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000
And then I grew up and I turned 18 and then they started paying me money to do the same thing.

1779
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I know.

1780
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And then they said, oh, there's a bunch of bad guys.

1781
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
You go kill them.

1782
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Oh, okay.

1783
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
They will give you more money.

1784
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And then yeah, so, so people say thank you and it's sort of,

1785
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
it definitely makes you feel like damn, man, I got so lucky.

1786
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I, I enlisted in the military, I got so lucky because it was like, you know,

1787
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
it was like a, the square peg found the square hole basically.

1788
01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Right.

1789
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And that's what a lot of team guys are like, and that's why we're all of a sudden,

1790
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
they go, okay, you can't use that square hole anymore.

1791
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
They pull you out and there's a triangle there.

1792
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Yeah.

1793
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Yeah.

1794
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Yeah.

1795
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Yeah.

1796
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Yeah.

1797
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Yeah.

1798
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
No.

1799
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Yeah.

1800
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Yeah.

1801
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000
It's still true and they, the service to me, I went in when I was eight.

1802
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
I had less than one, I was 17, one, I was 18.

1803
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Got out when I was, what, 45, 44 or whatever.

1804
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And it never lied to me.

1805
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
They always paid me and they'll pay me if they rest in my life.

1806
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And everything they say was true.

1807
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Do this.

1808
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
They go over the moon, do this, bunch of bullshit.

1809
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Yeah.

1810
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
There's little things, but overall, you know, I didn't have to like,

1811
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
figure out, figure out like a woman and, you know,

1812
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000
it was all wishy, washy, about shit and stuff.

1813
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
You know, and all that's just part of whatever being a man and stuff.

1814
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
But they never lied to me.

1815
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
It was always just really, really good.

1816
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And it's a really life, it's not like that.

1817
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.000
I mean, I deal with people and for the most part, everybody out there is a good person, I believe.

1818
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
But I get mad because of the misuse of the military now.

1819
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I mean, it's so misuse, it's crazy.

1820
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Grab 200,000 badass army soldiers and Marines.

1821
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Go over to where ISIS is and smoke these sons of bitches.

1822
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
What are we waiting for?

1823
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I don't get it because, but on the flip coin, people are like,

1824
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
we get to pay the deficit because we don't want our children to pay it.

1825
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Yeah, but you want them to fight the war?

1826
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Let's go. We got the muscle right now.

1827
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I don't know where we're waiting for.

1828
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
This is a crock shit.

1829
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Hopefully that'll change.

1830
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Yeah, hopefully we'll change.

1831
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
You know what, do one more question here.

1832
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:54.000
How do you keep your head in the game when one of your squad is killed?

1833
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Yeah.

1834
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
You know?

1835
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Well, I think for me, you have to treat it like mission men in that order.

1836
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And to me, there's no use, you know, the milk is on the floor.

1837
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
There's no use crying over it.

1838
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000
You know, EOD doesn't, you know, defuse a bomb that already went off.

1839
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Okay.

1840
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
What you gotta do is try not to lose any more of your men.

1841
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Okay.

1842
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Now you just gotta do the mission with the dead guy.

1843
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000
And I know that sounds maybe cruel, so there ain't no time to sit there and mourn

1844
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
or do any of that.

1845
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
You have to complete your op.

1846
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
You have to do your mission.

1847
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
All right.

1848
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
There's plenty of time to mourn.

1849
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
There's plenty of time to figure out what and wrong.

1850
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Or what didn't go wrong or whatever happened when you're back at the op stun.

1851
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And that's why we train like that.

1852
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
When we train and we go through a building and they put a guy down.

1853
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
You just step over and clear the house because you don't like it.

1854
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000
You know, more than one killed.

1855
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
You just have to do what you've been trained to do.

1856
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
And in the leadership position, it's very hard not to.

1857
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
You know, you can train all your life, but when something happens like that,

1858
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
it's very hard not to just go, oh my god, I've got somebody killed.

1859
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
You know what happened when I happened?

1860
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Because I take it very personally because it was one of my guys.

1861
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
And I racked my brain for a long time.

1862
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000
And then I figured out that, well, you know, I just gotta do my job and be a leader.

1863
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
You know, and I can't let the rest of you guys down.

1864
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
And I can't let myself down on my team and my country.

1865
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
So I gotta do what I gotta do to get out of there.

1866
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I'm not get out of there, but complete the op and then figure it out.

1867
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Then take care of it as best we can and have a lot of respect.

1868
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And that's about best way I can answer that, bro.

1869
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Yeah, you know, I remember after Mark got killed.

1870
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
And he was obviously was the first seal killed in Iraq.

1871
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
He's the first guy that ever worked for me that got killed.

1872
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And I remember a couple days when buy we actually did the memorial ceremony.

1873
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000
In like a couple days when buy.

1874
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.000
And I was kind of trying to figure out what to say to the Patoons.

1875
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Specifically what to say to your Patoon.

1876
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Right.

1877
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And I was sort of, and I realized what I was doing, right?

1878
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000
When I was doing was the only thing I knew how to do, which is work.

1879
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Yep.

1880
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And finally, I remember I was, that's what I wrote down.

1881
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:41.000
I'm like, look, Mark came into your Patoon.

1882
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:49.000
And I said, hey, Mark is the best mother fucker ever.

1883
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Yeah, he was.

1884
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
And my fucking soul is crushed right now.

1885
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
And actually remember as I was talking,

1886
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I started getting emotional.

1887
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000
And I stopped.

1888
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
And I was getting a little choked up.

1889
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
And I stopped talking.

1890
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And I was just trying to get it together.

1891
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
And you were sitting there.

1892
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
And you're like, hey, man, it's okay.

1893
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Yep.

1894
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
And I was like, check.

1895
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
This is what I'm going to do.

1896
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I'm going to work.

1897
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Yep.

1898
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
And this is what we're going to do.

1899
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
We're going to work.

1900
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000
You know, when that happened, I was thinking about that.

1901
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I, I never, ever once, shed one tear.

1902
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And I started getting like concerned, like, do I have anything,

1903
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
like, feelings at all?

1904
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And then we came back from that deployment.

1905
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
I remember maybe, I don't know, six months later,

1906
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
something.

1907
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000
It may not sound like, may shock you, but I used to like cats.

1908
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
They used to like cats, you know?

1909
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
You always seem like a cat guy.

1910
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I like dogs, too.

1911
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
You know, like just me and my girlfriend at the time, I cat.

1912
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
And my cat died.

1913
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And I bought like a little baby for like three hours.

1914
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I just, I think it was just a point me waiting for to come out.

1915
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.000
You know, I want to be like, okay, because your team guy around that stuff all the time.

1916
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
People getting maimed, shot, killed, and blown up.

1917
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
You know, and then it kind of fester than that.

1918
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I think, you know, it's kind of deep and stuff, but whatever.

1919
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I'm not really that deep of a person.

1920
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And it just came out and I was like, you know, that's kind of cool.

1921
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Yeah.

1922
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000
So maybe I was just, you know, I took the like behind thing a little too too much for my boy.

1923
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:54.000
But, well, I think that's about all we've got for tonight.

1924
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.000
And thanks, everybody, for asking those questions.

1925
01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Tony, you got me.

1926
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Got anything else you want to say?

1927
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Any closing comments?

1928
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:10.000
No, I just shot out to all my, my chums and, uh, my brothers and the teams and, you know, all the people that know me, my family and everybody.

1929
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
And, uh, thanks for being so nice to me.

1930
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:20.000
And the teams, thanks for being so nice to me and letting me do all those wicked, cool things, you know.

1931
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
And, uh, Jocco, thanks for having me.

1932
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
It's so good to see you, my brother.

1933
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Oh, echo.

1934
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Pleasure.

1935
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Thank you.

1936
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I mean, just just phenomenal, you know.

1937
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
You don't know how many people watch your show.

1938
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Watch this.

1939
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Well, what fires me up the most is, uh, obviously the military guys and the team guys and, uh, team guys that are, you know, our bros.

1940
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
That are like, hey, man, that was great.

1941
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Oh, yeah.

1942
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I learned and that just gets me, uh, that's why I'm doing this, man.

1943
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Yeah.

1944
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
That's why I'm doing this.

1945
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:58.000
And yeah, that's what means the most to me and having you on here obviously is, uh, is phenomenal.

1946
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:03.000
So, um, everybody that is out here that's listening to this.

1947
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Thanks for listening to the podcast.

1948
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Thanks for supporting it.

1949
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
If you do want to support the podcast a little bit.

1950
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
That's what I'm talking about.

1951
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Echo Charles.

1952
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Tell them quickly how to do it.

1953
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Actually, it's like actually I do have one more question.

1954
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Go ahead, man.

1955
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Um, you know, okay, you're like a hard guy and I just put real simply and it's might be kind of an ambiguous question.

1956
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000
But like that example, you say, it was real hot and you're not even drinking water.

1957
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
You're drinking coffee and Copenhagen.

1958
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Yeah.

1959
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Okay.

1960
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Example.

1961
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Like, why is that?

1962
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
You know, because it's a spectrum, right?

1963
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Like, a lot of people, like some people, they can be big, well, they can run, you know,

1964
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.000
10 miles, no problem all this stuff, but they get in certain kind of discomfort physically or whatever they're done.

1965
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Or you get these big guys or whatever.

1966
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
They miss one meal they're done.

1967
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Right.

1968
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Right.

1969
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
They're throw buds.

1970
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Yeah.

1971
01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:02.000
So you're like, I was, I was probably that crew in the teams like this fight and drank a lot.

1972
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And so that kind of trained us like being hung over and stuff like, I mean, we would be like,

1973
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
hung over and go work and you work out for three hours.

1974
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Yeah.

1975
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
So these guys, I know guys, like, they could never do that.

1976
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Right.

1977
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
So we're kind of like bottom feeders.

1978
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
So on shit, got bad.

1979
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
We're like, whatever.

1980
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Yeah.

1981
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I'll, I'll make it.

1982
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
But I'm not like that anymore.

1983
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Like, I work.

1984
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I need to drink water because I'm not used to it.

1985
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Yeah.

1986
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I would, there was some kind of a genetic component.

1987
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Like, like, like, I, I freely admit, like, I don't sleep a lot, right?

1988
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And I understand that it's not just because like, I'm just tough.

1989
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000
It's because there's some genetic component in there that doesn't require a lot of sleep.

1990
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
And you know, I have one of my, I've told this before.

1991
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Like, one of my daughters, I'll go to bed at like 1130.

1992
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
She'll be awake and then I wake up at 430 morning and she'll be awake.

1993
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Like, she's genetically, she doesn't need a lot of sleep.

1994
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
So I know I'm kind of like that too.

1995
01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And there's just, just FYI for Tony, there's something genetic about the water intake.

1996
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Because I mean, I did patrols and stuff with you.

1997
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And, you know, I mean, I'm fairly hard, but I need water.

1998
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
You know, I would need to carry more water than you.

1999
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:18.000
And, you know, never, never would I be like a bitch about it, like, but no.

2000
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000
You know, I, I, I, I would need, like, twice as much water as Tony would need.

2001
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
And I don't wait twice as much.

2002
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
I mean, I'm whatever.

2003
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I might be 40 pounds heavier or something like that.

2004
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.000
But so there's some genetic component that makes you need less water and makes me need a decent amount of water.

2005
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000
So, again, also I spent a lot of time at Nylon.

2006
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Yeah, yeah, for sure you're activated to, I'm not like that now.

2007
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
I need a lot of water.

2008
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000
But even even overall above and beyond just the water situation where,

2009
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
and you're like this tool that we're kind of talking about this where, do you think that,

2010
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
you know, like if you just sit around indoors and after all, you're like,

2011
01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
bro, I gotta get out.

2012
01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Oh, yeah.

2013
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
A lot of people that I like that, the opposite.

2014
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
There's like, dang, there's a lot going on outside.

2015
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000
They're better stained doors.

2016
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Yeah.

2017
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Even big tough strong guys.

2018
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
A lot of people are like that.

2019
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Is it, and does, does this kind of fallen line with why you took to the team so,

2020
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
y'all, that's already absolutely echo.

2021
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
No, because you're like that too.

2022
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Well, yeah, and I'll tell you again, going back to give credit where credits do man.

2023
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
The people that we were raised by the same people the teams.

2024
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And those guys, they didn't complain about anything.

2025
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
They showed no weakness ever, ever.

2026
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
The ever, nothing.

2027
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Yeah.

2028
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Like, oh, your tire, you never hear a guy say it was tired ever.

2029
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Never, no, no.

2030
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
You know, hurt doesn't matter.

2031
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Broken something?

2032
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
No, just be quiet.

2033
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Put tape on it.

2034
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Yeah, shut up.

2035
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Yeah, and that's, and so when you're brought up that way,

2036
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
and I mean, it was blatantly obvious when you got the team.

2037
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Oh, yeah.

2038
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Like if you, you just, no, there was no, no,

2039
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
you don't complain about anything. Just be, just suck it up.

2040
01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Oh, this sucks.

2041
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Yeah, don't even admit that it sucks.

2042
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Don't ever do that.

2043
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Yeah, and that's be quiet.

2044
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
That's, that's probably the best way to explain it.

2045
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Yeah.

2046
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Yeah.

2047
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
That, and like, I didn't have anything else put that.

2048
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Like I said, I wasn't the best shooter.

2049
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I wasn't the biggest guy, but I had that.

2050
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I always had that.

2051
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I remember one time we were training.

2052
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
And you know how, like, after around this done,

2053
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
like a lot of people, and I was one of those people.

2054
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
You just, you just flop on your back and lay down and get your S.

2055
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Yeah, week one to, yeah, I broke one time.

2056
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Long time, we'll take your eyes off your enemy.

2057
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
That was more or less than attitude.

2058
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
He was like, you look a little tired.

2059
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000
They're almost like, it was when you first kind of started coaching me up a lot.

2060
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Yeah.

2061
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And you were like, you look a little tired there, but it wasn't a joke.

2062
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000
It was kind of like, as if you really wanted to say,

2063
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Bro, don't do that.

2064
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Right there.

2065
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Like stand up walk.

2066
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Don't, you're like showing weakness.

2067
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Like how you do that.

2068
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
That was really the tone.

2069
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
That was, so that makes a lot of sense right there.

2070
01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:00.000
But that being said, I think it goes, I feel like it goes a little bit above and beyond.

2071
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Just having a skill or being really good at being able to tolerate pain.

2072
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
I feel like just like how you were saying, I think, you know, a few weeks ago, you were like,

2073
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
There is, there is a word for it.

2074
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I want some a little bit of pain to show on my life kind of thing.

2075
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Right, absolutely.

2076
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:20.000
But like in our case, I think it could be counter, counter guys is that we are,

2077
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
We're lunatics.

2078
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Yeah, like massive because who wants who, you know,

2079
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
What's this being a frog, man, for 20?

2080
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Yeah, I mean, that's just, but so hard on your body.

2081
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Yeah, yeah.

2082
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000
But we are lucky.

2083
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Yeah, and lucky.

2084
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
But like I like Tim Ferrell who you talked about earlier,

2085
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I mean, all the guys that we talked about, Mr. Fakimine.

2086
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Yeah, how old, when he, when he, when he, we were coming up on the team,

2087
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:50.000
He was 46, 47 years old. He was all broken. Yeah.

2088
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Broken knees, broken ankles. Guess what, out there on a six and a half mile run.

2089
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Yeah, every single time.

2090
01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And what were the complaints?

2091
01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
None.

2092
01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
None ever.

2093
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Just crush everyone and just be, actually like, like Mr. Fakimine,

2094
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
He wouldn't crush people on the run, but you'd see him hobbling.

2095
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Yeah.

2096
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Across the finish line.

2097
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
And you'd be like, that had to hurt so bad.

2098
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
But he just, whatever, you know, put a little tape on it.

2099
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Well, I, I, I, I, I, I felt a lot of a helicopter and broke my heel bone on Halloween day.

2100
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Yeah.

2101
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And I deployed and, well, actually I went over before I went to play.

2102
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
So I deployed in March.

2103
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Yeah, I got, I got a hammer and I cut my cast off with these bolt cutters.

2104
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
And that wasn't a good idea.

2105
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Yeah.

2106
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
And I remember the master chief of the command.

2107
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
He'd, he'd, he'd, he'd say, he wanted to make sure I was good to go to go over and see.

2108
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So I'd be walking down the hallway night seeing my walk perfect.

2109
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Yeah, I had to live.

2110
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
And it hurt so bad.

2111
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
You're saying you're doing a stand-up shoot to shoot with him for a minute.

2112
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Good, good Roger.

2113
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
All right.

2114
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Hey, I got to go.

2115
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Going to bathroom, you're going to head and go,

2116
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Oh, my God.

2117
02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I mean, I was still hobbling when we deployed.

2118
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Yeah.

2119
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
It just, it just kind of went away.

2120
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.000
He's no way.

2121
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I was missing that.

2122
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
No way.

2123
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Wait.

2124
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I think most of us are like that.

2125
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Maybe to begin with, but maybe taught like out of it.

2126
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Because you know, I mean, even in everyday person, if they, they do something kind of hard

2127
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000
or work out or even, you know, something like people will recreation and be like,

2128
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
I think going around a marathon or something like that.

2129
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000
So when they do something hard or kind of painful, some kind of adversity and it's done,

2130
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
you feel good.

2131
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I think that's a natural thing.

2132
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Oh, like people like, like look, my cool scar, you know, that kind of thing.

2133
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.000
But it kind of feels like and kind of listening stuff from as an outsider a little bit here.

2134
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.000
It kind of seems like those shackles of kind of being trained out of that just didn't happen

2135
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
for you guys.

2136
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
And guys like you, you know, oh yeah.

2137
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Maybe we got trained in the other way.

2138
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Well, yeah.

2139
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Or I think you, you guys just held onto it.

2140
02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Absolutely.

2141
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Like it just, yeah.

2142
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Yeah, there's, there's no doubt.

2143
02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
And there's a bunch of, bunch of badass frogmen that are in the team.

2144
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Yeah, that's all.

2145
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And you know, you know, you can go talk to the Marines, army soldiers, tough bastards.

2146
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Okay, not so. Okay. So when when he's living here, we're rolling.

2147
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
What's that thing that caught?

2148
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Let's like this syndrome when you just work out.

2149
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Oh, yeah.

2150
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
It's like beyond,

2151
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Rab, Rabdo, Rabdo my losses.

2152
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Yeah.

2153
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
So he gets that by the way.

2154
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
And he, um, it's just from his wrong.

2155
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
His best friend growing up to two, two of his best friends growing up our team.

2156
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I'll tell you they are later.

2157
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Oh, nice.

2158
02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000
So he's, we're rolling you just so he's like going every day of just all day.

2159
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
He's like, we're just doing the, and he's not, he's kind of quiet.

2160
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
He's like, oh, we're all done. We've been done hard day.

2161
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Then like, you know, the guys who showed up later, whatever they're still kind of like, hey, you want all kicked out of the ladies.

2162
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Okay.

2163
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Like that. So he never says no.

2164
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
The next week.

2165
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Like I guess they have to go to the doctor, whatever the next week, he's like, yeah, you have that.

2166
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Rabdo, like, have you been doing a lot of physical output?

2167
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
You know, this is he's like, yeah, he's just been freaking, I know.

2168
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
But that's exactly what I'm saying.

2169
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000
But, but normally that stops a guy in his tracks wall their training and he's just like, no, just keep training.

2170
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Oh, someone else wants to train.

2171
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I mean, I remember one time he said, I call him kind of tired.

2172
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
I mean, he said that, but he didn't say, I'm done rolling.

2173
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
He didn't say like, you looked tired.

2174
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Oh, but then, then.

2175
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Yeah.

2176
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Awesome.

2177
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:19.000
That's what I think.

2178
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Awesome.

2179
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
All right.

2180
02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Any other questions from echo Charles?

2181
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
No, that's it.

2182
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
We can, we can go to support.

2183
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Support, you know, let's wrap it up. How can they support?

2184
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
If you want to support, this is how you can.

2185
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
You know, we talk about getting after it a lot from time to time.

2186
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Oh.

2187
02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000
And supplementation is not a formal weakness with your agree tone.

2188
02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I would agree.

2189
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Right. Supplement, right?

2190
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Best supplements because now the supplements can be kind of whack on it.

2191
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Fortunately, someone on Twitter was asking me about a,

2192
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
a chewing tech, a shrimp tech like, Oh, how does it work? You know, this is a thing.

2193
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000
This is, I know that it helps, or I've heard, from credible source.

2194
02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
That it helps with oxygen utilization.

2195
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So, you know, like high intensity that kind of goes prolonged to whatever,

2196
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
but you can read on it on the website,

2197
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
they have all the, like, the actual literature.

2198
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Like the test and all this stuff, but on all the stuff.

2199
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Anyway, so, it's legit.

2200
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
We all know it's legit.

2201
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
I think that's kind of common knowledge by now.

2202
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.000
You can get 10% off if you want supplements on it.

2203
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:21.80
Doc on slash.

2204
02:04:21.80 --> 02:04:22.80
Jocco.

2205
02:04:22.80 --> 02:04:23.30
Let's go slash.

2206
02:04:23.30 --> 02:04:27.30
Jocco.

2207
02:04:27.30 --> 02:04:29.10
Get a worry bar as well.

2208
02:04:29.10 --> 02:04:30.80
My suggestion.

2209
02:04:30.80 --> 02:04:33.30
Not a good stuff on there.

2210
02:04:33.30 --> 02:04:35.30
Next way.

2211
02:04:35.30 --> 02:04:36.30
Amazon.

2212
02:04:36.30 --> 02:04:41.50
So if you shop on Amazon, like we all do, click through the website, our website.

2213
02:04:41.50 --> 02:04:46.30
JoccoPodcast.com is a little linked there, a little banner on the side.

2214
02:04:46.30 --> 02:04:50.20
And go through Amazon or go to Amazon through there.

2215
02:04:50.20 --> 02:04:56.000
And of course, subscribe to the podcast on iTunes and YouTube.

2216
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.44
Do more videos to come by the way.

2217
02:04:58.44 --> 02:05:01.18
And of course, Jocco store.

2218
02:05:01.18 --> 02:05:04.90
If you like any shirts that we have, we did it.

2219
02:05:04.90 --> 02:05:12.38
I think we expanded a lot of mental energy, making sure that the shirts are good to go.

2220
02:05:12.38 --> 02:05:13.38
As they say.

2221
02:05:13.38 --> 02:05:15.38
Or as you would say, kind of dope.

2222
02:05:15.38 --> 02:05:20.94
Yeah, but don't meaning not just either don't because we said so we try to put different

2223
02:05:20.94 --> 02:05:21.94
layers on them.

2224
02:05:21.94 --> 02:05:26.54
You know, it's not like it just says, hey, I'm cool or I don't know, whatever.

2225
02:05:26.54 --> 02:05:30.14
It says something and then there it means something as well.

2226
02:05:30.14 --> 02:05:31.14
Right.

2227
02:05:31.14 --> 02:05:32.54
Where if you don't know what it means, you just don't know.

2228
02:05:32.54 --> 02:05:35.18
That's one layer you don't know about it.

2229
02:05:35.18 --> 02:05:37.06
This one has a couple layers sometimes three.

2230
02:05:37.06 --> 02:05:38.66
Just saying they're not just normal.

2231
02:05:38.66 --> 02:05:40.06
And if their quality is well.

2232
02:05:40.06 --> 02:05:41.46
Just saying they're good.

2233
02:05:41.46 --> 02:05:45.06
Anyway, you can judge for yourself as far as how they look.

2234
02:05:45.06 --> 02:05:46.06
Joccostore.com.

2235
02:05:46.06 --> 02:05:47.94
If you like, I'm going to get a shirt.

2236
02:05:47.94 --> 02:05:48.94
Support that way.

2237
02:05:48.94 --> 02:05:50.94
Or a mug or a sticker.

2238
02:05:50.94 --> 02:05:51.94
Whatever.

2239
02:05:51.94 --> 02:05:52.94
Or a rashguard.

2240
02:05:52.94 --> 02:05:53.94
Or rashguard.

2241
02:05:53.94 --> 02:05:54.94
Yes.

2242
02:05:54.94 --> 02:05:55.94
So new things.

2243
02:05:55.94 --> 02:05:56.94
R rashguard.

2244
02:05:56.94 --> 02:05:59.46
If you didn't know already, rashguards are good.

2245
02:05:59.46 --> 02:06:05.70
Biking, diving, swimming, surfing, bodyboarding, crossfit.

2246
02:06:05.70 --> 02:06:09.02
Any kind of Olympic lifting where you need mobility is, it's actually better than cotton

2247
02:06:09.02 --> 02:06:10.02
shirts.

2248
02:06:10.02 --> 02:06:12.58
They, like, you know what I mean?

2249
02:06:12.58 --> 02:06:14.38
And you just do.

2250
02:06:14.38 --> 02:06:15.38
But not Lee.

2251
02:06:15.38 --> 02:06:16.38
The jujitsu.

2252
02:06:16.38 --> 02:06:17.38
Andy did good.

2253
02:06:17.38 --> 02:06:18.94
And today, Andy, one is fine.

2254
02:06:18.94 --> 02:06:19.94
Big end.

2255
02:06:19.94 --> 02:06:20.94
Big end of work.

2256
02:06:20.94 --> 02:06:21.94
Representing.

2257
02:06:21.94 --> 02:06:22.94
It wasn't a super fight.

2258
02:06:22.94 --> 02:06:23.94
It was a bracket, by the way.

2259
02:06:23.94 --> 02:06:25.62
Oh, I thought it was a pretty little bit.

2260
02:06:25.62 --> 02:06:26.62
Decision.

2261
02:06:26.62 --> 02:06:27.62
He'll hook.

2262
02:06:27.62 --> 02:06:28.62
Dang.

2263
02:06:28.62 --> 02:06:29.90
Andy representing.

2264
02:06:29.90 --> 02:06:32.42
And yeah, he did, in fact, have true brachka.

2265
02:06:32.42 --> 02:06:38.46
See what we were talking about the 17, well, the 17, 19% improvement in your performance.

2266
02:06:38.46 --> 02:06:39.46
Yeah.

2267
02:06:39.46 --> 02:06:44.34
And in my, uh, bro science, like, opinion, I think that applies to all physical.

2268
02:06:44.34 --> 02:06:45.34
I can't even do it.

2269
02:06:45.34 --> 02:06:46.34
You wear this rash card.

2270
02:06:46.34 --> 02:06:47.34
I'm, I'm a believer.

2271
02:06:47.34 --> 02:06:52.10
And for those of you that don't know, uh, echo Charles does have a doctorate in

2272
02:06:52.10 --> 02:06:53.10
bro science.

2273
02:06:53.10 --> 02:06:54.10
Yeah.

2274
02:06:54.10 --> 02:06:56.46
I'm working on it.

2275
02:06:56.46 --> 02:06:57.46
And, um, okay.

2276
02:06:57.46 --> 02:06:58.46
So new stuff.

2277
02:06:58.46 --> 02:06:59.46
Also we have patches.

2278
02:06:59.46 --> 02:07:01.74
I have Velcro, Velcro ones.

2279
02:07:01.74 --> 02:07:02.74
You know, like this guy.

2280
02:07:02.74 --> 02:07:03.74
Hey, Tonya.

2281
02:07:03.74 --> 02:07:06.14
Oh, and then women's stuff as well.

2282
02:07:06.14 --> 02:07:07.14
They're tank tops.

2283
02:07:07.14 --> 02:07:08.14
Okay.

2284
02:07:08.14 --> 02:07:09.14
I got you.

2285
02:07:09.14 --> 02:07:10.14
We're going to do t-shirts as well.

2286
02:07:10.14 --> 02:07:11.14
Thank you, Lisa.

2287
02:07:11.14 --> 02:07:12.14
For the, um.

2288
02:07:12.14 --> 02:07:14.14
The Nudge, you know.

2289
02:07:14.14 --> 02:07:16.98
And then, um, yeah, there it is.

2290
02:07:16.98 --> 02:07:17.98
That's the stuff.

2291
02:07:17.98 --> 02:07:19.30
Maybe some more, some more cool stuff.

2292
02:07:19.30 --> 02:07:20.74
You know, the seasons are changing.

2293
02:07:20.74 --> 02:07:22.90
So we'll put some more stuff on there for you guys.

2294
02:07:22.90 --> 02:07:23.90
It's cold.

2295
02:07:23.90 --> 02:07:24.90
Need some warm gear.

2296
02:07:24.90 --> 02:07:25.90
Potentially.

2297
02:07:25.90 --> 02:07:26.90
Let's get it done.

2298
02:07:26.90 --> 02:07:27.90
Yeah.

2299
02:07:27.90 --> 02:07:28.90
But there it is.

2300
02:07:28.90 --> 02:07:29.90
Yeah.

2301
02:07:29.90 --> 02:07:30.90
Support it.

2302
02:07:30.90 --> 02:07:32.30
And thanks for everyone with the, the who has supported.

2303
02:07:32.30 --> 02:07:37.30
If you want to get some of this goodness right here, a little bit of, uh, pomegranate

2304
02:07:37.30 --> 02:07:43.30
white tea available on Amazon.com, jockel white tea.

2305
02:07:43.30 --> 02:07:47.58
The only thing I drink other than water and milk.

2306
02:07:47.58 --> 02:07:49.22
So jump on the train.

2307
02:07:49.22 --> 02:07:53.22
Also, if you haven't got a copy of extreme ownership yet, which me, my brother, late

2308
02:07:53.22 --> 02:07:56.66
babbin wrote, which has a ton of Tony who you heard from tonight.

2309
02:07:56.66 --> 02:08:00.10
A ton of Tony in there anytime you're hearing about the Charlie Potoon G for Charlie

2310
02:08:00.10 --> 02:08:01.58
Potoon, New and as a truck.

2311
02:08:01.58 --> 02:08:05.18
That's the guy we've run in it and it makes it happen.

2312
02:08:05.18 --> 02:08:09.82
You can put up the hard copy, digital copy or the audio book in the life and I actually read

2313
02:08:09.82 --> 02:08:16.66
in October 20th and 21st in San Diego, California, if you're a leader or you want to be

2314
02:08:16.66 --> 02:08:20.54
a leader, come on out to the extreme ownership.

2315
02:08:20.54 --> 02:08:25.70
Muster, we're going to teach the principles of combat leadership and we're going to get

2316
02:08:25.70 --> 02:08:30.38
in the weeds on the tactics of how to actually employ them.

2317
02:08:30.38 --> 02:08:34.90
There's one thing to know on, but you got to know how to employ them on the battlefield

2318
02:08:34.90 --> 02:08:40.82
on the street in the business world or in life.

2319
02:08:40.82 --> 02:08:44.86
So register and then come and get it.

2320
02:08:44.86 --> 02:08:51.02
And as always, if you want to keep kicking it with us, echo Charles and myself, we're all

2321
02:08:51.02 --> 02:08:53.86
up on the interwebs.

2322
02:08:53.86 --> 02:08:59.38
Twitter, Instagram and that face bookie.

2323
02:08:59.38 --> 02:09:01.02
Echo Charles is at echo Charles.

2324
02:09:01.02 --> 02:09:06.26
I'm at Jakah Willink.

2325
02:09:06.26 --> 02:09:08.50
I don't think Tony has any of that stuff.

2326
02:09:08.50 --> 02:09:10.50
No, I don't do this.

2327
02:09:10.50 --> 02:09:12.06
It's a BTF in the time for it.

2328
02:09:12.06 --> 02:09:14.34
BTF.com.

2329
02:09:14.34 --> 02:09:15.34
Yeah.

2330
02:09:15.34 --> 02:09:17.62
Just don't contact me.com.

2331
02:09:17.62 --> 02:09:26.76
And to all the motivated troopers out there, especially first off, those in uniform, military,

2332
02:09:26.76 --> 02:09:32.20
law enforcement firefighters, EMTs, thanks for what you all do.

2333
02:09:32.20 --> 02:09:38.72
Thanks for working hard for training hard for living hard and for fighting hard and for holding

2334
02:09:38.72 --> 02:09:41.52
the line.

2335
02:09:41.52 --> 02:09:49.08
And the rest of you folks out there, the rest of you troopers in the workforce attacking your

2336
02:09:49.08 --> 02:09:56.72
daily struggles, smashing obstacles, keep doing what you're doing and doing it with

2337
02:09:56.72 --> 02:10:01.56
focus and some ferocity.

2338
02:10:01.56 --> 02:10:05.60
And finally, to Tony.

2339
02:10:05.60 --> 02:10:08.68
Thanks again, my brother for coming on the show.

2340
02:10:08.68 --> 02:10:15.68
Thanks for the years you put in training, fighting and leading.

2341
02:10:15.68 --> 02:10:18.60
Thanks for always being there to support me.

2342
02:10:18.60 --> 02:10:21.28
No matter what.

2343
02:10:21.28 --> 02:10:24.28
No matter what.

2344
02:10:24.28 --> 02:10:26.40
Yes, sir.

2345
02:10:26.40 --> 02:10:31.64
Thanks for what you did for me for the task unit, for the teams, for the Navy and for the

2346
02:10:31.64 --> 02:10:34.88
United States of America.

2347
02:10:34.88 --> 02:10:42.96
And you know, Tony is one of the many veterans from every war who remains in the shadows,

2348
02:10:42.96 --> 02:10:54.52
who seeks no glory, who did what he did as his duty for country and for his brothers

2349
02:10:54.52 --> 02:10:58.36
on his left and now on his right.

2350
02:10:58.36 --> 02:11:09.12
So to all of you veterans like Tony, the true quiet professionals, thanks to you warriors

2351
02:11:09.12 --> 02:11:19.72
who have set the example of how to serve and of course, how to get after it.

2352
02:11:19.72 --> 02:11:31.000
So until next time, this is echo and jockel and the original BTF.

2353
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.48
Tony is ready.

2354
02:11:32.48 --> 02:11:33.48
Thanks, brother.

2355
02:11:33.48 --> 02:11:55.88
Dido – no, he said, check Roger.

2356
02:11:55.88 --> 02:11:56.92
Roger.
