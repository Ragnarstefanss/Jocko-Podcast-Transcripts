00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000 This is Jockelbontcast number 304 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I go.
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000 Good evening. Also Jonas tonight, Dave Burke, good evening, Dave.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000 Good evening. We're going to continue our review of the book on the psychology of military incompetence.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000 We started that on the last podcast, 303.
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000 Believe it or not, we only got through the forward and the preface and two chapters.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000 So this one could take a while, but there's a reason.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000 There's a reason I've been sitting on this book for a while. There's a reason I'm doing this podcast right now.
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000 And so today we're going to get through some of the first part of the meat of the book, which is the historical examples.
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000 And these historical examples are what get referred back to throughout this entire book.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000 So each one of these, each one of these situations that we're going to talk about, they're broken into chapters in most cases, not 100%.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000 But these are disastrous military engagements, engagements or battles or campaigns or wars.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000 And each one of these events could be an entire book.
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000 And that means they could be each event could be a podcast or two or three.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000 And some of them have been, you'll notice some of them that we'll talk about.
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000 We have done podcasts on because they're significant military events.
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000 Some of them, I'm sure, will come back and visit in the future.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000 And I'm going to move, I'm trying to give enough information in from each one of these events.
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000 So that when he refers back to these events later, you get it.
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000 Because if you don't have the context, then you won't understand the references that he's making.
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000 So I'll try and condense the historical examples a little bit, but it's rough.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000 And some of them are really obvious, for instance, the section on like World War I, considering what World War I is.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000 It's relatively short.
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000 Why? Because most of us know the basic history of World War I, same thing with World War II.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000 But then he gives more specific examples inside of each of those and outside of those wars that are definitely more detailed.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000 And the this section of the book starts with an epic example of incompetence and tragedy.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.000 It is about the Crimean War, including the famous or infamous, depending on who read you the story, charge of the light brigade.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:00.000 So this war was fought between October 1853 and February 1856, between Russia on one side, who eventually lost to an alliance of France, the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain and Sardinia.
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000 And so we're going to get into it in the book.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:21.000 The Crimean War certainly marked an exceedingly low point in British military history. The poor quality of the officers, most of whom had bought their commissions and for whom no standard of education was required.
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:38.000 Stood and marked contrast to the excellence of the men described by one observer as the finest soldiers I ever saw in stature, physique and appearance. So right out of the gate, we don't like this scenario. How do you get to be in a leadership position? You pay money.
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000 That's how you get to be in a leadership position. Your dad is a rich whatever.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:03.000 And so you're a spoiled punk ass kid and your dad wants you to have some cloud in the world. So he says, oh, I'm going to buy you a commission. And by the way, the more money he has, the more rank you get savage amongst, but yeah, he's also saying that the men were squared away.
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:26.000 Amongst the officers, there seemed to be an inverse relationship between rank and efficiency. The more senior they were, the less competent they appeared at the apex of this pyramid of mediocrity stood or rather sat for he was always on his horse or in his quarters and being in order to leave shy rarely walked amongst his men, Lord Raglan.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000 His qualifications for leading a British expeditionary force appear to have been his age. 67.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000 His lineage used the youngest of Duke of Bufurt's 11 sons and his experience 25 years as military secretary to the Duke of Wellington.
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.000 And then master general of ordinance. No one would accuse him of having a mind cluttered by any previous experience of command for he had none, not even of a company.
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:11.000 So this guy, Raglan, which is a bummer because Raglan is a name of an awesome surf spot in New Zealand. It's also a name of one of my favorite restaurants in San Diego, which is named after the surf spot, not after not after Lord, not after the Lord.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000 Lord Raglan, Raglan OB shout out.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:35.000 His appointment, however, was not wholly inappropriate for of him. It was said his chief merit was that despite his incurable habit throughout the campaign of referring to the enemy as the French, which by the way, the enemy was the Russians and and the French were on his side.
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000 He was admittedly and admirably adapted to less in the friction in coalition wars. So this is a guy that was sort of, you know, easy to get along with.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000 Right. Oh, you got a bunch of people. We got the French. We got the Sardinians. We got the Ottoman Empire.
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000 We got England. Let's put somebody in charge of kind of can make friends. So that's his admirable quality.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000 In fact, Raglan seemed to agree with the with most French proposals. It was a characteristic of the man that he hated conflict.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000 There's so many weird things in all these different personalities. It is just.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000 You know, it was on EF online today or sorry, extreme ownership academy today and a somebody brought up one of those personality tests.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000 So he was saying, you know, we had a company off site and we did this personality test and it made me start thinking about, hey, when I'm interacting with someone else.
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000 I need to think about what type of personality they have.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.000 And try and relate things in a way that will best land on their personality. And I said, yes, absolutely. And then on top of that.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.000 I had 78 other items, who is this person? What's the personality type? Sure. What's their experience? What's their background? What kind of day are they having today? What's their what's their position in the organization?
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000 What's my relationship with them? Because what we're dealing with when you're dealing with other human beings is that that thing that we talked about on the underground podcast, which is.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000 We're all insane because we all see the world a little bit differently. So when I'm relating to Dave, I can't just think, oh, it's just I need to relate to his personality.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:32.000 But how does he feel about this project? What's his passion level? What's his experience? How much does he know? Has he had bad experience with this department that he's going to go take charge of all those things you have to think about when you're going into these situations dealing with other human beings?
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000 So disaster.
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000 Yeah, we say, we say leadership's a human nature and never all the time.
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000 And this idea of even just contemplating how the other person is going to react is a huge step in the right direction.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000 So it's shocking how many people, you know, that's really what you, that's really what you get when you get the young Eric's inexperience leader.
00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000 They're seeing everything just through their own eyes and everyone just, what is wrong with everyone. Oh, I'll tell you what's wrong. They're humans.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000 Yeah.
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000 Fast forward a little bit.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:18.000 Jacqueline and his staff constitute the nerve center of the army in the Crimea. The sinuse compromise a field force of five infantry and two cavalry divisions under commanders who for the most part did little to inspire confidence.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000 Here to the problem was partly one of age.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000 Apart from the 35 year old Duke of Cambridge cousin to the Queen, all the senior commanders would be between 60 and 70.
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000 With Sir John Bergoyne, chief engineer, topping the list at 72.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000 Certainly it could be said of them that what they lacked in experience they made up for years.
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:55.000 So am I in am I committing ages and right now by saying, hey, if you're 72 and you're in a war that's taking place in 1853,
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000 maybe you're not in the best to help, and maybe you shouldn't be running a war.
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000 Check.
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:14.000 As I think a lot of times in these wars back in the day, like if you're a British lord or whatever, this is just going to check the box, right?
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000 Oh, you can go out and kill some natives and be a hero for the king or for the crown, right?
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000 Some of that is definitely going on.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.000 As has so often been the case, the next lower level of command did contain some leaders of vigor with a well talent for war, such one was Sir Colin Campbell.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000 His command, unfortunately, was no larger than a brigade.
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000 As usual in those days, the cream of the crop of the army was the cavalry commanded, in this instance, by Lord Luke in,
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000 an impulsive man of moderate intellect and lacking experience.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000 There you go.
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000 Let's go to the good way to start.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000 Directly under Luke in, in charge of the heavy and light brigades, respectively, were James Scarlet and Lord Cardigan.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:16.000 The arrangement was not a happy one to select Cardigan for a position subservient to his brother-in-law, Luke in, was hardly less delicious than subordinating a mongous to his snake.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000 So you have these two relatives that hate each other and one's been put in charge of the other.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000 Lord Luke has been put in charge of Lord Cardigan.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000 Fast forward a little bit.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:44.000 The prime characteristic of Lord Raglan, his almost compulsive non-participation, aristocratic, courteous and aloof, he seemed to display many of the characteristics of the extreme introvert.
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000 So distasteful, was it to have any direct contact with his fellow men that he could hardly bear to issue an order?
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:02.000 And when he did so, it was couched in such a way to ensure a vast gulf between his wishes and the comprehension of those for whom it was intended.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000 Think about that.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000 You're giving orders that basically make no sense.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000 It's insanity.
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000 It's the opposite of simple clear and concise.
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:28.000 This first battle was won by England, but it was not exactly, it didn't exactly go the way they wanted it to.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000 That battle was at Alma, despite the fact that Raglan watching from afar played little part and bringing about Alma was a victory for the allies.
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000 Thanks to the courage and superb fighting qualities of the soldiers and their junior officers.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:54.000 Through what one observer described as a great want of general ship, the victory was achieved with much unnecessary loss of life, even worse, and even worse, because of a total failure to follow it up,
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000 yielded few if any dividends for the campaign as a whole.
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000 So they were able to win the battle, this first battle, only because the soldiers and the junior officers were freaking square away and brave.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:19.000 And that's a thing that you get throughout these, but throughout this book is the bravery of the soldiers is undeniable, but they get put in situations that are just disastrous.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000 There is one final point of some relevance to the thesis of this book. It concerns the matter of initiative.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:37.000 The idea of direction from those at the apex of a hierarchical authoritarian organization provides a special dilemma for those at lower levels in the chain of command.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000 Confunded with the absence of clear cut orders, what are they to do? So you're in a hardcore hierarchy and there's no clear cut orders. What are you supposed to do?
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000 If they take the lawn to their own hands, they run the risk of being accused of the insubordination, particularly if their plans happen to miscarry.
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:10.000 But if they do not show initiative, then they are equally likely to suffer for not having done so at all the field officers for want of higher direction use their own initiative with considerable success and doing so they save the day of not the campaign.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000 This is what we set up in organizations when we're micro managing people.
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000 And all of a sudden you can't get the word out. What if what are people supposed to do?
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000 If you've trained them to get micro managed, they're not going to do anything.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000 Fast forward a little bit trouble started in dividing command between the two generals Lord Luke and Lord Cardigan already mentioned them.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000 Individually neither was fitted to his post together. They were disaster.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000 That's one of their fellow officers wrote in his diary, the more I see of Lord Luke and Lord Cardigan, the more I thoroughly despise them.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000 Such crass ignorance and such overbearing temper.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000 Raghland did not excel in dealing with these men.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000 Instead of loyally supporting Luke and he appeared to condone even the most flagrant accesses of the incorrigible Cardigan.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000 So he's got the senior officer, which is Luke and instead of like, okay, you know what?
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000 You're just going to support the chain of command here.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000 Instead he sort of lets Cardigan run wild as well.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000 Not only did he allow Cardigan to bring his private yacht into Bala-Klava, where for weeks it took up valuable space in the congested harbor,
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:34.000 but he also permitted him to live on board even while his brigade and divisional commander were roughing it ashore on rations under canvas.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000 I like how Dave was just closing his eyes and shaking his head throughout this.
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000 By forefitting his position of authority and exacerbating the already bitter enmity between his subordinates,
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000 Raghland's las a fair handling of these relatively minor matters, so the sees of the ultimate disaster, the destruction of the light brigade.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:07.000 So look, we've heard some crazy stuff, but when your troops and your leadership and your subordinate leadership are living off rations,
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000 intense and you're in a freaking yacht in the harbor.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000 You can't make that up dude.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000 That is a level of crazy that you almost couldn't believe.
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000 And we were hearing stories about like they would bring pianos and like, you know, grandma phones and stuff like,
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000 wow, that's pretty excessive.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000 And now you got my, I need my personal yacht in the harbor and I'm going to live on it.
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000 Yeah.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000 Man, that's rough.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000 I've even been on a yacht before.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000 Not like a real yacht.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.000 No.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000 Echo Charles?
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000 Yes, sir.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000 I've been on a yacht.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000 And let's just say it's not exactly rough.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000 Oh, yes, sir.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000 Very crazy.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Fast forward a little bit.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000 For behind the color and the glory behind the valor and the dash, the charge of the
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:10.000 gear was a blunder of monumental proportions and an at object lesson in what can happen when the promotional machinery of a military organization is such as to put troops at the mercy of men like
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000 Raglan, Luka and Cartagoon.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000 And there's a book actually, Leipzig wants to cover this book on on the podcast, the charge of the lip or date.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000 But you get into the details of these.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000 It's, it's insane.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000 It's totally insane.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000 Here's a little, a little brief of it.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.40 of the explanation of this curious lapse hinges upon the fact that Luke and had a press
00:16:29.40 --> 00:16:34.12 upon Cardigan that his job was to stay put and defend the position, attacking only such
00:16:34.12 --> 00:16:38.92 enemy forces as came within reach. Under the circumstances, Cardigan determined that he would not
00:16:38.92 --> 00:16:43.48 give his brother-in-law the slightest grounds for making a complaint should the attack fail.
00:16:43.48 --> 00:16:48.28 If it did, then Luke and should take the blame. Luke and in order came to defend the position
00:16:48.28 --> 00:16:50.92 and defend it, he would even if it cost him his life.
00:16:50.92 --> 00:17:01.000 If, haven't I said before, some people, they would rather die than let their ego get offended.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.12 Here's a classic example. It seems that the charge of the light brigade from which only 15%
00:17:08.12 --> 00:17:15.16 of the original force of 673 roadback was the end result of faulty communication between five men.
00:17:15.16 --> 00:17:21.40 Five men, Raglin, his quarter-master general, Erie, Lord's Luke and Cardigan and the impetuous
00:17:21.40 --> 00:17:26.84 captain Nolan, Raglin's contribution is that he issued orders the precise meaning of which
00:17:26.84 --> 00:17:33.56 has remained a matter for debate. The fourth and more disastrous of these orders, Erie wrote out on a
00:17:33.56 --> 00:17:39.32 flimsy piece of paper in doing so. He made no attempt to unravel the enigma posed by the words of his
00:17:39.32 --> 00:17:48.28 master. Trying to see if they have this in here. Raglin says cavalry to advance and take advantage
00:17:48.28 --> 00:17:52.76 of any opportunity to cover the heights they will be supported by the impetry which have been ordered
00:17:52.76 --> 00:18:00.92 to advance on two fronts. That is the vagus to vehicle, or straight there. As they're trying
00:18:00.92 --> 00:18:05.80 to sort through this witch front, what guns in its new written form, the order was then passed to
00:18:05.80 --> 00:18:14.04 the unbalanced captain Nolan who loathed both Luke and Cardigan. This glittering young officer
00:18:14.04 --> 00:18:20.60 of the 15th who SARS who made up in arrogance, what he lacked in, personality, delivered the order
00:18:20.60 --> 00:18:26.68 to Lord Luke and Luke and whose comprehension of Raglin's wishes seems to have been minimal,
00:18:26.68 --> 00:18:31.96 but who is not going to demean himself by bandying words with Nolan conveyed his interpretation of
00:18:31.96 --> 00:18:36.68 the order to Cardigan. This is like the telephone game you play when you're a kid. Cardigan
00:18:36.68 --> 00:18:42.44 with a bunch of ego. Cardigan, to give him his due, realizing that he was being asked to charge the
00:18:42.44 --> 00:18:48.68 Russian guns down a valley flanked by artillery, expressed considerable astonishment at what would
00:18:48.68 --> 00:18:55.16 so evidently be the coup de Graf for his brigade. But once again, communication foundered on the
00:18:55.16 --> 00:19:02.12 rocks of mutual dislike, pride and jealousy, joined and then overtaken by the irrepressible Nolan,
00:19:02.12 --> 00:19:15.80 Cardigan led his brigade into the jaws of death. There's a little section here on a portioning
00:19:15.80 --> 00:19:24.20 of the blame. Like what do you do? And he says this and it's a very interesting thing to be talking
00:19:24.20 --> 00:19:31.16 about in this book because well, you'll see, it's a very sad feature of authoritarian organizations
00:19:31.16 --> 00:19:37.40 that their nature inevitably militates against the possibility of learning from experience
00:19:37.40 --> 00:19:44.28 through the apportioning of blame. So these these authoritarian organizations can't learn
00:19:44.84 --> 00:19:49.96 from mistakes because they just blame each other. This is extreme, the opposite of extreme ownership.
00:19:49.96 --> 00:19:54.68 This is extreme dis-ownership. The reason is not hard to find since authoritarianism itself
00:19:54.68 --> 00:20:01.24 is the product of psychological defensives, defenses, authoritarian organizations are past masters
00:20:01.24 --> 00:20:09.48 at deflecting blame. They do so by denial, by rationalization, by making scapegoats, or by
00:20:09.48 --> 00:20:18.20 some mixture of the three, wow. This is why the book Extreme Ownership has hit a mark
00:20:18.20 --> 00:20:25.96 because it's the opposite of this. Denial rationalization, making scapegoats, or by some
00:20:25.96 --> 00:20:31.88 mixture of the three. However, it is achieved, the net result is that no real admission of failure
00:20:31.88 --> 00:20:38.28 or incompetences ever made by those who are really responsible. Hence, nothing can be done
00:20:38.28 --> 00:20:45.40 about preventing a reoccurrence. In this instance, as many others to be considered presently,
00:20:45.40 --> 00:20:49.24 scapegoats were found, one of them was Captain Nolan, an easy choice since he had very
00:20:49.24 --> 00:20:59.16 considerally allowed himself to be killed. You can't make this up. You can't make this up the fact
00:20:59.16 --> 00:21:06.20 that the book Extreme Ownership, and the concept of extreme ownership, is literally the opposite
00:21:06.20 --> 00:21:13.08 of the psychopathology of bad leadership. And the people, even in the, you know, I did a TED talk
00:21:13.08 --> 00:21:17.96 about extreme ownership and sort of part of that is no one takes ownership of the problems,
00:21:17.96 --> 00:21:22.36 and therefore the problems don't get solved. That's what this just said in more words,
00:21:22.36 --> 00:21:33.64 because no doctor Nixon is smarter than I am. Not the only problem. Another thing going on.
00:21:33.64 --> 00:21:39.80 I mean, meaning the charge of the light brigade was not the only bad situation that unfolded
00:21:39.80 --> 00:21:46.44 in the Crimean War. The Crimean mismanagement reached its apathy, not in the battle so far considered,
00:21:46.44 --> 00:21:50.84 but in the winter. And by the way, I'm skipping some battles. He gives more detail. Not in the
00:21:50.84 --> 00:21:56.04 battle so considered, but in the winter, which followed them. Despite the fact that between October
00:21:56.04 --> 00:22:03.80 1854 and April 1855, there was no fighting whatsoever. Ragland's army suffered a 35% decline in
00:22:03.80 --> 00:22:09.48 its active strength. This loss would due to a total disregard for the army's physical welfare
00:22:09.48 --> 00:22:16.12 and refusal to ameliorate the cold and wet of a Russian winter. Men died of cholera, exposure,
00:22:16.12 --> 00:22:22.44 malnutrition. They died of untreated wounds of scurvy gangrene and dysentery. As one surgeon
00:22:22.44 --> 00:22:29.24 observed at the early losses at Bala Klava, we now bury three times the number of men every week
00:22:29.24 --> 00:22:34.44 and think nothing of it. And that's not from combat. That's just from people dying.
00:22:39.32 --> 00:22:44.60 According to one writer, what killed more men than Russian bullets? What made life miserable? What
00:22:44.60 --> 00:22:49.48 sent men in the hundreds to the hospital tent or the grave? They were frequently synonymous.
00:22:49.48 --> 00:22:54.28 Was a want to firewood. Without it, not only were men never warm, not only could they never
00:22:54.28 --> 00:22:59.48 cook their ration of cold grunter, but they were never dry. One of Ragland's kernels wrote,
00:22:59.48 --> 00:23:03.88 they go down to the trenches wet, come back wet, go into the hospital, wet, die the same night
00:23:03.88 --> 00:23:08.44 and are buried in the wet blankets the next morning. At an army surgeon wrote,
00:23:08.44 --> 00:23:12.28 I never thought the human subject would endure so much privation and suffering.
00:23:15.80 --> 00:23:20.68 And we have to remember, this is when freaking England is a superpower. This isn't like
00:23:20.68 --> 00:23:28.84 some rag tag military unit. What's exposure? You die of it. Like cold. Be they're cold. Hot.
00:23:30.04 --> 00:23:34.68 If you're out in the Tundra, the freezing Tundra you die of being too cold. That's exposure.
00:23:34.68 --> 00:23:39.96 If you're out in the desert, you're exposed to heat. You can die of that. The elements in general.
00:23:39.96 --> 00:23:46.20 Hellenic in general. You probably wouldn't know about that grown-up and Hawaii.
00:23:46.20 --> 00:23:51.16 No, it's because you're not going to die from exposure. No, I'm pretty cool. Sleep in exposure.
00:23:51.16 --> 00:23:57.80 Oh, hey. So good. Back to the book. Eventually after a winter of terrible
00:23:57.80 --> 00:24:02.28 privation, Ragland's army came to the last battles of the war, those of reddened.
00:24:03.64 --> 00:24:07.64 They involved the storming in capture of a fortress on the outskirts of Sebastopol.
00:24:08.04 --> 00:24:12.44 It seems that little had been learned. Again, there was gross underestimation of
00:24:12.44 --> 00:24:16.76 enemy's ability. Indeed, the forthcoming engagement was regarded with such an
00:24:16.76 --> 00:24:20.04 equanimity that it attracted a large assembly of sightseers.
00:24:23.08 --> 00:24:28.04 When the band of the rifle brigade played light music and audience of officers wives,
00:24:28.04 --> 00:24:32.44 traveling gentlemen, and even a number of serving soldiers took up position on surrounding hills.
00:24:33.72 --> 00:24:40.04 Ragland with his mind closed to all that had gone on before and in during overconfidence in
00:24:40.04 --> 00:24:47.72 his army chose only 400 of his 25,000 men for the first stage of the battle.
00:24:47.72 --> 00:24:52.60 The occupation of some quarries from which the assault on redden would be mounted.
00:24:52.60 --> 00:24:57.24 This proud economy in manfowler was his first mistake. So you have 25,000 people
00:24:57.24 --> 00:25:01.88 and you're going to use 400 of them. And by the way, there's people. There's a band playing,
00:25:01.88 --> 00:25:05.88 I don't even know what kind of music they're playing. What do you say, light, spirited music?
00:25:05.88 --> 00:25:13.08 If you're going into combat and you're not listening to a Metallica, you shouldn't bring a band.
00:25:16.92 --> 00:25:22.28 Ragland staff miscalculated the strength needed to occupy the quarries and to repel counterattacks
00:25:22.28 --> 00:25:26.28 reserves had been inadequate and unavailable when most needed little thought had been given to
00:25:26.28 --> 00:25:30.36 the selecting a troops to be used. The proportion of veterans was low. Many of the officers
00:25:30.36 --> 00:25:35.32 although unquestionably brave or young and inexperienced, but it was with the second stage of the
00:25:35.32 --> 00:25:40.12 battle, the main assault that things went really wrong. Again, Ragland and other high-ranking
00:25:40.12 --> 00:25:45.08 officers underestimated enemy strength and overestimated the effects of artillery bombardment
00:25:45.08 --> 00:25:52.12 with which the he preceded the attack. Nor did he appreciate that between the bombardment of
00:25:52.12 --> 00:25:56.84 the Russian fort and the dawn attacked forced upon him by the French commander. The enemy would
00:25:56.84 --> 00:26:03.16 well be able to repair their defenses and their guns. So you need to see the stakes are just
00:26:03.16 --> 00:26:09.96 piling up. Under the circumstances it was hardly surprising that the great volume of fire
00:26:09.96 --> 00:26:15.88 from the Russian guns brought the British attack to a very bloody halt. It was at this moment
00:26:15.88 --> 00:26:19.56 just when it was most needed that Ragland's artillery received in order to cease fire.
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:26.36 It was this last plunder which transformed and aborted attack into a massacre, no longer intimidated
00:26:26.36 --> 00:26:32.36 enemy muskets poured a hail of lead into Ragland's stricken army. The latter parties moving like
00:26:32.36 --> 00:26:38.44 snails beneath their load were moaned down as they struggled up the slope. Thus ended the first battle
00:26:38.44 --> 00:26:45.32 for Redan until the most until then the most disastrous of the war. Ragland's army had no illusions
00:26:45.32 --> 00:26:49.48 as to the incompetence of their general and his staff. A staff officer wrote,
00:26:49.48 --> 00:26:54.28 we had been told from headquarters and other high authority that success was certain.
00:26:54.60 --> 00:26:59.88 That the arrangements for the plan of attack were so perfect that they must succeed.
00:26:59.88 --> 00:27:06.04 When they put to the test they turned out to be so excrabbly bad that failure was inevitable.
00:27:07.56 --> 00:27:10.76 Others described the battle as mismanaged, blotched, bungled,
00:27:12.12 --> 00:27:17.000 feeble, and ill-conducted bad business, a bungling disgraceful childless failure.
00:27:23.16 --> 00:27:29.64 Later Lord Wolosley wrote, upon this occasion what we asked from them was beyond the power of
00:27:29.64 --> 00:27:34.20 men to give our plan for the attack was simply idiotic and was bound to fail.
00:27:34.20 --> 00:27:40.04 Another writer has this to say, not only was it a question of defective tactics. At headquarters,
00:27:40.04 --> 00:27:46.44 there was merely ignorance, not merely ignorance, but an entire lack of vision. How was it possible
00:27:46.44 --> 00:27:52.20 that Ragland and those about him knowing as they ought by this time the remarkable Russian ability
00:27:52.20 --> 00:27:57.56 to repair damage overnight could believe that 2000 soldiers would be able to advance over a shell,
00:27:57.56 --> 00:28:04.68 swept glaciers, 250 yards in length, thread their way through an undistroid habitus,
00:28:04.68 --> 00:28:09.64 cross a ditch 20 foot wide and then a sale and a apartment without preliminary bombardment.
00:28:15.48 --> 00:28:22.44 Do I mean, can you even fathom that sort of operational planning? You have to find you have to think
00:28:22.44 --> 00:28:30.60 this is no thought. I'll be honest with you, I'm having a hard time listening to this
00:28:30.60 --> 00:28:42.28 and trying to even capture the the the criminal portion of this. I'm trying to get in my head like
00:28:42.28 --> 00:28:47.16 what is the most critical lesson from this of all these things that you keep piling on top of
00:28:47.16 --> 00:28:57.16 each other, but all these insane things. And there's a part of me that that finds it unbelievable.
00:28:57.16 --> 00:29:00.76 Like I am literally having a hard time believing this happened, knowing that it did.
00:29:02.60 --> 00:29:06.68 Of something I think is probably the biggest lesson in leadership and something you articulate
00:29:06.68 --> 00:29:11.56 to people all the time, which is you actually have to care about your people more than yourself.
00:29:11.56 --> 00:29:20.20 That that fundamental belief, not a tactic, not a like a tool, but the belief that your people
00:29:21.48 --> 00:29:26.84 matter more than yourself. And we see that people struggle with that, we see people struggle with that.
00:29:26.84 --> 00:29:31.16 We do and we try to help them and and there's an ego and there's selflessness and there's
00:29:31.16 --> 00:29:37.48 some natural tendency we have to fight against, but the depth, the gulf between that idea and this
00:29:37.48 --> 00:29:46.76 is so far apart that it's really hard to appreciate how, how little the perception is that the
00:29:46.76 --> 00:29:53.08 things that you're talking about aren't things, they're people, like human beings on your team.
00:29:53.88 --> 00:29:58.76 And hearing it is it's hard to comprehend how do you get so disconnected, you know, though the
00:29:58.76 --> 00:30:05.16 yacht was like sort of a funny little bit like sad story, but we all know the we I know it's coming.
00:30:05.16 --> 00:30:09.96 I know what the outcome is, so the culmination of that is how inconceivable it could be and then how
00:30:09.96 --> 00:30:13.88 there's a lesson inside there of if you don't care about the people around you, you're not going to
00:30:13.88 --> 00:30:20.04 listen to them and how far you can get from that. I mean this isn't this isn't a thousand years ago.
00:30:21.40 --> 00:30:27.64 Yeah, yeah, the like there's a billion different, the last section I read it's like,
00:30:27.64 --> 00:30:29.88 oh a tactical problem tactical problem tactical problem, tactical problem,
00:30:29.88 --> 00:30:36.44 we get that there's some tactical and people make tactical mistakes, how the question is how
00:30:36.44 --> 00:30:42.20 do you make all these tactical mistakes the answer is leadership, all your problems are leadership
00:30:42.20 --> 00:30:49.000 problem and the solution is leadership, the solution to problems is leadership and you end up with
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.52 people that are bad leaders in these situations, they make bad decisions and things fall apart.
00:30:54.52 --> 00:31:01.88 And the other thing we have to think about too because this is a very it's a military thing,
00:31:01.88 --> 00:31:10.52 it's a military idea, but there's the men and there's the mission, right? And there's a priority
00:31:11.56 --> 00:31:15.80 sometimes people say well you know the mission is the most important thing. The reality is
00:31:17.48 --> 00:31:23.88 that's actually not true. If you prioritize the mission over the men you won't have any men left
00:31:23.88 --> 00:31:30.60 and you won't be able to execute any missions. So they're mutually supporting things that need to be
00:31:31.32 --> 00:31:38.44 both that both need to be addressed and taking care of. Yeah, if now look can you do can you get a
00:31:38.44 --> 00:31:44.12 mission where hey Dave you're going to take your assault team in and you're taking out this
00:31:45.48 --> 00:31:51.40 air defense node in North Korea and Jocco's team is going to take out the other defense node and
00:31:51.40 --> 00:31:57.96 Ecos team is going and if we don't take out these three defense nodes we can't like we're not going to
00:31:57.96 --> 00:32:01.64 strategically achieve this objective then it's like okay look we're going to be
00:32:01.64 --> 00:32:05.56 we're going to be taking some casualties and look at DDA that's what we did look at the Pacific Island
00:32:05.56 --> 00:32:12.52 campaign that's what people did but to look at a situation like this where there's about 10,000
00:32:12.52 --> 00:32:19.48 other ways to execute this mission is insane. Yeah and if and if and if you're going through that
00:32:19.48 --> 00:32:24.20 sort of mental arm wrestling over the men or the mission or the people and the mission the only way you
00:32:24.20 --> 00:32:29.000 actually get people to be willing to do that mission is for them to know that you care about them
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.40 more than yourself and and that's too that's your point is you're not even saying the mission is
00:32:35.40 --> 00:32:41.000 as important as the people in like in a hierarchy you're saying that if you actually want to be
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.04 able to accomplish the most difficult things the most difficult missions missions that almost appear
00:32:46.04 --> 00:32:50.36 unwinnable if you actually want to be able to do that which of course we do we're here to solve
00:32:50.36 --> 00:32:54.36 solve the problem we're here to complete the mission is to have people willing to do that
00:32:55.08 --> 00:33:00.76 and the only way to do that is for them to go oh they've actually cares about me more than just
00:33:00.76 --> 00:33:03.56 getting the check in the block that he knocked this thing out or took care of this one thing
00:33:03.56 --> 00:33:07.24 or got this mission solves we can tell us boss yeah mission accomplished and and you actually have
00:33:07.24 --> 00:33:13.64 a better chance of doing things that by right almost appear to be impossible. Yeah the the
00:33:13.64 --> 00:33:18.60 culture that you have inside your organization you can have a culture inside your organization where
00:33:18.60 --> 00:33:24.68 people are going to be willing to sacrifice their lives for your team right and if you look at
00:33:24.68 --> 00:33:31.40 this time period with the brits the Victorian the honor the glory the I mean when you know
00:33:31.40 --> 00:33:37.56 at the beginning phases of World War one when they would when they would if there was if you
00:33:37.56 --> 00:33:43.24 were a military aged male and you weren't in the military the women would give you the the white
00:33:43.24 --> 00:33:50.68 flower which meant you were a coward and so people like okay well where do I sign up right
00:33:50.68 --> 00:33:55.56 and that was kind of the deal um look at the look at the Japanese in World War two now
00:33:55.56 --> 00:33:59.88 were those guys what's this kamikaze pilot brainwashed well not even just brainwashed but
00:33:59.88 --> 00:34:05.24 what do they regret for again some cases they were but also they were committed culturally to
00:34:05.24 --> 00:34:14.04 this overarching thing here's the problem with that in both those cases if you as a leader
00:34:14.04 --> 00:34:21.16 continue to sacrifice people without making the progress you you end up having to say uh this isn't
00:34:21.16 --> 00:34:26.68 working out and the people will look at you and say wait a second we we tried this this isn't working
00:34:26.68 --> 00:34:37.64 the even if you got a different plan or we're not gonna do what you tell us to do um continuing
00:34:37.64 --> 00:34:42.52 on here for the student of the psychosomatic disease the aftermath of the battle is not without
00:34:42.52 --> 00:34:50.04 significance immediately following the defeat raglin will see seem to age visibly within a few days
00:34:50.04 --> 00:34:56.52 he had contracted cholera and before ten days had passed he was dead two his generals were similar
00:34:56.52 --> 00:35:03.32 similarly stricken raglin's demise added to the depression of the army had they known that his
00:35:03.32 --> 00:35:10.84 replacement would be 63-year-old general Simpson their grief might have been more acute it's not that
00:35:10.84 --> 00:35:18.28 Simpson was a harsh task masker master on the contrary he was a gentle old man but a very mediocre
00:35:18.28 --> 00:35:24.60 ability he was as devoid of useful experience as had been his predecessor his methods were
00:35:24.60 --> 00:35:30.12 rather simpler be than those of raglins presumably to avoid giving a wrong order he gave no orders
00:35:30.12 --> 00:35:36.20 at all and he devised no plan in the words of one observer he did not command the army
00:35:37.08 --> 00:35:42.12 on the day of his promotion he is credited with saying they must indeed be hard up when they
00:35:42.12 --> 00:35:49.48 appointed an old man like me how about you say no and by the way if the boss doesn't come up with a plan
00:35:49.48 --> 00:35:56.76 come up with one in fact the government was not so hard up as they had to entrust the army to this
00:35:56.76 --> 00:36:03.000 gout ridden old general a far better choice would have been the energetic and outspoken sur
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.44 call in a camel a man of considerable ability and wide experience but cambal was a maverick
00:36:09.48 --> 00:36:15.56 and as such was unpopular with the military establishment he also came from a relatively humble background
00:36:15.56 --> 00:36:21.08 so instead of taking the freaking georgest pattern of the crew you take this loser
00:36:22.52 --> 00:36:29.96 under simsons quivering and in effect we'll hand the second battle for redden the last battle
00:36:29.96 --> 00:36:35.08 of the war proved even more disastrous than the first once again a massive bombardment was
00:36:35.08 --> 00:36:39.72 followed by a frontal assault across a heavily devoured defended triangle of ground flanked by
00:36:39.72 --> 00:36:46.68 Russian guns but this time the troops were younger and greener and despite all their training on the parade
00:36:46.68 --> 00:36:56.04 grounds of alder shot less inclined to valor than discretion having sustained 2447 casualties
00:36:56.04 --> 00:37:02.28 in two hours of fighting they turned tail and fled thus adding humiliation to defeat so that's
00:37:02.28 --> 00:37:08.84 what I was just talking about let y'all hey we're willing to sacrifice but there's a line yeah
00:37:11.24 --> 00:37:14.36 2,447 casualties in two hours of fighting
00:37:17.56 --> 00:37:21.96 as an example of protracted military incompetence at a high level of command the cream
00:37:21.96 --> 00:37:29.32 commune war is not unfortunately unique it was however the prototype for subsequent ineptitude
00:37:29.32 --> 00:37:35.40 those small number in comparison with those of later wars the 18,000 who died owed their ultimate
00:37:35.40 --> 00:37:43.16 their untimely demise to end and mixture of poor planning unclear orders lack of intelligence
00:37:43.88 --> 00:37:49.48 in both senses of the word and fatal acquiescence to social pressures on the part of their
00:37:49.48 --> 00:37:53.80 commander that's a very interesting topic social pressures
00:37:53.80 --> 00:38:00.36 we see a lot of that going on in this current time in the military
00:38:01.40 --> 00:38:07.56 social and political pressures on war fighting units who have a job which is to fight
00:38:10.68 --> 00:38:15.000 they died because they were mismanaged by men whose positions in the military hierarchy
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.12 owed less to their ability than to their wealth their place in society or their reputation for
00:38:20.12 --> 00:38:27.40 quote fitting in they died because soldiers were too readily regarded as expendable objects
00:38:29.32 --> 00:38:35.96 the crummy and wars the crummy and war was fought at a time of the greatest prosperity this
00:38:35.96 --> 00:38:40.12 country had ever known when British efficiency inventiveness and sheer entrepreneurial
00:38:40.12 --> 00:38:44.52 vigor knew no bounce as I said earlier this isn't like a rag tag crew
00:38:44.52 --> 00:38:50.60 why then was it fought so badly so badly that the casual observer might have been
00:38:50.60 --> 00:38:54.04 forgiving for thinking that at some level we did not really want to let win
00:38:56.04 --> 00:39:01.000 of course there are some obvious and immediate reasons governmental stinging is clearly played
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.68 apart as did the deliberate policy of entrusting military matters to the
00:39:06.68 --> 00:39:12.12 to enter aristocratic rich but essentially amateur elite this on the grounds that such a
00:39:12.12 --> 00:39:17.56 class would need that would have neither the motivation nor indeed the skill to turn upon the state
00:39:19.32 --> 00:39:24.12 but this is only to touch the surface of the problem such reasons do not explain the
00:39:24.12 --> 00:39:29.64 passivity and non-participation the monumental errors of judgment the ludicrous appointments
00:39:29.64 --> 00:39:35.48 the paralytic ability to improvise or innovate they do not explain the staggering and ultimately
00:39:35.48 --> 00:39:41.24 self-destroying wastage of manpower which seems to have its origin in a curiously detached attitude
00:39:41.24 --> 00:39:46.68 toward human suffering finally they do not explain the even greater depths of incompetence
00:39:46.68 --> 00:39:53.24 shown on this occasion by the enemy of whom it has been said quote the Russians with more men in
00:39:53.24 --> 00:39:57.96 the field and immense potential reserves were even bigger muddlers than the iron veitors
00:39:58.68 --> 00:40:06.76 and seem to move in a vague dream of battle so this that whole last section is saying look
00:40:06.76 --> 00:40:10.92 there were some problems like maybe the government didn't support as much maybe there was some
00:40:10.92 --> 00:40:20.68 some some what do you say governmental stickiness right so there's some problems but you
00:40:20.68 --> 00:40:27.80 should not be losing like that it doesn't explain all these issues and especially that last part
00:40:27.80 --> 00:40:33.16 which has looked the Russians were like crap anyways it's not like they got beat by the freaking
00:40:33.16 --> 00:40:48.12 waffen SS in 1941 so there's issues next the next thing that he talks about in here and again
00:40:48.12 --> 00:40:53.64 there's so much more detail let's get this book there's so much more detail that is important
00:40:55.48 --> 00:41:02.76 the next section here chapter four talks about the bullrewore and we covered the bullrewore on
00:41:02.76 --> 00:41:12.12 podcast 233 the bullrewore the bullrew army consisted isn't an interesting statement about decentralized
00:41:12.12 --> 00:41:19.80 command the bullrew army consisted of 35,000 generals each combatant his own master defending his home land
00:41:20.36 --> 00:41:26.12 they were also they were also good marksman agile horsemen and determined members of a flexible
00:41:26.12 --> 00:41:33.24 knowledgeable gorilla force so that's what we're dealing with now the bullrewore's bullrew
00:41:33.24 --> 00:41:40.12 my compron remember that we wait for me to say it well kind of no that's the expression in
00:41:40.12 --> 00:41:45.56 an uh in in South Africa for the bullrewers it's like they're gonna come up with a plan the
00:41:45.56 --> 00:41:52.68 bullrew makes a plan that's my Afrikaans but that's the kind of people that you're fighting
00:41:52.68 --> 00:41:59.000 your fighting farmers you're fighting people that work with the land that ride horses that shoot that
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:07.40 honk that's who we're fighting against freaking legit legit enemy fast forward a little bit
00:42:09.16 --> 00:42:16.52 largely because they issued any form of sartorial elegance that means clothing by the way
00:42:16.52 --> 00:42:23.16 and preferred the wearing of civilian attire dark cloaks and floppy hats to the sorts of
00:42:23.16 --> 00:42:27.80 uniforms affected by the British the boars were dubbed the rabble of the illiterate peasants
00:42:27.80 --> 00:42:32.20 and their army utterly ludicrous so these guys were just wearing like what they wore in the field
00:42:32.20 --> 00:42:37.80 this is like if you went to war with Texas and they showed up wearing freaking leave eyes cowboy hats
00:42:38.84 --> 00:42:43.32 and rangler shirts right and you're like well who do these guys how are we gonna find a good
00:42:43.32 --> 00:42:52.12 to underestimate them basically what they're wearing yeah fast forward a little bit as Lord
00:42:52.12 --> 00:42:57.88 Kishner said the boars are not like the Sudanese who stood up to a fair fight they're always
00:42:57.88 --> 00:43:03.08 running away on their little ponies they're good many foreigners among the boars but they are
00:43:03.08 --> 00:43:07.08 easily shot as they do not slink about like the boars themselves so here you are complaining
00:43:07.72 --> 00:43:11.48 kind of tactics are these what are they doing we had to be careful that
00:43:11.48 --> 00:43:17.16 like in Iraq was like oh they're running around just doing these i.e.d's that's cowardly it's like oh
00:43:17.96 --> 00:43:24.60 they work yeah how about that since they're not as easily shot you're complaining that they're hard to kill yeah
00:43:24.60 --> 00:43:28.92 check I guess maybe they know what they're they're doing yeah sounds like they have a good plan yeah
00:43:31.32 --> 00:43:36.92 and by the way we did this to him in the revolutionary war but just FYI they're England
00:43:36.92 --> 00:43:44.20 they're their Lord Kishner remember what happened at Lexington in Concord you know we were scurrying
00:43:44.20 --> 00:43:48.60 around too and we kind of kicked your ass so you should have maybe learned some lessons there
00:43:50.20 --> 00:43:54.84 which is one of the points of this whole book is the fact that there's no lessons learned yeah
00:43:57.88 --> 00:44:01.64 this then was the background of the attitudes of the experties the British army brought to the
00:44:01.64 --> 00:44:06.68 poor war and you residual doubts about it's unfittedness for the expedition tend to dissipate when one
00:44:06.68 --> 00:44:11.24 considers the behavior of the generals put in charge the leading character was the commander and chief
00:44:11.24 --> 00:44:17.24 general sir redverse bullet according to a contemporary description there could be no finer
00:44:17.24 --> 00:44:24.60 choice for the South African adventure there is no stronger commander in the British army than this
00:44:24.60 --> 00:44:31.000 remote almost grimly resolute completely independent utterly fearless steadfast and vigorous man
00:44:31.88 --> 00:44:39.88 big bone square jaw strong minded strong headed smartness sagacity administrative capacity
00:44:39.88 --> 00:44:45.96 he was born to be a soldier of the very best English type needless to say the best type of all
00:44:47.80 --> 00:44:52.28 freaking legit right here's the reality
00:44:52.28 --> 00:44:58.44 unfortunately this assessment was at variance with the facts in all but two particular firstly he
00:44:58.44 --> 00:45:04.84 wasn't indeed big secondly though sadly lacking in moral courage he was undoubtedly brave when it
00:45:04.84 --> 00:45:10.60 came to physical danger in this respect as in many others he was not unlike raglan of the
00:45:10.60 --> 00:45:17.56 kermian war and indeed some other commanders of subsequent years of sir reverse of bullet as he
00:45:17.56 --> 00:45:22.60 became to be known so instead of his his name is redverse they started calling reverse instead
00:45:23.88 --> 00:45:28.04 Kruger writes at the risk of marring the contemporary description it should be mentioned that his
00:45:28.04 --> 00:45:32.20 big bones were particularly well covered especially in the region of his stomach and that
00:45:32.20 --> 00:45:37.24 is square jaw was not especially apparent above a double chin so this is just like a fat dude
00:45:38.76 --> 00:45:40.52 and they're trying to make him sound like a badass
00:45:40.52 --> 00:45:48.92 um what was his attitude like fast forward a little bit bullet loss no time in trying to
00:45:48.92 --> 00:45:52.52 rid himself of any direct responsibility for the conduct of the war by handing over the
00:45:52.52 --> 00:45:56.04 reigns to subordinate commanders to to whom he gave no further directives
00:46:00.12 --> 00:46:05.40 bullet subordinate general mothu and with eight thousand men was very nearly defeated by
00:46:05.40 --> 00:46:11.08 three thousand booers the few ins objective was the modern river a natural defense line for
00:46:11.08 --> 00:46:15.24 booers accordingly without any reconnaissance he ordered his troops to make a frontal attack
00:46:16.52 --> 00:46:21.72 are we starting to get a we start to understand the frontal attack might not be the best move
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.84 since he could not see the enemy he wrongly assumed that no enemy was there led by their officers
00:46:28.84 --> 00:46:33.96 the men advanced across the flat and open veled towards the river all went well until they were
00:46:33.96 --> 00:46:39.24 within easy range of the booers who had concealed themselves with what was subsequently described
00:46:39.24 --> 00:46:45.56 as a fiendish cunning below the deep banks of the river those of the thewans army who are not
00:46:45.56 --> 00:46:49.72 killed outright by the sudden blast of fire from the invisible booers spent the day lying
00:46:49.72 --> 00:46:55.64 prostrate under a scorching sun in a temperature of 110 unable to move forward or back they
00:46:55.64 --> 00:47:02.92 including the 70 wounded suffered extreme discomfort from thirst and slowly blistering skin
00:47:02.92 --> 00:47:08.12 the thewans remedy was to direct heavy artillery fire on the booer positions thanks to the
00:47:08.12 --> 00:47:12.84 ladders use of cover this braj had very little influence on the course of events apart from killing
00:47:12.84 --> 00:47:18.04 a number of his own troops through faulty range finding it was only under cover of darkness that
00:47:18.04 --> 00:47:22.44 the British evident eventually withdrew leaving behind 500 dead and wounded
00:47:25.80 --> 00:47:30.60 I keep falling into his little traps as I'm listening to you and the trap I keep falling into
00:47:30.60 --> 00:47:36.84 started up like hey here's this guy in charge and he's totally incompetent and he's he's going to
00:47:36.84 --> 00:47:40.68 relinquish the command of the control this whole responsibility to subordinates and I'm thinking
00:47:40.68 --> 00:47:45.08 awesome that's awesome I would love to be that subordinate cool I got an incompetent boss but at
00:47:45.08 --> 00:47:49.64 least he's letting me be in charge and the chap who keep falling into is how far down this goes this
00:47:50.12 --> 00:47:54.68 this sort of like illness of the organization at this leadership it isn't just the people of the
00:47:54.68 --> 00:48:00.84 very very top it's all the subordinate commanders as well because when I hear you say you have a weak boss
00:48:01.88 --> 00:48:06.68 I like that kind of fired up it cool this awesome three I'll be in charge this is great I can
00:48:06.68 --> 00:48:11.24 and I can do whatever I want because he doesn't seem to care but that's that's I've fallen in
00:48:11.24 --> 00:48:16.76 that trap a couple times down hearing you talk about how far down this goes of people that have
00:48:16.76 --> 00:48:21.16 should not be there for their dads or buying their position or whatever it might be
00:48:21.16 --> 00:48:28.36 I got to bring this up I'm bringing up right now there's a underlying this book this book
00:48:29.16 --> 00:48:35.72 catches so many of the themes that I talk about all the time and that we talk about all the time
00:48:36.92 --> 00:48:42.92 there's one theme that I've found throughout this book that never gets addressed
00:48:42.92 --> 00:48:49.88 never gets addressed in this book and it's an underlying theme that is so obvious as you read this book
00:48:51.72 --> 00:48:57.88 and that is the idea of detachment because every one of these military leaders
00:48:58.44 --> 00:49:03.88 as you read the decisions that they're making and you know that they're all caught up in their ego
00:49:03.88 --> 00:49:10.12 and their social structure and the hierarchy and the actual tactical engagement that they're in
00:49:10.12 --> 00:49:14.76 and what they can see they make it so you just sit there and think hey hold on a second you're
00:49:14.76 --> 00:49:20.44 gonna move crosses open feel the urnity like why you're doing this and the reason one of the reasons
00:49:20.44 --> 00:49:27.16 yes there's ego yes there's there's social structure and hierarchy and bravery and all those things
00:49:27.16 --> 00:49:34.60 yet they're all there but if you are in charge of something and you don't take a step back to actually
00:49:34.60 --> 00:49:40.84 assess what is happening how it's going to happen why you're gonna do it this way if you can't
00:49:40.84 --> 00:49:47.16 detach from these things you are going to fail and you're gonna fail all the time and that's one
00:49:47.16 --> 00:49:53.56 of the only themes that I talk about that we talk about that really doesn't get addressed here he never
00:49:53.56 --> 00:49:57.40 says hey and maybe I didn't catch it maybe we'll catch it the first time because I'm paying
00:49:57.40 --> 00:50:01.80 attention to it as we read it but he never says hey no one took a step back and looked at this plan
00:50:01.80 --> 00:50:09.16 doesn't really say that which is a huge red flag you know we were talking about this
00:50:10.20 --> 00:50:18.04 this commercial is that what it's called advertisement right we shot right but advertisement
00:50:18.04 --> 00:50:25.24 echo Charles wasn't charged of an advertisement you making a video for for jockel fuel gonna get some
00:50:25.24 --> 00:50:32.84 go right and I had a small role you know small role come one line right sure one line yep
00:50:33.56 --> 00:50:38.60 well when I I showed up so you guys are kind of done with the filming and I showed up to deliver my
00:50:38.60 --> 00:50:45.16 one line right and when I came in I kind of changed the script of not of my line but of the
00:50:45.16 --> 00:50:51.72 the I would say the lead actors was lying the straight up ending yeah well as I was
00:50:51.72 --> 00:50:57.40 I was trying to explain is like that's not because I'm smarter it's not because I'm funnier it's
00:50:57.40 --> 00:51:02.84 not because I'm better at writing it's because I when I came in your mind is filled with you know
00:51:02.84 --> 00:51:09.000 first of all four five hours of prep what you think the shots are gonna be right and writing
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.72 and then you've been on scene for how long were you an hour there yeah so you're on there for an
00:51:13.72 --> 00:51:17.000 hour you got all these different components in your head you're trying to assemble what it's
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:26.68 gonna look like I strolling you know fresh off of like a jocco go I'm kind of hyped ready to deliver
00:51:26.68 --> 00:51:33.56 my line and I hear the ending and I go but I'm detached and so I'm seeing it from a bigger perspective
00:51:33.56 --> 00:51:41.40 and I go hey the closing line should be this and you were like a little bit of resistance little bit
00:51:41.40 --> 00:51:46.84 of resistance because I know her hurts a little bit well okay go ahead go ahead I was gonna say the resistance
00:51:46.84 --> 00:51:52.28 was more like the feeling of momentum you know like okay we got to be getting we got everybody here
00:51:52.28 --> 00:51:56.84 it's warm the beginning then we got the the middle you know and the end is right after this so it's
00:51:56.84 --> 00:52:01.48 kind of like things are coming along you know so we're ready and we're kind of writing momentum
00:52:01.48 --> 00:52:06.36 and you change it it's like oh sure we got a kind of shift pivot as it were so it was kind of that a
00:52:06.36 --> 00:52:12.68 little bit but I did recognize immediately the thousand good ending and the only reason I was able
00:52:12.68 --> 00:52:17.64 to see that is because I was detached and as I came in kind of looked at the thing and saw how it's
00:52:17.64 --> 00:52:24.76 going to say okay and luckily your humble person you were like check you weren't like you know
00:52:24.76 --> 00:52:28.92 what your hey jocco you don't know how the whole thing goes together hey you know hey that's not
00:52:28.92 --> 00:52:33.72 well we're looking you know you could have given me 87 different excuses that I would have been like
00:52:33.72 --> 00:52:38.84 okay you know what I mean I'm not gonna impose on you and just be like change it because this isn't
00:52:38.84 --> 00:52:44.04 you know it's not like you're gonna win an Oscar for this freaking add a little baby you know so so
00:52:45.08 --> 00:52:52.04 but luckily your humble and you are you are detached enough to go hmm okay cool so that's what
00:52:52.60 --> 00:52:57.48 that's one thing that I see that I don't see in this book I don't see Dixon talking about the fact that
00:52:57.48 --> 00:53:05.24 one of the best skills for a person to have to overcome all these other problems is being able to
00:53:05.24 --> 00:53:18.04 detach take a step back yes I was just thinking about and we got we talked about detachment all the time
00:53:18.04 --> 00:53:23.64 all the time and I I was thinking about the situations you just described two of them you know
00:53:23.64 --> 00:53:28.28 between those two conflicts the cremian or in the bullrewerr is this idea that detachment only
00:53:28.28 --> 00:53:32.20 works at the people on your team or actually prioritizing the team being successful over these
00:53:32.20 --> 00:53:38.76 other things like the social pressure or or these other things that I know they sound outlandish
00:53:38.76 --> 00:53:45.32 I know that they sound outlandish the way you're describing this but but even inside these organizations
00:53:45.32 --> 00:53:55.56 it does Dave like oh man I kind of work for Jocco this is kind of his company and and I don't want to I don't want to make him mad so go go
00:53:55.56 --> 00:54:03.80 yeah yeah here's the interesting about what you're saying you because of what we do for a living
00:54:03.80 --> 00:54:09.40 you're already aware of those things right a person that's you're not you even what you just said like wait
00:54:09.40 --> 00:54:14.60 it's chocolate if that's a detachment you're assessing what's going on most people are just they're so
00:54:14.60 --> 00:54:18.92 caught up they're like I'm not gonna let Dave Burke get control this operation that that's what they that's
00:54:18.92 --> 00:54:24.52 the end state yeah the end state is I'm not gonna let Dave Burke run this thing or echoes I'm not
00:54:24.52 --> 00:54:29.64 gonna let Jocco cheat that's that's it I'm not gonna let Jocco change the way this script is going that is
00:54:29.64 --> 00:54:34.84 it he's that's the firefight right there in his head I'm not gonna let Jocco dictate what's happening
00:54:34.84 --> 00:54:40.76 I'm in charge hey Jocco we're doing it my way that's that's what happens that's what happens
00:54:40.76 --> 00:54:47.24 these guys yeah the fact of the matter is they they don't detach so they can't see it
00:54:48.20 --> 00:54:56.68 so it's yes you're right in the fact that you're right in the fact that they they aren't
00:54:56.68 --> 00:55:00.92 considering it but the reason that they're not considering it is because they can't even see it
00:55:00.92 --> 00:55:05.16 because it's all around them it's just the way they're thinking it's the way they're thinking
00:55:05.88 --> 00:55:09.56 which is freaking horrifying yeah that's the little horrifying part yeah
00:55:13.32 --> 00:55:17.08 gets worse by the way within a few days of his performance at moderate where he confirms
00:55:17.08 --> 00:55:21.16 the worst the worst fears of his critics and even more disastrous battle of
00:55:21.16 --> 00:55:29.16 makers foretimes makers fun time sorry to the people of South Africa to the Afrikaans I'm sorry
00:55:29.16 --> 00:55:34.20 makers fun time especially for a Dutch guy should be doing a little bit better the boars were
00:55:34.20 --> 00:55:41.88 concealed in a narrow in narrow trenches in front of his objective they waited patiently until
00:55:41.88 --> 00:55:46.28 the British came within easy range surprise was complete when they opened fire hail of lead
00:55:46.28 --> 00:55:49.40 swept through the ranks of the highland brigade within minutes the ground is carpeted with
00:55:49.40 --> 00:55:56.20 dead soldiers including the highland commander George O'ow shop who's too much for the remainder
00:55:56.20 --> 00:56:00.28 despite their training and discipline despite the honor of the regiment despite all the factors
00:56:00.28 --> 00:56:05.48 which the high command finally believed would induce uneducated soldiers to sacrifice themselves
00:56:05.48 --> 00:56:11.40 for the short coming of their generals they broke ranks turn tail and fled as they did so they
00:56:11.40 --> 00:56:20.52 were further pounded and demoralized by hitherto undetected batteries of blue or artillery fast forward
00:56:20.52 --> 00:56:24.92 a little bit myth you and was by no means the most foolhardy of the generals jah
00:56:28.68 --> 00:56:35.40 there was general feather stoneaw who at the battle of Belmont insisted on riding up and down in
00:56:35.40 --> 00:56:40.12 front of his men in full regalia thereby announcing his importance to the enemy and effectively
00:56:40.12 --> 00:56:47.24 hampering the fire of his own men it was not long before the boo is rectified his error by shooting
00:56:47.24 --> 00:56:51.000 off shooting them off of his horse there was general heart who at the battle of
00:56:51.96 --> 00:56:58.36 colenso inflicted 30 minutes parade ground drill on his brigade before marching them shoulder to
00:56:58.36 --> 00:57:04.28 shoulder in barracks square precision across the open veld against the booer position since it
00:57:04.28 --> 00:57:09.40 was broad daylight has densely packed column provided an irisistable target for every booer gun
00:57:09.40 --> 00:57:15.000 and rifle within range this battle in this battle the British were defeated with a loss of
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:22.52 1,139 casualties and ten guns against the booer losses of six dead in 21 wounded
00:57:29.64 --> 00:57:33.64 fast forward a little bit it is at this point it becomes necessary to introduce another concept
00:57:33.64 --> 00:57:38.44 which is relevant to the contact of the South African war it is that of the effects of
00:57:38.44 --> 00:57:44.04 psychological stress upon decision making it is perhaps their resistance to stress and their ability
00:57:44.04 --> 00:57:48.84 to carry on when things go wrong that good generals are most easily distinguished from poor ones
00:57:49.80 --> 00:57:54.84 which by the way if you can detach that's what's going to allow you to do that by this standard
00:57:54.84 --> 00:58:01.88 general bulleter physically so huge failed dismaly it resolute from the outset the three defeats
00:58:01.88 --> 00:58:09.64 sapt whatever confidence he ever had from being weak and fearful he became a veritable
00:58:09.64 --> 00:58:15.08 jelly of indecision his plans became vague and indefinite his specific orders scarcely more
00:58:15.08 --> 00:58:19.32 enlightening his lack of moral courage and the face of adversity revealed itself most clearly
00:58:19.32 --> 00:58:24.20 in his propensity for making scapegoats of his unfortunate subordinates those admittedly incompetent
00:58:24.20 --> 00:58:28.04 generals who had blundered on without direction or assistance from above while taking none of the
00:58:28.04 --> 00:58:37.80 blame himself again the direct antithesis of extreme ownership the nearest to such admission was
00:58:37.80 --> 00:58:45.16 a reference to bad luck bad luck it may have been but worse luck was to follow in the shape of that
00:58:45.16 --> 00:58:53.16 1,400 foot monument to military andeptitude spy and cop the totally unnecessary storming of this
00:58:53.16 --> 00:58:57.88 mini mountain was to the boor war what the charge of the light brigade had been in the crummy and war
00:58:59.48 --> 00:59:05.08 the details are as followed while still numbed by the series the defeats just recounted
00:59:05.08 --> 00:59:11.80 bullards army of 29,000 infantry 2600 mounted men eight field batteries and ten naval guns
00:59:11.80 --> 00:59:17.48 was enriched if that is the word by the arrival of a fresh division commanded by church
00:59:17.48 --> 00:59:24.76 sir Charles Warren fast forward a little bit the plan was went wrong for several reasons
00:59:24.76 --> 00:59:29.88 in the first place warrants division was far too small for the main attack the second reason
00:59:29.88 --> 00:59:36.20 for disaster lay in the character of Warren who's been described as a deletory yet fidgety overcocious yet
00:59:36.20 --> 00:59:44.44 is a res allute and totally ignorant regarding the use of cavalry he was also obsessive
00:59:44.44 --> 00:59:49.72 obstinate self opinionated and excessively bad tempered isn't an interesting how you hear bad
00:59:49.72 --> 00:59:53.72 tempered a lot when this guy is describing freaking knucklehead leaders
01:00:03.40 --> 01:00:07.08 this also included an obsession with enormous baggage train
01:00:07.08 --> 01:00:14.20 and fear that it might be destroyed by a non-existent enemy by non-existent enemy guns on
01:00:15.08 --> 01:00:19.96 the small mountains spy on cop so concerned was he with his baggage that he spent 26 hours
01:00:19.96 --> 01:00:24.92 personally supervising its transfer across the river the delay was invaluable to the boor so
01:00:24.92 --> 01:00:32.60 yeah this is the guy that had you know pianos longhorned gramophone's chests of drawers polo sticks
01:00:32.60 --> 01:00:36.84 like this is one of those guys and so he's trying to make sure that all of his baggage is
01:00:36.84 --> 01:00:46.60 getting where it needs to be and personally supervising this freaking savage fast forward a little bit
01:00:46.60 --> 01:00:50.84 so while the general stayed below the men were ordered up the steeply sloping mountainside so
01:00:50.84 --> 01:00:56.36 he kind of thought that we needed to take this this high ground spy on cop seems like a good call
01:00:56.36 --> 01:01:00.52 the men were ordered up the steeply sloping mountainside into a fog hardly less dense than
01:01:00.52 --> 01:01:05.16 that which clouded the minds of their commanders when in almost zero visibility they thought they
01:01:05.16 --> 01:01:09.96 had reached the summit the assault force altered congratulating themselves on the total absence of
01:01:09.96 --> 01:01:17.16 opposition raised the union track jack and tried to entrench the word the operative word is tried
01:01:17.16 --> 01:01:21.96 for the top was much like the rest of the mountain solid rock nobody had warned them of this
01:01:21.96 --> 01:01:26.92 by the way he didn't do a recon just FYI they decided to use sandbags only to find that no one
01:01:26.92 --> 01:01:32.36 had to remember to bring them while the miscued they did the best they could with pieces of rocks and
01:01:32.36 --> 01:01:38.04 clouds of earth only to well aware that this flimsy protection provided no overhead cover whatsoever
01:01:38.04 --> 01:01:42.20 if this gave them food for thought there was more to follow for with a further improvement in
01:01:42.20 --> 01:01:48.60 visibility they made a second disquieting discovery they were not where they thought they were
01:01:48.60 --> 01:01:54.12 instead of the summit they found themselves on a small plateau some way below the mountain top
01:01:54.12 --> 01:02:01.24 1,700 men on a piece of ground 400 by 500 yards and above them on three sides the boars
01:02:04.04 --> 01:02:09.80 the enemy opened fire within minute the ground was littered with corpses many with bullet holes
01:02:09.80 --> 01:02:14.52 in the side of the head or body owing to the lack of overhead cover the losses from
01:02:14.52 --> 01:02:18.52 shrapnel were even greater trapped in the seemingly hopeless position without any guidance or
01:02:18.52 --> 01:02:25.08 directives from their general the 200 lane caster fuselures laid down the arms and surrendered to the
01:02:25.08 --> 01:02:32.28 boars this their place was taken by reinforcement sent up from below meanwhile Warren and
01:02:32.28 --> 01:02:36.44 Bullard did nothing to help the hard press troops no doubt appalled by what was happening to
01:02:36.44 --> 01:02:40.92 his army on the heights above Warren supined at the best of times went into a state that has been
01:02:40.92 --> 01:02:42.04 described as paralytic
01:02:42.04 --> 01:02:49.88 important note a war correspondent who had witnessed the dire events on top of the mountain
01:02:49.88 --> 01:02:54.12 hurry down to the commanding general but instead of receiving this admittedly unsolicited
01:02:54.12 --> 01:02:58.36 information with gratitude Warren flew into a rage and demanded that the journalist should be
01:02:58.36 --> 01:02:59.72 arrested for insolence
01:02:59.72 --> 01:03:11.000 name of the war correspondent was Winston Churchill
01:03:12.20 --> 01:03:18.20 but before moving on to the next example it's worth placing the cramian and boar wars in the
01:03:18.20 --> 01:03:24.92 same perspective both present a picture of what appears to be unreleaved stupidity but
01:03:24.92 --> 01:03:30.76 more interesting is the psychological pattern of these events here was a rich and powerful nation
01:03:30.76 --> 01:03:37.08 anxious to assert assert its rights first in Russia then in South Africa what did it do but send out
01:03:37.08 --> 01:03:42.52 highly regimented armies which endeavored to make up encouraged discipline and visual splendor
01:03:42.52 --> 01:03:46.12 what they lacked in relevant training technology and adequate leadership
01:03:47.72 --> 01:03:52.76 as to the latter in each case a commander in chief was selected who despite his deficiencies
01:03:52.76 --> 01:03:58.12 remained in order to be popular with his troops for far longer than he deserved both men were
01:03:58.12 --> 01:04:03.72 genial courteous and kind both were inexperienced is irresolute and lacking moral courage
01:04:03.72 --> 01:04:08.04 both were rich and well-connected but both when the occasion demanded were only too ready to
01:04:08.04 --> 01:04:11.96 divest themselves of all responsibility for the errors which they had made
01:04:13.64 --> 01:04:17.16 and the ones seemed quite unable to learn from the mistakes of the other
01:04:17.16 --> 01:04:24.76 from the moment it might prove how to keep in mind certain characteristics of the incompetence
01:04:24.76 --> 01:04:32.60 just described they include so here's as we get into a list of problems number one an
01:04:32.60 --> 01:04:36.28 underestimation sometimes bordering on the arrogant of the enemy hmm check
01:04:36.28 --> 01:04:46.68 in equating war with sport oh that's a good one and inability to profit from past
01:04:46.68 --> 01:04:54.44 experience hello a resistance to adopting and exploiting available technological
01:04:54.44 --> 01:05:02.92 technological and novel tactics this is just a list of freaking what not to do
01:05:02.92 --> 01:05:08.76 and a version to reconnaissance coupled with a dislike of intelligence in both sense the word
01:05:08.76 --> 01:05:13.08 and i probably skipped over there's a lot of situations where they don't do any recon
01:05:13.08 --> 01:05:18.28 they're like oh yeah we know it to do and they just go and execute great physical bravery but
01:05:18.28 --> 01:05:25.40 little moral courage and apparent imperviousness by commanders to loss of life and human suffering
01:05:25.40 --> 01:05:35.08 a month that rank in file or it's converse and irrational and incapacitating state of compassion
01:05:35.08 --> 01:05:40.12 and indecisiveness in their senior commanders a tendency to lay blame on others boom
01:05:40.68 --> 01:05:47.32 a love of the frontal a sight assault boom a love of bull and we we covered a bit of this but
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.04 we brought up the term chicken shit actually someone sent a great i forget what document
01:05:54.04 --> 01:05:59.64 they got it from but the the term chicken shit is exactly i should have brought that definition
01:05:59.64 --> 01:06:04.04 it's exactly what i was trying to describe the the technical definition of chicken shit is
01:06:04.04 --> 01:06:14.12 perfect like meaningless imposed discipline for the sake of discipline um i love a smartness
01:06:14.12 --> 01:06:20.36 i love a bull smartness precision and strict preservation of the quote military pecking order
01:06:20.36 --> 01:06:28.28 a high regard for tradition and other aspects of convert conservatism a lack of creativity
01:06:28.28 --> 01:06:32.12 improvisation inventiveness and open-mindedness
01:06:34.60 --> 01:06:39.88 a tendency to issue moderate risks for tasks so difficult that failure might seem excusable
01:06:41.72 --> 01:06:48.92 and last but not least procrastination this is a good little filter to run yourself through
01:06:48.92 --> 01:06:56.52 once a week to see where you're at just a check on your damn self what do you got Dave
01:06:56.52 --> 01:07:02.60 i'm literally writing what the so as you went through that list i tried to just as quickly as i
01:07:02.60 --> 01:07:06.92 could just make the connection humility humility innovative depth default aggressive humility
01:07:06.92 --> 01:07:10.92 cover-move dichotomy cream ownership direct approach innovative depth detached
01:07:10.92 --> 01:07:16.60 debauchable and how quickly and this isn't like show the how smart i am it's like how easy
01:07:16.60 --> 01:07:20.92 it is to make the connection what you preface this was he kind of i think he listed three
01:07:21.80 --> 01:07:24.76 one was technology i forgot what the first one was and the third one was leadership
01:07:25.24 --> 01:07:33.000 and really the risk could just be one it's leadership but the title of this book is
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.92 is the title of book is the psychology of it's the it's the it's the individual's person psychology
01:07:38.92 --> 01:07:43.80 and when we're talking about these things is how painful it is to sit from the outside and watch
01:07:43.80 --> 01:07:49.80 the whole that they dig or just how obvious and to your point of detachment how obvious it is
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.60 it's not nuanced it's not like a slight little adjustment you're just sitting back you're watching
01:07:54.60 --> 01:07:59.96 this and there is you know there's zero chances it's gonna work not because we know the history
01:07:59.96 --> 01:08:04.04 but because of because of the setup that you're revealing this is the situation this is how
01:08:04.04 --> 01:08:07.72 these people make decisions this is the way they think like this is gonna fail this is gonna fail
01:08:08.28 --> 01:08:12.84 and how easy it is to attribute everything on one of those to a basic fundamental leadership
01:08:12.84 --> 01:08:17.88 behavior it's disturbing it's disturbing not the least of which is the one that repeats itself
01:08:18.52 --> 01:08:22.60 more than anything else which is what you talked about at the very beginning was humility
01:08:23.16 --> 01:08:28.28 just the inability to be humble it's it's it's it's it's hard to listen to you man yeah
01:08:29.56 --> 01:08:32.68 it is very difficult and it's about to get worse
01:08:32.68 --> 01:08:41.000 chapter five Indian inerlude which also includes a little section on afghanistan
01:08:43.56 --> 01:08:47.96 from the data considered so far it might be thought that military incompetence is confined
01:08:47.96 --> 01:08:53.08 to intraracial conflicts white against white unfortunately as suggested by the following
01:08:53.08 --> 01:08:58.68 account of a minor incident at the time of the Indian mutiny this particular prediction is not born
01:08:58.68 --> 01:09:03.88 out when it comes to interracial conflict a pattern of incompetence is little changed
01:09:05.16 --> 01:09:12.60 here is the story of fort ru y'all as recounted by p scott o'conner general wall poll
01:09:12.60 --> 01:09:19.48 wall poll who it appears that never before held the independent command was ordered to lead
01:09:19.48 --> 01:09:30.68 next position up the left bank of the gong gongi's river from luck now to rohick land rohil land
01:09:32.04 --> 01:09:36.84 to clear the rebels out from that part of the country the brigades set out from luck now
01:09:36.84 --> 01:09:42.44 on the seventh of April 1858 and on the morning of the 15th found itself in the vitty vicinity of
01:09:42.44 --> 01:09:49.96 fort ru y'all the troops had marched nine miles that morning but wall poll anxious to win his spurs
01:09:49.96 --> 01:09:55.56 with the least possible delay sent his force immediately to the assault the fort was the
01:09:55.56 --> 01:10:02.60 residents of a rebel landholder named narpatsing he had but three hundred followers at his command
01:10:03.08 --> 01:10:09.40 but taking advantage of the troubles which beset the british in india in the dark days of 1857
01:10:09.40 --> 01:10:15.40 he unfurled the flag of rebellion at ru y'all and bade the government defiance his stronghold
01:10:15.40 --> 01:10:21.08 was nothing very formidable on its northern eastern faces was strongly defended by a high mud wall
01:10:21.08 --> 01:10:26.84 and a broad and deep ditch covered by dense jungle but from the west in south it was open to attack
01:10:28.04 --> 01:10:33.80 as the wall on those sides were but a few feet high the defenders relying mainly on the jahil
01:10:33.80 --> 01:10:39.48 the waters of which lapped the fort to protect them from their enemies coming from that direction
01:10:40.84 --> 01:10:46.44 there were two gates to the fort and these open on the sides just mentioned and there is no
01:10:46.44 --> 01:10:51.32 doubt the general wall poll delivered the assault from the direction of the fort must have been
01:10:51.32 --> 01:10:58.84 quickly reduced with but a fraction of casualties which actually occurred it was the month of April
01:10:58.84 --> 01:11:06.28 and the water of the jahil was everywhere very shallow and in many places dried up so that the
01:11:06.28 --> 01:11:10.92 only obstacle to an assaulting party from that side was lacking so there's a place where you can
01:11:10.92 --> 01:11:14.92 assault this thing pretty easily because they're supposed to be a river there or some kind of a
01:11:14.92 --> 01:11:21.88 pond there but it's all dried up so that's the obvious place usually you use that for defense
01:11:21.88 --> 01:11:27.80 but it's not there it's like you have a moat but the moat is dried up okay well so that's where we're
01:11:27.80 --> 01:11:33.40 gonna attack however back to the book but general wall poll took no trouble to reconnoiter and even
01:11:33.40 --> 01:11:38.92 without a cursory examination of the position launched his men in a blundering haphazard manner
01:11:38.92 --> 01:11:45.24 against the strongest face of the fort the rebels it was reported were prepared to evacuate the
01:11:45.24 --> 01:11:50.36 place after firing a few rounds but when they saw the British advancing against the face which
01:11:50.36 --> 01:11:57.000 could be defended they changed their minds and determined to show fight now wall poll under the
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.16 mistake and impression that there was a gate on the east side of the fort directed captain
01:12:01.16 --> 01:12:05.40 Ross Grove to advance with a company of the 40 second highlanders through the wood in that
01:12:05.40 --> 01:12:10.60 direction and to hold the gate and prevent the enemy from escaping the company advanced in
01:12:10.60 --> 01:12:15.48 skirmishing order through the jungle before them and dashing across the open space of ground
01:12:15.48 --> 01:12:20.52 which lay between the forest and the fort found their progress impeded by the ditch which had
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:25.72 up until that point been invisible there was no alternative but to lie down on the edge of the
01:12:25.72 --> 01:12:32.76 counterscarp and there and as there was only a few paces between them in the enemy and no shelter
01:12:32.76 --> 01:12:39.32 whatsoever they were exposed to a galling fire and suffered severely they held onto their position
01:12:39.32 --> 01:12:43.88 however in a most heroic manner awaiting the development of the attack and the other directions
01:12:43.88 --> 01:12:48.36 but finding after a time that no other attack was being made groves and word to the general
01:12:48.36 --> 01:12:53.24 tellin that there was no gate and requested scaling ladders for the nestled do don't talk about a brave
01:12:53.24 --> 01:13:01.24 individual they're freaking under withering fire and there happens to be no gate and said
01:13:01.24 --> 01:13:03.80 hey dude we're out of here's like hey can you send us ladders maybe?
01:13:06.76 --> 01:13:12.76 meanwhile captain cave holy unaware of the ditch which had checked grove in his advance
01:13:12.76 --> 01:13:17.32 came up with his seeks and dashed into it with no ladders to help them out again they were
01:13:17.32 --> 01:13:23.56 shot down without mercy by the enemy no orders yet reach grove nor were their scaling ladders
01:13:23.56 --> 01:13:28.36 forthcoming so a second messenger was dispatched to the general asking for reinforcements the general
01:13:28.36 --> 01:13:32.60 apparently now alarmed at the consequences of his own rashness hastily sent the heavy guns around
01:13:32.60 --> 01:13:39.80 to the west and ordered a bombardment of the fort from that side I'm sure if you're tracking this you
01:13:39.80 --> 01:13:44.28 can see what's coming a very natural result followed some of the balls from the guns going over the
01:13:44.28 --> 01:13:50.12 fort fell among our men on the other side for they had not yet been withdrawn a report to this
01:13:50.12 --> 01:13:56.44 effect was carried to Adrian hope who it once an Adrian hope by the way this is like the the son of
01:13:57.16 --> 01:14:05.72 of Earl John hope who's like a royal and a very respected heroic soldier from the peninsula wars
01:14:05.72 --> 01:14:11.08 so Adrian hope a report to this effect was carried to Adrian hope who it once rode off to inform
01:14:11.08 --> 01:14:17.56 wallpole but from what followed it appears that ladder doubted the accuracy of the statement
01:14:17.56 --> 01:14:25.48 for hope immediately returned to see for himself to another thing that you're going to hear in this
01:14:25.48 --> 01:14:30.44 book is when you hear something that doesn't quite fit in you deny it this is something we see every
01:14:30.44 --> 01:14:39.08 damn day oh it doesn't match your uh near your narrative cool ignore it good god general
01:14:39.08 --> 01:14:45.80 exclaimed grove on seeing him this is no place for you you must lie down but the kindly warning
01:14:45.80 --> 01:14:50.60 came to late for even at that moment hope fell back into the speakers arm shot through the chest
01:14:50.60 --> 01:14:56.28 soon after came the order to retire and general wallpole road back to camp onto the cover of
01:14:56.28 --> 01:15:02.12 darkness that night the rebels slipped out of the fort and made good their escape the loss
01:15:02.12 --> 01:15:07.000 the loss the country sustained by the death of will be Douglas Bramley Harrington and of the
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.24 hundred and odd men uselessly sacrifice to before ruyah was great but the loss of Adrian hope
01:15:13.24 --> 01:15:18.52 was a cause for national sorrow his death was mourned on the spot by every man in the camp
01:15:18.52 --> 01:15:22.04 loud and deeply incentives against the opposite stupidity which it caused it
01:15:31.08 --> 01:15:34.92 general wallpoles on half the expedition was not the first disaster to be too
01:15:34.92 --> 01:15:40.76 a fall the British army in India 16 years previously in 1842 a catastrophe occurred beside which
01:15:40.76 --> 01:15:47.56 the events at for ruyah seemed scarcely worth a mention quote the road was strewn with mangled corpses
01:15:47.56 --> 01:15:52.76 of their comrade's and the stench of death in the air all along the route they had been passing
01:15:52.76 --> 01:15:58.60 little groups of camp followers starving frostbitten and many of them in a state of gibbering idiocy
01:15:58.60 --> 01:16:05.56 the afghans not troubling to kill these stragglers had simply stripped them and left the cold
01:16:05.56 --> 01:16:10.44 to do its work and now the poor wretched were huddling together naked in the snow striving
01:16:10.44 --> 01:16:15.32 hopelessly to keep warm by the heat of their own bodies there were women and little children among
01:16:15.32 --> 01:16:21.48 them who pitiously stretched out their hands for help later the afghans were to report with relish
01:16:21.48 --> 01:16:26.28 that the unhappy fugitives in their blind instinct to perform preserve life a little longer
01:16:26.28 --> 01:16:31.000 had been reduced to eating the corpses of their fellows but they all died in the end
01:16:35.24 --> 01:16:40.60 the British retreat from kaboole in the first afghan war was described by field marshaled sur general
01:16:40.60 --> 01:16:46.28 templar as the quote most disgraceful and humiliating episode in our history of war against the
01:16:46.28 --> 01:16:52.36 against an Asian enemy up to that time and quote judging from the details of how a British army of
01:16:52.36 --> 01:16:58.52 4,500 men was wiped out by what was in comparison with the British strength the handful of afghan
01:16:58.52 --> 01:17:03.16 tribesmen the field marshal's words were are nothing of an overstatement
01:17:07.40 --> 01:17:11.40 i'm gonna fast forward a little bit so so what did the British do wrong how did they end up in
01:17:11.40 --> 01:17:16.44 this situation in afghanistan in this worst possible site the British laid out a camp so they
01:17:16.44 --> 01:17:19.56 they had to figure out where they were going to build a camp and the worst possible site the
01:17:19.56 --> 01:17:25.24 British laid out a camp to the worst possible design not only was the two was the two mile perimeter
01:17:25.24 --> 01:17:30.28 a purely nominal obstacle consisting of a low wall and narrow ditch far too long to be defended
01:17:30.28 --> 01:17:36.20 by the numbers it enclosed but the whole was open at it northern and do a compound of dwellings
01:17:36.20 --> 01:17:42.60 for the British envoy and his staff this hops this hatch patch of houses positively invited
01:17:42.60 --> 01:17:48.12 infiltration by even the least intrepid of enemies to complete this incurigible behavior there had
01:17:48.12 --> 01:17:53.32 been one final act of such unbelievable stupidity that its repercussions were to lead to the
01:17:53.32 --> 01:17:58.76 death of an army by the orders of the commanding officer will be caught in the army's
01:17:58.76 --> 01:18:03.80 commissarth store stores were constructed a quarter mile outside the contandement
01:18:05.16 --> 01:18:10.84 so they have their camp and they build they put their supplies a quarter mile outside the camp
01:18:11.56 --> 01:18:16.28 the consequences of this division decision were tragic and inevitable when the afghans finally
01:18:16.28 --> 01:18:21.16 rose up against the British the army were promptly cut off from their supplies thus it was under
01:18:21.16 --> 01:18:26.44 the threat of starvation that they ultimately capitulated to akbar kong the afghan leader and
01:18:26.44 --> 01:18:29.64 began to retreat which cost them all their lives
01:18:38.68 --> 01:18:44.60 I'm really glad you brought up the concept of detachment being maybe he gets absent from from
01:18:44.60 --> 01:18:50.84 at least from an explicit sense of you but you're trying to piece together how this is possible
01:18:50.84 --> 01:18:56.68 from a from a professional maybe the most professional military in the world at least historically
01:18:56.68 --> 01:19:00.44 at that point yes you know what I mean like you said not a bunch of just jv dude trying to put
01:19:00.44 --> 01:19:05.88 things something is together and the only thing I can get in my head is what you you talked about
01:19:05.88 --> 01:19:14.36 earlier is is the the inability to to recognize the potential and so the disbelief of hey if we do
01:19:14.36 --> 01:19:19.24 this you know um they could attack us and kill us all and like nope can't happen cannot happen
01:19:19.24 --> 01:19:24.04 and being unable to acknowledge that if something isn't the way you think that it is and
01:19:24.04 --> 01:19:28.68 some of going okay I gotta think someone's going hey boss do you think we should bring it inside
01:19:28.68 --> 01:19:34.92 the lines because it could create some potential risk for us and the answer is that can't happen
01:19:34.92 --> 01:19:39.40 or some I'm trying to create in my mind some version of that where the disbelief is so high
01:19:39.40 --> 01:19:44.84 that they don't even recognize I can't come up with another way to understand how it could be so bad
01:19:44.84 --> 01:19:50.12 other than when you made that connection of detachment and how do you deal with with information
01:19:50.12 --> 01:19:57.000 that you can't process you just deny that it happened how old is your oldest daughter 12 okay so
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.96 if I said you're oldest daughter and what type of military training is she had you know what I'm saying
01:20:03.96 --> 01:20:12.20 like you take a 12 year old girl that plays guitar and is on the freaking softball team whatever
01:20:12.20 --> 01:20:18.20 yeah and you say hey listen I want you to design a fort to defend yourself from bad guys
01:20:19.64 --> 01:20:25.32 here's what you have here's the supplies that you have there's zero chance zero chance
01:20:25.32 --> 01:20:29.16 that your daughter says you know what here's where we're gonna put all of our guns and all of our
01:20:29.16 --> 01:20:35.08 army and we're gonna put our supplies way over here there's no chance that that happens freaking ridiculous
01:20:38.28 --> 01:20:43.72 the power of the psychology of of disbelief or whatever I'm coming up with the term of
01:20:43.72 --> 01:20:50.12 you say something I'm like that can't be possible so my only choice is to dismiss it yeah and
01:20:50.12 --> 01:20:56.28 and again the detachment piece if you sit there and come up with a plan yourself you're not
01:20:56.28 --> 01:21:00.60 gonna see these things you've got to even if you have even if you have to let your 12 year old
01:21:00.60 --> 01:21:06.68 daughter come up with a plan but dude is it is it is it's so unreasonable for me to just say hey man
01:21:06.68 --> 01:21:12.20 can you at least put your supplies inside the lines from a professional military I have no idea
01:21:12.20 --> 01:21:17.56 why that decision was made it doesn't really talk about it you know is it like hey well I mean
01:21:17.56 --> 01:21:24.28 I can't even really think of a reason right now right um hey we don't want the stores to be
01:21:24.28 --> 01:21:31.24 attracting bears I mean I don't know unless like that's why you might not stay with your food if
01:21:31.24 --> 01:21:39.32 you're in Alaska right I don't know what they're thinking it's it's craziness but if you're all
01:21:39.32 --> 01:21:44.12 wrapped up in it you can't you're not gonna see it I guess the other thing that you might not see
01:21:44.12 --> 01:21:46.76 is if you're too far away from it if you're the boss and you're like hey just go ahead and put
01:21:46.76 --> 01:21:50.60 the stores wherever you want and you know you're like well you know I want this to look like an
01:21:50.60 --> 01:21:53.48 organized camps I don't want a bunch of crabs sitting around here so we're gonna move it out there
01:21:53.48 --> 01:21:59.32 and I don't pay attention to it yeah so maybe there's too much detachment my guess is not enough
01:21:59.32 --> 01:22:02.84 well I mean I think there's some validity to that comment though it's certain elements
01:22:02.84 --> 01:22:07.40 throughout this you're talking about people that are so far detached there they're they're miles
01:22:07.40 --> 01:22:12.04 so they're so far away that there's not even a connection to the potential risk that come from that so
01:22:12.04 --> 01:22:17.88 I think you're right I think there is elements of this is like I don't the the boss doesn't
01:22:17.88 --> 01:22:21.72 doesn't doesn't seem to care about these critical fundamental things because he is like oh I got to
01:22:21.72 --> 01:22:27.72 make sure my personal gear gets across this river for 28 hours and this guy is so detached from
01:22:27.72 --> 01:22:33.88 things while he's so focused it on and these other things yep yep and there's a dichotomy for sure
01:22:34.44 --> 01:22:43.08 oddly enough uh the government of India chose this moment to a point major general William George
01:22:43.08 --> 01:22:50.04 Keith Elfin Stone as commander and chief in Afghanistan he was to say the least and an
01:22:50.04 --> 01:22:55.64 fortunate candidate described at the time as quote the most incompetent soldier that was to be found
01:22:55.64 --> 01:23:04.04 among the officers of requisite rank and it sucks because we're laughing and you're going to
01:23:04.04 --> 01:23:08.84 see what happens and it's freaking heinous even if necessary as qualifications were certainly
01:23:08.84 --> 01:23:17.48 not sufficient they were they were that he was quote of good repute gentlemanly manners and aristocratic
01:23:17.48 --> 01:23:22.68 connections so that's why he's getting hired he's good repute he's gentlemanly manners and the
01:23:22.68 --> 01:23:29.16 aristocratic connections this is like the opposite of the of the BTF Tony in case a war break loss
01:23:29.16 --> 01:23:33.88 like hey I got to you got to scrap you want me to go you want to take a bunch of people and live
01:23:33.88 --> 01:23:38.76 out in the middle of you know bad guy country this is not I don't want anyone with gentlemanly
01:23:38.76 --> 01:23:43.32 manners I want somebody with that can knows how to throw a hatchet yeah plan what that nice guy who's
01:23:43.32 --> 01:23:50.28 well connected no I don't want that guy he had last seen active service at waterloo 25 years
01:23:50.28 --> 01:23:55.24 previously and head since been on half pay he was elderly and so stricken with gout that he could
01:23:55.24 --> 01:24:04.68 scarcely move like general sir redverse bullard half a century later Elfin Stone had no
01:24:04.68 --> 01:24:08.84 illusion about his unfitness for the job and it pleaded that his health made him quite unsuited
01:24:08.84 --> 01:24:14.12 to the demands that would be put upon him but Lord Auckland the governor general was adamant and
01:24:14.12 --> 01:24:19.16 so the gentle courteous Elfin Stone was shipped off to Kabul once there whatever shreds of
01:24:19.16 --> 01:24:24.12 self-confidence he may have had were speedily removed firstly by the ludicrous nature of the army's
01:24:24.76 --> 01:24:31.72 contonement and secondly by encountering for the first time his new second in command
01:24:31.72 --> 01:24:38.28 Brigadier Shelton a rough brute of uncertain temper so appalled with Elfin Stone by the army's
01:24:38.28 --> 01:24:43.56 location that he offered a biopster rounding lands so he could then clear the suitable fields of fire
01:24:43.56 --> 01:24:48.04 his generous offer was refused about Shelton he could do nothing so he kind of showed up and recognize
01:24:48.04 --> 01:25:00.04 there in a bad spot fast forward a little bit there's a there's another area and he goes
01:25:00.68 --> 01:25:05.48 trying to figure these things out Elfin Stone ordered Shelton to march on the fortress this is
01:25:05.48 --> 01:25:11.48 another area no sooner had this order been received though that it was counter-mandered Shelton
01:25:11.48 --> 01:25:17.000 on impressed by this stop-go policy reported retorted that we're torred sharply that if there was
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.08 an insurrection in the city it was not a moment for indecision and recommended that Elfin Stone
01:25:23.08 --> 01:25:27.88 at once decide upon what measure we should adopt Elfin Stone then counter-mandered his counter-man
01:25:28.68 --> 01:25:34.04 and once more ordered Shelton to march at once to balahasar that's an area where they were
01:25:34.04 --> 01:25:39.16 having issues but barely at Shelton started before he was overtaken by another order to the effect
01:25:39.16 --> 01:25:43.48 that he should halt and remain where he was but no sooner had this order been received reducing
01:25:43.48 --> 01:25:49.24 the second in command to a state of approaching apolexie that it was followed by the inevitable
01:25:49.24 --> 01:25:54.84 counter order it seemed that he was after all to proceed with his men to the fort and this
01:25:54.84 --> 01:25:59.16 surprisingly he did meanwhile Elfin Stone was canvassing opinions as to what the do next I mean this
01:25:59.16 --> 01:26:05.08 is just a freaking disaster when Elfin Stone if did act when eventually Elfin Stone did act it was
01:26:05.08 --> 01:26:11.48 a case of two little two late Macnaught and a brave there's a guy that tries to sort of
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.52 figure out a negotiated deal a guy named Macnaughton it says Macnaught and a braveer man the
01:26:18.52 --> 01:26:24.12 Elfin Stone tried to double cross the afghans it was murdered first pains and there's another
01:26:24.12 --> 01:26:34.28 like British British civil servant that gets murdered fast forward a little bit more again
01:26:34.28 --> 01:26:38.84 we'll get these books so you can understand these a little bit more fully while rage and a
01:26:38.84 --> 01:26:43.72 thirst for revenge consumed the lower ranks of the army those at the top became increasingly
01:26:43.72 --> 01:26:49.56 indecisive and anxious to appease inevitable inevitably the afghans surrender terms stiffened
01:26:49.56 --> 01:26:55.48 until finally Elfin Stone in response to empty promises of safe conduct found himself agreeing that
01:26:55.48 --> 01:27:02.60 his army without its ordinance but in combat by 12,000 non-combatants including many women and
01:27:02.60 --> 01:27:11.24 children would go back the way they had come so they decided to give up arms this may sound
01:27:11.24 --> 01:27:16.28 familiar to everyone right now there in afghanistan they decided oh if you let us out of here
01:27:16.28 --> 01:27:22.92 will give up our arms and and when we go to give up our arms that's okay but we also have a bunch of
01:27:22.92 --> 01:27:28.28 our wives and children with us and I don't know if I made that clear yet this is the old school
01:27:28.28 --> 01:27:33.64 you know imperial idea you go on deployment you're gonna go for years you're gonna take your wife and
01:27:33.64 --> 01:27:43.64 family with you having decided upon the disastrous plan of trying to reach jallolabad in the
01:27:43.64 --> 01:27:48.68 depths of winter across mountain ranges infested with hostile tribesmen Elfin Stone proceeded to
01:27:48.68 --> 01:27:54.20 make matters worse by further procrastination right up to January 6, 1842 he remained in agony of
01:27:54.20 --> 01:27:58.92 mind as to whether or not he should commit any commit his army to the march and win on that
01:27:58.92 --> 01:28:03.40 faithful day they eventually set off he changes mind when half the force were already on their way
01:28:03.40 --> 01:28:07.56 like you can't make this up like if I told you that this guy was changing his mind every 20
01:28:07.56 --> 01:28:13.48 minutes or every day you just wouldn't believe me it doesn't sound real he tried to stop them but
01:28:13.48 --> 01:28:20.76 now his order to hold was disobeyed for good or ill the die was cast it was for ill so here's this
01:28:20.76 --> 01:28:29.48 group walking unarmed through afghanistan again this may sound familiar they walk here we go
01:28:29.48 --> 01:28:35.56 without food firewood or or any shelter beyond that provided by whole scraped in the snow many died
01:28:35.56 --> 01:28:41.64 each night by day as they traversed grim passes thousands more died at the hands of
01:28:41.64 --> 01:28:48.92 murderous guilt's eyes which is a pasting tribe like hill people at the end of four days with
01:28:48.92 --> 01:28:55.88 70 miles still to go only 850 remained of the original 4,500 soldiers by the end of the tent they
01:28:55.88 --> 01:29:01.32 their number had been reduced to 450 throughout this pitiful adventure Elfin Stone despite the trail
01:29:01.32 --> 01:29:06.44 of corpses which lay behind him retained a pathetic and wholly unjustified faith in the afghan
01:29:06.44 --> 01:29:17.48 leaders promise of safe conduct hmm by the end of the fifth day the total losses of soldiers
01:29:17.48 --> 01:29:23.64 and civilians had risen to 12,000 and one officer described it this was there was literally a
01:29:23.64 --> 01:29:29.64 continuous lane of poor wretches of men women and children dead and dying from the cold or wounds
01:29:29.64 --> 01:29:38.84 unable to move and treated their comrades to kill them to put an end to their misery
01:29:43.72 --> 01:29:48.92 I mean it's just it's horrible how did this something how did this unfold here's Elfin Stone
01:29:48.92 --> 01:29:54.04 this refined and gentle creature manifested what at first sight may appear to be some curiously
01:29:54.04 --> 01:30:00.76 inconsistent characteristics by his own admission he sought the bubble reputation in India and yet
01:30:00.76 --> 01:30:05.56 when given important command shrank from the responsibilities it entailed he was hopelessly
01:30:05.56 --> 01:30:12.04 indecisive lacking in moral courage and suggestible yet could on occasions manifest irrational
01:30:12.04 --> 01:30:17.48 pig headiness he wobbled when he should have been firm yet was rigid when he should have been flexible
01:30:17.48 --> 01:30:25.96 one nightmare that is finally he was courteous and kind retaining the affection of many of his
01:30:25.96 --> 01:30:31.64 followers right up to the end yet could be totally lacking in compassion for many of those who
01:30:31.64 --> 01:30:39.000 had suffered at his hands this is this thing to watch out for by the way people that are super nice
01:30:40.12 --> 01:30:45.48 and get along really well with everybody but they make bad decisions a lot and people just
01:30:45.48 --> 01:30:59.000 kind of like can't get mad at him just to just to wrap this section up to conclude this account
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:05.88 of the total dissolution of an army on January 13th 1842 soldiers on guard at the British
01:31:05.88 --> 01:31:12.60 Fortan in Jalalabad saw a single horsemen riding toward them with all the speed that his
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:19.64 main and worn out horse could muster it was the surgeon doctor Bryden the only man it seemed to
01:31:19.64 --> 01:31:27.48 survive the fearful journey from Kabul and the footnote here is that Bryden was the only European
01:31:27.48 --> 01:31:32.44 to arrive at Jalalabad but in the days after his arrival a few Indian soldiers and a number of
01:31:32.44 --> 01:31:38.76 followers also completed the journey elephant stone himself died of dysentery after being made captive
01:31:38.76 --> 01:31:51.88 of Akbar Khan we were laughing a couple minutes ago and I don't know I wish I could remember
01:31:51.88 --> 01:31:55.96 the word there's a word that described like when your reaction doesn't actually match what
01:31:55.96 --> 01:32:02.20 you're feeling and I forgot what that word is but it's it's the level of disbelief it
01:32:02.20 --> 01:32:06.60 made this reaction that I'm having adhering this when you're laughing at the description
01:32:06.60 --> 01:32:13.24 comes from like the level of tragedy this is this is a lot because I didn't read this you know
01:32:13.24 --> 01:32:17.24 I had actually I had this book I mean I knew I kind of knew this was coming but I didn't do
01:32:17.24 --> 01:32:20.44 the what you did I didn't do this cover to cover depth I kind of spun around and you would
01:32:20.44 --> 01:32:26.28 share some things with me the depth of here is much more than I kind of anticipated and
01:32:27.24 --> 01:32:31.64 you still have for me is still this hard time connecting the behavior and the tolerance of the
01:32:31.64 --> 01:32:36.68 behavior to the outcome which is real human life that that's the piece and if you look at it
01:32:36.68 --> 01:32:45.40 kind of the in the larger sense of of the precursors to World War I it makes it even that much more
01:32:45.40 --> 01:32:56.60 difficult to believe because if you were going to give any potential free pass would be you didn't
01:32:56.60 --> 01:33:02.52 see this coming if you were if you if somehow that could be the case and so whatever potential
01:33:02.52 --> 01:33:08.68 nail in the coffin is left on hit is you didn't see this coming and this is just tail upon tail
01:33:08.68 --> 01:33:15.40 upon tail upon tail of of of of a total disregard and the hardest part about that is what you
01:33:15.40 --> 01:33:20.36 set at the very beginning is they don't learn any lessons from it yep and I think that's where
01:33:20.36 --> 01:33:24.92 the disbelief from me comes from where I'm laughing like almost in in literal disbelief of
01:33:24.92 --> 01:33:29.80 there's no way this is going to happen again knowing what this all leads up to as well and let me tell
01:33:29.80 --> 01:33:36.92 you how easy this is how easy this is and this is what's so freaking crazy you and I look at
01:33:36.92 --> 01:33:42.92 a situation like this and we go uh there's one thing wrong bad leadership bad leadership oh you
01:33:42.92 --> 01:33:46.28 got a problem like that it's bad leadership did they pick a bad spot why they pick a bad spot
01:33:46.28 --> 01:33:50.52 because they got bad leadership like this is just bad leadership bad leadership bad leadership so
01:33:50.52 --> 01:33:58.36 at some point you look at these disasters and you say hey our freaking leadership selection training
01:33:59.48 --> 01:34:04.76 is wrong we're doing something wrong we need to fix it instead what do they do they blame the
01:34:04.76 --> 01:34:10.20 troops they blame the weather they blame the enemy that's what they do and that's accepted
01:34:10.20 --> 01:34:16.84 up and down the chain of command it's a freaking disaster it's crazy and this was look I
01:34:16.84 --> 01:34:24.52 yeah we'd have a bad serial opportunity coming through zero times zero times did I say wow the
01:34:24.52 --> 01:34:29.80 troops are all jacked up wow the E5s don't know how to work the machine guns wow the freaking
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.72 the the the corpsman doesn't know how to work on people the the point man doesn't how to
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.76 navigate zero times did I say that now would you have a bad free-compoint man occasion that
01:34:42.76 --> 01:34:46.04 we get lost yeah and you know what good leadership would say hey dude you're going to
01:34:46.04 --> 01:34:49.08 wear a scared you're right now you know we won't work on your did you have somebody that
01:34:49.08 --> 01:34:53.48 wasn't maybe not too great on a machine gun what they do the leadership said hey bro you need
01:34:53.48 --> 01:34:57.64 to go out do some extra machine gun called classes and courses you need to run some drills so you're
01:34:57.64 --> 01:35:03.64 better never did I say well you know this puttune is gonna fail this block of training because
01:35:03.64 --> 01:35:09.08 their machine gunners because their riflemen because of any other reason then the freaking
01:35:09.08 --> 01:35:13.56 leader is jacked up totally that's what's going on and either the leader figures it out or you
01:35:13.56 --> 01:35:17.32 got to replace them and that's a hundred percent of the time that's a hundred percent of the time because
01:35:17.32 --> 01:35:21.56 if you're even if you're in a fantasy world you had a platoon come in where all the machine gunners
01:35:21.56 --> 01:35:25.64 are terrible all the people are fat and out of shape no no all of that you could be traced back to oh
01:35:26.76 --> 01:35:30.76 is there is there genetic makeup in this this seal between somehow different than all of our
01:35:30.76 --> 01:35:37.56 ones or is there actually a leader who for the last 18 months has been tolerating or not holding
01:35:37.56 --> 01:35:41.56 a standard or not not training or not what has allowed this to happen first of all we know it
01:35:41.56 --> 01:35:45.56 doesn't happen but even if it did is there's something unique about those people that doesn't
01:35:45.56 --> 01:35:51.32 allow them to operate a machine gun or is it a leader tolerating this behavior to let that
01:35:51.32 --> 01:35:56.28 place to get to a state that's so bad that they're incompetent and again I'm even saying that just
01:35:56.84 --> 01:36:02.60 just to reinforce the idea that we know that it happens 0% of the time but even if it did in a
01:36:02.60 --> 01:36:07.64 fantasy world it still comes back to the exact same reason why there's a leader allowing that to happen
01:36:07.64 --> 01:36:12.68 at some point in my career probably when I read about face for the 19th time and he talks
01:36:12.68 --> 01:36:19.32 about the fact that there's no bad teams only bad leaders that that changed my perspective for the
01:36:19.32 --> 01:36:26.12 rest of my life because you look at a jacked up organization a platoon a task unit a team
01:36:26.12 --> 01:36:33.32 a battalion a company a business you look at it and you see problems you go oh it's oh I already know
01:36:33.32 --> 01:36:39.16 what the problem is I already know what the problem is and yet as to your point
01:36:40.28 --> 01:36:49.32 despite these failures in India in Afghanistan in Crimea in the Boer Wars in South Africa despite
01:36:49.32 --> 01:36:55.16 all these failures failure upon failure upon failure upon failure which is freaking
01:36:56.20 --> 01:37:01.24 a red flashing light when you look at it with hindsight and you go it's leadership leadership leadership
01:37:01.24 --> 01:37:05.40 and yet you're gonna see they're not they're not even developing their leaders properly
01:37:06.12 --> 01:37:11.24 they're making any changes and by the way let me throw this out there I've worked with the brits
01:37:11.24 --> 01:37:16.12 the freaking brits are outstanding totally the brits are freaking outstanding soldiers there are some of the
01:37:16.12 --> 01:37:21.56 most professional human beings never even mind military there are some of the most professional
01:37:21.56 --> 01:37:28.60 human beings have ever interacted with in my life so obviously now they've made some steps but
01:37:28.60 --> 01:37:34.92 and just just another thought I keep having and this came up for me we talked about it
01:37:34.92 --> 01:37:43.24 during wars a racket 300 that is is is these are hard stories to listen to these are hard
01:37:43.24 --> 01:37:48.52 stories for me to sit here as an as an audience member of this podcast listening to you talk about it
01:37:48.52 --> 01:37:52.52 is to make sure that that we don't fall into the trap of oh this is jacotone the story
01:37:52.52 --> 01:37:59.000 about a bunch of other incompetent leaders the the ease with which we've we can as leaders especially
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.04 we get put in charge how easy it is to slide into some of those habits maybe not to this degree
01:38:04.04 --> 01:38:09.40 maybe not to this magnification but this is not a story to be to be taken about what's wrong
01:38:09.40 --> 01:38:14.12 and everybody else it's how easy a regular human being can be placed into a position and fall into the
01:38:14.12 --> 01:38:20.84 trap of being a bad leader through things like humility humility humility humility detachment
01:38:20.84 --> 01:38:28.12 and that these are tales that that that the lens that you got to look at is is is a mirror
01:38:28.12 --> 01:38:35.24 as much as anything else like hey do I do I do some of these things yet we do leaders fall into
01:38:35.24 --> 01:38:40.68 these traps yeah make yourself that checklist that's right am I doing this yeah
01:38:43.08 --> 01:38:47.16 all right this brings us two chapter six which is the first world war
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:49.16 and
01:38:54.84 --> 01:39:00.44 here we go only the most blankered could deny that the first world war exemplified every aspect of
01:39:00.44 --> 01:39:08.20 high-level military incompetence for sure lack of imaginative leadership inept decisions
01:39:08.20 --> 01:39:14.28 ignoring of military intelligence under estimation of the enemy delusional optimism
01:39:14.28 --> 01:39:20.20 and monumental wastage of human resources has surely never had it equal
01:39:24.04 --> 01:39:29.48 can you imagine looking at what's happening and you see all those things occurring
01:39:33.48 --> 01:39:39.40 in an age when it has become fashionable to question authority it may well seem strange that a
01:39:39.40 --> 01:39:49.08 bare 60 years ago a millions of ordinary men living in indescribable conditions could
01:39:49.08 --> 01:39:55.24 with courage with a courage fortitude and cheerfulness past human comprehension
01:39:56.36 --> 01:40:03.80 meekly carry out the lethal decisions of well fed generals comfortably housed many miles
01:40:03.80 --> 01:40:09.72 behind the place where their orders were being translated into several kinds of pointless death
01:40:13.16 --> 01:40:18.36 a politics for this period found good things to say of some jett some of the generals who took
01:40:18.36 --> 01:40:24.36 part we are told that haig did the best he could given the conditions of the western front
01:40:24.36 --> 01:40:32.12 that he was rock-like and tenacious joffery saving grace so it has been said was that he was a
01:40:32.12 --> 01:40:37.000 skilled politician and the only man with enough prestige to dominate frances allies
01:40:38.36 --> 01:40:45.24 and to quote a j-p-taylor even served john French was supposed for some time to be a great military leader
01:40:47.72 --> 01:40:53.64 other views have been less charitable quote stupid obstinate blimps butchers
01:40:53.64 --> 01:40:59.64 ossified brains and donkeys are just a few of the unkind epitets which have been applied to those
01:40:59.64 --> 01:41:04.20 who bore upon their immaculate shoulders the responsibility of committing a generation of young
01:41:04.20 --> 01:41:11.08 men to various forms of mutilation on the battlefield a contemporary expression of this point of
01:41:11.08 --> 01:41:18.04 view puts it thus it is hard for a connoisseur of bad generalship surveying the gray ways of world war
01:41:18.04 --> 01:41:25.88 one to sink about anyone commander as especially awful there were dozens on both sides
01:41:25.88 --> 01:41:34.04 incompetence took several forms these included the implementation of a plan for the disposition
01:41:34.04 --> 01:41:38.68 of the British expeditionary force that had been devised three years before the outbreak of
01:41:38.68 --> 01:41:44.44 hostilities and remain unmodified in the light of subsequent events you said this on the last
01:41:44.44 --> 01:41:51.08 podcast Dave you're like oh machine gun oh they're shooting a machine gun at us stop everyone
01:41:51.08 --> 01:41:57.16 go back to the planning room that's how long it takes to figure that out we we receive a burst of
01:41:57.16 --> 01:42:01.48 machine gun fire and we go hey blow the whistles and stop and everyone go back to the
01:42:01.48 --> 01:42:14.84 church and we need to figure some shit out two a tenacious clinging to the age old practice
01:42:14.84 --> 01:42:22.92 of frontal assaults usually the enemies strongest points skipping had a little bit of three the
01:42:22.92 --> 01:42:29.32 underuse and misuse of available technology heigs opinion that two machine guns per battalion
01:42:29.32 --> 01:42:36.04 would be quite sufficient and the attitude of some reactionary elements to the development of tank
01:42:36.04 --> 01:42:41.16 of the tank are cases in point and you're we're going to get into some of that reactionary
01:42:41.16 --> 01:42:45.88 when when people figured out what the tank was I don't know if that's a good thing doesn't seem
01:42:45.88 --> 01:42:52.28 like a good idea for a growing belief in the value of prolonged bombardment before launching attack
01:42:53.24 --> 01:42:58.04 besides being enormously expensive such bombardments necessarily sacrificed the vital element of
01:42:58.04 --> 01:43:03.64 surprised made the intervening ground almost impossible to the subsequent assaulting infantry
01:43:03.64 --> 01:43:08.44 and provided numerous convenient craters to which the enemy machine gunners might be take
01:43:08.44 --> 01:43:14.44 themselves from their deep dugouts after the Holocaust was over there to wait the solely moving
01:43:14.44 --> 01:43:20.60 ranks of attacking infantry I had to detail that one because as I read that I was like hmm
01:43:20.60 --> 01:43:23.40 why is that bad right oh there's the reasons
01:43:26.92 --> 01:43:32.12 a tendency on the part of high command to ignore evidence which did not fit in with their wishes or
01:43:32.12 --> 01:43:42.12 preconceptions here's one that you might not anticipate number six a terrible crippling obedience
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.96 and man if I don't have to go over this over and over again with people you don't want
01:43:47.96 --> 01:43:55.64 subordinates that are just going to obey you don't want that there was even at the highest levels
01:43:55.64 --> 01:44:00.28 of command and attitude of mine so pathological and unrealistic that on occasions even army
01:44:00.28 --> 01:44:04.76 commanders dared not express their doubts about the viability of a particular order of venture
01:44:04.76 --> 01:44:09.96 preferring to conceal evidence from their superiors rather than be fought wanting and courage or loyalty
01:44:11.56 --> 01:44:16.60 it's better to say you forgot it thank you do yes sir we will go and assault that trench yes
01:44:19.88 --> 01:44:25.48 as ladel heart wrote of the third battle of e-praise it would seem that none of the army
01:44:25.48 --> 01:44:31.24 commanders ventured to press contrary views with the strength that the facts demanded one of the
01:44:31.24 --> 01:44:37.08 lessons of the war exemplified a passion dale is certainly the need of allowing more latitude
01:44:37.08 --> 01:44:45.08 in the military system for intellectual honesty and moral courage there's something very wrong
01:44:46.12 --> 01:44:53.96 in your organization if it requires moral courage to push back against the boss right I get it
01:44:53.96 --> 01:45:00.68 moral courage is important but if we have an organization and a culture where you only push back
01:45:00.68 --> 01:45:05.72 if you have tremendous moral courage that's freaking wrong yeah how much of a mismatch occurs in our
01:45:05.72 --> 01:45:10.28 relationship if it requires moral courage on my my part to ask you hard question said I go
01:45:10.28 --> 01:45:15.88 hey dude hey real quick and you're like yeah what's up yeah how much how much of a disconnect is
01:45:15.88 --> 01:45:22.28 there between you and me if I have to muster courage and face what is the reason that I'm being
01:45:22.28 --> 01:45:26.20 courageous because I'm afraid I have to deal with this anyway because there's fear involved what
01:45:26.20 --> 01:45:31.64 does that say about a relationship I'm afraid to say something and you you you talked about those
01:45:31.64 --> 01:45:37.40 ignoring of evidence and then the be the willingness to just agree with your leadership how convenient
01:45:37.40 --> 01:45:41.88 is it when the the thing you have to grapple with your own mind is well I'm not going to be there
01:45:41.88 --> 01:45:47.40 anyway I'm not going to be one of the leaders that gets mode down so this isn't nearly as hard
01:45:47.40 --> 01:45:52.04 for me as it would be if I'm like whoa hang on I have to be out in front of this assault that's a very
01:45:52.04 --> 01:45:56.68 different story than I have to send my men to go do this is there are two very different things
01:45:56.68 --> 01:46:02.36 yeah they they should be it should be worse should be worse should be thinking hey hold on a second
01:46:02.36 --> 01:46:08.52 Dave hold on a second sir I'm not sending my guys I'll go but I'm not sending my guys it should be
01:46:08.52 --> 01:46:14.92 the opposite but it's not and you know we talked about this a couple times and and you've referenced
01:46:14.92 --> 01:46:18.84 or well I mean it's really point for the book of this reference technology and and I made a
01:46:18.84 --> 01:46:24.68 little connection to my mind because a theme that keeps coming through here is is and I wrote down like
01:46:24.68 --> 01:46:29.72 disbelief of the evidence hey the evidence is showing you this you're like I cannot process
01:46:29.72 --> 01:46:34.28 process I can't process that so I'm I'm going to just I'm not going to accept it it's even a thing
01:46:34.28 --> 01:46:41.40 there's disbelief in that I I saw this when when we developed and the machine was the example
01:46:41.40 --> 01:46:45.88 we used last time but when we developed stealth technology and it really became evident to the
01:46:45.88 --> 01:46:50.28 world and desert storm because nobody really most people didn't really know is going on and all
01:46:50.28 --> 01:46:54.12 of a sudden first on a desert storm we're flying to the top of Baghdad with airplanes that nobody
01:46:54.12 --> 01:47:00.12 could see and there was a level of disbelief going on there from the Iraqi defense system
01:47:00.12 --> 01:47:05.88 as there's bombs going off around them like I hear I hear airplanes those are jet engines flying
01:47:05.88 --> 01:47:11.32 over her as I can't see them right here them things are blowing up but there was an incapacity
01:47:11.32 --> 01:47:18.36 to to accept that he was happening because they didn't see it and this doesn't exist well
01:47:18.92 --> 01:47:23.24 unfortunately one of the byproducts of that was some people were paying attention to that and
01:47:23.24 --> 01:47:28.12 there's this massive shift from the early 90s to building stealth airplanes we have a bunch of them
01:47:28.12 --> 01:47:33.24 now guess who else has the rush in the Chinese are you know our primary enemies but
01:47:33.80 --> 01:47:39.000 the idea of being in a fight was something you can't see which is what's one of the things that
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.60 stealth allows you to do is one of the most common things that you see when you're in the
01:47:42.60 --> 01:47:47.72 stair there plane is other people behaving as if you're not there when they know you're there
01:47:47.72 --> 01:47:51.56 they just can't see you and like well I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing like
01:47:52.28 --> 01:48:00.44 good lord you were just going to allow things to unfold because you cannot you cannot come to grips
01:48:00.44 --> 01:48:04.52 with what is happening even though I know it's the wrong choice of words even though you know
01:48:04.52 --> 01:48:08.60 what's happening and that machine gun example is probably the best real-time example of
01:48:09.48 --> 01:48:14.68 there's a machine gun in shot of us I know but we're just going to keep going down this path
01:48:14.68 --> 01:48:19.96 we're going to get to a single four in the second world war and when single four goes down the
01:48:20.76 --> 01:48:27.08 the Japanese attack with their aircraft and it's a night attack and there's like a 30 minute warning
01:48:27.96 --> 01:48:33.08 of hey there's an enemy inbound and a bunch of the leaders were like no the Japanese don't attack
01:48:33.08 --> 01:48:37.80 a night they didn't do anything they didn't launch aircraft they didn't do anything they just sat there
01:48:37.80 --> 01:48:41.24 like oh no that's no the enemy the Japanese don't attack they don't fly their aircraft
01:48:41.24 --> 01:48:44.76 a night it's not them it's not happening it's exactly what you're saying it's exactly the same thing
01:48:44.76 --> 01:48:51.96 this isn't happening this isn't happening yeah a detachment from reality
01:48:52.84 --> 01:48:56.52 is not good the kind of detachment we don't like I think it's the one kind of detachment I don't
01:48:56.52 --> 01:49:01.56 like detachment from reality and number seven a readiness to accept enormous casualties in terms of
01:49:01.56 --> 01:49:06.44 number of lives lost relative the ground gained the the actions of the first World War make
01:49:06.44 --> 01:49:12.04 dismal reading in the first two hours the battle of lose we lost more men than were last lost
01:49:12.04 --> 01:49:19.16 by all services together in the whole of D day on 1944 that's two hours on the first day of the
01:49:19.16 --> 01:49:27.48 Psalm offensive the British army suffered 57,000 casualties on the first day the biggest loss
01:49:27.48 --> 01:49:33.96 ever suffered by any army in a single day and yet as one of the story has put it to see the ground
01:49:33.96 --> 01:49:47.000 gained one needs a magnifying glass and a simpler scale map the we he'll cover some of the
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.64 World War one stuff but it's a pretty brief as I said in the beginning today as he goes into
01:49:53.64 --> 01:49:59.16 more well known events like World War one he doesn't go into his much detail because we already know
01:49:59.16 --> 01:50:06.68 about it but he does go into some detail this next chapter is about a cambrae which there is a battle
01:50:06.68 --> 01:50:12.36 of cambrae and it's the really the first the first tank battle where tanks were used
01:50:14.68 --> 01:50:21.000 and this is just so important because there's so much resistance here in 1912 a private civilian
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:28.44 inventor e l demol of Adelaide presented the war office with the design for a tracked vehicle
01:50:28.44 --> 01:50:33.32 which to put it at its simplest would help solve the major tactical problem of the first World
01:50:33.32 --> 01:50:38.12 War which hadn't even started yet how to get soldiers across no manland, barbed wire and enemy
01:50:38.12 --> 01:50:44.20 trenches without being shot the war office looked at demol's design and laid it on its on one side
01:50:44.20 --> 01:50:48.92 and 1915 through a total lack of personal protection British soldiers on the western front
01:50:48.92 --> 01:50:55.64 were dying at the rate of thousands a day demol was moved to resubmit his invention again it was ignored
01:50:59.08 --> 01:51:03.24 and by the way he didn't come up with this idea four runners of the tank can be traced back to
01:51:03.24 --> 01:51:08.20 Caesar's invasion of Britain Leonardo da Vinci had designed an armored fighting vehicle in the
01:51:08.20 --> 01:51:14.60 16th century and the concept was advanced by H. G. Wells in his book the land iron clads
01:51:14.60 --> 01:51:22.20 polished in 1903 remember when I was a kid I saw that you know a road of enchanting I was pretty
01:51:22.20 --> 01:51:28.20 stoked on that it might be concluded therefore that his invention was put aside not just because
01:51:28.20 --> 01:51:33.24 it was a new idea which it was not nor because it was not needed which it was but because it
01:51:33.24 --> 01:51:39.88 conflicted with a mystical belief and the virtues of horse to cavalry and in the power of a prolonged
01:51:39.88 --> 01:51:49.96 military barrage now we get into some of the politics that was going on about the tanks while
01:51:49.96 --> 01:51:56.76 Churchill and Lloyd George were enthusiastic supporters of the tanks master general of ordinance
01:51:56.76 --> 01:52:03.64 general von Donop remained implacably opposed to any such development in the services the major
01:52:03.64 --> 01:52:07.80 proponents of the tank development included ironically a small group of naval officers
01:52:07.80 --> 01:52:14.28 the fact that the admiral to felt less quote threatened by tanks than the war office did
01:52:14.28 --> 01:52:18.92 was strikingly illustrated at one of those demonstrations where in proponents of a new idea
01:52:20.20 --> 01:52:27.80 strive to convert skeptics by confrontation with evidence of their senses after an impeccable display
01:52:27.80 --> 01:52:33.40 in which prototype tanks cut through barbed wire cross-chinch trenches slithered through mud and
01:52:33.40 --> 01:52:39.56 clawed their way out of craters a naval officer was heard to remark we ought to order 3,000 now
01:52:39.56 --> 01:52:45.96 so the navy guys like hey bro that looks like a pretty freaking good thing but the war office contingent
01:52:45.96 --> 01:52:51.08 remained cool once senior general retorting who is this damn naval man saying we will want
01:52:51.08 --> 01:52:56.44 3,000 tanks he talks like Napoleon him and his detached point of view
01:52:56.44 --> 01:53:05.32 um they get some tanks they get some of them they use him in battle
01:53:06.44 --> 01:53:09.96 and and here's what happens of course how do they use him about this is like when you learn
01:53:09.96 --> 01:53:15.32 an eugenia to move like hey echo you know here's this new move and I teach you the
01:53:15.32 --> 01:53:21.32 freaking whatever some armlock variation you go try it for the first time how does it work
01:53:21.32 --> 01:53:28.92 not that it doesn't work so you're like oh I'm never using this again similar activities here
01:53:28.92 --> 01:53:35.24 the small cooper cooper writes the small part played by the tanks however successful on the local
01:53:35.24 --> 01:53:40.20 scale was overlooked in the general sense of failure doubts which many staff officers had previously
01:53:40.20 --> 01:53:45.96 expressed as the value of tanks turned to scorn instead of trying to plan an intelligent use of
01:53:45.96 --> 01:53:51.000 the superior weapon that had been put in their hands the military leaders could only make minor
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.20 criticisms of minor details you don't jokers or mock i was totally off battle you know whatever
01:53:57.72 --> 01:54:01.08 instead of you saying hey you know i need to make some adjustments the way i'm employing this
01:54:01.08 --> 01:54:04.68 can you help me instead you just go do them not not your you move socks
01:54:07.08 --> 01:54:11.08 don't you let me you always say how when you implement anything new yes kind of
01:54:11.08 --> 01:54:15.80 lose efficiency it's the first thing that happens you become less bad happens all the time
01:54:15.80 --> 01:54:20.60 to me and you did to some new move that i'm starting to work i get smashed by everyone oh yeah
01:54:20.60 --> 01:54:25.96 and you're even it jams up other parts of your game totally because you're thinking way more
01:54:25.96 --> 01:54:31.32 way less than than you would and then yeah just be like oh yeah jiu jitsu sucks now yeah or
01:54:31.32 --> 01:54:36.52 that messed up my game that whole part of my game is not not not doing that anymore
01:54:39.72 --> 01:54:44.12 fast forward a little bit frustrated by failure and unable to admit their own contributions to
01:54:44.12 --> 01:54:47.80 defeat by the way when they lost this battle when they used tanks for the first time what was the
01:54:47.80 --> 01:54:51.96 problem oh it was the tanks there wasn't anything that they didn't mistake that they made
01:54:52.44 --> 01:54:57.000 they did what all what the highly prejudice do and such a circumstance vented their feelings upon
01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.24 the original subject of their prejudice and in doing so precluded any chance of learning from
01:55:01.24 --> 01:55:09.80 the exercise fast forward a little bit meanwhile the futile third battle of
01:55:09.80 --> 01:55:15.96 e-brays continue to consume the lives of intramu in infantrymen at the rate of more than 2000
01:55:15.96 --> 01:55:24.44 a day never to last the general headquarters blame the waste of life upon the few tanks that
01:55:24.44 --> 01:55:30.52 had been used i mean this is pretty can't make this shit up it seems they they disappeared into
01:55:30.52 --> 01:55:36.36 the model along with everything else now here we get to this chapter something the cam bri
01:55:36.36 --> 01:55:42.36 cam bri tank offensive on November 20th 1917 occurred in three stages the first was
01:55:42.36 --> 01:55:47.72 eminently successful 380 tanks operating on ground suited to caterpillar tracks achieved to
01:55:47.72 --> 01:55:52.60 suspect a killer success over running three strongly held lines of enemy trenches
01:55:53.16 --> 01:55:59.96 whereas previous offenses had been measured in yards gained for tens of thousands of lives lost
01:55:59.96 --> 01:56:07.24 the cam bri offense advance was four and a half miles on a six mile front with negligible casualties
01:56:07.24 --> 01:56:14.44 so there you go they freaking use the tank they're like hell yeah this worked but if the first phase
01:56:14.44 --> 01:56:19.80 first stage was an unprecedented victory the second showed a beginning of the rot which was
01:56:19.80 --> 01:56:26.28 to turn victory into disaster there were various contributary factors the first was general
01:56:26.28 --> 01:56:31.40 harpur whose 50 first highland division had been given the task of capturing key objectives
01:56:31.40 --> 01:56:38.36 in the center of the attack the village of flesky rays sorry everybody about high pronunciation
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.08 unfortunately harpur who'd been described as a quote a narrow-minded soldier of the old school
01:56:45.08 --> 01:56:50.52 was one of those who disapproved of tanks consequently not only were his troops given little training
01:56:50.52 --> 01:56:55.72 in working with the new weapon but they were instructed in tactics contrary to those recommended
01:56:55.72 --> 01:57:01.16 by the tank corps even worse harpur delayed his assault by one hour because he did not believe
01:57:01.16 --> 01:57:06.60 that the first objective the hindburg main line would be captured so quickly so this guy's just a
01:57:06.60 --> 01:57:11.88 hater out of the gate can you imagine you get a tank and you're like hey I'm not going to get my
01:57:11.88 --> 01:57:17.72 people proper training on it the unnecessary delay allowed the Germans in an hour
01:57:18.76 --> 01:57:26.60 allowed the Germans an hour in which to bring up and sight field guns on the ridge here in one
01:57:26.60 --> 01:57:32.12 here's one description of what followed the tanks continued blifely onto the crest of the ridge
01:57:32.12 --> 01:57:38.20 in line of rest as instructed they came to the top huge dark shapes silhouetted against the
01:57:38.20 --> 01:57:44.28 skyline and there before them were the German field guns had the infantry been close behind the
01:57:44.28 --> 01:57:49.32 tanks as fuller had planned they could have easily dealt with these guns in a matter of minutes
01:57:49.32 --> 01:57:54.68 but the infantry were far behind not only held up by having to find their way through the wire
01:57:54.68 --> 01:58:00.04 but because of the machine gun fire which was causing heavy casualties the tanks were on their own
01:58:00.04 --> 01:58:06.04 with such perfect targets the German gunners opened fire one by one the tanks were hit while the
01:58:06.04 --> 01:58:11.96 crews worked desperately at the cumbersome gears to drive a zigzag course and the gunners tried to
01:58:11.96 --> 01:58:17.24 return fire but taking accurate aim in all the pitching and tossing was virtually impossible
01:58:17.24 --> 01:58:22.12 it was some minutes before the German guns had been pulled out of action but by this time
01:58:22.12 --> 01:58:28.44 16 tanks had been destroyed with huge gaping holes in their sides most were on fire and those
01:58:28.44 --> 01:58:32.52 crew members who had not been killed outright by the blasting shells were burned to death
01:58:34.04 --> 01:58:35.24 there were no survivors
01:58:44.52 --> 01:58:49.56 through a pious fast forward through a pious and mistaken belief in the value of horse cavalry
01:58:49.56 --> 01:58:55.24 and a paralysis thought a case by years of trench warfare the brilliant breakthrough by the tanks
01:58:55.24 --> 01:58:59.96 was thrown away some ten days later the Germans counterattacked in a matter of hours they recovered
01:58:59.96 --> 01:59:05.32 much of the ground originally lost the British third army commanded by general Sir Julian
01:59:05.32 --> 01:59:11.88 being lost 6,000 men taken prisoner some thousands killed or wounded and a vast quantity of guns
01:59:11.88 --> 01:59:17.72 and other equipment the magnitude of this disaster was directly attributable to a feature of
01:59:17.72 --> 01:59:22.92 high-level military incompetence seen all too often the ignoring of intelligence reports which
01:59:22.92 --> 01:59:25.08 did not fit in with the preconceived ideas
01:59:29.96 --> 01:59:35.56 when at last news of the disaster reached Britain it was naturally assumed that the generals had failed
01:59:35.56 --> 01:59:41.96 again heg's reputation already low sank to a vanishing point the war cabinet demanded an immediate
01:59:41.96 --> 01:59:48.20 explanation heg's response was to endorse a report from general being that the third army had not
01:59:48.20 --> 01:59:52.20 been taken by surprise and that the failure to stem the German breakthrough was due to the
01:59:52.20 --> 01:59:56.84 shortcomings of those junior officers and CEOs and men who had been involved in the fighting
01:59:59.16 --> 02:00:06.84 what a freaking savage in the face of so much contrary evidence these views did not impress the
02:00:06.84 --> 02:00:16.60 critics to stifle further debate the war cabinet called in general smuts and this freaking savage
02:00:17.64 --> 02:00:23.48 smut stated and they go into what his relationships are he's he's just a just a real
02:00:23.48 --> 02:00:29.72 piece of shit smut stated higher command army or court command were not to blame everything had
02:00:29.72 --> 02:00:34.52 been done to meet such an attack he went on to say that the fault lay either with local
02:00:34.52 --> 02:00:39.40 commanders who might have lost their heads or with those lower down junior officers and CEOs and men
02:00:39.40 --> 02:00:44.44 of those two alternatives he preferred the latter explanation and so smuts in the fashion of the day
02:00:44.44 --> 02:00:53.96 blame those least able to answer back the youthful the junior and the dead again what
02:00:53.96 --> 02:00:57.48 corrections are we now making we're not making any corrections we're like oh yeah as the team's fault
02:00:57.48 --> 02:01:07.000 and by the way the team who fought with bravery that is unquestionable all in all this black
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.68 episode raises several matters of great rebel relevance to the theory of military and
02:01:12.68 --> 02:01:17.40 competence presented later in this book stupidity does not explain the behavior of these generals
02:01:18.52 --> 02:01:24.92 so great was their fear of loss of self esteem and so imperative their need for social
02:01:24.92 --> 02:01:31.16 approval approval that they could resort to tactics beyond the reach of any self-respecting donkey
02:01:32.60 --> 02:01:38.28 from their shameless self-interest lack of loyalty to their subordinates and apparent in
02:01:38.28 --> 02:01:44.20 difference to the verdict of pro posterity a picture emerges of personalities deficient in
02:01:44.20 --> 02:01:53.000 something other than intellectual acumen so can these people aren't stupid how about that phrase
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:59.08 a lack of loyalty to your subordinates and how often we fall into the idea like that's supposed
02:01:59.08 --> 02:02:04.04 to work the opposite direction they should be loyal to me because i'm in charge i'm the commander
02:02:04.04 --> 02:02:08.52 and it's the lack of loyalty to your subordinates as the cause of why this happens
02:02:09.96 --> 02:02:17.24 sickening as to how they look to a contemporary chronicle here is the following passage
02:02:17.24 --> 02:02:23.96 and so the white washing went on to protect armchair generals who in the main have little
02:02:23.96 --> 02:02:28.68 conception of what the front line was like and had no intention of going there to find out one
02:02:28.68 --> 02:02:36.04 of those infantry men so blamed was jh Everest during the two days when he and his fellow soldiers were
02:02:36.04 --> 02:02:40.44 being pushed back by the Germans they had no water to drink and no food to eat at the end of the
02:02:40.44 --> 02:02:45.24 second day while waiting in a transfer renewed attack Everest went up to his company commander and
02:02:45.24 --> 02:02:51.56 asked for permission to search for water my request was refused Everest wrote in the letter
02:02:51.56 --> 02:02:56.76 nonetheless i went over the top and found some water in a mud hole thus ending two days of torture
02:02:57.88 --> 02:03:02.84 shortly afterwards Everest was wounded and found himself in the australian general hospital at abbey
02:03:02.84 --> 02:03:10.04 ville but the most bitter pill on top of this was to be blamed for their commanders own mistakes
02:03:10.04 --> 02:03:18.20 you imagine reading those freaking articles about how jacked up you were
02:03:26.20 --> 02:03:31.72 another world war one example here chapter eight the siege of cut
02:03:33.48 --> 02:03:37.40 if the degree of military incompetence is indicated by the ratio of achievement to cost
02:03:37.40 --> 02:03:44.44 then the activities of expeditionary force d under the command of major general surchalls
02:03:44.44 --> 02:03:50.44 towns and merit examination firstly there was a 250 mile discrepancy between what was designed
02:03:50.44 --> 02:03:55.08 to do and what it tried to do secondly the cost of this discrepancy was large
02:03:56.12 --> 02:04:01.48 to reach cut cost towns in seven thousand casualties during the ensuing siege of further
02:04:01.48 --> 02:04:07.88 1600 died attempts to relieve his force accounted for another 23 thousand casualties
02:04:07.88 --> 02:04:12.28 when he eventually surrendered to the Turks 13 thousand of his troops went into captivity
02:04:12.28 --> 02:04:19.56 and seven thousand of these died while still prisoners of war all of this went for nothing
02:04:19.56 --> 02:04:24.44 not one inch of ground or any political advantage nothing that is beyond corpses suffering
02:04:24.44 --> 02:04:34.52 and ruined reputation so you have this this take place this is an Iraq
02:04:35.88 --> 02:04:41.56 in Mesopotamia i mean this is I guess current day Iraq in Mesopotamia there were
02:04:41.56 --> 02:04:47.40 four enemies the Turkish army marauding Arabs the terrain and the climate all four
02:04:47.40 --> 02:04:51.40 played their part in hazarding the lines of communication and bringing about into feet which cost
02:04:51.40 --> 02:04:57.64 much and gain nothing but the real instigators of this tragedy were neither the climate nor geography
02:04:57.64 --> 02:05:05.72 neither the Turks nor the Arabs but three generals general bowshomp death commander in chief
02:05:05.72 --> 02:05:10.76 india general nixon army commander bazaarah and major general towns in commander of the sixth
02:05:10.76 --> 02:05:17.56 division through an admixture of self-interest personal ambition ignorance,
02:05:17.56 --> 02:05:22.84 obscenity and sheer craft to pity this trio sealed the fate of some thousands of British
02:05:22.84 --> 02:05:30.60 and Indian soldiers i kind of wanted to fast forward through this part but
02:05:31.88 --> 02:05:34.92 this one is insane
02:05:36.84 --> 02:05:41.000 nixon who made up an ambition for what he lacked for an intelligence ordered towns in a
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:46.28 capture amara a township on the Tigris some hundred miles north of bazaar towns in
02:05:46.28 --> 02:05:52.20 equally ambitious but by no means stupid did is as he was bit and doing so he and nixon were
02:05:52.20 --> 02:05:56.84 already exceeding the directive of the British government so they're kind of pushing the envelope down
02:05:56.84 --> 02:06:04.60 there little glory see can happening as well as occupying amara towns in struck westward and took
02:06:04.60 --> 02:06:11.64 nausea ria nixon's appetite for glory was wedded by these easy victories with no thought to the
02:06:11.64 --> 02:06:18.84 risks involved he pressed towns into continuous advance a further 90 miles to cut in this he was
02:06:18.84 --> 02:06:24.12 backed by duff who had never visited messin patini and tanya and had no idea of the conditions
02:06:24.12 --> 02:06:31.72 prevailing there but towns in had he wrote to general sir James wolf mary in England
02:06:33.08 --> 02:06:39.96 by the way towns in is about to become a villain he of horror that you've likely can't even
02:06:39.96 --> 02:06:47.24 understand I believe this is this so this is towns in runnyback I believe I am to advance to amara
02:06:47.24 --> 02:06:53.80 to cut to l amara the question is where are we going to stop in messa patini so this is sounds good
02:06:53.80 --> 02:06:59.48 right okay where are you second dude what are we trying to do we certainly have not good enough
02:06:59.48 --> 02:07:06.04 troops to make certain of of taking bad debt Baghdad of our two divisions mine the sixth is complete
02:07:06.04 --> 02:07:13.80 the 12 has no guns or divisional troops and nixon takes them from me and lends him to gornion
02:07:13.80 --> 02:07:19.08 when he has to go anywhere I consider we ought to hold on to what we've got as long as we are held
02:07:19.08 --> 02:07:26.12 up as we are in the dardinels all these offensive operations in secondary theaters are dreadful
02:07:26.12 --> 02:07:31.96 errors in strategy the dardinels egypt messa patini a east africa i wonder and wonder at such
02:07:31.96 --> 02:07:35.96 expeditions being permitted in violation of all great fundamental principles of four especially
02:07:35.96 --> 02:07:39.40 the out of economy of force such as the violation is always punished in history so he's
02:07:39.40 --> 02:07:44.92 any got to prioritize next week why we do run around doing all these different things i'm afraid
02:07:44.92 --> 02:07:50.04 we are out in the cold here the messa patini and operations are a little noticed though we are
02:07:50.04 --> 02:07:54.76 fighting the same enemy as you have in the dardinels plus and appalling heat the hardship in
02:07:54.76 --> 02:08:02.04 France or nothing to that so this seems like a logical thing right towns like hey dude what are we doing
02:08:02.04 --> 02:08:05.96 like we already kind of got done or supposed to get done why are you pushing further let's hold
02:08:05.96 --> 02:08:09.48 what we got i don't have a bunch of troops i'm getting my my troops are getting pulled all over
02:08:09.48 --> 02:08:17.72 the place let's just kind of stand down but it's an interesting um there's another uh story in
02:08:17.72 --> 02:08:22.60 that writes the letter was completely in character it revealed a gift for strategic appreciation amounting
02:08:22.60 --> 02:08:29.16 to uh prescience it revealed towns in chronic tendency to criticize his superiors and his obsession
02:08:29.16 --> 02:08:33.16 with his own affairs to the exclusion of all others it revealed as a bit you will lack of general
02:08:33.16 --> 02:08:38.52 of generosity to his colleagues who whom he praised only if they were of inferior rank to himself
02:08:38.52 --> 02:08:45.16 his tendency to wine and almost embarrassing immodesty i think that's a hard reading of that letter i
02:08:45.16 --> 02:08:50.92 i think that's a little bit strong uh but the most extraordinary feature in the letter was that
02:08:50.92 --> 02:08:56.20 for all its strategic prescience it bore little relationship to towns and subsequent behavior i guess
02:08:56.20 --> 02:09:01.000 that's what makes it interesting though he clearly realized that he was being asked to undertake
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.20 a major campaign with the logistics of a subsidiary defensive operation he said nothing of this
02:09:06.20 --> 02:09:11.08 to his superiors 17 days after writing to Murray towns and not only enthusiastically accepted
02:09:11.08 --> 02:09:17.56 Nixon's orders that he should advance a further 90 miles to cut but also entirely of his own bat
02:09:17.56 --> 02:09:23.16 talked of pursuing the enemy another 190 miles and possibly beyond that to Baghdad
02:09:26.44 --> 02:09:32.76 indisputably he was a man ambitious to the point of ego mania man whom the lower of promotion
02:09:32.76 --> 02:09:38.28 had goaded throughout his career to such an incest and intriguing and important it lighter writing
02:09:38.28 --> 02:09:45.56 that he'd incurred constant snubbing and rebuked yet he had persisted to such a man the smallest
02:09:45.56 --> 02:09:53.72 hint of condemnation seems enthusiastic approval closing his mind to to his own for
02:09:53.72 --> 02:09:59.000 buildings towns and his unsuspecting troops pressed on once again the Turks were defeated
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.28 and the British occupied cut so they do they press into cut but this battle's not easy because
02:10:04.28 --> 02:10:10.52 remember i said those earlier battles were kind of easy at cut it's not easy and the it's not easy
02:10:10.52 --> 02:10:16.84 for towns and troops is not easy for the the Turks either says about the Turks the Turks
02:10:16.84 --> 02:10:22.84 though suffering many casualties they were not destroyed they escaped and then they were the British
02:10:22.84 --> 02:10:26.20 wounded here's what's going on with the British wounded the wounded suffered frightfully
02:10:26.20 --> 02:10:31.64 untended they lay freezing all night some to be stripped and murdered by Arabs and when daylight
02:10:31.64 --> 02:10:36.76 came were placed on supply carts unsprung iron slatted and drawn across a cruelly uneven surface
02:10:36.76 --> 02:10:41.16 to the riverbank there and fearsome they languished until they could be crammed on the decks of iron
02:10:41.16 --> 02:10:49.48 barges and towed very slowly downstream to amoura what little water they were given was impure
02:10:49.48 --> 02:10:53.40 what little treatment they could be given was ineffective their wounds went gangrene
02:10:54.36 --> 02:11:00.76 and they lay in a morass of their own blood and extra and excreta a sailed by millions of flies
02:11:00.76 --> 02:11:13.16 quite unnecessarily many of them died now towns and they also say this for another he was
02:11:13.16 --> 02:11:18.28 despite his appraisal of realities loath to relinquish his own dream of becoming lieutenant general
02:11:18.28 --> 02:11:25.56 serial towns and lord Baghdad and so grossly unequipped he marched his men beyond the point of no return
02:11:25.56 --> 02:11:33.48 towards Baghdad he never reached that fabled city for a army of 13,000 Turks lay across his path
02:11:34.76 --> 02:11:38.92 Nixon received Nixon received intelligence that a second Turkish army 30,000 strong
02:11:39.88 --> 02:11:46.20 and led by the redoutable calil pascha was also converging but because this news did not
02:11:46.20 --> 02:11:51.88 accord with his desires Nixon chose to ignore the report is untrue 30,000 people heading to take
02:11:51.88 --> 02:12:02.28 on your whatever you have 12,000 the battle marked the end of towns in sluck through his conduct
02:12:02.28 --> 02:12:07.32 though his conduct of the fight was exemplary if not brilliant he sustained 4,000 casualties
02:12:07.32 --> 02:12:12.12 and again did not succeed in routing or destroying the enemy he withdrew his force to cut
02:12:12.84 --> 02:12:19.72 cut which he knew to be without defense so this this town of cut is not like a really great
02:12:19.72 --> 02:12:25.64 defensive position and towns and knows it towns and new found delusion regarding the virtues of cut
02:12:25.64 --> 02:12:33.72 may well have had its origins in a much earlier event the siege of shetrawl when intractable
02:12:33.72 --> 02:12:38.36 desires are thwarted by reality there is a tendency to hark back to the memory of early earlier
02:12:38.36 --> 02:12:44.92 gratifications and shetrawl epitomized for towns and just such gratification here so this is towns
02:12:44.92 --> 02:12:51.32 and as a young officer of the indian army he had withdrawn into a fort and and captain his
02:12:51.32 --> 02:12:57.88 small force throughout 46 days of siege when eventually he did emerge it was to find himself a hero
02:12:58.84 --> 02:13:03.24 beloved by queen in country so that's what happened to him as a young officer he goes into this
02:13:03.24 --> 02:13:08.76 place they look and locked down and they hold out for 46 days so now he's going to do the same thing
02:13:08.76 --> 02:13:15.48 at cut that's his plan you can now overlook the shortcomings of cut and see in his smelly collection
02:13:15.48 --> 02:13:22.52 of mudhuts the key to ultimate success another inconsistency in towns and behaviors that he had
02:13:22.52 --> 02:13:27.32 always prided himself upon the fact that he drew upon the lessons of history identifying himself
02:13:27.32 --> 02:13:33.64 as the occasion demanded with such great captains this animal Napoleon and Wellington but we joke about
02:13:33.64 --> 02:13:40.52 that when you think you're freaking Wellington or Hannibal or Napoleon there was nothing he liked
02:13:40.52 --> 02:13:45.24 better than to quote the precepts of famous military commanders to such precepts were to make wars
02:13:45.24 --> 02:13:51.16 to attack and movement as the law of strategy but here was towns and towns and as heedless of
02:13:51.16 --> 02:13:56.60 Frederick the Great as he was death to the council of Marshall Fark for the bottle himself up in
02:13:56.60 --> 02:14:01.16 cut was to assume a positive defense as stationary as was passive so why is he doing this?
02:14:01.16 --> 02:14:05.72 Well he's doing it because he remembers that he had the big victory back in the day
02:14:07.96 --> 02:14:11.64 and it was unnecessary for there was still time to fall back on the safety of ours so he could have
02:14:11.64 --> 02:14:17.32 still made it out of there that he did not do so cannot be ascribed as stupidity or to ignorance
02:14:17.32 --> 02:14:21.16 of the principles of war for towns and was neither stupid nor ignorant his first move toward
02:14:21.16 --> 02:14:27.16 hastening his rescue was so was so to manipulate his would be rescuers so they felt compelled to
02:14:27.16 --> 02:14:31.48 try and relieve the siege before they were ready thus he persuaded his army commander at Balsra that
02:14:31.48 --> 02:14:36.92 since he had only a month supply of food for his British troops and early relief was essential
02:14:36.92 --> 02:14:41.56 to sustain this lie and force Nixon's hand he deliberately refrained from rationing either as
02:14:41.56 --> 02:14:46.28 British or Indian troops nor did he make any attempt to unearth the stocks of Arab grain concealed
02:14:46.28 --> 02:14:49.72 within the town so he's out of the gate he's just telling lies hey you better get him coming
02:14:49.72 --> 02:14:58.52 us before someone run out of food just a freaking lie well does Nixon do well Nixon trying to help out
02:14:58.52 --> 02:15:01.88 okay do you don't want my people to starve Nixon ordered the unfortunate lieutenant general
02:15:02.92 --> 02:15:10.04 ailmer to break through the Turkish defense forces and relieve cut there's a whole section on
02:15:10.04 --> 02:15:14.84 here talking about how that goes down ailmer failed time and time again to achieve the impossible
02:15:14.84 --> 02:15:19.08 thanks to the combined efforts of the man he was trying to rescue and those of Nixon the man
02:15:19.08 --> 02:15:26.36 large the man largely responsible for rescue being necessary the relief force suffered 23,000 casualties
02:15:26.36 --> 02:15:33.64 nearly twice the number of those invested so this guy tells lies they're like hey we need to
02:15:33.64 --> 02:15:39.40 go help them we're not ready yet but just run in there anyways and they take freaking 23,000 casualties
02:15:39.40 --> 02:15:42.44 more than they try to say a 12 yeah double the people that are in there
02:15:42.44 --> 02:15:53.56 remember I think it was a debrief podcast we talked about you talked about you made a list
02:15:53.56 --> 02:15:59.48 of things that keep you from being successful in the future and one of them was lessons learned
02:15:59.48 --> 02:16:04.84 yeah you always liked that one I did because it was something I didn't expect it the way and
02:16:04.84 --> 02:16:09.24 not just the way you were going through the list because the list was like obvious ones or or
02:16:09.24 --> 02:16:15.40 let me say that more carefully what appeared to be obvious ones and you got to that and it's so easy
02:16:15.40 --> 02:16:20.44 now once I've heard you say it to just transpose that idea of lessons learned actually if you're
02:16:21.08 --> 02:16:27.48 and you didn't say don't take lessons learned of course not but they can be an impediment especially
02:16:27.48 --> 02:16:34.52 if like the paradigm or the scenario with which that lesson was learned doesn't actually apply
02:16:34.52 --> 02:16:39.08 to the scenario that you're in but it's not the same city well must be the same situation cool
02:16:39.08 --> 02:16:43.40 we'll just take that and we'll just I did this back in the day when I was 23 and I was a hero
02:16:44.12 --> 02:16:49.08 watch this and of course it's easy to see now because I'm sitting in a detached position but
02:16:52.44 --> 02:16:58.36 you wrote down I wrote down you said it delusion disbelief and desire
02:16:58.36 --> 02:17:07.08 God bless hearing that the Lord how bad and if that third one might be the worst one of like
02:17:07.08 --> 02:17:11.72 I want to be a hero I want to be what do they call himself the king of a Baghdad or
02:17:11.72 --> 02:17:17.24 king of Baghdad or whatever yeah that desire and go we're losing no we're not
02:17:17.24 --> 02:17:21.72 hairlatt number no we're not hey we shouldn't do this yes we should because you know what I want
02:17:21.72 --> 02:17:28.20 I want to be the king of Baghdad for you can discover easy man the thing about lessons
02:17:28.20 --> 02:17:37.32 learned lessons learned should open your mind not close your mind these guys are lying by the way
02:17:37.32 --> 02:17:43.56 secretary of state for indian army commander Bosra Joseph Chamberlain cable this statement
02:17:43.56 --> 02:17:50.76 honor rival wounded honor rival wounded Bosra please telegraph urgently particulars and progress
02:17:50.76 --> 02:17:55.56 so this guy's saying hey what's going on with the wounded you got and Nixon replies wounded
02:17:55.56 --> 02:18:00.84 satisfactory the disposed of many likely to recover medical services under circumstances of
02:18:00.84 --> 02:18:09.80 considerable difficulty worked splendidly but Nixon to admit for you just witnessed the arrival of
02:18:09.80 --> 02:18:36.84 4,000 and the the mejade which is a ship with 600 casualties on board and two crammed
02:18:36.84 --> 02:18:43.08 13 days and nights on her decks and on the exposed decks of her lighters men lay huddled in pools of
02:18:43.08 --> 02:18:49.32 blood urine and feces their bodies slime with excrement their wounds crawling with maggots their
02:18:49.32 --> 02:18:54.44 shattered bones splinted wood from whiskey crates and the handles of trenching tools and their
02:18:54.44 --> 02:19:08.12 thighs backs and buttocks lepros with source i mean while towns and he's got his guys safely
02:19:08.12 --> 02:19:12.68 up and cut it well all this is happening these guys are getting slaughter 23,000 casualties
02:19:13.32 --> 02:19:21.08 and towns ends up their kind of chilling over the period of the siege he evaded he
02:19:21.08 --> 02:19:27.64 evenced several characteristics it towns and communications were not however confined to those outside
02:19:27.64 --> 02:19:32.36 cut during the siege he had devoted much attention to issuing of communicates to his troops
02:19:32.36 --> 02:19:36.04 these were remarkable for three features a flagrant to soil t-tourds
02:19:36.84 --> 02:19:41.80 towards and criticism of his superiors of thinly veiled contempt for the valiant but unsuccessful
02:19:41.80 --> 02:19:46.44 relief force and a total absence of gratitude toward those who are losing their lives trying to
02:19:46.44 --> 02:19:55.08 rescue him towns and was always prepared to abandon his beloved command in the interest of
02:19:55.08 --> 02:20:01.72 either his own release or his own advancement on March 5th he had again requested promotion
02:20:02.84 --> 02:20:05.80 this guy's calling he's captured he's freaking
02:20:06.60 --> 02:20:11.32 in siege after causing himself to be there he's asking him to promote it on April 9th for the
02:20:11.32 --> 02:20:15.72 second time he had suggested that he should attempt escape to escape from caught and leave his
02:20:15.72 --> 02:20:21.40 division to its fate you imagine running that up the chain of command hey boss I'm good
02:20:21.40 --> 02:20:24.60 I think I should just try and get out of here and whatever happens with the division kind of happens with
02:20:24.60 --> 02:20:31.56 the division three times he had suggested negotiation to exchange caught and it's guns for the release
02:20:31.56 --> 02:20:36.28 of himself and his men though he must have known that only he would be allowed to go twice he had
02:20:36.28 --> 02:20:41.64 sent ingratiating letters to the enemy commander in the field and once had insisted that no attempt
02:20:41.64 --> 02:20:50.20 be made on the life of an enemy field marshal any doubts to the correct interpretation of these
02:20:50.20 --> 02:20:55.64 unedifying facts are dispelled by three subsequent events the first is a minor one but nonetheless
02:20:55.64 --> 02:21:01.64 revealing when towns had learned that that ale mayor's successor Garringe had been promoted to
02:21:01.64 --> 02:21:07.64 Lieutenant General he burst into tears and wept on the shoulder of a shrinking subaltern
02:21:07.64 --> 02:21:14.68 because he knew that Garringe's promotion meant none for him the second is the fact
02:21:15.56 --> 02:21:21.64 that he did leave his division to die as prisoners of the Turks and the third is that neither
02:21:21.64 --> 02:21:27.40 then nor later did he so much as left a finger to ameliorate their plight for a present
02:21:27.40 --> 02:21:32.84 purpose as little remains to be said after 147 days towns and food supplies which he'd originally
02:21:32.84 --> 02:21:38.20 stated would only last a month ran out confident from his exchange with the Turkish commander
02:21:38.20 --> 02:21:45.24 that he would be treated generously he capitulated on April 19th 1916 and handed his weak
02:21:45.24 --> 02:21:51.80 starving men over to the not so tender mercy of the Turks then it was where their paths diverged
02:21:53.32 --> 02:21:58.84 while he was transported in the greatest comfort to Baghdad and then to constant a noble
02:21:58.84 --> 02:22:05.48 his 13,000 men began their 1,200 mile march across the air and waste and freezing heights
02:22:05.48 --> 02:22:11.72 of Asia Minor and while he was wind and dined honored and entertained as the personal
02:22:11.72 --> 02:22:16.68 guest of the Turkish commander in chief his men died in their thousands of starvation
02:22:16.68 --> 02:22:22.44 dysentery, cholera and typhus and from the whips of their bad tempered Kurdistan guards
02:22:22.44 --> 02:22:30.60 they died of the heat by day and of cold by night they died because they we read of staying alive
02:22:30.60 --> 02:22:35.40 dropping out of the column to be set upon by marauding Arabs who have robbed them
02:22:36.28 --> 02:22:43.48 filled their mouths with sand and stones in all 70% of the British and 50% of the Indian troops
02:22:43.48 --> 02:22:53.16 perished in captivity but towns in it was spared these sword details for he traveled by train and
02:22:53.16 --> 02:22:59.56 arrived at Constantinople on June 3rd was met by the general commander of the Turkish army his staff
02:22:59.56 --> 02:23:04.68 members of the war office in a crowd of respectful locals he felt very flattered he was even more
02:23:04.68 --> 02:23:10.44 flattered to be entertained later at Constantinople's best restaurant then escorted by a detachment
02:23:10.44 --> 02:23:18.04 of cavalry to the waterfront where a naval pinnus waited him his baggage staff and servants aboard
02:23:18.04 --> 02:23:25.000 he sailed 10 miles down the sea of marmarah to the fashionable island of halkey where
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:29.72 high on a cliff he took up residence in a comfortable villa that same day in the building the
02:23:29.72 --> 02:23:34.60 Turks called the hospital those of towns and troops still too ill to march from samara
02:23:34.60 --> 02:23:40.12 were being allowed by their captors to die in agony there was no treatment for them and very
02:23:40.12 --> 02:23:45.40 little food and those who found their beds were given an injection of brandly color fluid after
02:23:45.40 --> 02:23:52.52 which they stopped fouling their beds because they were dead by that same day more than a third
02:23:52.52 --> 02:23:56.36 of the British troops to whom towns had had vowed he was leaving them only to procure their
02:23:56.36 --> 02:24:09.32 reparation had died yeah I don't know for getting any worse than that
02:24:09.32 --> 02:24:24.52 back to the point of this book in conclusion one point demands particular emphasis
02:24:24.52 --> 02:24:30.60 and the mismanagement of the messa patonian campaign sheer stupidity played a relatively
02:24:30.60 --> 02:24:35.56 minor role certainly duff was no genius and Nixon was on intelligent but towns and was not
02:24:35.56 --> 02:24:41.88 men's fates were decided for them not so much by idiots as by commanders with marked
02:24:41.88 --> 02:24:49.72 psychopathic traits stupidity and ignorance there may have been but it was the ambitious
02:24:49.72 --> 02:24:54.68 striving of disturbed personalities which accounted for the loss of towns and force
02:24:56.92 --> 02:25:04.28 in such matters as vanity personal ambition dishonesty lack of compassion
02:25:04.28 --> 02:25:11.16 towns and was not unique where he differed from others was in possessing charm intelligence
02:25:11.16 --> 02:25:17.96 and professional expertise in a world of the square the pompous and the desperately unfunny towns
02:25:17.96 --> 02:25:25.32 and hound a reflection laid light touch but underneath the agreeable veneer they lay a fatal
02:25:25.32 --> 02:25:31.40 flaw which showed itself in ravenous self destructive hunger for popular acclaim
02:25:31.40 --> 02:25:39.16 though its origins remain obscure towns and gave the impression of a man who at some time had
02:25:39.16 --> 02:25:44.28 suffered traumatic damage to a self esteem which resulted in an everlasting need
02:25:47.48 --> 02:25:53.40 to be loved well
02:25:53.40 --> 02:26:04.04 that kind of wraps up the world war one phase but there you go you got a smart man
02:26:04.76 --> 02:26:11.32 a charismatic man a guy with combat experience and a guy with psychopathic traits
02:26:14.84 --> 02:26:21.32 and we take those first one smart man charismatic man right that guy would breeze through
02:26:21.32 --> 02:26:26.20 uh officer so you know if we're looking for an officer like this guy's very charismatic he's
02:26:26.20 --> 02:26:29.48 very intelligent right oh but let's sign him up let's put him in charge of something
02:26:32.60 --> 02:26:37.80 and not only do we bring him in but then he's gonna rise through the ranks because he's
02:26:37.80 --> 02:26:47.08 charming and he's smart right and he's he he as things go well when things are going well he's
02:26:47.08 --> 02:26:55.48 freaking fantastic but the minute things went bad the the psychopathic monster comes out
02:26:58.04 --> 02:27:04.92 that's what we need to avoid that's what we need to look out for that's what we need to prevent
02:27:04.92 --> 02:27:10.92 and the only way we can do that is to study the past and try and understand it to the best of our
02:27:10.92 --> 02:27:16.92 ability
02:27:16.92 --> 02:27:23.40 anything else Dave that's a rough one this is just this has been a downhill adventure from the word
02:27:23.40 --> 02:27:29.40 go man and it's hard to listen to you you set it up I think really well at the very beginning of
02:27:29.40 --> 02:27:35.000 the last podcast this is these are not stupid people and it gets reinforced just like that final
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.40 that little conclusion you just express your like this understanding these are not dumb people
02:27:39.40 --> 02:27:46.28 and the psychopathic trade of the psychopathic tendency the thing that might trigger that in us
02:27:47.08 --> 02:27:51.72 connected to the idea of humility is the fear of being exposed for not being smart or the
02:27:51.72 --> 02:27:56.12 fear being exposed for not knowing what to do or the fear being exposed for not understanding what's going
02:27:56.12 --> 02:28:05.48 on and how powerful that fear can be to get you to behave in a way I wouldn't I probably wouldn't
02:28:05.48 --> 02:28:11.08 use the word psychopathic very often to describe too many people and it's totally appropriate here
02:28:11.08 --> 02:28:15.88 yeah well it's weird when you think a psychopathic you think of someone that thinks of their own
02:28:15.88 --> 02:28:23.40 self so they murder someone so they make this move and and do whatever they're going to do
02:28:23.40 --> 02:28:32.04 that negatively impacts you know some other person or maybe a few people you don't think of it
02:28:32.04 --> 02:28:39.64 of where it impacts 12,000 people right it's just 23,000 people or 23,000 people it's just insane
02:28:39.64 --> 02:28:44.52 yeah and and just the thing I was thinking about too and and I'm trying to just make some
02:28:44.52 --> 02:28:51.40 of an objective reconnection to the things we teach this idea of leadership is god I wish I
02:28:51.40 --> 02:28:59.16 were to down but the the the the the the respect for your subordinates loyal to the loyalty to your
02:28:59.16 --> 02:29:03.96 subordinates the belief in their just their basic welfare and this kid's just their basic welfare
02:29:05.56 --> 02:29:10.84 how liberating it is if you're surrounded by people that know that you care about them to like hey
02:29:10.84 --> 02:29:16.84 fellas I don't know the answer to this one and I'm like no factors where we'll figure it out
02:29:16.84 --> 02:29:24.76 hey I'm not really sure what we should do here so no problem that we can we got this and how many
02:29:24.76 --> 02:29:30.52 times the best thing I ever did was tell my my subordinates my junior Marines that were junior
02:29:30.52 --> 02:29:36.92 to me in the hierarchy that senior NCOs, mid grade NCOs and be like hey Goney what do you think I should
02:29:36.92 --> 02:29:41.64 do here so I've seen this ten times here's what I think you should do cool right on and just the
02:29:41.64 --> 02:29:46.52 willingness to reveal that you're not smart or reveal that you don't have the answer or the willingness
02:29:46.52 --> 02:29:51.32 it just be get past the fear of what what will I look like if I don't know and it's actually
02:29:51.32 --> 02:29:56.04 the best thing you can do the best thing you can do is go hey Jaco dude I don't know what to do here man
02:29:57.48 --> 02:30:03.88 and if I actually care about your welfare and they know that Jaco will solve that problem for me
02:30:03.88 --> 02:30:08.52 help me figure it out or or or come up with a thousand different ways that we could try to make this
02:30:08.52 --> 02:30:17.000 thing work out but if I said come to that fear of maybe this cost me my my desire to be the king of
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:22.52 Baghdad maybe this is the one that exposes me and I cannot let that happen the ends the lengths that
02:30:22.52 --> 02:30:28.52 people are willing to go to and I think you said it that people are willing people are willing to
02:30:28.52 --> 02:30:35.16 die before tell me what you said I just they would rather die than take an injury to there you go
02:30:35.16 --> 02:30:38.92 then take an injury to their ego yeah they would rather die than take an injury to their ego and
02:30:38.92 --> 02:30:42.92 and this is the case where it's not their death it's the death of tens of thousands of their
02:30:42.92 --> 02:30:47.96 other people because they don't see them as human beings and the heart's part is is all the lead up
02:30:47.96 --> 02:30:53.48 of the crami and war the borrower like a world of two world of one's common world of one's
02:30:53.48 --> 02:30:57.24 common we're not going to learn in these lessons and you just see this this tragedy coming because
02:30:57.24 --> 02:31:02.60 you know what happens in history and like is this really going to happen and yeah this is this is
02:31:02.60 --> 02:31:06.68 really going to happen and that's I think that's what's made this so hard for me is like man
02:31:07.96 --> 02:31:12.60 we're not gonna we're not gonna fix this in history so I just got to listen to this story knowing
02:31:12.60 --> 02:31:16.68 exactly what's gonna happen yeah you can't change what you know is coming you already know where
02:31:16.68 --> 02:31:22.28 this story is going and you can't change it and the the other really scary thing about this is
02:31:22.92 --> 02:31:28.60 like I just said these are people that you know I like towns and he burrieses through office or
02:31:28.60 --> 02:31:35.40 selection he's freaking class president oh yes right he's smart he's got some dapper tomb he's
02:31:35.40 --> 02:31:40.92 friendly he's charming this guy is just a you know winner all day yeah and he's surrounded by
02:31:40.92 --> 02:31:48.12 people that aren't so he stands out oh yeah you know people say I started off all these podcasts
02:31:48.12 --> 02:31:51.64 by saying sometimes and this is certainly true in the seal tapes out if you're in the seal
02:31:51.64 --> 02:31:55.64 teams you know everyone thinks that someone is in the seal teams they're like incredible human
02:31:55.64 --> 02:32:00.04 incredible whatever people think that about everybody that's in the military all this person was a
02:32:00.04 --> 02:32:05.40 general this person wasn't admiral they must be freaking awesome and look there are tons of awesome
02:32:05.40 --> 02:32:11.32 seals and tons of awesome admirals and tons of awesome awesome generals and kernels yes we get
02:32:11.32 --> 02:32:15.72 that but occasionally look at when you go she's what just happened where did that come from and
02:32:15.72 --> 02:32:22.60 here's where it came from because inside these organizations they if you're up you know what I said
02:32:22.60 --> 02:32:27.08 this thing about I don't know for you what podcast I said it on but I was talking about the fact
02:32:27.08 --> 02:32:36.36 oh it was with their Cooper in a bad organization the worst person rises to the top like the
02:32:36.36 --> 02:32:42.60 person that is willing to just be totally ruthless is gonna like if you take the Nazis who's gonna
02:32:42.60 --> 02:32:49.32 ride to the top the guys that are willing to do whatever those ones that ride to the top they
02:32:49.32 --> 02:32:54.12 become the leaders of the mob who's willing to go out and kill people and that because those
02:32:54.12 --> 02:33:01.08 the people that rise to the top and unfortunately sometimes even in a good organization a person with
02:33:01.08 --> 02:33:07.56 those traits that can kind of kind of hide those traits they can still make it through the
02:33:07.56 --> 02:33:12.68 wickets and rise to the top and it's until they get put under pressure that they go whoa
02:33:14.36 --> 02:33:22.44 and their and their true self comes out well good place to stop for today and we know we need to be
02:33:22.44 --> 02:33:31.000 looking on the lookout for people with psychopathic traits and the meantime you know maybe we try and
02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:35.000 avoid having those traits ourselves maybe we actually try and become something a little bit more
02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:42.28 positive something good maybe we try and make ourselves better echo Charles just a just
02:33:42.28 --> 02:33:50.44 little psychopsycopathy apparently from what I understand is it like it's like a thing in your mind
02:33:50.44 --> 02:33:56.60 like a normal seemingly normal person can be a psych and a clinical psychopath it has less to do
02:33:56.60 --> 02:34:02.68 with like crazy stuff that they do it's just the inability to if I'm not mistaken to empathize
02:34:02.68 --> 02:34:07.48 with people that's one of the big problems yeah so yeah so it kind of makes sense where I mean
02:34:07.48 --> 02:34:13.40 I don't know if he's making a clinical claim clinical assessment coppathy or whatever but
02:34:13.96 --> 02:34:20.04 if you if these people were psychopathic that's what it would look like I'm gonna say yeah if
02:34:20.04 --> 02:34:27.96 you do what towns and did yeah and you're in a villa while your men are being butchered starved
02:34:27.96 --> 02:34:33.16 tortured killed you're a freaking psychopath right while telling her leadership hey I think I should
02:34:33.16 --> 02:34:38.52 get promoted and get evacuated yeah it's like you just don't I mean oh and do you think this and
02:34:38.52 --> 02:34:43.16 maybe this is like maybe goes without saying or maybe kind of obvious or whatever but
02:34:43.72 --> 02:34:49.000 is this one of those situations where you know how like you're such so ahead of all the competition
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:56.28 and your organization or whatever your team or whatever is so big where victory is almost like a
02:34:56.28 --> 02:35:02.60 foregone conclusion and you start caring about other stuff like you get like these individual
02:35:02.60 --> 02:35:08.76 self-interest that's spring up because the real goal and the real like worry is kind of like
02:35:09.48 --> 02:35:14.12 on the back burner now you I think you're right I think that that's the British army thought that they were
02:35:14.12 --> 02:35:20.20 just right right yeah the British military thought it was in municipal right so they're just more
02:35:20.20 --> 02:35:26.04 concentrated yeah like okay we know we're yeah you know we're gonna do that or that's obvious or
02:35:26.04 --> 02:35:32.52 whatever so literally you know so nice start caring about like you know my the king of wherever and
02:35:32.52 --> 02:35:36.84 all these other you know personal interest whatever I'm gonna say something that I don't know
02:35:36.84 --> 02:35:41.40 maybe this makes me a psychopath if I would have been in charge of the British military
02:35:41.40 --> 02:35:47.000 I would have assembled a hit team and we would have gone and killed towns and like execution
02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:53.40 style and brought his body back and said hey leaders this is not how we lead
02:35:55.48 --> 02:35:59.80 into the question you asked too I think given the author's education he's using that term
02:36:00.44 --> 02:36:05.96 in the clinical sense like that is not like it's not a slang term for a dude is kind of messed up
02:36:05.96 --> 02:36:11.88 he's calling him he's he's referring to the psychopathic tendencies he means that in the the medical
02:36:11.88 --> 02:36:15.96 literal sense of that word right yeah exactly that's what it felt like to where it's like yeah
02:36:15.96 --> 02:36:20.60 you know 20 from 1000 people dying in this guy didn't care he cared about the one we set up
02:36:20.60 --> 02:36:27.88 the last podcast this guy's background right oh see what's funny is I knew when you guys are
02:36:27.88 --> 02:36:32.20 start making jokes about that I didn't know when I didn't know who which is interesting it was
02:36:32.20 --> 02:36:39.16 Dave Burke good deal Dave apparently but either way yes I'm here now that you're now I'm here now
02:36:39.88 --> 02:36:43.88 yeah I'm here to let you guys know how to avoid psychopath we're moving right into the
02:36:43.88 --> 02:36:49.80 title of the topic behavior because I don't know if one can avoid actual psychopathy I think
02:36:49.80 --> 02:36:54.92 you're either psychopath or not okay okay but how can we at least make ourselves a little bit better
02:36:54.92 --> 02:37:00.68 it's like avoiding celiac disease you know celiac disease so it's like you can't avoid celiac
02:37:00.68 --> 02:37:07.16 disease but you can avoid gluten you see I'm saying correct anyway so we talk about discipline
02:37:07.16 --> 02:37:12.60 the supplement now not necessarily just discipline as discipline the supplement okay discipline go
02:37:12.92 --> 02:37:19.96 ready to drink energy drink a new era of energy drink a new idea of energy drink
02:37:19.96 --> 02:37:27.16 indeed gluten free by the way nice nice sugar free sugar free gluten free chemical free
02:37:27.16 --> 02:37:33.64 um so conservative free because it's it's pasteurized yeah so we're not gonna put any chemicals in your body
02:37:33.64 --> 02:37:40.60 yeah into your temple yes exactly right so so what you need what you want what you expect from
02:37:40.60 --> 02:37:46.36 an energy drink the good parts you get that no downside but you don't get the job
02:37:46.36 --> 02:37:51.64 exactly right the downside there's no downside see so me I just drink three okay I'm saying I drink
02:37:51.64 --> 02:37:57.000 three today you drink three today okay I'm more healthy than I was
02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:02.20 before that's a good feeling that's really good right okay many different flavors wrapped
02:38:02.20 --> 02:38:07.40 to what seven flavors that one now I think we're at seven what's the best one mango
02:38:07.40 --> 02:38:16.68 100% Dave what's the best one it's not you're at mango yeah well hey look hey
02:38:16.68 --> 02:38:21.32 mango's good I'm gonna say it right now I like mango I can and it's one of the better
02:38:21.32 --> 02:38:26.36 flavors I would say yeah so you know how like different people like different flavors like
02:38:26.36 --> 02:38:30.92 my middle daughter tax average all day Dakota what you got it's like all day obviously
02:38:30.92 --> 02:38:35.56 my son sour apple sniper not the fake about that I understand but my wife
02:38:35.56 --> 02:38:40.52 going going to this and she's cracking open all kinds she's of she's mixing it up mixed party
02:38:40.52 --> 02:38:45.32 party mix well the new season they're all good technically you're not gonna really drink
02:38:45.32 --> 02:38:49.72 one to be like oh this one sucks it's gonna be pretty rare that's gonna happen so I dig it
02:38:49.72 --> 02:38:54.60 and I understand but technically yeah man but either way whatever flavor you guys like look this is
02:38:54.60 --> 02:39:00.60 the new the new era the new what do you paradigm right this word of energy drinks don't have to
02:39:00.60 --> 02:39:07.56 worry about all that bad stuff so yeah get get that you also stuff for your joints this is
02:39:07.56 --> 02:39:12.84 important you might not think about it every day might I excite some of us like other supplements
02:39:12.84 --> 02:39:20.36 might but when your joints start acting up then you'll be excited to have them not act up
02:39:20.36 --> 02:39:24.92 say you take joint warfare super krill oil get on a routine too you want up to everybody you're
02:39:24.92 --> 02:39:30.44 enjoying it anymore there you go but the vitamin D3 called war we got extra protein if you need it
02:39:30.44 --> 02:39:35.32 in the form of milk that's the one to get excited which you could call protein we could call dessert
02:39:36.04 --> 02:39:41.96 let's face it bro it is so tasty you're gonna eat in some elk which by the way we're eating
02:39:41.96 --> 02:39:46.76 not the only cow sold right now kind of a lot but sometimes you get done you're like hmm I
02:39:46.76 --> 02:39:54.44 wouldn't mind some dessert to go on top of that fine meal I just have hey but I don't want to eat ice
02:39:54.44 --> 02:40:00.52 cream I'm definitely not eating cake because we're not cake eaters over here no no no no no
02:40:00.52 --> 02:40:08.92 do you Dave Burke do you put um like no you just got actually you know what I knew that I think
02:40:08.92 --> 02:40:14.52 you told me that already here's the thing that the frozen banana the frozen like overly right
