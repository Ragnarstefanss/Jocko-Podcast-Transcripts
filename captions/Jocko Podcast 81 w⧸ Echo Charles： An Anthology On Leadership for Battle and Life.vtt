00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.56
This is Jockel Podcast number 81.

2
00:00:05.56 --> 00:00:09.56
With echoed Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:09.56 --> 00:00:10.56
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:10.56 --> 00:00:11.36
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.36 --> 00:00:20.08
November 29, 1915.

6
00:00:20.08 --> 00:00:22.76
It has teamed.

7
00:00:22.76 --> 00:00:25.32
The trenches are ankle deep.

8
00:00:25.32 --> 00:00:28.92
Some places calf deep in mud.

9
00:00:28.92 --> 00:00:35.52
The communications trenches are rushing streams of brown water.

10
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:40.04
The manor wet through, but stick the job like Britons.

11
00:00:40.04 --> 00:00:45.88
And I hope for their sake that the weather lifts with the morning.

12
00:00:45.88 --> 00:00:52.36
The guns have been strafing today, though up till now we have dodged the show.

13
00:00:52.36 --> 00:00:57.32
It may be ours again tomorrow though.

14
00:00:57.32 --> 00:01:02.68
It never knows.

15
00:01:02.68 --> 00:01:12.08
This is from the diary of Captain Charlie May, the British Army Officer Commander

16
00:01:12.08 --> 00:01:21.36
of B Company, 22nd Manchester Pals Battalion of the Manchester Regiment who served in World

17
00:01:21.36 --> 00:01:25.20
War I.

18
00:01:25.20 --> 00:01:28.80
He was married to Bessie May.

19
00:01:28.80 --> 00:01:36.48
And they had one daughter who was born July 20th, 1914.

20
00:01:36.48 --> 00:01:49.72
So she was a little over a year old when this journal was being written from the trenches.

21
00:01:49.72 --> 00:01:53.20
And it continues December 1, 1915.

22
00:01:53.20 --> 00:01:56.60
It is exciting work, sniping.

23
00:01:56.60 --> 00:02:04.72
In fact, one must curb the tendency less that should become a fascination.

24
00:02:04.72 --> 00:02:10.44
The second in command of the E-lance, the East Landchester Regiment, and myself put in a couple

25
00:02:10.44 --> 00:02:17.88
hours this morning and had quite a bit of fun warning the baches in their trenches.

26
00:02:17.88 --> 00:02:24.28
The fellow was walking across the open 2,000 yards off when I spotted him and let go.

27
00:02:24.28 --> 00:02:28.28
You never saw a chap move quicker in your life.

28
00:02:28.28 --> 00:02:34.52
He ran for a tree and jumped behind it and I let him have four more there.

29
00:02:34.52 --> 00:02:42.44
Whether I got him or not, I don't know, but he didn't move for the next half hour.

30
00:02:42.44 --> 00:02:47.40
I know because I waited so anxiously for him.

31
00:02:47.40 --> 00:02:54.36
This night, or rather, one 30 this morning, I got outside the barbed wire and got lost.

32
00:02:54.36 --> 00:03:00.44
Three times I had to fling myself down in the wet grass, bury my nose in it and grovel

33
00:03:00.44 --> 00:03:04.56
while the machine guns went chattering over me.

34
00:03:04.56 --> 00:03:14.52
It is remarkable with what speed one learns to adopt the prone position.

35
00:03:14.52 --> 00:03:26.20
January 13, 1916, I long and long to see you, to class view in my arms and I long with

36
00:03:26.20 --> 00:03:30.60
all my heart to see my baby.

37
00:03:30.60 --> 00:03:33.80
How I love her.

38
00:03:33.80 --> 00:03:43.64
What hopes I have for her what a sweet girl she will make.

39
00:03:43.64 --> 00:03:50.92
February 25, 1916 woke up this morning to find the snow, pelting down and covering the ground

40
00:03:50.92 --> 00:03:54.20
fully five inches deep.

41
00:03:54.20 --> 00:03:56.60
Also, it was freezing hard.

42
00:03:56.60 --> 00:04:01.16
Cotton, a fellow officer, came into breakfast with us.

43
00:04:01.16 --> 00:04:09.72
He brought the little Bible which another soldier had taken from the body of a dead German.

44
00:04:09.72 --> 00:04:18.36
On the fly leaf in a child's hand writing, the word, dad-dad.

45
00:04:18.36 --> 00:04:22.12
War is very sad.

46
00:04:22.12 --> 00:04:31.60
Perhaps the man may have done and been something to loath and to test, I do not know.

47
00:04:31.60 --> 00:04:37.56
All I am conscious of is that somewhere in his fatherland there is a little child who

48
00:04:37.56 --> 00:04:45.000
called him, dad-dad.

49
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.96
April 6, 1916, Fritz strafed our new trenches with heavies and searched round the support

50
00:04:51.96 --> 00:04:58.32
with H.E. Shrapnel and other such obnoxious stuff.

51
00:04:58.32 --> 00:05:04.12
One shell claimed three NCOs and wounded three men.

52
00:05:04.12 --> 00:05:12.28
We all feel wild to get at the beast and I hope we may string them up on the wire.

53
00:05:12.28 --> 00:05:17.08
I saw the killed go down the line.

54
00:05:17.08 --> 00:05:21.04
It was a pitiful sight.

55
00:05:21.04 --> 00:05:26.88
Poor boys, shell fire is a horrid thing.

56
00:05:26.88 --> 00:05:34.72
A lad who was a sergeant of mine was the worst.

57
00:05:34.72 --> 00:05:41.56
It was very, very sad.

58
00:05:41.56 --> 00:05:49.04
Do those at home realize how their boys go out for them?

59
00:05:49.04 --> 00:05:51.68
Never can they do enough for their soldiers?

60
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:56.84
Never can they repay the debt they owe?

61
00:05:56.84 --> 00:06:02.56
Not that the men ask any reward.

62
00:06:02.56 --> 00:06:07.16
But one day we'll get out of with the bayonet.

63
00:06:07.16 --> 00:06:13.92
We'll take our price then for Grezzi and all the other hundreds, thousands, Grezzi's

64
00:06:13.92 --> 00:06:22.28
slain as they were standing at their posts.

65
00:06:22.28 --> 00:06:38.76
June 17, 1916, I do not want to die.

66
00:06:38.76 --> 00:06:49.12
The thought that I may never see you or our darling baby again turns my bowels to water.

67
00:06:49.12 --> 00:06:57.12
My conscience is clear that I have always tried to make life a joy for you.

68
00:06:57.12 --> 00:07:02.88
But it is the thought that our babe may grow up without my knowing her and without her

69
00:07:02.88 --> 00:07:06.56
knowing me.

70
00:07:06.56 --> 00:07:13.20
I pray God I may do my duty for I know whatever that may entail.

71
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:20.92
You would not have it otherwise.

72
00:07:20.92 --> 00:07:28.16
June 23, 1916, everything is speeding up to no end.

73
00:07:28.16 --> 00:07:31.96
Ammunition by the hundred wagon load is pouring up.

74
00:07:31.96 --> 00:07:37.52
It should certainly not be for lack of ammunition if we do not make a huge success of the

75
00:07:37.52 --> 00:07:40.36
venture.

76
00:07:40.36 --> 00:07:46.20
That one cannot help feeling a little anxious and worried.

77
00:07:46.20 --> 00:07:54.000
So much depends on this great throw.

78
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.68
What he's talking about there in this part of the journal, it reflects the build-up for

79
00:07:59.68 --> 00:08:02.80
the battle of the soul.

80
00:08:02.80 --> 00:08:09.60
Although Charlie doesn't know exactly when the battle is going to commence, they're

81
00:08:09.60 --> 00:08:14.28
obviously only distributing that information with people that have the need to know.

82
00:08:14.28 --> 00:08:20.000
They know that a major attack is forthcoming.

83
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
That's why they've got all that ammunition piled up more than they could ever think

84
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.04
they could possibly need.

85
00:08:29.04 --> 00:08:38.40
Back to the journal, June 28, 1916.

86
00:08:38.40 --> 00:08:44.52
The moment seems very auspicious for us to strike.

87
00:08:44.52 --> 00:08:51.28
Perhaps we will on Friday.

88
00:08:51.28 --> 00:08:56.84
July 1, 1916.

89
00:08:56.84 --> 00:09:00.40
We marched up to the assembly trench last night.

90
00:09:00.40 --> 00:09:03.68
The most exciting, march imaginable.

91
00:09:03.68 --> 00:09:08.68
Once all around crashed and roared till some times it was quite impossible to hear oneself

92
00:09:08.68 --> 00:09:10.64
speak.

93
00:09:10.64 --> 00:09:18.48
It was however a fine sight and one realized from it what gunpower really means.

94
00:09:18.48 --> 00:09:24.12
Fritz, of course, strafed back and reply, causing us some un-easiness and a few casualties

95
00:09:24.12 --> 00:09:27.36
before we even reached the line.

96
00:09:27.36 --> 00:09:32.52
The night passed noisily and with a few more casualties.

97
00:09:32.52 --> 00:09:40.80
The hunt puts a barrage on us every now and then and generally claims one or two victims.

98
00:09:40.80 --> 00:09:44.12
It is a glorious morning.

99
00:09:44.12 --> 00:09:47.96
We go over in two hours time.

100
00:09:47.96 --> 00:09:53.64
It seems a long time to wait and I think whatever happens, we shall all feel relieved

101
00:09:53.64 --> 00:09:58.32
once the line is launched.

102
00:09:58.32 --> 00:10:02.44
No man's land is a tangled desert.

103
00:10:02.44 --> 00:10:10.72
Unless one could see it, one cannot imagine what a terrible state of disorder it is in.

104
00:10:10.72 --> 00:10:17.32
But we do not yet seem to have stopped the machine guns.

105
00:10:17.32 --> 00:10:23.32
These are popping off all along our parapet as I write.

106
00:10:23.32 --> 00:10:31.04
I trust they will not claim too many of our lads before the day is over.

107
00:10:31.04 --> 00:10:37.24
Now I close this old diary down for the next few days since I may not take it into the line.

108
00:10:37.24 --> 00:10:51.000
I will keep a record of how things go and enter it up later.

109
00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:01.96
Well, that update never took place.

110
00:11:01.96 --> 00:11:08.60
Charlie May was wrong about how many British soldiers would be claimed before the day

111
00:11:08.60 --> 00:11:09.80
was over.

112
00:11:09.80 --> 00:11:14.000
He didn't think it would claim too many but as you know the first day of the battle to

113
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:24.92
have a son July 1 turned out to be the worst day in history for the British Army.

114
00:11:24.92 --> 00:11:31.76
And they suffered almost 60,000 casualties.

115
00:11:31.76 --> 00:11:39.32
60,000 casualties in one day.

116
00:11:39.32 --> 00:11:48.04
Like I said, those casualties included Charlie May when we were over the top.

117
00:11:48.04 --> 00:11:57.24
On July 1st under the cover of Allied artillery, he was leading B company.

118
00:11:57.24 --> 00:12:01.64
And he and his men fought their way across no man's land and just as they reached German

119
00:12:01.64 --> 00:12:09.08
lines Charlie was hit by shell fire then killed.

120
00:12:09.08 --> 00:12:14.36
And his diary was found by the man that eventually dragged him back to the trenches.

121
00:12:14.36 --> 00:12:37.60
Private Arthur Bunting, who mailed the diary to Charlie's wife, mod.

122
00:12:37.60 --> 00:12:46.84
Now the British have a steeped military history.

123
00:12:46.84 --> 00:12:52.24
And obviously this is the kingdom that we Americans rebelled against in the Revolutionary

124
00:12:52.24 --> 00:12:57.88
War and we fought them again in the war of 1812.

125
00:12:57.88 --> 00:13:05.04
And we actually had a bunch of other little various disputes with them until the late 1800s

126
00:13:05.04 --> 00:13:12.04
and during something called the Great Reproachment through various forces in the world.

127
00:13:12.04 --> 00:13:20.84
Our political objectives were aligned and we became the staunchest of allies with Great Britain

128
00:13:20.84 --> 00:13:27.64
through World War I and World War II in Korea and Vietnam and even up till now and Iraq

129
00:13:27.64 --> 00:13:31.96
and Afghanistan.

130
00:13:31.96 --> 00:13:38.000
I've been lucky enough to work alongside Brits on just a couple of occasions while I was

131
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.44
in the military and there's no doubt that they are just outstanding troops professional

132
00:13:48.44 --> 00:13:54.64
in everything that they do and they leave that impression on you.

133
00:13:54.64 --> 00:14:04.48
You can actually feel the pride of their military tradition.

134
00:14:04.48 --> 00:14:15.72
And tonight I wanted to take a look at a book that is part of that military tradition.

135
00:14:15.72 --> 00:14:24.36
And the book is called Serve to Lead.

136
00:14:24.36 --> 00:14:29.56
And I'm going to start with some statements from the introduction to this version of

137
00:14:29.56 --> 00:14:33.12
the book and the version of the book that I'm reading is the old version.

138
00:14:33.12 --> 00:14:40.40
I think it's from 1954 or 57 originally written right after World War II and these

139
00:14:40.40 --> 00:14:49.40
comments here are from a guy named Robin Matthews, a former British Army officer graduate

140
00:14:49.40 --> 00:14:55.20
of the Royal Military Academy of Sanhurst, that's like the British West Point.

141
00:14:55.20 --> 00:14:59.92
He went on to command his regiment the Light Dragoons, which included a tour of duty in

142
00:14:59.92 --> 00:15:02.40
Iraq in 2005.

143
00:15:02.40 --> 00:15:10.72
He also served with 16 aerosol brigade in Hellman Province in Afghanistan.

144
00:15:10.72 --> 00:15:14.44
And here's what he has to say about this book.

145
00:15:14.44 --> 00:15:20.88
Serve to Lead is a remarkable book, produced by the Royal Military Academy Sanhurst after

146
00:15:20.88 --> 00:15:23.000
the Second World War.

147
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.52
It is as clear and concise a treatise on leadership as you will find.

148
00:15:29.52 --> 00:15:34.92
It also provides a fascinating glimpse into what sets the profession of arms apart from

149
00:15:34.92 --> 00:15:40.72
any other.

150
00:15:40.72 --> 00:15:46.20
Serve to Lead is a anonymous with Sandhurst, placed on the bed of every officer cadet

151
00:15:46.20 --> 00:15:52.08
at the beginning of their military training, somewhere between prayer book, which is what

152
00:15:52.08 --> 00:15:58.40
I thought it was initially and Bible, as it has often been referred, it lays out what

153
00:15:58.40 --> 00:16:02.16
is expected and what to expect.

154
00:16:02.16 --> 00:16:08.96
On a quivotally, it establishes selflessness, self-discipline, integrity, and duty as the

155
00:16:08.96 --> 00:16:11.68
bedrock of leadership.

156
00:16:11.68 --> 00:16:16.52
Excitingly it speaks of courage and boldness as the essential differentiators upon which

157
00:16:16.52 --> 00:16:24.88
events turn and to which soldiers and leaders are instinctively drawn.

158
00:16:24.88 --> 00:16:30.48
There is so much to enjoy and consider on every page, but the most buggiling message of

159
00:16:30.48 --> 00:16:35.52
the book concerns humility.

160
00:16:35.52 --> 00:16:40.52
Leadership must be confident, but unless it is matched in equal measure by humility,

161
00:16:40.52 --> 00:16:46.48
it jars at which point the lead simply fall away.

162
00:16:46.48 --> 00:16:52.28
If I am to lead you first and foremost, I must be your servant.

163
00:16:52.28 --> 00:16:55.48
Like any good book, the clue is in the title.

164
00:16:55.48 --> 00:17:07.72
In this case, simple, seemingly contradictory, but ultimately profound, serve to lead.

165
00:17:07.72 --> 00:17:09.92
That is the intro to this book.

166
00:17:09.92 --> 00:17:11.20
Obviously there is a dichotomy of leadership.

167
00:17:11.20 --> 00:17:15.80
He is already talking about things that we talk about all the time.

168
00:17:15.80 --> 00:17:19.20
And yes, you have got to be confident, but you have got to be humble.

169
00:17:19.20 --> 00:17:23.76
The title of the book is a contradiction to use a dichotomy in its own sense, right,

170
00:17:23.76 --> 00:17:27.68
serve to lead.

171
00:17:27.68 --> 00:17:31.32
And like I said, this book, they actually have a new one.

172
00:17:31.32 --> 00:17:33.12
And I have the new one.

173
00:17:33.12 --> 00:17:34.64
I went with the old one.

174
00:17:34.64 --> 00:17:38.04
And the reason I went with the old one is a couple things that I am going to point out that

175
00:17:38.04 --> 00:17:42.04
clearly they have changed their thoughts on.

176
00:17:42.04 --> 00:17:44.88
And maybe we will end up doing a comparison contrast with the new one.

177
00:17:44.88 --> 00:17:49.68
There aren't that many differences, but there certainly are some very significant differences

178
00:17:49.68 --> 00:17:53.08
and we will get to those.

179
00:17:53.08 --> 00:18:02.000
But this is going to kick off with a piece from the Lord Bishop of Durham.

180
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.20
It is the fact that some men possess an in-bred superiority which gives them a dominating

181
00:18:07.20 --> 00:18:13.56
influence over their contemporaries and marks them out unmistakably for leadership.

182
00:18:13.56 --> 00:18:17.64
This phenomenon is as certain as it is mysterious.

183
00:18:17.64 --> 00:18:22.40
It is apparent in every association of human beings and every variety of circumstances

184
00:18:22.40 --> 00:18:25.12
and on every plane of culture.

185
00:18:25.12 --> 00:18:30.52
In a school among boys, in a college among the students, in a factory, shipyard or mine

186
00:18:30.52 --> 00:18:36.16
among the workmen, as certainly as in the church and in the nation, there are those who

187
00:18:36.16 --> 00:18:44.16
with an assured and unquestion title take the leading place and shape the general conduct.

188
00:18:44.16 --> 00:18:48.80
So there is an opinion in people who ask all the time, our leaders born or made, that

189
00:18:48.80 --> 00:18:52.84
one right there is, hey, leaders are born.

190
00:18:52.84 --> 00:18:56.20
And that's, I always say both.

191
00:18:56.20 --> 00:19:00.72
I always say there's certain leadership qualities that people are born with and some people

192
00:19:00.72 --> 00:19:03.08
are born with a lot of them.

193
00:19:03.08 --> 00:19:06.92
Some people are born with a lot of those qualities, some people are born with a lot less,

194
00:19:06.92 --> 00:19:08.96
some people aren't born with any.

195
00:19:08.96 --> 00:19:10.36
They're not going to be much of a leader.

196
00:19:10.36 --> 00:19:12.08
It doesn't matter how much you train them.

197
00:19:12.08 --> 00:19:15.04
You can get them better, but they're not going to be a great leader.

198
00:19:15.04 --> 00:19:20.40
And obviously, some leaders don't need much training.

199
00:19:20.40 --> 00:19:24.68
There's very few of those leaders that just don't, they just get it out of the gate as

200
00:19:24.68 --> 00:19:26.48
just born that way.

201
00:19:26.48 --> 00:19:28.16
I think it's a mixture of both.

202
00:19:28.16 --> 00:19:33.52
And I think you're born with some leadership capability and the more you hone it, the

203
00:19:33.52 --> 00:19:36.16
more you work on it, the better you're going to be.

204
00:19:36.16 --> 00:19:42.84
Why would you think, or why do you think that is, because to be a leader like the good

205
00:19:42.84 --> 00:19:44.56
strong qualities that you got to have,

206
00:19:44.56 --> 00:19:47.44
they're still contradicted or counterintuitive?

207
00:19:47.44 --> 00:19:51.80
They're not even counterintuitive, but you can get better at all of them.

208
00:19:51.80 --> 00:19:57.64
A couple of the one that's, for instance, some people are naturally talented, or some people

209
00:19:57.64 --> 00:20:00.20
are naturally articulate people.

210
00:20:00.20 --> 00:20:05.40
So they're able to get their message across in simple clear concise language.

211
00:20:05.40 --> 00:20:07.12
That's very important.

212
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:09.88
Now if you're born with that, you're lucky.

213
00:20:09.88 --> 00:20:10.88
Good job.

214
00:20:10.88 --> 00:20:11.88
You're born with that.

215
00:20:11.88 --> 00:20:13.000
You're born in a particular person.

216
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.56
If you weren't, guess what?

217
00:20:14.56 --> 00:20:15.56
You're going to have to work out it.

218
00:20:15.56 --> 00:20:16.56
You're going to have to read.

219
00:20:16.56 --> 00:20:17.56
You have to write, you have to listen.

220
00:20:17.56 --> 00:20:19.72
You're going to have to practice speaking to people.

221
00:20:19.72 --> 00:20:22.08
And you will get better at it.

222
00:20:22.08 --> 00:20:23.88
So those, that's your example.

223
00:20:23.88 --> 00:20:26.32
Some people just have it naturally.

224
00:20:26.32 --> 00:20:30.40
But even people that have it naturally will get better at it over time.

225
00:20:30.40 --> 00:20:33.08
I was always pretty comfortable speaking to people.

226
00:20:33.08 --> 00:20:36.32
But obviously, even when I was in the military, I spoke to people all the time.

227
00:20:36.32 --> 00:20:41.20
And when I was in a training, training situation as a young and listed seal, I was put up

228
00:20:41.20 --> 00:20:43.08
in front of the classroom and speak to people.

229
00:20:43.08 --> 00:20:44.28
I got better at it.

230
00:20:44.28 --> 00:20:47.80
And then when I became an officer and a leader, now I was briefing people.

231
00:20:47.80 --> 00:20:49.32
And so I'm doing it even more.

232
00:20:49.32 --> 00:20:52.32
And then I took over the training for the West Coast seals.

233
00:20:52.32 --> 00:20:54.28
And now I was briefing people all the time.

234
00:20:54.28 --> 00:20:57.60
And when I was overseas, I was briefing kernels and generals.

235
00:20:57.60 --> 00:20:59.88
And OK, you're going to brief a bunch of times.

236
00:20:59.88 --> 00:21:01.96
You're going to get better at it.

237
00:21:01.96 --> 00:21:04.44
I was already OK at it, just naturally.

238
00:21:04.44 --> 00:21:05.44
But I got better at it.

239
00:21:05.44 --> 00:21:07.96
And I'm still getting better at it today.

240
00:21:07.96 --> 00:21:13.84
So that's the same with any of these particular talents being able to simplify things,

241
00:21:13.84 --> 00:21:17.24
being able to detach those are all important leadership qualities.

242
00:21:17.24 --> 00:21:21.52
You can have a certain level that you're capable at.

243
00:21:21.52 --> 00:21:24.12
But the more you practice them, the better off you're going to be.

244
00:21:24.12 --> 00:21:25.12
Yeah.

245
00:21:25.12 --> 00:21:26.12
Yeah.

246
00:21:26.12 --> 00:21:27.12
So it's a combination.

247
00:21:27.12 --> 00:21:28.12
Yeah.

248
00:21:28.12 --> 00:21:33.80
So how you say like, there's it's pretty rare that you get somebody who's, you know,

249
00:21:33.80 --> 00:21:36.60
just has all the qualities right out the gate.

250
00:21:36.60 --> 00:21:37.60
Yeah.

251
00:21:37.60 --> 00:21:40.96
I can't, I've never met anybody that just just dominates and everything.

252
00:21:40.96 --> 00:21:41.96
Right.

253
00:21:41.96 --> 00:21:46.56
Because like, like, detaching, for example, that's not that's kind of counter to the

254
00:21:46.56 --> 00:21:47.96
your natural way of doing that.

255
00:21:47.96 --> 00:21:48.96
Yeah, that's true.

256
00:21:48.96 --> 00:21:49.96
Most people are going to want to get in there.

257
00:21:49.96 --> 00:21:50.96
Yeah.

258
00:21:50.96 --> 00:21:51.96
For sure.

259
00:21:51.96 --> 00:21:53.32
Now, I just thought of this example.

260
00:21:53.32 --> 00:21:56.76
I've talked about them a little bit on the podcast when we had Tim Ferson,

261
00:21:56.76 --> 00:21:57.76
Alden Lee Grizzard.

262
00:21:57.76 --> 00:22:03.64
He was, uh, he was my assistant, Patoon Commander when I was at Sealthine 1.

263
00:22:03.64 --> 00:22:05.04
And he got murdered.

264
00:22:05.04 --> 00:22:07.60
It was horrible, tragic situation.

265
00:22:07.60 --> 00:22:10.32
He was an involvement of murder suicide.

266
00:22:10.32 --> 00:22:13.44
And, but he, he had a lot of those capabilities.

267
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:15.84
He had a lot of, he was, a very articulate.

268
00:22:15.84 --> 00:22:18.000
He was in quarterback at the Navy football team.

269
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.60
So we had like a real good presence to him.

270
00:22:20.60 --> 00:22:22.16
He spoke clearly.

271
00:22:22.16 --> 00:22:27.56
He was down to earth and yet, you know, very, he could elevate himself very quickly when

272
00:22:27.56 --> 00:22:30.76
he was talking to the, you know, if you need to do elevate himself, you just had a lot of

273
00:22:30.76 --> 00:22:33.64
those qualities very naturally.

274
00:22:33.64 --> 00:22:36.60
And guess what, he was at the Naval Academy.

275
00:22:36.60 --> 00:22:37.60
He played football.

276
00:22:37.60 --> 00:22:40.88
He was constantly getting in front of him, you know, getting in the hotel and telling

277
00:22:40.88 --> 00:22:41.88
guys what was going to happen.

278
00:22:41.88 --> 00:22:43.72
And you get good at that over time.

279
00:22:43.72 --> 00:22:45.72
And part of that is, so I don't know how much of it.

280
00:22:45.72 --> 00:22:49.72
You know, I didn't know him when he was a football player when he was in eighth grade.

281
00:22:49.72 --> 00:22:53.000
Maybe he was stammering and trying to put his thoughts together.

282
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.64
But then he trained it over and over and over again.

283
00:22:54.64 --> 00:22:55.96
And he got better at it.

284
00:22:55.96 --> 00:23:00.72
And maybe by the time he got to me as a 23 year old Lieutenant J.G.

285
00:23:00.72 --> 00:23:05.72
He was like, oh, we're going to get in the hotel.

286
00:23:05.72 --> 00:23:07.72
I'll tell you guys what's going on.

287
00:23:07.72 --> 00:23:08.12
And so, you know, even though it appeared to me like it was natural, probably wasn't.

288
00:23:08.12 --> 00:23:09.12
It was probably a training.

289
00:23:09.12 --> 00:23:12.60
He had some natural capability, but he played football in his whole life.

290
00:23:12.60 --> 00:23:14.000
And that was that.

291
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Yeah.

292
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.40
So in a way, you can kind of, and this may be kind of interchangeable as far as the expression,

293
00:23:19.40 --> 00:23:25.20
but you know, you say natural capability, it could be that they gain it through learning

294
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:28.24
or whatever, just through their environment, you know, like as a kid.

295
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:32.48
Yeah, yeah, so playing football and then they'll bring it to the training situation and

296
00:23:32.48 --> 00:23:33.48
they'll excel.

297
00:23:33.48 --> 00:23:34.48
Yeah.

298
00:23:34.48 --> 00:23:37.08
But I think it's got to be a little bit of both, right?

299
00:23:37.08 --> 00:23:38.08
Yeah.

300
00:23:38.08 --> 00:23:39.08
And you will get better at it.

301
00:23:39.08 --> 00:23:43.76
But the more you focus on that particular skill, like some people aren't very comfortable

302
00:23:43.76 --> 00:23:44.76
talking.

303
00:23:44.76 --> 00:23:47.84
And you know, even they're not even comfortable talking in a conversation, right?

304
00:23:47.84 --> 00:23:48.84
Oh, yeah.

305
00:23:48.84 --> 00:23:51.56
And so if you end up with a kid like that, well, you got to get him out and socialize

306
00:23:51.56 --> 00:23:57.88
them and get him in front of people talking all the time and that will be good for them.

307
00:23:57.88 --> 00:24:02.68
If you have someone that's, if you've got a kid or, yeah, if you've got a kid or a young

308
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:07.24
leader that doesn't know when to shut up, right?

309
00:24:07.24 --> 00:24:09.12
How are you going to, because sometimes leaders are like that too.

310
00:24:09.12 --> 00:24:12.04
They want to hear themselves talk and they just keep talking all the time and guess what?

311
00:24:12.04 --> 00:24:13.96
The more you talk, the less people listen.

312
00:24:13.96 --> 00:24:17.36
So if I'm giving orders on every little thing that we've gotten to do in front of us,

313
00:24:17.36 --> 00:24:19.16
eventually you're not listening to me anymore.

314
00:24:19.16 --> 00:24:22.52
And when something critical comes up, you're still not listening to me because I've been

315
00:24:22.52 --> 00:24:27.44
talking for the past six straight months won't shut my pie hole.

316
00:24:27.44 --> 00:24:29.32
So that's a bad situation.

317
00:24:29.32 --> 00:24:34.56
So how do we get that person to quiet down?

318
00:24:34.56 --> 00:24:35.56
It's both.

319
00:24:35.56 --> 00:24:36.56
Yeah.

320
00:24:36.56 --> 00:24:38.06
All right.

321
00:24:38.06 --> 00:24:42.80
So now we're going to hear from a guy named Field Marshall, William Slam.

322
00:24:42.80 --> 00:24:44.84
I think Bill Slam is what they ended up calling him.

323
00:24:44.84 --> 00:24:51.32
He was in World War One and World War Two wounded multiple times.

324
00:24:51.32 --> 00:25:00.36
I think three times led the 14th Army in Burma World War Two and he also fought with the

325
00:25:00.36 --> 00:25:04.48
Anzac, so the Australian New Zealand Army Corps at Gallipoli.

326
00:25:04.48 --> 00:25:11.40
So you could say he's got a pretty good view of things.

327
00:25:11.40 --> 00:25:19.40
So he's this, believe it or not, the first this book kicks off with talking about morale

328
00:25:19.40 --> 00:25:21.08
and the morale of the troops.

329
00:25:21.08 --> 00:25:22.48
So here we go back to the book.

330
00:25:22.48 --> 00:25:24.44
Moral is a state of mind.

331
00:25:24.44 --> 00:25:29.60
It is that intangible force which will move a whole group of men to give their last

332
00:25:29.60 --> 00:25:36.44
ounce to achieve something without counting the cost to themselves.

333
00:25:36.44 --> 00:25:43.04
That makes them feel that they are part of something greater than themselves.

334
00:25:43.04 --> 00:25:45.08
Now this is interesting.

335
00:25:45.08 --> 00:25:46.96
So so he's talking about the importance of morale.

336
00:25:46.96 --> 00:25:52.64
Now going back to the subject we were just talking about back to the book, I learned

337
00:25:52.64 --> 00:25:58.40
two that one did not need to be an orator to be effective.

338
00:25:58.40 --> 00:26:01.40
Two things only were necessary.

339
00:26:01.40 --> 00:26:09.36
First to know what you were talking about and second and most important to believe it yourself.

340
00:26:09.36 --> 00:26:11.48
So there you go.

341
00:26:11.48 --> 00:26:15.80
You don't need to be a great orator, but you got to know what you're talking about and you

342
00:26:15.80 --> 00:26:18.08
got to believe it.

343
00:26:18.08 --> 00:26:23.68
Those are two really good places to start.

344
00:26:23.68 --> 00:26:25.40
He continues on talking about Moral.

345
00:26:25.40 --> 00:26:31.36
He says a most potent factor in spreading this belief in the efficiency of an organization

346
00:26:31.36 --> 00:26:33.72
is a sense of discipline.

347
00:26:33.72 --> 00:26:39.000
We tried to make our discipline intelligent, but we were old fashioned army and we insisted

348
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.92
on outward signs.

349
00:26:40.92 --> 00:26:44.76
We expected soldiers to salute and officers to salute in return.

350
00:26:44.76 --> 00:26:47.60
Both in mutual confidence and respect.

351
00:26:47.60 --> 00:26:51.76
I encouraged all officers to insist whenever possible and there were few places where it

352
00:26:51.76 --> 00:26:57.76
was not possible on good, turnout and personal cleanliness.

353
00:26:57.76 --> 00:27:02.08
It takes courage especially for a young officer to check a man met on the road for not properly

354
00:27:02.08 --> 00:27:08.92
saluting or for slavantly appearance, but every time he does, it adds to his stock of moral

355
00:27:08.92 --> 00:27:15.000
courage and whatever the soldier may say, he has respect for the officer who does pull him

356
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
up.

357
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.40
This is an interesting point.

358
00:27:19.40 --> 00:27:23.28
What we're talking about here is I see Ecos, not wearing his uniform correctly, so I'm

359
00:27:23.28 --> 00:27:28.32
going to go over and tighten you up.

360
00:27:28.32 --> 00:27:33.000
That is, you can see where people are probably thinking, yeah, Jack will be over that

361
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
guy.

362
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Right?

363
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
No, actually wrong.

364
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.08
And what I'm going to talk about here is I'm going to talk about what I call leadership

365
00:27:41.08 --> 00:27:42.60
capital.

366
00:27:42.60 --> 00:27:48.56
You only have so much leadership capital in your bank and you've got to decide what

367
00:27:48.56 --> 00:27:52.08
as a leader you're going to spend that capital on.

368
00:27:52.08 --> 00:27:58.12
And if I see you out of uniform or you're looking sloppy, I've got to decide if it's

369
00:27:58.12 --> 00:28:01.64
worth me investing my leadership capital and going over and telling you that you need to

370
00:28:01.64 --> 00:28:02.64
tighten it up.

371
00:28:02.64 --> 00:28:07.40
Go, you need to get that.

372
00:28:07.40 --> 00:28:07.72
Hey, Sergeant Charles, you need to get your uniform squared away.

373
00:28:07.72 --> 00:28:08.72
You look like crap.

374
00:28:08.72 --> 00:28:09.72
You're setting a bad example.

375
00:28:09.72 --> 00:28:12.28
Is that what I want to invest my leadership capital on?

376
00:28:12.28 --> 00:28:13.44
Now, can it be sometimes?

377
00:28:13.44 --> 00:28:14.44
Yes, absolutely.

378
00:28:14.44 --> 00:28:17.04
And we've talked about the many cases where that occurs.

379
00:28:17.04 --> 00:28:21.20
You know, when you look at at hack worth, when hack worth showed up the Vietnam as a

380
00:28:21.20 --> 00:28:25.92
battalion commander, he tightened up their uniform standards immediately.

381
00:28:25.92 --> 00:28:28.000
He tightened him up immediately.

382
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.60
He knew he needed to invest that leadership capital.

383
00:28:30.60 --> 00:28:33.000
He needed to start with the small things.

384
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.40
But if you're in a dearest in situation and you see somebody that maybe isn't doing

385
00:28:40.40 --> 00:28:43.72
their, isn't wearing their uniform properly and you decide you're going to go tighten

386
00:28:43.72 --> 00:28:47.000
them up, I'm not saying it's the wrong answer.

387
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.04
And as Lave Babin will tell you, it's not what you preach to what you tolerate.

388
00:28:50.04 --> 00:28:53.08
And so if you tolerate the guys looking like crap, they're just going to continue going

389
00:28:53.08 --> 00:28:55.20
down that hill of looking like crap.

390
00:28:55.20 --> 00:29:01.84
Now to me, there's a certain point that I won't let you go past.

391
00:29:01.84 --> 00:29:06.24
If you're a little out of the, out of the standard, maybe I'm going to let that one slide

392
00:29:06.24 --> 00:29:07.72
a little bit, right?

393
00:29:07.72 --> 00:29:10.92
But once you get to a point where you're looking like crap, well, guess what?

394
00:29:10.92 --> 00:29:13.28
I am absolutely going to tighten you up.

395
00:29:13.28 --> 00:29:14.52
And I'm going to explain to you why it's important.

396
00:29:14.52 --> 00:29:17.12
I'm not just going to go and yell at you.

397
00:29:17.12 --> 00:29:19.72
No, not happening.

398
00:29:19.72 --> 00:29:26.48
So you've got to be careful how you ration your, your discipline and your leadership capital,

399
00:29:26.48 --> 00:29:27.48
right?

400
00:29:27.48 --> 00:29:30.08
If you just run around yelling at everyone or getting an everyone's face for every

401
00:29:30.08 --> 00:29:34.000
little thing that they're doing pretty soon, you could look at that like well, pretty

402
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.16
soon, they'll, they'll be scared of making mistake.

403
00:29:37.16 --> 00:29:38.32
But that's, that's the point.

404
00:29:38.32 --> 00:29:40.12
Now you got people that are scared of making mistake.

405
00:29:40.12 --> 00:29:41.12
Yeah.

406
00:29:41.12 --> 00:29:46.32
Now you're cutting off their ability to, and they're desired to think freely.

407
00:29:46.32 --> 00:29:51.60
So the bottom line with this balance, you've got to stay balanced in these things and

408
00:29:51.60 --> 00:29:53.04
don't waste your leadership capital.

409
00:29:53.04 --> 00:29:54.40
I was talking to a guy there today.

410
00:29:54.40 --> 00:30:00.72
He was running a off site for his executive team.

411
00:30:00.72 --> 00:30:03.72
And I talked to him and he said, man, you know what?

412
00:30:03.72 --> 00:30:04.72
He was just junk.

413
00:30:04.72 --> 00:30:07.40
And I said, what happened?

414
00:30:07.40 --> 00:30:12.76
And he showed up the executive off site and he's in the company and he's the guy that's

415
00:30:12.76 --> 00:30:14.40
running the off site.

416
00:30:14.40 --> 00:30:18.48
And he gets there and he says, all right, guys, while we're here, no cell phones.

417
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:20.68
So everyone put your cell phones away.

418
00:30:20.68 --> 00:30:22.52
We need to focus the strategic meeting.

419
00:30:22.52 --> 00:30:25.12
We need to get this done.

420
00:30:25.12 --> 00:30:27.48
So the guys put their cell phones away.

421
00:30:27.48 --> 00:30:28.88
And they start the meeting.

422
00:30:28.88 --> 00:30:34.20
He says, five minutes into the meeting, the CEO breaks out a cell phone, starts looking at

423
00:30:34.20 --> 00:30:35.20
it.

424
00:30:35.20 --> 00:30:39.64
A minute after everyone sees that, you've got half the room looking at their cell phones.

425
00:30:39.64 --> 00:30:42.56
And he went, like, got kind of nuts on them.

426
00:30:42.56 --> 00:30:44.40
You know, this is man, what's going on?

427
00:30:44.40 --> 00:30:47.000
And people aren't even paying attention after the first hour.

428
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.36
He's this, you know, what's going on?

429
00:30:49.36 --> 00:30:54.24
And I said to him, I said, bro, let's look at what you just, so then he said, then he

430
00:30:54.24 --> 00:30:55.24
lost them.

431
00:30:55.24 --> 00:30:58.000
Like the meeting just went downhill.

432
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.32
And I said to him, let's talk about what you did.

433
00:31:01.32 --> 00:31:06.64
Because you invested your leadership capital for this important meeting on telling people

434
00:31:06.64 --> 00:31:08.24
to not use their cell phones.

435
00:31:08.24 --> 00:31:10.44
Did you tell him why?

436
00:31:10.44 --> 00:31:11.68
He's like not really.

437
00:31:11.68 --> 00:31:15.40
Did you explain to them when they would be able to use their cell phones?

438
00:31:15.40 --> 00:31:16.40
No, I didn't.

439
00:31:16.40 --> 00:31:20.84
So you just, now this company is a financial company.

440
00:31:20.84 --> 00:31:22.12
They've got a lot of things going on.

441
00:31:22.12 --> 00:31:26.44
You can imagine the CEO of a big financial company's got a lot of important calls and emails

442
00:31:26.44 --> 00:31:27.64
to check and all that.

443
00:31:27.64 --> 00:31:29.28
And all of a sudden he gets told, no cell phone.

444
00:31:29.28 --> 00:31:30.84
What is that going to end?

445
00:31:30.84 --> 00:31:34.48
What important thing is happening at my company today, where I'm not allowed to talk

446
00:31:34.48 --> 00:31:38.36
on my cell phone and answer emails or look at my emails.

447
00:31:38.36 --> 00:31:39.88
And I'm the guy.

448
00:31:39.88 --> 00:31:42.68
So when would I be able to look at you?

449
00:31:42.68 --> 00:31:44.20
You didn't tell me that.

450
00:31:44.20 --> 00:31:48.72
So he invested all of his leadership capital to get people to do no cell phones.

451
00:31:48.72 --> 00:31:50.04
And he spent it.

452
00:31:50.04 --> 00:31:52.04
And there wasn't any left.

453
00:31:52.04 --> 00:31:55.16
And so you have to be careful.

454
00:31:55.16 --> 00:31:57.28
Now you have to approach it the right way.

455
00:31:57.28 --> 00:32:00.76
First of all, you could say, hey, listen, guys, we're going to power through a solid

456
00:32:00.76 --> 00:32:02.16
hour right now.

457
00:32:02.16 --> 00:32:05.40
I'm going to ask you unless it's just critical.

458
00:32:05.40 --> 00:32:07.96
Keep your cell phones put away and let's power through this.

459
00:32:07.96 --> 00:32:09.68
Let's get some good conversation going right.

460
00:32:09.68 --> 00:32:12.52
And in an hour, we're going to take a 20-minute break where you can catch up on, you've got

461
00:32:12.52 --> 00:32:14.04
to catch up on.

462
00:32:14.04 --> 00:32:15.48
And then we'll do another hour off that.

463
00:32:15.48 --> 00:32:17.44
So now people understand what's happening.

464
00:32:17.44 --> 00:32:18.44
And they understand why.

465
00:32:18.44 --> 00:32:21.20
And by the way, if everyone's on their cell phones, we're not going to get what we need

466
00:32:21.20 --> 00:32:22.20
out of this meeting.

467
00:32:22.20 --> 00:32:23.20
So you've got to explain.

468
00:32:23.20 --> 00:32:26.08
And you don't want to invest your leadership capital on things that don't matter.

469
00:32:26.08 --> 00:32:31.68
So if you're the senior guy in a leadership position and you're focused on some little person

470
00:32:31.68 --> 00:32:38.20
that's out of uniform, and that's what your focus is, that's not a good focus to have.

471
00:32:38.20 --> 00:32:43.52
You should set the standard and your subordinate leadership all the way down to the front

472
00:32:43.52 --> 00:32:48.36
where you've got like you and me are peers and I don't let you.

473
00:32:48.36 --> 00:32:51.44
I'm not waiting for the boss to come by and tighten up uniform.

474
00:32:51.44 --> 00:32:52.96
I won't let you tighten up.

475
00:32:52.96 --> 00:32:55.64
I won't let you wear a crappy looking uniform.

476
00:32:55.64 --> 00:32:56.64
That's what I want.

477
00:32:56.64 --> 00:33:01.20
I want to have a gang mentality where we're self policing because the minute I'm from

478
00:33:01.20 --> 00:33:02.68
the top doing that again.

479
00:33:02.68 --> 00:33:03.96
Does this happen sometimes?

480
00:33:03.96 --> 00:33:04.96
Yes.

481
00:33:04.96 --> 00:33:08.72
I'm not setting out a black and white rule here.

482
00:33:08.72 --> 00:33:13.08
I'm giving the broad guidance that if you're hack worth and you're taking over a battalion

483
00:33:13.08 --> 00:33:16.44
where people's lives are at risks and you know that they're slack everywhere and they're

484
00:33:16.44 --> 00:33:19.60
not doing a good job, you've got to go in there and tighten them up and one of the best

485
00:33:19.60 --> 00:33:23.12
ways to do that is to go in there and start on the small things.

486
00:33:23.12 --> 00:33:27.96
But if you've got a functioning unit that there's nothing critical happening and you're

487
00:33:27.96 --> 00:33:33.72
trying to build that team into something that's a winning team and the first thing you

488
00:33:33.72 --> 00:33:38.16
could do is go in and focus on some of these small things when you haven't really established

489
00:33:38.16 --> 00:33:42.12
yourself, that could be problematic.

490
00:33:42.12 --> 00:33:45.96
So think about those things when you're in those positions.

491
00:33:45.96 --> 00:33:54.52
Alright, going back to the book, I do not say that the men of the 14th Army welcomed

492
00:33:54.52 --> 00:34:00.36
to difficulties, but they grew to take fierce pride in overcoming them by determination

493
00:34:00.36 --> 00:34:02.36
and ingenuity.

494
00:34:02.36 --> 00:34:08.72
From start to finish, they had only two items of equipment that were never in short supply.

495
00:34:08.72 --> 00:34:11.96
Their brains and their courage.

496
00:34:11.96 --> 00:34:18.56
They lived up to the unofficial motto, I gave them, God helps those who help themselves.

497
00:34:18.56 --> 00:34:24.24
And once again, that's the same thing that Colonel Bill Reader said.

498
00:34:24.24 --> 00:34:26.24
God help yourselves.

499
00:34:26.24 --> 00:34:29.92
Alright, now we're going to move on to still still talking about morale.

500
00:34:29.92 --> 00:34:37.76
We're going to talk to over here from Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.

501
00:34:37.76 --> 00:34:39.88
If you don't know who that is, Monti.

502
00:34:39.88 --> 00:34:43.24
What are you going to do?

503
00:34:43.24 --> 00:34:52.76
The Anglo-Iris war, the Palestine conflicts that disperse uprisings and World War II.

504
00:34:52.76 --> 00:34:57.84
He, you know, obviously ran the British 8th Army World War II.

505
00:34:57.84 --> 00:35:03.24
So once again, we've got a person with some very solid perspective on leadership and

506
00:35:03.24 --> 00:35:09.36
combat leadership, the quality of morale, back to the book in war, the moral stature of

507
00:35:09.36 --> 00:35:15.44
some men increases and their characters grow stronger and more closely knit in proportion

508
00:35:15.44 --> 00:35:19.32
to the discomforts and dangers they are called upon to face.

509
00:35:19.32 --> 00:35:20.32
Boom.

510
00:35:20.32 --> 00:35:22.08
So some guys get better.

511
00:35:22.08 --> 00:35:23.60
Some guys rise to the occasion.

512
00:35:23.60 --> 00:35:28.16
Back to the book, such men will occasionally perform in battle, remarkable acts of selfless

513
00:35:28.16 --> 00:35:33.68
courage and daring and will endure with extraordinary fortitude and patience.

514
00:35:33.68 --> 00:35:37.12
The burdens thrust upon them.

515
00:35:37.12 --> 00:35:43.44
Other men, however, will under the stress of hardships or dangers surrender to fear or

516
00:35:43.44 --> 00:35:48.44
fatigue and allow their characters to disintegrate.

517
00:35:48.44 --> 00:35:54.56
This disintegration will usually take the form of elucining of the moral fiber which results

518
00:35:54.56 --> 00:36:00.52
in timidity of action and slackness and appearance, while those who have gone to seed

519
00:36:00.52 --> 00:36:09.44
will be dirty and their appearance will be sluggish and will be slobvenly in these

520
00:36:09.44 --> 00:36:17.56
later cases there has been a general elucing of character due to partial surrender to fear.

521
00:36:17.56 --> 00:36:19.56
So I totally agree with this.

522
00:36:19.56 --> 00:36:28.24
You see in combat situations, people either get better or they get worse.

523
00:36:28.24 --> 00:36:32.88
Some people just kind of cruise, right, stay in that same zone but some people get better

524
00:36:32.88 --> 00:36:36.52
or they get worse, they rise the occasion or they fall.

525
00:36:36.52 --> 00:36:41.20
Back to the book, the good soldier, the man with high morale has not surrendered to fear

526
00:36:41.20 --> 00:36:44.36
and has maintained his personal standards.

527
00:36:44.36 --> 00:36:50.68
The bad soldier, the man with low morale, has become incapable of independent action and

528
00:36:50.68 --> 00:36:56.28
has to some extent shed a part of his human individuality.

529
00:36:56.28 --> 00:37:04.36
That's an interesting statement that the person that's incapable of independent action.

530
00:37:04.36 --> 00:37:10.40
He said he shed some of his human individuality.

531
00:37:10.40 --> 00:37:14.32
Back to the book, basic factors of morale, we now must consider the factors.

532
00:37:14.32 --> 00:37:19.76
What factors constitute morale of the soldier in the heat of battle?

533
00:37:19.76 --> 00:37:24.32
Certain factors may be described as essential conditions without which high morale cannot

534
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:26.92
exist.

535
00:37:26.92 --> 00:37:38.60
These four basic factors are one leadership, two discipline, three comradeship and four self-respect.

536
00:37:38.60 --> 00:37:46.12
Fifth factor devotion to cause must exist but need not necessarily influence all the soldiers.

537
00:37:46.12 --> 00:37:51.52
Finally, there are numerous contributatory factors which are of great importance but are

538
00:37:51.52 --> 00:37:53.84
not essential conditions.

539
00:37:53.84 --> 00:37:59.60
Starting with this first one leadership, morale is in the first place based on leadership.

540
00:37:59.60 --> 00:38:02.84
Good morale is impossible without good leaders.

541
00:38:02.84 --> 00:38:07.40
Human beings are fundamentally alike in that certain common characteristics apply to all

542
00:38:07.40 --> 00:38:10.04
men in varying degrees.

543
00:38:10.04 --> 00:38:15.52
In battle, the most important of these characteristics is fear.

544
00:38:15.52 --> 00:38:20.76
All men are afraid at one time or another to a greater or lesser extent.

545
00:38:20.76 --> 00:38:25.40
In moments of fear, they band together and look for guidance.

546
00:38:25.40 --> 00:38:34.52
They seek for a person to give decisions they look for a leader.

547
00:38:34.52 --> 00:38:43.76
The leaders power of decision results from his ability to remain calm in the crisis.

548
00:38:43.76 --> 00:38:51.000
His greatest asset is the ability to act normally in abnormal conditions to continue to think

549
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.20
rationally when his men have ceased to think to be decisive in action when they are

550
00:38:55.20 --> 00:38:58.40
paralyzed by fear.

551
00:38:58.40 --> 00:39:09.20
A little bit of normal face, from Monti, act normally in abnormal conditions, remain calm.

552
00:39:09.20 --> 00:39:14.72
Back to the book, the object of training must be first to select those who possess them

553
00:39:14.72 --> 00:39:20.48
within them the potentialities of leadership and secondly to develop these potentialities.

554
00:39:20.48 --> 00:39:23.72
This is accomplished by giving the leader responsibility.

555
00:39:23.72 --> 00:39:29.64
The leader's character will develop in proportion to the responsibility with which he has been entrusted.

556
00:39:29.64 --> 00:39:32.64
So there you go, he's saying the same thing that we were talking out earlier.

557
00:39:32.64 --> 00:39:38.20
You have certain potentials and you've got to develop those and how do you develop them?

558
00:39:38.20 --> 00:39:41.80
With people, you give people, you want to develop leaders, you give responsibility.

559
00:39:41.80 --> 00:39:46.16
You don't give them responsibility, that's going to kill them, but you give them responsibility

560
00:39:46.16 --> 00:39:49.40
that's going to definitely test them.

561
00:39:49.40 --> 00:39:55.12
And they're going to have to step up to be able to perform.

562
00:39:55.12 --> 00:40:01.40
Back to the book, the two vital attributes of a leader are A, decision, in action, and

563
00:40:01.40 --> 00:40:05.32
B calmness in crisis.

564
00:40:05.32 --> 00:40:10.16
Given these two attributes, he will succeed without them, he will fail.

565
00:40:10.16 --> 00:40:16.36
Our great problem in pieces to select leaders, it's to select as leaders, men whose brain

566
00:40:16.36 --> 00:40:24.36
will remain clear when intensely frightened.

567
00:40:24.36 --> 00:40:28.68
So from Monty, you've got to remain calm.

568
00:40:28.68 --> 00:40:30.40
Now he's going to talk about discipline.

569
00:40:30.40 --> 00:40:34.88
The objective discipline is the conquest of fear.

570
00:40:34.88 --> 00:40:36.80
There are two aspects of fear.

571
00:40:36.80 --> 00:40:40.08
Fear can suddenly attack a man through his imagination.

572
00:40:40.08 --> 00:40:46.32
A corpse in a ditch or a grave by the far side of the road will remind him of his position.

573
00:40:46.32 --> 00:40:50.000
He'll suddenly realize that he himself is liable to be killed.

574
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.64
It is a function of discipline to fortify the minds that it becomes reconciled to unpleasant

575
00:40:54.64 --> 00:41:00.04
sights and accepts them as normal everyday occurrences.

576
00:41:00.04 --> 00:41:04.84
Fear can also creep upon a man during periods of monotony on the line.

577
00:41:04.84 --> 00:41:11.28
At such time, he will have the opportunity to appreciate the dangers which beset his life.

578
00:41:11.28 --> 00:41:16.000
Fear acting through his thoughts can so reduce the man's hardcore of courage that he

579
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.28
will become nervous and fearful.

580
00:41:19.28 --> 00:41:23.68
Discipline strengthens the minds that it becomes impervious to the corroding influence of

581
00:41:23.68 --> 00:41:24.68
fear.

582
00:41:24.68 --> 00:41:30.32
It teaches men to confine their thought within certain definite limits.

583
00:41:30.32 --> 00:41:35.12
It instills the habit of self-control.

584
00:41:35.12 --> 00:41:36.12
That's pretty amazing.

585
00:41:36.12 --> 00:41:42.88
It's pretty amazing assessment to think that one of the best premier tools to overcome

586
00:41:42.88 --> 00:41:45.96
fear is discipline.

587
00:41:45.96 --> 00:41:52.36
Back to the book, discipline implies a conception of duty.

588
00:41:52.36 --> 00:41:56.20
Nothing will be accomplished in the crisis by the man without a sense of duty.

589
00:41:56.20 --> 00:41:57.20
Makes sense.

590
00:41:57.20 --> 00:41:59.56
Now, he's going to talk about comradeship.

591
00:41:59.56 --> 00:42:05.76
Back to the book, morale cannot be good unless men come to have affection for each other.

592
00:42:05.76 --> 00:42:12.32
A fellow feeling must grow up which result in a spirit of comradeship.

593
00:42:12.32 --> 00:42:15.24
And army is made of human beings.

594
00:42:15.24 --> 00:42:20.72
So that however much a leader may inspire his men, however perfect the discipline the morale

595
00:42:20.72 --> 00:42:28.000
will be hard and unsympathetic if the warmth of comradeship has not been added.

596
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:36.48
Yeah, you've got to be the hardcore disciplinarian but you need the warmth of comradeship.

597
00:42:36.48 --> 00:42:44.36
Back to the book, war, the hard business is not necessarily a grim one.

598
00:42:44.36 --> 00:42:52.28
Even must laugh and joke together must enjoy each other's company and must get fun out

599
00:42:52.28 --> 00:42:55.72
of even life.

600
00:42:55.72 --> 00:42:59.32
Must get fun out of life even in times of danger.

601
00:42:59.32 --> 00:43:02.48
So do you want to have a good time?

602
00:43:02.48 --> 00:43:05.56
Yes, you do.

603
00:43:05.56 --> 00:43:11.60
And the thing that makes these dangerous times more bearable is when you're having fun during

604
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:12.60
them.

605
00:43:12.60 --> 00:43:17.000
And that's one of the things I don't talk a whole lot about seal training in here on the

606
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
podcast, but one of the things that you do in seal training is you're doing miserable

607
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.48
things called wet tired and you're having fun the whole time.

608
00:43:23.48 --> 00:43:25.48
You're learning that, hey, guess what?

609
00:43:25.48 --> 00:43:30.52
I consider you're in be cold and it's miserable or I can be cold and I can laugh about it.

610
00:43:30.52 --> 00:43:33.88
And I can make fun of my friend the way he's shivering.

611
00:43:33.88 --> 00:43:36.12
That's what makes it bearable.

612
00:43:36.12 --> 00:43:38.36
And the same thing happens when you get overseas.

613
00:43:38.36 --> 00:43:45.08
When you joke about really dark things, dark sense of humor, that comes out real strong when

614
00:43:45.08 --> 00:43:46.72
you're overseas.

615
00:43:46.72 --> 00:43:52.28
And one of my buddies who was super paranoid, I've talked about them on here before the

616
00:43:52.28 --> 00:43:59.64
guys found a tube that had shipped like maps or something.

617
00:43:59.64 --> 00:44:03.92
And if you pulled the tube apart real fast, it sounded like a morgue or a morgue.

618
00:44:03.92 --> 00:44:04.92
Right.

619
00:44:04.92 --> 00:44:06.68
So they'd get outside his tent and he was super paranoid.

620
00:44:06.68 --> 00:44:12.48
We spent a little bit of time getting morgered and so he was a little on edge from that.

621
00:44:12.48 --> 00:44:15.36
So they'd go outside of his tent and you can hear through the tent.

622
00:44:15.36 --> 00:44:17.96
It's just a little piece of fabric and they'd go outside of his tent and they'd pull

623
00:44:17.96 --> 00:44:19.96
that thing and it would sound like a morgue through.

624
00:44:19.96 --> 00:44:22.76
They'd hear you hear you.

625
00:44:22.76 --> 00:44:25.32
He'd freak you know what the hell are you guys doing?

626
00:44:25.32 --> 00:44:29.96
No, you know at first you hear him like fall and like sit the ground and then you'd hear

627
00:44:29.96 --> 00:44:34.56
the giggling of the guys outside and then you'd hear him, costing everyone out.

628
00:44:34.56 --> 00:44:37.16
But yeah, but it was fun. It was fun. It was fun.

629
00:44:37.16 --> 00:44:38.16
It was too far.

630
00:44:38.16 --> 00:44:41.92
A little too far maybe. But everyone's having a good time and even him, you know, we'd

631
00:44:41.92 --> 00:44:46.36
get done and he would be come outside. You guys are bastards and we'd laugh about it.

632
00:44:46.36 --> 00:44:50.20
That's the kind of thing where you're, you got to have fun in these tough situations.

633
00:44:50.20 --> 00:44:52.72
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

634
00:44:52.72 --> 00:44:58.04
I think that's probably why you know like nowadays like contemporary companies they

635
00:44:58.04 --> 00:45:05.32
incorporate like you know, Jade's company, Frank Maldi got fuzball. Yeah, ping pong. I heard massive

636
00:45:05.32 --> 00:45:11.32
noises the other day. Kind of sounded like a motor fire. It wasn't quite motor fire, but

637
00:45:11.32 --> 00:45:15.96
there was something I didn't know what it was and they were they were in a nerf gun fire

638
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:20.44
fire fire. Yeah. And by the way, it was floppy. No way. They were doing it.

639
00:45:20.44 --> 00:45:24.12
Yeah, there was no cover to move happening. It was just all every man from self. I was

640
00:45:24.12 --> 00:45:30.36
disappointed. Yeah. But that's the, but they're like the reason right where it's, I mean,

641
00:45:30.36 --> 00:45:35.16
these are, I mean, conceptually it's the same thing. Obviously, you know, it's way different.

642
00:45:35.16 --> 00:45:38.36
No, actually it's way different, but it's not actually not. Right. When we're going through

643
00:45:38.36 --> 00:45:42.60
tough things in a business and a company have fun with it. And when I work with companies

644
00:45:42.60 --> 00:45:47.24
that are good, good companies and they're going through something tough, the ones that have

645
00:45:47.24 --> 00:45:52.04
good morale, the ones that are laughing, they're the ones that do better. Yeah. Who wants to

646
00:45:52.04 --> 00:45:56.84
go to work? Yeah. If you don't enjoy the people who work with you know, like why would you

647
00:45:56.84 --> 00:46:02.28
want to do that? You know, one of the, uh, I hate you can call it the worst job, but I was the

648
00:46:02.28 --> 00:46:07.24
atmosphere right? So every day I'm wearing a uniform, I'm sitting in a desk all day. I did it for

649
00:46:07.24 --> 00:46:14.20
13 months. It was just that part of it. It's, you know, even, it's just a miserable job, right?

650
00:46:14.92 --> 00:46:19.80
Luckily, first of all, the admels are great guy and I had a lot, we know, I joked around all the

651
00:46:19.80 --> 00:46:27.40
time with him and his executive assistant is a guy that I would literally not, I would go to a

652
00:46:27.40 --> 00:46:32.68
three weeks at a time and we wouldn't say one serious thing to each other. Just everything would be

653
00:46:33.32 --> 00:46:39.08
some joke about every, all the misery that we were going through and by misery, I just mean, you know,

654
00:46:39.08 --> 00:46:43.72
hours worth of meetings and traveling in all the time and being on the road and staying in

655
00:46:43.72 --> 00:46:48.52
crappy hotels and flights getting, you know, bumped and canceled and being held over and the

656
00:46:48.52 --> 00:46:52.76
the admels suitcase not showing up somewhere and he's supposed to go on stage. He doesn't have

657
00:46:52.76 --> 00:46:58.60
a uniform with them and like that's, you know, not fun. I guess what? I had fun the whole time and

658
00:46:58.60 --> 00:47:03.88
we'd be joking about, you know, I'd say, well, I guess I'm going to get take one again for the team and

659
00:47:03.88 --> 00:47:09.40
we'd be just laughing. So yeah, even in these situations that aren't fun, have you got to have fun with them

660
00:47:09.40 --> 00:47:13.80
and that definitely will help out your morale. And if you're in a leadership position and all you do is

661
00:47:13.80 --> 00:47:19.40
just better, you don't get, get drown in the misery that you're going through every single person

662
00:47:19.40 --> 00:47:23.48
that's with you is going to be going through the same thing. And so as a leader, you got to,

663
00:47:23.48 --> 00:47:28.20
once again, going back to the dichotomy leadership, you got to, you got to know when, okay,

664
00:47:28.20 --> 00:47:32.28
the guys are in too much stress. They're not having fun. I need to have fun. I need to start a

665
00:47:32.28 --> 00:47:38.28
nerf war in the office here. So guys loosen up and then there's times where, hey,

666
00:47:38.28 --> 00:47:42.04
guys are having too much fun. We got to tighten them up. Yeah. Yeah. Like, hey, guys, we got this to

667
00:47:42.04 --> 00:47:47.80
do. And so you got to ride that, that line and balance it out correctly. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool.

668
00:47:47.80 --> 00:47:55.64
Huh. Like, newer companies, companies, companies, notes are incorporating that element into the actual

669
00:47:55.64 --> 00:48:00.60
kind of, you know, you're talking about, yes, you're right. And there's companies nowadays that do it too much

670
00:48:00.60 --> 00:48:04.44
and all the stuff. Yeah. They can't get anything done. Yeah. They're messing around because everyone's playing ping pong.

671
00:48:04.44 --> 00:48:08.04
Right. Everyone's in the Lego room. Yeah. Because they got rooms now. It's like, oh, you

672
00:48:08.04 --> 00:48:11.96
know, and they're in think and they'll play with Legos because that relaxes your mind, I guess.

673
00:48:12.52 --> 00:48:16.92
Not me when I'm around Legos. I think I'm going to step on them. Sorry. Because I got kids.

674
00:48:16.92 --> 00:48:22.36
I'm stepped on Legos this night, man. So I don't like being around Legos. I got the PTSD from Lego

675
00:48:22.36 --> 00:48:27.88
stepping when I was, my kids were younger. Lego. You know, because you can't ever get your son enough

676
00:48:27.88 --> 00:48:32.44
Legos apparently. Correct. Because they just need everything. And when I was a kid, there was not that many

677
00:48:32.44 --> 00:48:39.40
different types of Legos. You had blocks. Right. Long ones and shorter ones. Right. Nowadays,

678
00:48:39.40 --> 00:48:44.04
you get Legos, but they have hands and horrors and machine guns and they got cool stuff,

679
00:48:44.04 --> 00:48:48.44
but they didn't Legos anymore. They're a little toys. But they still come with a little Legos.

680
00:48:48.44 --> 00:48:53.48
And they still hurt the bottom of their feet. They step on them. They are surprisingly sharp for kids.

681
00:48:53.48 --> 00:49:00.04
Major choice, you know? Major sharp. All right. Going back to the book, he's the other thing

682
00:49:00.04 --> 00:49:05.56
he's talking about self-respect. No man can be said to possess high morale if the quality of

683
00:49:05.56 --> 00:49:10.20
self-respect is lacking. And this is something that Dick Winner has talked about too. That self-respect

684
00:49:10.20 --> 00:49:15.56
and how that drove him. Soldiers must be encouraged to respect themselves at all times and under

685
00:49:15.56 --> 00:49:22.36
all condition. Self-respect implies a determination to maintain personal standards of behavior.

686
00:49:22.92 --> 00:49:28.52
A man who respects himself will allow neither himself to become slavily nor his quarters dirty.

687
00:49:28.52 --> 00:49:35.000
Even in action, he will take care to see that his personal appearance suffers as little as possible.

688
00:49:35.96 --> 00:49:41.16
It is the job of the non-commissioned officer to maintain this aspect of discipline.

689
00:49:41.16 --> 00:49:45.96
It is the function of the officer to encourage and instill self-respect.

690
00:49:47.64 --> 00:49:52.04
So, interesting. He breaks that down a little bit like I was talking about

691
00:49:52.68 --> 00:49:57.16
if I'm the senior guy and I'm around yelling at people about how they're looking. That's not good.

692
00:49:57.16 --> 00:50:00.84
That should be my subordinate leadership should be tightened and that stuff up.

693
00:50:07.64 --> 00:50:14.44
Okay, here's his conclusion. Again, this is Monty-Talken. In brief,

694
00:50:14.44 --> 00:50:20.84
high morale has been defined as the quality which makes men endure and show courage in times of fatigue

695
00:50:20.84 --> 00:50:29.000
and danger. The cultivation of morale depends on the training of leaders and in-cultation of discipline

696
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.76
the encouragement of comradeship and the infusing of self-respect.

697
00:50:36.76 --> 00:50:42.76
The leaders must have a belief in their cause and they must pay attention to numerous

698
00:50:42.76 --> 00:50:47.48
contributory factors of considerable but secondary importance.

699
00:50:47.48 --> 00:50:54.52
We live today in a scientific age but we soldiers have to remember that the raw material in which

700
00:50:54.52 --> 00:51:03.32
we have to deal is men. Man is still the first weapon of war. His training is the most important

701
00:51:03.32 --> 00:51:11.000
consideration in fashioning of a fighting army. All modern science is directed towards his assistance

702
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:20.44
but on his efforts depends the outcome of the battle. The morale of the soldier is the most important

703
00:51:20.44 --> 00:51:31.40
single factor in war. There's Monty and that can be said for just about any organization.

704
00:51:31.96 --> 00:51:37.000
What your organization is made up of is people and you hear that with businesses all the time

705
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.24
and our people are most important assets. That's generally going to be the case.

706
00:51:43.72 --> 00:51:47.000
Here's some now we get into the leadership. The actual leadership section. The interesting

707
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
again they start off with morale. That's the first chapter now they move into leadership.

708
00:51:52.76 --> 00:51:56.68
And you know clearly from what he just said morale is the most important thing in winning

709
00:51:56.68 --> 00:52:01.48
battle. I don't agree. I think leadership is the most important thing. Now his number one

710
00:52:01.48 --> 00:52:10.28
is number one factor in good morale is leadership. I guess you know you could see where we're

711
00:52:10.28 --> 00:52:15.80
coming from a different angle but my thought is a little bit different. My thought is the most important

712
00:52:15.80 --> 00:52:20.76
thing is leadership and I think that leadership covers other things just be besides the morale

713
00:52:20.76 --> 00:52:23.56
of the men because now we're talking about the strategy that you're using, the tactics that you're

714
00:52:23.56 --> 00:52:30.12
using, everything is covered by leadership. Including morale. Yeah so you guys are looking

715
00:52:30.12 --> 00:52:36.68
in it from not opposite but just varying perspectives where he thinks leadership is part of morale.

716
00:52:36.68 --> 00:52:41.40
You think I think we're all trying to leadership. Yes. I think you have identified the situation

717
00:52:41.40 --> 00:52:47.08
correctly. All right here's some more from Monti on leadership. I would define leadership as

718
00:52:47.08 --> 00:52:53.24
the will to dominate together with the character which inspires confidence.

719
00:52:53.24 --> 00:52:59.96
All leaders got to learn to dominate the events with surround him. He must never allow these

720
00:52:59.96 --> 00:53:06.04
events to get the better of him. He must allow nothing to divert him from his aim. He must always

721
00:53:06.04 --> 00:53:12.76
be on top of his job and be prepared to accept responsibility. So Monti is talking about

722
00:53:12.76 --> 00:53:21.40
ownership. Now what I have to caveat this with is you get these people at a single-minded

723
00:53:21.40 --> 00:53:25.96
right and that they're going to dominate everything that's going on around them and they do that

724
00:53:25.96 --> 00:53:34.36
from a tactical perspective, not from a strategic perspective. So for instance if you say I must never

725
00:53:35.16 --> 00:53:41.16
or I must dominate the events which surround me and must allow nothing to divert me from my aim.

726
00:53:41.16 --> 00:53:47.72
That can actually be problematic if it doesn't make strategic sense. Right so if I'm always

727
00:53:47.72 --> 00:53:51.32
worried about dominating everything that's going on around me and the thing that's going on

728
00:53:51.32 --> 00:53:57.56
around me isn't really that important. I'm wasting my time on it. So this has to this has to be

729
00:53:58.20 --> 00:54:03.48
sort of offset a little bit by that dichotomy of leadership which is yes you want to dominate

730
00:54:03.48 --> 00:54:09.56
what's going on but if what's going on is important you need to let it go. You need to just let it go a

731
00:54:09.56 --> 00:54:18.84
little bit. All right so now we're going to hear from Jim and by the way this book what this book

732
00:54:18.84 --> 00:54:24.12
serves to lead it's it's basically a bunch I should have said this in the beginning but it's

733
00:54:24.12 --> 00:54:29.32
it's a bunch of small excerpts bigger than quotes some of them are just quotes which I don't

734
00:54:29.32 --> 00:54:34.36
do a bunch of light cages reading quotes I do a couple I'm going to do a couple today but some

735
00:54:34.36 --> 00:54:39.24
of them are like you know two three four pages of peoples of views on leadership of which I'm

736
00:54:39.24 --> 00:54:44.60
pulling out some of the highlights and interestingly for the first time I was going through

737
00:54:44.60 --> 00:54:49.80
some of this and I was like you know what I'm actually it was something that I've said a million

738
00:54:49.80 --> 00:54:58.36
times and so I said you know what I'm not actually going to highlight this again because I've said

739
00:54:58.36 --> 00:55:03.32
it over and over again now clearly with discipline I just talked about it for 47 minutes and

740
00:55:03.96 --> 00:55:08.60
I probably always will when I get the opportunity but there's a lot more about this but there's

741
00:55:08.60 --> 00:55:13.08
all section on discipline we'll get to all right now we're going to talk we're going to hear from

742
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:21.000
General John Hackett again World War II African campaign it's part of Market Garden which is the

743
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.20
big airborne operation for World War II then here's what he says I am a soldier in speaking of

744
00:55:28.20 --> 00:55:35.000
leadership I do so as a soldier and when I think about it as any soldier often must I do so in the

745
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.24
context of battle pressures in battle are high and in battle as a consequence the problems of

746
00:55:43.24 --> 00:55:50.52
leadership stand out in bold relief and that's something very similar to what I say which is

747
00:55:51.96 --> 00:55:56.92
combat is like life amplified and intensified wrote that an extreme ownership and that's what I'm

748
00:55:56.92 --> 00:56:02.76
talking about and because it's that way it's very easy to identify what's going on with the leadership

749
00:56:02.76 --> 00:56:07.16
it's a very the the the problems of leadership stand out in bold relief he said it better than me

750
00:56:08.36 --> 00:56:13.48
back to the book but while battle may be unique the problems that it exposes are not

751
00:56:15.40 --> 00:56:18.28
right yes leadership problems and have been working for

752
00:56:19.72 --> 00:56:24.84
seven years with other companies and people that are not going to battle and guess what the

753
00:56:24.84 --> 00:56:31.64
problems that battle exposes are not unique to battle for leadership is concerned with getting people to

754
00:56:31.64 --> 00:56:39.24
do things and as most keenly needed when difficulties doubts and dangers are at their greatest

755
00:56:40.04 --> 00:56:45.80
in whatever sphere this is attempted the problems are essentially similar so anytime you got a team

756
00:56:45.80 --> 00:56:49.72
you got trying to make and do something the problems are pretty much going to be similar

757
00:56:51.80 --> 00:56:57.16
back to the book I said that leadership was concerned with getting people to do things what I meant

758
00:56:57.16 --> 00:57:07.24
was getting them to do things willingly so we don't want to just park orders of people that

759
00:57:07.24 --> 00:57:11.72
doesn't work doesn't work in business doesn't work on the battlefield will it work for five minutes

760
00:57:11.72 --> 00:57:17.16
yes it will well I can I yell at you and get you to do something yeah sure you're on monster.com

761
00:57:17.16 --> 00:57:24.84
looking for a new job and you get home back to the book a man really only gets a full response from

762
00:57:24.84 --> 00:57:30.92
the many leads by something approaching complete fusion of his own identity with the whole that

763
00:57:30.92 --> 00:57:37.48
he and they together form so think about that if you're in charge of something and you're a leader

764
00:57:37.48 --> 00:57:42.28
you need to become that thing you need to become that team you need to become that goal

765
00:57:43.48 --> 00:57:47.88
I like that one and you can see when people get possessed like you look at the modern business leaders

766
00:57:47.88 --> 00:57:56.20
today those are people that you know Steve Jobs he was the obsessed with the product that he was Apple

767
00:57:56.20 --> 00:58:05.08
and that's one of those things that was so beneficial. Elon Musk just like he is what he's trying to do

768
00:58:08.84 --> 00:58:13.88
back to the book successful military leadership is impossible without the leader's total

769
00:58:13.88 --> 00:58:21.32
engagement in the task in hand and to the group committed to his care for its discharge and what's

770
00:58:21.32 --> 00:58:26.92
interesting about that was talking to your brother J. Charles of not too long ago actually was

771
00:58:26.92 --> 00:58:34.28
pretty long going he and he said something to me and it was like a big revelation to him and he was

772
00:58:34.28 --> 00:58:39.96
very as a very he had a good way of saying what I'm just reading about right now we were talking

773
00:58:39.96 --> 00:58:43.40
about something he was going to meeting and he was going to be you know talking about something

774
00:58:43.40 --> 00:58:49.64
there were some controversy about whether we're going to go and and he said that the person that

775
00:58:49.64 --> 00:58:58.52
cares the most wins and that's a great statement and it's very true it's not 100% true

776
00:58:59.08 --> 00:59:06.20
put the the the percentage is very high up there because if I just care about something so much

777
00:59:06.20 --> 00:59:12.84
and I'm going to drive with it further than you if I care about this decision more than you do

778
00:59:13.48 --> 00:59:18.76
I got a really good chance of winning really good chance of winning yeah kind of seem to like

779
00:59:18.76 --> 00:59:25.96
that translates into any goal yeah any more you care about it the the more probability yeah I guess

780
00:59:25.96 --> 00:59:35.48
the only the only place where it becomes problematic is if I care about something you know at 97

781
00:59:35.48 --> 00:59:41.72
level 97 you care about with the the opposite decision you're also at level 97

782
00:59:42.44 --> 00:59:47.000
now we got an issue now we got a problem because we're both going to think we're going to win

783
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.76
and we both believe that we need to win so now we got an ego scenario going on and things become

784
00:59:52.76 --> 00:59:57.40
problematic and any of the where this just becomes stupid is in the when you hear people having

785
00:59:57.40 --> 01:00:02.60
political I would use an air quotes on that one political debates around something yeah

786
01:00:02.60 --> 01:00:08.84
you know this person totally believes 100% and this person totally cares 100% and they're

787
01:00:08.84 --> 01:00:12.60
going to go nuts on each other and they don't listen to anything that the other person says

788
01:00:12.60 --> 01:00:16.92
and you end up with a big disaster on your hands of nonsense yeah a lot of those

789
01:00:18.36 --> 01:00:24.28
what would be political diet that's another one yeah you know I was listening I was listening to

790
01:00:25.56 --> 01:00:31.24
our podcast and what we're talking about we're talking always talking about watching people in the

791
01:00:31.24 --> 01:00:36.44
news and that's a classic situation where you know you got somebody on a three minute segment

792
01:00:36.44 --> 01:00:40.44
and one person is you know the hardcore in this direction the other person is the hard

793
01:00:40.44 --> 01:00:45.64
corner of the direction they both care they both care a lot neither one of them is going to win

794
01:00:46.44 --> 01:00:53.96
they actually that that goes the next that's the next realization is that if you're going up

795
01:00:53.96 --> 01:00:59.80
against person that cares as much as you do you actually have to take a back step and find another

796
01:00:59.80 --> 01:01:03.56
way you have to flank them because you're not going to be able to win them by going ahead dead they

797
01:01:03.56 --> 01:01:08.60
care as equal to to you so you've got to find a new solution otherwise you know what you'll do

798
01:01:08.60 --> 01:01:14.44
expand all your ammunition charging machine gunnests and you'll die yeah that you don't want to do that

799
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.12
if you care as much as me and I don't have the same opinion I've got to flank you yeah a lot of these

800
01:01:20.12 --> 01:01:25.64
probably gonna let you think you just want the argument in order to flank you too by the way yeah yeah the

801
01:01:25.64 --> 01:01:31.56
again political related diet uh how to raise kids you know all these are all yeah when you

802
01:01:31.56 --> 01:01:35.96
hot button yeah you call it hot things that you're not supposed to talk to or talk about around

803
01:01:35.96 --> 01:01:41.24
the Thanksgiving dinner yeah they get heated real quick and you and a lot of times we're talking

804
01:01:41.24 --> 01:01:45.48
about you know people or not people but we talk about how much someone cares about it right

805
01:01:45.48 --> 01:01:50.68
and then you can a lot of times the things they get mixed up is how much you care about it

806
01:01:50.68 --> 01:01:56.36
versus how much you care about your stance on it yeah so there's some different but it's a different

807
01:01:56.36 --> 01:02:00.76
and wrap everything you got to put your ego into both those right that's the ego I don't want to admit that

808
01:02:00.76 --> 01:02:05.16
I'm wrong right that's what I do that that means you care about your stance so when you make about

809
01:02:05.16 --> 01:02:11.16
yourself them but if you care about the issue like if I said if I mean you were having a debate about

810
01:02:11.16 --> 01:02:16.60
kettlebell workouts or something and I like dumbbells you like kettlebell but I really care about

811
01:02:16.60 --> 01:02:22.92
the issue and the issue is what's the best exercises if I truly care about what the best exercise is

812
01:02:22.92 --> 01:02:28.12
and not about my stance on what to pick I'm gonna care about the real answer rather whether it's my

813
01:02:28.12 --> 01:02:32.84
answer or not so that's why I think like political all these other things they they have that and it is

814
01:02:32.84 --> 01:02:38.68
it's just like I said it's the ego natural thing but they wind up caring more about their stance on it

815
01:02:39.56 --> 01:02:44.52
then they do the actual issues you know for sure don't let that happen I'm going to let you

816
01:02:44.52 --> 01:02:49.88
know for that one so yeah the 90's said not 90's but the the person who cares the most wins

817
01:02:49.88 --> 01:02:57.08
doesn't apply to someone's individual stance on something it applies to you subject and it also

818
01:02:57.08 --> 01:03:01.32
doesn't apply to you know a G.J.2 match because I'm not really care about winning your thing

819
01:03:01.32 --> 01:03:05.96
about this the other day because that's another thing people say mental oh it's all mental and here's

820
01:03:05.96 --> 01:03:12.92
an example Alex Arnold who's a rock climber who just climbed L. Capitan in Yosemite which is 3000

821
01:03:12.92 --> 01:03:21.24
feet tall and if you will say oh it's all mental and and people say things you know if you want something

822
01:03:21.24 --> 01:03:29.48
bad enough you do it you put me on that rock there's a some crox move like 2000 feet up 2000 feet

823
01:03:29.48 --> 01:03:33.000
up that's really hard and you're smearing which is this technique and rock climbing where

824
01:03:33.56 --> 01:03:38.76
you don't and I've done it before and I'm like the lowest white belt I'm not even a white belt

825
01:03:38.76 --> 01:03:44.36
like like someone gave me my white belt and rock climbing I'm not like a legit but I know I've tried

826
01:03:44.36 --> 01:03:49.48
things I go to Yosemite and I'll play around on the rocks and everything but I've tried this thing

827
01:03:49.48 --> 01:03:54.28
it's called smearing and and you're basically just using the tread or just the bottom of your rock

828
01:03:54.28 --> 01:04:02.36
climbing shoes on flat granite and you can create enough friction that you can you can move up it

829
01:04:02.36 --> 01:04:08.76
and some people are really good at it I suck and you know you got to you got your hand hold

830
01:04:08.76 --> 01:04:14.12
your work and you're using your feet and it's really weird balance that you have to do because

831
01:04:14.12 --> 01:04:20.36
if you push too hard in the rocks you're feet slip off and if you don't push hard enough you don't

832
01:04:20.36 --> 01:04:27.56
get any lift so it's this really fine like balance you've got to have and apparently there's

833
01:04:27.56 --> 01:04:34.68
one move or this one series of moves on this climb that he did that you have to smear and of course

834
01:04:34.68 --> 01:04:40.28
this is very natural for him but apparently he climbed that section with a rope like six or seven times

835
01:04:40.28 --> 01:04:45.72
just to make sure it felt good and all that stuff here's my point even if it wasn't smearing

836
01:04:45.72 --> 01:04:52.68
part even if it was just holding on to rocks right at 2000 feet I would absolutely want really

837
01:04:52.68 --> 01:04:58.04
really badly to hold onto the rocks I don't have the muscular strength to do it I mean the

838
01:04:58.04 --> 01:05:04.92
things that he's holding onto are smaller than with the first pad of your fingers that's what

839
01:05:04.92 --> 01:05:10.76
he's holding onto the tiny and we were doing this the other day at my house remember that little

840
01:05:10.76 --> 01:05:15.24
thing you actually had bed had stronger grip than me on the on the climbing board that I have at my

841
01:05:15.24 --> 01:05:21.40
house but I could I could couldn't even hold on or I could hold on for five seconds and you like

842
01:05:21.40 --> 01:05:26.04
had no it did you hold onto the really small one yeah that's legit I can't even hold onto that thing

843
01:05:26.68 --> 01:05:32.68
so if I was 2000 feet up and I really really really really really really wanted to do it and I was

844
01:05:32.68 --> 01:05:38.04
all mentally in the game guess what I'm falling to my death because I don't have the strength to

845
01:05:38.04 --> 01:05:43.88
do it I don't have the physical strength and I need to build it and okay you could say and that

846
01:05:43.88 --> 01:05:48.52
that's might be an acceptance okay if you really have the mental strength and will to do it then

847
01:05:48.52 --> 01:05:54.12
you'll train train super hard but at that moment not gonna help me I'm falling to my death

848
01:05:54.12 --> 01:06:03.48
right yeah I think that's not a metaphor but like it's like it's a romantic thing yeah yeah

849
01:06:03.48 --> 01:06:10.12
you want it bad enough you can do it no actually not true I want to take the extreme version

850
01:06:10.12 --> 01:06:15.72
I want to stay alive I'm 2000 feet up I want really badly to stay alive it doesn't matter

851
01:06:15.72 --> 01:06:19.96
I can't get across that section I can't don't have the hand strength to do it not happening

852
01:06:19.96 --> 01:06:24.60
but they're making a movie about that I can't wait to see it about Alex Honoled climbing that rock

853
01:06:25.40 --> 01:06:30.12
Jimmy Chen is the famous kind of photographer guy that they went and documented the whole thing

854
01:06:30.12 --> 01:06:36.20
and apparently one of the articles said that during that crux moments Alex Honoled was like hey

855
01:06:36.20 --> 01:06:42.12
when we get to here just like back off with the cameras he apparently was like you know just back

856
01:06:42.12 --> 01:06:49.40
off the cameras when I go through you know section 94 alpha because I think he thought he didn't

857
01:06:49.40 --> 01:06:56.76
need any cameras around real close when he might fall to his death it's bad heavy yeah like

858
01:06:57.80 --> 01:07:03.88
or is it because it might break his concentration or both I don't know I don't know but that's

859
01:07:03.88 --> 01:07:12.68
crazy yeah have you ever been to your somebody no it's it's L capitan is 3000 feet straight up

860
01:07:12.68 --> 01:07:18.04
of granted it takes people three four five days to climb up it he climbed it in three hours and

861
01:07:18.04 --> 01:07:25.16
forty five minutes with a chalk bag and a pair of shoes it's ridiculous it's ridiculous it's ridiculous

862
01:07:25.16 --> 01:07:32.20
yeah it's completely ridiculous 3000 feet that's very tall echo you're trying to imagine it let me

863
01:07:32.20 --> 01:07:37.72
help me no I mean taller than anything you've ever seen it's taller than a skyscraper and

864
01:07:37.72 --> 01:07:44.76
right it's it's huge and he climbed it with no ropes that means there's no rest that means there's

865
01:07:44.76 --> 01:07:50.28
no break yeah and it means there's no mistakes you can't make a mistake if you make a mistake you die

866
01:07:51.80 --> 01:07:56.92
crazy very impressive I don't even know why we're talking about Alex Honoled right now

867
01:07:56.92 --> 01:08:02.76
oh because we're talking about mental will yeah whoever believes it the most yeah whoever believes

868
01:08:02.76 --> 01:08:07.56
the most wins oh cares about it sorry not believes yeah it's much as I care about staying alive

869
01:08:07.56 --> 01:08:12.76
I wouldn't be able to pull it off yeah I think in Jade's situation that it did make sense though

870
01:08:12.76 --> 01:08:18.36
you know because you're you know no I actually say it does make sense yeah it does make sense and that's

871
01:08:18.36 --> 01:08:22.20
why I was able to do a lot of stuff that I've been able to do in my career right when I was in the

872
01:08:22.20 --> 01:08:28.76
military a lot of the stuff that I was able to get done I was able to get done because I cared about

873
01:08:28.76 --> 01:08:34.44
it more than the reals okay yeah like you think you're gonna you know you think you're gonna

874
01:08:34.44 --> 01:08:42.20
outperform my task unit I care about this so much I don't care I care about this so much you're

875
01:08:42.20 --> 01:08:45.48
not gonna be able to compete with me yeah because you might think oh I'll get there at five

876
01:08:45.48 --> 01:08:49.000
a clock in the morning I've been there for an hour you might think I'm gonna have my guys drill this

877
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
ten times I'm gonna have my guys drill it twenty times I care about this too much for you to win

878
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.32
you can't beat me you can't beat me it's not gonna happen I care about this too much

879
01:08:57.32 --> 01:09:03.80
non-to-bad way non-to-selfish way I care about this I love this this is everything to me you know

880
01:09:03.80 --> 01:09:07.40
you have other things going on and you got your wife and you got your family and you got this other

881
01:09:07.40 --> 01:09:11.72
thing going on in your life and you got goals that you want I don't care about any of those things

882
01:09:11.72 --> 01:09:16.68
this is all I care about so therefore you can't compete with me and that's pretty cool it's a

883
01:09:16.68 --> 01:09:21.56
cool place to be and get overseas people are thinking about all these other things no you don't

884
01:09:21.56 --> 01:09:24.52
care about anything I don't care about anything else this is the only thing I care about

885
01:09:24.52 --> 01:09:31.80
hmm so it ends up getting boiled down to just not stopping right not not quitting not giving

886
01:09:31.80 --> 01:09:37.08
up yeah that definitely plays a role that definitely plays a role and of course there's got to

887
01:09:37.08 --> 01:09:43.40
be balance because if let's say I don't care about let's say you know my my focuses 100% my

888
01:09:43.40 --> 01:09:47.80
seal task unit but then I forget about the fact that we're working with other army units

889
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.04
right not only think I care about as my unit well no actually I need to care about the mission

890
01:09:52.04 --> 01:09:56.44
more right any care about our strategic where we're going strategically because otherwise I'm

891
01:09:56.44 --> 01:10:01.16
thinking I just want to get my guys taken care if I just want to get my guys more work I just want to

892
01:10:01.16 --> 01:10:07.48
get no actually I do what care what Trump's my care for the task unit was care for the mission

893
01:10:07.48 --> 01:10:11.48
of what we're trying to accomplish now luckily those two things are completely aligned so there was

894
01:10:11.48 --> 01:10:15.96
never any time where I was thinking oh should I do this to benefit the task unit or benefit the mission

895
01:10:15.96 --> 01:10:19.96
no no if it benefit the mission it benefit the task unit if it benefit the task unit benefit the

896
01:10:19.96 --> 01:10:25.56
mission period so I care about those things be here now a hard time compete with me and luckily

897
01:10:25.56 --> 01:10:30.68
in Ramadi there wasn't any competition we were all working together that's what's so amazing about it

898
01:10:30.68 --> 01:10:37.96
yeah was army marine corps us everyone was just working together to accomplish missions because

899
01:10:37.96 --> 01:10:44.28
that's what you get when you get a nasty battlefield you get people working together all right

900
01:10:47.48 --> 01:10:57.80
another piece this is a guy named general Montsell war is preeminently the art of the man

901
01:10:57.80 --> 01:11:05.48
who dares to take the risk of the man who thinks deeply and clearly of the man who when accident

902
01:11:05.48 --> 01:11:13.32
intervenes is not thereby cast down but changes his plans and disposition with the readiness of

903
01:11:13.32 --> 01:11:20.04
a resolute and reflective mind which so far as is possible has for scene and provided against

904
01:11:20.04 --> 01:11:27.32
difficulties there you go that's what we're talking about oh accident intervenes cool good

905
01:11:27.32 --> 01:11:37.72
I'm not cast down change plans adapt back to the book no now no man can inspire confidence in others

906
01:11:37.72 --> 01:11:43.96
who is not confident in himself and self confidence comes from knowledge a thorough understanding of

907
01:11:43.96 --> 01:11:49.40
modern weapons and organization tactics and the details of administration affecting all those

908
01:11:49.40 --> 01:11:54.84
under his command must therefore be acquired by every leader he must show his troops that he can

909
01:11:54.84 --> 01:12:01.80
plan soundly lead resolute and deal promptly and effectively with the unexpected in addition to gain

910
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:08.28
full confidence of his troops a leader must have their personal friendship and trust

911
01:12:10.84 --> 01:12:16.20
I like that again I've there was a there was a seal off so that once was briefing guys and

912
01:12:16.20 --> 01:12:22.52
said if you guys if you guys if you if your people like you they then they uh

913
01:12:22.52 --> 01:12:29.64
you're not doing a good job in not true he's actually saying they need your trust and

914
01:12:29.64 --> 01:12:35.96
personal friendship and trust yeah once you say something like that that even that you can't push

915
01:12:35.96 --> 01:12:40.44
that too far well of course yeah you've got a balance that you're not in the leadership you can't be

916
01:12:40.44 --> 01:12:47.24
such close friends that you're choosing that you're putting one person as more important than the

917
01:12:47.24 --> 01:12:56.28
mission or the team that's the dichotomy leadership okay now he puts together this

918
01:12:57.48 --> 01:13:03.80
list which yeah we're we're feeling pretty good about this one a short list to leadership given

919
01:13:03.80 --> 01:13:09.24
as follows perfect your military knowledge study the use of weapons their tactical handing

920
01:13:09.24 --> 01:13:14.92
the enemy's character and methods and way to make use of ground so I don't care what job you're

921
01:13:14.92 --> 01:13:22.20
in apply those right know your tools know the enemy know your competitor next study the man

922
01:13:22.20 --> 01:13:28.52
on your command know them well and be known to them gain their confidence by your knowledge

923
01:13:28.52 --> 01:13:35.40
energy and skill and by your interest in their welfare always be cheerful with them however you may

924
01:13:35.40 --> 01:13:42.60
feel teach yourself to think out reasoned appreciations leading to clever but uncomplicated plans

925
01:13:42.60 --> 01:13:50.60
quickly and unheardly so there you go keep things simple know your people get the I like

926
01:13:50.60 --> 01:13:57.72
to know your people get them to know you too yeah that's important next study methods of deception

927
01:13:57.72 --> 01:14:04.92
and make full use of them always aim misleading the enemy always seek surprise keep your object

928
01:14:04.92 --> 01:14:12.28
clearly before you concentrate your efforts and resources at the decisive point always think well ahead

929
01:14:14.12 --> 01:14:21.16
prioritize next cue work out the best methods of control in different tactical situations

930
01:14:21.16 --> 01:14:28.20
practice them constantly study the situation carefully don't waste any time make up your mind and

931
01:14:28.20 --> 01:14:34.52
stick to it get out your orders quickly make certain that everyone clearly knows what you intend

932
01:14:34.52 --> 01:14:43.32
to be done commander's intent maintain the initiative make opportunities and seize them at once I

933
01:14:43.32 --> 01:14:51.56
like that make opportunities why do I like that don't wait for them to come be prepared to take

934
01:14:51.56 --> 01:14:59.24
risks but don't be foolhardy know your commander's intention and act in accordance with it don't

935
01:14:59.24 --> 01:15:08.12
wait for orders in action is always wrong so there you go this is just reiterating things that

936
01:15:08.12 --> 01:15:15.80
I talk about all the time never take counsel of your fears think of the enemies difficulties and how

937
01:15:15.80 --> 01:15:21.64
you can take advantage of them remember that it is will power that wins oh he's he's going

938
01:15:21.64 --> 01:15:29.32
off and we're not talking about carry it's not about will which will goes a long way never relax your

939
01:15:29.32 --> 01:15:36.04
efforts until victory is one attend to the comfort of the troops before you think of your own

940
01:15:36.76 --> 01:15:44.60
this is all just phenomenal stuff be loyal to your superiors and your subordinates express your

941
01:15:44.60 --> 01:15:51.56
views clearly and frankly but when a decision has been reached fully supported and stop all criticism

942
01:15:53.24 --> 01:15:59.56
never take shelter behind others when things for which you are responsible have gone wrong

943
01:16:01.56 --> 01:16:09.24
take some ownership oh I like this one refrain from jealousy resentment and self-seeking

944
01:16:09.24 --> 01:16:19.24
be tactful never make friction be thoughtful and consider it but maintain firm discipline

945
01:16:20.28 --> 01:16:23.80
think about how bad this thing about the dichotomy of that be thoughtful and consider it

946
01:16:23.80 --> 01:16:32.44
but maintain firm discipline never order troops to do what you are not prepared to do yourself

947
01:16:32.44 --> 01:16:43.80
never give an unnecessary order that's a good one think about that one never give an unnecessary

948
01:16:43.80 --> 01:16:50.76
order and I'll tell you why I like that one is because if you're doing a good job as a leader

949
01:16:50.76 --> 01:16:57.16
orders should barely even be necessary they should barely even be necessary I talked about this

950
01:16:57.16 --> 01:17:04.20
with life the other day I mean I'm sure we could go back through you know the history of

951
01:17:04.20 --> 01:17:09.000
tasking of bruiser but as we we were having a conversation we were working with a company

952
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.40
I don't think I ever gave an order to either one of my two Patoon commanders either life or

953
01:17:17.40 --> 01:17:22.92
the Delta Patoon commander I don't think I ever said this is what you're going to do that's an order

954
01:17:22.92 --> 01:17:36.76
like you see in the movies right I'm sure it's been said to me before more like an

955
01:17:36.76 --> 01:17:41.32
admit like not a administrative situation I don't know if anyone's ever said it to me before

956
01:17:41.32 --> 01:17:45.64
like that's an order I don't know if I'm trying to think of there's been some situation where

957
01:17:45.64 --> 01:17:50.52
someone said to me like hey basically like you've pushed far enough jocco stand down

958
01:17:50.52 --> 01:17:56.92
like I got one of those before like hey we get it jocco you care about this a lot it's not happening

959
01:17:56.92 --> 01:18:02.68
stand down I've got some I especially got those little younger like when I was a young and

960
01:18:02.68 --> 01:18:07.56
listed guy the driving with an idea I just be wanting to crush it and and people would be kind of

961
01:18:07.56 --> 01:18:12.36
saying hey well know we can't well and I be like no why can't why can't we why why why why won't

962
01:18:12.36 --> 01:18:16.20
we do this we need to do this this is the smart thing to do you know so I think to do and I

963
01:18:16.20 --> 01:18:22.92
would just eventually get like the little hey stand down we're not doing it okay you know what I'm

964
01:18:22.92 --> 01:18:29.16
gonna do become an officer I want to listen to you anymore so yeah I've got I think I've got a

965
01:18:29.16 --> 01:18:34.68
couple stand downs in my time stand down that's an order yeah that's an order that when you

966
01:18:34.68 --> 01:18:39.24
think about or anyway when I think but it's it really does seem like a movie line yeah and one thing

967
01:18:39.24 --> 01:18:43.96
is that means that you have not done a good job as a leader if I have to say that's an order

968
01:18:43.96 --> 01:18:47.56
that means I haven't done a good job as a leader that means you don't understand the mission you

969
01:18:47.56 --> 01:18:52.20
don't understand the intent you don't understand I haven't conveyed it to you properly and the

970
01:18:52.20 --> 01:18:56.76
only way I can get you to listen is by saying that's an order yeah pulling rank yeah pulling rank

971
01:18:56.76 --> 01:19:05.40
on you that's not a good not a good situation back to the book never overlook failure to carry one

972
01:19:05.40 --> 01:19:14.52
out so it's never given unnecessary order never overlook failure to carry one out some people have

973
01:19:14.52 --> 01:19:20.52
to chime in with their opinions on that one never overlook failure to carry one out

974
01:19:23.48 --> 01:19:27.88
I'm not sure on that one what does that mean to carry one out that's what I'm saying I don't know

975
01:19:27.88 --> 01:19:32.52
it says it says never order troops to do what you're not prepared to do yourself never given

976
01:19:32.52 --> 01:19:40.28
unnecessary order never overlook failure to carry one out to carry out an order yeah to carry one out

977
01:19:40.28 --> 01:19:46.36
never overlook failure to carry one out I'm not sure what he means by that just do

978
01:19:46.36 --> 01:19:51.48
book I'm sure some people will give us some opinions on that one on the Facebook you when I release

979
01:19:52.68 --> 01:20:00.36
keep fit yourself and make certain that your men do too keep your own nerves under control

980
01:20:00.36 --> 01:20:08.76
and study your men's good for like when you want to comment if you're listening and you want to

981
01:20:08.76 --> 01:20:14.92
comment you have an opinion on that one put it on the Facebook post so it can follow the conversation

982
01:20:14.92 --> 01:20:19.88
as opposed to Twitter which is 140 characters you don't know me oh yeah it's easier to see it on

983
01:20:19.88 --> 01:20:25.48
Facebook when there's a legit question or someone has some legit big feedback if you put it on the

984
01:20:25.48 --> 01:20:31.88
thread for podcast number 81 when I post it that's the place to put it there in the replies

985
01:20:32.68 --> 01:20:38.44
when I can like convert back on that subject without having to go through 17,000 tweets yeah

986
01:20:38.44 --> 01:20:43.96
I mean go back and forth and just carry play the him but not him yeah yeah so it's all laid out on Facebook

987
01:20:43.96 --> 01:20:49.56
so it's a good place to have those little conversations Twitter we have different kinds of conversations

988
01:20:49.56 --> 01:20:57.24
sure last of all remember that success in word depends more than anything else on the will to win

989
01:20:59.16 --> 01:21:06.12
cool again now we got Monti saying Morales the most important we got Jocco saying leadership is

990
01:21:06.12 --> 01:21:14.28
the most important and you got Brigadier general Montsell saying that the will to win is the most important

991
01:21:14.28 --> 01:21:21.24
I'm not gonna actually argue with either one of these guys yeah it's guys are all uh got all kinds of

992
01:21:21.24 --> 01:21:30.68
experience about much more intense than mine speaking of intense experience more than mine

993
01:21:30.68 --> 01:21:39.48
there's a guy a pseudonym meaning a fake name basilisk in the guy wrote something called

994
01:21:39.48 --> 01:21:46.92
talks on leadership and the guy's actual name was Alfred Bern and he was a world war one

995
01:21:46.92 --> 01:21:53.56
and world war two veteran then he was a military historian and he's got a little section in here

996
01:21:53.56 --> 01:22:00.20
it's called being straight there's one trait in the character of a leader that above all things

997
01:22:00.20 --> 01:22:08.92
really counts and it perhaps counts in war even more than in peace being straight no amount of

998
01:22:08.92 --> 01:22:17.48
ability knowledge or cunning can ever make up for not being straight once those under him find out that

999
01:22:17.48 --> 01:22:22.52
a commander is absolutely straight in all those dealings with them and free from the slightest trade

1000
01:22:22.52 --> 01:22:27.88
of self interest other than the self interest of which we are all guilty when striving for victory

1001
01:22:27.88 --> 01:22:33.96
of causes we believe to be right they will love him as their leader trust him work for him follow

1002
01:22:33.96 --> 01:22:42.12
him and should the occasion arise die for him with the fundamental ability of the British soldier

1003
01:22:42.12 --> 01:22:50.36
which comes to the surface when things are at their worst so being straight with your people

1004
01:22:51.32 --> 01:23:01.88
very important very important in fact perhaps his most important above all so now we got another

1005
01:23:01.88 --> 01:23:08.76
fact or that's the most important thing now I'm gonna hear a little on leadership from field

1006
01:23:08.76 --> 01:23:17.48
martial lord harming once again world war one and world war two veteran he also

1007
01:23:18.52 --> 01:23:27.08
fought in the second battle of al-amine he was a wounded lost some fingers recovered got back to

1008
01:23:27.08 --> 01:23:32.52
the fight so he says about leadership here there are some people who believe that leadership is

1009
01:23:32.52 --> 01:23:38.36
something which is inborn or which you acquire automatically at a public school but neither of those

1010
01:23:38.36 --> 01:23:42.52
things are true there are certain fundamental qualities which affect leadership in which depend to

1011
01:23:42.52 --> 01:23:48.44
very large extent on upbringing and the moral and spiritual values which you can learn which you

1012
01:23:48.44 --> 01:23:55.08
learn in your family and in your environment as a young man but there's no special way nor is there

1013
01:23:55.08 --> 01:24:04.12
any special cast or class which has the prerogative of leadership there are many forms of leadership

1014
01:24:04.12 --> 01:24:09.000
political parties have their leaders every big organization and industry or commerce all have their

1015
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.80
leaders and at the other end of the scale so do dance bands and so do gangs of thieves and smugglers

1016
01:24:17.08 --> 01:24:22.92
there are many qualities that apply equity to every type of leader but you and I are concerned

1017
01:24:22.92 --> 01:24:29.000
with one particular type of leadership to my mind the highest type of all and that is leadership

1018
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.68
on the battlefield and I believe it to be the highest type because it has to be exercised

1019
01:24:34.68 --> 01:24:41.64
under conditions of great difficulty and considerable danger I would like to be quite I would like

1020
01:24:41.64 --> 01:24:46.60
you to be quite clear about the conditions under which you will have to exercise leadership

1021
01:24:46.60 --> 01:24:54.68
you will frequently be tired you may also be cold and wet and hungry and thirsty you may be

1022
01:24:54.68 --> 01:25:00.60
dripping with sweat or you may be freezing with cold you won't know precisely what is going on

1023
01:25:01.80 --> 01:25:07.32
you won't know exactly where the enemy is you certainly won't know what he is going to do

1024
01:25:07.32 --> 01:25:14.20
or what his capabilities are of doing anything you may not know where your own people are

1025
01:25:14.20 --> 01:25:20.76
or what they are going to do to put it briefly you've got to be able to exercise leadership

1026
01:25:20.76 --> 01:25:27.000
in conditions of fatigue and fear uncertainty and ignorance and often in isolation

1027
01:25:28.68 --> 01:25:34.04
that is what makes it extremely difficult and that is why leadership on the battlefield calls

1028
01:25:34.04 --> 01:25:42.52
in my view for the highest qualities many qualities are required and leader different people

1029
01:25:42.52 --> 01:25:47.96
have different views about which are more important in my opinion there are five outstanding

1030
01:25:48.84 --> 01:25:54.68
mental and physical moral and spiritual qualities without which you cannot hope to be successful

1031
01:25:54.68 --> 01:26:02.12
and a good leader on the battlefield the first of those qualities is a mental and physical one and that

1032
01:26:02.12 --> 01:26:14.20
is fitness absolute fitness of mind and body so make sure you're getting your morning physical training

1033
01:26:14.20 --> 01:26:24.60
in physical fitness mental fitness next then I would say you've got to have complete integrity

1034
01:26:24.60 --> 01:26:29.48
you've got to be honest not only with yourselves but with the men you lead and the people with whom

1035
01:26:29.48 --> 01:26:37.32
you work and honesty and integrity are things that you cannot compromise with you cannot alter

1036
01:26:37.32 --> 01:26:43.72
if you do you will lose confidence and you will not be able to lead you must have complete integrity

1037
01:26:45.24 --> 01:26:55.32
so that's the same thing as being straight not after that not in any

1038
01:26:55.32 --> 01:27:02.36
next after that not in any order of priority but this is how I have put them down deep in my mind

1039
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.80
there is an enduring courage pretty well everyone can be brave for a few minutes most of us can

1040
01:27:09.80 --> 01:27:16.04
if we steal ourselves to it take one pledge or make one decision or incur one risk but the

1041
01:27:16.04 --> 01:27:21.72
sort of courage you must have to lead on the battlefield isn't enduring courage and one that you

1042
01:27:21.72 --> 01:27:28.60
will go that will go on when other people falter one that will enable you to do what you know to be

1043
01:27:28.60 --> 01:27:34.68
right irrespective of the danger or the difficulty contrary often contrary to the advice of well

1044
01:27:34.68 --> 01:27:45.000
meaning friends so got to have courage next then you must have daring initiative

1045
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.56
initiative means doing right away what you might if you had time think of doing a few minutes

1046
01:27:53.56 --> 01:28:01.80
later I like this if you wait for things to happen to you they will happen all right

1047
01:28:03.48 --> 01:28:10.04
and here I am quoting the words of my predecessor also spoken here they will happen to you

1048
01:28:10.04 --> 01:28:16.76
but they won't be what you like and they certainly won't bring you success initiative means

1049
01:28:16.76 --> 01:28:21.80
seeing at once and very quickly what needs to be done making up your mind to do it and then

1050
01:28:21.80 --> 01:28:29.56
seeing it through to the middle of bitter end so I love that one if you wait for things to happen to you

1051
01:28:30.60 --> 01:28:31.88
they certainly will

1052
01:28:31.88 --> 01:28:40.36
little bit more on will power here then you must have undonited will power the will power

1053
01:28:41.56 --> 01:28:48.36
is the motive power it is what enables you to make yourself fit in mind and body

1054
01:28:48.36 --> 01:28:53.56
to produce in you in your heart the courage the enduring courage that I spoke of

1055
01:28:53.56 --> 01:28:58.44
to give you the courage to do your duty and to make the sacrifice that may be called from you

1056
01:28:58.44 --> 01:29:05.16
it is the will power that forces you to take the initiative to make the plan to do what is required

1057
01:29:05.16 --> 01:29:13.16
to see it through and that will power must be undonited it must never allow itself to be overcome or

1058
01:29:13.16 --> 01:29:20.60
subdued perhaps the finest example living today of the power and influence for good of man

1059
01:29:20.60 --> 01:29:26.76
with undonited will power is our prime minister in one of the critical periods of the last war

1060
01:29:26.76 --> 01:29:33.08
he spoke certain words I am going to quote you now he said all the great struggles in history have

1061
01:29:33.08 --> 01:29:41.08
been won by superior will power resting victory in the teeth of odds or upon the narrowest of margins

1062
01:29:43.08 --> 01:29:48.68
it is the will power that is superior that can rest victory in the teeth of odds

1063
01:29:48.68 --> 01:29:55.16
that is the type of will power that has got to be developed in a leader on the battlefield

1064
01:30:00.60 --> 01:30:08.52
mobilize your will now he talks about some other qualities he talks about knowledge he talks

1065
01:30:08.52 --> 01:30:14.84
about judgment he talks about team spirit saying because you cannot get success on the battlefield

1066
01:30:14.84 --> 01:30:23.56
by yourself you've got to work with other people so obviously as a leader you have to have that

1067
01:30:23.56 --> 01:30:31.32
spirit of teamwork and closing out he says there's one other thing I would like to say to you

1068
01:30:35.64 --> 01:30:42.60
as british officers you will never have all you want all you need you'll be short of this or that

1069
01:30:42.60 --> 01:30:47.88
or the other sometimes you will be short of men other times your equipment or weapons may not be as

1070
01:30:47.88 --> 01:30:54.60
good as you think they ought to be normally you have as many as you would like you may be short of ammunition

1071
01:30:54.60 --> 01:31:01.64
you may also be short of food and water or other necessary things when these circumstances arise

1072
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:08.04
as they do often throughout your service both in peace and war there's only one motto and that is to

1073
01:31:08.04 --> 01:31:15.80
make certain that you do the very best you can with what you got don't belgate about what you have not

1074
01:31:15.80 --> 01:31:24.68
got but get on and make certain you do your utmost with what you have got now to sum up what I've

1075
01:31:24.68 --> 01:31:32.44
tried to say this afternoon I would like to put it like this first keep fit absolutely fit then be honest

1076
01:31:32.44 --> 01:31:38.36
honest with yourselves and honest with those with whom you work then have courage and make it an

1077
01:31:38.36 --> 01:31:45.16
enduring courage next be bold be daring and when there's a choice take the bold and daring course

1078
01:31:46.84 --> 01:31:53.88
make the very most of what you have got and never never never give in

1079
01:31:53.88 --> 01:32:08.44
yes do what you can with what you've got until you really like that one yeah yeah sometimes it

1080
01:32:08.44 --> 01:32:20.92
starts hitting all right next there's a chapter in this book which is called discipline which makes me

1081
01:32:20.92 --> 01:32:30.68
very happy and again I tried to censor myself from not just doing the entire chapter obviously you

1082
01:32:30.68 --> 01:32:38.44
can buy this book if you want to see the whole thing there's a great point this first one is from

1083
01:32:38.44 --> 01:32:47.96
field marshal Earl Wavel who was in the blue wars and he was in World War I in World War II

1084
01:32:47.96 --> 01:32:55.48
lost his left eye in the battle of e-brays so we're talking a warrior here that was went back for

1085
01:32:55.48 --> 01:33:03.16
service here's what he said about discipline discipline is teaching which makes a man do something

1086
01:33:03.16 --> 01:33:10.44
which he would not unless he had learned that it was the right the proper and the expedient thing to do

1087
01:33:10.44 --> 01:33:20.76
at its best it is instilled and maintained by pride in one's self in one's unit in one's

1088
01:33:20.76 --> 01:33:29.08
profession only at its worst by fear of punishment so he's talking we want self discipline we

1089
01:33:29.08 --> 01:33:33.40
don't want in post discipline that's what he's saying you don't want I don't want you doing this

1090
01:33:33.40 --> 01:33:37.56
because you're scared of me if you don't do what I tell you I'm gonna beat you that's not what

1091
01:33:37.56 --> 01:33:43.88
I want I want you saying I'm gonna do this because I want to do it here's a little something from

1092
01:33:43.88 --> 01:33:48.68
Monti here and we're gonna get some disagreements going I'm gonna disagree with Monti sorry Monti

1093
01:33:48.68 --> 01:33:56.52
well she were here to defend yourself okay on discipline Monti the basis of training must be self

1094
01:33:56.52 --> 01:34:04.76
discipline cool a man must learn to be the master of himself and to keep in subjection the bad

1095
01:34:04.76 --> 01:34:12.12
qualities in his makeup I love that self discipline can be developed by training in such things as

1096
01:34:12.12 --> 01:34:20.36
conception of duty self control self respect endurance and so on we then have collective discipline

1097
01:34:20.36 --> 01:34:24.84
and there's no doubt that the initial training in this subject is best carried out by drill

1098
01:34:24.84 --> 01:34:37.08
men must be taught instinctively to obey orders whatever they are I do not believe men will

1099
01:34:37.08 --> 01:34:44.92
fight voluntarily for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline the best form of discipline

1100
01:34:44.92 --> 01:34:51.80
is subordination of self for the benefit of the community so I'm gonna make some comments on those

1101
01:34:51.80 --> 01:35:00.44
number one when you say that you should obey orders regardless of what they are don't agree

1102
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.68
I don't agree with that I want my men to question my orders I want them to if I'm telling

1103
01:35:06.68 --> 01:35:11.000
you to do something that they don't think is smart I want them to question me I want them to come

1104
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.68
up with then a better solution that's how we're gonna win even the moral thing too right

1105
01:35:16.68 --> 01:35:26.36
like to obey orders regardless oh yeah for sure I want my whole team to be hey if this is the

1106
01:35:26.36 --> 01:35:33.40
wrong thing to do we shouldn't be doing it yeah next the other one he says here is

1107
01:35:34.92 --> 01:35:39.24
he says that people won't fight for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline I don't believe that

1108
01:35:39.24 --> 01:35:46.68
that's true either and I think if you look at American history guys we didn't have this

1109
01:35:46.68 --> 01:35:51.40
stricler of course there's there's discipline of course in the military there's imposed discipline

1110
01:35:51.40 --> 01:35:59.16
in the military but the things that people and all soldiers have accomplished without stricting

1111
01:35:59.16 --> 01:36:04.52
pose discipline is they've given their lives over and over no thousands and thousands and thousands

1112
01:36:04.52 --> 01:36:11.96
hundreds of thousands of cases where men have given their lives not because not because I said

1113
01:36:11.96 --> 01:36:17.96
or because the leader said go and charge this machine gun nest that's that's that's not why they did it

1114
01:36:17.96 --> 01:36:24.60
they did it because they believed in the cause hmm so I don't agree with that when I think that

1115
01:36:24.60 --> 01:36:31.08
men will fight voluntarily for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline and you know when I think

1116
01:36:31.08 --> 01:36:38.92
they do it I think they do it when that causes freedom so when the cause is freedom I believe

1117
01:36:38.92 --> 01:36:49.000
men will fight without the bonds of discipline over them and this idea that the best form of

1118
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.24
discipline is the subordination of self for the benefit of the community I don't actually

1119
01:36:53.24 --> 01:36:59.88
agree without one either I think the best form of discipline is when there is alignment in the

1120
01:36:59.88 --> 01:37:10.04
discipline the discipline for the team and the individual bring success and survival and freedom

1121
01:37:10.76 --> 01:37:16.76
and when those things are aligned that's when I think you get the finest form of discipline

1122
01:37:17.72 --> 01:37:25.40
now he recovers a little bit from my criticism here and of course to everyone that is

1123
01:37:25.40 --> 01:37:32.20
wondering why I'm sort of making fun of myself it's pretty embarrassing to be sitting here

1124
01:37:33.08 --> 01:37:37.72
and disagreeing with a guy like Monti so please don't take me the wrong way

1125
01:37:39.32 --> 01:37:46.28
just giving my opinion here and I'm in no way comparing my military knowledge

1126
01:37:46.28 --> 01:37:53.48
with general Montgomery and he doesn't say this the basis of all discipline is self discipline

1127
01:37:55.32 --> 01:38:01.64
which this is beautiful when I agree with that 100% this self discipline may come from within a person

1128
01:38:01.64 --> 01:38:08.68
or may be imposed upon him from without don't agree not only last a little while whatever it's

1129
01:38:08.68 --> 01:38:19.88
or it involves the idea of self control and self restraint that is true but there is I think it's called

1130
01:38:22.12 --> 01:38:28.76
situational discipline I think or what is that I could I could have the expression wrong but I think

1131
01:38:28.76 --> 01:38:38.84
it is situational just meaning like if you're in a certain situation you'll have you'll be really self

1132
01:38:38.84 --> 01:38:43.80
discipline but once you get out you're not you know like you ever you ever watched

1133
01:38:44.44 --> 01:38:51.80
you watch the big is a show called the biggest loser no so yeah that's a way people that are

1134
01:38:51.80 --> 01:38:56.12
having weight problems they go on a show they get fed certain things made to work out and he lose a

1135
01:38:56.12 --> 01:39:00.44
bunch of weight and then they win the program and then when they go back home and they're not around that

1136
01:39:00.44 --> 01:39:06.20
imposed discipline right they lose it right that's my point yeah my point is that that impose discipline

1137
01:39:07.08 --> 01:39:15.96
it works you have the impos in closer they're watching you what I would prefer is to have someone that

1138
01:39:16.52 --> 01:39:23.08
makes out change in their mindset and develops self discipline right now sometimes you can get that

1139
01:39:23.08 --> 01:39:28.44
from impose discipline and you realize like you get shown the freedom that discipline gives you

1140
01:39:28.44 --> 01:39:33.24
and then you carry on with it like a lot of people that listen to the podcast and they've done

1141
01:39:33.24 --> 01:39:37.88
incredible things with their lives because we weren't there to impose discipline on them but they

1142
01:39:37.88 --> 01:39:41.64
recognize themselves maybe they said okay you know what I'm gonna get up for the next two weeks

1143
01:39:41.64 --> 01:39:46.52
and get up early I'm gonna work out I'm gonna eat healthy two weeks go by they've lost a little bit

1144
01:39:46.52 --> 01:39:51.88
of body fat they've gained a little bit of muscle and they feel good and all of a sudden they

1145
01:39:51.88 --> 01:39:56.36
realize the benefits of discipline and so they change their mindset and they become more discipline

1146
01:39:56.36 --> 01:40:02.04
human beings yeah that's what I like yeah when I don't like is it all run a boot camp on you

1147
01:40:02.04 --> 01:40:07.96
and yell at you and scream in person I think people want me to yell and scream I get that I think

1148
01:40:07.96 --> 01:40:12.52
once or twice a day someone will say you need to make an alarm clock where you yell and tell us to tell

1149
01:40:12.52 --> 01:40:16.92
me to get out of bed yeah and I say it gets psychological warfare but I'm not gonna yell in

1150
01:40:16.92 --> 01:40:23.88
psychological warfare because yelling isn't an effective tool compared to actually speaking to someone

1151
01:40:23.88 --> 01:40:28.52
and letting them understand why it's important yeah that's the preferred tool okay usually

1152
01:40:28.52 --> 01:40:32.76
do you got to yell at people occasionally yes you do occasionally not very often though yeah

1153
01:40:34.36 --> 01:40:39.96
but yeah yeah right now with that situational discipline because even I think about what's worse

1154
01:40:39.96 --> 01:40:46.28
somebody yelling at you or someone whispering at you it's actually worse isn't it?

1155
01:40:46.28 --> 01:40:52.28
somebody's in a lot of ways yeah to me it's worse sure yelling and screaming it doesn't

1156
01:40:52.28 --> 01:40:56.52
no and it really doesn't really matter what they're saying either if you choose yelling or

1157
01:40:56.52 --> 01:41:01.000
whispering because like you know even if they're telling you a normal thing like hey um here

1158
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.20
this is what I want from the store I want avocados tomatoes and you know some wine but what if I

1159
01:41:06.20 --> 01:41:13.24
whisper it to you hey joker thank you my fruit me out actually yeah yeah yeah so it didn't

1160
01:41:13.24 --> 01:41:17.56
sure about that example yeah except no no you get that that's the point it doesn't really matter

1161
01:41:17.56 --> 01:41:21.32
what they're saying whispering versus you oh yeah definitely has a different psychological

1162
01:41:21.32 --> 01:41:28.20
fact for sure that doesn't really freaks me out you be in a joker when you pick up a bottle of wine

1163
01:41:28.20 --> 01:41:35.96
you think no actually I can I'm leaving yeah the wine can it makes it extra awkward for sure

1164
01:41:37.08 --> 01:41:43.48
alright so now we get into another part on discipline right here and this is Sir John Furtiske

1165
01:41:44.60 --> 01:41:50.20
and what you pay attention to this one because we start going sideways I haven't my mind rather

1166
01:41:50.20 --> 01:41:57.56
those excellent but generally unthaking persons who shrink with horror from the idea of a man's

1167
01:41:57.56 --> 01:42:05.64
abdicating his civil rights what they say a man must obey even an unjust command under pain it

1168
01:42:05.64 --> 01:42:13.56
may be of death it is monstrous for purposes of civil life it might be monstrous but not for the

1169
01:42:13.56 --> 01:42:24.20
purposes in of implicit obedience which is the thing that matters in the army let there be justices

1170
01:42:24.20 --> 01:42:30.92
far as possible by all means but as a general principle it is better for an army that an in

1171
01:42:30.92 --> 01:42:37.88
justice should be done than that an order should be disobeyed this however is an argument that

1172
01:42:37.88 --> 01:42:47.96
cannot appeal to our imaginary objecter because he has read no military history so that's just

1173
01:42:47.96 --> 01:42:52.60
very disturbing this whole thing and it's really doesn't comply with anything that I say

1174
01:42:53.16 --> 01:42:57.16
which is I want you to question orders and if they're not good orders you shouldn't obey him

1175
01:42:57.16 --> 01:43:01.96
and he's saying no no no it's better to do something unjust as long as you're obeying orders

1176
01:43:01.96 --> 01:43:08.20
and I get a little bit of research about john for the skew and you know obviously I don't agree

1177
01:43:08.20 --> 01:43:14.84
with this and actually in the new version of the book the the guy that writes the forward to the

1178
01:43:14.84 --> 01:43:23.64
new version of this specifically calls out john for the skew and says we removed him he's

1179
01:43:23.64 --> 01:43:31.32
gone from the book and what I found out about him was yes he was in the army he was a major in the

1180
01:43:31.32 --> 01:43:38.60
army but I don't think he was in any combat and what I do know is that he was the royal librarian

1181
01:43:39.64 --> 01:43:47.72
from 1905 until 1926 and he died in 1902 so he didn't go to World War I really all these other

1182
01:43:47.72 --> 01:43:54.92
guys are World War I World War II veterans he was the the royal librarian and it's interesting

1183
01:43:54.92 --> 01:43:59.88
when he says because he has read no military he doesn't said because he's never been in combat before

1184
01:43:59.88 --> 01:44:03.56
he says he's read that cup the person that would object this is never read military history

1185
01:44:04.36 --> 01:44:09.56
well actually yeah he's going with a theory yeah he's going with a theory yeah and and if you want to

1186
01:44:09.56 --> 01:44:18.92
take this and stretch it out more broadly this attitude you know a hate World War I hate World War I

1187
01:44:18.92 --> 01:44:27.16
because it was so based on obedience and you are going to charge we're going to charge this

1188
01:44:27.16 --> 01:44:33.08
trench all 7,000 of us are going to charge tomorrow morning at 0630 where to go over the top

1189
01:44:33.08 --> 01:44:37.24
where to get mode down my machine guns and then then people are going to fall us and do the same thing

1190
01:44:37.24 --> 01:44:45.000
and that they the guys were so obedient and brave and just selfless to do that

1191
01:44:46.44 --> 01:44:53.88
but this attitude is what made that war so devastating because no one said hey wait a second

1192
01:44:53.88 --> 01:45:01.72
this doesn't seem smart to me I just watched you know a two three four battalions are two

1193
01:45:01.72 --> 01:45:08.20
three four regiments get mode down and now you're telling me I'm going to do the same thing tomorrow

1194
01:45:08.20 --> 01:45:16.60
with my men no I want you to question my orders I want you to say no if I'm making you do

1195
01:45:16.60 --> 01:45:22.36
something that doesn't make sense I want you to say no and if I can't explain it to you in a

1196
01:45:22.36 --> 01:45:33.08
logical way then I should rethink what I'm saying to you so Mr. John Fordiskew

1197
01:45:34.28 --> 01:45:39.24
we're going to have to say that we've kind of changed our opinion on on obedience and there are

1198
01:45:39.24 --> 01:45:44.68
more important things than obedience in a team in a military team and in the business world

1199
01:45:44.68 --> 01:45:55.48
here's another piece from the Sconeback General Williams slim any army without discipline is no

1200
01:45:55.48 --> 01:46:01.40
more than a mob alternating between frightened sheep and beasts of prey discipline as the British

1201
01:46:01.40 --> 01:46:08.44
soldiers demonstrated in peace and war is the old Christian virtue of unselfishness of standing by

1202
01:46:08.44 --> 01:46:16.44
your neighbor your comrade it is the sacrifice of a man's comfort inclination safety even life for others

1203
01:46:16.44 --> 01:46:24.44
for something greater than himself it is the refusal to be the weak link in the chain that snaps

1204
01:46:24.44 --> 01:46:32.12
under under strain then this is a great little story here one paragraph back to the book once

1205
01:46:32.12 --> 01:46:39.88
from the safety of a well dug command post I looked down on a battery vault artillery in action

1206
01:46:39.88 --> 01:46:50.76
in the African bush it was firing at five rounds per gun per minute and idly I timed the nearest gun

1207
01:46:51.88 --> 01:46:59.48
in that area the enemy unfortunately had complete local air supremacy and guns unless engaged in

1208
01:46:59.48 --> 01:47:05.000
some vital task were ordered to remain silent whenever hostile aircraft appeared

1209
01:47:06.60 --> 01:47:13.96
gradually dominating all other sounds came the dull drone of bombers flying low but the guns went

1210
01:47:13.96 --> 01:47:20.04
on firing five rounds per gun per minute for they were supporting an infantry attack

1211
01:47:21.56 --> 01:47:27.56
cover move by the way the first stick of bombs fell around the gun I was watching

1212
01:47:27.56 --> 01:47:38.44
some of its crew were hit the dry brush roared into flame which spread instantly to the camouflage

1213
01:47:38.44 --> 01:47:48.20
nets over the gun it vanished from my sight in smoke and flame yet from the very midst of that

1214
01:47:48.20 --> 01:47:58.52
inferno at the exact intervals came the flash and thud of the firing gun five rounds per minute

1215
01:47:59.24 --> 01:48:10.04
per gun never a falter never a second out no weak link there the discipline held

1216
01:48:10.04 --> 01:48:16.60
that's pretty awesome

1217
01:48:21.24 --> 01:48:28.36
sections here talking about duty and service and we're going to first start with Colonel George

1218
01:48:28.36 --> 01:48:40.92
Henderson a British officer who fought in Egypt and at the Battle of Kassassin and

1219
01:48:42.52 --> 01:48:48.04
he fought in the Boer Wars as well and he talks about waterloo here we go back to the book

1220
01:48:48.04 --> 01:48:54.44
no incidents more familiar in our military history than the stubborn resistance of the British

1221
01:48:54.44 --> 01:49:01.40
line at Waterloo through the long hours of the mid-summer day silent and immovable squares and

1222
01:49:01.40 --> 01:49:09.40
squadrons stood in the trampled corn harassed by an almost incestant fire of cannon and musketry

1223
01:49:09.40 --> 01:49:19.24
to which they were forbidden to make reply not a moment but heard some cry of agony not a moment

1224
01:49:19.24 --> 01:49:28.20
but some comrade fell headlong into the furrows yet as bullets of the skirmishers hailed around them

1225
01:49:29.24 --> 01:49:35.72
and the great shot tore through the tight packed ranks the word was passed quietly

1226
01:49:37.40 --> 01:49:45.24
closing on the center men and as the sun neared at setting the regiments still shoulder to shoulder

1227
01:49:45.24 --> 01:49:53.16
stood fast upon the ground they had held at noon the spectacle is characteristic

1228
01:49:54.20 --> 01:50:01.48
in good fortune and in ill it is rare indeed that a British regiment does not hold together

1229
01:50:02.44 --> 01:50:09.40
and this indestructible cohesion best of all qualities that an armed body can possess is based

1230
01:50:09.40 --> 01:50:18.12
not merely on hereditary resolution but on mutual confidence and mutual respect the man and the

1231
01:50:18.12 --> 01:50:26.52
ranks has implicit faith in his officer the officer and almost unbounded belief in the valor

1232
01:50:26.52 --> 01:50:38.68
and discipline of his men and that I've talked about this and people want to know what makes

1233
01:50:38.68 --> 01:50:45.32
the seal teams do well the thing that makes the seal teams do well is the bond that holds

1234
01:50:45.32 --> 01:50:54.28
them together and that bond is so strong that it's unbreakable and that's why seals do well in combat

1235
01:50:55.08 --> 01:50:59.64
because we have a bond that is unbreakable stronger than anything that's going to get thrown at us

1236
01:51:00.28 --> 01:51:02.84
the brotherhood is going to stand

1237
01:51:02.84 --> 01:51:12.52
and I'm going to close this book out with two more quotes and speaking of water

1238
01:51:12.52 --> 01:51:22.52
this one is from Wellington and this is a very simple quote he said my rule was always to do

1239
01:51:22.52 --> 01:51:31.64
the business of the day in the day and I I was reading this book the other day and I actually

1240
01:51:31.64 --> 01:51:38.04
posted something about it but I I I didn't realize I was thinking about this but we have a

1241
01:51:38.04 --> 01:51:43.32
of saying in the seal teams plan your dive and dive your plan is this thing so when you're

1242
01:51:43.32 --> 01:51:48.28
when you're doing a combat swimmer attack which is when you're on a re-breather and you're diving

1243
01:51:48.28 --> 01:51:54.28
underwater and when if you've never dove before if you don't understand this it's very hard to

1244
01:51:54.28 --> 01:51:59.72
comprehend what combat swimmer is like but I'll give you a real quick brief when you're doing a

1245
01:51:59.72 --> 01:52:07.80
combat dive on a re-breather you basically can't see anything it's nighttime you're down at

1246
01:52:08.92 --> 01:52:16.76
10 12 15 feet underwater it's black you can't see anything there's no like fish swimming around

1247
01:52:16.76 --> 01:52:21.56
there's no sea life to look at there's no coral reef it's black you can't see anything

1248
01:52:21.56 --> 01:52:28.20
the only thing you can actually see is something called an attack board which an attack board

1249
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:34.04
sounds really cool but let me tell you what it is it's a piece of plastic used to be wood

1250
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:45.88
that has on it a depth gauge a compass and a watch to time and so you put little tiny

1251
01:52:45.88 --> 01:52:50.20
chemlights little glowing chemlights and you actually tape them up so that they're barely

1252
01:52:50.20 --> 01:52:56.92
emitting any light at all and you put one by the stopwatch one by the compass and one by the depth

1253
01:52:56.92 --> 01:53:03.000
gauge and when you're underwater so you have those things they're basically strapped onto this board

1254
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.56
that you hold I don't know it's like like the about the size of a piece of paper right

1255
01:53:07.56 --> 01:53:10.76
of eight and a half by 11 piece paper that's about how big this board is and on it you've got

1256
01:53:10.76 --> 01:53:16.04
your depth gauge your compass and your stopwatch and you can barely see them they're glowing very

1257
01:53:16.04 --> 01:53:23.16
faintly and when you're underwater that's all you can see it is just that you can't see anything

1258
01:53:23.16 --> 01:53:29.96
else occasionally you'll get like some weird abstract light from the moon or something but

1259
01:53:29.96 --> 01:53:35.72
even that to rare because you're down underwater and if you've ever been in water with low visibility

1260
01:53:35.72 --> 01:53:40.04
sometimes that sometimes it's actually hard to see the attack board that's too feet in front

1261
01:53:40.04 --> 01:53:45.56
of your face so then what you're doing is you're looking at that compass you're looking at that

1262
01:53:45.56 --> 01:53:52.20
depth gauge and you're looking at the stopwatch and you have pre-planned legs that you're going on

1263
01:53:52.20 --> 01:53:58.68
you're going to go this long this this bearing this long this depth for this time and when I say

1264
01:53:58.68 --> 01:54:05.000
it's so you're kicking looking at this board for an hour and 17 minutes then you're going to make

1265
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.44
a 90 degree turn and you're going to go for another 48 minutes and then you're going to make a

1266
01:54:10.44 --> 01:54:14.68
right turn for 12 minutes and you're going to hit your target then you're going to turn around

1267
01:54:14.68 --> 01:54:19.16
do some other route back out as long as you can stay underwater you stand a water that eventually

1268
01:54:19.16 --> 01:54:23.48
run out of oxygen you come to the surface and you swim the rest of the way to your extract

1269
01:54:25.56 --> 01:54:33.40
any visions of the glory and the the fun of being a seal this is it's not it's work

1270
01:54:34.36 --> 01:54:39.64
and it's hard work and you have to concentrate the whole time and you got to make sure you don't go to

1271
01:54:40.76 --> 01:54:45.72
shallow or too deep if you go too shallow you'll be seeing if you go to deep your go off the

1272
01:54:45.72 --> 01:54:51.000
dive tables that you're allowed to be on oxygen for so you got to focus the whole time and by the

1273
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.76
way you're in a spare and your buddy that's with you he's even more miserable than you are because

1274
01:54:56.76 --> 01:55:00.84
he has no idea what's going on he's just trying to keep up with you because for some reason the

1275
01:55:00.84 --> 01:55:05.16
way you dive the way you put your body when you have the attack board you can swim a little bit

1276
01:55:05.16 --> 01:55:08.28
faster than the guy that's looking around and making sure that you're not going to hit anything

1277
01:55:08.28 --> 01:55:13.16
and make sure not so there's only one attack board there there's a one attack board for

1278
01:55:13.16 --> 01:55:18.20
it prepare okay sometimes we would make to make a smaller attack board just because it was

1279
01:55:18.20 --> 01:55:24.20
so much more efficient to fly with them but you can't fly if you're the buddy you can't be

1280
01:55:24.20 --> 01:55:27.88
just looking at the attack board you have to look around attack board the attack board you can't

1281
01:55:27.88 --> 01:55:34.52
that's what we call the attack board so with all that the reason I'm telling you all this is that

1282
01:55:34.52 --> 01:55:40.20
when you're underwater it's really easy to get confused and turned around and sometimes you go

1283
01:55:40.20 --> 01:55:44.76
over big pieces of metal that are in the water and your compass starts to like wander around

1284
01:55:45.56 --> 01:55:51.24
and you can't communicate with your buddy man that's what it sounds like you've got so

1285
01:55:51.24 --> 01:55:57.48
we know we have squeeze signals and sometimes we carry grease pens to write but it's never there's

1286
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:04.44
no real effective way to communicate underwater so you're just in this dark just cold

1287
01:56:04.44 --> 01:56:15.48
blind situation for three two three four hours at a time and the saying is that we have

1288
01:56:16.20 --> 01:56:21.96
is plan your dive and dive your plan because if you and I go underwater and then we start trying to

1289
01:56:21.96 --> 01:56:25.80
adjust things while we're underwater and we just we think we're going to do something different once

1290
01:56:25.80 --> 01:56:29.000
we go first of all you and I're going to be thinking two different things and it's going to be a disaster

1291
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:37.64
so we plan our dive and dive our plan and that's reminded me of this statement do the business of

1292
01:56:37.64 --> 01:56:44.20
the day in the day right get done what you say you're going to get done do it and how simple is that

1293
01:56:44.76 --> 01:56:50.60
and it's like dive your plan and what I said the other day I said plan what you're going to do

1294
01:56:50.60 --> 01:56:56.84
and then do what you plan that's real simple and and I think about how far you're going to

1295
01:56:56.84 --> 01:57:02.28
think of where you will be in two weeks if every day you plan what you're going to do and then you do

1296
01:57:02.28 --> 01:57:10.44
what you plan it's amazing yeah it seems to say that that's what we're talking about a few weeks ago

1297
01:57:10.44 --> 01:57:16.76
where it's like distractions that's the thing you know I've seen there's like just industries of

1298
01:57:16.76 --> 01:57:21.32
distractions yeah for sure you never wake up I was explaining to my eight-year-old daughter of the

1299
01:57:21.32 --> 01:57:27.96
other day that they designed because she was playing a game on iPad and I said oh what are you learning

1300
01:57:27.96 --> 01:57:33.000
from that and she said oh what do you mean I said oh are you learning anything from that

1301
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:38.36
and she said well you have to get these rings and I said oh so you're not learning anything from that

1302
01:57:39.40 --> 01:57:44.92
and she said I don't I said you know what they do they make that game to make you want to play it more

1303
01:57:44.92 --> 01:57:49.000
or there's no there's no end to the game to play the way they just want you to play that

1304
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.04
game keep clicking on that that's yeah there look you know of course I'm just being a total jerk I'm

1305
01:57:54.04 --> 01:58:01.16
like yeah look at how it works look at you look at you you look at you you look at you holding on to

1306
01:58:01.16 --> 01:58:05.16
this thing and she doesn't fall for this anymore when she was younger I used to go up and

1307
01:58:05.16 --> 01:58:10.36
and press her head as if her head was getting softer and I look at her like oh man how long

1308
01:58:10.36 --> 01:58:16.20
have you been on this for you said I don't know and it's a I think if you stop now your brain might

1309
01:58:16.20 --> 01:58:22.12
harden back up eventually do the same thing with her muscles like you're eating like chips or

1310
01:58:22.12 --> 01:58:27.80
some way too many chips like you're muscle getting like all soft right now yeah she's young

1311
01:58:27.80 --> 01:58:34.68
just for so it works but they do they plan these things so they addicted yeah

1312
01:58:34.68 --> 01:58:39.56
addicted those iPad ones there's no and well everything is designed right right now you

1313
01:58:39.56 --> 01:58:43.80
you talk about the Facebook app that shows the little thing that shows oh yeah like yeah

1314
01:58:43.80 --> 01:58:48.68
you're gonna mess it up and this might be the message that I've been waiting for right variable

1315
01:58:48.68 --> 01:58:53.56
reward it might not be so that's the thing that's if you know guaranteed it what it's going to

1316
01:58:53.56 --> 01:58:57.56
be consistently it's less addictive it's called variable reward yeah that's what I'm saying but

1317
01:58:57.56 --> 01:59:01.96
you the everyone in their mind is thinking this might be yeah this might be the big one exactly I'm

1318
01:59:01.96 --> 01:59:08.76
getting contacted by by tenacious D they saw my tweet they're getting back at me they're going to

1319
01:59:08.76 --> 01:59:15.88
come on the podcast we're attending it's today's the jack black and Kyle gas no it's a movie it's a band

1320
01:59:17.72 --> 01:59:23.08
from a movie they have been in a movie yes and they have a jack black jack black

1321
01:59:23.08 --> 01:59:30.44
actor no that's a black and not a new musician okay got you school of rock that's a great show

1322
01:59:30.44 --> 01:59:35.56
hell that's not a movie that's jack black no no he isn't active like I said in a

1323
01:59:35.56 --> 01:59:42.44
talk to be here remember who got so why do we just talk about oh yeah because I think in

1324
01:59:42.44 --> 01:59:48.12
all this might be the tweet that I was waiting for from tenacious D sure so I got to check my

1325
01:59:48.12 --> 01:59:55.000
twitter 47 times a minute yeah no not happening you can you get you don't have a tweet from

1326
01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.68
tenacious D that's not there they didn't tweet you yeah so don't check your twitter going do

1327
02:00:00.68 --> 02:00:10.04
something productive yeah but so and that's when you're already distracted so basically the

1328
02:00:10.04 --> 02:00:17.000
point was you know do your plan your day or do you know and do the plan right so because no one

1329
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:24.60
plan your day and do what you plan yeah that's it so you know and plans to what's really jacked up

1330
02:00:24.60 --> 02:00:31.80
is if you actually took what you did in a day and you wrote it down and planned it I bet you could

1331
02:00:31.80 --> 02:00:36.68
get it done in so much less time like right now I've got a lot of stuff going on right now

1332
02:00:37.08 --> 02:00:44.68
and I'm doing things that normally take me two hours I'm doing in 46 minutes same quality by the way

1333
02:00:44.68 --> 02:00:49.88
did it's getting after it right but you got to put a little suspense date on something and say

1334
02:00:49.88 --> 02:00:54.76
let's do here you got to get it done and then you just sit down and make it happen yeah that's

1335
02:00:54.76 --> 02:01:00.44
what you need to do oh it's it's one of those simple but I need these easy things but this is why

1336
02:01:00.44 --> 02:01:06.60
so you would you put in a way you put these kind of parameters on what you're gonna do and if like

1337
02:01:06.60 --> 02:01:10.92
I if okay I'm making a plan and I'm sticking to the plan right that's what I'm doing so I plan to

1338
02:01:10.92 --> 02:01:15.96
do XYZX you know all these things yep and if so basically right when you say okay here's the

1339
02:01:15.96 --> 02:01:23.72
plan you outline it if it's not in the plan you just don't do it it's so yeah so distractions no

1340
02:01:23.72 --> 02:01:30.28
one plans like hey tomorrow I'm gonna just eat like crap tomorrow that's the plan that's never the plan

1341
02:01:30.28 --> 02:01:34.68
you know but if you don't have any plan or nothing sure you allow those things to come in so

1342
02:01:34.68 --> 02:01:38.52
if you're like okay tomorrow and you're not gonna plan the whole day you're not gonna plan every

1343
02:01:38.52 --> 02:01:45.32
meal you're not gonna if you did you'd be real effective yeah if you stay on locked right

1344
02:01:45.32 --> 02:01:49.40
so if you get the meal prep the night before like when you go through those phases where you're

1345
02:01:49.40 --> 02:01:53.64
cooking seven chicken breasts and you're just red you got everything laid out one day too so yeah

1346
02:01:53.64 --> 02:01:58.68
well there you go yeah really people do that yeah for those degrees and it works yes sir yeah

1347
02:01:58.68 --> 02:02:03.96
exactly right so and isn't realistic and really when you think about it kind of is if you're committed

1348
02:02:03.96 --> 02:02:09.48
to it well what's crazy is is it takes more work upfront how long does it take to prepare all your

1349
02:02:09.48 --> 02:02:14.28
meals for the week and by the way I don't do this yeah but how long I've done it before how long

1350
02:02:14.28 --> 02:02:19.40
to take prepare with meals it takes you two hours two hours and 20 minutes let's say

1351
02:02:19.96 --> 02:02:24.52
amount of time by the way you get done preparing those and you save time in the week right

1352
02:02:24.52 --> 02:02:29.88
because now you're not sitting around just redepointing your pots and pans redepointing your stove

1353
02:02:29.88 --> 02:02:36.60
setting that to all that other stuff you actually are gonna save time if you plan your day

1354
02:02:36.60 --> 02:02:44.76
yeah and then you do your plan yeah and think about just if you use that meal prep example where okay you

1355
02:02:44.76 --> 02:02:49.88
don't typically we don't plan our every meal for a week typically just don't do that but when you do

1356
02:02:49.88 --> 02:02:54.84
the meal prep planning situation you're saying we meaning human beings in general where everybody

1357
02:02:54.84 --> 02:03:01.40
yeah that typical person so that's a good example so when you do that now boom that your meals

1358
02:03:01.40 --> 02:03:08.04
an element of your life that typically isn't quote unquote planned is now planned so now those

1359
02:03:08.04 --> 02:03:12.12
parameters are set so anything outside of those parameters do you just don't really think about

1360
02:03:12.12 --> 02:03:16.68
as much you know and one they kind of enter you it's real obvious like hey that's not part of this

1361
02:03:16.68 --> 02:03:20.68
plan what the hell you know it's like it's more of a life but if you don't plan it they come in it's kind

1362
02:03:20.68 --> 02:03:25.24
like whatever there's no parameters there anyway in my head so that goes for everything you do so just

1363
02:03:25.24 --> 02:03:29.16
like how you're saying yeah have a lot of stuff so you plan okay I'm gonna do this here do this now

1364
02:03:29.16 --> 02:03:33.48
do this at this time finish it by this time all this stuff those parameters are set so the

1365
02:03:33.48 --> 02:03:39.08
distractions have a way harder time to get in so in everyday life you can make some ambiguous goal hey I

1366
02:03:39.08 --> 02:03:44.28
want to eat better no plan by the way just it's an ambiguous goal there's no parameters on there

1367
02:03:44.28 --> 02:03:51.40
so you take one missed step you you know you were at the stop light for longer than you expected

1368
02:03:51.40 --> 02:03:55.80
now you're late for this now I'm pressed for a time there's the McDonald's right and it it'll just

1369
02:03:55.80 --> 02:03:59.32
sneak right in but if you got those parameters then you'll be able to make Donald's nope

1370
02:03:59.32 --> 02:04:03.64
not part of my plan right now yeah my plan I got to you know I got to execute yeah and another thing

1371
02:04:03.64 --> 02:04:12.12
I if you're gonna plan your day you should actually plan to have time in there that has nothing

1372
02:04:12.12 --> 02:04:17.16
in it right so you should you should plan to have a half an hour where you're you're gonna

1373
02:04:17.16 --> 02:04:21.72
address problems right okay so that way of problems because they're gonna come up

1374
02:04:21.72 --> 02:04:28.92
yeah you gotta you gotta have your your free time and by free I mean free to go make other things

1375
02:04:28.92 --> 02:04:34.12
happen and just and make things good but what you shouldn't do is say because I'll tell you there's

1376
02:04:34.12 --> 02:04:39.56
some things that I have a really hard time like with the podcast I'll keep preparing the podcast

1377
02:04:39.56 --> 02:04:45.96
I'll just go I'm just feeling the time I know I go beyond that because there's another story

1378
02:04:45.96 --> 02:04:48.92
that ties into something else and I'm gonna go pull out another book and by the way I got

1379
02:04:48.92 --> 02:04:52.84
to run the out of time to get it from Amazon so I'm gonna go to the library you know what I mean

1380
02:04:52.84 --> 02:04:58.84
it's just you go down where I could prepare for a podcast forever and not be ready for it and so

1381
02:04:58.84 --> 02:05:04.84
I have to put myself in check and say okay draw the line on this level of depth on this thing

1382
02:05:04.84 --> 02:05:11.08
now I might make a footnote and I've got a cool category now on my computer that's you know

1383
02:05:11.08 --> 02:05:16.60
tangents where I what I opened a tangent and I didn't close it on the podcast so now we're gonna

1384
02:05:16.60 --> 02:05:22.44
be able to enter them at a different time when when time allows because I can get focused on that

1385
02:05:22.44 --> 02:05:29.64
one subject so that's pretty cool yeah but it takes discipline to do that because otherwise I would

1386
02:05:29.64 --> 02:05:33.48
just go down every rabbit I could open up and you take a book like this and there's so many

1387
02:05:33.48 --> 02:05:38.68
rabbit holes in there it's almost impossible to stay out of them it gets kind of ridiculous

1388
02:05:38.68 --> 02:05:47.96
yeah in a way so my point is playing playing your day and then execute your plan if you do

1389
02:05:47.96 --> 02:05:53.88
that it's gonna make a huge difference in your life and let's go look up you look up and

1390
02:05:55.56 --> 02:06:01.40
a month two months three months the amount of stuff that you've gotten done is ridiculous

1391
02:06:02.28 --> 02:06:07.64
and I'll tell you one of the ways that I do do that myself as I just pass myself with that I

1392
02:06:07.64 --> 02:06:13.48
would say I'm gonna do things and you have to have to do them yeah they are. If let's say with this

1393
02:06:13.48 --> 02:06:19.000
podcast good example we do this podcast once a week we've held the line really well on that

1394
02:06:19.88 --> 02:06:27.08
if we didn't if we said you know what let's just put the podcast out when we put it out right

1395
02:06:27.08 --> 02:06:33.48
if that was the mindset we had from the beginning we would probably I'm gonna guess that we would

1396
02:06:33.48 --> 02:06:38.92
have less than half of the podcasts would have been put out that's my guess because we were to

1397
02:06:38.92 --> 02:06:43.72
said you know what hey I got a train this week and I'm gonna miss that and I haven't read the

1398
02:06:43.72 --> 02:06:50.52
book that I was gonna read so because right now bro oh I've got 15 minutes that little half hour

1399
02:06:50.52 --> 02:06:54.44
of my schedule or I have nothing guess what I'm doing in that half hour I'm doing 22 minutes worth

1400
02:06:54.44 --> 02:06:59.72
of reading of a book that's coming up yeah that's what I'm doing if we didn't have the

1401
02:06:59.72 --> 02:07:05.40
discipline structure in place that probably wouldn't be happening yeah that probably wouldn't be

1402
02:07:05.40 --> 02:07:09.88
we'd be going oh you know what little time with bi-Hey bro yeah let's let's let's let's give this

1403
02:07:09.88 --> 02:07:14.76
week a visit so much easier yeah yeah you know what I was gonna go going hang out today and

1404
02:07:14.76 --> 02:07:20.84
only want to do this today no we're doing it yeah we we signed up for it yep totally now

1405
02:07:20.84 --> 02:07:24.92
could it get to a point where said you know what every two weeks we've mentioned that before

1406
02:07:24.92 --> 02:07:35.56
people didn't like that idea yeah you know why because I like that discipline yeah why would

1407
02:07:35.56 --> 02:07:40.60
you know why because I'm basically I'm basically confining myself that doing something productive

1408
02:07:40.60 --> 02:07:46.52
as opposed to watching YouTube videos right about cats because there's some good YouTube videos

1409
02:07:47.24 --> 02:07:54.04
right there's some good YouTube videos but there's also a lot of them are not good

1410
02:07:54.04 --> 02:07:58.92
and you're not getting anything out of them yeah and man the ones that they rack up for you

1411
02:07:59.64 --> 02:08:05.72
when you've just got done watching one yeah the ones that they rack up for you or every single one

1412
02:08:05.72 --> 02:08:09.08
of them what do they rack up I think they rack up for on top and for on bottom when you're

1413
02:08:09.08 --> 02:08:14.76
little screen yeah and every one of them is like a clickbait right every one of them is a clickbait

1414
02:08:14.76 --> 02:08:22.52
it's crazy yeah it's they do that obviously yeah because it it has a lot to do with

1415
02:08:22.52 --> 02:08:28.20
everything that you've you've won for sure so yeah it's gonna be it's the next video is always

1416
02:08:28.20 --> 02:08:34.60
just like it's a 90% relevant to what you specifically want right there and that is why

1417
02:08:34.60 --> 02:08:39.32
that is why you got to get angry at though you know you know if you have that uh you know how you

1418
02:08:39.32 --> 02:08:46.36
have that that way that you ever came your anger management right by but you read that it was like

1419
02:08:46.36 --> 02:08:51.24
you you had low self esteem that's why you're getting mad well when you get that when you get

1420
02:08:51.24 --> 02:08:57.48
that next rack of YouTube videos staring at you you should be getting pissed because you know what they're

1421
02:08:57.48 --> 02:09:02.52
trying to do you're trying to get you to try to take your time away from you yeah and by the way

1422
02:09:02.52 --> 02:09:06.36
they're making money from you you click that next thing you they're making their making money from

1423
02:09:06.36 --> 02:09:11.16
what you're doing and so they've they've set this system up to make you click that thing yeah

1424
02:09:11.16 --> 02:09:15.96
so you're a mark is what you know you're a mark you're a marker look at you falling for it

1425
02:09:15.96 --> 02:09:21.32
everything you have yeah that's how I click drinking too by the way that is legit like oh I'm falling

1426
02:09:21.32 --> 02:09:26.68
for a trick that my brain is playing on me I'm falling for that trick I'm falling for that trick

1427
02:09:26.68 --> 02:09:33.40
that and like I said it's hard too because it's mixed in with positive stuff on YouTube there's

1428
02:09:33.40 --> 02:09:39.08
a really good quality stuff on YouTube there's some great knowledge you can gain from YouTube for sure

1429
02:09:39.08 --> 02:09:44.60
and if you're good at justifying things yeah yeah that's true too it's a really scary but my point

1430
02:09:44.60 --> 02:09:50.52
is I don't want to sit here and bag on YouTube because it's an incredible source of information

1431
02:09:51.32 --> 02:09:57.24
if you keep it informational but it's real easy to get sideways on that and they somehow know

1432
02:09:58.12 --> 02:10:03.96
they can attach like watching a street fight too because I watch street fights or I watch a

1433
02:10:04.68 --> 02:10:09.64
you know a UFC fighter I'll watch a clip or I'll watch a submission they know how to drag you in

1434
02:10:09.64 --> 02:10:18.04
to like those clickbait titles of the guy fighting in the kangaroo yeah man versus kangaroo

1435
02:10:18.04 --> 02:10:23.08
unbelievable right and of course you're thinking yourself okay well what would I do if I

1436
02:10:23.08 --> 02:10:27.08
did fight a kangaroo yeah I live in America and I'm not fighting in the kangaroo but somehow I

1437
02:10:27.08 --> 02:10:34.44
got to click on that video you see what else such garbage so good job YouTube and I'm not going to be

1438
02:10:34.44 --> 02:10:39.96
a soccer over here no don't be alarmed give yourself a limit yeah seeing and that goes back to

1439
02:10:39.96 --> 02:10:46.04
give yourself like a click limit on those things yeah or just set your plan right give yourself

1440
02:10:46.04 --> 02:10:52.20
those parameters but you won't it's it even me thinking about it right now it really after you

1441
02:10:52.20 --> 02:10:57.16
can explain to there it really puts it into perspective and all the things you ever I mean you're

1442
02:10:57.16 --> 02:11:02.52
different than I think I think a lot of people where sometimes people only make plans if like

1443
02:11:02.52 --> 02:11:07.08
they have important stuff something that's important I got work stuff right I got this to do

1444
02:11:07.08 --> 02:11:11.32
this there's like 10 things on the list which actually seems like a pretty big to do this if you think

1445
02:11:11.32 --> 02:11:20.68
10 in one day you know how many things you do in a day that you can get distracted from a lot of them yeah

1446
02:11:20.68 --> 02:11:25.88
more than 10 it's like a lot and that goes everything everything from like the sweat the day you wake

1447
02:11:25.88 --> 02:11:31.16
up or not the day but the time you wake up what you eat every single time by the way

1448
02:11:31.16 --> 02:11:39.16
oh the TV watcher don't watch I get every second of the day if it had a parameter on it

1449
02:11:39.16 --> 02:11:44.84
and you'd be just laser focus on all your goals instead of these ambiguous who or what

1450
02:11:44.84 --> 02:11:50.92
yeah lose weight or I want to I need to I don't know XYZ more yeah and I'll tell you

1451
02:11:50.92 --> 02:11:56.60
nothing the plan doesn't take that much time to put together yeah and how you say it's it'll

1452
02:11:56.60 --> 02:12:01.08
end up saving you time oh for sure it'll end up in one way another 10 minutes that you spend

1453
02:12:01.08 --> 02:12:07.16
planning the next day we'll save you four hours yeah you can usually get done everything you have to

1454
02:12:07.16 --> 02:12:12.52
get done in like half the time yeah half the time it's crazy and it's weird too because I don't

1455
02:12:12.52 --> 02:12:15.96
I mean there's a busy people out there I don't want to make it sound like there's some

1456
02:12:15.96 --> 02:12:22.60
some people that are really busy yeah but I get the single mom she's got two three kids

1457
02:12:22.60 --> 02:12:27.40
she's got two three jobs yeah she doesn't you know what she's listening this conversation going

1458
02:12:27.40 --> 02:12:32.76
yeah no kid yeah no kid she even wants youtube yeah she's in the game 24 seven yeah well

1459
02:12:32.76 --> 02:12:38.36
not she's in the game 20 because she's worth she's sleeping for her right 20 yeah she's keeping it

1460
02:12:38.36 --> 02:12:44.44
together yeah and when you say there's busy yeah there are two things to that yeah there are busy

1461
02:12:44.44 --> 02:12:48.92
people you know that's how those people get those like the single moms or the single dads

1462
02:12:49.72 --> 02:12:56.20
they get the kind of what I just said they are in a situation they have no choice in it

1463
02:12:56.20 --> 02:12:59.48
right after yeah that's not no choice they get after they're like all I'm going to get this

1464
02:12:59.48 --> 02:13:03.40
done they got to their friend they're looking at their kid they're looking at their three-year-old

1465
02:13:03.40 --> 02:13:10.68
kid that that three-year-old kid has nothing without that mom getting on the grind and going to

1466
02:13:10.68 --> 02:13:18.60
the restaurant yeah and working as a waitress or whatever or she's working her job whatever she's

1467
02:13:18.60 --> 02:13:24.28
doing yeah just putting it together no is exactly Tuesday three weeks from now I'm at four

1468
02:13:24.28 --> 02:13:29.80
forty six she knows where she's gonna be yeah she knows exactly where yeah I mean I don't

1469
02:13:29.80 --> 02:13:34.12
come on you know compared to the average person we don't know and then

1470
02:13:34.12 --> 02:13:37.88
compared to the average where you definitely know but you're not even like a hundred percent

1471
02:13:37.88 --> 02:13:43.08
sure which I've been doing in an hour because you know cruising could interlude at any time

1472
02:13:43.08 --> 02:13:48.76
and could might just be cruising is a very ambiguous activity but then go to the other side of

1473
02:13:48.76 --> 02:13:53.96
the spectrum of busy people I mean they're busy because they don't plan you know that's

1474
02:13:53.96 --> 02:13:59.72
definitely true and yeah I'm so busy all the time meanwhile no no productivity yeah or

1475
02:13:59.72 --> 02:14:07.80
or very little limited limited true plan your day execute you plan all right last

1476
02:14:09.64 --> 02:14:21.56
little quote from this this is Frederick the Great the Battle of Colin in 1757 and there were some

1477
02:14:21.56 --> 02:14:26.20
troops that were a red a couple different versions again speaking of rabbit holes or

1478
02:14:26.20 --> 02:14:29.72
start going down these rabbit holes I read two different versions of this there was either

1479
02:14:29.72 --> 02:14:36.12
troops that were hesitating to attack or there were troops that were actually retreating

1480
02:14:36.68 --> 02:14:43.32
and to these troops Frederick the Great said dogs would you live forever

1481
02:14:43.32 --> 02:14:51.64
and another way that was translated was you cursive rascals would you live forever

1482
02:14:53.48 --> 02:14:57.80
and was he saying this to you saying that to his own troops right okay that are

1483
02:14:58.92 --> 02:15:03.96
leaving either either hesitating to attack or they're or they're retreating and he said dogs

1484
02:15:04.68 --> 02:15:11.24
yeah kind of barbarians yeah no what would you live forever no is that what you're looking for

1485
02:15:11.24 --> 02:15:19.96
to live forever yeah no you shouldn't be and you know I I think that's a good way to wrap up

1486
02:15:19.96 --> 02:15:28.68
that book because like we said those two quotes always do the business of the day in the day

1487
02:15:28.68 --> 02:15:42.60
so plan what you do and do what you plan and dogs you cursive rascals would you live forever

1488
02:15:42.60 --> 02:15:51.80
let me answer that for you know you won't and we're here talking about a book we talk about a

1489
02:15:51.80 --> 02:15:56.36
book today and we talk about leadership and that's awesome but you got to start by leading

1490
02:15:56.36 --> 02:16:06.44
yourself by doing what you say you will do that's integrity personal integrity when you say

1491
02:16:06.44 --> 02:16:10.44
that you're going to do something that they talked about being straight today it's talking

1492
02:16:10.44 --> 02:16:18.28
about personal integrity that starts with yourself by doing what you actually say you are going to

1493
02:16:18.28 --> 02:16:33.32
do by not hesitating and waiting got to lead yourself so get moving don't wait do what you plan

1494
02:16:33.32 --> 02:16:52.76
and do it today because you don't get to live forever and the clock is ticking and I think that's

1495
02:16:52.76 --> 02:16:59.72
all I've got for tonight and echo since we are not hesitating right now if you could without

1496
02:16:59.72 --> 02:17:11.40
hesitation please explain to people how they might be able to support this podcast if they want to

1497
02:17:11.40 --> 02:17:20.12
sure of course because we don't want to live forever actually Conan the Barbarian didn't say that

1498
02:17:20.12 --> 02:17:25.72
he didn't say he didn't say much in Conan the Barbarian that's a few lines but not that much

1499
02:17:25.72 --> 02:17:34.84
his girlfriend girl that ends up being his girlfriend then she dies later but whatever oh she says

1500
02:17:38.44 --> 02:17:43.000
when they hesitated or when they're about to do something nuts she says do you want to live forever

1501
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.84
than they just charge okay well there you go she thinks exactly yeah that's the exact usage

1502
02:17:48.84 --> 02:17:56.76
anyway speaking of not hesitating so kettlebells I'm talking about on it but this is kind of

1503
02:17:56.76 --> 02:18:04.28
this relevant reminded me I kind of meant to it earlier before I started recording so I hear good

1504
02:18:04.28 --> 02:18:10.04
things right kettlebells and I'm a little familiar I'll incorporate them here and there but

1505
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.56
you know I just hear more and more so I'm like hey I'm gonna make this a big part of the

1506
02:18:15.56 --> 02:18:26.44
you know the routine the program yeah you do kettlebells obviously yes how much dumbbell stuff

1507
02:18:26.44 --> 02:18:31.08
do you like dumbbell I actually don't use a lot of dumbbells and there you have a big dumbbell guy

1508
02:18:31.08 --> 02:18:37.08
yeah like even like bench right yeah I don't know man how well is that some like bench like

1509
02:18:37.08 --> 02:18:42.28
people will say hey how much can you bench yeah I don't know man not enough that's my answer

1510
02:18:42.28 --> 02:18:48.36
so long time well you know I back to the kettlebell so starting kettlebells

1511
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.08
but I got and you know you learn the tip be careful with kettlebells if you're doing the kettlebells

1512
02:18:56.20 --> 02:19:00.60
yeah you know how they see yeah start off light this I'd say with kettlebells more so

1513
02:19:00.60 --> 02:19:05.16
than you because when you throw a kettle that thing it's not like a dumbbell is like you grab a

1514
02:19:05.16 --> 02:19:10.68
dumbbell it has a perfect handle each side of the dumbbells perfectly balanced the same exact

1515
02:19:10.68 --> 02:19:14.68
with but kettlebell has a handle then it's on the thing it'll flip around it'll break your

1516
02:19:14.68 --> 02:19:18.44
loop right you can break your hand or when you're swinging them you know the one that you go

1517
02:19:18.44 --> 02:19:22.92
I don't know all the terms sorry but the one you grab it with the two hands it's not swing yeah

1518
02:19:22.92 --> 02:19:27.96
kettlebell the basic one yeah you know the boss wait between your legs yep but I'm like swinging

1519
02:19:27.96 --> 02:19:33.000
it and I'm like oh what if this what if my balance was off or I don't know whatever and the kettlebell

1520
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.80
hit my chin you being a lot of pain bro it can break your chin if you have your chin you know even

1521
02:19:37.80 --> 02:19:45.64
if you had like a 62 pound kettlebell in break your chin be careful with that anyway so to make things

1522
02:19:46.84 --> 02:19:52.20
actually technically they're not what I got the on it ones the the wear wolf you know and the

1523
02:19:52.20 --> 02:19:57.48
champion of that and you think when you compare them to the regular kettlebells um they're the

1524
02:19:57.48 --> 02:20:02.84
kettlebells around right the regular ones so you think oh you know the design and ones with the

1525
02:20:02.84 --> 02:20:07.48
wear wolf they might be kind of awkward because they're not like perfectly uniform but guess what

1526
02:20:08.68 --> 02:20:13.16
the balance when they make them yeah so they're just as safe but

1527
02:20:14.20 --> 02:20:23.56
so we're gonna be careful this I'm I'm explaining the new emergence of kettlebells in my work out yeah

1528
02:20:24.44 --> 02:20:29.16
and you like them I like them a lot and the point is don't hesitate right because you know how you

1529
02:20:29.16 --> 02:20:35.000
need to do more kettlebells and big and big U.S. goal that's what it is no parameters

1530
02:20:35.88 --> 02:20:39.80
but I was like you know what today's the day I'm gonna do I'm gonna this is gonna be the workout

1531
02:20:39.80 --> 02:20:44.12
this is so my workout was you know you want numbers I'll keep you numbers so what I did

1532
02:20:46.12 --> 02:20:52.68
met con kettlebells the wear wolf so those are 62 pounds each and two the double boom so

1533
02:20:53.48 --> 02:20:58.36
it's like a D I don't know if this is an actual kettlebell official movement I think it is

1534
02:20:58.36 --> 02:21:04.36
you go it's like a kettlebell swing two of them outside of the hips narrow stance up to

1535
02:21:05.08 --> 02:21:09.80
clean okay you clean it right and then press it right and then back down press

1536
02:21:09.80 --> 02:21:16.84
squat boom boom okay and press yes so I do five reps and then five burpees

1537
02:21:17.80 --> 02:21:25.56
walk in a circle 35 second yeah five reps again so I do that six times

1538
02:21:25.56 --> 02:21:31.24
to click I don't know eight minutes eight and that was a mess I was the same as my other

1539
02:21:31.24 --> 02:21:36.92
macumbo with the kettlebells and this kind of the squat probably it's weird I used to do that

1540
02:21:36.92 --> 02:21:42.44
with a bar it's there's a lot of little muscles in there yeah that's what makes kettlebell

1541
02:21:42.44 --> 02:21:48.68
is good is that there's unstable there less stable than a barbell yeah and they move awkwardly

1542
02:21:48.68 --> 02:21:54.04
yeah so you have to use more energy and more strength to keep them under control yeah so

1543
02:21:54.04 --> 02:21:57.48
it's working some muscles that you're not used to most likely yeah and you're it's

1544
02:21:57.48 --> 02:22:03.08
it's interesting because you're using like you can get into this kind of it's not weird

1545
02:22:03.08 --> 02:22:10.28
but it this flow of like you know like when it swings down it's not like oh it doesn't jerk you

1546
02:22:10.28 --> 02:22:14.28
down it will if you're not ready for it but if you kind of know after you get used to it it just

1547
02:22:14.28 --> 02:22:21.24
flows just like this almost know impact yep kettlebells are good yeah so do that anyway

1548
02:22:21.24 --> 02:22:27.64
where would you get your kettlebells from I get my kettlebells from on it I only get the

1549
02:22:27.64 --> 02:22:31.64
coins actually afterwards and I had a picture I was gonna post it online too but I was like

1550
02:22:32.52 --> 02:22:39.80
you were feeling it was less about that at that point you know but one I again the where

1551
02:22:39.80 --> 02:22:45.40
will forms so and Joe Rogan's on one of the videos on there he kind of mentions is he's like I

1552
02:22:45.40 --> 02:22:49.24
like this one because it's like I think it's like the gorilla or something like that he's like

1553
02:22:49.24 --> 02:22:55.88
it looks at you and it's like it wants to he says you know he says that the gorilla looks like he

1554
02:22:55.88 --> 02:23:01.16
wants to bite your dick off that's what he says something along this line but he has a good point like

1555
02:23:01.16 --> 02:23:05.24
those kettlebells when you're like man I really don't want to do this and then they're just looking at

1556
02:23:05.24 --> 02:23:09.40
you you know and you're like tank you walk away you come back and you look at it and it's still

1557
02:23:09.40 --> 02:23:12.76
looking at you with the same expression because it's you know kettlebells because it's an

1558
02:23:12.76 --> 02:23:22.36
ain't even an object you know because you get into the workout you know you know especially like

1580
02:25:37.64 --> 02:25:42.20

1581
02:25:42.20 --> 02:25:48.36
anger management it's not that it's it's literally like there's little games like mine brain

1582
02:25:48.36 --> 02:25:52.84
exercises in there you know it's just everything and they're really short chapters they're just

1583
02:25:52.84 --> 02:25:58.84
little things and that one chapter happened to be about dealing with anger anyway Michael Powell

1589
02:26:26.52 --> 02:26:31.32
subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already iTunes Stitcher Google Play which everyone you

1590
02:26:31.32 --> 02:26:39.000
prefer I think iTunes is a most popular but I see significant references to Google Play

1591
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:46.20
in general society you know also a lot of them it's a Stitcher yeah you know how like a lot of

1592
02:26:46.20 --> 02:26:52.28
them people they don't want to go mainstream you know it's like like they like keep it old school

1593
02:26:52.28 --> 02:26:59.08
yeah you're around yeah you know it makes sense you know what's the old saying don't go with

1594
02:26:59.08 --> 02:27:05.16
their herd or back less traveled you know one of the same same deal same deal same deal so I get it

1595
02:27:05.16 --> 02:27:11.88
Google Play up but good news is we're on all of them and I just want to choose your avenue also

1596
02:27:12.52 --> 02:27:19.72
YouTube subscribe to our YouTube channel so we do have YouTube channel talk about every week but

1597
02:27:20.52 --> 02:27:27.56
not only does it have the video version of this podcast has excerpts and deluxe excerpts

1598
02:27:27.56 --> 02:27:33.24
what are those excerpts that you have enhanced we'll just say enhanced steps excerpts also you know what

1599
02:27:33.24 --> 02:27:40.52
man I have this other idea you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make little we'll just say other

1600
02:27:40.52 --> 02:27:48.04
little videos too that's what I'm gonna do step-ad value so to speak I like that well the video is a

1601
02:27:48.04 --> 02:27:55.88
very compelling form of interaction with people yeah that's why that's why YouTube I think YouTube

1602
02:27:55.88 --> 02:28:02.04
is like the most searched website bigger than it's more searched than Google maybe I'm wrong but

1603
02:28:02.04 --> 02:28:06.28
it's up there it's if it's not number one it's number two so if you want to learn something people

1604
02:28:06.28 --> 02:28:10.92
immediately yes search YouTube yeah that's what and guess what remember the other day we talked about

1605
02:28:10.92 --> 02:28:17.40
YouTube red yeah I got YouTube red oh like the ads the ads is one thing but also

1606
02:28:18.28 --> 02:28:24.36
because you can listen to music without it being on the screen it plays in the background like

1607
02:28:24.36 --> 02:28:29.72
iTunes that the main reason yeah it's now I can get any album that of there's a lot of music

1608
02:28:29.72 --> 02:28:35.56
a lot of music that I listen to isn't on iTunes because it's old school it's hardcore it's

1609
02:28:35.56 --> 02:28:39.96
underground like literally not on there yeah but the YouTube videos are crazy how it's

1610
02:28:39.96 --> 02:28:49.24
YouTube video beyond there from some random hardcore band from New York upstate New York

1611
02:28:49.80 --> 02:28:56.52
and they're there there they're one album that they made they're one EP five songs long

1612
02:28:56.52 --> 02:29:04.28
that came out in 1987 it'll be on YouTube it's not anywhere near iTunes it's on it and you can play it

1613
02:29:04.28 --> 02:29:10.92
which is awesome yeah make sense I guess they YouTube read sometimes they'll put or not

1614
02:29:10.92 --> 02:29:15.64
sometimes all of times you have YouTube read now no because the main selling point from is that the

1615
02:29:15.64 --> 02:29:23.88
albums without tracks just that you like albums with tracks is your outs without tracks well

1616
02:29:23.88 --> 02:29:28.92
typically I don't listen to YouTube for the music situation not where I go to yeah if you have

1617
02:29:28.92 --> 02:29:33.80
read you'll change that yeah maybe I mean read they push it with hey no ads and then I'm like cool

1618
02:29:33.80 --> 02:29:39.000
no ads but man I'm not that quick to jump on the no ads thing I there have been plenty of times

1619
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:46.04
right a lot of times with movies but the ads that play I like it'll be for me directed for me like

1620
02:29:46.04 --> 02:29:53.24
dang this ad is helping me yeah yeah yeah the ultimate YouTube person not only click the next video

1621
02:29:53.24 --> 02:29:57.96
I'm gonna enjoy the advertisement yeah I get the title as ads a lot you know that is right

1622
02:29:57.96 --> 02:30:05.32
title it's he's a super smart guy he's actually one of the reasons why like I started reading a lot

1623
02:30:05.32 --> 02:30:10.84
like one of the reasons and so his smart guy but his ads are all over YouTube but I know it's my fault

1624
02:30:10.84 --> 02:30:17.24
because it's relevant to what I watch apparently oh they do that so it's my fault but those

1625
02:30:17.24 --> 02:30:23.72
ads I get title this should you go to college yeah you know I'm talking about anyway yeah so yeah

1658
02:33:48.36 --> 02:33:54.60
know what that is it's an album with tracks of jocquoise voice saying and telling helping

1659
02:33:55.80 --> 02:34:03.48
it's what it's doing it's helping people myself included by the way through moments of weakness

1660
02:34:04.20 --> 02:34:13.56
if they arrive arise all right so yeah if you're having trouble or one day if you want an alarm clock

1661
02:34:13.56 --> 02:34:19.32
of me which people ask me for yeah just gets psychological warfare and said it is your alarm

1662
02:34:19.32 --> 02:34:24.28
yeah that's it that's why we made it because everyone was asking for that so there you have it you don't

1663
02:34:24.28 --> 02:34:28.52
need to you don't need it we're not going to make a ringtone I don't think yeah we'll tell you

1664
02:34:28.52 --> 02:34:33.40
technically you just said it as a ringtone and you're good yeah yeah yeah and it works really

1665
02:34:33.40 --> 02:34:38.20
good especially that well it depends on your weakness right or what kind of person you are so you know

1666
02:34:38.20 --> 02:34:45.48
me if you say a echo wake up at 430 for one year every morning one year there's going to be a

1667
02:34:45.48 --> 02:34:51.000
day or two where it's going to be harder than you know I don't know the day so put on the track

1668
02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:58.76
what time do you wake up that's classified so it's you have problems I can't predict that's

1669
02:34:58.76 --> 02:35:09.16
like a noon I woke up at noon on Saturday okay just on a while in time do you wake up at noon

1674
02:35:31.72 --> 02:35:37.08
no it's bad not gonna make a change nonetheless back to psychological warfare if you have you

1675
02:35:37.08 --> 02:35:43.08
know if you're on a cool diet your eating is clean boom you get that temptation one day at work

of it's how much of a violation is you can get your employees and you can feed them while you're out

1681
02:36:11.16 --> 02:36:16.52
yeah hey look look how cute your kids are kids let me give them something super unhealthy

1682
02:36:18.28 --> 02:36:22.52
violation anyway that's what happens when people bring doughnuts for work and think oh I'm gonna do this

1683
02:36:22.52 --> 02:36:28.92
for the office not that I frown upon them just saying put it into perspective nonetheless if someone

1684
02:36:28.92 --> 02:36:33.80
does that while you're at work boom you got to track with that too just put it on real quick put

1685
02:36:33.80 --> 02:36:38.36
on your butt you know so it's for you sugar coated lies you're coated lies directly into your

1686
02:36:38.36 --> 02:36:42.92
anyway it's called psychological warfare look at it on or look for it on iTunes chocolate

1687
02:36:42.92 --> 02:36:48.52
google play google play Amazon music all that stuff yeah like good stuff wherever the MP3s are

1688
02:36:48.52 --> 02:36:56.36
being distributed all right also on amazon you can get chocolate tea and here's a little verified

1689
02:36:56.36 --> 02:37:02.36
purchase review again this means that the person these verified yeah is a hundred percent so here's

1690
02:37:02.36 --> 02:37:08.04
the review as a tea guy I am somewhat picky so I ordered some chocolate tea I'm pretty sure the box

1691
02:37:08.04 --> 02:37:17.16
was growling when I opened it that's a verified review I brewed up some tea and poured it over ice

1692
02:37:17.16 --> 02:37:21.96
after which I went on my bike for training ride I was pulled over twice I explained that I had

1693
02:37:21.96 --> 02:37:26.12
consumed some chocolate tea before I left in the officer just nodded and said get after it

1694
02:37:27.40 --> 02:37:34.92
the next officer was not so forgiving and gave me a ticket for speed limit so in summary this

1695
02:37:34.92 --> 02:37:39.32
team can get pretty pricey if you don't mind speeding tickets while you're writing a bike so as just

1696
02:37:39.32 --> 02:37:44.36
another thing to be careful of if drink joccal weight tea and then you get on a bike you got to watch

1697
02:37:44.36 --> 02:37:47.64
out that you don't get speeding tickets because you're gonna be going a little faster than the speed limit

1698
02:37:48.68 --> 02:37:56.04
that's the joccal weight tea also on amazon you can get away the warrior kid and this
