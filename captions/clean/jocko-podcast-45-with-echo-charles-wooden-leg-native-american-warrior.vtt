00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jocco podcast number 45 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Good evening, echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I often think that if I were an Indian, I would greatly prefer to cast my lot among those of my people who had here to the free open plane.

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Rather than submit to the confined limits of a reservation, there to be the recipient of the blessed gifts of civilization,

5
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
when its vices thrown in without stint or measure.

6
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And that is a quote from a book called My Life on the Plains published in 1876 by a guy named General Custer, who wrote that book or was published a few months before he died at the Battle of Little Big Horn.

7
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But we're not going to look at that book today.

8
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Even though that battle, the Battle of Little Big Horn is something we'll definitely delve into.

9
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There's a ton of lessons learned there.

10
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You know, a whole, all those, all the American soldiers were killed in this one unit of General Custers.

11
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There was no survivors from it. He lost like 200 guys, all of himself included.

12
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And it was, there was some survivors from some of the other companies that were along with him.

13
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There's a guy named Major Reno and another guy named Kat and Benteen and they had people that survived in their company actually a lot of their company survived.

14
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
None of, none of Colonel Custer's or General Custer's true survived.

15
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And as I was thinking about doing that battle, because there's so many good lessons to learn about a lot of lessons to learn about arrogance and overconfidence and splitting force.

16
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There's just a really good bunch of good tactical lessons to learn from it.

17
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And as I dove into it, I ended up coming across another firsthand account from an Indian.

18
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, I use the term Indian because instead of the term Native American, which is probably the, which is the correct nomenclature, but in this book, that, that we're going to go over tonight.

19
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's from a Native American who name is Wooden Leg.

20
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And throughout the book, he calls himself an Indian. He calls all of his fellow Native Americans, calls Moll Indians.

21
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So you're going to hear me call him Indians throughout this evening.

22
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Now, what I found though is as I wanted to learn more about the battle, I started getting into the whole Native American.

23
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
What they went through what they were like and that culture.

24
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And so this book did a great job of kind of exploring that.

25
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And this, this shi-yan warrior.

26
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Like I said, named Wooden Leg and the name of the book is Wooden Leg, a warrior who fought custard.

27
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But like I said, that's actually a small portion of the book, but it gives us some good insight as to what life was like for these Native Americans back on the planes in that transitional period.

28
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Where they were going from being living open on the planes to getting moved on to reservations and some of the fighting that they did and how they grew up.

29
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Now, where this came from, there was the author of this book, who was a guy that was a doctor and served a few months as an agency physician for the Northern Shians.

30
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So that's the tribe that was allied with the Su Indians and they were around and part of the annihilation of custard.

31
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And this doctor, Dr. Marquis actually learned the language.

32
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And so when he was up there living on the reservation, he would constantly ask, you know, hey, didn't anyone fight custard?

33
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Was any around for these battles? We just just not just custard, but he's, you know, specifically interesting that one since it was no.

34
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I witnessed survivors from the American side. He wanted to find out what happened.

35
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And as he interviewed all these different Indians, eventually got to this guy, Wooden Leg.

36
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And I'll go to the book here. It says Wooden Leg became the author's favorite narrator.

37
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It seemed that his lifetime biography should surround his special battle story so that readers might learn what kind of people were the hostile Indians of that day.

38
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So this is again, Marquis. It's a doctor living up on the reservation and working on people and learn the language, communicated with him.

39
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And one of his favorite old time warriors that he talked to was this guy by the name of Wooden Leg.

40
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And I'll start with how he ended up with that name Wooden Leg.

41
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And I'm going to the book.

42
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
This crow, Cheyenne, Indian man, was a wonderful traveler on foot.

43
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Even as a boy, he could outwalk and wear down most of the young men who journeyed with him.

44
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
His capabilities in this regard were so noticeable that people said his legs must be made of wood.

45
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Since he never becomes tired, then they fixed upon the name Wooden Leg.

46
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I was also a youthful wonder in the matter of walking.

47
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
By this is Wooden Leg himself talking. So he was describing someone else who is actually a relative of his.

48
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And he was talking about himself. By the time I was 15 years old, I could go all day following in the footsteps of my Uncle Wooden Leg.

49
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I was tall and gone and I grew taller and young manhood.

50
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Friends began jokingly to apply me the name of this endearing of during and during Uncle.

51
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Who then had become a middle aged or elderly man.

52
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I liked the name. I liked the man who bore it.

53
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And I liked the honor of comparison with him.

54
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I told my father I wish to be known as Wooden Leg.

55
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It was a common custom to pass down names to junior relatives.

56
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000
My father told me that when the time was right, he would confer that new name upon me.

57
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
The time came when I was about 17 years old.

58
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So that's where the origin of his name comes from.

59
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We're going to get to the part where he actually takes the full name and that becomes his name Wooden Leg.

60
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's after an eventful. We'll say an eventful time period.

61
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So here's some a little bit about being raised out there against Cheyenne country.

62
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
When I was six years old, I asked my father will you give me a horse?

63
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yes, you may have any horse in mind that you want, but you must catch him.

64
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
He gave me a raw-hide, lary at rope.

65
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So there you go. Yo, you want a horse? Cool.

66
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Here's a rope. Go catch one.

67
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
He and my mother and some other people laughed about it, but I took the matter seriously.

68
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
With the lary at looped and coiled, I went out among the herd to search for horses belonging to my father.

69
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So he goes out. He finds a small pony.

70
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Eventually he gets it. He captures it.

71
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And when it quieted down, I followed carefully along the line, talking soothingly until it allowed me to pad its neck.

72
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
After a while, I got its mouth around the lower jaw, the loop of the raw-hide, according to the old Indian way of making a bridal.

73
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
When it had calmed after this new advance, I began to make strokes on its back.

74
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Then I took the long coiled into my belt, the same as I had seen men do, and I climbed quickly upon the animal.

75
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It shied, and I fell off, but I still had my rope, this uncoiling from my belt as the pony moved away.

76
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I seized the tether and followed again its guidance to the coveted mount, more petting and soothing talk, another attempt at riding, off again.

77
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Before making a third try, I spent a long time at the gentle, taming procedures.

78
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Nevertheless, the pony shied and then bucked after I had mounted it, but I grabbed its mane and stuck to my seat within a few minutes,

79
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I had control. I rode to my father's lodge.

80
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Yes, that is your pony to keep, he told me.

81
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Bands of us boys went out at times on horseback to hunt wolves. We had only bows and arrows.

82
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We killed many wolves with arrows. My father had given me a good bow in a supply of arrows when I was nine or ten years old.

83
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We were then in black hills countries, country.

84
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I know we have people in America definitely that still are hunting at a very young age, but it's pretty cool that you're six years old,

85
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
breaking horses and then out hunting with bows and arrows by the way hunt wolves.

86
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It's awesome.

87
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So back to the book. My mother said to me, we have no meat.

88
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Another boy and I set off to hunt. We were about the same age 15 years old.

89
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We each had on a shirt, leggings and moccasins, all of buck skin or other skin.

90
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The leggings had no seat in them as was the Indian way of clothing the lower limbs.

91
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
We had no head coverings nor any mittens for our hands.

92
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Although we are accustomed to hardship, this was a cold day for us.

93
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
We waited and wallowed through snow up to our knees and thighs.

94
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So again, nowadays we got smart wool hats and Gore-Tex jackets.

95
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We just got it so easy.

96
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And here you go. You're in moccasins.

97
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And you got bare ass. You got to bare ass and you're just out with some leggings on.

98
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Just get after it and knee deep snow.

99
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Just hardcore. Hardcore.

100
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It goes a little old. They continue this hunt and then back to the book.

101
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I dear jump out and start looking us.

102
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The first shot from my rifle brought it down.

103
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We rushed it and cut it through.

104
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
We hurriedly cut open the body and jammed our hands inside to get warm.

105
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Yeah.

106
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The show's shownies, the crows and the ponies were tribes.

107
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
We fought most during my time of growing up to manhood.

108
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So this is another thing that they talked about a lot in this book is that

109
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
the Native Americans were fighting each other all the time.

110
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
They were at war.

111
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
They were at war with each other.

112
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And he talks about that a lot.

113
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Back to the book. My own youthful warrior experiences were mostly in combat against the crows and the show

114
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
showies.

115
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
One incident out of many in this kind of warfare will show you how it was carried on.

116
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
A band of showtakes came at night and stole some of our horses.

117
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
We were camped on a divide between the upper part of the tongue river and the little big horn.

118
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Snow deep and winter weather.

119
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I was 16 years old. I went with a party of shions who took the trail of the thieves.

120
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
After traveling all day and into the night we found a small camp of showshonies.

121
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Most of them alarmed by their dogs had fled when we made our attack upon them.

122
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But repeated shots kept coming from a single certain lodge.

123
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We concentrated our assault on this lodge.

124
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Two shions were killed and another one mortally wounded before we could suppress this destructive defense.

125
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
White wolf, 11 years older than I,

126
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:32.000
was then I was and yet living as my neighbor on Tong River was the brave warrior who dealt the final blow to that showshone.

127
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
White wolf crept along the ground into the lodge.

128
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
He had in his right hand a six shooter.

129
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It was totally dark in there and he fumbled about the interior seeking whomever he might find.

130
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
His gun bumped into somebody and he pulled the trigger.

131
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Later developments re-evealed this is the only occupant of the lodge.

132
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The victim was an old man. He was the only shoshone we killed in that fight so far as we could learn.

133
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
But we won the battle and got back on our horses.

134
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We cut up the body of the old shoshone man.

135
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
We cut off his hands, his feet, his head.

136
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
We ripped open his breast and belly.

137
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I stood there and looked at his heart and liver.

138
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We tore down the lodge built a bonfire of its contents and piled the remnants of the dead body upon this bonfire.

139
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:31.000
We stayed there until nothing was left but ashes and coals.

140
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So these guys are getting after it.

141
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
They're definitely up.

142
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And which really cool is like,

143
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I didn't want to break up this but you know you've got to soul- happening.

144
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This could be a story about American soldiers going against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan or in Surgeons in Iraq.

145
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We're taking down a small village and there's people and there's enemy in there.

146
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And they're building and there's concentrated fire coming from there.

147
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And you get a guy that low crawls up.

148
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is just a straight warfare.

149
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
It's amazing how that story could translate until most modern era with when you have guns.

150
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Except the part where they cut off the hands and the head.

151
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Except for the part where they cut off the hands, cut off the head, rip open the breast and the belly.

152
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Yeah.

153
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
They're taking it to a different level right there.

154
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And you know I think it's...

155
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
He put that in there.

156
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I mean he's telling these stories and it offers you an insight as to what their attitude was and what they're going to do if you got captured.

157
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Yeah.

158
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It's on.

159
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Back to the book.

160
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Little Wolf had been a big tribal chief.

161
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The most influential one for about two years before that time.

162
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And his earlier manhood, he was for a long time chosen over and over again as the leading chief of the elk or your society.

163
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000
If during any time any shyan was looked upon as the bravest of man of all, he was the man.

164
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
He was never afraid to speak the truth.

165
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The people all believed in him.

166
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
He was a gentle and charitable man but if insulted to anger he was likely to hurt somebody.

167
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
In either disturbed or undisturbed mood everybody knew he meant just what he said.

168
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
He was my uncle by marriage.

169
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
One of his two wives being a sister of my father.

170
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
He used to tell me many thrilling stories both at his lodge and my father's lodge.

171
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I recall one in particular when he had hand-to-hand combat with a shoshone.

172
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Each had a sheath knife.

173
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
They grappled and wrestled and slashed one another.

174
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Finally, Little Wolf pinned in the arms of the shoshone through him to the ground, plunged upon him and stabbed him to death.

175
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000
He gave me a great deal of good advice both as to warfare and as to how to carry myself up rightly as a man among my own.

176
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:11.000
My conduct all throughout my life has been influenced by his teachings more than by those of any other preceptor except my own father.

177
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So that's Little Wolf.

178
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Little Wolf was the badass.

179
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Little Wolf was the big badass.

180
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And I thought it was important to kind of talk about his characteristics.

181
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He spoke the truth. People believed him. He was gentle and charitable.

182
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
But if he was angered, he was going to hurt you.

183
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So this is the guy that they choose as their leader.

184
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Back to the book.

185
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I think my body grew more rapidly than my mind did.

186
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
This is not uncommon for men and boys.

187
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Right? Your body grows before your mind does absolutely back the book. By the time I was 18 years old, I was the tallest men of the tribe.

188
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I believe there were two who stood a little above me. Both of these were killed in the great battle against the soldiers of Custer.

189
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
My friend, the white man, doctor measures me now at six feet, two inches and weighs me at 235 pounds.

190
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So we're talking about a big dude.

191
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Wooden leg was no joke.

192
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I don't know. I grew up in New England.

193
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
When you go to old houses in New England that were built in the 1700s,

194
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I don't know if you know this, but the ceilings are lower.

195
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
The doors are lower because people were shorter.

196
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Like all people were shorter.

197
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Can you imagine being where the average height is probably 5-5 and Wooden leg is 6-2 monster guy?

198
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:51.000
So now they're, they're, you talk a little bit about just again this continuing on with his life living in the black hills.

199
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Here we hunted the game and the enemy grows and shoshones.

200
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And here we lived in every way the life of the planes Indians of those times.

201
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
It was not an idol existence.

202
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000
We were busy much of the time fighting our enemies, gathering food and clothing and sheltering skins.

203
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
As we were camped on the lower tongue river when I was about 9 years old, one morning a herald started to cry out.

204
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
All of our horses are gone.

205
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
They're followed a lively stir among the young men.

206
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
A party of them mounted on a few horses that had been overlooked by the raiders and hurried away on the trail.

207
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
A thin snow helped them.

208
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
In the late afternoon they called up with the lost herd apparently abandoned.

209
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
But after a search of the vicinity they discovered that somebody was in a canyon cave there.

210
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
One of the shiands crawled into the cave in an endeavor to verify the supposition.

211
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
The verification came in the form of an arrow that hit him in the right eye.

212
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
He quickly backed out.

213
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Everybody bring wood the shiand leader ordered.

214
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
They built a fire at the cave's opening.

215
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
With blankets they fan the flames and the smoke into the hole.

216
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The prisoners fan outward and thrust sticks at the fire heap to push it away.

217
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Bring more wood the leader called.

218
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
The one-sided contest went on until the two crow-endied men burst out from the cave.

219
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Almost suffocated and indesparation.

220
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
The first one was beaten and stabbed a death by their surrounding shiands.

221
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
The second one got past them spraying upon one of their horses and dashed away.

222
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
The shiands pursued him.

223
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
He happened to mount a slow animal, so it was not long before the chase developed into a beating by ponywips and handles.

224
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
The crow suddenly jerked his mount to his sand still.

225
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
At the same moment he flashed out his sheath knife and made a vicious sideways stab.

226
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
The blade buried itself from the breast of a shiand who fell dead.

227
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
The other shiands rushed upon the crow in a twinkling.

228
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
He had received many death blows from various weapons.

229
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Somebody scouted them and they caught off his feet.

230
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Hands and head.

231
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Again, it's interesting.

232
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
What do they do? They got a guy in a situation.

233
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
They got him trapped in a cave.

234
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
How do they get him out of there?

235
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
What do we do nowadays?

236
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Maybe we throw some tear gas in there.

237
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
What do they do?

238
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:30.000
They build a fire, smoke them out.

239
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
A little bit more about the life of the shiands.

240
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Competitive sports used to interest us.

241
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Horse races, foot races, wrestling matches, target shooting with guns or arrows,

242
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
tossing the arrows by hand, swimming, jumping or other light contest were entered upon.

243
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
The tribe's competition was usually between men representing the three warrior societies.

244
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Inside the tribe there were three separate warrior societies.

245
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Like three different clubs basically.

246
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Back to the book, these were the elk warriors, the crazy dog warriors and the fox warriors.

247
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
If any suetribe or big band camp, jointly or big band, jointly camp,

248
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
the matches were between representatives of the two tribes.

249
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
That's where made on every kind of contest.

250
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
The stakes were of guns, ammunition, bows, arrows, blankets, horses, robes, jewelry, shirts,

251
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
leggings, moccasins, everything in the line of personal property.

252
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
The betting always was on even terms.

253
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Articles were piled upon a blanket, matched articles and opposition to another.

254
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
The winners took all and shouted over the victory.

255
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So these guys were heavily involved in competition, because competition makes you better.

256
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
This reminds me of the seal teams like everything in the seal teams competition.

257
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I don't care what you're doing.

258
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Your buddies say, hey, you want to go for a just a mellow run on the beach.

259
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
You know, yeah, sure, no problem.

260
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
As the next thing you're throwing up from the end because you're pushing each other so hard.

261
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Every thing, every time you get on the range, it's a shooting contest.

262
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Every time you go, everything you do is you go for a skydive.

263
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Oh, how close did you get to the T when you land?

264
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
So everything is a contest and that's how these guys are doing.

265
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
This is what keeps them sharp.

266
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Back to the book, a good wrestler and general strongman was Little Hawk.

267
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And so this one here, Little Hawk, and a guy named Buffalo Hump and Brave Wolf,

268
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
they go around and they meet up with another tribe.

269
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
And they roll in and he says, we need meat.

270
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
They announced, you're drying poles are too full and we think our wants can be supplied here.

271
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Little Hawk wants to wrestle for it.

272
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
If anybody here can throw them, we shall not take any food from this lodge.

273
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Nobody wanted to accept this challenge.

274
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
The young men took some meat and went on to another T.P.

275
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
There, they made the same kind of announcement in proposition.

276
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
They're likewise all the men present fear to grapple with Little Hawk.

277
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And they're also the three joking robbers help themselves from the Bountiful Store.

278
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
At the next T.P., the transaction was more complex.

279
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
After some exchange of talk, the spokesman of the lodge said, Big thigh is here.

280
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
He says he will wrestle you.

281
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Now I'll tell you right now.

282
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I don't want to wrestle Big thigh.

283
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Right?

284
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Big thigh sounds like he's got some game.

285
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
The conditions of the match were agreed upon, but two men stripped to their breach cloths.

286
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
A group of onlookers assembled, the group soon became a great crowd.

287
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Big thigh and Little Hawk appear equally confident.

288
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Both of them rushed into the grapple.

289
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
They tugged and shoved and tripped.

290
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
The advantage seemed to shift back and forth.

291
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
The throng of spectators whooped and danced.

292
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
There was some part of his ensuring, but most of it was merely the expression of delight

293
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
as witnessing this tribal championship battle.

294
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
After several minutes of fierce and continuous struggling, Little Hawk began to weaken and wilt.

295
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Big thigh, pinion the arms of his antagonist and bore him face downward to the ground.

296
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Got his back.

297
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
The victor sat astride the back of the vanquished and sprinkled handfuls of dirt upon him.

298
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
He also picked up a folded blanket nearing by nearby and used this as a soft club and pretense

299
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
at a beating into complete submission.

300
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
The defeated Little Hawk.

301
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
That's a legit jujitsu match right there.

302
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Got the back.

303
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Got the back mount.

304
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Got the submission.

305
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Well, he took it a little far with the rolled up blanket.

306
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Yeah, but it was still only a blanket.

307
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
He was being cool about it.

308
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
He didn't cut his head hands and feet off the floor.

309
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Yeah, that's for sure.

310
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So another thing that's interesting is just how they were organized and their leadership,

311
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
the way they were set up.

312
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
So here we go back to the book.

313
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
The warrior societies were the foundation of tribal government among the shiands.

314
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
That is the number, the members of the warrior societies elected the chiefs who governed the people.

315
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Every 10 years, the whole tribe would get together for the special purpose of choosing 40 big chiefs.

316
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:27.000
These 40 would then select four past chiefs or old men chiefs to serve as supreme advisors to them and the tribe.

317
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
There were not any hereditary chiefs among the shiands.

318
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So that's a pretty cool system.

319
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I like that system.

320
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I think I like that system better than our system right now.

321
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
They end up, they kind of elect 40 chiefs.

322
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
And then from those 40 chiefs, those 40 chiefs take three more or four more to make the old men chief.

323
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
So at one point, they decide that they're going to move camp, which they do from time to time.

324
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And they, the leaders in the morning, they make an announcement.

325
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
And here it is.

326
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
All shiands open your ears and listen.

327
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Tomorrow morning we move to Tung River.

328
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Have your lodges down and yourselves and horses ready.

329
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
The fox warriors will lead us.

330
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
The next morning, as we all prepared for the move, the fox warriors assembled out forward in the direction of the intended movement.

331
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
The old man heralded, instructed them.

332
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
You are the leaders today.

333
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Make all the people obey you.

334
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Make them stay in their proper places.

335
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
If any of them disobey our ordinary rules of travel, you may pony whip them.

336
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
You may shoot their horses. You may kill their dogs.

337
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
You may break their guns or their bows.

338
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000
You may punish them in any way that seems to you best, except you are not allowed to kill any shiain.

339
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
So that's one of the rules you're going to hear that throughout.

340
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
They're not allowed to kill each other no matter what.

341
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And you know, this is kind of an iron hand way of ruling.

342
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Hey, if you get out of line on this road march, we're going to do.

343
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
You're going to feel the pain.

344
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
So they're not going to get much resistance.

345
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Now, speaking of weapons and you've heard him talk about breaking bows.

346
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And this is just kind of giving you some insight on what they use for weapons.

347
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
The arrow was the preferred weapon on a tribal hunt in Buffalo herd.

348
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Or on a large party, we're joined in pursuit.

349
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Each rider shot arrow after arrow into whatever animal was convenient to him during the tumult of the running chase.

350
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:40.000
When it ended, he had one or two more arrows in various dead buffalo scattered over the area by the flight of the herd.

351
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Every man kept his own arrows and always marked in some peculiar manner nearby they could be identified.

352
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000
So when the field was reviewed after the termination of the killing, he could find out which buffalo he had killed or it helped the kill.

353
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
It could be learned in such instance which arrow was the fatal one and which were of little or no importance.

354
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Thus the claims to the skin and meat could be settled.

355
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
In case of a disagreement, the chiefs decided to question.

356
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Gun bullets could not be distinguished from one another, so the guns were used only when one man was hunting alone or when a small party of special friends hunted together.

357
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000
The guns also had to have powder and lead and caps which we did not always have on hand.

358
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
We could make arrows or we often recovered them from the dead animal.

359
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
So that's just imagine you go these big herd of buffaloes and bunch of Indians go in there.

360
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
They're shooting them with all these just shoot every animal you see.

361
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
You try and shoot them and eventually find out which ones are dead.

362
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
You check that matter of mine got him in the heart that gets a meat there.

363
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
That's cool.

364
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
So other people like me knew and you know 40 other guys were shooting.

365
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Just shooting.

366
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
10 arrows in there.

367
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
8 different guy shot this one.

368
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
We all get it.

369
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And then they can just they can tell oh it out and hit the heart.

370
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
So you're the main guy, you know.

371
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Thanks.

372
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
You get the skin.

373
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Yep.

374
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Okay.

375
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Other weapons spears were used by the shyans.

376
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
The long and slender points might be of metal or they might be of stone or bone.

377
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Great care was taken in its coloring and general design.

378
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
The Sue had knife sticks for fighting.

379
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
These had long shafts.

380
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
The same as a spear but instead of the attached point at the end,

381
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
there were three blades at the shaft side.

382
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
So that's kind of a unique looking weapon.

383
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yeah.

384
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
It kind of sounds mad, maxish.

385
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Yeah.

386
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
A long spear with three knives sticking on it.

387
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Yeah.

388
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Hweins kind of had that two.

389
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Well it's a little differently put the shark.

390
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
The shark teeth.

391
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
So it's like a yeah it's pretty dope.

392
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Actually don't want to get hit with the shark teeth.

393
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And not know.

394
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Talking about a little bit of the dress.

395
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
The earrings of an Indian often indicated his tribal

396
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
stock.

397
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
A shyan ear had but one piercing.

398
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Only one ring.

399
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And this ring was looped directly through or close up to the ear.

400
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
The Sue wore necklaces regularly in single strands.

401
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Eagle feathers stuck up from the back hair of many a Sue.

402
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
The number of such feathers were worn by anyone man was supposed to note the number of enemies he had killed.

403
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
The shyans never adopted this custom.

404
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:30.000
All the best clothing was taken along with him when any warrior were to set out in search for a conflict.

405
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
The articles were put into a special bag ordinarily a beautifully breed beaded buck skin pouch.

406
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
But perhaps a raw hide one.

407
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
And this was slung at one side of this horse.

408
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
The bag also contained extra moccasins beaded moccasins.

409
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
More bonnets, paints, a mirror, special medicine projects or anything else of this nature.

410
00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:01.000
If a battle seemed about to occur, the warriors first in important preparatory act was to jerk off all his ordinary clothing.

411
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
He then heard we got out his fine garments.

412
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
If he had time to do so he rebraided his hair.

413
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Pain it his face and his own peculiar way.

414
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Did everything needful to prepare himself for presenting his most splendid personal appearance.

415
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
That is he got himself ready to die.

416
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:29.000
The idea of full dress and preparation for battle comes not from a belief that it will add to the fighting ability.

417
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
The preparation is for death.

418
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
In case that should be the result of the conflict.

419
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
War bonnets were not worn by all warriors.

420
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
In fact, there are only a few such distinguished men in each warrior society of our tribe.

421
00:31:47.000 --> 00:32:01.000
It was expected that one should be a student of the fighting art for several years or else that he'd be an unusually apt learner before he should put the crown of eagle feathers.

422
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
He then did so upon his own initiatives.

423
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Or perhaps because the commendurary urgings of his seniors.

424
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
The actmen of profession of fully acquired ability in warfare.

425
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:24.000
A claim of special accomplishment in using cunning and common sense and cool calculation coupled with the bravery attributed to all warriors.

426
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
So if you want to get that big badass headdress, I thought it's pretty interesting.

427
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
You give it to yourself.

428
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Now people can tell you should you deserve it.

429
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
But you make the claim.

430
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
You say, you're up on the man.

431
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And it's interesting.

432
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
I'm going to read those again.

433
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:51.000
It means you have acquired ability in warfare in using cunning, common sense, cool calculation coupled with bravery.

434
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Very, very good definition of a warrior, right?

435
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Back to the book, the whereer was supposed never to ask mercy in battle.

436
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:14.000
If some immature young man pretended to such high standing before it seemed to his companions that he ought to do so, he was twisted and shamed into awaiting his proper time.

437
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:23.000
I first put on my war bonnet when I was 33 years old, 14 years after I had quit the roaming life.

438
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000
After a man had been accepted as a war bonnet man, he remained so throughout his lifetime.

439
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
War chiefs and tribal chiefs ordinarily were war bonnet men.

440
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
But this was not a requirement for these positions.

441
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Pure modesty might keep the bravest and most capable fighter from making the claim.

442
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Also, and admittedly worthy wearer of the war bonnet might not be chosen for or might refuse all official positions.

443
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
The head, the feathered headpiece then was not a sign of public office.

444
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.000
It was a token of individual and personal feeling as to his own fighting capabilities.

445
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Interesting. It's interesting that he obviously thought about the fact that some guys were too humble to claim the war bonnet.

446
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And he actually says some of the best and bravest and most capable of a hundred of deserve, which is in keeping with what we know about humility being the trait and the most critical trait of someone's sick.

447
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000
And it's also interesting that some of the people that were great fighters weren't necessarily going to be good leaders.

448
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
That's a reality.

449
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Reality to this day.

450
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000
There's a little bit about the way they treat each other.

451
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Fighting between shians, either man or woman, women was forbidden by the tribal laws.

452
00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
In case of a fight, some chief near at hand would call out warrior, separate these fighters and whip them.

453
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
The warrior policeman then on duty would respond to the call.

454
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
A band of them would give such punishment as seem to them fitting.

455
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
If the fighters renewed their strife, they might have punishment added.

456
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Might have their TPs torn down, their horses killed, property damage done to them in some other way, any suitable and sufficient punishment.

457
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Except no policeman warrior nor anyone else could lawfully kill a shian.

458
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Pony whips, either the lashes or the heavy stick handles were not customary attacking weapons in a personal fight.

459
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Shians did not use fists as white people do.

460
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Not often did any two women fight.

461
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
If they did, they merely scratched and pulled hair.

462
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
It was more of a comic show than an alarming sight to see two women clawing each other.

463
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:59.000
I never heard of any shian, woman killing another, normal, viciously killing a man, nor did the men kill women.

464
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I used to hear old people talk about a shian named Wounded Elk who had beaten his wife and then shot her, killing her.

465
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I never heard of any other case like that.

466
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
The incident happened before I was born.

467
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Suicides were not uncommon among us.

468
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Men shot themselves, women hung themselves.

469
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Foolish ones, yet do such acts.

470
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
It's interesting you says that the shians did not use their fists as white people do.

471
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
You think we're talking straight grappling?

472
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Yeah, no strikes.

473
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Or is he saying that they struck in a different way?

474
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Maybe they want to break their hands.

475
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
It's a pretty smart move.

476
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Again, a little bit more culture.

477
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
This is one of the little stories.

478
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Two youths, brothers, found one time a wolf's den.

479
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
One of them took his lary at and crawled into the hillside cave to get pups.

480
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
He felt about in the darkness got the rope about a pups hindfeet and dragged it out.

481
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
They knocked it in the head and he went in after another one.

482
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
This time either a pup or an old wolf bit his hand.

483
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
He retreated.

484
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Outside he got a forked stick with this projecting out in front of him he returned to attack upon the wolves.

485
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
The forked end, the forked end got engaged in the hair and skin of the wolf.

486
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
The youth twisted and tugged backing out and dragging after him the snarling and snapping animal.

487
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
The brother stood with his rifle poised and ready to shoot.

488
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Lims have brushed averted his arm and the bullet crashed into the head of the other boy.

489
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
The shocked and weeping brother put the dead body on a horse and took it to their home lodge.

490
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
People flock to sea and hear.

491
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
You killed him in anger.

492
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Somebody accused.

493
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
No, it was an accident he saw about and he explained how it had occurred.

494
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000
A group of warrior policemen went with him out to the wolf's den and there he refers for their observation all the incidents of the happening.

495
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
They became fully satisfied that he had no intention to kill his brother that it was truly accidental.

496
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
The youth was released with no penalty whatsoever.

497
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Got a little blue on blue there.

498
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Even the Native Americans experience the blue on blue situations in the chaos and confusion.

499
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
It's pretty, you know, you think about two little kids crawling to a cave to kill wolves into a wolf den.

500
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
That's awesome.

501
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
The warrior culture, pure warrior culture.

502
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I love it.

503
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Now we get into, I guess, I guess you'd call it their religion.

504
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Right.

505
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And they call it the great medicine is what is what Woodenleg refers to.

506
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And I think the best, as I looked up and tried to research what they mean by the word medicine.

507
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:32.000
I think the closest thing I got is sort of like spirit, spirit, spirituality, spirit that's kind of the word that it means to me is I try to figure out exactly what it meant.

508
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
I don't know if there's a great, but you can see from the context what he means but.

509
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So here we go back to the book.

510
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000
I made medicine for the first time when I was 17 years old and 1875.

511
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:59.000
To make medicine is to engage upon a special period of fasting, thanksgiving, prayer and self denial even of self torture.

512
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
The procedure is an entirely devotional exercise.

513
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:09.000
The purpose is to subdue the passions of the flesh and to improve the spiritual self.

514
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:22.000
The bodily abstinence and the mental concentration upon lofty thoughts cleanses both the body and the soul and puts them into or keeps them in health.

515
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Then the individual mind gets closer toward conformity with the mind of the great medicine above us.

516
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
So that's just awesome.

517
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:44.000
He's talking about fasting, he's talking about focusing on larger things, he's talking about punishing yourself and and you know he's the term self torture.

518
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
This is disciplined.

519
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
So he goes to his medicine man.

520
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
I need red hair bear, red hair bear.

521
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
I want to make medicine.

522
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.000
I told him how he responded in couragely and that's not a question. It's like the statement of how.

523
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
How he responded in couragely. What number of days do you think you can endure?

524
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
The whole four days I replied confidently.

525
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
How he quote, I will help you.

526
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
So he's going to ask that's the, I guess that's the max limit that they go as a four straight days.

527
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:28.000
So it's four straight days by the way on your own no food, no water.

528
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
That's what the deal is.

529
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000
And you bear the elements you can have like a little tent, but you're going to bear the elements.

530
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
As he's preparing to do it, here we go back to the book.

531
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
The medicine man painted my whole body.

532
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Red clay mixed into water and the dish was used for most of the painting.

533
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000
With the black paint he made first a circle about my face, including the forehead, the chin and the cheeks.

534
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Black wristlets and black ankleats were next form.

535
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
On the middle of my breast he painted a black son.

536
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
On my left shoulder blade he put a black mood.

537
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
This is going to be a hard trial for you. The hardest trial you've ever had.

538
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Throughout the four days you will have neither food nor water, your desires will distress you.

539
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Other distresses may be piled upon these.

540
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
You may retreat now and postpone it for another time if you want to do so.

541
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
What say you?

542
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I dread it, I confessed, but I know it will not kill me.

543
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I do not want to wait, I want to go on right now.

544
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:43.000
I shall keep my courage from failing by fixing my thoughts upon being a good man.

545
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Legit.

546
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Going into the ceremony a little bit, here he is.

547
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Hot thirsty, yet more hot and more thirsty.

548
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
I prayed particularly for the strength of body and firmness of heart to carry me through to the end of the trial.

549
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
I loaded my pipe for a sourcing smoke, but it was not a solace.

550
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
The heat burned my already parchment tongue.

551
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
I tried to sleep. Maybe I did sleep, I do not know.

552
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
I made attempts to meditate quietly.

553
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
I do not know whether I was actually thinking or was following dreams racing through my minds.

554
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Mind.

555
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000
All I could be sure about was that I was either sitting down or lying down all the time.

556
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And by the way, when they smoke, the pipe from what I could figure out, they're pretty much smoking generally tobacco with sometimes other herbs that they sometimes would mix with a tobacco.

557
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Willow bark, sue Mac, white sage, just kind of other plants and herbs.

558
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Back to the book, oh, how lonely I was.

559
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
I loaded and lit my pipe. No, it was not good. My mouth and throat were burning water.

560
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Water.

561
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:16.000
But the great medicine sees me. I kept thinking. My thoughts were old and chased each other rapidly in circles.

562
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I dreamt that I heard the footsteps of a horse.

563
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Hey, wooden leg. Hey. This is the day.

564
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Happiness almost filled my heart. The only hindrance was in the thirst and the hot body.

565
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
After I had been let out, we smoked together. It was a torture to my tongue, but I did not complain.

566
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
We went then to my father's lodge in the camp. My father called out an invitation to Old Men, friends.

567
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000
They came and sat in a circle upon the robe spread over the lodges floor. I sat with them by the side of my father.

568
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
My mother brought a bucket full of water and set it off a little distance from me.

569
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I suppressed a strong desire to plunge my face into it, but I could not keep my eyes from staring at it.

570
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Wouldn't leg. You have been four days without water. Now you may drink four sips.

571
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I seized the sides of the bucket. The four sips were four long, drawn mouthfuls.

572
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I waited for more advice. Wouldn't leg. You have been four days without meat.

573
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Take four sliced off bites, one for each day of the fast.

574
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000
I selected a chunk from the plate. I stuck the end of it far into my mouth, and with a sheath knife I cut it off.

575
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
I was the chewing was vigorous, and I soon had it swallowed.

576
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
The chunk was pushed to second time into my mouth, and it's end to cut off there.

577
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
A third and fourth mouthful were taken in the same manner. After a few minutes more meat was allowed to me.

578
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Then still more. All I cared to eat, it was the best meat I ever tasted.

579
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I talked about that the other day. The recalibration of knowing what it's like to actually feel hungry and then how good food tastes when you have an eaten for a while.

580
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Taste good. That's what he's feeling the best meat he ever tasted right there, boom.

581
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Now that's one little ceremony that he went through.

582
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:32.000
He does some more of that. The second medicine experience he does was about a month after that one.

583
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
And he did two days instead of four.

584
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000
So it's something that you kind of, these warriors who kind of continually keep up with.

585
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And back to the book here.

586
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
First, third season of warrior discipline.

587
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.000
I went one morning at dawn to the top of the hill. There I fasted, prayed, meditated, and dreamed all day.

588
00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Another disciplinary means for subduing the flesh was to stand upright all day from sunrise to sunset on a hill.

589
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:07.000
The devotee did not move during that time except to keep his face turned at all times towards the sun.

590
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:19.000
He might keep his eyes closed or shaded, but his countenance had to be presented ever towards the veterinary token of the great medicines existence.

591
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
He prayed or otherwise kept his thoughts fixed on a high plane.

592
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
This system of self-denial was varied by attitude taken.

593
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
One might stand all day or sit in one position all day or lie down during all the time,

594
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
but the attitude assumed at the beginning must be kept to the end.

595
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
My all day supplications were made while sitting down.

596
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Standing upright in water from sunrise to sunset was one way of putting the body under the rule of the spirit.

597
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
The water had to be up to the neck or the upper breast.

598
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Not any drink of it was taken.

599
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000
It was not permissible to move the body except for keeping the face towards the sun.

600
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
So just go get in the water.

601
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
These guys are in Montana.

602
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
They're in Montana.

603
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
They're in Montana.

604
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
They're in Montana.

605
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
It's not cool.

606
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
It's interesting that all different military units do this kind of stuff.

607
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Just going out and standing in a tension which they make you do in the military, which is when you're standing erect with your hands at your side.

608
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
You're moving.

609
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
You do that for hours and hours and hours.

610
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
It's interesting.

611
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
It's like that's not just a coincidence.

612
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
You know what I mean?

613
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
There is a discipline there.

614
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
There's a discipline of the body in doing that and it puts you in touch with your soul.

615
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
You stand there long enough and then like go through shield training.

616
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
You don't think you spend some time neck deep in water.

617
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Just just waiting in a deep cold and enduring absolutely.

618
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Yeah man, yoga can kind of be that.

619
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
You know like certain poses.

620
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
I mean to compare the distance.

621
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
The magnitudes different.

622
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Yeah, definitely.

623
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
You're doing that.

624
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
You're doing it like wall sits.

625
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Yeah.

626
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
That's another one man where it feels physical.

627
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
But at the end of the day it's mental.

628
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Yep.

629
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Like you just want to be okay.

630
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
I'm done.

631
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
But you just think you don't.

632
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
You can endure it.

633
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
But it's gonna take a lot.

634
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Yeah.

635
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
The wall sits are paying for a lot.

636
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
It's a lot of mental after a while and then he goes on to say,

637
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
The bodily torture incident to the full standard.

638
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Great medicine dance.

639
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
What the white people call the Sundance was the most severe test of hardy hood.

640
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
So it was looked upon as the highest form of self-skurging.

641
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
I never undertook this extreme step.

642
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
So the Sundance if you don't know anything about that,

643
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
it's like a multi day.

644
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Fast with physical exertion with like borderline self-tours.

645
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Like didn't appear things and slay the skin open.

646
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
I mean, it's hard core and it got banned for a while and it would known.

647
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
The natives don't want people to like watch it or record it because it's their own personal thing.

648
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
So anyways, you could probably do more research on it's called the Sundance.

649
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
But they do all kinds of really, really hard.

650
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Of course, I've been just, you know,

651
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
devastating hard stuff to go through that hardens your soul up.

652
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
And then, is one more interesting thing here.

653
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Back to the book.

654
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
The face painting as it was done for me by Red Herred Beer,

655
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Bear at my first medicine making was adopted as my fixed mode of battle preparation in this regard.

656
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000
It was a black ring about my face, including lower forehead, chin and cheeks in its circle.

657
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
All of the surface enclosed in that circle was painted yellow.

658
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.000
I kept that all times right at hand a supply of charcoal and yellow clay paint.

659
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
It did not take long for me to apply them when an occasion for their need might come.

660
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.000
With this preparation with my best clothing, my shield, my eagle wingbone whistle,

661
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000
myself and my horse protected by the grass seed medicine, I was almost fearless.

662
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
I was not entirely so, but almost.

663
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:28.000
And every time of danger, I tried to keep myself thinking the great medicine sees me.

664
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Now, there's a note, a historical note that's written.

665
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Now it's going out of the out of wooden legs voice and it's going into a doctor marquee,

666
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
the translator and he's going to put a little note here and I'm going to read it back to the book.

667
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:53.000
In December 1875, pursuant to our governmental policy, General Sherman then commander-in-chief of the United States Army issued an important general order.

668
00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:04.000
He proclaimed that all Indians found off the reservations after the last day of January 1876 would be regarded as hostels to be fought by military forces.

669
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:12.000
It being evident that not many of the Dakota roamers in Montana would return to reservations until they were forced to do so.

670
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Theities of soldiers were set in motion for seeking out and driving these wanderers back within their assigned territorial bounds.

671
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:32.000
The active military field leaders in this campaign were Brigadier General Terry, Brigadier General Crook, Colonel Gibbon and Lieutenant Colonel Custer.

672
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:47.000
These four officers had been bravetted, major general of volunteers during the Civil War. And what that bravetted means that it's like you get a temporary promotion to fill a billet, but you're not getting paid for it.

673
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
And then after it, you get put back.

674
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.000
But the contracting of the Army after the war set each of them back to a lower ranking.

675
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Terry had infantry from Fort Rice and Custer's seventh cavalry from Fort Lincoln, Dakota.

676
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Crook had a force of cavalry and infantry at Fort Fetterman, Wyoming.

677
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Gibbon had infantry from Fort Shaw and cavalry from Fort Ellis, Montana.

678
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:22.000
From there, three basic points in Dakota and Wyoming and Montana, the three bodies of soldiers moved towards a common central area between powder,

679
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
and big horn rivers in Montana, where the Indians being sought were roaming.

680
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
The details of these military movements are too extensive for review here.

681
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:40.000
The most thrilling phase of the campaign began when Custer and his seventh cavalry set off up rose bud valley to follow a recent Indian trail.

682
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
The result of this subsidiary proceeding was the supreme tragedy in the annals of our American Frontier Warfare.

683
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000
And of course, that was the battle at a little big horn.

684
00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Now, like I said, like it just stated, you had these groups and they're out in the plains.

685
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:11.000
And they're, I guess, tracking each other, or at least the soldiers, the US soldiers, the cavalry,

686
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:22.000
or tracking the Indians. And here we go, back to the book, and this is back to the voice of our man, Woodenleg.

687
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
We found the soldiers about seven or eight o'clock in the morning, I believe.

688
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
We had slept only a little, our horses were very tired, so we did not hurry our attack.

689
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000
But always in such cases there are eager or foolish ones who begin to soon.

690
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Not long after we arrived, there was fighting on the hillsides and on the little valley with the soldier camp.

691
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:53.000
In this early fighting, one of the young Cheyenne Fouwisly charged two foreign some Indians belonging to the soldiers got after him.

692
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
So, I'm going to read that again.

693
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:04.000
In this early fighting, one young Cheyenne Fouwisly charged two for and some Indians belonging to the soldiers got after him.

694
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:13.000
So, you have this whole war, there's Indians or Native Americans that are on both sides.

695
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:24.000
There's Native Americans that are working with the US cavalry and the soldiers, and then they're fighting against other Native American tribes.

696
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000
So, back to the book, they shot and crippled his horse.

697
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:37.000
I and some other Cheyenne's drove back the pursuers. I took the young man behind me on my horse and we heard a way to the main body of our warriors.

698
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Jack Red Cloud, the son of the old Ogala Chief Red Cloud, was wearing a war bonnet.

699
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:57.000
His horse was killed. According to the Indian way, in such case, the warrior was supposed to stop and take off the bridal from his killed horse to show how cool he could conduct himself.

700
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000
But young Red Cloud forgot to do this. He went running as soon as his horse fell.

701
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Three crows on horse back followed him, lashed him with their ponywifts and jerked off and kept his war bonnet.

702
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
They did not try to kill him. They only teased him, telling him he was a boy and not to be wearing a war bonnet.

703
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Some of his two friends interfered in the crows went away.

704
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:29.000
The suit told us that young Red Cloud was crying and asking for mercy from the crows. He was my same age 18 years old.

705
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
White Wolf, a Cheyenne almost 30 years old, had a repeating rifle.

706
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
And drawing his weapon from its scabbard at his left side, it was accidentally just discharged.

707
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:48.000
The bullet broke his left thigh bone. He finally recovered and is yet living. This was in 1930. He still limps on account of that accidental wound.

708
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Those are two just little...

709
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000
First of all, young Red Cloud who was wearing a war bonnet.

710
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
And he's supposed to show how cool he is if his horse could shot.

711
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Take that bridal with you. He did not do that.

712
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
And then again, this is an accidental discharge.

713
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Which it does happen occasionally.

714
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
It's really bad to have accidental discharge, obviously.

715
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Especially when you shoot yourself in the leg horrible.

716
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:27.000
So they stay. They continue moving around and they start to move towards a little bit going this river.

717
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:36.000
And back to the book, six aprihobe, a rapoho men came to the Cheyenne camp while we were at this place.

718
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
They said they were afraid of soldiers as they had killed a white man on powder river.

719
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.000
And so now you start to get, and again, I'm kind of moving quickly right now.

720
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:56.000
But there's now multiple tribes are starting to come together in this location.

721
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Multiple tribes.

722
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Each back to the book, each tribe operated its own internal government.

723
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000
The same as if it were entirely separated from the others.

724
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
The chiefs of the different tribes met together as equals.

725
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000
There was only one who's considered as being above all others.

726
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000
This was sitting bull. He was recognized as the one old man chief of all the camps combined.

727
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Almost all of our northern Cheyenne tribe were with us on legal little big horde.

728
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Only a few of our 40 big chiefs were absent.

729
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:35.000
And this is interesting because there's a lot of controversy about how many Indians were there.

730
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000
And some people said there wasn't that many. He said, all of these are all the Cheyenne were there.

731
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
And there was more than just the Cheyenne. So there had to be a bunch of them.

732
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
A bunch of them there.

733
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Now we get into some of these different tribes and chiefs that were there.

734
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:08.000
The principal chiefs of the various camps were for the, for the whoop-papa's was sitting bull.

735
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
The Ogalalas was crazy horse, which we all ever had a crazy horse.

736
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
The Minikonju was lame deer.

737
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Another tribe called Aerosolgon.

738
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000
And they had an important chief called Humpnos.

739
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.000
There was the Black Feet, which wouldn't leg didn't know who is their chief.

740
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
And then you had the Cheyenne.

741
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:34.000
So there's a bunch of massive number of Native American warriors.

742
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Talking about their armament back to the book, guns were not plentiful among us.

743
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Most of our hunting had been with bows and arrows of the Cheyenne's two moons and white wolf each had a repeating rifle.

744
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Some others had single shot, breech loading rifles, but there was not much ammunition for the good guns.

745
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000
So they're mostly using bows and arrows, that's kind of what they have.

746
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And at one point they kind of take their horses and they put them out to graze.

747
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And they think that they had a little scrap with the soldiers and they kind of wasn't bad,

748
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
but they just sort of beat them and it seemed like the soldiers retreated.

749
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And so they put their soldiers out.

750
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I mean, they put their horses out to pasture and it seems like things are going pretty mellow.

751
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And I go back to the book, I had no thought then of any fighting to be done in the near future.

752
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
We had driven away the soldiers on the Upper Rosebed seven days ago.

753
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It seemed likely they would be gone a long time before they would trouble us again.

754
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
My mind was occupied mostly by such thoughts as regularly are uppermost in the minds of young men.

755
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I was 18 years old and I like girls.

756
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
That night we had a dance.

757
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It was an entirely social affair for young people, not ceremonial or war dance.

758
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So there is they kind of gotten a scrap seven days ago.

759
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
They feel like they're pretty safe.

760
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
They put their horses out to pasture.

761
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And then he starts thinking about the ladies.

762
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And they basically party through the whole night.

763
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Back to the book at the first sign of dawn, the dance ended.

764
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And then him and his brother, they kind of take off and they go down by the river and fall asleep.

765
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And that's the end of their night.

766
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Back to the book.

767
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
In my sleep, I dream that a great crowd of people were making lots of noise.

768
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Something in the noise startled me.

769
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I found myself wide awake sitting up and listening.

770
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
My brother too awakened that we both jumped to our feet.

771
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
A great commotion was going on among the camps.

772
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
We heard shooting.

773
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We heard across. We heard out from the trees. So we might see as well as here.

774
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
The shooting was somewhere at the upper part of the camp circles.

775
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It looked as if all the Indians were there.

776
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
There were running away toward the hills to the westward or down toward our end of the village.

777
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Women were screaming and men were letting out war cries.

778
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Through it all, we could hear old men calling soldiers are here.

779
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Young men go out and fight them.

780
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So there they go. They thought they were peaceful.

781
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
But they're about to get it on.

782
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And as he talked about before, what does he do to prepare for battle?

783
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Here we go back to the book.

784
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I jerked off my ordinary clothing.

785
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I jerked on a pair of new breaches that had been given to me by another sue.

786
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I had a good cloth shirt and I put it on.

787
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
My old moccasins were kicked off in a pair of beaten moccasins.

788
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Substitute it for them.

789
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
My father strapped a blanket upon my horse and arranged my raw, high,

790
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
lariat into a bridal. He stood holding my mouth. Hurry here,

791
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I was hurried but I was not ready.

792
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I got my pants in my little mirror.

793
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I, the blue black circles soon appeared around my face.

794
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
The red and yellow colorings were applied on all skin of the inside the circle.

795
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I combed my hair.

796
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It properly should have been oiled and braided neatly, but my father was again saying,

797
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Hurry.

798
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So I just looped to buck skin, thong about it,

799
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and tied it up close to the back of my head to float loose from there.

800
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
My bullets, caps, and powder horn put me into full readiness.

801
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
In a moment afterward I was on my horse, going as fast as I could run,

802
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
to wear all the rest of the young men were going.

803
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
My brother had already gone.

804
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
He got his horse before I got mine,

805
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and his dressing was only a buck string shirt,

806
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
fringe with crow Indian hair.

807
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The hair had been taken from a crow at a past battle with them.

808
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The air was so full of dust I could not see where to go,

809
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
but it was not needful that I see that far.

810
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I kept my horse head in the direction of movement by the crowd of Indians on horseback.

811
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I was led out and around and a far beyond the camp circle.

812
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Many hundreds of Indians on horseback were dashing to and fro in front of the soldiers.

813
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
The soldiers were on level ground.

814
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
The soldiers were on the level valley ground,

815
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and were shooting with rifles.

816
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Not many bullets were being sent back at them,

817
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
but thousands of arrows were falling among them.

818
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I went with a throng of Sue until we got beyond and behind the white men,

819
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
so you got a flank going on and they're starting to surround the white men.

820
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
By this time though, they had mounted their horses and were hiding themselves in the timber.

821
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
A band of Indians were there with the soldiers.

822
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It appeared they were crow or show-shownies.

823
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Most of the Indians had fled back up the valley,

824
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
somewhere across east of the river and were riding away over beyond the hills.

825
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
So there you go.

826
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
This is what happens.

827
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
He went, it's woken up and gets his war gear on and he's going into battle.

828
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And interestingly, he talks about there's other Indians that they're fighting.

829
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The crow's and show-shownies.

830
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It sounds like most of them are bailing.

831
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Back to the book,

832
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
our Indian crowded down toward the timber where...

833
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
one of the soldiers.

834
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
More and more of our people kept coming almost all of them were Sue.

835
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
There were only a few shians.

836
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Arrows were shoured into the timber.

837
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Bullets whistled out of the...

838
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
out toward the Sue and shians,

839
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.000
but we stayed far back while we extended our curved line further and further around the big grove trees.

840
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
So they're encircling them.

841
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Some dead soldiers had been left among the grass and sage,

842
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
but brush where they had first fought us.

843
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It seemed to me the remainder of them would not live many hours longer.

844
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Sue were creeping forward to set fire to the timber.

845
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
They're going to set fire to the woods that they're hiding in.

846
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Back to the book, suddenly,

847
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
the hidden soldiers came tearing out on horseback from the wood.

848
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I was around on that side where they came out.

849
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I wound my horse around and lasted into a dash to escape from them.

850
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
All others of my companions did the same,

851
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
but we soon discovered that they were not following us.

852
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
They were running away from us.

853
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
They were going as fast as their tired horses could carry them across the open valley space and toward the river.

854
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
We stopped, looked a moment,

855
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and then we whipped our ponies into swift pursuit.

856
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
A great thong of...

857
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
...from of Sue were also coming after them.

858
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
My distant position put me among the leaders in the chase.

859
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The soldiers' horses moved slowly as if they were tired.

860
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Rars were very lively.

861
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
We gained rapidly on them.

862
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I fired four shots with my six-shooter.

863
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I do not know whether any of my bullets did harm.

864
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I saw Sue put an arrow into the back of a soldier's head.

865
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Another arrow went down into his shoulder.

866
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
He tumbled from his horse to the ground.

867
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Others fell dead either from arrows or stabbing or jabbing from...

868
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
...or blows from...

869
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
...war clubs of the Sue.

870
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Horses limp or stat limped or staggered or sprawled out dead or dying.

871
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Our war cries and war songs were mingled with the many jering calls such as,

872
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
"...you're only boys, you ought not to be fighting.

873
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
We whipped you and rose, but you should have brought more crows or shoshones with you to do your fighting."

874
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Little bird and I were after one certain soldier.

875
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Little bird was wearing a trailing war bonnet.

876
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
He was at the right and I was at the left of the fleeing man.

877
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
We were lashing him and his horse with our pony whips.

878
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
It seemed not brave to shoot him.

879
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Besides, I did not want to waste any of my bullets.

880
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
He pointed back to his revolver.

881
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
He pointed back his revolver, though, and sent a bullet into little bird's thigh.

882
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Immediately, I whack the white man fighter on his head with a heavy, l-corn handle of my pony whip.

883
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
The blow dazed him.

884
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I seized the rifle strapped on his back.

885
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I wrenched it to the ground.

886
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I grinched it and dragged the looping strap over his head.

887
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
As I was getting possession of this weapon he felt to the ground.

888
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I did not harm him further.

889
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I do not know what became of him.

890
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
The jam of oncoming Indians swept me on.

891
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
But I now had a good soldier rifle.

892
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Yet I had not any cartridges for it.

893
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Three soldiers on horses got separated from the others and started up the valley in the direction

894
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
from where they had come.

895
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Three shions, sunbear eagle, tail feather, and little sun joined some suit and pursued in

896
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
the three white men.

897
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
The shions told afterward about the outcome of this pursuit.

898
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
One of the soldiers turned his horse eastward toward the river and escaped into the timber.

899
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The other two kept on southward.

900
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Of these two, one went off to the right up a small gulch to the top of the bench.

901
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
There he was caught and killed.

902
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
The remaining one rode on toward the mouth of Reno Creek.

903
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
As he neared that point he swore of to the right.

904
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000
He made a circle upon the valley and returned to the timber just across west from the mouth of Reno Creek.

905
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Here he dismounted from his exhausted horse and got himself into the bush.

906
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
The Sue and Shion surrounded him and killed him.

907
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000
They told that he fought bravely to his last, making use of his six-shooter.

908
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
A warbana Indian belonging with soldiers was chased by crooked nose.

909
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
The Shion and some other Sue.

910
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.000
The chase was a foot across a wet slew and into some timber northward from where the soldiers had been hidden a few minutes.

911
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000
After many exchanges of shots, after much dodging and shifting of position, the enemy Indian was killed there.

912
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Just a crazy fight.

913
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Just a crazy fight.

914
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I mean, this is like stuff that you see in western movies.

915
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
People pulling each other off a horse is shooting people in the head with bow and arrow from a horse.

916
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
That's just crazy and brutal.

917
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And I'll tell you there's some really good accounts.

918
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And I started to go down this road.

919
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:53.000
So if anybody that's listening is a student of the battle of Little Big Horn, there's, you know, lots of different stories about it.

920
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And there's also some really detailed accounts.

921
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And I started trying to pull out and match up what was happening in this account with other accounts really historically accurate documented accounts.

922
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And as I started to do that, I said, no, I'm not going to go down this road of trying to figure out exactly which situation he's talking about.

923
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
There was multiple small battles out there.

924
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:24.000
And there was like I said, Reno and Ben, Ben teen who survived with their soldiers and they made maneuvers and a lot of people blame them.

925
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Some people don't blame them.

926
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
You know, some people say that they should have gone to help.

927
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Some people say that they didn't have a chance.

928
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
There's all kinds of those things.

929
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And as I started to try and figure out which was which I said, you know what, I'm not going to go that deep into this account.

930
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
What's important about this account to me is the reality of the ground combat.

931
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
That's what that's what I'm interested in in this account.

932
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And I'm sure maybe at some point in my life when I have more time, I would love to marry up the two and say,

933
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
He must have been in this situation and this must have been this person and this must have been this maneuver.

934
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
He must have seen this maneuver from the from the cavalry.

935
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It'd be fun to do that, especially go out and walk the ground and do it.

936
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
That would be really good.

937
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But anyways, if you're a person that's fully into this, I'm not going down that road right now.

938
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
But I will go back to the book right now.

939
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Another enemy Indian was behind a little sage brush, no, and shooting as at us.

940
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
His shots were returned.

941
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I and some others went around and got behind him.

942
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
See this, I'll tell you what, wouldn't legs all about flanking people.

943
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
You notice that? He's just flanking people all over the place.

944
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I and some others went around and got behind him.

945
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
We dismounted him.

946
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
We dismounted and crept toward him.

947
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
As we came close upon up to him, he fell, a bull in it hit him.

948
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
He raised himself up, though, and swung his rifle around toward us.

949
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
We rushed upon him.

950
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I crashed a blow of my rifle barrel upon his head.

951
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Others beat and stabbed him to death.

952
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I also got his gun.

953
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It was the same as the one I had taken from the other soldier, but the Indians gun had a longer barrel.

954
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
One of the Sue scout the dead man.

955
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Different ones took his clothing.

956
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I took nothing except the gun.

957
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Continuing on, somebody said to me, look, yonder, other soldiers.

958
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I saw them on a distant hill down the river and on our same side of it.

959
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
The news of them spread quickly among us Indians began to ride in that direction.

960
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
They're now going to again, this is where I didn't want to try and figure out exactly what

961
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
battle, but yeah.

962
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
There's another portion of the battle taking place.

963
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I know in my head where he's going, but we'll just say there's he sees other soldiers to go after.

964
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I'm pretty sure this is him going after custer.

965
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:59.000
As he's going towards this other battle with taking place, he passes through the camp again.

966
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Then he sees his dad and he says, my father was the only person at our lodge.

967
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I told him of the fight up in the valley.

968
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I told him of having helped in the killing of the enemy Indian and some soldiers in the river.

969
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I gave to him the tobacco I had taken.

970
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I showed him my gun and all the cartridges.

971
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You have been brave, he chured me.

972
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
You've done enough for the day.

973
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Now you should rest.

974
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
No.

975
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I want to go and fight the other soldiers.

976
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I can fight better now with this gun.

977
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Your horse is tired, he argued.

978
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Yes, but I want to ride the other one.

979
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
So wouldn't leg.

980
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
He had a good morning so far.

981
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
God after it.

982
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:45.000
But he sees a fight going on and because he's a warrior, he says, no, I'm getting back in the game.

983
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Back to the book.

984
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
As we approach the place of battle, each one chose his own personal course.

985
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
All the Indians had come out on horseback, almost all of them dismounted and crept along the gullies of

986
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
foot after the arrival near the soldiers.

987
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I think that's the reason I highlighted that is because you got people doing decentralized

988
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
command.

989
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Oh, you see where the battle is?

990
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Get there.

991
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Right?

992
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
We don't have to line up.

993
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
We don't have to march together.

994
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You see where the battle is?

995
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Get there on your own personal course.

996
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Make it happen.

997
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Most of the Indians were working around the ridge now occupied by the soldiers.

998
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
We're laying down in gullies and behind sage, brush hill locks.

999
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.20
The shooting at first was at a distance, but we kept creeping in closer all around the

1000
01:14:32.20 --> 01:14:33.20
ridge.

1001
01:14:33.20 --> 01:14:36.40
Boes and arrows were used more than guns.

1002
01:14:36.40 --> 01:14:42.000
From the hiding places of the Indians, the arrows could be shot high and long curve to

1003
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
fall upon the soldiers or their horses.

1004
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And Indian using a gun had to jump on up and expose himself, long to shoot.

1005
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.60
The arrows falling upon the horses stuck in their backs and caused them to go plunging here

1006
01:14:56.60 --> 01:14:59.000
and there knocking down the soldier.

1007
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.24
This is classic.

1008
01:15:00.24 --> 01:15:05.68
You think that the rifle is the better weapon, but the rifle you have to expose yourself

1009
01:15:05.68 --> 01:15:06.68
to shoot.

1010
01:15:06.68 --> 01:15:13.40
Well, the Indians are just honkered down behind a knoll or behind some brush or behind a valley

1011
01:15:13.40 --> 01:15:16.40
and they're just lobbying like a mortar rounds.

1012
01:15:16.40 --> 01:15:20.000
Thousands of mortar rounds just hitting into where the soldiers are and the soldiers can't

1013
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.40
do anything to them.

1014
01:15:26.40 --> 01:15:30.60
The long distance fighting was kept up for about an hour and a half, I believe.

1015
01:15:30.60 --> 01:15:37.32
The Indians all the time could see where the soldiers were because the white men were mostly

1016
01:15:37.32 --> 01:15:42.16
on a ridge and their horses were with them, but the soldiers could not see our warriors.

1017
01:15:42.16 --> 01:15:46.12
As they had left their ponies and were crawling through the gullies in the sagebrush,

1018
01:15:46.12 --> 01:15:52.52
warrior were jump up, shoot, jerk himself down quickly and then crawl a little forward.

1019
01:15:52.52 --> 01:15:53.52
A little further forward.

1020
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:58.44
All around the soldier ridge are men were doing this, so not many of them got hit by soldier

1021
01:15:58.44 --> 01:15:59.80
bullets during this time of fighting.

1022
01:15:59.80 --> 01:16:01.44
This is beautiful.

1023
01:16:01.44 --> 01:16:02.44
This is beautiful.

1024
01:16:02.44 --> 01:16:07.12
This is exactly what we teach, what the military teaches.

1025
01:16:07.12 --> 01:16:08.12
Individual movement.

1026
01:16:08.12 --> 01:16:11.44
You shoot, you get up, you get back down, you crawl, you get up again.

1027
01:16:11.44 --> 01:16:13.08
So the enemy might see you.

1028
01:16:13.08 --> 01:16:16.48
Right, when you take a shot, then you duck and then when you pop up again, you're not

1029
01:16:16.48 --> 01:16:17.48
in the same place.

1030
01:16:17.48 --> 01:16:19.68
So if you were aiming where they were, they're not there anymore.

1031
01:16:19.68 --> 01:16:23.04
This is this is beautiful tactics.

1032
01:16:23.04 --> 01:16:27.08
In a few minutes, the warriors were all around these soldiers.

1033
01:16:27.08 --> 01:16:30.20
Then lame man, lame white man, this is an Indian.

1034
01:16:30.20 --> 01:16:33.16
Lame white man called out, come.

1035
01:16:33.16 --> 01:16:39.12
We can kill all of them all around the Indians, begin jumping up, running forward, dodging

1036
01:16:39.12 --> 01:16:44.04
down, jumping up again, down again, all the time towards the soldiers.

1037
01:16:44.04 --> 01:16:47.16
Right away, all the white men went crazy.

1038
01:16:47.16 --> 01:16:51.44
Instead of fighting us, they turned their guns upon themselves.

1039
01:16:51.44 --> 01:16:54.24
Almost before we could get to them, every one of them was dead.

1040
01:16:54.24 --> 01:16:57.84
They killed themselves.

1041
01:16:57.84 --> 01:17:02.36
The Indians took the guns of these soldiers and used them for shooting at the soldiers

1042
01:17:02.36 --> 01:17:03.68
on the high ridge.

1043
01:17:03.68 --> 01:17:10.12
I went back and got my horse and rode around beyond the east end of the ridge.

1044
01:17:10.12 --> 01:17:14.24
By the time I got there, all the soldiers were dead.

1045
01:17:14.24 --> 01:17:18.80
The Indians told me they'd killed only a few of those men and that the men had shot

1046
01:17:18.80 --> 01:17:20.28
each other and shot themselves.

1047
01:17:20.28 --> 01:17:27.12
And this is very controversial, whether these guys killed themselves.

1048
01:17:27.12 --> 01:17:28.52
And I don't even know if it's that controversial.

1049
01:17:28.52 --> 01:17:32.48
It's like straight up, most people don't believe that.

1050
01:17:32.48 --> 01:17:33.48
I don't know.

1051
01:17:33.48 --> 01:17:36.84
I don't know what the answer is.

1052
01:17:36.84 --> 01:17:43.48
But we know that one thing we do know, they're all dead.

1053
01:17:43.48 --> 01:17:44.92
Back to the book.

1054
01:17:44.92 --> 01:17:47.20
I saw one sue walking, and I'm sure you know what?

1055
01:17:47.20 --> 01:17:51.36
I'm sure that somebody that's listening to this is going to give us the full report.

1056
01:17:51.36 --> 01:17:52.36
Yeah.

1057
01:17:52.36 --> 01:17:53.52
And actually, I have books.

1058
01:17:53.52 --> 01:17:58.08
I have books and this is not this is not the same account, right?

1059
01:17:58.08 --> 01:18:00.04
This is different than killing themselves.

1060
01:18:00.04 --> 01:18:03.76
So I know that, but well, I'm talking about this book right now.

1061
01:18:03.76 --> 01:18:05.64
So I'm going with it.

1062
01:18:05.64 --> 01:18:12.36
I saw one sue walking slowly toward the gulch going away from where were the soldiers.

1063
01:18:12.36 --> 01:18:14.44
He wobbled easily as he moved along.

1064
01:18:14.44 --> 01:18:19.36
He fell down, got up, fell down, got up again.

1065
01:18:19.36 --> 01:18:26.24
As he passed near to where I was, I saw that his whole lower jaw was shot away.

1066
01:18:26.24 --> 01:18:30.48
The sight of him made me sick. I had to vomit.

1067
01:18:30.48 --> 01:18:37.04
I did not know him, and I did not learn whether he died or not.

1068
01:18:37.04 --> 01:18:40.04
The shots quit coming from the soldiers.

1069
01:18:40.04 --> 01:18:45.68
Warriors who had crepts, close to them, began to call out that all the white men were dead.

1070
01:18:45.68 --> 01:18:50.28
All the Indians then jumped up and rushed forward, all the boys and the old men on

1071
01:18:50.28 --> 01:18:52.68
their horses came tearing into the crowd.

1072
01:18:52.68 --> 01:18:55.60
The air was full of smoke and dust.

1073
01:18:55.60 --> 01:18:57.04
Nobody was greatly excited.

1074
01:18:57.04 --> 01:19:02.88
It looked like thousands of dogs might look if they were mixed together in a fight.

1075
01:19:02.88 --> 01:19:07.000
All of the Indians were saying that these soldiers went so crazy they killed themselves.

1076
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.32
I do not know.

1077
01:19:08.32 --> 01:19:12.000
I could not see them, but I believe they did so.

1078
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.60
Again, so he doesn't even know what the real deal is there.

1079
01:19:14.60 --> 01:19:19.44
But like I said, what we do know is that not one of them lived.

1080
01:19:19.44 --> 01:19:22.04
I took one scalp.

1081
01:19:22.04 --> 01:19:26.48
As I went walking and leading my horse among the dead, I observed one face that interested

1082
01:19:26.48 --> 01:19:27.48
me.

1083
01:19:27.48 --> 01:19:32.04
The dead man had a long beard growing from both sides of his face and extending several

1084
01:19:32.04 --> 01:19:33.60
inches below the chin.

1085
01:19:33.60 --> 01:19:36.76
He also had a full mustache.

1086
01:19:36.76 --> 01:19:42.04
All of the beard hair was of a light yellow color, as I now recall it.

1087
01:19:42.04 --> 01:19:46.68
Most of the soldiers had beard growing in different lengths, but this was the longest one

1088
01:19:46.68 --> 01:19:48.16
I saw among them.

1089
01:19:48.16 --> 01:19:52.32
I think the dead man may have been 30 or more years old.

1090
01:19:52.32 --> 01:19:53.56
Here is a new kind of scalp.

1091
01:19:53.56 --> 01:19:59.08
I said to a companion, I skinned one side of the face and half of the chin so I was to keep

1092
01:19:59.08 --> 01:20:03.04
the long beard yet on the part removed.

1093
01:20:03.04 --> 01:20:07.16
I got an arrow shaft and tied the strange scalp to the end of it.

1094
01:20:07.16 --> 01:20:11.60
This I carried in hand, as I went looking further.

1095
01:20:11.60 --> 01:20:14.92
Somebody told me noisy walking was badly wounded.

1096
01:20:14.92 --> 01:20:17.16
That was another Indian named noisy walking.

1097
01:20:17.16 --> 01:20:22.76
I went to where he was said to be down in the gulch where the band of soldiers near us

1098
01:20:22.76 --> 01:20:26.76
the river had been killed in the earlier part of the battle.

1099
01:20:26.76 --> 01:20:34.000
He was my same age and often we had been companions since our small boyhood.

1100
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.44
White bull and important medicine man was his father.

1101
01:20:38.44 --> 01:20:43.36
Noisy walking had been hit by three different bullets.

1102
01:20:43.36 --> 01:20:45.80
One of them having passed through his body.

1103
01:20:45.80 --> 01:20:49.44
He also had some stab wounds in his side.

1104
01:20:49.44 --> 01:20:53.40
I asked the young man, how are you?

1105
01:20:53.40 --> 01:20:57.32
He replied, good.

1106
01:20:57.32 --> 01:21:00.12
But he did not look well.

1107
01:21:00.12 --> 01:21:06.12
One young shion took something from a dead soldier just after all of them had been killed.

1108
01:21:06.12 --> 01:21:08.12
He was puzzled by it.

1109
01:21:08.12 --> 01:21:09.40
Some others looked at it.

1110
01:21:09.40 --> 01:21:11.28
I was with them.

1111
01:21:11.28 --> 01:21:14.96
It was made of white metal and had glass on one side.

1112
01:21:14.96 --> 01:21:17.12
On this side were marks of some kind.

1113
01:21:17.12 --> 01:21:22.32
While the shion was looking at it, he got it up towards his ear.

1114
01:21:22.32 --> 01:21:23.52
Then he put it up close.

1115
01:21:23.52 --> 01:21:26.24
It's alive, he said.

1116
01:21:26.24 --> 01:21:28.16
Others put it to their ears and listened.

1117
01:21:28.16 --> 01:21:29.56
I put it to mind.

1118
01:21:29.56 --> 01:21:31.84
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

1119
01:21:31.84 --> 01:21:33.20
It was saying.

1120
01:21:33.20 --> 01:21:34.20
We talked about it's use.

1121
01:21:34.20 --> 01:21:38.08
We generally agreed that it was a soldier's special medicine.

1122
01:21:38.08 --> 01:21:40.84
Many Indians came and wondered about it.

1123
01:21:40.84 --> 01:21:43.72
The young man decided to keep it for his own medicine.

1124
01:21:43.72 --> 01:21:47.16
They found a watch on one of the soldiers, a little wind up pocket watch.

1125
01:21:47.16 --> 01:21:53.72
To me, this was just a really good example of the cultural differences they had never

1126
01:21:53.72 --> 01:21:56.08
seen a watch before.

1127
01:21:56.08 --> 01:22:00.64
They were surprised and demon-understanding what it was or that it was not actually alive.

1128
01:22:00.64 --> 01:22:05.44
It was just a mechanical watch.

1129
01:22:05.44 --> 01:22:10.16
Back to the book, Noisy Walking died during the night after the great battle.

1130
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:13.68
The shions had been killed.

1131
01:22:13.68 --> 01:22:16.28
The man opened belly was badly wounded and was expected to die.

1132
01:22:16.28 --> 01:22:20.60
He was about 30 years old but he had neither wife nor children.

1133
01:22:20.60 --> 01:22:29.08
The six dead were lame white man, limber bones, black bear, noisy barking, hump nose,

1134
01:22:29.08 --> 01:22:37.44
when whirlwind.

1135
01:22:37.44 --> 01:22:41.92
Then after that battle, during the afternoon it was learned that yet another band of white

1136
01:22:41.92 --> 01:22:44.48
men were coming up, the little big horn valley.

1137
01:22:44.48 --> 01:22:47.04
All the young men wanted to fight.

1138
01:22:47.04 --> 01:22:49.04
A council of chiefs was held.

1139
01:22:49.04 --> 01:22:53.000
They decided we should continue in our same course and not fight any soldiers if we could

1140
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.48
get away without doing so.

1141
01:22:55.48 --> 01:22:58.32
All of the Indians then got ready to move.

1142
01:22:58.32 --> 01:23:06.40
Probably a smart move.

1143
01:23:06.40 --> 01:23:13.000
So then after that they go to this area, that's called greasy grass.

1144
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.12
And there they have a little war dance, a little sort of a, I guess you'd call it a ceremony

1145
01:23:19.12 --> 01:23:21.68
or a celebration.

1146
01:23:21.68 --> 01:23:25.24
Back to the book, charcoal bear, our medicine chief brought the buffalo skin from the

1147
01:23:25.24 --> 01:23:29.08
sacred T.P. and put it on top of a pole of the center of our camp circle.

1148
01:23:29.08 --> 01:23:32.76
We danced around this pole, no women took part in the dancing.

1149
01:23:32.76 --> 01:23:38.16
Many of them had sore legs from morning cuts and when they lose their husband, they would

1150
01:23:38.16 --> 01:23:40.44
cut themselves.

1151
01:23:40.44 --> 01:23:43.24
Our dance was not carried very far into the night.

1152
01:23:43.24 --> 01:23:47.88
It was mostly a short telling of experiencing, accounting of coup.

1153
01:23:47.88 --> 01:23:53.04
My father told, in a few words, what his two sons had done.

1154
01:23:53.04 --> 01:23:59.20
When he ended the telling of my warrior Axe said, the name of this son of mine is wooden

1155
01:23:59.20 --> 01:24:01.40
leg.

1156
01:24:01.40 --> 01:24:07.32
To this time, people had still used my boyhood name, eats from his hand.

1157
01:24:07.32 --> 01:24:12.08
But now this old name was entirely gone.

1158
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:23.16
So after that battle a bit, little big horn is when wooden leg became wooden leg.

1159
01:24:23.16 --> 01:24:33.04
Now they proceed and together all this big mass of tribes.

1160
01:24:33.04 --> 01:24:37.60
About to separate their tribes and start going in their own directions and then they

1161
01:24:37.60 --> 01:24:38.60
get a report.

1162
01:24:38.60 --> 01:24:40.16
Soldiers are coming.

1163
01:24:40.16 --> 01:24:42.80
The two bands of Indians began to come together again.

1164
01:24:42.80 --> 01:24:46.44
The warriors mingled themselves as being one tribe.

1165
01:24:46.44 --> 01:24:51.04
The women and children and older men, both of both sets of people, moved together up the

1166
01:24:51.04 --> 01:24:52.04
tongue river.

1167
01:24:52.04 --> 01:24:54.80
The young men put themselves behind their fleeing people.

1168
01:24:54.80 --> 01:24:58.24
Somebody said to me, they have captured some women.

1169
01:24:58.24 --> 01:25:00.44
Your sister is one of them.

1170
01:25:00.44 --> 01:25:02.64
My heart jumped when this news came to me.

1171
01:25:02.64 --> 01:25:08.64
I lashed my horse into a run toward where it was said they had been captured.

1172
01:25:08.64 --> 01:25:11.24
There I saw the tracks of soldier horses.

1173
01:25:11.24 --> 01:25:14.20
The trail led me to the river of ice.

1174
01:25:14.20 --> 01:25:17.08
On the opposite side of the river, the west side were soldiers.

1175
01:25:17.08 --> 01:25:18.48
They began shooting at me.

1176
01:25:18.48 --> 01:25:24.08
I had to get away. I did not see any of the women so I suppose they had been killed.

1177
01:25:24.08 --> 01:25:28.76
My heart then became bitter toward these white men.

1178
01:25:28.76 --> 01:25:34.60
I hid my horse in the brush at the foot of the ridge where some warriors were on its top.

1179
01:25:34.60 --> 01:25:35.88
I walked up there.

1180
01:25:35.88 --> 01:25:39.20
Many Indians were hidden behind rocks and were shooting towards the soldiers.

1181
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:42.24
I chose for myself a place of hiding and did the same.

1182
01:25:42.24 --> 01:25:44.96
I had my soldier rifle and plenty of cartridges.

1183
01:25:44.96 --> 01:25:49.52
Many soldiers were coming across the ice to fight us but we had the advantage because

1184
01:25:49.52 --> 01:25:56.72
our position was high and on a rocky ridge.

1185
01:25:56.72 --> 01:26:02.04
It's interesting that he doesn't even become bitter towards the soldiers until they do something

1186
01:26:02.04 --> 01:26:06.04
to his sister and then all of a sudden he's bitter towards the white men.

1187
01:26:06.04 --> 01:26:07.52
It's also important there at the end.

1188
01:26:07.52 --> 01:26:09.52
You got to get the high ground.

1189
01:26:09.52 --> 01:26:10.52
You got to get the high ground.

1190
01:26:10.52 --> 01:26:12.52
That's literally the only reason that I put that in there.

1191
01:26:12.52 --> 01:26:18.56
It's for a tie for those of you out there that are in the military that are fighting.

1192
01:26:18.56 --> 01:26:19.56
Get the high ground.

1193
01:26:19.56 --> 01:26:24.44
It gives you a massive advantage over the enemy.

1194
01:26:24.44 --> 01:26:33.32
So after this they kind of settle up the tongue river and there I'll go back to book

1195
01:26:33.32 --> 01:26:34.84
we found plenty of buffalo there.

1196
01:26:34.84 --> 01:26:38.08
We went on west to the upper little big horn.

1197
01:26:38.08 --> 01:26:41.88
After camping and hunting there we went farther to the big horn at the mouth of rotten

1198
01:26:41.88 --> 01:26:43.44
grass creek.

1199
01:26:43.44 --> 01:26:44.64
We did not stay there long.

1200
01:26:44.64 --> 01:26:46.52
We returned a little big horn.

1201
01:26:46.52 --> 01:26:50.04
Most of the last part of winter was spent in a camp in this valley.

1202
01:26:50.04 --> 01:26:53.04
All the time during the next few months we had good hunting.

1203
01:26:53.04 --> 01:26:55.20
Soldiers did not trouble us.

1204
01:26:55.20 --> 01:26:57.28
Nor did we trouble them.

1205
01:26:57.28 --> 01:26:59.12
All the people had good lodges.

1206
01:26:59.12 --> 01:27:03.60
In every way we were living yet according to our customary habits.

1207
01:27:03.60 --> 01:27:05.56
We were not bothering any white people.

1208
01:27:05.56 --> 01:27:07.68
We did not want to see any of them.

1209
01:27:07.68 --> 01:27:09.76
We felt we were on our land.

1210
01:27:09.76 --> 01:27:15.64
We had killed only such people as had come for driving us away from it.

1211
01:27:15.64 --> 01:27:21.44
So our hearts were clean from any feeling of guilt.

1212
01:27:21.44 --> 01:27:22.44
So they're kind of living.

1213
01:27:22.44 --> 01:27:27.40
They're kind of going back to just living their own, the way that they were used to living.

1214
01:27:27.40 --> 01:27:37.16
This is where this next chapter, chapter 7 is called the surrender of the shiands.

1215
01:27:37.16 --> 01:27:41.04
Just before the grass began to show itself in the early part of spring, two visitors

1216
01:27:41.04 --> 01:27:44.28
arrived at our camp on Little Big Horn.

1217
01:27:44.28 --> 01:27:50.28
One of these was our old captured old woman, sweet woman.

1218
01:27:50.28 --> 01:27:53.56
The other was a half-breed suit we called white.

1219
01:27:53.56 --> 01:27:59.92
Each had a horse to ride and each was leading a pack horse in their packs were tobacco

1220
01:27:59.92 --> 01:28:03.80
and other things for gifts to the principal chiefs.

1221
01:28:03.80 --> 01:28:07.44
The visitors said they've been sent out from the soldier fort at the mouth of the tongue

1222
01:28:07.44 --> 01:28:11.24
river to invite us to come there and surrender peaceably.

1223
01:28:11.24 --> 01:28:15.48
They brought us a promise from Bearcoat, the soldier chief there, that we should not be

1224
01:28:15.48 --> 01:28:19.64
harmed and should be given plenty of food.

1225
01:28:19.64 --> 01:28:22.24
So we're starting to get enticed.

1226
01:28:22.24 --> 01:28:30.84
We're starting to get enticed by some, you know, basically food tobacco.

1227
01:28:30.84 --> 01:28:34.36
The book, the four chiefs came back to us at this powder river camp.

1228
01:28:34.36 --> 01:28:35.48
White bowl was not with them.

1229
01:28:35.48 --> 01:28:40.12
They told us he had stayed with the soldiers to scout for them in hunting Indians.

1230
01:28:40.12 --> 01:28:42.28
This news did not please us.

1231
01:28:42.28 --> 01:28:46.76
As we looked at it, the surrendering to the soldiers was good if one felt like doing this,

1232
01:28:46.76 --> 01:28:51.68
but it offered to help them to kill friends, showed a bad heart.

1233
01:28:51.68 --> 01:28:55.000
I was more affected though by other news, the chiefs brought.

1234
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.36
It was concerning my sister, Crooked Knows, one of the captives.

1235
01:28:59.36 --> 01:29:04.44
The chiefs were only a part of the first day out and coming back from the fort.

1236
01:29:04.44 --> 01:29:08.08
Somebody followed them to tell them about her.

1237
01:29:08.08 --> 01:29:13.44
She had been very sad and the heart because of a belief she would never see her people.

1238
01:29:13.44 --> 01:29:18.04
She had felt better when the chiefs came, but when they went away again, she fell into

1239
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:20.04
a deep grief.

1240
01:29:20.04 --> 01:29:22.20
My sorrow was so great.

1241
01:29:22.20 --> 01:29:26.48
Her sorrow was so great that she had gotten out her hidden sick shooter.

1242
01:29:26.48 --> 01:29:30.60
I had given to her and she sought herself dead.

1243
01:29:30.60 --> 01:29:34.56
My heart almost stopped beating when I heard about her death this way.

1244
01:29:34.56 --> 01:29:39.88
She had been a good sister kind to everybody.

1245
01:29:39.88 --> 01:29:45.92
Seven shions from the agency came to the camp on powder river.

1246
01:29:45.92 --> 01:29:46.72
One of them had a T.P.

1247
01:29:46.72 --> 01:29:49.48
Lodge, but no women were with them.

1248
01:29:49.48 --> 01:29:53.96
They came only to tell us we ought to surrender at the agency.

1249
01:29:53.96 --> 01:29:58.68
They said all the Indians there were being well fed, well treated in every way.

1250
01:29:58.68 --> 01:30:05.000
Nobody was being punished in any manner for past conduct and warfare against the soldiers.

1251
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.48
So they're getting told basically.

1252
01:30:06.48 --> 01:30:07.48
There's another group.

1253
01:30:07.48 --> 01:30:09.28
There's the concern right at the fort.

1254
01:30:09.28 --> 01:30:15.44
The army fort or the concern at the Indian agency, which is also controlled by the soldiers.

1255
01:30:15.44 --> 01:30:22.72
And of course, I just read that part about what in leg sister committing suicide.

1256
01:30:22.72 --> 01:30:29.32
So just a devastating blow to him.

1257
01:30:29.32 --> 01:30:37.12
Now as this continues, the decision gets made by the chiefs to surrender.

1258
01:30:37.12 --> 01:30:40.32
Actually at first to find out a little bit more gather some more until.

1259
01:30:40.32 --> 01:30:45.04
Sorry, little wolf and the other principal chiefs chose to go out to the agency.

1260
01:30:45.04 --> 01:30:55.48
And then when they come back, they say that it's pretty good to go.

1261
01:30:55.48 --> 01:31:00.24
And when they hear this, they hear about the food, they hear about the whiskey, they hear

1262
01:31:00.24 --> 01:31:08.60
about the shelter, they decide that the main body of the tribe sets off towards the agency

1263
01:31:08.60 --> 01:31:12.08
to surrender.

1264
01:31:12.08 --> 01:31:16.44
Back to the book, but not all the shions were ready yet to surrender at any place.

1265
01:31:16.44 --> 01:31:22.04
14 or 15 men, six or seven of them having wives or children separated off to go westward.

1266
01:31:22.04 --> 01:31:25.92
White hawk, a little chief of the elk warriors, was with them.

1267
01:31:25.92 --> 01:31:31.04
I joined another band still desiring the most freedom we considered to be ours by right.

1268
01:31:31.04 --> 01:31:33.04
34 shions made up this band.

1269
01:31:33.04 --> 01:31:36.000
So there's a couple of separate groups that break off and decide they're going to continue

1270
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
pushing.

1271
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.80
And as they're doing that when they get in these smaller groups, if you can imagine, I mean,

1272
01:31:43.80 --> 01:31:48.56
just like any group, if you break it down enough, you start to lose your efficiency.

1273
01:31:48.56 --> 01:31:50.12
And that's what happened with these smaller groups.

1274
01:31:50.12 --> 01:31:53.08
They just weren't as efficient anymore because they had less people.

1275
01:31:53.08 --> 01:31:54.96
I mean, you can't catch as many.

1276
01:31:54.96 --> 01:31:58.64
You can't work in cooperation to hunt buffalo.

1277
01:31:58.64 --> 01:32:04.12
And so they didn't do well on their own.

1278
01:32:04.12 --> 01:32:07.68
Back to the book, we were having a good many days of hunger.

1279
01:32:07.68 --> 01:32:12.84
Our horses had plenty of grass, but our own ribs were becoming thin.

1280
01:32:12.84 --> 01:32:18.40
Our clothing was wearing out and we could knock it enough skins to renew them and keep our

1281
01:32:18.40 --> 01:32:21.84
beds and our lodges in good order.

1282
01:32:21.84 --> 01:32:24.36
My soldier coat and breaches were gone.

1283
01:32:24.36 --> 01:32:29.08
And my last shirt and cough breaches were almost in tatters.

1284
01:32:29.08 --> 01:32:32.16
The only good article of where I had now was my big white hat.

1285
01:32:32.16 --> 01:32:35.04
I had captured at the Rosebud Battle.

1286
01:32:35.04 --> 01:32:40.000
The Cheyenne named Yellow Eagle added himself to us.

1287
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.60
He had been at the agency not before, not long before.

1288
01:32:44.60 --> 01:32:49.84
We decided to have him and white bird go there and spy out the conditions.

1289
01:32:49.84 --> 01:32:53.56
They went in a week or so.

1290
01:32:53.56 --> 01:32:55.84
They were back among us.

1291
01:32:55.84 --> 01:33:00.64
Good treatment, plenty of food, blankets, everything.

1292
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:01.80
Nobody punished.

1293
01:33:01.80 --> 01:33:03.92
They reported.

1294
01:33:03.92 --> 01:33:09.72
They started right away for the agency.

1295
01:33:09.72 --> 01:33:18.04
So when they split apart into these smaller groups, that was definitely problematic.

1296
01:33:18.04 --> 01:33:25.08
And now they go from being out there, kind of on their own, hungry, running out of food.

1297
01:33:25.08 --> 01:33:27.60
Don't have to quit many more.

1298
01:33:27.60 --> 01:33:31.68
And they send somebody to the agency to check it out and they get the report back.

1299
01:33:31.68 --> 01:33:34.72
But there's plenty of food and blankets in the warm.

1300
01:33:34.72 --> 01:33:38.28
And all they're going to do there is go ahead and give up.

1301
01:33:38.28 --> 01:33:45.28
So now they move and they start heading towards the agency.

1302
01:33:45.28 --> 01:33:49.80
And when they get there, back the book, it made us all feel good to see hundreds of the

1303
01:33:49.80 --> 01:33:53.44
Indian lodges as we came near to the agency.

1304
01:33:53.44 --> 01:33:54.44
We galloped.

1305
01:33:54.44 --> 01:33:55.44
Our horses forward.

1306
01:33:55.44 --> 01:33:57.80
We cheered and fired gunshots into the air.

1307
01:33:57.80 --> 01:33:59.72
Some soldiers came running out of their tents.

1308
01:33:59.72 --> 01:34:06.60
But they soon saw we were friendly and only celebrating and notifying our people we had come.

1309
01:34:06.60 --> 01:34:08.96
So here they are.

1310
01:34:08.96 --> 01:34:14.72
And a white man, Mary 2 Cheyenne woman, was acting as an interpreter for the soldiers.

1311
01:34:14.72 --> 01:34:16.28
His name was Roland.

1312
01:34:16.28 --> 01:34:19.48
But white hat did not need any interpreter in talking to us.

1313
01:34:19.48 --> 01:34:22.52
He could make the sign talk so well.

1314
01:34:22.52 --> 01:34:28.52
After the general handshaking, white hat said, now you men must give me your guns and

1315
01:34:28.52 --> 01:34:30.88
your horses.

1316
01:34:30.88 --> 01:34:40.32
We were not expecting this, but we trusted him so we began to do as he asked.

1317
01:34:40.32 --> 01:34:42.68
I'm telling you got to be careful in the situation.

1318
01:34:42.68 --> 01:34:48.12
When you start giving up your guns, this is not a recommended course of action.

1319
01:34:48.12 --> 01:34:53.36
You know, if you're coming in peace, why are you not allowed to keep your weapons?

1320
01:34:53.36 --> 01:34:58.48
This is not a, I did not agree with this scenario.

1321
01:34:58.48 --> 01:35:01.72
Back to the book.

1322
01:35:01.72 --> 01:35:08.44
We had one big chief standing elk who kept saying it would be better if we should go there.

1323
01:35:08.44 --> 01:35:11.52
So they're trying to get them to push towards the south.

1324
01:35:11.52 --> 01:35:16.32
Like towards Oklahoma would be Oklahoma and they're kind of against it.

1325
01:35:16.32 --> 01:35:19.80
They don't want to walk anymore and they feel like they hey look, we came here.

1326
01:35:19.80 --> 01:35:21.80
We were supposed to be here.

1327
01:35:21.80 --> 01:35:25.40
They're saying oh no, we're going to move you guys south.

1328
01:35:25.40 --> 01:35:27.28
And they're all saying no, we don't want to.

1329
01:35:27.28 --> 01:35:28.84
So that's what standing elk is talked about.

1330
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:32.60
So standing elk who kept saying it would be better if we should go there.

1331
01:35:32.60 --> 01:35:37.52
I think there were not as many as 10 shians and a whole tribe who agreed with him.

1332
01:35:37.52 --> 01:35:41.80
There was a feeling that he was talking this way only to make himself a big Indian among

1333
01:35:41.80 --> 01:35:43.84
the white people.

1334
01:35:43.84 --> 01:35:50.52
The white men chiefs would not talk much to any shian chief, but him.

1335
01:35:50.52 --> 01:35:55.56
They gave him extra presence and treated him as if he were the only tribe, the only chief

1336
01:35:55.56 --> 01:36:01.40
in the tribe, but he was, but one of our 40 tribal big chiefs.

1337
01:36:01.40 --> 01:36:04.80
One day he went about telling everybody, all right, get ready to move.

1338
01:36:04.80 --> 01:36:08.20
The soldiers are going to take us from here tomorrow.

1339
01:36:08.20 --> 01:36:10.36
Lots of shianans were angry.

1340
01:36:10.36 --> 01:36:15.24
We'd understood that when we surrendered, we would live on our same white river reservation.

1341
01:36:15.24 --> 01:36:21.000
We'd given up our guns and our horses and a quit fighting because of this promise.

1342
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.04
Now, after we had put ourselves at this great disadvantage, the promise was to be broken.

1343
01:36:28.04 --> 01:36:31.80
But we could not do anything except they'll bathe him.

1344
01:36:31.80 --> 01:36:37.000
So three sleeps after my small band had come to what we thought was to be our home.

1345
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.88
The whole tribe was on its way to what we now call Oklahoma.

1346
01:36:43.88 --> 01:36:50.52
So again, that's why we don't give up our guns.

1347
01:36:50.52 --> 01:36:54.36
You give up your guns, you give up your strength, you give up your leverage, give up your

1348
01:36:54.36 --> 01:36:58.04
ability to fight.

1349
01:36:58.04 --> 01:37:01.92
The soldier leader of our movement to the south was known as tall white man.

1350
01:37:01.92 --> 01:37:04.28
He was a good man, always kind to the Indians.

1351
01:37:04.28 --> 01:37:08.76
We had to do whatever he said we must do, but he talked good to our chiefs.

1352
01:37:08.76 --> 01:37:12.52
So all of us were pleased to have him guiding us.

1353
01:37:12.52 --> 01:37:14.56
He had with him a band of soldiers.

1354
01:37:14.56 --> 01:37:19.48
I do not know how many, but I think there may have been almost 100 of them.

1355
01:37:19.48 --> 01:37:23.72
Our horses that have been taken away from us at the agency were returned to us.

1356
01:37:23.72 --> 01:37:26.16
Still many shions did not own any.

1357
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:31.000
Old people who had no animal to ride were provided with them from the soldier heard.

1358
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Or very older sick people were allowed to ride in the soldier wagons.

1359
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.40
Young men who owned no horses had to walk or borrow from friends.

1360
01:37:39.40 --> 01:37:40.80
I owned four.

1361
01:37:40.80 --> 01:37:44.68
I had three of them, blown out, most of the time.

1362
01:37:44.68 --> 01:37:53.24
So that's actually the treatment at this point by tall white man was fairly good.

1363
01:37:53.24 --> 01:37:58.32
It sounds like they kind of got along with the soldiers at this point.

1364
01:37:58.32 --> 01:37:59.32
Here's an example of that.

1365
01:37:59.32 --> 01:38:01.08
Soldiers hunted with the Indians.

1366
01:38:01.08 --> 01:38:03.20
All the soldiers were friendly and good to us.

1367
01:38:03.20 --> 01:38:05.60
They were good shooters and they killed lots of game.

1368
01:38:05.60 --> 01:38:07.12
They gave us most of the meat.

1369
01:38:07.12 --> 01:38:10.36
I became specifically friendly with two or three of them.

1370
01:38:10.36 --> 01:38:13.64
I like to be with them and they appeared to like me.

1371
01:38:13.64 --> 01:38:17.28
I went at times to their camp and the evening and visited with them.

1372
01:38:17.28 --> 01:38:21.36
When we were about halfway along and our journey asked one of them, let me take your gun tomorrow.

1373
01:38:21.36 --> 01:38:23.60
Yes, you may take it until late.

1374
01:38:23.60 --> 01:38:28.32
So I think the reason I wanted to bring that up is when you get soldiers and warriors and

1375
01:38:28.32 --> 01:38:30.16
you put them together and you get rid of the politics.

1376
01:38:30.16 --> 01:38:31.16
Guess what?

1377
01:38:31.16 --> 01:38:32.16
They get along.

1378
01:38:32.16 --> 01:38:33.16
We like shooting.

1379
01:38:33.16 --> 01:38:34.16
We like hunting.

1380
01:38:34.16 --> 01:38:35.16
We're warriors.

1381
01:38:35.16 --> 01:38:36.16
We're going to get along.

1382
01:38:36.16 --> 01:38:39.52
Kind of like the Germans playing the playing soccer.

1383
01:38:39.52 --> 01:38:44.52
And soccer, exactly.

1384
01:38:44.52 --> 01:38:48.76
Maybe a glass of scotch and collet.

1385
01:38:48.76 --> 01:38:55.84
Now when they get down to Oklahoma, they settle in in the south.

1386
01:38:55.84 --> 01:38:56.84
Here we go back to the book.

1387
01:38:56.84 --> 01:38:59.28
I learned in the south of Whiteman, name of long hair.

1388
01:38:59.28 --> 01:39:02.52
The soldier, big chief, we killed on the little big horn.

1389
01:39:02.52 --> 01:39:05.16
I was told he was called general custer.

1390
01:39:05.16 --> 01:39:09.48
I had heard his name spoken at the White River Agency, but I do not understand clearly

1391
01:39:09.48 --> 01:39:10.72
who was meant by it.

1392
01:39:10.72 --> 01:39:15.24
The southern shians knew of him because of his having fought against them before he had come

1393
01:39:15.24 --> 01:39:17.20
into our northern country.

1394
01:39:17.20 --> 01:39:21.32
They had surrendered to him.

1395
01:39:21.32 --> 01:39:25.20
After we've been a year on this reservation, many of our people began to be asked to be

1396
01:39:25.20 --> 01:39:27.000
taken back to the north.

1397
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.20
There was no game here.

1398
01:39:28.20 --> 01:39:32.20
And we were not allowed to go off the reservation for hunting and we were not given food

1399
01:39:32.20 --> 01:39:33.72
as it had been promised.

1400
01:39:33.72 --> 01:39:35.36
We should be given.

1401
01:39:35.36 --> 01:39:39.36
At time some of our young men would violate the orders and would slip away from the

1402
01:39:39.36 --> 01:39:43.56
reservation to get a buffalo or some other animal good to eat.

1403
01:39:43.56 --> 01:39:47.20
Some white people said the Indians were killing their cattle.

1404
01:39:47.20 --> 01:39:49.44
I do not know I did not do this.

1405
01:39:49.44 --> 01:39:54.32
I stayed alt the time on the reservation, but if any Indians did kill the whiteman cattle,

1406
01:39:54.32 --> 01:39:58.84
they did so because they were very hungry you could not find any wild game.

1407
01:39:58.84 --> 01:40:01.80
We ate the beef because it was the best we could get.

1408
01:40:01.80 --> 01:40:05.12
We always liked much better the wild game.

1409
01:40:05.12 --> 01:40:08.68
There was much sickness among the northern shians.

1410
01:40:08.68 --> 01:40:13.04
To us it was a new kind of sickness, chills and fever and aching of the bones dragged

1411
01:40:13.04 --> 01:40:16.04
down most of us to thin and weak bodies.

1412
01:40:16.04 --> 01:40:20.44
Our people died, died, and kept following each another, following one another out of this

1413
01:40:20.44 --> 01:40:21.84
world.

1414
01:40:21.84 --> 01:40:27.44
Finally little wolf declared that he for one was moving back north.

1415
01:40:27.44 --> 01:40:31.32
Whether the white people, consented or not.

1416
01:40:31.32 --> 01:40:32.92
Others said they would follow him.

1417
01:40:32.92 --> 01:40:37.52
The agent told them that the soldiers were going to train and would kill them.

1418
01:40:37.52 --> 01:40:38.96
They were promised more food.

1419
01:40:38.96 --> 01:40:42.68
They waited for it, but it did not come.

1420
01:40:42.68 --> 01:40:45.12
More people flocked to little wolf side.

1421
01:40:45.12 --> 01:40:47.68
Don't knife said he would go to.

1422
01:40:47.68 --> 01:40:51.40
Late in the summer more than half the tribe started out.

1423
01:40:51.40 --> 01:40:56.72
Little wolf's last message to the agent was, the soldiers make kill all of us, but they

1424
01:40:56.72 --> 01:40:59.76
cannot make a stay in this country.

1425
01:40:59.76 --> 01:41:01.48
The soldiers went after them.

1426
01:41:01.48 --> 01:41:04.28
Other soldiers from other places were sent out to head them off.

1427
01:41:04.28 --> 01:41:06.76
The shians were hunted from all directions.

1428
01:41:06.76 --> 01:41:10.60
They were found many times, but each time the shians fought off their pursuers and kept

1429
01:41:10.60 --> 01:41:13.000
moving northward.

1430
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.84
Many of our people were killed, but most of them got back to their old home country and

1431
01:41:17.84 --> 01:41:21.40
were allowed to stay there.

1432
01:41:21.40 --> 01:41:25.000
From the southern shians, I learned a great deal about general clusters dealing with

1433
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.36
them in that country.

1434
01:41:27.36 --> 01:41:32.28
All of them said he had smoked the peace pipe with them at that time that they had surrendered

1435
01:41:32.28 --> 01:41:35.52
to him seven years before he was killed.

1436
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:40.84
According to the custom among us, this was understood as a promise by him that never again

1437
01:41:40.84 --> 01:41:43.76
would he fight against the shians.

1438
01:41:43.76 --> 01:41:48.08
When they learned that he had been killed by our people in the Sioux, they considered

1439
01:41:48.08 --> 01:41:53.44
him as having deserve that kind of death on account of his failure to keep his peace

1440
01:41:53.44 --> 01:41:56.56
oath.

1441
01:41:56.56 --> 01:42:00.04
I got a wife from the southern shians.

1442
01:42:00.04 --> 01:42:05.84
She had been a girl at the Shian camp at the Washits river when Custer and his soldiers came

1443
01:42:05.84 --> 01:42:11.56
there and killed many shians and burned their lodges in November of 1968.

1444
01:42:11.56 --> 01:42:15.40
Chief Blackpot was one of the ones killed.

1445
01:42:15.40 --> 01:42:19.12
The women and children fled same as ours had done at powder river.

1446
01:42:19.12 --> 01:42:25.000
It was winter and there was many and there was at that time a deep snow for that country.

1447
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.68
Soldiers chased the women and children and killed many of them as well as the men.

1448
01:42:29.68 --> 01:42:35.48
My wife at that time a girl was barefooted as others were also.

1449
01:42:35.48 --> 01:42:37.84
They had been surprised in the early morning.

1450
01:42:37.84 --> 01:42:42.72
She stopped and cut off pieces of buffalo robe to tie about a feet to keep them warm as

1451
01:42:42.72 --> 01:42:44.40
she ran.

1452
01:42:44.40 --> 01:42:49.60
When they got to the camp, it's of snake Indians, further down the river.

1453
01:42:49.60 --> 01:42:53.76
My wife told me she was also with the shians when they surrendered to General Custer in

1454
01:42:53.76 --> 01:42:56.44
1869.

1455
01:42:56.44 --> 01:43:00.04
She had smoked the pipe with their chiefs when they surrendered.

1456
01:43:00.04 --> 01:43:04.36
Some of the chiefs were put in a prison and had chains upon their ankles.

1457
01:43:04.36 --> 01:43:10.32
When I heard all of this from my wife as well as from many of the other southern shians,

1458
01:43:10.32 --> 01:43:16.12
it seemed the great medicine may have directed Custer to his death as punishment for having

1459
01:43:16.12 --> 01:43:23.36
broken his promise to the shians.

1460
01:43:23.36 --> 01:43:37.84
So eventually they do go back north and they re-establish reservations up in the north and

1461
01:43:37.84 --> 01:43:41.72
eventually wouldn't leg proceeds up there as well.

1462
01:43:41.72 --> 01:43:48.24
When he gets up there, he seems like things are in a pretty bad way.

1463
01:43:48.24 --> 01:43:49.76
Back to the book.

1464
01:43:49.76 --> 01:43:54.72
The most sorrowful new condition we found in coming back to our shian country was in the

1465
01:43:54.72 --> 01:43:58.28
case of little wolf himself.

1466
01:43:58.28 --> 01:44:02.84
Some white men about the fort were selling or giving whiskey to the Indians.

1467
01:44:02.84 --> 01:44:07.84
One night, little wolf got a bottle of whiskey and right away he drank all of it.

1468
01:44:07.84 --> 01:44:12.76
He went into the fort, traders store and leaned forward upon the counter.

1469
01:44:12.76 --> 01:44:16.20
He was quiet but he was dizzy and stumbling here and there.

1470
01:44:16.20 --> 01:44:21.40
The trader said little wolf, you'd better go to your lodge but he said no, I want to stay

1471
01:44:21.40 --> 01:44:23.000
here.

1472
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.28
Some shian men and women were playing cards at a table in the store, famished elk, a young man's

1473
01:44:28.28 --> 01:44:30.60
sergeant of the scouts was with them.

1474
01:44:30.60 --> 01:44:35.000
He talked a little wolf but the old chief paid no attention to his talk.

1475
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.48
Famished wolf took hold of little wolf's arm and said, come I will help you to get you to

1476
01:44:38.48 --> 01:44:39.88
your lodge.

1477
01:44:39.88 --> 01:44:44.68
He spoke and acted respectfully but little wolf was angered because of the taking hold of

1478
01:44:44.68 --> 01:44:45.92
him.

1479
01:44:45.92 --> 01:44:49.80
He pulled himself away, his eyes blazed like fire.

1480
01:44:49.80 --> 01:44:57.24
He stood a moment looking at the young man, then he said, I will kill you.

1481
01:44:57.24 --> 01:45:02.92
He staggered alone on out from the store, famished elk returned to sit in the card game,

1482
01:45:02.92 --> 01:45:05.84
nobody was expecting any further trouble.

1483
01:45:05.84 --> 01:45:10.72
But not long afterward the door was opened and a little wolf stumbled into the room.

1484
01:45:10.72 --> 01:45:16.80
He straightened himself out, levelled or rifle and fired.

1485
01:45:16.80 --> 01:45:21.08
Famished elk sank down dead upon the floor.

1486
01:45:21.08 --> 01:45:24.84
The old chief went back to his lodge and told his two wives what he had done.

1487
01:45:24.84 --> 01:45:27.20
We must go, he added.

1488
01:45:27.20 --> 01:45:30.88
The three of them went out into the darkness of the night, soldiers and shian searched

1489
01:45:30.88 --> 01:45:31.88
for them.

1490
01:45:31.88 --> 01:45:33.92
They searched during the next day and the next.

1491
01:45:33.92 --> 01:45:38.44
The missing man and his two wives appeared in myel city and sat themselves down in a place

1492
01:45:38.44 --> 01:45:40.40
and playing view of the people there.

1493
01:45:40.40 --> 01:45:42.44
A captain and some soldiers went to him.

1494
01:45:42.44 --> 01:45:46.88
The captain we knew as little chief.

1495
01:45:46.88 --> 01:45:51.12
He told little wolf what it was he had done.

1496
01:45:51.12 --> 01:45:56.96
He said, he further told him, you are no more a chief of the shian's.

1497
01:45:56.96 --> 01:46:00.96
That is true and just little wolf willful greed.

1498
01:46:00.96 --> 01:46:05.92
He was not punished in any other way, but he further punished himself.

1499
01:46:05.92 --> 01:46:10.84
Or he and his wives had left their lodge, he smashed into pieces his medicine pipe.

1500
01:46:10.84 --> 01:46:12.80
Our old tribal laws required this.

1501
01:46:12.80 --> 01:46:15.68
It was not allowable for him afterward to smoke.

1502
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:20.64
It was allowable for him afterward to smoke all alone and any small and short stemmed pipes

1503
01:46:20.64 --> 01:46:25.28
such as might be made from a deer leg bone, but he did not do this.

1504
01:46:25.28 --> 01:46:27.80
He denied himself all smoking.

1505
01:46:27.80 --> 01:46:33.96
He never made any offer even to sit in the company of other shian smoking together.

1506
01:46:33.96 --> 01:46:39.76
The equipment offered him sometimes cigarettes, but he always refused them.

1507
01:46:39.76 --> 01:46:45.68
After time he learned to chew tobacco a habit never followed by the old-time shian's.

1508
01:46:45.68 --> 01:46:50.28
It seemed he did this deliberately for self-humiliation.

1509
01:46:50.28 --> 01:46:54.72
He never tried to intrude himself on any trouble tribal public affairs.

1510
01:46:54.72 --> 01:46:59.96
The people remembered his great services in past times, but nobody consulted him on tribal

1511
01:46:59.96 --> 01:47:03.08
matters in present times.

1512
01:47:03.08 --> 01:47:12.32
Literally in every way he was never more a chief among the shian's.

1513
01:47:12.32 --> 01:47:24.08
So alcohol, not good, not good for your decision-making processes.

1514
01:47:24.08 --> 01:47:25.96
Back to the book.

1515
01:47:25.96 --> 01:47:31.72
When I was 31 years old in 1889, I enlisted with other shian's to form a new band of

1516
01:47:31.72 --> 01:47:36.76
scouts for the soldiers at 4K.

1517
01:47:36.76 --> 01:47:41.52
For a long time we did not do much except drill and work at getting out logs from the

1518
01:47:41.52 --> 01:47:43.68
timber and building houses for ourselves.

1519
01:47:43.68 --> 01:47:45.44
So he joins the army.

1520
01:47:45.44 --> 01:47:49.92
He joins the army becomes a scout.

1521
01:47:49.92 --> 01:47:52.72
We shian scouts had not get into any battle.

1522
01:47:52.72 --> 01:47:57.24
At one time we were all dressed and ready, but the officers made a stop behind the hill

1523
01:47:57.24 --> 01:48:02.28
while the soldiers went on and killed many sew in a camp on a little valley just over the

1524
01:48:02.28 --> 01:48:03.28
hill.

1525
01:48:03.28 --> 01:48:08.16
A sew started that fight by killing an officer who was taking all the guns from them.

1526
01:48:08.16 --> 01:48:13.48
The soldiers began to shoot and many women and children were killed as well.

1527
01:48:13.48 --> 01:48:17.56
This trouble was on wounded knee creek.

1528
01:48:17.56 --> 01:48:21.40
At the time of our advance up the hill, I was wearing a war bonnet for the first time

1529
01:48:21.40 --> 01:48:22.40
in any battle.

1530
01:48:22.40 --> 01:48:29.12
He was talking about they were present at the massacre at wounded knee, which was a horrible

1531
01:48:29.12 --> 01:48:31.64
massacre committed you can hear.

1532
01:48:31.64 --> 01:48:42.16
It was between 150 and 300 sew were killed by soldiers and it included probably about

1533
01:48:42.16 --> 01:48:48.16
half of them were women and children.

1534
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:56.08
And later he's talking about some dreams it has.

1535
01:48:56.08 --> 01:49:00.96
Back to the book I believe I slept, but I'm not sure whether I was sleeping and dreaming

1536
01:49:00.96 --> 01:49:03.36
or I was only lying there and thinking.

1537
01:49:03.36 --> 01:49:08.08
I kept my cartridge belt buckled on me and I hugged my rifle to my body.

1538
01:49:08.08 --> 01:49:11.12
It seemed that angry sue Indians were all about me.

1539
01:49:11.12 --> 01:49:14.56
They were searching for me to kill me.

1540
01:49:14.56 --> 01:49:18.04
Some of them were striking at me with war clubs and slashing at me with knives.

1541
01:49:18.04 --> 01:49:22.80
I heard them calling my name wouldn't leg.

1542
01:49:22.80 --> 01:49:26.08
I jumped up and stood there wide awake.

1543
01:49:26.08 --> 01:49:28.16
So he's having nightmares.

1544
01:49:28.16 --> 01:49:36.20
He's a massacre happens and he feels like obviously subconsciously he's got some

1545
01:49:36.20 --> 01:49:40.44
nightmares about that.

1546
01:49:40.44 --> 01:49:53.20
Now back to the story of Little Wolf, the chief that shot the other Indian at the card game.

1547
01:49:53.20 --> 01:49:57.000
Back to the book one day I saw the old man Little Wolf at the camp.

1548
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.56
This is a year's later.

1549
01:49:58.56 --> 01:50:01.36
I said to my wife I see Little Wolf.

1550
01:50:01.36 --> 01:50:03.24
He's my relative.

1551
01:50:03.24 --> 01:50:06.56
One of his wives is a sister of my father.

1552
01:50:06.56 --> 01:50:10.04
I think I ought to invite him to eat in our lodge.

1553
01:50:10.04 --> 01:50:13.96
I'm glad to hear you say that chance or tell him to come now.

1554
01:50:13.96 --> 01:50:18.56
Right away, he should begin to prepare bread and meat and coffee.

1555
01:50:18.56 --> 01:50:24.16
When I brought Little Wolf around, I found he was partly drunk.

1556
01:50:24.16 --> 01:50:27.64
He fumbled the food and he sat and ate.

1557
01:50:27.64 --> 01:50:30.68
He ate freely as though he were very hungry.

1558
01:50:30.68 --> 01:50:34.32
He kept quiet and kept looking downward during all the time.

1559
01:50:34.32 --> 01:50:39.72
When he was done eating, I told him of my sympathy with him in his great trouble.

1560
01:50:39.72 --> 01:50:43.000
He then told me all about the affair.

1561
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.88
I love the young man and all of his people.

1562
01:50:45.88 --> 01:50:48.68
I was crazy when I shot him.

1563
01:50:48.68 --> 01:50:53.88
At this time in the conversation, Little Wolf was about 70 years old.

1564
01:50:53.88 --> 01:50:58.000
This man gave away all of his horses after he had been put out of his position as our

1565
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.40
greatest chief.

1566
01:51:00.40 --> 01:51:03.44
After that all of his traveling was done of foot.

1567
01:51:03.44 --> 01:51:08.08
Sometimes he went alone, sometimes a wanderer both of his wives accompanied him.

1568
01:51:08.08 --> 01:51:12.24
He took, along whatever packs they could carry and they slept in temporary shelters or

1569
01:51:12.24 --> 01:51:14.16
with no shelter.

1570
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:16.32
He went at times to visit the crows.

1571
01:51:16.32 --> 01:51:22.96
He visited also the Arapahose, in Wyoming, walking 200 miles or more back and again.

1572
01:51:22.96 --> 01:51:27.16
He died in 1904 at the age of 83 years.

1573
01:51:27.16 --> 01:51:32.56
His wives and close friends stood his body upright on a high hill overlooking the Rose

1574
01:51:32.56 --> 01:51:37.76
Bud Valley where many shions had their reservation homes.

1575
01:51:37.76 --> 01:51:45.16
A great heap of stones was built to enclose him thus standing upright.

1576
01:51:45.16 --> 01:51:50.20
Twenty-four years later his bones were brought to the agency cemetery and put into a grave

1577
01:51:50.20 --> 01:51:51.20
there.

1578
01:51:51.20 --> 01:51:57.08
Bird, the old-time Indian story white man who lives in New York had a stone put at the

1579
01:51:57.08 --> 01:52:01.28
head of this agency grave.

1580
01:52:01.28 --> 01:52:06.000
Even in the nearest of relatives of even the nearest relatives of famished elk never

1581
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.28
kept bad hearts against little wolf.

1582
01:52:09.28 --> 01:52:14.08
At different times I've heard talk of him from bald eagle, a brother of the young man

1583
01:52:14.08 --> 01:52:15.08
killed.

1584
01:52:15.08 --> 01:52:19.12
Bald eagle said little wolf did not kill my brother.

1585
01:52:19.12 --> 01:52:27.40
It was the white man whiskey that did it.

1586
01:52:27.40 --> 01:52:32.12
Now we fast forward.

1587
01:52:32.12 --> 01:52:35.92
Thirty years after the great battle against the custer there was a gathering of Indians

1588
01:52:35.92 --> 01:52:38.88
and white people at little big horn.

1589
01:52:38.88 --> 01:52:44.32
The shions and some other Indians went with a few soldiers to Fort Custer, not far from

1590
01:52:44.32 --> 01:52:48.36
the place where the great battle had been.

1591
01:52:48.36 --> 01:52:52.80
The soldiers at the Fort Shokans with all of us, we gathered together in some friendly

1592
01:52:52.80 --> 01:52:57.04
speeches were made by the officers and Indians.

1593
01:52:57.04 --> 01:53:01.96
All I said was, a long time ago we were enemies.

1594
01:53:01.96 --> 01:53:08.72
Today we are friends.

1595
01:53:08.72 --> 01:53:18.76
And going even further into the adult 50 years old now.

1596
01:53:18.76 --> 01:53:23.92
Wooden Leg says, I was baptized by the priest at Tong River Mission when I was almost

1597
01:53:23.92 --> 01:53:25.96
50 years old.

1598
01:53:25.96 --> 01:53:28.48
My wife and our two daughters were baptized too.

1599
01:53:28.48 --> 01:53:34.68
I think the white people prayed to the same great medicine we do in our old shion way.

1600
01:53:34.68 --> 01:53:39.72
I did not go to church often, but I do go sometimes.

1601
01:53:39.72 --> 01:53:44.44
I think the white church people are good, but do not believe all the stories they tell

1602
01:53:44.44 --> 01:53:46.84
about what happened the long time ago.

1603
01:53:46.84 --> 01:53:51.80
The way they tell us, all the good people in the old times were white people.

1604
01:53:51.80 --> 01:53:56.08
I'm glad to have the white man churches among us, but I feel more satisfied when I make

1605
01:53:56.08 --> 01:54:00.40
my prayers in the way I was taught to make them.

1606
01:54:00.40 --> 01:54:05.08
My heart is much more contented when I sit alone with my medicine pipe and talk with

1607
01:54:05.08 --> 01:54:09.80
the great medicine about whatever may be troubling me.

1608
01:54:09.80 --> 01:54:12.32
We had good medicine men in the old times.

1609
01:54:12.32 --> 01:54:16.52
It may be that they did not know of as much about sickness as the white men doctors know,

1610
01:54:16.52 --> 01:54:21.12
but our doctors knew more about Indians and how to talk to them.

1611
01:54:21.12 --> 01:54:29.64
Our people then did not die young as they so much as they do now.

1612
01:54:29.64 --> 01:54:34.24
Now wouldn't leg have had a couple of daughters.

1613
01:54:34.24 --> 01:54:36.08
He talks about them here.

1614
01:54:36.08 --> 01:54:41.04
The younger daughter fell into an illness when she was about 14 years old.

1615
01:54:41.04 --> 01:54:48.40
We expected she would soon be herself again, but she grew worse instead of better.

1616
01:54:48.40 --> 01:54:52.76
She became so weak she could not stay at school any longer.

1617
01:54:52.76 --> 01:54:56.92
She continued to go downward after we brought her into our home.

1618
01:54:56.92 --> 01:55:01.92
Finally her spirit went back to the great medicine.

1619
01:55:01.92 --> 01:55:05.24
All of our love was now fixed upon the other daughter.

1620
01:55:05.24 --> 01:55:08.08
She advanced to full young womanhood.

1621
01:55:08.08 --> 01:55:13.48
She could read the white man books she could write letters to our friends far away, but

1622
01:55:13.48 --> 01:55:18.08
she too became ill, same as her younger sister.

1623
01:55:18.08 --> 01:55:21.24
During all of one winter she gradually wasted away.

1624
01:55:21.24 --> 01:55:26.28
Every afternoon her body burned with fever, every night her bed was soaked with sweating.

1625
01:55:26.28 --> 01:55:29.52
Every morning she coughed almost to strangling.

1626
01:55:29.52 --> 01:55:34.000
Neither the medicines of the agency physician nor the prayers of our own medicine men could

1627
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.84
help her.

1628
01:55:35.84 --> 01:55:42.60
Just when the spring grass was coming up she was buried in our mission cemetery.

1629
01:55:42.60 --> 01:55:45.48
My heart fell down to the ground.

1630
01:55:45.48 --> 01:55:51.000
I decided then that the white man's school is not good for Indian children.

1631
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.44
I think they do not get enough of meat at the boarding school.

1632
01:55:54.44 --> 01:55:57.48
I think that they are kept in school too much during the year.

1633
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:01.80
They ought to be out and free to go as they please during all of the good weather of

1634
01:56:01.80 --> 01:56:10.48
the autumn and the spring.

1635
01:56:10.48 --> 01:56:23.64
In the book closes out in the last years of wooden legs life and he's all and he's respected

1636
01:56:23.64 --> 01:56:33.16
and he's living safely on a reservation.

1637
01:56:33.16 --> 01:56:41.08
He says it is comfortable to live in peace on the reservation.

1638
01:56:41.08 --> 01:56:46.08
It is pleasant to be situated where I can sleep soundly every night without fear that my

1639
01:56:46.08 --> 01:56:56.12
horses may be stolen or that myself or my friends may be crept upon and killed.

1640
01:56:56.12 --> 01:57:06.80
But I like to think about the old times when every man had to be brave.

1641
01:57:06.80 --> 01:57:14.80
I wish I could live again through some of the past days when it was first thought of

1642
01:57:14.80 --> 01:57:17.08
every prospering Indian.

1643
01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:22.24
The first thought of every prospering Indian was to send out the call.

1644
01:57:22.24 --> 01:57:29.12
A whole friend's come come.

1645
01:57:29.12 --> 01:57:30.80
I have plenty of buffalo meat.

1646
01:57:30.80 --> 01:57:31.80
I have coffee.

1647
01:57:31.80 --> 01:57:32.80
I have sugar.

1648
01:57:32.80 --> 01:57:35.36
I have tobacco.

1649
01:57:35.36 --> 01:57:37.000
Com friends.

1650
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:50.20
Feast and smoke with me.

1651
01:57:50.20 --> 01:58:00.12
And I'll tell you that I miss those days too.

1652
01:58:00.12 --> 01:58:16.80
When every man had to be brave, when comfort was no guarantee, when life itself wasn't

1653
01:58:16.80 --> 01:58:20.16
a guarantee.

1654
01:58:20.16 --> 01:58:31.12
And I think that is one of the lessons to be taken from wooden leg is something you hear

1655
01:58:31.12 --> 01:58:35.60
me say often is that you have to cherish it.

1656
01:58:35.60 --> 01:58:46.72
Cherish the struggle, the contest, the suffering, the risk don't shy away from it.

1657
01:58:46.72 --> 01:58:53.72
Instead, cherish it.

1658
01:58:53.72 --> 01:59:02.48
And another piece that I find so important, so reinforcing to what I see in the world is

1659
01:59:02.48 --> 01:59:08.04
look at how the science were beaten.

1660
01:59:08.04 --> 01:59:10.48
It wasn't an war.

1661
01:59:10.48 --> 01:59:17.80
It wasn't in battle.

1662
01:59:17.80 --> 01:59:22.80
They weren't defeated by the white man's guns or the white man's tactics.

1663
01:59:22.80 --> 01:59:28.36
They were slowly taken apart.

1664
01:59:28.36 --> 01:59:36.60
Convinced to take an easier path.

1665
01:59:36.60 --> 01:59:42.60
And enticed by the comfort of the reservations.

1666
01:59:42.60 --> 01:59:52.80
Where food, shelter, tobacco and alcohol were all readily available.

1667
01:59:52.80 --> 02:00:00.68
They were defeated in some decisive battle by weapons or by war.

1668
02:00:00.68 --> 02:00:16.44
They were defeated and controlled by one tiny, seemingly insignificant surrender at a time.

1669
02:00:16.44 --> 02:00:30.16
Giving up their land and giving up their horses and giving up their guns.

1670
02:00:30.16 --> 02:00:33.52
They were tricked.

1671
02:00:33.52 --> 02:00:36.000
They were lied to.

1672
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.56
And the word was not kept and the promises were not kept, but they gave up their ability

1673
02:00:42.56 --> 02:00:47.92
to fight back.

1674
02:00:47.92 --> 02:00:50.56
Then it's hard to guard against that.

1675
02:00:50.56 --> 02:00:56.24
It's hard to even see it happening because it's like trying to watch an hour hand move.

1676
02:00:56.24 --> 02:01:00.48
You don't see it.

1677
02:01:00.48 --> 02:01:02.48
You don't see it move.

1678
02:01:02.48 --> 02:01:16.44
Then you turn around and this beautiful and this magnificent warrior culture is relegated to

1679
02:01:16.44 --> 02:01:32.04
whiskey and dependency and entrapment for reservations.

1680
02:01:32.04 --> 02:01:36.72
And I think that's an important message.

1681
02:01:36.72 --> 02:01:40.20
I think that's an important message for our culture.

1682
02:01:40.20 --> 02:01:47.80
Because culture that we have now, the culture of creativity and of open mindedness and of

1683
02:01:47.80 --> 02:01:54.16
strength and of individual freedom.

1684
02:01:54.16 --> 02:01:59.08
That we need to stay vigilant.

1685
02:01:59.08 --> 02:02:06.96
We need to stand guard against small infractions that may seem meaningless and insignificant,

1686
02:02:06.96 --> 02:02:20.32
but that will chip away that who you are as a people and as a culture.

1687
02:02:20.32 --> 02:02:27.72
And the Native Americans, I mean we could go on and on about the bravery that those

1688
02:02:27.72 --> 02:02:34.000
warriors showed, even past this period in World War II, there's a story upon story about

1689
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:43.24
the bravery that they showed in the Vietnam War, Native Americans that served with honor and courage.

1690
02:02:43.24 --> 02:02:48.88
We have to learn more than just that.

1691
02:02:48.88 --> 02:02:55.76
And I think it's the same thing on an individual level as well.

1692
02:02:55.76 --> 02:03:00.92
Because it's not that we as people, it's not that we as an individual as a person, it's

1693
02:03:00.92 --> 02:03:05.96
a wake up one day and you decide that's it.

1694
02:03:05.96 --> 02:03:06.96
I give up.

1695
02:03:06.96 --> 02:03:10.36
I'm going to be weak now.

1696
02:03:10.36 --> 02:03:14.56
I'm just going to just surrender everything to be comfortable.

1697
02:03:14.56 --> 02:03:15.96
We don't do that in one day.

1698
02:03:15.96 --> 02:03:16.96
It doesn't happen.

1699
02:03:16.96 --> 02:03:17.96
It's not one decision.

1700
02:03:17.96 --> 02:03:26.28
It's a slow incremental process that just chips away.

1701
02:03:26.28 --> 02:03:30.000
It's a way it will and chips away in our discipline.

1702
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.52
We wake up a little bit later and we miss a workout and we miss another one and we

1703
02:03:34.52 --> 02:03:38.60
start to eat but we shouldn't eat and we start to drink what we shouldn't drink and without

1704
02:03:38.60 --> 02:03:43.80
even realizing it one day you wake up and you become something that you never would

1705
02:03:43.80 --> 02:03:48.84
have allowed.

1706
02:03:48.84 --> 02:03:56.84
And instead of being strong, you're weak.

1707
02:03:56.84 --> 02:04:03.000
And instead of being disciplined, you are disorganized and you are lost.

1708
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:13.48
And instead of moving forward and progressing, you are moving backward and you are decaying.

1709
02:04:13.48 --> 02:04:18.52
And that happens without us even seeing it.

1710
02:04:18.52 --> 02:04:26.52
Without us recognizing it.

1711
02:04:26.52 --> 02:04:31.28
So you have to be vigilant.

1712
02:04:31.28 --> 02:04:33.000
You have to be on guard.

1713
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.20
You have to hold the line even on the seemingly insignificant little things.

1714
02:04:38.20 --> 02:04:43.96
Things that shouldn't matter but those things do matter.

1715
02:04:43.96 --> 02:04:52.52
And instead of going backward instead of decaying, get stronger, get better, grow and

1716
02:04:52.52 --> 02:04:58.84
learn and develop and live.

1717
02:04:58.84 --> 02:05:06.20
And live in such a way that you don't remember the old days with sorrow that they are

1718
02:05:06.20 --> 02:05:09.64
gone but with pride.

1719
02:05:09.64 --> 02:05:19.64
And with gratitude that those old days led you to where you are today.

1720
02:05:19.64 --> 02:05:30.64
The place of wisdom and a place of knowledge and a place of experience and a place of peace.

1721
02:05:30.64 --> 02:05:46.72
And I certainly hope that wouldn't lag found his peace with the great medicine.

1722
02:05:46.72 --> 02:05:53.84
You don't have any, I don't know if I mean you are probably one of the few people that I know

1723
02:05:53.84 --> 02:05:59.04
anyway that probably didn't go through high school and think about history class

1724
02:05:59.04 --> 02:06:01.76
when am I ever going to use this?

1725
02:06:01.76 --> 02:06:04.56
A lot of us think thought that.

1726
02:06:04.56 --> 02:06:06.96
And like this kind of stuff, right?

1727
02:06:06.96 --> 02:06:07.96
Like actual stuff.

1728
02:06:07.96 --> 02:06:12.96
History, history, history, history class and it probably was.

1729
02:06:12.96 --> 02:06:15.56
You had to have learned about about a little big horn.

1730
02:06:15.56 --> 02:06:16.56
You had to have.

1731
02:06:16.56 --> 02:06:17.56
You may not remember it.

1732
02:06:17.56 --> 02:06:18.56
I don't remember from high school.

1733
02:06:18.56 --> 02:06:19.56
That was whatever.

1734
02:06:19.56 --> 02:06:20.56
40 something years ago.

1735
02:06:20.56 --> 02:06:22.56
One did knee rings a bell.

1736
02:06:22.56 --> 02:06:23.56
You know.

1737
02:06:23.56 --> 02:06:24.56
Yeah.

1738
02:06:24.56 --> 02:06:28.96
So that was probably that attitude.

1739
02:06:28.96 --> 02:06:29.96
For most of us.

1740
02:06:29.96 --> 02:06:31.44
Like what are we going to use this?

1741
02:06:31.44 --> 02:06:34.92
Why do I gotta know this 1776?

1742
02:06:34.92 --> 02:06:35.92
Why do I gotta know?

1743
02:06:35.92 --> 02:06:36.92
Why?

1744
02:06:36.92 --> 02:06:41.12
How is this going to help me in my job that I'm going to be a doctor?

1745
02:06:41.12 --> 02:06:45.76
Whatever, even if you had high aspirations.

1746
02:06:45.76 --> 02:06:52.88
So this, that last part, you just said, but that's why.

1747
02:06:52.88 --> 02:06:55.64
For real, what part?

1748
02:06:55.64 --> 02:06:56.64
What do you mean the whole part?

1749
02:06:56.64 --> 02:06:57.64
The whole part.

1750
02:06:57.64 --> 02:07:01.28
Yeah, at the end where you're like, okay, look, and here's what how it was explained to

1751
02:07:01.28 --> 02:07:02.76
me by my mom and dad.

1752
02:07:02.76 --> 02:07:07.32
History is important because you have all the people that you learned about, all the events

1753
02:07:07.32 --> 02:07:08.72
you learn about.

1754
02:07:08.72 --> 02:07:11.36
You learn lessons out of it.

1755
02:07:11.36 --> 02:07:15.40
Of course as a kid, you're like, all right, well, you know, I'm just memorizing dates

1756
02:07:15.40 --> 02:07:16.56
and events here.

1757
02:07:16.56 --> 02:07:18.48
But they're like, no, you learn lessons.

1758
02:07:18.48 --> 02:07:22.88
Like history, you know, wars, all that, this is all the like settle problems.

1759
02:07:22.88 --> 02:07:24.56
You gotta learn lessons from Mr. Mike.

1760
02:07:24.56 --> 02:07:27.56
All right, I get it.

1761
02:07:27.56 --> 02:07:32.000
This, I think, on an, like on a group level, you can learn a lot less than of course

1762
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.68
from history and this on an individual level.

1763
02:07:34.68 --> 02:07:36.80
Everybody, especially now, bro.

1764
02:07:36.80 --> 02:07:40.04
Now it's like, I was thinking about this today.

1765
02:07:40.04 --> 02:07:41.04
Okay, I'm driving home.

1766
02:07:41.04 --> 02:07:47.28
I went to the pumpkin patch, right, and the pumpkin patch is, it's a, it's really cool.

1767
02:07:47.28 --> 02:07:50.88
It's a, it was down in Bonit, it was, it wasn't like a built one and a parking lot.

1768
02:07:50.88 --> 02:07:51.88
There you go, too.

1769
02:07:51.88 --> 02:07:56.80
It was like a legit one and hard leaning one there and my daughter's running around.

1770
02:07:56.80 --> 02:08:00.64
And, you know, my wife comes from the country and stuff.

1771
02:08:00.64 --> 02:08:05.16
So she's like, see, this kind of pumpkin patch is great compared to the ones that built

1772
02:08:05.16 --> 02:08:06.16
in the parking lots.

1773
02:08:06.16 --> 02:08:11.76
And I'm thinking, that's where we are today, where all, not a pumpkin patch.

1774
02:08:11.76 --> 02:08:13.40
Let's go build a pumpkin patch.

1775
02:08:13.40 --> 02:08:16.48
Like that's how, how little really we have to do.

1776
02:08:16.48 --> 02:08:18.28
We're building pumpkin patches.

1777
02:08:18.28 --> 02:08:21.72
So you can go experience a pumpkin patch on pavement.

1778
02:08:21.72 --> 02:08:22.88
Yes, on an parking lot.

1779
02:08:22.88 --> 02:08:23.88
In a parking lot.

1780
02:08:23.88 --> 02:08:26.60
Yeah, we're done with this, you know, built thing.

1781
02:08:26.60 --> 02:08:29.72
We get, you know, you have shows on TV.

1782
02:08:29.72 --> 02:08:33.20
I always harp on reality, but man, this is the reality.

1783
02:08:33.20 --> 02:08:34.20
PUN.

1784
02:08:34.20 --> 02:08:35.20
Of it.

1785
02:08:35.20 --> 02:08:41.16
Where we have time now, the time and the inclination to sit and watch hours of just

1786
02:08:41.16 --> 02:08:42.76
other people living there.

1787
02:08:42.76 --> 02:08:43.76
Yeah, that's the system.

1788
02:08:43.76 --> 02:08:44.76
That's the thing.

1789
02:08:44.76 --> 02:08:45.76
That's where we are today.

1790
02:08:45.76 --> 02:08:49.84
I'm not saying we all do it, but I'm saying we can't, we want.

1791
02:08:49.84 --> 02:08:50.92
Yeah, we can't if we want.

1792
02:08:50.92 --> 02:08:52.92
That's where we are.

1793
02:08:52.92 --> 02:08:54.60
So consider that.

1794
02:08:54.60 --> 02:08:55.92
That's the opposite of this.

1795
02:08:55.92 --> 02:08:58.52
That's like basically what you're talking about right there.

1796
02:08:58.52 --> 02:08:59.52
Yeah.

1797
02:08:59.52 --> 02:09:04.24
Where you're like, okay, the more like kind of, you didn't really say avoid luxury and

1798
02:09:04.24 --> 02:09:05.24
nothing like that.

1799
02:09:05.24 --> 02:09:08.80
But basically, you keep your capability and check.

1800
02:09:08.80 --> 02:09:13.28
You know, like, I don't want to miss the old days when I was capable.

1801
02:09:13.28 --> 02:09:16.56
Because I gave it up to be more comfortable.

1802
02:09:16.56 --> 02:09:21.24
That's the less than I think that you can learn individually.

1803
02:09:21.24 --> 02:09:22.64
Yeah, no doubt.

1804
02:09:22.64 --> 02:09:26.40
And I think even, you know, the culture.

1805
02:09:26.40 --> 02:09:30.28
We're talking about cultures, the cultures of warriors.

1806
02:09:30.28 --> 02:09:31.28
Yeah.

1807
02:09:31.28 --> 02:09:37.44
That, you know, they got overrun by the white man, right?

1808
02:09:37.44 --> 02:09:38.44
Overrun by the white man.

1809
02:09:38.44 --> 02:09:42.08
Now there was brutal battles and we're going to go, I mean, you could spend all day

1810
02:09:42.08 --> 02:09:43.08
talking about.

1811
02:09:43.08 --> 02:09:46.20
But we're talking, I'm just speaking about one aspect of this.

1812
02:09:46.20 --> 02:09:51.60
You had incredible warrior cultures that had lived this way for unknown amount of time,

1813
02:09:51.60 --> 02:09:52.44
thousands of years.

1814
02:09:52.44 --> 02:09:58.24
And in what, 50 years or something, 100 years, it was completely different for them.

1815
02:09:58.24 --> 02:10:03.24
And yeah, and what I'm saying is, you think that they got

1816
02:10:03.24 --> 02:10:05.24
a cluster destroyed or there was this battle.

1817
02:10:05.24 --> 02:10:10.76
Like, no, if you hear that story, it wasn't a fight to the death.

1818
02:10:10.76 --> 02:10:19.52
It was a slow, just crumbling away of their culture, the way they had it.

1819
02:10:19.52 --> 02:10:25.64
And from a perspective of, I mean, another lesson that can be taken away from this,

1820
02:10:25.64 --> 02:10:28.16
that's, you know, we talked about this all the time.

1821
02:10:28.16 --> 02:10:30.68
That was a, it's a form of negotiation, right?

1822
02:10:30.68 --> 02:10:33.52
Lesson, hey, don't worry about just come a little bit further.

1823
02:10:33.52 --> 02:10:37.12
You know, just move a little bit further down the path, move a little bit further down

1824
02:10:37.12 --> 02:10:38.52
the path.

1825
02:10:38.52 --> 02:10:45.12
And yeah, that's what, that's my point is be careful and pay attention to what you're

1826
02:10:45.12 --> 02:10:51.92
giving up from your, from your individual life and from your culture as a group, right?

1827
02:10:51.92 --> 02:10:52.92
In America, right?

1828
02:10:52.92 --> 02:10:55.72
I'm speaking now from my culture as an American.

1829
02:10:55.72 --> 02:10:56.92
That's our culture.

1830
02:10:56.92 --> 02:10:58.04
What are we going to give up?

1831
02:10:58.04 --> 02:10:59.20
Where is it going?

1832
02:10:59.20 --> 02:11:06.40
That's what we need to look out for because at some point we could look around.

1833
02:11:06.40 --> 02:11:10.48
And it's one thing if we don't have the culture anymore, we don't, we have a different

1834
02:11:10.48 --> 02:11:11.48
culture.

1835
02:11:11.48 --> 02:11:16.36
But the thing that I'm talking about, and it's okay for American culture to morph and

1836
02:11:16.36 --> 02:11:17.36
to grow.

1837
02:11:17.36 --> 02:11:18.36
That's okay.

1838
02:11:18.36 --> 02:11:25.44
But what I do, what we do have to watch out for is if we ever give up the strength

1839
02:11:25.44 --> 02:11:30.44
to defend ourselves and say, you know what?

1840
02:11:30.44 --> 02:11:32.48
Okay, you cross the line.

1841
02:11:32.48 --> 02:11:33.48
Yeah.

1842
02:11:33.48 --> 02:11:35.48
And we are not going to do what you're saying right now.

1843
02:11:35.48 --> 02:11:36.48
Yeah.

1844
02:11:36.48 --> 02:11:37.96
You know, that's what we need to be careful of.

1845
02:11:37.96 --> 02:11:42.24
We can never give up, you know, somebody asked me on Twitter the other day, you know,

1846
02:11:42.24 --> 02:11:46.80
in 140 characters, what should our foreign policy be?

1847
02:11:46.80 --> 02:11:49.56
And I did it in one word.

1848
02:11:49.56 --> 02:11:52.12
Our foreign policy should be strength.

1849
02:11:52.12 --> 02:11:53.12
Yeah.

1850
02:11:53.12 --> 02:11:54.48
Strength should be our foreign policy.

1851
02:11:54.48 --> 02:11:56.92
We should be strong.

1852
02:11:56.92 --> 02:12:02.52
And I'm telling you right now, and we've talked about this before, when you are strong

1853
02:12:02.52 --> 02:12:08.28
and you can defend yourself and you know that you can handle any problem that comes

1854
02:12:08.28 --> 02:12:10.64
your way, you're not going to have many problems.

1855
02:12:10.64 --> 02:12:11.64
Right?

1856
02:12:11.64 --> 02:12:12.88
It's not going to happen.

1857
02:12:12.88 --> 02:12:14.68
It's when you're weak.

1858
02:12:14.68 --> 02:12:16.84
It's when you let your guard down.

1859
02:12:16.84 --> 02:12:19.04
That's when you have problems.

1860
02:12:19.04 --> 02:12:20.04
Yeah.

1861
02:12:20.04 --> 02:12:26.20
And strength, essentially, capability, right?

1862
02:12:26.20 --> 02:12:27.20
That's what I'm not saying.

1863
02:12:27.20 --> 02:12:29.44
I'm not talking about the foreign policy thing at all.

1864
02:12:29.44 --> 02:12:31.28
You go down that path with me.

1865
02:12:31.28 --> 02:12:32.28
No, I mean.

1866
02:12:32.28 --> 02:12:33.28
Not now.

1867
02:12:33.28 --> 02:12:34.28
But, okay.

1868
02:12:34.28 --> 02:12:37.32
So, you know, like, crossfit, for example.

1869
02:12:37.32 --> 02:12:38.32
Right.

1870
02:12:38.32 --> 02:12:39.32
Oh, yeah, okay.

1871
02:12:39.32 --> 02:12:41.04
Well, by strength, I don't just mean strength.

1872
02:12:41.04 --> 02:12:42.32
Of course, I mean, that's what I mean.

1873
02:12:42.32 --> 02:12:44.32
Can't the ability to escape this.

1874
02:12:44.32 --> 02:12:45.32
Yes.

1875
02:12:45.32 --> 02:12:46.32
I stand corrected.

1876
02:12:46.32 --> 02:12:47.32
No, yeah.

1877
02:12:47.32 --> 02:12:48.32
No, I didn't mean to correct.

1878
02:12:48.32 --> 02:12:49.32
Of course.

1879
02:12:49.32 --> 02:12:51.92
I mean, like, I'm contributing.

1880
02:12:51.92 --> 02:12:52.92
Yeah.

1881
02:12:52.92 --> 02:12:53.92
I'm contributing.

1882
02:12:53.92 --> 02:12:54.92
But, you know how, okay.

1883
02:12:54.92 --> 02:12:58.84
So, I remember when crossfit exploded under the scene, people got real into it.

1884
02:12:58.84 --> 02:13:01.36
And sometimes people would get criticized.

1885
02:13:01.36 --> 02:13:03.64
And I said, man, you're doing this all this crazy work.

1886
02:13:03.64 --> 02:13:05.08
You're just getting good at working out.

1887
02:13:05.08 --> 02:13:07.28
Like, you're trying to get into this crazy shape for nothing.

1888
02:13:07.28 --> 02:13:08.72
Like, what are you training for?

1889
02:13:08.72 --> 02:13:09.72
You're not training for support.

1890
02:13:09.72 --> 02:13:10.72
You're just training.

1891
02:13:10.72 --> 02:13:14.000
I mean, I'm sure you could actually say, it could kind of be said about you.

1892
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.84
You're waking up every day, training a hard life for what?

1893
02:13:16.84 --> 02:13:18.28
And you're like for life.

1894
02:13:18.28 --> 02:13:19.28
Yeah.

1895
02:13:19.28 --> 02:13:20.28
Right.

1896
02:13:20.28 --> 02:13:22.28
So, you're training for capability.

1897
02:13:22.28 --> 02:13:23.28
I'm capable.

1898
02:13:23.28 --> 02:13:26.08
Are you capable?

1899
02:13:26.08 --> 02:13:28.92
And what level of capability do you have?

1900
02:13:28.92 --> 02:13:34.24
So people who've spent like a, and this by no means is any kind of judgment.

1901
02:13:34.24 --> 02:13:40.68
But if you've spent your life neglecting your health or your capability, you know,

1902
02:13:40.68 --> 02:13:42.36
you can be less well off.

1903
02:13:42.36 --> 02:13:44.44
You're not going to be very well off.

1904
02:13:44.44 --> 02:13:48.40
So with that, there is that caution.

1905
02:13:48.40 --> 02:13:50.20
Like, this is the tail of a cautionary tail.

1906
02:13:50.20 --> 02:13:55.28
One of the many probably over here, straight where if you are capable.

1907
02:13:55.28 --> 02:14:00.52
If it doesn't seem like your environment is testing that capability, bro, watch out.

1908
02:14:00.52 --> 02:14:01.52
Yes.

1909
02:14:01.52 --> 02:14:02.52
Yes.

1910
02:14:02.52 --> 02:14:03.52
Test the capability yourself.

1911
02:14:03.52 --> 02:14:04.52
Yeah.

1912
02:14:04.52 --> 02:14:07.24
Is it what you got to test the capability yourself?

1913
02:14:07.24 --> 02:14:12.000
That's good thing to end about spending too, because that whole system, this system.

1914
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:17.76
But especially now, like I said, life is luxury right now for us.

1915
02:14:17.76 --> 02:14:21.76
Where you can, back in the day, you're hunting for food.

1916
02:14:21.76 --> 02:14:22.76
You're a starvation here.

1917
02:14:22.76 --> 02:14:24.24
It's like too much, for example.

1918
02:14:24.24 --> 02:14:25.56
I want to hear examples from before.

1919
02:14:25.56 --> 02:14:26.72
So it's like it's luxury.

1920
02:14:26.72 --> 02:14:29.72
So even like consumption, right?

1921
02:14:29.72 --> 02:14:31.72
What do you spend your money on?

1922
02:14:31.72 --> 02:14:32.72
You know?

1923
02:14:32.72 --> 02:14:40.16
Spend money on entertainment, seems not really in line with improving your capability.

1924
02:14:40.16 --> 02:14:42.68
You know, like that's what I remember when we moved.

1925
02:14:42.68 --> 02:14:46.16
I was like, I want to get a home gym.

1926
02:14:46.16 --> 02:14:48.68
And it was pretty expensive, like what I wanted.

1927
02:14:48.68 --> 02:14:51.08
But it was easily justifiable.

1928
02:14:51.08 --> 02:14:52.08
Yeah, absolutely.

1929
02:14:52.08 --> 02:14:56.20
Because and I wasn't thinking in these specific terms, but really basically that's what

1930
02:14:56.20 --> 02:14:57.20
I was thinking.

1931
02:14:57.20 --> 02:14:58.20
Like this is going to help me in life.

1932
02:14:58.20 --> 02:14:59.20
Who's going to be?

1933
02:14:59.20 --> 02:15:00.20
For sure.

1934
02:15:00.20 --> 02:15:02.16
It helped me be more capable.

1935
02:15:02.16 --> 02:15:03.16
Way more.

1936
02:15:03.16 --> 02:15:04.16
And I already had a gym membership.

1937
02:15:04.16 --> 02:15:06.000
But you want the home gym.

1938
02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:07.000
You want the home gym.

1939
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
You can be even more capable overall.

1940
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I'm just saying.

1941
02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.52
So if, you know, like a lot of times that alone can justify like certain types of consumption.

1942
02:15:15.52 --> 02:15:16.52
For sure.

1943
02:15:16.52 --> 02:15:18.52
Yeah, if you're, yeah, absolutely.

1944
02:15:18.52 --> 02:15:22.04
I don't even think when it comes to me to spend making expenditure.

1945
02:15:22.04 --> 02:15:24.04
There's on things that are going to make me better.

1946
02:15:24.04 --> 02:15:25.04
Yeah.

1947
02:15:25.04 --> 02:15:26.04
Yeah.

1948
02:15:26.04 --> 02:15:27.04
There's not even, like, I don't hesitate on those things.

1949
02:15:27.04 --> 02:15:28.04
I hold a trigger.

1950
02:15:28.04 --> 02:15:29.04
Yeah.

1951
02:15:29.04 --> 02:15:30.04
I make it happen.

1952
02:15:30.04 --> 02:15:31.04
Yeah.

1953
02:15:31.04 --> 02:15:32.04
Play around.

1954
02:15:32.04 --> 02:15:32.04
Yeah.

1955
02:15:32.04 --> 02:15:33.04
Do not play around.

1956
02:15:33.04 --> 02:15:37.04
And I've been known to be pretty tight with my money.

1957
02:15:37.04 --> 02:15:38.04
Yeah.

1958
02:15:38.04 --> 02:15:40.04
But not when it comes to something that's going to make me better.

1959
02:15:40.04 --> 02:15:41.04
No, when it's so, yeah.

1960
02:15:41.04 --> 02:15:42.04
Yeah.

1961
02:15:42.04 --> 02:15:43.04
For sure.

1962
02:15:43.04 --> 02:15:44.04
Yeah, man.

1963
02:15:44.04 --> 02:15:47.04
Well, amazing book.

1964
02:15:47.04 --> 02:15:49.04
Amazing life.

1965
02:15:49.04 --> 02:15:53.04
I picked this book up on Amazon.com.

1966
02:15:53.04 --> 02:15:56.04
The book is called Wooden Leg, a Warrior who fought.

1967
02:15:56.04 --> 02:15:57.04
Custer.

1968
02:15:57.04 --> 02:15:58.04
Maybe later we'll do some more.

1969
02:15:58.04 --> 02:16:00.04
Maybe we'll do the other side of this battle.

1970
02:16:00.04 --> 02:16:02.04
And maybe get a little bit more into the battle.

1971
02:16:02.04 --> 02:16:05.04
Like I said, there's plenty of lessons learned from custer.

1972
02:16:05.04 --> 02:16:07.04
There's plenty of lessons learned there.

1973
02:16:07.04 --> 02:16:09.04
And there's a lot of controversy around it.

1974
02:16:09.04 --> 02:16:12.04
And that's why I tried to avoid the controversy.

1975
02:16:12.04 --> 02:16:17.04
I've tried to stick with just what's being said by Wooden Leg himself.

1976
02:16:17.04 --> 02:16:23.04
There's a lot of controversy about this battle and who did what and who is to blame and what mistakes were made.

1977
02:16:23.04 --> 02:16:26.04
And what I take from all those things, I'll learn from all of them.

1978
02:16:26.04 --> 02:16:28.04
I'll learn from every theory.

1979
02:16:28.04 --> 02:16:29.04
I'll learn from all of them.

1980
02:16:29.04 --> 02:16:30.04
That's my goal.

1981
02:16:30.04 --> 02:16:32.04
But we'll definitely get into that.

1982
02:16:32.04 --> 02:16:35.04
This book is just a great read.

1983
02:16:35.04 --> 02:16:38.04
The more you can fill your head up with different perspectives.

1984
02:16:38.04 --> 02:16:42.04
And the more you can pay attention to the Native American and learn more about their culture.

1985
02:16:42.04 --> 02:16:43.04
Awesome culture.

1986
02:16:43.04 --> 02:16:44.04
Warrior your culture.

1987
02:16:44.04 --> 02:16:45.04
Yes.

1988
02:16:45.04 --> 02:16:46.04
Warrior your culture.

1989
02:16:46.04 --> 02:16:46.04
Love that.

1990
02:16:46.04 --> 02:16:54.04
And like I said, you know, served with honor in all of our wars here, you know, which is,

1991
02:16:54.04 --> 02:17:00.04
we should probably do a whole podcast about Native Americans fighting in World War 2 and Vietnam.

1992
02:17:00.04 --> 02:17:03.04
And in the current conflicts we have.

1993
02:17:03.04 --> 02:17:08.04
So you can pick that up on Amazon on the inner webs.

1994
02:17:08.04 --> 02:17:13.04
And if you want to help the podcast, you can actually do a little click through of Amazon.

1995
02:17:13.04 --> 02:17:18.04
Yeah, I was going to say, I'll put that book link on the website.

1996
02:17:18.04 --> 02:17:19.04
Click on it.

1997
02:17:19.04 --> 02:17:21.04
Take your right to the book.

1998
02:17:21.04 --> 02:17:27.04
And as far as Amazon goes in general, there's a click through on the website.

1999
02:17:27.04 --> 02:17:30.04
So it doesn't matter what you're going to buy correct.

2000
02:17:30.04 --> 02:17:31.04
From Amazon.

2001
02:17:31.04 --> 02:17:38.04
If you want to support the podcast, that's, you know, that's essentially what you want to invest three to five seconds.

2002
02:17:38.04 --> 02:17:40.04
Opening that page and clicking through.

2003
02:17:40.04 --> 02:17:44.04
Yeah, you want to support the podcast. That's a great way to know that it doesn't cost anything.

2004
02:17:44.04 --> 02:17:48.04
Yeah, getting in the game, making yourself awesome.

2005
02:17:48.04 --> 02:17:50.04
Everyone really more capable.

2006
02:17:50.04 --> 02:17:50.04
Yes.

2007
02:17:50.04 --> 02:17:52.04
Let's improve knowledge.

2008
02:17:52.04 --> 02:17:54.04
Yeah, all that stuff.

2009
02:17:54.04 --> 02:17:56.04
Yeah, click through Amazon boom.

2010
02:17:56.04 --> 02:18:00.04
Because the website click through and say the tier favorites.

2011
02:18:00.04 --> 02:18:03.04
It's a little trick, a little efficient trick support.

2012
02:18:03.04 --> 02:18:04.04
Actively.

2013
02:18:04.04 --> 02:18:05.04
Passive.

2014
02:18:05.04 --> 02:18:06.04
Yeah.

2015
02:18:06.04 --> 02:18:07.04
Real aggressive.

2016
02:18:07.04 --> 02:18:08.04
Aggressive.

2017
02:18:08.04 --> 02:18:13.04
Anyway, also speaking of making yourself capable.

2018
02:18:13.04 --> 02:18:16.04
Supplementation.

2019
02:18:16.04 --> 02:18:19.04
Man, I still haven't gotten.

2020
02:18:19.04 --> 02:18:20.04
Creole oil yet.

2021
02:18:20.04 --> 02:18:21.04
I'll make that order tonight.

2022
02:18:21.04 --> 02:18:22.04
But Creole oil.

2023
02:18:22.04 --> 02:18:23.04
There's no longer on me.

2024
02:18:23.04 --> 02:18:24.04
Yeah, it's on you now.

2025
02:18:24.04 --> 02:18:26.04
Yeah, yeah, we, you know, we took the steps.

2026
02:18:26.04 --> 02:18:27.04
Yeah, we're doing it.

2027
02:18:27.04 --> 02:18:28.04
Yeah, yeah.

2028
02:18:28.04 --> 02:18:29.04
Yeah, it's, well, it was always on me.

2029
02:18:29.04 --> 02:18:30.04
Let's face it.

2030
02:18:30.04 --> 02:18:32.04
It's fun to put it on your butt.

2031
02:18:32.04 --> 02:18:33.04
Nonetheless.

2032
02:18:33.04 --> 02:18:35.04
Creole oil is.

2033
02:18:35.04 --> 02:18:38.04
Would you say that's the main one?

2034
02:18:38.04 --> 02:18:39.04
Man, I've been.

2035
02:18:39.04 --> 02:18:42.04
I've been on Creole oil for a long time and I dig it.

2036
02:18:42.04 --> 02:18:43.04
Yeah, there it is.

2037
02:18:43.04 --> 02:18:45.04
Creole oil, warrior bars.

2038
02:18:45.04 --> 02:18:47.04
These are just ones I'm recommending.

2039
02:18:47.04 --> 02:18:48.04
Creole.

2040
02:18:48.04 --> 02:18:49.04
Just some text.

2041
02:18:49.04 --> 02:18:50.04
Get your text again.

2042
02:18:50.04 --> 02:18:51.04
Go to on it on it.

2043
02:18:51.04 --> 02:18:52.04
That comes lash.

2044
02:18:52.04 --> 02:18:53.04
That's for 10% off.

2045
02:18:53.04 --> 02:18:58.04
But if you didn't know what on it is, it's just the best supplement.

2046
02:18:58.04 --> 02:19:00.04
We'll just say that.

2047
02:19:00.04 --> 02:19:03.04
They have some other cool stuff on their two, but anyway,

2048
02:19:03.04 --> 02:19:05.04
that's the one.

2049
02:19:05.04 --> 02:19:06.04
Don't.

2050
02:19:06.04 --> 02:19:07.04
I think they have some new stuff coming out too.

2051
02:19:07.04 --> 02:19:09.04
We'll talk about that next time.

2052
02:19:09.04 --> 02:19:13.04
It's got to do a evaluation on that one.

2053
02:19:13.04 --> 02:19:16.04
But yeah, on it is don't.

2054
02:19:16.04 --> 02:19:20.04
And of course, subscribe to the podcast on iTunes.

2055
02:19:20.04 --> 02:19:22.04
If you haven't already.

2056
02:19:22.04 --> 02:19:23.04
Yeah, that's a good one.

2057
02:19:23.04 --> 02:19:24.04
And tell your friend.

2058
02:19:24.04 --> 02:19:25.04
Yeah, tell your friend.

2059
02:19:25.04 --> 02:19:27.04
And here's the tell all your friends.

2060
02:19:27.04 --> 02:19:28.04
Both of them.

2061
02:19:28.04 --> 02:19:29.04
Yeah.

2062
02:19:29.04 --> 02:19:30.04
To subscribe to the podcast.

2063
02:19:30.04 --> 02:19:31.04
Here's it.

2064
02:19:31.04 --> 02:19:35.04
It's, I mean, I guess it's kind of obvious for us to say,

2065
02:19:35.04 --> 02:19:37.04
Hey, tell your friends about our podcast.

2066
02:19:37.04 --> 02:19:38.04
You know, that makes sense.

2067
02:19:38.04 --> 02:19:46.04
But when you tell your friends about like, okay, so I'm a friend who has a friend.

2068
02:19:46.04 --> 02:19:47.04
Our friends, two of them.

2069
02:19:47.04 --> 02:19:48.04
They listen to his podcast.

2070
02:19:48.04 --> 02:19:49.04
Oh, it's going to be a good joke.

2071
02:19:49.04 --> 02:19:50.04
We need them for a long time.

2072
02:19:50.04 --> 02:19:51.04
They listen.

2073
02:19:51.04 --> 02:19:52.04
And then they tell their other friend.

2074
02:19:52.04 --> 02:19:55.04
I didn't know this, but I see on Facebook.

2075
02:19:55.04 --> 02:19:58.04
Thank you for telling me about Dr. Go podcast.

2076
02:19:58.04 --> 02:19:59.04
I had to, you know, all this stuff.

2077
02:19:59.04 --> 02:20:01.04
So these were people that know us, but didn't know about the podcast.

2078
02:20:01.04 --> 02:20:04.04
No, to be a well, no, no, to people knew us,

2079
02:20:04.04 --> 02:20:05.04
Newspotcast.

2080
02:20:05.04 --> 02:20:07.04
I'll be apparently had told some people he was,

2081
02:20:07.04 --> 02:20:08.04
Thank you.

2082
02:20:08.04 --> 02:20:10.04
I'm officially, here's the thing.

2083
02:20:10.04 --> 02:20:12.04
The more people who act like, I don't know,

2084
02:20:12.04 --> 02:20:14.04
take anything you talk about.

2085
02:20:14.04 --> 02:20:17.04
Extreme ownership will say anybody.

2086
02:20:17.04 --> 02:20:18.04
Good.

2087
02:20:18.04 --> 02:20:19.04
Good.

2088
02:20:19.04 --> 02:20:21.04
But just the concept of the extreme ownership.

2089
02:20:21.04 --> 02:20:22.04
Right.

2090
02:20:22.04 --> 02:20:27.04
You get somebody implementing extreme ownership by a factor of 10

2091
02:20:27.04 --> 02:20:29.04
percent in their life and they're in your life.

2092
02:20:29.04 --> 02:20:30.04
That's an improved life.

2093
02:20:30.04 --> 02:20:31.04
That is an improved life.

2094
02:20:31.04 --> 02:20:35.04
That's why you, I would say that's that reason alone is good

2095
02:20:35.04 --> 02:20:37.04
or even tell someone about the podcast.

2096
02:20:37.04 --> 02:20:38.04
Yeah, yeah.

2097
02:20:38.04 --> 02:20:42.04
I know, I mean, I hear from people that say the podcast has helped

2098
02:20:42.04 --> 02:20:44.04
them out greatly, which is the best,

2099
02:20:44.04 --> 02:20:46.04
it's why we're sitting here.

2100
02:20:46.04 --> 02:20:46.04
Right.

2101
02:20:46.04 --> 02:20:48.04
Because if all, if I didn't hear that from anybody,

2102
02:20:48.04 --> 02:20:50.04
if we got no feedback,

2103
02:20:50.04 --> 02:20:53.04
maybe we wouldn't be doing the podcast right now.

2104
02:20:53.04 --> 02:20:55.04
Maybe we wouldn't have to learn about one leg tonight.

2105
02:20:55.04 --> 02:20:57.04
Yep.

2106
02:20:57.04 --> 02:20:58.04
Yeah.

2107
02:20:58.04 --> 02:20:58.04
Okay.

2108
02:20:58.04 --> 02:21:00.04
So yeah, tell your friends about the podcast.

2109
02:21:00.04 --> 02:21:02.04
Yeah, get them in the game for sure.

2110
02:21:02.04 --> 02:21:04.04
And tell them about that YouTube channel.

2111
02:21:04.04 --> 02:21:05.04
The YouTube channel, right?

2112
02:21:05.04 --> 02:21:06.04
The YouTube channel.

2113
02:21:06.04 --> 02:21:07.04
YouTube channel is good.

2114
02:21:07.04 --> 02:21:10.04
I can put up videos almost on a daily right now.

2115
02:21:10.04 --> 02:21:11.04
Oh, wait, no, we don't.

2116
02:21:11.04 --> 02:21:13.04
We're working on a good one.

2117
02:21:13.04 --> 02:21:14.04
It's different.

2118
02:21:14.04 --> 02:21:19.04
Yeah, I'll see if I can't get it up in the next week or so.

2119
02:21:19.04 --> 02:21:20.04
But it'd be good.

2120
02:21:20.04 --> 02:21:24.04
And yes, I promise I'll put more videos on there.

2121
02:21:24.04 --> 02:21:25.04
Oh, promise.

2122
02:21:25.04 --> 02:21:26.04
Yeah.

2123
02:21:26.04 --> 02:21:27.04
You heard that folks.

2124
02:21:27.04 --> 02:21:29.04
I love him beyond just the podcast.

2125
02:21:29.04 --> 02:21:30.04
I promise.

2126
02:21:30.04 --> 02:21:32.04
There you go.

2127
02:21:32.04 --> 02:21:34.04
The vague promise, by the way.

2128
02:21:34.04 --> 02:21:37.04
I'll put more videos on that's at one.

2129
02:21:37.04 --> 02:21:38.04
Yeah.

2130
02:21:38.04 --> 02:21:40.04
Tell her you two videos.

2131
02:21:40.04 --> 02:21:43.04
And of course,

2132
02:21:43.04 --> 02:21:49.04
if you're into t-shirts, go to Jockels door or rashguards.

2133
02:21:49.04 --> 02:21:52.04
Who's the thing about the rashguards?

2134
02:21:52.04 --> 02:22:00.04
I'm not a scientist officially, but you know, the 19% improvement of performance.

2135
02:22:00.04 --> 02:22:05.04
If you wear the rashguards, that we, it's starting to look like that is factual.

2136
02:22:05.04 --> 02:22:06.04
Yeah.

2137
02:22:06.04 --> 02:22:07.04
Yeah.

2138
02:22:07.04 --> 02:22:10.04
So, what do you call it?

2139
02:22:10.04 --> 02:22:12.04
Not proven, but what do you call it?

2140
02:22:12.04 --> 02:22:13.04
Confirmed.

2141
02:22:13.04 --> 02:22:14.04
Confirmed.

2142
02:22:14.04 --> 02:22:15.04
UFC fighter.

2143
02:22:15.04 --> 02:22:16.04
Nine-year veteran.

2144
02:22:16.04 --> 02:22:17.04
UFC fighter.

2145
02:22:17.04 --> 02:22:18.04
Currently fighting.

2146
02:22:18.04 --> 02:22:19.04
In the UFC.

2147
02:22:19.04 --> 02:22:20.04
Confirmed.

2148
02:22:20.04 --> 02:22:21.04
Confirmed.

2149
02:22:21.04 --> 02:22:22.04
I don't get tell.

2150
02:22:22.04 --> 02:22:25.04
But if anyone can tell, he can tell.

2151
02:22:25.04 --> 02:22:26.04
Mediable.

2152
02:22:26.04 --> 02:22:27.04
Scientific.

2153
02:22:27.04 --> 02:22:28.04
Scientific.

2154
02:22:28.04 --> 02:22:30.04
Why don't you say his name?

2155
02:22:30.04 --> 02:22:34.04
Because while I'm saying this, I'm contemplating, should I say, name is coal miller.

2156
02:22:34.04 --> 02:22:35.04
Yeah, we know who it is.

2157
02:22:35.04 --> 02:22:36.04
The man, the coal.

2158
02:22:36.04 --> 02:22:38.04
Co-miller did confirm.

2159
02:22:38.04 --> 02:22:39.04
Yep.

2160
02:22:39.04 --> 02:22:43.04
That his due-jitsu was 19% better.

2161
02:22:43.04 --> 02:22:44.04
On the map.

2162
02:22:44.04 --> 02:22:45.04
Confirmed.

2163
02:22:45.04 --> 02:22:46.04
Confirmed.

2164
02:22:46.04 --> 02:22:50.04
And again, that's, you know, if you were going to be doing some kind of a scientific experiment, you'd want some kind of a doctor.

2165
02:22:50.04 --> 02:22:51.04
Yes.

2166
02:22:51.04 --> 02:22:52.04
You know, somebody with a PhD.

2167
02:22:52.04 --> 02:22:53.04
Some of them expert.

2168
02:22:53.04 --> 02:22:56.04
You got your expert right there.

2169
02:22:56.04 --> 02:22:58.04
You got coal miller.

2170
02:22:58.04 --> 02:22:59.04
Six jutsu by the way.

2171
02:22:59.04 --> 02:23:00.04
Yeah.

2172
02:23:00.04 --> 02:23:01.04
He's no one.

2173
02:23:01.04 --> 02:23:02.04
He sees it.

2174
02:23:02.04 --> 02:23:03.04
He feels 19%.

2175
02:23:03.04 --> 02:23:04.04
Yep.

2176
02:23:04.04 --> 02:23:05.04
Proof.

2177
02:23:05.04 --> 02:23:08.04
He's training with, he was training with a rolling.

2178
02:23:08.04 --> 02:23:09.04
Yeah.

2179
02:23:09.04 --> 02:23:10.04
There.

2180
02:23:10.04 --> 02:23:11.04
There.

2181
02:23:11.04 --> 02:23:12.04
There's a few people.

2182
02:23:12.04 --> 02:23:13.04
I trained with him one time in that.

2183
02:23:13.04 --> 02:23:14.04
And hotliner.

2184
02:23:14.04 --> 02:23:15.04
Yeah.

2185
02:23:15.04 --> 02:23:17.04
That was like the first time I ever went into a place.

2186
02:23:17.04 --> 02:23:18.04
And I walked in.

2187
02:23:18.04 --> 02:23:19.04
I was like, hey man, I just want to train.

2188
02:23:19.04 --> 02:23:21.04
And he looks like, oh, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling,

2189
02:23:21.04 --> 02:23:22.04
Kornier, I think.

2190
02:23:22.04 --> 02:23:24.04
And he's in UFC too.

2191
02:23:24.04 --> 02:23:26.04
But I should get his hand.

2192
02:23:26.04 --> 02:23:28.04
And this was like 10 years ago or something.

2193
02:23:28.04 --> 02:23:29.04
I should get his hand.

2194
02:23:29.04 --> 02:23:30.04
I was like, hey man, good to meet you.

2195
02:23:30.04 --> 02:23:31.04
I'm just here to train.

2196
02:23:31.04 --> 02:23:32.04
Can I train on your mats?

2197
02:23:32.04 --> 02:23:33.04
And he's like, yeah.

2198
02:23:33.04 --> 02:23:34.04
Are you a back belt?

2199
02:23:34.04 --> 02:23:35.04
He asked me that.

2200
02:23:35.04 --> 02:23:37.04
And I was like, yeah, yeah.

2201
02:23:37.04 --> 02:23:38.04
I am.

2202
02:23:38.04 --> 02:23:39.04
I don't know how he could tell.

2203
02:23:39.04 --> 02:23:40.04
Right.

2204
02:23:40.04 --> 02:23:41.04
But he just told you do.

2205
02:23:41.04 --> 02:23:42.04
Yeah.

2206
02:23:42.04 --> 02:23:44.04
He's like, your back belt is a, yeah, man.

2207
02:23:44.04 --> 02:23:45.04
My back belt.

2208
02:23:45.04 --> 02:23:46.04
Let's do this.

2209
02:23:46.04 --> 02:23:47.04
But he's a awesome guy too.

2210
02:23:47.04 --> 02:23:48.04
Man.

2211
02:23:48.04 --> 02:23:49.04
I'm a super nice guy.

2212
02:23:49.04 --> 02:23:52.04
But hopefully maybe we need to get him a rash card too.

2213
02:23:52.04 --> 02:23:53.04
Yeah, man.

2214
02:23:53.04 --> 02:23:56.04
And that's not just for GGT, that's for, you know, whatever.

2215
02:23:56.04 --> 02:24:00.04
Any physical activity that you need some, some, what he called range of motion.

2216
02:24:00.04 --> 02:24:01.04
Mm-hmm.

2217
02:24:01.04 --> 02:24:03.04
That that if that means something to you get the rash card.

2218
02:24:03.04 --> 02:24:04.04
It looks dope too.

2219
02:24:04.04 --> 02:24:10.04
For people who have a certain level of aesthetic standard for those of you that care.

2220
02:24:10.04 --> 02:24:11.04
Yeah, about that kind of stuff.

2221
02:24:11.04 --> 02:24:12.04
I know.

2222
02:24:12.04 --> 02:24:13.04
Yeah, you know, you're here to win.

2223
02:24:13.04 --> 02:24:14.04
Yeah.

2224
02:24:14.04 --> 02:24:15.04
Yeah.

2225
02:24:15.04 --> 02:24:19.04
I mean, I did it, man.

2226
02:24:19.04 --> 02:24:21.04
I did it in respect for that.

2227
02:24:21.04 --> 02:24:24.04
But in the event of you caring what you look like.

2228
02:24:24.04 --> 02:24:27.04
We've got many, many compliments on the look of the rash card.

2229
02:24:27.04 --> 02:24:28.04
So just look at it.

2230
02:24:28.04 --> 02:24:30.04
Jockels store.com.

2231
02:24:30.04 --> 02:24:32.04
If you look at the rash card, look at the shirts.

If you like them, go ahead get one.

2233
02:24:34.04 --> 02:24:35.04
You can support that way.

2234
02:24:35.04 --> 02:24:36.04
Yeah, that's good.

2235
02:24:36.04 --> 02:24:37.04
Then they gave him.

2236
02:24:37.04 --> 02:24:38.04
You don't need to donate money.

2237
02:24:38.04 --> 02:24:39.04
Just look at them.

2238
02:24:39.04 --> 02:24:41.04

2239
02:24:41.04 --> 02:24:42.04
There you go.

2240
02:24:42.04 --> 02:24:43.04
Well, if you get one, you got a buy one.

2241
02:24:43.04 --> 02:24:44.04
Of course, but I'm just saying.

2242
02:24:44.04 --> 02:24:45.04
Okay.

2243
02:24:45.04 --> 02:24:47.04
If you like, how they looked in the boom,

2244
02:24:47.04 --> 02:24:48.04

2245
02:24:48.04 --> 02:24:50.04

Go ahead and do that, right?

2247
02:24:52.04 --> 02:24:54.04
Or if you just straight up need 19% improvement in your juice.

2248
02:24:54.04 --> 02:24:55.04
You gave them to get one.

2249
02:24:55.04 --> 02:24:57.04
Or if you just need a t-shirt.

2250
02:24:57.04 --> 02:24:58.04
But that's true.

2251
02:24:58.04 --> 02:24:59.04
Oh, we have hoodies too.

2252
02:24:59.04 --> 02:25:01.04
By the way, coming out one, two weeks, two more weeks.

2253
02:25:01.04 --> 02:25:02.04
One more week?

2254
02:25:02.04 --> 02:25:03.04
Whatever.

2255
02:25:03.04 --> 02:25:04.04
I'm gonna light it with a good one.

2256
02:25:04.04 --> 02:25:05.04
For these.

2257
02:25:05.04 --> 02:25:06.04
All right.

2258
02:25:06.04 --> 02:25:08.04
Yeah, some patches coming out to you some velcro stuff.

2259
02:25:08.04 --> 02:25:10.04
Just, yeah, there's some good stuff on there.

2260
02:25:10.04 --> 02:25:11.04
Check it out if you like.

2261
02:25:11.04 --> 02:25:12.04
Cool.

2262
02:25:12.04 --> 02:25:14.04
You might have some tea.

2263
02:25:14.04 --> 02:25:15.04
I know.

2264
02:25:15.04 --> 02:25:17.04
We do have, we do have Jocquay tea.

2265
02:25:17.04 --> 02:25:23.04
And I'm gonna tell you, we didn't expect Jocquay tea to sell like crazy.

2266
02:25:23.04 --> 02:25:24.04
No, I'm gonna look at this.

2267
02:25:24.04 --> 02:25:27.04
But it's so, you guys all that are listening this.

2268
02:25:27.04 --> 02:25:28.04
You guys got after it.

2269
02:25:28.04 --> 02:25:29.04
And all the way tea is gone.

2270
02:25:29.04 --> 02:25:32.04
Luckily, I apologize for that number one.

2271
02:25:32.04 --> 02:25:36.04
And you know what, they took it completely off a Amazon.

2272
02:25:36.04 --> 02:25:37.04
They pulled it down.

2273
02:25:37.04 --> 02:25:38.04
Yeah.

2274
02:25:38.04 --> 02:25:41.04
I just went to, because I was gonna, I was gonna tweet out some of the awesome reviews.

2275
02:25:41.04 --> 02:25:42.04
Did it got, yeah.

2276
02:25:42.04 --> 02:25:43.04
Sorry.

2277
02:25:43.04 --> 02:25:46.04
Like people that are now dead lifting 8,000 pounds by the way.

2278
02:25:46.04 --> 02:25:49.04
No, it's the fact, guys review it.

2279
02:25:49.04 --> 02:25:58.04
Yeah, he said he is, his deadlift went from 405, you know, 405 pounds to 8,000 pounds with Jocquay tea.

2280
02:25:58.04 --> 02:25:59.04
So there you have it.

2281
02:25:59.04 --> 02:26:01.04
That's worth it in his own right.

2282
02:26:01.04 --> 02:26:03.04
So you know, you always say, on its supplementation is good.

2283
02:26:03.04 --> 02:26:08.04
I don't see if, you know, a 7,500 pound improvement.

2284
02:26:08.04 --> 02:26:14.04
So yeah, so the Jocquay tea is sold out right now, but by the, well, there's more coming.

2285
02:26:14.04 --> 02:26:19.04
And depending on when you're listening this, this is, what is today October 15th?

2286
02:26:19.04 --> 02:26:22.04
Yes, it's October 15th.

2287
02:26:22.04 --> 02:26:23.04
So right now it's sold out.

2288
02:26:23.04 --> 02:26:25.04
It'll be back in full stock.

2289
02:26:25.04 --> 02:26:37.04
And not only do we have the 10, the deluxe 10 that you can buy, but in, you're going to also be able to buy a reload just a box with a 100 pound in there.

2290
02:26:37.04 --> 02:26:41.04
And some people, someone wrote a bad review on Amazon.

2291
02:26:41.04 --> 02:26:42.04
Good.

2292
02:26:42.04 --> 02:26:45.04
And they said, hey, your price is too high.

2293
02:26:45.04 --> 02:26:51.04
Bro, I love, I love the podcast, but you can't sell me this Jocquay tea for this amount of money.

2294
02:26:51.04 --> 02:26:52.04
That's not cool.

2295
02:26:52.04 --> 02:26:55.04
And so I talked to my tea people.

2296
02:26:55.04 --> 02:26:55.04
Sure.

2297
02:26:55.04 --> 02:26:57.04
And I said, tea people.

2298
02:26:57.04 --> 02:26:59.04
Emily, our price is too high.

2299
02:26:59.04 --> 02:27:00.04
What are we going to do about this?

2300
02:27:00.04 --> 02:27:06.04
And she said, well, your price is high because you wanted to get this special, hard core 10 to serve it in.

2301
02:27:06.04 --> 02:27:11.04
And I was like, well, yeah, because we make, you know, we believe in quality, right?

2302
02:27:11.04 --> 02:27:12.04
Sure.

2303
02:27:12.04 --> 02:27:14.04
And so we want to have something that is like tough.

2304
02:27:14.04 --> 02:27:15.04
So we got the 10.

2305
02:27:15.04 --> 02:27:27.04
And she said, well, that 10 cost a bunch of money to make and get sent over here and all this other stuff and I said, okay, well, how can we make a cheaper so we got a box with a 100 in it up the volume lower the price.

2306
02:27:27.04 --> 02:27:33.04
So now no one's going to be able to complain about the price because it's going to be on a par with any other white tea.

2307
02:27:33.04 --> 02:27:37.04
Except for it's going to make you be able to deadlift a thousand pounds.

2308
02:27:37.04 --> 02:27:38.04
Yeah, that's a winaway.

2309
02:27:38.04 --> 02:27:39.04
Which is definitely worth it.

2310
02:27:39.04 --> 02:27:41.04
I pay for premium price.

2311
02:27:41.04 --> 02:27:43.04
So it's good to go.

2312
02:27:43.04 --> 02:27:44.04
Yeah.

2313
02:27:44.04 --> 02:27:49.04
So check out the Jockel White tea and it's, it did sell out and read it sold out.

2314
02:27:49.04 --> 02:27:50.04
This costs people were buying it.

2315
02:27:50.04 --> 02:27:54.04
They bought one and then they bought five more because it's good to taste so good.

2316
02:27:54.04 --> 02:27:55.04
And people are drinking it.

2317
02:27:55.04 --> 02:27:59.04
Prejuge it to drinking it in the morning, drinking it before a test.

2318
02:27:59.04 --> 02:28:06.04
They're just drinking it all the time. It just tastes good. It replaces every other substance you need to drink.

2319
02:28:06.04 --> 02:28:08.04
Pretty soon.

2320
02:28:08.04 --> 02:28:13.04
So soon you're going to go out to a club and there's people going to be like, oh, get a good drink.

2321
02:28:13.04 --> 02:28:15.04
Sir, you're going to take a chocolate white tea.

2322
02:28:15.04 --> 02:28:17.04
Okay, they're going to have it on tap.

2323
02:28:17.04 --> 02:28:18.04
What's this?

2324
02:28:18.04 --> 02:28:19.04
Interesting.

2325
02:28:19.04 --> 02:28:20.04
You called the tin.

2326
02:28:20.04 --> 02:28:21.04
What do you call it?

2327
02:28:21.04 --> 02:28:22.04
Deluxe or luxury?

2328
02:28:22.04 --> 02:28:23.04
What do you call it?

2329
02:28:23.04 --> 02:28:24.04
Do you call it something?

2330
02:28:24.04 --> 02:28:24.04
Durable?

2331
02:28:24.04 --> 02:28:25.04
I saw you.

2332
02:28:25.04 --> 02:28:27.04
No, I think you said like luxury or something.

2333
02:28:27.04 --> 02:28:29.04
Premium.

2334
02:28:29.04 --> 02:28:30.04
Love.

2335
02:28:30.04 --> 02:28:31.04
I don't know.

2336
02:28:31.04 --> 02:28:32.04
Something like that.

2337
02:28:32.04 --> 02:28:34.04
We'll play back to tape nonetheless.

2338
02:28:34.04 --> 02:28:37.04
This is like a bunker more.

2339
02:28:37.04 --> 02:28:38.04
It's not like.

2340
02:28:38.04 --> 02:28:39.04
Oh, yeah.

2341
02:28:39.04 --> 02:28:42.04
Well, we don't make things really.

2342
02:28:42.04 --> 02:28:43.04
We'll call it a workforce.

2343
02:28:43.04 --> 02:28:44.04
That's a reinforced team.

2344
02:28:44.04 --> 02:28:47.04
And what's cool is guess what holds the pen on my desk now.

2345
02:28:47.04 --> 02:28:48.04
Yeah.

2346
02:28:48.04 --> 02:28:49.04
One of these.

2347
02:28:49.04 --> 02:28:52.04
Guess what holds a bunch of nails out my garage.

2348
02:28:52.04 --> 02:28:53.04
One of these.

2349
02:28:53.04 --> 02:28:54.04
That is hard.

2350
02:28:54.04 --> 02:28:56.04
Remember when I told you the other day, I like things that have dual purpose.

2351
02:28:56.04 --> 02:28:59.04
I'm going to do something else with it.

2352
02:28:59.04 --> 02:29:00.04
Yeah.

2353
02:29:00.04 --> 02:29:01.04
There you go.

2354
02:29:01.04 --> 02:29:03.04
Uh, there's a little book.

2355
02:29:03.04 --> 02:29:04.04
You can get it.

2356
02:29:04.04 --> 02:29:05.04
It's called a tree ownership.

2357
02:29:05.04 --> 02:29:06.04
It's about combat leadership.

2358
02:29:06.04 --> 02:29:10.04
If you liked the podcast, check out the book.

2359
02:29:10.04 --> 02:29:12.04
And also you can check out the audio book that

2360
02:29:12.04 --> 02:29:15.04
Lave Babin who wrote the book with me.

2361
02:29:15.04 --> 02:29:17.04
You, we read it.

2362
02:29:17.04 --> 02:29:19.04
So it's just more of us talking.

2363
02:29:19.04 --> 02:29:20.04
Check it out.

2364
02:29:20.04 --> 02:29:22.04
That's a tree ownership.

2365
02:29:22.04 --> 02:29:25.04
And also, of course, if you feel

2366
02:29:25.04 --> 02:29:29.04
like you want to keep talking to echo Charles and I,

2367
02:29:29.04 --> 02:29:31.04
you can believe it or not.

2368
02:29:31.04 --> 02:29:32.04
You can just do it.

2369
02:29:32.04 --> 02:29:33.04
You can talk to us.

2370
02:29:33.04 --> 02:29:34.04
We're there.

2371
02:29:34.04 --> 02:29:36.04
And we're on the interwebs.

2372
02:29:36.04 --> 02:29:39.04
And if you're on the interwebs and we're on the interwebs,

2373
02:29:39.04 --> 02:29:40.04
that means we can communicate.

2374
02:29:40.04 --> 02:29:42.04
Little thing called Twitter.

2375
02:29:42.04 --> 02:29:44.04
On Twitter.

2376
02:29:44.04 --> 02:29:46.04
Echo is at echo Charles.

2377
02:29:46.04 --> 02:29:48.04
I am at Jocca Willink.

2378
02:29:48.04 --> 02:29:51.04
And remember when I said I was going to back off Twitter,

2379
02:29:51.04 --> 02:29:52.04
I've been home lying on Twitter.

2380
02:29:52.04 --> 02:29:53.04
Yeah.

2381
02:29:53.04 --> 02:29:56.04
I'm not going to be a journalist.

2382
02:29:56.04 --> 02:29:59.04
But I am just hammered when I get what I do is when I travel.

2383
02:29:59.04 --> 02:30:01.04
I travel.

2384
02:30:01.04 --> 02:30:02.04
I got a sitting in an airport.

2385
02:30:02.04 --> 02:30:04.04
No, I'm not going to walk around in circles.

2386
02:30:04.04 --> 02:30:06.04
I don't watch movies.

2387
02:30:06.04 --> 02:30:07.04
No.

2388
02:30:07.04 --> 02:30:10.04
I either read for the podcast or I hammered Twitter.

2389
02:30:10.04 --> 02:30:12.04
So yeah, that's what's going on.

2390
02:30:12.04 --> 02:30:15.04
That's good to do for obviously for obvious reasons.

2391
02:30:15.04 --> 02:30:18.04
But it kind of keeps you informed.

2392
02:30:18.04 --> 02:30:20.04
That's like, you know,

2393
02:30:20.04 --> 02:30:23.04
a lot of people follow you.

2394
02:30:23.04 --> 02:30:25.04
So if you get a certain amount of people following,

2395
02:30:25.04 --> 02:30:26.04
you can't respond to everything.

2396
02:30:26.04 --> 02:30:27.04
You can't read.

2397
02:30:27.04 --> 02:30:28.04
So a lot of times people will be like,

2398
02:30:28.04 --> 02:30:31.04
hey, let me hire someone to do that.

2399
02:30:31.04 --> 02:30:33.04
Yeah, or hey,

2400
02:30:33.04 --> 02:30:36.04
I'm not going to spend more time on there or whatever because I'm too busy.

2401
02:30:36.04 --> 02:30:38.04
So instead of just maybe,

2402
02:30:38.04 --> 02:30:41.04
they'll just be completely not shown.

2403
02:30:41.04 --> 02:30:43.04
Yeah, they'll post stuff and then just kind of be it.

2404
02:30:43.04 --> 02:30:44.04
That'll be it.

2405
02:30:44.04 --> 02:30:46.04
But Paul, you're in touch now.

2406
02:30:46.04 --> 02:30:47.04
You know what's going on.

2407
02:30:47.04 --> 02:30:48.04
Yeah.

2408
02:30:48.04 --> 02:30:50.04
I've got a lot of good feedback.

2409
02:30:50.04 --> 02:30:52.04
I got a lot of good questions.

2410
02:30:52.04 --> 02:30:53.04
Yeah.

2411
02:30:53.04 --> 02:30:54.04
Got a lot of good questions.

2412
02:30:54.04 --> 02:30:55.04
And so that's worth it.

2413
02:30:55.04 --> 02:30:56.04
So if you want to, yeah,

2414
02:30:56.04 --> 02:30:59.04
Twitter, Instagram, and that's a piece of book.

2415
02:30:59.04 --> 02:31:01.04
We're both on there as well.

2416
02:31:01.04 --> 02:31:06.04
And that is kind of where we're at with this whole gig.

2417
02:31:06.04 --> 02:31:09.04
Now,

2418
02:31:09.04 --> 02:31:13.04
I guess to close it out tonight,

2419
02:31:13.04 --> 02:31:17.04
since we don't have time for questions.

2420
02:31:17.04 --> 02:31:18.04
You know,

2421
02:31:18.04 --> 02:31:20.04
I just want to say thanks to everybody for listening.

2422
02:31:20.04 --> 02:31:21.04
Thanks for everybody.

2423
02:31:21.04 --> 02:31:22.04
All the feedback that you're giving me.

2424
02:31:22.04 --> 02:31:27.04
Hey, I'm here in so much from first of all,

2425
02:31:27.04 --> 02:31:29.04
military guys,

2426
02:31:29.04 --> 02:31:33.04
military service members that are out getting after it.

2427
02:31:33.04 --> 02:31:38.04
Guys overseas right now that are crushing the enemy.

2428
02:31:38.04 --> 02:31:39.04
Godspeed,

2429
02:31:39.04 --> 02:31:40.04
keep getting after it.

2430
02:31:40.04 --> 02:31:41.04
Stay aggressive.

2431
02:31:41.04 --> 02:31:43.04
Absolutely.

2432
02:31:43.04 --> 02:31:44.04
Stay safe.

2433
02:31:44.04 --> 02:31:48.04
To police officers, which I hear a ton from back here.

2434
02:31:48.04 --> 02:31:50.04
You guys, thanks for what you do.

2435
02:31:50.04 --> 02:31:51.04
Thanks for keeping us safe.

2436
02:31:51.04 --> 02:31:54.04
I can't even imagine having that job to be honest with you.

2437
02:31:54.04 --> 02:31:56.04
I can't imagine having that job.

2438
02:31:56.04 --> 02:31:58.04
I don't have the temperament for that job.

2439
02:31:58.04 --> 02:32:00.04
It's not, it's not for me.

2440
02:32:00.04 --> 02:32:02.04
And for those of you that do that job,

2441
02:32:02.04 --> 02:32:03.04
stay strong.

2442
02:32:03.04 --> 02:32:05.04
I know it's hard times right now.

2443
02:32:05.04 --> 02:32:06.04
A lot of risk out there.

2444
02:32:06.04 --> 02:32:08.04
A lot of aggressiveness of you guys are,

2445
02:32:08.04 --> 02:32:09.04
you know,

2446
02:32:09.04 --> 02:32:11.04
extremely precarious position.

2447
02:32:11.04 --> 02:32:13.04
Every single day,

2448
02:32:13.04 --> 02:32:14.04
by the way,

2449
02:32:14.04 --> 02:32:15.04
every single call,

2450
02:32:15.04 --> 02:32:17.04
every single moment.

2451
02:32:17.04 --> 02:32:19.04
So,

2452
02:32:19.04 --> 02:32:21.04
thank you for what you do.

2453
02:32:21.04 --> 02:32:22.04
Firefighters,

2454
02:32:22.04 --> 02:32:23.04
of course,

2455
02:32:23.04 --> 02:32:24.04
same thing.

2456
02:32:24.04 --> 02:32:25.04
You guys getting after it.

2457
02:32:25.04 --> 02:32:28.04
And just running towards fire,

2458
02:32:28.04 --> 02:32:29.04
right?

2459
02:32:29.04 --> 02:32:31.04
That's overcoming an instinct.

2460
02:32:31.04 --> 02:32:33.04
That's what you do for a living.

2461
02:32:33.04 --> 02:32:35.04
So thank you for what you do.

2462
02:32:35.04 --> 02:32:36.04
Then of course,

2463
02:32:36.04 --> 02:32:40.04
we have all the workforce out there.

2464
02:32:40.04 --> 02:32:45.04
That is building and creating things

2465
02:32:45.04 --> 02:32:47.04
and making things happen.

2466
02:32:47.04 --> 02:32:49.04
And you are grinding,

2467
02:32:49.04 --> 02:32:50.04
and you are building it,

2468
02:32:50.04 --> 02:32:51.04
you're a world,

2469
02:32:51.04 --> 02:32:53.04
and you're building our world.

2470
02:32:53.04 --> 02:32:58.04
And so thank you for doing that.

2471
02:32:58.04 --> 02:33:00.04
And of course,

2472
02:33:00.04 --> 02:33:02.04
and most important,

2473
02:33:02.04 --> 02:33:06.04
as you roll through,

2474
02:33:06.04 --> 02:33:10.04
and as you continue,

2475
02:33:10.04 --> 02:33:14.04
think about wooden leg,

2476
02:33:14.04 --> 02:33:17.04
think about living hard,

2477
02:33:17.04 --> 02:33:19.04
think about holding the line,

2478
02:33:19.04 --> 02:33:24.04
think about being vigilant,

2479
02:33:24.04 --> 02:33:27.04
and stay,

2480
02:33:27.04 --> 02:33:31.04
stay uncomfortable,

2481
02:33:31.04 --> 02:33:35.04
stay true,

2482
02:33:35.04 --> 02:33:39.04
and stay forward,

2483
02:33:39.04 --> 02:33:43.04
forward of the decay,

2484
02:33:43.04 --> 02:33:46.04
and you do that

2485
02:33:46.04 --> 02:33:49.04
by getting out there,

2486
02:33:49.04 --> 02:33:53.04
getting after it.

2487
02:33:53.04 --> 02:33:55.04
So, until next time,

2488
02:33:55.04 --> 02:33:59.04
this is echo and jockel,

2489
02:33:59.04 --> 02:34:06.04
out.
