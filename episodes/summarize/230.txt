but I'll put you in the waiting list for next year he's ghost he's ghost guys you know they're too close to Washington they gave us a fit in the beginning fast forward in January 1972 captain Smith cut the order top gun became a permanent detachment appearing in the rag organizational chart with a solid line instead of a dotted line connecting it to chicksmith's headquarters that little tweak to the org chart made all the different suddenly we were assured of adequate staffing equipment fuel and operating funds our program is free of its former parent organization and then it goes top gun goes to war yanky station 1972 on March 30th 30,000 north Vietnamese army soldiers supported by a hundred tanks acquired from red china invaded south Vietnam a few days later another 20,000 troops also supported by tanks struck south Vietnam from louse they were the vanguard of a communist army that would ultimately field 300,000 troops and 600 armored vehicles on May 10th present Nixon ordered the mining of high fong harbor and other Japanese or another north Vietnamese ports putting a stop to Soviet deliveries of migs and surface to air missiles meanwhile air force Marine Corps navy planes hammered north Vietnamese supply lines bridges collapsed under a barrage of first generation smart weapons including laser guided bombs delivered by navy grum and a six intruders in a seven course air twos air force b 52 strato forces strato fortresses struck mega airfields around hanoi the enemy tried to defend these important targets flying make 21 and make 19 interceptors the north Vietnamese pilots found themselves in wild dog fights with US air force fanom's on May 10th 3,000,000,000,000 went down to air to air missiles but the north Vietnamese pilots scored two kills the air force continued to use old style world war two air tactics that we found so limiting the navy was on a different path the north Vietnamese makes encountered a new navy the alpha strikes included electronic countermeasure aircraft that jam the radio frequencies of the north Vietnamese pilots they ran into top gun trained pilots the tactics we developed at Miramar changed the game altogether and look this there's a section of the book that i'm not going to read right now because people just need to get the book and read it Jerry and his Rios Steve Barkley were idling their F4J standing on the catapult in a alert five status ready for quick launch when the radar control ship reported four bandits inbound toward the carrier that afternoon bollier and his air wing commander Paul Spear were launched off the constellations deck as the radar calls kept coming and the range closed they saw no sign of the mix the fanom pair pressed ahead it was bullier who first sighted the enemy fighters ahead and above him at about 25,000 feet following the loose doos doctrine Jerry alerted spear and took lead stoking his afterburners and accelerating into a climbing turn to intercept the two mixed spotted the Americans and separated the leader climbing and his wingman Blake breaking into a right turn bollier took the enemy wingman while Spear went after the leader as he closed with the number two mid bollier realized I suspect in the space of those first 20 seconds that his excitement had led him to stray from the proper technique he was fighting in the horizontal and climbing to engage his enemy directly he had lost too much airspeed to attack effectively he dove again to regain it pulling seven gs at the bottom he found the mid descending with him looking to avoid a turning fight he returned to what we had taught him he pulled up sharply sharply to initiate the egg maneuver rocketing vertically the mig had no chance to keep up meanwhile down below commander Spear had seemed to unnerve his own mig its pilot turned wide and left the fight Spear was turning back toward bollier to clear Jerry's tail when Jerry when Jerry's mig saw Spear the north Vietnamese pilot fired a heat seeking a toll missile at the approaching phantom the head shot the head on shot missed up and up bulliers phantom went with real barcly keeping him oriented telling him that the mig shooting at Spear was no threat Jerry focused on setting up his shot arcing over the top he saw that their opponent was vulnerable the mig had lost sight of him the enemy pilot banked right and then reversed sharply left as if looking for his pursuer this last maneuver was a fatal mistake it gave Jerry a clean shot up the enemy's tailpipe with the tone of a sidewinder lock buzzing in his helmet earphones he pressed the trigger and his missile left the rail it tracked true and exploded underneath the mig a shower of steel fragments sliced into the enemy plane and set it on fire trailing flames like a torch the mig sailed along rocking its wings bollier pulled up sharply to avoid running past him slid in behind him again and fired another missile this one finished him just like he had done in the drone shoot at top gun back on the deck of the constellation the celebration started immediately Paul Spear a large man gave diminutive Jerry a bear hug and lifted him off the top of his feet champagne strictly forbidden floed later that day a hanoi radio broadcast from the mig locked uh confirmed the mig loss in Washington the politics of peace talks forced the Pentagon to make smoke other than a brief announcement of a mig being downed the kill was said to have been scored by fanombs that were escorting a photo reconnaissance aircraft the navy kept a lid on the story back at Miramar we wondered who the mig killer was when it was finally confirmed that the mig killers were bowlier and barcly we were ecstatic it validated not only what we talk what not only what we taught but our schools very existence pretty awesome did you guys have any beverages when you found out and there's a lot of connections here top gun couldn't avoid a rival with the US Air Force there wasn't about politics to us it was about flying and ideas sure it bothered us to hear the Air Force claim it had created the first fighter weapon school it's bad ideas that lose wars and get people killed the most vocal advocate of the Air Force thinking at that time was major John Boyd in 1969 he was making a lot of speeches promoting his energy maneuverability theory of air to air warfare simply put it's a mathematical formula that tries to reduce fighter aircraft performance to a single value based on the plane speed thrust aerodynamic drag and weight first put forward in 1964 it had reportedly been used by the Air Force to design new fighters such as the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 fighting Falcon outstanding planes as we all know in 1969 Mel and Skye gave a talk at Tindle Air Force base in Florida John Boyd followed them pitching his theory there was some good debate and Mel remembers Air Force officers starting to challenge their catacysm in the Q&A major Boyd made an infamous remark he said that no US pilot should ever dogfight a MIG because his theory proved mathematically that since the enemy plane performed better throughout the flight envelope than the F-4 taking on a MIG was a good way to end up hanging from a parachute or a whole lot worse the problem with any theory is the baggage of its assumptions we thought major Boyd was making some rather large ones and considered his analysis suspect as a result in the base auditorium Tindle at Tindle that day Skye poked Mel in the ribs why don't you say something rattleer Mel stood up and proposed to the Air Force officer that he was underrating a few things namely people Mel said that while weapons might have parameters and airplanes theoretical values no algorithm could predict much if it excluded the most important factor of all the skill, heart and drive of the pilot in the cockpit. but the tactical switch provided stark testimony to which service they thought they could score against sadly the air force fought the 1972 air campaign essentially as it had rolling thunder and here in into the fluid for formation cost them air crews of the 51 aircraft that the air force lost during operation linebacker 22 went down to guns and missiles of north Vietnamese migs during the same time the navy lost just four birds to migs the Marines lost an f4 phantom to a mig and scored one in return from the start date of the top gun program to the end of the war the navy's overall kill ratio was 24 to 1 i mean that's just transformational transformational efforts on your part the rest of the top gun team the navy captain all for putting that report together the chain of command for actually listening and enacting these things it's a incredible history it was a good start and the big thing is the book represents 50 years we wanted in writing never been written before wanted in writing the legacy of how it got started and where really it's powerful it's a problem or other volumes that could be written from this goes out into the 70s 85 probably the last in this book you guys digs red butter all these guys over 50 years they were in the they were in the opposition and they fought their way through it we gave all their planes amongst mcun who was the co number four and it up giving me his rallies all they have a carrier plates during one of their when their fiasco's over in his room all their planes were given away Dallas Texas December 3rd and 4th go to extreme ownership dot com if you want to come we also have EF Overwatch and EF Legion listen if you are a vet if you're a veteran go to EF Legion right now

you can donate or you can get involved and if you want to hear more of my track honi and saliloquies or you want to hear you just can't get enough of echo Charles's fragmented diatribes or you just want to get a little bit more of good deal Dave Berks pure a tannical paragraphs you can find us on the interwebs on twitter on instagram and on facebook davis at david ar berk echo is at echo Charles and i am at jockel willink and thanks to all our service members out there who defend our freedom around the world with a special nod today towards our aviation communities pilots cruise maintenance personnel anyone else Dave that i missed that's it that's who keeps the birds in the fly keeps the birds flying keeps america dominating the air around the world obviously it was an honor to talk to Dan today we thank all of you for your efforts to preserve our air power in the same to our police and law enforcement firefighters paramedics emt's dispatchers correctional officers border patrol secret service thank you all for defending us here at home and also thanks to the doctors nurses and medical personnel who care for us when we need it most and to everyone out there remember what Dan Patterson learned in his life stay home test yourself take care of your people work together work together with your wingman and don't be afraid to bend the rules to push the envelope to take risks in order to be the best in order to be the top gun and until next time this is Dave Burke and echo in jackel out Sir Mel said I just don't think you know anything you can know anything about another pilot before the first turn and if you don't know that then you can't say that a MIG 17 will win every time that needed saying the best I can recall major Boyd didn't really engage you replied by restating his claim thank you for that view lieutenant but you can't fight a MIG in an F4 will lose wars that way we would see about that John Boyd was an intelligent patriotic and good at a great many things from this exchange we concluded that one of them was deriving big ideas that aspired to university but did not reckon with the human heart an aerial combat technical factors were important some of them could be modeled but no model could tell the whole story major Boyd was not wrong his theory was simply incomplete he also completely misjudged the F4 there were no slouches at science either we were no slouches at science either with cobra ruffleson's technical acuity and hard work we had fused hard data with equally hard experience it ended up showing exactly how a fandom could smoke a MIG almost every time the energy maneuverability theory had little to say about tactics or the people who made them work the pilot is a key part of the equation though it as a though as a variable it cannot be quantified out of mirror maras students and instructors bent the jet and flew beyond the limits we were trying to turn the man in the cockpit into a weapon as adversary pilots melski co-branash they didn't like that one bit and the guys guys fought their way through it 42 seals in order anyhow that's another well obviously got more books in yeah got a lot more books i got one got one work meanwhile this is an over yet you know you you say here home with my family for a rare Friday night this is 1973 hours barbeque mistakes thinking about taking an after dinner swim with the kids when the phone rang i went to pick it up sensing something was wrong as it turned out i was right the executive officer of fighter squadron 143 the pukenedogs was missing an action in south Vietnam that pilot hardly haul was a friend of mine the squadron was in a state of shock it also needed a new exo which accounted for my emergency orders to pack up within 20 hours and begin the long journey out to the enterprise you've been there you guys have seen that i'm sure but we broke with tradition the only reason he Air Force until after top gun got up and going they had Air Force fighter weapons school it knows for years gunnery and a few things but never in any like top gun now they have a red flag and the reason was the three star that they had run and things during Vietnam retired one guy held them back he mandated the flying wings thing spent time with robin holes you know the great general there's a guy i is a guy i lies talked to the links with robin holes and football games with them and and brought him down to fly with a smear mark on the Friday had a super happy hour that night with him and and uh and uh i watch his career in because of the mandated things the Air Force wouldn't change we never criticized them we didn't do anything they had and he just he couldn't he just so upset him there's a print of a man you know a lot of times I read books while in fact I only read books from people's first persons account of war because you know you I want people to understand what it's like to be there and one thing that you do in this book that you do very well is the way you connect the guys that are there with the overall picture and that's exactly what you did right here because so you've got Condor briefing the guys that we're leaving and then you go into this with the last flight to the midway from the embassy grounds 1,373 Americans in 5,595 Vietnamese were helicoptered to the naval task force another 65,000 fled by boat later to be picked up by one of the 40 ships offshore the fixed wing air crowd air lift from Tansong nut pulled out another 50,493 including almost 2700 orphans they were the lucky ones in the immediate aftermath of South Vietnam's collapse more than 150,000 civilians vanished most either executed outright or thrown into concentration camps and i think what was that mean was an air gunner he knew everything to do with a warner and some missiles on the air plane and uh and he held a new it all stand on his head he was that good but big talk good looking guy personality crazy everybody in this squad and loved him and one night and could be a could be point at the oh cup i got him only time i ever got him tell me any seal stories you know we have the air deals all wonder about you guys you know we really depressed and everything so you know as you were just kind of alluding to we get into what you title in the book proof of concept which is the guys are going to war and uh you you say here top gun students became crisp smart quick deadly and confident they knew the performance envelopes of their airplanes and missiles maneuver quickly to exploit them and handled all the switch interfaces in the cockpit efficiently they demonstrated their ability to fly the egg tactics to perfection and use the high yo yo out of a two plane loose douce formation to fill a and fry a grass or pilots almost every time out their final exam was a special retreat and unrestricted sparrow inside wind or shoot against live maneuvering targets that was Steve Smith we took him up to the civic missile range and took a BQM 34 which you know the good old American way would straighten leveled like shooting down an airline or and we found out that this damn BQM would out gee the airplanes particularly when it's controlled on the ground I mean the terminology is the same all the things he's talking about everything that that they are talking about has to stay into this day almost the exact same approach only anything changes is the opposition zero points your own airplane the weapon system that they're giving you to fly and that's therein lies the complexity of being a top-gun instructor because it's a constant dynamic they have got to work to stay ahead of the potential enemies if it'd be China if it'd be Russia everybody in the free world is working to keep their intelligence and their tactics revised if you will it's a full-time dynamic business hard work you say this about the loose doose the loose doose tactic reflected top-guns culture and this is why I called this out because it's not just the tactic that you use in the air which empowered junior officers to act and speak freely there was no leader wingman hierarchy in our tactics which left either fighter free to attack depending on who stage or depending on who cited a bogey first loose doose was a versatile and aggressive certainly was a far cry from the air force's tactic the fluid for which in spite of its adjective was quite rigid giving the initiative and most opportunities to the flight leaders life at top-gun was flight club every day as the instructors flew against the students it was natural for the students to want to take a scalp now and then if one of them beat Wrathler, Smash, Swatsky, Cobra, or me it could help his service reputation they seldom did it and oh god if I ever wanted anything in my flying bird I wanted a gun and a family never had a gun I know I could have won every fight with a gun gadlin gun this this concept of of the loose-dose formation you know even when you said mutually supporting you know in in ground tactics right we have the principle of cover move which means we're gonna work together when one person's moving the other person's shooting or you know keep in the enemy distracted but we all had wounds to heal as twenty minutes before the armances became effective the whole the an armor every fighter pilot wants a command of his own squadron i learned i was to become the skipper of the pukendogs again i'm fast boarding at at this point at i'm gonna jump to a part where you're heading to Las Vegas at the end of August for an enormous reunion of american aviators of all services who had phoned in Vietnam we would unofficially welcome back the 166 men taken prisoner by the north Vietnamese some three thousand of us and our wives gathered at the hilton there were many spontaneous many reunions that night as old friend saw each other for the first time and years the happiness touched everyone the war over the years of hardship and rear view mirror at last our former POWs were ready to pick up their lives and careers what an enormous challenge some came home knowing nothing of the summer of love the wats riots the ken state shootings or the assassinations of martin Luther King and robbered fkennity the last experience of america predated acid rock and woodstock fitting into the here and now and getting to know their families again tested the former POWs all over again and you and i were talking about Charlie plumb who's who's been on this a few times and just an unbelievable guy and every possible way and currently we let William reader who's been on here too as well also you know an army pilot and oh we like our patch so there's your answer you know one thing I want to jump through real quick as you mentioned a couple times the the fault the traits that you guys were you know putting forward as what a good pilot consists of you say a passion for the mission necessary to sustain the individual in an extreme environment leadership by personal example a compassionate inspirational person willing to take responsibility extraordinary airmanship required to operate in so unforgiving and environment humility derived from a sense of being part of something much greater than one self subject matter expertise that is beyond reproach a work ethic that will drive the person to do whatever it takes for however long it takes to ensure success personal discipline to endure the rigorous training and attention to detail required to constantly perform at an optimum level integrity adaptability innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo and last credibility established through demonstrated performance sustained over time now the only thing I don't like about those is it took me yeah the first first student grad shot it down first time out give us a little history on the patch the top gun patch I don't you know we we could take every night before and after we started working students at the club we just go and sometimes have beer to and I could take today's effort so the the the patch was designed at the old club by two of the guys Steve Smith could do anything I mean these guys are we should see where they are today in business but Steve and in millholzed signed a patch and we submitted it incidentally I never asked for permission ever in a front end of what we were doing no permission no letters of approval everything you know if we if they don't like the telltale's never had to get anything ask above me and it was it wasn't me it was nine of us the key elements what I talked about each guy bringing something special table there would not she didn't like this they they all had names and he knew him he knew him and rather than get brand new engines he said no i want these engines i want the same engines and the caveatie golf just like okay you want these old engines he said yes i do these are the ones that work these are the ones that i know the devil's the devil you know is better than the one you don't know And so even some of the same institutional things you dealt with and to be down there talking on my old squadron mates, doing type one gun runs in situations that I never thought I'd be and but how good it felt to do something to be honest, we didn't really want to be doing but to be down there and have guys that I knew from my old squadron is coming in doing gun runs and when those missions were over to go back and think man, like you said, I mean, the serious business, the fact that the Marine Corps let me do that, there was a lot of me that didn't really want to but that was the most powerful thing ever did in my 23-year career was use aircraft as fact to keep soldiers Marines and seals alive which to this day. and he came home in time for me to pull him into top gun as one of our instructors he subsequently went back to flight school became an F4 pilot and went through top gun as a student before heading out to the carrier USS coral sea and his first overseas deployment as a fighter pilot in 1975 he was a young lieutenant tasked with delivering one of the most painful briefs the squadron would ever receive it fell to Condor to bring them the news that we were abandoning our allies once and for all that's the only time I've ever seen him said I would say keg they are erwin commander about this guy do it actually when in flu cover over the healing copters and healing copters and watch the accident people going out both loads of people trying to get on the carriers and he came back and you got one of them and they still use those criteria in the selection and the instructors I'm not sure the guys know what they're getting into because the work load is crazy how hard they were from now well obviously it's a high standard and there's a reason for it like you said earlier you got people's lives in your hands that's right and you're right and besides that right now It's not a day even I and the rest of the guys in echelon front spend a lot of time talking about the fact that our combat experience is it's a real stretch to use the word combat experience when you compare it to a lot of the guys I've had on this podcast and a lot of, you know, and obviously hundreds of thousands of of service men and women that have done things infinitely, harder and more dangerous and with what much more sacrifice than anything that we did and that's why we just try and, you know, capture some of the lessons. and he'd go jump in it because he thought it was you know he'd count down the others number one there's number two I came in vehicle two well that that wasn't accurate and you'd have guys going to the wrong vehicles and so we ended up I said we're gonna name the vehicles and you're gonna know what vehicle you're in by name because that way hey if I came in big earn or whatever you know bigger and was the humvie I came in and I think for a lot of folks is how much more there is to be it is so rough it is so rough on the ego and so helpful for you as a human being get the code the evaluation is the protocol we got leadership strategy and tactics field manual we got way the warrior kit want to and three we got Mikey in the dragons discipline it was freedom field manual extreme ownership in the economy leadership I guess we're over here writing some books that's what it seems like to me right on if you want to get a little bit of reading done check out some of those books we also have echelon front which is our leadership consultancy where we solve problems through leadership whatever problems you're having in your organization they are leadership problems There are and actually people know this now because you know we have drones flying around and now that they fly drones all over the place, people are all shocked that there's a bunch of sharks out there like I'm a surfer and people are now realizing, oh there's sharks right off the coast of where we surf and you know I said the sharks have always been there. Hey, listen, yeah, don't take for one second that I want you to think that what that story just told was my life, please don't and don't think that anything we did was remotely comparable to you, you know, what the guys on case on and what the guys in Vietnam, you know, we, we, you know, just not comparable. We always, you know, you were talking about the, you know, air force helicopter pilots or, or for me, the Navy pilots were the best pilots we could get when I, when I first got in the Navy because those guys hovered at over, they hovered over these ships all the time. Google Play MP3 platforms you can get psychological warfare you can also get visual representations of that from flipside canvas dot com the codemire his company keeping it awesome some books obviously first and foremost we got Dan Pettersen's book top gun it will be available through jocco podcast dot com it'll take you the Amazon like we've got the code the evaluation the protocols they've worked how's your first experience being in the top charts of Amazon there it was awesome man it was crazy and the feedback that's coming in how do you feel about it I feel good about it the feedback's been really good and people are using it the way we hope they would and it's helping a ton of people stay in the game which is awesome when you read through it and you know how hard are you really hard to call was killed the exhaled the blue angels and on the way home we had just left pearl on the way home it stopped and pearl i get a message we need both your fighter squadrons on their prize want to turn around twenty or fifty one days we're gonna turn around send me east coast and deploy on the america for seven months now there's a leadership problem talk indeed jesus he's guys had just lost the best leader actually blu angel leader and he he could have been i'm telling the personally i knew him I just was a little too default aggressive just made the podcast got it out there turns out there was another podcast named the thread it's not mine they didn't like that very much so it has been revoked but I'm gonna rename it and we're gonna put it back out there I apologize for the pause in that podcast with Darrell Cooper so we'll get back out as soon as we can I got to think of what we're gonna call it and then get it up and out there we also have grounded podcast which is about jjitsu and the way jjitsu relates to everything that you do in the world we also have the warrior kid podcast for your warrior kids and while you're thinking of warrior kids you can support a warrior kid by going to irish oaks ranch dot com and getting some soap made from goat milk here in California by a young warrior kid making you products so that you can stay clean. and i got to say one last thing adherence to strict rules and restrictions meant almost certain defeat against well-trained pilots fighting under no such restrictions and this is why we at top gun never existed before we we at top gun we say top gun never existed before the navy set it up at Miramar no schoolhouse that required adherence to fixed ideas reduced airplanes to numbers or considered its instructors as priests could ever be top gun in our book from the final tallies over in Vietnam we would eventually learn to tell the tale you know what we ended up from the day top gun it started in the first class graduated to the end of the Vietnam war yeah after Vietnam there's a whole group of seals when they downside this downside is the seal teams there was a whole group of seals that they sent to the fleet and also it might have been because he was a warnafter because i don't know if they knew what to do with the warnafters back then in the inside the seal teams and they might have said oh you made a warnafter congratulations you're gonna go be a warnafter in the fleet could have been either one of those things uh if any of your listeners should know the worry about the warnafter bobcane no calling bobby and uh he was remarkable in his capacity as my gunner for two cruises and uh wrote to him for a couple years and lots of tight cuddling i think in pomey maybe still alive Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City a memorial to the unknown masses of dead somewhere between one and four million Vietnamese perished from 1955 to 1975 in Cambodia another 300,000 were killed Louseloss between 20 and 60,000 in the years ahead the killing would continue as communist and surgeons toppled the governments of Louseloss in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 the Commir Rouge a regime that swept to power in the wake of America's exit from the region murdered or starve to death about 2.5 million people out of a population of 8 million more than 30% of the entire nation when Americans look back at Vietnam we remember the domestic unrest we think two of the 58,000 names memorialized on that long black marble wall in Washington those are important to remember but few want to discuss the other consequences of America's lost war You know there's a lot of connections with a lot of different things and I've been recently talking to a guy who's connected to some people that were on this operation when the ship that named the My Guest how do you say it? i mean uh the it's what we sign up for but it doesn't make it easy it's harder and the family anybody you know you show up 24 hours later a navy sea two took me aboard at qb point foome out to the carrier the squadron seal gordon cornell met me on the flight deck gordo was a warrior's warrior a man who'd flown everything from f9 f panthers to f eight crusaders and f four phanams wounded an action over north Vietnam in 1966 he went on to earn two distinguished flying crosses and seventeen air metals really got glad to see you yank the um you you go into a great kind of detailed account of of the Israeli war and how you know you you already mentioned how uh how we were able to help out how top gun specifically was able to help out and and also the efforts of of the guys and the Israeli you know air force is that what is the Israeli air force? and uh we did get top gun at one time with mug's muckoo and gave my wire planes in order for their survival and that war i promise to take Bethlehem to Israel here as soon as we get rid of this lovely nightmare in right now guys go for one two long go and back to the book 40 miles off south Vietnam April 29th 1975 for naval aviation the problem of Vietnam never seemed to go away Lieutenant Darrell Condor Gary stood before the assembled pilots and reels of VF51 in Darrell's short career he'd been thrown into the air war over North Vietnam before completing his rag training back in the late 1960s as an F4 backseater two tours there
