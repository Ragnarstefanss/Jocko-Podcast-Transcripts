00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000 This is Jocopotcast number 176.
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000 Good evening, echo.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000 Good evening.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000 Usually, when I write a letter, it is very much overdue,
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000 and I make every effort to get it away quickly.
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000 This letter, however, is different.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000 It is a letter that I hope you would never receive
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000 as it is verification of that turse, black-edged card,
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000 which you received some time ago,
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000 and which has caused you so much grief.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000 It is because of this grief that I wrote this letter.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000 And by the time you have finished reading it,
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000 hope that it is done some good,
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000 and that I have not written it in vain.
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000 It is very difficult to write now of future things
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000 in the past tense, so I am returning to the present.
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000 Tomorrow we go into action.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000 As yet, we do not know exactly what our job will be,
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000 but no doubt, it will be a dangerous one
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000 in which many lives will be lost.
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000 Mine may be one of those lives.
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000 Well, mom, I am not afraid to die.
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000 I like this life, yes,
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000 for the past two years,
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000 have planned and dreamed and mapped out a perfect future for myself.
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000 I would have liked that future to materialize,
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000 but it is not what I will, but what God wills.
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000 Then if by sacrificing all this,
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000 I leave the world slightly better than I found it.
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000 I am perfectly willing to make that sacrifice.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000 Don't get me wrong, though, mom.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000 I am no flag waving patriot, nor have I ever profess to be.
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000 England's a great little country, the best there is.
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000 But I cannot honestly and sincerely say that it is worth fighting for.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000 Nor can I fancy myself in the role of a gallant crusader fighting
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000 for the liberation of Europe.
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000 It would be a nice thought, but I would only be kidding myself.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000 No, mom, my little world is centered around you.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000 It includes dad, everyone at home, and my friends,
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000 and Wolverhampton.
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000 That is worth fighting for.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000 And if by doing so, it strengthens your security and improves your lot
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000 in any way that it is worth dying for too.
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000 Now, this is where I come to the point of this letter.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000 As I have already stated, I am not afraid to die,
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000 and then perfectly willing to do so.
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000 If by my doing so, you benefit in any way whatsoever.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000 If you do not, then my sacrifice is all in vain.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000 Have you benefited, mom, or have you cried and worried yourself sick?
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000 I fear it is the latter.
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000 Don't you see, mom, that it will do me no good,
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000 and that in addition, you are undoing all the good work I have tried to do.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000 Grief is hypocritical, useless, and unfair,
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000 and does neither you nor me any good.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000 I want no flowers, no epitaph, no tears.
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000 All I want is for you to remember me and feel proud of me.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000 Then shall I rest in peace, knowing that I have done a good job?
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 Death is nothing final or lasting.
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000 If it were, there would be no point in living.
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000 It is just a stage in everyone's life.
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000 To some it comes early, to others late, but it must come to everyone's time.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000 Then surely, there is no better way of dying.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000 Besides, I have probably crammed more enjoyment into my 21 years than some managed to do in 80.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000 My only regret is that I have not done as much for you as I would have liked to do.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000 I love you, mom.
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000 You are the best mother in the world.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000 And what I fail to do in life, I am trying to make up for in death.
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000 So please don't let me down, mom.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000 Don't worry, or fret.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000 But smile.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000 Be proud and satisfied.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000 I never had much money, but what little I have is all yours.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000 Please don't be silly and sentimental about it.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000 And don't try to spend it on me, spend it on yourself or the kiddies.
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000 It will do some good that way.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000 Remember that where I am, I am quite okay.
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000 And providing I know that you are not grieving over me.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000 She'll be perfectly happy.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000 Well, mom, that is all.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000 And I hope I have not written it all in vain.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000 Good bye.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000 And thanks for everything.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000 You are unworthy son, E4.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000 And that was a letter from private E4, Roe Berry, who served in the British Army in the South
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000 Staffordshire Regiment and the letter can be found in a book called Last Letters Home.
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000 And it was his last letter home.
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:59.000 He was killed in Ochnem on 17 September 1944, in the opening action of Operation Market Garden,
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000 which was conceived in planned and championed by Field of Marshall Bernard Montgomery.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.000 And this massive operation overall, it's generally assessed as a failure.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000 Although history has been kind and some people look back and theorized that it did have a more positive impact on the battlefield
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:41.000 than was initially fought, but nonetheless, it didn't achieve objectives and there was a significant amount of casualties.
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000 And as I said, this was Monti.
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000 Monti's plan is the plan that he pushed.
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000 And as I said on the last podcast about him, this is one of the things that makes him controversial,
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000 that he led this operation, Market Garden.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000 And as I said on the last podcast, he was able to redeem himself somewhat in the battle of the bulge,
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000 but this negative was pretty impactful.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000 And with that, that doesn't mean that there's nothing we can learn from that situation.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000 And we covered it on the podcast, that battle from that perspective.
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000 And we have to learn from people's successes and people's failures just as we have to learn from our own successes and our own failures.
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000 And on the last podcast, we talked about Monti's in a few of leadership.
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000 And if you haven't listened to that podcast yet, it's number 174, that kind of talks a little bit more detail slightly about Monti and his thoughts.
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000 And we debated a little bit the meaning of the word dominate, which he kind of puts as one of these driving forces as a leader.
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000 As the leader's ability to dominate.
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000 And I talked about how I'm not quite sure where he falls with that word.
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000 You know, because dominate can have a very negative connotation.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000 And I actually asked for feedback and a bunch of people gave me feedback.
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000 And I think I landed somewhere kind of in the middle.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000 I don't think it's the dominate with the, with the, hey, I'm just going to roll over my people.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000 I don't think that's how we meant it.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000 I think he, but I don't think he meant it in like, hey, I'm just dominate.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000 I dominate my skills and that's why I'm good.
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000 I think he meant it somewhere in the middle.
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:43.000 And then I talked about the fact that one of the other major important factors that Monti talks about is morale.
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000 And he wrote another little thing about morale called morale and battle.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000 And I think I actually wish I would have covered this one first.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000 And this one almost trumps the leadership.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000 His thoughts on leadership, because I think this is even more applicable and relatable.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000 But it's, it's good solid stuff from someone that led massive numbers of troops in battle.
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000 And saw a lot of war in World War I and World War II, obviously.
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000 So with that morale in battle and we're going to jump right into it.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000 Here we go.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000 This paper is an attempt to analyze what is at the root of morale in battle.
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000 And thereby to discover how it can be developed.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000 Hymeral is defined as endurance and courage in supporting fatigue and danger.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000 In other words, the quality which makes men go forward in an attack and hold their ground in defense.
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000 It is the quality without which no war can be won.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000 So this is a, and I'll get to this in the end.
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000 He talks about morale being the most important factor on the battlefield.
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000 Obviously, I think leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000 And I'll break that down a little bit later, but from his perspective as a guy that had led massive operations.
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000 He feels morale is the most important thing.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000 So without a doubt, it is important.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000 Here we get into his thoughts on it.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000 And again, I think you're going to see this, the stuff that he talks about morale.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000 He seems to nail this.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000 I think even better than he nails leadership.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000 So here we go, the quality of morale in war, the moral stature of some men increases and their characters grow stronger and more close.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000 closely knit in proportion to the discomforts and dangers which they are called upon to face.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000 I said this over and over again.
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000 War.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000 War can make you stronger.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000 War can make you a better person.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000 This is something that Peter T. and I talked about when he first came on the podcast and we talked about.
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000 Families that were slightly fractured. If they have a major incident, a medical emergency, somebody gets wounded, somebody gets cancer.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000 If the family's close, it'll make them closer.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000 If the family's fractured, it'll blow them apart.
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000 He's saying the same thing here.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000 Back to the book, such men will occasionally perform in battle, remarkable acts of self-lish courage and daring and will endure with extraordinary fortitude and patience.
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000 The burdens thrust upon them.
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.000 Other men, however, will under the stress of hardships or dangers surrender to fear or fatigue and will allow their characters to disintegrate.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000 So the same thing that Peter T. was talking about with families and this is the same thing with any team or organization.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000 You have a team that's pretty close and they go through something rough. They get even closer.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000 You have a team that's kind of fractured and they go through something tough. They're going to explode.
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000 Same thing happens with people's personalities in character in war.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000 This disintegration is usually, will usually take the form of elucing of the moral fiber which results in timidity of action and slackness in appearance.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000 He talks a lot about appearance.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000 One of these guys.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000 In battle, men who have kept a firm grip upon themselves when a player will appear clean and vital in their appearance,
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000 while those who have gone to seed will be dirty and their appearance will be slobvenly.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000 So he's one of those guys.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000 Hey, if you don't look at this, obviously, this is the much of the military.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000 They will judge you on how you look.
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000 That's not always true. Sometimes you get a guy that looks like a rogue, street person.
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000 And he's a good operator.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000 And sometimes, not. It depends.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:57.000 Similarly, timid officers will be found during quiet periods in the line, grovelling in the filth of some seller,
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000 while their signalers and runners separated from the light, attempt to do their jobs by the flame of a guttering candle.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000 In these latter cases, there's been a general loosening of the character due to a partial surrender to fear.
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000 So you get these timid officers there out there and they cower and they're scared.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000 And they, while their troops are up, trying to do their job.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000 In extreme cases, men who have become afraid have sunk to the level of beasts.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000 No longer in full control of themselves. They have become as sheep or rabbits unable to act or loan or think rationally.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 Their instincts have become those of the herd.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000 They are either paralyzed by fear or gripped by un-reasoning panic, such manner exceptions,
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000 but they are a reminder of the value of high morale.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000 The good soldier, the man with high morale, has not surrendered to fear and has maintained his personal standards.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:06.000 The bad soldier, the man with low morale, has become incapable of dependent action of independent action
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000 and has to some extent shed a part of his human individuality.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000 So this is what you get. People had all freaked out and they don't act for themselves anymore.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000 They're just going to fall down hurt.
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:30.000 Moral is a mental and moral quality. It is a quality peculiar to human beings because it is essentially the product of a mind with a conscience.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000 It is that which in battle keeps men up on humanity's level, as opposed to being a beast.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000 But humanity's levels are not high enough because the strongest human instinct is the instinct of survival.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:55.000 Moral is also that which develops man's latent heroism so that he will overcome his desire to take the easy way out and surrender to fear.
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000 So you got to be a little bit beyond human because the human instinct, the strongest human instinct, is I, I'm just going to stay alive. That's my goal.
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000 You got to be more than that. You got to be better than that.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000 It is necessary now to make clear what high morale is not.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000 It is not contentment or satisfaction bred from ease or comfort of living.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000 Both of these contain a hint of complacency and acceptance of luxury as an and in itself.
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000 High morale is far more than any of these for it implies essentially the ability to triumph over discomforts and dangers and carry on with the job.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000 So if you're one of these leaders, you're in a leadership position and you think, well, you know,
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:52.000 how do I raise my morale of my men? Give them luxury days. Give them feel of on luxury days.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000 Theo negative not happening. That doesn't do it.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000 Back to the book. Nor is, no, because I'm sorry because what you have to do is you have to give them challenge. You have to give them discomfort.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000 Or you're not, not you have to give them. They have to face discomfort.
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000 They have to face danger. And that's what increases morale. When they face and they try them over that. That's what increases morale.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000 Pizza and fine satan sheets do not increase morale.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000 They might get a little surface nudge, but they don't increase morale.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000 Otherwise, your morale would be through the roof.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000 All day. So the morale is so it's like not to be confused because you do need like the rest between sets.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000 Yes, right. And that's different. And you can't just beat people down.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000 Right. Right. You can't, you can't, you know, you have to get sleep. You have to get rest. You have to have some level of comfort or your amount of morale will get beat down.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000 But that can't be the primary aim. Right.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000 Right. Right. If you as leaders to provide comfort. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like, hey, let's boost morale by letting people sleep or whatever. Right.
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000 And letting them sleep. But, you know, yeah, give them give them two days off. How about one day off and we come back and trade hard.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000 Right. Yeah. It seemed like you wouldn't, you wouldn't give them the day off if they don't need the day off.
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000 Like you need the day off or something very specific, like some sort of fatigue situation or whatever.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000 Bottom line is, is a dichotomy. Right. Can you go too far with comfort and pleasure and leisure? Yes, you can.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000 Yeah. Can you go too far with discipline and hardness and sternness and scarcity of resources? Yes, you can. You have to find a balance somewhere in the middle.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:41.000 I think the point here is that people lean towards, well, if I want to increase morale, I just need to give luxury to the troops.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000 That's the wrong way to lean.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:54.000 Actually, lean. I'm not saying go full bore, but you should lean in the direction of hard training discipline. Lean in that direction. Don't go full bore in that direction. Lean in that direction.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000 Yeah. It's almost like, I mean, you think, but it seems like making them feel what, like empowered or strong, right?
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000 Let that's kind of the result you're going to. Hey, let me just break it for break it down for you real simple.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000 If you go and you have a good training, you just do how do you feel when you're done.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:19.000 How's your morale? Pretty high. Maralas, hi. If you sit there and watch TV all day and you eat a pizza and a donut, how do you feel at the end of the day? How's your morale?
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.000 Yeah, be morale, shabby. Now, if you train, you just do nine hours for 14 days straight, how do you feel broken down?
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Yeah. Right? And then how do you feel when it's like, hey, man, day off today, echo, all good. Hey, I guess what, I ordered some pizza for you too. It's coming.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000 It's going to be your in 15 minutes. We're going to shout out. We're going to watch the fights. Cool. That's good morale boost. We're all good. Yeah. But you got to find that balance.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000 Yeah.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000 All right, back to the book.
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000 Nor is high morale achieved through fitness or healthiness alone.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000 It is important not to confuse the idea of physical happiness with morale.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000 The happy faces of men after a good game of football are not necessarily the faces of men with good morale.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000 Morales, a mental rather than a physical quality, a determination to overcome obstacles and instinct,
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000 of instinct driving a man forward against his own desires.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000 Driving a man forward against his own desires.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000 That's a good one. That's a good one.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000 And he attaches the physical and the mental part a little bit more than I do.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000 I think they're a little bit more closely related. I think that when you're in good physical shape, it helps your mental morale.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000 But he goes on to say this, which is spot on.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000 High morale is not happiness.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000 Happiness may be a contribute to where he factor in the maintenance of morale over a long period,
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.000 but it is no more than that. A man can be unhappy, but can still regularly and without complaining advance and defend within the terms of the definition.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000 So that's an important thing.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000 And again, this is a trap that leaders get suckered into. Hey, if I can make my people happy, then morale is good.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000 No, no.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000 Pizza will make your people happy, but it won't increase morale.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000 It might increase morale if you get it at the right time for the right reason.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000 Do you eat Hawaiian pizza?
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000 No.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000 Check.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000 Is that just a lie?
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000 Yeah, that's a complete violation.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000 We don't even need that kind of pizza in Hawaii.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000 Generally speaking, he didn't correct.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000 Well, there you go.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000 That's the thing. It's like Canadian bacon.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000 What does Hawaiian pizza do to your morale?
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000 Apparently it's inhibitor.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000 Yeah, it's an inhibitor.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000 Well, Canadian bacon, yes, like Canadians.
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000 Is this Canadian bacon? It's just a little piece of ham, basically.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000 Yeah.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000 You go, hey, to someone from Canada, be like, hey, this is Canadian bacon.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000 The like, no, that's ham.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000 You made that up.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000 Have you ever have an English muffin before?
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000 Yes.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000 I mean, England.
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000 Because they don't.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000 Yeah.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000 They just call them.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000 Just like French fries, right?
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000 Yeah.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.000 Or wait.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000 In French, in France, they're called something else though.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000 They're not called French fries.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000 No, that's England.
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000 I think they're called French fries.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000 Yeah.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000 Yeah.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000 That makes sense.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000 Same deal, then.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000 All right.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000 This is an important another.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000 Again, you can see I was in going through this to figure out what I was going to.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000 What parts I was going to single out?
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000 I ended up doing so much of this one.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000 Yeah.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000 Because at almost every line is like, yes, you need to know that.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000 Yes, I need to know that.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000 I need to remember that.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000 So here's one.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000 Hi, morale is not toughness.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000 This one caught me a little off guard.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000 Some very tough men in this war have turned out to be very disappointing in action.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000 Toughness is a physical and not a mental asset.
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000 Tough men will occasionally perform an isolated act of bravery.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000 So the morale, however, is not a quality which produces a momentary act.
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000 It influences behavior at all times.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000 So that's completely true.
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000 And it's true in combat.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000 It's true in training, even.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000 Like somebody going through what basic seal training there was some tough guys there.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000 Like tough for you.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000 Oh, that guy seems like a tough guy.
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000 Quitter.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000 And then there's guys that get through buds.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000 It's like, oh, they were tough in buds.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000 Like they did some good job in buds, but it has nothing to do with how well you're going to do as a seal.
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000 Yeah.
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000 Like it does.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000 It's, I would say there's some correlation, but it's, it's a very loose correlation.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:33.000 Being a good seal, buds trainee has very little to do with being a good seal in a seal team.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000 And I think that's sometimes surprises people.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000 But then again, it's generally surprised people because being a good team.
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Because being good at buds, buds is a physical evolution has very little to do with your mentality and has very little to do with leadership and unit cohesion.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000 And so to show up at a team, what's the most important thing when you get to a team, the most important thing when you get to a team is to be a team member and be a leader in that team or a follower in that team.
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000 If you aren't those things, you're not going to be good.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000 You can be super tough.
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000 That's great.
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000 And there's times when it pays to be tough.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000 And you definitely, as a seal, you can't not be.
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000 You can't not have some level of toughness.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000 You know, when I think about being a seal, there's stuff that you just do on a regular basis that when it's your life.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000 When it's just the way your life is, you don't really think about it.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:41.000 But when you take a step back and you think about what you like when I think about my old job, and I'm talking about going back to the 90s, right?
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000 Oh, we're going to go, we have dive week, which is, or dive training.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000 So you go for like four or five weeks of dive training and you're diving two times a day.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.000 It's your wetsuit, your, your, your, your wetsuits wet when you're putting it back on and then you're going to go get an abote and you're going to drive for an hour and a half.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:16.000 An hour and a half up the coast and then you're going to, it's going to be dark and you're going to put on your drag or rebreather and you're going to get in that water again and you're going to kick in the darkness with bio luminescence flying around you for three and a half hours.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000 You're going to get into this random harbor, your freezing cold, you're going to plant all a limpid and fake limpid mind on some.
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:37.000 But navy ship somewhere, then you're going to paddle, you're going to swim, fin your way back out. You're going to run out of oxygen, once you run out of oxygen, you're going to come to the surface, and then you're going to swim on the surface for another.
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.000 48 minutes and then you meet up with that little zodiac boat, you get in, you're freezing, you're exhausted.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000 And then you drive an hour and 20 minutes to get back to Coronado when you get back, you're going to debrief you're going to get take care of your zodiacs then you're going to take care of your dive rigs then you're going to take.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000 You're going to take care of your personal gear, then you're going to take a shower and then you're going to sleep for three hours.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000 You're going to wake up with another dive mission tasking, you're going to do the same thing again.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000 Just cold, wet, miserable.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000 That's the life. That's the life.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000 So, do you got to have some level of mental toughness?
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000 Sure you do and every seal's got that.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:27.000 But this part talking about like, you know, when you start talking about leadership and being a team player and being a good leader and being a good follower and being smart,
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000 and tactically sound and being a good decision makers, those are the things that matter.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000 When you start talking about the just the idea of being tough, it's like, that's cool.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000 And it's important in everyone in the teams has that or most people in the teams have that baseline.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000 Because it is a little bit challenging to make it through seal training.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000 If you don't at least have some level, it does happen.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000 You get some guys who think, man, what happened?
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000 Or you just break down some people have the idea that once they get through seal training, they're done.
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000 You shouldn't be in seal training to go through seal training.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000 You should be in seal training to get to the seal teams to serve your country, to go into combat, to take the fight to the enemy.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000 That's why you join the seal teams.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000 Not to see how tough you are.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:21.000 So next, in brief, high morale is a quality which is good in itself and is latent in all men.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000 It maintains human dignity, in a enables fear and fatigue to be overcome.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000 It is involved with the idea of a conscience, but it should be not confused with fitness or happiness or toughness.
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000 So this goes pretty good lengths to make that distinction, section two basic factors of morale.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000 It is now necessary to consider what factors constitute the morale of the soldier in the heat of battle.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000 Certain factors may be described as essential conditions without which high morale cannot exist.
00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:01.000 These four basic factors are one leadership, two discipline, three comradeship, four self-respect.
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000 A fifth factor devotion to cause must exist, but need not necessarily influence all of the soldiers.
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000 There are numerous contributors to our factors which are of great importance but not essential conditions.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000 So that's what he's got. The fourth thing is that you have to have in order to have high morale.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000 Then the first factor of course is leadership which again he's supporting my argument that leadership is the most important thing.
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000 I don't feel that if you don't have leadership you're not going to have good morale.
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000 Right.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000 So right there I already got you beat, Monny.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.000 And guess what is second one is discipline, where does that come from? Leadership. What about common ownership?
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000 That's comes from all these things come from leadership. Anyways, we'll get to that.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000 Leadership morale is in the first place based on leadership.
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000 Good morale is impossible without good leaders.
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000 The quality of leadership is one which must be studied.
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000 Human beings are fundamentally alike in that very common characteristics apply to all men in varying degrees.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000 And this is what's such a great dichotomy of humans is that all humans are the same and all humans are different.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000 Right. Like you know it's true.
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000 How can that be true? All humans are the same. All humans are different. And that's completely true statement.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:26.000 In battle, the most important of these characteristics is fear. All men are afraid at one time or another and to a greater or lesser extent.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000 In moments of fear, they band together and look for guidance. They seek for a person to give decisions they look for a leader.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000 In times of war, the leader has opportunities denied to him in peace.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000 The difficulties, dangers and discomforts inseparable from the battlefield may make men cry out for the leadership they can do without in peace.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000 At such moments, men are too weak to stand alone. They find the burdens to great to bear and their own selves unequal to the task.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.000 The leader himself accepts the burdens of others and by doing so earns their greatest and the right.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000 Ornth their gratitude and the right to lead them.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000 Challenging times, things are going sideways. Bad things are happening.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000 That's when people are most susceptible to leadership.
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000 This is completely true. Every routine, a team dynamic where like when everything is going good.
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000 Pretty much like you can, it's going to be hard to tell who the leader is and then all of a sudden something happens.
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:38.000 Something that's chaotic or something that's challenging happens and then you can see that leader just shhh, rise to the top.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000 I see that a million times. I see that a million times putting pull-toons through training.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000 You kind of not really know what's going on. Who's really, who's really running this boom?
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000 You start hitting these guys with some downman and some IEDs in the training battlefield.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000 You'll see the real leaders will start to step up hopefully.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000 I don't know if they don't step up on all.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000 But, and this is totally true. You see people want to be led.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000 People want to be led. There's going to be some times a little leadership vacuum.
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000 Sometimes you've got to step in and fill that leadership vacuum.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000 Back to the book, consider a platoon. IED 30 men in action in the line.
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000 The men are drawn from all classes and all types.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000 They are there in the line because they have obeyed a long series of orders,
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000 which it was easier to obey than to disobey.
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000 But now the test comes. It is easier for them not to obey orders.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000 It is easier for them to stay where they are behind the hill and not advance over the crest
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000 and to full view of the enemy lies and weight beyond.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.000 The dominant motive force, which drives them over the hill, is the leader.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000 It is his quality of leadership above all things, which inspires the men to action.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000 This is one of those paints that I'm very clearly when people talk about,
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000 well, you know, the military even just does what you said because you're in charge.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000 Try that once everyone is going to die.
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000 Well, once your lives are at stake, people just don't rod your up to say,
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000 hey, Ecos plans kind of lame to go charge the machine gun nest,
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000 but you know what he's in charge, so I'm going to go do it.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000 No, doesn't work. You have to lead.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000 These men recognize in their leaders some quality, which they themselves do not possess.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000 That quality is decision.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000 Fear makes men sluggish and indecisive unable to decide and act for themselves.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000 This is, you know, people talk about being frozen by fear or,
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000 or have you ever had that thing where you're not quite sure what you're going to do?
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000 Like you, I don't know if I want to do this.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000 I don't know if I want to even like something stupid, like not something stupid,
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000 but you know buying a house, right?
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000 That's a big purchase you're going to lay down a bunch of money.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000 The market could go up or down.
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000 You're committing to a payment for 30 years.
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000 There's not so many things in life you commit to for 30 years.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000 Basically there's only one other one.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000 You're getting married, right?
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000 There's any other commitment that's 30 years.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000 I guess you get a tattoo that's a lifetime, right?
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000 So there's these decisions that you have to make.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000 And sometimes we don't, sometimes you see people don't want to make decisions.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000 Right? They don't want to make a decision.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000 What's making them in decisive?
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000 You think about it, what's making people in decisive is fear.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000 They're afraid of what that outcome might bring.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000 So if you find yourself being in decisive,
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000 instead of asking yourself, is this the right decision or wrong decision,
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000 ask yourself, what am I afraid of?
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000 Hmm.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000 Back to the book, the leader's power over his men is based on his ability
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000 and it caught through this fear paralysis and in doing so,
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000 to enable others to escape from it.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000 The rightness of the decision taken by the leader is irrelevant.
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000 Think about that from the leadership perspective.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000 If there's a decision that needs to be made,
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000 whether you're right or wrong is irrelevant,
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000 what you need to do is be decisive.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000 What matters is that the decision should be taken
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000 and that the leader should shoulder the responsibility for that decision.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000 The leader must convince his men of its rightness,
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000 even though he himself might be in maybe uncertain of his own judgment.
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000 If the leader will decide, the men will follow and fight.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000 If there is indecision, they will hesitate and flee.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000 In short, fight and survive, or fear and be slain.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000 The leader decides.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000 Yeah.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000 Moving on.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000 The leader's power of decision results from his ability
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000 to remain imperpitable in the crisis.
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000 His calmness prevents panic and his resolution compels action.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000 It follows that this.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000 It follows from this that the leader must be less fearful than his men.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000 He need not be impervious to fear.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000 Since men require a human figure to lead them,
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000 what he must do is radiate an atmosphere of confidence
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000 which will show his men that he is less afraid than they.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000 He must have the moral courage to stand firm
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000 when his men are wavering.
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000 In this respect, they will judge him by his power of thought
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000 and action in crisis.
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000 Fear destroys the faculty of thought and paralyzes action.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000 The leader must continue to think longer than his men
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000 and his thoughts must lead to action.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000 So there you go.
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000 Don't panic, don't freak out.
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000 You gotta stay calm.
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000 And how do you do that?
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000 You train for it.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000 And when you train for it, what do you learn from the training?
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000 You learn how to do detach.
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000 That's what you learn how to do.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000 That's how you keep your emotions in check.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000 You don't let him get a hold of you.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000 The leader's greatest asset is the ability to act normally
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000 in abnormal conditions.
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000 This is normal face.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000 101.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000 To continue to think rationally when his men have ceased to think
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000 to be decisive in action when they are paralyzed by fear.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000 So this is a, that section is something you should always
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000 strive to do from a leadership perspective.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000 Stay calm.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000 Don't panic.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000 Think about what's happening.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000 He didn't say it, but I'm going to say it detach mentally.
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000 So you don't get caught up in the emotion and the fear and the chaos.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000 Next, the object of training must be firstly to select those
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000 who possess within them.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000 The potentiality of leadership and second to develop these
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000 potentialities.
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000 So yes, you've got to look for who's going to be a good leader.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000 And then you've got to hone that leader.
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000 This is accomplished by giving the leader responsibility
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000 boom, my favorite cure for leadership problems is put people in
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000 leadership positions.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000 A leaders character will develop and proportion to the
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000 responsibility with which he has been entrusted.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000 The more responsibility you put on someone, the more
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000 responsible they're going to become.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000 Think about the little kids, right?
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000 Think about a little kid.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000 The more responsibility you give a little kid, the more mature
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000 they're going to be, the more responsibility they're going to take.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000 It starts with making your own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000 You should be doing that on your own as soon as it's physically
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000 possible.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000 You're going to make a mask.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000 That's what they're going to clean up the mess.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000 Every time you break down and you make that PB&J for your
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000 little child, you're taking responsibility away from them and
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000 you're making them a weaker human being.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000 And they feel it.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000 And they feel it.
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000 I made my, she's six, my daughter.
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000 I made her set the table.
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000 You know, the old class.
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000 Yeah, yeah, set the table.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000 And she knew what it was, but she hadn't really gone through the whole
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000 deal before.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000 So sure enough, she's like, you know, she didn't want to.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000 But I'm like, hey, you know, you set the table is what you do.
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000 You know, you're kind of, you know, this is your job.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000 You know, you're going to do the kind of thing.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000 So once she set like the first one, yeah, and she did it correctly,
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000 she was rolling with it.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000 It was her table.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000 She was like, hey, I'm here.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000 Boom, she was making decisions.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000 Taking ownership.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000 Oh, full of it.
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000 Oh, yeah.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000 And you could tell just in her tone kind of like she was super empowered.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000 Little six year old.
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000 Yeah.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000 You know, where, and kind of to look on the whole situation where
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000 this was someone who didn't want to do it.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000 It was a chore.
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000 Yeah.
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000 You want to do the chore.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000 But, you know, you know, you're going to do it.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000 You know, you implement it.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000 I mean, in my case correctly, you give them ownership.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000 That's what you did at contrast.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 You gave your daughter ownership.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000 This is your job.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000 This is your responsibility.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000 You said, you, this is how you do it, but you do it.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000 You make it happen.
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000 Yeah, that, and I use that term a lot.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000 Make it happen.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000 And it's weird.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000 I don't know if it's what it is about that term with my specific kids.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Because that's what that feels good.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000 Yeah, like you have influence over this whole situation.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000 It's good to think about it when you're, when, as a human being, it's kind of weird that you can make things happen.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000 It's good to think straight up.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000 Right?
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000 Yeah.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000 It's a positive thing.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000 Yeah, and, and yeah, that's a good one.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000 Making it, making it happen.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000 Make it happen.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000 And you know, like, because, and adults do this too.
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000 I do this.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000 We all do this.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000 Maybe you don't, I don't know.
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000 But, you know, how, like, if you say, hey, can you do this?
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000 And then, whether you don't want to or you don't know how to,
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000 you're just sketch about, you know, the whole thing you ask a lot of questions.
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000 Well, what if this?
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000 And you know, like, people do that.
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000 It's almost like they put a bunch of excuses, preloading.
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000 From, yeah, to indicate, hey, I can't really do this, you know, kind of thing.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000 And it's almost like, just, maybe it's like, then being hesitant,
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000 maybe it's everything, you know, all the same.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000 So my kids will do that a lot, you know, like, all but what is, you know,
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000 all these questions kind of thing indicating, they don't want to do it.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000 They want to throw up all this smoke, so you finally just go, hey, I'll do it or whatever.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000 And I started saying that.
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000 I was like, I don't know, make it up and they just do it.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000 They just make it happen.
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000 It's all that I mean, sure, the job won't be the greatest, the first time kind of thing.
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000 But they have the attitude of just making it happen, you know.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000 You ever, you ever heard like the old guy that's like, when I was your age.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000 Yeah, sometimes it's me.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000 Yeah, I was going to say, no, you just made me think that because I do that.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000 You know, I'll be like, what, I was your age.
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000 I wasn't a seal, but you know, you're getting me.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000 That doesn't work in my case. Do that ever work for you? Yeah.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000 It does. Well, never work.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000 Because, you know, when one of my older kids that are, you know, my age when I wasn't a seal-up tune,
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000 it's like, you know, you're asking me how to do, like, some such simple life thing,
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000 yeah, or asking me to do it for you.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000 Yeah.
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000 Like, are you serious right now?
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000 Yeah.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000 Are you serious right now?
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000 Yeah.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000 When I was your age, I was in a seal-up tune.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000 I was going on deployment overseas.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000 I had guns and radios and encryption devices.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000 And you're telling me what, you know, whatever the thing is, you can't make that happen.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000 Is that where you're at right now?
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000 Yeah.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000 And then, could you be what I was your age?
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000 I always feel like, when my dad or whatever would say that,
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000 and I feel like if I say it to the my kids, they're going to be thinking like,
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000 Yeah, but it's not cool.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000 It's not, it's, I'm actually saying this, putting myself like in a little bit of check.
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000 It's like, we talked about last time, you know, you can't just be like,
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000 who, when I was, yeah, no, you need to be, I need to do a better job.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000 But it is good.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000 The thing is, it is good because the way my, and it'd be usually my older daughter,
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000 because my older daughter, because she's the one that actually is of age without her was in.
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000 She actually takes it in a, in a positive way, like,
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000 she'll have a look on her face like dang.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000 I am actually being like really, really dumb right now to be even asking this.
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000 I can obviously figure this thing out, what it does, you know,
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000 some, you know, the DMV, how do you set an appointment at the DMV?
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000 Are you serious right now?
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000 Are you serious right now?
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000 Make it out.
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000 Yeah, you can't figure that out.
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000 You could never heard of something called Google.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Yeah.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000 Think of how easy things are now.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.000 Yeah.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000 But you can't even do that?
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000 No, not happening.
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000 I was in a, I was in a, I was in a damn seal between when I was your age.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000 I think I was responsible for stuff.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000 They're telling me you can't figure out how to set an appointment at the DMV.
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000 Are you kidding me?
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000 This is what I think.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000 I did my hypothesis.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000 Yeah.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000 I think that you say enough stuff to your older daughter in this case, where she can relate, where
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000 it resonate.
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000 I get where you're saying it just is.
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000 Yes.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000 But I think that once you say what I was your age, I was in a seal platoon.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000 She got, she checks out.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000 That's what I need to be careful of.
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000 That's what I need to be careful of.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000 The other thing I'll get from my kids, we just moved here.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000 You know, you, you, you know, to be different.
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000 They kind of, yeah, I'm not, like, well, that's, of course, you did that.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000 Yeah.
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000 And I'm like, no, no, you did not true.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000 Yeah.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000 It's not just like, oh, I did that because I'm more square away than you are.
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000 No, you're actually more capable than I ever was.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000 Yeah.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000 But there's need to step up your game.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000 I know, Racy, and this is my whole point.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000 The things you're correct with, what you're saying, you're correct.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000 But from the kids standpoint, they don't believe that.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000 Like, from my, if my dad would tell me that kind of stuff, I'd be like, yeah, I,
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000 I literally think that's because you're you.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000 Not to say that you're tougher or you're whatever.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000 It's like, you're you.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000 But right, you're you. You lived in the cave mandates.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000 Leave me alone about like, figuring, but then if you're like, hey, go,
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000 make the DMV appointment, go and Google, figure it out, kind of things.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000 That, that relates to them.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000 It's like, yeah, he's right.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000 And then spread it and if she's a grown up, essentially, you know, she's going to
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000 She's going to read it.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000 When my son was like 10 years old, you know, and he might sound
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 a good surfer.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000 And I was out surfing with him and I was watching him surf.
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000 And I said, you know, he was patting.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000 I just caught a wave like beautiful wave.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000 He's patting out.
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000 And I said, in a little while, you're going to be a better surfer than I
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000 What I am.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000 And I thought he'd say, oh, that's cool.
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000 He looked at me like I was completely insane.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.000 Yeah.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000 And like I was the craziest, like, it'd be like, he, you could see
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000 in his eyes.
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000 He thought that that was not a humanly possible thing that
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000 would ever happen.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:57.000 I mean, imagine that.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000 Like, that's the look in his face.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000 And he kind of just completely shrugged it off and's like, yeah, right.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000 Yeah.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000 And I mean, six months later, he was better than me.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000 And now he's just like infinitely better than me.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000 Yeah.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000 But through your point, when, you know, when you're looking up at
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000 Dad, then sometimes it's this is an unachievable thing.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000 Yeah.
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000 And actually, that's not true.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000 And the young kids got a recognize that they can outperform
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000 their lame parents if they put their mind to it.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000 Yeah.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000 And the same thing that happens with subordinates, right?
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000 You have your subordinate on your team and you think, hey, you have more
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000 skill than I ever had.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000 You have more talent than I ever had.
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000 If you apply it correctly, you will be able to outperform me
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000 without question.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000 And sometimes people look at you like, oh, you're crazy.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000 That could never happen.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000 It's like, no, it can happen.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000 Yeah.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000 It can happen.
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000 But you've got to train.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000 That's another thing is people think, oh, well, you just,
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000 this is natural.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000 No, no, no, no.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000 Oh, no.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000 Oh, yeah.
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000 On the other side.
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000 No, I know that's one.
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000 That's another thing.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000 Like when I was on with, when we had Captain Plum and Jim
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000 Conkelon, and they were like throwing me in the basket of being like
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000 them.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.000 Yeah.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000 You know, my day guys is all along.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000 Just check yourselves.
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000 I'm 47 years old and I'm barely hanging on to like
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000 figuring the stuff out.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000 I'm not in the, I'm not in the game with you guys in terms of
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000 figuring out what you all have figured out.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000 I mean, those guys are leaps and bounds and in
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000 iteration upon iteration of knowledge above me.
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000 And, and I'm just sitting there thinking,
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000 take it easy, Captain Plum.
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000 Yeah.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000 But again, that's just sort of a matter of perspective.
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000 You know, like that things can seem so much like they can
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000 seem like a very, something very specific.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000 But just because of your perspective, you know, you don't get
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000 for sure.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000 You know, yeah.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000 All right, check.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000 Going back to the book.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000 His position as the man responsible for the lives and
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000 well-being of his men must be impressed upon him.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000 In battle, his preoccupation with his men's affairs will give
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000 him less time to think of his own fears.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000 The mere fact of responsibility will increase the leaders
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000 and powers of decision and make him confident of his ability to handle
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000 any crisis.
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000 So you've got to train people in these challenging situations.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000 Training must also seek to equip the leader with the other
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000 qualities which will help him in his task.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000 Here are those qualities.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000 A leader should be efficient.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000 He should possess self-confidence.
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000 He should be firm and just in his dealings with his men.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000 He should be clear-cut and definite in giving orders.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000 He should pay attention to administrative details.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000 He should prepare his men and advance for any new experience they may have
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000 to meet.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000 All these things are important, but they can never be a substitute for.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000 A decision in action and B calmness in crisis.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000 Yeah.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000 Stay calm.
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000 Now, one thing that I get a little nervous about talking about
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000 is the decision in action is sometimes what that means.
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000 The way that translates to a young, pulled to leader is
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000 I'm going to make a decision right now.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000 Hey, everyone, you know, boom, I'm going to jump into it.
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000 And you can't do that.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000 You have to do assessment.
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000 You have to look at what the situation's going to.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000 Actually, you've got to have a protocol of how you're going to make those decisions.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000 You've got to think about the way it's going to go down.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000 You can't just jump at the first thing that pops in your mind.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000 You need to think about it.
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000 You need to think about the options.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000 You need to think about the consequences of those options.
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000 And then you need to see if you can move in the right direction without full commitment.
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000 Right?
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000 Do you have to occasionally make full commitment on a decision?
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000 Yes.
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000 If you're, if you got ambushed and you're in the kill zone,
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000 guess what you're going to have to do.
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000 Assault through the ambush.
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000 That's what you're going to have to do it.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000 You're going to have to do it decisively and powerfully.
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000 And with full 100% commitment.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000 But if you take some rounds, but you're not sure if it's an ambush,
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000 well, you might not want to necessarily assault through that position.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000 So you need to think you need to allow things to develop.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000 So it's a very, it's part of the art of leadership with, with teaching young,
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000 see a leaders.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000 Okay.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000 You need to let the situation develop.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000 Here's the problem.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000 Once the situation starts developing,
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000 if you let it develop too far, it's got to start a controller.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000 Right?
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000 It's, it's a, it's a little, it's a little problem.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000 Right?
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000 When you look at it, then you need to, look at the problem.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000 Make sure you understand the problem.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000 Meanwhile, the problem in some cases is growing.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000 If you allow the problem to grow too much,
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 now you can't control the problem anymore,
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000 and you're going to get crushed by the problem.
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000 If you, if you see a small problem and you jump right into solving the problem,
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000 that might, the problem might have to be what you thought it was.
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000 And you went out at the wrong direction.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000 So there's a fine line.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000 Like the decision in action is important,
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000 but thoughtful decision is what it should be.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000 Thoughtful decision.
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000 And the reason I keep trying to stress and articulate to people
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000 that you don't necessarily need to make a full commitment to a plan.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000 You can take them, you can take a smaller step, an iterative step in the right direction.
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000 Before you just jump in.
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000 So that's just important to think about.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000 How does all that compare to making no decision?
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000 Well, making no decisions is the worst thing you can do.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000 Making no decision standing there and the kill zone getting overrun by the enemy and everyone killed.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000 That's the worst thing you can do.
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000 We want to at least make some kind of a decision.
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000 So that's why I think he stresses so the importance of decision in action so much
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000 is because he's probably seeing people be in decisive and battle and it's a horrible, horrible thing.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000 So yes, you want to be decisive, but let's take that one little step further.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000 We want to have thoughtful decisions.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000 Do we want to have a mental 20 minute debate over the decision?
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000 No.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000 A thought can take five seconds.
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000 You can let a situation develop for eight seconds.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000 And you go, wait a second.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000 I think this is what's happening.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000 Let me confirm to I see anyone over there.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000 Yep, what the enemy fire is increasing.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000 You know what?
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000 We need to make this move.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000 Boom.
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000 You do it.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000 That's what we're talking about.
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000 Back to the book.
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.000 These are two vital attributes of a leader with which he will succeed and without which he will fail.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000 These two vital qualities exist in varying degrees in every leader.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000 Those men who possess them to a limited extent can nevertheless become adequate leaders by being trained in the qualities of the world.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000 They're trained in the qualities already enumerated.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000 Such leaders must in the first place be efficient.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000 This efficiency will impress itself on the men.
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.000 They're by creating an atmosphere of confidence with which will partially compensate for any lack of personality.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000 By this means training can make men into competent, but not outstanding leaders.
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000 There's another aspect of leadership in its relation to morale.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:33.000 The best type of leader earns the respectful admiration of his men because he possesses certain good qualities which they lack.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.000 A brutal leader who disregards the feelings of his men will not infuse them with the quality of self-respect.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000 The morale of the troops he commands regardless of his qualities of leader will not be the highest.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000 So even Monty who kind of comes across as being, you know,
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000 a loof to the troops he's there you go.
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000 The brutal leader is not going to have good morale.
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000 Factually.
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000 An element of self-respect.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000 Self-respect is a whole section on self-respect that's coming.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000 Yeah.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:17.000 But yes, if you have a dog and you beat the dog and you're a brutal leader, the dog will not have any self-confidence.
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000 It'll be a broken dog.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000 You can do that with human beings too.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000 If you bark at your people and you break them down all the time, they won't be able to stand up.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000 Another way to do that in a more or should I say less brutal way is to do everything for sure.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000 Same thing men know.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000 You do it yourself.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000 Yeah.
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000 If you're setting the table all the time, your daughter never realizes that she has the capability of doing that.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000 Yeah.
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000 She's tying shoes, carrying backpacks, like all that, you know, everything.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000 If you're helping your kids, you're hurting your kids.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000 Yeah.
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000 Yeah.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000 And that clarifies it even more in its culture.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000 Once you kind of latch onto that idea, you just see it everywhere.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000 You ever see these kids, like, I don't know, like a TV show or documentary type,
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000 whether in, I don't know, somewhere in Asia or some village where the four year old girl goes and
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000 she kills a snake and skins it and then walks like in the mud for another mile back home,
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000 cooks it for the family, you know, like, and you're like, dang that cross for.
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000 Yeah.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000 And she can do, like, I can't even do that stuff.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000 You know, kind of thing.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000 It's like, man, you can't put it into perspective where it's like, these are kids who are just like,
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000 making it happen.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000 You know, beings are so adaptable.
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000 Like, you see the little gymnast kids.
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000 Oh, yeah.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000 Yeah.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000 There's six years old iron cross.
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000 There's crazy, dude athletic feats that are just insane.
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000 Yeah.
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000 And why is that?
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000 Well, because they were put in that position and train hard.
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000 Now, some of those, some of the sometimes let's get straight a little bit too hard.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000 I think they lose, they can lose other aspects of their life.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000 But dang, if you wouldn't like to be able to do an iron cross, six years old, come on.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000 Yeah.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000 The point still told you remains.
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000 Yes.
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000 So let your kids develop and let your subordinates develop.
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000 Give them responsibility, build them up.
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000 Back to the book.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000 Moreover, it is important to realize that while men are dependent on the word of the leader,
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000 they are capable of much independent action on their own.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000 And are even capable of making their own decisions.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000 So this is kind of, this is kind of funny, right?
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000 It's Monti basically saying, look, I got a little surprise for you.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000 Little surprise.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000 Your troops can actually think for themselves.
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000 Yeah.
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000 You know, imagine that.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.000 Yeah.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000 Imagine that.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000 So obviously this is, this is decentralized command, right?
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000 This is it.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000 And you have to let your subordinates lead.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000 He goes on to say British soldiers have much native character and individuality.
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000 What is required is that the leader shall give the initial and vital decisions along with which the men can work.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000 So yes.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000 And you know what?
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000 This is actually a glad that Monti said it in that kind of funny way.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000 It's the same thing that we're talking about with kids,
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000 where you think, oh well, my kids probably not capable of doing that.
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000 Your kid is capable of doing that.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000 Yeah.
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000 Your kid can go out there and kill a snake and bring it back and skin it and cook it.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000 Oh yeah.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:21.000 You just have to allow them the the the room to let that happen and give them the authority and power them to do it.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000 Yeah.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000 Yeah.
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000 Fully.
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000 And that yeah.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000 So it's a night and day to the other actually last night.
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000 Oh, I was making chicken. Yeah, I make chicken and I usually make rice in Hawaii.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000 You make rice with everything.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000 Anyway.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000 So I'm like, okay, make the right. I go, hey, I tell my daughter.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000 She's six again.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000 By the way, I was like, hey, make the rice.
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Here's the thing.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000 I showed her how to make rice.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000 Make rice isn't hard, but it's not like, I mean, in most steps.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000 Yeah, there's some sense for sure.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000 And it wasn't for me anyway before I taught her how to make rice.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000 It wasn't real obvious that a six year old should be making rice.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000 You know, like, not in a rice cooker too, by the way, just like on the stove regular.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000 But I thought at that point, I was like, hey, why can't I just show her how and teach her how.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000 Even if I don't teach her in one day, okay, the next time we make rice, which is going to be soon,
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000 I'll go over it again, kind of thing. Why should she not know how to make rice right now?
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000 Why should I have to do this for her?
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000 Whatever. Anyway, I teach her to tell her to make rice.
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000 Super simple.
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000 Boom last night was the first time where it was her responsibility to make rice.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000 She makes rice.
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000 She makes rice.
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000 Six years old.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000 Makes rice.
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000 Boom.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000 She's big.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000 But you know what?
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000 No, we're moving in the right direction.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:33.000 Exactly.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000 Right.
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000 So the point is, too, is that you're as a leader.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000 As leaders the same thing.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000 You're letting your guys run the operation.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000 Let your troops step up and take control of something that you and your.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000 Egotistical maniac mind.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000 Think only your people will think that's what your boys can get it done to.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000 Yeah. And if they if they bat of 88 instead of 100 cool, next time they're going to get a 92.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000 And then I'm after that. They're going to get a 96.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000 Yeah, because that's a big obstacle too, right?
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000 Mentally.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000 It's kind of like sure. I could teach him how to do it.
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000 But why would I?
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000 Well, yeah, you see that. You see that even more.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000 See in parenting.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000 It's like cool.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000 My kid can make the rice.
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000 Oh, yeah, you're hot.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000 We must be.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000 But in in a team environment.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000 Our ego.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000 Our ego flares up because we want to be the one, right?
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000 Yes, especially if you can do it at a 10.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000 Yes, guys only do it at eight at the end of the day.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000 And your job's done.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000 You know what? And you feel.
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000 You feel like that's your little power.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000 You know, that's my little powers. Like, well, you know,
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000 you really don't do that.
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000 I better come down and check out how you're better.
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000 I prep in this stuff because you know,
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000 yeah, you know, I'm kind of the man.
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000 Yeah, that's where it is.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000 Yeah, kind of like when you like,
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000 let's say they had to like screw on some stuff or okay.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000 Are you so we're going to moving company right?
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000 You know this.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000 And at the end, you load up the crates.
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000 And the trucking, you have to tie him with a certain kind of knot.
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000 Right.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Learn how to tie that knot.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000 The kind of the super tight.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000 But you all you got to do is pull one string to get cool little things.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000 So I learned how, right?
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000 And yeah, I wanted the supervisor or whatever.
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000 Like yeah, go tie it off or whatever.
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000 And I could totally do it.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000 We've been doing this for months or whatever.
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000 And then he'll go and he'll check it and he'll like,
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000 then he'll pull it just a little bit more.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000 Yeah, you know, like as it's just like,
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000 put a little bit on it.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000 You know, you said, just your from the mass.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000 You just have to do it right there.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000 But we do that all the time.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000 Like, does this we like to have our own little rice balls,
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000 peaking the price, right?
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000 That's a weird term.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000 But you've heard that term before, right?
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000 Like, hey, you want somebody messing with his rice bowl.
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000 Meaning like, this is mine.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000 Like, oh, I'm the guy that does this part of the job.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000 And I don't want anyone else know how to do it.
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000 That's my little rice bowl.
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Stay out of my rice bowl.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000 There's a lot of rice bowls.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000 I was never into that.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000 Well, at least once I was actually in leadership positions.
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000 I was very, I'm not, I don't care.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000 Like, oh, you're, you come on.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000 Come on and grab some of this rice.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000 Because if you can, if you can take my rice bowl from me,
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000 guess what?
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000 I can go find another rice bowl.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000 I'll bring it in here and we'll start.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000 We'll have more rice.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000 It's good, man.
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000 Yeah.
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000 Because that's not as intuitive.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000 No, it's not.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000 Everyone thinks that everyone thinks that there.
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000 Everyone leans towards, hey, I want to be the guy.
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000 Yeah.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000 The ego flares up.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000 Back to the book.
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000 Good morale can be created in a narrow sphere by a good leader.
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:20.000 But a platoon or company is obviously influenced by the general feelings existing in a division or army.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000 So now we're talking to you.
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000 You have multiple layers, multiple layers above the platoon or the company.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000 You've got the army, you know, the division.
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000 Good morale implies confidence in the high command and in the plan.
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000 And you capitalize the plan.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000 The plan.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000 A strong leader on a high level can have a powerful influence on the general attitude to the men of a platoon.
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000 He cannot however influence their movements over the last flute few vital yards of an attack.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000 On the other hand, a strong leader on the low level can make his men carry out a single fine attack.
00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:02.000 But he cannot sustain their morale indefinitely if there is a lack of confidence in the high command and its plan.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000 That's a challenge.
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000 It's a challenge.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000 If your troops are looking at the strategy going, what the hell are we doing?
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000 Like you can get the guys through one attack or two or three missions.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000 But eventually they're saying, hey, what's going on? Why are we doing this?
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000 This doesn't make any sense.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000 And vice versa.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000 A leader cannot do without discipline.
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000 Do you ever think about when I say discipline on the podcast?
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000 You should put some little.
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000 Like a sound.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000 Every time I say.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000 Especially when I say something like this, a leader cannot do without discipline.
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000 His aim must be to create such a discipline body of men that all his orders will be obeyed instantly.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:59.000 This habit of obeying the leaders' orders must be so instilled into his men that he will carry on and fight even though he himself falls.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000 There's a problem with for that statement right there.
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000 Right?
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000 The aim, this aim cannot be achieved without discipline.
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000 The second factor of morale is discipline.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000 So a couple of things here.
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000 First of all, I don't want my team to instantly obey all my orders without question.
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000 If I tell them to do something stupid, I actually want them to tell me no.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000 On top of that, if you think for one minute that all your people do is obey you,
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000 that when you die, they're just going to suddenly sprout leadership skills and start leading you're wrong.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:44.000 You have to raise them in a way and treat them in a way that they are being challenged as leaders themselves and they're being allowed to lead in their stepping up and leading.
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000 And they're not waiting to instantly obey everything you do because if all you're doing is waiting for orders, you're not being proactive, you're not leading.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000 Decentralized commanders and happening and if something happens to me, you're going to freeze.
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000 So this little section from Monti.
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000 No, I don't like it. Discipline is something that is important. You have to understand.
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000 You have to have discipline standard operating procedures. You have to have discipline to stay within those procedures.
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000 But on top of that, you have to have the freedom to when those procedures aren't working to say, hey boss, this isn't a good call.
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000 Here's what we should do instead.
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000 Now, does this mean you and I are going to have a debate in the middle of a firefight over what the plan is?
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:36.000 No, because we work together, we trust each other. You know what I'm coming from. I know where you're coming from and when I make a call, you're going to do it.
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000 And by the way, if you make a call even though I'm senior to you, if you make a call, guess what I'm going to do.
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000 Guess what I'm going to do. Follow. Yes, I'm going to follow you.
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000 If you're like, hey, jackal punch right, get ready to flank these guys and I'm the senior guy, but you just told me to do that.
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000 Guess what I'm going to do it. I'm going to support you.
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000 So that's what you want.
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:06.000 You have to be careful because as people, if you have someone whose personality is sensitive to that, right?
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000 And you say, hey, jackal, come try and get on their flank.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:22.000 And my response is, excuse me a minute, just who do you think you are actually I'm in charge of this platoon. Why don't you just lock it up?
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000 We're not going to punch right. We're actually going to move, you know what I mean? That's where we can get into that situation all day long. Guess what's going to happen to all of us.
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000 We're all going to die. So we have to figure that stuff out. We have to figure out that.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000 That we have to work together, but at the end, one of us has to submit to the situation, submit to the other person's leadership.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000 And by the way, there's 16 people in a platoon. In a seal platoon. There's 30 or 40 in a infantry platoon.
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000 It's pretty easy to get in the habit of like, hey, when the boss speaks, we're all going to submit to what he's saying.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.000 Oh, if the one of my platoon sergeants speaks, okay, well, he barks out something. Guess what? We'll submit to that.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000 Occasionally, someone else will rise up and see something.
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:15.000 We have to work and train together so that we know when we need to submit to someone else or when we, or when we need to say, hey, negative.
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000 We're not doing that. We're going over here. These are, these are challenging things, right?
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000 It's think of how easy it is to have the Monti attitude and be really easy for me to say right now.
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000 Like, hey, listen, this is what happens. You'd have to have your men. So discipline when you tell them do something they do it.
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000 That's the easiest solution, right? Oh, okay, great. Joc was put out the word. Oh, by the way, if I get hurt, follow the guy that's in the second chain of command. Okay, cool. That's easy.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000 That's easy day. Right? Now we're going to win every time. No wrong. Because guess what? Occasionally, me, I'm the leader.
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:52.000 I'm going to make a bad decision. And somebody needs to check me. Now are you going to check me every single time? No, you're not. Are you going to check me?
01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:01.000 You know what? We're going to work together so much that if you think, you know what, I'm not sure Joc was making the right call, but at least I'm going to start to execute it. I'm going to keep a heads up and move forward.
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000 And then if I see what I think might be a problem happening, I'm going to say something.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:15.000 But my response out of the gate is we're going to go. That's the kind of thing that's going on here. This is a dynamic environment interacting of human beings. It's freaking challenging.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000 Yeah. But to blanket everyone, when I tell you to do something, you do it.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000 I want instant obedience to everything that I say.
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000 Again, that works great, 94% of the time. 6% of the time, it's an auger disaster and everyone dies.
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000 So we don't want to allow for that. We want to allow some flexibility in there. That is harder to do. It's harder to have that flexibility. It's much more challenging.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000 But it gives you such better capability and survivability.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:56.000 That that's how you want to set it up. It takes a lot more. That's why that's why the more advanced you get in the more tactically advanced you get the more there is of that.
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:06.000 So if you go to a Marine Corps infantry, they're going to have less push back and less. They're going to have more obedience, more just straight road obedience.
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:16.000 As they should, because guess what? In 18 year old Marine doesn't have as much knowledge as a 25 year old staff serge or the platoon commander that went to the basics of going these right.
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000 So there's you're going to have these situations that are going to, so in a normal infantry,
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:31.000 the platoon, there's going to be less push back. You get into a seal platoon. Well, now you've got a bunch of experience guys. Just about everyone here has a few to pull.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000 So the new guys are going to say anything. But the guys with two or three platoons, they're going to say, hey boss, not a good caller, they're going to give you some push back. Why?
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:52.000 Because you've got a more experienced field of people. So it takes more practice to get that to get to be able to interact together properly and have that flowing chain of command.
01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:10.000 And also, and can expand and contract and can move from one person to the next dynamically as a mission is happening. I mean, there's times in close quarters combat where basically there's a person at the front of the train and that person rotates out every few seconds.
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:21.000 There's tactical situations where there's a new person making the calls every 10 seconds think about that. That's radical to have a new person making a call every 10 or 15 seconds. There's a new person doing it.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:28.000 How do you do that? Well, they understand everyone understands, they understand the tactics, they understand how we work together. That's what we want.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:40.000 As opposed to there's only one person that can make the call. That's just centralized command. So again, it's very, it's hard for me to to throw this out there, right?
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:48.000 Because I don't want an 18 year old Marine thinking, whoa, you know, I found a like with the platoon commander says, I'm just going to tell him no. Yeah, that's not what I'm saying. Not what I'm saying.
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:57.000 I do want you to think. I do want you as an 18 year old Marine to think. I want you to be understanding what decisions being made to the best of your ability.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:07.000 And yes, if you see something happening that is absolutely not good and you know it, your damn right, you should speak up and your platoon commander should be happy that you're speaking up.
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:17.000 But if you're a guy that's going to speak up every time a decision gets made because you think maybe a different way that might be a little bit better in your mind, you're going to suffer the consequences of
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:26.000 number one, the whole platoon being in decisive and number two, your boss is going to tell you to shut up because your idea that might be 8% better than his idea.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:33.000 We don't have time to discuss that right now. So unless you see something that's real significant, yes, shut up and do what you told.
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000 If you see something that's really significant, okay, hey boss, negative can't do that. There you go.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:48.000 The second factor discipline. The object of discipline is the is the conquest of fear.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000 Press this is new perspective for me that the reason we have discipline is to conquer fear.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000 It's interesting, right? Yeah.
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:13.000 Actually true, too. What is it that gets you to do that thing that you're afraid of? You have the discipline to just drive through it adequately to determine the best method of doing this requires an analysis of fear to be made.
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000 There are two aspects of fear. Fear can suddenly attack a man through his imagination.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000 A corpse in a ditch or a grave by the side of the road will remind him of the peril of his position.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000 He will suddenly realize that he himself is liable to be killed. It is a function of discipline to fortify the mind.
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000 So that it becomes reconciled to unpleasant sights and accepts them as normal everyday occurrences.
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000 Fear can also creep in upon a man during periods of monotony in the line.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000 So this is the other type of fear. There's two types, right? The one that just jumps on you.
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000 And the other one is creeps on you.
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000 At such a time he will have the opportunity to appreciate the dangers which beset his life.
01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:03.000 Fear acting through his thoughts can so reduce a man's hardcore of courage that he will become nervous and fearful.
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000 Discipline strengthens the mind so that it becomes impervious to the corroding influence of fear.
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000 He teaches men to confine their thoughts within certain definite limits and instills the habit of self-control.
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000 Keep your emotions in check, keep your fear in check that requires discipline.
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000 The basis of fear is the awareness of danger.
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000 In itself this is healthy.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000 For a man who is aware of danger automatically takes steps to provide against it.
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000 It is only when fear dominates the mind that it becomes unhealthy and leads to panic.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000 So fear is good, we know that fear is healthy, we know that until you let it dominate your mind and then it's a problem.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000 Men must be urged to fight fear with courage so that they will advance or defend and not take refuge in fight in flight or in action.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:03.000 Man becomes aware of danger when he feels himself opposed to something more powerful than himself.
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:11.000 Right? Man becomes aware of danger when he feels himself opposed to something more powerful than himself.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000 In other words when he feels that his own armament is unequal to that of the enemy who oppose him.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000 It is important for a man to lose his individual feeling and to become an integral part of the battalion division and army to which he belongs.
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000 The larger the unit of which he feels himself to be a member, the larger will be the estimation of his own armament and the less will be his fear.
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:46.000 It is here that discipline shows its value for it can help a man to lose his own identity and become a part of a larger stronger unit.
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000 It is in this way that discipline will conquer fear.
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000 Got a relate to that bigger group.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000 You see this in like gang fights.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:08.000 The one person by themselves is a coward but then when they have 10 of their friends all of a sudden they're courageous. It's a horrible example but it's a reality.
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000 Right? It's a total reality.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000 I used to see that in the streets.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:31.000 Back in the day. Like one person.
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:45.000 Right. That's me when I was 15 years old. I'm super tough with all my friends. Right? It's a bad example but it's the reality.
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000 Yeah, like the big scraps.
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000 This corporate sense which discipline creates helps men face the unknown.
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000 At night men in the line become afraid of the unknown which stretches out in front of them.
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000 At all times in action they are afraid of new and terrifying weapons which may be used against them.
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000 Realize that these unknown quantities may bring danger to them.
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000 Their ability to face these dangers is immensely strengthened by feeling themselves to be part of a group.
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:17.000 The group is known and a certain quantity which they feel is strong enough to stand up to the unknown dangers with surround them.
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000 Strength the numbers.
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:28.000 The method by which the conquest of fear is achieved is the unifying of men into a group or unit under obedience to order.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000 He rolls right back to obedience to orders.
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000 Monty does.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000 And part of the reason is he's talking about conscripts a lot.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000 Drafties.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000 So there's a little bit of a.
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000 That's what he's dealing with.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000 Now as we know from hack and from general muka yama like, hey, if you treat your people right, doesn't matter that the draft is.
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000 Men require to be united if they are to give of their best.
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000 Discipline seeks to instill into all ranks of sense of unity by compelling them to obey orders as one man.
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000 This obedience to orders is the indispensable condition of good discipline.
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000 Men learn to gain confidence and encouragement from doing the same thing as their fellows.
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000 They drive strength and satisfaction from their company.
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000 Their own identities become merged into the larger stronger identity of the unit.
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000 You know what's interesting is I'll go.
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000 I'll even go a little bit more hardcore against Monty.
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:32.000 You know what to me is an exceptional unit is the unit where you don't even have to give orders.
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.000 Where you just where everyone knows what the intent is or you give them a way of looking like, hey, this is the intent.
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000 And people just do what they're supposed to do with no orders.
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000 Yeah.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000 That's what you really want.
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000 You know, there's a.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000 A chapter that lay fro where he's talking about prioritizing execute.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000 And he's talking about how it's when one of our guys fell through the roof.
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000 They were on a mission.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000 They were in Overwatch.
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000 They ended up having to conquer a sledgehammer through a concrete wall.
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000 And Lief and I were talking about he's like writing the chapter.
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000 And he was going to talk about like what his priorities were.
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000 And how he told the guys like, you know, you do this to this and he's like, yeah, well, the thing is I didn't tell anyone to do anything.
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000 And I was like, yeah, check because his guys knew.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000 But wait, we got this going on. We're going to set security. We're going to move like the everyone knows what's what you want.
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000 And then what that allowed Lief to do is I think about, okay, now bigger priorities.
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000 And that's what he wrote about.
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:49.000 But your troops, they shouldn't, you shouldn't even have to give them orders because they should be trained well enough to respond based on the situation and knowing and understanding the standard operating procedures and knowing very quickly what it is that your intent is as the leader.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000 So all you need to say is set security and the guys get into position where they're supposed to go.
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:09.000 That's how it should be. I'm not looking for, I'm not looking for obedience. You know what I'm looking for? What we used to call thinking shooters, you know, I want to pull too much thinking shooters.
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000 Meaning that they're thinking for themselves, they're making things happen.
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:21.000 They're understand what it is that I want done, whether I set it to them or whether we pre-briefed it or whether we've been through this, we've drilled it.
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000 But whatever they know what it is that I want done and I want my team to be thinking, this is decentralized command.
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000 When you get into just wrote obedience, we're losing the aspect of decentralized command.
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000 And as Monty said earlier, believe it or not.
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:46.000 Your men might be able to make some decisions on their own. It's like, yes, take that many, many steps further than that.
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000 Check.
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:58.000 Continue on men must learn to obey orders when all their instincts cry out for them not to be obeyed.
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000 They must learn to obey orders in times of stress so that they will do so in times of danger.
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000 They must learn to carry out their tasks under any condition and despite all difficulties.
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:18.000 In this way, the mass of loose individuals with their fears and weaknesses can be welded together into a united hole ready to act on the word of the leaders.
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:30.000 So again, what I'm saying is, I don't want them ready to act on the word of the leader. I want them ready to act on the thought of the leader.
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000 Discipline helps men to display fortitude in the face of fatigue and discomfort.
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:46.000 While at the same time it helps them conquer fear. It enables them uncomplainingly to triumph over difficulties which would have overcome them in times of peace.
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.000 This constant see in enduring hardship and fatigue is the quality which is most frequently required of the soldier.
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000 Individual fortitude and corporate courage are the twin products of discipline.
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000 So that's the straight positive aspects of discipline that I think of.
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000 Hey, things are going to be more than an entire one-ever discomfort, whatever.
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000 Fear, whatever. We have discipline, discipline, conquer all those things.
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000 Discipline implies a conception of duty. Nothing will be accomplished in the crisis of by man without a sense of duty.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:34.000 The century in and outpost holds his ground in the face of an attack because he has a sense of duty to those behind him. This sense is instilled by discipline because it teaches men to obey orders as a matter of course
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000 to know that it is wrong not to obey them and write that it is their duty to do so.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:53.000 For the soldier, this conception of duty does not embrace abstractions such as freedom or empire or democracy. In battle, a soldier's sense of duty extends only to the friends who are around him.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000 It is the job of the junior leader to encourage this sense of duty abstractions are the sphere of a politician.
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:09.000 So he goes real extreme in this one. And we all have heard this before. Hey, when you're in combat, you're not fighting for this political ideology, you're fighting for the man to your left and to your right.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:29.000 Absolutely true. Absolutely true. I would say, well, I know that it's not just that you have to, you when the immediate battles over, you need to look and say, okay, well, why are we doing this? Oh, we're doing this because we believe in our cause.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:41.000 So to me, it's both, you can't just cast out, you know, in my opinion abstractions are the sphere of politicians. No, troops need to believe in what they're doing.
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:49.000 A certain type of training may induce men to go forward and attack simply out of fear of the consequences of not doing so.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:20:02.000 This applies only to the weakest and most feeble of men who are of little value in battle. This type of training is an essential part of discipline, but it's never be missed to be mistaken for the whole. So he kind of goes one way and then the other.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000 It's like, yeah, sometimes you're just going to have to.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:12.000 You have to make people do what you want to do because they're afraid of you or they're afraid of the consequences. If you have to lead through fear.
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000 If you, if you, if you're, if your team is doing something only because they're afraid of the consequences, that's a losing battle.
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:34.000 Well, it's a losing war, right? You might win the battle, but you're not going to win the war. Continuing on, the type of training mentioned in the preceding paragraph, which implies a certain harshness and hardness has its value.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:47.000 The material comforts are now so incidious that there's some danger that this is the old fashioned idea of discipline. And it will be allowed to disappear. This must not happen.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:55.000 Soldiers will not win battles if their training is not been hard.
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000 That's a little less than for your entire life.
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000 Soldiers will not win battles if their training is not been hard.
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000 The softening influences of civilian life must be replaced by the exacting demands of military training.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000 Soldiers must forget the pleasures of peace and concentrate on the realities of war.
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000 Isn't it funny that this, this could be written right now and some of the cool, you know, training is getting easier and all that.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000 It's like, we always think that got to keep it hard. You always got to fight against the slippery slope of things getting easier.
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:37.000 In brief, discipline seeks to conquer fear by welding men into a cohesive whole unit united by obedience to orders.
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000 Yeah.
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000 No, I'm not with you, money.
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:48.000 It aims to create a body strong enough to carry each of its members through dangers and difficulties which they themselves would be unable to face alone.
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000 In this way, it promotes comradeship, which is the third factor of morale.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:59.000 Okay, I much more important in my opinion than the blind obedience of orders morale.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000 So we're talking about comradeship now.
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:08.000 Moral cannot be good unless men have come unless men come to have affection for each other.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000 A fellow feeling must grow up which will result in a spirit of comradeship.
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000 An army is made up of human beings.
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:25.000 So that however much a leader may inspire his man, however perfect the discipline morale will be hard and unsypathetic.
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000 If the warmth of comradeship is not added to it.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:39.000 War, the hard business is not necessarily a grim one. Men must laugh and joke together must enjoy each other's company and must get fun out of life even in times of danger.
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:47.000 Check this spirit of comradeship must begin at the section or tank crew level and work its way upward to army level.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:56.000 The importance of encouraging men to band together and identify themselves with their units has already been emphasized.
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:04.000 This will be necessary to make considerable efforts to further this spirit of comradeship.
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000 Junior commanders must plan to create this spirit in the same way they plan to train their men and fire their weapons.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000 Men must not be moved from unit to unit or even from platoon to platoon unless there's good reason for doing it.
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000 And these reasons must be made clear to the men.
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000 A man who has served among friends in the same platoon for a long time will be helped by them to face the trials of battle.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000 He will feel around him, his reserves of courage and purpose upon which he can draw.
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:40.000 There will be a feeling of solidarity and out of this feeling there will grow up a determination to advance together and defend together and even die together.
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:58.000 In wartime with such heavy casualties and constant reinforcements it is always found that this comradeship can be built up most quickly by ensuring that new arrivals has reinforcements belong to the part of Britain from which the unit is originally drawn and to which it belongs in peace time.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:11.000 That's what you've got to have your team join together and then he's saying, look if you've got new reinforcements coming in and they came from Darbyshire and there's a unit from Darbyshire, send them to go work with the guys from Darbyshire.
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000 They already have a connection.
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:34.000 The comradeship is, and you know who didn't do that, the Soviets, the Soviet Union was famous for not doing that because they didn't want there to be a really strong unity in the forces because then that unity might turn into a movement.
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:44.000 They didn't want that they would notoriously split everyone up. You would never be with a guy from your hometown. They'd split everyone up. This is the opposite of that.
01:24:44.000 --> 01:25:03.000 This is based on affection and trust which between them produced and atmosphere of mutual goodwill and feeling of interdependence. Men learn to have faith in each other and to depend on each other according to the abilities of each and a tank crew, gun team or infantry section, men do not work well together, merely because they are disciplined and well led.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:13.000 They do so because they trust each other and because they are bound together by an affection which is never expressed in words, but shown itself indeed.
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:23.000 Comradeship is a great antidote to fear because it gives a man friends. A man must take friends, a man must make friends in his platoon, friends whom he respects and admires.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000 In battle these friends will prevent him from feeling lonely. A man alone is a man who will find it hard to stand up to the dangers of the line.
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:44.000 A man alone is a man afraid. If he has friends he will derive strength from their presence and he will be anxious not to let them down in battle.
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:59.000 You will seek to do his fair share of all tasks which come to his crew or section he will feel ashamed if he cannot assist his friends in their duties and maintain his place with them in the line.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:14.000 Within them a touch of streak of generosity and unselfishness, a touch of nobility and these qualities will be brought out in the attitude to their friends. Friendship causes men to give their best.
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:30.000 I guess we started talking about this a little bit in the beginning. If you are not, if you don't want to be a part of the team, you are going to miss this whole section of what makes a unit to have high morale.
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:44.000 If we are not friends that hurts our morale. They have these things and the rangers do a really good job of it. You can pier someone out.
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:55.000 Meaning we as peers can look at someone that we don't like or that doesn't want to be a part of the team and we can get rid of them.
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:05.000 If you are not a part of the team, you can do it. It is a little bit case by case.
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:34.000 If you are not a part of the team, you can do it.
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:44.000 If you are not going to be a part of the team, you can do it.
01:27:44.000 --> 01:28:00.000 If none of us like echo, it is just to put echo at the bottom, three patrols in the row and you are gone. In the basic seal training, we don't really have a system like that. It takes a little bit more. You have to be a little bit more proactive because it is not just an existing thing.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:15.000 We did have my seal training class. We had one guy that we peered out. My officers got feedback from everyone and said this guy shouldn't be here.
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:39.000 It was not a part of the team. It was not a part of the team.
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:49.000 It was a part of the team. It was a part of the team.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:11.000 It seems like you could do that with a roommate situation.
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:21.000 It was a part of the team.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:46.000 It was a part of the team.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:56.000 It was a part of the team.
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:21.000 It was a part of the team.
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:31.000 It was a part of the team.
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000 It was a part of the team.
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:54.000 It was a part of the team.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:09.000 It was a part of the team.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:25.000 It was a part of the team.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:40.000 It was a part of the team.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:32:07.000 It was a part of the team.
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:22.000 It was a part of the team.
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:47.000 It was a part of the team.
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:57.000 It was a part of the team.
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000 It was a part of the team.
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:29.000 It was a part of the team.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:44.000 It was a part of the team.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:34:11.000 It was a part of the team.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:26.000 It was a part of the team.
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:50.000 It was a part of the team.
01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:15.000 It was a part of the team.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:25.000 It was a part of the team.
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000 It was a part of the team.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:45.000 It was a part of the team.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:54.000 It was a part of the team.
01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:09.000 It was a part of the team.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:34.000 It was a part of the team.
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:49.000 It was a part of the team.
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000 It was a part of the team.
01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:09.000 It was a part of the team.
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:34.000 It was a part of the team.
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:44.000 It was a part of the team.
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000 It was a part of the team.
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:58.000 It was a part of the team.
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:13.000 It was a part of the team.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:36.000 It was a part of the team.
01:38:36.000 --> 01:39:01.000 It was a part of the team.
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:26.000 It was a part of the team.
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:51.000 It was a part of the team.
01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:06.000 It was a part of the team.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000 It was a part of the team.
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000 It was a part of the team.
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:33.000 It was a part of the team.
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:44.000 It was a part of the team.
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:59.000 It was a part of the team.
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:12.000 It was a part of the team.
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:27.000 It was a part of the team.
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000 It was a part of the team.
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:47.000 It was a part of the team.
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:56.000 It was a part of the team.
01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:21.000 It was a part of the team.
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:46.000 It was a part of the team.
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:56.000 It was a part of the team.
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000 It was a part of the team.
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000 It was a part of the team.
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:21.000 It was a part of the team.
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:30.000 It was a part of the team.
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:55.000 It was a part of the team.
01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:10.000 It was a part of the team.
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000 It was a part of the team.
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:40.000 It was a part of the team.
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:50.000 It was a part of the team.
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000 It was a part of the team.
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:04.000 It was a part of the team.
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:14.000 It was a part of the team.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000 It was a part of the team.
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:26.000 It was a part of the team.
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:51.000 It was a part of the team.
01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:05.000 It was a part of the team.
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000 It was a part of the team.
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000 It was a part of the team.
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:24.000 It was a part of the team.
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:45.000 It was a part of the team.
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.24 And so when is the matter just fighting because they're ordered to he literally says that I come on bro
01:46:49.56 --> 01:46:55.82 That's not that that doesn't work that doesn't work in America and in you know you talk like look at that
01:46:55.82 --> 01:47:00.72 That letter I read from the beginning. That's kind of why I wanted to read that letter as a con as a
01:47:01.22 --> 01:47:06.000 Contradiction to this and as an I mean what he says in that letter is
01:47:06.40 --> 01:47:12.70 Like look I'm not fighting for the great of England. He says that but he's fighting for the cause of security for his family
01:47:12.90 --> 01:47:14.90 right so
01:47:14.90 --> 01:47:18.10 People are thinking about that you don't you don't you don't
01:47:19.26 --> 01:47:27.88 Say I'm willing to die just because some random dude ordered me to do it. No you have to have a connection to something greater than that
01:47:27.88 --> 01:47:30.90 Otherwise you're you're suicidal right?
01:47:30.90 --> 01:47:31.90 Yeah
01:47:31.90 --> 01:47:36.24 Yeah, remember saving private Ryan. Yes, he said there's a movie. Yes
01:47:37.52 --> 01:47:43.78 Tell me, he's right. He's like I don't know who Ryan. You know they got a safe private Ryan
01:47:43.78 --> 01:47:47.14 Obviously and they're at this part
01:47:47.78 --> 01:47:52.66 Where they're kind of questioning things you know guys, you know morale is breaking down
01:47:53.94 --> 01:48:00.34 And you know things happen and what he says in part of his speech was like hey, I don't know who private Ryan is. I don't know him
01:48:01.26 --> 01:48:03.26 So I basically questioning that
01:48:03.90 --> 01:48:10.78 Particular cause but he said but if going and rescuing him earns me the right to get back to my family then that's my mission
01:48:10.78 --> 01:48:17.58 So same deal same deal is the letter at that cost. Yes. He had his caught. Oh, yeah, and now is the one he was fighting for
01:48:18.70 --> 01:48:20.70 here
01:48:20.98 --> 01:48:28.54 Back to the book nevertheless nothing which has been stated here must be interpreted as minimizing the influence of cause on those officers and men who are moved by it
01:48:28.54 --> 01:48:32.86 So then he he brings it back a little bit for these few cause will be a
01:48:33.22 --> 01:48:38.46 sustaining and strengthening factor and maybe of greater importance to them than any of the other four factors
01:48:38.46 --> 01:48:44.66 There are times when a few men will be gripped by a cause and will perform astonishing deeds of heroism to further it
01:48:44.66 --> 01:48:53.46 Such men do not require the ordinary bonds of discipline which unite and strengthen others their devotion to the cause is in itself all sufficient
01:48:54.26 --> 01:48:59.46 Nor do they require the same kind of leader that has been described name themselves will all be leaders
01:49:00.06 --> 01:49:02.74 Such men may be properly described as
01:49:02.74 --> 01:49:09.02 Gorilla or irregular fort fighters fanatically devoted to a political religious or national ideal
01:49:09.26 --> 01:49:14.86 They must not be confused with conscript soldiers to whom this paper applies
01:49:16.30 --> 01:49:20.50 So there you go. I mean in America, you know, we have all volunteer
01:49:21.22 --> 01:49:28.58 But I'm telling you even it doesn't matter if you've got it you people have to understand there has to be some kind of a deeper causes to what you're doing
01:49:28.58 --> 01:49:35.38 Or else you're gonna have real problems sure you can order people if they're constrips and you can punish them if they don't do you what you're gonna tell if they don't do
01:49:35.38 --> 01:49:39.10 What you tell them to do you can punish them that is a way
01:49:40.22 --> 01:49:47.30 But that is not going to be a successful way, you know, that is not gonna be the ideal way and by the way
01:49:48.18 --> 01:49:51.70 If you're not using the ideal way you may win
01:49:51.70 --> 01:49:57.80 But if you're going you can somebody that is using the ideal way that has a cause that they believe in and on top of that
01:49:57.80 --> 01:50:03.16 Cause they have all these other things that the group that has a real cause will win every single time
01:50:06.56 --> 01:50:12.68 Now there's some other contributory factors that he brings up here one is success. This is a real
01:50:13.68 --> 01:50:18.88 obvious one success. Hymeralaz is possible in defeat, but not during a long period of defeat
01:50:18.88 --> 01:50:25.52 On such occasions confidence and leaders will never be wane and the first basis will be undermined success
01:50:25.52 --> 01:50:32.20 Will aid good morale by creating confidence in the leader and in the command this factor requires no enlargement
01:50:34.60 --> 01:50:36.92 Next one is regimental tradition
01:50:37.24 --> 01:50:40.96 Regimental spirit can be a powerful factor in making for a good morale
01:50:41.60 --> 01:50:49.28 The more a soldier feels himself to be identified with his regiment the higher will be his morale if the four essential conditions have been fulfilled
01:50:49.52 --> 01:50:51.52 It must be realized however
01:50:51.52 --> 01:50:57.16 That not only that there can be a good morale without strong regimental feelings
01:50:57.28 --> 01:51:03.78 But that regiments with great tradition do not necessarily always produce good battalions
01:51:04.96 --> 01:51:11.12 So the tradition which there's some units that have awesome traditions and
01:51:11.12 --> 01:51:20.72 You know being with some of those some of those units overseas. I mean the first the 506 obviously comes to comes to light and their
01:51:22.44 --> 01:51:26.64 Their tradition the hundred and first everyone tradition was so thick
01:51:27.40 --> 01:51:31.58 There's that pride was in every soldier that that war that
01:51:32.36 --> 01:51:38.48 That ace of spades that that spade on their gear was like yeah, there's pride there. There's tradition
01:51:38.48 --> 01:51:46.72 But he's saying it's not gonna replace these other things, but it is a factor that you can use another factor
01:51:48.08 --> 01:51:50.08 Again contribute to a factor
01:51:51.52 --> 01:51:53.52 Personal happiness
01:51:55.28 --> 01:51:58.96 A man should be happy in the sense that his personal life should be in order
01:52:00.40 --> 01:52:03.000 Nothing weakens a man more than trouble at home
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.28 It encourages it encourages him to think of home and all that it implies when he should be occupied with the enemy
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:17.80 It turns his mind to peace and his desire to live at the moment when it is necessary for him to steal himself to face the
01:52:17.96 --> 01:52:26.000 Possibility of death. He must never be allowed to forget that it is his job to fight the function is to kill the enemy and in doing so
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000 He must expose himself to danger
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:35.16 Anything which weakens his will to fight and expose himself must be considered to lower his morale
01:52:35.68 --> 01:52:44.16 A soldier is only a family man after he is a soldier. He must look forward at the enemy and not back towards home
01:52:49.28 --> 01:52:51.60 Some realism to that definitely
01:52:51.60 --> 01:52:58.16 I think it can go either way. I think there's times where people can be driven
01:52:58.96 --> 01:53:02.08 to success by their family back home
01:53:02.08 --> 01:53:04.88 I think in their family, but it can definitely become a distraction
01:53:05.12 --> 01:53:10.56 Yeah, it's a situation. Yeah, it seems like when there's a lot of risk involved it'll be a description is a
01:53:10.96 --> 01:53:12.96 Destruction
01:53:13.84 --> 01:53:15.44 Maybe
01:53:15.44 --> 01:53:18.16 I think it depends on the individual like it depends on the circumstances
01:53:18.16 --> 01:53:20.16 I think
01:53:20.16 --> 01:53:25.52 What may be better to look whether it's a distraction on is it like what's going on at home?
01:53:25.52 --> 01:53:28.08 That's what's more important if there's disruption at home
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:29.60 That's a problem
01:53:29.60 --> 01:53:34.72 Right if you got a guy that's overseas and there's problems in the family life
01:53:35.36 --> 01:53:37.36 That's what that's gonna hurt. Yeah
01:53:38.32 --> 01:53:42.16 Yeah, it's weird because like you know guys that work sometimes anyway
01:53:43.92 --> 01:53:45.92 Sometimes
01:53:45.92 --> 01:53:50.000 You know they is something back can be going on at home. Yeah, they'll use work to sort of
01:53:50.64 --> 01:53:54.24 Cover it up like playing in their mind. You know there'll be like hey that like
01:53:55.12 --> 01:53:59.44 Again, I'm sorry for another movie reference, but there's something called true lies Arnold's
01:53:59.44 --> 01:54:00.72 We're today. I've seen those
01:54:00.80 --> 01:54:06.96 He goes yeah, so Arnold I haven't seen it enough times it came out 20 years ago to be pulling our quote
01:54:07.52 --> 01:54:11.76 And story line, but hey, let's go with it. It's kind of he said the point of this one but he goes
01:54:11.76 --> 01:54:16.80 Uh, you know Arnold finds out that his wife is or thinks that is why she's cheating on him with it
01:54:16.80 --> 01:54:18.80 Like and then the partner
01:54:19.20 --> 01:54:25.52 Tom Arnold goes he's all let's just focus on work. That's what I'll that's what I always do when my life turns to dog shit
01:54:25.52 --> 01:54:30.96 I just focus on work. Yeah, you know well, but and the the point is like some people that's how you know
01:54:30.96 --> 01:54:35.04 Something's going wrong at home. No, but like you know, I'm just focused on work screw that that's forget about it
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:38.72 You know, I'm immersed myself. Yeah, because I think you can control work. Yeah
01:54:38.72 --> 01:54:43.52 You might not be able to control your relationship the way you think you should be able to yeah, huh? So
01:54:45.12 --> 01:54:49.20 Continuing on all soldiers do not have morale affected by home troubles
01:54:49.84 --> 01:54:55.84 Some men thrive on unhappiness and fight all the more fiercely because they hold a bitter a secret bitterness with that
01:54:55.84 --> 01:54:56.64 them
01:54:56.64 --> 01:54:59.60 Such men are the minority that's the person you just talked about right?
01:54:59.60 --> 01:55:05.12 Hey, I was gonna go work harder, but it's such men are the minority, but they are a large minority
01:55:05.12 --> 01:55:09.52 They are a reminder that happiness cannot buy itself produce good morale
01:55:10.88 --> 01:55:17.04 Next is administration of men's ordinary day-to-day life must be well organized thus hard conditions imposed on him
01:55:17.04 --> 01:55:22.72 Intraining to inculcate discipline do not rule out the desire ability of good living quarters and
01:55:23.44 --> 01:55:28.16 In the line a soldiers morale will be much improved if the administration
01:55:28.40 --> 01:55:34.56 Administrative arrangements are good and if he is assured of proper conditions with a reasonable amount of
01:55:34.56 --> 01:55:37.12 Leisure and comfort when he leaves the front
01:55:38.72 --> 01:55:40.72 Leisure day
01:55:40.72 --> 01:55:42.72 Were you at
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:48.08 Were you at the o'von and then he says this but here a warning must be given
01:55:49.52 --> 01:55:57.76 There is a danger today of welfare being considered as an end in itself and not as a means to an end
01:55:57.76 --> 01:56:06.72 One of the means of maintaining morale welfare by itself will not produce good morale because it is essentially soft
01:56:07.84 --> 01:56:13.28 And it has already been stating that morale cannot be good unless it contains a quality of hardness
01:56:14.40 --> 01:56:15.60 You
01:56:15.60 --> 01:56:24.96 Man you gotta remember that right you gotta remember that you're not ever gonna have good morale unless there's like an element of hardness to it
01:56:24.96 --> 01:56:26.96 and
01:56:27.68 --> 01:56:32.80 Continuing on hardship and privation are the school of the good soldier
01:56:35.76 --> 01:56:38.24 Idleness and luxury are his enemies
01:56:39.84 --> 01:56:45.12 Men will endure great hardships if they know why and are convinced of the necessity
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.72 Blood toil tears and sweat is not for nothing
01:56:48.72 --> 01:56:56.80 One of the great rallying calls of the English race gorgings cry guns before butter expressed the same truth
01:56:57.04 --> 01:56:58.64 if men believe in the need
01:56:59.52 --> 01:57:01.52 hardships are in themselves
01:57:01.76 --> 01:57:11.20 Stimulate to morale but the opposite is also true let there be any suggestion that butter can come before guns and the men will at once choose butter
01:57:12.40 --> 01:57:16.24 If this happens there will be no morale in this sense of the definition
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:23.84 Then we get propaganda the uplifting effect of modern propaganda on a soldier is
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:26.40 Perhaps a new development
01:57:26.40 --> 01:57:37.44 A man's morale is raised immensely by the feeling that his efforts are appreciated and applauded not only by his comrades and his officers but also the world at
01:57:37.84 --> 01:57:41.44 Large you gotta you gotta get that propaganda working for you
01:57:41.44 --> 01:57:49.60 I've had a couple companies I've been working with lately and one of them was being assaulted
01:57:50.72 --> 01:57:52.40 by
01:57:52.40 --> 01:57:54.40 It's competitors and
01:57:54.40 --> 01:57:56.40 It had a better product
01:57:56.40 --> 01:58:02.64 It's product was doing well, but they were getting assaulted and they were getting assaulted by the way with lies
01:58:03.84 --> 01:58:08.08 Like the competitors are just making stuff up right making stuff up put that word out there
01:58:08.08 --> 01:58:15.04 Roomers on officially and you know here's the thing the CEO was kind of
01:58:16.16 --> 01:58:23.60 Did most of what you're what to do and I said you have the most how the most powerful tool in your arsenal
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:26.32 It's the truth
01:58:26.32 --> 01:58:32.56 But you gotta weaponize that truth you gotta weaponize it you gotta turn it into a weapon that you can use to crush the lies
01:58:32.96 --> 01:58:36.88 Because if you're doing great things and you're not telling anyone you're not putting out any propaganda
01:58:36.88 --> 01:58:43.04 Well, and guess what no one's gonna know about it. You just lost your your most valuable weapon which is the truth
01:58:43.28 --> 01:58:48.24 If you're doing good things and your product is better and you can prove that it's better and people know that it's better
01:58:48.24 --> 01:58:54.16 But you're not telling anyone you're gonna you it doesn't matter if the weaponize that truth and get it out there
01:58:54.40 --> 01:58:56.40 So that's what propaganda is
01:58:59.68 --> 01:59:02.96 Now we are moving into the conclusion right here
01:59:02.96 --> 01:59:05.84 In brief
01:59:05.84 --> 01:59:12.40 Hi morale has been defined as the quality which makes men in dirt and show courage in times of fatigue and danger
01:59:12.64 --> 01:59:18.80 The cultivation of morale depends upon the training of leaders the inculcation of discipline
01:59:18.80 --> 01:59:25.04 The encouragement of comradeship and the infusing of self respect the leaders must have a belief in their cause
01:59:25.04 --> 01:59:34.000 And they must pay attention to numerous contributory factors of considerable but secondary importance and here's how we close it out
01:59:34.40 --> 01:59:36.88 Man is still the first weapon of war
01:59:38.24 --> 01:59:43.12 His training is the most important consideration in the fashioning of a fighting army
01:59:44.56 --> 01:59:51.52 All modern science is directed toward his assistance, but on his efforts depend the outcome of the battle
01:59:51.52 --> 01:59:59.92 The morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:08.40 So there he is saying it again the morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war and as I said I will argue with that
02:00:09.84 --> 02:00:14.72 Because as far as I'm concerned without question leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and I'm actually like I said
02:00:14.72 --> 02:00:16.72 I'm thinking I'm right
02:00:16.72 --> 02:00:19.76 So no offense to Monty, but I think I'm right because
02:00:19.76 --> 02:00:23.28 If he's his factors to review them leadership
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.84 That's the number one factor. Well, that's leadership
02:00:27.04 --> 02:00:28.72 Discipline where does that come from
02:00:29.12 --> 02:00:30.84 Discipline comes from leadership?
02:00:30.96 --> 02:00:32.72 Kamradi Ship where does that come from?
02:00:33.28 --> 02:00:34.64 it comes from good leadership
02:00:34.84 --> 02:00:37.66 Self respect where does that come from in this I'm not
02:00:37.66 --> 02:00:41.44 I'm not saying that this is what Monty saying Monty said that discipline comes from leadership
02:00:41.76 --> 02:00:46.96 Monty said that Kamradi ship comes from leadership Monty said that self respect comes from leadership
02:00:46.96 --> 02:00:50.58 So as far as I'm concerned, no offense,
02:00:50.58 --> 02:00:53.82 it's far as I'm concerned, leadership is the most important thing
02:00:53.82 --> 02:00:56.98 on the battlefield, but that being said,
02:00:56.98 --> 02:01:00.06 let there be no doubt that morale without question
02:01:00.06 --> 02:01:03.98 is necessity and a requirement for victory.
02:01:03.98 --> 02:01:05.76 And I will add this.
02:01:07.52 --> 02:01:09.26 morale is important.
02:01:10.40 --> 02:01:13.62 Extremely important, not only for a team,
02:01:13.62 --> 02:01:16.82 not only for a military unit or a business
02:01:16.82 --> 02:01:19.46 or any kind of organization made up of people,
02:01:19.46 --> 02:01:24.46 but morale is also important for individuals.
02:01:27.18 --> 02:01:32.18 For us day to day, how is your morale?
02:01:32.18 --> 02:01:33.86 Where's your morale at?
02:01:33.86 --> 02:01:35.34 Think about how you approach the day
02:01:35.34 --> 02:01:36.58 when your morale is good.
02:01:36.58 --> 02:01:39.38 Think about how you go into the day.
02:01:39.38 --> 02:01:40.66 Just like you're going into attack.
02:01:40.66 --> 02:01:42.26 If you're going to attack the enemy
02:01:42.26 --> 02:01:44.18 and your morale is high,
02:01:44.18 --> 02:01:45.82 you're going to attack with vigor.
02:01:45.82 --> 02:01:47.46 And you're probably going to be successful.
02:01:47.46 --> 02:01:49.74 If you go in to attack the enemy
02:01:49.74 --> 02:01:51.14 and your morale is low,
02:01:51.14 --> 02:01:53.10 you're going to attack without vigor,
02:01:53.10 --> 02:01:54.38 without enthusiasm.
02:01:55.50 --> 02:01:57.02 And you're probably going to fail.
02:01:57.02 --> 02:01:59.46 Well, what about you as a person?
02:01:59.46 --> 02:02:02.10 If your morale is low, guess what?
02:02:02.10 --> 02:02:03.78 If you roll into the day,
02:02:03.78 --> 02:02:05.66 you roll into your mission,
02:02:05.66 --> 02:02:07.22 and your morale is low,
02:02:07.22 --> 02:02:09.18 likely you are going to fail.
02:02:09.18 --> 02:02:12.70 So then the question is,
02:02:12.70 --> 02:02:15.86 how do we increase our personal,
02:02:15.86 --> 02:02:17.46 individual morale?
02:02:17.46 --> 02:02:20.46 And I think it's the same way we improve team morale.
02:02:22.14 --> 02:02:26.54 We improve our personal morale with discipline,
02:02:28.66 --> 02:02:31.82 with hardship and with privation
02:02:31.82 --> 02:02:35.10 and with efficiency and with emotional control
02:02:35.10 --> 02:02:37.78 and by facing our fears and, of course,
02:02:37.78 --> 02:02:40.78 most important is leadership.
02:02:43.66 --> 02:02:46.54 Leadership leading yourself and not allowing
02:02:46.54 --> 02:02:49.58 this leadership vacuum in your head,
02:02:51.70 --> 02:02:54.34 right when I was putting seals through training,
02:02:54.34 --> 02:02:55.70 parking the day.
02:02:55.70 --> 02:02:57.34 If there was chaos broke out,
02:02:57.34 --> 02:02:59.30 there were sometimes where no leader would step up
02:02:59.30 --> 02:03:02.22 and take charge and that would create a leadership vacuum.
02:03:02.22 --> 02:03:03.70 And it was hard to tell what was happening
02:03:03.70 --> 02:03:05.98 because no one would be saying anything.
02:03:05.98 --> 02:03:09.42 It would just be silence and you didn't hear anything.
02:03:09.42 --> 02:03:11.70 And so it's hard to recognize that all of a sudden,
02:03:11.70 --> 02:03:13.14 wait a second, there's no one's leading.
02:03:13.14 --> 02:03:14.86 You don't recognize it because it's not happening.
02:03:14.86 --> 02:03:16.54 It's like seeing something that's not there.
02:03:16.54 --> 02:03:18.26 It's not there, so you don't think about it.
02:03:18.26 --> 02:03:19.38 Well, no one's leading.
02:03:19.38 --> 02:03:22.30 Take sometimes it can be hard to notice that.
02:03:22.30 --> 02:03:23.66 And I'd call that a leadership vacuum
02:03:23.66 --> 02:03:24.78 and I teach these young seals like,
02:03:24.78 --> 02:03:26.82 hey, when that happens, you need to step up.
02:03:26.82 --> 02:03:28.30 Well, the same thing can happen in your head.
02:03:28.30 --> 02:03:29.86 You get this leadership vacuum in your head
02:03:29.86 --> 02:03:30.86 when you're not leading.
02:03:30.86 --> 02:03:32.86 You're going to start to slide down the path
02:03:32.86 --> 02:03:35.10 of least resistance.
02:03:35.10 --> 02:03:40.10 You're going to slip on down that slippery slope.
02:03:40.10 --> 02:03:41.66 You're going to walk away from discipline.
02:03:41.66 --> 02:03:45.74 You're going to not impose hardship and privation
02:03:45.74 --> 02:03:46.66 on yourself.
02:03:46.66 --> 02:03:48.66 You're not going to push yourself.
02:03:48.66 --> 02:03:53.26 And your morale is going to go down as well.
02:03:53.26 --> 02:03:56.70 And if your morale fails well,
02:03:56.70 --> 02:04:01.46 becomes very easy for you to fail.
02:04:01.46 --> 02:04:03.14 Don't allow that.
02:04:03.14 --> 02:04:05.62 Don't allow your morale to fail.
02:04:05.62 --> 02:04:07.22 Lift up your morale.
02:04:07.22 --> 02:04:13.22 Increase your morale by inflicting yourself with discipline.
02:04:16.66 --> 02:04:19.98 By doing hard things, by controlling your emotions,
02:04:19.98 --> 02:04:23.66 by controlling yourself, and by leading yourself
02:04:23.66 --> 02:04:31.10 on the path of discipline, which as we know.
02:04:31.10 --> 02:04:34.58 At least to freedom.
02:04:34.58 --> 02:04:38.86 And I think that's actually all I've got.
02:04:38.86 --> 02:04:42.14 Fort tonight, so, echo Charles.
02:04:42.14 --> 02:04:49.10 Speaking of controlling ourselves and leading ourselves
02:04:49.10 --> 02:04:52.10 down the path.
02:04:52.10 --> 02:04:55.38 I know you've got some, let's say, some guide posts
02:04:55.38 --> 02:04:59.94 on the path, some markers on the path, some signals
02:04:59.94 --> 02:05:03.66 pointing in the right direction to get us down the path.
02:05:03.66 --> 02:05:06.94 Yeah, so I'll sing about this tuddony.
02:05:06.94 --> 02:05:10.70 I'm watching my daughter's performance.
02:05:10.70 --> 02:05:11.82 Little singing performance.
02:05:11.82 --> 02:05:12.34 Check.
02:05:12.34 --> 02:05:12.98 Does this morning?
02:05:12.98 --> 02:05:14.18 All good.
02:05:14.18 --> 02:05:15.98 So for what reason?
02:05:15.98 --> 02:05:16.34 Good.
02:05:16.34 --> 02:05:17.34 Fine.
02:05:17.34 --> 02:05:19.58 It was a big group of what grade?
02:05:19.58 --> 02:05:20.34 Can't do that.
02:05:20.34 --> 02:05:24.22 No, what grade did you give her when she was done?
02:05:24.22 --> 02:05:25.70 I didn't give a grade.
02:05:25.70 --> 02:05:28.94 How should I know how she's going to improve her performance?
02:05:28.94 --> 02:05:30.62 I'll give her a grade when she gets home.
02:05:30.62 --> 02:05:31.62 Check.
02:05:31.62 --> 02:05:32.62 Okay.
02:05:32.62 --> 02:05:33.62 Good.
02:05:33.62 --> 02:05:34.62 What you're going to give her a grade?
02:05:34.62 --> 02:05:37.38 Probably F for sure, because it's a long story.
02:05:37.38 --> 02:05:39.42 That's beside the point, by the way.
02:05:39.42 --> 02:05:42.26 So an F, probably F, what'd you do?
02:05:42.26 --> 02:05:48.58 Just, it was, there were some things that happened post-performance.
02:05:48.58 --> 02:05:49.58 What?
02:05:49.58 --> 02:05:50.58 That tears?
02:05:50.58 --> 02:05:53.50 That I didn't approve of the reason for the math.
02:05:53.50 --> 02:05:54.50 Okay.
02:05:54.50 --> 02:05:55.50 Tell me anyway.
02:05:55.50 --> 02:05:57.46 Anyway, so that I will go over that later.
02:05:57.46 --> 02:06:01.50 So the point is, I'm thinking, what is the path?
02:06:01.50 --> 02:06:05.30 This is probably the first time I've ever wanted you to go to detail on the story.
02:06:05.30 --> 02:06:08.30 No, no matter.
02:06:08.30 --> 02:06:09.78 Did she freak out?
02:06:09.78 --> 02:06:10.78 No.
02:06:10.78 --> 02:06:11.78 She just gave us a little detail.
02:06:11.78 --> 02:06:12.78 Okay.
02:06:12.78 --> 02:06:13.78 So she's shy.
02:06:13.78 --> 02:06:14.78 She's performing good.
02:06:14.78 --> 02:06:15.78 Fine.
02:06:15.78 --> 02:06:16.78 Like, it's the whole class.
02:06:16.78 --> 02:06:19.22 You know, like, what do you call it?
02:06:19.22 --> 02:06:20.22 And assembly.
02:06:20.22 --> 02:06:21.22 Okay.
02:06:21.22 --> 02:06:22.22 Yeah.
02:06:22.22 --> 02:06:23.22 So we're talking 100 kids on stage.
02:06:23.22 --> 02:06:25.78 Or is it just one class and there's only 25 kids on stage?
02:06:25.78 --> 02:06:26.78 One class.
02:06:26.78 --> 02:06:27.98 And it's not a really a stage.
02:06:27.98 --> 02:06:28.98 It's like, okay.
02:06:28.98 --> 02:06:29.98 It's in the class chart, you know, of course.
02:06:29.98 --> 02:06:30.98 Okay.
02:06:30.98 --> 02:06:32.98 It's a real official scenario.
02:06:32.98 --> 02:06:33.98 Yeah.
02:06:33.98 --> 02:06:36.18 So yeah, they go, they perform good.
02:06:36.18 --> 02:06:37.82 It's for as performance goes fine.
02:06:37.82 --> 02:06:41.38 You know, remember, it's the song she performed in front of us.
02:06:41.38 --> 02:06:42.38 Yep.
02:06:42.38 --> 02:06:44.90 You know, the night before, and the night before that, she'll go good.
02:06:44.90 --> 02:06:49.98 Oh, but then they had to sit down and then the assembly sort of went on.
02:06:49.98 --> 02:06:54.34 So they're sitting down and I look over and I see your crying, which I didn't.
02:06:54.34 --> 02:06:58.58 I was confused, but I know my daughter, like she's like, she's softy like that.
02:06:58.58 --> 02:06:59.58 My fault.
02:06:59.58 --> 02:07:00.58 I know.
02:07:00.58 --> 02:07:03.58 So she's looking back on me.
02:07:03.58 --> 02:07:07.30 She's looking back to me all salty.
02:07:07.30 --> 02:07:13.58 And I'm like, I'm not concerned because I know something didn't go wrong.
02:07:13.58 --> 02:07:15.46 Something's happening that she just doesn't like.
02:07:15.46 --> 02:07:16.82 Like she's tired of sitting there.
02:07:16.82 --> 02:07:17.82 Okay.
02:07:17.82 --> 02:07:18.82 Or something like that.
02:07:18.82 --> 02:07:19.82 So she's looking back at me.
02:07:19.82 --> 02:07:22.94 I'm just like, you know, I don't give it that much attention later on.
02:07:22.94 --> 02:07:26.06 I find out as she's walking to her class because I feel assembly.
02:07:26.06 --> 02:07:27.38 They go to their class.
02:07:27.38 --> 02:07:32.18 And she's like, oh, yeah, I didn't like how long the assembly was going on.
02:07:32.18 --> 02:07:33.54 That's what she said to me.
02:07:33.54 --> 02:07:34.86 Yeah, that's why she was crying.
02:07:34.86 --> 02:07:35.86 That's why she's crying.
02:07:35.86 --> 02:07:36.86 Yeah, yeah.
02:07:36.86 --> 02:07:37.86 Yeah, true.
02:07:37.86 --> 02:07:43.26 And here's the thing, it she shouldn't feel that strongly about it.
02:07:43.26 --> 02:07:45.70 You know, there's something else going on to be honest with you, bro.
02:07:45.70 --> 02:07:49.02 I, she, she's like, softy.
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:52.54 She's like, I like, it one thing's don't go her way in certain ways.
02:07:52.54 --> 02:07:54.94 So, you know, and she's uncomfortable or whatever.
02:07:54.94 --> 02:07:57.26 So if I were you, how'd break it down like this?
02:07:57.26 --> 02:07:59.54 I wouldn't just give her an F across the board.
02:07:59.54 --> 02:08:04.06 I would give her like a breakout, maybe some different categories.
02:08:04.06 --> 02:08:08.10 I'd give her like an A for singing or maybe a B.
02:08:08.10 --> 02:08:09.10 You know what I mean?
02:08:09.10 --> 02:08:10.66 Cause I'd probably not hit never know, right?
02:08:10.66 --> 02:08:13.02 Maybe a B minus or whatever.
02:08:13.02 --> 02:08:14.78 And then give her, you know, presence.
02:08:14.78 --> 02:08:17.06 I used to, this is how I used to grade my kids when they were do stuff like this.
02:08:17.06 --> 02:08:18.46 I'd give them presence.
02:08:18.46 --> 02:08:19.98 I'd give them attitude.
02:08:19.98 --> 02:08:22.34 I'd give them clarity, anunciation.
02:08:22.34 --> 02:08:24.42 Like there's a bunch of things you can break it down.
02:08:24.42 --> 02:08:28.06 And you don't want to give her five o'clock across the board, obviously.
02:08:28.06 --> 02:08:31.26 Cause you know, five o'clock performer, not an H6, don't exist.
02:08:31.26 --> 02:08:32.26 No, not a bar down.
02:08:32.26 --> 02:08:33.26 It's not a bar down.
02:08:33.26 --> 02:08:34.26 Right.
02:08:34.26 --> 02:08:39.62 So, but then you say listen, by the way, all your performance, which you have, you know,
02:08:39.62 --> 02:08:46.02 you got a 3.8 on, that's your average score, post performance behavior.
02:08:46.02 --> 02:08:48.54 Had to give you a zero, zero.
02:08:48.54 --> 02:08:49.54 Yeah.
02:08:49.54 --> 02:08:50.54 Tears.
02:08:50.54 --> 02:08:51.54 Yeah.
02:08:51.54 --> 02:08:55.46 Don't ever let these other kids know that you've been, you should be having the
02:08:55.46 --> 02:08:56.46 attitude.
02:08:56.46 --> 02:08:58.54 I could stand out here, I could sit out here all day and say, really bring it.
02:08:58.54 --> 02:08:59.54 Check.
02:08:59.54 --> 02:09:00.54 All right.
02:09:00.54 --> 02:09:01.54 It's way.
02:09:01.54 --> 02:09:05.26 So as this is unfolding, oh, this is more to the story.
02:09:05.26 --> 02:09:06.26 Okay.
02:09:06.26 --> 02:09:07.26 Well, that wasn't the point.
02:09:07.26 --> 02:09:08.26 Yeah.
02:09:08.26 --> 02:09:09.26 That was just a setting.
02:09:09.26 --> 02:09:10.26 Yeah.
02:09:10.26 --> 02:09:14.66 But I was just thinking, like, what is the path?
02:09:14.66 --> 02:09:15.66 Like, what is that?
02:09:15.66 --> 02:09:18.46 Is it just the stuff that Jocco does and now we do it?
02:09:18.46 --> 02:09:19.46 No.
02:09:19.46 --> 02:09:20.46 It's not that.
02:09:20.46 --> 02:09:29.50 Actually, right, it's some of the stuff you do in my opinion is essential quintessential.
02:09:29.50 --> 02:09:30.50 Yeah.
02:09:30.50 --> 02:09:31.50 It's like ideal.
02:09:31.50 --> 02:09:32.50 Right.
02:09:32.50 --> 02:09:33.50 That's what I think that's my opinion.
02:09:33.50 --> 02:09:34.50 I'm trying.
02:09:34.50 --> 02:09:36.50 I'm missing by a lot.
02:09:36.50 --> 02:09:37.90 My, you know, I'm coming in.
02:09:37.90 --> 02:09:38.90 I saw it too too.
02:09:38.90 --> 02:09:39.90 Most, most people.
02:09:39.90 --> 02:09:40.90 Oh, yeah.
02:09:40.90 --> 02:09:43.38 But that's just you being hard on the stand, on the scale.
02:09:43.38 --> 02:09:44.38 Right on yourself.
02:09:44.38 --> 02:09:45.38 No.
02:09:45.38 --> 02:09:46.38 Put it this way.
02:09:46.38 --> 02:09:50.42 The path is something specific, but more than that, I just, I just realized,
02:09:50.42 --> 02:09:54.86 not realized, but more like consciously thought of what's not the path.
02:09:54.86 --> 02:09:56.58 That's what, that's important.
02:09:56.58 --> 02:09:59.26 So it's like, okay, if you're doing Jocco, are you not on the path?
02:09:59.26 --> 02:10:00.26 Not necessarily.
02:10:00.26 --> 02:10:05.62 You have to be doing or neglecting some very specific things to not be on the path.
02:10:05.62 --> 02:10:09.74 Like if you don't care about what you're eating, like you're just like whatever.
02:10:09.74 --> 02:10:11.94 Feel sounds good tonight.
02:10:11.94 --> 02:10:18.18 That's told the total standard in which you base your meals on.
02:10:18.18 --> 02:10:19.58 You're probably not on the path.
02:10:19.58 --> 02:10:20.58 That's a big indicator.
02:10:20.58 --> 02:10:22.06 Well, you're one of the factors.
02:10:22.06 --> 02:10:23.82 It's an area where you need to tighten things up.
02:10:23.82 --> 02:10:24.82 Yes.
02:10:24.82 --> 02:10:27.62 Because we know you're not performing optimally if you're not eating correctly.
02:10:27.62 --> 02:10:28.62 Yeah.
02:10:28.62 --> 02:10:32.34 So we'll just say that element is considered not on the path.
02:10:32.34 --> 02:10:33.34 Right.
02:10:33.34 --> 02:10:35.34 So that's just one example of many.
02:10:35.34 --> 02:10:37.46 You know, like if you just straight up don't exercise.
02:10:37.46 --> 02:10:38.46 I don't.
02:10:38.46 --> 02:10:39.46 Yeah.
02:10:39.46 --> 02:10:42.50 And some people have active lifestyles in general and they don't consider it, quote,
02:10:42.50 --> 02:10:43.50 I'm quote, exercise.
02:10:43.50 --> 02:10:45.66 I get it, but then that's different or whatever.
02:10:45.66 --> 02:10:48.10 But if you're like inactive, you're sedentary.
02:10:48.10 --> 02:10:49.10 Yeah.
02:10:49.10 --> 02:10:51.94 That quality is not on the path.
02:10:51.94 --> 02:10:52.94 True.
02:10:52.94 --> 02:10:58.10 So basically what is not on the path is if you have most of the elements of your life
02:10:58.10 --> 02:10:59.50 is not on the path.
02:10:59.50 --> 02:11:00.78 You'll know.
02:11:00.78 --> 02:11:05.18 Also, there's also a really broad thing because you could.
02:11:05.18 --> 02:11:10.70 You don't even if you're, even if you're trying, right?
02:11:10.70 --> 02:11:11.70 That's what the path is.
02:11:11.70 --> 02:11:12.70 Right.
02:11:12.70 --> 02:11:14.42 The path is like, hey, I'm trying.
02:11:14.42 --> 02:11:17.42 Now I guess, yeah, I guess that's a little bit strong.
02:11:17.42 --> 02:11:20.98 I guess I am trying to work out, but I just didn't get it again today.
02:11:20.98 --> 02:11:23.14 So yeah, you know what, you're not on the path.
02:11:23.14 --> 02:11:24.14 That's a good point.
02:11:24.14 --> 02:11:25.14 Yes.
02:11:25.14 --> 02:11:31.66 But you don't have to be, you know, doing the nine hour workout with a six hour
02:11:31.66 --> 02:11:33.06 GJ2 session afterwards.
02:11:33.06 --> 02:11:34.06 No.
02:11:34.06 --> 02:11:35.06 Oh, you only had an hour.
02:11:35.06 --> 02:11:36.78 You only had 30 minutes to train today.
02:11:36.78 --> 02:11:37.78 Cool.
02:11:37.78 --> 02:11:38.78 Got it done quick.
02:11:38.78 --> 02:11:39.78 I did a pretty quick.
02:11:39.78 --> 02:11:40.78 I did 20 minutes today.
02:11:40.78 --> 02:11:41.78 That's what I got to.
02:11:41.78 --> 02:11:43.94 I got flew in late last night.
02:11:43.94 --> 02:11:44.94 Welcome this morning.
02:11:44.94 --> 02:11:45.94 I had another call.
02:11:45.94 --> 02:11:46.94 So I was like, okay, cool.
02:11:46.94 --> 02:11:48.34 I'm going to hammer this thing out.
02:11:48.34 --> 02:11:50.02 I had that window closing too.
02:11:50.02 --> 02:11:52.30 You know, the windows like, well, maybe I'll just pull.
02:11:52.30 --> 02:11:53.30 Oh, yeah.
02:11:53.30 --> 02:11:54.30 That's real.
02:11:54.30 --> 02:11:55.74 Just to me, this is, you know, no, no.
02:11:55.74 --> 02:11:57.98 You can't let the window close.
02:11:57.98 --> 02:11:59.38 That was a really good concept.
02:11:59.38 --> 02:12:01.02 We talked about the GJ2 window.
02:12:01.02 --> 02:12:02.02 Yes.
02:12:02.02 --> 02:12:04.58 It happens with working out too, right?
02:12:04.58 --> 02:12:06.74 Even though that's mostly self imposed.
02:12:06.74 --> 02:12:09.82 It is mostly self imposed for working out, but it does happen.
02:12:09.82 --> 02:12:13.70 If you have work to do a legitimate work, you have meetings, you have calls.
02:12:13.70 --> 02:12:16.90 And you're like, well, you know, I took that one call or I woke up the
02:12:16.90 --> 02:12:19.46 morning and all well, you know, I got that call on it.
02:12:19.46 --> 02:12:22.94 Wait a second, I, you know, I brushing my teeth and wait a second, I'm going to just
02:12:22.94 --> 02:12:23.94 go check my email.
02:12:23.94 --> 02:12:25.34 Oh, now the window, it's all the window.
02:12:25.34 --> 02:12:26.34 No, no, no, no, just shut down.
02:12:26.34 --> 02:12:28.42 I'm going to have to work out later, which will never happen.
02:12:28.42 --> 02:12:29.42 Yeah.
02:12:29.42 --> 02:12:30.42 Don't let the window shut.
02:12:30.42 --> 02:12:31.74 Yeah, just, yeah, jump through it.
02:12:31.74 --> 02:12:33.10 Yeah, jump through the window.
02:12:33.10 --> 02:12:34.10 Jump cool.
02:12:34.10 --> 02:12:36.38 But hey, man.
02:12:36.38 --> 02:12:42.02 And to recognize what the path isn't is just important as recognizing what the path
02:12:42.02 --> 02:12:43.02 is.
02:12:43.02 --> 02:12:45.22 Because if you're like, hey, are you trying to, like, I don't know.
02:12:45.22 --> 02:12:49.02 I mean, what are people saying, like, are you trying to improve yourself or whatever?
02:12:49.02 --> 02:12:52.70 Most people would say, yes, yeah, it would be like, oh, yeah, look at all the things.
02:12:52.70 --> 02:12:56.10 But it's like, you kind of know, you know, like, it's different.
02:12:56.10 --> 02:12:57.10 You just sort of know.
02:12:57.10 --> 02:12:58.10 Yeah.
02:12:58.10 --> 02:13:02.10 Like, if you're doing due to your sort on the path with that alone, maybe not fully,
02:13:02.10 --> 02:13:04.26 but that is a legitimate element.
02:13:04.26 --> 02:13:08.22 So when you do due to it, if you're new or not new, whatever, you're going to need
02:13:08.22 --> 02:13:09.22 a geek.
02:13:09.22 --> 02:13:10.22 Yeah.
02:13:10.22 --> 02:13:11.22 One gear, we're getting.
02:13:11.22 --> 02:13:13.70 I think we all know origin because they're the best geese.
02:13:13.70 --> 02:13:15.70 So how are they the best geese?
02:13:15.70 --> 02:13:16.70 Okay.
02:13:16.70 --> 02:13:19.34 So if you just put one on, you'll sort of know, but here's the indicator.
02:13:19.34 --> 02:13:20.74 Won't go too deep into it.
02:13:20.74 --> 02:13:22.74 But coach Adam.
02:13:22.74 --> 02:13:23.74 Mm-hmm.
02:13:23.74 --> 02:13:27.70 The same coach in way or the way or your kid, by the way, there's a real coach Adam.
02:13:27.70 --> 02:13:32.14 So coach Adam puts on his rift gear inside out.
02:13:32.14 --> 02:13:33.14 Top.
02:13:33.14 --> 02:13:34.14 Yeah.
02:13:34.14 --> 02:13:35.14 The gear top inside out.
02:13:35.14 --> 02:13:36.34 I think he thought it was correct.
02:13:36.34 --> 02:13:37.34 Yeah.
02:13:37.34 --> 02:13:40.06 And that was indicative of just, because it shows the stitching.
02:13:40.06 --> 02:13:41.06 Yeah.
02:13:41.06 --> 02:13:42.06 Yeah.
02:13:42.06 --> 02:13:43.06 And I looked at it.
02:13:43.06 --> 02:13:44.06 I looked at that.
02:13:44.06 --> 02:13:45.06 It looks kind of cool, right?
02:13:45.06 --> 02:13:46.06 Yeah.
02:13:46.06 --> 02:13:51.06 What I grew up in because Pete was saying, he took the genes, origin genes, which are now out.
02:13:51.06 --> 02:13:55.06 And he was expeeed, turned, or he said, hey, if you want to know what the quality of these
02:13:55.06 --> 02:13:57.06 genes turns them in, he turned them inside out.
02:13:57.06 --> 02:13:58.06 He's like, look at what they're talking for.
02:13:58.06 --> 02:13:59.06 The inside.
02:13:59.06 --> 02:14:00.06 So now you have Adam, who sees that?
02:14:00.06 --> 02:14:03.66 You put this gear on inside out, because the quality is so high that you can't even tell.
02:14:03.66 --> 02:14:05.66 He thought that was the correct way to do it.
02:14:05.66 --> 02:14:06.66 That's what he thought that was going to work.
02:14:06.66 --> 02:14:07.66 It was correct.
02:14:07.66 --> 02:14:09.86 I mean, while the logo was all back written and stuff.
02:14:09.86 --> 02:14:11.26 So, you know, he really shouldn't know that.
02:14:11.26 --> 02:14:14.18 But, you know, hey, teach their own and it looked good either way.
02:14:14.18 --> 02:14:16.38 So that's what we're at with origin.
02:14:16.38 --> 02:14:26.46 We got clothing, including genes, gays, t-shirts, sweatshirts, other stuff.
02:14:26.46 --> 02:14:27.82 And then we got supplements as well.
02:14:27.82 --> 02:14:28.82 Yeah.
02:14:28.82 --> 02:14:29.82 Supplements are good.
02:14:29.82 --> 02:14:30.82 Joint warfare.
02:14:30.82 --> 02:14:32.18 I think I'm talking a Greg Train, right.
02:14:32.18 --> 02:14:33.50 One of our main training partners.
02:14:33.50 --> 02:14:35.50 He has a AC joint situation.
02:14:35.50 --> 02:14:36.50 Yeah.
02:14:36.50 --> 02:14:38.18 Two sides by the way.
02:14:38.18 --> 02:14:45.50 And I'm telling him, if you put together the joint warfare with the superkrill oil discipline
02:14:45.50 --> 02:14:49.58 every single day, that thing will heal straight up faster, measureably fast.
02:14:49.58 --> 02:14:50.58 100%.
02:14:50.58 --> 02:14:53.10 Then just look at my knee situation.
02:14:53.10 --> 02:14:55.46 Which, man, I'm a believer now.
02:14:55.46 --> 02:14:57.70 You're now a believer.
02:14:57.70 --> 02:15:04.86 I'm increased my beliefs of my own personal kind of like Wolverine healing powers.
02:15:04.86 --> 02:15:05.86 Yeah.
02:15:05.86 --> 02:15:06.94 And I've been choked about before even that wasn't really Joe.
02:15:06.94 --> 02:15:10.62 You know, you joke about something, but you kind of mean it.
02:15:10.62 --> 02:15:11.62 Yeah.
02:15:11.62 --> 02:15:12.62 I feel real lucky, man.
02:15:12.62 --> 02:15:15.46 Real lucky, because my knee was straight up.
02:15:15.46 --> 02:15:16.46 Oh, yeah.
02:15:16.46 --> 02:15:17.46 Endered.
02:15:17.46 --> 02:15:20.82 And it's not healed yet, but dang, if it hasn't progressed a lot.
02:15:20.82 --> 02:15:21.82 Yeah.
02:15:21.82 --> 02:15:22.82 Yeah.
02:15:22.82 --> 02:15:27.06 And it's not like, you know, when you're like 18 years old, maybe a lighter weight
02:15:27.06 --> 02:15:30.18 person or something, it's like you tend to sort of heal faster.
02:15:30.18 --> 02:15:31.18 Yeah.
02:15:31.18 --> 02:15:33.18 But it's face that you're, you know, your old school.
02:15:33.18 --> 02:15:34.18 And you're not.
02:15:34.18 --> 02:15:36.18 Very small school or maybe not.
02:15:36.18 --> 02:15:37.18 Oh, they're good.
02:15:37.18 --> 02:15:38.58 Your old school, right?
02:15:38.58 --> 02:15:41.74 And, you know, what are you walking around at 230 to 35?
02:15:41.74 --> 02:15:45.10 I mean, I'm just saying that's not an easy racket for the knee.
02:15:45.10 --> 02:15:46.10 So all the time.
02:15:46.10 --> 02:15:47.10 Yeah.
02:15:47.10 --> 02:15:49.06 Meanwhile, you're just boom, boom, boom, bouncing back that fast.
02:15:49.06 --> 02:15:50.06 That's saying a lot.
02:15:50.06 --> 02:15:51.06 Yeah.

02:15:54.94 --> 02:16:00.98 Also the discipline and discipline go ahead of scenario the other day.
02:16:00.98 --> 02:16:02.82 That's actually yesterday.
02:16:02.82 --> 02:16:03.82 Sure.
02:16:03.82 --> 02:16:04.82 Crazy flight situation.
02:16:04.82 --> 02:16:10.26 Understandably rerouting, landing buses, trains is ridiculous.
02:16:10.26 --> 02:16:14.42 Anyways, I'm going into an interview on two hours of sleep.
02:16:14.42 --> 02:16:15.42 Oh, dang.
02:16:15.42 --> 02:16:16.42 Yeah.
02:16:16.42 --> 02:16:18.90 And this is just after, you know, Peter at T.
02:16:18.90 --> 02:16:27.38 is telling me about all the horrible, like cognitive problems that are going to
02:16:27.38 --> 02:16:28.38 give you cause.
02:16:28.38 --> 02:16:34.14 And so yeah, I took, I took like two discipline go.
02:16:34.14 --> 02:16:39.02 When I woke up, I got the interview and then I got there and I did a little bit of, you
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:40.42 know, playing around, or not playing around.
02:16:40.42 --> 02:16:44.10 But they were like prepping for the interview and then I took like three more.
02:16:44.10 --> 02:16:48.36 So I took five discipline go, rocked it.
02:16:48.36 --> 02:16:49.62 I went to those like, I got what?
02:16:49.62 --> 02:16:50.62 You got a question.
02:16:50.62 --> 02:16:52.90 Let me tell you, I think we can get some more.
02:16:52.90 --> 02:16:58.78 So anyways, try that discipline go out if you need something to focus your cognitive.
02:16:58.78 --> 02:17:05.78 So you can get some of that or you can get the discipline go.
02:17:05.78 --> 02:17:08.70 You need the discipline powder.
02:17:08.70 --> 02:17:10.94 Should we just call that Prejujitsu powder?
02:17:10.94 --> 02:17:13.50 Yeah, that's it's starting itself out to me.
02:17:13.50 --> 02:17:17.26 Yeah, it kind of turns like something where you are going to jitsu.
02:17:17.26 --> 02:17:21.14 You're going to need cognitive skills and you know, you're going to need some physical
02:17:21.14 --> 02:17:26.94 skills or some physical enhancements.
02:17:26.94 --> 02:17:27.94 Sure.
02:17:27.94 --> 02:17:29.94 I'm going to call the couple scoops of discipline.
02:17:29.94 --> 02:17:30.94 Maybe three.
02:17:30.94 --> 02:17:31.94 If you need to.
02:17:31.94 --> 02:17:32.94 If you want to get nuts.
02:17:32.94 --> 02:17:33.94 Yeah, that's a good one.
02:17:33.94 --> 02:17:34.94 That's part of my everyday now.
02:17:34.94 --> 02:17:36.94 I'm pulling the Dave Burke everyday.
02:17:36.94 --> 02:17:41.10 Yeah, that's I was, look, there's one thing that's good about it.
02:17:41.10 --> 02:17:43.74 It doesn't have some crazy amount of caffeine in it.
02:17:43.74 --> 02:17:45.94 You don't want to be all I am up on caffeine.
02:17:45.94 --> 02:17:47.94 When you take something, because it's tough to make me feel really good.
02:17:47.94 --> 02:17:51.22 Well, you just took a big hit at caffeine and you're going to get what's that word.
02:17:51.22 --> 02:17:53.94 You're going to get a tolerance to it and then it's not going to have to be effected.
02:17:53.94 --> 02:17:57.54 Discipline has like 15 milligrams of caffeine at per scoop. That's not that much.
02:17:57.54 --> 02:18:00.54 So what do you feel like the.
02:18:00.54 --> 02:18:02.90 You're not really feeling you're feeling the other.
02:18:02.90 --> 02:18:04.54 Yeah, ingredients in there.
02:18:04.54 --> 02:18:09.38 So don't don't fool yourself and get all amped up on caffeine.
02:18:09.38 --> 02:18:12.94 You know, or otherwise you might as well go do meth or cocaine.
02:18:12.94 --> 02:18:14.94 Or just getting some coffee with you.
02:18:14.94 --> 02:18:17.94 You know, you know, you know, that's kind of off the.
02:18:17.94 --> 02:18:18.94 No, I'm just kidding.
02:18:18.94 --> 02:18:20.94 Children don't do meth or cocaine.
02:18:20.94 --> 02:18:21.94 Don't do drugs.
02:18:21.94 --> 02:18:22.94 Period.
02:18:22.94 --> 02:18:31.94 If you want to do something that gives you sort of a addiction, try some strawberry milk,
02:18:31.94 --> 02:18:33.94 which is now out for adults.
02:18:33.94 --> 02:18:35.94 It is absolutely delicious.
02:18:35.94 --> 02:18:38.94 If you want some extra protein in your body.
02:18:38.94 --> 02:18:41.94 So you can get bigger, stronger, faster.
02:18:43.94 --> 02:18:44.94 Better.
02:18:44.94 --> 02:18:45.94 Yeah, true.
