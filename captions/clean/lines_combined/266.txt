00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel Pondcast number 266 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000 And joining us again tonight is Dave Burke. Good deal, Dave Burke. Good evening, Dave. Good evening.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000 So we've knocked out two chapters of Marine Corps, Dr. Publication 1, TAC 4, which is called Competing.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000 And today we're going to delve into the third chapter. Now we have had expectations in each one of these of doing more than one chapter.
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000 I don't think we're going to make it, especially because three has a lot of good stuff in it.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000 And four is longer. So I don't know if you get halfway through four anyways.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000 So we're going to delve into chapter three. And before we kind of kick that off.
00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:02.000 In the last chapter and throughout the book thus far, the Marines have been calling competition or describing competition as an enduring conditioning.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000 Are you getting a enduring condition? It's enduring. It's always happening. Always.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000 And then when we got done, I think it was with the first chapter and we did an underground podcast. And I talked about that clip from there will be blood.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.000 I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. And I kind of talked about this fact that I related to that.
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000 And that I can be really competitive in a lot of ways. And since competition is an enduring condition, that must mean that I'm always competing with everyone all the time.
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000 And if I'm always in competition, well then when do I get a break, when do I sleep? Well, we're not sleeping. I'm not a lot of obviously.
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000 But how am I not getting burnt out?
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000 I'm always competing. How am I not getting burnt out?
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000 And I was thinking about that because I start to think about people hearing this. And I like to think through how people are going to interpret what I'm saying.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000 And Dave, you and I say it's a lot with just the title of the first book, Extreme Ownership. And people think Extreme Ownership.
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000 But it's mean we need to be extreme about stuff. And we have to write a whole other book, kind of write a whole other book with Dave called the dichotomy of leadership saying, no actually you gotta be balanced. We don't want to be extreme.
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000 So when I think about talking and I'm sitting here saying, I'm competing all the time and we're competing and everything is a competition.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000 And I think if someone's going, okay, well, we're going all the time. And then they're going to get burnt out.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:01.000 And how is it that I'm not getting burnt out? Am I superhuman? No. I'm just another person. So how is it that I'm competing all the time, which I can tell you, I can tell you honestly, I am competing all the time.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:14.000 I'm also telling you I'm not superhuman. How is this happening? I can explain it. The kind of people that get burnt out and fall apart.
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000 The reason that that happens is because they are competing at a tactical level.
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:44.000 That's what's going on. They don't get caught up in bar braels and street fights and duels and arguments. And they want to win every altercation they see occurring anywhere around them. And their ego won't let them rest.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:57.000 And I'm not doing that. I don't care about the bar brawl or the street fight or the argument. I don't care about those things. Don't care about them.
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:09.000 I'm in competition, but I'm not in competition at a tactical level. I'm competing strategically. At least I'm trying to, right? I'm not perfect. I'm trying to compete strategically.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000 Now, do you sometimes have to win tactical battles? Do you sometimes do you have a battle, a tactical battle that you have to win?
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000 Some people will come to me without argument. You know there's some battles that you have to win. You know what's your right.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000 And you know what they call those battles? They call them strategic battles. That's not a tactical battle anymore.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000 If I'm in a strategic battle, I'm going to win that. And the point of saying this is as we talk about competition.
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000 And you hear Dave and me and echo getting all fired up about competition and competing all the time. And I keep saying you're always in competition and everything's competition.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000 As we talk about that, don't get wrapped around a tactical competition.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000 Think strategic. Think strategic all the time.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000 And you know you should get in some tactical scraps sometimes. So you don't lose your edge. I'm going to go ahead and say that.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000 You want to give a little scrap. We're going to go a little sparring session. Go ahead and let's do it.
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000 But I'll tell you what, I'm not going to waste any resources. I'm definitely not going to take any significant damage.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000 Look, I'm going to get a little dinged up. It's okay. But I'm not going to waste resources. Real resources.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000 And here's another thing.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000 If you're competing against me,
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000 I will have you in tactical fights all day long.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000 I will put tactical things out there to distract you and fight you.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000 And I put some minimum amount of resources against your whole deal and make you think you're achieving this big victory. And you're not.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000 I will be watching you take damage. I'll be watching you waste resources. I'll be watching you expand leadership capital while I'm putting money in the bank.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000 I'm putting money in the bank. And I'm going to win. I am going to win.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000 So don't mistake that as we talk through this manual. Don't mistake tactical competition for strategic competition.
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000 And we have been saying you are competing and you should remember that you are competing and you are competing all the time,
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000 but you should be competing strategically.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000 And with that, we can go into the book. What do you got Dave? I'm just over here taking notes.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000 I'm just trying to write down because I'm taking this home and thinking about it.
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000 You can play a say that again.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000 A tactical battle that you need to win isn't a tactical battle. Just thinking even in those terms, if you have to win that battle,
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000 meaning it's necessary.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000 By definition, that's not tactical. It's a strategic thing because if you didn't, if it didn't matter, then it's not strategic.
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000 If it doesn't matter, then who cares?
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000 Just the concept of a tactical battle you need to win isn't tactical.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000 And even on the leadership side, when people ask the question, hey, where do I hold the one? Where do I have to apply resources or expand capital?
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000 And the idea that even in reverse, if it has to be achieved, this is not a tactical thing. This is a strategic thing.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000 And understanding that, again, that's just some of that just for me to think about because
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000 And then you ask yourself, or you see a client, or you see a human being,
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000 treating something as if it's a strategic battle, and they don't think through it.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000 Yeah. They don't see that.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000 I mean, really, what's the deal? What happened? What's the worst case scenario? If you lose that battle?
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000 Well, I'm gonna, they're gonna get the op-a.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000 Whatever thing they've rationalized inside their head, which is dragging them to expand resources, to expand leadership capital,
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000 to make someone do something because they're gonna look bad.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000 Which is just insanity. It's total insanity.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000 There's almost nothing. There's almost nothing that I need to make one of my subordinates do.
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000 There's almost, I can't, I can barely think of anything that I need to make one of my subordinates do.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000 You know what I need to make, one of my subordinates do? I need to make sure that all my subordinates knew how to program their radios before they went out by them,
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000 by, when on an operation in Ramadi because if they got stuck without a radio, not known how to program it, they would die.
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000 So on that, you know what I always use that example?
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000 Because there's, like, one of the few that I can possibly think of.
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000 Yeah. It's one of the few that I can possibly think of where I was like, yeah, you know what, you have to do this.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000 Now, here's why, and it's not like I had to have a big discussion. All I said was, hey guys, if you can't program your radio and you get separated, you're gonna die.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000 Therefore, you're not going out.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000 Did anyone say, well, actually, I don't think it's that big risk. No, everywhere yet, Roger that.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000 There was no, there was no discussion about it. It wasn't like an argument.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000 It was, hey guys, I should have done a better job explaining how easy it is to get separated in an urban environment.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000 And if you get separated in this environment, the people that would be coming to get you, they won't be us. They'll be an army unit or a Marine Corps unit,
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000 and you'll need to know how to put those frequencies into your radio by yourself.
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000 Otherwise, you'll be out there alone, and you'll get captured, and you'll have your head cut off.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000 And it takes, by the way, 15 minutes to learn how to program a radio. Let's get it done. And everyone goes, yeah, Roger that.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000 But there's not too many things that require that, and like I said, even that didn't require.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000 So that didn't even cost me leadership capital.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000 It didn't, it actually, that, that moved, actually didn't cost me leadership capital.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000 Instead, people like me have a man.
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000 I would venture to guess that my leadership capital went up a little bit.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000 Because guys are thinking, mmm, I didn't know anything about that.
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000 And by the way, this guy cares about me, because he doesn't want me to be stuck in the middle of Romadi without being able to communicate.
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000 This guy, the reason this guy wants me to do this is because he cares about me. It has nothing to do with my personal gain.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000 Zero. What do I get out of it? Nothing.
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000 Well, I guess I'm taking care of my guys, but again, what is that? I'm taking care of my guys.
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:58.000 The discrimination between tactical and strategic is a huge area for growth.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:18.000 For us as human beings. And I think echo, this has been your constant theme since we started the podcast of the biggest lesson that you learned was long term versus short term, which is the civilian way of saying strategic long term, tactical short term, and the difference between those two.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000 Yes, sir.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000 And the more you figured that out, the better your life got.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000 Yep. Just like that.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000 How old were you when we started this podcast?
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000 Three.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.000 Eight.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000 Maybe 38.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000 There's people that are listening this podcast right now. Better thinking, I'm 32 man already went.
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000 No, it's already too late.
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000 No.
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000 No.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000 It doesn't matter.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000 I mean, I get messages from people that are 58.
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000 And they say, you know, I'm starting to look this long term.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000 I'm making these adjustments, and here's what I'm going to do.
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000 It's never too late.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000 It's never too late to start thinking strategic.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000 It's the expression about you just to like when's the best time to plan to tree or start you just to do it.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000 Best time to plan to tree either 28 years ago or today.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000 Same deal, man. Same exact exact same deal.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000 Yep.
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000 Check.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000 All right.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000 Chapter three.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 It's a short chapter, but there's a lot in it.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000 Chapter three is called preparing for competition.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000 So, you know, that's going to sound.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000 The most important task for Marines and the Marine Corps is to recognize that we are always competing.
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000 Even choosing to do nothing is a competitive decision.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000 It just happens to be one that surrenders the initiative to our competitors.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000 Yes.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000 When you choose to do nothing, you are surrendering your the initiative to your competitor.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:57.000 Now, I got a throw a caveat in there that there are sometimes where tactical patients, which is the cool way of saying waiting,
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000 is a good thing that there's absolutely times where you want to give things a second to develop.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000 We should say that to young seals.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000 If they were making calls too fast, you hey, let it develop a little bit.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000 You don't even know what's really happening.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000 You've heard four gun shots and you're trying to make a decision on which way to go.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000 No, let's wait till we hear some volume of fire from the enemy.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000 So, we actually have a more relevant and real idea as to where they are.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000 But, I think the number is seven out of ten times.
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000 Maybe eight out of ten times action is better than in action.
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000 So, that's why the Marine Corps says bias for action.
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000 That's why echelon front says default aggressive.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000 It's better to make a move.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000 Eight out of ten times nine out of ten times.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000 It's better to make a move.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000 And if you have an open mind and you're going to read a feedback loop, it almost becomes ten out of ten.
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000 And if you're going to do iterative decision making, meaning I'm going to make a small move really quickly, then it becomes a hundred percent.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000 I'm going to make a really quick move.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000 I'm going to then read the feedback loop and see what I've got.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000 And if you can do that, which is what I do, that's how I cheated.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000 That's how I cheat in decision making.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000 I don't make a big decision.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000 I'm going to make a little one.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000 Make a little tiny decision.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000 Yeah, it does kind of the more you think about it, the more it becomes like, yeah, like a ten out of ten.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000 Especially when you think of it in those terms where, yeah, the photographs of not meaning you're going all out full speed one direction every single time.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000 But that was like, you got to be because it kind of comes from a mindset, right?
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000 Where it obviously default aggressive does.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:59.000 But if taking action versus not taking action, if you just reduce it just to the mindset, like then you can kind of understand like, oh yeah, to not take action is with very few if any exceptions, the wrong thing to do.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000 Yeah, especially when you consider what action, how small an action can be.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000 Yes.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000 And still be action.
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000 Right.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000 Exactly.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000 Yeah.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000 Because like has a hesitation, right?
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000 That's what you don't want.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000 The hesitation.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000 That's like an action.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000 That's like, I'm not making any decision to hold here or anticipate this.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000 I'm not making a decision.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000 I'm just like hesitating kind of thing.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000 Like just not doing that.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000 Yeah, and when you think about like immediate action drills, which you'll have, you know, in a platoon where if we get, if we get,
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000 if we get shot at, here's the immediate action is going to happen without anything.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000 There's action happening with no call being made.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000 No decisions been made, but there's action happening.
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:54.000 Dave, I apologize for not have that I haven't memorized this immediate action that you have in a jet and it's some move that you make when you don't know what else to do, but you just do it.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000 What is it?
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000 Lift, right?
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000 Yes.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000 Lift, vector, on and pull.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000 That's an action.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000 Yep.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000 And that action, you can take that immediately.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000 And then you can figure out what you're going to do.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000 That's right.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000 So it's good to think through those things.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000 It's good if you can just think about, if you can just have an SOP or standard operating procedure that, hey, if this happens, I know I'm at least going to do this.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000 That's a really positive thing.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000 Yeah, I'm rackin' my brain kind of trying to think of a time we're doing nothing and you already said it.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000 I think the thing I was thinking about is even the smallest move, even the smallest decision that to do anything.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000 You interact with the environment, somehow and get some feedback.
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000 You get something.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000 Now that something could be very little and okay cool then I can move a little bit more.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000 But even the smallest move gives you something.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000 So thinking of it in those terms, it's really hard and I'm just thinking of an, an example.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000 We're doing nothing and I can't, I can't think of one.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000 When the alternative is, hey, make a really small move.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000 Just to see what you get in that feedback loop, just to see what kind of return you get on that.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:10.000 And even if the return is like all negative, it's such a small move that the risk of even that 100% negative feedback is like, hey, that's good information.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000 That hasn't toppled us over across us.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000 So even if the response is all bad, the move is so small that's actually good for you.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000 So I just can't pee some and gather we go, no actually, here's the time where I really think doing nothing is right.
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000 When that is the alternative we're thinking about.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Right, right, and when you when you factor in the small iterative decisions, it really eliminates a lot of inaction being good.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000 And neither one of us and none of us are saying that that's never the case.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000 But definitely lean towards the bias for action, definitely lean towards default aggressive.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000 That's where you want to go and then lean with little footsteps.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000 And I think we're where people get hung up on this and we talk about this a lot. The way you describe it.
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000 You're iterative decision making, the way you do it happens so quickly and so rapidly.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000 It appears that you're just going from here all the way to there.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000 So from the outside, it looks like you're making these huge moves.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000 And the reason you say you're cheating is you're going to, I know that's what it looks like.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000 But that's not what's happening.
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000 If you look at it like, hey, you're going from here all the way to there.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000 And you're thinking, I don't know how to do that yet. So I'm going to do nothing.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000 If that's your frame of reference, I understand why doing nothing is, is a reason of alternative.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000 What is, what you don't understand is that you're not doing that.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000 You never go from here all the way to there.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000 You have a thousand little moves along the way, but that happens so quickly.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000 And the maneuvers are so fast that it doesn't appear like that.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000 And if that's all you think is, oh, he just, jocca just goes from here to there.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000 You know, like, that's actually not happening.
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000 Yeah, and what's interesting about what you're saying is,
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000 I don't think anyone thinks I'm going all the way from that here from point A to point F.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000 I don't think they think that I think that they don't even know if we should go to point F or point Z or point Y.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000 And so they're just they haven't made any decision whatsoever.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000 Yeah, meanwhile I go, go to be, that's right.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000 You're not saying go to F.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000 Yeah, I'm saying go to B.
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000 And meanwhile, they don't even know where to go, but then I all of a sudden say, hey, we're going to be right now.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000 I never goes, oh damn, how did you know to go to B?
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000 Because B is only a little training ways away, but everybody thinks that's a big move.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 Because they were trying to calculate, they were trying to try to do that.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000 That's calculus for a giant.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000 And that's what leads to doing nothing.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000 And that's what leads to doing nothing.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000 Because you can't do that calculus.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000 And by the way, what helps you do the calculus?
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000 Well, it helps you do the calculus when you start filling into the variables.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000 What starts filling in the variables is when you start gathering information.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000 And when you start gathering this information, you start filling in those variables.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000 And like you said, even if that variable is negative,
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000 and we go, oh, there's more enemy to the west.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 Okay, cool. Now guess what we know.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000 We're not going west.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000 We can start moving east.
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000 We can start moving south.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000 Whereas if we just sat there, we still don't know where to go.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000 We don't know where to go.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000 We don't know where to go.
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000 East west north south.
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000 We don't know where to go.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000 So that small movement to the east.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000 We're all hey, we just identified more variables.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000 Okay, cool.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000 Now we know not to go there.
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000 So there's the opening sentence.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000 Competition in the Marine Corps.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000 Marines and the Marine Corps are tools for the nation to, by the way.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:28.000 You know, the people talk about like what's the greatest speech that's ever been delivered.
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000 You know, is it Martin Luther King?
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000 Is it Winston Churchill?
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000 Is it Teddy Roosevelt?
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000 You know, we have nothing to fear, but it's which one of those speeches is the greatest speech ever?
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000 And no one's ever asked me this question in a public form where I could answer this question the way I want to answer this question.
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000 But,
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000 Chesty Polar.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000 Give a speech at like some Marine Corps ball gathering.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000 And he was already retired.
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000 He was already Chesty Polar.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000 And, you know, they call him up to give the speech that he's going to give.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000 And the freaking place goes completely nuts, obviously.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000 And he gets up there.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000 And he delivers what I believe to be.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000 At least a strong contender, at least for me, the greatest speech of all time.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000 And he already says.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000 He just says,
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000 Marines.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000 And that's it.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000 The place went freaking nuts.
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000 And he walked off the stage.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000 So, whenever I see the word Marines, I think of that.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000 That's all he needed to say.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:56.000 So, Marines and the Marine Corps are tools for the nation to use in the enduring competition that takes place in international relations.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000 So, what does that mean?
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000 That means every single thing that you do.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000 Every single thing that you do is playing into this competition that you're in in all these different aspects.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000 Every day, Marine capabilities and force posture affect the thinking of our competitors and potential adversaries.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000 Again, this is to propaganda for the Marine Corps.
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000 In case me talking about Chesty Polar saying Marines isn't good enough for propaganda for the Marine Corps.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000 We are credible the Marine Corps. The more attractive we are to allies and partners.
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000 The more credible the Marine Corps is as a deterrent force, the more we affect potential rivals thinking.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000 For Marines, participation in our nation's competitions starts at recruitment.
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000 The quality level of individuals brought into the service provides the raw material to build a credible force.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000 Attributes like education, level physical fitness and mental resilience determine how quickly these individuals
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000 can be transformed into members of a coherent capable organization.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:08.000 These attributes also help establish the range of possibilities available to adapt the existing force or innovate to create a new one.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000 How much do you know about Marine Corps recruiting Dave?
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000 I mean, I have my own personal experience with it. I don't know if I'm an expert on it, but I have a small sense of how it works.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:31.000 The rumor that I've always heard about the Marine Corps is that the Marine Corps spends like a fraction of the amount of money that the Navy, the Army and the Air Force spend on recruiting.
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000 Do you know anything about that?
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000 I can't give you any facts on that. That wouldn't surprise me, but I couldn't prove that.
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:47.000 Yeah, that's what I've always heard. I believe between now I know that they must spend some money because they have advertisements and they have, you know, commercials and stuff like that.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000 But then they do a good job based on narrative alone.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:04.000 I mean, my recollection of when I was really getting into thinking about the Marine Corps was the way that one of the ways I was convinced is it made it sound like it was probably impossible.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000 Like they were recruiting like, you're probably not good enough.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000 Yeah.
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000 But if you are, this is where you should be and there's this sense of like, oh man.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000 Now Dakota Myers almost the exact same story. You know, he showed up and I forget what kind of crazy. He was talking about he had some crazy like haircut, whatever.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000 He was a punk ass kid and he shows up and says, I want to be in the Marine Corps and they said, you don't really look like your Marine Corps material.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000 Yeah.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000 Now, do you think this is when you go to recruiting school?
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000 Are they teaching you that as a recruiter?
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000 I'm pretty sure that's a technique that they leverage.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000 Now, what's interesting is J.P. to now same thing walked into the Navy recruiter.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000 I want to be a Navy seat or I should probably like, I want to be a Navy seat.
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000 Because he's 14 years old, wherever he was.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000 And they said, eh, the wannabe's need to come in on Thursday.
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000 What do you want to be?
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:05.000 And he was determined to just approve that freaking recruiter in Sacramento, California, that J.P. had what it took.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000 It's a great screening tool because I know the Marine Corps wants people that think that they want,
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000 they want people that have big egos in the sense that they think they can do things in their heart.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000 And a great way to test that is, hey, this is too hard for you.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000 And if you go, yeah, you're right.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000 They don't want you anyway.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000 What they want us to go, well, really.
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000 So I would say I'm pretty sure that that is a technique that they proliferate throughout officer and
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000 enlisted recruiting is you're probably not good enough, but we'll see.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:45.000 Now, what percentage of people does that backfire? The humble guy that's a super stud that says, hey, you know, probably, I guess I'm not just, I'm probably not just cut out for it.
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:53.000 And I guess maybe that is a good self selection because now we got to do that maybe at the moment a truth kick, I'm really believe in his capabilities.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000 Very strange.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000 Historically, the Marine Corps has been the nation's hybrid force.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000 Conducting activities that straddle the line between violence and nonviolence.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.000 Marines have often deployed two places to help the local people in time of need while being ready to restore order in those same places if required.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:26.000 The direction for the Marine Corps to be the most ready when the nation is least ready applies as much to competition as it does to war.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000 And this is another one of these statements where you think, well, that that's a good idea.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000 Well, that that that right there is a maneuver to the Department of Defense to give us money.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:45.000 You need to allocate money to the Marine Corps because when the nation is least ready, the Marine Corps will be the most ready.
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.000 In fact, this statement can be viewed as a competitive act in the informational element of national power.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000 Next section is called campaigning mindset.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000 Competition is in and I you know, I love the word campaign.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000 Why? Because because that's the opposite of tactical battle.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000 That's the opposite of a hack. It's the opposite of a shortcut.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000 It's an opposite of this easy solution, the sweatless solution as Colonel David Hackworth once said.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000 It's a campaign. Campaigns don't happen overnight.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:38.000 Competition is enduring in nature at the national level and the military element normally plays a supporting role, especially on the spectrum of competition short of war.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:48.000 This leads us to develop a campaigning mindset about competition, which is characterized by long term thinking and recognition that we need to integrate our actions with others.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:59.000 The Marines compete as part of a naval and joint force, but also as part of the interagency in an approach that combines all the elements of national power.
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000 Now it's sentences like this where I think this this document is not aimed at a landscorpor.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000 This document is aimed at the DOD. This is a campaign. This document is a campaign.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000 It's correct.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000 But this document is a campaign to make sure that we keep the Marine Corps strong.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000 Marines should strive to integrate our allies and partners into our competitions as this will increase our options,
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000 while also increasing the potential number of dilemmas we can present to our rivals.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000 What are we going to get to this?
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000 I don't know if it's in this chapter or one of the later chapters when we start talking about.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000 One of my favorite military terms that combined arm dilemma.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000 But when you think about what you're doing is creating dilemmas for your rivals,
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000 even in not necessarily in a wartime scenario, but even in a competitive scenario,
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000 or a threshold less than violence you're trying to create dilemmas for them.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000 It's a powerful thing.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:12.000 The cultivation of humility is also important for this mindset.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:25.000 Marine's learned early on about the observed orient-decide act loop or utaloop.
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:34.000 Understanding of Uda teaches us that it's important to learn how to learn how to learn.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:50.000 About the observed orient-decide act loop or utaloop. Understanding of Uda teaches us that each decision is a hypothesis that gets tested in the real world when we act.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:06.000 I'm talking to clients and I'm talking to clients as COVID kicked off. I had this little speel that I was giving them.
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000 Basically what I was saying is, hey, if you're in a leadership position and you're not sure what to do, what you got to do in that situation, you got to guess.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000 I've got to go off about, guess I'd say, listen, everybody, no one wants to hear the word guess.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000 Hey Dave, you're in charge. What do you want me to do? Let me take a guess. No one wants to hear that. That sounds horrible.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.000 Who wants to follow somebody that I guess we should have you ever heard a leader in your life that was inspiring with confidence when they said, hey, I'm guessing we should go over there.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000 You don't say that as a leader. You don't use those words.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:46.000 And yet, and then I've followed up and say, but when you're in a leadership position, when you are making a decision, what you're calling a decision, it is a guess.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.000 And what the Marine Corps did here, because they didn't want to use the word guess, they sent us up into the next level and just called it a hypothesis.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:10.000 Which is a guess, which is an educated guess, which is still a guess. But the amount of times that you are in a leadership position where you know for certain what's going to happen next is 0.001% because we can't predict the future.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000 We don't know what all these little variables are, how all these little variables are going to turn out.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000 So that's what we're doing as leaders is we're making guesses. We're making hypotheses. We're taking what you say educated guesses.
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000 That's like in between, right? A guess is just a guess. An educated guess next level hypothesis.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000 Yes, sir.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000 So we've got to understand that. We understand that that decision is a hypothesis that gets tested in the real world when we actually act.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000 The campaigning mindset then includes the understanding that we base our plans on a model we created of our competitor.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000 Okay? Our decisions about how to achieve our goals and competition are theories.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000 Their guesses.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000 Why do guess work going on?
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:09.000 And what's good, what I like about using the word guess, what I like about that is I think, you know, Dave, you were talking earlier about hesitation if you're making an indiscision making process.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000 Well, if I'm a young leader and I'm looking at my options A, B, or C.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000 And I'm not sure which one to do.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000 I might be thinking in my mind, well, what am I supposed to do? Just guess.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000 I suppose to just take an educated guess with what we should do right now. I got all these resources. I got maybe lives at stake or I got a capital to take.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000 I got all these things going on. I don't feel comfortable just guessing. So I'm just going to sit here.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000 And wait, because I'm scared, because I, I doesn't seem right that I should be guessing what to do. Yes, you should.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:50.000 Now, what I recommend you do is you guess little. Just take a little guess. Hey, should I go and door A, B, or C?
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000 You know what I'm going to do immediately? Hey, I'm going to walk up that door and take a listen. What are I here in there?
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000 Right? Is there a party going on? Or is there gunfire?
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000 So, or is there no noise? Now, no noise on a little scared about, but if I hear music, that's kind of a positive sign.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000 But I didn't enter the door. All I did was put my ear up to it.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000 So that's what you do. You make a little guess. I guess we should check out that door. I hear gunfire.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.000 That doesn't sound like a good door. What about the next door? I hear nothing. Not sure about that one. What about this door over here? I hear music.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:34.000 I hear music that echo Charles plays in his vehicle from the islands, which means everyone in that room is kind of cruising.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000 And I'm feeling pretty good about it. We're opening that door. No factor.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000 So, if you're not comfortable taking a guess, then it's hard to make a decision.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000 Our plans then need to have feedback loops built into them to either confirm that our models and theories are correct.
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000 Enough to help us reach our goals or that we need to modify them.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000 And by the way, they don't bring this back up to humility they should.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000 Because if you're not humble and you think I'm guessing door C and you walk up to it, you hear gunshot you like, well, I guess C we're going in.
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000 Bad idea. So it takes humility to modify your plan. And if you're not humble, you won't be modifying your plan. You'll be sticking with your plan until it kills you.
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:30.000 Competition campaigning introduces the idea of persistence. Strategic competition is more like a marathon than a sprint.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:37.000 Competition's enduring nature means that 80 campaign will require long-term commitment to achieve its goals.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000 We also need to be alert for how our competitive advantages and those of our rivals will shift over time.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:57.000 This is what's scary about wars like Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, where your enemy is home.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000 They're not on deployment. They're going to be there. And when the wars, they'll be there for 100 years.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:15.000 There's not an American that wants to be there. There's not an American that's, hey, I'm stoked. I'm in Al-Kain.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.000 Hey, I'm stoked. I mean, cut. Hey, I'm stoked. Wherever. They want to be back in Nebraska.
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000 They want to be back in Iowa. But the people that are we're fighting against, they are home.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000 So before you get into that combat, you got to figure out who's got the home field advantage.
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000 It's a big deal. It's a way bigger deal than it is in sports.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000 This next section is professionalism.
00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:03.000 As military professionals charged with the defense of the nation, marine leaders must be true experts in the conduct of war.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:15.000 This statement from war fighting, the MCDP1 war fighting establishes the first priority for Marines, which is the definition.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:27.000 The professionals, Marines recognize this defense as a vital and enduring national interest. Our professionalism is grounded in our nation's values, which sets us apart from our, from competitors.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000 Achieving that standard, being prepared to defend the nation has been and will continue to be a competitive act.
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000 So us just being ready is, is, is how we are helping America compete with everybody else in the world because they got to keep up. You see what the Marine Corps is doing?
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000 You know you better be training hard.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000 We accept that the existence of the Marine Corps helps to turn potential foes.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000 Our goal is for that deterrence to take place below the violence threshold.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:13.000 So what we're doing right there, we're kind of making sure that even the doves in the government are looking at the Marine Corps thinking, you know, the Marine Corps doesn't want war either.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000 The Marine Corps wants peace. They want to they want these things to happen below that we better give them more money.
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:30.000 Well funded Marine Corps professionals understand this goal and thus direct their energies, self-study and unit development in particular toward achieving it.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000 So all Marines are trying to become professionals.
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000 Professionals.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000 True experts in the conduct of war.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000 As professionals, we recognize that development of coercive tools must be balanced with the need to attract in competition as well.
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000 For example, one component of the Attraction Strategy could lead to greater deterrence through building increased interoperability with an ally.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000 It could also lead to advances through the informal element of national power as we perform disaster relief mission.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000 Marines must remain alert for the opportunities to use and integrate both coercion and attraction into the larger competition.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000 So the Marine Corps is not they're saying here we're not just here to fight wars.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000 We're here to build relationships. Now at echelon front, we talk about building relationships all the time.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000 That's how you lead. You lead by building relationships. That's how you get things done by building relationships.
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000 And what we're talking about here is we are competing.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000 And in order to compete, guess what we do.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000 We build relationships.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000 And just to get people example.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000 And I'm sure you have some more Dave, but especially before the war started for me in the 90s.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 This is what the seal teams did.
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000 Go to a country train their special operations unit.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000 Do a big exercise.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000 Train them in the use of our weapons.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000 We train in the use of their weapons.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000 We send some people to learn how to speak their language.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000 We bring some people to learn that they can learn how to speak English.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000 We form these relationships. We work together.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000 So that way we're strengthening our allies.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000 We have somebody we can rely upon.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000 We get to know them.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000 That's just relationships. That's what it is.
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000 Did you guys do that in the pilot world?
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000 Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about carrier deployments.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000 And I think right now there's a connotation that the aircraft carrier.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000 And it's by already always existed.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000 But certainly now since post 911,
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000 the carriers, this power projection tool, this 90,000 tons of diplomacy,
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000 sovereign US soil all over the way.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000 They have these great taglines.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000 The navy leverages which are true in a lot of ways.
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000 But pre 911, if you ever did a cruise, pre 911,
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000 like I did back in the day, the joke,
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000 we called them pleasure cruises.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000 It was like 13, 14 port calls.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000 And the two months that you sailed from San Diego to the Persian Gulf,
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000 was a bunch of port calls.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000 You're doing joint operations with different countries.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000 You're pulling up here,
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000 side and contributing to their economy.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000 You're building all those relationships.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000 And most of it is allies or people we want to build relationships with.
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000 And you go to the Gulf for a couple months.
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000 Do that thing.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000 And in that, you're doing three or four port calls to barrain.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000 The UAE, all these places where we're trying to strengthen relationships.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000 And that that carrier was an instrument of power projection.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000 It was an instrument of diplomacy,
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000 which was building those relationships.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000 Obviously, post 911, my experience, my second cruise,
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000 was like go to the North Arabian Gulf,
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000 stay there for seven months.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000 Come home.
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000 But before that, the investment that Navy was making
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000 was mostly strengthening the relationships.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000 And there are stories out there, even somewhat recently,
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000 that carriers would deploy for disaster relief with no aircraft on them,
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000 just to send a carrier to help floods and crazy things that happen
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000 in different places,
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000 strictly for strengthening ties and relationships
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000 that are projecting literal no combat power.
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000 By design because the Navy see,
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000 well, I'm sure it's larger than just the Navy,
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000 but that's my connection.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000 And I'd deploy it off carriers for the most part.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000 So that's attraction.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000 That's attraction as opposed to the chance.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000 We're just trying to show people,
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000 hey, you want to be friends with us.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000 We're attractive.
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000 We can help you if you get no time to need.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000 We're a good ally at a tactical level
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000 when I would deploy in the 90s.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000 Perk and a curve.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000 We would go out and do exercises
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000 where I would be in the jungle.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000 With some special operations unit from some other country.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000 What do you do when you are a fighter pilot?
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000 Same thing.
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000 Are you giving them a tour?
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000 Are you taking them in the backseat?
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000 Like, at a tactical level,
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000 just out of my own curiosity.
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000 What would you do?
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000 You're flying with them.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000 You're spending time with them.
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000 And there's a little bit of a way.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000 Are they flying their aircraft?
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000 And so you're there, you're wingman,
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000 and you work with them.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000 Yeah, you're integrating with them.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Sometimes you fight against them.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000 Sometimes you fight with them.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000 Really what it's supposed to be is because you ever put your ego in check
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000 and let one of these,
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000 let one of these foreigners beat you in a dogfight.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000 Zero percent chance.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000 Zero.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000 Now, certain countries,
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000 they would have,
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000 we would fly with different countries that they would have different
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000 ROE, different rules, training rules and things like that.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000 And you could see some of them were geared very specifically
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000 to make sure that certain people had advantages.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000 And we would play by those rules and sometimes get in trouble
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000 for not following those rules.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000 You know, one of the things that's really cool about the American military,
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000 and certainly in aviation.
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000 And there's a saying we have,
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000 I think there's no rank in the cockpit.
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000 So I could be the junior doing the squadron.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000 I'm not saying this happened very often,
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000 but you could be a middle-level guy.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000 You're going to go out, fly with your boss.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000 And once you start fighting him,
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000 like you can pummel him to just pummel him into the ground.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000 And it's, there is no like,
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000 death-friends like, I don't want to make the old man look bad.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000 You go out there and do your thing.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000 That's not always like that.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000 But the interaction, in some sense,
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000 was this idea that this American military with this big,
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000 this big power aviation world is something they can learn from.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000 But we always learned stuff from them too.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000 We would share briefing techniques and how they ran their briefs,
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000 how they trained their guys,
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000 how they did certain things.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000 And a lot of it,
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000 at least on paper, was for us to bring to them,
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000 things that could help them get better.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000 But it was always reciprocal.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000 We always learned from operating with other countries.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000 And I flew with pilots and airplanes from all sorts of different countries.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000 Even sometimes the same exact airplane,
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000 but they fly at differently.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 They do things differently.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000 So there's a whole bunch of things that you can do to interact with them.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000 That is beneficial for both.
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000 It was probably the opposite.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000 What we knew and how we did it was using more,
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000 more beneficial to them,
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000 but it wasn't completely one side at either.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000 Find dissimilar with different countries is a blast,
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000 because you learned stuff to go, oh man,
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000 we don't do that in our airplanes.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000 That's really good for me to see.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000 I think it would be more prepared for if something actually really happens.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000 Would you guys go toe to toe, top gone,
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000 dog fight style, one on one?
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000 Yeah, you'd have different things.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000 I have never been in a situation where if the brief was you and me
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000 are going to fight, I don't care,
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000 what country or what plan once fights on,
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000 it is game on.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000 There is no like, hey, go easy on this guy or lift this guy.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000 I have never been in a dog fight once in my life.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000 Other than, hey, I'm, they're going to show you certain things.
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000 But if it's like a real dog fight,
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000 like just a real fight, you're just, you fight your best airplane.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.000 There are times that you would dial back your best jet because it'd be really,
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000 it would undermine the effectiveness of the training of the relationship
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000 of the big as well.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000 But it never, like, oh, you did,
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000 we're eating, never good job.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000 You really caught me off guard there.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000 You got me.
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000 That would be, you know, in the heyday of can you when you're a top
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000 guy and I pee and you're fighting against somebody else.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000 And you're going to come back, no joke.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000 You come back with 25 30 valid shots.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000 That can be really disheartening for somebody who look on paper and go,
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000 hey, let me see your shot card and they've got zero shots.
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000 And you're like, oh, hang on, I need to get my second sheet of paper.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000 And if there's a top guy and I pee or a web school IP listeners,
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000 they're laughing right?
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000 You can come back with in four or five sets, five six shots per and you have 30 valid shots.
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000 And the other guy's got zero.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000 If you do that set after set after set after set after set after a while,
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000 it'd be like you and me rolling on the mats and you doing nothing but trying to beat me.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000 You're not teaching me and not training me.
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000 You're just going to beat me and like, bro, what would?
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000 I don't want to do this anymore.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000 So you would dial that back.
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000 But you never be like, oh, Dave, that was amazing.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000 How you did that.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000 I didn't think you could, you would never get to that level of that in an actual fight.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000 When we're training and doing other things, yeah, you're there to learn and they learn from you
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000 and they learn from them.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000 But I've never been in a one-one V-one where I'm dialing it back because somebody needs somebody saying,
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000 hey, don't fight your best gen.
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000 I'm only doing that in a tactical sense of helping him see sight pictures and maneuvering in a way that's benefiting him.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000 But not like, because I feel bad or something like that.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000 Are the personalities of the foreign countries, fighter pilots similar to Americans?
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000 Yeah, one of the things, I'd be interested in what you saw with special forces around the world.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000 What I came to find is, despite what appears to be a whole bunch of differences between different countries when it came down to it,
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000 the personality of fighter pilots are really similar.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000 There are differences.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000 There are some cultural things, there are some organizational things.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:30.000 But at the end of the day, fighter pilots that fight fighters in any country and every type of fighter, they're much more similar than they are different.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000 Yeah, same thing with special operations.
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000 There's definitely some differences in culture and whatnot.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000 It's a pretty thin layer that you have to pull back and all of a sudden.
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000 Oh, these guys are kind of just like us.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000 The mentality of the totally.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000 From a maintenance perspective.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000 It seems like just the American sort of, from manufacturing to maintenance,
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000 the maintenance programs and the Navy, even in the SEAL teams, we would especially.
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:13.000 Before the once the war started, we kind of we saw less of the Navy kind of administrative stuff on our inside the terms.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.000 But when the 90s it was like, hey, you got to do these protocols that the big Navy follows and so you'd see, oh, well, you know, these guys are square to weather.
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:33.000 The Navy is square to wait. There's a reason that when you when you pull a piece of firefighting gear off of a wall on a ship that's been there for three years.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000 It works. It works because it's gone through this maintenance check. It's gone through every 30 days and every 90 days.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:45.000 It's gotten this and it's got this and the other thing is, are there are, do foreign countries have that same level of.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000 Being square to away from a maintenance perspective.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000 You know, I don't know if I ever got to that level that layer of fidelity.
00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:05.000 I will say that the American military, certainly the Navy and the Marine Corps, I get most of my experience with, that is something we take really, really seriously.
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.000 And what you just described is the equipment that we have, the things we have as old as they are, whatever, the things we have work.
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:23.000 And that when I'm manned up an aircraft, I never once got an airplane and felt like kind of sketchy about it. Never once did I get an airplane and not feel like I'm getting an airplane.
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:36.000 And I'm not sure if that's true for other countries or other other services outside of America, but I always, and I've flown with the Navy a lot, I've owned the Marine Corps a lot, I've owned the Air Force a lot, and that is universal.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.000 So I have a different feeling and I have gotten into aircraft and been completely sketched out with both my fingers crossed, hoping that this thing is going to make it.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000 And in all those cases, it was an aircraft that was not an American military aircraft in your country.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000 Well, I guess this is good go down like that, this could be it.
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000 I never had the best feeling.
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000 And what's weird is, you know, the other thing about the American military aircraft is not working, man.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000 Like the Navy helicopters, they're just, they're daily drivers.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:17.000 They're daily driver, a CH-46, a Navy CH-46, that thing is a daily driver.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000 That thing is a Ford F-150, that's just ready.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000 You have to think it's going to do its job.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:32.000 So I always felt, even though there'd be hydraulic fluid all over the deck and it would be a little bit, it would look sketchy.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000 But you know that that thing's been flying.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000 Well, first of all, how old is CH-46 platform?
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000 19 early 1960s.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000 And some of those birds are from the 1960s.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000 Still flying.
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000 Well, at least they were still flying when I was in.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000 Yeah.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000 All right, little tangent right there.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000 And what's interesting is everything we just talked about.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000 All plays, that's what this whole book is about. It's about competition.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000 But it's all those things that's the reason I was kind of diving into it.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000 It's all these things are how we are competing with our allies and with our rivals.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000 And we're letting everybody know that this is what we've got.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000 And these are capabilities and this is what we can do.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000 Like that's all part of the game.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000 Yeah.
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000 And I was thinking that that tangent was also like, that's what makes us professionals.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000 That's the profession of what we're doing.
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000 It's not a hobby.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000 As fun as it is, it's flying airplanes, all those are professional things.
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000 And that's when we're working with other countries.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000 The one thing I will say this is that I know when you're going to fight someone
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000 outside of your squadron.
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000 So another squadron.
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000 And then outside of the service, like we're going to go with the air force.
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000 You had the sense of like, you're going to be on your A game.
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000 When we were fighting with other countries, it was like, you,
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000 you were going to show them your absolute best game in everything we do
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000 from brief to shut down and everything in between.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000 So there was a sense of looking the part and that every step away from your squadron
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000 from your bros that went up higher.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000 Like don't you go fight with the air force and embarrass us?
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000 And when you're fighting with foreign countries,
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000 the need to look professional was absolutely understood.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000 Verbalized at all or no?
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000 Absolutely.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000 Absolutely.
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000 Check.
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000 Who would you train with?
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000 Like for example, like what other country?
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.000 I mean, okay, so I have trained personally with Canadians, Australians,
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:36.000 Brits, Saudis, Emirates, Kuwaitis, Singapore, Malaysia.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000 I'm running out there's more.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000 These are all just interfaces or services.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000 Your country that fly different airplanes or interacted in some way.
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000 Japan, a whole bunch of countries.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000 Do you ever fly their planes?
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000 So every, you said something.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000 I'm kind of laughing at it and I didn't know we're going to circle back to it.
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000 Every single time you go to this kind of the last day or two, you have some graduation
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000 thing and they're always offering, hey, you jump in there.
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000 And remember, I flew single-seater planes.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000 So it wasn't always that we could do that.
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000 But if there's a two-seat jet or something, we always offering.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000 And they're always offering us, hey, jump in the back seat.
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000 I never once, never once.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000 I don't want to be in the back seat.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000 First of all, of anything.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000 Certainly not a former Soviet Union,
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000 but in the middle of the day,
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000 I never got in the back seat of somebody else's airplane.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000 You were busy.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Couldn't do it that day.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000 Not available.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000 And that I think is what you're saying.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000 I don't know anything about anything.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000 I don't know anything about this airplane.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.000 Yeah.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000 First of all, I don't want anything to be the back seat.
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000 I don't know if the cool, and guys would kill for that stuff.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000 And I never wanted to do it.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000 Being a back of a flanker or a maid or something.
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000 Go for a good.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000 That's all you.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000 Yeah.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000 Sometimes you'd have the same planes, don't we?
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000 Yeah.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000 Yeah.
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000 Canadians, Australians, we play the exact same airplanes.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000 It's the like in the sealed teams.
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000 If you're going to do something, you're in some foreign aircraft.
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000 The only way to get out of it would be to basically quit.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000 You know, you can't say, well, hey, guys,
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000 I'm not really comfortable with this aircraft.
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000 And so you're sitting there in a squad.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000 And every single one of those,
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.000 there's probably like there's everything one of those guys is thinking, we should not be doing this.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000 And every single one of those guys doesn't say,
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000 I've worked about it, gets on that bird, and goes and does what you got to do.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000 Not me.
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:28.000 Back to the book, Warfighting also instructs that the quote,
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000 Military Profession is a thinking profession.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000 End quote.
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000 This means that Marines must practice mental,
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000 the mental discipline necessary to challenge our assumptions.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000 As professionals, we need to disproportionately assess the environment and make certain we are setting the pace for our competitors.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000 I was on with a client the other day.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000 And well, you know, the lead into the question that I got asked was, well, you know, in the military, of course,
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000 it's a, it's a very hierarchy structure thing.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000 And what you want is people at all think the same way.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000 You know, that was the lead into the question.
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000 So any ask the question, then I had to start with,
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000 let me just tell you that the last thing I want on my team is a bunch of people that think the same way I do.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000 Actually, I want a bunch of people that push back and think different thoughts and see different perspectives than me.
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000 And so here's the Marine Corps, quoting from their, their manual number one,
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000 which is called Warfighting Military Profession is a thinking profession.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000 And it takes discipline to challenge our own assumptions.
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.000 Again, it's totally, the complete opposite of what everyone thinks the Marine Corps is.
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000 Everybody thinks everyone want the old. We want every Marine to think the same. No, you don't.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000 We want them to actually, it's actually we're being instructed to challenge our own assumptions.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000 Yeah, I like that connection to you were talking earlier about wanting to see this thing connect back to humility,
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000 which was that sentence kind of started this.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000 And that there is, there is an undeniable connection there.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:02.000 The mental discipline necessarily challenged our own assumptions. The humility that it takes to go and look at your own,
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000 guess your own assumption to go, I might be wrong.
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000 The humility inside of that and they're calling it mental discipline,
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000 but those two are completely linked.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000 And even if you just think about the things you say, the self discipline it takes for you to do the things that you do is discipline as you are.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000 The reason you do it is that you don't want to get complacent.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000 You don't want to get comfortable. You don't want to get weak. So you have the mental discipline to do that.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000 And that is humility.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000 Because if you don't, I can skip a day.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000 I just skip a couple days, whatever.
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.000 Either a lack of mental discipline or a lack of humility will lead you to not challenge your assumptions and just think that everything is going fine.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000 And we'll just go through with it.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000 My plan's good to go.
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Yeah.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000 Next section is education.
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000 But before we go into this next section, let me ask you this.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000 Do you remember when I was talking about diving and not wanting to be the buddy?
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000 Yeah.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000 Totally.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:03.000 So that was, I think when we were talking about it, I was just, you know, the single seat mindset of my experience.
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000 You know, is it a similar thing where if you're in the back seat, you're just kind of not in control and you're not much to do and you're sort of,
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000 Yeah, I mean, that was for me.
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000 And there were guys just like me that had no problem sitting in the back seat.
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:29.000 If, if you lined up like 10 fighter pilots today and like, hey, do you want to go fly in the back seat of an authentic P51 from World War II?
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000 Nine of them would be in there like this and I would say no thanks.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000 So it could even be a hundred or ninety nine of them would say I'll be in there.
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000 Just about every one of you in there, I'm not even a pilot.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:39.000 Yeah.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000 And I understand that the historical significance of it.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:53.000 And I'm not even sure it's rational to even think that, but I never, ever, ever, even even wanting to fly a two-seat airplane.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000 I didn't want to do that because I didn't, I didn't want people looking at me.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000 You know, like, hey, what do you like?
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000 I got this, you know, and that's all young.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.000 I mean, I think I'll grow them out in some ways, but there is an absolute mental, a uniqueness of being alone in an airplane.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000 There is a, there's something about that.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000 There's something unique about that.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000 You know, I got a big smile in my face right now.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000 So there's a, I'm not even a hundred percent sure about this, but I'm ninety nine.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000 This is why this is great.
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Every time you say single seat, every time you're like, well, it's a single seat.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:40.000 There's a, there's a Ferrari sports car, which is one of the,
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000 one of the most expensive Ferrari's that you can get.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000 It's nuts.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000 You know, it's got 10 million horsepower, and it can do the whatever.
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000 And it's a single seat car.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000 And I, we're going to, I'm going to have to fact check this.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.000 The name of the car is ego-east.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000 That's the name.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000 It's like something ego.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000 That's the name of the car.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000 Totally.
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000 I'm in this thing by myself.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000 There's not even anyone else to come in in here.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000 It's not possible.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000 This is all about me.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000 Well, I think of the ego.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000 I mean, if you want to think about even just me, think of the ego of,
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000 um, flying for the military, not good enough.
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000 Flying helicopters, not good enough.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000 Flying cobras, not good enough.
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Flying jets, not good enough.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000 Flying F-18s, not good enough.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000 Flying single seat F-18s.
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000 Okay, that'll do.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000 Like the criteria of what I had created in my mind of what success was.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000 Like what success was was just that.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.000 And, and I don't mean to like presume that I know what you, you know, what you,
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000 you were thinking, but hey, do you want to just be in the Navy?
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000 That's not enough for me.
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000 Uh, you could be a diver, or like, and you could go to the military,
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000 like, and even, and I'm, I'm implying like it's kind of crazy.
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000 Like green berate.
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000 Mmm.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000 That's not what I want to do.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000 Like, juggle.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000 You know, many people would kill to say their green berate, like, yeah, I know I understand it,
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000 but that's not what I want.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000 And I had created a scenario in my mind, like, if it's not a single seat,
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000 I lot F-18 in the Marine Corps, I'm not going to be happy, which is kind of,
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000 it's insane.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.000 It's crazy, but that is, that is what, that's what I wanted to do.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000 And I don't, maybe if I ended up in a two-seat garage in what I've somehow go, hey,
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000 you know what, I was in the Navy.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000 This was, this is totally awesome.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000 This is great.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000 Maybe.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000 But you, you know, the ego, the power of the ego going.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:57.000 And that's, I think, not to defend myself too much, but I think it's a little bit different than arrogance.
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000 The ego and the arrogance, you know, the flaunting of, I'm better than you are against,
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000 and more like, no, that to me is the hardest, that's the highest peak you can get to.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000 That's where I want to be.
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000 And I had created it that, that's what I wanted.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000 And other guys like, they didn't, I don't think I'll fly whatever.
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000 Uh-oh.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000 Really?
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000 Yeah, cool, whatever, I'll fly that.
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000 Cool.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000 So, go fly that.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000 If you don't have that, how far do you make it?
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000 Not where I wanted to go.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000 I mean, okay, so there might be some small tiny, minuscule part of the population that
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000 is just so talented that they can kind of just cruise by and they're going to get it.
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000 Right.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000 Yeah.
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000 There are.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000 And there's some people that are like, guess what I'm doing this weekend.
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000 I'm sharpening my knife and polishing my boots.
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000 Yeah.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000 Because that was me in seal training.
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000 You know, me in seal training was, oh, guys are going to go to whatever, you know,
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000 go to the mall, go try and meet girls or whatever.
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000 I'm going to sharpen my knife the whole weekend and get ready for inspection.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000 Because I want to make sure I get through this thing.
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000 Because I'm not sure, I see pitfalls all over the place and I don't need any more pitfalls than
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000 or are these assistants.
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000 And you're not going to feel like you're missing out either.
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000 You're not like, man, I wish I was at the bar.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000 You're not thinking about it all.
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000 You're like, this is what I should be doing.
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000 This is what I should be doing.
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000 I don't care about anything else.
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000 So you don't even feel like you're doing it even though you don't want to.
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000 You wouldn't want to do anything else.
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000 Matter of fact, if you did the other thing, you're like, you know what I should be doing
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000 right now?
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000 I should be back home prepping.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000 That's what I should be doing.
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000 So the, I think that's the difference.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000 Well, maybe not the difference, but when you talk about, when you talk about ego.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000 And you cross section some humility in there.
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000 Guess what that equals.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000 That equals someone that's working as hard as they possibly can and holding themselves the highest
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000 possible standards so that they can achieve what they want to achieve.
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000 When someone's just arrogant, guess what they don't do that extra studying.
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000 They don't stay in sharpen their knives.
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000 They don't. And look, there's a tiny, minuscule percentage chance that they have the natural
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000 talent. And it's probably, well, it's, I'll tell you it's a lot easier in the see it to get through
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000 basic seal training, just based on the fact that you're really good athlete and you're
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000 decently tough.
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000 And if you have that, you can be pretty arrogant and still make it through because you don't really
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000 need to do anything extra because you can do a role climb and you can carry a log around
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000 and it's like, okay, you know, you played whatever. You did track and field and you played football
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000 and you, you know, you show up and you're 21 years old and you're really good shape.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000 You can be pretty arrogant and not really have to do anything extra and make it through the program.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000 I bet that's a little bit more challenging. There's probably less people that would fall into that category
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000 in pilot school because you get hit with the academics.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000 You get hit with the, the fine motor skills.
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000 You get hit with the, the natural ability to, like I remember when I took the test for officer
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000 candidate school and they're showing you pictures and what is this, is this plain, they're
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000 showing, like, I was even going into aviation or anything. They're showing you a plane.
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000 Is this thing coming or going? Is this that?
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000 And so you're getting hit with those kind of tests as well. So there's got to be, there's,
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000 there's different types of screening that's taking place that are more, there's a,
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000 there's a broader modality of screening as opposed to seal training. It's like,
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:28.000 be cold, do pull ups. That's, that's not a huge, how much autonomy do you have over your schedule
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000 and stuff in, in seal training as well? I'm sure some point you have zero, but do you have a bunch of free time
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000 do you surprisingly, what surprising to a lot of people is you do have a lot.
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000 Yeah, you do have a decent amount of free time and that is part of the test.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000 Yeah, part of the test is, oh, you want to go get drunk and get in a fight. Cool. You're not here anymore.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000 Right. Because you just got in trouble. We don't need you in the seal teams. Oh, you did, you just went and
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000 didn't prepare this weekend and now you're failing your third inspection. Cool. We don't need you in the
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000 seal teams. Like, so there is a, they have to give you some opportunity. They have to give you enough
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000 rope that you can hang yourself and you certainly can. And there's plenty of, plenty of guys that did.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000 Yeah. Plenty of guys that got in trouble in town, didn't come back from Mexico in time for
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000 master and, you know, you hit a couple of those things and you're, you're gone. So they give you enough
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000 rope if you're knucklehead, you'll hang yourself with it. But other than that, if you can do pull ups and you
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000 can suffer, you can do it with some rope climbs, you can kind of just grit through it.
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000 And that's why I think you, that's why I think I would venture to say that we have a higher
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000 percentage of arrogance in the seal teams because you don't, because you're not going to get
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000 humbled quite as much as as you are in such a selective scenario as going to flight
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000 school. Well, going to OCS, going to the basic school, you know, getting down selected,
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000 down selected to get in, down selected at OCS, down selected at the basic school,
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000 down selected at flight school. And then down selected to go to top gone. Like, that's
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000 a bunch of very narrow, very narrow funnels that you got to get through. If you're going to
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000 make it all the way to top gone instructor, we don't, that's a bunch of very narrow things
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000 to pass. Yeah, even with that, it's not a flawless system. I mean, even with that,
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:34.000 there are, there are, there that maybe shouldn't be there. I, I, I equate, and I'm probably
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000 wrong about this. Just my perception, I equate the seals, being in A B seal as, as
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000 even inside the community of these highly, highly capable special operations organizations
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000 through the different services that the seals, I elevate them in my own mind, that
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000 there's just something unique about that. And if I take a step back and I think, like, okay,
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000 flying F-16s with the Air Force or flying F-18s for the Navy, then Marine Corps. Look,
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000 man, it's the same. And there's probably people's like, greenberry and ABC, like, you could
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000 account a couple of that are, that's not what I had in my mind, that there was a piece
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000 that would just set up a tiny bit compared to everything else. That's what I think,
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000 when I think from the outside of seals, or at least can understand someone in your
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000 shoes going, that one. And I would say when I was 18 and I was raising my right hand to
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000 and listening to the Navy, that's what I was thinking. Once I was in and I worked with the,
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000 I worked with the Marine Corps, I worked with your Army Special Forces, I worked with the
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000 totally soldiers from the hundred and first airborne. I realized there's guys here that are
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000 ten times better than me. And there and there and there and a ground pounder in an infantry unit.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000 Yeah, good. I am a humble person. I was going to ask you, so what, once you make it through
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000 Wicked after Wicked after, after Nera Wicked after Nera Wicked after Nera Wicked and now you're
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000 to point where you're a top gun senior instructor and there's no person that can beat
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:05.000 you in a dogfight. How are you finding your humility at that point? For me, it was that
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000 there actually still were people that could beat me. Got it. And I think it was almost
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:20.000 luck that I was able to keep being reminded of that. And what I mean by that is, no one,
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000 I will never, even if you could track it, I will never be considered the best. Even
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000 the guys at my top end of my generation, I'm in a conversation of a couple of guys, but
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000 nobody's going to go, oh, they broke was the best guy. Nobody's going to say that I,
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000 I simply was not. Now, I was good enough to be in a strad of a couple people that
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000 we had a small pool of of instructors that sort of fit in that little category. And I was in there.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000 But no question that I was not at the top is there a singular person that was, or is it to,
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000 no, it's, it's usually not, and it's, in my experience, it was like, there's a little
01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000 group, but inside that every now and then, those guys get to fight each other. And what
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000 almost always happened is it's, at the end, it's neutral. You come back and it was awesome,
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000 but nobody got really the upper hand. Every now and then go, oh, dude, he was pushing me around
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000 a little bit. So he, but it's never like he shot me or he was pushing, he bullying me.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000 He was like, you had like 10 degrees on me there at the end of that 20 minute fight.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000 So it was really super. I went out towards the later half of my career.
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000 I was the, I was the senior instructor at talk and I was the training officer as a marine.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000 So you're talking wicked after wicked, I went out and flew with a guy named Tim Downing,
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000 legendary Navy pilot, CEO of Top Gun, my boss at the time. And he went out.
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000 And we did four fights. First three were just how you play out neutral, neutral, neutral.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000 I was paying really close attention. I got to the last fight and I, I did the first turn.
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000 I go, I'm going to get him. I got him. I figured him out.
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000 And it was going to be a really satisfying moment for me.
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000 And he ended up doing something. I didn't think it even be done in there.
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000 And he, he completely pummeled me. And to the point that I'm looking over from my shoulder,
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000 almost like a brand new guy don't know what, what is happening.
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000 How did this happen to me? And you know, he's laughing at me on the radio.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000 And not only went out for get it, those are the things that just the right intervals in my career.
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000 Right when I was about to go over the edge of unbeatable, I'm better than everybody.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000 I never got to that point because something would always happen and go, and I would go, oh, damn.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000 That guy is better than me.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000 Trim did that to me at a time where had had that not happened. I just didn't fight against him. There's some risk that I could have just left there and gone off the deep end and look back and go.
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000 I was the best pal in the world, which is in a ridiculous thought.
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.000 I was lucky that every interval where I got right to the edge, something would happen to me and go, dude, that guy is better than you.
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000 And it happened just enough. Now, that doesn't happen to a lot of people.
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000 And, and, what do you mean that doesn't, what doesn't?
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000 The, the reminder, there are people that manage to get through and not have that experience happen.
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000 And, and the irony is that there's, there's, there's more humility at top gun than you would think because it keeps happening.
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000 When you get stratified in an organization like top gun, that is humbling because everybody gets there for the same reason.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000 You get there because you are the best.
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:29.000 And then you get there and then you kind of start stratifying inside that and that little tear that I was talking about that line and then the three or four.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000 Everybody knows who those guys are. Everybody, especially if you're not one of them.
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000 And that, that is, that is a humbling thing in and of itself.
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000 And if you make it up there, the only risk is if you kind of believe it like, oh, I'm here because I'm better than everyone.
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:56.000 If you don't get beat at some interval, that's where you can kind of go, hey, I have done something that nobody else can, I've made it to a place that nobody else can make.
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000 That fight against trim, you could call him right now and he would, he would know exactly what I'm talking about.
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000 Because he also knew it from the, he had been in, this was third time on the staff as an instructor, he'd been there three times.
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000 He had seen it all.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000 And the crazy part about that was where the first three fights are set up.
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:25.000 I don't think so. I really don't. I think the set up for him was the third, the second merge of the fourth fight, where I looked over and I'm like, ah, he's slow.
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000 He can't make this turn. He can't do this maneuver. I'm going to, I can draw it out.
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.000 I unload and I said, he doesn't have the airspeed to fly over the top. He can't do a loop in this case.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000 The difference was, as my threshold for loop airspeed, which was really low, his was lower than mine.
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000 And that's something. Why? Because of his aircraft, because of his, because of his skill.
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000 His ability to fly. So I have a, we'd have a thing called, so you could do a, like, friends and you could do a loop in a half a mile and he could do one in, it's more of a mile.
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000 It's more of speed, but yeah, so we had a thing called min vertical airspeed.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000 We would teach guys, below 150 knots, you cannot go over the top. You can't loop your jet.
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000 We did that to keep people from, you know, spinning airplanes out of control.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000 My min vertical airspeed was way lower than that. Like what?
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000 No, no, I mean, at this point, I don't, I'm, I'm good. Probably, I don't know, 115, 100.
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:32.000 You can milk it up 120. And, and his, because he was a better pilot than me, he was able to fly his airplane closer to the edge of being out of control than I was.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000 And I did my math of, nobody can do that. I can do that.
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000 And I got right to my, my min vertical airspeed. He was slower than me, which meant I actually had an advantage over him.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000 I had more speed than him, probably 10 knots over him. So these are really fine margins.
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000 But that 10 knot differential didn't affect him as much as it affected me.
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000 So when I wound up, and I literally looked this way, thinking he'd be falling off, you have to be left.
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000 And, and he wasn't there, and I'm like, well, where else could he be?
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000 And he was actually inside my turn above me, and I'm, and I'm part of the thing like, you physically can't do that.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000 Like, you physics won't allow that.
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000 The only thing that allowed us, and, and you remember Dan Petterson talking about flying the airplane beyond the facility.
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000 Yeah, absolutely. That's what I was thinking.
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000 And, and at the end of it, the simple Twitter described it, that guy was a better pilot than I was.
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000 He could do something in his machine that I couldn't do the exact same machine.
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000 And the, and the outcome was, he wins.
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.000 And not like a little advantage. It was a lopsided one sided at the end was he's directly behind me laughing at me.
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:41.000 If you can't get some humility from that and go, oh, I, okay, I've made it all the way up here, and there's still someone better than me.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000 And thank God those things happen to me, Jocca. Like, thank God that happened to me.
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000 Because I can keep, I take that with me, and, and I keep that, and that was a really good lesson for me.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000 Had that been reversed? Who knows, man?
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000 Yeah, General Boyd, when Dan Petterson was talking about the fact that he went to the conference in General Boyd was talking,
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000 who is the, you know, and he's saying, look, this is what the aircraft really, we can do it.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000 We can calculate more, and all the top gun guys are going, we can do things that are beyond that.
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000 That's right. And what that reminds me of is that you'll be doing Gigi into someone.
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000 And now have some capability that's not normal.
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000 The two capabilities that might not be normal, one is flexibility.
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:31.000 Someone that's massively flexible, and you get past their guard, and you think you're past their guard, and there's no human that's going to be able to take the leg and put it back in front of you.
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:43.000 And yet they do it, or someone that's just psychoshrong, and you get across side on them, and they kind of bridge and get a position with their hands, and you're going, what are you going to do? Push me off of them.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000 And that's pretty freaking crazy, but it's a similar thing that there's no possible way you think.
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000 There's no human that's going to put their leg in front of me right now.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000 Jeff Glover. Jeff Glover like your past is guarding, and there's a leg coming over your side, and you're thinking,
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000 Yeah. Who is there someone else on the map with us right now?
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000 Because a human can't do this. Well, he's doing it right now, and he's got your back.
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000 And the other thing I was thinking about was I was on my first deployment to Iraq, and we were doing a bunch of ops and it looked.
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:20.000 At this point, I was very lucky because there wasn't a lot of people that we were the only platoon.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:28.000 And I rack it this time. For a short period of time, I had the only platoon in Iraq, and we were tossed up with some people, but I had the own, imagine that.
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000 I'm imagining that. All the seals I have the only platoon in Iraq.
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:41.000 So it's freaking awesome. And I remember, and then eventually, you know, now the other platoon started coming in when my other platoon started coming in, my commanding officer came in.
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:57.000 And we had a really good relationship, guide work from before, and we had done a series of operations, rapid operations, really tight turn times, and got the targets we were going after.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:04.000 And I remember, my commanding officer gave me some incredibly strong compliment.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:16.000 You know, like, I mean, now it sounds completely ridiculous. At the time, it was this, you know, really strong compliment about what incredible, you know, ground breaking and all this stuff.
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000 And I looked at it, remember, I looked at it, and I said, hey, sir, give me 24 hours, and I'll screw it up.
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:31.000 Because, and the reason I said that is because I don't only saw operations, you're like, man, so many things can go wrong. Bad things can happen.
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000 And I don't even, you know, and we had already had some bad things happen. You know, we'd already had some mistakes. We had already had some things that should have gone different.
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:52.000 And maybe they didn't quite leak out to, you know, maybe we kept them inside the platoon, like, hey, dude, what were you doing? Why were you over there? If we would have, you know, if we didn't deconstruct it that moment, you could have got shot like, like, some things where we got away with it, right?
01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:04.000 And I got away with some mistakes. And so he's telling me what a great job, and I just looked at him as he gave us 24 hours and I'll screw it up. And, and that to me is something I always tell myself, you know,
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:13.000 there always have that always have that, that person whispering in your ear telling you that all glory is fleeting because it is.
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:39.000 I think that lesson is, it's impossible to say how important that is. And you probably know this, but every single day at work at echelon front, no matter what good work we've done, no matter what impact made, no matter what the client tells me, how great echelon front is, every single new phone call, every single, every time I do the same thing I've done 100 times, I think about that.
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:54.000 And that event I was talking about in the earplane, that's why I think like that. And I think like that every single time, every single day, I'm about to start off a keynote that I've done 100 times or 400 times.
01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:06.000 And I think, you don't want to screw this up, you got to get this right. You can undo all the work that you've done by not having this be as good as every other one that you do.
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:30.000 So there's so much value in that recognition. And for me, being reminded that at my best, there's still somebody better, that I keep with me every single day, every day and everything that I do. So losing is sometimes a good thing.
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.000 We're about to jump into the next section before I went down that tangent education. And by the way, we're on page six now out of this chapter, we're moving right along.
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:48.000 Professional military education from Marines Intensity Develop Creative Thinking Leaders in a continuous progressive process of development.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:59.000 Those are some words that people do not think of when they think of the United States Marine Corps or the military at large, creative thinking leaders in a continuous progressive process of development.
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000 This philosophy aligns well with the kind of education Marines need to succeed in competition as well as in war.
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:14.000 While the nature of competition endures over extended periods, like war, its character constantly evolves.
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:25.000 Rivals continually strive to improve their competitive advantages, strive to gain the initiative, and strive to keep their competitors off balance.
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:39.000 If you wake up in the morning and you just read that line to yourself, that your rivals are continually striving to improve their competitive advantages, they're striving to gain the initiative, and they're striving to keep you off of balance, that's a good thing to wake up to in the morning.
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000 Because it's really easy to forget that.
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:52.000 Education is a primary method for Marines to sustain competitive advantage over time.
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:04.000 I'm going to say that again, what's the primary method? Is it marksmanship? Is it battle exercises? No, they're saying education.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:11.000 Now, it's a primary, but a lot of people don't think that that even falls in the top 10 for the Marine Corps education.
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:20.000 As Marine leaders progress through their careers, they need to develop mastery of the concepts that provide an ability to lead organizations like the Marine Corps through cycles of innovation.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000 Cycles of innovation that are essential to staying at the forefront of competition.
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:36.000 These concepts go beyond just adaptation. They go beyond just, look, if you're just adapting to what's happening, you're wrong.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000 If I'm just adapting to what you're doing, Dave, I'm wrong. I'm wrong. I need to be making you adapt to what I'm doing. I'm going to be on offense.
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000 They include topics like organizational learning, the ability for an organization to sense changes in its environment.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:03.000 Not react to changes in its mind, but sense those changes. You know, lately I've been talking a lot about, but just being more aware of what's happening when people ask me, well, the home life balance.
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:17.000 You know how much I'm supposed to say, hey, the answer is you need to balance them. How can I help you? I can help you by making sure that you're more aware and you're more attuned to when things get off balance. You need to sense those things more.
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:29.000 And you need to sense changes in the environment and approve. It's effectiveness and efficiency in response to those changes change management when leaders are able to implement needed change in an organization while keeping its people engaged.
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:43.000 And the difference between sustaining and disruptive innovation, which is essentially a difference between incremental improvements of what already exists versus new and better approaches that displaced the old methods over time.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:55.000 That's what we're trying to do. It is not enough for Marines to educate themselves on war and war fighting alone. Such a narrow focus limits the benefit they can give to the nation.
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:12.000 Most of our Marines career will be spent training in the fleet marine force or serving in a support establishment, understanding competition and how the Marine Corps contributes to it is an essential skill, especially for career Marines who will have the greatest impact on the Marine Corps competitive attributes over time.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:22.000 Self-education in social, economic, technological and other matters beyond military history and leadership are essential if Marines are to excel in competition.
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:32.000 Now, what's really cool about working at National Humphrum and working with all these different companies is we get to work in economic environments.
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:59.000 We get to work in technological environments, we get to work in construction and manufacturing to work in all these different environments. And what's awesome is when we can take what we know and we can overlay it into those things and get to see and get to learn how our principles impact even in these this wide array of different environments.
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:19.000 And that actually makes us smarter because when I see how a principle, when I see how cover move applies in a manufacturing plant and I see how it works in a financial company and I see how it works in a sales organization.
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:26.000 When I see all those things, guess what I know better, I know cover and move better, I understand it better.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:49.000 And that's what they're talking about here. The better you understand all these different aspects of what's going on in the competition between America and other nation states, the better you can see how your, how your organization contributes to that competition and how you can better contribute to that competition.
01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:02.000 The goal for education then is to foster awareness with the campaigning mindset of how all capabilities available to Marines can fit into and support a larger competition strategy.
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:18.000 It should improve knowledge of openness to the interests of potential and existing allies and partners. The outcome we seek from education is to increase the ability of Marines to envision greater possibilities and competition.
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:26.000 Next section talent management our doxion of maneuver warfare places a premium on individual judgment and action.
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:41.000 Wait a second, we talk about the Marine Corps is never just fallen orders. No, we place a premium on individual judgment and action, which also means we recognize all Marines of a given grade and occupational specialty are not interchangeable.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:55.000 They should be assigned to billet based on specific ability and temperament. This expression of talent management found in war fighting applies equally as well to competing. People have different strengths and weaknesses.
01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000 The organizations that compete most effectively place their people in position to use their strengths.
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:18.000 Now, this is something we get asked to quite a bit and you know what I wrote about leadership strategy and tactics. Hey, if I've got if Dave is really good at at at sales and he's not that great at administrative duties.
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000 What should I do with it?
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:36.000 Well, I'll tell you what you put him in sales. That's when he's good at let him go do it now does that mean you let him just ignore the administrative part and he never has to touch paperwork and we hire some it. No, no, no, no, we want to strengthen his weaknesses, but we want to utilize and capitalize on his strengths.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:50.000 We also coach their people on the development of their strengths and link their use to the organizations goals. Some people excel at planning and creating new designs for operations and organizations others excel at taking a blueprint and then optimizing it so it works as well as possible.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:26:04.000 If you have the ability to do all these things with equal skill to compete at peak effectiveness, marine leaders need to measure the talents of the people they lead and then match these skills to the duties they perform organizations that do this well and for a sustained period.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000 Also have a sustained competitive advantage they maximize the performance of their people over time.
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:22.000 That answers a lot of questions if you're in a leadership position. You find someone that's good at something let him do it.
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000 Force planning.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:39.000 Force planning which includes the functions of design development and management of the force for the Marine Corps must balance utility at many points on the competition continuum with building a force that is a functional tool for the joint force to use in winning battles.
01:26:39.000 --> 01:27:08.000 The output of this complex undertaking must serve the needs of competing generally and of war fighting in particular realizing that they both exist on the same continuum and that they are interrelated shapes shapes are overall approach to this planning. So we could take the Marine Corps and if we only wanted them to be good at war fighting, we would do things differently.
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:18.000 We would change entire, entire portions of the way we raise Marines.
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000 We would get rid of certain parts of the table.
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000 What are you talking about?
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000 We need to know marksmanship, we need to cover moving.
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000 That's what we need to do.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000 We need to be awesome at our tactics.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000 We need to know how to win.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000 We know how to interact with each other.
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000 Catch people in the combined arms and level. That's what we're going to focus on.
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000 There's a whole other bunch of stuff that we focus on.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000 Well, that the Marine Corps focuses on.
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000 And what they're saying here is you have to find that balance.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:50.000 You've got to be able to compete, which means we've got to be able to go out and shake hands and make friends and build relationships.
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000 And we've got to be able to fight.
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000 We've got to find out we've got to balance those two and we've got to realize that they're both interrelated.
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:07.000 So this happens with companies where companies, hey, we've got to make money.
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000 We've got to make money. That's great. Guess what else we have to do?
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000 We have to maintain our reputation.
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000 Because we can make a ton of money and blow our reputation out the door.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000 Or we can have a great reputation and now we're going bankrupt.
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000 So what do we need to do?
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000 We need to find balance on these two things.
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:35.000 To do this successfully, the output of our force planning should present a dilemma to our potential competitors and defeat their plans against us.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:42.000 The way we combine our organization, the way we combine our organization, doctrine training and equipment should produce a competitive advantage or multiple advantages.
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000 The options we choose within each of these elements affects our competitiveness over time.
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.000 For example, if we enhance the training for equipment mechanics so that they can operate for extended periods without external support,
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000 then we also enhance our ability to operate in austere environments for a long period of time.
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.000 The output of force planning is the sum of choices made inside each of these elements.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:23.000 These choices must be guided by the goal of establishing competitive advantages, which are useful for combat, and also useful for competition.
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:31.000 Having that goal, when you make sure that you're sticking with your goal, you have to be guided.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000 Your choices are guided by the goal of establishing these competitive advantages.
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000 That's what you're making our choices based on.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000 Is this going to give us a competitive advantage or not?
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000 That's a very good way of simplifying your decision making process.
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000 How is this going to give us a competitive advantage?
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000 If it's not, why are we doing it?
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000 That competitive advantage is something you have to have to be successful, and when you're making the connection to business,
01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:01.000 especially when you're just looking at the most basic level of what consumers want.
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000 They've got a bunch of options.
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.000 They can get the product of the thing you make usually from a whole bunch of different companies.
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.000 The competitive advantage is how you can deliver it to what they want better than everybody else.
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000 If what you're doing isn't contributing to that, that I think over time,
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000 we've talked about complacency, the other things, the inability to recognize that you have to continue to contribute to that competitive advantage.
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000 That doesn't stay.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000 If you have that competitive advantage, now your competitors aren't trying to erode that and take that away from you.
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000 Even the idea that everything you're doing has to be designed to contribute to either building or sustaining that advantage.
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000 Or you're going to go away.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000 You will be out maneuvered by your competition.
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000 I love that even in the Marine Corps they're saying it's useful for combat and competition.
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000 Those are two different things and we're telling the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps telling Marines.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000 Those are two different things.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.000 Which is interesting because they're also saying throughout this entire book that those are on the same continuum.
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:12.000 So I'm going to do something that's going to be useful at multiple locations on that continuum.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000 Because if all we cared about is you being good at combat, we would raise Marines just like you said in a totally different way.
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000 And we would forgive a whole bunch of things that happen like that's okay.
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000 He can do all those crazy things because when we go to war, we're going to unleash that guy.
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000 And we know that's not enough.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000 You can't do that for a whole bunch of different reasons.
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000 And the recognition that hey combat is combat is going to happen.
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000 I mean, certainly in this image, you're going to see some combat.
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000 But that might be fleeting.
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000 You might get one opportunity, a one good deployment, but the competition piece and they've said it over.
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000 That is happening all the time.
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000 It'll hold a bunch of different ways.
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:59.000 Continuing on, if we are to fully prepare, then Marines need to also consider the merits and challenges of asymmetry in competition.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:06.000 Truly asymmetric asymmetric competition actions or competitive actions can impose costs on the rival.
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:16.000 For example, the original assault breaker concept developed in the 1970s and 1980s was an asymmetric response to the Soviet advantage in armor and number.
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:23.000 So in Europe in the 70s, they had this massive, the the the Soviet block had more armor than we did.
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000 And if they attacked it was their armor versus NATO armor, we they had the numbers.
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000 So they came up with this this plan, which was, hey, as soon as something breaks out.
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:46.000 We're going to attack deep behind enemy lines with long range weapons missiles to to take out all those extra tanks that they have.
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.000 So that was that was something that we that we came up with to to negate their competitive advantage.
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000 That that will here.
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000 It says improved sensors with precision munitions to negate the Soviet advantages.
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000 So I guess I could have just read it.
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:21.000 The execution of force planning starts a cycle that begins putting forth the theory about how we can contribute to the nation strategic competitions throughout the continuum building capabilities to bring theory to reality and then testing the capabilities to exercises and operations.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000 So again, now they've gone from guessing.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:34.000 Well, I'm going from guessing to hypothesis now it's putting forth the theory right my theory is because that's another word for guess it's another nice word for I'm going to take a guess my theory is.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.000 And then you take those and you take those theories and you put them to the test just like a hypothesis in exercises and operations.
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000 Let's see how they work.
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000 Other political actors observe this theory unfold and adapt themselves so they can compete more effectively against it.
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000 That's what's going to happen.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000 Our observations of these adaptations starts the cycle once again.
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.000 Force planning then is a continual effort to stay ahead of potential adversaries.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:12.000 Thus we see that force planning itself is a competitive act and the Marine Corps must retain the ability to reconfigure the force when necessary to sustain its competitive advantage or develop new ones.
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:25.000 This ability starts with the mental flexibility that comes from humility and the disciplined practice of questioning assumptions.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000 Tattoo that on your forehead.
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000 Well, maybe on your forearm so you can see it.
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000 We don't want to have to look in the mirror.
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:42.000 This ability that we should be constantly checking and seeing where we're at and seeing what adaptations the enemy is making.
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.000 The competitors are making and if we don't have mental flexibility.
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000 We're wrong and if we don't have humility we're wrong and if we don't have discipline we're wrong.
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000 I think these people listen to the podcast.
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000 That's what I'm thinking.
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000 I'm thinking that the authors listen to the podcast.
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000 Let us know.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000 Our awareness of the competition continuum and its existence both above and below the threshold of violence.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000 Brawls are view on force planning.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000 So the better you understand that.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.000 The better you understand that the the game is much bigger than hey we're going to fight you.
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000 With violence the game is much bigger than that.
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:30.000 Our philosophy is that we can as we have done in the past prepare Marines to succeed in competition without sacrificing the Marine Corps's ability to prevail in battle.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:44.000 Our understanding of ourselves must include how the Marine Corps fits into the complex adaptive system that is the naval service and the joint force.
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000 We know that the Marine Corps is operated on both sides of the violence threshold and expect this to continue into the future.
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.000 However, our campaigning mindset should lead us to explore thoroughly how the Marine Corps can contribute to preventing war.
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000 We can look at a little cyops.
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:09.000 How the Marine Corps contributes to preventing war by regularly operating below the violence threshold even as Marines are ready to operate above it when required.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000 I had some had a note here and I don't even know what it meant.
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.000 When I talked about preparing the Marine's to succeed in competition without sacrificing the Marine Corps's ability to prevail in battle.
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000 I have in parentheses harder than you think.
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000 Oh and then I have as an example I have college sports teams.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000 Okay, so now it makes sense.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000 The example I thought of as if you've got a college sports team.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000 If the simple example would be hey if the only thing we want these athletes to do is play football.
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000 Everything's out of the table.
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000 Well, it gives you a lot of capability on the football field, but let's face it.
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000 No one has anything other than football when they're done.
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000 So you have to balance it.
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000 It's an example of echo Charles.
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000 Hey, he's not doing well in geometry class.
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000 He's got a D. We need to bench him.
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000 Well, what if he's our best player?
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000 We don't want to bench him, but we have to balance it.
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000 Now on to the conclusion.
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:29.000 The Marine Corps is one of the nation's tools for the strategic competition that is the normal state of events in international relations.
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000 And by the way, man.
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:41.000 As you watch the news, as you read the news, which I recommend.
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:49.000 If you think about the international news and you pay attention to the competitions that are going on,
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000 it all this makes a lot more sense when you see what China's doing.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000 When you see what I ran's doing.
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000 When you see what's going on in Syria, when you see what's going on in the Middle East, when you see what's going on in Europe,
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:10.000 when you see what you start to think about all those things from a more holistic viewpoint and you overlay the fact that it's one big competition which looks.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000 That's the way it is. Look at what Russia does.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000 Look at what Russia does.
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000 See, they are competing.
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000 They are competing.
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:37.000 And not only that, sometimes echo Charles, people around Russia, like people other than Russia, they're out playing flag football.
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000 And Russia is playing tackle.
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000 You know what I'm saying?
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:51.000 There, someone else is playing Tai Chi, and they're playing combat sombo.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000 And the Tai Chi people are thinking like, oh, you know, and also they get punched in the face.
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000 Or they're in a bad position.
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000 More worse, they're in a bad position. They don't even know it.
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000 They don't know the capability that that sombo practitioner has.
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000 So you've got to pay attention that. You've got to start singing that these little maneuvers, these little maneuvers that these other nation states make. They're not.
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000 I can't even believe I'm having to say this right now.
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000 But you can watch things happen.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:27.000 And the way people respond to it, it's almost as if it's just by chance that this other nation state is making this maneuver.
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000 And throughout this book, and I wish I would have, should have been doing this all along,
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000 you can find examples of where this is happening.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000 Oh, there's a boundary getting stretched. Oh, there's a salami slice.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000 Like all these things are going on. Oh, there's a, there's a below the violence threshold maneuver.
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000 And they're going to back off right before there's a response coming. This is what's happening all the time.
01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:00.000 There's a competition piece inside that too that I think about is, we were talking earlier about hierarchy.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000 Everybody kind of knows the hierarchy too. Everybody kind of knows where we are in the hierarchy.
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:17.000 And what, what that should tell us is that they know, which is even more reason for them to be competing all the time,
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000 because they know where they sit and they don't like being there.
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000 They don't like being there. And that is true for nation states.
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.000 And that shop that you're running on that street corner. If the hierarchy is known, which it almost always is,
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000 the other people in the hierarchy that are underneath you don't like that.
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000 They also know that they can't go toe to toe with you. They can't do the brute force method and just run you out.
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000 So they got out maneuvering you and how compete you with little tiny moves here and there.
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:54.000 And when you were talking about the idea of, I can't believe I have to say this is the complacent that comes from being at the top of your food chain,
01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.000 your food chain, whatever it is, everybody else knows it's going on. And they're all trying to out maneuver you.
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000 So you shouldn't be surprised by any of it. That's what they're doing. You were saying earlier,
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000 you're out on the weekends going to the club. They're home, sharpening their knives.
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000 And that's what they're supposed to be doing.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000 And actually, sometimes they're not even sharpening their knives.
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:24.000 What they're doing is they've got a bar out in town that they're working with.
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000 That's giving free drinks for you.
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000 And so even though they can only sharpen their knife so much, so what are they going to do? They're going to weaken you.
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000 You got to be on the watch for that.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000 You've ever seen the movie training day?
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000 Yes.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000 Excellent film, by the way.
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000 That's what that whole movie was about, essentially.
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000 So he was trying to, you know, he basically had this new recruit who do anything he wanted to make the team or whatever.
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000 So we set him up to have to do everything yet, like he asked him to do.
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000 It started with making a smoke that we eat or whatever.
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000 If you are some movie, you'll understand.
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000 And even says in one of the pivotal parts, when he's manipulating him, he says, hey, it's chess.
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000 It's not checkers.
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000 So like, yeah, if you don't know you're in a competition or whatever, essentially the explanation.
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:23.000 Where you're just like, oh, yeah, today we're just sort of cruising, where, and actually you're example of like, okay, if you know where you are in the hierarchy,
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000 or hierarchy, and you're, let's say you're high, and you have all these challenges, people or entities, right?
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000 You're kind of cruising, and they know they can't go to the tooth you without you, how you put it.
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:46.000 But their move can be like 10 years down the road, and they're plotting for that 10 years, they're plotting for that move, or that series of moves, you know.
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000 So we got Denzel plays the bad cop essentially.
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000 Yeah, Lanzo.
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000 Who plays the other one?
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000 Jake is played by Ethan Hawke.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:02.000 Okay, so, and that's the first escalation is smoke and pot.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:12.000 Oh, the first escalation starts in the beginning, so like right, the way he talks to him in the beginning, where you could tell this guy, Jake is like, he just wants to make the team, he wants to do everything.
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000 So it starts without eating.
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000 By the way, is that whole movie take place in one day?
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000 Yeah, or is that just the name of it?
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000 Oh, that's all one day.
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:18.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:27.000 Because I was going to say what's interesting about that is, if Ethan Hawke, Jake, wait, Jake, wait, hey, hey, hey.
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:35.000 If he would have gotten a brief prior to that day starting, that there was a competition happening, and there was maneuvers that were about to be made.
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000 Yeah.
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000 He wouldn't have, you know, if he knows that this guy is maneuvering, it's like, hey, you need to smoke this week.
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.000 No, no, that's not happening because to me, once he got him to do that, and I don't know, I don't remember the movie, that's almost checkmate, right?
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:56.000 That's almost checkmate, like, hey, dude, well, I'll get you, you need to get pissed tested, and now you're out of the force, and now you're in trouble,
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:08.000 now you got a bad reputation, or, not even a bad reputation, you got a, what's, what's an RE4 code in the military where you're not allowed to get a federal job anymore, but you got a bad thing happening, you got a dishonorable discharge.
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000 That's a checkmate move, almost out of the gate.
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000 It's literally how it played out because that was like one of the first major moves.
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000 And it didn't come into play until later when he was like, hey, kill that guy.
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.000 But if he, if he would have been aware of the competition that was happening,
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:34.000 he would have known, hey man, this is not a good move, hey, I'm not doing that, and that's totally, actually would have flipped, almost flipped the checkmate.
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:44.000 Oh, deal, the whole deal is flipped, but you're not aware of it, you get a lower than, well, maybe, I mean, obviously it was a movie, so,
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.000 there was, he always had it, you ever put out that qualifier before, no, you just treat movies like that reality.
01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:00.000 He did in there, I mean, you're right, obviously, but in that particular movie, he had him by the, he had him by the ball's the whole time,
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:08.000 because Jay Quate went into a thing, he wants to make the team, he's even, he's even beyond not knowing that he's competing.
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:19.000 He's in like the, he's in the, beyond opposite direction where he's thinking that he wants to like prove and be, be a part of the team, you know,
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:28.000 the opposite of competing, exact opposite, and it's funny you say that two words like, oh, that was checkmate, where he was like,
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000 one that came up when he's like, hey, kill the guy, he's like, not gonna do it, he's like, in fact, you know what, I'm tired of this whole thing,
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:42.000 I'm turning you guys in, he's like, yeah, go ahead, but what's gonna happen when they pull your blood, you've been smoking weed and math all day or not math, it was like PCP or whatever,
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000 all day having you and he's like looking at him, you can see the wheel, you're getting a smoke PCP or is it like intertwined in the pot?
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:58.000 Yeah, exactly right. So it was weed, so he made them smoke the weed and then after he smoked it he was like, dang, I didn't know you smoke BCP, he's like, you did, I haven't, but you have now, you know,
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000 like that kind of like, like, did Denzel's character smoke weed as well?
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.000 No, he made him, he put a gun to it. Yeah, he was like, hey, and the way he crashed, have he seen somebody do?
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.000 The way he rationalized it was like, hey, if you refuse weed in an undercover situation, they're just gonna kill you.
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.000 So you gotta be ready to do this kind of stuff. And he's like, oh no, he's like, I don't want you on my team.
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:27.000 Gun do is out on my team, you know, we put that gun. Do is head? Yeah, just as like a, like a demonstration.
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000 Well, like what if it was like this? Exactly right. If we were on the street, you'd be dead right now, like that kind of stuff, you know?
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000 So it's kind of like, he learned, it's almost like he'd Jake felt like he was learning this big, huge impactful lesson at that time, you know?
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:46.000 Where he's like, yeah, you gotta kind of, get to push it far sometimes, you know, to throw them out.
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.000 Yeah, kind of. Or did he brow beat him? He brow beat him, kind of both.
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000 He actually, the whole movie is him doing one or the other, is weird.
01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.000 It's a weird, it's a weird, a mini-pulation thing. Yeah, and finally when he was tired of it, he was like, I'm not doing this. He was like, oh yeah, but you've been smoking PCP all day.
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:08.000 So you kind of got a, and all my guys were in on it, they're all gonna say the same thing and he's like, and he kind of has to do it.
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:15.000 Then soon, like right after he's like, hey, I know it's crazy, I know, but this how it is, you know, we gotta be wolf.
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000 Wait, does that come up?
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000 Sparrow there, doesn't come up? No.
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:27.000 Uh, since we're talking about training day, I have a small request, you may or may not comply, but let's face it.
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000 When you give me the, okay, it sounds a lot like the Zell Washington, that's here.
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000 I'm not gonna do it, but that's exactly where I got it from. No, I know that, because even though I don't know that movie very well,
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:49.000 Yeah, there was a little, if I get a little overly hostile with you, kind of one of your defensive mechanisms is to throw that.
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000 Okay, back at me.
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000 They broke there was a tear it.
01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:02.000 There was a time in training day, in the beginning, he meets a metadiner, and he's like, oh, the guy Jake, he's trying to make small talk, you know, it's awkward and a lot of,
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000 a lot of, he's reading the newspaper, and he's like, not talking to him, it's awkward.
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000 So Jake keeps trying to make small talk, he's like, hey, shut up, let me read my paper.
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000 Jake's like, oh, awkward.
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:22.000 So he can't help himself. He has to say something again, just to fight the awkwardness, and then he's like, put it down the paper. He's like, hey, tell me a story.
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:29.000 He's like, what are you talking about? He's like, but you want, I read the newspaper for the stories or blah, blah, blah, he says it's like, so you gotta tell me a story.
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:36.000 So they start telling the story and then, in the part when he's like, oh, yeah, I'm with this, my training officer, she was a girl or whatever.
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:44.000 He's like, oh, it's a girl training officer. Oh, man, that's, he's like, yeah, he's like, oh, right, all right, all right, all right.
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000 So that's where it came from.
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000 Audit, you use it in different contexts, but yes, got it from. Thank you.
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000 Talk for that.
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:58.000 It always makes me smile. If I can push you to the point where you throw that at me, I know I did my job for the day.
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:13.000 The, the manipulation, you gotta be on the lookout for it. You gotta be on the lookout because if you're not competing all the time, if you don't recognize that you're competing, that's when you're going to get caught.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:21.000 And you should never, never, ever give that kind of leverage to another human being. Over you.
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:30.000 Not to go back to training day too much, but there's, there's smoking. We part when he realized it when he was like, hey, it's fucking busy.
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000 He all day, haven't you? And he's like, he looked at me, he's like, you've been planning this all day. There he goes. I've been planning it all week.
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:44.000 So you'm saying, no, that's the demonstration. Hey, you're always competing last week. We didn't even meet each other. I was already out still competing.
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:59.000 I didn't look at you now. I'd lessen their everywhere. I kind of forgot about that. I'm just retracing myself to the last four years and trying to make sure I know what's actually going on here.
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.88 to the book for the conclusion as professionals
01:50:00.88 --> 01:50:03.24 Marines acknowledge this condition and prepare themselves
01:50:03.24 --> 01:50:05.64 and the Marine Corps to succeed in this struggle.
01:50:05.64 --> 01:50:08.40 Adopting a campaigning mindset helps us do this
01:50:08.40 --> 01:50:12.36 effectively as it aids us in visualizing the long timelines
01:50:12.36 --> 01:50:15.12 that often span years and decades.
01:50:18.04 --> 01:50:21.04 This influences the type of education they say.
01:50:21.04 --> 01:50:26.04 I mean, it's so crazy to not think about years and decades.
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:31.04 That's if you're not thinking in years and decades,
01:50:31.04 --> 01:50:33.04 you're going to have some issues.
01:50:33.04 --> 01:50:36.60 Yeah, I'm proud of not a thinking years and
01:50:36.60 --> 01:50:37.84 I mean, whatever.
01:50:37.84 --> 01:50:40.64 Typically, we don't think in years and decades.
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:43.64 Typically, I mean, we're for a handful of things, but that's it.
01:50:45.64 --> 01:50:47.64 And those handful things, what I'm talking about.
01:50:47.64 --> 01:50:48.84 Yeah, this is important.
01:50:48.84 --> 01:50:51.84 This influences the type of education they seek to prepare them
01:50:51.84 --> 01:50:54.88 for the continual innovation that will be required to sustain
01:50:54.88 --> 01:50:57.24 competitive advantage and create new ones over the course
01:50:57.24 --> 01:50:58.12 of long-term campaign.
01:50:58.12 --> 01:50:59.84 It also influences their decision.
01:50:59.84 --> 01:51:02.20 They're thinking on talent management because the most
01:51:02.20 --> 01:51:04.68 competitive organizations are the ones that get the most
01:51:04.68 --> 01:51:07.28 from their people by placing them in positions to use their
01:51:07.28 --> 01:51:08.76 strengths on a regular basis.
01:51:08.76 --> 01:51:11.80 All of this preparation leads to the type of agile force
01:51:11.80 --> 01:51:15.92 planning needed in long-term competition, resulting in a succession,
01:51:15.92 --> 01:51:20.48 a succession of force planning that outcomes,
01:51:20.48 --> 01:51:23.60 planning outcomes that achieve and then sustain competitive
01:51:23.60 --> 01:51:26.60 advantage advantages in the military element of national power.
01:51:26.60 --> 01:51:32.48 That's the conclusion there of chapter three, almost two hours
01:51:32.48 --> 01:51:32.84 deep.
01:51:32.84 --> 01:51:38.28 So a good place to stop for now, because I don't even want to crack
01:51:38.28 --> 01:51:44.72 open chapter four yet too much for one night.
01:51:44.72 --> 01:51:48.76 So we're always in competition.
01:51:48.76 --> 01:51:51.96 We should be in strategic competition.
01:51:51.96 --> 01:51:56.60 And all of this chapter three, we are preparing for competition.
01:51:56.60 --> 01:51:58.96 Echo Charles.
01:51:58.96 --> 01:52:00.12 Here comes the tee up.
01:52:00.12 --> 01:52:01.84 Here comes the softball coming your way.
01:52:01.84 --> 01:52:03.80 Let's see if you can knock it out of the park.
01:52:03.80 --> 01:52:06.000 In speaking of preparing for competitions,
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.24 do you have any suggestions that will help us stay prepared?
01:52:09.24 --> 01:52:10.48 Yeah, it takes up limits.
01:52:10.48 --> 01:52:13.12 And here's why straight to it.
01:52:13.12 --> 01:52:14.56 Yep, here's why.
01:52:14.56 --> 01:52:17.52 So you know, okay, so we'll start with the joint stuff as we always
01:52:17.52 --> 01:52:18.36 do this as way.
01:52:18.36 --> 01:52:20.60 So a lot of times, I'm one of these people,
01:52:20.60 --> 01:52:23.80 but I don't have joint problems, right?
01:52:23.80 --> 01:52:25.80 Until you do, seems saying.
01:52:25.80 --> 01:52:28.20 So that time, if we're not thinking that,
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:30.92 that if we're not considering the fact that we might have
01:52:30.92 --> 01:52:32.64 these issues with joints, we're lifting weights,
01:52:32.64 --> 01:52:34.72 we're doing the jujuts.
01:52:34.72 --> 01:52:37.40 And we're not anticipating the potential for joint problems.
01:52:37.40 --> 01:52:40.28 We're not going to be competing in that way,
01:52:40.28 --> 01:52:42.28 or aware of that competition.
01:52:42.28 --> 01:52:43.60 Okay.
01:52:43.60 --> 01:52:46.48 We also need to be strategic in the way that we're thinking.
01:52:46.48 --> 01:52:48.04 Because we are putting a wear and tear,
01:52:48.04 --> 01:52:50.20 it might not hurt you right now,
01:52:50.20 --> 01:52:53.64 but guess what you're doing in two years, three years, five years.
01:52:53.64 --> 01:52:57.32 You want to keep those things maintained in the Navy,
01:52:57.32 --> 01:52:58.80 in the Marine Corps that we know about.
01:52:58.80 --> 01:53:00.28 I'm sure it's this way in the Army near for us.
01:53:00.28 --> 01:53:03.36 Well, you're going to follow these maintenance protocols.
01:53:04.56 --> 01:53:07.44 And they're going to help when you need that element,
01:53:07.44 --> 01:53:08.72 when you need that piece of equipment,
01:53:08.72 --> 01:53:11.88 when you need that shoulder, that elbow, that knee.
01:53:13.08 --> 01:53:15.40 And look, you need, let's face it.
01:53:15.40 --> 01:53:18.04 It could already come with a kind of genetic disadvantage.
01:53:18.04 --> 01:53:20.64 You might have knees that are skinny.
01:53:20.64 --> 01:53:24.92 They need all the help they can get.
01:53:24.92 --> 01:53:25.76 Oh, yeah.
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:28.04 And if that's the case.
01:53:28.04 --> 01:53:29.72 Hey, you get these supplements.
01:53:29.72 --> 01:53:33.76 Listen, we are doing something at Jockel Fuel
01:53:33.76 --> 01:53:37.72 to try and help out.
01:53:37.72 --> 01:53:40.36 So what we're doing is if you,
01:53:40.36 --> 01:53:43.76 we know that shipping is expensive,
01:53:43.76 --> 01:53:48.000 we know that people are already paying for the product.
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.80 And now, this and they got to pay for shipping, too.
01:53:50.80 --> 01:53:53.84 And what we want to do is we want to give you a way
01:53:53.84 --> 01:53:56.000 to get that shipping cost down.
01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.20 What we got to get it down.
01:53:57.20 --> 01:53:58.80 We got to get it down a lot.
01:53:58.80 --> 01:54:00.80 We got to make it free.
01:54:00.80 --> 01:54:03.68 If you subscribe to any of these items,
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:06.32 if you subscribe to any of these items,
01:54:06.32 --> 01:54:08.04 shipping is free.
01:54:08.04 --> 01:54:13.20 It was in January, but now it's free period.
01:54:13.20 --> 01:54:14.04 Straight up.
01:54:14.04 --> 01:54:15.80 Free period.
01:54:15.80 --> 01:54:18.52 And if you subscribe, you save money, too.
01:54:18.52 --> 01:54:19.48 You save like cost.
01:54:19.48 --> 01:54:21.36 The cost goes down by 10%.
01:54:21.36 --> 01:54:25.72 So if you want to be prepared,
01:54:27.04 --> 01:54:28.72 if you want to be competitive,
01:54:29.88 --> 01:54:33.000 and you want to help out your bank account,
01:54:34.16 --> 01:54:37.64 hey, go subscribe and the shipping is free.
01:54:38.52 --> 01:54:40.20 And you get 10% off, which is pretty cool.
01:54:40.20 --> 01:54:43.48 So we're trying to make this stuff more available
01:54:43.48 --> 01:54:45.40 easier to everybody.
01:54:45.40 --> 01:54:46.64 So that's what we're doing.
01:54:46.64 --> 01:54:49.76 Join warfare, superkrill, discipline, discipline,
01:54:49.76 --> 01:54:54.04 go, even the drinks shipping for free,
01:54:54.04 --> 01:54:56.72 mock shipping for free, strawberry, chocolate,

01:54:58.84 --> 01:55:00.000 if you want to get it.
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.52 Just stay.
01:55:01.52 --> 01:55:02.44 Yeah, that's good.
01:55:02.44 --> 01:55:03.80 That's going to help you later.
01:55:03.80 --> 01:55:04.64 It's going to help you.
01:55:04.64 --> 01:55:06.04 All these things are going to help you later.
01:55:06.04 --> 01:55:07.32 Yep, in the campaign.
01:55:07.32 --> 01:55:08.08 True, sorry.
01:55:08.08 --> 01:55:11.88 Also, other things are going to help you later.
01:55:11.88 --> 01:55:13.68 You can also get this stuff at Wawa,
01:55:13.68 --> 01:55:16.04 where you can get the ready to drink.
01:55:16.04 --> 01:55:16.88 What do you drink?
01:55:16.88 --> 01:55:17.64 What do you have tonight, Dave?
01:55:17.64 --> 01:55:19.56 You went too deep and so did I.
01:55:19.56 --> 01:55:20.60 We started recording late.
01:55:20.60 --> 01:55:23.36 We both kind of like, it was a early morning.
01:55:23.36 --> 01:55:24.20 I know that.
01:55:24.20 --> 01:55:25.04 Well, flavors did we go?
01:55:25.04 --> 01:55:27.56 I went afterburn orange with a deck savage.
01:55:27.56 --> 01:55:28.40 Follow up.
01:55:28.40 --> 01:55:31.32 I went, jacer, deck savage, jacer.
01:55:31.32 --> 01:55:33.76 I went, I went, I went,
01:55:33.76 --> 01:55:34.76 I went, jockel Palmer.
01:55:34.76 --> 01:55:40.12 And then I went sour apple sniper, JP, appreciate it.
01:55:40.12 --> 01:55:41.12 That's what I went.
01:55:41.12 --> 01:55:45.24 So I went, we both went back to back, back to back, back to back.
01:55:45.24 --> 01:55:46.24 I don't do that very often.
01:55:46.24 --> 01:55:47.48 No, I was thinking too.
01:55:47.48 --> 01:55:49.88 I don't usually start hitting this, this late at night.
01:55:49.88 --> 01:55:51.08 But I know it's an idea.
01:55:51.08 --> 01:55:52.52 I have work to do when I get home too.
01:55:52.52 --> 01:55:54.84 So that's a positive thing.
01:55:54.84 --> 01:55:55.84 You can get it.
01:55:55.84 --> 01:55:57.48 You can also get the stuff at the vitamin shop.
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:01.68 So hit those up or get the free shipping.
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:03.28 There you go.
01:56:03.28 --> 01:56:04.28 It's true.
01:56:04.28 --> 01:56:07.36 Also at originmane.com, this week, you can get stuff as well.
01:56:07.36 --> 01:56:08.36 Yeah.
01:56:08.36 --> 01:56:10.36 It's a lot of other cool stuff at origin.
01:56:10.36 --> 01:56:11.84 Originmane.com.
01:56:11.84 --> 01:56:14.24 All American made stuff by the way.
01:56:14.24 --> 01:56:17.16 The boots, jeans, jiu-jitsu stuff.
01:56:17.16 --> 01:56:18.96 Do you ever watch Pete?
01:56:18.96 --> 01:56:20.28 Do you ever watch Pete?
01:56:20.28 --> 01:56:24.44 Do you ever watch the origin USA Instagram story?
01:56:24.44 --> 01:56:26.08 Yes.
01:56:26.08 --> 01:56:28.04 So the other day Pete Roberts.
01:56:28.04 --> 01:56:29.20 Sure.
01:56:29.20 --> 01:56:34.04 He made a story about how he was all fired up because he bought.
01:56:34.04 --> 01:56:38.12 We bought originusa.com.
01:56:38.12 --> 01:56:39.12 Okay.
01:56:39.12 --> 01:56:40.12 The domain name.
01:56:40.12 --> 01:56:41.12 The domain name.
01:56:41.12 --> 01:56:42.60 And he was all fired up.
01:56:42.60 --> 01:56:48.12 And he was, he spent 50 grand on that.
01:56:48.12 --> 01:56:49.12 And he's all fired up.
01:56:49.12 --> 01:56:50.72 I don't know if you do.
01:56:50.72 --> 01:56:53.40 Do you know anything about buying what's called the URL?
01:56:53.40 --> 01:56:54.40 Do you know anything about this?
01:56:54.40 --> 01:56:55.40 Yes.
01:56:55.40 --> 01:57:02.12 So if it's a kind of a good word, they can be very, very expensive.
01:57:02.12 --> 01:57:07.08 IE for originusa 50 grand.
01:57:07.08 --> 01:57:08.48 $50,000.
01:57:08.48 --> 01:57:09.48 And he's on there.
01:57:09.48 --> 01:57:13.08 And he's like, you know, a couple of years ago, I wouldn't even dreamt of spending 50
01:57:13.08 --> 01:57:14.08 grand for this.
01:57:14.08 --> 01:57:15.08 But this is where we're going.
01:57:15.08 --> 01:57:17.08 We need this new URL.
01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:18.48 So we're doing it.
01:57:18.48 --> 01:57:20.48 We're executing.
01:57:20.48 --> 01:57:25.24 And I didn't, I didn't have time because I saw the story.
01:57:25.24 --> 01:57:32.08 We, me, also bought another domain name, which will be a big one.
01:57:32.08 --> 01:57:34.36 We up soon.
01:57:34.36 --> 01:57:41.84 And people, you could argue would say this is even more valuable name URL.
01:57:41.84 --> 01:57:46.32 I bought jaco.com.
01:57:46.32 --> 01:57:47.48 Jaco.com.
01:57:47.48 --> 01:57:52.24 And I almost posted this because what I was going to say, and this is the true story,
01:57:52.24 --> 01:57:54.48 I bought jaco.com.
01:57:54.48 --> 01:57:55.80 How much do you think I paid for it?
01:57:55.80 --> 01:57:57.44 Originusa costs 50 grand.
01:57:57.44 --> 01:57:58.44 Dave, what do you think?
01:57:58.44 --> 01:57:59.44 How much do you think I paid for?
01:57:59.44 --> 01:58:01.32 I think it's unfair for me to answer this question.
01:58:01.32 --> 01:58:02.32 So you already know the answer.
01:58:02.32 --> 01:58:03.72 It makes you so you can get it.
01:58:03.72 --> 01:58:09.76 So if you want to, so I got jaco.com for $1.
01:58:09.76 --> 01:58:11.48 Now awesome guy owned it.
01:58:11.48 --> 01:58:12.76 And he's a trooper.
01:58:12.76 --> 01:58:13.76 He's in the game.
01:58:13.76 --> 01:58:17.48 And he just reached out to Jamie and said, hey, I own jaco.
01:58:17.48 --> 01:58:18.76 And we get all kinds of things.
01:58:18.76 --> 01:58:19.76 We get all kinds of Jamie for us.
01:58:19.76 --> 01:58:20.76 He said, hey, what do we do?
01:58:20.76 --> 01:58:21.76 Hey, what do we do?

01:58:45.96 --> 01:58:49.84 Meanwhile, I got jaco.com for $1.

01:59:16.60 --> 01:59:17.60 What'd you pay for?
01:59:17.60 --> 01:59:18.60 $9.
01:59:18.60 --> 01:59:18.60 11.
01:59:18.60 --> 01:59:19.60 You got to love it.

01:59:21.60 --> 01:59:22.60 I don't know.
01:59:22.60 --> 01:59:23.60 I think you did buy that either way.
01:59:23.60 --> 01:59:24.60 Yes.

01:59:33.52 --> 01:59:36.76 It's where you can get Americans made stuff.
01:59:36.76 --> 01:59:39.12 Also, we have the store.
01:59:39.12 --> 01:59:40.52 JacoStore.com.
01:59:40.52 --> 01:59:41.52 I bought that one.
01:59:41.52 --> 01:59:44.08 By the way, back in the day.
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:45.08 This is where you can get this money.
01:59:45.08 --> 01:59:46.08 Could you put that name here?
01:59:46.08 --> 01:59:47.08 Sure.
01:59:47.08 --> 01:59:49.28 I think you thought of that one.
01:59:49.28 --> 01:59:50.28 No, actually, I know I didn't.
01:59:50.28 --> 01:59:51.52 I like, I go, what is it?
01:59:51.52 --> 01:59:52.52 You like, jacoStore.
01:59:52.52 --> 01:59:54.28 I was like, oh, I guess we're going with that thing.
01:59:54.28 --> 01:59:56.12 Yes, it's not hard when to figure out.
01:59:56.12 --> 01:59:57.12 I remember two.
01:59:57.12 --> 02:00:00.08 We're like, yeah, jacoPotCats because it's simple or whatever.
02:00:00.08 --> 02:00:01.88 I was like, I had to online store.
02:00:01.88 --> 02:00:03.88 There you go, jacoStore.
02:00:03.88 --> 02:00:04.88 Oh, there.
02:00:04.88 --> 02:00:05.88 And, you know, it's yours.
02:00:05.88 --> 02:00:06.88 So, boom.
02:00:06.88 --> 02:00:07.88 Anyway, this is where you can get this money.
02:00:07.88 --> 02:00:12.88 You can see them shirts and hoodies and hats and, a lot of cool stuff there.
02:00:12.88 --> 02:00:15.96 There's a T-shirt club called the shirt locker.
02:00:15.96 --> 02:00:18.16 You want to tell us that it?
02:00:18.16 --> 02:00:19.16 I did.
02:00:19.16 --> 02:00:23.88 So, you know, you no longer have to say T-shirt club, which sounds super wack.
02:00:23.88 --> 02:00:26.24 You can just say we all swept the shirt locker.
02:00:26.24 --> 02:00:29.76 You can just say it in a much cooler way.
02:00:29.76 --> 02:00:30.76 Yeah.
02:00:30.76 --> 02:00:31.76 Okay.
02:00:31.76 --> 02:00:35.16 You can just exclude the lame things that sometimes get said.
02:00:35.16 --> 02:00:36.16 Yeah.
02:00:36.16 --> 02:00:37.16 My king shirt.
02:00:37.16 --> 02:00:38.16 Okay.
02:00:38.16 --> 02:00:42.44 Well, thank you for coaching me up there.
02:00:42.44 --> 02:00:44.44 Jaco, there's the shirt.
02:00:44.44 --> 02:00:45.44 Sure.
02:00:45.44 --> 02:00:49.24 Sure, locker where you can get a new cool T-shirt every month.
02:00:49.24 --> 02:00:53.88 High quality, high speed, low drag, as Jaco always says, either way.
02:00:53.88 --> 02:00:54.88 You've never actually heard me say.
02:00:54.88 --> 02:00:55.88 It's like, it's a good thing.
02:00:55.88 --> 02:00:58.28 You can go to check out, it's a good thing to check out.
02:00:58.28 --> 02:01:00.92 So, hey, man, if you think that's cool going to do that, it's that.
02:01:00.92 --> 02:01:03.32 Chocolate store, so like I said.
02:01:03.32 --> 02:01:06.68 You didn't mention the fact that at origin mained.com, you can also get jeans.
02:01:06.68 --> 02:01:07.68 You can get boots.
02:01:07.68 --> 02:01:08.68 Did you?
02:01:08.68 --> 02:01:09.68 Yeah.
02:01:09.68 --> 02:01:10.68 Dave, did you say that?
02:01:10.68 --> 02:01:12.96 Dude, this week can be going to for two years.
02:01:12.96 --> 02:01:14.80 I have no recollection of you saying that.
02:01:14.80 --> 02:01:15.80 Okay.
02:01:15.80 --> 02:01:17.68 Well, there's jeans and boots and guess what they're American made.
02:01:17.68 --> 02:01:18.68 That was a bad.
02:01:18.68 --> 02:01:19.68 True.
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:20.68 That's absolutely true.
02:01:20.68 --> 02:01:22.68 Hey, kid, so review the tape.
02:01:22.68 --> 02:01:23.68 No editing.
02:01:23.68 --> 02:01:26.76 This is going to sound like a dumb question from you.
02:01:26.76 --> 02:01:27.76 Yes, sir.
02:01:27.76 --> 02:01:28.76 Okay.
02:01:28.76 --> 02:01:29.76 Okay.
02:01:29.76 --> 02:01:30.76 Bear with me.
02:01:30.76 --> 02:01:33.80 So the origin boots are those good for snow.
02:01:33.80 --> 02:01:34.80 Yeah.
02:01:34.80 --> 02:01:38.28 I mean, I know what you're tracking, but like, yeah, so if you're snow.
02:01:38.28 --> 02:01:39.68 Yes, if you're out in your ins know, they're good.
02:01:39.68 --> 02:01:44.68 If you're going to go on a winter hike in the woods, they're not going to be optimal,
02:01:44.68 --> 02:01:45.68 because they don't have any insulation.
02:01:45.68 --> 02:01:49.92 Now, if you put on a pair of wool socks and maybe a little polypropylene socks underneath
02:01:49.92 --> 02:01:51.32 them, you might be pretty good to go.
02:01:51.32 --> 02:01:56.40 Plus if you add it a little, you know, waterproofing to it, you know, you got some oils.
02:01:56.40 --> 02:01:57.40 You can put in there.
02:01:57.40 --> 02:01:58.40 You'd be good to go.
02:01:58.40 --> 02:01:59.40 Go on it.
02:01:59.40 --> 02:02:04.20 But if you're going on a trip to the mountains where you're going to be, it's going
02:02:04.20 --> 02:02:05.20 to be called when you're walking around.
02:02:05.20 --> 02:02:06.20 You'll be good to go.
02:02:06.20 --> 02:02:07.20 No, almost stuff.
02:02:07.20 --> 02:02:08.20 Yeah.
02:02:08.20 --> 02:02:10.24 I figured that what I guess is not a dumb question, right?
02:02:10.24 --> 02:02:11.24 I thought it was a good question.
02:02:11.24 --> 02:02:12.88 Well, and they're in Maine.
02:02:12.88 --> 02:02:17.28 Yeah, norm on it would be a dumb question if you were from Maine.
02:02:17.28 --> 02:02:20.12 Being that you're from Hawaii, it's actually a totally legit question.
02:02:20.12 --> 02:02:25.72 Your environment has not taught you lessons that a new Englander would learn or someone
02:02:25.72 --> 02:02:29.92 from Michigan or Montana would learn.
02:02:29.92 --> 02:02:32.28 Why oming people wouldn't be asking me that question?
02:02:32.28 --> 02:02:33.28 No.
02:02:33.28 --> 02:02:36.88 So it's not common knowledge for people like us from the Ina.
02:02:36.88 --> 02:02:37.88 All right, cool.
02:02:37.88 --> 02:02:38.88 Boom.
02:02:38.88 --> 02:02:39.88 There it is.
02:02:39.88 --> 02:02:46.48 Also, subscribe to this podcast if you want and leave a review on your podcast player.
02:02:46.48 --> 02:02:47.48 Of choice.
02:02:47.48 --> 02:02:51.80 Yeah, and we also have, you can join the the Jocco Underground.
02:02:51.80 --> 02:02:52.80 Jocco Underground.com.
02:02:52.80 --> 02:02:54.80 There's some people are asking questions.
02:02:54.80 --> 02:02:56.40 Wait a second.
02:02:56.40 --> 02:02:57.40 What's happening?
02:02:57.40 --> 02:02:58.40 Yes.
02:02:58.40 --> 02:03:00.40 And I'm like, oh, I explained it.
02:03:00.40 --> 02:03:02.40 This podcast, Jocco podcast.
02:03:02.40 --> 02:03:04.52 The goal is to never change this.
02:03:04.52 --> 02:03:08.88 The goal is to never put this podcast behind a paywall.
02:03:08.88 --> 02:03:11.32 That's the goal.
02:03:11.32 --> 02:03:14.000 We want this to be free.
02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.44 And as long as that is humanly possible, it will be.
02:03:17.44 --> 02:03:23.32 And the only thing you will have to suffer through is this section that we're listening
02:03:23.32 --> 02:03:24.32 to right now.
02:03:24.32 --> 02:03:26.28 If you can bear with that, which you didn't even have to.
02:03:26.28 --> 02:03:30.12 In fact, I know that there's only four of you listening right now.
02:03:30.12 --> 02:03:32.68 If you can bear that, you can listen to this for free.
02:03:32.68 --> 02:03:36.28 And you can also just press stop and you didn't have to hear any of this crap.
02:03:36.28 --> 02:03:37.28 Thank you.
02:03:37.28 --> 02:03:41.48 But look, we also, we set this up as a contingency.
02:03:41.48 --> 02:03:44.92 So we have an alternative platform that we built.
02:03:44.92 --> 02:03:46.32 We don't want to have other sponsors.
02:03:46.32 --> 02:03:50.48 We don't have somebody cutting in when we're talking about the battle of the bulge
02:03:50.48 --> 02:03:54.84 to tell you about what kind of underwear you should use.
02:03:54.84 --> 02:03:57.12 We don't want that to happen.
02:03:57.12 --> 02:04:01.68 So if you want to help us out with that, you can go and you subscribe to the
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:02.68 Underground.
02:04:02.68 --> 02:04:08.32 And in order to give you some benefit, a tangible benefit, we're recording another podcast
02:04:08.32 --> 02:04:11.64 called the Jocco Underground podcast.
02:04:11.64 --> 02:04:14.92 And we just kind of give some other information.
02:04:14.92 --> 02:04:15.92 They're a little bit shorter.
02:04:15.92 --> 02:04:22.56 They're just, they're just, it's a behind the scenes, some, some amplifying information
02:04:22.56 --> 02:04:26.000 about what we talk about, some of the where this podcast came from, how I thought of doing
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.92 this, why we're doing this.
02:04:27.92 --> 02:04:31.80 So if you want, you can do other, you're going to jocco Underground.com.

02:04:42.80 --> 02:04:47.68 If you can't afford that, and you still want to listen to the Jocco Underground podcast,
02:04:47.68 --> 02:04:48.68 it's cool.

02:05:22.24 --> 02:05:23.24 podcast.
02:05:23.24 --> 02:05:31.76 Again, I said this the other day, I owe a buck on January 31st and when that's done, my
02:05:31.76 --> 02:05:34.28 plan is to knock out some Warrior Kid podcast.
02:05:34.28 --> 02:05:39.92 We got a YouTube channel where Echo puts up all the videos of this podcast and other
02:05:39.92 --> 02:05:46.04 videos where he makes a bunch of stuff blow up using CGI because he thinks it's cool.
02:05:46.04 --> 02:05:48.48 It's 100% cool.
02:05:48.48 --> 02:05:49.48 Thank you.
02:05:49.48 --> 02:05:52.60 Well, that's just your opinion.
02:05:52.60 --> 02:05:56.60 We have an album called Psychological Warfare where I talk about overcoming moments of
02:05:56.60 --> 02:05:57.60 weakness.

02:06:01.12 --> 02:06:07.84 bunch of books, leadership strategy, and tactics field manual.
02:06:07.84 --> 02:06:12.60 Which I pull out to read quotes from all the time when I'm talking to clients.
02:06:12.60 --> 02:06:13.60 Oh yeah, that's a question.
02:06:13.60 --> 02:06:15.60 I heard about this here.
