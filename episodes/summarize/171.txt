and I always always told him like when he told me that I was like I felt like my legs were like a lizard's tail you know it's like they're grow back like you see it on the news all the time what you've never expected to happen to yourself and here I am I didn't care nothing about the vision I just wanted my legs back because it was it was tough those first two or three weeks after I get out of ICU like I wouldn't eat nothing I was so skinny I could barely lift my head up off the bed and the hospital banned that they gave me would go all the way up to my my bicep pretty much because I just wouldn't want to eat I wanted to die like the nurses hated me like one of the nurses coming like two in the morning I finally got some sleep and she kept poking me around with the needle you blew your ACL that was like since I really did blow my ACL 10 to 12 to land like 15 years earlier my other site I knew that my knees were loose because the gut the doctor at that time was like hey you have really like I don't know long legaments I don't know I know that sounds funny like long legaments I know and we would I mean we would literally patrol them down the streets at K-bay Kanye O'Bay Hawaii and they had a couple old barracks that we'd work mounts you know we do mount training with and with simmerounds and you know we do we do what it bellows which was like a little air force base that they were starting to create like a mount town and that's when we did a lot of our training and kind of our field work and now at this point are you starting to think and you got guys that are just coming back from Afghanistan are you starting to think like okay now I really need to start paying attention the reason I'm asking you these questions is because I'm trying to relate you know when I joined the navy it was 1990 there was like I guess the Gulf War was kind of on the horizon and it's uh so it's like I work out as much as I possibly came because it's like I never know what you know this organization I do a lot of events with like sometimes I'll just call me up like hey you want to do a Spartan race in two weeks it's like oh sure you know I didn't want my life to you know revert back to pain pills and just you know I feel a little bit of pain then then I'm going to go like go take a pill and you know I replace that with Stan Busy staying active going to the gym working out and and it really helped out a lot I didn't just you know if I felt like I got pain then I'm gonna go give it some pain you know but you know like last year I climbed out right here or half a half a mountain here and this year I'm going to go out and sum it up hopefully in July so I just uh anything I can do to really like challenge myself and always I always tell my prosthesis and like any like I got the X3 on my left leg which is like the best of the best and I'm like my goal in life is to break this leg and you know the Marine Corps you know it's the joining the Marine Corps in 2004 was the greatest decision in my life for the reasons like this right now because it was the Marine Corps that was there each and every day in my hospital room talking to me and helping me understand that this road that I'm getting ready to go down you know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and not only talking about my deployment or talking about the Marine Corps but just talking about life and coming in there joking around with me and because you know looking back on it now like I'm truly fortunate and blessed to be here today because the amount of blood I lost was a body's worth of blood my left leg was taken from me I have a piece of my small intestines taken out you know shred no winter both my eyes but he doesn't look the way he sounds Matt's like oh good cool thanks because otherwise he you know he might have said something like you know maybe if you're trying to put on weight like maybe echo needs to all right just by sound like you maybe need to do some squats when I was in the hospital I had like a color every time I would make fun of somebody then they would be in the room and I love it you know it's just this is what I've been given and I might as well accept it and move on you know improvise something that we're always learning the Marine Corps and you know when I when I do speak in engagements I focus on a lot of things in the Marine Corps that I learned like a depth and overcome and you know the next one is lead by example which you know a lot about I'm sure and then the next one's never quit and through it all through those three attitude is everything if you walk into any situation with the positive attitude that's the first step to success if you think about something negatively then you're never going to accomplish anything so when I was laying in that hospital bed there was no negative thoughts you know oh you're gonna get your big goal you know you got your big goal in the future but what you have to do is you have to set up these little goals along the way to get you there at that point in the right direction so your big goal is you wanted to stay in the Marine Corps be able to read less than order to be able to do that you had to be able to walk you had to be able to function and so you just had to fight through these little things every single day to make progress and it's funny because you know the way I've honestly described this before is like it's like shooting when you're looking you know you got your target that's far off in the distance 400 meters away if you stare at that thing your vision's gonna get blurry and and I think and it really um it made the trip as we were flying back home we were going over Iceland and the pilot brought back this little letter and he gave me to my buddy and my buddy right at two minutes said US forces have killed us on bin Laden and I was like you know what that's the perfect closure to a closure trip because like we all joined the military after 2001 to go after him you know to kill him and and knowing that this happened on my closure trip it's like it honestly like gave me it got me emotional they just get down in the dumps and they give up and really it's like you got to learn to battle through those adversities and you know at the end of the day when you put your head down the pillow and close your eyes you wake up to a new day you know and a new day with new challenges but you got to learn to overcome those challenges because in life it's a mountain you're going to continue to climb up a mountain and it's never going to flatten out you're constantly going to go over any you know obstacles, boulders, whatever's in your way and the only way to go over is to climb it it's not to find an easy way around or turn around and quit you know and you know once we left Alessad we took we flew up to the hath ditha dam and mill the night say they're overnight we started loading our mags and we got in a big convoy and we drove into a hath ditha and it was I mean you just like you hear the stories of hath ditha from three three and then when three one went through there stint before and and it's just while while west and again you only see it on TV you never expect to be walking the same streets and you know this stuff going on but you know the first time we went out on patrol it was it was nerve wracking it was like it's like you do this in training so much you know we do some case work with veterans but truly it's just getting out of the district and being around veterans and kind of letting them know what kind of legislative bills are out there that could affect them both positive and negatively I mean there's so much out there that they need to know about and it's been truly a joy you know getting it will work with a lot of Vietnam veterans and you know these are some of the happiest guys that I've ever met my life for what they had to go through you know and you know through it's like you know through it's like each year I try to find something new to do and for some weird reason this year I was like I've got on the stationary bike because my goal is to in July I'm going to bike from Seattle to Portland it's like a 203 mile two day event and it this picture starts to get uh kind of painted in my head when I hear like these cool stories so like I don't know you know like if you're uh it's gonna be a bad analogy but bear with we all know you're good but he went up to her and gave her a birthday he invited her to his birthday and it like he come home and told me in a man to that and that truly brought tears to our eyes because it's like they get it you know when I was their age if I saw a kid that was in you know a special wedge class I didn't walk up and try to talk to him you know I felt like they were different than me and I say to away from that and this is when I realized that what I truly love to do that my true purpose in life was to serve this country wearing the uniform and it was taken from me like here I am in the United States while my brothers are wearing Iraq fighting right now I felt like a coward like they would try to they would call me when they could and I wouldn't want to talk to him on the phone like I would always tell him with some kind of excuse that I'm sleeping or I'm doing something just so I didn't have to talk to him because I felt like I let him down and that it killed me and then once once my dad told me that I lost my legs that was the worst thing in the world so how was the school of infantry it was cold in North Carolina we were during that time there were so many guys going through the through infantry school and a lot of guys were just like there for a couple months three months and you know like you go to the childhood and you got a like a 10 to 20 like a snake line of rose and rose of Marines going to try to eat child but it was just like you could fill it from your seniors because they they experienced like casually they experienced death over in Afghanistan they knew what combat was like and you started understanding that this is serious now this thing you know the same video game or a joke you're getting ready to go to war and you know five six seven months or even tomorrow you never know you know positive but here in people like just it's it's hard to hear people complain about things these days you know and because you know I know what Iraq looked like but you've got to find a way life isn't easy life's hard and and if they could look at me and look at what I've gone through and what I continue to do today and use that as motivation to you know better themselves and better their lives and understand that yes I might have failed this test but you know what I'm going to go home and I'm going to get in the book and I want to I'm going to get an A on this next one and that's all the matters and you know talk about them a little bit it's Nolan who's 15 he'll turn 16 and a couple weeks a couple years ago we had a birthday party and there is this girl in his class or in his school that had no arms and no legs and he didn't know her I'm like what he's like I want to kill you like what did I do now you know that's like like we all come back alive and I feel like that I feel like that was my new mission in life that you know we're all brought on this earth to serve in some kind of purpose serve some mission and you know sharing my story and going out doing things that I'm doing today is inspiring and motivating others not those who were injured in combat but people who are living you know a civilian life today I'm either going to come home my brothers I'm coming home in the body back there's no in the middle and and here I am now down this whole dark path this new road you know as a 20 year old how in the world am I going to live my life now like I got I don't even know what a blind guy no legs can do I what point did you realize that you weren't going to be able to see anymore it was pretty much more sick and I believe was my last surgery that they tried to kind of like give me some vision back and nothing come back from that and and then of course Christmas times it on a roof and how often were you guys getting in direct fire into your into your fob with any you guys with mortars all out we got mortar at about every every day about five o'clock you know chal time and one of the times like we had a I don't know it was like a hill there's like a big sand hill in the middle of our fob but you know like I got so much other that closure trip I learned a lot about my life and like what the next step in my life is and like I mentioned earlier like when I went back to Afghanistan in 2017 never been Afghanistan before my life and you know the brothers that I met in the Marine Corps and in the military alone like they're forever going to be there you know no matter where you live out in this country they're always going to be there for you and knowing that the you know the the name tag across your chest you know the states of America that that means more to me than anything in this world and if if I was called back to serve this country again and again no one the risk and what could happen to me then I'd go back and do it all over again because these last 12 years have been truly amazing and I've done things that I would never thought I could do but you know through you know setting these goals early on in my rehab like you know reenless in the Marine Corps was the one thing that I wanted to do and so learning how to walk I focused on that more than my my blindness because I knew learning learning life you know in the dark would be a lot easier with legs and that helped out so much because I tried to maneuver around in a wheelchair being blind and a long cane and all this stuff and you know for everybody out there listening you know when when life gets tough just remember that one day at a time and you put your head down and close your eyes and the next day will will be over or the the old day will be over and the new day will be there so just push on better yourself go to the gym work out love life and enjoy everything that we have to offer here in the out states awesome and thanks to everyone that has served and is serving in our military and I started off this podcast by reading the oath that you all swore to defend us so thank you all out there in our military for taking and keeping that oath and obviously Matt thank you so much for taking that oath for taking that oath twice for keeping that oath despite everything that it been put in front of you thank you for your service and your sacrifice and thanks for coming to talk to us also policing law enforcement firefighters paramedics EMTs correctional officers border patrol first responders and that includes dispatchers that are staying calm on the phone on the radio to get people to help that they need when they needed thanks to all of you for protecting us as well we owe you all a debt of gratitude and to everyone else that's listening I'm going to take a quote from Matt Bradford's Twitter and it says this to walk this earth blind is not the same as having no vision to walk by faith unchanged by the hand delton is to live life as a visionary and to love life as humans were meant seek never settle inspire never complain rise never stay down no legs no vision no problem and let's face it if Matt Bradford can do what he does if he can keep pushing and keep driving and keep finding new missions and successfully executing those missions if he can wake up every day and say no legs no vision no problem if he can have the vision he has and the heart that he has then all of us can stop complaining and we can go get after it and until next time this is Matt and echo and jockel out I think so because a lot of times at school of infantry we did a lot of fire team stuff and you know we did a lot of hikes every Thursday once we got back from the field but a lot of it was like this learned weapons learning how to shoot a pop-up targets and like move in targets and just kind of like learn just kind of learn the whole weapons and systems and stuff. it's you know that's something I come up with like a couple years ago like doing an event and it's like you know what it just kind of stuck and next thing but I've noticed this so you know how like when you they're like little babies or whatever you'll give them like I don't know all kinds of stuff and let's say you give them formula but the formula is kind of sweet and but you know it's like even through even through training my trainer it's funny because I joked with him all the time I'm like his name's Josh and I'm like like you're just here to walk me from a machine I'm shane
