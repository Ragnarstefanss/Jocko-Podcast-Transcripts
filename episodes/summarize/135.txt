but I think that that natural tendency to be exposed as as someone who doesn't know something to be exposed as someone who doesn't have all the answers to expose as a leader who doesn't know everything I'm gonna let you in a little secret everybody already knows that everybody knows that you don't know everything and if you try to act like you do it will make it ten times worse than just saying I actually don't know what to do here or I made a mistake here when you make a mistake everybody knows it your subordinates know it your peers know it your boss is know it and the worst thing you can do is to tell them that you didn't that's why being insecure in your leadership capabilities is a downward spiral because the more insecure you are the more you try and manipulate the main thing everything and keep everything under your wraps and do everything your way and that's how it is so when you're insecure as a leader and that's another that's another thing that takes a little bit of a leap of faith that's another like progression that I personally made I personally made and I can't remember when but when I was like you know what it's because and when I pulled it when I started going through hack again about Facebook and I started reading that I realized that you got to change your perspective as a leader it's not just it's not just hey because we simplify it like well if your millennials aren't doing what you want it's your fault that's that's a simplification of it because what you really got to do is you got to shift your mindset a little bit and say like what wait a second how do I take advantage of that's what hack worth was doing hack worth was same wait a second how do I take advantage these guys guess what they're going to question me if I do something wrong they're going to report things that are done correctly they're going to say no if I plan something stupid is that a bad thing let me think about it actually no that's actually not a bad thing so if you've got a millennial that's like hey if I don't like the leadership here I'm leaving the company guess what let's get that person some good leadership you got a millennial that says hey if I don't understand why we're doing what we're doing like your reading reports but you're not there mentally well look combat for me was dropping a bomb in Iraq you know and Afghanistan was a certainly more aggressive experience for me you know it was a lot more regular pace there was certainly some risk involved but you've talked about the first combat experience on this podcast a lot we've talked about just the first combat experience as well I did not really get it until I saw it and actually in some ways you could say I didn't get it till I heard it you know the sounds of combat what it really sounds like to have a bullet go past your head so close to you can actually sort of gauge how close it was to your head and whether it was closer to the guy next to you three feet away closer to you who was the sniper actually looking I've had those thoughts I know you have too so the sights of the sounds of that it's just it's hard to replicate and I've actually been in MBS you've talked about the training that you did for your guys at task in bruising some of the things you did I didn't do a lot of those things you know and I'm going to kind of sell like hey boss you know those guys aren't they're not they're not the best guys you know this is not the best team here's here's a here's a say let's call it a drill or a coaching I'll call it that a coaching when the next time you get into a situation and you write down and you take the excuses and the reasons that you come up with look at them and then figure out how they were how those things were actually your fault and or how you could have prevented them because a lot of times it's like here's here's here's one hey boss we didn't get the mission accomplished because the weather rolled in and we couldn't launch on the mission that's that's the problem now we all know that we don't control the weather so when you we'll tell you write the problem down we failed the mission because we didn't control the weather we we can't control the weather that's why we failed the mission that's my excuse that's a that's a logical reason there's that's that's a that's a legitimate excuse but don't use it what you do is you say what could I have done to have controlled the weather and the exact opposite is true and like when the people and I work for people that I despised and I despised because that how they treated me how they treated other people and it's very evident like don't be like that it doesn't work I'll be in a group of leaders you know we're doing to work with the company I've done this many times where I'll set it up with hey who here has had someone in your life as that would that that was in charge of you that invested in you and took care of you raise your hand and everyone raised their hand and or 99% of the people raise their hand if not 100% of people raise your hand because that's you know usually we're talking to leaders in the company and so the leaders have made progress somehow and they've made progress because someone at some point taught them and took them under their wing and cared about them and you you take that very seriously when you're in a position you're gonna you're gonna be one of the deciding factors in whether that person stays or goes anytime you get to that point where you're in mind like hey the best thing is to get rid of this guy and if you bring him in for this are that final interview that final interaction the guarantee way to seal your fate the guarantee way to ensure what they've already kind of concluded because that's why they're bringing you in in the first place is to not take any responsibility it's not taking any terms that is 100% guarantee now it doesn't mean that you might just not be able to you might not have the technical skills of capability sometimes you're gonna get fired and and sometimes your mistake is so agriest and does so much damage you gotta go you're gonna get fired but even then the the best thing you can do the best thing you can do is to take ownership of all that and be like hey boss I understand I'm sorry or you can go the other route and you can start to throw everybody under the bus it's just a complete nightmare it makes you wonder how any of that is is makes any of it remotely functional like how does that system function at all under that setting under that environment how could anybody at the bottom of that hierarchy be willing to go do any of the things they went and did you know you're talking about you know this thing from from Bella wood they're they literally know most of you're gonna die we're gonna charge across open fields and a machine guns we use that example at echelon front is something that you would never do and that's what they were doing I mean border line just human waves if we do it enough we're gonna get 50 75 yards of terrain out of it we're gonna move the line 400 yards and you actually execute and implement what you said you're going to do guess what you will accomplish the mission that there's a whole part of ownership that pre-empts the problem if you've got someone that knows if I know that I can make an excuse if I know that I can make an excuse think that's what I'm not gonna set things up properly if I don't set things up properly more often or more often than the other way I will fail to execute what I'm supposed to execute if you have an excuse right same same thing with you as an individual human being if you as an individual human being if you got some excuses that you can throw out there that you can say I had no control over that then you know what you say okay I read the the preface out loud to myself and having had read it three four times I'm just hearing it it was like reading it for the first time the the voice that you give that makes it makes the words become real like a like that person wrote the book is saying out loud and that difference there it's not subtle it's huge it's a huge huge thing that that is one of the great things about when people do it when they do it on podcasts and you're putting somebody else's voice in action most of the time reading books by people that are long gone and you're telling stories that nobody would ever hear and even if you read them it misses something it's it's what you're not doing I think like if you know like I see what you're doing I see you're doing there using your little chocolate tricks all this stuff that's not the influential part you're not doing you know it's so funny now because everyone I deal with now every single person that I deal with on any level on any on any depth at all they all know all my little tricks as you call them they all know every every person I'm involved with knows them all yeah we use the analogy a lot we talk about this in our front and like hey it your folks when you're pushing your folks too hard it's like it's like driving a car in the red you you're running this car in the red you're running hard and if you keep them in the red too long that car is gonna break and then just gonna break now you can you can push to the red a little bit you can kind of throttle up it and and do that and I felt that several times in my career and the response to it is it's all the same and one of the best things about responding to those situations is that as a leader you're really busy there's a lot to do you you've got a lot going on a lot of decision you have to make a lot of things you have to be aware of and that's actually one of the best remedies for all that and you know it's probably really tough for someone it really junior in the organization that may feel like it doesn't know what's going on doesn't have a real sense of those things I was never really bored so if you just kind of do the math it's just not a lot of time everything I think about every leadership lesson every when I hear you talk about a book when I read a book when I think all of those things the frame of reference I have the thing I think about is those seven months and had I not had those seven months of and look Ramadi obviously was it was a maddening place it was crazy but if I didn't have that I don't think I would be able to appreciate or understand and without that frame of reference without that understanding of some connection to that it actually makes it difficult and I would have never guessed it if I would have tell you hey I'm going to look back on my 23 year career and all those things I heard you listen to my bio it's always strange here someone read it out the the the the the the most powerful thing in that was seven months in Ramadi that's a thing that outshines all of it because of what you just described because of that feeling so so the sledgehammer for me I mean I will never forget the day on the ever forget June 20th ever the sledgehammer for me was the first day I got there the guy that I was replacing got in a humvee hit an ID he was woony buddy broke both of his legs in a humvee that I was supposed to take from him we were supposed to do the turnover of that humvee and obviously not getting that vehicle because it got blown up but it was a major in the Marine Corps and it was like majors and a major aviator in the Marine Corps got blown up by an ID so I got up to speed very quickly and that place had an ability to get you to be aware of the reality but very fast so I think I got there very fast day one something happened but the anticipation of that getting there that was kind of a sledgehammer for me what about reading reports when you're going in so I we talked about the last time my best friend was in Ramadi Neil and I think the power that is huge and it brought me right back to our last podcast which was you sitting right where you are reading cats letter to Chris and as it like I said like I had never heard it before it was it's a totally different level you know what podcasts was another podcast that sort of it got me was one soldier's war by arcadey and that part in the end of that podcast where it's again that was podcast number 18 it was it was a good solid deployment was there a risk sure there was risky wasn't super high risk I had had a great crew of guys but you know there was there was stress and there was personalities and you start to see that when you read about a guy and you think I kind of know that guy just I just know him a little bit I just know him a little bit yeah just like a draft just like a drafty and when when we see it in in leaders all the time they they present it like can't leave these people this is unsolvable problem it is a problem that the end we're we're going downhill it's supersonic speeds and when you do what you just said and turn it change that perspective and then put it in comparison to the story of the drafties they're almost a little embarrassed but when you read it it's maddening to think about that and you could see that like hack worth he didn't like that he didn't like that at all and that was all that was I think maybe it was you that told me when I had Jim Mucchiamon and or a couple people told me they were like you sounded giddy so then you guys always talking in context of business you know the boss and the support and that's whatever same exact thing with your wife same thing even though it feels like counter intuitive you know you're you you had all this stuff to do that you're doing for her by the way and you didn't take out the trash I don't know I'm not saying that happened to me not saying it didn't happen to me and so that's the first podcast where I said when I got done with it the next time I did a podcast that was heavy like that I knew that I had to get myself somewhere to go I had to give myself some thought about how am I gonna make this how does this become something I like I don't get out of this whole because that's what that's what you're doing and so there's a level of that as well when you hear like when you hear a hardcore history podcast you get a great storytelling oh no I knew all this at birth it's from these giant errors that we've made or giant mistakes where these giant realizations like I've been doing it wrong and everybody has to figure that out and that and that right there that is one of the most gratifying things about what we do now is that this gap that we talked about earlier this little gap between like how do you read something you read something and then how do you get that thing out of it how do you extract that vital piece of information that's in there how do you do that how do you tell look it looks like when you're kidding you don't listen to your parents so it's almost like you're getting worse you know if you do the math like now at level four out of a million you're like there you just like yesterday there was only four moves Yeah, and the language is different and if you just hear the words it sounds like a completely different world and then when you think about what he's saying I know exactly what you can you can feel what he's feeling and it comes through so so clearly and and I've read letters like that. and that's probably why if I look back in my career the thing that's the most powerful experience that I had that sort of outshines everything by so much is is that time in Rammadi because I was exposed to things that I never saw as a pilot and never would have seen had I not been on that deployment you know what I was thinking so one of the things I remember probably I don't know if it was 10 or 15 podcasts deep into into this podcast I remember saying during one of the podcasts and I've said it a few times along the way I remember saying that these people that I'm talking about in these books they're not characters two emphasize what you said that eyes opening that's a literal thing like they're not of metaphor you look at them and when you finally get it to click when you when their eyes actually open up and they sit up straight and they kind of sit back a little bit and there is a moment a physical moment are you recognize that they got it and when you see that and you can actually sit in an audience when you when you when you're talking to a group like maybe multiple leaders on the team and you're around a conference table and you're interacting and you bring up a particular example that they're dealing with you lay out the different possible scenarios and the one that is obviously the right one and they go yeah you said something that that jumped out of me a little bit you were you were just talking about you know is is is culture different it is something different so let me just say this a little bit because you know I've even thought a little bit about why do I see things differently than I used to what why have I evolved in a certain way so did I spent 23 years in the Marine Corps 23 years as a US Marine and a whole bunch of years just wanting to be a Marine I was in Ramadi for seven months but he's like going through the motions almost like like kind of kind of understanding you know yeah there's no way out so you got to execute when when leaders see the world like that when they see it that way they just work until the problem gets solved they just do everything they need to do until they find a way to fix the problem to solve it and when they don't think like that they I was describing dogfighting you know like dude that sounds exactly like jitz dude that's kind of what spark my interest was is there a way to kind of replicate those experiences that I had that I know I can't do an airplane anymore and so so there's his resume but it was really interesting so when he came on the podcast and we were talking about you know leadership and stuff like that and he gives this answer of we were talking around the subject of you know how do you get someone you know how do you get your people listen to you and we like you said that the disconnect of the impact of the human being that that that that's what leaders are supposed to do that's their job is to and Dickwinner's had that he talked about the idea of like hey when when somebody puts their head in their hands that's they live a physical that literally showing you hey man I'm breaking right now and the willingness to just say go do it again and then get to the point like I can't let go we're done with you we don't have anymore use for you and it's like man this is a lot different I'm in a humvy I can't see things I'm used to being able to see my situation awareness is different how I gather information all that is different because the environment is different the feeling the same in the response to the same and like I said I had the luxury if you want to call that I was always busy I was that stuff going on I had always things to do I never I didn't just sit there and think wow this is terrifying and scary well you basically went on a whole comment there about you know you got a your situation going back to the original subject here as a leader you're in this situation where you're going to take these guys that you care about and you're going to do everything to protect and you're regardless of how much you want to protect them they're you're gonna put them in situations where they can get killed and that that the new book coming out the first chapter is called the ultimate dichotomy it's what it's called it's the ultimate dichotomy and there's a reason because that is the ultimate dichotomy there's no that for a leader as far as I'm concerned that is the absolute hardest thing that you have to deal with as a leader right you got out of the Marine Corps and obviously we covered a little bit on the last podcast we covered about you know we didn't we kind of read the text last time you were on the podcast of kind of how the transition you know you got out you came to an event with Lafin Eye and we hung out and I also think that goes so you talk about love that that sort of that feeling of invincibility too when you're young and that like immune to not just the physical risks not just the potential of getting hurt or getting injured or getting shot or some of those worst things but the mental and emotional risks that go along with experiencing that that's a really hard lesson now the other side of that is you know when I deployed to Rammadi almost everybody on my team was a first deployment brand new young US Marine you met Marcus Perez he came to the the muster you know he was a young kid via nom they straight up don't believe in the war they just straight up don't believe in the war they're there against their will under threat of prison they show up there and these are the people you're in charge of and this is the answer I give all the time now for a moment when people ask me about millennia's people are like you know we we got millennials and they got a bad attitude I'm not afraid to say why I got that wrong I didn't see that coming this transition has been way way more than I thought it was going to be and in some ways it's actually put me on my heels a little bit it's been a reminder that man I'm not even close to doing the things that I want to do before I'm done I'm not even close and that's that's a hard feeling sometimes it's actually I struggle that a little bit because a lot of the times people around me tell me I've done great things and I hear that a lot and it's great to hear and so that's another part of it too there is an element when you read that's missing there's an element of voice that is just more powerful it's just more powerful and I remember when I read the forgotten highlander when I read that book I read it on the plane coming back calling a guy over in Scotland a buddy of mine who I done some work with he gave me this book and he I was on podcast 11 and he was hey you got to check on this book I won't try to do it Scottish accent plus he's a mumbler he's like he's gonna check up this book mate and you walk in there sort of with this kind of this bullet proof approach and it's not how it is when you leave it's not the same and and and in some ways like you said the scale is is different than a benapelilu or a guanoil or any of those things you know that that we just talked about but when it's happening to you it's it could be a single round a single mortar a single shot a single wound if it's happening to you it sort of feels like the it's happening to the whole world like oh I remember it's like for the landing on an aircraft carrier I'm going to be stressed out what I need to overcome that did you supply the same mechanisms to all right now I'm going to be stepping fruit on the battlefield and this is how I need to apply the same mentality the same mechanisms I had enough experience of being scared and controlling the fear that comes along with things that are scary that it looked different it smelled different it sounded different but you didn't take out the trash meanwhile you did literally from the moment you woke up to to that moment you got you know accused of whatever you did stuff for her right you couldn't done that hypothetically you hurt her saying hey you know you you didn't take out the trash all those feelings in your mind in your heart is to it's not to be like you're right it's just treated like people treat them like you treat anybody else and you know some of those fundamental lessons you know across leadership yeah the fact that you care about these guys it's your all you've been taught all you believe all you think all your your your morals and your values are all these for these guys that are doing anything for you and you'll do anything for them and you know their families and you know their kids and it's like and and I go hey man bro are you going to do something about this right here and and that was all he needed to hear all he needed to hear was like that guy that was in charge at all this training was telling me like was asking me a question he was questioning me and saying are you going to do something about this his eyes opened up and he said oh hell I don't want them to have is almost embarrassed and and even like you said Ramadi which for me which was sort of like the world series and the Super Bowl combined into one like the most powerful thing and with the old breed since we've been talking about that you talk about the battle of Okinawa and what they endured and then I read the book on the coldest war or colder than hell do they're like nothing like that like there is there is something that has happened and every one of the stories you've talked about or I think how is that possible and we'll say you gotta get the audio book because it's life and I reading it and you can hear I mean how much is communicated in the tone of voice there's a lot when you said earlier about the the audible piece of that when you finish my first podcast so when I was on uh this is we were talking about this almost a year and half ago now you know April I think of last year I guess you finished with a letter that cat wrote to Chris now I didn't know we hadn't discussed that and I talked about that there's no question that has been the most intriguing thing for me is that it's I'm able to replicate those feelings but the unlimited nature of how if a once out there if I had a guy in a hornet that I was going to do to be a femme with and he was we were going to do these this maneuvers and he'd be like I like to do this when I'm defensive and it wasn't exactly what he supposed to do he was going to lose every single time what they're really doing is taking things from other people that person they might get a couple of tactical victories along the way but in the end the person that puts everyone else first is going to win they are going to win so it's it's kind of hypocritical because it's like in one hand it's like and you ask you what would you like to have from your subordinates 100% of the people gonna go I want the guy that comes in and says hey is my fault I'm gonna fix it as a super obvious and then the very next question is why aren't you doing that with your boss why do you not think that your boss is having the same feeling as you would have with your subordinates and that recognition of everybody sees exactly what you're doing that's uncomfortable for people and I don't know if cultures different I don't know if our cultures different I don't know if we value human life more I don't know that and and they can take you down the wrong road if you got the wrong people but when you see it in other people and they treat you that way and that feeling of oh this guy this guy really cares about me this guy really is invested in me being successful in me having a good good life in a good career it's it's not hard to recognize like oh that that's how that's what I should do so obviously I'm like like I know what you're doing your bigger than your true ownership you know the Martinez brothers they had breakdowns in that a lot of the same stuff you know and that kind of went along with their style I would go so far as to say this is this is a guess I would go so far as to say that most people that have their black belt in juditsu or in the obsessed mode at some point in their life makes sense that's what I'm going to say sure I cannot disagree with that right if you ever known someone that's a black belt that was not at least for a period of three years was just that's all they thought about I don't know of any
