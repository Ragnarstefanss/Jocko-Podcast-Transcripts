00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.80
This is Jocko podcast number 359 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.80 --> 00:00:09.60
Jocko willing. Good evening Echo. Good evening. There was a

3
00:00:09.60 --> 00:00:14.000
loud burst of gunfire and Cowie fell to the ground exposed in

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.40
the street. He had taken around to his right femur. The barrage

5
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:21.60
of enemy gunfire continued to cascade toward him from multiple

6
00:00:21.60 --> 00:00:24.40
enemy positions kicking up dust and sending ricochet and

7
00:00:24.40 --> 00:00:29.04
secondary frag of rock and concrete right at him. Cowie

8
00:00:29.04 --> 00:00:32.16
immediately returned fire but was unable to move quickly to

9
00:00:32.16 --> 00:00:36.88
cover because of the grievous injury to his leg. Within

10
00:00:36.88 --> 00:00:40.56
seconds of hitting the ground, Cowie heard a new weapon enter

11
00:00:40.56 --> 00:00:46.64
the chaos. Michael Montsour, the automatic weapons gunner broke

12
00:00:46.64 --> 00:00:50.72
from his covered position in an adjacent courtyard into the

13
00:00:50.72 --> 00:00:53.60
middle of the street.

14
00:00:54.32 --> 00:00:58.16
In that same moment, Michael sent a long burst of 762

15
00:00:58.16 --> 00:01:02.24
millimeter rounds from his Mark 48 machine gun into enemy

16
00:01:02.24 --> 00:01:07.76
positions. Although carrying a heavy load of equipment, Michael

17
00:01:07.76 --> 00:01:12.48
definitely moved to where Cowie lay wounded and bleeding.

18
00:01:12.48 --> 00:01:16.24
He stood in front of him and used his lean frame and armor as a

19
00:01:16.24 --> 00:01:21.92
shield to protect Cowie from incoming enemy fire.

20
00:01:22.48 --> 00:01:26.24
This gave the wounded seal a reprieve he needed to continue to

21
00:01:26.24 --> 00:01:30.72
call for backup on his radio. Michael's technical acumen was

22
00:01:30.72 --> 00:01:33.84
apparent as he swiftly engaged and suppressed enemy

23
00:01:33.84 --> 00:01:40.24
positions with his Mark 48, effectively known as the pig.

24
00:01:40.24 --> 00:01:44.96
Every second and every round mattered. The other seal began to

25
00:01:44.96 --> 00:01:48.000
prepare Cowie to move while Michael engaged enemy

26
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.96
insurgents. Let's move the other seal shouted.

27
00:01:52.96 --> 00:01:56.72
Michael grabbed Cowie's drag handle on top of his armor and began to pull him

28
00:01:56.72 --> 00:02:02.08
back to the courtyard while still firing his Mark 48.

29
00:02:02.08 --> 00:02:05.36
Cowie looked up at Michael as he dragged him across the road

30
00:02:05.36 --> 00:02:10.32
but the perspective was not what he expected.

31
00:02:10.32 --> 00:02:16.80
Cowie felt as if for just a moment he had left his body below.

32
00:02:16.80 --> 00:02:22.16
He looked down upon the scene as Michael dragged him the snaps and

33
00:02:22.16 --> 00:02:26.56
ricochets of the heavy machine gun of enemy fire continued to hit the ground

34
00:02:26.56 --> 00:02:29.92
around them. Cowie couldn't believe that not one round

35
00:02:29.92 --> 00:02:36.64
had found its intended target. Instantly the light seemed to shift.

36
00:02:36.64 --> 00:02:43.60
Then Cowie saw them two large feathered wings wrapped from behind Michael

37
00:02:43.60 --> 00:02:48.08
around the trio as they moved him out of the street.

38
00:02:48.08 --> 00:02:54.32
Cowie knew in that instant they were not alone in the fight.

39
00:02:54.32 --> 00:02:58.08
Then Cowie was looking up at Michael again.

40
00:02:58.08 --> 00:03:01.36
He could feel the pain and hear the gunfire dust filled the air

41
00:03:01.36 --> 00:03:05.84
and the the sun beat down upon them as they moved.

42
00:03:05.84 --> 00:03:11.92
Once back behind cover the other seal began working on his injured teammate.

43
00:03:11.92 --> 00:03:15.12
The enemy fire picked up again just as Michael finished

44
00:03:15.12 --> 00:03:19.52
reloading. Michael answered with a heavy volley

45
00:03:19.52 --> 00:03:24.16
into the enemy position. JP and the rest of the squad along with their

46
00:03:24.16 --> 00:03:27.12
Iraqi partners joined the firefight minutes later.

47
00:03:27.12 --> 00:03:30.88
Lieutenant Seth Stone the officer in charge of Delta Platoon was deep into

48
00:03:30.88 --> 00:03:34.56
radio comms providing situation updates to the chain of command

49
00:03:34.56 --> 00:03:39.60
coordinating with units in other sectors and facilitating the movement

50
00:03:39.60 --> 00:03:46.16
of the responding soldiers, Marines and Iraqi partners into the fight.

51
00:03:49.84 --> 00:03:56.000
And that right there is an excerpt from a book that has just come out

52
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
which is entitled Defend Us in Battle the True Story of MA2 Navy Seal

53
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.60
Medal of Honor recipient Michael A. Monsour.

54
00:04:07.60 --> 00:04:12.000
And the book was written by Michael's father George Monsour along with

55
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.04
Rose Ray who is an author and is also the wife of a seal.

56
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:21.36
And the book was written by interviewing friends and family

57
00:04:21.36 --> 00:04:25.52
of Michael. Many of the members of Tasking a Bruiser

58
00:04:25.52 --> 00:04:30.72
shared their stories to paint a picture of Michael's bravery.

59
00:04:30.72 --> 00:04:34.56
His character is skilled as a seal.

60
00:04:34.56 --> 00:04:40.000
But of course Michael Monsour was much more than just a seal.

61
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.64
He was a man of compassion, of humor, of love, and of faith.

62
00:04:49.28 --> 00:04:52.24
He was the best.

63
00:04:52.48 --> 00:04:57.28
And he set an incredible example for all who knew him

64
00:04:57.28 --> 00:05:02.40
and for anyone that hears his story. And it's an honor

65
00:05:02.40 --> 00:05:08.80
to have Michael's dad George Monsour here with us tonight

66
00:05:08.80 --> 00:05:12.88
to share some of this incredible story with us.

67
00:05:12.88 --> 00:05:16.48
George, thanks for joining us tonight.

68
00:05:16.48 --> 00:05:21.92
Thanks for having me on. It's an honor to have you down here.

69
00:05:21.92 --> 00:05:27.52
I know it's not that far of a drive but I know it can be a little challenging

70
00:05:27.52 --> 00:05:30.08
sometimes.

71
00:05:30.08 --> 00:05:33.76
But glad you could make it down.

72
00:05:33.76 --> 00:05:37.20
I guess before we get, I guess we have to start at this story

73
00:05:37.20 --> 00:05:41.04
maybe at the beginning with a little bit about you and your background.

74
00:05:41.04 --> 00:05:45.12
So you're originally from Wisconsin, is that right?

75
00:05:45.12 --> 00:05:51.84
Yeah, I was born in La Crosse and my family came from

76
00:05:51.84 --> 00:05:58.32
Lebanon. So there was that transition. So are you first generation American or

77
00:05:58.32 --> 00:06:01.36
second generation? Yeah, it's like half. We're born half.

78
00:06:01.36 --> 00:06:06.72
So I was half of that family. There's like 10 kids.

79
00:06:06.72 --> 00:06:09.92
We're born here and half was born on the other side.

80
00:06:09.92 --> 00:06:15.44
So yeah, so there's a whole kind of a different world,

81
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:19.04
the Middle Eastern world and the American world. So

82
00:06:19.04 --> 00:06:23.52
yeah, there's things that are always a little different.

83
00:06:23.52 --> 00:06:27.92
And so how long did you stay in Wisconsin for?

84
00:06:27.92 --> 00:06:34.16
Not very long. I think they asked us to leave like the first year.

85
00:06:34.16 --> 00:06:39.04
You know, they told us to get out of Wisconsin.

86
00:06:39.04 --> 00:06:42.72
Went to California. And then it was California. So how old were you when you

87
00:06:42.72 --> 00:06:46.24
ended up in California? That's probably about one.

88
00:06:46.24 --> 00:06:53.04
And that's kind of where the rest of the family was born. I had

89
00:06:53.04 --> 00:07:01.20
two brothers and three sisters. My dad was in World War II and

90
00:07:01.20 --> 00:07:06.80
he had a lot of problems after the war. And he couldn't hold down the job.

91
00:07:06.80 --> 00:07:13.28
And he ended up just being a gambler. So we had kind of a, you know, I mean,

92
00:07:13.28 --> 00:07:19.20
we didn't realize it wasn't the best, but our family was close.

93
00:07:19.20 --> 00:07:25.44
And my mom basically was the one that kept everything together.

94
00:07:25.44 --> 00:07:32.32
And we didn't realize we were poor until somebody told me in school.

95
00:07:32.32 --> 00:07:36.64
And so then as you're growing up, you're growing up in California

96
00:07:36.64 --> 00:07:40.96
in like the 50s and 60s then. Yeah. That had to be pretty.

97
00:07:40.96 --> 00:07:45.04
Is it like, how does it compare with the movies?

98
00:07:45.04 --> 00:07:52.16
Well, we would watch these movies and our TV shows and you'd have

99
00:07:52.16 --> 00:07:58.16
Father Knows Bass and all these fathers are walking around with suits and ties.

100
00:07:58.16 --> 00:08:02.88
I look over at my dad. He's in his skib. He's reading the racing for him.

101
00:08:02.88 --> 00:08:07.20
The only thing he ever says to me is, beer me.

102
00:08:07.20 --> 00:08:10.56
So yeah, I would look at the TV and look at our family.

103
00:08:10.56 --> 00:08:16.96
Not quite the same. So you end up, I mean, you go to school.

104
00:08:16.96 --> 00:08:22.16
Where'd you go to high school? I went to St. John Bosco. It's a boy's school.

105
00:08:23.52 --> 00:08:27.60
I was fortunate that I was a pretty good football player. So it was a good fit.

106
00:08:28.56 --> 00:08:35.68
It was, it was, it was pretty tough. It was priest. These guys served in World War II

107
00:08:35.68 --> 00:08:40.24
and they didn't put up with a lot of nonsense and it was probably the best thing for me.

108
00:08:41.36 --> 00:08:44.16
They made it very clear what I could do and what I couldn't do.

109
00:08:45.28 --> 00:08:52.24
And then so you played football and what was your plan when you graduate, when you graduated?

110
00:08:52.24 --> 00:08:55.44
I mean, nowadays it's like everyone has to go to college, has to go to college.

111
00:08:55.44 --> 00:08:59.12
Did you have that plan or? Yeah, the plan was, because it was the

112
00:08:59.12 --> 00:09:02.88
college prep school, was to go to college, but it was an all-boy school.

113
00:09:02.88 --> 00:09:05.76
So my plan was different when I went to college.

114
00:09:07.60 --> 00:09:08.96
You had to make up for lost time?

115
00:09:10.40 --> 00:09:14.24
I was, anybody wanted to go in the back of my motorcycle? We're good.

116
00:09:15.04 --> 00:09:22.72
So I basically, my grades basically said to me, you're going to get drafted.

117
00:09:22.72 --> 00:09:26.88
So I decided to outsmart them and I joined the Marine Corps.

118
00:09:26.88 --> 00:09:35.28
Awesome. Yeah, you outsmarted them on that one.

119
00:09:36.08 --> 00:09:37.84
So what year was it that you joined the Marine Corps?

120
00:09:38.40 --> 00:09:41.28
68, I went from 68 to 72.

121
00:09:41.28 --> 00:09:47.44
So, I mean, when you, Vietnam is full blown in 1968 when you joined.

122
00:09:48.56 --> 00:09:50.72
Is it just known that you're going to Vietnam?

123
00:09:50.72 --> 00:09:56.72
Yeah, especially in my MOS, it wasn't the MOS I wanted.

124
00:09:57.68 --> 00:10:02.48
I was that guy that was always trying to stay out of the fray, you know, stay in the middle.

125
00:10:03.28 --> 00:10:11.12
But anyway, the problem was if your grades weren't good, then you'd go straight over as a grunt.

126
00:10:11.12 --> 00:10:15.92
I didn't want to be a grunt. So I kept my grades up.

127
00:10:15.92 --> 00:10:21.36
But the thing was, every time you did well in school, you got another school.

128
00:10:21.36 --> 00:10:26.56
I did well in the tests. I got aviation school. And then aviation school, I did well.

129
00:10:26.56 --> 00:10:30.72
And I got helicopters. Helicopters is not where you want to be in the Marine Corps.

130
00:10:32.40 --> 00:10:35.84
Even as you say, like, oh, I went to school for aviation.

131
00:10:35.84 --> 00:10:39.20
And like, that sounds like a, you know, okay, you're going to go load in this

132
00:10:39.20 --> 00:10:41.20
trailer, you're going to work on aircraft. Exactly.

133
00:10:41.20 --> 00:10:45.04
In Vietnam, that's a little bit different. It's a little bit of a different outcome.

134
00:10:45.04 --> 00:10:50.24
I got there and I says, hey, you know, this wasn't the deal. You know, when you sign up,

135
00:10:50.24 --> 00:10:54.72
they tell you one thing, but you don't always get what you want. And I certainly didn't.

136
00:10:54.72 --> 00:10:58.40
It was like, this wasn't the deal. And the guy goes, you'll have more schools.

137
00:10:58.40 --> 00:11:04.32
Don't worry about it. The last school I went to was machine gun, 50-cow machine gun school.

138
00:11:04.32 --> 00:11:08.000
That was it. What was the shock of boot camp like?

139
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:18.24
Like, actually, playing basketball, football wasn't, the boot camp wasn't a big deal.

140
00:11:19.36 --> 00:11:22.88
We had a coach that carried a baseball bat.

141
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.96
And I remember since it was a Catholic school, he told us why God gave his heads.

142
00:11:28.96 --> 00:11:34.88
And that was to punish the other players. And they had this bat and we had the cages and

143
00:11:34.88 --> 00:11:41.28
he would smack you in the head with the bat just so you understood what you're supposed to use

144
00:11:41.28 --> 00:11:50.24
your head for. And I remember we had a game, I think it was Venice, and we were just brutal.

145
00:11:50.24 --> 00:11:53.28
We weren't brutal on purposes. That's the way we were trained to hit.

146
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And the principal wrote a letter to the school after, you know, after the game, just trash.

147
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.92
We didn't cheat or anything. We played a straight game, but we laid people out.

148
00:12:07.36 --> 00:12:09.44
So, when he caught boot camp, it was perfectly fine.

149
00:12:09.44 --> 00:12:13.20
Yeah, it was fine. I had a couple of problems.

150
00:12:15.36 --> 00:12:21.44
Just understanding it, because I really, my family served World War II, Korean War.

151
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.32
And as you know, my sons all served in the Marine Corps other than Mike.

152
00:12:26.32 --> 00:12:34.72
But I didn't get it. I was like, I thought you go in and, you know, you get paid,

153
00:12:35.28 --> 00:12:42.000
I thought at least minimum wage, and all the military stuff. It just wasn't used to because

154
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.52
my father was definitely, you don't get a lot of discipline from a professional game.

155
00:12:48.24 --> 00:12:53.44
So, it was another world for me. The most discipline I got was at St. John Bosco.

156
00:12:53.44 --> 00:12:59.36
But I remember on payday, you go in, you get a little bit of money to get your soap and those

157
00:12:59.36 --> 00:13:06.64
type of things. And so they gave us instructions. They says, you go in there, you march in there,

158
00:13:06.64 --> 00:13:13.36
you make a right turn, then a left turn, then you send yourself in front of the CO's desk.

159
00:13:13.36 --> 00:13:18.08
He will push a book in front of you, you look down and look at that paybook,

160
00:13:18.08 --> 00:13:26.32
and you will say, the pay is correct, sir, and look straight ahead. So, I'm thinking, okay,

161
00:13:27.36 --> 00:13:34.64
I do it perfect. And I look down and I say, 36 dollars.

162
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:44.64
Where's your military buried? And I for 36 dollars.

163
00:13:47.36 --> 00:13:55.04
So, they finally got my attention and got me squared away. I was a private for quite a while.

164
00:13:58.24 --> 00:14:02.96
So, the last school you went to was 50 Cal School, but they sent you to the Hilo School.

165
00:14:02.96 --> 00:14:13.60
And then what year did you deploy to Vietnam? It was, I think it was 19. So, it was 69.

166
00:14:14.72 --> 00:14:20.64
And got back in, yeah, August 69, I think it was. I think it was August 69.

167
00:14:21.52 --> 00:14:27.04
And how was the deployment? How did you get over there? Did you take a charter aircraft over there?

168
00:14:27.04 --> 00:14:38.48
Yeah, we took a, I think it was a pan am. That was just a zoo. I mean, the officers were in front,

169
00:14:39.12 --> 00:14:45.44
and the snow peas were in the back. And you could just see it on those stewardship's faces,

170
00:14:45.44 --> 00:14:53.28
which one they wanted to be, the front or the back. It was a long flight and it was 16 hours.

171
00:14:53.28 --> 00:15:00.48
And we landed once for fuel in Hawaii, and they literally wouldn't let us get off.

172
00:15:00.48 --> 00:15:05.20
They had the guards out there. I'm thinking they pass the message to us or what.

173
00:15:05.84 --> 00:15:12.000
And then we finally got in and started sorting out where we were going to go. And I was really

174
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.48
fortunate in the long run because you know how this works, you just, you're a number and these

175
00:15:18.48 --> 00:15:24.000
guys will go here and these guys will go here. And I just skated through the whole deal. I ended up

176
00:15:24.72 --> 00:15:32.08
in only going there for just a little bit. And then I was simply at Okinawa most of the time.

177
00:15:32.64 --> 00:15:38.64
And I started feeling guilty because, you know, my friends were over there. And then when they

178
00:15:38.64 --> 00:15:46.96
were coming back, some big changes. And it really broke my heart. And I got, I feel so guilty.

179
00:15:46.96 --> 00:15:55.44
I was just there for a blank. So, you know how you're in this service and you just don't understand

180
00:15:55.44 --> 00:16:04.40
how certain things happen. You know, it's like how a close friend, you know, will go and or

181
00:16:04.40 --> 00:16:09.52
some of them come back and they just screwed up. And it reminded me of my dad. And that's why

182
00:16:10.16 --> 00:16:16.32
I didn't get my dad until I was in the Marine Corps. And I realized I would go to the hospital

183
00:16:16.32 --> 00:16:20.40
at Veterans Hospital when he was young and had these breakdowns. But I still couldn't get it

184
00:16:20.40 --> 00:16:26.08
through my head what was going on. Then after I saw the vets coming back in Okinawa where you're

185
00:16:26.08 --> 00:16:32.000
getting cleaned up, ready to go, you realize there's some guys that really got hit hard mentally

186
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.20
and physically too. But mentally is really something that just doesn't go away.

187
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.24
What did your, what did your dad do in World War II? Was he in the Army? Was he in the Marine Corps?

188
00:16:42.24 --> 00:16:48.88
My dad was, he's actually a super athlete. He was a Golden Glove champion. He was the

189
00:16:48.88 --> 00:16:54.64
Fleet Naval champion. And back then there was a lot of, that's where all the men were. But he was

190
00:16:54.64 --> 00:16:59.44
in the Navy and he was on, I don't know what they call them, like a pom-pom guns or something.

191
00:16:59.44 --> 00:17:08.64
They're on an air battleship and his job was to protect the aircraft or the planes on the aircraft

192
00:17:08.64 --> 00:17:17.92
carrier. And a friend of his was telling me, my dad would take it just bad if they hit those ships.

193
00:17:18.32 --> 00:17:24.96
He just thought it was, he had to get everyone. And he says that if they were taking fire he would

194
00:17:24.96 --> 00:17:34.40
stay right on that gun. So yeah, the films of the World War II, U.S. Navy, is, it's crazy to watch

195
00:17:34.40 --> 00:17:38.16
those things. It's crazy to watch those. And they have actually both sides. You know, they have the

196
00:17:38.16 --> 00:17:42.96
Japanese that are coming in and drop bombs. You can watch those films as well. Yeah. And he was

197
00:17:42.96 --> 00:17:50.64
in all the big ones, you know, the Midway and all that stuff. And so it just, it just mentally

198
00:17:50.64 --> 00:18:00.96
wiped them out. He would have these just, just go off on us. Yeah. It's, it's, I don't think we're

199
00:18:00.96 --> 00:18:08.72
ever going to have a naval war like World War II again, where it's, where the humans are at such a

200
00:18:08.72 --> 00:18:14.08
massive amount of pressure. I mean, of course, something the Navy can always go bad. I mean,

201
00:18:14.80 --> 00:18:21.20
if a vessel, I mean, you don't even need a war. You know, things can happen. But that World War II

202
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:27.52
from a naval war perspective is just, it's horrendous. I was talking with one of my friends

203
00:18:27.52 --> 00:18:33.84
the other day, even just being, even just firing those big guns, these guys didn't have hearing

204
00:18:33.84 --> 00:18:38.16
protection. You know, many, you know, and right now they're doing all these things with football

205
00:18:38.16 --> 00:18:47.20
and CTE and, and, uh, you know, traumatic brain injury, the TBI. They tell us now in the SEAL teams,

206
00:18:47.20 --> 00:18:53.52
we shoot these rockets, Carl Gustav Rockets and, and they're bit, they, they like rock you, you

207
00:18:53.52 --> 00:18:59.12
know, it's like you get, it's like you just got cracked in the head. And now they're, we used to

208
00:18:59.12 --> 00:19:02.56
just sit down as a range safety officer. We just sit there out there and shoot those things all day

209
00:19:02.56 --> 00:19:06.96
long. And now they're saying you can only shoot three a day and all this stuff. But can you imagine

210
00:19:06.96 --> 00:19:12.88
being like your dad on a, on a naval vessel with the, you're just getting concussion after concussion

211
00:19:12.88 --> 00:19:21.44
after concussion. It's ruthless, ruthless. It's, I don't think people understand how they just take

212
00:19:21.44 --> 00:19:30.56
it for granted. You know, you're 18, 19 years old and, um, or even the SEALs, uh, you guys are in a

213
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:37.36
firefight. And then next day you go into another one. You're looking at policemen who were in a

214
00:19:37.36 --> 00:19:44.96
firefight for a half hour and they retire, you know, and it's like these kids are out there

215
00:19:44.96 --> 00:19:50.96
and they just get up and do it and do it and do it. And my wife used to worry so much when we

216
00:19:50.96 --> 00:19:55.68
would have these ceremonies and she'd meet the SEALs. And she used to just think, how much are

217
00:19:55.68 --> 00:20:01.76
they carrying around? How much baggage are they carrying around? And, uh, it's just people just

218
00:20:01.76 --> 00:20:10.40
don't realize, um, how we can just, uh, wipe a guy out, have those memories come back and, uh,

219
00:20:10.40 --> 00:20:15.44
they just take it for granted. They, like you say, pros, they got this for them and that. And they

220
00:20:15.44 --> 00:20:21.92
got these young kids that are life and death situations carrying a hundred pounds on their back,

221
00:20:21.92 --> 00:20:25.84
a hundred and some degrees. And that's like to do it again the next day.

222
00:20:26.96 --> 00:20:32.48
And the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the, this country doesn't understand

223
00:20:33.20 --> 00:20:35.44
what these guys go through. They don't appreciate it.

224
00:20:38.08 --> 00:20:43.44
So you get done with Vietnam, your deployment to Vietnam, you come home and you're planning

225
00:20:43.44 --> 00:20:49.12
the whole time you're going to do your four years and punch out. Yeah. Uh, that was the plan. And

226
00:20:49.12 --> 00:20:56.16
it was funny. We were gone for 13 months and the world really goes fast. I remember, uh,

227
00:20:57.36 --> 00:21:02.56
my buddies were sitting in the car. We're going to go get some beer. I was, uh, I wasn't even

228
00:21:02.56 --> 00:21:10.96
old. I think I was 20. And, uh, anyway, I go in to get the beer. And, uh, so as I, as I go,

229
00:21:10.96 --> 00:21:15.76
leave, I stop and I go, Hey, wait a minute, I need a church key. And I go as a church key,

230
00:21:15.76 --> 00:21:22.32
a church key back then is what you used to open up. Okay. So yeah. So in the guys looking at me

231
00:21:22.32 --> 00:21:28.40
and he goes, you know, your church, how you open up the beer then. And he goes like this,

232
00:21:28.96 --> 00:21:32.80
pulls the beer out from under the, or soda from under the county. He goes like this. He goes,

233
00:21:32.80 --> 00:21:34.56
you go like this, you know,

234
00:21:34.56 --> 00:21:44.08
oh, so the new cans and come out. I go back to the car and, uh, and the guy, I go, check this out,

235
00:21:44.08 --> 00:21:53.04
guys. The guys go, whoa, where have we been? Yeah. I've had some guys on that were POWs in

236
00:21:53.04 --> 00:22:00.64
Vietnam and like you want, you know, these are guys that got shot down in like 1965, 1966, 1967,

237
00:22:00.64 --> 00:22:09.76
they come back in 1973. It is a whole new world. I mean, it was a whole new world for them.

238
00:22:10.64 --> 00:22:17.28
And even the year, like, I mean, you must be gone 69. That the world changed a lot in that year.

239
00:22:17.28 --> 00:22:23.12
Oh yeah. I mean, uh, we got back, they really hated us. I was stunned. How many people hated us.

240
00:22:23.12 --> 00:22:32.64
And, uh, I'm thinking, what did we do? It was come out and insult us. Uh, you know, I remember, uh,

241
00:22:32.64 --> 00:22:38.56
uh, I was at the airport and back then you had to fly on your uniforms and, uh, it was not a good

242
00:22:38.56 --> 00:22:44.64
idea all the time. You were like targets. And I had a woman is up in San Francisco, just rush up to

243
00:22:44.64 --> 00:22:51.84
me and she's got her children and she just hates me and I don't even know her. And, uh, she says,

244
00:22:51.84 --> 00:22:57.84
she says, she says, how do you kill babies? And it's like, and I started thinking, why should I

245
00:22:57.84 --> 00:23:03.36
take her seriously? It's like, well, we try to give them a little bit more lead, you know, because

246
00:23:03.36 --> 00:23:09.84
they're quick. I'm sure she appreciated it. Oh, she didn't appreciate it. But you know, it's like,

247
00:23:09.84 --> 00:23:16.72
how long do we keep taking it? Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, they, uh, it was, it was weird the way they

248
00:23:16.72 --> 00:23:24.72
treated us, uh, Virginia, I think they had signs dogs and Marines stay off the grass. And I thought,

249
00:23:24.72 --> 00:23:30.96
when are we going to learn this lesson that these guys are called and now they volunteer to do

250
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:35.76
something that nobody else wants to do. Now they're treating them a lot better, which I totally

251
00:23:35.76 --> 00:23:40.16
appreciate. No, they're definitely, it's definitely a different world for us coming home now.

252
00:23:40.16 --> 00:23:50.80
Yeah. So what'd you do when you got, what'd you do when you got out? Uh, I was totally drifting.

253
00:23:54.24 --> 00:23:59.44
I knew I wanted, I wanted to start a business, but I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to.

254
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.68
I, when I was younger, I was learning the contracting business. I was like a human

255
00:24:05.68 --> 00:24:12.16
wheelbarrow, you know, I just, whatever they wanted loaded up. That's what I would do. So I got into

256
00:24:12.16 --> 00:24:22.000
contracting and, uh, then went to school at night and built a business. Uh, we did, I had a partner

257
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.88
that I went with ever since elementary school. So, uh, we built it up to about 60 guys. And then

258
00:24:28.88 --> 00:24:37.60
from there I bought a, uh, a woman's store for my sister, uh, who went through a divorce and, uh,

259
00:24:38.40 --> 00:24:43.68
figured she needed an income up about a store for, they really didn't make enough money. So I ended

260
00:24:43.68 --> 00:24:52.24
up with, um, uh, uh, four stores in the department in the malls. And then I decided I would, um,

261
00:24:52.24 --> 00:24:59.44
um, uh, start manufacturing clothes. So it just kind of worked that way. And then, uh, I got a,

262
00:24:59.44 --> 00:25:06.88
a 300 seat restaurant bar entertainment and, uh, everything, uh, was working just great.

263
00:25:06.88 --> 00:25:11.68
Moving in a nice house, had the kids, wife's happy. So you, what year do you meet? Howie?

264
00:25:11.68 --> 00:25:22.08
I met her before I, uh, I, uh, I went overseas. Okay. I, she was a, uh, car hop.

265
00:25:24.16 --> 00:25:30.72
I remember, uh, watching her and, uh, I just love the way she looked in those slacks.

266
00:25:32.24 --> 00:25:41.04
What's a car hop? A car hop is, uh, you, at, back in the day, uh, you would pull up into,

267
00:25:41.04 --> 00:25:45.36
at a restaurant in the parking lot and the girls would come out and have little cowboy

268
00:25:45.36 --> 00:25:50.96
hats on and stuff. And they had the menu. So you eat right in your car. And this is where a lot

269
00:25:50.96 --> 00:25:55.92
of the young guys would hang out, um, hang out in their cars and go out and check everybody's

270
00:25:55.92 --> 00:26:02.08
cars. And, you know, it was just a real social thing. And I remember, uh, she bends down to

271
00:26:02.08 --> 00:26:08.88
take the order and I see her face and it was just weird. It was like, um, she had her front teeth

272
00:26:08.88 --> 00:26:14.56
or just kind of turned in a little bit and it just, I don't know. I just loved her face.

273
00:26:15.28 --> 00:26:21.04
And, uh, we knew each other for five years, uh, on and off on and off. When I came back,

274
00:26:21.68 --> 00:26:28.48
uh, she was engaged to get married, but it was my fault because I thought that I was going to

275
00:26:28.48 --> 00:26:34.96
go to Vietnam and the life expectancy was not good, uh, sitting behind a 50 Kallin in a helicopter.

276
00:26:34.96 --> 00:26:40.40
So I didn't want her to waste her time. So I says, you know, uh, why don't you go ahead and see

277
00:26:40.40 --> 00:26:47.92
other people? You know, I am, you know, so, you know, good luck. And I come back and I find out she's engaged to get married.

278
00:26:47.92 --> 00:26:58.64
And then I bumped into her at a party and, uh, they just started over again. It was nice.

279
00:26:58.64 --> 00:27:02.96
And, uh, so she broke off the engagement. Yeah. Yeah. Nicely done, George.

280
00:27:02.96 --> 00:27:07.28
I've apologized to her for years. I'm so sorry.

281
00:27:09.36 --> 00:27:13.76
Okay. So you had, you're just basically an entrepreneur. You got restaurants,

282
00:27:13.76 --> 00:27:18.64
you got clothing manufacturing, you got a contract, you got all kinds of stuff going on.

283
00:27:18.64 --> 00:27:23.44
Yeah. And, uh, we had a couple of race horses, which was, uh, it was a lot of fun.

284
00:27:24.24 --> 00:27:27.04
And, uh, it was, it was good. And, uh,

285
00:27:27.04 --> 00:27:35.12
So you had Sarah first Sarah and, uh, then we had Jim and then, uh, Michael and then Joe.

286
00:27:35.76 --> 00:27:37.12
Joe, we almost had in the car.

287
00:27:41.12 --> 00:27:48.56
That was funny. I got to the hospital and, uh, the emergency side, it was at, uh,

288
00:27:48.56 --> 00:27:56.40
it was at Long Beach Memorial. And at that time you had to park on a slope and I just pulled the car up and,

289
00:27:56.40 --> 00:28:03.76
uh, and I ran into the hospital and I said, my wife's having a baby. Get ready. And I grabbed a wheelchair and I go out there.

290
00:28:04.16 --> 00:28:12.16
And because they were on the slope, I'm trying to get her out and the door keeps closing. And then, uh, so I kind of moved myself around.

291
00:28:12.40 --> 00:28:21.04
And then I got my hand on the, on the wheelchair and I finally get her in and she sits back and then the weight pushes the wheelchair back,

292
00:28:21.04 --> 00:28:32.40
pushes my hand. My hand is now, uh, right there down onto the asphalt. And, uh, I'm trying to, uh, get her back up so I can get my hand out.

293
00:28:32.40 --> 00:28:40.000
But it all worked out. We got her in there as soon as we got her up to the, uh, into the elevator. They were right there. They took her and

294
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.84
they told me to change my clothes. I ran in and Joe was already born.

295
00:28:43.84 --> 00:28:52.96
Uh, um, I want to read a section here from the book, uh, when, when Michael was born.

296
00:28:53.68 --> 00:29:02.40
Um, you say this in the book, as they gazed upon their second son in the bright hospital room with his inquisitive brown eyes looking right back at

297
00:29:02.40 --> 00:29:10.16
theirs, his matted dark hair contrasting his fresh soft skin. George knew Michael was the right name for him.

298
00:29:10.16 --> 00:29:22.80
Sally wholeheartedly agreed. He was named after St. Michael, the archangel who in the Old Testament cast out of heaven, all of the fallen angels led by Lucifer and condemn them to eternity in hell.

299
00:29:23.68 --> 00:29:32.08
He was a soldier full of strength and feared nothing. It was a perfect fit. The hospital staff performed their newborn well checks on little Michael.

300
00:29:32.56 --> 00:29:39.92
And after some time had passed, the pediatrician walked into their room. Mrs. Montsour, Michael has jaundice, which is why his skin

301
00:29:39.92 --> 00:29:53.04
has a yellowish tint. It's caused by an excess of pigment. Typically because of obstruction of the bile duct, you will be discharged today, but we will need to keep Michael and put him in an incubator until his levels get lower.

302
00:29:53.84 --> 00:30:01.04
Sally looked back at the doctor. She'd heard what he was telling her, but before she could help herself, she blurted out, doctor, I'm not leaving my son.

303
00:30:01.36 --> 00:30:07.52
That was Sally. The pediatrician fought for a few minutes as he could see the unwavering determination in her eyes.

304
00:30:07.52 --> 00:30:19.76
And that she was adamant about not leaving him. Well, Mrs. Montsour, we'll let you take him home, but you have to agree to set a protocol of treatment in the home, including sitting with him by the window in the sun for two to three hours a day.

305
00:30:19.76 --> 00:30:30.24
If you follow our instructions and he continues to improve, he will not need to stay or come back to the hospital. Thank you so much. I will. I will do everything you need. Sally replied.

306
00:30:30.24 --> 00:30:49.20
So there's, there's Mikey arrives on the scene and he ends up having asthma too. Yeah, it just, it was like from day one, Mikey, Mikey's was like always had a problem and got through that and his skin got better.

307
00:30:49.20 --> 00:31:06.96
And then as he got a little bit older, we realized he was having breathing problems. And then we found out he had asthma, but being Mikey, it wasn't, it's never just a little bit. I mean, it's always full blown and it was rough for years.

308
00:31:06.96 --> 00:31:08.08
Like the asthma?

309
00:31:08.08 --> 00:31:30.08
Yeah, I mean, we would check on him every night, fearful that he would stop breathing. And he, you know, he just, it was just so small and so weak because he really couldn't exert himself. He's looking at his, his brothers and his sisters, our sister, and they're just excelling.

310
00:31:30.08 --> 00:31:49.76
And he's just trying to keep up. They would race in the pool and people are thinking they're swimming, but no, Mikey couldn't swim because he would get so exhausted moving all those body parts. So he would race them by hand over hand along the side of the pool.

311
00:31:49.76 --> 00:31:56.72
He would always compete. He would just find a different way to compete.

312
00:31:56.72 --> 00:32:08.72
And again, look, this book is Defend Us in Battle. It's, it's just an outstanding book. I'm reading small chunks of it, but the stories are just fantastic to read.

313
00:32:08.72 --> 00:32:14.72
This one, I must admit, I felt like I had to read, I had to read this one here. It says,

314
00:32:14.72 --> 00:32:27.72
As he grew older, Michael was often the target of bullying at school as well as on the playground and began to hate it. He felt profoundly for himself, the effects of someone victimizing someone less able to defend themselves in order for them to gratify their own desires.

315
00:32:27.72 --> 00:32:40.72
Even in his youngest years, he was keenly aware of the injustice that took place. One afternoon when Michael was around nine or 10, his father took him to the racetrack to scout out some future horse prospects as their family raced at thoroughbreds at the time.

316
00:32:40.72 --> 00:32:45.72
When they arrived, George began to chat with the trainer and Michael ran off to play on the play sec campground.

317
00:32:45.72 --> 00:32:56.72
As he played with the other children, George noticed three older boys pushing the other children or children around, including Michael. They made a show of it in an effort to demonstrate to all the children that they were in charge.

318
00:32:56.72 --> 00:33:06.72
They took over, they took over the only three swings and refused to get off any of them for the smaller and younger children to use. Not your swing, it's mine now.

319
00:33:06.72 --> 00:33:14.72
They taunted the younger kids. George called Michael back to him and looked at his tears, tear filled eyes.

320
00:33:14.72 --> 00:33:20.72
Come here, Mikey. I know those kids are being bullies, but not every wrong is yours to write.

321
00:33:20.72 --> 00:33:25.72
There's not always justice in the world. Sometimes you just have to move on, George told Michael.

322
00:33:25.72 --> 00:33:31.72
Dad, what is justice? Michael asked, his curiosity perked on hearing the new word.

323
00:33:31.72 --> 00:33:36.72
Justice is getting or giving what is deserved, whether it's reward or punishment.

324
00:33:36.72 --> 00:33:41.72
Mikey, George responded to his son, whom he always called Mikey when it was just the two of them.

325
00:33:41.72 --> 00:33:51.72
George could see his son taking in his words, yet his son's question continued to cut through his thoughts as they headed to their seats to watch the horse race.

326
00:33:51.72 --> 00:33:59.72
He could see in Michael's eyes that the issue was not resolved. After the action packed race, they returned to the area where they met the trainer.

327
00:33:59.72 --> 00:34:03.72
George asked Michael to stay nearby him and wait for him.

328
00:34:03.72 --> 00:34:08.72
But as soon as George was speaking with the trainer, Michael shot off to the playground with fire in his eyes.

329
00:34:08.72 --> 00:34:12.72
Those same boys were again back on the swings taunting the younger children.

330
00:34:12.72 --> 00:34:18.72
Michael ran straight up to them from behind and ripped each boy out of their swing one at a time.

331
00:34:18.72 --> 00:34:25.72
He then sprinted up the play structure and began to climb the ladder that led up to the rocket ship that had multiple layers of slides and ladders.

332
00:34:25.72 --> 00:34:36.72
He knew if he could get to the top, only one bully could get to him at a time and sure enough, they chased him right up after and one by one, he kicked each boy backwards over and over as they tried to attack him.

333
00:34:36.72 --> 00:34:43.72
When he could no longer defend himself, he initiated his escape plan. He leaped through the top rocket opening down the slide and ran as fast as he possibly could back to his father.

334
00:34:43.72 --> 00:34:53.72
This time, with the biggest grin on his face and eyes sparkling with excitement, he knew he was safe with his father by his side and it executed his plan perfectly.

335
00:34:53.72 --> 00:35:02.72
George and Michael got into their car to head back home and George glanced across at his son who sat in the passenger seat, victoriously grinning back at him.

336
00:35:02.72 --> 00:35:06.72
Dad, I think that's justice.

337
00:35:06.72 --> 00:35:29.72
When I was looking at him smiling, I was thinking who was smiling the most because it was just a special day for me and I know he felt so good that he outsmarted the bullies and that was just the beginning on him and bullies.

338
00:35:29.72 --> 00:35:37.72
Yeah, that was like a sly move. That was the thing about Mikey is he was quiet, but you could tell he was plotting.

339
00:35:37.72 --> 00:35:38.72
He was.

340
00:35:38.72 --> 00:35:43.72
He was plotting. So that was like the beginning of him plotting moves.

341
00:35:43.72 --> 00:35:47.72
Trying to figure something out.

342
00:35:47.72 --> 00:35:56.72
So you were doing good. Going back to just family businesses, all this stuff going on. You live in Anaheim Hills, which is a nice spot.

343
00:35:56.72 --> 00:35:58.72
Nice view of the city.

344
00:35:58.72 --> 00:36:00.72
And then economy hit.

345
00:36:00.72 --> 00:36:04.72
Economy and the IRS.

346
00:36:04.72 --> 00:36:05.72
Ouch.

347
00:36:05.72 --> 00:36:21.72
And the IRS, back then, before George Bush Sr., they were, they had carte blanche. They did what they wanted and they would accuse you of something and too bad.

348
00:36:21.72 --> 00:36:23.72
You had to abide by it.

349
00:36:23.72 --> 00:36:29.72
I didn't owe them any money and so I fought and it was an eight year battle.

350
00:36:29.72 --> 00:36:39.72
But that battle really wiped me out and I won. I got a little piece of paper that says George Montser versus the IRS, pay nothing.

351
00:36:39.72 --> 00:36:43.72
I might have been better off just to write them a check.

352
00:36:43.72 --> 00:36:48.72
But I was young. I think I was 30 or something, 31.

353
00:36:48.72 --> 00:36:56.72
And so I just, you know, that's wrong and I'm going to fight for it and maybe I should have negotiated.

354
00:36:56.72 --> 00:37:09.72
But that kind of money, $600 plus penalties like $800,000. Back in the 70s, you're talking about buying seven or eight million dollar houses in today's market.

355
00:37:09.72 --> 00:37:10.72
Yeah.

356
00:37:10.72 --> 00:37:22.72
So anyway, I fought and then it really crushed us business wise and it was, it was amazing really how strong our family was.

357
00:37:22.72 --> 00:37:33.72
Because we went from a pretty nice life to me coming home one day after the banks called me and said, I have been gutted and I had $29 in my pocket.

358
00:37:33.72 --> 00:37:44.72
And it was kind of struck me as like, I thought I'd feel bad about it, but it was, it was just the money was gone.

359
00:37:44.72 --> 00:37:49.72
I still had my family and just work around it.

360
00:37:49.72 --> 00:37:53.72
And I took, I went, my income definitely changed.

361
00:37:53.72 --> 00:38:03.72
Got a job working as a security guard and I took the job because they paid every Friday and I wanted to make sure my kids had groceries.

362
00:38:03.72 --> 00:38:09.72
And so I just did that until I put some deals together and it took a while.

363
00:38:09.72 --> 00:38:13.72
And you moved from Anaheim Hills down to, just when you moved down to Garden Grove?

364
00:38:13.72 --> 00:38:18.72
Yeah. And this area wasn't, wasn't the best.

365
00:38:18.72 --> 00:38:26.72
But it was a good experience for my kids and because they would see it when they had come to the factory with me.

366
00:38:26.72 --> 00:38:30.72
Factory was down in LA and that was pretty rough area.

367
00:38:30.72 --> 00:38:32.72
And they would see looking out the window.

368
00:38:32.72 --> 00:38:35.72
It's, you know, some of these people had it really tough.

369
00:38:35.72 --> 00:38:46.72
And we used to have a bear of a man that would sleep in front of our, in front of the door on the porch every night.

370
00:38:46.72 --> 00:38:50.72
And he would, he wouldn't say anything to me.

371
00:38:50.72 --> 00:38:54.72
It was more of a grunt all the time and he probably had some mental problems.

372
00:38:54.72 --> 00:38:59.72
He was just a huge guy and I asked him, I says, are you sleeping here every night?

373
00:38:59.72 --> 00:39:01.72
And it was just a kind of a grunt.

374
00:39:01.72 --> 00:39:02.72
Was this of your house?

375
00:39:02.72 --> 00:39:05.72
No, this was at the factory and down in LA.

376
00:39:05.72 --> 00:39:12.72
And so I thought to myself, a guy that big, I got no problem with them sleeping here at night because it was a rough area.

377
00:39:12.72 --> 00:39:18.72
So I put blankets out for him and he stayed there for years.

378
00:39:18.72 --> 00:39:22.72
Every morning I would come in, bring him a big breakfast burrito.

379
00:39:22.72 --> 00:39:29.72
He still hardly say anything to grunts and he would roll up his blankets and disappear all day.

380
00:39:29.72 --> 00:39:31.72
And then in the evening he'd come back.

381
00:39:31.72 --> 00:39:34.72
And the kids were fascinated with the sky.

382
00:39:34.72 --> 00:39:36.72
They wanted to be his friend, but he wasn't buying it.

383
00:39:36.72 --> 00:39:39.72
But anyway, they kind of saw that world.

384
00:39:39.72 --> 00:39:47.72
Now we're in an area where it's just a little bit of everything, a sprinkling of all kinds of nationalities.

385
00:39:47.72 --> 00:39:59.72
It was a lower income area and the kids were like, from a nice high school with all their friends are wealthy.

386
00:39:59.72 --> 00:40:05.72
They all go to Europe and all that stuff, which I didn't really like them around those kids all the time

387
00:40:05.72 --> 00:40:09.72
because I didn't want them to think this is the way it is.

388
00:40:09.72 --> 00:40:11.72
I wanted to see the other side.

389
00:40:11.72 --> 00:40:13.72
So it was a good experience.

390
00:40:13.72 --> 00:40:16.72
You've met my kids, you know they're good with whoever.

391
00:40:16.72 --> 00:40:17.72
100%.

392
00:40:17.72 --> 00:40:20.72
They just roll with whatever and the whole family's that way.

393
00:40:20.72 --> 00:40:23.72
So it was good for them.

394
00:40:23.72 --> 00:40:25.72
Sarah wasn't thrilled with it.

395
00:40:25.72 --> 00:40:28.72
Sorry Sarah.

396
00:40:28.72 --> 00:40:36.72
She ended up being a leader on the basketball team and all the kids to grade in sports.

397
00:40:36.72 --> 00:40:41.72
And all in all, I think it was one of the best things that happened.

398
00:40:41.72 --> 00:40:52.72
Well, we've got a, I guess it's some kind of mythological thing in my family that started with when I was growing up at Christmas time.

399
00:40:52.72 --> 00:40:59.72
Apparently my mother's dad, when Christmas would be coming, he would tell everyone it's going to be a lean Christmas.

400
00:40:59.72 --> 00:41:05.72
And so that's what my parents would tell us like, hey, it's going to be a lean Christmas.

401
00:41:05.72 --> 00:41:11.72
And then you know when I was raising my kids and I'm in the Navy and I, you know, I got three kids then four kids.

402
00:41:11.72 --> 00:41:12.72
I didn't have any money.

403
00:41:12.72 --> 00:41:16.72
I've been telling my kids it's going to be a lean Christmas.

404
00:41:16.72 --> 00:41:20.72
And you know, we get like, I remember, you know, we get used presents.

405
00:41:20.72 --> 00:41:26.72
And I mean, I got my, my kids got used presents all the time, used surfboards, used toys.

406
00:41:26.72 --> 00:41:30.72
Everything was just used because it's going to be a lean Christmas.

407
00:41:30.72 --> 00:41:37.72
But you got a story that might that when you moved down, I think it might have been the first Christmas down the garden Grove where you guys didn't have money.

408
00:41:37.72 --> 00:41:46.72
You were looking at a lean Christmas and you got a story here about Mikey who goes out and I think he cut down like you didn't have a Christmas tree.

409
00:41:46.72 --> 00:41:48.72
The deal was you guys were going to do no presents.

410
00:41:48.72 --> 00:41:58.72
We were just going to have a nice dinner and we, we just started to get back on our feet and I had to deal fall apart on me at Christmas.

411
00:41:58.72 --> 00:42:02.72
And so my money's tied up and I can't get it out.

412
00:42:02.72 --> 00:42:10.72
And I just said, look, we just moved into a house still in Garden Grove, but it was quite a step up.

413
00:42:10.72 --> 00:42:14.72
And Michael is one of those guys.

414
00:42:14.72 --> 00:42:17.72
He, he just kind of, okay.

415
00:42:17.72 --> 00:42:18.72
He's plotting.

416
00:42:18.72 --> 00:42:19.72
He's plotting.

417
00:42:19.72 --> 00:42:35.72
And so we wake up and we walk out and there's this Italian Cyprus sitting in a bucket of dirt and you put a little sparkly things on there.

418
00:42:35.72 --> 00:42:44.72
There might even been some lights up and there's a little present surrounded and we're all coming in, you know, sit down, sit down, you know.

419
00:42:44.72 --> 00:42:50.72
And he's giving us presents and the presents were hilarious.

420
00:42:50.72 --> 00:42:53.72
I still have the rocks he gave me.

421
00:42:53.72 --> 00:43:05.72
Sally kept the scarf that he got with those throwaways at the racetrack and the kids got like fingernail clippers or little knives and we just roared.

422
00:43:05.72 --> 00:43:13.72
It was just so funny and the way he presented them, you know, and you're looking at your kids and you're thinking,

423
00:43:13.72 --> 00:43:23.72
these are strong kids, you know, they get it and they just roll with with the disappointments, but it was a great Christmas.

424
00:43:23.72 --> 00:43:31.72
And then I remember when we were leaving the house, I don't know where we're going to go, but go out and I look at the car and you look in the front of the house.

425
00:43:31.72 --> 00:43:34.72
And it's that Cyprus.

426
00:43:34.72 --> 00:43:42.72
So you get two Cyprus on one side, you got a Cyprus, the half on the other.

427
00:43:42.72 --> 00:43:49.72
Cyprus, you know, you get your your kids and your neighbors are thinking, they're ever going to fix that.

428
00:43:49.72 --> 00:43:51.72
You know, no, it's a memory.

429
00:43:51.72 --> 00:43:56.72
I think it wasn't fixed in till somebody else bought the house.

430
00:43:56.72 --> 00:44:00.72
And so everyone's playing sports.

431
00:44:00.72 --> 00:44:02.72
Mikey and I playing hockey.

432
00:44:02.72 --> 00:44:03.72
How do you get into hockey?

433
00:44:03.72 --> 00:44:05.72
That's not the Southern California sport.

434
00:44:05.72 --> 00:44:10.52
Anything that rolls or slides, it was just him.

435
00:44:10.52 --> 00:44:11.52
I don't know.

436
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:15.28
He was like, I remember the first time he was on skates, it was like, I'm looking at

437
00:44:15.28 --> 00:44:18.36
this guy, he's jumping over stuff.

438
00:44:18.36 --> 00:44:22.92
Once he starts moving, it's like in his head, well, maybe I can do this, maybe I can do

439
00:44:22.92 --> 00:44:23.92
this.

440
00:44:23.92 --> 00:44:26.20
It's like when we got him a bike.

441
00:44:26.20 --> 00:44:30.04
Next thing he's building ramps, you know, so you know, high he can go.

442
00:44:30.04 --> 00:44:32.20
Ramps break, he crashes and burns.

443
00:44:32.20 --> 00:44:35.80
He gets right back, builds another ramp.

444
00:44:35.80 --> 00:44:41.48
And hockey, yeah, it surprised me, but he was still smaller than the other kids.

445
00:44:41.48 --> 00:44:47.32
And his edge was really how fast he was on wheels.

446
00:44:47.32 --> 00:44:49.12
And he just really liked the sport.

447
00:44:49.12 --> 00:44:55.96
He got his contact, but because he was on wheels, he could really hit these guys too, and he

448
00:44:55.96 --> 00:44:57.28
was quick.

449
00:44:57.28 --> 00:45:02.28
So if they hit him, he could come back and he felt everything was equal.

450
00:45:02.28 --> 00:45:05.24
And he loved the game, yeah.

451
00:45:05.24 --> 00:45:07.52
And then he also played football as well.

452
00:45:07.52 --> 00:45:13.92
Yeah, he loved football, but he was, you know, he just, he wasn't a big guy, but he had,

453
00:45:13.92 --> 00:45:18.000
you know, he's one of those guys had a lot of heart, always working.

454
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.68
And he took it really serious.

455
00:45:19.68 --> 00:45:22.000
No one was going to run past him.

456
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.92
He was the defensive end.

457
00:45:23.92 --> 00:45:26.000
And that was his territory.

458
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.28
Even if he had to pull the guy's face mask, he was not going to go any place.

459
00:45:31.28 --> 00:45:36.12
I remember he did it and he's double teamed and I see his head reach out, grabs the guy's

460
00:45:36.12 --> 00:45:37.12
face mask.

461
00:45:37.12 --> 00:45:42.68
And I was sitting just right off in the bleachers, he could see me and he looks at me like, you

462
00:45:42.68 --> 00:45:44.96
got to do what you got to do.

463
00:45:44.96 --> 00:45:45.96
Not on my side.

464
00:45:45.96 --> 00:45:48.24
You've got a section in here.

465
00:45:48.24 --> 00:45:51.96
You say Michael's team was getting pummeled by their counterpart junior varsity team,

466
00:45:51.96 --> 00:45:54.20
which included some of the varsity players.

467
00:45:54.20 --> 00:45:58.32
One by one, the JV players on his team began to remove their helmets and quit walking off

468
00:45:58.32 --> 00:46:00.12
the field and defeat and shame.

469
00:46:00.12 --> 00:46:03.40
They were not willing to be humiliated any longer in front of their family or friends

470
00:46:03.40 --> 00:46:05.76
during the guard group football scrimmage.

471
00:46:05.76 --> 00:46:11.48
The clock sounded its horn loud horn for half time and each team jog to the respective

472
00:46:11.48 --> 00:46:17.04
locker rooms as George sat by his old 64 gold Riviera.

473
00:46:17.04 --> 00:46:19.04
I love that car.

474
00:46:19.04 --> 00:46:22.56
Michael ended up with it for a while and waited for the game to resume.

475
00:46:22.56 --> 00:46:26.20
Michael walked past his father with barely a glance in his direction.

476
00:46:26.20 --> 00:46:29.000
George watched curiously as Michael moved around the front of the car and opened the

477
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.84
passenger door to get in.

478
00:46:30.84 --> 00:46:34.04
George confused as to why Michael was not headed back to the field, looked directly

479
00:46:34.04 --> 00:46:35.04
at him.

480
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:36.04
What happened, Mikey?

481
00:46:36.04 --> 00:46:37.04
Why are you here?

482
00:46:37.04 --> 00:46:40.56
Michael looked up at his father, his whole demeanor ripe with disappointment as he fought

483
00:46:40.56 --> 00:46:41.56
back tears.

484
00:46:41.56 --> 00:46:43.04
Dad, they just quit.

485
00:46:43.04 --> 00:46:45.92
The referee canceled the game because too many of our players quit.

486
00:46:45.92 --> 00:46:47.60
Dad, why would they quit?

487
00:46:47.60 --> 00:46:48.72
We still had a chance.

488
00:46:48.72 --> 00:46:49.72
We could have won.

489
00:46:49.72 --> 00:46:52.44
Mikey, you guys were down by 50 points.

490
00:46:52.44 --> 00:46:54.08
I know, Dad, but the game wasn't over yet.

491
00:46:54.08 --> 00:46:55.32
We had a chance.

492
00:46:55.32 --> 00:46:59.88
He hung his head trying to fathom what had just transpired as he quietly repeated to

493
00:46:59.88 --> 00:47:00.88
himself.

494
00:47:00.88 --> 00:47:01.88
They just quit.

495
00:47:01.88 --> 00:47:03.96
Quitting was not something the Montsourges did.

496
00:47:03.96 --> 00:47:07.000
They were always taught to follow through.

497
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.16
Yeah, we were.

498
00:47:09.16 --> 00:47:14.64
I mean, I had, when they wanted to play a sport, before I put them in that sport, we always

499
00:47:14.64 --> 00:47:16.80
had the same conversation.

500
00:47:16.80 --> 00:47:21.92
You join this team, you're here until the season's over, whether you like the coach,

501
00:47:21.92 --> 00:47:25.24
whether you play or not play, you do not quit.

502
00:47:25.24 --> 00:47:26.96
So they were raised that way.

503
00:47:26.96 --> 00:47:32.000
You make that decision because one of them is children to understand.

504
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.92
They make these decisions, then they have to live by them.

505
00:47:34.92 --> 00:47:39.92
And it's just short little tests, but it was important that they started understanding.

506
00:47:39.92 --> 00:47:43.56
You know, you just on a whim decide you want to play football.

507
00:47:43.56 --> 00:47:46.60
So he was raised like you don't quit.

508
00:47:46.60 --> 00:47:53.36
And all those kids, it was hard on them because they were just getting wasted.

509
00:47:53.36 --> 00:47:55.60
I mean, there was no first down.

510
00:47:55.60 --> 00:47:57.60
There was no completed pass.

511
00:47:57.60 --> 00:47:59.60
They were just totally outclassed.

512
00:47:59.60 --> 00:48:03.44
But Michael always figures there's always a chance.

513
00:48:03.44 --> 00:48:08.88
And if he would have got one touchdown, he would have felt like we have our dignity.

514
00:48:08.88 --> 00:48:14.94
So that's, he was just, he did not like, he didn't mind losing as much if he gave everything,

515
00:48:14.94 --> 00:48:17.68
but just to lose that just wasn't Michael.

516
00:48:17.68 --> 00:48:19.32
He used to have a thing.

517
00:48:19.32 --> 00:48:20.32
He bunk bet.

518
00:48:20.32 --> 00:48:27.40
He was on the bottom and Joe was on the top and he even on his inside, when you woke up

519
00:48:27.40 --> 00:48:30.96
in the morning, there was a little message, you know, never quit.

520
00:48:30.96 --> 00:48:34.000
And he carried that for, you know, his whole life.

521
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Yeah.

522
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.76
He was, he was a believer in once you sat it, then live with it.

523
00:48:39.76 --> 00:48:40.76
Yeah.

524
00:48:40.76 --> 00:48:45.88
You go on to say here, Michael's line harder determination grew stronger as he grueled

525
00:48:45.88 --> 00:48:50.44
or he played as a defensive end for the Argonaut varsity football team while he's in high school

526
00:48:50.44 --> 00:48:52.96
and was known for being one of the hardest workers on the field.

527
00:48:52.96 --> 00:48:56.60
Asthma continued to challenge Michael, but he was not going to let it dictate how he

528
00:48:56.60 --> 00:48:57.60
lived.

529
00:48:57.60 --> 00:49:00.88
Sally remembers how Santa Anna wins coming in from the mountains each fall would affect

530
00:49:00.88 --> 00:49:02.24
Michael's breathing.

531
00:49:02.24 --> 00:49:04.88
One afternoon she opened the door to his bedroom to find him wheezing.

532
00:49:04.88 --> 00:49:07.44
She asked him why he wasn't using his inhaler.

533
00:49:07.44 --> 00:49:09.80
I'm weaning myself off it, mom.

534
00:49:09.80 --> 00:49:13.76
Although unable to fully rid himself of the ailment, Michael would not let it stop him

535
00:49:13.76 --> 00:49:16.20
from accomplishing what he set out to achieve.

536
00:49:16.20 --> 00:49:18.84
So he's just freaking tough.

537
00:49:18.84 --> 00:49:19.84
He is.

538
00:49:19.84 --> 00:49:21.40
He's very determined.

539
00:49:21.40 --> 00:49:28.60
And I think all the, the, the way he was treated, you know, when he was younger, bullies

540
00:49:28.60 --> 00:49:30.72
just they have a sense.

541
00:49:30.72 --> 00:49:32.56
There's the weak one.

542
00:49:32.56 --> 00:49:37.000
And he just made it his life not to be the weak week one.

543
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.52
I mean, I remember when he was in the sixth grade, he told me, he says, it's going to

544
00:49:40.52 --> 00:49:41.92
be over.

545
00:49:41.92 --> 00:49:43.52
He says, this will stop.

546
00:49:43.52 --> 00:49:45.16
Oh, this is the bullying?

547
00:49:45.16 --> 00:49:46.16
Yeah.

548
00:49:46.16 --> 00:49:48.60
He says, this will stop.

549
00:49:48.60 --> 00:49:52.64
And he just determined to get stronger.

550
00:49:52.64 --> 00:49:58.92
And even verbally, I mean, people didn't realize if you know him that his tongue was sharp

551
00:49:58.92 --> 00:50:03.08
when he wasn't, you know, as strong as he would go the other way.

552
00:50:03.08 --> 00:50:04.40
And he would embarrass them.

553
00:50:04.40 --> 00:50:09.92
I mean, he had a very good mind and he would just trash them.

554
00:50:09.92 --> 00:50:12.96
And they know that whatever they would do, he would take it.

555
00:50:12.96 --> 00:50:17.64
I've seen him take these hits knowing he'd come back and say, what happened?

556
00:50:17.64 --> 00:50:23.08
And, you know, his brother would say, Hey, those guys, you know, went after Mike because

557
00:50:23.08 --> 00:50:25.28
he went after them verbally.

558
00:50:25.28 --> 00:50:29.32
And you know, he would fight, but he was just outgunned, but he never would back down.

559
00:50:29.32 --> 00:50:34.60
He was little and he had to pay, you know, all of them had to have a discipline.

560
00:50:34.60 --> 00:50:36.56
We had rules in the family.

561
00:50:36.56 --> 00:50:43.92
And if he wasn't buying the rule, he would literally just, okay, I'll take the two days

562
00:50:43.92 --> 00:50:50.04
in my bedroom or whatever and our bedroom, those bedrooms didn't have TVs and video games.

563
00:50:50.04 --> 00:50:53.44
But I never, never beef about it or anything.

564
00:50:53.44 --> 00:50:54.96
You just take his medicine.

565
00:50:54.96 --> 00:50:56.96
There you go.

566
00:50:56.96 --> 00:50:57.96
Yeah.

567
00:50:57.96 --> 00:50:59.48
He's playing football.

568
00:50:59.48 --> 00:51:02.24
How were his grades in high school?

569
00:51:02.24 --> 00:51:03.24
Here's Michael.

570
00:51:03.24 --> 00:51:04.24
I don't know.

571
00:51:04.24 --> 00:51:11.48
Michael in the sixth grade, it was determined they had very high IQ and it was determined

572
00:51:11.48 --> 00:51:18.08
because we had a meeting and the teacher says he just doesn't do anything.

573
00:51:18.08 --> 00:51:21.36
He ignores me and he doesn't do his homework.

574
00:51:21.36 --> 00:51:22.36
And he goes in there.

575
00:51:22.36 --> 00:51:23.88
As a matter of fact, there's his backpack.

576
00:51:23.88 --> 00:51:25.60
He has to even take it home.

577
00:51:25.60 --> 00:51:28.56
He goes and gets it and he says, you might as well take this home.

578
00:51:28.56 --> 00:51:31.48
And in the backpack had all these papers in it.

579
00:51:31.48 --> 00:51:32.80
So he opens it up.

580
00:51:32.80 --> 00:51:38.92
Teacher opens it up and he's looking at all the homework he did and the tests he took.

581
00:51:38.92 --> 00:51:45.16
He goes, he goes, you know, I think your kid's really pretty smart.

582
00:51:45.16 --> 00:51:51.64
And that's when they start putting him into the, to the higher classes and he was fine

583
00:51:51.64 --> 00:51:52.64
with it.

584
00:51:52.64 --> 00:51:57.04
And he got towards the end of high school, he's bored and I get a letter from the high

585
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:05.84
school registered letter that says your son has all F's and he's not going to graduate.

586
00:52:05.84 --> 00:52:09.92
Bring him into the office and I say, you understand this family works, right?

587
00:52:09.92 --> 00:52:11.32
I have my job.

588
00:52:11.32 --> 00:52:12.32
You have your job.

589
00:52:12.32 --> 00:52:13.32
Wait, what's the office?

590
00:52:13.32 --> 00:52:14.32
This is in your house.

591
00:52:14.32 --> 00:52:15.32
You have the office.

592
00:52:15.32 --> 00:52:17.80
This is where counseling takes place with the children.

593
00:52:17.80 --> 00:52:22.48
Well, I spent a lot of time in there praying that I had some money in the bank and I just

594
00:52:22.48 --> 00:52:23.48
keep looking at it.

595
00:52:23.48 --> 00:52:24.88
Now it's still the same.

596
00:52:24.88 --> 00:52:27.36
And I says, now this works.

597
00:52:27.36 --> 00:52:32.16
I says, you have a job and the job is to get through school.

598
00:52:32.16 --> 00:52:34.20
That's your job.

599
00:52:34.20 --> 00:52:37.12
And I says, you got straight F's.

600
00:52:37.12 --> 00:52:39.64
They're telling me that you will not graduate.

601
00:52:39.64 --> 00:52:42.88
Do you think that's going to play out with me?

602
00:52:42.88 --> 00:52:45.12
And I says, you know, you won't be living here.

603
00:52:45.12 --> 00:52:46.40
You don't do your job.

604
00:52:46.40 --> 00:52:47.88
You don't live here.

605
00:52:47.88 --> 00:52:49.44
You're gone.

606
00:52:49.44 --> 00:52:51.88
And he just smiles.

607
00:52:51.88 --> 00:52:54.40
And he says, don't worry, dad.

608
00:52:54.40 --> 00:52:56.68
I got this.

609
00:52:56.68 --> 00:53:01.40
And boom, he turns it around.

610
00:53:01.40 --> 00:53:03.60
Straight A's all the way up.

611
00:53:03.60 --> 00:53:06.88
And then he smiles and he goes, I got it.

612
00:53:06.88 --> 00:53:14.92
There's something about him that when he's bored, then he made it harder just to, you

613
00:53:14.92 --> 00:53:16.68
know, test himself.

614
00:53:16.68 --> 00:53:21.56
And the things he did when he was young was always testing himself.

615
00:53:21.56 --> 00:53:27.76
He just, it was almost like, since I had race horses, it was like having a young horse that

616
00:53:27.76 --> 00:53:31.20
she didn't allow him to get out of the stall.

617
00:53:31.20 --> 00:53:33.40
And he just wanted to run and wanted to run.

618
00:53:33.40 --> 00:53:36.08
Michael wanted to run, but he couldn't.

619
00:53:36.08 --> 00:53:39.12
He just wasn't strong enough.

620
00:53:39.12 --> 00:53:46.32
And once he got stronger, he just wanted to run and he did.

621
00:53:46.32 --> 00:53:47.68
So he graduates from high school.

622
00:53:47.68 --> 00:53:49.44
What was his plan when he graduated from high school?

623
00:53:49.44 --> 00:53:51.04
Because he graduated in 99.

624
00:53:51.04 --> 00:53:53.92
Well, and we're in a couple years later.

625
00:53:53.92 --> 00:53:54.92
Yeah.

626
00:53:54.92 --> 00:53:55.92
So what was he doing in the meantime?

627
00:53:55.92 --> 00:54:02.68
His plan was to go into the military, but he wanted to have a good time before he went

628
00:54:02.68 --> 00:54:05.96
into the military.

629
00:54:05.96 --> 00:54:08.04
So we had a good time.

630
00:54:08.04 --> 00:54:13.96
And then I remember telling him, you know, the good times over, it's time for you to

631
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:17.12
make a decision.

632
00:54:17.12 --> 00:54:22.80
Was Jim in the Marine Corps at this point?

633
00:54:22.80 --> 00:54:23.80
Or had Jim already gone to the Marine Corps?

634
00:54:23.80 --> 00:54:25.08
You know, I can't remember.

635
00:54:25.08 --> 00:54:26.92
I think Jim was in the Marines.

636
00:54:26.92 --> 00:54:27.92
Yeah.

637
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:28.92
He was in the Marines.

638
00:54:28.92 --> 00:54:32.60
Another one that doesn't say anything to his dad.

639
00:54:32.60 --> 00:54:36.68
Hey, dad, I'm going, I'm going to join the Marines.

640
00:54:36.68 --> 00:54:38.20
Well, would you even join the Marines?

641
00:54:38.20 --> 00:54:40.56
He was, well, I'm going in tomorrow.

642
00:54:40.56 --> 00:54:41.56
What?

643
00:54:41.56 --> 00:54:48.24
And I knew Michael was talking about going in.

644
00:54:48.24 --> 00:54:53.92
I had no idea that that's what's his plan.

645
00:54:53.92 --> 00:54:58.24
In the book, it says that it sounds like you're the one that had kind of told him about the

646
00:54:58.24 --> 00:54:59.96
Seal Teams where he had asked you about it.

647
00:54:59.96 --> 00:55:01.68
He had asked me about it.

648
00:55:01.68 --> 00:55:08.32
And I remember, because we would drop guys off and would you practice things and being

649
00:55:08.32 --> 00:55:09.96
in the Marines to do with Navy guys?

650
00:55:09.96 --> 00:55:13.64
And then we had our recon guys.

651
00:55:13.64 --> 00:55:15.44
So we do a lot of the same things.

652
00:55:15.44 --> 00:55:16.44
Recon?

653
00:55:16.44 --> 00:55:20.80
Everyone forgot about recon.

654
00:55:20.80 --> 00:55:24.36
Anyway, so he was fascinated with it.

655
00:55:24.36 --> 00:55:27.84
You know, like any young kid, he wanted to hear about these guys.

656
00:55:27.84 --> 00:55:32.52
I had no idea what was going on in his head.

657
00:55:32.52 --> 00:55:38.80
And because he was so sickly, he's the last guy I thought that would be a Seal.

658
00:55:38.80 --> 00:55:44.20
And I always thought to myself, he's got a great mind and he's going to be one of those

659
00:55:44.20 --> 00:55:47.28
eggheads and I'm good with that.

660
00:55:47.28 --> 00:55:51.000
But his mind was not thinking that way.

661
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.84
And I was really kind of taken back when I found out after he graduated from Navy Bootcamp.

662
00:55:58.84 --> 00:56:01.04
His instructor told me.

663
00:56:01.04 --> 00:56:03.60
His instructor told you that he was going to try and be a Seal?

664
00:56:03.60 --> 00:56:06.16
He says, you got a great son here.

665
00:56:06.16 --> 00:56:11.000
He goes, this guy is great and he's definitely Seal material.

666
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
And what?

667
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:19.48
And is that the first time you knew that he was going to try and go to Buds or he was going

668
00:56:19.48 --> 00:56:20.48
to Buds?

669
00:56:20.48 --> 00:56:27.36
Yeah, he talked about Seals, but I never really registered that he was serious about that.

670
00:56:27.36 --> 00:56:33.44
And we teased him anyway because he went into the Navy because we were all Marines.

671
00:56:33.44 --> 00:56:37.96
A whole family all the way back to World War II Marines.

672
00:56:37.96 --> 00:56:42.56
And it was like, I was good with it, the Navy.

673
00:56:42.56 --> 00:56:46.20
But then the Seal thing just caught me.

674
00:56:46.20 --> 00:56:51.80
And I still remember he had that funny smile.

675
00:56:51.80 --> 00:56:56.04
So he's in the Navy.

676
00:56:56.04 --> 00:56:59.24
He ends up at Buds.

677
00:56:59.24 --> 00:57:03.12
And Buds is what it is.

678
00:57:03.12 --> 00:57:06.32
And what it is is freaking brutal.

679
00:57:06.32 --> 00:57:08.88
And I'm going to go to the book here.

680
00:57:08.88 --> 00:57:11.48
It was now late fall, 2001.

681
00:57:11.48 --> 00:57:12.76
The days were shorter.

682
00:57:12.76 --> 00:57:14.52
The air was cooler.

683
00:57:14.52 --> 00:57:18.04
Michael was exhausted and decided to head home for the weekend to get some much needed

684
00:57:18.04 --> 00:57:19.56
rest in the midst of vigorous training.

685
00:57:19.56 --> 00:57:20.92
A lot of people don't know this.

686
00:57:20.92 --> 00:57:24.88
When you're at Buds, basic Seal training, people think you get locked away on some island

687
00:57:24.88 --> 00:57:25.88
somewhere.

688
00:57:25.88 --> 00:57:31.92
No, you basically work Monday through Friday and then weekends you recover.

689
00:57:31.92 --> 00:57:35.28
And if you want to recover by drinking, you can do it.

690
00:57:35.28 --> 00:57:40.44
If you want to recover by laying in bed and icing your knees, you can do that too.

691
00:57:40.44 --> 00:57:42.64
It's kind of up to you.

692
00:57:42.64 --> 00:57:44.52
And Michael decided he's going to go home.

693
00:57:44.52 --> 00:57:47.000
So George knew something was wrong as soon as Michael returned home.

694
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.16
Michael wasn't walking right.

695
00:57:48.16 --> 00:57:51.60
And as George looked down at his feet, he could see why.

696
00:57:51.60 --> 00:57:53.64
Michael's socks were bloody and Michael was miserable.

697
00:57:53.64 --> 00:57:54.72
Michael, what are you doing?

698
00:57:54.72 --> 00:57:55.84
You're not going to make it like that.

699
00:57:55.84 --> 00:57:57.000
Dad, I'm not quitting.

700
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.68
Michael, you can't even walk and your feet are a bloody mess.

701
00:57:59.68 --> 00:58:02.12
You're leaving footprints all over the kitchen floor.

702
00:58:02.12 --> 00:58:04.36
I'm not quitting.

703
00:58:04.36 --> 00:58:09.20
Michael bandaged up his feet as best he could and headed back to Coronado Prepair for training

704
00:58:09.20 --> 00:58:10.20
the following day.

705
00:58:10.20 --> 00:58:13.92
The bandages did little to keep the sand out of the lesions on his feet.

706
00:58:13.92 --> 00:58:19.76
And every step he took was like running sandpaper across the open sores, bringing excruciating

707
00:58:19.76 --> 00:58:20.76
pain.

708
00:58:20.76 --> 00:58:24.04
Both feet were an absolute mess, yet Michael pushed on.

709
00:58:24.04 --> 00:58:28.12
The pain continued to build and was not only draining him menly, but rapidly slowed his

710
00:58:28.12 --> 00:58:32.56
pace affecting his ability to perform the required evolutions.

711
00:58:32.56 --> 00:58:36.52
He was disgusted with what had begun to creep into his conscious thought.

712
00:58:36.52 --> 00:58:40.14
He hated to see weakness in others, but hated it even more in himself.

713
00:58:40.14 --> 00:58:42.80
With every pain filled step, it became clearer.

714
00:58:42.80 --> 00:58:47.20
He was forced to acknowledge what he had tried to ignore, the reality that he would not be

715
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:49.28
able to continue.

716
00:58:49.28 --> 00:58:55.04
It was the 24th hour of the first day of Hell Week, the third week of the six month pipeline,

717
00:58:55.04 --> 00:58:59.16
regarded as the most challenging week of Bud's training cycle when students are expected

718
00:58:59.16 --> 00:59:06.24
to run upwards of 200 miles and are allowed to only 3-4 hours of sleep the entire week.

719
00:59:06.24 --> 00:59:09.16
Michael stood up and did what he thought he would never do.

720
00:59:09.16 --> 00:59:13.84
He walked over to the notorious bell, affixed to a pillar directly in front of the first

721
00:59:13.84 --> 00:59:20.80
phase office, and rang it three times, alerting the whole compound that he was finished.

722
00:59:20.80 --> 00:59:24.88
Michael made a left face, walked achingly down the sidewalk that was already lined with

723
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:28.000
helmets of those who had not made it to this point.

724
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.76
When he reached the end, he made one more left face, took off his helmet, and placed

725
00:59:32.76 --> 00:59:35.40
it next to the others.

726
00:59:35.40 --> 00:59:38.40
He had quit.

727
00:59:38.40 --> 00:59:40.40
Dang.

728
00:59:40.40 --> 00:59:47.000
It was devastated.

729
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:57.36
I remember when he told me, and his eyes were just filled with tears, he just could not

730
00:59:57.36 --> 00:59:59.68
believe that he quit.

731
00:59:59.68 --> 01:00:04.52
He just couldn't believe it.

732
01:00:04.52 --> 01:00:07.56
It was just so sad.

733
01:00:07.56 --> 01:00:12.20
I didn't even have words.

734
01:00:12.20 --> 01:00:14.08
I kind of didn't want him to be a seal.

735
01:00:14.08 --> 01:00:15.96
Well, I didn't want him to be a seal.

736
01:00:15.96 --> 01:00:21.28
But I knew how much it meant to him, especially at that moment.

737
01:00:21.28 --> 01:00:23.24
I just really didn't.

738
01:00:23.24 --> 01:00:29.40
I could remember how when they were kids, I would tell them, it's your defeat, and how

739
01:00:29.40 --> 01:00:31.28
do you come back from the defeat?

740
01:00:31.28 --> 01:00:35.56
That's what makes you the man or the woman is the way you come back.

741
01:00:35.56 --> 01:00:37.80
I couldn't even remember that.

742
01:00:37.80 --> 01:00:39.08
I was struck by it.

743
01:00:39.08 --> 01:00:41.68
He was just so sad.

744
01:00:41.68 --> 01:00:49.80
The next morning, he's up making some breakfast.

745
01:00:49.80 --> 01:00:59.20
He says, remember when you say, I'm going to be a seal.

746
01:00:59.20 --> 01:01:02.80
Then it began.

747
01:01:02.80 --> 01:01:10.24
He was back on track, and he was going to be a seal.

748
01:01:10.24 --> 01:01:11.80
He ends up getting state.

749
01:01:11.80 --> 01:01:15.80
Again, the book has so many good details of all this.

750
01:01:15.80 --> 01:01:22.40
Eventually, he ends up getting stationed in Italy, in Aci Trezza, and immediately, and

751
01:01:22.40 --> 01:01:27.88
he's with a couple other guys that are on the same boat he is in.

752
01:01:27.88 --> 01:01:34.04
Man, that program's tough.

753
01:01:34.04 --> 01:01:35.88
They began training.

754
01:01:35.88 --> 01:01:37.40
They began getting ready.

755
01:01:37.40 --> 01:01:38.40
They're swimming.

756
01:01:38.40 --> 01:01:39.40
They're running.

757
01:01:39.40 --> 01:01:46.12
They're cliff jumping, getting into some of this stuff here.

758
01:01:46.12 --> 01:01:49.48
For Michael and his friends, they were determined to push themselves as hard as necessary to

759
01:01:49.48 --> 01:01:51.000
train their bodies for the rigors of buds.

760
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.04
They were getting a second shot, and they knew they were not about to blow it.

761
01:01:55.04 --> 01:01:57.56
They would do whatever it took to be ready this time around.

762
01:01:57.56 --> 01:02:01.24
Michael's most traumatic experience thus far in life was ringing the bell and quitting

763
01:02:01.24 --> 01:02:05.64
buds, and he would not be satisfied without a second chance to prove to himself that he

764
01:02:05.64 --> 01:02:06.64
could do it.

765
01:02:06.64 --> 01:02:10.72
Michael told his younger brother, Joe, that this second time around, they would have to

766
01:02:10.72 --> 01:02:13.96
drag his dead body off the beach before he would quit.

767
01:02:13.96 --> 01:02:16.52
That does not surprise me with Michael.

768
01:02:16.52 --> 01:02:19.32
It scared his brother.

769
01:02:19.32 --> 01:02:25.88
You know, Joe was like, that could be true, dad.

770
01:02:25.88 --> 01:02:28.52
Got some good stories in here about Italy.

771
01:02:28.52 --> 01:02:29.52
They're in Sicily.

772
01:02:29.52 --> 01:02:31.64
They got nightlife.

773
01:02:31.64 --> 01:02:33.24
Michael's buying vehicles.

774
01:02:33.24 --> 01:02:35.84
He buys a Russian truck.

775
01:02:35.84 --> 01:02:37.76
He buys a Lancia.

776
01:02:37.76 --> 01:02:42.12
You say this, Michael also pursed a Lancia, an incredibly fast car with all-wheel drive

777
01:02:42.12 --> 01:02:44.000
and used to cruise it all throughout Italy.

778
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.88
The higher the speed, the better, until one afternoon when Ollie, that's one of his buddies,

779
01:02:47.88 --> 01:02:51.28
got a call from Mike, he had crashed it racing an Audi.

780
01:02:51.28 --> 01:02:54.92
They were flying down the Sicily highway when Mike hit a wet spot and lost control.

781
01:02:54.92 --> 01:02:55.92
It was on.

782
01:02:55.92 --> 01:02:58.88
Lancia spun and slammed directly into the concrete divider wall.

783
01:02:58.88 --> 01:03:02.64
Luckily, he wasn't hurt and was able to get it towed back to his home, but it was not

784
01:03:02.64 --> 01:03:03.96
looking good for the car.

785
01:03:03.96 --> 01:03:06.60
Ollie drove over to Mike's apartment to see how he could help.

786
01:03:06.60 --> 01:03:07.88
First, he saw the car.

787
01:03:07.88 --> 01:03:08.88
It was totaled.

788
01:03:08.88 --> 01:03:13.40
Then he saw Mike beer in hand, steak on the grill, and not a care in the world.

789
01:03:13.40 --> 01:03:16.96
It was good while it lasted, Mike said with his signature smile.

790
01:03:16.96 --> 01:03:17.96
That is Michael.

791
01:03:17.96 --> 01:03:18.96
That is 100%.

792
01:03:18.96 --> 01:03:24.16
I mean, this is just another.

793
01:03:24.16 --> 01:03:29.84
Mike got so many accidents in Italy, he opted to pay $200 a day for extra car rental insurance

794
01:03:29.84 --> 01:03:32.72
just to cover the shenanigans.

795
01:03:32.72 --> 01:03:36.40
He liked freaking vehicles and cars and motorcycles.

796
01:03:36.40 --> 01:03:37.76
That might have been my fault.

797
01:03:37.76 --> 01:03:43.52
I had a motorcycle when I was a kid and I remember Sal always would get on and then

798
01:03:43.52 --> 01:03:51.24
I would drive a little crazy and should reach up into my shirt and pull my chest nose out.

799
01:03:51.24 --> 01:03:57.84
But Mike, when he was little, we had a 64GTO.

800
01:03:57.84 --> 01:04:04.80
That thing, from a dead stop, it would just scream.

801
01:04:04.80 --> 01:04:08.72
Mike was just a little guy and he'd hold on to the handle over the glovebox and he'd

802
01:04:08.72 --> 01:04:10.72
just go, Dad, go.

803
01:04:10.72 --> 01:04:19.16
I'd burn through those gears and fish tailing and he's just in heaven.

804
01:04:19.16 --> 01:04:24.20
We had this long on-route to the freeway where you could see the freeway before you got on.

805
01:04:24.20 --> 01:04:29.80
He had this long ramp and so he knew I could do it there and I would.

806
01:04:29.80 --> 01:04:36.48
So I just burned through the gears and then he can smell the smoke from the tires.

807
01:04:36.48 --> 01:04:38.28
He's just a huge smile.

808
01:04:38.28 --> 01:04:41.04
He said, Dad, we're going 100 miles an hour.

809
01:04:41.04 --> 01:04:43.000
I was like, about half of that.

810
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Give or take 50.

811
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.72
I don't know if I can get on feet.

812
01:04:45.72 --> 01:04:48.80
But he just loved the acceleration.

813
01:04:48.80 --> 01:04:56.68
And I didn't realize that it would have such an effect because he loved fast stuff.

814
01:04:56.68 --> 01:04:57.68
Yeah.

815
01:04:57.68 --> 01:04:59.68
And he just did.

816
01:04:59.68 --> 01:05:01.96
Yeah, including Lancia.

817
01:05:01.96 --> 01:05:02.96
Yeah.

818
01:05:02.96 --> 01:05:08.84
So if parents read this, it's a great book for your children except for that kid slowed

819
01:05:08.84 --> 01:05:09.84
down a little bit.

820
01:05:09.84 --> 01:05:13.68
That might have been a mistake on my part.

821
01:05:13.68 --> 01:05:15.56
Fast forward a little bit here.

822
01:05:15.56 --> 01:05:18.96
It says as the two years came to an end as he inch closer to heading back to Coronado

823
01:05:18.96 --> 01:05:22.08
for a second shot at Buds, Michael felt strong and strong and ready.

824
01:05:22.08 --> 01:05:26.04
Michael still contended with his severe asthma, which caused him to be rarely without his

825
01:05:26.04 --> 01:05:31.000
inhaler, but he would not concede to this ailment in any shape or form.

826
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.08
One afternoon as Chris, that's another one of his buddies talks about and Mike ran side

827
01:05:35.08 --> 01:05:37.04
by side on one of their last hard runs.

828
01:05:37.04 --> 01:05:40.32
Mike pushed himself harder and harder to beat his friend Chris.

829
01:05:40.32 --> 01:05:45.60
Chris pulled ahead, it pissed off Mike, he pissed off Mike, grabbed his inhaler, chucked

830
01:05:45.60 --> 01:05:50.44
it across the road and sprinted until he beat Chris and finished the run.

831
01:05:50.44 --> 01:05:53.48
That was the last time Chris ever saw Mike use his inhaler.

832
01:05:53.48 --> 01:05:54.68
He didn't have room for weakness.

833
01:05:54.68 --> 01:05:57.80
It was all or nothing this time around.

834
01:05:57.80 --> 01:06:01.28
He was mentally ready for Buds.

835
01:06:01.28 --> 01:06:05.12
It was like bring it.

836
01:06:05.12 --> 01:06:08.28
I mean, and it sounds like his attitude going in.

837
01:06:08.28 --> 01:06:10.40
Obviously, you know what to expect.

838
01:06:10.40 --> 01:06:12.56
You don't want to make that mistake.

839
01:06:12.56 --> 01:06:21.52
Although one of my roommates was a former Buds quitter and he was back again and I was

840
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:25.64
like, well, you know, he's probably going to, he's a little older, you know, kind of,

841
01:06:25.64 --> 01:06:28.40
I was thinking, hey, you know, he's guys going to be good to go.

842
01:06:28.40 --> 01:06:30.96
But sure enough, first night of Halloween, he quit.

843
01:06:30.96 --> 01:06:33.000
So there's no, there's still no guarantee.

844
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.48
It's what you change in your brain.

845
01:06:34.48 --> 01:06:35.48
Yeah.

846
01:06:35.48 --> 01:06:36.48
And he was more prepared.

847
01:06:36.48 --> 01:06:42.04
I remember, I think the last thing I said to him when he left was watch the sand because

848
01:06:42.04 --> 01:06:44.08
that really destroyed me.

849
01:06:44.08 --> 01:06:50.12
He wasn't, he just didn't take care of himself that first time around.

850
01:06:50.12 --> 01:06:52.64
So he was definitely determined.

851
01:06:52.64 --> 01:06:57.12
He was in good shape and mentally he was determined.

852
01:06:57.12 --> 01:06:59.72
Yeah.

853
01:06:59.72 --> 01:07:02.32
He had a friend named Gabe Lynch.

854
01:07:02.32 --> 01:07:04.48
And this kid was like an Oregon farm boy.

855
01:07:04.48 --> 01:07:06.36
So you had like the California kid.

856
01:07:06.36 --> 01:07:07.36
Yeah.

857
01:07:07.36 --> 01:07:11.52
They had some pretty good experiences that they talk about in the book that you guys

858
01:07:11.52 --> 01:07:12.52
talk about in the book.

859
01:07:12.52 --> 01:07:16.92
It says, Gabe and Michael were both part of boat crew three.

860
01:07:16.92 --> 01:07:19.52
They were close in height, standing just around six foot one.

861
01:07:19.52 --> 01:07:23.88
Gabe recalls how Mike was always one to brighten the mood of the guys during the often exhausting

862
01:07:23.88 --> 01:07:29.64
days of being beaten by by the ocean surf while wet and sandy all day long.

863
01:07:29.64 --> 01:07:31.96
Gabe was the slower runner between the two of them.

864
01:07:31.96 --> 01:07:36.40
And he remembers Mike hanging out in the back with him as they would push through their

865
01:07:36.40 --> 01:07:37.96
four mile time runs.

866
01:07:37.96 --> 01:07:41.40
He would encourage Gabe, then sprint back up to the front and finish easily in the top

867
01:07:41.40 --> 01:07:43.02
tier runners every time.

868
01:07:43.02 --> 01:07:46.08
That was the kind of guy Mike was always looking out for his buddies.

869
01:07:46.08 --> 01:07:50.88
He could see who needed a word of encouragement or or action of support and would deliver

870
01:07:50.88 --> 01:07:52.68
it at just the right time.

871
01:07:52.68 --> 01:07:56.92
Sometimes that's all it took when a guy was delirious running on a few hours of sleep

872
01:07:56.92 --> 01:07:59.16
for a for days on end.

873
01:07:59.16 --> 01:08:03.56
Even though Michael had not yet made it and become part of the seal brotherhood, brotherhood

874
01:08:03.56 --> 01:08:07.44
itself was something he already understood in the depths of his core.

875
01:08:07.44 --> 01:08:12.40
He was not going to let his friends down.

876
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:16.36
And he was always that way.

877
01:08:16.36 --> 01:08:22.76
When he was a little kid, when we were living in that other neighborhood, it was pretty

878
01:08:22.76 --> 01:08:23.76
poor.

879
01:08:23.76 --> 01:08:28.88
I wasn't uncommon for him to take a Christmas gifts and give them away to his friends.

880
01:08:28.88 --> 01:08:31.56
I'd see his friends playing with the gifts.

881
01:08:31.56 --> 01:08:38.000
If you were his friend and if you speak to his friends, they will say that he truly was

882
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.84
a true friend and he was always on their side.

883
01:08:40.84 --> 01:08:42.44
And that's just the way it was.

884
01:08:42.44 --> 01:08:47.08
So the brotherhood was perfect for Michael.

885
01:08:47.08 --> 01:08:48.08
Perfect place.

886
01:08:48.08 --> 01:08:49.08
Yeah.

887
01:08:49.08 --> 01:08:55.16
The quick scene from Hell Week.

888
01:08:55.16 --> 01:08:58.72
Just because this just sounded like Mikey, man.

889
01:08:58.72 --> 01:09:01.48
With paddles in hand, they begin to row in unison.

890
01:09:01.48 --> 01:09:05.16
They had just taken the first few strokes in an evolution aptly named around the world,

891
01:09:05.16 --> 01:09:09.80
which entails paddling their small boats from San Diego Bay north through the channel around

892
01:09:09.80 --> 01:09:13.12
the tip of Coronado Island back to Buds Beach, a staggering 13 miles.

893
01:09:13.12 --> 01:09:15.80
As they paddled, Gabe couldn't hold back any longer.

894
01:09:15.80 --> 01:09:20.28
He started to doze off and without missing a beat, Michael shouted over to him from

895
01:09:20.28 --> 01:09:25.36
his side of the boat, Hey man, I love you, bro, but you need to wake up.

896
01:09:25.36 --> 01:09:31.76
That's all it took for you to jar Gabe back to consciousness and help him focus.

897
01:09:31.76 --> 01:09:33.44
They end up securing Hell Week.

898
01:09:33.44 --> 01:09:36.52
They lost about 75% of their people.

899
01:09:36.52 --> 01:09:42.80
Obviously, Michael made it.

900
01:09:42.80 --> 01:09:43.80
Got Ray.

901
01:09:43.80 --> 01:09:44.80
It's just great.

902
01:09:44.80 --> 01:09:47.76
Ray Bobviera, another guy from from Tasking to Bruiser.

903
01:09:47.76 --> 01:09:52.76
It was the LPO of their Buds class.

904
01:09:52.76 --> 01:09:57.16
They're getting ready to go out to San Clemente Island, which is the third phase of training.

905
01:09:57.16 --> 01:10:01.36
It's the last phase of training.

906
01:10:01.36 --> 01:10:05.76
Before going out there, Michael planned a little boat trip.

907
01:10:05.76 --> 01:10:11.000
Again, I'm going to fast forward to this part just because it's funny to read about Michael

908
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.56
being an avid adventurer had planned a spearfishing trip and brought Gabe and another buddy of

909
01:10:15.56 --> 01:10:20.16
theirs, Chris Kimbrell from their Buds class along for the weekend.

910
01:10:20.16 --> 01:10:23.96
Gabe knew how to spearfish like Mike and they were naturals in the water, but for Chris,

911
01:10:23.96 --> 01:10:27.84
a Midwest landlocked boy, this escapade was not his forte.

912
01:10:27.84 --> 01:10:32.04
He was ready to go forward though and couldn't wait to see what the picturesque island had

913
01:10:32.04 --> 01:10:33.04
to offer.

914
01:10:33.04 --> 01:10:36.32
Chris was one of the first all suited up and couldn't wait to get going.

915
01:10:36.32 --> 01:10:41.36
Before Gabe had even dropped the anchor, Chris jumped in the water to see what he could find.

916
01:10:41.36 --> 01:10:45.20
Moments later, he burst through the surface proudly holding up his spear.

917
01:10:45.20 --> 01:10:49.76
There on the end of his six foot Hawaiian sling flopped a beautiful orange fish.

918
01:10:49.76 --> 01:10:51.48
Chris yelled and triumphed.

919
01:10:51.48 --> 01:10:55.48
Michael immediately dove to the water tackling Chris as he pulled the spear from his hand.

920
01:10:55.48 --> 01:10:58.52
That's a Garabalbi, the state fish of California.

921
01:10:58.52 --> 01:11:00.76
It's super legal to hunt, dude.

922
01:11:00.76 --> 01:11:02.56
Michael yelled at Chris.

923
01:11:02.56 --> 01:11:04.52
There were other fishing boats all around.

924
01:11:04.52 --> 01:11:08.60
Anyone that couldn't have seen the fish that Chris had on the end of his sling, Michael

925
01:11:08.60 --> 01:11:12.16
quickly snatched the fish from the tip of the spear and dove to the bottom.

926
01:11:12.16 --> 01:11:13.44
He found a large rock and wish.

927
01:11:13.44 --> 01:11:20.32
So that's just like classic for Chris, Chris Cribbell, Chris Cribbell, Brell, who's, you

928
01:11:20.32 --> 01:11:22.32
know, a landlock guy.

929
01:11:22.32 --> 01:11:23.32
He didn't know.

930
01:11:23.32 --> 01:11:24.32
He didn't know.

931
01:11:24.32 --> 01:11:25.32
He's like, look what I got.

932
01:11:25.32 --> 01:11:26.32
Yeah, this Garabalbi are everywhere.

933
01:11:26.32 --> 01:11:29.16
You see him going, oh, this is easy hunt.

934
01:11:29.16 --> 01:11:33.80
That's classic.

935
01:11:33.80 --> 01:11:37.88
Third phase, the last remaining block again, fast forwarded the last block before graduating

936
01:11:37.88 --> 01:11:42.20
buds entailed instruction on seal weapons and tactics lasting around eight to 10 weeks

937
01:11:42.20 --> 01:11:45.72
of students covered land navigation, land war for ambushes and raids, patrolling weapons,

938
01:11:45.72 --> 01:11:47.64
handling and marksmanship and demolition.

939
01:11:47.64 --> 01:11:51.20
Michael and his classmates were on San Clement Island, focusing specifically on raids, ambushes

940
01:11:51.20 --> 01:11:54.16
and demolition.

941
01:11:54.16 --> 01:11:59.40
San Clemente Island is a rocky volcanic island off the coast of California with hardly any

942
01:11:59.40 --> 01:12:04.52
trees, lots of cactus, no natural fresh water, full of caves and caverns formed by gas bubbles

943
01:12:04.52 --> 01:12:10.000
in the lava when the island was molten mass as the men focused specifically on ambushes

944
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.52
and raids, Ray Bobbierra, who continued as Michael's squad LPO through third phase recalls

945
01:12:14.52 --> 01:12:19.20
how Michael would find a way to make light throughout the arduous and nonstopped evolutions

946
01:12:19.20 --> 01:12:27.72
bringing humor to any situation, brightening anyone's mood.

947
01:12:27.72 --> 01:12:30.56
And that's something that everybody, everybody says that about Mike.

948
01:12:30.56 --> 01:12:35.84
No matter what's going on, he's just going to be sitting there, putting everybody back

949
01:12:35.84 --> 01:12:36.84
into a good mood.

950
01:12:36.84 --> 01:12:41.76
Yeah, he thought it was actually important, especially if people are getting stressed

951
01:12:41.76 --> 01:12:47.52
out, like in Buds, he can see it on their faces and he thought, you know, he's seeing

952
01:12:47.52 --> 01:12:54.28
these guys are going on tilt, you know, and, you know, our family does that, you know,

953
01:12:54.28 --> 01:12:58.84
they'll equip this and that, you know, and he's always done that when things get real

954
01:12:58.84 --> 01:13:06.16
serious and it kind of brings people down.

955
01:13:06.16 --> 01:13:13.36
So it says third phase was coming to close just a few weeks later.

956
01:13:13.36 --> 01:13:16.56
And as the men prepared to graduate, they were discussing what gift to give the command

957
01:13:16.56 --> 01:13:17.96
in their memory.

958
01:13:17.96 --> 01:13:21.52
They all want to leave something in their name from Buds class 250 that was immovable

959
01:13:21.52 --> 01:13:22.52
and unique.

960
01:13:22.52 --> 01:13:26.96
They decided to give basic training command an enormous boulder with their names engraved

961
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:28.24
upon it.

962
01:13:28.24 --> 01:13:32.44
Now the class had to figure out how to track down a boulder and grave it and have it delivered

963
01:13:32.44 --> 01:13:33.80
to the command.

964
01:13:33.80 --> 01:13:36.88
Today's wife Maria was back home in San Diego and took care of the logistics.

965
01:13:36.88 --> 01:13:41.36
What began as an idea quickly escalated into a four ton boulder that would have to be delivered

966
01:13:41.36 --> 01:13:45.16
by a crane who would end up costing $7,000 in change.

967
01:13:45.16 --> 01:13:49.000
Each guy was given the option to back out after the final pricing was determined and

968
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.16
not one guy did.

969
01:13:50.16 --> 01:13:51.80
They were all in this together.

970
01:13:51.80 --> 01:13:57.02
What the final gift became was something none of the Bud students would forget and their

971
01:13:57.02 --> 01:14:01.64
memory forever lives on etched into the boulder that was engraved with the following words,

972
01:14:01.64 --> 01:14:07.04
the actions of the few dictate the fate of many by Alexander the Great and it also says

973
01:14:07.04 --> 01:14:09.80
the secret to Buds is underneath this rock.

974
01:14:09.80 --> 01:14:20.28
So Buds classes give gifts to Buds and depending on the class and what they do some of the

975
01:14:20.28 --> 01:14:22.96
gifts are pretty awesome some of them are pretty lame.

976
01:14:22.96 --> 01:14:26.48
I think my class gave a pretty lame.

977
01:14:26.48 --> 01:14:29.60
We gave a like a little speaking podium.

978
01:14:29.60 --> 01:14:31.08
That's beautiful.

979
01:14:31.08 --> 01:14:37.72
Yeah, the story behind it was one of the instructors was up at the podium talking to us and as

980
01:14:37.72 --> 01:14:44.08
he was talking to us, he got mad and he smashed his hands down on the podium and the thing

981
01:14:44.08 --> 01:14:48.08
like exploded and like broke apart and all these pieces and he started yelling and we

982
01:14:48.08 --> 01:14:54.44
all go hit the surf and so we like had this special one made and the funny part about

983
01:14:54.44 --> 01:14:59.76
that story is years later I saw that guy the guy that had smashed his podium and it exploded

984
01:14:59.76 --> 01:15:04.04
like he was the incredible Hulk and I said he was a master chief by this time and I go

985
01:15:04.04 --> 01:15:11.24
hey master chief he's like hmm and I go when because he was a hard dude I go when my class

986
01:15:11.24 --> 01:15:16.40
was going through and you were the dive phase chief I said you smashed your hands on this

987
01:15:16.40 --> 01:15:18.64
podium and it like exploded.

988
01:15:18.64 --> 01:15:26.20
I said was that like a was that like a set was like a trick thing and he looks at me

989
01:15:26.20 --> 01:15:35.72
and he goes negative it was oak reinforced and I was like okay so people give these various

990
01:15:35.72 --> 01:15:39.52
different gifts and people give some some stuff's really cool probably the most famous

991
01:15:39.52 --> 01:15:44.88
one is the the creature from the black lagoon it's a life-size statue of the creature the

992
01:15:44.88 --> 01:15:49.60
black lagoon and it says so you want to be a frog man little sign hung on it but this

993
01:15:49.60 --> 01:15:53.20
was an awesome gift it's this massive freaking rock.

994
01:15:53.20 --> 01:15:59.56
It's going to be there for a while it's not going anywhere and so that's what they gave

995
01:15:59.56 --> 01:16:07.48
I didn't see that until a race showed it to me we were invited to watch hell week with

996
01:16:07.48 --> 01:16:13.40
the seals we watch it from on top of a roof on one of the buildings and then I feel so

997
01:16:13.40 --> 01:16:20.24
sorry for those guys it was like for the poor guys people should just see that no and these

998
01:16:20.24 --> 01:16:25.64
guys are doing it because they want to do it this is amazing what they go through but

999
01:16:25.64 --> 01:16:31.36
after after that then he showed me the rock I knew it was there I never really you know

1000
01:16:31.36 --> 01:16:36.76
I just yeah there's a rock you know and then it went over and showed me and it was nice

1001
01:16:36.76 --> 01:16:42.84
and I could see where they were they were rubbing on the names and obviously they were rubbing

1002
01:16:42.84 --> 01:16:45.44
a lot on Michael so it was kind of nice.

1003
01:16:45.44 --> 01:16:50.76
It's awesome and it's in a really prominent spot it's like as you as you leave the compound

1004
01:16:50.76 --> 01:16:56.64
to go to the beach or come back you go right by the rock.

1005
01:16:56.64 --> 01:17:01.96
Michael graduated buds on September 2, 2004 back on Coronado Island California the graduation

1006
01:17:01.96 --> 01:17:06.56
day was memorable for all the men stood proudly in their clean crisp dress uniforms and each

1007
01:17:06.56 --> 01:17:11.48
weighted in anticipation for their name to be called across the compound a giant crane

1008
01:17:11.48 --> 01:17:15.76
labored with a four-ton boulder carefully placed in a large rock in the much deliberately

1009
01:17:15.76 --> 01:17:22.44
position where its weight could not would not crush the buried utilities below it.

1010
01:17:22.44 --> 01:17:26.20
Michael's parents George and Sally as well as three siblings Jim, Sarah and Joe were

1011
01:17:26.20 --> 01:17:28.20
in attendance to celebrate the achievement.

1012
01:17:28.20 --> 01:17:31.52
George recalls the smile on Michael's face as he walked up to embrace him following the

1013
01:17:31.52 --> 01:17:36.16
ceremony he had this look on his eyes that seemed to say to me dad I hope you didn't

1014
01:17:36.16 --> 01:17:40.36
doubt me I told you I was going to do this and I did it I told you so I loved seeing

1015
01:17:40.36 --> 01:17:44.68
him like that it gave me so much joy I never wanted him to join the seals but I was so

1016
01:17:44.68 --> 01:17:47.32
proud to be proved wrong by my son.

1017
01:17:47.32 --> 01:17:53.84
I love it when my kids prove me wrong because it's kind of a challenge I was I don't think

1018
01:17:53.84 --> 01:17:58.28
you can really do that I don't I don't I don't know if you could do that and I love

1019
01:17:58.28 --> 01:18:05.000
it when they come to me and say I did it and you don't know nothing and I mean they I'm

1020
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.72
sure they catch on but to see my kids stick to something all of them and then they accomplish

1021
01:18:10.72 --> 01:18:15.56
it it's just you know you're you feel great.

1022
01:18:15.56 --> 01:18:18.44
How did you feel when he got through hell week the second time you must have been like

1023
01:18:18.44 --> 01:18:24.16
okay thank god.

1024
01:18:24.16 --> 01:18:31.68
It was funny I I kind of though his attitude I really would have been surprised if he didn't

1025
01:18:31.68 --> 01:18:38.44
because he had these friends too and once he makes these friendships he's going to be

1026
01:18:38.44 --> 01:18:44.92
with them and push them through so I just I really I would have been more surprised

1027
01:18:44.92 --> 01:18:46.84
if he didn't make it.

1028
01:18:46.84 --> 01:18:52.40
Yeah that's the wild thing I mean you start out with a couple hundred kids in your class

1029
01:18:52.40 --> 01:18:57.44
they're quitting so fast that they're just there you don't even know what's happening

1030
01:18:57.44 --> 01:19:03.60
yeah and and so you got to be a little bit careful because if you don't if you get to

1031
01:19:03.60 --> 01:19:08.000
know someone kind of while you're there and all of a sudden they quit yeah that all of

1032
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.80
a sudden you go I'm alone so for him to have some good friends rolling in there is definitely

1033
01:19:12.80 --> 01:19:17.80
nice and yeah.

1034
01:19:17.80 --> 01:19:22.56
Got another guy here Michael and Z went through all of Bud's together they grab they graduated

1035
01:19:22.56 --> 01:19:27.52
from Bud's basic airborne seal qualification training now assigned to seal team three Z

1036
01:19:27.52 --> 01:19:34.000
to Echo platoon and Mike to Delta platoon the weeks were busy training and the weekends

1037
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.88
were spent riding their bikes and that's motorcycles by the way chasing girls hanging out with

1038
01:19:37.88 --> 01:19:43.20
the guys after a day of riding they'd often come back to connect and unwind at bar Dynamite

1039
01:19:43.20 --> 01:19:46.92
a small bar in Mission Bay where they'd grab drinks with friends including Gabe and other

1040
01:19:46.92 --> 01:19:55.000
freshly minted and another freshly minted seal Tommy D. Mike was Mike was living life

1041
01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.72
to the fullest he was renting this house in Mission Bay while the new guys like myself

1042
01:20:00.72 --> 01:20:06.20
lived in one small bedroom small one bedroom apartment said Z laughing a motorcycle and

1043
01:20:06.20 --> 01:20:10.84
a stellar pal pad were not the only things Michael set his sights on he was eyeing his

1044
01:20:10.84 --> 01:20:16.40
next car and he knew exactly what he wanted just received a contract bonus that he used

1045
01:20:16.40 --> 01:20:27.52
to buy a silver 2004 Corvette Z zero six Michael could never be a financial advisor this is

1046
01:20:27.52 --> 01:20:31.36
like the classic thing I tell guys not to do when they get their bonus I should go hey

1047
01:20:31.36 --> 01:20:36.36
listen don't go buy a Corvette don't go buy a Ford 350 super duty Harley Davidson don't

1048
01:20:36.36 --> 01:20:40.88
don't do that it's hard to talk about I know I know especially with the junkers that like

1049
01:20:40.88 --> 01:20:49.76
that so he's got that Mike was living the dream in Southern California but he also understood

1050
01:20:49.76 --> 01:20:54.12
his team was on short fuse to surge into combat areas in the Middle East he knew the coming

1051
01:20:54.12 --> 01:20:58.28
months would include a fire hose of information intense training as platoon is going to war

1052
01:20:58.28 --> 01:21:03.08
and how fast he learned and integrated into platoon and his role could mean all the difference

1053
01:21:03.08 --> 01:21:10.68
yeah he took that real serious when he was home he was studying he definitely got to

1054
01:21:10.68 --> 01:21:17.24
the point where I do not want to make a mistake I mean it was like he really wanted to make

1055
01:21:17.24 --> 01:21:26.92
sure that he was on it yeah and and it was so long ago for me like when you're a new

1056
01:21:26.92 --> 01:21:34.44
guy there is so much it's just stuff to know and you don't want to make a mistake everyone's

1057
01:21:34.44 --> 01:21:39.36
watching you and you just want to do good and you're going to be counted on you know

1058
01:21:39.36 --> 01:21:45.92
these guys are going to be counting on you so and we also had a condensed work up because

1059
01:21:45.92 --> 01:21:52.20
at the time the war was hot and heavy this is now 2005 going into 2006 the used to be

1060
01:21:52.20 --> 01:21:57.000
18 months to train and get ready to go on deployment well for us was six months like

1061
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.16
12 months boom and you're out the door so they it was everything was compressed and

1062
01:22:02.16 --> 01:22:08.96
there was a lot of stuff being being forced down the throats of everybody and yeah you

1063
01:22:08.96 --> 01:22:15.80
there's a there's a story in here about the Roger that which which so I'm I'm talking

1064
01:22:15.80 --> 01:22:20.52
to new guys and it was a particular block of training where it's close quarters combat

1065
01:22:20.52 --> 01:22:25.60
the instructors are it's live fire and close quarters which means you're shooting right

1066
01:22:25.60 --> 01:22:29.90
next to guys right you know you're two feet from someone you're shooting of 12 inches

1067
01:22:29.90 --> 01:22:35.04
off their muzzle it is tight quarters it's super dangerous and so you've got to be heads

1068
01:22:35.04 --> 01:22:40.52
up and the instructors have to be really hard to make sure that you don't mess anything

1069
01:22:40.52 --> 01:22:46.36
up and so I took the new guys and said listen when you're going through this block of training

1070
01:22:46.36 --> 01:22:51.20
those instructors tell you something your your response is Roger that I don't want to

1071
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:55.20
hear like well I was thinking this or I could do what I didn't see no does you know say

1072
01:22:55.20 --> 01:23:02.04
any that the instructors talk to you say Roger that and so we're going through this training

1073
01:23:02.04 --> 01:23:05.28
and as we're going through this training you know I'm friends with all the instructors

1074
01:23:05.28 --> 01:23:09.20
are like all we're all friends but the new guys don't really know him that well but finally

1075
01:23:09.20 --> 01:23:14.48
one of the instructors is a good as a master chief he comes up he goes he goes hey John

1076
01:23:14.48 --> 01:23:19.44
Haco what's up with this Montsour guy and I was kind of I didn't really know something

1077
01:23:19.44 --> 01:23:25.64
was wrong and I go what do you mean Mike he's you know he's good to go he's like what's

1078
01:23:25.64 --> 01:23:29.52
up with his attitude and I go what do you mean what's wrong with his attitude and he

1079
01:23:29.52 --> 01:23:32.24
goes every time I tell him something one of the instructors tell him so all he does look

1080
01:23:32.24 --> 01:23:37.76
out up at us and say Roger that that's all he has and I go hey bro I told him that's

1081
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:43.12
all he's supposed to say and he's just following that to a T that's what he's doing and when

1082
01:23:43.12 --> 01:23:49.80
he would say that the guys that he's with are like kind of smirking like no one knew

1083
01:23:49.80 --> 01:23:55.60
if he was a smart ass or he's just following your orders that's a I'll tell you so here's

1084
01:23:55.60 --> 01:24:02.08
another similar story we're you were in the Humvees and this we're going through the block

1085
01:24:02.08 --> 01:24:09.04
of training with Humvees and the the gunners call out you know like clear right like you

1086
01:24:09.04 --> 01:24:13.04
come up to an intersection and the gunners which is Mikey call out clear right or clear

1087
01:24:13.04 --> 01:24:20.32
left and you know Mikey's up there and I'm I'm the I'm the vehicle commander so I'm sitting

1088
01:24:20.32 --> 01:24:26.44
in the passenger seat and he's up there and like we get to our first time doing it and

1089
01:24:26.44 --> 01:24:31.08
we come up to an intersection and he's like clear right I could barely hear him you know

1090
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:35.12
and I look down at him or I look up and I kind of hit him on the leg I was like hey man

1091
01:24:35.12 --> 01:24:42.04
you got a sound off and he's like he goes Roger that next intersection we pull up to

1092
01:24:42.04 --> 01:24:49.28
it and he's like clear right super over a compensating and I thought to myself hold on a second

1093
01:24:49.28 --> 01:24:56.64
yeah is he being a wise ass or and then we pulled the next intersection clear right and

1094
01:24:56.64 --> 01:25:01.16
in here's a thing he wasn't being a wise ass I told him to freaking sound off if you want

1095
01:25:01.16 --> 01:25:08.000
it you will get it I got it but that's but that was a you know that attitude that Roger

1096
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.68
that attitude man that's um that that was it you know that was he was gonna he was gonna

1097
01:25:14.68 --> 01:25:26.56
get it done one of the first blocks of training work up was land war for out at Nile in California

1098
01:25:26.56 --> 01:25:31.28
by the Salton Sea with a hundred and seven degree summer average it's a scorching place

1099
01:25:31.28 --> 01:25:35.36
to train and sure enough we were out there in the summertime this combined with a schedule

1100
01:25:35.36 --> 01:25:39.36
rocky mounted terrain scarred with washes makes the literal and figurative crucible of the

1101
01:25:39.36 --> 01:25:43.32
work up here's where the platoon will work on the tactics techniques and procedures of

1102
01:25:43.32 --> 01:25:47.80
fighting in open terrain as well as demolitions rockets and mortars and all the different

1103
01:25:47.80 --> 01:25:52.32
small arms weapons systems of the sea arsenal a platoon is normally made up of 16 to 20

1104
01:25:52.32 --> 01:25:56.36
operators each having a specific role to include snipers preachers communicators and automatic

1105
01:25:56.36 --> 01:26:00.72
weapons gunners to name a few although specialized within the platoon each man is still responsible

1106
01:26:00.72 --> 01:26:05.56
to be proficient at the other jobs Michael and the other new guys could not wait to jump

1107
01:26:05.56 --> 01:26:09.36
right in and get started Michael caught on very quickly especially with his automatic

1108
01:26:09.36 --> 01:26:14.48
weapon the mark 48 each of the new guys were being watched closely by the older men in

1109
01:26:14.48 --> 01:26:20.08
the platoon his LPO Doug Wallace remembers how that even though Michael is quickly picking

1110
01:26:20.08 --> 01:26:24.40
up on the tactics and performing all tasks efficiently and without complaint it was always

1111
01:26:24.40 --> 01:26:29.92
with humility and a willingness to learn more misery loves company and Nile and is a block

1112
01:26:29.92 --> 01:26:34.36
where there's many reasons to complain of our intense conditions Mike never did once

1113
01:26:34.36 --> 01:26:38.08
not one time it showed great character and understanding on his part especially for a

1114
01:26:38.08 --> 01:26:46.20
new guy Doug said and then there's another section here so it's there's like a little

1115
01:26:46.20 --> 01:26:50.92
gang mentality going on and part of it is like you're going to fight each other sometimes

1116
01:26:50.92 --> 01:26:57.92
now so they're having some boxing matches and I'm using that term very loosely.

1117
01:26:57.92 --> 01:27:04.92
This is not professionals but they'll set up like a tournament and generally or oftentimes

1118
01:27:04.92 --> 01:27:09.04
is just the new guys have to fight each other.

1119
01:27:09.04 --> 01:27:14.88
So this is going down and it says here came down to Mike the last standing new guy from

1120
01:27:14.88 --> 01:27:19.08
Delta since so in tasking approvers is to two platoons Charlie and Delta it came down to

1121
01:27:19.08 --> 01:27:25.36
the last standing new guy in Delta which was Mike versus Kevin Lace the final remaining

1122
01:27:25.36 --> 01:27:32.28
new guy in Charlie. Kevin was huge 225 pound tower of muscle loomed over most team guys

1123
01:27:32.28 --> 01:27:36.88
at a height of six foot three Mike was much smaller and more slender but he wouldn't give

1124
01:27:36.88 --> 01:27:42.76
up he was a lean scrappy dude recalled Kevin I remember hitting him as hard as I could

1125
01:27:42.76 --> 01:27:47.48
but there was no shaking him we had no boxing form we were street fighting at that point

1126
01:27:47.48 --> 01:27:52.24
with boxing gloves on I looked at him and it seemed as if his eyes were crossed and I

1127
01:27:52.24 --> 01:27:56.72
continued to hit him over and over again but he wouldn't stop he returned below after

1128
01:27:56.72 --> 01:28:00.76
blow right back we got so into it that I'm sure we were both seeing red but each of

1129
01:28:00.76 --> 01:28:06.48
us refused to back down both platoons cheered and taunted as each man hit the other over

1130
01:28:06.48 --> 01:28:11.40
and over again clad in only their boots and camo pants the two men continued to brawl

1131
01:28:11.40 --> 01:28:16.72
neither could defeat the other and in the end the older men called it a tie Kevin had

1132
01:28:16.72 --> 01:28:22.04
hugged Mike once they stopped and cooled down your tough son of a bitch Mike Kevin said

1133
01:28:22.04 --> 01:28:31.20
laughing yeah and Kevin Lace is just a like a giant dude thick and there's Mikey and

1134
01:28:31.20 --> 01:28:36.64
Mikey he got jacked later but at this point just coming out of Buds he was pretty lean

1135
01:28:36.64 --> 01:28:43.08
still yeah even though yeah he was yeah there wasn't he wasn't a real big guy when he just

1136
01:28:43.08 --> 01:28:49.20
got out he was definitely lean though yeah endurance wise a guy could go for a long time

1137
01:28:49.20 --> 01:28:54.16
but mentally I'm not surprised that he hung in there because he went through those mental

1138
01:28:54.16 --> 01:29:00.36
things as a kid people messing with him and stuff mentally he was just really very strong

1139
01:29:00.36 --> 01:29:08.56
yeah so we that's what we're doing it we're going through this work up we do land warfare

1140
01:29:08.56 --> 01:29:15.44
we do mobility we do close quarters combat we do urban warfare at Fort Knox we used

1141
01:29:15.44 --> 01:29:20.32
to do it Fort Knox we do diving we do jumping we do a bunch of stuff back in San Diego and

1142
01:29:20.32 --> 01:29:27.68
and we're working hard that's what we're doing and we actually at the beginning of our training

1143
01:29:27.68 --> 01:29:34.72
cycle we as task unit bruiser didn't know where we were deploying to know because there

1144
01:29:34.72 --> 01:29:40.08
was three task units one of them had already been designated to go to Iraq because they

1145
01:29:40.08 --> 01:29:47.12
went to the Pacific the last time so it was between my task unit and another task unit

1146
01:29:47.12 --> 01:29:50.28
to see who is going to go to Iraq of course everybody wants to go to Iraq everybody wants

1147
01:29:50.28 --> 01:29:53.44
to go fight the other one the other tunes going to do a different mission but it's not

1148
01:29:53.44 --> 01:29:57.68
fighting it was the Philippines I think it was as I said to my kind says well maybe you

1149
01:29:57.68 --> 01:30:06.24
get lucky and go the Philippines he looked at me like you poor pathetic old man no yeah

1150
01:30:06.24 --> 01:30:13.16
exactly so no one wants to go to the Philippines no one wants to go to the southeast Asia everyone

1151
01:30:13.16 --> 01:30:19.20
wants to go to Iraq and it's a basically the commanding officer is going to pick and we

1152
01:30:19.20 --> 01:30:25.04
pushed hard and we were supposed to go to Baghdad our original deployment was to go

1153
01:30:25.04 --> 01:30:32.40
to Baghdad and there was a mission in Baghdad that was working directly with this group

1154
01:30:32.40 --> 01:30:38.04
called the Iraqi counterterrorism force the ICTF Iraqi counter these are local I mean

1155
01:30:38.04 --> 01:30:43.04
Iraqi guys and they had been really well trained they're probably the best well the best trained

1156
01:30:43.04 --> 01:30:48.12
of all Iraqi troops they had really nice gear they had uniforms like they had everything

1157
01:30:48.12 --> 01:30:53.36
no and there was a there was a group of seals with them and there's a group of army army

1158
01:30:53.36 --> 01:31:01.68
special forces guys all working with these Iraqis and I actually went on a pre deployment

1159
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:07.44
site survey we call it I went before we went on deployment to go and meet up with those

1160
01:31:07.44 --> 01:31:11.72
guys see what the mission was like get a heads up on everything because that's where we're

1161
01:31:11.72 --> 01:31:16.20
going going to Baghdad so I come back from that we're prepared we know what our mission

1162
01:31:16.20 --> 01:31:22.20
is and where everyone goes on pre deployment leave so everyone goes you know like hey well

1163
01:31:22.20 --> 01:31:26.84
okay we're going on deployment soon and that's when we got the whole deployment changed around

1164
01:31:26.84 --> 01:31:33.32
and my commanding officer is calls me in he's like hey you're not you guys aren't going

1165
01:31:33.32 --> 01:31:40.40
to Baghdad anymore you guys are going to go to Ramadi and well Ramadi we knew Ramadi

1166
01:31:40.40 --> 01:31:45.44
was the worst place in Iraq and everybody wanted to go there just like everyone wanted

1167
01:31:45.44 --> 01:31:49.88
to go to Iraq well everyone wanted to go to Ramadi I mean the commanding officer said

1168
01:31:49.88 --> 01:31:56.52
it to me like I was going to be sad now the the the mission in Baghdad was a cool mission

1169
01:31:56.52 --> 01:32:02.24
to and it was kind of all set up and running so it was kind of is like ready made like

1170
01:32:02.24 --> 01:32:06.44
you know what you're going to be doing Ramadi was kind of the Wild West still but when he

1171
01:32:06.44 --> 01:32:11.60
he said it to me he was making it seem like he needed to convince me that hey this is

1172
01:32:11.60 --> 01:32:16.88
what this is what's going to happen you know are you okay with that and I was like I realized

1173
01:32:16.88 --> 01:32:19.32
the kind of the tone of his voice I was kind of like well you know so I'm going to need

1174
01:32:19.32 --> 01:32:31.36
some more people I need some more gear but he was great and and then we reshuffled and

1175
01:32:31.36 --> 01:32:38.56
we reshuffled and got ready to go and I don't even I don't think I even I think I don't

1176
01:32:38.56 --> 01:32:45.96
even think we notified the guys because everyone was on leave and you couldn't tell them like

1177
01:32:45.96 --> 01:32:52.80
on an in a on a non-secure net net like hey we're going to Ramadi now like you it's classified

1178
01:32:52.80 --> 01:32:57.52
so is the name everyone came back we had another week or whatever it's like hey everyone we're

1179
01:32:57.52 --> 01:33:03.20
not going to back down anymore we're going to Ramadi and the guys were ecstatic they're

1180
01:33:03.20 --> 01:33:12.64
ecstatic and this some of the stuff you cover in the book Sarin Sally come down to help

1181
01:33:12.64 --> 01:33:19.000
Mikey pack up all this stuff he takes he takes his mom for a little ride in the Corvette

1182
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.92
got read about that one he did it on the motorcycle too but she was used to the bike

1183
01:33:24.92 --> 01:33:30.96
with me when I used to take her on my bike so he was kind of disappointed because she

1184
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:40.68
she did get scared down she was nice right Mikey have a nice day and be careful he goes

1185
01:33:40.68 --> 01:33:49.36
up to Garden Grove spent the last couple days up there and I'm going to read this the time

1186
01:33:49.36 --> 01:33:53.68
had come George and Michael awoke early in the morning and drove back down the I5 South

1187
01:33:53.68 --> 01:33:57.32
the San Diego the trip seemed to pass much faster than either would have liked once they

1188
01:33:57.32 --> 01:34:01.72
arrived in Coronado George gave his son a big final hug as he said goodbye with a kiss

1189
01:34:01.72 --> 01:34:06.36
on the cheek George felt the knot deep down in his stomach but he refused to acknowledge

1190
01:34:06.36 --> 01:34:10.12
it the idea that this could be the last time he saw his son was not something he wanted

1191
01:34:10.12 --> 01:34:18.48
to think about as George drove home he recalled an evening with his son from two weeks prior

1192
01:34:18.48 --> 01:34:23.44
he lit up a Fuente cigar for Michael and himself on their front porch they sat together in

1193
01:34:23.44 --> 01:34:31.32
silence amid the cool air under the dark sky while smoke slowly drifted in the light breeze

1194
01:34:31.32 --> 01:34:35.48
George's voice broke the silence to address what they were both thinking Mikey what if

1195
01:34:35.48 --> 01:34:40.04
something happens to you it's not exactly a walk in the park over in Ramadi right now

1196
01:34:40.04 --> 01:34:49.48
please don't be a hero just do your job dad no matter what happens I have no regrets this

1197
01:34:49.48 --> 01:34:54.64
reassurance from Michael helped but George still did not want Mike to go as a marine

1198
01:34:54.64 --> 01:35:00.04
vet George saw firsthand what Ward did to all those involved and he despised it he knew

1199
01:35:00.04 --> 01:35:04.48
it was unforgiving and brutal and how it could degrade and break the spirit he also knew

1200
01:35:04.48 --> 01:35:10.16
that Mike had been trained well by men who understood what he could be facing this brought

1201
01:35:10.16 --> 01:35:14.48
some consolation to George as they finished their cigars together that night George and

1202
01:35:14.48 --> 01:35:19.48
Mike George looked at Mike and the man he had become he was so proud of him from a determined

1203
01:35:19.48 --> 01:35:23.52
little boy who fought against the injustice of bullies and his own physical weakness of

1204
01:35:23.52 --> 01:35:29.000
asthma he persevered and overcame failure adversity and blocks of training he despised

1205
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.60
such as free fall parachuting and communication school all with focused conviction and often

1206
01:35:35.60 --> 01:35:58.36
a mischievous smile on his face he he definitely surprised me at that at that age his maturity

1207
01:35:58.36 --> 01:36:06.64
and he knew who he was talk to kids at his age in their early twenties and stuff like

1208
01:36:06.64 --> 01:36:14.44
that and they're still lost he had his morals he had his beliefs he's pretty rock solid

1209
01:36:14.44 --> 01:36:19.08
and if there were things that he didn't like I remember like jumping out of the planes

1210
01:36:19.08 --> 01:36:26.52
I used to do that too and we talked to me about it and then he says I don't like this

1211
01:36:26.52 --> 01:36:31.84
I don't like it at all and he says when you came back he planned on just doing that because

1212
01:36:31.84 --> 01:36:36.64
anything that he was afraid of he would just keep doing it and doing it till he owned

1213
01:36:36.64 --> 01:36:44.56
it and that's just the way it was and he didn't like communication school no it was hard and

1214
01:36:44.56 --> 01:36:54.84
he was studying all the time I said God I can't speed this up yeah going to the book

1215
01:36:54.84 --> 01:37:00.44
Mike loaded up his gear and followed his teammates to the waiting C-17 aircraft to C-17 multi-purpose

1216
01:37:00.44 --> 01:37:05.44
aircraft can be configured for transport of troops cargo or a combination of both though

1217
01:37:05.44 --> 01:37:08.88
this last configuration is often how special operations unit traveled through the small

1218
01:37:08.88 --> 01:37:13.16
footprint and nature of their mission sets to you bruiser was no exception and as soon

1219
01:37:13.16 --> 01:37:17.32
as the aircraft was in altitude Michael and his friends broke out their nylon hammocks

1220
01:37:17.32 --> 01:37:23.24
and ground pads and settled in for the long flight tasking a bruiser landed out to catam

1221
01:37:23.24 --> 01:37:28.48
airport in Iraq where they began to prepare for a short flight west to Ramadi after the

1222
01:37:28.48 --> 01:37:33.92
C-17 was unloaded each operated opened his war box and donned his combat equipment Michael

1223
01:37:33.92 --> 01:37:38.28
had done this hundreds of times throughout workup and his prior training trips this time

1224
01:37:38.28 --> 01:37:43.76
was different this was not training his enemy was now hardened war fighters whose will and

1225
01:37:43.76 --> 01:37:57.88
resolve would be used to exploit weakness in order to win the war

1226
01:37:57.88 --> 01:38:02.24
says here in the spring of 2006 the battle of Ramadi was just beginning and it was already

1227
01:38:02.24 --> 01:38:08.68
intense the city was arguably the epicenter was inarguably the epicenter of the insurgency

1228
01:38:08.68 --> 01:38:14.64
in Iraq and known throughout the area as the most dangerous city in the world wrote Leif

1229
01:38:14.64 --> 01:38:20.08
Bab and the officer in command of Charlie Patu task unit bruiser the al-Qaeda leader

1230
01:38:20.08 --> 01:38:27.12
in Iraq Abu Musab Zarkawi declared during that time that Ramadi would be the capital

1231
01:38:27.12 --> 01:38:32.48
of his envisioned Islamic caliphate in Iraq insurgents controlled over two thirds of the

1232
01:38:32.48 --> 01:38:38.24
city itself and certain areas were nearly impenetrable to United States and Iraqi security forces

1233
01:38:38.24 --> 01:38:44.60
US Marines and Army soldiers that were currently over there battled continually with large groups

1234
01:38:44.60 --> 01:38:50.60
of well armed and well organized enemy fighters so far 93 US service members had been killed

1235
01:38:50.60 --> 01:38:59.16
in action and hundreds more were wounded in nearly 15 months of fighting you remember

1236
01:38:59.16 --> 01:39:07.04
Michael Fuente I think it was yeah was telling me that the media would not even cover that

1237
01:39:07.04 --> 01:39:13.84
he was the only guy says they were just blowing those guys away and nobody would go the media

1238
01:39:13.84 --> 01:39:20.36
so my previous deployment was in Baghdad there was like hotels with CNN and you know all

1239
01:39:20.36 --> 01:39:27.68
the news set up Ramadi there wasn't anybody no there wasn't anybody and you know I just

1240
01:39:27.68 --> 01:39:31.68
I just had a guy on the podcast named David Belavia he's a Medal of Honor recipient from

1241
01:39:31.68 --> 01:39:39.64
Fallujah he was in the second battle Fallujah when the Marines pushed through yeah and he

1242
01:39:39.64 --> 01:39:45.20
he's one of the few people that did go to Ramadi as a report as a journalist and we're

1243
01:39:45.20 --> 01:39:51.12
sitting here you know his story you know about the second battle of Fallujah yeah it was a

1244
01:39:51.12 --> 01:40:00.56
brutal fighting and David Belavia sits here and says oh Ramadi was way worse which I look

1245
01:40:00.56 --> 01:40:04.84
I'm not trying to compare the two no but they were both yeah but they were both that story

1246
01:40:04.84 --> 01:40:13.32
yeah the stories yeah I definitely felt so bad for those Marines you know and then Ramadi

1247
01:40:13.32 --> 01:40:21.20
like yeah Michael would tell me that he told the family that he was just teaching the guys

1248
01:40:21.20 --> 01:40:29.68
how to march yeah yeah but we could see the news every once in a while you know or when

1249
01:40:29.68 --> 01:40:37.96
the pictures came out on the internet you know for when he had those pictures out he's

1250
01:40:37.96 --> 01:40:45.84
not to take pictures and we saw him on the internet and it's like that doesn't look like

1251
01:40:45.84 --> 01:40:49.92
you're training people how to march yeah I don't see anybody marching not other than

1252
01:40:49.92 --> 01:40:59.60
some guys then they're not marching they're running yeah I mean so it was basically on

1253
01:40:59.60 --> 01:41:06.60
as soon as we got there you know the what one of the indicators of that was the couple

1254
01:41:06.60 --> 01:41:10.72
days after so I'd I'd already been there for a little while with a few of the guys just

1255
01:41:10.72 --> 01:41:14.92
we were we got there before the rest of the task unit but as soon as the whole task unit

1256
01:41:14.92 --> 01:41:20.44
was there within a day I think it was like the night they got there we had like a little

1257
01:41:20.44 --> 01:41:27.48
attack on our base and we end up the whole freaking task units on the roof of our building

1258
01:41:27.48 --> 01:41:35.04
lighten up and engaging you know the enemy fighters out there and it was like okay that's

1259
01:41:35.04 --> 01:41:43.72
what it is that's how it's going to be almost within a couple days of being there I was

1260
01:41:43.72 --> 01:41:52.40
going to meet the brigade commander a guy named Colonel gronsky and I was literally walking

1261
01:41:52.40 --> 01:41:57.32
in to meet him and as I'm walking in to meet him we had already put out a sniper overwatch

1262
01:41:57.32 --> 01:42:04.52
position and Tony a fratty the Charlie platoon chief had shot and killed an IED in Placer

1263
01:42:04.52 --> 01:42:09.96
in an area where the Marines had just hit a big ID and lost a bunch of guys and as soon

1264
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:15.04
as that happened Colonel gronsky looked at me I mean so that's how I meet him he says

1265
01:42:15.04 --> 01:42:19.80
I think your guys just killed a an ID in Placer where I just lost Marines hey Roger that sir

1266
01:42:19.80 --> 01:42:25.88
he says we need you out in eastern Ramadi place called the Malab out correct Corregador

1267
01:42:25.88 --> 01:42:31.44
and I said Roger that you know and that's what we did as soon as soon as I get back

1268
01:42:31.44 --> 01:42:36.68
we plan all right they need us in eastern Ramadi and I took a probably two thirds of

1269
01:42:36.68 --> 01:42:43.48
the task unit over to Camp Corregador where the first the 506 is again as soon as we get

1270
01:42:43.48 --> 01:42:48.60
look we've been on the ground for like a couple days now maybe it's been like six days and

1271
01:42:48.60 --> 01:42:53.64
we're over there we get to Camp Corregador the snipers are like hey we can we get in

1272
01:42:53.64 --> 01:42:57.44
the towers because there's towers around Camp Corregador I'm like absolutely tell the army

1273
01:42:57.44 --> 01:43:02.12
guys were you you good with us putting snipers Colonel Colonel Clarks like absolutely they

1274
01:43:02.12 --> 01:43:11.52
start killing guys almost immediately enemy rocket teams mortar teams IED in places and

1275
01:43:11.52 --> 01:43:16.96
at the same time where we're out at Camp Corregador for a couple days the living conditions are

1276
01:43:16.96 --> 01:43:25.12
terrible in the life it was like dirt floors there's mosquitoes you know they're getting

1277
01:43:25.12 --> 01:43:32.40
murdered indirect fire on a regular basis just just it was just freaking horrible no showers just it was horrible

1278
01:43:32.40 --> 01:43:40.40
and so we do this initial mission out there and we come back to the bigger base and the

1279
01:43:40.40 --> 01:43:46.04
army's like hey thank you for coming can can we can you keep working with us as a matter

1280
01:43:46.04 --> 01:43:50.76
of fact their company commander these guys went out on patrol and this company commander

1281
01:43:50.76 --> 01:43:55.52
with a couple with an army company commander he comes back after his first patrol with my

1282
01:43:55.52 --> 01:43:59.60
guys and I walk with him to the battalion commander but then he tells the tank commander

1283
01:43:59.60 --> 01:44:04.56
I don't want to do another patrol without seals with me I want seals on every patrol

1284
01:44:04.56 --> 01:44:09.000
so Colonel Clarks looking at me like hey well can you get some guys out here I said let me

1285
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:17.60
sort it out so now I'm talking to Seth and you know Seth's like hey I want to pick the

1286
01:44:17.60 --> 01:44:23.52
guys to go back out there because I however it all shook out Seth had the had was the

1287
01:44:23.52 --> 01:44:29.36
opportune guy or the he had the the laif had already been assigned a guy this guy had been

1288
01:44:29.36 --> 01:44:32.68
already been assigned Iraqi troops to work with another guy been assigned Iraqi troops

1289
01:44:32.68 --> 01:44:38.000
with to work with I think Seth's the Iraqi troops Seth was supposed to work with originally

1290
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:45.04
quit like they didn't show up and so Seth was the guy that had the capacity so I said

1291
01:44:45.04 --> 01:44:48.60
are you're gonna go out to camp Corregidor and he says I just want to pick the guys I

1292
01:44:48.60 --> 01:44:55.60
want to take and I said hey man it sucks out there I said how about we do this let's put

1293
01:44:55.60 --> 01:45:01.56
a volunteer list up and if anybody wants to go back out there then then you can get volunteers

1294
01:45:01.56 --> 01:45:06.20
that way you're not forcing it down their throats Seth's like alright so bring the task unit

1295
01:45:06.20 --> 01:45:12.32
together and I'm like alright guys you you you all just came back from camp Corregidor

1296
01:45:12.32 --> 01:45:17.92
we're gonna send an element out there for deployment all I can tell you is it's gonna

1297
01:45:17.92 --> 01:45:25.64
suck the living conditions are awful the the the level of violence is extremely high as

1298
01:45:25.64 --> 01:45:30.92
you all saw and if you want to go back there then put your name on this list on the white

1299
01:45:30.92 --> 01:45:34.60
board and I walked out of the room and I came back 15 minutes later and everybody's name

1300
01:45:34.60 --> 01:45:40.56
was on the list including Michaels which meant that Seth got what he wanted which was he just

1301
01:45:40.56 --> 01:45:47.52
got to pick his guys yeah and Mikey was the was was for the guys there's no question he

1302
01:45:47.52 --> 01:45:54.40
was going with Seth yeah that that would that would have surprised me if he didn't yeah

1303
01:45:54.40 --> 01:46:04.36
no so there was a you know Seth and Tommy D and Mikey were real tight so I knew that

1304
01:46:04.36 --> 01:46:10.52
those three were gonna stick together so he didn't care Seth was a little shocked at Mikey

1305
01:46:10.52 --> 01:46:17.44
was decorating I remember when he got back he was telling me about his his pad oh yeah

1306
01:46:17.44 --> 01:46:21.60
well that's the good news is the good news is once they got over there and settled in

1307
01:46:21.60 --> 01:46:26.56
and we'll get to that part but they eventually squared away which seals are really good it

1308
01:46:26.56 --> 01:46:32.68
seals good it we got some rough living we'll fix it up but that but so they end up taking

1309
01:46:32.68 --> 01:46:37.80
the small element guys out there to go to camp Corregidor move in there working with

1310
01:46:37.80 --> 01:46:45.24
the first the 506 the band of brothers which was awesome and they get settled into this

1311
01:46:45.24 --> 01:46:50.36
operational tempo and settled into really what it is that they're going to be doing

1312
01:46:50.36 --> 01:46:59.64
there and I'll just example of this they get settled into what they're doing there get

1313
01:46:59.64 --> 01:47:05.48
settled into the combat operations and real quickly we go to the book here the army captain

1314
01:47:05.48 --> 01:47:10.60
sat peacefully in silence in one of the only places set apart from the chaos and violence

1315
01:47:10.60 --> 01:47:15.16
that was now Romadi Iraq he was a little old for the rank of captain but that was not uncommon

1316
01:47:15.16 --> 01:47:19.60
for a person with his specific duties in the military he had spent years in formation and

1317
01:47:19.60 --> 01:47:25.92
training and was now here in the thick of battle in Romadi the quiet was broken by a

1318
01:47:25.92 --> 01:47:30.96
firm knock at the door the man rose from his seat and moved to receive it he opened the

1319
01:47:30.96 --> 01:47:35.68
door to find a tall brown eyed dark-haired young man patiently waiting are you a Catholic

1320
01:47:35.68 --> 01:47:41.60
priest I am replied Father Halliday nice to meet you I am a Catholic and my name is Michael

1321
01:47:41.60 --> 01:47:47.84
Montsour I'd like to go to confession Father Halliday grabbed his stole and motion Michael

1322
01:47:47.84 --> 01:47:52.40
to follow him Father Halliday was 40 years old at the time of his deployment to Romadi

1323
01:47:52.40 --> 01:47:58.40
and was an army chaplain with the first the 506 his main mission was to assist the soldiers

1324
01:47:58.40 --> 01:48:02.44
of Camp Corregor to worship according to their own religion and preference but was an ordained

1325
01:48:02.44 --> 01:48:08.12
Catholic priest and was happy to oblige Michael's request for confession they sat down in the

1326
01:48:08.12 --> 01:48:13.44
makeshift chapel Michael had just arrived in Romadi and Father Halliday understood well

1327
01:48:13.44 --> 01:48:17.96
the situation the men were facing on a daily basis he thought it showed significant religious

1328
01:48:17.96 --> 01:48:23.36
formation and conviction for Michael to seek him out after only recently arriving in Romadi

1329
01:48:23.36 --> 01:48:35.92
yeah Michael he took his face serious and he also I mean he knew he was in a place where

1330
01:48:35.92 --> 01:48:44.000
he could lose his life and he wanted to be prepared everywhere spiritually physically

1331
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:55.84
mentally yeah and the I mean the fighting was it was sustained urban combat and I mean

1332
01:48:55.84 --> 01:49:01.68
guys were getting wounded or killed just about every day and and the first the 506 I mean

1333
01:49:01.68 --> 01:49:07.36
Charlie company the first the 506 who might he spent a lot of time working with they had

1334
01:49:07.36 --> 01:49:15.48
had like a third of their company casualties in four or five months so they 50 guys they

1335
01:49:15.48 --> 01:49:28.000
were down not all of them were killed but it was it was it was war now when we were

1336
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:35.68
in Fort Campbell and their commander brought in some of the guys that worked with Michael

1337
01:49:35.68 --> 01:49:40.72
and their stories you know and it's like you start realizing how many people they did lose

1338
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:49.28
and just how tough it was and I remember Sally breaking down hearing some of those stories

1339
01:49:49.28 --> 01:49:56.80
and thinking about Michael so it was people just don't get it how tough it was over there

1340
01:49:56.80 --> 01:50:07.68
some of what they were experiencing here they were in the middle of intense

1341
01:50:07.68 --> 01:50:14.96
firefights on almost daily basis the operating tempo they were facing required hyper focus and

1342
01:50:14.96 --> 01:50:20.16
the guys completely undeterred stepped up and went to work we asked a lot of our guys especially

1343
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:25.04
with the numbers of missions we were conducting while facing extreme heat dehydration and exhaustion

1344
01:50:25.04 --> 01:50:31.20
it didn't faze them they all stepped up and performed Mike Sarelli said there were army

1345
01:50:31.20 --> 01:50:35.76
and marine units also stationed in Ramadi that the seals were providing assistance to and one

1346
01:50:35.76 --> 01:50:42.24
of the large army battalions being the first the 506 this was the descendant from the band of brothers

1347
01:50:42.24 --> 01:50:47.76
from world war two the battalion was huge and led by lieutenant colonel Ron Clark his men were

1348
01:50:47.76 --> 01:50:52.96
professional talented and worked incredibly well with the seals Michael's troop commander

1349
01:50:52.96 --> 01:50:57.84
lieutenant commander jockel will he could instructed his men to use army to use the army's

1350
01:50:57.84 --> 01:51:04.64
uniform a tricolor gray digital pattern called army combat uniform or acu's it was very different

1351
01:51:04.64 --> 01:51:10.32
from the tricolor desert naval special warfare uniform the men wore it and even shaved their

1352
01:51:10.32 --> 01:51:15.04
heads to match their army brethren this was not only this not only increased the cohesion of the

1353
01:51:15.04 --> 01:51:20.88
two units but also had a very practical purpose by blending in with the army unit the seals did

1354
01:51:20.88 --> 01:51:25.36
not stand out as special forces the enemy had begun to target soldiers that looked or dressed

1355
01:51:25.36 --> 01:51:33.20
differently than the average so that's why when people see pictures of that element they're wearing

1356
01:51:33.20 --> 01:51:39.92
they're wearing army uniforms um that's what it is they wanted to blend in and wanted to

1357
01:51:40.48 --> 01:51:48.32
not stand out and wanted to form a relationship with the army you know there's just just you know

1358
01:51:48.32 --> 01:51:53.04
sometimes in special operations you know you can wear all this Gucci gear and it's like you're

1359
01:51:53.04 --> 01:51:59.84
trying to set yourself apart and we didn't want to do that how often does that happen where I see

1360
01:51:59.84 --> 01:52:06.32
you guys working with the Marines but working with the army is that something that's uh unusual or

1361
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:14.56
not unusual I would say it's not it's not unusual to this to this amount on this this much of

1362
01:52:14.56 --> 01:52:23.04
relationship working all the time yeah it's is a little less common uh but I mean that whole

1363
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:29.92
deployment was we didn't do any missions well we did barely any missions where we weren't with

1364
01:52:29.92 --> 01:52:34.64
an army or Marine Corps unit or at least adjacent to them at I mean we were definitely adjacent to

1365
01:52:36.08 --> 01:52:43.20
um but yeah the ACU thing that was because that was because those guys were living with them

1366
01:52:43.20 --> 01:52:47.92
and we just figured let's just win in Rome yeah

1367
01:52:52.80 --> 01:52:56.72
starting to get into this little the order of battle for the SEALs would largely consist of

1368
01:52:56.72 --> 01:53:01.44
word coming from the army 48 hours ahead of time informing them on what area of Ramadi they would

1369
01:53:01.44 --> 01:53:07.12
be patrolling the SEALs would then plan and provide sniper overwatch during the army patrol

1370
01:53:07.12 --> 01:53:12.000
even amid their overloaded operating schedule the men of Delta Platoon gathered supplies to build a

1371
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.84
home away from home in the tattered building where they would be spending the deployment they

1372
01:53:15.84 --> 01:53:19.84
nicknamed it full metal jacket so the building that they lived in called full metal jacket if you

1373
01:53:19.84 --> 01:53:23.44
see the movie full metal jacket that's what this building looked like a bunch of army guys living

1374
01:53:23.44 --> 01:53:29.44
in there too a plywood floor was laid the walls were reinforced with sandbags foam was sprayed

1375
01:53:29.44 --> 01:53:33.68
between the inner and outer layers for insulation they framed and built out rooms for each man and

1376
01:53:33.68 --> 01:53:40.32
installed a small AC unit to keep cool the air in certain parts of the building the men needed to

1377
01:53:40.32 --> 01:53:45.60
watch their step in order to expose to avoid exposed rebar the heat was miserable in May

1378
01:53:45.60 --> 01:53:51.44
reaching upwards of 115 degrees and fixing up and finishing full metal jacket was a welcome

1379
01:53:51.44 --> 01:53:57.04
reprieve the men of Delta Platoon had this once barely standing building a home away from home

1380
01:53:57.04 --> 01:54:01.20
by normal standards nothing to write home about but nonetheless a haven in the midst of the heat

1381
01:54:01.20 --> 01:54:11.60
yeah and that's where Mikey built Mikey's little yes he had it and just to you know we were talking

1382
01:54:11.60 --> 01:54:20.08
about um this was probably a month in and I had the Marine or sorry the Army Special Operations

1383
01:54:20.08 --> 01:54:31.60
Commander came to visit Task Unit Bruiser and I was briefing him on what was going on and I said my

1384
01:54:31.60 --> 01:54:41.28
element in Karegador has been out their last 23 missions they've been engaged by the enemy 23

1385
01:54:41.28 --> 01:54:48.08
straight missions in a row and as I'm saying that almost as if on cue one of the guys from my tactical

1386
01:54:48.08 --> 01:54:53.60
operation center comes in and says excuse me sir and I'm like yes and he says just to let you know

1387
01:54:53.60 --> 01:54:59.12
the guys in Karegador are in contact with the enemy right now and I looked at the the Sieges

1388
01:54:59.12 --> 01:55:07.20
Sodev commander and I said well sir make that 24 that's to sort of go out 24 operations in a row

1389
01:55:08.16 --> 01:55:14.16
and be an enemy contact it's what you were talking about earlier and I remember actually

1390
01:55:14.16 --> 01:55:19.04
the 25th operation I think it was the 25th operation they didn't have enemy contact

1391
01:55:19.04 --> 01:55:25.76
because they did something like really small and they broke their streak but it was

1392
01:55:28.08 --> 01:55:34.000
it was on and you got and again you interviewed a bunch of people for this

1393
01:55:35.92 --> 01:55:40.56
the deafening noise the machine gun fire suddenly erupted from an enemy insurgent position to the

1394
01:55:40.56 --> 01:55:44.16
right Michael dropped into his field of fire identifying the enemy position immediately sent

1395
01:55:44.16 --> 01:55:49.36
back a long burst with his mark 48 contact right multiple seals yelled as they sent round after

1396
01:55:49.36 --> 01:55:53.36
round toward the enemy Mike sprinted to the closest position to cover which was a courtyard

1397
01:55:53.92 --> 01:55:59.28
wall of a nearby house and picked up fire the other seals and the Iraqi army scouts moved into

1398
01:55:59.28 --> 01:56:05.60
courtyard and began returning fire as well changing yelled Mike as he stripped out an empty ammo box

1399
01:56:05.60 --> 01:56:10.56
and loaded a full one just as he closed the feed tray cover five enemy fighters moved to flank

1400
01:56:10.56 --> 01:56:15.76
Michael and his team they are flanking to the west Mike yelled as he fired at the maneuvering

1401
01:56:15.76 --> 01:56:20.32
insurgents he caught them halfway through their movement and had them pinned behind a small vehicle

1402
01:56:20.32 --> 01:56:27.68
hold them there Mike JP yelled Mike could overhear the marine angler the marine air naval gunfire

1403
01:56:27.68 --> 01:56:32.64
liaison company Anglico guys on the radio setting up for a strike on the enemy fighters he had pinned

1404
01:56:32.64 --> 01:56:38.48
down cast in 30 seconds called out the controller letting the guys know the jets were 30 seconds

1405
01:56:38.48 --> 01:56:42.72
out from dropping from Michael to seem like an eternity he had the best vantage point to keep

1406
01:56:42.72 --> 01:56:47.60
the enemy where they were as the other seals and scouts were still engaging the original enemy

1407
01:56:47.60 --> 01:56:52.32
position he conserved his ammo knowing a reload may give the insurgents just enough time to maneuver

1408
01:56:52.32 --> 01:56:56.96
away from their current position which could cause the close air support strike to have to abort

1409
01:56:56.96 --> 01:57:02.88
and start over he continued to send five to eight round bursts into the vehicle one away 10 seconds

1410
01:57:02.88 --> 01:57:07.76
to impact called out the controller the dust was heavy but Michael could still see to know that

1411
01:57:07.76 --> 01:57:12.40
none of the five enemy had left the position suddenly a flash then the car ripped apart and

1412
01:57:12.40 --> 01:57:18.56
disappeared in a cloud of black and gray smoke good hit stand by for BDA stated the controller over

1413
01:57:18.56 --> 01:57:23.20
the radio the dust cleared where the sedan used to be was a crater with indistinguishable metal

1414
01:57:23.20 --> 01:57:28.08
debris and other scattered and other materials scattered in the area Michael could make out

1415
01:57:28.08 --> 01:57:33.84
three of the five enemy now lying in peculiar positions near the blast site good hits five by

1416
01:57:33.84 --> 01:57:39.68
e k i a Michael heard the controller say the original enemy position went quiet immediately

1417
01:57:39.68 --> 01:57:44.96
after the strike the seals marines and scouts maneuvered to assess and secure the building

1418
01:57:44.96 --> 01:57:49.28
the scouts entered and cleared it only to find that the enemy had left the area all right guys

1419
01:57:49.28 --> 01:57:55.76
there's nothing left here let's charlie mike said chief fortin and the seals and scouts moved

1420
01:57:55.76 --> 01:57:59.60
to reestablish their security position for the main element element

1421
01:58:02.32 --> 01:58:09.60
so that's what they were doing yeah i would get uh phone messages and where uh Michael would call

1422
01:58:09.60 --> 01:58:17.76
would miss the message just kicking back with with my bros uh send cigars critical information

1423
01:58:17.76 --> 01:58:30.40
sends cigars exactly uh there's there's there's really good examples of this throughout the book

1424
01:58:31.84 --> 01:58:36.16
another one immediately enemy fire began to hit the wall around the rooftop Michael reposition

1425
01:58:36.16 --> 01:58:40.64
toward the contact and fire the enemy were using the cover of surrounding houses effectively and

1426
01:58:40.64 --> 01:58:45.04
continued to harass the security position it was clear this was not like other attacks it was well

1427
01:58:45.04 --> 01:58:50.000
coordinated the enemy was careful not to engage from the same spot for too long and continued to

1428
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.68
maneuver and flank the rounds from mikes 48 began to eat chunks out of the corners and ledges that

1429
01:58:55.68 --> 01:59:01.04
the enemy were using his cover the short rooftop wall was beginning to degrade as well however

1430
01:59:01.04 --> 01:59:06.24
and bullets were penetrating the plaster in some areas the men stayed low and continued to engage

1431
01:59:06.24 --> 01:59:10.88
Michael was glad he had prepped his extra ammo ahead of time it looked as though he would be

1432
01:59:10.88 --> 01:59:15.60
needing it soon Michael and the other seals on the rooftop were not the only ones taking fire

1433
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:20.000
the iraqi army scouts were trying to exit the house to maneuver on the insurgents but were

1434
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.04
pinned inside every time one of the scouts tried to exit the house a hail of bullets hit the area

1435
01:59:25.04 --> 01:59:29.44
around the exit on the rooftop the situation was not improving and it looked like ammunition might

1436
01:59:29.44 --> 01:59:34.80
soon become a problem not for Michael he continued to engage multiple enemy positions stopping only

1437
01:59:34.80 --> 01:59:42.24
to reload and reposition Mikey how's your ammo yell JP I'm good to go damn bro carrying all that

1438
01:59:42.24 --> 01:59:48.08
extra weight might save all our lives JP smiled but he was really dead serious Michael's 48 continued

1439
01:59:48.08 --> 01:59:53.04
to eat away at enemy positions an indistinct yell came from the right Michael turned to see one of

1440
01:59:53.04 --> 01:59:57.92
the enemy insurgents trying to cross the street towards the seals positions he sent a burst and

1441
01:59:57.92 --> 02:00:02.96
the enemy fighter fell against the hop pavement motionless with this the momentum changed and

1442
02:00:02.96 --> 02:00:08.56
Michael moved from position to position engaging the enemy on three sides he was the only AW gunner

1443
02:00:08.56 --> 02:00:14.88
on the roof and although the other seals were holding their own as well the 556 millimeter

1444
02:00:14.88 --> 02:00:20.80
m4 doesn't have quite the same effect as a 762 millimeter belt fed machine gun the enemy was

1445
02:00:20.80 --> 02:00:26.64
losing and it began to show the volume of fire had drastically decreased and was much more sporadic

1446
02:00:26.64 --> 02:00:31.44
until only one enemy position was still active the seals and scouts concentrated fire on the spot

1447
02:00:31.44 --> 02:00:37.44
the area went quiet and the big men waited for another attack but it never came in all Michael

1448
02:00:37.44 --> 02:00:42.24
had fired more than 600 rounds of ammunition and was likely the reason that the security position

1449
02:00:42.24 --> 02:00:47.44
was not overrun seven enemy lay dead without one seal or scout injured

1450
02:00:50.24 --> 02:00:55.84
a lot of rounds yeah I don't know I think I've told you this story before but I was so I went

1451
02:00:55.84 --> 02:01:00.64
over to Kregor to check in on everybody and as soon as I get there was like hey go watch my

1452
02:01:00.64 --> 02:01:07.84
go watch Mikey's video so I'm like cool so I go over I'm like you know go to Mikey's palace

1453
02:01:08.88 --> 02:01:13.04
which is his little room you know he's got I don't know yet some kind of like red curtain

1454
02:01:13.04 --> 02:01:17.84
right orange yeah those are orange I don't know what he probably took them from a house out in

1455
02:01:17.84 --> 02:01:23.36
town his brother sent him to him oh there you go he goes we're saying so I think this will fit

1456
02:01:23.36 --> 02:01:31.36
but yeah so I go in there and and I'm like Mikey let me see your video and you know he gets out

1457
02:01:31.36 --> 02:01:35.44
and he's just showing it to me on his he had a camera a video camera and but you know this is

1458
02:01:35.44 --> 02:01:38.64
when the video cameras had just started to have their own little screens and their own little

1459
02:01:38.64 --> 02:01:44.72
speakers so I'm watching it and this is the famous video at least it's famous in our task unit where

1460
02:01:44.72 --> 02:01:49.04
Mikey's like filming there's freaking everyone shooting there's bullets flying everywhere

1461
02:01:49.04 --> 02:01:53.60
and then Mikey turns the video camera back at himself and he says it's the moolab which was

1462
02:01:55.20 --> 02:02:00.48
oh you haven't seen that oh man we got to get that to you yeah so Mikey's filming this firefight

1463
02:02:01.52 --> 02:02:06.32
and as he's filming you know it's a pretty good firefight and then he turns the camera back at

1464
02:02:06.32 --> 02:02:12.16
himself and he's got a big smile on his face and he goes it's the moolab or welcome to the

1465
02:02:12.16 --> 02:02:16.16
moolab or something like that which the the district was called the moolab district but he

1466
02:02:16.16 --> 02:02:22.24
says it's the moolab and so I'm watching it you know I'm I'm like mr. serious and so I'm but I'm

1467
02:02:22.24 --> 02:02:26.000
trying to hold back but I'm smiling and then he gets done and he's looking at me and I look at him

1468
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:32.64
I go I go bro what are you doing filming when there's a freaking gunfight going on and he looks at me

1469
02:02:32.64 --> 02:02:39.28
and he goes I was Winchester sir which means he was out of ammo so he'd already dumped like a he

1470
02:02:39.28 --> 02:02:43.76
dumped a thousand rounds or probably 800 to a thousand rounds of ammunition didn't have any ammo

1471
02:02:43.76 --> 02:02:51.12
left and says like well I might as well make some videos but yeah I mean it's when I got home I remember

1472
02:02:51.12 --> 02:02:57.04
I was talking to some of the Vietnam SEALs and I went and talked to one Vietnam SEAL that was a

1473
02:02:57.04 --> 02:03:04.56
machine gunner Vietnam and you know I said I said you know how many like how many engagements did

1474
02:03:04.56 --> 02:03:12.000
you get in and he said oh you know we did whatever it was he said you know we did 82 operations and

1475
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.40
we got seven gunfights I said how many times did you use all your ammunition he's never

1476
02:03:19.36 --> 02:03:24.96
and here was I mean there was all machine gunners would run out of ammo on a not a fairly regular

1477
02:03:24.96 --> 02:03:29.76
but definitely ran out of ammo because that's the that was the scenario that was the situation on the

1478
02:03:29.76 --> 02:03:37.12
ground and that's why he would take less water he always took just what he hoped he could you know

1479
02:03:37.12 --> 02:03:42.56
need and he would substitute the water for ammo yeah and he'd be carrying radio sometimes too

1480
02:03:42.56 --> 02:03:43.84
yeah which is carrying a load

1481
02:03:47.20 --> 02:03:51.84
yes it's a humor oh yeah it's the mood love I can't believe you haven't seen that video

1482
02:03:51.84 --> 02:04:00.48
oh it's freaking classic uh meanwhile well that's going on back to the book hey dad it's Mike

1483
02:04:00.48 --> 02:04:04.40
Michael spoke happily into a satellite phone he'd just returned from an op-ed after showering and

1484
02:04:04.40 --> 02:04:09.44
changing in his gear he dialed home to check in Mikey how you doing I'm doing good dad we're still

1485
02:04:09.44 --> 02:04:15.20
training Iraqi forces I'm pretty bored here yeah what's new at home Michael's careful not to detail

1486
02:04:15.20 --> 02:04:19.52
the true nature of the work they conduct on a daily basis he didn't want his parents to worry he

1487
02:04:19.52 --> 02:04:25.52
preferred to keep the amount of danger they faced to himself as George and Michael discussed his gear

1488
02:04:25.52 --> 02:04:30.56
and weapons Sally walked over to George she was eager to hear Michael's voice she had barely spoken

1489
02:04:30.56 --> 02:04:34.32
to him since he left because every time he called she made sure her children and husband had ample

1490
02:04:34.32 --> 02:04:39.76
time with Michael on the phone first she was also busy finishing up a master's degree in counseling

1491
02:04:39.76 --> 02:04:45.04
marriage and family therapy so any amount of time she had to speak with Michael she treasured

1492
02:04:45.60 --> 02:04:51.92
Michael never discussed any of his combat operations with her she knew he wanted to protect her

1493
02:04:51.92 --> 02:04:56.88
from worrying but she also knew better she had walked past the hallway when her sons were on

1494
02:04:56.88 --> 02:05:00.56
their computer looking at photos of Michael patrolling through the streets and she instantly

1495
02:05:00.56 --> 02:05:07.84
knew he was facing grave enemy day in and day out she couldn't be there but she could pray and

1496
02:05:07.84 --> 02:05:13.20
that's what she did she prayed the rosary a collection of prayers based on the life of Christ

1497
02:05:13.20 --> 02:05:18.56
and honoring his blessed mother whom warfighters have credited assisting them in epic battles

1498
02:05:18.56 --> 02:05:25.44
throughout history Sally wasn't seeking anything grand with her prayers she simply requested

1499
02:05:25.44 --> 02:05:31.20
protection for her son as she prayed it every single day it was now Sally's turn to speak to

1500
02:05:31.20 --> 02:05:36.000
Michael and she held the phone tightly to her ear so she could hear her son clearly how are you

1501
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.16
Mike I miss you did you receive the care packages we sent to you we really enjoyed making them for

1502
02:05:40.16 --> 02:05:45.04
you and your teammates they were great mom thank you even the package full of female toiletries

1503
02:05:45.04 --> 02:05:50.80
you and your friends threw in there yeah these she had these women volunteers and they did other

1504
02:05:50.80 --> 02:05:57.68
charity work and they sent stuff and so nobody knows how that got in there but Mike says you

1505
02:05:57.68 --> 02:06:05.60
guys had kind of a crazy look when they open that one up like are women coming yeah the

1506
02:06:07.44 --> 02:06:12.72
so my wife is at home she got three kids they're like how old were they they were like maybe seven

1507
02:06:13.76 --> 02:06:17.68
five and three or something like this they're maybe you know six four and two or something like

1508
02:06:17.68 --> 02:06:21.44
this so she doesn't have time to do all this stuff so finally I get you know everyone's getting a

1509
02:06:21.44 --> 02:06:26.32
care package all this nice stuff I'm not getting anything finally like two months into pulling

1510
02:06:26.32 --> 02:06:32.56
it I get a package and I still harassed my wife about this I like honey roasted peanuts right

1511
02:06:32.56 --> 02:06:37.92
and so she sent me a planters thing of honey roasted peanuts but it was open and tape shot

1512
02:06:38.48 --> 02:06:43.84
open it was half eaten with the kids got into it it was tape shot that's what I got I'm like thanks

1513
02:06:43.84 --> 02:06:51.12
darlin but I did never get women's toiletries yeah no one figured out where those came from but

1514
02:06:52.08 --> 02:06:57.60
they got a lot of women's magazines too from people because I would contact anybody that would

1515
02:06:57.60 --> 02:07:04.48
send things we sent stuff and people volunteers send stuff and I you know it was just crazy

1516
02:07:05.04 --> 02:07:09.92
guys would risk their lives go out and get those packages you know hey women toiletries

1517
02:07:09.92 --> 02:07:17.36
just what we need uh he says I'm gonna go head to bed now I want to say hello to you guys

1518
02:07:17.36 --> 02:07:21.20
Mike's voice began to drift off the day his operation had begun to hit him like a wall his

1519
02:07:21.20 --> 02:07:25.44
body was now just registering need for sleep of course take care of yourself we're all okay here

1520
02:07:25.44 --> 02:07:30.88
Michael stay focused so you can come home safe Sally said those words became her parting words

1521
02:07:30.88 --> 02:07:42.64
every time she spoke to him stay focused so you can come home safe we would lie in bed just kind

1522
02:07:42.64 --> 02:07:50.96
of looking at the ceiling and saw with say we all know that he's just not kicking back you know it's

1523
02:07:50.96 --> 02:07:58.96
kind of a charade here you know but we were pretty aware what was how bad Ramadi was but we knew he

1524
02:07:58.96 --> 02:08:05.20
didn't really want to get into it so we kept the conversations pretty light now when Mark got killed

1525
02:08:05.20 --> 02:08:10.56
did you guys did you guys become aware when Mark got killed went to the funeral and that's where

1526
02:08:12.08 --> 02:08:22.64
Sally met Matt Debbie Debbie but also I put you know I keep thinking Kay

1527
02:08:22.64 --> 02:08:30.96
uh oh oh from the book yeah Matt Cowie McCowie got it Cowie comes up to her in his crutches

1528
02:08:31.84 --> 02:08:38.80
and says Michael saved my life Michael saved my life and that's when Sal was thinking how could

1529
02:08:38.80 --> 02:08:45.44
you save your life if he's just marching people around and then he told her the story and that's

1530
02:08:45.44 --> 02:08:54.56
why it was like yeah we know a little bit better than that but and of course we had a conversation

1531
02:08:54.56 --> 02:09:02.72
I remind him we don't we don't really need heroes just do a good job and uh this is don't worry

1532
02:09:05.36 --> 02:09:14.72
if I remember him saying uh we talked about his death about Lee's death and everything and

1533
02:09:14.72 --> 02:09:20.96
those guys took it pretty hard and he and I said we feel gonna be careful and he goes don't worry

1534
02:09:20.96 --> 02:09:30.24
he says if I go here I will be the one that decides I still remember that especially when he he didn't

1535
02:09:30.24 --> 02:09:38.88
have to we could have gotten out of that he decided and just always sticks in my head that conversation

1536
02:09:38.88 --> 02:09:51.36
yeah I know that uh I mean my wife had no idea of what was going on um at all and but then no

1537
02:09:51.36 --> 02:09:58.08
because she didn't even give you a full can that's true that's true I'd say she has no clue but you

1538
02:09:58.08 --> 02:10:03.84
know even Cowie got Cowie got wounded but you know she just I think she just thought it was anomaly

1539
02:10:03.84 --> 02:10:08.56
and and like I said I mean she had um she had a you know she had three kids going on freaking young

1540
02:10:08.56 --> 02:10:16.80
kids and everything but uh I think everybody when Mark got killed it was like oh wake up yeah and and

1541
02:10:18.56 --> 02:10:23.44
yeah it's I was looking through my emails a while ago which is crazy to look through emails and I

1542
02:10:23.44 --> 02:10:30.40
have like all the emails I was reading emails that I sent my wife and you know it's like oh uh what is

1543
02:10:30.40 --> 02:10:42.96
it July 29th you know um then July 1st or so July 31st and then August 2nd that's the day Mark died

1544
02:10:42.96 --> 02:10:48.56
and there's you know my you know I sent an email August 3rd like hey hope everything's okay you know

1545
02:10:48.56 --> 02:10:54.000
something like this but still nothing um and I think that was everybody you know kind of like

1546
02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.96
what Mikey was doing is so you just don't want people to worry but then that was just uh no way

1547
02:10:58.96 --> 02:11:06.16
to hide that you know what we saw Cowie again uh we invited some of the sales for Thanksgiving

1548
02:11:07.04 --> 02:11:14.96
and uh we still didn't know the whole story and then the Thanksgiving he says uh so can I talk to you

1549
02:11:14.96 --> 02:11:21.68
and they went into another room and he says let me tell you what I saw and then he pulls up his shirt

1550
02:11:21.68 --> 02:11:30.16
and he has that huge tattoo because this is what I swear this is what I saw so it was like you know

1551
02:11:30.80 --> 02:11:40.000
yeah yeah so Cowie who is uh wasn't asking a bruiser and was just a freaking awesome guy

1552
02:11:41.28 --> 02:11:49.28
that's the the opening story is Mikey dragging him out of the out of the street and he ended up

1553
02:11:49.28 --> 02:11:59.44
getting a tattoo of of Mikey with these angels wings it's Cowie was telling the story the other

1554
02:11:59.44 --> 02:12:06.32
day and one thing I he was saying it was like he was about to say something like he or maybe he was

1555
02:12:06.32 --> 02:12:11.20
like hey I need and as soon as he was saying I need help like he felt Mikey's hand like grab his

1556
02:12:11.76 --> 02:12:18.16
gear and start pulling him he was like that's Johnny on the spot right there yeah yeah I'm

1557
02:12:18.16 --> 02:12:24.40
I'm not that I'm not real religious but things like this just hit me and sometimes like I don't

1558
02:12:24.40 --> 02:12:30.16
know I don't have explanations for some of these things that uh I think the older you get you start

1559
02:12:30.16 --> 02:12:35.44
to see more things there just uh can't really explain but

1560
02:12:40.80 --> 02:12:45.28
it was the 15th of August the the Iraqi army along with the U.S. Army would be conducting

1561
02:12:45.28 --> 02:12:51.76
clearance of another portion of the Malab district the houses were tightly packed and clearance would

1562
02:12:51.76 --> 02:12:57.12
likely be slow the seals came prepared and were all set with cardboard shade water and a ton of

1563
02:12:57.12 --> 02:13:01.28
extra ammunition the men didn't know it but they would soon have no need for the shade

1564
02:13:01.28 --> 02:13:06.32
as the call to prayer ended Michael scan the surrounding area with his periscope he glanced

1565
02:13:06.32 --> 02:13:11.52
over to see his teammates to the right each with their own as well he smiled and continued to scan

1566
02:13:11.52 --> 02:13:16.72
it it worked out so well for Michael that a bunch of guys had had them sent out this is Michael

1567
02:13:16.72 --> 02:13:21.52
ended up getting his like combat periscopes which ended up being awesome yeah I remember

1568
02:13:22.08 --> 02:13:28.64
Sarah I was uh was sending that out just looking at me like like really playing games over there

1569
02:13:28.64 --> 02:13:32.64
yeah imagine how nice it is when you don't have to poke your head up over a wall yeah

1570
02:13:33.84 --> 02:13:38.16
nothing to see here guys just the Iraqi army and dudes getting unloaded Michael called then the

1571
02:13:38.16 --> 02:13:43.28
loudspeakers crackled on that's weird thought Michael it seemed as though the prayers were going

1572
02:13:43.28 --> 02:13:47.92
to start again a voice came over the loudspeakers but it sounded different this time it was not the

1573
02:13:47.92 --> 02:13:53.84
usual singing it was speaking and the words were different what is that are they praying again that

1574
02:13:53.84 --> 02:13:58.88
doesn't sound like prayer chief Fortin said I know it's not the same Michael responded the interpreter

1575
02:13:58.88 --> 02:14:04.96
burst through the couple a door and onto the roof its directions they're being direct directed he

1576
02:14:04.96 --> 02:14:10.96
blurted what who asked chief Fortin the speakers the enemy fighters are being directed on where to

1577
02:14:10.96 --> 02:14:20.72
go the interpreter replied oh well shit oh well shit JP Doug Mike do you have a shot to take out

1578
02:14:20.72 --> 02:14:26.08
those speakers chief called chief Fortin but the snipers had already been trying to work a solution

1579
02:14:26.08 --> 02:14:31.12
no joy chief was the response Mikey I hope you brought a lot of ammo shits probably gonna get real

1580
02:14:31.12 --> 02:14:41.68
stupid real quick chief Fortin said always Mikey replied was that was that the 12 hour

1581
02:14:45.36 --> 02:14:50.96
yeah yeah that one what ends up happening comms chatter but most it was not pertinent to Michael

1582
02:14:50.96 --> 02:14:56.32
most of the information flow from different units leaders back to to the joint operation center

1583
02:14:56.32 --> 02:15:00.40
where the operation is being monitored Michael's concern was keeping the enemy pinned and if one

1584
02:15:00.40 --> 02:15:04.80
of them was brave enough to try and move out in the open dropping in in his tracks the clearance

1585
02:15:04.80 --> 02:15:09.36
was ongoing but the insurgents currently attacking the seal position were relentless and I fast

1586
02:15:09.36 --> 02:15:14.72
forwarded to this they're they just basically got like an all out assault this was not ideal but

1587
02:15:14.72 --> 02:15:18.72
also meant that they were not trying to advance towards the overwatch position had been hours

1588
02:15:18.72 --> 02:15:23.60
and neither side could get the upper hand Michael moved from position a position firing at multiple

1589
02:15:23.60 --> 02:15:28.40
enemy locations it looked as though this fight was not going to be over anytime soon and he

1590
02:15:28.40 --> 02:15:34.48
wasn't wrong the entire engagement lasted 12 hours I mean imagine people have never served

1591
02:15:36.08 --> 02:15:44.16
12 hours I mean it's the way these guys stay together and then the next day they go up and do

1592
02:15:44.16 --> 02:15:51.60
it again it's the people I just don't it's just it's just remarkable what these guys do yeah you know

1593
02:15:51.60 --> 02:15:58.48
a lot of times you know people talk about basic seal training they talk about buds oh buds was

1594
02:15:58.48 --> 02:16:05.44
hard and I look it is hard it's hard as hell and it's a nightmare for guys to try and get through

1595
02:16:06.72 --> 02:16:12.64
but what you just talked about and what I usually try and explain to people is oh you

1596
02:16:12.64 --> 02:16:21.92
saw an army guy get killed you were in a firefight yesterday you had rounds snapped by your head you

1597
02:16:21.92 --> 02:16:28.96
had like all these things happen I mean on some of these engagements uh their JP dragged a marine

1598
02:16:28.96 --> 02:16:35.20
out of the street I will I forget the number but the marine got shot another marine got shot

1599
02:16:35.20 --> 02:16:42.08
an Iraqi got shot a seal got shot through his backpack through his uh water bladder his camel

1600
02:16:42.08 --> 02:16:51.44
back on his so it's like in one little engagement five people got shot and what do you do the next

1601
02:16:51.44 --> 02:16:59.04
day you go out again yeah and then the next day you go out again so yeah the look buds is hard I get

1602
02:16:59.04 --> 02:17:04.40
it but this stuff right here and look it's not just seals the Marines are going out every day the

1603
02:17:04.40 --> 02:17:11.12
army's going out every day and everyone's taking those risks and that's why the bond was so tight

1604
02:17:11.12 --> 02:17:16.56
with the army and the Marine Corps in Ramadi because everyone was doing everything we could

1605
02:17:16.56 --> 02:17:25.20
to protect each other and that's why that bond was and is so strong yeah yeah I read some of uh

1606
02:17:26.64 --> 02:17:37.12
Michael's emails uh and I was his friends in the States crying that uh his girlfriend their

1607
02:17:37.12 --> 02:17:42.72
girlfriend doesn't love him anymore or her boyfriend laughed and they're having a tough time in

1608
02:17:42.72 --> 02:17:48.32
college and I'm and Mike writes back you know encouraging them and the whole deal and I'm

1609
02:17:48.32 --> 02:18:02.56
thinking really they're having a tough time yeah yeah it's uh it it definitely is and that's what

1610
02:18:02.56 --> 02:18:07.44
I love about this book is you start to realize the I mean this is what the daily life is like

1611
02:18:08.64 --> 02:18:13.76
captured it really really well and that's I think that's important for people to read these type of

1612
02:18:13.76 --> 02:18:20.96
books uh I can get a taste and these these stories as you said they're from uh the guys that were

1613
02:18:20.96 --> 02:18:29.28
there these stories are real and uh I think it would give uh the rest of the country just kind of a

1614
02:18:29.28 --> 02:18:35.44
fingernail sketch of what these guys go through and also if you have you know uh teenage

1615
02:18:36.40 --> 02:18:42.24
children they can see that guys like Michael they're just like them they they have problems when

1616
02:18:42.24 --> 02:18:48.24
they're kids and they deal with bullies and it's that determination and that strength that you build

1617
02:18:48.24 --> 02:18:56.000
up in your life that prepares you for the world yeah and uh you know the fact that the first time

1618
02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:03.04
Mikey went to Bud's he quit yeah and you know who else did Mark Lee Mark Lee the first time he went

1619
02:19:03.04 --> 02:19:09.84
to Bud's he quit and I always uh you know occasionally I'll talk to someone that's that had been to

1620
02:19:09.84 --> 02:19:15.52
Bud's and quit and I usually tell them if they seem like they're a good person I'll say if they

1621
02:19:15.52 --> 02:19:19.28
say they want to go back and I'll say hey you're at a Mikey Montsourne they say yeah I'm gonna go

1622
02:19:19.28 --> 02:19:23.84
Mikey Montsour quit the first time he went and now I'm gonna be able to tell him but when you get

1623
02:19:23.84 --> 02:19:30.16
defeated it's what you do it's what's the quote I gotta learn it's how you come back from the feet

1624
02:19:30.16 --> 02:19:34.48
come back from the feet so that's what I'm talking about so that's the man we're gonna add that in

1625
02:19:34.48 --> 02:19:39.52
there whatever it is it's the way you come back it's always wake up because we've all had losses

1626
02:19:39.52 --> 02:19:46.64
and for me when I have a bad loss uh it just burns them burns it's there forever you sometimes you

1627
02:19:46.64 --> 02:19:52.48
forget about those easy wins but you remember those losses and usually hopefully you'll walk away

1628
02:19:52.48 --> 02:20:00.56
with a lesson and uh Michael just when that happened I just didn't surprise me at all he was coming

1629
02:20:00.56 --> 02:20:08.40
back he will win yeah so pushing a little bit further into deployment we're getting towards

1630
02:20:08.40 --> 02:20:12.16
the end of deployment Michael gripped the phone close to his mouth hey dad we're just about done

1631
02:20:12.16 --> 02:20:17.92
here I volunteered to stay for a few more operations so one of the guys could leave early his wife is

1632
02:20:17.92 --> 02:20:22.88
having a baby soon it won't be long I expect to be finished up in about a week I'll also be helping

1633
02:20:22.88 --> 02:20:28.24
do to do turnover with the incoming team then I'm heading out my stuff is packed and ready to go

1634
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:34.96
that's great news Mikey your mom and I can't wait to see you we're gonna celebrate and have a big

1635
02:20:34.96 --> 02:20:39.76
party when you get backstage side George felt a great relief to learn that Mikey was so close to

1636
02:20:39.76 --> 02:20:46.08
coming home and almost silly for having thought that he may not see his son again take care of yourself

1637
02:20:46.08 --> 02:20:55.36
and we'll see you soon and that's something you told me uh oh a little while ago was that Mikey

1638
02:20:55.36 --> 02:21:00.000
was always telling you about who's married and checking in on who has kids and that was a big

1639
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:07.44
concern is was he knew who had kids who was married and he he would tell me I worry about these guys

1640
02:21:07.44 --> 02:21:14.16
he goes I don't want to be the guy that lost one of these uh one of these guys who has children

1641
02:21:14.16 --> 02:21:22.88
because he believed fathers mothers is you know a two-person deal and uh he's always loved kids and

1642
02:21:22.88 --> 02:21:30.88
he just would be so bothered knowing that on his watch somebody lost the father and he would talk

1643
02:21:30.88 --> 02:21:36.72
about I mean I mean people really want to find out who's got kids in there but he he would want to

1644
02:21:36.72 --> 02:21:43.52
know and he would keep keep it in the back of his mind so I know it always concerned him because he

1645
02:21:43.52 --> 02:21:54.48
just didn't want to lose a father it was the 28th of September and the first of the 506 had one last

1646
02:21:54.48 --> 02:22:00.48
request Operation Kentucky Jumper the SEALs would be providing overwatch for Combat Outpost Eagle's

1647
02:22:00.48 --> 02:22:05.68
Nest while the external wall of the Combat Outpost was being reinforced in addition the first of

1648
02:22:05.68 --> 02:22:09.84
the 506 would be conducting a clearance in the same area which the SEALs would cover as well

1649
02:22:09.84 --> 02:22:15.44
the insert would take place at night the two elements would leave cop eagles nest and set up

1650
02:22:15.44 --> 02:22:20.96
mutually supporting rooftop overwatch positions in two prominent houses much like they had been

1651
02:22:20.96 --> 02:22:25.84
doing for the entire deployment the men had conducted this type of operation many times and

1652
02:22:25.84 --> 02:22:40.64
at this point it seemed like this one would be much the same so they push in they do this overwatch

1653
02:22:40.64 --> 02:22:45.52
around 11 a.m the army moved out of the area having finished operations for the day the SEAL

1654
02:22:45.52 --> 02:22:50.64
overwatch positions remained in place and would extract under the cover of darkness later that

1655
02:22:50.64 --> 02:22:56.88
night other than the first of the 506 doing clearance ops and us being in the area providing

1656
02:22:56.88 --> 02:23:01.28
overwatch it was kind of a somber day Doug said referring to how the day was going in comparison

1657
02:23:01.28 --> 02:23:07.04
to other similar operations they had completed based on most of the previous operations the

1658
02:23:07.04 --> 02:23:11.04
likelihood of the firefight was low of another firefight was low the temperature was reaching

1659
02:23:11.04 --> 02:23:16.64
115 degrees and they would stay there until late in the afternoon and only begin to cool when the

1660
02:23:16.64 --> 02:23:24.72
sun dip below the horizon as the morning turned into day and then early afternoon Michael Doug

1661
02:23:24.72 --> 02:23:31.92
and Mike S talked of heading home and what was next for each of them there was a sense of excitement

1662
02:23:31.92 --> 02:23:36.80
we were proud of what we did we were proud of our relationships we had built with the army in the

1663
02:23:36.80 --> 02:23:42.80
Marine Corps recalls Mike Surrelly the men talked of their families Doug would be headed back to

1664
02:23:42.80 --> 02:23:48.48
Georgia to see his three sons Mike S was ready to get back to his two-year-old little girl

1665
02:23:48.48 --> 02:23:54.48
Michael listened as the guy spoke of heading home he was ready as well sniper school heading into

1666
02:23:54.48 --> 02:23:59.04
his next platoon snowboarding trips and driving up the coast to see his family in Garden Grove

1667
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:05.60
Doug recalls how cool and relaxed Michael was he just had a real calming sense to him

1668
02:24:06.64 --> 02:24:12.08
you could tell instantly what a great person and warrior he was to this point it was the most one

1669
02:24:12.08 --> 02:24:22.16
on one time Doug had spent with Michael as the day continued on the intense heat had begun to wear on

1670
02:24:22.16 --> 02:24:28.08
the men the shade material help but not but the heat radiated from surfaces all around them not

1671
02:24:28.08 --> 02:24:33.92
even the light breeze brought reprieve the air was stifling dry and filled with dust the lack of

1672
02:24:33.92 --> 02:24:42.80
activity and the heat induced lethargy degrading the men's awareness boom an explosion rocked the

1673
02:24:42.80 --> 02:24:52.08
rooftop Michael ran back over to the position between Mike S and Doug what was that RPG asked Doug

1674
02:24:52.08 --> 02:24:57.36
sure seemed like it Mike S replied the anger on Michael's face was apparent as he searched for the

1675
02:24:57.36 --> 02:25:01.92
insurgent responsible for the attack Mike S moved out of his loophole and called the other element

1676
02:25:01.92 --> 02:25:07.60
we just took an RPG searching for the shooter now what have you guys got Doug rolled into the open

1677
02:25:07.60 --> 02:25:13.68
spot as it had a better field of view than his loophole Michael sat on the chair between the two

1678
02:25:13.68 --> 02:25:19.76
with his mark 48 resting on the wall of the rooftop Mike S continued updating the other element while

1679
02:25:19.76 --> 02:25:27.92
Michael Doug and Benny scan the area they saw nothing no enemy movement suddenly an object

1680
02:25:27.92 --> 02:25:32.80
just barely cleared the lip of the wall and hit Michael in the chest it bounced off and rolled

1681
02:25:32.80 --> 02:25:39.12
to the ground directly in front of him Mike S looked over at what had just landed next to the

1682
02:25:39.12 --> 02:25:44.88
group then up at Michael Michael stood so quickly and with such force that the chair he was sitting

1683
02:25:44.88 --> 02:25:51.92
on sailed across the rooftop and impacted the opposite wall Michael looked at Mike S and yelled

1684
02:25:51.92 --> 02:26:00.24
grenade Mike S watched in disbelief as Michael the only one of them who had an out to escape the

1685
02:26:00.24 --> 02:26:11.44
blast instead lunged forward dropping directly onto the grenade Seth's element had heard and seen

1686
02:26:11.44 --> 02:26:16.80
the two blasts from their overwatch position and were already moving when the call for help came in

1687
02:26:16.80 --> 02:26:21.28
the men urgently picked up the pace when they heard the amount of enemy automatic weapon fire that

1688
02:26:21.28 --> 02:26:26.24
their friends were receiving they broke out from the main house the main entrance and headed west

1689
02:26:26.24 --> 02:26:30.48
initially it was all quiet at their position but within 15 seconds of hitting the street all

1690
02:26:30.48 --> 02:26:35.76
hell broke loose enemy rounds snapped and skipped around them they moved from cover to cover returning

1691
02:26:35.76 --> 02:26:40.72
fires they closed the distance to the other overwatch position they were only two blocks away

1692
02:26:40.72 --> 02:26:45.12
but to the wounded seals it seemed like it took forever for the other element to arrive

1693
02:26:45.12 --> 02:26:52.88
hold on Mikey hold on Mike S said as he and Doug continued to assess and aid Michael suddenly a

1694
02:26:52.88 --> 02:26:59.20
seal from the other element burst onto the roof and headed over to Doug Mike S and Michael he was

1695
02:26:59.20 --> 02:27:03.84
followed by Seth and the other seals one of the strongest seals grabbed Michael and hoisted him

1696
02:27:03.84 --> 02:27:11.92
onto his back Seth grabbed Doug and the others took Mike S they could hear the 25 millimeter

1697
02:27:11.92 --> 02:27:16.72
auto cannons of the Bradley fighting vehicles begin to fire effectively suppressing the enemy

1698
02:27:18.64 --> 02:27:21.36
and providing cover for the seals to load their wounded

1699
02:27:26.80 --> 02:27:30.88
Mike S directed the group as they moved down the stairs and into the alley to the waiting

1700
02:27:30.88 --> 02:27:36.24
Bradley's Doug Mike S and Michael were loaded onto the into the back along with one of the seals

1701
02:27:36.24 --> 02:27:42.32
from the other element he stayed to continue to aid Michael while the Bradley's extracted them

1702
02:27:42.32 --> 02:27:49.84
and headed back to Camp Corregidor when the wounded seals arrived they saw the men from the

1703
02:27:49.84 --> 02:27:54.96
first the 506 lined up waiting to support whatever they could another testament to the bond that

1704
02:27:54.96 --> 02:28:01.20
the two units and shared Doug Mike S and Michael were loaded onto stretchers and brought into the

1705
02:28:01.20 --> 02:28:07.52
aid station on the camp Doug and Mike S were given shots of morphine for the first time

1706
02:28:07.52 --> 02:28:14.24
since the grenade explosion they finally had reprieve from the physical piercing pain the

1707
02:28:14.24 --> 02:28:20.40
reprieve however was short lived the atmosphere in the room shifted the mood had darkened and the

1708
02:28:20.40 --> 02:28:30.48
two men could feel it then they overheard the nurse say it Michael was gone and that sobering

1709
02:28:30.48 --> 02:28:37.12
moment they became aware of what Michael had given them he had freely exchanged his life for theirs

1710
02:28:40.08 --> 02:28:47.28
it was September 29th the feast day of st. Michael the art a arch angle the arch angel

1711
02:28:48.08 --> 02:28:54.88
the protector and guide of warfighters since time immemorial and whom Michael had been named

1712
02:28:54.88 --> 02:29:01.68
25 years earlier

1713
02:29:03.68 --> 02:29:05.36
it was a bad day for the family

1714
02:29:08.24 --> 02:29:10.88
remember Jim called me to hear him crying

1715
02:29:13.20 --> 02:29:19.68
dad is bad it's bad i said what's bad he says

1716
02:29:19.68 --> 02:29:28.08
uh Michael Michael died from Monty please get ahold of Joe

1717
02:29:29.76 --> 02:29:32.64
tried to call Joe and i finally got ahold of him he was uh

1718
02:29:33.44 --> 02:29:42.32
playing football in north dakota and uh i couldn't even tell him finally got ahold of him i couldn't

1719
02:29:42.32 --> 02:29:50.96
even tell him i couldn't even talk i said just call your brother and i guess when sal saw him at

1720
02:29:50.96 --> 02:30:03.44
the door the navy she just knew it was a bad day i just uh because we you had that call that says

1721
02:30:03.44 --> 02:30:12.40
i'm coming home so now it's like all your planning is what we're going to do when we get together uh

1722
02:30:14.48 --> 02:30:15.28
didn't happen

1723
02:30:20.48 --> 02:30:29.92
i uh well so i had been tracking the operation i was in the tactical operation center and and it

1724
02:30:29.92 --> 02:30:35.68
was troops in contact which was like like i said this was like a almost daily occurrence that guys

1725
02:30:35.68 --> 02:30:42.96
would be in there and then you know you got you hear wounded and now all of a sudden that's not

1726
02:30:42.96 --> 02:30:50.88
common and um the kazovaks get called and i can hear some of the radio calls and i i end up redirecting

1727
02:30:50.88 --> 02:30:58.96
the kazovak to their location and and finally it was actually colonel carc god bless him

1728
02:30:58.96 --> 02:31:02.56
um he he called me and um

1729
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.04
yeah he told me uh

1730
02:31:19.68 --> 02:31:25.76
he told me uh serelli and dug he said they were they were wounded but they're going to be all right

1731
02:31:25.76 --> 02:31:33.68
he said benny was going to be okay he said that serelli and and and dug we're going to be for

1732
02:31:33.68 --> 02:31:39.36
you know getting flown out and he said and he said mikey wasn't going to make it

1733
02:31:47.28 --> 02:31:47.92
and um

1734
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:57.60
um i mean we sent guys to escort mikey home and i mean we still had to finish deployment we still

1735
02:31:57.60 --> 02:32:08.16
had to turn over with the next guys and and thankfully andrew paul he's the guy that that

1736
02:32:08.16 --> 02:32:13.76
had come home early yeah mike really ate them so he could have his wife could have the baby

1737
02:32:13.76 --> 02:32:21.52
and so he knew i mean obviously he was mikey's you know assistant platoon commander with seth and

1738
02:32:22.08 --> 02:32:31.12
and and thankfully he was home so that he could be there but i mean as soon i talked to seth seth

1739
02:32:31.12 --> 02:32:36.64
and seth had to go back out into town by the way they got back and seth had to go back

1740
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.56
into the city because they left their iraqis there they left a bunch of gear there and so

1741
02:32:42.56 --> 02:32:47.52
seth had to go back out gather up their iraqis gather up all their gear come back and then he

1742
02:32:47.52 --> 02:32:55.68
called me and he immediately he he knew um he said hey mikey jumped on that mikey jumped on a grenade

1743
02:32:57.60 --> 02:33:07.76
and a few hours later i talked to uh mike and dug and they're in germany and they're like

1744
02:33:07.76 --> 02:33:19.04
hey he saved us that's the only reason we're here and um i talked to seth and seth was like

1745
02:33:19.92 --> 02:33:22.40
drafting up the medal of honor and i was like do it

1746
02:33:28.08 --> 02:33:34.24
and i remember i did when seth came to visit the house and you want to see him you know it's like

1747
02:33:34.24 --> 02:33:41.28
i've had it with you guys i only want to see it seth is hard to say no to because you can see

1748
02:33:41.28 --> 02:33:49.60
the sincerity on the space and i don't know the family we just worked it out but

1749
02:33:52.24 --> 02:33:58.72
we can cry at any moment when we think of mike that's um it's the way it is i know uh

1750
02:33:58.72 --> 02:34:09.92
uh and man sarah your daughter what a what a just awesome woman very strong very strong and i remember

1751
02:34:09.92 --> 02:34:14.96
her and i don't know she said it to me but i think i remember her seeing it later people were you

1752
02:34:14.96 --> 02:34:20.56
guys were getting interviewed she was getting interviewed and she was basically someone said

1753
02:34:20.56 --> 02:34:24.40
are you know you are you surprised that this happened and she said no anybody that knew mikey

1754
02:34:24.40 --> 02:34:30.40
is not surprised by this um

1755
02:34:33.20 --> 02:34:36.000
yeah uh

1756
02:34:40.16 --> 02:34:43.12
when at what point did you hear about the medal of honor

1757
02:34:44.96 --> 02:34:47.12
uh what happened was uh

1758
02:34:47.12 --> 02:34:55.28
uh some guy from the newspapers called us about it and i didn't know what he was talking about

1759
02:34:55.28 --> 02:35:03.84
and we hadn't gotten so many calls all kinds of things we had hate calls we had uh newspapers

1760
02:35:04.72 --> 02:35:11.84
interviews most of the stuff we said no and uh we just want to be left alone in fact we were so

1761
02:35:11.84 --> 02:35:20.16
used to getting bad calls uh i remember the president uh was trying to call us because

1762
02:35:20.16 --> 02:35:29.84
this is when they decided to award him um the medal and uh sarah kept trying to tell me um

1763
02:35:30.56 --> 02:35:36.96
would you pick up the phone and i was thinking this is i go what's this guy keeps bothering me

1764
02:35:36.96 --> 02:35:42.24
it's just the same number i don't know what this asshole wants and then she could stab would you

1765
02:35:42.24 --> 02:35:48.80
just pick up the phone you know so that's when we knew it was real because you hear people everyone

1766
02:35:48.80 --> 02:35:56.72
is talking with you you know to do this and that but i mean it's nice but it's not your son yeah you

1767
02:35:56.72 --> 02:36:07.92
know and uh it's uh it our family appreciated it but you know that hole is still there i think anyone

1768
02:36:07.92 --> 02:36:14.08
who's lost a child i don't care if it's uh in the hospital an accident there's a hole and we're in a

1769
02:36:14.08 --> 02:36:21.28
real sad family and me and debbie lee we're talking about it it's just it's just there and it just

1770
02:36:21.28 --> 02:36:27.92
hits you everyone's smile hearing kids playing the playground or something like that it just hits

1771
02:36:27.92 --> 02:36:37.68
you it's you just don't get over it but uh we were treated very very nicely surprising

1772
02:36:37.68 --> 02:36:45.28
because i was in the Marines and uh the seal family is totally different and i was kind of shocked

1773
02:36:45.28 --> 02:36:52.64
i was like almost too sorry okay well leave us alone you know but uh i was really taken back by

1774
02:36:53.76 --> 02:36:59.76
you know these guys coming over and checking on the family and it was a good thing

1775
02:37:02.32 --> 02:37:11.20
at what point did you hear about the ship i was about i remember uh dr o winter talked about

1776
02:37:11.20 --> 02:37:19.28
uh a ship and see we don't know anything about the navy uh we're not into the ceremony stuff and it

1777
02:37:19.28 --> 02:37:27.44
was like yeah okay whatever uh didn't you know uh really think about it it was just in passing we

1778
02:37:27.44 --> 02:37:35.68
thought and then a while later maybe uh six months later uh we get this thing where uh they're going

1779
02:37:35.68 --> 02:37:44.08
to name a ship after michael we had no no idea it was going to be like 10 years i mean it was just

1780
02:37:45.92 --> 02:37:52.32
incredible and it was like fly here fly there and that's why my kids were like we're not going any

1781
02:37:52.32 --> 02:38:00.48
place we didn't realize it was going to turn into a job and uh it was everything was nice and uh

1782
02:38:00.48 --> 02:38:07.12
uh but it's not something we really wanted uh we were real happy to just go back to

1783
02:38:08.08 --> 02:38:14.80
simple nobody knows this and so it was it was busy for the first couple years and finally it you

1784
02:38:14.80 --> 02:38:22.64
know it disappeared and it was okay but um oh my goodness i would think leave it to mikey

1785
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:32.08
he still got something going on and even this book people will talk to me uh we'd have a writer

1786
02:38:32.08 --> 02:38:38.16
sitting on our porch wanting to write a book and what's the hat it does and we passed on all of them

1787
02:38:39.44 --> 02:38:45.28
and then just uh when one of the sailors did a book on michael and gave it to a submissive at

1788
02:38:45.28 --> 02:38:51.84
the cemetery and that's when i started thinking my grandchildren should have a book because they

1789
02:38:51.84 --> 02:38:59.04
should see what it's like um you know they got to understand that michael uncle michael went through

1790
02:38:59.04 --> 02:39:03.68
some of the same things they went through you know it just doesn't happen you've got to have

1791
02:39:04.64 --> 02:39:09.04
you know you've got to be able to figure things out you have to be strong enough because when

1792
02:39:09.04 --> 02:39:16.000
you're a kid you're bullied or you're you know you're not sure of yourself the world is is really

1793
02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.40
scary for him and i thought it would be good that they could see their uncle had the same kind of

1794
02:39:20.40 --> 02:39:26.88
problems and he got through it and they can get through it too so and i would hope anybody who would

1795
02:39:26.88 --> 02:39:35.12
read this the same thing you know a young man or reading this realizes he's he's got a long ways to

1796
02:39:35.12 --> 02:39:43.28
go in his life and um he can pull himself together some guys uh i hired a lot of young people in my

1797
02:39:43.28 --> 02:39:50.72
time and some of them they just never got that message now they're in their 30s and 40s and

1798
02:39:50.72 --> 02:39:57.04
they're still children yeah so um yeah it's it's weird too i i i gotta admit from my perspective

1799
02:39:57.04 --> 02:40:04.88
when you talk about mikey like as a boy by the time he was in the teams which is when i met him

1800
02:40:04.88 --> 02:40:10.32
yeah he was no boy no and and and then i was telling you this before we started recording like

1801
02:40:10.32 --> 02:40:16.72
he was getting big yeah so he cut the sleeves off all the shirts everything's hard to call him

1802
02:40:16.72 --> 02:40:21.92
sleeves because he was just like getting jacked but i mean he was you know even even when we say

1803
02:40:21.92 --> 02:40:29.12
kevin lace kevin lace is a really big guy but mikey was also big so it's interesting when you

1804
02:40:29.12 --> 02:40:35.84
put it all together and like you say the arc of the book the mikey i knew was just a badass right

1805
02:40:35.84 --> 02:40:40.40
and he might have been a new guy and he might have been you know like young for the seal teams yeah

1806
02:40:41.04 --> 02:40:49.44
but he was a badass so to connect that to this guy who you know had asthma and got bullied and

1807
02:40:49.44 --> 02:40:55.92
like like while i knew mike mike was not getting bullied by anybody you know what i'm saying so he

1808
02:40:55.92 --> 02:41:05.04
had overcome all that and and and like you said um it risen up and at the same time that he had that

1809
02:41:05.04 --> 02:41:11.84
quality like there's literally no one else that you would rather have to watch your back yeah

1810
02:41:12.96 --> 02:41:21.12
no he was if if he said i've got it he meant it you know if he says you're my friend you could

1811
02:41:21.12 --> 02:41:26.88
you take it to the bank he will do everything uh that he can if you if you have a problem and i

1812
02:41:26.88 --> 02:41:34.96
remember gabe talking about how close they were gabe was uh was greek and michael being uh lobanese

1813
02:41:34.96 --> 02:41:39.76
they would he would call him his lobanese brother no they call him his Mediterranean brother

1814
02:41:41.44 --> 02:41:49.20
i'm gonna go out and choke on some olives or something i don't know uh you know this the

1815
02:41:49.20 --> 02:41:57.12
stuff with the ship um i mean it was it was i see i got to look at it from afar right i wasn't

1816
02:41:57.12 --> 02:42:02.48
all mixed up in it like you guys were flying all the time yeah uh you guys the keel this is from

1817
02:42:02.48 --> 02:42:06.16
the book the keel laying is the first of three ceremonies in the life of a ship symbolizing

1818
02:42:06.16 --> 02:42:10.72
the ship's transition from a mere concept to a product that will one day become a us warship

1819
02:42:10.72 --> 02:42:17.60
navy tradition is celebrated special keel laying ceremony for hundreds of years and so it talks

1820
02:42:17.60 --> 02:42:23.92
about the fact that you guys went to bath iron works up in main and and welded your initials onto

1821
02:42:23.92 --> 02:42:29.68
this like piece that goes in there that's sort of the that's sort of the initial there's just so

1822
02:42:29.68 --> 02:42:35.84
much tradition yeah that the navy has and it was yeah we would do those things and i and then

1823
02:42:35.84 --> 02:42:44.56
sal welded something in uh on the bridge someplace you know and it's like yeah and they somehow got

1824
02:42:44.56 --> 02:42:50.80
wood this guy captain smith is a great guy captain scott smith who like took this with the utmost

1825
02:42:50.80 --> 02:42:55.60
seriousness of course because he's the first commanding officer of this ship and he got they

1826
02:42:55.60 --> 02:43:03.20
got wood from the uss constitution like crazy how do you do that uh you have this here each

1827
02:43:03.20 --> 02:43:07.44
naval warship has its own crest and motto and captain smith who's the first commanding officer

1828
02:43:07.44 --> 02:43:12.24
took meticulous efforts to honor the ship's namesake with each one for the crest he was given

1829
02:43:12.24 --> 02:43:18.16
parameters of simply using a shield the rest was up to him he knew exactly what to do in order to

1830
02:43:18.16 --> 02:43:24.24
make sure the ship honored its names it's the ship and namesake perfectly there were a handful of

1831
02:43:24.24 --> 02:43:28.24
people family teammates and friends he would need to talk to was introduced to steve gilmore

1832
02:43:28.96 --> 02:43:37.92
retired surface naval surface warfare he's the best uh he he is he's just on your side oh he's

1833
02:43:37.92 --> 02:43:43.44
he's he's a hundred percent uh he helped me uh i'm very good friends with him and he helped me

1834
02:43:43.44 --> 02:43:47.68
with everything i ever need to help with and look i caused all kinds of trouble for that poor guy i

1835
02:43:47.68 --> 02:43:52.40
was constantly constantly caused that he would bail me out of all kinds of things so thank you

1836
02:43:52.40 --> 02:43:59.60
mr steve gilmore uh but he was able to connect captain smith with a bunch of different people

1837
02:43:59.60 --> 02:44:03.76
captain smith sat down for hours with each group learned as much as he could in order to create

1838
02:44:03.76 --> 02:44:08.72
something remarkable that would inspire his future crew members they would collectively come up with

1839
02:44:08.72 --> 02:44:14.96
the the connected with it with uh uh something that connected the family with the navy as well as

1840
02:44:14.96 --> 02:44:20.32
the ship's unique components and so this is for the motto of the ship became i will defend which

1841
02:44:20.32 --> 02:44:25.68
carries a three-fold meaning every military member takes an oath to support and defend the constitution

1842
02:44:25.68 --> 02:44:32.40
another prominent middle military ethos says i will defend the defenseless and the saint michael prayer

1843
02:44:32.40 --> 02:44:40.24
calls upon the mighty angelic soldier to defend us in battle have you been in have you been in the

1844
02:44:40.24 --> 02:44:51.68
ship i have when i talked to scott i was like uh we wanted something for the seals not to be forgotten

1845
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:58.000
and uh that's why if you walk in you'll see the pictures of those other seals and uh it was important

1846
02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:05.28
to us that those seals aren't forgotten because sometimes congressional medal of honor people

1847
02:45:05.28 --> 02:45:11.76
forget about these people well pain is the same and we wanted to remember them on that ship so

1848
02:45:12.80 --> 02:45:18.80
he did a good job for us no they did a beautiful job the ship was the ship was awesome and they

1849
02:45:18.80 --> 02:45:23.68
ended up with the the there's a flintlock pistol which came from the trident other thing which is

1850
02:45:23.68 --> 02:45:28.96
awesome there's a there's a roman numeral three which is like legit for team three scott did his

1851
02:45:28.96 --> 02:45:35.76
homework yeah i know he definitely um definitely did an awesome job with all that and eventually uh

1852
02:45:37.44 --> 02:45:51.36
the ship gets christened and and that was just awesome um christening took place that was up in

1853
02:45:51.36 --> 02:46:02.40
bath as well up in main that was when uh sally broke the that was fun for her she was so for

1854
02:46:02.40 --> 02:46:07.68
i just want to make sure i hit it hard enough i go well put my face right there

1855
02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.64
i'm sure you'll be able to pet muster it and that thing

1856
02:46:14.40 --> 02:46:20.16
uh and then finally you get the actual ships commissioning yeah and this is when the ship

1857
02:46:20.16 --> 02:46:26.000
becomes a us navy ship but it says here major hallowday was announced and approached the podium

1858
02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:31.44
to give the invocation he had flown in all the way from korea for the special event upon finishing

1859
02:46:31.44 --> 02:46:35.84
his opening prayer the other speakers approached the podium one after the other they rendered their

1860
02:46:35.84 --> 02:46:40.72
special remarks and honored the family of the ship's namesake as well as the impressive ship

1861
02:46:40.72 --> 02:46:47.60
itself then major general ron clark who was formerly a lieutenant colonel who is now a major

1862
02:46:47.60 --> 02:46:52.88
general this is how long it's been he's definitely a general who led the first of 506 red cur he battalion

1863
02:46:52.88 --> 02:47:01.20
during the battle of vermonti walked commandingly over to the podium we few we happy few we band of

1864
02:47:01.20 --> 02:47:10.32
brothers for he today that shares that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother the bravery and

1865
02:47:10.32 --> 02:47:15.04
sacrifice of these warriors is the highest form of service to our nation at a time when less than

1866
02:47:15.04 --> 02:47:20.24
one percent of american citizens will ever don the cloth of our nation in her defense these men

1867
02:47:20.24 --> 02:47:25.84
and women endured hardship danger and personal sacrifice every day to protect our country and

1868
02:47:25.84 --> 02:47:32.48
our way of life let me be very clear our band of brothers was brought together through our fight

1869
02:47:32.48 --> 02:47:40.88
against a tough and violent enemy in fact we refer to seal team three as army seals it was the fight

1870
02:47:40.88 --> 02:47:49.20
that brought us together but really what defined our task force was one word love a brotherly love

1871
02:47:49.20 --> 02:47:55.12
that warriors in arms share in battle defined by selfless commitment to a mission and selfless

1872
02:47:55.12 --> 02:48:03.12
commitment unfailing to one another there is no greater human emotion than the feeling to belong

1873
02:48:03.12 --> 02:48:11.44
to a team to a unit to a brotherhood to a family my association with these warriors has been the

1874
02:48:11.44 --> 02:48:23.36
most meaningful professional relationships of my life then you can anybody who served understands

1875
02:48:23.36 --> 02:48:30.32
that I mean there are guys that I met in the service that I love them as much as my own brothers

1876
02:48:30.32 --> 02:48:40.000
and the kind of situation in Ramadi that's even deeper yeah debbie lee will will explain that

1877
02:48:40.56 --> 02:48:46.72
you know mark would tell her these guys are my brothers and she'd say what what do you mean like

1878
02:48:46.72 --> 02:48:52.96
you have brother you know it's not the same and and then when mark died and she met all of us she

1879
02:48:52.96 --> 02:49:04.48
realized oh you are brothers yeah put the seal squeeze on her too finally the ship sponsor and

1880
02:49:04.48 --> 02:49:12.16
soul woman on stage walk to the podium she smiled or humbled demeanor evident all in attendance she

1881
02:49:12.16 --> 02:49:18.40
began by sharing her heartfelt gratitude to all who were with them to honor her son she continued

1882
02:49:18.40 --> 02:49:23.68
thanking the men and women of the military whom she regarded as the best in the world finally without

1883
02:49:23.68 --> 02:49:29.92
further ado she gave an order that the crew had been eagerly awaiting to hear officers and crew

1899
02:51:09.52 --> 02:51:19.36
for all i've met so many really wonderful people uh over this and uh father halloweday was uh was

1900
02:51:19.36 --> 02:51:27.92
won uh he also did a mass and baptized uh joseph son on that ship yeah so there's just a lot of

1901
02:51:27.92 --> 02:51:37.52
really really great people and um as far as that sal and i were just some good times well

1902
02:51:37.52 --> 02:51:44.88
now is that is that joseph son mickey yeah well mickey's yeah it is the weirdest thing right so

1903
02:51:44.88 --> 02:51:49.12
as you know i i wrote this book mickey and the dragons right and it's obviously it's the mickey's

1904
02:51:49.12 --> 02:51:56.56
named after mickey and my friend john bozak's the artist and uh i'm like hey you know here's the story

1905
02:51:56.56 --> 02:52:02.000
and so he sends me the first pictures and they're black and white so i don't really think much of it

1906
02:52:03.20 --> 02:52:09.52
and then first color one comes and in the book he's got mickey with blonde hair and i'm like hey man

1907
02:52:09.52 --> 02:52:16.56
you know like mickey's freaking lebanese bro he's black hair and but then when you look at the book

1908
02:52:16.56 --> 02:52:19.92
and he's like talking me through it you look at the book like even the cover like the it's all black

1909
02:52:19.92 --> 02:52:24.48
and he got this blonde head kid makes the kid stand out i'm like yeah all right well hey we're gonna

1910
02:52:24.48 --> 02:52:30.72
bleach out mickey a little bit but then i meet little mickey yeah and sure enough he's a toe head

1911
02:52:31.92 --> 02:52:40.000
yeah i think i told you i was complaining to joe i says joe you got three little girls and you got

1912
02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:45.92
mickey and they're all toe heads i says you couldn't have given me one brown kid with a big nose

1913
02:52:45.92 --> 02:52:58.64
seriously oh man um but i mean it is awesome seeing that ship and and with this book that you just

1914
02:52:58.64 --> 02:53:03.20
wrote with rosen rose did a fantastic job you know she's married to a seal so she captured a lot of

1915
02:53:03.20 --> 02:53:09.84
stuff she put up with a lot of stuff yeah i'm sure it was a challenge just trying to get stories out

1916
02:53:09.84 --> 02:53:15.12
of guys everyone's on all different schedules no she did a great job and and because she's married

1917
02:53:15.12 --> 02:53:21.04
to a seal i think she captured it in a way that um a normal author wouldn't have been able to yeah

1918
02:53:21.04 --> 02:53:28.40
when we talked um i'm she pestered me for two years and steve are going i don't know i think

1919
02:53:28.40 --> 02:53:40.96
she's pretty good anyway uh we talked it was like um i said we don't we want real stories because

1920
02:53:40.96 --> 02:53:48.24
she gave a synion samples of of uh other of authors and they wrote about the glory of war and all

1921
02:53:48.24 --> 02:53:54.64
that and i said i want to vomit i said that is not what we're looking for we want real stuff

1922
02:53:55.44 --> 02:54:01.52
and so uh what was good about the seals is she couldn't call them they wouldn't give her the

1923
02:54:01.52 --> 02:54:07.36
time of day i would call them and tell them what i'd like to do and we had a lot of stories but a

1924
02:54:07.36 --> 02:54:12.96
lot of the guys they didn't want to share those stories it was personal and so i respect that

1925
02:54:12.96 --> 02:54:22.72
but some of the guys uh after a couple of calls uh they would open up uh to uh to rose and uh i felt

1926
02:54:22.72 --> 02:54:29.68
like as they opened up they actually felt good about it and it kind of like let some let out a

1927
02:54:29.68 --> 02:54:35.44
little bit of uh some of that pressure what happened over there and i was surprised how many said it

1928
02:54:35.44 --> 02:54:41.52
was okay if they used uh you know their name so that's when i started thinking well then they probably

1929
02:54:41.52 --> 02:54:49.12
feel pretty good about it and it's these are all true stories so uh i i think it's uh it's a book

1930
02:54:49.12 --> 02:54:57.36
that uh is worth reading no it's uh it's a hundred percent worth reading and that's a way for mickey's

1931
02:54:57.36 --> 02:55:02.96
legacy to you know to carry on you carry on the ship and it's great when you meet the ship and the

1932
02:55:02.96 --> 02:55:08.72
ship's crew they're they all know the story they're all fired up i mean they do an awesome thing and

1933
02:55:08.72 --> 02:55:12.96
and it's written about in the book as well as you know when you pull into san diego harbour

1934
02:55:14.40 --> 02:55:19.20
off to your left hand side is rosecrance where mickey's buried and you know actually marx buried

1935
02:55:19.20 --> 02:55:25.44
there and sestones buried there but when you pull in they they man the rails and they give the the

1936
02:55:25.44 --> 02:55:31.12
ship salute you know to mickey which is just awesome so you get the legacy carrying on with the crew

1937
02:55:31.12 --> 02:55:39.52
with the ship in this book um and in the the young you know the young seals today they're this is what

1938
02:55:39.52 --> 02:55:43.92

1939
02:55:43.92 --> 02:55:47.36

1940
02:55:48.40 --> 02:55:55.04
that's mickey well you have those i think you have marx in there and and and mickey's is uh when

1941
02:55:55.04 --> 02:56:01.28
the seals come in there they see those displays yeah and i i actually think it's important so people

1942
02:56:01.28 --> 02:56:08.48
don't forget um no matter who it is there are guys that really uh they believed in what they did and

1943
