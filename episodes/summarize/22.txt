It's kind of like, you know, you got to consider the opportunity cost where some people, you got it, you know, you got to consider their credibility and then you got to kind of just go with it. So what that can end up with is this weird stiffness, you know, so you're going to end like it's like you've got to it's almost like you've got a warm up in life. And some people say, you know, well, I want to do, you know, I think they're, I think they're going to come out with this giant dream. And when you, I do know a little about a little bit about this where, um, so if you gain some a bunch of muscle, fast like a short period of period of time, you can have a way harder time dealing with, you know, the drawbacks of that muscle. The central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the central military commission of the party, the National Defense Commission, the Central People's Committee, and the administration council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, report to the entire people of the country with deepest grief that the great leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed away from a sudden attack of Il-nus at 2am. And if you're doing it, like I said, the right things for the right reasons, people are going to see you and they're going to follow. If you cultivate this, you know, muscular body build, whatever, um, over time, like let's say you started lifting at 15 years old and you're, you know, 35 years old now. I mean, that's not a crazy place to drive really, you know, come here to like, I don't know, I would buy whatever, yeah, or so to LA, man, hit the 405 North on a Thursday afternoon. I want to know, I want to see how people are going to handle other personalities. and you're learning some new technique, you know, I find if I cannot roll, when I'm in class, I'll like pay a little bit more attention to what the instruction is being given because I know I can't roll. You know, you know, now you meet some people sometimes and they tell me their dream, and I go, man, you ain't got a chance of that. but then I kind of got to like do twists, you know, and then I'm strong, you know, then I'm ready to do it. I mean, I do to an extent, but I want to know how it interoperates with the world, with the people and with the situations that you're going to face. That's the point that I think I'm trying to make is don't be comfortable because what you think is awesome right now, there could be so much more, you know, if you can envision and pay attention to what's going on in the rest of the world and break out of that paradigm that you're in and see that you can fly, you can fly around the world, you can do it. I've talked to five people in the last six months that I thought we're going to tell me about their dream and that I was going to be like in shock. Or other people who only lived in bad places, just like people who grew up in a real negative household, when they go out into the world, just their beginning view of the world is negative. And I'll tell you, I've, I've thought about this and I've been waiting for people to start saying like, oh, you put another picture of the sweat and of a squat rack really, but I don't know if they understand. And you know, another thing I've been saying lately, when I'm out working with people is I used to not really understand why people are drawn to this complexity Like, hey, wait, that's, you know, that's a cool way of doing it or you know, whatever the group is. What did the leaders know about the people who started black markets and started growing these gardens and selling what they could to get people started to try and survive through exercising their personal freedoms.
