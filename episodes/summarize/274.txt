but if everything you is kind of blocking white you're sort of you're sort of like hey this is what everyone this is what you're going to do and you have no you paint yourself in that corner and you have no way out of it hmm going back to the book I should never have had any problems in Vietnam because it was an infantry war infantry and helicopters with a different quality of commanders the helicopters could have played a very important role in command and control the unfortunate fact was that the commanders kept their butts glued in the seats in the birds I don't think I can overemphasize the weaknesses and heritness from 1,500 feet up war was simply a lot of little guys in green running here and there shooting up the landscape the birdmen he's talking about the commander's fast forward a little bit the birdmen may have been commanders in the technical sense of the word but they weren't leaders and the grunts knew it down there was their world it was a ground war an infantry exercise and as infantry we could have won it man for man we were better and we could have won it with less than half the people we had there all we had to do was get rid of the wasted headquarters chaff get rid of the px's in the state houses and the clubs and the massage parlors and the pools and the pizza houses and the commissaries and get down to fighting an infantry war we had the training and we had the men who could have done the job the problem was not only a lack of command leadership but a lack of distinct mission we didn't have one before I got there we didn't have one while I was there and we never had one after I left but an army requires a mission it desperately needs some direction towards a specific goal it was all charts and graphs for us with machine technicians like the West Point engineers running the show I don't think we have to be conditioned to kill we need no training to destroy will built for that killing comes easy established no rules and leave a vacuum and won what you end up with our me lie and cool away the absence of policy and mission was a policy in itself need to know what the freaking mission is by the way in war freaking absolutely I guess we'll in your normal life fully we have to leaders have to lead their troops to make sure that they are not just doing the right thing that they're not just passing the CNN test but they're also doing what's legal otherwise there's going to be repercussions that's just that's just the way it is the seriality all right back to the book when I remember the folly of it all now I rationalize a bit and tell myself that there wasn't enough time to be fully sensitive to the finality of death for instance to say that it had not been a very important day because the second battalion had but two NVA kills now seems ludicrous it was a damn important day for those two dead men when even just one man died or got his fingers blown off for his legs shattered or is hearing impaired or his eyes bludded and blinded it was one hell of a costly battle especially if you happen to be the guy who got it that day it's something generals and presidents can never understand only mothers fathers brothers sons daughters and wives maybe if I were a general or a president who never went to war with his men or who never risked paying the same price maybe I'd want to convert the whole damn show into a statistical table to be read solemnly by some broadcaster every Thursday night generals and presidents are fine for explaining to all of us those things that we ought to be willing to die for but when the war is over all that's left our statistics and the generals and the presidents are always among the living if anything has happened to our country as a result of the Vietnam war it is that our national infection with the sickness of the numbers game we reduced the blood and the suffering and the death and destruction to mere ciphers and in doing so we reduced our own souls numbers don't die people do columns of figures don't disintegrate in the explosion of a bomb human beings do statistics don't bleed and if you make your war a war of numbers you will have no trouble sleeping most generals and presidents slept well so this stuff is continuing on in another mind boggling plot twist on April 2, 1969 Barnes gave me a letter of commendation from general counters who had replaced general peers as the commander of the first field force victor he also handed me a letter from peers which had come all the way from the states peers was quite complimentary and Barnes added that the second battalion was the best in the brigade and that I was the best battalion commander he had personally ever known and then he says he opened up he had been a platoon leader and his group had police up a detainee from a village that had reported the details to a CEO over the company net the platoon had began to tie up the the detainee for extraction when the co called back the lieutenant told me the co said what they had out there was a kia a dead dink a body count of one to which the lieutenant replied that he did not have a dead person but a detainee and reasonably good health so he says no what we have is a dead dink killed trying to get away the lieutenant continued so what did you say I asked well I told him the guy might be a civilian and what did he say he said that wasn't hardly possible because once he's dead he's a dink which in fact was about the only way it was played in Vietnam regardless of what a person might have been before he was killed afterwards he was a dink very very damn few people ever reported killing a civilian regardless of how unavoidable the death might have been and very damn few dead civilians failed to be included in body counts it was time to stop the lieutenant though before his narrative went beyond the point of no return I held up my hand hold you do you understand did that make sense because I know I jumped in the story so basically this young lieutenant is there they have a detainee that they've captured and he calls his company commander and says hey company commander I got a I got a captured individual I got a detainee you know what do you want me to do and the the commanding officer calls back and says you don't have a detainee you have a killed an action and you know that the the term dink obviously this is a slur and and with that kind of you kind of think like how did how did let's say that the guys like all wrong like because let's face according to the story kind of sounds like they're almost like corrupt almost where they're like hey who cares you know kind of thing and that's what I'm thinking but the reality is like so these aren't like bad people like most people aren't just bad people who are just like destined for corruption or whatever it's almost like you kind of got to consider how did they get there why is it like that it's not because they're just these evil people who finally got there position of power and now can just exploit weakness and nothing like that this one's not bad not about area we've got really good intel looks good all right go look go ahead and execute this one all right if you're gonna do a hundred missions you're going okay look this one's a little bit more high risk but we're gonna go it seems like a well-making impact will go executed there's a tendency well not a tendency there's a possibility that you say you know what look I don't want to have everyone get hurt I don't want to have any bad you know I don't have any negatives on my evaluation I just want to get my job done to move on you know I want to punch the ticket so you end up doing 14 missions and you did your job good for you and now you get your ticket punched and you go home and everyone's good and by the way when you get home because it was get rid of everyone says yes and you know the freaking mission is fast forward as we continue to score every night Franklin began to increase his visits to the field finally he made it a point to be on hand personally to personally count the bodies and I found myself as his constant escort guiding him from one dead man to the next and standing by while he snapped photos it was another syndrome the guys that didn't kill anybody were the ones who broke their asses to get a picture what the hell it would probably have been the same way with Indian scalps if we had cameras back then so Franklin is out there kind of coming out and he goes through a bunch of this stuff there's a guy named Grimshaw and we're gonna hear his name later one of his company commanders Grimshaw said a dead VC is a dead VC and a dead NVA is a dead NVA and a dead VCI is a dead VCI except of course when killed by the second battalion then there are only dead if Franklin touches the touches his toe to them and they better be wearing a uniform and have a weapon what the hell is I trying to do Franklin asked I had to be an ass to move to rifle companies that distance in the dark why they might have opened up on each other if either of them had become disoriented and besides he said it was one big waste we could have taken them all in a court and search and saved all the inconvenience so meanwhile while all this stuff is happening the the brigade is keeping battalion scores they're keeping scores to figure out who's the best battalion who's the best battalion they keep track of a bunch of different things enemy killed an a killed an action body count enemy prisoners of war enemy contacts enemy weapons captured number of a wall he he he mentioned that they had uh the first black replacement showing up and he was like we didn't you know we don't the what the troops didn't care if you did a good job you were we're good he talked about the fact that he was raised by that doctor that was like hey all these people in the world they're people like you they're out there aren't trying to feed their families so he's seems like he's this kind of straight laced for lack of a better word good person man I like to sit down with this dude he's not alive but he uh so he calls the coach like you know you know when you're in college let's face it like you get into some sort of thing you say hey coach I'm in this thing like what can we do to sort of you know I hope to work it out so he calls the coach and he's like hey this is what happened I mean jail but if you don't do a good job when this when this platoon gets back from this mission you're going out with the next platoon until you do a freaking good job he performed poorly in the field just as he vowed he would and I had him held at the gate when his unit came back I had asked children which is his senior on to go to get the very best trooper he could find to guard white until the replacement unit he was going to join came out someone who wouldn't scare and he came up with pfc shnelling don't take any crap from him I told shnelling and watch out the unit coming out will pick him up that was it except that shnelling drilled him through the head and killed him right outside the gate white had some words and shnelling had paid no attention white had made a threat and then gone for his rifle he got it to his shoulder before shnelling squeezed the trigger and the MP at the gate had seen and heard it all thank God it was that cut and dry shnelling had done his job I brought in the criminal investigation division people they questioned everyone took statements and that was it except that later in the day I had shnelling into the office a crowd of white's friends gathered outside chanting we want shnelling we want shnelling he killed a brother he killed a brother we want shnelling we want shnelling freaking nasty yeah there's some great leadership lessons in the both these books that's for sure like some read like that thing about planning if you let your team come up with a plan they're invested they have a material interest in seeing the plants succeed that right there's gold read those books look you come away feeling empty like I did let me fill in that whole little bit there I just did I just filled in my own hole in my heart for getting to the end of this book by saying hey if you let your team come up with a plan if they have a material interest in making the plan succeed there you go I feel better already me too and so did herber makes sense so almost like they should maybe think about and I'm saying this with complete ignorance by the way but they should change the little system to be you know like diving you're much diving like I don't know Olympics or whatever diving right like platform whatever they have they have a discord and the difficulty level so we'll print 50 mm if you don't pre-order don't be mad pre-order so you can get that first that dish leadership strategy intact is field manual the code the evaluation is a protocol this means freedom fan

out there in the service of our nation around the world just trying to remember that the enemies outside the wire and trying to keep the eagles in check and support each other and to our police and law enforcement firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correction officers in board patrol and secret service and all first responders out there every single day thank you for doing what you do so that we can do what we do and to everyone else listen antagonistic relationships do not help you in life they don't help your mission they don't help your team if you don't agree with somebody on something find something that you do agree on build bonds instead of breaking them there is enough in the world trying to rip a support fight that it's how we all win in the end and until next time zekko and jockel out but that's not gonna work but these guys like they want to they want to kill me already you know I already killed they're got like we're at war right now with this war within the war going on right now here's what here's the only thing that makes me think well how it turned out you think but god I don't even know what to say about this like it's just a freaking nightmare this whole book is freaking crazy like when you think let look at what we just read you got this freaking soldier killing another soldier you got the woman getting her throat slash there's four other people executed it's madness all right under what circumstances do you slay the girls through because obviously the girls not military nothing like this so it's like all right we got to see vengeance this is obviously out of line obviously not part of this you know we're all the same team where you're going to kill this guy all you know no matter what happens kind of like you didn't have to kill him it's easy to be like you didn't have to kill him no one really seems to notice that oh we're getting smoke and pot like it's just bad across the board and a lot of it has to do with what is our mission what is our mission why what what what what means we want what means we want if you don't even know what means you want how are you gonna you know if you went on a football field and you didn't know what how if you didn't know how to score a goal what would you do what would you do you wouldn't be able to do anything you wouldn't but as long as you know hey here's where you're trying to get to so the idea that he was bound to win no actually doesn't work out that way Colonel Herbert fights it he fights this spends a bunch of his own money and then he goes on the offense because he won in investigations before now he goes on the offense charges uh brings charges up against Colonel Franklin 14 separate specifications including failure to report murders and church torture he does the same thing to general barns fail up failure to report war crimes on multiplications so he's going on the offense it gets national publicity it's in the news the lead investigator for the army this guy by the name of major Carl Hensley according to the book and I hate to say that I'm just because I don't know what I don't know what the truth is according to the book this guy major Carl Hensley had told Herbert like look we believe you you're right we can win this thing but he is the illustrator for the way the way kid series and my kids dragons and Mike in the dragons and some postages as well anyway this is good artists we enlisted him for some of the designs on this subscription shirt situation called the shirt locker check you know when looking to that if you like that amen get that jocca store dot com is where that's it we got you can you can subscribe to this podcast or the other podcast we got a jocca on rambling got a few new episodes of that out their savage grounded podcast which we haven't done in a while but where your kid podcast we got some new those new of those out if you want to you can check all those out you can subscribe you can also join us on the underground the ug jocca ug jocca on the ground dot com little alternative podcast we've been doing some q and a on there from people that are on jocca on the ground if you want to subscribe to that go to jocca on the ground dot com it costs eight dollars and eighteen cents a month if you can't afford that it's hey we're going to get a new Italian commander soon enough don't worry about this guy we got he's going to be going to do here for six months what what are we trying to do make money right we can run these little scams and make some money we we just want to have the time pass so I can move on I can just be done with my job trust me that's that's a real thing even in today's military like have you ever heard does zero defect zero defect model where it's like and then he kills himself kills himself with a shotgun you can you can look that one up it's in a New York Times press briefing major Carl Hensley suicide ends up all the charges are eventually dropped against both barns and Franklin Colonel Franklin eventually relieved from his command for throwing a Vietnamese body out of a helicopter in Vietnam and again this guy was the most decorated from what I could find in research most decorated officer from his West Point class 1950 1991 by the way Colonel Franklin convicted and spent five years in prison for us securities scheme scam swindled about $100 people out a million dollars so there's like you know you see these questionable characters characteristics so all the charges so imagine us all the charges against barns and Franklin get dropped but Herbert is not charged with making a single fall statement so all these things that he had said he never gets charged for making a fall statement but the charges get dropped he goes kind of public does a bunch of interviews eventually he's retired or he retires you know he's done with the army he gets eventually he gets interviewed on 60 minutes by Mike Wallace and this is freaking crazy so so they start going through and this is what's really interesting about this book is they have like the the actual documents from this guy Warden I started in first class Warden during the period of 14 February that's Valentine's Day 1969 was a platoon sergeant for so he explains what he saw happen and you can get this book and read those documents then this happens a day or two after the St. Valentine's Day massacre which we just read about a black trooper named white refused to go into the field and offered his refusal loud and clear out in the battalion street where he could be heard by one and all you're going out white just like everybody else I told him like hell and I just hits me as something more like, hey, we're almost like a compliance officer like kind of like, hey, just to make sure everyone's kind of doing the right thing. no no one tells you so what are you gonna do so as a leader you gotta take that into account you gotta make sure people know what the mission is you gotta know what the strategy is when you better know why you're going to war and you better make that perfectly clear when you're going check empty feeling sorry don't like it all and they were like it was weird because yeah my friend the name's Dave he's the one who got it stolen from he was like looking around for he's like you know you're just confused it's not like something kind of steal your whole video right he's like a straight-laced guy that's when he sees stuff like that it he's unacceptable to and and that's what's about the about the guy white getting killed he's not the Herbert's not the kind when I'm Herbert you remember in Korean War they go hey burned down this village he's like I'm not gonna do it I prefer not to answer that one right now if it's okay with you that's your prerogative you keep this to yourself until I get back to you do you want to put it in writing I think that I think I'd better do that good he said I said handing him a pad bring it back when you finished and forget about going out and see company right now it can wait so obviously bad situation he starts to run it up the chain a command who's that include Franklin what does Franklin say what the hell kind of commander are you he asked it's none of your business what occurred before you assumed command I'll back it up with an investigation I said there'll be no investigation says Franklin it's required sir damn it Tony said the investigations are ongoing what more can I do the next morning when I reported Barnes was behind his desk and Franklin was in the chair to his right it was quick Colonel Herbert the general said I'm going to replace you as the commander of second battalion I felt the blood drained from my head replace sir you mean relief not relief Tony replace I'm giving you a maximum efficiency report and sending you to Saigon hit me like a ton of rocks it is is it over the allegations I made sir Franklin leap to his feet screaming that's right you son of a bitch you and your goddamn lies about beach and crouched and all the rest that poor lieutenant and every other one of your damn lies and exaggerations so clearly they were buttering him up I have not seen it dang all watchbook two new watch cobra no not deal so there's a fight there's a fight in the beginning where this psycho guy takes over the supermarket or whatever right and cobra is kind of one of these guys he uses excessive force you know kind of like demolition men same actor by the way so that's just so either way so cobra ends up killing this guy right Let's straight shooter that kind of a little bit of black and white, little bit of like, hey, right and wrong, good or bad, good or evil, he seems like he's got that kind of a personality. damn loser dink he rolled it over gently the guy had been a real trooper and he had tried to do just as he had been told just as so many of our kids had been told and would have tried had they been in his place uncle hoe would never even know the poor bastard was dead nor would he have given a shit if he had known like those on our side he was just another statistic we left him there in the dirt we started back down the trail at a truck and outright run was out of the question because more than likely if you broke out of the bush running you were a dead ass even at our speed it was more than a few seconds before we reach a large grassy clearing the american lieutenant the advisor was on my left as we entered the clearing and the rest of were standing around in no particular formation across the clearing I saw one man a Vietnamese holding the young girl's hair with his left hand bending her head back bearing her throat his right arm was around her neck and a knife in his right hand was dug deeply into her flesh beneath and to the left of her softfrogus all he had to do was pull I mean one of your soldiers kills one of your other soldiers after you say hey you you got to go out it's like nuts and then you're thinking well look then you're thinking is it worth it like hey this guy white I could have just said all right fine you're not going out okay in this scenario it makes no sense whatsoever in this scenario Herbert saying look that's a freaking war crime that's what he's saying that's what we're two like Herbert he's you know like on the like he's uh what I say earlier he's a straight-laced guy and then yeah there's the criminal thing to do so when you're doing something hey listen I can explain this you know the the CNN test have you ever heard of this before look if I can go on CNN and say hey this is why I made this decision and you don't feel shame because of what you did that's definitely part of the test the other thing you got to remember is what is legal because if you let and this is something you can tell you your your employees or your troops you got to remember about what's legal because someone that should steer because look if if you're let's say you're in a you're in a platoon you're out on a target and you find somebody that's killed Americans right they freaking kill they have the bodies and you catch them with the bodies and with the freaking bloody knife there's almost no one that would say right you know everything got a fit uh got a fit in the door so he pulled out the drawer of the bed and like took you know you can take out the drawer so he unhooked it and like took it out and blown there it was Davey did that Davey did that too so if you don't basically if you don't take that much action you don't want make that mean mistakes right on you can have the zero defect record you have the zero defect record I went on deployment I did four missions they all went well get a bronze star go home get a good evaluation and we're good to go or I'm gonna go over there I'm gonna do a hundred missions every single one of those missions is a freaking challenge and by the way if you're doing four missions you can kind of hand pick like if you do 10 missions you do 20 missions you're hand pick look we're on the path we're learning stuff lessons hard any easy by the way obviously well you know how they say like there's hard lessons like the hard lessons are the ones that are learned like the best yes true he who suffers remembers it's 34 27 37 60 and second battalion has 66 for enemy weapons captured it's 15 11 3 and 17 16 second battalion has 57 so this is not even it's almost like it's not even close for absent ways that without leave so this is this should you want below number here it's 14 24 26 and 24 and what is second battalion have eight they only have eight people that have gone a wall for article 15s the numbers are 39 56 57 and 52 what is second battalion have 24 for delinquency reports 17 9 11 10 second battalion has five malaria they're all the same reenlistments listen to this reenlistments the numbers are zero zero 40 and zero no one wants to frequency in what is second battalion have 53 so the total score and I understood what made a grunt tick because I knew what made me tick I'd also been fortunate enough to gather enough psychological insight to comprehend them and myself even more deeply and thoroughly at the same time gaining enough military experience to recognize that they were the best raw material in the world they were bigger and healthier and more intelligent and better educated than any soldier the US army had ever had the opportunity to use before and they were superior to any soldier any other country was getting even with our training shortcomings and there were by god plentiful the grunts and Vietnam were still the best trained men around as well as the best fed and best equipped more over I think I recognize something that must have slipped by most of the brass including Westmoreland and later Abrams that the length of the hair on a man's head wasn't nearly as important as the caliber of the brain inside I knew that the grunt was a man just like me and that he was entitled to the same respect I myself demanded his dignity was sacred it could never be changed the commander could scream and rant and rage and curse like a sailor but he could never encroach on the troopers dignity. well I I wonder if his friends were kind of like look we know why and why it was kind of like he maybe he you know maybe they knew what type of person he was but you take and you put all these factors in place like the fact that hey if you go do this tour you're going to get promoted you're going to get more money you're you got to go do this and when you get over there well what's the best way to get a good evaluation you get a good evaluation by doing whatever else is doing late you know you don't want to stick your head up and be the one that gets draws a bunch of attention and then you have all these rules sometimes those rules do get kind of looked over some on a smaller level right and sometimes it can be more efficient meanwhile you got this guy who's kind of by the book and most people are most people I'm pretty I almost want to say everybody's not going to be by the book hundred percent of the time okay in one way or another and as he's starting to dig into the he's going on some ops he's starting to dig into trying to find out how to get the he get the platoon's moving in the right direction um he's got he sits down to talk to one of one of these latinits he's talking to the sleutannet and the lieutenant kind of he this lieutenant doesn't want to go in the field doesn't want to go in the field and he's trying to figure out why and the lieutenant says you know not with this particular leader and he says I laid out the strategy for my battalion it was some lousy war when a piddling battalion commander had to lay out a master strategy but that's the way it was hell nobody else laid out anything for these men either from a national or an international perspective I ordered to them to give them some kind of purpose and a reason at the battalion level at least got to know why you're doing and what you're doing and he's saying they're not even hearing that fast forward a little bit in fact the whole damn US army in Vietnam was crazy the generals west moreland Abrams pierced Ross and depue Richardson you will ramsey and the rest were all working on the premise that they were the best in that whatever problems we were having were the fault of the commanders at lower levels. I said quietly and calmly you're finished here the rest of this like the charges will take care back at base so he witnesses this this this this atrocity and gets back to base runs it up the chain of command tells to frankly Franklin frankly Franklin he tells Franklin what happens Franklin finally asked what had happened and I told him every last sword detail right down to the blood leaping from the girls throat Herbert you're a goddamn liar he said I sure to my wasn't lying there are other witnesses sir then you're exaggerating he said did the american did the lieutenant take part oh you didn't find them no we never found them but same thing like what's this guy gonna do he's gonna hide that knife and then take it home and put it under his pillow like he's not gonna be able to use it because we'll see him but man this guy was gone and that makes even less sense when you think about it because it's not like you're not gonna wear him when you're gonna do just steal him and put him in your house under your pillow or something like this you're gonna be wearing them around.
