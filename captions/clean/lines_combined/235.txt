00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 235 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000 Can we may Earl?
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000 Wanted my brothers.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000 Awesome guy, incredible seal.
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000 But at one point in time, I didn't know if you would keep his leg.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000 The army doctors seemed neutral in their assessment and my assessment was that they actually didn't know.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:00.000 And because they didn't know, my guess is they didn't want to get his hopes up, but at the same time, they didn't want to crush his morale either.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.000 And Cowey is the seal that I wrote about in the opening of the book that I caught in my leadership. This is the seal that told me he wanted to stay.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000 He begged me to let him stay there in Ramadi with us. He did not want to go home.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.000 He wanted to stay with his platoon. He wanted to stay with the task unit. He wanted to stay with the soldiers and marines that we were fighting alongside.
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000 But the fact of the matter was that he had to go.
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000 He had to go. He had to go to better medical facilities with more capabilities to see if he could keep his leg.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000 And we're kind of standing there talking to him kind of saying goodbye because we know he has to go the brigade commander walked in.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000 And we all quietly came to attention.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000 And I'd spent a little bit of time with the brigade commander at this point. I'd brief him on our capabilities.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:37.000 I'd been in some planning meetings, seen him out on the streets during a few operations. He was very well respected amongst his troops.
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000 The troops that we were working with army and marines and his brigade combat team.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:57.000 The second brigade combat team of the 28th Infantry Division. The iron soldiers they had been fighting in Ramadi for almost a year.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000 And we from Seal Team 3 task unit bruiser.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000 We had nothing but the highest respect and admiration for all of them. They were professional.
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000 They were aggressive. They were courageous and let there be no doubt.
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000 That the soldiers and the marines from the 228 saved the lives of some of the Seals and Task unit bruiser.
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:41.000 Because they told us where we should go and where we shouldn't go. They advised us on what to do and what not to do. They rolled out and guided us on operations.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000 They mentored and they coached us.
00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:01.000 They did an outstanding job taking the fight to the enemy. And at this point when Cali got wounded, we'd been on the ground less than a month.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:15.000 And this was the first significantly wounded seal in Task unit bruiser.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000 And this brigade commander Colonel John Gronsky was there to pay a purple heart on Cali's chest.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:38.000 And I watched the Colonel watch his attitude. Watch his behavior. He was solemn but at the same time he was uplifting.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000 And what I could tell is I could tell that he cared.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000 I could sense that. I think we all could sense that. And understand that at this point he had done this hundreds of times.
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000 In the last year awarded purple hearts to combat wounded soldiers.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:15.000 And each time I could tell that it mattered and each time I could tell that it left a mark.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:30.000 And I knew that the Colonel had also sent many men on their final flight home.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000 Their angel flights.
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000 Colonel Gronsky had lost scores of men at this point killed in action.
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000 And those obviously leave an even deeper mark.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:06.000 They leave a scar.
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000 And I watched his Colonel Gronsky spoke quietly to Cali.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000 I couldn't hear what he said, but Cali nodded and affirmed whatever had been said.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000 And the Colonel put the purple heart metal on Cali's chest.
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000 And the showcans again.
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000 And the Colonel left.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000 And Cali was soon on a helicopter heading out of her body.
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000 And he would not be our last casualty.
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000 But he was our first and he was my first significantly wounded man,
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000 while in a leadership position.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:18.000 And if you know anything about me, you know that I'm trying to learn constantly.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000 And I learned from the Colonel that day, the way he acted, the way he carried himself.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000 Maintaining that delicate balance.
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:47.000 Because I could tell that he was steadfast, that these tragedies would not discourage his determination.
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000 But I could also see that he cared, that he truly cared about Cali.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000 My brother, my seal, a man he'd never met before.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000 I could also see that this was part of our job as leaders.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000 We have to bear this burden. I would have to bear this burden.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000 And we would have to press on.
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.000 We would have to do our duty in the face of horrible wounds and tragic loss.
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:54.000 And I knew that Colonel Gronsky had been there for almost a year.
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000 And I knew that I was just getting started.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:10.000 And I knew I had to do my best to carry the torch forward,
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000 to bear that burden of command to do my duty.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000 And to follow that example.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:55.000 Well, to strange thing, because those memories of war, sometimes they feel like a long time ago, sometimes they feel like yesterday.
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000 But we don't forget them.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000 And I won't forget what I learned.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.000 And it's an honor today to have the opportunity to learn some more from that Colonel.
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:35.000 Although he is no longer a Colonel, he's no longer in the army. You retired as a two-star general, a major general who just wrote a book called The Ride of Our Lives.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000 And he is here with us today.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000 General Gronsky, thank you for coming on the program.
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000 Thank you.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000 Yeah, it was really weird to see I was sitting in my car as you pulled up into the parking lot today.
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000 And you know what, I mean, obviously I haven't seen you since the spring of 2006.
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000 And I remember meeting you for the first time.
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000 I don't know if you'll remember meeting me for the first time.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000 And I know that as the brigade commander, you're meeting people all the time, people are coming in and out.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000 When I met you for the first time, I went to your tactical operations center.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000 And right as I arrived, so we had been on the ground for just a matter of days. Do you remember this at all?
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000 Slightly, I'm going to be asked not in the detail you probably do.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000 I would be shocked if you remembered it.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:45.000 I walked in and as I walked into your tactical operations center, the report comes in that one of my seal snipers, there's actually a BTF Tony, had just killed an IED in place or up on firecracker.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000 And that kind of got announced in the tactical operations center.
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000 And you heard it.
00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000 And I knew who you were because I had gathered in tell on you and read your background and done research to figure out who you were and what you know.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000 And so I knew exactly who you were.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.000 And just that that announcement, following that announcement, you walked from the talk into your office and then people walked me into your office.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000 It was the best introduction to human being could ever want in a combat situation.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000 And you looked at me and and you said that's one of your guys that just killed us an IED in place or I said yes sir.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:37.000 And you immediately said I need your guys over an Eastern Romadi and I said, we will go wherever you want us to go wherever there's bad guys and that was how the deployment kicked off.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000 Eastern Romadi was a pretty pretty bad place.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000 Yeah, and it was I think it felt good. I mean, I could see the looks on the people in the in the tactical operation center.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:00.000 The looks on their faces that we just killed an IED in place or that was right where in firecracker a few days prior an IED and killed several Marines and so often.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000 The enemy just you know in Romadi would just disappear. They take their shots. They do their thing and then they disappear.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000 And that was really one of the most frustrating things. You didn't many times you just didn't have an enemy to fire back at.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.000 Yeah.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000 Before we get into all that.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000 Let's let's let's go back because you know we all everyone wants to know about you who you are.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000 And I want to start off actually by reading a little chunk of of your book to kind of give a little background to everybody.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000 And so the book is called the right of our lives. It just came out I think in February.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000 So I'm I'm going to read this chunk right here.
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000 My dad Paul Xavier Gronsky senior was raised by his mother a Polish immigrant.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000 My grandmother never learned to speak English well. She owned a small grocery store selling primarily candy and cigarettes.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000 My paternal grandfather of also a Polish immigrant died in an accident in the coal mines near Screm.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000 When my grandmother was five months pregnant with my dad.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000 The son of a single parent. My father was forced to quit school after the seventh grade.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000 So he could work and help support the family.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000 My dad served overseas during World War II in the US Army Air Corps.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000 Dad opened a garage in 1954 doing minor car repairs and selling use tires.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000 Soon he bought cars to fix up and sell and so began his venture into the used car business.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000 His family and his business were growing.
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:42.000 But dad and my entire family faced a devastating setback in 1956 with my mother passed away when I was very young.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000 That became a single parent with seven children to raise and a business to run.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000 It was a severe blow.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000 But dad fought through it.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000 By outward measures my father was unimpressive standing five feet six inches tall.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000 Dad weighed about 135 pounds.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000 But my dad was a grinder.
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000 And he had the blood of an entrepreneur.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000 Through sheer hard work and desire he raised his children while building an enterprise that included a garage.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000 Used car sales, a towing service, a boat sales and service business and a bike shop.
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000 Known as Paul Gronsky enterprises.
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000 Dad's business became a landmark in Northeastern Pennsylvania.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000 Paul X Gronsky senior a man with only a seventh grade education became a pillar of the community and a leader in his church.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000 So that's the environment you grew up in.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000 Yeah, do you remember your mom?
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000 She died three days after I was born.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000 And you were number seven, right?
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000 Right.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000 What's your dad doing in the Army Air Corps?
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000 Well, he had a very basic job. He was a cook.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000 He worked in restaurants in the 20s and 30s.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000 And he became a cook and I think his favorite war story was a time that he prepared a meal for Dwight Eisenhower in the mess hall.
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000 That's a pretty memorable story.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000 Right. And what was it growing up? I mean, obviously, you got no mom at home.
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000 I mean, look, I got four kids and I got my wife is a state home mom.
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.000 Right.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000 And I could barely control the chaos and may have been going on when they were little.
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000 That must have been complete insanity.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000 Yeah, you know, it allowed us kids to kind of grow up with a lot of self discipline.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000 I was lucky though. I had two older sisters. They became surrogate mothers to me.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000 My sister Ruthie, my sister Anne. And then I had an aunt, my father's sister was also a surrogate mother.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000 So although I lost one mother, I ended up having three.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000 And I did feel a lot of love in the family.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000 Was Ruthie that much or your two sisters? How much older were they?
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000 Yeah, they're both a little over ten years older than I am.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000 So, you know, they were, you know, 10, 11, 12 years old at the time.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000 Yeah. And that's like a 10 or 11 year olds when they have responsibility put on them.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000 They can pick it up and they can do a lot exactly.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000 And, you know, it's just like anything else. You're putting that situation and you just got a dig deep and you got a figure it out and you got a drive on.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000 And that's, and again, this was back in late 50s.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.000 And I guess it was a little bit more of a osteo life back then and people just were able to stand up this challenge as like that.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 How big was your house?
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000 The house I grew up in.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000 The best I could recall my mother passed away.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000 They were living in a single family dwelling.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000 And then again, I just know this is I was getting old enough to remember things.
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000 We were actually living in a house with my grandmother.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000 So my grandmother was in one room.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000 My anon Uncle bur up stairs.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000 They kind of had the second floor to house and then everybody else was spread out in bedrooms.
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000 I mean, I remember my brother Jimmy sleeping with my father in bed.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000 I mean, they just slept together.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.000 That's how it was.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000 I remember sleeping in bed with two other brothers.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000 I mean, that's just the way it was back then.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000 Yeah, if you couldn't come up with a good answer for how big your house was.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000 I was going to say, all right, how many kids slept in your bed with you?
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000 No, I wasn't alone.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000 You're not the seven family, seven kid family with no mom and not having to have a share some bed space.
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000 Exactly. That's that's the way it was.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000 And then not going to school and everything.
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000 I mean, what was what was what kind of school did you go to?
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000 Yeah, I went to a public school when I was in first grade and then I, I'm a Catholic.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000 So I was put into a Catholic school for second grade. So I could receive first holy communion.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000 But I would have to go through extra classes like I would have a five as a public school.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000 And then I went back to public school again and third grade and continued my education in public school.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000 Your dad's an efficiency expert.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000 I guess he is.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000 What, what, what, what were your interests in school?
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000 Well, as I, as I got older, my main interest was football.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000 I just really loved playing football. I loved everything about it.
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000 I wasn't that great of an athlete.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000 I ended up starting when I was a senior.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000 Finally, when I was a senior, I got, I got the, the start on the football team.
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000 And I was an offensive guard at 165 pounds.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000 How big, how big was your school? Was it a big school?
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000 Did you go to high school in Scranton?
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000 I was in outside of Scranton. It was a more emerged school district tailor and
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000 Moose of Pennsylvania merged together.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000 Name the school was Riverside. I think we graduated around 100 kids.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000 How big were the games? How many people showed up?
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000 I mean, the stadium was packed.
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000 And, you know, northeast of Pennsylvania football is king.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000 Even today, there's very little soccer and a lot of football.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000 Although soccer is getting bigger.
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000 And, you know, our school had, I think, three sports.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000 I mean, they had football, basketball, baseball.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000 And I think there was golf.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000 They didn't even have track and field when I went to school there.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000 In my senior year, we had intramural track and field,
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000 but, you know, never competing against other schools.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000 Now they finally do. But no swim team.
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000 There weren't that many opportunities for sports in the school that I graduated from at that time.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000 What, anything else you were interested in? And did you have to work?
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000 Oh, my God. I mean, you know, it was kind of like a family farm where, you know,
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000 I mean, all my brothers and sisters and I all worked in the garage.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000 And I remember even when I was a young kid in grade school,
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000 I would be in the garage sweep and floors.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000 I would be studying tires. You know, at that time you put stud and snow studs and snow tires.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 Then when I was 16, I began driving to tow truck.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 And that was pretty cool. You know, to go out tow cars,
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000 although in the winter, man, you know, winter in North Houston, Pennsylvania.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000 Every winter we would get about, you know, maybe three or four weeks,
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000 where it was like, you know, much below freezing.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000 So you had to be out there towing cars, jumping cars, you know,
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000 cables and all this, you know, changing flat tires and the freezing snow.
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000 It was pretty hard work.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000 But so I guess I got used to using my hands and doing hard work at an early age.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000 At what point did you start viewing the military as an option?
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000 Well, you know, my dad always, really, he was very proud of the fact that he had an opportunity to serve.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000 And he always encouraged me to serve.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000 And when I graduated from high school, I went to a college in the local area,
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000 university of Scranton, the head of an ROTC program there.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000 My dad wanted me to join to ROTC, but believe it or not,
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000 even though I read a lot of books about World War II,
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000 when I was very patriotic, I was brought up that way.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000 For some reason, I just didn't want to have anything to do with the ROTC.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000 And so the first two years go by, no ROTC,
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000 even though my dad was encouraging me to join.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000 And when I was a sophomore, I get the letter in the mail from the ROTC program,
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000 saying, hey, this summer between your sophomore and junior year,
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000 you go to the space of camp at Fort Knox.
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000 And decide, you know, if you like to arm me,
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000 and if you do, then you get signed a contract and joined the ROTC.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000 So I go to Fort Knox, Kentucky, between my sophomore and junior year.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000 Because really, I just kind of wanted to do something different.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000 I guess I was tired of working in the family business.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000 So I forget how many weeks it was.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000 It might have been six weeks or eight weeks.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000 And man, I just loved it.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000 I mean, there's a lot of camaraderie even there.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000 I mean, the drill sergeants, I still remember my drill sergeant's name,
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000 their sergeant, Ogden. He was a short, watery guy,
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000 Vietnam vet. And, you know,
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000 profanity was all in.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000 I mean, you know, the Jodi calls, they could sing whatever they put out there,
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000 we sang and it was pretty profane.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000 And I just loved it. I just loved the physical part of it.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000 I loved, you know, I'm being on the rifle range, you know, the tactical part of it.
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000 So I was all in, you know, when I left Fort Knox, Kentucky,
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000 I signed the ROTC contract and, you know, I was just so thrilled to be part of that.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000 Yeah, so, so then you finished college.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000 And so what year is it?
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000 Yeah, I graduate from high school in 74, graduate from college in 78.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000 And then I went on active duty.
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000 But the thing is, a lot of people don't know this,
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000 and I don't admit it to a lot of people, but it's kind of an interesting story.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000 I was commissioned as a matter of, you know, you're about to admit this to about to know,
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000 I know that, but, you know, I'm still proud of my service,
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000 but I was a medical service core officer.
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000 And the reason I was a medical service core officer is the eyesight in my left eye
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000 is right now it's about 2600.
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000 At that time, it was 2400 non-correctable.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000 I had a lazy eye when I was a kid, it was never corrected.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000 And once you go so long with that, there's no way to correct that eyesight.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000 So because my eyesight in my left eye was so poor,
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000 I couldn't become an infantryman like I wanted to, because most of my buddies
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000 were going infantry or armor, field artillery, combat arms.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000 I was in the commandos at the University of Scranton, which was kind of a kind of a
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000 range or oriented group, proud heritage at the University of Scranton, commandos.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.000 Yeah.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000 And so what is a medical service officer do?
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000 You're in administrative officer, so at Fort Benning, Georgia, where I was first assigned,
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000 I commanded medical platoon in an armor, in an armor battalion.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000 So I wasn't a doctor or anything like that, but I was kind of like the administrative officer
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000 who would lead the medics, provide them the leadership that they needed.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000 There's usually a physician's assistant assigned your platoon as well.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000 But that sort of medical service officer essentially does.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000 They could be a platoon leader in an ambulance platoon, you know, as a lieutenant or a platoon leader in a medical
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000 platoon supporting an infantry battalion or armor battalion, that's sort of a medical service
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000 officer does. So I did that for four years and then, you know, I was assigned up for
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000 bending that I went up the Fort Lewis Washington.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000 And after four years, I left the active duty, mainly because, you know, as a medical service
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000 corps officer would be quite honest with you, it was just something that didn't really interest me that much.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000 And I figured, okay, I did my four years, and I'm going to get out and then I had a decision to make
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000 whether to stay into coma Washington and make a life for myself there, move back to Northeastern Pennsylvania.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000 Well, we ended up doing this moving back to Northeastern Pennsylvania.
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000 I got to pick up a book here for a second to read through that kind of decision making process because
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000 well, I'll just go to the book. You say here, after serving it for Lewis for about two years,
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000 I left active duty in the army in the fall of 1982. We stated to coma Washington,
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000 where I worked as an alcoholism counselor and birdie worked at that's your wife.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000 Worked as a nurse.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000 We enjoyed living in the Northwest, but we decided to move to music for a variety of reasons.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000 First, my dad was getting older. I want to spend time with him.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000 I also wanted to raise my family near my brothers, sisters and friends back in Pennsylvania.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000 And when you say at the humble kitchen table, my plans are hatched and life important life decisions are made.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000 Homes are mortgaged in insurance policies are purchased and weddings are planned.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000 The kitchen table is remarkable. In the winter of 1982, 83,
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000 it was at our kitchen table where two important decisions were made.
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000 The first decision was to leave to coma Washington in the Great Northwest and relocate to my hometown of Moosec, Pennsylvania.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000 The second decision was a bit more adventurous.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000 We decided to make the trip by bicycle.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000 The trip would be self-supported, meaning we would carry our belongings on our bicycles in packs known as Paniers.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000 If I say that right, yes, known as Paniers, we would keep these belongings sparse to save weight only one spoon each.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000 No forks, a small pot to cook and only one bowl. The pot would serve as the other bowl.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000 I drilled holes into the handles of our toothbrushes, ounces mattered.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000 We would carry our home with us, a two person backpacking tent had two sleeping bags that could zip together.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:56.000 Our most precious cargo would be our baby who at the time of our decision was only about nine months old.
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000 There was nothing we could do about controlling the weight of this growing boy we would adjust elsewhere.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000 So you make this decision to that you're going to bike across the country.
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000 Did you had you done any long distance biking before this?
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000 The farther I went before that would be a hundred miles in a ride of century.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000 Did birdie go with you?
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000 Not on a ride of that duration.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000 So you did a little maneuver to get her to say yes to this?
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000 My wife is from Austria.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000 When I was at Fort Benning, she had spent her most of her life in Austria until she was in early 20s.
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000 And then I met her when I was stationed in Fort Benning. She was staying with her and an uncle in Columbus, Georgia.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000 So we had only been married a little less than three years when we made this bicycle trip.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000 And being that she was Austrian and then probably understand the vastness of our country. She agreed to it.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000 She thought it was a four day trip, not a three month trip.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000 Something like that.
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000 And really this book is a great kind of recollection. Did you take notes during this?
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000 Actually, I kept the journal.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000 I was going to say, because you got some really good details in there that bring a lot of life to the story.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000 And I was thinking of myself, there's no, if you have a memory like this, the smartest man that's ever lived.
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000 Not my memory was the journal.
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000 So you got a bunch of great stories.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000 And really, you know, the the subtitle of the book is lessons on life, leadership and love.
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000 And you've got you tell the story and you also work in a bunch of, you know, lessons that you're learning along the way.
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000 You've got some stories in here that are funny. Some of them are not so funny. You got this situation here.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000 And I'm fat, obviously I'm fast forward and through the book. I'm skipping around. But at this point you would, you would.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:57.000 You would talk to a farmer to see if you could stay the nightness field, which was, which is the other weird thing about this book in modern day in the year 2020.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:07.000 A lot of the things that you're doing in this book might not be quite as acceptable in modern times because you're going to random people and say, can we stay in your yard?
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:19.000 Can we stay into back of your house or whatever? So this is one of those situations you see a farmer hey can we set up in your field and and the cool thing was and you point this out a lot is people are a lot of people were, hey yeah no problem, you don't come on in.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000 We'll make, we're making dinner. You want some hot dogs, whatever. So that was neat. But at this time you would set up in this field.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:37.000 It's nice nice open field. There's dry grass everywhere tall dry grass and you sleep the night get some good sleep you wake up in the morning and here we're going to the book.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000 The morning sun brought the promise of another good day of cycling the camp stove proved more than cooperative for cooking oatmeal and boiling water for hot coffee.
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:55.000 Then it did for preparing dinner the night before I looked to the beginning of a great day until I got clumsy just as our pot of water reached a boil for our second cup of coffee.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000 My left foot kicked over the camp stove.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000 This sun drenched carefree morning immediately turned chaotic white gas began to run out of the toppled stove.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:18.000 The flame from the burner wasting no time setting the dry grass ablaze the wind howled from the west and famed the flames expanding the fire the flame shot up to about eight feet in the air and cinched my eyebrows everything seemed to move in slow motion.
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:32.000 I had the sense that my life flash before my eyes then we flung into action birdie right at the stove and I put my fire fighting skills to the test my only chance was to create a fire break by stamping down the tall grass and that's exactly what I did.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000 It worked the fire fizzled out after burning only a few square yards in the field. It was a frantic way to begin our morning.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000 There was no fire or smoke damage to the art tent sleeping bags bicycles or to Stephen's trailer.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000 That's your now I think when you left you was 18 months 15 months old.
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000 Stephen did not recognize the seriousness of the situation.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000 We had a hard time getting him to stop laughing at our antics.
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000 So this is the kind of things that you talk about in this book.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Some of the lessons that you learn, you know, another section here.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:19.000 You're just talking about what you're learning. It says throughout our cross country bike journey. We were faced with countless decisions about which way to go and which path to take.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:33.000 What I learned was that the path we decided upon was always the right one was not so much about which path we chose, but how we chose to negotiate it. It was all about attitude.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000 So those are some of the lessons that you learned on this trip.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000 And the books really just kind of filled with a bunch of, you know, funny stories, good stories, lessons learned.
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000 And people definitely get this book so that you can kind of kind of get that background.
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000 But eventually you you make it across country.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000 You make it back to music PA.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.000 And there's all these things that happen on the way. You kind of become a minor celebrity in the biking world for sure.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000 Maybe in the country, but in music PA it's like you're a town hero, right?
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:30.000 Or maybe it's Steven your son is the ultimate town hero because he's the poor kid that had to, you know, survive with his crazy parents who bike across the states with him in a trailer.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000 Well, I think the real hero is my wife, Bertie. I'm indeed, indeed.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:45.000 For her to make, first of all, like you said, agreed to make the trip and then actually make the trip never once won. Never once said, hey, why don't we, you know, pack it in and take a grey home bus home.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000 I mean, I think she's the unsung hero for sure. What did you guys average?
00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:03.000 You know, 60 miles, 70 miles, 80 miles, you know, it all depended. We'd get up in the morning. You know, I talk about setting goals and intermediate goals or all the mid goal was northeers depends on the way.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000 But we'd get up in the morning and look at a map.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:16.000 The side, what time we wanted to make it to that day based on terrain and other factors and then we would set off for it. And usually was between 60 to 80 miles.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000 So when you get back now, you're out of the army and you know you're going into what's the business now morphed into?
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000 Well, the business was was very big.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:38.000 They were probably about, I'd say, about 40 employees working there at the time. And again, it was everything that you had already mentioned, you know, garage use cars,
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000 Towing service, a very large boat sales and service business and a bicycle shop.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000 Call of that. You know, could you believe all that stuff and it took up about a block in the town of movies?
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:01.000 Where are they using boats? Oh, there's plenty of lakes and Pennsylvania. Fishing is very popular there in water skiing as well.
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000 So you, but you stay in the reserves.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:17.000 No, actually, well, I did. But when I get back to Pennsylvania, I didn't even know what the, I ended up joining a national guard. But when I got there, I had no plan to continue my military service.
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000 Okay, so I got that wrong. You didn't stay in the reserves. You would actually left active duty complete.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000 When I left active duty in Washington, I got in a reserve unit up there.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000 And, and then I moved back to Pennsylvania with no plan to continue my military service.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:44.000 But somebody said to me, after about nine months being back, they said, hey, why don't you go down to the armory in Scranton and talk to guys down there about joining a national guard. I had no idea what the national guard was.
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:51.000 I certainly did. Explain the difference between the reserves and the national guard. I think everyone knows what active duty is active duty is what you think of when you think of the military.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000 You're in the military. You're in the army. You're in the Navy. You're in the air force. You're in the Marine Corps. You're in the Coast Guard. You're in one of those. That's what you do every day. That's the deal.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000 Reserves and national guard. Explain those a little bit.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000 Army reserve is you have a federal mission. I mean, your main mission would be to get deployed to conduct operations overseas.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:24.000 In the national guard, you have that same federal mission. But then you also have a state mission. So, in the national guard, generally during peace time or study state is under the the command and control of the governor of the state.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:33.000 So, that's the main difference. The reserves are not under the command and control of the governor in the national guard. The national guard, the units are.
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:41.000 And it's usually the national guard that gets called up when hurricane hits when there's bad weather when something like that happens. Even to some kind of civil unrest.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000 Yes. It's generally the national guard because they are controlled by the state's governors.
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000 That's exactly right. The governor does not have any authority to call up reserve units, but they do have authority to call up national guard units.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:02.000 Although there's some talk about changing that, and I'm not sure where we are with that right now with the laws, but generally the national guard is under the command and control of the governor.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000 And so, so that life is similar to the reserves, I assume, and I remember this since I was a little kid.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000 I would hear on the new or hear the advertisement they'd say, one weekend a month, two weeks in the summer.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.000 Yes.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.000 Is that similar?
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:26.000 That that was and it was it was that way for the most part up until 911 and then after 911 everything changed with the national guard.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000 How about the first go for any impact on the first go for not a lot not a lot primarily because
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:44.000 It was was a lot of reserves were called up. I don't know if any national guard units were called up for to go for there may have been if there was there wasn't a lot.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000 Probably primarily, just to go units in the guard if they were called up at all.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:59.000 And again, it was obviously very quick. I mean, you know, 100 hours, you know, you know, the buildup certainly was longer, but you know, 100 hour war there.
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000 So it wasn't very long.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000 And so you're doing your one weekend a month and you're doing two weeks in the summer time.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000 And other than that, you're living your life, you're building the business,
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000 Yes, you're selling boats and bicycles cars and all that.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.000 Toast stuff.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000 And you're raising your kids, how many kids?
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000 Well, I my second son Timothy was born in 1984.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000 So yeah, I had Stephen and Timothy and that's the two children that we have.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000 And this whole time you're getting advanced in REC.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.000 Right. And this is something that we would always, hmm, what's a nice way of putting this. So when the seal teams, there's reserve seals.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000 And the, but there's not many of them. There's more now. Okay, let me let me refraz this when I was younger in the seal teams.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000 There was not a lot of reserve seals.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000 No one really even knew about it. And most guys just frankly stayed in the seal teams.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:11.000 And if they got out, they got out. They were done. Right. You know, they got out. And so there wasn't a lot of reserves. So guys that were in the reserves would make rank really fast.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000 Like way faster than a normal seal, at least it seemed that way. And at least we held that grudge against them.
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000 So if someone showed up for their weekend drill and they were a high ranking guy, you're a reserve. Is you know what you're talking about.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:34.000 But that's what's happening while you're in the reserves, or the National Guard, even though you're only working one week in a month. You're still advancing in REC.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000 Yeah, but it's different. A National Guard rank is much slower. Okay, much slower.
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000 Just the way it is. I never knew it was that way in the reserve seals that they made rank quicker.
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:57.000 Yeah, and I don't know if it's like that anymore. And I don't even know if it's just the way that I was raised by the five of the guys that would look at the reserve, and say that guy was the only made rank.
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:07.000 Because he's in the reserves otherwise he's too much of an idiot. You know, it might have just been some prejudice against the reserves that was instilled with me by the active duty guys.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:16.000 Yeah, but yeah, I guess my point is for people that don't understand the National Guard reserves is that you're still advancing in your career.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Oh, you are. Yeah, and you know, you have your civilian responsibility, but you also have your military responsibility. So all of the things that go along with maintaining military standards still exist, even though you're drilling, you know, in theory, one week in a month and two week annual training
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:44.000 at some other time near usually in the summer, but you've in terms of physical fitness standards, you've got to maintain those physical fitness standards on your own.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:41:02.000 Because you know, you have US Army on your uniform. And that was very important. One thing I did want to back up on a little bit though, Jocco is is, you know, when I came back when I did make that decision to join the National Guard, because the guys there seem like people I wanted to work with.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:17.000 And remember, I was a medical service corps officer when I left active duty. I got branch transferred to become an infantry officer when I joined the National Guard. And this was about 1984, 85 time frame.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:33.000 And really, I became an infantry infantry officer without having to go through any additional training. It was essentially at that time. And I don't know if it had happened today or not. But again, we're talking about 40 years ago almost.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:45.000 You know, it was basically some paperwork that was adjusted to branch qualifying me as an infantry officer. And then I took command of an infantry company.
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:58.000 Yeah, in West Pitz, in Pennsylvania. And I commanded that company for about four years and just due to a lot of good teammates there and good soldiers there. The company really performed very well so well.
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:22.000 And we were given the honor to go to the National Training Center at Fort Ouro and California as an opposing force company, opt for company, which was a big deal for us. I mean, that the guys were psyched back then. I think this happened in 86 or so, memory serves me correctly. That was a big deal for us.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:31.000 Yeah, and that's that's actually an awesome thing. So opt for just to explain people that are civilian, supposing force. That means you're going to be the role players that are going to be pretending to be the bad guys.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:47.000 And I my seals when I was the training commander out on the west coast, I had a pack of guys and that's what they did. They not only taught, but then they were opt for as well. And the thing that the thing that is very important about it. There's multiple things that are very important about it. Number one.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:58.000 The seals that we put through training were never going to face a tougher enemy than the other seals that we're playing opt for. Never. There would never be there's never going to be a tougher enemy ever.
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:15.000 And number two, when you're on opt for you learn how to think like the bad guys, you learn what it looks like you learn, how to set things up. And so then you can counter those tactics. So it's a it's a very important.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000 It's a very important learning process. So for you guys and you probably went out there for a pretty big chunk of time.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000 Yeah, we were out there. I think it was at least three weeks. You know, a normal annual training is is two weeks, but we were out there for an extended period of time.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000 Did they send you to any schools or anything when you became an infantry officer?
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000 Me. Yeah. Well, that's the the next story is when I left command of that company after about four years.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000 I just knew I had to do something to gain more credibility.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:44:00.000 And so I sought out and thankfully I was able to go to the infantry officer at Vanskors the resident course at Fort Benning for six months, which was great. And then I while I was there, I fought to get in the Ranger School.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000 And so I started Ranger School the day my class graduated the infantry officer at Vanskors.
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000 So I didn't go to the graduation. We call it IOSC at that time infantry officer Vanskors.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000 So the day my class graduated was my first day setting foot in the Ranger School at Harmony Church.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:28.000 And it was just something I had wanted to do for a very long time because a lot of my classmates back at the University of Scranton went to Ranger School.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000 Just something I really had my heart set on just like you wanted to go through to seal training.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000 And it was a very defining period of my life to go through Ranger School.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000 How old were you in New Winter Ranger School?
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000 Yeah, I started when I was 33 and hadn't my birthday there.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000 So I graduated when I was 34 years old. So I was one of the older guys graduating from Ranger School.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000 That's old.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000 For Ranger School that's that's all.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000 There's been older guys graduate.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.000 Really?
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000 Oh yeah, I think there's I heard stories about a sergeant major who graduated when he was 45 years old.
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.000 I salute that guy.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:15.000 Yeah, but I tell you it was it was an ask kicker for me, you know, and, and, but I was, you know, just didn't want to quit and just kept with it and thank God.
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000 I made it through.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.000 So were you a captain at that point?
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:19.000 I was a captain.
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000 Yeah, because I was a captain when I left active duty.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000 And so you're still a captain.
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000 You were still a captain for a long time.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000 This is what you're talking about the reserves.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000 Exactly.
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000 So you're a captain.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000 But you go to Ranger School.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000 You go to the infantry officers course.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000 So now you're starting to feel like like an infantryman.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000 Like I've got like I've got the requisite training that that is necessary for one to perform their job.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000 The way you should perform your job.
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000 And obviously it was, was your dad still running the business?
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:54.000 Yes.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000 And so he took, he was okay with you being gone for, yes, ten months.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000 Yes.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000 And that's about how long I was going.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000 Did he, did he, did he ride you about it?
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000 Oh, he was stoked on it.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.000 Very proud.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:09.000 Yeah.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000 Because I could also see a little bit of, you go play army.
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:13.000 I'll be back here working.
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:14.000 No, no.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000 He was very proud.
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000 And that kind of attitude at all.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000 And yeah, that's, yeah, you said he was in the army air corps.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.000 Yeah.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000 What, so what year did you graduate from Ranger School?
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000 1991.
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000 So I went, I went to the advanced course, the infantry officer,
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000 Vance course I started in August of 1990.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000 And we graduated in February.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000 I think it was February 2nd.
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000 And that's the day I started,
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000 Ranger School February 2nd, 1991.
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000 So that's the goal for happened while you were at the infantry course.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.000 Right.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000 What were you thinking about that?
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000 Was it just kind of, no, no, I mean, very interested, obviously,
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000 and everything that was going on.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000 But, you know, didn't, you know, didn't have to play a role in that.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000 Did that drive you crazy?
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000 Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000 And, you know, when, when you're in the army, you want to do your job because that's what we train for.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000 So yeah, absolutely.
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000 The goal for goes over really quick.
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000 Do you remember, so I remember, so I was, I graduated boot camp.
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000 I went to boot camp in September, September 13th, 1990.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.000 Okay.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000 So the war kicked off after that.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000 But I remember I'm watching CNN with a bunch of other Navy guys.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:42.000 And the report, CNN was saying there's going to be 40,000 casualties in the first 48 hours.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.000 Right.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.000 I remember that.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000 And I remember thinking, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to get mine because, you know, I was, I mean,
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000 you might have thought you wanted to go to war when you were 33 years old.
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000 I was 19.
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000 And I was, you know, completely was was hoping to go to war.
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000 And yeah, so I remember watching that thinking, oh, I'm definitely going to get my chance because there's 40,000 casualties.
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000 That means this thing's going to last a while and that means I'll be able to go.
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:10.000 Oh, yeah.
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000 Which I know I know people, um, I know it's hard to understand that concept of wanting to go to war.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000 But hey, you're young, you're dumb.
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000 And that's what you want to do. Like you said, you train for it. That's what you want to do.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000 And the thing is, Jack, you know, your buddies are going.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000 And you feel like, man, you know, my buddies are going. I want to be there with them.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000 I think there's a lot of that. And you know, and when I say buddies, I mean, you're using that in a very loose term.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000 But I mean, my fellow, you know, sailors are going. My fellow soldiers are going.
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000 Fellow Marines are going. So I want to be a part of it. You know, I think it's that type attitude.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000 So that war, like you said, it's over $100. And now you're back to work.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000 You're, you're, you're back.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000 Hawking bicycles. Right.
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000 I mean, you got the experience. You must have been a hell of a salesman and sell them bicycles.
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000 We had a pretty successful. Stop for a time there. Yeah.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000 Time goes by. You're still getting advanced and rank eventually. You make major.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000 Where are you on September 11th?
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000 On September 11th.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:30.000 I am a colonel who had just successfully commanded a brigade for over three years,
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000 55th brigade, which is a Pennsylvania National Guard Brigade.
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:41.000 And in the sum, I, I left command in the summer of, I'm trying to remember here.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000 No, I different.
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000 I spent a year in Lithuania into your 2000.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000 So I come back from Lithuania in January, and that was at on National Guard duty.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000 Yes, yeah, National Guard duty. I was spending a year in Lithuania because Lithuania is a state partner of the Pennsylvania National Guard.
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000 I get getting into that in a little bit, but to answer your question, I get back from Lithuania in January 2001.
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.000 And then I take command of 55th brigade in July of 2001.
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000 So I was actually in command of 55th brigade at the time.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:37.000 And what happened is I took 2000 soldiers from the 55th brigade over to Europe in 2002 to do a forced protection mission there at the army bases in four different countries in Europe, Germany, Italy and Netherlands and Belgium.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000 While the active duty troops are getting prepared to deploy.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000 The deploy either to Afghanistan or as, as happened to Iraq.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 So I took 2000 soldiers over to Europe.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000 I said summer 2002, we spent a little over six months over there doing forced pro.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000 For me, that was an honor.
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.000 I mean, I, I never thought I would have a chance to serve overseas to command soldiers overseas.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000 So to me, that was a great honor.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000 And, and did our mission as well as we could do it and the soldiers performed very well over there.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000 And came back from that mission.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000 And then after about a little over three years, almost four years, I left command of the 55th brigade.
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000 So that, that mission, the Lithuanian year trip that was one year.
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000 Yeah, yeah, what was that job?
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000 Okay, that job is, and let me explain the state partnership program real quick.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:52.000 Right after the fall of the Soviet Union, the US, European commander, which is a forced, our general he has to combat command, you come, they call it is the abbreviation.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:08.000 He wanted to develop an engagement strategy with former Soviet republics or worse-off-pack countries to just create better relations with these countries as they were leaving the Soviet Union's sphere of influence.
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:20.000 And so he talked to the director of the Army National Guard or the Chief of the National Guard about getting National Guard states partnered with some of these countries.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000 So I don't know how the decision was made, but Pennsylvania was partnered with Lithuania.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:35.000 And as part of that partnership, as Lithuania was trying to learn how does United States military operate?
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000 Because they wanted to pattern themselves after us.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000 We had various kernels from the Pennsylvania National Guard, go over to Lithuania.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:53.000 Got it. I spent anywhere from a year to three years over there. So in 2000, I was tapped to go over there and it was just something I was really excited about.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000 Because again, this is prior 9-11, if that man, I'm going to get a chance to serve as a kernel overseas.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000 I mean, this is great, because who could have predicted 9-11? I mean, I couldn't predict 9-11 at that point.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:15.000 So I thought that was going to be my only shot to serve overseas as a commissioned officer. So I was very excited about it. Did you get to take your wife on that?
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000 No, it was on a company.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000 Yeah, but my wife, I see that that is just how my wife bearing is. When I call her an unsung heroshy really is, I mean, she supported me through everything.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000 We've been married, we're going to be married 40 years the September.
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.000 So if she didn't leave me after that bicycle trip, you know, I guess I thought, y'all guys, she's never going to leave, but put it in the test early.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.000 And again, I come home one day and say, hey, Barity, you know, one of the generals from the Pennsylvania National Guard wants me to go over to Lithuania for a year.
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000 How do you feel about that? She said, John, you do whatever you think you need to do.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000 That's her whole attitude.
00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:04.000 So you did that mission, then you come home and then September 11th happens and now you deploy again as a as a brigade commander.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:21.000 Yeah, with 2000 soldiers over there in in Europe and the thing I'm most proud of is the fact that if we had this planary problems, we handled it, you know, very quickly our soldiers performed well.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:36.000 Then in embarrass anybody did their job very professionally as they were conducting force pro at these at these bases because again after 90 11, you know, you know, what was going to happen with terrorist attacks at our installations over there.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:54.000 So very proud of the way the soldiers performed. We had group. I had three battalions task organized to my 2000 soldier brigade and leadership at all levels function very well right down to the soldier level and they perform one quick story. I had a I had a former Navy seal.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000 I'm sorry of I guess even the Navy seal, but he caused problems.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:10.000 He really did another this guy leaves the seals he gets a job working for this pharmaceutical company because he had some type of degree that he got when he when he left the seals.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:39.000 He was making $250,000 a year with his pharmaceutical company Navy seal now he's a staff sergeant in my brigade working for peanuts whatever a staff sergeant made so he leaves a $250,000 a year job to perform over there as a staff sergeant. I mean just stories like that, what cards have happened all the time where they they leave these very very lucrative positions to get, you know, pay as a as a staff sergeant.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:50.000 Specialist, which is a knee for you know, I mean it's as is incredible the sacrifice. These these great Americans make yeah that's that's true service right there.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000 So you come home from that deployment and now it's 2002 we got yeah we we.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:11.000 Yeah we got there in the summer of 2003 so we got there in the late summer of 2002 and we get back home after the first year 2003.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:24.000 And at this point what one of your sons is in the reserves or is the national guard my son Timothy was in the national guard okay.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:41.000 And so you're seeing September 11 unfold yeah at what point are you thinking that the the call might come to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan for myself yeah yeah for yourself well our second brigade.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:54.000 And so we got got notice that they were going to be deploying over to to Iraq and I think they got the notice.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:09.000 They actually got mobilized in January 2005 so they got the notice about six months prior to that so we were either brigade commander yet or no no I was not I I had left 55 brigade after commanding there for three years a little over three years.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:23.000 And so I was selected to become a general officer so I was actually at our state headquarters in an 07 position waiting to get promoted when I heard the second brigade was going to be going over to Iraq now.
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:38.000 Jack or this is the weird thing when I heard second brigade was going to get mobilizing over to Iraq something told me I was going to go with them and I don't know what it was I just believed I was going to go over there with that brigade and.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:56.000 And the way it happened is when they actually got mobilized and they we went that that brigade went to Camp Shelby for about five months to train a camp Shelby Mississippi and this was January January 2005.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:11.000 I get a call on a Friday from the division commander the 28th infantry division that said hey the current brigade commander went through the readiness processing there at Camp Shelby was like the first or second day on the ground there.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:25.000 And there was a medical issue no fault of his own very honorable man who wanted to go with this brigade but had a medical issue that was going to prevent him from going over.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:41.000 And so I think that's the reason why I'm going to make sure he couldn't go and so Sunday comes he gets to squallified and so my division commander called me back on Sunday and said hey John he didn't make a through could you be there on Wednesday.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000 And so it's like absolutely was the division commander a friend of yours.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:56.000 No I mean we had a professional relationship I won't say was a friend. Did you had you told him that you were ready to rock and roll as I actually told him.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:09.000 Months prior to that that hey if anything and I don't even know what I was thinking but I said if anything happens where you need me to go with this brigade I just want you to keep me in mind.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000 And he did and I was thankful for that just because it was an honor to be able to go over there and do that that job.
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:24.000 Did they put your your general selection on hold? Yes, I was basically put on hold I'll tell you the truth and I'm not saying.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000 Honestly if I had a choice and I truly meant this because I knew there was a chance I might not get promoted.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000 Because I was taken on this mission because just away it is.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:45.000 But if I had a choose between the two serving and combat with with those soldiers and Marines or getting promoted to general serving and combat would be the thing.
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.000 And luckily you found this out as soon as the work up kind of started as soon as the training started.
00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:16.000 Yeah, you went down there on so you missed two days right I mean yeah you missed nothing exactly I mean I was down there yeah within the first five six days of their training startup and kind of an interesting story I want to tell you the kind of links the the time we had in Europe with the time of me going to Camp Shelby to begin command in the brigade.
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:26.000 When we first got to Europe in 2002 I had a decision to make as a brigade commander 2000 soldiers spread throughout four countries in Europe.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000 And I made the decision that hey when you're off duty you could drink alcohol.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000 I was going to tell these guys you're over here in Europe and you're not going to be able to go out and have a beer.
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:53.000 And that's one thing I believe in is not not setting you know not not setting out a standard or a rule that you're probably not going to be able to enforce anyway and plus it doesn't make sense just because a guy puts on a military uniform doesn't make them stupid.
01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:06.000 You know what I mean and so these are adults so I said yeah you know you could drink over there but I said just going to let everybody know you get in trouble you're going to be disciplined.
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000 We had a guy who's there about two weeks gets drunk gets in a fight with a German civilian.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:26.000 Throw as this Germans civilian off a balcony the Germans civilian loses an eye so we court martial this guy and he ends up in the stock a manheim busted them down from an E6 to an E1 from a staff sergeant to a private.
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:40.000 Then I had another decision to make do I discharge this guy from from the army. So I talked to the battalion commander and I said hey what do you think in the battalion commander obviously knew this guy better than I did.
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:50.000 And he said you know he is a good soldier you know he needs alcoholism counseling etc etc but he said I believe he's worth retaining.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:00.000 So I listened to this battalion commander said so I retained them. Then on Christmas day this is about maybe four months later or something I don't know four five months later.
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:09.000 Christmas day and by the way while I was over there with these two thousand soldiers I was on the road constantly just going doing circulation seeing how the soldiers are going.
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:19.000 Christmas day I wake up and I say to my driver I say we're driving up the manheim today it's about an hour and a half north of where my headquarters was.
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000 So I want to see the sky in the stock aid it was Christmas day something just told me to go visit him.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000 So I go up.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:39.000 Guard brings them out into the visitors area I was only visitor there that day and he was just blown away when he saw me he goes currently you know it's Christmas day you're here to see me I said listen I said.
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:49.000 You you screwed up your pain your dues you're still one of my soldiers I said I wanted to come see how you're doing let you know that we're still thinking of you're still on ours.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.000 As somehow to family was doing all that I mean you felt like crappy in in that the tension facility.
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000 Fast forward I didn't think another thing about it left that was done there's my duty to do that I did it.
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:12.000 And fast forward to the first day on the ground a camp shell b after I went down there to take command of that brigade walking through the.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000 Barric's area and there's four soldiers standing outside of the barracks and one of them.
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000 Come sprinting over to me you know stands there to tension salute it's specialist and he for.
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000 Same guy and he goes you probably don't remember me goes but you came to see me in the stock aid on Christmas day.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:41.000 He goes I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate that he goes I never forgot that and then he yells over to the three other soldiers that were standing outside of the barracks with them.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.000 Because a lot of guys didn't know who I was you know who's this new guy coming to take command of brigade heels over to those three soldiers he said this is Colonel Gransky we're in good hands with him.
01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:11.000 And and I'm sure you know coming from any for that mental lot if you know what I mean. Yeah and but it just shows that you just try to do the right thing for people you know and you don't just discard somebody just because they made a mistake and now this guy was going to the most violent place on the face of the earth to continue to serve our country.
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000 Did you guys know you were going to Ramadi we learned while we were at Shelby.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:32.000 We learned we're going to Ramadi and then we kept thinking man are they going to change their mind because you know we were getting you know we were getting all the classified report you know what was going on over there as we saw how violent was and by the way.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:42.000 Second brigade second infantry division was over there at the time that's who we did the really from place within those soldiers and Marines who worked for that brigade commander.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:52.000 Gary Patton who's a outstanding American he ended up retiring as a major general very proud of his leadership over there with that with that unit.
01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:08.000 But we saw how violent it was and with that man they're going to send a you know our brigade over there and they did and I actually talked to a retired three star who was the MNC I commander at the time.
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000 After he retired and I said sir I said.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000 I just I have to ask you why why did this end of national guard brigade to this most violent place on earth.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000 And he said well I was talking to the first army commander and he said you guys were ready.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:36.000 And he goes then I talked to my boss who was the MNF commander and he said he asked me my opinion he said sir we've been taking risk everywhere else over here I think we'll take some more risk and put.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:44.000 Second brigade 28th infantry division and Ramadi but those soldiers who were part of that brigade and the Marines who were task organized to us.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:54.000 That remarkable job just because of leadership at every level below me and just so proud of the work those guys did in Ramadi.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000 How well did the work up prepare you the training cycle that you did and you guys went out to for her when as well right.
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000 We spent a month out of four to one as part of that train up you know.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000 Counter and certainty doctrine wasn't even published at that time.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000 Coind doctrine didn't exist until after we got back home after 2006 that's when it was published.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.000 So we were given the best training that the army was able to give us being with a new at that time.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000 But certainly not as advanced as it as it became.
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000 So the army did the best they could do with with the training they gave us.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000 And the what did you guys have for armor?
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000 I'll tell you when we got over there.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000 We had what we called Hillbilly armor.
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000 It was basically armor that was welded on to humvies.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000 It wasn't a armored humvies.
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:07.000 And we had a fight to get the a armored humvies we needed in Ramadi because with that Hillbilly armor there was a slight gap in the door.
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000 I mean you could actually see space in between when the door closed and the rest of the vehicle and you know how the ID threat was over in Ramadi.
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000 We had over a thousand ID's used against us while we were there.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000 And without the right protection, we were just going to take even more casualties than we did take.
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000 And by the way the brigade that was there before us took in the 80s and killed an action.
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000 We took 82 killed an action and about 260 who were wounded seriously enough who had to be evacuated back to the United States.
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000 That doesn't count the ones who were wounded who were able to stay there.
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000 And then the brigade after us who you worked with for a lot of your time there.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000 Took about the same amount of casualties we took.
01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:00.000 You know, every brigade that was in Ramadi, every army brigade for three consecutive brigades were all taking into 80s in terms of KIA.
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000 So you need the protection.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.000 And we fought for the protection and we finally got the the up armored humvies that we needed to be able to better perform our mission.
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:19.000 Did you guys deploy all at once and straight into Ramadi? Is that how it happened or how it happened or how it happened?
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000 I'll tell you.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000 My brigade at Shelby.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000 I had over 35 different states contributing soldiers to my brigade.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000 I mean that's a me so you know you want to train with you want to go to war with the unit that you've been training with.
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:44.000 But because at that time in 2005 a lot of national guard had been used at that time.
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000 They I had soldiers from 35 different states showing up at Camp Shelby.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000 So now we can start training together as a brigade team.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.000 And the other interesting thing, there was not a direct support of Philar Turley battalion in the guard available to deploy with us.
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000 So we had to use a general support Philar Turley battalion. The difference.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000 The fire support element. A fire support element is where the four observers are.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000 Usually in a direct support.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000 Philar Turley battalion. There's 135 fire supporters. The guys who call in the fire.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000 In a G.S. General support artillery battalion.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000 There's no F.S.E. because they use four observers from the direct support artillery battalions.
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000 We had to cobble together 135 soldier fire support element while we're on the ground.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000 A camp Shelby and that took months to get everybody there.
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000 In groups of two's and groups of three's to put this fire support element together.
01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:02.000 The reason I say this is this is just to credit to these national guard soldiers who came together like they did and then did their jobs.
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000 That's why I'm telling that story. It's not a knock on anybody. It's not a knock on the army.
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:22.000 It's a credit to these soldiers who were able to come together and then form themselves as a team to do the hard work that they had to do in the most violent place on the face of the earth for a year.
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:30.000 Interesting. I'm thinking about a podcast that we actually a couple podcasts that we just did about the Boer war and the British went down there.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:40.000 And what's interesting is it was only a very small part that I mentioned and the reason I mentioned it on the podcast was because the T.A.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000 Which is the territory of the army which is the reserves in England.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000 There was a they gave several examples but one specific example where the guys that were reserved.
01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:00.000 So the guys that weren't professional soldiers in many cases were the first ones to say hey wait a second the way we're doing this doesn't make sense.
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000 So they had I would I guess they had their their minds were more open and and they were.
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.000 They could adapt where they weren't so rigid and I thought I was I was thinking when you were saying oh they made a decision to send the.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:26.000 The you know the national guard there if I was the commander that maybe something that you wait and go look I need someone that's going to attack this problem maybe a little bit different so that's an.
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000 Interesting concept but also just knowing and you know I mentioned this at the beginning.
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:40.000 The effort that your soldiers and Marines took to take care of us when we showed up.
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:50.000 And literally saved our guys lives there was missions I mean there's a specific mission that layfab and who wrote these books with me.
01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:03.000 He was gonna go he was getting from a special operations group was going to do an operation and he was going to take some of his you know his seals and is Iraqi soldiers they were going to go and help them.
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:18.000 And he brought it to you brought the plan to one of you know one of your majors out of Vermont I want to say yeah and I know exactly who that guy was yeah I do too and I mean he's just and he looked at life and said.
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:27.000 If you go on the street you're going to get blown up and you know it life said life you know a seal team guy a special operations guy said thank you.
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:40.000 And he listened and that that was our attitude we were so thankful and grateful that you know you all helped us so much when we got on the ground and just the the the other thing you know we just had.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:50.000 Complete respect and admiration as I said in the beginning because look we're looking at you get you know a lot of the a lot of you all were looking at us like oh these guys are highly trained.
01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:13.000 And we're looking back at you saying you've been in gun fights every day for the last 11 months yeah so I can't say enough to thank you and everybody from from that brigade that was there on the ground that welcome us that didn't give us any attitude that didn't give us any they just wanted to help and it was just it was an awesome thing to to be a part of and to see.
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000 And to see.
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000 So you guys know you're going into a nightmare.
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000 Yeah.
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000 When you got on the ground like what was the first thing that you said to yourself.
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000 This is real.
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000 That's funny.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:41.000 You know I had a personal security detachment which was a platoon out of the brass canash on guard and the platoon leader.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000 Awesome leader Jock Smith is fantastic lieutenant.
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000 We were out and I was out a lot okay but always with the purpose.
01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:06.000 I could tell you a little bit background on that in a minute but we were out there shortly after we were there and and I we have many IED issues against.
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:20.000 I did that or particularly patrol but I did that Nate's nobody was hurt it was relatively not significant and me and Jack look at each other and we go you know there's actually people trying to kill us.
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:29.000 And it's kind of like yeah reality set in very quickly and it was like like there's people actually like trying to kill us.
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000 You know and I think that reality set in for everybody pretty quickly.
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000 How did you, what was your approach when you showed up?
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000 So by the time we got there in April of 06,
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000 you guys had really secured like all the main MSRs going
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000 into the city.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000 What was your kind of larger operational approach
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000 when you showed up?
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000 Yeah.
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000 I'd say it was a couple of different phases.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000 The first phase was really getting situational
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000 understanding of what was going on.
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000 And the second brigade, second infantry division,
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000 really helped us do that.
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000 Then the phase after that,
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000 I like to think of as getting the,
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000 was a leader engagement phase.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000 We're really trying to get the shakes and the governor,
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000 probably remember the governor.
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000 Moom.
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000 Moom.
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000 To really support our effort there.
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000 We saw, we didn't see many e-moms there to be honest with you.
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000 It was mainly the shakes and the governor we were dealing with.
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000 And we made a lot of headway there.
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000 And then the phase after that,
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000 I like to call the murder and intimidation phase
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000 for then surgeons actually got the upper hand on murdering
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000 key shakes, which hurt our leader engagement,
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000 which had been successful.
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000 And then the last phase I like to call
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000 sudden in the conditions for the next brigade to come through.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000 And that's where we were trying to do our best.
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000 To set up combat outpost in certain areas where we could then stay there.
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000 Now this is the thing you may not know about our brigade.
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000 Remember, we had from Ramadi to Habaniah.
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:21.000 In May of 2006, I was visited by two very senior generals.
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000 And the question they asked,
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000 what you need to control Ramadi.
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000 And Ramadi was very chaotic at that time because of murder and intimidation.
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000 And a lack of us able to engage leaders very effectively because of the murder and
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000 intimidation of the shakes.
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000 And what I explained to them is you needed a brigade and
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000 Ramadi proper itself if you want to control it.
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000 A brigade in Habaniah and then another brigade up in Jazeera,
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000 which was north of the Euphrates River.
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000 And the one general put his head in his hand
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000 and just kind of like shook his head and he said to the two his senior.
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000 He said, sir, that's an entire division.
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000 And at that point in time, they were trying to downsize.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000 And he didn't push back on me though.
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000 He basically just realized that.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000 I'm going to do that.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.000 One thing that happened when we were leaving and the next brigade was coming in.
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000 Five five Easting, which was just east of Camp Currigator.
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000 That's where their area of operation ended.
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000 So they didn't have Habaniah.
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000 So the brigade after us came in with.
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000 They were able to put three additional battalions into Ramadi.
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000 Okay, we didn't.
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000 All right, so they were able instead of putting a battalion in Habaniah,
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000 they were able to put it in Ramadi.
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000 And then they came in with two additional battalions head quarters besides that.
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000 So they had from what I understand, they had three additional battalions head quarters,
01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000 one full battalion plus another four companies.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:13.000 So one of the reasons thing started to change is because they were able to mass more troops in that area.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000 And as a difference between fighting a large scale combat operation and fighting in uncertainty,
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000 in a large scale combat operation, you don't want to mass troops.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000 You want to mass the effects of your combat power.
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000 You see, if you're fighting a near-peer or a peer, you don't want to mass troops.
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000 You want to mass the effects of combat power.
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000 When you're fighting an insurgency, that's where you want to mass troops.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:46.000 And I think what the coin doctrine came out with was was one counterinsurgent for every 20 civilians that are in that city.
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000 And Ramadi had a population of around 400,000.
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000 And we had nowhere near what the coin doctrine called for.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000 So we were struggling with that.
01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:05.000 So I believe in the hamburger Hill principle of never ordering a patrol to go into an area.
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000 That we weren't prepared to put a combat outpost in and stay in.
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:20.000 I saw it as stupid to send a patrol into an area for two or three hours just to do a friggin patrol and come right back out again.
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:31.000 Because I could deal with losing a soldier or a marine if there was a purpose, a good purpose to lose that soldier or marine.
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:41.000 I had to have a hard time explaining to a mother or a father why their marine or soldier got killed for just the sake of going in there for three hours and coming back out again.
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000 If it was to put a combat outpost in, I could accept that.
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000 You see what I'm saying?
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000 So when I say the hamburger Hill concept because you know hamburger Hill, take the hill and then leave.
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000 It's kind of like, why do you want to do that?
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000 And I was dead set against that.
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:05.000 And I think that's well, well, once the one one showed up, they had enough people that we could go in, set up a combat outpost.
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:13.000 And then what you're doing is patrolling to clear bad guys because you're there and it's a different game.
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000 You know, you mentioned the murder and intimidation of the shakes and this was all happening.
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000 I mean, I arrived in May.
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000 Yes, I arrived in May.
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000 And so this was kind of, was it still happening?
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:38.000 I remember we're reading the Intel reports and from what I remember, there was like a 1, 48 hour period, a 1 very short period of time,
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:47.000 where seven or eight senior shakes were murdered and the rest of them almost all of the rest of them.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000 Well, a large portion of the rest of them left.
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000 This is what happened in probably around the September timeframe.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.000 And I'd be talking to the governor in the shakes about once a week.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000 Starting in September, they started to see that a lot of what they were telling us, we were starting to change the way we conducted operations.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000 I give you an example.
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:19.000 When I first got there, we would send patrols into homes without Intel, just to search the homes.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000 So how would you like it if you're in a house with your wife and two kids and all of a sudden this army patrol comes in and says,
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000 You know, just for the hell of it, we're going to start looking through the drawers in your bedroom dresser.
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000 And so the shakes were complaining about that.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000 It's like, you know what?
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000 That makes sense to me.
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:46.000 So I said to our guys, listen, we're not going to go into a search of a home unless there's targeted intelligence that gives us a reason to,
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000 because otherwise we're just making enemies of good people and turning neutrals to be helping the intelligence.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000 You don't want to do that.
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000 So, you know, that was one example.
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:04.000 There was another outpost that we had north of Kyrriganore up by a hospital that was up in that area, which I took down.
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000 And the main reason I took that down, because I didn't want to drive that route.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000 You know, I didn't want to drive that route because you're getting blown up.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000 Because we were, we were having our soldiers get killed driving up there.
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000 And it's like, you know what?
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000 This makes no sense.
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000 Take it down.
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000 The cool thing is, is the shakes have been asked for me to take that down.
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.000 So when I took it down, I told the shakes the reason we took this down is because you wanted better access to the hospital.
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000 But out your surveillance, your Iraq, these civilians going through to check point.
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000 So they saw that as well.
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000 I listened to me. What was the outcome?
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:52.000 The outcome is in the elections in December where in January 2005, two percent of the citizens are
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000 Ramadi voted in an election.
01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:01.000 In December 2005, 80 percent of the Iraqis vote in the election.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000 The shakes were encouraging them to vote.
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000 And so we saw that as man we turned to a corner.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000 The other thing is we were trying to recruit Iraqi police.
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:21.000 Because we knew we had to get Iraqi police to agree to join and then to go through to training.
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:29.000 So we would have recruiting events and we were getting two or three Iraqis to show up at the recruiting event in joint.
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000 Until January.
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000 January 3rd, we had this recruiting event at the glass factory.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000 200 Iraqis standing in line to join.
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000 That's only because of the shake encouragement.
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000 January 4th, we had about 500 Iraqis standing in front of the glass factory to join.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000 Man, we were ecstatic.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000 And just to give a little bit more detail, just to reemphasize what you said.
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:12.000 These are 500 local citizens that are tribal tribesmen with tribal leaders are directing them.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000 Hey, looks like the coalition looks like the Americans.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000 They kind of were getting on board.
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000 Go down and join the police so we can get ready in search and send this city.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000 The biggest mistake I made was I did it a third day in a row.
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000 And on January 5th, I think you know what happened to it.
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000 Suicide bomber detonated his vest in the middle of a thousand Iraqis who were there that day.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000 I mean, we were ecstatic.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000 We had a thousand Iraqi showing up the join when months before we had two or three.
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000 I mean, this was a turning point.
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000 So this suicide bomber detonates their vest.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000 Kills at least 100 Iraqis citizens.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000 Kills, my best friend, Mike McLaughlin, who was my leader in engagement officer.
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000 And Kills, Sergeant Can, who was a Marine dog handler.
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000 And wounds several other soldiers, but not, not, you know, seriously.
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000 And, but any wound is serious if you get wounded, I guess.
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000 And totally disrupted the whole thing.
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.000 The thing I was proud of with that though is that Iraqis we already had inside the glass factory.
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000 We continued to process them.
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000 What I did the next day, and again, we were devastated by this.
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000 What I did the next day, I called all the leaders involved with that recruiting operation.
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000 Because that was a battalion plus operation, a pull this off.
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000 Got all the leaders in.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000 I said, listen, we're going to do an after action review of lessons learned thing on this.
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000 And I said, before anybody says anything, and I know, you know, your book extreme ownership talks about this.
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000 Not, not this exact incident, but in general.
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.000 I said, before anybody says anything, I said, I'm the guy responsible for that attack yesterday.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.000 I said, so this review, this after action review isn't going to have anything to do with putting blame on anybody.
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000 Because it's my fault, this is what happened.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:20.000 I said, what we're going to do is we got to figure out we got 200 Iraqis showing up next week to get on buses.
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000 So we could transport them to the police training.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000 I said, we got to figure out how do we make this safe a week from now.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000 Safeer a week from now.
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000 So the same thing doesn't happen again.
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.000 And so we took some specific tactical measures to make it much safer.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000 One of the things we did, we got these big Texas barricades.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000 And we formed up 10 different stalls.
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000 We're only 10 people at a time could fit inside of a stall.
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000 So if a suicide bomber did detonate their vest, the most they could kill is nine other people.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000 Instead of 100.
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000 You see what I'm saying?
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000 And then we set up some other measures.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000 I don't want to get into the detail on this podcast because it's not important.
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000 The point is, is that we made it safer the next week, even after the devastating attack,
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000 where 100 Iraqis were killed and some of my soldiers were killed,
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.000 we still had those 200 police, or 200 civilians showing up to go to police training that next week.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000 And then the thing that happened that was exactly what you said.
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000 When they saw that they couldn't stop these young people,
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000 these young men, these young Iraqis coming into continue to see the process through.
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000 That's when they started to murder the shakes.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:45.000 And that's what cut out our leader engagement completely because these shakes used to come to the government center once a week to talk to me.
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000 Zero showed up.
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000 Once they started getting murdered, they weren't showing up.
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:58.000 So the thing we were not able to do was protect those shakes.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:07.000 And that's what really caused a lot of the turmoil to occur up to the point where you guys got there.
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000 I've heard Mike McLaughlin.
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000 Mike McLaughlin?
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000 Mike McLaughlin.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000 Mike McLaughlin.
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000 Mike McLaughlin.
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000 I've heard him referred to as the shake of shakes.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000 He was one of these guys that kind of got it absolutely.
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000 And was making friends.
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000 And he was that kind of guy.
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000 He was he owned his own construction business.
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000 He was a field artillery officer.
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000 And since we had the triple-due from Utah National Guard as the GS artillery battalion,
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000 you know, I had this extra field artillery lieutenant colonel there.
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000 And so I made a my leader engagement officer.
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000 And he was just this type of guy being a business man.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000 And he was talking about using National Guard civilian skills.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000 You know, he's an entrepreneur.
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000 He was just able to connect with all these different Iraqis.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000 He used to say that Ramadi because of your fratis river.
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000 And the I think was the NASAR canal running into your fratis river.
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000 He said that reminded him of Pittsburgh, you know, with the rivers running together.
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000 So he told everybody, he told all these Iraqis that, you know,
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000 someday Ramadi is going to be like Pittsburgh.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000 And I'm going to come back and visit.
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000 You know, I'm going to bring my wife and kids back here.
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000 Yeah.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000 How long after the the glass factory bombing?
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000 So then the recruit starts showing up again.
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000 Yeah.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000 The insurgents realize, oh, we haven't broken their will yet.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000 We got to start killing the shakes.
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000 Was that a week later, two weeks later?
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000 I'd say it was within four.
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000 You know, I don't have this on the tip of my memory,
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000 but it was probably within about four weeks.
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:53.000 I think the intel that I remember was, I think it was seven or eight of the main shakes got murdered.
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000 Yes.
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000 And then the other shakes, most of them just fled.
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000 They went to ground.
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000 Yeah, they either fled or went to ground.
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.000 And the other reason why Ramadi was so dysfunctional is right when the war started.
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000 There were some like really heavy duty main shakes living in Ramadi.
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000 They all went to Jordan.
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000 So the shakes that were left in Ramadi were the sub shakes.
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000 So, but they were still the power brokers there.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000 But they just weren't as powerful as the shakes.
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000 So I actually left the the country, but even, you know, like I liked you said,
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000 you know, they got murdered and that really.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000 That really changed things because now the the shakes were not cooperating with us like they had.
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000 They just kind of went to ground and reneutralized.
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000 And really, that's the purpose.
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000 I mean, that's that's that's that's terror, right?
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:54.000 We are going to terrorize you to the point where you no longer will step up.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000 Right.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000 And that's exactly what happened.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.000 And that was the al Qaeda in Iraq segment who was doing that because, you know,
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000 as you as you know, you know, you mean there there there were different segments of the insurgency.
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000 One was the acuysie al Qaeda in Iraq.
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000 The other one was the local insurgence.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000 We had a different goal than al Qaeda in Iraq.
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000 The local insurgence just wanted to coalition forces to leave.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000 We could deal with them, you know, because we could let them know that, hey, you, you know,
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000 men things settled down here when you get enough of your own sons and Iraqi police.
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000 We will leave.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000 We'll be glad to leave.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000 That's a good deal.
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000 You want us to leave.
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000 We want to leave.
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:31.000 Exactly.
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000 Let's figure this out.
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000 And then you had the criminal element.
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000 And then you also, you know, the criminal element, they were just concerned what
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000 make and money by selling weapons.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.000 And then you also had this fourth contingent there who were former Iraqi generals.
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000 They knew where the ordinance was hidden.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000 You know, there were cashiers all over the place.
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000 They knew where they were hidden.
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000 They knew to the terrain.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000 And they wanted to regain their status and power again.
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000 That was there.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000 That was their goal.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000 You mentioned this very briefly, but, you know, you just mentioned being out.
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000 And I remember being out on an operation somewhere.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000 And there you are.
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000 You know, there's the brigade commander walking down street.
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000 And you, you just said you were going to mention a little bit about what that mentality
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000 was.
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000 I mean, I, pretty sure I know what it is because I did the same things.
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000 Like sometimes I was going on operations with my troops because I need to go on
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000 operations with the troops.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000 Was that a similar mindset that you had?
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000 Yeah.
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000 You could only learn so much from hearing reports.
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000 You got to get out there and see things with your own eyes.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000 That was one reason.
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000 The other reason is it did a lot from a rail.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000 You know, when the soldiers saw that, I need to commanders out there.
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000 They feel like somebody is sharing the load.
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000 And in order to build trust, that, you know, I talk a lot about building trust.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000 And one of the, the keys to building trust is to share the load.
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000 This, this show whoever is working for you that you're willing to do the same thing they're
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000 doing.
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000 And so those were the two reasons I felt it was very important to get out there.
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000 But, you know, I read this book.
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000 It was called the Clay Pit Pigeons of St. Low.
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000 Oh, yeah.
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000 It's covered in on this podcast right here.
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000 Great.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:16.000 Great.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:16.000 Great.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:16.000 Great.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000 Grave John's.
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000 Glover John's who was also a hero in the Korean War too.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000 Yeah.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000 By the way.
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000 But I read that book.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000 And one thing Leather John's talked about in that book is when he was going with his little
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000 command group from point A to point B. And he had his radio operator with them.
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.000 And he had his S3 with them and S2 or whoever he had with them in that command group
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000 from that battalion headquarters.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000 He decided one day to go from point A to point B without a reason to do that.
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000 And mortars came in and killed about three or four of the soldiers in that command group.
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000 And he wrote in the book,
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000 how to light bulb an off in his head that, hey, when I make a decision to go from point A to point B,
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000 it's just not my life.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000 I'm putting on a line.
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000 I'm putting a life of my command group on the line too.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000 The guys who are traveling with me.
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000 So because I read that, I said to myself,
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000 I am never going to go from point A to point B just to do a joy ride through
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000 a remedy.
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000 Whenever I take my PSD out with me,
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000 my personal security attachment,
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000 a bunch of E3s and E4s and E5s.
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000 If they were going to get killed because I was going from point A to point B,
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000 I wanted to be a reason for them to die.
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000 And if so I had to go somewhere with a purpose.
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000 And I was out a lot because I had a lot of reasons to be out there.
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000 But I would never ever go out just for a joy ride because that's not what.
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000 Because I was putting those soldiers at risk every time I went out.
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000 And I was like, how was it, you know, you show up and there was already a Marine
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000 Battalion already there.
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000 Yeah, one five who,
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000 excellent combat leader,
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000 Battalion commander who is now a three-star general still serving in the Marines.
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000 Matter of fact, all three Marine Battalions who served with me because they were on seven
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000 month rotation.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000 So the one five was there.
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000 They served me for two months.
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000 Then the three seven came in and served me for seven months and then the three
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000 eight came in.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000 All three of those Battalion commanders are general officers now.
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000 You know, the Marine Corps is a small corps.
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000 And if you're going to become an infantry battalion commander in the Marines,
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000 you've got to have your shit together.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000 They don't put anybody in charge of a Marine infantry battalion.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000 And all three of those commanders were excellent.
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000 Was there any time, you know,
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:44.000 the three people always talk about the competition between the Army, the Marine Corps.
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000 I'm not even going to say Navy because the Navy makes up such a small element, but you know, the Army
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000 Marine Corps.
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000 I always tell anyone and as a matter of fact, it's sort of a point for me.
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000 If anybody ever tries to, you know,
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000 get me to say something about the Army and the Marine Corps.
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000 I won't say, I won't say a negative comment,
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000 not even in a joking manner.
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000 I won't do it.
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000 Because of what I saw over there, what I saw from those soldiers, what I saw from those Marines.
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000 Did you feel the same thing?
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:17.000 Just nothing, but nothing, but nothing, but let's work together to get this done.
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000 Absolutely.
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000 And I feel the same way about you.
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000 I will not joke about another service.
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000 One thing I learned over there,
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:31.000 even from the Army, you know, a lot of times in our, if you're infantry, you know, you think all the other branches don't matter.
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000 And I kind of have that attitude before going over there to a degree.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000 And one thing I learned is every branch matter,
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000 matter significantly, every MOS of any soldier.
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000 I mean, it's all such an important team.
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000 And in term, you know, and answer your question with the Marines, man,
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000 I just learned to respect those Marines so much.
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000 They respected us, you know, I was a little bit concerned.
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000 Here I am a national guard brigade commander, and now I've got an act of duty,
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000 Marine Battalion, task organized in my brigade, and I have an act of duty army battalion.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000 When I first got there was 269 armor before first at a 506 got there.
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000 I'm second man, what are these act of duty,
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000 Battalion commander is going to think of a national guard brigade commander.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000 They showed me nothing but respect.
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000 And I think that's the way you got to do it.
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:27.000 You have to personally, I think, you know, if you're going to work with anybody in the military,
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000 you have to come from the perspective that these guys are professional.
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000 They know their business until they give you a reason to feel differently.
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000 You know, and I feel that way about trust, too.
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000 And a lot of people don't understand this at first, but, you know, in order to create trust in an organization,
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000 I think you have to trust your followers first before they will trust you.
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000 And the question I like to ask people is this.
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000 I say, have you ever worked for somebody that didn't trust you?
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:03.000 And people say, yeah, you know, there's been a case where I work for somebody who didn't trust me.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000 I said, were you able to trust that person?
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000 And the answer is always, no, how could you trust somebody who doesn't trust you?
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000 So if I'm a leader and I don't trust my subordinates, if I just come in with attitude,
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000 I'm not going to trust you until you prove you could, I could trust you.
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000 How they're going to trust me because you cannot trust somebody who doesn't trust you.
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000 So you have to trust others first.
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:34.000 But again, those, those baton commanders from all three Marine battalions, all two Army Battalions that act of duty units that worked with me,
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000 showed nothing but respect and trust of me and thank God.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000 I never did anything to do anything that caused them not to trust me.
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000 So I'm just, I'm just so thankful that I had such professionals to work with over there.
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000 And then of course, the Battalion Commander from the National Guard Unit set were with me.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.000 You know, I had National Guard Battalion from Vermont, who we never worked with before those tasks organized to me from Utah,
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:09.000 with the Fielder Teller Unit that was task organized to, to my brigade and everybody just came together.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.000 And again, I think, because it was so violent there, people just knew the, hey, we got to do our job, you know.
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:25.000 And it's funny, after coming back and continuing in the Army in a non-worthime environment,
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:34.000 it's funny how that attitude changes a little bit when you're in a peace time setting.
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:48.000 I've heard you tell a story about one of your, one of your Marines, EOD guys, and really just, I would love for you to be able to share that story.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000 And I think you know the one I'm talking about.
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000 Yeah, absolutely. This happened on September 19, 2005.
01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:09.000 And I actually, earlier that morning, we had one of our soldiers killed. He was a driver of a Bradley fighting vehicle. I do went up underneath the driver's compartment of his Bradley and he was killed.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:22.000 And later on that day, we had a patrol under the command of a lieutenant from the Vermont National Guard, who was conducting a patrol down to the to me area of Ramadi.
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:31.000 And you may recall there was a railroad bridge down there. And we had an outpost that that railroad bridge that didn't exist before we got there.
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:40.000 The brigade that was there before us just didn't have the, what it took to get down there and put that outpost in, but we put the outpost in.
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:50.000 And then we had to secure that area to keep the lines of communication operational, so we could rotate troops in and out, get a logist down there, get a QRF down there.
01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:02.000 Whenever we had to, a quick reaction force. And so anyway, we had this lieutenant from the Vermont National Guard patrolling that area and for up armored humvies.
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000 And he began to get an surgeon fire from, around by the railroad bed.
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:15.000 And so he ordered his platoon, which was for up armored humvies to start maneuvering toward that insurgent position.
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:27.000 So they could close with them and destroy them. And as he was maneuvering in his vehicle, a subsurface ID detonated that had probably been there, maybe about a year in the ground.
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000 I don't know, you know, some of these IDs have been planted there for months.
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:41.000 And I did detonates and instantly kills the lieutenant and the two soldiers who were in that up armored humvie with them.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:57.000 And some 3K IA instantly. And whenever we would have attacks like this, we would try to, whenever we could send our EOD team down to do a post blast analysis to determine the type of tactics, the type of ordinance,
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000 the type of procedures, the insurgents for using when they conducted these attacks.
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000 And we did that, just try to prevent these attacks from happening again in the future.
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:15.000 And so gun resgt. Michael Burkehart was the gun resgt, who led two other Marines down to that site.
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000 And it was chaotic down there, you know, but our guys were providing security.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000 They're going to get down there with the EOD, with just two fellow Marines.
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:31.000 And he sees that destroyed up armored humvie and near the up armored humvie, he sees this crater, a couple feet deep, about four feet in diameter.
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:47.000 He just made an assumption that that's where the IED had been placed. So he jumps down in the crater, take a closer look in as soon as he was in the crater. He realized he wasn't at a good place because he saw 252 millimeter artillery shells in the ground in front of him,
01:42:47.000 --> 01:43:01.000 what red detonation core running into the nose of those shells. So he took his K-bar knife, cut the red dead cord, believed he'd neutralized the IED. He didn't see a third artillery shell in the crater behind him.
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:14.000 The the vices, those insurgents, to use, there were Seneo base stations, which were high power cordless phones, they use them a lot in Africa, like in villages to get telephoned reception within their village.
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:26.000 So it's a very high powered cordless phone base and they would, they would strap that base to their artillery shell and then use a cordless phone about a kilometer away.
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:32.000 They usually had about a kilometer distance, they would hit the button on that that nation device to cause the IED to explode.
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:47.000 And in the surgeon was obviously out there in the distance watching hit the button on that detonation device, artillery shell blows up and back a gunny berkart, knocks him about 15 feet into the air, lands unconscious on the ground like a ragdoll.
01:43:47.000 --> 01:44:02.000 Our soldiers go immediately up to him, they believe the wounds were very, very severe, they call them a Medovac helicopter and they start tending to his wounds as pants were soaked with blood, they cut his pants off.
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:13.000 He's unconscious. After a couple of minutes, actually regains consciousness, he's laying there on his back and he asks the soldiers if he has his legs because he has no feeling from the waist down.
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000 He thought he had both legs blown off but the soldiers assured him he had his legs.
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:26.000 The reason he was concerned about his legs and he told me that this himself is his dad, served three tours in Vietnam.
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000 On his dad's third tour in Vietnam, his dad was shot in the back by a sniper.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:44.000 Gunny berkart had a girl up as a young boy with the pain of seeing his father confined to a wheelchair because his dad was paralyzed from the waist down.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:45:02.000 He was still alive and his dad was seeing him also confined to a wheelchair. That's where he was concerned about his legs. But anyway, they said, no, you got your legs a few minutes go by, they're tending to him. He gets a tingling sensation in his legs. He tells the soldiers he wants to try to stand up and the soldiers couldn't believe this.
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:14.000 He just got him blown up ten minutes earlier and we had an embed reporter from the Omaha World Harrow on the ground with him that day.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:22.000 Gunny berkart stands up and the Medivac chopper lands on the ground behind him and the soldiers go to a Gunny berkart that go Gunny.
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:45.000 The soldier is not going to have you carry me to that chopper on the stretcher. I'm going to walk there under my own power because I don't want the sergeants have the pleasure of seeing me being carried to the helicopter.
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:58.000 The reporter takes the picture at that exact second. There's a berkart finger in the air, the fire, a growing protector and front of his groin.
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:14.000 No pants on and the reporter takes this picture and later on that day the reporter comes in to see me because he had been on the ground with us for almost a month.
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:30.000 I know it's been a really bad day for you. I lost four soldiers that day. I want to show you this picture. I won't release it unless you give me permission. He lifts up his laptop screen and pulls up the picture.
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:46.000 I said, you got us, you got to get this in the paper. The rest of the leadership story, what Gunny berkart is this though. It's a cool war story.
01:46:46.000 --> 01:47:00.000 I have the soldiers die, but the leadership component of the story. As I told you he had two young Marines down there with them that day.
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:18.000 He was going to have to be recovering from those wounds. He wanted to walk there to the helicopter as to not shatter the confidence of those two young Marines that were out there with them.
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:44.000 The leadership element of the story is even after getting blown up. His main concern was in what his own wounds. His main concern was with the confidence of those two young Marines that he knew was going to be out there later on.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000 His concern was with those two young Marines who worked for him. And isn't that what leadership is all about?
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000 Wearing more about the guys who follow you than you worry about yourself. I just think it's an inspirational story.
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:12.000 We had very few politicians coming to visit us or quote VIPs coming to visit us in Ramadi, but whenever we did, if I had a brief from the first slide I showed him was Gunny berkart through on a finger of those injuries.
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:26.000 Some of the other things that are happening is you're spending a bunch of money trying to, you know, the provincial reconstruction and development.
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000 Tell us a little bit about that.
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:42.000 Yeah, we had a lot of money to dole out. And this was the issue. We had nobody from the state department there with us until I think the last month before we left because it was so violent.
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:57.000 So we didn't really have that state department support. And whenever we would, whenever we would give money to the Iraqis to fix the school or a water plant or whatever, then surgeons would destroy it.
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:13.000 Didn't really do that well with fixing infrastructure there in Ramadi. And as you could probably remember, there was Sue joining down the streets all the time because of the roadside bombs that were blowing up and breaking sewer pipes and everything else.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:28.000 So we did do our best to get into schools. We had patrols going into schools all the time passing out stuff that the kids was in schools. It was kind of weird environment there because some days, well not some days.
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:44.000 Every day you knew you were going to have a high probability of getting shot at or blown up. And yet we tried to create some normalcy, especially with the kids there. And so it was really weird in that way.
01:49:44.000 --> 01:50:02.000 You know, we're talking about extreme ownership a little bit earlier and you know, the, I opened it up talking about a blue on blue that we had you are there at the time. And I know there was a lot of different stuff going on. And it probably didn't even make the radar of what you had seen and what you were dealing with.
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:16.000 But and it was weird for me because you know, in the seal teams having a blue on blue is it seems like the most impossible thing that could ever occur.
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:38.000 And you know, how could it possibly happen that one of a good guy shoots a good guy. How is that possible? And so in my chain of command after that happened very early in deployment. For me to try and explain to people that this, this happens. This happens a lot in this environment.
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000 What was how often were you seeing those situations unfold.
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:50.000 First let me say in the army, just like in the seals, we take blue on blue very seriously is the matter fact even in training events.
01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:02.000 If there's a, if we're doing a war fighter exercise, which is a computer generator exercise, if there's a blue on blue event in the war fighter, it's got to be investigated. That's us here so we take it.
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:28.000 I saw blue on blue more often than I would have thought. And it was primarily units passing through another units area of operation where the, you know, the unit passing through wasn't clear on where certain combat outpost or observation posts were set up.
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:46.000 And they would see what look like, you know, again, a soldier would have weapon in the sand. And I know you talk about in, in your book with Chris Kyle actually where that happens. I remember an interesting situation I'll just mention to you.
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:58.000 I had a patrol down into meme, which is in southern Ramadi. And they were, you know, conducting their operations down there dealing with Iraqi citizens and talking to them and and such.
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:07.000 And then there was a civil affairs team that was not part of my brigade that was also in that vicinity.
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:21.000 And there was some small arms fire and the unit from my brigade that felt that there was an insurgents up on top of a rooftop. And this is very similar to a story you tell.
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:38.000 And the commander on the ground wanted a super cobra since some Marines were supporting us, not in a patchy but a super cobra fire on the rooftop at what he thought were insurgents up there. And I happened to be in the operation center at the time.
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:55.000 And I guess it's just over time to get some type of intuition, something just did not seem right. And the fire that this patrol was under wasn't really that significant where I felt it wasn't, you know, life threatening to that patrol.
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:11.000 And I said, you know, let's just let this play out a little bit more. Let's use some tactical patients here and let this play out a little bit more before I give an order for a super cobra to fire on that target as a turned out it was the civil affairs team on that roof.
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000 And I just thank God.
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:34.000 I just thank God that God gave me the presence of mine to to wait a little bit and just see how things develop before pulling to trigger on that thing. So it's it's just have to again use, you know, real big in the army, you know, especially when you're a lieutenant or something and hey, you got to make a decision.
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:47.000 And I mean, I talked about making decisions quickly. Sometimes the best decision to make is let me use some tactical patients. Let me just see how this plays out a little bit until I get a little bit more information before I pull the trigger on something.
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:58.000 Yeah, the other part of that is not not getting emotional because as you know, and I think we were talking about earlier, I think before we even started recording is a lot of times.
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:08.000 And see who is attacking you, right, and you're losing guys. Guys are getting wounded, guys are getting killed. And now all of a sudden someone's telling you we see the bad guys.
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:16.000 It's it's hard not to just have an emotional moment to say, hey, oh, there's bad guys there. Let's get them.
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:27.000 Yes. And you have to take a moment to make sure that the decision you're making is the right decision. And like you said, sometimes it's a pause and I've been talking about this a lot lately.
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:38.000 So one of the principles of leadership that I talk about all the time is default aggressive, which means you're going to make something happen. Make it happen. Like, like don't wait.
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:44.000 But there's if you pay attention to that term default aggressive, it's the default mode.
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.000 It's not it's not the mandatory mode. It can be overruled. It can be overridden.
01:54:50.000 --> 01:55:00.000 The the Marine Corps just came out with a new book called Learning and one of them for one of the terms that they use throughout the book is they try to train Marines to have a bias for action.
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:07.000 Same thing. It's not blind action. It's not take a media action no matter what. It's lean towards taking action.
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:18.000 That's the same thing with default aggressive. It's hey, your default mode is I'm going to be aggressive. That doesn't mean you are necessarily going to be aggressive.
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:31.000 Yeah. And you know, when you're engaged in fighting a counter in certainty, the other thing is you don't. You don't want to kill an insurgent at the expense of killing innocent civilians.
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:42.000 And that's something from reading history since I was a teenager, especially World War II history, you know, all of the civilians that were killed during World War II.
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:49.000 And I remember when I first got through a moddy, this is how I had learned as I was there, you know, we talk about continuous learning.
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.000 As I would say that it shakes, hey, this is a battle going on here.
01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:02.000 Civilians are going to die. You got to accept that. They didn't want to accept that. That was their tribesmen, you know, they didn't want to accept that.
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:11.000 Yeah, these civilians are going to die. And I learned through the course of time there that we had to do if we wanted to win this thing.
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:23.000 We had to do all we could do to not kill innocent Iraqi citizens. And if that meant not killing an insurgent in order to save three innocent citizens, you were better.
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000 You were better to I felt you were better to operate that way.
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.000 Yeah, I think that's the that's the standard that's the standard that's what that's that's the American.
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:38.000 Yeah way and that you know, that's another thing and we've talked about this a little bit and then this is.
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:51.000 I don't like to get wrapped up in, you know, people that are going to argue political points about, you know, the way things unfolded that the way things unfolded, right?
01:56:51.000 --> 01:57:05.000 But one of the things that you hear a lot is people will talk about, you know what I'm, when I say this, I'm really talking about there's people that just look at the Iraq war as this complete horrible thing everything was wrong.
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:24.000 And one of the things that they say all the time is that all these civilians died and and something that I try and point out to people all the time is yes, you're right civilians died and yes Americans did kill some of those civilians.
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:42.000 But we went through extreme measures and took extreme risks always to prevent any civilian casualties and the amount of civilians that Americans actually killed is not a big number.
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:54.000 The reason that the number of civilians killed is so large is because of the insurgents and because of the fighting that took place in the, you know, she versus SUNY for instance.
01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:05.000 It really, the amount of civilians killed by Americans is a very small number when you compare it to what the insurgents did to the people of Iraq.
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:22.000 No, absolutely agree. I mean, it is our values and the thing I'm most proud of them, Reigns and soldiers I worked with over there in the seals I worked with over there is that here in two are military values and to our American values of of doing just that.
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:34.000 Taking great pains not to kill a civilian even at the risk of not killing a bad guy so very, very proud of a quick story I want to share with you.
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:47.000 The governor that we talked about dealt with him a lot. He had to have a medical procedure conducted at one point in time so since Ramadi was so dysfunctional in chaotic we had to send him the bag dead to an American military treatment facility in Baghdad.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:59:03.000 He's been talking about two weeks for this medical procedure. He comes back and sends a message that he wants to see me so I go see him and he asked everybody in the office to leave, you know, you usually have this on tries of shakes in there and his staff.
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:15.000 He left except him me and my interpreter. He sits down beside me first time he takes my hand in his and for anybody knows anything about air culture when an Arab man takes another man's hand in his.
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:33.000 He said, you know, Colonel Granski, many times you have sat here, you've talked to me about American values and values of the Marines and soldiers. I never knew what you were trying to tell me.
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:46.000 My own eyes, how a wounded and surgeon was brought into the trauma center there. And I saw how your American medic's and nurses and doctors struggled to save the life for this in surgeon.
01:59:46.000 --> 02:00:09.000 I could not believe how hard you Americans worked to save the life of one of your enemies. So now I finally realize what you were trying to tell me about American values. And I mean that really hit home that he saw what his own eyes, how we treated our enemies fighting the save of the life of this in surgeon.
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:24.000 From a leadership perspective and really from a personal perspective as well. I mean, I know there was months where you lost, lost to very significant casualties.
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:39.000 And when I look at the glass factory and what it just insane set back. And even here when you talk about it earlier when we weren't recording, you know, just the, the.
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:58.000 You know that that for you seeing the local populace showing up. I mean, this is the, this is the dream for a, for a counter insurgency is that we're going to get the local populace. They're going to take to the streets and clean up the insurgents and this is how we win and all of a sudden. And a matter of days.
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:13.000 A pathway to victory is actually visible. And then to have that horrible incident take place losing, you know, you're, you're best friend over there.
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:29.000 And yet you still have to press on what what is it about how do you do that mentally. How do you get up. How do you move forward when you take these significant setbacks.
02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:48.000 You know, Jack, I think the answer is pretty simple. It's because especially when you're in a leadership position, you've got others counting on you. So because you've got others counting on you, you have no choice, but to continue to even in situations like that to try to be as positive as you could.
02:01:48.000 --> 02:02:02.000 You know, one thing I did over there because you know, the days over there could seem like Groundhog Day to the average soldier out there on a patrol day after day, you know, seeing, you know, these Iraqis give them the stink eye and all that.
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:18.000 And having his buddy killed and wounded and all of that Groundhog Day, I actually put out what I called success cards on a monthly basis because the average soldier didn't understand the success we were having and had to be communicated to the average soldier marine.
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:34.000 So what would be on the success card? Okay, we found this many weapons cashiers this month. We detained this many high value target in surgeons this month. We actually did engagements in this many schools this month, etc, etc.
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:50.000 So there was always something to be able to communicate that you succeeded on that if you were just the average soldier out there doing your job day after day, you might not have seen that, but I think people have to understand when they're in a situation like that.
02:02:50.000 --> 02:03:06.000 Leaders have to have a way to communicate the bigger picture to their followers, so they understand you are making progress because otherwise, you could seem like you're not, but, and that's your question. I think it's just about the fact that people are counting on you, you got to do your job.
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:35.000 As you guys are nearing the end of deployment, I show up there task unit bruiser. One of the first things that we start planning for is like a philusia style clearance of Ramadi and the plan as I understood it and again, it seems like a long time ago in some ways, and this is one of those ways, trying to remember exactly, but the plan that as I remember is we were starting to organize this thing was that
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:43.000 all when the one one AD showed up and we have the two two eight and the one one AD on the ground at the same time, we got double the combat power.
02:03:43.000 --> 02:04:03.000 We're going to do a massive push through and I was telling my guys from a political standpoint, it made sense to me because this is why I told my guys I said look, I think this is going to happen and the reason I think it's going to happen is because Maliki, who just is the prime minister and he's a shea and this is a city filled with Sunni people.
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:32.000 And I bet he's going to say, yep, go for it. I happen to be wrong and Maliki was a lot smarter and was a lot a lot more willing to try and work towards a stable Iraq because he realized that no actually we're not going to do that. There's too much death, there's too much destruction. It will look exactly like what it is, which is a big shea army push into a city filled with Sunni's and a bunch of Sunni's getting displaced and it'll be bad.
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:51.000 I actually on one of my podcasts was discussing this with one of my friends Darrell and he had read some information that that was all the the plan for a big push through was actually kind of a faint to try and get insurgents to leave.
02:04:51.000 --> 02:05:06.000 And I don't know if it's true or not, I don't know if you know it's true or not. What do you remember about that? I remember there was talk about it. But the other crazy thing there was talk about not having a brigade come in to do a relief with us.
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:23.000 I was curious about what this area is talking about when two to eight leaves there's not going to be another brigade there. So there was so it went from one extreme to the other. I did hear talk about a major push and I you know through the city to quote clean it out.
02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:51.000 I think that there may not be another brigade to come in actually the brigade that ended up coming in there wasn't really identified until shortly before we left. So I think it was a lot of leaders from both sides I rack and and United States trying to figure out what the best course was and it was a very complex situation, very chaotic.
02:05:51.000 --> 02:06:20.000 And I think that we're just trying to really figure it out. I was in in between my first appointment to Iraq and my second appointment to Iraq. I was the admels aid. So I work for the admels in charge of all the seals great guy and that put me in a lot of meetings a lot of meetings that a O three would never be in some of those meetings in the Pentagon in with with the highest you know the highest leaders in the military.
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:40.000 And I saw that I saw that there was people inside the military that were wondering if we could win and wondering how we could win if we could win. You know the the report that came out in that that summer no six.
02:06:40.000 --> 02:07:01.000 And I said we can't win. It's unwindable an unwindable situation. So the idea that that both those options were on the board actually kind of makes sense because you had I guarantee you had some people saying what we can't win we can't win in that area.
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:15.000 And obviously some people saying hey we can we just need to get the combat power that's needed and we need to commit to it. Yeah. So you know there's an old saying you can't kill yourself out of an insurgency.
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:30.000 Yeah, you can't kill enough in surgeons. There's always going to be more insurgency and even my mindset change while I was there initially when we went in our mission statement was to defeat the the insurgency take away their will to fight.
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:49.000 And it actually evolved into protecting the populace and there's a big difference between hey let's see how many insurgency kill versus hey let's protect the population and to protect the population you need a certain amount of mass of troops there.
02:07:49.000 --> 02:08:03.000 And I do think what happened when the follow-in brigade came in they did they were able to mass more troops which is great and I give all the soldiers and Marines credit for for the great work they did with with two to with
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:18.000 Second brigade twenty eight I.D. and then with with the ready first I mean the credit belongs to the average soldier Marine that was out there slugging it out every day to average seal that was out there doing their job every day and not giving up.
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:38.000 Yeah, I mean they just I mean there's a perfect example of resiliency even with those odds stacked against us. Our soldiers and Marines just would not give up. Yeah, we my my task unit what was good about my task unit I think what was really appreciated.
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:55.000 And it was we could kill those bad guys and we could kill those bad guys and it was you know you could see you know you talk to a company commander and anyone of those company commanders that were out there they'd go out they'd get in patrol they'd get in a gunfight.
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:10.000 They'd shoot at some people they wouldn't really know we would leave dead bodies in the streets of the insurgents and it was of the insurgents and that just seemed to be a really good asset and something that made the
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:31.000 conventional guys man they were they were so happy when we'd show up at one of their one of their combat outposts they would be so happy for us to show up there because they knew that they'd send out a patrol and they'd get in a gunfight for sure and sometimes they'd kill a bad guy but they knew that we would we would rack up these kills and what's
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:46.000 what's good about it is it allowed us to eliminate the bad guys wall protecting the populist so it was a great tool in this environment to help out and that was
02:09:46.000 --> 02:10:03.000 that's one of the main things that people talk to me about is you know how do you build relationship right and how do you build relationships with people and for me it's real simple you build a relationship by saying how can I help you and that's why when I walked into your office
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:16.76 and you've got you know what six thousand I guess you include I rack his ten thousand troops there and I'm not thinking about me and what can I do I'm thinking what how can I help you and that's the attitude enough to say
02:10:16.76 --> 02:10:35.76 and that's the attitude we took with the one one eighty when they showed up it wasn't hey we're here it was what can we do to help you how can we what do you need from us how can we be a assistance and and then the relationship is oh we can definitely use your help and then guess what they give back to us help so it's pretty
02:10:35.76 --> 02:10:45.76 you know jockel a lot of things go through my mind as you're talking and again you had that great attitude of how could I how could I help I remember when
02:10:45.76 --> 02:10:56.76 two six nine armor left they were with me for the first six months we were there and then first to five oh six comes in so what's the difference between two six nine arm or in first to five oh six you're talking about an arm or
02:10:56.76 --> 02:11:08.76 a Italian versus a white infantry battalion okay so you know just because two six nine was rotating out doesn't mean they didn't need tanks there so this is a great story about
02:11:08.76 --> 02:11:18.76 uh resilience I guess you could call it with with this national guard platoon that I had working with two six nine armor it was a it was a
02:11:18.76 --> 02:11:31.76 uh platoon from an armor unit in the twenty eight I.D. uh platoon of soldiers so that was I think we had about forty soldiers there and they were tankers though but when they get to two six nine armor in
02:11:31.76 --> 02:11:43.76 these dramatic to work with them that I task organized them to actually I task organized an entire company there armor company and but but two six nine armor
02:11:43.76 --> 02:11:51.76 didn't need them to be armor soldiers they said hey you guys be motorized infantry because we got enough armor soldiers so that's what they were
02:11:51.76 --> 02:12:02.76 until two six nine armor leaves and then the first that a five first that five was six comes in and they said we still need tanks so we took a platoon from this armor company
02:12:02.76 --> 02:12:14.76 put them on tanks because they were trained tankers and they just talk about pivoting okay we're talking about pivoting with COVID-19 these guys pivoted from being tankers to being
02:12:14.76 --> 02:12:23.76 motorized infantry while two six nine armor's there and then first at a five or six infantry comes in they pivot back to being tankers get on tanks and did just a
02:12:23.76 --> 02:12:35.76 fabulous job and they had several main gun engagements in downtown Ramadi while they were working with first at a five or six and the first at five or six love them.
02:12:35.76 --> 02:12:44.76 I forget when month it was but I know there was a I.E.D. that the destroyed a tank in the Malab area which you talk about you know we're a soccer stadium was
02:12:44.76 --> 02:13:13.76 a tank commander was able to get all of his crewmen out of that tank without anybody getting wounded were worse and there's a fight that went on down there for at least 24 hours and a few soldiers were killed during that engagement from from the first at a five or six and but it just goes to show how these soldiers are so adaptable so agile able to pivot like that without complaining.
02:13:13.76 --> 02:13:30.76 It's kind of like this what you need us to do we'll do it. Isn't that amazing story though how many how many soldiers from other armies could make that type of pivot and do it in an outstanding manner like those soldiers that.
02:13:30.76 --> 02:13:55.76 I think that's the power of the American military to have that kind of attitude you know because. It's interesting as you say that hey how many people could pivot. And you're just talking about the pivot. You're not even talking about the fact that these guys are doing combat operation after combat operation after combat operation in the Malab district with subsurface ID's.
02:13:55.76 --> 02:14:05.76 Destroying humvies. You know these these coordinated attacks that they're doing the vehicle born IED's. I mean you were talking about the.
02:14:05.76 --> 02:14:13.76 The checkpoint on the railroad. Yeah right right in between to me and and south central Ramadi.
02:14:13.76 --> 02:14:25.76 That is one of that is that is a checkpoint that got overrun. Yeah got overrun by the enemy massive Iraqi soldiers killed and wounded.
02:14:25.76 --> 02:14:33.76 Most of the Iraqi soldiers deserted after that never came back but that's the kind of the enemy there was really good.
02:14:33.76 --> 02:14:45.76 Yeah and they use the same they they use combined arms you know between RPGs and mortars and machine gun and then vehicle born IED's. They coordinated over the radio they had met a back procedures.
02:14:45.76 --> 02:14:48.76 I mean they did what.
02:14:48.76 --> 02:14:55.76 What military units did. Yeah what it was a military unit and they had a goal of creating a caliphate.
02:14:55.76 --> 02:15:05.76 Yeah I mean that was their goal you know talk about purpose you know talk about inspiring people by giving them a purpose that that was their purpose and life was to create.
02:15:05.76 --> 02:15:13.76 Was to take over Ramadi so they could have that as part of what they thought would be in a mercenalific.
02:15:13.76 --> 02:15:21.76 So it's really interesting that's full spectrum between a follugious style clearance and a hay would leaving and not coming back.
02:15:21.76 --> 02:15:29.76 Yeah that that shows you where the war was I mean it really does.
02:15:29.76 --> 02:15:36.76 Now we we start getting towards the end of year deployment and we're starting turnover procedures and at some point obviously.
02:15:36.76 --> 02:15:40.76 We went from hey we're going to do a massive kinetic sweep.
02:15:40.76 --> 02:15:48.76 To all right we're going to continue this counter insurgency we're going to start doing this in the less kinetic way then a follugious style.
02:15:48.76 --> 02:15:56.76 And it starts to become time for you guys to kind of kind of pack up head home.
02:15:56.76 --> 02:16:05.76 You went when you guys as a unit head back how long does that redeployment take.
02:16:05.76 --> 02:16:09.76 Well the.
02:16:09.76 --> 02:16:19.76 And we're going to take place about two weeks so you know we call it left seat right seat so for the first week that the brigade that's going to take our place gets there.
02:16:19.76 --> 02:16:23.76 We're still in the left seat or to drive receipt and they're observing.
02:16:23.76 --> 02:16:29.76 And then for the second week there in a driver seat there in the left seat and then we're in the right seat observing them.
02:16:29.76 --> 02:16:35.76 So in theory it's it's about two weeks and that's about what it was maybe it was 10 days instead of 14.
02:16:35.76 --> 02:16:50.76 So when we get back we went back down to quite for a few days and then got back over to the states here I think was four ticks where we actually demobed that and that was I think about five or six days so.
02:16:50.76 --> 02:17:04.76 There wasn't a lot of there really wasn't that much time to decompress before sending these national guard soldiers which I commend it obviously like we already talked about it some active duty forces with me to but for the national guard units that were with me.
02:17:04.76 --> 02:17:14.76 To go back into their civilian environments it wasn't a lot of decompression time when you get right down to from leaving an environment like a Romadi I mean.
02:17:14.76 --> 02:17:25.76 Dangerous chaotic environment like that to go back and doing whatever their civilian job was but that's the other thing about the guard that I just want I don't know if we emphasize it enough is.
02:17:25.76 --> 02:17:36.76 The unique thing with the national guard they have their military training so they could do their military skill but then they also bring civilian skills with them I'll give you an example.
02:17:36.76 --> 02:17:48.76 I had some officers who worked in the police departments here in the states and we had them working with Iraqi police to try to help them become better police you know we had.
02:17:48.76 --> 02:17:58.76 We had everything that we had bankers we had carpenters we had electricians and a lot of that led to creating better.
02:17:58.76 --> 02:18:12.76 A better infrastructure at our combat outpost and in other places so our soldiers could live a little bit more of a better life when they when they weren't out on patrol so a lot of these civilian skills that the guard have actually.
02:18:12.76 --> 02:18:19.76 We pay dividends when you go into a combat situation a lot of people don't think about that.
02:18:19.76 --> 02:18:30.76 It's crazy for me to think now we we've kind of changed our perspective now on how you decompress people and even like in the seal teams when we came home from Romadi we got on a plane we flew home and we were home.
02:18:30.76 --> 02:18:44.76 We were going to be quite frank what we did was they sent us we went to a bar and we drank and we and they had they had guys to shuttle us home with our one new guy would drive our car and the other new guy would drive.
02:18:44.76 --> 02:19:05.76 Sorry one new guy would drive us in our car to our house another new guy would follow him and take him back to do the next run for the next guy.
02:19:05.76 --> 02:19:14.76 And then we went to tell stories you want to get it out of your system you want to laugh you want to cry you want to you want to kind of like you said decompress.
02:19:14.76 --> 02:19:23.76 For the soldiers coming home and then they're rolling back into a civilian job and all of a sudden they're not seeing their their friends every day the people that they just served with.
02:19:23.76 --> 02:19:33.76 What did it look like from your position as the commander as all that unfolded what were the reports coming back where guys getting in trouble was it useful and one thing that I tell.
02:19:33.76 --> 02:19:43.76 Military guys all time active duty guys when they get out whether they just get out of whether the retire like you got to find a new mission right so I imagine some people.
02:19:43.76 --> 02:19:52.76 And they say it's time to go back to work okay go back to work they kind of get back into that mission but for me I we see guys that have the most trouble when they don't have.
02:19:52.76 --> 02:19:59.76 They don't have a job to go into they don't have anything to do now they kind of the devils what is it the idle hands are the devil's play thing.
02:19:59.76 --> 02:20:24.76 And I think again I had 35 states contribute soldiers to second brigade 28th ID and so you know the main states were Vermont Pennsylvania and Utah so for those states I think things were a little bit easier because at least you still had soldier from your state from your unit even though you might be miles apart but still relatively close in hand.
02:20:24.76 --> 02:20:38.76 And for the other soldiers that we might have got you know 40 soldiers from Illinois or you know another 130 soldiers from Michigan I mean a lot harder because.
02:20:38.76 --> 02:20:54.76 And they don't know what those soldiers really went through I mean they read about if they saw it on the news but they weren't there and you probably know jaco that it's pretty hard to talk to somebody who hasn't been there about what we've been through I could have much easier time talking you about this than I could.
02:20:54.76 --> 02:21:09.76 And I think that's the reason for somebody who's who's never been there and and even if I'm just talking to and acquaintance somewhere.
02:21:09.76 --> 02:21:34.76 And it is very difficult for national guard soldiers because they aren't as they're not staying in the same military post or base that a seal is or that an active duty soldier or marine might be so that that is a difficult part and we just try to keep an eye on each other and that's what we've tried to do when we when we came back home I will tell you.
02:21:34.76 --> 02:21:50.76 There were some suicides and there were some other issues that even the the state soldiers are still still trying to deal with and it's it's a never ending fight when you come back from a place like that.
02:21:50.76 --> 02:22:07.76 But what was your situation when you got home did you stay on active duty for a while did you go back to work. Yeah I did stay on at that point in time I wasn't with the family business anymore at this point in time I was already off working with a consulting firm in the Philadelphia region.
02:22:07.76 --> 02:22:27.76 So yeah I stayed on an active duty for for a few months and then I went back to work one thing I did have the opportunity to do we did have 15 of our Pennsylvania National Guards and get killed in action over there and I had an opportunity to I just made it a point to go see the families and.
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:45.76 I just have to say how much respect I have for the families and as you know whenever one of our brothers or brothers get killed and thank out although I had 200 female soldiers with me in the brigade none of the females were killed over there.
02:22:45.76 --> 02:22:59.76 I always feel bad for the family you know yeah I feel bad if I lose a friend obviously feel terrible about it. But the thing that hits me most emotionally is when I think about the family.
02:22:59.76 --> 02:23:13.76 It's going through with that mother and father are going through with the brothers sisters are going through with the wife or you know going through the spouse is going through and that's what gets me most emotional when I think about that.
02:23:13.76 --> 02:23:33.76 I wanted to go and visit those families and they're remarkable. I thought there might be some that would be very very. Angry and every one of them respected the sacrifice that they're that they're loved one had made so that just really heart and me about.
02:23:33.76 --> 02:23:47.76 And so I think that's the fact that it what even though it was the soldier that made the decision to join the family still supported that decision and supported the sacrifice that they made and that really heart and me in a way.
02:23:47.76 --> 02:23:51.76 I do want to talk about so I don't know if you know this or not but.
02:23:51.76 --> 02:24:13.76 I created a warm memorial to the the fallen that I do know that I've seen it it's pretty it's pretty special was around the sembra of 2005 I was talking to my sergeant major and we decided that at that point at time I can't remember exactly what the number of KIA was in December but it was at least.
02:24:13.76 --> 02:24:31.76 40 I know that much and we just decided that we should create some type of memorial to these soldiers and Marines and by the way at the end of the day by time we had left there there were three navy corps and that had been killed in action there too.
02:24:31.76 --> 02:24:43.76 But at any rate. We put out the word in the brigade that we wanted to have a memorial to these soldiers and.
02:24:43.76 --> 02:24:58.76 One of our Pennsylvania National Guards became forward to what it designed it was a female she was an art teacher and her civilian job and she put out this concept I remember when she described it to myself in the sergeant major I think in early January.
02:24:58.76 --> 02:25:11.76 I actually brought tears to my eyes it was an oblisk and a pair of dog tags for every soldier that was killed but hang inside of this oblisk and it would have cuts through it.
02:25:11.76 --> 02:25:25.76 The cuts look like it was shrapnel cuts and and and a machine gun fired into it too and as the wind would blow through this oblisk as the dog tags would clink together in the wind.
02:25:25.76 --> 02:25:31.76 The boulism was to fall in warriors as they continue to speak to us. So think about that.
02:25:31.76 --> 02:25:39.76 And so we we we had our soldiers in the maintenance units built this memorial in Ramadi.
02:25:39.76 --> 02:25:54.76 We dedicated it on Easter Sunday April 16 2006 we dedicated it we had I think it was a at that time about 72 of our soldiers had been killed in the end of the Marines and others had been killed in action at that time.
02:25:54.76 --> 02:26:11.76 And we had the deputy commander from the Marine Division there for this ceremony we had and all the battalion commanders were there and it was just a special tribute and we took a risk because you don't want that many people.
02:26:11.76 --> 02:26:26.76 You know congregated in one spot at any area and there and we did have our share of rockets and mortars falling on the for operating base and we have this memorial ceremony in April and then when we left there in June.
02:26:26.76 --> 02:26:42.76 We deconstructed it put it in a connect ship the back home and then in October 2016 we re dedicated it in a 40 need town gap it still stands there this day I think it's one of the only warm memorials.
02:26:42.76 --> 02:26:59.76 That first memorial had is the mother's home is Sam with one stone piece of ground inside from the prison through Hamburg, total housing for them and including the children as a grown son and then he constructed and red dedicated back here in the United States I don't know if there's another memorial like that.
02:26:59.76 --> 02:27:08.48 He was a sergeant, a filler, kill, res sergeant, who had serious burns and from months
02:27:08.48 --> 02:27:13.20 was in treatment at Brook Army Medical Center and succumbed to his wounds that had received
02:27:13.20 --> 02:27:14.84 the November of 2005.
02:27:14.84 --> 02:27:21.12 He succumbed to those wounds in July 2006 and he was the last set of dog tags that we
02:27:21.12 --> 02:27:23.92 hang inside of that memorial.
02:27:23.92 --> 02:27:32.20 And again, it took me years before I could explain to you what I just did without crying.
02:27:32.20 --> 02:27:37.52 And just that symbolism of the—and I—of is there a memorial day.
02:27:37.52 --> 02:27:40.60 The symbolism is the wind blows through that obless.
02:27:40.60 --> 02:27:45.60 Those dog tags clink together, those fallen warriors continuing to speak to us.
02:27:45.60 --> 02:27:47.88 I think is just so powerful.
02:27:47.88 --> 02:27:54.40 And that's why I think events where we do something in honor of a fallen warrior are so
02:27:54.40 --> 02:28:00.48 important because I believe whenever we speak a fallen warriors name or do something
02:28:00.48 --> 02:28:05.000 in their honor, we keep their spirit on earth alive.
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000 I think there's something powerful of that.
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.44 Keeping their spirit on earth alive.
02:28:08.44 --> 02:28:09.44 Think about that.
02:28:09.44 --> 02:28:14.32 I'm sorry to deviate here for a minute, but we do this march for the fallen that I think
02:28:14.32 --> 02:28:19.32 you're aware of.
02:28:19.32 --> 02:28:23.20 It's a 28-mile rock march we do at Fort Indian Town Gap.
02:28:23.20 --> 02:28:23.80 Very similar to the Baton Memorial Death March we usually get about 1,000 people there every
02:28:23.80 --> 02:28:24.80 year.
02:28:24.80 --> 02:28:28.88 And everyone does that rock march in honor of a fallen warrior.
02:28:28.88 --> 02:28:35.28 And when you're out there doing a 28-mile rock march for the 35-pound pack, your feet
02:28:35.28 --> 02:28:40.08 are bleeding a little bit, your sweating, your tear up now and then when you're thinking about
02:28:40.08 --> 02:28:41.96 what you're doing.
02:28:41.96 --> 02:28:45.56 That better dedication to keep the spirit of a fallen warrior alive.
02:28:45.56 --> 02:28:46.80 It's just amazing.
02:28:46.80 --> 02:28:48.84 I just think it's an important thing to do.
02:28:48.84 --> 02:28:53.000 Memorial Day is an important holiday remembering our fallen is so important.
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.76 We could never forget the sacrifice they made and we could never forget the families that
02:28:57.76 --> 02:29:04.20 are still suffering to this day that lost loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan.
02:29:04.20 --> 02:29:06.80 And that memorial march is up.
02:29:06.80 --> 02:29:07.80 It's open to the public.
02:29:07.80 --> 02:29:08.80 Yeah, it's open to the public.
02:29:08.80 --> 02:29:13.92 September 26 this year, so far it has an app and canceled because of the COVID or anything.
02:29:13.92 --> 02:29:20.52 If people at Google march for the fallen to 2020, it'll come up by just Google that today
02:29:20.52 --> 02:29:26.24 to make sure what would come up and it came up by Google March for the fall in 2020, it was
02:29:26.24 --> 02:29:27.24 the first thing to come up.
02:29:27.24 --> 02:29:32.64 You'll see it's at 14 in town Gap, Pennsylvania, 28-mile rock march in honor of those
02:29:32.64 --> 02:29:34.72 fallen warriors.
02:29:34.72 --> 02:29:39.36 And just a great tribute to keep the spirit of these fallen warriors alive.
02:29:39.36 --> 02:29:41.16 No doubt about it.
02:29:41.16 --> 02:29:46.08 And I remember seeing that on the list when I got there, you guys fell in the ground.
02:29:46.08 --> 02:29:49.44 I think I got there right around the time it was dedicated.
02:29:49.44 --> 02:29:51.08 I forget the exact date.
02:29:51.08 --> 02:29:55.64 I'm going to actually try and figure that out because I should know that date.
02:29:55.64 --> 02:30:00.52 But you were telling me earlier and then I agreed.
02:30:00.52 --> 02:30:03.24 You asked me if I kept the journal in the Ramadi as it known.
02:30:03.24 --> 02:30:07.76 He said you had neither in both of us wish that we had because you know you just a little
02:30:07.76 --> 02:30:12.20 dates like that of that they mean a lot.
02:30:12.20 --> 02:30:19.000 But I remember seeing that and of course it's very sobering for when I showed up there
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.72 and look we knew what we were getting into.
02:30:22.72 --> 02:30:29.68 So to see that monument, to see those dark tags and know what each one of those represents
02:30:29.68 --> 02:30:35.12 was definitely a very sober and very solemn moment.
02:30:35.12 --> 02:30:39.84 And you're absolutely correct.
02:30:39.84 --> 02:30:47.28 Every time you talk about the people that you know, the people that you lost, their spirits
02:30:47.28 --> 02:30:48.28 still here.
02:30:48.28 --> 02:30:51.76 That's one of the best things about the job that I do.
02:30:51.76 --> 02:30:55.80 I go around and talk to companies and even right here right now, this is what we're doing.
02:30:55.80 --> 02:30:56.80 We got friends.
02:30:56.80 --> 02:31:01.56 We got people that sacrificed so that we can sit here today.
02:31:01.56 --> 02:31:03.88 And we can never forget that.
02:31:03.88 --> 02:31:06.80 We can never forget their families.
02:31:06.80 --> 02:31:13.16 And you know, a children's fire are warriors to continue to adhere to our values and continue
02:31:13.16 --> 02:31:19.04 to drive on whatever mission it is because of all these soldiers from everywhere that made
02:31:19.04 --> 02:31:23.28 the ultimate sacrifice to build a country that we have.
02:31:23.28 --> 02:31:27.56 And I know, you know, obviously a lot of social unrest and there's a lot of things that
02:31:27.56 --> 02:31:32.68 may not be perfect about our country, but I get guaranteed this after being over and
02:31:32.68 --> 02:31:36.44 I rack after spending the last three years in Europe and traveling to about 40 different
02:31:36.44 --> 02:31:38.60 countries over there.
02:31:38.60 --> 02:31:44.04 There is no country that is as great as our country in many, many different ways.
02:31:44.04 --> 02:31:50.32 So it's an imperfect country, but it's a country that people from all over the world want
02:31:50.32 --> 02:31:53.04 to gravitate to and come here.
02:31:53.04 --> 02:31:56.28 We just got to all work together to keep this country great.
02:31:56.28 --> 02:31:58.08 That's what that was about.
02:31:58.08 --> 02:32:06.76 We all work together to gain the promise that our forefathers, one of this country to be.
02:32:06.76 --> 02:32:13.20 And they probably, you know, hey, when they wrote that constitution, they knew it wasn't
02:32:13.20 --> 02:32:18.28 a perfect constitution for a lot of reasons, primarily because of slavery.
02:32:18.28 --> 02:32:24.68 And we have to just keep working at things to make this country what it needs to be.
02:32:24.68 --> 02:32:27.96 And we all need to work together to achieve that.
02:32:27.96 --> 02:32:32.40 You ended up going to 40 different countries when I was over in Europe in the last three
02:32:32.40 --> 02:32:33.40 years.
02:32:33.40 --> 02:32:35.68 Yeah, yeah, and many of the many times over.
02:32:35.68 --> 02:32:37.84 So was that did you, so you picked up?
02:32:37.84 --> 02:32:39.28 So you got home from Remadi.
02:32:39.28 --> 02:32:40.88 What was your next, what happened then?
02:32:40.88 --> 02:32:48.24 Yeah, when I got home from Remadi, I did get promoted to become a one star.
02:32:48.24 --> 02:32:51.56 I worked at our joint force headquarters at an Italian town gap.
02:32:51.56 --> 02:32:56.24 And then in 2011, I was asked by our agent, General LeCommon full time.
02:32:56.24 --> 02:33:02.64 So I served full time for year as one of the deputy agent in general at our joint force headquarters.
02:33:02.64 --> 02:33:07.48 And then I was given the honor of commanding to 28th Infantry Division for over three years.
02:33:07.48 --> 02:33:15.32 So I did that full time from 2012 until 2016.
02:33:15.32 --> 02:33:21.48 And then in 2016, I had the honor of getting assignment to go to US Army Europe and
02:33:21.48 --> 02:33:25.92 Viesbot in Germany for three years as one of the deputy commanding generals there.
02:33:25.92 --> 02:33:31.96 And I served over there again for three years, worked with our NATO allies and other
02:33:31.96 --> 02:33:34.76 European partners.
02:33:34.76 --> 02:33:39.32 And I have the greatest respect for our allies over there.
02:33:39.32 --> 02:33:44.88 Was in Ukraine many times to the training center that we have there.
02:33:44.88 --> 02:33:51.24 Was a Ukrainian battalion rotates out of the Dombaes region where they're still fighting
02:33:51.24 --> 02:33:53.64 the Russian-led separatists there.
02:33:53.64 --> 02:33:59.04 And by the way, when I left there, about 30 Ukrainian soldiers were getting killed every
02:33:59.04 --> 02:34:00.04 month.
02:34:00.04 --> 02:34:04.16 So I mean, it's still a war going on in the Dombaes region.
02:34:04.16 --> 02:34:08.04 But battalions would rotate out of the Dombaes, the Ukrainian battalions.
02:34:08.04 --> 02:34:13.20 They'd come back to Western Ukraine to a training area that we had there.
02:34:13.20 --> 02:34:20.76 United States, Canada, Lithuania, and Poland would work together to help this battalion
02:34:20.76 --> 02:34:24.24 train to be a more effective fighting unit.
02:34:24.24 --> 02:34:26.52 And so was there many times.
02:34:26.52 --> 02:34:31.92 But yes, spent a lot of time in Poland and the three Baltic countries down in the Balkans.
02:34:31.92 --> 02:34:34.12 I mean, I was all over the place.
02:34:34.12 --> 02:34:36.32 Did you speak any Polish?
02:34:36.32 --> 02:34:37.84 Very, very little.
02:34:37.84 --> 02:34:41.24 Yeah, very, I could say good night and hello and those type of thing.
02:34:41.24 --> 02:34:46.76 The funny thing is, my grandmother and father, my grandmother died when I was 10.
02:34:46.76 --> 02:34:50.48 So I remember my grandmother and father speaking Polish together.
02:34:50.48 --> 02:34:54.96 And the reason they didn't want to teach any of us kids Polish is so they could talk
02:34:54.96 --> 02:34:58.000 and Polish, but I would also know what they were trying to say.
02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.88 So they didn't try to teach us the language.
02:35:00.88 --> 02:35:05.16 One of my friends, it was in the sealed teams with me.
02:35:05.16 --> 02:35:09.68 He was, his dad was a Mexican.
02:35:09.68 --> 02:35:18.56 And the kid looked Mexican and I said, he had a little bit of an accent.
02:35:18.56 --> 02:35:22.92 You know, a little bit of an accent just from growing up with his dad who spoke Spanish.
02:35:22.92 --> 02:35:30.32 And who, to this guy's admission, he said, you know, my dad didn't really speak English
02:35:30.32 --> 02:35:32.08 very well at all.
02:35:32.08 --> 02:35:34.44 And his mom spoke Spanish too.
02:35:34.44 --> 02:35:37.24 And I said, oh, that's why you have a little bit of an accent.
02:35:37.24 --> 02:35:39.64 He said, yeah, you know, that's probably where it comes from.
02:35:39.64 --> 02:35:43.32 And I said, well, you know, at least you speak Spanish.
02:35:43.32 --> 02:35:45.76 And he goes, no, I don't speak Spanish.
02:35:45.76 --> 02:35:52.52 His dad refused to have him speak Spanish because his dad wanted him to be an American.
02:35:52.52 --> 02:35:57.16 And even though his dad wasn't, you know, great with English, he wouldn't speak to him
02:35:57.16 --> 02:35:58.16 in Spanish.
02:35:58.16 --> 02:36:01.60 And I thought that's where you're going to go, you know, because that was kind of the old
02:36:01.60 --> 02:36:04.64 attitude was, hey, we're in America now.
02:36:04.64 --> 02:36:07.32 So interesting story.
02:36:07.32 --> 02:36:13.40 You know, I did, you know, have this little thing that you, you put together when, when
02:36:13.40 --> 02:36:15.32 you were the commanding general there at the two to eight.
02:36:15.32 --> 02:36:16.32 There was a couple little things.
02:36:16.32 --> 02:36:17.32 I just wanted to highlight.
02:36:17.32 --> 02:36:18.32 I just made it the 28th.
02:36:18.32 --> 02:36:19.32 I did not the two to eight.
02:36:19.32 --> 02:36:20.32 Oh, sorry.
02:36:20.32 --> 02:36:21.32 Yes, the 28th idea.
02:36:21.32 --> 02:36:22.32 Yeah.
02:36:22.32 --> 02:36:26.28 When you were the division commander, you had a sort of a guidance for your troops.
02:36:26.28 --> 02:36:29.000 And there's just a couple good leadership things in here.
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:34.32 It says every leader is trusted and expected to use disciplined initiative within the commanders
02:36:34.32 --> 02:36:38.76 and tent without wasting time requesting permission.
02:36:38.76 --> 02:36:45.24 Report up as the situation develops, request further guidance or support as necessary, demonstrating
02:36:45.24 --> 02:36:52.08 a high level of initiative is worth the risk of making honest mistakes.
02:36:52.08 --> 02:36:55.32 So great, concise statement there.
02:36:55.32 --> 02:36:59.92 Yeah, I think that came from my time in Ramadi where I realized, you know, as we were
02:36:59.92 --> 02:37:04.20 in distributed operations there, I mean, most operations were conducted at the Platoon
02:37:04.20 --> 02:37:06.16 level there.
02:37:06.16 --> 02:37:12.76 And, you know, the situation was so dynamic that you couldn't waste time asking your higher
02:37:12.76 --> 02:37:14.56 level leader, you know, what should I do?
02:37:14.56 --> 02:37:16.24 You know, you had to show an issue of it.
02:37:16.24 --> 02:37:20.56 So when I came back, I knew our soldiers were going to continue to deploy overseas.
02:37:20.56 --> 02:37:24.80 As a matter of fact, we have elements of our aviation brigade in Pennsylvania, getting ready
02:37:24.80 --> 02:37:27.24 to go over to Afghanistan.
02:37:27.24 --> 02:37:29.88 And I just knew, this was going to be a long war.
02:37:29.88 --> 02:37:32.80 We were going to continue to deploy troops over there.
02:37:32.80 --> 02:37:37.000 And I realized one of my jobs as the Vision Commander, even if we didn't deploy the
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:43.20 entire division over there, I had units going over, had to get them ready to fight in chaotic
02:37:43.20 --> 02:37:49.84 situations in the best way to do that was to help them understand the need to develop initiative.
02:37:49.84 --> 02:37:54.60 And we had to do that in a training environment so that when they got to a combat environment,
02:37:54.60 --> 02:37:56.16 they would continue to do that.
02:37:56.16 --> 02:37:57.16 This is the thing.
02:37:57.16 --> 02:38:02.76 If in a training environment, you don't allow your soldiers or in a civilian organization
02:38:02.76 --> 02:38:09.000 to allow your people, say, in a steady state operation, to demonstrate initiative, then when
02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:13.20 you get as a soldier to deploy overseas, if you're not used to this, this is playing
02:38:13.20 --> 02:38:15.68 initiative in a training environment, guess why?
02:38:15.68 --> 02:38:17.96 It doesn't automatically flip a switch in its combat.
02:38:17.96 --> 02:38:20.68 Now I'm going to show some initiative.
02:38:20.68 --> 02:38:24.16 That doesn't happen the same in a civilian company.
02:38:24.16 --> 02:38:28.80 If you don't allow your employees to demonstrate initiative, steady state, then when you
02:38:28.80 --> 02:38:35.04 hit something like the coronavirus COVID-19, they're not automatically going to display
02:38:35.04 --> 02:38:36.04 initiative.
02:38:36.04 --> 02:38:40.16 So I think it's important to encourage that before you're in a crisis.
02:38:40.16 --> 02:38:42.08 No doubt about that.
02:38:42.08 --> 02:38:44.52 That was always my main goal.
02:38:44.52 --> 02:38:50.28 That's the fourth law of combat that I talk about is decentralized command.
02:38:50.28 --> 02:38:56.32 And it's the most powerful of the laws of combat that I talk about.
02:38:56.32 --> 02:39:00.28 Not the other ones are powerful, but you can't have decentralized command unless you have
02:39:00.28 --> 02:39:03.68 cover move, unless you have, unless you keep things simple, unless you prioritize next
02:39:03.68 --> 02:39:04.68 to you.
02:39:04.68 --> 02:39:06.04 Those things don't really work.
02:39:06.04 --> 02:39:10.12 Decentralized command cannot work without those three, but once you implement decentralized
02:39:10.12 --> 02:39:14.08 command, this is what allows a team to really do well.
02:39:14.08 --> 02:39:15.68 Yes, everybody leads.
02:39:15.68 --> 02:39:17.24 That's what you want.
02:39:17.24 --> 02:39:19.24 So what was your last tour in the Army?
02:39:19.24 --> 02:39:24.16 My last tour in the Army was as one of the deputy commanding generals at US Army Europe.
02:39:24.16 --> 02:39:27.04 I served there from 2016 to 2019.
02:39:27.04 --> 02:39:34.64 I left Europe in April 2019 and then retired in Pennsylvania in June 2019.
02:39:34.64 --> 02:39:36.04 Two months after I left Europe.
02:39:36.04 --> 02:39:39.40 And then what point did you start writing the book?
02:39:39.40 --> 02:39:43.48 You know, the funny thing with the book is again, I did this bicycle trip, but my wife
02:39:43.48 --> 02:39:46.56 in 15 months old son in 1983.
02:39:46.56 --> 02:39:52.52 So here it was 2019, just retired from the Army, sitting around a fire pit with my younger
02:39:52.52 --> 02:39:57.08 son Timothy, and he starts asking me questions about this bike trip.
02:39:57.08 --> 02:40:01.28 Because I believe in an I didn't talk about it all that much for some reason.
02:40:01.28 --> 02:40:05.36 And I start telling him stories and we're laughing and he goes, Daddy goes, you should
02:40:05.36 --> 02:40:07.08 write a book about it.
02:40:07.08 --> 02:40:10.52 And so I get back home, I'm talking to my wife and she goes, you know John, I think
02:40:10.52 --> 02:40:16.36 that's a good idea because your kids and your grandkids need to know the story.
02:40:16.36 --> 02:40:18.28 And I do have two grandchildren.
02:40:18.28 --> 02:40:19.76 And I said, you know what?
02:40:19.76 --> 02:40:22.92 If nothing else, just for the family, you know, to have the story.
02:40:22.92 --> 02:40:28.44 So I took this journal that I kept on the bike trip that was sitting in a shoe box, literally
02:40:28.44 --> 02:40:34.64 a shoe box for over 35 years, used that as a basis to write the book.
02:40:34.64 --> 02:40:41.32 And then because I'm as passionate about leadership as you are, Jockel, I wanted to put
02:40:41.32 --> 02:40:45.36 a leadership component in there because there were so many leadership elements to that
02:40:45.36 --> 02:40:46.92 bike trip.
02:40:46.92 --> 02:40:53.22 And so I wrote the book, I started in the fall of 2019 and then was able to get a
02:40:53.22 --> 02:40:57.08 published in February of 2020.
02:40:57.08 --> 02:40:58.08 Quick turnaround.
02:40:58.08 --> 02:41:04.24 You know, like I said, there's a ton of stuff, great stuff inside this book.
02:41:04.24 --> 02:41:09.48 I want to read one more chunk of it, pretty good chunk here.
02:41:09.48 --> 02:41:11.44 And the part, this is a part called leadership.
02:41:11.44 --> 02:41:14.64 And look, you've got these leadership lessons kind of strewn throughout.
02:41:14.64 --> 02:41:20.52 When you put an exclamation point on them here, you say this character, competence, and
02:41:20.52 --> 02:41:24.16 resilience are essential, essential for effective leadership.
02:41:24.16 --> 02:41:28.08 Leaders must be true to their values even when their backs are against the wall.
02:41:28.08 --> 02:41:33.12 Leaders must cultivate trust by trusting others first, sharing the load, and following
02:41:33.12 --> 02:41:35.24 through on promises.
02:41:35.24 --> 02:41:40.60 Leaders must care more about those they lead than they care about themselves.
02:41:40.60 --> 02:41:46.44 They must clearly communicate a vision or action, an action plan that is realistic and
02:41:46.44 --> 02:41:51.44 believable, be problem solvers and have the courage to make decisions.
02:41:51.44 --> 02:41:56.56 Leaders must help others develop and become stronger and leaders must be fit in many ways,
02:41:56.56 --> 02:42:01.40 including physical, spiritually, mental, and emotional fitness.
02:42:01.40 --> 02:42:04.56 Leaders must have the resilience to overcome adversity.
02:42:04.56 --> 02:42:10.56 Resiliency is not only about toughness, but it's also about exuding positive energy that
02:42:10.56 --> 02:42:13.08 inspires others.
02:42:13.08 --> 02:42:15.72 Having a positive attitude is essential.
02:42:15.72 --> 02:42:17.92 We choose how we feel.
02:42:17.92 --> 02:42:23.80 We can choose to be happy or sad, angry or calm, upbeat or down.
02:42:23.80 --> 02:42:30.52 Organizations and teams take on the attitude and personality of their leaders.
02:42:30.52 --> 02:42:35.84 The attitudes of those on the team reflect the leaders attitude.
02:42:35.84 --> 02:42:44.40 If your team has a bad attitude, look in the mirror.
02:42:44.40 --> 02:42:53.80 Those are an example of just powerful leadership lessons that you have inside this book.
02:42:53.80 --> 02:42:56.08 Tone of other ones in there.
02:42:56.08 --> 02:43:00.08 I know we've been going for almost three hours right now.
02:43:00.08 --> 02:43:05.80 As I told you earlier, I consider you're a perspective on this stuff all day long.
02:43:05.80 --> 02:43:12.48 I'm not going to keep you as a prisoner here.
02:43:12.48 --> 02:43:16.60 General Gronsky, let's talk about where people can find you, what you're doing right now.
02:43:16.60 --> 02:43:19.48 I know you've got your consulting company.

02:43:57.16 --> 02:43:58.16 You're getting on the gram.
02:43:58.16 --> 02:44:01.52 It's echo, it's like the call it.

02:44:10.52 --> 02:44:12.48 I do leadership consulting.
02:44:12.48 --> 02:44:16.52 I have many different clients throughout the country.
02:44:16.52 --> 02:44:18.92 I love to do what I'm passionate about.
02:44:18.92 --> 02:44:19.92 Awesome.
02:44:19.92 --> 02:44:20.92 Echo.
02:44:20.92 --> 02:44:23.56 Yeah, something to do with you.
02:44:23.56 --> 02:44:27.68 So just so I know you said you listen to the podcast and I'm sure you know that Echo
02:44:27.68 --> 02:44:30.92 has been sitting here for three hours.
02:44:30.92 --> 02:44:35.08 Something caught his mind two hours and 32 minutes ago.
02:44:35.08 --> 02:44:36.48 He's been having this question.
02:44:36.48 --> 02:44:37.48 Bruin.
02:44:37.48 --> 02:44:38.48 You know what?
02:44:38.48 --> 02:44:42.48 But, but, Jaco, I don't want to be like the only person in the United States who
02:44:42.48 --> 02:44:43.48 doesn't listen to your podcast.
02:44:43.48 --> 02:44:46.48 Yes, I listen to your podcast.
02:44:46.48 --> 02:44:49.44 This is actually going to be super simple and easy.
02:44:49.44 --> 02:44:53.64 I think you mentioned something real quick and brief.
02:44:53.64 --> 02:44:55.60 The left seat, right seat.
02:44:55.60 --> 02:44:57.92 What is that in when you transition?
02:44:57.92 --> 02:44:58.92 Yeah.
02:44:58.92 --> 02:45:04.16 And when one brigade is getting right to leave and another brigade is coming in to take
02:45:04.16 --> 02:45:06.28 over that mission.
02:45:06.28 --> 02:45:11.40 The brigade that's getting ready to leave for the first, let's say for the first week,
02:45:11.40 --> 02:45:14.52 is in the left seat, which means they're still in a driver seat.
02:45:14.52 --> 02:45:16.36 They're still doing the mission.
02:45:16.36 --> 02:45:22.64 And the incoming brigade is observing in the right seat in the passenger seat.
02:45:22.64 --> 02:45:27.84 And then the following week, the brigade that is now newly taken to mission will be
02:45:27.84 --> 02:45:32.40 in the left seat or the driver seat in the brigade that's about to leave is in the right
02:45:32.40 --> 02:45:33.40 seat observing.
02:45:33.40 --> 02:45:39.76 And then once that is done, the brigade that was there is gone home in a beyond a
02:45:39.76 --> 02:45:46.20 swithia, Eko usually most units want that to be done as quickly as possible to be quite
02:45:46.20 --> 02:45:47.20 honest about it.
02:45:47.20 --> 02:45:48.20 Yeah.
02:45:48.20 --> 02:45:52.08 Maybe like feel like they're holding their hand or something like that.
02:45:52.08 --> 02:45:53.40 Like, oh, we got this already.
02:45:53.40 --> 02:45:57.16 I thought of it in terms of like, you know, how like with your kids, right?
02:45:57.16 --> 02:46:01.08 You want to you want to train them to do their own stuff, right?
02:46:01.08 --> 02:46:05.44 And just simplify it like that and having that to kind of like consider like the whole
02:46:05.44 --> 02:46:07.24 situation or whatever.
02:46:07.24 --> 02:46:08.96 I feel like that was kind of useful.
02:46:08.96 --> 02:46:09.96 Because I figured that's what it meant.
02:46:09.96 --> 02:46:12.24 You know, let's see driver seat passenger seat.
02:46:12.24 --> 02:46:15.32 After a certain amount of time when the passenger seat is like, yeah, I think I can drive.
02:46:15.32 --> 02:46:17.36 Well, that is kind of a way to train somebody.
02:46:17.36 --> 02:46:20.20 You know, first you do it and let them observe.
02:46:20.20 --> 02:46:22.20 No, first you tell them how to do it.
02:46:22.20 --> 02:46:24.64 Then you do it and have them observe.
02:46:24.64 --> 02:46:27.24 And then you have them do it and you observe.
02:46:27.24 --> 02:46:28.24 Yeah.
02:46:28.24 --> 02:46:29.92 And after all, you just kind of leave.
02:46:29.92 --> 02:46:30.92 Yeah.
02:46:30.92 --> 02:46:31.92 They got it.
02:46:31.92 --> 02:46:32.92 Yeah.
02:46:32.92 --> 02:46:33.92 So it works.
02:46:33.92 --> 02:46:37.56 My recommendation is you stay humble when you're getting the turnover from somebody.
02:46:37.56 --> 02:46:38.56 Yeah.
02:46:38.56 --> 02:46:41.32 And listen to what they say, you know, they know things you don't know.
02:46:41.32 --> 02:46:44.64 And it's actually crazy to me to think about trying to transfer knowledge.
02:46:44.64 --> 02:46:50.48 When the guys came into relief, relief, task in a bruiser inside Ramadi, I was trying
02:46:50.48 --> 02:46:53.76 to tell them, you know, we're all everyone in the chain of commands.
02:46:53.76 --> 02:46:58.76 Just trying to give them all this information because you know how hard it is.
02:46:58.76 --> 02:47:04.72 And you're just just trying to give them there's no possible way you can transfer them all
02:47:04.72 --> 02:47:06.88 the knowledge that you have and you're doing your best.
02:47:06.88 --> 02:47:11.76 So when you come into those situations as a leader, open up your mind, open up your brain,
02:47:11.76 --> 02:47:13.92 try and absorb what people are telling you.
02:47:13.92 --> 02:47:16.08 They look, they, you might have a different vision.
02:47:16.08 --> 02:47:17.36 It doesn't matter.
02:47:17.36 --> 02:47:22.72 Listen to what they say, have an open mind.
02:47:22.72 --> 02:47:26.16 You're getting any other, any final thoughts?
02:47:26.16 --> 02:47:30.16 You know, just one final thought, we, you know, we talked about the experience over there.
02:47:30.16 --> 02:47:36.28 And the final thought, I guess, is how important families are to everything we do.
02:47:36.28 --> 02:47:39.72 We can't do what we do without the support of our families.
02:47:39.72 --> 02:47:45.28 And I remember a senior leader telling me a number of years ago, you know, one of the
02:47:45.28 --> 02:47:48.24 army values is loyalty.
02:47:48.24 --> 02:47:52.80 And he said, when we talk about the army value of loyalty, it not only means loyalty to
02:47:52.80 --> 02:47:57.04 your unit, it also means being loyal to your family.
02:47:57.04 --> 02:48:01.28 And that really stuck with me because you don't, I, I didn't hear too many senior leaders
02:48:01.28 --> 02:48:04.000 talking about that up to that point.
02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.68 And so whenever I talk to soldiers after that, I always remind me, you got to be loyal
02:48:07.68 --> 02:48:10.12 to your family as well as to your unit.
02:48:10.12 --> 02:48:12.28 And that's, and I think that's very important.
02:48:12.28 --> 02:48:18.20 So I, I guess the final point is, we just got to be so thankful for the support.
02:48:18.20 --> 02:48:23.24 We have from our families, you know, whatever that family unit might look like because we
02:48:23.24 --> 02:48:27.52 can't do what we do without the support of others.
02:48:27.52 --> 02:48:28.84 I'm ended that.
02:48:28.84 --> 02:48:33.28 And once again, thank you so much for coming here today.
02:48:33.28 --> 02:48:38.96 Thank you for teaching all these great lessons about leadership and life.
02:48:38.96 --> 02:48:45.16 And of course, and obviously thank you for everything you did for America for 40 years
02:48:45.16 --> 02:48:52.92 of service and specifically thank you for what you did for the soldiers, sailors,
02:48:52.92 --> 02:48:57.88 airmen, and Marines that served with you in the Battle of Mody.
02:48:57.88 --> 02:49:02.28 You and your troops set conditions for victory.
02:49:02.28 --> 02:49:08.12 And the men of the two two eight will always be revered by the seals of Task Unit
02:49:08.12 --> 02:49:17.04 Bruser for guiding us in the combat and standing by our side on the battlefield.
02:49:17.04 --> 02:49:27.36 And we will never forget the sacrifice of those fallen heroes, those iron soldiers who gave
02:49:27.36 --> 02:49:31.72 their lives for us.
02:49:31.72 --> 02:49:33.88 Thank you for everything.
02:49:33.88 --> 02:49:34.88 Thank you, Jack.
02:49:34.88 --> 02:49:37.76 Julia and honor to be here with you.
02:49:37.76 --> 02:49:42.56 Love the message that you get out there and echo gets out there alongside you.
02:49:42.56 --> 02:49:43.56 Thanks.
02:49:43.56 --> 02:49:47.20 Thanks for those important leadership messages you got.
02:49:47.20 --> 02:49:48.20 You get out.
02:49:48.20 --> 02:49:53.56 I have to tell you, I did read extreme ownership and I loved every page of it.
02:49:53.56 --> 02:49:58.72 It's an excellent book and something that anyone who's interested in becoming a better
02:49:58.72 --> 02:50:00.36 leader could learn from.
02:50:00.36 --> 02:50:01.36 Thank you.
02:50:01.36 --> 02:50:03.60 Appreciate it.
02:50:03.60 --> 02:50:09.48 With that general, John Gronsky has left the building.
02:50:09.48 --> 02:50:10.48 Yes.
02:50:10.48 --> 02:50:11.88 Awesome, too.
02:50:11.88 --> 02:50:19.04 See you again and awesome to talk to him and awesome to get those lessons learned.
02:50:19.04 --> 02:50:21.48 Now they must be applied.
02:50:21.48 --> 02:50:28.24 Echo Charles, any lessons that you think we could apply, any things we could do to make
02:50:28.24 --> 02:50:29.24 ourselves better.
02:50:29.24 --> 02:50:30.24 Yes.
02:50:30.24 --> 02:50:32.24 Left seat, right?
02:50:32.24 --> 02:50:33.24 See.
02:50:33.24 --> 02:50:34.24 That's a very much so.
02:50:34.24 --> 02:50:35.72 Here's the thing it made sent.
02:50:35.72 --> 02:50:38.24 I wasn't confused as to what it was.
02:50:38.24 --> 02:50:42.44 Once you realize, all you're talking about the driver seat and the passenger seat, that's
02:50:42.44 --> 02:50:45.16 what you're talking about.
02:50:45.16 --> 02:50:49.54 How like when you're trying to train somebody up, which actually you talk about long
02:50:49.54 --> 02:50:53.84 to from a long time ago, I'm like, okay, cool, cool.
02:50:53.84 --> 02:50:57.32 When you're trying to do that, it's like, what's the best, I've got to be a good trainer
02:50:57.32 --> 02:50:59.68 and all this stuff that I worry about.
02:50:59.68 --> 02:51:05.92 I'm talking to my kids, I'm talking to my like various things.
02:51:05.92 --> 02:51:11.04 But that's a good, just simplistic way of keeping your mind wrapped around it.
02:51:11.04 --> 02:51:14.20 And actually in a way, meth a method, all just do it.
02:51:14.20 --> 02:51:15.20 You just watch.
02:51:15.20 --> 02:51:18.24 If you have questions, ask, all you're going to walk myself through it while I'm doing
02:51:18.24 --> 02:51:23.92 it, teach my daughter how to make rice or I did like a year ago, whatever.
02:51:23.92 --> 02:51:26.68 And yeah, I'm just walking through it and I actually did that.
02:51:26.68 --> 02:51:28.60 The whole front seat, I'm not fancy.
02:51:28.60 --> 02:51:30.60 I'm like, uh, left seat, right seat.
02:51:30.60 --> 02:51:31.60 You know, did it?
02:51:31.60 --> 02:51:34.84 It said boom, this is how many cups of water, boom, this is how many cups of rice.
02:51:34.84 --> 02:51:36.48 You do it and she's just listening.
02:51:36.48 --> 02:51:37.64 So you do it, so I do it.
02:51:37.64 --> 02:51:40.12 It's walker through it, but I do it.
02:51:40.12 --> 02:51:41.12 Do it again.
02:51:41.12 --> 02:51:42.12 Do it again.
02:51:42.12 --> 02:51:44.92 You know, the same day I'm just saying day after day.
02:51:44.92 --> 02:51:48.52 And then after while you're like, okay, let's switch seats.
02:51:48.52 --> 02:51:50.80 But I'm in the front time in the passenger seat, right?
02:51:50.80 --> 02:51:53.84 Still offering, you know, tips or whatever.
02:51:53.84 --> 02:51:54.84 Worked.
02:51:54.84 --> 02:51:56.16 We're good too.
02:51:56.16 --> 02:51:57.84 Tips on making rice.
02:51:57.84 --> 02:51:58.72 Well, that's a mess.
02:51:58.72 --> 02:51:59.72 We're a mess, sir.
02:51:59.72 --> 02:52:00.72 Without a rice maker.
02:52:00.72 --> 02:52:04.56 Anyway, everybody has a rice and we just put the rice in the water, you press the button.
02:52:04.56 --> 02:52:05.56 It's good.
02:52:05.56 --> 02:52:06.80 You press the what?
02:52:06.80 --> 02:52:08.06 You press the button.
02:52:08.06 --> 02:52:09.84 Easy money.
02:52:09.84 --> 02:52:11.66 Either way.
02:52:11.66 --> 02:52:12.66 Rice.
02:52:12.66 --> 02:52:13.86 No rice.
02:52:13.86 --> 02:52:14.86 Whatever.
02:52:14.86 --> 02:52:16.24 This is what we're gonna do.
02:52:16.24 --> 02:52:17.22 supplementation.
02:52:17.22 --> 02:52:18.98 Let me go deep on this right now.
02:52:18.98 --> 02:52:19.98 Okay.
02:52:19.98 --> 02:52:22.72 So I was up on the the Joe Rogan podcast.
02:52:22.72 --> 02:52:23.72 Yes.
02:52:23.72 --> 02:52:25.76 I got to COVID-19 test.
02:52:25.76 --> 02:52:26.76 Yes.
02:52:26.76 --> 02:52:27.76 there.
02:52:27.76 --> 02:52:33.76 When I got the test, the doctor came, a doctor came to give me the test.
02:52:33.76 --> 02:52:34.76 He came to test.
02:52:34.76 --> 02:52:35.76 He prick my finger.
02:52:35.76 --> 02:52:36.76 We had to wait 15 minutes.
02:52:36.76 --> 02:52:38.76 And to body test though, to be specific.
02:52:38.76 --> 02:52:41.76 Yes, to find out if I've had this.
02:52:41.76 --> 02:52:46.36 If I developed this, he knew, you know, I was telling him, hey, look, I went to Seattle
02:52:46.36 --> 02:52:47.36 and went to New York.
02:52:47.36 --> 02:52:48.96 I went to San Francisco.
02:52:48.96 --> 02:52:50.36 I went to LA.
02:52:50.36 --> 02:52:52.76 I mean, I was in the hot zones.
02:52:52.76 --> 02:52:56.36 I was at Ground Zero for COVID at the end of January.
02:52:56.36 --> 02:52:59.36 On planes everywhere.
02:52:59.36 --> 02:53:02.16 He and kept traveling.
02:53:02.16 --> 02:53:07.96 I stopped traveling March 14th, I think.
02:53:07.96 --> 02:53:12.56 I was traveling in airplanes all over the place.
02:53:12.56 --> 02:53:16.56 I did not have the antibodies.
02:53:16.56 --> 02:53:20.60 And what he said was, with the amount of travel and done in the amount of exposure
02:53:20.60 --> 02:53:22.36 I've been exposed to it.
02:53:22.36 --> 02:53:27.96 He said sometimes people's immune systems are strong to the point where it doesn't even
02:53:27.96 --> 02:53:29.28 register.
02:53:29.28 --> 02:53:33.40 This little COVID-19 rolls in and it just gets crushed.
02:53:33.40 --> 02:53:37.08 So immune system, two things.
02:53:37.08 --> 02:53:44.000 Look, vitamin D3, which I take, joccal fuel, D3, I take it.
02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:45.000 I take it every day.
02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:48.16 As a matter of fact, I take more than recommended dose for whatever reason I take one
02:53:48.16 --> 02:53:50.36 of the morning, I take one of the night.
02:53:50.36 --> 02:53:55.76 I take cold war, which is all those immune supplementations.
02:53:55.76 --> 02:53:57.36 And for some reason, look, I'm healthy.
02:53:57.36 --> 02:53:59.20 Yes, I eat good.
02:53:59.20 --> 02:54:01.24 Yes, why not just kick it up.
02:54:01.24 --> 02:54:02.96 So who knows?
02:54:02.96 --> 02:54:03.96 Who knows?
02:54:03.96 --> 02:54:07.20 I'm just saying maybe not a coincidence.
02:54:07.20 --> 02:54:12.12 Like you heard what a rendez-doctor around a potchip said, right, on Joe's podcast, talking
02:54:12.12 --> 02:54:17.36 about vitamin D. And how helpful it is, how it helps with that.
02:54:17.36 --> 02:54:21.000 I take that religiously.
02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:24.24 I take the cold war religiously.
02:54:24.24 --> 02:54:26.60 And also, I'm in all these horrible places.
02:54:26.60 --> 02:54:28.96 And I'm just COVID-free, no factor.
02:54:28.96 --> 02:54:36.52 I'm just saying, hey, look, can I make a claim that these supplements will stop
02:54:36.52 --> 02:54:37.52 COVID-19?
02:54:37.52 --> 02:54:42.36 No, I can't make that claim, but I can tell you a little story.
02:54:42.36 --> 02:54:45.24 So anyways, look, those are the facts.
02:54:45.24 --> 02:54:48.16 Like a lot of exposure, no COVID-19.
02:54:48.16 --> 02:54:51.76 No, and oh, by the way, we're doing jujitsu at the office.
02:54:51.76 --> 02:54:53.08 I mean, it's crazy.
02:54:53.08 --> 02:54:56.76 What I expose my immune system to, no factor.
02:54:56.76 --> 02:54:57.76 What?
02:54:57.76 --> 02:54:58.76 COVID-1?
02:54:58.76 --> 02:54:59.76 Yeah, no.
02:54:59.76 --> 02:55:00.76 Try those out.
02:55:00.76 --> 02:55:06.56 That is crazy because even when you think about your, it's not like you're, let's say,
02:55:06.56 --> 02:55:11.60 a singer, or whatever you're putting on concert singing into the microphone, sign a few
02:55:11.60 --> 02:55:13.24 autographs, even a bunch of autographs.
02:55:13.24 --> 02:55:16.08 I just, I'm shaking a thousand people's heads.
02:55:16.08 --> 02:55:18.28 I'm hugging a bunch of people.
02:55:18.28 --> 02:55:19.28 It's crazy.
02:55:19.28 --> 02:55:20.28 Oh, yeah.
02:55:20.28 --> 02:55:21.28 Yeah, shaking everyone's heads.
02:55:21.28 --> 02:55:22.28 So you can everything.
02:55:22.28 --> 02:55:23.88 Everyone's having conversations with them.
02:55:23.88 --> 02:55:27.48 Basically, same conversations with them, like telling me a secret about something.
02:55:27.48 --> 02:55:29.16 They're in my face.
02:55:29.16 --> 02:55:33.68 When they started the whole social distancing, that became an actual, like, where
02:55:33.68 --> 02:55:37.12 it or whatever, the number one thing, handshakes.
02:55:37.12 --> 02:55:38.12 Number one thing.
02:55:38.12 --> 02:55:39.12 Oh, yeah.
02:55:39.12 --> 02:55:42.56 And you're doing that to everybody, different lines of people.
02:55:42.56 --> 02:55:44.12 That from all over the country.
02:55:44.12 --> 02:55:48.28 By the way, when I went to those cities, there was, you know, whatever percentage of the
02:55:48.28 --> 02:55:50.20 audience they didn't, they weren't from DC.
02:55:50.20 --> 02:55:51.20 They weren't from New York.
02:55:51.20 --> 02:55:53.28 They drove there from wherever else.
02:55:53.28 --> 02:55:57.76 So you got this massive cesspool of bacteria.
02:55:57.76 --> 02:56:01.08 And I'm just all up in it.
02:56:01.08 --> 02:56:02.08 But I got that D.
02:56:02.08 --> 02:56:04.08 Yeah, sure.
02:56:04.08 --> 02:56:05.08 Hey, man.
02:56:05.08 --> 02:56:08.68 So your body was just like, hey, we don't, we don't need antibodies for their little
02:56:08.68 --> 02:56:09.68 lot.
02:56:09.68 --> 02:56:13.12 It's kind of like, you know, when you're in a, like, I don't know, maybe the police
02:56:13.12 --> 02:56:16.80 forces or something like that, where it's like, hey, we have the situation, then the police
02:56:16.80 --> 02:56:19.40 force like mounts up and they're like, okay, what's the situation?
02:56:19.40 --> 02:56:22.40 Then they say the situation, they're like, oh, no, we don't need all these guys.
02:56:22.40 --> 02:56:24.60 It was like, bro, San Fred from the front.
02:56:24.60 --> 02:56:25.60 That's good.
02:56:25.60 --> 02:56:26.60 Whatever.
02:56:26.60 --> 02:56:27.60 He's got that.
02:56:27.60 --> 02:56:28.60 Don't stand the business, you know?
02:56:28.60 --> 02:56:29.60 Whatever.
02:56:29.60 --> 02:56:30.60 So that's what happened.
02:56:30.60 --> 02:56:31.60 Interesting.
02:56:31.60 --> 02:56:32.88 Oh, yeah, the Cold War is there too.
02:56:32.88 --> 02:56:33.88 Also disciplined.

02:58:39.46 --> 02:58:40.46 One nut.
02:58:40.46 --> 02:58:41.46 That's if you want to represent.
02:58:41.46 --> 02:58:42.46 While you're on the path.
02:58:42.46 --> 02:58:43.46 True.
02:58:43.46 --> 02:58:44.46 Very nice.
02:58:44.46 --> 02:58:45.46 Very nice.
02:58:45.46 --> 02:58:46.46 I could not have said it better.
02:58:46.46 --> 02:58:47.46 That is true.
02:58:47.46 --> 02:58:49.46 Also, on Jockel Store.
02:58:49.46 --> 02:58:51.46 We haven't email list.
02:58:51.46 --> 02:58:55.46 I'm not going to use anyone's email ever, ever in my whole life, ever.
02:58:55.46 --> 02:58:56.46 Straight up.
02:58:56.46 --> 02:58:58.46 I'm making that proclamation right now.
02:58:58.46 --> 02:58:59.46 Okay.
02:58:59.46 --> 02:59:00.46 But if you sign up.
02:59:00.46 --> 02:59:04.46 If you want to sign up for our email list.
02:59:04.46 --> 02:59:06.46 When I say, are email lists.
02:59:06.46 --> 02:59:08.46 It's like mining jocgos.
02:59:08.46 --> 02:59:11.46 Those are the only people we're going to email you.
02:59:11.46 --> 02:59:12.46 Straight up.
02:59:12.46 --> 02:59:13.46 So if you want to sign up for this.
02:59:13.46 --> 02:59:16.46 It's mainly going to be store stuff.
02:59:16.46 --> 02:59:19.46 Like, and not like everyday emailing you.
02:59:19.46 --> 02:59:21.46 Oh, we changed the color of our website.
02:59:21.46 --> 02:59:23.46 Brad, I don't, I don't email that can stuff.
02:59:23.46 --> 02:59:25.46 Because I don't think anyone will ever care about that stuff.
02:59:25.46 --> 02:59:27.46 Only if there's like a new design.
02:59:27.46 --> 02:59:29.46 Or, yeah, that's pretty much.
02:59:29.46 --> 02:59:31.46 So maybe like once I'm, I don't know.
02:59:31.46 --> 02:59:32.46 It's not very often.
02:59:32.46 --> 02:59:37.46 But I'm going to put extensive effort into making it.
02:59:37.46 --> 02:59:40.46 Stuff that I really believe that it is worth sending out.
02:59:40.46 --> 02:59:43.46 Seems like worth receiving worth opening up as an email.
02:59:43.46 --> 02:59:46.46 You're making me want to sign up for your email list.
02:59:46.46 --> 02:59:47.46 Just so I can make it.
02:59:47.46 --> 02:59:51.46 Just so I can police you to make sure you're not sending out stuff that you shouldn't be sending out.
02:59:51.46 --> 02:59:52.46 Good.
02:59:52.46 --> 02:59:53.46 I should be.
02:59:53.46 --> 02:59:55.46 No, I'm saying if I was a listener because I am on the email list.
02:59:55.46 --> 02:59:58.46 But if I was just a listener out there in the world, I might go.
02:59:58.46 --> 03:00:00.46 Echo's making a claim.
03:00:00.46 --> 03:00:01.46 Yeah.
03:00:01.46 --> 03:00:02.46 Good.
03:00:02.46 --> 03:00:04.46 I think that that's a good thing to do.
03:00:04.46 --> 03:00:07.46 I would go send a lame email.
03:00:07.46 --> 03:00:08.46 Let me know.
03:00:08.46 --> 03:00:12.46 Respond to it and just say, hey, this was a lame email.
03:00:12.46 --> 03:00:17.46 So maybe check next time you're saying, maybe like, you know, confirm it or something.
03:00:17.46 --> 03:00:18.46 You know, give it a once over.
03:00:18.46 --> 03:00:19.46 I don't know.
03:00:19.46 --> 03:00:23.46 But nonetheless, for real, I respect the inbox.
03:00:23.46 --> 03:00:24.46 Check.
03:00:24.46 --> 03:00:26.46 Also, we got a podcast right now that you're listening to.

03:00:32.46 --> 03:00:34.46 We got the thread that I'm still working on in the name change.
03:00:34.46 --> 03:00:37.46 Every good name I think of is kind of taken some bummed out.
03:00:37.46 --> 03:00:39.46 We have the grounded podcast.
03:00:39.46 --> 03:00:40.46 What's about you?

03:00:41.46 --> 03:00:43.46 We got the warrior kid podcast for your warrior kids.
03:00:43.46 --> 03:00:45.46 We also have a warrior kid soap from Irish Oaks Ranch.com.
03:00:45.46 --> 03:00:49.46 It's also available where on the jockel store dot com.
03:00:49.46 --> 03:00:52.46 Young, eight, making soap building a business.
03:00:52.46 --> 03:00:55.46 Who here was building a business when they were 12 years old.
03:00:55.46 --> 03:00:56.46 Now he's older now.
03:00:56.46 --> 03:00:57.46 But he started that business.
03:00:57.46 --> 03:01:00.46 We were 12 credit.
03:01:00.46 --> 03:01:03.46 Don't forget that we have a YouTube channel.
03:01:03.46 --> 03:01:07.46 And at some point, aquatrawl is going to start putting
03:01:07.46 --> 03:01:14.46 Easter eggs of special effects into the YouTube version of this podcast.
03:01:14.46 --> 03:01:17.46 Maybe a little sound effect and maybe an explosion.
03:01:17.46 --> 03:01:19.46 So good opportunity today.
03:01:19.46 --> 03:01:22.46 Well, the technically those are Easter eggs.
03:01:22.46 --> 03:01:24.46 Okay. What are they?
03:01:24.46 --> 03:01:28.46 I'm the effects. Okay. Well, he's not just sound effects visual effects.
03:01:28.46 --> 03:01:30.46 Maybe some smoke, maybe some fire.
03:01:30.46 --> 03:01:31.46 Maybe some explosions.
03:01:31.46 --> 03:01:35.46 It's funny that you get you make a four minute video.
03:01:35.46 --> 03:01:40.46 And you show 97 explosions, but you do a three hour video and there's nothing in it.
03:01:40.46 --> 03:01:42.46 What do you think people think of that?
03:01:42.46 --> 03:01:45.46 I think explosions have their place in the world.
03:01:45.46 --> 03:01:47.46 You know, and I do too.
03:01:47.46 --> 03:01:52.46 Well, we'll have varying levels of agreement on that whole topic.
03:01:52.46 --> 03:01:54.46 Don't think people would, okay.
03:01:54.46 --> 03:01:57.46 Do you think you think watching a three hour YouTube video is boring?
03:01:57.46 --> 03:02:00.46 Do you and me talking?
03:02:00.46 --> 03:02:03.46 Do you think that might be boring to someone visually?
03:02:03.46 --> 03:02:04.46 Three hours.
03:02:04.46 --> 03:02:08.46 Well, visually boring and boring are two different things.
03:02:08.46 --> 03:02:09.46 I said visually boring.
03:02:09.46 --> 03:02:10.46 Yes or no.
03:02:10.46 --> 03:02:13.46 I can see yes or no.
03:02:13.46 --> 03:02:16.46 If put it this way, well, it's not a yes or no question.
03:02:16.46 --> 03:02:17.46 It is a yes or no question.
03:02:17.46 --> 03:02:22.46 Is it boring to watch three hours of a video of two humans in a black room talking to each other?
03:02:22.46 --> 03:02:23.46 Yes or no?
03:02:23.46 --> 03:02:24.46 Not a yes or no.
03:02:24.46 --> 03:02:25.46 No question.
03:02:25.46 --> 03:02:26.46 It depends with the humans.
03:02:26.46 --> 03:02:27.46 Okay.
03:02:27.46 --> 03:02:28.46 It depends with the talk about politician.
03:02:28.46 --> 03:02:29.46 No.
03:02:29.46 --> 03:02:32.46 We gotta get, you gotta understand.
03:02:32.46 --> 03:02:33.46 Okay.
03:02:33.46 --> 03:02:37.46 Well, let's say it was some subject like someone trying to explain how to cook rice.
03:02:37.46 --> 03:02:39.46 Do you think that might get boring?
03:02:39.46 --> 03:02:46.46 Now, if the rice cooker was blowy,
03:02:46.46 --> 03:02:47.46 I think that would be good.
03:02:47.46 --> 03:02:48.46 Okay.
03:02:48.46 --> 03:02:49.46 People would be stoked.
03:02:49.46 --> 03:02:50.46 I understand.
03:02:50.46 --> 03:02:52.46 If you see where I'm coming from.
03:02:52.46 --> 03:02:53.46 Okay.
03:02:53.46 --> 03:02:54.46 I understand.
03:02:54.46 --> 03:02:55.46 Anyway.
03:02:55.46 --> 03:02:56.46 Yes.
03:02:56.46 --> 03:02:58.46 Subscribe to the YouTube channel.
03:02:58.46 --> 03:03:00.46 Subscribe to the YouTube channel.
03:03:00.46 --> 03:03:03.46 If you want to see that, in echo does make other enhanced videos.
03:03:03.46 --> 03:03:05.46 And if you want to see stuff blow up, you can see it there.
03:03:05.46 --> 03:03:11.46 If you want to see if you want to be bored, then you can watch the four hour podcast.
03:03:11.46 --> 03:03:13.46 It's not boring.
03:03:13.46 --> 03:03:14.46 How about that?
03:03:14.46 --> 03:03:15.46 Okay.
03:03:15.46 --> 03:03:17.46 I'm going to say, visually boring.
03:03:17.46 --> 03:03:19.46 Anyway, psychological warfare.
03:03:19.46 --> 03:03:20.46 Psychological warfare.
03:03:20.46 --> 03:03:23.46 If you're having a moment of weakness, which we all do had one the other day.
03:03:23.46 --> 03:03:24.46 Powered through it.
03:03:24.46 --> 03:03:25.46 By the way.
03:03:25.46 --> 03:03:26.46 What was it?
03:03:26.46 --> 03:03:28.46 Wait, I didn't want to go.
03:03:28.46 --> 03:03:29.46 I didn't feel like it.
03:03:29.46 --> 03:03:30.46 Freaking didn't feel like it.
03:03:30.46 --> 03:03:33.46 But this was like next level didn't feel like it.
03:03:33.46 --> 03:03:37.46 The kind where, you know, the kind where you don't feel like it's so hard for where you're like.
03:03:37.46 --> 03:03:39.46 Man, something might be like wrong with me.
03:03:39.46 --> 03:03:41.46 Like by my physical allergy.
03:03:41.46 --> 03:03:43.46 You know, I wasn't feeling physically weakness, certainly.
03:03:43.46 --> 03:03:45.46 But I was just like, maybe like something's going on.
03:03:45.46 --> 03:03:49.46 Maybe it's like actual like burnout, you know, that deal.
03:03:49.46 --> 03:03:54.46 The only the when I do 20 rep squats, heavy.
03:03:54.46 --> 03:03:58.46 Sometimes while I'm doing them, I'm thinking to myself, I don't care.
03:03:58.46 --> 03:03:59.46 I don't care.
03:03:59.46 --> 03:04:03.46 I don't care if I'm in shape.
03:04:03.46 --> 03:04:06.46 Whatever I'm doing right now, I just, I would rather be watching TV.
03:04:06.46 --> 03:04:07.46 I just want to stop this.
03:04:07.46 --> 03:04:08.46 And that's right.
03:04:08.46 --> 03:04:09.46 That's a bad thing.
03:04:09.46 --> 03:04:10.46 Watch out for that.
03:04:10.46 --> 03:04:11.46 Yeah.
03:04:11.46 --> 03:04:13.46 So the point is, then I get mad about that.
03:04:13.46 --> 03:04:14.46 And then I do.
03:04:14.46 --> 03:04:17.46 Bro, I use that because you and Joe Rogan were talking about that.
03:04:17.46 --> 03:04:19.46 How you like get mad at yourself.
03:04:19.46 --> 03:04:22.46 And here's the thing that it's easy to be like,
03:04:22.46 --> 03:04:23.46 Oh, that's a good thing.
03:04:23.46 --> 03:04:24.46 I'm going to try that.
03:04:24.46 --> 03:04:27.46 But if you don't genuinely get mad at yourself, it totally doesn't work.
03:04:27.46 --> 03:04:30.46 Like you can kind of get mad at yourself or maybe feel guilty later.
03:04:30.46 --> 03:04:31.46 But that's different.
03:04:31.46 --> 03:04:32.46 That's not the same thing.
03:04:32.46 --> 03:04:36.46 If you're for real mad at yourself that you literally deserve punishment.
03:04:36.46 --> 03:04:37.46 Immediately.
03:04:37.46 --> 03:04:40.46 Like right now for your ways.
03:04:40.46 --> 03:04:41.46 Load up the bar.
03:04:41.46 --> 03:04:42.46 Yep.
03:04:42.46 --> 03:04:43.46 Exactly.
03:04:43.46 --> 03:04:44.46 Or the bar and get under there and get something.
03:04:44.46 --> 03:04:46.46 Man, if you can get there, if you can pull it off mentally,
03:04:46.46 --> 03:04:48.46 very, very helpful.
03:04:48.46 --> 03:04:51.46 By the way, but let's say you can't, let's say you can't.

03:07:15.46 --> 03:07:21.46 So the amount of seats that we have available might be smaller than what would normally be available.

03:08:43.46 --> 03:08:45.46 Especially those, yes, especially those.
03:08:45.46 --> 03:08:51.46 Those iron soldiers of the second brigade, 28th Infantry Division.
03:08:51.46 --> 03:08:55.46 For your service and your sacrifice in the battle or money.

03:09:24.46 --> 03:09:28.46 You're doing all that hard work out there, getting very little support.
03:09:28.46 --> 03:09:31.46 We'll just remember that there are a lot of people that know what you do.
03:09:31.46 --> 03:09:37.46 Know the risks that you take and know how many people you help.
03:09:37.46 --> 03:09:44.46 Then everyone else out there, we do not know everything.
03:09:44.46 --> 03:09:50.46 We do not win every time we all make mistakes.
03:09:50.46 --> 03:09:54.46 Learn from them.
03:09:54.46 --> 03:09:57.46 Learn from them and get better.
03:09:57.46 --> 03:10:05.46 Then get back on the path and of course get after it.
03:10:05.46 --> 03:10:09.46 And until next time, this is Echo and Jockel.
03:10:09.46 --> 03:10:36.46 Out.
