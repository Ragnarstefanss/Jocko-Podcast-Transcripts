You know he's a black belt on the black belt He's like what degree are you and I was like, I don't know I don't know I got my black belt in 2005. So he's like hey, you know, and it started with when we were young when we're young young like 7-8 years old we'd sit on his lap So he do the shifting in the gas in the break and stuff like that dirt roads We'd just do the steering so what it kind of started with then after while he's like it's it'll jam you up just that whole mindset one thing You know, I would say to those people that might be thinking that way For my perspective and for many due to instructors The your you're advancing and you're getting promoted Based on your potential not based on your skill level to Yeah, because you might be You might not have a lot of potential and so you know what hey man the guys you know he can't train he's You know 68 years old and he's been training for a year and a half Yeah, you know like you have that clear vision I that's natural thing to be like a blue belt and I wish I could wear that purple belt and everyone who didn't know me and respect me as a pro belt but just to keep track of where I am just like like like like like the bookmark. The position yeah exactly right, but no one's gonna automatically know that's not you know you're trying to beat up the guy on my back and punch him Let me punch him but no, it's just one other many examples Next question Jocco my boss is incredibly controlling an eagle maniacor I would like him already Eagle mania come right I need to learn whatever he knows Teach to me whatever you know because I don't want to feel that way ever Bro, and then you're training it like let's say you train for five years for five years you're training not It gets people who don't know you're training against people who do you know and actually I've done this thing where I got used to only getting like six six and a half and it it started to work like I Sort of leave them you know, I didn't like that I tried to go back to actually I only get six maybe seven now anyway I don't know anything where it's like striking based or whatever It's like you it like I've said this for I'm not gonna go deep in it, but you go from zero to ten when you throw a strike That's already a 10. like I've rewired my parts my house I've replummed parts my house so don't all the plumbing in parts my house now if you watch a skilled Electrition do what I'm doing it would literally take him One eight of the time maybe one quarter of the time because or like the drywall or we were talking about early a good drywall or They are like masters a good electrician masters a good plumber their smooth Me but yeah, he knew and you could tell he was like kind of prideful That he would train with oriental whatever, but he got so you know, he's gonna pull him in between his guard like that's I like like you all I mean I like you all because some of your comments are don't like yeah. anyway At him it was time to roll round to you say hey there Adam was like hey, you know, there's some new people here No day zero days whatever Experience can you don't know teach or something you know as the rounds are going on because I didn't have a partner I didn't have came in late whatever, but so I went I'm gonna shoot you know, I'm gonna shoot that's a good good skill to have Also read right read About history read about survival read about the world read about human beings under Dress read Read books Good books About good stuff About challenges. and then I do a little quiz at the end I said okay boom boom we fight it's like a half speed we fight boom we fall to the ground What do you want to be and you know, so it's like a little quiz and boom right there that five minutes You learn everything that I learned from watching you have seen one two three Making him feel not he is running things And because because you can absolutely lead from the shadows If your ego allows it because a lot of times when we want when we lead we want everyone to know that we're leading I want everyone to know that I'm in charge I want them to know that I'm the man right? Do like I was expecting it right which should tell you something Yes, I wasn't in there like tonight's probably gonna be big no, no, I like showed up at the gym and Trained or whatever so she grabs it and this is like a kind of like one of those pro speed ropes, you know, so it's like kind of Okay, so your like is my like is Serious meanings my like does not mean like I'll be good so good man and that's That's so good on you because you know everyone is feeling the threat like what you're saying for sure It's like dang where is this guy? He was he didn't like how we felt I felt like he should do something and he felt like a wimp basically when you know that you can destroy someone Then it doesn't matter you just think they're an idiot. And we pout you know we go through that we continue on and The cartoon chief in the back he says something on the radio something along the lines of he's like you know Comes up on the radio you take hey, Jocco you know we we just got hit with an ambush back here and You know I knew about him that's why I was talking about him on the the Facebook live because I because I had seen him and I had known that like a like a like a possessed psychopath He wanted to make geese in America so we went and found Looms to weave material with and all that stuff But when I walked up to him, you know you could see that he was panicking because you know you got we had a bunch of vehicles You know you got seven vehicles with us and and They're all driving around and I've done two laps around the you know it's not fun and I think that This it's like a matter of perspective kit first off you being a black belt and thinking that or whatever and be like yeah, that's Easy it seems like that's obvious that and it has been a little while since we got down to some Q&A sure and on top of that On the social media I have not been as As responsive as I normally am I've had to prioritize and execute a bunch of other things Things like master things like books that are due Things like that You know just like how you said like you like how I warm up with Andy hey You're just doing some good stretching you're doing some mobility wand That's mobility work out of the day you can go to that website They got really good stuff on there to loosen up and make sure you're staying remember because the another thing you find with construction guys is They end up with some you know with a bad back with a bad they get you know Ten to night is from swinging a hammer all day or holding it so you can get those kind of use over-use injuries and Right it actually means that you should remain humble that you should take input from them That you can still take advice from them as opposed to just giving them advice all those things are fine and I just kind of asked this question the other day a young construction business and a kid and we were in a big meeting with a bunch of leadership from forming to engineers All in the same room a bunch of great guys from a great company and You want to the young engineers raised his hand and said, you know, I'm Young and I am going to be in charge of these guys You know, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with these guys that've been doing it for a while longer. Yeah, so I would look at what you can do that's gonna complement that also maybe you feel like You maybe you just need to do some heavy lifting because you're lifting something little all day You know you lift and dry all day so That's it started with geese That's definitely a huge focus, but we're gonna make everything We're gonna build the best gear in the world not just for geetsu But for everything you do in life we're gonna make the best gear for Being on the war path That's what we're gonna do so we'll come out with a bunch of details that's the big announcement that was gonna come I just made it And you know you make it through and like pass the enemy one time you got away with who yeah now you went by him three times It's not cool and every one of the whole But true because sitting there in the vehicles going hold on jackass is gonna run us by this check point again So you know, so you can do that and you can get like a good movement good rolling Without that impact you know when everyone's in all you got to turn up the heat or whatever on a guy Because that comes from ego. Yeah, you can't let that happen So don't let your ego get in the way you might not want if you have all those serious injuries like it sounds like you have You may not want to roll with anybody for a long time until you really truly understand Jiu Jitsu so that's question number one. Yeah, that's belt I would say this happens more times than not If you're below belt you're rolling you're getting good you're learning a lot when you get a purple But purple belt that's gonna empower you so much to be like now my standard just mentally is higher now I'm a purple belt now. He's gonna play him some rounds up at the machine gun nest while he's doing that I'm gonna screw you away like a little baby like a little sneaky little squirrel No, I'm gonna try for like hey, you know what I think they're good, but you think it'd be go over better if they're even a little bit So this he goes Just to sort of like you know it's Wednesday, you know we have that but that podcast we recorded that's you know and then we both kind of just had a mutual Agreement on unspoken agreement that we were done for the day That happened but the point there being is in almost like in this weird way You know how like intellectually you can excel so you can kind of find it justifiable to avoid the physical part of it I hear yourself but being able to defend yourself is a whole other thing than being physically strong At you know seems obvious, but when you go through life, I think it's not because you get these like big jack guys and it's like no one wants to mess with him but I got a text message I think there might even been a phone call on it was a phone call and a text message from you This you know this is This is something you know I'm like right what is your one what it was? There we know you got to think when you're in a leadership position Not that I'm like the leader here, but if you're in a leadership position you don't know what someone else is going through I maybe you had some technical issue It's good to go and then what I would do is and I've worked some trucks before and We're even made projects on my house where I'm working all day long Remodeling pulling down drywall, putting up drywall demo in rooms whatever I still do we work out now what you're gonna do though is do something that is going to complement What you've done during the day so you're getting some pretty good strength for work at this point You're getting you know you're getting clean your grip work. and and I think that this isn't like he's like Brandon talk about you know to master any crafts I think it's the same with any craft that you're trying to master
