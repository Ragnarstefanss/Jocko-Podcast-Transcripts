00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.08
This is Jockel Podcast number 62 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:19.04
echo. Good evening. The smallest detail taken from an actual incident in war is more

3
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:27.20
instructive for me a soldier than all the fears and jomones in the world. They speak no doubt

4
00:00:27.20 --> 00:00:34.80
for the heads of states and armies, but they never show me what I wish to know, a battalion,

5
00:00:34.80 --> 00:00:42.40
a company, a squad in action. Concerning a regiment, a battalion, a company of squad,

6
00:00:42.40 --> 00:00:49.60
it is interesting to know the disposition taken to meet the enemy or order for the march

7
00:00:49.60 --> 00:00:56.56
toward them. What becomes of this disposition or this march order under the isolated or combined

8
00:00:56.56 --> 00:01:04.24
influences of accents of the terrain and the approach of the danger? Is this order changed or

9
00:01:04.24 --> 00:01:13.20
is it continued in force when approaching the enemy? What becomes of it arriving within the range

10
00:01:13.20 --> 00:01:21.44
of the guns, within the range of the bullets? At what distance is a voluntary or an order

11
00:01:21.44 --> 00:01:27.44
disposition taken before starting operations for commencing fire for charging or for both?

12
00:01:29.76 --> 00:01:36.000
How did the fight start? How about the firing? How did the man adapt themselves?

13
00:01:36.88 --> 00:01:44.56
How was the charge made? At what distance did the enemy flee before it? At what distance did the

14
00:01:44.56 --> 00:01:50.72
charge fall back before the fire or the good order and good dissident dispositions of the enemy?

15
00:01:50.72 --> 00:02:01.84
Or before such and such a movement of the enemy? What did it cost? What can be said about all

16
00:02:01.84 --> 00:02:11.60
these with reference to the enemy? What about the behavior? I.e. the order, the disordered,

17
00:02:11.60 --> 00:02:17.76
the shouts, the silence, the confusion, the calmness of the officers and men, whether with us

18
00:02:17.76 --> 00:02:26.48
or with the enemy before during and after combat? How has the soldier been controlled and directed

19
00:02:26.48 --> 00:02:35.36
during the action? At what instant has he had a tendency to quit the line in order to remain behind

20
00:02:35.36 --> 00:02:43.76
or rush ahead? At what moment? If the control were escaping the leader's hands?

21
00:02:43.76 --> 00:02:52.80
Has it no longer been possible to exercise it? At what instant has this control escape from the

22
00:02:52.80 --> 00:03:00.40
battalion commander? When from the captain? The section leader or the squad leader? What time?

23
00:03:00.96 --> 00:03:06.88
In short, if such a thing did take place, was there but a disordered impulse?

24
00:03:06.88 --> 00:03:15.04
Whether to the front or to the rear, carrying a long, pale male with it, both leaders and men?

25
00:03:17.52 --> 00:03:23.60
Where and when did the halt take place? Where and when were the leaders able to resume control of the

26
00:03:23.60 --> 00:03:31.60
men? At what moments before during or after the day was the battalion roll call? The company roll call made?

27
00:03:31.60 --> 00:03:40.72
The results of these roll calls? What were they? How many dead? How many mooned, wounded on the side?

28
00:03:41.76 --> 00:03:46.64
And on the other side? The kind of wounds of the officers, non-commissioned officers,

29
00:03:46.64 --> 00:03:54.000
corpus, privates, etc. All these details in a word and lighten either the material or the

30
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.76
moral side of the action or enable it to be visualized? Possibly a closer examination might show

31
00:04:03.76 --> 00:04:10.40
that they are matters infinitely more instructive to us as soldiers than all the discussions imaginable

32
00:04:10.40 --> 00:04:15.92
on the plans and general conduct of campaigns of the greatest captain in the great movements of the

33
00:04:15.92 --> 00:04:26.96
battlefield. From kernel to private we are soldiers, not generals, and it is therefore our trade

34
00:04:26.96 --> 00:04:34.72
that we desire to know. Certainly one cannot obtain all the details of the same incident,

35
00:04:35.76 --> 00:04:41.44
but from a series of true accounts, there should emanate an ensemble of characteristic

36
00:04:41.44 --> 00:04:47.68
details which in themselves are very apt to show in a striking irrefutable way what was

37
00:04:47.68 --> 00:04:53.52
necessarily and forcibly taking place at such in such a moment of an action in war.

38
00:04:55.84 --> 00:05:02.000
Take the estimate of a soldier obtained in this manner to serve as a base for what might possibly

39
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.64
be a rational method of fighting. It will put us on guard against a priori or pedantic school

40
00:05:12.64 --> 00:05:24.40
methods. Whoever has seen turns to a method based on his knowledge, his personal experience as a soldier,

41
00:05:24.40 --> 00:05:35.28
but experience is long and life is short. The experiences of each cannot therefore be

42
00:05:35.28 --> 00:05:53.44
completed except by those of others. Proofs have weight. And that right there is an excerpt from a letter

43
00:05:54.64 --> 00:06:03.20
by a French officer in the French army named Arden Dubique. He was in the French army in the

44
00:06:03.20 --> 00:06:15.04
mid-1800s which had him then fighting in the Crimean War. 1855, he was in Syria. During the

45
00:06:15.04 --> 00:06:25.12
sectarian violence of 1860 and 1861, he saw service now, Gerea from 1864 to 1866. And finally,

46
00:06:25.12 --> 00:06:34.32
he was a regimental commander during the outbreak of the Franco Prussian War where he served as the

47
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:45.36
commander for 33 days of his regiment from 15 July 1870 until 18 August 1870 when he was

48
00:06:46.80 --> 00:06:49.76
severely wounded by Shrapnel and eventually died of those wounds.

49
00:06:49.76 --> 00:07:01.60
So, there's something that I really like about this guy, Arden Dubique. And that is that he likes

50
00:07:01.60 --> 00:07:10.08
what I like. He is interested in what I am interested in and that is primarily human nature.

51
00:07:10.08 --> 00:07:22.48
People and human beings and how they act under stress and under fear and in the face of death

52
00:07:22.48 --> 00:07:32.24
and then more important, how do you lead in those situations? Then he recognized

53
00:07:32.24 --> 00:07:42.64
that war while just like today, it certainly involves tactics and strategy and technology

54
00:07:42.64 --> 00:07:59.12
and politics, but war at its core is about people. Men, human beings. And therefore, the general

55
00:07:59.12 --> 00:08:06.24
and the captain and the sergeant and the lieutenant in order for them to master war,

56
00:08:08.56 --> 00:08:14.40
they first have to master their understanding of human nature.

57
00:08:16.80 --> 00:08:23.44
And that is what he looked at and that is what we will look at tonight and obviously

58
00:08:23.44 --> 00:08:34.40
when you look at human nature in the context of war, it does not change when you put it in the

59
00:08:34.40 --> 00:08:46.000
context of life, the rest of life. Now, as we know combat is like life put amplified and intensified.

60
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.12
So, when you see the emotions and the human nature in war, it's much clearer, it's much easier to see

61
00:08:51.12 --> 00:08:58.56
than it is off the battlefield in regular life in the business world. But when you know the undercurrents,

62
00:09:00.72 --> 00:09:08.72
it makes you that much better of a leader. And dupeak, like many other great military leaders,

63
00:09:08.72 --> 00:09:16.08
especially ones that I've seen to like, use a little bit of a rebel, spoke his mind,

64
00:09:16.08 --> 00:09:23.28
kind of like, kind of like hackworth, kind of like patent. He called it out when he saw things going

65
00:09:23.28 --> 00:09:32.32
wrong. He called it out when he saw slack, slack that would lead to poorly trained and therefore,

66
00:09:32.32 --> 00:09:43.84
poorly prepared troops. So luckily he wrote a lot of his work down. This is a work called

67
00:09:43.84 --> 00:09:49.44
Battle Studies and unfortunately he didn't finish it because he was killed. But he got a lot

68
00:09:49.44 --> 00:10:02.96
done and it is a lot of lessons to be learned in here. So with that, let's go ahead and go back to the book.

69
00:10:06.48 --> 00:10:12.24
Now, this is his critique. Remember I said he was a little bit of a rebel. So this is a talking

70
00:10:12.24 --> 00:10:19.12
about Frederick the Great on Manuvers. And here's what he said. The Great Mistake and Inspections

71
00:10:20.40 --> 00:10:26.24
is that you officers amuse yourself with God knows what buffoonries and never dream in the least

72
00:10:26.24 --> 00:10:32.72
of serious servers. This is a source of stupidity which would become most dangerous in case of

73
00:10:32.72 --> 00:10:38.24
serious conflict. Take shoemakers and tailors and make generals of them and they will not

74
00:10:38.24 --> 00:10:44.16
commit worse follies. These blunders are made on a small as well as a large scale.

75
00:10:44.16 --> 00:10:49.20
Consequently in the Greatest Number of Regiments the Private is not well-trained. In

76
00:10:49.20 --> 00:10:56.16
Serambus Regiment he is the worst. In Fatans he amounts to nothing and no more in callers,

77
00:10:56.80 --> 00:11:02.96
ear latch or haggers. Why? Because the officers are lazy and try to get out of a difficulty

78
00:11:02.96 --> 00:11:09.92
by giving themselves the least possible trouble. Call them out the slack and that was a bunch

79
00:11:09.92 --> 00:11:14.000
of obviously a bunch of regimental commanders that he's saying these guys are not good at what they're

80
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.16
doing and they're not jitting after with their guys and getting them trained up and ready to rock

81
00:11:20.16 --> 00:11:29.76
and roll. So this is where he kind of lays out what I was talking about and his view of war

82
00:11:29.76 --> 00:11:38.24
being primarily about man. Back to the book. Battle is the objective, battle is the final objective

83
00:11:38.24 --> 00:11:46.40
of armies and man is the fundamental instrument in battle. Nothing can wisely be prescribed in any

84
00:11:46.40 --> 00:11:53.28
army. It's personnel, organization, discipline and tactics, things which are connected like the

85
00:11:53.28 --> 00:12:01.36
fingers of a hand without exact knowledge of the fundamental instrument, man, and his state of mind,

86
00:12:02.16 --> 00:12:10.32
his morale at the instant of combat. It often happens that those who discuss war taking the weapon

87
00:12:10.32 --> 00:12:17.44
for the starting point. Assume unhesitatingly that the man called the servant will always use it

88
00:12:17.44 --> 00:12:24.64
as contemplated and ordered by the regulations. But such a being throwing off his variable

89
00:12:24.64 --> 00:12:32.40
nature to become an impassive pawn and abstract unit in the combinations of battle is a creature

90
00:12:32.40 --> 00:12:40.40
born of the musings of the library. So legit. So you say, like, oh, you think these guys are going

91
00:12:40.40 --> 00:12:44.40
to go out and just do what you tell them to do? That's that's a fantasy that you can only find

92
00:12:44.40 --> 00:12:52.000
in the library. You won't find it back to the book and not a real man. Man is flesh and blood.

93
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.92
He is body and soul. And strong as the soul often is, it cannot dominate the body to the point where

94
00:12:59.92 --> 00:13:05.68
there will be a will that where there will not be a revolt of the flesh and mental

95
00:13:05.68 --> 00:13:16.88
petribution in the face of destruction. The human heart to quote Marshall Disax is then the

96
00:13:16.88 --> 00:13:29.76
starting point in all matters pertaining to war. Boom. Think about that. And it's the same thing

97
00:13:29.76 --> 00:13:37.12
with leadership overall. People. So what you're doing? You create cool technology. You make a great

98
00:13:37.12 --> 00:13:41.12
product. You want to build a business. You've got to understand people. You got to understand human

99
00:13:41.12 --> 00:13:49.92
nature. Back to the book. The best masters are those who know man best. The man of today

100
00:13:49.92 --> 00:13:56.16
and the man of history. Oh, you've got to understand history. This knowledge naturally comes from a

101
00:13:56.16 --> 00:14:01.92
study of formations and achievements in ancient war. Boom. Look at what's going on in the past.

102
00:14:01.92 --> 00:14:08.16
That's one of the reasons that I read books in the first place. Because I want to understand what

103
00:14:08.16 --> 00:14:13.52
happened in the past. Understand though how those human beings reacted to these situations. I want to know

104
00:14:13.52 --> 00:14:25.28
that. I want to know that. Back to the book. We shall learn to distrust mathematics and material

105
00:14:25.28 --> 00:14:33.44
dynamics as applied to battle principles. We shall learn to be aware of the illustrations drawn

106
00:14:33.44 --> 00:14:37.52
from the range and the maneuver field. So the range where you go shoot a gun and no one shoot

107
00:14:37.52 --> 00:14:40.56
back to you. Right. Oh, we're going to shoot the gun and no one's going to shoot it back.

108
00:14:40.56 --> 00:14:46.16
Oh, hey, if this guy can shoot 10 rounds a minute and hit his target on the range, that means

109
00:14:46.16 --> 00:14:49.28
I can take him out on the battlefield and he'll be able to shoot 10 rounds a minute and hit his target

110
00:14:49.28 --> 00:14:53.76
wrong answer. You don't know that. That's actually wrong. He's going to shoot 100 rounds a minute.

111
00:14:53.76 --> 00:14:56.72
He's going to miss his target all of them because he's going to be freaking out.

112
00:15:00.88 --> 00:15:06.32
Back to the book. There. Oh, and the maneuver field is where you go on. You march around.

113
00:15:06.32 --> 00:15:10.32
And this is training field too. Right. You go out. You march around a training field or you go around

114
00:15:11.12 --> 00:15:16.40
even when you try, you know, I see some military units, they simulate combat and it's so cheesy.

115
00:15:17.36 --> 00:15:21.44
It's got to be hard. You got to have chaos in there. Back to the book.

116
00:15:21.44 --> 00:15:30.40
There. Experiences with the calm settled, unfitied, attentive, obedient soldier with an intelligent

117
00:15:30.40 --> 00:15:37.12
and tractable man instrument, insured. So that's what that's what you have in the training

118
00:15:37.12 --> 00:15:42.96
situation. All those things calm settled, unfitied, the 10 of all those things. This is what

119
00:15:42.96 --> 00:15:48.96
you really get back to the book and not with the nervous, easily swayed, moved, troubled,

120
00:15:48.96 --> 00:15:55.60
distraint, excited, restless, being not even under self control who is the fighting man

121
00:15:55.60 --> 00:16:03.76
from general to private. There are strong men exceptions, but they are rare.

122
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:08.08
And he mentions that throughout here. Of course, you're going to get guys that are super calm and

123
00:16:08.08 --> 00:16:13.12
super courageous. He mentions that throughout this. But from general to private,

124
00:16:13.12 --> 00:16:18.16
get the guy that's not going to be the same on the battlefield as he is in training.

125
00:16:20.48 --> 00:16:26.40
Let us then study man in battle for it is he who really fights.

126
00:16:29.68 --> 00:16:36.24
Man does not enter battle to fight, but for victory. He does everything that he can to avoid the

127
00:16:36.24 --> 00:16:43.60
first and obtain the second. Boom. Now we start kidding a little psychology here. A man

128
00:16:43.60 --> 00:16:49.92
surprised, leads an instant to collect his thoughts and defend himself. During this instant, he is killed

129
00:16:51.04 --> 00:16:58.56
if he does not run away. Fighter flight. The surprise to adversary does not defend himself. He tries to

130
00:16:58.56 --> 00:17:04.24
flee. So there you go. That's why you're one of the tenants of seal combat is surprise.

131
00:17:04.24 --> 00:17:08.80
Surprise and violence of action. We are going to surprise you because everybody when you get

132
00:17:08.80 --> 00:17:16.32
surprised, it's you're defending yourself. And in many cases, running away, that's your best action.

133
00:17:21.28 --> 00:17:26.80
Back to the book, man taxes is ingenuity to be able to kill without running the risk of being killed.

134
00:17:27.52 --> 00:17:32.000
This is so fundamental. Think about that. Man taxes is ingenuity to be able to kill without

135
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.56
running the risk of being killed. That's what all modern weapons are for. Can I shoot this guy

136
00:17:36.56 --> 00:17:41.60
from 500 yards away? Think that's what I want. You know, we make guns now that shoot around corners.

137
00:17:41.60 --> 00:17:47.68
We drop bombs from the sky. We want to kill without the risk of being killed. Back to the book,

138
00:17:47.68 --> 00:17:57.28
his bravery is born of his strength and is not absolute. Before a stronger, he flees without shame.

139
00:17:57.28 --> 00:18:05.28
So, and he puts out this is what's cool about. Dupique is he's done this massive amount of historical

140
00:18:05.28 --> 00:18:10.80
studies and he cites all these situations. And he's like, you know, when you're in a bad situation

141
00:18:10.80 --> 00:18:15.68
and you're confusing a stronger enemy, you can just count on the guys are going to run away.

142
00:18:15.68 --> 00:18:18.96
Guys are not going to send up here. How many times have you seen that in a street fight?

143
00:18:19.68 --> 00:18:24.64
Right. As soon as the big friend steps in and says, wait a second, you've got to be here with my buddy.

144
00:18:24.64 --> 00:18:29.20
Oh, no, no, no, no, I got no problem here. Echo Charles, I'm good. I didn't realize there was a big

145
00:18:29.20 --> 00:18:38.72
yoke to lie in over here getting ready kicked my butt. So, he's saying that bravery is born of strength.

146
00:18:38.72 --> 00:18:43.12
And everyone's strong. Everyone's brave when you got 12 people with you and you're going to fight

147
00:18:43.12 --> 00:18:48.16
one guy. Everyone's brave. When you reverse those roles, doesn't always turn out that way.

148
00:18:48.16 --> 00:18:59.20
Back to the book, collective man, a disciplined body of troops formed in tactical battle order

149
00:18:59.20 --> 00:19:06.88
is invincible against an undisciplined body of troops. Boom. But against a similar,

150
00:19:06.88 --> 00:19:14.64
similar to a disciplined body, he becomes again primitive man. He flees before a greater force

151
00:19:14.64 --> 00:19:21.44
of destruction when he recognizes it or when he foresees it. Nothing is changed in the heart of man,

152
00:19:21.44 --> 00:19:28.40
disciplined keeps enemies face to face a little longer. But it cannot supplant the instinct of

153
00:19:28.40 --> 00:19:37.60
self preservation and the sense of fear that goes with it. Fear. There are officers and soldiers who

154
00:19:37.60 --> 00:19:45.92
do not know it, but they are people of rare grit. The mass shutters, because you cannot suppress

155
00:19:45.92 --> 00:19:52.16
the flesh. This trembling must be taken into account in all organizations, discipline,

156
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:58.32
arrangements, movements, maneuvers, mode of action. All of these are affected by the human weakness

157
00:19:58.32 --> 00:20:05.36
of the soldier which causes him to magnify the strength of the enemy. This faltering is studied

158
00:20:05.36 --> 00:20:14.64
in ancient combat. It is seen that of nations, act in war. The strongest have been those who not only

159
00:20:14.64 --> 00:20:23.44
best have understood the general conduct of war, but who have taken human weakness into greatest

160
00:20:23.44 --> 00:20:33.04
account and then taken the best guarantees against it. Powerful. Now what's really interesting

161
00:20:33.04 --> 00:20:40.24
is when you start when you think about some of these true combat stories, this guy is around in

162
00:20:40.24 --> 00:20:46.64
the 1860s. The stories that we've talked about on this podcast, what makes them so phenomenal

163
00:20:46.64 --> 00:20:56.08
is that you can see US Army soldiers, US Marines just completely defying what he's saying here.

164
00:20:56.08 --> 00:21:03.36
That's a bigger stronger force. We're surrounded by Chinese Army at the chosen reservoir.

165
00:21:03.36 --> 00:21:07.52
Cool. We're going to fight them. Are we going to run away? No. We're going to go.

166
00:21:08.72 --> 00:21:15.20
And we're going to stand. So that makes these modern warfare situations even more impressive

167
00:21:16.16 --> 00:21:24.96
because you realize that the general, as he says, the mass shutters, the mass shutters, so most people

168
00:21:24.96 --> 00:21:32.16
they shudder with fear and it breaks them down. And even for me and I've talked about this,

169
00:21:32.16 --> 00:21:41.68
you know, like people always want to ask about sea old training. And it's okay, you're

170
00:21:41.68 --> 00:21:45.76
cold in your wet and you've got to do a bunch of push ups. You can't sleep that much. Oh, and you can't sleep

171
00:21:45.76 --> 00:21:53.84
a bunch. But they're also feeding you a bunch and it's fun, right? Sure. But you compare that to

172
00:21:53.84 --> 00:22:01.84
you know, that stuff doesn't even, it's not, it's nothing. And my favorite example to compare that to

173
00:22:02.56 --> 00:22:08.000
is you know a guy when we were in Ramadi, you got the guy that's the lead turret gunner going out

174
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.36
and up a troll in a Humvee. So he's up above the Humvee exposed the enemy and that guy

175
00:22:14.24 --> 00:22:19.04
went on the way out the gate in Ramadi. You drive by this vehicle graveyard where there was

176
00:22:19.04 --> 00:22:24.72
100 vehicles that were blown up and destroyed by ID's. And ID's going to hit the first vehicle. I mean,

177
00:22:24.72 --> 00:22:30.64
most of them go off and, right? So there's that guy. He's going to be up there and we're, and I'm watching

178
00:22:30.64 --> 00:22:35.52
this guy go out on Operation after Operation. I marked Lee as primary turret gunner on many

179
00:22:35.52 --> 00:22:44.000
operations. That's why I remember it really clearly. But same thing, like there's no way that those

180
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.52
guys and that's one. Of course you got every guy in the vehicle to get out the army guys that are

181
00:22:47.52 --> 00:22:53.12
out for the Marines. These are guys that I've seen. All of them. Looking at this situation,

182
00:22:53.12 --> 00:22:58.80
knowing that death is a high possibility. I won't call the probability. That's a high possibility.

183
00:22:58.80 --> 00:23:04.000
But you know what? Roger that. Yeah. It's rocking wrong. You know when you say,

184
00:23:05.36 --> 00:23:11.76
bud's training is easy. Do you think? I mean, obviously that's some effect. But you know how you go through

185
00:23:11.76 --> 00:23:17.04
bud's training and that's kind of the thing. Like, they got through bud's training that, you know,

186
00:23:17.04 --> 00:23:22.08
I'm tough kind of thing. And then after you go to combat, do you look back on bud's training

187
00:23:22.08 --> 00:23:28.80
and that's what's making it seem like it's easy? I just thought it was fun for me. Yeah. I

188
00:23:29.20 --> 00:23:35.68
into the funny thing is it's not like bud's, I mean, I was not a great athlete. So it was hard

189
00:23:35.68 --> 00:23:41.04
for me to pass the time to have illusions. And I failed some time to have illusions. And they have

190
00:23:41.04 --> 00:23:45.12
a special way of making people fail things. I mean, yeah, yeah. At the time we do four

191
00:23:45.12 --> 00:23:49.52
mile time runs that were five mile time runs. But we didn't know that. We just had to run as hard as we

192
00:23:49.52 --> 00:23:55.84
could. And you know, we had swims that there's a like, you know, a strong ocean current going the

193
00:23:55.84 --> 00:24:00.16
opposite direction. You know, everyone in the class would fail. Like, I failed to swim like that.

194
00:24:00.16 --> 00:24:05.44
Everyone in the class failed except for two swim pairs. The two guys that swam and college,

195
00:24:05.44 --> 00:24:11.84
whatever, those four guys passed everyone else failed. Right. So yeah, I failed that. So I'm not

196
00:24:11.84 --> 00:24:16.32
saying buds was easy. Although there are guys that are great athletes and they have an easy time with

197
00:24:16.32 --> 00:24:21.12
the physical part too. And then there's guys that have an easy time with the mental part,

198
00:24:21.12 --> 00:24:27.36
which is probably where I fell into because I was having a good time. Yeah. And yeah, you know,

199
00:24:28.48 --> 00:24:32.48
but I think, yes, I think once I think once you get to combat, because there's, you know,

200
00:24:32.48 --> 00:24:36.56
there's times where guys that obviously are seals made it through buds, they don't want to be

201
00:24:36.56 --> 00:24:43.60
in combat. No, there's that happens. Yeah, because in combat, just to begin with, never mind,

202
00:24:43.60 --> 00:24:49.12
firefight's never just just starting off your mindset is I could die today. Yeah, I was just

203
00:24:49.12 --> 00:24:53.92
starting off regardless of what happens or doesn't happen. I could die today in buds. You would

204
00:24:53.92 --> 00:24:57.44
think even though buds guys died, but yeah, but very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

205
00:24:57.44 --> 00:25:03.92
what I mean, so it's like chances are I'm not going to die today. Yeah. You know, very slim, very few

206
00:25:03.92 --> 00:25:08.08
people usually when people die in buds, they have some kind of a pre-existing condition,

207
00:25:08.08 --> 00:25:10.80
with they have some kind of a heart trouble that didn't get picked up and they have some kind of

208
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:16.56
brain trouble and all of a sudden the pressure of water or whatever they, they unfortunately get

209
00:25:16.56 --> 00:25:20.96
killed in these horrible situations. But it's a very rare. Right. Very, very, very, very, very,

210
00:25:20.96 --> 00:25:25.92
especially you compare it to a combat situation. Yeah. Right when you get off the what the plane,

211
00:25:25.92 --> 00:25:32.16
yeah, you're like, okay, you know, that and that's just starting out. Just that's like a 100%

212
00:25:33.04 --> 00:25:37.68
chance that that's on your mind. Yeah. That whole time. Yeah. I mean, it's a factor, you know what I mean?

213
00:25:37.68 --> 00:25:42.16
It is definitely a factor. So yeah, what I'm adding thinking back. Oh, yeah, but not that hard.

214
00:25:42.16 --> 00:25:46.48
Yeah, I remember thinking about this, the guys that came in relieved us in Ramadi,

215
00:25:46.48 --> 00:25:55.36
select the next task you that came over who were a bunch of great guys and it been a long time since

216
00:25:55.36 --> 00:26:01.04
seals had been in sustained urban combat like that and suffered pretty significant casualties.

217
00:26:01.04 --> 00:26:06.64
Like we did into you, Bruser and those guys, I was friends with good friends with a number of the

218
00:26:06.64 --> 00:26:12.08
guys in there and and so we're late and the other, you know, all the guys we had friends that were back,

219
00:26:12.88 --> 00:26:18.88
you know, back in the in that task and that was coming to relieve us and it's taking what you're

220
00:26:18.88 --> 00:26:25.92
saying and multiplying it times a lot because when we went to Ramadi, we weren't really sure, you know,

221
00:26:25.92 --> 00:26:32.24
oh, yeah, there's a lot of bad guys there and we'll get after it, but it's different when you get there

222
00:26:32.24 --> 00:26:36.80
and then you start going on operations and you realize, yeah, this is this is this is going to be

223
00:26:36.80 --> 00:26:42.80
a long deployment and the chances of us making it through this deployment without suffering

224
00:26:42.80 --> 00:26:48.64
any casualties is actually zero. It's zero. Like this is not going to happen. And when those

225
00:26:48.64 --> 00:26:57.92
guys came over again, a bunch of great dudes, you know, I talked to him when we got home and then they got home

226
00:26:57.92 --> 00:27:02.24
and one of the guys a good friend of mine and he came and worked with me in the training department

227
00:27:02.24 --> 00:27:08.48
and you know, we would have that conversation a couple times where, you know, Mikey Montsore got

228
00:27:08.48 --> 00:27:15.68
killed, you know, September 29th and those guys were now coming on deployment a week, maybe two weeks

229
00:27:15.68 --> 00:27:21.36
later to come over and start getting a turnover from us. We went home October 21st. So, you know,

230
00:27:21.36 --> 00:27:26.80
when I talked to my buddy that was the senior listed guy, you know, he, he, I said, man, what was

231
00:27:26.80 --> 00:27:33.20
that like? And he goes, we were training so hard. You know, there's no, they were just a hundred

232
00:27:33.20 --> 00:27:37.60
a thousand percent training because we'd send him back, hey, make sure you're in good shape,

233
00:27:37.60 --> 00:27:40.32
make sure you can run, make sure you can do body carries, make sure you, because they're

234
00:27:40.32 --> 00:27:44.40
running on the beach, you can do a buddy carries all the time. They were training so hard because

235
00:27:44.40 --> 00:27:48.80
they're thinking of themselves, you know, this is it. This is going to be a different kind of

236
00:27:48.80 --> 00:27:53.76
deployment. And we're actually going to probably have one of those guys from that follow-in

237
00:27:53.76 --> 00:27:59.20
deployment on the podcast, who's a stud. So, we'll get him on here in the near future.

238
00:28:02.32 --> 00:28:09.68
All right. Going back to the book, the discipline of the Greeks was secured by exercises and

239
00:28:09.68 --> 00:28:16.56
rewards. The discipline of the Romans was secured also by the fear of death. They put to death

240
00:28:16.56 --> 00:28:22.48
with the club. They decimated their cowardly or traitorous units. They clubbed them to death, clubbed

241
00:28:22.48 --> 00:28:30.32
them to death. In order to conquer enemies that terrified his men, a Roman general heightened their

242
00:28:30.32 --> 00:28:39.60
morale, not by enthusiasm, but by anger. He made the life of his soldiers miserable by excessive

243
00:28:39.60 --> 00:28:46.64
work and privations. He stretched the force of discipline to the point where at a critical incident,

244
00:28:46.64 --> 00:28:56.64
instant, it must break or expend itself on the enemy. That's that's that's crazy. And it's actually

245
00:28:56.64 --> 00:29:02.16
there's a great little clip on YouTube of a Marine. I think it's I think it's a sergeant major in

246
00:29:02.16 --> 00:29:07.36
Rekorbe. He's given a little talk to his boys before they roll out. And he's just he's awesome.

247
00:29:07.36 --> 00:29:11.36
And he's saying, why do you think we don't feed you good? We want you to be pissed off. We want you to be

248
00:29:11.36 --> 00:29:15.84
pissed off. You got there kicked their ass. That's what they're this is saying. Only, you know, the

249
00:29:15.84 --> 00:29:22.64
Marine is being somewhat facetious and playful about it. This guy's not. They made life hard for these

250
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:26.56
guys. And again, you can see that even that's it. There's a line. There's a dichotomy like you could

251
00:29:26.56 --> 00:29:30.24
go too far. Now you're going to get some kind of rebellion. You get it where it's either going to break

252
00:29:30.24 --> 00:29:35.76
the guys or if you do it perfect, they'll take that rage and they'll use it against the enemy.

253
00:29:35.76 --> 00:29:40.80
Yeah, kind of like they do with dogs. Yeah, like if you have seen fighting dogs, yeah, for sure. They do that.

254
00:29:44.64 --> 00:29:49.04
Back to the book, but discipline alone does not constitute superior tactics.

255
00:29:49.92 --> 00:29:57.36
Men in battle, I repeat, is a being in whom the instinct of self preservation dominates, even at

256
00:29:57.36 --> 00:30:05.12
certain moments, all other sentiments. Discipline has for its aim, the domination of that instinct

257
00:30:05.12 --> 00:30:12.000
to buy a greater terror. Okay, so you got, you're going to be scared. Discipline, the goal of discipline

258
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.16
is to shut down and dominate that fear instinct. Back to the book, but it cannot dominate it completely.

259
00:30:20.16 --> 00:30:27.28
I do not deny the glorious examples where discipline and devotion have elevated man above himself.

260
00:30:27.28 --> 00:30:37.36
But if these examples are glorious, it is because they are rare. If they are admired, it is because

261
00:30:37.36 --> 00:30:43.60
they are considered exceptions and the exception proves the rule. So obviously, we have heroes.

262
00:30:43.60 --> 00:30:53.76
I have guys, I my tasked it, were that level of heroes that overcame every instinct of self discipline

263
00:30:53.76 --> 00:31:02.40
or of self preservation to do their job. Back to the book, the determination of that

264
00:31:02.40 --> 00:31:10.000
instinct, where man loses his reasoning power and becomes instinctive is the crowning achievement

265
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.36
in the science of combat. So what he's saying, there is understanding that what that where that

266
00:31:15.36 --> 00:31:20.24
line is with people is the crowning achievement. If you know that, if you know where that line is,

267
00:31:20.24 --> 00:31:25.52
that's the crowning achievement. In the back of the book, in general, here was the strength of the

268
00:31:25.52 --> 00:31:32.56
Roman tactics. In particular cases, such successful determination makes handables and

269
00:31:32.56 --> 00:31:41.76
seizures. They understood their men. Combat took place between masses in more or less

270
00:31:41.76 --> 00:31:47.12
formate deep formation, commanded and supervised by leaders with a definite mission.

271
00:31:47.12 --> 00:31:52.56
Leaders understood the mission. The combat between masses was a series of individual

272
00:31:52.56 --> 00:32:00.80
conflicts juxtaposed with the front rank man fighting a love. If he fell, if he was wounded or

273
00:32:00.80 --> 00:32:06.56
worn out, he was replaced by the man in the second rank who had watched and guarded his flanks.

274
00:32:07.52 --> 00:32:13.76
This procedure continued up to the last rank. Man is always physically and morally

275
00:32:13.76 --> 00:32:19.76
fatigued in hand to hand tournament where he employees all of his energy. These contests lasted

276
00:32:19.76 --> 00:32:27.60
but a short time. With morale, with like morale, the least fatigued always win. So

277
00:32:28.56 --> 00:32:32.64
conditioning, literally we're talking about combat conditioning right there. That's what we're talking

278
00:32:32.64 --> 00:32:38.88
about. During this engagement of the first two ranks, the one fighting the other watching

279
00:32:38.88 --> 00:32:45.28
close at hand, the men of the near ranks waited inactive at two paces distance for their

280
00:32:45.28 --> 00:32:50.88
turning combat. So imagine this echo, I'm in the front and you're behind me, two paces,

281
00:32:50.88 --> 00:32:55.36
and you're gonna watch me fight. So that's what he's talking about right here.

282
00:32:59.04 --> 00:33:05.20
At two paces for their turning combat, which would come only when their predecessor were killed,

283
00:33:05.20 --> 00:33:13.84
wounded or exhausted, they were impressed by the violent fluctuations of the struggle of the first rank.

284
00:33:13.84 --> 00:33:19.20
They heard the clashes and the blows and distinguished perhaps those that sank into the flesh.

285
00:33:20.64 --> 00:33:25.44
They saw the wounded, the exhausted crawl through the intervals to go to the rear.

286
00:33:26.64 --> 00:33:32.16
Passive spectators of danger, they were forced to await its terrible approach.

287
00:33:32.16 --> 00:33:38.88
These men were subjected to the poignant emotions of combat without being supported by the

288
00:33:38.88 --> 00:33:46.56
animation of the struggle. They were thus placed under moral pressure of the greatest of anxieties.

289
00:33:47.68 --> 00:33:54.56
Often they could not stand it until their turn came. They gave way. So that's just a crazy way to

290
00:33:54.56 --> 00:33:59.44
think about combat. You're standing behind me, I'm fighting, I get clubbed in the head, they stabbed

291
00:33:59.44 --> 00:34:05.20
me in the chest, I'm dead. And actually, that didn't happen fast, let's say it took two minutes.

292
00:34:05.20 --> 00:34:09.84
You're standing there watching me, you're like, oh, go, hey, and then also get killed.

293
00:34:09.84 --> 00:34:15.84
Then I'm up. And then you're up. Yeah, that's when he says like the most anxiety.

294
00:34:15.84 --> 00:34:22.24
Yeah, the most imagine you're four guys back. Well, yeah, you're four guys back. And I can totally

295
00:34:22.24 --> 00:34:29.68
confirm this in combat. The time when you're waiting to go is the worst. Like we get to a

296
00:34:29.68 --> 00:34:33.68
pre staging point and now you're waiting to go, okay, you've got all the stuff going through your

297
00:34:33.68 --> 00:34:36.48
mind, what if this happens, what if this happens, what if this guys moves, what if they do this,

298
00:34:36.48 --> 00:34:39.84
you've got all this turmoil going in your mind. And you're not even, they're not talking about

299
00:34:39.84 --> 00:34:45.36
this situation where you're watching your guy get stabbed in the throat, right? And just standing there

300
00:34:45.36 --> 00:34:50.000
watching it waiting for him to go down so you can step up and by the way, you know, like you know

301
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.28
me. And so if you see me get crushed and but when we train, I'm crushing you. You know, you're

302
00:34:55.28 --> 00:35:01.12
laughing. Yeah, right? Because you know, a jocco, he's good with the sword. Oh, he's got stabbed

303
00:35:01.12 --> 00:35:06.72
neck. Now I got to take his place against Billy Badass, my enemy. And I don't say the chance.

304
00:35:07.44 --> 00:35:10.48
Yeah, that's right. So that's why you say it a lot of these, a lot of times these people turned

305
00:35:10.48 --> 00:35:15.84
and gave way. So this is a little bit different. Listen to this. Back to the book,

306
00:35:15.84 --> 00:35:22.08
the best tactics were those that made easiest a succession of efforts by assuring the relief

307
00:35:22.08 --> 00:35:29.28
by ranks of unit in action, actually engaging only the necessary units and keeping the rest as

308
00:35:29.28 --> 00:35:37.52
support or reserve outside of the immediate sphere of moral tension. So don't put those guys right there

309
00:35:37.52 --> 00:35:42.32
where they can see all the stuff going on. Back to the book, the superiority of the Romans lay in

310
00:35:42.32 --> 00:35:48.56
such tactics and in the terrible discipline which prepared and assured the execution by their resistance

311
00:35:48.56 --> 00:35:55.20
against fatigue, which rude and continually continual tasks gave them and by the renewal of

312
00:35:55.20 --> 00:36:01.92
combatants in combat, they secured continuity of effort greater than anyone else. So did you notice

313
00:36:01.92 --> 00:36:06.72
this part, their resistance against fatigue came from rude and continual tasks. So these guys

314
00:36:06.72 --> 00:36:13.12
were just getting ground all the time. Basically they lived a hard life working or basic work and

315
00:36:13.12 --> 00:36:19.04
out. I'm sure it was wouldn't be what we consider like a Metcon, but they were hard. And because

316
00:36:19.04 --> 00:36:24.08
they were tough and they were hard, they're physically stronger and more physically conditioned.

317
00:36:24.08 --> 00:36:30.32
They did better. And you know, Dan Gable, I think I forget the exact quote, but you know,

318
00:36:30.32 --> 00:36:36.08
the great American wrestler, Dan Gable, conditioning is the ultimate equalizer. If you get time,

319
00:36:36.08 --> 00:36:40.80
you feel listen to you all the time. You someone gets tired or MMA, someone gets tired. It's game over.

320
00:36:40.80 --> 00:36:47.44
It's game over. You can, I can crush anybody when they're tired. You give me, you give me

321
00:36:47.44 --> 00:36:54.64
anybody and you force them to do 100 burpees and 75 kettlebell swings and you know, as fast as they can

322
00:36:54.64 --> 00:37:03.20
and let me in the ring with them. I'll get anybody. Because they already got worn out. So

323
00:37:03.20 --> 00:37:13.44
this is actually, this is, like I said, he does a lot of, I didn't go into a lot of these,

324
00:37:14.72 --> 00:37:26.32
but this is Caesar's account of a battle against the Pompeians and at the battle of

325
00:37:26.32 --> 00:37:32.80
Farsalas. So I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's pretty, there's some pretty cool points in here.

326
00:37:32.80 --> 00:37:38.08
Again, it's pretty cool that, you know, I like first person accounts of things, right? Let's get

327
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:44.16
a first person account from Caesar up in here. And what's cool, well, he writes, he refers to himself

328
00:37:44.16 --> 00:37:48.24
in the third person for whatever reason. I'm sure there's some reason for that, but that's what he does.

329
00:37:49.04 --> 00:37:54.96
Here we go. Caesar, in the meanwhile, our soldiers at the given signal advanced with

330
00:37:54.96 --> 00:38:01.68
javelins in hand, but having noticed that that Pompey's soldiers were not running towards them

331
00:38:02.08 --> 00:38:08.32
and taught by experience and trained by previous battles, they slowed down and stopped in the midst of

332
00:38:08.32 --> 00:38:14.64
the run in order not to arrive out of breath and worn out. That's pretty legit. They're like,

333
00:38:14.64 --> 00:38:18.24
these guys aren't running towards us. We don't need to run towards them. Save our breath.

334
00:38:19.04 --> 00:38:23.84
Some moments after having taken up their run again, they launched their javelins and immediately

335
00:38:23.84 --> 00:38:29.12
afterwards, according to Caesar's order, drew their swords. The Pompeyans conducted themselves

336
00:38:29.12 --> 00:38:33.84
perfectly little compliments to the enemy. They received the darts courageously, they did not

337
00:38:33.84 --> 00:38:39.84
stir before the dash of the legions, they preserved their lines and having dispatched their javelins

338
00:38:39.84 --> 00:38:46.80
drew their swords. At the same time, Pompey's entire cavalry dashed from the left wing as had been

339
00:38:46.80 --> 00:38:52.56
ordered and the mass of his archers ran from all parts of the line. Our cavalry did not await

340
00:38:52.56 --> 00:38:58.40
the charge, but fell back a little. Pompey's cavalry became more pressing and commenced to reform

341
00:38:58.40 --> 00:39:06.48
its quadrants and turn our exposed flank. As soon as Caesar saw this intention, he gave the

342
00:39:06.48 --> 00:39:13.92
signal to the fourth line of six cohorts. This line started directly and standards low. They charged

343
00:39:13.92 --> 00:39:20.08
the Pompey and cavalry with such vigor and resolution that not a single man stood his ground.

344
00:39:20.08 --> 00:39:26.88
All wheeled about this would happen when you flank people. All wheeled about and not only with

345
00:39:26.88 --> 00:39:32.32
Jew and full flight, but gained the highest mountains as fast as they could. They left the

346
00:39:32.32 --> 00:39:40.40
archers and slingers without their defense and protection. These were all killed. At the same time,

347
00:39:40.40 --> 00:39:45.76
the cohorts moved to the rear of Pompey's left wing, which was still fighting and resisting and

348
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:53.60
attacked it in rear. Meanwhile, Caesar had advanced his third line, which up to this moment had

349
00:39:53.60 --> 00:39:59.76
been quietly kept quietly at its post. These fresh troops relieved those that were fatigued.

350
00:39:59.76 --> 00:40:05.12
Pompey's men taken in rear could no longer hold out and all took to flight.

351
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.88
Caesar was not in error when he put these cohorts in a fourth line, particularly charged with

352
00:40:10.88 --> 00:40:16.000
meeting the cavalry and urged them to do well since their effort would bring victory. They

353
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.72
repulse the cavalry. They cut to pieces the slingers and arches. They turned Pompey's left wing

354
00:40:22.72 --> 00:40:31.44
and this decided the day. Caesar lost in this battle 200 soldiers, but nearly 30 of the brave

355
00:40:31.44 --> 00:40:40.80
centurions were killed therein. Of Pompey's army of 15,000 perished, and more than 24,000 took refuge

356
00:40:40.80 --> 00:40:47.04
in the mountains as Caesar had invested in the mountains with entrenchment. They surrendered the

357
00:40:47.04 --> 00:40:54.88
following day. That's one of the things that DuPique points out. He does a lot of comparisons and we'll

358
00:40:54.88 --> 00:40:59.92
get to some of them in the differences between ancient combat and modern combat and one of the big

359
00:40:59.92 --> 00:41:07.44
things that he points out is in ancient combat. The winner would take very, very small amounts of

360
00:41:07.44 --> 00:41:14.88
casualties and the loser would be exterminated in many cases. And what's different about modern

361
00:41:14.88 --> 00:41:23.84
battle, world war two, world war one, the victor and the loser. They're both going to take

362
00:41:23.84 --> 00:41:28.24
really bad casualties. In fact, sometimes they take almost the same amount of casualties. In fact,

363
00:41:28.24 --> 00:41:34.56
sometimes the loser of the battle takes less casualties or takes more casualties. The winner

364
00:41:34.56 --> 00:41:39.76
takes more casualties, but they had more people. They had better maneuverability. They dropped

365
00:41:39.76 --> 00:41:46.40
bombs or whatever. So that's a really different thing. And that gets into the mental state because

366
00:41:47.44 --> 00:41:53.92
think about if you, if you and I were fighting in a battle. Sure. And we knew that if we lost,

367
00:41:53.92 --> 00:41:59.68
we would die. You're going to fight harder. You're going to be more aggressive. And when and

368
00:42:01.04 --> 00:42:04.96
if the battle started to turn, you were going to run to try and save yourself.

369
00:42:06.80 --> 00:42:12.40
Whereas in modern warfare, we take prisoners, you can survive and you can live the fight another

370
00:42:12.40 --> 00:42:16.88
day. So you know what, hey, we're starting, I'm just going to surrender, but give up on the, you know,

371
00:42:16.88 --> 00:42:18.96
you're not going to fight with that same kind of bigger.

372
00:42:18.96 --> 00:42:28.16
Now, there's a comment in here. The order to await the charge given by Pompeii to his infantry

373
00:42:28.16 --> 00:42:35.36
was judged to severely by Caesar. Caesar certainly was right as a general rule. The enthusiasm of the

374
00:42:35.36 --> 00:42:41.76
troops must not be dampened. And the initiative of the attack indeed gives to the assailant

375
00:42:41.76 --> 00:42:51.60
a certain moral influence. So clearly, if your boys, your team is aggressively getting after it,

376
00:42:52.40 --> 00:42:56.48
it's not a good idea to pull the reins on them. They got the momentum. They're going,

377
00:42:56.48 --> 00:42:59.92
they're fired up, let them go, let them rock and roll. Obviously, you don't want to let them run to your

378
00:42:59.92 --> 00:43:04.88
death, but you want to maintain that momentum to the best of your ability.

379
00:43:04.88 --> 00:43:06.88
Mm.

380
00:43:11.28 --> 00:43:16.16
Now talking a little bit about morale in ancient battle. This is some of the stuff again that I,

381
00:43:16.16 --> 00:43:22.80
I, I've been saying back to the book. It was customary among good troops to have a clash,

382
00:43:22.80 --> 00:43:29.12
but not the blind and headlong onset of the mass. The preoccupation of the rank was very great.

383
00:43:29.12 --> 00:43:36.56
As the behavior of Caesar troops at Farla, Farcales shows in their slow march. At the moment

384
00:43:36.56 --> 00:43:41.52
of getting close to the enemy, the dash slacking to of its own accord, because the men of the

385
00:43:41.52 --> 00:43:47.36
first rank of necessity and instinctively assured themselves of the position of their supports,

386
00:43:47.36 --> 00:43:52.48
their neighbors in the same line, their comrades in the second, and collected themselves together

387
00:43:52.48 --> 00:43:58.08
in order to be more the masters of their movement and strike and strike and parry. So that,

388
00:43:58.08 --> 00:44:02.32
that's not an order that was given. Those guys instinctively, they're getting close to the enemy,

389
00:44:02.32 --> 00:44:05.28
they slow down, they check their flanks, they check that they're good to go, they check that their

390
00:44:05.28 --> 00:44:09.28
buddies are behind them, now we're going to go forward, because, and I think that's important because

391
00:44:09.28 --> 00:44:14.80
it says, in order to be more masters of their movements, they're slowing down so they're ready.

392
00:44:15.84 --> 00:44:22.64
Back to the book, there was a contact of man with man. Each took the adversary in front of him and

393
00:44:22.64 --> 00:44:28.64
attacked him because by penetrating into the ranks before having struck him down, he risked being wounded

394
00:44:28.64 --> 00:44:34.16
in the side by losing his flanks' support. So these guys tried to stay in ranks, because even if

395
00:44:34.48 --> 00:44:39.04
even if I'm going against you and I chop you down, if I now step into your ranks, now I'm exposed.

396
00:44:39.04 --> 00:44:43.36
My flanks were exposed, so I can't do that. We got to stay online. This is something we still

397
00:44:43.36 --> 00:44:49.68
do in the military today. We got to stay online. Each one then hit his man with his shield,

398
00:44:49.68 --> 00:44:55.68
expecting to make him lose his equilibrium and at the end, and at the instant he tried to recover

399
00:44:55.68 --> 00:45:03.92
himself landed the blow. The men in the second line, back of the intervals necessary for fencing

400
00:45:03.92 --> 00:45:08.72
in the first were ready to protect their sides against anyone that advanced between them and were

401
00:45:08.72 --> 00:45:13.52
prepared to relieve tired warriors. There's the same in the third line, so that's what we already

402
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:18.72
talked about. By the way, this is a cover and move. This is ancient cover and move. If I need some help,

403
00:45:18.72 --> 00:45:22.24
you're going to be right there to cover for me. If I'm fighting guy in front of me, you're

404
00:45:22.24 --> 00:45:27.04
covering my flanks. That's where it is. It's ancient cover and move. Back to the book. Everyone being

405
00:45:27.04 --> 00:45:33.28
supported on the other side. The first encounter was rarely decisive and defencing the real combat

406
00:45:33.28 --> 00:45:40.40
at close quarters began. So after that initial, now is when we get, now is where it gets gritty.

407
00:45:40.72 --> 00:45:45.44
If the men of the first line were wounded quickly, if the other ranks were not in a hurry to

408
00:45:45.44 --> 00:45:51.20
relieve or replace them, or if there was hesitation, defeat followed. This happened to the Romans

409
00:45:51.20 --> 00:45:57.52
in their first encounter with the Gauls. The Gaul, with his shield, parried the first thrust,

410
00:45:57.52 --> 00:46:04.96
brought his big iron sword swooping down with fury upon the top of the Roman shield, split it

411
00:46:04.96 --> 00:46:13.68
and went after the man. So the Gauls had some big swords, big guys, and they figured out a little

412
00:46:13.68 --> 00:46:18.32
tactic technique in procedure. Oh, you got that little round shield. Cool. I'm going to hack it right

413
00:46:18.32 --> 00:46:24.48
in half and that's what they did. The Romans already hesitating before the more impulse of the Gauls

414
00:46:25.36 --> 00:46:30.96
the Gauls, their ferocious yells. So this is the Gauls, their ferocious yells, their newdness

415
00:46:30.96 --> 00:46:38.32
and indication of a contempt for wounds. So the guy that you're fighting is naked or like not wearing

416
00:46:38.32 --> 00:46:45.36
armor, which says, oh, I'm ready to bring it. The you want to beat me in a street fight, be naked.

417
00:46:45.36 --> 00:46:51.92
I'm not going to fight you. I'm not not not happening. Fell then in greater number than their

418
00:46:51.92 --> 00:46:58.96
adversaries and do demoralization followed. Soon, they accustomed themselves to this

419
00:46:58.96 --> 00:47:04.56
valorous but not tenacious spirit of their enemies. And this is pretty cool. Back to book when they

420
00:47:04.56 --> 00:47:10.88
had protected the tops of their shields with an iron band. They no longer fell and the rolls were

421
00:47:10.88 --> 00:47:14.72
changed so they made a little adaptation. Oh, you're going to hack the top of our shields cool

422
00:47:14.72 --> 00:47:26.24
of an iron band in there. What he got now, Gaul. Bring it. If the weapons were nearly alike

423
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:30.96
preserving ranks and thereby breaking down, driving back and confusing the ranks the enemy

424
00:47:30.96 --> 00:47:39.92
was to conquer. The man in disordered broken lines no longer felt himself supported but vulnerable

425
00:47:39.92 --> 00:47:46.000
everywhere and he fled. Think about that psychology. So as you start seeing the blinds breaking

426
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.60
down, you don't feel like you're getting supported anymore, boom, I'm out. It is true that it's

427
00:47:51.60 --> 00:47:57.36
hardly possible to break hostile lines without doing the same with one's own. But the one who

428
00:47:57.36 --> 00:48:03.68
breaks through first has been able to do so only by making the foe fall back before his blows

429
00:48:03.68 --> 00:48:08.80
or by killing or wounding. He is thereby raised his courage and that of his neighbor.

430
00:48:11.12 --> 00:48:18.56
Common sense. If I see my buddy take that guy out, I'm getting more fired up. He knows

431
00:48:18.56 --> 00:48:23.92
he sees where he is marching whilst the adversary overtaken as a consequent of the retreat or the

432
00:48:23.92 --> 00:48:29.04
fall of troops that were flanking him, he's surprised. This is just Giz just group mentality,

433
00:48:29.04 --> 00:48:34.64
gang mentality. Is that right group thought? Group think. I start seeing my guys get crushed. I'll

434
00:48:34.64 --> 00:48:41.36
be to get scared. He sees himself exposed on the flank. He falls back on a line with their rank

435
00:48:41.36 --> 00:48:47.12
in the rear in order to regain support. But the lines in the rear give way to retreat to the

436
00:48:47.12 --> 00:48:53.28
retreat of the first. If the withdrawal has a certain duration, terror comes as a result of the

437
00:48:53.28 --> 00:49:00.40
blows which drive back and mowed down the first line. If to make room for those pushed back,

438
00:49:00.40 --> 00:49:05.28
the last lines turn their backs. There's small chance that they will face the front again.

439
00:49:06.24 --> 00:49:14.16
Space has tempted them. They will not return to fight. Then by that natural instinct of the soldier

440
00:49:14.16 --> 00:49:20.000
to worry to assure himself of his supports, the contagion of flight spreads from the last ranks

441
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.24
to the first. The first closely engaged has been held to the fight in the meantime under the pain

442
00:49:26.24 --> 00:49:33.76
of immediate death. There is no need to explain what follows. It is butchery.

443
00:49:39.68 --> 00:49:45.44
You can see how important it would be to understand those dynamics of what's going to happen

444
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:51.04
into a ply your tactics and a manner that as they said in the as Dupique says in the beginning,

445
00:49:51.04 --> 00:49:57.04
you look apply your tactics or formulate your tactics with that understanding of human nature.

446
00:49:59.52 --> 00:50:04.80
Little interesting note here. Sword Dessord combat was the most deadly. They presented the most

447
00:50:04.80 --> 00:50:10.88
sudden changes because it was the one in which the individual valor and dexterity of the combat

448
00:50:10.88 --> 00:50:19.28
had the greatest and most immediate influence. That sword fighting is what takes the most skill.

449
00:50:19.28 --> 00:50:24.16
So I assume that means if I've got a javelin or if I've got a spear it takes less skill. You get

450
00:50:24.16 --> 00:50:29.28
man on man with the sword. That's where things count. That's where your skill level counts the most.

451
00:50:29.28 --> 00:50:37.52
You can maneuver more with it. I'll be clubbed. I hope I can land it. We know from doing

452
00:50:37.52 --> 00:50:42.64
geetsu that you can get really good. And if you go anybody that does geetsu goes against someone

453
00:50:42.64 --> 00:50:48.48
that doesn't do geetsu, they annihilate him. So imagine the training that you do with the sword when you

454
00:50:48.48 --> 00:50:58.72
knew that how much it was going on and just healing guys. Back to the book. Man always has had

455
00:50:58.72 --> 00:51:04.40
the greatest fear of being trampled upon by horses. This is a section talking about cavalry.

456
00:51:04.40 --> 00:51:11.68
That fear has certainly routed a hundred thousand times more men than the real encounter.

457
00:51:11.68 --> 00:51:15.44
So the reason I put that in there is because the geetsu saying hey people are scared of horses.

458
00:51:15.44 --> 00:51:19.60
They're scared of getting trampled by horses. And that fear of horses has done more to win battles

459
00:51:19.60 --> 00:51:27.36
than to the actual horses. You know we did some, you know for us the US military,

460
00:51:28.08 --> 00:51:33.60
we're going against a gnarly enemy. We can put the fear into them too. We have closer support

461
00:51:33.60 --> 00:51:39.68
coming in and start dropping bombs or even flying over. We did, we would have, you know if we didn't

462
00:51:39.68 --> 00:51:45.20
have a specific target but we knew bad guys were around. We would shoot like fields. Start dropping

463
00:51:45.20 --> 00:51:52.16
bombs and fields. If like deterrent fires. Hey get these guys. Hey put us in deterrent. There's a

464
00:51:52.16 --> 00:51:56.64
field over here. Yes we got no friendly in that area. Do you see anything? No drop some bombs in there.

465
00:51:57.36 --> 00:52:03.28
Send some shock waves on these bad guys. Same thing. You're scared of the horses. You're scared

466
00:52:03.28 --> 00:52:15.60
of a AC 130 or an A10 coming down and getting after it or a cobra gunship or an Apache. Yeah those

467
00:52:15.60 --> 00:52:20.80
things are fearsome machines of death. And when the enemy knows those things are around they're

468
00:52:20.80 --> 00:52:27.52
going to run. They're going to hide. Can't always run or hide from a person from a Apache or a US gunship.

469
00:52:27.52 --> 00:52:33.44
All right back to the book. If we have spoken especially of the infantry fight is because

470
00:52:33.44 --> 00:52:39.12
it was the most serious on foot, on horseback, on the bridge of a vessel at the moment of

471
00:52:39.12 --> 00:52:43.68
dayager, the same man has always found. So he's saying like we're talking about infantry and we just

472
00:52:43.68 --> 00:52:48.32
talked a little bit about horses but it doesn't matter what the fighting situation is. The same

473
00:52:48.32 --> 00:52:55.36
man has always found. Anyone who knows him well reduces from his action in the past what his action

474
00:52:55.36 --> 00:53:11.84
will be in the future. So understand that human nature. And here we start talking about again it's

475
00:53:11.84 --> 00:53:17.52
this same theme. Back to the book. Let us repeat now what we've said at the very beginning of this

476
00:53:17.52 --> 00:53:23.84
study. Man does not enter battle to fight but for victory. He does everything he can to avoid

477
00:53:23.84 --> 00:53:29.92
the first and obtain the second. The continued improvement of all appliances of war has no other

478
00:53:29.92 --> 00:53:36.88
goal than the annihilation of the enemy. Absolute bravery which does not refuse battle even on

479
00:53:36.88 --> 00:53:45.76
unequal terms trusting only to God or destiny is not natural in man. It is the result of moral

480
00:53:45.76 --> 00:53:51.44
culture. So that's that's pretty that's pretty poignant, right? Because I've seen some absolute

481
00:53:51.44 --> 00:53:59.92
bravery and there's thousands of individual stories of absolute bravery in our culture, in our

482
00:53:59.92 --> 00:54:06.64
US culture and that's because of our moral culture that's where it comes from. Back to the book

483
00:54:06.64 --> 00:54:12.40
it is infinitely rare because in the face of danger the animal case of self preservation always gains

484
00:54:12.40 --> 00:54:21.84
the upper hand. Man has a horror of death. In the bravest a great sense of duty which they alone are

485
00:54:21.84 --> 00:54:28.96
capable of understanding and living up to is paramount. But the mass always cowers at the site of the

486
00:54:28.96 --> 00:54:40.32
phantom death. Discipline is for the purpose of dominating that horror by still greater horror, that of punishment,

487
00:54:40.32 --> 00:54:50.72
or disgrace. So he's talking about you know what and Tony said this and this is a common

488
00:54:50.72 --> 00:54:56.32
team guy thing to say you know I would rather die than look like a pussy and it's like oh yeah

489
00:54:56.32 --> 00:55:03.60
ha ha no actually it's true that's that's an actual feeling it's an actual thought for sure

490
00:55:05.60 --> 00:55:09.36
and that's what he's saying people would rather die than be disgraced and that's powerful

491
00:55:10.48 --> 00:55:16.32
but there always comes an instant when natural horror gets the upper hand over discipline and the

492
00:55:16.32 --> 00:55:22.88
fighter flees. Stop stop hold out a few minutes and instant more and you are the victor you are not

493
00:55:22.88 --> 00:55:31.44
even wounded if you turn your back you are dead. He does not hear he cannot hear anymore he is full of fear.

494
00:55:31.44 --> 00:55:37.84
How many armies have sworn to conquer or perish? How many have kept their oaths?

495
00:55:38.80 --> 00:55:48.32
An oath of sheep to stand up against wolves. History shows not armies but firm souls who have

496
00:55:48.32 --> 00:55:57.44
fought unto death and the devotion of thermopoli is therefore justly immortal so the Spartans

497
00:55:57.44 --> 00:56:04.64
the 300 Spartans there's a reason why that is any immortal story because it's rare and it's not a

498
00:56:04.64 --> 00:56:12.16
whole army it's 300 Spartans and obviously we've seen examples of guys doing the same kind of thing

499
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:23.68
but that's why they're heroes. To ensure success in the rude test of conflict it is not

500
00:56:23.68 --> 00:56:32.32
sufficient to have a mass composed of valiant men the mass needs and we give it leaders who have

501
00:56:32.32 --> 00:56:37.04
firmness and decision of command proceeding from habit and an entire faith in their unquestimal

502
00:56:37.04 --> 00:56:43.52
right to command as established by tradition law and society. So step number one you need good leadership

503
00:56:44.64 --> 00:56:49.60
step number one you need good leadership. Bunch of valiant men is not going to be enough you need

504
00:56:49.60 --> 00:56:56.000
good leadership step number one. Step number two we add good arms we add methods of fighting

505
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.24
suitable to these arms and those of the enemy and which do not overtax the physical and moral

506
00:57:02.24 --> 00:57:09.12
forces of man so you gotta give them good weapons and the weapons have gotta be easy to use

507
00:57:09.12 --> 00:57:16.16
and suitable for the enemy that you're going against. Next we add also a rational decentralization

508
00:57:16.56 --> 00:57:23.60
that permits the direction and employment of the efforts of all even to the last man so we have

509
00:57:23.60 --> 00:57:31.68
decentralized command. I believe life and I wrote about that. Yep it's one of the fundamental principles

510
00:57:31.68 --> 00:57:40.24
of combat leadership. Next we animate with passion a violent desire for independence, a religious

511
00:57:40.24 --> 00:57:48.08
fanaticism, a rational pride, a love of glory, a madness for possession and iron discipline which

512
00:57:48.08 --> 00:57:55.60
permits no one to escape action secures the greatest unity from top to bottom between all elements

513
00:57:55.60 --> 00:57:59.52
between the commanding officers between the commanding officers and the man in between the soldiers.

514
00:57:59.52 --> 00:58:05.20
So those are a series of things that you can have that can fuel this right. A passion, a

515
00:58:05.20 --> 00:58:09.60
violent desire for independence, religious fanaticism, these are things that people fight for,

516
00:58:09.60 --> 00:58:15.60
a national pride, a love of glory, a madness for possession, think about that. You need what

517
00:58:15.60 --> 00:58:26.48
of those elements. Have we then a solid army? Not yet. Unity, the first and supreme force of

518
00:58:26.48 --> 00:58:32.000
armies is sought by enacting severe laws of discipline supported by powerful passions.

519
00:58:32.88 --> 00:58:39.60
But to order discipline is not enough, a vigilance from which no one may escape and combat

520
00:58:39.60 --> 00:58:45.28
should assure the maintenance of discipline. Discipline itself depends on moral pressure

521
00:58:45.28 --> 00:58:54.80
which activates men to advance from sentiments of fear or pride. But it depends also on surveillance

522
00:58:54.80 --> 00:59:01.68
the mutual supervision of groups of men who know each other well. You've got to have relationships.

523
00:59:01.68 --> 00:59:06.40
You've got a relationship and then the relationship has to have inherent in it. This attitude of like

524
00:59:06.40 --> 00:59:11.20
echo, if I see you slacking, I'm going to call you out on it. Hey bro, we don't do that here.

525
00:59:11.92 --> 00:59:18.08
That's not how we roll. You need to get your game on. And that's to get this mutual supervision of each other.

526
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:27.60
Based on pride. Back to the book, a wise organization ensures that the personnel of combat

527
00:59:27.60 --> 00:59:32.64
groups changes as little as possible so that comrades and peacetime maneuvers shall be comrades and

528
00:59:32.64 --> 00:59:39.28
war from living together and obeying the same chiefs, from commanding the same men, from sharing

529
00:59:39.28 --> 00:59:45.44
fatigue and rest, from cooperation among men who quickly understand each other in the execution of

530
00:59:45.44 --> 00:59:54.08
warlike movements may be bread, brotherhood, professional knowledge, sentiment and above all unity.

531
00:59:56.64 --> 01:00:03.20
So what are we talking about there? You're building this strong bond between the people that are

532
01:00:03.20 --> 01:00:07.76
inside this unit. That's what you want to do and how do you do it? You're a trainem hard. They live

533
01:00:07.76 --> 01:00:12.40
together. They work together. They listen to the same boss. They command the same people. That's what

534
01:00:12.40 --> 01:00:18.56
you do. And that's when you look at military units, that's what makes them good. You go through that.

535
01:00:18.56 --> 01:00:22.40
You go through that hard training. You get to know your people. You build those relationships.

536
01:00:24.48 --> 01:00:28.96
The duty of obedience, the right of imposing discipline and the impossibility of escaping from it

537
01:00:28.96 --> 01:00:35.92
would naturally follow. And now confidence appears. And you know what this sounds like? It sounds like a gang.

538
01:00:35.92 --> 01:00:44.56
And I often said about task unit, bruiser, that I was in charge of a gang. Awesome gang.

539
01:00:44.56 --> 01:00:49.44
I've been an awesome gang. I did good things for the world, but they were a gang.

540
01:00:49.44 --> 01:00:55.76
Gang mentality for sure. You didn't want to, you didn't want to get called out by the gang.

541
01:00:55.76 --> 01:01:00.000
You just didn't want that to happen. When someone was messing up, when someone was doing the wrong

542
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.04
thing, someone's cutting corners, task unit bruiser wasn't going to be, they were going to be on you.

543
01:01:05.04 --> 01:01:09.84
It would be on you. I never had to say anything. Guys, we're driving, we barely see it.

544
01:01:09.84 --> 01:01:13.04
But I'd hear about it as kind of a snoozing. We tighten them up.

545
01:01:13.04 --> 01:01:20.08
Oh, yeah, I'd get to go. Good to go. Back to the book. Then we have an army.

546
01:01:20.72 --> 01:01:25.84
And there's no longer difficult to explain how men carry away by passions, even men who know

547
01:01:25.84 --> 01:01:32.24
how to die without flinching, without turning pale, really strong in the presence of death,

548
01:01:32.24 --> 01:01:39.20
but without discipline, without solid organization, are vanquished by others,

549
01:01:39.20 --> 01:01:46.48
individually less valiant, but firmly, jointly, and severely combined.

550
01:01:49.84 --> 01:01:55.04
So, you know what you see this in the business world? You see this in the business world where

551
01:01:55.68 --> 01:01:59.68
where you meet people in the business world that are really passionate about what they're doing.

552
01:01:59.68 --> 01:02:05.20
They're really passionate. They're really into it. They've created something. They're really

553
01:02:05.20 --> 01:02:09.12
into it. They want to succeed. They're vusting their ass. They're really passionate about it,

554
01:02:09.12 --> 01:02:13.36
but they don't have the discipline. And if you don't have the discipline, the passion is not

555
01:02:13.36 --> 01:02:18.56
enough. You have to have the discipline too. And I don't tell you this, the passion, the discipline,

556
01:02:18.56 --> 01:02:23.28
the passion is also equally weak. Maybe not as weak. But it's equally weak.

557
01:02:23.28 --> 01:02:32.80
It's close. We'll say close. Unity and confidence cannot be improvised.

558
01:02:32.80 --> 01:02:38.64
They alone can create mutual trust that feeling of force which gives courage and daring.

559
01:02:38.64 --> 01:02:45.28
Courage, that is the temporary domination of will over instinct brings about victory.

560
01:02:45.28 --> 01:02:52.64
Unity alone then produces fighters. But as in everything, there are degrees of unity.

561
01:02:53.28 --> 01:03:00.56
Let us see whether modern is in this respect less exacting than ancient combat.

562
01:03:01.28 --> 01:03:08.40
These are very cool examples right here. Sometimes I'm like, I really read that whole thing.

563
01:03:08.40 --> 01:03:10.24
And then I think, oh yeah, I'm going to read the whole thing.

564
01:03:10.24 --> 01:03:16.64
So this, but these are just very cool because you're going to get a direct comparison of

565
01:03:17.52 --> 01:03:23.76
ancient combat psychologically and modern combat psychologically. And to understand one,

566
01:03:23.76 --> 01:03:29.60
it's good to have a frame of reference of the other. Back to the book, in ancient combat,

567
01:03:29.60 --> 01:03:36.56
there was danger only at close quarters. If the troops had enough morale to meet the enemy at

568
01:03:36.56 --> 01:03:42.56
broad source length, there was an engagement. Whoever was that close new that he would be killed,

569
01:03:42.56 --> 01:03:47.44
if he turned his back. Because as if we have seen, the victors lost but a few

570
01:03:48.64 --> 01:03:56.24
and the vanquished works exterminated. That's this simple reasoning held the men and made them fight.

571
01:03:56.24 --> 01:04:01.76
If it was but for an instant. So we already talked about that. You think you're going to die?

572
01:04:01.76 --> 01:04:05.28
You're going to fight or die? You're going to fight. You're going to release give it a shot.

573
01:04:06.96 --> 01:04:12.08
Neglecting the exceptional and very rare circumstances, which may bring two forces together,

574
01:04:12.08 --> 01:04:20.16
action today is brought out on and fought out from afar. Danger begins at great distances.

575
01:04:20.16 --> 01:04:26.32
And it is necessary to advance for a long time under fire at each step with the

576
01:04:26.32 --> 01:04:32.40
in which each step becomes heavier. The vanquished loses prisoners but often,

577
01:04:33.12 --> 01:04:38.08
in dead and wounded, he does not lose more than the victor. Sorry, I talked about that.

578
01:04:39.28 --> 01:04:44.16
Ancient combat was fought in groups close together with a small space in open ground in full

579
01:04:44.16 --> 01:04:50.64
view of one another without the deafening noise of present day arms. Men information,

580
01:04:50.64 --> 01:04:55.04
marches into action that took place on the spot and did not carry them thousands of feet away

581
01:04:55.04 --> 01:05:01.52
from the starting point. The surveillance of the leaders was easy. Individual weakness was immediately

582
01:05:01.52 --> 01:05:10.32
checked. General consternation alone caused flight. Today, fighting is done over immense

583
01:05:10.32 --> 01:05:17.76
spaces. Along thinly drawn outlines broken every instant by the accidents and the obstacles of the terrain.

584
01:05:18.80 --> 01:05:24.24
From time from the time action begins as soon as there are rifle shots, the men spread out as

585
01:05:24.24 --> 01:05:31.36
skirmishers or lost in the inevitable disorder of the rapid march escape the supervision of their

586
01:05:31.36 --> 01:05:39.84
commanding officers. Considerable number, conceal themselves. They get away from the engagement and

587
01:05:39.84 --> 01:05:46.56
diminished by just so much the material morale effect and confidence of the brave one,

588
01:05:46.56 --> 01:05:54.48
ones who remain. This can bring about defeat. Modern combat and again were in 1860s.

589
01:05:55.76 --> 01:06:01.04
You start charging and the lines broken up and the commanding officer can't so if you're thinking

590
01:06:01.04 --> 01:06:04.88
maybe you want to just live through this one, you might just get down a little trench, get down a little

591
01:06:04.88 --> 01:06:10.72
depression, get behind a tree and sit there and wait. But if we're online in ancient combat,

592
01:06:10.72 --> 01:06:18.72
there was nowhere to go. The commander could see you and your buddies could see you. Back to the book.

593
01:06:20.16 --> 01:06:26.32
But let us look at man himself and ancient and modern combat. In ancient combat, this is cool.

594
01:06:26.32 --> 01:06:33.68
In ancient combat, I am strong, apt, vigorous, trained, full of calmness, presence of mind.

595
01:06:33.68 --> 01:06:40.24
I have good offensive and defensive weapons and trustworthy companions of long-standing.

596
01:06:40.96 --> 01:06:46.000
They do not let me be overwhelmed without aiding me. I with them, they with me,

597
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.40
we are invincible even invulnerable. We have fought 20 battles and not one of us remained on the field.

598
01:06:52.40 --> 01:06:55.44
It is necessary to pour each other into support each other in time.

599
01:06:56.16 --> 01:07:01.84
Covered move. We see it clearly. We are quick to replace ourselves to put a fresh combatant in front of

600
01:07:01.84 --> 01:07:10.32
a fatigue adversary. We are the legions, 50,000 who have held out against the furious avalanches of

601
01:07:10.32 --> 01:07:18.64
the Kimberi. We have killed 140,000 taking prisoner 60,000 while losing but two or 300 of our

602
01:07:18.64 --> 01:07:25.04
inexperienced soldiers. That is sort of a mentality. Back in the day. When I say back in the

603
01:07:25.04 --> 01:07:32.88
day, I am talking ancient times, way back in the day. Now here is the modern soldier, at least 1860

604
01:07:32.88 --> 01:07:43.76
soldier. Today, as strong, firm, trained and courageous as I am, I can never say I shall return.

605
01:07:44.72 --> 01:07:54.64
I have no longer to do with men who might do not fear. I have to do with fate in the form

606
01:07:54.64 --> 01:08:04.96
of iron and lead. Death is in the air, invisible and blind, whispering, whistling, as brave,

607
01:08:04.96 --> 01:08:10.80
good trustworthy and devoted as my companions may be. They do not shield me.

608
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.56
Only, and this is abstract and less immediately intelligible to all than the material support of

609
01:08:18.56 --> 01:08:26.08
ancient combat. Only I imagine that the more numerous who we are who run a dangerous risk,

610
01:08:26.08 --> 01:08:34.48
the greater is the chance for which for each to escape their from. I also know that, if we have

611
01:08:34.48 --> 01:08:40.64
confidence which none of us should lack in action, we feel stronger and we are. We begin more

612
01:08:40.64 --> 01:08:46.32
resolutely, are ready to keep up the struggle longer and therefore finish it more quickly. But that

613
01:08:46.32 --> 01:08:51.76
is just, you know, I've talked about World War I, I don't like World War I, I don't want to fight

614
01:08:51.76 --> 01:08:56.80
World War I because you know, as a matter of a tactician, you are, you are just going to charge

615
01:08:56.80 --> 01:09:02.96
and it's going to be horrible. Well, if you take that a step further, I guess I would love to be

616
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:07.12
in a situation where I'm fighting with a sword against another guy, because now I could have

617
01:09:07.12 --> 01:09:12.56
trained, I could rely on the guy next to me. We could, you have so much control because even

618
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:16.32
World War II, any, any other modern war, like he's just saying, you're not scared of the enemy

619
01:09:16.32 --> 01:09:21.20
necessarily, you're scared of a random bullet, you're scared of a random piece of sharp no hitting

620
01:09:21.20 --> 01:09:26.24
you and that's could come at any time. So it's the psychology is very, very different.

621
01:09:29.12 --> 01:09:33.76
Back to the modern soldier here, we finish it, but in order to finish it is necessary to advance

622
01:09:33.76 --> 01:09:41.92
to attack the enemy and infantrymen or troopers, we are naked against iron, naked against

623
01:09:41.92 --> 01:09:50.48
lead, which cannot miss at close range. So again, you against me with a sword, we got a battle,

624
01:09:50.48 --> 01:09:56.48
right? You against me with a gun if you get your shot off him dead. Is it? I'm naked against that.

625
01:09:56.48 --> 01:10:00.64
There's no shield. I'm going to stop it. I mean, now we have body armor, but your chance

626
01:10:00.64 --> 01:10:04.24
of getting hit in the body armor, although it's saved many, many lives, but it's not a

627
01:10:04.24 --> 01:10:11.76
definitely not a guarantee. Let us advance in any case, resolute the our adversary will not

628
01:10:11.76 --> 01:10:17.44
stand up to the point blank range of our rifle. For the attack is never mutual, we are sure of that.

629
01:10:18.08 --> 01:10:24.16
We've been told so a thousand times that we have seen it, but what if matters should change now?

630
01:10:24.16 --> 01:10:30.16
Suppose the enemy stands at point blank range, what if it then? So you say, you know, who's

631
01:10:30.16 --> 01:10:35.04
going to stand up when you have a point blank range? How far is that from Roman confidence?

632
01:10:35.84 --> 01:10:40.08
In another place, we have shown that an ancient times to retire from action was both

633
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:45.68
difficult and perilous matter for the soldier. Today, the temptation is much stronger.

634
01:10:46.56 --> 01:10:56.40
The facility greater and the peril less. Now, therefore combat execs more, more cohesion,

635
01:10:56.40 --> 01:11:00.80
greater unity than previously. So that's exactly what I was talking about earlier. If it

636
01:11:00.80 --> 01:11:06.16
will modern combat, you know, little ditched to hide and find a little doorway, you're going to get

637
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:14.40
into, especially in this kind of, you know, this is a little bit pre-world war one, obviously,

638
01:11:14.40 --> 01:11:18.64
but they're still charging, right? They're still getting up and charging.

639
01:11:22.24 --> 01:11:26.88
So because everyone's all disaggregated across the battlefield, here we go, back to the

640
01:11:26.88 --> 01:11:30.88
book, Supervision becomes more and more difficult. Direction being more distant,

641
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:37.20
tends to be, tends more often to escape from the Supreme Commanders and the subordinate leaders.

642
01:11:38.08 --> 01:11:44.24
The certain and inevitable disorder, which a body of troops always presents an action,

643
01:11:44.24 --> 01:11:49.44
is with moral effect of modern appliances becoming greater every day. So we are getting more and

644
01:11:49.44 --> 01:11:53.68
more spread out in the battlefield. In the midst of the confusion and the vast

645
01:11:53.68 --> 01:11:59.36
relation of firing lines, men and officers often lose each other. Now, we have some improvements

646
01:11:59.36 --> 01:12:04.56
nowadays. You know, we've got radios that are going to travel longer distances. We've got devices

647
01:12:04.56 --> 01:12:10.64
that allow people to know each other are. So there's some things there that we've closed up a little

648
01:12:10.64 --> 01:12:17.20
bit, but if you think your radio is always going to work on the battlefield here. That's why

649
01:12:17.20 --> 01:12:22.64
decentralized command is so important. Back to the book, in troops which do the fighting the

650
01:12:22.64 --> 01:12:28.24
men and officers closest to them from corporal to batain commander have a more independent action

651
01:12:28.24 --> 01:12:33.20
than ever. Right. We've got to have our troops know what's going on. As it is alone, the

652
01:12:33.20 --> 01:12:37.68
bigger of that action, more independent than ever, the direction of higher commanders,

653
01:12:37.68 --> 01:12:43.04
which leaves the hands of higher commanders available forces, which can be directed at a decisive

654
01:12:43.04 --> 01:12:50.24
moment. The action becomes more preponderant than ever. Battles now more than ever are battles

655
01:12:50.24 --> 01:12:56.72
of men and captains. So this is pure decentralized command. It's pure, letting making sure that

656
01:12:56.72 --> 01:13:00.24
everyone knows what the commander's intent is and they can execute out of the battlefield without

657
01:13:00.24 --> 01:13:03.04
you having to tell them what to do. They better know what to do on their own.

658
01:13:06.48 --> 01:13:12.32
This completes the demonstration of the truth state before. Combat requires today in order to

659
01:13:12.32 --> 01:13:20.56
give the best results a moral cohesion. A unity more binding than at any other time.

660
01:13:20.56 --> 01:13:29.92
It is as true as it is clear that if one does not wish the bonds to break, one must make

661
01:13:29.92 --> 01:13:41.60
them elastic in order to strengthen them. Very, very, very, very, very, very poignant that. Right?

662
01:13:41.60 --> 01:13:46.64
Because the more we train control things, the less control we're going to have in these

663
01:13:46.64 --> 01:13:54.96
matte modern combat and it business and in life the more constructive you are that the more rigid

664
01:13:54.96 --> 01:13:58.88
you are, the less control you're going to have. It's just not going to be able to flex and flow

665
01:13:58.88 --> 01:14:01.68
with all the craziness that happens out on the battle. It's not going to work.

666
01:14:04.80 --> 01:14:14.16
decentralized command all day. Back to the book, the art of wars subjected to many modifications

667
01:14:14.16 --> 01:14:18.40
by industrial and scientific progress, but one thing does not change the heart of man.

668
01:14:19.28 --> 01:14:26.08
In the last analysis, success in battles a matter of morale. In all matters which pertain to an

669
01:14:26.08 --> 01:14:31.44
army, organization, discipline and tactics, the human heart in the supreme moment of battle is the

670
01:14:31.44 --> 01:14:39.20
basic factor. It is rarely taken into account and often strange errors are the result. Witness the

671
01:14:39.20 --> 01:14:46.48
carbine and accurate long-range weapon which has never given the service expected of it because it

672
01:14:46.48 --> 01:14:52.64
was used mechanically without considering the human heart we must consider it. With improvement in

673
01:14:52.64 --> 01:14:57.92
weapons, the power of destruction increases, the moral effect of such weapon increases and

674
01:14:57.92 --> 01:15:07.12
courage to face them becomes rare. Man does not cannot change. What should increase the power of material

675
01:15:07.12 --> 01:15:13.84
is the strength of organization, the unity of the fighting machine. Yet these are the most neglected.

676
01:15:13.84 --> 01:15:20.88
So we run into this all time with with echelon front, right? We are leadership.

677
01:15:20.88 --> 01:15:24.40
That's what we talk about. That's what we talk about as leadership. And oftentimes when we work

678
01:15:24.40 --> 01:15:28.96
with a company, what their focus on trying to fix the problem that they have, they focus on

679
01:15:29.84 --> 01:15:34.80
the symptom, right? They focus on the process that this must be messed up or we've got people that

680
01:15:34.80 --> 01:15:42.40
aren't following our instructions or we've got growth that we're trying to maintain and it's not

681
01:15:42.40 --> 01:15:46.88
coming out the way we want to. But they're looking at, they're not looking at the human heart, right?

682
01:15:47.44 --> 01:15:52.08
And that's the first thing we look at. That's the main thing we look at. And I'll tell you this

683
01:15:52.08 --> 01:15:59.92
100% of the time when we go to a company and no matter what the problem is, no matter what the

684
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:06.96
problem is, I will tell you the solution of the problem is with the leadership period in the story,

685
01:16:06.96 --> 01:16:10.56
period in the story. Oh, we've got a process that's messed up. Okay, who's in charge of the process?

686
01:16:10.56 --> 01:16:13.60
Give me that person's name. I'll talk him. Let's get a leadership working.

687
01:16:14.56 --> 01:16:19.28
Oh, we've got decisions that are being made. Well, that's a leadership problem. We've got manufacturing.

688
01:16:19.28 --> 01:16:26.000
That's that's not up to speed. It's not good quality. Is that the manufacturing problem?

689
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.04
Is that the problem with the machines? No, there's a leader. That's in charge of that.

690
01:16:31.76 --> 01:16:37.20
That is allowing this slack to happen. It is about leadership. It is about the human heart.

691
01:16:37.20 --> 01:16:41.92
It's what is it about? What is it about? He said that before about morale.

692
01:16:42.96 --> 01:16:49.28
Talk about morale. I think even one of the books said they do something to lower their morale.

693
01:16:49.28 --> 01:16:52.24
Like they're attacking their morale. I think I feel like everything might have been the

694
01:16:52.24 --> 01:16:58.72
chetions of a forget. Yeah, but well, every army does that. Oh, they try to attack the morale of the enemy.

695
01:16:58.72 --> 01:17:03.12
If you can beat the morale, you're going to beat the army in many cases. Yeah, because so it's kind of like

696
01:17:04.40 --> 01:17:07.92
if you make them not want to fight, they're not going to really want to fight or not going to fight.

697
01:17:08.96 --> 01:17:14.08
That's what makes you know in the Vietnam War, what hurt our morale so bad, booby traps.

698
01:17:15.20 --> 01:17:20.72
What hurt our morale so bad, mortar fire, sniper fire, and you're losing guys,

699
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:25.28
but you're not having anyone to engage against. Yeah. And you're not taking any ground holding it.

700
01:17:25.28 --> 01:17:30.96
That's one thing they did nicely in Iraq. We could see that we were making progress.

701
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:36.32
And so although we'd take, you know, your hard-brying stand talk about it in the area where he was,

702
01:17:36.80 --> 01:17:42.16
there was progress was made. And you can look at it and see it. And so therefore you're making these sacrifices,

703
01:17:42.16 --> 01:17:47.04
but you know that there's progress occurring. Yeah. And so that you're taking hits to your morale,

704
01:17:47.04 --> 01:17:51.20
but your morale is also building back up because you know that you're making progress. Yeah.

705
01:17:55.36 --> 01:17:56.72
This is an interesting comment.

706
01:17:58.80 --> 01:18:02.08
For brave men who do not know each other will not dare attack a lion.

707
01:18:02.64 --> 01:18:10.32
For less brave, but knowing each other well, sure of their reliability and consequently of mutual aid,

708
01:18:10.32 --> 01:18:17.68
will attack resolutely. There is the science of organization of armies in a nutshell.

709
01:18:18.48 --> 01:18:22.48
Now this is kind of a strange thing to me because I understand what he's saying.

710
01:18:22.48 --> 01:18:25.84
But I have no, I don't know what they mean by attack a lion.

711
01:18:25.84 --> 01:18:31.28
Well, we got guns. Do we have swords? It seems like a lion.

712
01:18:31.28 --> 01:18:36.24
Before guys, I don't like those chances. What do you do? You can't do a take down on a lion.

713
01:18:36.24 --> 01:18:41.20
You do the Matalio. Yeah, I know you did a mountain lion. Yeah, I understand that.

714
01:18:41.20 --> 01:18:45.84
But I think it was a metaphor. Yeah. No, I know. It's a good metaphor. But I try to take things, you know,

715
01:18:45.84 --> 01:18:49.28
or sometimes I think a thing is a realistic way. If you ever seen the claws on a lion, yeah.

716
01:18:49.28 --> 01:18:52.64
Yeah, no, no. Four guys, there was a lion. I don't think it's going to work out. Good. If you have no weapons.

717
01:18:52.64 --> 01:18:58.96
If you have some weapons, but you don't want to be the one guy like, you know, the sacrificial guy that does the first attack.

718
01:18:58.96 --> 01:19:03.60
So I can get to the neck. Echo. You run at him, bro. I got your back.

719
01:19:03.60 --> 01:19:07.28
I'm going to run up and stab it in the head. But that's after you got a

720
01:19:08.40 --> 01:19:13.84
jugular removed by his claw. But see what he's saying is if you can rely on me. Yeah, for sure.

721
01:19:13.84 --> 01:19:20.000
You'll do it. I don't know if I can really rely on myself being the big though.

722
01:19:21.12 --> 01:19:27.36
Check. Back to the book. Anytime a new invention may assure victory. At any time a new

723
01:19:27.36 --> 01:19:34.48
invention may assure victory. Granted, but practical weapons are not invented every day and nations quickly put themselves on the same footing

724
01:19:34.48 --> 01:19:38.32
and as regards to armament. The determining factor leaving aside

725
01:19:39.36 --> 01:19:44.88
generals of genius and luck is the quality of the troops. That is the organization that best assures the

726
01:19:44.88 --> 01:19:49.44
esprit, reliability, the confidence in the union. Again, we're just talking about the technology comes out.

727
01:19:50.56 --> 01:19:55.60
That's great. There's something more important than that. And that is the the relationships.

728
01:19:55.60 --> 01:20:05.76
The relationships. That's what's most important. Back to the book. The purpose of discipline is to

729
01:20:05.76 --> 01:20:13.60
make men fight in spite of themselves. No army is worth. No army is worthy of the name without discipline.

730
01:20:14.96 --> 01:20:19.60
There is no army at all without organization and organization is defective which neglects

731
01:20:19.60 --> 01:20:27.44
neglects any means to strengthen the unity of combatants. Methods cannot be identical. This is so

732
01:20:27.44 --> 01:20:33.36
so important. Methods cannot be identical. So you can just throw this discipline all the same to

733
01:20:33.36 --> 01:20:40.64
everyone. Listen to this. Tracony in discipline does not fit our customs. Discipline must be a

734
01:20:40.64 --> 01:20:46.72
state of mind, a social institution based on salient virtues and defects of the nations.

735
01:20:46.72 --> 01:20:54.72
Discipline cannot be secured or created in a day. It is an institution. A tradition

736
01:20:55.92 --> 01:21:01.12
the commander must have confidence in his right to command. He must be a customs to command

737
01:21:01.12 --> 01:21:09.20
and proud to command. This is what strengthens discipline in armies commanded by an aristocracy in

738
01:21:09.20 --> 01:21:15.52
certain countries. So I just think it's very important because again, I don't want people to listen

739
01:21:15.52 --> 01:21:20.72
to the podcast to go, that's right. We're going to lay down the discipline now at the company.

740
01:21:20.72 --> 01:21:24.32
Everyone's going to follow the rules. No. It can't be dracony and it's got to be a part of the

741
01:21:24.32 --> 01:21:32.16
culture. People got to want there to be discipline. Very important. Back to the book, ancient

742
01:21:32.16 --> 01:21:36.96
battle resembled drill and when they say drill, you're ever seeing people marching like on a parade

743
01:21:36.96 --> 01:21:42.64
ground. That's drill. Okay. Ancient battle resembled drill. There is no such resemblance in modern

744
01:21:42.64 --> 01:21:49.60
battle. This greatly disconserts both officers and soldiers. Ancient battles were picknicks for the

745
01:21:49.60 --> 01:21:56.24
victors who lost nobody, not so today. Artillery played no part in ancient battle. The invention

746
01:21:56.24 --> 01:22:05.52
of firearms has diminished losses in battle. Again, you can see he was not 100% correct because

747
01:22:05.52 --> 01:22:10.96
he couldn't see into the future, but he's saying at the time there was less losses in battle

748
01:22:10.96 --> 01:22:19.28
because of the firearms. Obviously that turned out to be true just to what 50 years later in World War

749
01:22:19.28 --> 01:22:26.56
one, we get to obscene and horrible levels of casualties from the firearms. Why is that? Because

750
01:22:26.56 --> 01:22:31.52
they can, well, as far as what he said, because they could fire from a safe fire. Yeah, I'm sure

751
01:22:31.52 --> 01:22:38.56
it's because they could fire from a safe spot. And the momentum of the battle and therefore

752
01:22:38.56 --> 01:22:46.24
victory in defeat could occur at a greater distance and it meant that once that occurred,

753
01:22:46.24 --> 01:22:50.64
the people could run away. Yeah. And so we were losing, we're going to run away. Whereas no

754
01:22:50.64 --> 01:22:55.12
days, we're in the game. We start to beat you. I'm hacking your head off and all of the people

755
01:22:55.12 --> 01:22:59.36
with you and you're trying to run away. We got archers lined up and we're all we're all on a football

756
01:22:59.36 --> 01:23:03.92
field. You know, maybe maybe five or six football fields. You know, thousand yards, maybe ten

757
01:23:03.92 --> 01:23:08.88
football fields. We're all there. And when we start getting the upper hand, you're not going to

758
01:23:08.88 --> 01:23:12.80
get away from me. In fact, you're, I mean, according to him, you turn your back to run away. Yeah,

759
01:23:12.80 --> 01:23:17.68
that's guaranteed. Yeah. Whereas, hey, we can retreat. We can surrender. And then we guess what?

760
01:23:17.68 --> 01:23:21.92
I mean, modern modern surrenders, you know, they take place almost like a formal,

761
01:23:22.72 --> 01:23:27.28
yeah, you know, you come in your general comes and surrounds signs the paper and then we take over

762
01:23:27.28 --> 01:23:33.60
your country. Yeah. You know, whatever. Signs of the paper. Yeah, no, they signed, they signed surrender

763
01:23:33.60 --> 01:23:38.56
papers. There really ends your pan, both signed, you know, on conditional surrenders. Yeah,

764
01:23:38.56 --> 01:23:42.88
that sounded kind of like, which is how you're supposed to win wars. Yeah, on conditional surrender.

765
01:23:43.84 --> 01:23:49.28
And then the beloved benevolence of our country says, okay, now we'll, we'll help you rebuild.

766
01:23:49.28 --> 01:23:54.72
And, you know, you can be a square away democracy. Hey, remember, um, just the,

767
01:23:54.72 --> 01:23:58.16
here's a question. So in war, like, if you're, like, on the save of our own,

768
01:23:58.16 --> 01:24:02.64
and there's a small little clip where the guys are like surrendering, and they still shoot them.

769
01:24:02.64 --> 01:24:06.24
Is that like illegal, like, can't do that? Yeah, you're not supposed to do that. Yeah.

770
01:24:06.24 --> 01:24:12.24
Yep. It is illegal. It's against the law of armed combat. Remember, the first Iraq war

771
01:24:12.24 --> 01:24:16.32
when the guys were like, so finding anything they could that was going to happen. I got asked that on

772
01:24:16.32 --> 01:24:21.20
on social media guys like, well, what determines? I said, you know, where you, you have to do the right thing

773
01:24:21.20 --> 01:24:24.32
in combat. So what the sort of who determines the right thing? I was like, well, the Geneva convention

774
01:24:24.32 --> 01:24:28.56
of the law of armed combat. Next question. Like, there's a rule to follow. Yeah. It's like we're pulling

775
01:24:28.56 --> 01:24:34.72
it, you know, out of thin air. Yeah. It's not a, you know, making it up as we go. Yeah, making it

776
01:24:36.08 --> 01:24:41.52
back to the book. The greater perfection of weapons, the more dreadful becomes modern battle

777
01:24:41.52 --> 01:24:47.28
and discipline becomes more difficult to maintain. That's a wide, so awesome. When you see

778
01:24:47.28 --> 01:24:57.36
the US Marine Corps doing the island hopping campaign and the amount of discipline that it takes

779
01:24:57.36 --> 01:25:04.24
to go, when you're dug in and you're in a bunker, you're a Japanese imperial soldier and you're

780
01:25:04.24 --> 01:25:11.20
in a bunker and you have a machine gun and your sights are set on the beach. The amount of

781
01:25:11.20 --> 01:25:19.60
discipline that it takes to go on to that beach is an American Marine or sailor, corpsman or army

782
01:25:19.60 --> 01:25:24.80
soldier that's coming on. It's just incredible. It's absolutely incredibly defies what the peak

783
01:25:24.80 --> 01:25:29.36
is saying. Some of the stuff that the peak says about fear and all this and guys are going to turn.

784
01:25:29.36 --> 01:25:33.36
Apparently, you never work with the US Marine Corps. Apparently, never work with the

785
01:25:33.36 --> 01:25:39.52
hundred first airborne. Those guys? No. I mean, I'm calling out a couple units, but come on,

786
01:25:39.52 --> 01:25:48.56
these guys are, it's amazing. It's amazing. The amount of heroism and discipline to overcome

787
01:25:48.56 --> 01:25:56.16
that that spirit of self-preservation. And obviously, but, you know, tons of special operations

788
01:25:56.16 --> 01:26:06.08
to guys and just it's impressive. It really is. It is very impressive. I was humbled to see that

789
01:26:06.08 --> 01:26:13.76
stuff and with my own two eyes. Back to the book, the nature of ancient arms requires close order

790
01:26:13.76 --> 01:26:20.000
modern arms require open order. And they are at the same time of such terrible power that

791
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.24
against them too often disciplines broken. So imagine this, this is tough because in ancient

792
01:26:26.24 --> 01:26:31.52
war, we're all close together. And so it's easier to maintain discipline. But when we all get spread

793
01:26:31.52 --> 01:26:35.60
out modern war, it's harder to maintain the discipline. Yeah, plus nobody's looking to. Yeah.

794
01:26:36.88 --> 01:26:42.24
Discipline and battle becomes more necessary as ranks become more open. And the material cohesion

795
01:26:42.24 --> 01:26:48.64
of the ranks, not giving confidence. It must spring from a knowledge of comrades and a trust

796
01:26:48.64 --> 01:26:53.84
in officers who must always be present and seen. So leaders, you gotta be seen.

797
01:26:55.36 --> 01:27:00.08
What man today advances with the confidence that rigid discipline and pride of an in himself

798
01:27:00.08 --> 01:27:06.80
gave the Roman soldier, even though the contest is no longer with man, but with fate.

799
01:27:07.84 --> 01:27:13.04
Think about that. The contest in modern warfare oftentimes, not all the time,

800
01:27:13.60 --> 01:27:18.16
is fate. Am I going to step on an ID? Am I going to get hit by a random bullet? Am I going to

801
01:27:19.60 --> 01:27:28.56
there's the war now is much more random. It's much more random. Bad luck can cost your life. Good

802
01:27:28.56 --> 01:27:35.68
luck can save your life. Good tactics will put more luck on your side. Bad tactics will turn luck

803
01:27:35.68 --> 01:27:40.80
against you, but there's always luck involved in modern warfare. So that's what you're up against

804
01:27:40.80 --> 01:27:49.20
your up against fate. So you know what I'll tell you? Like when he talks about this modern warfare

805
01:27:49.20 --> 01:27:54.56
of, you know, and even when I talk about like, hey guys going out the turret, you know,

806
01:27:54.56 --> 01:28:00.000
guys going out on the operation after operation in the money, sometimes you know, guys would think

807
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.36
they're going to die. But a lot of times like, no, I'm not going to get killed. It's not going to happen.

808
01:28:04.56 --> 01:28:10.08
You have the sort of hey, it's not going to happen. If it does, I won't know it. Check.

809
01:28:10.08 --> 01:28:15.44
Let's rock and roll. You know what I mean? It's a different. So I want to make sure that I'm not

810
01:28:15.44 --> 01:28:20.16
making it sound like the lead turret gunner is sitting up there going out tonight. It's the night.

811
01:28:20.16 --> 01:28:24.24
He overcomes that in one of the ways you overcome this. Yeah, that's not going to happen to me.

812
01:28:25.12 --> 01:28:28.32
It's not going to happen to me. You know, we've heard that from some other books. You know, they don't

813
01:28:28.32 --> 01:28:32.48
think it's going to happen to yourself. It's going to happen to that guy. It might happen to the guy

814
01:28:32.48 --> 01:28:38.16
next to me. I'm going to be good to go. It's like when you're on a plane and you think this plane,

815
01:28:38.16 --> 01:28:41.84
you know, if this plane crashes, you know, a big commercial plane jetliner or whatever,

816
01:28:42.96 --> 01:28:48.64
I think I'm going to live. Like, guys, my attitude is like, if this thing crashes, I will live.

817
01:28:48.64 --> 01:28:57.36
You know, I'm going to I will land somewhere and track using my free fall capabilities and I'll

818
01:28:57.36 --> 01:29:02.40
find a pool and I'll track to the pool and then I'll get all spread out in the last minute. I'm

819
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:06.40
going to, you know, I think I'm going to live like if you fall out of the plane. No, if the plane

820
01:29:06.40 --> 01:29:11.36
explodes in midair, right, and you fall out. Like, you know, those crashes where everyone dies on the plane.

821
01:29:11.36 --> 01:29:16.24
Yes. If I'm on the plane, I'm going to make it. Right. The only one. That's like the attitude.

822
01:29:16.24 --> 01:29:20.80
So you can, you can, if I can have that attitude about being on a plane, I can have that attitude and a

823
01:29:20.80 --> 01:29:25.36
bunch of guys can have that attitude going into combat. Like, hey, I'm not going to get killed.

824
01:29:25.36 --> 01:29:31.36
Bring it. What do you got? Yeah. They can go, I think that's called availability bias. I

825
01:29:31.36 --> 01:29:36.40
think that goes both ways. It's like what's the availability? What availability means it's,

826
01:29:36.40 --> 01:29:41.12
I mean, the way that the reason they call it availability is because it's available in your mind.

827
01:29:41.12 --> 01:29:46.48
Just that thought. You know, it's just, it's, it's, it's, it's basically is that one girl that

828
01:29:47.52 --> 01:29:52.16
lived through one of those crashes back in 1975. I'm like, hey, she could do it. I'm like,

829
01:29:52.16 --> 01:29:57.44
that's good. I remember. I always hear about that hero story, even though all the other millions of

830
01:29:57.44 --> 01:30:02.08
stories everybody that like like winning the lottery. It's why people buy lottery tickets, even though

831
01:30:02.08 --> 01:30:06.72
you'd like the chance of you dying on the way to buy a lot of tickets higher than you winning in the

832
01:30:06.72 --> 01:30:11.28
year. Oh, I'm a little bad. I'm a little bit. It's going to be someone might as well be me.

833
01:30:11.84 --> 01:30:13.04
Can't win if you don't play.

834
01:30:16.16 --> 01:30:20.56
Yeah, so I think I think a lot of guys have that same attitude as I'm talking about. And I know

835
01:30:20.56 --> 01:30:24.56
they do because I talked to them about it. You're not, maybe not specific, but no one's going, oh,

836
01:30:24.56 --> 01:30:28.16
you know, I'm really, you know, I'm really, you know, believe me, we get guys that think they're

837
01:30:28.16 --> 01:30:31.52
going to die every 10 that go out. You know, got some paranoid brothers that'd be like,

838
01:30:31.52 --> 01:30:36.16
and I don't feel good about this one. Because you know, you can be okay, buddy. Yeah, yeah. No, man.

839
01:30:36.16 --> 01:30:42.80
I don't know who, who, who, what's the shot? That's brilliant. Yeah. Even even then they sound

840
01:30:42.80 --> 01:30:47.04
pretty hard to go. Yeah, well, the funny thing is like one of my most paranoid

841
01:30:47.04 --> 01:30:51.52
brothers that was always paranoid who's going to die. He always, in fact, I was going to send him home.

842
01:30:51.52 --> 01:30:56.56
Not, they used the ended deployment. Yeah. And we had planes and we had to fill up the planes with

843
01:30:56.56 --> 01:31:00.80
guys to go home. And one of the other guys, the senior guy said to me like, hey, we need to,

844
01:31:00.80 --> 01:31:04.48
we need to send that guy home. You know, he's really stressed out. And I said, bro, he's not going to

845
01:31:04.48 --> 01:31:10.000
go home. Because I know, yeah. Oh, like if you say, go home, he won't want to go home. Yeah, he's not going

846
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.76
on. Oh, this is the guy that would be like, man, this is what we should be doing this off, man. I

847
01:31:13.76 --> 01:31:18.80
got that feeling about tonight, man. And I'd be a man. It's cool. You know, you're going to be all right.

848
01:31:18.80 --> 01:31:25.84
I think you can be all right, bro. And then so this other senior guy comes to me and says, hey,

849
01:31:25.84 --> 01:31:29.36
you know, you got to get this guy on a plane. And I go, bro, he's not going to go home. I know

850
01:31:29.36 --> 01:31:32.80
him. He's not going home. He's not going to want to go home. Dude, he's freaking out. I go, yeah, this is the

851
01:31:32.80 --> 01:31:37.44
way he is. Just his way of dealing with it. Any good school, you've got to send him home. And I

852
01:31:37.44 --> 01:31:42.40
go, I'm not going to send him home because we'll go ask him if he wants to go home. And I go, okay,

853
01:31:43.44 --> 01:31:49.36
so you know, we're going to launch or something in our little hut. And I go, hey, man, I want to get you

854
01:31:49.36 --> 01:31:53.84
on, you know, one of these early plans going home because fuck you. I'm not going anywhere. I was like,

855
01:31:53.84 --> 01:31:57.60
cool man, rock back. He's like, oh, what do you, he's like, what do you say? He's going to fuck

856
01:31:57.60 --> 01:32:02.40
him? Okay, cool. Look, guys, we can stay here. And, you know what, he did 10 more deployments after that

857
01:32:02.40 --> 01:32:07.20
deployment, you know what I mean? So he's a guy that like, like, I don't know, that's just the way

858
01:32:07.20 --> 01:32:12.16
he dealt with it. Yeah. With it through, bit. It's voicing and voicing is nervousness, but he just did

859
01:32:12.16 --> 01:32:18.24
it out loud. Change smoke and cigarettes. Get an after it and would never ever want to stay back

860
01:32:18.24 --> 01:32:23.52
off an operational matter. What it was, he said, you know, if I ever didn't put him on the

861
01:32:23.52 --> 01:32:28.24
forced list of the guys going out, he'd come to me like, what's the problem? Give me on there.

862
01:32:28.24 --> 01:32:34.40
Oh, yeah, bro. I can't leave him back. Yeah, it's just how, so it was, it probably wasn't the kind where

863
01:32:34.40 --> 01:32:39.84
he really did want to go home, but like how you say in the earlier, the culture kind of, I don't know what's

864
01:32:39.84 --> 01:32:44.80
inside of his head. Yeah. But definitely part of it is like, hey, I'm not going to be a pussy. I'm,

865
01:32:44.80 --> 01:32:49.84
I might be talking like I'm scared. Yeah. And like I don't want to do this. Don't you dare

866
01:32:49.84 --> 01:32:58.08
try and send me home. Yeah. Yeah. Now let me have another cigarette. I get after it. And yeah,

867
01:32:58.08 --> 01:33:03.28
actually that guy just retired one of my, one of my awesome brothers. Well, when, when they say,

868
01:33:04.08 --> 01:33:08.000
when the guys are like, oh, it's not going to happen to me, right? When you know about tying

869
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:14.24
and stuff, is that do you think that they really feel that it's not going to happen to me? Or is that

870
01:33:14.24 --> 01:33:18.96
a thing that they sort of tell themselves? Well, I can tell you that oftentimes I did not think

871
01:33:18.96 --> 01:33:25.68
I could be killed. Yeah. You know anyway, this is not going to happen. Right. I bring it. Yeah. Go ahead,

872
01:33:25.68 --> 01:33:31.20
bring it. And and I guess part of that a little 10% of that was like, hey, if I do get killed,

873
01:33:31.20 --> 01:33:37.76
whatever, I could go, you know, this is this kind of a good way to die. Right. I don't mind that way of

874
01:33:37.76 --> 01:33:42.40
dying, getting killed in combat. Right. I'm a Viking with a sword and I want to die within my hands.

875
01:33:42.40 --> 01:33:48.80
I don't want to die the way I'm going to die now. You know, now I got to live and

876
01:33:48.80 --> 01:33:55.52
get, do all this stuff. Right. That's pretty cool too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So, but technically. Yeah.

877
01:33:55.52 --> 01:33:59.52
But so there's a little bit of that. But I think guys probably fall in that whole spectrum. Yeah.

878
01:33:59.52 --> 01:34:03.76
Guys just didn't think they would get killed. And guys that just said they didn't think they

879
01:34:03.76 --> 01:34:06.56
could get killed. And guys that thought they really didn't get killed, but really didn't think they

880
01:34:06.56 --> 01:34:10.64
were getting killed. There's just man, you know what's going on. So as people inside people

881
01:34:10.64 --> 01:34:17.04
head, but what you got to do is pay as much attention to it as you can. And always be looking at

882
01:34:17.04 --> 01:34:24.000
people and trying to gauge where they're at mentally. Because yeah, it does. It does

883
01:34:24.72 --> 01:34:31.04
freak people out, you know, the continual specter of death. They can hang heavy. That's the end.

884
01:34:31.04 --> 01:34:35.76
And you know, I was never exposed to the kind of things that these people were going through.

885
01:34:35.76 --> 01:34:41.36
And World War II going on to go on to a beach going on where you're, you know, we're going to take

886
01:34:41.36 --> 01:34:47.36
40% casualties first two waves. You know, that means you're looking at your body like, okay,

887
01:34:47.36 --> 01:34:51.92
one of us ain't going to make it or one of us is at least going to get wounded bad. I was doing

888
01:34:51.92 --> 01:34:56.56
some more, I was doing some reading, you know, just some World War II reading. It's just crazy.

889
01:34:57.60 --> 01:35:01.44
How those guys were going, I mean, D days the same thing. D day, they found that you're going

890
01:35:01.44 --> 01:35:06.48
to take even worse casualties and they did. You know, actually the first goal for, I remember here in

891
01:35:06.48 --> 01:35:10.48
a port on on the news. I think it was CNN. Because yeah, it was the one CNN because I was the only

892
01:35:10.48 --> 01:35:15.36
cable news I think at the time. They was saying there's going to be 40,000 casualties in the first 48

893
01:35:15.36 --> 01:35:20.96
hours. I was like, oh, it's all. I'm going to get some. And that was literally my attitude, you know,

894
01:35:20.96 --> 01:35:25.44
and of course it was over in 72 hours and nothing happened. That's why I think that lowered us into

895
01:35:25.44 --> 01:35:29.60
a false sense of security and arrogance. The second goal for me said, oh, we're going to go into

896
01:35:29.60 --> 01:35:32.88
Iraq. Oh, yeah, I won't, you know, probably be done in two or three months or maybe a month. You know,

897
01:35:32.88 --> 01:35:37.60
maybe a month. And guess what, we got up to Baghdad in one, a couple, a couple weeks a week or two.

898
01:35:37.60 --> 01:35:42.32
And boom, we were there. Okay, this is going to be has this. Yeah, well, guess what? We looked, we didn't,

899
01:35:42.32 --> 01:35:48.80
we weren't expecting that insurgency to form and we didn't do a good job of transitioning the

900
01:35:48.80 --> 01:35:55.44
government properly. So we made some, I can't say we made some mistakes. Okay, I can say this,

901
01:35:55.44 --> 01:36:03.28
we made mistakes, but we, you don't know what's going to happen in war, right? We don't know the answers.

902
01:36:03.28 --> 01:36:08.88
If we knew what the answers were, we would do everything perfectly. You just don't know. It's like,

903
01:36:08.88 --> 01:36:14.000
it's like playing a football game, right? You don't know what's going to happen. Not only you

904
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.24
not know what the opponent's going to do, you don't know what passes are going to be caught and

905
01:36:18.24 --> 01:36:22.000
dropped and what the ref's going to call. There's all these variables that you just cannot know.

906
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.60
The only way you can know the outcome of a football game is to play the football game, right?

907
01:36:25.60 --> 01:36:28.96
The only way you can know what's going to happen in a war is the war happens and things are

908
01:36:28.96 --> 01:36:33.84
going to happen that you will not expect ever and you got to deal with. And we were a little slow

909
01:36:33.84 --> 01:36:39.28
to recognize, but again, we had false sense security. Hey, we beat these guys last time in 72 hours.

910
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.60
Okay, we want to take their country. So what's that going to mean? Two weeks? We should be good to go.

911
01:36:44.32 --> 01:36:50.80
You can never do that. You got to be ready for the long haul. Back to the book. In ancient

912
01:36:50.80 --> 01:36:55.68
battle, unity existed, at least with the Greeks and the Romans. The soldier was known to his officer

913
01:36:55.68 --> 01:37:02.88
in comrades. They saw that he fought. In modern armies, where losses are as great for the

914
01:37:02.88 --> 01:37:08.72
victor as the vanquished, the soldier must more often be replaced. In ancient battle, the victor

915
01:37:08.72 --> 01:37:15.68
had no losses or very limited losses. Today, the soldier is often unknown to his comrades. He is

916
01:37:15.68 --> 01:37:22.32
lost in the smoke. He's the dispersion, the confusion of battle. He seems to fight alone. Unity is no

917
01:37:22.32 --> 01:37:30.16
longer insured by mutual surveillance. A man falls in disappears. Who knows whether it was a bullet

918
01:37:31.20 --> 01:37:37.20
or the fear of advancing further than struck him. And again, we're talking, these guys are doing

919
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:44.80
sort of world war one style advances charges on positions. The ancient combat was never struck by

920
01:37:44.80 --> 01:37:51.36
an invisible weapon. It could not fall this way. The more difficult surveillance, the more necessary

921
01:37:51.36 --> 01:37:59.76
becomes the individuality of companies, sections, and squads. Dispersion brings us back to the

922
01:37:59.76 --> 01:38:08.96
necessity for the unity, which was the absolute necessity in ancient battle. So, another point here,

923
01:38:08.96 --> 01:38:13.28
the size of the battlefield permits less than ever holding units together. The role of the

924
01:38:13.28 --> 01:38:18.72
generals much more difficult. Many more chances are left to fate. Thus, the greater necessity

925
01:38:18.72 --> 01:38:25.60
for the troops who know best their trade, who are most dependable, and the greatest of fortitude.

926
01:38:25.60 --> 01:38:29.84
So, you gotta have even better soldiers now. Because you got a train, and better. Because there

927
01:38:29.84 --> 01:38:37.60
might be out there alone, or you know what two or three guys. There is a strange similarity in

928
01:38:37.60 --> 01:38:43.52
battle at one league to battle at two places. So, one league, meaning separated by 2,000 meters,

929
01:38:43.52 --> 01:38:50.96
2 places, and obviously, 2 places. The value of the soldier is the essential element of success.

930
01:38:52.40 --> 01:39:00.000
Let us strengthen the soldier by unity. And this is obviously, this is businesses, this is teams.

931
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.72
The tighter you are as a group, the better you're going to perform. Work that unity.

932
01:39:04.72 --> 01:39:10.88
The good quality of troops will more than ever secure victory.

933
01:39:15.92 --> 01:39:22.08
Nothing should be neglected to make the battle order stronger and the man stronger.

934
01:39:23.76 --> 01:39:29.52
This is good. When incomplete security, after dinner, in full physical and moral

935
01:39:29.52 --> 01:39:37.44
contentment, men consider war and battle they are animated by a noble arguer that has nothing

936
01:39:37.44 --> 01:39:43.44
in common with reality. Helmet. So, everyone is all brave when they're at the dinner table.

937
01:39:43.44 --> 01:39:48.56
The full bellies. How many of them, however, even at that moment, would be ready to risk their lives.

938
01:39:48.56 --> 01:39:52.40
So, even when they're at the dinner table, talking. Really, at that moment, how many people are ready to

939
01:39:52.40 --> 01:39:57.28
risk their lives. But, obliged them to march for days and weeks to arrive at the battle ground.

940
01:39:57.28 --> 01:40:02.16
And on the day of battle, obliged them to wait minutes hours to deliver it. If they were honest,

941
01:40:02.16 --> 01:40:06.64
they would testify how much the physical fatigue and the mental anguish that proceed,

942
01:40:06.64 --> 01:40:11.28
action have lowered them morale. How much less eager to fight, they are

943
01:40:12.24 --> 01:40:16.56
then a month before when they rose from the table in a generous mood.

944
01:40:18.72 --> 01:40:26.000
Man's heart is changeable as fortune. Man shrinks back and apprehends danger.

945
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.92
In any effort in which he does not foresee success.

946
01:40:31.28 --> 01:40:35.60
So, when we don't think we're going to be successful, we shrink back. We get worried about it.

947
01:40:36.64 --> 01:40:41.04
There are some isolated characters of iron-temper who resist the tendency, but they are

948
01:40:41.04 --> 01:40:46.32
carried away by the great minority. The examples show that if withdrawal is forced,

949
01:40:46.32 --> 01:40:52.32
the army is discouraged and takes flight. The brave heart does not change. Real bravery,

950
01:40:52.32 --> 01:40:58.08
inspired by devotion to duty, does not know panic and is always the same. The bravery

951
01:40:58.08 --> 01:41:06.08
sprung from a hot blood pleases the Frenchman more. He understands that it appeals to his vanity.

952
01:41:06.08 --> 01:41:14.16
It is a characteristic of his nature, but it is passing. It fails him at times, especially

953
01:41:14.16 --> 01:41:18.40
when there's nothing for him to gain by doing his duty. So, this is like motivation

954
01:41:18.40 --> 01:41:24.000
being fickle. If you're super fired up and now you want to go, that's going to fade away.

955
01:41:24.56 --> 01:41:28.96
That's not the kind of bravery we're looking for. We're looking for the constant steady bravery.

956
01:41:31.52 --> 01:41:37.76
The instinct of self-preservation can then make the strongest tremble,

957
01:41:37.76 --> 01:41:42.32
but they are strong enough to overcome their emotion, the fear of advancing, even losing their heads

958
01:41:42.32 --> 01:41:48.40
or their coolness. Fear with them never come becomes terror. It is forgotten in the activities of command.

959
01:41:49.12 --> 01:41:54.80
He who does not feel strong enough to keep his heart from ever being gripped by terror should

960
01:41:54.80 --> 01:42:03.44
never think of becoming an officer. Don't become an officer if you're going to get really

961
01:42:03.44 --> 01:42:08.72
scared. The soldiers themselves have emotions. Have emotion. The sense of duty discipline

962
01:42:08.72 --> 01:42:12.80
pride in the example of their officers and above all their coolness sustain them and prevent

963
01:42:12.80 --> 01:42:17.52
their fear from becoming terror. Their emotion never allows them to cite or

964
01:42:19.04 --> 01:42:23.44
to more than approximately adjust their fire. Often they fire into the air.

965
01:42:24.24 --> 01:42:31.36
Cromwell knew this well. Dependable as his troops were when he said, put your trust in God and

966
01:42:31.36 --> 01:42:37.20
aim at their shoelaces. That's something that we still teach. You know, when you're in a firefight,

967
01:42:37.20 --> 01:42:42.08
you shoot low. Shoot at the ground in front of the bad guys. Because you'll hit ricochets,

968
01:42:42.08 --> 01:42:47.60
the bullets will walk up into the bad guys. Ricochets will put stuff in their face and

969
01:42:48.32 --> 01:42:52.56
you'll at least hit something. If you aim high, you're going to shoot over the hands and hit

970
01:42:52.56 --> 01:42:59.20
nothing. Yeah, wasn't um. Oh, Roger Roger. He was saying he was kind of saying that right.

971
01:42:59.20 --> 01:43:03.12
Like the new guy's shoot a tent to shoot. Oh, yeah, for sure. He definitely said that. Yeah.

972
01:43:03.12 --> 01:43:08.64
No, they drilled us into that. Did you all die in a big time? Yeah, walk it in. Yeah.

973
01:43:08.64 --> 01:43:12.24
Walk it in. Shoot it in the laces. And that's another thing. When you're shooting high,

974
01:43:12.24 --> 01:43:15.28
you don't know where I went. When you shoot the ground, you can see we're hitting. You're like,

975
01:43:15.28 --> 01:43:23.52
okay, boom, I'm walking in. Walking in. Walking on in. What makes this soldier capable of obedience

976
01:43:23.52 --> 01:43:29.28
and direction and action is the sense of discipline. This includes respect for and confidence

977
01:43:29.28 --> 01:43:33.20
and his chiefs confidence in his comrades and fear of their approaches and retaliation if he

978
01:43:33.20 --> 01:43:36.88
abandons them in danger. This is peer pressure. Basically is what we're talking about.

979
01:43:38.96 --> 01:43:45.04
His desire to go where others do go without trembling more than they in a word, the whole of the

980
01:43:45.04 --> 01:43:53.84
speed of core. Organization only can produce these characteristics. Four men equal a lion.

981
01:43:53.84 --> 01:44:01.36
It is as predacor is secured in war, but war becomes shorter and shorter and more and more

982
01:44:01.36 --> 01:44:07.60
violent. Consequently secure a speed decor in advance. This is about training. That's what we're

983
01:44:07.60 --> 01:44:12.88
going to establish a speed of core. Mental equatemanship. This is a weird word for like friendship

984
01:44:12.88 --> 01:44:19.28
or brotherhood, mental acquaintance ship. It is not enough to make a good organization. A good

985
01:44:19.28 --> 01:44:27.68
general spree is needed. All were all must work for battle and not merely live quietly going through

986
01:44:27.68 --> 01:44:32.40
the drills without understanding their application. So you've got everyone understand what's going on.

987
01:44:32.40 --> 01:44:36.32
They got to understand why they're doing what they're doing. Once a man knows how to use his weapon

988
01:44:36.32 --> 01:44:42.000
and obey all commands, there is need. Needed only occasional drill to brush up those who have

989
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000
forgotten. Marches and battle maneuvers are what's needed. So don't just run the simple drills that

990
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.72
people know, this is the training that I used to run was battle maneuvers. That's what we're doing.

991
01:44:52.72 --> 01:44:56.56
And marches. Yes, you're going to get your long walk on. You're going to get conditioned. You're

992
01:44:56.56 --> 01:45:00.16
going to get tired. You're going to get fatigued. You're going to get after it. And you're going to

993
01:45:00.16 --> 01:45:04.32
get tested. And then some crazy stuff was going to happen. It's going to be mayhem. It's how we get

994
01:45:04.32 --> 01:45:09.52
guys ready for combat. The technical training of the soldiers, not the most difficult. It is

995
01:45:09.52 --> 01:45:13.68
necessary for him to know how to use and take care of his weapon to know how to move the right

996
01:45:13.68 --> 01:45:20.32
into the left forward and back. But this is not what makes a soldier. It's absolutely necessary to

997
01:45:20.32 --> 01:45:24.40
change the instruction. He's talking about how the instructions being run. He's talking how it should

998
01:45:24.40 --> 01:45:28.24
be run. He's absolutely necessary to change the instruction to reduce it to the necessary

999
01:45:28.24 --> 01:45:35.20
minimum and to cut out all sorts of super, superfluous information with which peacetime laborers

1000
01:45:35.20 --> 01:45:42.32
overloaded each year. To know the essential well is better than having some knowledge of a lot of

1001
01:45:42.32 --> 01:45:48.56
things. Many of them useless. Teach this in the first year. Then in the second, the essential.

1002
01:45:49.52 --> 01:45:55.44
Also instruction should be simple to avoid mental fatigue of long drills that discussed everybody.

1003
01:45:55.44 --> 01:46:03.28
So keep it simple. So that is the viewpoint on training. That is what you have to do.

1004
01:46:03.28 --> 01:46:12.96
Back to the book. When confidence is placed in superiority of material means,

1005
01:46:12.96 --> 01:46:18.64
valuable is they are against the enemy at a distance. It may be betrayed by the actions of the

1006
01:46:18.64 --> 01:46:25.60
enemy. If he closes with you in spite of your superiority, it means of destruction, the morale of the

1007
01:46:25.60 --> 01:46:32.88
enemy mounts with the loss of your confidence. His morale dominates yours. You flee entrenched

1008
01:46:32.88 --> 01:46:39.60
troops. Did you understand that? If you are stronger than me, but I attack you. You might just

1009
01:46:39.60 --> 01:46:44.96
get on your heels and lose. If you think about it, you see this in film footage in World War I.

1010
01:46:44.96 --> 01:46:48.48
People would take it. They would take the trenches. You are in a distance position. You have

1011
01:46:48.48 --> 01:46:51.84
got covered. You have got a consumer. You have got barbed wire, but someone still can come in.

1012
01:46:51.84 --> 01:46:58.16
When they do you run. You have seen those videos on YouTube with the squirrel attacks the dog.

1013
01:46:58.16 --> 01:47:03.76
But it is like this big dog. But the squirrel gets nuts. Is that a point?

1014
01:47:03.76 --> 01:47:07.76
They are squirrel getting nuts. You are getting a good with that one.

1015
01:47:09.76 --> 01:47:15.76
That was a chance. When you am out when you get nuts, you are getting nuts.

1016
01:47:15.76 --> 01:47:22.88
You are not. It is weird that we talk about that because I was talking about that.

1017
01:47:22.88 --> 01:47:28.48
When you are a kid, you see someone losing their temper. You see them getting nuts.

1018
01:47:28.48 --> 01:47:32.48
That is impressive. That is true. Somebody gets nuts.

1019
01:47:32.48 --> 01:47:35.28
If you are an experienced fighter, you see someone getting nuts.

1020
01:47:35.28 --> 01:47:38.80
You have got to get a winded about 35 more seconds.

1021
01:47:38.80 --> 01:47:43.44
Is that crazy? That is essentially a fight. He is trained.

1022
01:47:43.44 --> 01:47:46.88
He is trained. He is trained out of the human element.

1023
01:47:46.88 --> 01:47:48.48
He is talking about instinctual.

1024
01:47:48.48 --> 01:47:52.08
Good fighter. He is trained out of the human element.

1025
01:47:52.08 --> 01:47:54.08
That is exactly what happens with the training fighter.

1026
01:47:54.08 --> 01:48:00.08
But this shows you how that momentum and battle and business and anything.

1027
01:48:02.08 --> 01:48:04.08
How many attack you? You are stronger than me.

1028
01:48:04.08 --> 01:48:05.76
That is why it is aggressive.

1029
01:48:06.96 --> 01:48:09.12
Default mode is aggressive. That is why.

1030
01:48:10.32 --> 01:48:13.92
Even advancing, even by advancing you affect the morale of the enemy.

1031
01:48:13.92 --> 01:48:19.12
But your object is to dominate him and make him retreat before your ascendancy.

1032
01:48:19.12 --> 01:48:24.48
And it is certain that everything that diminishes the enemy's morale adds to your

1033
01:48:24.48 --> 01:48:28.80
resolution and advancing. So call on the attack. Be offensive. Be aggressive.

1034
01:48:31.12 --> 01:48:35.84
The mere attack does not completely succeed against such troops.

1035
01:48:35.84 --> 01:48:45.68
It is necessary to destroy them. Again, I always like to point that out because as we are

1036
01:48:45.68 --> 01:48:50.72
sitting here talking, we are even me. We are starting to think about chess game and video game

1037
01:48:50.72 --> 01:48:53.52
and all the stuff. But we are actually talking about killing everyone. That is what we are talking

1038
01:48:53.52 --> 01:49:01.20
about. We can't forget that. In modern battle, which is delivered with combatants so far apart,

1039
01:49:01.20 --> 01:49:06.56
man has come to have a horror of man. I thought that was interesting. We don't get this hand to hand

1040
01:49:06.56 --> 01:49:16.48
combat very much anymore. These are good. He, who calm and strong of heart awaits his enemy,

1041
01:49:16.48 --> 01:49:24.64
has all the advantage of fire. But the moral impulse of the assailant demoralizes the assailed.

1042
01:49:24.64 --> 01:49:29.44
He is frightened. He sets his sight no longer. His sight is no longer. He does not even aim as

1043
01:49:29.44 --> 01:49:34.16
peace. His lines are broken. So again, you are comfortable spot. This would happen to the Japanese.

1044
01:49:34.16 --> 01:49:42.16
So the island advancing campaigns. They are bunkers down in a bunker with thousands of rounds of

1045
01:49:42.16 --> 01:49:48.88
ammunition. And what do they see? They see United States Marine Corps coming across the beach.

1046
01:49:48.88 --> 01:49:54.72
And they go, oh my god, who are these guys and why are they not backing down? And they got frazzled.

1047
01:49:54.72 --> 01:50:01.28
Got overrun. With good troops on both sides, if an attack is not prepared, there is every

1048
01:50:01.28 --> 01:50:05.20
reason to believe that it will fail. So this is so, this is where we're going back and forth.

1049
01:50:05.20 --> 01:50:08.000
It's like each one is contrary to the other one. So he's saying, hey, if you're attacking

1050
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.16
you're going to win. But now he's saying with good troops on both sides, if an attack is not prepared,

1051
01:50:12.16 --> 01:50:17.68
there's every reason to believe it will fail. That's because the guys that are waiting the attack

1052
01:50:17.68 --> 01:50:21.60
have such an advantage. They're dug in. They're covered. They're, you know, the again. Look at

1053
01:50:21.60 --> 01:50:29.04
the Japanese. They're, they're in a bunker. The Marine is on a beach, bro. You can't get any more

1054
01:50:29.04 --> 01:50:35.44
exposed. Your weapon is wet. You're falling in the water. It's a horrible situation. We won every

1055
01:50:35.44 --> 01:50:41.28
single time. That's amazing. He's kind of talking about all other things being equal. Yeah,

1056
01:50:41.28 --> 01:50:45.52
saying other things being equal. If the attack is not prepared, there is every reason to believe

1057
01:50:45.52 --> 01:50:50.88
that it will fail. The attacking troops suffer more, materialy, materialy than the defenders.

1058
01:50:50.88 --> 01:50:56.08
The latter are in better order, fresh while the salons are in disorder, having suffered a bunch

1059
01:50:56.08 --> 01:51:01.84
of losses and a certain amount of punishment. And be clearly, again, we're going across the beach,

1060
01:51:01.84 --> 01:51:07.36
any beach, and fabulous invasion. Here taking losses, your disorder, debotes are crashing,

1061
01:51:07.36 --> 01:51:10.72
you're coming through the water. People are drowning. All that stuff is really happening.

1062
01:51:14.40 --> 01:51:19.04
The slightest, this is important. The slightest reaction by the defense

1063
01:51:19.04 --> 01:51:24.48
made demoralized the attack. So you see that, again, see someone in a street fight,

1064
01:51:25.04 --> 01:51:28.48
coming up and getting in your face and you just like, like, oh, really, you want something,

1065
01:51:28.48 --> 01:51:33.44
immediately will demoralize the attack. Never mind, you know, you, you hit them or you choke them,

1066
01:51:34.32 --> 01:51:38.56
because then now you're in a fight. But if you just, little thing made demoralized the attack,

1067
01:51:39.84 --> 01:51:44.56
and that's why you know, in a we-trained, when we get attacked, we attack. If you shoot

1068
01:51:44.56 --> 01:51:50.80
it us, you're going to feel the heat. The more confidence one has in his method of attack or

1069
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:56.80
defense, the more disc-inserted he is to see them at some time incapable of stopping the enemy.

1070
01:51:56.80 --> 01:52:00.16
So that's another thing. You think you're all strong, but then when you start getting beat, you just

1071
01:52:00.16 --> 01:52:12.64
fold. Fold. Interesting, just a quick comment. Back to the book, there was always mad

1072
01:52:12.64 --> 01:52:18.96
in patience for results without considering the means. So you see this a lot in businesses,

1073
01:52:19.68 --> 01:52:25.44
in the military, where the senior leadership, they want to see the results, we want results on

1074
01:52:25.44 --> 01:52:30.56
this thing, the kind of patient. Because the whole time you're asking that, if I start asking

1075
01:52:30.56 --> 01:52:34.40
you echo, how do we do this, how do we do this, how are we doing right now? You start going,

1076
01:52:34.40 --> 01:52:39.04
well, maybe I'm failing because I'm not getting any results here. If I, you know, I need to give you

1077
01:52:39.04 --> 01:52:47.92
some space and give you some time to let things develop and let you succeed. With us, very few

1078
01:52:48.72 --> 01:52:57.20
reason or understand reason, very few are cool. So again, human nature, if you only, this is important,

1079
01:52:57.60 --> 01:53:04.16
this is very important. If you only use combat methods that require leaders without fear of high

1080
01:53:04.16 --> 01:53:10.88
intelligence, full of good sense and of a spree, you always make mistakes. So you got to plan

1081
01:53:10.88 --> 01:53:19.84
your plan that it suits the, maybe the less superior leader that you might have. Man is always

1082
01:53:19.84 --> 01:53:25.76
man. He does not always possess ability and resolution. The commander must make his choice of methods

1083
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:36.32
depending on the troops and on himself. Pride generally causes refusal to acknowledge the truth

1084
01:53:36.32 --> 01:53:45.28
that fear of being vanquished is basic in war. In the mass, pride, vanity, in the mass, pride,

1085
01:53:45.28 --> 01:53:51.68
vanity is responsible for this dissimulation. With a tiny number of absolutely fearless men,

1086
01:53:51.68 --> 01:53:58.32
what is responsible is their ignorance of a thing they do not feel. Feel. There is, however,

1087
01:53:58.32 --> 01:54:04.24
no real basis for this and all real tactics are based upon it. Discipline is a part of taxes.

1088
01:54:04.24 --> 01:54:14.48
Tactics is absolutely at the base of tactics as a Roman showed. So discipline is more important than,

1089
01:54:14.88 --> 01:54:20.32
hey, we're just going to be brave. It's not going to work out for you. I'm not going to work out for you.

1090
01:54:20.32 --> 01:54:32.88
Very well. I had a, we were just got to a body and I pulled the officers in to,

1091
01:54:33.52 --> 01:54:37.44
there's actually the radio room where we had radios. I just want to talk to the officers.

1092
01:54:38.48 --> 01:54:42.32
And I said, hey, guys, look, we're going to be a long deployment. It's going to be rough.

1093
01:54:42.32 --> 01:54:48.88
And we got to pay attention to guys that get combat fatigue and it's going to get, you know,

1094
01:54:48.88 --> 01:54:52.96
guys will get scared and it's going to break them down and all that. And one of the junior officers

1095
01:54:54.16 --> 01:55:01.52
was, he said, he literally did not believe me. He was like, that's, he said, that's not going to happen to

1096
01:55:01.52 --> 01:55:07.04
our guys because we had a bunch of, you know, bad ass studs because that's not going to happen to our

1097
01:55:07.04 --> 01:55:10.72
guys. So we don't need, we don't need, we don't need to worry about that. I said, okay, well, I hope you're

1098
01:55:10.72 --> 01:55:16.72
right. And then about two months. You were right about that. And I said, yeah, I know, but you know,

1099
01:55:16.72 --> 01:55:20.48
so let's find out who we got to take care of, get them some rest or whatever or do our best.

1100
01:55:24.40 --> 01:55:30.40
Back to the book. Our infantry no longer has any battle tactics. The initiative of the soldier rules

1101
01:55:31.28 --> 01:55:37.36
the soldiers of the first empire trusted to the moral and passive action of masses. Today,

1102
01:55:37.36 --> 01:55:43.36
the soldiers object to the passive action of masses. They fight as skirmishes or they march back to the

1103
01:55:43.36 --> 01:55:50.40
front as a flock of sheep of which three fourths seek cover and route if the fire is heavy. So you

1104
01:55:50.40 --> 01:55:53.84
think you're going to, we'll just march the front. No, three quarters of your guys are going to not make it.

1105
01:55:53.84 --> 01:55:59.52
Not going to make it to the front. Manuver is possible only with good organization. Otherwise is

1106
01:55:59.52 --> 01:56:06.96
no more effective than the passive mass of rat of rabble in an attack. In ancient combat,

1107
01:56:06.96 --> 01:56:12.40
the soldier was controlled by the leader in engagements. Now that fighting is open, the soldier cannot be

1108
01:56:12.40 --> 01:56:21.28
controlled. Once, often, he cannot even be directed. Constquently, it is necessary to begin action

1109
01:56:21.28 --> 01:56:26.96
at the latest possible moment and to have the immediate commanders understand what is wanted

1110
01:56:26.96 --> 01:56:35.44
and what their objectives are. Descentualized command. Obviously, self esteem is quite

1111
01:56:35.44 --> 01:56:40.88
unquestionably one of the most powerful motives which moves our men. They do not wish to pass

1112
01:56:40.88 --> 01:56:45.28
for cowards in the eyes of our comrades. If they march forward, they want to distinguish themselves.

1113
01:56:46.56 --> 01:56:52.88
After every attack formation, no longer exists. This is because of the inherent disorder of

1114
01:56:52.88 --> 01:56:58.96
every forward march under fire. The bewildered men, evening officers, have no longer the eyes of

1115
01:56:58.96 --> 01:57:06.40
their comrades or of their commander upon them, sustaining them. Self esteem, no longer impels them.

1116
01:57:06.40 --> 01:57:16.08
They do not hold out the least counteroffensive puts them throughout. Just talking about being

1117
01:57:16.08 --> 01:57:21.44
separated and how before we had everyone watching us, no one was watching me. I guess what,

1118
01:57:21.44 --> 01:57:32.72
I'm going to take a little cover over here in this trench. Do you object that no one ever gets

1119
01:57:32.72 --> 01:57:38.80
within 200 meters of the enemy? That a unit attacking from the front never succeeds. So be it.

1120
01:57:39.60 --> 01:57:49.68
Let us attack from the flank. No, this is important. This is important. The combat. No

1121
01:57:49.68 --> 01:57:54.72
prescribed interval will be kept exactly. It will open. It will close following the fluctuations

1122
01:57:54.72 --> 01:58:00.72
of combat. And this is true with any plan. Business plan. It's not going to be what you thought

1123
01:58:00.72 --> 01:58:04.24
it was going to be. It's not going to go as planned. There's going to be fluctuations in what

1124
01:58:04.24 --> 01:58:07.36
you told people to do. They got to be ready for that. You got to be ready for that.

1125
01:58:12.32 --> 01:58:24.000
I love this one. Absolute rules are foolish. Absolute rules are foolish.

1126
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:34.64
About it. If you find yourself saying never or saying always, you better put a caveat on that.

1127
01:58:35.52 --> 01:58:42.000
Those are too strong. There's no such thing. With this very rare. Actually, I'd say there's no such thing.

1128
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.40
Maybe I could think of an example. But I'm sure there's an exception there to that.

1129
01:58:46.40 --> 01:58:49.36
Yeah, even to the one that I could think of. There's going to be an exception.

1130
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:56.000
Yeah. This is cool. The infantry square is not a thing of mechanics of mathematical reasons.

1131
01:58:56.56 --> 01:59:00.48
So the infantry square was attacked. They used any here. They'll tell how they formed up.

1132
01:59:00.48 --> 01:59:05.36
Uplatoon in four ranks, two facing the front to the rear. It's flanks guarded by the extreme

1133
01:59:05.36 --> 01:59:11.12
files that face to the flank and conducted supported by non-commissioned officers placed in a fifth

1134
01:59:11.12 --> 01:59:17.84
rank in the interior of the rectangle. Powerful in its competence and fire cannot be dislodged by

1135
01:59:17.84 --> 01:59:27.28
cavalry. So he's talking about this infantry square and why it's such a good tactic. Why?

1136
01:59:28.96 --> 01:59:36.32
Moly reasons. And no others make the soldier in a square, feel himself stronger than wind in the line.

1137
01:59:36.32 --> 01:59:41.28
He feels himself watched from behind and has no one. Where to fly. So you might think like,

1138
01:59:41.28 --> 01:59:45.60
well, they got goods 360 security and that's why it's good or without their, you know, unit that's

1139
01:59:45.60 --> 01:59:49.68
easy to control. What it is is, hey, when I'm in the square, I know someone's got my back. I know someone's

1140
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:53.84
got my flank. And I know that their people are watching me and counting on me. So we, I got to fight

1141
01:59:53.84 --> 02:00:02.88
hard. That's why the infantry square worked really well. Fire by command presupposes an impossible

1142
02:00:02.88 --> 02:00:09.04
coolness. Had any troops ever possessed it, they would have mode down battalions as one

1143
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:13.12
most down course, cornstarch. So he's saying, look, this idea that you're just going to tell him

1144
02:00:13.12 --> 02:00:18.64
to get online online coming on shoot. No, they need to have freedom and the only thing that creates

1145
02:00:18.64 --> 02:00:25.76
communist under fire is security. Security, just like a quarter back, what's going to make him calm

1146
02:00:25.76 --> 02:00:32.000
under fires when he has good defensive people keeping the, oh, line, the old line keeping the,

1147
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.52
the, what the defensive line at bay. It's going to keep him cool. I mean, obviously some guys get pretty

1148
02:00:37.52 --> 02:00:42.88
cool under some pressure. Not as cool as they are when they got a good line just holding the line.

1149
02:00:46.56 --> 02:00:51.76
As always, I'm sorry, always, always take draconian measures to prevent

1150
02:00:51.76 --> 02:00:57.04
pillage from commencing. If it begins, it is difficult ever to stop it. So you got to keep

1151
02:00:57.04 --> 02:01:04.08
it get a hold of line. Keep your troops disciplined. Here's a little dichotomy of leadership coming

1152
02:01:04.08 --> 02:01:13.44
at you. A leader must combine resolute bravery and impetuosity with prudence and calmness,

1153
02:01:13.44 --> 02:01:21.52
a difficult matter. That's the dichotomy of leadership. You got to be calm,

1154
02:01:21.52 --> 02:01:28.16
but you got to be brave. You got to be prudent with what you're doing, but you're at the same time.

1155
02:01:28.16 --> 02:01:39.12
You got to be a little bit rationed. Be aggressive. Good times. Okay. He lays out a little information here

1156
02:01:40.08 --> 02:01:47.52
about generals, like being in high command. So when you're, as we're talking about CEOs,

1157
02:01:47.52 --> 02:01:53.68
we're talking about senior leadership. When one occupies a high command, there are many things

1158
02:01:53.68 --> 02:02:00.48
which he does not see. The general and chief, even a division commander can only escape this

1159
02:02:00.48 --> 02:02:06.56
failing by great activity, moved by strict conscientiousness and aided by clairvoyance.

1160
02:02:07.28 --> 02:02:11.12
Do you have to be able to like see? You have to have a clairvoyant skills.

1161
02:02:11.76 --> 02:02:16.32
This failing extends to those about him to his heads of services. So you're the CEO.

1162
02:02:16.32 --> 02:02:19.92
You're not going to know everything that's going on. The only way you do, you do know what's

1163
02:02:19.92 --> 02:02:24.000
going on is by being really proactive and finding out what's going on. And by the way, it's not just you that

1164
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.84
doesn't know all your little, all your other people in the C-suite, they don't know what's going on either.

1165
02:02:27.84 --> 02:02:34.08
You lose a lot of that stuff unless you're super proactive. Now here's some examples. These men live well,

1166
02:02:34.08 --> 02:02:42.08
sleep well. The same must be true of all. They have picked well-conditioned horses. The roads are excellent.

1167
02:02:42.08 --> 02:02:47.04
They are never sick. The doctors must be exaggerating sickness. They have attendance and doctors.

1168
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:54.48
Everybody must be well-looked after. Something happens which shows a bombadable negligence,

1169
02:02:54.48 --> 02:03:01.60
common enough in the war with a good heart and a full belly they say. But this is infamous,

1170
02:03:01.60 --> 02:03:07.52
unheard of. It could not have happened. It is impossible. So you gotta be careful of that detachment.

1171
02:03:07.52 --> 02:03:10.80
When you get to the senior leadership positions, when you start going out of those guys in the front

1172
02:03:10.80 --> 02:03:15.52
ones, what's wrong with it? What can they possibly be complaining about? You can't be that

1173
02:03:15.52 --> 02:03:20.72
bad about out there. Actually, it can. Now we'll talk about a little micro management.

1174
02:03:20.72 --> 02:03:26.24
Back to the book today, there is a tendency whose cause should be sought on the part of

1175
02:03:26.24 --> 02:03:33.52
superiors to infringe on the authority of the infereers. This is general. It goes very

1176
02:03:33.52 --> 02:03:39.68
high and is further by the mania for command. Right? People don't want to be controlling everything.

1177
02:03:39.68 --> 02:03:47.28
It results in the lessening of the authority of subordinate officers in the minds of their soldiers.

1178
02:03:47.28 --> 02:03:51.04
So when you're micro managing, you're hurting the authority of your subordinate leadership.

1179
02:03:51.04 --> 02:03:56.32
This is a grave matter. As only the firm authority and prestige of subordinate officers can maintain

1180
02:03:56.32 --> 02:04:02.64
discipline. The tendency to oppress subordinates to want to impose upon them in all things,

1181
02:04:02.64 --> 02:04:08.56
the views of the superior, not to admit of honest mistakes. Right? We don't want to make

1182
02:04:08.56 --> 02:04:14.72
mistakes. We want to impose on them all things, the views of the superior, not to admit honest mistakes,

1183
02:04:15.76 --> 02:04:21.84
and to improve them as faults to make everybody even down to the private field that there is only

1184
02:04:21.84 --> 02:04:30.88
one infallible authority. And that's me. A criminal, for instance, sets himself up as the sole authority

1185
02:04:30.88 --> 02:04:35.84
with judgment and intelligence. He thus takes all initiative from subordinate officers and reduces

1186
02:04:35.84 --> 02:04:42.48
them to a state of inertia coming from their lack of confidence in themselves and from fear of being

1187
02:04:42.48 --> 02:04:49.68
severely reproved. How many generals before regimen think of, think only of showing how much they know?

1188
02:04:51.60 --> 02:04:57.28
Don't be that leader. They lessen the authority of the Colonel. That is nothing to them. They have

1189
02:04:57.28 --> 02:05:03.20
asserted their superiority. True or false, that is what is essential. With cheeks puffed out, they leave

1190
02:05:03.20 --> 02:05:14.64
proud of having attacked discipline. Really bothers me. But it's, you know, here we are, 1840. We're

1191
02:05:14.64 --> 02:05:23.92
talking, 1860. We're talking about micromanagement. We're talking about micromanagement. Right?

1192
02:05:23.92 --> 02:05:28.08
We're talking about the operational on, not knowing what's these problems that we deal with with

1193
02:05:28.08 --> 02:05:33.68
businesses all the time in echelon front. This is what we deal with. And it's hard for people to see

1194
02:05:33.68 --> 02:05:39.12
that they're doing this because they don't know it. Even though this is such a common trait

1195
02:05:39.12 --> 02:05:43.76
that we can go back thousands of years and see, people don't recognize it.

1196
02:05:46.80 --> 02:05:52.80
Well, this one bothers me. Ask much in order to attain obtain a little. Is a false saying.

1197
02:05:52.80 --> 02:06:01.36
A source of errors and attack on discipline. One, two obtain what one asks. It is only necessary

1198
02:06:01.36 --> 02:06:06.72
to be moderately reasonable and practical. So this is like, hey, echelon, we need to sell 10,000

1199
02:06:06.72 --> 02:06:14.24
of these new units we've made. And what I'm really hoping is that you sell a thousand. That's not,

1200
02:06:14.24 --> 02:06:17.36
well, that's not a good way to do. If I want you to sell a thousand, that's what I want you to

1201
02:06:17.36 --> 02:06:21.36
make. You know, I want you to make a thousand of these new units. Okay, make a thousand. I don't

1202
02:06:21.36 --> 02:06:25.92
tell you make 10,000 in hope that you can know. I think it's a disaster. Don't do that.

1203
02:06:28.40 --> 02:06:33.20
Man's admiration for the great spectacles of nature is the admiration for force.

1204
02:06:34.56 --> 02:06:38.96
Again, we're getting a little bit of human nature. It's a little touch. In the mountains,

1205
02:06:38.96 --> 02:06:43.92
it is mass a force that impresses him, strikes him, makes him admire. In the calm,

1206
02:06:43.92 --> 02:06:51.12
see it is the mysterious and terrible force that he defines. That he feels in that enormous

1207
02:06:51.12 --> 02:06:57.20
liquid mass in the angry sea force. Again, in the wind and the storm and the vast depths of the

1208
02:06:57.20 --> 02:07:04.56
sky, it is still force that he admires. All these things astounded man when he was young when he

1209
02:07:04.56 --> 02:07:11.20
became old, he knows them. A astonishment has turned to admiration, but always it is the feeling of

1210
02:07:11.20 --> 02:07:18.56
a formidable force which compels his admiration. This explains his admiration for the warrior.

1211
02:07:18.56 --> 02:07:29.28
The warrior is the ideal of primitive man, the savage, the barbarian. The more people rise in moral

1212
02:07:29.28 --> 02:07:37.36
civilization, the lower this ideal falls. But the masses everywhere, the warrior still is and for a

1213
02:07:37.36 --> 02:07:45.84
long time will be the heights of their ideals. This began because man loves to admire force and

1214
02:07:45.84 --> 02:07:54.56
bravery that are his own attributes. When that force and bravery find another means to assert themselves

1215
02:07:54.56 --> 02:08:00.08
at least when the crowd is shown that war does not furnish the best examples of them,

1216
02:08:00.96 --> 02:08:07.04
that there are true and more exalted examples. This ideal will give way to a higher one.

1217
02:08:07.04 --> 02:08:26.56
Don't think it's quite apt yet. The only method of fire to be used in war is fire at will.

1218
02:08:26.56 --> 02:08:39.60
When you're trying to control your teams and their every action, that's the action of a soldier.

1219
02:08:39.60 --> 02:08:46.72
It's the fire. When you're trying to control that you are micro managing. In many cases,

1220
02:08:46.72 --> 02:08:58.32
you let them operate on their own. Now I'm going to close out this piece of battle studies right

1221
02:08:58.32 --> 02:09:07.92
here for going to August 15th, 1870. This is about in the first month of the Franco-Prussian war,

1222
02:09:07.92 --> 02:09:19.28
Colonel DePique was with his regiment. On the outskirts of a town called Mars Latour in France,

1223
02:09:20.24 --> 02:09:31.44
and they started to receive artillery fire and this section or this quote is from the history

1224
02:09:31.44 --> 02:09:38.40
of France's 10th Infantry Regiment. They started taking some shelling and here we go. The Colonel

1225
02:09:38.40 --> 02:09:44.40
had arms taken at once and disposed the regiment north of the road which being elevated provided

1226
02:09:44.40 --> 02:09:51.20
sufficient cover for the men. He himself stood in the road to put heart into his troops by his

1227
02:09:51.20 --> 02:09:57.12
attitude. They having been a little startled by the surprise and the baptism of fire which they

1228
02:09:57.12 --> 02:10:05.12
received under such disadventages circumstances. Suddenly a shell burst over the road, a few feet

1229
02:10:05.12 --> 02:10:12.64
from the Colonel and mutilated his legs in a frightful manner. The shell caused other ravages

1230
02:10:12.64 --> 02:10:19.68
in the ranks of the 10th. The commander of third battalion, Major D'ShaNays, was mortally wounded.

1231
02:10:20.48 --> 02:10:25.92
Captain Ray Bole was killed. Lieutenant Pone, third battalion, first company,

1232
02:10:25.92 --> 02:10:32.88
and eight men of the regiment were wounded. The Colonel was immediately taken to the other side of

1233
02:10:32.88 --> 02:10:39.76
the highway into the midst of the soldiers and a surgeon called those of the regiment already being

1234
02:10:39.76 --> 02:10:47.28
engaged in caring for the other victims of the terrible shot. In the meantime, Colonel D'Pique asked

1235
02:10:47.28 --> 02:10:53.92
for Lieutenant Colonel Dolyak delivered to him his saddlebags containing important papers concerning

1236
02:10:53.92 --> 02:11:01.04
the regiment and gave him his field glasses. Then without uttering the least sound of pain not

1237
02:11:01.04 --> 02:11:06.32
with standing the frightful injury from which he must have suffered horribly, he said with calmness,

1238
02:11:07.60 --> 02:11:13.84
my regret is to be struck this way without having been able to lead my regiment on the enemy.

1239
02:11:15.60 --> 02:11:19.44
They wanted him to take a little brandy. He refused and accepted some water,

1240
02:11:19.44 --> 02:11:26.72
which a soldier offered him. A surgeon finally arrived. The Colonel showing him his right leg

1241
02:11:27.28 --> 02:11:32.32
opened in two places, made with his hand the sign of amputating at his thigh saying,

1242
02:11:32.32 --> 02:11:40.48
Dr. It is necessary to amputate my leg here. At this moment, a soldier wounded in the soldier

1243
02:11:40.48 --> 02:11:46.88
in the shoulder placed near the Colonel, grown to loud. For getting his own condition,

1244
02:11:46.88 --> 02:11:51.76
the Colonel said immediately to the surgeon, see first doctor, what is the matter with this brave

1245
02:11:51.76 --> 02:11:59.04
man? I can wait. Because of the lack of instruments, it was not possible to perform the

1246
02:11:59.04 --> 02:12:04.80
amputation on the ground as the Colonel desired, so this much deplored commander was transported

1247
02:12:04.80 --> 02:12:14.24
to the Met's hospital. Four days later, on the 19th of August, Colonel Arden, D'Pique,

1248
02:12:14.24 --> 02:12:25.76
died like a hero of old, without uttering the least complaint. Far from his regiment,

1249
02:12:26.64 --> 02:12:32.72
far from his family, he uttered several times the words which summed up his affections.

1250
02:12:32.72 --> 02:12:48.80
My wife, my children, my regiment, my wife, my children, my regiment, had your goodbye.

1251
02:12:48.80 --> 02:13:17.04
And so, we see a man who despite his intimate knowledge of the fear and the immense strength

1252
02:13:18.88 --> 02:13:25.92
that the instincts of self-preservation hold yet, he showed no fear. And overcame his own

1253
02:13:25.92 --> 02:13:37.44
instincts of self-preservation. And maybe, maybe that's because he knew them so well.

1254
02:13:37.44 --> 02:13:46.32
He understood them so deeply that he was able to overcome them.

1255
02:13:50.32 --> 02:14:00.08
And maybe of all the incredible lessons we can learn for Colonel, to Pique, perhaps the most

1256
02:14:00.08 --> 02:14:07.84
important one is for us to realize why it is still critical for us to increase our knowledge.

1257
02:14:08.48 --> 02:14:20.40
Not just of war, but of all things. So that we have the knowledge and the understanding

1258
02:14:20.40 --> 02:14:33.92
to confront and overcome those things, the good and the bad. So, learn.

1259
02:14:37.04 --> 02:14:42.40
Learn about your strengths and your weaknesses, learn about strategy and tactics,

1260
02:14:42.40 --> 02:14:55.04
learn about fear and hesitation, learn about human nature. And learn about yourself.

1261
02:14:55.04 --> 02:15:10.16
Test yourself. Find out who you are. Find out where fear and hesitation might cause you

1262
02:15:10.16 --> 02:15:26.88
to back down or fall short. Learn and understand yourself so you can overcome and conquer

1263
02:15:26.88 --> 02:15:36.88
the limitations of your natural instincts and replace them with the will and the discipline

1264
02:15:36.88 --> 02:15:45.28
to overpower and overcome everything in your path.

1265
02:15:50.72 --> 02:15:57.44
And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So,

1266
02:15:57.44 --> 02:16:06.96
I go Charles. Speaking of learning and gaining knowledge,

1267
02:16:09.20 --> 02:16:14.56
maybe you could convey some knowledge on how to support this podcast. Time for support.

1268
02:16:14.56 --> 02:16:18.96
Sure. Of course. I feel like we should start with on it.

1269
02:16:18.96 --> 02:16:27.20
Good places. Don't break the cycle, the routine, the ritual, the fuel. So, on it, best supplements in

1270
02:16:27.20 --> 02:16:34.40
the straight up in the world. You call that, huh? Yeah. Browse is funny. Like I sound kind of sick.

1271
02:16:34.40 --> 02:16:39.76
I was like, talk last week and I'm all talking. You know, you're trying to not be sick. Remember?

1272
02:16:39.76 --> 02:16:42.80
I think you're thinking of getting sick. Yes. Guess what I did.

1273
02:16:42.80 --> 02:16:48.08
Sure. I'm taking you on boom. Or did it? Yeah. You gotta have that stuff on standby. Do you know

1274
02:16:48.08 --> 02:16:52.72
where you can feel when you're getting sick? Yeah. I totally deserved it. Just how actually

1275
02:16:52.72 --> 02:16:56.56
I didn't really say anything bad. But I deserve it. Oh, so you are deep inside. You're looking

1276
02:16:56.56 --> 02:17:03.60
to be a weakness. No. Yeah. Oh, no. I was more like, because I hadn't bought it yet. You know,

1277
02:17:03.60 --> 02:17:11.12
we knew who was there. We were like, sure. I'm not sick. But then again, once you're sick,

1278
02:17:11.12 --> 02:17:15.92
it's kind of too late. You don't kind of, anyway, nonetheless. Lesson learned. Shroom taking

1279
02:17:15.92 --> 02:17:22.000
moon on the way for me. I, by the way, I didn't get sick. I just barely touched on getting sick.

1280
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.84
And I'd be, but, amped up the vitamin C, I amp up the shroom tech immune. That fires you up on

1281
02:17:27.84 --> 02:17:32.88
because it's like a little battle. Yeah. Yeah. It's a battle. It is. The morale was high after that one.

1282
02:17:32.88 --> 02:17:39.92
Yeah. I flanked them. I flanked them with the shroom tech immune. Yeah. Big turn. But yeah. So, to kind of

1283
02:17:39.92 --> 02:17:45.76
go down the list. And I think this is important. People ask me, and not to kind of like,

1284
02:17:45.76 --> 02:17:49.12
how I say, you know, a few people. So, people been asking me, and it's like two people,

1285
02:17:49.84 --> 02:17:55.04
their mom, and then their neighbor, or something, your brother. Yeah. And it's like, all people,

1286
02:17:55.04 --> 02:17:58.88
then it, and I was actually talking to my brother about this because he said that to you. He was like,

1287
02:17:58.88 --> 02:18:03.76
all people been asking me this. And then I was like, teasing a monster. Oh, yeah. Two people asked

1288
02:18:03.76 --> 02:18:08.72
you and you're like, but he was a thing. Let's say three people ask you the exact same question in

1289
02:18:08.72 --> 02:18:12.16
like three days. That's one person today. That's not very much. But if they're asking the same

1290
02:18:12.16 --> 02:18:17.84
question, that's a lot of people asking you. Really? Feels like it. Okay. Anyway, so a lot of people

1291
02:18:17.84 --> 02:18:23.44
have been asking me. People in that question, you know, three of them is on it stuff for real,

1292
02:18:23.44 --> 02:18:30.40
is that for real good, you know, and what do you take? So, here it is. If you didn't already.

1293
02:18:30.40 --> 02:18:38.56
Officially on what do you say on the roster, right on the everyday consumption or whatever. See,

1294
02:18:40.56 --> 02:18:45.52
I have on it total strength and performance. That's not every day. That's only when I do

1295
02:18:45.52 --> 02:18:52.72
met constant work out. Sometimes I'll use it for GJ2. Yeah. Stream tech. He's stream tech. The other day

1296
02:18:52.72 --> 02:19:00.88
for GJ2 reminded me of why I used it before it was good. What did the advantage? I'm not going to tell you.

1297
02:19:00.88 --> 02:19:07.68
Because I didn't notice any. It wasn't the other day. Yeah, it was the other day. Yeah.

1298
02:19:08.72 --> 02:19:11.92
But we didn't really roll hard because you were taking the easy on my rib and I think you

1299
02:19:11.92 --> 02:19:16.56
did. I'd be here. Yeah. But I didn't feel tired. Like it wasn't. It was good. Anyway, so

1300
02:19:16.56 --> 02:19:23.52
soon total performance and strict total strength and performance. Stream tech as needed. That's for like,

1301
02:19:23.52 --> 02:19:30.16
you know, hard output, sustained stuff. GJ2 rounds, met cons. If you're into CrossFit,

1302
02:19:31.20 --> 02:19:35.84
take that stream tech. Get you right through it. Keep you in the in the green. Maybe in the yellow.

1303
02:19:35.84 --> 02:19:44.40
Maybe. And then, acrylic oil. Of course daily daily. Essential. You like the strong bone, right?

1304
02:19:44.40 --> 02:19:51.04
This is for joints. You get these joint. You know, I refer a lot of stuff back to GJ2 because

1305
02:19:51.04 --> 02:19:58.08
GJ2 is like a sustained stream tech. It can mess with you. If you're getting after it,

1306
02:19:58.08 --> 02:20:02.88
five days a week in GJ2, even three sometimes. If you're not used to it, you take the

1307
02:20:02.88 --> 02:20:14.48
acrylic oil. Take your right up. Yeah. Krill oil. I got the gourmet peanut by it's not peanut but

1308
02:20:14.48 --> 02:20:20.32
it's like cash you. I mean, you know, it's a try. Blend butter. No one's good. You like that one? Yeah,

1309
02:20:20.32 --> 02:20:24.24
yeah, it's more as well. And where are your parts? For sure. Where not going trips,

1310
02:20:24.24 --> 02:20:28.96
not a speaking companies or work with companies. A lot of them in their little snack area.

1311
02:20:28.96 --> 02:20:33.52
Yeah, more of your parts. No butterware bars. Then the no. Yeah, it's good. So good though.

1312
02:20:33.52 --> 02:20:38.72
Yeah, what are they going to do? Put down on the other town for me. I'll strain the roof. Yeah. And oh no, no,

1313
02:20:38.72 --> 02:20:47.52
don't. It's, it's, on it is interesting in that way. I don't know how much you browse the website,

1314
02:20:47.52 --> 02:20:53.76
but when I'll go in there, I'll browse it. This is the, like, I'm not going to buy women's

1315
02:20:53.76 --> 02:21:00.000
t-shirts for myself, you know, but I'll just browse this distance. Oh, you're so

1316
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.20
read about the women's. Yeah, well, not, not necessarily women's, but I'm just saying,

1317
02:21:03.20 --> 02:21:08.16
even if I'm not going to work it for some stuff, oh, look. And they have all kinds of new stuff.

1318
02:21:08.16 --> 02:21:12.16
Like, um, you know, obviously protein powder and stuff, but they'll have like wellness stuff

1319
02:21:12.16 --> 02:21:16.80
though, uh, multi-bite, but they have toothpaste. Oh, I didn't know that. Deodorant? Yeah.

1320
02:21:16.80 --> 02:21:20.72
Interesting. I'm not saying get the toothpaste in the other end. I'm just saying it's interesting

1321
02:21:20.72 --> 02:21:25.20
how much new stuff they're always like coming out with. Oh, and I forgot to say the kettlebells

1322
02:21:25.20 --> 02:21:32.72
that they have. All up on those. Primal? Bells? Legend. Bells. Legend. Bells. And then there's zombie bells.

1323
02:21:32.72 --> 02:21:36.24
That's what I think zombie bells. Yeah. Because I want something that looks, you know,

1324
02:21:36.24 --> 02:21:43.04
just stirring and crazy. How much is the, um, or how much does it weigh? What I have the 40k

1325
02:21:43.04 --> 02:21:50.88
to hang the 80 something, Palmo. Yeah. Dang. That's good. I have the wearable one, two wearable

1326
02:21:50.88 --> 02:21:56.48
ones. Those are like 62 pounds. I keep the zombie bell in the house. Oh, it's like aesthetic.

1327
02:21:56.48 --> 02:22:02.08
No, no. Oh, you need jump on it. So I think it's because in my garage, I got bunch of kettlebells,

1328
02:22:02.08 --> 02:22:07.60
but those are all older than on it, right? But in my house, I got the, the boom, the zombie bell.

1329
02:22:07.60 --> 02:22:11.28
Yeah. Because I, where you just hit a couple snatches, you will wake up. Yeah. Yeah.

1330
02:22:11.28 --> 02:22:14.80
Hit a couple snatches, hit a couple swings, you're going to go. Do you do the one where you go?

1331
02:22:14.80 --> 02:22:19.04
Yeah. I'm in hits the back here. Yeah. You got to get used to that. You got to jump into that.

1332
02:22:19.04 --> 02:22:23.92
But yeah, there's some reason you notice it when you first start kettlebells, but you don't notice it after a while.

1333
02:22:23.92 --> 02:22:28.80
Yeah. Just, well, you're not ready for the whole. You know what you know what you do is you use your grip. At least I do.

1334
02:22:28.80 --> 02:22:32.80
I use my grip to like slow it down a little bit. Yeah. There's a little bit of friction there.

1335
02:22:32.80 --> 02:22:37.60
Right. I get down to get a little softer landing on there. Dang. Yeah. That's a good idea.

1336
02:22:37.60 --> 02:22:43.28
So you can use the zombie bells kind of like your, you know, how some guys I think it was you.

1337
02:22:43.28 --> 02:22:48.000
It's telling me you have two gays. You have one gig. You never really use unless it's like picture taking time.

1338
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
That's not me.

1339
02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:50.88
That's not me.

1340
02:22:50.88 --> 02:22:54.72
That is called the Hollywood. That wasn't you. The Hollywood gig and the action gig.

1341
02:22:54.72 --> 02:22:59.52
Absolutely not. The Hollywood gig is like, it's, it's a legit gig. Like most gays are.

1342
02:22:59.52 --> 02:23:03.60
You can roll in them, but you do kind of keep it, you know, in the closet, how

1343
02:23:03.60 --> 02:23:10.000
up. When it's easy to roll up, you do know me at all. I thought it was you long time. Maybe you changed.

1344
02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.40
I don't know. I didn't change nonetheless. If I feel like he is going to get rolled in.

1345
02:23:15.12 --> 02:23:19.60
Dig it, fed. I did it. Otherwise, why would I have it? Yeah. Oh, that's right.

1346
02:23:19.60 --> 02:23:22.56
Take pictures and no. Next question.

1347
02:23:22.56 --> 02:23:27.52
Whatever. Oh, by the way, Dr. Zinjitsu magazine taking pictures the other day. Yeah. I said it.

1348
02:23:27.52 --> 02:23:34.24
Yeah. Maybe on the cover. Maybe not. I don't know. Anyway, back to on it. We all know

1349
02:23:34.24 --> 02:23:37.84
okay, best supplement in the world. These are all the things. What they do. If you take a supplement

1350
02:23:37.84 --> 02:23:41.60
for something like from on it. You're still doing on it right now. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to continue

1351
02:23:41.60 --> 02:23:47.36
to do on it because it's working. This is valuable information. If I was on the other side of this,

1352
02:23:47.36 --> 02:23:51.20
I wouldn't hope that somebody told me this. Well, that is true. And I think like,

1353
02:23:51.20 --> 02:23:55.44
for instance, Kriloiol, you do not know about Kriloiol. Yeah. And now you know about Kriloiol. Yeah.

1354
02:23:55.44 --> 02:24:00.16
You are sore and getting old and decrepit. Boom. You started taking Kriloiol? Boom.

1355
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:04.000
Back in the game. Back in the game. Yeah. What's, what's good point? What's bad about taking

1356
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.40
Kriloiol though is I did my wife's dad, my father and I would always recruit Ruloiol's bed

1357
02:24:08.40 --> 02:24:13.20
in the fish oil and be like, whatever health. Not that you don't look to me. I left. Yeah. I got

1358
02:24:13.20 --> 02:24:18.08
a mid to it. Oh, good. Anyway, you know that the supplements you take from on it are going to work.

1359
02:24:18.08 --> 02:24:21.60
That's the good thing. And there's a bunch of cool stuff. Even in goes above and beyond supplements.

1360
02:24:21.60 --> 02:24:26.72
It's like the peanut butter. Yeah. But you said no. There's a lot of stuff. Yeah. I'm just a small reminder.

1361
02:24:26.72 --> 02:24:31.20
Oh, good. If you want 10% off though. Yes, that's it. That's the support part.

1362
02:24:32.64 --> 02:24:37.44
Support the podcast support yourself with the supplementation support the wallet with the 10% off.

1363
02:24:37.44 --> 02:24:42.64
Go on it.com slash. Joko. Boom. Boom. Another way to support Amazon click through.

1364
02:24:43.52 --> 02:24:48.48
It's a good way to support. And it's super easy. It takes no time. Before you do Amazon shopping, go to

1365
02:24:48.48 --> 02:24:54.32
website jokopodcast.com or on the side. Here's the thing too. If you have an ad blocker, it might block

1366
02:24:54.32 --> 02:24:59.12
these little banners there. Which is cool. That's a safe thing to do. You know, you block ads and

1367
02:24:59.12 --> 02:25:05.92
pop ups and whatnot. But know that this will happen most of the time. Most ad blockers. Anyway,

1368
02:25:07.12 --> 02:25:11.12
banner on the side. Good. Jokopodcast.com over on the side is a banner that Amazon clicked through that.

1369
02:25:11.12 --> 02:25:21.36
Then do your shopping. That helps. That supports a lot. Reinforcements. Another way. Subscribe to the podcast.

1370
02:25:21.36 --> 02:25:26.56
On iTunes. On Stitcher. If you haven't already. Do you want to have it said in the well? What review?

1371
02:25:27.20 --> 02:25:31.68
Yeah. Yeah. I got a review on there, man. I'll kick a review on there. Tell him what's up. And

1372
02:25:31.68 --> 02:25:38.24
there's been, hey, there was a review of jokopodt. Yeah. Have you read it? It's the best review of all time.

1373
02:25:38.24 --> 02:25:48.48
Yeah. And it's the basic theme is brew. Brew. Brew. Brew. Brew. Brew. Brewing up the tea again.

1374
02:25:48.48 --> 02:25:53.04
And it goes. Yeah. Yeah. And entire is the best review of all time. Yeah. I saw that.

1375
02:25:53.04 --> 02:26:00.24
I was so that is what I mean, just the best thing about that. When I read that, and of course,

1376
02:26:00.24 --> 02:26:05.76
I get it. But what I love about that is when I read stuff like that, I think about all the people

1377
02:26:05.76 --> 02:26:10.40
that that know nothing about anything that we're doing. And they just read that and say,

1378
02:26:10.40 --> 02:26:15.52
well, what do they think? Yeah. What is it going through their mind? So when everybody puts all these crazy

1379
02:26:15.52 --> 02:26:24.24
reviews on Amazon or on the podcast, I got to admit that I find them entertaining. Yeah. I would

1380
02:26:24.24 --> 02:26:31.36
think if you don't really know and you see just all the, the one thing that person could figure out.

1381
02:26:31.36 --> 02:26:36.96
That's what could they do? Yeah. They do like get after it. There's a lot of people say that.

1382
02:26:36.96 --> 02:26:43.20
They did. They did a lot of stuff that yeah. I read free people out. Yeah. No, but that would

1383
02:26:43.20 --> 02:26:48.88
at least make them think like, there's a lot to this thing. This thing is heavy. This isn't just

1384
02:26:48.88 --> 02:26:53.44
white tea or this isn't, you know, this is heavy. I got to look into that unless they're scared

1385
02:26:53.44 --> 02:26:58.56
or whatever, inhibited or that's not for me, which would be strange. But unless you have

1386
02:26:58.56 --> 02:27:03.12
you're in the mood, right, or review, you know, you're feeling creative, get creative, whatever.

1387
02:27:03.12 --> 02:27:07.12
Good. Yeah. You can get creative on all. You can get creative on it. Because the review is actually

1388
02:27:07.12 --> 02:27:11.76
help. That's the thing. Yeah. You know, you might think it doesn't mean anything, but A, we read them,

1389
02:27:11.76 --> 02:27:19.04
B, it helps. It helps. Like Amazon. It helps the ranking in Amazon. It helps the iTunes ranking for

1390
02:27:19.04 --> 02:27:23.76
sure. So that's cool. It's another good reason to do it. But mostly do it just to crack me up and

1391
02:27:23.76 --> 02:27:29.04
make people think that all of us are psycho. And express yourself. That's a good point too. So

1392
02:27:29.04 --> 02:27:38.08
no, I should read that through. Maybe if we ever do a commercial for Jockel, I think that's a good

1393
02:27:38.08 --> 02:27:47.68
thing. The chorus is there's no TV in the poor. So good. Yeah. That's awesome. All right. Very much.

1394
02:27:47.68 --> 02:27:54.32
So also subscribe on YouTube. We're putting on more videos, you know, which is pretty dope. It's pretty

1395
02:27:54.32 --> 02:28:00.000
dope. Sure. No videos to watch. You know, short. You got some in the hopper too, right? I got a

1396
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.40
feeling of hopper. Yeah. I have like three in the hopper, which is kind of different. Do you think you should

1397
02:28:04.40 --> 02:28:09.28
prioritize an execute? Yeah. Or do you just, do you just like creating three different things at the same

1398
02:28:09.28 --> 02:28:15.28
time? No, because a lot of time in this main may or may not be the most disciplined approach, but

1399
02:28:15.28 --> 02:28:21.12
I like kind of go with the wave. You know, so it's like, oh, man, this one really, like I'm feeling this

1400
02:28:21.12 --> 02:28:25.36
one, you know, so all let's make that one into a video. And I just start and then I'll get hit with

1401
02:28:25.36 --> 02:28:29.60
something else that you said or whatever. But all these artistic things you got going on in your mind.

1402
02:28:30.16 --> 02:28:34.72
Yeah. Actually I do that with books. This is, you know, I read a lot of books. And I will definitely

1403
02:28:36.24 --> 02:28:41.44
read a book. And if it's kind of slow moving, I'll read another book at the same time. And then when I get

1404
02:28:41.44 --> 02:28:44.56
bored, I want to start reading the other one to hop. I can have up to three books going at the same

1405
02:28:44.56 --> 02:28:50.000
time. Yeah. So that's actually not a bad idea. There you go. See, and mine is a lot like, I just

1406
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.84
figure if you reel into it, do it. It comes out like better. I don't know. Yeah. It's what it feels like,

1407
02:28:55.84 --> 02:28:59.92
you know, I'm going to stick with that for right now unless it, you know, produces roadblocks.

1408
02:28:59.92 --> 02:29:05.92
And then, you know, we'll change strategy. But they are coming along videos YouTube subscribe. If you

1409
02:29:05.92 --> 02:29:11.52
haven't already, if you're in the mood to support, you're under no obligation to subscribe to anything

1410
02:29:11.52 --> 02:29:18.000
by the way. Of course. But if you're free. I'm sure. Totally totally. Also,

1411
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.68
Joc was a store called Joc was store. URL Joc was store. We have shirts. If you like T-shirts,

1412
02:29:25.68 --> 02:29:34.64
cool. Multidimensional, multi-layered, philosophically layered T-shirts. Some travel mugs on there.

1413
02:29:34.64 --> 02:29:38.64
The travel mugs. We're still working on it. I was telling you about the other day.

1414
02:29:38.64 --> 02:29:41.76
Which one? I don't know. I was talking about a layer. There's layers and things.

1415
02:29:42.88 --> 02:29:50.24
Oh, this is what it was. The book, way the warrior kid. There's a layer here. Because the illustrator

1416
02:29:50.24 --> 02:29:58.48
for the book, a warrior kid is a guy by the name of John Bozac. John Bozac was my brother growing up.

1417
02:29:58.48 --> 02:30:04.80
My friend growing up. Good friend. One of my best friends growing up. And when we were kids,

1418
02:30:04.80 --> 02:30:10.000
we were in the hardcore bands and we were playing rock and roll music and stuff. And one of the bands

1419
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.60
that we were in was a little band called Bronson's Children. So the layer here is a one day I posted

1420
02:30:16.48 --> 02:30:23.28
a picture of an old silk screen T-shirt for Bronson's Children. Yes. Which I think we should personally

1421
02:30:23.28 --> 02:30:31.12
reproduce. We're going to get after it. Because Charles Bronson was awesome. He was a legit guy.

1422
02:30:31.12 --> 02:30:38.88
He was an actor. We have nowadays that were you. I'm an actor. He was like, oh, I was a

1423
02:30:38.88 --> 02:30:44.08
tailgunner in World War II, barely survived. They came back and got a job making movies about bad

1424
02:30:44.08 --> 02:30:50.56
asses. That's Charles Bronson. By the way, grew up in a coal miner. He was in the mines

1425
02:30:51.12 --> 02:30:55.52
in some steel town in Pennsylvania, barely spoken. Because he was a Polish immigrant. Anyways,

1426
02:30:56.24 --> 02:31:00.000
with an attitude. That's why that book band was named Bronson's Children.

1427
02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:05.52
So the layer here is, interestingly enough, because I don't have a lot of friends, right?

1428
02:31:06.16 --> 02:31:11.12
Never have. But the layer here is the couple for the few friends that I have.

1429
02:31:11.12 --> 02:31:19.44
I'm good friends with. Yeah. And yeah. And so that old Bronson's Children T-shirt silk screen

1430
02:31:19.44 --> 02:31:26.16
was designed by my guy that was in the band with me, whose name is John Bosac, who now has illustrated

1431
02:31:26.16 --> 02:31:34.96
way of the warrior kid. That's some layers. Yeah. Yeah. That's layers. So, cool. Just a good job.

1432
02:31:34.96 --> 02:31:40.08
They're just good. Yeah. It's awesome. But yeah. Layers. Sorry. Layers. Yeah. I hate

1433
02:31:40.08 --> 02:31:45.28
this go back to the store. Real quick. Uh, the, yeah, I'm sure it's whatever they have layers.

1434
02:31:45.28 --> 02:31:49.76
Cool. If you listen, you know these layers. Or you'll pick up on them, which is, you know,

1435
02:31:49.76 --> 02:31:54.80
I guess kind of makes it one. By the way, I have never thought these layers were super deep, right?

1436
02:31:54.80 --> 02:31:59.84
You, you, I think you think the layers are deeper than I think they are. Yeah. I do. The one that I,

1437
02:32:00.64 --> 02:32:07.44
I kind of was a little bit. I liked was the layers on the equal sign on discipline equals freedom.

1438
02:32:07.44 --> 02:32:14.80
And you made it like a barcode, which matches the layers of the font, which is OCR standard,

1439
02:32:14.80 --> 02:32:18.96
which can be read by a computer just like the equal sign. Apparently by the barcode. So I like

1440
02:32:18.96 --> 02:32:23.68
where you're coming from. Yeah. Layers there. Yeah. The, like, which is the standard, the original.

1441
02:32:23.68 --> 02:32:28.32
Well, fun. The first font. You know what we should do is next t-shirt.

1442
02:32:29.36 --> 02:32:34.96
Let me help you put layers in it. Yeah. And then we can not say what the layers are.

1443
02:32:34.96 --> 02:32:42.80
That people report the layers. Yeah. Actually, the good shirt layers apparently are kind of deep,

1444
02:32:42.80 --> 02:32:46.96
because I've got more than one inquiry about this. They're like, hey, did you realize that the word

1445
02:32:46.96 --> 02:32:52.32
good is spelled backwards? It's like, I don't know if that's a mistake. I don't care. It's a cool shirt,

1446
02:32:52.32 --> 02:32:59.04
but spelled backwards. And I was like, yeah, no, man. It's, it's for you. That message is for you telling

1447
02:32:59.04 --> 02:33:03.20
yourself that, but it's kind of joccal saying it. That's what you look at it in the mirror. It's not for

1448
02:33:03.20 --> 02:33:09.76
other people. It's show your cool shirt. Sorry, it is, but that message. Anyway. So you layers. Yeah. I didn't

1449
02:33:09.76 --> 02:33:14.80
think that was too subtle. Oh, man. You don't teach their own certain people seeing, you know,

1450
02:33:14.80 --> 02:33:19.12
for a different, their mind's some were creative. I'm going to come up with a shirt that's got layers.

1451
02:33:19.12 --> 02:33:26.72
It's layers for days. People are going to have to do analytics analysis on the layers on the shirt.

1452
02:33:26.72 --> 02:33:32.48
Yeah, man. Good. Good idea. You have a shirt that's so layered that no one understands what it is.

1453
02:33:32.48 --> 02:33:35.52
Yeah. Something that happens in literature. It's just when I was going to college.

1454
02:33:35.52 --> 02:33:38.96
You've got something that's so many layers. I'd say, you know what? This has so many layers. It's

1455
02:33:38.96 --> 02:33:44.96
not worth it. If you have to break out a microscope to see the layers, why put them in there?

1456
02:33:44.96 --> 02:33:49.84
I know. Four people on plan earth are going to understand the layers you put in this crazy

1457
02:33:49.84 --> 02:33:55.44
poem that you wrote. Why did you do that? Was that good? If only four people can get it? No, it's bad.

1458
02:33:56.64 --> 02:34:01.84
What's bad for our thing? I want the people to blend them getting. I want some people to be

1459
02:34:01.84 --> 02:34:07.36
able to get them. Yeah. I think layers should be a little bit harder to see. Yeah. That's a nice

1460
02:34:07.36 --> 02:34:11.84
thing. Yeah. Yeah, man. Yeah. You don't need to, I guess, you don't need to. For a while, you

1461
02:34:11.84 --> 02:34:15.92
weren't talking about the layers. You thought that was too much. You weren't back. You know,

1462
02:34:15.92 --> 02:34:19.76
I didn't want anyone to go into a layer fatigue or nothing like this. But yeah, they're back.

1463
02:34:19.76 --> 02:34:24.56
Anyway, layers to on the t-shirt. They're good. Well, you know, they're quality shirts. They're not like the

1464
02:34:24.56 --> 02:34:30.88
cheap, you know, I didn't go to Target and buy a bunch of undershirts. And then that, hey, let's

1465
02:34:30.88 --> 02:34:37.68
spray paint them in the garage. No. They're good. They're good. Anyway, chocolate store.com. Some

1466
02:34:37.68 --> 02:34:42.88
hoodies on there. Some patches. Some cool patches. And rash guards. Just take a browse. Don't

1467
02:34:42.88 --> 02:34:46.88
buy anything. I'm not saying go buy something. I'm saying look at it. You like something. You're in the

1468
02:34:46.88 --> 02:34:53.76
mood to support get something. Get something in return. There you go. Also psychological warfare

1469
02:34:55.20 --> 02:35:01.04
is doing well. And when I say doing well, I mean, it's out there like making a difference. That's true.

1470
02:35:01.04 --> 02:35:06.000
And I remember there is actually a half, you know, whatever few weeks ago I said, oh, yeah, I don't

1471
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.84
need any more. Like I got my boost and then, but yeah, I needed it. I went right back to it and boom.

1472
02:35:11.84 --> 02:35:15.68
It's where easy money. Yeah, that's that's the genius. What did you lead for? What's the

1473
02:35:15.68 --> 02:35:20.72
scenario? The work out? The same as always. Like that. I could easily get some projects to finish

1474
02:35:20.72 --> 02:35:26.96
up right now. And so I loved to wake up early in the morning, work out, but I got to prioritize

1475
02:35:26.96 --> 02:35:33.84
next year right now to finish some projects. And so they today, I didn't. I woke up and wrote

1476
02:35:33.84 --> 02:35:40.96
it because I got projects. And it's it's so easy. If you don't work out in the morning,

1477
02:35:40.96 --> 02:35:45.60
it's so easy to not work out. And because by the time I had this, I didn't get where I wanted

1478
02:35:45.60 --> 02:35:48.72
and had something else and then I'm trying to work on this and then the email. So now,

1479
02:35:48.72 --> 02:35:53.20
because I want to do this, I am just going to get a pre-lunch work out 11 o'clock in the morning,

1480
02:35:53.20 --> 02:36:00.08
get in there and get it done. And the fall of the sun, it was 11, 30, all of a sudden, it was 12.

1481
02:36:00.08 --> 02:36:07.36
Also, it was like 12, 10. Get the work out started. And now I'm a little bit hungry. And you know,

1482
02:36:07.36 --> 02:36:12.40
you, you have your little thought of, you know what, maybe I shouldn't work out. But I actually didn't have

1483
02:36:12.40 --> 02:36:19.68
that thought. You know what I said? Cool. I'm tired. I'm fasted. And I don't feel like working out

1484
02:36:19.68 --> 02:36:23.04
so I'm definitely going to work out right now. And we're making a good one. So that's what I did.

1485
02:36:23.04 --> 02:36:27.44
Well, yeah, but not everybody's like that. Well, no, and like the voice that's in psychological

1486
02:36:27.44 --> 02:36:32.72
warfare, I actually have to live with that. Yeah. Exactly. You know what? Yeah. There's no like,

1487
02:36:32.72 --> 02:36:37.36
it doesn't, I never, it never presses pause. It never stops. It's always in there telling me,

1488
02:36:37.36 --> 02:36:43.52
get to the gym. You don't want to work out good, get in there and crush yourself. I have to live with

1489
02:36:43.52 --> 02:36:49.60
that guy. So yeah, that's good. Which really is the originating story of psychological warfare.

1490
02:36:49.60 --> 02:36:55.68
So if you don't know, psychological warfare is a album with tracks that you can purchase from one

1491
02:36:55.68 --> 02:36:59.84
of the music. There's no music. Correct. Do you think it should I had music?

1492
02:36:59.84 --> 02:37:06.80
Yeah. Well, okay. Maybe. But the problem is there's too many different types of music. Yeah.

1493
02:37:06.80 --> 02:37:11.36
And it wouldn't have the same effect. I don't think. That's true. So I agree with you. Yeah.

1494
02:37:11.36 --> 02:37:16.08
So because otherwise, I would have said, he put some little instrumental, whatever. Well,

1495
02:37:16.08 --> 02:37:21.28
here's something like if there's music on certain things, like you like to listen to certain,

1496
02:37:21.28 --> 02:37:25.20
like, you know, you hear a speech. I don't know. Martin Luther King or somebody saying like a

1497
02:37:25.20 --> 02:37:29.92
speech and one, they want to get inspired. Yeah. It'll work for sure. But that's not really what

1498
02:37:29.92 --> 02:37:36.32
this is in that specific way. It's more like you actually talking. You know, it's good point. It's like

1499
02:37:36.32 --> 02:37:41.84
you're part of like, you know, when you see a like the movie, no country for old men. Yeah. I don't know

1500
02:37:41.84 --> 02:37:47.36
if you see that movie. There's just that there's no soundtrack. Yeah. It's just the actual sounds of earth

1501
02:37:47.36 --> 02:37:52.40
and people and walking. And that is such a cool effect. So I think you're right in this case.

1502
02:37:52.40 --> 02:37:58.72
Yeah. No country for old men. By the way, written by Kornback McCarthy, who also wrote

1503
02:37:58.72 --> 02:38:08.24
Blood Meridian. Yeah. Layers by the way. Layers all over. Yeah. All right. Yeah. That's it. That's

1504
02:38:08.24 --> 02:38:12.40
it's like a lot of work. Oh, I didn't finish it clean what it is. So it's an album you can get iTunes,

1505
02:38:12.40 --> 02:38:18.88
Amazon Music, whichever. And they're basically you listen to it. If you're ever feeling a moment of

1506
02:38:18.88 --> 02:38:23.92
weakness before you want to go, you know, work out before you want to do something or not do something.

1507
02:38:23.92 --> 02:38:27.92
Or yes, yeah, if you're making a decision and you're choosing the short term payoff over the long term

1508
02:38:27.92 --> 02:38:34.08
payoff essentially. No not eating doughnuts or just messing up your diet with doughnuts or sugar stuff or

1509
02:38:34.08 --> 02:38:41.12
doughnuts. Skinny. What was going to airborne school? There was a sergeant major and he was some

1510
02:38:41.12 --> 02:38:48.24
black guy from Georgia. Yeah. And for some reason there's the chatoo, you rivered down there. Yeah. And he says,

1511
02:38:49.04 --> 02:38:54.40
me tell you what, you go down in the chatoo, you river. So he's talking about if you're parachuting and you

1512
02:38:54.40 --> 02:39:01.60
end up in the chatoo, you better watch out the snakes in the chatoo, and his alagators in the chatoo,

1513
02:39:01.60 --> 02:39:09.60
which he and snakes and vines and a wrap you up and snakes snakes in the chatoo. I was thought,

1514
02:39:09.60 --> 02:39:14.88
you know what? It's keep clear of the chatoo, because there's snakes in there. Right. You know,

1515
02:39:14.88 --> 02:39:18.96
so is that kind of what you're trying to replicate there with this psychological warfare? No,

1516
02:39:19.84 --> 02:39:24.000
I forget what I just did, but it led me into that story. Yeah, that was a good story.

1517
02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.40
So the chatoo, who do you river? You know, you gotta beware for sure. Beware the sugar coated

1518
02:39:28.40 --> 02:39:33.36
ice. I don't know. By the way, you're impression of what was his name? I have no idea. He was

1519
02:39:33.36 --> 02:39:39.28
it was so he was what's called a back hat at Army Airborne School back in the early, the

1520
02:39:39.28 --> 02:39:45.52
Navy used to only go to the Army Airborne School. So you get done with seal training and you're on

1521
02:39:45.52 --> 02:39:50.88
good shape and feeling and then you show up at Airborne School, which is a much, it's a less

1522
02:39:50.88 --> 02:39:56.24
strenuous school, the seal training. I mean, you're not special operation if you go there. I mean,

1523
02:39:56.24 --> 02:40:01.36
any pretty much anyone in the Army or many, very many people in the Army. So it's a three week

1524
02:40:01.36 --> 02:40:04.80
school to good school. I mean, obviously the biggest thing you gotta overcome there is not

1525
02:40:04.80 --> 02:40:08.64
physical. It's the fear of heights or whatever fear of jumping. But yeah, so you go down there

1526
02:40:08.64 --> 02:40:11.84
in the black hats or the guys that run Airborne School. It's a totally professional thing. There's

1527
02:40:11.84 --> 02:40:16.56
a lot of fun and that that sergeant major though. He was awesome. He was here at the crazy eyes.

1528
02:40:16.56 --> 02:40:20.72
You know what I mean? Sure. That's what crazy ass is. We had the one other thing he said to me one

1529
02:40:20.72 --> 02:40:25.12
day because he liked me. You know why he liked me? Because I was getting after him. Yeah. And he said to me,

1530
02:40:25.12 --> 02:40:29.76
he goes, hey, and I don't think he, I think he'd call me like Navy. Yeah, it's really

1531
02:40:29.76 --> 02:40:33.68
common. He just called me Navy, right? Because they don't know what our ranks are. So he's

1532
02:40:33.68 --> 02:40:39.84
called me Navy. He's like, hey, Navy. I said, I was like, I think he said clear. For some reason he's

1533
02:40:39.84 --> 02:40:44.56
a clear sergeant major or something. And I'll clear sergeant major. And he goes, maybe day or

1534
02:40:44.56 --> 02:40:51.20
some. When you get back to your CEO team one day, I want you to come over to J. Sock.

1535
02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:59.76
And we'll have fun killing motherfuckers. Now, what do you think? I was I was like 19 years old.

1536
02:40:59.76 --> 02:41:07.04
I am so. Wherever you go, the sergeant major, I'm with you. I'm in the game.

1537
02:41:07.92 --> 02:41:13.84
So yeah, that was a sergeant major black hat down at Airborne School. You kind of sound like a

1538
02:41:13.84 --> 02:41:19.20
Taj Mahal, the singer. That's who he is. That is. He's a blue singer of a hand. Actually,

1539
02:41:19.20 --> 02:41:24.80
we're with his family. I'm cool. He's a traveling guy. But yeah, he's a blue singer. He's a blue singer.

1540
02:41:24.80 --> 02:41:29.04
Okay, but he's from Hawaii. He's going to be out from Hawaii. But he doesn't really get a lot of

1541
02:41:29.04 --> 02:41:34.56
blues when you live in Hawaii. I think you'd be surprised. He saw my camera little imitation there.

1542
02:41:34.56 --> 02:41:42.72
It's good. We're going to kill him motherfuckers. He cares the dust. Anyway, there it is.

1543
02:41:42.72 --> 02:41:49.68
Psychological warfare sounds more like Jocca, not the Taj Mahal. And he tells you, he

1544
02:41:51.44 --> 02:41:57.12
convinces you that making the long-term decision to stick with the discipline path. He gives you

1545
02:41:57.12 --> 02:42:02.80
that boost in your head. So it's like, yeah, that's good. Anyway, check that one out. You want to get one of

1546
02:42:02.80 --> 02:42:07.44
those or all of the just album's goods. Bind number one. Straight up number one. Straight up number one.

1547
02:42:07.44 --> 02:42:12.72
Day one. Day one. So everyone that's going to be the first to get up. Thank you for that's a good way to

1548
02:42:12.72 --> 02:42:18.72
support podcast. So yeah, because it costs 99 to buy the album. Yeah, the whole thing. Just like for

1549
02:42:18.72 --> 02:42:26.80
any, you know what? We were like, oh, so how do we do this? Hey, it's 99. Boom. Done. Yeah.

1550
02:42:26.80 --> 02:42:31.28
You can get it and you're supporting the podcast. So that's cool. Also, you know, nothing you can

1551
02:42:31.28 --> 02:42:36.40
get in this Jocca, like, tea. You can get it. It's in stock, by the way. And it's going to stay in stock.

1552
02:42:36.40 --> 02:42:40.80
I'm a little nervous about saying that, but it's going to stay in stock because you know what? I'm

1553
02:42:40.80 --> 02:42:45.12
confident saying that because I bought a lot of it. Because I don't play around when I make a

1554
02:42:45.12 --> 02:42:51.44
logistical error and we end up with no Jocca, like, tea and everyone's angry about that myself included.

1555
02:42:51.44 --> 02:42:57.60
Guess what? We're going to do something about it. So we have stock. We got a lot of stock and you

1556
02:42:57.60 --> 02:43:07.44
would actually know that you need it because deadlifting, you know you need that 8,000 pound increase,

1557
02:43:07.44 --> 02:43:14.16
which by the way is guaranteed. It's guaranteed to happen. We're hearing about pull ups now, too.

1558
02:43:14.16 --> 02:43:18.000
People that are trying to get better at pull ups are going from 10 to 12 pull ups. Now we're getting

1559
02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:25.20
numbers up around 147, made a moment. And the other thing is the Jiu-Jitsu, if you're training the

1560
02:43:25.20 --> 02:43:32.08
Jiu-Jitsu, and we're probably going to have to add a warning to the label of Jocca, white tea,

1561
02:43:32.08 --> 02:43:35.92
because we got people out there that are just randomly throwing commeros. They can't stop it.

1562
02:43:35.92 --> 02:43:39.52
They're meeting somebody boom, they're throwing a commero on them. Just on the regular,

1563
02:43:39.52 --> 02:43:43.04
just landing commeros all over the place. So you got to watch out for that little warning.

1564
02:43:43.04 --> 02:43:49.68
It's on Amazon. That's if you're here in America, if you're on international orders, go to eBay

1565
02:43:49.68 --> 02:43:56.16
and get it from the official listing of the Jockel podcast. It's sold by pro-resourcing,

1566
02:43:56.16 --> 02:44:01.68
which is actually going to change in the near future because we're getting more involved in the actual

1567
02:44:02.88 --> 02:44:08.08
what's that called fulfillment of the tea. We're joining some for a streamlining. Yes. Yes.

1568
02:44:08.08 --> 02:44:15.52
While your on Amazon also, there's a book called Extreme Ownership, referred to it a

1569
02:44:15.52 --> 02:44:22.88
couple of times tonight, possibly by me and my brother, Lave Babin. And let me tell you what you do

1570
02:44:22.88 --> 02:44:32.72
is you lead within your company or within your team. You infiltrate with extreme ownership.

1571
02:44:32.72 --> 02:44:38.56
Get a copy for your subordinates. Get one for your bosses. Spread the word because it will,

1572
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.000
it will actually improve your alignment and your effectiveness as a team. It will.

1573
02:44:44.80 --> 02:44:49.68
And one thing I noticed, I was at a company that we were working with. And it's very impactful.

1574
02:44:49.68 --> 02:44:53.36
Just when people read the book, all of a sudden, they have a common language. They're referring to

1575
02:44:53.36 --> 02:44:58.08
the problems in the same way. They recognize the problems clearly because they've seen it and they all

1576
02:44:58.08 --> 02:45:04.08
understand it and it improves the communication and the understanding between the groups because they

1577
02:45:04.08 --> 02:45:09.36
know what the problems are because they've been identified in the book. So make that happen.

1578
02:45:09.36 --> 02:45:17.52
And also, you can get a little copy of a book pre-order. It's called Way of the Warrior Kid.

1579
02:45:18.24 --> 02:45:22.48
And you might be thinking, oh, I'm not a kid. I'm going to don't.

1580
02:45:22.48 --> 02:45:30.32
Doesn't matter. You actually need this book too. So there's a part in the book.

1581
02:45:30.96 --> 02:45:37.76
When Uncle Jake is trying to explain to his young nephew Mark what discipline is and why it is

1582
02:45:37.76 --> 02:45:45.84
important and that it starts. Discipline starts by getting up early in the morning. And of course,

1583
02:45:45.84 --> 02:45:49.92
Mark, he just thinks discipline is sort of like following the rules. So Uncle Jake has to do a

1584
02:45:49.92 --> 02:45:54.80
little explain into him and this is what Uncle Jake says. That's one kind of discipline.

1585
02:45:55.76 --> 02:46:01.28
But it isn't as simple as just following the rules. People give you the most important part of

1586
02:46:01.28 --> 02:46:08.64
discipline is following rules. You set for yourself. It is doing things. You might not always feel like

1587
02:46:08.64 --> 02:46:15.60
doing things that make you better. Then Uncle Jake started getting really intense.

1588
02:46:15.60 --> 02:46:21.84
Listen, if you want freedom from being bullied at school by Kenny, you have to have the

1589
02:46:21.84 --> 02:46:26.72
discipline to go to justice to class and learn the skills to defeat him. If you want freedom from

1590
02:46:26.72 --> 02:46:31.84
ridicule when you do pull-ups at school, you have to have the discipline to train so that you can

1591
02:46:31.84 --> 02:46:38.08
do pull-ups. If you want freedom to swim in the water and enjoy your school field trip,

1592
02:46:38.08 --> 02:46:42.64
you need the discipline to overcome your fear of the water and learn how to swim.

1593
02:46:42.64 --> 02:46:49.84
What about school? Do you want to be free of being stumped on tests and not knowing the answers

1594
02:46:49.84 --> 02:46:56.72
to the questions they ask you? Then you need the discipline to study and learn the material they teach you.

1595
02:46:57.52 --> 02:47:04.88
When you get older, you're going to want financial freedom. That means having enough money to

1596
02:47:04.88 --> 02:47:10.16
do what you want without worrying about it and the only way you're going to get financial freedom

1597
02:47:10.16 --> 02:47:16.24
is by having financial discipline, by saving money and not wasting it on things you don't need.

1598
02:47:16.24 --> 02:47:21.20
That discipline starts with getting up early in the morning.

1599
02:47:23.60 --> 02:47:26.08
That's a little hit from my Uncle Jake right there.

1600
02:47:26.88 --> 02:47:34.000
So Uncle Jake is, he's clearly mentoring and helping his young nephew Mark, who's got some

1601
02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:41.28
shortfalls that he needs to correct and Uncle Jake helps and do that. So all kinds of lessons

1602
02:47:41.28 --> 02:47:49.20
to be learned in there for all of us and you know lessons about how to study, how to overcome fear,

1603
02:47:49.20 --> 02:47:55.28
how to get stronger. So order yourself a copy and do it now. This is the thing. We want to do it

1604
02:47:55.28 --> 02:47:59.92
now again, I pointed this out before. We want the publisher to print enough so that there's not a shortage.

1605
02:47:59.92 --> 02:48:03.44
Right. If everybody waits, then the printer goes, oh, Greg, you need to know. That's when he

1606
02:48:03.44 --> 02:48:09.12
copies. And then everyone orders it when it comes out and now we have a backup and everyone's angry.

1607
02:48:09.12 --> 02:48:15.84
So order it now that way we have enough when it rolls out and get one, you know, get one

1608
02:48:15.84 --> 02:48:21.44
free the kids at school with classroom, library down the street, get the word out there. I wish

1609
02:48:21.44 --> 02:48:31.52
I wish I had this book when I was a kid. I wish I had this book when I was a kid. So it actually

1610
02:48:31.52 --> 02:48:36.72
comes out May 2nd and then by the way two days later after May 2nd after this book comes out,

1611
02:48:36.72 --> 02:48:42.16
it's going to be time for the extreme ownership. Master number 002 in New York City,

1612
02:48:42.16 --> 02:48:48.72
May 4th and 5th, Maria Markey in New York City, we're finalizing all the details right now and

1613
02:48:48.72 --> 02:48:53.76
I'm telling you what, it's going to be awesome. We're going to get after it and it's going to leave a mark.

1614
02:48:55.28 --> 02:49:01.12
It will have an impact on you. It's intense. It's going to be powerful. And the other cool things

1615
02:49:01.12 --> 02:49:07.60
you're surrounded by all these other people that are all in the game out there crushing it.

1616
02:49:07.60 --> 02:49:16.08
Every imaginable industry, every level of leadership, just getting after it. So sign up, book your

1617
02:49:16.08 --> 02:49:22.48
ticket, get your hotel room. And by the way, I mean, obviously, Wave is going to be there. I will be there.

1618
02:49:22.48 --> 02:49:31.44
So will JP to now. Of course, Echo Charles is going to be rolling around cruising as he likes to say.

1619
02:49:32.08 --> 02:49:39.20
Dave Burke, who's now new to Ashland Front team. JP has been on Ashland Front team for a little bit.

1620
02:49:39.20 --> 02:49:42.72
You know, basically came on the podcast and we said, you know what, we got to get you in the game.

1621
02:49:42.72 --> 02:49:51.60
So JP is in the game, obviously. And Dave Burke, just coming on right now, done a couple of

1622
02:49:51.60 --> 02:49:56.80
work with a couple of companies so far. Wasn't a Marine Corps fighter pilot, top gun,

1623
02:49:57.92 --> 02:50:04.64
top gun instructor, by the way. And also was with us with Task Interpruser as the angle

1624
02:50:04.64 --> 02:50:09.60
co-team leader in the Battle of Ramani. So awesome guy. He's going to be coming on the podcast.

1625
02:50:09.60 --> 02:50:17.52
You're sure soon. I'm so so can't wait for that. And I'll also tell you, we will be hanging out with you

1626
02:50:19.20 --> 02:50:24.64
talking, discussing things overcoming problems. There's no backstage, no green room.

1627
02:50:26.32 --> 02:50:34.64
I'm not that guy. No, none of that. No curtain behind, tied behind just us, all of us. All these

1628
02:50:34.64 --> 02:50:39.44
guys I'm talking about, including echo Charles. We brought echo Charles up on stage last time.

1629
02:50:40.16 --> 02:50:44.96
Do you even like that? No. He doesn't like public speaking. I think you need to give a speech,

1630
02:50:44.96 --> 02:50:52.48
like a five minute speech about something. No, okay. So come on out, do that. And until the

1631
02:50:52.48 --> 02:50:59.12
mustard until we do get there in the meantime, you know that you can find us on the interwebs.

1632
02:50:59.12 --> 02:51:09.68
On Twitter, on Instagram. And even you want to find us right there on that face of

1633
02:51:09.68 --> 02:51:18.48
bulky boha. We are there. And we are interacting on the interwebs. Echo is at echo Charles.

1634
02:51:19.20 --> 02:51:25.12
And I am at Jocka Willink and to close this out to the warriors out there in the world,

1635
02:51:25.12 --> 02:51:32.000
giving us freedom and protecting this country. A country by the way where we can say whatever we

1636
02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:40.64
want, where we are blessed with unprecedented freedoms in thought and speech.

1637
02:51:42.64 --> 02:51:49.44
Thanks to all you servicemen and service women out there in the world, holding the line right now,

1638
02:51:49.44 --> 02:51:56.24
protecting those freedoms and keeping evil at bay. And the police and law enforcement that do the

1639
02:51:56.24 --> 02:52:05.76
same for us here at home. Keep us safe from evil. Thank you for putting on your vest every day

1640
02:52:07.20 --> 02:52:15.12
into the firefighters and the EMTs that are standing by 24 hours a day. Think about that 24 hours

1641
02:52:15.12 --> 02:52:25.68
a day to come and help us. And of course, we never say thank you or we never even see them until

1642
02:52:25.68 --> 02:52:33.52
some unforeseen horror comes and that's when you're there for us. So thank you for your vigilance

1643
02:52:33.52 --> 02:52:43.20
and to everyone else listening to this podcast. Thanks for going down this path with us, this path

1644
02:52:43.20 --> 02:52:51.44
of learning and gaining knowledge and trying to get a better understanding of the world and trying

1645
02:52:51.44 --> 02:53:03.36
to get a better understanding of ourselves. So we can all recognize and overcome our weaknesses and

1646
02:53:03.36 --> 02:53:18.72
our faults and we can all get out there and get after it. So until next time this is echo

1647
02:53:18.72 --> 02:53:35.84
and jacco out.
