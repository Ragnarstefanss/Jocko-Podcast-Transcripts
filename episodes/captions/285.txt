[00:00:00] This is Jockel fondcast number 285 with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jockel willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening. And also joining us tonight.
[00:00:07] Dave Burke, good evening, Dave. Good evening. All right. So we are going to dive into some work that I have been
[00:00:16] waiting to dive into it. I waited because I wanted to do it justice. I waited because I wanted to
[00:00:25] be thorough in covering it. I waited because there's a lot of work to cover. And going
[00:00:35] going into this, this particular book, books, series of books, articles, individual,
[00:00:42] the more I read over the years, it got better and better and kept getting better and kept making
[00:00:48] more sense to me from a tactical battle war perspective, from a leadership perspective,
[00:00:58] from a how-to lead perspective and also, contraryly like a red cell type, how not to lead,
[00:01:10] from a relationship leadership, capital perspective and a Jockel perspective. So basically,
[00:01:17] I was just seeing everything in my life wrapped up in this particular, this particular individual
[00:01:25] and his work. And on top of that, so that there's another podcast that I've got waiting in the
[00:01:31] wings or it's going to take a series of podcasts, but it's waiting in the wings. I'm super excited
[00:01:35] to do it, but I can't do that podcast until I do this podcast or at least this podcast or at least
[00:01:40] a couple of podcasts. On this individual, this one man, highly influential man, a guy named
[00:01:46] BH, Lidel, Hart, Basel, Henry, Lidel, Hart. You can probably guess if you don't know who he is.
[00:01:53] If you know military history and military strategy and military theory at all, you know who he is.
[00:02:00] If you don't know who he is, you can probably guess that he's British because he has the first name,
[00:02:04] Basel, right? Sure. I mean, that's a pretty British name. You didn't go to buy Basel. I guess he went
[00:02:10] by BH, I guess. I'm guessing that's how he writes his books. Mother's maiden name was Lidel.
[00:02:19] She was Scottish. You know, right, born and raised, I guess on the border of England.
[00:02:24] The heart side, the Lidel, the heart side was farmers. He was, he was, went to some really nice
[00:02:33] private schools, anything. So he grew up in England, born in France, but grew up in England.
[00:02:37] He went to some really nice private schools. The first one of the private schools that he went through
[00:02:41] is called St. Paul's, which is in London. And it was founded in 1509.
[00:02:49] High school, founded in 1509. Okay, so that's just kind of crazy when we think about England.
[00:02:56] Then he ended up at Cambridge University, which, by the way, was founded 300 years prior to that
[00:03:01] in 1209, 1209, 1209. Well, he left Cambridge University, one World War I broke out,
[00:03:14] volunteered for the British Army. He was in the King's own Yorkshire Light Infantry.
[00:03:18] Glad we did that light infantry podcast recently. Dave, you've timed it all. You like that one,
[00:03:24] didn't you? I did. Made you start thinking about some light infantry because it's a mindset.
[00:03:28] Yeah. It's not just a way that people are trained. It's a way of thinking.
[00:03:33] Yeah. And I got to pull that real time at Master. I listened to it all the way to Master and put it into
[00:03:37] my brief. What was that point that you made? Well, the whole point behind that, like the largest theory
[00:03:43] when you went into it was the size of the force is not the deciding factor. There's a lot of this,
[00:03:48] if you have a smaller force, doesn't guarantee your defeat. And the whole point of this was like,
[00:03:53] how are we going to move think maneuver in a way that a smaller force that looks weak on paper
[00:03:58] and just outmaneuver these big giant forces because they're inflexible, immobile, they're dug in.
[00:04:03] So that theoretically in my mind resonated with all sorts of stuff. Can you imagine as I was
[00:04:08] learning due to and thinking about that actual thing? How many how many how many elements
[00:04:15] started to just come into view? Like come out of the fog as I'm thinking through that very thing.
[00:04:21] I'm learning due to it's I'm like, oh, if I can maneuver myself over here and put all my force
[00:04:27] against a smaller portion of their strength, I can win.
[00:04:33] All right. So he goes into the British Army. He is part of the King's own Yorkshire light
[00:04:42] infantry shout out to Yorkshire. He spent time on the Western Front World War I.
[00:04:48] And got sent back from the front two times because he was blown up and had conclusive injuries.
[00:04:58] Cool. Hey, listen, you went to the front. You got blown up so bad that you got sent back,
[00:05:03] because you had conclusive injuries. Cool. You good. Okay. Go back. All right. You get blown up again.
[00:05:09] Boom. You know what? You're good. Okay. Go back again. Third time he goes back. Cool.
[00:05:14] Um, gets back just in time for the battle of the song. And during the battle of the song,
[00:05:21] wounded three times. Continue to fight. Finally, he gets gasped. Badly enough that he can't continue
[00:05:28] fighting. His battalion was just about wiped out on the first day of the offensive.
[00:05:35] Battle of the song. This is so his battalion was some of the 60,000 casualties on day one.
[00:05:41] And that event and those events clearly left a mark on his mentality. Because you've heard
[00:05:51] me go off and talk about the, I don't know if I've used the word stupidity before,
[00:06:03] because it's not the right word, but the, the, the problem with World War I of
[00:06:09] hey, okay. We just lost a battalion at 0,600. Cool. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5. Dave. Your battalion's going.
[00:06:16] Okay. Dave's battalion just got wiped out. Okay. Echo at 6, 10. Your battalion. Go.
[00:06:21] And that's what we're doing. That left a mark on him. Eventually, after he's wounded,
[00:06:27] started to heal up, went back, trained new recruits, wrote the infantry training manual.
[00:06:33] After the war. After the war. After the war, hands up right in the infantry training manual.
[00:06:37] He got married. Got married to a woman named Jesse Stone. We're wondering what layers are there.
[00:06:45] Had a son, he retired in 1927. Came a journalist. Military historian, military theorist.
[00:06:53] wrote the most wrote so much. It's ridiculous. It's just writing all the time. Deep historical
[00:07:07] writing analysis, worked for Prime Minister Chamberlain. And he was kind of maneuvering and
[00:07:15] getting people to think in a different way of different way of using air power or different way of
[00:07:19] using tank power or different way of using maneuver warfare. And of course, we all know what happened
[00:07:23] with Prime Minister Chamberlain. He was weak and Churchill took over. And when Churchill took over,
[00:07:31] they kind of used the more traditional war strategy in the beginning. Guess who didn't do that.
[00:07:38] You know, who didn't do that Hitler, the Nazis, who were actually paying attention.
[00:07:42] Now, there's some question around how much influence heart, Le Del Hart had over the Nazis.
[00:07:52] There's definitely some meaning. They were reading the line in Patton. I read your book.
[00:07:58] Right. So Patton saying he read Rommel's book. Well, there's there are actual connections
[00:08:04] between Rommel and some of the other more known, more well known and some of the lesser well-known
[00:08:11] Nazi leaders that were reading his stuff. I'm being like, I know this makes this makes sense.
[00:08:16] There's also a lot of people that will say that that be a child. Kind of inflated that a little bit.
[00:08:23] But there was some influence. And also regardless of how much of a connection there was,
[00:08:30] even if there wasn't a connection, they were both thinking the same things. Right. They were both
[00:08:34] taking and learning the same lessons, which that's what that happened sometimes. You know, you put
[00:08:39] somebody in one situation, they're in a vacuum from someone else. If you put them in a similar
[00:08:43] situation like World War I, there's a pretty good chance that they could come to similar conclusions.
[00:08:48] Like maybe it's not smart just to line up and start attacking all at once. Maybe we should use
[00:08:53] some decentralized command. Maybe we should use maneuver warfare. So they all kind of came to the same
[00:08:57] conclusions, meaning BHLadel Hart, meaning some of the German and Nazi leadership.
[00:09:05] And so that stuff kind of came into play. So he wrote a bunch of this stuff down.
[00:09:13] He wrote a book called The Strategy of the Indirect Approach, which was also printed
[00:09:20] as the way to win wars, which is pretty cool. And what this is kind of what kicked me into
[00:09:25] hyperdrive of doing this, and we talked about this on the underground. So I did a post about
[00:09:32] about the Civil War. I did a post a social media post about the Civil War, about the Battle
[00:09:37] of Chancellorville, about Jackson taking the indirect path going 14 miles around to the flank of the
[00:09:42] Union troops and winning the battle in an hour as opposed to just taking the direct assault towards
[00:09:47] the Union troops, which is a half a mile. And some of the comments in there, you know,
[00:09:52] I'll, of course, what do I focus on? But most of the comments were like, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:09:56] Use the indirect approach. And I talked about using it towards people, and in a leadership position,
[00:10:01] how the indirect approach is normally the best way to go. And people were like, you know,
[00:10:07] you should just tell the truth. Like, are you saying you should lie to people? So it was that whole
[00:10:10] thing. And so I look, I know where I got these ideas from. It's no mystery to me. And part of it is the
[00:10:18] fact that you put me in and you put someone in an environment and you make them figure something out.
[00:10:25] They're going to come to the same conclusions. Right. So some of this stuff I was thinking,
[00:10:30] man, going to the flank makes a lot of sense. And it makes a lot of sense from leadership.
[00:10:33] But, but I also know that these ideas were dripped into my head over the years. I mean, when you do
[00:10:38] a basic seal assault on a target, guess what? You set up a base element that puts down covering fire
[00:10:46] and then a flanking element goes around, that's what you do. This is not rocket science. So I know
[00:10:51] that some of my indirect, my theory, my thoughts around the indirect strategy, the indirect approach.
[00:10:57] I know some of those were just from being in the military. But I also know that some of it came
[00:11:02] from reading heart. And so it made me crack open some of these books again and made me kind of fast
[00:11:09] forward in my mind to getting to these sooner in this podcast. Because let's face it. When
[00:11:25] well, the theories based in reality. Right. And that's what that's what's interesting about this.
[00:11:29] When you have someone that's spent time in the military, because the the the name of this book
[00:11:35] that one of the books we're going to look at today is the strategy of indirect approach. And it's
[00:11:39] about the theory, right? But if you have someone when you have someone that's been in war and spent
[00:11:47] time as a military leader and spent time in combat, and spent time in the worst kind of combat,
[00:11:53] like the actual worst combat. The actual worst combat, battle of salt, like the worst combat,
[00:12:00] actual worst combat, it doesn't, it's not theory anymore. Right. That theory becomes based deeply
[00:12:07] in reality. And that's what we have with with this book. And we're becoming covering two of his
[00:12:14] books today. Or at least trying to cover two of them. We might make it through, I don't even know
[00:12:19] how much because there's a lot to talk about. One is called the strategy of the indirect approach,
[00:12:24] which which I guess said was also reprinted as the way to win wars. And the other one is just
[00:12:28] called strategy straight up. So I guess we're going to get to it. Anything, Dave?
[00:12:43] I wrote down the word travesty. When you were talking about war one, I just wrote that word
[00:12:48] down just to remind me of the thing that I think about is you, when you talk about losing a battalion,
[00:12:54] it says scale, I think it's actually kind of hard to comprehend when to think of a battalion.
[00:12:58] I mean, I have, we have lost. I've been on patrols where we lost a vehicle. The lost people in
[00:13:03] a whole vehicle. A battalion is on a scale and just sort of the willingness to allow that to happen
[00:13:10] over and over again. And then then in retrospect thinking, and I was thinking of this as you said,
[00:13:14] it was the Germans had to learn that same lesson. They had to have learned the same lesson.
[00:13:19] You know, the Marine Corps takes a little bit of pride in sort of showing up, having the similar
[00:13:23] experience and then saying, we're not doing this anymore. And the Marine Corps really takes pride in
[00:13:27] that and we teach that history. But in actual world war one, yes, where you're talking about. Yes,
[00:13:32] in actual world war one of showing up sort of after the war had been underway for quite some time,
[00:13:38] getting on board with how is how is being done and then suffering massive casualties in
[00:13:43] the very initially engagements and saying, we're done with this direct assault approach.
[00:13:47] And the larger point to that is the idea that not just for him, but for Germany as well,
[00:13:53] the idea that the way we did that was a travesty and that that you would see how those lessons
[00:14:00] apply to well beyond just warfare that that would sink into your psyche and every single
[00:14:05] everything you did in your life would be informed as such a bad way to describe like it's
[00:14:12] influence on a level that you wouldn't just rethink how you did war. You would rethink every
[00:14:17] aspect of your life. If you suffered the casualties to that degree because of the willingness
[00:14:21] for leaders to just say, just like you described, your battalions gone, you're up next.
[00:14:26] And the fact that it influenced every aspect of his life is actually not even remotely surprised
[00:14:30] to me. Yeah, and it boils down to, and I know you like when I say this Dave, it becomes not just a
[00:14:36] theory, not just a strategy, but a way of thinking, a way of thinking. Yes, what it becomes. And what's
[00:14:42] interesting is, we're about to hear exactly how that transpired in his head. And this is something
[00:14:51] we covered this and we could actually covered this on the underground. But I just, I had to touch
[00:14:54] on the underground, but we're going to go deep. So here we go. Here's the preface. My original
[00:15:01] strategy of the strategy of indirect approach was written in 1929, published under the title,
[00:15:07] the decisive wars of history. It has been out of print for some time. So there's another third
[00:15:12] title that this book has been published under. In the following year, in the years following
[00:15:17] its publication, I continued to explore this line of fall. And from the results of such further
[00:15:22] study compiled a number of supplementary notes, which were privately circulated. Since the course
[00:15:29] of the present war has provided further examples of the value of the indirect approach and thereby
[00:15:35] given fresh point to the thesis, the issue of a new edition of the book provides an opportunity
[00:15:42] to include these. So now he's writing this, he's putting this one out in World War II.
[00:15:50] And actually it's towards the end of World War II because well, he's he's
[00:15:54] ends up talking about World War II and what's happening. When in the course of studying a long
[00:16:02] series of military campaigns, I first came to perceive the superiority of the indirect over the
[00:16:09] direct approach. I was looking merely for light upon strategy. So he starts off just looking like,
[00:16:15] okay, how does this work? How can we win? Seems like this indirect thing's pretty cool.
[00:16:20] Seems like a good strategy for the battlefield. With deepening reflection, however,
[00:16:26] I began to realize that the indirect approach had a much wider application that it was a law
[00:16:34] of life in all spheres, a truth of philosophy. Right? A law of life in all spheres.
[00:16:48] So this is where we get crazy because there's so many people. So many people, this is like,
[00:16:55] oh, you got to be direct. That's just such a common theme in the world. You got to be direct.
[00:17:00] You got to be frank. You got to tell. So I get it. I get it. I get it. He found that this has a
[00:17:08] much wider application. And it's a law of all, all of life in all spheres, a truth of philosophy.
[00:17:16] It's fulfillment was seen to be the key practical achievement in dealing with any problem
[00:17:22] where the human factor predominates and a conflict of wheels tends to spring from an
[00:17:29] underlying concern for interests. Okay. So here's where this gets awesome. So he's talking about
[00:17:37] conflict, right? A conflict of wheels. And what we might fail to realize is that if I'm on the
[00:17:43] same team as Dave, we can also still have a conflict of wheels because Dave wants to A and I want to
[00:17:52] do be. So even though we're on the same team, that's like one of the other perspectives that I think
[00:17:58] about this. You know what I said about leadership capital and relationships? That's this applies
[00:18:02] 100% there, too. In all such cases, in all such cases. So this is cases where you have
[00:18:13] the human factor. Anytime you got the human factor, in all such cases, the direct assault of new
[00:18:19] ideas, provokes a stubborn resistance, thus intensifying the difficulty of producing a change of
[00:18:26] outlook. Dave, how long have you heard how many times have you heard me tell this to clients,
[00:18:32] to people? This is it. It's I don't have the vocabulary to explain how often we say that in
[00:18:41] some version of that sentence in everything. But I got to be careful because I could probably just
[00:18:46] just hearing it and invoke so many things that think about. But he's almost articulating it like
[00:18:54] when there's a human component to this and I'm thinking of myself. So when is that not, when in my
[00:19:00] life am I not interacting with another human being? If we're if we're doing a computer software
[00:19:05] design, right, we don't need to worry about this. Right. If we're actually programming a machine of
[00:19:10] some kind, we don't need to worry about it. Yeah. Other than that, other than that, if you directly
[00:19:16] assault an idea, it's going to provoke stubborn resistance. So if I impose my plan on Dave,
[00:19:21] it's going to get resistance. Even though Dave's on my team, I impose a plan on it's going to be
[00:19:25] resistant. And it's going to make the change of outlook harder. It's going to make the change of
[00:19:34] outlook harder. So if my wife wants something and I attack it, it's going to be harder for her to
[00:19:41] change her mind. There's going to be more resistance for her change, you can remind on where we're
[00:19:45] going out for dinner. That's what's going to happen. Back to the book, conversion is achieved
[00:19:54] more easily and rapidly by unsuspected infiltration of a different idea or by an argument that
[00:20:04] turns the flank of instinctive opposition. So you're going to get more easy, more easily and more
[00:20:13] rapidly conversion of their brain will come when you flank them. Check and faster and faster rapidly
[00:20:24] and more easily by an unsuspected infiltration of a different idea and by the way, don't let
[00:20:31] well we'll get to it. So there's some people that are thinking right now, oh, so what you're going to
[00:20:34] use going to lie to Dave? No, I'm not going to lie to Dave. Doesn't mean I didn't mean I say,
[00:20:40] well, actually, Dave, we should use my plan because Adam and I'm going to make up some intel that
[00:20:43] sports my plan. I'm going to make up a timeline that sports my plan. No, that's not what I'm talking
[00:20:47] about at all. Back to the book, in commerce, the suggestion that there is a bargain to be secured as far
[00:20:56] more potent than any direct appeal to buy. And in any sphere, it is a proverbial
[00:21:02] that the surest way of gaining a superior acceptance of a new idea is to persuade them that it is
[00:21:10] his idea. Hello, this is something again. Maybe I should just start paying what is it? Paying
[00:21:21] royalties. I just own royalties to be it because leadership strategy and tackle, oh, that's just
[00:21:25] all in there. Let us make it their idea. As in war, the aim is to weaken resistance,
[00:21:32] before attempting to overcome it. And the effect is best attained by drawing the other party
[00:21:38] out of his defenses. Great. We're not attacking hardened positions. This idea of the indirect
[00:21:45] approaches closely related to all problems of the influence of mind upon mind. All problems of
[00:21:56] the influence of mind upon mind. All problems. Any time it's my mind against someone else's mind,
[00:22:02] this is where we need to go and direct. The most influential factor in human history.
[00:22:10] Yet it is harder reconcile with another lesson that true conclusions can only be reached or
[00:22:17] approached by pursuing the truth without regard to where it may lead or what its effect may be
[00:22:22] on different interests. So what do we say in there? And how are we saying? Wait a second. Wait a second.
[00:22:27] What shouldn't we be going after the truth? Like, isn't it the, look, if I'm working with Dave
[00:22:33] and I think my plan is better, well then I need to tell him that. That's the truth. The truth is my
[00:22:39] plan is better. And what's so hard about this is one of those universal things that pisses me off.
[00:22:44] I got you. There's no one that it's against all moly high ground to lie. Right? So the opposite
[00:23:01] of lying is what? Truth. Telling the truth. So if we're certain to think that this is not telling
[00:23:08] the truth and what do we do it? We must be lying. So how do we reconcile? That's what we say.
[00:23:14] How do we reconcile this? Wait, I have a different plan than Dave. I think my plan is better.
[00:23:19] I should tell him the truth. That's what I should do. I shouldn't lie to him. We're not talking
[00:23:25] all lying to him. Back to the book. History bears witness to the vital part
[00:23:31] that the prophets have played in human progress, which is evidence of the ultimate practical
[00:23:38] value of expressing unreservedly the truth is one sees it. Okay. So now we're going to get
[00:23:44] he's going to use the example, historical examples and there's countless of
[00:23:50] prophets. Someone that is a prophet that stands up and says this is the truth as I see it.
[00:23:57] And tells the truth. Yet it also becomes clear that the acceptance and spreading of their
[00:24:05] vision has always depended on another class of men. What's the other class of men? Leaders.
[00:24:13] Leaders who had to be philosophical strategists striking a compromise between truth and men's
[00:24:22] receptivity to it. So lately I've been saying a lot of what good is telling the truth if no one
[00:24:29] hears it or no one listens to you. If you stab somebody in the eye with the dagger of truth,
[00:24:35] what are they going to do? They're going to be pissed. They're going to lash out at you. They might
[00:24:39] even pull out a side arm and shoot you in the gut. But they definitely don't want to hear anything from
[00:24:44] it. And they'll do their best to pull that thing back out and stab you with it. So even made any progress
[00:24:50] at all. So that's what a prophet does. A prophet says this is the truth and they stab you in the eye with it.
[00:24:56] A leader has to find that compromise between telling the truth and getting people to actually listen to it.
[00:25:07] Their effect has often depended as much on their own limitations in perceiving the truth as on their
[00:25:12] practical wisdom in proclaiming it. So how are you going to tell the truth? Practical wisdom. How are
[00:25:17] you going to say? How are you going to say it? Where it'll actually be listened to?
[00:25:22] And then he goes on to say this, the prophets must be stoned. That is their lot. That is their
[00:25:32] test of their self fulfillment. What happens to the prophet? The prophet gets stoned. The prophet gets
[00:25:36] crucified. That's what happens. But a leader who is stoned may merely prove that he has failed in
[00:25:47] his function through a deficiency of wisdom or through confusing his function with that of a prophet.
[00:25:54] This is pure brilliance, by the way. This is absolute pure brilliance. So if you're that, if you're
[00:26:00] an leadership position and what you do is you start stabbing people with the dagger of truth in the neck
[00:26:07] and you think you're doing a good thing. Guess what? They're going to tackle you and they're
[00:26:11] going to stone you to death. They're going to execute you because you were stabbing people and
[00:26:14] it offended them and it hurt them and that you didn't convince anybody of anything. So sometimes
[00:26:20] you get a leader that's like, look, the truth is, listen, they're going to tell you the truth here.
[00:26:24] That's not good. It's not going to help you. It's crazy. You're like on page one. I know.
[00:26:34] I'll page one half. Yeah. I think the phrase that's been coming to mind a lot lately when you
[00:26:44] talk about this is a truth that it's imposed upon somebody compared to the truth that they
[00:26:51] discovered for themselves, the difference between those two. And I'm thinking of all the phrases
[00:26:57] that people use when they're going to reveal the truth. Let me stop you right there. Actually,
[00:27:03] like when you hear people prepping for the the direct assault, which is, I'm now going to let you know
[00:27:10] and even the preparation for that, just that phrase alone puts the other person in a position where
[00:27:15] all they want to do is defend themselves. And the words that come next, almost don't even matter because
[00:27:20] if I say, actually, Jaco, the reality is. The reality is. The first thing you do is is you mentally
[00:27:28] you are dug in. No matter how truthful I'm going to be after that, it's just the connection that
[00:27:34] he's making though, like the how universal that is to all interactions is just it's it's
[00:27:41] crazy listening to this and then the the application to every interaction you have. With every
[00:27:47] with if any human being and how instinctive it is to, I guess, tell the truth and how ineffective
[00:27:55] that way of thinking is if there's an outcome that you're trying to shape.
[00:28:01] Eko Charles, every ever seen the movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yes, sir. Okay. So there's
[00:28:07] an arc, right? Our feet arc of the covenant. And I think the truth is kind of like that.
[00:28:15] If you reveal that truth in an improper way, people's faces are not enough. That's what happens.
[00:28:22] Yeah. So people treat the truth as if it's only benevolent as if it can only do good.
[00:28:31] But you gotta remember there's collateral that truth causes collateral damage and people don't
[00:28:35] pay attention to that. So when you start pulling off the lid, maybe you got to like,
[00:28:40] you got to prep people for it. You got to say, turn your eyes for a second here. There's going to be
[00:28:44] some bright lights. If you don't prep them for it and what what we want to do,
[00:28:49] what we want to do is we want them to reveal the truth themselves. That's what we really want.
[00:28:57] A really good leader. Look, a profit will show you the truth. Maybe you're getting melted.
[00:29:01] A really good leader. You somehow discover the truth. That means they showed it to you. But you're
[00:29:07] even out. So the whole expression, the truth hurts. You know that, that's because that's kind of
[00:29:13] common right? Truth. So would that be an indicator of maybe a profit or not the correct rate?
[00:29:20] That's profit all day long. Profit is like, look, look, I go, true, third, but I'm going to tell you
[00:29:24] something. You know what I mean? How how how how how open-minded are you when I get done with that statement?
[00:29:30] I would meet it with stubborn resistance check. And you know, we like to think that, you know,
[00:29:36] I really have a good relationship with someone. You know, great. There might be one person in your
[00:29:40] entire life that you can be like, hey, dude, that was jacked up and you're like, cool, got it.
[00:29:45] What adjustments to write it? There's one person in your life you can do that with.
[00:29:48] Yeah, it is maybe. Isn't that at the end of the day in a way the indirect approach anyway?
[00:29:53] Because you know, you say, okay, that one person. Yeah, but you know, why is that one person? Because you
[00:29:56] have this years and years and years and years and years of this indirect, you know, kind of approach or
[00:30:01] whatever end of the year. So you open up that little hole that, yeah, you have that direct line all day.
[00:30:05] Now, yeah, now he's at, yes, you are correct, even that approach. Because if you were to met that
[00:30:10] person day one three years ago and said, you know, I was looking at the video you made,
[00:30:15] I'm not feeling it. Actually, you know, the camera angles that you use kind of marginal, right?
[00:30:21] So these are five years of work in with you before I could be like, bra.
[00:30:25] The soundtrack. No, actually. You put a Christmas song in there. It was actually right away.
[00:30:29] Yeah. You're right. Back to the book. Time alone can tell whether the effect of such a
[00:30:38] sacrifice redeems the apparent failure as a leader that does honor to him as a man. So there's a
[00:30:43] chance that you could, you could present something in over time. People go, yeah, he was right.
[00:30:49] At the least, he avoids the more common fault of leader of leaders. That of sacrificing the truth
[00:30:56] to expediency without ultimate advantage to the cause. So occasionally a leader is like, you know what,
[00:31:04] we just need to tell the truth and you sacrifice it. It gets killed. It gets thrown away. And
[00:31:08] one of the books that I'm, or the podcast that I want to move to from this one, which I will get
[00:31:13] to and I'm not 100% sure when, but they got all these examples of problems in the military and
[00:31:18] military thinking. And one of the problems, and I forget the exact number, but there has been like
[00:31:24] 20 major advancements in naval warfare in the last 500 years. And every one of them was met with
[00:31:33] absolutely stiff resistance. No, not everyone in 17 of them were met with stiff resistance by all
[00:31:39] senior naval leaders in the world. You know, they started making ships from steel instead of
[00:31:48] what? And watch what like this is, Rio, you can't repair steel. We can need a well-drawn
[00:31:51] topic. They resisted, switching to the steam engine, switching to gas, which I reduce all, switching to
[00:31:58] like all the, every people resisted every one of these things, every one of them. Well, sorry,
[00:32:03] 17 out of 20 of great advancements. It happens all the time. Because somebody goes hard with the truth
[00:32:12] and people defend. They go in instant defense mode. So like, remember the movie are independent.
[00:32:19] No, no, Army getting. I don't think I ever actually saw it, but. It's too bad. It's good flick.
[00:32:24] Oh sure. I wasn't that up for several Oscars. Anyway, Armageddon, Bruce Willis.
[00:32:31] Oh, yeah. Asteroid coming in, right? What was the plan that won? Do you want to
[00:32:36] arm again? I did. Sorry, dude. Yeah. In dependency, I was, I was down in the middle of
[00:32:42] that. We're just culturally lost. It's okay. I'll explain to you. Asteroid coming in,
[00:32:47] right? World world ending asteroid global killer. So they're like, hey, let's just throw a blast it with
[00:32:55] nukes and blow it right out of the sky. Then the smart scientists is like, that's a bad idea.
[00:33:00] Everyone gets all mad, right? No, actually, we're going to you know, direct approach.
[00:33:04] Lunch nukes, right? Can't get anymore directed that. But the smart scientists said, nope,
[00:33:09] this is what you're going to do. You're going to go in there. You're going to drill a little hole.
[00:33:12] You're going to put a nuk in that hole. You're going to just nudge it just a little bit on the side.
[00:33:17] It's now that trajectory gets changed. Do you see what I'm saying? That was the smarter approach.
[00:33:23] Same thing, exactly right. Here I am going through historical books trying to figure this stuff out.
[00:33:28] I could figure it out with Armageddon. I get it on the Bruce Willis. Yeah, you don't go to
[00:33:32] bother with all this. Check. Back to the book. We good. Yes, Armageddon. Yeah. I'm just saying these
[00:33:40] ideas everywhere. You see them say we go bad. No. For whoever, habitually suppresses the truth.
[00:33:47] So this is where this is where you have to pay attention. Because again, it's not me lying to
[00:33:52] Dave and saying, well, actually, Dave, the timeline that's required for the plan, you, but we better use
[00:33:57] my plan. Whoever, habitually suppresses the truth in the interest of tact will produce a deformity
[00:34:05] from the womb of his thought. So you can't, you can't lie about what you're saying. You have to
[00:34:13] maintain, you have to maintain the truth, but you have to take an indirect approach. That's it.
[00:34:20] It's not a lie. It's an indirect approach bound to the truth. He explains it a little bit more.
[00:34:28] Is there a practical way of combining progress towards the attainment of truth with progress
[00:34:36] towards its acceptance? Is there a way to get Dave to think about my plan and utilize my plan
[00:34:45] with also doing it in a way that he is open to accept this idea? Is there a combination of those two
[00:34:52] things of telling Dave the truth about what I think of his plan? And at the same time, getting him to
[00:34:57] accept my opinion, that's what we want, right? A possible solution of the problem is suggested by
[00:35:05] reflection on strategic principles, which point to the importance of maintaining an object
[00:35:11] consistently and also of pursuing it in a way adapted to the circumstances. This seems so obvious
[00:35:22] is that we continue to focus on the right thing, but then we continue to move towards this objective
[00:35:27] but as circumstances change, we adjust, we maneuver. We say, oh yeah, there's a massive enemy
[00:35:33] location right here. Let's not continue in that direction. Let's go around it.
[00:35:38] Isn't it smart to do that with our ideas as well? It doesn't mean we abandon the objective.
[00:35:42] It doesn't mean we say, oh, we're going to change this objective or we're not going to continue
[00:35:47] to, it means we adjust our approach and maybe instead of going direct, we go indirect.
[00:35:54] Opposition to the truth is inevitable. That's a good thing to remember.
[00:36:04] Opposition to the truth is inevitable, especially if it takes the form of a new idea,
[00:36:09] but the degree of resistance can be diminished by giving thought not only to the aim but to the
[00:36:15] method of approach. Avoid a frontal attack in a long established position. Instead, seek to turn it
[00:36:23] by a flank movement so that the more penetrable side is exposed to the thrust of the truth.
[00:36:33] But in any such indirect approach, take care not to diverge from the truth. For nothing is more
[00:36:40] fatal to its real advancement than to lapse into the untruth.
[00:36:47] So for the people that commented when I talked about the indirect approach and we're like, oh,
[00:36:52] you're just going to lie to your people. No, no, we're not going to lie to our people.
[00:36:56] The truth is the objective, but we are going to adjust our approach so that we're not offensive
[00:37:02] to the individuals or the groups that we're talking to so that we don't cause them to put up a
[00:37:08] more stiff resistance to fight against our idea, to, to, for them to look at it as if it's not the truth.
[00:37:15] We're going to get a flank. That's what we're going to do. And then he goes on here and he says
[00:37:25] the meaning of these reflections may be made clearer by illustration from one's own experience.
[00:37:32] Looking back on the stages by which various fresh ideas gained acceptance, it can be seen
[00:37:40] that the process was eased when they could be presented, not as something radically new, but as
[00:37:45] the revival in modern terms of a time-honored principle or practice that had been forgotten. So here's
[00:37:50] is one of his little indirect approaches is to take a new idea and and camouflage it with an old idea.
[00:38:00] It's kind of like what the, what the Christians did with the Vikings. Right, Easter, you know,
[00:38:05] the term Easter and yes, it's a pagan thing, but we call it this a pagan word and it's a pagan ceremony.
[00:38:16] But the Christians were like, oh yeah, you can call the thing in the spring. We call that Easter. It's cool.
[00:38:21] It's about Christ rising, but we call it Easter. It's sort of a thing that you guys already do.
[00:38:27] They just kind of taken all the idea and rebrand it. That's actually what they did.
[00:38:31] Yeah, I think they did that with Christmas too. That was Christmas too. So that's what we're doing.
[00:38:37] We're kind of camouflaging this idea. So it's a little more open to it. Yeah, you know how you guys do the spring time thing
[00:38:42] and you guys celebrate birth, right? We had, you know, like a rebirth kind of co-brand that thing. We're good.
[00:38:50] It's kind of like your dog. Great. We can feed them the heart pills.
[00:38:53] Right, heart worm pills. Okay. You put it in a little, put a little piece of steak around that.
[00:38:58] Yeah, you know, like you've been eating this food this whole time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just put the, put the heart worm pills in there.
[00:39:07] He goes, he goes on to say, here, this required not deception, but care to trace the connection. Since there is nothing new in this one.
[00:39:13] Right, you can always figure out something that ties into what you're doing.
[00:39:18] A notable example was the way that the opposition to mechanized mechanization was diminished by showing that the mobile
[00:39:24] armored vehicle, the fast moving tank was fundamentally the air of the armored horsemen and thus the natural means of
[00:39:31] reviving the decisive role, which cavalry
[00:39:34] played in past ages, which is what we call what do we call armored cavalry now? Why is that because people
[00:39:41] resist this tank? It's going to get stuck. It takes gas. I mean, the horse can go forever. You can eat off the land.
[00:39:46] How are you going to refuel these tanks? People just resisted that idea. Is this? And then it's like, oh no, no, this is the new
[00:39:50] cavalry. Okay, kind of cool. Then we're down. So what can you do is you try and convince people of ideas
[00:39:58] taking all my idea, repackage it. And it's true because there's no idea new ideas under the sun. It's not like you're lying to them.
[00:40:10] I don't know. Obviously, what's coming in terms of, you know, that how much detail is in and
[00:40:16] warling discuss, but even just even just the word the truth, how that's the, it's the topic that you're
[00:40:24] trying to get across. Yes. And even what that means, like, if I have an idea, that's different than
[00:40:34] me like trying to get you to understand some sort of like, hey, two plus two is four. And you're going to say no.
[00:40:39] Okay, as opposed to I think we should do this and the abandonment of that truth versus, all right, listen, I can't
[00:40:47] just walk up to Jack and go, hey, this is the new way we're going to do, it's all this problem.
[00:40:53] And even just the word truth has a connotation like I'm right in your wrong, as opposed to,
[00:40:58] hey, I'm trying to get you to see this a different way. And it might not end up exactly how I've
[00:41:03] drawn it out. Maybe my drawing is like ends up in 80% or whatever, but I could see people getting
[00:41:09] hung up the idea that I have to convince Jack of the truth, meaning I know the answer.
[00:41:14] He doesn't. And if he doesn't, then I've got to figure out how to, and maybe the fast way
[00:41:18] to just shove it in his face to go dude, this is what we're doing. As opposed to getting him to
[00:41:22] see that there might be another way of doing it, which is actually the truth, as opposed to,
[00:41:27] it has to be exactly my way. And if there's a mind field between you and me,
[00:41:31] I guess I could go into that mind field, but it's not going to help me get you to see something
[00:41:38] different. And he, I think, said the quote is, resistance to the truth is inevitable.
[00:41:42] Yeah, resistance to your ideas are inevitable. Yeah. So let's not, let's not pretend like you
[00:41:48] might be able to avoid that resistance, that mind field, that barrier, that wall, it is there.
[00:41:56] I just think the idea of the truth of us committing to, it is this way as opposed to, I want to
[00:42:01] think of something a different way. Yeah. No, that's a great point because what we're really,
[00:42:06] well, when we start talking about an in a leadership capacity, it becomes, hey, it's my idea.
[00:42:14] And as we were talking on EF online today, it's like, my assumption is that my idea is flawed.
[00:42:21] And I can present my idea to you, but I still presented as if not it's the truth, but it's an
[00:42:28] idea of a possibility. Now, what's interesting is what does that do to my idea? It makes it
[00:42:34] indirect totally. It makes it indirect. Me packaging the idea that I have as a possibility or as
[00:42:41] a thought or an idea for me, as opposed to this is the way we should do it. It makes it in
[00:42:47] indirect approach. And what we talked about today on EF online, I actually believe that. So I don't
[00:42:56] have to act. I don't have to pretend like, hey, I'm going to pretend like this isn't the best
[00:43:00] idea ever. And like Dave should just shut up and do it my way. I'm going to pretend that. So that
[00:43:05] way, it's a little more indirect. No, I actually think, this is my idea seems like a good idea, but
[00:43:09] there could be some holes punten to which is fine. I'm okay with that. So yeah, when we start
[00:43:14] talking about getting people's ideas and any time you, I mean, there's very few things that I
[00:43:21] actually hear something I've said early podcast is the amount of times that I say, Dave
[00:43:29] brought, listen, this is what we should do. The only reason I'm going to say that is if I am a 100%
[00:43:41] 100% convicted that I, and it, it, you probably have never even heard me say that
[00:43:47] because it's so rare. Now, look, there was times where in this EF team somebody wanted to do something
[00:43:53] that was bad. Oh, you want to, you want to set up on two sides of a road and ambush someone in the
[00:44:00] middle. Okay, so that means we're going to be shooting at each other. Like, this is bad. We do not want
[00:44:04] to do that. Of course, how often did guys present to plans to me like that? Almost never. So most
[00:44:10] of the time it was, you know, hey, think through that, but very rarely, very rarely do I have the
[00:44:17] approach that I actually know the capital T true. Right. So this is a very good point to make.
[00:44:25] You, you, whoever you aren't, you don't know the truth. Very seldom are you 100% convinced.
[00:44:31] Hey, my idea is the truth. Don't walk around with that attitude. It's not good.
[00:44:40] All right, we're getting into this next section here, which is called history as practical
[00:44:46] experience starts off by saying, fool, say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by
[00:44:53] others experience this famous saying quoted by Bismarck, but by no means original to him has
[00:44:58] peculiar bearing on military questions for this often been remarked that the soldier, unlike
[00:45:03] followers of other person professions, has but rare opportunities to practice his profession.
[00:45:09] Isn't that interesting? Look, you're in the military cool. You're a professional soldier.
[00:45:13] Awesome. How often do you actually get to do that job? The answer is not as often as a normal,
[00:45:20] not as often as a carpenter, not as often as a plumber, not as often as a software engineer.
[00:45:26] You might get to train for it. You might, but how often are you locked and loaded and
[00:45:31] in combat with someone else in the military? Back to the book. Indeed, it might even be argued that
[00:45:38] in a literal sense, the profession of arms is not a profession at all, but merely he casual
[00:45:42] employment. And paradoxically, that it's cease to be a profession when the soldier of fortune
[00:45:48] gave way to the professional soldier. When mercenary troops were employed and paid for the purpose of
[00:45:52] war, were replaced by standing armies which continued to be paid when there was no war.
[00:45:56] So if you're a mercenary, you'd be like, oh, there's a war over there, cool. I'm going to go do
[00:45:59] that. That's kind of like a plumber. Oh, there's a different war over here, cool. I'm going to go to that one.
[00:46:02] Oh, there's a different war over here, cool. That's a little bit more of an actual profession.
[00:46:06] You might end up in more combat in your life than if you're in a standing army. That's doing
[00:46:10] that job even when there's no war going on. This logical if somewhat extreme argument recalls
[00:46:16] the excuse often made in the past for paying officers a rate inadequate to live on and by some of
[00:46:21] those officers for doing an inadequate today's work, the contention being that the officers pay
[00:46:27] was not a working salary but a retainer paid to him for the benefit of having his services available
[00:46:33] in case of war. This reminds me of some of the information about the British army and how just
[00:46:41] the officers during certain phases were just actual aristocrats that had almost no interest in fighting
[00:46:51] wars and almost complete interest in going to the country club. Some of the, some of the
[00:47:02] biographies of some of the guys that led the Boor war were pretty embarrassing and then they showed
[00:47:11] up for the Boor war with pianos and just I think it's not crazy. If the argument that strictly
[00:47:20] there is no professional arms will not hold good in most armies today on the score of work,
[00:47:26] it is inevitably strengthened on a score of practice by the increasing for infrequency of wars.
[00:47:32] So there's less and less wars now. Are we then left with the conclusion that armies are doomed
[00:47:36] to become more and more amateurish in the popular bad sense of that much abused and misused word?
[00:47:43] So hey look, if you're in the military, you're not getting to fight all the time. Does that mean you
[00:47:46] become an amateur over time? For obviously even the best of peace training is more theoretical than
[00:47:52] practical and experience and you know what I like? Well the reason I wasn't going to do this section
[00:47:55] but guess what? It's the same thing with leadership. It's the same thing with leadership. You're
[00:48:01] in a leadership position. How often are you actually in a challenging situation? In leadership?
[00:48:06] How often do someone say hey boss, I'm not doing this. How often do someone say that I'm not
[00:48:11] working with that person like you you end up with combative situations but how often is that?
[00:48:17] Because normally people are hey yeah, yeah, God boss that sounds like a good plan. Like that's
[00:48:21] what you're normally getting. You're not normally as a leader. Hopefully you're not normally being
[00:48:27] combative. So it's the same thing. How do we train for that?
[00:48:35] Bismarck throws a different and more encouraging lead on the problem. It helps us to realize that there are
[00:48:40] two forms of practical experience, direct and indirect and that of the two indirect practical
[00:48:45] experience may be more valuable because it's infinitely wider. So look you can get that experience
[00:48:50] of dealing with a bad employee but how often do you actually deal with? How many Marines did you
[00:48:55] have to write up? Hardly any. Yeah, ever. I mean like how many seals that I have to write up?
[00:49:04] How many seals that I have to fire? When we're working with companies we work with companies
[00:49:08] with thousands of employees. The combative situations are much more rare than the day to day.
[00:49:16] Hey, this is what we're doing normal leadership. Yeah, and how often is the problem even as bad
[00:49:21] as you think it is? You know, when we'll get questions about how do I deal with the boss who
[00:49:27] wants my team to fail? When I say hey, if you really think about the problem, they're not,
[00:49:31] they're often not as bad or as significant and not of the magnitude that we even make it out to be.
[00:49:40] Even in the most active career, especially as soldiers career, the scope and possibilities of
[00:49:43] direct experience are extremely limited in contrast to the military. The medical profession
[00:49:48] has an assistant practice, right? They're doing a surgery a day, two surgeries a three surgeries a
[00:49:53] yet the greatest achievements in medicine and surgery have usually been due to the research worker
[00:49:58] and not to the general practitioner. Direct experience is inherently too limited a form
[00:50:04] to form a secure foundation for either theory or application. So if the only combat experience
[00:50:09] you're going to get is combat experience. You're going to be screwed. At the best, it produces an
[00:50:16] atmosphere which is value in drying and hardening the structure of our thought. If you only have a
[00:50:24] little bit of combat experience, that's what you become. If you don't open your mind up.
[00:50:29] If you only have a little bit of leadership experience, that's what happens when you get
[00:50:32] in the sealed teams. You know, we'd have on the job training leadership. That's how guys would
[00:50:36] become that's how they'd get their leadership training. Just by watching their platoon chief or
[00:50:40] their platoon commander. So if they weren't good, that bad example would dry and harden in their
[00:50:47] mind and become they way they would be too because they didn't open their mind up to different
[00:50:52] indirect experience. The greater value of indirect experience lies and it's greater variety and
[00:50:58] extent, right? History is universal, experience the experience, not of another, but of many others
[00:51:05] under manifold conditions. Boom. So we can learn about leadership from everywhere.
[00:51:14] Here we have the rational justification for military history. It's preponderant, practical value
[00:51:21] in the training and mental development of a soldier. But the benefit depends as with all experience
[00:51:28] on its breath, on how closely it approaches the definition quoted above and on the method of studying
[00:51:34] it. So we got to study and look the whole premise of this particular podcast is understanding human
[00:51:43] nature, is understanding leadership by understanding how people act in war. Why is that? Why don't
[00:51:48] we study a bunch of business cases? Well, because if you want to see human nature be revealed,
[00:51:56] you've got to put some pressure on it. You've got to put some, there's no better pressure.
[00:52:00] No better pressure than combat. Soldiers universally concede the general truth of Napoleon's
[00:52:07] much quoted dictum that in war, the moral is to the physical as three to one.
[00:52:14] Cool, yeah, we covered that on this podcast and all of Napoleon's maximums. But here we go.
[00:52:19] The actual arithmetic proportion may be worthless from morale as apt to decline if weapons be
[00:52:26] inadequate and the strongest will is a little use inside of a dead body. But although the moral
[00:52:33] and physical factors are inseparable and invisible, the same gains its immortal value because it
[00:52:38] expresses the idea of the predominance, the predominance of moral factors in all military decisions.
[00:52:46] So obviously it's not like, okay, here's the numerical. You have this much, you have this much physical
[00:52:52] situation, open the morale's three to one. That's not what we're talking about, but it's that idea.
[00:52:59] On them, constantly turns the issue of worn battle and in history of war, they form the more constant
[00:53:04] factors changing only in degree, whereas physical factors are fundamentally different in almost
[00:53:09] every war in every military situation. That's the important part of this. That's the important
[00:53:15] part of this. You've got the physical factors, right? The physical, but that changes. But what does
[00:53:24] and change? The history of war, they form more constant factors to green, changing only in degree.
[00:53:31] The physical factors go all over the place because we got machine guns, we got tanks, we got people
[00:53:37] with night vision, like it's, there's different physical things but the, but the human nature doesn't
[00:53:43] change. This realization affects the whole question of the study of military history for practical use.
[00:53:50] The method in the last few generations has been to select one or two campaigns and to study
[00:53:55] them exhaustively as means of developing both our minds and a theory of war. But the continual
[00:54:00] changes in military means from war to war and tail a grave danger, even a certainty that our
[00:54:07] outlook will be narrow and lessens fious. In the physical sphere, the one constant factor is that
[00:54:16] means and condition are invariably inconsistent. So the physical stuff we can study it, like,
[00:54:22] okay, what, how did you maneuver in a situation? How did you, what weapons did you use over here?
[00:54:28] Well, guess what? You fast forward 30 years and we got different weapons. You fast forward six years
[00:54:32] and we go from no night vision to all night vision. So that's what we're studying. What are we looking at?
[00:54:41] In contrast, human nature varies but slightly in its reaction to danger, some men by race,
[00:54:48] by environment or by training may be less sensitive than others but the difference is one of
[00:54:53] degree, not fundamental. So people are people. The more localized the situation and our study,
[00:55:02] the more disconserting and less count-utable is such a difference of degree. It may prevent
[00:55:07] an exact calculation of the resistance which men will offer in any situation but it is not
[00:55:11] impaired. The judgment that they will offer less if taken by surprise than if they are on the
[00:55:17] alert. This is like, so it doesn't matter where you look in history. The person that's surprised
[00:55:21] to person, the person that's on alert, you're going to get the same almost the exact same reaction.
[00:55:26] Less if they are weary and hungry than if they are fresh and well fed. Look, we, then, we go back
[00:55:30] thousand years, two thousand years. Well fed troops that are well rested are ready to rock and roll.
[00:55:37] Weary, hungry, they're not. The broader, the, the broader, the psychological survey, the
[00:55:45] better foundation in a force for deductions. So you have to look throughout history and see
[00:55:50] all these different battles and see what the psychology of the soldiers and leaders was.
[00:55:55] The predominance of the psychological over the physical and its greater consistency
[00:56:01] point to the conclusion that the foundation of any theory of war should be as broad as possible.
[00:56:09] An intensive study of one campaign, a less based upon, a less based on extensive knowledge
[00:56:14] of the whole history of war is as likely to lead us into pitfalls as onto the peaks of military
[00:56:19] achievement. So if you just look at one campaign and that's where you base everything on your wrong.
[00:56:26] But if a certain effect is seen to follow a certain cause and a score or more cases in different
[00:56:33] epochs and diverse conditions, there is ground for regarding this cause as an integral part of
[00:56:39] any theory of war. You see something one time, it doesn't mean jack. If you see something four times
[00:56:45] but it's all in the same campaign and the same local and the same soldiers fighting against the same
[00:56:50] other soldiers, again it's a minimal. But when you take it over centuries or millennia and you see
[00:56:56] the same thing over and over again, maybe you should pay attention to that one. The thesis set
[00:57:04] forced in this book is the product of such an extensive examination. It might indeed be termed
[00:57:09] the compound effect of certain causes these being connected with my task of military editor
[00:57:14] for insecticolopedia or Britannica. For all I previously dealt in a various periods of military
[00:57:20] history according to my inclination, this task compelled a general survey of all often against
[00:57:26] my inclination. So he was the military editor for the insectolopedia or Britannica.
[00:57:31] You know what that is, echoed Charles? Of course, yes. I'm just saying, wait, you're millennial?
[00:57:35] No, I'm not. Jocco. Okay. Some people I bet a kid right now does not know what
[00:57:41] the insectolopedia Britannica was. When we were kids, that was kind of it, right? That was Google.
[00:57:49] That was Google. Yep. That was Google. Gotta go find the letter. Yes. Find. Yeah, I'm
[00:57:53] not spying. Boom. Pull it out. There you go. And there are some letters that were like two
[00:57:58] and one like Q and R. All right. Cool. We're good with that book. With that volume.
[00:58:05] So this guy was the editor and the military editor. And even though previously he would just kind
[00:58:11] of study what he wanted to study, but then all of a sudden he had to go back and study all these
[00:58:13] other things. And he starts seeing all these continual similarities through everything he's
[00:58:20] seeing. And here we go. He says in the survey, or even a tourist, if you will, has at least a wide
[00:58:29] perspective and at least take in the general live land where the minor knows only his scene.
[00:58:36] So if you if you study one war, one battle, and that's what you just go deep in that scene,
[00:58:41] you know a lot about that one scene, but the guy that's up an altitude, surveying all land. He's
[00:58:46] got the whole lay of the land. During this survey, one impression grew ever stronger that throughout
[00:58:54] the age of throughout the ages, decisive results in war have only been reached when the approach has
[00:59:01] been indirect. In strategy, the longest way round is apt to be the shortest way home.
[00:59:16] More and more clearly has the fact emerged that a direct approach to one's mental object,
[00:59:22] or physical objective. And he uses this term a lot as you're going to hear me read. He just
[00:59:28] calls something the object. We always call it the objective and he actually goes into like,
[00:59:33] why that's not a good word. So a lot of times you'll hear him say object.
[00:59:39] More and more clearly has the fact emerged that a direct approach to one's mental object or
[00:59:43] physical objective along the line of natural expectation for the opponent has ever tended to
[00:59:50] and usually produced negative results. So if you take that path, that's kind of expected.
[00:59:55] Chances are we're not going to work out well. The reason has been expressed vividly in
[01:00:00] Napoleon's dictum that the moral is to the physical is three to one. It may be expressed scientifically
[01:00:06] by saying that while the strength of an enemy country lies outwardly in its numbers and resources,
[01:00:12] these are equally dependent upon stability or equilibrium of control, morale, and supply.
[01:00:19] To move along the line of natural expectation consolidates the opponent's equilibrium and by
[01:00:28] stiffening it, augments his resisting power. I think that comment, the one you made just a minute
[01:00:40] to go that quote, the longest way around is the shortest way home. I think that's the piece that
[01:00:45] that for whatever reason I think we see is the most hard to accept that. And I think my point is
[01:00:53] probably better served by saying the opposite is also true. The shortest way around is the longest way
[01:00:58] home. If I just get to the point, I will get to the end faster. And the opposite is true. And
[01:01:04] just the willingness to recognize the more indirect I am. The longer this journey is to get this
[01:01:12] other person to see the truth, the faster this is going to be. And that's such a hard thing. I think
[01:01:17] for people to embrace, for example, you just said is the more you see me taking this direct path
[01:01:25] towards you, the more the more dug in you will become, because you see it coming. And what I'm doing
[01:01:33] is so much less important than how I am doing it that you won't hear anything, as I'm saying,
[01:01:38] any of the ideas that I'm offering or any of the truth that I'm delivering. And
[01:01:42] it will take me longer. And the, I'm a direct person. I have to tell the truth. That's just how I am
[01:01:50] the recognition that that is the longest way. And sometimes you'll never get there.
[01:01:57] Yep. Yeah. The way I often explain this to clients is I usually just preemptively say, I know what you're
[01:02:04] all thinking. You all are thinking, is that doesn't sound very efficient? It'd be much more efficient
[01:02:09] for me just to say, Dave, this is how we're doing it. He way more efficient to do that. And it's just,
[01:02:14] like you said, it's just so hard to realize that that's the longest way home. That's the longest way home.
[01:02:22] The line I just read to move along the line of natural expectation. That's the shortest route.
[01:02:28] Consolidates the opponents equilibrium. So when you, when you are going where they expect you to go,
[01:02:37] that's where they put their defenses. That's what happens. That's why in Fujitsu, you have to mess
[01:02:42] with their balance. You have to come from a different angle. And by stiffening it,
[01:02:50] augment its resisting power, by the way. Because when you know where I'm coming at you from, you are
[01:02:55] ready to fight. And you know what to do to fight. In war, as in wrestling, the attempt to throw the
[01:03:05] opponent without loosening his foothold and balance can only result in self-exhaustion,
[01:03:09] increasing in disproportionate ratio to the effective strain put upon him.
[01:03:15] Victory by such a method can only be possible through an immense margin of superior strength
[01:03:21] in some form and even so tends to lose decisiveness. So if we're wrestling,
[01:03:27] which let's face it, we're wrestling. If what we do is attempt a take down with no setup or attempt
[01:03:34] a submission with no setup, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. Like we're training with Carrie today.
[01:03:41] Carrie's a white belt, right? Guess what? He's a white belt been trained for a year. If you grab
[01:03:47] his arm, you're not going to get it. You're not going to get it. You have to do something else.
[01:03:52] You have to set him up even a white belt in Fujitsu.
[01:03:55] In contrast, an examination of military history, not of one period, but of its whole course,
[01:04:06] brings out the point that in almost all the decisive campaigns, the dislocation of the enemy
[01:04:12] psychological and physical balance has been vital to a successful attempt at his overthrow.
[01:04:19] Dislocation uses that word a lot. Dislocation. Putting people off balance, getting the
[01:04:28] getting in their head. Not letting them, well, I guess it's the true opposite of
[01:04:35] consolidation of equal in real. Like here I am, I'm stable. Oh, dislocated. Now I'm not where
[01:04:40] I want to be. This dislocation has been produced by a strategic and direct approach.
[01:04:45] Intentional or fortuitous. Sometimes people just accidentally end up off balancing somebody cool.
[01:04:52] It may take varied forms as our analysis reveals for the strategy of the indirect approach is
[01:04:57] inclusive of but why and but wider than the maneuver sir, sir, lay, dairy, air.
[01:05:06] Which is French. Don't want to be human to try, but it means maneuver behind someone.
[01:05:11] Which general came in's research is showed as being the constant aim and key method of Napoleon
[01:05:17] in his conduct of operations. While came in was concerned primarily with the logistical moves,
[01:05:22] the factors of time, space and communications. This analysis seeks to probe deeper into psychological
[01:05:29] foundations and in doing so finds an underlying relationship between many strategic
[01:05:33] operations which have no outward resemblance to a maneuver against the enemy's rear yet are.
[01:05:41] Nonetheless, definitely vital examples of the strategy of the indirect approach.
[01:05:46] So sometimes it doesn't look like what you're doing is an indirect maneuver, but it is.
[01:05:54] To trace this relationship and determine the character of operations is not necessary
[01:06:00] and is indeed irrelevant to tabulate the numerical strengths and detail the details of supply and
[01:06:06] transport are concerned as simply with historical effects in a comprehensive series of cases
[01:06:11] and with the logistical or psychological moves which led up to them.
[01:06:17] If similar effects follow fundamentally similar moves in conditions which vary widely in scale,
[01:06:23] nature and date, there's clearly an underlying connection from which we can logically deduce a
[01:06:28] common cause and the more widely the conditions vary the firmer of this conduction, this deduction
[01:06:34] and what he's saying there is look when you take a bunch of examples over time throughout history,
[01:06:41] it becomes really clear that this isn't just a fluke, this is the reality of the situation
[01:06:46] and that's so so here's what we're going to do.
[01:06:49] So this guy is a historian and the next giant chunk of these books is he goes historical.
[01:07:01] What was that book we read in the book where people went statistical?
[01:07:03] Oh yeah, that's right. It was one of those world war II things. Somebody went statistical.
[01:07:08] The officer went statistical law and he started telling me about how long officers were living.
[01:07:13] He said the average officer is living about 5,5 hours up there. Good luck.
[01:07:17] He went statistical law me. What B.A.S. LeDell Hart does he goes historical?
[01:07:23] And he goes from the 5th century to the 20th century. He goes from the Greek wars, the Roman wars,
[01:07:30] the Byzantine wars, the medieval wars, the 17th century, the 18th century, the French Revolution,
[01:07:34] Napoleon, he gets to the first world war, the second world war, and he goes through
[01:07:40] just detailed battles and talks about the indirect approach. And what we're going to do is
[01:07:50] we're actually going to bypass those and there's a couple of reasons why. Number one, get the books.
[01:07:56] Get the books. Number two. This is what we do all the time on this podcast. This is actually
[01:08:00] what we do all the time on this podcast. We talk about Napoleon. We talk about his person Russia.
[01:08:05] We talk about World War I. We talk about World War II. We talk about Vietnam. We talk about
[01:08:09] Korea. And we've seen and pointed out the indirect strategy all the time. All the time. That's what we do.
[01:08:15] We how do I usually talk about it? The flank. This is what we talked about maneuver warfare.
[01:08:21] This is what this is about. This is what this whole podcast is about. It's these historical lessons.
[01:08:25] And B.A. LeDell Hart. He serves them up for us in this book.
[01:08:32] So, so if you want to get those, who knows, maybe one day we'll jump into these.
[01:08:41] But if you want to jump into them, get the book. Get the book strategy by B.A. LeDell Hart. You can get
[01:08:47] in-depth on these things. But what I want to do is I want to kind of jump ahead to his book
[01:08:53] strategy where he goes into the theory of strategy. And he starts off by saying having drawn our
[01:09:03] conclusions from analysis. Oh, by the way, the analysis that he's talking about that he draws
[01:09:06] conclusion from is like 315 pages. So this is no, this is when he's talking about, oh, what?
[01:09:12] You need to study all these different eras. He does it. And points out the indirect
[01:09:16] approach and how it wins every single time. Even if it was by accident, it's what makes us win. He says,
[01:09:24] having drawn our conclusions from analysis of history, it seems advantageous to construct on the
[01:09:30] fresh foundation of a new dwelling house for the strategic thought. So he's looked at all these things
[01:09:36] that have happened. And we got to kind of get, we kind of got to hit the reset button. He says,
[01:09:44] let us first be clear on what is strategy. Clouds fits in his monumental work on war, defined it as
[01:09:53] the art of the employment of battles as a means to gain the object of war. In other words,
[01:10:00] strategy comes strategy forms the plan of war maps out the proposed course of the different campaigns
[01:10:06] which compose the war and regulates the battles to be fought in each. Now, this is probably
[01:10:14] since episode 7 of this podcast, people have been okay, you can do classmates, you can do classmates
[01:10:19] on war, hey, you can do one more. And there's a couple of reasons why I haven't done it yet,
[01:10:24] and I'm sure we will, and I owe it to military history to do it. But there's a couple of reasons.
[01:10:33] One reason it's like kind of, it's such a popular one, that's hey, you know what, that's right out there,
[01:10:38] is it really the first one I want to hit? I'd rather hit some other strategic ideas. I mean,
[01:10:47] I guess I did do Sun Siwon war. So this is one of the excuse, maybe? I've always known
[01:10:55] that classmates, or I always felt that classmates, you know, respect, respect,
[01:11:00] classmates, we're giving him respect. By the way, here's why this,
[01:11:05] classmates is no just hey military theorist, right? This is a guy that sat in a ivory tower and
[01:11:10] fought about war. He entered the military at age 12 as a Lance Corporal. You know what I'm saying?
[01:11:17] Like this is no joke. fought in the Ryan campaigns, fought in the Napoleonic Wars,
[01:11:24] went to the military academy at Berlin, worked for Sean Horses, who I've talked about a bunch
[01:11:31] on this podcast because when it comes to maneuver warfare, he's kind of that guy in the beginning
[01:11:35] that lost with the press normie to Napoleon at the Battle of Jenna. And when he did, he looked
[01:11:41] around and said, what the hell just happened and realized there was some decentralized, some indirect
[01:11:45] warfare going on and started kind of making that. Well, well, CrossFit's kind of was under his wing.
[01:11:51] And then when the Prussians made an alliance with Napoleon, CrossFit's was like no,
[01:12:00] and he joined the Imperial Russian army. And then when they broke up that alliance, he went back
[01:12:04] to the the Prussian army. It was a Chief of Staff of three Corps and just battles,
[01:12:10] Napoleonic battles at the Battle of Waterloo. He was in that campaign. He was preventing
[01:12:18] some of Napoleon's reinforcements and showing up, which obviously caused the problem.
[01:12:25] When back was an instructor at the then the director of the military academy at Berlin,
[01:12:33] and by the way, this whole time he's writing down what his thoughts are.
[01:12:38] And then he ended up dying of color before he had these before he was able to complete his works.
[01:12:44] And really before you might say, and LaDelle Hart kind of makes the assumption that he was kind
[01:12:50] of heading in a different direction. So he's respectful but critical of CrossFit's, that's kind of,
[01:12:58] that's, I don't want to say that's the way I've always felt, but I kind of have always felt that
[01:13:02] way a little bit. I don't know, maybe that's because I'm a little bit of a contrarian,
[01:13:09] but maybe more than that, CrossFit says things that I go, really, really.
[01:13:19] And by the way, the CrossFit's mentality is kind of what brought us to World War I.
[01:13:26] And that mentality of mass, which is what it is, premier, a principles, is like, hey, we're going to get,
[01:13:35] I have more people than you, I'm going to win, which as we know, when we compare that to the,
[01:13:44] principles behind light infantry, it's not what we're looking for.
[01:13:49] There's also a connection in there too, even between what was talking about earlier,
[01:13:54] between the physical and the moral of these physical attributes. And they vary from campaign
[01:14:00] to campaign, which is part of the reason why you don't want to overreact to the less,
[01:14:04] the physical lessons of a particular campaign, because even as simple as like desert warfare versus
[01:14:10] jungle warfare, those lessons, forwarding rivers, those are physical lessons, and then they're
[01:14:14] not that they're invaluable, but the physical principles of mass or those components are less
[01:14:24] important. Now, one of that, the other, you have to have them both, but I was even just sitting
[01:14:29] here thinking of when Tom Fif was here, who's talking about World War II, Korean Vietnam, not from
[01:14:37] historical standpoint, but actually a participant standpoint. But the lessons he was talking about,
[01:14:42] he didn't spend a bunch of time on World War II we were dealing with this physical environment. It was
[01:14:48] the universal, the universal nature of his lessons were take care of your people.
[01:14:53] I'm going to tell you how to look, if I listen to you on this podcast, read, that the fundamental
[01:14:59] principle of leadership in success and battle was taking care of your people. I'm looking at
[01:15:05] about face as I'm looking at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages, and he probably has a
[01:15:09] whole bunch of physical lessons. And it's not to say that those aren't important, but those are
[01:15:15] never the ones that the leaders really, when they're talking about the lessons they learn and that
[01:15:19] moral component, I'm just using moral to use the same language. It's the human nature piece
[01:15:24] like you were talking about, and how much more important that is. And I remember even in getting a
[01:15:29] master's degree was, was cost with sort of central to the strategic studies, and there's a
[01:15:33] physical focus on that. And the principle of his master's a great example. And listen,
[01:15:41] I would love to go to war with an advantage in master every time. That'd be awesome.
[01:15:46] But we know that that's not the deciding factor. We know that.
[01:15:52] Interestingly, as you pointed to about face, there's one book that we haven't covered on this
[01:15:58] podcast by Colonel David Hackworth, which you would think would be just like prime. It's called
[01:16:03] Vietnam, Vietnam primer. And Vietnam primer is a book to get you ready to go to Vietnam. And it literally
[01:16:09] shows like, hey, here's how far out you should put your clay more. It's, it's just, we could
[01:16:14] cover it. I'm sure we could, we could get some lessons from it. But compared to about face, not even close.
[01:16:21] Here's the other thing that's interesting. Is that cover move, right? Cover move
[01:16:27] the first law of combat leadership. If you're in the jungle, you better cover move. If you're in
[01:16:33] the desert, you better cover move. If you're doing a river crossing, you better cover move. If you're
[01:16:38] doing an assault, you better cover move. If you're in an airplane, if you're in an airplane, at 38,000
[01:16:44] feet, AC kicking, you better cover move. So that's, I think what was weird for me was as like
[01:16:53] cover move, and that's another thing. Cover and move. Cover and move. Movement. You win by maneuver.
[01:17:04] You don't win by sitting still. And when you start talking about classmates and mass, it's like,
[01:17:11] we're here. Yeah. So that's again, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to like get crazy and
[01:17:20] to talk smack about classmates. Like I said, if you were a Lance Corporal at age 12, I salute you,
[01:17:26] and I will listen to what the hell you have to say 100%. But I will not, I will question anybody.
[01:17:36] I question, I question hack worth. Read my opening. Like, there's like, hey man,
[01:17:42] guy was not perfect. I mean, he's, he, you use him as the prime example of a lesson we teach
[01:17:49] in business all the time is if you lose your influence, and he and, and probably the most influential
[01:17:55] figure in your life as a leader is still your prime example of what not to do in a particular
[01:18:00] situation. So I think the contrarian component of it is, is important. What, what, what,
[01:18:04] crosswords is awesome, on war is awesome. There's a bunch of good stuff in there too.
[01:18:08] For sure. And I know that you're saying that, but just a link it back to that conversation and
[01:18:15] the human nature component and thinking about the director approach and thinking of human nature.
[01:18:21] If you just thought before you took the director approach and anything, how would I react to
[01:18:25] someone doing that to me? 99% of the director, and 99% of the director's assaults would go away.
[01:18:29] If you could just take that perspective on it, unless you lied to yourself, seriously.
[01:18:37] Yeah. Like, unless you lied to yourself, which many, many, many people will do, which is,
[01:18:42] maybe I just want Dave just to come up. Hey, if I'm wrong, just come and tell me. Yeah.
[01:18:46] Like, if you lied to yourself, then you, you probably just keep taking the director approach
[01:18:50] all the time. Yeah, which is not going to work out. And if you're, if you're the person that
[01:18:54] prides themselves in listening to other people's director's assaults on you, there's high risk
[01:18:59] through that you are lying to yourself. Check. All right. Back to the book. One defect of this
[01:19:07] definition that was the definition of of strategy, which was the art of employment of battles as
[01:19:15] means to gain the object of war. So that's Karlswitz's definition. One defect of this definition
[01:19:23] is that it intrudes on the sphere of policy or the higher conduct of war, which must necessarily
[01:19:30] be the responsibility of government and not of military leaders. It employs as its agents
[01:19:36] in the executive control of operations. So he's, he's going to go through this, but there's,
[01:19:41] you know, you know, we say all the time, you can have things to teach you all the time.
[01:19:45] That's what he's about to about to address 14 different ways. And he's going to actually go
[01:19:49] into a chapter, I don't know if we'll get there today, but there's a higher level strategy called
[01:19:54] Grand Strategy. And so he's thinking Grand Strategy policy. Another defect is that it narrows the
[01:20:02] meaning of strategy to the pure utilization of battle, thus conveying the idea that battle is the
[01:20:10] only means to the strategic end. It was an easy step for Karlswitz less profound disciples to
[01:20:17] confuse the means with the end and to reach the conclusion that in war, in every, in war,
[01:20:24] every other consideration should be subordinated to the aim of fighting a decisive battle.
[01:20:32] So, so think about that. That's your attitude is like, hey, the whole purpose of strategy is
[01:20:36] to engage in decisive battle. That's what we're doing. So then what are you doing in World War I?
[01:20:40] You put more people on the line and you put more people on the line and you put more people on
[01:20:44] line. You send another battalion, another brigade, another division over the top. That's what you do.
[01:20:51] And there's people that lead like this in companies and organizations and their families,
[01:20:57] and the way they lead is by trying to win battles. That's the way they lead.
[01:21:05] And the commitment that every argument is a decisive battle that has to be won.
[01:21:09] And not being able to recognize, and I think, I think he called them like inflection points or
[01:21:18] something along the lines of the recognition of, this is where it, this is decisive. And being
[01:21:24] able to recognize what an inflection point is in combat. As opposed to like every engagement is not
[01:21:30] an inflection point. It's not a decisive point and being able to recognize where those points are.
[01:21:33] And fighting those, as opposed to every single engagement, you mean the idea of picking your battles?
[01:21:42] Hey, pick your battles. Who's been told that before? Yeah. Hey, pick your battles.
[01:21:48] Comments seems like such common sense and yet all the time people look at every discussion,
[01:21:54] argument, contention as the decisive battle for their echo. Yeah.
[01:22:00] Relation of policy to break down the distinction between strategy and policy would not matter
[01:22:06] much if the two functions were normally combined in the same person as with Frederick or Napoleon.
[01:22:10] But, but as such, autocratic soldier rulers have been rare in modern times and became temporarily
[01:22:16] extinct for the 19th century. The effect was in city, it's the harmful for it encouraged soldiers
[01:22:21] to make preposterous claim that policy should be subservient to their conduct of operations. And
[01:22:28] especially in democratic countries, it drew statesmen onto overstep the definite border of his fear
[01:22:34] and interfere with his military employees and the actual use of their tools.
[01:22:39] So there's gotta be a line between these two things. And we gotta stay in our lanes a little bit.
[01:22:44] Hey, here's the policy. How do you want to execute it? Hey, here's the resources I need. Oh, don't
[01:22:48] know change your policy. Molky reached a clearer and wiser definition in terming strategy
[01:22:59] quote, the practical adaptation of the means placed at a general's disposal to the attainment of the
[01:23:05] object in view. Molky is another Prussian guy chief general in the 1860s and he's the guy that kind of
[01:23:17] I would say he had that the idea of the making sure you have an overall objective. I make sure that
[01:23:24] people understand what the overall objective is. The German word, Alph-Trog-Stactic. No.
[01:23:34] Overall objective. This definition fixes the responsibility of a military commander to the
[01:23:40] government by which he is employed. His responsibility is that of applying most proactively
[01:23:45] to the interest of higher war policy, the force allowed it to him within the theater of operations
[01:23:49] assigned to him. If he considers that the force allowed it is inadequate for the task indicated,
[01:23:54] he is justified in putting this out. And if his opinion is overruled, he can refuse or resign the command.
[01:24:02] But he exceeds his rightful sphere if he attempts to dictate to the government what measure
[01:24:07] force should be placed at his disposal. So like I said, there's a line here that he's talking about.
[01:24:13] On the other hand, the government which formulates war policy and has to adapt to it to
[01:24:19] conditions which often changes a war progresses can rightly intervene in the strategy of a campaign
[01:24:24] not merely by replacing a commander in whom it is lost confidence but by modifying his
[01:24:29] object according to the needs of its war policy. While it should not interfere with him and handling
[01:24:35] of his tools, it should indicate clearly the nature of his task. Thus strategy has not necessarily
[01:24:42] the simple object of seeking to overthrow the enemy's military power. When a government appreciates
[01:24:47] that the enemy has the military superiority, either in general or in a particular theater, it may
[01:24:52] be wise to enjoy a strategy of limited aim. Before I get into limited aim, let's tie this back
[01:25:00] to corporate leadership and business leadership. What are you doing if you're in charge?
[01:25:05] To make sure that you are empowering your subordinate leaders to make things happen.
[01:25:12] And not saying, hey, here's exactly how I want you to do it. Here's what I want you to do with
[01:25:16] your team. Here's what I want you to do with your tools. Here's how that's when you're crossing the line.
[01:25:20] You shouldn't have to do that. You shouldn't have to have those conversations.
[01:25:25] We should be able to say, hey Dave, this is what we're trying to make happen.
[01:25:28] How do you want to do it? And Dave, who's on the front line, says, hey boss, here's what I'm thinking.
[01:25:34] It looks good. Go execute. And by the way, Dave might come back saying to hey boss, we can't do that.
[01:25:39] Unless you give me some more resources. And I say, hey, it's all we got. Sorry. And you say,
[01:25:43] what we need to come back then, or we need to not do this market area, because we don't have the
[01:25:49] resource. We need to, okay, cool. Or maybe I say, well, I think it's just because you suck.
[01:25:54] You're fired echo. You got the con. Yeah. So let's make sure that we delineate the roles and
[01:26:00] responsibilities clearly enough that we know what what we're trying to do up and down the chain of command.
[01:26:06] Now to get back to this point of strategy of limited aim, he goes into it a little bit here.
[01:26:16] This is the strategy of limited limited limited aim. It may desire to wait until the balance of
[01:26:20] force can be changed by the intervention of allies or by the transfer of forces from another theater.
[01:26:26] It may desire to wait or even limit its military effort permanently while economic or naval
[01:26:31] action decides the issues. It may calculate that the overthrow of the enemy's military power is a
[01:26:36] task definitely beyond its capacity and not worth the effort. And that the object of its war policy
[01:26:42] can be assured by seizing territory, which it can either retrain, retain, or use as a bargaining
[01:26:48] counter when peace is negotiated. So right, every one of those things is indirect.
[01:26:53] It's a limited aim. It's like, oh, you know what? I wanted to kick Dave's ass.
[01:26:59] But he's way bigger and way better at jujitsu than I thought he was. So you know what I'm going to do?
[01:27:06] I'm on a like say, hey, man, instead of what us fighting, why don't I buy you a hamburger?
[01:27:16] And we'll talk about some stuff. And what you know what I'm saying? Like it's a different,
[01:27:19] it's just taking a different approach. It's totally different approach. We know what? I think Dave
[01:27:24] can actually kick my ass. Echo is going to be hearing about 30 minutes. Echo is bigger and stronger
[01:27:30] than Dave. He's been training more than just so I'm going to wait till hey, hey Dave, you
[01:27:34] might have to wait. I'd rather have you roll with Echo. Right, so I'm bringing in some reinforcements.
[01:27:40] That's the strategy of limited, limited aim. Such a policy has more support from history than
[01:27:44] military opinion has recognized and is less inherently a policy of weakness than some apologists.
[01:27:51] And, by so just because I say, you know what Dave, I'm not really looking to roll with your
[01:27:55] way to let go gets here. That's not necessarily weak. In fact, it might be smarter. In fact,
[01:28:03] if I think you can beat me and I'm pretty sure you're going to beat me, it's way smarter for me
[01:28:07] to wait till Echo shows up to kick your ass. It isn't indeed bound up with the history of the
[01:28:12] British Empire and repeatedly proved a life buoy to Britain's allies as well as of the permanent
[01:28:18] benefit to herself. However, unconsciously followed, there's ground for inquiry, whether this
[01:28:23] conservative military policy does not deserve to be accorded a place in the theory of the
[01:28:28] conduct of war. So how often did Britain go, you know what? Maybe we don't want to fight that war.
[01:28:34] Maybe we want to give that up. Maybe we want to give that area. Maybe we need it's bargain and
[01:28:38] move into an area that we know we can take and then we'll negotiate for it back later.
[01:28:47] The more usual reason for adopting a strategy of limited aim is that of awaiting a change in
[01:28:52] the balance of force waiting till Echo shows up. A change often sought and achieved by draining
[01:28:58] the enemies' force weakening him by tricks instead of risking blows. What if, well, you know what?
[01:29:04] Hey, Dave, I don't, you know, I don't really want to roll today. Echo is going to be here in a little while,
[01:29:08] but while you're waiting, launch a roll a couple rounds with Kerry and launch a roll a couple rounds
[01:29:12] with Dean and then so here you are fighting all these battles by the time Echo Charles shows up
[01:29:17] fresh. He's just had a discipline go. He's ready to rock and roll your tired, your nine rounds deep.
[01:29:22] That's my, that's a great plan. Great plan. So I weakened you by tricks instead of risking blows.
[01:29:30] The essential condition of strategy, such a strategy is that the drain on him should be disperse
[01:29:35] portionetly greater than all oneself because I was sitting over on the corner keeping time.
[01:29:40] That's what I was doing while you were rolling with guy after guy after guy. I'm keeping track of time for you.
[01:29:47] The object may be sought by rating his supplies by local attacks, which annihilator and flick
[01:29:52] disperse portionet loss on parts of his force by lowering him into unprofitable attacks,
[01:29:56] by causing an excessively wide distribution on his force and no least by exhausting his moral and physical
[01:30:03] energy. This is like the exact example, right? I don't think I can kick your ass, but you know what,
[01:30:08] Echo is going to be here in a little while and in the meantime, I'm going to entice, I'm going to go,
[01:30:12] hey, hey Dean, go get a couple rounds. Go, go, go get a couple rounds of Dave, boom, and just rough you up
[01:30:18] and going to hit you with a couple different people by the time Echo shows up, no factor.
[01:30:22] That's what I'm doing. Yeah, and I'm also thinking of just the idea of even going to war with
[01:30:30] the American military and most of our opponents, certainly more recent history, the aim wasn't
[01:30:35] to destroy the American military. It was to make those series of little tricks over time become
[01:30:42] intolerable where we are no longer willing to have these little successive losses. So we're not
[01:30:48] going to have that decisive campaign at all because you made this intolerable for me and that connection
[01:30:53] of policy too. We talked about that all the time of, you know, the will, you know, somebody's will
[01:30:58] to be doing that as, hey, I don't want to keep doing this over and over again. These small little
[01:31:02] things, these little, those things add up over time, as opposed to like somehow the objective is
[01:31:08] we're going to have a force on force, you know, culminating event between some military and the
[01:31:14] American military, which, which, again, generically speaking, nobody wants that. We want to have a
[01:31:19] decisive engagement with the American military. So we're going to do some other things instead
[01:31:22] and make that intolerable for us. Which, by the way, we suck in many areas of this, the United
[01:31:29] States in general, think of the propaganda damage that gets done to us on a regular basis that
[01:31:34] has been done to us on a regular basis, basically since Vietnam. Anytime we get into, I mean,
[01:31:40] anytime we get into a conflict now, the propaganda that is used to turn us against ourselves and
[01:31:47] this country is, it's, it's crazy how effective it is. You, you look at the Vietnam War,
[01:31:54] it's crazy how effective they were at turning Americans against Americans in that war. Yeah.
[01:32:05] Back to the book. This closer definition, Sheds light on the question previously raised of a
[01:32:09] General's Independence in carrying out his own strategy inside his theater of operations.
[01:32:14] For if the, for if the government has decided upon a limited aim or grand strategy, the general who,
[01:32:21] even within his strategic fear seeks to overthrow the enemy's military power, may do more harm
[01:32:27] than good to the government's war policy. So what is that saying? That saying like, I got
[01:32:31] Dave out there. He's super aggressive and he's like, you know what I'm going to, I'm going to take this whole
[01:32:34] area. And meanwhile, I'm thinking, Dave, don't take that whole area, then we're going to have to occupy it.
[01:32:37] I don't have the people to occupy it. And now we're going to cause more problems. So just because
[01:32:41] you're winning doesn't mean you're winning. Yeah. Usually a war of limited aim, a war policy
[01:32:47] of limited aim imposes the strategy of limited aim. And a decisive aim should only be adopted
[01:32:52] with the approval of the government, which alone can decide whether it is worth the candle.
[01:33:00] Old school expression. I didn't really know what it meant. I had to look it up.
[01:33:03] Worth the candle means we're going to do something is what we're doing worth the candle, that
[01:33:09] the light it's going to take to for us to be able to do whatever we're doing. Yeah.
[01:33:12] Because it weren't the candle. Like we're going to, oh, we got some work to do tonight.
[01:33:15] Cool, light the candle. But how much are we really going to get done?
[01:33:17] It's not worth the candle. It's back in the day. Kind of like it's the juice worth the squeeze.
[01:33:24] Exactly. We can now arrive at a shorter definition of strategy as quote,
[01:33:32] the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy and quote.
[01:33:40] For strategy is concerned not merely with the movement of forces as it rolls off and defined,
[01:33:47] but with the effect. When the application of the military instrument merges into actual
[01:33:54] fighting the dispositions for and control of such direct action are termed tactics. The two categories
[01:34:03] of low convenient for discussion can never be truly divided into separate compartments
[01:34:07] because each, not only influences but merges into the other, which is why leadership strategy
[01:34:13] in taxes is called leadership strategy and tactics. Kind of convenient that it worked out that way.
[01:34:18] But listen, here's what's important. Is what we're doing? It doesn't matter. What matters is
[01:34:29] how it ends up. What matters is the strategic effect. That's why we have to think strategic all the
[01:34:33] time. That's what we need to do. Next section, higher or grand strategy. As tactics in,
[01:34:44] as tactics is an application of strategy on a lower plane, so strategy is an application on a
[01:34:49] lower plane of grand strategy. So he goes to one level up, a whole other thing. We got tactical,
[01:34:55] we got operational, he isn't really talking about operational. That must be a modern thing.
[01:34:59] Tactical, operational, strategic and then grand strategy. While practically synonymous with policy,
[01:35:07] what was your, would you study in college? Policy. Thanks, what's up, man? You want to chime in a little
[01:35:13] bit. I do. Let's know. You're rolling, man. But I mean, there's so much class was he and stuff in there.
[01:35:18] But the previous comment, it was, as I'm thinking of sort of like the business alignment of this,
[01:35:24] this military concept is, how often are we engaged in tactical battles that don't
[01:35:31] promote or support the strategic goal? And I think it was, I think it was the debris podcast, but you said
[01:35:37] this is, if what you were doing, if the tactical engagement you're in supports the big picture
[01:35:46] strategy, it's not tactical, it's strategic. And if it doesn't, it's tactical and you're engaged,
[01:35:53] you shouldn't be doing it. Like how often do we dig in on these these small things that even
[01:35:58] then the end, if we win, don't reinforce the big picture goal, the objective. And how often do I
[01:36:04] on with my team, the marketing team dig in on how I want to do this, this thing and I'm going to fight
[01:36:09] with the, the sales team over resources and supplies and equipment and priority that don't actually
[01:36:15] help the company, the company achieve some sort of success. I'm being able to look at that as a
[01:36:20] leader and go and, A, A, listen, this doesn't matter. This, we don't need to dig in here, let them
[01:36:28] have this, we're playing the longer game here because what we want is the company to win. And how
[01:36:32] hard it is for us to decouple this idea that every battle is a strategic, it's not very few of
[01:36:39] my career. Absolutely. For the role of grand strategy, higher strategy is to coordinate and
[01:36:49] direct all the resources of a nation or band of nations towards the attainment of a political
[01:36:54] object of the war, the goal defined by fundamental policy. Grand strategies should both
[01:37:00] calculate and develop to economic resources and manpower of nations in order to sustain fighting
[01:37:06] services also the moral resources. For the foster, the people's willing spirit is often as important
[01:37:15] as to possess more concrete forms of power, which is why you need to pay attention to what's going
[01:37:20] on in your country when it comes to propaganda that's being used against you. Grand strategy
[01:37:25] too should regulate the distribution of power between the several services and between the services
[01:37:31] and industry. Moreover, fighting power is but one of the instruments of grand strategy, which
[01:37:39] should take account of and apply the power of financial pressure, diplomatic pressure, commercial
[01:37:46] pressure and least of ethical pressure to weaken the opponent's will. A good cause is a sword as
[01:37:56] well as armor. Likewise, shivalry in war can be a most effective weapon in weakening the opponent's
[01:38:06] will to resist as well as augmenting moral strength. This is why we always say take the high ground
[01:38:13] of the high ground. Take the high ground of the good causes as a sword as well as armor.
[01:38:22] When you give up the high ground, when you get down into the mud and I think there's a quote,
[01:38:28] you references when you get down into the mud, you're not getting muddy because somebody's
[01:38:32] throwing mud at you is because you went down there and how hard it is once you've got up the
[01:38:37] high ground to get back up onto the high ground. When you give that up, back to the book further
[01:38:47] more while the horizon of strategy is bounded by the war. Grand strategy looks beyond the war
[01:38:54] to the subsequent peace. It should not only combine the various instruments but so regulate their
[01:39:00] use as to avoid damage to the future state of peace for its security and prosperity. The
[01:39:05] sorry state of peace for both sides that is followed most wars can be traced to the fact that
[01:39:10] unlike strategy, the realm of grand strategy is for the most part Terra in Kognita.
[01:39:18] Still awaiting exploration and understanding that means unknown territory. So this is
[01:39:24] this is beyond thinking strategic and it's kind of the way we turn thinking strategic you know
[01:39:30] if you and I have a relationship and I'm going to bark in order you where does that get me?
[01:39:33] Even if you do that thing where does it put us in the future? How is our relationship?
[01:39:39] If we have a client and we decide you know what we're going to bill them anyways even though they
[01:39:43] didn't you know they didn't participate but we're going to bill them anyways. How's that
[01:39:47] gonna work out for us to cool? We get a little bit more money right now. How does that how does that
[01:39:52] affect us in a year when that client needs help? So the grand strategy looks beyond the war to
[01:39:59] subsequent peace. How often are we doing that? Looking further in the future.
[01:40:09] Goes into pure or military strategy. Having cleared the ground we can build up our conception
[01:40:16] of strategy on its proper plane and original basis that of the art of the general. Strategy depends
[01:40:23] for success first and foremost, first and foremost, first sorry first and most on a sound
[01:40:29] calculation and coordination of the ends and means of the end and means. The end must be
[01:40:38] proportioned to the total means and the means used in gaining each intermediate end which
[01:40:44] contributes to the ultimate must be proportioned to the value and the needs of that intermediate
[01:40:50] end whether it be to gain an objective or fulfill a contributory purpose and excess may be as harmful
[01:41:01] as a deficiency. So that's first of all that's a freaking run on sentence but what's the second
[01:41:08] fall? But second of all it's important because what he's saying is you should constantly be assessing
[01:41:14] if if the juice is worked the squeeze you should constantly be saying like listen we're going to
[01:41:18] put this much effort towards this client or going to put this much effort towards this relationship
[01:41:22] we're going to put this much effort towards this team who's we don't know how they're going to do
[01:41:27] so you constantly have to check yourself if the end that you're going towards is your investment
[01:41:34] worth it. What's the ROI? And by the way spending too much it can be as bad as not spending enough
[01:41:41] totally and and spending a much to to win a particular battle or win a particular war but you
[01:41:48] spent so much that you look around and go well that was not the juice wasn't worth the squeeze
[01:41:54] wasn't worth the candle yeah what are we accomplished and that that next level up to grand strategy
[01:42:00] and of course I think the connection he's making is on this large scale man I literally took a
[01:42:04] class called American grand strategy and the military is a is a component of all these other
[01:42:11] things you named a bunch of them diplomatic you know uh uh uh eacon obviously it's a whole bunch of
[01:42:14] different tools that are inside there that are actually you know they're all connected but the
[01:42:18] military is one arm of that one of many of course you're in uniform you think the whole world
[01:42:23] of all's round military power we know we say it all the time we know that's not true but an example
[01:42:28] that you use we all the time and in just trying to explain this idea of utilizing resources and
[01:42:34] making decisions when you talk about means our means everybody has limited means we don't have
[01:42:39] unlimited means or unlimited resources and if I'm looking at this particular area that
[01:42:44] I want to open up a shop here open up a couple of locations and this physical you know this
[01:42:48] geographic area to compete with our uh competitors and I take all of my resources every penny I've
[01:42:55] got every tool I've got and I get in there co-baker go home that's right and in the end we get in there
[01:43:01] we get in that region and I don't know it doesn't quite work out or even if it does but we now have
[01:43:05] no other tools and resources do anything else the larger piece that is the strategy isn't to get
[01:43:12] into that area the strategy is actually to make our company stronger and that limited understanding
[01:43:19] or that understanding being limited of hey we're here to take over this region if that is not
[01:43:23] connected to the company being successful that larger piece of it all the all the means are all the
[01:43:29] resources to getting into that area they don't help you. It's a waste you burn that candle yeah
[01:43:35] yeah and you know what's interesting is from a leadership this is a total this is a leadership
[01:43:41] capital discussion right it's hey is it worth me expanding this leadership capital on getting
[01:43:48] gave to follow my order on getting gave to you know pick up a client that I know is going to be
[01:43:54] painful and I'm forcing them to do it and whatever whatever the case may be is it worth that leadership
[01:43:59] capital we we have to weigh that out and you know when you were talking about oh we got the the
[01:44:04] diplomatic we got the the commercial pressure the financial pressure the ethical pressure all those
[01:44:10] things and the military's part of that guess what in from a leadership perspective the military
[01:44:17] thing is hey this is my rank I outrank you and we're just going to go by force that's what
[01:44:21] course that should be there's six seven eight twelve other components that I can utilize as a
[01:44:25] leader to make something happen and the worst one to use the one that cost me the most leadership
[01:44:30] capital is the military one which is my rank which is hey on the boss you should you listen to me
[01:44:35] to to compel someone through the threat of force as you're only tool to get them to comply the
[01:44:42] threat of force and even you know the the the moral high ground I mean how convenient would it be
[01:44:49] if you and I are in a situation looking at something and mine was the moral approach and yours
[01:44:53] is the immoral approach which requires no money no time no resources no equipment to go oh you know
[01:44:59] I hey listen if we do this we take the if we take the unethical and we get found out and
[01:45:04] someone just goes oh hey man you're right you know you look listen man I was you're right we
[01:45:10] we need to do just we just need to do the right thing here the the the strategic win from that alone
[01:45:17] or the obstinate of the spectrum the military end is I come I threw force and demand and through
[01:45:24] risk of of destruction yeah is how I'm getting you to to behave in a way that helps the team yeah
[01:45:31] I've got this quote later on and I don't even remember where I got the quote from but I talked
[01:45:35] about on this podcast maybe I talked about it in your phone line it's it's something along
[01:45:39] the lines of cool you win and now you're in charge of a wasteland great oh yeah you won the
[01:45:45] war cold now you have burnt scorched earth that's what you have cool good job what did you win nothing
[01:45:51] yeah back to the book a true all this is a true adjustment would establish a perfect economy of force
[01:46:01] in the deeper sense of that off distorted military term so all the time we heard the term you know
[01:46:07] economy of force but because of the nature and uncertainty of war and uncertainty increased by
[01:46:14] lack of scientific study even the greatest military ability could not achieve a true adjustment
[01:46:20] and success lies in the closest approximation to the truth again his use the word truth is a little
[01:46:26] bit is a little bit broad but what he's talking about is like how much should I apply to this how
[01:46:31] much force should I apply we want to apply the minimum force required but we're not going to be
[01:46:35] perfect with that so we want to get his closest we can this relativity is inherent because however
[01:46:42] our knowledge and of the science of war be extended it will depend on the art for its application
[01:46:48] art cannot only bring the end near to the means but by giving a higher value to the means and
[01:46:54] enable the end to be extended this complicates calculation because no man can exactly calculate the
[01:47:03] capacity of human genius and stupidity nor the incapacity of will so there's all these things
[01:47:12] that we have to account for as leaders you know and we're and we're not going to get it perfectly right
[01:47:18] but how close can we get it? Next section elements and conditions in strategy however
[01:47:26] calculation is simpler and a closer approximation to truth possible than in tactics so this is a very
[01:47:33] interesting point it's easier to calculate big broad strategic things because you're a little bit
[01:47:39] further away from the human component for an war the chief and calculs is human will which
[01:47:47] manifests itself in resistance which in turn lies in the province of tactics strategy has not to
[01:47:52] overcome resistance except from nature its purposes to diminish the possibility of resistance
[01:47:58] and it seeks to fulfill this purpose by exploiting the elements of movement and surprise
[01:48:03] now that's cool and everything I would say that there's definitely that's a stretch because we've seen
[01:48:11] collect the collective will of a people change the outcome of strategic situations for sure
[01:48:20] so even though I said hey it's it's closer to it still can have a huge impact I mean
[01:48:27] look at Vietnam it was like oh well we can beat them because we can kill 150 Vietnamese soldiers
[01:48:33] and via Kong soldiers for every one of our people that killed so well win no actually we won't win
[01:48:37] because guess what the act their collective will is freaking incredibly strong yeah
[01:48:46] but movement and surprise movement lies in the physical sphere and depends on calculation
[01:48:53] of the conditions of the time topography and transport capacity by transport capacities meant both
[01:48:58] of both the means by which and the measure in which force can be moved to maintain okay so there's
[01:49:03] the physical sphere sphere of movement surprise lies in the psychological sphere and depends on
[01:49:10] a calculation of far more difficult than in the physical sphere of the manifold conditions varying
[01:49:15] in each case which are likely to affect the will of the opponent so you got two things you've
[01:49:22] got movement and you've got surprise this is how we're gonna kind of win this is how we're gonna
[01:49:26] win by movement and surprise movement physical surprise psychological although strategy may
[01:49:32] a more at exploiting movement than at exploiting surprise or conversely the two elements react
[01:49:40] on each other so even though they're different spheres they're still closely woven together
[01:49:47] movement generates surprise and surprise gives impetus to movement so this is jujitsu right if you
[01:49:53] surprise somebody they have to react to it so you can make someone move by surprising them with
[01:49:58] something for a movement which is accelerated or changes its direction inevitably carries with it
[01:50:03] a degree of surprise even though it be concealed while surprise smooths the path of movement
[01:50:10] by hindering the enemies countermeasures and counter movements so if I surprise you don't
[01:50:14] on time to react to you're not defending it yeah this obviously not something this guy was
[01:50:24] thinking about when I think about flying and stealth airplanes the psychology of that is
[01:50:29] what I what I have discovered and it's true not just an airplane and true in every situation
[01:50:34] more often than not people's reaction to being surprised is not the right reaction they don't
[01:50:39] usually react well even when they react it's still like an overreaction under reaction
[01:50:42] think about how you react it when you're surprised are those usually like good smooth effective
[01:50:49] responses 100% yeah all the time and when when you look at stealth airplanes the advent of
[01:50:58] Americans showing up with stealth airplanes and and sort of the culminating event really was in
[01:51:01] desert storm when nobody even knew we had them and all of a sudden stealth airplanes are over
[01:51:06] bad dad dropping bombs and the Iraqis didn't under they did not understand what was happening
[01:51:12] and the reaction was obviously wrong now you know that they're proliferated that's why
[01:51:17] an un a significantly undersized force when you're flying around the stealth aircraft
[01:51:22] and then I'm fighting against you and your conventional aircraft and the first call you here
[01:51:25] is hey the the first four of your airplanes are all dead and and the psychological response to that
[01:51:32] is almost always the wrong response the reaction they they behave eratically they move
[01:51:36] and different right they they don't know what to do the psychological response to surprise is
[01:51:40] almost always the wrong reaction and the power of creating that reaction your opponents is really
[01:51:49] hard to overstate and that's really one of the things that stealth airplanes have allowed us to do
[01:51:53] is get our opponents to behave incorrectly to give us an even more of an advantage you're going to
[01:51:59] off balance them somehow because what you just said when you say they either overreactor under
[01:52:03] react guess what you either you're off balance right a balanced measured response would be like
[01:52:08] okay we didn't really get them off balance but you either overreactor you under react
[01:52:12] and through surprise you cause them to move to far in one direction too far in the other
[01:52:16] direction that's what's going to happen and that's what we're going to take advantage of and you've
[01:52:19] explained this a ton like if I attack your arm and you under react to a point where you do not
[01:52:26] almost don't react at all and you just let me have it then I may actually culminate with an arm bar
[01:52:32] but more than likely you're going to overreact and I want you to overreact in it so I can attack
[01:52:36] something else but it's like you said it's it's the lack of a balance response it's usually an
[01:52:41] overreaction usually that reveals a weakness somewhere else that I can then explain you know
[01:52:49] as regards the relation of strategy attacks while in execution the border line is often shadowy
[01:52:56] and it is difficult to decide exactly where a strategic movement ends and a tactical movement begins
[01:53:01] yet in conception the two are distinct tactics lies in the fills tactics lies and fills the
[01:53:09] province of fighting strategy not only stops on the frontier but has for its purpose the reduction of
[01:53:16] fighting by the slendorist possible proportions so the purpose of strategies to not fight
[01:53:24] because on with the aim of strategy this statement may be disputed by those who conceive
[01:53:33] the destruction of the enemies armed force as the only sound aim in war who hold that the only
[01:53:39] goal of strategy is battle and who obsessed with the clouds vizzi and saying that blood is the
[01:53:45] price of victory yet if one should concede this point and meet its advocates on their own ground
[01:53:52] the statement would remain unshaken for even if decisive battle be the goal the aim of strategy
[01:53:58] must be to bring about this battle under the most advantageous circumstances and the more
[01:54:04] advantageous the circumstances the less proportionally will be the fighting so whole goal of strategies
[01:54:10] we're not fighting that's what we're doing the perfection of strategy would be therefore to produce a
[01:54:16] decision without any serious fighting history now think about that from a leadership perspective
[01:54:23] I never get an argument because Dave's doing what I need him to do to make it happen
[01:54:30] that's the most effective strategy it's not how do I outwit David and argument that doesn't matter
[01:54:36] why am I having an argument history as we have seen provides examples where strategy help by
[01:54:42] favorable conditions has virtually produced such a result and he goes through some examples here
[01:54:50] and again he's recalling back to some of the examples that he talks about in the book
[01:54:56] while these cases where the destruction of the enemy's forces the enemies armed forces
[01:55:01] was economically achieved through the disarming by surrender such destruction may not be essential
[01:55:09] for a decision and for the fulfillment of the war aim in the case of a state that is seeking
[01:55:14] not conquest but maintenance of its security the aim is fulfilled if the threat be removed
[01:55:21] if the enemy is led to abandon his purpose with such while such blood this victories have been exceptional
[01:55:30] their rarity enhances rather than detracts from their value
[01:55:34] as an indication of latent potentialities in strategy and grand strategy despite many
[01:55:42] centuries of experience of war we have hardly begun to explore the field of psychological warfare
[01:55:49] from deep study of war clouse fits was led to the conclusion that quote all military action is
[01:55:56] permeated by intelligent forces and their effects
[01:55:59] nevertheless and quote nevertheless nations at war have always driven or been driven by their
[01:56:06] passions to disregard the implications of such a conclusion instead of applying intelligence they
[01:56:12] have chosen to batter their heads against the nearest wall so here's Karlswick's okay it's
[01:56:19] it's an intelligence you know what doing but all the time we countries people leaders teams
[01:56:28] we get we do stupid things we bang our head against the nearest wall because we get emotional
[01:56:32] we're not intelligent and we gotta look out for that
[01:56:40] it rests normally with the government responsible for the grand strategy of awarded decide
[01:56:44] whether strategy should make its contribution by achieving a military decision or otherwise
[01:56:49] just as military means is only one of the means to the end of grand strategy one of the instruments
[01:56:55] in the surgeon's case so battle is only one of the means to the end of strategy
[01:57:03] if the conditions are suitable it usually it is usually the quickest and effect
[01:57:08] but if conditions are unfavorable it's a folly to use so cool you can go to battle
[01:57:12] but if you haven't prepared for it and you don't have the advantage it's stupid
[01:57:18] let's assume that a strategist is empowered to seek a military decision his responsibility is to
[01:57:23] seek it under the most advantageous circumstances in order to produce the most profitable result
[01:57:29] hence his true aim is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation so
[01:57:36] advantageous that if it does not of itself produce the decision its continuation by battle is sure to
[01:57:43] achieve this so we're not engaging in battles that we don't know we're gonna win and if we
[01:57:50] know we're gonna win them why can't we convince them opponent that we're gonna win and they
[01:57:54] bow down in other words dislocation is the aim of strategy it's sequel maybe either the
[01:58:02] enemy's dissolution or his easier disruption in battle dissolution may involve some
[01:58:10] partial measure of fighting but this is not but this is not the character of battle so that's
[01:58:16] what we're trying to do we're trying to win the fight without fighting we're trying to win the
[01:58:21] argument without having it I'm trying to get Dave what I to do what I wanted to do without
[01:58:25] him even knowing that that's what I want to do it's with his idea yeah and think about that statement
[01:58:32] about you getting me to do do it do it you want me to get done without fighting with me
[01:58:38] and take a step away from this book which is talking about fighting your enemies like your
[01:58:44] literal enemies to someone on your team my team my guy yeah because the human nature doesn't
[01:58:52] change it doesn't change if we're in the jungle desert if we're in if there's an old 42 if we're
[01:58:58] in 1916 if we're in 1942 it doesn't matter if you're my enemy or you're my friend if there's
[01:59:05] a component of human will then we need to utilize these principles effectively.
[01:59:15] Next section action of strategy how is the strategic dislocation produced
[01:59:22] in the physical or logistical sphere it is the result of a move which a upsets the enemies
[01:59:27] dispositions and by compelling a sudden change of front dislocates the distribution and
[01:59:31] organization of his forces be separates his forces kind of got a little little little little
[01:59:39] tingle in my spine when I saw that and dangers his supplies
[01:59:44] de-menaces the root or roots by which he could retreat in case of need and reestablish himself on
[01:59:51] the base so this there's these ways that we can cause strategic dislocation
[01:59:55] a dislocation may be produced by one of these effects but is more often a consequence of several
[02:00:02] right we're going to we're going to dislocate them from multiple different directions
[02:00:06] differentiation indeed is difficult because a move directed toward the enemies rear tends to combine
[02:00:12] these effects their respective influence however varies and has varied throughout history according
[02:00:18] the size of armaged and complexities of their organization with armies which live on the country
[02:00:23] drawing their supplies locally by plunder or requisition the line of communication has negligible
[02:00:28] importance so if you got an army that's out there living off the land they kind of know what they're
[02:00:31] doing you can't you can't really cut their supply lines because they don't have any
[02:00:36] even if a higher even in a higher stage of military development the smaller a force the
[02:00:41] less dependent it is on the lines of communication for supplies for larger an army and more
[02:00:46] complex its organization the more prompt and serious in effect is a menace to its line of
[02:00:51] communication so depending on who you're fighting you gotta make some adjustments
[02:00:55] where armies have not been so dependent strategies been correspondingly handicapped and the
[02:01:00] technically issue of battle has played a greater part nevertheless even thus handicapped able
[02:01:06] strategists have frequently gained a decisive advantage previous to battle by menacing the
[02:01:12] enemies lines of retreat the equilibrium of his dispositions or his local supplies so we're doing
[02:01:17] so we're we're throwing people off the spy mess and we're just supply chain by messing with
[02:01:22] their communication and by the way I'm probably gonna mention it's 15 15 thousand more times
[02:01:28] he's talking all the time about disrupting your enemies communication each one of those is the red cell
[02:01:38] the red team for us to go man am I communicating properly every time you hear that's one of the
[02:01:46] main ways that the indirect approach works is by disrupting the enemy communication what is that
[02:01:53] tell us about our communication it tells us it's freaking critical he goes into some some
[02:02:05] talk about how to disrupt communication to be effective such a menace usually must be applied at
[02:02:11] a point closer in time and space to the enemy's army than a menace to his communication
[02:02:17] and thus early in warfare it's often difficult to distinguish between strategic and tactical maneuver
[02:02:23] in the psychological sphere dislocation is the result of the impression on the commander's mind
[02:02:28] of the physical effects which we have listed the impression is strongly accentuated if his realization
[02:02:35] of being at a disadvantage is sudden and if he feels that he is unable to counter an enemy's move
[02:02:41] psychological dislocation fundamentally springs from his sense of being trapped
[02:02:48] that's straight out of like the jujitsu world and this is important so we feel
[02:02:58] we feel dislocated we feel nervous when we get trapped guess what you should never do as a leader
[02:03:04] hey Dave I know you want to do this but what if that happens why am I trapping him
[02:03:10] why am I trapping you don't trap people that are on your team that's another little red cell
[02:03:17] little red team if you're if I set you up to trap you you're gonna be uncomfortable you're gonna
[02:03:22] get defensive you're gonna be unstable and my interest in interacting with you the next time
[02:03:28] you know like oh here we go let's see what what jacco's gonna try to do to me this time
[02:03:34] talking about loyalty and respect and the things that you actually want from me in the end
[02:03:37] you know when when when you're the leader that likes to set your people up so you can hammer them
[02:03:45] dude that's a classic like I won that argument cool and that argument man I don't have to
[02:03:50] even like a gypshoon that meeting good job he won't want to step up again
[02:03:55] this is the reason why it is most frequently followed a physical move on the enemy's rear
[02:04:01] an army like a man cannot properly defend its back from a blow without turning around to use
[02:04:07] its arms in a new direction turning temporarily unbalances an army as it does a man and with the
[02:04:13] former the period of instability is inevitably much longer in consequence the brain is much more
[02:04:18] sensitive to any menace to its back this is why in jacco what are we trying to do we're trying
[02:04:22] to attack the back that's why in the battlefield we're trying to we're trying to come around to the
[02:04:25] rear because they have to maneuver and face you and they're exposed in contrast to move directly
[02:04:34] on an opponent consolidates his balance physical and psychologically and by consolidating it
[02:04:40] increases his resisting power when I attack you from the front you know exactly what's
[02:04:45] that coming at you and you can resist it more what does that mean from the leadership perspective
[02:04:54] that means that I I don't want to have you resist my ideas by coming right at you
[02:05:07] for in the case of an army it rolls the enemy back towards the reserve supplies and reinforcement
[02:05:13] so the original front is driven back and warn thin new layers are added to the back so
[02:05:16] when you if you make the enemy retreat well guess what this is what the Russians did to Napoleon and to
[02:05:20] the Nazis we're just gonna retreat yeah yeah you could job you beat us today cool we just got closer
[02:05:25] to our supply chain yeah we just got more reinforcements our communication lines got got shorter
[02:05:32] you made our job easier at the most it imposes a strain rather than producing a shock
[02:05:38] thus a move around the enemy's rear against the move around the enemy's front against his rear
[02:05:44] has the aim not only avoiding resistance on its way but in its issue in the profound
[02:05:50] distance it takes the line of least resistance the equivalent in this psychological sphere is the
[02:05:57] line of least expectation they are two faces of the same coin this is to widen our understanding of
[02:06:03] strategy if we merely take what obviously appears the line of least resistance its obvious
[02:06:09] ness will appeal to the opponent also and this line may no longer be the line of least resistance
[02:06:16] used it when we used to go on weak hands reconnaissance missions and we'd get put on
[02:06:20] reconnaissance missions like I camp penaltent and you get up to camp penaltent and you're
[02:06:24] supposed to be observing some area and there's a one spot to observe there's like one bush
[02:06:31] you're like we can it's so tempting to go to that bush we guess exactly where the they're
[02:06:37] going to look they're going to look at that bush so you're better off digging a hole doing
[02:06:41] whatever you got to do taking the worst looking bush you know there's four bushes three of them are
[02:06:46] pretty good one of them socks go to the one that sucks
[02:06:54] in studying the physical aspect we must never lose sight of those psychological and when both are
[02:06:59] combined is the strategy truly an indirect approach calculated dislocate the opponent's balance
[02:07:07] the mere action of marching indirectly toward the enemy and on the rear of his dispositions
[02:07:12] is not constituted the strategic indirect approach so just because you try and come around the rear
[02:07:16] doesn't mean because if that's what they think you're going to do it doesn't matter strategic
[02:07:20] card is not so simple such an approach may start by being an indirect relation to an enemy's front
[02:07:25] but by the very directness of its progress towards the rear may allow the enemy to change
[02:07:29] his dispositions so that soon becomes a direct approach on a new front check
[02:07:36] because of the risk that the enemy may achieve such a change of front it is usually necessary
[02:07:41] for the dislocating move to be preceded by a move or moves which can best be defined as the term
[02:07:50] distract in a literal sense to draw a sunder so we have to do multiple moves just like in
[02:07:57] jujitsu you can't just do one move you can't recently you can't really even just do two you
[02:08:00] got to do multiple moves to make the enemy not sure what's really important what's really going on
[02:08:06] and you know I was I was doing a little bit of research because I always people will sometimes bring
[02:08:11] up d day what about d day front all assault right yep yeah kind of guess what the deception
[02:08:20] that the allied forces did to make Hitler and the Nazis unaware I think it was something like
[02:08:28] I don't think Hitler committed all of his forces to Normandy for seven weeks because they were
[02:08:34] expecting general patent that was the whole big scam like hey we got patent he's going to come in
[02:08:39] this other spot and and so for seven weeks the Nazis were like no don't commit so even though it was
[02:08:46] they looked like a direct assault there was a massive fake going on that that Germany didn't commit
[02:08:53] their forces for seven weeks that's crazy so it looked like a frontal assault I get it but man
[02:09:00] there was some distraction going on well just like he was he was just saying it's it's it's only
[02:09:06] a frontal assault if the enemy recognizes this is a frontal assault and then lines up his defenses
[02:09:11] against that frontal assault and the psychology of that the human nature reaction is the thing
[02:09:17] that actually matters the most is your response to my interaction and if you think it's a frontal
[02:09:23] assault they're going to react like it's a frontal assault and you're going to dig in and it was like
[02:09:28] something's going something's going on here and like actually it's a frontal assault you don't know
[02:09:32] it's a yeah it's a isn't a frontal assault it's a flank because they are putting their defenses elsewhere
[02:09:36] yeah the purpose of this distraction is to deprive the enemy of his freedom of action and it should
[02:09:42] operate both the physical and psychological fear spheres in the physical it should cause a
[02:09:47] distension of his forces or their diversion to unprofit lens of that they are too widely distributed
[02:09:54] and to commit it elsewhere who's exactly what D.A. was to have the power of interfering with one's
[02:10:00] own decisively intended move which was we're going to hit it in the psychological fear sphere
[02:10:05] the same effect is sought by playing upon the fears this the fears of and by deceiving the opposing
[02:10:11] command stone wall jacks an athlete of expressed this in his strategic gomato mystify mislead and
[02:10:18] surprise for to mystify and mislead constitutes distraction while surprise is the essential cause of
[02:10:24] dislocation is through the distraction of the commander's mind that the distraction of his forces
[02:10:30] follows the loss of his freedom of action is the sequel to the loss of his freedom of conception
[02:10:39] a more profound appreciation of how the psychological permeates and dominates the physical
[02:10:44] fear sphere has an indirect value for it warns us of the fallacy and shallowness of attempting to
[02:10:51] analyze and theorize about strategy in terms of mathematics to treat it quantitatively as if
[02:11:00] the issue turned merely on superior concentration of force at a selected place is as faulty as
[02:11:07] to treat it geometrically as a matter of lines and angles not just numbers even more remote from the
[02:11:18] truth because in practice it usually leads to a dead end is the tendency of textbooks to treat war
[02:11:25] as mainly a matter of concentrating superior force in his celebrated definition of economy of force
[02:11:32] fock termed this the art of pouring out all one's resources at a given moment on one spot of making
[02:11:42] use there of all truths and to make such a thing possible of making those troops permanently
[02:11:48] communicate with each other instead of dividing them and attaching to each fraction some fixed
[02:11:54] in invariable function its second part a result having been attained is the art of again so
[02:12:00] disposing the troops as to converge upon and act against a single new objective and quote
[02:12:09] it would have been so there's the there's the economy force like hey we're going to put all of our
[02:12:15] forces in the right spot at the right time which we all know we learn that all the time and that's
[02:12:21] part of prioritize an execute that is part of prioritize an execute is listen you got multiple things
[02:12:26] you need to concentrate your forces on unobjective efficiently it would have been more exact and
[02:12:34] he's kind of take upon a little a little hit on this quote from from fock who by the way this is
[02:12:41] burden and a burden and fock this is the the French allied commander world war one so we kind of
[02:12:50] already aren't super stoked on him because guess what he did he carried out his strategy
[02:12:56] hey well gotta get more forces as we're gonna do concentrate all force will be blow that whistle
[02:13:00] we're gonna break through this time no here's why it would have been more exact and more lucid to
[02:13:08] say that an army should always be so distributed distributed that its parts can aid each other
[02:13:15] and combine to produce the maximum possible concentration of force at one place while the minimum
[02:13:23] force necessary is used elsewhere to prepare the success of the concentration this is what
[02:13:30] cover movies this is what cover movies is you and and there's a doctrinal term and I used to tell
[02:13:37] this the young seals is a doctrinal term called supporting distance and what supporting distance is you
[02:13:45] Dave and me your platoon and my platoon or your company and my company or your battalion and my
[02:13:50] battalion we aren't gonna get so far apart that we can't support each other so that means if
[02:13:55] if we only have rifles we're gonna be 400 500 yards from each other you know depending on the
[02:14:00] terrain if the terrain is you know mountainous or we might be closer than that because I want to
[02:14:05] be able to provide support to you if we have mortars cool now we can stretch it out a little bit more
[02:14:10] if we have our teller we can stretch it out even more but we need to be able to
[02:14:16] cover and move for each other we need to be able to support each other and if we get too far apart
[02:14:22] you're alone man we had a term that we got to coin it was called fluid mutual support
[02:14:28] which is we when you say we got to coin this expand bro it's so this is when you can
[02:14:33] good deal Dave well over here making stuff up listen well listen when we at Top Guns
[02:14:38] figured out like we used to have just superior equipment superior technology better machines more
[02:14:45] of them they worked better and we were fighting and I think I talked about this a while ago we were
[02:14:50] firing and fighting an inferior opponent to be totally honest with you our tactics were kind of
[02:14:55] straightforward they just wasn't that complicated and we didn't just like barge right in there and
[02:14:59] fight them but you know our tactics relied on the fact that in the end our stuff was better than
[02:15:04] your stuff and it's flown correctly well over time we couldn't rely on that anymore they're
[02:15:09] equipment got better than ours they were able to do things we couldn't do and what we had to
[02:15:12] start doing is taking that same equipment and start to utilize them differently and one of
[02:15:17] things we had to get away from was cover move for airplanes used to be a thousand feet away
[02:15:21] 2000 feet away and you stay together I turn you turn you I go you go and your job is a wingman
[02:15:26] and how I grated your performance as a wingman as how well you stayed inside that what we called
[02:15:31] visual visual visual sports and if you lost sight of me believe me we you were going to hear about
[02:15:37] in the debrief and what we evolved to was because of inferior equipment we had to actually get
[02:15:47] farther away from each other so in simple as terms we could figure out who is the person who is
[02:15:54] the aircraft in the formation that was fundamentally the most at risk or the most likely to be engaged
[02:16:00] and the other aircraft could then flank or maneuver or come in from a different three-dimensional
[02:16:05] direction to support that person and it was fluid because it changed it wasn't exactly on the 35 degree
[02:16:13] bearing line at five miles it evolved based on weather based on weapons based in the formation
[02:16:19] and just like you described it and I had to know and if I got too far away I couldn't support you and if I was too close to
[02:16:25] you I couldn't maneuver in a way that allowed me to have an advantageous entry to the problem I flank
[02:16:32] because I was too close to you and while you were talking about that I was just thinking of
[02:16:37] the French approach to older one this culminating thing versus just the standard combined arms effect
[02:16:43] oh cool I don't need a million tanks I got a couple tanks so you don't want to rock
[02:16:46] to the tanks cool they're going to run you over you want to rock to the tanks cool come
[02:16:49] out your holes we're going to get your their children you don't want to deal with their
[02:16:51] artillery you're going to dig in cool I'll roll over the aircraft and I don't need an
[02:16:55] overwhelming force of any of those three but I need them together in support of one another
[02:17:01] and I don't know in the end who's going to get the kill or who's going to be the reason why I'm
[02:17:04] successful but you're going to have to react to something and if you don't one of those different
[02:17:09] arms those different supporting elements will eventually be the thing that causes you to lose
[02:17:13] supporting distance covered move and and now fluid mutual support we better I'm going to do it
[02:17:25] I should have known that I was going to totally submarine your goals of getting through this by
[02:17:29] talking way too much I planned for this so we'll wrap it up with another paragraph and then we'll
[02:17:36] we'll do the next on the next podcast here's where he's going to break down Fox statement a little
[02:17:43] bit he says wind because Fox said the art of pouring all one's resources so so ladel hard says
[02:17:52] the concentrate all is an unrealizable ideal and dangerous even as a hyperbole
[02:17:59] moreover in practice the minimum necessary maybe a far larger portion of the total
[02:18:06] than maximum possible they would even be true to say that the larger the force that is effectively
[02:18:11] used for distraction of the enemy the greater the chance of the concentration succeeding in its aim
[02:18:18] for otherwise it may strike an object to solid to be shattered this is like um
[02:18:26] in jujitsu if you if I try and sweep you but it's I'm not really trying to sweep you you don't even
[02:18:33] have to react to it I have to really try and sweep you then if I really try and sweep you then you
[02:18:38] expose your neck boom cool you stick your neck out to you you know you push into me and boom there's
[02:18:43] your neck I can get the guillotine if I don't actually put enough force to get but if I put too much
[02:18:49] force into that well and you defend it well well now I've used a bunch of energy didn't work
[02:18:54] and how often am I going to do that so we have to be careful and what he's saying is you want to
[02:19:00] use it's what we talk a lot about a lot about edescalum front which is minimum force required
[02:19:05] well like how much force do I need to use to get you to react and if if I only have to use you know
[02:19:12] 10% of my force over here to get you to react that means I have 90% of my force to finish
[02:19:17] you finish the job on the flank closing this out superior weight at the intended decisive
[02:19:23] point does not suffice unless that point cannot be reinforced in time by the opponent
[02:19:30] yeah you can you can put a bunch I can go for your arm but if you're going to grab with your
[02:19:34] other arm and defend it well it doesn't matter that I singled out your arm it rarely suffices
[02:19:39] unless that point is not merely weaker numerically but has been weakened morally
[02:19:45] Napoleon suffered some of his worst checks because he neglected this guarantee and the need for
[02:19:51] distraction has grown with the delaying power of weapons so there you go that's a warm-up
[02:20:01] with almost two and a half hours deep right now we're talking it's it's only going to get deeper from here
[02:20:08] let's let's call it for right now let's get into some I don't know echo Charles maybe the
[02:20:15] anything any closing statement safe all right let's let's roll into a little little quick activity with
[02:20:22] you know maybe a little bit of support sure you know I know we're trying to be indirect but
[02:20:29] maybe there's some direct ways we can kind of help ourselves out sure what you got or some help in our
[02:20:36] on our path which includes being indirect as far as effectiveness goes concur yeah so let's talk
[02:20:43] with our friend Kerry and you and I just kind of come to realize that this path is not that hard anymore
[02:20:51] it's hard but it's not as hard you're taking my Vapath that we're all on and okay I didn't know that
[02:20:58] this was like the path just got easy little bit easier okay more easier yeah easier it's not
[02:21:02] easy all that's hard still but it's easier in this way juggle fuel boom this is why you drink
[02:21:09] energy drinks that's no longer a problem if you're on the path and you're like into energy drinks
[02:21:13] right get to get real those and sometimes it'll take will power understand you know at the very
[02:21:18] least in adjustment period that might not be very comfortable yeah let's not like that anymore
[02:21:23] and drink all energy drinks you on anymore just plain go and drink good for you boom path easier
[02:21:29] yeah right that adjust I have to concur the path just got easier that goes with the correct
[02:21:34] it's sure also we want to have dessert right yeah well if you're on the path what's
[02:21:40] you gotta start excluding dessert from time to time in fact pretty much all the time on the path
[02:21:46] yeah the occasional dessert can happen I mean yeah I mean my daughter's birthday yesterday
[02:21:54] yes I understand oh but I was at Ragland which is kind of one of my go to
[02:21:59] right it might be my favorite restaurant yeah and they have that that cast iron pan with the
[02:22:06] talk it's yeah they call it the illegal yeah it's good they're like it's so good it should be illegal
[02:22:12] yeah good name so we had to order some illegal from my daughter's birthday yeah it's a birthday
[02:22:18] right did that illegal girl right so when it showed up the ice cream just melts in the pan
[02:22:25] dude it's a whole no situation yeah I understand well let's face it to your point we can't be doing
[02:22:30] that you know every day every day exactly we would probably not even more than once per month
[02:22:36] what if you could though because you don't do it for the illegal necessarily most of us we do it
[02:22:41] because hey that could that thing tastes good yeah you know let's face it yeah after dinner
[02:22:45] Ragland I'm assuming you got some steak or something like this it's not like you're like starving
[02:22:49] and hungry after the steak you just want some things yeah that's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[02:22:53] sad so you get that so you get it you get the illegal you got the yours things sweet cool
[02:22:58] but you pay a price yeah now on this new path we don't gotta pay the price look at that
[02:23:04] easier do it every day let's talk about more I have to talk about that one of the
[02:23:11] yes so and you get additional protein in the form of this dessert so boom right there path
[02:23:16] little bit easier you see what I'm saying yeah um good news it also we got some other supporting
[02:23:22] elements uh for your joints during our first super cruel oil that stuff before you immunity
[02:23:27] well you know what you're saying right now is actually a pretty big deal like if you think about
[02:23:32] if you think about the the fact that someone right now is like well they're drinking
[02:23:37] three energy drinks a day yeah and it's not good for them and it is gonna have long term
[02:23:44] negative health effects legitimate well they're doing it for a reason right they need the benefit
[02:23:49] of the energy drink whatever that is but it's like that's not it's a problem it's a problem
[02:23:53] and and all of a sudden like that like with a snap of the fingers you're you can actually
[02:23:58] you can actually still get the benefits with no downside that's freaking crazy no problem yeah
[02:24:07] yeah same thing with dessert all the benefits sweetness goodness filling
[02:24:14] let's face it there's a certain texture too like that you kind of you know you want that mole
[02:24:19] clear that's true but it's all true so you know does that go against the whole hayman
[02:24:29] the path is hard embrace the hardness you look okay but the his his the dichotomy you
[02:24:34] turn me on to this he can't have some big deal this is a big deal too look I think I thought
[02:24:39] be a to the dell heart and some in for for today but apparently I got a job of coming
[02:24:43] in I would the facts the truth I'm doing the best they can talk of here to benefit the group um you
[02:24:49] look the goal isn't to drink milk that's not the goal it's a means to an end
[02:24:56] I'm learning to check so the milk is the protein to help us recover from our workouts
[02:25:02] all right same same yeah right so it's more efficient why should we fight that battle
[02:25:09] we don't have to the same thing cool take them all no matter no fact yeah easy money boom
[02:25:15] more efficient when without a fight when we're not choking down some crap yes some
[02:25:20] chalky how much do you think forward to milk very much so I look I'm I get super
[02:25:26] amped oh yeah and it's the kind and this is good not to hide a malk before we train
[02:25:32] normally I don't do that but I don't know before we train today because I got done with the
[02:25:36] EF online like what 12 30 and we weren't gonna train until 230 times like
[02:25:43] because normally I don't eat until after the train but today
[02:25:48] again it was calling you you know how certain desserts call your name that's what's happening
[02:25:53] too yeah yeah I understand I just don't fully be guess what no problem
[02:25:56] calling this path that we're on just got a little bit easier so you don't kind of worry about that anymore
[02:26:00] check so yeah like I said we had got E-Munity stuff as well cold war uh vitamin D3 boom
[02:26:06] take that all guarantee your path would be a little bit easier versus if you don't take
[02:26:10] that we're not getting sick all of a sudden thank you which we like you can get this you
[02:26:14] get the drinks at wall wall by the way on the east coast if you're on the east coast you're
[02:26:18] gonna wall walk get yourself you can clear out shelves whatever that's kind of like what we're doing
[02:26:23] sanction really sanctioned authorized yeah authorized cori my boy cori my cousin cori rolled in
[02:26:30] with an actual cooler to a wall wall and just started clearing shelves straight up like what yeah
[02:26:36] where's what we're doing where he's just looking at like this like oh yeah you need a wall
[02:26:41] you need you can get this stuff at vitamin shop vitamin shop has the whole line of uh uh the
[02:26:45] supplement so you can go to vitamin shop or you go to jockelfield.com and get some if you want some
[02:26:53] yep and if you're interested in a little discount little free shipping little not having to worry
[02:27:01] about remembering to make sure you're always stopped get the subscription path just got a little
[02:27:06] leave your easier even if the path just got to leave an easier we're efficient remembering we're
[02:27:11] not worried about it more efficient when how we can focus on something else you know no distraction
[02:27:16] technically it's BH little delheart it would be like oh you got a distraction going on you
[02:27:19] to write down remember to order no it's to eliminate that so that we can focus our efforts exactly
[02:27:23] right hundred percent in a way it's decentralized command too because Pete guys over there they're
[02:27:27] over they're taking over that's their jam now and they're coming for you so you can go move elsewhere
[02:27:34] okay so you can subscribe is what we're saying get free shipping check yeah it's true also
[02:27:40] origin USA dot com is where you can get your american made good durable goods as it were but what
[02:27:46] that means is you can get american made denim jeans a few models there we got delta 68 and the
[02:27:53] factory factory yeah and you say factory like they don't I was at the UDG seal museum in four
[02:28:00] peers for them yeah it's awesome and they had a guy that what's like a statue on
[02:28:08] it's not a statue it's a mannequin is there a word for that mannequin okay there's a mannequin
[02:28:14] but he's dressed up like a like a nom seal straight up just wearing jeans just straight up
[02:28:21] that's what he's in the case you know the glass case right like a like a like a action figure yeah
[02:28:27] big one big life like that yeah yeah you can get so we made those delta 68's because I know
[02:28:35] look I'm probably gonna be living multiple lives you know I'll be back here I was about five
[02:28:39] years ago the war and when I come back it's probably gonna be back in nom again could be
[02:28:45] possibly I don't know I'm gonna wear jeans and I'm gonna wear delta 68 jeans and I just
[02:28:50] want the world to know that and like I said they all are made in America from the even the
[02:28:56] bra materials the dirt to the shirt for the jeans as the case may be also this belts on there
[02:29:02] some cool wallets on there hoodies athletic wear anyway that's a lot of stuff on there you get
[02:29:08] what I'm all made in America or junior essay dot com also good news we have our own store
[02:29:15] been had our own store since day one which is again good news just in case you didn't know
[02:29:20] was it day one day eight okay I think okay maybe I don't know one of the early days we'll say that
[02:29:27] it's called jocco store so you go to jocco store dot com and this is where you can get your shirts,
[02:29:32] hats hoodies, rash guards, this kind of stuff discipline equals freedom represent all around the
[02:29:37] path so boom not only did the path get a little bit easier got a little bit cooler
[02:29:43] swiping in jocco store dot com oh also we have the ace uh subscription situation as well it's
[02:29:49] called the shirt locker this is all the shirts that you may or may not see me sometimes Dave Burke
[02:29:57] now carry wearing where you're like oh I didn't see that shirt on the store and you're like oh
