00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number one-to-wait with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening, I go.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Goodbye.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You do not get to say goodbye.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That is the way it goes in this line of work.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You do not get to say goodbye.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:48.50
One day your friend is there, your brother, your shared experiences and shared pain and shared

9
00:00:48.50 --> 00:01:06.50
thoughts. One day your friend is there to share those things and then they're gone.

10
00:01:06.50 --> 00:01:18.50
Of course we think we are all going to live forever.

11
00:01:18.50 --> 00:01:35.50
And then by the bullet or the bomb or the ocean or the sky they are gone.

12
00:01:35.50 --> 00:01:53.50
The memories are there, but they are not enough.

13
00:01:53.50 --> 00:02:04.50
They are not enough because the story was not complete.

14
00:02:04.50 --> 00:02:08.50
There was more.

15
00:02:08.50 --> 00:02:16.50
There was so much more and now there is not.

16
00:02:16.50 --> 00:02:23.50
And there cannot be.

17
00:02:23.50 --> 00:02:30.50
And I did not say goodbye.

18
00:02:30.50 --> 00:02:35.50
Not once.

19
00:02:35.50 --> 00:02:41.50
I did not get to tell you the things I should have told you.

20
00:02:41.50 --> 00:02:48.50
I did not say the words.

21
00:02:48.50 --> 00:02:53.50
Not even a thank you.

22
00:02:53.50 --> 00:03:10.50
But you knew because as I knew you knew and that is good.

23
00:03:10.50 --> 00:03:18.50
And I am thankful.

24
00:03:18.50 --> 00:03:24.50
But we did not finish the story.

25
00:03:24.50 --> 00:03:35.50
The story was not yet complete.

26
00:03:35.50 --> 00:03:44.50
So now I finish it alone.

27
00:03:44.50 --> 00:03:48.50
I will do my best.

28
00:03:48.50 --> 00:03:58.50
But the story will fall short without you in it.

29
00:03:58.50 --> 00:04:11.50
But I will.

30
00:04:11.50 --> 00:04:18.50
I will do my best.

31
00:04:18.50 --> 00:04:24.50
Thank you.

32
00:04:24.50 --> 00:04:33.50
And goodbye.

33
00:04:33.50 --> 00:04:41.50
And I wrote down those words thinking about a question that I got asked.

34
00:04:41.50 --> 00:04:48.50
The question was as an operator I know you lost many brothers.

35
00:04:48.50 --> 00:04:52.50
I lost my wife to cancer.

36
00:04:52.50 --> 00:05:00.50
My question is how do you deal with the inevitable flashbacks and the toughest moments?

37
00:05:00.50 --> 00:05:17.50
For me it would be the hospital visits, emergency ambulance rides or the moment of passing which I was at her side for.

38
00:05:17.50 --> 00:05:25.50
I struggle a bit as those memories continue to rise to the surface.

39
00:05:25.50 --> 00:05:32.50
Thank you for any advice you can offer.

40
00:05:32.50 --> 00:05:38.50
And my advice was yes.

41
00:05:38.50 --> 00:05:40.50
This does happen.

42
00:05:40.50 --> 00:05:47.50
You will have flashbacks of those tough moments.

43
00:05:47.50 --> 00:05:52.50
And you will lose control sometimes.

44
00:05:52.50 --> 00:06:01.50
And you will break down and that is the way it is and that is the way it will be.

45
00:06:01.50 --> 00:06:09.50
And as you process the loss and you adapt to this new reality,

46
00:06:09.50 --> 00:06:17.50
the breakdowns will become less frequent.

47
00:06:17.50 --> 00:06:24.50
And you will learn somewhat to control them.

48
00:06:24.50 --> 00:06:29.50
But they won't go away completely.

49
00:06:29.50 --> 00:06:33.50
Ever.

50
00:06:33.50 --> 00:06:38.50
And that is okay.

51
00:06:38.50 --> 00:06:46.50
Because they will be a reminder of what you do have.

52
00:06:46.50 --> 00:06:53.50
Life.

53
00:06:53.50 --> 00:06:57.50
So live it.

54
00:06:57.50 --> 00:07:08.50
And that is one of the hardest things for the losses that are suffered in my old profession.

55
00:07:08.50 --> 00:07:11.50
There was never any kind of goodbye.

56
00:07:11.50 --> 00:07:16.50
At least not a spoken one.

57
00:07:16.50 --> 00:07:25.50
Because even though it wasn't spoken underneath it was there, we lived it.

58
00:07:25.50 --> 00:07:32.50
We said goodbye every day and how we lived and how we trusted.

59
00:07:32.50 --> 00:07:39.50
And how we gave.

60
00:07:39.50 --> 00:07:45.50
And we were all together.

61
00:07:45.50 --> 00:07:53.50
So to all of you out there that have lost one of your comrades and arms,

62
00:07:53.50 --> 00:07:59.50
even though you might not have gotten to say goodbye,

63
00:07:59.50 --> 00:08:07.50
even though you may not have told them what they meant to you.

64
00:08:07.50 --> 00:08:12.50
Don't worry.

65
00:08:12.50 --> 00:08:17.50
They knew.

66
00:08:17.50 --> 00:08:20.50
They knew.

67
00:08:20.50 --> 00:08:24.50
But you know.

68
00:08:24.50 --> 00:08:33.50
But it's going to be okay.

69
00:08:33.50 --> 00:08:39.50
So like I said, that was a question I got.

70
00:08:39.50 --> 00:08:51.50
And just wanted to offer some perspective that I unfortunately do have.

71
00:08:51.50 --> 00:08:56.50
But speaking of questions echo, it's Q&A day.

72
00:08:56.50 --> 00:08:57.50
Sure.

73
00:08:57.50 --> 00:08:59.50
And I know we got some a few questions.

74
00:08:59.50 --> 00:09:01.50
A few more questions here to go through.

75
00:09:01.50 --> 00:09:04.50
Yeah.

76
00:09:04.50 --> 00:09:06.50
Let's hit it.

77
00:09:06.50 --> 00:09:07.50
All right.

78
00:09:07.50 --> 00:09:08.50
We'll do.

79
00:09:08.50 --> 00:09:09.50
All right.

80
00:09:09.50 --> 00:09:10.50
First question.

81
00:09:10.50 --> 00:09:12.50
I'm a young officer.

82
00:09:12.50 --> 00:09:13.50
Platoon commander.

83
00:09:13.50 --> 00:09:14.50
I deployed late.

84
00:09:14.50 --> 00:09:17.50
But the time I arrived on deployment, there had been some problems.

85
00:09:17.50 --> 00:09:21.50
And my company commander had been sent back to the states.

86
00:09:21.50 --> 00:09:26.50
And the company first sergeant had been redeployed to another country.

87
00:09:26.50 --> 00:09:30.50
Now there's a new company commander and new first sergeant.

88
00:09:30.50 --> 00:09:35.50
They're treating all the soldiers in my platoon and in the entire company as if we are all messed up.

89
00:09:35.50 --> 00:09:36.50
I don't like their attitude.

90
00:09:36.50 --> 00:09:43.50
And my gut tells me they're out to make themselves look good by crucifying more people in the platoons.

91
00:09:43.50 --> 00:09:44.50
I want to take care of my soldiers.

92
00:09:44.50 --> 00:09:49.50
How do I best stand up to the new leadership?

93
00:09:49.50 --> 00:09:50.50
All right.

94
00:09:50.50 --> 00:09:59.50
So I would say the best way that you can take care of your soldiers is not to stand up to the new leadership.

95
00:09:59.50 --> 00:10:03.50
But instead to build a relationship with the new leadership.

96
00:10:03.50 --> 00:10:08.50
You know, if you confront them, you confront the new leadership that's taken over.

97
00:10:08.50 --> 00:10:12.50
Automatically they're going to see you as the enemy, right?

98
00:10:12.50 --> 00:10:16.50
They're going to see whoever got sent home for whatever reason.

99
00:10:16.50 --> 00:10:18.50
Maybe there was some kind of a problem.

100
00:10:18.50 --> 00:10:20.50
Maybe there was, yeah, there's definitely some kind of a problem.

101
00:10:20.50 --> 00:10:21.50
Someone got in trouble.

102
00:10:21.50 --> 00:10:22.50
Something happened to bad.

103
00:10:22.50 --> 00:10:25.50
That's why guys are getting sent out of country or back to the states.

104
00:10:25.50 --> 00:10:29.50
If you confront the new leadership, that means you're on the bad guy's side.

105
00:10:29.50 --> 00:10:31.50
That's not where you want to be.

106
00:10:31.50 --> 00:10:37.50
Because if you're on the bad side, if you're on the bad list, then they're not going to listen to you.

107
00:10:37.50 --> 00:10:39.50
They're not going to trust you.

108
00:10:39.50 --> 00:10:43.50
And they're going to be suspect of you and of your soldiers.

109
00:10:43.50 --> 00:10:48.50
So, so that is not confrontation in this is not going to be helpful.

110
00:10:48.50 --> 00:10:52.50
What you want to do is, if you can build a relationship with them,

111
00:10:52.50 --> 00:10:54.50
if you can try and understand their perspective,

112
00:10:54.50 --> 00:10:56.50
which is important.

113
00:10:56.50 --> 00:11:02.50
Because they don't know, you get, you get put into a position where you're taking over for a quote unquote bad boss,

114
00:11:02.50 --> 00:11:05.50
or a bad poutine or a bad company.

115
00:11:05.50 --> 00:11:07.50
You don't know what the specific problems are.

116
00:11:07.50 --> 00:11:09.50
So, you're pretty suspect on everything.

117
00:11:09.50 --> 00:11:10.50
And you kind of have to be.

118
00:11:10.50 --> 00:11:11.50
So, that's their perspective.

119
00:11:11.50 --> 00:11:13.50
They're perspective is like, yeah, we don't know what's going on in here.

120
00:11:13.50 --> 00:11:15.50
Well, we know it's something bad happened.

121
00:11:15.50 --> 00:11:17.50
They fired the last company commander.

122
00:11:17.50 --> 00:11:19.50
They fired the last company first sergeant.

123
00:11:19.50 --> 00:11:20.50
Something bad happened here.

124
00:11:20.50 --> 00:11:22.50
I don't know what it is, but I'm not going to let it happen to me.

125
00:11:22.50 --> 00:11:24.50
So, I'm suspecting everything.

126
00:11:24.50 --> 00:11:26.50
So, so to understand that perspective.

127
00:11:26.50 --> 00:11:28.50
And then listen what they're saying.

128
00:11:28.50 --> 00:11:30.50
Try and give them some kind of support.

129
00:11:30.50 --> 00:11:31.50
Right?

130
00:11:31.50 --> 00:11:33.50
Try and gain their trust.

131
00:11:33.50 --> 00:11:36.50
So, that way they will listen to you.

132
00:11:36.50 --> 00:11:39.50
And they will start to believe you.

133
00:11:39.50 --> 00:11:43.50
And then you will be in a position where you can actually protect the soldiers.

134
00:11:43.50 --> 00:11:44.50
Right?

135
00:11:44.50 --> 00:11:47.50
If you get fired, you're not protecting your soldiers.

136
00:11:47.50 --> 00:11:49.50
If you go, oh, I'm going to stand up for you guys.

137
00:11:49.50 --> 00:11:50.50
Don't worry about it.

138
00:11:50.50 --> 00:11:52.50
You go and hey, you guys, you treat my soldiers bad.

139
00:11:52.50 --> 00:11:54.50
Oh, really? You're fired.

140
00:11:54.50 --> 00:11:56.50
Now, we're taking care of your soldiers.

141
00:11:56.50 --> 00:11:59.50
So, be careful with that now.

142
00:11:59.50 --> 00:12:01.50
You could be also be right.

143
00:12:01.50 --> 00:12:03.50
And these guys could be really, really bad.

144
00:12:03.50 --> 00:12:05.50
They could be out for themselves.

145
00:12:05.50 --> 00:12:06.50
I'll to make themselves look good.

146
00:12:06.50 --> 00:12:08.50
And if that is the case.

147
00:12:08.50 --> 00:12:12.50
Well, it still remains that the best possible thing you can do for your soldiers

148
00:12:12.50 --> 00:12:15.50
is to develop a relationship with these guys.

149
00:12:15.50 --> 00:12:18.50
And make sure that as they're trying to make themselves look good,

150
00:12:18.50 --> 00:12:22.50
you protect your soldiers as much as you can.

151
00:12:22.50 --> 00:12:24.50
And if they end up being good guys, right?

152
00:12:24.50 --> 00:12:27.50
That we're just like I said, just had a coming into a bad situation.

153
00:12:27.50 --> 00:12:28.50
Well, then you've got an opportunity, then you've

154
00:12:28.50 --> 00:12:30.50
former relationship with them.

155
00:12:30.50 --> 00:12:33.50
And as you get through that, then you, on their good side,

156
00:12:33.50 --> 00:12:36.50
you're good to go that way as well.

157
00:12:36.50 --> 00:12:40.50
Now, this is where people get a little freaked out, right?

158
00:12:40.50 --> 00:12:43.50
Because because I'm sitting here and I'm saying you got to play the game,

159
00:12:43.50 --> 00:12:44.50
right?

160
00:12:44.50 --> 00:12:47.50
People think I'm saying, hey, like you need to brown those.

161
00:12:47.50 --> 00:12:49.50
Yeah, yeah, be fake.

162
00:12:49.50 --> 00:12:50.50
Be fake.

163
00:12:50.50 --> 00:12:51.50
Hey, here's the deal.

164
00:12:51.50 --> 00:12:52.50
I'm not talking about that.

165
00:12:52.50 --> 00:12:53.50
I'm not talking about brown nosing.

166
00:12:53.50 --> 00:12:56.50
I'm talking about being professional.

167
00:12:56.50 --> 00:13:00.50
I'm talking about being respectful.

168
00:13:00.50 --> 00:13:02.50
I'm talking about being humble.

169
00:13:02.50 --> 00:13:03.50
That's what I'm talking about.

170
00:13:03.50 --> 00:13:07.50
I'm talking about understanding their perspective.

171
00:13:07.50 --> 00:13:09.50
I'm not talking about brown nosing.

172
00:13:09.50 --> 00:13:11.50
I'm talking about those things.

173
00:13:11.50 --> 00:13:13.50
That's not how you build relationships.

174
00:13:13.50 --> 00:13:16.50
And by the way, you don't build relationships through brown nosing either.

175
00:13:16.50 --> 00:13:20.50
If you just try and brown those people, they don't respect you.

176
00:13:20.50 --> 00:13:22.50
That does, that's not how you build relationships.

177
00:13:22.50 --> 00:13:24.50
You don't build relationships through brown nosing.

178
00:13:24.50 --> 00:13:26.50
All you do is submit.

179
00:13:26.50 --> 00:13:28.50
You don't build anything.

180
00:13:28.50 --> 00:13:30.50
You're just, you're just on the receive side.

181
00:13:30.50 --> 00:13:34.50
But if you're respectful and you're humble and you're professional,

182
00:13:34.50 --> 00:13:36.50
that's how you build relationships.

183
00:13:36.50 --> 00:13:39.50
And the better relationships you have up the chain of command,

184
00:13:39.50 --> 00:13:42.50
the better you can take care of the people below you and the chain of command.

185
00:13:42.50 --> 00:13:43.50
That's the way it works.

186
00:13:43.50 --> 00:13:47.50
Of course, this doesn't mean you're okay if your superiors are doing something.

187
00:13:47.50 --> 00:13:58.50
That's illegal, immoral, or unethical, or, or if they're putting your troops or the mission in danger.

188
00:13:58.50 --> 00:13:59.50
Right?

189
00:13:59.50 --> 00:14:01.50
We're not playing the game.

190
00:14:01.50 --> 00:14:02.50
We're not playing the game.

191
00:14:02.50 --> 00:14:05.50
Now, you might still even then have to play the game.

192
00:14:05.50 --> 00:14:09.50
If you were my boss echo and you were like, hey, I want you to send your guys to run.

193
00:14:09.50 --> 00:14:12.50
Attack that bunker on the elevated position right there.

194
00:14:12.50 --> 00:14:15.50
Enemy bunker with a machine, multiple machine guns in it.

195
00:14:15.50 --> 00:14:17.50
With inner locking fields of fire.

196
00:14:17.50 --> 00:14:21.50
And I'm like, we're not doing that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

197
00:14:21.50 --> 00:14:24.50
Now, if I tell you, I will not do it.

198
00:14:24.50 --> 00:14:26.50
And you say, okay, fine, you're fired.

199
00:14:26.50 --> 00:14:27.50
You come here.

200
00:14:27.50 --> 00:14:28.50
You take the platoon and go attacking.

201
00:14:28.50 --> 00:14:30.50
Now that guy does, they all get killed.

202
00:14:30.50 --> 00:14:33.50
Maybe what I should've done was like, hey, echo, we shouldn't do that.

203
00:14:33.50 --> 00:14:34.50
It's not a good plan.

204
00:14:34.50 --> 00:14:36.50
And you go, no, you do it anyways.

205
00:14:36.50 --> 00:14:39.50
I go, hey, that's not a good plan.

206
00:14:39.50 --> 00:14:41.50
And you say, go do it or I'm going to fire you.

207
00:14:41.50 --> 00:14:43.50
Okay, I'll go, I'll go do it.

208
00:14:43.50 --> 00:14:47.50
And now when you do it, you go out and you flank.

209
00:14:47.50 --> 00:14:48.50
You do something different.

210
00:14:48.50 --> 00:14:49.50
You know what I mean?

211
00:14:49.50 --> 00:14:50.50
You make something happen.

212
00:14:50.50 --> 00:14:53.50
You mitigate the damage as much as possible.

213
00:14:53.50 --> 00:14:56.50
So that's a decision you're going to have to make.

214
00:14:56.50 --> 00:15:00.50
That's why being a leader is hard because that's a really hard decision to make right there.

215
00:15:00.50 --> 00:15:03.50
Yeah, that's a tough one.

216
00:15:03.50 --> 00:15:06.50
Yeah, I remember at the master last master.

217
00:15:06.50 --> 00:15:09.50
You're talking about like that very thing.

218
00:15:09.50 --> 00:15:13.50
Like you, you build a relationship with them.

219
00:15:13.50 --> 00:15:15.50
And you know, some people, everyone's in a while.

220
00:15:15.50 --> 00:15:20.50
I'm paraphrasing kind of what you said, where some people will look at it as brown nosy.

221
00:15:20.50 --> 00:15:21.50
Yeah.

222
00:15:21.50 --> 00:15:25.50
And you're like, but it's you build a relationship with them.

223
00:15:25.50 --> 00:15:26.50
Everyone's in a while.

224
00:15:26.50 --> 00:15:30.50
It might brush the brush up against it.

225
00:15:30.50 --> 00:15:31.50
Everyone's in a while.

226
00:15:31.50 --> 00:15:32.50
Then I'll come back or whatever.

227
00:15:32.50 --> 00:15:35.50
But the mission is worth that.

228
00:15:35.50 --> 00:15:41.50
Yeah, if I did a brush up against brown nosy in just for a second to accomplish the mission, whatever, then that's what I'm going to do kind of thing.

229
00:15:41.50 --> 00:15:45.50
And that's what it's like, yeah, that makes, that makes good sense.

230
00:15:45.50 --> 00:15:52.50
And really, so when I thought about that, I was like, really what that is is a lack of perspective or people forgetting about the big picture.

231
00:15:52.50 --> 00:15:54.50
You're not letting what the big overall thing is.

232
00:15:54.50 --> 00:15:55.50
We're here to win.

233
00:15:55.50 --> 00:15:56.50
We're here to win.

234
00:15:56.50 --> 00:15:56.50
Yes.

235
00:15:56.50 --> 00:16:00.50
But if I got to tell this guy, he's got a, you know, that's a great plan sir.

236
00:16:00.50 --> 00:16:01.50
Yeah.

237
00:16:01.50 --> 00:16:02.50
You've, you come up with some brilliant plans.

238
00:16:02.50 --> 00:16:05.50
Or I'm going to go and execute that thing. So then he says, oh, see, Jockel gets it.

239
00:16:05.50 --> 00:16:06.50
And I'm going to go let him execute on his own.

240
00:16:06.50 --> 00:16:08.50
I'm not going to bother him because he understands my planning.

241
00:16:08.50 --> 00:16:11.50
And then I go back to my guys and I go, hey, here's what we're doing.

242
00:16:11.50 --> 00:16:13.50
A little different from what the boss said, but don't worry.

243
00:16:13.50 --> 00:16:14.50
His intention was there.

244
00:16:14.50 --> 00:16:15.50
I'm not talking about about the boss.

245
00:16:15.50 --> 00:16:17.50
Hey, this is what the boss want to do.

246
00:16:17.50 --> 00:16:19.50
I think this is how we're going to get it done.

247
00:16:19.50 --> 00:16:19.50
Yeah.

248
00:16:19.50 --> 00:16:20.50
Talk about about your boss.

249
00:16:20.50 --> 00:16:23.50
You're just saying we're making some adjustments based on his guidance.

250
00:16:23.50 --> 00:16:24.50
You're actually giving credit.

251
00:16:24.50 --> 00:16:25.50
Yeah.

252
00:16:25.50 --> 00:16:26.50
That's how you get it done.

253
00:16:26.50 --> 00:16:29.50
You're brushing up against brown nosing a little bit.

254
00:16:29.50 --> 00:16:33.50
But again, if you're just a full on brown nose or you're not developing relationships,

255
00:16:33.50 --> 00:16:36.50
you're just, you're just an ask-case or it's not going to go good for you.

256
00:16:36.50 --> 00:16:37.50
Yeah.

257
00:16:37.50 --> 00:16:39.50
You, because, because think about this.

258
00:16:39.50 --> 00:16:41.50
Think about this. Here's why.

259
00:16:41.50 --> 00:16:43.50
And I just thought of this myself.

260
00:16:43.50 --> 00:16:46.50
Here's why a brown nose or isn't developing preparation.

261
00:16:46.50 --> 00:16:47.50
You've been here.

262
00:16:47.50 --> 00:16:53.50
Here's how it's not good to just be a brown nose or does this superior listen to the brown nose or does he respect with their opinion?

263
00:16:53.50 --> 00:16:55.50
No, not really.

264
00:16:55.50 --> 00:16:55.50
Yeah.

265
00:16:55.50 --> 00:16:57.50
He's just looking at him like, oh, yeah.

266
00:16:57.50 --> 00:16:59.50
Oh, yeah. That's old echo. Yep.

267
00:16:59.50 --> 00:16:59.50
Yeah.

268
00:16:59.50 --> 00:17:00.50
Hey, buddy. Yep.

269
00:17:00.50 --> 00:17:01.50
Yeah.

270
00:17:01.50 --> 00:17:01.50
Yep.

271
00:17:01.50 --> 00:17:03.50
You're going to do whatever. So you're nice little, yes, man. Cool.

272
00:17:03.50 --> 00:17:03.50
Yeah.

273
00:17:03.50 --> 00:17:05.50
You give me input. I'm like, oh, thanks.

274
00:17:05.50 --> 00:17:06.50
Echo. That's cool.

275
00:17:06.50 --> 00:17:06.50
Thank you.

276
00:17:06.50 --> 00:17:08.50
Now, hey, the big boys are over here trying to talk.

277
00:17:08.50 --> 00:17:10.50
Can you just excuse yourself?

278
00:17:10.50 --> 00:17:10.50
Yeah.

279
00:17:10.50 --> 00:17:11.50
You don't want to end up like that.

280
00:17:11.50 --> 00:17:13.50
You're kind of the guy who, like,

281
00:17:13.50 --> 00:17:17.50
you know, like the iconic picture of the guy fanning the other guy.

282
00:17:17.50 --> 00:17:17.50
Yeah.

283
00:17:17.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

284
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

285
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

286
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

287
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

288
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

289
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

290
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

291
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

292
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

293
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

294
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

295
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

296
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

297
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:18.50
Yeah.

298
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:24.50
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, man. But he's not given any strategic input on the operations.

299
00:17:24.50 --> 00:17:26.50
Not building the relationships.

300
00:17:26.50 --> 00:17:27.50
So yeah.

301
00:17:27.50 --> 00:17:28.50
Build the relationship, man.

302
00:17:28.50 --> 00:17:31.50
Don't confront build.

303
00:17:31.50 --> 00:17:32.50
Yeah.

304
00:17:32.50 --> 00:17:34.50
That's what distracted by that, right?

305
00:17:34.50 --> 00:17:36.50
The feeling you get when this new guy comes.

306
00:17:36.50 --> 00:17:37.50
He did.

307
00:17:37.50 --> 00:17:39.50
I don't like the way he said that to me.

308
00:17:39.50 --> 00:17:40.50
Even though what he said was really important,

309
00:17:40.50 --> 00:17:41.50
I don't like the way he said it.

310
00:17:41.50 --> 00:17:47.50
You know what's interesting is when a lot of leadership books that we've discussed and a lot of leadership guidance will say if you're a new guy.

311
00:17:47.50 --> 00:17:51.50
You know, we're going to say if you're a new leader coming in, you just don't start barking orders, right? You just don't start saying,

312
00:17:51.50 --> 00:17:53.50
Hey, do this. We're changing that.

313
00:17:53.50 --> 00:17:56.50
You assess and you look around and you make sure now occasionally this doesn't happen.

314
00:17:56.50 --> 00:18:01.50
There's things that happen if you're taking over a totally messed up unit or team.

315
00:18:01.50 --> 00:18:03.50
Then you might have to go in there and lay down some law.

316
00:18:03.50 --> 00:18:09.50
But generally, you come in and you assess and you make you then you see what's wrong.

317
00:18:09.50 --> 00:18:10.50
You see where some adjustments can be made.

318
00:18:10.50 --> 00:18:13.50
Now think about that from the other side from down the chain of command.

319
00:18:13.50 --> 00:18:16.50
You also shouldn't jump to conclusions and be like,

320
00:18:16.50 --> 00:18:19.50
Oh, the new boss is an idiot or new boss has this plan.

321
00:18:19.50 --> 00:18:21.50
No, you should be like, okay, let's see what his plan is.

322
00:18:21.50 --> 00:18:28.50
Yeah. You should both have a little period of like a like a cooling down period.

323
00:18:28.50 --> 00:18:29.50
Sure.

324
00:18:29.50 --> 00:18:31.50
But a warming up period.

325
00:18:31.50 --> 00:18:32.50
Sure.

326
00:18:32.50 --> 00:18:33.50
The opposite of cooling down.

327
00:18:33.50 --> 00:18:34.50
It's a warming up.

328
00:18:34.50 --> 00:18:35.50
It's getting to know each other.

329
00:18:35.50 --> 00:18:36.50
Yeah.

330
00:18:36.50 --> 00:18:37.50
It's funny.

331
00:18:37.50 --> 00:18:40.50
This is way less feel, but it's a big shocker.

332
00:18:40.50 --> 00:18:42.50
It's a great.

333
00:18:42.50 --> 00:18:44.50
Back in time.

334
00:18:44.50 --> 00:18:50.50
He made this one comment where he was explaining like how he rolled with like some of some payments for him.

335
00:18:50.50 --> 00:18:53.50
And like he rolled out.

336
00:18:53.50 --> 00:18:56.50
I was like, oh yeah, like how was that, you know, you want the full report?

337
00:18:56.50 --> 00:18:57.50
Like how was it really?

338
00:18:57.50 --> 00:19:01.50
I forget it was what he was like, he's like now I was a full on, you know, first date roll.

339
00:19:01.50 --> 00:19:02.50
Oh yeah.

340
00:19:02.50 --> 00:19:03.50
But I never heard that before.

341
00:19:03.50 --> 00:19:05.50
I knew exactly what that meant.

342
00:19:05.50 --> 00:19:08.50
It was like, I'm not going to go hard in the middle right off the bat.

343
00:19:08.50 --> 00:19:10.50
He can feel he's not going hard.

344
00:19:10.50 --> 00:19:14.50
And it's just kind of feeling out, you know, a lot of respect throughout the whole day.

345
00:19:14.50 --> 00:19:16.50
The level does that start out in GJ2.

346
00:19:16.50 --> 00:19:17.50
What do you mean?

347
00:19:17.50 --> 00:19:18.50
Like what?

348
00:19:18.50 --> 00:19:19.50
What?

349
00:19:19.50 --> 00:19:24.50
How good do you have to be in GJ2 before you start like having a little nice gentle.

350
00:19:24.50 --> 00:19:27.50
For you know, I, you know what I call is just respectful.

351
00:19:27.50 --> 00:19:28.50
Yeah.

352
00:19:28.50 --> 00:19:29.50
Like here's an example.

353
00:19:29.50 --> 00:19:32.50
You just don't dive on the ankle rock.

354
00:19:32.50 --> 00:19:33.50
Yeah.

355
00:19:33.50 --> 00:19:35.50
You know, two seconds into.

356
00:19:35.50 --> 00:19:36.50
Yeah.

357
00:19:36.50 --> 00:19:37.50
Like, oh really?

358
00:19:37.50 --> 00:19:38.50
I mean, I've had that happen.

359
00:19:38.50 --> 00:19:41.50
And then I've had to, you know, take appropriate call.

360
00:19:41.50 --> 00:19:42.50
Measures.

361
00:19:42.50 --> 00:19:43.50
Right.

362
00:19:43.50 --> 00:19:44.50
And you see it.

363
00:19:44.50 --> 00:19:45.50
And you know that fit.

364
00:19:45.50 --> 00:19:47.50
And that's the whole reason for the first date roll really.

365
00:19:47.50 --> 00:19:48.50
Yeah.

366
00:19:48.50 --> 00:19:51.50
Because it's like, you know, you start to roll like I, you've heard of them.

367
00:19:51.50 --> 00:19:54.50
And you sort of you and or whatever whatever the situation is.

368
00:19:54.50 --> 00:19:55.50
And you guys roll.

369
00:19:55.50 --> 00:19:59.50
And in your mind, you're kind of like, I'm going to give this guy some respect.

370
00:19:59.50 --> 00:20:00.50
And he doesn't.

371
00:20:00.50 --> 00:20:01.50
He goes all out first thing.

372
00:20:01.50 --> 00:20:03.50
It's kind of like, you kind of got, you got offended a little bit.

373
00:20:03.50 --> 00:20:04.50
Not majorly.

374
00:20:04.50 --> 00:20:06.50
But there's that little inkling of, oh, all right.

375
00:20:06.50 --> 00:20:07.50
It's something.

376
00:20:07.50 --> 00:20:08.50
It's not nothing.

377
00:20:08.50 --> 00:20:09.50
It's something.

378
00:20:09.50 --> 00:20:10.50
It's something.

379
00:20:10.50 --> 00:20:14.50
But compared to just some dude, you know, let's say we're all training some, do some

380
00:20:14.50 --> 00:20:15.50
new person, whatever in the gym.

381
00:20:15.50 --> 00:20:16.50
You guys are all going hard.

382
00:20:16.50 --> 00:20:17.50
It's all good.

383
00:20:17.50 --> 00:20:17.50
You're going hard.

384
00:20:17.50 --> 00:20:18.50
I know.

385
00:20:18.50 --> 00:20:21.50
Like basically purple belts.

386
00:20:21.50 --> 00:20:23.50
They're coming at me.

387
00:20:23.50 --> 00:20:24.50
Brown belts and black belts.

388
00:20:24.50 --> 00:20:25.50
You know, it's all cool.

389
00:20:25.50 --> 00:20:27.50
You know, it's like mutual respect and we'll roll.

390
00:20:27.50 --> 00:20:29.50
And not saying we, and I'm not saying don't roll hard.

391
00:20:29.50 --> 00:20:32.50
And I'm not saying you don't escalate because as you get to go in, you know,

392
00:20:32.50 --> 00:20:33.50
like things escalated.

393
00:20:33.50 --> 00:20:35.50
And that's, you know, you get to know each other now.

394
00:20:35.50 --> 00:20:37.50
To get after it a little bit.

395
00:20:37.50 --> 00:20:38.50
Yeah.

396
00:20:38.50 --> 00:20:39.50
That's weird.

397
00:20:39.50 --> 00:20:40.50
A little unwritten thing.

398
00:20:40.50 --> 00:20:41.50
Yeah.

399
00:20:41.50 --> 00:20:44.50
Ingejitsu isn't it like, I don't really, I guess it's just respect.

400
00:20:44.50 --> 00:20:45.50
Yeah.

401
00:20:45.50 --> 00:20:46.50
I think you respect.

402
00:20:46.50 --> 00:20:48.50
So yeah, do that up and down the chain of command too.

403
00:20:48.50 --> 00:20:49.50
Yeah.

404
00:20:49.50 --> 00:20:50.50
Like respect.

405
00:20:50.50 --> 00:20:51.50
It's that firm.

406
00:20:51.50 --> 00:20:52.50
Like, like, peer.

407
00:20:52.50 --> 00:20:53.50
Like you said that peer.

408
00:20:53.50 --> 00:20:54.50
Let's get to know it's a little warming up period.

409
00:20:54.50 --> 00:20:55.50
We're in a warming up period.

410
00:20:55.50 --> 00:20:56.50
Exactly.

411
00:20:56.50 --> 00:20:58.50
Just give your bosses that slack.

412
00:20:58.50 --> 00:20:59.50
Yeah.

413
00:20:59.50 --> 00:21:00.50
Yeah.

414
00:21:00.50 --> 00:21:01.50
I'll respect.

415
00:21:01.50 --> 00:21:02.50
Oh, nice.

416
00:21:02.50 --> 00:21:03.50
You know.

417
00:21:03.50 --> 00:21:04.50
Next question.

418
00:21:04.50 --> 00:21:05.50
The quote.

419
00:21:05.50 --> 00:21:08.50
If there is a doubt, there's no doubt.

420
00:21:08.50 --> 00:21:09.50
All right.

421
00:21:09.50 --> 00:21:10.50
Remember that?

422
00:21:10.50 --> 00:21:10.50
Yeah.

423
00:21:10.50 --> 00:21:11.50
From, yeah.

424
00:21:11.50 --> 00:21:11.50
Last time.

425
00:21:11.50 --> 00:21:12.50
Okay.

426
00:21:12.50 --> 00:21:14.50
This would seem to indicate avoiding taking risks.

427
00:21:14.50 --> 00:21:18.50
Many, many businesses or many business decisions involve risk.

428
00:21:18.50 --> 00:21:22.50
Often, there can be a doubt about either of two options.

429
00:21:22.50 --> 00:21:27.50
Doubt that you should maintain the status quo and doubt about pursuing a new opportunity.

430
00:21:27.50 --> 00:21:31.50
To frequent or you frequently talk about dichotomies.

431
00:21:31.50 --> 00:21:33.50
Would you mind sharing your thoughts on this principle?

432
00:21:33.50 --> 00:21:34.50
Yeah.

433
00:21:34.50 --> 00:21:37.50
This is a classic thing.

434
00:21:37.50 --> 00:21:39.50
And it's a great point.

435
00:21:39.50 --> 00:21:41.50
And that's why these little soundbites can be a little bit dangerous sometimes.

436
00:21:41.50 --> 00:21:42.50
Yeah.

437
00:21:42.50 --> 00:21:44.50
These are a little power soundbites.

438
00:21:44.50 --> 00:21:45.50
Because they are that simple.

439
00:21:45.50 --> 00:21:47.50
And of course, I like things to be simple.

440
00:21:47.50 --> 00:21:48.50
Right?

441
00:21:48.50 --> 00:21:49.50
That's the number two law of combat.

442
00:21:49.50 --> 00:21:50.50
It's to keep things simple.

443
00:21:50.50 --> 00:21:51.50
Sure.

444
00:21:51.50 --> 00:21:54.50
But sometimes things like this need a little bit of amplifying information.

445
00:21:54.50 --> 00:22:00.50
And yes, this could be construed as being extremely risk-averse.

446
00:22:00.50 --> 00:22:04.50
Like, hey, if I have any doubt about the safety of success of this mission,

447
00:22:04.50 --> 00:22:05.50
did we're not going to do it?

448
00:22:05.50 --> 00:22:06.50
Yeah.

449
00:22:06.50 --> 00:22:12.50
Which if that was the case, then I would have done a zero missions during my deployments to Iraq.

450
00:22:12.50 --> 00:22:14.50
Same with business.

451
00:22:14.50 --> 00:22:16.50
Never would have started victory.

452
00:22:16.50 --> 00:22:20.50
I'm a man never would have started echelon front because there was risk involved in starting those things.

453
00:22:20.50 --> 00:22:22.50
Never would have done anything.

454
00:22:22.50 --> 00:22:23.50
Really?

455
00:22:23.50 --> 00:22:24.50
Because there's always going to be doubt.

456
00:22:24.50 --> 00:22:26.50
So this is a accurate statement.

457
00:22:26.50 --> 00:22:28.50
And of course, every business has risk.

458
00:22:28.50 --> 00:22:34.50
And so I guess that idea that if there is a doubt there is no doubt is not to be taken.

459
00:22:34.50 --> 00:22:39.50
Literally when it comes to risk, when it comes to risk, don't take it.

460
00:22:39.50 --> 00:22:40.50
Literally.

461
00:22:40.50 --> 00:22:44.50
But what it should be, I think, is like a warning, right?

462
00:22:44.50 --> 00:22:45.50
Like a little warning.

463
00:22:45.50 --> 00:22:47.50
That's in your head.

464
00:22:47.50 --> 00:22:51.50
If there's a doubt, like, okay, we need to think about what's going on here.

465
00:22:51.50 --> 00:22:54.50
We need to understand what is at risk here.

466
00:22:54.50 --> 00:22:58.50
Because, and I just had this conversation with us, you know,

467
00:22:58.50 --> 00:23:00.50
of a company as a matter of fact, I was talking about the dichotomy of leadership.

468
00:23:00.50 --> 00:23:02.50
And I was talking about, you know, giving him examples.

469
00:23:02.50 --> 00:23:06.50
It was like a for instance in, and he was in a technology company.

470
00:23:06.50 --> 00:23:12.50
And I said, you know, if you didn't take risk, you wouldn't, you wouldn't make any progress.

471
00:23:12.50 --> 00:23:15.50
But if you took too much risk, you wouldn't be where you are right now.

472
00:23:15.50 --> 00:23:16.50
Because they're dominating.

473
00:23:16.50 --> 00:23:19.50
So it's like, oh, you're balancing that dichotomy all the time.

474
00:23:19.50 --> 00:23:22.50
So if you were to say, hey, if there's a doubt there is no doubt,

475
00:23:22.50 --> 00:23:24.50
you never would have gotten off the ground.

476
00:23:24.50 --> 00:23:33.50
Now, where I think it becomes a more solid statement is from, like, a moral or an ethical standpoint.

477
00:23:33.50 --> 00:23:38.50
And that is if you think that something is wrong, all that it probably is.

478
00:23:38.50 --> 00:23:40.50
Think you're doing something that you probably shouldn't be doing.

479
00:23:40.50 --> 00:23:43.50
Then there's doubt, and you probably shouldn't be doing it.

480
00:23:43.50 --> 00:23:46.50
I think an easy way to keep yourself in check.

481
00:23:46.50 --> 00:23:49.50
And these days, it's a very real possibility.

482
00:23:49.50 --> 00:23:52.50
It's just if you think that you're being recorded all the times.

483
00:23:52.50 --> 00:23:56.50
Like, if you just think, oh, I'm being recorded, which probably somebody is recording you.

484
00:23:56.50 --> 00:23:59.50
Like, if you decide you think you can get away with something, you're probably not going to get away with it.

485
00:23:59.50 --> 00:24:01.50
Look at all the, just go watch you, too.

486
00:24:01.50 --> 00:24:03.50
You don't caught in the actor, whatever.

487
00:24:03.50 --> 00:24:05.50
People get caught all the time.

488
00:24:05.50 --> 00:24:08.50
So whatever you're doing, think that there could be somebody there with a phone recording you.

489
00:24:08.50 --> 00:24:12.50
And I think that's keeps you morally and ethically in check.

490
00:24:12.50 --> 00:24:18.50
You know, I used to tell my guys that you could be getting watched by CNN or Algesira

491
00:24:18.50 --> 00:24:20.50
or some report, you know, whoever.

492
00:24:20.50 --> 00:24:22.50
You know, you could be getting watched.

493
00:24:22.50 --> 00:24:26.50
And if you're doing something that you shouldn't be doing, you're going to get caught.

494
00:24:26.50 --> 00:24:27.50
So don't do it.

495
00:24:27.50 --> 00:24:29.50
Not to mention these days, we got the aircraft overhead.

496
00:24:29.50 --> 00:24:30.50
They can see everything.

497
00:24:30.50 --> 00:24:32.50
So do the right thing.

498
00:24:32.50 --> 00:24:34.50
That's what you do.

499
00:24:34.50 --> 00:24:36.50
You do the right thing.

500
00:24:36.50 --> 00:24:42.50
If you have any doubt that what you're doing is the right thing, then you should probably shouldn't do it.

501
00:24:42.50 --> 00:24:46.50
A lot of those, a lot of the horrible police actions,

502
00:24:46.50 --> 00:24:50.50
are, you know, recorded by some random person with a phone.

503
00:24:50.50 --> 00:24:56.50
Now, of course, I always need to point out that there's all these good actions that take place every single day.

504
00:24:56.50 --> 00:24:59.50
Millions and millions of police doing the right thing.

505
00:24:59.50 --> 00:25:00.50
Yeah.

506
00:25:00.50 --> 00:25:04.50
No one publishes those, no one uploads those on to YouTube or Facebook.

507
00:25:04.50 --> 00:25:07.50
But the bad acts that are caught, they're caught because someone has a camera.

508
00:25:07.50 --> 00:25:08.50
Yeah.

509
00:25:08.50 --> 00:25:10.50
And so like that's great advice for a cop.

510
00:25:10.50 --> 00:25:12.50
Hey, act like you're being recorded all the time.

511
00:25:12.50 --> 00:25:13.50
Yeah.

512
00:25:13.50 --> 00:25:14.50
Yeah.

513
00:25:14.50 --> 00:25:15.50
Yeah.

514
00:25:15.50 --> 00:25:16.50
Well, it makes it make it make it make it make it make it make it make it.

515
00:25:16.50 --> 00:25:17.50
Because you very well might be.

516
00:25:17.50 --> 00:25:17.50
Yeah.

517
00:25:17.50 --> 00:25:18.50
Yeah.

518
00:25:18.50 --> 00:25:21.50
So do the right thing.

519
00:25:21.50 --> 00:25:22.50
Next question.

520
00:25:22.50 --> 00:25:23.50
Thanks God.

521
00:25:23.50 --> 00:25:25.50
I didn't have cameras when I was a kid.

522
00:25:25.50 --> 00:25:27.50
For all the dumb stuff I did.

523
00:25:27.50 --> 00:25:27.50
Yeah.

524
00:25:27.50 --> 00:25:34.50
I always want to make sure that I'm not sitting here saying, like, everyone out there should do the right thing.

525
00:25:34.50 --> 00:25:35.50
Like me.

526
00:25:35.50 --> 00:25:36.50
Yeah.

527
00:25:36.50 --> 00:25:37.50
I'm not saying that.

528
00:25:37.50 --> 00:25:39.50
If you thought I was saying that, I'm not saying that.

529
00:25:39.50 --> 00:25:42.50
I apologize for even sounding that way.

530
00:25:42.50 --> 00:25:47.50
That was his gum and stupid as the next person and still do dumb stuff.

531
00:25:47.50 --> 00:25:48.50
Try not to.

532
00:25:48.50 --> 00:25:49.50
Yeah.

533
00:25:49.50 --> 00:25:50.50
Oh, good, man.

534
00:25:50.50 --> 00:25:51.50
You don't do dumb stuff right now.

535
00:25:51.50 --> 00:25:57.50
No, it was bad when we had Charlie Plum and Jim Conkelon.

536
00:25:57.50 --> 00:25:58.50
Yeah.

537
00:25:58.50 --> 00:26:01.50
And I'm like, thinking, they're like, hey, this is the way to act right.

538
00:26:01.50 --> 00:26:03.50
And I'm like, don't put me in that category with you guys.

539
00:26:03.50 --> 00:26:05.50
You guys are awesome.

540
00:26:05.50 --> 00:26:06.50
Yeah.

541
00:26:06.50 --> 00:26:07.50
Heroes.

542
00:26:07.50 --> 00:26:08.50
And I'm just over here.

543
00:26:08.50 --> 00:26:09.50
Yeah.

544
00:26:09.50 --> 00:26:10.50
Yeah.

545
00:26:10.50 --> 00:26:11.50
Don't say that about me.

546
00:26:11.50 --> 00:26:14.50
Say, like, hey, talk about character.

547
00:26:14.50 --> 00:26:15.50
You have character.

548
00:26:15.50 --> 00:26:17.50
I'm just over here trying to talk about character.

549
00:26:17.50 --> 00:26:18.50
Yeah.

550
00:26:18.50 --> 00:26:19.50
Yeah.

551
00:26:19.50 --> 00:26:20.50
Yeah.

552
00:26:20.50 --> 00:26:21.50
Check.

553
00:26:21.50 --> 00:26:22.50
Next question.

554
00:26:22.50 --> 00:26:23.50
Should make map.

555
00:26:23.50 --> 00:26:24.50
That's what we're calling make map.

556
00:26:24.50 --> 00:26:24.50
Yeah.

557
00:26:24.50 --> 00:26:25.50
Make map.

558
00:26:25.50 --> 00:26:27.50
That's the Marine Corps martial arts program.

559
00:26:27.50 --> 00:26:30.50
Should make map belts carry over in some way.

560
00:26:30.50 --> 00:26:34.50
Did you just do belts or should everyone start out as a white belt?

561
00:26:34.50 --> 00:26:37.50
No matter what kind of training you've had before.

562
00:26:37.50 --> 00:26:38.50
Yeah.

563
00:26:38.50 --> 00:26:39.50
Uh, yep.

564
00:26:39.50 --> 00:26:40.50
White belt.

565
00:26:40.50 --> 00:26:40.50
White belt.

566
00:26:40.50 --> 00:26:40.50
White belt.

567
00:26:40.50 --> 00:26:40.50
White belt.

568
00:26:40.50 --> 00:26:42.50
Uh, for those of you,

569
00:26:42.50 --> 00:26:44.50
they don't know what make map is.

570
00:26:44.50 --> 00:26:46.50
Make map is the Marine Corps martial arts program.

571
00:26:46.50 --> 00:26:47.50
It's good program.

572
00:26:47.50 --> 00:26:48.50
Solid.

573
00:26:48.50 --> 00:26:49.50
Solid.

574
00:26:49.50 --> 00:26:51.50
Good place to start the Marine Corps put together.

575
00:26:51.50 --> 00:26:52.50
Good program.

576
00:26:52.50 --> 00:26:55.50
The Army has a really good program to the Army combatives program.

577
00:26:55.50 --> 00:26:56.50
Yeah.

578
00:26:56.50 --> 00:26:57.50
Great stuff.

579
00:26:57.50 --> 00:27:01.50
And both of those are solid, but specifically the Marine Corps.

580
00:27:01.50 --> 00:27:04.50
Makes when the Marine Corps martial arts program has belts.

581
00:27:04.50 --> 00:27:06.50
You get like a 10 belt.

582
00:27:06.50 --> 00:27:07.50
And then I think a green belt.

583
00:27:07.50 --> 00:27:08.50
And then a brown belt.

584
00:27:08.50 --> 00:27:09.50
And then a black belt.

585
00:27:09.50 --> 00:27:09.50
Pretty legit.

586
00:27:09.50 --> 00:27:09.50
Right.

587
00:27:09.50 --> 00:27:10.50
They have a little program.

588
00:27:10.50 --> 00:27:12.50
Um,

589
00:27:12.50 --> 00:27:15.50
There is no equivalency to Gitu.

590
00:27:15.50 --> 00:27:20.50
Like you, you'll know some stuff, but it's, you should just when you go to start

591
00:27:20.50 --> 00:27:22.50
Gitu, you just go with the white belt on.

592
00:27:22.50 --> 00:27:24.50
Now it's the same thing with Duda.

593
00:27:24.50 --> 00:27:27.50
Duda is really close to Gitu as we know.

594
00:27:27.50 --> 00:27:29.50
Duda is really close to Gitu.

595
00:27:29.50 --> 00:27:33.50
If you have a black belt in Duda, cool white belt in Ditu.

596
00:27:33.50 --> 00:27:39.50
Uh, Samba, it's very, you know, again, very similar to Gitu, white belt.

597
00:27:39.50 --> 00:27:41.50
So you're going to get promoted faster.

598
00:27:41.50 --> 00:27:42.50
Yeah.

599
00:27:42.50 --> 00:27:44.50
Because you have a lot of experience wrestling is the same thing.

600
00:27:44.50 --> 00:27:47.50
Like you just don't go, oh, I'm just going to show up as a purple box.

601
00:27:47.50 --> 00:27:48.50
I've been grappling for eight years.

602
00:27:48.50 --> 00:27:50.50
No, it doesn't work that way.

603
00:27:50.50 --> 00:27:51.50
Show up with a white belt.

604
00:27:51.50 --> 00:27:52.50
Be humble.

605
00:27:52.50 --> 00:27:53.50
No big deal.

606
00:27:53.50 --> 00:27:54.50
You'll advance fast.

607
00:27:54.50 --> 00:27:55.50
Don't care about the belts, man.

608
00:27:55.50 --> 00:27:57.50
We talk about this all the time.

609
00:27:57.50 --> 00:27:58.50
Doesn't matter.

610
00:27:58.50 --> 00:27:59.50
Yeah.

611
00:27:59.50 --> 00:28:00.50
Just going there and train.

612
00:28:00.50 --> 00:28:02.50
And that effect having a white belt is kind of nice.

613
00:28:02.50 --> 00:28:04.50
Because there's no pressure whatsoever.

614
00:28:04.50 --> 00:28:06.50
Like just enjoy that.

615
00:28:06.50 --> 00:28:08.50
Enjoy not worrying about getting tapped out.

616
00:28:08.50 --> 00:28:12.50
Enjoy just being able to roll and roll with people that are better than you are worse.

617
00:28:12.50 --> 00:28:14.50
You're the lowest on the bottom of the totem pole.

618
00:28:14.50 --> 00:28:15.50
Yeah.

619
00:28:15.50 --> 00:28:16.50
You can roll with anybody in tap out.

620
00:28:16.50 --> 00:28:17.50
And that's it.

621
00:28:17.50 --> 00:28:18.50
It's cool.

622
00:28:18.50 --> 00:28:18.50
Yeah.

623
00:28:18.50 --> 00:28:19.50
Don't worry about it.

624
00:28:19.50 --> 00:28:20.50
Yeah.

625
00:28:20.50 --> 00:28:21.50
Agreed.

626
00:28:21.50 --> 00:28:21.50
Yeah.

627
00:28:21.50 --> 00:28:24.50
I mean, that it seems kind of self-explanatory.

628
00:28:24.50 --> 00:28:28.50
Maybe a little bit because, you know, it's like anything.

629
00:28:28.50 --> 00:28:30.50
It's like any acolyte.

630
00:28:30.50 --> 00:28:32.50
Because it's really what the belt is essentially.

631
00:28:32.50 --> 00:28:33.50
It's like an acolyte, right?

632
00:28:33.50 --> 00:28:34.50
That you can wear.

633
00:28:34.50 --> 00:28:40.50
I think the belt actually is a sign of where you are on the on the hierarchy.

634
00:28:40.50 --> 00:28:41.50
Yeah.

635
00:28:41.50 --> 00:28:42.50
Right.

636
00:28:42.50 --> 00:28:43.50
And it's a sign though.

637
00:28:43.50 --> 00:28:44.50
Yeah.

638
00:28:44.50 --> 00:28:45.50
It's not written in stone.

639
00:28:45.50 --> 00:28:47.50
It's just a sign because we know that there's.

640
00:28:47.50 --> 00:28:48.50
There's indicate.

641
00:28:48.50 --> 00:28:48.50
Yeah.

642
00:28:48.50 --> 00:28:49.50
It's an indicate.

643
00:28:49.50 --> 00:28:49.50
Right.

644
00:28:49.50 --> 00:28:50.50
Because we know that there's there's.

645
00:28:50.50 --> 00:28:51.50
There's.

646
00:28:51.50 --> 00:28:51.50
Yeah.

647
00:28:51.50 --> 00:28:51.50
There's.

648
00:28:51.50 --> 00:28:52.50
Yeah.

649
00:28:51.50 --> 00:28:52.50
There's.

650
00:28:52.50 --> 00:28:53.50
Yeah.

651
00:28:53.50 --> 00:28:54.50
Yeah.

652
00:28:54.50 --> 00:28:55.50
It's just an indicator.

653
00:28:55.50 --> 00:28:58.50
But what about like the purpose though, you know.

654
00:28:58.50 --> 00:29:01.50
It's like a. It's like a little thing like a badge.

655
00:29:01.50 --> 00:29:01.50
Okay.

656
00:29:01.50 --> 00:29:02.50
Yeah.

657
00:29:02.50 --> 00:29:02.50
Yeah.

658
00:29:02.50 --> 00:29:04.50
I'm trying to figure if I can count to that.

659
00:29:04.50 --> 00:29:05.50
But I don't think it's like a badge.

660
00:29:05.50 --> 00:29:05.50
Yeah.

661
00:29:05.50 --> 00:29:06.50
Yeah.

662
00:29:06.50 --> 00:29:06.50
Yeah.

663
00:29:06.50 --> 00:29:07.50
I'm trying to figure it out for sure.

664
00:29:07.50 --> 00:29:08.50
Like what it is.

665
00:29:08.50 --> 00:29:09.50
I like belts by the way.

666
00:29:09.50 --> 00:29:10.50
I like it.

667
00:29:10.50 --> 00:29:11.50
I dig the whole thing.

668
00:29:11.50 --> 00:29:12.50
But yeah.

669
00:29:12.50 --> 00:29:15.50
If you get kind of that badge in something specific.

670
00:29:15.50 --> 00:29:17.50
It's all something specific.

671
00:29:17.50 --> 00:29:18.50
Like even like real badges.

672
00:29:18.50 --> 00:29:19.50
You know, it's specific.

673
00:29:19.50 --> 00:29:20.50
Yeah.

674
00:29:20.50 --> 00:29:21.50
So yeah.

675
00:29:21.50 --> 00:29:22.50
When you come and do something else.

676
00:29:22.50 --> 00:29:23.50
It's like, yeah.

677
00:29:23.50 --> 00:29:24.50
You got to get that specific badge.

678
00:29:24.50 --> 00:29:25.50
Yeah.

679
00:29:25.50 --> 00:29:25.50
True.

680
00:29:25.50 --> 00:29:26.50
In, you know.

681
00:29:26.50 --> 00:29:28.50
It's two to your 540.

682
00:29:28.50 --> 00:29:29.50
Right.

683
00:29:29.50 --> 00:29:29.50
Right.

684
00:29:29.50 --> 00:29:29.50
Right.

685
00:29:29.50 --> 00:29:29.50
Right.

686
00:29:29.50 --> 00:29:30.50
Right.

687
00:29:30.50 --> 00:29:31.50
They have judo and you did.

688
00:29:31.50 --> 00:29:32.50
They've judo in there.

689
00:29:32.50 --> 00:29:35.50
So, you know, if you're thinking that you did to class, you know,

690
00:29:35.50 --> 00:29:38.50
at noon and then you go to the judo class at two.

691
00:29:38.50 --> 00:29:38.50
Yeah.

692
00:29:38.50 --> 00:29:39.50
You're changing your belts.

693
00:29:39.50 --> 00:29:39.50
Yeah.

694
00:29:39.50 --> 00:29:40.50
If you're different.

695
00:29:40.50 --> 00:29:42.50
You know, you can't just, oh, I'm just going to keep on my gear.

696
00:29:42.50 --> 00:29:43.50
And just teach me judo.

697
00:29:43.50 --> 00:29:45.50
I'm not an annoying and I'll buy you change your belts.

698
00:29:45.50 --> 00:29:46.50
That's how.

699
00:29:46.50 --> 00:29:47.50
You know, that's the different thing.

700
00:29:47.50 --> 00:29:48.50
And like he said, there's so much.

701
00:29:48.50 --> 00:29:49.50
So you're right.

702
00:29:49.50 --> 00:29:50.50
It's vice versa too.

703
00:29:50.50 --> 00:29:51.50
Get your black belt in.

704
00:29:51.50 --> 00:29:52.50
In judo.

705
00:29:52.50 --> 00:29:57.50
Yeah.

706
00:29:57.50 --> 00:30:00.50
Yeah.

707
00:30:00.50 --> 00:30:02.50
Yeah.

708
00:30:02.50 --> 00:30:04.50
But actually this question he said should it, should it translate.

709
00:30:04.50 --> 00:30:06.50
Carry over in some way.

710
00:30:06.50 --> 00:30:07.50
Yeah.

711
00:30:07.50 --> 00:30:08.50
It does carry over in some way.

712
00:30:08.50 --> 00:30:12.50
Right.

713
00:30:12.50 --> 00:30:13.50
Right.

714
00:30:13.50 --> 00:30:17.50
You have some love.

715
00:30:17.50 --> 00:30:18.50
This skill.

716
00:30:18.50 --> 00:30:19.50
Yeah.

717
00:30:19.50 --> 00:30:20.50
The skill does not the belt though.

718
00:30:20.50 --> 00:30:21.50
Yeah.

719
00:30:21.50 --> 00:30:23.50
You can start a judo black belt.

720
00:30:23.50 --> 00:30:25.50
Most judo black belts.

721
00:30:25.50 --> 00:30:26.50
Yeah.

722
00:30:26.50 --> 00:30:27.50
You're not going to do well.

723
00:30:27.50 --> 00:30:27.50
Yeah.

724
00:30:27.50 --> 00:30:29.50
And that's just, kind of speaks more for.

725
00:30:29.50 --> 00:30:30.50
Because I think you've seen the idea.

726
00:30:30.50 --> 00:30:31.50
Yeah.

727
00:30:31.50 --> 00:30:33.50
Just, just time on time and training.

728
00:30:33.50 --> 00:30:33.50
Yeah.

729
00:30:33.50 --> 00:30:34.50
It's time and training.

730
00:30:34.50 --> 00:30:36.50
If you've been training longer, you're going to win.

731
00:30:36.50 --> 00:30:37.50
Yeah.

732
00:30:37.50 --> 00:30:38.50
That's the general rule.

733
00:30:38.50 --> 00:30:39.50
Yeah.

734
00:30:39.50 --> 00:30:41.50
You know, of course there's athleticism in the strength.

735
00:30:41.50 --> 00:30:42.50
And there's a lot of a lot.

736
00:30:42.50 --> 00:30:43.50
But if you've been training,

737
00:30:43.50 --> 00:30:45.50
you're going to win.

738
00:30:45.50 --> 00:30:46.50
Yeah.

739
00:30:46.50 --> 00:30:47.50
Pretty much.

740
00:30:47.50 --> 00:30:48.50
Yeah.

741
00:30:48.50 --> 00:30:49.50
Makes sense.

742
00:30:49.50 --> 00:30:50.50
Next question.

743
00:30:50.50 --> 00:30:53.50
I run a five-man team.

744
00:30:53.50 --> 00:30:54.50
Two men down.

745
00:30:54.50 --> 00:30:55.50
What does that mean?

746
00:30:55.50 --> 00:30:56.50
These, these missing two guys.

747
00:30:56.50 --> 00:30:58.50
Oh, it's okay.

748
00:30:58.50 --> 00:30:59.50
So five-man team.

749
00:30:59.50 --> 00:31:00.50
So what?

750
00:31:00.50 --> 00:31:01.50
It's supposed to be seven.

751
00:31:01.50 --> 00:31:02.50
Now it's five words.

752
00:31:02.50 --> 00:31:03.50
It's a five-man team.

753
00:31:03.50 --> 00:31:04.50
Now there's only three.

754
00:31:04.50 --> 00:31:05.50
We don't know.

755
00:31:05.50 --> 00:31:05.50
Wouldn't it?

756
00:31:05.50 --> 00:31:06.50
Well, okay.

757
00:31:06.50 --> 00:31:07.50
Either way, we figure that he's underman.

758
00:31:07.50 --> 00:31:08.50
Sure.

759
00:31:08.50 --> 00:31:09.50
We know that much.

760
00:31:09.50 --> 00:31:10.50
Sure.

761
00:31:10.50 --> 00:31:11.50
Sure.

762
00:31:11.50 --> 00:31:11.50
Okay.

763
00:31:11.50 --> 00:31:12.50
Underman team.

764
00:31:12.50 --> 00:31:13.50
Five-man team.

765
00:31:13.50 --> 00:31:14.50
Two-man.

766
00:31:14.50 --> 00:31:15.50
I'm not meeting performance expectations.

767
00:31:15.50 --> 00:31:17.50
No sport coming from my command.

768
00:31:17.50 --> 00:31:21.50
You see a way out other than just getting after it.

769
00:31:21.50 --> 00:31:26.22
I know you also talk about blaming yourself and taking extreme ownership because the people

770
00:31:26.22 --> 00:31:31.50
above you may have different information that leads to prioritized different areas.

771
00:31:31.50 --> 00:31:35.50
However, when I question things like why we don't have enough people working in different

772
00:31:35.50 --> 00:31:38.50
zones when clearly there's an imbalance in zones.

773
00:31:38.50 --> 00:31:43.50
To the point customers notice or it makes it difficult for colleagues to do their jobs.

774
00:31:43.50 --> 00:31:48.50
Then I'm deemed argumentative and that I don't have the best intentions.

775
00:31:48.50 --> 00:31:56.50
This was with a manager that is in charge of business and I would think understands my perspective more.

776
00:31:56.50 --> 00:32:01.50
We're supposed to have a culture of feedback, but he isn't receptive.

777
00:32:01.50 --> 00:32:04.50
I'm not the only one who said that about him as well.

778
00:32:04.50 --> 00:32:06.50
This all leads to me.

779
00:32:06.50 --> 00:32:12.50
This all leads me to think that I must just be fake and go through the motions.

780
00:32:12.50 --> 00:32:14.50
But that disgust me.

781
00:32:14.50 --> 00:32:15.50
Yeah.

782
00:32:15.50 --> 00:32:18.50
So what do we do here?

783
00:32:18.50 --> 00:32:19.50
How do we take ownership of this?

784
00:32:19.50 --> 00:32:25.50
How do you take ownership of your boss not listening to you not hearing what you're saying?

785
00:32:25.50 --> 00:32:30.50
Well, the way you take ownership of that isn't to say my boss doesn't listen and doesn't understand.

786
00:32:30.50 --> 00:32:37.50
The way to take ownership of that is to say that I'm not a I'm not doing a good job of getting my information to my boss.

787
00:32:37.50 --> 00:32:38.50
I'm not doing a good job of convincing my boss.

788
00:32:38.50 --> 00:32:40.50
I'm not doing a good job of influencing my boss.

789
00:32:40.50 --> 00:32:41.50
Boss.

790
00:32:41.50 --> 00:32:45.50
So you can need to be mad about that or you can change your approach.

791
00:32:45.50 --> 00:32:48.50
Step one, we're going back to this again today.

792
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:51.50
Build a relationship with that person.

793
00:32:51.50 --> 00:32:55.50
Now there's a chance that that disgusts you.

794
00:32:55.50 --> 00:32:57.50
There is, right?

795
00:32:57.50 --> 00:32:58.50
I've talked about that before.

796
00:32:58.50 --> 00:33:03.50
I've literally said that I had great relationships with people that I had like a visual hatred for.

797
00:33:03.50 --> 00:33:06.50
I still had a good relationship with them and it worked very well with them.

798
00:33:06.50 --> 00:33:10.50
If it disgust you and you can't do that.

799
00:33:10.50 --> 00:33:12.50
Then there's other jobs, right?

800
00:33:12.50 --> 00:33:14.50
We don't have to interact with other people.

801
00:33:14.50 --> 00:33:16.50
You can be like a long haul truck driver.

802
00:33:16.50 --> 00:33:19.50
You can be a technical writer.

803
00:33:19.50 --> 00:33:23.50
You know, where you just look at the information and turn it into words.

804
00:33:23.50 --> 00:33:24.50
You can be a lab technician.

805
00:33:24.50 --> 00:33:26.50
We don't have to interact with a lot of different people.

806
00:33:26.50 --> 00:33:27.50
And that's cool.

807
00:33:27.50 --> 00:33:31.50
There's a lot of jobs out there that require very little human and action.

808
00:33:31.50 --> 00:33:32.50
That's fine.

809
00:33:32.50 --> 00:33:36.50
Because if you think you're going to go through life only working with people that you get along with

810
00:33:36.50 --> 00:33:37.50
you're wrong.

811
00:33:37.50 --> 00:33:39.50
That's not going to happen.

812
00:33:39.50 --> 00:33:44.50
Especially if you want to run teams and you want to lead and you have to learn how to get over the fact that you might

813
00:33:44.50 --> 00:33:48.50
have to work with people that you don't like.

814
00:33:48.50 --> 00:33:55.50
And by the way, on top of that, if they know that you don't like them, that is not going to make your

815
00:33:55.50 --> 00:33:56.50
job easier.

816
00:33:56.50 --> 00:33:57.50
And it's not going to make your life better.

817
00:33:57.50 --> 00:33:59.50
In fact, it's going to make your life more miserable.

818
00:33:59.50 --> 00:34:05.50
The people that I had visceral hatred for that that I worked for.

819
00:34:05.50 --> 00:34:08.50
It wasn't that bad because at least they thought I liked them.

820
00:34:08.50 --> 00:34:10.50
And I acted like it and they liked me.

821
00:34:10.50 --> 00:34:12.50
So it's like, okay, it's a little painful.

822
00:34:12.50 --> 00:34:13.50
But you know what?

823
00:34:13.50 --> 00:34:19.50
It's pretty low impact as opposed to like head to head conflict every single day.

824
00:34:19.50 --> 00:34:23.50
And by the way, when you have head to head conflict every day, you're miserable, you're going to

825
00:34:23.50 --> 00:34:26.50
advance slower, you're going to have less control over your fate.

826
00:34:26.50 --> 00:34:28.50
You're not going to get promoted.

827
00:34:28.50 --> 00:34:33.50
And on top of that, you're going to get assigned the crappiest possible jobs because your boss doesn't like you.

828
00:34:33.50 --> 00:34:35.50
And he likes that other guy over there.

829
00:34:35.50 --> 00:34:36.50
So he's going to get the easy job.

830
00:34:36.50 --> 00:34:39.50
He's going to get go, you go save the princess.

831
00:34:39.50 --> 00:34:41.50
Jocco goes to lay the dragon, right?

832
00:34:41.50 --> 00:34:44.50
And of course, you know, I prefer to say the dragon.

833
00:34:44.50 --> 00:34:45.50
Never have the princess.

834
00:34:45.50 --> 00:34:47.50
But that's what I'm saying.

835
00:34:47.50 --> 00:34:49.50
Like you want to get along with this person.

836
00:34:49.50 --> 00:34:51.50
You want to play the long game.

837
00:34:51.50 --> 00:34:53.50
You want to play the long game.

838
00:34:53.50 --> 00:34:54.50
And here's the deal.

839
00:34:54.50 --> 00:34:59.50
When you play the long game, if the person sucks as bad as you say they do, they'll end up

840
00:34:59.50 --> 00:35:05.50
making their own bed and having to lie in it and they'll end up working for you.

841
00:35:05.50 --> 00:35:16.50
Now, also make sure that you come to the table with solutions, not just complaints and problems.

842
00:35:16.50 --> 00:35:17.50
Right?

843
00:35:17.50 --> 00:35:21.50
You can see that this guy's talking about, we don't have enough guys and you need to square these

844
00:35:21.50 --> 00:35:22.50
zones.

845
00:35:22.50 --> 00:35:23.50
What's your solution?

846
00:35:23.50 --> 00:35:24.50
The problems.

847
00:35:24.50 --> 00:35:26.50
And what's really smart to do?

848
00:35:26.50 --> 00:35:31.50
And you've got to be a little bit careful with this, but what can be very smart to do is,

849
00:35:31.50 --> 00:35:38.50
if you can solve the problem with your own internal assets, just go and execute on it and solve it.

850
00:35:38.50 --> 00:35:43.50
You know, if you use your own internal assets to solve a problem,

851
00:35:43.50 --> 00:35:47.50
make the change, make it happen in an implement and you go to the Boston say, hey, this is what we did.

852
00:35:47.50 --> 00:35:50.50
There was this problem on our zones or whatever.

853
00:35:50.50 --> 00:35:52.50
Yeah, we made this adjustment.

854
00:35:52.50 --> 00:35:54.50
I took two guys from this blah, blah, blah, blah.

855
00:35:54.50 --> 00:35:56.50
I moved them around and now here's where we're at.

856
00:35:56.50 --> 00:35:58.50
We're getting better results.

857
00:35:58.50 --> 00:36:03.50
You have to be careful because you can say that in such a way that you're thrown in your boss's face, right?

858
00:36:03.50 --> 00:36:05.50
Absolutely do that.

859
00:36:05.50 --> 00:36:11.50
Now, even though you're trying to build a relationship and trying to help the mission, you still end up with an adversarial relationship with your boss.

860
00:36:11.50 --> 00:36:12.50
Now things go negative again.

861
00:36:12.50 --> 00:36:14.50
So you've got to be careful when you do this.

862
00:36:14.50 --> 00:36:18.50
You can also just present the idea and present the solution, be like, hey, boss, here's what I want to do.

863
00:36:18.50 --> 00:36:21.50
Which is, that's once you've got the relationship trust built up.

864
00:36:21.50 --> 00:36:25.50
That doesn't there, then you can't just go present a broad, present a solution of how you're going to do it.

865
00:36:25.50 --> 00:36:29.50
You're going to do it. It's not going to let you do it because you just trust you because you've got an adversarial relationship with you.

866
00:36:29.50 --> 00:36:30.50
You see where this is?

867
00:36:30.50 --> 00:36:31.50
Yeah.

868
00:36:31.50 --> 00:36:32.50
You see how this works?

869
00:36:32.50 --> 00:36:33.50
Yeah.

870
00:36:33.50 --> 00:36:35.50
Another thing he says near.

871
00:36:35.50 --> 00:36:46.50
He says, uh, he says, uh, I would think the manager, this was a manager that has in charge of the business and I would think he understands my perspective more.

872
00:36:46.50 --> 00:36:47.50
Right?

873
00:36:47.50 --> 00:36:48.50
So here we go.

874
00:36:48.50 --> 00:36:53.50
If you want to take ownership of things and how you and you look at your boss and say,

875
00:36:53.50 --> 00:36:57.50
he doesn't blame my perspective or doesn't understand my perspective, that's his fault.

876
00:36:57.50 --> 00:37:01.50
You know the way I look at that, if you don't understand my perspective as my boss, it's my fault.

877
00:37:01.50 --> 00:37:03.50
That means I'm not explaining to you.

878
00:37:03.50 --> 00:37:05.50
It means I'm not giving you enough information.

879
00:37:05.50 --> 00:37:06.50
It means I'm not convinced.

880
00:37:06.50 --> 00:37:08.50
It means I'm not building relationships that you can see my perspective.

881
00:37:08.50 --> 00:37:10.50
That's what that is.

882
00:37:10.50 --> 00:37:15.50
So don't blame the boss.

883
00:37:15.50 --> 00:37:19.50
Step up your game, build a relationship, teach him the perspective and win.

884
00:37:19.50 --> 00:37:26.50
And I'll tell you one more little thing on this from a to get away from the discussed mindset.

885
00:37:26.50 --> 00:37:29.50
Because I understand that.

886
00:37:29.50 --> 00:37:34.50
You know, the one good way to get away from the discussed mindset is to get into the game mindset.

887
00:37:34.50 --> 00:37:36.50
The game, like this is a game.

888
00:37:36.50 --> 00:37:39.50
And this guy that I don't like, I'm going to become best friends with him.

889
00:37:39.50 --> 00:37:40.50
Watch.

890
00:37:40.50 --> 00:37:40.50
Yeah.

891
00:37:40.50 --> 00:37:40.50
Yeah.

892
00:37:40.50 --> 00:37:41.50
You know what I mean?

893
00:37:41.50 --> 00:37:42.50
Like, okay.

894
00:37:42.50 --> 00:37:43.50
Oh, you don't like this guy.

895
00:37:43.50 --> 00:37:44.50
Cool watch.

896
00:37:44.50 --> 00:37:44.50
Yeah.

897
00:37:44.50 --> 00:37:45.50
Watch this.

898
00:37:45.50 --> 00:37:46.50
That's how it's going to go.

899
00:37:46.50 --> 00:37:47.50
And you're going to have fun with it.

900
00:37:47.50 --> 00:37:50.50
And you're going to try and win the game, which is good.

901
00:37:50.50 --> 00:37:51.50
Sure.

902
00:37:51.50 --> 00:38:02.50
That understanding perspective, I think that's everyday, almost everyday kind of thing, where.

903
00:38:02.50 --> 00:38:03.50
Okay.

904
00:38:03.50 --> 00:38:05.50
So my wife.

905
00:38:05.50 --> 00:38:08.50
We're on our way to the park.

906
00:38:08.50 --> 00:38:11.50
This is today, by the way.

907
00:38:11.50 --> 00:38:14.50
And she's like, oh, she said, it's a, the superk's.

908
00:38:14.50 --> 00:38:17.50
There's one you can go straight. This one you'd make a right then you make another left.

909
00:38:17.50 --> 00:38:18.50
It's two parks.

910
00:38:18.50 --> 00:38:20.50
And I don't know which one we're going to.

911
00:38:20.50 --> 00:38:23.50
I don't really mind which one we go to.

912
00:38:23.50 --> 00:38:26.50
So she's like, yeah, let's let's go to the other one.

913
00:38:26.50 --> 00:38:27.50
Right.

914
00:38:27.50 --> 00:38:30.50
And she mentions the, I don't know what you can one is the other one.

915
00:38:30.50 --> 00:38:32.50
But whatever I'll follow your direction.

916
00:38:32.50 --> 00:38:33.50
So she said, okay, make her.

917
00:38:33.50 --> 00:38:35.50
She said, she goes stay in this lane.

918
00:38:35.50 --> 00:38:36.50
She doesn't motion though.

919
00:38:36.50 --> 00:38:37.50
She goes stay in this lane.

920
00:38:37.50 --> 00:38:39.50
So I'm thinking, okay, and we're going to stay in this lane.

921
00:38:39.50 --> 00:38:40.50
She goes, okay.

922
00:38:40.50 --> 00:38:41.50
Turn here.

923
00:38:41.50 --> 00:38:45.50
But then so she's not like pointing like turn here.

924
00:38:45.50 --> 00:38:46.50
It's like because there's a turn right here.

925
00:38:46.50 --> 00:38:48.50
Then there's one like right here.

926
00:38:48.50 --> 00:38:51.50
You know, turn here can apply to like a bunch of stuff.

927
00:38:51.50 --> 00:38:53.50
But in her mind, it's super clear, you know.

928
00:38:53.50 --> 00:38:57.50
So if I would have got mad or actually,

929
00:38:57.50 --> 00:39:00.50
I can see how people can get frustrated right there.

930
00:39:00.50 --> 00:39:00.50
Right.

931
00:39:00.50 --> 00:39:03.50
So if I would express myself, you're not being more clear.

932
00:39:03.50 --> 00:39:04.50
Boom.

933
00:39:04.50 --> 00:39:07.50
Now we're against the relationship because I didn't,

934
00:39:07.50 --> 00:39:09.50
In my mind, I'm like, I can't read your mind.

935
00:39:09.50 --> 00:39:11.50
It's plain better.

936
00:39:11.50 --> 00:39:12.50
I don't want to leave.

937
00:39:12.50 --> 00:39:13.50
It's got a funny story.

938
00:39:13.50 --> 00:39:15.50
He was there on night visions in a home.

939
00:39:15.50 --> 00:39:17.50
He's telling the driver.

940
00:39:17.50 --> 00:39:18.50
He's in the vehicle commander.

941
00:39:18.50 --> 00:39:21.50
See, which is the, basically the pat, the front passenger.

942
00:39:21.50 --> 00:39:23.50
See, and he's, he's pointing.

943
00:39:23.50 --> 00:39:24.50
He's going, hey, turn here.

944
00:39:24.50 --> 00:39:25.50
Here.

945
00:39:25.50 --> 00:39:26.50
Yeah.

946
00:39:26.50 --> 00:39:28.50
And the guy just keeps driving.

947
00:39:28.50 --> 00:39:30.50
And he goes, bro, what are you doing?

948
00:39:30.50 --> 00:39:33.50
And the guy's like, I can't see you because when you have night vision goggles on,

949
00:39:33.50 --> 00:39:34.50
you have no peripheral vision.

950
00:39:34.50 --> 00:39:36.50
He's like, I can't see your fingers.

951
00:39:36.50 --> 00:39:38.50
And life's like, oh, sorry.

952
00:39:38.50 --> 00:39:43.50
Because what you do, proper call is right turn 30 meters, right turn 500 meters,

953
00:39:43.50 --> 00:39:46.50
right turn 100 meters, right turn coming up, right turn boom.

954
00:39:46.50 --> 00:39:48.50
And that way the person can do it.

955
00:39:48.50 --> 00:39:49.50
Yeah.

956
00:39:49.50 --> 00:39:51.50
But life was pointing, but the guy couldn't see it.

957
00:39:51.50 --> 00:39:52.50
Yeah.

958
00:39:52.50 --> 00:39:54.50
But there's this very similar to your wife who's not pointing.

959
00:39:54.50 --> 00:39:56.50
Yeah, she wasn't pointing at the time.

960
00:39:56.50 --> 00:39:57.50
Well, here's the thing, too.

961
00:39:57.50 --> 00:39:58.50
And this is jamming up.

962
00:39:58.50 --> 00:40:00.50
Yeah, I'm not going to take too long in this one.

963
00:40:00.50 --> 00:40:02.50
But the way girls take your time.

964
00:40:02.50 --> 00:40:03.50
The girl, the way girls.

965
00:40:03.50 --> 00:40:05.50
Female females, girls.

966
00:40:05.50 --> 00:40:07.50
Take, you remember the last time you talked to the

967
00:40:07.50 --> 00:40:09.50
you generalized females, go ahead.

968
00:40:09.50 --> 00:40:10.50
At your peril.

969
00:40:10.50 --> 00:40:12.50
No, it wasn't my peril because that was the same thing.

970
00:40:12.50 --> 00:40:13.50
What?

971
00:40:13.50 --> 00:40:14.50
It was a joint of my skin.

972
00:40:14.50 --> 00:40:15.50
Yeah.

973
00:40:15.50 --> 00:40:15.50
Exactly.

974
00:40:15.50 --> 00:40:16.50
It's the same thing.

975
00:40:16.50 --> 00:40:17.50
Same deal.

976
00:40:17.50 --> 00:40:18.50
No one drew bike.

977
00:40:18.50 --> 00:40:19.50
No one drew bike.

978
00:40:19.50 --> 00:40:20.50
No, it's completely correct.

979
00:40:20.50 --> 00:40:21.50
No, no.

980
00:40:21.50 --> 00:40:23.50
Did you know someone drew you on a tricin?

981
00:40:23.50 --> 00:40:24.50
On a animated job.

982
00:40:24.50 --> 00:40:24.50
I was legit.

983
00:40:24.50 --> 00:40:25.50
It was very, very good.

984
00:40:25.50 --> 00:40:26.50
It was very, very good.

985
00:40:26.50 --> 00:40:27.50
Separate the point.

986
00:40:27.50 --> 00:40:28.50
But it was good.

987
00:40:28.50 --> 00:40:30.50
There was also some, there was also some pretty.

988
00:40:30.50 --> 00:40:34.50
Non-working bicycles that were drawn.

989
00:40:34.50 --> 00:40:34.50
Correct.

990
00:40:34.50 --> 00:40:35.50
Yeah.

991
00:40:35.50 --> 00:40:35.50
And I did it.

992
00:40:35.50 --> 00:40:42.50
And this by no means says, you know, the superiority or inferiority of any of the sex at all.

993
00:40:42.50 --> 00:40:45.50
I'm just saying there's a study done.

994
00:40:45.50 --> 00:40:51.50
Girls in guys interpret and give directions in completely different ways because of how they

995
00:40:51.50 --> 00:40:56.50
how they're brain formulates like directions.

996
00:40:56.50 --> 00:40:58.50
Girls kind of require this real generally.

997
00:40:58.50 --> 00:40:59.50
Girls require like land.

998
00:40:59.50 --> 00:41:02.50
And we're Jordan B. Peterson back on the top of this.

999
00:41:02.50 --> 00:41:03.50
Okay.

1000
00:41:03.50 --> 00:41:05.50
I want to add as much as you can.

1001
00:41:05.50 --> 00:41:10.50
So girls they prefer like landmarks and you know, like the voice on the thing.

1002
00:41:10.50 --> 00:41:12.50
Like, she'll be on this one.

1003
00:41:12.50 --> 00:41:13.50
So they can.

1004
00:41:13.50 --> 00:41:14.50
Wait, you mean the seary voice.

1005
00:41:14.50 --> 00:41:15.50
Seary voice, yeah, whatever.

1006
00:41:15.50 --> 00:41:16.50
Whatever.

1007
00:41:16.50 --> 00:41:17.50
Yeah.

1008
00:41:17.50 --> 00:41:18.50
I mean those can help guys too or whatever.

1009
00:41:18.50 --> 00:41:21.50
That navigation voice wasn't part of this study.

1010
00:41:21.50 --> 00:41:22.50
So I shouldn't mention the voice.

1011
00:41:22.50 --> 00:41:24.50
But they prefer like landmarks.

1012
00:41:24.50 --> 00:41:25.50
Like make or write.

1013
00:41:25.50 --> 00:41:25.50
Right.

1014
00:41:25.50 --> 00:41:26.50
Interesting.

1015
00:41:26.50 --> 00:41:27.50
In a building jet.

1016
00:41:27.50 --> 00:41:31.50
When when you're flying a jet plane.

1017
00:41:31.50 --> 00:41:32.50
Sure.

1018
00:41:32.50 --> 00:41:33.50
Yeah.

1019
00:41:33.50 --> 00:41:37.50
Which which I have done a backseat ride in F. 18 before.

1020
00:41:37.50 --> 00:41:43.50
But the voice that talks to you is a female voice and I was told that it's because it relaxes.

1021
00:41:43.50 --> 00:41:47.50
It gets the attention of and then kind of relaxes the pilots.

1022
00:41:47.50 --> 00:41:52.50
So it says like like when I was flying and I don't know why I wasn't like we were going to die.

1023
00:41:52.50 --> 00:41:54.50
But at all like I'm not sure.

1024
00:41:54.50 --> 00:41:55.50
Yeah.

1025
00:41:55.50 --> 00:41:57.50
But the thing would say warning.

1026
00:41:57.50 --> 00:41:59.50
It was a girl's voice and say warning.

1027
00:41:59.50 --> 00:42:00.50
Yeah.

1028
00:42:00.50 --> 00:42:04.50
And they say it's relaxing a little bit.

1029
00:42:04.50 --> 00:42:05.50
Yeah.

1030
00:42:05.50 --> 00:42:06.50
I could dig it.

1031
00:42:06.50 --> 00:42:11.50
You know typically if my wife is giving me directions it's not relaxing.

1032
00:42:11.50 --> 00:42:14.50
I'm not saying it's stressful but it's not relaxing.

1033
00:42:14.50 --> 00:42:15.50
So where were you going with this?

1034
00:42:15.50 --> 00:42:17.50
The girl that you said was going to be sure.

1035
00:42:17.50 --> 00:42:20.50
I'm just saying it's dangerous to do the directions thing.

1036
00:42:20.50 --> 00:42:24.50
The navigation thing with your wife or your girlfriend or with the girl.

1037
00:42:24.50 --> 00:42:25.50
With the girl.

1038
00:42:25.50 --> 00:42:29.50
Like if you let's say you and a girl in whatever capacity.

1039
00:42:29.50 --> 00:42:32.50
And whatever capacity is sitting next to you.

1040
00:42:32.50 --> 00:42:35.50
And you guys are you know how like when we're looking for the hotel.

1041
00:42:35.50 --> 00:42:35.50
Yeah.

1042
00:42:35.50 --> 00:42:37.50
You were both sort of looking for the hotel.

1043
00:42:37.50 --> 00:42:37.50
Yeah.

1044
00:42:37.50 --> 00:42:40.50
And we're both kind of navigating and then I failed.

1045
00:42:40.50 --> 00:42:41.50
Then you just jump and you remember that.

1046
00:42:41.50 --> 00:42:43.50
You actually debrief me.

1047
00:42:43.50 --> 00:42:43.50
Yeah.

1048
00:42:43.50 --> 00:42:46.50
You're like hey when it was time when I failed at Nav you were just like I got this here.

1049
00:42:46.50 --> 00:42:48.50
Right turn coming up 500 meters.

1050
00:42:48.50 --> 00:42:49.50
Right turn 200 meters.

1051
00:42:49.50 --> 00:42:50.50
Yeah.

1052
00:42:50.50 --> 00:42:51.50
Right turn 100 meters.

1053
00:42:51.50 --> 00:42:52.50
Right turn right turn right turn.

1054
00:42:52.50 --> 00:42:53.50
Okay.

1055
00:42:53.50 --> 00:42:55.50
Get it right hand lane and you were just like cool.

1056
00:42:55.50 --> 00:42:56.50
Yeah.

1057
00:42:56.50 --> 00:42:57.50
Yes.

1058
00:42:57.50 --> 00:42:58.50
So easy.

1059
00:42:58.50 --> 00:43:01.50
Consider that type of situation before you took over.

1060
00:43:01.50 --> 00:43:04.50
Consider that situation when you were both trying to navigate.

1061
00:43:04.50 --> 00:43:09.50
If you do that with a girl you you were more likely to run into problems because of this.

1062
00:43:09.50 --> 00:43:10.50
They interpret it.

1063
00:43:10.50 --> 00:43:11.50
They know what this is and you know.

1064
00:43:11.50 --> 00:43:14.50
They interpret and give directions in different ways because the brain works different.

1065
00:43:14.50 --> 00:43:18.50
They require like landmarks got kind of guide them like okay make a right.

1066
00:43:18.50 --> 00:43:19.50
At this make a left at this.

1067
00:43:19.50 --> 00:43:20.50
Okay.

1068
00:43:20.50 --> 00:43:21.50
That helps sure.

1069
00:43:21.50 --> 00:43:22.50
But it's more what the guys go off of.

1070
00:43:22.50 --> 00:43:24.50
They build a map in their head.

1071
00:43:24.50 --> 00:43:25.50
So if they're like okay.

1072
00:43:25.50 --> 00:43:26.50
Like if they looked at them.

1073
00:43:26.50 --> 00:43:29.50
They would be like okay they'd have a better understanding.

1074
00:43:29.50 --> 00:43:30.50
Okay.

1075
00:43:30.50 --> 00:43:32.50
So sure I can make a right at the building or whatever.

1076
00:43:32.50 --> 00:43:34.50
But when they make a right they're like okay I made that right.

1077
00:43:34.50 --> 00:43:40.50
So here I am physically oriented you know and they kind of just make sense of that way more than the girls do.

1078
00:43:40.50 --> 00:43:42.50
I'm not saying it's like one is black one is white.

1079
00:43:42.50 --> 00:43:45.50
I'm seeing one does one one one does more than I can see.

1080
00:43:45.50 --> 00:43:46.50
Yeah.

1081
00:43:46.50 --> 00:43:49.50
It's more than 10 times because it's how your mind works.

1082
00:43:49.50 --> 00:43:50.50
Okay.

1083
00:43:50.50 --> 00:43:52.50
This is just a study.

1084
00:43:52.50 --> 00:43:53.50
I didn't do the study.

1085
00:43:53.50 --> 00:43:54.50
Anyway.

1086
00:43:54.50 --> 00:43:58.50
I'm going to address this with echo on social media can address it to echo.

1087
00:43:58.50 --> 00:43:59.50
I'm out.

1088
00:43:59.50 --> 00:44:04.50
I will say this and I'll believe the study I sure will because I haven't been the other one.

1089
00:44:04.50 --> 00:44:06.50
As if you have it if you listen to all the podcast.

1090
00:44:06.50 --> 00:44:11.50
Echo also said that girls cannot draw off hand a functional bicycle.

1091
00:44:11.50 --> 00:44:12.50
bicycle.

1092
00:44:12.50 --> 00:44:13.50
Correct.

1093
00:44:13.50 --> 00:44:15.50
And he got a lot he got a lot of attempts.

1094
00:44:15.50 --> 00:44:16.50
Yeah.

1095
00:44:16.50 --> 00:44:19.50
And he did get one person that put a gift to gift.

1096
00:44:19.50 --> 00:44:20.50
Animated gift.

1097
00:44:20.50 --> 00:44:23.50
Animated gift of echo himself.

1098
00:44:23.50 --> 00:44:25.50
Riding a tricycle.

1099
00:44:25.50 --> 00:44:26.50
Yeah.

1100
00:44:26.50 --> 00:44:27.50
It was pretty awesome.

1101
00:44:27.50 --> 00:44:28.50
Yeah.

1102
00:44:28.50 --> 00:44:30.50
Again, beside the point.

1103
00:44:30.50 --> 00:44:31.50
But it was very, very awesome.

1104
00:44:31.50 --> 00:44:35.50
I don't even have any idea what the point of anything that we've said in the last few minutes.

1105
00:44:35.50 --> 00:44:37.50
And I don't even want you to try to point.

1106
00:44:37.50 --> 00:44:38.50
We're talking about miscommunication.

1107
00:44:38.50 --> 00:44:39.50
Like I can't read your mind.

1108
00:44:39.50 --> 00:44:40.50
You got a community.

1109
00:44:40.50 --> 00:44:42.50
You know, like he don't understand my perspective.

1110
00:44:42.50 --> 00:44:44.50
He's supposed to understand kind of thing.

1111
00:44:44.50 --> 00:44:45.50
You know, got it running into that.

1112
00:44:45.50 --> 00:44:46.50
Yes.

1113
00:44:46.50 --> 00:44:47.50
True man.

1114
00:44:47.50 --> 00:44:48.50
So you got to be clear.

1115
00:44:48.50 --> 00:44:49.50
He's what I'm saying.

1116
00:44:49.50 --> 00:44:52.50
Like how you were when we were finding that steak place or whatever.

1117
00:44:52.50 --> 00:44:53.50
That's where we were.

1118
00:44:53.50 --> 00:44:54.50
That was a good steak.

1119
00:44:54.50 --> 00:44:55.50
By the way.

1120
00:44:55.50 --> 00:44:56.50
Yes.

1121
00:44:56.50 --> 00:44:57.50
All right.

1122
00:44:57.50 --> 00:44:59.50
Next question.

1123
00:44:59.50 --> 00:45:03.50
Do you think we, do you think you would take up

1124
00:45:03.50 --> 00:45:07.50
Juditsu in your 40s if you had been introduced to something else in your 20s, like

1125
00:45:07.50 --> 00:45:09.50
Mointai boxing and such.

1126
00:45:09.50 --> 00:45:10.50
I'm struggling with Juditsu.

1127
00:45:10.50 --> 00:45:12.50
I respect that a lot out of it.

1128
00:45:12.50 --> 00:45:15.50
I have an easier time with boxing and kickboxing.

1129
00:45:15.50 --> 00:45:17.50
Just interesting.

1130
00:45:17.50 --> 00:45:20.50
I'm just making it a little bit like I have an easier time with these things.

1131
00:45:20.50 --> 00:45:21.50
Gotcha.

1132
00:45:21.50 --> 00:45:21.50
Yeah.

1133
00:45:21.50 --> 00:45:23.50
So that's why I'm going to focus on.

1134
00:45:23.50 --> 00:45:24.50
Yeah.

1135
00:45:24.50 --> 00:45:25.50
Maybe.

1136
00:45:25.50 --> 00:45:28.50
Just giving your most recent admission that you're, you are boring.

1137
00:45:28.50 --> 00:45:31.50
Obviously you're not because you're popular.

1138
00:45:31.50 --> 00:45:34.50
Do you think you'd pick it up later in life?

1139
00:45:34.50 --> 00:45:37.50
Juditsu to me is a chore.

1140
00:45:37.50 --> 00:45:39.50
Boxing kickboxing is fun.

1141
00:45:39.50 --> 00:45:43.50
I think because in my youth, I figured out how to move my body in that way.

1142
00:45:43.50 --> 00:45:45.50
I'm 43 by the way.

1143
00:45:45.50 --> 00:45:50.50
So first of all, do I think I would go to Juditsu or

1144
00:45:50.50 --> 00:45:56.50
start Juditsu or get into Juditsu in my 40s if I hadn't, if I had been, yes, absolutely.

1145
00:45:56.50 --> 00:45:57.50
100%.

1146
00:45:57.50 --> 00:46:00.50
The power of Juditsu is very real.

1147
00:46:00.50 --> 00:46:01.50
It's a real thing.

1148
00:46:01.50 --> 00:46:05.50
And once I recognized it, I wanted to have that power.

1149
00:46:05.50 --> 00:46:12.50
The power to choke people, arm walk them, dominate, win, like win with no mercy.

1150
00:46:12.50 --> 00:46:16.50
Now what's interesting about this is there's certain people like certain things.

1151
00:46:16.50 --> 00:46:23.50
And he even says like, I have an easier time with kickboxing and boxing because he's, he's part of that's because he's done it for a long time since this 20s.

1152
00:46:23.50 --> 00:46:24.50
So it's just easy for him.

1153
00:46:24.50 --> 00:46:32.50
And it like, Juditsu seems like a chore for him because you know what else he's getting beat up, you know, if he hasn't just getting into it now.

1154
00:46:32.50 --> 00:46:33.50
He's getting beat up.

1155
00:46:33.50 --> 00:46:34.50
He's getting chore.

1156
00:46:34.50 --> 00:46:35.50
Yeah, that's a chore man.

1157
00:46:35.50 --> 00:46:36.50
It's hard.

1158
00:46:36.50 --> 00:46:37.50
It's hard on the ego.

1159
00:46:37.50 --> 00:46:38.50
Yeah.

1160
00:46:38.50 --> 00:46:39.50
Yeah.

1161
00:46:39.50 --> 00:46:42.50
I thought of an interesting rule.

1162
00:46:42.50 --> 00:46:45.50
If you don't like Juditsu, if you don't think you like,

1163
00:46:45.50 --> 00:46:47.50
maybe you, what do you think of this rule?

1164
00:46:47.50 --> 00:46:53.50
If you don't think you like Juditsu, take it and I'll try to think of taking it for six months, take it for three months.

1165
00:46:53.50 --> 00:47:03.50
And I said, take it until you legitimately submit someone that is comparable in some way to you.

1166
00:47:03.50 --> 00:47:03.50
Yeah.

1167
00:47:03.50 --> 00:47:05.50
You think that's a good rule?

1168
00:47:05.50 --> 00:47:06.50
I think that's a good rule.

1169
00:47:06.50 --> 00:47:07.50
Yeah.

1170
00:47:07.50 --> 00:47:08.50
That's a good rule.

1171
00:47:08.50 --> 00:47:14.50
Because I'm not talking about you tap someone out that's weak and small or weaker than you and smaller than you.

1172
00:47:14.50 --> 00:47:16.50
And then you like, see, I can tap my normal equipment now.

1173
00:47:16.50 --> 00:47:25.50
No, I'm talking about someone that's equivalent to someone that has some comparable, like physical attributes to you.

1174
00:47:25.50 --> 00:47:34.50
Because I believe that once somebody gets the taste of the power and also this, this also implies or is actually,

1175
00:47:34.50 --> 00:47:41.50
if, if you train enough that you submit someone, that means you got submitted a thousand, probably 500 times.

1176
00:47:41.50 --> 00:47:42.50
Yeah.

1177
00:47:42.50 --> 00:47:43.50
I think that's a good number.

1178
00:47:43.50 --> 00:47:48.50
If you, by the time you submit, well, someone in Juditsu, you've probably been submitted 500 times.

1179
00:47:48.50 --> 00:47:49.50
Okay.

1180
00:47:49.50 --> 00:47:50.50
400 times.

1181
00:47:50.50 --> 00:47:51.50
300 times.

1182
00:47:51.50 --> 00:47:52.50
Yeah.

1183
00:47:52.50 --> 00:47:52.50
Yeah.

1184
00:47:52.50 --> 00:47:56.50
If you go to a Juditsu Academy as a white belt, zero training.

1185
00:47:56.50 --> 00:47:57.50
Yeah.

1186
00:47:57.50 --> 00:47:59.50
You're going to get submitted.

1187
00:47:59.50 --> 00:48:03.50
Four times, five times, six times, a class.

1188
00:48:03.50 --> 00:48:04.50
Right.

1189
00:48:04.50 --> 00:48:09.50
Well, it just depends if there's other white belts that are for second, third, fourth, fifth day,

1190
00:48:09.50 --> 00:48:10.50
for first month.

1191
00:48:10.50 --> 00:48:14.50
So you could, now, yeah, you could, depends.

1192
00:48:14.50 --> 00:48:16.50
And that you get submitted.

1193
00:48:16.50 --> 00:48:17.50
You're, oh, yeah.

1194
00:48:17.50 --> 00:48:18.50
Oh, yeah.

1195
00:48:18.50 --> 00:48:19.50
You're not having that.

1196
00:48:19.50 --> 00:48:20.50
It's, it's 300 times.

1197
00:48:20.50 --> 00:48:22.50
It's definitely more than 100.

1198
00:48:22.50 --> 00:48:24.50
But I wouldn't say before the time to 100 times in a week.

1199
00:48:24.50 --> 00:48:28.50
Wait, before it did, wait, it was, did you say before you kept up?

1200
00:48:28.50 --> 00:48:29.50
Anybody.

1201
00:48:29.50 --> 00:48:30.50
Yes.

1202
00:48:30.50 --> 00:48:31.50
Yeah.

1203
00:48:31.50 --> 00:48:32.50
That's going to depend.

1204
00:48:32.50 --> 00:48:35.50
If you have other white belts in first day, guys, let's say you've, of course, you've been training

1205
00:48:35.50 --> 00:48:36.50
for three weeks.

1206
00:48:36.50 --> 00:48:37.50
You can tap out something that hasn't been training.

1207
00:48:37.50 --> 00:48:38.50
Yeah.

1208
00:48:38.50 --> 00:48:39.50
Yeah.

1209
00:48:39.50 --> 00:48:39.50
That's how fast you can learn a Juditsu.

1210
00:48:39.50 --> 00:48:39.50
Yeah.

1211
00:48:39.50 --> 00:48:43.50
When I, the first moves that I learned, I didn't, I probably knew like a month's worth of

1212
00:48:43.50 --> 00:48:47.50
Juditsu, but no one could hang with me because I knew like the basics, though.

1213
00:48:47.50 --> 00:48:48.50
I don't even knew what to do.

1214
00:48:48.50 --> 00:48:49.50
Yeah.

1215
00:48:49.50 --> 00:48:50.50
Yeah.

1216
00:48:50.50 --> 00:48:52.50
Consider a rear naked choke.

1217
00:48:52.50 --> 00:48:56.50
All you have to do is you can learn the rear naked choke one day in the beginning of class.

1218
00:48:56.50 --> 00:48:59.50
And all you have to figure out when you roll.

1219
00:48:59.50 --> 00:49:02.50
If a guy doesn't have much experience, all you have to figure out is how to get on his back.

1220
00:49:02.50 --> 00:49:03.50
It's all you got to do.

1221
00:49:03.50 --> 00:49:05.50
It's really cool when you teach kids Juditsu.

1222
00:49:05.50 --> 00:49:07.50
Like you can say something like,

1223
00:49:07.50 --> 00:49:11.50
you could give them the class on how to pass the guard.

1224
00:49:11.50 --> 00:49:11.50
Yeah.

1225
00:49:11.50 --> 00:49:12.50
Right.

1226
00:49:12.50 --> 00:49:16.50
And they would start to do what you told them to do, or you could say,

1227
00:49:16.50 --> 00:49:20.50
Okay, your goal is to get out of their legs and get around.

1228
00:49:20.50 --> 00:49:21.50
Yeah.

1229
00:49:21.50 --> 00:49:22.50
And they'll figure out how to do it.

1230
00:49:22.50 --> 00:49:23.50
Yeah.

1231
00:49:23.50 --> 00:49:24.50
And it's pretty awesome.

1232
00:49:24.50 --> 00:49:25.50
Yeah.

1233
00:49:25.50 --> 00:49:26.50
And then what you do is you give a couple little pointers.

1234
00:49:26.50 --> 00:49:27.50
Yeah.

1235
00:49:27.50 --> 00:49:30.50
Because their instincts will be a little bit off, but you can look a couple little pointers.

1236
00:49:30.50 --> 00:49:33.50
A couple things to work with and then they'll develop those and some really cool stuff.

1237
00:49:33.50 --> 00:49:34.50
Yeah.

1238
00:49:34.50 --> 00:49:38.50
And I don't know if I said this before, but that even is true.

1239
00:49:38.50 --> 00:49:41.50
That is much, but it's still true with adults.

1240
00:49:41.50 --> 00:49:42.50
Yeah.

1241
00:49:42.50 --> 00:49:46.50
Because if you teach them the technique first and then you say, hey, that those techniques I taught you,

1242
00:49:46.50 --> 00:49:49.50
that's passing the guard and it doesn't.

1243
00:49:49.50 --> 00:49:50.50
It's way easier to like get.

1244
00:49:50.50 --> 00:49:54.50
It's almost like getting a big piece of clay and being like, okay, make the head,

1245
00:49:54.50 --> 00:49:56.50
make the body, make the arms that's it.

1246
00:49:56.50 --> 00:49:58.50
And then they're like, okay, now you got the arms that's cool.

1247
00:49:58.50 --> 00:50:00.50
Now I'll make the fingers.

1248
00:50:00.50 --> 00:50:03.50
Now I'll make the, you know, and then start to go with the details there as far as the technical

1249
00:50:03.50 --> 00:50:06.50
techniques with like passing the guard.

1250
00:50:06.50 --> 00:50:12.50
But that's all actually that's how I learned from Dean where he would teach stuff.

1251
00:50:12.50 --> 00:50:16.50
But I would just see him like getting past and I know, okay, when he gets past you,

1252
00:50:16.50 --> 00:50:17.50
that's like hard to get out of.

1253
00:50:17.50 --> 00:50:19.50
So that's what I want to try to do.

1254
00:50:19.50 --> 00:50:20.50
And one guy's would get past the firm.

1255
00:50:20.50 --> 00:50:21.50
Yeah.

1256
00:50:21.50 --> 00:50:27.50
So I thought that it really worked better that way to just to teach that way.

1257
00:50:27.50 --> 00:50:29.50
If someone's starting from zero.

1258
00:50:29.50 --> 00:50:30.50
Yeah.

1259
00:50:30.50 --> 00:50:32.50
Because it's hard to put into context when you don't know anything.

1260
00:50:32.50 --> 00:50:34.50
Like yeah, I'm doing this cool light's pretty cool.

1261
00:50:34.50 --> 00:50:37.50
It's doing the intro class at the master.

1262
00:50:37.50 --> 00:50:39.50
Because you have a lot of people that never done to you to do it.

1263
00:50:39.50 --> 00:50:40.50
Yeah.

1264
00:50:40.50 --> 00:50:40.50
Yeah.

1265
00:50:40.50 --> 00:50:44.50
And that's like how and how you're saying to teach is exactly how we teach.

1266
00:50:44.50 --> 00:50:44.50
Yeah.

1267
00:50:44.50 --> 00:50:47.50
That's like, hey, this is the concept and then we teach a couple little moves of like what

1268
00:50:47.50 --> 00:50:50.50
to do there and then you watch people get after it and they do get it.

1269
00:50:50.50 --> 00:50:50.50
Yeah.

1270
00:50:50.50 --> 00:50:51.50
It's pretty cool.

1271
00:50:51.50 --> 00:50:52.50
Yeah.

1272
00:50:52.50 --> 00:50:55.50
But yes, here the reason for this.

1273
00:50:55.50 --> 00:50:59.50
And this school's for anything by the way, if you are successful, especially if they're all,

1274
00:50:59.50 --> 00:51:02.50
if they're kind of similar like in this case where he's like, okay, martial arts, right?

1275
00:51:02.50 --> 00:51:05.50
You do, you do, I'm going to start you do it to way late.

1276
00:51:05.50 --> 00:51:08.50
Meanwhile, I have experience doing,

1277
00:51:08.50 --> 00:51:09.50
a very time boxing.

1278
00:51:09.50 --> 00:51:14.50
So if he has experience assuming he's been somewhat successful, not in a certain competition,

1279
00:51:14.50 --> 00:51:16.50
but not not competition, just so he knows what he's doing.

1280
00:51:16.50 --> 00:51:21.50
When he throws a punch, he can have a level of success of that punch landing.

1281
00:51:21.50 --> 00:51:24.50
You know, like, and it's going to be pretty often if he has 20 years experience,

1282
00:51:24.50 --> 00:51:26.50
he can take whatever.

1283
00:51:26.50 --> 00:51:30.50
So he's experiencing little, how should I say little,

1284
00:51:30.50 --> 00:51:33.50
micro successes when he jumps in the boxing situation.

1285
00:51:33.50 --> 00:51:36.50
And when you take a jetzery's getting a lot of failure.

1286
00:51:36.50 --> 00:51:39.50
After all, it's a huge chore.

1287
00:51:39.50 --> 00:51:40.50
And that's life.

1288
00:51:40.50 --> 00:51:45.50
So if you're, if you're going in with nothing, you have no micro, you know,

1289
00:51:45.50 --> 00:51:47.50
success is no nothing.

1290
00:51:47.50 --> 00:51:48.50
You're just going in.

1291
00:51:48.50 --> 00:51:49.50
I don't train anything.

1292
00:51:49.50 --> 00:51:50.50
I go in, sure.

1293
00:51:50.50 --> 00:51:51.50
I'll take some hits.

1294
00:51:51.50 --> 00:51:53.50
I'll take some failures because I'm learning this new thing.

1295
00:51:53.50 --> 00:51:58.50
But if you have it compared to, look, I'm going to come into victory MMA.

1296
00:51:58.50 --> 00:52:00.50
I'm going to see the kickboxing situation going on.

1297
00:52:00.50 --> 00:52:02.50
I'm going to say jetzery situation going on.

1298
00:52:02.50 --> 00:52:05.50
My brain is automatically going to be like, okay, what's going to be the best experience

1299
00:52:05.50 --> 00:52:06.50
from your hand?

1300
00:52:06.50 --> 00:52:07.50
Micro victories.

1301
00:52:07.50 --> 00:52:10.50
If I'm going to go where the victories are, I'm going to go where the payoff is.

1302
00:52:10.50 --> 00:52:12.50
You know, those payoffs where I can land punches.

1303
00:52:12.50 --> 00:52:13.50
I can do it.

1304
00:52:13.50 --> 00:52:14.50
I can know what I'm doing.

1305
00:52:14.50 --> 00:52:15.50
Dang.

1306
00:52:15.50 --> 00:52:17.50
When I move my body, it does what I want it to do.

1307
00:52:17.50 --> 00:52:19.50
And it yield success.

1308
00:52:19.50 --> 00:52:20.50
Yeah, it's effective.

1309
00:52:20.50 --> 00:52:25.50
Or I can go to jjitsu and where everyone else has success.

1310
00:52:25.50 --> 00:52:26.50
Everyone else is getting their payoff.

1311
00:52:26.50 --> 00:52:27.50
Not me, by the way.

1312
00:52:27.50 --> 00:52:28.50
Everyone else is.

1313
00:52:28.50 --> 00:52:32.50
I'm getting tapped out and that part in and of itself is like, that's, especially if you're

1314
00:52:32.50 --> 00:52:33.50
a guy.

1315
00:52:33.50 --> 00:52:37.50
Is it a personality thing where some people, as soon as they get,

1316
00:52:37.50 --> 00:52:41.50
as soon as they get tapped into jjitsu, they're like, oh my god, I need to learn this immediately.

1317
00:52:41.50 --> 00:52:42.50
Like, kiss.

1318
00:52:42.50 --> 00:52:44.50
You know, when you, you don't people get the jjitsu bug?

1319
00:52:44.50 --> 00:52:45.50
Yeah, sure.

1320
00:52:45.50 --> 00:52:46.50
Yeah.

1321
00:52:46.50 --> 00:52:48.50
That would not everyone gets the jjitsu bug, right?

1322
00:52:48.50 --> 00:52:49.50
Not everyone.

1323
00:52:49.50 --> 00:52:50.50
There's a lot of people, though.

1324
00:52:50.50 --> 00:52:53.50
Well, what percentage of people get the jjitsu bug?

1325
00:52:53.50 --> 00:52:55.50
Oh, dang, I am 20%.

1326
00:52:55.50 --> 00:52:57.50
That'd be percent.

1327
00:52:57.50 --> 00:52:58.50
Depends.

1328
00:52:58.50 --> 00:53:02.50
Like, 20% of who, all people people start human beings.

1329
00:53:02.50 --> 00:53:03.50
Yeah.

1330
00:53:03.50 --> 00:53:04.50
It's probably not even 20%.

1331
00:53:04.50 --> 00:53:05.50
Yeah.

1332
00:53:05.50 --> 00:53:09.50
It's weird as much as there is jjitsu.

1333
00:53:09.50 --> 00:53:13.50
As much as we talk about it in a very positive way.

1334
00:53:13.50 --> 00:53:16.50
People normal people have a hard time with it.

1335
00:53:16.50 --> 00:53:18.50
It's weird for me to admit that.

1336
00:53:18.50 --> 00:53:23.50
But if I think about it, and I've talked about this before, like, all the people that

1337
00:53:23.50 --> 00:53:33.50
I've introduced jjitsu over the years, I think I have, like, maybe four blockbelts of people that I fully like they started jjitsu because of me.

1338
00:53:33.50 --> 00:53:37.50
I'm talking, so that with those percentages, it's very, very small.

1339
00:53:37.50 --> 00:53:39.50
People that actually stick with it and get the bug.

1340
00:53:39.50 --> 00:53:40.50
Yeah.

1341
00:53:40.50 --> 00:53:41.50
Why not even four?

1342
00:53:41.50 --> 00:53:44.50
And, but you, and you can get the bug and the bug kind of whereoff.

1343
00:53:44.50 --> 00:53:45.50
You know how that is?

1344
00:53:45.50 --> 00:53:46.50
Where?

1345
00:53:46.50 --> 00:53:47.50
You know?

1346
00:53:47.50 --> 00:53:48.50
I remember.

1347
00:53:48.50 --> 00:53:49.50
Then that's not the bug.

1348
00:53:49.50 --> 00:53:50.50
That's not the real bug.

1349
00:53:50.50 --> 00:53:51.50
That's not the real bug.

1350
00:53:51.50 --> 00:53:52.50
That's like the diet.

1351
00:53:52.50 --> 00:53:54.50
Jjitsu bug or something.

1352
00:53:54.50 --> 00:53:55.50
Bug light.

1353
00:53:55.50 --> 00:53:56.50
Exactly.

1354
00:53:56.50 --> 00:53:57.50
Yeah.

1355
00:53:57.50 --> 00:54:02.50
Well, it's a bug light because people get purple belt and then they don't show up anymore.

1356
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:03.50
People can brown belt, they don't show people.

1357
00:54:03.50 --> 00:54:04.50
Yeah.

1358
00:54:04.50 --> 00:54:06.50
People can't get blue belt and they don't show up anymore.

1359
00:54:06.50 --> 00:54:07.50
Yeah.

1360
00:54:07.50 --> 00:54:08.50
Yeah.

1361
00:54:08.50 --> 00:54:09.50
And then there's people get the word.

1362
00:54:09.50 --> 00:54:10.50
Keep training.

1363
00:54:10.50 --> 00:54:11.50
Yeah.

1364
00:54:11.50 --> 00:54:12.50
That's the bug.

1365
00:54:12.50 --> 00:54:13.50
That's the real bug.

1366
00:54:13.50 --> 00:54:14.50
Yeah.

1367
00:54:14.50 --> 00:54:17.50
That's like when you dream about it, you know how like you're dreaming.

1368
00:54:17.50 --> 00:54:18.50
You're learning to move and you'll dream up there.

1369
00:54:18.50 --> 00:54:23.50
It'll just kind of be in your think in your mind, you know, it's kind of the subconscious.

1370
00:54:23.50 --> 00:54:26.50
I thought that that was kind of it, but in my experience that that goes away somehow.

1371
00:54:26.50 --> 00:54:27.50
It depends on what you're into.

1372
00:54:27.50 --> 00:54:28.50
Mm.

1373
00:54:28.50 --> 00:54:29.50
But I don't know.

1374
00:54:29.50 --> 00:54:30.50
Yeah.

1375
00:54:30.50 --> 00:54:31.50
But nonetheless, he, that's it.

1376
00:54:31.50 --> 00:54:34.50
That's what I think because that's pretty common.

1377
00:54:34.50 --> 00:54:35.50
Yeah.

1378
00:54:35.50 --> 00:54:36.50
That's the pressure.

1379
00:54:36.50 --> 00:54:37.50
So it was there.

1380
00:54:37.50 --> 00:54:38.50
It was like an actual advice.

1381
00:54:38.50 --> 00:54:39.50
Yeah.

1382
00:54:39.50 --> 00:54:40.50
Like, you think you think you, it's.

1383
00:54:40.50 --> 00:54:41.50
Yeah.

1384
00:54:41.50 --> 00:54:42.50
I would have.

1385
00:54:42.50 --> 00:54:43.50
That's what my answers are.

1386
00:54:43.50 --> 00:54:43.50
Yes.

1387
00:54:43.50 --> 00:54:43.50
I would have.

1388
00:54:43.50 --> 00:54:44.50
Well, but it's again, but you have to have this that actually you know on.

1389
00:54:44.50 --> 00:54:45.50
I thought it, but when you said it and where kill the full feeding your food right um.

1390
00:54:45.50 --> 00:54:49.50
And then show that even I please, what once said, can I make more fun with these things towards you?

1391
00:54:49.50 --> 00:54:54.50
Think again if you did get an idea to life or anything with you gets hungry upgienery.

1392
00:54:54.50 --> 00:55:00.50
Like, actually we wanted that to come right through to God.

1393
00:55:00.50 --> 00:55:07.000
people to train with other people that gave me the hardest runs. Yeah, and my absolute most favorite people to train with other people that actually can get me.

1394
00:55:07.50 --> 00:55:14.18
You know, but it's again when you have to have this there's this third factor here where the kickbox scene in box

1395
00:55:14.18 --> 00:55:19.90
It's right there. I could be right there right now and when he's meaning, you know, just doing it and

1396
00:55:20.98 --> 00:55:26.96
But I'm not I'm over here and this guy's mountain on me and he's yeah, he's choking me and stuff like this man

1397
00:55:26.96 --> 00:55:34.08
It's I date man. It makes me so I guess we could reverse this question say like okay, joccal then when why why aren't you in boxing and striking all the time

1398
00:55:34.08 --> 00:55:37.12
For me that's a pretty it's actually not that hard of an answer

1399
00:55:37.12 --> 00:55:46.50
I've done boxing and striking and the thing that is different is in boxing and striking even though you're talking about micro wins

1400
00:55:47.50 --> 00:55:51.04
Most of the nights of training boxing or kickboxing

1401
00:55:51.04 --> 00:55:56.04
They're the micro wins are against pads and a bag

1402
00:55:56.40 --> 00:56:00.84
Right because you're not sparring every night and if you are sparring every night, you're making a mistake

1403
00:56:01.40 --> 00:56:05.76
Yeah, and you're not even going as hard as you're not compared to the yeah, I mean you can have fun

1404
00:56:05.76 --> 00:56:10.08
We do that too like we we call it playing tag where you're like you're like touching the person you're you're

1405
00:56:10.24 --> 00:56:15.12
It's almost like a slap fight, you know, but you can't do that ever you can't sparring every night

1406
00:56:15.12 --> 00:56:18.000
And you shouldn't sparring every night if you are sparring every night

1407
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:26.24
You're wrong but you can roll every night. Yeah, you can get you can get full victories not micro victories full on some missions

1408
00:56:27.28 --> 00:56:31.04
Yeah, yeah, and I agree and I think that if you

1409
00:56:32.24 --> 00:56:37.76
That it did say it really depends on who you are but to me that was the the big time appeal and

1410
00:56:38.32 --> 00:56:41.52
Still is the legitimate appeal of

1411
00:56:41.52 --> 00:56:48.08
Juditsu where you know like people even now they'll be like hey, but this martial arts is superior because this and that but

1412
00:56:49.20 --> 00:56:54.36
Really, Juditsu's kind of being tested the best because it's going against in every day

1413
00:56:54.36 --> 00:56:57.12
All speed enemy enemy quote unquote enemy

1414
00:56:57.12 --> 00:57:00.88
You're funny when people are like how would you ever get someone's armed there

1415
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.56
You don't even know me. Yeah, they're like oh, yeah, you get to get eat that. I'm locked try that on me. It's like, oh, okay. Yeah

1416
00:57:06.88 --> 00:57:08.88
What's that just reading about it didn't?

1417
00:57:08.88 --> 00:57:15.36
Gordon Ryan just beat somebody he let called it yeah, he called it minimal more seven

1418
00:57:15.52 --> 00:57:19.28
Yeah, he was like I'm gonna beat you with this and he did it within this amount of time

1419
00:57:19.52 --> 00:57:24.16
Did it that's by the way yeah, and that's how it is man and that's against a high level guy

1420
00:57:24.16 --> 00:57:27.36
Well, Gordon Ryan's obviously one of the best guys right now

1421
00:57:28.48 --> 00:57:34.96
But that that is kind of how juditsu is you know unless it's like some that's huge giant like football player

1422
00:57:34.96 --> 00:57:40.32
Just spashing and riding away the whole time if you're it's something engaging you that's kind of how it is where you're like oh

1423
00:57:40.32 --> 00:57:43.60
I can choke if they don't know you just and you know

1424
00:57:43.60 --> 00:57:47.02
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. They're like you just make it my arm there

1425
00:57:47.02 --> 00:57:48.96
Gordon Ryan did not do that to someone that didn't know

1426
00:57:48.96 --> 00:57:52.88
I know only that's the funny because that's those those those are the Hicks in stories

1427
00:57:52.96 --> 00:57:58.08
You know like Hicks and would be like I'm gonna every all of you 14 black belts

1428
00:57:58.08 --> 00:58:03.36
I'm gonna arm lock your left arm all of you and you do it all of black belts

1429
00:58:03.84 --> 00:58:04.84
Yeah

1430
00:58:04.84 --> 00:58:09.88
That's it. You heard those stories right? Yeah, I rolled with Hicks and I've talked about that before yeah

1431
00:58:10.20 --> 00:58:12.20
Hicks is really good at you, too

1432
00:58:13.16 --> 00:58:14.20
Sure

1433
00:58:14.44 --> 00:58:19.32
Yeah, but yes, but I don't know though. So what do you do though like what what's your no effect it's right?

1434
00:58:19.32 --> 00:58:23.32
It's not on our back to it. My advice is that like I said that's why I think my new rule is

1435
00:58:23.80 --> 00:58:28.92
Train until you submit someone that is legitimately comparable to you

1436
00:58:29.48 --> 00:58:31.48
And then if you don't like it still

1437
00:58:31.48 --> 00:58:36.84
Didn't don't train like I there was one guy on social media that like kept coming back to me like I know I hate you get to you

1438
00:58:36.84 --> 00:58:39.48
I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I was like after awhile

1439
00:58:39.48 --> 00:58:43.32
I'm like okay, can you defend yourself against you know I take down can you get up from the bottom?

1440
00:58:43.32 --> 00:58:46.44
Okay, then go find something else to do and quick complaining to me about it

1441
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.60
Like everyone is not meant for you to I get it. Yeah. Fine

1442
00:58:51.32 --> 00:58:55.32
Yeah, I almost but it's still is beneficial though feels like it is for

1443
00:58:55.96 --> 00:59:00.60
That's what it feels like that's why I'm saying that's what it feels like to you and me and to the people that we hang out with

1444
00:59:00.60 --> 00:59:04.52
And that's why when I was saying like some people don't like you get to it's really weird for me

1445
00:59:04.52 --> 00:59:08.68
Yeah, I have a hard time with their perspective. Yeah, you're gonna be

1446
00:59:08.68 --> 00:59:11.88
That's really Mr. Mr. Understand their perspective

1447
00:59:12.12 --> 00:59:14.36
And you tell me like I don't really like you did so it's like why?

1448
00:59:15.32 --> 00:59:16.60
Why would you not like it?

1449
00:59:16.60 --> 00:59:20.60
Straight up. Yeah, God you don't like it makes life easier for me one person

1450
00:59:20.60 --> 00:59:23.48
I'm not afraid about being able to choke me. Yeah for sure

1451
00:59:23.48 --> 00:59:30.20
Okay, I would say this try this if you in this situation this is what I would do

1452
00:59:32.20 --> 00:59:36.20
Try to forget about but like when you're like okay, I'm gonna go jujitsu today

1453
00:59:36.76 --> 00:59:41.64
Forget about boxing as a concept forget about kickbox forget about it like don't don't think about that

1454
00:59:41.64 --> 00:59:44.92
Like your whole thing right now is like it's just jujitsu and

1455
00:59:45.40 --> 00:59:48.60
Or think of it as like just this complete learning experience

1456
00:59:48.92 --> 00:59:53.40
Of course but forget about the boxing because anytime like that's how that's what's gonna

1457
00:59:53.40 --> 00:59:56.84
Happened when you keep that boxing on your mind or the keep boxing on your mind

1458
00:59:56.84 --> 01:00:01.40
You're like for why am I doing this when I could be doing boxing which was like bad ass anyway, you know kind of thing

1459
01:00:02.44 --> 01:00:04.44
But just forget about it

1460
01:00:04.44 --> 01:00:05.72
Yeah

1461
01:00:05.72 --> 01:00:12.20
I think that's the thing you know how like guys in the UFC that'll that'll happen sometimes where they're super good at jujitsu

1462
01:00:12.20 --> 01:00:21.40
Yeah, and then the train boxing it's like funny. Yeah, and it's vice versa too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I was just saying like some people and this is true with fighters some fighters don't like

1463
01:00:21.40 --> 01:00:27.32
Striking they don't like to get hit specifically no one minds punching people some people like it

1464
01:00:27.72 --> 01:00:31.08
Some people like they they truly like to punch someone else in the head

1465
01:00:31.48 --> 01:00:34.12
Some people are good with it most people are good with it because it feels good

1466
01:00:34.68 --> 01:00:37.80
Some people don't like to get hit they really don't like that

1467
01:00:38.44 --> 01:00:44.60
Some people don't like to get smashed on the ground they get claustrophobic right then like that

1468
01:00:45.32 --> 01:00:47.32
And so different people have a little different

1469
01:00:47.32 --> 01:00:52.12
I don't know if calm weakness is but preferences yeah, and you can see that very clearly

1470
01:00:52.36 --> 01:00:58.68
Especially in the earlier UFC's nowadays you're not getting the UFC if you're super uncomfortable in any arena of

1471
01:00:59.24 --> 01:01:03.32
martial arts if you're just if you're just super uncomfortable stand up

1472
01:01:03.32 --> 01:01:07.64
You you you you you know maybe you might make it under a card barely, but you don't see that on me

1473
01:01:07.64 --> 01:01:15.72
Yeah, I like that really do it until you tap someone out. Yeah, it's like legit

1474
01:01:15.72 --> 01:01:19.80
Yeah, comparable to you because what I think happens once you do that

1475
01:01:22.20 --> 01:01:27.08
And you got the benefit of getting tapped out which is a bet which to me motivates me more than just tapping someone out

1476
01:01:27.08 --> 01:01:32.20
Yeah, like how did someone control me think about that another human being can control me completely

1477
01:01:32.84 --> 01:01:36.44
Did Dean those that to me sometimes and I'm sitting here thinking to myself. I'm like man

1478
01:01:36.44 --> 01:01:43.24
I've been training for a really long time and I'm a grown man in good physical condition

1479
01:01:43.24 --> 01:01:46.20
Relatively strong and he can

1480
01:01:46.60 --> 01:01:53.000
Cold me in a position where I cannot do anything and I can actually do that to him too not as clearly not as often

1481
01:01:54.20 --> 01:01:57.96
But like we he's got he's got three physicians. He can do it to me

1482
01:01:57.96 --> 01:01:59.96
And I think he can cross side mount

1483
01:02:01.96 --> 01:02:08.04
And on all force right if I'm in one of those positions or he's one of those positions on me

1484
01:02:08.04 --> 01:02:14.76
He I'm doomed to do for me. It's only I don't have mount on him. His mount escape is awesome and my mount's not really good

1485
01:02:14.92 --> 01:02:19.80
So he's he can get out of that so it's no big deal, but cross side or when he's on all force

1486
01:02:20.44 --> 01:02:24.04
I'm gonna torture him and we both know we're gonna get tortured in those positions

1487
01:02:24.36 --> 01:02:27.56
For him it's too busy for him. He either's two positions. He's gonna get tortured in for me

1488
01:02:27.56 --> 01:02:31.24
There's three positions. I'm gonna get tortured tortured tortured. Yeah tortured. Yes, sir. Oh

1489
01:02:31.88 --> 01:02:34.68
You've seen it. Yeah, yeah, you felt it, too

1490
01:02:34.68 --> 01:02:37.40
Yeah, both examples all

1491
01:02:37.40 --> 01:02:42.20
Example except the mount though. I can escape mount you have good. Yeah, no mountain escape. Yeah, you have big escape

1492
01:02:42.20 --> 01:02:45.24
So not as but yeah, no, that's bad. I dig it

1493
01:02:45.80 --> 01:02:50.20
That isn't that weird though. You have you know 25 over 25 years experience

1494
01:02:50.76 --> 01:02:55.48
Train very strong and big by the way like compared to like a normal duty to guy like you're a big you're a

1495
01:02:56.28 --> 01:02:58.28
Think that's huge

1496
01:02:58.28 --> 01:03:03.88
Played you did to player big strong experience know what to do know what not to do all that doesn't mean anything

1497
01:03:03.88 --> 01:03:09.24
I think that's for that moment. Don't even mean nothing. Yeah. Holy cow. Yeah. That's a scary thing. Yeah

1498
01:03:10.44 --> 01:03:12.44
Next question. Good evening

1499
01:03:12.84 --> 01:03:14.84
I'm a firefighter paramedic and

1500
01:03:15.72 --> 01:03:23.16
I'm still the rookie at my station the fire services notorious for politics within the ranks and rookie's often get the worst of it

1501
01:03:23.16 --> 01:03:29.000
My question is how can I implement extreme ownership in a situation where the blame falls to me anyway

1502
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.56
How can I have my superior view this as a positive trait when every rookie gets the short end of the stick

1503
01:03:36.28 --> 01:03:39.40
And when none of my superiors are willing to engage in extreme ownership

1504
01:03:39.80 --> 01:03:45.80
I'm taking ownership however the typical response along is along the lines of that's correct. It is your phone

1505
01:03:48.04 --> 01:03:50.04
Yeah

1506
01:03:50.04 --> 01:03:52.04
You know what

1507
01:03:52.76 --> 01:03:54.76
That's correct. It is your fault

1508
01:03:54.76 --> 01:03:59.08
That's what extreme ownership is that's what it is

1509
01:03:59.64 --> 01:04:01.64
That's what it is

1510
01:04:02.84 --> 01:04:04.84
That's what it is

1511
01:04:04.84 --> 01:04:08.92
That's what extreme ownership it is you're saying it's your fault. You're not just saying it so they leave you alone

1512
01:04:08.92 --> 01:04:12.84
You're saying it because you're taking ownership of it then you can fix what is wrong

1513
01:04:14.52 --> 01:04:18.92
That's what it is. So and I will tell you the boss will notice

1514
01:04:18.92 --> 01:04:25.40
He will he'll notice and the people above you in the chain of command will notice they will notice that you are taking ownership

1515
01:04:25.40 --> 01:04:31.40
They will notice it yourself in problems. I'll notice that that will then give you a good reputation

1516
01:04:32.36 --> 01:04:39.80
But taking extreme ownership does not absolve you of the blame that's what's the opposite of that

1517
01:04:42.68 --> 01:04:46.76
You are at fault. That's the whole point. That's the whole point and

1518
01:04:46.76 --> 01:04:50.84
This is one of those classic questions I get asked all the time

1519
01:04:51.48 --> 01:04:53.16
It's like what if they say it?

1520
01:04:53.16 --> 01:04:56.12
What if they say that's right it is your fault. That's what you're saying

1521
01:04:57.96 --> 01:05:01.24
So it doesn't matter. It's true in business

1522
01:05:01.56 --> 01:05:07.000
And it's true in life too if you're blaming other people for things that are going wrong you're not going to fix them

1523
01:05:07.80 --> 01:05:11.32
You can't fix them because in your mind you don't control them. They're not your fault. So

1524
01:05:12.60 --> 01:05:14.60
If you want to take extreme ownership

1525
01:05:14.60 --> 01:05:21.56
At work and in business and in life stop blaming other people and blame yourself and realize that it

1526
01:05:21.56 --> 01:05:27.16
It actually is your fault that's correct own it and do something about it

1527
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Do you think that sometimes

1528
01:05:33.80 --> 01:05:36.84
Like this you know how some people will

1529
01:05:37.64 --> 01:05:41.40
At like at the monsters people will say they'll ask you this and they'll say it'll be similar to this

1530
01:05:41.40 --> 01:05:46.28
Where it will be like like I'm trying to take extreme ownership, but you know something like this happens

1531
01:05:46.92 --> 01:05:53.88
And then you say well yeah like you take extreme ownership you actually take the blame and then you talk about how you're going to fix the problem

1532
01:05:53.88 --> 01:05:57.96
Right like that's how you do you don't just take you don't say yes my fault and then boom

1533
01:05:57.96 --> 01:05:59.96
Work good work done my bus kind of thing

1534
01:06:01.64 --> 01:06:08.76
It's for that's ego it's funny because your ego is like if I say like echo this went wrong and it's my fault

1535
01:06:08.76 --> 01:06:15.48
And then you go yeah, yeah, you should have done a better job. I get that's that's my defam like

1536
01:06:15.48 --> 01:06:19.08
What are you talking about? Well, you know, I you know, I would have been able to do a better if you were to dumb

1537
01:06:19.80 --> 01:06:25.08
So even though I'm saying I'm taking the initiative. I'm not actually taking ownership. Yeah, so that was actually going to be

1538
01:06:25.40 --> 01:06:26.68
Like a statement

1539
01:06:26.68 --> 01:06:28.92
It's just people so it's almost like

1540
01:06:29.88 --> 01:06:32.12
Maybe not but it's almost like

1541
01:06:33.64 --> 01:06:37.72
Like let's say I did something and I messed up. I caught my own mistake right in the middle of doing it

1542
01:06:37.72 --> 01:06:39.72
I was like man. I'm so dumb and it was a dumb mistake

1543
01:06:39.72 --> 01:06:42.76
What I'm so dumb and you said yeah, you're a dumb and I'm like wait don't call me dumb

1544
01:06:43.16 --> 01:06:44.52
Right, it's kind of like that right?

1545
01:06:44.76 --> 01:06:47.16
Just like man you just said you're dumb kind of thing

1546
01:06:47.56 --> 01:06:50.60
You know what else is funny as to you hear people make excuses

1547
01:06:51.64 --> 01:06:53.64
like

1548
01:06:54.12 --> 01:06:58.28
But instead of taking the blame instead of taking owning the excuse they they

1549
01:06:59.08 --> 01:07:01.08
So like let's say

1550
01:07:01.32 --> 01:07:03.32
I wasn't prepared for a podcast

1551
01:07:03.32 --> 01:07:10.84
Or let's say no I said hey we're gonna we can try and record on Wednesday, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it because I have this going on and my

1552
01:07:11.24 --> 01:07:13.24
Dog did this and my kid did that

1553
01:07:14.12 --> 01:07:16.12
And I'm I'm making excuses

1554
01:07:17.40 --> 01:07:25.32
Instead of saying like hey, I didn't plan well enough and I didn't anticipate some things that I should have anticipated and now I'm not gonna be ready

1555
01:07:25.88 --> 01:07:31.000
Yeah, it's my fault. Yeah, yeah now if you get in what this is what happens and this is the difference man

1556
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.36
If you have the habit of actually saying like hey, I didn't anticipate this and it's actually my fault

1557
01:07:39.08 --> 01:07:41.08
Then you know what you do you plan better

1558
01:07:41.64 --> 01:07:43.08
Yeah

1559
01:07:43.08 --> 01:07:46.28
How many times have I called you up and said hey echo not ready to record the podcast?

1560
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.28
Yeah, you times

1561
01:07:48.52 --> 01:07:52.68
No, actually no you said I might not be ready and then

1562
01:07:53.80 --> 01:07:56.04
Right, I got mad at you. Yeah, I got mad

1563
01:07:56.04 --> 01:08:01.000
So and but I I was actually giving you a warning of like hey, I'm gonna be it's gonna be tight

1564
01:08:01.56 --> 01:08:05.96
But I knew I was gonna have to work to try and get it done what I'm saying is

1565
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.92
When you truly say like everything that's happening in my world is my fault

1566
01:08:11.24 --> 01:08:16.68
You don't make excuses anymore up front you yeah, and even if you do you say like hey here's what's going on

1567
01:08:16.68 --> 01:08:21.08
And this is what I'm gonna do to get over them. Yeah, it's a big difference man. It has a huge impact

1568
01:08:21.40 --> 01:08:23.40
When you're saying

1569
01:08:23.40 --> 01:08:28.28
Here's a good one like this is one of them probably the most common thing of anything and of any excuse

1570
01:08:28.60 --> 01:08:29.80
He's I don't have time

1571
01:08:29.80 --> 01:08:33.80
That's the most is there anymore common excuse. I don't have time besides the dog. I don't work right

1572
01:08:34.52 --> 01:08:38.68
I don't not that I know by the way one time the dog literally ate my kids

1573
01:08:38.68 --> 01:08:42.12
I'll work here because I'll chew it up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get you know more

1574
01:08:43.40 --> 01:08:47.56
Keep your do keep your in a dog secure area. Yeah, so there's no eat

1575
01:08:47.56 --> 01:08:53.96
There's no bigger excuse that gets used more common at least for like a long term goal like a like hey. I want to

1576
01:08:54.60 --> 01:08:56.60
You name it yeah, I want to

1577
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.28
You know, but I want to play piano on a play guitar. I want to write a book. I want to

1578
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.24
Just study I want to get my degree all this stuff right anything is just I don't have time

1579
01:09:05.24 --> 01:09:10.52
I want to get shape right I want to run every it's it's all hey even even I want to spend more time with my kids

1580
01:09:10.52 --> 01:09:13.88
But I have time yeah, so that's that's the pre-given excuse

1581
01:09:13.88 --> 01:09:17.48
But when you blame all these other things

1582
01:09:18.44 --> 01:09:23.24
The time that it's not your fault that you don't have time it's the fault of the

1583
01:09:24.44 --> 01:09:32.20
Schedule it's the fault of the weather it's the fault of it's the lack of time the fact of the matters if you take ownership of that

1584
01:09:33.56 --> 01:09:36.04
If you take ownership of the time

1585
01:09:37.08 --> 01:09:38.76
You will have time because you'll make time

1586
01:09:38.76 --> 01:09:42.36
Yeah, and when I call you up and say hey, I might not be able to get ready

1587
01:09:42.36 --> 01:09:48.28
What I'm doing is I'm saying okay, I'm giving him a warning and then I'm looking at my schedule going where can I finish

1588
01:09:48.52 --> 01:09:50.52
Prep it or when I can I prepare for this yeah

1589
01:09:51.72 --> 01:09:54.92
When can I get this done that's the ultimate excuse

1590
01:09:55.96 --> 01:09:58.20
For so many people I don't have time and

1591
01:09:58.52 --> 01:10:02.84
minute you say that you don't have control over the time you do have control over the time

1592
01:10:02.84 --> 01:10:06.60
I guess what hey are there people that are working three jobs?

1593
01:10:06.68 --> 01:10:10.52
Yes, there are and might they have all are just things that they're gonna have to edit out of their schedule

1594
01:10:10.52 --> 01:10:13.96
Yes, there are one of the first things you should edit out of your schedule YouTube

1595
01:10:15.08 --> 01:10:23.48
Social media surfing internet surfing right what else do we do to waste time you don't I mean like we waste time doing fix TV

1596
01:10:25.24 --> 01:10:26.60
So

1597
01:10:26.60 --> 01:10:28.60
If you if you have an excuse

1598
01:10:30.04 --> 01:10:33.64
Turn it back on yourself and take control of it. That's all I'm saying

1599
01:10:34.20 --> 01:10:37.40
We got you make the time you make the time

1600
01:10:37.40 --> 01:10:42.92
Yeah, a little sight time saving element. I don't even know if it's a tip

1601
01:10:42.92 --> 01:10:48.60
It's just a little thing to consider when you cruise cruise extra hard so you can get it done in half the time

1602
01:10:50.20 --> 01:10:53.88
I'm disciplined with my time so I can cruise yeah, sometimes

1603
01:10:55.24 --> 01:10:58.76
Just funny equals cruising. Yes, that's the freedom part of cruising

1604
01:10:59.64 --> 01:11:06.28
The time is like a it can be kind of like a balloon you know with like little leaks in it where you know you want

1605
01:11:06.28 --> 01:11:11.000
Like like time will just kind of leak away right so if you're not you know like it

1606
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.80
Thank you I think you were the one who kind of told me where you're like you should you should like plan kind of everything

1607
01:11:15.80 --> 01:11:21.16
You got to go just plan it all and get it done and then the rest of that time is all is yeah, you're a type and free

1608
01:11:21.16 --> 01:11:23.40
Yeah, so if you're like okay

1609
01:11:23.40 --> 01:11:28.52
I have stuff to do today, but I'm not gonna plan it necessarily I'm just gonna sort of get it done tomorrow at some point

1610
01:11:29.56 --> 01:11:36.04
You could get one thing done you could just be you know messing around of whatever and then you get another thing done and you kind of like dang that took me

1611
01:11:36.04 --> 01:11:38.68
Kind of all day a lot of times. So you know especially you have like three four things

1612
01:11:38.84 --> 01:11:43.32
But all those like little in between times if you can add them all up, but sure

1613
01:11:43.32 --> 01:11:47.56
Okay, a workout takes let's say you really want to go hard and say I want to work on for an hour and a half every day

1614
01:11:47.56 --> 01:11:52.36
But I don't really have a free hour and a half in a row right because I got to go pick up my kids

1615
01:11:52.36 --> 01:11:54.76
I didn't got to go do this I got to drop them all how you do all this stuff

1616
01:11:55.16 --> 01:11:56.68
But if

1617
01:11:56.68 --> 01:12:00.78
Most of the time if you're like okay, I'm gonna schedule all these things and I'm gonna boom boom again

1618
01:12:00.78 --> 01:12:08.38
All done then it's almost like you're shifting your time so it doesn't just leak through the little things that you have to do when you allow it to

1619
01:12:08.38 --> 01:12:14.46
I think it was you that originally talked about this how much work people get done before like vacation

1620
01:12:14.78 --> 01:12:16.78
Like they know what are going on vacation

1621
01:12:16.78 --> 01:12:20.70
I don't know what everything done do that every day. Yes, you have more free time

1622
01:12:21.02 --> 01:12:23.50
Yeah, just even like when you're leaving

1623
01:12:23.82 --> 01:12:25.98
Hit this sort of follow me. I did this the other day

1624
01:12:25.98 --> 01:12:30.22
I went I actually went to 24 our fitness got a good workout by the way

1625
01:12:31.98 --> 01:12:37.18
So I went to an apartment with got my workout or whatever came out came in my truck. I was checking

1626
01:12:37.90 --> 01:12:44.54
Checking the crypto stuff, but so I got my truck checked it and I was checking it and then I like checks some other alerts

1627
01:12:44.54 --> 01:12:45.42
You know

1628
01:12:45.42 --> 01:12:50.46
You check it and boom boom and then I and then I left so I remember when I put my phone down and I

1629
01:12:50.46 --> 01:12:54.54
Started it up and I left I kind of looked over and you could see the window of 24 fitness and you know

1630
01:12:54.54 --> 01:12:58.70
Like people that work at the front desk are there so I for whatever reason I'm thinking to myself

1631
01:12:58.70 --> 01:13:04.22
I wonder if they were watching me like oh another person it take to do his phone and they're kind of just had that thought, you know

1632
01:13:04.22 --> 01:13:06.22
That I thought about how to wait

1633
01:13:06.46 --> 01:13:12.38
There that was like a good maybe 10 minutes. Oh, yeah that I just like let leak away right there

1634
01:13:12.38 --> 01:13:16.06
Hey, if that was part of my schedule if I needed to check these things for sure

1635
01:13:16.06 --> 01:13:19.26
I could have like if that was on some sort of a schedule or if I

1636
01:13:19.74 --> 01:13:22.22
If I chose to do that at a specific time

1637
01:13:22.22 --> 01:13:30.30
I would have got that 10 minutes back somehow like that 10 minutes when the leak to it no I actually by the time I was left the gym

1638
01:13:31.42 --> 01:13:37.18
At that particular kind of time if I didn't let that 10 minutes I would have been home already doing other stuff that I should have schedules

1639
01:13:37.50 --> 01:13:42.94
Yeah work doing it. Yeah exactly right and we do that all day that kind of stuff don't let you talk

1640
01:13:43.66 --> 01:13:49.10
But another thing we're another time or another situation where this works what you're saying about this

1641
01:13:49.10 --> 01:13:52.54
Taking ownership in for real take ownership. Yeah, don't be like hey

1642
01:13:53.02 --> 01:13:56.86
You know, you know, it's my fault then this is your phone. Be like oh, what is there?

1643
01:13:56.86 --> 01:14:02.94
What kind of thing? I'm not saying he said that but I'm saying that can is apologizing when you apologize to someone you know

1644
01:14:02.94 --> 01:14:06.54
Like someone's like hey, hey look look mean you had a disagreement

1645
01:14:06.86 --> 01:14:12.62
escalated whatever then the next time like hey man. I'm sorry, you know, but but you did kind of say something

1646
01:14:12.62 --> 01:14:16.86
You know, but I am sorry, you know, kind of thing. You know, yeah, right so you're putting a button there

1647
01:14:16.86 --> 01:14:25.34
Yeah, you're putting this at it's not real sort of true apology. It's not effective at all like you yeah or if you explain like but I was just feeling this or you know

1648
01:14:25.66 --> 01:14:32.38
It's just you know any time there's not like a full on 100% full speed apology towards someone like don't mention

1649
01:14:32.54 --> 01:14:38.30
The reasons why you felt that way don't mention you kind of justification on why you went there with your mind

1650
01:14:38.30 --> 01:14:43.32
Whatever it's all just like this what it did this all like terrible and whatever and I'm straight up sorry

1651
01:14:43.66 --> 01:14:45.66
That's so effective

1652
01:14:45.66 --> 01:14:52.86
Yeah, speaking of apologies next question. I'm sorry for taking so long with that and you know, but you were really

1653
01:14:52.86 --> 01:14:57.98
Eugenia I'm just saying next question jocco the military taught me to never apologize

1654
01:14:58.78 --> 01:15:01.42
Speaking of it because it's a sign of weakness

1655
01:15:01.98 --> 01:15:07.02
Had a conversation with a coworker who says that extreme ownership is the same as apologizing

1656
01:15:08.22 --> 01:15:10.22
so first of all no

1657
01:15:10.22 --> 01:15:15.58
Apologizing is actually not a sign of weakness and whoever

1658
01:15:16.78 --> 01:15:26.54
Was putting that out whoever taught that was actually to insecure about themselves and their leadership capability to admit when they were wrong or made a mistake

1659
01:15:27.42 --> 01:15:31.18
And and really insecure about a lot of other things most likely

1660
01:15:32.22 --> 01:15:36.78
People it's actually the opposite people that can't admit their mistakes are weak

1661
01:15:36.78 --> 01:15:39.82
Mm-hmm and

1662
01:15:39.82 --> 01:15:44.06
People that can't apologize when they screw up our weak. They're scared

1663
01:15:45.02 --> 01:15:47.74
They're scared to take ownership and they're protective of their ego

1664
01:15:49.82 --> 01:15:51.82
Now that being said

1665
01:15:52.14 --> 01:15:56.46
Extreme ownership is not the same as apologizing, but they're definitely similar

1666
01:15:57.42 --> 01:16:01.26
You know extreme ownership means you're admitting that there's some kind of a problem and you're taking ownership of that problem

1667
01:16:01.98 --> 01:16:05.18
If it's something that you did wrong then you're you're taking ownership of that mistake

1668
01:16:05.18 --> 01:16:08.78
The key part as you already said is not that you're just

1669
01:16:09.42 --> 01:16:12.22
Oaning the problem you're actually solving the problem

1670
01:16:15.74 --> 01:16:22.54
And yeah if you screw something up or you make a mistake then apologize for it apologize for your shortfalls

1671
01:16:23.42 --> 01:16:25.42
And then you can move forward

1672
01:16:25.42 --> 01:16:29.82
Sarah Armstrong she's said a couple times on Twitter when I've said like yeah, so you're sorry

1673
01:16:30.54 --> 01:16:32.54
She said ask for forgiveness too

1674
01:16:32.54 --> 01:16:34.54
I

1675
01:16:34.54 --> 01:16:39.66
Haven't tried that one out, but she seems to seem to think that that is another and you when she says things

1676
01:16:39.66 --> 01:16:44.70
I listen to her she's yeah, I have a smart I think we talked about that. I think it might have been Sarah Armstrong

1677
01:16:45.10 --> 01:16:46.46
Oh wait, she said that long time ago

1678
01:16:46.46 --> 01:16:47.10
All along

1679
01:16:47.10 --> 01:16:50.14
Okay, yeah, you see we talked about this before and there's my take on now

1680
01:16:50.70 --> 01:16:52.70
Say it again

1681
01:16:52.70 --> 01:16:54.70
I'm not 100% on that one

1682
01:16:54.70 --> 01:16:56.94
Like ask for forgiveness this is why yeah, yeah, I will

1683
01:16:56.94 --> 01:17:03.90
Because it's this if someone I dig it as far as like doing it it feels like it does feel like like a humble kind of approach

1684
01:17:03.90 --> 01:17:06.86
But it can be taken like this so I would take it

1685
01:17:07.90 --> 01:17:11.02
And I don't think I'd be wrong. Let's do the time where when it's like

1686
01:17:11.66 --> 01:17:20.86
Okay, I'm I'm sorry, you know, I'm I messed up. It's all me whatever right so it's almost like you throw the ball in their court

1687
01:17:21.90 --> 01:17:23.66
To be the bad guy

1688
01:17:23.66 --> 01:17:29.26
It's kind of like so it's almost like a guaranteed way to get forgiven. That's what it is and it's kind of like I know that

1689
01:17:29.50 --> 01:17:34.38
So it's like this is me strong-larming forgiveness from you. It's like shaming you in their forgiveness

1690
01:17:34.38 --> 01:17:37.98
So you're saying if you're like if I say hey, I'm really sorry about this

1691
01:17:38.62 --> 01:17:40.62
Do you forgive me yeah

1692
01:17:41.18 --> 01:17:43.18
I gotta say yes

1693
01:17:43.18 --> 01:17:44.62
I'm

1694
01:17:44.62 --> 01:17:46.46
Posing on posing strong-larming

1695
01:17:47.74 --> 01:17:51.58
It's it's it's it gets in feed. I'm sure Sarah will give us some feedback. Yeah. It's subtle, but um

1696
01:17:51.58 --> 01:17:56.94
And I'm saying really they it's more prevalent. I don't think of ever asked for a person's forgiveness

1697
01:17:56.94 --> 01:18:01.18
I've said the I've said so you know, sorry apologize for all kinds of stupid things that have done

1698
01:18:01.18 --> 01:18:03.98
But I don't think I've ever asked for forgiveness

1699
01:18:04.30 --> 01:18:06.30
Maybe if this was something really big

1700
01:18:07.10 --> 01:18:12.46
Yeah, but even then man. Yeah, that's a tough one. I am sure she has a little great reason behind it

1701
01:18:12.46 --> 01:18:13.66
Well, I have to get further

1702
01:18:14.06 --> 01:18:16.06
Explanations yeah

1703
01:18:16.06 --> 01:18:20.70
I thought of that because I considered like saying that in some minor

1704
01:18:20.70 --> 01:18:22.70
Situation whatever and then I'm like wait

1705
01:18:22.70 --> 01:18:26.94
In minor situations it's too much. Yeah, like you know, I call I show to play man

1706
01:18:26.94 --> 01:18:29.42
I'm sorry will you forgive me like no

1707
01:18:30.22 --> 01:18:32.46
Like that's this is a little too much. It's like saying

1708
01:18:33.42 --> 01:18:35.82
Hey, I know I you know, I know I made you bad or something like that

1709
01:18:35.82 --> 01:18:39.10
I know I made you mad and I'm sorry you know whatever are you still mad?

1710
01:18:39.74 --> 01:18:43.26
It's kind of like that because if you say yeah, I'm still mad. It's kind of like

1711
01:18:43.26 --> 01:18:48.62
Right hey, I said my piece you chose not to be met or you chose to continue to be mad

1712
01:18:48.62 --> 01:18:55.34
That's your problem kind of thing. It's like do you please forgive me please forgive me like what kind of a

1713
01:18:55.90 --> 01:18:58.22
Dick doesn't forgive someone you know

1714
01:18:58.62 --> 01:19:02.94
It's kind of like that and then they're bringing that so it's like a little strong. Okay, I said we'll get feedback

1715
01:19:02.94 --> 01:19:06.62
It's an interesting we'll get feedback from Sarah. I'm sure it's interesting

1716
01:19:07.58 --> 01:19:11.18
To think that there's people out there and you know that out there that I hate don't apologize

1717
01:19:11.18 --> 01:19:14.14
It's decided we could just yeah, just just being dumb

1718
01:19:15.10 --> 01:19:16.46
Yeah, I don't do it

1719
01:19:16.46 --> 01:19:21.34
Yeah, here's here's the advice for today. Don't be dumb. Yeah, it's kind of goes the the

1720
01:19:21.34 --> 01:19:23.90
The apologizing and taking extreme more ownership

1721
01:19:23.90 --> 01:19:26.38
I say not similar. I think there's a pickover left there. Oh

1722
01:19:26.54 --> 01:19:30.78
This huge I didn't say they were not similar. Oh, no, no, not that not the same thing. Sorry

1723
01:19:30.78 --> 01:19:33.90
Yeah, they're not they're not the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1724
01:19:34.14 --> 01:19:39.02
Yeah, it's like um we'll back to the thing when you're like yeah, if you don't apologize that's weaker

1725
01:19:39.02 --> 01:19:41.74
Whatever that's kind of like the guy who says like hey

1726
01:19:41.74 --> 01:19:45.34
This is how I am taking it or leave it kind of thing like if they're you know like those people

1727
01:19:45.34 --> 01:19:48.70
Yeah, I mean if they're a dick you know or something like that and they'll like take it or leave it

1728
01:19:48.70 --> 01:19:53.34
Some people love me some people hate me. It's kind of thing and brother. I don't bother you that people hate you because of how you are

1729
01:19:53.34 --> 01:19:55.90
You know kind of thing. It's gonna be cater. Yeah, you know

1730
01:19:56.38 --> 01:20:03.18
So it's kind of weird. I mean yeah, I take it. You know be you for sure, but um I think that's something. It's not nothing if people hate you

1731
01:20:04.06 --> 01:20:06.06
Do one more question

1732
01:20:06.62 --> 01:20:08.62
As a person in a leadership position

1733
01:20:08.62 --> 01:20:16.22
What should I do if I consistently notice one of my guys motivating the team and leading them successfully

1734
01:20:16.78 --> 01:20:18.78
During Projects and missions better than I can

1735
01:20:19.42 --> 01:20:25.74
The completion of the mission being the top priority would it be better for me to back down and let my counterpart lead

1736
01:20:26.46 --> 01:20:28.46
Which will benefit the company and its employees

1737
01:20:29.90 --> 01:20:32.54
And how will I regain my status among them?

1738
01:20:32.54 --> 01:20:40.06
I think this is actually pretty straightforward if you've got someone that's doing a better job leading then

1739
01:20:40.38 --> 01:20:48.78
Let him lead let him lead give him some room learn from them support them the best you can and the best way you can most likely support them is by getting out of the way

1740
01:20:49.10 --> 01:20:55.90
And letting them do what they're doing and then get them the support that they need and what this is going to give you

1741
01:20:56.70 --> 01:20:59.66
The benefit of is now you can instead of looking

1742
01:20:59.66 --> 01:21:07.58
Down and in and managing your team you can look up and out and forward and see what is going on in the future and

1743
01:21:07.82 --> 01:21:15.66
Prep the battlefield and in the future or prep the next market area or look for recruiting or you can move you can lead you can actually lead

1744
01:21:17.42 --> 01:21:18.62
And

1745
01:21:18.62 --> 01:21:20.62
Let that you know

1746
01:21:20.62 --> 01:21:24.62
Young buck handle the things that are going on tack pre gone about for right now

1747
01:21:24.62 --> 01:21:32.46
You just say this to the to the seal leadership. I used to say hey the enlisted seal leaders handle the problem that is in their face right now

1748
01:21:32.46 --> 01:21:36.62
The tackle problems in their face right now the officer should be looking at what we're going to do next

1749
01:21:37.42 --> 01:21:42.70
That's kind of an e really simple. It's not always like that, but that's a real good starting point

1750
01:21:43.42 --> 01:21:47.50
And so in this position, I'd be like oh I got a young buck that's coming up and leading well cool

1751
01:21:47.50 --> 01:21:49.50
That's going to allow me allow me

1752
01:21:50.86 --> 01:21:53.50
to look up and out and be ready to move forward and

1753
01:21:53.50 --> 01:21:59.26
Plan the next move now as far as regaining your status as leader you won't really need to

1754
01:22:00.30 --> 01:22:01.98
Because

1755
01:22:01.98 --> 01:22:11.10
If you do this properly you'll be seen as a leader who is confident enough to let a subordinate leader step up and lead while I go and move forward

1756
01:22:12.94 --> 01:22:19.50
The we you'd have to regain if you were there shutting this person down and trying to micro manage and doing a worst job

1757
01:22:19.50 --> 01:22:21.50
Then everyone on the team knows that that guy could do a good job

1758
01:22:21.50 --> 01:22:23.50
Hmm, let him do it

1759
01:22:25.82 --> 01:22:34.86
That's about confidence really it's about like do you have are you confident and are you secure in your leadership?

1760
01:22:34.86 --> 01:22:36.86
Oh, yeah to step aside

1761
01:22:38.86 --> 01:22:42.62
Love it hey you're really good at this cool you stepping there and do it. I don't know problem

1762
01:22:43.34 --> 01:22:45.18
Well you get the occasional person that's like oh

1763
01:22:46.22 --> 01:22:49.02
Look, Jocelyn's joc was that that guy do it because he doesn't know what he's doing

1764
01:22:49.02 --> 01:22:54.62
Okay, so yeah one out of 20 people will be that big Mr. negative. That's fine. Yeah, you know

1765
01:22:54.78 --> 01:23:00.62
Then then what's cool is when you're on the outside guess what you are when you're when you let someone else run the team guess what you have

1766
01:23:01.26 --> 01:23:02.54
Guess what you have?

1767
01:23:02.54 --> 01:23:04.54
Yes, oh I go Charles

1768
01:23:04.54 --> 01:23:08.46
Yes, you have detachment and so now you're gonna be able to see things that even that

1769
01:23:08.70 --> 01:23:14.06
Bleed or that's better than you can't see and then when you come in you're gonna look like the tactical genius because you point something out

1770
01:23:14.06 --> 01:23:16.06
But they didn't notice because they were in the firefight

1771
01:23:16.06 --> 01:23:18.06
That's a good genius

1772
01:23:18.06 --> 01:23:23.82
Works things get it. Yeah, that's hard to do that man. What's going to do in better than you?

1773
01:23:23.82 --> 01:23:28.54
You know, oh man. Yeah, that's right. I mean the O high state tape what takes confidence

1774
01:23:28.54 --> 01:23:31.18
What you said this is that's such a good example of

1775
01:23:31.82 --> 01:23:36.22
Keeping your ego in check because what you just said everything feels that and when you feel that that's when you got all cool

1776
01:23:36.46 --> 01:23:40.94
My ego is getting out of control. It's fine. Just put it in check and let this person bleed and I'll move

1777
01:23:41.26 --> 01:23:44.14
You know check out what we're gonna do next. I'll look ahead on the battlefield

1778
01:23:44.14 --> 01:23:49.26
Should I I'm trying to think like huh, oh you said they're occasionally there'll be a guy

1779
01:23:49.26 --> 01:23:51.74
It would be like oh he doesn't always doing so he's letting do all right

1780
01:23:52.06 --> 01:23:56.14
I've been in that situation where my boss actually I've been the guy who

1781
01:23:57.42 --> 01:24:03.34
My supervisor like said oh yeah, you like you handle you take this, you know you got this one kind of thing

1782
01:24:03.34 --> 01:24:06.46
And I'm like yeah, you're doing it because you don't know what you're doing kind of thing and everyone knew that

1783
01:24:07.02 --> 01:24:11.18
And so I've been in that situation where I'm looking at them, but now think about this

1784
01:24:11.18 --> 01:24:15.98
Think about if instead of him just saying hey you go on run this thing think if we were to say hey echo

1785
01:24:16.70 --> 01:24:20.46
You're really good at this you're better than I am you step up run this

1786
01:24:20.46 --> 01:24:23.42
I'll be over here looking where we're next. What would you think then yeah?

1787
01:24:23.42 --> 01:24:28.78
So he's actually said that before like a couple times and every single time it made me if you way better like

1788
01:24:30.06 --> 01:24:37.10
Even the I mean of course the truth will set you free. Yeah, so I feel like if I was one of the

1789
01:24:37.10 --> 01:24:41.82
Don't like you don't want one of the team guys on the teams thinking that I think I wouldn't think that if yeah

1790
01:24:41.82 --> 01:24:45.82
If he did that kind of stuff and the or if or if as long as he didn't act like

1791
01:24:46.94 --> 01:24:53.50
This is the counter to the heart of leadership the count this whole executive you think that if you hide it

1792
01:24:53.50 --> 01:24:58.06
Yeah, it's better and the better thing to do is be like hey echo is really good at this

1793
01:24:58.06 --> 01:25:01.50
He's better than I am and he's gonna step up around this thing and people are like oh

1794
01:25:01.50 --> 01:25:07.10
I'll chuck a super confident leadership they don't they don't verbalize in their head that but they let's just the feeling that

1795
01:25:08.62 --> 01:25:12.22
That juxtapes talk about his and caroos run in this thing. He's just yeah, we're good

1796
01:25:12.78 --> 01:25:19.26
Good man. Yeah, so watch out for that. Remember though. Just keep your ego check. Yes, sir at all times

1797
01:25:19.82 --> 01:25:21.18
All right

1798
01:25:21.18 --> 01:25:24.86
Let's have a podcast that's less than nineteen hours long

1799
01:25:26.54 --> 01:25:28.54
so

1800
01:25:28.54 --> 01:25:34.70
How can you maybe give us a hand with helping be prepared and

1801
01:25:35.34 --> 01:25:41.58
Getting better in our lives. True Charles go. You have a deal no problem. Okay, so we're working out. We're all working out

1802
01:25:42.46 --> 01:25:49.18
Yes, 100% right every day. Are we working out every day? So you don't have to not necessarily have to but a lot will say I recommend it

1803
01:25:49.18 --> 01:25:54.78
Yeah, we're not working out in the cruising for a month. So we're all working out look we're gonna supplement our stuff

1804
01:25:54.78 --> 01:25:58.30
Jockel does have supplements now that was kind of the plan

1805
01:25:59.50 --> 01:26:01.50
The plan has come to fruition

1806
01:26:02.86 --> 01:26:08.86
That's the word right fruition. It is yeah, so I'm used it correctly. Yeah, see all right there you go

1807
01:26:09.34 --> 01:26:14.14
So cruel oil right that's the the main one for our joints actually it's good for your eyes in brain too

1808
01:26:14.14 --> 01:26:16.14
by the way so

1809
01:26:16.86 --> 01:26:21.66
Worried I'm not saying don't worry about your eyesight anymore after you take this. I'm saying you can worry less

1810
01:26:21.66 --> 01:26:29.58
Tell you that that's good. So yeah, Jockel super cruel is what it's called and joint warfare that one's obviously for the joint

1811
01:26:29.74 --> 01:26:34.86
Specifically, but I'm sure that's all kind of the bad of it. I've noticed my I have an injured arm

1812
01:26:35.42 --> 01:26:37.42
Healing up

1813
01:26:37.42 --> 01:26:46.38
quickly. Yeah, like not like noticeably each day and I have to attribute because I've had this similar injuries before right it's an arm lock right

1814
01:26:46.38 --> 01:26:51.58
Yeah, and as bad as this one was yeah little noises

1815
01:26:53.02 --> 01:26:59.18
It is noticeably I'm attributing that to joint warfare. Yeah, and Dean told the other day

1816
01:26:59.74 --> 01:27:05.98
Dean told me exactly like like his version of what happened and I know that I know that move

1817
01:27:05.98 --> 01:27:12.06
That shows and like even when he shows it on me yeah, Dean's one of these guys where I think sometimes he doesn't know his own control

1818
01:27:12.06 --> 01:27:22.14
And what he's doing is super effective by the way. It's like it's a Kimura. That's what he's doing. It's like the one the what he did to me was a straight arm lock

1819
01:27:22.14 --> 01:27:25.98
Yeah, so that's what it ends up being just so everyone knows how to make this real clear

1820
01:27:26.14 --> 01:27:28.14
This was an accident

1821
01:27:28.86 --> 01:27:34.14
Dean was actually showing a move. He wasn't even we weren't rolling it wasn't live

1822
01:27:34.14 --> 01:27:36.14
He was showing a move and

1823
01:27:36.14 --> 01:27:43.90
He's shown 10,000 moves with me as the dummy and I'm showing many many moves on Dean with Dean is the dummy

1824
01:27:44.46 --> 01:27:47.74
And he got this position. I had just arrived

1825
01:27:48.62 --> 01:27:52.46
And I don't know if that makes it worse or not, but I was definitely what's called you know

1826
01:27:52.54 --> 01:27:53.74
So I was cold and

1827
01:27:54.38 --> 01:27:57.82
No warm up and he was showing a move. So he's just I want to show this thing

1828
01:27:57.82 --> 01:28:01.90
I think he's like you know, Jock was got a good defense here, so you gotta be ready if the guy does this

1829
01:28:01.90 --> 01:28:09.10
And then he's like as he was saying that I think he thought I was going to attempt this movement and I didn't and he just

1830
01:28:09.10 --> 01:28:11.90
He just and he'd meet in the arm

1831
01:28:12.38 --> 01:28:14.38
So is that pretty much how he de-reefed it to you?

1832
01:28:14.38 --> 01:28:18.78
Uh, yeah, but the thing the reason I understood it because more second-

1833
01:28:18.78 --> 01:28:21.98
Yes guy, you know, he feels bad no, and you know, I mean it's it's a bummer

1834
01:28:22.62 --> 01:28:25.98
Yeah, but I know I know for a fact

1835
01:28:25.98 --> 01:28:31.58
He didn't mean to do it. Whatever. Yeah, it's one of it's basically how he explained it and he's done this

1836
01:28:31.58 --> 01:28:33.58
Like I said as me as the dummy

1837
01:28:33.82 --> 01:28:39.34
And it hurts by the way, you know, it's like money. He goes he goes I didn't realize you weren't that flexible

1838
01:28:39.34 --> 01:28:41.34
I go bro. It's my elbow

1839
01:28:41.34 --> 01:28:43.82
It's no flexibility in it elbow

1840
01:28:44.06 --> 01:28:47.26
Well, it must have been a miscommunication just like I said because this is what it was

1841
01:28:47.26 --> 01:28:49.74
It's like okay when you go out for the camera from across sight

1842
01:28:49.74 --> 01:28:54.30
And the guy streams is arm you want to get his arm behind his back bend his arm basically in behind his back

1843
01:28:54.30 --> 01:28:58.30
That's what he said and that's the move he's had shown to me before and it's one of his things his tricks

1844
01:28:58.30 --> 01:29:01.34
And he he said that like when he did it

1845
01:29:02.62 --> 01:29:06.94
He's just like a miscommunity, you know like if you and if you do it it's kind of like you're just

1846
01:29:07.26 --> 01:29:10.38
It's just leverage to bend your arm behind your back, but

1847
01:29:10.62 --> 01:29:14.62
Dang and it wasn't your shoulder them jam no no no and I'm thankful about that

1848
01:29:14.94 --> 01:29:20.46
shoulder injuries are worse than elbow elbows like they heal you know and even this one I can do like I'm

1849
01:29:20.46 --> 01:29:26.70
It'll be fine. Yeah, no factor. Yeah, you got the joint warfare. Yeah, I tribute the quick healing

1850
01:29:28.22 --> 01:29:36.38
To join warfare. Krilowail which I always take but don't warfare. Yeah, and this and these are one of those ones that is kind of like man

1851
01:29:37.90 --> 01:29:42.46
I wish I would it it would have saved me a lot of pain in the past now, you know like if you're joined

1852
01:29:42.46 --> 01:29:48.06
So just holding them. Yeah, it's more of a big deal. It's good and it's like I said I mean I had my shoulder

1853
01:29:48.06 --> 01:29:53.74
Where I couldn't do muscle ups for like six months and then when we came out with the first like experimental

1854
01:29:53.74 --> 01:29:55.74
No like the second experimental

1855
01:29:56.14 --> 01:29:58.94
joint warfare and I was on it was like

1856
01:29:59.58 --> 01:30:03.90
All of a sudden I was doing muscle ups again. Yeah, which is that's awesome, right? That's awesome

1857
01:30:05.18 --> 01:30:11.66
Doing muscle ups period is awesome because I haven't been staying muscle ups. I haven't done muscle ups for decades really

1858
01:30:13.26 --> 01:30:17.42
I don't think of every time I'm a muscle up before in four decades. I think I've tried to do muscle up

1859
01:30:17.42 --> 01:30:22.14
Probably like three times we'll go. We'll do some muscle ups. Yeah, teach me the technique. It's just technique well

1860
01:30:22.14 --> 01:30:26.06
There's technique you're just a little bit of strength obviously, yeah, but if you know the false grip

1861
01:30:26.46 --> 01:30:30.54
Which is this main the main technique that needs to be learned keep it in tight to your chest

1862
01:30:31.34 --> 01:30:33.34
Pull it to your sternum boom

1863
01:30:33.74 --> 01:30:37.10
Throw your chest forward in your there. All right cool. Just do skill

1864
01:30:37.58 --> 01:30:39.34
muscle up, but yeah, if you want this

1865
01:30:39.82 --> 01:30:43.98
Don't work for and jocco superkril. It is at origin main.com

1866
01:30:43.98 --> 01:30:50.78
Main like the state origin main.com also an origin main is where you can get your geese

1867
01:30:51.34 --> 01:30:57.26
But before the geese and this is new so I can't this new supplement called the discipline

1868
01:30:57.66 --> 01:31:00.06
pre mission pre workout pre

1869
01:31:00.94 --> 01:31:03.98
Life activity pre life supplement

1870
01:31:05.02 --> 01:31:08.70
That's a good on cognitive enhancements in there as well as physical

1871
01:31:08.70 --> 01:31:15.10
Pre mission yeah, you're gonna need your brain and your body yeah boom for the mission boom

1872
01:31:15.10 --> 01:31:20.94
That's the one to take yeah get down. No, it's good by the way tastes good too. Surprisingly jocco actually made it tastes good

1873
01:31:20.94 --> 01:31:27.90
Yeah, well because the big thing you got to watch out for is you know we don't want to spike our insulin level with sugar

1874
01:31:28.62 --> 01:31:30.62
Yeah, but we have monk fruit

1875
01:31:31.98 --> 01:31:35.74
which is the sweetener and and

1876
01:31:35.74 --> 01:31:39.58
monk fruit taste good

1877
01:31:40.22 --> 01:31:48.06
Delish and and it also has a slim sum of positive impact on your physiology as well. So double two

1878
01:31:48.46 --> 01:31:50.46
We say there we say two birds one stone

1879
01:31:50.46 --> 01:31:52.46
That's what we say

1880
01:31:52.46 --> 01:31:54.46
on yeah

1881
01:31:54.46 --> 01:31:59.50
Those days good. Yeah, let me find flavor. Yeah, there you go get down

1882
01:31:59.50 --> 01:32:01.50
But yeah that one do origin main.com

1883
01:32:01.50 --> 01:32:08.30
Real good also an origin main like I was gonna say is geese for all the people who have been asked in Dave Burke today called me today

1884
01:32:08.86 --> 01:32:10.46
About geese like what up with the geese

1885
01:32:10.46 --> 01:32:13.50
I mean my gear and all this stuff you've been doing no wait was even question

1886
01:32:14.54 --> 01:32:19.90
He was actually asking more oh, yeah, he did he was like what geese should I get but then I was like

1887
01:32:19.90 --> 01:32:21.82
Well, okay, okay

1888
01:32:21.82 --> 01:32:23.82
No, no, I know that

1889
01:32:23.82 --> 01:32:29.18
My size is because the chef's paper the traditional geese sizes just like a 1803 boom

1890
01:32:29.18 --> 01:32:34.42
You get it boom. This one is kind of it's more suited for you. Yeah, yeah, he's a skinny

1891
01:32:39.34 --> 01:32:44.54
I got a picture I got a post this picture. I got a picture of Dave Burke and me the commander

1892
01:32:44.86 --> 01:32:49.66
Is oh I'm the commander of TU bruiser. He's the commander of lightning six his

1893
01:32:49.66 --> 01:32:58.30
Anglico team and I got a picture of us in Ramadi together on a rooftop and we're both asleep

1894
01:33:00.38 --> 01:33:04.94
I don't even know what it was taken, but it's pretty awesome and it shows you like

1895
01:33:05.98 --> 01:33:09.82
Like you know what's your awesome is like we're both asleep we both have all of our gear on sitting

1896
01:33:09.82 --> 01:33:14.38
And so I don't a rooftop asleep. So what is that like you just gonna get a catcher

1897
01:33:15.26 --> 01:33:18.54
Sleep when you can yeah, let me just catch this quick. Yeah, probably

1898
01:33:18.54 --> 01:33:23.34
We my guess is we had moved into a position we'd stay there

1899
01:33:23.58 --> 01:33:29.18
We could a clearance was going on the clearance was done and now we were kind of in a

1900
01:33:29.58 --> 01:33:34.94
Stand-by situation and we're just like now we get a chance sleep because before we'd go in the field

1901
01:33:34.94 --> 01:33:37.98
You'd be a wake for basically like

1902
01:33:38.46 --> 01:33:40.94
24 hours and then you go in the field

1903
01:33:41.26 --> 01:33:45.18
Matter of fact sometimes it's like when you got in the field is when you got your first sleep like after you get in the field

1904
01:33:45.18 --> 01:33:49.82
And then you get your four hour or whatever three hours someone you know you get your head down and you get some sleep finally

1905
01:33:50.46 --> 01:33:52.46
And so there's me in Dave Burke

1906
01:33:52.46 --> 01:33:53.46
Racked out

1907
01:33:53.46 --> 01:33:56.70
Oh, and it's not like you're like how you should three for us. I always

1908
01:33:57.26 --> 01:34:02.30
Especially after hearing you guys talk it's like man. It's not like you're coming home from a hard day

1909
01:34:02.78 --> 01:34:06.70
Work and you know now you're you've clocked out and now you have some time to

1910
01:34:07.42 --> 01:34:10.46
Settle down watch the news and go sleep for the night. It's not like that

1911
01:34:10.46 --> 01:34:14.30
You know, you're gonna catch some yeah, you're gonna catch you where you can so dang yeah

1912
01:34:14.30 --> 01:34:15.74
Yeah, it's crazy

1913
01:34:15.74 --> 01:34:18.86
So it's not that you guys are just falling asleep on the job

1914
01:34:22.86 --> 01:34:25.26
What that means is we were probably on the tail end of a

1915
01:34:26.22 --> 01:34:30.22
Operation that we had conducted and we were now like in a stand-down mode and

1916
01:34:30.70 --> 01:34:33.90
Maybe we're probably getting ready to move to another

1917
01:34:34.46 --> 01:34:38.94
You know another quadrant another sector and we were just catching some rack-offs

1918
01:34:39.50 --> 01:34:42.94
But it's an awesome. It's an awesome picture. It tells you how like tired

1919
01:34:42.94 --> 01:34:48.46
You know what we're both sitting in chairs all over gear on holding our guns and we're asleep both of us

1920
01:34:51.02 --> 01:34:55.66

excerpts from this podcast

1957
01:37:14.06 --> 01:37:20.62
The benefits of excerpts. I think are kind of self explanatory and I've explained them plenty times so I'm not gonna do it this time

1958
01:37:21.66 --> 01:37:26.94

Jocco store.com

1962
01:37:37.50 --> 01:37:40.30
This is where you can get the shirts discipline equals freedom a

1963
01:37:41.26 --> 01:37:44.86
shirt with jocco's head on it with a word good

1964
01:37:45.98 --> 01:37:50.38
Written backwards. I'm not gonna say why it's written backwards, but it is written backwards on purpose

1965
01:37:50.94 --> 01:37:54.14
Because people have been emailing you and by the way if you see a shirt with the

1966
01:37:54.14 --> 01:38:00.62
Good written forward. It's a fake shirt. It's a knockoff. It's what's called a counterfeit knockoff

1967
01:38:01.18 --> 01:38:02.46
Bad actually

1968
01:38:02.46 --> 01:38:09.02
Somebody posted a picture of I think I forget what it's it's a jocco some is one of those you know those

1969
01:38:09.58 --> 01:38:11.58
So there's like companies yeah

1970
01:38:11.58 --> 01:38:14.78
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they go you know they form stores on Amazon

1971
01:38:14.78 --> 01:38:17.42
And then you see little something like my

1972
01:38:17.42 --> 01:38:21.66
Pompark or anything and though they they print sure is they're like low quality

1973
01:38:21.66 --> 01:38:37.90
I saw one that said you would never put that quote on there. I don't think you would

1974
01:38:37.90 --> 01:38:39.90
It seems like something you would put

1975
01:38:43.26 --> 01:38:49.98
You know the guy look cool in it and I dig it but good not intention good intention for sure 100%

1976
01:38:49.98 --> 01:38:55.50
And I'm signing on in that way, but I think again, it's a situation where these

1977
01:38:56.06 --> 01:39:01.42
Compat I'm assuming it's a company. I'm sure it's not just one dude, but it's companies they get trendy stuff and they just

1978
01:39:02.30 --> 01:39:04.94
Yeah offer them for print and on

1979
01:39:05.82 --> 01:39:11.42
Amazon or wherever and that's different yeah, that's what they call counterfeit knockoff

1980
01:39:11.90 --> 01:39:16.06
Jocco is the jocco story and then you're definitely supporting the podcast. Yeah talk story.com

1981
01:39:16.06 --> 01:39:21.50
That's it and there's some origin stuff like a back in origin main they got the garage guard. Yeah, you know

1982
01:39:21.50 --> 01:39:27.34
So origin stuff 100% in the game, you know podcast legit other than that it's good

1983
01:39:27.34 --> 01:39:32.14
It's gonna be kind of hard to find oh no the T jocco white T jocco white T

1984
01:39:32.14 --> 01:39:36.94
Supporting the podcast. Yeah, but anything else is gonna be knockoffs and you know kind of find that everyone's in a while

1985
01:39:37.42 --> 01:39:42.38
There'd be where if you care if you care I dig it because to me if if someone was wearing it's a jocco thing

1986
01:39:42.38 --> 01:39:46.46
You would understand they're like hey good evening or something like that I'd be done. I'd be my new friend

1987
01:39:46.46 --> 01:39:52.30
To me yeah, so I dig it 100% either way, but I think that's more just info, you know

1988
01:39:53.02 --> 01:39:55.02
For your information. Yes

1989
01:39:55.02 --> 01:40:00.46

I'm gonna make it like concise. Okay. Here's a good way to say on your path to greatness

2011
01:41:58.30 --> 01:41:59.82
It's a

2012
01:41:59.82 --> 01:42:01.82
Weapon against weakness

2013
01:42:02.22 --> 01:42:06.86
It's kind of concise. I'm so working on it. I just made it up just now concise yet cheesy somehow

2014
01:42:06.86 --> 01:42:11.10
Yeah, yeah, half to greatness that's so cheesy. Don't say it again, bro

2015

Yeah, see see this dude what do you call the creative process? Yeah, this is like no, that was just cheesy

2017
01:42:24.14 --> 01:42:28.78
You're on the path on the path we're working out we're working out we're getting up early some of this most of us some of us

2018
01:42:29.02 --> 01:42:31.02
You know, early

2019
01:42:31.58 --> 01:42:35.02
Sticking with the the dietary guidelines that in keep us in the game

2020
01:42:35.90 --> 01:42:38.78
Hopefully we better be nonetheless

2021
01:42:38.78 --> 01:42:42.70
Everyone everyone's in while you'll hit that little road block little speed bump

2022
01:42:42.70 --> 01:42:48.30
Not road block speed bump moment of weakness all it is is a distraction like can when you get hungry

2023
01:42:48.30 --> 01:42:52.86
You're on a fast or you're on you know like a really solid diet and maybe it's new or something

2024
01:42:54.94 --> 01:42:56.94
You're thinking long-term

2025
01:42:58.22 --> 01:43:05.18
Hopefully you're thinking long-term long-term when my diet's gonna bring me my workout my whole thing is gonna bring me to this long-term goal

2026
01:43:05.58 --> 01:43:11.10
Right you keep your eyes on that goal. You're gonna stand the path you get distracted by the fact that you're hungry

2027
01:43:11.10 --> 01:43:14.30
at one moment the fact that this thing right here

2028
01:43:15.34 --> 01:43:20.86
Don't not whatever taste good you're distracted by that if you keep your eyes on the long-term goal

2029
01:43:20.86 --> 01:43:25.18
You won't be distracted that doesn't mean anything. I know I'm hungry right now so what's we hungry right now? I can eat yeah

2030
01:43:25.82 --> 01:43:28.70
Of course don't let's taste good. They always taste good has nothing to do

2031
01:43:29.98 --> 01:43:31.98
It's not that do with this path

2032
01:43:32.78 --> 01:43:38.62
That's why these are distractions this psychological warfare is it's like a little helper

2033
01:43:38.62 --> 01:43:44.46
To keep you from being distracted and it's jocos telling us

2034
01:43:45.42 --> 01:43:50.06
Why we should not be distracted. All right. Thank you. That was psychological warfare. We're still helping fun

2035
01:43:50.06 --> 01:43:51.42
I do

2036
01:43:51.42 --> 01:43:55.50
It is that's exactly what it is. That's the best way to explain it. You just explain it thoroughly

2037
01:43:55.50 --> 01:43:59.10
I feel like you don't you know why you don't understand the value because you don't listen to it

2038
01:43:59.74 --> 01:44:01.74

2081
01:47:11.66 --> 01:47:13.66
We talked about it a little bit today

2082
01:47:13.66 --> 01:47:16.78
Sure the the monster is a

2083
01:47:17.98 --> 01:47:19.34
Leadership

2084
01:47:19.34 --> 01:47:21.34
Symposium

2085
01:47:21.34 --> 01:47:25.58
Where we talk about leadership. We train leadership pragmatically

2086
01:47:26.70 --> 01:47:28.06
Tools

2087
01:47:28.06 --> 01:47:33.18
You will be you will this is pretty cool you will be a better leader when you come out of the monster you will be

2088
01:47:33.74 --> 01:47:38.94
100% I don't know if you'll be a hundred percent better of leader you will have a hundred percent chance

2089
01:47:38.94 --> 01:47:47.50
or a hundred percent chance of becoming a better leader how much I am not a hundred percent sure on that figure

2090
01:47:48.54 --> 01:47:54.22
But you will definitely be a better leader and when we got done I think I've talked about this before but we got done in Austin

2091
01:47:54.86 --> 01:47:56.38
And we are at GJ2

2092
01:47:56.38 --> 01:47:59.18
Well, you're teaching GJ2 and I was like this is such a good deal

2093
01:48:00.06 --> 01:48:03.66
To get the information that comes at the monster to

2094
01:48:03.66 --> 01:48:11.26
Have that opportunity to learn these lessons from the battlefield that you can then take and apply to your business and your life

2095
01:48:11.98 --> 01:48:17.26
And on top of that like the icing on the cake is is going to GJ2 and getting an introduction to that so

2096
01:48:18.62 --> 01:48:22.70
The monster it's been awesome. It's been awesome to see how it's affected

2097
01:48:23.34 --> 01:48:29.18
People afterwards that have changed their lives from coming to the monster. So it's awesome

2098
01:48:29.18 --> 01:48:34.14
Coming get some at the monster it is this year we're only doing two

2102
01:48:46.78 --> 01:48:51.50
Up until now they all sold out these will sell out

2103
01:48:52.54 --> 01:48:56.38
So if you want to go a lot of times when people when companies

2104
01:48:56.38 --> 01:48:59.10
Companies have bureaucracies inside of them

2105
01:49:00.06 --> 01:49:07.74
And so they're trying to get the approval for the you know, hey, we need eight tickets and they're trying to run that through the chain of command to get the funding for the eight tickets and blah blah blah

2106
01:49:07.74 --> 01:49:13.74
And we've had companies that have started that process too late and then we sell out and we're sitting here saying hey

2107
01:49:14.06 --> 01:49:17.82
Sorry the next monsters in six months you can come then you know what I mean so
