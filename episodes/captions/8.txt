00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000 This is Jocco podcast, number eight, with echo Charles, and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000 Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:28.000 In 1952, a young Marine, Robert A. Ganon, arrived on shore at Injon, Korea, where he was going to be shipped north to fight.
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.000 As they gathered ahead north, he saw stacks of sea bags, which is like a military, duffle bag, and he saw him sitting in the rain.
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000 No one had to explain what they were doing there, why they belonged to Marines that had been killed on the front.
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:04.000 He wrote this poem years later about seeing those sandbags, seeing those sea bags, piled high.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000 When clouds are gray and lowering and fog of scares the plane, I sometimes think I catch a sight of sea bags in the rain.
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000 I know it is a vision to a theo to last, but it brings a whisp of sadness and a haunting of the past.
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000 We had come ashore at Injon in 1952, and in administrative landing, just a unit passing through.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.000 We mustered at the railhead, lining up to board a train, when through the stormy darkness, I saw sea bags in the rain.
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000 There was no need to question why they were lying there, looking lonely and abandoned in the damp Korean air.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:10.000 Their owners had gone northward, and would not return again, from where hells of bitter battle took the lives of fighting men.
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000 Now when fog and darkness gather, I really can't restrain, my sad and thoughts of Injon and sea bags in the rain.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000 So imagine that you're a young Marine who has joined the Marine Corps, and you're fired up, and you have the visions of glory.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000 And that romantic vision in your mind of what war is going to be like, and you get to Korea.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000 And it's an administrative landing, so there's no shooting going on, and you're now you're on the ground, and you're in Korea.
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:58.000 And then you mustered to go north and go to the battlefield, go to the front, and you see these sea bags of all these Marines that have been killed and combat.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:12.000 And you can imagine what that does psychologically to guys, and obviously to Robert A. Ganon, it affects him, affected him as whole life.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:36.000 And he still thinks about it, and as much of a intense experience as that is, the Marine Corps has been walking past those bags, you know, theoretically walking past those bags for over 200 years.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:48.000 And going forward, going into the fray towards the risk, towards in many cases toward death.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000 And I'm kind of leading in with talking about the Marine Corps tonight.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:10.000 Who I have just absolute respect for the United States Marine Corps. We worked closely with them when we were in Ramadi in 2006, mostly with the three eight Marines, which is the third battalion, eighth Marine regimen.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000 And they were there for the bulk of the deployment with us.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:29.000 Then they got relieved by the one six Marines who arrived towards the end of our cruise. And but prior to that, my whole career I was working with Marines. I was did multiple ship board deployments with Marines.
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000 I did a turnover with the first Marsaw Company in Baghdad in 2004. So I know Marines well.
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000 And like I said, they just have my absolute respect. And as a warrior class.
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000 Which is what they are, a warrior class of men and women, their professionalism and their commitment.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000 It is, it's impeccable.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000 And because they fought, you know, in all major wars, they no one understand combat very well.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:17.000 And therefore they know and they understand combat leadership very well.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:28.000 And with that, we are going to look tonight at what used to be called the FMFM 1100.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000 And that was the Fleet Marine Force manual, which is now called the MCWP, the Marine Corps Warfighting Publication 6, 1011.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:55.000 And the title of the document is called Leading Marines.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000 And so what I did is it kind of like I do with most of these books that we look at.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:16.000 I went through it and found the pieces that struck me as highly applicable to combat, which makes them highly applicable to life and to business and to the way we go through this world.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000 So I've pulled some of these ideas out, some quotes out, some sections out to talk about.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000 And discuss. And here we go.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000 Imagine you are riflemen in a company ready to assault a line of enemy machine gun bunkers.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000 You are lying flat on the ground protected for the moment by a slight rise between you and the enemy.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:07:01.000 But just above your head, the enemies guns are throwing a visible and audible curtain of lead, which thuds into the trees around you, causing you to wonder if it makes the same sound when it hits flesh.
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.000 You tell yourself it's impossible, impossible to penetrate that curtain of fire alive.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.000 Yet, in a moment a sergeant's voice will boom, let's go, you can't live forever.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000 But all you hear now is the clatter of machine guns.
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000 The vision of dead and wounded you saw on the way up to the front rises to plague you.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000 Your belly deflates and lies flat against your backbone.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000 And all the gallant thoughts you would hope to have at this moment are gone.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:52.000 You are naked and alone with the instinct of self preservation.
00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000 And that's what soldiers and Marines face, not all of them, but many of them.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000 And they, in these situations, and situations even worse than this, they do decide to go forward.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:20.000 They decide to go forward into that male trauma of fire and of death.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000 And soldiers and warriors have done that for thousands of years.
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000 And you ask yourself, and the purpose that they wrote that paragraph was so that they could ask that question, why?
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 And here's what the Marine Corps says about it.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000 Why do individuals rush forward against their most basic instincts?
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000 Why do Marines take their lives in their hands and lead a charge straight into enemy guns?
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000 In World War II, what was it that made Marines clamber out of their landing clafters?
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000 Landing craft into water of unknown depth and charging to a hail of machine gun and artillery fire, not knowing whether they would ever make it to the beach?
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000 In Vietnam, what was it that made a Marine take the point and start down the dark and misty jungle trail?
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000 At the heart of why Marines are able to put mission accomplishment over concern for their own safety is leadership.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:34.000 Leadership that is the combination of the intangible elements of our ethos and the more tangible elements of our leadership philosophy.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:50.000 So they're saying that this courage comes from the leadership and from the ethos that they live that is brought to the troopers through the leadership, which is a pretty profound statement.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000 It's a very profound statement.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000 And I jumped out of this manual from a moment and I grabbed sort of the Marine Corps principles of leadership.
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:20.000 In other words, here they are justice, judgment, dependability, initiative, decisiveness, tact, integrity, enthusiasm, bearing, unselfishness, courage, knowledge, loyalty, endurance.
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.000 Those are the traits that they talk about and when I actually from that list, I think they're all pretty obvious why they're on that list.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000 The one exception, or I would say the one that stands out to me a little bit as maybe what people wouldn't expect is tact.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:51.000 Yeah, I didn't say tactical or tactics, I said tact and they actually go on to define that a little bit further.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000 The definition of tact is the ability to deal with others in a manner that will maintain good relations and avoid offense.
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:13.000 More simply stated tact is the ability to say and do the right thing at the right time. So obviously, almost every time we sit down at this podcast table and do our work here, we end up somehow talking about the interactions between human beings.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:30.000 And they actually put this as a one of their tenants is that you have to have tact. The quality of consistently treating peers, seniors and subordinates with respect and courtesy is a sign of maturity.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000 Tact allows commands, guidance and opinions to be expressed in a constructive and beneficial manner.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000 For instance, must be extended under all conditions regardless of true feelings.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:57.000 Regardless of true feelings, they are saying you have despite the fact that that person annoys you or that you think you can do a better job or all those things that we talk about regularly here.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000 You have to have tact regardless of your true feelings.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000 Yeah, like you know people, rude people, for example, they'll they'll say stuff.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:20.000 Say stuff like, hey, it was true, you know, they say something that's rude or whatever and they'll be like, hey, I speak the truth if you don't like it kind of that's like lack of tact.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000 That is a public of tact.
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000 I've always thought that we're you always wonder why those people aren't in leadership positions.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000 Yeah, but they don't have tact.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000 Yeah, because who wants to be around somebody that acts like this.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000 And what's interesting about is, you know, one of the other words that they have on your integrity, right? And yet they're saying that, you know, regardless of your true feelings.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000 So there's a little bit of a dichotomy there, you know, and to be the person that says, well, it's true. So I'm just going to say it.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000 Right. No, tact should override integrity in dealing with people and human emotions.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000 Yeah, and that's kind of what I've always thought when I hear people say rude things and be like, oh, it's okay for me to say these kinds of kinds of things because they're true.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000 Even though a lot of times they're just their opinion, but they kind of, it's cloaked in this like presentation that they're just being honest.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000 Yeah, you know, so that yeah, that's interesting how it's, oh, they're saying the tact overrides that quote unquote honesty.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000 Yeah, you know, for the for the sake of leadership or the group or whatever.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000 No doubt about it.
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000 So now as we get into this and what leaders, what leaders are actually leading against.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000 Now, of course, there's an enemy, you're right. There's a force that's opposing you. So you're leading against them, but they have another word that.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000 And the word is friction. And this is something for anybody that knows anything about sort of military science.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000 Understand understands and it's heard the word friction before.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:04.000 And it's a word that comes from Carl Vaughn Klaus, who was a great pressure. General born in 1780 fought in the Ryan campaigns and the Napoleonic wars was a famous military theorist.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:17.000 And he wrote the famous book Vaughn Craig, which means on war. So that was his, that was his sort of masterpiece that he wrote.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000 And it's well read by anybody that's in the military. It has read on war by Klaus Woods.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000 So friction is a term that he coined as far as I know. It's a term that he coined. I haven't read it prior to him.
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000 And so talk about friction. Here's what Klaus Woods says about it.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000 And this is from on war. Then again, I departed from the Marine Corps manual here for a few minutes to go a little bit deeper in friction.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000 Everything is very simple in war, but the simplest thing is difficult.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000 These difficulties accumulate and produce a friction, which no man can imagine exactly who is not seen war.
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:13.000 So in war, through an influence of an infinite of petty circumstances, which cannot properly be described on paper, things disappoint us,
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:28.000 and we fall short of the rank. So this idea of friction is all the little things that build up against you and against what you're trying to accomplish.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:38.000 And I love what he says next. A powerful iron will overcomes this friction. It crushes the obstacles.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000 So your will can overcome them. But there's a buck, there's a caveat. But certainly the machine along with them.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000 So your iron will can smash these obstacles, but it does take a toll on the will.
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000 The strong will of a proud spirit stands prominent and commanding in the middle of the art of war.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000 And we'll get to will a little bit later. But right now we're talking about friction. Activity in war is a movement in a resistant medium.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000 So it's, you know, as opposed to doing stuff on the ground and the air, you're doing it in water or you're doing it in oil.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000 You're doing in something that is slowing you down and stops you.
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:33.000 It is therefore this friction or what is so termed here, which makes that which appears easy and war difficult and reality.
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000 And I will tell you in working with all kinds of companies and businesses, there's friction in every business.
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000 There's friction in everything.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000 Every goal that people have in a business world, there's friction and resistance that's trying to stop you from getting there.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000 And obviously that just slides right over into your life.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000 And those goals that you have and your fighting against this friction and what is this friction.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000 This friction is everything. It's everything that is stopping you from achieving your goal.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000 And in war, it's what the enemy does. It's the weather. It's a lack of ammunition.
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000 It's the, it's the materials that you need that are arriving in time. It's a muddy road.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000 It's a strong, strong wind. It's all these little things.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000 It's the weird attitude of your subordinates. It's the mental capacity of your leadership.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000 It's all these things create this friction that are going to stop you from achieving your goals.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000 Or at least it's going to try to stop you from achieving your goals.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000 And it's the same thing when you get a business that's trying to make something happen.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000 You know, when you go to formulate a business, this is not an easy process.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000 This is a challenging process and there's a friction that just comes up against you.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000 And obviously, like I said with your personal goals, we see friction all the time.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000 Now the Marine Corps, here's their takes. So that was from Crossfits.
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000 And it was a little bit of an abridged version, but you know, I'm abridging.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000 So this one is the Marine Corps.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000 And you'll notice a little bit more clarity because it's written directly in English by Marines.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000 So it's clearer than here's the Marine Corps take on friction.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000 Friction dominates war.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:28.000 It makes simple tasks hard, acts constantly to tear down the will of the individual Marine and interferes with a unit cohesion.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000 It operates across the entire spectrum of conflict from garrison activities to combat,
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000 from senior command elements down to the most forward fighting position.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000 So the friction is everywhere. It's everywhere.
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000 It's on the front line troopers, our feeling friction.
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000 You know, the senior command has friction.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000 That in this day and age, that friction can be loss of connectivity.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000 You know, you're sitting there on the internet when you're trying to communicate with troops that are in the field nowadays.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000 That internet goes down there's friction or your broadband cable gets stuffed up.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000 It's literally that's friction.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000 Everything is friction.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000 Friction can be caused by external factors, such as physical environment,
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000 the nature of the mission or friendly or enemy action.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000 Inadequate or inaccurate intelligence also contributes to friction by causing uncertainty.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000 This uncertainty is sometimes called the fog of war,
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000 where things are not always what the leader expected.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.000 This expression describes both the literal fog created by dust, smoke, and debris on the battlefield.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000 And more importantly, the mental fog of confusion and uncertainty created by lack of knowledge of the enemy,
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000 chaotic noise, mental and physical fatigue and fear.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000 And interestingly,
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000 the first chapter, it's called the fog of war.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000 And it is, and I talk about this fact right here.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000 It was the literal fog of war because it was burning tires in the streets,
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000 creating so it everywhere.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000 And it was concrete dust floating through the air and smoke from machine guns and smoke from smoke grenades.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000 And so there's a literal fog of war where you can't see.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000 And then on top of that, you add the theoretical fog where I didn't know where everyone was.
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000 And I wasn't sure what was happening.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000 And so this fog of war is so very real.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000 Frictions most lethal form.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000 It's most lethal form.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000 However,
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000 is self-induced.
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000 And maybe termed internal friction.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000 So this, again, it's just incredible how these theories of war parallel life.
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.000 And although you have these things that are going on in your world that are trying to stop you from achieving your goals,
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000 the most lethal form of friction is self-induced.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000 It's what you do to yourself.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000 And fear of the unknown breeds this paralysis.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000 It is best overcome by vigorous leadership, which clearly sets out what is happening, how it is happening,
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000 and most importantly, why it is happening.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000 So again, it is almost,
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000 I don't know if at some point I'm going to stop being surprised and stop being shocked and stop.
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:49.000 Being stopped being amazed in the parallels between the war and life.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000 And this is just one of them.
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000 Another one of them.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000 To the self-induced friction.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000 Yes.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000 I think a big one that I've kind of noticed in, I think, most people have this as pet peeves.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000 You know, people have these pet peeves about, like for example, when people call me boss,
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000 you know, you know, when people say, hey, what's up?
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000 You just talked about on those first podcast.
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000 Yeah, so, well, some friction with echoed girls.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000 Yeah, and this totally self-induced don't mean anything bad by the word boss.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000 But, meanwhile, I have this little almost check against them, because they prefer to me as boss or dude.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000 I don't know why dude, actually, you know what?
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000 If a girl calls me dude, it seems real condescending even though I'm figure they don't.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000 But that could jam up the relationship and potentially jam up any kind of task we have.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000 That can be just just one little element that I jam you up and pet peeves in general.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000 I know it will get in people's way.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000 Yeah, pet peeves are stupid in my opinion.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000 So you need to correct yourself on that one.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000 Yeah.
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000 But they're all, I mean, we could just sit here and the rest of this podcast could be, you know,
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000 I come in up with the various frictions in life, whether it's, you know,
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000 who want to sleep more, want not, not the gym isn't close enough to my house.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000 You know, you know, it's, you got a million reasons.
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000 You got a million pieces of friction.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000 Countless, or as they say, as the Marine Corps says, countless minor incidents,
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000 the kind you can never really foresee, combine to lower the general level of performance,
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000 so that one always falls short of the intended goal.
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000 And this is very similar to class fits here.
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000 Iron will power can overcome this friction.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000 It polverizes every obstacle.
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000 But of course, it wears down the machine as well.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000 You can see they obviously took that directly from class fits.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000 Whatever form it takes, because war is a human enterprise,
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000 friction will always have a psychological as well as a physical impact.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000 So you're getting worn.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000 You are getting worn down by the friction.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000 Friction is inevitable.
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000 Marine leaders must accept it.
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000 Do everything in their power to minimize its effects and learn to fight effectively in spite of it.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:20.000 What I, one of the things that I really like about this term is that it captures everything.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000 And it turns everything, you know, it clarifies what you're up against.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000 You're not just up against all these little things.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000 You're up against friction.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000 And actually, I was with Joe Rogan, and he talked about this book,
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000 The War of Art, which I haven't read yet.
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000 I press field.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000 And he does the same thing.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000 But what does he call it?
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000 Because it resisted.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000 And so it's the same idea.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000 You know, you put a name on your enemy.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000 You identify them whether it's laziness or sugar or sugar.
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000 Or lack of movement or whatever that thing is.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000 That's what they do.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000 And it allows you to identify it and be aware of what is happening.
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000 Now speaking of how to overcome that, this next part of leadership here is.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000 And we already mentioned it's will.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000 And it's something that I obviously identify as extremely important.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000 Because it's the driver of life.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000 It's the driver of your discipline as your will to make things happen.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000 And it keeps us on the path.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000 You know, it keeps us on the path to victory.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000 And I talked about it when I was on the Sam Harris podcast.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000 And I also talked about it on the history channel when they, for the lived-a-tell episode,
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000 which is about Mark Lee, the first seal killed in Iraq.
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000 And I talked about, you know, what is it take to win?
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000 And the most important thing it takes to win is will.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000 The will to win.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000 So the Marine Corps goes into a story.
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000 That's about will.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000 And I'm going to read it.
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000 A sign to defend a three-mile mountain pass along the division's main supply line and commanding the only route of approach.
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000 Captain Barber took position with his battle-weary troops.
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000 And before nightfall, had dug in and set up a defense along the frozen snow-covered hillside.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000 When a force of estimated regimental strength savagely attacked during the night in flipping heavy casualties and finally surrounding his position.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000 Following a bitterly fought seven-hour conflict.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:53.000 Captain Barber, after repulsing the enemy, gave assurance that he could hold if supplied by air drops and requested permission to stand fast.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000 After orders were received to fight his way back to a relieving force.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000 After two reinforcing units had been driven back under fierce resistance in attempts to reach the isolated troops.
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000 So here was Captain Barber with his troops that are on this ridge line.
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000 They hold off the enemy and then they get told, hey, you know what?
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000 Now that you've held the enemy off, go ahead and fight back to our position.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000 And he says, no.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000 No, we're not fighting back.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000 We're going to stay here.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000 We're going to hold this ground.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000 Although severely wounded, Captain Barber continued to maintain personal control,
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:43.000 often moving up and down the lines on a stretcher to direct defense, and consistently encourage and inspiring his men to supreme efforts, despite the staggering opposition.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:52.000 Waging desperate battle throughout five days and six nights have repeated onslaughts launched by fanatical aggressors.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000 He and his heroic command accounted for approximately 1,000 enemy dead in this epic stand in bitter, sub-zero weather.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:12.000 And when the company was relieved, only 82 of his original 220 men were able to walk away from the position, so valiantly defended against insuparable odds.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:22.000 His profound faith and courage, great personal valor and unwavering fortitude, which is in other words his will,
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:34.000 were decisive factors in the successful withdrawal of the division from the death trap in the chosen reservoir sector.
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000 That's a will.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000 And that shows you what will is capable of.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000 I mean, when you talk about sub-zero temperatures, you put, you just put people out in sub-zero temperatures for a night.
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000 That will break most people.
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000 Now get attacked all night.
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000 Now stay up there for five days and six nights.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.000 It's just the only thing that can win in that battle is will, human will.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000 From the same battle, Lieutenant Colonel Murray, who was commanding the fifth Marines at the chosen reservoir,
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000 and he was summoned up what was required of leaders. And this is very impactful when I read this.
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000 I personally felt in a state of shock.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000 The kind of shock one gets from some great personal tragedy, the sudden loss of someone close.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000 So he gets into this bad situation.
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000 That's what he feels. This guy is the commander of all those Marines in the chosen reservoir.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000 This shock, like someone like someone's died and he feels it.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000 And then he says, my first fight was within myself.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:59.000 I had to rebuild that emptiness of spirit.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000 And you know, I get asked. I've gotten asked on Twitter. I've gotten some direct messages.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000 I've gotten people that ask me about loss. They've lost people that are close to them.
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000 Whether it's guys talking about being in combat or whether it's people that are in civilian world and disease or accident.
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000 It's taken people from them.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000 And I think one of the things that, the kind of the thing that I say to people when they say,
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000 Look, this is crushing me and I feel horrible and I don't know if I'm going to be able to get back.
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000 And my first statement is always like, of course, of course.
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.000 And that is normal. It is normal for you to feel that way when you lose people.
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000 And you could see that this, you know, Lieutenant Colonel in combat,
00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.000 he went through the same thing. This hardcore badass Marine had to go, okay, I feel this loss and I have to rebuild.
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000 I have to rebuild the fight was within himself.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:15.000 And so I think that's very important for people that are listening to this podcast that are in the military.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:23.000 You are going on the battlefield and you, if you're in the, if you're fighting long enough, you will have casualties.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:33.000 And that is one of the things I know when my guys were killed, I felt the same damn thing, the horrible,
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000 wretched emptiness.
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000 And I knew I had to rebuild it.
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000 And so reading this quote definitely brings me back to that.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000 And it clarifies it when I talk to other people about losing someone that that loss that you're feeling,
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000 that emptiness, that shock is normal.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000 And it's okay. And don't think that it's going to just disappear. You've got to rebuild it.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000 You've got to rebuild that spirit.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:31.000 And so this manual goes on to say, for leaders to hold units together under adverse conditions, they first must fight and win the battle within themselves.
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000 And that's not me talking. That is this manual talking. That is the Marine Corps talking about leading Marines.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000 They know that there's a battle going on within you, that there's a battle you've got to fight every day,
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000 that there's a spirit that's going to be rebuilt when it's broken down.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000 This is what combat is, this is what war is, and this is what life is.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000 It goes on to talk about the difference between peace time and combat.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:14.000 Leading in combat is vastly different from leading in peace time. Anybody can give orders and have them obeyed at a peace time poster station.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:27.000 There, nothing blocks the way to obedience. The brig, meaning jail, pay reductions in emotion, may be all the incentive necessary to instill good order in discipline.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000 But execution of orders in combat may mean immediate danger or even a likelihood of getting killed.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000 The Marines, the Marine needs to know why an order is given and how it is to be executed.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000 We talk about this all the time. People have gotten to know why they're doing what they're doing.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000 And I'll tell you, the first section of that, the Marines don't leave like that.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000 The Marines don't go around saying, hey, you will do this or all sent you to the brig.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000 Pay reductions or emotions. That's not how leadership works and it's not that way in the Marine court. Of course, those are there.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000 If you need them, but you don't want to lead like that, you don't want to lead with beatings.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000 Yeah.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:17.000 Above all, Marines need to feel that the leader giving the order knows what he or she is about.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000 Even given the best trainings, how Marines perform will depend on the kind of leadership they had.
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000 By the example and courage demonstrated by their leader.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000 Napoleon said, there are no bad regiments, only bad kernels, which is very interesting.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000 And it's a very common statement that Napoleon said, and, you know, we've talked about face on this because David Hackworth says,
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000 there's no bad units, only bad officers. And then, lay for an eye and extreme ownership.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000 We have, there's no bad teams, only bad leaders.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.000 Yeah.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000 And you know, we say, there's no bad students, there's only bad teachers.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000 So there's no bad students, there's only bad instructors.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000 That's the same thing.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000 It's the same thing.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:14.000 And, you know, from Napoleon to Hackworth to lay for an eye, saying that, what the Marine court is saying here, a unit led by an able and aggressive leader, a aggressive leader.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:26.000 Who commands respect because he sets the example and demonstrated courage and confidence will perform any task asked of them.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000 Not some tasks, not most of the tasks, not the easy tasks, any task.
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000 A aggressive leader who commands respect because he set the example and demonstrated courage and confidence will perform any task asked of them.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000 That's what leadership is about.
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000 Now we get into the moral challenge.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.000 Armies of superior numbers have been put to flight before one man out of ten is fallen.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000 They were not beaten by blows, which became more than flesh could bear.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000 They were beaten in spirit, according to laws as old as the human heart.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000 And the victor is the one who can best apply those laws.
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:34.000 So you can have a great, a huge force, a much bigger force, and they can break before anyone's even been killed or when of only a few people have been killed because their spirit is broken.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:44.000 When people conduct lives built on high moral standards and physical fitness, they tend to develop qualities that produce inspired leadership and discipline.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000 It is not a new notion. It could be found in any great military force in the past.
00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:05.000 The gaining moral ascendancy requires that subordinates feel that their leaders genuinely care for them, that they are fighting for a worthy cause and ensuring that their sacrifices are not made in vain.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000 I talk about that one regularly.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:26.000 Your people have got to know that you cannot think that you care about them. They got to know that you care about them. That's what leadership is. You're leading this group because you care about this group.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:45.000 Acting as a buffer to protect subordinates is a key responsibility of any leader. Leaders must avoid passing the buck. Leaders must, if necessary, act from the courage of their own convictions, even when such a position runs counter to the policy of seniors.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:38:01.000 We talked about that last time. Remember Napoleon said that if you're following my orders and you get a bunch of guys killed, it's your fault. You're culpable if it's a bad plan. If you listen, if you obeyed my bad order, it's your fault.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:13.000 It's the same thing that's being said here. Even when a position runs counter to the policy of seniors. Leaders must always accept full responsibility for their actions.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:22.000 Hello. Extreme. Extreme ownership right there. Leaders must always accept full responsibility for actions for their actions.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000 And like you said extreme ownership. That's what our books about trying to make that.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:38.000 At the utmost level of responsibility is to own everything that's happening regardless of who's it fault, who might be it fault.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000 One of their factors were in play doesn't matter. Take ownership of it all.
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Now we get into physical challenge.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:02.000 The physical demands of battle encompass more than being fit. And these demands influence both the leader and the lead.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000 The effects of sleep deprivation, poor diet, poor hygiene, and most importantly, fear.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:17.000 Have to be understood and be a part of everyday training. No one is immune to fatigue.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:30.000 As Marines become increasingly tired, they may lose the ability to make rapid decisions and are susceptible to being confused, disoriented, and ultimately ineffective.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000 Guards and pride are not a substitute for fitness.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:45.000 And one one place where that becomes completely evident is in mixed martial arts where you get guys.
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000 They got a lot of guts and they got a lot of pride.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:04.000 But you think all this person's never going to tap. Once they get broken down and fatigue sets in, fatigue makes coward of us all.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:12.000 It's not a substitute. So guts and pride are not a substitute for fitness. They're a good augment to fitness, but they don't take the place of it.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:20.000 A leader relying on guts and pride will not be able to fully concentrate on the mission or the task at hand.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.000 Exact limits of endurance cannot be determined, but physical conditioning is one method of reducing the effects of physical exertion.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000 And it can increase individual self confidence and reduce stress. So how always tell people to work out.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:44.000 That's why you got to get up and go because it increases individual self confidence and reduces stress.
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000 I'm produces the effect of physical exertion. It's just good so many benefits.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000 Yeah, and that's the I think the most important is that it reduces the effects later.
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:10.000 So, you know, if you're in shape, your heart's strong, your mind is strong because you've worked out your whole life or just your just into fitness, you perform.
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:20.000 There was this man I heard this thing where it was an article, right, where it said, why exercise is the most important part of business.
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:29.000 And the whole thing was, you know, it said a lot, the whole thing was exercises the only thing that affects every other part of your life, the only thing.
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000 So you can have all these other traits and, you know, and sure they might affect one thing.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000 Most things don't affect anything. They just affect that one thing. Like if you have money, you go, okay, you have money and that affects like XYZ.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000 But exercise will affect your ability to make money. It'll affect your relationship. It'll affect everything. And it's the one thing that does.
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000 Break out your jump rope, people, get out your kettlebells, time to get it on.
00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:06.000 Yeah. That's why if you ever get in a relationship where the girl's like, oh, you know, you put the gym or do you get to or something before me?
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000 That's a red flag. Red flag.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000 Yeah, red flag. I'm not saying break up with I'm saying that's a red flag.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000 It is a warning. Yes.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000 It is a warning. It's some friction. That's some friction. That's a friction.
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:29.000 The physical development back to the book of the physical development of marine leaders must include dealing with the nature natural fear of interpersonal violence,
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000 which contributes significantly to the fog and friction of combat,
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:43.000 dealing with the fear of interpersonal violence. So I talked about this with Sam Harris.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000 And that is if you're, you know, one of the worst things that happens when somebody gets assaulted,
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000 if they've never been had somebody on them grinding on them before and grabbing them and holding them and smashing them,
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000 they've never had that feeling before. They're already way behind. They're a way behind because they're just not used to it.
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000 They're completely new to them. Yeah, whereas obviously someone that trains in martial arts,
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000 like you jitsu, where you're, you're, you're getting round on and people are smashing you and you're used to it.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000 It's part of your deal. It's part of your life.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:26.000 Man, and you, and you've been in actual fire fights, but that's why getting some sort of a gun training or firearm training is good,
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000 because if you've never shot a gun before and you fire it, you don't watch your movies and stuff,
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000 that's not prepared for how loud that is. And they're like, just the, just the impact and your whole,
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000 your whole thing, you know, when, when you fire a gun. So if that were to happen in some stressful situation,
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000 someone attacks you or someone fires a gun in your presence and it's, you know, this commotion,
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.000 just dealing with the fact that a gun was fired alone is like this huge battle that you have to,
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000 they, they, essentially lost because you're not, you just not used to it. That's a hit, you know?
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000 You need to inoculate yourself to these situations. Yeah. And we will actually be talking about that a little later tonight.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000 Yeah, man.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:15.000 Units and their leaders that do not have the mental and physical strength to overcome fear will not be able to fight effectively and overcome friction.
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:26.000 In fact, one of the greatest sources of friction is physical exertion, and it may be required of individuals, units, or both.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:34.000 And again, the physical exertion thing, you know, we do at the gym, we do shark tank, right?
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000 So guys got to fight coming up, or guys got to turn them and coming up. And so we put them in the middle and they're getting fresh guys, you know,
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000 every two minutes, one minute, sometimes four minutes, sometimes five minutes depending on what they're going into.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000 But you can watch and see a total destroyer of a guy.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:59.000 After they breach that breaking point, just get mopped up. And again, we're taking them there for a reason.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:08.000 You know, we're taking them there, so they do have to rely on their technique. And so they do get conditioned and anoculated against that breaking point.
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000 So they learn how to dig even deeper.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000 Yeah.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:20.000 But you can get anyone there. I mean, you can get anyone so physically exhausted that they're no longer capable of, you know, doing even the slight percentage of what they would normally be capable of.
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000 So you have to maintain that conditioning at the highest level all the time that you can.
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000 And that's like, I mean, really, like you're saying, it's, it's not just the physical conditioning.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:41.000 You're conditioning them to the situation like well, how you said when they're beyond their physical kind of breaking point where they don't have all their strength.
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000 Right.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000 The point where you feel like stopping going beyond that point, if you rarely or never been beyond that point,
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000 once you get there, you're completely done.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000 Yeah.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000 You want to realize that you can push through that.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 Yeah.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000 There's a little more that you think there is.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000 Yeah.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000 You get conditioned to it and you're ready for it.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000 Yeah.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:08.000 The gain in more force, deriving from all forms of physical training is an unconscious gain.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000 Yeah.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000 I actually think it's not just an unconscious gain.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000 I think it's a conscious gain too.
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000 I think when I get, when I train, I feel better.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000 I feel stronger.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000 I feel sharper.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:34.000 Willpower, determination, mental, poison, and muscle control are all March hand in hand with a general health and well-being of the individual.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:46.000 So, again, according to the Marine Corps, that this physical training increases your willpower, your determination, your mental, poison, your muscle control, clearly.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:59.000 As you stated earlier, physical training is important across the board.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000 Establishing and maintaining standards.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:13.000 Maintaining this attitude and standard of excellence is a responsibility not limited to officers, staff non-commission officers, or non-commissioned officers.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000 It is the responsibility of all Marines.
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000 That's the attitude you want to have with your team, with your company, with your business, that that attitude of excellence.
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000 And maintaining the standard of excellence isn't responsibility just of the leadership as the responsibility of everyone.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:42.000 Leadership in the long run depends upon the example set by the leader, not only as a war fighter, but also as a citizen and a human being.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:48:04.000 So, the leader has to display a high level of, I'm not sure what the right word is, a high level of bearing, a high level of presence in all situations, not just as a Marine, but in all levels.
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:16.000 Setting a personal example requires high moral standards reflecting virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination in personal behavior and in performance.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000 These inner qualities that mark leaders, these are the inner qualities that mark leaders.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:33.000 Rather than outward marks of greatness, they are often deeply buried, and in many cases, one must look closely to see an individual's inner strength.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000 So, you're not always going to see, it's not always a guy beat in his chest.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000 That's the best leader.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000 And that has an example of that here, Major General John A. Lizzoon.
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:55.000 Describe Medal of Honor recipient, Sergeant Major John H. Quick, perhaps of all the Marines I ever knew.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:06.000 Quick approached more nearly the perfect type of non-commissioned officer, a calm, forceful, intelligent, loyal and courageous man he was.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:25.000 I never knew him to raise his voice, Luzes' temper, used profane language, and yet he exacted and obtained prompt and explicit obedience from all persons subject to his orders.
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:45.000 The image of the Marine-Barking Orders, you have to balance that. You have to balance that with the reality of the example just given Major John H. Quick.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:57.000 In the Marine Corps, we are trained to endure combat violence and death, along with other less arduous situations in both peace and war.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:08.000 Simply because we bear arms and wield awesome power, we do not have limitless authority to unleash it without due requirement.
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:19.000 We may not say, as one enemy commander said, kill all burn all, destroy all.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:34.000 So again, the image and the stereotype of a Marine or of a American soldier has to be balanced with the facts of who they really are.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:47.000 And that is that they are trained, that they don't have limitless authority to unleash the awesome power without due requirement.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:03.000 Now, of course, we, these are human beings, and there are military people in the Marine Corps, the Army and the SEAL teams and special operations that go over the line.
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:13.000 And that's something that gets dealt with. So I'm not sitting here claiming that this is a, you know, a perfect situation.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:26.000 But I am giving you the ideal that the Marine Corps itself sets out upon its Marines of what it wants their Marines to be like.
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:36.000 And a good, we actually used to say this in the SEAL teams as well. And this is how do you figure out when something is like, you know, the right thing to do, do the right thing.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.000 Because sometimes doing the right thing is opposed to what you're being ordered to do or what the rules are.
00:51:43.000 --> 00:52:02.000 If you are prepared to talk about your actions or lack thereof in front of a national audience made up of all your seniors, peers, subordinates and friends who share the same professional values and whose opinions you value, then your behavior was or is probably ethical and nature.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000 So when you're doing something, if you say, okay, I'm going to go on, you know, cable news tomorrow and I'm going to debrief everybody what I did.
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.000 And if you can be proud of it, then it was ethical. And if you're going to be hanging your head low, then it wasn't a good decision. You weren't doing the right thing.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000 And that is definitely something that I used to guide my judgment.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:35.000 And because that again, the rules are not always what they should be. And what the rules, they don't fit over the situation that you're in.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:42.000 And the law is a dynamic thing. And so sometimes the rules that have been put in place for one region, they don't work in the region you're in.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:49.000 And so you have to say, okay, you know what, by the book, they could burn me on this one.
00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:05.000 But I can look whoever's charging me and say, this is what I did and this is why I did it. And if you want to send me to the to Leavenworth for that, get out the handcuffs and let's go.
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:24.000 This is a powerful, this is a powerful paragraph on about the region. It's actually if you listen to the the the podcast that I did with Sam Harris, this is just a, this is a little bit of a different spend on bravery and on courage.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:35.000 Courage can be misunderstood. It is more than the ability to overcome the jitters to quail fear to conquer the desire to run.
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000 It is the ability to know what is or is not to be feared.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:50.000 An infantry, an infantryman charging a bunker is not hampered by the fear that he might be struck down a few paces from his fighting hole.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:00.000 A pilot is not afraid of losing all hydraulic power in his aircraft. They are both prepared for those outcomes.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:10.000 A marine in battle fears discracing himself by running. He fears not losing his life, but losing his honor.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.000 He may not be able to preserve his life, but he can always preserve his honor.
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:34.000 That much is within his power to fear disgrace, but not death, to fear not duty, but dereliction from duty. This is courage.
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:52.000 The truly courageous do not live an anxiety from morning to night. They are calm because they know who they are.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:05.000 In that last two sentences about the truly courageous do not live an anxiety from morning to night. They are calm because they know who they are.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:13.000 And I definitely, when I hear that statement, I think about the guys that I know that were truly courageous.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:36.000 And how they did have that almost peaceful attitude of acceptance because they knew who they were, and they knew what they would do if the moment came for them.
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:44.000 Another type of more kind of overt courage here from Major Jim Crow.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:53.000 Former enlisted man, Marine Gunner, distinguished rifleman, star football player, was a tower of strength throughout the battle.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:02.000 His trademark Red Mustache bristling, a combat shotgun, cradled in his arms. He exuded confidence and professionalism.
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:12.000 Crowe ordered the coxon of his landing craft. Put this goddamn boat in.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:19.000 The boat hit the reef at a high speed, sending the marine sprawling. Quickly recovering. Crowe ordered his men over the sides.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:26.000 Then led them through several hundred yards of shallow water, reaching the shore intact only four minutes behind the last wave.
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:33.000 Crowe clenching a cigar in his teeth and standing upright, groubling it as men.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.000 Look, the sun's a bitch as can't hit me. Why do you think they can hit you? Get moving, go!
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000 Red Beach 3 was incapable hands.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:58.000 Kind of a larger than life, a larger than life image of courage.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:07.000 Adaptability. Adaptability has long been our key to overcoming the effects of friction and its components.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.000 Although it is synonymous with flexibility, adaptability also embraces the spirit of innovation.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:21.000 Marines constantly seek to adapt new tactics, organization and procedures to the realities of the environment.
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Deficiencies in existing practices are identified, outdated structure discarded, and modifications made to maintain function and utility.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000 That's a little something you might want to do in your life.
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:45.000 Deficiencies in existing practices are identified, outdated structure discarded, and modifications made to maintain function and utility.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000 Yes. Go ahead and note to yourself.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:59.000 The ability to adapt enables Marines to be comfortable within an environment dominated by friction.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:07.000 We just talked about innovation. Innovation has always been a key component of Marine Court tradition and our style of leadership.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000 It is come naturally because our combatant function was and is unique.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.000 Innovation requires that leaders listen to their subordinates.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:28.000 I'm going to say that again. Innovation requires that leaders listen to their subordinates and that a two-way system of communication is maintained.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Corporals, sergeants, captains, and generals all have responsibility to be innovators.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000 That's everybody in your chain of command has a responsibility to be innovation.
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:51.000 Because innovation is imprecise and because subordinates, especially junior ones will make mistakes protect them.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:59.000 Zero defects are not a standard of measurement. They do not encourage initiative. They stifulate.
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000 So you're junior folks and some of your junior leadership and maybe some of your senior leadership.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:15.000 They're going to make some mistakes and you've got to protect them and encourage them to continue on to try to be innovative.
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:22.000 If we wish to think clearly, if you wish to free your mind, if you wish to think clearly, we must cease imitating.
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.000 If we wish to cease imitating, we must make use of our imagination.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:36.000 Now, how often is it that you see a Marine and his service dress blue uniform looking like a statue of perfection?
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.000 How often is it that you think that their manual tells them that they have to make use of their imagination?
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.000 People don't get that image. Now, I've said this before and I'll say it again.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.000 Combat is an absolute exercise and creativity. That's what it is.
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000 And you've got to use your imagination.
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:09.000 We must train ourselves for the unexpected in place of training others for the cut and dried.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000 Audacity and not caution must be our watch word.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000 Got to take some risks.
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000 Got to take some risks.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:28.000 Now, here's a term that I just like, as a matter of fact, I'm going to use the L word. I love this term.
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000 The term is fighting power.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:44.000 Fighting power is an organization's ability to conduct combat operations by overcoming challenges to lead, compete, and prevail on the battlefield.
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:55.000 Fighting power rests on mental, intellectual, and organizational foundations in its manifestations in one combination or another.
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:10.000 Our discipline and cohesion, morale and initiative, courage and toughness, the willingness to fight and the readiness if necessary to die.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:21.000 Fighting power in brief is defined as the sum total of mental and physical qualities that make armies fight.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000 And you know what? I just added something in there because it actually says mental qualities that make armies fight.
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.000 And I'm adding mental and physical qualities because we've talked about the physical qualities and how important it is.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000 Fighting power in brief is defined as the sum total of mental and physical qualities that make army fight make armies fight.
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:50.000 And what I like about this idea of fighting power is what can you do to improve your fighting power to die.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:00.000 What can you do? Is what you're doing helpful? Are you moving it forward? Are you increasing your fighting power?
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000 Are you decreasing it? Are you going backwards?
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000 That's the real question here.
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:16.000 And I think that when you realize that what you do in your life is either doing one or two things.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000 It's either increasing your fighting power or decreasing your fighting power.
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000 Because if you're staying stagnant, you're basically going backwards.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000 And here's a little wrap up.
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000 Here's the leadership principles.
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.000 Be technically and tactically proficient. Know yourself and seek self-improvement.
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000 Boom. Know your Marines and look out for their welfare.
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000 Keep your Marines informed.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000 Set the example.
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000 Ensure the task is understood, supervised, and accomplished.
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000 Train your Marines as a team.
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000 Make sound and timely decisions.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000 Develop a sense of responsibility among your subordinates.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000 A little decentralized command.
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000 Employ your unit in accordance with its capabilities.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000 Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions once again ownership.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000 And I like the Seek responsibility and a little seal saying that we used to have was a look for work.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000 So if there's nothing going on, look for work.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000 You know, see a new guy standing there not knowing what to do.
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000 Hey, go look for work.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000 Means go pick up a security position.
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000 Go help move bodies. Go do something.
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000 Make something happen.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000 Seek responsibility.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.000 And this last statement is just a note to remind everybody of the troopers on the front.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000 The troopers on the front lines throughout history.
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:16.000 The time always comes in battle when the decisions of statesmen and of generals can no longer affect the issue.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000 And when it's not the power of our national wealth to change the balance decisively.
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000 Victory has never achieved prior to that point.
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:38.000 It can only be one after the battle has been delivered into the hands of men who move in imminent danger of death.
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000 And that's SLA Marshall.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000 The folks on the front lines.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000 So for everyone out there that's listening to this podcast, that's all on the front lines right now.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000 I salute you all.
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000 Let's get to the questions.
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000 All right.
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:09.000 Okay, first question from Narco 31-E11.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000 Will you guys cover injury recovery and the mentality to quick recovery?
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000 And advice, not to find physical limit without injury.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000 Okay. So for this one.
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000 Well, first of all, train hard.
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000 But always train smart.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000 You know, don't do things that are going to hurt you.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000 And this is a balance just like everything else you have to push yourself hard enough that you get stronger.
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000 But at the same time, you can't push yourself so hard that you get injured.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000 So I think that's one of the keys.
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000 Another key is making sure you take adequate rest.
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:05.000 Which, of course, I'm usually guilty of not doing that being said when you see me training every day.
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000 I'm not, you know, I'm not going 110% every day.
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000 There are some days where I roll under the gym and I say,
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000 Yeah, okay, this is not it. This is not it. I push myself. I'm injury prone today.
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000 You know, and so I will taper my workout.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000 And I'll usually do some other kind of intensity.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000 But let's say I'm not going to lift heavy weights or I'm not going to sprint because I'm feeling tight.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000 And I want to pull muscle.
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000 So you just, you've got to listen to what your body's saying.
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000 Another thing that I think is important about it is, you know, we talked about on the last podcast is,
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000 changing your goals and constantly chasing after different goals.
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000 You know, we're going for a deadlift and then you're going for a mile time run and then you're going for number of goals.
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000 And you're constantly kind of changing those.
01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:00.000 And I think that is a good way to avoid injury because you're not just hammering the same thing over and over again,
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000 which I think leads injury now. That being said,
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000 you don't ever want to just completely stop, you know, elements of your workout.
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000 You know, you want to keep that's why it's good to not go in these extreme directions.
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000 And I'll tell you, what I think is the most important thing for me,
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000 for being relatively injury-free.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000 I don't know if it ought to list all my injuries on the next question,
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000 but relatively injury-free is that I always work out.
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000 I always work out.
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000 And I think that when people, I think when people take extended periods of time off,
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000 and by that I think I mean, you know, you're starting to get into like two weeks,
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000 three weeks, maybe a month of not doing anything.
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000 I think when people come back from those is when they get injured,
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000 when they get hurt because their body's just, it's still strong.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000 It still thinks it can do what it did three weeks ago,
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000 but it can't. It's not conditioned for it.
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000 And that's when that's when you get hurt.
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000 Another good piece I think for recovery and is the Isamo Poti Wat.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000 Kelly K-star, you know, Go to mobilitywaw.com and just look at that.
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000 Look at what he's doing. Look at what he's putting out.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000 He's got some great stuff to heal yourself and square away your injuries.
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000 I think stretching is important, but I think people take it to an excess,
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000 and I think when you do too much of it, I think it's, I think it's causes problems.
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000 I know, I know some guys that have done extreme yoga,
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000 and I think extreme yoga is, you know,
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000 once you go beyond what is normal or a little beyond normal,
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000 you start to injure yourself and I think that's not good.
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000 I think it leads to, you know, joint laxity where your,
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000 your joints can actually move too much, and there's not enough holding them in place.
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000 So there's the ability, right? Right.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000 And so I think just listen to your body.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000 And I think the next part of this question will answer in the next question.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000 Hmm.
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000 Just to kind of add to that nutrition as well.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000 Oh, yeah. So a lot of people, especially if they're trying to cut up or drop some weight,
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000 and you know, if you're training for something, you got to make weight that's,
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000 you know, that's going to be a little bit more specific strategy, but
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000 a lot of times people will starve themselves.
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000 Yeah. I'm always telling people like when they're feeling negative,
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000 and they're feeling like they're injury, but I'm always telling people they're probably lacking fats.
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000 They're probably lacking good fats, you know?
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000 Yeah.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000 So I agree with you diet is extremely important.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000 Yeah.
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000 And when you work on this, what I learned early on and understanding the importance of this,
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000 I think really, really helped is if you eat right after you work out,
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000 don't think that you're going to eat a meal, and that's going to fuel your workout.
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000 Because it takes a while for the calories to go into your system.
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000 Yeah.
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000 Fuel workout.
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000 It's not going to do it in like an hour.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000 So don't eat.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000 So go workout then eat after.
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000 So that those calories and those nutrients will help your body recover.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000 And within that hour, that's when your body wants to recover.
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.000 Yeah.
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000 And wants those nutrients.
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000 Yeah.
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000 So doing that, if you starve yourself or don't eat or eat very little,
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000 your muscles are going to be recovered.
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000 Your tendons are going to be a little bit more weak.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000 Even when you do recover, it didn't take in those nutrients.
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000 Yeah.
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000 So you will be way more prone.
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000 I probably need to do a better job of that as you will.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000 People always ask me, and I get done working out, you know, like five or six,
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000 well, maybe six o'clock in the morning.
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000 I'm done working out.
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000 And I usually don't eat until 9 or 10, you know?
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000 So I probably need to do better job of that.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000 I'll take echo Charles to sit by.
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000 So that one.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000 Yeah.
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000 That's fun.
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000 But I've opened mine.
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000 So it's cool.
01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000 I can do that.
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000 Yeah.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000 In the body building world, that's like a no brainer called the anabolic window.
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000 And it's like, you can see little jokes on it.
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000 Where it's like kind of jump through that.
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000 All he best is anabolic window.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000 And it shows a picture of like a guy holding a guy dying or something.
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000 Yeah.
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000 It's a real important thing.
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000 And it helps so much.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000 We'll give it a shot.
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000 Right on.
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000 Next question.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000 From.
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000 What honey bees do?
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000 Oh.
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000 When it's all one word, it's just kind of strange.
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000 Okay.
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000 What honey bees do?
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000 You're not on the decoding.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000 Yeah, you're not on the decoding.
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000 You're not on the decoding.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000 I'm not on the decoding.
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000 You're not on the decoding.
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000 You're not on the decoding.
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000 It's what honey bees do.
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000 You never had honey bees do.
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000 What the honey bees do.
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000 What injuries.
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000 Just what honey bees do.
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000 Not the honey bees.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000 All right.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000 You get a third chance.
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000 What injuries have you gotten?
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000 And how did you adapt?
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000 So obviously active lifestyle.
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:14.000 You know, growing up and spending my life in the sealed teams.
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000 Tone of injuries from everything.
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000 I've had MCL terror of spraying ankles, shoulders, wrists, lower back, elbows.
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000 But the most serious actual injury that I had was a head neck.
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000 I had neck surgery.
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000 So I had a foreman on me and my neck, which is they go in and they scrape some bone away from the foreman.
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000 Which hurt bad when they did it.
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000 But it's been really good.
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000 I was really, I mean, I had like lost movement in my arm for a little while.
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000 I write arm from your neck.
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000 From my neck injury.
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000 How did you do that?
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000 Just grinding over time.
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000 And you know, I remember there's one part of seal training where you're carrying these boats on your head.
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000 Which is not that big of a deal.
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000 But then the instructors would jump from boat to boat.
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000 So you get these 200 pound instructors and they're just jumping.
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000 They're boats on your head and they're jumping from boat to boat.
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000 And it's, I remember an instructor jumping into the boat and landing pretty much where I was.
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000 And I remember hearing a grinding noise in my neck.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000 And I, you know, of course, I was 19 years old.
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000 So I didn't care bringing on.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000 But they don't, they don't do that anymore.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000 You don't jump from boat to boat anymore, which is cool.
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000 They shouldn't.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000 It's not good for you.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.000 So, but anyways, with all these injuries, whether it's MCL, Terre, whether it's, you know, high ankle sprains.
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.000 And, and all kinds of ligament damages in my, in my ankles and my lower back, which I've injured a few times,
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000 almost almost all muscular there.
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000 Uh, what I do is I do the same thing with all of them.
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000 And that is I do whatever I can.
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000 And if I, if I, when I hurt my knee and I couldn't squat, I could do like a quarter squat.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000 I did a quarter squats.
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000 You know, I'd go out the garage and I'd stand there with nobody waiting to do quarter squats and get the blood moving.
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000 And, you know, then I'd try and do my other body parts and, you know, could do pull up still.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000 And so I did dead hangpuls.
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000 I couldn't even move my knee to like, keep it all.
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000 So I did what I could there.
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000 You know, so you can't do ring dips, do regular dips.
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000 If you can't do dips, do push ups.
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000 You can't do push ups. You can't do push ups. Push off of a wall.
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000 Whatever it takes to get something done.
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000 You can't lift that 40 kilogram kettlebell lift the 24 kilogram kettlebell.
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000 Just do something move, get the blood in there.
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000 And I don't always get the blood in there because I always think that the more you're moving and the more you're using that range of motion,
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000 the faster you're going to heal.
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000 You know, you're just circulating more repairing nutrients to your body.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000 So it would make sense to me that that's going to help you heal.
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000 Now, of course, you can read damage. You can go worse.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000 You know, if it hurts to do a quarter squat and so you do half squat, you're going backwards.
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000 Yeah.
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000 You know, so you want to stay within the range of motion,
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000 where you're not re-entering it or making it worse.
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000 So don't be stupid.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000 But do get the movement going.
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000 And also, I don't know what I would do mentally if I would couldn't do anything at all.
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000 Now when I hurt my neck, though, I was laid up.
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000 I didn't think I was going to be.
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000 I was going to go power through it.
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000 And then the tough guy, yeah.
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000 No, I was laid up with my head and just hurt him.
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000 And but I'll tell you as soon as I could get up and start trying to walk around,
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000 I did it. And like I said, try to stay sane.
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000 And then the other thing that happens is when you have these injuries,
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000 you know, you're, you got to adapt your goals.
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000 You know, and you got to set new goals.
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000 Okay. You know, and really, I've never really fully regained the strength in my right arm and my right path.
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000 It's not as strong as it was.
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000 And it's definitely way weaker than my other side.
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000 You know, it's probably at 70 or 80 percent.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000 And you know, I just have to say, okay, well, what can I do?
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000 It's like, okay, you're going to be normal human now.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000 You know, so, so here's what here's, here's what your new goals are.
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000 And I'm, you know, I'm still trying to improve and get better at whatever it is.
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000 But, you know, injuries are going to happen in life.
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000 And you've got to just do your best you can to work through them as smartly as you possibly can.
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000 And kind of to add to the, the train smart.
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000 This may seem obvious, but when you do like higher rep, like heavier weight or not higher reps,
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000 sorry, heavier weight, lower reps or real explosive stuff, you're going to be more prone to injury.
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000 So even being just more conscious of your movement.
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000 Yeah. And really avoiding those types of movements when you feel an injury start to come on,
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000 like if you get a little lower back thing or a shoulder thing.
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000 For sure.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000 Just be conscious of your movement way more.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000 Today I was dead lifting and I was like, no, okay, we're done dead lifting for the day.
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000 Yeah.
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000 And, and you know, I definitely spared myself being laid up.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000 You know, and I just got out the roller and just grounded out for a while, got out the ball, grounded out for a while.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000 But for sure, you got to listen, you got to pay attention.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000 And if you feel that little twins, it's no big deal.
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000 You know, there's plenty of other ways to get your, to get your workout on besides jack and the big steal.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000 So yeah, and you, um, like, how you're staying, bodyweight squats, you'll just do, you know, like if you're,
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.000 if you had a six-squat workout planned, and you feel your lower back or your IT band is a big one where
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000 when you, when you get after it in squats, that'll, um, a lot of times act up.
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000 Well, I spray my ankle, sick enough, probably four or five months ago, and it, I couldn't do, it was weird.
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000 It's one of those weird things.
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000 I couldn't do overhead squats, but I could do, oh, it's gross.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000 Like after a snatch.
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000 Yes, I couldn't do overhead squats because it hurt my ankle for whatever reason, but I could do front squats and regular squats.
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000 And I couldn't go to full, the ones I could still go to full depth on.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000 Again, I don't know why I'm not a physician.
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000 Front squats felt the best.
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000 So I started doing more, more front squats at the time, and then eventually, you know,
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000 and now I'm back to doing everything.
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000 So figure out what you can get away with, figure out what you can do and do it.
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000 Also, when it in regards to being conscious of, like, your movement a lot of times,
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000 I know this is the case for me, where I'll get little injuries from just like,
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.000 racking or unracking weights just because it's like, oh, maybe I need to do more functional training, my friend.
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000 I don't always get injured, but I think it's getting little things.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000 Because a lot of times that, it's like, it's unconscious.
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000 I'm just put this over here, and you're not, mean while if you do a clean and jerk,
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000 you're like, okay, I'm going to focus on this good technique.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000 So again, that goes along with being careful of your movement, being conscious of it.
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000 Especially when you feel when you hit that fatigue, when you've been working out for a three week straight,
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000 hard, very little rest, you're under, and you start to feel these little things come about.
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000 I think it's important to be conscious of those things.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000 Yes. And also, to what you were saying earlier, if my head's not in the game, I'm not Jack and the big weights.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:15.000 Yeah.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000 Because you've got to be thinking about it. You've got to be thinking about your body position before you do,
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000 before you just try and grab on this big weight and throw it around.
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000 Yeah.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000 You've got to get your head in the game.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000 All right. Next question. This was actually my question.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000 A question from Echo. I'm buying with a question from someone else.
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000 Yeah. Yes. Yes. Sure.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000 Okay. So public speaking, right? How did you, like I've seen some of your speeches,
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000 how did you get good at it? Because that's a daunting nerve-wracking thing.
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:55.000 In fact, like some people, they prefer death over public speaking. Literally.
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000 Yes. That's heavy.
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000 So what's your mindset, you know, for keeping from being nervous?
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000 And then that's coupled with another question here.
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000 Right. Which we got from the WEPS.
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000 Conquering fear in general. Right.
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000 Right. If you're a failure, a fear of rejection, the unknown.
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.000 What would your advice be to someone who wants to start a business or a major project?
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000 But they're held back by fear.
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:31.000 So this is, again, it's interesting for me because public speaking is not something
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000 that induces fear of me, it never has.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000 But I know that it does make people scared.
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:47.000 And I think that overcoming the key to any overcoming any fear in my mind is we talked about
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000 the law earlier, which is a noculation.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000 And this idea, and I actually looked up the definition of an occupation.
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000 And it's the introduction of a pathogen or antigen into a living organism to stimulate
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000 the production of antibiotic antibodies.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000 So you're giving yourself a little bit.
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000 Right. And you give yourself a little bit and you build up all of that.
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000 And that's what you do. You take the small doses.
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000 So it prepares you for the bigger, bigger doses.
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:20.000 And one of my daughters, my middle daughter, she was really wanting to be in the school play,
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000 right, and other plays around town.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000 And you know, okay, cool. Well, that's cool, but she was horrified to go out in front of an audience.
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000 horrified.
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000 And so I looked up and I said, okay, how do you stop in your kids from being
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000 getting stage fright? Is it what they call it?
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000 And you know, I read about people what they did and what I did was I said,
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000 I'd say, okay, sing a song for me.
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000 And it's not that big of a deal because I'm a dad.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000 So she'd sing a song for me.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000 And even then she'd be a little bit embarrassed, but she'd sing a song for me.
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000 And then you know, a couple days, they write my wife, hey, sing that song for both of us.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000 And then it was, oh, my wife's got a friend over. Hey, sing that song for the three of us.
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000 Because I get a mystery person and unknown in the room.
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000 Yeah, because she's overcoming that fear.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000 And each time she's getting a little bit more and more confident.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000 Because we took her to, what do they call triodes?
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000 What's triodes called audition?
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.000 Audition. We took her to a couple auditions where it was her turn and she didn't go.
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000 She broke down to crying and just just couldn't handle it.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000 And so then it was, then it was a few of my wife's friends over.
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000 Then it was some of my friends, Rovers. Now you got, you know, guys and girls.
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000 And each time she got more and more confident.
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000 And eventually she just didn't care anymore.
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000 And she was totally confident and she got the lead role in the school way.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000 She legitimately got the lead role in the school way.
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000 So she was able to overcome that fear.
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000 And in the sealed teams, we do the same kind of thing.
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000 We know where you're going to get a noculator to get stressed.
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000 As much as they can stress you out in the sealed teams, they're going to stress you out.
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000 You're going to be machine gunfire. You're going to be used to that.
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000 There's going to be explosives going off.
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000 You're going to be used to that. We used to do live fire, machine gun drills and
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000 And I add drills and immediate action drills.
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000 We are maneuvering around.
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000 We used to do that without your protection and sometimes so you get used to this crazy
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000 Manning.
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000 We don't do that anymore because it's not smart.
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000 But you do that to anoculate.
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000 It's like what you were talking about earlier.
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000 When that gun goes off, you should be completely comfortable with it.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000 There's one of my favorite stories on that one of my favorite stories.
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000 One of my buddy of mine who actually took my job.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000 I was a tasky to commander. He actually took my job as tasky to commander.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000 And a flash bang is a grenade that you throw into a room before you go into the room.
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000 And it makes a loud explosion and smoke.
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000 And then it allows you to enter in on the room when the people that are inside are now startled.
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000 So you have an advantage.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000 Well, occasionally you have to open the door to throw the crash in there.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000 And occasionally someone will open the door and someone will run in.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000 They're leading coordinator well.
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000 So open the door, guy runs in and then someone throws the crash in.
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000 So now you're crashing yourself.
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000 It's not that big of a deal. You've got to use to it.
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000 But what happened with one of his new guys, you know, that happened.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000 So the door went open.
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000 The guy went in and I walled the guy's running in.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000 Somebody throws a crash in there.
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000 They sees the crash and he runs back out of the room, which is not what you're supposed to do.
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000 So this guy was the tasky to commander. He goes,
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000 Hey, come with me down here.
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000 And so they walked down and he brought him into a closet in the kill house.
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000 And just sat in there and said, yeah, how's it going?
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000 And then just sat there in the dark and dropped like eight crashes at their feet and just bossing the guy.
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000 Because you realize you just got to get anoculated.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000 You know, you just got to overcome it.
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:54.000 So that's kind of, I guess my my theory here would be if you're afraid of fighting and altercations.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000 Go change the jitter if you're afraid of heights.
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000 Work on some rock climbing climbing. If you're afraid of the water.
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000 Time to swim. It's time to surf. It's time to get out there.
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000 If you're afraid of pull ups.
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000 If you're afraid of pull ups, do pull ups. If you're in squats, do squats.
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000 If you're afraid of public speaking.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000 Go speak in public.
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000 If you're afraid to start a business.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000 Start a business. Make it small.
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000 And on all these, what you have to do is you have to mitigate the risk and you have to ease yourself into it.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000 But you got to go for it.
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000 And eventually you will overcome that fear.
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000 But the hard part is you got to take that first step.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000 You got to take that first step to begin to anoculate yourself against the fear.
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000 Against the fear of the thing.
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000 That's in your mind.
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000 Because that fear generally is in your mind.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000 When you get up on stage, do you public speaking?
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000 People are not going to throw tomatoes at you and say,
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000 You're an idiot to get off the stage.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000 No. They're going to sit there.
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000 So there's nothing to fear.
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000 It's in your head.
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000 Hey, those flash grenades.
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000 They don't cause any damage to people.
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000 They're just, I mean, you don't want them next to your eye.
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000 They're loud and they make a big boom and they're explosive.
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000 But yeah, they don't hurt you.
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000 Generally, they days you.
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000 They've been, they've been days.
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000 They stun you.
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000 Yeah. So like what if I had one in like my pocket?
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000 And it went off?
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:26.000 Yeah.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000 You'd get a little, you'd get a little some.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000 Not an injured.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000 I'd get hurt not injured.
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000 You'd get, yeah, you'd get hurt not injured.
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000 Yeah.
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000 I could go lift or something.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000 Yeah. You'd be, you'd be sore.
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000 Yeah.
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000 Yeah.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000 I never let one off in my pocket.
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000 Yeah.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000 I always wonder about those.
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000 Because they're, yeah.
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000 All right. Next question.
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000 Okay. And podcast number seven.
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000 You answered a question which was essentially about how a subordinate might cope with a leader
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000 who wasn't competent.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000 Mm-hmm.
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000 So this person is interested in your thoughts on the opposite side of the coin.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000 For example, if you're that guy, quote unquote.
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000 Mm-hmm.
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:13.000 And you know it. How can you still lead a team effectively, given the lack of competence, given
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000 the lack of competence can undermine the team's trust and confidence in you?
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000 So, so this question is you are that guy.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000 Yeah.
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000 You're the guy that doesn't have the knowledge.
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000 You're the guy that's inexperienced.
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000 You're the guy that just got hired.
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000 That's good that you know it.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000 That's good.
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000 Right.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:29.000 Yes.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000 He's done a good job.
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:31.000 He's done a good job.
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000 By recognizing that.
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000 That's that is step number one.
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000 He's recognized that he's the guy that he's inexperienced.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000 He doesn't have a knowledge, et cetera.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.000 So this question, while it might seem like a tough question, it's actually easy
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:50.000 and you might think because competence and knowledge definitely are very beneficial
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000 for leadership.
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000 The knowledge piece and knowing the technical side of what you're trying to lead a team
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000 and but it is definitely not mandatory.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:06.000 Now, if you don't have it, of course, you should strive to get it because it will make you a better leader.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000 But in certain situations, there's times where you have to lead and you have to lead now.
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000 That does happen.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000 So what do you do and how do you lead when you're in that situation?
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000 And it's actually pretty easy.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000 You lead almost the exact same way that you would in any other situation.
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000 Humbley and with an open mind.
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000 So leadership is the same regardless of what you know.
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000 Think about it.
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000 Leadership is the same regardless of what you know.
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000 What you're going to do is you're going to gather ideas because you don't really have
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000 and you don't see.
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000 You're going to gather them from the other people, right?
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000 You're going to explore the different methods, right?
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000 Because you don't know any of the other methods.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000 So you're just going to explore and say, how would you do it?
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000 How would you do it?
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000 You're going to weigh the different courses of action.
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000 Because you're not sure which one is going to be the best.
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000 It's not going to be super evident, which course of action is going to be the best.
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000 You're going to listen.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000 Listen to what people are saying.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000 You're going to keep an open mind.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000 Any here what they're saying.
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000 You're going to show that you're a quick learner and you're going to listen and learn.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000 And how do you show that you're a quick learner?
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000 You show that you're a quick learner by being a quick learner.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000 And how do you be a quick learner by studying?
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000 So when it comes to when there's stuff that you should know,
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000 then you study it and you learn it and you prove.
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:36.000 And then you take all this information that you've got and you weigh the decision and then you make one.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000 And again, that's how you should be leading anyways, right?
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000 So, so let me ask you this, just because you know the most, right?
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000 If you are the most knowledgeable on the team, does that mean you're going to plan everything yourself?
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000 No, no, it doesn't.
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000 Does that mean you're going to make your decisions in a vacuum by yourself?
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000 Just, no, if you're a good leader, you're not going to do that at all.
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000 Does it mean you're going to make decisions and move forward without consulting with people?
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000 No, it doesn't.
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000 So all this means is that you're going to do all those things.
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000 You are going to get consensus from the group.
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000 You're going to get people on board.
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000 You're going to talk to them and see what their ideas are.
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000 And again, I shouldn't have used the word consensus because you can't always bleed by consensus.
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000 That can be that can become difficult.
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000 But you're going to listen, you're going to learn, you're going to talk to people about what you're doing.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000 And that's how you're going to lead again.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000 It's almost the exact same thing.
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000 The only thing that gets added if you are sort of a technical expertise,
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000 you can be a little bit more of a sanity check on, you know, let's say a plan that people are coming up with.
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:44.000 If, if, if we were doing a computer, you know, soft-wrenching engineering problem,
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000 I would not be able to add my technical expertise.
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000 But if, you know, for the computers, the engineers came to me and presented what their ideas were,
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000 I'd be able to look at them logically and say, okay, explain to me out and ask enough questions until I said,
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000 Okay, guys, here's what I'm thinking.
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000 I think we should go with, you know, method B or whatever.
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000 And the other people can kind of counter and then eventually we can make that decision happen.
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000 So if I had the knowledge myself, then I could make that decision a little bit easier.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000 And I could add a little bit of a sanity check, but it's not life and death.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000 And the other thing that's interesting is when you do have the knowledge yourself,
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:29.000 you can, you can actually come off as a note all, which is not a good leader.
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:36.000 So in both cases, whether you are the technical expert or whether you're not the leadership principle,
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:44.000 stay the same, be humble, be open minded, listen, learn and lead.
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:55.000 Last question, what is your greatest weakness and what are you doing to work through or around it?
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000 What is my greatest weakness, my biggest weakness?
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000 And that's actually a hard question.
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:12.000 Because when I think about it, frankly, I am nothing but weakness.
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000 I'm not naturally strong, I'm not naturally fast, I'm not naturally flexible.
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:23.000 I'm certainly not the smartest guy in the world.
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.000 And I get emotional over stupid things and I eat the wrong foods and I don't sleep enough.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:40.000 And I procrastinate and I waste time and I care too much about stupid things and not enough about important things.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000 And of course, my ego is too big.
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:53.000 But at the same time, my mind is too small and it's trapped inside itself.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000 But now that being said, I have a saying.
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:06.000 And you've probably heard me say it before, a person's strengths are often their biggest weaknesses.
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:14.000 And so that also means that their weaknesses can be their strengths.
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000 So me, I am weak.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:29.000 In all those ways that I listed, I am weak, but I don't accept that.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:37.000 I don't accept that I am what I am and that that is what I'm doomed to be.
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.000 No, I don't accept that. I'm fighting.
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:56.000 I'm always fighting, I'm struggling and I'm strapping, I'm kicking and clawing at those weaknesses to change them, to stop them.
01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000 Some days I win.
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000 Some days I don't.
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:10.000 But each and every day I get back up and I move forward.
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:17.000 With my fist clenched toward the battle, toward the struggle.
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:25.000 And I fight with everything I've got to overcome those weaknesses and those shortfalls and those flaws.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:39.000 As I strive to be just a little bit better today than I was yesterday.
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000 And I think that that about wraps it up for tonight.
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:53.000 And like we always say, if you want to continue this conversation or you want to engage in one
