It's called the divide I think it's called the divide I'm pretty sure it's like this weird Movie and some apocalyptic thing happens in the beginning and everyone like retreating this apartment building retreats to the basement Where the superintendent or somebody lives and this guy is uh He's like a one of these duels day prep her type dudes, you know, and and I think he even has a manual or some he wrote a man I don't know, so they all look at but it's everybody it's like you know Apprent a girl with their her daughter You know some dudes some you know, they got the broad cross section of society Exactly right That's so we've thrown them a curveball You know, but it's it's like I said to produce something that would be less usable by people in the man of that they want to use it Or make it a little bit harder to find like I said maybe not as many people can buy it because they won't find it I don't care I'd rather have the people that really want it get to use it the way they want to use it So they end up like killing each other and all these ways like certain people have certain assets So they can offer like value to this group, you know kind of thing and it's all within like who becomes a dominant group The dominant evil group is uh is he's just two friend guys The person who lives is just the one girl only one girl lives. You know, he has all the things all the psychological states in Learning I don't know either way if you don't know you're not on the program You don't even know what you don't know kind of thing. You know, like that's good when they do that because it really does give you a feel of like, you know, you know, it's a little thing. Yeah, and they have different kinds of leaves or whatever, but they have and really the point there is when people ask me and if you're wondering What get get go on the website and you can see whichever you know like if you if you're like hey, I want the Cadillac one Hey while you're on Amazon also you can get Jocca White tea which tastes good and will guarantee you a deadlift of 8,000 pounds Some other books you get on there are way of the warrior kid That's for kids that want to get after it or even if you want your kid to get after it You want to be smarter stronger better you want to eat healthier get him that book Awesome feedback on that book which is some of my favorite feedback is pictures of kids reading way of the warrior kid doing pull-ups I saw and doing pull-ups and doing GJ2 And doing flashcards and their little book reports. and I don't know you get kind of You know how like when you get like a new cool rash guard So he comes back to his, you know, like I said, I don't know what his civilian job was, but he was laying stones or pounding on an envelope, shaping metal or something like that. And he goes back, like I said, he goes back like a reserveist to his normal life, and when he goes back to his normal life, survives that way for a while, or lives that way for a while, and then he gets recalled again, going back to the book. In a way because it sounds, but this, that just what you said right there, this is because this seemed what like this seems like what Napoleon was like. Yeah, it's like what it was J.P. call it like in in unconsciously Come in competent or something like that. your feet right you know some people are barefoot all the time like my son It's barefoot all the time he can sprint on Jagged rocks with no effect. It's weird because you don't know Like who caused the bomb you know it all that so there's a group by a core mac macarthee called the road This is a book. why and you know I would go see some of those I go see physical therapists and I try and explain to them what's going on and they they try and overlay their their their they try and overlay their vision of my problem into me Like for instance, it makes no sense That Kipping pull-ups would hurt but dead-hanging pull-ups wouldn't right why does that make sense? I'm like cool, but you put it on and it's They just didn't work out Like I can't wear this because just how it fits and stuff like that was it baggy I like seeing little book reports Here's a member like when you do a book record report when you're seven years old It's kind of a big deal. I'm getting them From on it like I don't I have the luxury of getting like the good ones, you know I'm all spoiled Oh, that kind of thing anyway Back to the program if you're on the program, but you experience those days those moments of weakness And you want Jocco to get you through them help you through them like a little spot You're not gonna take over, but as a spot You listen a psychological warfare for your moment of weakness and it goes by Situation right way enough. That's a long story, but This with the tracks It is better because when you want to refer to you know like it's like It was baggy, you know, I was like I tried to make a joke because like if you have a baggy rash card Dude, you need to start jacking some sticks. So they're like start starting lighter and like so they need like 35 dude Yeah, so that's a good one get that for your joints Also Gees and rash cards a lot of times people when they start jiu jitsu and this actually this this was going on since the beginning People be like what geesh it again. They have the regular ones too, but I don't know man Once you have the design when you can't go back my opinion Not that I have any basis for comparison because I've never had the normal ones, but I've seen them in other gyms Used them before and it's not to say my opinion Also if you want to get this book the diary of Napoleonic foot soldier there you go Or any book set jockel talks about or Right author by the way we have direct links to all these books per episode on a website jockel podcasts.com You know like when you're out and you're like Here can remember that day when I was fully not injured You want to wear it and use it, you know you know I'm saying it's kind of that you get that you get them all the time That kind of stuff. that's where you can get Shirts our shirts, you know the podcast shirts just clean was read them all this stuff some cool ones on there Look at those and if you want something get something we also have women stuff on there With a lady troopers out there or The guys you know your wife Daughter sister mom Boom they've broken me up music my wife wants some shirts. yeah, and good food time Why I get treated like a real time yeah, it's kind of like you know all I don't know if you ever had a friend or something I'm like flipping it up where it lands on the back of my wrist and then it like pulls my shoulder back I'm like how do they do this? and I heard you know a lot of my friends have been to come No one talked about that stuff, you know They were hot sweaty for a long period of time with no showers and human don't humans are you you're not used to that You're not used to people are used to that. I remember back when I first started you'd see like everyone that was kind of like the thing start a clothing brand Start to get to month three start a clothing brand. that's the the movie essentially they just kind of omit all these details like that doesn't make sense That's why the movies weird but when you think about it that's what the movies about we should book Con Mac MacCart the the road on the website for people to Get along with the dire even Napoleonic foot soldier so people get this. So in feet and then now You know you come to the mainland where you wear shoes all the time and We don't wear shoes in the house and you know why that's a thing and so Yeah, quarantine But you have that opportunity for these guys You pick up some of that stuff in all these books what those soldiers are suffering through you know whether it's You know jungle foot foot rot trench foot So Sometimes I'd get the shirt and the designs are cool for the time they were cool, but then when you put on the shirt It doesn't like fit character, you know because when they got the blanks I mean he's only guys You know or different there's another little you know because it's French soldiers and There's some German soldiers that are on the same side, but what do you think happens when things go crazy?
