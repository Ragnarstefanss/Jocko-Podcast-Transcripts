and you know that if you get ambushed here which you're gonna do you're gonna break contact or you're gonna you know flank the enemy or whatever the case may be but you're gonna know what to do in a business environment it's the same thing there's times where instant communication isn't fast enough you know I actually see this when we work with like sales people and you know there'll be some hierarchy of adjusting product pricing and you know a client will come in or a customer will come in and and if that person if that front line sales person doesn't have the ability to make a pricing decision on the spot and say you know what sir I see you you know you've you've shopped us around and this is the deal you've got over there I can do here I can take care of you we can beat that price if you can't do that he's gonna lose you know if he goes let me check with my manager sure he could hang on to but there's a chance he's gonna lose him so sometimes instantaneous isn't fast enough you know it's gotta be it's gotta be quicker it's gotta be able to happen with no communications and that's that's what this is referring to it ought it ought then to be adopted as a principle that the columns of an army should always be kept united so that when the enemy cannot thrust themselves between them this is something that I always preached to my seal leadership and that is that separating your forces and sometimes you do have to do it the passage from the defensive to the offensive is one of the most delicate operations of war and I actually have a note of what I think is the most difficult operation of war and that is linking up under fire and again you know what now I'm talking tactically to two two people that are listening to the show that are currently serving in the military in the police linking up with other units other from the units under fire is one of the most difficult things to do because there's so much confusion people are shooting you're trying to bring friendly units together there can be bad guys in between you and obviously if there's bad guys in between you and the other good guys and you have to shoot at the bad guys that means you're shooting at good guys too your bullets can hit them so it's a very very very challenging thing to do so be careful when it comes time to link up under fire and you know what I think of when I think of this I think of when you see companies merge it's they're you know they're they're moving together and there's just it's a very challenging there's confusion there's a disorder there's a there's a merging of the chain of commands of two different groups so it's it's very challenging and so anybody that's going into some kind of a merger scenario you've got to recognize out of the gate that this is one of the most hardest military operations and one of the hardest business operations to do so you've got to be aggressive with it you've got to plan it you've got to be clear about it you've got to do it in a simple way don't think that you're just gonna merge two companies together So so aggression Definitely comes into play but For instance in a leadership position if you're completely aggressive all the time your Subordinance will not want to Communicate with you they want to debate with you they want to say hey boss I don't agree with what you're saying here because it afraid you're gonna go hey you don't know what you're talking about We're gonna go my way out of the highway that's what they're gonna expect so you can't be overbearing You know on the mat you can't exhaust yourself with aggression And that's one of the things you know that I think from Purple the brown belt which is you know your your Six to eight years in the game is where people start to calm down and realize that that aggression needs to be Tampered and control and people have to relax um And We could go throughout military history and find case upon case where I would tell you yes absolutely that commander made a wise decision to surrender and you know that's there are situations where that happens But I think the main point of this is that to have that out there To have that as a thing right right is not smart is not smart and you know Going in with MMA fighters and telling them like listen if you get caught in a submission don't tap Let it break If you get put to choke go to sleep just There's no submission you are not tapping Now I've said that to guys and I've had some guys get out of some crazy Submissions that they should adapt and maybe they got a little bit injured, but they got out and I'm also had guys get caught in like some devastating Submissions and then like oh, you know what okay, I'm gonna tap because But the fact that that attitude wasn't out there Right dancers you're not you're not gonna if you're not gonna know where you are and you're not gonna see how you evolve and when I work with businesses I use the same principles Businesses will go out and operate off of instinct Now you have to trust your instinct and you have to understand it, but you all have to track what the facts are You know I'd say like where you're metrics how do you know what you did Last year this time in Profitability how do you know what you did in sales but you know you always need to be close enough to each other to support each other so if you know you shouldn't be getting you're you and your element shouldn't be getting any further away from me in my element then we could be able to support you so what's the range of my guns what's the accurate range of my guns you know if I can shoot three or four hundred five hundred meters you know if you have eight guys now I have eight guys and now we're getting further than that apart that means I really can't support you so now we're alone and that's not how you want to be so again there's times where people have to take calculated risks but we always would say you know keep that keep together stay together as much as you can and and again this is it There's a you got to give a little leeway there if you jump into a class that's an advanced class You're not gonna understand everything you know and people ask me on how to get started on Jitsu and I tell him go immersion training Just like a language just get in there and start training and you're gonna get Destroyed at first and then you're gonna slowly learn and the next thing You know that's a fastest way to learn languages to get immersed in it and do the same thing with Jitsu Is the instructor Having fun. I don't know if people have that really interested in that I think a lot of times people want a formula and I don't think I'm gonna give out a formula because the formula is gonna be different for different people at different times and their lives and ages and Body weights and you know male or female they're just all so many variables and so this is again as a leader in a leadership position this He's basically saying look at the moment of combat all year young and screaming and trying to motivate people is too late The veterans like the veterans aren't gonna listen to you and their crutes that once the cannon goes off They're not here and you either so your main focus needs to be You know during the the non-fire fight scenarios that's when you get people with the mindset that's gonna drive them through these bad situations If you're trying to do this trying to encourage people during the during the firefight you're late Theme of the night nothing is more important in war than unity in command When therefore you are carrying on hostilities against a single power only you should have but one army acting on one line and led by one commander Does that even need Explanation not really Unity of command There are certain things in war of which the commander alone comprehends the importance Nothing but his superior firmness and ability can subdue and surround all difficulties This is the burden of command. I'm just a lost Animal out in the woods So you have to you know build these principles and like you said And I think there's a difference between Being a flip flop or like you know your hip politicians get you know, oh your flip flop or because you said you don't support kind of troll and now you and now you You do you do support it now you don't support or whatever or you do support Bring it in refugees or not so and people get to call the flip flop or and yeah say mustard is that so and so next one a well established maximum for is not to do anything which your enemy wishes and for the single reason that he does so wish okay that is pretty self explanatory don't do anything that your enemy wants you to do you should therefore avoid a field of battle which he is reconnoidered and studied you should still you should be still more careful to avoid one which he has fortified and where he has entrenched himself a corollary of this principle is never to attack in front a position which admits of being turned so one of the one of the the biggest pieces that I take away from this and this is you should still be more careful to avoid one which he has fortified and where he hasn't entrenched himself I used to give my guys warnings about this about these fixed positions that are entrenched and I wasn't talking about combat you know what I was talking about I was talking about debates because you there's guys in the seal teams that would lure you into some kind of a debate about let's say the strategy that the seal teams were using at the strategy the way things that they the way they thought things should be done and the thing is these guys would sit there and have this argument with amongst themselves and with other people and so they would they would have these kind of fortified positions on them and you roll into it and you're like you've got your experience That's what they do You know, privation I look that word up actually a state in which Things that are essential for human well being are lacking And that's what they do and You know for me You know, I was talking about like you know, I don't sleep a lot awake up early. yeah you got to be aggressive to be a leader You've got to be Because if you're gonna make things happen you've got to be aggressive to make things happen You have to make things happen, you know, I always say people like all they want to make money I'm like
