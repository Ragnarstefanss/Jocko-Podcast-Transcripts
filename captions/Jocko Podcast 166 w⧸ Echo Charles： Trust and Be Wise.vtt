00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.20
This is Jockel podcast number 166 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.20 --> 00:00:15.40
echo. Good evening. And we are rolling straight into part three podcast number three of

3
00:00:15.40 --> 00:00:22.96
these psychology for the fighting man. What you should know about yourself and others. So if

4
00:00:22.96 --> 00:00:28.56
you haven't listened to the previous two podcasts, they're about this same book and there's

5
00:00:28.56 --> 00:00:35.52
so much information that we split it up because it was going long. And this part, these

6
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:40.88
couple sections here are really what I was originally going to cover, but then I figured I'd

7
00:00:40.88 --> 00:00:50.72
covered all and next thing you know, this turned it into three podcast series. Cool. And this section

8
00:00:50.72 --> 00:00:58.32
is called the soldiers personal adjustment. And here we go back to the book in a

9
00:00:58.32 --> 00:01:04.80
democratic civilian army millions of men are suddenly abruptly thrown into a new way of life.

10
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.08
It is in many ways a tough life. Men used to going their own ways, choosing their own jobs,

11
00:01:12.08 --> 00:01:18.80
associates, neck ties, times for going to bed. Now have to follow military orders about all these things.

12
00:01:20.48 --> 00:01:25.12
Men accustomed to a comfortable litter of belongings around them find the bare

13
00:01:25.12 --> 00:01:33.92
neatness of police barracks hard to get used to. Those used to steam heat, warm shower baths,

14
00:01:33.92 --> 00:01:40.16
and breakfast eggs cooked just three and a half minutes at home. Maybe pretty uncomfortable when

15
00:01:40.16 --> 00:01:48.08
they have to put up with a bed on the ground and cold water for shaves. There is more over no privacy

16
00:01:48.08 --> 00:01:54.08
in the army. If a man oversleeps and his corporal dumps him out of his bunk, the whole company

17
00:01:54.08 --> 00:02:01.12
knows about it. If he looks at his girls' photograph a lot, they know that too. The business of

18
00:02:01.12 --> 00:02:07.36
living in a goldfish bowl and having to take rousing from his fellow soldiers is about the hardest

19
00:02:07.36 --> 00:02:12.96
thing for a sensitive recruit to get used to. That's a fact. So here we go. These are all just

20
00:02:12.96 --> 00:02:18.40
welcome to the military. You're not going to get to eat what you want to eat. You're not going

21
00:02:18.40 --> 00:02:22.40
to get to sleep when you want to sleep. You're not going to get to keep what you want to keep.

22
00:02:22.40 --> 00:02:28.88
Think about those personal freedoms that everybody cherishes. They're all gone. Even your privacy.

23
00:02:28.88 --> 00:02:34.08
When you get to, when I went to Navy Bootcamp, you go in the bathrooms, there's just stalls.

24
00:02:34.08 --> 00:02:37.92
There's no, I'm sorry, there's just toilets, there's no stalls. You just sit down next

25
00:02:37.92 --> 00:02:46.72
to everyone else and do your business. The privacy is gone. Not every man, of course, meets

26
00:02:46.72 --> 00:02:51.76
hardships for the first time when he goes to the army. Some of known hunger and cold and hard work.

27
00:02:51.76 --> 00:02:57.28
Some never saw flush toilet or a shower bath before they got to camp. Some never had a good

28
00:02:57.28 --> 00:03:04.32
square meal well cooked for them. The army is providing luxuries. That's true, too. Not probably

29
00:03:04.32 --> 00:03:11.68
it's definitely not as true now as it was in 1942 because in 1942 some people were still living

30
00:03:11.68 --> 00:03:16.24
out the bush here in America and there's a lot less people still living in the bush in America.

31
00:03:16.24 --> 00:03:22.72
There's still a lot there though. But farmer, lawyer, banker, sectionhand, college man or man

32
00:03:22.72 --> 00:03:27.44
of little schooling, they all must adjust themselves to an entirely new way of living, almost learn

33
00:03:27.44 --> 00:03:32.48
new habits. Young men may find it easier to make the adjustment than older men because they are

34
00:03:32.48 --> 00:03:40.16
ordinarily a little more flexible with habits a little less fixed. That's for sure. If you think

35
00:03:40.16 --> 00:03:45.20
you're going to join the military at some point, join when you're as young as possible. No attachments

36
00:03:45.20 --> 00:03:52.80
and I was so just dumb, I guess for lack of a better word, I just didn't care about anything. When I

37
00:03:52.80 --> 00:03:57.12
came in they're like, you we're going to shave your head, we're going to take all your silly

38
00:03:57.12 --> 00:04:03.68
stuff and like whatever. Take it away, I don't care. But most men can fit themselves into the new life

39
00:04:03.68 --> 00:04:08.64
and work without too much friction. Those who do not, those who do it most easily are the ones who

40
00:04:08.64 --> 00:04:13.04
accept the new life at once, throw off civilian habits with civilian clothes and put themselves

41
00:04:13.04 --> 00:04:17.28
wholeheartedly into becoming soldiers. One of the hardest adjustments come with a loss of contact

42
00:04:17.28 --> 00:04:22.96
with family and friends, the soldier who misses friends at home is slow about making new friends at camp.

43
00:04:24.40 --> 00:04:31.04
So there you go. If you are homesick, what you should do is make new friends. The army is liberal

44
00:04:31.04 --> 00:04:36.80
with furloughs as war permits for such homesick men when they first go into service. But the real

45
00:04:36.80 --> 00:04:44.56
remedy is not in heried trips home or long distance telephone calls. It is in building up of new interests

46
00:04:44.56 --> 00:04:57.28
and new ties in and around the camp. Yeah, when I left home, I left home. My god was gone and just that was

47
00:04:57.28 --> 00:05:03.60
that. One of the fears that many men have to overcome or just to when they first go into the army

48
00:05:03.60 --> 00:05:07.68
is the feeling that they may lose their identity, their freedom of individual expression.

49
00:05:08.32 --> 00:05:12.32
From revelated taps, there is little of any opportunity for the new recruit to do anything

50
00:05:12.32 --> 00:05:16.80
he is not told to do, whether he wants to or not, he must get up at the sound of the bugle, put

51
00:05:16.80 --> 00:05:21.92
on the prescribed uniform, March when he is commanded, standard attention when he is ordered and do so,

52
00:05:21.92 --> 00:05:26.72
even when with a mosquito biting him. No longer does he eat when he is hungry, you're going to sleep

53
00:05:26.72 --> 00:05:33.28
when he is tired. All conduct seems to be according to order. Is this really a fight for freedom

54
00:05:33.28 --> 00:05:39.20
and democracy? Of course it is, but conformity and discipline are necessary for the efficient

55
00:05:39.20 --> 00:05:46.96
operation of an army. And I will say this. It's only that strict during boot camp. I mean for the

56
00:05:46.96 --> 00:05:53.84
most part, during boot camp, that's when you really are every movement that you make is based on

57
00:05:53.84 --> 00:05:59.60
what you're being told to do. Once you get into the fleet or out into a battalion somewhere,

58
00:05:59.60 --> 00:06:06.000
it's definitely, that's not easier, but you do have more individual freedom. So you, some people

59
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.04
when I talk to a kid that's 16 and they are wet with their worried about. We know I really like to

60
00:06:13.04 --> 00:06:19.12
whatever. I like to surf and I don't want to give up surfing. You'll have time to surf if you're

61
00:06:19.12 --> 00:06:23.12
stationed somewhere. Join the Coast Guard because they're always stationed near the water, you know,

62
00:06:23.12 --> 00:06:33.76
there's an idea. Next, a soldier's worries. There is first the fear of death. It is best met by

63
00:06:33.76 --> 00:06:38.56
accepting the possibility of death as a natural part of the job and by being careful not to

64
00:06:38.56 --> 00:06:44.16
lose a sense of proportion about it. Again, it's weird for me to read this book because that's

65
00:06:44.16 --> 00:06:47.60
if you would ask me that before I read this book, that's what I would told you. You have to do

66
00:06:47.60 --> 00:06:53.12
as to be like, yeah, there's a chance I'm going to die. And if you're scared of that, you should try and get over

67
00:06:53.12 --> 00:07:01.04
it. And I think that the sense of proportion, that's saying, like, listen, okay, the world's not

68
00:07:01.04 --> 00:07:08.88
going to end if I die. No soldier is so important that he is justified in thinking the enemy is aiming

69
00:07:08.88 --> 00:07:12.72
every, oh, that's what they're talking about. This is the sense of proportion is no soldier is

70
00:07:12.72 --> 00:07:17.84
so important that he's justified in thinking that the enemy is aiming every bullet bomb and

71
00:07:17.84 --> 00:07:22.16
shell it out. Besides, there are great many men in the army and only a small proportion

72
00:07:22.72 --> 00:07:29.68
get hit in battle. And the greater part of those who get hit will live and get well earned relief

73
00:07:29.68 --> 00:07:35.52
from a strain of combat. After that, there may be a purple heart, decoration, and some glory.

74
00:07:36.64 --> 00:07:40.96
This is when we're start to lean a little bit towards propaganda. They're like, listen,

75
00:07:40.96 --> 00:07:45.84
you're probably not going to die, which that is true. And the amount of people that are in the military

76
00:07:45.84 --> 00:07:49.44
compared to the amount of people that go into combat, compared to the people that actually

77
00:07:49.44 --> 00:07:54.000
make contact with the enemy, compared to the people that actually get hit, it's a very small percentage.

78
00:07:55.36 --> 00:08:00.64
And if you do get hit, guess what? You got some glory in a purple heart coming your way. Don't worry

79
00:08:00.64 --> 00:08:08.48
about it. Yeah, like I said, this sometimes is leaning a little bit towards propaganda in a positive and

80
00:08:08.48 --> 00:08:17.04
true, for way. But you got to take it with a grain of salt as they say, back to the book and soldiers

81
00:08:17.04 --> 00:08:23.28
who have been through the worst of warfare are inclined to say that only a fool wants to live forever.

82
00:08:25.52 --> 00:08:30.24
They usually add the warning. But if you must die, make your death count for something. Don't

83
00:08:30.24 --> 00:08:40.96
throw your life away by taking need of this chances. So that's the old again. Some propaganda for

84
00:08:40.96 --> 00:08:48.000
you there. Hey, listen, man, only a fool wants to live forever. Let's go get some. And like I said,

85
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.56
there is some truth to that. Back to the book, sensitive men may also worry or feel guilty over

86
00:08:56.56 --> 00:09:01.60
killing enemy soldiers, other men in action. Unless they understand this worry and face it

87
00:09:01.60 --> 00:09:06.96
squarely, they may head into trouble because killing is the main job of a combat soldier.

88
00:09:09.36 --> 00:09:15.84
This is something people tend to forget from time to time. The job of a soldier is to kill people.

89
00:09:17.36 --> 00:09:21.84
From the earliest childhood American boys are taught that it is wrong. The greatest wrong

90
00:09:21.84 --> 00:09:26.24
to kill. This principle has learned so early that it becomes part of them. As boys grow up,

91
00:09:26.24 --> 00:09:32.000
they forget most of what happened in infancy and early childhood. Few people in fact can remember

92
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.48
much of what happened in their first three years. Yet they retain within themselves the attitudes

93
00:09:36.48 --> 00:09:42.56
formed during their their earliest years. They don't remember ever learning them. It seems as if they

94
00:09:42.56 --> 00:09:47.68
always felt that way. If a man did not learn that it was wrong to kill until he was grown,

95
00:09:47.68 --> 00:09:54.16
he would learn it then with it with his mind. And he would be easy to lay aside that rule

96
00:09:54.96 --> 00:10:03.28
when war or emergency makes it necessary for him to kill. But the don'ts learned in early

97
00:10:03.28 --> 00:10:09.76
childhood become the voice of the conscience in the adult. They seem to be absorbed rather than

98
00:10:09.76 --> 00:10:16.24
learned. And even though his mind tells a grown man that the execution of criminals is justified,

99
00:10:16.24 --> 00:10:21.76
his emotions may rebel. Then if duty forces him to kill, he may go ahead and do it. But

100
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:28.96
afterwards he'll feel a vague, uneasiness and anxiety. His conscience won't rest. Some men strictly

101
00:10:28.96 --> 00:10:33.68
brought up may even get sick at the sick at the stomach, at the sight of a limp, pathetic body

102
00:10:33.68 --> 00:10:39.60
of a rabbit that has been shot. The cure for the anxiety that results from this kind of conflict

103
00:10:39.60 --> 00:10:44.80
between conscience and reason is to understand it. Once a man realizes that the feeling is

104
00:10:44.80 --> 00:10:51.92
natural in men brought up as an average American to respect human life, this particular worry

105
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:57.36
won't haunt him so much. He may have a few bad dreams, but that won't interfere with doing the

106
00:10:57.36 --> 00:11:05.52
job ahead at disagreeable though it may be. Again, this is when we're we're trying to let people know

107
00:11:06.16 --> 00:11:10.88
that hey, what you feel when you feel like I don't feel like I want to go kill people,

108
00:11:10.88 --> 00:11:15.04
that's okay, we get it. Here's why you feel that way, you feel that way because you've been told

109
00:11:15.04 --> 00:11:21.04
it since you were a little kid, but you have to bring your reason into the problem and logically

110
00:11:21.04 --> 00:11:32.08
calculate that it's okay to kill people. Tough. This is this is this is trying to tell a

111
00:11:32.08 --> 00:11:37.84
generation of American kids that they're going to go and fight and kill the enemy. That's what

112
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:43.36
this is doing and even letting them know like listen, you may have a few bad dreams,

113
00:11:44.32 --> 00:11:49.44
right, and that is probably one of the most minor ways of explaining the fact that you are

114
00:11:49.44 --> 00:11:54.96
going to have freaking nightmares and cold sweats and they're they're down playing that,

115
00:11:56.88 --> 00:12:03.52
but they're letting them know that that's what's going to happen. So this is this is definitely

116
00:12:03.52 --> 00:12:11.52
a book called the psychology, psychology for the fighting man and they're trying to use some

117
00:12:11.52 --> 00:12:16.56
psychology here to get the guys in the right mindset where they can kill.

118
00:12:18.40 --> 00:12:23.20
Next, the healthy mind to be at his best, a soldier must keep his mind fit as well as his body.

119
00:12:23.20 --> 00:12:27.84
He must be mentally alert and accurately aware of his surroundings.

120
00:12:27.84 --> 00:12:39.12
He must shoulder responsibility willingly. He aimed accept the dictates of superior officers

121
00:12:39.12 --> 00:12:44.000
without resentment. That's interesting. They use the word resentment, not without question,

122
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.88
but without resentment. He must be able to get along with other men without undo friction and with

123
00:12:50.88 --> 00:12:56.64
mutual pleasure. It's important. Undo friction. Like there's going to be friction. You're working with

124
00:12:56.64 --> 00:13:03.68
other human beings. All other human beings are crazy. The marks of a man with healthy mind or personality

125
00:13:03.68 --> 00:13:07.84
are, and that's one thing this book continues to do well is it makes these lists.

126
00:13:08.72 --> 00:13:14.56
So here's the marks of a man with a healthy mind or personality. One, he uses his abilities with

127
00:13:14.56 --> 00:13:19.92
enthusiasm and satisfaction, although not always with happiness or full contentment.

128
00:13:20.72 --> 00:13:24.32
Okay, so hey, I might not be totally into this, but I'm going to get it done.

129
00:13:24.32 --> 00:13:32.24
You know, the best possible way too. He wants to do something worthwhile to pull his load and not

130
00:13:32.24 --> 00:13:40.72
be carried by others. It's interesting how a lot of this stuff is in full alignment with some Jordan

131
00:13:40.72 --> 00:13:46.48
Peterson activities, sometimes Jordan Peterson statements, right? Shoulder responsibility willingly.

132
00:13:46.48 --> 00:13:51.44
I think that's it. I think maybe Jordan read this book. It is a psychology book and he's

133
00:13:51.44 --> 00:13:55.60
a researcher. Maybe he read this book and started snatched good material from it. We're on to you,

134
00:13:55.60 --> 00:14:04.64
JP. But yeah, and even this thing, man wants to do something worthwhile. Jordan Peterson talks

135
00:14:04.64 --> 00:14:10.16
about that all the time. He gets along with other persons, including his superiors and those with

136
00:14:10.16 --> 00:14:18.80
whom he has a difference of opinion. Very important. How often is it we see people that I don't

137
00:14:18.80 --> 00:14:25.12
agree with your opinion? Therefore, I don't like you and I can't get along with you. So lame. So lame.

138
00:14:26.24 --> 00:14:30.16
I actually welcome people that have differing opinions than me because maybe they can teach me

139
00:14:30.16 --> 00:14:37.12
something. Maybe I can learn something from their viewpoint. For when he is disappointed or meets

140
00:14:37.12 --> 00:14:43.20
with deprivation or strain, he faces the situation with constructive ideas and a fighting spirit.

141
00:14:43.20 --> 00:14:54.48
Not with fear, rage, hopelessness or suspicion. So then he does not suffer from indet, indigestion,

142
00:14:54.48 --> 00:15:01.52
headache or pain, which, though not at all voluntary, may be produced by mental troubles.

143
00:15:01.52 --> 00:15:12.80
So that's how you meet like problems with good attitude, not with fear, rage and hopelessness.

144
00:15:13.52 --> 00:15:19.12
Five, he perseveres in the effort to solve a problem or complete a task in spite of the difficulty

145
00:15:19.12 --> 00:15:28.16
and disappointment. Check, perseverance. Six, he likes to give as well as take. Check.

146
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:34.40
You ever know those kind of people that, well, they say that they can't give, but they can't take. Yes.

147
00:15:34.40 --> 00:15:40.16
Yeah. Those people are in front of hangro. No, they never recognize it either. Yeah. And then if you

148
00:15:40.16 --> 00:15:46.32
call someone on it, like that, of course, it's denial denial. In a defensive way, which is exactly

149
00:15:46.32 --> 00:15:56.32
you're talking about. You are proving my point right now. Continuing on, some break down mentally

150
00:15:56.32 --> 00:16:01.44
because they are just not fitted for army life. They never should have been inducted in the first place.

151
00:16:01.44 --> 00:16:05.60
Physicians at induction centers, watch carefully for the signs of beginning mental illness,

152
00:16:05.60 --> 00:16:09.76
but nevertheless, some slip by and they actually go through a pretty good chunk explaining that.

153
00:16:10.80 --> 00:16:19.04
You're not going to catch every person that has a possibility of having some kind of

154
00:16:19.04 --> 00:16:23.76
mental illness. So someone will end up and you've got to be ready to deal with them. And those

155
00:16:23.76 --> 00:16:28.32
are the people that they say are fordumed to develop mental illness. But then there's people beyond

156
00:16:28.32 --> 00:16:34.24
them and here we go. In addition to those men who seem fordumed to develop a mental illness,

157
00:16:34.24 --> 00:16:41.60
there are other men who break in the army under battle conditions. These are real battle casualties

158
00:16:41.60 --> 00:16:46.88
just as much as if they had lost a leg. So this is interesting because we hear all these people talking

159
00:16:46.88 --> 00:16:53.04
about PTSD and whatnot. As if it's new and as if it was unrecognized, this book is written in

160
00:16:53.04 --> 00:16:59.68
1942 and they're saying, hey, somebody that suffers that kind of stress under battle conditions,

161
00:16:59.68 --> 00:17:07.04
that's a casualty, just like losing a leg. So there you go. Yeah, and that's the part that's kind

162
00:17:07.04 --> 00:17:14.16
of, well, seems anyway new is that it's just as traumatic as the physical damage. You know,

163
00:17:14.16 --> 00:17:19.76
like, and like you said, it seems new, right? It seems new, but this is World War II.

164
00:17:19.76 --> 00:17:25.36
Yeah. And we just don't we always have to learn the same lesson over and over again. Why is that?

165
00:17:26.48 --> 00:17:32.16
Why do we have to learn the same lesson over and over and over again? It's a horrible reality.

166
00:17:33.28 --> 00:17:37.52
Back to the book, a man in battle may receive a blow on the head that will cause injury to the

167
00:17:37.52 --> 00:17:42.08
brain. That is serious, particularly if he is a leader responsible for the direction and safety of his

168
00:17:42.08 --> 00:17:48.48
men. This is an interesting point. Since the brain itself has no sense organs, a man does not

169
00:17:48.48 --> 00:17:53.68
feel pain when his brain is injured and may think he has not been badly hurt. This is how we end

170
00:17:53.68 --> 00:17:57.92
up with guys with TBI with traumatic brain injuries because they don't your brain gets rocked around,

171
00:17:57.92 --> 00:18:02.32
but it doesn't it's not like a bruise. It's not it's not aching. I mean, you get a little bit of a

172
00:18:02.32 --> 00:18:06.64
headache. Once you want your experience a big blast like the next day, I wonder why I got a little

173
00:18:06.64 --> 00:18:12.88
headache. There's a reason for that. But even what seems like a slight wound in the head must be

174
00:18:12.88 --> 00:18:17.76
looked after carefully. Usually the wounded man should be relieved from duty. If even a small part

175
00:18:17.76 --> 00:18:22.08
of his brain is hurt or his head is received a hard blow which does not even crack the skull.

176
00:18:22.64 --> 00:18:26.72
Nevertheless, he's likely to be confused or to act in a peculiar way about it.

177
00:18:27.84 --> 00:18:32.80
So he thinks funny. It looked you got to blow it. Didn't even crack your skull. That's

178
00:18:32.80 --> 00:18:37.52
their assessment. It can't be that bad. It didn't even crack your skull. Even a guy that didn't

179
00:18:37.52 --> 00:18:44.32
crack his skull needs to get checked out needs a little break. Back to the book, a direct blow on the

180
00:18:44.32 --> 00:18:51.52
head is not the only way a man's brain can be injured. The blast of a shell nearby can cause harm

181
00:18:51.52 --> 00:18:55.92
to the brain. Modern helmets, however, protect the soldiers at yours and his brain very well.

182
00:18:57.20 --> 00:19:05.84
That's kind of rubbish. How the helmet protects your ears and our helmets, obviously, are even

183
00:19:05.84 --> 00:19:12.32
more modern than the World War II. Steel helmet that they wore. We stars are made a caviar

184
00:19:12.32 --> 00:19:16.000
now. That's not going to protect your ears. What we do have that protect your ears,

185
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.20
no, it's we wear a lot of people wear headphones for your radio and they have noise can't

186
00:19:23.20 --> 00:19:28.40
thing headphones. So that does protect your ears. Is it the kind that like go over your ears or

187
00:19:28.40 --> 00:19:32.88
inside? It goes over your ears. And there are ones that go inside your ears too, depending on what you

188
00:19:32.88 --> 00:19:38.80
like. But yeah, most of most people are wearing noise cancelling headphones that go over both ears

189
00:19:38.80 --> 00:19:47.28
and they pick up noise from the outside and they mute down. Yeah, really, now noise is. Now

190
00:19:49.84 --> 00:19:53.20
one thing that's when you're wearing headphones, those headphones on both ears,

191
00:19:54.72 --> 00:19:59.20
you lose, there's something that you lose. There's a couple things that you lose. You lose

192
00:19:59.20 --> 00:20:03.84
the ability to tell distance how far away something is and where it's coming from. And you

193
00:20:03.84 --> 00:20:09.04
lose the ability to tell where it's coming from. So if you see pictures of like me of

194
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:16.16
life of stoner most of the time, we have one ear on and one ear off. And and sometimes people would

195
00:20:16.16 --> 00:20:20.96
ask people see a picture of what it's you have your headphones. But here's why you want to be

196
00:20:20.96 --> 00:20:27.20
able to hear direction that someone's yelling for you and you want to be able to tell somewhat

197
00:20:27.20 --> 00:20:32.80
what the distances and those things are just gone. When you have the noise cancelling headphones

198
00:20:32.80 --> 00:20:38.40
on. There's their noise cancelling kind of go in your ears. There's no noise cancelling. Yeah,

199
00:20:38.40 --> 00:20:43.44
the ones that don't have for shooting do that. It has a little volume thing and also I don't

200
00:20:43.44 --> 00:20:49.60
obviously I don't know exactly how they made them to work but the it's like when a gunshot goes

201
00:20:49.60 --> 00:20:54.64
off, it actually mutes everything. So if I'm talking to you and a gunshot goes off like that

202
00:20:54.64 --> 00:21:00.88
for that instant use you go off too. That's the worst. Yeah, and the deal is true, you know, where

203
00:21:00.88 --> 00:21:06.96
it's coming from. So you could be over it literally on the opposite side. You know, it's crazy.

204
00:21:06.96 --> 00:21:13.68
Yeah, so for guys that are in the military or in some kind of law enforcement where you're

205
00:21:13.68 --> 00:21:18.32
where you're wearing those headsets just be advised. And I wouldn't go to the point where I'd

206
00:21:18.32 --> 00:21:22.88
cut that other headphone off. I would keep it. I'd just push it behind my ear and wear it that

207
00:21:22.88 --> 00:21:28.80
way all the time. That way if I needed to, I could put both headphones on because you can also

208
00:21:28.80 --> 00:21:33.52
run and this is another thing that's a challenge, you know leadership position as you can run

209
00:21:33.52 --> 00:21:39.60
two different radio frequencies one into each ear. And so when that's going on then you got two

210
00:21:39.60 --> 00:21:43.76
voices coming in at the same time talking about different things and it takes a little bit of practice

211
00:21:43.76 --> 00:21:47.44
to get used to that. And actually it's something that they say women are better at than men.

212
00:21:47.44 --> 00:21:51.92
Yes, you have read a test. Have you read that? Yes. Yeah, I read some

213
00:21:52.72 --> 00:21:57.12
research about it but women can listen to two conversations easier than men can listen to

214
00:21:57.12 --> 00:22:01.68
two conversations. But can they draw a bicycle? Well, we've been through this before.

215
00:22:01.68 --> 00:22:06.56
It was a risky, that's a risky conversation. It was the same study that or it wasn't the same study.

216
00:22:06.56 --> 00:22:11.04
It was a presentation. It was like a video with the article. It was the same one that said about

217
00:22:11.04 --> 00:22:15.60
the drawing the bike thing as the Karyanthus conversations or multitask in certain ways where it

218
00:22:15.60 --> 00:22:20.56
requires concentration on this stuff. Yes, they are. Yeah, that's interesting. That's why like

219
00:22:20.56 --> 00:22:26.000
my wife can literally be on the phone and like watch a TV show that you have to follow. You

220
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.56
know, like do that kind of stuff. And I'm like, bro, you can't watch this show and be like

221
00:22:32.80 --> 00:22:37.20
shopping for curtains at the same time. You know, like, you know, we're watching the show or we

222
00:22:37.20 --> 00:22:41.60
shopping for curtains kind of thing. But they can do that. So they have a little

223
00:22:42.32 --> 00:22:49.12
advanced skill there. So the modern helmets, they don't practice. They don't protect your head

224
00:22:49.12 --> 00:22:54.48
from a shell blast at all. Even our helmets today, they don't. Come back to the book besides

225
00:22:54.48 --> 00:22:59.04
these direct injuries to the brain, men in battle can suffer shocks to the mind. Every

226
00:22:59.04 --> 00:23:05.36
month, every man has his limit mentally as well as physically. There are strains which no man,

227
00:23:05.36 --> 00:23:12.72
however tough-minded, minded, can endure. Modern battle has pushed closer and closer to these

228
00:23:12.72 --> 00:23:21.04
final limits of man's endurance. Grueling hardships, great fatigue, prolonged loss of sleep,

229
00:23:21.04 --> 00:23:27.44
blistering heat, intense cold, high-altitudes, great pressures below the sea. These are all

230
00:23:27.44 --> 00:23:34.40
conditions that put a dangerous strain on the mind as well as body. When a man goes through these

231
00:23:34.40 --> 00:23:41.44
things and then an addition suffered the strain of seeing his friends killed, of being in constant

232
00:23:41.44 --> 00:23:47.36
peril of his own life, of dealing out death with his own hands, their may come a time when the

233
00:23:47.36 --> 00:23:59.12
strongest man's mind will sicken. Such a sufferer from war shock is not a weakling, he is not

234
00:23:59.12 --> 00:24:06.24
a coward, he is a battle casualty. If given psychiatric first aid promptly he will probably recover

235
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:14.000
to take his place again in the battle unit. If neglected, however, he may become permanently ill or

236
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:26.88
may even seek relief of his mental wounds in death. So again, this is 1942 and we still hear information

237
00:24:26.88 --> 00:24:35.28
about this nowadays like it's a revelation and it's not and you know, people trying to seek

238
00:24:35.28 --> 00:24:40.80
relief by committing suicide. That's what they're saying here. The seek relief from mental wounds in

239
00:24:40.80 --> 00:24:48.16
death. What is that? That's suicide. And also, and I think to me it's always Dick Winner's that always

240
00:24:49.36 --> 00:24:54.16
I always get reminded that he's the guy that would say, look, if you've got a guy that's getting close,

241
00:24:54.16 --> 00:24:59.12
you pull him off the battle line and you let him recover and he'll be fine. If you don't pull him off the

242
00:24:59.12 --> 00:25:04.24
battle line, he's gonna break, he's gonna be no good. It's the engine, it's the engine, the car engine

243
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:09.04
running in the red. The car engine is running in the red. You need to get it to a service station

244
00:25:09.04 --> 00:25:13.68
to get that thing serviced, give it a little breather and then it'll be fine. If you get an engine

245
00:25:13.68 --> 00:25:16.64
running in the red and you keep running it, guess what's going to happen? You're going to blow out

246
00:25:16.64 --> 00:25:20.80
the engine. It's going to be done. It's going to be ruined. Yeah, so it's kind of like when you kind of

247
00:25:20.80 --> 00:25:26.32
go down that path, when you think about it, you know, people who commit suicide just in general,

248
00:25:26.32 --> 00:25:33.76
you know, it kind of is like kind of got to think about that. Like they were probably in one or

249
00:25:33.76 --> 00:25:39.92
another injured, right, in their brain, whether it be, you know, for one way or another. I think

250
00:25:39.92 --> 00:25:45.28
you just, you can't just, when you say injured, we're not just talking about physical injury. We're

251
00:25:45.28 --> 00:25:52.08
talking about whatever stress, massive amount of stress, death, all seeing all this mayem and chaos.

252
00:25:52.96 --> 00:25:59.60
Yes. So, yeah, they have seen, you got to assume that someone that gets there in these cases

253
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:04.88
has seen something that's so bad or suffered through something that's so bad that they seek relief

254
00:26:04.88 --> 00:26:12.24
from these mental stresses in death. Yeah. So, even like a non-military person, where, you know,

255
00:26:12.24 --> 00:26:17.36
like it's common for people to be like, oh, you took these away out, the coward kind of thing,

256
00:26:17.36 --> 00:26:26.000
right, he committed suicide kind of thing. But if you do really, 100% regard it as an injury, just like

257
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.44
your arm or your leg or something like that, it's kind of like it seems like a little bit more

258
00:26:31.44 --> 00:26:41.12
understandable almost, rather than calling them a coward outright. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure

259
00:26:41.12 --> 00:26:49.20
about that. I think that, I think that the most important thing is to recognize that if someone

260
00:26:49.20 --> 00:26:54.80
hurts their arm and they keep going on it, their arm is not going to get better, right?

261
00:26:54.80 --> 00:26:58.40
If someone breaks their leg and they keep running on it, their leg is not going to get better.

262
00:26:59.20 --> 00:27:05.36
And if someone's got a got some massive amount of stress that causes a mental injury,

263
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.24
physical mental injury or mental psychological mental injury, either one of those, if they don't

264
00:27:12.24 --> 00:27:18.48
take a break and get some help and get some relief, then it's going to not work. It's going to

265
00:27:18.48 --> 00:27:24.40
break completely. And then they get to a point where this is what we talk about when we talk about

266
00:27:24.40 --> 00:27:29.12
being in a cloud and everywhere you look around, there's nothing but cloud. If you think you're

267
00:27:29.12 --> 00:27:34.80
stuck in this storm and there's no way out, that's where you end up. And you know, I, I think Peter

268
00:27:34.80 --> 00:27:42.32
T. Oppost in an article about a young woman who killed herself and I wrote something in response

269
00:27:42.32 --> 00:27:50.88
on social media, something like that's horrible to see, especially, I think I wrote something

270
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:54.56
along lines of, hey, that's horrible to see, especially with so many people that are fighting to

271
00:27:54.56 --> 00:28:01.12
live, you know, you think about people that have cancer or whatever. And someone wrote back to me,

272
00:28:03.84 --> 00:28:09.44
you don't understand mental illness. You know, you don't understand depression. And like,

273
00:28:09.44 --> 00:28:13.52
I responded back and I said, and then he kind of said, you know, it's not like that and I said,

274
00:28:13.52 --> 00:28:18.24
you're right. I don't, like I don't under, I don't, I'm not a psychologist. I don't fully understand

275
00:28:18.24 --> 00:28:23.84
what it's like to have this going on. And it's the same thing when we Chris Cornell from Sound

276
00:28:23.84 --> 00:28:31.36
Garden killed himself and I happened to be on Jill Rogan's podcast the next day and we started off

277
00:28:31.36 --> 00:28:35.76
the podcast we were talking about it. And you know, it's the same thing because what Jill Rogan and

278
00:28:35.76 --> 00:28:42.000
I was saying and we're not psychologists, we're saying it's got to be hard to dig out of that, you know,

279
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.28
go go swing a kettlebell, go do something active, which to somebody that's got massive depression,

280
00:28:47.28 --> 00:28:52.80
that just sounds idiotic. But to Jill Rogan and I forget a lot of satisfaction out of swinging

281
00:28:52.80 --> 00:28:57.84
kettlebells and doing the jitsu, it's like that sounds like a decent idea. It sounds like really,

282
00:28:57.84 --> 00:29:03.92
yeah. And so hey, that's, you know, of course you should I caveat that statement with,

283
00:29:03.92 --> 00:29:10.40
hey, man, I'm not a psychologist. I don't really know when I feel like I, when I feel like

284
00:29:10.40 --> 00:29:17.44
there's darkness in the world, I really like to do something physical. Tim Ferris said the same thing,

285
00:29:17.44 --> 00:29:22.80
get out of your mind, get into your body, like, okay, so that you have those conversations and

286
00:29:22.80 --> 00:29:29.52
you think, this is what I think, I can't change what I think, you know, this is what I think,

287
00:29:29.52 --> 00:29:33.28
someone could change my mind and someone could educate me, sure. But I'm just making a statement,

288
00:29:33.28 --> 00:29:40.48
hey, man, that's horrible to see. It's horrible to see, especially when there's people that have

289
00:29:40.88 --> 00:29:46.40
cancer or whatever and they're fighting as hard as they can to stay alive and someone else that

290
00:29:46.40 --> 00:29:52.000
doesn't have any diseases decides, you know what, I'm going to take my own life. I'm going to kill myself.

291
00:29:53.36 --> 00:29:57.68
That's horrible to see. That's my statement and someone you don't understand this and

292
00:29:57.68 --> 00:30:06.24
like, no, I don't, that's part of my point is no, I don't understand this. And so I will say this,

293
00:30:07.28 --> 00:30:14.56
I've seen how fragile the mind can be. And really, I should, I should refraize that,

294
00:30:14.56 --> 00:30:20.000
how fragile the mind is because I've seen people that seem to be going down a good path

295
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.64
and all of a sudden out of nowhere that path is they're gone. And that's like shocking.

296
00:30:29.36 --> 00:30:34.56
So one thing, I guess, I, the part that I understand is that I don't understand it and it's hard

297
00:30:34.56 --> 00:30:38.56
for me to relate to that and it's hard for me to understand and say, well, I could have seen that

298
00:30:38.56 --> 00:30:46.56
coming to know. Actually, I couldn't have seen that coming at all at all. So the interesting,

299
00:30:46.56 --> 00:30:51.44
the most interesting thing about this to me is this book is from 1942 and they're talking

300
00:30:51.44 --> 00:30:56.72
about the same things that we're apparently still discovering right now. Like that, sometimes you

301
00:30:56.72 --> 00:31:01.52
need a break from combat. Like that when you come home, you might be a little bit, you might have some

302
00:31:01.52 --> 00:31:11.20
nightmares. Like that, if you break mentally, it doesn't mean that you're a weakling.

303
00:31:11.20 --> 00:31:17.36
And band of brothers does a great job of that. The one character who's a total badass through

304
00:31:17.36 --> 00:31:21.68
and all of a sudden he just can't take anymore. And they go, okay, no problem. And Dick Winner's

305
00:31:21.68 --> 00:31:27.52
talks about it and he says, yeah, we no one lost any respect for that guy. The guy took his

306
00:31:27.52 --> 00:31:32.24
risks, he did a great job and then he couldn't do it anymore. And David Hackworth

307
00:31:32.96 --> 00:31:38.72
describes it as, hey, you people have a cup. And the cup gets filled up and when it's filled up,

308
00:31:38.72 --> 00:31:42.32
it's filled up. You can't put anymore in there. You can't put anymore combat in there. And it's not.

309
00:31:42.32 --> 00:31:46.64
Some people have a bigger cup than other people. It's no disrespect. It's not a negative statement.

310
00:31:46.64 --> 00:31:56.32
It's just that's the way it is. So if someone gets in these bad situations, what in my opinion,

311
00:31:56.32 --> 00:32:02.08
you have to do is take a break, get someone to help, get someone to talk to about it. That can

312
00:32:02.08 --> 00:32:06.16
help you find your way out of the story. That's what I realized from, from the times we've had

313
00:32:06.16 --> 00:32:09.68
speaking of of Jordan Peterson, the times that we the first time we had him on here,

314
00:32:11.60 --> 00:32:16.24
I had never really spent any time thinking about psychology as an actual

315
00:32:16.88 --> 00:32:22.72
possible thing the world. You know what I mean? Just kind of seem like voodoo to me, right? And then

316
00:32:22.72 --> 00:32:29.44
when he was talking through some of the psychological protocols that they use to come over particular,

317
00:32:29.44 --> 00:32:36.16
to overcome particular psychological issues, I was like, oh, okay. So this basically is like a

318
00:32:36.16 --> 00:32:41.04
car mechanic, right? You come in with to me and you've got this problem with your car. Cool.

319
00:32:41.04 --> 00:32:46.24
This is what we're going to do. It affects that problem with your car. And so there's a certain amount

320
00:32:46.24 --> 00:32:51.92
of psychology that was revealed to me from Jordan as like, oh yeah, this is when you have this

321
00:32:51.92 --> 00:32:57.28
situation, this is what you do to heal it. And so it's important that that was kind of a

322
00:32:57.28 --> 00:33:04.56
revelation to me, not like a revelation that changed my world, but it was a for me,

323
00:33:05.12 --> 00:33:08.96
psychology was just always kind of voodoo. That's what it seemed like to me looking at it from the

324
00:33:08.96 --> 00:33:15.04
outside. And I'm an ignorant person, right? Seriously. I'm kind of an ignorant person. I graduate

325
00:33:15.04 --> 00:33:20.24
in high school, I grew up in the military. I spent all my time around a bunch of other knuckleheads

326
00:33:20.24 --> 00:33:28.64
like me. It's like you're not talking this vast, with this vast experience of all these different

327
00:33:28.64 --> 00:33:33.84
data points of the world. It's like, no, I'm just a guy who never really dealt with psychology

328
00:33:33.84 --> 00:33:37.60
before. So for me, I just looked at, oh, it's just some weird people laying on a couch. You know,

329
00:33:37.60 --> 00:33:43.60
what I learned from the movies. And so I didn't see the benefit of, hey, oh, they actually have

330
00:33:44.56 --> 00:33:50.000
identifiable problems that they can see. And then they have protocols to overcome those. So

331
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.52
if someone is out there and they're caught in this storm, whatever that storm may be, if you go to

332
00:33:57.52 --> 00:34:03.44
one of these brain mechanics, if they would have called it brain mechanic, I would have understood it.

333
00:34:03.44 --> 00:34:07.60
Go to brain mechanic. They're called the psychologist. Go to a brain mechanic and say, hey,

334
00:34:07.60 --> 00:34:12.32
this is the problem that I'm having right now. Can you give me a tune up? And the brains, the brain

335
00:34:12.32 --> 00:34:17.20
mechanic will say, yep, here's the protocol. I want you to do this. I want you to write down this.

336
00:34:17.20 --> 00:34:21.84
I want you to talk about this. I want you to talk about this. I want you to talk about this. I want

337
00:34:21.84 --> 00:34:27.44
you to talk about this. And that's what they do. Mental danger signals back to the book.

338
00:34:27.44 --> 00:34:31.92
Mental first aid is just as important as physical first aid for preventing casualties and losses

339
00:34:31.92 --> 00:34:41.68
to the service. If a, and 1942, if a man can be relieved of duty for a time given a rest when

340
00:34:41.68 --> 00:34:48.96
he needs it urgently, he can usually be counted upon to come back to the combat presently with fresh,

341
00:34:48.96 --> 00:34:53.60
zest and vigor. If, however, he's allowed to go on past his mental breaking point without

342
00:34:53.60 --> 00:34:59.12
let up, if he is permitted to wait until he collapses or until the urgency of his needs makes him go

343
00:34:59.12 --> 00:35:05.12
on sick call voluntarily. The chances are much smaller for his rapid recovery. Check out

344
00:35:05.12 --> 00:35:12.48
World War I shell shock. And that's what you end up with. Guys that are mentally destroyed by

345
00:35:13.28 --> 00:35:21.60
the horror that they see and the unremitting nonstop presence of this horror. You have to give

346
00:35:21.60 --> 00:35:28.96
guys breaks if they need it. Next, the first thing to look for is anything that makes a man stand out

347
00:35:28.96 --> 00:35:33.44
in an awkward way from the others in his unit. Anything that makes him look odd to the other

348
00:35:33.44 --> 00:35:43.04
men, Marks him as not belonging. Does he stay by himself too much? Does he go for long periods without

349
00:35:43.04 --> 00:35:49.12
speaking? Is he known to other men as having strange ideas? Does he find conditions intolerable that

350
00:35:49.12 --> 00:35:56.000
other men get along under all right? Is he a problem in the outfit refusing certain foods,

351
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.28
wetting the bed, following strange or peculiar practices? Does the sergeant regard him regardless

352
00:36:01.28 --> 00:36:06.24
of peculiar? Another thing to look for is any sudden change in the soldier's own personality.

353
00:36:06.88 --> 00:36:11.68
If he is a man who has been in the outfit for a while, it's easy to, it's easy to note a complete

354
00:36:11.68 --> 00:36:17.76
reversal of habits or attitudes when the ordinarily cheerful man becomes moody and depressed. When

355
00:36:17.76 --> 00:36:22.32
the quiet or delish soldier becomes boisterous and noisy and a disciplinary problem, when the

356
00:36:22.32 --> 00:36:27.60
neat well groomed man becomes dirty and disheveled. Let's as shoes going shine. His uniform on

357
00:36:27.60 --> 00:36:33.68
button, his hair uncombed. When the dependable man goes a wall and starts drinking hard, these are

358
00:36:33.68 --> 00:36:40.48
signs to look for mental trouble. They should be looked into. The guardhouse may not be any help at

359
00:36:40.48 --> 00:36:45.68
all sometimes it makes things even worse. So just because someone starts getting in trouble,

360
00:36:45.68 --> 00:36:50.96
hey, you don't renew from him in the brig. That's not going to make things any better. In fact,

361
00:36:50.96 --> 00:36:57.44
it could make things worse. Back to the book, when a man has been through a particularly trying

362
00:36:57.44 --> 00:37:02.000
experiencing combat without relief for a long period, under steady bombing or gunfire without

363
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.64
protection cutoff from other troops or lost at sea, more cute signs of war nerves may show up.

364
00:37:07.28 --> 00:37:12.08
All men should know that these signs are the natural result of fear and war strain.

365
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:18.96
They do not mean that a man has gone insane, but they do mean that he needs care,

366
00:37:18.96 --> 00:37:25.44
rest, medical attention, and mental first aid. And here's some signs of that. Here's some signs

367
00:37:25.44 --> 00:37:31.20
of severe stress, inability to sleep, terrible nightmares in which the battles repeated over and

368
00:37:31.20 --> 00:37:36.72
over inability to eat, buzzing or humming in his ears, shaking his general weakness, weakness in

369
00:37:36.72 --> 00:37:42.000
certain parts of his body as the knees or the rest, disiness, peculiar feelings in the heart,

370
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.64
fluttering, pounding, skipping a beat, difficult breathing, relentless, combined,

371
00:37:46.64 --> 00:37:51.92
but let restlessness combine with a feeling of being penned in and overwhelming desire to push

372
00:37:51.92 --> 00:37:59.20
people and walls out of the way. Rest is the principle cure for these indications of war nerves.

373
00:38:00.96 --> 00:38:07.20
Rest and the care of a medical man who understands such cases and an understanding on the part of

374
00:38:07.20 --> 00:38:12.000
the soldier of what is wrong with him. These feelings are natural enough for anyone who's gone

375
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.08
through the difficult conditions of combat, but they are very frightening to a man who does not

376
00:38:16.08 --> 00:38:20.16
expect them even more distressing than the shells or bombs or torpedoes themselves.

377
00:38:21.28 --> 00:38:25.92
This is when it's important to understand what's happening. If you don't know why you're

378
00:38:25.92 --> 00:38:30.32
shaking, if you don't know why you can't sleep at night, if you don't know why you can't eat,

379
00:38:30.32 --> 00:38:36.64
or why you feel weak, if there's, why there's ringing in your ears, if you don't understand

380
00:38:36.64 --> 00:38:41.76
why those things are happening, it's going to be worse for you. It's just unexpected. It's

381
00:38:41.76 --> 00:38:47.28
unknown and we're afraid of the unknown. Officers who understand these matters can do a great deal

382
00:38:47.28 --> 00:38:52.96
to relieve the men's fears of war nerves and to prevent them by their own calm recognition of the

383
00:38:52.96 --> 00:38:58.80
fact of nerves and their costs. So hey, officers like, hey man, look, you just got you, you've been

384
00:38:58.80 --> 00:39:06.24
out here for a little too long. We'd even a little breather. How the mind protects itself. The body

385
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:10.32
has defense mechanisms. So has the mind. Touch a piece of hot metal and instantly you have

386
00:39:10.32 --> 00:39:14.88
with drawn your hand before you know what you are doing. If something flies towards your face,

387
00:39:14.88 --> 00:39:20.000
you shut your eyes without stopping to decide how to close them. These are natural means for self-protection.

388
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.80
When the mind is attacked by unpleasant ideas, dangerous fears, it too has a way of withdrawing

389
00:39:24.80 --> 00:39:30.08
or returning away and shutting out what cannot be endured. When you see a man of ordinary,

390
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:35.20
good common sense become strangely blind to facts, refuse to believe that his loss brother has

391
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:39.92
really been killed or refuse to see that he himself is to blame for a disastrous failure.

392
00:39:39.92 --> 00:39:44.96
That man's mind is automatically protecting itself from a truth so better that he can't take it.

393
00:39:47.60 --> 00:39:53.44
A little bit delusional. It might be dangerous even where it possible to convince him,

394
00:39:53.44 --> 00:39:58.16
convince a man of the actual facts. He might if compelled to face them commit suicide.

395
00:39:58.96 --> 00:40:06.48
That has happened more than once. In opposite refusal to accept the truth on the part of a man

396
00:40:06.48 --> 00:40:12.40
of ordinary good judgment is a danger signal, just as a fever of 103 degrees is a signal of a

397
00:40:12.40 --> 00:40:17.76
serious physical danger. Don't try to argue with such a man. He should be given a rest or a

398
00:40:17.76 --> 00:40:24.16
furlough from the duty in the strain. It is apparent that the mind is hard hit. When he is fit again,

399
00:40:24.16 --> 00:40:28.96
he will be able to see clearly once more. He will rid himself and go back to normal.

400
00:40:28.96 --> 00:40:32.88
Just as the fever pageant, patient does when his temperature goes back down.

401
00:40:32.88 --> 00:40:39.76
But as only when the mind's natural protective mechanism are used to an excessive or unreasonable

402
00:40:39.76 --> 00:40:49.20
extent that they point to a sick or exhausted mind, every normal man uses them daily to some extent.

403
00:40:49.20 --> 00:40:58.48
This is the way they work. It goes through a bunch of things that we all do. On a daily basis, normal people

404
00:40:58.48 --> 00:41:08.80
to deal with things. One, passing the buck. You see this every day when a man fails or is humiliated,

405
00:41:08.80 --> 00:41:15.60
he can shrug it off or freely admit his own fault if the failure is trivial and did not mean much

406
00:41:15.60 --> 00:41:20.88
to him or if he has strong character. If the failure is a great personal tragedy,

407
00:41:20.88 --> 00:41:26.64
all but the man of an extraordinary strength of character will try to put the blame on someone

408
00:41:26.64 --> 00:41:35.92
or someone else. Someone or something else. The man who thus fails will seize upon any

409
00:41:35.92 --> 00:41:43.76
plausible excuse. He blames the weather. The man who gave him wrong advice or the man who got in his way.

410
00:41:45.36 --> 00:41:51.60
Sometimes he may even imagine a plot against himself and persuade him that everybody is down on him.

411
00:41:51.60 --> 00:41:59.28
Humiliation and defeat are hard to bear instinctively every man wants to try it, wants to get out

412
00:41:59.28 --> 00:42:07.76
from under when blame hangs over him. Habits of good sportsmanship usually prevent him from doing so,

413
00:42:07.76 --> 00:42:12.88
but still in his own mind or among friends, he will say, but it wasn't my fault.

414
00:42:12.88 --> 00:42:24.72
That's an amazing section, obviously directly related to the idea of extreme ownership.

415
00:42:25.52 --> 00:42:31.44
The fact that it's only a man of extraordinary strength of character who will take the blame.

416
00:42:32.08 --> 00:42:37.44
That's the only person that everyone else is going to, I think what's important about this

417
00:42:37.44 --> 00:42:46.72
is to recognize that we all subconsciously know this. So when you screw something up and you go,

418
00:42:46.72 --> 00:42:49.36
well, you know, we didn't get to supplies where we were supposed to get and that's why we failed.

419
00:42:50.24 --> 00:42:54.96
Everybody knows that that's a little character flaw. You got right there to shine through.

420
00:42:55.68 --> 00:43:00.48
That's what's going on. It's a little character flaw. And you hear it all the time.

421
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:08.24
Yeah. It's so obvious to everyone when you're making an excuse.

422
00:43:09.44 --> 00:43:12.48
Well, it no one believes your excuse.

423
00:43:12.48 --> 00:43:17.04
You don't want to leave your excuse. Even if everyone's making an excuse.

424
00:43:17.84 --> 00:43:21.92
Yeah, there's a matter. It's still the subject. It's like everyone, let's say me, you,

425
00:43:22.88 --> 00:43:23.28
I don't know.

426
00:43:23.28 --> 00:43:31.04
Lave, there's a bunch of people in the room. And we're all making excuses. It almost seems like each individual guy

427
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:36.32
would be like, oh, they're making excuses. Meanwhile, like they're nothing, you know, I'm making it.

428
00:43:36.32 --> 00:43:40.72
Yeah. This is too, you know. It's a scary thing. And what's cool is as soon as someone goes,

429
00:43:40.72 --> 00:43:45.92
hey, you know what? This is actually my fault. Other people go, oh, man.

430
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:52.000
I need to say that too because I screwed some stuff. Yeah, it's kind of like,

431
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.76
you ever, you ever been in like a big meeting. And it kind of goes off the real little.

432
00:43:55.76 --> 00:44:00.08
It's a big news. You have a good. Wait, have you ever been in a big meeting?

433
00:44:01.20 --> 00:44:06.72
Where's your big meeting with like their wife? And your kids believe me. That's a huge meeting.

434
00:44:06.72 --> 00:44:10.40
Yeah. And then, you know, let's say it goes off the rails. And people start like,

435
00:44:11.20 --> 00:44:14.96
essentially raising their voice, maybe not yelling. But, you know, and now everyone's talking.

436
00:44:14.96 --> 00:44:18.80
You can't hear what anyone's saying, right? But everyone's voicing their opinions. Essentially,

437
00:44:18.80 --> 00:44:23.28
just, just a little bit more passionately, right? But you can't hear anybody. What anyone say.

438
00:44:23.28 --> 00:44:30.56
Right? You know, that happens a lot. So it's kind of the same concept. Because even when you

439
00:44:30.56 --> 00:44:35.76
are not saying anything, everyone else is talking, you're compelled to be like,

440
00:44:35.76 --> 00:44:40.72
be quiet. But, oh, what did you just do right there? You just added to the noise with the thing,

441
00:44:40.72 --> 00:44:45.68
rather than like handling it kind of consciously and be like, okay, I'm not going to add to the noise.

442
00:44:45.68 --> 00:44:53.28
I'm going to be quiet. Yes. Taking ownership is contagious and making excuses is contagious.

443
00:44:53.28 --> 00:44:58.88
They're both contagious. Yeah. And they'll both run rampant and wild until you put a check on them.

444
00:44:59.44 --> 00:45:03.68
The good thing, the good news about that is taking ownership is the stronger power.

445
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:14.64
So if you, if someone in that group starts to take ownership, that that virus will spread stronger

446
00:45:14.64 --> 00:45:24.16
than the excuse-making virus. Okay. The next thing that people do is the false front.

447
00:45:24.16 --> 00:45:29.04
When a man is worried by the fear, perhaps only half consciously but deep in his heart,

448
00:45:29.04 --> 00:45:34.56
that he has serious, that he has a serious fault or weakness. What does he do? He puts up a great

449
00:45:34.56 --> 00:45:40.24
show of being just the opposite sort of person. If the man is stupid or ineffective, yet feels

450
00:45:40.24 --> 00:45:45.28
the need to be strong and sure he will overdue his efforts to impress people. He will be loud and

451
00:45:45.28 --> 00:45:53.44
boisterous and cocky. The timid person may do full-hardy stunts, seeking to prove his

452
00:45:53.44 --> 00:46:01.52
bit bravery. The man who is really courageous, strong and manly, seldom he feels any need to demonstrate it.

453
00:46:01.52 --> 00:46:06.000
He just takes himself for granted. So there's a bunch of it. Obviously, we see this all the

454
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:13.28
people don't insecure about the way they do something they try and give the false front that

455
00:46:13.28 --> 00:46:19.92
they're great at it. I remember one was young and I bleached my hair blonde. There were a few times

456
00:46:19.92 --> 00:46:24.80
by the way. That's interesting. Yeah. So it wasn't like super long enough like this but it's just

457
00:46:24.80 --> 00:46:34.40
sure. And us, I was a girl who said, you just do that for attention and I'm thinking to myself,

458
00:46:34.40 --> 00:46:39.84
like, don't do it for attention. And then you thought to yourself more.

459
00:46:39.84 --> 00:46:44.64
Yeah. And then he kind of sticks with you. Am I doing it for attention? I'm not realizing it.

460
00:46:44.64 --> 00:46:49.52
Kind of thing. And then something, you go around and around and you're like, then why did I do it?

461
00:46:50.32 --> 00:46:55.68
Did I like how it specifically looked? Because it does stand out. I knew that from the beginning.

462
00:46:55.68 --> 00:47:05.52
Yeah. What ages is this? Uh, 2020, 2020. Yeah. 21. Maybe. Yeah. Like 20. Okay.

463
00:47:05.92 --> 00:47:12.40
So yeah. Yeah. I'm saying anyway. So after you think about it, you're like, yeah, because, you know,

464
00:47:12.40 --> 00:47:20.24
I like how it looked at the time. And yeah, I wanted people to sort of look, you know.

465
00:47:20.24 --> 00:47:26.24
It was like, and so then what did you do? I don't know nothing. You kept, I admitted it to myself.

466
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:31.44
Yeah. Yeah. I kept it. Okay. And then yeah. There's a lot of, there's a lot of wrestlers,

467
00:47:31.44 --> 00:47:35.76
like the high school wrestlers that do that. There's whole teams. Yeah.

468
00:47:35.76 --> 00:47:41.28
Whole teams. Everyone's got their their beach blonde. Yeah. Well, there's a level of arrogance

469
00:47:41.28 --> 00:47:45.84
which with wrestling. Yeah. Like, like, like, like, well, yeah, like self confidence, like, hey,

470
00:47:45.84 --> 00:47:50.24
I'm going to, right? We're going to make this happen. And it's, it's a psychological game, right?

471
00:47:50.24 --> 00:47:56.88
Yeah. I'm not scared of you. Look at me. I actually blonde my hair. Look at me. Yeah.

472
00:47:56.88 --> 00:48:02.48
Because I'm about to stick you on the mat. Yeah. Okay. So other than some antics,

473
00:48:02.48 --> 00:48:08.08
is there a difference between the expression I want attention or I'm doing it for attention versus

474
00:48:08.08 --> 00:48:12.96
I'm doing it to stand out. I think those are the same, right? Yeah. But one kind of sounds

475
00:48:12.96 --> 00:48:18.72
more like kind of superficial. Yes. Yes. You just want attention. Yeah. No, I'm doing it to stand out.

476
00:48:18.72 --> 00:48:22.000
You know, I want to stand out. That's a good thing to stand up. You know. That's, that's a,

477
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.40
not a great argument. Wait. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. But I do see that being, being,

478
00:48:26.40 --> 00:48:32.08
hey, I just want to stand out. That's the most positive possible way of saying,

479
00:48:32.08 --> 00:48:36.72
yeah, I just want attention. Yeah. Which is what you want. Yeah. Because if you say, I want to

480
00:48:36.72 --> 00:48:45.68
stand out because you can try to stand out or pursue standing out as a good thing for a good reason.

481
00:48:45.68 --> 00:48:50.88
You know, like I want to stand out. I want my business to stand out. I want my XYZ thing to stand out.

482
00:48:50.88 --> 00:48:55.60
So, you know, so people don't know sign on or whatever. But if you're like, I want to do it for

483
00:48:55.60 --> 00:48:59.52
attention. It just sounds like I just want the attention. Like that's what I want. That's the

484
00:48:59.52 --> 00:49:03.60
end goal of the attention. That's what it feels like when you say it, even though they're

485
00:49:03.60 --> 00:49:07.44
sort of the same thing, they're all the same thing. I was playing soccer when I was a kid.

486
00:49:09.20 --> 00:49:16.48
And my dad, my parents were school teachers. Yeah. They're not a lot of money in school teaching.

487
00:49:17.92 --> 00:49:26.08
And my dad, I needed a pair of cleats. So I'm probably eight years old. And my dad goes to the

488
00:49:26.08 --> 00:49:35.28
sporting good store digs into the the bin of leftovers second hand, whatever. And he gets

489
00:49:35.28 --> 00:49:42.32
and the pair of cleats that fit me is white. It's a pair of white cleats. Yeah. This is 19

490
00:49:42.32 --> 00:49:50.64
whatever. 78. There's no one with white cleats. This is not for everyone has black cleats. So

491
00:49:50.64 --> 00:49:56.72
I go to the soccer game. And like I said, I think with your white cleats. Yeah, that's all I got.

492
00:49:56.72 --> 00:50:01.52
My cleats. Yeah, because they were the cheap. They went in the the bargain bin. Right. It wasn't

493
00:50:01.52 --> 00:50:06.80
like my dad on the school teacher salary was like, hey, which paired you want from the easiest

494
00:50:06.80 --> 00:50:13.36
rack over here. No, you're getting the the new buck. You know what that is? No, it's a fake leather.

495
00:50:13.36 --> 00:50:16.88
You know, so you're just getting the fake leather plastic cleats, they're white, whatever.

496
00:50:16.88 --> 00:50:27.52
But I was out on the soccer pitch. And I think I want to say I scored a goal. I think

497
00:50:28.96 --> 00:50:38.80
and as I was running back, like a dad from the other team said something like, you know,

498
00:50:39.68 --> 00:50:45.12
you think you're the big star now with those white cleats. I don't know if he was being nice,

499
00:50:45.12 --> 00:50:52.08
oh, I said, he might have been being nice. It didn't sound like it to me at the time. I think that

500
00:50:52.08 --> 00:50:58.56
right there was like the beginning of me thinking, I don't want to be the guy that's dying their

501
00:50:58.56 --> 00:51:07.52
hair bright blonde at 21 years old. But yeah, you said maybe 21. You're going to be, you think

502
00:51:07.52 --> 00:51:10.96
you're going to be the big star now. He said something with those white cleats. It was something like that.

503
00:51:10.96 --> 00:51:17.04
Yeah, I can't remember very much from my childhood. Yeah. That I remember when you were playing

504
00:51:17.04 --> 00:51:22.08
like the, this is not some big soccer. You know, they got kids playing soccer now. They got,

505
00:51:22.64 --> 00:51:26.80
they're looking like a professional soccer. No, this is, you remember the things you had when

506
00:51:26.80 --> 00:51:32.40
you were a little kid that yellow shirt that was like elastic around the bottom and you just put it

507
00:51:32.40 --> 00:51:36.88
on over your other shirts. It was like the yellow team versus the other. Yeah, it was one of those things.

508
00:51:36.88 --> 00:51:43.36
Right? They were not talking high level. We're not talking high level soccer playing. We're talking

509
00:51:43.36 --> 00:51:49.92
yellow jersey. Yellows against the regular kids. Yeah, when they got intramuery or something. So there

510
00:51:49.92 --> 00:51:54.48
I was with the white cleats on it. I remember thinking that guy thinks that I'm trying to make

511
00:51:54.48 --> 00:52:00.40
a spectacular lot of myself. And you didn't say nice goal. Right. He said, oh, you think you got some nice

512
00:52:00.40 --> 00:52:06.64
cleats. Yeah. Well, you celebrating all hard or something or you know, running back. I was running back.

513
00:52:06.64 --> 00:52:10.48
Yeah, yeah, he was hating. I'm trying to think of when I celebrated hard.

514
00:52:11.68 --> 00:52:16.08
Because that's something that that's something I remember a couple times in my life celebrating hard

515
00:52:16.08 --> 00:52:19.84
and being like, man, that was a bad move. And again, it's probably the same age group, you know.

516
00:52:19.84 --> 00:52:26.48
Like, yeah, I'm swear. Man, that's kind of deep though where that the, because it's the opposing

517
00:52:26.48 --> 00:52:31.92
teams dad or, you know, somebody on their own. Because yeah, I wonder, right? Because there's two

518
00:52:31.92 --> 00:52:35.52
things that he could mean he was hating regardless. He was like, man, you know, he's sort of the

519
00:52:35.52 --> 00:52:40.24
goal, obviously. But it, but was he like, oh, you think you're the big shot now, like hating on

520
00:52:40.24 --> 00:52:45.04
that's what I heard. I think you're cool or was he hating like on a deeper level where he was like,

521
00:52:45.04 --> 00:52:49.36
oh, you think you're a big shot? Oh, look, you're, it's a piece of chalk. Kind of think was he saying that.

522
00:52:49.92 --> 00:52:57.04
The way I interpreted it is it was he was saying, you think your special. I got those white cleats on

523
00:52:57.04 --> 00:52:59.68
yeah, like you know that. Yeah, like you know that. Yeah, more than the only cleats I got.

524
00:52:59.68 --> 00:53:05.28
Yeah, because my dad is a notoriously cheap guy. My dad. We could tell stories about my dad.

525
00:53:05.28 --> 00:53:13.52
All, all 10, 15 podcasts worth of penny pinching. Come from the old man. So you weren't getting these

526
00:53:13.52 --> 00:53:18.80
normal cleats. Yeah. These are bargain bin cleats. So that's what we're talking about. This.

527
00:53:21.12 --> 00:53:26.08
Number three taking it out on the dog. The man who suffers injury and is not strong enough to hit back.

528
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:31.12
Made literally take it out on the dog or made go around looking for trouble with someone else.

529
00:53:31.12 --> 00:53:39.20
He can talk back to her punch in the in the nose. Yeah, check. Here's one borrowed virtue.

530
00:53:39.76 --> 00:53:45.76
A more constructive or helpful sort of mental protection mechanism is this action of a man who feels

531
00:53:45.76 --> 00:53:50.96
weak or inadequate by himself and who gains a feeling of strength and superiority by attaching himself

532
00:53:50.96 --> 00:53:57.84
to a stronger man or a strong group. It was this that sent so many men to their recruiting

533
00:53:57.84 --> 00:54:02.96
stations on the morning after Pearl Harbor as a man alone. You feel powerless in the face of threatening

534
00:54:02.96 --> 00:54:10.80
dangers. As a United States soldier, you know you can go anywhere in the world, avenge wrongs and protect

535
00:54:10.80 --> 00:54:18.24
your treasured way of life. So that there's a positive way that we week, we roll. Number five is sick

536
00:54:18.24 --> 00:54:24.24
call. When your mind is called upon to face something you dread terribly, your body may come

537
00:54:24.24 --> 00:54:30.56
promptly to your rescue. The aviation student who really dreads to go up for his first solo,

538
00:54:30.56 --> 00:54:36.96
feeling sure he is going to crack up his plane may develop a convenient but real headache on that day.

539
00:54:38.48 --> 00:54:44.16
Yeah, you see that happen, right? Oh, feel good. You speak with happened with little kids too.

540
00:54:44.16 --> 00:54:49.36
First, you get two tournament. I think I'm sick. First, whatever, you know, first,

541
00:54:49.36 --> 00:54:53.76
basketball game, I don't feel good. Shut up, you feel fine.

542
00:54:58.32 --> 00:55:08.000
Moving on, the war within the man. It might be much easier to defeat the enemy if men could only

543
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.68
win in some way the conflicts that very often go in, go on within themselves.

544
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:23.76
A man, so this is where we go dichotomy. The new level of dichotomy, be digging in right here.

545
00:55:23.76 --> 00:55:31.76
A man so often wants to do two opposite things at the same time and he wants desperately to do

546
00:55:31.76 --> 00:55:40.24
both. He wants to dominate other men and yet be liked by them. He wants to give vent to his

547
00:55:40.24 --> 00:55:44.80
anger but he doesn't want to get in hot water. He wants to gain promotion but he doesn't want to do all the

548
00:55:44.80 --> 00:55:50.32
hard work. Above all, he wants to be a brave and true soldier to keep the soldier's faith

549
00:55:51.28 --> 00:55:58.56
and yet he wants to live. How to be brave and safe? That is the greatest psychological problem

550
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:06.32
for the soldier. Most of the war neurosis, mental illness in parentheses, result from the failure of

551
00:56:06.32 --> 00:56:13.20
men to find any sort of satisfactory way out of that dilemma. Every man is equipped with two kinds of

552
00:56:13.20 --> 00:56:22.08
the deep-seated desires or instincts. Often these two conflict, one set has to do with his relations

553
00:56:22.08 --> 00:56:28.24
with other men. He wants to be one of the gang, appreciated and admired by others and he even

554
00:56:28.24 --> 00:56:33.60
likes to sacrifice himself for the good of the group to which he belongs, whether it is his family,

555
00:56:33.60 --> 00:56:41.84
church, army, or nation. But he also has another set of desires that cannot ever be entirely denied.

556
00:56:41.84 --> 00:56:45.84
Desires connected with himself, his life has comforted his personal freedom.

557
00:56:47.60 --> 00:56:54.08
No amount of patriotic fervor can wholly kill or drown out the calls of the more personal instincts.

558
00:56:54.64 --> 00:57:01.60
Only a few, rushed to enlist with no misgivings, most for most men, there is some concern or

559
00:57:01.60 --> 00:57:07.84
distress in making the decision to leave home family and job in order to join the service of the country.

560
00:57:09.60 --> 00:57:16.40
A move to a war theater and an advanced to close contact with the enemy usually brings a crisis

561
00:57:16.40 --> 00:57:21.68
in the battle within the soldier as well as in the battle against the enemy. When a man finds

562
00:57:21.68 --> 00:57:27.20
himself close indeed to death, then his instinct to self-preservation, one of the most powerful

563
00:57:27.20 --> 00:57:33.52
urges every normal man has, makes every fiber of his being protest against facing the danger.

564
00:57:34.80 --> 00:57:41.28
Yet his comrades, his officers, his country, are all counting on him to do his bit, a pretty big

565
00:57:41.28 --> 00:57:45.44
bit risking his own life, yet they are counting on him.

566
00:57:47.12 --> 00:57:53.76
If the personal instincts win the struggle, the man, when contact with the enemy forces is made,

567
00:57:53.76 --> 00:58:00.56
will run away or will surrender. If the social instincts prevail, then he is the stuff of which

568
00:58:00.56 --> 00:58:06.80
all good soldiers, all heroes are made. Most men who have traveled the hard path of army life up to

569
00:58:06.80 --> 00:58:12.80
the front lines, put up a good fight once they get there. For a few, so you there you go, you

570
00:58:12.80 --> 00:58:17.04
either have guys at good, okay, you know what, of course I want to stay alive, but I'm going to be

571
00:58:17.04 --> 00:58:24.08
loyal to my country, my army, my team that I'm with and the guide of my left and my right, and so

572
00:58:24.08 --> 00:58:30.48
guess what, I'm going forward into the fray. The other that make the other decision art world, you know

573
00:58:30.48 --> 00:58:35.44
what, I want to stay alive so I'm going to run away. So there's two distinct types of behaviors.

574
00:58:36.24 --> 00:58:39.36
Most of the time, it's hey, we're going to put up the good fight occasionally, it's a coward.

575
00:58:40.24 --> 00:58:44.64
And then this is the interesting one. For a few, however, this struggle ends in a stalemate,

576
00:58:44.64 --> 00:58:51.28
a compromise. That is what a war neurosis is, a compromise of this internal conflict.

577
00:58:51.28 --> 00:58:56.88
If a man goes on being torn by his conflict and desires, if he cannot bring himself to go forward,

578
00:58:56.88 --> 00:59:02.24
yet his two conscientious to give up, he will suffer from the type of neurosis characterized by

579
00:59:02.24 --> 00:59:08.16
anxiety. He finds he can no longer concentrate. He becomes confused. The expression on his face is

580
00:59:08.16 --> 00:59:13.04
pulse rate. His rapid breathing betray the fierce battle going on with him, within him.

581
00:59:13.04 --> 00:59:17.84
He himself may not be fully aware of the cause of this terrible sense of fear and horror that

582
00:59:17.84 --> 00:59:24.64
seems to hang over him, yet he is in a way solving his problem. He is making himself too inefficient

583
00:59:24.64 --> 00:59:30.24
to continue to fight, yet giving himself so much suffering that his conscious cannot accuse him of

584
00:59:30.24 --> 00:59:38.32
taking the easy way out. Yet even so, he does not know that he is doing all this, his nervous system

585
00:59:38.32 --> 00:59:44.08
does it for him. The man who suffers in any of these ways is not to be blamed. He is not a coward.

586
00:59:44.08 --> 00:59:48.88
If he were, he would have no conflict. That is an interesting point. So if you are just a coward,

587
00:59:48.88 --> 00:59:53.60
you are just like screw it. I am out of here. But the guy that frees his up and gets so nervous. He

588
00:59:53.60 --> 00:59:57.20
doesn't want to run, but he doesn't want to go fight. He can't solve that conflict in his head.

589
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.24
Back to the book. If he were, he would have no conflict. He would see to it that he was not at

590
01:00:04.24 --> 01:00:09.28
the front, but in a soft, safe job somewhere out of good distance. If necessary, he would

591
01:00:09.28 --> 01:00:17.92
desert. But he does not desert and still does not fight. He compromises with a difficult, unpleasant

592
01:00:17.92 --> 01:00:24.72
alternative. One which he does not choose, but which his nervous system chooses for him. He cannot

593
01:00:24.72 --> 01:00:30.08
control it. The leader who lectures him, balls him out, or punishes him from neglect of duty,

594
01:00:30.08 --> 01:00:35.84
is only to increase his trouble. On the other hand, coddling such men is a mistake too. So you

595
01:00:35.84 --> 01:00:39.76
can't go to, you got a balance. You can't go super hard on them, but you can't coddle me either.

596
01:00:41.04 --> 01:00:46.32
You need to balance this dichotomy. What they need is understanding help. The reinsert reassurance

597
01:00:46.32 --> 01:00:51.28
that comes from a firm, but friendly attitude on the part of those who deal with them. They need

598
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:57.12
the encouragement of assurance that such things happen to the best of men, but that men make it over

599
01:00:57.12 --> 01:01:03.12
such difficulties with aid. They need to be told that they will be helped by a good night's sleep,

600
01:01:03.12 --> 01:01:09.76
perhaps drug induced by the medical officer, by a good meal, and by rest. And that then they will

601
01:01:09.76 --> 01:01:18.32
be expected to return to the fight and do their duty with the others. So that's a pretty interesting

602
01:01:19.68 --> 01:01:24.64
way of looking at it. And I would say, as I thought about that, think about how many

603
01:01:24.64 --> 01:01:32.16
how much nervousness you feel. If you think about the nervousness is actually in internal war

604
01:01:32.16 --> 01:01:37.92
between two decisions that you could be making, right? What should I do? Should I buy this new car or

605
01:01:37.92 --> 01:01:42.08
save the money? Right? Like, what you want to do? Well, I really want the car, but I know it should

606
01:01:42.08 --> 01:01:47.12
save money. You get this little internal conflict, and that's what the struggle is. You're not

607
01:01:47.12 --> 01:01:50.88
really actually nervous about buying the new car. You're not nervous about saving money. You're

608
01:01:50.88 --> 01:01:55.12
nervous. You can't make a decision based on the two things that you want to make happen.

609
01:01:55.92 --> 01:02:03.04
So we get those little, I think if you frame things up, if you're feeling stressed about something,

610
01:02:03.04 --> 01:02:08.40
if you frame up, what is actually stressing you out? There's a good chance that what's actually

611
01:02:08.40 --> 01:02:13.28
stressing you out is you're just trying to figure out which decision to make. Yeah. That is true.

612
01:02:13.28 --> 01:02:18.88
And one thing that you can do is you can, if you play your car, if your brain plays the game out,

613
01:02:18.88 --> 01:02:21.32
you can be so you cannot make a decision.

614
01:02:21.32 --> 01:02:22.16
Oh yeah.

615
01:02:22.16 --> 01:02:24.36
Because hey, you're just not making a decision.

616
01:02:24.36 --> 01:02:25.20
Oh.

617
01:02:25.20 --> 01:02:26.60
It's like that.

618
01:02:26.60 --> 01:02:28.92
It's crazy how they, I mean, that's the first

619
01:02:28.92 --> 01:02:31.24
I've heard even when articulate that little bit

620
01:02:31.24 --> 01:02:36.24
because Bra will get that in the most stupid mundane things.

621
01:02:36.24 --> 01:02:39.84
So, okay, bear with me.

622
01:02:39.84 --> 01:02:41.64
So I'm unloved.

623
01:02:41.64 --> 01:02:42.84
Oh, I'm unloved.

624
01:02:42.84 --> 01:02:45.12
I'm unloved in the dishwasher.

625
01:02:45.12 --> 01:02:48.16
So on this side of my kitchen, which is like,

626
01:02:48.16 --> 01:02:50.000
it's kind of a longer kind of kitchen.

627
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.80
Where I'm so on this side, this is where pots go.

628
01:02:52.80 --> 01:02:54.08
But this is not just pots.

629
01:02:54.08 --> 01:02:56.16
It's pots and then certain kind of little these little

630
01:02:56.16 --> 01:02:57.44
soy sauce dishes.

631
01:02:57.44 --> 01:03:00.08
And then on this side is like silverware.

632
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:02.000
And then there's like plates.

633
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.72
So I'm unloading the dishwasher and I'm trying to be

634
01:03:03.72 --> 01:03:04.56
efficient.

635
01:03:04.56 --> 01:03:06.60
I'm not rushing, but I'm trying to be efficient.

636
01:03:06.60 --> 01:03:08.92
So I'm grab, I have like, you know,

637
01:03:08.92 --> 01:03:12.36
I get like maybe four dishes of sorts at a time.

638
01:03:12.36 --> 01:03:13.36
Yeah.

639
01:03:13.36 --> 01:03:17.64
And so, but I look at what I grabbed.

640
01:03:17.64 --> 01:03:20.40
And I get this feeling like shoot.

641
01:03:20.40 --> 01:03:21.24
Where do I go?

642
01:03:21.24 --> 01:03:22.24
Do I go here first?

643
01:03:22.24 --> 01:03:23.08
You know?

644
01:03:23.08 --> 01:03:26.68
And put away the pots first that I have in my hand?

645
01:03:26.68 --> 01:03:28.56
We're doing over here because if I go over here,

646
01:03:28.56 --> 01:03:30.08
I can do that kind of thing.

647
01:03:30.08 --> 01:03:31.72
And I'm at this little conundrum.

648
01:03:31.72 --> 01:03:33.12
But I'm like, you know what I should do?

649
01:03:33.12 --> 01:03:34.36
And this is all just going on in my head.

650
01:03:34.36 --> 01:03:35.92
It takes maybe like four, five seconds.

651
01:03:35.92 --> 01:03:37.32
But,

652
01:03:37.32 --> 01:03:39.68
I'm taking this seems kind of long.

653
01:03:39.68 --> 01:03:40.68
Yeah.

654
01:03:40.68 --> 01:03:42.72
But I don't want to make videos here.

655
01:03:42.72 --> 01:03:45.32
They're the bait yourself about pots and pans and glasses.

656
01:03:45.32 --> 01:03:46.92
Soy sauce dishes.

657
01:03:46.92 --> 01:03:47.92
Is that an actual thing?

658
01:03:47.92 --> 01:03:48.92
It's a little more on there.

659
01:03:48.92 --> 01:03:50.92
It's bad because this is lit.

660
01:03:50.92 --> 01:03:51.92
I'm not exaggerating.

661
01:03:51.92 --> 01:03:53.92
This literally goes in my head.

662
01:03:53.92 --> 01:03:55.92
And it's this micro little almost anxiety.

663
01:03:55.92 --> 01:03:56.92
It's not anxiety.

664
01:03:56.92 --> 01:03:58.92
But it's like, it's there.

665
01:03:58.92 --> 01:03:59.92
It's something.

666
01:03:59.92 --> 01:04:01.92
It's not like, you know, I'm not just like,

667
01:04:01.92 --> 01:04:02.92
Oh, just making taking action.

668
01:04:02.92 --> 01:04:03.92
I'm not doing that.

669
01:04:03.92 --> 01:04:05.92
I'm like literally standing there.

670
01:04:05.92 --> 01:04:07.92
Not doing anything, thinking about this stuff.

671
01:04:07.92 --> 01:04:08.92
So I'm like, okay.

672
01:04:08.92 --> 01:04:10.92
Why have I done this situation?

673
01:04:10.92 --> 01:04:12.92
We have to make actual decisions.

674
01:04:12.92 --> 01:04:13.92
That's not the problem.

675
01:04:13.92 --> 01:04:15.92
If this is any indication,

676
01:04:15.92 --> 01:04:16.92
it will be a problem.

677
01:04:16.92 --> 01:04:18.92
So I'm looking and I'm like,

678
01:04:18.92 --> 01:04:19.92
Where should I go?

679
01:04:19.92 --> 01:04:20.92
Should I go?

680
01:04:20.92 --> 01:04:21.92
Should I go?

681
01:04:21.92 --> 01:04:22.92
They say, I said, no, you know what I'm going to do?

682
01:04:22.92 --> 01:04:25.92
I'm going to put this whole side of this.

683
01:04:25.92 --> 01:04:26.92
The dishes that go on this side.

684
01:04:26.92 --> 01:04:27.92
I'm going to put those back.

685
01:04:27.92 --> 01:04:29.92
I'm going to grab stuff that all go on that side.

686
01:04:29.92 --> 01:04:32.92
But wait, now I've got to take the time to put this back in search and grab.

687
01:04:32.92 --> 01:04:34.92
Other ones, I'm losing time.

688
01:04:34.92 --> 01:04:35.92
That's less efficient.

689
01:04:35.92 --> 01:04:37.92
Giving the point that I'm at right now.

690
01:04:37.92 --> 01:04:38.92
Something like, man.

691
01:04:38.92 --> 01:04:40.92
And then, you know, then, of course,

692
01:04:40.92 --> 01:04:41.92
I'll just be like, whatever.

693
01:04:41.92 --> 01:04:43.92
I'll just kind of let go.

694
01:04:43.92 --> 01:04:45.92
But the point is, probably that happens.

695
01:04:45.92 --> 01:04:47.92
Literally happens.

696
01:04:47.92 --> 01:04:48.92
If it happened,

697
01:04:48.92 --> 01:04:51.92
happening to you, echoed Charles with the dishes.

698
01:04:51.92 --> 01:04:55.92
Yeah, I can imagine that other people feel it.

699
01:04:55.92 --> 01:04:56.92
When there's actual decisions to be made.

700
01:04:56.92 --> 01:04:58.92
Yeah, it'll just to wrap this whole thing up.

701
01:04:58.92 --> 01:05:00.92
But I don't want to talk about that anymore.

702
01:05:00.92 --> 01:05:01.92
Ever.

703
01:05:01.92 --> 01:05:03.92
But if you were smart,

704
01:05:03.92 --> 01:05:06.92
you would just organize your kitchen so that everything is located.

705
01:05:06.92 --> 01:05:10.92
Colocated, all things that go from dishwasher going to this small area.

706
01:05:10.92 --> 01:05:11.92
So think about that one.

707
01:05:11.92 --> 01:05:14.92
Whoa, don't think about it for too long.

708
01:05:14.92 --> 01:05:16.92
I don't want you to freak and stress out.

709
01:05:16.92 --> 01:05:17.92
Get anxiety.

710
01:05:17.92 --> 01:05:20.92
But that a lot of those, like, he puts it in terms of, like,

711
01:05:20.92 --> 01:05:23.92
in two times of instincts, right?

712
01:05:23.92 --> 01:05:24.92
Yeah.

713
01:05:24.92 --> 01:05:27.92
Social and social and human survival.

714
01:05:27.92 --> 01:05:28.92
Yeah.

715
01:05:28.92 --> 01:05:31.92
It's like, a big one, or a way to see it is, like,

716
01:05:31.92 --> 01:05:34.92
how you point it out to me, like, the long game.

717
01:05:34.92 --> 01:05:36.92
You know, it's like, either you're playing this or game in the long game.

718
01:05:36.92 --> 01:05:37.92
So it's kind of like that.

719
01:05:37.92 --> 01:05:40.92
Like, there's, like, you, you had the example of the buying the car thing.

720
01:05:40.92 --> 01:05:42.92
That's the short term versus long term payoff situation.

721
01:05:42.92 --> 01:05:45.92
Most things are when you have that little conundrum.

722
01:05:45.92 --> 01:05:46.92
You know, like, you know, you know, you, you know,

723
01:05:46.92 --> 01:05:50.92
you, you have to eat this pot of brown or these pant of brownies,

724
01:05:50.92 --> 01:05:52.92
but I want to eat those brownies because they're delicious,

725
01:05:52.92 --> 01:05:55.92
but I don't want to get, you know, you know, put on weight or whatever.

726
01:05:55.92 --> 01:05:56.92
You know, it's kind of the same thing.

727
01:05:56.92 --> 01:05:58.92
I want both kind of thing, but then they,

728
01:05:58.92 --> 01:06:00.92
almost the time I think, anyway,

729
01:06:00.92 --> 01:06:03.92
it sorts itself out to be a short term versus long term struggle.

730
01:06:03.92 --> 01:06:06.92
And I think the important thing here is that you can actually take this concept

731
01:06:06.92 --> 01:06:09.92
and apply it to meaningful decisions that he really is after make.

732
01:06:09.92 --> 01:06:13.92
Yeah, not just soy sauce bowls and brownies.

733
01:06:13.92 --> 01:06:16.92
No diet is a big one.

734
01:06:16.92 --> 01:06:17.92
That is a big one.

735
01:06:17.92 --> 01:06:20.92
It's not a big one when you compare it to storming the beaches of Yuo Jima.

736
01:06:20.92 --> 01:06:22.92
Just saying, I agree with that.

737
01:06:22.92 --> 01:06:23.92
Yes, sir.

738
01:06:23.92 --> 01:06:28.92
And speaking of which, and this is where this is obviously this part here is probably written

739
01:06:28.92 --> 01:06:31.92
more directed at you back to the book.

740
01:06:31.92 --> 01:06:32.92
Men differently,

741
01:06:32.92 --> 01:06:36.92
care abilities to stand up under this internal personal conflict.

742
01:06:36.92 --> 01:06:43.92
Most men can come successfully through terrorizing experiences,

743
01:06:43.92 --> 01:06:46.92
revolting scenes and exposure to death.

744
01:06:46.92 --> 01:06:50.92
War is older than history and all nations and tribes have resorted to it.

745
01:06:50.92 --> 01:06:56.92
So even the terrorizing experience that you have with the soy sauce bowls.

746
01:06:56.92 --> 01:06:59.92
That one's got it.

747
01:06:59.92 --> 01:07:02.92
That's rough.

748
01:07:02.92 --> 01:07:04.92
Continuing.

749
01:07:04.92 --> 01:07:10.92
The average soldier has conflicts, but settles them himself with no one else, the wiser.

750
01:07:10.92 --> 01:07:14.92
So he finds himself free to fight with his whole strength on him.

751
01:07:14.92 --> 01:07:17.92
The average free soldier victory depends.

752
01:07:17.92 --> 01:07:21.92
Fortunately, the first contact with the enemy is the hardest.

753
01:07:21.92 --> 01:07:24.92
In seasons, troops internal conflict diminishes.

754
01:07:24.92 --> 01:07:28.92
They have faced the worse and know it is not intolerable.

755
01:07:28.92 --> 01:07:33.92
Even soldiers who have to retreat are not defeated if they have learned to conquer their own.

756
01:07:33.92 --> 01:07:35.92
They will advance to another time.

757
01:07:35.92 --> 01:07:42.92
Having once won the fight with the inner man and having faced the reality of battle, finding it.

758
01:07:42.92 --> 01:07:50.92
Finding in it less terror and more opportunity for success than the green recoup could ever have believed possible.

759
01:07:50.92 --> 01:07:54.92
But the enemy has to be the best enemy to fight with the enemy.

760
01:07:54.92 --> 01:07:56.92
And the enemy has to be the best enemy to fight with the enemy.

761
01:07:56.92 --> 01:07:59.92
And the enemy has to be the best enemy to fight with the enemy.

762
01:07:59.92 --> 01:08:04.92
And the enemy has to be the best enemy to fight with the enemy to fight with the enemy.

763
01:08:04.92 --> 01:08:10.92
So now we get to this section in the book.

764
01:08:10.92 --> 01:08:17.92
And like I said, this section that I actually wanted to cover, but we ended up covering this whole book over the course of three podcasts.

765
01:08:17.92 --> 01:08:23.92
And this section is called Leadership.

766
01:08:23.92 --> 01:08:26.92
You can't boss a brick.

767
01:08:26.92 --> 01:08:32.92
You can't even boss a dog unless the dog has been trained to obey and has formed habits of responding to commands.

768
01:08:32.92 --> 01:08:36.92
And before you can boss him, you must know what commands he will respond to.

769
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:44.92
The famous seeing eye docks can do wonderful things to aid the blind, but both dog and master must first go through a period of training.

770
01:08:44.92 --> 01:08:47.92
So there you go.

771
01:08:47.92 --> 01:08:48.92
And now we get this.

772
01:08:48.92 --> 01:08:52.92
Affordy is not power.

773
01:08:52.92 --> 01:08:55.92
That's an epic statement.

774
01:08:55.92 --> 01:08:57.92
Listen to this.

775
01:08:57.92 --> 01:09:07.92
No amount of legal authority over the grizzly bears of British Columbia would enable you to get yourself obeyed by them out in the woods.

776
01:09:07.92 --> 01:09:12.92
Men can be commanded only after they have acquired habits of obeying.

777
01:09:12.92 --> 01:09:16.92
After and after their leader has learned to give them commands that make these habits work.

778
01:09:16.92 --> 01:09:21.92
All successful leadership thus depends on the habits of those who are to be led.

779
01:09:21.92 --> 01:09:30.92
The officer standing before his men is limited in the direct exercise of his authority by what the troops are able to get through their eyes and ears.

780
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:31.92
So this is this interesting.

781
01:09:31.92 --> 01:09:33.92
You're going to see in this opening section here.

782
01:09:33.92 --> 01:09:37.92
It's really leaning towards that traditional military idea of leadership.

783
01:09:37.92 --> 01:09:41.92
It's like, look, if you're trained correctly and I give you an order, you're going to listen.

784
01:09:41.92 --> 01:09:45.92
And so that's where this thing kind of starts off with.

785
01:09:45.92 --> 01:09:52.92
And as you probably can figure out that's contrary to what I believe effective leadership to consist of.

786
01:09:52.92 --> 01:09:54.92
But it's talking about it.

787
01:09:54.92 --> 01:10:02.92
And even though I don't believe that's the most effective form of leadership and a matter of fact, I know it's not the most effective form of leadership.

788
01:10:02.92 --> 01:10:06.92
That being said, it is a form of leadership.

789
01:10:06.92 --> 01:10:09.92
And it is, it can be effective.

790
01:10:09.92 --> 01:10:13.92
It does work in many situations where it's like, look, I'm the boss.

791
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:16.92
I'm the one that's right in the paychecks. I'm the one that's got the rank.

792
01:10:16.92 --> 01:10:19.92
And when I tell you to do something, you're going to get it done.

793
01:10:19.92 --> 01:10:27.92
And that is a normal sort of baseline rudimentary form of leadership.

794
01:10:27.92 --> 01:10:29.92
So it does exist.

795
01:10:29.92 --> 01:10:39.92
Back to the book, when a 40 is not obeyed, the fault may lie in the manner of speech of the leader or else it may be that the men are in need of basic training.

796
01:10:39.92 --> 01:10:44.92
But if you look, say, look, if people aren't listening to you, it could be the way that you're talking to them.

797
01:10:44.92 --> 01:10:53.92
And now it starts to, but the reason I said this is starting off talking about type of leadership that I don't really find to be optimum at all.

798
01:10:53.92 --> 01:10:59.92
But you're going to see that it start to lead towards the type of leadership that I do believe to be effective.

799
01:10:59.92 --> 01:11:02.92
And they actually believe it to be the most effective too. So continue on.

800
01:11:02.92 --> 01:11:07.92
It is often said that a good leader knows how to handle his men.

801
01:11:07.92 --> 01:11:12.92
Actually, however, it is not possible for any leader to handle his men.

802
01:11:12.92 --> 01:11:16.92
It is himself that he handles.

803
01:11:16.92 --> 01:11:19.92
Then the men react to his department.

804
01:11:19.92 --> 01:11:26.92
And the way in which they react depends in turn on their habits of thought and action.

805
01:11:26.92 --> 01:11:28.92
So that's a great statement.

806
01:11:28.92 --> 01:11:33.92
Being a leader, it's, you don't handle your men. You handle yourself.

807
01:11:33.92 --> 01:11:42.92
You're the one that you need to handle. And then if you handle yourself correctly, the team will then react to the way that you handle yourself.

808
01:11:42.92 --> 01:11:46.92
So that now we're starting to lean towards what I believe to be good leadership.

809
01:11:46.92 --> 01:11:49.92
That's leading by example.

810
01:11:49.92 --> 01:11:52.92
Next section, discipline.

811
01:11:52.92 --> 01:11:58.92
In an army, much of this training on which leadership depends is established by discipline.

812
01:11:58.92 --> 01:12:02.92
Discipline is training in the habits of attention and obedience.

813
01:12:02.92 --> 01:12:06.92
Without such habits, we might have a crowd or a mob, but not an army.

814
01:12:06.92 --> 01:12:09.92
It is quite possible to lead a mob.

815
01:12:09.92 --> 01:12:16.92
Yet such leadership is uncertain, depending largely on the accidents of personal appearance and unfortunate timing.

816
01:12:16.92 --> 01:12:22.92
In an army, however, there have been many leaders of many ranks and they have been interchangeable.

817
01:12:22.92 --> 01:12:27.92
If a leader is killed, another must be ready to take his place and lead men.

818
01:12:27.92 --> 01:12:35.92
So it's talking about discipline and this is talking about the traditional form of military discipline.

819
01:12:35.92 --> 01:12:39.92
Hey, there's a rank structure. You must be obedient.

820
01:12:39.92 --> 01:12:47.92
And that is not the optimal type of discipline that I believe in, which is, hey, we are a discipline team.

821
01:12:47.92 --> 01:12:51.92
We have discipline standard operating procedures. We understand what the mission is.

822
01:12:51.92 --> 01:12:52.92
We understand what the goals are.

823
01:12:52.92 --> 01:12:56.92
We are going to move in that direction with discipline.

824
01:12:56.92 --> 01:13:01.92
And the discipline is not imposed discipline that I impose on my team.

825
01:13:01.92 --> 01:13:09.92
It's discipline that they impose on themselves because they realize that it makes them more effective and more efficient and more likely to be able to accomplish the mission.

826
01:13:09.92 --> 01:13:11.92
Which they believe it?

827
01:13:13.92 --> 01:13:17.92
Now it talks a little bit about learning obedience.

828
01:13:17.92 --> 01:13:22.92
And again, obedience to me is not something that I'm looking for from my team.

829
01:13:22.92 --> 01:13:25.92
It's not what I'm looking for. I'm not looking for obedience.

830
01:13:25.92 --> 01:13:31.92
I'm looking for people that know how to understand what the goal is and that are going to move towards the goal.

831
01:13:31.92 --> 01:13:36.92
The first requisite of command is attention.

832
01:13:36.92 --> 01:13:38.92
So you got to get people to pay attention to.

833
01:13:38.92 --> 01:13:39.92
That makes sense.

834
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:45.92
What men do invariably and repeatedly is finally drilled into them.

835
01:13:45.92 --> 01:13:47.92
Becomes for them second nature.

836
01:13:47.92 --> 01:13:56.92
They learn to perform axiomonyneures in response to commands or orders because the command or order has always been accompanied by the act and the act by the command.

837
01:13:56.92 --> 01:13:59.92
Meer lecturing never trains men in action.

838
01:13:59.92 --> 01:14:02.92
At best it makes them learn mere words sequences.

839
01:14:02.92 --> 01:14:09.92
Except when the listeners already know enough about the required action to perform it in imagination.

840
01:14:09.92 --> 01:14:12.92
Learning something new in other words requires participation.

841
01:14:12.92 --> 01:14:16.92
You don't learn to swim by taking a course behind its course.

842
01:14:16.92 --> 01:14:20.92
So yes, you have to drill people. You have to get to make it second nature.

843
01:14:20.92 --> 01:14:21.92
That is true.

844
01:14:21.92 --> 01:14:23.92
We did that in the sales teams.

845
01:14:23.92 --> 01:14:25.92
They do that in the military. People know what they're going to do.

846
01:14:25.92 --> 01:14:28.92
When they get shot at, they know what from a certain direction.

847
01:14:28.92 --> 01:14:29.92
Everyone knows what they're going to do.

848
01:14:29.92 --> 01:14:34.92
And we drill it over and over and over again until you don't have to think about it second nature.

849
01:14:34.92 --> 01:14:38.92
Unfortunately bad habits as well as good can be learned.

850
01:14:38.92 --> 01:14:42.92
If on spoken command men do not respond, then they are learning not to respond.

851
01:14:42.92 --> 01:14:47.92
Whenever they are ordered to do something they cannot do, they are learning to disobey.

852
01:14:47.92 --> 01:14:55.92
Military manuals embody this fact in a rule never give a command that you do not expect to be obeyed.

853
01:14:55.92 --> 01:14:57.92
Now that's a brilliant statement.

854
01:14:57.92 --> 01:15:01.92
And I don't necessarily think it's a brilliant statement for the same reasons.

855
01:15:01.92 --> 01:15:04.92
But actually pretty close.

856
01:15:04.92 --> 01:15:09.92
If you wait, if I'm looking at you and you're working for me.

857
01:15:09.92 --> 01:15:13.92
And I say, yeah, you need to get all the stuff moved by, by noon today.

858
01:15:13.92 --> 01:15:15.92
And I know there's no physical way for you to do it.

859
01:15:15.92 --> 01:15:17.92
I'm wasting it.

860
01:15:17.92 --> 01:15:24.92
And I'm diminishing my authority over you because you're thinking, no, it's no way I can do that.

861
01:15:24.92 --> 01:15:26.92
So now you're definitely not going to do it.

862
01:15:26.92 --> 01:15:33.92
And the next time I say to get something done, you've got to already a preconceived notion that you don't really have to do it.

863
01:15:33.92 --> 01:15:34.92
Yeah.

864
01:15:34.92 --> 01:15:36.92
So that's a great statement.

865
01:15:36.92 --> 01:15:41.92
If you're in charge, never give a command that you don't expect to be obeyed.

866
01:15:41.92 --> 01:15:42.92
Don't do it.

867
01:15:42.92 --> 01:15:44.92
Keep your mouth shut.

868
01:15:44.92 --> 01:15:46.92
Figure out something that can be done.

869
01:15:46.92 --> 01:15:54.92
Thus a young leader when he finds himself so situated that his command might be disregarded must refrain from giving it.

870
01:15:54.92 --> 01:16:02.92
He must first try to change the situation, capture the attention, he must merely wait until he is reasonably certain that when he gives his order it will indeed be obeyed.

871
01:16:02.92 --> 01:16:07.92
So make sense.

872
01:16:07.92 --> 01:16:12.92
And now we get into the section called the leader.

873
01:16:12.92 --> 01:16:23.92
And this is now where we start to come towards the vision of leadership or the principles of leadership that I believe in.

874
01:16:23.92 --> 01:16:24.92
Back to the book.

875
01:16:24.92 --> 01:16:31.92
A good leader does not depend solely on the authority that discipline gives him as an officer or non-commission officer for

876
01:16:31.92 --> 01:16:36.92
good leadership goes far beyond discipline.

877
01:16:36.92 --> 01:16:50.92
A good experienced leader inspires respect, confidence and loyalty in his subordinates all of which enable him to get from his men performance far above what a new leader could command.

878
01:16:50.92 --> 01:16:51.92
So there you go.

879
01:16:51.92 --> 01:16:52.92
All this stuff that we just talked about.

880
01:16:52.92 --> 01:16:53.92
You got to train him.

881
01:16:53.92 --> 01:16:54.92
You got to have discipline.

882
01:16:54.92 --> 01:16:55.92
You got to make sure they're going to obey your orders.

883
01:16:55.92 --> 01:16:56.92
You got to teach him obedience.

884
01:16:56.92 --> 01:17:00.92
All that stuff is nothing compared to the power of

885
01:17:00.92 --> 01:17:03.92
respect of loyalty.

886
01:17:03.92 --> 01:17:05.92
Continue on.

887
01:17:05.92 --> 01:17:09.92
In this, the leader can rely on the generous cooperation of his men.

888
01:17:09.92 --> 01:17:14.92
For men have a natural longing to respect and have affection for their leaders.

889
01:17:14.92 --> 01:17:24.92
They want to be proud of their officers and non-commissioned officers just as they want to be proud of their unit and their branch of service.

890
01:17:24.92 --> 01:17:30.92
When the new army was first being formed, many of the officers had little experience and command.

891
01:17:30.92 --> 01:17:38.92
They had learned the words were capable of giving directions and instructions, but they had learned either the action or the manner that go with the command.

892
01:17:38.92 --> 01:17:44.92
A young officer would utter an order, but his manner would betray his lack of confidence.

893
01:17:44.92 --> 01:17:52.92
This uncertainty wasn't effective signal for not carrying the order out promptly and effectively as military orders must be carried out.

894
01:17:52.92 --> 01:18:00.92
All our lives, we have depended on the manner and behavior of others as well as on their speech to know what is in their minds.

895
01:18:00.92 --> 01:18:04.92
Army discipline cannot change human nature.

896
01:18:04.92 --> 01:18:15.92
What did Sarah Armstrong say that 70% of conveyed message in a conversation is from non-verbal cues?

897
01:18:15.92 --> 01:18:17.92
That's massive.

898
01:18:17.92 --> 01:18:22.92
I wonder if that includes like tone or not.

899
01:18:22.92 --> 01:18:23.92
I don't think it does.

900
01:18:23.92 --> 01:18:26.92
Technically it wouldn't, because that's a verbal cue.

901
01:18:26.92 --> 01:18:30.92
So we know that whatever the number is, it's a massive amount.

902
01:18:30.92 --> 01:18:39.92
It's a massive amount that is conveyed by what your posture is, what your delivery looks like, what your countenance reads, all those things.

903
01:18:39.92 --> 01:18:54.92
And then let's include tone in it, right? Which the tone should be in there somewhere. If you're giving orders and you look like you don't know what you're doing and you're sound like you don't know you're doing and you're using a tone that sounds like you don't know what you're doing.

904
01:18:54.92 --> 01:19:00.92
You're not going to get a lot of people jumping in there to execute what you're telling them to do.

905
01:19:00.92 --> 01:19:12.92
But that is not because when you think about it, I mean even saying that you start to think about what, all the little things, all of them that you're doing while you're saying something or trying to say something.

906
01:19:12.92 --> 01:19:19.92
Like even blinking, even if you blinked one time versus ten times, just blinking that teeny teeny tiny thing.

907
01:19:19.92 --> 01:19:20.92
Yeah.

908
01:19:20.92 --> 01:19:23.92
When you say, you know like, Brad, it's like you're saying something completely different.

909
01:19:23.92 --> 01:19:28.92
Even if, even though like when I'm talking to people, I will not blink.

910
01:19:28.92 --> 01:19:34.92
I noticed that very early on in our relationship that you don't really blink when you're talking about.

911
01:19:34.92 --> 01:19:43.92
I will look at, and the weird thing is, is I'm not consciously doing that kind of thing, but I do know that it's happening.

912
01:19:43.92 --> 01:19:48.92
Yeah. And when I, when I first started making videos, I noticed it a lot.

913
01:19:48.92 --> 01:19:53.92
So, you know, because I noticed like villains and characters, certain types, quote unquote types of characters.

914
01:19:53.92 --> 01:20:00.92
So, when a villain, when an actor is playing a villain and he's saying something that's evil or whatever.

915
01:20:00.92 --> 01:20:03.92
And he's blinking, Brad, I don't buy it at all.

916
01:20:03.92 --> 01:20:05.92
And to the fact you kind of can't really buy it.

917
01:20:05.92 --> 01:20:12.92
But if they're saying something, if it's important in whatever way and they're not blinking, it's almost like, man, that alone sells it so much.

918
01:20:12.92 --> 01:20:14.92
Just that alone, of course, this other stuff.

919
01:20:14.92 --> 01:20:19.92
But like, yeah, what blinking, even like wrinkling your forehead kind of thing, like all these little things,

920
01:20:19.92 --> 01:20:23.92
so it goes so deep that, you know, you can take two people.

921
01:20:23.92 --> 01:20:25.92
One guy does hand motions all the time.

922
01:20:25.92 --> 01:20:27.92
You know, he just he moves his hands a lot when he talks.

923
01:20:27.92 --> 01:20:32.92
And the other guy does the exact opposite. He moves his hands so little that it's noticeable.

924
01:20:32.92 --> 01:20:35.92
It's not that, oh, he lacks verbal communication.

925
01:20:35.92 --> 01:20:41.92
It's his inner, it's that his inaction is his verbal communication.

926
01:20:41.92 --> 01:20:46.92
So, he's saying so it's not like he has less verbal communication than the guy who uses his hands.

927
01:20:46.92 --> 01:20:50.92
He has just as much. He's just saying something completely different because he's still,

928
01:20:50.92 --> 01:20:54.92
seem saying so it's like just all these non-verbal things. That's a deepic statement.

929
01:20:54.92 --> 01:21:00.92
Yeah, and this is where self-awareness, this is where role playing and most important.

930
01:21:00.92 --> 01:21:08.92
Good, because look, you're not going to, you're not going to become an Academy award-winning actor.

931
01:21:08.92 --> 01:21:12.92
So what you actually need to do is believe in what you're saying.

932
01:21:12.92 --> 01:21:14.92
Yeah, that's what you need to do.

933
01:21:14.92 --> 01:21:17.92
Yeah, don't believe in what you're saying. Your troops are looking at you.

934
01:21:17.92 --> 01:21:21.92
Yeah, okay. He doesn't even believe this. Why am I going to go charge this machine gun nest?

935
01:21:21.92 --> 01:21:25.92
Well, this guy doesn't even believe it. He should be charged in this machine gun nest.

936
01:21:25.92 --> 01:21:28.92
And yet, if you truly believe that this is what you go down,

937
01:21:28.92 --> 01:21:33.92
you people will see that you believe it and they're going to follow.

938
01:21:33.92 --> 01:21:36.92
Yeah, so I feel about this. This might be slightly separate.

939
01:21:36.92 --> 01:21:41.92
Okay, so you know, people, people don't give you the advice like you want to, you want to act confident.

940
01:21:41.92 --> 01:21:45.92
You want to be confident when you do this stuff, even if you're not confident or whatever.

941
01:21:45.92 --> 01:21:50.92
Okay. So it's kind of like people can smell when you're not confident and you're acting confident.

942
01:21:50.92 --> 01:21:54.92
Same way they can smell it when you're trying to act casual or act real act.

943
01:21:54.92 --> 01:21:57.92
But hi, I can see, you know, everyone can see that.

944
01:21:57.92 --> 01:22:02.92
But if you do it enough, doesn't it start don't you get kind of good at it?

945
01:22:02.92 --> 01:22:05.92
Well, that's the advice that I give people.

946
01:22:05.92 --> 01:22:11.92
Isn't go be confident when you talk to people? What I say is when you talk to people,

947
01:22:11.92 --> 01:22:14.92
make sure you know what you're talking about.

948
01:22:14.92 --> 01:22:19.92
Yeah, because if you know what you're talking about, you will come across as confident.

949
01:22:19.92 --> 01:22:23.92
Why will you come across as confident? Because you are confident.

950
01:22:23.92 --> 01:22:29.92
Now, sure, there's some people that have some natural ability to act confident, even when they're not.

951
01:22:29.92 --> 01:22:34.92
Yes, and there's also some people that can be very convincing and telling people to do something that they don't actually believe it.

952
01:22:34.92 --> 01:22:36.92
That's very rare. It's very rare.

953
01:22:36.92 --> 01:22:40.92
And even I feel like those people, and obviously I don't know because I don't know all the people,

954
01:22:40.92 --> 01:22:43.92
but it seems like those of you who they're just used to doing it.

955
01:22:43.92 --> 01:22:46.92
They're used to telling tall tales with complete confidence.

956
01:22:46.92 --> 01:22:54.92
Yeah, but you can see how people if they repeatedly talk about the same thing, certainly they get better at it.

957
01:22:54.92 --> 01:22:59.92
And can they take that too far where they're just turning into a robot that's up there reciting something that they've heard

958
01:22:59.92 --> 01:23:01.92
and people go, oh, this kind of just got this memorized.

959
01:23:01.92 --> 01:23:10.92
Because that's jacked up too, right? Like, if you just go, oh, this guy's just memorized this thing and he's not really into it.

960
01:23:10.92 --> 01:23:12.92
Right? That's not a good sign either.

961
01:23:12.92 --> 01:23:14.92
Yeah, people can see through that.

962
01:23:14.92 --> 01:23:20.92
Yeah, if it's like, yeah, man, you've manufactured enthusiasm or something like that.

963
01:23:20.92 --> 01:23:24.92
Yeah, if they can smell it for sure, but because some people like they'll memorize it,

964
01:23:24.92 --> 01:23:27.92
let's say if it's a speedy, obviously depends on the context totally.

965
01:23:27.92 --> 01:23:33.92
But if it's a speech or a lecture or a presentation that somebody's giving that they always give.

966
01:23:33.92 --> 01:23:42.92
And when they talk about this XYZ exciting part or important part, they've done it literally 10,000 times.

967
01:23:42.92 --> 01:23:45.92
So they're not going to convey natural excitement.

968
01:23:45.92 --> 01:23:48.92
They have to sort of manufacture it for the crowd kind of thing.

969
01:23:48.92 --> 01:23:54.92
And yeah, if that manufactured excitement comes off as manufactured to the crowd,

970
01:23:54.92 --> 01:24:03.92
that'll jam you. Yeah, and I think that's why you have to be talking about something that you know about is part one.

971
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:07.92
And part two, you have to be talking about something that you care about.

972
01:24:07.92 --> 01:24:14.92
Yeah, if you don't care about, you don't want to hear me stand up and talk about something, you know,

973
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:24.92
some whatever, you don't want to hear me talk about candle making, right? Because I don't care about candle making.

974
01:24:24.92 --> 01:24:27.92
In fact, it don't really like candles.

975
01:24:27.92 --> 01:24:32.92
I'm just being honest here. I respect your people.

976
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:39.92
I don't like candles. Why would you have candles? It's 2019. You have a light, right?

977
01:24:39.92 --> 01:24:44.92
Well, there's many different reasons for candles, but yeah, my mood lighting, you know, centered.

978
01:24:44.92 --> 01:24:47.92
My point is, I don't like candles. You don't want to hear me talk about candles.

979
01:24:47.92 --> 01:24:50.92
You don't want to hear me talk about the construction of candles because I don't care about it.

980
01:24:50.92 --> 01:24:55.92
And I'm not going to give a very passionate talk about candles.

981
01:24:55.92 --> 01:25:08.92
Even if I study this subject matter, if you hear me talking about leadership, you can't harness the enthusiasm that I have for talking about leadership.

982
01:25:08.92 --> 01:25:14.92
You can't, you can't hold it back. It's coming out. Unbridled. It's unbridled. It's coming out because I really care about this.

983
01:25:14.92 --> 01:25:18.92
You know, when I'm talking to a bunch of people that are leaders, I want them to win.

984
01:25:18.92 --> 01:25:24.92
I want them to learn. I want them to absorb what I'm saying because I know it can be helpful to them because I've seen it be helpful to thousands of people.

985
01:25:24.92 --> 01:25:26.92
So I want them to get the message.

986
01:25:26.92 --> 01:25:30.92
And so it's going to come out that way. So I know what I'm talking about.

987
01:25:30.92 --> 01:25:34.92
I believe what I'm talking about, what I am talking about.

988
01:25:34.92 --> 01:25:44.92
And if you're talking to people, try and talk about things that you know about. That you care about and that you believe in.

989
01:25:44.92 --> 01:25:54.92
And if you do that as a leader when you're giving direction and it's direction that you believe in, it's direction that you care about the outcome and it's direction that you know and understand.

990
01:25:54.92 --> 01:25:59.92
You are going to come across like a confident leader and people are going to listen to you.

991
01:25:59.92 --> 01:26:03.92
If you're failing in those categories, it's going to be harder for you.

992
01:26:03.92 --> 01:26:05.92
I understand.

993
01:26:09.92 --> 01:26:11.92
This is interesting.

994
01:26:11.92 --> 01:26:23.92
Continuing on, we just want a little riff right there, but a leader is actually giving conflicting orders if his uncertain manner, hence that he does not expect obedience or that he thinks he may not be obeyed.

995
01:26:23.92 --> 01:26:30.92
So even if you stand up and you say it, you can be give conflicting orders if you just don't, if you just look like you're unsure of what you're doing.

996
01:26:30.92 --> 01:26:43.92
Right. Although it is possible for the new leader who has lacked experience to imitate the manner and tone of why is it leaders around him only practice and command develops the appropriate manner and tone.

997
01:26:43.92 --> 01:26:53.92
And I would go further to say, it's not just about practice, you don't have to become a good actor, what you want to do is you want to believe in what you say, you want to care about what you say, you don't know about what you say.

998
01:26:53.92 --> 01:26:59.92
Next, lack of a confident manner inevitably interferes with command.

999
01:26:59.92 --> 01:27:16.92
So also, may a manner that betrays indecision for men respond to the signs of indecision by withholding or delaying action. The rule is that a leader should make up his mind and arrive at that decision before he gives orders.

1000
01:27:16.92 --> 01:27:21.92
Very obvious, but not so obvious because people screw it up.

1001
01:27:21.92 --> 01:27:35.92
When he confronts his men, he must be ready to commit himself to this course or that men will accept assurance for competence and they do not want competence and they do want competence and leader. Now this is it again, this is a situation where I

1002
01:27:35.92 --> 01:27:47.92
Men will accept assurance for competence. That's not readily true because just because you're, if you're sure yourself the only way you're going to be sure yourself is if you are competent

1003
01:27:47.92 --> 01:27:53.92
unless you're one of these small fractions of people that are a con man, right? A con man that can be the, this will, what can you do everyone?

1004
01:27:53.92 --> 01:28:00.92
Like that's your con man, if you're really good at that, it can be aligned to people and tell them something that you don't believe in.

1005
01:28:00.92 --> 01:28:05.92
Fine, it'll work sometimes. If you're great at it might work more often than that.

1006
01:28:05.92 --> 01:28:14.92
If you're a normal person and you want to be a really good leader, you shouldn't be just using your confidence to overcome the fact that you don't believe in what you're doing.

1007
01:28:14.92 --> 01:28:19.92
And it's going to be really hard to do that. It is really hard to do that. People have really good

1008
01:28:19.92 --> 01:28:22.92
Lied detectors in their minds.

1009
01:28:25.92 --> 01:28:30.92
This is a great section. What soldiers think of leaders?

1010
01:28:30.92 --> 01:28:38.92
For the first time in the history of armies, the army of the United States has undertaken to find out what it's enlisted person now think about a large number of things important to the army.

1011
01:28:38.92 --> 01:28:45.92
Some thousands of soldiers have been interviewed at length and one of the subjects about which they were questioned is army leadership.

1012
01:28:45.92 --> 01:28:55.92
What the soldiers said makes it very clear that the quality of leadership in an army is the most important single-determiner of morale and performance.

1013
01:28:55.92 --> 01:29:07.92
Did everyone just hear that? What soldiers said makes it very clear that the quality of leadership in an army is the most important single-determiner.

1014
01:29:07.92 --> 01:29:12.92
The important single-determiner of morale and performance.

1015
01:29:12.92 --> 01:29:17.92
What do we say now? At Ashland Front, we say leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

1016
01:29:17.92 --> 01:29:24.92
I luckily don't have to pay the writer of this book to say that because that's the same thing.

1017
01:29:24.92 --> 01:29:33.92
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. Is the single most important determiner of morale and performance.

1018
01:29:33.92 --> 01:29:45.92
Continuing on, the relationship between men and officers commissioned and non-commissioned determines the fighting spirit of an army quite as much as the ability of the soldiers to take training does.

1019
01:29:45.92 --> 01:29:59.92
In fact, it turns out that these human relations are much more important to morale than beef steak, warm socks, ball games and voodveal shows or what the men believe about the war.

1020
01:29:59.92 --> 01:30:10.92
What they think with the relationship that you have with your people is more important than all these other things.

1021
01:30:10.92 --> 01:30:14.92
It's more important than they're actual belief in what they're doing.

1022
01:30:14.92 --> 01:30:18.92
More important than they're belief in the war. Continue on.

1023
01:30:18.92 --> 01:30:27.92
Among the 150-so items covered in the interview, 77 proved to be definitely associated with morale and of the 20 most closely related to morale,

1024
01:30:27.92 --> 01:30:32.92
and the team have to do with man to officer relations.

1025
01:30:32.92 --> 01:30:41.92
What the men think of their leaders is then of utmost importance to the army and to the successful prosecution of the war.

1026
01:30:41.92 --> 01:30:50.92
Roughly, in order of their association with good leadership, in the minds of the enlisted men are the following points.

1027
01:30:50.92 --> 01:31:04.92
Here's what makes a good leader. One, ability. Competence comes first. The good officer must know his stuff for on this depends the confidence in his leadership.

1028
01:31:04.92 --> 01:31:07.92
Boom.

1029
01:31:07.92 --> 01:31:17.92
And interestingly, that is proof of what I just said that if you don't believe in what you're doing, you don't know what you're doing.

1030
01:31:17.92 --> 01:31:23.92
Everyone's going to sense it. So competence number one. Number two. Next to the ability.

1031
01:31:23.92 --> 01:31:28.92
Next to ability is interest in the welfare of the soldier.

1032
01:31:28.92 --> 01:31:36.92
The officer who can be trusted to help the soldier in time of need or who would be accessible for personal advice is a good officer.

1033
01:31:36.92 --> 01:31:44.92
So you've got to be caring about your men. Number three, promptness in making decisions is next.

1034
01:31:44.92 --> 01:31:57.92
Number four, good teacher or instructor follows the leader who has the patience and the ability to make things clear to get men under him to get to make things clear to the men under him is valued for that reason.

1035
01:31:57.92 --> 01:31:59.92
So you've got to be a good teacher.

1036
01:31:59.92 --> 01:32:07.92
Number five, judgment, common sense and the ability to get things done follow in next.

1037
01:32:07.92 --> 01:32:16.92
Judgment and common sense is an interesting common sense. So what you know what we want you heard you have some common sense.

1038
01:32:16.92 --> 01:32:22.92
And that horribly cliched saying of common sense sometimes isn't very common.

1039
01:32:22.92 --> 01:32:23.92
Yeah.

1040
01:32:23.92 --> 01:32:25.92
And it's a cliche because it's true.

1041
01:32:25.92 --> 01:32:27.92
Yes.

1042
01:32:27.92 --> 01:32:38.92
And many times I've been sitting in a big meeting.

1043
01:32:38.92 --> 01:32:40.92
You know what I mean?

1044
01:32:40.92 --> 01:32:43.92
And said something that was so obvious.

1045
01:32:43.92 --> 01:32:48.92
Something to such common sense and had people kind of jaw dropped at this amazing statement which was completely obvious.

1046
01:32:48.92 --> 01:32:51.92
Sometimes common sense isn't too common.

1047
01:32:51.92 --> 01:32:52.92
Yeah.

1048
01:32:52.92 --> 01:33:02.92
I should say never, but it's not that good of an idea generally seem to be like, it's common to envy like mad at someone for not knowing quote, I'm not coming.

1049
01:33:02.92 --> 01:33:03.92
Yes.

1050
01:33:03.92 --> 01:33:04.92
No, it's not good.

1051
01:33:04.92 --> 01:33:09.92
And it's not good when you make a statement that is common sense to say it condescendingly.

1052
01:33:09.92 --> 01:33:11.92
Like this is just common sense.

1053
01:33:11.92 --> 01:33:13.92
Oh, and when you need to do this.

1054
01:33:13.92 --> 01:33:14.92
Yeah.

1055
01:33:14.92 --> 01:33:15.92
And then everyone already is mad at you.

1056
01:33:15.92 --> 01:33:16.92
Yeah.

1057
01:33:16.92 --> 01:33:17.92
They're resentful of you.

1058
01:33:17.92 --> 01:33:18.92
Yeah.

1059
01:33:18.92 --> 01:33:19.92
Just from the tone of the tone.

1060
01:33:19.92 --> 01:33:23.96
And then on top of that, you get your arms crossed and your shaking your head.

1061
01:33:23.96 --> 01:33:26.92
Give her a little serenity on verbal cue.

1062
01:33:26.92 --> 01:33:33.92
Yeah, yeah, because common sense in California is different than common sense in Texas.

1063
01:33:33.92 --> 01:33:34.92
Some of it.

1064
01:33:34.92 --> 01:33:35.92
Possibly.

1065
01:33:35.92 --> 01:33:36.92
Oh yeah.

1066
01:33:36.92 --> 01:33:37.92
Yeah.

1067
01:33:37.92 --> 01:33:39.92
Common sense in Texas is different than California.

1068
01:33:39.92 --> 01:33:40.92
That's true.

1069
01:33:40.92 --> 01:33:41.92
That's a good point.

1070
01:33:41.92 --> 01:33:42.92
You see, you are correct.

1071
01:33:42.92 --> 01:33:46.92
So you can, yeah, the number is going to be on you when you start doing that stuff.

1072
01:33:46.92 --> 01:33:50.92
What is happening?

1073
01:33:50.92 --> 01:33:51.92
Deal.

1074
01:33:51.92 --> 01:33:52.92
Here we go.

1075
01:33:52.92 --> 01:33:53.92
Number six.

1076
01:33:53.92 --> 01:33:56.92
The good leader does not boss you around when there is no good reason for it.

1077
01:33:56.92 --> 01:34:02.92
Soldiers dislike an officer who throws his rank around who tests his own authority continually.

1078
01:34:02.92 --> 01:34:07.92
They sense that he is not sure of himself.

1079
01:34:07.92 --> 01:34:09.92
Let that one sink in.

1080
01:34:09.92 --> 01:34:12.92
If you're bossing people around.

1081
01:34:12.92 --> 01:34:19.92
Using your rank to make things happen, your people don't like you.

1082
01:34:19.92 --> 01:34:22.92
And there's someone that says, I'm not here for my people like me.

1083
01:34:22.92 --> 01:34:23.92
You're wrong.

1084
01:34:23.92 --> 01:34:27.92
If people don't like you, they will not perform as well as people that do like you and your their leader.

1085
01:34:27.92 --> 01:34:32.92
Number seven, the man who tells you when you have done a good job rates well as a good leader.

1086
01:34:32.92 --> 01:34:37.92
Failure in combination is a common complaint among men in the ranks.

1087
01:34:37.92 --> 01:34:44.92
The best incentive to good work is the prospect that it will be noticed and remembered by the leader.

1088
01:34:44.92 --> 01:34:46.92
Solid.

1089
01:34:46.92 --> 01:34:48.92
Next.

1090
01:34:48.92 --> 01:34:51.92
And that's something I don't do a lot of.

1091
01:34:51.92 --> 01:34:53.92
I'm not like a gay good job buddy.

1092
01:34:53.92 --> 01:34:58.92
But I will say that when I do tell someone they did a good job, they know that I mean it.

1093
01:34:58.92 --> 01:35:00.92
You're usually pretty fired up that I said it to him.

1094
01:35:00.92 --> 01:35:03.92
Yeah, what a group that.

1095
01:35:03.92 --> 01:35:05.92
Number eight.

1096
01:35:05.92 --> 01:35:09.92
Physical strength and good build come next.

1097
01:35:09.92 --> 01:35:12.92
You're not in your head over there, I could trust.

1098
01:35:12.92 --> 01:35:14.92
Well, I agree.

1099
01:35:14.92 --> 01:35:15.92
Jack.

1100
01:35:15.92 --> 01:35:26.92
Because I mean, okay, so in at risk of sounding like maybe disparaging any one in particular or any type of person in particular.

1101
01:35:26.92 --> 01:35:28.92
But I'm just saying this is like factually.

1102
01:35:28.92 --> 01:35:31.92
So you ever watch it like a self-defense video?

1103
01:35:31.92 --> 01:35:32.92
Yes.

1104
01:35:32.92 --> 01:35:33.92
And no matter what.

1105
01:35:33.92 --> 01:35:34.92
Yes, because I'm.

1106
01:35:34.92 --> 01:35:36.92
I follow McDonald's your life.

1107
01:35:36.92 --> 01:35:37.92
Yeah.

1108
01:35:37.92 --> 01:35:38.92
So you're a little bit.

1109
01:35:38.92 --> 01:35:42.92
Mr. and Joe Rogan repost those McDonald's your life things.

1110
01:35:42.92 --> 01:35:42.92
Yeah.

1111
01:35:42.92 --> 01:35:42.92
Yeah.

1112
01:35:42.92 --> 01:35:44.92
So all kinds of weird self-defense things.

1113
01:35:44.92 --> 01:35:45.92
And I know we're going with this.

1114
01:35:45.92 --> 01:35:46.92
Yes.

1115
01:35:46.92 --> 01:35:47.92
So physical.

1116
01:35:47.92 --> 01:35:51.92
You know the self-defense guy who doesn't look like he could make it up a flight of stairs.

1117
01:35:51.92 --> 01:35:52.92
Yes.

1118
01:35:52.92 --> 01:35:55.92
And you're thinking, bro, I'm not going to listen to anything that you say.

1119
01:35:55.92 --> 01:35:55.92
Right.

1120
01:35:55.92 --> 01:35:59.92
Which, technically, his physique does not prove the effectiveness of his.

1121
01:35:59.92 --> 01:36:00.92
His tail is true.

1122
01:36:00.92 --> 01:36:01.92
It doesn't.

1123
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:03.92
But what about when he's got the sign hanging up in the back on the.

1124
01:36:03.92 --> 01:36:06.92
It says on or strengthen discipline.

1125
01:36:06.92 --> 01:36:14.92
And only discipline he has is putting away the quarter pounders with cheese daily.

1126
01:36:14.92 --> 01:36:16.92
And that's that's the point.

1127
01:36:16.92 --> 01:36:18.92
You know, so it's like Brad is something.

1128
01:36:18.92 --> 01:36:21.92
And I again, I don't want to just be a genuine system or whatever.

1129
01:36:21.92 --> 01:36:26.92
But yeah, man, if I'm a soldier or a listener or a follower and I'm going to.

1130
01:36:26.92 --> 01:36:27.92
First impression, right?

1131
01:36:27.92 --> 01:36:30.92
I come up to you and you're going to teach me something and you're like,

1132
01:36:30.92 --> 01:36:33.92
It's a sloppy, you're sloppy person. I'll tell you that's at the very least.

1133
01:36:33.92 --> 01:36:34.92
That's a strike against.

1134
01:36:34.92 --> 01:36:35.92
Well, there's no doubt about it.

1135
01:36:35.92 --> 01:36:40.92
And they're just just even me and Ramadi and telling all my guys,

1136
01:36:40.92 --> 01:36:43.92
Hey, you will wear a square away uniform because first impressions mean something.

1137
01:36:43.92 --> 01:36:44.92
Yes.

1138
01:36:44.92 --> 01:36:48.92
And so if somebody shows up to be in charge of you and they can't take charge of their own health,

1139
01:36:48.92 --> 01:36:51.92
it's an indicator that maybe they got some other issues,

1140
01:36:51.92 --> 01:36:55.92
especially, I mean, then this is clearly directed at.

1141
01:36:55.92 --> 01:36:59.92
People that are in the military because military is a physical job.

1142
01:36:59.92 --> 01:37:02.92
Pretty much regardless of what you're doing in the military.

1143
01:37:02.92 --> 01:37:08.92
You have to have some physical capability to put on a rock sack and go and walk for a long period of time.

1144
01:37:08.92 --> 01:37:12.92
You got to be able to do these certain physical activities.

1145
01:37:12.92 --> 01:37:14.92
And if it's apparent from looking at you that you can't do that,

1146
01:37:14.92 --> 01:37:16.92
respect is going down.

1147
01:37:16.92 --> 01:37:18.92
And by the way, this isn't me talking.

1148
01:37:18.92 --> 01:37:19.92
This isn't you talking.

1149
01:37:19.92 --> 01:37:23.92
This is what these thousands of soldiers that filled out this survey said,

1150
01:37:23.92 --> 01:37:25.92
Hey, physical strength and good build come next.

1151
01:37:25.92 --> 01:37:27.92
That's what's respected.

1152
01:37:27.92 --> 01:37:33.92
And it's definitely not mandatory because, I mean, Napoleon was like a tiny guy, right?

1153
01:37:33.92 --> 01:37:40.92
So it's not a mandatory thing, but don't be out of shape.

1154
01:37:40.92 --> 01:37:41.92
Yeah.

1155
01:37:41.92 --> 01:37:42.92
I can tell you that.

1156
01:37:42.92 --> 01:37:43.92
Yeah.

1157
01:37:43.92 --> 01:37:44.92
Get in shape.

1158
01:37:44.92 --> 01:37:45.92
Hey, get in shape.

1159
01:37:45.92 --> 01:37:46.92
How's that?

1160
01:37:46.92 --> 01:37:47.92
If you're not in shape, get in shape.

1161
01:37:47.92 --> 01:37:49.92
It'll be better for you as a leader.

1162
01:37:49.92 --> 01:37:51.92
It'll be better for you as a human being.

1163
01:37:51.92 --> 01:37:52.92
It'll help everything that you're doing.

1164
01:37:52.92 --> 01:37:54.92
So do it.

1165
01:37:54.92 --> 01:38:01.92
Number nine, good education, sense of humor, and guts or courage.

1166
01:38:01.92 --> 01:38:03.92
Number ten impartiality is next.

1167
01:38:03.92 --> 01:38:07.92
Leaders who do not save the dirty jobs for fellows.

1168
01:38:07.92 --> 01:38:08.92
They don't like our valued.

1169
01:38:08.92 --> 01:38:11.92
The good leader is fair to all in his command.

1170
01:38:11.92 --> 01:38:13.92
So be fair.

1171
01:38:13.92 --> 01:38:14.92
Common sense.

1172
01:38:14.92 --> 01:38:15.92
Which is.

1173
01:38:15.92 --> 01:38:17.92
God of the legislature.

1174
01:38:17.92 --> 01:38:20.92
Next important is industry.

1175
01:38:20.92 --> 01:38:23.92
Leaders who do his little work as they can get away with are not respected by the

1176
01:38:23.92 --> 01:38:25.92
enlisted men.

1177
01:38:25.92 --> 01:38:26.92
Yeah.

1178
01:38:26.92 --> 01:38:30.92
Don't be standing around with your hands in your pockets.

1179
01:38:30.92 --> 01:38:33.92
Just don't do that.

1180
01:38:33.92 --> 01:38:34.92
12.

1181
01:38:34.92 --> 01:38:44.92
When an officer gives orders in such a way that you clearly know what to do is a mark of merit as a leader.

1182
01:38:44.92 --> 01:38:49.92
Soldiers also like an officer with a clear strong voice.

1183
01:38:49.92 --> 01:38:52.92
There you go.

1184
01:38:52.92 --> 01:38:54.92
That makes sense.

1185
01:38:54.92 --> 01:38:58.92
The remaining qualities which the soldiers mentioned came toward the bottom of the list.

1186
01:38:58.92 --> 01:39:03.92
They are undoubtedly related to good leadership, but they are less important.

1187
01:39:03.92 --> 01:39:06.92
Not hot tempered.

1188
01:39:06.92 --> 01:39:09.92
Do not drive you too hard.

1189
01:39:09.92 --> 01:39:11.92
Keep promises.

1190
01:39:11.92 --> 01:39:14.92
The kind of fellows you could have a good time with.

1191
01:39:14.92 --> 01:39:16.92
Not too proud of their rank.

1192
01:39:16.92 --> 01:39:21.92
Are all characteristics which some men want in their leaders, but there is no general agreement about them.

1193
01:39:21.92 --> 01:39:26.92
Many leaders are considered good in spite of failures on these parts.

1194
01:39:26.92 --> 01:39:33.92
The chief things a man wants from a leader are thus competence and interest in his welfare.

1195
01:39:33.92 --> 01:39:36.92
The orders of a man who does not know his stuff cannot be dependent on.

1196
01:39:36.92 --> 01:39:39.92
They are subject to change in counterman.

1197
01:39:39.92 --> 01:39:44.92
An incompetent leader teaches caution and hesitation and following his lead.

1198
01:39:44.92 --> 01:39:48.92
He becomes a signal for lack of action on the part of the soldier.

1199
01:39:48.92 --> 01:39:53.92
In decision in a leader has the same effect on a soldier as ignorance has.

1200
01:39:53.92 --> 01:39:57.92
No soldier can follow a leader who is uncertain which way to turn.

1201
01:39:57.92 --> 01:40:01.92
The essential quality of any leader is to take lead and show the direction quickly,

1202
01:40:01.92 --> 01:40:04.92
clearly and radically and with enthusiasm.

1203
01:40:04.92 --> 01:40:09.92
Without these qualities a man is not even a good leader for his hunting dog.

1204
01:40:09.92 --> 01:40:16.92
Now, the interesting thing about that is there is a little dichotomy that reveals itself.

1205
01:40:16.92 --> 01:40:22.92
It's like, okay, you got to be decisive and give direction quickly clearly and radically.

1206
01:40:22.92 --> 01:40:25.92
That's great. That sounds good. What happens if you're not sure?

1207
01:40:25.92 --> 01:40:28.92
What happens if you're truly not sure which direction to go?

1208
01:40:28.92 --> 01:40:37.92
Then what you do is you say, hold up its former perimeter where we got to get a resection on the map.

1209
01:40:37.92 --> 01:40:42.92
That is so much better than say, and I will, we're going to push a little further.

1210
01:40:42.92 --> 01:40:46.92
You know what I mean? Like, I'm not really sure where we are and hold on and wait.

1211
01:40:46.92 --> 01:40:48.92
If you just go, hey, look, we're a little turned around right now.

1212
01:40:48.92 --> 01:40:50.92
We're going to need to read a couple resections. We're going to check the GPS.

1213
01:40:50.92 --> 01:40:53.92
Whatever we're going to do, we're going to find out exactly where we're going to move forward.

1214
01:40:53.92 --> 01:40:55.92
Take five. You know, everyone's uncle.

1215
01:40:55.92 --> 01:40:57.92
Jockel's got the son to rap. We're good.

1216
01:40:57.92 --> 01:40:59.92
I guess technically that is being decisive.

1217
01:40:59.92 --> 01:41:06.92
It is being decisive. Yes. You can be decisive in trying to uncover what the next move is going to be.

1218
01:41:06.92 --> 01:41:09.92
Because you're not sure. But sometimes people try and, you know,

1219
01:41:09.92 --> 01:41:15.92
be asked their way through a scenario like that. And that again, you're, you don't know what you're doing.

1220
01:41:15.92 --> 01:41:18.92
And you're proving that. So it's best to be true phones.

1221
01:41:18.92 --> 01:41:22.92
I look, we're turned around right now. We're going to form a perimeter.

1222
01:41:22.92 --> 01:41:25.92
We're going to cut a resection. We're going to find out where we are and then we're going to move.

1223
01:41:25.92 --> 01:41:28.92
You got 10 minutes. Boom, everyone's okay. Cool.

1224
01:41:28.92 --> 01:41:31.92
Good times.

1225
01:41:31.92 --> 01:41:39.92
So those, that is a great list of what people look for from leaders.

1226
01:41:39.92 --> 01:41:49.92
Ensure it's directed at the military, but almost every single one of those is equally applicable to any leadership position.

1227
01:41:49.92 --> 01:41:55.92
Next, the role of the soldier, part of what makes a man a good soldier is his own adoption of the soldier's role.

1228
01:41:55.92 --> 01:41:58.92
He comes to think and speak of himself as a soldier.

1229
01:41:58.92 --> 01:42:03.92
What a man thinks of himself affects his behavior. The rail straightener,

1230
01:42:03.92 --> 01:42:08.92
which is the skilled worker who runs the machine that straightens rail rail rails,

1231
01:42:08.92 --> 01:42:14.92
is one man when he thinks of himself with pride as a rail straightener.

1232
01:42:14.92 --> 01:42:21.92
He becomes another when he begins as he may to regard himself as a mirage slave.

1233
01:42:21.92 --> 01:42:24.92
The rail straightener takes pride in his work.

1234
01:42:24.92 --> 01:42:29.92
Does a good job is happy. The wage slave.

1235
01:42:29.92 --> 01:42:32.92
Let's crooked rails get by because he doesn't care.

1236
01:42:32.92 --> 01:42:39.92
In the same way, the soldier who thinks probably of himself as a soldier is doing a service to both himself and the army.

1237
01:42:39.92 --> 01:42:41.92
How smart is that?

1238
01:42:41.92 --> 01:42:42.92
It is very good.

1239
01:42:42.92 --> 01:42:49.92
It's like you're kind of introducing a sense of identity in their job like this with you.

1240
01:42:49.92 --> 01:42:54.92
People do that for themselves.

1241
01:42:54.92 --> 01:42:58.92
I remember some time, it's actually quite a while ago.

1242
01:42:58.92 --> 01:43:03.92
Somebody posted a picture of a very intricate plumbing job.

1243
01:43:03.92 --> 01:43:06.92
It was like 8 million copper pipes.

1244
01:43:06.92 --> 01:43:09.92
Perfectly spaced. Coming in, I was like this dude is plop.

1245
01:43:09.92 --> 01:43:10.92
It's like a plumber.

1246
01:43:10.92 --> 01:43:12.92
It's legit.

1247
01:43:12.92 --> 01:43:19.92
So, yes, if you are in a job, get into the job.

1248
01:43:19.92 --> 01:43:24.92
Let me tell you this, if you're not into the job and you want to get out of the job,

1249
01:43:24.92 --> 01:43:28.92
the best way for you to get out of the job is by getting into the job.

1250
01:43:28.92 --> 01:43:31.92
You're doing something that you don't care about, care about it.

1251
01:43:31.92 --> 01:43:33.92
Because otherwise people look like you, why would I promote you?

1252
01:43:33.92 --> 01:43:36.92
You can't even dig this ditch correctly.

1253
01:43:36.92 --> 01:43:41.92
If you're out there digging that ditch, like you mean it, like you make trying to make a perfect ditch in the world,

1254
01:43:41.92 --> 01:43:43.92
you're doing it.

1255
01:43:43.92 --> 01:43:45.92
Yeah.

1256
01:43:45.92 --> 01:43:55.92
Certain forms of punishment, public disgrace, ridicule, all disturb the role of the soldier and may lessen or destroy his usefulness to the army and his amenability to leadership.

1257
01:43:55.92 --> 01:44:04.92
The non-commissioned or commission officer who rides one of his men in such a manner as to make him doubt his own value as a soldier is shadowing the man's best motive for good performance.

1258
01:44:04.92 --> 01:44:10.92
The senior leader who recommends a junior in the presence of his men reduces that junior's value to the army.

1259
01:44:10.92 --> 01:44:17.92
Almost never good to belittle someone in front of the team.

1260
01:44:17.92 --> 01:44:24.92
Good leadership on the other hand causes men to build up each for himself, a particular role, a specialty.

1261
01:44:24.92 --> 01:44:33.92
It means a great deal to a man to take pride in being a soldier, into being a sharpshooter, an aviation mechanic, a truck driver, a cook, a radio operator,

1262
01:44:33.92 --> 01:44:43.92
competent leaders, criticise a poor piece of work, condemn a mistake, but never take care of it, never make a soldier feel he is a failure at his job.

1263
01:44:43.92 --> 01:44:52.92
So you can criticize the mistake that they made, but don't criticize their ability in that job.

1264
01:44:52.92 --> 01:45:02.92
When a soldier begins to regard himself as being part of his unit and when his job has become part of his role, then teamwork is enormously improved.

1265
01:45:02.92 --> 01:45:15.92
The soldier who thinks of himself as only a private temporarily on this or that assignment is a different man from the soldier who thinks of himself as a necessary member of his outfit.

1266
01:45:15.92 --> 01:45:20.92
Good information. And here's how we get selection of leaders.

1267
01:45:20.92 --> 01:45:36.92
Rank is no guarantee of the ability to judge leadership in others, nor are good leaders necessarily competent to assess good leadership in others. The test of competent judge is his successful predictions in the past.

1268
01:45:36.92 --> 01:45:45.92
So you might be the highest ranking guy, but that doesn't mean he can necessarily figure out who's going to be a good leader, unless you show repetitively that you can select good leaders.

1269
01:45:45.92 --> 01:46:00.92
The interview itself is not a fair or accurate test of the soldier. The man who would make a good leader may be a modest man who fails in an interview to exhibit those qualities that would make his men believe in him, trust him and admire him.

1270
01:46:00.92 --> 01:46:11.92
And the man who could never secure the loyalty of subordinates may nevertheless be by assurance and poise by voice and manner, mislead in experience judges as to his capacity.

1271
01:46:11.92 --> 01:46:24.92
So all the time I get asked, what should I interview? What should I ask? You can only figure out so much fruit. When I get asked that, I always say, okay, who and here fought they were hiring the best guy that they've ever hired and he turned out to be a loser.

1272
01:46:24.92 --> 01:46:35.92
And everyone raises their hand. And how many times have you taken a chance on someone that you didn't want to share if they're going to work out and they turned out to be a stud. Everyone raises their hand. It's really hard to judge who's going to work well and who's not.

1273
01:46:35.92 --> 01:46:44.92
And that kind of goes for friends too. You know how like there are men that happens all the time where you meet someone and you just, you don't really feel them that much, but they end up being your best friend or something like that.

1274
01:46:44.92 --> 01:46:47.92
Like years later or something like that. It's weird like that.

1275
01:46:47.92 --> 01:46:56.92
Like certain situations, even certain first impressions, you know that are like, you know, indicate the long haul, you know?

1276
01:46:56.92 --> 01:46:57.92
Yeah.

1277
01:46:57.92 --> 01:46:59.92
Yeah.

1278
01:46:59.92 --> 01:47:07.92
It takes a little time to uncover what people are really about really about in many cases. I can tell you like, I feel pretty good about judging people.

1279
01:47:07.92 --> 01:47:08.92
Yeah.

1280
01:47:08.92 --> 01:47:10.92
And I'm probably like 70% accurate.

1281
01:47:10.92 --> 01:47:12.92
You know, so that's not a great. Like I feel pretty good about it.

1282
01:47:12.92 --> 01:47:15.92
But I know that I'm only batten 70%

1283
01:47:15.92 --> 01:47:17.92
Yeah, which is like a sea.

1284
01:47:17.92 --> 01:47:28.92
But the, I wonder if, and do you think this, do you think that there's certain things that are maybe even subconscious about people that you can sort of tell after just talking on for a long time?

1285
01:47:28.92 --> 01:47:29.92
Yeah.

1286
01:47:29.92 --> 01:47:43.92
I got asked to, this just popped up my mind. I got asked. I was at a event. And it wasn't, it was an interesting event. It wasn't with a specific company, which normally I'm working with a company.

1287
01:47:43.92 --> 01:47:47.92
And I was just at an event where I was speaking to multiple different companies.

1288
01:47:47.92 --> 01:47:57.92
And, and this woman stood up to ask her question and as soon as she stood up, I was like, this is going to be, she, she does not want to hear my answer no matter what I say.

1289
01:47:57.92 --> 01:48:02.92
She just stood up with just arrogance dripping off her.

1290
01:48:02.92 --> 01:48:07.92
And, and just I was, no, she's not going to, she's not going to like this answer.

1291
01:48:07.92 --> 01:48:13.92
Whatever that's right. If whatever question she asks, she is not, she's not listening.

1292
01:48:13.92 --> 01:48:16.92
So that, that thought that you had right there, went into the book.

1293
01:48:16.92 --> 01:48:17.92
And then she was correct.

1294
01:48:17.92 --> 01:48:18.92
Yeah.

1295
01:48:18.92 --> 01:48:23.92
It was basically when she stood up and then three words out of a mouth.

1296
01:48:23.92 --> 01:48:26.92
Yeah, we're just like, I was like, oh, yeah, come here.

1297
01:48:26.92 --> 01:48:27.92
Yeah.

1298
01:48:27.92 --> 01:48:35.92
And it's also interesting because, you know, she just, when you're working with a single company, they're all kind of on board.

1299
01:48:35.92 --> 01:48:39.92
And they're all kind of like there, maybe they're not on board with what you're saying,

1300
01:48:39.92 --> 01:48:43.92
but they're unified as a group lying to move in a certain direction.

1301
01:48:43.92 --> 01:48:44.92
Yeah.

1302
01:48:44.92 --> 01:48:49.92
So we have a random group of people and the woman stands up and I could tell right away, yep, she's got it.

1303
01:48:49.92 --> 01:48:52.92
She does, she, there's no answer I'm going to give her that's going to make her happy.

1304
01:48:52.92 --> 01:48:57.92
Yeah. What did it feel like it was like subconscious, like was it like, or were you like see the visual care?

1305
01:48:57.92 --> 01:48:58.92
No visual care.

1306
01:48:58.92 --> 01:48:59.92
It was visual cues.

1307
01:48:59.92 --> 01:49:05.92
And then, you know, the opening of the question, I can't remember what it was, but it was like, oh, yes, confirmed.

1308
01:49:05.92 --> 01:49:06.92
Yeah.

1309
01:49:06.92 --> 01:49:07.92
Let me tell you something.

1310
01:49:07.92 --> 01:49:08.92
It was one of those.

1311
01:49:08.92 --> 01:49:09.92
It was one of those.

1312
01:49:09.92 --> 01:49:15.92
You know, and so what I did was I preempted my answer and I said, you're, you know, because then she asked the question.

1313
01:49:15.92 --> 01:49:16.92
Mm-hmm.

1314
01:49:16.92 --> 01:49:21.92
And I said, you're actually not going to like my answer to this question, but I'm just going to tell you what I've seen.

1315
01:49:21.92 --> 01:49:23.92
And I appreciate the question.

1316
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:25.92
And then I answered the question.

1317
01:49:25.92 --> 01:49:27.92
And of course, she didn't like the answer.

1318
01:49:27.92 --> 01:49:27.92
Mm-hmm.

1319
01:49:27.92 --> 01:49:36.92
You know, you know, you know, I shouldn't like the answer because the answer was the leadership question and the problem with the people that you're having is not a problem with the people that you have.

1320
01:49:36.92 --> 01:49:37.92
It's a problem with you.

1321
01:49:37.92 --> 01:49:40.92
Which is the way it is with all leadership problems.

1322
01:49:40.92 --> 01:49:44.92
When you have a problem with your team, your team isn't performing the way you want them to do.

1323
01:49:44.92 --> 01:49:46.92
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, oh, they're lazy.

1324
01:49:46.92 --> 01:49:48.92
Oh, they don't do the mission correctly.

1325
01:49:48.92 --> 01:49:51.92
Well, who's fault is that? You're the leader.

1326
01:49:51.92 --> 01:49:52.92
Yeah.

1327
01:49:52.92 --> 01:49:53.92
You're the leader in charge of the people.

1328
01:49:53.92 --> 01:49:59.92
So if they're not doing the mission that you want them to execute it or how you want them to execute it, you can't blame them.

1329
01:49:59.92 --> 01:50:01.92
They literally work for you.

1330
01:50:01.92 --> 01:50:03.92
You are the boss of them.

1331
01:50:03.92 --> 01:50:04.92
Mm-hmm.

1332
01:50:04.92 --> 01:50:08.92
So let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, do you want to explain to me how you give them the direction?

1333
01:50:08.92 --> 01:50:12.92
You want to talk to me about like, what, what sort of direction you give them?

1334
01:50:12.92 --> 01:50:14.92
How you communicate with them?

1335
01:50:14.92 --> 01:50:16.92
And we went down that road, you know?

1336
01:50:16.92 --> 01:50:21.92
But at the end of the day, she sat down with no, she took nothing I said on board.

1337
01:50:21.92 --> 01:50:22.92
Zero.

1338
01:50:22.92 --> 01:50:23.92
Mm-hmm.

1339
01:50:23.92 --> 01:50:25.92
And, and this is a fairly rare occasion.

1340
01:50:25.92 --> 01:50:27.92
You know, that's why I remember.

1341
01:50:27.92 --> 01:50:28.92
This was a couple years ago.

1342
01:50:28.92 --> 01:50:31.92
But I remember it because I thought, yep, she didn't, she's, when she stood up, I said,

1343
01:50:31.92 --> 01:50:33.92
up, she's not listening to me.

1344
01:50:33.92 --> 01:50:36.92
And then, she's not going to like my answer.

1345
01:50:36.92 --> 01:50:39.92
And then, when she sat down, I said, yep, she's going to walk out of here and go,

1346
01:50:39.92 --> 01:50:41.92
I got into no one who was talking about.

1347
01:50:41.92 --> 01:50:42.92
Yeah.

1348
01:50:42.92 --> 01:50:45.92
It's not, it's not my, it's not my problem that my team is all jacked up.

1349
01:50:45.92 --> 01:50:48.92
It's not my, it's not my fault that my team is lazy.

1350
01:50:48.92 --> 01:50:53.92
One of her key components of her statement was that her team was lazy.

1351
01:50:53.92 --> 01:50:53.92
Yeah.

1352
01:50:53.92 --> 01:50:56.92
And they weren't meeting the standards.

1353
01:50:56.92 --> 01:51:01.92
And the answer to that question is, you know, beat them harder because that doesn't work.

1354
01:51:01.92 --> 01:51:07.92
The answer to that question is, you, as a leader, are not doing a good job of leading them.

1355
01:51:07.92 --> 01:51:14.92
Or there is a chance that your team is completely incompetent and you need to train them or get rid of them.

1356
01:51:14.92 --> 01:51:20.92
Guess what both of those things are, your responsibility, your leader, you need to train them or you need to get rid of them.

1357
01:51:20.92 --> 01:51:23.92
So, worst answer in the world.

1358
01:51:23.92 --> 01:51:26.92
Yeah, it's the worst answer in the world.

1359
01:51:26.92 --> 01:51:28.92
It hurts, you know, Lave talks about this.

1360
01:51:28.92 --> 01:51:34.92
Lave talks about like when he was, like when he's writing, no bad teams only bad leaders.

1361
01:51:34.92 --> 01:51:39.92
He's literally thinking about things that he did where he was blaming his team.

1362
01:51:39.92 --> 01:51:44.92
And he's just looking back on, here I was blaming my team and none of it was my fault.

1363
01:51:44.92 --> 01:51:47.92
And that's the revelation you had.

1364
01:51:47.92 --> 01:51:52.92
Yeah, but I've seen literally witness this in the, like a bunch of times,

1365
01:51:52.92 --> 01:51:57.92
to where people would stand up, which with what I thought was sort of that sort of feel.

1366
01:51:57.92 --> 01:52:02.92
That tone like, oh, like they're just going to stump you, Mr. Perth, Mr. Know it all.

1367
01:52:02.92 --> 01:52:04.92
You know, kind of attitude.

1368
01:52:04.92 --> 01:52:07.92
And then you tell them that answer.

1369
01:52:07.92 --> 01:52:13.92
Like it's like, hey, it's your responsibility, you know, and then it, I can see their mind just totally changing.

1370
01:52:13.92 --> 01:52:14.92
Yeah. And they accepted it.

1371
01:52:14.92 --> 01:52:24.92
And actually going back to this moment when I was talking to this woman, I immediately tried to like frame it in the most humble way to not offend her ego.

1372
01:52:24.92 --> 01:52:27.92
You know, when I told, when I told her, you know, you're not going to like the answer. I give you.

1373
01:52:27.92 --> 01:52:33.92
I didn't say it like that. I was like, look, I'm going to give you an answer that I, I got a feeling you're probably not even going to like the answer.

1374
01:52:33.92 --> 01:52:42.92
But I just going to tell you kind of what I've seen, you know, so I tried to do my best to not hit her ego in the face.

1375
01:52:42.92 --> 01:52:48.92
The problem was her ego was big and strong and dug in and leading the way.

1376
01:52:48.92 --> 01:52:50.92
And it was leading out front.

1377
01:52:50.92 --> 01:52:53.92
And so it was, you know, and that always bombs me out.

1378
01:52:53.92 --> 01:52:56.92
And it doesn't happen very often. Like I said, I mean, this is two years ago or something like that.

1379
01:52:56.92 --> 01:52:58.92
And I'm remembering this person asks in this question.

1380
01:52:58.92 --> 01:53:02.92
I remember thinking myself, that she doesn't want to hear what I'm going to do.

1381
01:53:02.92 --> 01:53:07.92
What she wanted me to say is, yeah, you're right. Your team is so horrible.

1382
01:53:07.92 --> 01:53:14.92
And the exception, you know, they probably just hate, you know, the world and they don't want to do good.

1383
01:53:14.92 --> 01:53:17.92
Like, like, you know what it is? They probably don't want to do a good job.

1384
01:53:17.92 --> 01:53:21.92
They probably don't want to get promoted. They probably don't want to make any extra money.

1385
01:53:21.92 --> 01:53:24.92
They probably want to go home unsatisfied with your job.

1386
01:53:24.92 --> 01:53:26.92
That's there. That's there.

1387
01:53:26.92 --> 01:53:27.92
That's there.

1388
01:53:27.92 --> 01:53:28.92
Right.

1389
01:53:28.92 --> 01:53:31.92
And I'm sorry that you've been burdened with this horrible team that feels that way.

1390
01:53:31.92 --> 01:53:32.92
Yeah.

1391
01:53:32.92 --> 01:53:38.92
Right. Because that's absolutely true. You don't have a whole. You might have one or two people on your team that aren't very enthusiastic.

1392
01:53:38.92 --> 01:53:42.92
But you're not going to have a whole team that no one wants to do good job.

1393
01:53:42.92 --> 01:53:46.92
No one wants to put it in any extra effort. No one wants to work hard.

1394
01:53:46.92 --> 01:53:51.92
But you don't have a whole team like that. And by the way, if you do have a team like that,

1395
01:53:51.92 --> 01:53:53.92
guess what?

1396
01:53:53.92 --> 01:54:00.92
It is your responsibility to get rid of those members that don't want to do what they need to do.

1397
01:54:00.92 --> 01:54:01.92
To win.

1398
01:54:01.92 --> 01:54:09.92
Yeah. A lot of times when it happens, when I lead people down that question,

1399
01:54:09.92 --> 01:54:13.92
they'll be like, hey, I got this department and I'll say, oh, okay.

1400
01:54:13.92 --> 01:54:17.92
Well, I got this department and they got these middle-level managers and they're horrible.

1401
01:54:17.92 --> 01:54:21.92
I'm like, oh, that's terrible. Who's in charge of the middle-level managers?

1402
01:54:21.92 --> 01:54:25.92
Oh, well, it's this guy. Oh, okay. Who's in charge of that guy? Oh, this other guy. Who's in charge of that guy?

1403
01:54:25.92 --> 01:54:28.92
Well, I am.

1404
01:54:28.92 --> 01:54:31.92
Okay. So who's fault is this?

1405
01:54:31.92 --> 01:54:32.92
Yeah.

1406
01:54:32.92 --> 01:54:34.92
It's your fault.

1407
01:54:34.92 --> 01:54:35.92
Yeah.

1408
01:54:35.92 --> 01:54:36.92
It's truly your fault.

1409
01:54:36.92 --> 01:54:40.92
It's funny. You'll do this technique, which I always find pretty impressive,

1410
01:54:40.92 --> 01:54:41.92
like as far as a little kid.

1411
01:54:41.92 --> 01:54:44.92
It's almost like a, it's not a chess game because it's not you against the

1412
01:54:44.92 --> 01:54:48.92
asker of the question, but there's an element to it.

1413
01:54:48.92 --> 01:54:52.92
Just like that. Like how you like make a man's or their own questions kind of thing.

1414
01:54:52.92 --> 01:54:57.92
Where, but you go, um, you'll say, oh, do you think that they just want to do a bad job?

1415
01:54:57.92 --> 01:55:02.92
And I'm like, oh, no, no, no, nothing like that. Oh, do you think that like, um, that they want your company to fail?

1416
01:55:02.92 --> 01:55:04.92
You know, it's those questions.

1417
01:55:04.92 --> 01:55:08.92
Yeah, that goes up and down the chain of command too, because some of that moment bounces into this.

1418
01:55:08.92 --> 01:55:10.92
Do you think your boss wants to lower your profitability?

1419
01:55:10.92 --> 01:55:13.92
Yeah. Do you think your boss wants to do things that are less safe?

1420
01:55:13.92 --> 01:55:13.92
Yeah.

1421
01:55:13.92 --> 01:55:16.92
Think your boss wants you to have people leaving on a regular basis.

1422
01:55:16.92 --> 01:55:18.92
Do you think your boss wants more turnover?

1423
01:55:18.92 --> 01:55:20.92
Do you think your boss, you go right down the list?

1424
01:55:20.92 --> 01:55:20.92
Yeah.

1425
01:55:20.92 --> 01:55:21.92
Of course it's no, no, no, no, no, no.

1426
01:55:21.92 --> 01:55:23.92
And eventually realize, oh, okay.

1427
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:23.92
Yeah.

1428
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:27.92
Yeah, the problem here is it's not communicating well enough to explain to my boss what I need.

1429
01:55:27.92 --> 01:55:28.92
Yes.

1430
01:55:28.92 --> 01:55:29.92
So it's a good one.

1431
01:55:29.92 --> 01:55:34.92
But it's good to also not only as like something fun to kind of watch or whatever,

1432
01:55:34.92 --> 01:55:36.92
but, you know, so you watch them kind of gain understanding.

1433
01:55:36.92 --> 01:55:38.92
That is cool for sure.

1434
01:55:38.92 --> 01:55:44.92
But it helps because it helps even me or people listening, like, put it into perspective.

1435
01:55:44.92 --> 01:55:46.92
You know, like, man, no one's against you, right?

1436
01:55:46.92 --> 01:55:49.92
Like, you just, you just, hey, you know,

1437
01:55:49.92 --> 01:55:53.92
make some right moves and say some right things in man, get it, just get on the same page.

1438
01:55:53.92 --> 01:55:56.92
And by the way, most of the time when someone is against you,

1439
01:55:56.92 --> 01:55:59.92
because there are times, you know, you got that person that's a,

1440
01:55:59.92 --> 01:56:02.92
uh, just wants to get promoted and they're looking to step all the way.

1441
01:56:02.92 --> 01:56:07.92
It's like, do a good job, do a great job, keep working hard.

1442
01:56:07.92 --> 01:56:09.92
Make them look good.

1443
01:56:09.92 --> 01:56:10.92
What are you talking about?

1444
01:56:10.92 --> 01:56:12.92
No, you make them look good.

1445
01:56:12.92 --> 01:56:14.92
It will come back.

1446
01:56:14.92 --> 01:56:17.92
It will come back.

1447
01:56:17.92 --> 01:56:20.92
Back to the book.

1448
01:56:20.92 --> 01:56:25.92
The only proof of leadership is leadership.

1449
01:56:25.92 --> 01:56:29.92
And the best thing to do is give it a chance to emerge and then have

1450
01:56:29.92 --> 01:56:32.92
competent men judge whether it has appeared.

1451
01:56:32.92 --> 01:56:38.92
So this is another, it's just hard to know what people are like until you actually put them in the situation.

1452
01:56:38.92 --> 01:56:41.92
Although young men can make excellent leaders,

1453
01:56:41.92 --> 01:56:43.92
leadership develops with experience.

1454
01:56:43.92 --> 01:56:45.92
No doubt about that.

1455
01:56:45.92 --> 01:56:50.92
It is known more over that the men of a platoon can size each other up effectively,

1456
01:56:50.92 --> 01:56:55.92
can pick out men who deserve advancement more consistently than leaders can.

1457
01:56:55.92 --> 01:56:57.92
The men know competence when they see it.

1458
01:56:57.92 --> 01:57:01.92
Vossita appears at the officer who fails to find out quietly the opinions of his

1459
01:57:01.92 --> 01:57:05.92
subordinates when he is selecting a man for promotion is overlooking a valid

1460
01:57:05.92 --> 01:57:06.92
source of information.

1461
01:57:06.92 --> 01:57:11.92
One that is in the long run, far more accurate than his own judgement.

1462
01:57:11.92 --> 01:57:14.92
So listen to your people.

1463
01:57:14.92 --> 01:57:18.92
Lead next section.

1464
01:57:18.92 --> 01:57:22.92
Very important or important.

1465
01:57:22.92 --> 01:57:26.92
Leadership can be learned.

1466
01:57:26.92 --> 01:57:28.92
There are no born leaders.

1467
01:57:28.92 --> 01:57:32.92
All leadership is based on learning how to deal with men.

1468
01:57:32.92 --> 01:57:36.92
Nearly all leaders improve after they have had some experience in command.

1469
01:57:36.92 --> 01:57:39.92
Some improve faster than others and some continue to improve.

1470
01:57:39.92 --> 01:57:42.92
All others do not.

1471
01:57:42.92 --> 01:57:46.92
So there are no born leaders.

1472
01:57:46.92 --> 01:57:47.92
Okay.

1473
01:57:47.92 --> 01:57:49.92
We know my debate on this.

1474
01:57:49.92 --> 01:57:51.92
I actually disagree with that.

1475
01:57:51.92 --> 01:57:52.92
Well, I should say this.

1476
01:57:52.92 --> 01:57:54.92
Okay, there might not be born leaders,

1477
01:57:54.92 --> 01:58:00.92
but there are people that are born with certain aptitudes with for a variety of

1478
01:58:00.92 --> 01:58:05.92
leadership qualities and somebody posted something on social media.

1479
01:58:05.92 --> 01:58:08.92
That said, there is an edgine.

1480
01:58:08.92 --> 01:58:16.92
That you have or don't have as a human being that relates to your ability to articulate.

1481
01:58:16.92 --> 01:58:18.92
So guess what?

1482
01:58:18.92 --> 01:58:20.92
If you are born with that dream,

1483
01:58:20.92 --> 01:58:26.92
gene and you have a high level ability to articulate and communicate with other human beings,

1484
01:58:26.92 --> 01:58:30.92
you are born with more aptitude to become a leader.

1485
01:58:30.92 --> 01:58:32.92
Could you end up still being a terrible leader?

1486
01:58:32.92 --> 01:58:35.92
Yes, because there are some people that are very articulate that are horrible leaders.

1487
01:58:35.92 --> 01:58:39.92
But it is one attribute that you are born with.

1488
01:58:39.92 --> 01:58:41.92
Doesn't necessarily make you a leader.

1489
01:58:41.92 --> 01:58:43.92
It gives you more aptitude to be a leader.

1490
01:58:43.92 --> 01:58:44.92
So maybe that is correct.

1491
01:58:44.92 --> 01:58:48.92
You're not born a leader, but you're born with a little more aptitude to be a leader.

1492
01:58:48.92 --> 01:58:50.92
Back to the book.

1493
01:58:50.92 --> 01:58:54.92
Consider the qualities which enlisted men believe important in leaders.

1494
01:58:54.92 --> 01:58:57.92
The first is competency and ability.

1495
01:58:57.92 --> 01:58:59.92
Competence is based on learning.

1496
01:58:59.92 --> 01:59:01.92
The good leader has learned his job thoroughly.

1497
01:59:01.92 --> 01:59:02.92
So there you go.

1498
01:59:02.92 --> 01:59:03.92
That makes sense.

1499
01:59:03.92 --> 01:59:05.92
His men can trust him to know what he's doing.

1500
01:59:05.92 --> 01:59:08.92
He knows not only what he learned in his training courses,

1501
01:59:08.92 --> 01:59:09.92
but he's kept it up to date.

1502
01:59:09.92 --> 01:59:13.92
If he is an artilleryman, he knows how the Germans use artillery.

1503
01:59:13.92 --> 01:59:14.92
And what guns they have?

1504
01:59:14.92 --> 01:59:16.92
The rule is a simple one.

1505
01:59:16.92 --> 01:59:17.92
Know your stuff.

1506
01:59:17.92 --> 01:59:18.92
So that I agree with.

1507
01:59:18.92 --> 01:59:21.92
You learn to be competent.

1508
01:59:21.92 --> 01:59:26.92
Second to competence is the officer's interest in the soldier as a man.

1509
01:59:26.92 --> 01:59:32.92
A demonstrated interest that gives the soldier confidence that when he stands up to hardship or is in trouble.

1510
01:59:32.92 --> 01:59:37.92
The hardship is a necessary part of the job and his troubles.

1511
01:59:37.92 --> 01:59:39.92
Give his officer.

1512
01:59:39.92 --> 01:59:41.92
Concern, so you got to care about your people.

1513
01:59:41.92 --> 01:59:43.92
And what's interesting about this whole section?

1514
01:59:43.92 --> 01:59:46.92
If you remember, this is saying there's no born leaders,

1515
01:59:46.92 --> 01:59:50.92
but there's a whole section in the first part of this book that talks about.

1516
01:59:50.92 --> 01:59:56.92
People men have different aptitudes and skills that they either have or they don't have.

1517
01:59:56.92 --> 01:59:59.92
And some of how to do if you know you were a truck driver in the civilian sector,

1518
01:59:59.92 --> 02:00:02.92
so you're going to make a good truck driver in the military.

1519
02:00:02.92 --> 02:00:08.92
But it also talks about how some people don't have the aptitude for certain jobs.

1520
02:00:08.92 --> 02:00:11.92
So they're being a little bit hypocritical here.

1521
02:00:11.92 --> 02:00:14.92
It's a little bit.

1522
02:00:14.92 --> 02:00:17.92
Okay, so we're talking about caring about people and here it says,

1523
02:00:17.92 --> 02:00:22.92
Every man can buy can by practice, improve his skill in human understanding and increases

1524
02:00:22.92 --> 02:00:26.92
repertoire of actions that demonstrate interest in others.

1525
02:00:26.92 --> 02:00:29.92
The rule here is less simple.

1526
02:00:29.92 --> 02:00:31.92
It is, know your man and show it.

1527
02:00:31.92 --> 02:00:36.92
Know their names, their history, their weaknesses, their good points, their morale.

1528
02:00:36.92 --> 02:00:39.92
Begin by studying their qualification cards.

1529
02:00:39.92 --> 02:00:43.92
So that's another skill that you can get better at.

1530
02:00:43.92 --> 02:00:50.92
Decisiveness is a skill harder to acquire, but it can with attention be cultivated.

1531
02:00:50.92 --> 02:00:55.92
When you have a hard choice, remember you do not usually have to make a snap judgment.

1532
02:00:55.92 --> 02:01:01.92
Careful consideration, weighing the merits of alternate courses is not in decision.

1533
02:01:01.92 --> 02:01:04.92
Your men will respect your judgment even more if you deserve,

1534
02:01:04.92 --> 02:01:10.92
if you reserve decision until you are in possession of all the facts necessary for a wise choice.

1535
02:01:10.92 --> 02:01:15.92
Do not set up a council of war to pass things by vote.

1536
02:01:15.92 --> 02:01:22.92
You are the leader, but seek advice when you need it and do not hesitate to call in your subordinates for council.

1537
02:01:22.92 --> 02:01:28.92
If they are qualified to give it, but choose your course before you give the orders which we already heard.

1538
02:01:28.92 --> 02:01:35.92
So this is also a little bit contrary, or not contrary, but this is an adendom to what was being said earlier

1539
02:01:35.92 --> 02:01:36.92
than you got to be decisive.

1540
02:01:36.92 --> 02:01:40.92
And here is saying, look, you got to be decisive, but you can take your time.

1541
02:01:40.92 --> 02:01:44.92
You want to measure everything out.

1542
02:01:44.92 --> 02:01:57.92
Another suggestion to the leader is, remember when your men do not understand you that it is your fault.

1543
02:01:57.92 --> 02:02:02.92
You must talk their language, plain language.

1544
02:02:02.92 --> 02:02:07.92
If you cannot express yourself clearly, it may be because you do not understand the subject yourself.

1545
02:02:07.92 --> 02:02:11.92
Think things through carefully before you try to explain.

1546
02:02:11.92 --> 02:02:16.92
So there you go, a little extreme ownership, a little simplicity in there.

1547
02:02:16.92 --> 02:02:22.92
A leader then to be worthy in the eyes of his men would do well to follow these commands.

1548
02:02:22.92 --> 02:02:25.92
Number one, be competent.

1549
02:02:25.92 --> 02:02:31.92
Number two, be loyal to your men as well as to your country and army.

1550
02:02:31.92 --> 02:02:38.92
Number three, know your men, understand them, love them, be proud of them.

1551
02:02:38.92 --> 02:02:45.92
Number four, accept responsibility and give clear decisive orders.

1552
02:02:45.92 --> 02:02:52.92
Number five, teach your men by putting them through the necessary action.

1553
02:02:52.92 --> 02:03:01.92
Number six, give only necessary orders, but number seven, get things done.

1554
02:03:01.92 --> 02:03:04.92
Number eight, be fair.

1555
02:03:04.92 --> 02:03:08.92
Number nine, work hard.

1556
02:03:08.92 --> 02:03:13.92
Number ten, remember that a leader is a symbol.

1557
02:03:13.92 --> 02:03:16.92
Men need to respect and trust you.

1558
02:03:16.92 --> 02:03:20.92
Don't let them down.

1559
02:03:20.92 --> 02:03:24.92
So there you go, they wrap it all back into.

1560
02:03:24.92 --> 02:03:29.92
From everything we started, started this thing talking about when we were talking about discipline and obedience.

1561
02:03:29.92 --> 02:03:33.92
This whole thing about being a leader has nothing to do with obedience.

1562
02:03:33.92 --> 02:03:36.92
It has to do with being a good leader.

1563
02:03:36.92 --> 02:03:40.92
And that's how they wrap up that chapter.

1564
02:03:40.92 --> 02:03:43.92
That's solid information in there.

1565
02:03:43.92 --> 02:03:48.92
Now this next section is about mobs and panic.

1566
02:03:48.92 --> 02:03:55.92
And what's interesting about this is as a human being in charge of other human beings.

1567
02:03:55.92 --> 02:03:58.92
You have to understand how mobs and panic unfold.

1568
02:03:58.92 --> 02:04:02.92
Going back to the book, men in a mob act just as much in keeping with their past training and habits as they will.

1569
02:04:02.92 --> 02:04:17.92
If they were alone, but part of this training, which men get from early as childhood, is to follow the example of other individuals and also to respond to their gestures, facial expressions and tones of voice as well as other as well as the spoken words of others.

1570
02:04:17.92 --> 02:04:19.92
That's an interesting concept, isn't it?

1571
02:04:19.92 --> 02:04:21.92
And it's a little trick statement.

1572
02:04:21.92 --> 02:04:29.92
Because what it's saying is, hey, when you've got a mob of people, they are acting in accordance with how they've been trained.

1573
02:04:29.92 --> 02:04:32.92
But then you think yourself, well, in the army, then they will not act that way.

1574
02:04:32.92 --> 02:04:37.92
But then it goes on to say they've been trained since day one to imitate other people.

1575
02:04:37.92 --> 02:04:46.92
So you're actually fighting against the rest of their training when you're trying to get them to not do something that everyone else is doing.

1576
02:04:46.92 --> 02:04:52.92
And by the way, it's an important thing that usually is beneficial and it goes into some of that here.

1577
02:04:52.92 --> 02:04:57.92
When a soldier misunderstands a command, he starts to execute it as he interpreted it.

1578
02:04:57.92 --> 02:05:03.92
But suppose in the middle of a movement, he becomes suddenly aware that the other men and ranks are doing something very different.

1579
02:05:03.92 --> 02:05:07.92
Immediately he corrects his action to do what others are doing.

1580
02:05:07.92 --> 02:05:10.92
So most of the time it's beneficial, that little mob mentality.

1581
02:05:10.92 --> 02:05:18.92
In the same way, the sight of a leader running or galloping to the rear in a combat area may start a whole company heading after him on the double.

1582
02:05:18.92 --> 02:05:23.92
His example can become as much a command as or order as his words.

1583
02:05:23.92 --> 02:05:27.92
Mostly, it is a good thing that men naturally fall the example of others.

1584
02:05:27.92 --> 02:05:29.92
It makes the world run more smoothly.

1585
02:05:29.92 --> 02:05:34.92
Yet the good principle has vicious results when mob's form or panic starts.

1586
02:05:34.92 --> 02:05:36.92
Why mob's form?

1587
02:05:36.92 --> 02:05:43.92
Because some one event or condition has brought people together and captured the attention of every person in the crowd.

1588
02:05:43.92 --> 02:05:49.92
Usually the mob is angry about something and it is, and its angry excitement makes it ready for action.

1589
02:05:49.92 --> 02:05:52.92
Panic based on fear is something else.

1590
02:05:52.92 --> 02:06:00.92
So the differentiated between the mob that is angry and the mob that is afraid that's panicking.

1591
02:06:00.92 --> 02:06:03.92
Besides a common focus of attention, so that's one element.

1592
02:06:03.92 --> 02:06:05.92
It's a common focus of attention.

1593
02:06:05.92 --> 02:06:10.92
Emotion is characteristic of all mobs since a mob is driven by powerful emotion.

1594
02:06:10.92 --> 02:06:13.92
It is necessarily crazy to do something.

1595
02:06:13.92 --> 02:06:21.92
It wants action, so it only takes a cry of lynch him or burn it to set the mob in motion.

1596
02:06:21.92 --> 02:06:26.92
Mostly, when you get into a crowd, you join it.

1597
02:06:26.92 --> 02:06:28.92
You do just what other people do.

1598
02:06:28.92 --> 02:06:37.92
The sight of others, seizing stones or starting an attack, so grips the men watching them that they think of no other course of action.

1599
02:06:37.92 --> 02:06:41.92
Mobs, therefore, are uncritical.

1600
02:06:41.92 --> 02:06:43.92
Interesting statements about mobs.

1601
02:06:43.92 --> 02:06:48.92
I'm trying to think, when have you been a part of a mob before?

1602
02:06:48.92 --> 02:06:51.92
I mean, in that regard now.

1603
02:06:51.92 --> 02:06:54.92
I've been at some shows, and by that, I mean, hard course, show is back.

1604
02:06:54.92 --> 02:07:00.92
The day where the mob would start to get something, you know, like whether it was breaking down a barrier.

1605
02:07:00.92 --> 02:07:06.92
And yeah, you get swept up in that mob mentality and it's group think.

1606
02:07:06.92 --> 02:07:08.92
This one's talking about panic.

1607
02:07:08.92 --> 02:07:10.92
Soldiers do not often form mobs.

1608
02:07:10.92 --> 02:07:16.92
Mob action among soldiers usually occurs when they are away from the usual reminders and circumstances of discipline.

1609
02:07:16.92 --> 02:07:20.92
When they are on leave and mingling with men from our organization's without leadership.

1610
02:07:20.92 --> 02:07:24.92
But panic can occur in the best drilled, thoroughly seasoned troops.

1611
02:07:24.92 --> 02:07:27.92
It can occur in the midst of combat.

1612
02:07:27.92 --> 02:07:31.92
Some of the greatest routes in history have been cases of panic.

1613
02:07:31.92 --> 02:07:36.92
The panic group is much like a mob, but it acts from fear, not anger.

1614
02:07:36.92 --> 02:07:39.92
Its attention is focused on the object of fear.

1615
02:07:39.92 --> 02:07:43.92
It's thought and its talk is of danger and disaster.

1616
02:07:43.92 --> 02:07:51.92
Its aim is escape. Action becomes definite and mob-like only when obstacles to escape are encountered.

1617
02:07:51.92 --> 02:07:58.92
It doesn't take much to set off a panic among troops who are panic ripe.

1618
02:07:58.92 --> 02:08:04.92
Men of single cry of gas or run or rear cut off may start a mad flight.

1619
02:08:04.92 --> 02:08:07.92
And here it talks about panic ripeness.

1620
02:08:07.92 --> 02:08:18.92
Anything that makes men tense on edge, jittery and over sensitive to slight noises, half hidden sights or sudden movements will make them easy victims of panic.

1621
02:08:18.92 --> 02:08:22.92
For this reason, prolonged anxiety makes men panic rip.

1622
02:08:22.92 --> 02:08:27.92
So does over fatigue, too much beer or liquor or a hangover.

1623
02:08:27.92 --> 02:08:31.92
So does lack of proper food, especially deficiency of b-vitemons.

1624
02:08:31.92 --> 02:08:41.92
And so does exhaustion from lack of sleep, prolonged exposure to noise and alarm of modern battle may produce the jumpy state of mind from which panic arises.

1625
02:08:41.92 --> 02:08:44.92
One main cause of panic is lack of training.

1626
02:08:44.92 --> 02:08:48.92
Training must cover practice and defense and retreat as well as in attack.

1627
02:08:48.92 --> 02:08:54.92
If panic is to be avoided, if the retreat is not to turn into a route.

1628
02:08:54.92 --> 02:08:57.92
The sight of one or several men running to the rear.

1629
02:08:57.92 --> 02:09:04.92
The sight of others throwing away their gear weapons may cause a general scramble and discarding of arms.

1630
02:09:04.92 --> 02:09:07.92
Bad morale is another cause of panic.

1631
02:09:07.92 --> 02:09:11.92
Rumors sometimes plays an important part in ready men for panic.

1632
02:09:11.92 --> 02:09:21.92
Poor leadership can make the ground ready for panic, impairing the confidence and command necessary to hold troops to the performance of duty.

1633
02:09:21.92 --> 02:09:23.92
How to stop a panic.

1634
02:09:23.92 --> 02:09:34.92
This is very important. Once a panic has begun, the only way to hold it is to capture attention and then provide positive clear commands.

1635
02:09:34.92 --> 02:09:38.92
Leaders must act with decision, firmness and courage.

1636
02:09:38.92 --> 02:09:47.92
If no officer is present, any self-possessed man can assume leadership and give the scared man what they need clear confident direction.

1637
02:09:47.92 --> 02:09:57.92
So I think the important part is to get their attention and then you have to give simple clear concise commands.

1638
02:09:57.92 --> 02:09:59.92
Positive commands.

1639
02:09:59.92 --> 02:10:04.92
And then it goes on to say, but the best way to stop a panic is never to have it at all.

1640
02:10:04.92 --> 02:10:09.92
Train all men thoroughly so that they have confidence in themselves, their leaders, their weapons.

1641
02:10:09.92 --> 02:10:12.92
Train their leaders and select the best of them.

1642
02:10:12.92 --> 02:10:19.92
Good leaders build up good morale, avoid hunger, thirst and boredom as much as possible to do in war.

1643
02:10:19.92 --> 02:10:24.92
And all the conditions that lead to nervous tension and complaint.

1644
02:10:24.92 --> 02:10:31.92
If you could not avoid them and war is no better roses, fight them with good morale, fight the feeling of insecurity.

1645
02:10:31.92 --> 02:10:35.92
Tell the men all they need to know, let them know all possible information about the enemy.

1646
02:10:35.92 --> 02:10:39.92
Where he is, what he's like, how he attacks, what weapons he is using.

1647
02:10:39.92 --> 02:10:41.92
Last but not least, build up faith.

1648
02:10:41.92 --> 02:10:45.92
Be sure the men know why they're fighting, why it is a good cause.

1649
02:10:45.92 --> 02:10:50.92
Let them be sure that their officers are with them all the way.

1650
02:10:50.92 --> 02:11:02.92
Faith in an ideal plus faith in your leaders plus faith in other fellows in your unit can win victory against superior forces.

1651
02:11:02.92 --> 02:11:06.92
So there you go, you got to watch out for that.

1652
02:11:06.92 --> 02:11:11.92
Next section, differences among races and peoples.

1653
02:11:11.92 --> 02:11:17.92
Modern total war has placed a new responsibility on the shoulders of the soldier.

1654
02:11:17.92 --> 02:11:24.92
Once his only task was to destroy the enemy, but now psychological warfare requires him to play a new role.

1655
02:11:24.92 --> 02:11:29.92
He must help win allies for uncle Sam in many strange lands.

1656
02:11:29.92 --> 02:11:30.92
And this is what's interesting.

1657
02:11:30.92 --> 02:11:32.92
We always think of World War.

1658
02:11:32.92 --> 02:11:35.92
Well, we think of World War II for sure as hey, this is total war.

1659
02:11:35.92 --> 02:11:39.92
You're not worried about hearts and minds, which was the campaign.

1660
02:11:39.92 --> 02:11:41.92
It really inviant on.

1661
02:11:41.92 --> 02:11:42.92
It was hearts and minds.

1662
02:11:42.92 --> 02:11:46.92
It's where that kind of originated and certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan.

1663
02:11:46.92 --> 02:11:49.92
We think all those guys do not have to deal with this back the day.

1664
02:11:49.92 --> 02:11:50.92
They have to deal with this.

1665
02:11:50.92 --> 02:11:53.92
Now we have to worry about the civilian populist and all this.

1666
02:11:53.92 --> 02:11:55.92
Guess what? We're wrong.

1667
02:11:55.92 --> 02:11:58.92
1942, they're talking about this.

1668
02:11:58.92 --> 02:12:05.92
And it goes into there are no infallible recipes for making friends the world around.

1669
02:12:05.92 --> 02:12:11.92
But there are two basic rules for all soldiers in the manual of psychological arms.

1670
02:12:11.92 --> 02:12:15.92
Number one, mind your manners.

1671
02:12:15.92 --> 02:12:25.92
Number two, understand and respect the manners of strangers, especially strangers who might help both you and the cause for which you're fighting.

1672
02:12:25.92 --> 02:12:27.92
Seems pretty obvious.

1673
02:12:27.92 --> 02:12:34.92
And no one thinks that in the world war II they had to watch their manners.

1674
02:12:34.92 --> 02:12:36.92
But you do.

1675
02:12:36.92 --> 02:12:38.92
Next one, talking about race.

1676
02:12:38.92 --> 02:12:45.92
Color of the skin is often the basis for prejudice because it is so clearly a badge of difference between peoples.

1677
02:12:45.92 --> 02:12:52.92
A mark that sets one people apart as different as not one of us.

1678
02:12:52.92 --> 02:13:01.92
American whites have been prejudiced not only against black skins, but also against yellow and against copper skins of the American Indian.

1679
02:13:01.92 --> 02:13:10.92
The United States excluded both japs and Chinese from immigration when our western states became afraid of their cheap labor.

1680
02:13:10.92 --> 02:13:19.92
And the old German Kaiser invented the slogan the yellow peril when he wished to unite Europe against the agiatics.

1681
02:13:19.92 --> 02:13:23.92
And the final interesting about this whole thing is this is 1942.

1682
02:13:23.92 --> 02:13:29.92
So this is pre civil rights movement in America.

1683
02:13:29.92 --> 02:13:35.92
And yet we find the military forward leaning on civil rights and we'll get to that.

1684
02:13:35.92 --> 02:13:41.92
Sometimes the prejudice against the Negroes flares up in the Army.

1685
02:13:41.92 --> 02:13:48.92
It is not a problem however in a camp where it is well understood that a soldier in the United States uniform is a soldier.

1686
02:13:48.92 --> 02:14:00.92
Not a white or a Negro, Christian or Jew, rich man or poor, but a soldier and as such worthy of respect.

1687
02:14:00.92 --> 02:14:02.92
And not everyone feels race-pregnest.

1688
02:14:02.92 --> 02:14:09.92
There are plenty of white men who are constantly meeting and working with black, brown and yellow men of education, culture, brains and ability.

1689
02:14:09.92 --> 02:14:14.92
These white men know that skin color is not a sign of inferiority or superiority.

1690
02:14:14.92 --> 02:14:20.92
And they tend to forget about it or at least to regard it as, or at least regarded as unimportant.

1691
02:14:20.92 --> 02:14:30.92
These white men are numerous in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa, where the races are mixed up in business and in politics.

1692
02:14:30.92 --> 02:14:38.92
The American soldier will be on the right track when he realizes that the differences are superficial.

1693
02:14:38.92 --> 02:14:43.92
That other races while different from his own are not necessarily inferior.

1694
02:14:43.92 --> 02:14:49.92
He will know that he cannot tell just from a man's color, whether that man will bind up his wounds,

1695
02:14:49.92 --> 02:14:56.92
Guide him to a hospital when he is lost, feed him if he is hungry or help him repel enemy invaders.

1696
02:14:56.92 --> 02:15:05.92
It will help him to remember that skin color in itself means nothing about the intelligence, wisdom, honesty, bravery or kindness of a man.

1697
02:15:05.92 --> 02:15:14.92
If he studies carefully the people of other races whom he meets, he can satisfy himself that this is true.

1698
02:15:14.92 --> 02:15:22.92
So again, 1942, pre-civil rights and the military saying, hey, guess what?

1699
02:15:22.92 --> 02:15:27.92
Folks, race doesn't matter.

1700
02:15:27.92 --> 02:15:32.92
And by the way, it's still a segregated army.

1701
02:15:32.92 --> 02:15:36.92
But they're moving in the right direction.

1702
02:15:36.92 --> 02:15:40.92
How to win friends in foreign lands?

1703
02:15:40.92 --> 02:15:44.92
Every American soldier in a foreign land becomes an American diplomat.

1704
02:15:44.92 --> 02:15:49.92
He has his role to play in making strange people into American's, American friends.

1705
02:15:49.92 --> 02:15:52.92
Here are some rules he will find helpful.

1706
02:15:52.92 --> 02:15:57.92
Again, this is so interesting to read because I'm telling you when you're in the military,

1707
02:15:57.92 --> 02:16:02.92
you think all these guys back in the 19th World War II didn't have to worry about that.

1708
02:16:02.92 --> 02:16:05.92
They just went over there, kicked ass!

1709
02:16:05.92 --> 02:16:07.92
And it's like, here they were, getting the briefs.

1710
02:16:07.92 --> 02:16:10.92
This is the brief. This is the big brief.

1711
02:16:10.92 --> 02:16:16.92
And here's some things that will help you be a good diplomat.

1712
02:16:16.92 --> 02:16:18.92
And this is applicable.

1713
02:16:18.92 --> 02:16:21.92
Like this is a point when you go and work with a new company.

1714
02:16:21.92 --> 02:16:23.92
Guess what?

1715
02:16:23.92 --> 02:16:26.92
You do want to win the hearts and minds.

1716
02:16:26.92 --> 02:16:28.92
There's a couple tips.

1717
02:16:28.92 --> 02:16:32.92
One, to try first of all, to understand strange customs, habits and ways of thinking.

1718
02:16:32.92 --> 02:16:35.92
Number two, respect these customs and habits of thought.

1719
02:16:35.92 --> 02:16:41.92
Even when you can't understand them and even when they seem unpleasant or a feminine or crazy.

1720
02:16:41.92 --> 02:16:51.92
Three, when you cannot respect foreign countries, then suppress your disapproval, stifle your emotions.

1721
02:16:51.92 --> 02:16:54.92
When you can respect foreign customs, show it.

1722
02:16:54.92 --> 02:16:58.92
You can win many friends for America in this simple way.

1723
02:16:58.92 --> 02:17:05.92
Five, when you associate with foreign people, try to adopt their manners, do not ask them to adopt yours.

1724
02:17:05.92 --> 02:17:14.92
Suppress your own peculiarities as far as possible when they are contrary to the customs of the land.

1725
02:17:14.92 --> 02:17:20.92
Number seven, when foreign customs are none of your business, then mind only your own business.

1726
02:17:20.92 --> 02:17:22.92
Number eight, be friendly.

1727
02:17:22.92 --> 02:17:26.92
After all, the only way to make other men like you is to like them.

1728
02:17:26.92 --> 02:17:29.92
Number nine, take people as they come.

1729
02:17:29.92 --> 02:17:37.92
Like them for what they are, not for the way they happen to measure up to your own standards, what you expected of them.

1730
02:17:37.92 --> 02:17:44.92
So, really good guidance, just in general, for humans.

1731
02:17:44.92 --> 02:17:47.92
Those are interesting now.

1732
02:17:47.92 --> 02:17:52.92
What do you say if it's like if their customs are a feminine or so?

1733
02:17:52.92 --> 02:17:57.92
So I remember what I was learning Spanish in high school.

1734
02:17:57.92 --> 02:18:01.92
They were talking about this difference between Spanish and Spain and Mexico and different.

1735
02:18:01.92 --> 02:18:02.92
It's a different.

1736
02:18:02.92 --> 02:18:05.92
Castilean Spanish versus what they speak in Spain.

1737
02:18:05.92 --> 02:18:10.92
In Mexico they speak, I don't know if they call it Mexican Spanish, but it's fast.

1738
02:18:10.92 --> 02:18:19.92
So I remember, you know, in part of the course, they're talking about different customs and stuff like that.

1739
02:18:19.92 --> 02:18:26.92
So I guess in Spain they say the S is with a list, like a T-ch, or the Z is just a little bit.

1740
02:18:26.92 --> 02:18:34.92
But there was just one custom that I can remember that they're like, oh yeah, it's not uncommon to see like men holding hands.

1741
02:18:34.92 --> 02:18:37.92
And they're like, you know how like, hey, you have your hand around.

1742
02:18:37.92 --> 02:18:45.92
Guys just holding hands, that's how, you know, and I remember thinking, that's interesting, you know, because that's something that's really far from custom here.

1743
02:18:45.92 --> 02:18:46.92
Yeah, yeah.

1744
02:18:46.92 --> 02:18:50.92
But we will have our hand, like our arm around, you know, when you're a kid, you got your arm for your boys.

1745
02:18:50.92 --> 02:18:53.92
Yeah, but you're not just walking around like that.

1746
02:18:53.92 --> 02:18:55.92
Yeah, sometimes I guess.

1747
02:18:55.92 --> 02:18:56.92
I don't know.

1748
02:18:56.92 --> 02:18:58.92
You're doing it, okay, you're a kid.

1749
02:18:58.92 --> 02:19:01.92
You're walking off the football field after a good play.

1750
02:19:01.92 --> 02:19:04.92
Sure, you might have your arm around, but you're not walking down the sidewalk.

1751
02:19:04.92 --> 02:19:07.92
You're going to move you with your arm around your body.

1752
02:19:07.92 --> 02:19:08.92
That's not happening.

1753
02:19:08.92 --> 02:19:09.92
Yes.

1754
02:19:09.92 --> 02:19:10.92
So you're right.

1755
02:19:10.92 --> 02:19:17.92
And that that custom of holding hands is really common throughout, like dudes holding hands, real common throughout the rest of the world.

1756
02:19:17.92 --> 02:19:19.92
Like lots of different places do that.

1757
02:19:19.92 --> 02:19:20.92
Yeah.

1758
02:19:20.92 --> 02:19:28.92
And it's definitely, we definitely get some funny situations where the, the seal that's, you know, super macho.

1759
02:19:28.92 --> 02:19:31.92
And he's, we're over working with some, in some foreign country.

1760
02:19:31.92 --> 02:19:34.92
And some guys, you know, they're talking to him. They start to like him.

1761
02:19:34.92 --> 02:19:35.92
Or whatever, they start getting along.

1762
02:19:35.92 --> 02:19:36.92
Yeah.

1763
02:19:36.92 --> 02:19:37.92
We're going to start holding hands.

1764
02:19:37.92 --> 02:19:39.92
I'm going to walk over to the galley.

1765
02:19:39.92 --> 02:19:40.92
Yes.

1766
02:19:40.92 --> 02:19:41.92
You see a TV, guys.

1767
02:19:41.92 --> 02:19:43.92
We like, not out of.

1768
02:19:43.92 --> 02:19:45.92
Somebody needs to breathe.

1769
02:19:45.92 --> 02:19:46.92
You are our customs.

1770
02:19:46.92 --> 02:19:46.92
We don't do that.

1771
02:19:46.92 --> 02:19:47.92
I don't know.

1772
02:19:47.92 --> 02:19:48.92
Well, according to the book,

1773
02:19:48.92 --> 02:19:49.92
That's what I'm saying.

1774
02:19:49.92 --> 02:19:51.60
They can't be like,

1775
02:19:51.92 --> 02:19:54.92
You've got to, you know, just go ahead and hold the fence with your whole boy.

1776
02:19:54.92 --> 02:19:55.92
Yeah.

1777
02:19:55.92 --> 02:19:56.92
But yeah.

1778
02:19:56.92 --> 02:20:00.92
That's the kind of thing that that is rough for men.

1779
02:20:00.92 --> 02:20:04.36
for a man and especially American dudes to get over.

1780
02:20:04.36 --> 02:20:06.56
We're just gonna walk around the whole dance.

1781
02:20:06.56 --> 02:20:09.48
Or like, you know, in Europe, they'll like kiss,

1782
02:20:09.48 --> 02:20:11.60
not necessarily on the lips necessarily, right?

1783
02:20:11.60 --> 02:20:13.000
But always on the cheek, right?

1784
02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:13.84
Yeah.

1785
02:20:13.84 --> 02:20:14.68
Right.

1786
02:20:14.68 --> 02:20:15.08
You tried to kiss me on the cheek,

1787
02:20:15.08 --> 02:20:17.64
that would make me weird for the day.

1788
02:20:17.64 --> 02:20:18.64
It can't be.

1789
02:20:18.64 --> 02:20:21.32
We're weird for the day for me, too.

1790
02:20:21.32 --> 02:20:22.84
If I saw me random, yeah.

1791
02:20:22.84 --> 02:20:26.28
No kissing is no factor in much of the world

1792
02:20:26.28 --> 02:20:28.16
for a guy to kiss another guy.

1793
02:20:28.16 --> 02:20:30.000
Like, hey, good to see you.

1794
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.04
Plant one on me.

1795
02:20:31.04 --> 02:20:33.64
Well, here in America, it's like, hey, good to see you.

1796
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:35.24
Keep out of my personal space.

1797
02:20:35.24 --> 02:20:36.08
Yeah.

1798
02:20:36.08 --> 02:20:38.44
But actually, you know what to be on this.

1799
02:20:38.44 --> 02:20:39.60
I don't care.

1800
02:20:39.60 --> 02:20:41.04
Like, people actually sell my friends.

1801
02:20:41.04 --> 02:20:43.24
They, you know, some, you know, like, they tell you

1802
02:20:43.24 --> 02:20:45.24
mafia kind of thing, like they'll build this.

1803
02:20:45.24 --> 02:20:46.24
You know, and they'll do that.

1804
02:20:46.24 --> 02:20:48.52
So my friends, they kind of, you know what?

1805
02:20:48.52 --> 02:20:49.52
You know what?

1806
02:20:49.52 --> 02:20:51.72
You know what thing broke down my personal space

1807
02:20:51.72 --> 02:20:52.72
more than anything else?

1808
02:20:52.72 --> 02:20:53.72
Yes, I do.

1809
02:20:53.72 --> 02:20:54.72
Yes.

1810
02:20:54.72 --> 02:20:58.56
The whole thing of like hugging another dude when you see him.

1811
02:20:58.56 --> 02:21:01.12
I think that stemmed from GJ2.

1812
02:21:01.12 --> 02:21:01.92
Oh, for real?

1813
02:21:01.92 --> 02:21:05.20
I don't remember ever doing that before GJ2.

1814
02:21:05.20 --> 02:21:06.000
Yeah.

1815
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.80
I have to think more, but it just because because you did

1816
02:21:08.80 --> 02:21:13.20
to it's so close anyways, that when you, you know,

1817
02:21:13.20 --> 02:21:14.80
you're just like, that's the way it is.

1818
02:21:14.80 --> 02:21:15.32
Yeah.

1819
02:21:15.32 --> 02:21:18.76
So GJ2 once again, spreading for the spreading

1820
02:21:18.76 --> 02:21:20.32
customs around the world.

1821
02:21:20.32 --> 02:21:20.68
Yeah.

1822
02:21:20.68 --> 02:21:22.12
Breaking down boundaries.

1823
02:21:22.12 --> 02:21:23.60
Breaking down boundaries.

1824
02:21:23.60 --> 02:21:25.56
They broke down boundaries for, for me.

1825
02:21:25.56 --> 02:21:28.32
It in Hawaii, there's a lot of kissing that goes on,

1826
02:21:28.32 --> 02:21:31.68
mostly between like between,

1827
02:21:31.68 --> 02:21:34.20
you know, like girls and guys, like even like if it's like

1828
02:21:34.20 --> 02:21:36.72
your friend's wife, you kiss him on the cheek, that's how.

1829
02:21:36.72 --> 02:21:39.44
Like it's, in fact, if you don't, it's kind of like,

1830
02:21:39.44 --> 02:21:42.16
I was kind of standoffish kind of thing, not a huge deal,

1831
02:21:42.16 --> 02:21:45.76
but it's like, it's that normal in Hawaii.

1832
02:21:45.76 --> 02:21:49.12
But guys and guys, you know, I don't,

1833
02:21:49.12 --> 02:21:51.000
I don't think that that's an issue.

1834
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.68
Like if someone kissed me on my cheek when they saw me

1835
02:21:52.68 --> 02:21:53.88
and it was a guy, it's like,

1836
02:21:53.88 --> 02:21:55.84
I love you, bro, whatever, like that wouldn't,

1837
02:21:55.84 --> 02:21:57.12
that wouldn't move me either way.

1838
02:21:57.12 --> 02:21:58.12
That'd be like, yeah, fine.

1839
02:21:58.12 --> 02:21:58.72
Yeah.

1840
02:21:58.72 --> 02:22:02.84
But I'm saying if you did, because you have like a specific

1841
02:22:02.84 --> 02:22:05.68
type of personality, you know, that'd be like,

1842
02:22:05.68 --> 02:22:08.64
that's a new thing for the Jocco, I guess.

1843
02:22:08.64 --> 02:22:10.40
That would be a new exploration.

1844
02:22:10.40 --> 02:22:11.88
I guess.

1845
02:22:11.88 --> 02:22:13.80
Right, there is a time where I think we're doing like

1846
02:22:13.80 --> 02:22:15.32
a Facebook live or something.

1847
02:22:15.32 --> 02:22:16.84
And we're talking about cauliflower here.

1848
02:22:16.84 --> 02:22:17.84
Uh-huh.

1849
02:22:17.84 --> 02:22:20.96
And I was like, oh, I said something about LA after your

1850
02:22:20.96 --> 02:22:22.000
years are like soft.

1851
02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.44
And then I went and you were right next to me.

1852
02:22:23.44 --> 02:22:27.36
And I like, like, flick your ear or something.

1853
02:22:27.36 --> 02:22:29.60
And when I watched the live later,

1854
02:22:29.60 --> 02:22:32.60
the look on your face was like, you were genuinely,

1855
02:22:32.60 --> 02:22:35.92
not in a big way, but genuinely slightly offended.

1856
02:22:35.92 --> 02:22:38.20
But yeah, you're like, you're like,

1857
02:22:38.20 --> 02:22:39.04
like, it's right here.

1858
02:22:39.04 --> 02:22:40.04
Like it's right, micro.

1859
02:22:40.04 --> 02:22:41.04
I was at there.

1860
02:22:41.04 --> 02:22:43.96
I was at Maja Jitsu Academy when I was in Virginia Beach.

1861
02:22:43.96 --> 02:22:46.40
And there was a buddy mine, another seal.

1862
02:22:46.40 --> 02:22:48.44
And I had gotten him into Jitsu.

1863
02:22:48.44 --> 02:22:53.28
And he was a small guy, like, 140, 145 scenario.

1864
02:22:53.28 --> 02:22:55.56
And you know, he was like a white belt.

1865
02:22:55.56 --> 02:22:57.84
I'd been training and whatnot.

1866
02:22:57.84 --> 02:23:00.84
And we were both.

1867
02:23:00.84 --> 02:23:06.08
So now we were training and one night, I showed up at the Academy.

1868
02:23:06.08 --> 02:23:08.08
And we both showed up at the same time, like a similar time.

1869
02:23:08.08 --> 02:23:10.80
And in this Academy, it was Gustavo Machado.

1870
02:23:10.80 --> 02:23:13.88
And Guga, as his nickname, great dude.

1871
02:23:13.88 --> 02:23:17.16
And so, and Guga's Academy at the time was pretty small.

1872
02:23:17.16 --> 02:23:19.20
And it had one bathroom in the bathroom

1873
02:23:19.20 --> 02:23:20.28
is where you would change.

1874
02:23:20.28 --> 02:23:22.56
So put your Gion or whatever.

1875
02:23:22.56 --> 02:23:26.88
So my buddy goes in there.

1876
02:23:26.88 --> 02:23:30.24
And he starts changing and me being just like a team guy.

1877
02:23:30.24 --> 02:23:30.96
I'm like, whatever.

1878
02:23:30.96 --> 02:23:32.12
I'm going into.

1879
02:23:32.12 --> 02:23:34.56
So, and he's a lot smaller than me.

1880
02:23:34.56 --> 02:23:36.60
And I'm a blue belt at this time.

1881
02:23:36.60 --> 02:23:41.000
So, you know, there's that level of, you know,

1882
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.88
like he knows that the situation unfolds,

1883
02:23:44.88 --> 02:23:45.88
I can submit him.

1884
02:23:45.88 --> 02:23:47.56
That's the way it is.

1885
02:23:47.56 --> 02:23:49.68
And so, I just bust into the bathroom.

1886
02:23:49.68 --> 02:23:50.92
And he's changing.

1887
02:23:50.92 --> 02:23:53.44
So he's, you know, I don't know if he was completely naked,

1888
02:23:53.44 --> 02:23:55.000
but he was pretty close.

1889
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.84
And I come in and just drop my rip off my shirt,

1890
02:23:57.84 --> 02:24:02.84
drop my shorts and I hear him go, oh, oh.

1891
02:24:02.84 --> 02:24:04.96
And then he goes, and then he goes,

1892
02:24:04.96 --> 02:24:07.28
think of a happy place.

1893
02:24:07.28 --> 02:24:12.28
We both started laughing, but yeah.

1894
02:24:13.56 --> 02:24:15.16
Don't care about any of that stuff.

1895
02:24:15.16 --> 02:24:17.28
So, there you go.

1896
02:24:17.28 --> 02:24:22.88
Try and try and accept other people's customs

1897
02:24:22.88 --> 02:24:27.80
and don't try and impose your customs on them,

1898
02:24:27.80 --> 02:24:32.20
or you're not doing good for the diplomacy of the country.

1899
02:24:32.20 --> 02:24:33.36
Yeah.

1900
02:24:33.36 --> 02:24:35.32
Yeah, like even when you go to like France,

1901
02:24:35.32 --> 02:24:37.92
not to keep the customs going too long,

1902
02:24:37.92 --> 02:24:40.88
but whether it be France or wherever, right?

1903
02:24:40.88 --> 02:24:41.72
Mm-hmm.

1904
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:43.84
Here's it.

1905
02:24:43.84 --> 02:24:44.68
It's a hard one.

1906
02:24:44.68 --> 02:24:45.80
So, let's see, you go to the beach,

1907
02:24:45.80 --> 02:24:48.000
they can go topless there at the beach, right?

1908
02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.76
What if you're with your wife or whatever in your life,

1909
02:24:49.76 --> 02:24:53.28
like, oh, we're in France, I wanna go topless, you know?

1910
02:24:54.64 --> 02:24:56.48
How do you feel about that?

1911
02:24:56.48 --> 02:24:57.76
Whatever, all good.

1912
02:24:59.08 --> 02:25:01.28
I don't think we're going to a topless beach,

1913
02:25:01.28 --> 02:25:02.12
actually.

1914
02:25:02.12 --> 02:25:03.68
Okay, what if she wanted to go though?

1915
02:25:03.68 --> 02:25:04.68
She doesn't.

1916
02:25:04.68 --> 02:25:05.76
All right, there you go.

1917
02:25:05.76 --> 02:25:06.88
Answer.

1918
02:25:06.88 --> 02:25:08.20
The way I would see it is.

1919
02:25:08.20 --> 02:25:09.80
Yeah, we're so conservative, right?

1920
02:25:09.80 --> 02:25:10.64
Isn't that crazy?

1921
02:25:10.64 --> 02:25:12.72
We're super conservative.

1922
02:25:12.72 --> 02:25:15.80
Yeah, actually, Puritans are legit.

1923
02:25:15.80 --> 02:25:17.72
Yeah, I like the Puritans.

1924
02:25:17.72 --> 02:25:18.56
That's the England.

1925
02:25:18.56 --> 02:25:20.36
There's a little thread of Puritans

1926
02:25:20.36 --> 02:25:22.52
and I'm up in New England, and I always like that.

1927
02:25:22.52 --> 02:25:23.52
Yeah, I can dig it.

1928
02:25:24.88 --> 02:25:27.96
At a topless beach, I would let totally let my life go.

1929
02:25:27.96 --> 02:25:29.04
Totally.

1930
02:25:29.04 --> 02:25:32.04
Except if there was anyone there that we knew.

1931
02:25:33.16 --> 02:25:34.000
Interesting.

1932
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.56
So, like if my brother's friends or if my friend,

1933
02:25:37.56 --> 02:25:39.20
unless it was her girlfriend, I wouldn't care,

1934
02:25:39.20 --> 02:25:41.64
but yeah, if it was any of our friends

1935
02:25:41.64 --> 02:25:45.000
that we knew, that were guys, that would bother me.

1936
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:45.84
I think.

1937
02:25:45.84 --> 02:25:48.24
Well, my wife would just be she be wearing a swimsuit.

1938
02:25:48.24 --> 02:25:51.64
This is no real big discussion, right?

1939
02:25:51.64 --> 02:25:53.12
Yeah, no, they did it.

1940
02:25:53.12 --> 02:25:55.56
Would you wear, you know, how they wear it like the more

1941
02:25:55.56 --> 02:25:58.68
what, like the trunks that are like spito type trunks?

1942
02:25:58.68 --> 02:26:02.04
That's how, and, you know, it's a spito, yeah.

1943
02:26:02.04 --> 02:26:03.36
Yeah, yeah, would that be all you,

1944
02:26:03.36 --> 02:26:04.68
or would you stick with them?

1945
02:26:04.68 --> 02:26:06.32
No, I wear a surf shorts.

1946
02:26:06.32 --> 02:26:09.92
All right, but you got a book that's in Brazil,

1947
02:26:09.92 --> 02:26:11.08
you know, that's called a song.

1948
02:26:11.08 --> 02:26:11.92
Yeah.

1949
02:26:11.92 --> 02:26:12.76
Oh, yeah.

1950
02:26:12.76 --> 02:26:15.28
And Dean Lister, this is the,

1951
02:26:17.40 --> 02:26:18.36
I'm good friends with Dean.

1952
02:26:18.36 --> 02:26:19.84
Sure.

1953
02:26:19.84 --> 02:26:22.32
He went through a phase of wearing a sung-out,

1954
02:26:22.32 --> 02:26:24.64
a lot to train in.

1955
02:26:24.64 --> 02:26:25.68
I don't like that at all.

1956
02:26:26.68 --> 02:26:29.000
Dude's basically wearing a spito and beating me up.

1957
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Yeah, I'm not fun.

1958
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.28
Yeah, and he go with no shirt.

1959
02:26:31.28 --> 02:26:32.12
Oh, for sure.

1960
02:26:32.12 --> 02:26:35.20
So, yeah, that's, yeah, we're supposed to wear that.

1961
02:26:35.20 --> 02:26:36.80
Coinit needs to do that stuff too long.

1962
02:26:36.80 --> 02:26:39.56
That's no, they used to be pretty common for it.

1963
02:26:39.56 --> 02:26:42.16
It's definitely faded right now, for sure.

1964
02:26:42.16 --> 02:26:46.80
The idea of just wearing the tidy whitey sung-out.

1965
02:26:46.80 --> 02:26:48.000
Yeah, we're grappling.

1966
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:48.84
Yeah, for sure.

1967
02:26:48.84 --> 02:26:49.68
Yeah, for sure.

1968
02:26:49.68 --> 02:26:50.52
Yeah, yeah, fully.

1969
02:26:50.52 --> 02:26:52.84
But on the beach though, you go to Blia Brazil.

1970
02:26:52.84 --> 02:26:54.000
Yeah, Brazil, that's normal.

1971
02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000
That's the custom.

1972
02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000
But not you.

1973
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.20
You're not going to adopt that custom.

1974
02:26:57.20 --> 02:26:58.20
I'm American dude.

1975
02:26:58.20 --> 02:27:00.32
I know, bro, but when you go to these foreign lands,

1976
02:27:00.32 --> 02:27:01.20
I'm American, you know,

1977
02:27:01.20 --> 02:27:02.04
who's the foreign affair?

1978
02:27:02.04 --> 02:27:03.64
It's trying to box me in just saying the book,

1979
02:27:03.64 --> 02:27:04.48
say I did it.

1980
02:27:04.48 --> 02:27:05.92
Say the book said, you know,

1981
02:27:05.92 --> 02:27:08.08
and you're just in the, you're going to disobey that.

1982
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:09.32
All right, bro, whatever you like,

1983
02:27:09.32 --> 02:27:09.84
you're going to do it.

1984
02:27:09.84 --> 02:27:11.60
Yeah, I'm going to stick to the tradition.

1985
02:27:11.60 --> 02:27:13.96
That's what we do over here.

1986
02:27:13.96 --> 02:27:14.96
Yes, sir.

1987
02:27:16.24 --> 02:27:17.08
You done?

1988
02:27:17.08 --> 02:27:17.92
Yes, sir.

1989
02:27:17.92 --> 02:27:19.92
Trying to frame me up.

1990
02:27:19.92 --> 02:27:21.56
Rumor.

1991
02:27:21.56 --> 02:27:23.48
Rumor is the most primitive way

1992
02:27:23.48 --> 02:27:26.36
of spreading stories by passing on from mouth to mouth.

1993
02:27:26.36 --> 02:27:28.32
It is just as inefficient inaccurate

1994
02:27:28.32 --> 02:27:29.68
and unaccountable as it is,

1995
02:27:29.68 --> 02:27:30.68
primitive.

1996
02:27:30.68 --> 02:27:34.52
Rumors are repeated by even by those who do not believe the tales.

1997
02:27:34.52 --> 02:27:36.76
That's an interesting statement and it's very true.

1998
02:27:36.76 --> 02:27:38.40
This is this, this is an interesting statement.

1999
02:27:38.40 --> 02:27:40.80
You look at it from the viewpoint of fake news right now

2000
02:27:40.80 --> 02:27:42.36
and Russian bots.

2001
02:27:43.48 --> 02:27:46.96
Rumors are repeated by even those who do not believe the tales.

2002
02:27:46.96 --> 02:27:48.84
There is a fascination about them.

2003
02:27:48.84 --> 02:27:51.44
The reason is that they cleverly designed,

2004
02:27:51.44 --> 02:27:54.000
is that cleverly designed rumors give expression

2005
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.68
to something deep in the hearts of the victims.

2006
02:27:57.68 --> 02:28:01.24
The fears, suspicions for bidden hopes or day dreams

2007
02:28:01.24 --> 02:28:04.16
which they hesitate to voice directly.

2008
02:28:04.16 --> 02:28:08.40
So if a commanding officer can keep track of the rumors

2009
02:28:08.40 --> 02:28:10.40
that are going around among his men,

2010
02:28:10.40 --> 02:28:12.96
he will learn a great deal about their current fears

2011
02:28:12.96 --> 02:28:15.40
and hopes, he will have a sort of barometer

2012
02:28:15.40 --> 02:28:18.76
that registers the rises and falls of their morale.

2013
02:28:18.76 --> 02:28:20.24
That's a good point.

2014
02:28:20.24 --> 02:28:21.68
People are freaked out.

2015
02:28:21.68 --> 02:28:22.68
We're going to get attacked.

2016
02:28:22.68 --> 02:28:25.04
That means everyone's afraid that they're going to get attacked

2017
02:28:25.04 --> 02:28:26.56
or we're not going to be snor,

2018
02:28:26.56 --> 02:28:27.64
we're not going home on time.

2019
02:28:27.64 --> 02:28:29.08
Okay, everyone's concerned about that.

2020
02:28:29.08 --> 02:28:31.64
So pay attention to those rumors.

2021
02:28:31.64 --> 02:28:36.64
Our rumor is not always a lie, not always a malicious story.

2022
02:28:38.56 --> 02:28:41.32
And there are uses of rumor in war.

2023
02:28:41.32 --> 02:28:44.32
You can use it for disruption, you can use it as a smoke screen,

2024
02:28:44.32 --> 02:28:46.92
you can use it for discrediting news sources.

2025
02:28:46.92 --> 02:28:50.16
This is a special technique, you can win, do it now and all the time now.

2026
02:28:51.28 --> 02:28:52.60
There's different kinds of rumors.

2027
02:28:52.60 --> 02:28:54.04
There's the pipe dream rumor.

2028
02:28:54.04 --> 02:28:55.88
I thought pipe dream was a modern turn.

2029
02:28:55.88 --> 02:28:57.52
There's the pipe dream rumor

2030
02:28:57.52 --> 02:29:00.52
which depends on wishful thinking.

2031
02:29:00.52 --> 02:29:03.52
There's pleasure in believing and repeating what you hope is true.

2032
02:29:04.64 --> 02:29:07.68
The boogie man rumor is the opposite of the pipe dream.

2033
02:29:07.68 --> 02:29:09.60
It expresses fear not a wish.

2034
02:29:11.24 --> 02:29:14.56
The wedge driving rumor, perhaps the most dangerous of all

2035
02:29:14.56 --> 02:29:16.72
is the rumor that attempts to create hostility

2036
02:29:16.72 --> 02:29:18.76
and distrust between allies

2037
02:29:18.76 --> 02:29:21.28
or between particular groups within a country.

2038
02:29:23.92 --> 02:29:25.88
So you have to watch out for that.

2039
02:29:27.32 --> 02:29:28.96
What makes rumor work?

2040
02:29:28.96 --> 02:29:31.24
And I think this is probably the most important part of this section.

2041
02:29:31.24 --> 02:29:34.04
Rumors thrive on fertile soil.

2042
02:29:34.04 --> 02:29:36.40
What soil is fertile?

2043
02:29:36.40 --> 02:29:39.76
Lack of information about important things, favor rumor.

2044
02:29:39.76 --> 02:29:42.44
Rumors encourage by discontent frustration,

2045
02:29:42.44 --> 02:29:44.40
boredom, and idleness.

2046
02:29:46.24 --> 02:29:48.60
Expectation fosters rumors.

2047
02:29:50.80 --> 02:29:55.80
Sensor ship, since it blocks important news favors rumor.

2048
02:29:55.80 --> 02:30:00.80
And from those that you can get to how to control rumor,

2049
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.32
one ensure good faith in official communications.

2050
02:30:05.32 --> 02:30:07.80
If the public loses confidence in the reliability

2051
02:30:07.80 --> 02:30:11.76
of the communications of the armed forces and of the press

2052
02:30:11.76 --> 02:30:14.64
and radio, then rumors begin to spread fast.

2053
02:30:15.76 --> 02:30:16.80
So you got to tell the truth.

2054
02:30:16.80 --> 02:30:19.36
Two developed faith in leaders.

2055
02:30:19.36 --> 02:30:22.36
People can stand, people can stand censorship

2056
02:30:22.36 --> 02:30:24.20
and lack of news when they feel they are sure

2057
02:30:24.20 --> 02:30:26.12
they are not being told falsehoods

2058
02:30:26.12 --> 02:30:28.28
and that what is being held back is being held back

2059
02:30:28.28 --> 02:30:29.24
for good reason.

2060
02:30:29.24 --> 02:30:31.24
That applies to all leaders from the president,

2061
02:30:31.24 --> 02:30:34.32
to the humble school teacher, from the general to the corporal.

2062
02:30:36.28 --> 02:30:39.16
Three present as many facts as possible.

2063
02:30:39.16 --> 02:30:41.84
Let the press and radio give as full

2064
02:30:41.84 --> 02:30:43.64
and circumstantial news as they can

2065
02:30:43.64 --> 02:30:45.44
without giving too much aid to the enemy.

2066
02:30:45.44 --> 02:30:46.88
Let the armed forces do the same,

2067
02:30:46.88 --> 02:30:49.08
men want facts when they can't get facts.

2068
02:30:49.08 --> 02:30:51.12
They take them at this is something that

2069
02:30:51.12 --> 02:30:54.64
all the time in national and front will go into a company

2070
02:30:54.64 --> 02:30:56.56
and they're having problems with the rumors.

2071
02:30:56.56 --> 02:30:57.92
And the reason that they're having problems with rumors

2072
02:30:57.92 --> 02:31:03.000
is because the leadership is not explaining what is happening.

2073
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.84
So for whatever reason they decide

2074
02:31:05.84 --> 02:31:09.04
they're going to close down a location.

2075
02:31:09.04 --> 02:31:11.40
Maybe it's because the rent was too high

2076
02:31:11.40 --> 02:31:12.56
and they're going to look for a different space.

2077
02:31:12.56 --> 02:31:14.84
Maybe it's because the market had dropped down.

2078
02:31:14.84 --> 02:31:18.08
There's so much that it was a losing money.

2079
02:31:18.08 --> 02:31:19.28
But what's the rumor?

2080
02:31:19.28 --> 02:31:20.72
If you don't tell people that,

2081
02:31:20.72 --> 02:31:22.40
the rumors were going out of business.

2082
02:31:22.40 --> 02:31:26.76
So they already shut down Pleasanton or whatever.

2083
02:31:26.76 --> 02:31:29.12
We're going down, find a new job.

2084
02:31:29.12 --> 02:31:33.32
So when you don't explain to people what's going on,

2085
02:31:33.32 --> 02:31:38.32
it's just had a guy, a leader who had to get rid of somebody.

2086
02:31:40.32 --> 02:31:44.84
And then it turned into a big email craziness

2087
02:31:44.84 --> 02:31:51.16
where the guy that got fired sent his closing email

2088
02:31:51.16 --> 02:31:51.84
to everyone else.

2089
02:31:51.84 --> 02:31:53.48
I'm going to miss you guys.

2090
02:31:53.48 --> 02:31:56.000
I'm sorry that did it work out.

2091
02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.36
I hope this doesn't bode bad for everyone else.

2092
02:31:59.36 --> 02:32:00.40
Like one of those, right?

2093
02:32:00.40 --> 02:32:01.64
Mass email.

2094
02:32:01.64 --> 02:32:04.28
So and the guy is going, what do you think I should do?

2095
02:32:04.28 --> 02:32:08.20
I mean, I shouldn't have to respond.

2096
02:32:08.20 --> 02:32:11.36
And I said, you don't have to respond.

2097
02:32:11.36 --> 02:32:12.84
But if you don't respond,

2098
02:32:12.84 --> 02:32:15.16
these people are going to create,

2099
02:32:15.16 --> 02:32:17.08
they're going to run with everything he said.

2100
02:32:17.08 --> 02:32:20.76
So craft an email and say, hey, everyone,

2101
02:32:20.76 --> 02:32:23.76
sorry to see Billy go.

2102
02:32:23.76 --> 02:32:26.92
Billy, we wish you luck or maybe you don't include

2103
02:32:26.92 --> 02:32:27.60
Billy on the email.

2104
02:32:27.60 --> 02:32:28.52
In fact, it probably wouldn't.

2105
02:32:28.52 --> 02:32:31.72
But sorry to see Billy go, here's what happened.

2106
02:32:31.72 --> 02:32:33.000
Here's what unfolded.

2107
02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.12
Here is our financial situation.

2108
02:32:35.12 --> 02:32:38.44
We were actually losing money in his division.

2109
02:32:38.44 --> 02:32:41.64
Not for one month, not for three months.

2110
02:32:41.64 --> 02:32:46.64
But for 14 straight months, I had asked him repeatedly

2111
02:32:48.04 --> 02:32:51.20
to conduct or to make these changes.

2112
02:32:51.20 --> 02:32:53.28
And he hadn't made any changes.

2113
02:32:53.28 --> 02:32:56.52
And although I like Billy as a person,

2114
02:32:56.52 --> 02:33:00.36
I couldn't sacrifice everyone at this company

2115
02:33:00.36 --> 02:33:01.80
for one person.

2116
02:33:01.80 --> 02:33:04.56
What we need is to be profitable.

2117
02:33:04.56 --> 02:33:06.36
And with Billy in charge of that division,

2118
02:33:06.36 --> 02:33:07.80
we're losing money.

2119
02:33:07.80 --> 02:33:10.96
And as the leader, I can't allow my loyalty

2120
02:33:10.96 --> 02:33:14.88
to one person to Trump, my loyalty to everyone here.

2121
02:33:14.88 --> 02:33:16.72
Therefore, I had to let him go.

2122
02:33:16.72 --> 02:33:20.36
Now we've gotten that rumor under control.

2123
02:33:20.36 --> 02:33:23.68
Next, keep men and women busy.

2124
02:33:23.68 --> 02:33:24.40
Was it what's funny?

2125
02:33:24.40 --> 02:33:26.80
Is that leader was telling me, look,

2126
02:33:27.80 --> 02:33:30.68
I never had to do this before.

2127
02:33:30.68 --> 02:33:32.48
Tell everyone in an email what's going on?

2128
02:33:32.48 --> 02:33:35.04
Well, you've never had an email, right?

2129
02:33:35.04 --> 02:33:37.44
Email is relatively new.

2130
02:33:37.44 --> 02:33:38.60
You know?

2131
02:33:38.60 --> 02:33:40.40
And so it's not like somebody who's sending out

2132
02:33:40.40 --> 02:33:44.72
or mass email thrown in darts and spears at everyone's

2133
02:33:44.72 --> 02:33:46.56
from their email.

2134
02:33:46.56 --> 02:33:48.72
For keep men and women busy,

2135
02:33:48.72 --> 02:33:50.96
prevent idleness and monotony.

2136
02:33:50.96 --> 02:33:53.60
Empty minds are easily filled with untruths

2137
02:33:53.60 --> 02:33:56.60
and worries, idle hands make busy tongues.

2138
02:33:56.60 --> 02:33:59.36
Fight rumor, mongering campaign against rumor,

2139
02:33:59.36 --> 02:34:01.12
expose it as enemy propaganda,

2140
02:34:01.12 --> 02:34:03.28
discredit specific rumors as inaccurate

2141
02:34:03.28 --> 02:34:06.60
and false caricature rumor monitors.

2142
02:34:06.60 --> 02:34:11.60
And this section is called psychological warfare,

2143
02:34:12.48 --> 02:34:13.80
interestingly enough.

2144
02:34:13.80 --> 02:34:17.68
Death can be inflicted upon the bodies of an enemy,

2145
02:34:17.68 --> 02:34:20.08
destruction upon property,

2146
02:34:20.08 --> 02:34:23.84
but defeat is a conquest of the mind.

2147
02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.04
So legit, in total war,

2148
02:34:29.04 --> 02:34:31.16
economic military and psychological action

2149
02:34:31.16 --> 02:34:34.88
are all used to bring about submission in the enemy.

2150
02:34:34.88 --> 02:34:37.48
Economic action deprives the enemy of vital materials,

2151
02:34:37.48 --> 02:34:39.76
military action destroys his armies by killing

2152
02:34:39.76 --> 02:34:41.92
capturing, scattering the soldier smashing,

2153
02:34:41.92 --> 02:34:45.24
or capturing the guns tanks, planes, trucks and supplies.

2154
02:34:45.24 --> 02:34:48.44
But it is successful, psychological action

2155
02:34:48.44 --> 02:34:52.40
that in the end deprives the enemy of his will to resist

2156
02:34:52.40 --> 02:34:54.72
and can spoil the individual soldier

2157
02:34:54.72 --> 02:34:57.56
as a fighting machine by removing the one thing

2158
02:34:57.56 --> 02:34:58.64
that makes him fight.

2159
02:34:59.60 --> 02:35:01.12
The hope of success.

2160
02:35:02.20 --> 02:35:04.48
The soldier without hope is like a tank

2161
02:35:04.48 --> 02:35:05.64
without gas.

2162
02:35:06.76 --> 02:35:09.28
When you come right down to it all warfare,

2163
02:35:09.28 --> 02:35:13.36
military and economic to is psychological warfare.

2164
02:35:13.36 --> 02:35:16.64
Since willingness to surrender is a state of mind,

2165
02:35:16.64 --> 02:35:19.48
all these different means are used to bring about

2166
02:35:19.48 --> 02:35:23.76
a change of mind to convert determination to resist

2167
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:26.68
into willingness to accept defeat.

2168
02:35:28.92 --> 02:35:31.32
The chief tool of psychological warfare,

2169
02:35:31.32 --> 02:35:36.08
the one that is most peculiar, particularly psychological,

2170
02:35:36.08 --> 02:35:37.12
is propaganda.

2171
02:35:38.52 --> 02:35:40.80
Since propaganda tries to change opinion,

2172
02:35:40.80 --> 02:35:43.24
the people who plan propaganda have to know

2173
02:35:44.40 --> 02:35:47.92
all about the opinions of those they are trying to change.

2174
02:35:47.92 --> 02:35:49.88
You can't be intelligent about changing anything

2175
02:35:49.88 --> 02:35:52.08
unless you know what it is you're trying to change.

2176
02:35:52.08 --> 02:35:53.000
A good point.

2177
02:35:54.56 --> 02:35:56.60
And then it talks about how you figure out

2178
02:35:56.60 --> 02:35:58.20
what people's opinions are.

2179
02:35:58.20 --> 02:36:00.40
You have to gather that information

2180
02:36:00.40 --> 02:36:02.16
and how to pull for that information.

2181
02:36:02.16 --> 02:36:04.60
Then it talks about a little bit about propaganda.

2182
02:36:04.60 --> 02:36:06.72
The truth is the best propaganda.

2183
02:36:07.92 --> 02:36:10.88
Propaganda does not have to be dishonest or lying.

2184
02:36:10.88 --> 02:36:13.000
Hitler said that a lie will be believed

2185
02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.68
if it is big enough.

2186
02:36:14.68 --> 02:36:16.56
And it may be at first,

2187
02:36:16.56 --> 02:36:18.48
but the big lies don't stand up.

2188
02:36:18.48 --> 02:36:22.56
Eventually the truth catches them and unmasks them.

2189
02:36:22.56 --> 02:36:25.68
The goal of propaganda is always a change

2190
02:36:25.68 --> 02:36:27.24
in the state of mind.

2191
02:36:27.24 --> 02:36:31.40
Good propaganda always starts from a fact.

2192
02:36:34.24 --> 02:36:37.68
There is a formula for victory in psychological warfare.

2193
02:36:37.68 --> 02:36:39.68
One, the enemy must be weary.

2194
02:36:39.68 --> 02:36:42.08
He must be second tired and discouraged.

2195
02:36:42.08 --> 02:36:44.48
Two, the second step in psychological warfare

2196
02:36:44.48 --> 02:36:46.84
is to turn disillusionment into despair

2197
02:36:46.84 --> 02:36:50.48
to convince the weary enemy that victory is impossible.

2198
02:36:51.48 --> 02:36:54.72
The third step is to promise something better.

2199
02:36:54.72 --> 02:36:58.24
Show him away out the cornered beast

2200
02:36:58.24 --> 02:37:01.20
to fight to the death unless he sees a way of escape.

2201
02:37:02.96 --> 02:37:05.40
Four, after the creation of despair,

2202
02:37:05.40 --> 02:37:07.44
after the promise of something better,

2203
02:37:07.44 --> 02:37:08.52
there is left.

2204
02:37:08.52 --> 02:37:10.44
There is left still one further step

2205
02:37:10.44 --> 02:37:12.04
for psychological warfare.

2206
02:37:12.04 --> 02:37:15.48
The enemy must be led to fix the blame

2207
02:37:15.48 --> 02:37:16.72
on his own leaders.

2208
02:37:17.84 --> 02:37:19.16
The soldier who surrenders

2209
02:37:19.16 --> 02:37:22.24
when he could have fought on must have some excuse

2210
02:37:22.24 --> 02:37:24.12
and he will find it.

2211
02:37:24.12 --> 02:37:26.72
If his discipline is broken down by his conviction

2212
02:37:26.72 --> 02:37:28.64
that his own leaders are responsible

2213
02:37:28.64 --> 02:37:30.40
for his unnecessary predicament.

2214
02:37:31.40 --> 02:37:34.20
That last step may come of itself

2215
02:37:34.20 --> 02:37:36.44
but propaganda can help it.

2216
02:37:36.44 --> 02:37:39.84
So those are some really important steps.

2217
02:37:39.84 --> 02:37:41.96
And if you think about them,

2218
02:37:43.76 --> 02:37:45.80
if you think about them from a leadership perspective,

2219
02:37:45.80 --> 02:37:47.08
they're very, very powerful.

2220
02:37:47.08 --> 02:37:49.04
If you think about them from a business perspective,

2221
02:37:49.04 --> 02:37:50.36
they are very, very powerful.

2222
02:37:51.56 --> 02:37:53.000
And when you know the offense,

2223
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.76
you also have to understand the defense

2224
02:37:55.76 --> 02:37:57.64
against psychological warfare.

2225
02:37:57.64 --> 02:37:59.20
Number one, don't trust the enemy.

2226
02:38:00.20 --> 02:38:02.60
Remember that broadcasts and leaflets

2227
02:38:02.60 --> 02:38:04.48
don't necessarily come from the sources

2228
02:38:04.48 --> 02:38:05.88
from which they claim to come from.

2229
02:38:05.88 --> 02:38:07.12
And by the way, it also applies

2230
02:38:07.12 --> 02:38:12.12
to emails, articles, tweets, social media posts,

2231
02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.56
Russian bots.

2232
02:38:16.96 --> 02:38:20.48
Be critical, even though a story starts off

2233
02:38:20.48 --> 02:38:21.88
with what you know to be true,

2234
02:38:21.88 --> 02:38:24.000
don't trust the interpretation that is tacked

2235
02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.40
onto the truth.

2236
02:38:25.40 --> 02:38:28.64
And so don't accept first interpretation.

2237
02:38:28.64 --> 02:38:31.16
You hear about the reason a battle is won or lost

2238
02:38:31.16 --> 02:38:34.16
or the reason there isn't any more coffee.

2239
02:38:34.16 --> 02:38:36.96
Wait, the first story is the best propaganda

2240
02:38:36.96 --> 02:38:39.40
because it has no other story to overcome

2241
02:38:39.40 --> 02:38:43.56
but it is not necessarily the best for you to believe.

2242
02:38:43.56 --> 02:38:47.60
But in general, don't trust the enemy.

2243
02:38:47.60 --> 02:38:50.60
Don't trust the enemy.

2244
02:38:51.60 --> 02:38:54.60
If he turns friendly, fear him or better

2245
02:38:54.60 --> 02:38:56.60
understand that he's up to no good.

2246
02:38:56.60 --> 02:38:58.20
If you are captured, tell him just your name,

2247
02:38:58.20 --> 02:38:59.80
rank and serial number, nothing else.

2248
02:38:59.80 --> 02:39:02.000
Just because he seems friendly and well-meaning

2249
02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.20
don't spill things you think are unimportant.

2250
02:39:06.20 --> 02:39:09.60
And it wraps up with us, trust only your own leaders.

2251
02:39:09.60 --> 02:39:10.60
They're for you.

2252
02:39:10.60 --> 02:39:17.60
You trust them and be wise.

2253
02:39:17.60 --> 02:39:21.60
That's a kind of an interesting way to finish up that book

2254
02:39:21.60 --> 02:39:25.60
is that statement, trust them but be wise.

2255
02:39:28.60 --> 02:39:30.60
Trust your leaders but at the same time be wise

2256
02:39:30.60 --> 02:39:32.60
and you've got to pay attention to that because

2257
02:39:32.60 --> 02:39:36.60
it's a little counter to trust.

2258
02:39:36.60 --> 02:39:39.60
It's a trust but be wise.

2259
02:39:39.60 --> 02:39:42.60
And I actually agree with that.

2260
02:39:43.60 --> 02:39:45.60
Question everything.

2261
02:39:46.60 --> 02:39:48.60
Be wise. Question everything.

2262
02:39:48.60 --> 02:39:51.60
Question your leaders. Don't follow people blindly.

2263
02:39:51.60 --> 02:39:52.60
You can put your trust in them.

2264
02:39:52.60 --> 02:39:55.60
Sure, but at the same time you have to be wise.

2265
02:39:55.60 --> 02:39:58.60
Be wise to question them.

2266
02:39:59.60 --> 02:40:02.60
Be wise to try and understand their decisions.

2267
02:40:02.60 --> 02:40:06.60
Be wise enough to disadvey them.

2268
02:40:06.60 --> 02:40:10.60
Should they choose to lead in a manner that is detrimental

2269
02:40:10.60 --> 02:40:17.60
to the mission, to the strategic objectives and to common sense?

2270
02:40:19.60 --> 02:40:22.60
And you know what? You've got to be wise.

2271
02:40:22.60 --> 02:40:24.60
Not just about your leaders but about everyone.

2272
02:40:24.60 --> 02:40:27.60
Seek to understand.

2273
02:40:28.60 --> 02:40:30.60
Seek to understand people.

2274
02:40:30.60 --> 02:40:39.60
Which you do by watching them and by observing them and by listening them.

2275
02:40:39.60 --> 02:40:45.60
And you know, one thing that we do people do is we spend a lot of time on

2276
02:40:45.60 --> 02:40:46.60
output.

2277
02:40:48.60 --> 02:40:51.60
We are sending all the time.

2278
02:40:51.60 --> 02:40:53.60
We are talking all the time.

2279
02:40:53.60 --> 02:40:57.60
We are putting information out all the time.

2280
02:40:57.60 --> 02:40:59.60
Learn to be on receive mode a little bit more.

2281
02:40:59.60 --> 02:41:01.60
Learn to listen a little bit more.

2282
02:41:01.60 --> 02:41:06.60
Learn to capture and absorb and utilize what other people reveal.

2283
02:41:08.60 --> 02:41:13.60
And when you do that you will go on a better understanding of them,

2284
02:41:13.60 --> 02:41:16.60
of yourself, of your team, of your enemy,

2285
02:41:18.60 --> 02:41:24.60
the nature of the battle itself and the nature of humans themselves.

2286
02:41:24.60 --> 02:41:31.60
So listen and learn and understand so that you can become wise

2287
02:41:31.60 --> 02:41:36.60
because if you become wise then you can win.

2288
02:41:38.60 --> 02:41:45.60
And that wraps up this incredible book psychology for the fighting man

2289
02:41:45.60 --> 02:41:49.60
what you should know about yourself and others.

2290
02:41:49.60 --> 02:41:52.60
All right.

2291
02:41:52.60 --> 02:41:54.60
So echo.

2292
02:41:54.60 --> 02:42:03.60
I know you've got some hopefully some information to tell us how to become a little bit

2293
02:42:03.60 --> 02:42:10.60
wiser in our movement down the path and our movement towards winning in all aspects of

2294
02:42:10.60 --> 02:42:15.60
life in this total war that we are fighting on a daily basis in all directions.

2295
02:42:15.60 --> 02:42:16.60
Yes sir.

2296
02:42:16.60 --> 02:42:17.60
What do you got?

2297
02:42:17.60 --> 02:42:18.60
Okay.

2298
02:42:18.60 --> 02:42:24.60
Due to is one of the many ways and now what kind of gear we're going to get when we do

2299
02:42:24.60 --> 02:42:26.60
due to or a genie.

2300
02:42:26.60 --> 02:42:27.60
Yes sir.

2301
02:42:27.60 --> 02:42:31.60
People have not been asking me that recently.

2302
02:42:31.60 --> 02:42:32.60
That's good.

2303
02:42:32.60 --> 02:42:33.60
That's a hopefully it's good.

2304
02:42:33.60 --> 02:42:36.60
Hopefully that signifies that they already know.

2305
02:42:36.60 --> 02:42:37.60
They know.

2306
02:42:37.60 --> 02:42:38.60
Yeah.

2307
02:42:38.60 --> 02:42:40.60
Hopefully it doesn't signify that people are slowing down.

2308
02:42:40.60 --> 02:42:44.60
Starting due to actually which you know what I know from different input

2309
02:42:44.60 --> 02:42:48.60
I'm receiving because I'm not receiving more right now.

2310
02:42:48.60 --> 02:42:53.60
That people are starting due to due to still just finished my first due to class got

2311
02:42:53.60 --> 02:42:54.60
rolled out.

2312
02:42:54.60 --> 02:42:58.60
Just finished my due to class I'm just finished my first strike on that white belt.

2313
02:42:58.60 --> 02:42:59.60
Oh yeah.

2314
02:42:59.60 --> 02:43:01.60
So people are getting on the path for sure.

2315
02:43:01.60 --> 02:43:04.60
And staying because I'm hearing about blue belts now.

2316
02:43:04.60 --> 02:43:08.60
And we've been that mode for like maybe a year almost.

2317
02:43:08.60 --> 02:43:10.60
We're because people are starting to get blue belts.

2318
02:43:10.60 --> 02:43:15.60
So we're talking about the blue belt team.

2319
02:43:15.60 --> 02:43:16.60
Right.

2320
02:43:16.60 --> 02:43:19.60
So we are the yeah we're seeing blue belts.

2321
02:43:19.60 --> 02:43:23.60
We're three years a little over three years deep in the podcast.

2322
02:43:23.60 --> 02:43:26.60
We should have our first.

2323
02:43:26.60 --> 02:43:29.60
Hopefully potential jocco podcast black belt within seven years is my prediction.

2324
02:43:29.60 --> 02:43:30.60
Yeah.

2325
02:43:30.60 --> 02:43:31.60
Yeah.

2326
02:43:31.60 --> 02:43:32.60
Right.

2327
02:43:32.60 --> 02:43:32.60
Yeah.

2328
02:43:32.60 --> 02:43:33.60
It would say average ten years.

2329
02:43:33.60 --> 02:43:34.60
Yeah.

2330
02:43:34.60 --> 02:43:35.60
How long did it take?

2331
02:43:35.60 --> 02:43:37.60
Maybe it took a few months before people started going.

2332
02:43:37.60 --> 02:43:40.60
Yeah.

2333
02:43:40.60 --> 02:43:41.60
Yeah.

2334
02:43:41.60 --> 02:43:41.60
Yeah.

2335
02:43:41.60 --> 02:43:44.60
But I was going at wrestling tournaments.

2336
02:43:44.60 --> 02:43:50.60
This is this was awesome going to wrestling tournaments and having kids that are

2337
02:43:50.60 --> 02:43:52.60
freshman in high school.

2338
02:43:52.60 --> 02:43:54.60
So they're 13 14 years old.

2339
02:43:54.60 --> 02:43:56.60
Guess what started in the grappling.

2340
02:43:56.60 --> 02:43:58.60
Little duck all the way.

2341
02:43:58.60 --> 02:43:59.60
No little but called way the warrior.

2342
02:43:59.60 --> 02:44:00.60
Yeah.

2343
02:44:00.60 --> 02:44:03.60
Way the warrior kid got them on the path.

2344
02:44:03.60 --> 02:44:05.60
And so they started that when they were 11 years old.

2345
02:44:05.60 --> 02:44:07.60
Two or three years ago and they read away the warrior kid.

2346
02:44:07.60 --> 02:44:09.60
I want to learn how to wrestle.

2347
02:44:09.60 --> 02:44:11.60
And then the kids come up to me.

2348
02:44:11.60 --> 02:44:12.60
Hey sir.

2349
02:44:12.60 --> 02:44:13.60
Are you all good to you?

2350
02:44:13.60 --> 02:44:15.60
My name is Freddie.

2351
02:44:15.60 --> 02:44:19.60
And I started wrestling because I got into jiu-jitsu.

2352
02:44:19.60 --> 02:44:21.60
So thank you.

2353
02:44:21.60 --> 02:44:25.60
So that's one of the best things that's happened to me in a long time.

2354
02:44:25.60 --> 02:44:26.60
Because why?

2355
02:44:26.60 --> 02:44:31.60
Because I know that that kid is going to have a legitimately better life because they know how to do

2356
02:44:31.60 --> 02:44:36.60
jiu-jitsu and wrestle.

2357
02:44:36.60 --> 02:44:39.60
They're life will be better.

2358
02:44:39.60 --> 02:44:46.60
So if you're doing jiu-jitsu, you get an orgy-gy, an orgy made in America and designed specifically

2359
02:44:46.60 --> 02:44:48.60
for a kiddo?

2360
02:44:48.60 --> 02:44:49.60
No.

2361
02:44:49.60 --> 02:44:50.60
For judo?

2362
02:44:50.60 --> 02:44:51.60
No.

2363
02:44:51.60 --> 02:44:52.60
For hopkido?

2364
02:44:52.60 --> 02:44:53.60
Nope.

2365
02:44:53.60 --> 02:44:55.60
Designed for one thing Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

2366
02:44:55.60 --> 02:44:56.60
Yeah.

2367
02:44:56.60 --> 02:44:57.60
That's what it's made for.

2368
02:44:57.60 --> 02:44:58.60
Yeah.

2369
02:44:58.60 --> 02:44:59.60
Not in like, generic way.

2370
02:44:59.60 --> 02:45:00.60
So impressive.

2371
02:45:00.60 --> 02:45:01.60
Yeah.

2372
02:45:01.60 --> 02:45:04.60
By black belt.

2373
02:45:04.60 --> 02:45:08.60
By jujitsu, black belt people made it.

2374
02:45:08.60 --> 02:45:09.60
Nestled jiu.

2375
02:45:09.60 --> 02:45:10.60
There you go.

2376
02:45:10.60 --> 02:45:12.60
So I just got some other clothes up there.

2377
02:45:12.60 --> 02:45:14.60
T-shirt, sweatshirts.

2378
02:45:14.60 --> 02:45:15.60
What we're working on boots.

2379
02:45:15.60 --> 02:45:17.60
I can't talk about that yet.

2380
02:45:17.60 --> 02:45:20.60
Because then people will be, you got to be for the next whatever.

2381
02:45:20.60 --> 02:45:23.60
As we try and get, we have the machinery in place.

2382
02:45:23.60 --> 02:45:25.60
We got models being built.

2383
02:45:25.60 --> 02:45:26.60
I have a pair.

2384
02:45:26.60 --> 02:45:27.60
I know you don't have a pair.

2385
02:45:27.60 --> 02:45:31.60
You know, quite, you know, on the inner, inner circle.

2386
02:45:31.60 --> 02:45:32.60
Yeah.

2387
02:45:32.60 --> 02:45:34.60
You look really despondent when I said that.

2388
02:45:34.60 --> 02:45:35.60
That's okay.

2389
02:45:35.60 --> 02:45:36.60
I broke it.

2390
02:45:36.60 --> 02:45:37.60
I broke it.

2391
02:45:37.60 --> 02:45:38.60
Anyway.

2392
02:45:38.60 --> 02:45:39.60
No kiss for you, later.

2393
02:45:39.60 --> 02:45:45.60
You get all these things at originmain.com.

2394
02:45:45.60 --> 02:45:48.60
Other stuff on there like supplements.

2395
02:45:48.60 --> 02:45:49.60
Most important supplements.

2396
02:45:49.60 --> 02:45:50.60
Okay.

2397
02:45:50.60 --> 02:45:52.60
I'd lift weights, whatever.

2398
02:45:52.60 --> 02:45:56.60
And I've always had probably like, maybe 15 years.

2399
02:45:56.60 --> 02:46:00.60
I would say, well, he said, like, this elbow, like, I wouldn't call it 10 to

2400
02:46:00.60 --> 02:46:01.60
9.

2401
02:46:01.60 --> 02:46:02.60
Although I have had 10 to 9.

2402
02:46:02.60 --> 02:46:03.60
It's my elbow.

2403
02:46:03.60 --> 02:46:04.60
It's just an elbow thing.

2404
02:46:04.60 --> 02:46:05.60
Yeah.

2405
02:46:05.60 --> 02:46:09.60
And so when I first got an joint warfare and the krill oil,

2406
02:46:09.60 --> 02:46:11.60
you'd go a winaway complete.

2407
02:46:11.60 --> 02:46:12.60
Right.

2408
02:46:12.60 --> 02:46:13.60
Winaway completely.

2409
02:46:13.60 --> 02:46:16.60
So recently, I got like heavy back into the living like man.

2410
02:46:16.60 --> 02:46:17.60
I can, you can go.

2411
02:46:17.60 --> 02:46:18.60
Right.

2412
02:46:18.60 --> 02:46:20.60
So it sort of starts to come back.

2413
02:46:20.60 --> 02:46:23.60
But now it's like at this phase where I'll feed like right now,

2414
02:46:23.60 --> 02:46:25.60
if I try to do like a close grip push-up or something like.

2415
02:46:25.60 --> 02:46:28.60
Like right now in this cold room, I'll feel it.

2416
02:46:28.60 --> 02:46:34.60
But the amount of sets that I have to do to warm it up are now reduced to one.

2417
02:46:34.60 --> 02:46:37.60
One, usually it was every single set of one.

2418
02:46:37.60 --> 02:46:39.60
It was like three four sets of warm up that my first set.

2419
02:46:39.60 --> 02:46:40.60
I could feel it, but I could over.

2420
02:46:40.60 --> 02:46:41.60
It was like that.

2421
02:46:41.60 --> 02:46:43.60
So it's like a, and I'm getting older.

2422
02:46:43.60 --> 02:46:44.60
I can younger.

2423
02:46:44.60 --> 02:46:47.60
I know it seems obvious, but given the way my elbow feels, you know,

2424
02:46:47.60 --> 02:46:48.60
not that obvious.

2425
02:46:48.60 --> 02:46:49.60
Yeah.

2426
02:46:49.60 --> 02:46:53.60
And the reviews on people for joint warfare are awesome.

2427
02:46:53.60 --> 02:46:54.60
Yeah.

2428
02:46:54.60 --> 02:46:58.60
People are, they get that where something's been bothered to them for so long.

2429
02:46:58.60 --> 02:47:03.60
And they get on the joint warfare for along the krill oil and you feel good.

2430
02:47:03.60 --> 02:47:08.60
It's, that's what makes it, in my opinion, the most important supplement.

2431
02:47:08.60 --> 02:47:09.60
Yeah.

2432
02:47:09.60 --> 02:47:10.60
Kind of stuff that allows you to work.

2433
02:47:10.60 --> 02:47:11.60
Yeah.

2434
02:47:11.60 --> 02:47:12.60
Exactly.

2435
02:47:12.60 --> 02:47:13.60
Yeah.

2436
02:47:13.60 --> 02:47:14.60
So true.

2437
02:47:14.60 --> 02:47:15.60
So yeah, joint warfare.

2438
02:47:15.60 --> 02:47:16.60
Boom, get that one.

2439
02:47:16.60 --> 02:47:17.60
Super krill oil.

2440
02:47:17.60 --> 02:47:19.60
Some added antioxidants in there.

2441
02:47:19.60 --> 02:47:21.60
And then discipline, which is,

2442
02:47:21.60 --> 02:47:23.60
it's a combination of two things.

2443
02:47:23.60 --> 02:47:31.60
It's a little physical energy boost and a mental cognitive increase in capacity to think.

2444
02:47:31.60 --> 02:47:32.60
So that's discipline.

2445
02:47:32.60 --> 02:47:38.60
The drink discipline go is that, but it's in the form of a pill.

2446
02:47:38.60 --> 02:47:40.60
So or wait, they call it a capsule.

2447
02:47:40.60 --> 02:47:41.60
Yeah.

2448
02:47:41.60 --> 02:47:42.60
It's a capsule.

2449
02:47:42.60 --> 02:47:46.60
I told Brian, a little.

2450
02:47:46.60 --> 02:47:47.60
Is it a, hey, man?

2451
02:47:47.60 --> 02:47:48.60
Discipline.

2452
02:47:48.60 --> 02:47:50.60
I'm addicted to the drink.

2453
02:47:50.60 --> 02:47:51.60
Mm-hmm.

2454
02:47:51.60 --> 02:47:52.60
Which I love it.

2455
02:47:52.60 --> 02:47:57.60
Thank you for, for helping me get this to the world.

2456
02:47:57.60 --> 02:48:04.60
However, if I'm going to go up on stage and talk for two hours, I can't pound two bottles of discipline.

2457
02:48:04.60 --> 02:48:05.60
Mm-hmm.

2458
02:48:05.60 --> 02:48:06.60
You know why?

2459
02:48:06.60 --> 02:48:08.60
It's a real simple, freezing.

2460
02:48:08.60 --> 02:48:09.60
It is what it is.

2461
02:48:09.60 --> 02:48:10.60
It's a biological reason.

2462
02:48:10.60 --> 02:48:11.60
Yeah.

2463
02:48:11.60 --> 02:48:14.60
Drink two liters of water and you're going to have to go to the bathroom.

2464
02:48:14.60 --> 02:48:15.60
Yes.

2465
02:48:15.60 --> 02:48:17.60
I don't want to have to stop.

2466
02:48:17.60 --> 02:48:21.60
Hey, hold on a minute.

2467
02:48:21.60 --> 02:48:23.60
Crowd of 700 people.

2468
02:48:23.60 --> 02:48:25.60
I'm just going to go hit the head real quick.

2469
02:48:25.60 --> 02:48:26.60
That's not how we do it.

2470
02:48:26.60 --> 02:48:28.60
So, took the discipline formula.

2471
02:48:28.60 --> 02:48:30.60
We made it into a capsule.

2472
02:48:30.60 --> 02:48:34.60
So now I can just pop three discipline when I'm going to need.

2473
02:48:34.60 --> 02:48:36.60
When I'm going to need that little edge, little edge.

2474
02:48:36.60 --> 02:48:39.60
You don't, as Jason Gardener put it to me.

2475
02:48:39.60 --> 02:48:42.60
The word searching gets reduced to zero.

2476
02:48:42.60 --> 02:48:44.60
Like it will word search anywhere in your head.

2477
02:48:44.60 --> 02:48:45.60
Yeah.

2478
02:48:45.60 --> 02:48:47.60
It's interesting stuff.

2479
02:48:47.60 --> 02:48:49.60
So is there okay, then there's that energy drink.

2480
02:48:49.60 --> 02:48:51.60
One version.

2481
02:48:51.60 --> 02:48:52.60
Right?

2482
02:48:52.60 --> 02:48:53.60
The energy drink is coming.

2483
02:48:53.60 --> 02:48:55.60
It's not out yet.

2484
02:48:55.60 --> 02:48:57.60
Well, the video with JP.

2485
02:48:57.60 --> 02:48:58.60
Yes.

2486
02:48:58.60 --> 02:48:59.60
Origin, boom.

2487
02:48:59.60 --> 02:49:00.60
Yeah.

2488
02:49:00.60 --> 02:49:02.60
But clearly the energy drink is made.

2489
02:49:02.60 --> 02:49:03.60
It is made.

2490
02:49:03.60 --> 02:49:05.60
But it's not in production yet.

2491
02:49:05.60 --> 02:49:07.60
And I'm going to go into why.

2492
02:49:07.60 --> 02:49:11.60
Well, the reason why it's not in production is because of the way we are producing it,

2493
02:49:11.60 --> 02:49:14.60
which is a way that no one else is doing.

2494
02:49:14.60 --> 02:49:17.60
Because of the bottom line is there's all kinds of what you call energy.

2495
02:49:17.60 --> 02:49:19.60
There's all kinds of energy drinks out there right now.

2496
02:49:19.60 --> 02:49:20.60
They're not good for you.

2497
02:49:20.60 --> 02:49:24.60
The closest thing you can get to an energy drink that's good for you is actually jockel

2498
02:49:24.60 --> 02:49:25.60
white tea.

2499
02:49:25.60 --> 02:49:27.60
That's the closest thing you can get because it tastes good.

2500
02:49:27.60 --> 02:49:29.60
It's got some caffeine from antioxidants.

2501
02:49:29.60 --> 02:49:33.60
We're taking that to the next level with the discipline.

2502
02:49:33.60 --> 02:49:36.60
Go ready to drink in a can.

2503
02:49:36.60 --> 02:49:37.60
Taste delicious.

2504
02:49:37.60 --> 02:49:40.60
And it's actually good for you.

2505
02:49:40.60 --> 02:49:41.60
This is the difference.

2506
02:49:41.60 --> 02:49:47.60
So that'll be out. I'm guessing we're probably not looking for another two months.

2507
02:49:47.60 --> 02:49:49.60
So no reason to get all excited yet.

2508
02:49:49.60 --> 02:49:51.60
I'll let you know when it's all out there.

2509
02:49:51.60 --> 02:49:56.60
In the meantime, the discipline powder is a good variant for now.

2510
02:49:56.60 --> 02:49:58.60
But yeah, the discipline going to can.

2511
02:49:58.60 --> 02:49:59.60
It's really.

2512
02:49:59.60 --> 02:50:01.60
It's nailed it.

2513
02:50:01.60 --> 02:50:04.60
Yeah, I got four samples there.

2514
02:50:04.60 --> 02:50:05.60
Yeah, they were gone.

2515
02:50:05.60 --> 02:50:06.60
I mean, I'm down.

2516
02:50:06.60 --> 02:50:10.60
I don't drink energy drinks, but if there's like one there that like I know is going to taste good.

2517
02:50:10.60 --> 02:50:13.60
I'm kind of, I'm kind of like those, you know.

2518
02:50:13.60 --> 02:50:15.60
So that one was like, oh, yeah, they were gone.

2519
02:50:15.60 --> 02:50:17.60
And that's the thing is it.

2520
02:50:17.60 --> 02:50:19.60
It tastes good, which is awesome.

2521
02:50:19.60 --> 02:50:20.60
It's actually good for you.

2522
02:50:20.60 --> 02:50:22.60
You know, there's no difference.

2523
02:50:22.60 --> 02:50:23.60
Just yeah.

2524
02:50:23.60 --> 02:50:25.60
So good to go.

2525
02:50:25.60 --> 02:50:26.60
Also got milk.

2526
02:50:26.60 --> 02:50:28.60
If you want to get on the milk train.

2527
02:50:28.60 --> 02:50:30.60
Yeah, for some additional protein.

2528
02:50:30.60 --> 02:50:32.60
Yeah, in addition to your rib eye steaks.

2529
02:50:32.60 --> 02:50:33.60
Yeah.

2530
02:50:33.60 --> 02:50:36.60
And here's the thing where you're talking to your Tomahawk rib eye steak.

2531
02:50:36.60 --> 02:50:37.60
Oh yeah.

2532
02:50:37.60 --> 02:50:39.60
You do think you need additional protein.

2533
02:50:39.60 --> 02:50:41.60
If you're working out, you do.

2534
02:50:41.60 --> 02:50:42.60
Straight up.

2535
02:50:42.60 --> 02:50:44.60
Otherwise you're body, what eats itself.

2536
02:50:44.60 --> 02:50:45.60
You want that to happen.

2537
02:50:45.60 --> 02:50:49.60
And I'll tell you what, even if you don't need additional protein, you know what you need dessert.

2538
02:50:49.60 --> 02:50:50.60
Yeah.

2539
02:50:50.60 --> 02:50:54.60
So luckily, milk is its own.

2540
02:50:54.60 --> 02:50:55.60
Why, what does milk?

2541
02:50:55.60 --> 02:50:56.60
What does this mean?

2542
02:50:56.60 --> 02:50:59.60
It means really tasty nectar.

2543
02:50:59.60 --> 02:51:01.60
That is going to make you stronger.

2544
02:51:01.60 --> 02:51:02.60
And you can have it for dessert.

2545
02:51:02.60 --> 02:51:04.60
And we don't get done having dessert.

2546
02:51:04.60 --> 02:51:07.60
You won't get done with it and think, oh, I still want some ice cream.

2547
02:51:07.60 --> 02:51:09.60
No, you're going to be like, I'm done with it.

2548
02:51:09.60 --> 02:51:10.60
And I'm done.

2549
02:51:10.60 --> 02:51:11.60
I'm still great.

2550
02:51:11.60 --> 02:51:12.60
We're good.

2551
02:51:12.60 --> 02:51:13.60
Okay.

2552
02:51:13.60 --> 02:51:16.60
So I made this, here's a new little dish.

2553
02:51:16.60 --> 02:51:17.60
Mm-hmm.

2554
02:51:17.60 --> 02:51:18.60
Yeah, my little.

2555
02:51:18.60 --> 02:51:19.60
I don't know.

2556
02:51:19.60 --> 02:51:20.60
Whatever.

2557
02:51:20.60 --> 02:51:21.60
Yeah.

2558
02:51:21.60 --> 02:51:26.60
So I go egg white omelet with like, you know, I'll take like,

2559
02:51:26.60 --> 02:51:28.60
You don't risk it, nomad it.

2560
02:51:28.60 --> 02:51:29.60
No, no.

2561
02:51:29.60 --> 02:51:33.60
So, you know, for example, my wife made pot roast.

2562
02:51:33.60 --> 02:51:34.60
Right.

2563
02:51:34.60 --> 02:51:35.60
So this is like pot roast.

2564
02:51:35.60 --> 02:51:36.60
There's little carrots in there.

2565
02:51:36.60 --> 02:51:37.60
You know, this potatoes in there.

2566
02:51:37.60 --> 02:51:38.60
Yes.

2567
02:51:38.60 --> 02:51:42.60
So I'll take some leftover pot roast and I'll make an egg white omelet with the pot roast.

2568
02:51:42.60 --> 02:51:43.60
Mm-hmm.

2569
02:51:43.60 --> 02:51:45.60
It seems kind of what I put, whatever the leftover is is very much part.

2570
02:51:45.60 --> 02:51:47.60
Oh, I'll make a omelet with it.

2571
02:51:47.60 --> 02:51:48.60
So I made it and it's good.

2572
02:51:48.60 --> 02:51:49.60
That's like good nutrients right there.

2573
02:51:49.60 --> 02:51:52.60
That's a solid like postwork out whatever.

2574
02:51:52.60 --> 02:51:53.60
Oh, yeah.

2575
02:51:53.60 --> 02:51:54.60
Taste good too.

2576
02:51:54.60 --> 02:51:56.60
And then, you know, no sugar.

2577
02:51:56.60 --> 02:51:58.60
No, it's like legit and taste really good.

2578
02:51:58.60 --> 02:51:59.60
So I pound that.

2579
02:51:59.60 --> 02:52:01.60
So it's not last night's in that before.

2580
02:52:01.60 --> 02:52:02.60
So I pound that.

2581
02:52:02.60 --> 02:52:05.60
I'm like, man, I'm just so not only did I get a good

2582
02:52:05.60 --> 02:52:08.60
healthy delicious little meal that I made.

2583
02:52:08.60 --> 02:52:10.60
I'm like, you know how you have to say,

2584
02:52:10.60 --> 02:52:12.60
you can't in the mood for some dessert.

2585
02:52:12.60 --> 02:52:13.60
No, no, no.

2586
02:52:13.60 --> 02:52:18.60
And in a way, in a week mind, in a matter of speaking, in a week,

2587
02:52:18.60 --> 02:52:21.60
you can be like, hey, I had such a healthy dinner.

2588
02:52:21.60 --> 02:52:22.60
Yeah.

2589
02:52:22.60 --> 02:52:26.60
I can kind of, you know, exercise some freedom on the dessert a little bit.

2590
02:52:26.60 --> 02:52:31.60
But I mixed up the milk, double win win.

2591
02:52:31.60 --> 02:52:32.60
Yeah.

2592
02:52:32.60 --> 02:52:35.60
And then you're, when you're kind of full like that,

2593
02:52:35.60 --> 02:52:39.60
sometimes you eat a giant steak, but you're still even though you're pretty full,

2594
02:52:39.60 --> 02:52:41.60
you want to have a little dessert.

2595
02:52:41.60 --> 02:52:42.60
Yeah.

2596
02:52:42.60 --> 02:52:43.60
A little one scoop hitter.

2597
02:52:43.60 --> 02:52:44.60
Yeah.

2598
02:52:44.60 --> 02:52:45.60
A little one scoop hitter.

2599
02:52:45.60 --> 02:52:46.60
That's too scoop.

2600
02:52:46.60 --> 02:52:47.60
Yeah.

2601
02:52:47.60 --> 02:52:50.60
And lately, I will say, I've been mixing less milk and more milk.

2602
02:52:50.60 --> 02:52:51.60
Oh, yeah.

2603
02:52:51.60 --> 02:52:53.60
It's thicker like a yogurt.

2604
02:52:53.60 --> 02:52:54.60
Oh, yeah.

2605
02:52:54.60 --> 02:52:55.60
It's so good.

2606
02:52:55.60 --> 02:52:56.60
It's like a little bit.

2607
02:52:56.60 --> 02:52:57.60
It's straight up milkshake.

2608
02:52:57.60 --> 02:53:01.60
Get that hitter as my brother, Theo Vaughan would say.

2609
02:53:01.60 --> 02:53:02.60
Yeah.

2610
02:53:02.60 --> 02:53:03.60
It's true.

2611
02:53:03.60 --> 02:53:04.60
Also warrior kid moke.

2612
02:53:04.60 --> 02:53:05.60
That's for the kids.

2613
02:53:05.60 --> 02:53:06.60
And think it's for kids.

2614
02:53:06.60 --> 02:53:07.60
Oh, that's probably.

2615
02:53:07.60 --> 02:53:09.60
It's a bit of a game to that too.

2616
02:53:09.60 --> 02:53:10.60
Yeah.

2617
02:53:10.60 --> 02:53:11.60
Yeah.

2618
02:53:11.60 --> 02:53:11.60
But that's a good one.

2619
02:53:11.60 --> 02:53:12.60
This was strawberry chocolate.

2620
02:53:12.60 --> 02:53:14.60
Is that that's the only two right now, right?

2621
02:53:14.60 --> 02:53:15.60
Yeah.

2622
02:53:15.60 --> 02:53:16.60
Yeah.

2623
02:53:16.60 --> 02:53:18.60
And then the strawberry that's going to go to the regular moke pretty soon.

2624
02:53:18.60 --> 02:53:19.60
Yeah.

2625
02:53:19.60 --> 02:53:20.60
It's coming.

2626
02:53:20.60 --> 02:53:21.60
We're working on it.

2627
02:53:21.60 --> 02:53:22.60
Very soon.

2628
02:53:22.60 --> 02:53:23.60
Also.

2629
02:53:23.60 --> 02:53:24.60
Joc was a store.

2630
02:53:24.60 --> 02:53:25.60
You know, stand the path.

2631
02:53:25.60 --> 02:53:26.60
Good.

2632
02:53:26.60 --> 02:53:27.60
Of course.

2633
02:53:27.60 --> 02:53:28.60
Stand the path.

2634
02:53:28.60 --> 02:53:30.60
But if you want to represent, while you're on the path,

2635
02:53:30.60 --> 02:53:32.60
you can see if you want this split equals freedom.

2636
02:53:32.60 --> 02:53:33.60
So good one.

2637
02:53:33.60 --> 02:53:35.60
Because two versions of that, by the way.

2638
02:53:35.60 --> 02:53:36.60
Just letting you go.

2639
02:53:36.60 --> 02:53:37.60
All done.

2640
02:53:37.60 --> 02:53:38.60
You know, yes.

2641
02:53:38.60 --> 02:53:40.60
And they're both in the game.

2642
02:53:40.60 --> 02:53:41.60
Food.

2643
02:53:41.60 --> 02:53:42.60
Good ways to represent.

2644
02:53:42.60 --> 02:53:43.60
Some hoodies on there.

2645
02:53:43.60 --> 02:53:45.60
Also more rash guards.

2646
02:53:45.60 --> 02:53:46.60
So you want to represent.

2647
02:53:46.60 --> 02:53:49.60
And people have been representing tournaments competitions.

2648
02:53:49.60 --> 02:53:50.60
Yeah.

2649
02:53:50.60 --> 02:53:51.60
You know, with get after it.

2650
02:53:51.60 --> 02:53:52.60
You know, on the rash guard.

2651
02:53:52.60 --> 02:53:53.60
These are all.

2652
02:53:53.60 --> 02:53:54.60
Yeah.

2653
02:53:54.60 --> 02:53:55.60
So really good.

2654
02:53:55.60 --> 02:53:57.60
When you see people straight representing.

2655
02:53:57.60 --> 02:53:58.60
Oh, yeah.

2656
02:53:58.60 --> 02:53:59.60
In the competition.

2657
02:53:59.60 --> 02:54:00.60
A lot of cool.

2658
02:54:00.60 --> 02:54:01.60
So again.

2659
02:54:01.60 --> 02:54:03.60
Hats.

2660
02:54:03.60 --> 02:54:05.60
Flex fit hats.

2661
02:54:05.60 --> 02:54:07.60
You know, I think we might discontinue the truck rats.

2662
02:54:07.60 --> 02:54:08.60
But.

2663
02:54:08.60 --> 02:54:09.60
Yeah.

2664
02:54:09.60 --> 02:54:09.60
Okay.

2665
02:54:09.60 --> 02:54:10.60
That's the idea.

2666
02:54:10.60 --> 02:54:11.60
Look at that.

2667
02:54:11.60 --> 02:54:12.60
Look at that.

2668
02:54:12.60 --> 02:54:13.60
All right.

2669
02:54:13.60 --> 02:54:14.60
We have.

2670
02:54:14.60 --> 02:54:15.60
We have.

2671
02:54:15.60 --> 02:54:17.60
We have.

2672
02:54:17.60 --> 02:54:18.60
We have both.

2673
02:54:18.60 --> 02:54:19.60
Truckers had.

2674
02:54:19.60 --> 02:54:20.60
And.

2675
02:54:20.60 --> 02:54:21.60
Flex it had.

2676
02:54:21.60 --> 02:54:22.60
Also.

2677
02:54:22.60 --> 02:54:23.60
Hoodies.

2678
02:54:23.60 --> 02:54:24.60
Oh, it already said.

2679
02:54:24.60 --> 02:54:25.60
Anyway, go on there.

2680
02:54:25.60 --> 02:54:26.60
Joc will store.com.

2681
02:54:26.60 --> 02:54:27.60
If you like something, get something.

2682
02:54:27.60 --> 02:54:28.60
Represent.

2683
02:54:28.60 --> 02:54:30.60
I'm a part of support.

2684
02:54:30.60 --> 02:54:31.60
It's true.

2685
02:54:31.60 --> 02:54:32.60
Also yourself.

2686
02:54:32.60 --> 02:54:33.60
Joc will wait.

2687
02:54:33.60 --> 02:54:34.60
T.

2688
02:54:34.60 --> 02:54:35.60
Okay.

2689
02:54:35.60 --> 02:54:36.60
Any can.

2690
02:54:36.60 --> 02:54:37.60
Yes.

2691
02:54:37.60 --> 02:54:38.60
Okay.

2692
02:54:38.60 --> 02:54:39.60
A little bit of caffeine in there.

2693
02:54:39.60 --> 02:54:40.60
Antioxidants.

2694
02:54:40.60 --> 02:54:42.60
Deadlift 8000 pounds.

2695
02:54:42.60 --> 02:54:43.60
That's good.

2696
02:54:43.60 --> 02:54:44.60
It's good.

2697
02:54:44.60 --> 02:54:46.60
Like my wife deadlifts 8000 pounds.

2698
02:54:46.60 --> 02:54:47.60
You know.

2699
02:54:47.60 --> 02:54:51.60
More from myel taste compared to the energy drink.

2700
02:54:51.60 --> 02:54:52.60
No, I know.

2701
02:54:52.60 --> 02:54:54.60
You mean energy drink in general?

2702
02:54:54.60 --> 02:54:55.60
No.

2703
02:54:55.60 --> 02:54:56.60
Your.

2704
02:54:56.60 --> 02:54:58.60
I just wouldn't go.

2705
02:54:58.60 --> 02:54:59.60
Yeah.

2706
02:54:59.60 --> 02:55:00.60
She would not call that an energy drink.

2707
02:55:00.60 --> 02:55:01.60
I wouldn't.

2708
02:55:01.60 --> 02:55:02.60
Yeah.

2709
02:55:02.60 --> 02:55:04.60
I would call it something else.

2710
02:55:04.60 --> 02:55:06.60
I would call it discipline.

2711
02:55:06.60 --> 02:55:07.60
Go.

2712
02:55:07.60 --> 02:55:08.60
Yeah.

2713
02:55:08.60 --> 02:55:08.60
I don't know.

2714
02:55:08.60 --> 02:55:09.60
I think.

2715
02:55:09.60 --> 02:55:09.60
Yeah.

2716
02:55:09.60 --> 02:55:10.60
Well, the jury's still out of now.

2717
02:55:10.60 --> 02:55:12.60
Because it's kind of an energy drink.

2718
02:55:12.60 --> 02:55:13.60
The problem is energy.

2719
02:55:13.60 --> 02:55:14.60
You don't want to.

2720
02:55:14.60 --> 02:55:15.60
Good for you.

2721
02:55:15.60 --> 02:55:16.60
Yeah.

2722
02:55:16.60 --> 02:55:17.60
Yeah.

2723
02:55:17.60 --> 02:55:18.60
Energy.

2724
02:55:18.60 --> 02:55:19.60
Yeah.

2725
02:55:19.60 --> 02:55:20.60
Well, think about that one.

2726
02:55:20.60 --> 02:55:21.60
The last.

2727
02:55:21.60 --> 02:55:22.60
Joc will wait.

2728
02:55:22.60 --> 02:55:23.60
Not an energy drink.

2729
02:55:23.60 --> 02:55:24.60
It's actual tea.

2730
02:55:24.60 --> 02:55:25.60
Sort of a certified organic.

2731
02:55:25.60 --> 02:55:26.60
Yeah.

2732
02:55:26.60 --> 02:55:27.60
U.S.D.

2733
02:55:27.60 --> 02:55:28.60
A.

2734
02:55:28.60 --> 02:55:31.60
You know, certified organic.

2735
02:55:31.60 --> 02:55:33.60
So yeah, you can get that one in a can.

2736
02:55:33.60 --> 02:55:35.60
Or what do you call it?

2737
02:55:35.60 --> 02:55:36.60
Luce?

2738
02:55:36.60 --> 02:55:37.60
No, that's not loose leaf.

2739
02:55:37.60 --> 02:55:38.60
Dry.

2740
02:55:38.60 --> 02:55:39.60
Just dry.

2741
02:55:39.60 --> 02:55:40.60
In the bags or whatever.

2742
02:55:40.60 --> 02:55:41.60
Yeah.

2743
02:55:41.60 --> 02:55:42.60
That's a good one.

2744
02:55:42.60 --> 02:55:43.60
You also subscribe to the podcast.

2745
02:55:43.60 --> 02:55:49.60
If you don't subscribe to the podcast, then echo is going to keep telling you if I don't tell you as quickly as possible to subscribe to the podcast.

2746
02:55:49.60 --> 02:55:50.60
So do that.

2747
02:55:50.60 --> 02:55:52.60
And don't forget about the warrior kid podcast.

2748
02:55:52.60 --> 02:55:59.60
Because your kids need to be shown the path.

2749
02:55:59.60 --> 02:56:03.60
And I hate to say this.

2750
02:56:03.60 --> 02:56:04.60
Not by you.

2751
02:56:04.60 --> 02:56:05.60
No, well, no.

2752
02:56:05.60 --> 02:56:06.60
In addition to you telling him.

2753
02:56:06.60 --> 02:56:08.60
In addition to you trying to convince him.

2754
02:56:08.60 --> 02:56:11.60
Because if you remember when you were a kid, you didn't want to listen to your dad.

2755
02:56:11.60 --> 02:56:13.60
You didn't want to listen to your mom.

2756
02:56:13.60 --> 02:56:16.60
You kind of always thought, well, you may be just, I might look.

2757
02:56:16.60 --> 02:56:17.60
I might only be 11 years old.

2758
02:56:17.60 --> 02:56:20.60
But I think I know a little bit better than my dad.

2759
02:56:20.60 --> 02:56:21.60
Right?

2760
02:56:21.60 --> 02:56:23.60
But very least, he don't understand.

2761
02:56:23.60 --> 02:56:26.60
So Uncle Jake can talk to your kid.

2762
02:56:26.60 --> 02:56:27.60
Get him on the path.

2763
02:56:27.60 --> 02:56:28.60
Let him know what's up.

2764
02:56:28.60 --> 02:56:35.60
Also get the warrior kid soap at the Irish Oaks Branch dot com young Aiden.

2765
02:56:35.60 --> 02:56:37.60
Young Aiden making soap.

2766
02:56:37.60 --> 02:56:38.60
Having his own business.

2767
02:56:38.60 --> 02:56:40.60
Buy in the material.

2768
02:56:40.60 --> 02:56:41.60
Growing the material.

2769
02:56:41.60 --> 02:56:44.60
Get some of that so that you can stay clean.

2770
02:56:44.60 --> 02:56:46.60
You got YouTube.

2771
02:56:46.60 --> 02:56:50.60
Subscribe to the YouTube channel so that you can see echoes of legit videos.

2772
02:56:50.60 --> 02:56:53.60
Technically, you don't have to subscribe.

2773
02:56:53.60 --> 02:56:54.60
Well, just check it out then.

2774
02:56:54.60 --> 02:56:57.60
But yeah, if you want subscribe, just a good one.

2775
02:56:57.60 --> 02:56:59.60
Subscribe, like and comment.

2776
02:56:59.60 --> 02:57:04.60
Anyway, I say that's like, you should for those that don't know.

2777
02:57:04.60 --> 02:57:05.60
We do have YouTube channel.

2778
02:57:05.60 --> 02:57:07.60
If you're interested in the video version.

2779
02:57:07.60 --> 02:57:09.60
If you want to see echo, Charles looks like.

2780
02:57:09.60 --> 02:57:14.60
If you want to comment that echo looks jacked or is jacked or is he hooked?

2781
02:57:14.60 --> 02:57:15.60
Sure.

2782
02:57:15.60 --> 02:57:16.60
Then you can do that there.

2783
02:57:16.60 --> 02:57:18.60
Don't forget about psychological warfare.

2784
02:57:18.60 --> 02:57:24.60
And I'll help you get through moments of weakness by hearing pragmatic information about why

2785
02:57:24.60 --> 02:57:26.60
you should stay on the path.

2786
02:57:26.60 --> 02:57:27.60
That is it.

2787
02:57:27.60 --> 02:57:29.60
I tuned to Google Play and be through platforms.

2788
02:57:29.60 --> 02:57:30.60

02:57:30.60 --> 02:57:33.60
Also, your home gym when you're expanding because we're always expanding.

2790

2798
02:57:45.60 --> 02:57:47.60
So yeah, when you get into kettlebells because you got to do

2799
02:57:47.60 --> 02:57:48.60
kettlebells.

2800
02:57:48.60 --> 02:57:49.60
kettlebells are good.

2801
02:57:49.60 --> 02:57:50.60
Yes.

2802
02:57:50.60 --> 02:57:52.60
So you want some info on there.

2803
02:57:52.60 --> 02:57:53.60
Boom.

2804
02:57:53.60 --> 02:57:55.60
That's where you can get a lot of good stuff on there.

2805
02:57:55.60 --> 02:57:57.60
On it dot com slash jockel.

2806
02:57:57.60 --> 02:57:59.60
I wrote a bunch of books.

2807
02:57:59.60 --> 02:58:07.60
If you want to get the books, go to jockelpondcast.com and then click on the various books.

2808
02:58:07.60 --> 02:58:10.60
Mikey in the Dragon is a book that I wrote.

2809
02:58:10.60 --> 02:58:14.60
It's for little kids, but everyone gets something out of it.

2810
02:58:14.60 --> 02:58:19.60
And it's a cool story that rhymes.

2811
02:58:19.60 --> 02:58:22.60
And it's delivered very eloquently.

2812
02:58:22.60 --> 02:58:30.60
If I don't know if eloquent the word eloquent is even compatible with you as a whole concept or whatever,

2813
02:58:30.60 --> 02:58:33.60
but I will I'll use it very eloquent.

2814
02:58:33.60 --> 02:58:34.60
Check.

2815
02:58:34.60 --> 02:58:36.60
So Mikey in the Dragons for kids.

2816
02:58:36.60 --> 02:58:41.60
Also for kids way the warrior kid and way the warrior kid too, which is called Mark's Mission.

2817
02:58:41.60 --> 02:58:48.60
And also way the warrior kid free, which is called where there's a will.

2818
02:58:48.60 --> 02:58:51.60
And that book is coming out in the spring.

2819
02:58:51.60 --> 02:58:56.60
Get your kids these books because they will point them in the right direction on so many things.

2820
02:58:56.60 --> 02:59:00.60
I wish I had these books when I was a kid so badly.

2821
02:59:00.60 --> 02:59:06.60
And I hope that the kids you know read these books and get themselves on the path.

2822
02:59:06.60 --> 02:59:10.60
And if an adult you know needs to get on the path, get them the discipline and

2823
02:59:10.60 --> 02:59:14.60
feel manual, which tells people how to get after it.

2824
02:59:14.60 --> 02:59:16.60
Everybody needs to know how to get after it.

2825
02:59:16.60 --> 02:59:19.60
In my opinion, it's a good little,

2826
02:59:19.60 --> 02:59:21.60
daily read.

2827
02:59:21.60 --> 02:59:23.60
It's not a normal book.

2828
02:59:23.60 --> 02:59:24.60
It's different.

2829
02:59:24.60 --> 02:59:26.60
Yes, very different.

2830
02:59:26.60 --> 02:59:27.60
So check that one out.

2831
02:59:27.60 --> 02:59:30.60
And then of course, there is extreme ownership.

2832
02:59:30.60 --> 02:59:32.60
The first book that I wrote with my brother,

2833
02:59:32.60 --> 02:59:41.60
Dave Babin, and also we just released last year dichotomy of leadership.

2834
02:59:41.60 --> 02:59:51.60
And I'm starting to think, there's people starting to comment that dichotomy of leadership is now starting to emerge from the shadow of his older brother.

2835
02:59:51.60 --> 02:59:56.60
And we're starting to think that dichotomy of leadership is going to be a little bit more yoke,

2836
02:59:56.60 --> 03:00:04.60
but a bit more jacked and made you serve the older brother, man, to be in the one that people really dial into.

2837
03:00:04.60 --> 03:00:06.60
So check them out.

2838
03:00:06.60 --> 03:00:12.60
Also speaking of books, if you want this book psychology for the fighting man,

2839

that's my recommended reading list.

2845
03:00:33.60 --> 03:00:34.60
Yes.

2846
03:00:34.60 --> 03:00:35.60
That's it.

2847
03:00:35.60 --> 03:00:37.60
It's jocopotcast.com.

2848
03:00:37.60 --> 03:00:40.60

And then you can get them.

2850
03:00:42.60 --> 03:00:43.60
So that's that.

2851
03:00:43.60 --> 03:00:45.60
That's a bunch of books that I've written.

2852
03:00:45.60 --> 03:00:48.60
Other books that you can be educated by, books that have educated me.

2853
03:00:48.60 --> 03:00:52.60
Excellent front leadership consultancy. We saw problems through leadership.

2854
03:00:52.60 --> 03:00:53.60
That's what we do.

2855
03:00:53.60 --> 03:00:55.60
Me, Lave Babin, J.P.

2856
03:00:55.60 --> 03:01:00.60
And L. Dave Burke, Flynn, Conqueror, Mike Surrely, Mike Bima, and we are at

2857
03:01:00.60 --> 03:01:04.60
echelonfront.com.

2858
03:01:04.60 --> 03:01:10.60
Also we have the mustard coming up 2019, May 23, 24 Chicago, September

2859
03:01:10.60 --> 03:01:14.60
and 1920 in Denver, December 4th and 5th in Sydney.

2860
03:01:14.60 --> 03:01:21.60
Go to extremeownership.com to register every event that we have done has

2861
03:01:21.60 --> 03:01:22.60
sold out.

2862
03:01:22.60 --> 03:01:24.60
These are absolutely going to sell out to.

2863
03:01:24.60 --> 03:01:29.60
And I thought, and I just talked to our Obsterector Jamie.

2864
03:01:29.60 --> 03:01:32.60
And she's like, yeah, we're at home sales.

2865
03:01:32.60 --> 03:01:35.60
And I was like, cool, it's glad we got so many more seats.

2866
03:01:35.60 --> 03:01:36.60
And she's like, what?

2867
03:01:36.60 --> 03:01:39.60
And I go, well, don't we have, don't we have, you know,

2868
03:01:39.60 --> 03:01:41.60
1200 seats or something?

2869
03:01:41.60 --> 03:01:43.60
She's like, no, the biggest we could get.

2870
03:01:43.60 --> 03:01:46.60
It's like, it's still, it's basically the same size as San Francisco.

2871
03:01:46.60 --> 03:01:48.60
750 here, something like that.

2872
03:01:48.60 --> 03:01:50.60
So we're just going to sell out very quickly.

2873
03:01:50.60 --> 03:01:53.60
So if you want to come, please just go and get on it.

2874
03:01:53.60 --> 03:01:58.60
EF online, online interactive training, leadership training.

2875
03:01:58.60 --> 03:02:08.60
We did this because echelonfront is not big enough and cannot grow quickly

2876
03:02:08.60 --> 03:02:11.60
enough to train everyone that requests training.

2877
03:02:11.60 --> 03:02:19.60
So what we did to scale what we do is put it what we do into an online platform,

2878
03:02:19.60 --> 03:02:22.60
interactive, very engaging.

2879
03:02:22.60 --> 03:02:25.60
It's what we do with companies.

2880
03:02:25.60 --> 03:02:28.60
And now we can do it through the computer screen.

2881
03:02:28.60 --> 03:02:34.60
So EF online, go and check that out.

2882
03:02:34.60 --> 03:02:40.60
And finally, EF overwatches where we take proven leaders from the

2883
03:02:40.60 --> 03:02:44.60
battlefield, from special operations and combat aviation.

2884
03:02:44.60 --> 03:02:51.60
And we embed them into companies where they can then help that company lead.

2885
03:02:51.60 --> 03:02:58.60
And when that's at EF overwatch.com, if you're one of those veterans looking for a follow-on

2886
03:02:58.60 --> 03:03:03.60
career or you're one of those companies that needs people that understand the

2887
03:03:03.60 --> 03:03:09.60
mindset that we talk about in the books and on this podcast, go to EF overwatch.com.

2888
03:03:09.60 --> 03:03:15.60
And thank you for listening.

2889
03:03:15.60 --> 03:03:21.60
And if you haven't had enough of us in three hours straight and you want to communicate with us

2890
03:03:21.60 --> 03:03:23.60
some more, that's fine.

2891
03:03:23.60 --> 03:03:30.60
We are available on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram.

2892
03:03:30.60 --> 03:03:32.60
And on FAC.

2893
03:03:32.60 --> 03:03:36.60
Echoes at Echo Charles and I am at Jocco-Willink.

2894
03:03:36.60 --> 03:03:39.60
And we are also interested in the first three hours.

2895
03:03:39.60 --> 03:03:44.60
Thanks to all our military personnel for standing watch around the world.

2896
03:03:44.60 --> 03:03:46.60
You protect our freedom.

2897
03:03:46.60 --> 03:03:47.60
And we are indebted to you.

2898
03:03:47.60 --> 03:03:51.60
We are also indebted to our police and law enforcement firefighters,

2899
03:03:51.60 --> 03:03:53.60
paramedics and EMTs, correctional officers, border patrol.

2900
03:03:53.60 --> 03:03:56.60
All first responders you keep us safe.

2901
03:03:56.60 --> 03:03:59.60
And we thank you for your service and sacrifice as well.

2902
03:03:59.60 --> 03:04:02.60
And to everyone out there listening.

2903
03:04:02.60 --> 03:04:10.60
Lessons. This book gives about the way we think about the way we act about the way we follow

2904
03:04:10.60 --> 03:04:16.60
and about the way we lead and remember that a good leader doesn't handle his man,

2905
03:04:16.60 --> 03:04:22.60
a good leader handles himself.

2906
03:04:22.60 --> 03:04:27.60
That's some of the best advice for leadership in life I've heard in a long time.

2907
03:04:27.60 --> 03:04:29.60
So follow what handle yourself.

2908
03:04:29.60 --> 03:04:32.60
Keep yourself in check. Keep yourself on the path.

2909
03:04:32.60 --> 03:04:37.60
Lead yourself so that you become a person that others will follow.

2910
03:04:37.60 --> 03:04:40.60
And they will follow you on the path.

2911
03:04:40.60 --> 03:04:51.60
The path of discipline, the path of righteousness and the path that leads to peace and the freedom.

2912
03:04:51.60 --> 03:04:56.60
So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

2913
03:04:56.60 --> 03:04:59.60
Out.
