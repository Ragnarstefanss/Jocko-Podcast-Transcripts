and it's weird because it makes you kind of go like Deep in your own head almost when you're like even that one when you're describing you know People you know me however be described in the news just like it's like You didn't do this like the opposite of the the opposite of that is like some grandiose thing where it's like You know one after another the people piled in like this and like that Um and it can kind of help a lot of us make sense out of certain elements of life, you know Whether be the specific questions that people ask or the first part that we talk about like you know Is our is our our children soft now, you know, it's society becoming soft or like you know So coming to the to the trick of advertising That can stuff like that's real stuff that we're dealing with like daily, you know that kind of pushes that like hey you can sit around here because At a certain point I don't get too much into it, but Johnny started saying well, you know we didn't I didn't have the right up bringing in all this and she's like hey dude No one made you quit school no one made you do this no one made you you did those things Um, but like you said these are these are These are people these are normal people these are people in the world these are people I grew up with these are my friends to this day People I met along the way Now That's kind of your main characters one more character I want to introduce and they look there's a bunch There are a lot more characters in the book I didn't say a lot more I tried to limit the number of characters as much as possible huh, so it's kind of like when you kind of Maybe cut it all the way down to what that's going on with that little transaction It's like you know like almost for like better way of putting it in the wild or in the you know nature whatever You put in this work so I think there's some I don't know there's probably some Chemical dopamine hit or whatever that get when you actually do something when you build something like I've built So like like redoing my house like re-mod like ripping out gutting my hat one time I did my kitchen and I gutted it In 72 hours I gutted the whole thing demoed it got it out I think we all know Arty we all know Jean we all know Johnny well know goat These are our people and there's the character development yeah, and look obviously there's more character Velpon that's goes on but you know For me to take the time to explain this this is one thing you're you're gonna notice when you read this book is I'm not I'm trying not to waste any time. yeah, nonetheless you're still gonna have like Like you know how there's like questions rolling around like what does this what does this mean like what's my take on this? Well, at this Wendy's when I worked there was there was a salad bar you know they have a salad bar at Wendy's I don't know they still have salad bar Wendy's not that I know of oh, I don't know so back in the day Back in the day they had a salad bar at Wendy's and the person that ran the salad bar That took care of the salad bar that we supplied the Peach slices and the Caesar salad dressing was this woman who clearly had she was probably I'm gonna say 55 maybe 60 years old so older woman thin Short hair her name was a gene and She obviously had you know So That's sort of this underlying team and I'll tell you like when I got to the teams thank god When I got to the teams that's when I started feeling like oh Like kind of happy like this is cool that people on with are kind of cool and life's not going to be perfect I wanted it to be when you heard someone I want you just to know who it is and boom your locked That was my goal simplicity There's another character That I want I do want to bring up because he does you got some he's got some a little bit of impact And this character as you heard from the review from the publisher weekly review Johnny and go they work at a big box store And their boss is this guy named Gerald Lundstrom Jerry also known as Jerry and they call him The Weasel that's what they call so let's get an introduction to Gerald Lundstrom the Weasel let's get an introduction to the big box store To what their jobs are and what they do there Their stock boys so here we go You would think Americans Survived on fucking mayonnaise goat says disgusted no shit Stockboys boxes tile floor and industrial shelves food detergent Electronics pretty much anything can be found here Every day from the time the doors open until they close there are customers here buying milk and batteries and toilet paper and garbage bags Tomatoes popcorn salami People can buy anything here and they do Consumption in massive quantities to fill their massive bellies and run up their massive credit card debt People flesh cover grow-bob beings in need of fuel and meaning They find both here I mean honestly who the fuck needs a half a gallon of miracle whip for their house goat asks Honestly trying to comprehend this madness well obviously a bunch of people need it all this will be gone in a couple of days Go shakes his head what the hell do they do with it And I was cool to you know, I'd always say hi, hi, Jean I know you know trying to talk to her a little bit and every time I would start a conversation with her Hey, Jean how are you you know, hey, Jean how's it going today and she'd be like I just opened up a new can of of Of of Coutons in the bar new a new can of sliced peaches. And I don't want to use the term depression because maybe you wrap all those things together because depression seems like it's a clinical Sort of like a problem that you treat type thing and I didn't feel like this was a clinical problem It just seemed like life to me Was not the gonna go the way you wanted it to go Go So we all know managers like this kind of a stereotypical manager And that's the way the world kind of gets put together for this book now Again, I don't want to spend I don't want to start covering the plot of the book you kind of heard it from the review a little bit of what happens in the plot You don't get the whole deal, but that's sort of the directional heading in gotta get the book to get there I mean you got to give me a raw bleeding piece of meat if you think I'm gonna return to the kitchen What about the wrong thing so you can use you straight up the wrong thing they mess your order up wrong thing is it Some mum down with You know like is it okay isn't like hey, I ordered the rib eye get a piece of primer But I did want to kind of just talk about some of the themes some of the other themes that are in the book One of them is is kind of this Ideal of being obsessed with random things which we all certainly do I do we all end up obsessed with these random things and if you look at it from the outside It doesn't make any sense so jiu jitsu surfing archery rock climbing music guitars NASCAR Leap lawn super into your lawn right super into fishing super into yoga super into cooking Super into grit like there's all these things that people just get into and That level of obsession Could be about anything right and that was that was one of the fun things that I had with already was I was thinking what would be the most random kind of thing that you could be obsessed with how about Laundry do laundry And I didn't even know if I could be it didn't seem like an achievable thing it seemed like there was too much It seemed like there was too much Underlying Things in the world that just are gonna be bad You know kind of a thing it's like a impulse by you ever get I don't see you doing this, but maybe you do I don't know, but you know when you shop it on Amazon right And Well, we were talking before the podcast about the young I think I think carry was saying you remember what it was like when you were younger and it was just all in kind of like you're just on board Right down for the call it's right down for the cause and that was The characteristic that I kind of tried to throw in here with goat was that characteristic of being down for the cause and what's cool What when you when you talked about Johnny being based on me There's parts definitely elements of me in Johnny for sure, but one of the elements that's that's from me in goat is just down for the cause I've been to stuff that you do in your 16 17 18 But yeah, they don't want us to win so Join the cause right Let's let's let's let's take the fight to them Get that first edition and here's the other thing I was planning to do a Speaking thing kind of like jockel live what we did last year right before COVID hit I was we were booking it up and the whole freaking The industry still paranoid and a bunch of the venues started getting crazy with the way they were gonna run them and some of them wanted to cancel I'm never going to be happy You know we were literally it's like a beautiful Southern California we're out in our surf spot For whatever reason there's not many guys out there's a little offshore breeze the waters warm It's a you know chest to head high swell pretty consistent like it's it doesn't get any better I mean the how many employees that they probably have Probably a total of 35 to 40 employees, you know day shift night shift You know everyone Everyone's part time, you know, so no one's really working so there's like probably 40 employees there total I'm just don't worry I am too she says with a smile So there's Jessica Again, where does Jessica come from kind of a composite character of Growing up of traveling If we've gone in different towns different cities Restaurants bars, you know, she's a waitress I know many Jessica's in my time and like you said I think we've all known plenty of Jessica's and and look she's hard working but that leave it behind just leave it behind it doesn't control your brain and how you think of energy drinks necessarily anymore if you know about Jocco go okay, I can is a discipline go or jocco go it is Jocco discipline go like I agree speaking I got corrected by someone on the inside which I respected by the way But either way Go Jocco discipline go said energy drink that is good for you front to back good for you not the kind where you drinking I want to but it's just this big black hole of Nothingness that I'm just left with except for yes like with that you you got to make of it Whatever you're gonna make of it, but yes, you know, so it's like how we merge back Arty So we got this guy Arty who You already heard about he's got some kind of mental challenges which I don't name in the book and the reason I didn't name him in the book is because A lot of times I've met people in my life where I know that they have some kind of mental challenge, but I don't know what it is.
