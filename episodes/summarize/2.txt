So when you get these little tidbits of people doing the same thing as you and it's like, dang, I'm relating to these people just in that small little way every day, or however often you check your Twitter, you know, and it's kind of refreshing and it reminds you that there are people like that out there, you know, who want to wake up early and be disciplined and work hard and then face the day and get stuff done or whatever. And you know, people, obviously when I made the decision with life that we were going to write this book, we knew that we were going to be out there and people were going to know us. You know, you used to dealing with guys when we were working hard, you know, training guys for combat or we were training for combat and you think, oh, well, you know, you got to let these guys get home to their families. And I think at this point, I, you know, three months into deployment, I think I needed some kind of mental escape, you know, at least, you know, I was, I was like dealing with combat all day. This probably isn't going to be anything new, but, you know, how you surround yourself with like nine people or you surround yourself by a certain types of people and you're going to start to become like that. And and it does give you absolutely gives you confidence and confidence that you can handle situation, confidence that that's coupled with the respect that you look at everyone and say, hey, you know what, this guy might be able to, this guy might know more than I do, so I'm going to respect him. You know, like you're, you know, if you have a weakness for beer and alcohol, then recognize that or have a weakness for giving up when I start to get tired and training or something like that, recognize that. But I don't think it is really ridiculous because if you kind of, if you break it down, I think like I said, they have a certain need that isn't obvious to everyone, you know, everyone, I said, even to them, it might not be obvious. Meaning if people had a charge of personnel and moving people around inside the military, they know they know little bits of information. So, and not necessarily jealous, so they're going to say, you know, they're going to lie to you and say, hey, that's a bad idea when it's really a good one or nothing like that. Like if there's lyrics, you know, but if it's like, um, like some piano or something like that. Like no one said, I don't know what any of these people look like, which I guess is kind of bizarre. And when he started training, after like a month, you know, I said, you know, what do you think of jujitsu? And it's always, it's one of those quotes that I have to push back on because they think I'm going to come in there like a drill instructor and park or there's a people who are going to, and it just doesn't work that way. and I would imagine that a lot of people are like that where if they have a lot going on in their life, you know, where they can't get these certain thoughts out of the head, go to bed. You know, so most people when you talk to people who have been doing it for over a year, talk to everyone, anyone you know that has been doing it more than one year, I would say my argument would be 85 percent or more. Include and included in life, life-babbin who, you know, one of my brothers who wrote extreme ownership with me and he's one of the guys that, you know, he's got his got his copy But the level of this, when I heard about the decision fatigue, the level that I heard this on was, like, every day, you know, you shouldn't think about what you're going to wear that day. Not a, you know, not a marathon and nothing like that, but you know what I'm going to do? A lot of the questions are about leadership and so I kind of as I thought about diving in a little bit to to this book and and talk about a little bit of course you could spend, you know, we could do 50 episodes, 10 hours each on this book. Little cycle of like you waking up at 4.30 in the morning, like me, like as a ritual, you know, that's one of them. I think there are ways to help, obviously, I think it's like through like a therapy type of situation, not necessarily like a professional therapy maybe, but not necessarily or something really impactful. But at the same time, you know that, hey, I'm going to be able to at least know what I'm doing very confidently. You know, when I was running land warfare training, you know, hey, should we give these guys a little extra time? People talking about Karen for your guys, and here's another good, you know, I, this is going back to the book.
