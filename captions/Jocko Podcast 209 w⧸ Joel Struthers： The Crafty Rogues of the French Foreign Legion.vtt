00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.20
This is Jocco podcast number 209 with echo Charles and me joccal willink

2
00:00:05.68 --> 00:00:07.68
Good evening, echo. Good evening

3
00:00:09.68 --> 00:00:11.68
We are crafty

4
00:00:11.68 --> 00:00:15.04
We are rogues. We are no ordinary men

5
00:00:16.20 --> 00:00:20.80
We've often got our black moods for we are Legionnaires

6
00:00:22.56 --> 00:00:27.40
In Tonkin the immortal Legion honored our flag at Tenguan

7
00:00:27.40 --> 00:00:31.96
Here is of camera on and model brothers

8
00:00:33.08 --> 00:00:35.72
Sleep in peace in your tombs

9
00:00:38.36 --> 00:00:42.36
Our ancestors knew to die for the glory of the Legion

10
00:00:44.44 --> 00:00:47.88
We will know to perish according to tradition

11
00:00:50.12 --> 00:00:54.36
During our far off campaigns facing fever and fire

12
00:00:54.36 --> 00:00:59.000
Let us forget along with our hardships death

13
00:01:00.52 --> 00:01:02.52
Which forgets us so little

14
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:06.04
for we are

15
00:01:07.16 --> 00:01:09.16
The Legion

16
00:01:12.28 --> 00:01:15.40
And those right there are the verses

17
00:01:17.24 --> 00:01:19.08
To the famous song

18
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:21.08
Le Boudin

19
00:01:22.60 --> 00:01:28.92
Which is I think the most famous of the songs of the French foreign Legion

20
00:01:29.88 --> 00:01:33.000
And the French foreign Legion is a

21
00:01:34.20 --> 00:01:36.04
famous

22
00:01:36.20 --> 00:01:43.72
Howlode military organization with a hitch a history steeped in traditions of bravery and courage

23
00:01:43.72 --> 00:01:47.000
And there's a lot of mistake around it

24
00:01:48.92 --> 00:01:53.64
It's also a very unique organization because the men of the French foreign Legion

25
00:01:55.24 --> 00:01:57.24
Generally are not French

26
00:01:58.12 --> 00:02:02.04
And one of their models which kind of reflects that is

27
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:12.20
Lazyotatria Nostra which translates to the Legion is our fatherland

28
00:02:14.20 --> 00:02:19.72
And when I was a kid growing up I was always kind of you hear I heard about the French foreign Legion

29
00:02:20.44 --> 00:02:24.52
And there was definitely a reputation of the kind of the reputation is that

30
00:02:25.24 --> 00:02:26.20
You could be

31
00:02:27.24 --> 00:02:31.56
Just a criminal somewhere and a scape prison

32
00:02:31.56 --> 00:02:37.32
And get to France and you could join the French foreign Legion and that's what that's what the French foreign Legion was filled with

33
00:02:38.84 --> 00:02:40.84
So that always had that kind of

34
00:02:41.16 --> 00:02:44.92
Misty around it and or around it and I read a book

35
00:02:47.08 --> 00:02:51.80
A long time ago called Legionnaire by Simon Murray which is a

36
00:02:52.36 --> 00:02:58.20
Great book and gives an incredible account and Simon Murray is a fascinating guy and I read another book

37
00:02:58.20 --> 00:03:02.20
That was called mouthful of rocks

38
00:03:03.56 --> 00:03:09.40
Which was by a guy named Christian Jennings and that one was is actually from a guy that the main

39
00:03:09.96 --> 00:03:13.96
The main theme of that book was do not join the French foreign Legion

40
00:03:13.96 --> 00:03:20.12
He was a deserter who ended up leaving it but but those books definitely left an impression on me about the French foreign Legion

41
00:03:20.68 --> 00:03:23.48
But today we're actually going to review another book

42
00:03:23.48 --> 00:03:27.48
By a Legionnaire. It's called a pel

43
00:03:28.52 --> 00:03:34.76
A French a Canadian in the French foreign Legion. It's written by a guy named Joel Strothers

44
00:03:36.20 --> 00:03:40.84
And it just turns out that we are lucky enough to have Joel here with us

45
00:03:41.80 --> 00:03:44.84
To discuss his book and his

46
00:03:45.32 --> 00:03:49.56
Experiences as a Legionnaire so Joel

47
00:03:49.56 --> 00:03:55.000
Welcome to the show man. Thank you, sir. It's an honor. Joel. Yeah, thanks for coming down

48
00:03:55.40 --> 00:03:57.40
It's uh, how did you end up?

49
00:03:58.12 --> 00:04:03.64
Did you send me this book how did this connect? I did. I've uh, I've obviously watched your familiar with your

50
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:09.08
Your history, your name and the the podcast and yeah, it was a hell Mary. I thought maybe a cinema book

51
00:04:10.52 --> 00:04:13.56
And maybe I you take interest in the uh in the subject matter

52
00:04:13.56 --> 00:04:20.04
Um, yeah, as you know marketing books these days it takes a lot of the efforts on the the right of themselves. They author so

53
00:04:20.36 --> 00:04:21.32
That was uh

54
00:04:21.32 --> 00:04:26.04
Yeah, my objective was it to get it to you and hopefully this would happen here we are and again

55
00:04:26.60 --> 00:04:29.72
I'm very appreciative. Yeah, no, it's a great book and I mean I've like I said

56
00:04:30.12 --> 00:04:33.40
Open it up the the French foreign Legion has such a mistake about it

57
00:04:33.96 --> 00:04:37.16
That the opportunity to sit down with someone that did time and

58
00:04:37.16 --> 00:04:41.24
And served and fought with the French foreign Legion seemed to me a awesome opportunity

59
00:04:41.24 --> 00:04:43.24
So um

60
00:04:44.28 --> 00:04:49.96
So yeah, that's that's where it starts and speaking of where it starts. Let's get to let's get to it, man

61
00:04:51.32 --> 00:04:53.32
Let's get to your start. Let's do it

62
00:04:54.92 --> 00:04:58.28
Do I say the word right a pal? Yep, that's a question a pill

63
00:04:59.40 --> 00:05:01.40
Which basically means

64
00:05:01.40 --> 00:05:04.68
It's what we get America we call quarters or like a

65
00:05:04.68 --> 00:05:11.80
A stand to attention the roll call yeah roll calls like that, but it doesn't it literally means stop your foot or something like that

66
00:05:11.80 --> 00:05:13.80
It could also be used as a call out

67
00:05:13.80 --> 00:05:15.80
um, double word

68
00:05:16.60 --> 00:05:21.40
Yeah, and eating you just yell a pal and then it comes and yeah, you're encounter four

69
00:05:21.40 --> 00:05:23.24
Okay, I don't got it and that's what it's

70
00:05:23.24 --> 00:05:27.24
Don't leave you so yeah for now check all right, so let's get to let's get to the book here a little bit

71
00:05:27.80 --> 00:05:31.48
You say my parents met as students at Canadian forces base

72
00:05:31.48 --> 00:05:36.44
Pettawaw Pettawaw and Ontario Canada and

73
00:05:37.32 --> 00:05:41.48
Started dating in grade 11 as a son of a fighter pilot in the Canadian Air Force

74
00:05:41.48 --> 00:05:45.72
I lived an inner-and-life style moving from one CFB to another

75
00:05:45.72 --> 00:05:48.44
1989 when my father retired as the commanding officer of

76
00:05:48.92 --> 00:05:53.24
441 tactical fighter squadron CFB cold lake Alberta

77
00:05:53.48 --> 00:05:58.36
We settled down in British Columbia Canada, so you grew up kind of military brat is what we call this right

78
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:00.36
I spent most of my time in Germany

79
00:06:00.36 --> 00:06:06.12
I'd have flew the the 104 the the widow maker. Oh really yeah, and then retired as a full current or a leg-conalsory

80
00:06:06.12 --> 00:06:08.12
They see 0 for 1 F-18s

81
00:06:08.52 --> 00:06:10.52
So yeah, it was every three years we would move

82
00:06:12.04 --> 00:06:16.28
Did you have any brothers or sisters no said one solo operations loan wolf

83
00:06:18.68 --> 00:06:20.68
Probably explains a lot

84
00:06:21.48 --> 00:06:25.24
From my earliest days I remember being interested in everything in the military at school

85
00:06:25.24 --> 00:06:28.36
I spent most of my time in classes drawing castles tanks and airplanes

86
00:06:28.36 --> 00:06:31.88
Is there anyone that didn't do that echo way you might be the one

87
00:06:31.88 --> 00:06:36.52
I think I think doctors and lawyers were the ones you didn't I did that yeah, yeah, I mean it's just like tanks

88
00:06:37.40 --> 00:06:42.84
Air planes battleships still job pretty good just wars yeah, I trust you can

89
00:06:44.76 --> 00:06:49.80
I visited countless museums and castles and played an old trenches and bunkers all over Europe once I found a key

90
00:06:50.04 --> 00:06:53.32
In a tower of the wall city of the Moroffenburg in Bavaria

91
00:06:53.32 --> 00:06:57.72
I was certainly what opened a dungeon my fascination with the military deepened with age

92
00:06:57.72 --> 00:07:04.12
So did my interest in sports my mother was very athletic she enrolled me from an early age in soccer basketball judo swimming in hockey

93
00:07:04.76 --> 00:07:06.28
How much judo?

94
00:07:06.28 --> 00:07:08.28
No enough

95
00:07:08.52 --> 00:07:12.68
Good answer there can never be enough, but will you were you serious about judo?

96
00:07:13.08 --> 00:07:18.52
No hockey took over pretty much early on. Oh, that's right your Canadian. Yeah, it was just like hockey or nothing

97
00:07:19.56 --> 00:07:26.12
She was also an an avid animal lover and I became one to aside from my mother my role models were predominantly

98
00:07:26.12 --> 00:07:34.44
fighter pilots and soldiers my dad and his friends as well as his dad his friend as well as my friends dad's and my grandfather's

99
00:07:35.08 --> 00:07:41.56
Even my hockey coaches were soldiers the military was in my blood and you actually I skipped over it

100
00:07:41.56 --> 00:07:47.64
But you actually have deep military blood in your family and so that was seem like it seemed like you got those jeans

101
00:07:48.12 --> 00:07:50.44
Yeah, for sure I definitely in the DNA somewhere

102
00:07:50.44 --> 00:07:57.88
Yeah, yeah after my first season playing triple a hockey I was invited the Western hockey leagues

103
00:07:58.44 --> 00:08:00.44
Rijina paths try out camp

104
00:08:00.84 --> 00:08:05.48
But my parents didn't let me attend because my school marks were too low the fact that I had been expelled from

105
00:08:05.64 --> 00:08:09.08
High School for a week for fighting held help my cause so you were

106
00:08:10.12 --> 00:08:14.44
I'm taking it you weren't exactly the model of behavior as a child

107
00:08:14.44 --> 00:08:23.64
Um, yeah, I don't know I mean I wasn't a bad kid about seating but I think I hit an age as we all do where I started to try to push barriers and figure out what I was made of

108
00:08:25.32 --> 00:08:28.12
And being a hockey fan there were certain type players that I

109
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:34.44
Respected or I wanted to emulate and I didn't necessarily have the the size or the chin to do so

110
00:08:34.44 --> 00:08:39.88
So my game kind of changed unfortunately for me, but yeah, that's kind of the the early onset to

111
00:08:39.88 --> 00:08:45.56
Apel is a young man trying to figure out what he's capable of and who he is now

112
00:08:46.60 --> 00:08:52.24
It's weird to that you know you had your dad was a who's he say he was a full-karner like

113
00:08:52.88 --> 00:08:56.92
Retentic on a retired like some kids that are grow up in that atmosphere

114
00:08:56.92 --> 00:09:03.24
They become kind of on the straight narrow path and you know what I mean and then some kids have a little bit of that

115
00:09:03.64 --> 00:09:07.36
Rebellion in them it sounds like you were a little bit more on the rebellion side

116
00:09:07.48 --> 00:09:09.48
Yeah, possibly

117
00:09:09.48 --> 00:09:15.96
But they they check that and I think deep down I knew what was I was wrong like I was braze properly had you know good parents

118
00:09:17.40 --> 00:09:21.24
But as you do you check you check yourself and you try to figure out what you're made of and

119
00:09:21.80 --> 00:09:24.28
Yeah, I figured out that that wasn't me. I wasn't you know

120
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
About as per say

121
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.84
Certainly wasn't gonna make the NHL with my my size of my hands of chin

122
00:09:31.48 --> 00:09:37.000
You you go on a little bit about this you know you talk about getting ejected for fighting a lot from hockey games

123
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.96
And then you say that the trouble started when I was fresh out of Langley secondary school without hockey experience a loss of direction

124
00:09:43.96 --> 00:09:49.98
Amit's mix of immaturity trying to impress friends and girls and reacting to other idiots

125
00:09:50.28 --> 00:09:54.52
All took their toll. I was hanging out the wrong crowd and these so-called friends were leading me nowhere

126
00:09:54.52 --> 00:10:01.64
The final twist in my downward spiral came when I was confronted by a RCMP

127
00:10:01.64 --> 00:10:07.38
Real Canadian mountain police special investigation officer revolver drawn I

128
00:10:07.82 --> 00:10:11.48
Was lucky I didn't end up in prison. What what what happened check?

129
00:10:12.20 --> 00:10:17.48
I don't think the why matters or the what it's more the why it was it was nothing

130
00:10:17.96 --> 00:10:22.48
You know, I'm sure imagination to a flow. There is no it's not drug related. It's not you know anything

131
00:10:22.92 --> 00:10:26.52
But it was dumb enough that the police took interest in my

132
00:10:26.52 --> 00:10:33.20
My association with there's certain people and you know, I wasn't I wasn't charged or I think but it was it was a good kick in the ass

133
00:10:34.20 --> 00:10:39.24
Experienced sitting down with my father who was visibly upset at the fact that potentially I'd be going to jail

134
00:10:39.64 --> 00:10:41.80
ruin your life and that yeah

135
00:10:41.80 --> 00:10:49.84
That's some straight seeing that reaction was sobering I guess we'd be the word and from there I took took ownership and

136
00:10:52.08 --> 00:10:55.10
There you go good call. Yeah. This is this is a big point

137
00:10:55.10 --> 00:11:01.42
You know you say here I realized that I needed to change and fast so I contacted the Canadian Armed Forces recruitment center in Vancouver

138
00:11:01.92 --> 00:11:06.98
Unfortunately the Canadian Armed Forces were no longer accepting applicants for regular force infantry positions

139
00:11:07.42 --> 00:11:14.74
My only option was to join a Canadian reserve unit and hope to be at the front of the recruitment line when the regular forces started to expand

140
00:11:15.14 --> 00:11:17.94
so I mean you get to this point and this is

141
00:11:19.46 --> 00:11:21.46
Man, it's so

142
00:11:21.46 --> 00:11:27.30
You're lucky, right you're lucky. You're actually lucky that this guy drew down on you you're lucky that you did something bad enough

143
00:11:27.70 --> 00:11:33.34
To get you to a point where you said all right, this is not gonna end well and

144
00:11:34.78 --> 00:11:38.66
Not every kid gets that opportunity and it'd be nice

145
00:11:39.62 --> 00:11:40.98
if

146
00:11:40.98 --> 00:11:43.38
a kid like listening to this right now

147
00:11:43.54 --> 00:11:47.78
Can foresee that they're gonna end up in that position and just go okay

148
00:11:47.78 --> 00:11:54.22
You know what I need to do change. I need to make a change right now because I know man the best thing that happened in my life was joining the military

149
00:11:54.22 --> 00:11:57.50
I would have been a total loser. I would have just ended up

150
00:11:58.02 --> 00:12:03.34
Doing I was just doing dumb stuff and I would have just continued down that path and I don't know if I had a

151
00:12:04.06 --> 00:12:11.62
A moment in time like you did where I said okay, I got to stop this but I definitely looked around at the people I was hanging around with and said yeah

152
00:12:11.90 --> 00:12:13.90
This isn't gonna end up well

153
00:12:14.46 --> 00:12:16.46
It'd be nice if

154
00:12:16.46 --> 00:12:18.46
kids that are

155
00:12:18.46 --> 00:12:19.26
15

156
00:12:19.26 --> 00:12:20.26
16

157
00:12:20.26 --> 00:12:21.26
17

158
00:12:21.26 --> 00:12:22.26
18

159
00:12:22.26 --> 00:12:25.06
19 years old instead of waiting for that moment to arrive

160
00:12:25.06 --> 00:12:28.58
Where they realize that a they're not as smart as I think they are and

161
00:12:29.02 --> 00:12:32.58
Be the direction that they're heading is not gonna end up well that they go, you know what?

162
00:12:33.30 --> 00:12:39.70
I need to kind of change direction here and boy the military offers especially I mean it's it's crazy too

163
00:12:39.70 --> 00:12:41.30
Like in Canada

164
00:12:41.30 --> 00:12:45.58
You can't even join regular force infantry. I mean let's face in America

165
00:12:45.58 --> 00:12:51.74
I'm not saying you can be they'll take anyone but if you want to be a grunt in the army or the Marine Corps

166
00:12:51.74 --> 00:12:56.78
Like there's a decent chance that you can do it. Yeah, fair one and this keep mine this is early 90s

167
00:12:56.78 --> 00:13:02.50
So nothing was going on the government at the time was you know checking their their budgets

168
00:13:02.50 --> 00:13:04.50
So it was cost cutting

169
00:13:04.50 --> 00:13:09.38
So yeah, there wasn't an opportunity to go right for us. There was other positions like a radar tech or 80

170
00:13:09.38 --> 00:13:17.66
But I wasn't you know, I'm for child a VHA's VHS tape of hamburger Hill and I watched the share of that thing and I was all about the infantry

171
00:13:17.66 --> 00:13:20.38
You know and my grandfather who's my dad's dad

172
00:13:21.38 --> 00:13:24.90
Third wave Juno Beach he had given me I didn't put in the book

173
00:13:24.90 --> 00:13:27.74
But he'd given me a jump smog from 100 first airborne

174
00:13:28.46 --> 00:13:33.42
Soldier pre-d day so when they're in England training and I wore I wore that and I think that was the

175
00:13:33.90 --> 00:13:37.14
The jump in me that you know, I mean I was but

176
00:13:37.14 --> 00:13:40.86
Yeah, I agree to your point the military certainly the Legion

177
00:13:41.26 --> 00:13:47.18
Got my shit together and that's a big reason for the book as I owe the Legion and France a lot for myself for

178
00:13:47.62 --> 00:13:52.56
How it it changed my life and that was my effort was to do so there give something back. I'll be at small

179
00:13:52.56 --> 00:14:00.62
It's certainly showed my appreciation so when you sign up you said you said you say I signed up with the Royal Westminster Regiment

180
00:14:00.62 --> 00:14:03.52
Westies based in New Westminster British Columbia

181
00:14:03.52 --> 00:14:08.28
The other Westies were assigned to support Canadian airborne regimen setting me on the path to become a fair trip or something

182
00:14:08.28 --> 00:14:13.12
I was interested in so this is you you're a reserveist. That's correct. You still go to boot camp

183
00:14:13.12 --> 00:14:16.96
Yeah, you do the same battle school basic is different, but you go into the same battle school

184
00:14:17.68 --> 00:14:23.26
And from there you'd support the PPC li if they had any taskings

185
00:14:23.70 --> 00:14:26.68
Overseas or whatever he would be that's the way the Canadian military was working

186
00:14:26.68 --> 00:14:30.06
They would be one third percent would be reservist militian in our case

187
00:14:30.06 --> 00:14:34.48
So that that was the objective and then if positions came available for a rig force

188
00:14:34.86 --> 00:14:41.08
You would be top the list to get into the get-in there and then they end up what they end up disbanding this regimen

189
00:14:41.08 --> 00:14:47.78
Yeah, so Somalia they're a Canadian airborne regimen. They had that incident in Somalia and it resulted in the mean

190
00:14:48.42 --> 00:14:50.66
Which incident? Yeah, they there was a

191
00:14:51.30 --> 00:14:54.74
They caught a local trying to steal food and it's either cap and he was

192
00:14:55.62 --> 00:14:57.62
I think it was four soldiers

193
00:14:57.62 --> 00:15:03.92
They tortured them and in the anti-Hey died and that got into the media and obviously as a result the government

194
00:15:03.92 --> 00:15:05.92
Disbanded the complete regimen

195
00:15:05.92 --> 00:15:11.50
So while that was happening all jump courses were put on standby and us as a regimen

196
00:15:11.50 --> 00:15:13.50
We were retasked to be anti-tank

197
00:15:15.74 --> 00:15:17.74
Basically which was a hard

198
00:15:18.46 --> 00:15:23.06
Moment for the regiment and what was an obviously appealing and for me that was you know, I was I was going

199
00:15:23.06 --> 00:15:25.62
That was a fun so you you mentally checked out

200
00:15:25.62 --> 00:15:28.64
And I called to actually I called the Marine Corps recruiter and

201
00:15:29.90 --> 00:15:32.40
Yeah, and the

202
00:15:32.40 --> 00:15:36.98
What they can Canadian student well at the time know you'd have to go through the whole process of applying for a green card

203
00:15:37.14 --> 00:15:40.86
So it take he said like two years man, huh? So I was like, you know, you're young and

204
00:15:41.70 --> 00:15:46.14
Zero patients two years is like the rest of your entire life. You can't ever wait two years

205
00:15:46.62 --> 00:15:50.74
But you could do it actually so if there's a young Canadian right now that's thinking Marine Corps

206
00:15:50.90 --> 00:15:52.42
Well, I think now it's a lot easier

207
00:15:52.42 --> 00:15:58.000
But again at the time there wasn't a lot going on so they're a little more selective, but yeah, that's what I was told two years minimum

208
00:15:58.72 --> 00:16:04.02
All right, so then you say during my time at P.P.C.L.I. Battle School one of our NCOs

209
00:16:04.02 --> 00:16:10.50
mentioned that a colleague of his had recently returned from France after serving in the French Foreign Legion's parachute regimen

210
00:16:10.50 --> 00:16:17.06
I was intrigued true. I'd heard of the Legion before but never really thought more of it or took it seriously to be honest

211
00:16:17.06 --> 00:16:23.22
But more recently the idea of being able to join an airborne regimen in a foreign country peak my sense of adventure

212
00:16:23.54 --> 00:16:25.82
Something that was seriously lacking in my life

213
00:16:25.82 --> 00:16:34.38
I eventually wrote to the French Foreign Legion's headquarters in France expressing my interest in joining this brought a quick reply from the Legion

214
00:16:34.38 --> 00:16:38.60
So so you wrote a you write them a letter. Yep, and then they write you back

215
00:16:38.60 --> 00:16:41.54
So I actually went down to the French consulate in Vancouver and

216
00:16:41.54 --> 00:16:48.50
Went to the front desk and asked the question kind of a strange look that I got back from the nicely, but they gave me an address and

217
00:16:49.14 --> 00:16:51.86
Yeah, I wrote a letter and letter came back with all the

218
00:16:53.46 --> 00:16:58.86
Information needed to to join so I read that a million times and

219
00:17:00.70 --> 00:17:02.70
Yeah, I was like I'm going

220
00:17:05.70 --> 00:17:09.62
How do you say the Legion in charge air in French?

221
00:17:09.62 --> 00:17:13.42
It's les gens et le tronjais. Oh god, I'm not even tried. I'm not gonna try it

222
00:17:13.42 --> 00:17:16.66
So the French Foreign Legion is no-no world over

223
00:17:18.02 --> 00:17:24.50
And fix in the poppy the minds and our images of Legionnaires wearing the characteristic white kept is that right kept

224
00:17:24.62 --> 00:17:29.68
Kepty caps trudging across African deserts on a merciless son to defend and outpost

225
00:17:29.94 --> 00:17:35.92
These men were petty thieves and criminals with dark paths as well as deserters from

226
00:17:36.08 --> 00:17:38.68
Foreign armies who had found a new home and

227
00:17:38.68 --> 00:17:44.60
Life in the ranks of the Legion some would call these men mercenaries what caught my attention?

228
00:17:44.60 --> 00:17:49.48
No, we're history books filled with black and white pictures of the legions first battalion

229
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:53.04
a torn jadr they parachutists

230
00:17:54.64 --> 00:17:57.94
Nailed it so did you say be here to say bap that

231
00:17:58.34 --> 00:18:04.20
So the first bet and the second battalion a torn jadr

232
00:18:04.20 --> 00:18:09.46
They parachutists or second bap jumping in French in Do China

233
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.40
The Legion I was interested in joining had evolved into a modern elite fighting force

234
00:18:16.20 --> 00:18:20.36
So I was racist and not willing to settle for average life my mind was made up

235
00:18:20.36 --> 00:18:22.36
I was going to join the French Foreign Legion

236
00:18:23.40 --> 00:18:29.04
Dad looked at me sternly and shook my hand. He wished me locks saying call us when you get the chance

237
00:18:29.04 --> 00:18:33.28
I made my way to the train station to continue my journey to Stratzburg France

238
00:18:33.28 --> 00:18:38.76
Second thoughts anxiety and excitement were fighting in my mind, but there was no way I was turning back

239
00:18:38.76 --> 00:18:43.52
And I always have to say this obviously I'm not reading this whole book right now. I'm skipping over big chunks

240
00:18:44.20 --> 00:18:48.50
Where you have really interesting details you kind of spell it out like your dad was

241
00:18:49.20 --> 00:18:52.36
airline pilots you had the opportunity to get over there and

242
00:18:54.88 --> 00:18:59.48
This is when you get and then the reason I think I highlighted this was because once again

243
00:18:59.48 --> 00:19:01.48
I think a lot of people that listen to this are

244
00:19:01.48 --> 00:19:03.48
Well, they're young

245
00:19:04.60 --> 00:19:10.20
Individuals thinking about joined the military. I was gonna say young men, but I just met a female in Australia

246
00:19:10.44 --> 00:19:13.48
That was like oh, I joined the Air Force because you're podcast. I'm in the Air Force right now

247
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:17.56
She's like from listening to your podcast. I was like, well, that's awesome. So young people

248
00:19:18.72 --> 00:19:21.20
When they're thinking about joined the military and

249
00:19:22.36 --> 00:19:25.96
They have exactly what you have second thoughts anxiety and

250
00:19:26.72 --> 00:19:30.40
Excitement we're all fighting because you're excited to do it, but then you're scared you're nervous

251
00:19:30.40 --> 00:19:32.40
So

252
00:19:32.20 --> 00:19:38.44
There's I think I guess my point in saying this is that it's pretty normal to have those feelings true

253
00:19:38.44 --> 00:19:42.48
I'll be at I'm in France. I can't go home. So there's that difference

254
00:19:45.40 --> 00:19:49.000
If I may interject my grandfather my mum's dad who retired a three-star

255
00:19:49.92 --> 00:19:51.92
Before I left he

256
00:19:51.92 --> 00:19:53.92
He was my hero as I mentioned the other book

257
00:19:55.12 --> 00:19:57.12
one the DSO

258
00:19:57.12 --> 00:20:04.44
He had said to me are you sure any and when I said yes, I'm sure this is what I'm doing so well if you do go there and represent your country well

259
00:20:04.84 --> 00:20:08.12
So I always had that in the back of mind as you know as soon as I knocked on that door

260
00:20:08.12 --> 00:20:10.84
I was representing Canada somewhat

261
00:20:12.24 --> 00:20:18.000
And yeah, but I as I you know I mentioned the book I said there across the street for a good chunk of time looking at that door

262
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.64
Thinking damn I've got myself

263
00:20:21.36 --> 00:20:24.08
Quite the situation here, but time to pull through

264
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.76
Yeah

265
00:20:26.76 --> 00:20:32.76
You're at the Straussburg train station wave down a taxi driver and rusty French explain how good was your French?

266
00:20:32.76 --> 00:20:35.68
I took at the Canadian military school system and his French immersion

267
00:20:35.68 --> 00:20:39.52
So I took which is basically half English half French. I took that to create it

268
00:20:39.52 --> 00:20:44.48
So I had a good base which I think was a huge factor in my decision to go that's a challenge

269
00:20:44.48 --> 00:20:49.96
It's if you don't speak the language in rusty French explain my destination in the driver the legions recruitment depot

270
00:20:49.96 --> 00:20:56.64
Look looking surprised he turned to me and asked are you certain? La Liseon is a tough life when I said yes

271
00:20:56.64 --> 00:20:58.24
He replied you crazy

272
00:20:58.24 --> 00:21:04.08
Then he turned back around put the car and gear and accelerated into Straussburg's evening traffic

273
00:21:05.64 --> 00:21:08.64
How proud were you to say take me to the Legion?

274
00:21:08.64 --> 00:21:15.08
I mean when I was a kid I remember we got this uh when we got done with the dive phase of seal training

275
00:21:15.08 --> 00:21:21.20
They gave us this little the US Navy qualified diver card and it and the specification

276
00:21:21.20 --> 00:21:22.72
I think it said

277
00:21:22.72 --> 00:21:28.40
5320 which meant we were in still in training because 5326 would be year a seal

278
00:21:28.40 --> 00:21:34.68
But 5320 and then it said like in parentheses something like combat diver and so we got this card

279
00:21:34.68 --> 00:21:37.84
I mean I'm Nike years old and I pretty much thought I was a cool as a guy

280
00:21:38.64 --> 00:21:40.64
Like if somebody needed to see my ID

281
00:21:40.64 --> 00:21:42.64
Maybe I'd have to use that for that

282
00:21:42.64 --> 00:21:51.72
But even just that right there of yeah feeling how did that feel I think it was more thinking about what's what's coming next

283
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.84
Gonna really give a shit about the touchy drum

284
00:21:59.28 --> 00:22:01.28
Me I wanted to impress that taxing

285
00:22:02.36 --> 00:22:04.36
Take me to the Legion

286
00:22:04.36 --> 00:22:12.32
Um, the yeah man when you're 1918 you're dumb. Well, maybe you were you sounds like you were supposed to be smarter than I was about

287
00:22:12.32 --> 00:22:14.32
I was 22

288
00:22:14.32 --> 00:22:17.16
I was a little bit older service for a little bit. But I wasn't I was still dumb

289
00:22:17.72 --> 00:22:19.72
Yeah, there's no question

290
00:22:19.72 --> 00:22:27.28
The Straussburg Legion recruitment depot was a first world war era whitewash three story building facing a large playground

291
00:22:27.28 --> 00:22:34.44
Partially abandoned barracks. It's now used as a post that recruitment the l'Aligion they call jac

292
00:22:34.44 --> 00:22:36.44
My saying that yes, sir

293
00:22:36.68 --> 00:22:43.32
With the cold war over there was no longer a need for the large military units and therefore sprawling military barracks

294
00:22:43.32 --> 00:22:46.88
The entrance to the PR LE was a metal door

295
00:22:46.88 --> 00:22:52.72
Set into a three meter high wall top of the razor wire a solitary light cleared down from above

296
00:22:52.72 --> 00:22:56.16
Inscribed on the door with three words

297
00:22:57.28 --> 00:22:59.44
L'Aigio patria nostra. How do you say that?

298
00:22:59.84 --> 00:23:04.76
L'Aigion patria nostra. Okay, the Legion is our father land

299
00:23:05.72 --> 00:23:09.44
Which is a which is a bold statement, you know, it's their way of saying

300
00:23:10.48 --> 00:23:12.48
You're gonna be from all these different countries and

301
00:23:13.36 --> 00:23:18.000
But those aren't those aren't your father land anymore your father lives are over the Legion. Yeah

302
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.12
Sir, yeah, then you talked about your stalling sitting across the street looking at the door

303
00:23:25.28 --> 00:23:27.92
Knowing that after you go in there suck it up

304
00:23:27.92 --> 00:23:32.56
I just go for you. Game all this way, but yeah, I definitely how long do you sit there for?

305
00:23:32.56 --> 00:23:37.12
I think it was even more than an hour enough time to get bored sitting there

306
00:23:37.92 --> 00:23:45.000
Yeah last moments of freedom how much intel did you have not much because that was the issues is pre-internet really

307
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.40
There was Legion air that you mentioned the book which had red and that was definitely a a big part of my joining

308
00:23:51.40 --> 00:23:55.52
I read them off full of rocks, but again as you mentioned, dessert didn't take into account

309
00:23:55.76 --> 00:24:00.36
That was just you know, so on writing their own narrative and then the history books

310
00:24:00.36 --> 00:24:05.80
You know seeing the the beps jumping into China and then Algeria that for me was the

311
00:24:07.56 --> 00:24:14.56
The main I guess history and knowledge that I could gain and from there was just mostly visually

312
00:24:14.56 --> 00:24:16.96
Not a cool ongoing. Yeah, it wasn't a ton of

313
00:24:17.44 --> 00:24:23.36
Of anymore what about intel as far as what the indoctrination phases were gonna be like I didn't know much

314
00:24:23.72 --> 00:24:27.48
Whatever the books talked about and all that being said Legion. I was a 60s

315
00:24:27.48 --> 00:24:30.08
That was the French endow China early F French Algerian war

316
00:24:30.72 --> 00:24:34.24
So time it passed, but I didn't know much. Yeah, that was the big

317
00:24:34.72 --> 00:24:38.48
Question mark is what comes next same for me. You're on a seal training nowadays

318
00:24:38.68 --> 00:24:43.36
Obviously you can pretty much observe seal training on YouTube

319
00:24:43.36 --> 00:24:46.72
You can see what's going on. I had no no zero idea

320
00:24:46.72 --> 00:24:51.12
There was one like 15 minute video that the recruiter would show, but it didn't show you very much

321
00:24:51.12 --> 00:24:55.20
And I don't know whether that's better or worse because you don't even know you just

322
00:24:55.48 --> 00:24:59.40
You just like you said you get ready to suck it up and just whatever they throw at me is fine

323
00:24:59.40 --> 00:25:00.40
You have

324
00:25:00.40 --> 00:25:05.52
You can't even look at the long term suffering because you even know what it's what's gonna come so

325
00:25:06.32 --> 00:25:08.80
And at that age we don't we don't think much far ahead

326
00:25:08.80 --> 00:25:14.88
Do he had just more action yeah, no, and I messed up as I was saying before we started recording like I didn't care

327
00:25:15.16 --> 00:25:17.80
Yeah, what they were gonna do to me. It didn't didn't matter

328
00:25:18.80 --> 00:25:23.16
Even if they were even if they were gonna kill me it was like, okay, well, bring it yeah

329
00:25:23.16 --> 00:25:27.16
At that point I didn't know too that this wasn't a given you don't just show up and join

330
00:25:27.16 --> 00:25:32.12
They take everybody there was a selection process. I think the big one for me was you know get in

331
00:25:32.12 --> 00:25:35.26
Because I didn't want to go back with my tail between my legs and getting in you know

332
00:25:35.26 --> 00:25:37.26
That would be a huge

333
00:25:37.26 --> 00:25:38.26
Yeah

334
00:25:38.26 --> 00:25:43.26
Yes, you know you don't want to see go back into your grandfather. Yeah, I didn't even get in the fridge for

335
00:25:45.26 --> 00:25:49.50
So here we go. I stood up enough stalling. I told myself I crossed the street walk to the door

336
00:25:49.50 --> 00:25:55.26
Ring the doorbell it didn't make any noise after what seemed like minutes a large man taller than me and a lot more imposing

337
00:25:55.26 --> 00:25:58.42
Dressed and khaki green army combat uniform finally opened the door

338
00:25:58.42 --> 00:26:03.94
Yes, I see my passport. I handed it to him you join Legion. He asked a broken English. We I replied

339
00:26:04.30 --> 00:26:07.02
He glanced at my passport again Canadian. We and

340
00:26:07.02 --> 00:26:09.02
So then you roll in and

341
00:26:10.34 --> 00:26:16.32
They put in a video cassette that was given you basically the outline of the Legion's history

342
00:26:16.32 --> 00:26:20.12
Yeah, they had a cassette for every language in the old VHS machine

343
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:26.60
I will TV and he's set there for whatever took 25 minutes and he just watched their presentation on

344
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.10
Well, you're both a join. Yeah, so that was actually my first real bit of

345
00:26:31.98 --> 00:26:34.86
Lessons on the on the totality of what the Legion was

346
00:26:34.86 --> 00:26:40.66
But in it there was you know shots of the the rep jumping and so I was just like yeah, that's we're good

347
00:26:40.66 --> 00:26:44.10
Let's I don't need to watch this tape. You got it. You're not gonna say shift to the

348
00:26:44.82 --> 00:26:46.82
No, you're gonna put it in

349
00:26:48.34 --> 00:26:52.52
Carries on a bit why do you want to join the Legion? I want a soldier. I replied

350
00:26:52.70 --> 00:26:56.82
No one can do a poker face like a foreign Legion recruitment enceo without speaking

351
00:26:56.82 --> 00:27:03.02
He placed a document in front of me that stated my acceptance into the prevolent to your face the legions initial five-year contract

352
00:27:03.02 --> 00:27:07.06
He motioned for me to sign it marking my first major step into the ranks of the Legion

353
00:27:07.06 --> 00:27:13.62
I was aware of the initial five-year commitment the letter I received from the Legion prior to flying to France clearly

354
00:27:13.62 --> 00:27:16.38
Outwind what was expected without hesitation

355
00:27:16.38 --> 00:27:19.38
I leaned forward and signed the document. It was September 8th

356
00:27:20.18 --> 00:27:21.54
1994

357
00:27:21.54 --> 00:27:23.54
So there you go you're in

358
00:27:23.54 --> 00:27:24.54
Ish

359
00:27:24.54 --> 00:27:26.54
Well you're in for

360
00:27:27.18 --> 00:27:31.10
For if you make it through the selection phase. Yeah, correct. Yeah, that's just a little bit

361
00:27:31.10 --> 00:27:37.02
Yeah, yeah, and the weird thing is you're in I mean we'll talk more about it

362
00:27:37.02 --> 00:27:43.22
But there's people deserving all the time like just like just leaving. Yeah escaping basically

363
00:27:44.50 --> 00:27:46.50
Which is kind of funny. Yeah

364
00:27:47.98 --> 00:27:50.06
Because any and you know you

365
00:27:50.06 --> 00:27:52.06
Well cover it, but

366
00:27:52.22 --> 00:27:56.66
You don't want a guy that that wants to leave. You don't want a guy that's not doesn't want to be there to be there

367
00:27:56.66 --> 00:27:58.50
No, and they've been doing this for a long time

368
00:27:58.50 --> 00:28:02.38
They know what it takes and the right type of candidate to choose so that's the first step

369
00:28:02.38 --> 00:28:08.46
They look at the basic information that they have and they go from there and they've been fairly successful

370
00:28:08.46 --> 00:28:10.46
Oh, what they do? So

371
00:28:10.46 --> 00:28:12.50
So now you go to Obanya Obanya Obanya

372
00:28:12.50 --> 00:28:16.54
Oh, buying. Oh, buying. So they do a pre-medical exam prior to that

373
00:28:16.54 --> 00:28:22.14
So they really check the sound of body and all that kind of stuff to make sure that you physically fit and then off you go to Obanya

374
00:28:22.14 --> 00:28:27.14
And did you say did you say broke like if you had broken bones you couldn't join? Yeah bad teeth was a big one too

375
00:28:27.14 --> 00:28:34.42
Yeah, they look for the basics and he scars showing your previous injuries when you mean bad teeth like crooked teeth

376
00:28:34.42 --> 00:28:36.94
Yeah, I don't know what exactly look for but they spent a lot of time

377
00:28:36.94 --> 00:28:43.70
We send a dentist chair and they go they go at it and guys were were cut because they had teeth now

378
00:28:43.70 --> 00:28:50.38
I don't know if that shows bad bone structure bad DNA or it's gonna cause them problems down the road where they have to do dental work

379
00:28:50.38 --> 00:28:54.40
But especially overseas. I think that's they take teeth into consideration

380
00:28:54.40 --> 00:28:55.40
Oh, yeah

381
00:28:55.40 --> 00:28:57.40
Yeah

382
00:28:57.74 --> 00:29:02.18
So now you end up in Obanya correct. I'm getting there, right? That's correct. Yeah

383
00:29:03.64 --> 00:29:09.88
We joined groups of volunteers from other recruitment centers numbering well over a hundred and lined up in single file on the parade square

384
00:29:09.88 --> 00:29:12.64
opposite the basement entrance of a single story building

385
00:29:12.64 --> 00:29:16.80
Our wallets money and watches were taken away and sealed inside individually labeled

386
00:29:16.80 --> 00:29:22.90
Manila envelopes closed and shoes were also taken from us and stored either in military duffle bags or if deemed adequate

387
00:29:22.90 --> 00:29:29.64
Arceviline bags we were then issued personal toiletries t-shirts a pair of white sports shorts

388
00:29:29.64 --> 00:29:36.08
Socks underwear a single towel and a small padlock for a personal locker in the barracks rooms

389
00:29:36.70 --> 00:29:40.66
Those without proper running shoes were handed hard sold a deedess runners

390
00:29:41.54 --> 00:29:47.46
Around us men were speaking in a variety of languages unfamiliar to me all orders were another information

391
00:29:47.46 --> 00:29:52.40
We're given in French and quickly translated to out to the others by those who understood

392
00:29:53.12 --> 00:29:59.06
So this is your kind of a standard boot camp scenario. We're gonna get rid of your

393
00:30:00.58 --> 00:30:05.30
Get rid of your individuality somewhat still at the recruiting phase

394
00:30:05.30 --> 00:30:09.82
So we're not even when you do get chosen you go off and do your basic which is four months at another regiment

395
00:30:09.82 --> 00:30:14.82
This is just screening really get a still screen. Yeah, so all the different recruitment

396
00:30:14.82 --> 00:30:20.66
Sites of the heaven France they all ship the volunteers to O'Buyne and then there they

397
00:30:20.66 --> 00:30:25.06
They start doing their triage basically would be the right word and from there they'll do their

398
00:30:25.74 --> 00:30:28.34
selection background checks more medical stuff physical fitness

399
00:30:29.90 --> 00:30:32.66
Reviews and from there they'll pick their their Legionnaires

400
00:30:33.30 --> 00:30:41.62
Or to be yeah to be attempted correct. Oh the final phase of the evaluation referred to as the Gestapo was the most discussed among potential recruits

401
00:30:41.62 --> 00:30:45.10
The officer and NCOs conducting that this phase were from the Legionnaires

402
00:30:46.42 --> 00:30:48.42
Internal security

403
00:30:48.42 --> 00:30:56.02
This immediately dispelled one of the Legion's greatest myths no questions asked in fact the Gestapo asked plenty of questions and dug deep clearing our names through

404
00:30:56.22 --> 00:31:02.70
Interpol so that what I was saying earlier about how you could be this random criminal and just go join the French foreign Legion in your past as race

405
00:31:02.70 --> 00:31:06.30
It's not like that apparently not anymore originally back when it was initially

406
00:31:06.30 --> 00:31:14.06
Designed it was to have soldiers to go to France as your rework that word French so they would take whoever they could or

407
00:31:14.06 --> 00:31:18.30
They would give criminals the opportunity to not serve the time and prison and join the Legion

408
00:31:18.58 --> 00:31:24.26
But you know as the Legion grew and became a little more professional and a part of the French military

409
00:31:24.26 --> 00:31:29.30
Then it was it was a different system they basically selected what they could the best of what showed up

410
00:31:30.18 --> 00:31:32.38
So this is the the process they start doing there

411
00:31:32.38 --> 00:31:36.86
Through background checks and make sure that you you need a valid passport obviously

412
00:31:37.42 --> 00:31:41.94
No major criminal fences and then have the physical

413
00:31:42.54 --> 00:31:47.62
Attributes to make a good soldier and they take one in one in 12. I think when I was there

414
00:31:47.90 --> 00:31:54.82
One in 12 applicants get through now. It's more 115. Wow. Yeah, so that's one in 12 that actually show up. Yeah, correct

415
00:31:54.82 --> 00:32:02.42
Yeah, the biggest groups hailed from the former eastern block countries Russia Poland Ukraine

416
00:32:02.42 --> 00:32:10.02
Romania hung hungry Slovakia and Czech Republic. We commonly we commonly refer to them as a

417
00:32:10.02 --> 00:32:12.02
Comunists the communist

418
00:32:12.02 --> 00:32:15.22
Which I got to take out of this is what the United States so the walls come down

419
00:32:15.22 --> 00:32:21.80
There's a lot of guys coming down to join just to get a I'm yield ticket and to get out of tough times up up across the

420
00:32:21.80 --> 00:32:23.80
field wall yeah

421
00:32:25.36 --> 00:32:30.80
When they get done when you get done do you do you become a French citizen when you're done you can apply

422
00:32:31.80 --> 00:32:36.000
I didn't for example, but yeah, you can apply it's not a given if you're injured in battle

423
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
You are given French citizenship

424
00:32:38.32 --> 00:32:42.84
But yeah, most of the people will apply after five years and they're pretty they're pretty good at it issuing

425
00:32:44.80 --> 00:32:51.28
Three weeks in it was a great relief that I was called out of the ranks with several others and issued secondhand combat pants jacket

426
00:32:51.28 --> 00:32:56.92
About boots our heads were shaved and we moved to a cramp smelly building in the volunteer compound which

427
00:32:57.68 --> 00:33:00.96
Which we spent our time trying to clean a few days later

428
00:33:01.28 --> 00:33:06.84
We were several of us from the group were issued a red plastic epilet

429
00:33:07.28 --> 00:33:14.68
We were now rouge signifying that we had passed the Legion recruitment process and we were bound for basic training now known as

430
00:33:14.72 --> 00:33:16.72
Lays aruges

431
00:33:16.72 --> 00:33:23.40
We passed individually before a kernel in the regiments HQ to sign our initial five-year contract with the Legion

432
00:33:24.16 --> 00:33:27.60
We also received our Legion service numbers mine was

433
00:33:28.84 --> 00:33:30.84
1-8-5-6-8-9

434
00:33:31.96 --> 00:33:37.92
Yes, so we're through so I'm in and that was probably the worst part of my experience in the Legion. I thought it was about experience

435
00:33:37.92 --> 00:33:43.88
But that was definitely the the least enjoyable. We're just the whole yeah the atmosphere and processing if I don't know what prisons like

436
00:33:43.88 --> 00:33:50.20
But that was kind of my my go to experience yeah, you know, they're just a bunch of me the heads around everyone's kind of you don't know what's happening

437
00:33:50.84 --> 00:33:54.92
Yeah, it was taking one out of every 12. Yeah, yeah, and then every day

438
00:33:54.92 --> 00:34:01.92
There'll be a roll call the yellow and a whole bunch of names and those guys you're out you just go off to the side to go back and get your kit and those send you back to your original

439
00:34:03.44 --> 00:34:11.20
Spot that you applied and that's it you're done so every day you'd be in roll call and you've just hoping your name didn't get going and how long was this time period?

440
00:34:11.20 --> 00:34:15.76
It took about a month for this to happen now

441
00:34:17.04 --> 00:34:22.08
It varies and then there's another you say at this point a Legion myth was dispelled

442
00:34:22.72 --> 00:34:26.78
for a short administrative period of time we were

443
00:34:27.52 --> 00:34:32.88
Olm's songs norm men without names and those who needed an alias would be provided with one

444
00:34:32.88 --> 00:34:40.40
And so that so you used to be that you could just go in there and change your name and it sounds like you still could if you wanted to

445
00:34:40.40 --> 00:34:44.40
Yeah, but it's not mandatory exactly so for the Eastern countries

446
00:34:44.64 --> 00:34:46.96
It's illegal for them to serve in a foreign military

447
00:34:47.04 --> 00:34:49.60
So for that reason the legal issue them a false name

448
00:34:50.32 --> 00:34:53.76
Typically a Swiss based on a Swiss passport Canadian passport and

449
00:34:54.24 --> 00:35:00.08
They use that for a duration of their career before they can go through an administrative process to get their name back

450
00:35:00.08 --> 00:35:03.68
In my case I was Canadian that's not an issue so I kept my name

451
00:35:07.88 --> 00:35:14.08
So but if the country finds out what that name was and they call an astleagent is you know Simon Murray

452
00:35:14.72 --> 00:35:16.72
In your ranks thought off to say yes

453
00:35:17.52 --> 00:35:20.92
So it's up to you to the main tandy and a minute. You guys would be the work

454
00:35:22.96 --> 00:35:29.44
It was a lot of me how quickly I'd become detached from my previous life and tethered to a new one that was still being shaped while cleaning the center

455
00:35:29.44 --> 00:35:36.24
Two guys in our group were caught speaking Polish to each other although talking in any language besides French had been accepted over the past few weeks

456
00:35:36.24 --> 00:35:45.28
We soon learned that it was no longer tolerated to demonstrate his displeasure a corporal need one of the polls in his midsection and then ordered him to do pushups while he was doing pushups the corporal

457
00:35:46.16 --> 00:35:49.12
Kicked him in his ribs demanding that he pick up the pace

458
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.32
This was our first taste of the legions discipline and a revelation

459
00:35:54.32 --> 00:35:59.80
Indeed, so yeah our corporal's a sergeant and our corporal showed up from the catch-brem

460
00:35:59.80 --> 00:36:04.98
Allure which is the training regimen that will be going to and this is them taking us for run and

461
00:36:05.52 --> 00:36:09.84
Or take us out and that's where we see the first sign of what's to come

462
00:36:10.48 --> 00:36:13.68
It was interesting. I thought it was actually kind of kind of cool

463
00:36:13.68 --> 00:36:18.48
I don't know that sounds right, but it's more like yeah, this is you know yeah my experience in Canadian military was was good

464
00:36:18.68 --> 00:36:20.08
But it wasn't

465
00:36:20.08 --> 00:36:25.96
Tough if that's the right word and this seemed to me like the right attitude and plus you just spent like

466
00:36:26.16 --> 00:36:30.44
Whatever three or four weeks in this kind of jail scenario and

467
00:36:31.12 --> 00:36:35.64
Not doing any real training and all of a sudden it's starting it's starting exactly so you got momentum

468
00:36:35.64 --> 00:36:39.76
It's you're going you're in the right direction. So it's it's all good is it?

469
00:36:40.40 --> 00:36:42.40
Interesting that

470
00:36:43.76 --> 00:36:47.60
That that's just in your mind you're thinking right on

471
00:36:47.60 --> 00:36:53.36
Because that's what I'm saying good. I'm like yeah, or especially if they deserve it. Yeah, yeah, well for sure

472
00:36:53.36 --> 00:36:57.52
Yeah, and it's as I said they they know what to do and this is how they weed out the

473
00:36:57.96 --> 00:37:01.28
The week or those that aren't meant to be there if you can't handle

474
00:37:01.88 --> 00:37:07.14
Need of the gut and some kicks of the side, you know, look at you in the trenches and shit goes wrong

475
00:37:07.14 --> 00:37:09.14
Yeah, we're good at you in life as that

476
00:37:10.40 --> 00:37:12.40
Oh, yeah

477
00:37:13.20 --> 00:37:15.20
Awesome now

478
00:37:15.20 --> 00:37:19.16
Let's see I think this is when you get to a castel correct saying that right yep

479
00:37:19.32 --> 00:37:23.56
So the castel is this is where sort of where's starting that is the drill train

480
00:37:23.56 --> 00:37:30.48
Yeah, great basic training our first lesson in how life would be as a recruiting castel came via a ritual known as a pal

481
00:37:31.04 --> 00:37:34.80
All 25 of us lined up in the hallway along the wall shoulders touching

482
00:37:34.80 --> 00:37:38.12
We then countered off in French each yelling the number the next number in succession

483
00:37:38.56 --> 00:37:44.000
To ensure all section members were present and accounted for the corporal per proud up and down the ranks and

484
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.72
Flicting immediate punishment in the form of a slap to the face or a need of the stomach if there was a miss count at one point

485
00:37:49.72 --> 00:37:56.36
Alistair after receiving a verbal lashing and a hard open-handed slap across the face for getting his number wrong said to the corporal

486
00:37:56.36 --> 00:38:00.04
But I don't speak French corporal. I couldn't help but laugh just a little

487
00:38:00.04 --> 00:38:05.08
It's the French foreign Legion after all. I was damn lucky to have basic French knowledge on my side

488
00:38:05.68 --> 00:38:12.64
A pal would become a routine in our our lives. It's intent was to quickly identify anyone who might have decided to

489
00:38:12.64 --> 00:38:19.12
Desert it was also a fast and effective way to gather a section together to issue orders our first morning a pal

490
00:38:19.96 --> 00:38:22.24
Alistair and a Norwegian were missing

491
00:38:22.24 --> 00:38:29.74
Deserted apparently they had jumped the regiment wall just hours prior this seems strange to me like what had they been expecting with basic training

492
00:38:29.74 --> 00:38:32.44
They hadn't even lasted 24 hours in castel

493
00:38:33.88 --> 00:38:39.46
Morning new to night our section now 23 men would form up and march from the company barracks to the mess hall

494
00:38:39.46 --> 00:38:44.68
A corporal would set the pace calling out the slow Legion pace at 88 steps per minute

495
00:38:45.14 --> 00:38:51.46
During the first few days are attempt to maintain the timing as well as the proper intervals between our rows were

496
00:38:51.46 --> 00:39:00.42
Ragged in hindsight. It was comical the other corporals positioned at our size attempted to instill order by yelling at us and hitting anyone who fell out of step

497
00:39:00.70 --> 00:39:06.46
Whether being struck and shouted at helped anyone improve was debatable

498
00:39:06.46 --> 00:39:12.70
So this is where it kicks off and if you see the French foreign Legion marching you guys march at

499
00:39:13.06 --> 00:39:20.18
88 beats per minute, which is which is like a third maybe or a quarter slower than the normal yeah correct march

500
00:39:20.18 --> 00:39:21.18
Yeah

501
00:39:21.18 --> 00:39:23.18
Is that is that harder

502
00:39:23.74 --> 00:39:29.50
Is that out of sync with normal walking pit is yeah, I think that's the challenge as you got to slow yourself down

503
00:39:29.50 --> 00:39:39.70
Yeah, and then they introduce the music we'll get there. Yeah, yeah, when it wasn't possible for us to do a single more push up

504
00:39:39.70 --> 00:39:43.78
The again I'm fast forwarding, but when it wasn't possible for us to do a single more push up

505
00:39:43.78 --> 00:39:49.14
We were made to assume stress positions in push-ups stance knees off the ground with our asses in the air

506
00:39:49.14 --> 00:39:53.32
Anyone who faltered and dropped was kicked until he managed to regain its his stance

507
00:39:54.14 --> 00:39:57.42
Yes, so there's nothing mean about it

508
00:39:57.42 --> 00:40:01.50
They're just trying to figure out whether or not you want to be there and if you don't well, you know

509
00:40:01.98 --> 00:40:05.34
Well that being said you you got to do your your four months of basic

510
00:40:05.34 --> 00:40:09.38
You can decide to leave at the end of basic, but they're they're definitely putting up the pressure on early

511
00:40:10.62 --> 00:40:15.98
And if people deserve they they know but they don't you've done them a favor really

512
00:40:16.38 --> 00:40:23.26
Yeah, yeah, made it easy for them exactly the punishment's varied and largely came down to the corpals imagination

513
00:40:23.26 --> 00:40:27.94
Which I can only imagine what that what that ends up looking like

514
00:40:31.22 --> 00:40:35.74
So then he what when did you go to the farm when does that happen? Once we were we had 50

515
00:40:36.06 --> 00:40:39.72
The next group showed up so I think it was there for a couple weeks before we were a

516
00:40:40.22 --> 00:40:44.98
Complete section and then off you go so then you go to a place called the farm and here

517
00:40:44.98 --> 00:40:47.62
You say the next four weeks would be our first real challenge in basic training

518
00:40:47.62 --> 00:40:50.46
It's supposed to weed out anyone deemed unfit for the Legion

519
00:40:50.46 --> 00:40:57.82
We would be presented with our white capies only when we completed the farm and that was super foreign to me coming from the Canadian system

520
00:40:57.82 --> 00:40:58.82
I'll be a short

521
00:40:58.82 --> 00:41:02.66
You know they'd say we're you guys we go into the farm for a month. I was like you know what and

522
00:41:03.66 --> 00:41:08.18
Yeah, it was it was definitely an eye opener, but effective well what what part was an

523
00:41:08.18 --> 00:41:12.86
Was strange to you well just the term farm like I was what you know where you go farming

524
00:41:13.50 --> 00:41:17.94
Okay, and then we show up and it actually looks like a French farming building and

525
00:41:17.94 --> 00:41:24.74
Landscape around it, but it's an effective tool you're there for a month and you just get beasted on and they

526
00:41:24.74 --> 00:41:29.04
Show you the way of of the Legion Aaron if you can hack it good for you if not

527
00:41:29.74 --> 00:41:31.74
If you go how often are people quitting?

528
00:41:32.70 --> 00:41:36.58
We had a handful probably ever week one or two would dessert

529
00:41:37.78 --> 00:41:42.60
Yeah, and it was kind of as I mentioned kind of an understood thing if it's not for you

530
00:41:42.60 --> 00:41:49.50
Just or if you go if the John Darm's pick you up they would you know be sent back to the Legion they do their time in the jail and then they don't release them

531
00:41:50.22 --> 00:41:52.52
It's not like there's so any criminal I asked back to it

532
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.24
Yeah, it's just part of the system. You eat out the week and they started to build that a

533
00:41:57.80 --> 00:42:04.36
teamwork here based on this kind of thing back to the book any error collective or individual resulted in shared punishment

534
00:42:04.60 --> 00:42:09.36
We were only as good as our weakest members so those who were stronger had best help the last capable

535
00:42:09.36 --> 00:42:14.62
But those of us who were stronger and more capable soon lost patients when the guys making our days a lot harder

536
00:42:14.62 --> 00:42:19.06
It wasn't long before a clear hierarchy of ability became evident within our group

537
00:42:21.24 --> 00:42:22.84
Sayin

538
00:42:22.84 --> 00:42:30.50
The really a trying to figure out who's supposed to be there the tough routine brought the expected result

539
00:42:31.12 --> 00:42:37.40
During our first week another Britain on Australian and New Zealander from the latest group to join. We're missing at morning a pel

540
00:42:37.40 --> 00:42:43.70
Once again the realization that they had deserted struck me as odd the corpus reactions were minimal

541
00:42:44.36 --> 00:42:48.12
Ultimately no one wants a deserter in the ranks and

542
00:42:49.76 --> 00:42:55.48
Then you could get to this we were broken down into by-nomes. Did my say that right beat them be norms yeah

543
00:42:56.36 --> 00:42:58.36
or groups of two

544
00:42:58.36 --> 00:43:06.24
This is a tradition that they've come back to the Roman legions whereby two soldiers were designated to guard each other's backs and battles and in seal training

545
00:43:07.24 --> 00:43:12.96
We have swim buddies which is the same thing like in the Marine Corps and the Army I think they call them battle buddies, but yep

546
00:43:13.84 --> 00:43:19.44
So that's another word for you need a you need a you need a swim buddy you need a partner. Yep at all the time

547
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.36
You had another partner at all time and that was hunger hunger was a constant companion

548
00:43:25.36 --> 00:43:32.56
The combination of physical fitness long hours in the classroom and seemingly ended anglic endless pushups took its toll on everyone

549
00:43:33.12 --> 00:43:35.12
How much did you guys eat enough?

550
00:43:35.84 --> 00:43:39.04
We were definitely weren't eating enough to compensate for the calories you're burning

551
00:43:39.04 --> 00:43:45.04
But that was also part of it trying to turn it to the right shape and reference the the deserters

552
00:43:45.04 --> 00:43:49.56
I think I mentioned that it seemed like it was more that the brits the Kiwis the Aussies the Western area

553
00:43:49.56 --> 00:43:50.56
You know the

554
00:43:50.56 --> 00:43:54.88
Non-eastern blockers ever were deserting and I think that's because that's something

555
00:43:54.88 --> 00:43:59.000
To have you have the evidies are at home or is Eastern blockers where they're gonna go you know they got no choice

556
00:43:59.24 --> 00:44:04.88
So it's a it's an effective system, but it's not perfect because you know potentially losing good soldiers

557
00:44:04.88 --> 00:44:07.36
But they're just not ready to put up with certain bullshit

558
00:44:09.04 --> 00:44:13.44
Early on and now we get to I think what well

559
00:44:14.08 --> 00:44:18.92
Marching songs marching songs are an important legion tradition and throughout its history

560
00:44:18.92 --> 00:44:24.36
Regiments have marched into battle singing most songs tell the stories of former campaigns and battles

561
00:44:24.36 --> 00:44:26.36
Although I respected the legit legion's history

562
00:44:26.36 --> 00:44:31.92
I dislike singing as it was completely alien to my concept of what soldiering should be

563
00:44:32.36 --> 00:44:36.56
My previous exposure to army life had been an entirely different experience

564
00:44:37.52 --> 00:44:40.56
So you guys are singing he songs and here's an example

565
00:44:40.56 --> 00:44:46.24
I won't do the French version. I'll read the English being the translation against the vets against the enemy

566
00:44:46.24 --> 00:44:49.92
Wherever duty calls soldiers of France soldiers of the country

567
00:44:49.92 --> 00:44:56.68
We march toward the front Legionnaires the battle that begins places enthusiasm encourage in our souls

568
00:44:57.12 --> 00:45:00.68
It may rain grenades and gravel our victory will be sweeter

569
00:45:00.68 --> 00:45:07.72
But if death strikes us down if our bloody fingers stiffened on the ground one last raid fair well and tomorrow

570
00:45:08.04 --> 00:45:12.64
We will wish to train despite the bullets and the shells under fire and bombs

571
00:45:12.64 --> 00:45:16.92
We will advance toward the same goal ignoring the call of the grave

572
00:45:16.92 --> 00:45:24.32
Roger, no, I I should talk it, but I respect it and it has its place and its purpose and it's effective

573
00:45:24.32 --> 00:45:29.52
And that's you know, that's the history of the Legion. So it's it's what they what they do and what they use

574
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.80
They I mean this there's what do they call that there's some there's some thing

575
00:45:38.04 --> 00:45:40.52
Where you say the same thing over and over again?

576
00:45:40.52 --> 00:45:47.80
Certainly yeah, and you start to believe it. I believe it's just called straight up brainwashing

577
00:45:47.80 --> 00:45:53.04
But yeah, that's that's what they're doing right you're singing these song the cadence is that we used to sing

578
00:45:53.72 --> 00:45:56.72
We sang some cadences that were completely

579
00:45:57.80 --> 00:45:59.80
Not okay

580
00:45:59.80 --> 00:46:02.80
meaning they were just over the top with

581
00:46:02.80 --> 00:46:09.08
Just wrong and they don't do many more. It's been interesting when I went back and I talked to guys like oh

582
00:46:09.08 --> 00:46:13.76
You guys still sing that cadence kind of thinking to myself. They probably don't and they don't there's cadences that they

583
00:46:14.32 --> 00:46:16.32
Banished because they were so bad

584
00:46:17.56 --> 00:46:23.56
But they're still cadences that you sang and like things like this. Hey, this is what we do but it builds cohesion

585
00:46:23.56 --> 00:46:26.28
Right, there's the teamwork it's learning figuring it out together

586
00:46:27.36 --> 00:46:28.64
You know

587
00:46:28.64 --> 00:46:30.16
Pulling along the weakest link

588
00:46:30.16 --> 00:46:35.24
But when you do finally get it you start marching together collectively as a group there is that pride like yeah

589
00:46:35.24 --> 00:46:41.80
We nailed us and we got it and it's effective and as I mentioned we we march into the into the regiments for

590
00:46:41.80 --> 00:46:44.16
weeks later as a cohesive group in step

591
00:46:44.44 --> 00:46:50.08
Seeing them in the right tune and it's impressive that they can do that in a short amount of time with you know

592
00:46:50.08 --> 00:46:56.16
All these different nationalists and people don't speak French they have different alphabet like it's it's an effective system

593
00:46:56.16 --> 00:47:01.20
Yeah, yeah, no the the the learning French part has got a huge yeah, I'm supposed to be the Russians

594
00:47:01.20 --> 00:47:06.76
I mean they different alphabet we had Koreans. I mean I had it easy and I and I say that having that base made it

595
00:47:07.44 --> 00:47:09.000
Hell of a lot easier for me. I have to worry

596
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.18
But I could just focus on the the soldiering and the not getting beasted on how good does someone's French get in four weeks or I guess now

597
00:47:16.18 --> 00:47:17.52
It's been a week

598
00:47:17.52 --> 00:47:22.24
Weeks that they've been here depends on the individual obviously there's some that pick it up quicker than others

599
00:47:22.24 --> 00:47:26.60
If you're cleaning toilets all the time and work in the kitchen you might want to put a little more effort into it

600
00:47:26.92 --> 00:47:31.44
There's certain nationalities like the Romanian so they have that lot in base that pick it up quite well

601
00:47:32.72 --> 00:47:36.84
And yeah, it's down to each individual to put in the time and effort

602
00:47:36.96 --> 00:47:41.48
What about just fast forward real quick three years down the line does everyone food in French?

603
00:47:41.48 --> 00:47:46.60
Yeah, quicker than that. Well, that time you're done basic you have in that part of their their

604
00:47:46.60 --> 00:47:53.84
The system within those four months you have a basic level of French before you can go to the the next step to your regiments

605
00:47:53.84 --> 00:47:57.74
And that'd be said about third of the the men in the ranks are also French

606
00:47:58.28 --> 00:48:01.90
So what they'll do is imagine the book is they'll put those who speak French

607
00:48:01.90 --> 00:48:08.24
You'll be a be-in-one with a non-French speaker and you have to assist and if they're not pulled so what did they class you as?

608
00:48:08.24 --> 00:48:10.000
Yeah, I was given that so I was given

609
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.32
A couple of angle phones a Brit to help out and if they're not pulling their weight I'm cleaning toilets and working to get you with them

610
00:48:17.32 --> 00:48:23.28
So the owners is there to to get them along even with the Brit you guys have a common language because you can transfer to English

611
00:48:23.28 --> 00:48:28.32
Yeah, right, but you could be with a Korean that speaks knowing English and then yeah tough

612
00:48:28.32 --> 00:48:30.32
It's just

613
00:48:30.32 --> 00:48:36.56
When you'd be in the classroom with Sergeant Schmidt that we mentioned there are others and they would just teach you to fork fork

614
00:48:36.56 --> 00:48:42.52
Look at figure out fork if you don't you know the old open hand would come and you'd learn fork

615
00:48:43.16 --> 00:48:45.16
Fuck

616
00:48:45.16 --> 00:48:47.46
We're good to know you think it's a wrong choice

617
00:48:49.76 --> 00:48:56.82
Yeah, you say it seemed like we spent more time singing than soldering each song as songs to the tune match at the slow-paced of the Legion's March and

618
00:48:56.82 --> 00:49:01.02
In some cases secondary singers are assigned specific tenor courses filling in the background

619
00:49:01.02 --> 00:49:08.34
Most of the recruits agreed that Legion training was far from what we had expected the emphasis on singing the constant hunger

620
00:49:08.34 --> 00:49:13.62
That nodded our guts didn't help we were blissfully ignorant of the fact that this was all part of the training

621
00:49:13.86 --> 00:49:18.50
Things improved somewhat when we started concentrating on elementary combat skills

622
00:49:19.14 --> 00:49:21.38
We also started marching for several hours a night

623
00:49:22.02 --> 00:49:26.26
Compute as a complete section with our FA. How do you what do you say there?

624
00:49:26.26 --> 00:49:32.32
Famous so you say for moss from us from us from which is your weapon webbing and backpacks

625
00:49:33.94 --> 00:49:41.26
With each passing march the duration extended until we spent most of a night marching passing through local villages

626
00:49:41.26 --> 00:49:44.86
Force and fields I enjoyed the marches and didn't find them too difficult

627
00:49:44.86 --> 00:49:49.66
But some of the guys developed large blisters from the friction of our stiff stiff leather boots

628
00:49:50.10 --> 00:49:54.82
Nobody showed them much sympathy suffer in silence. That was the attitude cumulative

629
00:49:54.82 --> 00:49:58.94
Fatigue meant we were usually in a state of semi sleep

630
00:49:59.38 --> 00:50:03.34
Simply following the man in front of us. So you guys are humpin. Yeah

631
00:50:04.30 --> 00:50:08.38
How many how many clicks were you doing tonight? I can't you know, I don't to be honest

632
00:50:08.38 --> 00:50:10.38
I don't remember the exact number

633
00:50:10.38 --> 00:50:13.38
enough to it would progressively increase

634
00:50:13.62 --> 00:50:19.18
You know once we get our legs and pineus and we'll be marching on light get back early and

635
00:50:19.18 --> 00:50:25.74
The next NCOB they're saying glad you had a good night sleep. Let's get to it. Yeah, yeah

636
00:50:26.62 --> 00:50:32.64
All this trick in the gun you know we all fall for what in the Marine Corps

637
00:50:33.34 --> 00:50:36.34
Like the drone structures they change shirts

638
00:50:37.30 --> 00:50:42.10
So you never see them sweating so it doesn't matter what they're doing they'll come in like a chicken totally

639
00:50:42.10 --> 00:50:44.10
I'm sure to go

640
00:50:44.10 --> 00:50:46.10
smart

641
00:50:46.10 --> 00:50:51.46
Continue on our toes again skipping through a bunch of stuff here our time at the Foreigners finished in the final three days

642
00:50:51.46 --> 00:50:57.10
We involved the forced march meaning a march of longer duration than we had been used to it was called

643
00:50:57.62 --> 00:51:04.62
Lamaosh Kepi because it was after this that you earned the right to wear the coveted white Kepi and be promoted to the rank of Legion air

644
00:51:04.62 --> 00:51:14.70
Do zoom here. What's that yeah, yeah, I said that right. How do you send them to zoom? DGM class second class Legion error

645
00:51:17.02 --> 00:51:19.86
Then you guys are sort of in a graduation and

646
00:51:20.62 --> 00:51:24.84
Someone steps forward and reads the first line of a Legionnaires coat of honor

647
00:51:25.24 --> 00:51:29.62
Then and then the rest of you who which is where's that Benny the Scott?

648
00:51:30.06 --> 00:51:33.66
Oh, he's the guy that was that mean he used the honor gratter something. Yeah, yeah

649
00:51:33.66 --> 00:51:36.66
Eventually quit but yeah

650
00:51:37.94 --> 00:51:42.02
So you guys step forward and here's the Legionnaires code

651
00:51:43.02 --> 00:51:49.74
Legionnaire you are a volunteer serving France with honor and loyalty every Legionnaires your brother and arms

652
00:51:49.74 --> 00:51:57.54
Irrespective of his nationality race or religion you will show him the same solidarity as that which bonds a family

653
00:51:57.54 --> 00:52:04.06
Respectful of traditions loyal to your commanders discipline and camaraderie are your force

654
00:52:04.62 --> 00:52:11.50
Courage and loyalty your virtues proud of your status as a Legionnaire you express this through your uniform

655
00:52:11.50 --> 00:52:16.66
Always smart your behavior dignified but modest and your quarters always clean as

656
00:52:16.66 --> 00:52:26.78
An elite soldier you train rigorously you maintain your weapon as your most precious possession and you're always mindful of your physical condition

657
00:52:27.62 --> 00:52:33.10
The mission is sacred you will execute to the end at all costs

658
00:52:34.10 --> 00:52:40.86
In combat you act without emotion or hatred you respect the defeated enemy and you never abandon your dead

659
00:52:41.62 --> 00:52:43.62
Your wounded or your weapons

660
00:52:43.62 --> 00:52:53.10
After completing the code we are ordered to place our kepteys on our heads and the order was given to present arms to the commanding officer

661
00:52:54.10 --> 00:52:56.10
We were now Legionnaires

662
00:52:58.26 --> 00:53:03.38
Pretty awesome code there yeah, how's it's place in history?

663
00:53:06.74 --> 00:53:08.74
It's

664
00:53:08.74 --> 00:53:16.66
It's interesting they got that last line in their combat you act without emotion or hatred you respect the defeated enemy and you never abandon your dead

665
00:53:16.66 --> 00:53:22.94
You're wondering it's interesting the respecting the defeated enemy. I wonder when that was added. Do you know I don't definitely

666
00:53:22.94 --> 00:53:25.94
You're representing France the flag so your actions

667
00:53:26.90 --> 00:53:30.90
They speak for themselves. I don't know exactly historically when that was added

668
00:53:33.06 --> 00:53:35.06
Yeah, um

669
00:53:35.38 --> 00:53:37.38
So now it's time to check in

670
00:53:37.38 --> 00:53:41.70
Right check in with third company third section with

671
00:53:42.66 --> 00:53:44.66
With your regiment

672
00:53:46.98 --> 00:53:52.70
So basic continues. We basically have three months left. Oh really. Yeah, so it's yeah

673
00:53:52.70 --> 00:53:59.94
You finish the farm and then you go back to Custell for three months and then you start your training as a Legionnaire as an

674
00:54:00.18 --> 00:54:06.14
Infantryman and they basically set you up so depending on what regiment you go to you have the base skills needed for them to

675
00:54:06.14 --> 00:54:11.62
To work with you. So when you go to third company third section. Are you still in basic training? Yeah

676
00:54:12.22 --> 00:54:14.22
So you still not you still not don't yet

677
00:54:16.78 --> 00:54:18.90
What's the total training time that it's gonna take?

678
00:54:19.90 --> 00:54:22.94
Okay, I think that's yeah, that's about the same time as

679
00:54:23.46 --> 00:54:26.78
Maybe the Marine Corps boot camp Marine Corps boot camps 13 weeks

680
00:54:26.78 --> 00:54:30.78
Um

681
00:54:33.50 --> 00:54:39.98
So that and that just completes more of your kind of basic military training. Yeah, you get more into the infantry type of stuff

682
00:54:39.98 --> 00:54:42.46
Okay, so you are doing combat skills and

683
00:54:43.26 --> 00:54:48.46
The farm was just a beast to show you what would a Legionnaire should deal with and take

684
00:54:48.46 --> 00:54:56.06
There's not a lot of it's you know mentioned if there's the basics, but it's not it's just more about the discipline right learning the

685
00:54:56.70 --> 00:55:00.06
Tools of the trade and then when you get back to the the regiment for the last three months

686
00:55:00.06 --> 00:55:04.62
Then it's more focused on the soldier actually becoming the learning the tactical skills

687
00:55:04.62 --> 00:55:06.62
Yeah, and then

688
00:55:06.62 --> 00:55:10.46
You're assigned to the sports monitor course and

689
00:55:11.38 --> 00:55:13.38
The military driver course and

690
00:55:13.38 --> 00:55:20.06
And then you're gonna get sent to a second rep so we'll explain that to me. So I finished a finished first

691
00:55:20.70 --> 00:55:22.70
And hats off to I mentioned Benny he was an ex

692
00:55:24.30 --> 00:55:26.30
British soldier served in

693
00:55:26.94 --> 00:55:30.66
Over in Ireland a good guy and he was my you know go to during training

694
00:55:30.98 --> 00:55:32.34
You know he had his

695
00:55:32.34 --> 00:55:36.50
History and stories and he had a bad knee so he decided at the end of your basic training

696
00:55:36.50 --> 00:55:37.94
You can decide to

697
00:55:37.94 --> 00:55:43.46
Call a quits and he did and we had a you know I think about 17 that did I don't remember the exact figure I mentioned

698
00:55:43.46 --> 00:55:45.46
But there was a chunk that decided it wasn't for them

699
00:55:45.46 --> 00:55:48.74
I finished first and generally how it works is

700
00:55:49.14 --> 00:55:54.10
Depending on where you finish you can pick and decide where you want to go the different regiments in the Legion

701
00:55:54.10 --> 00:55:58.70
There's one airborne regiment the rep and that was my my choice my only choice

702
00:55:59.06 --> 00:56:02.98
However because I'd finished first and I had the French the language ability

703
00:56:02.98 --> 00:56:10.82
They wanted me to stay on his a foot foot now it meant it's in the book. We have these acting corpus that aren't corpus

704
00:56:10.82 --> 00:56:12.82
But they've been given that

705
00:56:12.82 --> 00:56:14.82
Greater

706
00:56:14.82 --> 00:56:16.82
ability based on their

707
00:56:16.82 --> 00:56:19.54
Language or language skills and they could be

708
00:56:20.90 --> 00:56:25.06
Fox I'd all to say that some of them took advantage of their their authority and

709
00:56:25.70 --> 00:56:28.82
Delta out punishment which was unfair because they haven't done shit

710
00:56:29.54 --> 00:56:31.54
So they had a bad name for themselves

711
00:56:31.54 --> 00:56:36.74
And we all picked up on that and we had one in particular that I had no time for and never ran into again

712
00:56:36.74 --> 00:56:43.14
Which is probably good thing but they wanted me to stay as a foot foot and I think my end head in CO

713
00:56:44.02 --> 00:56:45.22
Could tell

714
00:56:45.22 --> 00:56:49.14
Based on my reaction that wasn't I didn't want that and come all this way to be a foot foot

715
00:56:49.14 --> 00:56:53.62
I wanted to go the rep so they came up with a solution was I if I went into my sports monitor to course

716
00:56:53.62 --> 00:56:58.34
I could go to the rep what's the sports monitor course? It's basically in the regimen you'll have your sports bureau and

717
00:56:58.34 --> 00:57:04.26
And they dictate you know just the athleticism of all the Legioners they do all the planning for sports events

718
00:57:06.10 --> 00:57:08.02
Yeah, basically just run the sports bureau

719
00:57:08.02 --> 00:57:13.34
So that would be a course that gave you that qualification to be a part of the regimen sports bureau

720
00:57:13.34 --> 00:57:19.14
Got it so you're learning more about the physical training aspects so when you get to a regimen

721
00:57:19.14 --> 00:57:24.50
You can go hey, yeah, Joe you got this you know set up our physical training make sure we're good to go

722
00:57:24.50 --> 00:57:30.50
So I was able you know I had the the athleticism and I was able to you know do well enough that they I guess saw the

723
00:57:30.90 --> 00:57:37.04
That part of me as a soldier and that was the option I was given and I took it and then

724
00:57:37.68 --> 00:57:42.60
We graduated number one what's that babe that's based on just like every I think looks back that you're great

725
00:57:42.60 --> 00:57:44.60
I'm general

726
00:57:44.60 --> 00:57:49.14
Every day I just a cross the board at the end they have an evaluation what were you good at

727
00:57:49.14 --> 00:57:54.78
I could run it started to come on you know I was I was heavier when I joined you know being Canadian

728
00:57:54.78 --> 00:57:58.58
I could have had a bit of muscle on me and they they told me down pretty good

729
00:57:58.58 --> 00:58:01.58
So I picked up the running I did well and the big staple

730
00:58:04.66 --> 00:58:08.50
Physical side for the Legion is the eight kilometer run with Rucksack and weapon

731
00:58:08.78 --> 00:58:13.26
You actually do a 1500 meter sprints. There's a thing of five minute break and then you do eight kilometers

732
00:58:13.66 --> 00:58:17.82
There's that there's the rope then there's the obstacle course and

733
00:58:17.82 --> 00:58:23.66
You know, I was able to do well in those so with that on the range I was consistent

734
00:58:24.54 --> 00:58:27.26
Obviously I had the the language my kit was in gear

735
00:58:27.76 --> 00:58:31.68
You know I wasn't a problem was there anything that you were not good at anything you struggled to

736
00:58:34.18 --> 00:58:36.18
I could

737
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:42.90
But yeah, that was not my fortie but as far as the actual soldiering stuff

738
00:58:42.90 --> 00:58:44.90
There's nothing that really gave you a problem

739
00:58:44.90 --> 00:58:50.46
No, not obviously I mean I there's room for improvement in everything

740
00:58:50.46 --> 00:58:55.10
But overall no I wasn't I was enjoying it. You know I was I wanted a soldier and that's what we were doing

741
00:58:55.10 --> 00:58:59.28
I could see the the progression and where I wanted to go was was coming

742
00:58:59.28 --> 00:59:03.26
I was getting to that spot so I think I had the right attitude

743
00:59:03.26 --> 00:59:06.10
I would see like anything attitude is is a huge factor

744
00:59:06.10 --> 00:59:09.06
I think I just put my head down and soldiered on and that was

745
00:59:10.30 --> 00:59:12.30
looked up on

746
00:59:12.30 --> 00:59:16.94
Yeah, the people always surprised when you know for for seal training anyways

747
00:59:17.26 --> 00:59:21.86
You know I would say like if you're a okay high school athlete you'll be fine

748
00:59:21.86 --> 00:59:27.06
Like you don't need to be some superhuman because you just need to be able to do the stuff and then obviously

749
00:59:27.06 --> 00:59:31.34
If you got an aptitude towards running you're gonna be better that or opt to towards the obstacle course

750
00:59:31.34 --> 00:59:37.50
You're gonna be better at that but you don't need to be some super stud to make it through exactly and consistent

751
00:59:37.50 --> 00:59:43.38
It's always better than excellent one thing and then we can others like you got that you can build on those but if you're I think

752
00:59:44.78 --> 00:59:50.22
Most NCOs itself appreciate that. Yeah, you're always you're always there in that top group kind of pull on your weight

753
00:59:50.22 --> 00:59:54.50
Yeah, no for sure. I think it better to be well rounded than a special special

754
00:59:54.50 --> 00:59:57.42
special T yet swimming or a special T yet running because

755
00:59:58.22 --> 01:00:00.86
If you're not good at one of those things or if you're bad at one of those things

756
01:00:00.86 --> 01:00:04.98
You're not gonna make it because I mean it's much better to be average and I was average

757
01:00:04.98 --> 01:00:06.98
How this is strong average

758
01:00:09.86 --> 01:00:14.02
Hand-to-hand combat instructors demonstrations were full on despite his name

759
01:00:14.82 --> 01:00:19.14
Sergeant Chief LaGrosse the big was a small wide refrenchment

760
01:00:19.14 --> 01:00:24.18
He was aggressive during his demonstrations. He kicked a corporal in the groin while we all watched it all

761
01:00:24.74 --> 01:00:29.62
The sergeant chef chief then asked for the next volunteer all our hands shot up immediately

762
01:00:29.62 --> 01:00:34.58
We knew Phil for well that if we didn't volunteer we would be chosen the next guy was thrown to the ground

763
01:00:34.58 --> 01:00:39.78
Hard or something just as fun to watch so you guys were getting some actual hand-to-hand training

764
01:00:39.78 --> 01:00:43.14
Yeah, the French have that they call it court a court which is

765
01:00:43.70 --> 01:00:49.78
Somewhat based off of the these are really crev. Marga, but it's just your basic hand-to-hand and things get tight close

766
01:00:49.78 --> 01:00:52.90
Whatever you have that ability to look after yourself, but the other was a bit

767
01:00:54.42 --> 01:00:57.54
Yeah, and they'd be an invaluable you should the end and the part of this sports course

768
01:00:57.54 --> 01:01:03.70
You had to have a minimum level so you could teach it. Did you know did you remember enough judo to like make it help?

769
01:01:03.70 --> 01:01:09.30
Some of the basics, but no not really. I mean my white belt in judo wasn't really didn't impress you

770
01:01:11.30 --> 01:01:16.02
All the all the sergeant chief the big he didn't he didn't care about your judo

771
01:01:16.02 --> 01:01:18.02
No, not at all

772
01:01:20.10 --> 01:01:24.70
This is another situation you're in an older man in his family approaches from the side of the chat

773
01:01:24.70 --> 01:01:30.50
Tell we introduced ourselves and Mac explained to me that the man was with the French referred to as a peed noir

774
01:01:30.50 --> 01:01:37.14
Was that mean black foot yeah, exactly a French national born in Algeria North Africa

775
01:01:37.14 --> 01:01:44.50
This was history I knew little about aside from reading Legionnaire, but it was important in understanding the Legion and

776
01:01:44.90 --> 01:01:46.90
The second rep in particular

777
01:01:46.90 --> 01:01:48.90
Mac asked if we could go

778
01:01:49.54 --> 01:01:54.18
If we could camp on the chateau's grounds that night and the gentleman agreed that evening

779
01:01:54.18 --> 01:01:59.06
We sat around the campfire with the gentleman and his family drinking wine and listening to his stories like

780
01:01:59.06 --> 01:02:06.34
One in which he vividly described a battle where his regiment was saved by the Legion which had apparently marched into battle singing

781
01:02:06.98 --> 01:02:11.54
He was emotional telling it he had been a French officer in the Algerian war

782
01:02:12.18 --> 01:02:17.70
1954 to 1962 what I didn't fully understand at the time was that a 1961

783
01:02:17.78 --> 01:02:24.82
dissident French regiments including the legions one rep had aligned with anti-gallelists and seized power and

784
01:02:24.82 --> 01:02:32.34
Algiers during a coup d'état in part the one rep's objective was to jump into and seize Paris to remove

785
01:02:32.50 --> 01:02:37.70
President Charles de Gaulle's from power the push a German term for a coup d'état

786
01:02:38.90 --> 01:02:44.34
But used by the Legion failed before it began and the one rep was later disbanded correct

787
01:02:44.98 --> 01:02:50.10
That's a crazy step it is and prior to that the the Legion had its own

788
01:02:50.58 --> 01:02:53.38
Air Force or its own airplanes after that they were

789
01:02:53.38 --> 01:02:59.86
That control was taken away now Matt you mentioned macmonera so after my sports monitor course

790
01:02:59.86 --> 01:03:07.94
I go to back to O'Buyng which is the headquarters for the the Legion and I'm there for the summer as lifeguard

791
01:03:07.94 --> 01:03:09.94
I called that operation lifeguard

792
01:03:10.66 --> 01:03:16.34
But the promise was once I did the summer I could go to the rep macmonera was a Canadian soldier that left

793
01:03:16.90 --> 01:03:20.10
And he was actually the guy that did my B2 interview and

794
01:03:20.10 --> 01:03:25.14
And I saw him at the pool with his wife and child and I introduced myself and he kind of took me under his wing

795
01:03:25.70 --> 01:03:32.18
And during our time off we go on hikes and that's one of the hikes so we go to the shadow and the gentleman living there was an old

796
01:03:33.22 --> 01:03:40.74
French officer that had been in jail for numerous years as a result of the pooch and what happened is that P. Noah's were French citizens

797
01:03:41.06 --> 01:03:46.18
French blood that were born and raised in Algeria part of the French military, but that was their home

798
01:03:46.18 --> 01:03:54.58
And after their time in prison or France they couldn't go back to Algeria because the civil wars are over and they wouldn't necessarily welcome

799
01:03:54.58 --> 01:03:57.54
They didn't have any family or or placed to be in France

800
01:03:58.10 --> 01:04:04.18
So what a lot of them did was take over these shadows that were owned by the Algerian government and just decided

801
01:04:04.18 --> 01:04:09.54
Okay, these are our now our homes and they would live there with their families and they were you know, they didn't have the money so they're all

802
01:04:09.54 --> 01:04:16.50
Broken down old shadows, but no one wanted to take responsibility so this was an old poochist and yeah

803
01:04:16.50 --> 01:04:23.62
He told us some of his stories and this for me in widespread mention the book because it's a history lesson on on the lesion and certainly the rep now

804
01:04:23.62 --> 01:04:27.14
What was the one thing that I've and that I've

805
01:04:28.18 --> 01:04:33.62
The way I always kind of perceived that that coup d'état of the push was that

806
01:04:33.62 --> 01:04:41.94
France had decided you know what we're not gonna fight for Algeria anymore. We're gonna get it back and the legionnaires who had fought and died and

807
01:04:42.50 --> 01:04:50.02
lost their friends to to keep Algerians said you know what no we're hanging on to this exactly and by the way

808
01:04:50.02 --> 01:04:56.98
Oh, you don't want to do it fine. We're gonna literally fight a France. We're gonna do a parachute drop in the France. We're gonna take Paris

809
01:04:56.98 --> 01:04:58.10
Yep

810
01:04:58.10 --> 01:05:03.14
I'm gonna get rid of Charles to go all the president exactly 100% and there's some history from into China that

811
01:05:03.14 --> 01:05:05.14
played its part two because a lot of

812
01:05:05.14 --> 01:05:12.82
Families were left behind local national families and they paid the price and Algeria with this and a lot of them were married to Algerian women had families

813
01:05:12.82 --> 01:05:17.22
They wouldn't have the ability to bring them back to so yeah, there was a lot of history there and

814
01:05:17.62 --> 01:05:23.30
They definitely didn't agree with the Gauls decision. So and it wasn't just the rep. There was several other regiments and

815
01:05:24.26 --> 01:05:29.38
Yeah, the Gauls figured it out beforehand and got to the right people and said stand down and they did and

816
01:05:29.38 --> 01:05:35.94
Yeah, a lot of a lot of people went to a jail and there are some stories of worse, but again

817
01:05:36.34 --> 01:05:39.46
There's no yeah, it's hard to even fathom that

818
01:05:40.34 --> 01:05:46.34
It's hard to fathom that I mean it's hard to fathom that like in America right thinking that the hundred and first airborne division

819
01:05:47.30 --> 01:05:49.54
Was gonna say okay, you know what we're gonna drop

820
01:05:49.86 --> 01:05:54.26
We're gonna do a parachute drop in deadwashing in DC when it take the White House and we're gonna get rid of the president

821
01:05:54.26 --> 01:06:01.06
I mean, that's that's what that's what there is basically exactly what this is doing what we're saying here putch yeah, it's it's crazy to think that yeah

822
01:06:01.06 --> 01:06:07.22
And this was only when 1960 something yeah, this isn't like the revolutionary war

823
01:06:08.58 --> 01:06:11.86
Yeah, that's a crazy story. I'm gonna have to dive into that story on the podcast

824
01:06:12.98 --> 01:06:16.74
And that's Simon Maurice period. That's yeah, that's ongoing yeah

825
01:06:20.02 --> 01:06:22.02
All right

826
01:06:22.02 --> 01:06:25.70
How are the guys from the how would they viewed

827
01:06:27.38 --> 01:06:32.82
In other words when you when you would meet these guys that were like part of the push or when you would talk about these guys

828
01:06:32.82 --> 01:06:38.74
Would people say all they were wrong or would people say we understand? I think they understand certainly now

829
01:06:40.18 --> 01:06:45.38
With time people kind of see the reasoning and and the history and and the reason for why things occurred

830
01:06:46.34 --> 01:06:50.42
And I would also say probably at the time a lot of information wasn't being shared

831
01:06:50.42 --> 01:06:55.06
So they probably just thought they wanted to replace the goal. They didn't necessarily know the history of the reasoning

832
01:06:55.46 --> 01:06:58.90
But I think as soldiers we all certainly I I respect that

833
01:07:00.42 --> 01:07:04.82
The reason behind or what they're doing isn't really a factors more just that they were they were there

834
01:07:04.82 --> 01:07:08.26
They experienced it and I don't judge but for me it was you know

835
01:07:08.26 --> 01:07:13.70
I didn't know a lot about the religious history certainly Francis history so that was all something new to me and as I learned

836
01:07:13.70 --> 01:07:18.18
I kind of it helped me understand what I was part of and what I was joining which is important

837
01:07:18.18 --> 01:07:26.18
But but but the but as you would hear these stories it was sort of was it was it was there a level of respect when you would talk about the

838
01:07:26.50 --> 01:07:28.50
100% rap yeah, oh

839
01:07:28.50 --> 01:07:33.02
And those were the pictures that I'd seen and then it's like a beauty's and stuff was them jumping into China

840
01:07:33.18 --> 01:07:39.54
Jim M. Fu and then Algeria during the war and that is what became the maps turned into

841
01:07:39.86 --> 01:07:42.74
What the rap is today oh 100% I thought it was cool is

842
01:07:43.70 --> 01:07:45.78
And they disbanded completely one rap

843
01:07:45.78 --> 01:07:49.46
They gone forever yeah like that history is dead. They were yeah

844
01:07:49.46 --> 01:07:54.02
They said no, it's not done. I mean, it's actually kind of crazy that they kept the anything

845
01:07:54.74 --> 01:07:57.54
I mean he can't him can you imagine the gall he must have said

846
01:07:58.10 --> 01:08:03.78
That's I mean he must have I guess they must have done a good job of isolating saying no that was these guys over here

847
01:08:03.78 --> 01:08:05.78
You can keep the rest of that's work cool

848
01:08:05.78 --> 01:08:06.78
Definitely

849
01:08:06.78 --> 01:08:13.78
Yeah, because if I was him I'd be thinking way to second these guys are a unified and they were kidded up waiting at the airport

850
01:08:13.78 --> 01:08:18.82
The planes didn't show up that's he got to the Air Force General and said stand down. I know what's yeah

851
01:08:18.82 --> 01:08:20.98
There were there were close. Who'd have been exciting?

852
01:08:21.78 --> 01:08:26.26
But yeah, yeah, it's industry in part of history for sure. No, and I talked about a lot

853
01:08:27.22 --> 01:08:32.90
To be honest with you. Yeah, it's a lot of stuff there that I learned being there and being surrounded by and asking questions

854
01:08:32.90 --> 01:08:38.58
But yeah, and I'm sure I'll go into at some point in Legion air, but that warred Algeria was vicious

855
01:08:38.58 --> 01:08:40.58
Yep, and it was a

856
01:08:40.58 --> 01:08:45.14
True like counter-insurgency going on and there was a lot of you know, there was there was

857
01:08:46.18 --> 01:08:50.30
The insertion tactics of you know booby traps and I

858
01:08:50.30 --> 01:08:55.38
E.Ds and things like that it was brutal. Yeah, it was brutal great movie about it too

859
01:08:55.70 --> 01:09:01.30
That's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's interesting. I worked in Algeria for years after the military and

860
01:09:01.94 --> 01:09:07.38
Again, you know, just seeing some of the spots he talked about when I ever camp was right next to his camp in Philivillin

861
01:09:07.38 --> 01:09:14.42
Yeah, for me history is is something I'm always fascinated with so it's interesting to see in here and then be in spots and

862
01:09:15.38 --> 01:09:18.90
Put them all together a little battle field walk. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry

863
01:09:20.18 --> 01:09:26.74
All right back to the book here my summer pass quickly enough even though and I was given three weeks and told that I could return

864
01:09:27.70 --> 01:09:30.50
On my return I would be departing for the parachute regiment

865
01:09:31.70 --> 01:09:35.70
Home wasn't quite what I expected because you went you ended up going home seeing family was great

866
01:09:35.70 --> 01:09:39.06
Ultimately things changed with time and people move on Janelle

867
01:09:39.94 --> 01:09:47.62
Which was the the female you were involved with had a new boyfriend? Yeah, as they do and my friends were either working or going to school

868
01:09:47.62 --> 01:09:53.30
Not a lot of common interest for experiences trying to explain how it's meant the last year was difficult if not pointless really

869
01:09:53.94 --> 01:10:00.78
People just didn't get it my time at home only reinforced my original goal to jump from a military airplane

870
01:10:00.78 --> 01:10:06.30
Yeah, so it was like a reset you miss home as you know me that at that point had been well over a year

871
01:10:07.26 --> 01:10:10.70
But you go home and it's the same shit. There's a reason why you left

872
01:10:11.50 --> 01:10:16.78
I hadn't achieved obviously what I'd gone there to do so that check wasn't in the box

873
01:10:17.34 --> 01:10:22.54
But it kind of gave me that reset new vigor and off I went yeah, and you know

874
01:10:23.34 --> 01:10:26.22
Yeah, it should happen best thing ever. Yeah, see you later

875
01:10:26.22 --> 01:10:29.82
Now have fun with it a Fred over there exactly

876
01:10:33.02 --> 01:10:35.82
You saw the GCP for the first time

877
01:10:36.70 --> 01:10:44.38
So yeah, I joined the the airborne regiment do you imagine my co-shape power cheese which are not even trying based on the island of Corsca and

878
01:10:44.78 --> 01:10:49.18
Calvary which is a Mediterranean island off the coast of texture closer to Italy, but it's part of France

879
01:10:49.34 --> 01:10:54.96
So I joined the rep. I do my my jump course to about three weeks and I joined the first company

880
01:10:54.96 --> 01:10:56.96
Which specializes in night

881
01:10:57.76 --> 01:10:59.76
ops urban combat and

882
01:11:00.96 --> 01:11:04.72
You know every week you're typically every week here. You're jumping and we're at the

883
01:11:05.04 --> 01:11:10.98
The airport getting kidded up this truck pulls up and all these guys jump out and it's a mix of corpile sergeants

884
01:11:11.28 --> 01:11:15.04
senior NCOs and a lieutenant in a captain and they're the

885
01:11:15.76 --> 01:11:21.68
Covalency of the pathfinders and the British or Canadian system in the French system. They're considered

886
01:11:22.88 --> 01:11:24.88
Pathfinders for the regiment

887
01:11:24.88 --> 01:11:30.72
But in the French military there's nine airborne regiments in total one of them is the legions rep

888
01:11:30.96 --> 01:11:32.96
So they're part of the battalion each

889
01:11:33.84 --> 01:11:37.76
Regiment has a GCP team and they create the GCP group

890
01:11:38.16 --> 01:11:43.84
So they can work together and support the French special operations command so they can either be working for the regiment as Pathfinders or

891
01:11:45.04 --> 01:11:47.04
Separately as the group supporting

892
01:11:47.76 --> 01:11:51.52
French special operations man so I didn't obviously know this at the time I see them jump out

893
01:11:51.52 --> 01:11:56.16
They seem more relaxed like the Legion way it's certainly the rep and a common company. It's very

894
01:11:56.72 --> 01:11:57.92
You know

895
01:11:57.92 --> 01:12:03.84
These guys jump out slack, you know kind of they got their jumpsuits on they grabbed the rigs and they're just kind of hanging out and

896
01:12:03.84 --> 01:12:05.60
It seemed to me that the

897
01:12:06.24 --> 01:12:09.92
NCOs y'all officers in the junior ranks were all kind of mingling which doesn't happen

898
01:12:10.56 --> 01:12:17.68
Typically or ever in a combat company and so I asked our corpile, you know who is who is that and he said the other was the GCP

899
01:12:17.68 --> 01:12:20.24
So that was the first time I saw something like something

900
01:12:20.24 --> 01:12:24.16
I didn't know about but I was like damn that that looks like I need to get some if I can

901
01:12:25.60 --> 01:12:27.60
Yeah, that's what happens

902
01:12:28.96 --> 01:12:31.84
So you get done with that jump school I presented myself to

903
01:12:32.16 --> 01:12:35.44
Now you're back. I think this is where you're checking into your duties your section

904
01:12:35.44 --> 01:12:42.000
I present myself to the first section duty NCO in the section hallway and the court and the duty corporal corporal rake

905
01:12:42.56 --> 01:12:45.76
Who is formerly in the British Parisian Regiment correct yep?

906
01:12:45.76 --> 01:12:48.000
So I've just joined the first company done basic training

907
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.96
We're all going to the first company. This is me showing up mr. rookie with beer case in hand

908
01:12:52.96 --> 01:12:57.36
He provided me with some quick advice total line war card

909
01:12:57.84 --> 01:13:01.52
This simple insight into section life was pretty much the norm for all Legionnaires

910
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:03.84
There was no room for discussion

911
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.16
Yeah, so we have to show up with a case of coronavirus

912
01:13:06.32 --> 01:13:09.80
Which they sell at the fact that the Legion is stake owner in

913
01:13:10.24 --> 01:13:16.96
Coroner but that's you gotta show up with your case of beer and hand it over if you don't you'll just be going straight back to get your beer

914
01:13:16.96 --> 01:13:21.04
So we all know this way. Yeah, that's and rake yeah, rake was good shit

915
01:13:22.08 --> 01:13:28.16
Yeah, yeah, work hard. Yeah pretty straightforward really good advice shut up and just do your tool

916
01:13:28.16 --> 01:13:30.16
That's really good advice for all of life

917
01:13:31.76 --> 01:13:34.88
Life in the company didn't differ much from basic training

918
01:13:34.88 --> 01:13:42.16
A pelvis done at section in company levels in the company Parade squares and section hallways in the mornings the company would parade at

919
01:13:42.16 --> 01:13:49.12
0 720 hours section duty corpus would present to duty section sergeant who would present the section head NCOs who in turn

920
01:13:49.12 --> 01:13:51.52
Represent the section commanding officer usually lieutenant

921
01:13:52.32 --> 01:13:55.32
So you guys are still rigid. Oh

922
01:13:55.68 --> 01:13:57.68
Yeah, it's

923
01:13:57.84 --> 01:14:03.76
Yeah, I mean because checking into a seal team like those days are like even I was a new guy checking into a

924
01:14:03.76 --> 01:14:07.44
Skelton we're not report anything like that. Yes. Well at this point. I mean it's it's

925
01:14:07.44 --> 01:14:13.92
Infantry it's a year typical army regiment. It's just regiment yeah controlled and then

926
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:17.60
Yeah, making sure that their legion hairs don't do dumb things

927
01:14:18.24 --> 01:14:22.88
That's I'm the living in barracks 100% yeah, there's the regiment there open bay barracks

928
01:14:23.76 --> 01:14:28.16
Meaning do you have your own room or like for to a rumour saw there was or it was six

929
01:14:28.16 --> 01:14:32.88
No, it wasn't yeah wasn't time but yeah, I could you bring females back on base? No

930
01:14:32.88 --> 01:14:36.96
Good one no no no

931
01:14:37.68 --> 01:14:42.32
So we wish you could hotel rooms on the weekends when you get well we get you get into if you want to go out

932
01:14:42.32 --> 01:14:43.92
You have to go through a

933
01:14:44.08 --> 01:14:49.68
Procedure where you apply for peri me shown so every day in the morning if you want to go at the end of the day if you're allowed

934
01:14:50.80 --> 01:14:55.20
You fill out a form and it's a little square piece of paper you got to use a ruler to write it straight

935
01:14:55.20 --> 01:14:58.56
If not though this rip it up in front of you you hand that to your corpel

936
01:14:58.56 --> 01:15:04.24
And that goes to your sergeant then it goes to the lieutenant if you approve he signs it it goes to the captain

937
01:15:04.24 --> 01:15:08.56
He signs it and it comes back and then at the end of the day when the workday is over

938
01:15:08.96 --> 01:15:14.72
They give you your tea to peri me shown you have to get you're gonna form on because as a legion error for the first five years

939
01:15:14.72 --> 01:15:16.72
You can't wear a civis so you're in uniform

940
01:15:17.36 --> 01:15:20.24
So you get on a uniform you go down to the

941
01:15:21.52 --> 01:15:28.000
The NCO on duty in your company and he'll check your tea to peri me show he'll check your uniform to make sure that it's square to wait

942
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.04
I don't want to go out all right. Yeah, I'm done you know, and then if he says it's good

943
01:15:33.04 --> 01:15:36.24
Then you go to the front gate and the duty in CO and sergeant there do the same thing

944
01:15:36.24 --> 01:15:38.24
They look at you and then when you're in town

945
01:15:38.48 --> 01:15:40.96
There's the military police that are patrolling and

946
01:15:42.16 --> 01:15:46.24
If they they catch you out of sorts or you know, it's jail

947
01:15:46.72 --> 01:15:50.96
So yeah, it's seriously controlled now as we said you know, it's things have lightened up a bit now

948
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:52.32
But during the time it's yeah

949
01:15:52.32 --> 01:15:57.04
You didn't want to go for that so we can sure but my first deployment in the seal teams

950
01:15:57.04 --> 01:15:59.92
I deployed and what we used to call a spec ops

951
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:04.08
Bulltune which sounds a lot cooler than it actually was just meant that we were deployed we deployed the Guam

952
01:16:05.12 --> 01:16:07.12
And so when we get there, I mean I'm

953
01:16:07.76 --> 01:16:09.76
Twenty or twenty one years old and

954
01:16:10.24 --> 01:16:14.80
It was pretty much like hey you do your job and then do whatever you want

955
01:16:15.04 --> 01:16:19.60
Which in Guam meant we were gonna go me were young male human beings

956
01:16:19.60 --> 01:16:25.92
We were gonna go and get after it and and if you if you had to meet at a to clock the next morning

957
01:16:25.92 --> 01:16:29.36
You could show back up you could leave at as soon as the work was done

958
01:16:29.52 --> 01:16:34.000
You could go do whatever you wanted as long as it was borderline legal

959
01:16:34.40 --> 01:16:39.76
And then when you got done you could if you were meeting at eight o'clock in the morning you come roll back in at seven fifty nine

960
01:16:40.48 --> 01:16:43.20
And no one cared what you did it was total

961
01:16:43.60 --> 01:16:49.04
Mayhem it was total mayhem and then was it was interesting my next deployment I went on board a ship

962
01:16:49.92 --> 01:16:51.92
With a seal puttune and

963
01:16:51.92 --> 01:16:55.12
If you were an e4 below which I was

964
01:16:56.16 --> 01:16:58.16
You had to be back on the ship by

965
01:16:58.64 --> 01:17:03.44
It was either nine or ten o'clock at night. So when he took your right in your yeah, that isn't it

966
01:17:03.44 --> 01:17:08.08
It was but but it was it was like completely crazy to me that

967
01:17:08.64 --> 01:17:15.92
a year prior I had been literally doing whatever I could imagine doing for and by the way

968
01:17:15.92 --> 01:17:21.60
Wasn't like you know we'd have entire weekends or we'd get a three day or a four day weekend and just go

969
01:17:21.60 --> 01:17:28.64
Do I mean just get crazy just go and just do whatever you want and then here I was a

970
01:17:29.44 --> 01:17:33.28
Year later now I'm like 22 or 23 years old and they're saying

971
01:17:33.92 --> 01:17:38.08
Well, this is with my work up and deployment. That's why it's fast forwarding 18 months two years

972
01:17:38.08 --> 01:17:42.80
But it now all of a sudden. Hey, you know you gotta be back by by 10 o'clock in night

973
01:17:42.96 --> 01:17:44.96
I mean I was in Thailand

974
01:17:45.84 --> 01:17:49.68
On rogue solo missions in the middle of nowhere

975
01:17:49.68 --> 01:17:55.04
You know and then fast forward. I'm on a ship and they're like hey, you're gonna be back by 10 o'clock and it was great

976
01:17:55.04 --> 01:17:59.36
It was seem crazy to me and that's why you know earlier you and I were talking about

977
01:18:00.16 --> 01:18:06.56
Like when you join the military and how much how much how it is for you mentally and just to have

978
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:11.44
Experience the kind of freedom that I experienced early on and then get that tightened back up was a lot harder

979
01:18:11.44 --> 01:18:15.92
That's what I think when you're 18 years old like I was when I joined the military

980
01:18:15.92 --> 01:18:22.24
I wasn't fully I didn't fully understand freedom anyways. Yeah, so it was like okay cool

981
01:18:22.24 --> 01:18:28.48
You want me to do whatever you want me to fill out 19 forms before I can go have a beer with a female out in town

982
01:18:28.48 --> 01:18:32.40
Cool bring me the forms. I'll do it. Yeah, no, it's it's and I you know

983
01:18:32.40 --> 01:18:37.28
That's why I tried to get into that when I mentioned because as we say you know where young men you join

984
01:18:37.28 --> 01:18:40.40
There's certain things that you don't necessarily think about when you go there like oh, you know

985
01:18:40.40 --> 01:18:44.56
I want to join Legion be a soldier, but you're young men you got other objectives to at the end of the day

986
01:18:44.56 --> 01:18:48.16
And it's not the greatest environment for other objectives

987
01:18:48.48 --> 01:18:51.12
Which is a result of probably the high turnover?

988
01:18:51.12 --> 01:18:56.88
You know when you do me to girl you're like come back going back to that and that's why they they lost a lot of guys

989
01:18:57.44 --> 01:19:01.28
That's as I said that's changed, but I try to get that into the book to show that

990
01:19:01.52 --> 01:19:04.64
There's other aspects of the mental game that are there. It's you know

991
01:19:05.04 --> 01:19:07.68
Sure pushups are getting beasted on and whatever, but there's also

992
01:19:08.16 --> 01:19:13.20
There's other parts to a human being and it's tough sometimes to to deal or get get to that

993
01:19:13.20 --> 01:19:17.92
You know, so that's the the idea behind some of the now as you get stuff

994
01:19:17.92 --> 01:19:22.80
That's your first five years you can't go out without your uniform on garrison

995
01:19:22.80 --> 01:19:27.60
No, now if you're on leave and you get a three week leap period you can go off theoretically. You can't leave France

996
01:19:28.24 --> 01:19:30.80
How much do you get a year typically about three weeks

997
01:19:31.76 --> 01:19:33.76
Yeah

998
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:34.80
It's the life

999
01:19:34.80 --> 01:19:38.08
Yeah, now if you go on operation you'll get the dish. I think you're guaranteed three weeks

1000
01:19:38.08 --> 01:19:42.72
But if you go over overseas on tour when you come back you'll get another three so it depends if if you're busy

1001
01:19:42.72 --> 01:19:49.36
You get you know more, but yeah, it's not that's not their objective is to give you leave it still

1002
01:19:50.08 --> 01:19:52.08
to use your services

1003
01:19:52.64 --> 01:19:54.64
Oh

1004
01:19:55.36 --> 01:19:56.64
Then

1005
01:19:56.64 --> 01:20:01.60
That's a challenge of writing telling the stories. I got it you got to cover all the things that people don't think about so it's

1006
01:20:02.16 --> 01:20:03.68
You know, it's figuring out yeah

1007
01:20:03.68 --> 01:20:05.84
Well, what's interesting is I always tell people hey, you know

1008
01:20:06.48 --> 01:20:08.88
Look the military is not like boot camp

1009
01:20:08.88 --> 01:20:14.16
Meaning hey when you get done with boot camp which yeah boot camp is you're gonna be all regimenting all that

1010
01:20:14.88 --> 01:20:17.44
But I would say you know military's not really like boot camp

1011
01:20:17.44 --> 01:20:24.16
Well, that's also coming from my perspective as a seal which really is not very much like boot camp at all when you get to a seal team

1012
01:20:24.72 --> 01:20:30.24
But and then you get to you know the regular navy or the regular army or the the Marine Corps

1013
01:20:30.24 --> 01:20:37.12
There's more aspects to it that are more similar to boot camp like you got to fill out a chip to go to

1014
01:20:37.12 --> 01:20:42.16
To go on liberty or something like that, but this is leaning towards boot camp

1015
01:20:42.16 --> 01:20:46.88
I mean this is like you know this is definitely then like a range of regiment range of regiment

1016
01:20:46.88 --> 01:20:52.64
They're they're freaking hard core too and they you know you're still dropping down doing pushups for people when you're

1017
01:20:53.52 --> 01:20:58.64
At range of Italian whereas in the suit teams like people don't drop you down to do pushups

1018
01:20:58.72 --> 01:20:59.92
There's no

1019
01:20:59.92 --> 01:21:05.12
Punishment like that. I mean you can get in trouble, but your trouble is just gonna be no like a normal

1020
01:21:05.12 --> 01:21:07.12
Uh

1021
01:21:06.80 --> 01:21:10.96
Like you get written up or something like that if you do something really agree just but you got to do something pretty

1022
01:21:10.96 --> 01:21:14.24
You're just to get written up. I don't think I ever got written up

1023
01:21:14.24 --> 01:21:19.04
Then that's the environment here, right? Is I when I get to the GCP which is considered as it's a team thing

1024
01:21:19.04 --> 01:21:22.24
And the onus is on you to you got to you got to show up if you don't show up

1025
01:21:22.24 --> 01:21:26.56
Only you get you get kicked out of the team and that's not quite as yeah, that's part of it

1026
01:21:26.56 --> 01:21:31.76
too is is even it's this another thing that comes to a big surprise for people is during seal training

1027
01:21:31.76 --> 01:21:38.72
There's a majority of the weekends you have the weekends off yeah, like you can once again if you want to do

1028
01:21:38.96 --> 01:21:44.48
You could go like when I went through guys some guys will go down to Mexico go down to Tijuana and party the whole weekend long

1029
01:21:44.48 --> 01:21:50.32
And come now I wouldn't do that a because I was like younger and be because I was paranoid about not making it through

1030
01:21:50.32 --> 01:21:54.000
So I would sit there and sharpen my knife all weekend long and polish my boots and and

1031
01:21:54.56 --> 01:21:58.56
Press my uniforms because I was super paranoid about not making it

1032
01:21:58.56 --> 01:22:05.20
But some guys they just they would be gone the whole weekend and there's here's the deal some guys would get in trouble

1033
01:22:05.20 --> 01:22:07.20
And then they wouldn't make it to the seal too

1034
01:22:07.20 --> 01:22:11.92
So there was a test of your maturity and of your own personal discipline

1035
01:22:12.32 --> 01:22:15.36
Whether you could make that Monday morning 0 4 30

1036
01:22:16.08 --> 01:22:23.04
Times run on the beach. Hey if you're late. That's it you fail you're out or you spend the weekend doing something stupid

1037
01:22:23.04 --> 01:22:29.28
You can't perform you're out or you suck it up and you stay there and you polish your boots and you get ready for Monday

1038
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:31.12
Which is what you really should be doing though

1039
01:22:31.60 --> 01:22:36.96
But yeah that that the the the individual freedom that you get in seal training is a test

1040
01:22:37.36 --> 01:22:41.60
It's a test to see if you can handle it or not because once you get to a seal team and you're in a seal

1041
01:22:41.60 --> 01:22:46.80
Ptune you you got all kinds of freedom it's kind of crazy when when you think about it

1042
01:22:46.80 --> 01:22:50.80
You've got all kinds of freedom you're in a foreign country. You've got all you've got money

1043
01:22:50.80 --> 01:22:55.44
You've got you know access to gear and if you do you if you wanted to be stupid

1044
01:22:55.84 --> 01:22:58.40
You could get really stupid really quick and you could cause some real problems

1045
01:22:58.40 --> 01:23:01.44
Yeah testosterone has its effects 100% yeah

1046
01:23:01.84 --> 01:23:05.68
Yeah, but these guys are keeping you all tight

1047
01:23:07.04 --> 01:23:09.04
Yeah, yeah

1048
01:23:10.16 --> 01:23:16.24
And that's and that's the system you know as you mentioned obviously your the seal system is effective and that's the way it is it we do

1049
01:23:16.24 --> 01:23:23.44
So the Legion system has that history where they probably initially had the type of people where you had to be

1050
01:23:23.44 --> 01:23:25.44
Right them all the time

1051
01:23:25.44 --> 01:23:30.08
And that's it's where it is and that's you know as I mentioned they're kind of lighting up on

1052
01:23:30.08 --> 01:23:34.24
And now the things have changed and they're busy. Yeah, they don't have to be quite as stringent on the guys because of the turnover

1053
01:23:34.24 --> 01:23:40.08
But yeah, it's it's definitely controlled and that's something you got to keep in mind if you're gonna go there like it's not

1054
01:23:41.28 --> 01:23:45.20
Yeah, yeah, there's that person you get that idea of iron discipline

1055
01:23:45.20 --> 01:23:50.32
And you when you go back in history and I've talked about this before well one of the reasons that you needed

1056
01:23:50.32 --> 01:23:55.60
Iron discipline back in the days you're literally dealing with conscripts that don't have what want to be there at all

1057
01:23:55.60 --> 01:23:58.56
Yeah, like you've taken them there basically slaves are gonna fight for you

1058
01:23:58.56 --> 01:24:03.92
So you have to impose some kind of discipline now you can also find many examples where past leaders

1059
01:24:04.72 --> 01:24:08.56
That were even leading conscripts but they led that they cared about their men

1060
01:24:08.56 --> 01:24:11.28
It was more positive it was a better outcome

1061
01:24:11.28 --> 01:24:17.20
But unless you're that care is magic leader that can pull that off well you're left with one choice and it's like okay

1062
01:24:17.20 --> 01:24:20.32
I'm gonna these guys are good either doing I tell them and I'm gonna beat them

1063
01:24:20.32 --> 01:24:24.64
I'm gonna lead with fear. Yeah, it's always better to leave with caring for your guys

1064
01:24:24.72 --> 01:24:28.32
But when people don't have that capability what do they do they they

1065
01:24:29.20 --> 01:24:33.68
Default to I'm just gonna lead by fear or if it's things you if you give them that

1066
01:24:34.56 --> 01:24:39.04
Latitude or options are a rule I make they come back and yeah, yeah

1067
01:24:39.04 --> 01:24:43.76
Like yeah, then you drop the hammer again. It don't allow to do anything and I think in the system too

1068
01:24:43.76 --> 01:24:50.80
You see the NCOs as you rise in rank your freedoms increase so then the onus is on you to get there

1069
01:24:51.68 --> 01:24:55.60
And obviously that's what the delisence like you for just you know these NCOs and leaders

1070
01:24:55.60 --> 01:24:58.88
So they're hard either in the beginning but there's a reason for that if you want to get to the top

1071
01:24:58.88 --> 01:25:03.92
Well, then put it in time and have for tell us show us that you're capable and you'll get those those freedoms

1072
01:25:03.92 --> 01:25:08.64
Yeah, and what about like they like you mentioned earlier that the less of the Eastern block

1073
01:25:08.64 --> 01:25:12.48
Guys would deserve because they're just used to a harsher lifestyle

1074
01:25:13.04 --> 01:25:18.24
It seems like if I was an Eastern block guy and now I'm getting I think you say the pay is like

1075
01:25:18.80 --> 01:25:21.76
1200 bucks and a lot of something like that. Yeah good money. Yeah. I'm sitting here

1076
01:25:21.76 --> 01:25:26.64
Oh, you want me to fill out a thing cool off a lot of thing all day long. I don't care. Yeah, and that a big part of the

1077
01:25:27.44 --> 01:25:32.56
The size of the wrapper a lot of leisure regiments during that phase where Eastern block

1078
01:25:32.96 --> 01:25:34.24
Pollax and

1079
01:25:34.24 --> 01:25:39.52
Remanians checks slabs everything um they they took up a big part of the rank and

1080
01:25:40.64 --> 01:25:42.64
Yeah exactly as you say

1081
01:25:42.64 --> 01:25:48.24
It was a good a good option for them considering the the time man. I had a guy from a dairy farm in Minnesota

1082
01:25:49.84 --> 01:25:54.48
Well, this kid was this kid was basically slave labor growing up. Yeah. He told me literally

1083
01:25:54.48 --> 01:25:58.96
I will do whatever you want me to do as long as it doesn't have to do with cows and he was right

1084
01:25:59.60 --> 01:26:03.12
He hated cows but he would do he was this hard worker

1085
01:26:03.12 --> 01:26:06.64
Yeah, like he would have lived this lifestyle like it was a joke

1086
01:26:06.64 --> 01:26:09.84
He was ready 100% because he grew up just harsh

1087
01:26:10.48 --> 01:26:15.76
But if you grew up kind of pampered by a little bit rough 100% yeah, and that's the thing too if he's some walks

1088
01:26:15.76 --> 01:26:18.48
I think they grew up hard so there was some tough tough guys

1089
01:26:18.48 --> 01:26:23.76
I he got some Polish corporals and some of the comic companies. They're yeah, he don't fuck around excuse my friends

1090
01:26:24.16 --> 01:26:26.64
Yeah, and they have the freedom to ruin your day. You know

1091
01:26:27.28 --> 01:26:32.08
So yeah, you learn that pretty quick. Yeah, I had a Polish national awesome guy named drog always I did a

1092
01:26:32.08 --> 01:26:34.08
Patent him and he's just

1093
01:26:34.48 --> 01:26:39.92
So legit, but he's the same way like oh, what do you all do he was doing man? He won't have a big it happened

1094
01:26:41.60 --> 01:26:43.60
So yeah, there we go. All right

1095
01:26:44.40 --> 01:26:46.40
You end up doing some cool stuff though

1096
01:26:47.20 --> 01:26:49.04
Here's part of it and over the next three weeks

1097
01:26:49.04 --> 01:26:55.20
We learn how to both tell a mark and downhill ski with winter survival and alpine battle drills culminating in a final exercise with live fire

1098
01:26:56.16 --> 01:27:01.52
Our French instructors who were oversized white berets got to work introducing us to tell a

1099
01:27:01.52 --> 01:27:06.56
Marks king in the forest around surrounding the forts you're doing some winter warfare training good

1100
01:27:07.52 --> 01:27:14.32
Since I could already ski everything came easily enough to me, but one day I made the soldiers mistake a serious one while inside my shelter after patrol

1101
01:27:14.32 --> 01:27:16.56
I'd remove the magazine from my farmhouse

1102
01:27:17.92 --> 01:27:24.24
But I forgot to clear it and check prior to releasing its action and bang an accidental discharge

1103
01:27:24.24 --> 01:27:27.20
AD albeit with a blank round regardless

1104
01:27:27.52 --> 01:27:29.12
Lieutenant de

1105
01:27:29.12 --> 01:27:34.96
Mesme wasn't impressed I explained my mistake and he gave me the look of parental disappointment to my surprise nothing more

1106
01:27:34.96 --> 01:27:36.96
We're set about the incident

1107
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:43.28
Yeah, you had that mighty AD I did less and learned and I always remember because Benny during basic training

1108
01:27:43.28 --> 01:27:47.92
It told me where one of his buddies had been shot in his lying his bed after patrol and

1109
01:27:49.04 --> 01:27:54.000
Ireland one of the teams came back and the guy had an Indian basically shot his friend through the head and it stuck with me

1110
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.40
And I was you know a story that sunk and so when I had that in the effa man fuck

1111
01:27:58.40 --> 01:28:05.04
I just you know didn't do the same thing but that's exactly how it happens and at that point I had been pulling my weight

1112
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.36
Having the

1113
01:28:07.36 --> 01:28:14.56
Being blessed and braises a you know an officers son whatever in Europe we were skiing in the Alps every winter so I could I was good skier

1114
01:28:15.12 --> 01:28:17.12
And so I was pulling my weight

1115
01:28:17.60 --> 01:28:18.88
Not causing

1116
01:28:18.88 --> 01:28:24.000
Demesme any problems so at that part I think he could tell that I was I was hard enough on myself

1117
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.60
He didn't really say much what he can say

1118
01:28:25.60 --> 01:28:31.52
But yeah, it was it was definitely a good lesson for me 100% and every time after that when I you know took my

1119
01:28:32.48 --> 01:28:37.28
My agof I'm thing right away fucking clear like I just son of can that's that's how you learn right?

1120
01:28:37.28 --> 01:28:39.60
Yeah, yeah

1121
01:28:39.60 --> 01:28:41.60
Clear your weapon. Yep. Young

1122
01:28:41.60 --> 01:28:43.60
Thanks, yeah, I'm troopers out there

1123
01:28:43.84 --> 01:28:46.64
Don't have the AD it's really bad

1124
01:28:49.04 --> 01:28:51.68
Here's another situation where you you you tried to

1125
01:28:51.68 --> 01:28:56.64
You try to get to like a to leave to ski early and

1126
01:28:57.28 --> 01:28:59.76
Some NCO stomped you and then

1127
01:29:00.24 --> 01:29:04.56
We go here this guy so now you can't leave to go skiing early you've got to go with everyone else

1128
01:29:04.56 --> 01:29:05.76
He kind of

1129
01:29:05.76 --> 01:29:09.28
Crossed your plans and you say back in our barracks room

1130
01:29:09.28 --> 01:29:15.76
It was I was mid complaint about this rude disruption to my life when the NCO walk past within your shot

1131
01:29:16.08 --> 01:29:21.12
He marched into our barracks room and I paid for my belly aching with a head butt to the mouth

1132
01:29:21.12 --> 01:29:28.64
Not a word was said and we actually automatically brought up my guard to which the NCO responded by grabbing a metal stool from the corner

1133
01:29:28.64 --> 01:29:31.76
Strongly suggesting I don't bother taking it any further

1134
01:29:32.72 --> 01:29:34.08
check

1135
01:29:34.08 --> 01:29:40.000
So my fault I burrow myself I was trying to leave early. There was a bus scheduled for everyone to leave it

1136
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.48
I think it was two or something and I had this great idea

1137
01:29:42.48 --> 01:29:49.52
You know that I was gonna go out at skip lunch and just go out and yeah, he put a kai Bosch to that and walk by the hall when I was

1138
01:29:49.52 --> 01:29:51.52
Bictionable to my other

1139
01:29:51.68 --> 01:29:54.40
Friends and yeah, came up and just basically

1140
01:29:54.88 --> 01:29:59.44
You know it's quite a bit bigger of a hats off to let me just butt to the mouth which shocked me

1141
01:29:59.44 --> 01:30:03.24
My initial reaction was just you know guard right like or and yeah

1142
01:30:03.24 --> 01:30:06.60
That's what he looked to the side and took that you know that was all

1143
01:30:07.10 --> 01:30:11.000
1940s French army stools you know it's a metal the way they just took that news

1144
01:30:11.60 --> 01:30:12.96
Like yeah, I'm good

1145
01:30:12.96 --> 01:30:14.96
I'm understood

1146
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:18.96
And that was just like no factor. That's his day in the life. Yeah, who knows

1147
01:30:18.96 --> 01:30:25.68
Maybe he had it for me. I don't know. I don't recall but yeah, he checked my my attitude noted

1148
01:30:26.88 --> 01:30:31.68
All right back in Calvary, we squared away our kit and went straight back into the company routine and entry

1149
01:30:32.08 --> 01:30:38.000
Level company sniper course reschedule now is informed I was one of the two Legionnaires chosen from our section to attend

1150
01:30:38.32 --> 01:30:42.08
Joining nine other Legionnaires and corpus so you go to sniper school

1151
01:30:43.04 --> 01:30:45.04
You learn about the sniper weapon weapons

1152
01:30:46.08 --> 01:30:48.08
Then you also do

1153
01:30:48.08 --> 01:30:53.76
Everything else that we do which is sniping infiltrating building observation posts shooting from them

1154
01:30:54.44 --> 01:31:02.88
Technical training crawling into our OP is looking down range designated for archifier. This is standard. Yeah, it was technically the first phase of sniper qualification

1155
01:31:02.88 --> 01:31:04.40
It was tiered elite so it was more

1156
01:31:04.96 --> 01:31:08.000
Learning it was more of the shooting side of things the basics

1157
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.40
But you would fall up on that and go to the actual sniper course after so it was a second part of the the qualification

1158
01:31:13.40 --> 01:31:16.96
So it's split into and yeah, that was the first part

1159
01:31:16.96 --> 01:31:18.96
Then

1160
01:31:18.96 --> 01:31:25.52
You continue on with section training and you say here section training continued for nearly ten months during which I knocked thirty six jumps

1161
01:31:26.88 --> 01:31:33.20
Soldier well all-jrow and physically and you're left alone by the corpus NCOs and officers this wasn't overly complicated

1162
01:31:33.60 --> 01:31:40.72
One morning during a run our head NCO said that in light of my general performance. I should consider volunteering for the GCP selection process

1163
01:31:40.72 --> 01:31:42.72
I wasn't aware that one could just volunteer

1164
01:31:42.72 --> 01:31:47.04
But I took his advice and passed before we tended dis mesme

1165
01:31:48.24 --> 01:31:54.72
Demesme correct him and asked for his approval to volunteer for GCP pre-selection which he doly approved

1166
01:31:55.68 --> 01:31:57.68
Cool you're getting that going

1167
01:31:58.96 --> 01:32:00.08
Corporal

1168
01:32:00.08 --> 01:32:06.32
Nogasi Nagisa Nagisa Nagisa Nagisa Nagisa Nagisa Nagisa Nagisa Nagisa was our duty corporal that week

1169
01:32:06.56 --> 01:32:11.52
This is just another story turn transfer in fast forwarding. He was Japanese and his French was less than stellar

1170
01:32:11.52 --> 01:32:14.88
I approached him in the hallway and asked why I was supposed to be cleaning toilets

1171
01:32:15.68 --> 01:32:20.32
This is again a little fast forward jump. He took exception to me questioning his directive

1172
01:32:20.88 --> 01:32:24.72
And after a short back and forth he gave me a push saying that's an order

1173
01:32:25.68 --> 01:32:31.68
Nagisa was shorter than me, but stocky. I was pissed off of being told the clean toilets after ten ten months in the section

1174
01:32:31.84 --> 01:32:35.36
Fuck that I thought this push pissed me off too and

1175
01:32:35.36 --> 01:32:41.44
Unwritten rule exists within the lower ranks that in a confrontation that per that's perhaps more personal

1176
01:32:41.76 --> 01:32:46.48
You can suggest the higher rank higher rank remove his rank which I did

1177
01:32:47.12 --> 01:32:53.52
Nagisa removed his rank and pushed me again this time harder. I responded with a left to the side of his face

1178
01:32:53.76 --> 01:32:59.60
He dropped to the floor and then curled up into the fetal position holding his right cheek. I immediately felt bad and concerned

1179
01:32:59.92 --> 01:33:02.56
What had just happened was a huge mistake on my part

1180
01:33:02.56 --> 01:33:06.88
Roger that and then you fast forward you see him kind of all

1181
01:33:07.12 --> 01:33:15.12
Bandaged up and you say Nagisa wasn't a bad guy really my emotions had gotten the better of me and over something that wasn't a big deal at all

1182
01:33:15.44 --> 01:33:23.28
The captain was right who did I think I was this is the type of thing that had got me into trouble before the Legion and I needed to stop making these kind of stupid mistakes

1183
01:33:25.12 --> 01:33:28.32
So there you go. Yeah another good lesson learn

1184
01:33:28.32 --> 01:33:34.88
Man, I wish these lesson learns lesson learned lessons learned that you put in this book about just growing up

1185
01:33:35.60 --> 01:33:40.16
I wish there was some way that a young man could actually heed these warnings

1186
01:33:40.56 --> 01:33:44.64
Well, they could buy the book. Yeah, definitely you can buy the book and I hope they do

1187
01:33:45.36 --> 01:33:50.56
But you know like any my defensive I may you know I'm not a a psychopath. I'm not just punching people

1188
01:33:50.56 --> 01:33:52.56
There was some history there and

1189
01:33:52.96 --> 01:33:56.72
New Legionnaires joined the the section every week or second week

1190
01:33:56.72 --> 01:34:02.88
So we had ample new guys that would be cleaning to us that was I could tell that why did he make you do his person?

1191
01:34:02.88 --> 01:34:10.88
I was probably who knows? I don't recall but he obviously had an issue with me and that's what I noted and then so when I questioned it

1192
01:34:11.36 --> 01:34:17.28
Typically his his response was clearly you know pushments in order. I could tell that it's it's personal and then yeah

1193
01:34:17.28 --> 01:34:19.76
The rest is history, but yeah, I certainly regret it and

1194
01:34:21.28 --> 01:34:24.72
Yeah, and the captain it was actually the the company captain that

1195
01:34:24.72 --> 01:34:31.44
It's good to me like who the fuck do you think you are but saving grace was and and the corporal

1196
01:34:32.16 --> 01:34:38.000
Had the same story he agreed that we'd go through if you're ranks or he had room in his rank so I was you know typically not at fault

1197
01:34:38.40 --> 01:34:41.68
But still my attitude was in question. What do you think made you?

1198
01:34:42.88 --> 01:34:46.000
How do you think you were able to self reflect and actually see that you were wrong?

1199
01:34:46.80 --> 01:34:54.24
I mean because I hear this story over and over and over again from people that they can't they can't put the ego aside and just say you know what

1200
01:34:54.24 --> 01:34:57.84
That I was actually a jackass here. Yeah, he was at the end of the day. He was the corporal

1201
01:34:58.16 --> 01:35:00.88
He put on the orders that I cleaned 12 so he just cleaned 12s

1202
01:35:01.60 --> 01:35:04.000
Who am I to question his orders that's his role?

1203
01:35:05.60 --> 01:35:11.12
When I'm in a corporal I can you know choose and decide what I want to do but and that situation he was the

1204
01:35:11.84 --> 01:35:13.20
the higher ranking

1205
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:17.68
Junior rank and yeah, I was wrong to question it and I was certainly wrong to

1206
01:35:18.24 --> 01:35:20.24
to go beyond that and

1207
01:35:20.24 --> 01:35:23.12
And the idea would be like if that's in an

1208
01:35:23.68 --> 01:35:28.48
Operation or things going on you don't question orders and that's you know the idea for ranks and orders is

1209
01:35:29.12 --> 01:35:32.96
You told do something you do it. There's no room for questioning that just gets people killed

1210
01:35:33.92 --> 01:35:38.16
So I was you know as a red flag for me as a character thing. I certainly as a

1211
01:35:39.04 --> 01:35:46.96
You know an up and coming soldier within the regiment is you don't it's just there's a wrong choice at the end of the day and I regretted it and I could tell right away and that was just old

1212
01:35:46.96 --> 01:35:48.96
Muscle

1213
01:35:49.84 --> 01:35:51.84
Memory you know what I mean

1214
01:35:51.84 --> 01:35:55.44
problem and that's I think that's that's one thing that

1215
01:35:56.32 --> 01:35:58.48
You know I mean I talk about all time on here is like

1216
01:35:59.92 --> 01:36:07.12
Well you actually do question orders and you do say hey boss why are we doing it this way and a good leader says oh well

1217
01:36:07.12 --> 01:36:09.12
What do you think why do you think that?

1218
01:36:10.16 --> 01:36:13.36
And there's a time in a place for that. No, but with this one

1219
01:36:13.36 --> 01:36:17.92
This is a classic example you don't have a relationship with this guy at all

1220
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
He doesn't like you for whatever reason and

1221
01:36:21.28 --> 01:36:26.40
Instead of trying to build that relationship which would eventually because what if you're on an Operation and this guy

1222
01:36:26.40 --> 01:36:31.68
You're working for this guy and he makes a bad decision and says hey charge that machine gun nests and you're like okay

1223
01:36:31.68 --> 01:36:34.16
And now you all get killed because you charge machine gun nests

1224
01:36:34.40 --> 01:36:37.04
We want to have a relationship to a point where I can say hey

1225
01:36:37.04 --> 01:36:41.92
Hey, Nogison we need to we need to flank this guy or we need to get better coverfire something as

1226
01:36:41.92 --> 01:36:45.60
As opposed to hey Roger that. I'm gonna do what you told me to do

1227
01:36:46.16 --> 01:36:49.84
If you if you had no relationship with him even in a combat situation

1228
01:36:49.84 --> 01:36:53.04
He tells you do something and you say that's not a good call. He says shut up and go do it

1229
01:36:53.28 --> 01:36:56.24
Like now we're in a really bad standoff situation

1230
01:36:56.24 --> 01:37:01.28
You're disobeying a direct order in a combat situation. This is horrible. Yeah, whereas

1231
01:37:01.76 --> 01:37:05.68
If you do these little things like hey you want me to clean the cuz he's

1232
01:37:06.16 --> 01:37:10.72
What when it would he's really doing his testing you right whatever reason he didn't like you you are a good skier

1233
01:37:10.72 --> 01:37:14.48
And he struggled skiing or whatever and he's jealous and he's like oh, yeah, you probably

1234
01:37:14.48 --> 01:37:18.80
You probably skit you grew up skiing the French Alps and I grew up whatever

1235
01:37:19.68 --> 01:37:25.60
Not doing that and so he's jealous of that and so now he wants to get a gots opportunity to put it on you

1236
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:30.64
And if you're character if you can show him that your characters hey Roger that boss got it. I'll clean those toilets

1237
01:37:30.64 --> 01:37:37.20
Hey, yep, don't worry about it. You keep you. I'm humble. I'm good. I know I can ski good, but I can also clean toilets good. Watch this

1238
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:40.08
Then you start to build that up where you can eventually say

1239
01:37:41.60 --> 01:37:48.24
Now now he probably will look at you and his respect for you goes up. Yeah, cuz he says oh he grew up kind of a rich kid

1240
01:37:48.80 --> 01:37:54.16
skiing the Alps, but he doesn't mind cleaning toilets a not a bad guy and then you can eventually build that into someone

1241
01:37:54.16 --> 01:37:59.76
You can communicate with where does this doesn't turn out that way? No exactly and the sun they've been said about

1242
01:38:00.08 --> 01:38:04.64
peacetime army or time army is there's those different ways of

1243
01:38:04.64 --> 01:38:09.28
Figuring out who's who's what and where they should be in the hierarchy things and

1244
01:38:10.24 --> 01:38:14.72
Yeah, as I said we I don't know what and I could say was made of he didn't know what I was necessary made of

1245
01:38:15.20 --> 01:38:18.96
But in that situation, I I'd pull my weight for the duration that was there and

1246
01:38:19.68 --> 01:38:26.08
Yeah, they came to that and result wrong choice, but you learn from it and you move on and that was the last time I

1247
01:38:26.72 --> 01:38:31.44
Made that type of error and it's a classic. It's classic ego scenario, right? This is a class

1248
01:38:31.44 --> 01:38:37.76
You show scenario and and there's some there's a there right now. I guarantee there's a 20 year old listening to this

1249
01:38:38.72 --> 01:38:43.68
Go in what are you talking about man that guy's gonna make me clean toilets. I'm gonna bow up to him

1250
01:38:43.68 --> 01:38:50.24
And it's like that guy in five years that guy's gonna. Oh, yeah, I remember thinking that because you have to just mature through this

1251
01:38:50.24 --> 01:38:56.40
That's why I'm saying hey, I'm glad guys are gonna read this book, but you have to really read it and think about it

1252
01:38:56.88 --> 01:39:00.24
You have to really try and think about it think about what you're saying

1253
01:39:00.24 --> 01:39:02.24
Because man we are genetically programmed

1254
01:39:03.44 --> 01:39:07.68
You're a certain way and that certain way is not always the best way

1255
01:39:07.68 --> 01:39:12.08
That no exactly and so it's a name I mean the French foreign Legion there's obviously a reason

1256
01:39:12.56 --> 01:39:19.36
That I've gotten there and life maybe some of my choices weren't the wise as so I need to start learning and you know

1257
01:39:19.68 --> 01:39:25.28
Using this to my advantage not making the same mistakes all the time did you have like you said it was a captain that pulled you son

1258
01:39:25.28 --> 01:39:27.28
tattoo. Do you think you are did you have anyone that was like hey, man?

1259
01:39:27.28 --> 01:39:33.12
Hey man, what are you doing? Well a lot of potential why are you doing this? I had to trust uniform

1260
01:39:33.44 --> 01:39:38.80
Way-to-side. He called me and I go and present myself and then he basically you know ask me what occurred

1261
01:39:39.52 --> 01:39:44.56
At the end of that all the corpus came to me while I was cleaning toilets and said if you do that again

1262
01:39:45.12 --> 01:39:46.08
You know

1263
01:39:46.08 --> 01:39:51.52
You'll pay the price so it was made quite clear that you know question corpus in the in the section fair enough

1264
01:39:52.72 --> 01:39:55.12
And I cleaned those toilets so you know and results

1265
01:39:55.12 --> 01:39:57.76
And I didn't win I just yeah and I jeopardized my

1266
01:39:58.32 --> 01:40:04.08
Potentially my chance to do selection for the GCP so I was on all levels down on myself. Yeah, and you just said

1267
01:40:04.48 --> 01:40:09.84
You said you just said I didn't win which is which is like you're not gonna win that situation

1268
01:40:10.72 --> 01:40:15.28
And that takes a that takes a little bit of insight to understand hey you can stand up

1269
01:40:15.28 --> 01:40:20.000
You can bow up you can act like a tough guy you could even beat the shit out of him, right? You could have knocked him out

1270
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.16
And you're still gonna lose yeah you're still gonna be cleaning toilets for longer with with a reduction in rank and

1271
01:40:26.40 --> 01:40:30.72
Proposably prison time which that's another thing we yet we you mentioned a couple of times

1272
01:40:30.72 --> 01:40:33.36
But you guys get sent to jail you do yeah

1273
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.20
It doesn't you utilize you said it doesn't happen much. No, it doesn't take much. Oh, it doesn't take much. Yeah, I was lucky

1274
01:40:39.92 --> 01:40:43.12
I you know I told the line pretty good and I'm surprised I didn't go to jail there

1275
01:40:43.36 --> 01:40:46.08
But again the fact that he took his rank off was my saving grace

1276
01:40:46.08 --> 01:40:49.20
But yeah if you do anything that's deemed unacceptable

1277
01:40:49.20 --> 01:40:54.24
There's different amount of days and give you but they have a prison in the regiment and you're basically used as a

1278
01:40:54.88 --> 01:40:59.36
Ground's keep so you'll do an eight kilometer on every morning the shave your head you're in combat

1279
01:40:59.92 --> 01:41:06.08
With your typical HSE vest and you're basically running around cleaning up the camp and you do that for a week two

1280
01:41:06.08 --> 01:41:12.56
Eats depending on your hands and it doesn't take much right like missing like year yeah if you go out for the night with your teeth and you're late

1281
01:41:13.36 --> 01:41:16.32
We can seven days. Yeah, it's a jail. Yeah

1282
01:41:16.32 --> 01:41:21.92
You know the navy does that the navy has the navy can put you on bread and water

1283
01:41:22.40 --> 01:41:24.08
Like it niss like right now

1284
01:41:24.40 --> 01:41:28.32
There's some probably someone right now that's on bread and water for yeah, so doing something

1285
01:41:28.32 --> 01:41:33.92
And there's guys out see that we're always in jail. I remember things to myself like why do you come all this way jointly and then spend your time at jail

1286
01:41:33.92 --> 01:41:35.68
Like it just I mean like repeat a fact

1287
01:41:35.68 --> 01:41:38.64
Yeah, just always saying guys here run by you know as like cheese then

1288
01:41:39.20 --> 01:41:42.80
Those are the people that are not introspective. They're not learning unless exactly

1289
01:41:42.80 --> 01:41:46.24
Yeah, check all right

1290
01:41:47.28 --> 01:41:52.48
Next you go to pretty selection is this pre selection for GCP yeah correct yeah, so now it's pre selection

1291
01:41:52.48 --> 01:41:57.20
starts off you're doing weapons assembly you're working with all the different weapons

1292
01:42:00.56 --> 01:42:07.12
Humps 30 collect humps. Yeah, so that's the big one. You got to do a 30k run with rucksack gear helmet

1293
01:42:07.92 --> 01:42:09.92
and yeah

1294
01:42:09.92 --> 01:42:18.24
And this is still just GCP selection. Yeah, correct. So each combat company in the regiment there's five now when I was there there's four

1295
01:42:18.80 --> 01:42:23.44
But based on your performance within the section you can request

1296
01:42:24.08 --> 01:42:28.16
Selection if you're lieutenant approves and then your captain approves

1297
01:42:28.96 --> 01:42:31.84
Then you you can go and do selection and they'll they'll get a you know

1298
01:42:31.84 --> 01:42:39.20
30 I guys and then the GCP is looking for two new recruits or two new operator whatever they'll they'll take what they need based on if it's you know

1299
01:42:39.84 --> 01:42:45.28
Medics they need radio comms whatever they'll they'll pick and choose but you're there based on your performance

1300
01:42:45.28 --> 01:42:47.28
So it's not it's on an open selection. It's

1301
01:42:47.92 --> 01:42:55.36
You pulled you eight and you're you've requested selection. So and did you have a specialty at this point like you just mentioned comms medic no I had

1302
01:42:55.36 --> 01:43:01.84
Obviously it was first company so we were urban combat night and I had my you know the first part of the sniper course

1303
01:43:02.72 --> 01:43:07.52
That was it and you drive her call right. Yeah, so kind of milling is that is that not a big deal

1304
01:43:07.52 --> 01:43:13.44
No, it's just basic driving qualification I had my sports modern course, which doesn't you know help, but it shows that there's a bit of

1305
01:43:14.40 --> 01:43:16.40
Got

1306
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:19.44
Yeah, but they take the the pre selection phase to

1307
01:43:19.44 --> 01:43:26.80
To put you through the the test and then figure out you know what what you're made of and then they'll

1308
01:43:27.60 --> 01:43:32.64
You will join the team on training and the CFE have the the character and the personality to gel with the other guys

1309
01:43:32.96 --> 01:43:35.04
So it's they're not really questioning your ability

1310
01:43:35.20 --> 01:43:39.52
There is the the physical aspect where they make you do the entry tests and all kind of stuff to see who's the better

1311
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.40
But a lot of times the guys that were better at the push-ups the rope and all kind of stuff on the range

1312
01:43:44.40 --> 01:43:46.40
They would not quite pull their weight

1313
01:43:46.40 --> 01:43:51.60
So it was again being consistent across the mark and then when you start training with the teams

1314
01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:00.32
They pick up on you know whether or not you're able to pick up on the the lessons are teaching you and then if you gel with the other guys and that's kind of I think

1315
01:44:00.32 --> 01:44:01.68
They're

1316
01:44:01.68 --> 01:44:07.36
There's a lot of you mentioned that quite a few times in the book and I know I've highlighted somewhere, but just this idea of like hey

1317
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.60
Just because you can run fast just because you can do the 30 click hump

1318
01:44:11.60 --> 01:44:18.56
With the required time or even the fastest of the bunch doesn't necessarily mean we want you on this team because

1319
01:44:18.72 --> 01:44:23.36
The most important thing is how do you interact with these other human beings that you're gonna put your lives in the hand of

1320
01:44:23.36 --> 01:44:24.32
Yeah, agreed

1321
01:44:24.32 --> 01:44:26.32
What the logic are you 30 kilometers together?

1322
01:44:26.72 --> 01:44:28.72
If you're there first one doesn't really help the last guy

1323
01:44:29.28 --> 01:44:31.28
You know, but it shows you're

1324
01:44:31.28 --> 01:44:35.44
You're willingness and you got something mental thing to 30 kids at the end you're yeah, you're slogging along

1325
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.68
It says something but it's not everything just shows something but it's not everything

1326
01:44:39.68 --> 01:44:41.12
Yeah

1327
01:44:41.12 --> 01:44:48.64
Yeah, there's some guys that make it through basic seal training who are total studs but they're kind of our duds as seals because

1328
01:44:49.36 --> 01:44:54.24
They just couldn't work well with other people or they were to get in trouble and you know

1329
01:44:54.24 --> 01:44:57.84
I had had a guy that was great got great athlete and a good enough guy

1330
01:44:57.84 --> 01:45:01.36
But he just like getting in trouble. It's like the guy that you guys that you said you seem going to jail

1331
01:45:01.68 --> 01:45:03.68
Over and you're like man

1332
01:45:03.68 --> 01:45:08.16
Just don't do that stuff, man. You got all kinds of potential, but I don't know

1333
01:45:08.16 --> 01:45:14.80
I guess that's you mentioned testosterone earlier and I guess that can be hard to reign in some people. They're hard to change

1334
01:45:14.80 --> 01:45:17.12
So yeah, they just they do what they do

1335
01:45:18.80 --> 01:45:21.84
Yes, they do so you passed the GCP class

1336
01:45:23.20 --> 01:45:25.20
I do yeah, I get in

1337
01:45:25.60 --> 01:45:29.84
And they send me off to do my you have to minimum rank in the team is corporal

1338
01:45:30.72 --> 01:45:35.44
So they they actually pull me off of the the selection early and I thought I was getting

1339
01:45:35.44 --> 01:45:40.24
The good news is and yeah, you're not getting acts. Yeah, but they were acts. Yeah, there. Yeah

1340
01:45:40.24 --> 01:45:43.84
They're sending me off the corporate school. So I was starting so how long was the corporal's course? I think it was a month

1341
01:45:44.32 --> 01:45:47.92
For Maria four weeks and this is now where we started getting a little bit of leadership training

1342
01:45:49.44 --> 01:45:54.000
Yeah, more beasting how to really more beasting and how to be st others

1343
01:45:54.56 --> 01:45:55.76
There's a bit of leadership

1344
01:45:55.76 --> 01:45:59.36
There's you know giving orders drill that kind of stuff, but yeah, so you go back to

1345
01:45:59.84 --> 01:46:02.80
Castell which is the training wrench for four weeks and

1346
01:46:02.80 --> 01:46:07.28
And yeah, they're in the the trade is a corporal, but it's yeah, it's heavy on the

1347
01:46:07.76 --> 01:46:12.40
The beasting and the singing unfortunately which I get into but our training until

1348
01:46:13.84 --> 01:46:15.36
Was a lunatic

1349
01:46:15.36 --> 01:46:18.08
Qualified and good at what he did what's the name in the book?

1350
01:46:19.12 --> 01:46:22.32
It was muggy rai Ra he had he had done the command of course and

1351
01:46:24.88 --> 01:46:26.88
Down in South America

1352
01:46:26.88 --> 01:46:30.16
Man I forget the name, but it's renowned as a tough command of course

1353
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:34.80
Um, man house ever heard is it what country is it?

1354
01:46:35.20 --> 01:46:41.68
I think it's in the Brazil yeah, yeah, anyway, you know, I think I think serge did that yeah, it's

1355
01:46:42.24 --> 01:46:45.44
There's a prisoner war phase where a lot of guys just lose it

1356
01:46:45.84 --> 01:46:50.16
Yeah, I think I came those you know feet and I'm your cage is in the water. You know with the rats swimming around

1357
01:46:50.16 --> 01:46:54.64
But still anyway, some of the guys it's renowned for its effectiveness, but he had done that

1358
01:46:54.64 --> 01:46:59.68
Yeah, I think it's serge did that why serge went my buddy serge who's a black-bonged jetser and he's

1359
01:47:00.40 --> 01:47:04.88
He he went through one of those courses it might have been the Rangers school though, but anyways he went through one of the

1360
01:47:05.60 --> 01:47:09.64
Renownly hard courses and he's a he's a man

1361
01:47:09.64 --> 01:47:10.64
I can't do it

1362
01:47:10.64 --> 01:47:14.28
He you know, he was probably in the prisoner of war sections like enjoying

1363
01:47:15.92 --> 01:47:19.36
Exactly, but I think my deriore was never had never less the left the course

1364
01:47:19.36 --> 01:47:21.68
He was there we were just part of his course

1365
01:47:21.68 --> 01:47:23.68
Yeah

1366
01:47:23.68 --> 01:47:28.48
He's effective he was you know he's he was a character in hence and that was just for your corporal score. Yeah, yeah good times

1367
01:47:29.68 --> 01:47:35.20
Now you're now you're joining the GCP finally and here we go. I presented myself to the duty office and I was told

1368
01:47:36.80 --> 01:47:42.32
I was going to the Central African Republic or car tomorrow to join the section

1369
01:47:43.20 --> 01:47:46.40
Bangui is that right? Bungi. Yeah, Bungi, Central Africa

1370
01:47:46.40 --> 01:47:52.60
The country's capital wasn't turmoil after a military rebellion so this is

1371
01:47:53.28 --> 01:47:56.88
Uncoming back from course course. They're already there. I'm not part of the team

1372
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.20
Next thing would be my command of course, and then my halo course before you're an actual team member in the GCP

1373
01:48:03.44 --> 01:48:06.36
So this was surprised because they're asking me to go to join them

1374
01:48:06.36 --> 01:48:10.000
So it's unusual, but it's a good opportunity, but I'm not a team member yet

1375
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.28
What made them they just needed? Yeah, they're short a person yeah correct

1376
01:48:13.28 --> 01:48:15.28
Yeah

1377
01:48:15.28 --> 01:48:18.28
So on November 20, my scene was your senior exemplary

1378
01:48:20.28 --> 01:48:28.12
On November 21st, 1996 I joined a dozen legionaires and NCOs from the second CIE who are on their way to

1379
01:48:28.64 --> 01:48:30.64
Chad now you get

1380
01:48:31.28 --> 01:48:32.64
Captained Raoul

1381
01:48:32.64 --> 01:48:36.40
Yep, Captain Raoul pulled me aside and told me that I wasn't a qualified

1382
01:48:37.04 --> 01:48:41.80
Section member yet. I was to watch and learn from the others. He quit then quickly brief me on the situation

1383
01:48:41.80 --> 01:48:44.88
The army of car elected president

1384
01:48:45.48 --> 01:48:47.48
Patas

1385
01:48:47.48 --> 01:48:49.48
was divided

1386
01:48:50.12 --> 01:48:53.000
And the rebels who opposed him had taken the

1387
01:48:53.56 --> 01:49:01.08
Patevo district on the southwestern edge of the city the rebels consisted of army officers as well as soldiers who were well-armed and capable

1388
01:49:01.24 --> 01:49:04.92
What I didn't know is that the conflict wasn't new to the rebels and

1389
01:49:06.44 --> 01:49:08.84
There were undesirables within the mix

1390
01:49:08.84 --> 01:49:15.32
Locals were being robbed and raped and there were rumors of summary executions

1391
01:49:16.84 --> 01:49:20.64
So this is it you're you just went from yeah from

1392
01:49:21.60 --> 01:49:28.56
Castell to Bungi and with and within a week and never really done any operation yet

1393
01:49:28.56 --> 01:49:32.28
No, you've had you deployed out of France you know at this point no, this is your first to point

1394
01:49:32.28 --> 01:49:38.32
Yeah, this is good one thrown right in there. Good way to kick it off. Yeah, and here's your first operation as we approach the X-Patriot neighborhood

1395
01:49:38.32 --> 01:49:43.56
There were shot where shots had been reported my new teammates clicked off there for moss safety's

1396
01:49:43.56 --> 01:49:45.04
I did the same

1397
01:49:45.04 --> 01:49:51.72
This was my first time with a live weapon outside of a supervised shoot the VLRA rolled to a stop, which is your vehicle

1398
01:49:51.72 --> 01:49:55.80
We jumped out and started searching the neighborhoods main road and smaller joining alleyways

1399
01:49:55.80 --> 01:50:01.32
I was partnered with Lasco and followed his lead as we as I walked down the road weapon at the ready locals

1400
01:50:01.32 --> 01:50:06.40
Gleared at me a ran away with nothing to see we got back in the VLRA and made our way to

1401
01:50:06.40 --> 01:50:08.40
PK zero, which is the road

1402
01:50:08.92 --> 01:50:16.76
This wide avenue was lined with large irrigation ditches and a mix of fields and homes all of which were either abandoned or derelict

1403
01:50:16.76 --> 01:50:21.76
Everything seemed eerily quiet to me. We returned to camp debriefed and I got into my sleeping bag

1404
01:50:21.76 --> 01:50:26.56
As I lay there I reveled in my new surroundings before falling asleep Africa was clearly new

1405
01:50:26.88 --> 01:50:31.76
But also no one was barking orders at me and there was no a pal or parade in the morning

1406
01:50:31.76 --> 01:50:34.76
The only requirement was to be ready for 0 900

1407
01:50:34.76 --> 01:50:40.52
So that's your first real mission that you rolled out on a very nice culture shock. Yeah, it's just cut off

1408
01:50:41.20 --> 01:50:44.68
Yeah, more just head on a swivel like what you know everything's new

1409
01:50:44.68 --> 01:50:52.000
But it's nice break in mission. Yeah, great. It was simple and it's like you go out nothing happens you get some of those

1410
01:50:53.12 --> 01:50:58.88
Gators first mission, Gators and the guys don't worry either that well. They might have seen me during the pre selection

1411
01:50:58.88 --> 01:51:01.44
But as a person they don't really they don't know me so I'm

1412
01:51:01.44 --> 01:51:05.36
Call it the center of that fact is I'm the new guy

1413
01:51:05.36 --> 01:51:10.28
You got to try not to stick out not doing anything dumb and just yeah, that was my focus

1414
01:51:10.28 --> 01:51:16.000
And then trying to keep up with what was happening because they had been there a while so at that point they you know had some some contacts and stuff

1415
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.60
So they were in the game and I'm just not obviously

1416
01:51:20.96 --> 01:51:25.60
Yeah, this is this is something again. I was as I've reading this book. I was like and we're gonna go into this more

1417
01:51:25.60 --> 01:51:31.20
But just these when I think about what it feels like like

1418
01:51:31.20 --> 01:51:35.68
Even this first time you rolled out. I remember the first time I rolled out in Baghdad

1419
01:51:36.48 --> 01:51:40.92
It was luckily was the same type of operation. We went out nothing happened rolled back

1420
01:51:41.20 --> 01:51:44.20
but even just the the

1421
01:51:47.20 --> 01:51:52.24
The amount of vision that I had the amount of awareness that I had wasn't as good as it should have been

1422
01:51:52.24 --> 01:51:56.12
You know, I was like a little bit too amped up and it's like okay, how can

1423
01:51:56.12 --> 01:52:01.84
Talking about that hopefully guys can take a step back and be like all right cool look. This is what's going on

1424
01:52:02.48 --> 01:52:09.46
You know here's what it's gonna be and that's what you want but it's hard it's hard to it's hard to train even train for that

1425
01:52:09.46 --> 01:52:14.12
I mean you gotta do it. Yeah, you gotta do it. You gotta do it and that click

1426
01:52:14.28 --> 01:52:20.48
It's a whole different boom. Now you're at a different it's no more fun in games. You know theoretically it's it's a life-on-on

1427
01:52:20.48 --> 01:52:22.48
It's all right

1428
01:52:22.48 --> 01:52:24.48
all right

1429
01:52:24.48 --> 01:52:31.52
Going on you get another tasking and undisclosed number of rebels. We're pillaging the home of a high-ranking car official

1430
01:52:32.28 --> 01:52:38.96
We approach the target slowly and deliberately and S.U.V. was parked outside a white colonial house frame by large trees and thick elephant grass

1431
01:52:38.96 --> 01:52:42.96
We could see movement on the inside of the residents over the radio capping row

1432
01:52:42.96 --> 01:52:48.52
We'll order two leads approach the target more closely while the rest of us formed a defensive semi circle

1433
01:52:48.56 --> 01:52:53.32
The stillness of the night was quickly shattered by a burst of AK-47 fire at close range

1434
01:52:53.32 --> 01:52:59.68
It certainly had my undivided attention the first rounds landed out at the feet of our two teammates approaching the target last going

1435
01:53:00.28 --> 01:53:03.24
Corporal chief pre-gen a French Tahitian

1436
01:53:03.62 --> 01:53:08.52
They immediately returned fire trace around to cut through the darkness and some hit the ground and trees surrounding us

1437
01:53:08.52 --> 01:53:12.92
Instinctively those of us within with line of sight with the rebels returned fire

1438
01:53:13.16 --> 01:53:18.42
But it was difficult to tell exactly where the rounds were coming from and who is who cease fire capping

1439
01:53:18.42 --> 01:53:25.02
Rouls shouted we were told to secure our perimeter. This is my first firefight. I kept my focus despite the chaotic atmosphere

1440
01:53:25.18 --> 01:53:27.78
Where everyone was trying to gauge the situation?

1441
01:53:27.78 --> 01:53:33.58
Do as they were told and look out for the bad guy the house was cleared and its external floodlights were turned on

1442
01:53:33.94 --> 01:53:37.22
Unfortunately our night vision then became useless this

1443
01:53:37.46 --> 01:53:43.62
Intern did wonders for my natural night vision although I could see this surrounding wooded area my eyesight was off

1444
01:53:43.62 --> 01:53:49.82
Everything was out of focus kneeling over kneeling by a tree for cover with my from us shoulder

1445
01:53:50.34 --> 01:53:56.26
At the ready watching my arc I caught slight movement within my peripheral vision the motion came from a dark area

1446
01:53:56.26 --> 01:54:01.76
Within the taller trees. What is it my blood was racing from the intensity of firefight and my eyes were still adjusting?

1447
01:54:01.98 --> 01:54:07.02
What was what I saw actually anything looking over the barrel of my weapon?

1448
01:54:07.02 --> 01:54:13.30
I stood up and took three steps toward a more pronounced treeline the only sound was the faint crunch of

1449
01:54:13.30 --> 01:54:17.46
Dead grass under foot and my heart beats steadily pumping in my ears

1450
01:54:17.46 --> 01:54:22.38
Then I saw it again a movement near a tree now was clear to me the silhouette of a man was crouching

1451
01:54:23.22 --> 01:54:29.58
Taking up the slack on the trigger as I made my approach my concern was too fold was this a rebel or a teammate

1452
01:54:29.82 --> 01:54:35.74
If he was a rebel and I opened fire that would be my teammates response or what would be my teammates response?

1453
01:54:35.74 --> 01:54:38.74
This close to my arc of fire. I approached

1454
01:54:38.74 --> 01:54:44.14
As I approached it became obvious that the silhouette was a rebel bent over his weapon with his head down

1455
01:54:44.62 --> 01:54:51.06
At this range approximately three meters. I knew I had the upper hand this all unfolded within a minute or two of our initial

1456
01:54:51.06 --> 01:54:57.90
Contact with the rebels all of which had been chaotic. I approached the rebel from the side at a faster pace pointing my weapon as midsection

1457
01:54:58.42 --> 01:55:01.42
And spitting out the words bush paw don't move

1458
01:55:01.42 --> 01:55:09.18
Most central African speak some French and he twitched his head slightly to the side as if to acknowledge my presence and the command

1459
01:55:09.34 --> 01:55:13.02
He seems stiff and afraid to move keeping my eyes and

1460
01:55:13.34 --> 01:55:15.66
From us pointed at the rebel I

1461
01:55:16.22 --> 01:55:18.82
Shouted to Captain Rauble asking him to come to my position

1462
01:55:18.82 --> 01:55:25.000
He was visibly shocked to see that I had captured a rebel Captain Rauble immediately kicked the A447 from the rebel script

1463
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.88
Grabbed the man by his arm and threw him to the ground and kicked him in the back of his head driving his face hardened to the dirt

1464
01:55:30.88 --> 01:55:36.02
We secured his arms and legs using tie straps attached to my webbing the rebel wearing his car

1465
01:55:36.18 --> 01:55:39.28
Army uniform looked up at me. I could see fear in his eyes

1466
01:55:39.64 --> 01:55:46.16
The team searched the surrounding area once it was cleared. We loaded our captive into the VLRA last going I followed

1467
01:55:47.08 --> 01:55:52.44
Behind in the SUV we recovered from the rebels since the rebels were treated as common criminals

1468
01:55:52.44 --> 01:55:57.96
We handed the guy over to the local police station then made our way back to the sections tent and parked the SUV

1469
01:55:58.24 --> 01:56:02.96
beside Colonel Pugus command tent Colonel Pugus. Thank the section for a job well done

1470
01:56:03.08 --> 01:56:08.08
Captain Rauble's debrief was shortened to the point. It was a close call and could have easily gone bad

1471
01:56:08.08 --> 01:56:13.84
It was a good lesson for all of us as an aside Captain Rauble told me that my reaction could have been a lot better

1472
01:56:13.84 --> 01:56:17.54
He was right. I should have dealt with the rebel more aggressively true

1473
01:56:17.54 --> 01:56:22.96
I had been good position to engage the rebel, but the situation didn't necessarily require deadly force

1474
01:56:23.42 --> 01:56:30.06
Having to make a life or death decision was new to me shooting or killing a fellow human being isn't a natural act or a first reaction

1475
01:56:30.18 --> 01:56:31.70
For a kid from Canada

1476
01:56:31.70 --> 01:56:37.46
It is a conscious and considered act after all what separates that's what separates professional soldiers from others

1477
01:56:37.46 --> 01:56:41.50
Our work would continue to provide me with opportunities to refine my new profession

1478
01:56:42.06 --> 01:56:45.34
The following day two rebels will found dead in the tall elephant grass

1479
01:56:45.34 --> 01:56:47.34
The rebel whose life I had spared

1480
01:56:48.10 --> 01:56:54.82
The police executed him it was quick and brutal justice and won all two from a year in this part of the world

1481
01:56:56.26 --> 01:56:58.26
Roger learning curves

1482
01:56:59.14 --> 01:57:03.06
Lasco, not even mentioned Lasco ski his grandfather was a Polish legionaire

1483
01:57:04.06 --> 01:57:07.02
Mary Delady in Indochina Vietnamese and

1484
01:57:08.02 --> 01:57:11.74
That's the history of his so he looks he's French he looks

1485
01:57:11.74 --> 01:57:14.74
Vietnamese with a Polish last name

1486
01:57:16.74 --> 01:57:22.26
All of it in one the legionaire with the history, but yeah that situation was definitely

1487
01:57:22.78 --> 01:57:28.42
You know I'm thrown into the the den learning curve lack of training lack of experience

1488
01:57:28.94 --> 01:57:34.86
Turn out well, but again lesson learned and took that with me to the next job

1489
01:57:34.86 --> 01:57:45.66
Yeah, this again for me this is really good sort of escalation of your of your learning right like even the even the first night

1490
01:57:45.66 --> 01:57:50.42
Where right maybe there's a few the very first mission you did were like nothing really happened luckily

1491
01:57:50.42 --> 01:57:55.78
This didn't happen that night because you had just a little bit more experience a little bit more ready for it and

1492
01:57:57.02 --> 01:58:02.90
You know what I think we talked about with you did through sometimes like or or any type of combat of training

1493
01:58:02.90 --> 01:58:07.58
You get used to it so now when somebody grabs you in a street fight for real

1494
01:58:07.78 --> 01:58:10.58
You're like okay, I know what to do but

1495
01:58:11.66 --> 01:58:17.90
Even if you're on the mat all the time even if you're a black belt in jujitsu if you haven't been in a real fight before

1496
01:58:17.90 --> 01:58:23.94
There's still that last little thing that last little hurdle but over come mentally where

1497
01:58:24.62 --> 01:58:30.10
You you need to act decisively and make things happen whereas

1498
01:58:30.10 --> 01:58:39.14
That's not what's happening on the training mat. It's just not a real fight has it's different and so the only way to

1499
01:58:40.34 --> 01:58:46.62
Overcome that as you got it like overcoming that's why you hope the first fight you get in is with a guy that was an NCAA

1500
01:58:46.62 --> 01:58:49.62
Collegiate wrestler or Golden Gloves boxer because

1501
01:58:50.18 --> 01:58:53.58
You won't learn much you won't learn much you'll learn that you don't know anything

1502
01:58:53.58 --> 01:59:00.38
Whereas if the first fight you get in is getting some drunk guy that's you know acting like an idiot who doesn't know how to fight cool

1503
01:59:00.38 --> 01:59:03.82
You learn and you can you can move in the right direction

1504
01:59:04.50 --> 01:59:09.78
So long book. Yeah, yeah, you can improve your game without with very limited risk

1505
01:59:10.38 --> 01:59:15.58
So yeah, I know it was yeah, definitely I'm curve there everything's new

1506
01:59:17.22 --> 01:59:21.42
But soldier at least some learning the trade and that's part of

1507
01:59:21.42 --> 01:59:24.62
You know becoming a soldier and growing as a young man is

1508
01:59:25.02 --> 01:59:30.22
You know you think okay, I want to be a soldier and you got these visions of things that you will be doing or want to do

1509
01:59:30.22 --> 01:59:36.54
But life will check that and show you what you're you're made of and what you're capable of and that's what I'm I'm seeing

1510
01:59:36.54 --> 01:59:42.62
What I'm made of what I'm capable of some of it's good some of this bad but growing up is learning and taking with that

1511
01:59:43.26 --> 01:59:47.90
Or with from that what you can and are you just completely stoked at this point though?

1512
01:59:47.90 --> 01:59:51.16
I mean from a perspective like a more focused on not

1513
01:59:51.16 --> 01:59:55.36
Fucking up God, you know, I'm new to the team. I'm not theoretically a team member yet

1514
01:59:55.36 --> 01:59:58.08
I'm just this replacement fortunate to be there

1515
01:59:58.08 --> 02:00:01.60
But I know eyes around me certainly the captain's watching me as the other guys

1516
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:04.12
I mean that's keys your your peers right the guys are with you

1517
02:00:05.32 --> 02:00:07.32
So I'm just trying not to discover up

1518
02:00:07.32 --> 02:00:11.88
Yeah, and that that worked in my favor. I'll be it you know, maybe my reaction wasn't

1519
02:00:12.52 --> 02:00:15.52
textbook, but whatever and result was

1520
02:00:15.52 --> 02:00:23.28
Successful and you know once once once you're once you're part of a little something then you're you gain that a little bit of traction with the team

1521
02:00:23.28 --> 02:00:26.40
They start to know what you're made of and then continues on

1522
02:00:28.32 --> 02:00:30.32
Yeah, that's good

1523
02:00:31.52 --> 02:00:33.52
Yeah, you know

1524
02:00:33.92 --> 02:00:40.72
We trained so realistic. We were so lucky like the the capability that we had with training was just awesome

1525
02:00:40.72 --> 02:00:49.04
Like we'd be doing paintball and and this multi million dollar laser tag system and explosions going off special effects

1526
02:00:49.92 --> 02:00:53.52
It was really really good and it would really mitigate

1527
02:00:54.04 --> 02:01:01.92
This kind of opening shock that guys would get and that was always my goal when I was running training was to mitigate that opening shock

1528
02:01:02.64 --> 02:01:08.36
And you know what you see this a lot is with like you know with police officers that don't get great training

1529
02:01:08.36 --> 02:01:11.72
They they're day to day job

1530
02:01:13.16 --> 02:01:16.76
We'll escalate into a life or death they'll go they'll go

1531
02:01:17.72 --> 02:01:23.20
300 days or two or three or five years without ever drawing their weapon

1532
02:01:23.48 --> 02:01:30.92
Without with that with that idea, you know coming out of the academy and every day that that idea of drawing their weapon goes

1533
02:01:30.92 --> 02:01:38.68
Deeper and deeper deeper deeper into the negative possibilities of it happening and then all of a sudden it boom

1534
02:01:38.68 --> 02:01:42.12
It escalates and you can see that once again

1535
02:01:42.68 --> 02:01:48.52
This opening shock of wait a second, you know, there's someone with a gun or there's a bad situation

1536
02:01:48.52 --> 02:01:50.52
There's a woman screaming or whatever it is

1537
02:01:51.72 --> 02:01:57.32
They can't process it quickly enough and they don't have experience processing it and that's a real problem and

1538
02:01:57.32 --> 02:02:02.12
And that's why these you know what I've said before is like

1539
02:02:02.84 --> 02:02:09.16
I think police should should train one one fifth of the time like a won't 20% of the time they should be training

1540
02:02:09.16 --> 02:02:14.04
So five days at work cool one of those days you're just going through eight hours of training

1541
02:02:14.04 --> 02:02:17.88
That and who would you rather have policing your neighborhood?

1542
02:02:18.36 --> 02:02:21.72
Ten cops at the same time that are all

1543
02:02:21.72 --> 02:02:27.88
Haven't trained in a year or eight cops who have all trained a bunch the answer is so clear

1544
02:02:28.44 --> 02:02:32.60
But man, it just doesn't happen. Nope. Yeah, you can never train

1545
02:02:32.60 --> 02:02:34.60
I mean that's how you feel doing I mentioned later on as you know

1546
02:02:34.60 --> 02:02:39.40
You this is where you realize that shit. I should have maybe spent a little more time on certain things on the range

1547
02:02:40.28 --> 02:02:42.76
On the job training isn't necessarily the best

1548
02:02:43.40 --> 02:02:47.16
system but that's their system and that being said to is you know

1549
02:02:47.16 --> 02:02:51.72
I've just come off it's not like I just that was on time off and throw them into into bungie

1550
02:02:51.72 --> 02:02:54.60
I've been you know going full on from a year now

1551
02:02:55.88 --> 02:03:00.52
So it is what is and budget is obviously we don't quite have the same budget or they don't have the same budget as a

1552
02:03:00.52 --> 02:03:02.84
Seal team obviously and the technology

1553
02:03:03.72 --> 02:03:05.72
So they they make a work

1554
02:03:05.72 --> 02:03:07.72
And yeah, it seems to

1555
02:03:08.28 --> 02:03:12.44
Seems to come together. It's not perfect, but it's that's how they're there system works

1556
02:03:12.44 --> 02:03:17.48
Yeah, the the thing that really for a young or for anyone

1557
02:03:18.04 --> 02:03:23.24
Anyone going in these stressful situations the ability to take a step back into touch from what's happening is like

1558
02:03:24.36 --> 02:03:28.60
97% of the battle in these situations to take a step back and go

1559
02:03:29.32 --> 02:03:33.24
Okay, I see what's happening right now. Oh, I got we got enemy shooting inside this house

1560
02:03:33.24 --> 02:03:36.20
Okay, instead of me focusing on that I'm just gonna take a second

1561
02:03:36.20 --> 02:03:39.48
I'm gonna take a step back and everyone else is returning fire. That's awesome

1562
02:03:39.48 --> 02:03:43.48
I don't need to return fire. I'm gonna take cover behind this tree and I'm gonna take a look around

1563
02:03:44.20 --> 02:03:46.20
the ability to do that

1564
02:03:46.76 --> 02:03:49.64
Is so powerful compared to

1565
02:03:50.28 --> 02:03:56.20
Oh, they're shooting going on. I'm gonna return fire inside like that yeah, that what that does your brain same thing in the street fight like the ability to go

1566
02:03:56.20 --> 02:04:01.64
Okay, wait a second. This guy is approaching me right now. He's clearly drunk. He's got friends

1567
02:04:02.20 --> 02:04:04.20
I see that his friends over there

1568
02:04:04.60 --> 02:04:09.32
This is gonna be a bad situation if I get into it like just the ability and instead of looking oh this guy

1569
02:04:09.32 --> 02:04:15.000
Is coming at me really you want some that's not the way to go and then same thing with being a

1570
02:04:15.48 --> 02:04:16.76
Being a

1571
02:04:16.76 --> 02:04:18.44
Copper law enforcement

1572
02:04:18.44 --> 02:04:22.28
Will you see something unfolding instead of jumping into it?

1573
02:04:22.92 --> 02:04:25.56
Which is what your instinct is take a step back

1574
02:04:26.12 --> 02:04:31.64
Instead and and take a look around and that's a lesson that I was lucky enough to learn early on

1575
02:04:32.44 --> 02:04:37.48
And then I did get a nice gradual ramp up in combat operations where I was like, okay

1576
02:04:37.48 --> 02:04:43.96
Yep, I came back on okay, you know what I need to take a step back take a wrap off. Yep, you were cool. You saw it was going on, but you could do better

1577
02:04:44.52 --> 02:04:47.16
And and I'm very thankful that that happened

1578
02:04:48.04 --> 02:04:52.04
But you know even like the first time we ever getting shot at I was like okay

1579
02:04:52.28 --> 02:04:56.04
I see what's going on here take a step back. It wasn't freaking out. It was like okay cool

1580
02:04:56.04 --> 02:05:01.80
We can we can here's what I need to be doing because I'm in an leadership position. I want you actually look around and it was like okay

1581
02:05:02.12 --> 02:05:06.20
But that ability to take a step back to touch and look at what's going on is

1582
02:05:06.20 --> 02:05:10.12
So important and you know you're a free fall guy

1583
02:05:10.12 --> 02:05:14.20
It's like your first free fall jump where what do you see on your first free fall jump?

1584
02:05:14.20 --> 02:05:20.20
You see your off-timeter and your off-timeter and your off-timeter and your off-timeter and your rip-quarter and you don't see much

1585
02:05:20.76 --> 02:05:22.92
And then as you get better if you're not tumbling

1586
02:05:23.48 --> 02:05:24.76
Yeah, yeah

1587
02:05:24.76 --> 02:05:27.000
If you're telling me good thing if you're too old to be here

1588
02:05:28.04 --> 02:05:32.76
But as you get better you can see everything and all some of these one minute free falls from 13,000 feet

1589
02:05:32.76 --> 02:05:36.36
seem like a really nice long time and you get to observe all the stuff and enjoy it

1590
02:05:36.36 --> 02:05:42.68
But yeah, but the that's what you need to do is take that step back and train yourself to do that

1591
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
You have to train yourself to do that if you train yourself to take a step back off the firing line

1592
02:05:47.56 --> 02:05:52.60
Quit staring down your gun look at the situation that's unfolding don't jump into the situation

1593
02:05:52.76 --> 02:05:56.52
Take a step back and I think in the training the pre-selection obviously we spent time

1594
02:05:57.08 --> 02:05:58.92
You know clearing houses on the range

1595
02:05:58.92 --> 02:06:04.44
Shoot all that type of stuff so I think they're able to to see the demeanor of the guys and see that you're not a

1596
02:06:04.76 --> 02:06:08.76
You know twitchy character that you're you know you're thinking about things

1597
02:06:09.16 --> 02:06:14.52
Which you know would get you into the team so I was I wasn't prone to just you know going full auto and

1598
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.16
You will know you you know I was handled this situation

1599
02:06:17.16 --> 02:06:21.40
I mean I was more concerned about the opposite not fucking up more than here

1600
02:06:22.04 --> 02:06:24.04
Yeah, that was my

1601
02:06:24.36 --> 02:06:28.28
Yeah, I mean your instincts are you know you like you didn't freak out in this situation

1602
02:06:28.28 --> 02:06:33.24
You you made a decision now weather cap and I will agreed with exactly what you did. It's like okay

1603
02:06:33.88 --> 02:06:38.76
Maybe he was pissed because you because he still had his weapon or yeah, maybe he thought you should have just killed him

1604
02:06:38.92 --> 02:06:43.72
Which you know as six and one half dozen the other what you could have done there what you should have done there

1605
02:06:43.88 --> 02:06:47.40
If you killed the guy and it ended up he was carrying a stick or whatever

1606
02:06:47.48 --> 02:06:51.48
Then you're all of a sudden you're the bad guy for killing some civilian that was hiding in the woods

1607
02:06:51.96 --> 02:06:57.000
Carrying his baby or whatever right I mean you were worst case. Yeah, yeah, or worst case

1608
02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.20
You blew on blue situation, which is yeah, so

1609
02:07:01.24 --> 02:07:07.08
You know you were you were cognizant of what was going on like just the simple fact that you recognized it could be a teammate

1610
02:07:07.24 --> 02:07:12.04
Man there's some people that don't they go straight from zero to a hundred miles an hour and they're just thinking oh

1611
02:07:12.04 --> 02:07:15.72
That's a bad guy. They're shooting going on and they're pulling that trigger before they think about it

1612
02:07:15.72 --> 02:07:20.76
So you were thinking through it and it shows that the training that you did go through even though it might not have been this

1613
02:07:22.20 --> 02:07:24.36
The simulated combat that we did

1614
02:07:24.36 --> 02:07:30.76
You know when you're jumping out of airplanes when you're clearing rooms all time you have to learn to do that

1615
02:07:30.84 --> 02:07:36.60
Somewhat and obviously you had at this point and I was putting you know on that patrol. I was in the rear a position that was less

1616
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.32
Well with responsibility, but yeah

1617
02:07:41.32 --> 02:07:45.08
Yeah, for sure Greg call right if I'm the leader of that you're a new guy you just showed up here

1618
02:07:45.08 --> 02:07:49.40
I'm absolutely you can be rare security. It was no fool. Yeah, obviously there for reasons so he was yeah

1619
02:07:50.04 --> 02:07:52.04
Yeah, it was learning my trade my craft

1620
02:07:52.04 --> 02:07:54.04
Welcome to the combat arms

1621
02:07:55.08 --> 02:08:00.52
Good way to learn that it was easy. Yeah, everyone will do it against now the situation starts to intensify

1622
02:08:00.52 --> 02:08:05.48
Embassy in foreign national neighborhoods were placed under a permanent guard and French military checkpoints

1623
02:08:05.48 --> 02:08:09.40
We're established along the cities main arteries and roads leading to international airport

1624
02:08:09.96 --> 02:08:15.88
The airport terminal was secured by French foreign Legion and the French Marines

1625
02:08:15.88 --> 02:08:21.72
Rebels have been firing RPG rockets and mortar rounds from their side of

1626
02:08:22.44 --> 02:08:27.24
PK zero into pro government neighborhoods and locals were being killed

1627
02:08:27.48 --> 02:08:33.32
Our new task was to deter this behavior. So here's another operation our objective was to find a good vantage point

1628
02:08:34.52 --> 02:08:39.08
And neutralize anyone with a weapon either on PK zero or on the other side

1629
02:08:39.80 --> 02:08:42.36
So this is your owner to a sniper over watch type position

1630
02:08:42.36 --> 02:08:49.24
We found a suitable side behind a small but sufficient retaining wall and agreed on arcs of fire

1631
02:08:50.36 --> 02:08:55.32
Within minutes bullets cracked overhead the shots were off target, but they clearly aimed in our position

1632
02:08:55.72 --> 02:08:58.92
Seconds later. I saw figure standing in a small opening

1633
02:08:59.40 --> 02:09:04.52
Between buildings he let out a short reckless burst of fire in our general direction before disappearing

1634
02:09:04.76 --> 02:09:10.60
The distance and lack of flight made it hard to see but the AK sound was definitive. I waited

1635
02:09:10.60 --> 02:09:17.56
Sure enough the stupid fucker fired at us again my response was quick. I fired a succession of single action shots at the target

1636
02:09:17.72 --> 02:09:22.52
Did I hit my mark? I wouldn't have been far off. I knew that. He didn't step out again

1637
02:09:23.08 --> 02:09:30.44
We then moved a short distance away and sought better cover the plan was to cross PK zero and start clearing buildings and

1638
02:09:30.68 --> 02:09:33.48
General area from where we had been targeted

1639
02:09:33.48 --> 02:09:40.28
We put down effective covering fire shooting through gaps in the wall directly at our target to well placed AC

1640
02:09:40.52 --> 02:09:45.32
58 anti-personel grenades flew straight hitting their mark the enemy ceased

1641
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.12
Half of our section then made a short sprint across PK zero under the other half's covering fire

1642
02:09:52.76 --> 02:09:57.40
Then they remained across we waited in the dark no shots no rebel seen nothing

1643
02:09:57.40 --> 02:10:04.76
Putting on our night vision goggles we made our way down a dark embankment into taller elephant grass leading into a large open field

1644
02:10:04.76 --> 02:10:10.68
Without warning a high pitch scream stopped us in our tracks are lead it surprised a local with his pants down

1645
02:10:10.68 --> 02:10:11.96
Relieving himself

1646
02:10:11.96 --> 02:10:17.24
daylight was approaching and we checked the area to make sure he hadn't thrown a weapon into the grass

1647
02:10:17.48 --> 02:10:20.12
Then we called it a night returned to our sleeping bags

1648
02:10:21.40 --> 02:10:24.84
Yes, so we called after the initial I guess we called contact

1649
02:10:24.84 --> 02:10:30.20
We radio further us the team to come and they came and then we we crossed the the avenue

1650
02:10:31.48 --> 02:10:33.48
But yeah, there was another I guess

1651
02:10:35.80 --> 02:10:39.24
Experience in soldering and you know the chance to use my weapon for the first time

1652
02:10:40.44 --> 02:10:45.80
And learning from I guess the time before you know I there's no second guessing I knew

1653
02:10:46.68 --> 02:10:48.68
What I was looking at

1654
02:10:49.48 --> 02:10:51.48
And yeah, did my

1655
02:10:51.48 --> 02:10:56.04
Did my job and of course I love this section because guess what you guys are doing cover and in moving

1656
02:10:57.16 --> 02:10:59.16
Fundamental fundamental

1657
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.32
Combat tactic and that's exactly what you guys are doing putting down covering fire maneuvering

1658
02:11:05.40 --> 02:11:07.96
And that's what you have to do and that's the that's the way it works

1659
02:11:08.28 --> 02:11:11.72
It doesn't matter if you're in the French for an Legion or if you're in the Marine Corps if you're in the sealed teams

1660
02:11:11.72 --> 02:11:16.68
That's what you do and I think we with a cross trading we learned from from others the best

1661
02:11:16.68 --> 02:11:22.20
Method of getting the job done and now we've been training on fire movement and stuff for for a while

1662
02:11:23.16 --> 02:11:25.16
Yeah, which is good

1663
02:11:26.20 --> 02:11:28.20
Got to do it. Yep

1664
02:11:28.20 --> 02:11:30.20
You guys get back on base and

1665
02:11:30.92 --> 02:11:36.44
While lying in bed and you're writing you're right actually right in the letter your back on base lying in bed writing and sweating in the

1666
02:11:36.84 --> 02:11:41.40
Central African heat increased radio chatter from the command tent got my attention

1667
02:11:41.40 --> 02:11:44.76
It wasn't long before an NCO stuck his head into our tent and said let's go

1668
02:11:44.76 --> 02:11:54.36
With the VLR a loaded we drove at speed to where third company section had ventured too close to camp Cassie and came under heavy caliber fire

1669
02:11:55.08 --> 02:12:00.12
Passing thirds VAB we disembarked and made our way through the bush to the high ground

1670
02:12:00.44 --> 02:12:06.10
Where the rebel fire had originated. I heard the distinct double tap of a femos my saying that right yep

1671
02:12:06.10 --> 02:12:09.32
Fumos up ahead because it's an it's an FA right

1672
02:12:09.32 --> 02:12:14.92
This is the right it's the rifle with like a magazine is out or sorry behind

1673
02:12:15.64 --> 02:12:21.80
Is it behind your trigger? Yeah, exactly. It's kind of a funky set up. Yeah, they've replaced it since but it's a good weapon

1674
02:12:22.84 --> 02:12:25.36
As I arrived on scene broken pridget

1675
02:12:25.64 --> 02:12:32.84
We're standing next to a four by four pickup truck with a 50 caliber machine gun mounted and it's better rebel fighter was lying face down in a ditch

1676
02:12:32.84 --> 02:12:37.08
He was alive but suffering the frex of Brooks double tap a few days later

1677
02:12:37.08 --> 02:12:43.28
Our third company came under fire in the same place once again. We deployed the third cut down a rebel with their VAB mounted

1678
02:12:43.96 --> 02:12:49.16
50 caliber he was lying on the road clearly dead the 50 caliber round had done serious damage ripping

1679
02:12:49.56 --> 02:12:52.20
half his chest away. It wasn't a pretty site

1680
02:12:54.12 --> 02:12:55.88
And then you're proceeding

1681
02:12:55.88 --> 02:13:03.48
Another situation after clearing a hot. I stepped out to the sound of an RPG rocket flying directly over our position

1682
02:13:03.48 --> 02:13:09.48
Exploding well behind us. We took cover at the same time trying to pinpoint the origin quickly regrouping

1683
02:13:09.56 --> 02:13:12.60
We continued our advance using fire and movement drills

1684
02:13:13.16 --> 02:13:16.68
One covering the other in short bounds. This is classic cover move

1685
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.92
But as we progressed the shout grenade sent everyone diving

1686
02:13:21.56 --> 02:13:25.56
I threw myself on the ground covering my head in a natural and time honored fashion

1687
02:13:26.60 --> 02:13:33.000
a friendly high explosive AC 58 anti-personal grenade detonated on the ground sending dirt and

1688
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:40.20
Shrapnel flying in all directions in the heat of battle the AC 58 had mistakenly been fired vertically by one of our team

1689
02:13:41.24 --> 02:13:47.08
I lay still for a few seconds and after everyone confirmed the OK we resumed our advance

1690
02:13:48.36 --> 02:13:52.84
So there you go somebody had an AD with the human error. I'd always creeps up

1691
02:13:53.56 --> 02:13:55.56
At least they had the

1692
02:13:55.56 --> 02:14:01.08
Sense to call it out, huh? Yeah, yeah, that's a that's a decision making like hey

1693
02:14:01.08 --> 02:14:06.92
Do I tell everyone what that was do you put on just unless exactly yeah because you you think yourself well

1694
02:14:06.92 --> 02:14:11.16
What are the chances if you had any kind of angle on that thing you'd be fine?

1695
02:14:11.40 --> 02:14:13.40
But if you fired that thing straight up

1696
02:14:13.40 --> 02:14:16.52
Oh yeah, that things come in back now nightmare

1697
02:14:17.80 --> 02:14:19.80
Luckily, you know

1698
02:14:19.80 --> 02:14:21.80
Found out no one was injured

1699
02:14:21.80 --> 02:14:25.64
That's an lesson yeah for everybody for those of you that we just kind of skip past

1700
02:14:25.64 --> 02:14:31.96
Understanding what happened the guy had a grenade launcher it's actually it's a

1701
02:14:32.44 --> 02:14:37.40
Any personal grenade that goes on the end of your film us and you can shoot it so it's like a rifle fired exactly

1702
02:14:37.72 --> 02:14:39.72
So it's a rifle fired grenade that

1703
02:14:41.64 --> 02:14:47.000
Can that way you can get and you don't have to throw a grenade you can use your rifle to shoot it basically and the guy

1704
02:14:47.56 --> 02:14:52.44
Had an accidental discharge had it pointed at high port up in the sky and shot it straight up in the air well

1705
02:14:52.60 --> 02:14:54.60
What goes up must come down let's come down

1706
02:14:54.60 --> 02:14:57.56
And so luckily he called out grenade

1707
02:14:58.12 --> 02:15:02.20
Because if you wouldn't have done that then you know if you're standing up on that thing hits oh yeah

1708
02:15:02.76 --> 02:15:06.52
The frag pattern of a grenade is up and out exactly what's inside for you

1709
02:15:09.24 --> 02:15:12.28
Sure that debrief was fun yeah kept in rollhead is

1710
02:15:14.12 --> 02:15:16.12
handful

1711
02:15:16.84 --> 02:15:24.12
This is where things start to get even more intense a French military delegation had met with rebel commanders at the gas station to

1712
02:15:24.12 --> 02:15:30.68
Discuss certain terms and it didn't go well as the French staff car left the rebels open fire

1713
02:15:32.68 --> 02:15:39.72
Some RPM snipers positioned in an apartment complex covering the meeting had it reacted appropriately the dead rebels at our feet

1714
02:15:39.72 --> 02:15:45.16
When the result of their effective market marksmanship it wasn't long before two rebel commanders and their subordinates

1715
02:15:45.48 --> 02:15:50.84
Return to the scene apparently under under and agreed truths our photo ops cell

1716
02:15:51.40 --> 02:15:53.08
NCO sergeant

1717
02:15:53.08 --> 02:15:55.08
Chief test then Marie

1718
02:15:55.88 --> 02:16:00.36
Test turnier test and year was instructed to take pictures for future reference

1719
02:16:01.16 --> 02:16:04.60
So that's you guys got called out to see what had gone down later that evening

1720
02:16:05.16 --> 02:16:10.20
We gathered in our OP and we could sense that things had changed Captain Roul gave his orders

1721
02:16:11.40 --> 02:16:14.04
a COS super poema

1722
02:16:14.60 --> 02:16:20.20
Armed with 20 millimeter cannon would engage this cities main power station in the early hours of the morning

1723
02:16:20.20 --> 02:16:26.28
It was our single or is our signal to assault the ponte Jackson bunker site and adjacent buildings

1724
02:16:26.68 --> 02:16:30.60
Once that objective was achieved we would venture deeper into rebel health territory

1725
02:16:31.72 --> 02:16:37.72
My initial responsibility in all this was to drive the P4 behind the teams of VAB and use it is cover

1726
02:16:37.80 --> 02:16:42.12
Once the VAB had smashed through the makeshift barricade of burned out cars on the bridge

1727
02:16:42.52 --> 02:16:46.76
I was to break left and assault the building adjacent to the rebel bunker

1728
02:16:46.76 --> 02:16:53.72
The second P4 following behind us would stop short of the bunker my second responsibility once I brought the P4 to

1729
02:16:53.72 --> 02:16:59.80
A stop was to dismount and fire an AC 58 anti-personel grenade into the buildings left window

1730
02:17:00.28 --> 02:17:07.24
Another team and teammate L. Wahidi would do the same to the right window and then we would clear the building

1731
02:17:07.80 --> 02:17:11.32
The VAB would stop and unload its personnel to clear the second target

1732
02:17:11.32 --> 02:17:17.16
Building to the right of the main road and then if needed provide close fire support for the team with its 50 cal

1733
02:17:18.60 --> 02:17:25.48
We discussed our fallback positions dealing with trauma and other details or scenarios once the briefing was completed

1734
02:17:25.64 --> 02:17:27.64
We were told to go kid up

1735
02:17:28.36 --> 02:17:35.000
With the with the P4 position behind the VAB I dropped the hinged windshield forward flat under the hood

1736
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:41.48
The call to prayer rang out reverberating off in the distance I found myself considering my current situation

1737
02:17:42.04 --> 02:17:50.68
Having joined the French Foreign Legion only two years ago. I was about to assault a rebel-held position in central Africa with the regiments GCP

1738
02:17:51.40 --> 02:17:57.56
I was full of emotions nervousness uncertainty and excitement at what lay ahead fear was a factor two

1739
02:17:58.12 --> 02:18:01.56
I wasn't afraid of dying per se, but I didn't want to screw up

1740
02:18:01.56 --> 02:18:06.44
We were all being counted on we were after all a team

1741
02:18:08.36 --> 02:18:13.48
This is legit operation right here. Yeah, yeah, it's good shit

1742
02:18:14.52 --> 02:18:18.28
For you know a young young soldier that's out there to test himself and

1743
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.16
Apply to us to his trade. This is this is

1744
02:18:21.88 --> 02:18:27.08
Getting there. Yeah, no, this is this is a legit operation and I'm honored to you know a lot of the guys are like

1745
02:18:27.08 --> 02:18:32.12
LYD with told me he was a senior in suit. He was like this doesn't happen all the time on your your fortune to be here

1746
02:18:32.12 --> 02:18:37.96
So consider yourself lucky, which I did yeah, yeah, I mean you but then again all the morning is to deploy your weight

1747
02:18:38.36 --> 02:18:42.52
Yeah, you got the air support. They're actually gonna start with 20 millimeter cannon taking out this

1748
02:18:42.68 --> 02:18:48.04
I mean, this is a this is a nice op. Yeah, the quality operation the 20 mil account

1749
02:18:48.04 --> 02:18:55.32
That's on another position, but it's our signal to go. Yeah, yeah, but I'm saying it's a big coordinated operation and you guys are doing a fall on a soul

1750
02:18:55.32 --> 02:19:00.84
That's a commencing with grenades. Hey, you don't shoot on the officers in the back. Yeah, I'm trying to pay

1751
02:19:02.28 --> 02:19:04.28
Fair enough and

1752
02:19:06.04 --> 02:19:10.12
Little nervousness a little uncertainty and then the standard and I'm not trying to

1753
02:19:13.56 --> 02:19:18.76
Take anything away from that, but everybody says myself included like what your afraid of is letting it let them someone down

1754
02:19:19.16 --> 02:19:21.16
Yeah, that's definitely letting down the team

1755
02:19:21.16 --> 02:19:23.16
So

1756
02:19:24.04 --> 02:19:25.32
So

1757
02:19:25.32 --> 02:19:30.84
Also what was the planning like like did you did you guys participate in the plan? No, so

1758
02:19:32.04 --> 02:19:36.52
Early in the day French Jaguars. I'd gone over and they had photos of the other site

1759
02:19:36.84 --> 02:19:41.80
Which Captain Rulhead and he basically briefed us there with the pictures we went through

1760
02:19:41.80 --> 02:19:44.52
So there was minimal time spent really going over it

1761
02:19:44.52 --> 02:19:50.36
But it wasn't complicated and this is straightforward. Yeah, boom more coming in we all knew our responsibilities and

1762
02:19:51.24 --> 02:19:57.32
There we go. Yeah, continue on as I sat there visualizing a walk through the plan. I detected a sound

1763
02:19:57.32 --> 02:20:01.80
I listened again carefully to make sure my adrenaline kicked in and I was certain I could hear the quiet

1764
02:20:01.80 --> 02:20:05.000
Thought of a Puma helicopters roader blades in the distance

1765
02:20:05.88 --> 02:20:09.72
Here we go. There we go. Where to came over the radio to start our engines

1766
02:20:09.72 --> 02:20:16.84
We looked at one another in smile the OP gates were open and the VAB pulled out with its distinctive turbo diesel engine

1767
02:20:16.84 --> 02:20:19.16
Whistling as it kicked in and accelerated down

1768
02:20:19.48 --> 02:20:24.84
PK zero the VAB then made its right turn onto the dirt road that led to Pont Jackson

1769
02:20:25.08 --> 02:20:27.08
It's 50 caliber opened up

1770
02:20:27.32 --> 02:20:29.72
The sound of the initial burst drowning out everything else

1771
02:20:30.52 --> 02:20:36.36
Shale casing bounced off the road hitting the hood of the P4 and the punch and smell of gunpowder flooded our nostrils

1772
02:20:36.36 --> 02:20:43.08
The VAB then hit the bridge is barricade sending the wrecked cars flying driving over the bridge

1773
02:20:43.32 --> 02:20:48.92
I felt a bloated or right side the impact hit hard enough that I had to fight to keep the vehicle straight

1774
02:20:49.96 --> 02:20:55.72
I managed to make the hard left turn and slammed on the brakes a yawning second of silence followed as the P4 came to a

1775
02:20:55.72 --> 02:20:58.36
Complete stop in a world-written wind of red dust

1776
02:20:58.60 --> 02:21:03.80
We were now at our most vulnerable no longer covered by the VAB and right on top of the target

1777
02:21:03.80 --> 02:21:08.12
Test 10 year on our P4's rear mounted

1778
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:15.40
762 machine gun laid down covering fire and L. Y. D jumped out of the P4. I picked up my

1779
02:21:15.40 --> 02:21:20.44
Famos in the heat of the button the heat of the moment. I took the wrong one a spare carried up front

1780
02:21:20.44 --> 02:21:22.68
Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion

1781
02:21:22.84 --> 02:21:27.88
noticing my error I grabbed the correct Famos from us with the AC 58 loaded on the muzzle

1782
02:21:28.04 --> 02:21:30.04
Taking a step forward as L. Y. D

1783
02:21:30.04 --> 02:21:37.40
As L. Y. D's AC 58 left his weapon I located my target and fired then I reconfigured the Famos

1784
02:21:37.40 --> 02:21:42.52
I was farther away than planned but the AC 58 flew straight and hit the windows lower corner

1785
02:21:42.52 --> 02:21:46.84
Exploding and sending shards of cinder block concrete wooden glass onto the road

1786
02:21:47.16 --> 02:21:52.92
I quickly rechecked my magazine not to L. Y. D that we were good to go and we advanced to the building

1787
02:21:52.92 --> 02:21:58.12
This main entrance using fire and movement we reached the door and I kicked in as hard as I could

1788
02:21:58.12 --> 02:22:03.88
Through your four times until it finally gave way this wasn't ideal but it was reality not a Hollywood movie

1789
02:22:04.36 --> 02:22:06.60
We then cleared the building room by room

1790
02:22:08.12 --> 02:22:13.000
That's a wicked good assault kid off a sledgehammer would have been yeah

1791
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.16
Sludgehammer would have been good because both the

1792
02:22:15.16 --> 02:22:17.64
Perfect door kicking is not as you know a good place to be

1793
02:22:17.96 --> 02:22:23.88
Yeah, I've had that feeling before I'm saying they're kicking a door on this target waiting for an AK 47 to

1794
02:22:24.28 --> 02:22:25.64
enter my back

1795
02:22:25.64 --> 02:22:28.84
But you know what it makes you do kick harder

1796
02:22:31.72 --> 02:22:37.16
Afterwards we joined our two teammates outside they had detained three out of less employees who were kneeling on the ground

1797
02:22:37.64 --> 02:22:41.40
Hands on their heads visibly scared children were used by rebels as air and boys

1798
02:22:42.04 --> 02:22:45.80
Or whatever was needed these kids smartly had hidden when we launched these salts and

1799
02:22:46.52 --> 02:22:48.36
The rebels fled

1800
02:22:48.36 --> 02:22:52.12
After being searched they were told to clear out the boys ran off and disappeared into the darkness

1801
02:22:52.12 --> 02:22:57.08
There's was a childhood a world apart from what I had experienced growing up our team regrouped however

1802
02:22:58.12 --> 02:23:05.000
I noticed my p4 had a nice little flat tire as the section could what did that? I think it was just uh one of the

1803
02:23:06.76 --> 02:23:10.60
Vehicles that we'd smash by you know a piece or whatever something yeah, yeah, slip the

1804
02:23:11.72 --> 02:23:15.40
As the section continued up the road I was left behind with sick Gorlan

1805
02:23:15.96 --> 02:23:19.96
Yes, you're Karlan to cover as I changed the tire

1806
02:23:19.96 --> 02:23:27.56
The Puma flew a loose orbit overhead hammering rebel positions in the distance with its 20 millimeter cannon with the tire replaced

1807
02:23:28.36 --> 02:23:32.36
We drove up the road to rejoin the section waiting some 500 meters away

1808
02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.72
Driving through a smaller crossroads we came under fire from a heavy caliber type round

1809
02:23:38.36 --> 02:23:43.56
Thank God their their aim was off. I watched a red trace around cut past our front

1810
02:23:43.56 --> 02:23:49.96
On marine VAB 20 millimeter at another intersection had mistaken us for a rebel vehicle

1811
02:23:50.44 --> 02:23:56.28
This potentially fatal error didn't really sink in right away and we both laughed nervously once we are clear of danger

1812
02:23:57.40 --> 02:24:03.16
Yeah, I don't know how close it was it's close enough to get our attention obviously and I accelerated

1813
02:24:03.16 --> 02:24:12.04
But yeah, they definitely had had us coin for someone else and yeah, yeah, and yeah, it's it's crazy

1814
02:24:13.96 --> 02:24:18.28
You know, I've I've told the story before there was a blue on blue and when I was in the battle of

1815
02:24:18.28 --> 02:24:20.92
Monty there was nothing happened but there was a

1816
02:24:22.68 --> 02:24:27.64
Humvee that engaged another Humvee like shot at another Humvee. I don't think they hit it

1817
02:24:27.64 --> 02:24:33.48
Yep, but that shows you I mean a Humvee is one of the most distinctive vehicles there is

1818
02:24:34.20 --> 02:24:40.04
You know, especially with the 50 caliber and the turret. I mean it's really obvious what it is and in Ramani

1819
02:24:40.04 --> 02:24:43.40
They didn't have any technical vehicles like you guys we're going against some people tech

1820
02:24:43.40 --> 02:24:46.76
They weren't the enemy didn't have to they had vehicle born IEDs

1821
02:24:47.56 --> 02:24:51.72
But they didn't have weapons mounted on them and they damn shard and look anything like a Humvee

1822
02:24:51.72 --> 02:24:59.40
And so think about what the mental state of a young soldier is that he's out in a Humvee in the city

1823
02:24:59.64 --> 02:25:07.64
He sees another Humvee and and shoot that yeah, like that's how amped up people get that and this is an

1824
02:25:07.64 --> 02:25:13.64
All fairness to the French the the rebels had pickups the same vehicle because they're obviously supplied for the French military

1825
02:25:14.28 --> 02:25:16.28
You know these things happen luckily

1826
02:25:16.28 --> 02:25:22.28
You know it's a third well, but yeah, it's certainly got our attention and it's something you don't think about it

1827
02:25:22.28 --> 02:25:25.40
You know when you're you're on this off whatever you're thinking the bad guy

1828
02:25:25.40 --> 02:25:31.24
You're not thinking the good guy and wham you know, yeah, I got to be thinking about the good guy too. Yes, you do that's

1829
02:25:32.76 --> 02:25:39.96
One of the things that we realized being in combat was you had to do at least as much planning to de-conflect with the friendly forces that

1830
02:25:39.96 --> 02:25:41.96
Yeah, as you did worried about what the enemy was gonna do

1831
02:25:41.96 --> 02:25:50.28
And I think when it's of soldiering, I don't know if that term even exists, but you got to think about you know the mistakes that others are gonna make not not just the enemy

1832
02:25:50.28 --> 02:25:57.48
Yeah, and by the way, I'd rather get shot at all day by the enemy. Yeah, then then friendly who actually hit their target more often

1833
02:25:58.60 --> 02:25:59.32
True

1834
02:25:59.32 --> 02:26:01.72
So here we are back to the book regrouped our section

1835
02:26:01.72 --> 02:26:08.36
We waited at the intersection and it wasn't long before the early morning light brought with it civilian casualties caught in the crossfire and family members

1836
02:26:08.36 --> 02:26:14.52
Asking for help we radioed for assistance and a French military ambulance arrived as the evening adrenaline war off

1837
02:26:14.52 --> 02:26:20.12
We sat idly watching it hit home that these people some seriously injured were innocent victims

1838
02:26:21.96 --> 02:26:27.16
We were soon replaced by a section from the fourth company and made our way back to the Jackson bunker site

1839
02:26:27.40 --> 02:26:32.44
Where we put where we were put on standby for a few hours on further search of the bunker and

1840
02:26:32.92 --> 02:26:36.68
Building several weapons and small ammunition caches were recovered

1841
02:26:36.68 --> 02:26:43.40
After what I sat in the driver's seat of my P4 drinking coffee as two teammates used to use the pyjow

1842
02:26:43.96 --> 02:26:50.52
Rear hold to clear the recovered weapons suddenly a lot loud shot ring out an old French

1843
02:26:51.24 --> 02:26:56.92
Boltaxian rifle had accidentally been discharged to Captain Raoul had a lot to say about that error personally

1844
02:26:56.92 --> 02:26:58.92
I was also unimpressed

1845
02:26:58.92 --> 02:27:01.72
I had coffee all over my combat best pants and webbing

1846
02:27:01.72 --> 02:27:03.72
I

1847
02:27:04.44 --> 02:27:11.40
Did fresh bro to we eventually returned to our own beds and I slept like the dead adrenaline affects people in different ways

1848
02:27:11.40 --> 02:27:16.28
But this adrenaline dump took took it to a whole new level after we had time to rest we were debriefed

1849
02:27:16.76 --> 02:27:21.80
The operation that achieved its objective the rebels had fled Bangguoo. How do you say? Nungi, Bungi

1850
02:27:23.08 --> 02:27:25.72
with their commanders retreating to their native villages

1851
02:27:27.72 --> 02:27:29.32
the

1852
02:27:29.32 --> 02:27:31.32
first RPIMA

1853
02:27:32.52 --> 02:27:42.52
The Marines and the rep didn't suffer any losses although two crew members in a sanghi armored vehicle were injured due to a friendly fire

1854
02:27:42.52 --> 02:27:44.52
Incident with the Puma overhead

1855
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:51.24
The rebels suffered losses. So again, we're gonna blew on blues in every one. Yeah, and I'm like hopefully I'm not focusing too much on the

1856
02:27:51.48 --> 02:27:56.20
The human error on our side, but that is a part of so with respect to you when you're you're doing it for real

1857
02:27:56.20 --> 02:28:01.72
Yeah, people screw up and it's and it's learning from and it you know it was there and I was also

1858
02:28:02.92 --> 02:28:05.56
Aware of my surroundings, you know, I wasn't dumb enough to

1859
02:28:06.28 --> 02:28:10.12
Do not see that the locals were suffering but they have a tough life

1860
02:28:10.44 --> 02:28:14.44
I'm a fortunate kid from you know Western Canada privilege upbringing and I was there

1861
02:28:14.84 --> 02:28:17.56
You know supporting obviously the French efforts, but the same time I could see that

1862
02:28:18.04 --> 02:28:21.16
There's other people in this world that don't have it quite as well and they suffer the

1863
02:28:21.72 --> 02:28:23.72
The consequences of bullshit

1864
02:28:23.72 --> 02:28:25.72
Yeah, so that was always

1865
02:28:26.12 --> 02:28:27.72
Part of my time there. I'm not just

1866
02:28:27.72 --> 02:28:31.80
Kewed up soldier time. I'm also looking around at my surrounding thinking, you know, I'm a lucky guy

1867
02:28:32.12 --> 02:28:35.48
This is you know some people have a tough life. Yeah, no, I

1868
02:28:35.80 --> 02:28:37.80
Traveling the world is definitely

1869
02:28:37.88 --> 02:28:40.84
Left an impact on me in terms of how awesome it is to go

1870
02:28:41.24 --> 02:28:46.84
Well for me in America and then the thing about human error like I don't think you're focused too much on human error

1871
02:28:47.24 --> 02:28:52.92
I think you're focusing enough on human error that hopefully people that listen to this go. Oh, we better not assume

1872
02:28:52.92 --> 02:28:57.40
That's someone in the helicopter that's flying around at night looking at the ground is going to be able to

1873
02:28:58.60 --> 02:29:04.04
Discriminate which one of these vehicles is good guys in which one is bad guys even though it might seem real obvious

1874
02:29:04.68 --> 02:29:09.32
It's not or when you get lazy on the range and you're training think yourself when it's real

1875
02:29:09.40 --> 02:29:13.96
You don't want to be the one screw it up. No, the consequences are high so take your your training seriously

1876
02:29:14.28 --> 02:29:18.84
I was out in the desert just on a training operation. It was daytime

1877
02:29:18.84 --> 02:29:24.36
And I'm trying to signal I was a radio man as a young and listed seal. I was trying to signal a helicopter to come pick us up

1878
02:29:24.52 --> 02:29:27.72
The helicopter is probably at an altitude of

1879
02:29:28.20 --> 02:29:29.16
Like

1880
02:29:29.16 --> 02:29:35.000
No more than a thousand feet. It's low. Yeah, I have a smoke out. I've got like a red smoke out on the ground

1881
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:41.000
And I'm waving an aircraft plant panel around and there's two helicopters a section of helicopters and they can't see me

1882
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.64
And and I just I couldn't believe it

1883
02:29:43.64 --> 02:29:50.12
Helicopter pilots you just can yeah, yeah, and what I realized is like oh to me. It's real obvious because I'm looking at the sky

1884
02:29:50.12 --> 02:29:52.76
There's only one thing to look at these two helicopters for them

1885
02:29:53.48 --> 02:29:58.68
I mean they got I'm like well, I'm by the know all how many knows do they see you know

1886
02:29:59.48 --> 02:30:01.96
Pass the ravine how many ravines do they see they see literally

1887
02:30:03.32 --> 02:30:07.96
Miles and miles and miles and square and I mean eventually it did but it cued me in that

1888
02:30:08.68 --> 02:30:11.40
Man it thing you got to understand other people's perspective

1889
02:30:11.40 --> 02:30:15.32
One of they seeing same thing from a leadership perspective like one is my

1890
02:30:15.88 --> 02:30:22.76
Grant think what are they seeing out of this situation? Does it make any sense to them? Have I explained it clearly enough like actually?

1891
02:30:22.76 --> 02:30:24.76
Probably know you haven't

1892
02:30:24.76 --> 02:30:32.28
So gaining to know other people's perspective or looking at things from other people's perspective is an important tool and what you're saying here

1893
02:30:32.84 --> 02:30:36.92
You know focusing on human errors like people are gonna make mistakes. I mean

1894
02:30:36.92 --> 02:30:43.32
People are gonna make mistakes whether it's a negligent discharge with some recovered weapon or it's shooting a friendly forces

1895
02:30:43.32 --> 02:30:48.92
I mean like that's gonna happen and you have to do everything you can to plan to mitigate that as much as possible

1896
02:30:49.56 --> 02:30:51.56
It's hard to hard job

1897
02:30:53.56 --> 02:30:55.56
And by the way, I mean

1898
02:30:56.76 --> 02:30:58.76
When I was before the war started

1899
02:30:59.88 --> 02:31:01.88
I didn't think that that

1900
02:31:01.88 --> 02:31:11.48
Blue on blue was a possible thing to really happen and you know Jason Gardner who's an awesome guy who's been on this podcast and

1901
02:31:12.92 --> 02:31:14.92
He's talking about

1902
02:31:14.92 --> 02:31:19.48
Having a blue on blue during train. I was running training and he's kind of telling the story about

1903
02:31:20.20 --> 02:31:25.000
How this blue on blue unfolded and he was the same way when I said look you know

1904
02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:29.56
People are gonna have blue on blues and he kind of was rolling his eyes thinking the everyone else must suck so bad

1905
02:31:29.56 --> 02:31:34.12
You know that's ridiculous and sure. I've you put that pressure on him and

1906
02:31:34.92 --> 02:31:41.56
Man things get complicated and people make mistakes and the world looks different through night vision and the world looks different from different angles

1907
02:31:43.40 --> 02:31:45.40
That's why you got to keep things simple

1908
02:31:46.52 --> 02:31:48.52
By the way, log combat

1909
02:31:49.32 --> 02:31:51.08
Train hard fight easy. Yeah

1910
02:31:52.20 --> 02:31:58.04
Did you on being left alone for a few days with ample time for sports sleep general recovery in a beer two at the camps for you

1911
02:31:58.04 --> 02:32:03.24
Was a much needed reprieve but it wasn't long before we were briefed on our next task

1912
02:32:03.24 --> 02:32:07.64
So here comes another one approaching our target a home-built better than others. We waited outside

1913
02:32:07.64 --> 02:32:12.68
It's entrance until signal to enter as we broke through the door. It was obvious that our target wasn't there

1914
02:32:12.84 --> 02:32:18.68
But as family was and they were terrified the younger children were shaken to the bone and the mom and an older sister

1915
02:32:18.76 --> 02:32:25.40
We're trying to comfort the kids to know effect who could blame them here. We were a bunch of phone soldiers with weird equipment on our heads

1916
02:32:25.40 --> 02:32:32.04
Bursting into their simple life. We left the family with bottles of water and some wise advice for the woman's husband

1917
02:32:33.24 --> 02:32:37.96
Our efforts continued and we said ambushes on remote trails leading to rebel villages

1918
02:32:38.60 --> 02:32:43.40
Hiding in the bush through the night cradling my weapon and wearing envy jeez my eyes started to play tricks

1919
02:32:43.72 --> 02:32:50.28
Shadows on the trail began to look like rebels slowly sneaking up on me not to mention the bugs relentlessly buzzing around and

1920
02:32:50.44 --> 02:32:53.48
Crawling on me these were long nights and all in vain

1921
02:32:53.48 --> 02:32:55.48
Our

1922
02:32:55.48 --> 02:32:59.96
Stay in the car was coming to an end and the rep was going to be relieved by another French regimen

1923
02:33:00.20 --> 02:33:03.32
ammunition that would soon expect expire needed to be spent

1924
02:33:03.48 --> 02:33:08.36
So we'd just dedicated an entire data working on our contact drills firing as many rounds as we could

1925
02:33:08.60 --> 02:33:10.60
Captain Raoul arrived

1926
02:33:10.60 --> 02:33:14.28
Later in the day and I was duly summoned with an order to stand to attention

1927
02:33:14.92 --> 02:33:16.60
I was promoted to corporal

1928
02:33:16.60 --> 02:33:24.76
He removed the Velcro premier class patch from my combat vest and replaced it with corporal rank a company with a solid punch to the chest

1929
02:33:25.48 --> 02:33:27.48
So it's stuck properly

1930
02:33:27.96 --> 02:33:33.84
So there you go get your uh get your promotion and then it was back home

1931
02:33:34.64 --> 02:33:40.64
Well back to Calvier back in Calvier everyone was given leave except Mwa

1932
02:33:40.64 --> 02:33:48.80
Salak Garcia both fresh off leave and I were going to the center national

1933
02:33:49.52 --> 02:33:51.52
Day train Monte Camando

1934
02:33:52.64 --> 02:34:01.60
So Camando training correct you see any see we passed the pre entrance exam consisting of a time to relay with sprints push-ups situps chinups any

1935
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.48
obligatory rope climb at the regiment gym

1936
02:34:04.96 --> 02:34:08.24
We then left from our say by overnight ferry

1937
02:34:08.24 --> 02:34:11.28
On towards

1938
02:34:11.28 --> 02:34:18.000
Toward to lose so what's this course all about so this is the French commander course they have three levels one two and three

1939
02:34:19.12 --> 02:34:25.76
In order to be a GCP team member you have to be level two command of qualified and then obviously your halo qualification

1940
02:34:25.76 --> 02:34:30.96
So this is the level one two okay, I had done my level one with the first company got it

1941
02:34:30.96 --> 02:34:36.40
Yeah, so this level two, but it's done for the cost which is the sprints are the French special operations command

1942
02:34:36.40 --> 02:34:42.96
So everything from their G-Gen which is their French any terrorist team to Air Force for their controllers

1943
02:34:43.36 --> 02:34:45.36
regular army and then their

1944
02:34:45.60 --> 02:34:50.88
Commando Marines which is based off similar to the seals is that you know his bear yeah, who bear there's a couple of there's four

1945
02:34:51.28 --> 02:34:54.72
But yeah, so we had all come together and do the course. Oh, that's

1946
02:34:55.28 --> 02:34:59.52
Yeah, pretty good to have a unified course was and my first you know time to

1947
02:35:00.08 --> 02:35:02.08
To see other soldiers

1948
02:35:02.08 --> 02:35:06.48
Because I'm still junior at this point and I haven't done any courses except with other Legionnaires

1949
02:35:06.48 --> 02:35:08.96
So this first time I kind of get thrown into the mesh with other

1950
02:35:09.84 --> 02:35:13.68
French actual French soldiers now are you looking at their lifestyle?

1951
02:35:14.08 --> 02:35:19.68
Seeing a difference it's starting we got I've been busy. Yeah, I can't complain

1952
02:35:19.76 --> 02:35:23.44
But yeah, you start to fatigue and start to kick in and here I am

1953
02:35:24.16 --> 02:35:29.60
You know starting a course and you must be feeling good too like I mean just from that one deployment to the car

1954
02:35:29.60 --> 02:35:35.36
Right, that's got a that's that's pretty all that's an awesome deployment for 19 whatever was this 1995

1955
02:35:35.92 --> 02:35:38.68
Six 1996 that's a freaking good deployment for

1956
02:35:38.96 --> 02:35:44.08
1990 it is agreed yeah and unfortunately that I as I said got to partaking it wasn't the I mean that wasn't a normal deployment

1957
02:35:44.08 --> 02:35:47.92
I'm assuming no no and then the fact that I'm not a qualified team members

1958
02:35:47.92 --> 02:35:50.16
So I'm fortunate that I've gotten thrown into the team that way

1959
02:35:50.72 --> 02:35:54.48
But I don't think I'm there mentally. I'm thinking I need my command of course

1960
02:35:54.48 --> 02:35:59.12
I need to get to the the jump course. I need to you know be a proper team member and pull my way

1961
02:35:59.12 --> 02:36:03.76
So I'm thinking we're just I got to cover these these courses these checks and the box is I'm not really looking back

1962
02:36:03.76 --> 02:36:06.56
Think oh this great you know this will be chapter seven

1963
02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.84
Not at all it sounds like

1964
02:36:10.40 --> 02:36:14.88
Sounds like you did some more maritime stuff with this I'll go to the book here and leave you way learn six

1965
02:36:14.88 --> 02:36:16.88
Manzodex were introduced into the training

1966
02:36:17.44 --> 02:36:24.000
We sat in the crafts the lower deck and guys got seasick from surging swells at times this made vomiting contagious

1967
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.56
Finally never soon enough the boats along with sound and we would make our way out of the deck of

1968
02:36:29.12 --> 02:36:34.56
Intims of six zodiacs were thrown over board at speed and we followed jumping to the sea wearing our wetsuits

1969
02:36:34.88 --> 02:36:38.24
zodiacs were deliberately flipped upside down and we waited beneath them

1970
02:36:38.96 --> 02:36:44.80
Our bodies shaking in the chat and teeth chattering uncontrollably from the cold if we were too slow

1971
02:36:45.12 --> 02:36:51.68
The instructors would keep us in the water for longer periods of time the least my least favorite training experience by far was

1972
02:36:51.68 --> 02:36:53.68
Swarve on my fucking nerve

1973
02:36:54.32 --> 02:36:58.64
This is this is the is that what you guys called this dog that was just guys. What you made up?

1974
02:36:58.64 --> 02:37:03.20
Okay jammed inside the tarp covered trucks with our backpack the vehicle

1975
02:37:03.20 --> 02:37:08.40
Speed off and then we were ordered to put on our wetsuits in the dark cramped moving space

1976
02:37:08.40 --> 02:37:15.72
The driver purposely squirred violently back and forth sending us crashing into the sides or piling up to the front as he break

1977
02:37:15.72 --> 02:37:17.72
Tard the tactic that

1978
02:37:17.72 --> 02:37:23.24
The tactic was that half of the group would make themselves as small as possible in the corners or signs of the truck

1979
02:37:23.24 --> 02:37:27.24
So the guys in on the inside could change then we'd switch out

1980
02:37:27.48 --> 02:37:30.68
Tempers flared, but we got it done. Yeah, that's just a typical

1981
02:37:32.28 --> 02:37:34.72
Fuck with you. Yeah, that's literally a

1982
02:37:34.92 --> 02:37:40.20
Tempers would flare me you get an elbow crush side of the head you know things got yeah, maybe I have to figure that over yourselves

1983
02:37:40.84 --> 02:37:42.84
a way to get a

1984
02:37:42.84 --> 02:37:49.08
Uh first thing money is again I'm skipping broad swaths of this book, but I'm just hitting some of the highlights

1985
02:37:50.28 --> 02:37:54.28
First thing on Monday morning we took part in hand-to-hand combat drills to get us back on track

1986
02:37:54.28 --> 02:37:58.68
Then we went straight on to an obstacle course rock climbing was on the curriculum with a

1987
02:37:59.08 --> 02:38:03.80
Fastening lesson on knots which we immediately forgot but would be tested on later in the classroom

1988
02:38:03.80 --> 02:38:08.44
We worked on explosive charge calculations and reviewed the explosives range safety rolls

1989
02:38:08.44 --> 02:38:15.80
Continuing on a bit that evening we were woken by stun grenades and German shepherds barking in the barracks doorway

1990
02:38:16.04 --> 02:38:21.24
Instructors in ballacloves dragged us outside and covered our heads with potato sacks the trucks had their high beams

1991
02:38:21.32 --> 02:38:25.40
Directed at us and we were put in stress positions with dogs barking on our faces

1992
02:38:25.96 --> 02:38:32.92
Our personal belongings such as compass knife and flashlight or lighter were taken this was the prisoner of war phase of training

1993
02:38:33.32 --> 02:38:37.72
Stress positions were quite annoying which is the idea and if an instructor notice you slacking off

1994
02:38:37.72 --> 02:38:41.48
You would slap you upside the head and make you either correct the position or change to another one

1995
02:38:41.72 --> 02:38:47.64
The exaggerated push-up position with your rear end as high as you could get it was effective the slabs were not overly hard

1996
02:38:47.64 --> 02:38:52.04
I certainly don't think any of us were close to quitting we knew this was coming

1997
02:38:53.80 --> 02:38:59.16
So you're just getting your yeah, they're just playing with us. We saw you nothing they didn't slap you hard

1998
02:39:00.28 --> 02:39:01.48
Uh

1999
02:39:01.48 --> 02:39:02.28
Yeah

2000
02:39:02.28 --> 02:39:05.32
The first slap that I got at Searschool which was our putt

2001
02:39:05.32 --> 02:39:09.000
I got slapped so good. I was not expecting it

2002
02:39:09.96 --> 02:39:15.16
You know I kind of have I think I had like a because I was 19. I think I had a good cocky look on my face like whatever

2003
02:39:15.16 --> 02:39:20.24
Dude, I got you keep in mind these the training in seals are a rig force. It's not legion anymore

2004
02:39:20.24 --> 02:39:22.24
So they're not quite as

2005
02:39:22.24 --> 02:39:23.52
Apped at

2006
02:39:23.52 --> 02:39:24.88
Smack in it one

2007
02:39:24.88 --> 02:39:29.08
Yeah, yeah, we would it so this was a regular navy guy this guy that slapped me in the case

2008
02:39:29.08 --> 02:39:33.96
There's a regular navy guy and I'm sure he had wrecked red my dossier and said oh here comes a rambo

2009
02:39:33.96 --> 02:39:34.96
Well

2010
02:39:34.96 --> 02:39:38.12
Let's check out some of that. Yeah, so I was giving some cocky answer

2011
02:39:38.12 --> 02:39:41.24
You know he's like what you what is name because it was a Eastern block

2012
02:39:41.72 --> 02:39:47.96
Simulation so they're all speaking with fake Russian accents so he's like what is your name? And I'm like what do you worried about?

2013
02:39:49.56 --> 02:39:54.68
I mean full I don't think I think he's I think he honestly slapped me as hard as he could like I mean it was that hard

2014
02:39:54.68 --> 02:39:59.64
But was it the kind of it isn't palm or like he slapped me as hard as he could you know

2015
02:39:59.64 --> 02:40:04.92
Like but there's a difference so you're watching a slapping competition. Yeah, I know I'm good guys and they get you with this part

2016
02:40:04.92 --> 02:40:09.32
Not good yet, but if you get this part it says that's a superficial he slapped me

2017
02:40:10.20 --> 02:40:12.20
I'm not sure which part of the hand

2018
02:40:12.92 --> 02:40:14.20
But good enough

2019
02:40:14.20 --> 02:40:16.76
Let me put you sweet. It kind of rang my bell a little bit

2020
02:40:16.76 --> 02:40:20.68
Yeah, he's probably got a little bit of professional part a little bit of professionalism. Yeah

2021
02:40:21.32 --> 02:40:23.32
I think so

2022
02:40:23.32 --> 02:40:25.000
check

2023
02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.40
Two of our larger coursemates were this is again fast forward to a larger course

2024
02:40:29.40 --> 02:40:34.28
mates were told to retrieve Jerry cans of water stashed roadside a detonation of white powder followed

2025
02:40:34.28 --> 02:40:38.20
Simulating two casualties using our combat vessel metal poles provided for structures

2026
02:40:38.20 --> 02:40:41.40
We extracted for what I assumed was several kilometers at some point

2027
02:40:41.64 --> 02:40:44.52
I could see headlights in the dark down the road as we arrived

2028
02:40:44.52 --> 02:40:49.56
I realized it was a military transport the instructors then casually told us that we were done

2029
02:40:50.04 --> 02:40:53.40
Confused I asked the instructor if he was sure we were exhausted

2030
02:40:55.16 --> 02:40:58.12
And then completing the Commando Brevei. Is that what you say? Brevei?

2031
02:40:58.12 --> 02:41:02.20
Brevei exactly was physically challenging and that was something I liked

2032
02:41:02.52 --> 02:41:04.52
Having the feeling of being pushed to my limits

2033
02:41:05.64 --> 02:41:11.80
So you get done with this that's phase two that's phase two. So that's my command of qualification now would be the jump course

2034
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:15.48
to be a qualified GCP team member now

2035
02:41:17.40 --> 02:41:19.80
Now you're back on base in Calvary

2036
02:41:20.92 --> 02:41:24.68
I was summoned to the CEA company building and presented myself to

2037
02:41:24.68 --> 02:41:31.32
The duty NCO sitting behind his desk. He ordered me to get gills as I said a jeel jeel

2038
02:41:31.72 --> 02:41:34.84
He ordered me to get jeels dressed uniform and kept me from his locker

2039
02:41:35.88 --> 02:41:43.96
It was an unusual request. I asked a why what's going on without even looking up from his paper work the NCO replied casually

2040
02:41:44.52 --> 02:41:46.52
He's dead

2041
02:41:46.52 --> 02:41:53.000
I was stunned that shock was compounded by the Cavalier even Calus way the NCO had broken the news

2042
02:41:54.60 --> 02:41:59.32
I was angry but controlled my feelings and went to jeel's room

2043
02:42:00.92 --> 02:42:03.88
I recovered as uniform and kept me from his locker

2044
02:42:04.44 --> 02:42:07.08
Inside were photos of his fiance Stephanie

2045
02:42:08.36 --> 02:42:13.56
I quickly networked with others to find out what the hell had happened news eventually trickled back to the regimen

2046
02:42:13.56 --> 02:42:21.000
The CEA first company and section had been deployed to Brazaville in the Republic of Congo

2047
02:42:21.32 --> 02:42:26.60
Fighting between government troops and militiamen loyalty the former leader had escalated requiring a

2048
02:42:26.60 --> 02:42:30.68
Vacuation of some 6,000 expats caught up in the Civil War

2049
02:42:31.56 --> 02:42:36.12
Jeels had been killed during ex-patriation efforts

2050
02:42:37.72 --> 02:42:43.40
His body was due to arrive in Calvary from Africa the next evening and corpus from the CEA's

2051
02:42:43.40 --> 02:42:48.12
rear guard would man his honor guard while he lay at rest in the regimental chapel

2052
02:42:50.04 --> 02:42:56.20
Six of us were designated a carriers coffin onto the parade square for the regimental ceremony scheduled for the following day

2053
02:42:58.12 --> 02:43:02.92
I was excused from course to get my uniform ready and assist in the preparations

2054
02:43:03.72 --> 02:43:09.96
A small private ceremony for Jeels family and Stephanie was held before the regimental parade

2055
02:43:09.96 --> 02:43:13.96
Where all the companies not on tour were present in full parade uniform

2056
02:43:14.84 --> 02:43:19.96
Jeels coffin was moved from the chapel to the center of the parade square

2057
02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:26.52
The French minister of defense awarded Jeels the Post-Jumist Croy

2058
02:43:27.24 --> 02:43:30.12
Deville Valor military the military medal

2059
02:43:31.56 --> 02:43:35.08
The cross of Valor then the regimen sang a regimental song

2060
02:43:35.08 --> 02:43:38.60
You could have heard a pin drop when it was over

2061
02:43:39.80 --> 02:43:41.80
It was a moving moment

2062
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.80
Captain Raoul indicated that I was to attend

2063
02:43:46.92 --> 02:43:48.92
dinner that evening

2064
02:43:49.24 --> 02:43:54.68
in Calvary for the four Jeels and Stephanie's families Stephanie seemed to be taking everything and stride

2065
02:43:54.68 --> 02:43:57.72
But I'm sure she was doing her best to put up a strong front

2066
02:43:59.56 --> 02:44:01.96
I could see that Jeels family was hurting

2067
02:44:01.96 --> 02:44:05.80
Everyone was I wasn't really sure

2068
02:44:06.76 --> 02:44:08.76
What to say or how to act?

2069
02:44:10.36 --> 02:44:13.16
Jeels who is a good man a good soldier and

2070
02:44:14.04 --> 02:44:19.48
Like many other legionnaires before him had made the ultimate sacrifice

2071
02:44:19.48 --> 02:44:32.20
Yeah, so Jeels I had befriended when I got to Bunga he was new on the team but it completed all his

2072
02:44:32.60 --> 02:44:36.20
prerequisites courses so he kind of took me not under swing but we'd run together

2073
02:44:36.52 --> 02:44:41.000
You got everything on what to expect in the commander course the jump course some of the personalities with an

2074
02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:46.04
team like be careful this guy doesn't like you know and so yeah he was a you see a guy and when we got back to

2075
02:44:46.04 --> 02:44:53.72
Friends Stephanie and Meta said one of the French Air Force bases and brought sandwiches for us to eat and so I got to meet her

2076
02:44:54.68 --> 02:45:01.56
So when I came back from commander course I was doing my medics course that they're running on the in Calvary and that's when I was summoned to the

2077
02:45:01.96 --> 02:45:03.96
the front desk

2078
02:45:04.36 --> 02:45:05.000
and

2079
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Control my my temper

2080
02:45:07.56 --> 02:45:09.000
Which

2081
02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.40
Is mentioned because sometimes a legion can be that way cold and calis is what it is

2082
02:45:13.40 --> 02:45:21.08
And yeah Jeels was a good man. He was actually former French airborne quick the French military to join the legion because he wanted to

2083
02:45:21.72 --> 02:45:23.72
Give her to go and

2084
02:45:23.72 --> 02:45:28.36
I paid the ultimate sacrifice so as I thought an important story to share because a lot of people don't

2085
02:45:29.72 --> 02:45:32.68
Think or see that when they think of the legion that there's good men out there

2086
02:45:33.56 --> 02:45:34.84
risk in their lives and some of them

2087
02:45:34.84 --> 02:45:43.88
Pay for it. Yeah, and I didn't read it, but you you go through pretty good detail of what it happened and so that's another reason for people to

2088
02:45:44.28 --> 02:45:46.28
To get the book so you can get that story

2089
02:45:47.32 --> 02:45:52.84
Yeah, and they're out there supporting valid efforts. It's not this misconception that the legion is you know

2090
02:45:52.84 --> 02:45:54.04
I'm third thing

2091
02:45:54.04 --> 02:45:56.04
They're they're supporting humanity and

2092
02:45:56.28 --> 02:45:59.32
Helping where they can yeah absolutely did that

2093
02:45:59.32 --> 02:46:05.80
I mean now is your is your viewpoint of what you're doing changed at all at this point

2094
02:46:07.32 --> 02:46:09.32
In which way in other words

2095
02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.96
Did you have any feelings of hey

2096
02:46:15.56 --> 02:46:18.92
I'm I'm a legionaire we deploy I've been in firefights

2097
02:46:19.56 --> 02:46:21.96
I can't be killed nothing can happen to me

2098
02:46:21.96 --> 02:46:28.28
Did you have any thoughts like well actually 100% that was definitely an eye opener where this is yes series outcomes

2099
02:46:30.36 --> 02:46:34.68
Yeah, it was so bring I guess to a certain point and you realize that yeah, there's a risk of there

2100
02:46:35.80 --> 02:46:37.80
Something you take for granted

2101
02:46:38.36 --> 02:46:39.64
So she had a peacetime

2102
02:46:39.64 --> 02:46:43.72
Army because really things hadn't ramped up that point Afghanistan and kicked off a rack so

2103
02:46:44.44 --> 02:46:46.92
You know it was not a common occurrence for a

2104
02:46:46.92 --> 02:46:53.08
That's what we're from the Rep to be killed in action. So do you know when the last one that was killed in action?

2105
02:46:54.12 --> 02:46:56.12
Prior to just

2106
02:46:57.72 --> 02:47:01.08
I don't I couldn't list it off had there been any others while you were there

2107
02:47:03.16 --> 02:47:05.96
No, there's certainly like two at least two or three years

2108
02:47:08.04 --> 02:47:10.20
Yeah, so it wasn't wasn't common occurrence by any means

2109
02:47:11.24 --> 02:47:14.92
Yeah, well you you don't expect it right because there's no active full yeah

2110
02:47:14.92 --> 02:47:16.92
War is going on and

2111
02:47:17.64 --> 02:47:24.28
Their reception was good to see you know how he was treated the the efforts of the government the French military and the regiment itself you know was nice to see that

2112
02:47:25.16 --> 02:47:27.88
He was thought about after and given the proper honor

2113
02:47:28.36 --> 02:47:29.88
deserved which is nice

2114
02:47:29.88 --> 02:47:33.56
Yeah, how many people leave the French military to join the Legion?

2115
02:47:33.88 --> 02:47:39.56
There's a chunk as I said in the ranks about a third our French nationals. Obviously all the officers are in a little bit

2116
02:47:39.56 --> 02:47:41.56
What was his reason behind it?

2117
02:47:41.56 --> 02:47:45.96
I would assume that when you're in a French regiment the rep is kind of the

2118
02:47:46.76 --> 02:47:51.000
The level to attain and the Legion that has a different history and and discipline

2119
02:47:51.56 --> 02:47:55.32
So I'm guessing based on what he told me he just wanted to come and give it around for himself

2120
02:47:55.96 --> 02:47:57.24
Yeah

2121
02:47:57.24 --> 02:48:01.32
Because we'll work together right so they'll see it and they'll march by it

2122
02:48:01.32 --> 02:48:07.48
I don't know how many steps a minute and high pitch voices in their songs and then the Legion's turn and it's slow and deep boom

2123
02:48:07.48 --> 02:48:09.88
It's it's impressive to be honest with you

2124
02:48:09.88 --> 02:48:15.48
So I think that you know not necessarily that but just the whole the whole vision is tempting

2125
02:48:15.48 --> 02:48:19.64
You're appealing. He wanted what the young man wants. Yes. Go try it

2126
02:48:23.24 --> 02:48:25.24
Awesome salute

2127
02:48:27.64 --> 02:48:29.64
At this point

2128
02:48:30.20 --> 02:48:33.88
You're told that the sections qualified medics were headed to Marseille

2129
02:48:33.88 --> 02:48:42.20
Dispend a week with the cities military firefighters as paramedics and this is something that we do in America too

2130
02:48:42.20 --> 02:48:46.84
We'll take our well at least the seal teams do it. We take our young seal medics and send them out to

2131
02:48:47.64 --> 02:48:52.28
Compton California or Detroit or Baltimore to be in really bad

2132
02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:57.72
neighborhoods to get to work on restaurant. Yeah to get to use their craft live

2133
02:48:57.72 --> 02:49:05.56
Marseille's firefighters were renowned for their professionalism and you got some good

2134
02:49:06.76 --> 02:49:11.80
Not good you got some pretty heavy stories in here our next call was to assist a young boy who hadn't been able to

2135
02:49:11.80 --> 02:49:16.44
Reach his grandfather we met the nine-year-old outside his grandfather's large apartment building

2136
02:49:16.44 --> 02:49:20.68
Which was one of the cities which is we in one of the cities tougher housing projects

2137
02:49:20.68 --> 02:49:27.08
Whereas parents where I had no idea but it wasn't my place to ask really we took the elevator to one of the upper floors and knocked on the

2138
02:49:27.08 --> 02:49:34.04
Grandfather's door nothing we knocked again several times still nothing the NCO check the handle the door was unlocked

2139
02:49:34.44 --> 02:49:42.60
Calling inside he took two steps through the doorway and then turned around ordering one of the paramedics to take the boy back to the elevators and wait with him there

2140
02:49:43.64 --> 02:49:47.40
The NCO indicated that I enter the apartment saying don't touch anything

2141
02:49:47.88 --> 02:49:53.40
I immediately recognize the smell as I was walking inside I noticed a plastic shotgun casing on the floor

2142
02:49:53.40 --> 02:50:00.52
Then two legs partially obscured behind a corner when I looked around the corner the grandfather's body was lying there

2143
02:50:01.24 --> 02:50:09.72
The part the upper part of his skull was missing blood and brain matter covered the walls and the balconies glass sliding door a shock

2144
02:50:09.72 --> 02:50:10.92
Unlay next to him

2145
02:50:10.92 --> 02:50:18.76
I then realized I was standing on some of his teeth. It was a graphic and sickening site and the last thing I had expected when writing up the elevator

2146
02:50:18.76 --> 02:50:26.76
Another incident made an even bigger impression a young girl maybe seven or eight years of age couldn't wake up her mother

2147
02:50:27.40 --> 02:50:35.24
The doctor pronounced the mother deceased as the girl stood in the doorway watching an empty bottle of pills was recovered from her mother's bedside

2148
02:50:37.32 --> 02:50:39.08
Then you continue on another

2149
02:50:39.08 --> 02:50:45.56
dealing with the city street people is also something new to me quite often these were the same individuals day after day night after night

2150
02:50:45.56 --> 02:50:50.92
The homeless drug addicts drugs or people suffering from mental illness most likely all four

2151
02:50:51.32 --> 02:50:58.92
It was an eye opener. I watched a male patient in his late 40s unravel as we tried to administer first aid to his self-inflicted knife wound

2152
02:50:59.24 --> 02:51:02.52
The paramedics actions and attitudes were always professional

2153
02:51:02.76 --> 02:51:10.60
Here was a guy who had just urinated, defecated and caught himself yet the paramedics remained polite and firm with him while trying to help

2154
02:51:10.60 --> 02:51:16.76
The NCO was tougher more direct. I guess you had to be in that type of role

2155
02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:24.04
And that's you know, I always say thanks to the firefighters and paramedics on the show, but you know

2156
02:51:24.60 --> 02:51:32.36
And I know this because when when our guys would go out and work with you know the paramedics and firefighters in big cities or even in small cities

2157
02:51:33.08 --> 02:51:36.20
Like this is what you do with and you deal with it all day long

2158
02:51:36.20 --> 02:51:41.96
Yeah, it's the freaking hard job depressing too. That's why I think you know why I kind of mentioned is

2159
02:51:42.52 --> 02:51:46.12
You're you're in a regiment you're amongst your peers at everyone's kind of you know

2160
02:51:46.60 --> 02:51:54.44
Physically fit type A possibly and then you get thrown into the real world and you see kind of the the sad side of humanity and

2161
02:51:55.88 --> 02:52:01.08
The suffering of certain people and you kind of forget about that and then you see the realities you're like shit man

2162
02:52:01.64 --> 02:52:04.84
There's more out there than than I'm aware of so it was a good

2163
02:52:04.84 --> 02:52:12.20
Learning experience empathy, but also you know also reject me as I'm you know

2164
02:52:12.20 --> 02:52:17.48
Do I want to be a severe am I happy doing what I'm doing what did that what did that experience lean you towards

2165
02:52:18.36 --> 02:52:20.36
Definitely happy with my

2166
02:52:20.60 --> 02:52:21.80
choice of

2167
02:52:21.80 --> 02:52:23.80
Direction at that point

2168
02:52:24.52 --> 02:52:28.36
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of big cities and crowds anyway. It was a good experience

2169
02:52:29.24 --> 02:52:32.04
Not something I certainly wanted to get out and become a paramedic myself

2170
02:52:32.04 --> 02:52:38.68
But it's nice to see other people doing their trades learning from them as a medic

2171
02:52:38.68 --> 02:52:43.40
You know mentioned the book. It's not something that I wanted to do but I thought it was it was definitely a good skill to have as a soldier

2172
02:52:43.80 --> 02:52:45.80
Just for yourself, but also for your teammates

2173
02:52:46.60 --> 02:52:49.32
But you know hospitals all that kind of just

2174
02:52:50.04 --> 02:52:53.40
People with you know mental it's sad and I'm not a huge fan

2175
02:52:53.88 --> 02:52:56.52
So it was it was a good eye opener for me to see

2176
02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:01.48
What's out there yeah and can't myself lucky you know I'll be at home in the French Foreign Legion

2177
02:53:01.48 --> 02:53:03.48
Still a healthy individual

2178
02:53:04.20 --> 02:53:11.000
Yeah, could be worse. Yeah surrounded by a bunch of healthy individuals. It's like a good life people you can trust comparatively

2179
02:53:12.12 --> 02:53:14.12
uh

2180
02:53:14.44 --> 02:53:17.24
After that you get sent to the SOGH

2181
02:53:18.04 --> 02:53:21.48
Which is basically halo score, right? Yes. It's the free falsk glue. In fact the

2182
02:53:21.64 --> 02:53:28.04
SAS used to go there for their training until they started doing their own okay. Yeah, and it sounds like it's kind of a gentleman's course

2183
02:53:28.04 --> 02:53:33.48
And what I mean by that in America means it's not like bootcamp at all. It's the other under the spectrum like hey

2184
02:53:33.48 --> 02:53:39.80
You do you're supposed to do everyone's cool the instructors are there to help you and they're not talking down to you or anything like that

2185
02:53:40.04 --> 02:53:45.40
So that's the atop this course is for the cost so everyone from as I mentioned same as a commander course

2186
02:53:45.48 --> 02:53:47.48
It's a French

2187
02:53:47.72 --> 02:53:53.72
Base rig force done for the training for the French airborne so yeah, it's super laid back in a bit of a

2188
02:53:54.12 --> 02:53:57.000
A change for me going from the rabbit like a shock to your face

2189
02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
Yeah, yeah

2190
02:53:59.32 --> 02:54:01.32
This is the old turn

2191
02:54:01.32 --> 02:54:03.32
uh as you finish it up that school

2192
02:54:05.16 --> 02:54:10.84
Yeah, we go to the book pear shoots were returned and I think the course commanding officer and instructors for how well they treated me

2193
02:54:11.32 --> 02:54:17.08
I left a brand new legionnaires kepty with the Canadian flag inside it at the instructor's bar

2194
02:54:17.56 --> 02:54:18.60
It's cool

2195
02:54:18.60 --> 02:54:23.16
I said my goodbyes to my course mates and then caught a ride back to command to who bear

2196
02:54:23.16 --> 02:54:29.08
Base at two long naval ship yard where Francis new aircraft carrier was docked

2197
02:54:30.68 --> 02:54:35.56
You bears base was off on its own in a wooden area hidden away from the rest of the naval yard

2198
02:54:36.12 --> 02:54:41.32
I looked at its miniature submarines and high speed zodiacs all of the impressive state of the art equipment

2199
02:54:41.56 --> 02:54:48.36
What really caught my attention was a US nuclear tax submarine docked at a long jettie below who bears main training building

2200
02:54:48.36 --> 02:54:55.32
A US seal team was in town across train with them. I was envious to say the least but I had no time for envy

2201
02:54:55.88 --> 02:54:59.48
I needed to mentally prepare for returning to the legion way of doing things

2202
02:55:00.44 --> 02:55:02.44
it's a fact

2203
02:55:02.20 --> 02:55:04.20
that in a bid

2204
02:55:04.20 --> 02:55:11.56
To set itself apart from the rest the legion maintains iron discipline and places heavy restrictions on personal freedoms

2205
02:55:11.56 --> 02:55:17.64
Although this works in short as a short term solution it results in a high turnover

2206
02:55:18.60 --> 02:55:22.28
I also need to get a proper haircut before I'm painting my way back to Calvary

2207
02:55:22.84 --> 02:55:25.72
I've done trouble for the during the course I'd let it go

2208
02:55:26.28 --> 02:55:29.24
The officer charge was like you keep on your soul eagerness brothers

2209
02:55:30.52 --> 02:55:34.76
Yeah, yeah, that's what you know what we were talking about earlier. I mean this is this is how

2210
02:55:35.56 --> 02:55:38.28
This is how so many people for instance

2211
02:55:38.28 --> 02:55:43.32
So many seals stand the seals for 20 years because there's a lot of personal freedom

2212
02:55:43.32 --> 02:55:48.60
I know now look the standard is high and if you drop below that standard it's not gonna be good for you

2213
02:55:48.60 --> 02:55:52.60
It's not gonna work out well, but if you're doing your job and you're doing it well

2214
02:55:53.08 --> 02:55:55.32
You get a lot of personal freedom and it's awesome

2215
02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:00.28
But I mean and like we already talked about it

2216
02:56:00.28 --> 02:56:04.76
You kind of select for it because you give certain amount of freedom along the way, but yeah the

2217
02:56:04.76 --> 02:56:06.76
The

2218
02:56:06.76 --> 02:56:07.76
Legion

2219
02:56:07.76 --> 02:56:10.76
Doesn't do that. No, and I'm sorry to pick up on that you know during this course

2220
02:56:10.76 --> 02:56:12.76
I was there for for a chunk a couple of months

2221
02:56:13.16 --> 02:56:21.32
So working with you know the guys from who bear another regent. You see what a normal military life is like you know they go home and stuff and that's thing

2222
02:56:21.64 --> 02:56:27.32
You meant I didn't you mention but like on the command of course and during the freefall courses on the weekends

2223
02:56:27.32 --> 02:56:30.60
All the guys go home to the girlfriend's families or whatever. I don't

2224
02:56:31.40 --> 02:56:33.40
So that's something for you know a Legion error

2225
02:56:33.40 --> 02:56:38.12
That's me taking consideration. It's it's it's full on you're not going home on the weekends

2226
02:56:38.12 --> 02:56:40.36
And that has its effect so I'm starting to see

2227
02:56:41.56 --> 02:56:44.76
When you're going to the Kandokore so even this freefall course you're not going home on the weekends

2228
02:56:44.76 --> 02:56:46.12
Just because you have nowhere to go

2229
02:56:46.12 --> 02:56:51.48
Are you still restrict you're not restricted? No, they're sorry. We're free I would go down to we would go into Spain and take advantage of our freedom

2230
02:56:51.48 --> 02:56:55.16
And that was another aspect of I open I mean people the other

2231
02:56:55.56 --> 02:56:56.52
You know

2232
02:56:56.52 --> 02:57:03.08
You make friends and you do things that now you know young young men do and I know I'm going back to Calvary

2233
02:57:03.08 --> 02:57:08.60
Which is no longer gonna be that way so I'm starting to look around thinking you know long term is this what I want to be

2234
02:57:08.60 --> 02:57:12.44
Yeah, albeit I'm somewhat fresh to the team but it's it's still that

2235
02:57:13.24 --> 02:57:15.64
I'd decide for next year so I was going to be doing six years

2236
02:57:15.80 --> 02:57:18.68
But I'm starting to think already is this something I want to do is a career

2237
02:57:19.16 --> 02:57:23.32
Become an NCO and and do in the French system you need 15 years to get a retirement

2238
02:57:23.64 --> 02:57:27.96
You got a little taste of Spain and freedom and just yes

2239
02:57:28.52 --> 02:57:31.16
Exactly, you know, yeah, I'm starting to think yeah

2240
02:57:31.16 --> 02:57:36.68
Which is tough on the mental side things right if you're not in you're not in yeah, so it's starting there

2241
02:57:37.32 --> 02:57:41.24
Yeah, it's almost better not to see it as mentioned

2242
02:57:42.04 --> 02:57:45.64
The Legion has changed since they're not quite as aggressive and stringent on the thing

2243
02:57:46.36 --> 02:57:51.64
For that reason the turnover is to give the guys a little more leeway to keep the guys around especially now that they're active and busy

2244
02:57:51.96 --> 02:57:56.44
Yeah, there's yeah, there's no real need if you have any idea what percentage of people go pass their first

2245
02:57:56.44 --> 02:58:03.72
I don't want to sell another check check all right

2246
02:58:06.60 --> 02:58:13.40
Back again the second to fourth companies were headed to Chad, Africa for a four-month torn support of operation

2247
02:58:14.44 --> 02:58:16.44
Epivier

2248
02:58:18.60 --> 02:58:21.72
It's objective was to prevent Libya from disdabilizing Chad

2249
02:58:21.72 --> 02:58:28.52
Chad and threatening Francis interests so back in the game again. We boarded an airbus a

2250
02:58:28.84 --> 02:58:30.84
300 on September 12, 1998

2251
02:58:34.28 --> 02:58:41.96
And on the on the east coast of Corsica flew over the mountains of North Africa and across the rusty dunes of at the Algerian Sahara

2252
02:58:42.44 --> 02:58:44.44
In the northern Chad you get to Chad

2253
02:58:45.96 --> 02:58:50.20
You're on the ground here we go next on the agenda was a three-day section training exercise

2254
02:58:50.20 --> 02:58:55.08
We loaded the VLRAs and started a three-hour drive to east to shoot to a shooting range

2255
02:58:55.24 --> 02:59:03.32
The paved roads served soon turned into a dirt track with large sun-baked ruts that have been carved out by larger transport trucks during the rainy season

2256
02:59:03.32 --> 02:59:07.000
It was a nightmare to drive on and every bump reverberated in my back

2257
02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:12.76
We drove through flat and air-red country passing through small villages were smiling locals waved at us

2258
02:59:13.32 --> 02:59:19.000
Their lifestyle with the most basic of amenities was practically primitive compared to what I had seen before

2259
02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
Even in Central Africa

2260
02:59:21.56 --> 02:59:23.56
But they looked happy

2261
02:59:24.12 --> 02:59:29.64
These images stuck with me. I knew I had opportunities in life well beyond what these people could even dream of

2262
02:59:30.52 --> 02:59:36.20
So you you say that in there and I was kind of highlighted at thinking this these are all things that are starting to kind of

2263
02:59:37.24 --> 02:59:39.24
assemble in your head that

2264
02:59:39.64 --> 02:59:43.56
You're thinking maybe that there could be a life outside the Legion. Yeah, 10%

2265
02:59:43.56 --> 02:59:51.16
Something I found different and interesting now. We're back in this camp that you are in Chad something I found different

2266
02:59:51.72 --> 02:59:57.48
and interesting was the camps employment program where local men women and teenagers or boys as they were referred to

2267
02:59:57.72 --> 03:00:02.84
We're hired to wash our clothing and clean our barracks rooms. They were paid a set rate wage controlled by the camps of

2268
03:00:02.84 --> 03:00:03.48
Administration

2269
03:00:03.48 --> 03:00:08.76
It was a good service and injected some much-needed money into the local economy so we hired Abbo

2270
03:00:08.76 --> 03:00:14.60
He worked hard and we gave him any extras we had or things we didn't really need that he could use on

2271
03:00:14.60 --> 03:00:21.24
Weekends Legionnaires could frequent the cities authorized bars and restaurants all of which were within a small city block

2272
03:00:21.64 --> 03:00:24.44
On weeknights we were confined to camp or the

2273
03:00:25.08 --> 03:00:26.28
Rose events

2274
03:00:26.28 --> 03:00:27.24
Rose devol

2275
03:00:27.24 --> 03:00:29.24
Rose devol

2276
03:00:29.24 --> 03:00:33.32
A local restaurant and bar with a dance floor and working girls

2277
03:00:33.96 --> 03:00:35.96
This was new to me too

2278
03:00:35.96 --> 03:00:45.56
CFB Wayne Wright didn't have a rose devol in the age of AIDS awareness the women were subject to medical checks by the French military hospital

2279
03:00:45.64 --> 03:00:49.64
If they wanted to frequent the Rose sexual encounters were not advised

2280
03:00:49.64 --> 03:00:56.36
But it was a reality so the French military exercise precautions the women were extensively self-employed

2281
03:00:57.16 --> 03:01:05.16
Private contractors I guess you can say and the military's only involvement was providing free medical visits a lot of women were from Somalia and E. P. E. Ethiopia

2282
03:01:05.16 --> 03:01:10.60
Some were tall elegant and attractive and they put in a lot of effort to dress the part

2283
03:01:11.24 --> 03:01:16.28
Inevitably it wasn't long before Legionnaires were getting into trouble at the Rose devol

2284
03:01:17.64 --> 03:01:21.96
So that's another thing that's just different yeah, yeah

2285
03:01:22.44 --> 03:01:27.80
Not really not really seen much of the Ethiopian prostitutes in western Canada. No

2286
03:01:27.80 --> 03:01:33.40
No, no, no. How about trouble follows?

2287
03:01:35.80 --> 03:01:41.000
There's another scenario that unfolded wire down there. I was a woken by a P4 approaching at us at speed honking

2288
03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:47.72
It's towards shots for a medic soon followed. I jumped out of bed through on my combat pants and runners and sprinted outside a panic regular force corporal

2289
03:01:48.28 --> 03:01:54.36
Chief asked me to follow him to meetry and I grabbed our webbing and jumped into our P4 with Smithy at the wheel

2290
03:01:54.36 --> 03:01:59.72
We followed the corporal chief to the garrison's medical building where we found several people standing around another P4

2291
03:02:00.12 --> 03:02:05.08
Demetri approached the casualty who is lying in the back of the vehicle. I could see his legs hanging out the rear door

2292
03:02:05.08 --> 03:02:11.72
Clad and blunt torn blood soaked pants my assumption was that he had been hit and dragged by a vehicle in town

2293
03:02:11.96 --> 03:02:15.24
Demetri yelled for an IV which I prepared and handed him

2294
03:02:16.44 --> 03:02:21.32
I was able to see what we were dealing with the victims right arm was severed at the elbow his bear chest was

2295
03:02:21.32 --> 03:02:24.20
Pockmarked with impacts and his face was missing from the chin up

2296
03:02:25.16 --> 03:02:30.28
The footwell of the P4 was filled with blood a quick assessment revealed that his jugular had been severed

2297
03:02:30.28 --> 03:02:33.48
And his circulatory system had collapsed due to massive blood loss

2298
03:02:34.28 --> 03:02:36.92
The military doctor arrived soon after us

2299
03:02:36.92 --> 03:02:41.32
Prenouncing the victim deceased almost immediately his body was quickly covered with a sheet

2300
03:02:42.04 --> 03:02:45.64
And we moved him from the P4 to the medical building and that was that

2301
03:02:45.64 --> 03:02:51.48
Apparently during a live fire exercise that morning an AC 58 anti-tank grenade

2302
03:02:52.04 --> 03:02:58.84
hadn't detonated on impact the range procedure is to wait 30 minutes and then destroy the grenade in a controlled

2303
03:02:58.84 --> 03:03:05.80
Explosion, but you don't touch it for some unknown reason the victim had picked up the grenade and it exploded

2304
03:03:06.68 --> 03:03:13.000
When I heard his name it rang a bell he had been an NCO in the first company and left behind a wife and two daughters

2305
03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:19.08
This tragedy was a timely reminder to all of us that if you get complacent

2306
03:03:20.04 --> 03:03:22.04
It can kill you

2307
03:03:22.04 --> 03:03:24.04
Yeah, dumb

2308
03:03:24.68 --> 03:03:26.68
But

2309
03:03:27.08 --> 03:03:31.24
At this point in the story in my career, I'm kind of tired of the training

2310
03:03:31.80 --> 03:03:33.80
I don't know if I was spoiled because of bungi

2311
03:03:34.60 --> 03:03:38.60
But yeah, I'm sort of not get lazy, but I'm there's a bit of complacency coming

2312
03:03:38.60 --> 03:03:43.40
I'm just like I went through the motions here, you know, let's let's soldier not pretend

2313
03:03:45.16 --> 03:03:47.80
Yeah, Chad wasn't necessarily a highlight

2314
03:03:48.36 --> 03:03:54.20
Experience there was some I don't get into much, but within the the section there was some

2315
03:03:55.72 --> 03:03:59.32
Negative stuff going on which is hard on any team

2316
03:04:00.60 --> 03:04:04.52
More about just I think the lack of stuff that was going on we had a new CO that wanted us to

2317
03:04:04.52 --> 03:04:09.08
March and sing more I don't get into it because it's not really my place to

2318
03:04:10.12 --> 03:04:14.52
To mention or the common on but Chad was kind of a a pivotal

2319
03:04:16.52 --> 03:04:22.44
Tour where it was like I was starting to slide on the downward trend towards leaving

2320
03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:24.52
It was a good experience

2321
03:04:24.52 --> 03:04:29.08
We did jump out of the back of the helicopter's a lot and that's where I started

2322
03:04:29.08 --> 03:04:34.44
Watching them thinking that's pretty and I'll come there towards you

2323
03:04:35.56 --> 03:04:37.56
Yeah, and

2324
03:04:38.20 --> 03:04:43.16
The Rose Devolves story it's in the book because we become the military police for the Rose Devolves not

2325
03:04:43.96 --> 03:04:48.92
Personal yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you mentioned that is that's what I try to leave it at like hey

2326
03:04:48.92 --> 03:04:54.60
There's they're caused trouble and then eventually you guys have to become military police there and

2327
03:04:54.60 --> 03:05:00.76
But at least I think I mean you send Legionnaires 20 you know 20 to 25 year old into an African country for four months

2328
03:05:00.92 --> 03:05:08.52
You need an outlet. Yeah, it's just a fact of well, you know if you not will find it elsewhere and they get problems right you mentioned the one Legionnaire who was

2329
03:05:09.56 --> 03:05:16.28
His dad was a Polish Legionnaire and yeah, he's what mom was a Vietnamese well, there's think of all the American you know

2330
03:05:17.48 --> 03:05:19.48
The American

2331
03:05:19.48 --> 03:05:27.72
Service members that have got wives over the past however many years wives from Japan wives from the Philippines wives from Germany

2332
03:05:27.72 --> 03:05:31.48
What we know the seal team used to be up in Scotland as much as guys that had wives from Scotland

2333
03:05:31.48 --> 03:05:34.48
Like you put the eyes in the middle of these places well, they're gonna meet the girls

2334
03:05:34.48 --> 03:05:35.84
That's what's gonna happen

2335
03:05:35.84 --> 03:05:39.68
Roger, so so at least they had the fort you know fort thinking to think listen

2336
03:05:39.68 --> 03:05:43.92
We got a protector guys. They're gonna go out there and find it if they we don't so yeah, so it's smart

2337
03:05:44.08 --> 03:05:48.36
Yeah, the American military does not do that. Yeah, the American military does not do

2338
03:05:48.36 --> 03:05:50.36
A

2339
03:05:50.36 --> 03:05:53.48
Metaphylchex and brothels. No, you're not getting that no, it's not happening

2340
03:05:58.28 --> 03:06:03.000
All right, so now you're at another military ski school and you're actually

2341
03:06:03.56 --> 03:06:10.52
Seeing saving private Ryan and you get a recall one of the other guys get to phone call and here we go when we arrived

2342
03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:14.88
Captain Martin briefed us on the situation a French

2343
03:06:14.88 --> 03:06:21.92
J-Dorm, he said it's on down. John Dorm. I swear I looked at I listened to that word getting played like

2344
03:06:22.48 --> 03:06:28.08
19 times and it's exactly how it looks like it says, but I keep screwing up. John Dorm at the French Ambassadors

2345
03:06:28.56 --> 03:06:32.84
Residence in Braz-Aville, Republic of Congo had been shot dead by her military rebel

2346
03:06:33.68 --> 03:06:35.20
the

2347
03:06:35.20 --> 03:06:38.48
cause first RPI

2348
03:06:38.48 --> 03:06:43.72
M.A. had been sent to secure the Ambassadors residents and the GCP would relieve them

2349
03:06:43.72 --> 03:06:45.72
Captain Martin

2350
03:06:45.72 --> 03:06:51.48
Designated those of us who needed to return to Calvary the following day to prepare I was chosen

2351
03:06:51.80 --> 03:06:56.84
We were dismissed and told to be ready in the morning. I handed my handed in my issued kit

2352
03:06:57.16 --> 03:07:02.36
Collected my from us from the armory and packed my gear Demetri wasn't chosen

2353
03:07:02.76 --> 03:07:08.12
He looked like he might jump from the barracks in second story window. I felt his pain

2354
03:07:08.92 --> 03:07:12.80
The final BSM exercise which ran the entire following week didn't inspire anyone

2355
03:07:12.80 --> 03:07:18.64
And so this is another thing I just got to point out like I'm throwing in these names like Demetri and

2356
03:07:19.28 --> 03:07:24.72
You talk about these guys throughout the book and I'm not doing justice of the other characters that are in here

2357
03:07:24.72 --> 03:07:27.36
So I apologize. No, that's why people need to get the book

2358
03:07:28.24 --> 03:07:31.28
to learn about all these different guys and that's just a

2359
03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:33.20
That

2360
03:07:33.20 --> 03:07:37.36
Situation where here you are getting called into a critical combat scenario where you know

2361
03:07:37.36 --> 03:07:41.12
There's gonna be risk and of course what's Demetri he's not going in these past sucks

2362
03:07:41.12 --> 03:07:43.12
Yeah

2363
03:07:43.12 --> 03:07:47.68
Then you have one more little thing in here. You said tell the story about these military issues sunglasses

2364
03:07:47.68 --> 03:07:54.72
Then sucked and you are constantly wearing your civilian sunglasses which work and there's a

2365
03:07:55.36 --> 03:07:57.12
One of the NCOs

2366
03:07:57.12 --> 03:07:59.12
Instructors is kind of like

2367
03:07:59.12 --> 03:08:05.76
Giving you a hard time. That's the captain from the second company. So the officer. Yeah, he's giving you a hard time about it

2368
03:08:05.76 --> 03:08:10.72
And then and finally what you do is you just kind of do what you're supposed to do and you carry two sunglasses

2369
03:08:10.72 --> 03:08:15.12
Whenever he's around you put on the rock the correct military issued once but you have a little quote here

2370
03:08:15.12 --> 03:08:16.72
It's as cooperate graduate

2371
03:08:16.72 --> 03:08:20.72
Roger and you know, I just wrote next to that play the game and it's like you know

2372
03:08:21.36 --> 03:08:26.32
Some people they want to let their ego get in the way and sometimes you got to put your ego in check and just play the game

2373
03:08:26.64 --> 03:08:31.68
Just cooperate play the little stupid one worried that sunglasses cool and the thing was during the the pre-training

2374
03:08:31.68 --> 03:08:37.28
We had I worn the issued ones and I had sunburn my eyes which is painful if you have that experience

2375
03:08:37.36 --> 03:08:38.96
So first thing I did not sunburn

2376
03:08:38.96 --> 03:08:40.96
It's brutal they close up

2377
03:08:40.96 --> 03:08:45.84
So it's happening when you were skiing yeah the pre-trained up to the course we went up to the mountains and in course in

2378
03:08:45.84 --> 03:08:47.12
Corsica and

2379
03:08:47.12 --> 03:08:52.64
Versio they have like a the rep has a shallow there for training and I had done exactly that it it

2380
03:08:52.64 --> 03:08:57.92
Rain so all the snow on the mountain was ice so it reflected the sun the next day and

2381
03:08:58.16 --> 03:09:02.72
What you would go right through the glasses or underneath so you're somebody the flash the snow

2382
03:09:02.72 --> 03:09:07.04
Rocks are actually actually I've the eyeball the iris and basically just closes up. It's painful

2383
03:09:07.04 --> 03:09:11.12
It's it's not much fun hence my acquisition of the best glasses possible right away

2384
03:09:11.20 --> 03:09:13.84
Which were what just your civilian just some nice

2385
03:09:13.84 --> 03:09:17.68
Yeah, you be blocked by the wall block from leftovers from the M.M. Food you know

2386
03:09:18.56 --> 03:09:20.56
As military issue tech stuff is and

2387
03:09:21.20 --> 03:09:24.56
Yeah, so I had those on and he was like it those are military issues so I just

2388
03:09:25.52 --> 03:09:27.20
Play the game when he was around. I would yeah

2389
03:09:28.40 --> 03:09:30.40
Anyway

2390
03:09:30.40 --> 03:09:32.40
It wasn't vain it was it was more

2391
03:09:32.72 --> 03:09:34.40
Effectiveness of the glasses

2392
03:09:34.40 --> 03:09:35.68
Yeah, well after

2393
03:09:35.68 --> 03:09:42.48
I think they look better to the left strip of course, but just we give me sunburned eyes like I'm not wanting that no snow blind

2394
03:09:43.76 --> 03:09:46.16
So here we go we're rolling now into

2395
03:09:47.36 --> 03:09:52.64
Into the DRock right the Republic of Congo that we're going yep correct

2396
03:09:52.64 --> 03:09:55.68
Braswell here we call that the DRock

2397
03:09:57.20 --> 03:10:02.88
As a step-up the ramp I noticed that the airport tower and terminal were stippled with impacts of different

2398
03:10:02.88 --> 03:10:04.88
Calibers from recent fighting

2399
03:10:06.40 --> 03:10:08.40
President

2400
03:10:09.04 --> 03:10:11.04
President Dennis Sasu Nguoso

2401
03:10:12.40 --> 03:10:16.56
his paramilitary group referred to as the cobras

2402
03:10:18.32 --> 03:10:23.52
Controlled certain neighborhoods within the city as well as the airport other areas were controlled by groups with similar

2403
03:10:23.52 --> 03:10:27.12
Early absurd names like the ninjas or the ramboats

2404
03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.72
But they were no joke life here was cheap and these groups had been all been involved in

2405
03:10:32.72 --> 03:10:37.92
Combat and numerous atrocities as we approach the city center smithy pointed out

2406
03:10:38.56 --> 03:10:43.28
The buildings used by the Congolese Army as firing positions during the ambush

2407
03:10:44.48 --> 03:10:48.48
He showed us the exact area where jails had been killed

2408
03:10:50.96 --> 03:10:55.52
I could feel the weight of that sections history among my teammates many of whom had been there that day

2409
03:10:55.52 --> 03:11:03.44
We entered the empoco neighborhood where the presidential palace and government buildings were located and the area

2410
03:11:03.84 --> 03:11:08.32
Most heavily affected by the recent fighting and poco was a ghost town

2411
03:11:08.72 --> 03:11:14.08
We will varway between scorched a bit scorching abandoned vehicles alongside burned-out houses

2412
03:11:17.12 --> 03:11:19.52
My first so now you guys are doing like

2413
03:11:19.52 --> 03:11:21.52
Um

2414
03:11:22.64 --> 03:11:29.04
Some duty my first guard shift was that evening armed with my famos and VG's webbing at small loss back

2415
03:11:29.04 --> 03:11:34.24
I made the short walk by my observation bunker on the perimeter or two my observation bunker on the perimeter as well

2416
03:11:34.24 --> 03:11:38.64
I was already sweating from the humidity days prior we had been freezing in the alps tonight

2417
03:11:38.64 --> 03:11:40.64
We were roasting in the Congo

2418
03:11:41.20 --> 03:11:46.24
Gunfire within a couple hundred meters of me caught my full attention. I heard a crack in a thump of the bullet

2419
03:11:46.24 --> 03:11:52.000
There was some shouting then silence nothing came of it. This was additional background noise you got used to

2420
03:11:52.56 --> 03:11:59.60
I watched the shadows listening and trying to get a feeling for my surroundings then came another sudden explosion of noise

2421
03:12:00.24 --> 03:12:03.28
Something had hit the OP roof above me hard

2422
03:12:03.84 --> 03:12:08.40
immediately my heart rate went well past the red line into transit

2423
03:12:09.84 --> 03:12:13.52
I instinctively ducked down and took off took my

2424
03:12:13.52 --> 03:12:17.68
Famous off safety what the fuck was that as I tried to figure out what had just happened

2425
03:12:17.68 --> 03:12:20.16
I heard something heavy rolling on the tin roof above me

2426
03:12:20.96 --> 03:12:27.36
The softball size object dropped off the ledge with a dull foot. I immediately realized what it was

2427
03:12:28.64 --> 03:12:31.28
a ripe mango that had fallen from the tree above

2428
03:12:32.24 --> 03:12:35.44
Many more mango alerts followed but I kept my cool

2429
03:12:37.44 --> 03:12:38.48
Uh

2430
03:12:38.48 --> 03:12:41.92
And actually you actually mentioned on there that when the next guy came to turn over

2431
03:12:41.92 --> 03:12:43.92
Let it tell if it was a rough effect

2432
03:12:46.24 --> 03:12:48.24
Let him join the experience

2433
03:12:49.36 --> 03:12:51.36
Our captain was

2434
03:12:51.36 --> 03:12:56.16
talking about a little about your leadership here our captain was more flight than flight. That's how I felt anyway

2435
03:12:56.72 --> 03:13:00.32
It was his attitude. This is a new story. This is a new officer. Yep. Yeah

2436
03:13:01.84 --> 03:13:07.12
If we thought of ourselves as a leap we should act it. I looked at soldiering as a combination of aptitude and the

2437
03:13:07.12 --> 03:13:13.84
Access to the right training but most importantly ones attitude when when getting thrown into into the shit

2438
03:13:14.16 --> 03:13:20.56
Reaction comes down to a fight or flight instinct. I believe we're born with that. It's not taught

2439
03:13:20.56 --> 03:13:25.44
But it is refined with training just because I can run 30 kilometers with a backpack

2440
03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:31.92
Backpack doesn't mean I'm a better soldier than the next guy or vice versa a soldier prepares for the fight

2441
03:13:32.64 --> 03:13:34.64
And it doesn't stop

2442
03:13:34.64 --> 03:13:36.64
Um

2443
03:13:38.72 --> 03:13:41.76
Continuing this guard duty. I was partnered with

2444
03:13:42.16 --> 03:13:44.16
Sergeant Chief Dilashapel

2445
03:13:44.96 --> 03:13:52.64
Who might found to be smart and very easy going his father in fact had spent time in a military prison for his part in the Algerian push

2446
03:13:53.44 --> 03:13:54.64
Pooch

2447
03:13:54.64 --> 03:13:56.64
I turn 28

2448
03:13:57.28 --> 03:14:01.28
There's no cake or celebration just more guard duty and maybe the runs

2449
03:14:01.28 --> 03:14:03.28
Oh yeah

2450
03:14:03.84 --> 03:14:09.04
When our three months in Brazville were up a replacement team arrived but several months later we returned the same job

2451
03:14:09.76 --> 03:14:15.44
This time though the reins had transformed the city into a lush mix of vegetation the neighborhood around the

2452
03:14:16.16 --> 03:14:17.76
Cassada Gawl

2453
03:14:17.76 --> 03:14:24.08
had been clean of rubble and garbage as we drove down the road. I saw that shops and bars had sprung up a long side

2454
03:14:24.08 --> 03:14:29.92
Brazville was alive once more people were drinking and listening to loud music soccer fields were full of kids and adults playing

2455
03:14:29.92 --> 03:14:34.88
What a difference a few months of relative calm in the city make these were happier times

2456
03:14:36.96 --> 03:14:41.76
We the monotony so now you're on this deployment. There's much more peaceful with the monotony physical activity

2457
03:14:41.76 --> 03:14:44.64
He was the only way for us to keep saying and burn off plenty of negative energy

2458
03:14:45.12 --> 03:14:52.000
Ursa who had been become a good friend boxed prior to joining Legion and he was my coach and sparring partner for the duration of the tour

2459
03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.000
So you're getting your boxing on

2460
03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:03.20
Brazville stabilized and we were free to visit the city when we weren't on duty. Ursa, Smitty, Smitty and I took that opportunity

2461
03:15:04.24 --> 03:15:07.28
one evening as everyone did and

2462
03:15:09.20 --> 03:15:13.20
Again, you talk about what what what young men do

2463
03:15:14.56 --> 03:15:20.80
As with most short-term remedies alcohol in these nighttime diversions led to problems sergeant prejent

2464
03:15:20.80 --> 03:15:26.16
While returning from town late one evening made a condescending comment to say lick

2465
03:15:26.80 --> 03:15:30.32
to Salak who's on guard duty at breakfast the following morning

2466
03:15:31.36 --> 03:15:36.48
Prejints black eye was a topic of great discussion. It wasn't long before cap martin warned all of us

2467
03:15:36.88 --> 03:15:42.40
That if something like this happened again both participants were being flown back to Calvary and charged regardless of who is at fault

2468
03:15:42.80 --> 03:15:45.28
This made me start to consider my life long term

2469
03:15:45.28 --> 03:15:50.48
30 years of age was just around the corner did I want to be a Legioner for the better part of it

2470
03:15:50.88 --> 03:15:56.56
I wasn't convinced that I did to Russian made mill 24 hind gun ships

2471
03:15:57.20 --> 03:16:03.20
Hired by the local government had flown and flown by foreign pilots appeared over the Casabagal every few days

2472
03:16:03.84 --> 03:16:10.80
I always made an effort to get out of the grass field and watch them fly over the upper portions of the fuselage were painted in jungle camo

2473
03:16:10.80 --> 03:16:18.80
The underbelly was light blue and they made a hell of a racket one afternoon as I stood looking up at one fly over the low level

2474
03:16:18.80 --> 03:16:21.60
I thought to myself I want to fly helicopters

2475
03:16:22.32 --> 03:16:27.28
I'll last month passed without further fistacuffs and we were eventually replaced for me

2476
03:16:28.08 --> 03:16:30.08
It could have happened soon enough

2477
03:16:33.44 --> 03:16:35.28
And then you're on leave you're snowboarding

2478
03:16:35.28 --> 03:16:41.68
Now you start planning my Legion exit strategy. I completed the administrative application

2479
03:16:42.08 --> 03:16:47.12
Process for the Vancouver Island helicopters flight training program in Victoria British Columbia

2480
03:16:47.12 --> 03:16:53.76
So that lasts trip down there you're feeling like you're done. Yeah, I think I can see the repetitive type

2481
03:16:54.88 --> 03:17:00.80
You start looking at your peers at the job. I could see that it was become repetitive the lack of

2482
03:17:00.80 --> 03:17:04.40
Actress is obviously having its effects that other guys are

2483
03:17:05.36 --> 03:17:06.96
Getting on each other's case

2484
03:17:07.20 --> 03:17:14.000
Do I want to be an NCO is that something that I want to do with the rest of my life because you can see your peers what you know what they're gonna go through and basically you can see your

2485
03:17:14.56 --> 03:17:19.36
Your career in front of you just watching the other guys and I figured that at that at that age

2486
03:17:19.84 --> 03:17:22.88
It was time to make a choice. I was still young enough

2487
03:17:23.60 --> 03:17:25.12
to make a change

2488
03:17:25.12 --> 03:17:26.40
but

2489
03:17:26.40 --> 03:17:29.84
You know getting on that I need to do so sooner than later

2490
03:17:29.84 --> 03:17:32.72
So I made the made the call. What was that term you told me earlier about

2491
03:17:33.68 --> 03:17:39.28
Someone that's unfit for return to civilian yeah, you know, see you so what is that translate to directly?

2492
03:17:39.28 --> 03:17:44.96
It would be incapable of civilian life so if you say basically spend too much time in the system

2493
03:17:45.20 --> 03:17:47.20
You just will survive out in

2494
03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:51.44
Civilian world institutional. Yeah institutionally it's exactly so

2495
03:17:52.24 --> 03:17:54.32
You know at that point I'm about coming up in six years

2496
03:17:54.96 --> 03:17:59.12
I have options. That's I'm lucky. You know I'm Canadian. I can go home. There's lots of lots of stuff

2497
03:17:59.12 --> 03:18:01.12
What's the retirement for

2498
03:18:01.12 --> 03:18:03.12
It was 15 years

2499
03:18:03.12 --> 03:18:08.32
It's not a huge chunk of money and yourself to work after that and that's definitely not a factor

2500
03:18:09.20 --> 03:18:14.40
Even after eight years. I think you recover all your taxes that you paid into the system so you get a chunk of change

2501
03:18:15.20 --> 03:18:19.52
They had offered me to go down to Jebudi to be an instructor on their art applyers

2502
03:18:19.76 --> 03:18:21.76
Command of course which was tempting

2503
03:18:22.40 --> 03:18:23.28
But

2504
03:18:23.28 --> 03:18:26.16
I knew he was tempting well I mean bro

2505
03:18:26.16 --> 03:18:31.52
Yeah, no fair one, but you know it was but that would have got me to the eight years so I would have had a chunk of money

2506
03:18:31.76 --> 03:18:37.60
Which would have helped with the flight train it's instructor duty which I'm sure is I would actually exactly but at that point I had made my mind up and

2507
03:18:38.24 --> 03:18:40.24
Offer I was I was out

2508
03:18:40.24 --> 03:18:42.72
Which was tough you feel like you know you're

2509
03:18:43.44 --> 03:18:47.60
They've put the time and effort I as I mentioned you know they obviously get you trained up a time and effort and

2510
03:18:47.60 --> 03:18:52.64
You got friends you got friends. Yeah, you feel like I'm a woman out on a guy's at her count on you

2511
03:18:52.88 --> 03:18:53.92
But

2512
03:18:53.92 --> 03:18:56.88
There's life to more to more to life than than that

2513
03:18:58.56 --> 03:19:02.40
Yeah, there is kind of crazy it's kind of hard to see that when you're in

2514
03:19:03.68 --> 03:19:05.28
You are doing a

2515
03:19:05.68 --> 03:19:11.04
Demonstration jump on camera room day and your parents were actually there and

2516
03:19:11.92 --> 03:19:16.000
I wanted to bring this point up because that evening you you go for like a dinner and

2517
03:19:17.12 --> 03:19:22.24
There's a lot of veterans there and you say this the veteran Legionnaires are the Indo-China and Algeria campaigns

2518
03:19:22.24 --> 03:19:32.88
In post-second World War France German POWs were given the option of joining the Legion and this influx had far reaching influences on the organization to this day

2519
03:19:33.44 --> 03:19:36.56
Reps second company song is the former vermark

2520
03:19:37.20 --> 03:19:39.20
Marching song Adlevice

2521
03:19:39.60 --> 03:19:44.88
It was sung several times during the night and brought up emotions for our veteran guests

2522
03:19:45.68 --> 03:19:51.60
During the evening some of them shared their experiences recounting past exploits and vivid detail others just listened content to sit

2523
03:19:51.60 --> 03:19:54.16
Among fellow Legionnaires paratroopers again

2524
03:19:54.96 --> 03:19:58.32
As German paratrooper major Rudolph Bulmer said

2525
03:19:58.80 --> 03:20:05.28
The secret of a paratrooper success can be summed up in three words comradeship a spree decor and efficiency

2526
03:20:07.52 --> 03:20:10.56
Yeah, those are the real Legionnaires in the China Algeria

2527
03:20:11.52 --> 03:20:16.40
Previously obviously yeah, I'm like tough tough guys so yeah, and yeah, some of them

2528
03:20:17.04 --> 03:20:20.96
We're just happy to be monks peers again and not say much and enjoy their wine or whatever

2529
03:20:20.96 --> 03:20:26.64
Others would share stories but I definitely respected the history. Yeah, that's just the fact that

2530
03:20:27.28 --> 03:20:34.96
Post-second World War II German POWs are meant that fought to the death or almost to the death against France

2531
03:20:36.32 --> 03:20:41.92
And now they're getting told up yep if you want to join the Legion come on over exactly and there's a lot of wordage for example

2532
03:20:41.92 --> 03:20:43.92
Octong is used all the time

2533
03:20:43.92 --> 03:20:46.24
Yeah, there's tons of German words that are in the

2534
03:20:46.24 --> 03:20:53.60
Legion vernacular and all that you use and that's from them. Yeah, that's neat and they had you know obviously good soldiers

2535
03:20:53.60 --> 03:20:56.32
So they brought them with them a lot of good tools

2536
03:20:57.04 --> 03:20:59.04
Yeah, sure

2537
03:20:59.04 --> 03:21:02.000
You go on here. I passed before captain Desmoulet

2538
03:21:02.56 --> 03:21:06.72
Not long afterwards and was asked if I was resigning. I needed to confirm yes or no

2539
03:21:06.96 --> 03:21:11.92
I do we informed captain Desmoulet that I wasn't extending past the six-year mark

2540
03:21:11.92 --> 03:21:16.24
I had given a lot of thought and I told him that I had applied to be a Canadian helicopter

2541
03:21:17.52 --> 03:21:22.56
I applied to a Canadian helicopter flight training program and that I've been accepted which was true

2542
03:21:22.80 --> 03:21:27.20
Six years in the Legion wasn't something you just walk away from easily nevertheless

2543
03:21:27.44 --> 03:21:34.000
I felt I needed to move on and then he told the company captain the same thing and he's the one that offered you the commando course

2544
03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:41.60
Correct, which you didn't expect but standing in that office my kept me at my side my pole to move on was stronger

2545
03:21:42.16 --> 03:21:48.24
I was almost 29 and at a crossroads. I respectfully declined the captain accepted my choice

2546
03:21:50.16 --> 03:21:54.72
It had to move he went on to lead the regiment when they jumped into Mali

2547
03:21:54.72 --> 03:21:58.40
Oh wow Timbuck to don't go and wrote the Ford on the book

2548
03:21:58.40 --> 03:22:04.24
Which gives it it's legit. You'll be a general here. He's doing a reason. That's on the right track. Yeah

2549
03:22:04.72 --> 03:22:07.12
We have to have him on the podcast at some point. There you go

2550
03:22:09.68 --> 03:22:14.08
Continuing on again jumping for a little bit of his time to close this chapter on my life in the Legion

2551
03:22:14.08 --> 03:22:18.40
The following morning this is after you kind of got back and you're getting psychled out the following morning as

2552
03:22:18.40 --> 03:22:21.28
Promo orders I passed before captain Desmoulet

2553
03:22:21.60 --> 03:22:24.56
So am I saying that right? Demo Demo and

2554
03:22:24.56 --> 03:22:31.12
My thought I was nailing it to close I threw it like a little something on it. I thought I was doing all right

2555
03:22:31.36 --> 03:22:33.36
Not even close. Demu and

2556
03:22:33.84 --> 03:22:39.12
He gave me a GCP section plaque and wish me good luck. I said goodbye to my teammates and wish them a safe

2557
03:22:39.12 --> 03:22:42.000
But operational future. That's a freaking great line

2558
03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.56
I wish them a safe but operational future

2559
03:22:44.96 --> 03:22:49.44
If I like I was betraying them somewhat, but everyone has to make choices and I made mine

2560
03:22:49.44 --> 03:22:54.08
I boarded the ferry in Bastia on August 31st

2561
03:22:54.56 --> 03:22:56.32
2000 leaving behind Corsica

2562
03:22:56.88 --> 03:23:01.12
It had been my home for five years. I'd miss it in the days. I spent swimming along its beaches

2563
03:23:01.36 --> 03:23:04.24
Hiking and running in the wooded trails skiing the carved mountains

2564
03:23:04.72 --> 03:23:08.24
Driving the narrow roads and embracing Corsica's unique approach to life

2565
03:23:08.56 --> 03:23:10.80
It was a place I wouldn't forget anytime soon

2566
03:23:13.60 --> 03:23:19.20
Arriving where my journey had started six years ago as a younger man with less with a less

2567
03:23:19.20 --> 03:23:24.96
worldly outlook and experience. I joined a group of 25 other legionaires from various regiments

2568
03:23:25.68 --> 03:23:27.20
They were also going

2569
03:23:27.20 --> 03:23:33.12
Civil in a few days. We were subjected to final medical and more administrative protocols before presenting

2570
03:23:33.12 --> 03:23:38.000
ourselves in the offices of a Colonel. He asked if I was certain about my decision to leave the legion

2571
03:23:38.56 --> 03:23:42.56
It felt like a lifetime ago that I stood in front of that white washed three-story building

2572
03:23:42.56 --> 03:23:50.72
Steering at the words Lazyopotria, Nostra. Well, not September day in 1994, almost six years ago

2573
03:23:51.20 --> 03:23:57.60
My hand hovered over the push button doorbell as I hesitated unsure if I could commit to what lay ahead

2574
03:23:57.84 --> 03:24:00.000
Today, however, my resolve was firm

2575
03:24:01.28 --> 03:24:07.36
And then you go forward that day finally arrived one by one. We entered the office of the legions commanding on commanding general

2576
03:24:07.36 --> 03:24:14.16
And presented ourselves his office was quite large so most of the time was spent walking to and from the spot where we were to present ourselves

2577
03:24:14.56 --> 03:24:19.84
It was a quick yes or no sir affair the commanding general wished me good luck and that was it

2578
03:24:20.48 --> 03:24:24.72
Our group was taken to the Legion Museum to see Captain Dan Hughes

2579
03:24:24.88 --> 03:24:32.64
So that right don't you don't use wooden hand and you tell that story. It's a great story about Captain Dan's you and his wooden hand and

2580
03:24:32.64 --> 03:24:40.88
It's historical significance and we finished up by joining the general for a group photo in front of the monument for the dead

2581
03:24:42.32 --> 03:24:48.48
When I got back to the barracks, I took off my uniform for the very last time and changed into my civilian clothes with my bags packed

2582
03:24:48.72 --> 03:24:51.68
I walked the regiment walked to the regiment's front gate

2583
03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:55.20
Perhaps a little faster than normal. I had a train to catch

2584
03:24:55.20 --> 03:25:04.64
I presented my authorization slip to the duty sergeant at the front gate looked down at my new light blue nikes and walked outside

2585
03:25:05.68 --> 03:25:08.08
I was a civilian once again

2586
03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.72
Boom boom that's a rap. That's a rap

2587
03:25:14.56 --> 03:25:19.60
You uh I thought that was a rap when I read I was like I was like okay, that's a good place to end the podcast

2588
03:25:19.60 --> 03:25:21.60
But I actually I got to go a little bit more

2589
03:25:21.60 --> 03:25:27.12
Um, I mean there's more yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but that is that is that is a rap. I mean obviously

2590
03:25:27.12 --> 03:25:31.68
That's a rap on a huge part of your life and something that's left a huge impact on you

2591
03:25:32.64 --> 03:25:41.84
I always remember cleaning out the final bits of my operational gear from my locker loading it into my van and driving off base for the last time and thinking well

2592
03:25:41.84 --> 03:25:46.88
That was a stuff and I spent well kind of like you spent six years based out of course

2593
03:25:46.88 --> 03:25:51.68
I spent 18 out of 20 years based in corn auto California and really probably

2594
03:25:53.52 --> 03:25:59.68
Most of those years in like a span of like three or four buildings that were all right next to each other

2595
03:25:59.68 --> 03:26:04.32
So a vast majority of my career was in these three or four buildings and that's where I checked out of and left

2596
03:26:05.44 --> 03:26:07.44
Not easy to do no

2597
03:26:07.76 --> 03:26:13.20
Um, and thank you for your service by the way you mentioned on the card. No, that was a that was an honor

2598
03:26:13.20 --> 03:26:15.20
Um

2599
03:26:15.44 --> 03:26:22.000
Here you say before I return to Canada. I needed to pay my respects after several hours on the train and a short taxi ride ride

2600
03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:23.36
I arrived in the village of

2601
03:26:23.36 --> 03:26:25.36
Riviers

2602
03:26:26.56 --> 03:26:28.08
Approved approved

2603
03:26:28.08 --> 03:26:29.84
Here I walked the length

2604
03:26:30.08 --> 03:26:33.20
249 headstones at the Canadian war cemetery

2605
03:26:33.20 --> 03:26:37.36
We're Canadian soldiers who fell at Normandy had been laid to rest on its rolling hills

2606
03:26:37.36 --> 03:26:40.96
I looked at the soldiers names and ages and was humbled by their sacrifice

2607
03:26:40.96 --> 03:26:46.48
I then walked along Juno Beach where my paternal grandfather landed on June 6th

2608
03:26:46.88 --> 03:26:48.48
1944 D-Day

2609
03:26:49.20 --> 03:26:54.80
Not far away was sword beach where my maternal grandfather drove his Sherman tank

2610
03:26:56.000 --> 03:27:00.000
Off the boat only a few days later on that day more than a half a century later

2611
03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:03.92
I was probably the never of my family's military heritage and Canadian history

2612
03:27:04.56 --> 03:27:06.40
On my flight back to Canada

2613
03:27:06.40 --> 03:27:13.60
I wasn't celebrating my return home my future was uncertain but the legions system D

2614
03:27:15.04 --> 03:27:19.68
And that's that stands for a demared demared which means shit, right?

2615
03:27:21.28 --> 03:27:26.64
Meredith shit, they married is more like figured out. Yeah, that okay, so married means shit

2616
03:27:26.64 --> 03:27:30.48
Yeah, and de-married means it's basically work shit out correct

2617
03:27:31.76 --> 03:27:34.72
Within weeks I started flight training in Victoria, British Columbia

2618
03:27:34.72 --> 03:27:40.000
Adjusting civilian life took time. There were no more whistles or night jumps over the med over Mediterranean island

2619
03:27:40.24 --> 03:27:44.56
The uncertainty of employment and novelty of paying bills were my new reality

2620
03:27:45.60 --> 03:27:48.40
You must save a lot of money in the legions since you don't have to pay for anything

2621
03:27:48.40 --> 03:27:51.52
No, I think you probably take advantage of your time off and spend more than

2622
03:27:52.08 --> 03:27:57.44
God, you're just the richest man, but I did I had enough I sent money home my dad was wise enough to

2623
03:27:57.44 --> 03:28:06.56
Help me and invested and it paid for my helicopter training which was a chunk. So yeah, I was able to

2624
03:28:04.72 --> 03:28:08.48
Finance the exit stretch another good section here

2625
03:28:08.96 --> 03:28:13.68
Talk about your grandfather. I didn't ask my grandfather enough about his experience at the time

2626
03:28:13.68 --> 03:28:17.60
I felt that he would share more if you really wanted to discuss these things sadly

2627
03:28:17.60 --> 03:28:20.80
He passed and my hero was lost and his memoir

2628
03:28:21.04 --> 03:28:26.000
Entired entitled an amateur soldier my grandfather doesn't say much about den bmp

2629
03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:33.52
However, he wrote any kind of flying in 1954 was a novel to me, but first class on an air France was something else again

2630
03:28:34.32 --> 03:28:41.36
I was served a hot toddy of brandy and milk by a super sturdist and delicious meals are things I long remember

2631
03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:45.68
I guess that after years of war your immediate priorities change

2632
03:28:46.16 --> 03:28:49.36
Why focus on the negatives my grandfather also wrote

2633
03:28:49.92 --> 03:28:55.68
People often ask veterans at what feelings they have when they know that they survived the horrors of a

2634
03:28:55.68 --> 03:28:57.68
dreadful war

2635
03:28:57.68 --> 03:29:01.84
Surprisingly enough a good many answer a sense of guilt

2636
03:29:03.44 --> 03:29:05.44
Roger

2637
03:29:05.44 --> 03:29:07.92
Yeah, can I comment on?

2638
03:29:07.92 --> 03:29:09.44
Absolutely so

2639
03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:16.40
Before going to the Legion obviously I'd seen pictures of the rep jumping in indembi and food which is where the regiment the rep was

2640
03:29:16.40 --> 03:29:18.40
Decimated or the precursor to the rep

2641
03:29:20.56 --> 03:29:24.56
And those you know that history those pictures were something that were definitely a big part of me joining

2642
03:29:24.56 --> 03:29:29.52
When I was going to flight school and I would go and have lunch heard dinner with my grandparents

2643
03:29:29.92 --> 03:29:32.16
He mentioned that he had flown into the demmen who

2644
03:29:32.96 --> 03:29:38.16
But a week after the capitulation of the French and he was there as a two-i-c for the precursor to the UN

2645
03:29:38.88 --> 03:29:40.88
So that blew me away that

2646
03:29:40.88 --> 03:29:46.32
I don't there's a connection there, but just the fact that you know I was taken by the mnf who I go and serve in the French one legion

2647
03:29:46.32 --> 03:29:50.56
And my grandfather had actually been there you know week after the war at end or the

2648
03:29:50.56 --> 03:29:54.24
That particular battle it ended and not just for whatever reason that just

2649
03:29:55.28 --> 03:29:57.28
Really hit home

2650
03:29:57.84 --> 03:30:00.08
I don't know if that was it meant anything but it was just

2651
03:30:00.88 --> 03:30:02.88
It was a big part of

2652
03:30:03.04 --> 03:30:05.52
Yeah, let me think about what he

2653
03:30:06.24 --> 03:30:09.84
fought yeah, was I knew going to join the rep and the

2654
03:30:10.56 --> 03:30:12.16
And he knew that they had been

2655
03:30:12.48 --> 03:30:18.32
Desmated so at the beginning he was you know a wise maiden say much you just said if you go there make sure you go on for the right reasons and

2656
03:30:18.32 --> 03:30:20.32
And

2657
03:30:20.32 --> 03:30:24.40
Represent your country well, but he didn't go into because he did have some some ideas on the

2658
03:30:25.20 --> 03:30:27.68
On the what the legion was based on his experience at the mnf who

2659
03:30:28.64 --> 03:30:32.80
And then when I was you mentioned that was writing letters those letters were going to him when I was in

2660
03:30:33.44 --> 03:30:40.48
Central Africa at the end he as I did learn more about the legion and respect it a little more and got a better picture of what I was doing

2661
03:30:40.48 --> 03:30:46.24
So as a result he was more open about some of his experiences during the war as he felt that

2662
03:30:46.24 --> 03:30:51.28
I think is my small taste albeit nowhere near what my grandfather experience but I had that small taste of

2663
03:30:51.84 --> 03:30:58.72
As a soldier can you can talk to another soldier when you we've been similar scenarios so did he tell you more about world war two once you came back

2664
03:30:58.72 --> 03:31:00.000
He did

2665
03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:02.000
Not much detail

2666
03:31:02.56 --> 03:31:08.64
And how about his book his book yeah, so he was doing his he was actually doing his degree in history and writing his memoirs and

2667
03:31:08.64 --> 03:31:15.04
And to mention there he hadn't can you give me a copy by all means 100% yeah, I'm also I have it

2668
03:31:15.60 --> 03:31:17.76
All chippity if you want and if you promised to

2669
03:31:18.48 --> 03:31:20.48
Sure you will set it back

2670
03:31:20.48 --> 03:31:24.80
Is that few copies? Yeah, unless I could probably figure something else, but if you want I can strip you my

2671
03:31:25.44 --> 03:31:27.28
Anyway, oh, we'll get a figure it out figure it out

2672
03:31:28.24 --> 03:31:31.52
He he hadn't kept a guard or in when he was writing his memoirs

2673
03:31:31.52 --> 03:31:36.000
He said to me, Joff any advice just write down your memories now. Obviously, we don't you'll regret it

2674
03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:38.72
So I took him up on that and that's when I wrote everything down

2675
03:31:39.12 --> 03:31:40.88
Yeah, that's how you get dates

2676
03:31:40.88 --> 03:31:46.56
Yeah, dates about this book and accurate exactly and there was obviously more after the fact you know the research and

2677
03:31:47.12 --> 03:31:49.52
Friends helping and then getting all the information

2678
03:31:49.52 --> 03:31:54.72
I needed but he he was the precursor to me putting this story to the paper and it sat for a decade

2679
03:31:54.72 --> 03:31:57.20
Like it was 150,000 words on a word document

2680
03:31:57.36 --> 03:32:00.72
No respect for the English language or punctuation or anything. It was just raw

2681
03:32:00.72 --> 03:32:08.64
Verbal diarrhea and over you know the decade with aging experience and you know things came up

2682
03:32:09.28 --> 03:32:13.20
My perspective changed and nothing came out that was representative of a legion area

2683
03:32:13.60 --> 03:32:17.04
Since legion error and I kept them waiting and then I thought hey, maybe it's on me

2684
03:32:18.16 --> 03:32:23.20
So I started putting in the the time and effort to work on the story and it took a chunk of time

2685
03:32:23.20 --> 03:32:28.88
But I'm proud of the the end result and the fact that the legion approved its

2686
03:32:28.88 --> 03:32:34.56
Narrative yeah, I have a forward from obviously my former commanding officer, which is a first for a book of its type

2687
03:32:34.80 --> 03:32:39.28
It gives it its legion and the messy and then the fact that welfare lawry was able to or willing to

2688
03:32:39.60 --> 03:32:46.72
The public shit that was too factors. I needed I needed the leases background or the backing and then a respectable publisher to give it that

2689
03:32:47.12 --> 03:32:51.20
Because then I knew that it was a good story if welfare lawry was willing to put their name on it

2690
03:32:51.20 --> 03:32:53.60
I knew that it was it was sound and I had help

2691
03:32:54.88 --> 03:32:56.88
I'm a soldier not a

2692
03:32:56.88 --> 03:33:00.88
So they well came out great. I mean, that's a fantastic book

2693
03:33:03.60 --> 03:33:10.000
Yeah, you continue on a little bit here flying helicopters commercially meant that initially limited opportunities were afforded to low-time pilots

2694
03:33:10.32 --> 03:33:12.80
Along with low wages so in slower winter seasons

2695
03:33:12.80 --> 03:33:17.12
I work as security contractor for a British forum based in London, England supporting exploration

2696
03:33:17.60 --> 03:33:21.76
Efforts in North Africa and later government contracts and I rack an African stand

2697
03:33:21.76 --> 03:33:28.32
So you went on the contractor circuit for a while too. I did yeah, yeah, that had to be

2698
03:33:28.96 --> 03:33:36.08
Interesting as well many legionnaires not a ton the Algeria stuff. Yeah, armor group. They no longer use this their bought-out by G4S

2699
03:33:36.88 --> 03:33:40.24
But they would hire a lot of ex-legionnaires because of the obviously the French the English

2700
03:33:40.88 --> 03:33:44.48
Supporting Halliburne oil had quite a few regs in in Algeria

2701
03:33:45.04 --> 03:33:49.76
So you'd be there as an operation Lee is all coordinator basically just the rigs because of the terror

2702
03:33:49.76 --> 03:33:55.92
Misissue in Algeria they would be secured by the Algerian army so you'd just be the liaison between the army and the client

2703
03:33:57.28 --> 03:33:59.04
So that was about it, but when Iraq kicked off

2704
03:33:59.76 --> 03:34:04.000
It was more an interest in seeing what else how else things were done

2705
03:34:05.04 --> 03:34:07.28
That was the the interest going there. What years were you there?

2706
03:34:07.92 --> 03:34:12.32
It was late or really early 2004 so it was fresh just when

2707
03:34:12.96 --> 03:34:15.36
So when you were there yeah, so initially it was

2708
03:34:15.36 --> 03:34:19.76
Kellibrande Root had gotten the because we looked after KBR in Alger

2709
03:34:21.04 --> 03:34:22.96
They're at their part of Haliburn oil

2710
03:34:22.96 --> 03:34:24.08
oil winds wind effect

2711
03:34:24.08 --> 03:34:30.32
Dick Cheney I think that was a see or it they got the logcat contract to build all the bases for the American military in Iraq

2712
03:34:31.04 --> 03:34:36.24
The defects supply all the fuel so we went over there initially we had three floors at the Sheridan

2713
03:34:36.88 --> 03:34:43.60
And we hired whole bunch of local nationals and the idea was to train them up on close protection and then when the executives from

2714
03:34:43.60 --> 03:34:47.44
KBR came in and went to all these different spots we would we would take them

2715
03:34:47.92 --> 03:34:52.64
So that was my initial introduction to and at that point 2004 things were where really

2716
03:34:53.28 --> 03:34:55.92
That busy for people on the ground there was no idea issue

2717
03:34:57.04 --> 03:35:02.88
And then I came back the next year and things were a little busier and baggeded and we're doing low profile PSD

2718
03:35:03.68 --> 03:35:05.68
So at that point

2719
03:35:05.76 --> 03:35:08.80
There was quite a few companies that were a little bit aggressive and they're

2720
03:35:10.16 --> 03:35:12.88
Approach or the rules of engagement and as you know

2721
03:35:12.88 --> 03:35:15.60
Better than I the bathers or the

2722
03:35:16.24 --> 03:35:19.76
There's whatever they were they decided to go after the PSD teams

2723
03:35:20.08 --> 03:35:23.36
So what we were doing is we were doing a low profile PSD so we had just buy local

2724
03:35:25.36 --> 03:35:28.24
Number CDs BMWs and we tried to blend in so it'd be helpful

2725
03:35:28.88 --> 03:35:33.20
Yeah, exactly just try to blend in and they would be two expats and Iraqis and

2726
03:35:34.40 --> 03:35:39.52
We had our DOD badges like we're all and we'd have a nice

2727
03:35:40.08 --> 03:35:42.08
Union jack classified in the

2728
03:35:42.08 --> 03:35:44.08
Front with us and if

2729
03:35:44.08 --> 03:35:47.68
When you're patrols pull that beside us or got for a bit black water or another

2730
03:35:48.24 --> 03:35:52.16
PSD team like that we'd be on the windows right away because if they look down and see in Iraq

2731
03:35:52.16 --> 03:35:59.28
You're with an AK on the left or not a guy's question. So yeah, I did that and then I was up into Crete for a while and then F-Ganis and kicked off and

2732
03:35:59.60 --> 03:36:03.04
I did that for a full year down and and helmet there. What were you doing there?

2733
03:36:03.76 --> 03:36:06.32
There they had again our group got the

2734
03:36:06.32 --> 03:36:13.20
The contract for the British embassy FCO foreign Commonwealth office and the Brits had helmet

2735
03:36:13.20 --> 03:36:18.000
Province so this they sent down an advisor to the governor helmet. So we're embedded with the

2736
03:36:18.56 --> 03:36:21.36
Initially was the the Parage and then the Rome Reigns

2737
03:36:22.32 --> 03:36:28.40
And we just basically we had a small compound within their PRT which is a little base they had in the center of town and then we had a house

2738
03:36:29.28 --> 03:36:31.68
Attached to the governor's compound

2739
03:36:31.68 --> 03:36:37.76
And we just the our client's name was Tom you just take him you had a floor underneath the governor's

2740
03:36:38.64 --> 03:36:42.24
Floor office and basically he's just back and forth taking him already had to go

2741
03:36:42.88 --> 03:36:47.60
We'd fly out to some of the areas sometimes with the Brits. So you know at that point garage was going off

2742
03:36:48.56 --> 03:36:53.68
Sangin so there's a lot of you know efforts going on just figure that out. So I did that for a year

2743
03:36:55.28 --> 03:37:00.32
And I started to yeah, I missed the flying I had been there seen it. It was interesting good experience but

2744
03:37:00.32 --> 03:37:04.24
Kind of felt mad enough and went back to flying full time again

2745
03:37:05.44 --> 03:37:06.72
So

2746
03:37:06.72 --> 03:37:13.60
Actually, I did want to when I read the closing this book I wanted to at least bring it home because I think it's I think it's I think it's awesome

2747
03:37:15.12 --> 03:37:17.44
And so here's what's going on you're in France

2748
03:37:17.92 --> 03:37:19.52
You're with your kids

2749
03:37:19.52 --> 03:37:25.04
You meet with some of your old Legion friends and again. I'm not gonna cover every the detail that you give is great in the book

2750
03:37:26.24 --> 03:37:27.60
But

2751
03:37:27.60 --> 03:37:30.72
You know you they the old Legion friends kind of invite you to

2752
03:37:32.64 --> 03:37:37.84
Yeah, the seal yeah, the seal I invite you to see the regiment in in Calvy and

2753
03:37:38.64 --> 03:37:44.52
So you're gonna drive there with your children and you're thinking you're gonna show them the regiment and it says this

2754
03:37:44.72 --> 03:37:47.52
Driving the final stretch of course goes close to a road

2755
03:37:47.52 --> 03:37:52.64
We descended into Calvy Bay on the same road. I had taken all those years ago as a young Legioner

2756
03:37:52.64 --> 03:38:00.000
After several are we there yets I told my kids shut your mouth and put on your keptis

2757
03:38:01.04 --> 03:38:06.08
Approaching the regiments front gate. I slowed right down looking into its parade square and passing

2758
03:38:06.56 --> 03:38:10.40
The emotions I felt at that exact moment are difficult to explain

2759
03:38:10.56 --> 03:38:16.16
We drove past checked into our Calvy hotel and spent the rest of the day

2760
03:38:16.80 --> 03:38:21.12
Swimming at the beach the next morning after some delicious croissants

2761
03:38:21.12 --> 03:38:25.12
Orange juice and two strong cafe crams for me

2762
03:38:25.76 --> 03:38:28.88
At one of the citadel cafes we drove to the regiment

2763
03:38:29.60 --> 03:38:35.52
Parked outside the regiments gates noting the new rep and Sydney a painted on its water tower

2764
03:38:35.52 --> 03:38:37.52
I asked my kids what they wanted to do

2765
03:38:38.56 --> 03:38:41.76
Visit the regiment or go snorkeling at the beach

2766
03:38:41.76 --> 03:38:49.92
Perhaps they could sense the answer I was looking for the rep was in my past and the regiment was busy doing real work

2767
03:38:51.84 --> 03:38:58.80
My focus now was on my son Carter and daughter Kyle and snorkeling

2768
03:39:01.36 --> 03:39:04.40
Showed to Carter and co long live the Legion

2769
03:39:05.36 --> 03:39:09.04
And that's how you wrap it up and I thought that that was that idea of

2770
03:39:09.04 --> 03:39:14.40
Yeah, long live the Legion but at the same time you got your new focus now

2771
03:39:14.64 --> 03:39:20.24
Which is your son and your daughter and I thought that that's a a lot of people have a hard time doing that

2772
03:39:21.68 --> 03:39:27.04
Shifting their focus from their past to their present and then to their future

2773
03:39:27.52 --> 03:39:30.16
So I thought that that was an awesome way to

2774
03:39:30.56 --> 03:39:33.04
Tie it together and put things in perspective. I appreciate that

2775
03:39:34.08 --> 03:39:36.08
So

2776
03:39:35.68 --> 03:39:36.88
What

2777
03:39:36.88 --> 03:39:38.08
We've been going for a long time

2778
03:39:38.08 --> 03:39:41.76
But but before we we do wrap it up completely

2779
03:39:42.32 --> 03:39:48.000
Let's talk a little bit about what you're up through now. Sure. So I know you got you've got a risk mitigation firm

2780
03:39:48.24 --> 03:39:52.80
Yes, so I flag a helicopter's commercially for a company called Mustang out of Alberta

2781
03:39:52.88 --> 03:39:57.36
So that's my full time and what kind of helicopter flights of those we do firefighting in the summer

2782
03:39:57.92 --> 03:40:02.80
This summer I did repel so the Alberta government has a repel program where they initial attack

2783
03:40:02.80 --> 03:40:04.16
They repelled into the fires

2784
03:40:04.16 --> 03:40:09.84
In fact, they just canceled the but we do that and then winters we helly ski so when I go back

2785
03:40:09.84 --> 03:40:13.96
Oh interesting yeah, so that starts whereabouts is this rebel stoked

2786
03:40:13.96 --> 03:40:21.84
Yeah, we got four to a five and four a stars busy and we do that all year and actually the season started yesterday

2787
03:40:22.24 --> 03:40:26.24
That's what I did my my training last week and when I get home be back into it

2788
03:40:26.96 --> 03:40:30.08
And then yeah, as you mentioned I'm a partner in a risk mitigation company

2789
03:40:30.08 --> 03:40:34.56
Two of the names in the book their partners in the company, but we're just you know a small

2790
03:40:34.56 --> 03:40:39.28
It's a Ravenhill risk control the name is the VC that's in the family and

2791
03:40:40.40 --> 03:40:47.04
George A Raven George a Ravenhill one of eight recipients have the metal taken back to sad story

2792
03:40:47.04 --> 03:40:52.96
It's a definitely he went on you know that's the bore war where he won the VC went on the fight in the first war

2793
03:40:52.96 --> 03:40:59.60
So he's completely awarded the VC word the VC shot through the arm and back then as I mentioned

2794
03:40:59.60 --> 03:41:02.000
He wanted to eight he was came back from the

2795
03:41:02.72 --> 03:41:07.12
Woffley suffered and he was in like a penal regimen for some of his transgressions whenever

2796
03:41:07.68 --> 03:41:13.60
I think he was on the sauce drinking and they weren't paying him is his monthly wage that he felt they were supposed to be and

2797
03:41:13.92 --> 03:41:20.80
He went any stole two pens. I think it was 12 pens worth of steel in Birmingham and it was basically the cell to pay for food for his family

2798
03:41:21.20 --> 03:41:24.24
And he was caught and for that they took the metal back

2799
03:41:24.24 --> 03:41:29.20
He went on to they had to send four of his kids to orphanages and

2800
03:41:29.60 --> 03:41:31.60
U.S. and Canada and he died at my age

2801
03:41:32.40 --> 03:41:34.40
destitute sad story

2802
03:41:34.40 --> 03:41:36.56
But you know a brave braze soldier did his

2803
03:41:36.96 --> 03:41:42.24
Did his thing for his country and paid the pay the price so I used yeah Ravenhill is the name out of respect

2804
03:41:42.24 --> 03:41:45.12
So there's eight people that have had their VC's revoked

2805
03:41:45.60 --> 03:41:51.52
Take him back because all the same they changed no different over time, but some people have had their

2806
03:41:51.52 --> 03:41:53.52
Victorious crosses revoked

2807
03:41:53.52 --> 03:41:56.72
Correct, yeah, if they have they changed that back and give it a back to him now?

2808
03:41:57.12 --> 03:41:58.32
It's in the

2809
03:41:58.32 --> 03:42:01.84
The museum in Birmingham the regiment museum that he was part of they have it

2810
03:42:02.40 --> 03:42:07.60
But they but it's he recognized now. Yeah, as a he's a V-Sitter 100% yeah, he did the DW

2811
03:42:07.60 --> 03:42:09.60
Yeah, of course, obviously

2812
03:42:10.56 --> 03:42:12.80
Okay, and then also you've started off a

2813
03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:16.000
PTSD organization

2814
03:42:16.40 --> 03:42:18.40
Yeah, well, it's yeah, Legion engineered

2815
03:42:18.40 --> 03:42:25.52
It's early days with a next couple months here. He'll be a foundation and the idea is just to sell a parallel online

2816
03:42:26.72 --> 03:42:29.68
To support veteran affairs PTSD type efforts

2817
03:42:30.08 --> 03:42:34.56
Regardless of where the soldiers come from the idea being if there's more sales from the US

2818
03:42:34.56 --> 03:42:39.04
We would send it to veteran affairs program in the US if it was more from the UK, Canada whatever

2819
03:42:39.68 --> 03:42:43.92
But yeah, the efforts more just to get awareness out there. I was recently invited to

2820
03:42:43.92 --> 03:42:48.96
Be the guest speaker at my old regiment the role was spent for regiments of their senior NCO dinner

2821
03:42:49.76 --> 03:42:55.28
And yeah, it seemed like PTSD just ramp it. I don't I don't know what the reason for they had a couple young guys

2822
03:42:55.28 --> 03:43:00.48
I came back from Afghanistan and decided they couldn't take it anymore and shot themselves and I was like, you know

2823
03:43:00.72 --> 03:43:02.72
I was looking for

2824
03:43:02.72 --> 03:43:04.72
Something to do that wasn't just all about

2825
03:43:04.72 --> 03:43:09.04
You know, we have the business, but it's that's about making money. It's just selfish at the end of the day and

2826
03:43:09.04 --> 03:43:14.000
This idea of Legion and Generity had been there for long as I can know what one on I just

2827
03:43:14.88 --> 03:43:18.96
Put those two together, so that's the objective is to build it and hopefully

2828
03:43:19.60 --> 03:43:23.44
You know if it's just a small amount of money, but at least it's something that I can do to give back

2829
03:43:23.84 --> 03:43:31.04
And certainly in all of a CPSDS, it's history in the family, so yeah, that's the objective and that's Legion and Generity dot com that is correct

2830
03:43:31.04 --> 03:43:34.32
And then the other one is Raven Hill risk control

2831
03:43:34.32 --> 03:43:42.08
Ron Hill risk control and we're licensed security company in B.C. Yeah, is that is that only in British companies that

2832
03:43:42.08 --> 03:43:45.28
Well, Canada Canada, but we we're mostly domestic. We support

2833
03:43:46.40 --> 03:43:50.32
Couple projects. There's a company that has a gold mine and we facilitate the movement of gold

2834
03:43:50.72 --> 03:43:51.92
Right to be

2835
03:43:51.92 --> 03:43:56.80
There's an NHL team that uses us when the owners fly over to France for example to go to the

2836
03:43:57.20 --> 03:43:58.56
Cance film festival though

2837
03:43:58.56 --> 03:44:05.12
Will you use us for our networking because we can reach out from guys that we're not during our our courses and say hey, you know

2838
03:44:05.12 --> 03:44:09.68
You interested in working for the couple weeks and so yeah, we have that that ability to reach on

2839
03:44:10.32 --> 03:44:13.76
Network with the people that we've met from our time in which is our success

2840
03:44:14.32 --> 03:44:18.80
Yeah, and then on Instagram is that your main social media?

2841
03:44:19.20 --> 03:44:23.52
You know, I'm I'm new that was a learning curve for the book

2842
03:44:23.52 --> 03:44:25.52
I didn't have a Facebook before I fell

2843
03:44:25.52 --> 03:44:32.48
Yeah, Joel Struters for like a space book and Instagram and then there's at early gen engineering for you

2844
03:44:32.48 --> 03:44:38.16
Absolutely an engineered at Joel Struters correct and what's at a pal

2845
03:44:39.68 --> 03:44:43.28
WL you press yes, so that's just for the book for the character

2846
03:44:44.64 --> 03:44:49.12
Let's focus on at Joel Struters. I that's would be my recommendation. I appreciate it

2847
03:44:49.12 --> 03:44:56.16
Just because you'll write another book or you'll do something else and that that just for the book

2848
03:44:56.16 --> 03:44:58.56
I'll just focus on Joel Struters at Joel Struters

2849
03:44:59.52 --> 03:45:03.84
Eck or you got anything else you still play hockey. I don't you know no

2850
03:45:03.92 --> 03:45:07.60

03:45:11.76 --> 03:45:18.40
I blew up my lateral see okay. Yeah, so I did both of you by the way not doing that though, but my little brother

2853
03:45:18.40 --> 03:45:25.52
Please this football game. We support football. Yeah, please this football game. He's like you know 30 something in which I guess now doesn't seem that old but

2854
03:45:26.24 --> 03:45:30.96
Compared to high school, you know, they're different times but he thinks he's back in the game right?

2855
03:45:30.96 --> 03:45:32.16
Terz is peck

2856
03:45:32.16 --> 03:45:36.48
Yeah, so yeah, man. No, it's a rugby to this bold

2857
03:45:36.96 --> 03:45:41.44
It was boy. It was yeah, not a wise decision. Yeah, man. It taught me pretty quick that

2858
03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:44.000
You're no longer there

2859
03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:50.16
As life does he'll check you right on Joel you got any other final thoughts no sir

2860
03:45:50.88 --> 03:45:52.16
Maybe if

2861
03:45:52.16 --> 03:45:56.88
Final things is some humbled for the opportunity. I obviously have watched your podcast. I seen the guests on here and

2862
03:45:57.36 --> 03:46:00.56
Just to be among some of the names and stories and medals

2863
03:46:01.04 --> 03:46:04.56
That have been in this chair. I'm I'm more than humble

2864
03:46:05.04 --> 03:46:07.04
So I appreciate the opportunity and

2865
03:46:07.44 --> 03:46:09.44
The objective of the book was to educate

2866
03:46:09.68 --> 03:46:12.72
If people are interested in the subject matter and they want to know the truth

2867
03:46:12.72 --> 03:46:14.72
It certainly

2868
03:46:15.12 --> 03:46:17.12
tries to do that for

2869
03:46:17.12 --> 03:46:19.12
And that is

2870
03:46:19.12 --> 03:46:20.72
Oh, thank you. Yeah, well

2871
03:46:21.60 --> 03:46:25.20

You know and you mentioned that

2876
03:46:36.24 --> 03:46:42.64
What the Legion does around the world is like it's real stuff and it is protecting freedom and it is protecting innocent people and it is

2877
03:46:42.64 --> 03:46:44.000
Protecting

2878
03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:48.96
Democracy and so thanks for your service there. Thanks for your services a contract as well

2879
03:46:48.96 --> 03:46:54.48
Because that's an unsung position and look there's all kinds of crazy things that happen with contractors and

2880
03:46:54.88 --> 03:46:58.96
There's there's bad views of them a good views of them but I know this

2881
03:46:59.28 --> 03:47:00.56
It's a hard job

2882
03:47:00.56 --> 03:47:02.80
It's a job that people don't want to do

2883
03:47:02.80 --> 03:47:06.000
It's a huge risk when you do it and what you're doing is trying to help

2884
03:47:06.48 --> 03:47:12.08
Forward the positive things in the world America's goals the freedoms goals around the world

2885
03:47:12.08 --> 03:47:19.04
So thanks for what you did there so thanks for supporting America and our allies both as a contractor and

2886
03:47:19.76 --> 03:47:21.44
Of course, I guess I'll close with

2887
03:47:22.56 --> 03:47:26.40

2888

Some of these gigs are already sold out

2904

I have seen that there are tickets available on the secondary market. Do you know what that is echo channels?

2905
03:48:32.32 --> 03:48:36.64
Like a scalping yes, yes, so there are tickets available on the secondary market

2906
03:48:37.52 --> 03:48:39.52
prices are getting jacked

2907
03:48:40.56 --> 03:48:44.08
On the secondary market so if you're in one of the cities

2908
03:48:44.64 --> 03:48:49.12
You want to come go check it out because otherwise you might get

2909
03:48:49.12 --> 03:48:54.48
Shifted onto the secondary market and you're going to pay a higher price point

2910
03:48:56.24 --> 03:48:58.24
So check it out now

2911
03:49:00.24 --> 03:49:04.24

And that's good. I'm supporter long live the Legion. What about us?

How do we make our lives longer and better let me ask you that echo Charles what he got?

2915
03:49:22.64 --> 03:49:26.08
Well, easy the quick short answer is health

2916
03:49:26.96 --> 03:49:28.24
health

2917
03:49:28.24 --> 03:49:29.52
What does that mean no health?

2918
03:49:30.08 --> 03:49:33.28
Stress that's a good on stretch man stress management

2919
03:49:34.72 --> 03:49:40.000
I mean I just asked me on Twitter. Can you get me an example that's not physical where stress will will help you?

2920
03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:45.84
Not physical like not physical like okay, I get it if I work out. I'm gonna get stronger if I run hard

2921
03:49:45.84 --> 03:49:49.92
I'm gonna get healthier whatever yeah, and he said can you give me an example where

2922
03:49:50.56 --> 03:49:52.56
Where it's not physical but stress helps you

2923
03:49:53.92 --> 03:49:59.28
Yeah, I would all kind of stress helps you in the same way you can overload it. I mean I'd use the very simple example of

2924
03:49:59.68 --> 03:50:02.08
Speaking in front of people which is stressful

2925
03:50:03.12 --> 03:50:07.44
For some people and if it's stressful for you and you do it it'll become less stressful over time

2926
03:50:07.44 --> 03:50:15.36
So stress is good yeah, you basically the the basic formula is stress and then recovery from stress with healthy recovery

2927
03:50:16.08 --> 03:50:21.76
Sleep physically yes, yes, and we're gonna sleep exactly right and we'll just call it recovery effect

2928
03:50:21.76 --> 03:50:23.60
Re-correct recovery from the stress

2929
03:50:24.40 --> 03:50:30.72
Equals strength yes, and that goes for a non-physical as well. Yeah 100% but and the same goes inversely

2930
03:50:30.72 --> 03:50:35.68
If you don't have any stress at all as like if you don't have any exercise, so sure you're more comfortable

2931
03:50:35.68 --> 03:50:37.68
You're more you know these things

2932
03:50:38.88 --> 03:50:45.04
Let's stress but when life so unless you leave and let's see looking at a bunker

2933
03:50:45.92 --> 03:50:51.92
When the stress of life you yourself with the recorder not no you see them say unless these things all that stuff

2934
03:50:51.92 --> 03:50:54.32
Yeah, all those things but you can't think of any right now

2935
03:50:57.92 --> 03:50:59.92
Dude

2936
03:50:59.92 --> 03:51:07.12
When they come into your life you're not gonna be able to deal with them. You can be weak. They're gonna crumble you potentially

2937
03:51:08.08 --> 03:51:12.88
Same goes for if you don't effectively recover from stress. That's why people like non-physical stress people always

2938
03:51:13.04 --> 03:51:19.20
Recart it is like oh my gosh my life is stress because most times when you have too much stress with or chronic stress

2939
03:51:19.20 --> 03:51:24.32
The same thing is like chronic exercise, but I can't exercise all day every day. I got a rest from that stuff

2940
03:51:24.32 --> 03:51:28.40
You gotta recover from rest between sets all that stuff so the same kind of deal

2941
03:51:28.40 --> 03:51:36.32
Except for when people say oh, it's just stressful. It's like they they they look at it as a as a different kind of stress

2942
03:51:36.32 --> 03:51:40.64
Even though at the end of the day, it's essentially same thing. We need stress

2943
03:51:41.36 --> 03:51:48.40
You know in order to get better. You stress one good form of stress that you can participate in and it's very rewarding

2944
03:51:48.96 --> 03:51:55.20
It's you too. See and you just in a way is kind of the opposite of what we'd regard like stress like

2945
03:51:55.20 --> 03:52:02.84
People gonna do it to release stress, but technically that's not what stress is like stress is just basically a sort of like a

2946
03:52:03.48 --> 03:52:05.48
Resisting right yeah

2947
03:52:05.48 --> 03:52:12.12
Yeah, and there's certainly resistance in due to you. Yes, and it is resistance that will make you stronger better smarter faster

2948
03:52:12.68 --> 03:52:17.76
Just better better in every single in every single capacity. Oh, yeah, man

2949
03:52:17.76 --> 03:52:21.80
So you and you you'll do this every once in all you'll just have this emotional outbursts

2950
03:52:21.80 --> 03:52:25.52
This is you in this way all the mats of just no

2951
03:52:26.72 --> 03:52:32.64
Here's the thing me saying emotional outbursts is like it's kind of misleading like you know when you think of your emotional

2952
03:52:32.64 --> 03:52:35.000
I'll press it's like a bad thing almost

2953
03:52:35.20 --> 03:52:40.20
But you'll just break out out of nowhere and be like I lose love. Do you get to that's any emotional

2954
03:52:40.92 --> 03:52:46.76
So like yeah, like in New York you said that but probably feel that I think that in my head so much even though like

2955
03:52:46.76 --> 03:52:51.92
Even not even necessarily when I'm doing it a lot of times when I'm done doing it

2956
03:52:53.24 --> 03:52:55.24
So crazy how this exists

2957
03:52:56.24 --> 03:52:59.84
It is out there crazy is the funniest thing yeah

2958
03:53:00.12 --> 03:53:04.24
It's weird like certain times you can go to jiu-jitsu and be in such a good mood

2959
03:53:04.24 --> 03:53:10.20
You can see yourself behaving in almost like a weird child this way because you're so happy like a little excited child

2960
03:53:10.20 --> 03:53:13.40
Yes, yeah, that is that is a really happens statement

2961
03:53:13.40 --> 03:53:19.68
Yeah, anyway, so if you're not doing jiu-jitsu just do some jiu-jitsu just try man bring a friend bring a friend

2962
03:53:19.68 --> 03:53:24.60
That's actually a good way to maximize bring your friend sure your husband or life or whatever true. It's a good way

2963
03:53:24.60 --> 03:53:29.16
Anyway when you do it you're gonna need a key best-y in the world. Actually is an origin geek

2964
03:53:29.96 --> 03:53:31.96
You get these at originmain.com

2965
03:53:31.96 --> 03:53:34.96
So why is it the best in the world? Well one because it's made America

2966
03:53:35.52 --> 03:53:38.000
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you put that number one

2967
03:53:38.12 --> 03:53:39.96
because there's some people that say number one

2968
03:53:39.96 --> 03:53:41.96
It's the best functionality

2969
03:53:41.96 --> 03:53:43.96
Just strength

2970
03:53:44.36 --> 03:53:48.48
Performance it's the best for some people that's number one and that's a strong case

2971
03:53:48.48 --> 03:53:51.68
You can build a strong case without all day long. I actually support that case

2972
03:53:51.68 --> 03:53:56.44
If you wanted to pick one reason and say hey, here's why you should get an origin geek look

2973
03:53:56.44 --> 03:54:00.92
I don't care about anything else. I care about jiu-jitsu. I want the best possible you can get okay

2974
03:54:00.92 --> 03:54:04.20
I'm getting an origin geek. Yeah, there happens to be a bonus on top of that

2975
03:54:06.08 --> 03:54:09.76
That is made America. Yeah, that's kind of like the roots to the whole scenario

2976
03:54:09.76 --> 03:54:12.88
You seem saying because all the things about my selfish like

2977
03:54:14.32 --> 03:54:20.36
Benefits of having this game wearing this gear whatever sure there's some front-end stuff front-end benefits are huge

2978
03:54:20.80 --> 03:54:25.96
Huge but when you talk about made in America American economy and American industry all this stuff

2979
03:54:25.96 --> 03:54:27.96
This is all going on, you know

2980
03:54:27.96 --> 03:54:31.68
As roots of this scenario. It's the same. So yeah, man. I dig it

2981
03:54:32.08 --> 03:54:34.08
What ever way you want to look at it?

2982
03:54:34.08 --> 03:54:39.96
All all leaving all go one further as far as the selfish benefits of these origin geese

2983
03:54:39.96 --> 03:54:47.84
So I'm cleaning out my closet literally yesterday. Did you forget? I don't know. I don't know really recently and I have an old geese in there

2984
03:54:49.20 --> 03:54:53.04
Where I put off like man look at that you know like oh, I remember this. Yeah, I put it on

2985
03:54:53.04 --> 03:54:55.04
I was oh

2986
03:54:55.04 --> 03:54:59.04
I would never wear this thing though. It was borderline tortures

2987
03:54:59.04 --> 03:55:04.64
So where it is bad. All right, so get an origin geey for the performance and by the way

2988
03:55:04.64 --> 03:55:10.28
Yes when you get one you are supporting this podcast most important when you get a geey from a support

2989
03:55:10.44 --> 03:55:14.56
Perspective you're supporting yourself and you're supporting the United States of America and it's economy

2990
03:55:14.96 --> 03:55:16.96
We're rebuilding a community

2991
03:55:17.52 --> 03:55:24.04
Plus you can if you don't necessarily want to wear a geey to the supermarket to the club

2992
03:55:24.04 --> 03:55:30.20
It's for as clubs go. Yeah, you don't want to wear a geey there. You can wear origin t-shirts

2993
03:55:30.20 --> 03:55:34.60
You can wear origin sweatshirts. You can wear origin jeans by the way

2994
03:55:35.40 --> 03:55:37.40
Pete's mad at me

2995
03:55:37.40 --> 03:55:44.44
Okay, because I announced Delta 68 lightweight jeans with a little bit of stretch in them now

2996
03:55:44.44 --> 03:55:47.48
The all origin jeans have a little bit of stretch in them, but the are

2997
03:55:47.96 --> 03:55:51.000
Super comfortable little lightweight because I'm not a person that gets cold legs

2998
03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:55.08
I know it's weird and I know it's a dichotomy that I want heavyweight

2999
03:55:56.36 --> 03:56:01.16
Sure heavyweight sweatshirt heavyweight hoodie lightweight jeans, but that's how I am

3000
03:56:02.20 --> 03:56:06.28
Here I am so check out the jeans and also we got supplements up there

3001
03:56:07.32 --> 03:56:14.84
Which are important big time especially for longevity long list right true supplements big time to keep you in the game so

3002
03:56:15.32 --> 03:56:17.32
and

3003
03:56:17.32 --> 03:56:22.60
I'm not gonna tell you all well damn even though we already know but I'm older than I was before

3004
03:56:28.60 --> 03:56:35.56
And I can I don't want to say I surprised myself. I'm not saying that but I'm very happy with where I am physically

3005
03:56:35.96 --> 03:56:38.04
Capability wise like able to

3006
03:56:38.76 --> 03:56:42.84
You mean what will let's say we're not mad how about that? We're not mad at your content

3007
03:56:42.84 --> 03:56:49.56
Where capability wise, you know, I can do essentially the same things as far as I can remember that I was doing

3008
03:56:50.84 --> 03:56:52.20
Back in the day

3009
03:56:52.52 --> 03:56:54.52
When back in it

3010
03:56:55.64 --> 03:56:57.88
You see what I'm saying yeah, so and of course

3011
03:56:58.44 --> 03:57:05.16
Because of joint warfare, krill oil, super and actually what I take almost not every day, but like really often even though I don't

3012
03:57:05.72 --> 03:57:11.000
I'm called needed is cold or yeah, they mean it's nice to have that little kicker

3013
03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:13.000
Yeah, that little cold war

3014
03:57:14.04 --> 03:57:22.12
Kicker well this ingredients are beneficial just generally general benefits. Yeah, yeah good good

3015
03:57:22.12 --> 03:57:29.56
So also discipline and discipline go in the can by the way, which you can just crack open and almost any moment

3016
03:57:30.20 --> 03:57:34.36
But pretty much anyone pretty much anyone and then there's a discipline go the powder

3017
03:57:35.56 --> 03:57:37.56
Which is a good little prejudging

3018
03:57:37.56 --> 03:57:45.08
scenario oh wait, it's not discipline go just discipline and and my personal favorite flavor of any drink

3019
03:57:45.64 --> 03:57:47.64
By the way, is jockel bomber

3020
03:57:49.08 --> 03:57:51.48
Just tasty and then of course you got extra

3021
03:57:52.44 --> 03:57:54.44
Let's call it protein

3022
03:57:54.92 --> 03:57:59.48
Let me ask you this if you're gonna have protein. Would you want it to taste like cardboard?

3023
03:58:00.60 --> 03:58:01.80
A

3024
03:58:01.80 --> 03:58:08.44
B salt water or sea a dessert which one would you want?

3025
03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:11.64
Yeah, okay real suffix my idea now

3026
03:58:11.64 --> 03:58:16.52
Get yourself some milk and get some warrior kid milk for your children don't give them poison

3027
03:58:17.72 --> 03:58:19.72
actual poison don't

3028
03:58:19.72 --> 03:58:21.72
Give them something tasty

3029
03:58:22.36 --> 03:58:27.88
Agreed anyway origin main.com this where you can get all teeth. Did you mention why too? No, no, yeah

3030
03:58:28.28 --> 03:58:29.80
It is winter time

3031
03:58:29.80 --> 03:58:33.48
So I need that little warm hitter. Get yourself some jockel weight tea

3032
03:58:34.36 --> 03:58:38.52
All right, yeah, sorry with just today was like well this jockel weight tea is good

3033
03:58:38.92 --> 03:58:41.48
It's like and I didn't really know what she meant because you know

3034
03:58:42.12 --> 03:58:44.28
She's been in the business my lovely wife

3035
03:58:45.88 --> 03:58:47.88
Because we've been drinking

3036
03:58:47.96 --> 03:58:49.96
This stuff for a long time

3037
03:58:49.96 --> 03:58:52.76
So it's almost like she had an emotional out

3038
03:58:52.76 --> 03:59:00.84
Kind of like the jockel weight tea so good actually just so happens that I got the new shipment in

3039
03:59:00.84 --> 03:59:06.04
So she might have been out of the game for a little bit you seem saying and then she gets you revisited it and then was like

3040
03:59:06.60 --> 03:59:11.64
Had that I got to say it is refreshing the cans refreshing

3041
03:59:13.08 --> 03:59:18.04
More refreshing remember when you were a kid and you drink gatorade? Yes, and it kind of left that syrup

3042
03:59:18.04 --> 03:59:20.04
He tasted your mouth and it's not refreshing

3043
03:59:20.28 --> 03:59:21.64
Sure

3044
03:59:21.64 --> 03:59:23.64
Was it refreshing

3045
03:59:24.04 --> 03:59:27.80
It depends on the circumstances, but yeah, well, you're not going to need any circumstantial

3046
03:59:28.68 --> 03:59:37.32
Issues going on track open the jockel weight tea 100% refreshed 100% refreshed yeah under all circumstances all circumstances covered

3047
03:59:37.32 --> 03:59:41.16
I dig it also jockel is a store and it's called jockel store

3048
03:59:42.36 --> 03:59:49.56
We're sticking with jockel store. I think great creative name jockel store.com. This is where you can get more ash guards

Also

3065
04:00:53.16 --> 04:01:01.48
The only podcast in this whole scenario okay grounded podcast if you're interested in something a little bit more loose free flowing

3066
04:01:02.76 --> 04:01:04.76
I was gonna say magical but that doesn't make sense

3067
04:01:05.80 --> 04:01:11.48
But you know little little less structured less heavy for sure definitely less heavy. Yeah, we have not

3068
04:01:11.48 --> 04:01:14.52
You have not cried on the grounded podcast yet

3069
04:01:17.96 --> 04:01:20.60

All right, so thank you just for that

3071
04:01:26.84 --> 04:01:30.68
Technically it is true so I'm cried on the worry keep that case either

3072
04:01:31.40 --> 04:01:35.000
In on the word no you haven't been on it, but you've been listening and I've seen you get close

04:02:14.04 --> 04:02:17.64
You get to work and you make something that will help everyone in the world

3082
04:02:19.56 --> 04:02:21.56
Stay clean

3083
04:02:23.24 --> 04:02:29.40
Very true also you we have YouTube channel you're interested in the video version of what we're doing here

3084
04:02:30.20 --> 04:02:32.20
You're gonna see what Joel looks like

3085
04:02:32.20 --> 04:02:36.60
You see what Joel looks like if you see what echo looks like in apparently echo

3086
04:02:37.88 --> 04:02:41.48
Doesn't look like what he sounds like in the on a unlikely event

3087
04:02:41.48 --> 04:02:45.40
You want to see what it looks like yes. We have YouTube channel also some excerpts on there if

3088
04:02:46.12 --> 04:02:49.80
Maybe you're not at the mood to watch the whole 12 hour podcast

3089
04:02:51.32 --> 04:02:57.32
Sometimes yeah, you know, so we have really short excerpts that echo bags that are only like 27 minutes

3090
04:02:57.32 --> 04:02:59.56
Yeah, sure just you know sure in a couple a little bit

3091
04:02:59.56 --> 04:03:07.000
Cool in my opinion, please let us know via social media if you think an excerpt should be four minutes or

3092
04:03:07.88 --> 04:03:13.48
14 I'll say what I think and we all know what echo things and well I have my my

3093
04:03:14.20 --> 04:03:19.08
Opinion has been refined recently. What is it now focused on there is no time

3094
04:03:19.56 --> 04:03:21.000
Constraint or

3095
04:03:21.000 --> 04:03:29.48
Recommended guideline it's however long it takes to get an effective message across what I would like to see just a suggestion from my

3096
04:03:29.80 --> 04:03:32.60
Don't want to interfere with your business over there with what you do

3097
04:03:33.08 --> 04:03:37.80
Really taking so much time and effort to cut out a 19 minute section and just put it up there

3098
04:03:37.88 --> 04:03:42.04
What if you just edited it down so it was like here's the point here's the question here's the point

3099
04:03:42.12 --> 04:03:44.12
What if it was three minutes on well?

3100
04:03:45.16 --> 04:03:47.16
Wouldn't that be more like an excerpt?

3101
04:03:47.16 --> 04:03:53.72
I think it's all excerpt well technically what does that sort of mean just means like a part of something so it can be a 19 minute part fine

3102
04:03:53.72 --> 04:03:59.52
If the clue if a point takes 19 minutes to talk about I don't think the point takes 19 minutes in most cases

3103
04:04:00.12 --> 04:04:03.16
So I'm just saying reassess is all I'm saying

3104
04:04:03.16 --> 04:04:05.96
Let's not let's not let our ego get in the way

3105
04:04:05.96 --> 04:04:07.96
Make a good decision. What is the answer?

3106
04:04:07.96 --> 04:04:11.24
Did you resty all I know so we're gonna keep moving forward and

3107
04:04:11.24 --> 04:04:17.16
Don't try to put the best of your video to subscribe to YouTube channel so you can watch 19 minutes excerpts. Thank you

3108
04:04:17.16 --> 04:04:19.16
But there's more stuff on there

3109
04:04:19.88 --> 04:04:25.000
Anyway, yeah, if you want we do if you want something shorter to listen to go to psychological warfare

3110
04:04:25.88 --> 04:04:28.84
It's an MP3 album. It has tracks

3111
04:04:29.24 --> 04:04:38.28
Where whatever moment of weakness you are experiencing I will personally come through your headphones and help you overcome that moment of weakness by

3112
04:04:38.28 --> 04:04:43.80
Speaking words into your ears and telling you to stay on the path

3113
04:04:45.40 --> 04:04:46.76
And don't forget if you need a

3114
04:04:47.64 --> 04:04:53.000
Visual representation of the path and a reminder to stay on it check out flip side-cam this dot com

3115
04:04:53.32 --> 04:04:57.24
Which is run by my brother the code of mine where he makes things

3116
04:04:58.28 --> 04:05:04.20
That are sometimes referred to as graphic art and you can hang them on your walls and they say things like good

3117
04:05:04.20 --> 04:05:10.36
Or get after it or discipline equals freedom or you can tell the code of what you want

3118
04:05:11.40 --> 04:05:19.24
As far as books go first of all the book that we covered today a pel Canadian in the French foreign Legion by Joel Strothers awesome book very cool

3119
04:05:19.24 --> 04:05:21.24
I left out so many

3120
04:05:21.48 --> 04:05:28.92
Good stories obviously, but it's a great book so you can pick that up click through the Amazon link also we got leadership strategy and tactic field manual

3125
04:05:50.36 --> 04:05:52.36
Because of you

3126
04:05:53.72 --> 04:05:55.72
Actually because of me

3127
04:05:55.72 --> 04:05:59.40
I did a bad job of explaining to you how important it was it's my fault

3128
04:05:59.40 --> 04:06:05.64
It's my fault so right now what I'm trying to do is explain to you that if you don't order it you won't get it and then

3129
04:06:06.04 --> 04:06:08.52
If you do order it life will be good

3130
04:06:09.32 --> 04:06:15.80
Leader substratages and tactics field manual we got the way the warrior kid books three two and one all out

3133
04:06:23.48 --> 04:06:30.20
Foundational thing that they need to know as a kid how to overcome fear they can learn it right there

3134
04:06:30.20 --> 04:06:34.68
Mikey and the dragons incredible feedback on that book all the time it is not rare

3135
04:06:36.12 --> 04:06:38.76
That a grown human male or female

3136
04:06:40.44 --> 04:06:44.84
Crys while reading that book you you had an emotional first

3137
04:06:44.84 --> 04:06:49.76
Wasn't it it wasn't an outburst but wait your brother Jj was something was it your brother J Charles

3138
04:06:49.76 --> 04:06:56.64
Well same same kind of deal where's the operation there is an emotional what do you call it when the needle by loser

3139
04:06:56.64 --> 04:06:59.92
But you know so I can one of those situations. Yeah. Well

3140
04:07:00.64 --> 04:07:04.32
I think that when you have kids well when I say I think I believe

3141
04:07:05.36 --> 04:07:06.64
So far

3142
04:07:06.64 --> 04:07:09.92
That when you have kids like certain things will affect you differently, you know

3143
04:07:09.92 --> 04:07:14.24
So anytime it makes you think of your kids in the certain context or whatever like yeah

3144
04:07:14.24 --> 04:07:16.64
That's what it sort of induces so that's what it did

3145
04:07:17.44 --> 04:07:19.44
Simply put

3146
04:07:19.44 --> 04:07:21.44

In between me and echo

3176

Right now listening maybe you want to chime in and tell echo like to make those excerpts a little bit shorter

3177
04:09:17.60 --> 04:09:19.60
You probably aren't thinking that

3178
04:09:20.16 --> 04:09:22.16
But you can't really interact with us

3179
04:09:23.92 --> 04:09:28.88
Except for on the inner website. Yes, but with the EF online you're actually putting leadership positions

3180
04:09:29.28 --> 04:09:33.84
You're you got to make decisions you got to figure out what the best call is if you make a bad call

3181
04:09:33.84 --> 04:09:38.16
You're gonna hear about it things are gonna go sideways if you make a good call you're gonna progress

To keep us safe and keep us protected and to everyone else out there

3218
04:12:21.80 --> 04:12:24.84
Let's remember the power of the Legionnaires code and

3219
04:12:25.88 --> 04:12:33.32
The parts of that code that applied all of us that discipline is our strength that courage and loyalty are our

3220
04:12:33.56 --> 04:12:36.84
Virtues that we have to display

3221
04:12:36.84 --> 04:12:41.40
dignified but modest behavior got a balance that dichotomy

3222
04:12:41.40 --> 04:12:46.28
That we have to take constant care of our physical form

3223
04:12:48.12 --> 04:12:49.96
That means we have to train rigorously

3224
04:12:51.56 --> 04:12:55.16
We have to remember that our mission is sacred

3225
04:12:58.12 --> 04:13:03.64
Your mission is sacred you carry it out until the end and you know you have a mission

3226
04:13:05.48 --> 04:13:07.48
You know you do

3227
04:13:07.48 --> 04:13:12.12

3228
04:13:13.80 --> 04:13:15.80

This is echo and jockel out
