00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.44 This is Jocoponcast number 272 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening.
00:00:07.44 --> 00:00:20.48 So when I worked with seal leaders and then on top of that, interacted with leaders from the army and from the Marine Corps,
00:00:20.48 --> 00:00:31.68 sometimes things went great and sometimes they didn't. And if there was a problem between
00:00:31.68 --> 00:00:40.48 leaders, between leaders, between people, between troops 99% of the time, when I would pull
00:00:40.48 --> 00:00:50.32 the thread on that problem, at the end of that thread would be ego. Did you find it all the time? I'd
00:00:50.32 --> 00:00:55.28 find it all the time. And when I retired from the Navy and I started working with leadership in civilian
00:00:55.28 --> 00:01:07.20 companies, no shock. I found the same thing. When leaders can't get along, when they can't find
00:01:07.20 --> 00:01:14.88 a solution, when they can't even move forward despite having a common goal. When I'm working with
00:01:14.88 --> 00:01:24.72 companies and I pull the thread on that problem, I find the same thing. I find ego. And ego test
00:01:24.72 --> 00:01:35.20 to go leaders scream and they yell and they get emotional and they would rather lose. They would
00:01:35.20 --> 00:01:41.12 rather lose than admit that they're wrong. They would actually rather die in some cases than
00:01:41.12 --> 00:01:50.24 admit that they're wrong. And if you think that that's an exaggeration, history is full of leaders,
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.08 military leaders that died clinging to their plan, even in the face of their own death,
00:02:00.08 --> 00:02:12.40 or worse, the deaths of their troops. All because there you go. Now look, of course,
00:02:12.40 --> 00:02:19.60 it's a dichotomy. We know that not all ego is bad. You need ego to push you and drive you and
00:02:19.60 --> 00:02:26.72 make you on a win and that's great. But over inflated ego is the root of a vast majority of problems
00:02:26.72 --> 00:02:39.28 that people and leaders face. And as I look at the divisiveness in America right now,
00:02:42.32 --> 00:02:51.52 the people that are screaming from the extreme ends of the political spectrum, when I listen to
00:02:51.52 --> 00:02:57.52 what they're saying and why they're saying it, I try and figure out where this is coming from.
00:02:57.52 --> 00:03:01.04 When I pull the thread on all that screaming and all that anger,
00:03:02.96 --> 00:03:15.92 yes, once again, I find ego. Because if you think you're right about everything,
00:03:15.92 --> 00:03:20.56 if you think that you're right about everything, then that means everybody else is wrong.
00:03:23.68 --> 00:03:28.48 And if you think that you know everything, then that means no one else can know anything.
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.92 And if your ego is so big and you think you're so smart, why would you even have to listen to
00:03:37.92 --> 00:03:47.84 anybody else? Because you already have it figured out. Why not just scream at them to shut up?
00:03:47.84 --> 00:03:52.48 And you gotta watch out, especially when if if if someone is saying something that actually
00:03:52.48 --> 00:03:56.64 makes some kind of sense in it, hurt your ego, then just scream louder.
00:04:01.28 --> 00:04:07.20 And when I look around and I see people that are screaming and not listening, that's what I see.
00:04:07.20 --> 00:04:18.24 I see ego. And sometimes it's driven by insecurity, insecurity that they think there might be wrong.
00:04:18.24 --> 00:04:22.48 And so then again, what do they do? They just scream louder. Don't let anyone else talk.
00:04:27.20 --> 00:04:31.12 Shut them up. That's what the ego does.
00:04:31.12 --> 00:04:42.64 That being said, there are people out there today, many of whom are humble.
00:04:42.64 --> 00:04:48.08 People that do listen. People that can have an interactive conversational exchange with
00:04:48.08 --> 00:04:54.40 someone else that might have opposing viewpoints. And they're confident enough in themselves to
00:04:54.40 --> 00:05:00.80 actually listen and discuss and compromise and change their minds and learn and grow and understand
00:05:01.92 --> 00:05:12.64 and empathize. And those types of people, well they make good neighbors.
00:05:12.64 --> 00:05:23.28 They make good soldiers. They make good friends. They make good human beings and they make good leaders.
00:05:24.32 --> 00:05:29.60 And I'm lucky enough to have one of those people here with us tonight. A soldier,
00:05:31.60 --> 00:05:39.76 a martial artist, a surfer, a former congresswoman, a Hawaiian,
00:05:39.76 --> 00:05:47.68 and an American. You might have figured it out. Tulsi Gabbard.
00:05:49.68 --> 00:05:54.80 Tulsi, thanks for joining us. Aloha. The last time we were together was on
00:05:54.80 --> 00:06:04.72 Joe Rogan's podcast. Yes, that was fun. When was that? I think that was some time in 2019.
00:06:04.72 --> 00:06:17.60 Were you running yet? Yeah, I was. Yeah. And it's been a wild ride. I think it's been cool for me
00:06:17.60 --> 00:06:22.64 to watch. I know it's not always been cool for you. I'm thinking like, I don't know if cool is
00:06:22.64 --> 00:06:26.80 the word I would use. It's always cool for me to look at some of that's like trying to make
00:06:26.80 --> 00:06:30.72 something happen and coming up against all kinds of obstacles and still striving forward and
00:06:30.72 --> 00:06:37.92 pushing forward. So from that perspective, it's cool. So let's kind of like, um,
00:06:37.92 --> 00:06:41.84 I always like to start from the beginning. It's kind of what I like to do. So I have a better context
00:06:41.84 --> 00:06:47.68 and understanding of where someone ends up because we know more about where they came from. Yeah.
00:06:47.68 --> 00:06:54.40 So let's talk about where you came from. How did you end up here today? It started off where
00:06:54.40 --> 00:07:00.72 American Samoa. American Samoa is where I was born. I am the boy. Did you just suddenly
00:07:00.72 --> 00:07:06.16 correct my pronunciation? My pronunciation. Samoa? Yeah. What's correct? It's, you got to,
00:07:06.16 --> 00:07:11.68 you got to elongate the A a little bit. Samoa. It's Samoa. Yeah. It's, I don't,
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:19.04 it's just a fact. Right. I feel very comfortable speaking. I mean, obviously, I speak all the time.
00:07:19.04 --> 00:07:26.24 But words that I don't know how to say, I just do my best and move on. No. I mean,
00:07:26.24 --> 00:07:32.000 we'll cover books where I've got French words and German names and what I just run into total
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.16 things that I just don't know how to say them. And so what I do is I just do my best and move on.
00:07:36.16 --> 00:07:40.64 And I think I get a certain level of forgiveness from people. Hopefully. I do get tightened up
00:07:40.64 --> 00:07:46.24 from time to time if I really make something awful. But yeah, I guess you have to,
00:07:46.24 --> 00:07:51.60 forgive me a little bit because I just kind of say what it looks like to me. But that
00:07:51.60 --> 00:07:57.44 agree and move on. No judgment whatsoever. I however would get in trouble if I
00:07:57.44 --> 00:08:03.04 did not. Yeah. We're not seeing my homeland properly. If you say Samoa, though, like Samoa
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:09.60 or Samoa, and that's more like forgivable. That's like the proper way that's like
00:08:09.60 --> 00:08:14.48 you use the proper way. But if you don't, it's kind of like, okay, it's, it's way more forgivable
00:08:14.48 --> 00:08:19.84 with someone. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it's not a major violation. It's not a violation.
00:08:19.84 --> 00:08:25.28 Yeah. No. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's only people from Samoa who say Samoa.
00:08:25.28 --> 00:08:29.76 Yes. It's pretty much. It's an insulting that I would say Samoa. Yeah. That's a good little bit.
00:08:29.76 --> 00:08:34.72 No. Okay. So we're good either way. All right. Well, and I went to Guam. There was people from
00:08:34.72 --> 00:08:42.40 Samoa there and we hung out. Most good people. All right. So you and Leather. So my mom
00:08:42.40 --> 00:08:51.92 was born in Indiana, grew up in Michigan. Dad born in Born and Samoa. My grandfather was in
00:08:51.92 --> 00:08:57.52 the Air Force. And so he was born there, but he spent the first years of his life in Hawaii.
00:08:57.52 --> 00:09:03.20 My grandfather was stationed at Hickum. And then I moved around a few other places, but ended up
00:09:03.20 --> 00:09:08.32 growing up in the Panhandle of Florida. So wait. So your grandfather was in the Air Force?
00:09:08.32 --> 00:09:15.20 Yeah. Both of my grandfather's on my mom's side. At my dad's side served served in the military.
00:09:15.20 --> 00:09:21.52 That must have been around the world, Walter. It was. Yeah. So my mom's dad served in
00:09:22.48 --> 00:09:28.40 believe he served in Europe. I don't know exactly where. And then, but for a shorter stint that
00:09:28.40 --> 00:09:32.96 he didn't spend a career in the military, but my dad's dad did spend his career in the military.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.52 At different times served. I think he was in the army for a little while. Then he was in the army
00:09:37.52 --> 00:09:44.96 air corps and then ended up in the Air Force. And so they both had completely different upbringings.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.20 You know, my mom grew up in East Grand Rapids, Michigan, which was during that time.
00:09:51.20 --> 00:09:59.60 He had very kind of well-to-do area in her school. There were no non-white people.
00:10:00.96 --> 00:10:05.36 And so, you know, she grew up. She's a cheerleader. She was this. She kind of had the all-American
00:10:05.36 --> 00:10:09.04 upbringings. So she's a white person too. She is a white person.
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:17.60 Howlias we say in Hawaii. It's a little digression here. People say howlias a drugatory.
00:10:17.60 --> 00:10:22.08 We're of all depends on how you use it. It can go either way. That's right.
00:10:22.08 --> 00:10:26.80 And it can be referred to as an attitude. I don't care what your skin color is.
00:10:27.52 --> 00:10:33.52 It can be used to the drugatory. Or it can just be like, okay, you happen to be Caucasian and howli.
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:42.08 But yeah. So, yes, my mom is howli based on her skin color. And yeah, my dad, Polynesian, grew up.
00:10:43.44 --> 00:10:51.44 grew up essentially in the south. And it was so stark there upbringings. And to hear both of them tell
00:10:51.44 --> 00:11:00.32 stories about it because, you know, my dad's going to elementary school. And he told me how
00:11:00.32 --> 00:11:04.80 to teach her ass as an all the kids. Okay, where are you from? And he raised his hand. He's like,
00:11:04.80 --> 00:11:11.04 I'm from Samoa. And she said, what? So Malia? He's from Africa. He's like, no, no, no, Samoa.
00:11:11.04 --> 00:11:15.68 It's, you know, and that was it. All the kids started making fun of him. He's the only kid
00:11:15.68 --> 00:11:23.84 with brown skin skin in the class. And, you know, would go out and town and get called, get called
00:11:23.84 --> 00:11:28.80 the N word, get scolded out of, you know, the men's bathroom told you got to go use the
00:11:28.80 --> 00:11:33.84 colored bathroom. You know, there's no water fountain. You got to go use the hose in the back
00:11:33.84 --> 00:11:41.12 because the water fountain is for whites only. And so as he was so confused coming from Samoa
00:11:41.12 --> 00:11:48.08 and then Hawaii. And he's like, I mean, I'm not, I'm not black. I'm like he was, it was, it was at a
00:11:48.08 --> 00:11:56.08 young age. Just kind of being confronted with racism, obviously, but also just confusion on his part.
00:11:56.08 --> 00:12:06.40 And that, that kind of was the, made a huge impact in his, in his formative years in life.
00:12:07.36 --> 00:12:13.68 And so fast forward, he's going to college in California, Mom's going to University of
00:12:13.68 --> 00:12:18.40 Michigan. They both had summer jobs at Yosemite and which is how they met.
00:12:19.68 --> 00:12:24.80 And, uh, Facebook. That was, you know what, you're that was? That would have been in the 60s.
00:12:24.80 --> 00:12:32.96 Mm-hmm. And maybe they'd no tilt. One of our frequent podcasts, guests, John Stryker
00:12:32.96 --> 00:12:39.20 Meyer, who ended up being a Green Brake, Saga and Vietnam. Before he went to army, he went out to
00:12:39.20 --> 00:12:45.12 Yosemite and work there in the summer. Is he the guy who has come with some of the Vietnamese?
00:12:45.12 --> 00:12:49.36 Yes. Yeah. Okay. That's cool. That's cool. Those are amazing. Oh my god. I love those,
00:12:49.36 --> 00:12:54.56 hear it from those guys out of this world. So they're working, so they meet, they're working
00:12:54.56 --> 00:13:02.80 out of cafe in Yosemite. Dad's checking Mom out. And, um, asked her out and she's like,
00:13:03.36 --> 00:13:07.84 okay, like, let's go, she's like, do you play tennis? He's like, yeah,
00:13:09.12 --> 00:13:14.56 he didn't play tennis at all. She's like, okay, cool. Let's go play as their first date. So they
00:13:14.56 --> 00:13:20.16 went out in the tennis court. She beat him six love, six love for the non-tenuous players. That
00:13:20.16 --> 00:13:24.08 means zero. He got zero points. But I think the keyword was actually love.
00:13:25.44 --> 00:13:33.20 Exactly. I could see where this is going. Love and what became a very healthy competition.
00:13:33.76 --> 00:13:41.60 He then later on, went and became a actual tennis pro. And they've been married now almost,
00:13:41.60 --> 00:13:47.52 I think 53 years and still played tennis almost every day together. It's awesome.
00:13:49.60 --> 00:13:57.20 But that was how that was how Mike and Carol gathered began. And the first, I think one of the,
00:13:57.20 --> 00:14:02.64 yeah, the first time he went to visit my mom and Michigan after they were, they were going
00:14:02.64 --> 00:14:10.08 out for a little while. And my mom, I think actually, I think they were going out for a little while.
00:14:10.08 --> 00:14:14.16 My mom had decided, like, she wanted to marry this guy and told my grandma.
00:14:15.04 --> 00:14:19.84 And my dad happened to be in the garage about to walk in the door and start over here this conversation
00:14:19.84 --> 00:14:26.08 inside the house. And I heard my grandmother's response to my mom saying, Carol,
00:14:27.28 --> 00:14:35.12 but he's not even white. How can you marry him? And Dad was a little taken a back
00:14:35.12 --> 00:14:42.24 and turned around and went back and got in the car and went and took a little bit of time.
00:14:44.48 --> 00:14:50.24 But it was just a reflection of the complete start differences and where they were from and,
00:14:50.24 --> 00:14:56.32 you know, their views of the world and, and obviously they fell in love with my dad and, and,
00:14:56.32 --> 00:15:04.80 it was, yeah, bringing together of two different people, two different backgrounds and,
00:15:04.80 --> 00:15:10.40 and ultimately, you know, my dad took her away from the mainland and, and to, to Somal,
00:15:10.40 --> 00:15:14.64 where they both went and, as teachers, they both got jobs as teachers there. My mom was doing
00:15:15.52 --> 00:15:19.68 shoes of speech therapists, so helping kids who had different kind of speech issues.
00:15:20.56 --> 00:15:24.96 And Dad became, I think, the assistant dean of the community college there, who's an English major.
00:15:24.96 --> 00:15:30.40 And so they, the three, there's five kids in our family and the three middle kids
00:15:31.20 --> 00:15:37.52 were all born there and then we moved to Hawaii when I was two years old, so Hawaii's been home
00:15:37.52 --> 00:15:45.92 for me ever since. Did you get to Hawaii and, I mean, what's it like when you get there,
00:15:45.92 --> 00:15:49.92 what, like, what are your memories of growing up in Hawaii? What were your formative memories?
00:15:49.92 --> 00:15:55.36 Some was one of my earliest memories, so I'm four or five, so my little sister was, is baby
00:15:55.36 --> 00:16:03.84 of the family and she was, she was born in Hawaii and, um, she, basically, she came a little sooner
00:16:03.84 --> 00:16:09.44 than expected and so my dad delivered her at home quickly and I watched that happen.
00:16:11.60 --> 00:16:18.16 That was, that was a big strong dose of reality, you know, I'm, I'm three years old at the time.
00:16:18.16 --> 00:16:22.08 Can you remember it? I have, I vaguely remember.
00:16:22.08 --> 00:16:28.24 For your PTSD. I pretty much, I don't remember, I, like, I can't visualize it, but I do remember
00:16:29.12 --> 00:16:34.16 being somewhat traumatized by it. Yeah. Well, I, and the, the, let's, the story goes that, like,
00:16:34.16 --> 00:16:40.56 my babysitter who was there also that, that after witnessing that, um, I told her like,
00:16:40.56 --> 00:16:50.88 I never, ever, what, what to do that? But, um, yeah, so, uh, we, we moved around, like, group on the island of
00:16:50.88 --> 00:16:56.88 Hawaii. What was your parents doing for work there? They were teachers, um, they were teachers there,
00:16:57.76 --> 00:17:04.88 they had started kind of a small, a small private school that we went to and then, um, and then
00:17:04.88 --> 00:17:11.36 they ended up, uh, the school had to close down for, for one reason or another, um, but then anyway,
00:17:11.36 --> 00:17:15.36 they, they ended up teaching us, we were home schooled and they ended up teaching us in a bunch of
00:17:15.36 --> 00:17:20.24 other kind of kids in the neighborhood at home. And then they, they're, they're entrepreneurs at
00:17:20.24 --> 00:17:24.24 heart. They've always been, even at back in Samoa, they were teaching, but they had, uh, Mike's 10,
00:17:24.24 --> 00:17:28.32 uh, Mike's sports shop. They had his little sports shop. And so they've always had some kind of side
00:17:28.32 --> 00:17:33.84 gig happening and always different ideas for new businesses and, and eventually they opened, um,
00:17:33.84 --> 00:17:40.80 kind of family style, Delhi, restaurant, healthy, healthy eating. Um, so they, they've done a lot of
00:17:40.80 --> 00:17:48.48 different things in their lives and, um, it's always been, uh, family, family affairs.
00:17:49.44 --> 00:17:53.52 Everything that's going on, you, did you have involvement where you make in Samoosh's down at the
00:17:53.52 --> 00:17:57.60 Delhi? I'm the one, I get to take credit for coming up with a name of the restaurant. It was called
00:17:57.60 --> 00:18:02.32 the Natural Delhi. And we, I remember us sitting around in the family living room and having a
00:18:02.32 --> 00:18:09.52 brainstorm session and we were all, we are all quite competitive. Uh, and the deal was whoever
00:18:09.52 --> 00:18:14.32 who ever comes up with the name of the restaurant gets one free dinner at the restaurant. Wow.
00:18:14.32 --> 00:18:18.32 Yeah. Apparently your competitive is an out of great progression. Exactly.
00:18:18.32 --> 00:18:25.52 I had no idea, I felt very victorious in my, my, my win. However, had no idea that we would pretty
00:18:25.52 --> 00:18:34.40 much be eating there every day. It's so, how long were you in this home school before it was
00:18:34.40 --> 00:18:42.48 cool scenario? I, um, all the way through high school. Really? Yeah. Yep. And, uh, it was so there,
00:18:42.48 --> 00:18:48.48 there's a five-year gap between me and my closest brother, the three boys are about two years apart.
00:18:48.48 --> 00:18:53.52 And then, there's, there's, there's a story that my dad loves to tell, which is that after the three
00:18:53.52 --> 00:18:59.84 boys, my mom was like, that's it. I'm done. Um, she got her tubes tied. She was seriously
00:18:59.84 --> 00:19:05.52 done. It was, she wasn't just saying it. Mm-hmm. And this is in Samoa, like way back when, where
00:19:05.52 --> 00:19:12.16 the hospital today is still probably about, you know, 20 years behind modern medicine. So,
00:19:13.36 --> 00:19:20.48 so it took my dad a few years, but he finally convinced her to have more kids. So she went to
00:19:20.48 --> 00:19:26.56 the hospital in Samoa. She's like, okay, you gotta undo what I did here and it worked. And, uh, so
00:19:26.56 --> 00:19:30.96 my sister and I came along and, and that's where there's a five-year gap between us and every birthday
00:19:30.96 --> 00:19:38.56 for me and my sister, he's like, girls. Better thank me. It wouldn't be her without me and your mom,
00:19:38.56 --> 00:19:42.000 your mom too, but what were you thinking of when you're, when you're going to high school, what
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.68 do you think you're, of doing with your life? Um, I didn't have, I didn't have a specific
00:19:49.68 --> 00:19:58.80 profession, uh, in mind or career path or anything. I did understand and realize from a really
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:08.48 young age, even before high school, that, um, I think, I think two big, two big things. Number one was
00:20:08.48 --> 00:20:14.56 that I was happiest when I was, um, when I was doing things for other people. So, you know,
00:20:14.56 --> 00:20:19.76 we'd go out and we'd do like beach cleanups and, you know, growing up in Hawaii's, I love the ocean.
00:20:19.76 --> 00:20:25.44 I literally like, I learned how to swim at all I want to beach, you know, in the, in the shore there
00:20:26.48 --> 00:20:32.48 and, um, just just loved our home and, and from a really young age, had a really, um,
00:20:33.04 --> 00:20:38.32 deep appreciation and a kind of a sense of being a protector for our home. And so, you know, we,
00:20:38.32 --> 00:20:44.64 we'd, we'd go out and, um, you know, do beach cleanups and do other things and I just, I just felt
00:20:45.28 --> 00:20:52.96 happiest when I was doing things for others when I, when I could be of service and, um,
00:20:53.52 --> 00:20:58.48 understood and realized from a young age that that's what I wanted to do and, and really in a
00:20:58.48 --> 00:21:05.76 deeper spiritual way, understanding that, um, I was happiest when being of service to God and,
00:21:05.76 --> 00:21:11.92 uh, what better way to be of service to God than to care for and to serve
00:21:12.56 --> 00:21:18.40 God's children and, and this, this planet. So, that was something that I knew in a decision I made
00:21:18.40 --> 00:21:22.72 very early on but what exactly that was looked like, how, you know, what path that would take. I had,
00:21:22.72 --> 00:21:28.48 I had no, no idea, but I also knew and I, I distinctly remember,
00:21:28.48 --> 00:21:44.16 I was probably 11 or 12 and I felt this reality that I didn't know how much time I would
00:21:44.16 --> 00:21:58.32 have in this life and that death was something that could come at any time and I knew that I, I wanted
00:21:58.32 --> 00:22:07.12 to and needed to make the most of my life and the time that I had in understanding how precious that was.
00:22:08.24 --> 00:22:13.28 Was there anything that triggered that? What did you lose? A family member? Did you see a
00:22:13.28 --> 00:22:19.12 fish die on the beach or something like that? Or was it just something that came from?
00:22:19.12 --> 00:22:27.12 I mean, it came, it came from, um, that there was no kind of external trigger.
00:22:28.16 --> 00:22:34.88 I think it really came from spending time in prayer and meditation, frankly.
00:22:34.88 --> 00:22:43.04 Because, I mean, this, this was something that, you know, God has been the center of,
00:22:43.92 --> 00:22:48.24 I mean, it's the center of my parents' marriage and it's not in a sectarian way at all,
00:22:48.24 --> 00:22:53.04 just understanding, hey, real religion is love for God and however you choose to worship at home
00:22:53.04 --> 00:22:59.84 or a church or a temple or a mosque or whatever, however you choose to develop that relationship with
00:22:59.84 --> 00:23:07.36 God that, that you're happiest, that is where you can find peace and shelter and happiness and
00:23:08.32 --> 00:23:16.40 and that, that, I think, is the foundation that allowed me at a young age to
00:23:17.44 --> 00:23:23.28 realize that truth and not in a way that like, oh my God, I'm so scared. I'm going to, like, I could
00:23:23.28 --> 00:23:31.60 die tomorrow, not, not in a fear filled way at all but rather just a sense of understanding the truth.
00:23:34.64 --> 00:23:41.28 That is not only, you know, we have no control over when our time will come and,
00:23:42.48 --> 00:23:51.92 therefore surrender that surrender to that and surrender to knowing that, hey, my life is ultimately
00:23:51.92 --> 00:24:00.48 in God's hands and also knowing that the death of this physical body does not mean the death of
00:24:00.48 --> 00:24:09.84 me, the soul within the body and therefore understanding that being free from the fear of
00:24:11.12 --> 00:24:18.32 death but understanding also how precious this life is and
00:24:18.32 --> 00:24:25.04 wanting to do my best to make sure that I didn't waste, waste it.
00:24:27.84 --> 00:24:31.84 Well, it's amazing that you and I can actually even have a conversation as to human beings
00:24:31.84 --> 00:24:36.16 because if you're talking about when you were 10 or 11 years old and you're thinking about what
00:24:36.16 --> 00:24:41.68 you were thinking about when you were 10 or 11 years old, first of all, I didn't think I could be killed
00:24:41.68 --> 00:24:48.80 and that lasted until my mid-30s, I think. And then on top of that, like, you're talking about
00:24:48.80 --> 00:24:52.80 serving people and helping people and I more than anything just wanted a machine gun.
00:24:55.84 --> 00:25:00.96 Did you, so you mentioned that that religion was part of your life? What, what,
00:25:00.96 --> 00:25:05.52 we know what religion did you get? Obviously that must have come from home because you were home
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:12.88 schooled, so as your parents, what sort of religious view did you all have? What was it?
00:25:13.68 --> 00:25:22.88 It was, it was the, I think the deepest, trueest meaning of religion itself which is
00:25:23.68 --> 00:25:31.76 is that real religion is cultivating a loving relationship with God. And so the back drop on that,
00:25:31.76 --> 00:25:40.88 which is, I appreciate so much not having, not understanding kind of what is sectarianism
00:25:43.12 --> 00:25:48.88 as a kid growing up at all. My mom grew up in a methodist family, my dad grew up in a Catholic
00:25:48.88 --> 00:25:54.96 family, my dad went to seminary for a while, he thought he wanted to become a priest and
00:25:54.96 --> 00:26:03.12 both in their own ways and ended up coming to a point separately and then later together in
00:26:05.04 --> 00:26:12.48 wanting more than they were getting from the religious or spiritual practice that they had
00:26:12.48 --> 00:26:20.40 grown up with. And like for my dad, he told me how in the seminary when he went,
00:26:20.40 --> 00:26:27.36 as a kid he had grown up memorizing a verse, I think, or a prayer that said,
00:26:28.32 --> 00:26:36.88 something like in order to be happy, one must know love and serve God. And so as a kid, he's thinking,
00:26:36.88 --> 00:26:45.68 okay, no love and serve God. In order to love, like the first step of that is you have to know God,
00:26:45.68 --> 00:26:54.96 how can I know God so that I can love and serve Him? And he asked one of the priests at the seminary
00:26:54.96 --> 00:27:04.48 that question, like, where can I where and how can I know more about God? And the priest kind of
00:27:04.48 --> 00:27:08.72 patented him on the head and he said, you know, this is a mystery, my child, this is a mystery.
00:27:09.60 --> 00:27:14.48 And so for my dad, it was like, well, I don't like that doesn't compute. How do you love someone,
00:27:14.48 --> 00:27:20.000 if you can't know who they are? And so he, like, even as, I don't know, he was a teenager,
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.16 I think at the time, that kind of planted the seed of that hunger for more knowledge and that more,
00:27:27.28 --> 00:27:34.64 you know, having the depth of that personal relationship with God. And ultimately,
00:27:35.36 --> 00:27:42.80 they both found their ways, again, through different paths to looking at, you know, Eastern,
00:27:42.80 --> 00:27:53.36 spiritual practices and meditation and found scriptures and teachings based in the Vedic
00:27:53.36 --> 00:28:00.40 scriptures, which come out of India and Hinduism. But that are also not sectarian, like you don't
00:28:00.40 --> 00:28:09.36 convert into Hinduism, you don't convert out of it. Their timeless kind of universal spiritual
00:28:09.36 --> 00:28:15.28 teachings of bhakti yoga, something called bhakti yoga and karma yoga bhakti yoga being
00:28:17.20 --> 00:28:24.16 a spiritual practice in seeking to live your life in loving service to God and karma yoga,
00:28:24.16 --> 00:28:29.68 people familiar with the word karma, which really means action and karma yoga, meaning
00:28:31.68 --> 00:28:36.08 doing your best to take actions that have a positive impact to be of service to others.
00:28:36.08 --> 00:28:46.000 And so those are the spiritual practices that I have in my life and that I was introduced to
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.80 from a really young age. So it's not, it's a very long answer to your question, but it's not
00:28:52.80 --> 00:28:59.04 about, like it wasn't, like we went to bed. My mom would say the Lord's prayer and read stories
00:28:59.04 --> 00:29:04.96 about, you know, Krishna from the Bhagavad-gita. You know, we'd watch Jesus of Nazareth, like
00:29:04.96 --> 00:29:10.72 1600 times because that was one of the few movies we were allowed to watch as kids going up. And,
00:29:12.32 --> 00:29:19.28 you know, celebrate celebrations like John Mastamy, which is which is the celebration of the
00:29:19.28 --> 00:29:23.84 appearance of Krishna in this world over 5,000 years ago and celebrate Christmas and set up
00:29:23.84 --> 00:29:33.04 the nativity scene and sing Christmas carols and there was never ever any sense of contradiction
00:29:33.04 --> 00:29:38.88 or having to choose one or the other. And we go to Mass with my grandmother when she came to town
00:29:38.88 --> 00:29:44.88 and go to, and there was no contradiction because frankly, when you get right to the heart of it,
00:29:44.88 --> 00:29:52.96 once you get past all the all of the unfortunate, like bureaucracy and divisiveness that exists too
00:29:52.96 --> 00:29:58.000 often that create conflict amongst people of different spiritual practices, you just get to the
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.92 heart of it. What is it? It is about loving God and whether you call God Krishna or Al-Ala or Jehovah,
00:30:04.64 --> 00:30:11.52 God has many names. There's one God. He has many names and it doesn't matter. None of that none of
00:30:11.52 --> 00:30:19.36 none of the superficial matters if in your heart you're doing your best to love God and to serve him.
00:30:19.36 --> 00:30:29.28 And so that's that I'm grateful to have been able to realize myself from a relatively young age
00:30:29.28 --> 00:30:39.04 and knew that that is how I wanted to live my life. So how did you end up with, so you have this
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.68 really kind of heavy spiritual background? What, where were you grounded to like interacting with
00:30:47.68 --> 00:30:55.60 other kids who are jerks? And it seems like you could be sort of a a little bit sheltered in this
00:30:55.60 --> 00:30:58.96 world. I could be totally wrong, but it seems like if that's the way you're raised and all of a
00:30:58.96 --> 00:31:04.48 sudden you go down to the market and someone says, you know, get out of my way, you know, you
00:31:04.48 --> 00:31:10.88 little brat or whatever, how did you, what was the, how did you interact with the rest of the
00:31:10.88 --> 00:31:16.16 world when you were in this stage of life? Yeah, you know, we weren't, we weren't sheltered to kind of
00:31:16.16 --> 00:31:22.88 closed off. We had a lot of, you know, there's a lot of kids in the neighborhood and we, you know,
00:31:22.88 --> 00:31:27.28 oftentimes like my mom was the head cook at the restaurant and so she'd go in it like two in the
00:31:27.28 --> 00:31:30.88 morning to start cooking, we'd go in with my sister and I'd go with my dad a little later on,
00:31:30.88 --> 00:31:36.08 we do school in the office with him and then spend the rest of the day, like either wiping tables
00:31:36.08 --> 00:31:41.44 or hanging out with customers and just talking story and and like that that was a little bit of a
00:31:41.44 --> 00:31:49.12 second home for us, you know, did gymnastics, did martial arts, did did all the things and, you know,
00:31:49.12 --> 00:31:58.88 there was no, there was no, I don't know, separation or anything like that. Yeah, no, so it sounds
00:31:58.88 --> 00:32:03.04 like there was balance and, and you know, working at a restaurant, that's what I should have put
00:32:03.04 --> 00:32:06.000 that together because when you're working at a restaurant, you got customers, you got people,
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.72 people that are happy, people that are sad, people that are mad, people that are going to tell
00:32:08.72 --> 00:32:11.84 you to, you know, go screw yourself and that you're sandwiched suck, then people that are like,
00:32:11.84 --> 00:32:16.56 oh, this is wonderful and you get all those people. Yeah. So you learn a lot about the world and so that's
00:32:16.56 --> 00:32:22.16 a good, that's a good balance. Very much so, very much so. So sports, you just mentioned kind of like
00:32:22.16 --> 00:32:28.72 no big deal martial arts gymnastics, how into you are, how into you are, how into all of that where
00:32:28.72 --> 00:32:36.80 you? Very much so. I loved, I loved gymnastics until I started a sucks, I got really like too big,
00:32:36.80 --> 00:32:46.40 I think I started to grow. And then I, I transitioned, I was definitely more of, I, you know,
00:32:46.40 --> 00:32:54.80 tried ballet as a little girl too and me and ballet didn't jive so well. So my sister was definitely
00:32:54.80 --> 00:33:02.32 more of like the, the, the, the ballerina type and I don't know, I, I just, it's not not so much
00:33:02.32 --> 00:33:09.04 my, my flavor. So, um, I, I definitely gravitated towards martial arts and earliest did, um,
00:33:09.04 --> 00:33:18.32 Taekwondo and started learning Tai Chi and, um, uh, owing chan and, um, Filipino stick fighting,
00:33:18.32 --> 00:33:24.88 Arneis and so got got introduced to a lot of different types of martial arts and I was that kid that
00:33:25.28 --> 00:33:31.44 was told like, okay, if you want to like, toughen yourself up, you need to go across a street to the park
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:40.16 and kick a tree trunk over and over, it's like, sweet. Awesome. I was the kid that, and maybe Echo
00:33:40.16 --> 00:33:46.48 can relate, I'd never liked wearing shoes and would purposely like we go hiking up a mountain
00:33:46.48 --> 00:33:52.40 and I'd be like, shoes, shoes are for weak people. I need to make my feet tough because I don't
00:33:52.40 --> 00:34:00.64 want howlty feet. So that was kind of me growing up and, um, and maybe, you know, having three
00:34:00.64 --> 00:34:07.92 older brothers who who had a lot of fun, um, making me and my sister do really stupid, uh,
00:34:08.24 --> 00:34:13.04 tortures a strong word, but, you know, we're called them challenges. Yeah, let's call him challenges.
00:34:13.04 --> 00:34:18.88 Challenges that really had no good outcome one way or the other for us. Other than being tough.
00:34:20.24 --> 00:34:24.88 Other than being tough. Yeah. Uh, have you been to your somebody? I have not. I forget which
00:34:24.88 --> 00:34:30.88 I get was, but, you know, my son was the same way, like no shoes ever. Uh-huh. And we liked one of
00:34:30.88 --> 00:34:35.68 the legit hikes at YoSemite. It just a day hike, but, you know, many thousands of feet
00:34:35.68 --> 00:34:40.64 of altitude and many miles of walking and he did a bare feet barefoot and people were walking
00:34:40.64 --> 00:34:45.68 by him and they're just disturbed. They're looking at me like a horse that he's like, you're
00:34:45.68 --> 00:34:51.44 tired. He did it. It was literally no factor for him. I mean, a zero factor because the kid would
00:34:51.44 --> 00:34:57.36 never wear shoes ever. So that, and, you know, the kid's got tough feet. He can sprint on just
00:34:57.36 --> 00:35:03.44 gravel. Yeah. You know, are you feet still tough? Probably not as tough just because, you know,
00:35:03.44 --> 00:35:09.60 like, have to wear like a suit and heels and all those things for work. That was an adjustment.
00:35:10.88 --> 00:35:13.36 Now your feet don't eat. I know. I have work to do.
00:35:15.36 --> 00:35:18.32 Where was this? By the way, what part of the law? Did you go?
00:35:18.32 --> 00:35:25.60 So my sister was born in Wahihuah and that's relive that, but most of my childhood was in Kalihi Valley
00:35:27.20 --> 00:35:35.92 and then later later was like a downtown. On a little, a little diverse, little, little slice of each,
00:35:35.92 --> 00:35:41.92 each of the different kind of cultures and communities on Oahu. Yeah. What year did you graduate
00:35:41.92 --> 00:35:50.56 then from high school or graduate from homeschool? That would have been like, I lend 97, I think.
00:35:51.12 --> 00:35:54.56 Okay. So you get done with high school then what, what are you doing?
00:35:57.04 --> 00:35:59.44 So I had started an environmental nonprofit.
00:35:59.44 --> 00:36:08.16 Spirituality done pay the rent. Fortunately, so I worked that out. I had, so I had started
00:36:08.16 --> 00:36:17.68 a co-founded environmental nonprofit called Healthy Hawaii Coalition. Maybe I was 16 or 17 and I was
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:23.36 thinking about, I figured out like, okay, you know, we're going and doing beach cleanups on the weekends
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:28.32 and every weekend we come back and there's more trash on the beach. Like how do we start to try to
00:36:28.32 --> 00:36:35.36 solve deeper problem and and came up with an idea of going and talking elementary school kids about like,
00:36:35.36 --> 00:36:42.000 hey guys, here's why you shouldn't throw your soda can and your chip bag on the beach because
00:36:42.80 --> 00:36:48.000 this is our home, this is our playground and here's what happens when you when you do that and
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.08 and I came up with like a fun little skit called the Adventures of Water Woman
00:36:54.72 --> 00:36:59.04 and a friend of mine who's an artist came up with like a workbook and a coloring book for
00:36:59.04 --> 00:37:03.84 kids and I thought elementary because you know, obviously kids are starting to figure things out
00:37:03.84 --> 00:37:11.44 and yeah, so we had this, this two-day program one day was the skit and the workbook and then the
00:37:11.44 --> 00:37:16.80 next day we actually took kids out to like a field trip in like testing water and understanding like,
00:37:16.80 --> 00:37:22.56 okay, here's like clean water versus dirty water and why and how it gets contaminated,
00:37:23.12 --> 00:37:28.88 but in a very simple practical way that they could really relate to in their lives and so I was the
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:34.72 original water woman had like the blueboard shorts and the cape with the big water drop on the back and
00:37:35.04 --> 00:37:40.08 it was so much fun. There they exist, there there may even be a video somewhere, I don't know,
00:37:41.60 --> 00:37:48.48 so it was water woman and her nemesis was oily ale and the skit was really a day in the life of
00:37:48.48 --> 00:37:54.32 oily ale and you know he'd be out there like you know throwing his trash out on the street or
00:37:54.32 --> 00:37:59.84 changing the oil in his car and then dumping the dirty oil down a storm drain, you know,
00:37:59.84 --> 00:38:05.92 dumping a bunch of pesticides and his garden and every step of the way, water woman comes in just
00:38:05.92 --> 00:38:11.68 a lick of time and saves the day and tells oily ale like if you dump your dirty car oil down
00:38:11.68 --> 00:38:16.72 the storm drain it's gonna kill all the fish in the water and you know what until the kids
00:38:16.72 --> 00:38:22.64 when you go surfing the water's gonna be really gross and it was just the coolest thing to
00:38:22.64 --> 00:38:28.16 like see all these kids sit in cross like it on the ground like you know for a second, third graders
00:38:28.88 --> 00:38:34.72 and seeing kind of like the light bulb go off in their eyes because these were examples that they could
00:38:35.04 --> 00:38:41.20 understand and relate to and that was my hope in doing this was that you know it would at least
00:38:41.20 --> 00:38:48.08 plan to seed for them to understand and appreciate their consequences to your actions and
00:38:48.08 --> 00:38:56.08 and we care very much about our home and so stop and think for a minute before you do something
00:38:56.08 --> 00:39:00.32 or if you see uncle or auntie like auntie don't throw your trash out the car window
00:39:01.76 --> 00:39:08.000 and and be able to start to make more of a you know I don't behave your all kind of change and
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.20 impact to protect our home. Did you get these you know what now was your dad with your dad
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:21.60 was in politics it's some level in Hawaii wasn't he he he and I might the first person our
00:39:21.60 --> 00:39:27.68 family who ran actually ran for office is my mom she ran for board of education. I think it was
00:39:27.68 --> 00:39:36.32 and yeah I was in 2000 okay so so the water woman that was pre-dated that yeah that's just
00:39:36.32 --> 00:39:42.32 but that's what inspired me eventually like it got to a point where and and and healthy Hawaii
00:39:42.32 --> 00:39:49.52 coalition still exists today there are other waterwoman have kind of come after me but she's still
00:39:49.52 --> 00:39:57.20 out there but it got to a point where I so I started going to community college and with the
00:39:57.20 --> 00:40:03.36 aim of working in the TV and film industry, Leeward Community College and started in the TV
00:40:03.36 --> 00:40:07.68 and film production course out there and then was going to transfer to a mainland school
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:17.36 to be able to continue continue that kind of education but a couple of things happen my financial
00:40:17.36 --> 00:40:23.36 aid package fell through and I couldn't afford it to come to the mainland and so and then the
00:40:23.36 --> 00:40:32.40 other thing was just there there was an open seat in the state legislature where I lived and I
00:40:32.40 --> 00:40:41.84 I've you know I started to think about okay I have an opportunity here to stand on the outside
00:40:41.84 --> 00:40:46.56 and there were other things you know we they wanted to build a huge land fill over one of our
00:40:46.56 --> 00:40:52.32 biggest water aquifers and Hawaii all of our our water comes from groundwater so you know I
00:40:52.32 --> 00:40:56.80 and a whole bunch of other people we went out and got petitions and we organized and ultimately
00:40:56.80 --> 00:41:04.08 thankfully were able to get that that project cancelled but it got as far as it did because of a politician
00:41:04.08 --> 00:41:10.08 who was kind of in the pocket of the landfill company and so I started to think you know I can
00:41:10.08 --> 00:41:17.12 I can stand on the outside and hold a sign or circulate a petition or I can try to put myself in a
00:41:17.12 --> 00:41:23.92 position of influence and decision making to directly impact a lot of these environmental issues that
00:41:23.92 --> 00:41:29.76 I really cared a lot about and that's what led me to run for state house in 2002
00:41:31.20 --> 00:41:36.48 my house were you I was 21 and my dad that was the first that my dad ran for city council that
00:41:36.48 --> 00:41:41.52 same year so it was kind of it was kind of fun for us to share a few ran for city council on why and I
00:41:42.48 --> 00:41:48.80 and I was running for state house in Ever Beach and so our districts like they didn't overlap really
00:41:48.80 --> 00:41:55.52 but they were adjacent to each other but every morning it was like okay my mom would back a lunch and
00:41:57.76 --> 00:42:02.32 send him out and I went out and we were sign waving every day and knocking on doors every day for
00:42:02.32 --> 00:42:10.08 for months but that was that was both of our introduction into running for office at the same time and it
00:42:10.08 --> 00:42:16.96 was for me it was a totally it was a totally foreign experience because I had no
00:42:16.96 --> 00:42:23.76 formal education in it I was not a part of a debate team had not been trained to public speak in
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:34.40 any way at all and on top of all of that total 100% introvert like you know I had my
00:42:34.40 --> 00:42:42.40 circle of friends growing up but I was I was so shy and I was fine with it because I just hung
00:42:42.40 --> 00:42:49.76 out with who I wanted to hang out with but anybody outside of that I would not I wouldn't talk to people
00:42:50.32 --> 00:42:57.12 I'd make my sister go out and talk to people and I'd read books and do my martial arts and yoga and just do
00:42:57.12 --> 00:43:05.44 do my thing and so to then put choose to put myself in a position where I'd have to learn how to
00:43:05.44 --> 00:43:10.72 give speeches I'd have to figure out how to pick up the phone and call total strangers which was
00:43:10.72 --> 00:43:16.32 anxiety inducing in and of itself but not only do that but ask them like hey would you like to donate
00:43:16.32 --> 00:43:22.96 to my campaign for a state house to then go like I would never forget the first day I went to go
00:43:22.96 --> 00:43:28.32 knock on doors like I knew enough about I'd done enough research to know okay if I'm going to run
00:43:28.32 --> 00:43:32.72 for this seat I'm going to run to win and in order to do that I have to convince
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:39.84 this many people to vote for me in order to win this race so I had I had the math figured out and I had the
00:43:39.84 --> 00:43:47.92 voting list people's addresses and names and literally got on the computer made like this black and
00:43:47.92 --> 00:43:54.80 white kind of janky brochure saying this is who I am and so I had you know copies of that that I
00:43:54.80 --> 00:44:02.80 went and made at the copy shop and and I sat in my car it's like a aquacolored geometro two-door
00:44:02.80 --> 00:44:15.76 geometro on old evabito in in white pahoo and it took me about 30 minutes in the car to
00:44:15.76 --> 00:44:22.48 summon up the courage to go knock on that first door and I was terrified absolutely terrified just
00:44:22.48 --> 00:44:28.64 thinking of every scenario that could possibly go wrong but also like what are the first words
00:44:28.64 --> 00:44:33.68 that need to come out of my mouth and then what if they ask me this question what if I don't know the
00:44:33.68 --> 00:44:40.32 answer just all of these different things and and like one knocked on the first door and like just
00:44:40.32 --> 00:44:45.76 wonderful old Filipino lady answered the door and she's like hey how are you just wonderfully kind
00:44:45.76 --> 00:44:50.32 and probably offered me a glass of water and like the whole thing's like oh my god okay
00:44:51.44 --> 00:44:55.04 then went through the whole scenario all over again for the next door
00:44:55.04 --> 00:45:04.16 wholesome like every single door was was a major obstacle for me and ultimately like why put
00:45:04.16 --> 00:45:10.08 myself through this and and how did I get through it it really just it that groundedness and
00:45:10.08 --> 00:45:15.76 and the ability to step way outside of anything I was comfortable with came from
00:45:17.36 --> 00:45:22.32 that that desire to serve and knowing that ultimately keeping reminding myself ultimately like
00:45:22.32 --> 00:45:28.16 why do you care so much about yourself this is not about you if you wanted to do something for
00:45:28.16 --> 00:45:33.84 yourself you would certainly not be doing this you'd be out surfing right now and and that was
00:45:34.96 --> 00:45:43.12 that was my introduction into into elected politics sir you won did your dad win I won and he won
00:45:44.16 --> 00:45:49.60 and my mom my mom was serving she served one for your term in the board of education so for two
00:45:49.60 --> 00:45:57.44 years from 2002 to four the three of us were all like in serving in different buildings all in the
00:45:57.44 --> 00:46:03.92 same kind of you know quarter quarter mile quarter square mile area and one of those it was fun
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:10.32 and and obviously you liked it it's on level you liked the impact that you were able to have
00:46:11.20 --> 00:46:17.92 because you you carried on with this sort of yeah it it life I never once thought
00:46:17.92 --> 00:46:24.56 you know when I won that election it was a five way democratic primary first that I had to
00:46:24.56 --> 00:46:34.48 get through and then a general election that I got through I yes I liked the impact but I never
00:46:35.20 --> 00:46:41.84 once thought that I want to have a career quote unquote career in politics I was absolutely
00:46:41.84 --> 00:46:46.16 not attached to that I thought okay hey this is something I can do now and I'll make the most of it
00:46:46.16 --> 00:46:53.12 and then you know we'll see we'll see where it goes and I ended up serving just one term
00:46:54.16 --> 00:47:01.76 there because of Iraq so when did you when did September 11 happen
00:47:03.04 --> 00:47:12.000 or where were you at the time so I was I was just starting my my campaign to run for the
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.80 statehouse when that happened and at what point did you decide you wanted to enlist the National
00:47:20.80 --> 00:47:33.92 Garden Hawaii I I knew in some way when 911 happened and obviously we're in Hawaii you know we're
00:47:33.92 --> 00:47:44.48 six hours behind New York on that day so we woke up to turning on the news and it had already
00:47:44.48 --> 00:47:56.64 happened and you know I think like like everybody in our country it was it it deeply impacted me
00:47:56.64 --> 00:48:07.12 in a way that I felt almost right away that I wanted to do something to to to go after and defeat
00:48:07.12 --> 00:48:15.68 the terrorist that attacked us then I just didn't quite know exactly how to do that because I was
00:48:15.68 --> 00:48:21.68 I had already made a decision to pursue this particular path of of being able to serve Hawaii
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:31.84 and so eventually eventually I felt that that I had learned about the National Garden what
00:48:31.84 --> 00:48:36.96 it's about and you know serve your state and it's time of need but also be ready to stand up
00:48:36.96 --> 00:48:45.44 and serve your country and and decided to enlist in early 2003 because I felt that would be
00:48:45.44 --> 00:48:52.56 a way that I could accomplish both objectives essentially did you have familiarization with the
00:48:52.56 --> 00:48:58.56 military because of your grandfather that had spent his whole career in the army and in the air force
00:48:58.56 --> 00:49:04.80 oh we you really just just through stories he passed away while I was still relatively young and and
00:49:04.80 --> 00:49:09.04 because they he and my grandmother lived in Samoa we didn't get a ton of time together
00:49:09.04 --> 00:49:16.40 um my dad had had and his high school best friend had tried to enlist to serve in Vietnam
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:24.32 they had both gone to I guess it would have been maps or some sort of version of it and they both
00:49:24.32 --> 00:49:29.68 walked in together and went into different rooms to go through all the medical exams and stuff
00:49:29.68 --> 00:49:38.000 he wanted to be a medic and when they came out my dad had been rejected for medical reasons it may have
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.28 been flat feet or something like that and he was he was totally heartbroken but his best friend
00:49:43.28 --> 00:49:49.04 came out and was enlisted and so ended up going and serving in Vietnam but there's something that my
00:49:49.04 --> 00:49:59.60 dad always wished that he had been able to do just to to be able to serve and so that was
00:49:59.60 --> 00:50:05.28 that was pretty much the most of my personal no no one else in my family might some my uncles had
00:50:05.28 --> 00:50:08.56 served but again we're in Hawaii so like we don't you know they we don't get to see him or
00:50:08.56 --> 00:50:14.96 hang out with them that much so you show up to boop you go to boop camp yeah I had I was in the
00:50:14.96 --> 00:50:20.72 state legislature at the time and so I had to I you know took the asvab and everything and recruiters
00:50:20.72 --> 00:50:25.68 like yeah you can you can have whatever job you want just tell me what you want to do and
00:50:25.68 --> 00:50:31.68 literally made the decision as like look my session has done on this date and then I got to be
00:50:31.68 --> 00:50:38.72 back by this date so find me a basic training and an AIT that can fit within these like this five
00:50:38.72 --> 00:50:49.04 month period I got to knock it all out at once and so I ended up in a like medical uh I don't
00:50:49.04 --> 00:50:53.36 operations or something like that because the AIT was only seven weeks long I had I was like
00:50:53.36 --> 00:50:57.68 I want to do like uh it was a combat journalism or something like that but you got to go to school
00:50:57.68 --> 00:51:03.04 for six months or whatever but so I shipped out right after the legislative session was done
00:51:03.04 --> 00:51:08.56 and I listed on the actually on the floor of the state house and uh I went to Fort Jackson
00:51:08.56 --> 00:51:19.28 the summer of 2003 um managed to um not get noticed by the drill sergeants for my political job
00:51:19.28 --> 00:51:27.60 until like a week seven of nine which I was pretty happy about and only got found out because
00:51:27.60 --> 00:51:37.76 um uh me and my my assigned battle buddy um we were pulling duty at like the battalion headquarters
00:51:37.76 --> 00:51:44.88 one afternoon like watching the door whatever it was and the battalion star major walked in
00:51:45.84 --> 00:51:53.36 and did what sergeant majors do like hey private how are you and where do you come from and
00:51:53.36 --> 00:51:57.60 what did you do before you join the army and you know that whole conversation and so he talked
00:51:57.60 --> 00:52:03.28 to my battle buddy first and she told him she was from the Midwest and she's like yeah so you know
00:52:03.28 --> 00:52:08.24 I was working at McDonald's and decided to join the military and this is what I want to do and
00:52:08.24 --> 00:52:14.64 he's like oh you know that's great it's great and what about you it's like oh yeah I'm from Hawaii
00:52:14.64 --> 00:52:20.96 and um I'm a state representative there and you know this is what I want to do and and he just
00:52:20.96 --> 00:52:27.76 looked at me he's like wait you said what you do what he's like how come I don't know about this
00:52:27.76 --> 00:52:34.32 he asked me that how come I don't know about this like I don't I don't know uh I you know
00:52:34.32 --> 00:52:40.64 the in-processing paperwork that says what is your civilian occupation I wrote it down and
00:52:40.64 --> 00:52:47.20 and turned it in but you know who's your drill sergeant and I knew it would all down he'll
00:52:47.20 --> 00:52:55.36 he'll fall down hill for me from there going from Hawaii going from like the kind of cruising mode
00:52:55.36 --> 00:53:00.40 of Hawaii yeah which I know it sounds like there's there's a little bit of well there's there's
00:53:00.40 --> 00:53:04.56 also like this whole competitive thing with your family and you're obviously we're driven because
00:53:04.56 --> 00:53:10.000 you're out creating these things and running for office and all this but I mean all of a sudden
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.12 you're in boot camp was it a shock of course yeah I mean it's I'd be worried if it was
00:53:17.12 --> 00:53:26.40 a shock but I'm really you know I'm happy that I went in with the perspective of at least just
00:53:26.40 --> 00:53:33.44 understanding that whatever the madness is there's a purpose to it and don't get I I just I've
00:53:33.44 --> 00:53:38.32 never I've always been a pretty chill person and I don't get freaked out by that much and
00:53:40.24 --> 00:53:46.40 yeah so yeah I actually in a very weird and twisted way really loved it it was it was the
00:53:46.40 --> 00:53:52.32 camaraderie and the kind of bond that that is built in a very short period of time with a whole
00:53:52.32 --> 00:53:58.56 bunch of strangers from all over the country knowing that and appreciating that like all of us
00:53:58.56 --> 00:54:02.08 are there for the same reason all of us are there for the same purpose whatever the motivating
00:54:02.08 --> 00:54:09.84 decision was to unless really didn't matter that you know we all were the same uniform and all
00:54:09.84 --> 00:54:15.52 the same team it was it was I loved it how long after you got back from boot camp and AIT was it
00:54:15.52 --> 00:54:23.60 that you went on your first deployment came back home at the end of 2003 from training and then
00:54:23.60 --> 00:54:28.88 the 29th Brigade Combat Team from the Hawaii National Guard was activated I want to say
00:54:29.68 --> 00:54:38.24 the notification came out in the summer of 2004 I was campaigning for my reelection at that
00:54:38.24 --> 00:54:48.24 point in time and remember going in and and taking a break from knocking on doors knocking on doors
00:54:48.24 --> 00:54:55.36 again and I got an email at home check my email at home and and got the notification of the deployment
00:54:56.08 --> 00:55:03.12 but I was not on the I was not on the deployment roster because they they already had somebody who
00:55:03.12 --> 00:55:08.96 filled you know that job in the medical in the field medical company and so I immediately called my
00:55:08.96 --> 00:55:14.96 commander and just said hey like what's what's the deal here I don't see my name on the roster
00:55:14.96 --> 00:55:20.16 I said tell see congratulations like you get to stay home you don't have to go and
00:55:21.92 --> 00:55:30.72 that bothered me a lot and I just said no I just you know I knew that there was no I could stay back
00:55:30.72 --> 00:55:40.80 and that to you know sitting my office in the state capital and watch everybody leave was not an option
00:55:40.80 --> 00:55:49.52 for me and so I continued the conversation with my my commander and I just said sir I'm going
00:55:50.88 --> 00:55:55.84 tell me what job I need to get trained in that you need filled so that I can go and that's
00:55:55.84 --> 00:56:01.76 that's that's what happened so I I kind of I I publicly withdrew from my reelection campaign
00:56:01.76 --> 00:56:05.60 it was too like to take my name off the ballot but told everybody like I'm not I'm not running for
00:56:05.60 --> 00:56:15.12 reelection volunteer to fill this position and we left restarted our active duty train up I think
00:56:15.12 --> 00:56:22.88 it was in August of of that year 2004 and then we were in country in early January 2005
00:56:22.88 --> 00:56:28.72 what job did you get trained for what job what bill did you do I it was medical logistics
00:56:29.92 --> 00:56:36.64 so supply which and you know specialist at this point yeah I was in the for kind of a fresh
00:56:36.64 --> 00:56:46.08 e-for and as as you know like okay I filled I filled the position but once we actually got there
00:56:46.08 --> 00:56:53.92 I ended up becoming I ended up filling a position that was previously held by an E7
00:56:54.80 --> 00:57:02.96 as the brigade surgeon operations person and so kind of was working you know like line of duty
00:57:02.96 --> 00:57:11.76 paperwork and injuries and tracking supplies for all of our medics and docs and PA's who were
00:57:11.76 --> 00:57:20.88 attached to all of like the infantry units and and and also every day just tracking going through
00:57:20.88 --> 00:57:26.48 going through the the report every day for our our brigade commander of looking
00:57:26.48 --> 00:57:31.84 name by name down this list of of casualties that had occurred in the previous 24 hours to
00:57:33.20 --> 00:57:40.32 see if there was anyone there from our nearly 3000 person brigade and make sure that they were
00:57:40.32 --> 00:57:46.48 getting taken care of whether in country to stay in country or getting evacuated and staying with
00:57:46.48 --> 00:57:52.40 them and tracking their care every step of the way until eventually they made their way home.
00:57:53.20 --> 00:57:59.20 Where were you actually stationed in Iraq? We were in a balad in L.A. Anaconda,
00:58:00.08 --> 00:58:04.48 most of us were there that was kind of the base and then we had units in camp victory and Baghdad
00:58:04.48 --> 00:58:13.04 and in a couple other kind of smaller fobs out in different areas and so I moved around a little bit
00:58:13.04 --> 00:58:19.28 kind of going out and visiting some of our units and checking in on them where they you know
00:58:19.28 --> 00:58:24.24 where they were but that was that was primarily where I spent most of the time. And how did you
00:58:24.96 --> 00:58:30.72 what was that deployment like from you know your perspective now looking back? What kind of lessons
00:58:30.72 --> 00:58:41.12 did you bring back? What did you learn from that deployment to Iraq? A lot. Yeah I came back
00:58:42.24 --> 00:58:48.80 and my family told me this after I don't think I fully realized how much I had changed
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.52 but it was something that they immediately noticed in coming back just
00:58:57.52 --> 00:59:11.44 more sober and more focused and that really came from you know I talked a little bit about how
00:59:11.44 --> 00:59:15.52 realizing from a young age like death can come at any moment well that's that's a philosophical
00:59:15.52 --> 00:59:27.28 realization and being there that became very real very quickly and you know there there was
00:59:27.28 --> 00:59:32.08 have you been there did you ever pass through there when I went to Belad I'd be there for like 20 minutes
00:59:32.08 --> 00:59:36.48 and go to a meeting and leave so I barely remember anything about Belad. And did you come in
00:59:36.48 --> 00:59:43.76 like vehicle or hardware? Yeah so there was within the first couple of days of us arriving there it's a big
00:59:43.76 --> 00:59:50.000 camp massive and so you know kind of was going out and like okay orienting myself where is everything at
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.36 and I noticed right away at the north gate of that camp at least at that time I don't know if it's
00:59:55.36 --> 01:00:02.64 still there but there was a big there's a big huge sign that someone had put up on you know that you
01:00:02.64 --> 01:00:06.24 would see every time you leave camp out through the north gate which is where most of our patrols
01:00:07.44 --> 01:00:15.20 use that gate that the sign red is today the day and I just remember being stopped in my tracks
01:00:15.20 --> 01:00:24.80 and just take it a minute to to to to take that in and the meaning of it so that none of us would ever
01:00:24.80 --> 01:00:38.72 forget that today could be the day and that that was the welcome message and it really
01:00:40.48 --> 01:00:51.36 it hit home so much in in that daily task that I had of actually seeing names of people who I never
01:00:51.36 --> 01:00:55.84 knew people in different parts of of of of of serving different parts of the country but also
01:00:55.84 --> 01:01:00.64 people who I did know whose names would pop up on that list every single day that I went through
01:01:02.32 --> 01:01:09.60 and recognizing again how precious life is and any any any any any moment
01:01:11.60 --> 01:01:18.80 you know that that could be your last and then of course we we had unfortunately you know we lost
01:01:18.80 --> 01:01:26.96 a lot of people during that deployment and to me it it it really it it changed everything for
01:01:26.96 --> 01:01:38.08 me because ultimately coming home I knew there was absolutely no way that I could just go back
01:01:38.08 --> 01:01:42.32 to the life that I had left behind as though I didn't just experience like the people like
01:01:42.32 --> 01:01:45.36 oh you're gonna go back and run if you're sitting the state legislates you're gonna pick this up
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:51.60 and kind of like hit the play button on my life that had been paused and it was impossible I
01:01:51.60 --> 01:01:57.76 didn't even think about it because I knew that somehow this experience that I had had I wanted
01:01:57.76 --> 01:02:06.72 I wanted to do something positive with it in being able to impact the kinds of decisions
01:02:06.72 --> 01:02:16.80 that took us all to that war in the first place so then so then what was the next move when
01:02:16.80 --> 01:02:21.84 you get home it's two is it now two thousand six yeah so we were in country for a year
01:02:22.64 --> 01:02:29.68 and then you know had the demobilization when we came back and so it was 2006 and I was trying to figure
01:02:29.68 --> 01:02:34.56 out okay what am I going to do there was no obvious answer to the question that I was asking
01:02:34.56 --> 01:02:40.32 which was how can I you know how can I take this and turn it into something positive
01:02:41.52 --> 01:02:46.80 ultimately I ended up volunteering our one of our US senators from Hawaii at that time
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000 Senator Akaka was being challenged in a primary election which kind of unheard of
01:02:55.60 --> 01:03:03.36 the power of incumbency is very real plus he's like the kindest most Aloha guy you will
01:03:03.36 --> 01:03:09.04 ever ever meet in your entire life no one has a bad thing to say about him but he got this
01:03:09.04 --> 01:03:13.20 challenge that came out of nowhere and I didn't know him at all personally had no personal
01:03:13.20 --> 01:03:23.60 relationship whatsoever the guy challenging him I did have some some interaction with
01:03:24.32 --> 01:03:30.56 that was not positive and so I was I was like okay I'm going to go volunteer full-time for Senator
01:03:30.56 --> 01:03:40.40 Akaka make sure that that he wins his reelection and he did and he I don't know if he was
01:03:40.40 --> 01:03:46.000 already or I think he was after the reelection he became the chairman of the US Committee for
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.68 Veterans Affairs and so after volunteering on the campaign as Chief of Staff said hey do you want
01:03:51.68 --> 01:03:57.76 to come and work in Washington and as a legislative aid and help him with that work on the committee
01:03:57.76 --> 01:04:03.20 and you know environment and energy natural resource few other areas and so that's what I did
01:04:03.20 --> 01:04:06.96 and that up going and working with him in Washington for a couple of years
01:04:09.52 --> 01:04:17.36 went through OCS while I was there and how did you get an OCS billet did you graduate college
01:04:17.36 --> 01:04:27.52 somewhere along the way good question I forgot about that fire I was working I was I
01:04:27.52 --> 01:04:35.36 was while in Iraq working on my degree going on the education center tent and you know like okay
01:04:35.36 --> 01:04:39.76 sometimes you got mortars coming in and the alarm sounds you got to go in the bunker and come back out
01:04:39.76 --> 01:04:47.28 and say I was I was continuing my education while I was there and I had gotten just enough credits
01:04:47.28 --> 01:04:53.44 needed 60 credits go to OCS and I had just enough credits to go and I was still working on my
01:04:53.44 --> 01:04:57.36 degree when I was in DC and I was you know working there and so I was kind of working full time
01:04:57.36 --> 01:05:04.88 into school at night but yeah split in split in and then got I think you needed 90 credits to get
01:05:04.88 --> 01:05:11.36 your commission or something like that. I still have to keep squeak in about. Yeah so I just
01:05:12.08 --> 01:05:21.60 barely squeaked by. It's been um so you got to OCS is it anything anything shocking about OCS anything
01:05:21.60 --> 01:05:28.72 that was I loved I I knew obviously OCS is to train leaders but I didn't know going in
01:05:30.64 --> 01:05:34.40 the depth of that and that was why that was why I wanted to go through OCS and I graduated from
01:05:34.40 --> 01:05:40.16 basic training I was like I want to be the sergeant major the army one day all about it and then you
01:05:40.16 --> 01:05:46.08 know I got a deployment under my belt and got to witness some some examples of great leadership
01:05:46.08 --> 01:05:51.20 also some examples of leaders that were lacking in a lot of areas and and especially in a
01:05:51.20 --> 01:05:57.44 deployed deployed setting in a dangerous way and that was that that made a major impact for me
01:05:57.44 --> 01:06:03.60 coming back to say okay you know I same thing like I can complain about having shitty leaders
01:06:03.60 --> 01:06:11.84 or I can actually go and try to be be a good leader of soldiers and and I love and I tell kids
01:06:11.84 --> 01:06:16.48 who come and ask me like hey I think I want to join the military coming off sir very biased
01:06:16.48 --> 01:06:22.40 yes you can go do the West Point thing and that's great highly highly highly recommend OCS
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:32.48 because it is it is intense it is relatively short and it is just like it is it is the essentials
01:06:32.48 --> 01:06:39.44 of provide it it provides you with the essential tools to to begin your leadership path
01:06:40.16 --> 01:06:46.40 and I just I loved it so much that I ended up going back as a tack officer after I had
01:06:46.40 --> 01:06:50.48 gotten a deployment as a platoon leader under my belt and then I loved it even more.
01:06:53.68 --> 01:06:58.80 How long is this how long is our OCS? So there's the active duty army OCS at
01:06:58.80 --> 01:07:06.80 for betting which is I think three maybe between three and four months. I went through an accelerated
01:07:06.80 --> 01:07:15.04 National Guard OCS in Alabama at Fort McClullin that uses the same program of instruction as the
01:07:15.04 --> 01:07:22.40 Fort Bending Program but just condenses it down to I think it was maybe ten weeks and the
01:07:22.40 --> 01:07:27.36 like the difference is like they get weekends off at Fort Bending like they get to use computers
01:07:27.36 --> 01:07:33.04 and phones and like that and we got none of that it was it was seven days a week you know
01:07:33.04 --> 01:07:40.80 for am to midnight all operators like no access to technology whatsoever so everything you were doing
01:07:40.80 --> 01:07:46.000 it was like you're writing it you're writing your your six-page operator yourself and
01:07:47.28 --> 01:07:52.80 you know it sucked as you're going through it of course but you know I'm old enough now
01:07:52.80 --> 01:07:57.84 I'm approaching 18 years now in the army reserves and so I'm like one of those old people
01:07:57.84 --> 01:08:05.12 is like man you guys got so good now back in the day back in the day
01:08:05.12 --> 01:08:12.08 you uh so then you go on another deployment and this time you go too quick you're in quite
01:08:12.08 --> 01:08:17.60 that time yeah yeah we were it was a different it was a different mission for the brigade and kind
01:08:17.60 --> 01:08:23.36 of each of the battalions were tasked out in in a lot of different areas a lot of our our infantry
01:08:23.36 --> 01:08:28.32 battalions or cab battalions were doing convoy security from within Kuwait and an out of Iraq
01:08:28.32 --> 01:08:35.68 um my platoon was attached to field artillery battalion and we were we it I and I I'm so
01:08:35.68 --> 01:08:40.96 grateful for this but we were we were physically located very very far away from the flagpole
01:08:41.68 --> 01:08:47.52 and then the big bases that that exist in Kuwait so we were within an active Kuwait-y naval base
01:08:48.48 --> 01:08:52.96 and right on the water which you know it's my gig I gotta be close to the water if I can
01:08:52.96 --> 01:09:01.04 um but our our main mission the artillery battalion had kind of a forced protection mission
01:09:02.40 --> 01:09:12.56 but my platoon uh we had had two things one was kind of security like like high level
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:16.72 security if we had VIPs coming into Kuwait or and we worked with the embassy a lot we did a lot of
01:09:16.72 --> 01:09:24.16 stuff in and around the embassy so like PSD like personal security you know we did security for a lot
01:09:24.16 --> 01:09:31.12 of the ammunition movements from the ports to where they had to go and then also um we did
01:09:31.12 --> 01:09:34.88 I had a training mission which was the which was the the fun one for me it was being able to go
01:09:34.88 --> 01:09:42.96 and train the the Kuwaiti army on you know marksmanship um basic you know how to clear building
01:09:42.96 --> 01:09:47.12 uh what do you do if you're dealing with like a civil disturbance or a riot
01:09:47.68 --> 01:09:49.12 right control
01:09:51.12 --> 01:10:00.56 it was it was it was it was it was interesting for me though because um you know I
01:10:01.12 --> 01:10:07.36 platoon leader for an military police platoon in Kuwait where
01:10:07.36 --> 01:10:14.88 I didn't realize until we got there they don't allow women on their bases at all it doesn't matter
01:10:14.88 --> 01:10:19.60 if you're the general's wife or you're a janitor there are no women what if you told
01:10:19.60 --> 01:10:25.84 you gathered told see gathered showed up and I really didn't know when we rolled up
01:10:25.84 --> 01:10:31.20 like that first day to go in and meet the unit and meet the unit commander obviously I'm in uniform
01:10:31.20 --> 01:10:35.84 and my hair is up I got you know ball of hair on the back of my head and I didn't know what they
01:10:35.84 --> 01:10:42.88 were gonna do at the gate did you have other females in your platoon I had I had uh two
01:10:42.88 --> 01:10:46.96 two females in my platoon there uh one was the knee three one was the knee four
01:10:48.40 --> 01:10:53.04 the rest were you know these are guys who are working state local or federal law enforcement
01:10:53.04 --> 01:10:58.88 mostly at home in their civilian jobs and just about all of them had at least one or two deployments
01:10:58.88 --> 01:11:05.52 under their belt and so there there's seasoned experienced guys but yeah so I showed up I showed
01:11:05.52 --> 01:11:10.16 up on day one and you know kind of showed my decar to the gate and the gate guard was didn't
01:11:10.16 --> 01:11:16.96 really know what to do but he saw you know he saw the American flag and he was like oh okay
01:11:18.16 --> 01:11:23.12 go ahead and and so my I was my partner and this was a master sergeant at E8
01:11:23.84 --> 01:11:31.44 and super super cool he's going guy and and so we went and we started to we got introduced to the
01:11:31.44 --> 01:11:36.16 guys that we'd be training we ended up doing a number of iterations of different groups of guys
01:11:36.16 --> 01:11:44.40 but you know kind of went down the line shaken hands and saying hello and uh there was probably
01:11:44.40 --> 01:11:51.60 half of the co-edey guys who I was invisible there certainly was no shaking up hands certainly
01:11:51.60 --> 01:12:00.08 no eye contact or even acknowledgement that I was standing there and you know okay got it challenge
01:12:00.08 --> 01:12:06.48 how do you go from like I don't exist in your universe to actually being able to help provide you
01:12:06.48 --> 01:12:14.000 with some instruction and and develop the report necessary to be able to do that and you know so I
01:12:15.20 --> 01:12:22.56 I kind of drawing from maybe the Aloha and Hawaii of just recognizing hey you know we're
01:12:22.56 --> 01:12:27.44 we're different people different backgrounds different language different culture different everything
01:12:27.44 --> 01:12:36.96 but I respect like I respect you and I'm gonna treat you with that Aloha that respect
01:12:37.68 --> 01:12:44.64 and gradually I started to see the ice kind of started to fall and ultimately you know
01:12:44.64 --> 01:12:48.48 when we're out of the range and I'm walking up and I'm telling them like hey like okay here's this
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:54.08 like basic safety things and and then like okay I'm gonna show you how to do it and then you know
01:12:54.08 --> 01:13:00.80 gradually I got to the point and I knew I knew I had made progress we sat down for lunch
01:13:00.80 --> 01:13:07.04 and they started to share their lunch with me is all like food food as food is the ultimate you know
01:13:07.04 --> 01:13:11.68 bridge builder and I knew once you were like hey like yeah here try my food like oh yeah
01:13:11.68 --> 01:13:16.16 oh awesome like cool yeah that's really good and it got to the point where
01:13:17.92 --> 01:13:22.08 on on their graduation day of that first group their commander
01:13:22.08 --> 01:13:25.76 had everybody in the room everybody who's seated there again and they're getting all the
01:13:25.76 --> 01:13:32.000 graduations certificates and everything and their commander asked me to come forward and presented
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:39.68 me with this plaque of appreciation and thanks and some of there was some Americans civilians who
01:13:39.68 --> 01:13:44.80 were also working that mission and they had been there longer than we had and they said
01:13:44.80 --> 01:13:48.96 it's all after were there like Tulsa I hope you understand what a big deal that was for
01:13:48.96 --> 01:14:00.24 this co-edimentary officer you know the traditional bearded Muslim man to recognize the accomplishments
01:14:00.24 --> 01:14:09.92 of a woman and I was very grateful to have been able to experience
01:14:10.96 --> 01:14:16.80 experience that and recognizing the bigger significance that you know not so much about like
01:14:16.80 --> 01:14:22.32 well this is about women's rights or empowerment but more so about how to overcome seemingly
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.08 impossible barriers to get to a place where you have mutual professional respect and understanding
01:14:33.36 --> 01:14:39.68 and and the power of that alone and there are obvious parallels that we could point to in today's
01:14:39.68 --> 01:14:44.88 world here in America but yeah yeah that's that's an awesome story and
01:14:44.88 --> 01:14:49.92 lately I've been talking a lot about the fact that if you want respect you got to give
01:14:49.92 --> 01:14:54.32 respect if you want people to listen to you you got to listen to them if you want to have
01:14:54.32 --> 01:14:58.72 influence over people you've got to allow them to influence you and if you want to build trust
01:14:58.72 --> 01:15:04.72 with people you've got to trust them yes and it's interesting you know you kind of captured
01:15:05.36 --> 01:15:11.12 well at least for sure the respect part is Aloha right it's the Aloha spirit of hey you know
01:15:11.12 --> 01:15:15.04 what you're a little bit different than me but it's all good we'll figure it out and that way
01:15:15.04 --> 01:15:22.56 of building relationships is so much better than you saying hey look I might be a woman you
01:15:22.56 --> 01:15:27.20 might not think I'm here but I am a exactly 10 and he United States Army and you will like
01:15:27.20 --> 01:15:32.40 okay good luck with that you never would have made any progress at all none and and so
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:38.88 taking a little a little bit of Aloha apparently with a little lunch as well goes a long way over time
01:15:38.88 --> 01:15:45.76 and and and people want to be confrontational because it seems like well it's the least
01:15:45.76 --> 01:15:49.60 offensive thing to your ego right when when someone looks at you what doesn't look at you treat
01:15:49.60 --> 01:15:53.68 you like you're not there that that can be a blow to your ego that your ego can't
01:15:54.40 --> 01:15:59.52 can't repress it it just has to come out your ego has to say you will look at me damn it
01:16:00.32 --> 01:16:06.000 you know I am told see listen to me you have to listen and and all those things even though it
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.68 seems like it would be you know this direct I just need to be direct with them and tell them that
01:16:11.68 --> 01:16:16.16 I and it's like okay I'm telling you that that attitude doesn't work and look we're talking
01:16:16.16 --> 01:16:20.88 about a pretty serious cultural divide yeah but it happens with everything it happens if you and I
01:16:20.88 --> 01:16:24.80 are trying to figure out how to execute a mission and you think we should do one way and I think we should
01:16:24.80 --> 01:16:28.000 do a different way and I tell you well to tell you that's because you don't you haven't done this
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.08 kind of operation before or because you you haven't been in as long as me or because you don't you you
01:16:32.08 --> 01:16:36.56 went to OCS and I went to West Point so therefore I know but all those things are wrong all those
01:16:36.56 --> 01:16:42.32 things are going to make it harder for us to come to a good an actual good the best possible decision
01:16:42.32 --> 01:16:48.96 which is what we want so put your ego in check add a little a low-hot of that and and we can
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:52.40 actually make some progress and and unfortunately you know it's kind of like what I started off talking
01:16:52.40 --> 01:16:59.92 about you know if you have an idea about something I've an idea about something and my my default mode
01:16:59.92 --> 01:17:06.24 is to say you're freaking wrong how are we gonna how are we gonna talk about it how are we gonna
01:17:06.24 --> 01:17:11.60 actually figure out what to do no you stay on your side and all stay on my side and we won't do anything
01:17:12.16 --> 01:17:18.72 which is a freaking nightmare yeah and that's where that's where I see the parallel and that
01:17:18.72 --> 01:17:25.84 experience with the Aloha that that I strived to bring every day to my work in Washington is you
01:17:25.84 --> 01:17:32.32 start with you know finding that common ground even with such incredible start differences that
01:17:32.32 --> 01:17:38.08 that are real you start with okay what what is what is the common ground that we can stand on
01:17:38.08 --> 01:17:45.52 comfortably together coupled with what is our shared objective what is the thing that we are
01:17:45.52 --> 01:17:50.80 trying to accomplish and recognizing that whatever your personal feelings may be however strong
01:17:50.80 --> 01:17:57.68 they may maybe what your views are ultimately if you can find some commonality in both those places
01:17:58.56 --> 01:18:06.08 then you recognize that it's not about you it's about this shared goal and purpose that you have
01:18:06.08 --> 01:18:11.52 and then like you'll find a way you'll figure it out that again this is another thing I've been talking
01:18:11.52 --> 01:18:18.000 a lot about lately is if you and I can get aligned we we can come to a solution but we sometimes
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.60 have to go pretty high up the ladder of alignment to get to a point where it actually meets so we have
01:18:23.60 --> 01:18:27.60 a mission and you want to attack the target from the left and I want to attack the target from the right
01:18:28.32 --> 01:18:34.24 well that's that's okay as long as we both know that we want to secure that target that's what we want to
01:18:34.24 --> 01:18:39.20 do and then all one of us has to do is put our ego in check for 15 seconds and say you know what
01:18:39.20 --> 01:18:43.68 tell us a attacking from the right sounds good let's do it your way right and because I just want to get to
01:18:43.68 --> 01:18:48.64 I just want to get the target secured that's what I want to do that's that's okay
01:18:49.68 --> 01:18:53.04 where we also get into a problem is a gender now you have an agenda where you want your
01:18:53.04 --> 01:18:57.68 opportunity to do it and I want my opportunity to do it so then we have to rise above those
01:18:57.68 --> 01:19:02.72 agendas now it's possible that our agendas that your agenda still aligned with the goal you want to
01:19:02.72 --> 01:19:05.84 get the target to get great you want your opportunity to do it you know what if I can put my ego
01:19:05.84 --> 01:19:09.20 and check for 15 seconds and say you know what sounds good tell us you want you to take your
01:19:09.20 --> 01:19:14.08 puttune can take lead and all support you right sounds good all I want to do is get the mission done
01:19:14.08 --> 01:19:20.24 exactly and people run around in circles and attack each other and worst part they never make progress
01:19:20.24 --> 01:19:25.04 they never make it to the target because they can't even they can't even come to any kind of agreement
01:19:25.04 --> 01:19:31.04 yeah that that that that sounds exactly like one of the first things I was introduced to as a new
01:19:31.04 --> 01:19:37.12 member of Congress where I the the message was delivered very clearly from the leadership
01:19:37.12 --> 01:19:42.16 within the within the democratic party and so my Republicans went through some of the same
01:19:42.16 --> 01:19:47.04 stuff on their side so this isn't about one party or another but the message being like hey look
01:19:47.04 --> 01:19:52.16 this is about winning the election and if we're in power it's about keeping power if we are
01:19:52.16 --> 01:19:57.20 not in power it's about how how do we get it back and so if there's a bill for example
01:19:58.72 --> 01:20:04.32 that deals with whatever let's say it deals with transportation something about as universally
01:20:04.32 --> 01:20:10.000 agreed upon as you can get like we need to move from a to be all of us do so there's a bill on
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.08 transportation infrastructure and it's introduced by a Republican don't support that bill you should
01:20:18.08 --> 01:20:23.84 support one that could be virtually identical as long as there's a Democrat name at the top
01:20:23.84 --> 01:20:29.60 that's leading that effort because that will allow the Democrat person and the Democratic party
01:20:29.60 --> 01:20:35.44 to then take credit for it which will then be put on a brochure or a TV ad that you can use in
01:20:35.44 --> 01:20:43.68 the next campaign which will get us closer to getting power or or maintaining power and this is
01:20:43.68 --> 01:20:50.16 where we want running to problems in the world yeah is when ultimately we're not aligned
01:20:51.28 --> 01:20:56.96 that that's where the actual problem comes in is if you where you want to go the target that you want
01:20:56.96 --> 01:21:02.96 to hit is not the same as the target that I want to hit and then we can't we can't overcome these
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:08.32 problems because we are not going to the same place they don't they're not the same place so how
01:21:08.32 --> 01:21:12.72 we're gonna go we can't be two places of once we're gonna your place or my place and that's where
01:21:12.72 --> 01:21:18.56 we run into a problem when people are saying well the main point of us doing this is to get power
01:21:18.56 --> 01:21:24.000 not to help American people not to move transportation in a good direction but just so we get
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.88 reelected and if that's what the goal is we can't get aligned and it's a problem and that is exactly
01:21:28.88 --> 01:21:34.80 where the lack of alignment exists because you have a political infrastructure where both political
01:21:34.80 --> 01:21:39.68 parties are ultimately and this is not every single person but if you look at the goals of the
01:21:39.68 --> 01:21:45.60 leadership of both parties it is about power so right you know I served in Congress for eight years
01:21:46.64 --> 01:21:52.72 for the first half of my time their Republicans were in charge Democrats were in minority
01:21:52.72 --> 01:21:57.52 and then Democrats won and took over the House Democrats are in charge of Republicans in my
01:21:57.52 --> 01:22:02.88 naughty and you just see it play out where whoever's in power is trying to keep power whoever's not
01:22:02.88 --> 01:22:08.56 is trying to is trying to take it and there's no alignment because they're looking out for their own
01:22:08.56 --> 01:22:14.96 interests for the parties and they are not ultimately making decisions about what legislation
01:22:14.96 --> 01:22:20.24 comes to the House floor or what issues are being tackled based on what's in the best interest of
01:22:20.24 --> 01:22:29.52 the country which is where that alignment must be and it's how our system of governance was set up
01:22:29.52 --> 01:22:35.12 that not that you have everybody is part of one party or marching in lockstep or having all of the
01:22:35.12 --> 01:22:42.16 same views but instead that you bring the diversity of different views experiences and backgrounds
01:22:42.16 --> 01:22:48.88 and ideas by having in the House of Representatives 435 people from all across the country all
01:22:48.88 --> 01:22:54.24 elected by constituents in their districts who can then bring their ideas where you have debate
01:22:54.24 --> 01:22:58.88 and conversation you have bills that that theoretically go through committee where you can offer
01:22:58.88 --> 01:23:05.36 amendments and try to strengthen whatever the proposal might be or kill it if it's a bad idea
01:23:05.36 --> 01:23:09.92 and then you've got a vote on the floor like this is civics 101 that we learn about in school
01:23:10.96 --> 01:23:17.20 it does not exist in reality though today because instead of figuring out hey how do we
01:23:17.20 --> 01:23:22.64 work out our differences and come to that same goal of like how do we fix all of the pot holes in
01:23:22.64 --> 01:23:28.16 our roads in Hawaii and all over the country okay we need to invest in some infrastructure how
01:23:28.16 --> 01:23:32.96 do we do that how much money how is this best going to be executed instead and we saw this
01:23:32.96 --> 01:23:38.24 play out over you know I'm when Trump first got elected I reporters asked me what what do you
01:23:38.24 --> 01:23:44.08 think tell see is the one thing like what's the low hanging fruit where they're we're bipartisan
01:23:44.08 --> 01:23:52.16 agreement and work is possible I and most other people said infrastructure every community needs it
01:23:52.96 --> 01:23:59.04 every this is a domestic job creator that actually solves real problems that need to be solved
01:23:59.76 --> 01:24:04.96 it never happened there was no infrastructure bill that even really came before Congress for any
01:24:04.96 --> 01:24:10.88 serious consideration and why is that like the most low-hanging fruit that everybody agrees on that
01:24:10.88 --> 01:24:18.40 objective didn't happen because of partisan differences and an unwillingness to say okay yeah Democrats
01:24:18.40 --> 01:24:21.60 had a certain idea and a certain dollar amount Republicans had a different idea and a different
01:24:21.60 --> 01:24:27.60 dollar amount but there was never any real good faith serious effort to say okay where can we meet
01:24:27.60 --> 01:24:31.92 in the middle what am I willing to give up what are you willing to give up so that we can actually
01:24:31.92 --> 01:24:38.08 start to deliver on fulfilling the needs the very real needs that exist within our communities
01:24:38.08 --> 01:24:44.80 so I know you said not everyone is so entrenched but what percentage of people are entrenched
01:24:44.80 --> 01:24:49.44 on the left and the right I would say most I would say most and and not because they're
01:24:50.40 --> 01:24:59.04 bad people necessarily but if you look at the system that exists the power that the political
01:24:59.04 --> 01:25:11.52 parties have is massive and unfortunately there are two few people who go to Washington willing to
01:25:13.20 --> 01:25:19.76 buck that power and deal with the consequences of that and the consequences being hey if you don't
01:25:19.76 --> 01:25:24.72 if you don't tow the party line then if you've got a tough challenge in your election campaign
01:25:24.72 --> 01:25:30.32 we're not going to help fund TV ads for you for example or we're not going to play resources to
01:25:30.32 --> 01:25:37.36 support you or we'll pull you off the committee that that you're on that you really like or maybe
01:25:37.36 --> 01:25:42.000 we're not going to consider your bill on you we won't allow your bill to come to the floor for a
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.60 vote and sometimes these are very direct statements that are made and sometimes they're they're
01:25:46.16 --> 01:25:53.36 signals that are sent in an indirect way and so the results of having two few people who are
01:25:53.36 --> 01:26:00.64 willing to kind of stand up and and make decisions based on purely based on on merit versus
01:26:01.36 --> 01:26:11.44 the political pressures is you end up having a lot of people who either enjoy and get right into
01:26:11.44 --> 01:26:19.52 playing the political games and are all about it and then you have other people who maybe unwillingly
01:26:19.52 --> 01:26:24.56 or are even as they are disheartened but feel like they have no other option than to play the game
01:26:25.76 --> 01:26:32.72 and so it you know and and frankly it's because they see I see people like me you know
01:26:32.72 --> 01:26:38.08 President Obama was president during you know two thai came I was sworn into Congress in 2013
01:26:38.08 --> 01:26:42.64 so his first four years and then I had President Trump as president for the last four years
01:26:42.64 --> 01:26:48.08 that I was in Congress and in both cases you know if there was an issue that I agreed on
01:26:48.08 --> 01:26:52.000 there's a bomber a Trump I spoke out and said it if there's an issue I disagree on
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:59.44 Obama a Trump I spoke out and said it which is which is is is kind of heresy in Washington
01:26:59.44 --> 01:27:05.68 because the expectation is even if it's the same exact scenario the same exact situation
01:27:05.68 --> 01:27:12.16 if it's your person in the White House and you don't like it you don't say anything but if it's
01:27:12.16 --> 01:27:17.52 the other party then I mean the world is going to end look at how this terrible thing and it's such
01:27:17.52 --> 01:27:22.88 blatant double standard and so hypocritical I think this is one of the reason why voters are just
01:27:22.88 --> 01:27:31.60 like come on like we can see what you're doing so ridiculous exactly but you know they exist within
01:27:31.60 --> 01:27:37.76 this bubble where the it's I mean it is it's I've talked about this before is it's kind of like
01:27:37.76 --> 01:27:44.56 high school there is a popularity contest and it's both people it it's this ecosystem where people
01:27:44.56 --> 01:27:51.68 really care a whole lot about what parties they're invited to or who answers their phone calls
01:27:52.88 --> 01:27:56.000 it's not you're just going to point this out because I've heard you talk about this before
01:27:56.56 --> 01:28:01.92 you're not saying like oh it's like high school where people care about what parties they're
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:08.16 invited to you're saying people actually are thinking well Tulsi didn't like me to that party so
01:28:08.16 --> 01:28:13.36 we're going to step on her bill that she put for all give you an example very it is it is literal
01:28:13.36 --> 01:28:19.76 it's not like you know it's not an analogy it's literal there there was you know in the pre-COVID
01:28:19.76 --> 01:28:25.92 world and maybe even in the pre-Trump world the White House correspondence dinner is like
01:28:25.92 --> 01:28:35.60 the big event of the year and it is hosted by the media for the media and you only get invited
01:28:35.60 --> 01:28:41.20 as a politician if someone in the media invites you to go as as your guest it's kind of like
01:28:41.20 --> 01:28:49.44 Washington DC's Oscars kind of gala type situation so you know it's all of the fancies
01:28:49.44 --> 01:28:55.20 everything and Hollywood celebrities fly in for it and it's like a it's a really big thing
01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.40 and I remember you know I I happened to get an invitation to go the first year I was there
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:06.24 without knowing anything about what it was and I was talking to some of my colleagues are like
01:29:06.24 --> 01:29:12.80 Tulsi you got in it like I've like this guy my friend he's like I've been here seven years
01:29:12.80 --> 01:29:19.92 and I've never been invited to that like Hoka Brother up and it was so I mean it was so surreal to
01:29:19.92 --> 01:29:24.72 me especially because having gone from that where I was invited to go to that or other things you know
01:29:24.72 --> 01:29:32.08 like the first few years I was there and then you know I stopped getting those invitations
01:29:32.08 --> 01:29:39.36 because like hold on a second she's actually like challenging whatever the narrative is
01:29:39.36 --> 01:29:44.40 or challenging decisions made within her own party or saying or doing things that didn't
01:29:44.40 --> 01:29:51.52 fall within the mainstream of popularity in Washington DC and so I've experienced the arc
01:29:51.52 --> 01:29:56.40 of like okay you're cool you seem kind of cool and like you know you're a surfer you're better
01:29:56.40 --> 01:30:00.88 in your this or that and then all of a sudden like oh wait hold on you actually have something to say
01:30:00.88 --> 01:30:08.08 that's not just whatever literally the email talking points are of the day then you know
01:30:09.20 --> 01:30:16.16 it turns into something else let's let's rewind it a little bit to when you actually ran
01:30:16.72 --> 01:30:26.64 so you get home from in in what 2009 you get home 2009 I came back from my second deployment in 2009
01:30:26.64 --> 01:30:35.68 and kind of faced a similar pivotal decision point on what to do next and just like the first
01:30:35.68 --> 01:30:39.76 deployment I came back with the same kind of sense of purpose and mission of wanting to
01:30:40.48 --> 01:30:46.56 find a way to be in a position where I could I could help influence decisions or make decisions
01:30:46.56 --> 01:30:54.72 about our countries foreign policy and about our military and but didn't know exactly what or
01:30:54.72 --> 01:31:00.80 how I would do that didn't there was no obvious choice at that time I had applied for something
01:31:00.80 --> 01:31:06.16 called the White House Fellows program which I thought would have been a great opportunity where
01:31:06.16 --> 01:31:10.64 basically it's it's a highly competitive you heard of it before yeah so it's it's this highly
01:31:10.64 --> 01:31:18.40 competitive program that ultimately if selected you serve for a year as a senior special assistant
01:31:18.40 --> 01:31:24.56 to a cabinet member or to the president or the vice president so you kind of you know jump in
01:31:24.56 --> 01:31:32.16 your way up to directly being able to help influence and impact issues so I had applied for that
01:31:32.16 --> 01:31:38.24 got through to the regional finals and then got through to the final final interviews which was
01:31:38.96 --> 01:31:46.48 I think three days of assessment essentially which consisted of you know we're told okay
01:31:46.48 --> 01:31:50.64 as soon as literally as soon as you arrive there you're being assessed by the judges I think there
01:31:50.64 --> 01:31:55.28 were 12 judges and ultimately they would choose probably 12 people out of maybe I think maybe
01:31:55.28 --> 01:32:04.48 they're 20 of us there and so whether it was the the welcoming reception or these actual
01:32:04.48 --> 01:32:09.04 boards essentially that that you would go individually and sit before there's you know I think
01:32:09.04 --> 01:32:16.80 four different boards of three judges and you know do a Q&A kind of thing and then there was
01:32:16.80 --> 01:32:22.88 something that they gave us an exercise where all of us who were there we had to pull names
01:32:22.88 --> 01:32:28.40 or positions out of a hat and so I think the position I got was White House Chief of Staff
01:32:28.40 --> 01:32:32.24 someone else was the president someone else was the vice president and then they say okay here's the
01:32:32.24 --> 01:32:41.04 scenario I remember was I could say like country X is just launched an attack on us and you have
01:32:42.16 --> 01:32:49.04 you've convened a meeting in the situation room execute like you've got 15 minutes to prepare
01:32:49.04 --> 01:32:55.52 and then you go and execute and so role playing scenario kind of war gaming thing and and the
01:32:55.52 --> 01:32:59.36 judges are just standing there watching and just trying to figure out okay what are the dynamics and
01:32:59.36 --> 01:33:03.28 you know who were the alphas and who's taking charge and who's just like the wall flower sitting
01:33:03.28 --> 01:33:06.48 on the edge and how do you make decisions that process that kind of stuff it was it was a really
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:12.64 cool experience long story short I didn't get picked what I don't think you got picked
01:33:14.64 --> 01:33:19.68 I don't know I really don't know I I sought out a couple of the judges that I had
01:33:20.24 --> 01:33:24.56 developed a little bit of a rapport with to kind of get some feedback and and this was part of the
01:33:24.56 --> 01:33:28.80 thing like every step of the way people who were former White House fellows who had given me
01:33:28.80 --> 01:33:33.84 some mentorship on how to approach the process in advance and and some of the judges like
01:33:34.88 --> 01:33:39.76 they're like off your shoe it like you were exactly the kind of person that this program was built for
01:33:40.64 --> 01:33:49.92 and and so I stupidly had started to believe all of that and you know went through it
01:33:49.92 --> 01:33:55.52 and was careful and did my preparation and went into it but you know in my mind I had already told
01:33:55.52 --> 01:34:04.16 myself like you got this like you're in and then so when I was I was writing the Metro and DC
01:34:04.16 --> 01:34:09.04 and I remember getting off at Union Station and coming up the escalator and then my phone buzzed
01:34:09.04 --> 01:34:16.64 with a voicemail of course I was waiting for the call and the voicemail said hi Tulsi we
01:34:16.64 --> 01:34:25.44 were Grett to inform you so for that moment I was just like I was I was incredibly disappointed
01:34:25.44 --> 01:34:33.84 obviously but then had to reset be like okay so like that's off the table and so I ended up I ended up
01:34:34.64 --> 01:34:39.20 you know I knew that I was continuing to see what what can I do and I ended up running for
01:34:39.20 --> 01:34:46.40 I'd getting elected to the Honolulu City Council and focusing on those pot holes and you know
01:34:46.40 --> 01:34:54.32 trash and sewers and parks and and law enforcement for two years until my former boss Senator
01:34:54.32 --> 01:35:01.60 Akaka retired from the US Senator announced he was retiring and the one of the members of Congress
01:35:02.16 --> 01:35:07.76 said that she was going to run for his seat which left the vacancy in the house and ultimately
01:35:07.76 --> 01:35:14.000 that's that's where I made the decision I made the decision to run knowing that specifically
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.48 in the United States Congress I would be exactly where I needed to be to try to influence and impact
01:35:20.48 --> 01:35:25.84 those decisions was it a tough campaign I mean it's incredibly tough who are you going against
01:35:26.56 --> 01:35:32.56 there were six people who ran you know it's strong democratic state so the the real election is the
01:35:32.56 --> 01:35:39.84 primary election and there were six people who were running in that democratic primary but the main
01:35:39.84 --> 01:35:48.96 person who was kind of the assumed winner of the election even you know nine months out from the
01:35:48.96 --> 01:35:56.64 election was a guy who had just run for and lost a race for governor but who was also the former
01:35:56.64 --> 01:36:03.12 mayor of of the city and county of Honolulu and so you know just for some perspective our state
01:36:03.12 --> 01:36:13.52 has about 1.4 million population around 980,000 of which live on a wall and the district that
01:36:13.52 --> 01:36:18.80 we were running for there's there's two members of Congress from Hawaii one is kind of the urban
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:24.48 representative that that has almost the whole South Shore of Oahu the urban that kind of density urban
01:36:24.48 --> 01:36:29.20 populated area and then the other member of Congress which was the seat that I was running for has
01:36:30.32 --> 01:36:36.32 the west side nor shore and east side of Oahu and all of the neighbor islands and so I came into this
01:36:36.32 --> 01:36:46.48 with I think it was about 2% known name recognition in that district because my city council
01:36:46.48 --> 01:36:52.88 district was actually in the other it was in the urban part of Oahu so there was again no overlap
01:36:52.88 --> 01:36:57.92 in those districts and the guy the another front runner in the race he had everybody in the state
01:36:57.92 --> 01:37:04.72 knew who he was he also had a little bit of baggage that came with having just been the mayor and
01:37:04.72 --> 01:37:13.12 that's a whole other whole other conversation but so so the challenge was was pretty great to go
01:37:13.12 --> 01:37:20.88 from like 3% against 100% and somehow I had to try to cover that gap and I just you know I remember
01:37:20.88 --> 01:37:29.36 meeting with with some of the political you know elders for lack of a better word in Hawaii
01:37:29.36 --> 01:37:34.24 and letting them know that people I had decent relationships with letting him know that I was
01:37:34.24 --> 01:37:40.80 gonna run and and why and getting a lot of patronizing responses back saying you know tell see
01:37:40.80 --> 01:37:48.16 you're I think I was 30 at the time 31 here young you have no chance against this guy
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:54.88 so just you know don't waste your time and come back and try again in like 20 years you'll be great
01:37:54.88 --> 01:38:02.88 in 20 years and that I was like I don't operate on that timeline so you're like hold my
01:38:02.88 --> 01:38:09.36 beer pretty much pretty much did you just go super aggressive how did how the hell did you make
01:38:09.36 --> 01:38:16.64 up that kind of distance well so first I I'd had to fundraising as a huge thing because I needed
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:23.28 to be able to have the resources to let people know I existed and who I am first of all just my name
01:38:23.28 --> 01:38:30.08 period and then to let them know you know my experience in my background and why why I was wanting
01:38:30.08 --> 01:38:36.72 to serve them in Congress and so you know we started out we started out just like putting signs up
01:38:36.72 --> 01:38:43.44 around the district and hoping that that would cause for people to say who's Tulsi Gabbard
01:38:43.44 --> 01:38:51.44 like what what is this about and and and it was it was a lot of time going and doing what what I
01:38:52.56 --> 01:38:58.96 called the most extensive job interview ever where I went and traveled to each island and spent
01:38:58.96 --> 01:39:05.04 a lot of time in communities with individuals with groups small groups large groups introducing
01:39:05.04 --> 01:39:10.88 myself to them and answering their questions and letting them know why I wanted to serve them
01:39:11.44 --> 01:39:15.68 in Congress what kind of leadership I would bring where I stood on on different issues that they
01:39:15.68 --> 01:39:26.48 cared about and ultimately what happened was five months before election day my I was pulling
01:39:26.48 --> 01:39:33.76 at 20% to the front runners 65 and then the rest was split between the other people and I have
01:39:33.76 --> 01:39:44.40 like awesome progress for 20 years exactly exactly and I just I just continued you know I was
01:39:44.40 --> 01:39:48.88 I was on the phone and I was asking people for support and raising money and then also out on the
01:39:48.88 --> 01:39:55.28 road just you know seven days a week all day and it was it was it was it was an incredible incredible
01:39:55.28 --> 01:40:05.76 experience election day comes around in August of 2012 and all the way up until about two weeks
01:40:05.76 --> 01:40:12.000 before the election the local media and even some of the national coverage was just like this
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.48 guys this guy's got it I had heard from other people he was already interviewing staff a few months
01:40:18.48 --> 01:40:27.44 before the election that he planned to hire once he won our debate we had one big
01:40:27.44 --> 01:40:32.88 televised debate we had a few others but there was one big televised debate I passed him in the
01:40:32.88 --> 01:40:42.88 hall right before the debate and he was singing that song black eyed peas I think tonight's gonna be
01:40:42.88 --> 01:40:51.68 a good night as he looked back at me and and I will I will I have been told I killed it in the
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:58.72 debate and that was where a lot of people first started to take notice like who is she and I think
01:40:58.72 --> 01:41:04.56 I think it may may have caught him by surprise just a little bit but still like all the way up
01:41:04.56 --> 01:41:09.36 until about two weeks before it was like he's got it and then some of the polls started to shift
01:41:09.36 --> 01:41:14.40 and some of the local news they were like wait I had this can't be right these polls can't be right
01:41:14.40 --> 01:41:20.40 because you can't see a big turnaround I ended up winning the primary election going from that 20%
01:41:22.08 --> 01:41:30.32 five months before to actually beating him by a 22% margin on election day and it was it was
01:41:30.32 --> 01:41:41.84 people to be good yeah people in DC like the next day they're like okay like what scandal caused
01:41:41.84 --> 01:41:48.64 him to to allowed you to win essentially or what was the thing that you know that happened and it was
01:41:48.64 --> 01:41:56.48 it was there was none it was literally I think the difference between someone who felt they were
01:41:56.48 --> 01:42:04.72 entitled to the position because of a number of reasons and and me recognizing what the position
01:42:04.72 --> 01:42:12.88 really is it's a position of trust and responsibility that is granted to you by the voters
01:42:12.88 --> 01:42:21.68 in the state and they are the ones who I'm accountable to and who I work for and it was just it was it was
01:42:21.68 --> 01:42:28.96 the our local kind of Walter Cronkite anchor of our new station who's been doing it for ever
01:42:28.96 --> 01:42:34.16 longer than I probably for about 30 or 40 years he's still on TV now he's a Vietnam veteran
01:42:35.52 --> 01:42:41.12 and that election night he was reporting the results and he actually started to get choked up
01:42:41.12 --> 01:42:50.16 and and got a little got a little tearful because he understood why I was running bringing that
01:42:50.16 --> 01:42:56.08 experience of service and and having been deployed and the significance of
01:43:00.24 --> 01:43:06.40 that I was going to Congress not for myself but that I was bringing my brothers and sisters in
01:43:06.40 --> 01:43:13.92 uniform with me and and it was it was a heavy night I mean it was you know there
01:43:13.92 --> 01:43:19.92 are parties and things going on but I remember leaving the the hall that night on election night
01:43:20.88 --> 01:43:26.32 and my sister was walking out with me and she's like Tulsi you know you're allowed to celebrate
01:43:26.32 --> 01:43:32.24 you know you're allowed to be happy about this but I was just I was immediately like okay
01:43:32.24 --> 01:43:37.12 all right these are the results what are we waking up and doing tomorrow what what's the next task
01:43:37.12 --> 01:43:42.16 what do we have to do now in order to make sure that we we hit our next Martin and that's
01:43:42.16 --> 01:43:50.000 um and and that's kind of the the focus that I that I carried with me throughout is you know
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:57.36 I'm not entitled to anything and I am here only because the people and in my community and my home
01:43:57.36 --> 01:44:05.44 state have trusted me to to work for them and to to be their voice and and to represent them
01:44:05.44 --> 01:44:11.76 to the best of my ability so the the hype of you winning that and come being the being the underdog
01:44:11.76 --> 01:44:17.52 champ rolling in deep did that that kind of came to you to DC right I mean that that hype there's
01:44:17.52 --> 01:44:24.96 some hype train yeah so Tulsi hype train mm-hmm oh say so the Tulsi hype train shows up
01:44:25.36 --> 01:44:33.84 and your sort of um your viewed I think it's actually Nancy Pelosi's called you like rising star
01:44:33.84 --> 01:44:37.44 which is you seem to hear that okay it did not like it doesn't get thrown around that term doesn't
01:44:37.44 --> 01:44:45.04 get thrown around about political people but you were like a quote rising star in the democratic
01:44:45.04 --> 01:44:53.76 party so you came with some hype yeah I didn't I didn't fully understand why but yeah it was
01:44:53.76 --> 01:44:59.76 there I mean I had you know she I was actually making up drill time with the national guard after
01:44:59.76 --> 01:45:05.84 that primary election um I remember being at my unit and she called my my cell phone I hadn't
01:45:05.84 --> 01:45:11.68 talked to her before and she called myself on and left the message and introduced herself and just
01:45:11.68 --> 01:45:16.88 said hey you know we have a democratic convention coming up in a few weeks I would love to have you
01:45:16.88 --> 01:45:26.24 come and be one of the featured speakers during prime time as um and speak about veterans let me know
01:45:26.24 --> 01:45:34.48 if you're interested and so again like that's not an opportunity that one gets when you've just
01:45:34.48 --> 01:45:40.40 been elected to Congress to go and speak to you know 50,000 people in an arena in the whole country
01:45:40.40 --> 01:45:45.12 yeah as the whole it's everybody yeah and and so you know I mean I was
01:45:46.72 --> 01:45:53.84 grateful for the opportunity and and went and it kind of yeah and then you know shortly after
01:45:53.84 --> 01:45:58.16 getting sworn in as a member of Congress I was asked hey will you be vice chair of the DNC and
01:45:58.16 --> 01:46:04.96 I was like what what is a vice chair do um what is what is actually that you're asking me to do and
01:46:06.08 --> 01:46:13.68 what what can I do and tell you so I said they're asking you to do it's freaking weird right this is
01:46:13.68 --> 01:46:22.000 all they they kind of saw you they saw a good horse to put money into an industry to a great story
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:30.16 and they they wanted to get some control over that hype train yeah and and I think use you know
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:34.80 be able to say hey you know there there are I mean there there are biographical boxes that I
01:46:34.80 --> 01:46:42.64 checked a lot of boxes for you know the diversity uh pick the diversity higher and and you know for
01:46:42.64 --> 01:46:48.000 me I'm you know just coming in to each of these experiences completely clear eyed and not getting
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.64 googly eyed at all like oh my god they love me so much but just recognizing okay like what do
01:46:54.64 --> 01:47:00.96 what are you trying to use me for even uh what what do you get out of this and then for me thinking okay
01:47:00.96 --> 01:47:07.84 like weighing pros and cons and saying is this an opportunity that I can use to try to get some some
01:47:07.84 --> 01:47:14.80 good dawn and if it is then okay that makes sense like maybe there's a mutually beneficial thing here
01:47:14.80 --> 01:47:21.20 and if there's not then you know no thanks um but yeah that's that's that's where that's where things
01:47:21.92 --> 01:47:27.84 started so they start off like really awesome yeah hey you've got all the hype you've got opportunities
01:47:27.84 --> 01:47:35.04 they're looking at you as a as a potential kind of horse to put money into an invest into
01:47:35.84 --> 01:47:41.04 as long as we can control you on the track right that that's the fine print
01:47:41.04 --> 01:47:48.000 I what point did you did when was the first sort of time that you kind of bucked a little bit
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.12 do you remember what it was yeah absolutely it was my first year in congress in 2018
01:47:55.92 --> 01:48:02.64 every year in congress and I I don't know I think this may date back to pre air conditioning days
01:48:03.36 --> 01:48:09.20 but every year in august congress goes into recess it's the hottest year of the month it's
01:48:09.20 --> 01:48:16.88 you know DC is a literal actual like geographical swamp and so you go you go back to your
01:48:22.16 --> 01:48:25.92 you you so you go back to your district everybody in the house and the senate you there's a
01:48:25.92 --> 01:48:30.72 recess in august you go back to your district and you get like four or five weeks at home or to go and
01:48:30.72 --> 01:48:35.52 do a congressional delegation trip to another country or whatever you said that space and time to do that
01:48:35.52 --> 01:48:44.24 and so I remember being home and getting word that President Obama wanted to go and launch
01:48:45.12 --> 01:48:58.64 air strikes and a military attack in Syria and I was filling up gas in my car one I so I started
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:03.60 to get a lot of calls from constituents from people about this and this is where this is very
01:49:03.60 --> 01:49:08.08 quickly developing I don't have all the facts or information or intelligence or anything at that point
01:49:09.12 --> 01:49:16.64 but people were concerned and I was filling up I was filling up gas one day in copole and
01:49:16.64 --> 01:49:21.76 and a woman who pulled up her car next to me she saw me there and she came and walked over and she
01:49:21.76 --> 01:49:29.36 grabbed my arm she saw you can see you know my kids in the military please don't do this
01:49:29.36 --> 01:49:39.36 because I don't understand what it's for and and there was a number of other kinds of messages
01:49:39.36 --> 01:49:45.04 coming from people just either expressing total opposition or concern and just coming out of like
01:49:45.60 --> 01:49:52.32 you know Iraq and just everything that had led to that kind of cynicism and fatigue or okay
01:49:52.32 --> 01:49:56.64 we just want to go start another war in another country like what what did they do to us
01:49:56.64 --> 01:50:02.72 and so the recess time was cut short I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee at that time
01:50:03.52 --> 01:50:08.56 and I was throughout most of the time I was in Congress and so we got called back to DC early
01:50:08.56 --> 01:50:14.88 so that we could go through and get the intelligence briefings and actually get gather the information
01:50:14.88 --> 01:50:20.08 and then that was when I first started to take kind of a deep dive into what was happening in Syria
01:50:20.08 --> 01:50:29.44 and why he was proposing this and ultimately after going into the issue and the question and
01:50:29.44 --> 01:50:35.52 and really he was not going to come to Congress at first but then enough members of Congress said
01:50:35.52 --> 01:50:40.48 you can't like the Constitution does not allow you to unilaterally just start a war you have to
01:50:40.48 --> 01:50:46.64 come and get congressional approval for that and so that's what we went back and started to prepare
01:50:46.64 --> 01:50:52.000 for that vote that would happen and I just I came to the conclusion after studying the facts that
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:58.40 it would be a counterproductive military action and much of it came from I mean we had hearings
01:50:58.40 --> 01:51:04.56 with Secretary then Secretary of State Kerry and others at the time who we're trying to tell Congress
01:51:04.56 --> 01:51:12.000 like well you know this is not going to be a pin prick strike but it's not going to be a decapitation
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:18.48 it's going to be a punch in the gut and you know some of my follow-up questions were like okay
01:51:18.48 --> 01:51:26.72 so you're going to go and deliver a punch in the gut attack how will they respond oh you know
01:51:26.72 --> 01:51:31.28 we don't really know but we don't think it'll be a big deal okay who are their friends
01:51:32.32 --> 01:51:40.16 who are they going to call for help and how may they respond how could this potentially escalate
01:51:40.16 --> 01:51:46.40 into something that is no longer a punch in the gut but something that first second third fourth
01:51:46.40 --> 01:51:51.84 order of effects their response will require response for a must which require response and all of you
01:51:51.84 --> 01:51:57.28 know that the the the tit for tat that then begins once you go over and say I'm not going to cut
01:51:57.28 --> 01:52:00.72 your head off I'm just going to punch you in the gut and think that you're not going to do anything
01:52:00.72 --> 01:52:08.08 in response and I just saw so many of the similarities of a lack of foresight and
01:52:08.08 --> 01:52:15.20 strategic planning and for me again as military officer basic level like military decision making
01:52:15.20 --> 01:52:22.96 process and actually thinking through these things and I saw similarity like this could very
01:52:22.96 --> 01:52:28.16 easily become another kind of Iraq kind of situation where you start making these decisions
01:52:28.16 --> 01:52:32.56 and then they're on the fly and then you're not realizing or thinking through what do we do tomorrow
01:52:32.56 --> 01:52:43.04 and then the next day and and where do we go from here and also I wrote I wrote like an opinion piece
01:52:44.48 --> 01:52:51.44 expressing my opposition to the president president Obama's proposal published it and
01:52:53.36 --> 01:53:00.88 was the first Democrat to do so to express opposition to his proposal and very quickly got a call from the
01:53:00.88 --> 01:53:12.08 White House basically saying how dare you who in the White House it was the the first lady's
01:53:12.08 --> 01:53:20.000 chief of staff and I I still to this day scratch my head about why they asked her I knew her and maybe
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:27.36 that was just simply the reason why but I would think that on a matter like this you would want to
01:53:27.36 --> 01:53:31.92 have I don't know maybe the national security director so I'm sorry like I don't know somebody
01:53:32.96 --> 01:53:38.08 but that was that was essentially the message is how dare you not only has a Democrat but because like
01:53:38.08 --> 01:53:42.48 you're from the president's home state how could you how could you so publicly disagree with
01:53:42.48 --> 01:53:54.88 him on something but the thing was Jaco is is nowhere in that conversation was the substance
01:53:54.88 --> 01:54:02.96 of the issue raised like hey here's why we think your opposition is misplaced or here's what
01:54:02.96 --> 01:54:09.20 you're not seeing or here's what nothing yeah nothing at all you know I wrote down
01:54:10.24 --> 01:54:14.40 while you were talking what's the commander's intent like when are we trying to do here because if you
01:54:14.40 --> 01:54:19.76 can't tell me what it is what why we're going to do what we're doing then we need to talk about it more
01:54:19.76 --> 01:54:26.32 yeah that's number one and you know as you just put it the reason why why are we doing something
01:54:26.32 --> 01:54:31.12 why are we doing it and by the way I tell people all the time if you work for me and we're doing
01:54:31.12 --> 01:54:34.08 something that you don't know why we're doing it you raise your hand and you say hey Jaco why the
01:54:34.08 --> 01:54:37.44 hell are we doing this and I say well here's why and you say well that doesn't make any sense
01:54:37.44 --> 01:54:42.24 and I go please explain that to me then so that I can make a better decision because if if I can't
01:54:42.24 --> 01:54:47.76 get my team on board then I must be I must not be seeing something or I'm not explaining my perspective
01:54:47.76 --> 01:54:51.44 well enough that they can go oh yeah I got it Jaco thank you and we now understand that thank you
01:54:52.48 --> 01:55:00.56 that's number one number two so when you fire off this article is that a good tactical move for you
01:55:01.76 --> 01:55:09.20 in other words you know would it may it have been a better move to say elicin I need to talk to
01:55:09.20 --> 01:55:13.68 you know you tell your friend the the first lady's chief of staff listen I want some
01:55:13.68 --> 01:55:18.56 clarification I don't want to get crazy here but look I just got back from my rack a few years ago
01:55:18.56 --> 01:55:23.76 it gets bad it gets ugly we got to make sure we know what we're doing can we have a further
01:55:23.76 --> 01:55:28.16 conversation because no one seems to be listening to me right now and it's a problem
01:55:28.16 --> 01:55:35.76 mm-hmm I chose to take that public course of action because I had just gone through
01:55:35.76 --> 01:55:48.88 days of internal discussions Q&A expressions of concern and essentially expressed all of those
01:55:48.88 --> 01:55:56.56 same points of opposition internally to members of the administration and saw that nothing was
01:55:56.56 --> 01:56:03.12 nothing was breaking through and that the answers that they were delivering were pretty
01:56:03.12 --> 01:56:13.28 candid and set and that there was not really there there was not really an interest of a discussion
01:56:13.28 --> 01:56:18.80 or a response like of introspection saying hey maybe we're missing something here and and
01:56:18.80 --> 01:56:25.04 or maybe we're not communicating clearly or you know that it was just like this is it this is what we're
01:56:25.04 --> 01:56:30.96 doing and the why like why what what are you trying to accomplish well we need to send a message okay
01:56:30.96 --> 01:56:41.36 send a message and then what like you can like communications a two-way street I can send you a message
01:56:41.36 --> 01:56:46.16 but if if I want that message to be effective like I need to anticipate how you might respond
01:56:46.88 --> 01:56:51.92 and so there was I chose the course of action that that I chose purely because I felt I had
01:56:51.92 --> 01:57:00.24 exhausted internal or maybe kind of back channel means of addressing those concerns.
01:57:00.24 --> 01:57:07.68 Seems like what did you also sort of had already done an assessment to think like these people don't
01:57:07.68 --> 01:57:11.84 listen. Yeah. This wasn't this wasn't just a one-day you decide you know what that said I'm
01:57:11.84 --> 01:57:18.24 going to fire off the article. It's a pre-existing condition that is when people say hey I got an
01:57:18.24 --> 01:57:22.48 issue with this we get told shut up get get on board with the program that's what we're going to do so you'd
01:57:22.48 --> 01:57:29.68 already experienced that. Yeah so I mean this this it in this specific situation it was not so there
01:57:29.68 --> 01:57:34.40 were other Democrats who who shared these kinds and Republicans who shared these concerns and that
01:57:34.40 --> 01:57:41.20 it were raising these questions within the hearings both public and and closed hearings
01:57:41.20 --> 01:57:47.52 so it wasn't like hey we expect everybody to like there was not a pressure coming from the
01:57:47.52 --> 01:57:51.36 Democratic leadership in this example saying hey we expect you to tow the line on this and just
01:57:51.36 --> 01:57:57.52 support this because it's President Obama so this was not that kind of situation there are other
01:57:57.52 --> 01:58:07.60 examples of that but yeah it just it was clear it was clear that the message that was coming from
01:58:07.60 --> 01:58:14.96 the administration was was really it was kind of a one-way communication and and so I knew enough
01:58:14.96 --> 01:58:22.88 to know that when when they're they're kind of locked and loaded in in their position the only thing
01:58:22.88 --> 01:58:30.000 that may cause them to change or to budge is public pressure and that's ultimately what happened
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:38.96 it the public pressure was bipartisan and and reached such a volume that they never even brought
01:58:38.96 --> 01:58:46.32 the vote to Congress because they knew it would be an abject failure and and the the military
01:58:46.32 --> 01:58:51.12 action never happened and Obama got criticized for that because I don't know if you're
01:58:51.12 --> 01:58:56.88 remember but he this was like this is a red line right like okay and he got vastly criticized by
01:58:56.88 --> 01:59:04.24 Republicans and I think some Democrats like how how dare you not enforce your own red line and I still
01:59:04.24 --> 01:59:09.92 you know I think this was one of ultimately the final decision that he made I it was the right decision
01:59:09.92 --> 01:59:15.68 because because of all the reasons that I've held him as the wrong decision to to make in the first
01:59:15.68 --> 01:59:19.84 place but also it forced him to take a diplomatic path to resolve the issue that he was trying to
01:59:19.84 --> 01:59:26.40 address which is you know hey like maybe that should have been your first first primary course of
01:59:26.40 --> 01:59:31.04 action yeah don't paint yourself into a corner yeah exactly just like don't don't put yourself
01:59:31.04 --> 01:59:36.88 in a situation in a combat scenario where you can't maneuver don't do that don't put your you
01:59:36.88 --> 01:59:40.40 know don't don't don't put your back against a cliff where you can't go anywhere else yes don't don't
01:59:40.40 --> 01:59:43.60 don't don't do that's not a good move it's not a good tactical move it's not a good strategic move
01:59:43.60 --> 01:59:48.64 there you know this this whole thing when I when I ask you these questions one of the things that
01:59:49.60 --> 01:59:52.88 well you're gonna I know he I know you just told me you were reading about face right now well
01:59:53.44 --> 01:59:58.48 the crux of about spoiler alerter in about face hands up at the end of the Vietnam War
01:59:58.48 --> 02:00:02.32 what's not the end of the Vietnam War it's the end of his Vietnam War he goes and gets interviewed
02:00:02.32 --> 02:00:06.48 and says we're gonna lose if we don't change the way we're fighting and of course he gets drummed
02:00:06.48 --> 02:00:12.80 out of the army in a matter of months you know it's all bad and the question that I always
02:00:12.80 --> 02:00:20.48 kind of consider is well if he would have kept his mouth shut he would have had you know he would
02:00:20.48 --> 02:00:24.72 have had a brigade he would have had a division he would have had the influence of all many many
02:00:24.72 --> 02:00:30.80 more soldiers and much more strategy and and could have perhaps steered the war in a better direction
02:00:32.32 --> 02:00:38.72 if he would have played the game more now there's an emotional component to it which is completely
02:00:38.72 --> 02:00:44.000 understandable which is that hack worth absolutely love the army and he loved his soldiers and
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.80 he was seen soldiers get killed and wounded every single day and he got to a point where he was
02:00:50.80 --> 02:00:56.80 unacceptable to him we had a similar thing you know that you and I were talking about with general
02:00:56.80 --> 02:01:08.48 matters and at what point you know if general matters who's so highly respected and just smart and
02:01:11.52 --> 02:01:18.64 resolute in his beliefs and and kind of unflappable so it was really nice when he got a
02:01:18.64 --> 02:01:22.88 point it I was so happy I'm like okay we got some sanity going on here we got somebody that's that's
02:01:22.88 --> 02:01:30.64 rational right very rational guy and it's at one point it's over and then you wonder okay look I know
02:01:30.64 --> 02:01:35.36 it sucked and I know you didn't like it but don't you have more influence when you're sitting in the
02:01:35.36 --> 02:01:42.32 seat that's a that's an issue that people leaders have to deal with on all different levels you know
02:01:42.32 --> 02:01:46.000 I talk about a lot and leadership strategy and tactics not a lot but I write a section about it
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.16 if you're my boss and you tell me hey jockel I want you to do this mission here
02:01:50.16 --> 02:01:55.84 and I say well I don't think it's a good mission and I think you know it's gonna cause casualties
02:01:55.84 --> 02:02:00.64 or I don't think it's got a good strategic objective or and you say I jockel you do what I told you
02:02:00.64 --> 02:02:05.12 and I say but hey you know ma'am it doesn't seem like a good plan to me and you say hey jockel
02:02:05.12 --> 02:02:10.08 shut up and do it now I can either draw a line this hand and say I'm not going to do it and then what
02:02:10.08 --> 02:02:14.88 do you do you fire me you put echo in charge and echo goes it goes and does it because he's just a yes man
02:02:14.88 --> 02:02:22.16 so now but I've given up all my influence at that point which is not good there's a scene in band
02:02:22.16 --> 02:02:29.20 of brothers Dick Winners who gets ordered to do reconnaissance it's the end of the war and he goes
02:02:29.20 --> 02:02:35.04 I don't really think that's a good idea the Colonel says shut up and do it he goes okay he goes and does it
02:02:35.04 --> 02:02:40.80 they get a guy killed they come back the next night the the Colonel says I want you to do another
02:02:40.80 --> 02:02:44.88 Recon tomorrow night and Dick Winners says I don't think that's a good idea the war's almost over
02:02:44.88 --> 02:02:49.84 we lost a guy yesterday and he goes shut up and do it he and he says Roger that sir and they
02:02:49.84 --> 02:02:55.44 go to who a basement and they drink wine what do you see on the Recon we didn't see anything okay good
02:02:56.64 --> 02:03:02.72 you know he he went along with it but he still had some control and this is just a hard thing and
02:03:02.72 --> 02:03:08.16 it's it's interesting to hear your perspective of you know at some point you make a stand
02:03:08.16 --> 02:03:14.000 and that's where you decided to make a stand and obviously you lose some influence after you did that
02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.48 you lost some you know I don't know how many invites you got to those dinners after you did that
02:03:18.48 --> 02:03:24.96 that's probably not I know so you give up some influence but at the same time you're you're
02:03:24.96 --> 02:03:30.88 you're holding the line on what you believe in and at some point you've got to do that I mean at some
02:03:30.88 --> 02:03:35.76 point you go look told see I don't care you want me to do this mission it's a bad idea we shouldn't do it
02:03:35.76 --> 02:03:40.32 and if you got to fire me fire me yeah and maybe that's me just trying to send you a message
02:03:40.32 --> 02:03:44.64 you maybe you say or geese jocke was really serious I must really have a bad I must really have
02:03:44.64 --> 02:03:47.84 a bad perspective of what I'm trying to get this guy to do because he's never said no to me and
02:03:47.84 --> 02:03:51.76 now he's saying no to me all right jocke let's tell me your reasons again and now we can have a conversation
02:03:52.16 --> 02:04:01.12 tough tough those are tough things for leaders to do yeah and that then they're if you
02:04:01.12 --> 02:04:08.32 I would say this is especially true in politics but I think it probably applicable across the board
02:04:08.32 --> 02:04:15.84 is if you know what you are trying to accomplish ultimately what's the greater goal
02:04:17.20 --> 02:04:27.04 and your goal is not about self preservation if your goal is not selfishly motivated but instead
02:04:27.04 --> 02:04:33.36 you know how how can I serve this this greater purpose that you're obviously there to do
02:04:34.40 --> 02:04:36.80 then you're able to more
02:04:38.88 --> 02:04:44.80 unemotionally and clearly assess okay here I've got three different options here here's where this one
02:04:44.80 --> 02:04:49.52 leads here's where that one leads here's where that one leads and assess okay you know what what
02:04:50.56 --> 02:04:55.92 really ultimately what is going to help me get help get me closer to that thing that I'm trying to accomplish
02:04:55.92 --> 02:05:02.80 and yeah I've I've gone through many many iterations of this as I've made different decisions that
02:05:02.80 --> 02:05:09.84 had very serious political consequences and that especially the big ones were were very often the
02:05:09.84 --> 02:05:15.60 unpopular decision that people were kind of scratched their head like what what is wrong with her
02:05:16.32 --> 02:05:22.08 like she's she's she's going and doing things that nobody does she's going and saying things that
02:05:22.08 --> 02:05:31.52 nobody will say is she crazy or just stupid or what but if you take a step back you know really
02:05:34.08 --> 02:05:40.56 who am I accountable to and what is my purpose if my purpose is to be a part of the
02:05:43.44 --> 02:05:50.000 to seek the approval of of the elite in Washington then I would have made completely different decisions
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:58.24 completely from from the get go and I would have done very different things but if my accountability
02:05:58.24 --> 02:06:05.84 is to and it is and and has been to the people who elected me to serve if my accountability is to
02:06:05.84 --> 02:06:10.80 our brothers and sisters in uniform both of those who continue to serve those who've laid down
02:06:10.80 --> 02:06:16.96 the uniform and those who have paid the ultimate price then I'm making my decisions through
02:06:16.96 --> 02:06:25.52 different lens and a different context then folks are used to in Washington and it's not to say like
02:06:25.52 --> 02:06:29.44 hey I'm just going gangbusters and I'm going to go run through a freaking brick wall no matter what
02:06:29.44 --> 02:06:33.44 the consequence and it it is being clear I'd about okay here here here are the here are the
02:06:33.44 --> 02:06:38.80 potential ramifications to this and sometimes they are known and sometimes they are an unknown factor
02:06:38.80 --> 02:06:50.32 but ultimately these major decision points that I have come across do the right thing if you don't
02:06:50.32 --> 02:06:55.12 if you don't know and you're not sure and all these it like ultimately do the right thing
02:06:55.84 --> 02:07:06.80 because it's the right thing and even even as you may get you know the you know the political
02:07:06.80 --> 02:07:11.52 fire or the the negative consequences or these other things like ultimately whether it takes a
02:07:11.52 --> 02:07:16.72 little time or it takes a long time doing the right thing is always the right thing and I'm you know
02:07:16.72 --> 02:07:24.72 I'm I'm able to know that wherever my path goes I've done my best to make that best decision
02:07:24.72 --> 02:07:34.40 when faced with hard right easy wrong the I used to tell my guys if you're doing the right
02:07:34.40 --> 02:07:39.28 things for the right reasons you we will win in the end exactly so if we're doing the right things
02:07:39.28 --> 02:07:43.92 for the right reasons we'll win in the end now what's interesting about this is you know you
02:07:45.68 --> 02:07:50.000 on certain occasions to some extent you didn't play the game right and as you just said you
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.76 played the game sometimes and you did which had to do and form those relationships and then
02:07:53.76 --> 02:07:59.20 sometimes you didn't play the game and this is what's interesting and that this is where the
02:07:59.20 --> 02:08:04.08 future's unknown where does that lead if you were doing the right things for the right reasons which you were
02:08:04.96 --> 02:08:10.16 ultimately you'll win in the long run wait I don't know what that looks like yet right at some point
02:08:10.16 --> 02:08:17.12 I know it's like a big gamble right because we could paint an entire different picture of
02:08:17.12 --> 02:08:22.80 Tulsi that went to Washington played the game said the right things vote the right votes not at the
02:08:22.80 --> 02:08:28.40 head and you'd be in a different spot than you are right now you'd be you could potentially I mean
02:08:28.40 --> 02:08:34.08 from your trajectory when you look at you in 2000 as I when you showed up 2012 when you showed up in
02:08:34.08 --> 02:08:41.84 2012 your trajectory was steep and like you said you checked various boxes that needed to be checked
02:08:43.28 --> 02:08:46.64 and if you would have played the game that whole time you could be in a position right you know
02:08:46.64 --> 02:08:53.36 you could be president right now you could be president right now having conformed to what you were
02:08:53.36 --> 02:09:00.32 being told to do now we don't know where this actually ends up right because it's it's 2020 we
02:09:00.32 --> 02:09:05.84 don't know where this ends up maybe people will be listening to this in 2039 or whatever now we go oh yeah
02:09:05.84 --> 02:09:10.80 jacco call that jacco call that you do the right things that are right reason to look at how we
02:09:10.80 --> 02:09:14.64 turned out that that could potentially happen but of course you know a bunch of other things you have
02:09:14.64 --> 02:09:21.92 too but it's it's something that we have to struggle with as leaders doing if but if I still believe
02:09:21.92 --> 02:09:25.76 this and I tell people this all the time if you're doing the right things for the right reasons you're
02:09:25.76 --> 02:09:33.28 going to win in the end in the end you are going to win it might take years it might take I guess
02:09:33.28 --> 02:09:38.88 it could take decades when you're talking about this these types of decisions but the other component
02:09:38.88 --> 02:09:44.40 of this is which I think in my just just from sitting here looking at you as you're talking about this
02:09:44.40 --> 02:09:54.24 you every day have to look yourself in the mirror and at a certain point you say I'm not going to
02:09:54.24 --> 02:10:01.12 do that and again look there's I always tell people play the long take play the long game thanks
02:10:01.12 --> 02:10:05.84 strategic I tell people I would say when people ask me oh I've got some situation at work and
02:10:05.84 --> 02:10:10.64 I brought this to me do this all the time I'd give the I give the best play the game oh tell
02:10:10.64 --> 02:10:14.72 see wants me to do this paperwork and she's been yelling at me to do it and he doesn't make any
02:10:14.72 --> 02:10:20.32 sense for me to do this paperwork I tell you do the paperwork play the game build a good relationship
02:10:20.32 --> 02:10:23.76 with all three so you can actually talk to in the future and explain why that paperwork doesn't
02:10:23.76 --> 02:10:29.92 make sense right play the game until you get to a point where you got to look at yourself in the mirror
02:10:30.64 --> 02:10:36.24 and you can't and then you're not doing the right thing and you're not doing it for the right
02:10:36.24 --> 02:10:43.44 reasons and you got to make a different decision yeah yeah I that that's exactly right and
02:10:44.40 --> 02:10:52.08 in order to do that it's it's being able to have not lost your foundation and your ground
02:10:52.08 --> 02:11:01.28 in this so that you have the ability to be introspective and to know what actually matters versus
02:11:01.28 --> 02:11:07.04 the things that that that don't really matter which help you determine you know which battles
02:11:07.04 --> 02:11:15.68 am I going to pick to fight and also what what is what is winning how do you define winning
02:11:16.96 --> 02:11:25.76 is it is it a specific title or is it a specific position or when you say do the right things for
02:11:25.76 --> 02:11:32.80 the right reasons and at some point in time sooner or later you're going to win for me in my case
02:11:33.52 --> 02:11:43.36 that that's that is 100% true I think what maybe maybe is not obvious to people is
02:11:44.72 --> 02:11:50.40 winning is not becoming president of the United States winning is not becoming a United States senator
02:11:50.40 --> 02:11:58.16 or a member of congress or an ambassador or whatever pick pick the job pick the crappy job
02:12:01.84 --> 02:12:07.52 you have a different perspective than most people in Washington who live their lives from college
02:12:07.52 --> 02:12:15.12 to try to strategically plan their lives to get these jobs except for the fact that you know winning
02:12:16.32 --> 02:12:19.44 you know look if you're the president you have a massive you have the most amount of influence that
02:12:19.44 --> 02:12:25.12 you could possibly have I used to tell that to these young seal officers it's like oh you're going to
02:12:25.12 --> 02:12:30.48 kiss ass to get promoted well if you kiss ass quote to get promoted guess what you can take
02:12:30.48 --> 02:12:35.20 it better care your troops the which is why you're here right that's why we're here to take
02:12:35.20 --> 02:12:40.40 care of our team be able to accomplish the mission so sometimes it's like there those those are
02:12:40.40 --> 02:12:48.000 aligned winning when I'm a platoon commander instead of a E5 and a platoon I have more influence
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.40 over that situation so I can do a better job of the mission I can do a better job attacking the
02:12:52.40 --> 02:12:57.44 enemy and I can do a better job of taking care of the guys that work for me that's all good and you
02:12:57.44 --> 02:13:00.96 know what I had to sit through some meetings I had to nod my head and I had to support my
02:13:00.96 --> 02:13:04.24 whatever commanding officer or my master chief when they told me to do something that didn't
02:13:04.24 --> 02:13:09.04 make quite make sense but I did it why not so I could get promoted that's the big difference not
02:13:09.04 --> 02:13:14.96 so I could get promoted and I never did it it was as you know for me it was such a it made my career
02:13:14.96 --> 02:13:20.32 so much easier because I never was worried about getting promoted I never cared if I got promoted
02:13:21.52 --> 02:13:24.88 and it actually helped it helped because I was doing the right things for the right reasons and
02:13:24.88 --> 02:13:28.16 my boss is what look at me and say like yeah this guy cares about the guys and he wants to get
02:13:28.16 --> 02:13:32.56 the mission done let's get him promoted yeah I wasn't doing it to get promoted it's just gonna happen
02:13:32.56 --> 02:13:36.56 if you're doing the right things for the right reasons yeah so there's a weird dichotomy there
02:13:36.56 --> 02:13:41.60 no winning isn't necessarily getting promoted or becoming the president or whatever the case may be
02:13:41.60 --> 02:13:45.68 but if you're looking to have the most amount of influence that take care of your people and your
02:13:45.68 --> 02:13:50.40 troops and your country and your nation that's a really good spot to be in and that that the order
02:13:50.40 --> 02:13:55.28 of that I think is the most important thing because too often in politics people get so attached to
02:13:55.28 --> 02:14:01.20 the position or the title and their entire identity is wrapped around that whether they have it or
02:14:01.20 --> 02:14:07.44 it is their ambition to achieve that position or title that they forget that the real goal is being
02:14:07.44 --> 02:14:13.68 in a position of impact and influence where you can serve and make that positive impact and that's
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:18.56 where for me even from when I ran for state house through the different political positions that I've
02:14:18.56 --> 02:14:25.04 had like I had no issue and no qualms about walking away from what was beginning what was the
02:14:25.04 --> 02:14:30.56 beginning of some would say would be in a lustre's political career as as a 21 year old elected
02:14:30.56 --> 02:14:36.64 the state house when it came for that decision point are you going to stay or you're going to go I went
02:14:37.36 --> 02:14:43.68 because I wasn't losing anything and like people are going to give up this political career you've
02:14:43.68 --> 02:14:51.44 only just begun I'm not giving up anything I am only choosing at this point to serve in a different
02:14:51.44 --> 02:14:57.36 way and I think that's where when you look at when I've thought about okay well you know winning
02:14:57.36 --> 02:15:04.96 is being in that position of impact and influence and and maybe at some point it does take that form of
02:15:05.92 --> 02:15:10.56 you know serving an elected office in a high position where I can execute on that or maybe it
02:15:10.56 --> 02:15:15.84 takes a different form or a different shape you know for the time being or for whatever it is
02:15:15.84 --> 02:15:22.08 it's staying the order of that staying focused okay this is the goal and the position and the
02:15:22.08 --> 02:15:27.20 platform that I may have at a different point in time to accomplish that goal doesn't change the goal.
02:15:28.16 --> 02:15:32.000 Did you underestimate the power of the swamp?
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:50.72 Well maybe a little bit but I think even yeah I would say yeah I mean the power of
02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:56.40 the political infrastructure and the party system and how much money
02:15:56.40 --> 02:16:03.36 you know they're limits like if I'm well if when I ran for present around for Congress they're
02:16:03.36 --> 02:16:08.64 limits like if you wanted to make a political contribution to me you know the limit changes
02:16:08.64 --> 02:16:15.36 every election but let's say it's $2,000 that's all you can give. There's no there's no real
02:16:15.36 --> 02:16:21.04 limit to what you can give to either political party so if you wanted to write a $2,000 check
02:16:21.04 --> 02:16:27.92 you could do that no problem and so if you look at the the balance of power that gives the political
02:16:27.92 --> 02:16:37.52 parties a heck of a lot of power to to leverage over a specific candidate or specific and
02:16:37.52 --> 02:16:43.20 combat and to use as the use in the power plays that are you so that that was something that
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:50.72 that I came into and I think was was unexpected. So just to clarify this I can give
02:16:50.72 --> 02:16:59.04 $2,000 to Tulsi for Congress but I can give $2 million to the Democratic now or $200 million
02:16:59.60 --> 02:17:06.24 or whatever. And therefore the party has that money. Yes. And now they can go all
02:17:06.24 --> 02:17:13.12 it out to the people that are playing with the program that are playing the game. And it's a
02:17:13.12 --> 02:17:18.48 little surprising to you who was a little surprised that how much control they had.
02:17:18.48 --> 02:17:24.80 And and seeing it play out literally on the house floor when votes are
02:17:26.24 --> 02:17:33.52 votes are happening or what about what happened. It's like hey where is this member of Congress?
02:17:33.52 --> 02:17:39.36 I heard he or she is thinking of voting with Republicans we need to find them and
02:17:40.56 --> 02:17:47.36 talk to him and get him in line. And they say and they're actual jobs like I don't you
02:17:47.36 --> 02:17:55.36 have you seen House of Cards? Yeah, you're fine don't worry about it. But it's featured in this
02:17:55.36 --> 02:18:01.12 show House of Cards the the the main character he kind of starts out he's a member of Congress and
02:18:01.12 --> 02:18:09.92 he is the whip and the position is literally called the whip and that's their job is they
02:18:09.92 --> 02:18:16.32 whip votes and so if somebody's you know so I go to you and I say hey Tulsi I know you're kind of
02:18:16.32 --> 02:18:20.64 wavering on this vote but it looks like you got a tough race coming up there and Hawaii could use
02:18:20.64 --> 02:18:27.20 some extra TV advertisement don't you think? Yeah. It's like that like for real yes that's how it is.
02:18:28.56 --> 02:18:34.64 Kind of or that's how it works. It takes different sometimes it can be very direct like that.
02:18:34.64 --> 02:18:42.88 I this is so this is something that that I have not personally directly been the target of
02:18:42.88 --> 02:18:50.72 because they knew. But partially because I I got elected without any help from the Democratic
02:18:50.72 --> 02:18:57.60 Party locally or nationally. There was no fundraising help there was no hey we're going to push you
02:18:57.60 --> 02:19:02.000 you know it was a primary election and generally they don't get involved in primary elections.
02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:08.16 It's not it's not a rule that's always followed but in my case it was and because it's such a strong
02:19:08.16 --> 02:19:12.72 Democratic state generally they'll use their resources to help Democrats get elected or
02:19:12.72 --> 02:19:17.60 reelected in swing districts or Republican districts if they're like, uh Tulsi you're good like
02:19:17.60 --> 02:19:23.44 we don't gotta worry about you in my case then that also means there's no leverage from them.
02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:29.92 But I have friends who I've served with who are in those positions where you know a reelection
02:19:29.92 --> 02:19:35.60 in a congressional race like they've got a race 10 million 20 million bucks which is you know in
02:19:35.60 --> 02:19:40.000 my race I think I raised I raised about I don't know a little over million dollars.
02:19:42.24 --> 02:19:49.28 So for them there is a lot of leverage and it's used it's certainly used to to try to get
02:19:50.32 --> 02:19:56.88 you as a member of Congress to do what what is best for the party rather than what you believe is the
02:19:56.88 --> 02:20:00.48 right thing to do based on your conscience and based on how you feel you can best serve.
02:20:00.48 --> 02:20:08.000 Yeah your constituents. What's the percentage that they're able to wield that sledge hammer
02:20:09.04 --> 02:20:18.32 effectively like how much control? I mean it's it's it's it's pervasive and so that that's one
02:20:18.32 --> 02:20:22.08 example is hey you've got it you're always getting you've got a tough reelection or a tough
02:20:22.08 --> 02:20:26.88 race or a tough challenger whatever that's one approach and the other approaches people who are
02:20:26.88 --> 02:20:34.72 interested in climbing the the ladder and so you will either have a cherry opportunity place before
02:20:34.72 --> 02:20:42.08 you or maybe you won't have that opportunity presented or it'll be taken away. So you know it's
02:20:42.08 --> 02:20:47.12 kind of like you know they'll look at okay what does this person want and what do they need and how
02:20:47.12 --> 02:20:54.16 can we use that as a motivator to try to get them to do what we want them to do and so this is the
02:20:54.16 --> 02:21:00.24 imbalance that needs to be corrected in our political system where this idea of hey anybody can
02:21:00.24 --> 02:21:04.72 go and run for Congress and I know that my member of Congress is always going to go and act in my
02:21:04.72 --> 02:21:11.36 best interest as a voter has unfortunately become so twisted into this thing that is about one
02:21:11.36 --> 02:21:16.72 party versus the other party and it's always about the next election and how they can battle and who is
02:21:16.72 --> 02:21:24.08 going to win rather than how do we work together and actually solve problems and pass meaningful
02:21:24.08 --> 02:21:29.44 legislation and I you know again early on you know there were there were some Republicans
02:21:30.96 --> 02:21:38.16 Obamacare right hugely divisive issue politically that's been weaponized by both sides issue of
02:21:38.16 --> 02:21:45.20 healthcare and there were some republic we found like hey here are some easy fixes this was this was
02:21:45.20 --> 02:21:51.28 that was elected in 2012 Obamacare was passed in 2010 and so you know there were some
02:21:51.28 --> 02:21:55.44 Democrats and Republicans we started to say hey let's figure out what we can do together like
02:21:55.44 --> 02:22:03.52 we're this is we're here in Congress is why we are here and there were some easy kind of very
02:22:03.52 --> 02:22:09.36 simple common sense corrections that we could make it through legislation to this bill
02:22:09.36 --> 02:22:15.68 that are no brainers like not not controversial at all common sense no brainers exact okay sounds good
02:22:15.68 --> 02:22:21.76 good set of I like it and how that work out it turns out that both party leadership
02:22:23.84 --> 02:22:30.08 indirectly expressed opposition to this idea and what we were talking about doing
02:22:30.96 --> 02:22:36.96 on the democratic side because it would require that they would have to admit that the bill had
02:22:36.96 --> 02:22:44.24 some flaws that needed fixing and on the Republicans I'd opposed to it because if you fix
02:22:44.24 --> 02:22:49.68 Obamacare then what do you run against what do you criticize the other side for if you actually
02:22:49.68 --> 02:22:56.80 fix it in a way that it it helps people and if people start to like it then you can't raise money
02:22:56.80 --> 02:23:08.16 off of it and you can't weaponize it for political purposes and that's that was 2013 and unfortunately
02:23:08.16 --> 02:23:18.40 here we are in 2021 and it has only progressively escalated and gotten far worse far divisive to
02:23:18.40 --> 02:23:22.56 the point where as we sit here today you have the speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referring to
02:23:22.56 --> 02:23:32.08 Republicans as quote unquote the enemy within the enemy within and the implications of that
02:23:32.08 --> 02:23:37.52 like the actual legitimate implications of that where is when you make that statement
02:23:38.48 --> 02:23:45.12 that you do not trust people from the opposing party broadly she's not saying hey this one person
02:23:45.12 --> 02:23:49.44 I feel is a threat to our security and needs to be reported to law enforcement that's a different
02:23:49.44 --> 02:23:54.16 story if that if that were the case we have systems in our government to do that if you think a
02:23:54.16 --> 02:24:00.96 member of Congress poses a security threat to their colleagues report it to law enforcement do it
02:24:02.16 --> 02:24:06.32 but to throw this out in a public setting I think it wasn't a press conference you said that
02:24:07.36 --> 02:24:12.72 that they are the enemy within and other Democrats saying well I don't feel safe around my
02:24:12.72 --> 02:24:19.36 Republican colleagues what you're saying is that if any member and any Democrat goes and tries to
02:24:19.36 --> 02:24:26.72 have a conversation with or reach out to or work with a Republican they are working with the enemy
02:24:26.72 --> 02:24:35.60 they are collaborating with the enemy they are now traders to who to the country to Democrats
02:24:35.60 --> 02:24:49.28 where does that then lead and how is there any possibility of healing and unifying and
02:24:49.28 --> 02:25:08.32 reaching out to get past the inflammatory divisive state that we're in okay so we got that going for us
02:25:08.32 --> 02:25:20.08 it seems like I didn't track every move that you made but certainly one of the if not at least from
02:25:20.08 --> 02:25:26.16 what I know the biggest kind of move that you made that was outside the system is when you went against
02:25:26.16 --> 02:25:40.000 Hillary in 2016 for for president is that was at the straw that broke the camera was by one
02:25:41.44 --> 02:25:46.16 yeah and that was one of those that was one of those big decision points that I had
02:25:46.16 --> 02:25:55.12 where I couldn't I couldn't map out what the actual consequences to that decision would be
02:25:56.16 --> 02:26:03.20 so you knew I knew I knew I obviously knew it was it was a serious decision that would have
02:26:03.20 --> 02:26:09.84 serious implications but exactly what those implications would be I didn't I didn't know
02:26:09.84 --> 02:26:19.92 I had different political advisors and people who you know who knew Washington and who knew me
02:26:19.92 --> 02:26:24.24 giving me very serious warning and just saying what tells you this could be the end of the political
02:26:24.24 --> 02:26:31.60 road for you potentially so just know that before you make this decision and just just to back
02:26:31.60 --> 02:26:37.84 up a little bit why the the backstory that led to my making that decision was I was still
02:26:37.84 --> 02:26:44.56 Vice Chair of the DNC at that point and as an officer of the DNC the rules say you have to be
02:26:44.56 --> 02:26:50.40 neutral in a primary election that the DNC's role is to make sure that the primary election process
02:26:50.40 --> 02:26:57.92 is executed in a fair in a fair way so that voters have the opportunity to make their decision
02:26:58.48 --> 02:27:02.32 on who they would like to be the Democratic nominee to become the president of states and so
02:27:02.32 --> 02:27:07.28 that was my like okay I'm going to make sure that I fulfill that responsibility and make sure that
02:27:07.28 --> 02:27:14.88 our Democratic process works in in this primary and I had I know plans to get involved in the race
02:27:14.88 --> 02:27:21.92 at all and there were you know there were a number of you know this wasn't the reason why ultimately
02:27:21.92 --> 02:27:28.80 made the decision but there were a number of issues that started to present themselves
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:37.04 in seeing that the chair of the DNC at that time was making unilateral decisions about how
02:27:37.04 --> 02:27:43.84 the primary process would work that made it very clear that it would not be fair or neutral
02:27:43.84 --> 02:27:49.36 and that those the process decisions that were being made would favor Hillary Clinton over any
02:27:49.36 --> 02:27:56.16 other candidate and I and other officers of the DNC expressed privately and then
02:27:57.92 --> 02:28:03.52 our concerns and opposition a to the fact that like hey like we're off to the DNC you're asking
02:28:03.52 --> 02:28:07.92 us to attach our names to decision that you as the chair made but we had absolutely no discussion
02:28:07.92 --> 02:28:12.72 or input to it whatsoever and I'm not comfortable doing that and then when seeing there was no
02:28:13.60 --> 02:28:20.000 it was kind of like okay no like I don't care I don't care the decision's been made and that's it
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.60 and then airing some of those concerns publicly for the purpose of trying to bring some accountability
02:28:25.60 --> 02:28:33.04 and transparency to the process and just to just two two examples one was limiting the initial decision
02:28:33.04 --> 02:28:38.16 that that the chairman made or the chairman made was there would only be six debates in the primary
02:28:38.16 --> 02:28:44.80 election and to me that was ridiculous like there had never been so few debates ever and why
02:28:44.80 --> 02:28:48.96 why that number of debates mattered was because of the second decision that was made which was
02:28:48.96 --> 02:28:58.08 if any candidate participated in a non-DNC sanctioned debate or forum they would be banned from
02:28:58.08 --> 02:29:04.56 participating in any future DNC debate so you'd be punished for actually seeking out opportunities
02:29:04.56 --> 02:29:13.52 to talk to voters both of those decisions seem pretty undemocratic to me while we're standing
02:29:13.52 --> 02:29:17.92 here saying hey we want we want high voter turnout we want people to engage in the process
02:29:17.92 --> 02:29:22.24 we want people to engage with the candidates but we're only going to allow six debates and if they
02:29:22.24 --> 02:29:29.52 do any debate or forum that's not one of our six then they won't be able to come and play with us at all
02:29:30.32 --> 02:29:34.56 because Hillary had such good name and recognition every one of these debates would be an opportunity
02:29:34.56 --> 02:29:40.64 for someone else to get more written name recognition yeah and challenge her track record I mean
02:29:40.64 --> 02:29:46.48 actually God forbid have a real dialogue and conversation and a compare and contrast for voters on
02:29:47.36 --> 02:29:51.12 each of you know I mean obviously Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were kind of the two primary
02:29:51.12 --> 02:29:54.64 candidates but there were a few others who were still running at that time Martin O'Malley was
02:29:54.64 --> 02:30:03.44 wanting to go for Maryland and so that that was kind of already happening but ultimately as
02:30:03.44 --> 02:30:13.04 as this process started to to begin I saw how even in these limited debate settings how
02:30:13.04 --> 02:30:17.68 little attention was being focused by the Democratic Party as well as their their corporate media
02:30:17.68 --> 02:30:27.60 partners on foreign policy and on the the qualifications that voters may look for in a commander
02:30:27.60 --> 02:30:35.12 in chief and what that responsibility meant it was just not it was you know they were talking
02:30:35.12 --> 02:30:41.52 about a bunch of other things most most things that to me like superficial political drama
02:30:41.52 --> 02:30:46.16 and theater like not issues that that really mattered a whole lot when you look at the
02:30:46.16 --> 02:30:53.04 implications on people everyday lives but as a soldier obviously for me like this is the most well
02:30:53.04 --> 02:30:57.76 it's not just as a soldier the most important responsibility that that any president has is to
02:30:57.76 --> 02:31:03.76 service commander and chief you know our constitution very clearly like I can have all the economic
02:31:03.76 --> 02:31:09.20 positions I want and positions on education and positions on health care as president I can't do
02:31:09.20 --> 02:31:17.04 anything of of great impact without working with Congress and that's I mean that that's the it's
02:31:17.04 --> 02:31:22.56 it's the check-in balance that our our founders had in mind for us which is a good thing but there's
02:31:22.56 --> 02:31:32.24 only one commander in chief and it ultimately drove me to resign as vice chair of the DNC
02:31:32.24 --> 02:31:43.04 and and in door Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton because I saw a huge gap and difference
02:31:43.04 --> 02:31:51.68 contrast between the two of them and in Hillary Clinton's very interventionist kind of war
02:31:51.68 --> 02:32:01.60 hawk war-monger track record both the secretary of state and and as a u.a. senator versus Bernie Sanders
02:32:01.60 --> 02:32:07.84 who through his time and service had proven to have more of a non-interventionist leaning
02:32:07.84 --> 02:32:14.88 and be a little bit more critical in questioning of any rush to war and I you know on a whole
02:32:14.88 --> 02:32:19.12 host of other issues I didn't you know Bernie and I agree or disagree on on a number of other
02:32:19.12 --> 02:32:25.76 issues but this was the singular issue that I made my decision on to to resign as vice chair of the
02:32:25.76 --> 02:32:33.28 DNC and endorse Bernie Sanders so that I would have a platform to start to push to be a voice
02:32:33.28 --> 02:32:39.04 to push this question and to challenge the media and to bring to voters here's the differences
02:32:39.04 --> 02:32:47.60 between the two major candidates in this primary you get to decide what kind of commander in chief
02:32:47.60 --> 02:32:59.36 uh you want and so um that was you know I I announced that decision on um Sunday show meet the press
02:33:00.24 --> 02:33:06.16 there in Washington went to the studio um didn't tell him really what I was there to announce it was you
02:33:06.16 --> 02:33:13.20 know I intentionally kept this to myself very very close hold knowing how when sestuous the
02:33:13.20 --> 02:33:21.76 relationships are between politicians and the media and attempts to try to um undermine my ability
02:33:21.76 --> 02:33:31.84 to deliver my message for myself and uh so they're probably like two people in my life who knew
02:33:31.84 --> 02:33:38.72 what I was gonna do uh went live television Sunday morning shared my decision and why
02:33:38.72 --> 02:33:44.72 and then uh you know my phone started ringing off the hook literally I'm in the car rolling away
02:33:44.72 --> 02:33:52.24 from this studio but but the most stark response I got was um and they ranged from like
02:33:53.04 --> 02:34:01.28 tell see that was a brave uh and righteous decision to like you yeah exactly and that's it was
02:34:01.28 --> 02:34:04.96 that was Sunday and then I think it was either Monday or Tuesday we had votes and went back into session
02:34:04.96 --> 02:34:11.92 in congress and and um both Democrats and Republican colleagues of mine were kind of coming up and
02:34:11.92 --> 02:34:19.04 patting me on the back and they're saying that like nice knowing you have a good after life
02:34:19.84 --> 02:34:28.16 and even even some Democrats who who had um like endorsed Obama over Hillary in 2008 early like
02:34:28.16 --> 02:34:35.60 from the beginning and who shared like hey like uh I made that decision and I was on the
02:34:35.60 --> 02:34:42.40 Clint shit list for years before I was able to dig myself out of it and tell see don't you know
02:34:42.40 --> 02:34:49.68 that she's gonna win and you're gonna be on the list and that there is a list and what that means
02:34:49.68 --> 02:34:55.68 in a practical way is you don't get your bill signed into law you don't get funding for the
02:34:55.68 --> 02:35:01.92 things that you need or that your constituents need in your district and that your efforts
02:35:03.28 --> 02:35:08.16 the reason why you're here in the efforts that you are putting forward will be will be blocked
02:35:08.16 --> 02:35:15.04 and so you're rendering yourself ineffective because she will be president and um
02:35:16.48 --> 02:35:21.12 that was that was the Washington response basically you're politically dead
02:35:21.12 --> 02:35:32.48 um you you knew that though right yeah I knew I knew I I was like I I chuckled as people told
02:35:32.48 --> 02:35:36.72 me this I was there was nothing there was nothing that I heard the morning after that did that
02:35:36.72 --> 02:35:41.68 surprise me I knew that there was a kind of feel like a badass when you walked into Congress on Monday
02:35:43.28 --> 02:35:49.84 did you cry I don't I'm not badass or did you feel like a idiot no neither neither I was I was
02:35:49.84 --> 02:35:59.28 um I was amused at like the hushed air for real right yeah for real no joke and like the sideways
02:35:59.28 --> 02:36:06.08 glances like is it okay to go and talk to her now or not and like I don't want to be you know
02:36:07.04 --> 02:36:12.40 like thought to be I don't know part of whatever she's doing like I don't know like there's all these
02:36:12.40 --> 02:36:18.72 different things and how about the fact that now like whoever told you hey now all the things you're
02:36:18.72 --> 02:36:22.64 gonna try to do are gonna get squashed you're not gonna be able to make any progress here that's a
02:36:22.64 --> 02:36:30.40 real thing and so again going back to this strategic decision making if you're trying to take
02:36:30.40 --> 02:36:38.56 here your constituents and you make the worst enemy that you can have in DC that's not good
02:36:40.88 --> 02:36:44.96 well what what I what ended up happening obviously as she did not win the election
02:36:44.96 --> 02:36:53.04 and some of those very same people who remain good friends of mine who were being honest with me then
02:36:53.04 --> 02:36:59.04 saying you're politically finished then came back to me later and said well turns out
02:37:00.24 --> 02:37:06.88 you saw something that nobody else saw at that time so you know
02:37:06.88 --> 02:37:13.36 couldows to you for standing up for your principles and what you believe in and listening to
02:37:14.24 --> 02:37:22.88 both your heart but also recognizing where people in the country are rather than
02:37:22.88 --> 02:37:32.32 listening to the echo chamber within Washington and yeah so so so at that point you got a little
02:37:32.32 --> 02:37:39.92 close back yeah yeah but it's all it's all not I have did the holder really I mean there there
02:37:39.92 --> 02:37:46.56 are there there's a unquestionable that a lot of the the challenges that I that I faced as I was
02:37:46.56 --> 02:37:57.36 running for president can be traced back to that original sin and just how deep you know yeah
02:37:57.36 --> 02:38:04.08 there there there were certainly ramifications but also it was I mean I had the opportunity to
02:38:04.08 --> 02:38:08.88 raise the issues that I ran for Congress to raise and to bring them to the forefront and to get
02:38:08.88 --> 02:38:16.56 conversation starting about you know the issues of war and peace and and when do when is it
02:38:16.56 --> 02:38:23.12 right to send our troops into battle and and what questions should we be asking as leaders in this
02:38:23.12 --> 02:38:30.16 country before we make that decision and recognize like I'm not a pacifist I'm not a piece Nick I
02:38:31.52 --> 02:38:37.12 I care and have dedicated my adult life to that that service to protecting our national
02:38:37.12 --> 02:38:43.28 security the safety of the American people I am just pushing to make sure that we have leaders in
02:38:43.28 --> 02:38:55.28 this country who recognize the seriousness of of of life and death of war and peace and
02:38:56.48 --> 02:39:04.32 when war may be actually necessary and warranted and knowing that our troops have volunteered to go
02:39:04.32 --> 02:39:09.52 knowing that that may mean a sacrificing of their own lives and all of the sacrifices that our loved ones
02:39:09.52 --> 02:39:15.36 and families make and don't think twice about it that's what we sign up for to serve our country
02:39:17.68 --> 02:39:24.56 but also knowing that sometimes the tougher decision to make is to not go to war
02:39:25.68 --> 02:39:31.44 the harder decision may be recognizing that even as there may be a problem that that
02:39:31.44 --> 02:39:40.40 we want to solve in the world that sometimes it requires more strength and courage to recognize
02:39:40.40 --> 02:39:50.08 a it's a problem we can't solve be it trying to do so would not serve our national security
02:39:50.08 --> 02:39:56.24 interests or the or the interests of of the American people and therefore recognizing that the
02:39:56.24 --> 02:40:05.76 right answer may be to do not do anything so so really that's the other part of the strategic move
02:40:05.76 --> 02:40:09.84 is strategically it's going to make you harder and it's going to make your job harder and some
02:40:09.84 --> 02:40:15.20 respects after you execute this move on on Hillary but at the same time it's going to bring
02:40:15.20 --> 02:40:20.96 these important issues to light so strategically it there's an advantage and a disadvantage
02:40:20.96 --> 02:40:26.56 yes and you wait them out and said you know what if I don't bring these subjects to light no one
02:40:26.56 --> 02:40:35.76 is going to do it I could not I could not I was not okay with sitting on the sidelines and watch this
02:40:36.64 --> 02:40:40.32 every presidential election is important there's not a single why every every
02:40:40.32 --> 02:40:45.76 effort election like this is the most important election of our lifetimes every single one is
02:40:45.76 --> 02:40:55.36 important and I could not live with myself if I had chosen to sit on the sidelines and let this
02:40:55.36 --> 02:41:04.64 whole thing play out without doing my very best to insert these most important questions and
02:41:04.64 --> 02:41:11.12 issues and contrasting of records into the dialogue and conversation so that voters would have the
02:41:11.12 --> 02:41:19.36 ability to make the best informed decision possible so then you decide you're going to run
02:41:19.36 --> 02:41:25.28 when is that that's what when do you figure that out when do you figure out when do you
02:41:25.28 --> 02:41:40.32 say to yourself you know what I need to run for president the event that triggered the event
02:41:40.32 --> 02:41:49.28 that ultimately led to my making that decision was the happened in January of 2018 and it was I'm
02:41:49.28 --> 02:41:59.60 sure you remember this echo but it was when on a Saturday morning we got a text alert sent out
02:41:59.60 --> 02:42:10.000 every cell phone in the state civil defense alarms sounding saying missile incoming to Hawaii seek
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:22.08 immediate shelter this is not a drill and the aftermath of that where immediately we're thinking
02:42:22.08 --> 02:42:29.92 like I've been working the issue related to North Korea for a very long time for obvious reasons
02:42:29.92 --> 02:42:34.24 that North Korea is continuing to develop their nuclear capabilities they're developing their
02:42:34.24 --> 02:42:40.96 intercontinental ballistic missile range capabilities miniaturize nuclear warheads that that not only
02:42:40.96 --> 02:42:45.68 could reach Hawaii but could reach a significant portion of the mainland at that time in 2018 now
02:42:45.68 --> 02:42:50.56 they have continued to develop that and they can reach anywhere in the country but this is the
02:42:50.56 --> 02:42:58.88 scenario that's playing out get this message North Korea is sending you know a nuclear missile
02:42:58.88 --> 02:43:08.24 to us which means we have 15 minutes to live I was in DC when this happened
02:43:11.28 --> 02:43:15.92 all of my loved ones my family everyone is in Hawaii and
02:43:15.92 --> 02:43:27.12 what happened there was absolutely terrifying where you know there there was a video that came
02:43:27.12 --> 02:43:34.48 out after was an iPhone video that this this father took as he lowered his little eight-year-old
02:43:34.48 --> 02:43:41.60 girl by having she was about eight years old down a manhole telling her that this is the only place
02:43:41.60 --> 02:43:49.92 you'll be safe and with the camera saying like if I don't make it you know at least I want you to be
02:43:49.92 --> 02:43:59.52 okay there's countless countless stories of people that I heard from after this event happened about
02:44:00.80 --> 02:44:06.64 about what they went through in you know there was a guy who he had like he had one of his kids
02:44:06.64 --> 02:44:11.76 that was in town another kid that was on the west side of the island and in why and I and he was
02:44:11.76 --> 02:44:18.72 somewhere in the middle and in that moment got that message trying to decide which am I going to
02:44:18.72 --> 02:44:24.64 drive to town or drive to why and I which of my kids am I going to try to get to to spend those
02:44:24.64 --> 02:44:33.12 last minutes of my life with you know mothers going in the bathtub like seek shelter everyone's
02:44:33.12 --> 02:44:37.76 look where do I go friend of mine he's got like a ton of kids I don't know six or seven kids
02:44:37.76 --> 02:44:43.60 he just started driving to the mountains like I just got to go find a cave somewhere and but
02:44:43.60 --> 02:44:50.24 but there was no shelter there's no shelter and so you got this fancy alert system and like okay
02:44:50.24 --> 02:44:55.68 it's blasting out seek immediate shelter there is there is no shelter what what ended up happening
02:44:55.68 --> 02:45:01.84 in those minutes that followed for me as soon as I got that notification on my phone I'm in DC I
02:45:01.84 --> 02:45:09.20 like like it's a holy shit what is happening I need to figure out what's happening and so
02:45:09.20 --> 02:45:15.52 I just started like going through okay I know that I can probably try to reach Indo-Paycom like
02:45:15.52 --> 02:45:20.64 command cell I don't have they don't bring cell phones in the building so that's the problem
02:45:20.64 --> 02:45:26.32 I ended up the first person I called was our state-adjust in general who I knew if something was
02:45:26.32 --> 02:45:30.40 happening he was going to be at that civil defense command and he would obviously know
02:45:30.40 --> 02:45:36.80 and so I called him and I said what's going on he's also my boss in the national guard
02:45:38.32 --> 02:45:45.12 so you know do you will had it there but I called him and I said what's going on and very quickly
02:45:45.12 --> 02:45:52.72 he said it's a false alarm I said I'm gonna put this out publicly you're telling me this is a
02:45:52.72 --> 02:45:58.56 false alarm and he said somebody pushed the wrong button false alarm said there's no missile
02:45:58.56 --> 02:46:05.92 command no missile coming in so I immediately hung up with him typed out a tweet in big block
02:46:05.92 --> 02:46:11.76 letters this is a false alarm I have confirmed with authorities there is no missile incoming
02:46:12.96 --> 02:46:21.20 and that tweet was the first public notification that went out that let people know
02:46:21.68 --> 02:46:26.24 what was going on but you know I just I was on the phone constantly I was calling new stations
02:46:26.24 --> 02:46:31.76 radio stations you know people were calling me and I just literally I was just like false alarm click
02:46:31.76 --> 02:46:36.48 false alarm click just trying to get let people know what was going on and there's a whole other
02:46:36.48 --> 02:46:41.20 you know like incompetence thing like there was no official notification to the public coming from
02:46:41.20 --> 02:46:46.80 the state government until 38 minutes after that initial alert was sent out and that was a
02:46:47.36 --> 02:46:51.76 that was a whole other issue but the thing that led me ultimately to make that decision like to
02:46:51.76 --> 02:46:56.64 start thinking about I need to run for present is because of what everyone went through and
02:46:56.64 --> 02:47:01.04 realizing that you can have this fancy alert system and I'm sure the governor and other people
02:47:01.04 --> 02:47:09.44 are all bunker down somewhere safe but there's no safety or shelter for anyone else and ultimately
02:47:11.12 --> 02:47:18.16 the fact that people the fact that this is a real threat that exists
02:47:18.16 --> 02:47:32.48 and there are others that politicians have created or escalated through political rhetoric
02:47:32.48 --> 02:47:39.84 of heightening tensions with nuclear arm countries, of spurring a nuclear arms race
02:47:41.44 --> 02:47:47.76 and knowing like okay you know that I'm sure there's probably some some mechanism or system in place
02:47:47.76 --> 02:47:52.96 to protect them and their families but what about everybody else in the country people who
02:47:54.96 --> 02:48:00.88 I mean look I mean nuclear war ends in other complete destruction of of the world ultimately
02:48:01.84 --> 02:48:09.84 and having gone through what we went through I wanted to be in a position to do two things
02:48:10.48 --> 02:48:15.12 by running for president I could raise this issue and bring it to the forefront because
02:48:15.12 --> 02:48:21.52 nobody was talking about it maybe there was a day of you know CNN coverage or whatever on what
02:48:21.52 --> 02:48:25.84 happened in Hawaii but then it was it was completely dropped and forgotten there was no like
02:48:25.84 --> 02:48:31.92 hold on a second so wait North Korea has these capabilities they're continually increasing
02:48:32.64 --> 02:48:38.24 this threat is real there is no shelter like if we get attacked then it's kind of it's game over
02:48:39.12 --> 02:48:43.52 what what's being done about this by the leaders and that none of that happened at all
02:48:43.52 --> 02:48:51.36 even in the aftermath of something that was you know terrifying and in such a real way
02:48:52.72 --> 02:49:00.08 and so to be able to address these issues and and the existential threat that we face that comes from
02:49:00.08 --> 02:49:06.40 that continued advancement towards the the brink of nuclear war that that that we're on
02:49:06.40 --> 02:49:14.80 and if elected to be in a position as commander and chief to begin to walk us back away from that
02:49:14.80 --> 02:49:19.44 brink and to actually do something about it to deescalate these tensions to actually work through
02:49:19.44 --> 02:49:25.28 the kinds of negotiations and treaties that previous presidents like you know Ray Yan and JFK did
02:49:25.84 --> 02:49:32.96 when they recognized the seriousness of what happens when you when you are in a cold war and when you
02:49:32.96 --> 02:49:39.12 have nuclear armed countries who either intentionally or accidentally can spark a nuclear war that
02:49:39.12 --> 02:49:48.08 would would result in the end of of humanity on this planet and that was that was the driver
02:49:48.08 --> 02:49:58.000 for me to make that decision to run and unfortunately I very quickly found out that
02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:08.24 neither the media nor the politicians were interested in talking about it or anything that really
02:50:08.24 --> 02:50:22.000 mattered that it was it was about who's saying bad things about who which candidate is you know
02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:29.60 who looks cool who's likeable who's all of these superficial things but whether it was on the debate
02:50:29.60 --> 02:50:39.36 stage when I raise these issues or in interviews with reporters one on one or I mean I talked about
02:50:39.36 --> 02:50:45.28 I talked obviously talked about these issues every day multiple times a day town hall meetings
02:50:45.28 --> 02:50:52.32 that reporters covered or were present for at least with the intent to cover what happened there was
02:50:52.32 --> 02:51:00.000 no interest in in talking about this specific issue about the existential threat of nuclear war
02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:07.36 and what how we got here and where we need to go to prevent it what to speak of of other issues and
02:51:07.36 --> 02:51:13.36 and that was that was the most frustrating those most frustrating thing about about running for
02:51:13.36 --> 02:51:18.000 president was the realization that even as a candidate for president of the United States
02:51:19.52 --> 02:51:27.92 the ability to bring such an issue as serious as this to the American people was so easily
02:51:27.92 --> 02:51:36.08 squashed by the corporate entertainment media and the politicians who benefit from them
02:51:36.08 --> 02:51:45.36 corporate entertainment media that's a good name for the news it's more accurate than news
02:51:46.64 --> 02:51:53.28 so you said you realized very quickly that that no one wanted to hear about this stuff like
02:51:53.28 --> 02:51:58.24 when you say very quickly how long did it take before you looked around and said wait a second
02:51:58.24 --> 02:52:06.96 because I remember hearing about you I mean maybe it was on rogan um I I forget but I remember thinking
02:52:06.96 --> 02:52:12.80 oh you know that's cool and it seemed to me wow what I said wow what a what a viable candidate that's
02:52:12.80 --> 02:52:19.76 interesting and I remember seeing some polling and you were at like 2% and I said oh that's kind of
02:52:19.76 --> 02:52:25.76 weird that's not a very big number at all I was kind of surprised and then maybe that was early on
02:52:25.76 --> 02:52:30.40 but at some point you know you were on rogan again or I saw you in a debate or something and I
02:52:30.40 --> 02:52:36.56 remember thinking oh I'm gonna check that out again she got to be at 30 or 40% now because the
02:52:36.56 --> 02:52:42.16 people that I know are kind of talking about her and I'd look and you'd be at 2% and I was kind
02:52:42.16 --> 02:52:49.12 it was very strange to me that you couldn't get you you weren't getting any traction was that weird to you
02:52:50.48 --> 02:52:54.40 because I mean you did the whole Hawaii thing where you were at 2% and then you went to 20 and then
02:52:54.40 --> 02:52:59.60 you went by 22 and here you are at 2% you like I know factor I got this been here done that
02:53:02.96 --> 02:53:08.16 at what point did you say oh damn this is a little harder than I thought it was going to be
02:53:08.16 --> 02:53:14.40 and was at the same realization as the media doesn't the media and the news and the entertainment
02:53:14.40 --> 02:53:23.92 networks don't care about this stuff the way I do there there were different signs of that
02:53:25.68 --> 02:53:30.96 the first of which started on the very day that I announced officially announced my
02:53:30.96 --> 02:53:40.48 candidacy as in build the event go up on the stage deliver the speech announcing my candidacy and why
02:53:40.48 --> 02:53:46.32 and I talked about them very thing that we talked about as as where did you drive it in Hawaii
02:53:47.04 --> 02:53:55.84 what was it what where outside yeah it was it was outside at in in Wikiki and
02:53:58.16 --> 02:54:05.12 you know there were local and national media cameras there to cover it and you know a bunch of
02:54:05.12 --> 02:54:12.80 supporters and then people came out while I was giving the speech and B.C. News put out an article
02:54:15.20 --> 02:54:23.28 basically making the accusation that I am somehow a favorite of the Russians or being helped by the
02:54:23.28 --> 02:54:32.32 Russians they're talking they're saying nice things I you know it was the article was so vague
02:54:32.32 --> 02:54:37.76 and baseless and lacking in any kind of evidence to back up the claim that they were making that
02:54:38.64 --> 02:54:43.28 it was just it was just so out there and and I knew that they were doing an article because they
02:54:43.28 --> 02:54:48.88 had called and asked for a comment like a few days prior and had said you know without knowing the
02:54:48.88 --> 02:54:53.92 extent of like the the completeness of the article but they said hey you know what I what do you think
02:54:53.92 --> 02:54:58.88 about this and and and they had said okay yeah we're going to publish the article probably
02:54:58.88 --> 02:55:04.56 sometime next week maybe one day or Thursday and I think I think that my announcement was on a
02:55:04.56 --> 02:55:11.60 Saturday whatever day it was they changed their schedule for when they were going to publish the
02:55:11.60 --> 02:55:18.80 article so that it came out on the day that they knew I'd be announcing my candidacy and there's
02:55:18.80 --> 02:55:25.44 thing is like the Russians like Tulsi that's the that's the general and you know like Russian bots
02:55:25.44 --> 02:55:31.52 are like you know Russians state sponsored media or the thing was is you know I think they they
02:55:32.48 --> 02:55:38.48 said oh you know there are a lot of articles that are proving that the Russians like her something
02:55:38.48 --> 02:55:44.56 like that but when you actually go and and look at look at the articles they're citing it's it's
02:55:46.16 --> 02:55:51.76 not accurate first of all and second of all it lacks the context of like hey
02:55:51.76 --> 02:55:57.28 um they're actually just reporting that she's announced that she's running for president
02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:04.96 or uh lacks the context of well when Hillary and Obama ran against each other in 2008
02:56:06.72 --> 02:56:13.76 the Russian media reported much more favorably for Obama than Hillary and so they they chose a narrative
02:56:13.76 --> 02:56:21.76 and chose to launch it on day one of my candidacy that Tulsi would be the the the the Russian
02:56:21.76 --> 02:56:28.48 asset or the favorite of the Russians and planted that seat on day one um you know cited oh you know
02:56:28.48 --> 02:56:36.72 she's gotten donations from for campaign from people who favor Russia and you know one happened
02:56:36.72 --> 02:56:43.28 to be like a Ivy League professor and specializes in foreign policy and is talked about nuclear war
02:56:43.28 --> 02:56:50.24 for decades and you know one was a woman who was trying to promote you know diplomacy and actually
02:56:50.24 --> 02:56:56.40 building relationships between like at a grassroots level between American educators and Russian
02:56:56.40 --> 02:57:04.64 educators or business owners or whatever I mean the the it was just a it was preposterous and very
02:57:04.64 --> 02:57:10.40 transparent a transparent signal and move on day one so that yes one that it start that's when it
02:57:10.40 --> 02:57:15.52 started and then of course it it it continued to progress and escalate and I started to see
02:57:15.52 --> 02:57:23.12 both on the debate stage as the debate started to begin as well as um you know you know you
02:57:23.12 --> 02:57:26.48 nice talked earlier when you know you know you know when you're going into doing an interview like a
02:57:26.48 --> 02:57:33.12 media hit it's probably gonna be four to five minutes long and you know you go in there knowing
02:57:33.12 --> 02:57:37.12 what you want to talk about regardless of the question that they ask you because you know you got like
02:57:37.12 --> 02:57:45.60 you know two senses exactly and so this this was why I was running for president so I took
02:57:45.60 --> 02:57:51.68 every opportunity to raise it on every platform possible and there were no follow-ups there was
02:57:51.68 --> 02:57:57.52 let there was no like oh hey like let's dig deeper into this issue which is clearly very serious no none
02:57:57.52 --> 02:58:02.40 of that it was like well you know what do you think about this candidate what do you think about Trump
02:58:02.40 --> 02:58:11.20 or what do you think about this like superficial drama um and a conscious choice away from actually
02:58:11.20 --> 02:58:19.36 talking about what mattered most and ended you know Hillary Clinton weighed in on the thing when when she
02:58:19.36 --> 02:58:25.44 said that I forget the exact words but basically the Russians have chosen their candidate
02:58:26.08 --> 02:58:31.28 and without saying my name said it was me and that was then covered by the media
02:58:31.28 --> 02:58:40.40 insessantly which is like crazy it is it is and it was a signaling in of itself like why would
02:58:41.20 --> 02:58:45.36 why would the former secretary of state former presidential candidate former US senator former
02:58:45.36 --> 02:58:55.04 first lady go out of her way to place the target on me and why can't the Russian bots do better than
02:58:55.04 --> 02:59:01.92 2% in the polls are the Russian bots are so freaking powerful why can't they run up your numbers
02:59:01.92 --> 02:59:09.20 a little bit for yeah not not not so much but it it eventually got to the point where
02:59:11.36 --> 02:59:16.96 not like the coverage that I got in that a largely being negative attempts to smear my
02:59:16.96 --> 02:59:25.44 candidacy or question my patriotism and my loyalty so out of the gate I mean is this is this a
02:59:25.44 --> 02:59:31.12 grand conspiracy where they're like oh yeah Tulsi she went against Hillary in 2016 get ready
02:59:31.12 --> 02:59:37.68 we're putting her down and what I certainly appeared that and on top of that hey Tulsi she's we can't
02:59:37.68 --> 02:59:41.52 control her this isn't going to work we don't want someone that we can't control put her down
02:59:41.52 --> 02:59:56.24 it's certainly appeared that way because that was if you look at the outcome it was the outcome
02:59:56.24 --> 03:00:03.12 that that I think they were looking for and again it started from the beginning it ended up with a
03:00:03.12 --> 03:00:12.56 total total media blackout by the end of it polling standards changed to make it so that
03:00:13.28 --> 03:00:17.68 it's like okay here they say hey you got a poll at a certain level in order to qualify for the debate
03:00:17.68 --> 03:00:22.48 and then qualify for the next debate and you know the polling standards often shifted based on
03:00:22.48 --> 03:00:27.68 where you were right like that's that's a little convenient to change it right when I start
03:00:27.68 --> 03:00:34.16 inching up in the polls a little bit more but it also just points to like the the catch 22 that exists
03:00:34.16 --> 03:00:40.88 where in America we'd like to believe that anybody can run for president anybody can run for
03:00:40.88 --> 03:00:45.28 office and that it's up to the candidate to go and make your case to voters and voters actually
03:00:45.28 --> 03:00:53.12 get to decide well in these presidential races so early on you can have very well known
03:00:53.12 --> 03:00:58.32 candidates that everybody in the country's heard of and you can have lesser known candidates that most
03:00:58.32 --> 03:01:05.04 people have like no knowledge of whatsoever well they start running these polls so early on
03:01:05.76 --> 03:01:13.28 that show lesser known candidate like myself at 1% or 2% whereas the better known candidates are
03:01:13.28 --> 03:01:17.20 pulling much higher and then make the determination well Tulsi Gabbard's not a viable candidate
03:01:17.20 --> 03:01:22.16 because he's only pulling it 2% so we're not going to really cover her very much because we don't
03:01:22.16 --> 03:01:30.08 deem her as a viable candidate and by we I mean the media and the political party and so as a
03:01:30.08 --> 03:01:33.84 lesser known candidate then you're not covered as much as the better known candidate so you don't
03:01:33.84 --> 03:01:40.96 have the opportunity to get better known and so it's this you know you're in the prophecy
03:01:40.96 --> 03:01:45.60 yeah of we know who dispersion is so we're going to keep covering it and it allows them to
03:01:45.60 --> 03:01:55.04 it allows them to decide who who they want voters to be exposed to and who they don't believe
03:01:55.04 --> 03:02:03.20 deserves that kind of opportunity to be in front of voters and so it's kind of a pre-selection
03:02:03.20 --> 03:02:10.96 a pre-primary selection before before any vote is cast you have these very powerful people
03:02:10.96 --> 03:02:19.12 within the party and within the media who who make those decisions about who gets to be heard and
03:02:19.12 --> 03:02:26.56 and who doesn't and that that was what we experienced and and it was it was such an incredible
03:02:26.56 --> 03:02:31.36 this was the thing I underestimated the most that I thought hey I can run for president and I can
03:02:31.36 --> 03:02:35.04 bring these ideas forward and yeah I'm at a disadvantage because I'm not as well known as some
03:02:35.04 --> 03:02:41.76 of these other guys but as long as I have the platform to be able to reach people all I got to
03:02:41.76 --> 03:02:46.32 do is like I all I got to do is do my best and trust that voters will make will make the decision
03:02:46.88 --> 03:02:55.04 I underestimated how very quickly and in a sustained way the media the decisions were made to
03:02:55.04 --> 03:03:02.000 to not even allow that platform to exist which left me in a pretty like a pretty helpless place you
03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:06.96 know I was yeah I can live stream my town hall and social media and I did I can reach it maybe a
03:03:06.96 --> 03:03:11.92 few more thousand people in addition to the thousand who were sitting in the room but when you look
03:03:11.92 --> 03:03:18.000 at the numbers in the country it you know when when they choose to not cover you and not allow you
03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:27.84 that platform then you know it's it's you're not only not only was I not able to to raise the issues
03:03:27.84 --> 03:03:35.76 and address the issues that that are not just important to me but important to our country but also
03:03:35.76 --> 03:03:43.92 the the smear attempts and the negative coverage left me in a very helpless and vulnerable position
03:03:43.92 --> 03:03:52.32 where I couldn't fight back I did not have you know did not have the means even if I were a
03:03:52.32 --> 03:04:01.68 billionaire which I'm not and I had a very very very skinny budget our our campaign was pretty
03:04:01.68 --> 03:04:06.88 much fueled by volunteers and I love them so much people who really believed and and set aside
03:04:06.88 --> 03:04:11.68 school or jobs or life and when worked their hearts out to help me get my message out
03:04:13.04 --> 03:04:18.000 but even if I were a well-funded candidate or a self-funded candidate and a billionaire that I
03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:22.56 could go out and purchase ads and I could go out and create by my own platform essentially
03:04:23.36 --> 03:04:31.68 if the media makes a decision to either not cover you or or to smear you and undermine
03:04:31.68 --> 03:04:40.80 therefore undermine whatever it is you're saying and doing it's it's it's um it's difficult
03:04:40.80 --> 03:04:47.52 if not impossible to beat and and I think this is so important to talk about because it is a
03:04:47.52 --> 03:04:54.32 charade of the democracy that we you believe exist in this country and it's certainly a
03:04:54.32 --> 03:05:00.16 charade of the democracy that our founders set out for us in this incredible
03:05:01.12 --> 03:05:04.64 imbalance of power and influence that's in the hands of a very few
03:05:04.64 --> 03:05:12.48 who don't have the best interests of the country at heart
03:05:17.28 --> 03:05:21.52 so we also got that going for us yeah and just to illustrate that I mean the the
03:05:21.52 --> 03:05:26.32 guy who is the CEO of CBS this is I think probably the most stark and direct example
03:05:26.32 --> 03:05:36.64 uh less moon vs his name and he this was this was um yeah I mean this this was in
03:05:36.64 --> 03:05:45.52 20 this was in 2016 that he said something along the lines of Trump may be bad for the country
03:05:45.52 --> 03:05:51.52 but he's good for business the money is rolling in keep it up Donald Trump keep it up
03:05:51.52 --> 03:06:02.08 and his very direct statement illustrates everything that's wrong because it shows that this
03:06:02.08 --> 03:06:08.24 corporate entertainment media it's about the money it's about the profits it's about the rating
03:06:08.24 --> 03:06:18.08 with no regard whatsoever for what the consequence is for the country and for voters and for
03:06:18.08 --> 03:06:31.12 our future and that is something very serious that we as people in this country need to
03:06:31.92 --> 03:06:40.08 understand be aware of so that we can start to bring about kind of the cultural and societal shifts
03:06:40.08 --> 03:06:48.32 that will ultimately result in in change and in making it so that you know these few
03:06:49.20 --> 03:06:59.52 powerful people don't get to you serve our democracy and our voice is being the voice is that
03:06:59.52 --> 03:07:04.64 matter most in determining who we want to serve as leaders in our country
03:07:04.64 --> 03:07:13.12 so with that you see Donald Trump getting the you know getting the nod from the Republicans
03:07:13.12 --> 03:07:19.52 which many many many Republicans did not want yeah him to be the candidate at all
03:07:20.72 --> 03:07:26.16 never trumpers and and so that was a real thing they there was a lot of people that a lot of
03:07:26.16 --> 03:07:31.20 Republicans that did not want and he was Republican party was not into him for much of the primary
03:07:31.20 --> 03:07:37.52 exactly like he was totally and actually somebody when when we were on uh Rogan's together
03:07:37.52 --> 03:07:41.92 and I said something like wow you got really hammered more than enough seen anyone and someone
03:07:41.92 --> 03:07:46.16 in the youtube comments said hey idiot what about Donald Trump I was like that's a good point
03:07:46.16 --> 03:07:53.28 they hated him apparently as much as they hated you in the democratic party how is it that he was
03:07:53.28 --> 03:08:02.96 able to pull it off does it does it is the Republican party less controlling than the democratic party?
03:08:02.96 --> 03:08:08.000 I don't know the answer to that specific question but how is he able to pull it off
03:08:09.76 --> 03:08:17.28 he was very famous and he had influence they couldn't black him out they couldn't
03:08:17.28 --> 03:08:23.68 ignore him and they were making a shit ton of money off of him because with Donald Trump brought
03:08:23.68 --> 03:08:32.40 eyeballs to their screens whether it was uh Fox News who was initially I think maybe cynical
03:08:32.40 --> 03:08:39.76 or even critical of him and then shifted to like full bore pro trump or if it was CNN and MSNBC
03:08:39.76 --> 03:08:46.72 who are I think initially kind of like how was this even happening to full bore anti-Trump
03:08:48.56 --> 03:08:54.40 regardless in all of these scenarios and from the democratic parties perspective and the
03:08:54.40 --> 03:09:02.88 Republican party's perspective with Trump came money. Democrats get to be the anti-Trump party
03:09:02.88 --> 03:09:09.84 and motivate a lot of people to give money to beat Trump or people who supported Trump and
03:09:09.84 --> 03:09:15.28 members of Congress or whatever and Republicans got to raise a lot of money off of hey look
03:09:15.28 --> 03:09:20.32 they're trying to attack us and they're trying to undermine what's going on and we need your money
03:09:20.32 --> 03:09:25.44 and we need your help to be able to you know defend the party and defend the work or whatever it is
03:09:25.44 --> 03:09:36.88 so that how I think that that's what ultimately ended up and it gave Trump a lot of exposure
03:09:38.24 --> 03:09:45.12 and yeah some some of it or maybe a lot of it was was was was was negative but you look at how
03:09:45.12 --> 03:09:51.84 much the public hates politicians and how much they distrust and hate the media you know you
03:09:51.84 --> 03:10:00.64 can kind of see how generally people who are frustrated and dissatisfied with the powerful
03:10:00.64 --> 03:10:05.84 inmate whether they be in politics or the media would look at it and I friends like this like
03:10:05.84 --> 03:10:09.68 they didn't really agree with anything that Trump was saying they're like finally somebody is
03:10:09.68 --> 03:10:14.16 giving the middle finger to the media and telling him to you know shut up or whatever it was
03:10:14.16 --> 03:10:29.76 Trump had influence and he was very well known and could not be ignored. So at some point
03:10:29.76 --> 03:10:35.92 the somebody come in to somebody come from the outside that's not as brash and not as offensive as
03:10:35.92 --> 03:10:44.88 Trump and would that not be pretty would that not be easier or was it because he's so brash
03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:52.32 and because he's so freaking quotable right good or bad you know he's just going to run they're
03:10:52.32 --> 03:10:56.32 going to put they're going to put his quotes up all day long if somebody comes along that's from the
03:10:56.32 --> 03:11:03.76 outside but that is actually less brash and more calm and more rational do they say okay
03:11:03.76 --> 03:11:08.72 it seems like that would be the the perfect candidate right now someone from the outside that
03:11:08.72 --> 03:11:15.20 can actually roll in and say look this system is totally screwed up we're going to like the the idea
03:11:15.20 --> 03:11:22.64 of draining the swamp was a great quote that's got so many legs or so much legs and you know of
03:11:22.64 --> 03:11:27.60 course it didn't really happen when you look this administration it was like oh yeah more people
03:11:27.60 --> 03:11:34.72 from the swamp or love yeah exactly but but when when someone does this in a more from a better
03:11:35.52 --> 03:11:41.60 from a better like from a better position it seems like it's well this is what I'm getting at
03:11:41.60 --> 03:11:44.40 because I was going to ask you well at some point is a reach a tipping point it seems like the
03:11:44.40 --> 03:11:49.04 tipping point there it's just that someone needs to step in and say okay we are going to actually
03:11:49.04 --> 03:11:53.44 drain out this swamp we're going to actually get rid of this there's lobbies are going to get you
03:11:53.44 --> 03:11:58.88 know controls put on them we're going to do things that we're going to move this in the right
03:11:58.88 --> 03:12:03.28 direction it seems like as you said Americans a lot of Americans are looking at the political
03:12:03.28 --> 03:12:07.04 system going you got to be kidding me and look you tell me stories earlier today before we hit
03:12:07.04 --> 03:12:14.24 record it's got it's sickening it's sickening and so as that word gets out it seems like America's
03:12:14.24 --> 03:12:20.16 ready to go you know what we're done with this shit over here and and Trump was like the first guy
03:12:20.16 --> 03:12:25.76 that said hey I'll help you out and so everyone it cool sounds good you go raise hell basically
03:12:26.64 --> 03:12:31.04 if someone that says yep we're going to fix it we're going to change it I'm for change I'm going to
03:12:31.04 --> 03:12:37.84 make things it seems like we are right for that I was going to ask you will we reach a tipping point
03:12:37.84 --> 03:12:42.64 it seems like we're already there Trump was the guy that got elected based on saying hey we're
03:12:42.64 --> 03:12:48.48 going to drain the swamp people voted for him to go and do that like you said people that you
03:12:48.48 --> 03:12:52.80 knew that didn't agree with any of his politics but he was changed he was different he was going to
03:12:52.80 --> 03:12:57.36 throw it in the face of the system that's where you're ready for and it just so happens at the guy
03:12:57.36 --> 03:13:00.80 that threw it in the face of the system also threw it in the face of everybody that was around him
03:13:01.20 --> 03:13:07.44 I mean just like a grenade going off it's just people are getting hit and there's no direction to it
03:13:07.92 --> 03:13:15.12 so it seems like we're actually ready for that what's it going to take to actually get someone there
03:13:15.12 --> 03:13:19.04 that's going to run that's going to that's that the truth will come out doing the right things
03:13:19.04 --> 03:13:30.32 so the right reasons is going to win in the end someone who has the resources and ammunition
03:13:30.32 --> 03:13:36.56 capable of going to battle with the existing political infrastructure and the corporate entertainment
03:13:36.56 --> 03:13:46.96 media that that's that's the matchup because I agree you know there are there are more people who
03:13:46.96 --> 03:13:52.08 identify as independence in the country today then there are who people who identify as either
03:13:52.08 --> 03:13:58.40 Democrats or Republicans really yes factually factually I go Charles we're going to use that word yes
03:13:59.44 --> 03:14:06.32 thanks that's factually true we can look up we I mean I mean I've seen a variety and this has been
03:14:06.32 --> 03:14:11.92 trending in this direction for quite some time this is not a new phenomenon but the numbers are consistently
03:14:11.92 --> 03:14:18.000 trending towards and and maybe some some of it's generational that that you know the millennial generation
03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:22.88 did not come up identifying like my daddy was a Democrat my granddaddy was a Democrat I got to be a
03:14:22.88 --> 03:14:29.12 Democrat I think there's there's less far less of that in the millennial in post millennial generation
03:14:30.24 --> 03:14:34.64 so I think that's part of it people are looking more at issues than party I think part of it is
03:14:34.64 --> 03:14:41.60 people recognizing and being disillusioned with with both political parties as not looking out for
03:14:41.60 --> 03:14:45.52 their best interest and it's more about the party than the people so I think there's a number of
03:14:45.52 --> 03:14:52.08 of reasons for this but it is a fact that it's over 40% of the country identify themselves as
03:14:52.08 --> 03:14:56.88 independent and therefore lesser numbers who identify as well as one party or another so are the
03:14:56.88 --> 03:15:03.92 people ready for a strong leader who will come in and speak to what's in the best interest of
03:15:03.92 --> 03:15:09.28 the country rather than what's in the best interest of one party or another I would say yes without
03:15:09.28 --> 03:15:20.64 it out so then the next question is how what is necessary to execute on that what is necessary is
03:15:20.64 --> 03:15:27.60 is first of all recognizing you know where's the opposition coming from the opposition will come from
03:15:27.60 --> 03:15:32.64 the people who are benefiting off the status quo and that is the existing two party system
03:15:32.64 --> 03:15:44.56 and the the the the the entertainment media that that is in bed with them and it's not impossible
03:15:44.56 --> 03:15:50.80 it's not insurmountable but it's a pretty serious obstacle and you got to be ready to go to battle
03:15:50.80 --> 03:15:59.52 with some of the most powerful people and so it would take a lot it would take a lot
03:15:59.52 --> 03:16:08.08 and the third party thing is what do you think is that is that dead on arrival not dead on arrival
03:16:08.56 --> 03:16:15.76 not impossible very difficult because I think it was it was back and I forget I think it was the
03:16:15.76 --> 03:16:21.36 first time that Ross Perot ran for president was also in Bill Clinton was running for president
03:16:22.08 --> 03:16:29.20 and I think George H.W. if I'm not mistaken yeah I figure right at a certain point well early on
03:16:29.20 --> 03:16:35.20 though early on at a certain point Ross Perot was pulling higher than Bill Clinton and I
03:16:35.20 --> 03:16:43.44 I believe George Bush as well and that like their like what is going like how is this possible
03:16:44.32 --> 03:16:50.24 and had he continued his campaign at a certain point Ross Perot dropped out of the race
03:16:50.24 --> 03:16:55.20 and then jumped back in a little bit later and he took a big hit for that I don't know
03:16:55.20 --> 03:16:59.36 people probably like want like do not know what you want or like what what are you doing buddy
03:17:01.04 --> 03:17:09.04 but there are political pundits who say that if he had continued on he you know who knows
03:17:09.04 --> 03:17:14.000 he may have become president or he may have posed a more serious threat in the end than he did
03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:19.84 ultimately his numbers took a dive after he re-enter the race and he ended up kind of just being
03:17:19.84 --> 03:17:26.64 the perennial third party guy who stole votes right but it was after that election year that
03:17:27.36 --> 03:17:34.000 the rules started to change in making it with with agreement from both the Democrat
03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:42.80 Republican Party that made it much more difficult for a third party candidate to get ballot access
03:17:42.80 --> 03:17:52.80 just to get their names on the ballot to be included in debates just the basic infrastructure of
03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:59.44 a candidacy changed to the point where and it still it still exists today that
03:18:00.32 --> 03:18:07.28 the the bar is much higher for a third party candidate to to be heard and to be on the ballot
03:18:07.28 --> 03:18:15.52 than it is for candidates who run under one party or or another so that that that just again
03:18:15.52 --> 03:18:23.36 not impossible but from a practical perspective as well as from an exposure perspective
03:18:24.80 --> 03:18:32.08 it's a much much much heavier lift that again requires a certain strategy and a hell of a lot
03:18:32.08 --> 03:18:38.72 of resources to be able to accomplish that so how long how long were you in the race for total
03:18:42.88 --> 03:18:50.80 I think I announced in February of 2019 and I withdrew from the race
03:18:50.80 --> 03:19:03.60 I think in March February or March of I think it was March of 2020 it was it was after COVID
03:19:03.60 --> 03:19:09.12 had kind of already started I was back in Hawaii COVID had started to take a pretty firm hold
03:19:09.12 --> 03:19:15.84 maybe it was even later than that and I just it got to the point where like run locked out at home
03:19:15.84 --> 03:19:24.80 in Hawaii Congress had shut down and I knew that the most effective use of my time
03:19:24.80 --> 03:19:28.96 like the outcome of the primary seemed somewhat inevitable at that point and
03:19:29.84 --> 03:19:34.64 the most effective use of my time would be to focus on how I could best help with the response
03:19:34.64 --> 03:19:40.32 on of COVID and Hawaii and you know I was calling trying to get like and 95 masks and just trying
03:19:40.32 --> 03:19:46.64 to help with that local response in Hawaii so you what it's called dropping out of the races
03:19:46.64 --> 03:19:51.20 what it's called there's some official word for yeah no with Drew my Canada's I grew with
03:19:51.20 --> 03:19:57.60 Canada so you withdrew suspending that's the word they use suspending your Canada's you
03:19:57.60 --> 03:20:06.08 and did you feel like what the hell just happened did you feel like wasted time did you feel like
03:20:06.08 --> 03:20:12.96 man because again I remember looking at you in the polls and you know you might have gotten to
03:20:12.96 --> 03:20:20.16 3% or 4% I could I was really surprised I was really surprised you know that you just didn't
03:20:20.16 --> 03:20:27.92 get the kind of traction again as as Joe said you're like such a kind of ideal candidate from
03:20:28.96 --> 03:20:35.84 like a box checking your a veteran your a woman you've been you've got experience you got
03:20:35.84 --> 03:20:43.92 combat deployments you're whatever not a white person you got these things that people are looking
03:20:43.92 --> 03:20:50.40 for hoppa yeah you're hopper so you got those things and it just seemed like okay
03:20:51.44 --> 03:20:55.68 it'll be interesting to watch this she's gonna climb right up this thing and you never really made
03:20:55.68 --> 03:21:05.52 that progress does that surprise you I mean in hindsight no because you because you see
03:21:05.52 --> 03:21:13.36 that you had that at that moment like going through it it surprised me that I didn't even
03:21:13.36 --> 03:21:20.24 have the opportunity to earn it to earn the support to get that exposure however you tell me at
03:21:20.24 --> 03:21:24.32 some point you were like the number one most googled name after the first debate after the second
03:21:24.32 --> 03:21:29.28 debate what you you didn't make the third debate for whatever reason yeah I don't remember which you
03:21:29.28 --> 03:21:34.24 know I I think there was there was yeah there was a gap at some point where I didn't make one
03:21:34.24 --> 03:21:39.84 but then I made the the next I don't remember exactly what but in those first in those first debates
03:21:40.88 --> 03:21:46.40 I was the most searched candidate of the night after each of those debates which was the whole point
03:21:47.20 --> 03:21:51.92 you know hey I can go on this stage the national stage and the first debate I think had over
03:21:51.92 --> 03:21:57.76 20 million viewers and this is the opportunity to introduce myself to the American people
03:21:59.36 --> 03:22:03.68 and the hopes that they might say hmm she looks interesting I want to know more I want to learn
03:22:03.68 --> 03:22:09.68 more and that being starting to kind of crack open the door to be able to make an impact there
03:22:11.04 --> 03:22:15.76 I think one of the other in addition to all the things that we talked about about how
03:22:17.36 --> 03:22:22.16 that opportunity really ultimately did not exist and it started with that first debate
03:22:23.44 --> 03:22:30.000 you know in advance we had set up our our Google ads account so that when people went on
03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:35.52 Google and said hey who is Tulsi Gabbard then you know our links would pop up and they would
03:22:35.52 --> 03:22:40.88 then go to my website and they could look at click issue x-yersy what do you care about biobaccount
03:22:40.88 --> 03:22:47.28 et cetera um that was the hope that that would be I would be the most Google candidate and that
03:22:47.28 --> 03:22:55.76 we therefore ready for it um Google shut down our Google ads account with no reason whatsoever
03:22:55.76 --> 03:23:01.84 at all given during the first debate it was not actually during the debate it was afterward
03:23:02.64 --> 03:23:09.28 but it was during that it was during that window of time that was the golden opportunity
03:23:09.92 --> 03:23:18.16 to capture and it was a limited window and they they just like your your count is suspended no
03:23:18.16 --> 03:23:25.92 explanation no here's what you got to do to fix it or get it you know whatever released and uh and
03:23:25.92 --> 03:23:30.48 to this day we've never gotten you know it was suspended for a certain period of time and then
03:23:30.48 --> 03:23:36.96 it was reinstated and it was not for lack of us trying to reach anybody who would answer us and tell
03:23:36.96 --> 03:23:43.76 us why and what we could do to fix it immediately so you know I mean there's I found a loss
03:23:43.76 --> 03:23:50.16 to get in this Google for that um because of because of the the impact obviously that it had on
03:23:50.16 --> 03:23:55.04 me but also but really the bigger issue that I I wanted to raise by filing this lawsuit was
03:23:55.84 --> 03:24:06.40 you've got this massive big tech company who has the power to um interfere in the public
03:24:06.40 --> 03:24:13.12 square of our democracy and you know who knows still to this day like was it some guy sitting at a
03:24:13.12 --> 03:24:17.60 computer was like man fuck tells you gathered I'm gonna punch this button and show her what's
03:24:17.60 --> 03:24:25.04 up or like who knows I don't know what happened but it happened and if it can happen to a sitting
03:24:25.04 --> 03:24:31.04 member of Congress who's running for the highest office in the land it could happen to anybody
03:24:31.76 --> 03:24:37.76 running for office anybody who's speaking out anybody being critical of whether it's big tech or
03:24:37.76 --> 03:24:43.44 government policy like whatever the motive um this is the power that they have in their hands that's
03:24:43.44 --> 03:24:52.96 incredibly dangerous in undermining the the kind of core pillars of our democracy of a having a
03:24:52.96 --> 03:24:59.12 marketplace of free ideas and voters who can you know get the information they need and ultimately
03:24:59.12 --> 03:25:08.88 make the decision that they want to make are they allowed to are they allowed to mess with like
03:25:08.88 --> 03:25:13.20 Google ad words from a political perspective so I know the words if I was running against you
03:25:13.20 --> 03:25:21.04 and I bought the ad word Tulsi Gabbard and brought it to a freaking Russian newspaper article about how
03:25:21.04 --> 03:25:25.44 they're your favorite so when I Google Tulsi Gabbard I click on the first article that comes
03:25:25.44 --> 03:25:31.20 up it shows me that you're a Russian plant can I do that in the political realm because look they do it
03:25:31.20 --> 03:25:36.72 with like I you know I I have a bunch of companies and sell a bunch of stuff and you type in
03:25:37.44 --> 03:25:44.56 jocco you know the other companies pay for that word for jocco protein and it brings to their site
03:25:45.44 --> 03:25:50.08 so if I was a billionaire and you were running against me I could be like oh cool I'll just buy
03:25:50.08 --> 03:25:54.08 Tulsi Gabbard who is Tulsi Gabbard what is Tulsi Gabbard where is Tulsi Gabbard come from and I'll
03:25:54.08 --> 03:25:58.80 just buy all those things and send them all to Tulsi Gabbard from Russia what ever else I'm going to
03:25:58.80 --> 03:26:03.44 do is that legal in the political I know it's legal in the in the free market because they do it all the time
03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:10.56 is it legal in the political side too far as I know I am not I have not come across any kind of
03:26:12.08 --> 03:26:21.36 like legislation against ad words in Google there are there are no laws or rules in place
03:26:21.36 --> 03:26:30.80 from a government perspective that that limit what these big tech monopolies can do with their
03:26:30.80 --> 03:26:40.64 algorithms and that's part of the whole issue here when we talk about big tech the monopolies the
03:26:40.64 --> 03:26:48.72 power that they have to either promote or push forward certain voices or people or ideas and
03:26:48.72 --> 03:26:58.000 silence others and they can do so while being completely legally immune from any kind of
03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:02.72 accountability through our legal system because they're private companies well because
03:27:02.72 --> 03:27:08.32 yet because they're private companies but this section to 30 provision that exists within the law
03:27:08.32 --> 03:27:19.12 that was was put in place to encourage innovation on the internet early you know decades ago when they
03:27:19.12 --> 03:27:29.36 pass that law it that gave them this legal immunity it said that they can they can remove content that
03:27:29.36 --> 03:27:37.12 they deem to be objectionable without any definition of what that is first of all whatever they want it to
03:27:37.12 --> 03:27:45.44 be whatever they want it to be and then it says whether or not it is protected by the constitution
03:27:46.72 --> 03:27:56.40 dang how I don't know who wrote that part of it probably the same to bastard that clicked
03:27:56.40 --> 03:28:03.60 delete under freaking account for six hours but to have something in there that says you internet you
03:28:03.60 --> 03:28:12.08 know service provider company you can decide what speech you deem or content objectionable or not
03:28:12.08 --> 03:28:19.60 whether or not it is protected by our constitution this is the problem that needs to be fixed within
03:28:19.60 --> 03:28:25.20 our laws today as it relates to big tech and it's a relatively there's a lot of I even I've looked
03:28:25.20 --> 03:28:30.88 at this a lot while I was in Congress and then after for obvious reasons and you know there's a lot
03:28:30.88 --> 03:28:36.40 of different proposals in different ways to kind of bite this apple but the most simple and direct way
03:28:36.40 --> 03:28:47.04 would be to take out that objectionable content just take those words out and instead you know
03:28:48.72 --> 03:28:55.20 you can say unless it is you know you you can remove content unless it is protected under the
03:28:55.20 --> 03:29:01.76 first amendment and there's legal precedence in place through various Supreme Court rulings
03:29:01.76 --> 03:29:09.92 that provide very clear kind of guardrails towards what kind of speeches protected versus what is
03:29:09.92 --> 03:29:16.72 not and that way if if we make this legislative change it would alleviate the kind of pressure that
03:29:16.72 --> 03:29:22.16 these big tech companies are under right now coming from the left and the right because then they
03:29:22.16 --> 03:29:28.48 can just say look these are the guardrails this is speech that's protected and it's going to remain
03:29:28.48 --> 03:29:35.28 on the internet and speech that's not protected then it's up to us to make that decision to to
03:29:35.28 --> 03:29:40.40 to remove it that that's that's the that that's the that's the best answer that I have come across
03:29:40.40 --> 03:29:47.52 on how to address this rather than allowing this you know I mean now we have like okay
03:29:47.52 --> 03:29:50.56 well we're going to cancel anything that's disinformation we're going to cancel anything that's
03:29:50.56 --> 03:29:57.84 misinformation we're going to you know cancel anything that we don't like or you know I mean it's
03:29:57.84 --> 03:30:03.04 it's getting worse and worse and unfortunately the direction that I'm seeing from Democrats in Congress
03:30:03.04 --> 03:30:11.44 is not towards how do we protect free speech but instead it's we need big tech to do more
03:30:11.44 --> 03:30:21.60 to shut people up who are saying things that we deem to be misinformation or disinformation or
03:30:21.60 --> 03:30:30.32 that could mislead people into believing a certain thing or seeing a certain view and it's it is
03:30:32.08 --> 03:30:38.48 you know the fact that this is happening and people don't see the danger of okay you're in power
03:30:38.48 --> 03:30:46.16 today you got Kevin McCarthy who's the head of the Republicans in the house saying I bet my house
03:30:46.88 --> 03:30:51.28 on the fact that Republicans will regain the majority in 2022 what are you going to do in the
03:30:51.28 --> 03:30:56.16 tables turn and then you've got the other guys in power saying yeah you know what we don't want
03:30:56.16 --> 03:31:02.24 Democrats to be misleading people on the internet so we're going to tweak the language a little bit
03:31:02.24 --> 03:31:10.48 and make sure that big tech silences those voices and pushes like it's it's so simple and clear
03:31:11.20 --> 03:31:18.48 how dangerous of position that we are in and that when you when you threaten the first amendment
03:31:18.48 --> 03:31:26.80 like freedom of speech a free press like freedom of religion once you undermine that what do we have
03:31:26.80 --> 03:31:34.16 in America we don't we don't have we don't have the country we don't have our country
03:31:35.28 --> 03:31:42.000 yeah we did the we did a podcast and we recorded it before Christmas but we did it on 1984
03:31:42.000 --> 03:31:45.76 I listened to that yeah and it was really weird because we just you know it's just something
03:31:45.76 --> 03:31:50.000 that I was like all the same things that are going on and I and I you know read that book many
03:31:50.000 --> 03:31:55.28 many years ago and I remembered this one part of this about the language and the importance of
03:31:55.28 --> 03:31:59.92 language and they did therefore the importance of free speech and we recorded it and then like it was
03:31:59.92 --> 03:32:08.56 Christmas time and that that podcast came out January 6th and it was kind of crazy that it came out
03:32:08.56 --> 03:32:12.96 on that just we had recorded it a month prior and you had scheduled it for that it was just that's
03:32:12.96 --> 03:32:21.04 when it's coming out so it came out January 6 then 1984 was trending and then then the tag the hashtag
03:32:21.04 --> 03:32:30.56 1984 some some hashtag 1984 actually got shut down on Twitter it was it wasn't because of that podcast
03:32:30.56 --> 03:32:35.20 but it was just very coincidental that all that was happening at the same time but
03:32:36.40 --> 03:32:41.36 the point of doing that podcast and this is exactly aligned with what you're saying you have to
03:32:41.36 --> 03:32:47.12 allow people to communicate with each other and you know saying if you if you say something
03:32:47.12 --> 03:32:52.08 to me that's misleading I can't just it's what I started off with I just don't say shut up you're
03:32:52.08 --> 03:32:55.84 not allowed to talk I say okay well actually told me let me show you some other information
03:32:55.84 --> 03:32:59.76 that might change your mind a little bit because by the way when I just tell you to shut up
03:33:00.64 --> 03:33:06.40 I don't move your opinion at all in fact there's a really good chance that I'm just going to make
03:33:06.40 --> 03:33:11.44 you you don't stop on that and that's what's happening in the country and now which is freaking
03:33:11.44 --> 03:33:18.96 nasty and and and and actually that again interestingly as all this was happening we had had
03:33:18.96 --> 03:33:24.000 I talked to echo I was like listen man I don't know what's going to happen in the world and I don't
03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:29.52 know what's going to happen look we don't we're not on here making any inflammatory statements
03:33:29.52 --> 03:33:33.52 we're usually talking about history I said and that's cool will what that's what we're going to do
03:33:34.40 --> 03:33:37.44 but at some point people are starting to change history and I said I don't know what's going to
03:33:37.44 --> 03:33:42.48 even happen with the platforms that were on yeah like these platforms could change the way they
03:33:42.48 --> 03:33:47.36 do business and we started our own platform just to make sure we have someplace to
03:33:48.32 --> 03:33:53.92 someplace to go in the event that things take a turn for the worse and there's a bunch of other
03:33:53.92 --> 03:33:57.20 things that could happen I mean you could have some of these free platform say we're going to
03:33:57.20 --> 03:34:02.40 start charging money and start inserting ads into the middle of you know here's Jaco talking about a
03:34:02.40 --> 03:34:09.84 battle in World War II and it's heavy and crazy and emotional and some someone's going to
03:34:09.84 --> 03:34:14.24 start an ad in there like I don't want that I don't want people to have to put up with that
03:34:15.44 --> 03:34:21.52 so I don't know or do we just get someone to say look hey Jaco you talked about this part of
03:34:21.52 --> 03:34:26.48 history which you know we don't really like we think it's misinformation and pull it down
03:34:26.48 --> 03:34:33.12 that's that's a reality that could happen yeah so we have to be what did that's why we made
03:34:33.12 --> 03:34:39.04 that we made the the Jaco underground just because of that so that's the platform that you guys
03:34:39.04 --> 03:34:43.84 create it's the platform that Jaco underground calm and it's just a backup and look
03:34:43.84 --> 03:34:48.24 somebody like oh you want money I was like no we don't want your money yeah that's not what it's about
03:34:48.80 --> 03:34:56.32 but to not have a contingency plan is ignorant and so and again all that what's
03:34:56.32 --> 03:34:59.76 funny about all this is I had talked to echo about it he's kind of he said hey can you build
03:34:59.76 --> 03:35:03.68 something figure this out and he's you know working and figuring it out and eventually goes yeah
03:35:03.68 --> 03:35:08.96 you know I got it and this was before the end of 2020 this is before the end of 2020 it was a
03:35:08.96 --> 03:35:14.24 let's have a contingency plan in case something happens right and then I said you know what
03:35:14.80 --> 03:35:20.72 this is getting squirrely it's getting squirrely let's launch the contingency plan you know next month
03:35:20.72 --> 03:35:25.20 just to just to get it out there so people know what it is in case something happens and sure enough
03:35:25.20 --> 03:35:32.96 January 6 it was like boom we had it it was so coincidental but it was very it was like and I
03:35:32.96 --> 03:35:37.68 remember texting echo like well I guess this is why we had a contingency plan and then thank God
03:35:37.68 --> 03:35:43.12 it launched today because who knows where it's going to be in six months I don't know I don't know
03:35:44.16 --> 03:35:52.000 it's crazy I remember listening to that night so I don't I have not listened like I have friends
03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:58.08 of mine who have listened to your podcast from number one and then those people in my friends too
03:35:58.08 --> 03:36:06.72 yeah but like in in sequence like chronologically and like a buddy of mine got to the the
03:36:07.52 --> 03:36:13.52 I think it was episode 99 is Musashi 100 100 well he couldn't get past 99 because he didn't
03:36:13.52 --> 03:36:18.64 finish reading the book and I'm like hey Jocco just did this new show on's and I can't do it
03:36:18.64 --> 03:36:26.56 because I can't listen to 100 until I read the book so yeah I'm not one of those people
03:36:26.56 --> 03:36:34.88 I'll jump around I'll jump around like okay what am I in the mood like what am I in the mood for
03:36:34.88 --> 03:36:40.88 wait am I in the mood for dark depressive war am I in the mood for human atrocity where am I
03:36:40.88 --> 03:36:48.80 and I'll tell you a funny story about that in a second but I went straight for that 1984 and I don't
03:36:48.80 --> 03:36:55.20 remember what actual day it was not January 6 but it was in the days after and I I wondered then
03:36:56.32 --> 03:37:03.28 it when you had recorded that because it was literally addressing everything that we were seeing
03:37:03.28 --> 03:37:09.84 play out right right before us as far as the warning signs and the dangers of this is where
03:37:09.84 --> 03:37:20.32 this is where you end up once you allow for this kind of control and once we as people accept it
03:37:23.36 --> 03:37:30.24 but little sidetrack funny story and I'll show you the video after because we'll take me
03:37:30.24 --> 03:37:35.12 a minute to dig it up but it won't surprise you to know that on the presidential campaign trail
03:37:35.12 --> 03:37:42.000 sleep was hard to come by for me and for two reasons one was just a factor of time in the day but
03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:52.32 also it was tough for me to um tough for me to turn turn everything off and actually just get like
03:37:52.32 --> 03:37:56.96 I'm not even talking about hours I'm just talking about just some a good slice of good quality
03:37:56.96 --> 03:38:05.20 rest in sleep um we were in New Hampshire in the middle of winter and there was a rare opportunity
03:38:05.20 --> 03:38:11.92 where I got to take a nap and we'd like rented a like an Airbnb or something like that and um
03:38:11.92 --> 03:38:19.20 so I took a nap and my husband took a video of me taking a nap because he walked in the room
03:38:19.20 --> 03:38:24.64 and I'm lying there and I'm asleep and I'm all bundled up under the covers and I got my phone
03:38:24.64 --> 03:38:33.68 sitting on my um on the top of the covers and I was listening to jaccopodcast with a guy from the
03:38:33.68 --> 03:38:43.68 French foreign legion and I'll show you the video because I am dead asleep and uh my husband came
03:38:43.68 --> 03:38:49.84 and he has the camera going picks up my phone looks at and the reason I remember this is because
03:38:49.84 --> 03:38:57.60 this was on February 11th, February 11th, 2020 and it just so happened that it popped up on my phone
03:38:57.60 --> 03:39:03.76 on February 11th of this year as like the memory thing or whatever and I was debating sending it to you
03:39:03.76 --> 03:39:09.36 and I told my husband I was like we didn't get the wrong idea and think I'm like boarded at
03:39:09.36 --> 03:39:17.12 the spotcast and he's like no what it showed was like I was able to completely tune out the noise of
03:39:17.12 --> 03:39:23.36 of what was going on in my mind of the day to day and and be able to kind of be transported to a
03:39:23.36 --> 03:39:29.36 different conversation and topic and and all this other stuff but it was a great podcast that I
03:39:29.36 --> 03:39:36.72 did end up finishing but you gave me the gift of some really good sleep as well. The soothing
03:39:36.72 --> 03:39:42.64 place of jaccopod talking about war can send anyone to sleep. I don't know what that says about me
03:39:42.64 --> 03:39:53.44 you're a little too serious. Anyhow. I remember when you dropped out of the race and you
03:39:55.28 --> 03:40:00.16 endorsed Biden and I remember thinking because again I didn't know a lot of these things that
03:40:00.16 --> 03:40:06.64 you're telling me right now I knew them kind of but I still I still had some sort of naive sense in my
03:40:06.64 --> 03:40:11.76 heart that it can't be that bad and I I texted you and I said like hey are you gonna get the VP
03:40:11.76 --> 03:40:16.32 nodded because I was kind of surprised you endorsed Biden I was like well you know what oh I said oh I
03:40:16.32 --> 03:40:20.96 know what's happening she's playing the game she's gonna endorse Biden Biden's gonna get her as
03:40:20.96 --> 03:40:27.84 the VP it's on and you were like you like you like however you laugh and text you were like hey
03:40:27.84 --> 03:40:33.92 bro you're a little bit uh you're a little bit lost there. I did nothing from these people. I was like oh
03:40:33.92 --> 03:40:45.36 okay that's how. Pretty much pretty much. And then so so then you wrapped up your your career
03:40:45.84 --> 03:40:52.80 well you wrapped up this portion of your career as a politician in in that was it. We went out to DC
03:40:52.80 --> 03:40:59.44 for the last congressional session. Yeah. Packed up your locker. And you were a second was my last official
03:40:59.44 --> 03:41:07.04 day. We had to pack up the office before Thanksgiving. So uh no kidding you know we were there obviously
03:41:07.04 --> 03:41:12.80 votes going into December there was you know government's gonna shut down if we don't pass a new
03:41:12.80 --> 03:41:18.000 appropriations bill and kind of the unfortunate usual thing that happens at the end of every year.
03:41:19.52 --> 03:41:24.24 But yeah I was working out of my car like parked in front of the capital I had my computer and
03:41:24.24 --> 03:41:31.68 it's COVID so you know votes consist of seven different groups of members of Congress. I was
03:41:31.68 --> 03:41:36.24 group two. It's by alphabetical order where you were only allowed to have a certain number of people
03:41:36.24 --> 03:41:42.40 on the floor at any given time. They decontaminate the whole floor between every vote. And so when
03:41:42.40 --> 03:41:48.32 your group is called you go in cash your vote and then you leave. And so that was like a park my
03:41:48.32 --> 03:41:53.04 guy votes are called sometimes they last for you know an hour or two hours or whatever and
03:41:53.04 --> 03:41:58.56 if you've got four votes in a series then you're doing this running in and out you know four times
03:41:58.56 --> 03:42:03.44 in that series and so yeah I was you know office office shut down before Thanksgiving had to turn
03:42:03.44 --> 03:42:09.12 in everything so that they could transition and start to bring in other members of Congress and I should
03:42:09.12 --> 03:42:17.84 mention now that that I made the decision not to run for reelection to my house seat in October of
03:42:17.84 --> 03:42:27.60 2019 when it got to the point where I had to make a decision where I would either continue my
03:42:27.60 --> 03:42:33.52 candidacy or I would suspend my presidential campaign and focus on running for reelection in Hawaii
03:42:33.52 --> 03:42:41.76 and I couldn't do both. Legally I could have but just the constraints of time and the tyranny of
03:42:41.76 --> 03:42:48.40 distance it was not I was I would end up doing a crappy job at both so that was the decision I made
03:42:48.40 --> 03:42:55.04 I you know let folks in and I wanted people in Hawaii to know that you know they were not some kind
03:42:55.04 --> 03:42:59.36 of fallback plan for me if this national thing didn't work out and that they would have the
03:42:59.36 --> 03:43:04.72 opportunity and the time to decide who they would want you know to to work for them and other
03:43:04.72 --> 03:43:13.04 candidates who who who were going to run so and that was a decision I never looked back on or regretted
03:43:13.04 --> 03:43:19.04 in any way but as a result of that yeah so things started quickly and having to shut down in DC
03:43:19.76 --> 03:43:28.000 but January 2nd was was the actual final day. Were you heading home kind of stoked
03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:35.12 that it was over or were you heading home kind of bummed out that it was over. Mixed feelings really
03:43:35.12 --> 03:43:41.36 mixed feelings again I made that decision without regret and so it wasn't any surprise that this
03:43:41.36 --> 03:43:48.48 was going to happen at this point in time but I mean I remember landing at Dolace Airport and
03:43:49.68 --> 03:43:56.96 on that last trip and as I was driving into DC like I'm not going to make this drive again
03:43:56.96 --> 03:44:05.28 as a member of Congress at least and even as screwed up as things are and as frustrating as things
03:44:05.28 --> 03:44:15.60 are and have progressively gotten it never takes away the awesomeness of that privilege of being able
03:44:15.60 --> 03:44:21.76 to serve in that in that way and you know there there are grooves have you have you been inside
03:44:21.76 --> 03:44:31.84 the state capital before the US capital when you go inside there are you know marble steps
03:44:31.84 --> 03:44:36.48 that take you up to the actual entrance to the house floor then the second floor and then the
03:44:36.48 --> 03:44:41.92 visitors gather on the third floor when you walk those steps there are there deeply worn grooves
03:44:43.04 --> 03:44:49.04 where countless other leaders from our nation's history have walked those very steps
03:44:49.04 --> 03:45:03.12 and the the it's an amazing thing to never forget those who have come before us those who will
03:45:03.12 --> 03:45:10.48 come after and how special of a privilege it is that the people of Hawaii allowed me that
03:45:10.48 --> 03:45:16.88 privilege to do my best to serve them for the eight years that I was there and that was that was you
03:45:16.88 --> 03:45:23.52 know yeah I there's so much of the political drama and just the theatrics and the
03:45:25.12 --> 03:45:30.40 all of the stuff that you just kind of got of endure in order to try to do the work that you're
03:45:30.40 --> 03:45:36.08 trying to do and and I always hated all that stuff and I know no problem at all leaving that
03:45:37.12 --> 03:45:42.32 that behind but I think the the mixed feelings and emotions part just came from
03:45:42.32 --> 03:45:48.64 just that that reflecting on the time that I've had there and honestly wishing that there
03:45:48.64 --> 03:45:51.52 there are a lot of areas and things that I wish I could have done more on that I could have
03:45:52.48 --> 03:45:58.88 you know legislation that I wish had been able to advance farther or you know it's just
03:45:58.88 --> 03:46:03.60 different things you know assessing kind of what I was able to do what I wish I was able to do and
03:46:03.60 --> 03:46:16.32 but but leaving with the sense of of peace in my heart and in knowing that you know I did my best
03:46:17.12 --> 03:46:23.84 and excited about how I can find how I will find a way to continue to serve.
03:46:23.84 --> 03:46:33.84 So you get back home to Hawaii and I know when I came back from my last deployment to Iraq
03:46:33.84 --> 03:46:42.000 I had home for I was home for like a month and one day I just like woke up on a Saturday and I kind
03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:52.64 of felt like this weird weight I felt good right I felt good and I felt like the weight was
03:46:52.64 --> 03:46:57.52 gone and I was kind of thinking about what what what why do I feel so good right now and I realized oh
03:46:58.96 --> 03:47:02.80 it's because I'm not worried about one my guys getting wounded or killed right now because we're
03:47:02.80 --> 03:47:06.88 home from deployment and it took me about a month for that to go away because it's just your
03:47:06.88 --> 03:47:13.36 instinct every time you wake up you're thinking about what's happening is everyone okay you're
03:47:13.36 --> 03:47:16.80 thinking about that all the time and I never noticed it when I was on deployment because that's just
03:47:16.80 --> 03:47:20.48 how it was it was just you know you just wake up and that's what you're thinking and it's real
03:47:20.48 --> 03:47:24.32 well after a month of waking up and oh no it's not you don't have to worry about the oh no you
03:47:24.32 --> 03:47:27.28 don't have to worry about that and eventually one day I woke up and said why don't feel so
03:47:27.28 --> 03:47:30.16 oh it's because I'm not worried about that thing I've been worried about for so long
03:47:31.92 --> 03:47:37.36 when you got home I mean the how long did it take for that to wear off the pressure the
03:47:37.36 --> 03:47:42.80 the constantly thinking about all this crap that's going on and what you need to do and where
03:47:42.80 --> 03:47:45.84 you need to move and what's the next maneuver and who's mad at you and who's happy with you
03:47:45.84 --> 03:47:51.04 and all this other crap how long did it take you for for you like oh I hope I don't wait
03:47:51.84 --> 03:47:57.52 do I have wax for my surfboard right now how long did that take not very well
03:47:58.80 --> 03:48:06.32 I was ready man but it also you know I mean just this whole COVID situation also
03:48:08.16 --> 03:48:13.12 you know I had been home a lot more than I normally would have been and working from home
03:48:13.12 --> 03:48:18.16 and having virtual committee hearings and and a lot of other stuff that was just it was a
03:48:18.16 --> 03:48:26.96 strange lead up to where the contrast wasn't so different but it was it was odd for me like
03:48:26.96 --> 03:48:32.000 it started August is when our primary elections are in Hawaii and I remember waking up on primary
03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:38.80 election day which is Saturday and Hawaii and I was like oh my gosh I don't have to go sign
03:48:38.80 --> 03:48:46.40 waving at six o'clock in the morning I can I can go surfing like this is a weird feeling
03:48:47.04 --> 03:48:52.40 because I had held elected office for the previous 10 years I'd been on a ballot every single
03:48:52.40 --> 03:48:58.56 election for the previous 10 years and so that was that was strange that was a really weird
03:48:58.56 --> 03:49:06.16 thing that was felt unnatural to me and then you know similarly with with the general election
03:49:06.16 --> 03:49:19.52 but yeah I was I had no issue with that transition and yeah went on just to take full advantage
03:49:20.24 --> 03:49:31.28 of being home and knowing that really a lot of it was being able to regain control over
03:49:31.28 --> 03:49:44.16 how I spent my time and have to to no longer have those very immediate political factors
03:49:44.16 --> 03:49:55.44 playing into decisions that I'm making and just to just to be for the first time and a long time
03:49:55.44 --> 03:50:00.64 not have not been constantly jet lag that was something I didn't realize took such a toll for
03:50:01.36 --> 03:50:05.68 eight years I'm going back and forth two or three times a month between Hawaii and DC five or six
03:50:05.68 --> 03:50:10.72 hours difference every time plane rides are long with that was not nice whatever I can it's playing
03:50:10.72 --> 03:50:18.88 ride but you know like like I can actually like get a schedule happening and stick with it
03:50:18.88 --> 03:50:24.80 and not be up at two o'clock in the morning because it's eight in DC and then you know go to sleep at
03:50:24.80 --> 03:50:29.36 six because it's midnight I guess just you know it was just just basic like simple life things
03:50:29.76 --> 03:50:34.72 like I like to cook like I could actually like hey like I can go grocery shopping and cooking and
03:50:34.72 --> 03:50:38.88 not have to worry like is the food gonna rot by the time I have to leave and then come back it's just
03:50:38.88 --> 03:50:46.40 like simple little things it's it's nice so let's get into what you're settling into now
03:50:46.40 --> 03:50:54.32 the dust is settled and you're able to buy groceries cook them before they rock you're able to
03:50:54.32 --> 03:51:01.52 serve train get on a schedule but obviously that's not what you're gonna do for the rest of your life
03:51:01.92 --> 03:51:09.20 yeah what else is going on what else you got going on in the world so I am so I'm still serving in the
03:51:09.20 --> 03:51:18.72 Army reserves I have I move from the National Guard to the reserves and transition my branch to civil affairs
03:51:18.72 --> 03:51:32.48 awesome which is often called kind of the the warrior diplomat service and yeah it's it's fantastic I
03:51:32.48 --> 03:51:38.96 am it's it's been a great move and one that's focused on building relationships and kind of kind of
03:51:38.96 --> 03:51:42.56 write my life something I've been interested for a long time that that I never pursued because
03:51:42.56 --> 03:51:47.68 it doesn't exist within the National Guard for obvious reasons it's a National Guard focuses domestic
03:51:47.68 --> 03:51:56.32 mission first but civil affairs is 98% of civil affairs forces in the United States Army live
03:51:56.32 --> 03:52:05.76 within the Army reserves there's the remaining whatever 2% is basically lives on on Fort Bragg as
03:52:05.76 --> 03:52:14.72 part of the the unconventional special forces community and so yeah I'm appreciating the training
03:52:14.72 --> 03:52:18.64 the experience and also some of the missions that that have already been able to serve on there
03:52:18.64 --> 03:52:27.84 I as as kind of a direct result of everything that we talked about with my experience with the
03:52:27.84 --> 03:52:36.80 the mainstream media and being filtered into you know or limited to soundbites
03:52:37.92 --> 03:52:43.76 there I'm willing us to go in depth or even really cover any real issues serious issues and just
03:52:43.76 --> 03:52:51.20 the caricatures that they they create I am launching my own show where I will have the opportunity to
03:52:52.96 --> 03:53:01.28 really speak directly to people in an unfiltered way and an unlimited way both both about a lot
03:53:01.28 --> 03:53:04.80 you know some of these issues that we've talked about and and have conversations with people who can
03:53:04.80 --> 03:53:10.88 shed light and bring their expertise or experience on them but also just be able to
03:53:10.88 --> 03:53:18.40 have a platform where I can take some of those experiences that I've had and I'm sure you've
03:53:18.40 --> 03:53:23.12 had the same because I've seen it in the military I've seen it in politics where whether it's
03:53:23.12 --> 03:53:27.04 traveling to different parts of the country or traveling to different parts of the world
03:53:28.24 --> 03:53:38.48 there's there's so much more that we have in common as people than is often focused on or
03:53:38.48 --> 03:53:44.64 that we even we may may realize and so I look forward to being able to have that platform my show is
03:53:44.64 --> 03:53:54.32 called this is Tulsi Gabbard just because it is just me and and use that as as an opportunity to be
03:53:54.32 --> 03:54:05.04 able to fill that gap or or to provide what the mainstream media and the corporate media is not offering
03:54:05.04 --> 03:54:11.60 to people and and that I found there's there is there's a lot of hunger for that for real
03:54:11.60 --> 03:54:16.56 conversation whether it's with people you agree with or or to have a dialogue you know I I want
03:54:16.56 --> 03:54:21.68 to be able to have people on my show who represent different views on an issue and who are interested
03:54:21.68 --> 03:54:26.88 in having a respectful conversation about it and why you hold one view why do you hold the other view
03:54:27.60 --> 03:54:32.96 where is their common ground where is their irretractable differences where where do you draw the line
03:54:32.96 --> 03:54:43.20 and and I think being able to provide this platform I hope will result in more people thinking like
03:54:43.20 --> 03:54:49.44 hey maybe I can start talking to my neighbor who voted for the other guy or the other party and we
03:54:49.44 --> 03:54:54.72 haven't really talked for like a year because of it but maybe we should just like start the conversation
03:54:54.72 --> 03:55:01.76 and see where it goes and that it's okay and that we in America should be encouraging civil discourse
03:55:01.76 --> 03:55:10.40 and dialogue and encouraging when we talk about what we have to protect freedom of speech what is that
03:55:10.40 --> 03:55:20.80 mean well well you know and and how do you do it like let's start with speaking sharing our ideas
03:55:20.80 --> 03:55:27.04 and not as as you started this whole our conversation today not in a way that says I'm right
03:55:27.04 --> 03:55:34.64 you're wrong I have to be heard you don't get to be heard but in a way that that we don't see
03:55:34.64 --> 03:55:40.08 now where if if you believe in something you hold a view that you feel is important strong and
03:55:40.08 --> 03:55:46.88 and communicate that also recognize that not everyone may share that view for whatever reason
03:55:46.88 --> 03:55:51.44 maybe they have a different background a different experience and one that you may not have
03:55:51.44 --> 03:55:58.72 and that the more we can encourage this kind of exchange the stronger we are as a society
03:55:58.72 --> 03:56:08.32 and we don't lose by having a great platforms for people to share them and that that's the
03:56:08.32 --> 03:56:15.28 biggest difference between what we're seeing today versus what I believe our founders envisioned
03:56:15.28 --> 03:56:21.20 for us where somehow we've come to a place where the powerful people in this country think that
03:56:22.32 --> 03:56:29.20 it's it's really a sign of insecurity where if those who hold different views are allowed to
03:56:29.20 --> 03:56:39.68 air them then somehow you'll lose which means maybe you're not confident that what you're
03:56:39.68 --> 03:56:46.16 offering is going to quote unquote win or convince people that it is a superior idea yep
03:56:46.16 --> 03:56:52.000 it plays out leadership strategy and tactics I talk about this you know if you if I'm in charge
03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:56.48 and told you you say hey hey jocco I don't think we should do it like that and my responses
03:56:56.48 --> 03:57:02.16 shut up and do what I told you to do I don't look strong no I look weak yeah I look weak if I
03:57:02.16 --> 03:57:06.40 say well tell see how do you think we should do it and I listen to your idea and I incorporate
03:57:06.40 --> 03:57:10.96 some of your idea into the overall plan because you're able to convince me because you had a different
03:57:10.96 --> 03:57:15.92 perspective than I did you'll see you'll look at me and think oh I really like working with working
03:57:15.92 --> 03:57:21.28 for jocco I really like working with jocco because he's listening to what I'm saying and all of a
03:57:21.28 --> 03:57:26.000 sudden we're coming up with actual better solutions by the way it's not like it's oh I'm doing
03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:30.72 this to appease to all of you right now so she'll you know work hard for me no she's actually got
03:57:30.72 --> 03:57:34.80 a presentation to me that actually makes more sense we're going to use it yeah it's we're trying
03:57:34.80 --> 03:57:40.32 to get some more so this is a podcast your new your new show yeah it'll be you know available
03:57:40.32 --> 03:57:50.24 on all the podcast platforms or anything we're also doing video so I I I I talked to you some time
03:57:50.24 --> 03:57:56.40 ago and ask some questions about how you launch a podcast and such and one of the things you
03:57:56.40 --> 03:58:00.88 told me about was consistency is key both of you that's that's a control that's that's a control
03:58:00.88 --> 03:58:06.08 as a question I just echoed echo Charles's advice on that well the message was received and so
03:58:06.08 --> 03:58:13.12 what I'm doing is so so soon within within the next few weeks but I'm recording a number of
03:58:13.12 --> 03:58:18.48 shows to have in the bank to make sure that you know hey I got to go away training for a couple
03:58:18.48 --> 03:58:24.64 of weeks that we're not gonna we're not gonna skip a beat so how long is the show have you recorded
03:58:24.64 --> 03:58:29.84 somewhere I have yeah you know I there no real time limit but right now they're about not
03:58:29.84 --> 03:58:38.16 like hour and a half ish you're not going to go psycho four hours I'm not a follows to it but
03:58:38.16 --> 03:58:43.68 no no rules no rules and I think that's that's an old thing about it so is that the main focus
03:58:43.68 --> 03:58:49.36 of your effort right now it is yeah you're gonna launch this show and I think probably by the end
03:58:49.36 --> 03:58:56.88 of this month it's what I'm aiming for awesome so where can people find you people can find me at
03:58:56.88 --> 03:59:04.96 Tulsi Gabbard on all the social media platforms and also on my website Tulsi Gabbard.com
03:59:06.24 --> 03:59:10.24 there's there's a few different things that that I'm looking to do there updates and
03:59:10.24 --> 03:59:15.20 and information and I've moved it away from what it was traditionally which is a political campaign
03:59:15.20 --> 03:59:22.80 website and and really focusing more on how we can build communities and conversation
03:59:22.80 --> 03:59:27.36 uh in our in our society I don't care if you're Democrat we public an independent I don't
03:59:27.36 --> 03:59:32.48 care if you voted for Trump or voted for Hillary or whatever none none of that should matter
03:59:32.48 --> 03:59:42.88 as we come together to to rebuild bridges focused on how we collectively as Americans can
03:59:45.04 --> 03:59:48.40 work together for the future of our country
03:59:48.40 --> 04:00:01.76 legit echo channels yes that seems like a good place to wrap this this session maybe this a
04:00:01.76 --> 04:00:07.04 good place to wrap up this session sure Tulsi's obviously been charging hard for
04:00:07.60 --> 04:00:13.84 well since you were 16 years old as water woman which again we will be so real reskowing
04:00:13.84 --> 04:00:19.36 the net for that she's been on the path echo Charles and I'm thinking we should be on the path too
04:00:20.56 --> 04:00:26.32 what what suggestions do you have hey when you go to the grocery store people like stop
04:00:26.32 --> 04:00:31.60 you a lot still in Hawaii definitely how yeah they do that food land which is interesting because
04:00:31.60 --> 04:00:38.56 I say I know you you're water woman I don't know where those kids are now
04:00:38.56 --> 04:00:49.04 I do not remember you where's your cape yeah exactly it's still there it's the same
04:00:49.04 --> 04:00:57.04 down cape yeah on on koai like when you'd see the mayor yeah wherever you know star market for sure
04:00:57.04 --> 04:01:01.92 um yeah you know stop and be like hey you know so would imagine if someone had like something
04:01:01.92 --> 04:01:06.64 you know some thing they want to address they they wouldn't hesitate to stop because you're right
04:01:06.64 --> 04:01:12.80 there it happened most recently um I was out surfing the reef near the mokulu islands and
04:01:12.80 --> 04:01:19.04 the east side of oahu and the surf there only goes off like it's only really good when there's no
04:01:19.04 --> 04:01:24.000 wind and there's swell obviously and it's it's a long it's like three quarters of a mile
04:01:24.000 --> 04:01:29.92 paddle from shore out there but it happened most recently they're like usually it's like
04:01:29.92 --> 04:01:36.08 someone will paddle up be like where do I know you from and then and then like one
04:01:36.08 --> 04:01:40.48 thousand and then it eventually like oh yeah I am told oh my god that's what I thought and then
04:01:40.48 --> 04:01:44.88 word in the lineup travels pretty quickly and the last time I was just a couple of weeks ago
04:01:44.88 --> 04:01:50.64 the ways were really like they stayed out for four hours and um people just like hey don't see
04:01:51.36 --> 04:01:56.56 guys on stand up words looking down at me on my surboard and talking stories like oh what this
04:01:56.56 --> 04:02:02.64 is what it's so it's it's cool I like it yeah imagine so you go to sandy beach
04:02:02.64 --> 04:02:09.68 um I have been I generally stay away I don't want to threaten like my life by
04:02:09.68 --> 04:02:21.76 body search for a break do you oh yeah those are yeah yeah back in the day back in the
04:02:21.76 --> 04:02:29.60 day all right all right we work you know are we surfing yeah snowboarding
04:02:29.60 --> 04:02:37.84 snowboarding oh I skis snowboard but echo Charles has recently become highly engaged in snowboard
04:02:37.84 --> 04:02:46.40 shredding like it but we are working out and training for various things so
04:02:47.04 --> 04:02:51.68 I was pretty stoked when you were running and you'd put like um whatever videos of you do in
04:02:51.68 --> 04:02:59.04 squats yeah and I'm like come on don't growl can we get a couple percentage points of increase on
04:02:59.04 --> 04:03:05.12 just doing burpees I was given credit I was like yeah I kind of leave on leaning in your
04:03:05.12 --> 04:03:09.12 direction to see the new burpees it's all good in the polls yeah and that's all you say okay
04:03:09.12 --> 04:03:13.52 in the polls people watching that saying oh there's totally doing burpees hey let's at least throw
04:03:13.52 --> 04:03:20.96 a dog a bong right come on let me earn it with some burpees yeah thank you guys I didn't really
04:03:20.96 --> 04:03:28.000 see much burpees by Joe Biden or you mean yeah I didn't see Joe Biden doing any burpees yeah nobody else
04:03:28.000 --> 04:03:35.76 nobody really else kind of got on the the fitness kick yeah crazy all good nonetheless we're gonna
04:03:35.76 --> 04:03:41.36 stay on the path so through the path we may need supplementation I would suggest supplementation
04:03:41.36 --> 04:03:47.44 don't worry jocquest I believe in that it's true yeah history there you go so here you go you got
04:03:47.44 --> 04:03:53.52 joints that need attention sometimes especially when we get older we need younger is this the
04:03:53.52 --> 04:04:03.28 collective we it's far okay I'm not I'm not I'm not against it but for those of us who are you
04:04:03.28 --> 04:04:08.80 know we want to get something that helps in the routine supplementation for joints protein
04:04:09.52 --> 04:04:16.48 brain body all this stuff so what do we got joint warfare joints krill oil joints discipline and
04:04:16.48 --> 04:04:23.84 discipline go brain and body how does that discipline go go this this is good I this is the first
04:04:23.84 --> 04:04:32.08 time I'm trying the discipline go jocco pomer drink very good tasty very good no sugar in that yeah
04:04:32.08 --> 04:04:37.52 that's sweet with the monk friend see I use monk fruit like in my protein shakes and stuff like

04:04:43.44 --> 04:04:50.40 natural like healthy sweetener without like the carbs of like maple syrup for example yes who just made
04:04:50.40 --> 04:05:02.16 the the clip of the week which maple syrup is my my go like I would only eat pancakes to have maple
04:05:02.16 --> 04:05:08.56 syrup really but you know I can't did you get any maple syrup from peat up in of the main oh
04:05:08.56 --> 04:05:15.60 peat come on yeah he's out there and he used to do it himself but now you know it's just like
04:05:15.60 --> 04:05:21.04 friends and it's real maple syrup you can go up there oh man there's trees are running
04:05:21.04 --> 04:05:28.000 that was and sorry echo I'm messing with your jam here man but it's more than cool one of the coolest
04:05:28.000 --> 04:05:33.12 experiences well there were many but one of the coolest was when I stopped in freedom new hamper
04:05:33.12 --> 04:05:41.28 and went to a sugar shack met with the three generations of family who have passed down from
04:05:41.92 --> 04:05:49.92 you know father to child and got to see the whole thing we went up to the trees saw the taps
04:05:49.92 --> 04:05:56.56 came down saw the whole process and then of course like sampled the goods I like maple
04:05:56.56 --> 04:06:02.000 syrup is it ever since I've been a kid like those little maple leaf candies and you're done finished
04:06:02.000 --> 04:06:08.32 I was up in the main talking to Pete and he's like a sugar addict he obviously can't eat it that's
04:06:08.32 --> 04:06:13.84 why but he he was saying he would take little pencil box you know the pencil box you
04:06:13.84 --> 04:06:19.52 have when you're a little kid he would fill that with sugar cubes and hide it underneath his bed
04:06:19.52 --> 04:06:26.32 and at night when he'd go to bed he'd put like a little arca at it that's that's like level
04:06:26.32 --> 04:06:32.24 I'm like bro what is wrong with you and then he started like going into a different realm
04:06:32.24 --> 04:06:39.36 mental and he goes he goes bro if you ever tried you he's talking to me about yeah like crazy
04:06:39.36 --> 04:06:43.92 you were when were you were talking about that right unlike um I think yeah one of the origin
04:06:43.92 --> 04:06:49.36 videos can't be talking about that yes so it did sound crazy the way you were talking about but
04:06:49.36 --> 04:06:54.56 then I remember like we didn't just buy sugar cubes but every once in a while like you'd get
04:06:54.56 --> 04:07:00.16 the little pack right with all the sugar cubes and it and I eat those two they're like little candies
04:07:00.16 --> 04:07:04.64 yeah but it's like pure it's like main lining the sugar it's been a good I didn't hide
04:07:04.64 --> 04:07:10.08 them on my bed I was gonna say imagine it stealing those things from your own family
04:07:11.44 --> 04:07:16.96 putting a video it's like little cycle right that's different yeah well monk fruit no sugar
04:07:16.96 --> 04:07:21.68 exact that's not sure monk fruit is good stuff it's natural and by the way we went that distance
04:07:21.68 --> 04:07:26.88 and I held out wrong the other thing that's cool about this drink is which was really hard to do
04:07:26.88 --> 04:07:33.28 is the way that you make it stay good on the shelf is it has to you have to preserve it somehow
04:07:33.28 --> 04:07:37.12 and what no companies normally do is they just add chemicals to it right and they're called
04:07:37.12 --> 04:07:41.60 preservatives we've all heard of that right well instead of using preservatives which I didn't want
04:07:41.60 --> 04:07:48.32 to do it's it's pasteurized so it's like cooked so there's no but there's no chemicals in it but
04:07:48.32 --> 04:07:55.28 it costs us up ton of money to get it going and it took us an extra almost took us over six months
04:07:55.28 --> 04:07:59.84 to get this all set up but then we did it now you can drink this and your kids can drink it that's
04:07:59.84 --> 04:08:06.56 my own kids can drink my drink it's it's something that my my mom always encouraged us and it's
04:08:06.56 --> 04:08:11.12 like a habit I got into from a young age just like just read the ingredients before you buy it
04:08:11.76 --> 04:08:15.44 and if you don't understand half of the things that are on the ingredients then
04:08:15.44 --> 04:08:21.36 you know think twice about you know putting it in your body let me ask you if you understand these
04:08:21.36 --> 04:08:30.40 ingredients filtered carbonated water natural flavor citric acid monk fruit that's the ingredient list
04:08:32.16 --> 04:08:38.88 and it has the vitamin B6 and B12 it's got the other positive things but actual the food ingredients
04:08:38.88 --> 04:08:44.96 that's it that's incredible and more people are becoming conscious of this these things really I mean
04:08:44.96 --> 04:08:49.52 more people are becoming aware and whether it's because of health like diabetes and or whatever else
04:08:49.52 --> 04:08:54.48 but I think there's just an increased level of awareness of like hey and and even more so with COVID
04:08:54.48 --> 04:09:00.80 like I really should be healthy I should strengthen my immune system and I should know what I'm
04:09:01.28 --> 04:09:09.36 consuming I felt so bad the last time you visited so whatever three months ago something like that
04:09:09.36 --> 04:09:13.36 you came by we didn't have time to record I didn't have time to record or whatever but you just
04:09:13.36 --> 04:09:18.88 came by to hang out a little bit and whatever two days later I called you up and said hey
04:09:19.44 --> 04:09:24.64 hey or I sent you a text hey how you doing you're like fine I'm like got so detailed you
04:09:24.64 --> 04:09:33.60 you're like why I got COVID it's over that control yeah I had to make luckily I only saw
04:09:34.64 --> 04:09:40.80 the 10 people in that time period of whatever that week was where I knew I had well I had been
04:09:40.80 --> 04:09:51.76 tested positive for COVID taxidako he's like yeah I can't smell anything but it happens
04:09:53.76 --> 04:10:02.16 I'm just gonna knock on wood right now that yeah but yeah so there you go
04:10:03.04 --> 04:10:08.24 yeah you talk about the immunity thing yeah so come to the final jockel has that covered as well
04:10:08.24 --> 04:10:15.36 as far as supplementation goes vitamin D3 also the immunity and a special supplement called cold
04:10:15.36 --> 04:10:21.20 war it was good again this was crazy right like so I before COVID I traveled all the time
04:10:21.20 --> 04:10:25.20 all the time and you know the nightmare of that and you're breathing and everyone's stuff
04:10:25.92 --> 04:10:31.36 and so I said you know what I'm gonna make you know a good immunity booster with a bunch of
04:10:31.36 --> 04:10:36.24 vitamin C and just things that and so I made it and cool and we ended with selling good and whatever
04:10:36.24 --> 04:10:42.40 but then COVID hit and the tooth and I also made vitamin D already made it this isn't like oh
04:10:42.40 --> 04:10:47.20 it's COVID it was already in the system it was already it was already live because I only I take vitamin
04:10:47.20 --> 04:10:53.92 D and boom as soon as COVID hit it was like we could we had to just we sold out almost immediately
04:10:53.92 --> 04:10:57.44 and then we just had to ramp it up but luckily we had already had the formula's built so
04:10:57.44 --> 04:11:00.96 that stuff is awesome cold war and then and the vitamin D3
04:11:00.96 --> 04:11:08.16 it's true oh good for you yeah I mean I'm a I'm a supplement taker just in general but I was
04:11:08.16 --> 04:11:15.36 not taking vitamin D prior to COVID nor was I really aware of how important it was until I started
04:11:15.36 --> 04:11:22.08 to learn and read more and see especially related to COVID how most Americans are deficient
04:11:22.08 --> 04:11:27.92 yeah like vast majority of Americans are deficient in vitamin D and especially people who have
04:11:27.92 --> 04:11:36.000 any kind of you know colored tone to their skin even more so are found to be deficient in vitamin D
04:11:36.000 --> 04:11:44.000 so I am now a daily consumer well vitamin D yeah again I learned that when we had our daughter
04:11:44.000 --> 04:11:49.28 where everything in a reed for best development all this stuff vitamin D was always popping up
04:11:49.28 --> 04:11:55.28 with everything oh yeah vitamin D true but yeah so yeah got some get some vitamin D
04:11:55.28 --> 04:12:01.28 also don't forget about milk this is extra protein in the form of a dessert yeah by the way
04:12:01.28 --> 04:12:05.52 sometimes it's just dessert that has protein straight up straight up yeah especially if you get
04:12:05.52 --> 04:12:10.96 you little formula down like some people they just go milk milk milk milk on the milk whatever cool
04:12:10.96 --> 04:12:18.40 good but some of us we we have our perfectly tuned formula yeah half a spoon of peanut butter
04:12:18.40 --> 04:12:25.36 one scoop mint chocolate one scoop peanut butter chocolate one banana damn wow
04:12:25.36 --> 04:12:32.32 give milk or two percent milk boom that's the formula in my household I randomly tried almond milk
04:12:32.32 --> 04:12:41.12 with peanut butter milk bro yeah the gym what is up that's a freaking milkshake yeah
04:12:41.12 --> 04:12:46.88 that's a milkshake so that I added a banana like reluctantly like I was like okay banana
04:12:46.88 --> 04:12:52.24 because sometimes banana can jam up your whole flavor profile let me ask you this are they frozen
04:12:52.24 --> 04:12:57.20 or fresh both whatever because okay and then because the result is a little bit different
04:12:57.20 --> 04:13:01.04 it's possible I'm not that advanced to tell the difference and here dude here's why I know
04:13:01.04 --> 04:13:06.24 about the frozen banana want a banana starting to get uh right in a little bit past right
04:13:06.24 --> 04:13:11.92 the kind of brown is taking over you can peel it and freeze it as what I do yes I didn't know that
04:13:11.92 --> 04:13:16.72 Sarah told me that yeah it was like cool sure enough she has two of them frozen inside because they
04:13:16.72 --> 04:13:22.48 need a banana so I put the frozen one in I was like man this works perfect yeah they get creamier
04:13:22.48 --> 04:13:28.56 when they're frozen no check that's my job I might as similar to you we had to wait
04:13:28.56 --> 04:13:36.32 over four hours for you to find me drop this knowledge the secret that's gonna be a foodie
04:13:36.32 --> 04:13:41.84 what is that okay good these we grew up my mom used to make ice cream at home from frozen
04:13:41.84 --> 04:13:45.68 bananas and just like literally put them through the champion juicer freeze them put them through
04:13:45.68 --> 04:13:51.60 the champion juicer maybe add a little bit of like whatever some to kind of like put it up to the
04:13:51.60 --> 04:13:59.28 next level but like you have like homemade soft serve immediately so the frozen bananas I vouch for
04:13:59.28 --> 04:14:03.44 I I'm waiting for the plant based milk yeah to come out I don't know if I talk to you or
04:14:03.44 --> 04:14:11.60 paint about that but you may have to hear it but that's what I do is for after my workouts every
04:14:11.60 --> 04:14:17.92 day my first meal that's my first meal as a shake I'd kind of fast until after that but I do the
04:14:17.92 --> 04:14:23.76 the protein powder the almond milk the peanut butter just a healthy healthy so I doll up
04:14:23.76 --> 04:14:31.28 these things and then someone's going to stir up all the food got the frozen banana and then I throw in I throw in some
04:14:31.28 --> 04:14:39.04 chia seeds some pumpkin seeds and flat seeds but you guys maybe feel like a amateur so before I don't
04:14:39.04 --> 04:14:47.84 know that's not really a bad thing I go I go milk I don't make it that's it's true it's a
04:14:47.84 --> 04:14:54.88 hardy shake but then I'm good like I'm good until like you know I look an early dinner. Yeah yeah that's kind
04:14:54.88 --> 04:15:00.16 of the good thing you can use it for many different reasons you know you can do like a meal replacement
04:15:00.16 --> 04:15:05.84 or just a supplementation for the protein or just a dessert or you can just relax it by
04:15:05.84 --> 04:15:11.36 if you said protein that's how I'm the push I didn't smell no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
04:15:11.36 --> 04:15:16.40 okay for those I would put that as the lotion you said you said protein in flex double flexed your
04:15:16.40 --> 04:15:23.60 body says it happened I'm also witnessed it I witnessed it it's it's serious we're in the
04:15:23.60 --> 04:15:30.08 way so we can get these things at many places you're gonna be on the look up for any of these
04:15:30.08 --> 04:15:35.12 places you can get all this stuff at first wah wah east coast wah was only on the east coast
04:15:35.12 --> 04:15:43.76 right yes okay wah wah um at origin main dot com jockel fuel dot com jockel fuel dot com kind of the same
04:15:44.24 --> 04:15:50.72 what do you call trajectory yeah go vitamin chockel and the vitamin choc yes sir by the way this is
04:15:50.72 --> 04:15:58.48 important actually because shipping is a problem right financially it can cost a lot of money to
04:15:58.48 --> 04:16:05.36 ship something here's the deal if you subscribe to any of these items shipping free wow so we're trying
04:16:05.36 --> 04:16:10.40 to look there's we're talking about tech companies there's obviously some big tech companies out there
04:16:10.40 --> 04:16:14.48 that are hard to compete with in fact we you can't be them join them we join them it's fine
04:16:14.48 --> 04:16:19.44 you can get the stuff there because it's free shipping you know it's like a it's like sort of a
04:16:19.92 --> 04:16:24.96 that's a prime merry reason why people might order from this particular place which is cool we're
04:16:24.96 --> 04:16:31.20 down we appreciate it hundred percent that's fine but if you wanted to just go straight to the source
04:16:31.20 --> 04:16:35.12 but you didn't want to spend money on shipping we got you covered and it took us a while to figure
04:16:35.12 --> 04:16:41.52 out how we could balance it if you subscribe shipping's free on whatever you order so that's kind of
04:16:41.52 --> 04:16:52.56 huge when you're talking about it's a very rich and protein right now yeah and echo no offense
04:16:52.56 --> 04:16:58.56 to echo sometimes he's not quite the pinnacle of organization morning comes
04:17:00.56 --> 04:17:06.40 I'm doing the best it comes it's a matter of it look again look I I preface it by saying no offense
04:17:06.40 --> 04:17:11.92 so therefore you can't be offended yeah yeah I'm doing the best I can't over here I'm out of
04:17:11.92 --> 04:17:18.08 mold by the way there you go why are you subscribed well got issues yeah that is huge nonetheless
04:17:18.08 --> 04:17:23.60 over there flexing your biases right now all the way look this is where how and where we can get
04:17:23.60 --> 04:17:31.36 all these things also way to stay on the path do you do you do to more martial arts martial arts good
04:17:31.36 --> 04:17:36.80 for you it's good for your mind body I'm glad you're being diplomatic now well he's being diplomatic
04:17:36.80 --> 04:17:42.96 and like including all increase my almost life he's never said anything like that before ever
04:17:42.96 --> 04:17:47.36 we talk about doing martial arts we're talking about you do to over here on our side
04:17:47.36 --> 04:17:51.92 that's what we're talking about you are correct but go ahead continue this is a diplomatic
04:17:51.92 --> 04:17:56.40 he's the truth he's diplomacy already today just hang out with you he's got a low-ha
04:17:56.40 --> 04:18:02.08 it's just he's this guy has no a low-hafer other martial arts yeah it's like that you're here
04:18:02.08 --> 04:18:07.04 okay everything's cool well either way whatever martial arts we're doing
04:18:08.40 --> 04:18:13.52 say do that stuff in the event of you doing jujitsu you're gonna need a key and or a
04:18:13.52 --> 04:18:18.88 rash guard get those as well from origin how much did you have you trained a little bit not a lot
04:18:18.88 --> 04:18:25.36 I mean I the most the most if you could I guess within the family would be army combatives
04:18:25.36 --> 04:18:30.72 okay just legit yeah the army combatives is is a great program yeah I'll apply to you do
04:18:30.72 --> 04:18:38.24 guys exactly I I early on I guess the the the the the martial art that I trained the most and was
04:18:38.24 --> 04:18:43.36 was Brazilian cupueta oh that's right I was it makes me laugh every time I hear you pronounce
04:18:43.36 --> 04:18:48.64 English words with a Brazilian Portuguese accent oh okay I was like yeah I know that's about
04:18:48.64 --> 04:18:53.60 go I talk I said earlier starting office program that I'm very I look I just say what I say
04:18:53.60 --> 04:18:57.92 when it comes to you know Brazilian Portuguese words like if you're gonna talk to me about oh you
04:18:57.92 --> 04:19:06.16 train cup wait I've come to that you like a bro that's a little bit of a run now well
04:19:06.56 --> 04:19:11.68 and because of that I took summer classes in Brazilian Portuguese and Hawaii like uh like
04:19:11.68 --> 04:19:15.76 trying to learn the language I was I was getting fully immersed in the culture and and started to
04:19:15.76 --> 04:19:21.12 do a lot of a lot of the my friends who did cupueta also did jujitsu and metal a lot there's a
04:19:21.12 --> 04:19:26.08 huge Brazilian community in Hawaii because of surfing and obviously most of them do either cupueta
04:19:26.08 --> 04:19:33.36 and jujitsu as well and but I just I was kind of um consumed I was training like six hours a day in
04:19:33.36 --> 04:19:39.76 cupueta and that was I was starting to teach and I was doing a bunch of stuff there but yeah so
04:19:39.76 --> 04:19:44.48 so the most time I spent doing any kind of grappling was was army combat of so which was fun
04:19:44.48 --> 04:19:49.44 well it's cool because now you're gonna be on the journey of jujitsu we're gonna get you a key yeah
04:19:49.44 --> 04:19:56.56 I want I really I I want to learn and I'm a big mix martial arts fan I have been for a long time
04:19:56.56 --> 04:20:01.44 and yeah you went up and trained with duku fist right yeah that was an incredible surprise that I
04:20:01.44 --> 04:20:08.80 was not expecting but he was there to train um Jiang Wiley and she was passing through doing
04:20:08.80 --> 04:20:15.12 a publicity thing so I got to meet her and spar with like use that word and very generously
04:20:15.68 --> 04:20:20.64 she's like come at me like kick me punch like do something like I don't know
04:20:21.92 --> 04:20:27.84 but it like like getting to hit some pads of duku was freaking incredible yeah no yeah it was awesome
04:20:27.84 --> 04:20:34.64 I've cornered a bunch of fighters at UFC and and whenever duku fist was there he's just like
04:20:34.64 --> 04:20:41.36 such an awesome guy super cool super nice super I mean obviously he's a great trainer and everything
04:20:41.36 --> 04:20:46.96 but I just remember to think and this guy's just freaking rad yeah totally totally anyway you know
04:20:46.96 --> 04:20:52.56 like he made us feel just great and um but what I was gonna say is the thing that I've always appreciated
04:20:52.56 --> 04:20:57.52 mocks most about mixed martial arts is you know yeah there are guys who are stronger and boxing
04:20:57.52 --> 04:21:03.52 or striking or whatever but this the strategic that goes into fighters who have a very strong
04:21:03.52 --> 04:21:10.80 ground game when you really watch it is I've just incredible and that's what I've loved most about
04:21:11.52 --> 04:21:16.88 the sport is the strategic thinking that goes into like I'm gonna do this and set you up for
04:21:16.88 --> 04:21:24.64 where I'm gonna put you in you know six moves later or whatever so yeah I'm now that I'm a little
04:21:24.64 --> 04:21:29.76 bit more free um I really do I've been telling my husband this I want to I want to learn we have
04:21:29.76 --> 04:21:37.28 connections in Hawaii and Islands uh speaking of geese jiu jiu jiu jiu geese and jeans and boots
04:21:37.28 --> 04:21:42.08 you went to the factory and name right I did have a job in the origin factory and main and
04:21:42.88 --> 04:21:48.72 to say I was stoked as an understatement and we made a little social media video about it and you know
04:21:48.72 --> 04:21:53.68 got some footage of peach on us around and talking about what they do brought the local media with us
04:21:53.68 --> 04:22:00.64 and local media did a story on on on origin but my husband will tell you in the car ride leaving
04:22:00.64 --> 04:22:06.88 I was so freaking stoked it was it was completely unexpected because I've I've had the privilege of
04:22:06.88 --> 04:22:11.68 going and visiting a number of you know local businesses and shops but the thing that really
04:22:13.12 --> 04:22:21.84 like struck home for me like in a in a visceral way was yeah awesome products but
04:22:21.84 --> 04:22:32.88 the spirit uh the spirit of origin came through loud and clear not just because peats good
04:22:32.88 --> 04:22:41.52 at talking about it but because of what I experienced in the people who work there and um the sense
04:22:41.52 --> 04:22:52.40 of pride and the sense of ownership of the thing that says right there we get to do this and
04:22:52.40 --> 04:22:59.12 and how deeply you all have built the foundation of this American business in the fabric of
04:22:59.12 --> 04:23:06.80 America and that like I was like I left there and I'm like I told peos like um like where do I sign up
04:23:06.80 --> 04:23:12.80 like how do I how do I join this because this is freaking amazing and I talked about it and just
04:23:12.80 --> 04:23:17.84 share that that's why I wanted to share um that video and just the experience of being able to go and
04:23:17.84 --> 04:23:24.56 visit and it was not on the way like farming tin main is on the way to nowhere else I was going
04:23:25.92 --> 04:23:32.08 and it was literally like I called an audible on my team and I'm like yeah we're in main and I'm
04:23:32.08 --> 04:23:40.08 going to take a two-hour like detour to go and visit because the story of uh that you guys are
04:23:40.08 --> 04:23:49.28 sharing of origin main is the story that needs to inspire America especially now in what what we
04:23:49.92 --> 04:23:56.80 can do what we can do here at home and that yes this is about supporting a local business is about
04:23:56.80 --> 04:24:02.000 supporting America and American jobs but it goes so much deeper than that that yeah of course
04:24:02.000 --> 04:24:07.92 there are challenges and there as adversity and you know foreign trade and like all of these other
04:24:07.92 --> 04:24:15.76 things but just like um you know peat talks about how he started right and and his freaking
04:24:15.76 --> 04:24:22.000 backyard built a factory because there wasn't one where there's a will there's a way and when you're
04:24:22.000 --> 04:24:31.36 rooted in this foundation of not just hey how can we make a bunch of money but how do how do you
04:24:31.36 --> 04:24:40.64 use business as a means to serve and have a positive impact in your community in the lives of the
04:24:40.64 --> 04:24:46.40 people who work there in the customers who know like hey I'm not just buying a product that's cool
04:24:46.40 --> 04:24:52.72 I'm supporting a mission that's much greater than any one of us as individuals and will have a
04:24:52.72 --> 04:24:59.04 much longer lasting impact yeah if you were to take what you just said if you were to if you
04:24:59.04 --> 04:25:02.72 and I were to look at each other and say hey let's make a business and let's make you know let's
04:25:02.72 --> 04:25:08.32 make clothes let's make a parallel let's make shoes and let's make money the last thing we would
04:25:08.32 --> 04:25:13.84 do to make money is try and build a factory in America correct and source everything from America
04:25:13.84 --> 04:25:19.84 we just said we just say it is absolutely sad and there's company upon company that their primary
04:25:19.84 --> 04:25:25.44 goals to make money that's their primary goal it's not to make a quality product it's not to be
04:25:25.44 --> 04:25:30.16 innovative with their products it's not to rebuild their community it's not to put money back into
04:25:30.16 --> 04:25:35.44 the community it's not to not to bring manufacturing back to America that's that's not even on their
04:25:35.44 --> 04:25:41.92 radar those are our primary goals now in order to do that we do we have to make money yes absolutely
04:25:41.92 --> 04:25:47.92 and we will but that's not why we're doing it if we just wanted to make money we wouldn't be
04:25:48.56 --> 04:25:53.60 there would be no factory it'd be it'd be a sweatshop overseas that's what it would be
04:25:53.60 --> 04:25:57.84 we're not gonna do that we're never gonna do that and you'd be no different than most of the others
04:25:57.84 --> 04:26:05.92 you know and and it would it you wouldn't be you origin wouldn't be origin then absolutely
04:26:07.20 --> 04:26:15.68 and to be quite frank with you money could not drive me or inspire me or motivate me
04:26:15.68 --> 04:26:26.96 one 100th the amount that it does to know that there's people in that town yes that are working
04:26:26.96 --> 04:26:34.40 that are have a career now you know we're taking millennials and teaching them a skill that was
04:26:34.40 --> 04:26:39.84 just always so close to being lost you saw them right there millennials that there's skills that
04:26:39.84 --> 04:26:46.32 were I mean are our our guide Lenny just died but he before he died he was able to pass on his knowledge
04:26:47.04 --> 04:26:54.72 that can be passed on could save it's there we're we're there and it's also also stoked you know
04:26:54.72 --> 04:26:58.32 you and our text and back and forth and I think I was trying to get you a pair of boots I was like
04:26:58.32 --> 04:27:03.36 hey we'll get you some boots and yeah we had some in deliver you boots but for you to go up there
04:27:03.36 --> 04:27:08.88 was I was so stoked that you could go up there and you could see it and and you know it's it's very
04:27:08.88 --> 04:27:14.88 cool to like I'll hear Joe Rogan talking about origin and even though he's not been there
04:27:15.68 --> 04:27:21.20 like he knows that's very cool and when I when I heard him talking about origin and he was just
04:27:21.20 --> 04:27:25.84 talking about it with someone else that was was on his show when I heard him talking about it
04:27:27.12 --> 04:27:33.76 so passionately I realized this is people get it you don't just you look it's awesome when you
04:27:33.76 --> 04:27:38.40 go they're not as soon you go there it's visceral when you go there but even if you don't go there
04:27:39.68 --> 04:27:45.28 you know you know that some that pair of jeans that you're wearing those are those are American
04:27:45.28 --> 04:27:53.84 made the hands that harvested the cotton processed it every step that's the amazing thing is and I you
04:27:53.84 --> 04:27:59.52 know some of my some of my friends and the military especially when they got their stimulus checks
04:27:59.52 --> 04:28:05.76 they're like I'm gonna make a choice with this money and I'm gonna go shopping at origin because
04:28:06.72 --> 04:28:14.48 cool stuff but I'm supporting America with these dollars and that that's the difference and that's
04:28:14.48 --> 04:28:21.84 the impact and and I I I loved sharing the story of my experience there to help inspire others
04:28:22.64 --> 04:28:28.32 who may aspire to do something similar but feel like the obstacles are too great but but
04:28:28.32 --> 04:28:33.68 and whether it's business or whatever I mean that the point is the motivation and the spirit of
04:28:33.68 --> 04:28:40.88 getting back to not planning this but getting back to our origins who we are as a country of
04:28:40.88 --> 04:28:48.80 entrepreneurs and innovators and people who are bringing different ideas to to and the pride
04:28:48.80 --> 04:28:58.000 the pride that goes that goes along with that origin USA yeah origin USA
04:28:58.000 --> 04:29:05.28 dot com if you want to get me stuff from there it's made by Americans for Americans true also
04:29:05.28 --> 04:29:11.84 me point your attention to jocco store dot com this is where you can represent why you're on the path
04:29:11.84 --> 04:29:17.28 there you go so yeah we have some some stuff that we have is from origin we got rash guards on there
04:29:18.16 --> 04:29:22.48 also we have hoodies and shirts and you know discipline equals freedom this kind of stuff I'm saying
04:29:22.48 --> 04:29:25.36 if you're going to go seems to get uncomfortable and you start talking about him
04:29:25.36 --> 04:29:32.56 is it that obvious is that obvious there's a visible shift here yeah in energy what's funny
04:29:32.56 --> 04:29:37.92 is it's kind of like a complimentary relationship because like my comfort increases when his
04:29:37.92 --> 04:29:42.88 disc comfort increases you same so it's like cool that's like you can kind of sense
04:29:42.88 --> 04:29:48.80 some pride when I talk about this store got a store by the way anyway yes this link was for
04:29:48.80 --> 04:29:55.52 him but shirts hoodies rash guards some hats on there some new stuff on there new design coming
04:29:55.52 --> 04:30:00.72 up soon really all that you know these are all things that happen decentralized command yep
04:30:00.72 --> 04:30:05.44 like I'm not over there pointing the finger making things happen that's echo Charles in his own
04:30:05.44 --> 04:30:12.72 little world well it's it's our world we have a subscription situation as well if you want
04:30:12.72 --> 04:30:19.20 like a new type of design kind of um is that what the is that where the run DMC t-shirt just came from yes
04:30:19.20 --> 04:30:25.04 that's legit I was good because I've proved these before they're done or sometimes sometimes
04:30:25.04 --> 04:30:32.48 there is a level of decentralized command but I also some people in the organization will say a case
04:30:32.48 --> 04:30:40.48 they need to get footage check so there is sometimes but occasionally things that by like he just
04:30:40.48 --> 04:30:49.12 made a run DMD run DMC t-shirt but it says discipline but it's D.F was a D.S.C PLN but it looks like the old school
04:30:49.12 --> 04:30:56.000 run DMC t-shirt so it's freaking legit that's it thought so too there's also one's like the element
04:30:56.000 --> 04:31:01.28 in the periodic table yeah element yeah so it's element D and it has all the the atomic weight
04:31:01.28 --> 04:31:08.08 1434 layers anyway these are kind of off shoot designs but they're cool relevant and there's
04:31:08.08 --> 04:31:13.92 layers oh here's the thing that's jacked up now I just realized if you wanted that run DMC discipline
04:31:13.92 --> 04:31:20.64 shirt you can only get it if you subscribe if you're a subscriber to the shirt locker the shirt locker
04:31:20.64 --> 04:31:27.68 of that hotel yeah once they're gone they're gone so man let me do it that's kind of a bummer
04:31:27.68 --> 04:31:33.04 yeah and by the way it seems like one person at this table does not have a subscription to this
04:31:33.04 --> 04:31:38.88 what's funny is I for real have a subscription to I for real don't oh you don't
04:31:38.88 --> 04:31:42.88 just jacked up brutal brutal I thought you were calling me out by not calling me out
04:31:42.88 --> 04:31:48.48 oh okay there's two people that don't have a subscription apparently thing that makes two of us
04:31:48.48 --> 04:31:56.88 they guess whatever either way maybe I have some extra oh cookie guys oh man that's cool yeah that

04:35:01.76 --> 04:35:07.28 flip side canvas flips side canvas dot com decoder my brother he makes all kinds of cool stuff

04:35:14.000 --> 04:35:18.000 on your wall to remind you of the path got a bunch of books
04:35:18.000 --> 04:35:25.28 uh I got a book called final spin which is the novel not out yet comes out in September
04:35:25.28 --> 04:35:32.000 I've been tracking that yeah it's pretty crazy I just got the final or I just did the final
04:35:32.000 --> 04:35:41.60 edits it's freaking I was my daughter my oldest daughter read it I was like how can you review this
04:35:41.60 --> 04:35:46.40 and so she read it and you know your kids are always like gonna be harsh critics or whatever
04:35:46.40 --> 04:35:51.68 and my I said oh you know she got done reading it so you know how how was it how did you like it
04:35:51.68 --> 04:35:56.16 and so she starts going you know I like this and I like that and then she she's got to a point and she
04:35:56.16 --> 04:36:02.24 started because it's an emotional situation she started to cry oh my god this is not lost you this was
04:36:02.24 --> 04:36:08.32 after a day after she read it she started crying and and she was like and and then I was kind of like oh
04:36:08.72 --> 04:36:15.28 I go I guess that's a good she she's like it's just that that part so and I'm okay so it's very interesting
04:36:15.28 --> 04:36:22.24 so not that it's just it's just not a sob story but it's just you want to write a book that moves people
04:36:22.24 --> 04:36:28.40 he well I mean yeah I guess I guess if it's not gonna have any impact or if it's gonna have
04:36:28.40 --> 04:36:34.32 an impact that's a good thing to make people think yeah and it's uh it's it's definitely even as I
04:36:34.32 --> 04:36:38.24 read it and I've read it now a hundred times because I have to edit it you know there's some parts
04:36:38.24 --> 04:36:44.88 where I'm reading it and it's definitely it's it's it's heavy it's heavy and it's got some really funny
04:36:44.88 --> 04:36:50.24 parts too a lot of the dialogue is really funny because you know it's reflective of kind of the
04:36:50.96 --> 04:36:56.96 dialogue that I have with people even though it's not about me or is it I'm watching it's been to
04:36:56.96 --> 04:37:00.16 interpretation yeah it's sort of an alternative
04:37:02.24 --> 04:37:07.60 anyways the book is called Final Spin and you can pre-order right now if you want to get a first
04:37:07.60 --> 04:37:14.32 a dish if you want to get a first a dish order now I look this is gonna be kind of a big deal to
04:37:14.32 --> 04:37:20.16 get the first a dish of the first novel you know I'm the one so I'm over-hyping that is the second
04:37:20.16 --> 04:37:28.56 in the works this this book will have no follow on okay for various reasons it
04:37:28.56 --> 04:37:38.56 pointy it does conclude it is called Final Spin it's not like first spin so it is called
04:37:38.56 --> 04:37:48.48 Final Spin but also I it's it is it is complete sure in my mind it's complete and so I don't want
04:37:48.48 --> 04:37:54.56 to carry the story on but you have more novels in you oh yeah maybe I got 14 novels that I thought
04:37:54.56 --> 04:38:02.40 of during the last half an hour yeah awesome yeah it's unfortunate for me it's always just
04:38:02.40 --> 04:38:08.32 people say I don't know what to write about I'm like god I wish I had that problem so that's that final
04:38:08.32 --> 04:38:13.36 spin pre-order leadership strategy in tactics field manual the code the valuation of protocol
04:38:13.36 --> 04:38:20.24 discipline it was freedom field manual way the warrior kid for field manual that's out way the warrior
04:38:20.24 --> 04:38:27.60 kid one two and three Mikey in the dragons I'll sit in into I was just an adjordan Peterson
04:38:29.84 --> 04:38:38.000 yesterday and he was just going off about the dragons which is a lot of what he does and interestingly
04:38:38.000 --> 04:38:45.04 enough I was like hmm sounds like this book called Mikey in the dragons so check that one out about
04:38:45.04 --> 04:38:54.56 face by David Hacworth there's a forward by me and Tossi you've I just got it in the mail a couple
04:38:54.56 --> 04:39:00.48 of days before I left Hawaii and I have read your forward okay and I'm just starting what's the
04:39:00.48 --> 04:39:10.40 impression starting the book um how incredibly impactful this book and this man has been on your
04:39:10.40 --> 04:39:21.44 life as a person but the thing that really like spoke to me was how this was kind of a your go to
04:39:21.44 --> 04:39:27.28 reference to help guide you through difficult leadership choices decisions challenges that you face
04:39:27.28 --> 04:39:33.92 in some of the most difficult environments I eat being in at war and and that you've never met the man
04:39:33.92 --> 04:39:44.64 and that was that came through very clear and you're gratitude to him in having this this book
04:39:44.64 --> 04:39:50.08 that provided you with that place where you could find the answers that you couldn't find anywhere else
04:39:50.08 --> 04:39:55.68 or help you see things in a different way that you wouldn't have seen otherwise through his experiences
04:39:55.68 --> 04:40:02.24 and how he handled things or his perspective and then the the maybe the most important thing was
04:40:02.24 --> 04:40:12.40 that all of that came from the foremost concern being care for your guys his soldiers your
04:40:12.40 --> 04:40:22.24 seals soldiers who you were were people who you were responsible for and I thought that was a
04:40:22.24 --> 04:40:27.68 really cool thing for me to come at I've only heard you talk about it but to come at this book
04:40:27.68 --> 04:40:33.52 and I'm really looking forward to to read it but to see that bridge in time and that that
04:40:34.16 --> 04:40:40.000 and conflicts and wars between a guy who served in in Vietnam and was a leader of soldiers in
04:40:40.000 --> 04:40:46.80 Vietnam to you in the experience that you had at the leader serving in Iraq and how there was such
04:40:48.48 --> 04:40:53.76 powerful connection between two different leaders and two different wars in different places
04:40:53.76 --> 04:40:59.36 and different times that that's not something I've really heard of before.
04:41:02.24 --> 04:41:07.84 It's weird because I as I read that book have you ever seen the movie that I think it's called the
04:41:07.84 --> 04:41:16.88 13th Warrior have you heard of this movie Tom Cruise no so anyways it's based on it's based on a book
04:41:16.88 --> 04:41:23.36 by Michael Criton and I can't remember the name of the book that it's based upon but it's about this
04:41:23.36 --> 04:41:34.24 Arabic person who gets somehow mixed up with the Vikings and there's a great scene and the
04:41:34.24 --> 04:41:41.68 Arabic guy is played by some famous actor I can't think of it. I could tell you really where she
04:41:41.68 --> 04:41:48.16 is coming up. But they show they they they do this scene where he's learning to speak
04:41:48.16 --> 04:41:53.60 Norwegian or whatever old Norse whatever language they're speaking and the way that they cut it up they're
04:41:53.60 --> 04:42:00.000 speaking Norwegian and then every once in a while an English word pops in which would have been an
04:42:00.000 --> 04:42:08.16 Arabic movie Arabic word but it's an English speaking movie so every once in a while an English word
04:42:08.16 --> 04:42:11.76 will pop in says about it. It's a rather rather rather rather a rather rather a rather
04:42:11.76 --> 04:42:18.40 bolder tree and so and he starts picking up and it's probably a two minute scene whereby the end
04:42:18.40 --> 04:42:24.32 all the words are in English. The reason I'm telling you this is because as you were talking about
04:42:24.32 --> 04:42:30.56 the book about face I feel like each time I read it like a little because it's not a book about
04:42:30.56 --> 04:42:33.92 leadership and you know you mentioned leadership it's not a book about leadership it's a book about
04:42:33.92 --> 04:42:40.08 a guy's life but it's like as each time I read it a little leadership thing would come through
04:42:40.08 --> 04:42:44.48 and then a little bit more and then a little bit more and eventually the whole thing I realized
04:42:44.48 --> 04:42:47.84 this whole thing is just about leadership and it's about how to take care of your troops and do
04:42:47.84 --> 04:42:54.64 the mission and it's it's I just had that thought as you were as you were describing the
04:42:55.36 --> 04:43:00.88 correlations between what he lived through and what I lived there which by the way just for the
04:43:00.88 --> 04:43:06.72 record not even close. He was in Korean Vietnam he's the he had three distinguished service
04:43:06.72 --> 04:43:14.48 crosses nine silver stuff I mean just totally different but good book check out.
04:43:14.48 --> 04:43:20.24 The closest thing that I can relate to in my time in the military is you mentioned band of
04:43:20.24 --> 04:43:27.68 brothers earlier and I was a brand new maybe I was an E3 or an E4 by that point but I picked up the
04:43:27.68 --> 04:43:33.60 book band of brothers before ever watching the the many series I don't even know if it was made at
04:43:33.60 --> 04:43:39.44 that time yet but I was brand new in the national guard I started reading the book just as we were
04:43:39.44 --> 04:43:44.48 about to go and do an annual training at Fort Indian Town Gap in Pennsylvania and I'm reading the
04:43:44.48 --> 04:43:49.60 book I'd like can't put it down we go there were there for ten days or two weeks or whatever it was
04:43:49.60 --> 04:43:55.60 on the plane going back to Hawaii and I finished the book and at the end of the book it says
04:43:56.56 --> 04:44:02.64 Dick Winners currently resides in Fort Indian Town Gap Pennsylvania where he lives with his wife
04:44:02.64 --> 04:44:08.72 yeah yeah and I'm just like why didn't I finish this two days earlier I would have definitely gone
04:44:08.72 --> 04:44:15.20 and knocked on this man and he was still alive at the time that was but but I've you know gone on
04:44:15.20 --> 04:44:20.16 and watched I mean I've watched this year I don't even know how many times I've watched it
04:44:20.72 --> 04:44:27.20 in OCS we had to write essays on different episodes from a leadership perspective leadership lessons
04:44:27.20 --> 04:44:34.40 good and bad and really analyzed each episode of that and so that's one I'm at that's the only kind
04:44:34.40 --> 04:44:40.96 of closest thing I can relate to we're going back and looking at him and his leadership and I always
04:44:40.96 --> 04:44:48.80 forget the guy's name but the guy who's Ross in France so thank you his his flawed leadership I would say
04:44:49.36 --> 04:44:56.56 and a lessons learned from that and as a specialist then and then a brand new lieutenant I I have
04:44:56.56 --> 04:45:01.76 often gone back to those leadership lessons including the ones of you know some of the
04:45:03.28 --> 04:45:09.20 gosh I'm forgetting the name now some of the enlisted characters and one that was played by Donnie
04:45:09.20 --> 04:45:15.84 Walberg um one of the main e-sixes and and that was I had a chance to meet Donnie Walberg
04:45:15.84 --> 04:45:21.04 out of veterans event and like I don't I don't really care about celebrities in general but I saw
04:45:21.04 --> 04:45:27.28 he was there I'm like I need to go speak to this person about band of brothers and it was it was
04:45:27.28 --> 04:45:32.88 really cool he's a huge huge huge supporter of veterans I was on a show called the billions
04:45:33.68 --> 04:45:39.68 you were yeah and the the one of the main characters and billions of guy name Axel Rod
04:45:39.68 --> 04:45:44.80 uh yeah is he also played dick winners he is forever dick winners in my mind I don't care
04:45:44.80 --> 04:45:49.92 he was in homeland too like yeah whatever your dick winners but we you know he we were sitting
04:45:49.92 --> 04:45:54.24 around and talking and and he said something along the lines of like oh you know I was in something
04:45:54.24 --> 04:46:00.000 called band of brothers like yeah I kind of I know I'm well aware of it and so we talked a
04:46:00.000 --> 04:46:07.84 bunch about it it was it was interesting because in those I'd never done any like Hollywood
04:46:08.24 --> 04:46:15.20 things before actually I was like said yeah yeah he likes to throw that out of me well when you do it
04:46:15.20 --> 04:46:24.80 you film the same thing 10 times if not more so like there's a scene where we're waking the guy up
04:46:24.80 --> 04:46:34.08 in bed and there's me and Ax and Wags have you watched billions before I've only seen one or two
04:46:34.08 --> 04:46:39.12 okay really it's a free-confidentastic show okay so me ax and why it's three characters and so we're
04:46:39.12 --> 04:46:47.000 waking the Guy up the first time we film it is like they're filming all three of us and we
04:46:47.000 --> 04:46:52.24 deliver the lines and then you stop and then they reset up all the cameras and then they do it
04:46:52.24 --> 04:46:55.84 again but they're just filming me and then they reset up the cameras and they do again they're
04:46:55.84 --> 04:46:59.20 just filming Wags they we filmed again they they're just filming Ax and they and they
04:46:59.20 --> 04:47:02.32 we filmed again they're just filming the girl in bed and they reformed again and then they do
04:47:02.32 --> 04:47:08.88 it from a hideous and then do it so it ends up on you and doing this thing 10 times 15 times
04:47:08.88 --> 04:47:11.56 And by the way, if someone messes up, doing it again.
04:47:12.68 --> 04:47:15.36 So I was talking to him and I said,
04:47:15.36 --> 04:47:18.56 how in God's name did you film like a battle scene?
04:47:18.56 --> 04:47:19.24 Yeah.
04:47:19.24 --> 04:47:20.32 How the hell did you do that?
04:47:20.32 --> 04:47:23.48 He's totally different because there's basically
04:47:23.48 --> 04:47:26.76 guys running around with cameras and they do it
04:47:26.76 --> 04:47:30.08 one freaking time and they just have to get it right.
04:47:30.08 --> 04:47:32.04 And they're running through it because explosions
04:47:32.04 --> 04:47:34.48 are going off and like a building is gonna get destroyed.
04:47:34.48 --> 04:47:35.84 And it's only gonna get one take.
04:47:35.84 --> 04:47:36.68 Yeah.
04:47:36.68 --> 04:47:38.12 So that was pretty interesting.
04:47:38.12 --> 04:47:39.44 No pressure, right?
04:47:39.44 --> 04:47:40.68 He's an actor.
04:47:40.68 --> 04:47:44.48 Not only because of that, just the logistics of it,
04:47:44.48 --> 04:47:47.84 but like the history and what you're doing
04:47:47.84 --> 04:47:50.96 and who you're representing like my gosh,
04:47:50.96 --> 04:47:52.36 I can imagine.
04:47:52.36 --> 04:47:55.72 He, um, so if someone messes up,
04:47:57.32 --> 04:47:59.92 the director comes in like talks to him, right?
04:48:00.92 --> 04:48:01.72 He's a rapper man.
04:48:01.72 --> 04:48:02.60 Like I'm serious.
04:48:02.60 --> 04:48:04.72 So if someone, maybe he doesn't mess up,
04:48:04.72 --> 04:48:06.84 but maybe he's not putting the right right,
04:48:06.84 --> 04:48:08.12 stank on it, right?
04:48:08.12 --> 04:48:08.92 You know what I was like,
04:48:08.92 --> 04:48:10.92 your technical intentions too little.
04:48:10.92 --> 04:48:13.16 You know, you're being too emotional.
04:48:13.16 --> 04:48:14.68 And so it happened.
04:48:14.68 --> 04:48:16.56 I didn't really, I didn't know any of this.
04:48:16.56 --> 04:48:19.96 I do playing a military person.
04:48:19.96 --> 04:48:20.96 I played yourself.
04:48:20.96 --> 04:48:23.20 I, I, I had a real stretch of a role.
04:48:23.20 --> 04:48:25.24 I played me.
04:48:25.24 --> 04:48:25.76 Okay.
04:48:25.76 --> 04:48:26.60 All right.
04:48:26.60 --> 04:48:27.64 Yeah, so I played me and I was,
04:48:27.64 --> 04:48:29.76 whenever trying to, I was trying to help a guy
04:48:29.76 --> 04:48:32.72 win a, a smoker's fight of boxing match.
04:48:32.72 --> 04:48:33.60 And we're training him.
04:48:33.60 --> 04:48:37.20 Um, but if you mess up,
04:48:37.20 --> 04:48:41.24 or you don't put enough for you put a little too much or whatever,
04:48:41.24 --> 04:48:46.80 the director, actually the first the assistant director's going to come and give you a little nudge in the right direction of haters.
04:48:46.80 --> 04:48:49.24 You know, you don't be so loud.
04:48:49.24 --> 04:48:50.92 You know, you're too emotional.
04:48:50.92 --> 04:48:52.12 This isn't supposed to be funny or whatever.
04:48:52.12 --> 04:48:52.84 Something like that.
04:48:52.84 --> 04:48:54.96 And so this actually happened to me.
04:48:54.96 --> 04:48:56.92 I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about stuff like this.
04:48:56.92 --> 04:48:58.04 Maybe it's off limits.
04:48:58.04 --> 04:48:59.36 But it's done.
04:48:59.36 --> 04:49:00.04 It's fine.
04:49:00.04 --> 04:49:02.20 It happened to one of the other actors.
04:49:02.20 --> 04:49:05.48 We were doing it is just mean one of their actors in a scene.
04:49:05.48 --> 04:49:07.72 And we do it.
04:49:07.72 --> 04:49:08.84 And I'm just doing what I do.
04:49:08.84 --> 04:49:11.32 So honestly, it's pretty, if I have to get talk to it,
04:49:11.32 --> 04:49:12.92 it's a problem because I'm just a nice guy.
04:49:12.92 --> 04:49:15.28 So I'm doing what I'm doing.
04:49:15.28 --> 04:49:19.24 And the assistant director comes down first and is like,
04:49:19.24 --> 04:49:21.16 you know, I want to back that down a little bit.
04:49:21.16 --> 04:49:22.80 Don't talk to me, but talk to the other guy.
04:49:22.80 --> 04:49:24.60 And, and he's like, well, we're going to do it again.
04:49:24.60 --> 04:49:25.72 He's like, yeah, we're going to do it again,
04:49:25.72 --> 04:49:27.88 which is kind of a big deal like,
04:49:27.88 --> 04:49:29.52 it's not a small thing, right?
04:49:29.52 --> 04:49:31.000 We're actually, because I remember saying,
04:49:31.000 --> 04:49:31.96 wait, we're going to have to shoot this.
04:49:31.96 --> 04:49:33.72 I'm going to go, yeah, we're going to shoot it again.
04:49:33.72 --> 04:49:36.000 So it's kind of, ooh.
04:49:36.000 --> 04:49:39.04 So I realized that this was kind of a thing.
04:49:39.04 --> 04:49:41.60 If you, and then if you continue to mess up,
04:49:41.60 --> 04:49:43.32 then it's not just the assistant director,
04:49:43.32 --> 04:49:46.64 it's the director is going to come down and try and give you,
04:49:46.64 --> 04:49:48.76 you know, whatever, whatever they give you.
04:49:48.76 --> 04:49:50.40 They give you a motivation.
04:49:50.40 --> 04:49:52.24 But this is the problem.
04:49:52.24 --> 04:49:55.36 And so I'm watching this going, I don't want none of this.
04:49:55.36 --> 04:49:58.04 And so I remember what I,
04:49:58.04 --> 04:50:01.32 so now it's me, accent wax,
04:50:01.32 --> 04:50:03.08 and they're the main guys and these guys,
04:50:03.08 --> 04:50:05.20 and I didn't know anything about anything, right?
04:50:05.20 --> 04:50:07.40 But this is a very popular show,
04:50:07.40 --> 04:50:10.08 and it's a incredibly well written show.
04:50:10.08 --> 04:50:12.40 The writers, I know the writers now,
04:50:12.40 --> 04:50:14.28 and they're just so good.
04:50:14.28 --> 04:50:16.84 And you understand, so anyway,
04:50:16.84 --> 04:50:21.20 there, we do a take, right?
04:50:21.20 --> 04:50:22.12 Hollywood.
04:50:22.12 --> 04:50:25.28 We do a take, and like, you can hear,
04:50:25.28 --> 04:50:27.28 you can hear like radios, like you can hear some,
04:50:27.28 --> 04:50:31.60 and you, so now you realize someone messed up, right?
04:50:31.60 --> 04:50:33.92 And then they come walking up,
04:50:33.92 --> 04:50:36.40 and he comes walking up,
04:50:36.40 --> 04:50:38.12 you can use behind us to directly pull
04:50:38.12 --> 04:50:40.72 some of the other guys, and I was like,
04:50:40.72 --> 04:50:43.28 and I said to, accent, I was like,
04:50:43.28 --> 04:50:45.08 real I thought he was coming for me.
04:50:45.08 --> 04:50:47.40 And he goes, we all think that,
04:50:47.40 --> 04:50:48.44 we're like,
04:50:48.44 --> 04:50:52.92 oh, you're not alone, even the pros don't like,
04:50:52.92 --> 04:50:55.24 oh, get the talking to.
04:50:55.24 --> 04:50:57.64 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so there you go.
04:50:57.64 --> 04:50:59.56 Other books, extreme ownership, first book,
04:50:59.56 --> 04:51:03.60 I wrote about leadership, and then the dichotomy of leadership.

04:52:17.72 --> 04:52:18.88 not being aggressive enough.

04:52:59.96 --> 04:53:03.72 well, we went to the battlefield of Chickamaga
04:53:03.72 --> 04:53:07.60 when I was in OCS and we did that as a class.
04:53:07.60 --> 04:53:08.68 So good.
04:53:08.68 --> 04:53:11.04 Incredible bringing history to life
04:53:11.04 --> 04:53:13.24 and making it relevant, especially
04:53:13.24 --> 04:53:15.16 from a leadership perspective that applies
04:53:15.16 --> 04:53:17.12 whether you're in the military or not.
04:53:17.12 --> 04:53:20.40 But something I found out pretty cool
04:53:20.40 --> 04:53:22.04 in the last year or so,
04:53:22.04 --> 04:53:25.12 I was asked to be on the show on PBS,
04:53:25.12 --> 04:53:27.08 called Finding Your Roots.
04:53:27.08 --> 04:53:30.84 And it's a show that features different people
04:53:30.84 --> 04:53:31.88 in my episode.
04:53:31.88 --> 04:53:34.36 They also had Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio,
04:53:34.36 --> 04:53:37.20 but like Oprah, they had different people on
04:53:37.20 --> 04:53:40.60 and they dig into your genealogy
04:53:40.60 --> 04:53:43.28 and find stories about your roots,
04:53:43.28 --> 04:53:44.92 where you come from, who you come from.
04:53:44.92 --> 04:53:47.36 And I found out that
04:53:47.36 --> 04:53:52.36 one of my ancestors on my mother's side of the family
04:53:53.44 --> 04:53:56.32 was 39, 40 years old
04:53:56.32 --> 04:54:01.32 when he volunteered to serve in the Union army
04:54:03.08 --> 04:54:08.08 and that he, and they had the documentation there
04:54:08.36 --> 04:54:12.36 of one of those battlefields
04:54:12.36 --> 04:54:16.64 where he fought that I had been to previously
04:54:16.64 --> 04:54:19.28 and visited and walked through.
04:54:19.28 --> 04:54:21.84 And it was the most like,
04:54:21.84 --> 04:54:24.44 it was the most incredible thing on many levels
04:54:24.44 --> 04:54:28.28 to see like this guy gave up his life to go
04:54:28.28 --> 04:54:32.16 and fight for what he believed in
04:54:32.16 --> 04:54:35.28 and that I had generations later,
04:54:35.28 --> 04:54:37.76 not only physically walked through that battlefield
04:54:37.76 --> 04:54:42.76 where he was, but also chose a similar path
04:54:43.08 --> 04:54:44.60 with my life.
04:54:44.60 --> 04:54:47.96 And so it was just, it was, it was
04:54:47.96 --> 04:54:50.56 and I've gone back to Gettysburg a few times since
04:54:50.56 --> 04:54:53.80 and every single time I go,
04:54:55.56 --> 04:54:58.68 it's an incredibly powerful experience
04:54:58.68 --> 04:54:59.60 incredibly powerful.
04:54:59.60 --> 04:55:01.72 And to go to the place where,
04:55:01.72 --> 04:55:05.32 of course, Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg address.
04:55:05.32 --> 04:55:08.36 Yeah, yeah, it's when,
04:55:08.36 --> 04:55:11.60 because we basically we spend the two days walking
04:55:11.60 --> 04:55:13.56 and then when we wrap it up
04:55:13.56 --> 04:55:16.92 and you kind of now you clearly know
04:55:16.92 --> 04:55:19.44 and you've seen the low ground,
04:55:19.44 --> 04:55:22.44 the high ground, the trees, the buildings
04:55:22.44 --> 04:55:26.64 and you're walking worth thousands of men were killed.
04:55:26.64 --> 04:55:27.48 Yeah.
04:55:28.92 --> 04:55:33.60 It's just unbelievable, it's an unbelievable event.
04:55:34.56 --> 04:55:35.76 It's an unbelievable place
04:55:35.76 --> 04:55:38.24 and it's an incredible way to learn and solidify those.
04:55:38.24 --> 04:55:42.76 So that's EF, echelonfront.com slash events
04:55:42.76 --> 04:55:45.16 if you wanna go, it's an April.
04:55:45.16 --> 04:55:47.56 So, and if you wanna help service members,
04:55:47.56 --> 04:55:49.28 active and retired their families,
04:55:49.28 --> 04:55:52.40 gold star families, then check out Mark Lee's mom.
04:55:53.48 --> 04:55:57.36 She's got a charity organization, mom and Lee,
04:55:57.36 --> 04:55:59.20 if you wanna donate or you wanna get involved,
04:55:59.20 --> 04:56:02.96 go to americasmideoriors.org.
04:56:03.92 --> 04:56:08.92 And if you want more of my imposing interrogations
04:56:08.92 --> 04:56:13.92 or you want more of Echos quiet questions.
04:56:15.68 --> 04:56:17.36 And pop culture commentary.
04:56:17.36 --> 04:56:19.36 Pop culture commentary.
04:56:19.36 --> 04:56:24.36 I just, so whatever I'm giving Echos hard time,
04:56:24.52 --> 04:56:27.72 if it's a pretty good one, then he'll say to me like,
04:56:27.72 --> 04:56:29.60 you're happy with yourself, aren't you?
04:56:29.60 --> 04:56:31.88 Really enjoy yourself, aren't you?
04:56:31.88 --> 04:56:33.64 You're really enjoying yourself, aren't you?
04:56:33.64 --> 04:56:35.60 You think you're good, don't you?
04:56:35.60 --> 04:56:39.52 And that's how I know I'm kinda getting there.
04:56:39.52 --> 04:56:42.08 And as I got, as when we got here today,
04:56:42.08 --> 04:56:45.64 as I got out of the car, I was responding
04:56:45.64 --> 04:56:50.48 to Twitter or Instagram, and I had just made a comment.
04:56:50.48 --> 04:56:51.60 And I got out of the car as a day,
04:56:51.60 --> 04:56:54.12 you know, I'll sometimes you say that to me.
04:56:54.12 --> 04:56:56.24 Cause someone had said the last woman
04:56:56.24 --> 04:56:58.24 that was on Holly McKay, someone had said,
04:56:58.24 --> 04:57:01.76 oh, did she, does she stay for the support section?
04:57:01.76 --> 04:57:03.48 Meaning what we've dragged you into
04:57:03.48 --> 04:57:06.64 from the fast freaking hour and just about.
04:57:06.64 --> 04:57:11.64 And I said, no, she was able to withstand,
04:57:12.48 --> 04:57:16.44 you know, ISIS interrogations, but she couldn't hang
04:57:16.44 --> 04:57:19.48 with Echos Charles and the support.
04:57:19.48 --> 04:57:20.56 So there you go.
04:57:20.56 --> 04:57:22.60 Yeah, he's very happy with that one.
04:57:22.60 --> 04:57:26.04 Yeah, he's the pride in the tone of the comment.
04:57:26.04 --> 04:57:27.04 There you go.
04:57:27.04 --> 04:57:29.20 Admittedly so guilty.
04:57:29.20 --> 04:57:32.92 If you want more of us, you can find us on the internet
04:57:32.92 --> 04:57:35.16 and that's including TLC's way.
04:57:35.16 --> 04:57:39.88 TLC's well at TLC Gabbard, Echoes At Echo Charles,
04:57:39.88 --> 04:57:41.52 and I am at Jocca Willing.
04:57:41.52 --> 04:57:43.32 Echo Charles, you got anything else?
04:57:43.32 --> 04:57:45.08 Are you running for president again ever,
04:57:45.08 --> 04:57:47.28 or even possibly?
04:57:47.28 --> 04:57:48.12 Do you think?
04:57:48.12 --> 04:57:48.96 I don't know.
04:57:48.96 --> 04:57:51.32 I'm not thinking about it at all.
04:57:51.32 --> 04:57:53.48 If you did, would you ask about aliens?
04:57:53.48 --> 04:57:54.48 Remember how?
04:57:54.48 --> 04:57:56.52 Who's someone asked about aliens, right?
04:57:56.52 --> 04:57:57.36 I think so.
04:57:57.36 --> 04:57:59.92 I think it was like Clinton or something.
04:57:59.92 --> 04:58:01.48 It's not on the top of my list.
04:58:01.48 --> 04:58:02.76 I understand.
04:58:02.76 --> 04:58:04.52 Put it that way.
04:58:04.52 --> 04:58:05.52 There you go.
04:58:05.52 --> 04:58:07.40 Did I say something about Echoes questions?
04:58:07.40 --> 04:58:09.20 Earlier.
04:58:09.20 --> 04:58:11.20 He saved the best for last.
04:58:11.20 --> 04:58:14.56 What's funny is when I first met you or whatever.
04:58:14.56 --> 04:58:15.88 I was like, I don't think I ever
04:58:15.88 --> 04:58:18.04 met anyone that ran for president before.
04:58:18.04 --> 04:58:19.76 So then you know how you kind of think,
04:58:19.76 --> 04:58:21.04 like, what would I ask?
04:58:21.04 --> 04:58:22.04 And then for some reason.
04:58:22.04 --> 04:58:22.88 This is it.
04:58:22.88 --> 04:58:24.44 Yeah, this is the moment.
04:58:24.44 --> 04:58:26.84 All the rest of the stuff is like, OK, whatever.
04:58:26.84 --> 04:58:29.92 But oh, man.
04:58:29.92 --> 04:58:31.28 God, you have nothing else.
04:58:31.28 --> 04:58:32.40 But thank you.
04:58:32.40 --> 04:58:33.40 Awesome.
04:58:33.40 --> 04:58:34.40 Toll see.
04:58:34.40 --> 04:58:35.40 Thank you.
04:58:35.40 --> 04:58:36.40 Any closing thoughts?
04:58:36.40 --> 04:58:38.40 It's great to be here.
04:58:38.40 --> 04:58:41.20 And we've covered a lot.
04:58:41.20 --> 04:58:43.000 And there's a lot more to come.
04:58:43.000 --> 04:58:44.000 Yeah.
04:58:44.000 --> 04:58:45.000 Awesome.
04:58:45.000 --> 04:58:48.000 Well, obviously, thanks for coming on.
04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:49.80 I know we try to make this happen for a little bit.
04:58:49.80 --> 04:58:52.64 And glad you kind of finally get on here.
04:58:52.64 --> 04:58:56.000 And thanks for your service in the United States government.
04:58:56.000 --> 04:58:57.000 Of course.
04:58:57.000 --> 04:59:01.28 But also, obviously, thanks for your service as a soldier, as a leader.
04:59:01.28 --> 04:59:09.96 You're putting your life on the hold and your life at risk to defend the freedoms and the
04:59:09.96 --> 04:59:13.92 way of life that we hold sacred.
04:59:13.92 --> 04:59:20.80 And the same goes to the rest of the military personnel out there around the world.
04:59:20.80 --> 04:59:26.36 On those forgotten barricades on the front lines of freedom, thank you for defending us.
04:59:26.36 --> 04:59:30.16 And to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers
04:59:30.16 --> 04:59:35.24 and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders,
04:59:35.24 --> 04:59:40.88 thank you for defending us as well here at home.
04:59:40.88 --> 04:59:53.44 And to everyone else out there, well, for one thing, ask yourself, is today the day.
04:59:53.44 --> 04:59:56.40 Is today the day.
04:59:56.40 --> 05:00:03.000 And live your life thinking that today could be the day.
05:00:03.000 --> 05:00:12.000 And that means remember, some of that Aloha spirit that Tulsi talks about.
05:00:12.000 --> 05:00:17.08 Treat people with Aloha, treat them with respect and compassion and try and help out other
05:00:17.08 --> 05:00:18.08 people.
05:00:18.08 --> 05:00:19.08 And you do that.
05:00:19.08 --> 05:00:31.56 All those things by first putting your own ego in check, listen more than you talk, praise
05:00:31.56 --> 05:00:39.04 more than you punish, stand up for what you believe in while respecting other people's
05:00:39.04 --> 05:00:48.04 beliefs to and remember, always remember that we are stronger.
05:00:48.04 --> 05:00:53.04 Together.
05:00:53.04 --> 05:01:10.48 And until next time, this is Tulsi and echo and jacco.
