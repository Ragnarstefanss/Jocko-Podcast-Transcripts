[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 326 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:07] Throughout October 30th and 31st, 2011, in furtherance of the Drug Enforcement Administration's
[00:00:16] Drug Law Enforcement Mission in Afghanistan, special agents of the DEA's Foreign Deployed Advisory Support
[00:00:24] or Fast Team, conducted counter-narcotics, counter-insurgency operations with their police partners
[00:00:31] from the Afghan National Interdiction Unit assisted by the Australian Defense Forces.
[00:00:37] The task force departed their base via four helicopters as part of a mission to execute Afghan
[00:00:43] drug warrants and to search for narcotics, cashes, and heroin production labs.
[00:00:48] The team began to search the target area and accompanying opium bizarre when they began to receive
[00:00:56] sporadic incoming enemy fire. They accomplished their assigned duties and then maneuvered
[00:01:04] to the extraction location all-wall under sporadic enemy fire. When the task force arrived at the
[00:01:10] helicopter landing zones, they continued to receive effective enemy fire. One of the four
[00:01:15] helicopters forced to make an additional orbit and subsequently land in the vicinity of special
[00:01:20] agents, pierceante, Johnson, Vanderbilt, Harris, Stewart, Fisher, Portinga, and five members
[00:01:29] from the Australian Special Forces. This helicopter landed under fire.
[00:01:36] Special agent, Pursante, laid down suppressive fire, which enabled special agents to
[00:01:41] Stewart Harris and Fisher to board the helicopter. Once inside, special agents Stewart
[00:01:46] continued applying suppressive fire. Special agents Stewart directed an Afghan door gunner to initiate
[00:01:52] suppressive fire in an attempt to cover the remaining members of the team still outside the helicopter.
[00:01:58] Special agent Pursante was approximately 10 meters from the rear of the helicopter when he was hit by
[00:02:04] enemy fire. The round penetrated his ballistic helmet, entered above his right eye and exited
[00:02:13] above his left eye and he was immediately rendered unconscious and fell to the ground.
[00:02:20] Special agent Portinga positioned himself at the rear of the helicopter and continued laying down
[00:02:26] suppressive fire as special agent Pursante was being brought back into the helicopter.
[00:02:31] He instinctively put himself in harm's way and returned fire until all personnel were on board
[00:02:38] the helicopter as the helicopter took off. Special agents Vanderbilt, Johnson, and Harris immediately
[00:02:44] rendered first aid to special agent Pursante and controlled his bleeding, maintained an open air
[00:02:49] way and stabilized him. Special agent Pursante was eventually transferred to the Veterans
[00:02:56] Affairs Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia for continued treatment and rehabilitation. The actions of
[00:03:03] all agents involved both before and following the shooting were very clearly heroic.
[00:03:15] And that right there was an excerpt from an article by the US Department of Justice
[00:03:22] who oversees the DEA and special agent Joseph Pursante survived that round to the head.
[00:03:33] He became the first ever member of the DEA to receive the secretary of defense metal for the
[00:03:40] defense of freedom and also received the federal congressional badge of bravery.
[00:03:46] But that bullet did do significant damage most significantly. It rendered special agent Pursante blind.
[00:03:59] But he has continued to drive on to grow to teach and a certain credible example of
[00:04:07] perseverance for all of us and is an honor to have him here with us tonight to share some of his
[00:04:14] experiences and lessons learned. Joe, thanks for coming on man. You're quite welcome. First I want
[00:04:22] to say it's an honor to be part of this podcast and I was very flattered that you guys asked me to
[00:04:28] be on it. Well you're the first DEA guy we've got here. So you got another first under your belt now.
[00:04:38] But you didn't start off in the DEA. Let's let's like I like to go back to the beginning.
[00:04:41] Let's figure out where you came from. How you ended up being who you are. Born in Detroit, right?
[00:04:48] Yes. Actually grew up was born and raised in the city of Detroit. My dad was a police officer there.
[00:04:55] And at the time there was residency so we had to live in a city. I'm actually third generation
[00:05:01] law enforcement officer and my family. When you say there was residency, what do you mean by that?
[00:05:07] You had to live in the city. You had to live in the city to be a police officer in the city. Yes. Or any
[00:05:10] at the time any city workers? Wow. If you're a fire fighter or you know work for the city's
[00:05:16] sanitation and things like that, you had to live in the city. So we all kind of clustered and huddled
[00:05:20] in little areas. And your dad was a cop. His whole career that was what he did. Yes. Some people
[00:05:27] tired in Detroit 1990 then went on to work at the University of Michigan. Their police department
[00:05:34] eventually became chief of police there. Did you have aspirations of being a cop as well?
[00:05:41] Yes. You know growing up I always played team sports. It was fortunate enough to
[00:05:47] play college and football to smaller school and southern Michigan. And I always like that kind of team
[00:05:52] atmosphere. And my father he worked conspiracy in our comics for years and years in Detroit police
[00:05:59] department. And I just saw that kind of team environment team atmosphere and it kind of drew me to it.
[00:06:07] Even though my father never pushed me to go into law enforcement and actually I'm when I went away
[00:06:13] to college. My major at first was sports medicine. I wanted to be an athletic trainer and then
[00:06:20] the more I thought about him like you know what I really want to do this law enforcement thing.
[00:06:25] So I talked to my dad and he's like okay you know I support you and if you're going to do
[00:06:31] the law enforcement he worked on a DEA task force and a drug task force there and he says you know
[00:06:39] I would encourage you to go federal just because the pay is a little better you get to travel the
[00:06:45] world and you get to see and do a lot of things and I've always been a kind of rough tumble person
[00:06:52] and DEA has always been known as the kind of blue collar, federal law enforcement. So he kind of
[00:06:58] tried to push me that way and he had friends that still worked there. But unfortunately when I
[00:07:04] graduated from college in December of 91 DEA was on a hiring freeze. So I went back home to the
[00:07:12] Detroit Michigan area and Detroit police was hiring so I put my application there and got hired
[00:07:19] by the Detroit police department and February of 1993. Now when you say you are a rough and tumble
[00:07:27] kid it to me it seems like when I talked to people that had police's parents they they're either like
[00:07:33] really good on the straight narrow and they kind of rebellious. Where were you at were you
[00:07:38] somewhere in the middle? You know I kind of had a rebellious street to me but luckily I had a strong
[00:07:44] father and a strong grandfather and kind of kept me on the straight in narrow and my father was pretty
[00:07:52] tough on me and but he always supported me. He always went to my athletic events. It was there all the
[00:07:59] time. You know we put a foot up my ass if I needed but also you know was very loving and supporting
[00:08:06] you know I could still call my father today hey dad I need help he's like okay I'm on the way and
[00:08:12] a little more background my dad's father and actually my mother's father they both served and
[00:08:19] we'll work too and my dad's father he actually landed an Omaha Beach on D-Day and the second way
[00:08:27] even later got a silver star pushing through Germany. When you did you have brothers and sisters I
[00:08:35] have one sister she's four years younger than me but you were kind of the only son so your dad was
[00:08:41] at every sporting event that there was. Oh yes it coached me every sport but football
[00:08:49] so but to always even at grade school he would video of my games at the old VHS video camera
[00:08:57] and we sit down and watch the games after with him and he'd like you know Joey you know they called me
[00:09:03] he had my name is Joe too and my both grandfathers were Joe so they called me Joey. Joey you did
[00:09:08] this wrong you didn't have my mom would be like leave that poor kid alone. Where you how were you
[00:09:14] in school? Where you did you feel like you had to do good in school because your dad was kind of
[00:09:19] keeping an eye on you. Yeah you know I felt you know I needed to do you know well in school
[00:09:27] school things I would say I have you know I know what you're trying to say. Yeah you know
[00:09:35] I'm a pretty athletic guy but I've always had to work working life for things you know I was taught
[00:09:41] you work hard you put the effort in and if you didn't succeed at something you go back and look at it
[00:09:48] and you kind of become kind of analyze yourself okay what did I do right what did I do wrong
[00:09:53] what can I do better I've had a good example to you know put hard work in you know and most often
[00:10:01] hopefully it's gonna pay off and I just had a good example that way and you played you played
[00:10:07] college football as well yes and you how was that how was that did you guys went a lot did you
[00:10:14] lose a lot well lessons you take away from playing college ball you know I tell you what I tell
[00:10:18] everybody sports teach us a lot of lessons in life teaches you how to win how to lose how to be a
[00:10:25] team player all those things and I learned valuable lessons from sports now in college I went to a
[00:10:34] small school and so the mission called Adrian College we were the most winningest football team in
[00:10:39] Michigan in the 80s all divisions so we did really well when I was there we won two league championships
[00:10:49] and actually went to division three college national playoffs in 1988 so it was a good you know I
[00:10:57] was able to get my education and I excelled in college in football I knew I wasn't going to be the
[00:11:06] tallest guy you know bless my mom she's only like five foot so I better be strong and fast so
[00:11:11] lesson I picked up the weights and kind of blew up as soon as I started lifting so in college I was
[00:11:20] an all league player twice I was team captain team MVP and our league we had every week they
[00:11:28] listed an offensive defensive player the week I made that defensive player the week numerous times
[00:11:34] so you know it was a good experience you know you get to get the bond with those you know the
[00:11:38] people you play with and you learn life lessons and actually in college you know you finally get to
[00:11:44] do think you know classes that you're interested in your major and I did really well in college
[00:11:48] and actually and my major I had over three point average and stuff so and you said you transfer
[00:11:54] you switched from being and want to become like an athletic trainer into what sociology criminal
[00:12:01] justice what so you made the decision having to go go be a cop or something like that after
[00:12:06] my freshman year at the time at our school we didn't have a just specific criminal justice program
[00:12:15] so it was sociology with the emphasis on criminal justice and I continued sports and medicine
[00:12:20] as my minor degree so then you get done with that the federal the DA's not hiring as you said
[00:12:28] and so now you decide you're going to go and become a Detroit cop yes is it hard to apply for
[00:12:35] how strict is it it was easy to get into did you third generation you just get like a welcome
[00:12:40] map at the front door to get in there I wouldn't say that but when I showed to recruit or you know
[00:12:44] it was like you know they didn't give me any cut me any slack at all you know you got to go take
[00:12:49] your little eye test and this and that and you know you go through the process of course it's not
[00:12:53] is intense and his details of process getting hard federally busy you have to get security
[00:13:01] clearance you know but I you know they do a good job and you know I had decent credentials
[00:13:07] and you know luckily I just didn't get in a lot of trouble or didn't get caught so I didn't have
[00:13:14] bad things on my record so you know I got in fairly easy and showed up there and went through
[00:13:20] the academy and I'm not only like kind of a muscle head guy but I'm fairly intelligent and I
[00:13:27] graduated top academically in my class and got just lamp on knowledge and plaque and stuff
[00:13:31] a little genie lamp on there you know I say there's no great shakes you know my I guess my
[00:13:41] competition there wasn't as as a greatest level as the DEA academics but it was pretty good you
[00:13:47] know you get to teach a lot of a lot of things and in Detroit I grew up there on my life so I
[00:13:53] kind of knew when I was getting into and Detroit on the police department is kind of a bat
[00:13:58] tip of my fire you get to learn how to be the real police real fast you know it's kind of
[00:14:04] sink or swim and you immediately just go right out being like a beat cop in the streets and where
[00:14:09] with they did is they took the top people out of our class and put us in this unit called
[00:14:17] tactical service section we were a citywide unit that did crowd control also if there was a
[00:14:28] bearer-fated gun person we would do outer perimeter and we would work in areas where they were
[00:14:35] having problems certain precincts or the precincts got overrun with calls and we would go
[00:14:41] in flood the area and help the precincts out so it was kind of like a QRF like a quick reaction
[00:14:50] for us kind of like that in a way you know but you know we just answered the priority one
[00:14:57] in two calls like the shots fired things like that robberies and progress we took a little
[00:15:02] those higher level calls so it was pretty crazy and Detroit's kind of weird animal like I
[00:15:09] grew up in the east side so I mostly was the east side guy and when I became a TSS we worked the
[00:15:16] whole cities you might be in a couple different areas a couple different precincts as they call it
[00:15:21] in one day so when I grew up if I got out and chased somebody and jumped a couple of fences I knew
[00:15:26] where the hell I was you know beyond the west side bail out and I was pretty fast and I could jump
[00:15:32] fences pretty good so I could usually catch a lot of people and I was in shape so I jumped a
[00:15:37] couple fences I'd be in a yard holding a suspect at gunpoint and I wouldn't know where the hell I was
[00:15:44] at I'd be like radio, tech three I'm a couple blocks east of my original location
[00:15:51] next to the burnedout garage but the problem was like every third garage is burned out so
[00:15:58] so that was the day to day so you did that right out of the academy that seems like a strange
[00:16:04] thing to take someone that's brand new and put them in that kind of situation we're going into
[00:16:09] these tough calls all the time out of the gate that's trial by fire oh yes but which was good
[00:16:15] is a lot of the better officers worked there at tactical service section so you got to be trained
[00:16:20] and learned from some of the better police officers so you know you really got to learn the job
[00:16:26] fast and from some good individuals like how many people were on the team did you guys show up
[00:16:32] in like a freaking armored trucker we well each shift we had we ran two shifts a day shift
[00:16:38] and then a power shift the power shift was seven unlike the three in the morning those are like
[00:16:42] the busiest times day shift and power shifts so we've rolled out to eight to ten cars okay
[00:16:50] two people in a car you know so we would flood an area so it was good if you needed back up you
[00:16:55] needed help you know somebody usually was there fairly fast but it was it was intense and then
[00:17:04] after at the time my dad finished up he was on the full-time swatime in Detroit and was crazy
[00:17:12] about Detroit being a big city they didn't have a full-time swatime until 1986 which to me kind of
[00:17:18] blows my mind yeah that's crazy and he was on he was one of the original members on the team and then
[00:17:24] after three years of working up a troll type unit you could apply for a special unit or bureau
[00:17:31] they call them also and I tried out for the swat team and later made the swat team in my last year
[00:17:39] and the job I was on the full-time tactical team which was you know pretty pretty intense you
[00:17:45] got to do a lot of fun stuff and you didn't have to do a lot of paperwork but usually the
[00:17:50] sergeant the team you know he did the right up after the barricade gun person or unless you got
[00:17:55] into of course a shooting you would have to do a report and so so you went right from that
[00:18:00] tactical service section into the swat team yes how many years did you did you do the the
[00:18:06] tactical service section three years and then one year on the full-time swat team and then
[00:18:11] yes you did you shoot any did you fire your shot fire your weapon at all during those three years
[00:18:16] with the tactical service and not with TSS but on the swat team and it took a while to get hired by
[00:18:24] D.E.A. you know government sometimes it's hurry up and wait and I was sitting around it didn't
[00:18:31] hear anything that I had failed something and have time went by months went by and I get a call
[00:18:37] then they're like Mr. Perceini you still interested in a job but D.E.A. I said of course I have
[00:18:42] yeah we had lost your application we found it now oh man I'm like this has every information about me you know
[00:18:49] parents siblings every neighbor I've ever had you know I've had and the the process kind of
[00:18:56] really sped up so I'm like three months out from the academy and we go to a barricaded gunman
[00:19:04] and one of the precincts and Detroit and it's an ex-military person they have kind of mental problems
[00:19:12] and they would hold the neighborhood and their family at bay of shooting at them every so often so
[00:19:20] we respond and we begin take over from the precinct began negotiating with them and
[00:19:27] they start shooting at our armor personnel carrier through the window and
[00:19:31] it's starting to ramp up and we had some officer stationed in the backyard and the person goes out
[00:19:40] and is you know exchanging shooting at them but they don't have a clear shot at the suspect
[00:19:46] and they had a car in the driveway and my team was on a break we were like four or five houses
[00:19:52] down between houses and we had one of the suburbans we had with us and we had like half our gear on
[00:20:00] and they're like do not let them get mobile we feel they're trying they're going to
[00:20:05] might try to go for the car and then sure is crap they go for the car so I jumped in the passenger
[00:20:12] side of the suburban my buddy drives it jumps in the driver seat for like half dressed
[00:20:17] we just got our MP5 submachine gun strapped around us so we pulled behind the car to try to
[00:20:23] block him in and they start to ram us and we're like oh crap and by this time it was dark and then I see a
[00:20:30] muzzle flash through the rear window and they start shooting at us so I
[00:20:38] exited the vehicle tactically and my partner did and we opened up into the car and unfortunately had to
[00:20:46] dispatch the person and I was like wait and all this time for DEA and then finally I get an
[00:20:51] shooting but thank you know thank god it was a good shooting I didn't you know there was no drama
[00:20:55] with that but I was just like just my luck you know wait all this time and then I get in this
[00:20:59] you know critical incident how often were you guys as a SWAT team doing hits you know it varied
[00:21:09] sometimes in a month we four or five times we may be a barricade a gun person sometimes we
[00:21:16] would serve like felony warrants for more dangerous individuals once in a while we go out with
[00:21:22] narcotics if they were hitting a spot which they deemed was pretty dangerous and needed a little
[00:21:28] more trained units so we'd go and do that but you know did a lot of training tactical training a
[00:21:34] lot of shooting you know and as you can attest to the more you shoot the more efficient you know it's
[00:21:39] kind of a perishable skill so you know we got to do all those type of things so it was it was a good
[00:21:44] experience and you were just sporting that 1990s MP5 yes 9mm yeah I was like oh yeah you're in a vehicle
[00:21:56] and you have an MP5 and you know in the 90s for me in the SEAL teams you know we used the MP5
[00:22:03] but we thought it was cool until we had to shoot somebody that was more than you know 50 yards away
[00:22:08] and all of a sudden you think this is not a good weapon to have no or they have a ballistic vest
[00:22:12] the place is not going to hit yeah you know in the apillar and cars will stop that 9mm too yeah yeah
[00:22:19] that's I guess we've all transitioned away from the the MP5 now but damn that's an accurate easy to shoot
[00:22:27] weapon I think that's like sometimes people ask me about home defense weapons like for like for a
[00:22:33] female maybe and I think man an MP5 is not a bad call you're in the house you're only going to shoot
[00:22:38] someone that's in the house most likely you know so I think it's and it's so easy to shoot so accurate
[00:22:44] yes we you know you know there's very very little to almost no recoil on that weapon yeah
[00:22:49] and with a suppressor on them it's nothing nothing but that's a lot of experience that you had
[00:22:57] I mean just doing hits all the time in the 90s just that kind of experience I remember from
[00:23:03] the SEAL perspective in the 90s you know we looked at SWAT team especially you know city
[00:23:08] big urban center SWAT teams you guys were doing you guys were doing war call the time so the
[00:23:13] experience that you all had and and you know we would work with LA SWAT from time to time seals would
[00:23:20] work with LA SWAT and it was we were kind of who we were kind of envious of the fact that they
[00:23:28] got to go out and do the job and and you know same thing for you up there and Detroit in the 90s
[00:23:34] you just if you're in the military in the 90s chances were you weren't doing anything real yeah no so
[00:23:40] you get in that experience is that's a lot of experience to have in the 90s from that perspective
[00:23:49] so meanwhile you get done with that you spend that this year so how long were you on SWAT team for
[00:23:55] about a year year on the SWAT team and that's and you got picked up for the DEA after three months
[00:24:00] of being at the SWAT team is that what you said no I was there a little longer but it just took
[00:24:06] I got in that fatal shooting right three months before I was ready to start my academy day to
[00:24:11] order for the academy I I got hired with DEA in June of 1997 and and this was you like the DEA
[00:24:19] because they're and I actually never heard that the DEA was the blue collar of the feds I liked that
[00:24:25] I didn't know that before that's the reputation that they have on at the time you know things
[00:24:30] that things are changing and law enforcement now and everything and but at the time we were kind
[00:24:36] of the roughnecks so to speak so you get you get to go to what is it they have the DEA academy
[00:24:44] is that what they have yes it's in it was in in Quantico Virginia inside the Quantico military base
[00:24:51] and when I went through us in the FBI shared the same academy we since have our own academy
[00:25:00] that's right next to the FBI academy but we still share the gun ranges and driving track
[00:25:08] in gym with the FBI and how long is that pipeline you know it's like um like 16 18 week
[00:25:16] academy and what are you doing is it legal is it physical is it what are you doing it's a little bit
[00:25:24] of everything um where the police academy was more paramilitary DEA was more gentleman academy
[00:25:32] you know you didn't have to line up for inspection every day I see a speck will win down
[00:25:35] your you know you're uniform and getting you know the front lean and rest position and all that jazz
[00:25:39] um but it was very intense very academically challenging very physically challenge challenging
[00:25:47] we did a lot of shooting a lot of tactical training a lot of scenarios I was very impressed
[00:25:57] with it the biggest thing was your way from your family for four months as opposed when I
[00:26:01] went to the Detroit police academy he wasn't an overnight thing you come and go and stuff but
[00:26:07] it was a very very intense academy and then when I went through the DEA you couldn't go back
[00:26:16] to where you were hired from they had this thing with our administrator who's the person who runs DEA
[00:26:23] you couldn't go back because there might be a potential for corruption and to me and my if you're
[00:26:30] going to be cropped you're going to be cropped wherever you go through this so uh we you know
[00:26:38] three quarters of the academy they put a list out and a different spots opened and you know
[00:26:43] say you got 50 individuals in your academy class and there's 50 spots and of course it's where
[00:26:49] individuals are needed and of course DEA what the drugs come up for Mexico a lot of border spots
[00:26:54] so I'm like well I don't speak Spanish so maybe I won't have to go there
[00:26:58] um a lot of spots in your Calais you know big cities like that and you get to pick your
[00:27:05] top three choices you're not guaranteed necessarily to get any one of those and you can work
[00:27:10] it out with the class you know you get to sit there beforehand and okay there's so many spots
[00:27:15] here who wants to put in for one of these spots and you can kind of work it out and you submit
[00:27:19] your top three and like I said you're not guaranteed to get them any little spots and if you
[00:27:25] speak Spanish and there's some border spots you're probably going to go to the border and
[00:27:30] hi um so what'd you put for your top three slots that you wanted? I put Phoenix Arizona
[00:27:37] number one I had never been to Phoenix but was going to have to move and I was married at the time
[00:27:42] and my wife had had the time had dual custody with her children as a two boys young boys
[00:27:49] and she's going to have to move away from them so I kind of let her pick and then I put
[00:27:53] some Fort Lauderdale in Miami I was I had being from Michigan I had a lot of family that lived
[00:28:01] vacation seasonally and Florida and the winter months but I also had a grandmother
[00:28:07] that had a place in Arizona and then my wife at the time had a grandfather that lived there so
[00:28:14] put in for Phoenix Arizona and as long as you weren't like a butt head in the sedan and you
[00:28:20] know you more or less got one of your top three spots so I was very fortunate and that so I got that
[00:28:27] selected and got Phoenix and then what did you do when you show up you're a new guy or you new guy
[00:28:34] they call you new guy what are they calling you? Oh yeah I know you know f and new guy you know all kind of stuff
[00:28:40] you know and so I find out that I'm going to show up there I'm going to the
[00:28:47] clandestine laboratory task force group we're going to be doing moth labs now from Detroit
[00:28:53] I've never seen method in fedamine one time really um but this not really an urban city drug
[00:29:01] mess kind of more of a white trash drug we're saying you know in the city you know you have heroin
[00:29:07] or they call it a city heroin and of course cocaine crack cocaine marijuana and things like that
[00:29:14] so I just leave the academy and they're like Joe you're going back to the academy of for
[00:29:17] clan labs go on my gosh yet so I got stuck in the the clan lab group for my first four years but it
[00:29:25] was kind of good because it was a local task force ran out of the the Maricopa County Sheriff's office
[00:29:32] and you got to learn the basics of necotics and the investigations how to write a search
[00:29:38] warns how to deal with informants which is kind of our bread and butter and you get to learn
[00:29:45] the job so it really taught me how to become a DEA investigator and I would say on the low end
[00:29:56] of the estimate I've been in at least 500 method in fedamine labs and we you know we were on
[00:30:02] all the protective gear in it but we really don't know what the long term exposure is to
[00:30:05] the all these costic and hazardous chemicals are I had a neighbor who's nephew got involved in
[00:30:18] meth and he told he had been to prison and he got out of prison and when I met him the nephew had
[00:30:26] gotten out of prison and I met him and was talking to him and he was yeah I was I was just got out of
[00:30:31] prison he said and he told me he said when I tried crystal meth for the first time as soon as I tried it
[00:30:39] I realized that with the only thing I ever wanted to do for the rest of my life was more crystal meth
[00:30:43] and he stole everything from his mom everything else for grandma everything from his uncle
[00:30:49] everything from all of his friends ruined every relationship in San Diego and then
[00:30:55] went to somewhere else San Bernardino and made friends there and stole from all them and then did
[00:30:59] that all across the country until he finally wound up in Texas and you know that's where he finally
[00:31:04] got rolled up and sent to prison but that that that meth thing is freaking crazy huh you know it's
[00:31:09] crazy you know you know these drugs are crazy especially these harder drugs like as you kind of said
[00:31:14] he controls their whole life you know and most of the labs are smaller we call them mom and pop
[00:31:20] labs are cooking ounces that's cute you know you know it's you know it's they make enough to get
[00:31:25] their own for free and you know and sell a little bit to their friends you know so they get there
[00:31:32] as for free and you know they're cooking in these houses with these little kids you know and everything
[00:31:38] is off-gassing into the you know into the air getting into the carpet and walls and everything else
[00:31:44] so we started bringing child protective services with us when we would do meth and fedamine
[00:31:49] lab warrants and they would bring the kids to the hospital and when they would test them you know
[00:31:56] high percentage of what test positive for meth and fedamine just because the staff you know
[00:32:01] was in the carpet and the atmosphere you know it just breaks my heart you know me having a daughter
[00:32:07] you know these little kids involved and then not only would they get charged with the meth lab
[00:32:12] and manufacturing they would get charged with child abuse from CPS also so you would do these
[00:32:19] investigations you're you're getting human intelligence that's telling you hey I get my I get my
[00:32:25] meth from this person over here then you find out where that person lives then you track them for a
[00:32:30] little while figure out you know where they're doing suspicious activity and then you do a hit on it
[00:32:35] how does that work yes that's one of the means with an informant hey you know you know
[00:32:41] informants you know summer will try to work off charge a summer just paid informants and they go
[00:32:44] around and that's what they do you know so-and-so is manufacturing meth here you know I've saw
[00:32:50] you know these class where items I saw this part of the cooking procedure I saw these chemicals
[00:32:56] you know and then you do you know some more background and then you do you know some investigations
[00:33:01] of aliens and use kind of some of our techniques that we use to you know kind of make sure and
[00:33:09] evaluate the informant and we also get information from different places as well these chemicals you know
[00:33:16] Joe blow is buying you know keeps buying you know every month so many pounds of red phosphorus so
[00:33:20] we found the eyedine crystals or the different stores when you get by the coal pills the
[00:33:26] pseudo-faggender or a faggender tablets over the counter they would kind of some stores would work with us
[00:33:32] and they would get license plates so we do a work-up and you know find out where these people live
[00:33:39] they'll start an investigation and then we got enough probable cause for a search warrant we would hit
[00:33:45] these locations you know because of the the dangers of meth labs a lot of times you don't know
[00:33:52] what the atmosphere was so you when you rated it you would have to go in with full
[00:33:57] SCBA self-contained breathing apparatus but you didn't know with the environment in oxygen level was in
[00:34:03] the houses and of course you got this big tank on your back and it's kind of cumbersome and a lot
[00:34:09] of local swathes where clan lab trained for tactics so there were little smaller tactical
[00:34:16] bottles you could use so a lot of unknowns and you know one of our investigative techniques you
[00:34:23] go through and garbage cans when they put it on the curb so a lot of these meth people
[00:34:29] to know that we would pull trash so they would save every bit of lab trash they ever had in one room
[00:34:35] so you're missing you know your missing mixing acids and bay bases together and things are off-cass
[00:34:40] and so it's not the very safe environment to say the least. What's the paid informant?
[00:34:47] um they're actually there's almost like a professional informant but it's like for money
[00:34:55] seizure and drug seizures we would pay them money so they'd go around and work and travel
[00:35:02] sometimes from city to city just to make money as an informant you know and at different times when
[00:35:08] you know budgets and we had good money and you know they got a certain percentage of a cash seizure
[00:35:15] or acid seizure you know they can make some fairly decent money and what these are just guys
[00:35:20] sort of off the street or do they apply for that job or it's really you know you have to fill
[00:35:26] a lot of package for a person that wants to be a confidential source of course you have to run
[00:35:31] their criminal history make sure they have no act of warrants and you know you have to
[00:35:37] supervise them pretty tight and you know some people get improved for work as informant some
[00:35:44] don't just because they're a criminal history and their stuff is just so bad you know so it's
[00:35:51] you know it's a catch-22 you know you can't get a choir choir person a choir boy you know
[00:35:56] to catch people but it's it's a fine line you have you have to manage it well
[00:36:02] and as you're doing this and you see you went into over 500 meth labs in how many years was that
[00:36:09] four years and four years so that's like you know up hitting a meth lab every two or three maybe four
[00:36:16] days going into those things did you feel like hey they're we're making a dent or sometimes
[00:36:23] you just feel like we're just overwhelmed and this is we could keep doing this forever
[00:36:28] it got to the point where it was bad for a while you almost felt overwhelmed but there was so many
[00:36:34] and it was so easy to get the precursor chemicals to manufacture a meth infetamine here in the
[00:36:41] United States so then we started as a whole DEA we started cracking down into the companies that
[00:36:50] made the a federal tablets or the pseudo-fedron pills which is one of the primary precursor
[00:36:56] chemicals of meth infetamine and would track where their shipping in made him harder to get and
[00:37:03] that's why you probably see like if you buy any coal medication that has pseudo-fedron you
[00:37:08] got to buy it you have to get it from behind the counter now right this people were going in just you
[00:37:12] know buy in two stealing tool two boxes and they call it like smurfing pills and they would get
[00:37:18] enough to make you know how much meth infetamine they wanted to make so that started really
[00:37:24] putting we saw that started putting a dent into it you know and course then all then
[00:37:30] originally when I was working these labs of course there was a lot of meth infetamine coming
[00:37:36] up for Mexico but it wasn't that pure so a lot of the true tweakers did not want it they wanted
[00:37:42] that real pure glass 98 99 you know percent pure meth infetamine which was homegrown made
[00:37:53] and then once the we you know cracked down the precursors in harder to get here
[00:38:00] Mexico started picking up their game and started making the real pure meth infetamine down in
[00:38:06] Mexico and sending it up through the border so that means you were dealing with the cartel the
[00:38:10] big drug cartels um yes a lot and especially when I worked in Phoenix you know course that's
[00:38:18] what is you know the Southwest is controlled by the Mexican drug cartels um do you have any you know
[00:38:27] big memorable operations or that you did that you were part of? He yes um like I said most of the
[00:38:36] labs were like mom and pop tweaker labs but I was able to do a couple of pretty big we call
[00:38:44] a Mexican national labs where they're making multiple possible pounds at one time and
[00:38:52] um the Sheriff's Office had some information that uh that's a couple guys came in they wanted
[00:38:59] to work for money and they do this big Mexican national lab west of Phoenix in an area called
[00:39:08] Westbrane Ranch you know we're like okay I went with a I went with another partner to see what they
[00:39:13] had to say you know a lot of times a lot of things can be BS and people over hype and over blow it up
[00:39:18] you know so we go out there and you know hey this is group of these Mexican nationals you know they're
[00:39:24] making you know 30, 40, 50 pounds in math that is time they're cooking out in this real
[00:39:29] rule location you know so we get a work up and start doing some investigation and identify
[00:39:38] where the people are living in the city and we have an informant just willing and knows when
[00:39:44] they're out there cooking you know so we're building up a plan and you know of course it's on
[00:39:49] the mill nowhere so there's no address of this place there's a parcel numbers you're getting like
[00:39:54] a GPS grid coordinates did this place and that's what's on the search warrant you know you know
[00:40:00] how are we gonna hit this place in a cooking or are we gonna do an air assault or what are we going
[00:40:05] to do so we finally it got up and um got close okay they said they're gonna cook this weekend
[00:40:12] and what's the time for him on all this how long does this take is it is it weeks is it days is
[00:40:18] it months it all depends it varies I think this one in particular um I think we were working on it for a
[00:40:25] couple months so the informant says I think they're gonna cook this weekend is it okay we'll get ready
[00:40:32] so you know we're preparing and getting you know as much information as we have it typed up in the
[00:40:38] search warrant and everything and we knew there was a property close to them which the guy was kind
[00:40:44] of involved and if they were gonna run from the lab location they more than likely they were
[00:40:50] gonna go high that they're that residents you know so then informant calls me okay they're going
[00:40:57] out and buying a bunch of ice so one of the processes of cooking method and you got to start adding
[00:41:02] ice to things and cool it down so we knew okay they're cooking they're almost they're getting close to
[00:41:09] done so we spent up the team we've put an affidab at what the the informant says and we get it
[00:41:16] signed by a judge and we were working with the sheriff's office at the time and it was decided
[00:41:21] we're not gonna do an air assault we're gonna convoy in there and you know this is a real
[00:41:26] location you know in your convoy you know when a desert type environment you're kicking up
[00:41:31] dust and stuff they can see you coming from five miles away how big of a team are you bringing
[00:41:34] and this is like an assault team yeah we're bringing the the the the the Maricopa County
[00:41:42] SWAT team you know it's probably 20 something individuals are lab team you know we probably got
[00:41:51] 10 individuals or so and then we're bringing chemists and has them at and everything out so it's a
[00:41:56] pretty good force big convoy big convoy lot of dust he does stuff so of course the plan was
[00:42:04] the SWAT team is gonna hit the lab location do you put a recon element out at all or just do
[00:42:10] an aerial or nothing we had an aerial prior but we didn't have time to get people light in there
[00:42:17] late in there to do it we would have liked that to happen but it just wasn't feasible with the situation
[00:42:23] so of course the SWAT team hits it hey we got a huge lab up cooking but nobody's here
[00:42:30] I like oh shit so the group I was with we go to you know we so we let me catch that so the
[00:42:39] SWAT team hits it they find the lab and there's no people there yes it's up and cooking okay so
[00:42:48] like I said earlier I said if they run they're probably gonna go to this other gentleman's house
[00:42:52] so we go to that house and we hear some noise and some scurrying in the house and
[00:43:02] we hear like a lady like calling for help so we're like damn they're in there
[00:43:10] so eggnets and circumstances we enter the house and they're all trying to hide in this back
[00:43:16] bedroom got one guys halfway up the chimney like guys lying in bed with his muddy boots and everything
[00:43:22] all like he's sleeping and laying on the couch and I'm like really guys we're gonna fall for this
[00:43:28] so we brought him back over to the lab and you know processed the lab and then I'd be in a
[00:43:34] nice ice lab they think they had like 50 pounds of methane fedemine in solution
[00:43:39] and then at later led to they end up cooperating and then hit another big lab in south
[00:43:46] Phoenix and that individual he also was running labs in Riverside California too
[00:43:55] so he was wanted you know by Riverside Sheriff in this and that we end up hitting them and
[00:44:00] getting a big lab at that time when we make entry with the SWAT team and that's
[00:44:07] this guy was living on a horse property at horses and stuff. Where was this this guy was in Phoenix
[00:44:11] as well. Yes in our area. Yeah south Phoenix actually so this guy was a legit
[00:44:17] like yeah horses and a ranch of some kind. Oh yes I was doing well. In head of ranch in
[00:44:25] Riverside too. Yeah because I kind of get the impression you know when you talk about like the
[00:44:28] mom and pop labs that a lot of people are just kind of getting away with what they can
[00:44:32] and then they eventually get busted. Yeah they're broke but occasionally you have somebody that
[00:44:36] broke as a joke and these people they're they're in it for making the money and yeah it's
[00:44:43] this guy who we hit in south Phoenix he actually taught the other people in the lab how to cook.
[00:44:52] So yeah we we go in there and he's in the back cooking and he's cooking with a 22-liter
[00:44:57] flask. It's a big triple night flask. It's a good size flask about size of a basketball little bigger.
[00:45:02] So when a swat team goes in he takes the flask and smashes on the ground. But of course
[00:45:09] you take the samples there you know he's not gonna you know we figure out what's in there and
[00:45:15] so yeah I need you know we found some you know method that name in the house and everything
[00:45:20] we're like what's this? Oh that is feed for the horses and that's not feed for the damn horses come on.
[00:45:25] What happens to these guys you go then you wrap them up immediately go to jail.
[00:45:33] Wrap them up he went to jail you know they did some search warrants on his place in Riverside
[00:45:39] in California and then we and died at him and you know put him in prison for a while.
[00:45:44] How long is a while? Like this guy his name was Tara Thomas to Harrow Sanchez I think he got like 10 years.
[00:45:50] Hmm so he's probably out by he probably listening to this right now. Yeah probably perhaps you know
[00:45:57] you know but this lab oh hell this is back and who this one?
[00:46:02] 99. So yeah foreshare yeah he's back out. You know I forgot to ask you this when you got in that
[00:46:09] shooting back when you're with the Detroit what did you have any lessons learned from that about the way it
[00:46:16] happened about what you what how your reaction was did you do something well did you do something bad
[00:46:21] did you feel like you're training work did you feel like your training didn't work like how how was that
[00:46:25] experience that yes that's a very good question with all the training we had you know the different
[00:46:32] scenarios and differentiated gun people I just reacted with my training you know I saw the
[00:46:38] muzzle fly as I knew it was gunfire and you know I just did what I had to do to neutralize you know
[00:46:45] to stop the threat. So the training you had worked 100% you know I didn't even think you know I
[00:46:52] didn't even don't even remember looking through my sights I know I did you know you get that
[00:46:58] perceptual narrowing you know when you're in a fighter flight or a gunfight you know either
[00:47:02] eyesight increases you're hearing decreases you start so you fight motor skills so you felt all that
[00:47:08] stuff yes what about the you you were the passenger and another guy was driving yes did he get hit
[00:47:14] was he okay no he was okay he he fired like four or five shots and I had my MP five on full automatic
[00:47:22] and I just fired bursts into the weapon ran dry damn going full auto huh yeah I was like hey
[00:47:30] I'm gonna end this as quick as possible you know you people get all these you know lucky shots you
[00:47:35] chase and he's you know perpetrators whatever and they're running from you and they take the gun
[00:47:40] and shoot it over their head and hit you you know dead between eyes yeah yeah what about doing all
[00:47:47] these you know doing all these hits over the years with the DA down in the Phoenix area you know
[00:47:53] you you obviously are starting to pack away some good some good you know methodologies and
[00:47:59] and thought processes as you're going to do these things like all your big takeaways as you
[00:48:04] you as you developed as of you know as a agent I always was very tactically proficient and
[00:48:15] I think one of my four days in strong points as an agent was being able to deal with people
[00:48:22] and that's what I I suggest that anybody who gets in federal law enforcement I would advise them to be a
[00:48:28] local law enforcement officer first but you get to learn the job you get to learn how to deal with
[00:48:33] people and I happen to be very good at dealing with informants and I could work in formants well
[00:48:40] what do you think was that what made you good at it? One I think my street smart's growing up in Detroit
[00:48:48] you know and being able to talk to the lingo and look the part you know and life
[00:48:54] unfortunately a lot of times when you first go in a situation especially criminals they're going to
[00:49:00] size you up they're going to say this this individual look like they know what they're doing
[00:49:06] can I trust this person you know but a lot of times these people that are working for us they're
[00:49:11] risking their life and they have to feel confident that you're going to do your best to protect them
[00:49:17] and I also learned never promise somebody something you can't deliver you know don't promise
[00:49:24] them well you know you work a couple weeks and you get a couple you know I can make all your
[00:49:28] charges go away it's not up it's not up to the agents you know you have to bring their
[00:49:33] cooperation attention to the prosecutor which then brings it to the judge and you know those decisions
[00:49:39] are made then and also treat people like a people a person you know you don't have to start you
[00:49:48] know I'll talking down to somebody you know I'm the big bad fad and you know you're just the
[00:49:53] lonely pion drug dealer you don't do that you know I start off giving everybody respect
[00:50:00] now if you want to go sideways we'll go sideways but I'm going to give you the benefit of the
[00:50:05] doubts at first you know we're in formance too you've got to be care you know they're in formance
[00:50:11] they're they're criminals you know you know that they can turn their back on you too
[00:50:17] so you've got to you know you never can trust them 100% you do your best and you know and
[00:50:24] you lay the you know lay the ground rules and everything and then you know you manage your
[00:50:29] informants you know going on from there but you know being you know having a good
[00:50:36] informant you're kind of like you know they're they're confident you know there's therapist everything
[00:50:41] else you know you're phone's gonna be ringing in middle of the night you're always going to
[00:50:45] want to talk to you you know because it's girlfriend left the left home he's you know they're doing
[00:50:49] this you know there you know you thinking about making a bad you know you need dance or
[00:50:53] little calls and a lot of people don't like to do that but if you want to do well at the job
[00:51:00] at a high level it's kind of things you have to do you gotta put the work in how many sources
[00:51:04] would you be running out of time I come in people would you be working with how many informants
[00:51:08] I'm usually I kept anywhere from three to five informants at anyone given time
[00:51:16] what what is the trajectory of their lives look like I mean do they they end up they just do that
[00:51:22] to lay eventually get caught killed do they do it until they eventually you know do something
[00:51:26] that sends them to jail do they ever get out of that life it's kind of a mixture you know some
[00:51:34] do it you know they think they're slick and they're gonna play both sides and do they get caught
[00:51:38] they go to prison you know some get killed you know they get found out you know we do everything
[00:51:44] we can to protect their identity and some do it for a while or some are you know trying to help
[00:51:49] their legal situation or a family member situation or just doing it for money and you know eventually
[00:51:56] move on and get on with their lives and get back into some normalcy of life you know and when I was
[00:52:05] a de agent and a police officer you know I didn't gauge my success on how many people I
[00:52:10] arrested and this and that I gauge my success on how many people did I help they get their life together
[00:52:18] you know just be as a person you know gets caught up in drugs or some crime activities
[00:52:23] it doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad person you know they made some bad decisions
[00:52:28] so I gauge my success mostly and hey how many people this year did I help?
[00:52:35] Yeah that's you must start to really understand the way people operate too especially dealing
[00:52:42] with all these people and you're hearing from them all the time like the insight that you get
[00:52:47] into interacting with people are they they're showing up they're most of them though
[00:52:51] they do they most of the informants have some kind of criminal background and that's how they
[00:52:55] end up in this situation most of them do yes okay so at what point or where were you when
[00:53:04] September 11th happened? I was in my house in Phoenix beginning ready to go to the gym
[00:53:11] because I never knew how long I was going to work so I always been into working out and keep my
[00:53:16] stuff fit so I'd get up and work out before work and I'm sitting there watching the news and
[00:53:21] when the first plane hit said a small plane just hit the world trade center so then of course
[00:53:27] we're all you know people who grew to the TV then the second plane hit and they're like this is not a
[00:53:33] small plane and you know of course all the chaos and everything that went on that day I ended up
[00:53:38] going to the gym and you know work you know hey you know we don't know where we're going to get hit from
[00:53:44] next you know so it's all hands on deck and you know you know you had to plane hit the Pentagon
[00:53:51] and our DEA headquarters is right across the expressway from there so people went off
[00:53:56] and that side saw the plane smashed into the Pentagon and so if things were in chaos for a minute
[00:54:02] like to say the least and did they did they they start to think about how to utilize the DEA for
[00:54:08] immediately trying to assist like the national effort did it change I'm saying I guess I'm
[00:54:15] asking did it change like you're immediate life your immediate job or was it okay well we still
[00:54:22] got to you know arrest people that are making math so you're going to continue doing that or was
[00:54:27] it some kind of change what kind of happen that's one of the change that happened pretty fast was
[00:54:32] when we when we debrief in informant there's different things you have to put in there like
[00:54:38] different blocks you know what is the drug related activity they have known right now what
[00:54:44] is the non drug related activity and then they started a terrorist related activity
[00:54:50] did you know you know any people do interrius related activities and being in the clan lab scene
[00:54:59] so a lot of the individuals who sold and made money out of the effedrant in pseudo-fedron
[00:55:08] were middle eastern individuals so of course you know they were like you know you know
[00:55:13] get all your middle eastern informants and see if they have any terrorist activity and we had a lot
[00:55:19] DEA had a lot of middle eating you know with the drugs in the pseudo-fedron so
[00:55:23] FBI then wanted to come over started to brief in our informants you know about terror
[00:55:27] it terrorist related activities within a much of a connection there was a more than just trying to make
[00:55:32] money there was some you know there was some you know somewhere you know sending money back
[00:55:38] and things like that and you know when the military first went over to Afghanistan you know we
[00:55:45] had some intel we didn't know you know all the you know Ben Laden had his trained facilities over there
[00:55:49] but when the US military went over there they shortly realized that the Taliban in those
[00:55:56] and surgeon groups were making their money for their legal territories by the sale and
[00:56:02] reduction of heroin and that's one of the first questions I get why is DEA I was DEA over in
[00:56:07] Afghanistan so and also the the military they knew they were not subject matter experts on that
[00:56:15] so that's when they reached out to the DEA hey guys gals we need help here and we didn't have a kind of
[00:56:24] tactical team that was up to speed to do this at the time years prior to that we had an operation
[00:56:33] called operations snow cap where we were in Columbia and other cocaine manufacturing destinations
[00:56:42] and hitting Coca-labs you know with you know partner forces in this and that so DEA had to start
[00:56:49] up a team so they used some of the individuals that we were working snow cap and developed this
[00:56:55] fast team this foreign deployed advisory and support team to help the military and mentor our
[00:57:05] partner force over there because we really don't have over there you know any like criminal authority
[00:57:13] so in the Afghans they were behind the time so we went over you know the military you know they
[00:57:17] got plenty of trigger pullers and of course we can pull triggers too but they went for expertise on
[00:57:23] investigations and how do we handle these how do we process these lab because in Afghanistan even though
[00:57:30] heroin production is crazy the the penalties for getting caught manufacturing drugs over
[00:57:35] there are very very severe and we can actually take somebody off the battlefield a lot longer
[00:57:42] you know for drug related things then just for say you know you you know him somebody up
[00:57:47] for tactical questioning and then they're back directly on the battlefield you know but the issue is you
[00:57:53] know we're working with US and coalition special ops teams over there but most of these labs are
[00:58:01] well behind enemy lines and that's their money you know so they're going to fight like hell to keep
[00:58:06] them so you have to be up to speed to run with these you know these special ops guys you know so
[00:58:12] at first they just had a you know put a solicitation out hey you know this is what the mission is
[00:58:20] going to be we need some volunteers you know some of the guys been that done that in the past
[00:58:24] and maybe were special ops guys but at the current time maybe they weren't in the best shape
[00:58:30] and they would get over there and we're having problems keeping up got it so that's when
[00:58:36] our fast team institute a selection process and that selection process they took various
[00:58:44] areas of selection from different special ops teams and put a selection together you know
[00:58:50] and at what point did you hear about that and at what point did you volunteer for it
[00:58:58] I knew the fast team was going on you know I started hearing rumbles and rub out it
[00:59:05] in 2005 time frame but the problem is in the field the basic agents didn't really know
[00:59:16] was going on with this fast team I had a buddy that went to the fast team he was
[00:59:23] Marine Corps officer and I was pushing on with my career and I've always no matter what I've done
[00:59:29] I've tried to go to the highest level whatever I did in life so you know I was just kind of like
[00:59:36] sitting around and like hey you know what is fast team doing were you still in Phoenix at this time
[00:59:41] yes I was so you were in Phoenix from like 1998 1998 all so 1997 and until I actually got selected
[00:59:53] on the fast team and October 2009 so you there for a while you have over 10 years experience
[01:00:04] as a DEA agent on the ground doing and was that whole 10 years was that all that time doing the
[01:00:12] math lab stuff the first four years and then I went on to a conspiracy group where we were
[01:00:18] higher level traffickers I worked on a task force with a lot of local officers when you're
[01:00:27] what's the conspiracy group all of a sudden it sounds cool we know that right you know he's
[01:00:32] exactly a lot of things are my sounds real cool you know if we have you know real cool acronyms
[01:00:37] and everything else you know you go you're going after mid level to higher level dealers
[01:00:43] and still mathematically or they're dealing everything math cocaine marijuana I'm okay
[01:00:50] heroin so you had a mixture of Phoenix is kind of a weird animal you're kind of close to the
[01:00:56] border so it's a trans shipment point so a lot of the drugs are coming in coming up from the
[01:01:02] southwest border into cities like Tucson and Phoenix in their states they're they only stay
[01:01:09] their short period of time and those drugs are picked up and sent out to the east coast you
[01:01:14] got to be like on your game to get stuff you know you might have a stash house loaded up one
[01:01:19] day and it's gone the next so you had to really be on your game you know and move fast to do these
[01:01:26] things so you know I worked in a combination of different groups and I call my buddy and I'm like hey
[01:01:33] what's how you guys doing there are you guys just doing training or you guys going out and doing
[01:01:38] missions he's also Joe you know we're you know working with some of the best units in the
[01:01:44] words this is when you're asking what your buddies about fast yes okay I got it you know
[01:01:48] what are you guys doing you know we're training working with some of the best units in the world
[01:01:52] world you know we're doing things what you would think DEA would be doing you know we're doing
[01:01:58] this high level stuff and at the time every year they would put out a solicitation for solid
[01:02:06] first to go through the fast selection and you need it to be at least a GS12 so that
[01:02:13] usually takes about three to four years to get to a GS level 12 and they wanted people who
[01:02:20] had experience of how to be a DEA agent so you and then you put in for the selection and then
[01:02:25] if you get picked you know you go through tryouts and I was 39 when I put in for selection
[01:02:32] you know as we get older we don't recover as fast as we once did some people yes
[01:02:39] if you're a pension you're you're a potential for injury sometimes increases so
[01:02:44] I knew I wouldn't quit anything I was just worried about my old body you know holding up I
[01:02:49] got a lot of miles out of you know 50,000 miles is kind of up and you know there's a lot of
[01:02:53] different swimming and different testing and different things and you know so I started training
[01:03:00] and and you're still doing your job working the conspiracy stuff this time I was on a task
[01:03:07] for a screw but what's the task force group there we were task force on the west side of the
[01:03:13] city and we worked with various west side police departments and they were all sworn in as
[01:03:24] federal task force agents so they had the full powers like a BDA agent you could you know do
[01:03:29] investigations over state lines and everything and we were hitting a lot of like big marijuana
[01:03:34] hits, meth hits, cocaine hits so I was still yes doing my full-time job and then have to
[01:03:40] get ready and train for the selection any good between on the conspiracy thing like what's the
[01:03:47] biggest people you ever rolled up when you're doing the conspiracy gig we had one case this one group
[01:03:57] and they were an African American group they were had people out of Detroit, Ed Lanta and Los Angeles
[01:04:08] and Phoenix they would get their large amounts of shipments of marijuana from the Phoenix and
[01:04:15] Tucson area now we're talking large amounts I'm talking they would buy 23,000 pounds of marijuana at a time
[01:04:25] and we had in front of Mexico yes well they buy it in Phoenix they don't the marijuana came
[01:04:33] up from Mexico you know of course you buy it in south west is a lot cheaper than you bring it
[01:04:39] out east and you can sell it from a double the price so there's a lot of money involved we have
[01:04:43] an informant you know these guys are rich and they have this huge place in this gated community
[01:04:48] and Scott's Dale and all these truckers that are driving for them and everything so it's full on
[01:04:53] you know full on enterprise you know but you you gotta be kind of suspect a little bit you know
[01:04:59] yeah this is a little far fetched you know so the informant says okay they're meeting they're
[01:05:08] gonna meet their sources supply and they're gonna do a deal and I'm gonna be at the house
[01:05:14] so like okay we set up we have a general area where we think they're in nice house is
[01:05:24] and so we got some people set up in that vicinity and they go into this residence
[01:05:30] in Phoenix and they pull a van in the garage we're like okay this looks good
[01:05:36] so the van leaves the garage and informant says okay they picked up
[01:05:41] so sure a shit they're found a van and we take it this gated community in Scott's Dale
[01:05:48] well you gotta you know get keyed in and buzzed in and everything and we
[01:05:53] sit on the house and get it identified where they're at and see people coming and going
[01:05:59] and they follow them out and sure a shit they go to a warehouse too or there's a semi truck
[01:06:04] oh like oh it's on and pop and now so we get enough for a search warrant for the house
[01:06:14] and the warehouse and hit it and get pretty good large amount of marijuana
[01:06:20] and during this time one of the we follow one of the guys and to the airport and you know
[01:06:26] work kind of short numbers we got people all over the place and I'm by myself following this guy
[01:06:31] and it's very hard to do surveillance by yourself without getting burnt you know without
[01:06:36] them seeing you and I don't know how I pulled it off but I did so what are you wearing
[01:06:43] just street clothes just street clothes you know I did some of those surveillance and counter
[01:06:48] surveillance and like dressed up and you know trying to look like a bomb in this in that man I
[01:06:54] I was horrible I was like the worst I was like the worst undercover person ever I don't know
[01:07:00] it seems like you would have a similar issue since you're pretty jacked you know you just
[01:07:06] stand out and a crowd yes you know so you just kind of you know if you were following me I'm
[01:07:11] 100% gonna know you're not gonna sneak around following me is not happening yeah I'm
[01:07:17] foot spales is very hard you know so you're you're in a vehicle you're trying to stay far back
[01:07:20] as you can and everything and some of I pulled it off and as the person got out of the
[01:07:25] let they let the person out to go into the terminal I some I got one hand a snap the photo of
[01:07:30] Amanha I pulled it off but I did not happen to be the main guy so we ended up getting the
[01:07:37] again I'm getting a picture of him and we didn't know you know who he was at the time or not
[01:07:42] and he was flying back to LA you know so we headed you know get some people in custody and then
[01:07:49] get the person identified who dropped him off and she had some prior crammer history so we knew this
[01:07:58] case was you know bigger and tied into all these states and everything so I told my partner I said
[01:08:04] hey we're gonna go visit this lady tomorrow we're gonna bluffer and we're gonna say hey you know
[01:08:15] you know we got you taking this person yada yada yada yada you know and you're
[01:08:21] helped in the furtherance of this conspiracy to their drug traffic and organization you have
[01:08:25] some criminal history in the past you know you know we're gonna potentially look at and
[01:08:29] die to you and maybe season your vehicle and my partner had the time she goes it'll never work
[01:08:34] I said watch you just trying to get her to roll just get her to roll I said watch so we
[01:08:40] not gonna door so so you're wearing plain clothes plain clothes you got like a badge around the neck
[01:08:46] and the chain you know like TV and the pair jeans you want to look as unintimulating as
[01:08:53] possible if you want to look intimidating like what's your what's your like what's your character
[01:08:58] what character you're going into just kind of this kind of low key intimidating enough with
[01:09:03] you know you're you know federal law enforcement you know you're not playing around but you know
[01:09:08] you're trying to you know you've got to build rapport with these people too you know
[01:09:13] you know to try to get some common interest and my partner at the time your partner was
[01:09:19] may say in this sandal never works she's like I don't think this will work Joe she was some
[01:09:23] a new agent and I said just watch I said watch him sometimes who works sometimes it doesn't
[01:09:29] we got like a 50 50 here would give it a try and you don't worry that you're gonna give away
[01:09:34] the fact that you're on to him you know at this point you know we had you know significant
[01:09:41] on to people in custody okay so you know you know they know we're on to them at what extent
[01:09:48] they don't know you know but I tell people too you can't make cases sitting behind your deck
[01:09:52] at that's all the time you got to get out there and shake the bush so she's kind of naysaying
[01:09:58] me and this person ended up being a topless dancer one of the gentleman clubs and Phoenix where
[01:10:08] there's a lot of the the Mexican sources go hang out there and a lot of the people from
[01:10:12] out of town come in there to find sources and this person this informant she was known to dates
[01:10:20] a lot of these out of town drug dealers and she would hook them up with the sources of supply
[01:10:27] so we go talk to her and not gonna door and you can tell by her face she's like oh shit
[01:10:35] and we just lay it out and I said this is what can happen to you this is okay I cooperate what
[01:10:40] do you want to know so we started working with her was wrong yeah he had also you know I guess
[01:10:50] she didn't get lucky sometimes and I got lucky then so we ended up using her and going back
[01:10:58] and they kept coming to town but of course they moved their operation to another spot and then
[01:11:04] we were able to investigate and look at all these other seizures that happened in different states
[01:11:10] and tie them all together to these people you know interviewing actually interviewing the truck
[01:11:16] drivers got their sources to supply you know pulled receipts from hotels and and plain things at
[01:11:23] different time when they were supposed to do these deals and were able to tie everything together
[01:11:30] and some of these people we had never caught them red handed with drugs but just what testimony
[01:11:38] by the informants putting the things together by pulling receipts we ended up hammering this group
[01:11:48] and getting them all charged and indicted when a lot of these other groups couldn't do it
[01:11:53] and I actually helped my partner get her GS13 because at DEA are kind of journeyman levels
[01:12:00] GS13 and you have to do so many things you know you have to have these complicated cases
[01:12:06] and or dinner wire tap or did some undercover so I actually helped him get her 13 and I was already
[01:12:14] on the fast team when they went and did the take down but they said just to see these people's faces
[01:12:19] like oh shit you got all the sun made oh crap and we used her to do quite a bit of other good cases too
[01:12:28] did you ever do any undercover work yes I did something what was that like
[01:12:34] how and everybody thinks it's intense everybody thinks that you need to look like a drug
[01:12:39] guy to do undercover now kind of the contrary like a DEA we're dealing with people are in
[01:12:47] to make money so a lot of these people look like business people and it's kind of as long as you talk
[01:12:52] to talk you know you're alright so undercover I've reversed chemicals and equipment to make
[01:13:00] meth under cover I bought meth and fedamine in larger amounts I bought heroin and then
[01:13:09] there's an individual which a lot of people have heard their name before they used to be a
[01:13:15] famous mob hitman Sam with the vulgar vinyl he was out in Phoenix and witness protection
[01:13:21] but still doing bad activities so they actually put me under cover he actually had this group
[01:13:28] of kids out there they were in the MMA and they were selling ecstasy in steroids and his group
[01:13:35] ago around and they would beat up like they would pick up minorities and jump him like five on one
[01:13:40] kind of like a one percent or motorcycle gang thing and they put me in there to buy steroids
[01:13:46] from these kids so I ended up buying steroids from these kids and then later led to Sammy the
[01:13:52] bull getting to additional legal problems well where is he out right now I'm not sure
[01:13:58] we's at the moment that's crazy when you're doing these undercover ones that you're talking
[01:14:05] about are you staying under cover for a long period of time or you basically going under cover for
[01:14:10] two hours to go meet these guys buy some shit and then roll out did you ever do these guys
[01:14:16] it seems like they're going under cover for extended period of time that's called like a deep
[01:14:20] cover operation those don't happen that much anymore you know there's a lot of risk involved
[01:14:25] then there you know so you know there was some like some of the pseudo cases were like I
[01:14:31] played a role for like months at a time but a lot of it was done over the phone and stuff but
[01:14:36] most of them was like you know you're meeting with the guy you know you know if you're this
[01:14:41] hour or two you know you're under cover role and then you're moving on to the next thing you know
[01:14:48] in the biggest thing when people think if you know you're undercover and a suspect are you
[01:14:54] the police you're supposed to tell them yes I am you don't have to tell them the truth
[01:14:58] oh that's not true no that's not true and when you're interviewing people you don't have to
[01:15:04] tell them the truth either you know you're interviewing a couple people and like when you're like
[01:15:08] you can't talk to that girl you told her you had all this information yes or you arrested a couple
[01:15:12] people and hey your buddies and next room this role is going to be on this guts I knew saying it's
[01:15:16] your dope and your gun isn't no no no no it's his you know and I think you need to tell the truth
[01:15:22] and that too you know you can and those circumstances you don't have to necessarily tell the truth
[01:15:27] did you do a lot of that interrogation type stuff yes and you get trained to do that did you
[01:15:34] said you did they said you through training or was it just what you learned over the years
[01:15:38] in the academy you learned the basics of it and there's different schools like the
[01:15:42] read school and everything I never went to a formal school most of that I got was on the job training
[01:15:50] you know I got what some you know agents and some local police that were good at it
[01:15:55] and just picked up and learned you know hey this seems to work this doesn't work you know so
[01:16:01] I just like I said I kind of a knack at getting people to talk and also like I said good with
[01:16:07] informants all right so after you got done with that conspiracy thing what was the next thing
[01:16:14] you had the west side task force and the west side task force that's where you're working with
[01:16:18] the regular police from Phoenix and you're all working together to try and do good do good yes
[01:16:27] you know and people don't realize that without the local law enforcement we can't do our job
[01:16:32] you know the locals they know the area they have the local connects and everything and most of the
[01:16:38] DEA groups have local law enforcement officers sworn in as task force agents in the groups
[01:16:45] you know but we can't do the do the job by herself and I kind of helped me me working at a local
[01:16:51] law enforcement agency first too I kind of had respect and street cred from a lot of the local
[01:16:58] officers and I didn't think I was as big bad hif you know federal agent and you're just just
[01:17:03] lowly pion law enforcement officers you know I I respected them and so what are you guys doing
[01:17:09] you guys going after like different levels of drug dealers or what's what makes that west side
[01:17:16] task force different than just regular DEA it was we focus on the west side okay and the west the
[01:17:23] west area suburbs and is it is it the fact that you're working with them closely in interoperability
[01:17:28] and exchanging information that gives you a better chance of catching bad guys yes and it also bolsters
[01:17:34] our numbers too and we actually in a swiss eye task force we actually worked in one of the
[01:17:42] west side police agencies off-site locations for the Glendale Police Department in Arizona
[01:17:49] so we're actually you know you're with them every day day in day out so same thing you're doing
[01:17:56] investigations but you're utilizing the local cops to help you do the investigations correct is that right
[01:18:01] yes okay so you're doing that and then I kind of pulled you back in the story a little bit
[01:18:08] but you but then you you started hearing about the fast company and what you could do what that's
[01:18:14] gonna look like but you're 39 years old you got some mileage on yes chances and so you're trying
[01:18:19] to get in shape for that how do you find out you got picked up or what was the application process like
[01:18:24] well you know he had to fill just you know fill out this questionnaire you know I've been on the job
[01:18:28] you know this many years and this is kind of the background of things I did on a job and you have to get
[01:18:34] your concurrence from your supervisor and then the concurrence from the special agent and
[01:18:42] charge whatever division you're in and you submit it and if you're qualified your name is picked
[01:18:49] to go to selection so they set a date for selection and they give you a list of you know
[01:18:56] hey these are some of the events you're gonna have to do kind of give you outline how to train for them
[01:19:03] you know you have to do our standard DAPT test which is no great shake you know you have to do the
[01:19:10] shooting pistol and lawn rifle but you get a score higher rock marches you know with weight on
[01:19:20] you you're doing a certain time a distance run you know all these different thinking and you know
[01:19:26] kind of thinking on your feet and leadership different tasks and things and you actually have to
[01:19:32] we use actually use this company that they before a lot of people in the military go to
[01:19:42] different special options they have to take this test online which is kind of like a psychological
[01:19:48] and like an IQ test and you got to answer these questions and then they can pretty much figure
[01:19:55] out if a person's gonna make it or not do how you do these things somebody needs to tell the
[01:20:00] damn seal teams about back because we sell 1180 percent attrition rate after however many years
[01:20:06] it's been 60 years or the actually no it's been for even 70 80 years of doing that training
[01:20:11] and putting people through that training we still can't figure who's gonna make it well
[01:20:15] African quit you know and we do you know say and I think we started with I think there was
[01:20:24] close to 40 of us in our selection and only 11 made it through to this selection take place
[01:20:30] chronicle the first part yes the first week it takes part in chronicle all in house it's kind of like
[01:20:37] is it a beat down oh yes it's kind of like we call like our hell week and who's running it is
[01:20:45] agents from fast and fast how long has fast been around for? Was it created after September 11?
[01:20:52] Yes after September 11 yes but you said there was a previous like unit that would snow cap
[01:20:58] yes that was prior to that so they took maybe some old snow cap people brought them back
[01:21:02] and see if they could help out something like yes how to you know get them get the unit organized
[01:21:07] in the training and logistics and you know weaponry you know but you're going to overseas fight
[01:21:12] in the war so you're using weapons and weapons systems the average DEA agent doesn't never
[01:21:17] use in their career you know you're using you know belt-fed crew surf weapons you know grenade launchers
[01:21:24] you know handheld mortars Carl Gustav rockets you know laws you know kind of crap you know so
[01:21:36] you know you're doing all this stuff so you know you they really you know invest in you and like
[01:21:42] once if you make it through training you make it through selection and you get picked up on a fast
[01:21:48] team you have to least commit doing three years because they're putting all this time in effort
[01:21:53] and training into you so what made most people quit how long was it how long was the selection
[01:22:01] process the first hell week was like a week and you had tier one events they were their past failed
[01:22:07] and if you fail one event you're gone and then we had tier two events where tier one event
[01:22:13] would be a force rock march force rock marchers and tiles here's the time yeah it's like it's right
[01:22:18] here's the time a distance run was like a five mile run our PT test shooting test
[01:22:28] things of that nature a basic swim crawl got it and then the tier two were like this you know
[01:22:36] different other events and if you failed one tier two you were put on probation and then if you failed
[01:22:42] another one you could get removed we also had peer revalues throughout too because we had learned
[01:22:51] life lessons you know some people can just fly through all the physical activity things and
[01:22:56] some people had a lot of military experience but they can't play well with others so you're
[01:23:01] living in confined spaces you know and you're just living with an asshole and we didn't have time for
[01:23:06] that so you could actually get peered out too so sort of people quitting this selection or they
[01:23:12] just not passing those standards about about half a both you know you know and when you go
[01:23:20] through there they're telling you what you're getting into you know this is what you're getting into
[01:23:26] and this unit is not for everybody and just because it may not be for you it doesn't mean that
[01:23:32] you're a bad agent that you can't do your normal job but this is what you're getting into and
[01:23:37] it's a whole that's a total volunteer unit so you get people that are going through
[01:23:42] slacking you're just getting your dick knocked into dirt and you know and if it was just you know
[01:23:47] you did you every day you did like a tier one event you'd be fine but you're also getting hazed
[01:23:52] in between you know and carrying the logs and the inflatable boats and you know doing crossfit
[01:23:59] workouts and you know you're 39 years old you're not getting much sleep but they're feeding you
[01:24:05] well it was the average age of the rest of the class I would say low 30s so you know
[01:24:14] did you have trouble with anything the water stuff I've always looked like you might be a
[01:24:22] little bit of a sinker and I learned that muscle does not float as I say that man yeah we learned
[01:24:29] that the seal things like you get these big jacked guys that are not only big and jacked also
[01:24:35] ripped and that means they don't have a lot of body fat and that doesn't lean this doesn't help either
[01:24:40] oh yeah lean this doesn't help either you know so I grew up with a swimming pool and we had a
[01:24:44] cottage on the lake in Michigan so obviously I was saying I was fairly confident in water
[01:24:50] but just in I had to learn in the pool you have to relax the more you get yourself worked out
[01:24:58] you get oxygen deprived and then you're screwed so you know for treading water for long periods
[01:25:04] of time and you know swimming and beaty use and boots and everything you have to stay calm
[01:25:13] you know we didn't quite do the 50 meter underwater swim like you got we did a 25
[01:25:17] you know and beaty use and to me you know it's like you know they kind of tell you know go deep
[01:25:23] and you know and stroke and glide and you know I'm doing all that and then when you get close to
[01:25:29] the wall it's like I'm starting to do the panic swim you know you know I'm screwing myself you know
[01:25:37] you know so yeah relax and glide that's as you're said that done in many things exactly you know
[01:25:42] and keep in your breathing controlled and everything you know so you know after I did enough to
[01:25:48] pass with the swimming so afterwards when I got selected on the fast team they have to be I had a
[01:25:54] pool over there so I'd go there a couple times a week and just go into water and just swim and get
[01:25:59] better at it so so how long was the whole selection process you know you the first week is like
[01:26:05] the hell week and then you do a training phase next and that's usually a couple months and that's
[01:26:15] usually run by a ODE Green Bra team or with us it was going to be Naval Special Warfare
[01:26:23] but the seals and I was the first group that was done by the seals and sometimes the first part
[01:26:29] goes and then you go right into your training phase and learning the first part goes
[01:26:39] how we how we can then go to people to quit yes and then you go right into your training phase but
[01:26:45] we got to have a break because we were going to use a Navy Special Warfare not more going to be
[01:26:50] ready for a couple months so we got to go home and heal up and lick your wounds a little bit you
[01:26:57] know I pretty much had a blister and every part of my foot I lost every toenail and both feet and
[01:27:02] at the time my girlfriend picked me up from the airport after the hell we can she's like
[01:27:05] what happened to you of course I was beat the shit head to go to the ER room the next day
[01:27:12] as I put was infected you know I'm trying to tell him what happened they're looking at me like
[01:27:17] I don't this doesn't sound right you volunteered for this you volunteered and just because you
[01:27:24] make it through everything say the hell week still the fast cadre they sit down and you have to
[01:27:31] be asked to go on to the second phase of training so I made it through that and got to go home
[01:27:38] just lick your wounds for a little bit and go back to working your regular group and then we
[01:27:43] reported in early spring we started selection I think February 2009 early spring of that year
[01:27:53] to a little creek Virginia to do our second phase of training so we're like okay I think we're
[01:27:59] gonna tell this is your learning phase this is supposed to be the gentleman's course now
[01:28:03] Roger Roger that so you know the seals had never had outside people there either
[01:28:09] so we show up and some of the cadre and some of the people from team 2 and 10
[01:28:15] hey we got so much old B to use for you guys and when you guys getting your badges and this
[01:28:21] and that they didn't have no clue I'm like well I have my past 12 years and you know we pretty much
[01:28:26] got a lot of high speed stuff so we're staying at the Navy in there and little creek and so we
[01:28:33] report 0-30 to first day and for formation of PT and we go straight to the ocean
[01:28:42] good times team 2 in the ocean out of the ocean you know sugar cookies home I'm like oh really
[01:28:48] I'm like I thought this was supposed to be a gentleman course and they were like we were told to
[01:28:55] treat you guys like buds I'm like who the hell told you that you know so you know you gotta
[01:29:00] got hammered and but you know they kind of you know slacked off you know for a while and you know
[01:29:07] he had different things distance runs and stuff so we spent time training there and then
[01:29:12] we bumped over to for Chaffey Arkansas to do the Land Warfare part of that and you know it was
[01:29:18] gave us it was very very good training to say the least and it was funny before we went over there
[01:29:27] and we found out the seals were gonna do our second phase and other buddy who was very confident
[01:29:33] but he was struggling to water low bed I called him and I was like do you hear who doing our
[01:29:37] second phase he goes yeah the seals like oh yeah and then you cut you ended up coming out
[01:29:45] the west coast to do some training too because you just laid around that's after I got selected
[01:29:49] on the fast team okay so when did you actually get selected October of 2009 okay and just because
[01:29:58] you make it through all the training it doesn't mean you're gonna be picked up on the fast team
[01:30:03] because as openings occur they you can get cherry pick from the list god got it so you
[01:30:11] was there anything else about the the initial training course when you were at team two
[01:30:17] you went to for Chaffey you go do training out there are you training with a task unit or they
[01:30:22] just put you through training as your own entity that one it wasn't like they were as our own
[01:30:27] entity oh really so you had you know people from trade it there and actually a senior chief
[01:30:33] um 20 gale was assigned to you know yeah yeah 20 he's he's such a beast so he's like
[01:30:45] smaller than me he shorter than me he looks like how do I describe this he don't look like
[01:30:53] he's like a super beast but he's faster than me and he could bench press more than me so he was
[01:30:57] like better than me at everything and no one would ever you know suspect that and you know he can
[01:31:03] go through the obstacle course pretty good just freaking awesome he's freaking awesome then he had a
[01:31:07] a uh master chief hitchcock to help out right on right off yeah both of those guys with things and so
[01:31:14] yeah it was um it was it was it was intense and of course we would do different events
[01:31:20] you know what the team guys and if we did a distance front of course they put their distance
[01:31:25] front stud out there oh yeah or if we did a crossfit workout they put you know they're best
[01:31:29] crossfit her out there you know you know so they kind of cherry picked you know people what
[01:31:36] you know I don't blame them you know when you shop there okay so we're doing a distance
[01:31:40] front you couldn't wear any watch no GPS and we're just gonna run and so you guys get did get it
[01:31:46] hooked up with a little bit of extra bonus program yeah and it wouldn't tell you know how long
[01:31:51] we're running for you know I've always been a bigger guy and I cut weight for that so I knew
[01:31:57] we'd do an all-than-dernstuff so I was sitting around 212 20 but we had some guys on our team
[01:32:02] to look into 160s you know I can run a couple six-minute miles but I can't run six-minute miles
[01:32:07] for 10 minutes and we had somebody's little rabbits they could do that not not me you know I
[01:32:12] blow through a crossfit workout no problem but you know so we've gone these distance running
[01:32:17] and we wouldn't you wouldn't know how long you were going for when you were done it's like
[01:32:20] you know just do your best you know okay what's the time hack here we didn't not tell you you
[01:32:26] can't have a watch on so you don't even know how fast you're going anyways yeah well that
[01:32:29] they were treating you like bud students because in buds you don't have a watch and it's a total
[01:32:33] pain in the ass because you never know what you're doing the only thing you can do it just go as hard
[01:32:36] as you can because that's the best they can do you know well in selection what I I didn't try to look
[01:32:41] too far in advance I just took each activity for it was you know in your viewing beat down and
[01:32:48] on our team day the last day of help the kind of hell week I was just like hey Joe just taking
[01:32:55] another step just worry about one more step and then we'll worry about the rest later I didn't try
[01:33:03] to overwhelm myself you know and I read some things before you know about some different selections
[01:33:09] and things and that's one of the things they said don't overwhelm yourself just worry about
[01:33:16] one thing at a time and you make it through that well you worry about the next thing then
[01:33:21] so you get done so did you do anything besides chaffy?
[01:33:28] how does that land warfare with those guys? we went to chaffy and then back to the creek and then
[01:33:35] you we culminating you know you're doing FTX's throughout and then it culminates with a final
[01:33:41] FTX where you got to hit a target over there and you go in you know what Sims and everything
[01:33:46] and they didn't have the the miles gear like we had a nylon there and you know you do a hit
[01:33:54] the group I was in we had to fast rope on top of this building at night and it could be tricking
[01:34:00] we used our DEA pilots and they hope they can hold a hover good but there was always a couple of times
[01:34:06] when guys almost were going down the rope in the ropes not over the building and you know I
[01:34:12] was always been a heavy guy if I'm full kid or I was carrying my ego I'm not stopping myself
[01:34:18] on that rope. I was made to you I'm not when I'm going I'm going that rope better be in the right
[01:34:22] spot because I'm going to be at the bottom of it in about two seconds and that's that it is funny
[01:34:25] when we were doing our fast rope training at little creek and the towers and everything you
[01:34:31] know you serve the tower at first and you do your appelling and everything it you know it
[01:34:35] just take your time sit down you know and the helicopter you know and then grab the rope and
[01:34:41] slowly spin yourself just take your time so when we go and the helicopters in first time to
[01:34:47] feel you're like go go go go go go go what happened just take your time thing you're like
[01:34:53] effort I guess we're doing it live you know so you get done with that and you said that's when
[01:34:59] you actually got selected or chosen to go to a fast what you call the fast companies that's team
[01:35:06] fast team so you actually get selected to go to a fast team and that's in the fall of 2009
[01:35:12] correct October 2009 and when you get there are you going do you know you're going on
[01:35:19] a deployment at a certain time well we knew what team you were going to we had five teams at the time
[01:35:26] uh LFO through Echo and each team is made up of one supervisor eight agents in one intel analyst so I
[01:35:35] knew a team I was going on then once we got there they would tell you okay we always had a
[01:35:43] team in Afghanistan all the time and each deployment lasted 120 days give or take some days and
[01:35:50] so you knew when you were going up so once I got there I was assigned to Delta team which was
[01:35:59] made up of some senior agents and what some of the newer individuals and we were set to go to
[01:36:08] do the the first deployment Afghanistan was going to be the spring summerter of 2010 and a lot of
[01:36:18] people don't know in Afghanistan there's a fighting season over there you know as you get
[01:36:22] bad weather there it gets winter and stuff like that so in a spring summer that's when all the
[01:36:27] fighting is going on and that's when they're harvesting the opium poppy to manufacture the heroin so
[01:36:36] that's kind of your busy time so you get settled in and you do start doing your pleat of pre-deployment
[01:36:44] work up kind of like you know with the military and then we had a group come in you may be familiar
[01:36:51] with them they're made up of X Navy special warfare guys and actually some dev group guys called
[01:37:01] um shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot the David group okay right off and they actually we actually used
[01:37:13] your guys' system and developmental groups of combat clearing okay so they actually taught us in that
[01:37:20] and then that's when we're find out before deployments you guys are going to
[01:37:26] camp Billy making a nylon California and they're doing land warfare with a west coast seal team right
[01:37:34] off right off you know you know what what when was that do you remember when that was E yes
[01:37:43] surf on tax seasoncy April May ish of 2010 yeah um as well as I was definitely still there and
[01:37:51] ask you T-Cle you weren't there when we first got there you showed up at the end yeah sure for the
[01:37:57] after you access yeah that's what I would do and um their SQT was going through there at the time
[01:38:03] and um so it was a full house there how was that training it was intense you know it was you know
[01:38:09] three weeks day and night of you know getting you know kicked in the balls you know and you know
[01:38:16] this is what I was told in the seal pre-deployment workup that's usually the hardest pre-deployment
[01:38:23] block of the toughest yeah the land warfare especially at that time was no joke you know so there was
[01:38:31] a lot of buddy carrying you know for extreme distances you know you know and you know different things
[01:38:38] but I tell you you got to learn how to do you know land warfare drills very effectively you got to
[01:38:50] get to know how to use your equipment your night vision your lasers very well you came out of
[01:38:57] their well prepared like you know knowing that something happens in combat you know but you you know
[01:39:02] you ran out there you know you're training there for worst case scenario you know and so yeah that was
[01:39:09] always my goal was that and you know the goal was as crazy as a goal this may seem like the goal was oh okay
[01:39:18] I want to make sure that these guys if they get into a gunfight it's they're going to be it's going
[01:39:24] to seem easy compared to what they've been through in training and I had countless guys come back
[01:39:29] to me and say hey this is the situation we're in here's the gunfight we got in here's the contact
[01:39:33] we got in here's the scenario we were in and they were able to handle it exquisitely because the
[01:39:40] training the land warfare training that they'd been through and the urban training that they've been
[01:39:43] to was so hard that the actual combat seemed easy now obviously can you simulate someone actually
[01:39:50] getting wounded or actually getting killed know you can't but as far as especially from a leadership
[01:39:55] perspective understanding how to manage all those elements on the battlefield and then the young
[01:40:00] shooters being thinking shooters and knowing how to execute knowing how to operate knowing how to
[01:40:04] move themselves it's just an awesome package that that you have you have this just unified team when
[01:40:10] they get done with those with those training cycle so it was nice because in Nyland you know they
[01:40:16] know they broke us up in this intermixed us with the team you know so they put a couple
[01:40:20] of you know with this you know fire team that fire team so they kind of mixed in so it was it was
[01:40:28] it was very very good training a lot of the the train and stuff there and Nyland was good
[01:40:34] visit it's very similar to Afghanistan terrain too I was get we were trying we had some some
[01:40:39] other military entities trying to get control of that training site for us and I remember I put
[01:40:45] together a brief for my leadership in the chain of command my most senior leadership in the chain of
[01:40:49] command and what I did was I took pictures of Nyland and pictures of Afghanistan of like seals
[01:40:56] patrolling in Nyland and seals patrolling in Afghanistan and I put together like five or six of those
[01:41:01] pictures side by side in a slide show and I said this is the terrain we're fighting in and this
[01:41:06] is the terrain we're training in we can't do any better than this right here and we need to maintain
[01:41:12] control this and so yeah it's it's it's it's very it's almost on candy how similar those two
[01:41:17] environments can look and I didn't realize when we were there he had two army Rangers you know doing
[01:41:23] an exchange program that he'll teach the land warfare there yep yep you know those those
[01:41:27] Rangers that we would bring out their just outstanding guys because we as seals always want to have
[01:41:33] an open mind and make sure that we are understanding the tactics the techniques the procedures of
[01:41:38] other units what do they know better than us what can they teach us what can we've learned from them
[01:41:42] and that's one of the ways that we've always done that is taking individuals from other units
[01:41:47] and bringing them to our units especially to our instructor cadre so that we can learn more and
[01:41:51] try and get better and those those Rangers that work with us were just outstanding guys and I say
[01:41:57] and I feel you guys do an outstanding job of your guys as training you know like you said you know
[01:42:03] knowing that hey there's always you know there's more than one way to skin a cat no
[01:42:08] and what see what other people are doing you know you you put things in your toolbox and
[01:42:12] hey I might use this again or hey I may never use that again but you have a lot of tools in that
[01:42:16] toolbox yeah indeed so you end up going on deployment to Afghanistan your first deployment how's that
[01:42:25] it's some intense every time we go to Afghanistan things are a little different and at the time
[01:42:33] we were doing a lot of work with the Army ODA's the Green Braise there and at this particular time
[01:42:42] we were operating in Panjoe area you know the Panjoe of Canada area is kind of the first place of
[01:42:51] Taliban where there's a lot of in search and activity but also a lot of heroin production going on
[01:42:57] there also so they broke us up into like two z's and three z's input us with different units
[01:43:05] and a good partner of mine friend of mine Travis Brooks and myself we were assigned with
[01:43:15] first special forces group over there ODA 1231 and they were stationed in Cancemins this
[01:43:22] little little base outside of Canada Airfield which is like our main bases that can't
[01:43:28] be had our airfield in Afghanistan we were living with the ODA the first group guys you know and we would bring
[01:43:37] like I said earlier our expertise investigations and we had our partner force over there which we were
[01:43:44] mentoring and we were living over there with the Green Braise and using our intel information
[01:43:52] you know from the DEA and also using the military information and we would try to pair
[01:43:58] that information find out where the bigger drug labs were where they were selling the chemicals
[01:44:06] and equipment to manufacture heroin and we would not go after is the opion farmers the Poppy farmers
[01:44:13] because a lot of times they were made to grow the opion you know the Taliban came in and they had
[01:44:18] the biggest stick at the time either you know you're growing this Poppy force or you're
[01:44:21] can killed you know so we knew they weren't reaping the benefits so we would try to find you know
[01:44:26] the people who were getting the money from this and it's called a narco terrorism nexus
[01:44:35] and so we would hit these bigger locations and take people off the battlefield and train
[01:44:39] to Afghans how to process and how to conduct these you know investigations and we were
[01:44:48] with the the Green Braise you had the time they were doing movements to contact
[01:44:53] which for the non you know military people and I didn't know at the time because I wasn't in
[01:44:59] the military before you know you basically go on a hot air and you pick a fight and you access
[01:45:04] us the enemy how strong they are and you stay there for a couple days and then a lot of times
[01:45:11] conventional forces are brought in and we were hitting areas where a lot of drug activity was going on
[01:45:18] and had of course in panjue at the time they had a lot of implanted iEDs yeah this is 2010 yes
[01:45:28] so iED threat is just full on at this time especially in that area you know and that's when they
[01:45:33] started switching over to like the homemade explosive the HME where the metal detectors not picking
[01:45:39] the stuff up you know we had dogs and stuff with the bomb guys and gals but sometimes they couldn't
[01:45:46] smell it and a lot of times these iEDs are hidden so well you can't see where they're at and especially
[01:45:52] at night under knots you know in every mission people were getting you know injured with iEDs you
[01:45:59] know that was you know in a straight up fight most often than not they couldn't hang with us
[01:46:06] you know so they're you know they used their weapon to iED and you know to inflater around us
[01:46:11] and you know it's like okay this is gonna be my last step i have my legs you know you're trying to
[01:46:19] do everything to try to you know mitigate it but you know you still never never know so you know we're
[01:46:25] doing these movements to contact and you know we're most often the knot hitting these labs behind
[01:46:31] enemy lab lines and that's their money they're fighting like hell to keep it you know so i think that
[01:46:38] first year i think i did if we did about 11 missions or so and it was like two times i didn't have
[01:46:46] to fire my gun and i carried a belt fed weapon at the time i showed up the fast the course
[01:46:55] the listeners can't see i'm a decent sized guy what are you walking around out at that time weightwise
[01:47:00] um two thirty-ish so they're giving you a belt fed well yes you're like you're a big guy you carry
[01:47:06] i'm saying i'm old and it's still heavy you know carry a mark 48 or mark 46 actually i'm mark 43
[01:47:13] oh damn okay you know old school m60 m4 that's crazy you know and that was made you know for you guys you
[01:47:20] know you know um we had mark 48's but i'm a left-handed rifle shooter i'm almost all jacked up
[01:47:28] i was ready left eye dominant and i shot a pistol right handed in that mark 48 you eat all the
[01:47:34] brass and link the mark 43 was a little better you i put like a broomstick handle on the front and i
[01:47:39] moved away back and i get stand stand up and i tuck my right elbow real far in and so i wouldn't
[01:47:47] catch as much Lincoln brass you know the cyclic rate of fire i'm at mark 43's not quite as fast as the
[01:47:53] 48 but as you know it's it's it's a pretty reliable it's a it's a reliable weapon you know so i
[01:48:00] carried that damn thing every remission you know it's nice to have because it does a lot of damage
[01:48:08] but as uh automatic gunner the enemy knows that so you're a target too hundred percent you know
[01:48:14] in tracers work both ways they do and luckily at night i got a hold of some of the i-r tracers
[01:48:21] okay which you can only see under naz and usually the enemy did not you know for the most part
[01:48:25] and at there they did not have night vision capabilities so yeah it was um you had to you fire
[01:48:35] and you move your position a little bit and you fire move your position a little bit and you know
[01:48:39] it's not like TV you know that you had a box of a hundred rounds on that you gun and it doesn't
[01:48:44] last for five minutes you know if you're hammering that trigger down it's goes pretty quick so you
[01:48:50] gotta learn to conserve your ammo and spread load ammo with other people too well you going out with
[01:48:55] so you're going out with an ODA team at this time yes and you also would have afghan partners with
[01:49:00] you yes so these are pretty big elements that you're going out of yes and the ODA had their um
[01:49:05] partner force too oh so wait so you guys had your own partner force yes wow like a DEA and afghan
[01:49:13] DEA yes it's the national introduction unit okay um the afghans they were more their
[01:49:19] investigators and then the green braze or ever group they had their own group too right which the
[01:49:25] um green braze like to use the afghan commandos that was kind of like their special ops unit
[01:49:32] you know but it's to be quite honest with you even like we were working with the best in brightest
[01:49:38] it was like hurting cats oh for sure yeah you know it's like okay you know what's you know you
[01:49:42] couldn't do these advance like um wedge and echelon movement I was like single file those get in line
[01:49:49] and we hope you can stay in line get in line in please stay in line and stay behind the bomb people
[01:49:54] and listen that you know don't walk on like the path this is look like people walk the most don't
[01:50:00] go over the foot bridges but that's where we're gonna place the i.e.s and within 10 minutes on the ground
[01:50:05] they're everywhere oh my oh Jesus they're gonna get me blown up you how big would these elements
[01:50:10] be so you got the odi team the commandos your guys and then the the afghan d a whatever you call them
[01:50:17] yes what are you talking like you got like 50 people yeah it depends how big the operation is you know
[01:50:24] a green braid odi team we got like 12 individuals and they're partner force probably you would
[01:50:31] be around 30 you know and fast um because we were like two season three zes have a two to four fast
[01:50:38] agents and we would bring our partner force at this particular time like we could cherry pick people
[01:50:45] that were the better um fighters and um sometimes two to four we would take out and
[01:50:52] did be honest like I said we worked the best in brightest not a high percentage of them were
[01:50:58] good fighters and a lot of times they weren't in great shape so we're kind of limited what
[01:51:04] you can do how long of an infill and ex-fill you can do and how complicated a plan you could do so
[01:51:13] you know it kind of hamstringed us a little bit you know but we went out there in got the job done
[01:51:21] you know when we were really hitting them hard you know they call it second third order effects
[01:51:26] you could see they were having trouble getting some more of the better munitions and stuff
[01:51:31] um when we were like this you know putting a smack down on them and um halfway through that
[01:51:39] first oh they had the end of that first order we had first group was leaving and then a group from
[01:51:45] third group came in ODA 3116 and they came in and we did a couple missions with them and
[01:51:54] I know you're probably familiar with this and some of the listeners you know that the Afghans
[01:52:01] they use these icon radios to talk with each other and we intercept these things you know a lot
[01:52:06] times they're just talking shit on these damn things you know we're killing them you know the
[01:52:11] marriage they're dying know we found your idea and we're blowing it up you know that's what you just
[01:52:15] heard and you know so we're getting at the end of our tour and we're gonna hit the spot
[01:52:24] um called Hazi Medott in Afghanistan and there was a little combat outpost out there
[01:52:34] which I think the hundred and first airborne was out there and they had a Taliban hospital in the
[01:52:40] area and of course they were growing a lot of marijuana and poppy seed out there and but they also had
[01:52:46] several dish goes into areas the enemy did and that's the old like Russian anti-aircraft weaponry
[01:52:52] 51 and they would harass the coalition forces their air so you know we had several tasks in this
[01:53:02] mission you know the fine drug you know the eradicate some of the drug activity going on and also find these
[01:53:08] dishgoss so the rainders went in there before us and they got in a pretty good dust up and tick
[01:53:15] stands for troops in contact and they lost a couple of Rangers so we were going in a couple of days after
[01:53:23] and you're doing your pre-mission briefing and you know we're gonna get inserted with you know
[01:53:29] three CH47 and four CH47 helicopters and there's a high probability we're gonna lose
[01:53:37] a helicopter on infill with the dish goes and you know you're sitting in the night before you
[01:53:41] oh shit I hope it's not me you're like a coffin up there you know even most time when we flew
[01:53:48] with the the green braise they used like to use the night stalkers in one sixty it and we would
[01:53:55] always infill an ex-fill with a spectrogunship overhead you know but still that's not any guarantees
[01:54:02] and so you said night before I hope it's not me you know it was not our helicopter to get shot down
[01:54:07] so we plan this up and we infill we usually like to go in at night to use the our our advantage
[01:54:17] whether technology were the night vision and later lasers because I stated earlier the enemy
[01:54:22] usually doesn't have that so we like to go in at night get a foothold the best we can and then
[01:54:29] when it's light search and then you know ex-fill the next day or depending how long the
[01:54:34] mission's gonna last you know a day or two or whatnot so we fly in and we take a little incoming
[01:54:42] fire but all four birds make it so we begin to sweep through and get a foothold and then
[01:54:52] for individuals are listening that you know it's been over there usually they'll try to hit or
[01:54:59] probe you the enemy over there after first after morning prayer and then you see they do their first hit
[01:55:07] try to feel you out so we get in a couple little skirmishes see him plan some i.e. ds and
[01:55:17] you know we're okay we're moving through and we didn't find where we were at we didn't find the
[01:55:23] discos we're gonna find some marijuana fields in this and that throughout the day they're talking
[01:55:29] you're like we need to find a good place to set up our p.k.m machine guns meaning the enemy
[01:55:36] and you know we blew up an i.d. and like I said already you know oh we are killing them you know
[01:55:41] we're you know the Americans are screaming and so you know they're you know setting up their p.k.
[01:55:47] you know so like okay you're just but you're bullshit whatever screw you so this is an august
[01:55:55] and it's high to sell and we didn't have any close airs ports at the time was they got
[01:56:03] called over to some other units that were having some contact so we had a predator overhead
[01:56:10] but the predators wings i stole over and had the land you know this is you know 115 degree you know
[01:56:16] it's 10 degrees but I you know you they're flying up higher and I don't know the specifics and stuff so
[01:56:23] you know we're in sporadic scrimmishes so we were under fire so they're like um we're not
[01:56:31] going to send air to pick you up because the l.s. is pretty you're going to be pretty hot so you're
[01:56:37] going to have to make it we're going to have to try to make it to this combat outpost over there
[01:56:42] which was probably a couple clicks away at the time so we moved out and we stopped this little
[01:56:52] like villageria and we get set up to make our final push and it was just the villagers there
[01:57:02] just had it just we had a funny sense and like a spider is something something's not right
[01:57:07] you know you know we get in there where your IDs how we do not know where they are okay so okay
[01:57:15] you're going to go on front of us and you're going to take us through you know and you get to spot
[01:57:21] I will not go any further you must kill me oh I thought you don't know where the IDs were you know
[01:57:26] so we found a couple IDs and bloom up and so where the termination is made we're going to make
[01:57:31] it to the combat outpost so at this time we're probably about clicking a half away or so
[01:57:39] so we're moving through this is daylight and we're in a single file and one of our guys see some
[01:57:47] movements in this little hot above us and he's like tells one of the green braise hey I think
[01:57:53] I saw some movement so he glasses it with his scope and doesn't see anything so we're moving out
[01:58:00] and I'm next to like a pony wall like a probably a couple foot pony wall to my right of me
[01:58:07] and I tell you one thing those old mud buildings like when you're over there there's mud uh
[01:58:12] you can explain to people and bless you over there you can't believe people still lift like this
[01:58:17] but those those things do a hell job stopping bullets and stuff so we're going through and then
[01:58:24] sure is shit they were looking for a place to step to pee camps we got caught in a near ambush
[01:58:32] so I got bullets going over my head coming to the side of me and people are caught off we got
[01:58:40] four people hit right off the bat when the ambush opened one being the ODA team sergeant and he's like
[01:58:47] I got a formal bleed and we're like oh shit so I'm rocking my 43 and I usually care about
[01:58:58] 400 rounds of ammo on me and we had spread loaded some more and so you know I'm trying to pick
[01:59:06] up like puffs a smoke or I think enemy fires coming from but I'm also trying to conserve some of
[01:59:11] my ammo too because we start getting overrun I want to have some but I always carry to pistol with me
[01:59:17] too and at least one frag grenade because if I could help I wasn't you know I'm going to fight to
[01:59:22] that I'm not I don't want to be taken alive and so I'm rocking through ammo and being the near
[01:59:29] ambush you know people are throwing hand grenades it was that close you know firing law rockets
[01:59:34] and I asked one of our Afghan counterparks who's both English and the ODA counterparts they
[01:59:44] carried the full length 240 bravos so it's the same round at the mark 43 was fire so I'm like
[01:59:55] go get me some ammo so he runs out and brings you back a little link ammo about 20 bravos like
[02:00:01] what am I gonna do with this so I just link it one of my belts so that's okay and so we're
[02:00:09] fighting and we finally get some close air support we get a f16 from the UAE but they won't fire
[02:00:17] and you know we got people hit and we got in the meta-vac coming in and I tell you those
[02:00:23] meta-vac pilots have balls of steel when they come and they started coming in RPGs were shooting
[02:00:28] up all around them they landed those birds and got our most severely wounded people out of there
[02:00:35] and you know back to you know higher care you know so we finally get some close air support
[02:00:43] to suppress it a little bit the hundred and first here's all this activity going out so they
[02:00:49] bring some of their gun trucks but they can't get too close to us so we're like okay we got a
[02:00:56] you know we're getting a little break so like okay we got to make it this combat outpost so we did
[02:01:03] our vote our version of the Mogadisha mile there where you know you're running and shooting
[02:01:09] and you're not caring about the IED's at this time we had the cross-open feel and I guess you know
[02:01:13] you're up you see me I'm down you know I guess if I step on some shit I guess I'm gonna blow up
[02:01:19] and you know they get their gun trucks out there and they start shooting in some press of fire
[02:01:24] and we ended up getting to the combat outposts and of course we look all look like soup sandwiches
[02:01:31] you know I'm done here it was like you guys were out there you go yeah
[02:01:36] I learned in a combat you know we got stationed you know set there and you know got some rest and
[02:01:42] we're gonna go to the Chahong get some food and that's when I learned most of the bases we were staying at
[02:01:46] the unlimited food and that's when I learned to combat outposts just limited rations you know you only get
[02:01:52] you know what's there little serving you know so grace of God everybody ended up surviving you know we
[02:01:59] had some some injuries but we ended up surviving so that concluded my turn and I tell you what I
[02:02:06] had a bat you know I thought it was gonna end that day because when you come close to running
[02:02:10] ammo you'd like oh shit you know what tell them what to do you know so it was it was quite
[02:02:17] inexperienced so we kind of went out with went out in a bang that first her yeah sorry yeah you
[02:02:25] definitely seemed to end that deployment with a bang when you when you got done with that deployment
[02:02:30] as you looked back at it what were some of the takeaways that you got from your experiences there
[02:02:37] like anything I've done in life okay every mission I would take it for each mission it's like okay
[02:02:43] these are the things I did right in the mission these are things I want to do the same again
[02:02:49] and these are the things I did wrong I never want to do again so each thing you know I looked at
[02:02:54] myself critically I've always been probably my own worst critic these you know I don't want to do
[02:02:59] that ever again you know and this is what I want to do and you can probably relate and some of our
[02:03:06] listeners probably the more you're in that environment you never get 100% used to it but you get
[02:03:12] calmer during it I remember my very first operation it's oh dark 30 you know with the green
[02:03:19] rays that year and lucky we didn't get any a ticks or anything is I remember landing in the middle
[02:03:25] of the night in the middle of nowhere and I guess I said I guess it's just for real now
[02:03:31] you know I'm just trying to make sure I don't lose my element and night being a night vision it's
[02:03:36] you know it's not the easiest to see you know you know and we had some pretty decent night vision
[02:03:40] it's like please please Lord let me keep up with the people in my group but not get lost out here
[02:03:45] by myself so you know and I told I was talking to my fellow some fellow agents back in Arizona when
[02:03:53] I got back and I was telling them stories you know this is what we're doing you know you're like oh
[02:03:59] you're bullshitting there's no way you did that shit I'm like oh yeah we did you know it's
[02:04:04] common you know everything kind of fell in the place where I don't know if it ever will happen again
[02:04:10] you're at war with a country that has a drug nexus you know so it's I did things as a DA agent
[02:04:17] I never thought in a million years I'd be doing and you know people would ask me would you
[02:04:22] scare it or nervous I said yeah how yeah I was you know I said but you still had a job to do you know
[02:04:30] there's nothing you know scary or feeling you're going to land you know you're giving you know
[02:04:35] five minutes two minutes and you hear the door gunners open up you know you're going into a hot
[02:04:39] LZ you know you had to unassus burning you know so I put in some fire down but I explained
[02:04:46] it to it's like at the amusement park you ride in the biggest baddest roller coaster you're
[02:04:50] scared nervous and then when you get done it's like okay when we go back again you know I guess
[02:04:56] I got I get that warp sense you know I've always been kind of an adrenaline junkie but
[02:05:02] you know it's like are you nuts I don't know if I'm nuts but you know I tend to I've always even
[02:05:10] football tend to excel when the pressure was on you know some people fold under pressure some
[02:05:18] people can handle it well luckily for me I always had a neck of being able to still function pretty
[02:05:26] effectively under stress when you got home from that deployment you said you went back to Arizona
[02:05:34] do you know back to uh quantum code okay so you got back to quantum code yes so is that where you're
[02:05:39] actually living now is in quantum code since you're with the fast team well I'm retired now but when I was
[02:05:44] on the fast team yes I was living in the quantum area I was living actually in Frederick's bird
[02:05:50] Virginia okay so you get back from that deployment no one can believe what you did you can
[02:05:55] barely believe what you did I'm just lucky to make it out there with my life you know and have
[02:05:59] two legs still you know and then what's next you get it you get to decompress you know you get
[02:06:07] to spend time with your family you know you've been going a while they send the the psychologists in
[02:06:13] and they kind of debrief you and see if you have any issues or problems and you just get to take
[02:06:20] it easy for a while and to spend time with your family and just relax and recoup a rage
[02:06:26] and how long is that decompression time you know you see a month or so nice you know and so then
[02:06:32] you know we were scheduled to do our next tour in Afghanistan it was going to be the late early
[02:06:39] winter tour of 2011 and the meantime we started operating in the western hemisphere also
[02:06:48] and we had a team out there echo team which their primary thing was to western hemisphere
[02:06:57] and they were given us language training and Spanish and everything and they were operating in
[02:07:03] Honduras real shit hole too. Rohitans real nice you know the scuba diving destination is up
[02:07:11] but the rest of the country is a disaster a lot of a lot of violence there so echo teams going there
[02:07:18] and they're doing which is called these air tracks of interest and we were working in conjunction with
[02:07:25] Joyce joint task force bravo over there out of soda cano and what we're looking for is the small
[02:07:32] like planes these sessnows and different things coming from source countries and like cocaine
[02:07:39] Peru itself like that loaded with cocaine you know multiple hundred kilos of co-gattotime
[02:07:44] and you know they would fly in and land in these remote landing strips and their so-called
[02:07:52] remote land was like a road or just like a clearing and they would come in there at night with no
[02:07:58] no night vision and no runway lights you just have like things lit up and land and you know try to
[02:08:08] safely land the plane but the drug dealers didn't really long as the the cocaine was okay
[02:08:14] then care of the plane got destroyed so we were we were sent to they need to volunteer so me and
[02:08:21] another guy from my team volunteered to go and help them out so we go and we're in soda cano we
[02:08:31] doing training with our partner force there getting up to speed and our tactics how to take down
[02:08:39] plane land and take down a plane and all that jazz and we're going to join task force bravo
[02:08:45] and right before we got there we were doing some training so another team went there they
[02:08:55] had one of these air tracks come in and they launched on it and actually got a pretty good firefight
[02:09:00] and they're actually were shooting RPGs at the you know the military aircraft the 47 is
[02:09:06] that were bringing them in and the jade don't have to be a bravo guy so like whoa whoa
[02:09:11] tight time out you know we're just supposed to drive you guys a minor transportation roll we don't
[02:09:16] really want to be in the combat here so when we got there they made a pretty good seizure and killed
[02:09:22] some you know decent amount of enemy and so we get there so they're like and like well okay we
[02:09:30] have to have so many hours of training and you know we have to practice this and that and so we're
[02:09:35] practicing and doing all that you know waiting to go and then DEA we bring some of our air airing
[02:09:41] assets there but we just have smaller vehicles a smaller aircraft like kind of like a super
[02:09:47] black hawk you can't fit a bunch of people in there and we were you know you're doing a saw you
[02:09:51] want like a CH47 or something so they're making every excuse in the world not to fly us
[02:10:00] and was this for a specific target that you're going after? um oh was it just in general they
[02:10:05] were making excuses not to fly or if a hit happen to come up in general okay because they knew
[02:10:11] that was going to be gunplay and um one of our hunter and partner forces got shot during that
[02:10:17] first operation they had to met a vac a my out and they're like if we've sent you guys down there
[02:10:24] and if somebody gets hurt we are not flying into what hot LZ to get you so there's a lot of
[02:10:31] things so we had two DEA aircraft there so we had a couple good air tracks to came up so the first one
[02:10:39] we launched just what our DEA birds and the amount of fuel then carry is not that great so you can't
[02:10:45] be up that long and it takes a while for us to get on these these these bogey birds
[02:10:54] and get tracking them um so we launched and we had um in each one of these helicopter two DEA pilots
[02:11:01] we had two fast team guys and two hunter and partner forces and these birds and each one of these birds
[02:11:09] we had a full size 240 Bravo on there in stuff but with that limited people you're not going to land
[02:11:18] in fight a force so at best we hoped to see where they land and hey if we got harassed and
[02:11:23] maybe you know you could defend yourself and put some fire down at least to say about the aircraft
[02:11:27] so we launched twice and we get on both tracks but before they landed we had to we were
[02:11:36] running uh blowing and running low and fuel so we had to get back so we're there and we're staying
[02:11:44] out at Porta Castillo near the Porta Castillo area there's a base out there that's we're launching from
[02:11:50] so they had it was a pretty big media event so they all knew we were the
[02:11:55] excuse me they all knew we were there so one of the local drug dealers he knows where
[02:12:02] coming so he leaves the country so one of his people that works on him one of his lieutenant's
[02:12:08] is there so he cocks his hair brain scheme he's going to get DEA out of there DEA's
[02:12:17] we're going to get them out of there so my boss can come back so we're staying in this hotel
[02:12:24] so we're at one of the local drug dealers says to himself I'm going to get the DEA to leave
[02:12:28] yes so the big boss may come back the big boss may not have they can come back got it
[02:12:34] so we're staying in this hotel and there's off the water there and um there's another hotel
[02:12:40] there the Christopher Columbus were a lot of the military guys are staying and they had just
[02:12:44] little air strip there so a lot of those fast guys are getting morning and do PT and we'd run
[02:12:49] in the morning so this guy scheme was they knew a kind of our schedule that they were going to
[02:12:57] when we got running the morning they're going to go and drive up and shoot a couple of us down
[02:13:03] so they're going to kill a couple de agents and dea's just going to leave and wait you got
[02:13:08] wind of this or this is just what their plan is you found out after the final we end up getting wind of
[02:13:12] it because one of the partner force guys we were working from recognized a guy
[02:13:19] in town and he said this guy in town got recruited to help kill a couple of us so key reports back
[02:13:30] he approached us to his buddy and they come to us and the two people they're going to kill in the
[02:13:36] morning is the big guy which is me and then another guy in our team Dave Klaus and the guy with
[02:13:42] the funny shorts busy as he's like colorful long goofy shorts he would wear to run and they're
[02:13:47] just going to pull up alongside of us and his machine gun is down so we get wind of this and then
[02:13:54] they get us the hell out of there back to Soda Kano and send us back to the states what about the
[02:14:02] other dea agents they were there like another week and they'd be left it was just there was
[02:14:07] it was at the end of where we're going to leave anyways and plus it's high risk low reward high
[02:14:11] risk low reward JTA problems not flying us so it was just it was this the mess we later went
[02:14:19] back there and had full support and ended doing some good with some of some other teams how
[02:14:24] did you feel when you were trying to get out of there walking from the freaking hotel to the
[02:14:28] car to the airport to get you out of there I tell you what you know we're staying in this hotel
[02:14:32] um Kasa Alamane house a German um by the water there and you know we got I got a first full
[02:14:41] room and it's a decent size room so I'm like get to them one night there so I'm like barricaded my door
[02:14:47] I got my Mark 43 setup ready to go my you know my car being ready to go I'm like okay Lord
[02:14:54] get me through this night I said if they're gonna get me they're gonna have to they're gonna have to work to get me
[02:14:59] you know so it was we were able to sleep or just stay awake all night thank you wrong the
[02:15:04] side of the car and just leave you know I had you know the belt you know down the feed tray
[02:15:11] cover shot you know you know the weapon cock bag but the safety on you know ready ready to go
[02:15:18] you know so they're gonna you know I'm gonna respond with a burst of gunfire they try to get
[02:15:22] through here you know so it was like you know you know I survived Afghanistan and then I'm gonna get
[02:15:30] um I'm gonna get hit in Honduras you know who's coming coming home like oh god Joe what are you
[02:15:37] what are you getting yourself into and you're volunteering for all this and at night in Honduras
[02:15:42] at night they would be all this you know fully automatic AK 47 gunfire and the couple who
[02:15:50] ran to hotel that just like celebratory fire or what is there fights going on I think a little bit
[02:15:56] of both and the people who were the preparators of the hotel said oh they're just killing
[02:16:01] chickens and killing old damn chickens in the middle of the night with AK's yeah be nothing left
[02:16:06] of the chicken you know so we roll back into the states and then we're doing our pre-deployment
[02:16:16] training um getting ready to go to my next turn Afghanistan so again we're in the fighting season
[02:16:27] you know time frame parameter and you know working with the specialized special ops units
[02:16:36] if you had to work with them before and you can probably know this there's a lot of Dick
[02:16:43] measuring going out check it's like who are you what can you do if they never work with you you
[02:16:50] know you know we weren't a special option it for say you know we're the best at DEA have
[02:16:56] but we could shoot moving communicate pretty good you know we could hold our own so a lot of times
[02:17:03] it took two or three missions are going out with people hey these guys are pretty good you know
[02:17:08] they're decent um so a lot of people thought that we going with these units and they would
[02:17:14] clear it and then we would come in after the fact that wasn't the case we erupt there for
[02:17:18] the front leading elements um so to get to my points we had our fast team before us that was there
[02:17:29] in Afghanistan and at the time a lot of the U.S. special ops units were doing these
[02:17:34] Phil's stability programs where they were going out and living with the people out you know
[02:17:39] in the villages and getting them to kind of see our way of thinking and views and values and
[02:17:46] you know we could talk for hours just about that but we won't get into that here today
[02:17:53] so
[02:17:57] no U.S. special ops units were available to direct action missions so the Australian
[02:18:02] Commandos stepped up hey we'll do it and they were operating they could only operate in the
[02:18:07] Helman province in Afghanistan and that's a pretty hot in Surgeon Area Surgeon Area of
[02:18:13] Activity and they have a lot of drug production goes on there and that's where we have a big
[02:18:18] base or camp levelling neck with the Marine Corps is so they were working our fast team came in
[02:18:26] and they saw we were good to go so when we got there we didn't have to go through all that
[02:18:32] rigmarole we just hit the ground running in fact the second op we did there that
[02:18:39] turned we hit the biggest heroin lab to date at that point of time in Afghanistan and it was
[02:18:46] just huge and they weren't used to us being in Helman so we weren't running into a lot of
[02:18:53] in place to IEDs because they weren't used to us being there but they were still putting up a
[02:19:01] hell of a fight you know if you're trying to take their money and oh hell no so we hit that huge
[02:19:10] lab we had how big is that lab like like is it they're producing at a time multiple hundred
[02:19:19] hundred kilos of heroin at a time and in fact when we came in they had a lot of a drying out
[02:19:27] we didn't know and you know the rotor wash of those seeds blew a lot of it away but there is
[02:19:32] a ton of chemicals and equipment left you know then we you know we can't take all the stuff with us so
[02:19:39] we we just take representative samples take photographs and destroy the rest of this stuff in place so
[02:19:45] we're you know in the process of destroying the stuff and we're running into a sporadic you know
[02:19:52] gunfire encounters we got one of our our part of force guys got shot in the lake and we
[02:19:59] had to bring them to a metavac and some a couple of the Australians got shot and we're processing
[02:20:07] this lab and I tell you the the Australian commandos there's not they're very very effective unit
[02:20:16] and very good you know I kind of put them on part so like maybe our army Rangers and they
[02:20:24] roll in pretty heavy when we roll into they will deploy snipers in their first to set up and if we're
[02:20:31] rolling heavy they'll bring a whole mortar company and everything too so we and that's where you
[02:20:40] started working with them they were being guided by the Aussies yeah we are being guided by the Australian
[02:20:45] also in the commandos okay that's who our partner force was and it's funny because like we be talking
[02:20:50] like this and you can kind of understand the Aussies and they have different slang words and stuff
[02:20:54] but under stress and under firefight you can understand what Taylor saying you're like can you
[02:21:00] ten nine that last please okay and my very best English accent this is what we want you to do
[02:21:10] so you know you know we had quite a few prisoners that they're just up and stuff and
[02:21:16] you know you're getting ready in the middle of the night you're loading them on this helicopter
[02:21:19] and they never seen helicopters up close you know so they're just looking around like
[02:21:23] I think it's like an alien spaceship and come on you come with us who are not going to execute you come on you know so
[02:21:31] we're we're ripped rolling through this tour we're just making some hell of a seizures
[02:21:40] so we're getting close we got like three weeks left to go it's getting close to Halloween
[02:21:46] and this bizarre pig bizarre and the northern helmet province pops up hot you know and these
[02:21:56] bizarre's out there like outdoor flea markets with like rolling garage doors and things and they
[02:22:01] saw everything from you know sundries and shampoo's chickens but also to include chemicals and
[02:22:09] equipment to manufacture heroin I eat the bar making material and small arms so this
[02:22:15] bizarre pops up hot and our team, the fast team that was there before us, Bravo team at hit the
[02:22:21] spazar with the Aussies and they seized a lot of items and they got in a pretty big gunfight
[02:22:29] and in fact the supervisor of the fast team Brett Hamilton who was in my selection he was
[02:22:37] Marine Corrofzer old tough crusty guy and we have the two oldest guys in our selection he's
[02:22:43] a little older than me they're fighting their way back to the helicopters and he ends up getting
[02:22:50] the forest gump wound the beach up in stung him he got shot in the buttocks hard or hard dude man he
[02:22:58] stayed the rest of the turret of they packed his wound he was still going out of since the so
[02:23:05] we knew we were going to run into some resistance but when we could hit it with the Aussies
[02:23:11] there wasn't an air-wain platform available with night vision capabilities that could fly us
[02:23:20] so we're like we really don't want to go during the day we want to use our technical advantages
[02:23:26] but we didn't have that option and we were our confidence was I think a little higher than it should have been
[02:23:39] you know they say you live by the sword you die by the sword so like we're gonna go so
[02:23:47] we're gonna use this air-wain that's training the Afghan pilots for when we left they could take
[02:23:54] over in do stuff and they were using old Russian MI 17 troop transport helicopters now it's a pretty
[02:24:01] robust helicopters not it not as big as our CH 47 but they move pretty fast and they get the door
[02:24:09] and the door gunners they got on one side of pk machine gun on the other side of gal mini gun
[02:24:15] and there's US contract pilots in there with with afghanies and there's one british guy british
[02:24:23] british ab8 or two so the night before they tell us okay um one of the helicopters you guys
[02:24:32] use in this guy gonna be all afghan crew and pilot it we're like oh we don't really want to be on
[02:24:40] that helicopter nor any of our oscis visit they decide that they're gonna get their g hot on that
[02:24:47] day and crash into a mountain don't want to be on that and they're not quite as skilled as our pilots
[02:24:54] so we're like okay we'll go but our afghan pounder for counterforce is gonna infill an
[02:25:02] ex-fill on that bird so we get a plan we're going to hit the bizarre early morning hours
[02:25:12] of october 31st 2011 just after first light and you know we want to get there when no people in the
[02:25:18] bizarre you know so we have to deal monkey around and deal with all that crap just get there
[02:25:23] we're gonna hit the spazard we're gonna hit another location after it so the plan was we arrived in
[02:25:31] three m i seven no four m i seventeen's some fast fast team members and australians are going to be in one
[02:25:40] the afghan pounder force is gonna be in another and then the australians are going to be in the other two birds
[02:25:46] and the australians are gonna land and kind of set up an outer perimeter to try to keep the
[02:25:55] enemy from maneuvering in on us but the only bad thing is it was a little bit of mountain this
[02:26:00] area so the enemy had the high ground on us and our afghan pounder force are gonna land in the
[02:26:08] helicopter they're gonna search this little village area right outside the bizarre we're gonna link up
[02:26:14] and then we're going to search the bizarre in two groups i was in charge of one of the elements made up of
[02:26:22] fast team members with some our afghan partner force and then one of our other guys was leading the other
[02:26:30] group so we land um start moving through hook up with the afghans and shortly after infill
[02:26:37] we receive start receiving sporadic incoming fire not very effective so we're moving through and
[02:26:47] we're finding poppy seed and stuff to manufacture heroin and i'm standing outside of one of the
[02:26:54] stalls and the bizarre behind this old gb dot car i hear a shot fired and i hear it hit the
[02:27:03] beat up car behind me and then i feel the back of my neck burn i'm like oh shit so i dive into the
[02:27:11] stall of the bizarre i put my hand on my back of my neck to see if any blood i don't see any blood
[02:27:16] on my glove i have whenever afghan translators look at it and he says oh it looks okay so
[02:27:23] but the bullet got so close i could feel the heat of the bullet burning the back of my neck
[02:27:27] so i kind of had my guard up after that and i'm like oh that's a close call joe so i kind of was
[02:27:34] using all my techniques and tactics i had learned throughout the years on the police department on
[02:27:40] the swat team as a DA agent as the DA fast training and prior missions so shortly after that
[02:27:48] over the little shitty loudspeaker system they have over there the insurgency to a call the arms
[02:27:54] today's your day to die we must kill the infidels we must drive them out of our land
[02:28:02] so incoming gunfire really increases so we really hear the Aussies get into it with them
[02:28:10] and you're still in the bizarre at this point we're still in a bizarre and the Aussies are on external
[02:28:14] security yes and we have the marine air wing providing close air support and we hear the the
[02:28:21] marine air wing get into it the Aussies get into it so we're finishing up what we have to do
[02:28:28] we're taking the samples taking photographs and starting to destroy all the stuff so we do that
[02:28:36] and we say okay we're like 10 mic ten minutes out and we'll be ready to move so we start calling
[02:28:43] our birds to come get us so they're inbound and we have to make our way to our x-fill locations
[02:28:50] we're only about a couple a couple hundred meters away not far but we get bogged down in the gunfire
[02:28:57] so we can't make our x-fill positions in time so we have to wave the helicopter's off
[02:29:04] so they go a distance away but keep the rotor spinning so you know at this time you know
[02:29:10] like moving in between mud huts and you know you're leapfrogging and you're like
[02:29:17] how you know I know we have to get the helicopter here because the longer we stay the more the enemy
[02:29:23] has time to amass you know and it's not going to be good but you know in combat you can't show
[02:29:32] fear to other people on your team or squad even though you're feeling like I don't know
[02:29:38] for going to get the helicopter you know so you're moving and we finally get set up in our
[02:29:43] x-fill positions afghans and they're a little spot and us in the Aussie so the four helicopters
[02:29:49] come in and we're receiving pretty heavy incoming fire two to include belt fed machine gun fire
[02:29:57] don't we don't we call any RPGs so the four helicopters come in and we got the afghan crew
[02:30:04] and pilot helicopter that one we're never going to get on in a million years and three land
[02:30:11] guess which one doesn't land the afghan crew and pilot helicopter and after worries they said
[02:30:18] because of the brownout conditions with the other copters helicopters picking up all the dust and
[02:30:23] rotor wash and all the incoming fire they didn't feel comfortable landing so instead of waiting
[02:30:31] for their bird to come guess what the afghans do pile on to the next helicopter and it's ours
[02:30:37] so they get their first we're in this open field we run out there we're like get the hell off
[02:30:44] they're not moving I don't blame them I want to go back into that hell so instead of being
[02:30:49] shot in this open damn field we're like okay just go so the three helicopters lift off
[02:30:56] and then it's us fast team members and several Aussies so we're coming to guys are left on the ground
[02:31:02] um my 10 15 of you yeah at max we had from fast we had we had Jared just in two mats
[02:31:19] brence
[02:31:21] Paul
[02:31:24] myself and a couple Aussies you're like under 10 so of course all the fires focused on us it
[02:31:32] disappoint so we take cover in a little ditch and then our helicopter short time lands about
[02:31:38] 100 meters away and this the one we're never gonna get on the crew and pilot helicopter
[02:31:43] so they land and I remember saying to myself of course you're heart racing
[02:31:48] feel like I get to get a lot of here I remember saying to myself this is gonna be a shitty run
[02:31:55] you know there's bullets is popping up everywhere so I but I knew we couldn't stay
[02:31:59] hey so one of the last memories I kind of have from that day is I get up to run
[02:32:09] I remember firing a couple shots on the run towards the direction I felt in surgeons were fire
[02:32:13] in at us from I guess I got the helicopter about mid pack and that's when I paused and was providing
[02:32:20] fire for the rest of my teammates to get honored near the helicopter and then once that happened my
[02:32:27] team leader Jarajanson said let's roll I guess and that's when I turned left to run out to the
[02:32:34] helicopter and then I got hit in the head at first he thought I fell and he's trying to
[02:32:41] rouse me and I'm not moving I'm face first in the ground and then he rolls me over and he sees
[02:32:48] the like ballistic class as I was wearing were shattered and he sees a hole in my head
[02:32:53] so they roll me over and they're thinking I'm dead which is very you know
[02:33:02] very possible situation here you can take around to the head and so they grabbed me scooped me up
[02:33:10] throw me in helicopter that's when breads and you know he's put when covered fire down
[02:33:15] Matt Stewart's trying to get the Afghan doorgunners to fire they're not even firing
[02:33:19] and helicopters getting shot up you know we're getting shot and he's like shoot shoot shoot say
[02:33:26] fire a couple rounds you know burst into the ground so he's like no shoot shoot he takes you know he
[02:33:30] grabs the gun and starts shooting a little bit so they throw me on the helicopter and you know they
[02:33:39] think I'm dead you know the helicopter is very loud and they're of course and everything so you can't
[02:33:42] hear breathing so one of my teammates Justin Vanderbilt who actually before DEA he was a medic
[02:33:52] in New Orleans and he was there during Katrina so he was kind of like one of our more highly
[02:33:58] trained kind of our version of like 18 Delta medical guy even though we all go through pretty intense
[02:34:04] tea triple sea combat care and actually live tissue training and stuff he's like he's alive he's
[02:34:13] breathing so they start getting my stuff cut out and they apply combat gauze to my head wounds
[02:34:25] which is gauze with clotting agent in there so they're getting that under control
[02:34:30] and then a lot of times with facial wounds or different that have wounds you want to try to
[02:34:34] establish a better airway and you know and you can do that by a couple different ways you can
[02:34:40] do a cry chorea cut you know under the person's throat and you insert an implementer helping
[02:34:45] breathe more or you can use a nasal fair and gill airway and they decide they're going to
[02:34:52] stick a nasal fair and gill airway up my nose and in training we have to insert these in
[02:34:58] any other and just sort of a nose this is like a it's basically like a you shaped tube that you
[02:35:06] cram and someone's nose that will open up the airway between your nostrils and like your
[02:35:12] lungs not all the way down your lungs but like through your head you know they're probably
[02:35:16] what do you think they are Joe like maybe five inches long total something like that and one end
[02:35:20] looks like there's a funnel on there and the other and you know in training we can put light
[02:35:26] a cane in our nose before we do it but it still sucks or no offense attended we're training
[02:35:35] with the seals they allow us to spit out a mistake he's up and he's not fun and when they're
[02:35:42] cramming this up my nose I come to I don't remember any of this it's probably a good thing
[02:35:48] um I'm talking making sense I recognize people's voices I'm not complaining about my head even
[02:36:00] I have a hole on each set I decide I say get it out of my eyes the pressure from the high
[02:36:08] velocity round which we think was the armoured person around from Belvedpe K machine gun
[02:36:15] traveling through my head ruptured both my eye globes into touch both redness
[02:36:20] so they poor saline solutions on my eyes of course that doesn't do jack crap
[02:36:25] and then I'm telling them I gotta move my leg
[02:36:30] so they think I'm shot in the leg too with all the gunfire that was coming at us
[02:36:35] and this particular mission I did not have my Belvedpe machine gun I had my
[02:36:39] carbine with a suppressor on it and I had been shooting quite a bit so when I got knocked on
[02:36:45] conscious I fell on the barrel of my rifle and it burned inside of my left leg real bad
[02:36:54] and actually the cry pants I was wearing it were burned you know they were burned
[02:36:58] and they you know they burned my leg pretty good so they're you know they're working on me and you
[02:37:06] know they're getting me back to the base as quick as possible and on my team
[02:37:11] made said the thing that scared them even when the bleeding stopped my head just kept
[02:37:15] swallowing up and swallowing up they knew there's nothing they could do there but luckily for me
[02:37:23] the helicopter's there when I got shot so you know I usually take the time now to
[02:37:31] talk about some of the things that I think led to my survivability is that you know even though
[02:37:40] I was severely wounded by my team providing that fast medical attention they had stalled my
[02:37:47] decompensation giving time for me to get the higher care and I know it's not invoked at times
[02:37:57] or this and that but for all instances I should be dead talking to the medical professionals over
[02:38:05] 80% of the people who get my injury do not survive and the day I became a police officer my
[02:38:14] mother gave me a saint Michael's medallion it's a patron saint the protect police officers
[02:38:18] and always carrying one on me I had one in my kit I always did the Psalm 91 prayer before I went on
[02:38:26] missions and carried a copy on me that's the prayer of soldiers going into battle for the Lord to
[02:38:32] protect you and I had one of my grandfather's dog takes a war war two on me and he was not my time to go
[02:38:43] the Lord had more for me to do I think some of that is me doing my motivational speaking now
[02:38:49] helping others deal with situations and instances and it just was not my time to go and then with all
[02:38:59] our high speed medical training that we had once my teammates found that I was alive nobody panicked
[02:39:07] unfortunately over there we had to use our medical training more than when we had a light
[02:39:11] so that and also you know I talk about mindset you know you have to have this mindset
[02:39:22] that if you're in a fight for your life or you're with a suspect or an enemy you're fighting for
[02:39:29] your life or getting in a shootout or it could be you could be at home you could have an accident or
[02:39:36] drive a car if you're in a fight you have to survive you have to fight you have to hit
[02:39:42] claw scratch god whatever you have to do you have to think yourself I am not going to lose this fight
[02:39:49] I am not going to lose I'm going to survive I'm going to make it through that you have to have that
[02:39:56] mental attitude you know I kind of call it the warriors mindset or the winning mentality
[02:40:04] that I'm going to survive and make it through this you know there's no way I'm not going to
[02:40:10] make it through even though at first I was not unconscious my body my mind didn't give up
[02:40:21] you're going to you're going to make it through this show you know I didn't see any bright light or
[02:40:25] anything I may have saw a little fire below or something it wasn't it wasn't time
[02:40:31] so also talking to the doctors I was in really great physical shape when I got shot
[02:40:42] and the better shape you're in a lot of times the more traumatic injury you can survive
[02:40:49] and a lot of times the better your recovery is you know so when I talk to groups you know
[02:40:55] especially military law enforcement groups you know I tell people you don't have to be Olympic
[02:40:59] athlete but please please please be in the best shape you can because it may save your life you
[02:41:05] never know like I said it could be a car accident in your end or you could fall over ladder at the
[02:41:09] house you know just please stay in the best shape that you can so we fly back to the base
[02:41:19] tearing count which we're staying at with the Aussies so we land at and they're field there and
[02:41:25] the ambulance comes out to meet us and they don't bring a stretcher to the bird they think
[02:41:31] they had me on the stretcher even though we have them they didn't have me on one so I
[02:41:37] hear this commotion going on so guess what the guy shot in the head does he gets off the walk off the
[02:41:44] helicopter my team I said no Joe we got you who will carry you so they carry me to the ambulance
[02:41:52] bring me to the medical facility there they do what they can for me there do you remember trying
[02:41:58] to get up and walk no I don't I don't remember talking to my teammates and the helicopter none of
[02:42:04] that all of our remembers firing a couple shots on the run because you know talking to the doctors
[02:42:10] because I guess you know when I got hit it was just lights out and it's kind of your brains
[02:42:15] mechanism for texture and I'm probably glad I don't remember any of that stuff so they brought me
[02:42:22] the medical facility there they knocked me unconscious did what they can for me there and then
[02:42:29] they make arrangements to fly me in a metavac helicopter to can to our airfield which they had
[02:42:36] a near-search and an eye surgeon standing by so I'm flown over there with one of my teammates
[02:42:43] Matt Stewart we arrived there so they of course they do an assessment on me there and it was
[02:42:51] fortunate for me that day it was Halloween so not a lot of groups were doing or units were doing
[02:42:57] missions so they didn't have many casualties in the hospital there so they first taken look at me
[02:43:05] and I guess I'm starting to be kept alive with basic life-saving procedures at this time and
[02:43:14] they don't think there's anything they can do to save me so they're just going to have me
[02:43:19] pass peacefully and then have me set home back home on an angel flight deceased but the doctor
[02:43:27] then they're certain he's pretty aggressive guy and then the the nurse it in took me there
[02:43:32] and he's looking at me he's talking to my teammates you know my teammate that I was talking
[02:43:39] after and now I got up to walk off I was trying to get whatever's in my eyes out and he sees what's
[02:43:44] shape I'm in he's convinced that if he gets in and performs surgery that they can get the
[02:43:55] bleeding in my head stopped and some of the pressure relieved in least get me home to the
[02:44:00] state so my family can see me didn't know what condition I was going to be and even though
[02:44:05] I you know I was talking in the helicopter and he had to decide whether I could survive even
[02:44:15] what he was going to do to me during surgery and he felt strongly that I had the wheel that I
[02:44:24] wasn't going to die and he told me after the fact with brain injuries and head injuries he said
[02:44:32] there was a smell that somebody gave off that he could tell if they weren't going to make it
[02:44:36] turn out and he said I did not have that smell and they had nurse there you know they're
[02:44:43] bickering back and forth whether you know he's fighting in the command whether they should use
[02:44:47] their resources to save me and I guess there's a line in the hospital there once you cross
[02:44:54] over that line surgery has to take the patient you can't push him back so the head nurse at the
[02:45:02] time which I'm still friends with I'm not going to mention her name because I don't want to
[02:45:06] get in any trouble push me over that line so surgery had to take me so they began to operate on
[02:45:16] me the neurosurgeon spend approximately four and a half hours operating on me they actually
[02:45:22] moved the whole frontal skull piece off my head my frontal all my frontal forehead is now titanium
[02:45:32] they got the bleeding stopped they got they put a valve in there to regulate my pressure
[02:45:39] and then the eye surgeon came in and he's like she's like talking to the main doctors like he's
[02:45:45] really survivable am I going to spend all this work on somebody where he's just going to be sent home
[02:45:51] in a box and that was a possibility but he says I think you know he's gonna make it show she
[02:45:58] spent approximately eight hours piecing my eyes back together with a microscope and there's work she
[02:46:07] did has given me the opportunity in the future to be able to potentially see more my left eye
[02:46:16] has some light perception and I can see some moving in my left eye and I can see them shapes so
[02:46:21] there's a bigger color contrast between light and dark so she piece of my eyes back together so
[02:46:29] the next day one of my best friends and my unit he wasn't on another part of the country trying to
[02:46:34] get some other ops together he makes it there and he flies back and roots the states with me
[02:46:40] of course they have me on this big I guess medical plane you know pretty much each patient has their own
[02:46:48] nurse and everything and we're in route back to the states and of course they're then in my family
[02:46:53] know what happened and everything and at the time I was engaged and I told my fans at the time I said
[02:47:02] don't if I can't get a hold of you you can't get a hold of me I'm out of an op when I get back in
[02:47:08] will Skype or in all text you are call you I said only worry if two people come knocking on the door
[02:47:18] so she was a nurse she worked night shift and she Afghanistan was like eight hours hours different
[02:47:24] and she here's a knock on the door that morning she had back from work and she goes to the
[02:47:30] door and she sees two gentlemen through the window she doesn't recommend and they put their badges
[02:47:34] out and she's like oh shit so she opens the door and she starts balling they're like he's not dead
[02:47:42] he's insurgery we don't know but he's alive at this point so they get all my family notified and
[02:47:49] everything and then we had to fly over to law and stole Germany and they have pretty good medical
[02:47:55] thing there with my buddy Travis and it was the pressure my head was rising they kept me there for
[02:48:00] three nights and then they flew me to Andrew's Air Force Base I was gonna say dover but you don't
[02:48:11] want to make it a dover is that means you're dead so they flew me to Andrew's and then had all my
[02:48:18] family at the hospital and all the people from D.A. and everything that the higher ups and you know
[02:48:23] some of the other people on that team's waiting to receive me so they take me be ambulance over to
[02:48:29] Walter Reed National Naval Medical Hospital and Bethesda Maryland so they when I arrived they let my family
[02:48:39] see me they plan on doing some other surgeries there but of course I'm a mess I have no frontal
[02:48:45] skull piece my head's okay didn I guess you know I'm swollen I got a tube coming out and
[02:48:51] almost every part of my body and they let my family see me and at the time
[02:48:58] my fiance was a intensive care nurse she's seen a lot of trauma a lot of bad things but I
[02:49:09] guess when she saw me of course when it's your loved ones it's different she put her hand on
[02:49:14] them out screamed ran out of the room and passed out her dad had to help her off the floor you know
[02:49:20] it's when it's somebody you love and care about it's different so they brought me in there they
[02:49:26] did some surgeries on me they reattached my retinas they cleaned up my head area more
[02:49:34] and preparation for putting my plate on my metal plate that I have now on later
[02:49:40] they don't want to put it on too quick was a chance of rejection is greater and everything so
[02:49:45] they want to wait so they do that and then they put me in an induced coma
[02:49:54] with that that profile you know want to maybe call it the Michael Jackson drug the one
[02:50:01] Michael Jackson used to sleep got on rest Michael Jackson you know got rest of soul it works
[02:50:06] very good for putting people in a coma because you can reverse them real quick but not necessarily
[02:50:11] it's not not necessarily prescribed for sleep so they had me on that and they had me
[02:50:18] intubated and everything so they had me an induced coma for about a week and then when they
[02:50:23] were getting ready to bring me out of the coma they didn't know how I was going to be even though
[02:50:29] I was talking and making sense on the helicopter and all that with the additional trauma of the
[02:50:35] surgeries they wouldn't know if I could speak at all but I remember anything what I have my same personality
[02:50:42] but they certainly surely after they learned I was the same smart ass Joe I was before
[02:50:47] you know I was looking for you as the first they asked me you know where do you live
[02:50:54] I'm like oh Detroit Michigan what do you do? I'm a police officer what's your dog's name
[02:50:59] I said Max I was my very first dog I had when I was a kid but I soon surely after I got my bearings
[02:51:05] I knew who I was at the particular time I knew was working for and everything so then started my road to
[02:51:14] recovery you know so now I'm blind I'm not an abesh you know best condition physically at this
[02:51:24] particular time because of the injuries you know so they began to start my recovery process
[02:51:33] and I was on a feeding tube for a while so they had to pull that out and they trick you
[02:51:39] they say okay we're gonna pull us out on three one two like oh you didn't wait for three I was like
[02:51:49] I'm like we say that because we want to catch you by surprise you don't want you to say three
[02:51:53] then pull and then you tighten it and it makes it worse so I had to learn how to eat solid food
[02:51:59] and I failed a couple swallows studies at first and you know of course I'm losing weights by the
[02:52:05] minute because I'm not being active and the people at the hospital those he's got a lot of muscle he's in good shape
[02:52:10] you know he's and Mike's wife said to time where I experience a you didn't see him before
[02:52:16] so we started making them feed me you know like insure in between meals and stuff to try to put some
[02:52:21] more weight on and we do things like okay today your task is okay Joe have you put your shorts on
[02:52:27] and your t-shirt and your socks you know how long is it going to take you nice it you know obviously five
[02:52:32] or ten minutes or whatever so the one time I'm sitting there with the physical therapist and my
[02:52:38] X and I'm feeling these shorts and I'm like these don't feel like my size I'm like what size are these
[02:52:48] and of course my X doesn't say anything like a church mouse she's like she knows she's
[02:52:52] tumble with size they are I'm gonna throw a hissy fit so the therapist says let me see I'll tell you
[02:53:01] she goes there medium I took those shorts I threw them across your my son I'm a big fellow I
[02:53:06] were extra large if I would have put those extra large shorts and everybody would fell straight to the floor
[02:53:11] because when I got shot I was probably 230's really lean and they would weigh me on the bed every day
[02:53:18] I was down I got down to like 160 something so those shorts would what was the time frame for that
[02:53:25] like a month two months I spent two months there not she's not not long so we got over that and then I was I was confused and then
[02:53:40] of course my I doctor he was his name was Dr. Chung there and it's very serious man
[02:53:45] someone day we're sitting in my room my father's there with me and my team made Travis and Dr. Chung
[02:53:51] walks in and Travis is like Dr. Chung I want to tell you Joe thinks he's African American
[02:54:00] I was all jacked up so I'm talking in acting like an inner city African American guy and
[02:54:06] then going everything Dr. Chung like are you serious and Travis is yes and then my dad's like well he is from Detroit
[02:54:15] so Dr. Chung about it's pretty serious but I don't he acted that way for a couple of days you know
[02:54:23] and then I got my bearings back so yeah it you know it progressed there and they did everything
[02:54:30] they can for me there and then they let me start doing like a little bit of work out stuff there and they brought
[02:54:37] me to like the little PT Jim area and they're like okay we're gonna have you do like some
[02:54:43] little dumbbell stuff and like okay tell me which way or the one 20s yeah with the way you know
[02:54:49] tell me it's good I said these are too heavy no these are too heavy these are too heavy okay these are good
[02:54:55] and then I found out after the fact actually Joe those were the pink dumbbells you were using
[02:54:59] oh no really by two pounds oh okay I'm getting it work you know yeah yeah you know so
[02:55:07] it did that and they start you know teaching you how to operate blind and I don't know for some
[02:55:15] goofy reason I thought I didn't have any skin on my head where my brain was I thought it was just like
[02:55:21] mesh so they're like Joe you need to take a shower we need to get your shower I'm like I can't get my
[02:55:28] brain wet and Max was like Joe you have skin there I'm like oh I do so you kind of lose all your
[02:55:35] dignity you gotta go in the shower with this you know this nurse or whatever they're all
[02:55:39] gowned up and all this rubber gear and you just you know standard with your birthday suit on
[02:55:44] but naked I'm like guess I'm taking the shower you know it's so how long was this you know recovery
[02:55:51] process how long did you stay with it was this still taking place at Bethesda yes that was there for
[02:55:56] two months two months when so you lost freaking whatever you went from 230 to 160 something yes
[02:56:04] and now you start rebuilding yes and and when you start rebuilding is that really starts take place
[02:56:11] when you get out of Bethesda yes was they transferred me down to the McGuire V.A. down in
[02:56:21] Richmond Virginia you know after that so it was kind of nice but we're getting close to Christmas
[02:56:27] time now ish and so on the weekends they let me go home as long as I came back Sunday night
[02:56:37] and I got to go home for the holidays and then we became started doing a lot learning there a lot
[02:56:42] more how to operate in a blind world like use the blind cane use some of the voice over stuff like
[02:56:50] on the computer and things like that and I began to let me start working out more there you know
[02:56:59] so during this time I'm like I don't know what's going to happen to me or not happen to me and
[02:57:06] how like our administrator at the time her name was Michelle Lynn a hard she was like in charge of us
[02:57:13] yes my buddy Travis what is Joa he's like Joa wants to keep working she goes will make it happen
[02:57:19] so even the I didn't meet the physical requirements to be a DA agent anymore they kept me honest
[02:57:25] a DA agent after this because they figured out the money you make a lot more retiring as a regular
[02:57:31] agent rather than taking a medical disability so they kind of hooked me up and during my stay in
[02:57:39] Walter Reed Bethesda hearing my teammates and my parents talk about they're supposed to bring
[02:57:51] all these wounded service members back home overseas tore up bad the line is a younger kids
[02:57:57] when this happened to me I was like 41 years old I lived a pretty damn good life
[02:58:02] and a lot of these kids maybe not married maybe newly married maybe just had some
[02:58:11] you know a child and you know their life is drastically changed forever so when I would have my
[02:58:17] pity party and why me woe was me you know I would say Jo it always could be worse somebody always
[02:58:27] has it worse than you you know you can't control what you don't have anymore all you can do
[02:58:36] it's working work with what you have now so in life when bad things happen we can make a couple
[02:58:46] choices we can let life pass us by or we can get out there and do as much as we can do and I made
[02:58:54] a commitment to myself that I'm going to try to do as much blind as when I could see I didn't know
[02:59:01] how that was going to look but I made that commitment and when there's a will there's a way
[02:59:11] if you want to figure out how to do stuff and make stuff happen it may not be the same way you
[02:59:16] used to do it it may take you a lot longer but if you really want to do something bad enough you can do
[02:59:25] it so I made that commitment right there right then and I tell people when I talk it's not been
[02:59:33] easy every day's a struggle for me I still wake up every day blind you know I've had a very
[02:59:39] serious severe traumatic brain injury I've had I've pretty bad PTSD because of it and I've done
[02:59:48] stuff to manage and mitigate that and you know when I talk you know with the amount of suicide
[02:59:55] from service members in this and that you know a lot of us want to play work tough and it doesn't
[03:00:00] affect us and this and that but you can't get help unless you admit you have it and ask for the help
[03:00:07] as there are things and things out there and I got the Stelik gangly and block shot which helps
[03:00:12] for PTSD you have a Stelik land in your neck when you have PTSD that land gets all screwed up
[03:00:19] and they go in and dead in the gland and it's kind of like reboots your brain and your computer
[03:00:23] and it helps you tremendously you know so there's things things out there so there's things that
[03:00:31] I've went on and done since I've been blind I've turned them skydive jumped and a buddy of mine
[03:00:41] his wife on Monterey California runs a skydiving place and before I wanted to turn them jump but
[03:00:48] I'm always kind of been over the weight limit and he says for a tandem he's like what you know
[03:00:54] what are you gonna weigh Jocelyn about 240 right now and I knew I couldn't be over two he says come up
[03:01:01] it will make it happen so he's when we weighed in his wife on the places tell me way 230
[03:01:08] so my tandem guy this jump with me takes look at me so we're gonna fall real quick you're like
[03:01:13] how far do you want to how hard do you want to jump Joe? Is it high as we can go? So I guess we
[03:01:19] jumped at 16,000 feet wow and I guess that's the highest you can go without we should go without
[03:01:25] ox you know you know any higher neck you want to be on oxygen and any higher in that you need to get
[03:01:31] FAA approval so we were the first ones that go out of the bird and I don't know if it's worse being able
[03:01:37] to see or not you know we jumped out of a king air you know the open that door and that wind's
[03:01:45] just rushing you know where the first they tell you what to do you know and we're gonna rock back
[03:01:50] on you know one two three then go and then you know put your arms back and then how to land properly
[03:01:56] and stuff but it was it was definitely a kick in the pants I'm gonna do it again probably yes
[03:02:02] with him I'm nuts and even in the hospital we're talking about my frontal brain low bangery
[03:02:08] the doctors told my parents we can never be trusted with a credit card anymore he might just
[03:02:12] be at work and take all this clothes off my mom's like wait in make good decisions to be
[03:02:17] again with so he's not gonna lose much there it affected me to an extent but didn't affect
[03:02:24] me to the extent where it could have thankfully so I also do I kind of I couldn't shoot blind
[03:02:32] with special optics so how does that work um on top of your rifle where scope would
[03:02:39] sit you have like it's like a high speed video camera that has built in Wi-Fi and it projects to
[03:02:49] a tablet or a smartphone and basically it'll show on tablet or a smartphone like a site picture
[03:02:57] of a scope and you got to you know a system gunner a gunner and they tell me left right
[03:03:03] up or down and as long as I my breathing is controlled and I don't jerk the trigger I can hit a pie
[03:03:09] plate of 300 meters every time since I've been blind I've shot five deer two bucks and three
[03:03:18] dose I got two alligators in Louisiana with a we had a glass pistol with a laser sight and I
[03:03:27] remember before watching that show swamp people and I can see I said they're nuts I said you would
[03:03:32] never catch me in a million years doing that so opportunity came up hey Joe you want to go get her
[03:03:39] hunting oh yeah sure I guess that goes back to my poor decision making and I take it there was
[03:03:45] some pucker factor going on there buddy so I'm with another guy from fast and we were with the
[03:03:50] guy we were with his brother as a de agent and he with this guy works and then the oil business out
[03:03:59] and Louisiana in northern area and he does the gator hunting so we go to our couple of our lines
[03:04:07] and if the listeners and whoever said they've ever seen how they catch them you have a big
[03:04:14] like trouble hook with chicken on it and they set them up in the gator by such a game and
[03:04:20] gets caught in this hook and then you have to go and pull the gator up and then you got a shoot him
[03:04:25] now in the show like swamp people they gank on the line to try to get the gator to go nuts for
[03:04:31] the atrics for tv now how you want to do it you want to pull them off slow so they don't fight
[03:04:37] and a gator can only stand or water for so long and yada yada yada yada so we pulled to the first
[03:04:43] couple lines and they're not touched so we pulled to the third line and he's like oh shit we got a big one
[03:04:49] he goes on the bank he's got the chicken in his mouth he's about a ten footer so we roll up in this
[03:04:57] little John boat and we get to the line and the guy started to pull him in so on my my knees
[03:05:06] I got this clock with the laser sight on it 40 caliber clock you know and I could just press the
[03:05:11] the pattern laser sight you know when we're ready and he can kind of guide me in for the shot
[03:05:15] so we're he's pulling the gator in and the gator gets under the boat he's like oh shit
[03:05:25] so he's like okay we're not going to force this he's got eventually come up
[03:05:32] so I'm thinking you got the gator snout not too far from me I'm on my knees and I'm like Joe
[03:05:38] what the hell you doing out here I'm like you're blind and at this gator snaps
[03:05:44] to bite you you can't even see the jump back and then these locals are gonna be up
[03:05:49] you know we're gonna see after the fact that's certain right ain't no blind guy in no business
[03:05:53] out there anyway even tailed that guy even to see the blind out there hunting alligator to get my arm
[03:05:58] bit off so believe me there was some pucker factor so the gator starts
[03:06:04] I like the fact that not only your little word you might lose your arm from a gator but you also
[03:06:08] don't want to look stupid and for exactly for you know it's always a key thing you got to look cool
[03:06:13] you know you can there now there's the blind guy one hour you know so the gator starts fighting
[03:06:23] a little bit and the guy is like shit he bent the hook and got off so he's like okay keep your eye
[03:06:31] on my buddies there with his pistol and he's got he takes the glock he's got a surface
[03:06:37] he can only stay down for so long so he goes look for the bubble so he goes I see bubbles
[03:06:41] he he goes he's coming up so he shoots some pow it's a head hit some again pow and the buddy
[03:06:49] I'm with he so I shoot him too he goes yeah so he shoots some so we go over to the gator
[03:06:55] and then we push him to the shore to try to get this big SOB on the boat
[03:07:01] so as we're trying to get him on the boat I hear another shot the gators already got three
[03:07:06] bullets in his head he opens his eyes again so the guy hits him in the head again hit he's done so
[03:07:12] he got this big big gator on the boat so it takes off all the rooms so we have to drop him off
[03:07:17] to try to check other lines and we went to our next line he had like a nine foot around there
[03:07:22] and he was putting up more of a fight and I got to shoot that one twice so that was kind of
[03:07:28] kind of interesting how box actually I was in Sun Valley Idaho last year
[03:07:35] during hyperbaric oxygen train retreatments because it increases stem saw activity
[03:07:42] trying to get a little more sight back and I got to downhill snow ski three times
[03:07:46] I did that when I was younger and it's kind of kind of counterintuitive a skin you want to lean forward
[03:07:53] in blind you don't want to lean forward when you're walking but you want to crack your head on things
[03:07:58] and I've actually got stitches a couple times and my eyebrows since I lost my sight but I was in a hurry
[03:08:03] so that was fun that was on my bucket list I tried slalom water skiing at our cottage up
[03:08:10] north this last year I used to ski a lot when I was young I just I popped up but I couldn't get my
[03:08:17] other foot in the rear boot I couldn't my balance was off with blind so I tried a couple times
[03:08:22] and at least I tried so I did that I ran 5k races blind and I've actually
[03:08:32] lost July I as you know I'm a little guy I became the first blind I have been me men's
[03:08:43] pro bodybuilder in history got my pro card so I did that and you know the sky's the limit you know
[03:08:53] there's different things you know you can do and you can't cry over spilled milk and you can
[03:08:59] just control what you can control and a lot of people ask me you know what are some of the hardest
[03:09:05] things getting used to being blind you I think one of the biggest thing you lose your independence
[03:09:12] I just can't get in the car and go somewhere myself or if I want to work out I just can't go by
[03:09:16] myself and so you have to rely on other people and you know I'm typical like the you know the law
[03:09:24] enforcement guy or the real type A what do I think by myself you know you can't you know if
[03:09:30] you're following behind and I'm just gonna take over you know you know you want to do it right
[03:09:35] do it yourself I have to learn how to slow it out and trust other people and which was probably
[03:09:40] good for me I had to learn to ask for help I wasn't good at that before but lucky I have a very good
[03:09:47] base of friends and teammates and family and DEA has really stepped up since I've been hurt
[03:09:56] myself or my family has never been without anything and at first being in crowds really freaked me out
[03:10:04] because being in law enforcement for as long as I have you're always taught to be aware
[03:10:10] you're surroundings I know you're not supposed to you know I'm trying to think of the
[03:10:24] word you know oh god it'll come to me but I was getting on this subject I was getting
[03:10:37] debriefed by like a psychologist situation and really we I felt that some form they're like
[03:10:44] one of the things was like you know do you feel comfortable in crowds and I said you feel comfortable
[03:10:51] in crowds and I was like well no and so you know those side card trist it's a female she looks
[03:10:58] at you see you know you she said you say you don't feel very comfortable in crowds and this was like
[03:11:03] I mean I I was back for my rack but you know whatever a little bit of time and she says you
[03:11:08] don't feel very comfortable in crowds and I said well no not really and she goes well why is that
[03:11:13] and I go well you know this terrors in America right yeah and she looked like she like whatever
[03:11:20] she started taking copious notes you know about my mental health or whatever which I was just like
[03:11:25] hey it's a reality you know it's a reality you know it's a reality you know it was always
[03:11:29] want to be aware of your surroundings okay where are my entrances where are my exit you know
[03:11:34] who looks suspicious who doesn't you know you're not trying to like stare you know type people but
[03:11:40] it's all what doesn't look right and at first being blind things sound to people
[03:11:49] were sound to closer than what they were or farther than what they were I was just real uneasy
[03:11:55] but over time I'd learn to deal with that so I'm not as jittery and stuff as I once was I just
[03:12:01] learned to you know trust the people around me and so you know that's one of the things people asked
[03:12:10] me do I have a service dog I don't I put in for one but then I got my left eye I had a chance to
[03:12:19] get an artificial corny in my left eye and they thought I could get back more vision than I did
[03:12:24] so I didn't want to take a dog from somebody who needed it more and the art of the
[03:12:28] person corny helped me seal a little better but not as much as we had hoped for so I still might
[03:12:37] get a service dog in the future they're pretty incredible what they can do. Yeah very incredible and
[03:12:45] you know people asked me do I get headaches and stuff like that and no I never had a headache thank
[03:12:49] God because people asked that question and you know they ask me you know what is you know what can
[03:12:57] you see what can you can see like I said earlier I can see shapes I can see light I can see some movement
[03:13:04] and I chart my left eye is 2400 to 2500 depending on the day anything over 2200 is the
[03:13:12] glee blind my right eye is nothing that's the side of bullet one into. I doctor shines of light I said
[03:13:18] I can think I can see a light but there's future with my left eye I have artificial cornea so
[03:13:29] there's help the thing is limiting my sight is my optic nerve and retina still very damaged
[03:13:34] but they are working on stem cell for that to regenerate that and they're still fairly confident
[03:13:41] in two to five years I could get more sight back which which would be nice and if I do that would
[03:13:50] be great but if not you know I'm still gonna keep soldier and on and do what you know and do what the hell
[03:13:57] you know I can do and they said you know you don't want to be the first for anything you want to
[03:14:01] let them work the kinks out of this this stuff first you know before we had all this mess with
[03:14:06] China you heard him doing the stem cells and everything over there and I asked my doctor so I go to the
[03:14:10] S best eye doctors that I can now to like you don't want to go over there Joe when the technology is good
[03:14:17] and it works we'll have it here too so you know just on standby to stand by for that
[03:14:25] you know so you know we'll keep going that I do my motivational speaking which gives me purpose now
[03:14:32] you know we've been you know took jobs and different things we're to serve people and serve the
[03:14:36] community I can't do my job the way I have in the past but for me to get up there and talk to
[03:14:44] people and tell my story one is therapeutic for me too to talk about it and two if somebody's
[03:14:53] having a bad day a bad year or bad whatever that the sea there's always somebody that has it
[03:15:01] worse it always could be worse so you know you got to count the blessings you have and be thankful
[03:15:08] for the things that you still have you can't cry about what you don't have anymore all you can just
[03:15:15] do is move on so you know I'm gonna continue doing the motivational speaking which is good you know
[03:15:22] and there's been groups I've talked to where I've got after action reports where people in the audience
[03:15:28] have we're gonna commit suicide and they heard me talk and they said my life's really not that bad
[03:15:36] you know I can do it you know so I tell people you know if I can do it you can do it you know I
[03:15:42] always had a strong will and I've always been very stubborn I kind of helped me survive but the
[03:15:47] stubbornness isn't always a good in relationships you know it was like it'd be a pain in the
[03:15:52] butt just asked my girlfriend you know and I do really preach the PTSD part two was
[03:16:02] losing way too many men and women for that so if you had you have it and I always knew I had it
[03:16:10] but I didn't get better until I admitted I had it but it's why I was still working I was afraid I was
[03:16:16] gonna lose my security clearance and this and that and in all actuality I would not have but you know
[03:16:24] there's things and treatments and things you can do for that like the Stelegangly and Block Shot is
[03:16:30] one a great thing for that you know finding a good fit with a therapist you know that
[03:16:37] you know can work with you so all those things important so to me I tell people
[03:16:40] it's my show to say you have it it's not my show to have it and say you don't have it you know
[03:16:48] so don't be you know a tough guy or tough gal there's help out there please you know seek that help
[03:16:55] yeah yeah I know it's for me you know one of my guys Ryan Job was also shot in the head
[03:17:03] and he also ended up losing his vision and unfortunately after that you know after one of the
[03:17:11] surgeries one of the many surgeries that he went through there was some there was some medical
[03:17:15] complications and he passed away but it's it's for me you know meeting you seeing you talking to
[03:17:25] you you know you had this you have the same kind of attitude that he had you know he he had been
[03:17:31] blind and he was doing all kinds of things he was climbing Mount Ranier he was he had shot a bull elk
[03:17:39] you know he was doing the kind of stuff that you're doing so it's it's awesome for me to see
[03:17:44] someone in your situation that has the same exact attitude that Ryan Job had just just a
[03:17:49] just a warrior badass that just was still driving on regardless oh I've one of the things
[03:17:54] if we got to another animal that I shot this past year I went to West Virginia and I shot a
[03:18:02] black bear so it was a female bear and I named it Penelope after the fact I got that stuff so that's
[03:18:12] my little Penelope what are the workouts you just do your normal workouts that you used to do for
[03:18:18] bodybuilding in the first place you and I've been doing it for so I might very first bodybuilding
[03:18:24] show was in 1993 I did the Central States of Michigan after college I was still looking to some
[03:18:29] big pet it I've always been a big guy and I'm pretty knowledgeable about nutrition and the
[03:18:34] workouts and stuff but I'm also smart enough to know there's always somebody who knows more than you
[03:18:40] so maybe I'm blind I can't see how I look I'm kind of feeling I'm getting leaner and this and that
[03:18:45] so I do have a coach so my coach I check in at least right now in the offseason every week
[03:18:55] send them pictures or videos how I'm looking and answering questions you know how is my appetite
[03:19:02] how am I feeling this way in that way you know getting blood work all the time to make sure
[03:19:08] everything is functional often the course I spent a shit ton of money on supplements and the
[03:19:14] coach kind of guy sees my okay you know we all you know you need to do maybe some work
[03:19:19] fat burning cardio you know we'll range your diet this way and also he sends me workouts too to follow
[03:19:28] you know depending on the time of year you know depending on the workout and the rep range and
[03:19:33] the amount of cardio I'm doing so it's important too you have to have a good coach you can trust
[03:19:40] too that's good but a lot of these coaches on front blow smoke up their client spots oh you look
[03:19:45] great you're going to be Mr. Olympia and this and that and it can't even win a local show you know
[03:19:50] it's like you know I've rather have somebody be honest with me you know hey Joe you know you
[03:19:55] looks like you're ready for this competition or you're not and please tell me how make the
[03:20:00] corrections I need to make or maybe we're going to have to wait on you know and do a later competition
[03:20:05] so you know we'll see what the future holds you know if I get some more sight back I would like to do
[03:20:14] you know some tactical training with people maybe some firearms training get more sight back I could be
[03:20:22] a coach for people getting ready for competitions but I couldn't just find now if I can't see
[03:20:26] all they look I can't really do a effective job you know so keep moving forward with those things
[03:20:32] and of any other opportunities pop up you know you know be willing to do those things and you know
[03:20:41] on 52 years old now you can't let these young guys beat you she got to keep yourself in shape
[03:20:47] you know it was working you know work overseas you know with the special ops guys and like how old are
[03:20:52] you 41 is it okay grandpa so I got a grandpa for you you know
[03:20:58] well hey that's awesome probably you're probably a good place to wrap up so if if people want to
[03:21:08] you know contact you for your speaking I know you're you're at joe p dot u s that's right right
[03:21:16] for your for your website yes I got a website it's got all my things speaking on there how to
[03:21:21] get a hold to me and I've spoken to all different kind of groups teams different kind of I've spoke
[03:21:26] to you know corporations I spoke to people at quickins alone so whoever wants to hear me run my mouth
[03:21:32] all talk to you awesome awesome echo you got any questions well yeah rewind a little bit
[03:21:38] back to Afghanistan uh heroin poppies and who's growing that and why how the the teller man
[03:21:46] makes the farmers grow it and the teller band is growing that because that's their money source
[03:21:53] income okay so who do they sell that to a lot of that heroin goes to Europe we get some of it
[03:22:01] over here on the United States but the great majority of it goes to the European consumers okay
[03:22:06] got it so you just like you know in Colombia and stuff like that Afghanistan is yet just another hub for
[03:22:12] another media yes and you know it's some you know a real big country that consumes out heroin is
[03:22:18] actually Russia too they have a pretty bad heroin problem there but you know it's a big money and
[03:22:23] that's you know what funds they're in search and seeing the problem is now that we're gone out of
[03:22:28] Afghanistan and how it's crazy there again they're just growing uncontrolled and like I said when we were
[03:22:36] hitting them hard we didn't eradicated but you can see it was having an effect but now it's just you
[03:22:44] know bonds I it's open now okay that must be as you look at like drugs you you spent so much time
[03:22:53] in the DA when you hear people talk about legalizing drugs what's your what's your thoughts on that
[03:23:00] and this is this my thoughts only um I have talked to numerous numerous drug addicts
[03:23:06] and the common drug that they start with is marijuana and in my opinion without a doubt
[03:23:17] it's a gateway drug and the marijuana that's out there now it's not the same marijuana they're
[03:23:23] even was 5 or 7 years ago it's so strong you know and it could lead the other things and you know
[03:23:29] we could you have a whole debate on that and every state that it's legalized um the auto
[03:23:36] accidents has really increased you know it's still illegal federally you know and and for some medical
[03:23:43] conditions you know I can see that it could be useful for but in my opinion a lot of people who use it
[03:23:51] say under the vise of medical it's just to get high you know and that's this that's this my opinion
[03:23:59] well Joe you got any closing thoughts
[03:24:01] just um everybody out there to soliciting you know like I said there's a wilderness away
[03:24:08] if you want to get something done you can get it done and just you know have that have that mindset
[03:24:14] and just keep going and if things get bad or down tomorrow's a new day make it through that day
[03:24:19] wake up the next day and give that next day hell awesome man thanks for joining us
[03:24:26] appreciate you coming on here appreciate you sharing these lessons that you've learned and and most
[03:24:32] important thank you for thank you for your incredible service and your incredible sacrifice
[03:24:37] for our nation and thanks for what you're doing today going around talking to people being here
[03:24:43] just continuing to inspire people to overcome whatever whatever adversity that they're facing
[03:24:51] it's incredible example that you set for all of us so thank you for being here and thanks for everything
[03:24:56] you do you quite welcome as my honor and privilege with that Joe pure sante has left the building
[03:25:04] echo which is it that oh so I'm used to and you mentioned this before too where
[03:25:13] very used at this point very used to you know military guys coming up their mindset their
[03:25:20] experiences stuff like that it was interesting even though it wasn't a huge deviation I don't think
[03:25:26] but it was like enough of a deviation to seem like a big change to go law enforcement you know
[03:25:34] and it particularly particularly I didn't grow up around drugs at all like I don't think I've
[03:25:40] ever even you haven't been to 500 math house no chef cook what math labs labs
[03:25:45] what yeah what he call it cook lab say labs or clan clan destiny clan destiny lab
[03:25:55] unit or something yeah oh no the answers no I have not I've never seen math before I've never
[03:26:03] seen I've seen cook before I've never seen her and before I've seen weed before weed is only one
[03:26:10] mm-hmm I'm it's I've seen a crack head with an empty crack pipe I don't think I've ever seen
[03:26:18] real crack before check well well definitely you could probably tell I was exploring the
[03:26:26] the police side of things and especially you know the the investigations side of things and
[03:26:31] I set up because that's let's face it that's all stuff that I'm not super familiar with and it's
[03:26:37] very interesting because it's all about human nature you know informants and dealers and police
[03:26:43] it's you know that's why they make all those movies about that kind of stuff because there's drama there
[03:26:47] right there's humans interacting you know in really stressful life changing environments
[03:26:53] yeah and so yeah definitely was interesting and and that's her you know he's he had a really
[03:26:59] I mean he's had a very interesting life to say the least yeah I mean you could probably write a book
[03:27:05] about that one big bus or the other big bus or the one big you know you could write a book about
[03:27:11] any of those things yeah and it would be very interesting and fascinating and you'd learn a lot
[03:27:16] so he's done that over and over and over again and then went to Afghanistan and then had a
[03:27:22] had a hit on his head in Honduras right I started thinking you know being in like being an iraq
[03:27:30] when you're out on patrol you think someone might try and kill you you think they
[03:27:33] all try to kill like you or someone near you it's not you at least I never felt that way
[03:27:42] I never felt like you know the bullets that say I always make this joke hey you know bullet say
[03:27:48] they don't you have a bullet with your name on it you have the bullet that says to whom it may
[03:27:51] concern yeah he had bullets plural with his name on it I don't really like that feeling
[03:27:58] I mean you want to talk about you think I'm paranoid right now which I am I'm paranoid about
[03:28:02] stuff right now if that was going on yeah I would be in of levels 12 alert mode no one to be
[03:28:11] getting near me it'd be pretty crazy to see I think yeah there's something very specifically
[03:28:19] sinister about a plan to kill you to kill you specifically right right yeah I don't think no I
[03:28:26] yeah no one's ever specifically said we're gonna kill Jocco other than Dean Lister made that one
[03:28:34] uh CD yeah he did kill Jocco CD but it was just a CD that was just music he wasn't actually
[03:28:40] trying to kill so it was somewhat of a conspiracy I will give him that the the Lawn
[03:28:46] Firstman part of it too which so a lot of times when you start to talk about iraq afghanistan
[03:28:52] and I understand what it does seem like okay that's a create that's a different time
[03:28:56] in a faraway place but now he's over here talking about everything Dean Lister like all this
[03:29:01] stuff and you're like man all this stuff right now is going on right now like probably pretty close
[03:29:06] to here oh well so and currently going on right now this moment yes like you know this moment
[03:29:11] there's an informant that's sitting buy in some drugs from somebody there's a bust about the
[03:29:15] happened right now something that I've literally no exposure to so to me that is like oh that's kind
[03:29:21] of crazy I did want to ask about lifting yeah but we would have been here for a while
[03:29:26] time I'd been along I thought you would at least want to compare by set workouts with them
[03:29:31] you know my man is getting his lift on well for sure which actually and I was gonna ask
[03:29:36] him to but he said he's age 52 right now and if you can look like that at 52 I mean I don't
[03:29:43] know if he's getting ready for a show or something like that but if you can look like that at
[03:29:48] 52 that's like it not only is it eye opening but like I'm letting you you know what let's just go
[03:29:54] and restate that if you can look like that at 20 or 32 or 42 it's true yeah I'd be less surprised
[03:30:02] but it does kind of set this a little bit better of a calibrated standard you know kind of gives
[03:30:07] like those of us who want to maintain muscle mass will say yeah kind of gives you some hope on now
[03:30:13] and you know he's not weak either oh for sure yeah and he didn't go into much but but I
[03:30:19] I you know read some stuff about him and some bios and stuff but he won all kinds of like
[03:30:24] you know awards for football and he's just a great athlete and just Jack and Steel so for sure
[03:30:31] for those of us that want to maintain muscle mass have you ever met someone that didn't I guess
[03:30:36] occasionally you get maybe a wrestler like a fighter or someone that's literally going down a
[03:30:42] weight class below there what they can cut you know sometimes people say oh I'm resting at 172
[03:30:50] I'm gonna go down to 162 and I'm already shredded so I'm going to lose muscle mass right
[03:30:58] occasionally that might happen I think when people get into some if they get into some
[03:31:03] endurance sports maybe like triathlon or something they might want to do some muscle mass maybe
[03:31:07] yeah and I'm taught wait what are you asking like is there if you ever known something that said oh I'm really looking to
[03:31:12] find it out how I can lose some muscle mass no negative a jett just for first formate
[03:31:18] sake yes that's essentially it but that's a rare case um just life in general they say after age
[03:31:25] whatever 30 or something like that like things like degenerate pretty quick or whatever
[03:31:31] that's weird and then muscle mass is one of those things where if you just lifted like you're
[03:31:36] gonna lose muscle mass as you get older straight up you're just gonna lose it uh my daughter was
[03:31:42] telling me my daughter's in college and she's studying but she was I was up with her and she was
[03:31:47] telling me that she was she's out there jack and steel and working out she got her little friend
[03:31:52] group and they which is cool because they're a little friend group they're all in the working out
[03:31:58] yeah it's good she turned in as she jits but she was telling me because she's studying
[03:32:03] something some kind of canyzeology some kind of physiology I keep reading what they call it now
[03:32:09] when I was younger so she studying nutrition science and what we used to call
[03:32:15] exercise physiology was a minor people would get right they don't call that anymore I
[03:32:20] figure what they call but that's what essentially canyzeology maybe that's what she I think that's
[03:32:25] but that's different than exercise physiology she's studying stuff she's studying stuff
[03:32:29] about working out okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay but she says she was saying
[03:32:34] hey when you if you don't lift you immediately start like losing muscle degenerate yeah and it's not
[03:32:43] it's not like I mean it doesn't matter like the process at the end of the day you're losing
[03:32:48] you're losing your muscle and a lot most of its functionality move it or lose it yeah and then
[03:32:54] resistance training which is lifting is the best one is the thing that induces muscle like growth
[03:33:00] and or maintenance depending on big muscle so yeah it makes sense so basically go lift please
[03:33:07] go work out you know I mean resistance rate that's another thing my daughter was saying
[03:33:12] all your bones yes your bones if you're not putting your bones under pressure yeah now that's
[03:33:19] because you could argue well you know running is good too which it is and you could say swimming
[03:33:23] good too out that's good too but you gotta put weight on your body you gotta put resistance on your
[03:33:28] body to make your bones stronger yeah yeah and that's the the point I think overall that I
[03:33:37] get from that the beginning of what you're essentially saying is all kind of exercise has its
[03:33:43] like major by the way when you compare it to no exercise all exercises have major benefits major
[03:33:50] they're all different though so good so good all right so if you're working out which you are you
[03:33:55] probably need some some fuel for you you get some jockel fuel jockel fuel dot com you can get
[03:34:02] protein you know you could get protein from a lot of places you get it from stake recommended
[03:34:08] chicken recommended sushi if you're not good Charles yes right yeah what percentage of
[03:34:13] protein do you get from sushi like 70% and the other 30% is milk I would literally
[03:34:20] say like literally probably like 50% not recently not but overall you may sushi at your house
[03:34:25] ever no you just have to get a place yeah and you know your place do you know do you know
[03:34:30] do they know your order already do you order the same thing all the time yes for your whole family
[03:34:34] everyone's getting everything like everyone's getting the same you're the case the Charles residents
[03:34:38] we need our food sign goes variable literally like you're I see your face and you're kind of making
[03:34:44] a joke but I mean kind of I'm being serious the answer is yes yeah in fact I call the place
[03:34:51] because there's a place literally walking distance from me they got to take out color ID yep
[03:34:54] I'll say they say I haven't seen it yet no it's not in the office right
[03:34:59] I'm getting cut raw yeah yeah I'll call they'll be like hi I'll go how are you that's it that's
[03:35:04] how they answer the phone yeah then I'll be like I want this I gotta say my order and she already
[03:35:07] knows boom boom boom boom yes full of how much is the cost oh it depends so some days they're
[03:35:13] closed or they closed late so if they closed it like 930 and there's another place that closed
[03:35:18] that midnight so I'll get it delivered it that made it down's way more and that was like 100 bucks
[03:35:24] per just for me okay yeah I'm about at the we're in the whole family no how about just you
[03:35:31] at the regular spot oh like 60 so okay that's a good deal given given like what I get they have
[03:35:38] good prices over there cocky sushi yeah well you probably gonna need some milk to watch that down
[03:35:43] yes sir to get this sweetness because sushi's not sweet right is it no sir it is not sweet
[03:35:49] and he gets the mochi ice cream afterwards I don't like mochi ice cream I don't like the taste like
[03:35:55] um tastes like uncooked no bread around oh what what they call that what do they call
[03:36:00] the taste like uncooked bread wrapped around a piece of ice cream who made that up right
[03:36:05] we made that up right what makes it funny is how accurate you can are it is right in a way like
[03:36:13] if you look at a certain way because it is essentially like a dough that's like dough okay
[03:36:18] uncooked but it's like the rice dough like it's it's mochi that's why you know what mochi is
[03:36:22] have you ever had mochi just mochi you know that wrapping that you're talking about it's just that
[03:36:28] but it tastes good bread and how are you can get it oh man it's the best but my family was like
[03:36:33] somehow amped about mochi and so they got me amped they got me hyped this size of a year's ago
[03:36:38] they all you know we get this dessert like we had to go somewhere to get it right so we get in the car
[03:36:43] we go we're gonna get mochi I get mine I'm like I'm the mine's cook because it does taste good
[03:36:51] right it's like dough what you said is dough is it mochi ice cream yeah there's yeah
[03:36:55] then there's there's ice cream in the middle of it but you happen to be said dough what was the
[03:36:59] point yeah that should do that why would do that you are right because it's not that sweet either
[03:37:04] so you're like oh I feel like my like no it's not so anyway all right so if you're not into mochi ice cream
[03:37:10] and you what cuz mochi ice cream is just ice cream really so that's not healthy mocha on the other hand
[03:37:14] no the way we're protein mochi mochi mochi doesn't matter like dough does taste like dry flour
[03:37:20] dough is it odd that I'm like there's a tiny tiny part of me that's kind of insulted that
[03:37:26] you don't like mochi or mochi ice cream it's like I'm like talking you never have that feeling
[03:37:31] where it's like one time okay so I'm a picky eater right I'm a picky eater I don't like a
[03:37:37] bunch of different foods I was out with my wife one time this is what she was my wife she was just
[03:37:42] a girl that I had met but I was kind of into her like a lot right but hey so I'm a your current wife
[03:37:48] correct wife yes I don't wife back then but we were going out and she wanted me to try something
[03:37:54] something I knew I didn't like I think it was yogurt but not yogurt you know I'm an American
[03:38:00] I'm an American that grew up in the 80s so so yogurt to me was a freaking dan in yogurt you
[03:38:07] know filled with sugar and blueberries like sauce on the bottom like that's the same
[03:38:13] those things are good cuz they're filled with sugar so but this was we were we were overseas
[03:38:18] and I had already made the mistake of thinking that yogurt overseas equated to a dan in
[03:38:25] sugar filled yogurt that I ate when I was 12 years old and eight nine of them because they
[03:38:30] tasted good but I realized that what other people ate yogurt it was just as weird tasting
[03:38:35] whatever with weird cucumbers and then or something not so anyways my wife who wasn't my wife
[03:38:42] yeah she's oh she's from England so she's all nice or whatever oh try this and I go oh no it's okay
[03:38:48] I don't really like that she goes now just try she's she had the same attitude that you're
[03:38:52] implying right now like she was kind of mad yeah as if you know as if you're saying oh I
[03:38:58] you don't like air but what do you mean you don't like air of course you like air she's like
[03:39:01] oh no no just try it's just it's yogurt it's good I go now I don't like this you know
[03:39:06] you know just try it and she started escalating kind of it and poached it's okay you know I take a
[03:39:12] little spoonful it's freaking disgusting I knew it was I mean it was you know so so so mochi
[03:39:20] whatever ice cream is in that bad yeah I can stomach it but I'm not gonna make an effort to eat it
[03:39:27] now moke I will make effort to eat moke is you you get that hey I will do what it takes to get some
[03:39:34] moke up in here you know I last night had a moke shake double with a ham it wasn't ham is turkey sandwich
[03:39:42] boom that's a full that's a that's a pleasurable scenario yeah you know I know it was the basic moke
[03:39:48] shake by the way what's basic just the milk it was lactose free milk okay because I had it for
[03:39:54] some other stuff as me and just regular moke that's it no no banana no nothing but you got that
[03:40:00] little Sammy on and then you put down that moke that's a quality scenario right there you go oh yeah
[03:40:07] yeah and it was like no matter if I was into the extra protein at the time and it was but even if I
[03:40:12] wasn't it's like kind of like a cool little shock like a good job of fuel calm I could get the
[03:40:20] drinks at wallaw you can get all the development shop appreciated go to origin us a dot com we got some
[03:40:26] cool stuff for sale there boots jeans t-shirts most important duties you use I train some I train some

[03:40:45] jujitsu and the people are awesome everyone's cool it's just freaking legit great class
[03:40:50] but bunch of awesome people there so and you know you get I you know it's interesting a lot of
[03:40:58] origin geese out there lot of origin geese out there people want to buy origin geese because they know
[03:41:04] that they're made in America I saw I don't know what you call it a mini doc it it was video
[03:41:12] about like American manufacturing or it was about manufacturing and they were just it was talking
[03:41:17] about what kind of the history of it or whatever and the reasons that you know whether be China or
[03:41:22] all the foot like it's kind of like they they kind of have to do the manufacturing for all these
[03:41:27] different reasons and it depends on the product and all this stuff right but they kind of have to do it
[03:41:32] otherwise it's kind of like that was kind of the storyline but then there were there a few exceptions
[03:41:38] in there that they didn't go specific on but they were just like trying to doing this this because of
[03:41:44] this and to do it anywhere else it's like it's it's just unrealistic you know kind of a thing
[03:41:49] but then all the exceptions when I kind of like deduced all the exceptions I was like oh wait that's
[03:41:54] why origin can do all this stuff they do have to make certain sacrifices but with the sacrifices comes
[03:42:00] like more basically the detriments that that places like China or whatever they call them what are they
[03:42:04] called affordable labor affordable labor it's freaking slave labor bro yeah um it's kind of like
[03:42:12] that for example but here you get basically each laborer or whatever they have like actual quality
[03:42:20] of life oh that reflects on the end product kind of a thing so anyway you can kind of go
[03:42:26] down the line and be like oh I see but here's the thing at the end of the my point is it's like what
[03:42:30] they do is like dang that's kind of not kind of that's like that's a very unique thing that they're
[03:42:36] doing who's they or origin USA us we are unique thing that we are doing so yeah go to origin

[03:48:40] and that's some pretty good advice not just for law enforcement but for life
