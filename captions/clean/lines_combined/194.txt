00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.56 This is jocoponcast number 194 with echo Charles and me jocobwillic good evening
00:00:06.56 --> 00:00:08.56 here. Good evening
00:00:10.56 --> 00:00:12.56 As a leader
00:00:13.56 --> 00:00:16.06 You have to put others before yourself
00:00:18.36 --> 00:00:22.88 And that starts at the beginning and it starts with everything that you do
00:00:22.88 --> 00:00:30.24 You have to let the men eat first. You have to make sure that they have the gear that they need
00:00:31.52 --> 00:00:34.48 You have to let them get rest before you do
00:00:36.52 --> 00:00:38.52 That's how it works
00:00:40.72 --> 00:00:47.26 You have to make sure that they have what they need to accomplish the mission and then on top of that
00:00:47.26 --> 00:00:56.26 You have to make sure that the mission aligns with the good of the troops
00:00:59.38 --> 00:01:07.42 This is hard for some people to understand but this applies to any organization the military a business a sports team
00:01:10.06 --> 00:01:11.58 And
00:01:11.58 --> 00:01:17.42 You have to make sure that the troops understand that there may be short term sacrifice
00:01:20.94 --> 00:01:25.10 There may even be the ultimate sacrifice in
00:01:27.10 --> 00:01:29.10 War
00:01:30.78 --> 00:01:33.90 Men may be killed for the cause
00:01:33.90 --> 00:01:39.74 But that cause must be just
00:01:41.58 --> 00:01:53.50 And that cause must even in death benefit those who may have to give that last full measure and that that may sound impossible actually
00:01:54.42 --> 00:01:58.38 Because how can anyone benefit from their own death and the answer?
00:01:58.38 --> 00:02:06.14 Is actually quite simple when military personnel risk their lives they do so to provide
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:10.18 Safety and security for their country
00:02:12.78 --> 00:02:16.26 The country where their families live
00:02:17.34 --> 00:02:21.58 And those individuals put their families above themselves and as a military leader
00:02:21.58 --> 00:02:31.38 If you do see that a mission does not ultimately lead to the safety and security of the families of the people that you do lead then it's your obligation
00:02:32.26 --> 00:02:35.18 To raise this up the chain of command and fix it
00:02:38.62 --> 00:02:42.02 Then the same thing holds true in business as a leader
00:02:42.34 --> 00:02:46.22 You must put the good of the troops above yourself
00:02:46.22 --> 00:02:52.06 Now the thing that might seem impossible here
00:02:53.34 --> 00:02:59.82 Is that the overarching measurement of the success of a business is to be profitable
00:03:02.62 --> 00:03:03.62 And
00:03:03.62 --> 00:03:08.70 To maximize profit one of the things that you do is you cut costs and
00:03:09.50 --> 00:03:10.70 One of the
00:03:10.70 --> 00:03:15.78 easiest places to cut costs in any business is people you
00:03:20.10 --> 00:03:23.90 Minimize what you're paying people or you get rid of people and then
00:03:25.02 --> 00:03:27.02 You maximize profit
00:03:28.10 --> 00:03:38.34 So how can this leadership principle work how can you take care of people while at the same time maximizing profitability and the answer is that you have to look at the long game
00:03:38.34 --> 00:03:50.34 You have to see that the stronger you build a business the more long-term stability you build and the more long-term stability build the more stability you build for your employees
00:03:54.10 --> 00:04:00.42 And when you're stable that allows you to grow and when you grow your business the employees have the opportunity for growth
00:04:02.10 --> 00:04:04.10 And those opportunities
00:04:04.10 --> 00:04:11.14 Improve the lives for everyone for the employees for their family and thereby the whole community
00:04:12.10 --> 00:04:14.10 That's what happens
00:04:17.14 --> 00:04:20.66 But then what happens when leaders that don't put their people first
00:04:23.94 --> 00:04:25.94 In the military
00:04:26.26 --> 00:04:28.26 it can result in
00:04:28.26 --> 00:04:34.10 Operations going wrong it can result in senseless strategies and
00:04:35.22 --> 00:04:39.50 In the military it can result in wasted lives and
00:04:43.14 --> 00:04:45.14 In business you can see
00:04:45.94 --> 00:04:52.26 Another kind of destruction in business. It can mean loss of growth for sure the can mean loss of revenue yes
00:04:52.26 --> 00:04:54.26 It can mean loss of jobs
00:04:54.26 --> 00:04:57.22 But eventually it can mean the collapsing of
00:04:59.30 --> 00:05:01.30 Communities the collapsing of
00:05:02.18 --> 00:05:04.18 cultures
00:05:06.34 --> 00:05:11.38 Now of course a balance has to be found and profitability must be maintained
00:05:14.98 --> 00:05:19.06 But the dollar must not trump the people and
00:05:19.06 --> 00:05:22.50 It certainly must not
00:05:23.94 --> 00:05:25.94 Regardless of your
00:05:26.34 --> 00:05:28.34 Capitalistic goals
00:05:28.90 --> 00:05:34.50 The dollar must not trump the communities that built the businesses in the first place
00:05:37.06 --> 00:05:42.74 The pursuit of money must not jeopardize the very fabric of the country
00:05:42.74 --> 00:05:49.38 That gives us the promise for the unhindered pursuit of that money in the first place
00:05:54.18 --> 00:05:56.02 And yet we've seen that take place
00:05:57.62 --> 00:06:00.50 We've seen that take place in our own country
00:06:02.50 --> 00:06:06.50 In cities and in towns and in states where
00:06:07.78 --> 00:06:09.78 Saving a dollar
00:06:09.78 --> 00:06:12.98 Man closing a mill and
00:06:13.94 --> 00:06:15.94 Man shutting down a factory
00:06:17.78 --> 00:06:22.34 In places where making more money in the next financial quarter
00:06:23.38 --> 00:06:26.98 Caused leadership to forget the long-term impact
00:06:28.98 --> 00:06:34.10 And sell the future of those people for cash in hand in the immediate
00:06:34.10 --> 00:06:36.10 And
00:06:39.54 --> 00:06:41.54 That
00:06:41.54 --> 00:06:45.70 Disease that plague of greed can spread
00:06:49.78 --> 00:06:51.78 And it has hurt
00:06:51.78 --> 00:06:55.30 various parts of America at various times
00:06:57.54 --> 00:07:02.50 And when that's happening while the people at the top might build themselves
00:07:02.50 --> 00:07:05.22 A fortune it's a fortune built
00:07:06.50 --> 00:07:10.58 On despair and it's a fortune built on destruction and in the end
00:07:13.46 --> 00:07:15.46 That will come back to hunt them
00:07:17.78 --> 00:07:21.30 Because it is not the right thing to do
00:07:24.34 --> 00:07:26.34 Then it does not have to be that way
00:07:26.34 --> 00:07:28.34 Because
00:07:29.54 --> 00:07:42.26 Because there are leaders who recognize the long-term positive impact of growth and the long-term positive impact of putting your people first
00:07:48.10 --> 00:07:50.10 Putting your community first
00:07:50.10 --> 00:07:56.18 Putting your country first
00:08:00.50 --> 00:08:02.50 And one of those leaders
00:08:04.42 --> 00:08:08.74 Happens to be a business partner of mine happens to be a friend of mine
00:08:09.86 --> 00:08:16.50 And his name is Pete Roberts the founder of or gin us a and once again
00:08:16.50 --> 00:08:23.46 We are in the woods in the foothills of mains western mountains

00:08:39.62 --> 00:08:41.62 Because once again, we have Pete
00:08:42.26 --> 00:08:44.74 Roberts on the podcast Pete
00:08:44.74 --> 00:08:50.02 Welcome back. Thanks for having me. That was powerful. I was just you know you get into that rhythm
00:08:50.02 --> 00:08:54.34 And I'm just my head's good. I just catch myself going up and down like shit the way you captured
00:08:55.06 --> 00:08:57.06 What you just said is I
00:08:57.46 --> 00:08:59.94 Try to say the same thing. I say it differently, but
00:09:00.50 --> 00:09:02.50 Man, the impact
00:09:02.98 --> 00:09:05.46 You know and how important community is
00:09:05.46 --> 00:09:10.02 I know how important it was to new England towns, but it's not just new England towns. It's
00:09:10.98 --> 00:09:12.02 All towns
00:09:12.02 --> 00:09:14.02 all people and
00:09:14.02 --> 00:09:16.66 Man, you're absolutely right. Well with the
00:09:17.54 --> 00:09:20.02 With the standard that we're holding it or the
00:09:21.14 --> 00:09:23.38 The standard is made in America, right?
00:09:24.26 --> 00:09:30.34 We see every single day every single day a corner that could be cut we could make a compromise
00:09:30.82 --> 00:09:36.02 And you know what the profit margins would increase. Yep the profit margins would increase a little bit
00:09:36.98 --> 00:09:38.98 And and every day
00:09:38.98 --> 00:09:45.54 You and I get to see that and you're in it you know you're here you get to see it you know five times a day
00:09:45.70 --> 00:09:51.06 Eight times a day you see a decision that could be made you know what hey we could just get this thing instead
00:09:52.18 --> 00:09:56.58 And the profit margins go up a little bit and every day you hold the line
00:09:57.30 --> 00:10:02.50 Yeah, and I think if you you know like this statement I like to make is well if you if you follow the truck
00:10:02.50 --> 00:10:07.06 Back to the source you're gonna end up in a cotton field in the Tennessee Delta region
00:10:07.06 --> 00:10:13.70 So if you that that's your standard the supply chain is between here and there like like you said like oh yeah
00:10:13.70 --> 00:10:19.70 We could it like building the boots or the jeans a little buttons little brass buttons the leather tags all these things
00:10:20.34 --> 00:10:22.74 If you follow that supply chain back
00:10:23.14 --> 00:10:29.62 You're touching not just your local community but the thousands and thousands of hands and all the communities in between
00:10:30.10 --> 00:10:33.86 That supply chain and I think that's the easiest place
00:10:33.86 --> 00:10:41.14 That you could get rid of some of that but it's also the most important if it if you're truly doing something more than
00:10:42.02 --> 00:10:46.98 Trying to try to earn your weight at the top right and I think that
00:10:48.18 --> 00:10:54.82 In the past you know we thought we've discussed this you know in depth and the past you know and you look at all the free trade agreements on that stuff whatever
00:10:54.82 --> 00:10:56.82 Whatever, you know a side you're on on that thing
00:10:56.82 --> 00:11:02.10 It was greed it was greed and
00:11:05.30 --> 00:11:07.30 The people do the work
00:11:07.70 --> 00:11:12.66 You know yeah, there's mines at the top, you know and there's mines crunching numbers and designing stuff
00:11:12.66 --> 00:11:14.18 But the people do the work
00:11:15.22 --> 00:11:20.74 You know in the beautiful thing that we're doing is we're we're resurrecting
00:11:22.02 --> 00:11:24.66 That heritage and I'll tell you what
00:11:24.66 --> 00:11:27.70 I mean we've been together now one three years
00:11:27.86 --> 00:11:29.86 I think it's been about three years and
00:11:30.34 --> 00:11:33.86 Going from I don't know what we started out like what 10 people
00:11:34.58 --> 00:11:41.22 I think it was eight people when I when when I came when we merged it was eight people so maybe last year
00:11:41.22 --> 00:11:43.22 We had 25 people
00:11:43.86 --> 00:11:47.38 There's 50 people now in the factory 50 people
00:11:48.26 --> 00:11:52.50 Yeah, you know the and I was telling kind of the crew this the other day when we gave the tour
00:11:52.50 --> 00:11:57.78 You know, I'm sitting here saying this stuff right and and I'm talking about being greedy and
00:11:58.90 --> 00:12:01.22 Immediately if you go okay, well this guy's not greedy
00:12:02.50 --> 00:12:09.62 There's like a there's like a point where you say okay, well, what does he believe it and I actually in my mind I was thinking that because here I am talking about hey you can't be greedy
00:12:10.02 --> 00:12:12.02 And then I said listen I am
00:12:12.34 --> 00:12:14.34 I am an absolute
00:12:14.34 --> 00:12:17.38 Hard core capitalist and I
00:12:17.78 --> 00:12:18.58 Love
00:12:18.58 --> 00:12:21.30 Deal-make I mean you you get to see me now because we do business
00:12:21.30 --> 00:12:24.02 You know, I mean I love making deals. I love making things happen
00:12:24.74 --> 00:12:26.66 I love making money like it's great
00:12:26.90 --> 00:12:32.10 It's it's it's a it's a it's a great contest. It's a great way to keep score. You know, it's it's fun
00:12:32.66 --> 00:12:35.86 Right and I'm absolutely a capitalist but
00:12:36.50 --> 00:12:39.54 There's such an easy line to draw so I don't even think it's that hard to draw
00:12:39.54 --> 00:12:43.46 It's not like it's the wood's hard decision to make and oh, I don't know what I should do it's like no
00:12:44.18 --> 00:12:48.82 You you make money, but you do the right thing and you make sure that you're taking care of people
00:12:48.82 --> 00:12:54.66 You're making the right decisions and that's what you do and this is the the cool thing about it
00:12:54.66 --> 00:12:57.14 And this is where people make them a sake is in the long run
00:12:57.70 --> 00:13:01.46 In the long run you'll do better. It's just like leadership just like leadership
00:13:01.94 --> 00:13:03.54 If you're taking care of your people
00:13:03.70 --> 00:13:09.70 In the long run they're gonna take care of you and that's gonna be the long-term victory is gonna be better
00:13:10.10 --> 00:13:15.22 Then looking for the short term. Hey, I bark it if you work for me and I bark at you and you go and do it right now
00:13:15.22 --> 00:13:16.50 Because you don't want to get in trouble
00:13:16.50 --> 00:13:19.70 But you're looking for another job even though I got you to do what I want you to do
00:13:19.86 --> 00:13:25.94 It doesn't matter long-term. I'm gonna lose and when I'm taking investment away from the people that actually support the community
00:13:26.34 --> 00:13:31.54 Where we are then that's just a bad decision in the long run and again short term it looks might look great
00:13:32.10 --> 00:13:36.74 Yeah long-term. What does it look like? It's a bad deal. It's a bad deal for the community
00:13:36.74 --> 00:13:42.02 Which makes the bad deal for the country and if the if our countries have it hard time? Well guess what what if we got?
00:13:42.02 --> 00:13:47.38 100% you've got abandoned mills and factories falling apart in these towns
00:13:48.02 --> 00:13:54.02 100% so you just talked about growth. What do what have you seen from a leadership perspective?
00:13:54.50 --> 00:13:57.78 You've doubled inside and in size and
00:13:58.90 --> 00:14:04.18 I know I said to you the other day as it hey Pete it's gonna get to a point where you're not gonna be able to really
00:14:05.22 --> 00:14:10.42 You know when you got 20 people we got eight people clearly you you I mean personal relationship
00:14:10.42 --> 00:14:16.66 You want families are eight people right exactly when you got 25 people well now we're talking cousins and uncles and aunts
00:14:16.66 --> 00:14:21.94 Maybe you don't know all of them that well and there's probably that one weird you know couple you've recruited all you can
00:14:21.94 --> 00:14:25.30 Yeah, yeah like you're there and now when you get to 50 people
00:14:25.86 --> 00:14:30.50 Well there's people that you know you're you're just you're just not sure and and you don't seem every day because you're busy
00:14:30.50 --> 00:14:34.98 They're busy they're working you're working so you start to you start to rely on
00:14:35.94 --> 00:14:38.58 You're trying to rely up more on your
00:14:38.58 --> 00:14:43.78 Leadership team to carry the message through the company. How's that been for you?
00:14:45.38 --> 00:14:48.98 Honestly, I'll tell you and I don't want it. This just sound like
00:14:49.86 --> 00:14:54.74 You know, oh this is this is the the only thing you should go by but
00:14:55.70 --> 00:14:57.70 When we did it when we like
00:14:58.58 --> 00:15:03.78 When I pushed extreme ownership I had a stack of books and all my leadership and anybody else interested
00:15:03.78 --> 00:15:10.26 I didn't just hold it to the leadership about anyone interested in being part of this company longterm
00:15:11.62 --> 00:15:17.30 I want you to read this book. I'd recommend you read this book and I had people say well I I don't read
00:15:17.70 --> 00:15:23.14 And I'd like cool. I'll pay for I'll pay for yeah, I'll give you cash download it and
00:15:23.78 --> 00:15:29.38 You know and it's like well I don't have time. Oh, we'll put the headphones on while you're sewing you know download it
00:15:29.38 --> 00:15:31.38 You know and I got I got you so
00:15:31.38 --> 00:15:33.38 That
00:15:33.62 --> 00:15:35.62 changed a lot
00:15:36.42 --> 00:15:41.14 A change it changed me a lot and we've talked about this in the past but the biggest thing is
00:15:41.70 --> 00:15:46.10 How important for me decentralized command was the decentralized command
00:15:47.78 --> 00:15:54.18 And decentralized command and the biggest part of that was I was telling you this the other day like
00:15:54.58 --> 00:16:00.74 70 100 what do I mean well you've got allow people and empower people and your leaders to make
00:16:00.74 --> 00:16:06.58 Decisions right and if you can get them to a 70% decision which I learned at the monster also
00:16:06.74 --> 00:16:08.74 You know and I took if you can get them there
00:16:08.90 --> 00:16:16.18 Man, that's that's a great thing. It's a great example. We're sitting here in this pro shop at the immersion camp to get everything here
00:16:16.42 --> 00:16:18.42 It took it took
00:16:18.42 --> 00:16:27.62 5 or 6 trucks and I'm talking a 26 foot you haul an 18 foot trailer another 24 foot trailer and it took a team of 20 people to get everything here
00:16:27.62 --> 00:16:30.82 Yeah, and I took my wife Amanda to the
00:16:31.70 --> 00:16:35.46 The monster and DC and my father on La Jo and
00:16:36.42 --> 00:16:41.38 Brian our business partner came and his wife Megan and and we went through it and
00:16:42.18 --> 00:16:43.78 When you discussed this
00:16:43.78 --> 00:16:48.02 Does it always have to be a hundred percent like I feel like I'm gonna make a hundred percent decision
00:16:48.02 --> 00:16:53.94 Maybe that's a little bit of ego talking, you know, but I feel like my decision is always gonna be a hundred percent right
00:16:53.94 --> 00:17:00.74 Yeah, and I thought that it was too too dangerous to allow anything less
00:17:01.30 --> 00:17:03.30 So what I used to do is I used to
00:17:04.50 --> 00:17:06.50 Flank people to buy into my idea
00:17:07.14 --> 00:17:10.98 You know to me like a flank of the buy into my idea until they until they could see it
00:17:10.98 --> 00:17:14.18 But I had to get them to see it to buy in and now
00:17:15.22 --> 00:17:19.86 It's it's different and it's like setting up this pro shop. I know we were it was early in the morning
00:17:19.86 --> 00:17:25.14 And we just like man your teams your teams going early right and I was like yeah, they were up at five getting everything set up
00:17:26.02 --> 00:17:30.42 And I was like, but I'm not there right now. I'm I'm hanging back. There's a few things I got to do here
00:17:31.14 --> 00:17:37.30 To prep and a man is handling it my wife is handling it and I'm like it's the 70 hundred and you're like
00:17:37.70 --> 00:17:40.02 What do you mean I'm like you know the 70 percent hundred you're like
00:17:40.42 --> 00:17:42.42 Shack
00:17:42.90 --> 00:17:49.30 She she called me to hours later. We're good to go. Yeah, I was like I don't think I could have gotten that done in two hours
00:17:49.30 --> 00:17:55.46 My hundred percent. I don't think I would have gotten it done in two hours. It maybe would have been another 70 percent
00:17:55.46 --> 00:18:02.42 Maybe it would have been 65 maybe it would have been maybe it would have been 80 maybe it would have been an 82 the bottom line any of that discussion
00:18:02.66 --> 00:18:03.86 argument
00:18:03.86 --> 00:18:06.90 You know planning would have just wasted
00:18:07.22 --> 00:18:11.14 Valuable time on both ends. Yep, and but we did do that
00:18:11.70 --> 00:18:15.06 We did because I it was the night before I was like
00:18:15.06 --> 00:18:23.38 But can you see logistically that coming into this camp in the woods you can't get four trucks in
00:18:23.94 --> 00:18:28.58 I'm like you got to be able to see that you need to it this needs to happen methodically
00:18:28.82 --> 00:18:32.74 You know, so as this one's unloading and leaving the next one's coming in
00:18:33.30 --> 00:18:38.18 So you're saying you did waste time discussing I did I did and then you let it go and then I said go
00:18:39.06 --> 00:18:41.94 Yeah, I said I think you've got a good plan. I think that's gonna work
00:18:41.94 --> 00:18:45.38 Let me know what you need and I got behind supporting the plan
00:18:46.98 --> 00:18:51.78 That's the way that's yeah, so there's a great example of decentralized current and so that's now what you've had to do
00:18:52.50 --> 00:18:57.06 with everything and because you can't manage it all because
00:18:57.70 --> 00:19:01.46 This is you know we work with that. I saw in front we work with all different companies
00:19:01.46 --> 00:19:06.90 But obviously work with startup companies and we see this kind of growth and these are the kind of things that trip them up
00:19:06.90 --> 00:19:12.82 They get the guy who's a visionary like you're the big visionary and then you start saying well
00:19:12.82 --> 00:19:16.10 I can you know I started this thing when I started this thing I was making every decision and now
00:19:16.10 --> 00:19:19.86 I was suddenly look up and if you were trying to make every single decision that was going on the factory
00:19:20.02 --> 00:19:22.34 It would be a total disaster oh
00:19:22.90 --> 00:19:24.90 1000 percent
00:19:26.02 --> 00:19:29.94 What what has necessitated the
00:19:29.94 --> 00:19:36.42 The doubling and size this year and it's not just a doubling in people because when you get people what else you need you need space
00:19:36.66 --> 00:19:39.86 Yeah, so we got two more buildings. Yeah
00:19:40.26 --> 00:19:46.18 Man the new the origin labs facility at the warehouse now. This is super challenged dude
00:19:46.74 --> 00:19:52.58 We I don't know if you know remember on the Instagram. I don't know if you saw that echo like all the sudden it was flooded
00:19:53.14 --> 00:19:56.26 You know and we had this spray foam because you know this isn't a
00:19:56.26 --> 00:20:00.74 Extreme environment right extreme hot and extreme cold during the winter
00:20:01.22 --> 00:20:06.90 But we're trying to get everything into the warehouse. It's not insulated. We got to get a heating system in and
00:20:07.54 --> 00:20:12.18 You know it's just one of those things where you just grind and grind and grind but we mean to go
00:20:12.18 --> 00:20:17.70 Shaded a great deal on that property and the next property is gonna allow us to expand a little more
00:20:18.82 --> 00:20:20.82 You know and I think
00:20:20.82 --> 00:20:22.82 I think that
00:20:22.82 --> 00:20:26.98 I think we're gonna have some challenges ahead of us because we've
00:20:27.86 --> 00:20:34.34 Expanded the three locations, but we've almost created a bermuted triangle of sorts the way that we
00:20:35.38 --> 00:20:38.90 Secured the locations the facilities it's efficient
00:20:38.98 --> 00:20:42.66 It's like lean manufacturing of you know in between the factories
00:20:42.98 --> 00:20:46.98 You know the way you can get from you know one point to the next to maximize
00:20:47.62 --> 00:20:49.62 Maximizer time, but
00:20:49.62 --> 00:20:53.94 You know the lab's facility is awesome and why we fulfill them
00:20:54.82 --> 00:21:03.86 500 to 1000 packages a day out of there for filling yeah all leaned out from a shipping perspective yeah and in the next facility which
00:21:05.38 --> 00:21:07.78 We'll be moving into what next week
00:21:09.54 --> 00:21:12.66 Next week you want to hang out and move some of those machines for those where's our girl
00:21:12.66 --> 00:21:14.66 Our favorite fat ass
00:21:14.66 --> 00:21:20.18 Where all the the shoe manufacturing machinery will be going and the screen printing and some raw
00:21:20.18 --> 00:21:22.18 Robert materials so
00:21:22.42 --> 00:21:28.42 22,000 square feet there 17,000 square feet and labs and of course we're chewed up 21,000 square feet currently so
00:21:28.98 --> 00:21:33.14 Growing quickly and yeah leadership has been essential
00:21:33.70 --> 00:21:41.54 And decentralized command essential in that growth and impossible without it and seeing your and I noticed this from early
00:21:41.54 --> 00:21:45.62 You know I'd come up and someone to pull me aside and say hey you know in chapter four
00:21:45.62 --> 00:21:50.74 You're talking about this you know and they'd ask me questions yeah and I'd just be it was such a
00:21:51.38 --> 00:21:52.90 Great sign
00:21:52.90 --> 00:21:55.30 Because when people don't recognize
00:21:55.54 --> 00:21:58.18 How important their job is and how important they are as a leader
00:21:59.06 --> 00:22:01.22 That's not that's just this is not gonna work
00:22:01.22 --> 00:22:08.74 But when someone realizes that they're having a huge impact with every part of their department and that their leadership is the most important thing in that department
00:22:08.74 --> 00:22:12.66 When they realize that and they start taking ownership of it
00:22:13.54 --> 00:22:20.26 That has an impact and that's what it was good for and I saw that early on I saw that early on you know we did like a little
00:22:20.90 --> 00:22:22.90 Little session and
00:22:23.06 --> 00:22:25.38 But and people were asking me questions during the session
00:22:25.78 --> 00:22:30.10 But afterwards you know people coming up hey I want to want to ask this in front of everyone
00:22:30.10 --> 00:22:35.94 But what do you think about this how should I handle that and so the people are aware and that's I think that's one of the things that
00:22:35.94 --> 00:22:42.18 Has I'm not saying there's not growing pains because I mean of course there's growing pains but most of the growing pains are are like
00:22:43.54 --> 00:22:49.62 Almost like physical growing pains sure you know like when you're when you're sun grows four inches in six months and he's
00:22:49.62 --> 00:22:56.10 Says you know hey my knees kind of hurt. Yeah, that's just a physical. Yes. It's gonna hurt. You're growing sorry dude
00:22:56.66 --> 00:23:05.14 But as far as you know the psychological trauma of all the you know brain damage about this and that the other thing is very limited right now
00:23:05.14 --> 00:23:13.38 Which is amazing to see yeah, it is and you we're talking about people who weren't leaders prior to
00:23:14.18 --> 00:23:19.38 Origin you know nobody had a leadership position nobody had a management position
00:23:20.02 --> 00:23:23.06 You know and the the leaders that we've built
00:23:24.18 --> 00:23:26.58 There they're not entitled to it
00:23:26.98 --> 00:23:33.70 You know it's it's weird because you you got people who go through let's say they go to college to be you know business management or leadership
00:23:33.70 --> 00:23:35.70 Whatever
00:23:35.62 --> 00:23:40.26 There's so much potential and people who just want to work and be part of something
00:23:40.34 --> 00:23:45.30 There's so they find so much motivation in that I would rather have someone and
00:23:45.54 --> 00:23:48.58 When I do like job interviews I say hey like one of the first questions
00:23:48.58 --> 00:23:54.74 Are you looking for a job or are you looking for a career and that's kind of a loaded question right when I hear I'm looking for a career
00:23:55.94 --> 00:24:02.98 Okay, we're gonna dig deeper into this conversation now. I'd rather take someone who's looking for a career
00:24:02.98 --> 00:24:04.98 that
00:24:04.98 --> 00:24:09.94 Has no leadership skills and give them the opportunity because I know long-term
00:24:10.42 --> 00:24:15.70 They're gonna be an incredible asset the other company. That's the same theory that we have with EF overwatch
00:24:15.70 --> 00:24:21.54 With with hiring vets were bringing vets in look a veteran might not have worked in whatever industry you're in
00:24:21.62 --> 00:24:26.10 But that person is hungry they got leadership skills and they got discipline
00:24:26.50 --> 00:24:31.78 They end especially the group that we got we got they they study and trained in extreme ownership and the principles
00:24:31.78 --> 00:24:33.78 So they they know how to lead and
00:24:34.74 --> 00:24:39.22 We're getting the feedback that we're getting is phenomenal because people hire somebody and they go
00:24:39.54 --> 00:24:43.38 What they you know they feel like they're taking a little bit of a risk because the person it's you know
00:24:43.38 --> 00:24:46.18 It's this person that was in the in the army for
00:24:46.66 --> 00:24:54.34 21 years or this person who's been in the whatever industry the the the gas oil industry for 21 years and you think well
00:24:54.98 --> 00:25:00.10 We should probably just hire the guy that kind of has experience and we're finding over and over and over again
00:25:00.10 --> 00:25:04.26 They guess what you take that person that's really hungry that has good leadership skills
00:25:04.58 --> 00:25:11.30 They step into that role they learn the this industry specific stuff and they and they rock and roll and I tell
00:25:11.62 --> 00:25:18.42 I tell kids this all the time not not kids, but you know college kids college graduates college graduates
00:25:18.42 --> 00:25:22.26 If you're that person that will work hard
00:25:23.14 --> 00:25:26.90 You can there's so many companies because I work with so many companies
00:25:26.90 --> 00:25:33.14 They there's a drought of people no ones like hey, yep, we got all the good. I've never I have never
00:25:33.54 --> 00:25:37.22 Been to a company where they said yep, we got all the good people we need we don't need anyone else
00:25:37.22 --> 00:25:41.78 We don't need anyone other good people. I've never heard anyone say anything close to that ever
00:25:42.34 --> 00:25:47.54 Even companies where you know people are banging on the door to get in big tech companies that have
00:25:47.78 --> 00:25:50.26 That have popcorn machines in the hallways
00:25:50.26 --> 00:25:52.98 Open button. I want to work there, right?
00:25:52.98 --> 00:26:00.18 There's people banging on the door to get there. You know those big tech companies say they say how do you think we could get better people?
00:26:00.18 --> 00:26:02.18 That are willing to go hard
00:26:02.82 --> 00:26:07.38 So it's exactly what you're saying if you if you look for someone if you look for somebody
00:26:07.38 --> 00:26:10.50 That has that hunger and has that desire and then they actually have to have it
00:26:11.06 --> 00:26:14.74 Because believe me there's people like an interview great and say who you love to grind?
00:26:14.82 --> 00:26:18.82 What's your biggest weakness my biggest weakness is sometimes I work too hard, right?
00:26:18.82 --> 00:26:23.78 That person and then you show up and they're they're in the freaking Twinkie stash
00:26:24.34 --> 00:26:27.62 So I'm not talking about people yeah, I sometimes I get in the Twinkies that
00:26:28.98 --> 00:26:32.58 I saw you getting in the donut stash today bro. Are you okay?
00:26:33.38 --> 00:26:35.38 I'm there and I'm good now
00:26:35.38 --> 00:26:39.54 You had like insulin spike your face was kind of sagging
00:26:39.54 --> 00:26:41.06 Swagging away
00:26:41.06 --> 00:26:46.58 I was like I'm gonna go lay down. Yeah, I mean I can't literally never eat a donut again
00:26:46.58 --> 00:26:52.42 If I do I always think there's gonna be someone with a with an iPhone over there in the corner and that's gonna be the viral
00:26:52.42 --> 00:26:55.86 The only viral video of jockel won't be something that echo made
00:26:57.22 --> 00:26:59.22 You need me the donut
00:26:59.86 --> 00:27:02.82 Maybe my video eating a donut that would be a
00:27:03.38 --> 00:27:12.02 That would be a major kind of situation that we'd have to discuss yes like trees in us. Yeah, yeah, that would be I've I haven't been betrayed very much
00:27:12.74 --> 00:27:14.74 In fact, I've only been betrayed one time
00:27:14.74 --> 00:27:17.62 But if that I would consider that
00:27:18.18 --> 00:27:22.10 We'd have to we'd have to put that in that mean number that would be a consideration of the trail
00:27:22.10 --> 00:27:25.30 Yeah, I don't think I would do but don't worry. Don't forget where I'm out of you. No, that's
00:27:25.78 --> 00:27:27.78 The duet of a bottle of all the other things. Yes
00:27:28.34 --> 00:27:34.34 How many pieces two pieces? That's good start. How many did you feed me? Oh, dude. I would just kept shoveling your busy
00:27:34.66 --> 00:27:38.26 I don't think you even know you're thinking what is what is like the sweet
00:27:38.74 --> 00:27:42.42 Like part they're the the moist like they're really like almost wet part
00:27:42.42 --> 00:27:46.26 That's like the the honey okay sugar syrup
00:27:46.98 --> 00:27:50.90 But you know that's a special recipe. Yeah, you know we were we when we were
00:27:51.46 --> 00:27:56.50 We went to Harry's Dine we were in New York City and Harry's steak house. We're eating with Harry in there
00:27:57.78 --> 00:27:59.78 We sent him buckle of a
00:27:59.78 --> 00:28:04.66 In my mom she she called me and she's like you sent buckle of a
00:28:05.22 --> 00:28:09.70 To New York City to a guy who wants a big restaurant. Oh, yeah, she goes you didn't send the recipe did you
00:28:09.70 --> 00:28:14.90 And I was like no no, I just sent a buckle like she was upset
00:28:14.90 --> 00:28:21.30 Yeah, I had like sent him the recipe to make the buckle of it is it is legit a secret recipe and there's one thing
00:28:22.10 --> 00:28:26.34 That she does to make it as good and I'll I'll tell you what it is after the podcast
00:28:26.74 --> 00:28:28.74 Yeah, it's no one else does it
00:28:29.14 --> 00:28:30.66 It's an old Spartan
00:28:30.66 --> 00:28:36.58 That's yeah, there you go. That's Pete's mom's special recipe. Okay, so there's got to be demand there's got to be
00:28:36.58 --> 00:28:41.86 Something driving this growth obviously, you know, and it's been a it's been a
00:28:42.82 --> 00:28:44.82 continual kind of
00:28:45.78 --> 00:28:48.98 Rapid and I'm rapid continual product
00:28:50.02 --> 00:28:54.50 Invention for lack of a better work yeah, and one of the things and you and I were talking this morning
00:28:55.86 --> 00:28:59.86 I was holding I was putting on a I was getting another rift ghee
00:29:01.38 --> 00:29:04.42 And I know not everyone does you do too, but
00:29:04.42 --> 00:29:07.70 The rift ghee is like
00:29:08.98 --> 00:29:15.46 It's like a complete it's it's like a new product. It's like it doesn't exist until now and it's weird to say that about
00:29:15.46 --> 00:29:20.02 I guess it'd be I don't know what's a good what's a clothing product that like completely
00:29:21.30 --> 00:29:27.70 Change like it didn't exist and now it does I would say that's easy that that would be the compression shirt under
00:29:27.70 --> 00:29:30.26 I'm okay, I'm out with because we both like college football
00:29:30.26 --> 00:29:35.94 Remember we had the grades the cotton the culture it's in the cotton shorts and you wore that cotton T-shirt underneath
00:29:35.94 --> 00:29:41.46 Football pads and then under our my came out with the the football shirt and it changed it changed again
00:29:41.46 --> 00:29:46.10 Now you would you're not gonna play with this old thing anymore never wear anything else again
00:29:46.10 --> 00:29:50.58 Right, and that's what the rift is like you're not you're not gonna what you're not gonna go. Oh
00:29:51.06 --> 00:29:55.22 Cool, I'm just gonna wear another ghee today because I have it notes. No. I just I'm just gonna wear this ghee
00:29:55.94 --> 00:29:57.54 the
00:29:57.54 --> 00:29:59.38 the the whole thing is
00:29:59.38 --> 00:30:01.38 engineered
00:30:01.06 --> 00:30:08.42 brand new yeah, right you I did you it was the football jersey thing like was that an inspiration for coming up with a rift?
00:30:08.98 --> 00:30:15.06 I absolutely the because the performance like we developed this poly synth fiber
00:30:15.78 --> 00:30:17.78 What I like to say is you know we
00:30:18.58 --> 00:30:21.86 We didn't just manufacture it we synthesized this
00:30:21.86 --> 00:30:23.86 I don't know I mean like
00:30:23.86 --> 00:30:30.90 It synthesized and we you know I don't I don't know if I told you how much money we spent on developing this
00:30:30.90 --> 00:30:32.90 You might have kept that for me
00:30:33.94 --> 00:30:38.18 I probably just did take Kelly, but you know we we had the I think I told you we had the order
00:30:38.18 --> 00:30:43.30 It's a batch of yarn we had and you've got to set up the friggin loom and there's 3,000 ends
00:30:43.86 --> 00:30:49.38 Right and it and it takes 60 hours to set it up and and we had to have the yarn spun and then we did it and we're like
00:30:50.42 --> 00:30:52.42 It's not good enough
00:30:52.42 --> 00:30:54.42 so you have all these
00:30:54.82 --> 00:30:58.74 prototypes, you know we've got to get rid of now we've got to get the yarn again
00:30:58.74 --> 00:31:02.18 They were like it's not twisted strong enough. It's pilling too much
00:31:02.50 --> 00:31:05.78 We need to talk the ends and you're talking these little freaking fibers
00:31:06.50 --> 00:31:09.14 individual fibers, you know and well
00:31:09.46 --> 00:31:13.14 It's not abrasion resistance enough and so you know
00:31:13.54 --> 00:31:20.26 When you take away the garment itself and the cut and the spiral wrap and how it function on your body and you go right back to the fiber
00:31:20.26 --> 00:31:27.78 That's where we had the start, you know we had the start from that point and then develop the weave the dragon weave jen three
00:31:28.58 --> 00:31:35.94 And it's hard to explain unless you put it on of course you were down there again like king Arthur like the riff to be old
00:31:37.78 --> 00:31:39.78 And you put it on you know and you're like
00:31:39.78 --> 00:31:41.38 Brown bro
00:31:41.38 --> 00:31:46.10 This thing is just ridiculous and that was by the way fresh out of the package
00:31:46.10 --> 00:31:52.26 When you take any piece of clothing fresh out of the package it well in my opinion it all sucks coming out of the package
00:31:52.58 --> 00:31:59.70 When you take it out of the package, you know this doesn't this thing is out of the package. It's brand new and you put it on and it feels like
00:32:00.66 --> 00:32:03.14 It feels like it's been you've skinned a unicorn. Yeah
00:32:04.90 --> 00:32:08.18 Something like that so so that's like an example of
00:32:09.38 --> 00:32:10.42 product
00:32:10.42 --> 00:32:11.78 moving forward
00:32:11.78 --> 00:32:13.78 making things and
00:32:13.78 --> 00:32:20.02 and this is the the other kind of thing that is happening because of our sport
00:32:20.66 --> 00:32:26.34 Stuff has to be extremely durable, right? So you're making something that just doesn't feel good because you can make something that feels good
00:32:26.66 --> 00:32:28.66 That has to be durable
00:32:28.66 --> 00:32:33.94 And that's the tricky part right because if you look at the way they make things soft or
00:32:35.46 --> 00:32:38.26 To feel good against the skin usually what that means is there
00:32:38.26 --> 00:32:46.02 Detair you're rating the textile a little bit right they're breaking it down so that those fibers touch your skin and they feel
00:32:46.02 --> 00:32:48.02 I'll smooth and comfortable and
00:32:48.42 --> 00:32:54.66 We couldn't deteriorate the strength of the garment so we had to find a way to do that with the yarn
00:32:55.22 --> 00:33:01.06 Right, that's the keys find a way to make the yarn comfortable and then the weave and then make the garment
00:33:01.38 --> 00:33:07.86 Former and body in the way I explain is like if you took a if you took a baseball or a crossball and you took this piece of paper and
00:33:07.86 --> 00:33:11.46 You're wrapped it around see if you can get it smooth. Can you get a smooth?
00:33:11.70 --> 00:33:16.98 No, you're gonna have wrinkles all through it, right and and that's what basically every gear on the planet is like
00:33:17.86 --> 00:33:24.10 All right now if you take that same piece of paper and you just strip it into straight strips and then you start wrapping those strips around that ball
00:33:24.10 --> 00:33:26.10 What you're gonna get you're gonna get a smooth surface
00:33:26.50 --> 00:33:31.22 That's why we call the spiral wrap because it strips that spiral around your body
00:33:31.54 --> 00:33:33.94 You know and seven seven panels and
00:33:33.94 --> 00:33:40.58 Yeah, it's innovative. I don't know if there's another it shouldn't exist the garment shouldn't exist. Yeah
00:33:41.14 --> 00:33:47.70 So coming off of that and while you're working on that and I'm all this is coming home from a trip
00:33:47.86 --> 00:33:52.98 And when I was up here and seeing the factory and being you know just kind of in that
00:33:53.62 --> 00:33:55.62 Spiritual high
00:33:56.34 --> 00:34:00.18 From seeing our people American people working hard
00:34:00.18 --> 00:34:06.98 Like dedicated like passionate about doing a good like just seeing everything in action and I was flying home
00:34:06.98 --> 00:34:08.98 And I remember I was laid over somewhere
00:34:09.78 --> 00:34:16.74 And I'm sitting in the airport and I'm just looking at everyone while I'm sitting there and I see that
00:34:17.30 --> 00:34:20.42 And I called you and I said hey Pete man
00:34:21.06 --> 00:34:27.38 And you said yeah, and I said how many people do you know that you that do you jiu jitsu and you're like
00:34:27.38 --> 00:34:32.90 Um, I don't know a hundred and I was like cool
00:34:33.62 --> 00:34:41.14 How many people do you know that wear jeans and you said everyone and I said I'm in the airport right now
00:34:41.86 --> 00:34:46.10 And eight out of ten people are wearing jeans. I remember that conversation
00:34:46.74 --> 00:34:51.94 We need to make jeans and you go I've always wanted to make jeans
00:34:51.94 --> 00:34:57.46 You said I've always wanted to make jeans and
00:34:58.66 --> 00:35:02.74 That was the opening of a whole new
00:35:03.46 --> 00:35:07.54 Game right a whole new market and a whole new world
00:35:08.42 --> 00:35:13.70 From that conversation what was the next step from there?
00:35:14.74 --> 00:35:17.22 You know when we had that conversation
00:35:18.34 --> 00:35:20.58 And I don't know you might have told me this fact
00:35:20.58 --> 00:35:26.10 In America there's 300 million Americans you know how many Americans actually own jeans
00:35:27.06 --> 00:35:31.06 298 million
00:35:31.06 --> 00:35:33.06 298 million
00:35:34.10 --> 00:35:38.90 People own jeans and there's two million communists that don't know jeans
00:35:42.26 --> 00:35:44.26 You know it was uh
00:35:44.26 --> 00:35:48.26 I knew we could make the product you know and honestly like
00:35:48.26 --> 00:35:53.14 I always wanted like I couldn't have fit for a nice jeans as a kid
00:35:53.46 --> 00:35:59.46 You know I remember going into like the banana republic or the gab and basically looking at stuff and trying it on and
00:36:00.42 --> 00:36:04.42 You know four kids my mom you know 24 thousand dollars a year with four kids
00:36:04.66 --> 00:36:13.06 She just didn't have a lot of extra and we would get like one nice thing before the school year started and of course school starts for our kids my daughter started school today
00:36:13.70 --> 00:36:15.70 You know and I think about what she has
00:36:15.70 --> 00:36:22.82 And what you know the hard what hard work has has allowed us to do for the kids to start school with new
00:36:22.82 --> 00:36:29.14 Personacres and some clothes and I think about like jeans have always been important to me because we couldn't afford them
00:36:29.86 --> 00:36:31.62 And it was it was always the
00:36:32.58 --> 00:36:37.70 It wasn't just the style of it but it made you feel alive it made they made you feel free
00:36:38.26 --> 00:36:42.26 You know and they've always represented that I mean in digging into
00:36:42.26 --> 00:36:53.78 Denham in around the globe not just America if you start connecting denim you see they represent like freedom revolution independence empowerment right they represent these things and
00:36:55.14 --> 00:36:58.42 I was so damn excited you were on board with it
00:36:58.90 --> 00:37:02.42 I just like yes, I think it was just like yep
00:37:02.42 --> 00:37:05.86 You just need it a little you were like Frankenstein just need a little spark
00:37:05.86 --> 00:37:12.18 Yeah, you know when you come safe well, you know as exactly exactly just turn it on because
00:37:12.98 --> 00:37:19.86 You know managing you know all these people managing you know the factory a couple of occasions and the growth right
00:37:20.74 --> 00:37:22.74 Of course you don't want to make mistakes
00:37:23.30 --> 00:37:27.46 You still got to be a little bit naive enough to think you can you can do it though and
00:37:28.18 --> 00:37:32.66 I knew we could do it because we've been making this stuff for combat sports
00:37:32.66 --> 00:37:39.46 We've been making products that people are yanking on ripping at pulling wrapping around arms and heads with
00:37:40.50 --> 00:37:44.18 And I knew we had to set up to make durable goods and
00:37:45.78 --> 00:37:51.30 Denham was to me it was like well if we make this it will be the most
00:37:52.02 --> 00:37:57.14 Durable jeans ever made because we're gonna apply the same techniques and concepts
00:37:57.14 --> 00:38:04.66 We've developed for the past six years manufacturing stuff for combat sports and we're gonna apply the same thing to this
00:38:06.02 --> 00:38:11.38 And that's what we did and we just did it man. I mean, I don't even know how to explain
00:38:11.38 --> 00:38:17.06 I go I mean we got leaves our pattern maker and we just started having a work and I overnight
00:38:17.06 --> 00:38:20.82 You samples send it back where you know in the first ones weren't amazing
00:38:21.46 --> 00:38:23.46 They were but honestly like
00:38:23.46 --> 00:38:28.66 Got the textile right you know American cotton little bit of stretch
00:38:28.66 --> 00:38:34.02 You know modern but still super durable and then we started sewing it together with those
00:38:34.58 --> 00:38:39.14 Three needle like chain stitch machines. No, which you just don't find anymore. No, you know
00:38:39.14 --> 00:38:44.42 You just don't you don't find it it's hard because if you go with two needles then you cut your cost of thread by
00:38:44.42 --> 00:38:49.14 E-sir and done if you go if you go into the store and look at what they actually have
00:38:49.54 --> 00:38:52.90 It's usually just one thread. Yeah the scene. You know it's just one one machine
00:38:52.90 --> 00:38:57.06 So and it's easy to cut costs like that and it's just like well, that's just not what we're doing so
00:38:58.02 --> 00:39:05.38 It was challenging you know, I think it's not just developing the product because you can and this is across the board when you're
00:39:05.38 --> 00:39:07.38 Starting something new
00:39:07.38 --> 00:39:13.14 Even though we've been making all these geese and and stuff for jiu-jitsu
00:39:14.02 --> 00:39:17.54 It's still a different product and they're still style
00:39:17.54 --> 00:39:23.14 You still have to have some type of style and you know call that form right well
00:39:24.02 --> 00:39:30.42 There's there's like jeans out there and it's all all all all form right and then you've got stuff that's just simply
00:39:30.42 --> 00:39:37.54 Function right and the idea is you've got a balance those two things out you can't be too over the top
00:39:38.02 --> 00:39:42.50 To extreme it's just like balancing out leadership. I mean, it's it's really the same thing
00:39:42.58 --> 00:39:44.90 Formant form function the balance of those two things
00:39:44.90 --> 00:39:50.26 You know and we didn't get it right right off. You know and you're like you're like bro this
00:39:50.74 --> 00:39:53.54 Yo here in the back, you know the riser in the back
00:39:54.42 --> 00:39:59.86 Just just not doing it for me. Yeah, it's weird too for me because I never paid attention to it before right? You noticed that
00:39:59.86 --> 00:40:06.42 Oh, yeah, no too much as soon as I got it I was looking at other jeans that I had and saying okay here's what's different
00:40:06.42 --> 00:40:11.06 I remember saying I'd be on like sending new pictures or here's I didn't even know what a yoke was
00:40:11.06 --> 00:40:17.86 But I realized it's like the part below the waistband where it gives you a little separation between the legs of the pants
00:40:18.34 --> 00:40:21.46 And I didn't never paid attention to before my life
00:40:21.46 --> 00:40:26.18 But I looked at it was like hey, this seems like it's a lot longer than mine right now
00:40:26.18 --> 00:40:30.98 Is there a benefit to that and you're like well here's the benefit and I said well here's the negative
00:40:30.98 --> 00:40:37.38 The negative is I got a pack I got a a pocket on my hamstring right now instead of on my ass cheek
00:40:37.38 --> 00:40:42.26 Which is where it needs to be form a form in function right so then it's like okay, we can tighten that up so
00:40:42.82 --> 00:40:47.38 The the other thing that's weird about it that know that I definitely don't think about
00:40:48.42 --> 00:40:55.14 Is when you make it and you say okay, this is what we are going to produce and you pull the trigger on that
00:40:55.62 --> 00:41:01.14 Like that's what you're gonna get so it better be good. It's kind of like I do relate in the fact that when you publish a book
00:41:01.54 --> 00:41:05.22 And you're gonna print 100,000 copies and
00:41:05.22 --> 00:41:08.58 Then you open it up and you find a mistake
00:41:09.14 --> 00:41:14.42 That's that stinks and that's that stinks and that's what happened
00:41:15.38 --> 00:41:18.98 You know the fur those right behind you right there. Yeah
00:41:20.10 --> 00:41:22.10 We went into production and
00:41:23.82 --> 00:41:29.06 They're coming off a line right we trained everybody and I thought we were good to go
00:41:29.70 --> 00:41:34.10 Initially, but they started coming off a line and we weren't used to working with you
00:41:34.10 --> 00:41:38.42 We're used to working with like compression textile because for all the rash guards and stuff we make
00:41:38.90 --> 00:41:41.54 But not a woven we're used to working with nits
00:41:41.94 --> 00:41:46.82 We've we've never worked with a woven so all of our machines were set up for rigid
00:41:47.22 --> 00:41:49.22 Right textiles that don't stretch and
00:41:49.70 --> 00:41:54.26 Like the first like few hundred pairs that came off we started to look at them
00:41:55.30 --> 00:41:57.30 more intently and
00:41:57.86 --> 00:41:59.86 We found that
00:41:59.86 --> 00:42:07.20 We made some mistakes and the mistake was somehow it was the the fabric was starting to grow oh
00:42:07.48 --> 00:42:09.48 grow it was growing
00:42:09.94 --> 00:42:11.30 because
00:42:11.30 --> 00:42:16.74 And this is something machines will never be able to do yeah, all right machines aren't people
00:42:16.74 --> 00:42:24.90 They can't they can't make adjustments on the fly you can only program a machine to do a task and it can do that one task well
00:42:25.30 --> 00:42:29.22 But they can't recognize when there's something wrong and then making adjustment
00:42:29.22 --> 00:42:32.18 Right it's gonna do one thing one speed one way
00:42:32.66 --> 00:42:40.90 That's a beautiful thing about humans right and in manufacturing to do it right if they want to do it right and that's a that's a key thing right there
00:42:40.90 --> 00:42:43.94 They've got to want to do it right because they could just keep rolling even though
00:42:43.94 --> 00:42:48.66 There's a problem and just keep cranking and this happens a lot this happens
00:42:48.66 --> 00:42:50.66 So you say it was growing what does that mean?
00:42:50.82 --> 00:42:55.94 The the textile the garment was growing because it was either being held
00:42:55.94 --> 00:43:01.86 Too hard or the tension of the machine and what we found is a mixture of both okay
00:43:02.10 --> 00:43:06.14 You know because we're used to making these real you know the stuff for
00:43:06.42 --> 00:43:12.50 Jiu-jitsu so you're holding it and and as as they were holding it that the textile was growing because it was a little bit of
00:43:12.66 --> 00:43:18.40 Likeering it God it was growing the whole thing was growing so that the 32's were coming offline and they like 36's
00:43:19.06 --> 00:43:22.60 So we had to make some adjustments on the fly
00:43:22.60 --> 00:43:28.52 To have to change the patterns recut a batch of denim and we just and you know
00:43:28.52 --> 00:43:30.44 It was the right move we just didn't release it
00:43:30.44 --> 00:43:33.64 We're just like no that's a big tuition payment
00:43:34.04 --> 00:43:36.28 That's just it's just gonna be a tuition payment
00:43:36.68 --> 00:43:42.32 You know and and push forward I mean and some of them had that is that what calls like the twist in the seam
00:43:42.32 --> 00:43:46.84 Yeah, I like to my son has a pair like one of these original ones and
00:43:47.56 --> 00:43:51.24 He's you know I look I look at him. I was like yeah look at the thing. He's I got no care
00:43:51.24 --> 00:43:55.88 Because he's cool. You think I don't care about what I look like my son is just like don't care
00:43:55.88 --> 00:43:57.80 Yeah, then he's like these are the best jeans
00:43:57.80 --> 00:44:01.08 I'm just wearing them anyway, so the seam on the outside of his leg
00:44:01.08 --> 00:44:05.62 We'll switch forward to his chin in the front. Yeah, we found one leg. We found an old
00:44:05.62 --> 00:44:09.24 We got a care an old research paper from like the forties
00:44:11.56 --> 00:44:15.32 Leg twist in jeans was the title of it. No kidding
00:44:15.32 --> 00:44:18.72 And so what what was the cause of that my old pattern maker Lisa
00:44:18.72 --> 00:44:25.16 She's 60364 she found the paper she brought it into the factory and is it as a whole
00:44:25.44 --> 00:44:28.88 Research thing like a college research leg twist in jeans
00:44:29.60 --> 00:44:35.44 What it is is that as the textiles being woven that it's called a twill and there's
00:44:35.44 --> 00:44:38.08 You know diagonal lines if you look at the jeans diagonal lines
00:44:39.44 --> 00:44:41.44 In order to cut jeans
00:44:41.44 --> 00:44:50.40 Effectively to not get leg twist you have to cut them in pairs and those pairs have to be reversed opposite and we found that out after
00:44:50.40 --> 00:44:52.40 Close to a thousand pairs
00:44:54.56 --> 00:44:57.04 Yeah, leg twist in jeans
00:44:57.44 --> 00:45:04.32 So you talk about manufacturing a product as simple as jeans and I mean what did it take us before we launched it?
00:45:04.32 --> 00:45:07.80 I mean we did it fast man like what six months? Yeah, yeah
00:45:07.80 --> 00:45:15.40 We're sending me pairs pretty quick just launched. Yeah, so we finally got a figure it out and we got them launched and
00:45:16.44 --> 00:45:19.08 I don't I you know if for phenomenal
00:45:19.08 --> 00:45:22.68 I don't know what else to say about the product itself, but man those
00:45:23.64 --> 00:45:27.56 Those ladies worked I'm saying ladies because our whole that whole floor is all women
00:45:27.80 --> 00:45:29.000 between the ages of
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.60 20 and
00:45:30.60 --> 00:45:32.60 60 and

00:46:38.36 --> 00:46:45.48 Next thing we're gonna make and and we've got a little tie back to my heritage in the navy in the seal teams
00:46:46.12 --> 00:46:47.48 because
00:46:47.48 --> 00:46:49.48 in the in Vietnam
00:46:49.80 --> 00:46:51.48 the
00:46:51.48 --> 00:47:00.04 Issued fatigues weren't durable enough for the combat operations at the seals were doing and so many of the seals in Vietnam
00:47:00.60 --> 00:47:08.20 War jeans and so we're gonna make some jeans. We've got a cool name form that I will not reveal
00:47:08.20 --> 00:47:10.20 At this time
00:47:10.20 --> 00:47:12.20 I was like I'm waiting
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.60 To pull
00:47:14.60 --> 00:47:16.60 But you know the like I said and then we just
00:47:16.60 --> 00:47:24.84 The last podcast where do you haven't heard yet that then we just did with a seal master chief name Kirby Horelle who is just as
00:47:25.48 --> 00:47:29.08 Completely legit as they come as frog men and
00:47:29.96 --> 00:47:34.92 Yeah, you know, he's talking about wearing jeans and mom and so yeah, so we've got that
00:47:34.92 --> 00:47:39.08 We've got these lightweight jeans coming. I think that's gonna be and I already have actually already have three pairs
00:47:39.08 --> 00:47:41.08 Sorry
00:47:41.08 --> 00:47:44.44 Well, I have a pair. I've been I've been testing the goods
00:47:44.44 --> 00:47:48.52 Hmm myself so I spent 30 days in Europe last month
00:47:48.52 --> 00:47:54.92 I put 200 miles on the boots and I think it was 20,000 miles on the jeans as we traveled
00:47:55.56 --> 00:48:01.64 And man those things are getting worn in fading in and just the abrasion of movement and motion in life
00:48:02.52 --> 00:48:05.16 It's awesome dude. It's freaking awesome. So
00:48:06.04 --> 00:48:08.84 And you know people like why you're so damn excited about jeans
00:48:09.48 --> 00:48:12.52 Well, 298 million Americans own jeans
00:48:12.52 --> 00:48:19.40 Because they're cool, but it's really what they represent you know and I learned something recently that
00:48:20.28 --> 00:48:24.92 You know after the great before the great depression and I can go into an old antique store and you see the
00:48:24.92 --> 00:48:27.40 Trunks and they got the stickers all over on the postcards
00:48:27.80 --> 00:48:32.12 You know well people were traveling to Europe before the great depression
00:48:32.12 --> 00:48:35.72 They were going on vacation for they'd go for like a month or two at a time, right?
00:48:36.20 --> 00:48:38.20 And then the great depression happened and
00:48:38.20 --> 00:48:45.80 And every everybody just kind of hunkered down and they didn't feel confident enough to go on these
00:48:45.80 --> 00:48:48.60 Voyages, right? Ships these voyages
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.44 So what they decided to do is go and explore the American West and
00:48:53.32 --> 00:48:57.48 What I've heard is that the cowboys out there were wearing
00:48:58.52 --> 00:49:00.52 denim blue jeans and
00:49:01.80 --> 00:49:05.96 And the idea and I'm digging into this through research is that
00:49:05.96 --> 00:49:14.12 That's where fashion and jeans started in the US so the city slickers from the east went out west
00:49:14.68 --> 00:49:17.24 saw the free range
00:49:17.80 --> 00:49:23.80 cowboys and said yeah and and took that free spirit attitude
00:49:24.36 --> 00:49:31.40 Back to the east coast and there you go. I still got to prove it, but that's your theory. Yes. Yes
00:49:32.68 --> 00:49:34.68 now
00:49:34.68 --> 00:49:40.52 I remember this. How do you remember do you remember like the Berlin wall do you remember East Berlin as well as I do?
00:49:41.08 --> 00:49:41.48 I
00:49:41.48 --> 00:49:49.32 From my channel. No you know about it. Yeah, yes, I do but I didn't get it. I remember watching the wall come down. It was 89
00:49:50.04 --> 00:49:55.72 I was 10 years old 11 years old maybe and I absolutely remember it. I remember
00:49:55.72 --> 00:50:08.84 I remember honestly feeling unsure because I didn't understand why these men with these sledge hammers
00:50:09.40 --> 00:50:13.96 were slamming that wall with such anger and then elation
00:50:14.76 --> 00:50:21.80 Didn't register and I remember the conversation and the house of my parents talking about freedom and communism
00:50:21.80 --> 00:50:25.88 and I had no idea what these concepts. I didn't know anything about them
00:50:27.48 --> 00:50:36.04 But then when the wall came down and they were accepted into their friends and family watching them come across. I was just like
00:50:36.76 --> 00:50:43.40 They've been separated. I just remember that not knowing what communism wanted was or separation or anything. I just
00:50:43.40 --> 00:50:48.12 remember that they were they were they were imprisoned basically. Yeah and
00:50:48.12 --> 00:50:55.80 Yeah, of course I was there last month so I yeah because what I remember when I was a kid you know at my school like kids would
00:50:56.68 --> 00:50:58.92 go on like a school trip
00:50:59.80 --> 00:51:01.80 to wherever
00:51:01.80 --> 00:51:03.40 England or
00:51:03.40 --> 00:51:06.28 Spain or something like that like the Spanish
00:51:06.76 --> 00:51:09.96 class there'd be kids that would go on a school trip
00:51:11.40 --> 00:51:12.44 and
00:51:12.44 --> 00:51:17.80 what people would say is like you got to bring jeans bring jeans you can sell them. Yes, you can sell them
00:51:17.80 --> 00:51:23.32 and there was like a black market to get those things into the eastern block country. You could sell a pair of
00:51:23.32 --> 00:51:26.36 American you know standard American jeans that cost
00:51:26.76 --> 00:51:33.000 $16 at the grocery store at the department store and you could bring them to sell them for a hundred dollars
00:51:33.64 --> 00:51:34.68 I remember hearing that
00:51:34.68 --> 00:51:40.68 $100 and I had like two pairs of jeans or three pairs of jeans and I'm thinking hey can you take these
00:51:40.68 --> 00:51:44.44 can you try and get a hundred dollars for these things and that was
00:51:44.44 --> 00:51:50.04 and that to me has always said that those people over there identified
00:51:50.76 --> 00:51:55.16 blue jeans like the like you're saying the East Coast you look at the cowboy and said that's the
00:51:55.16 --> 00:52:04.12 spirit of freedom right there and you know the thing is is you know when I get into something
00:52:04.12 --> 00:52:08.28 I go deep that's why we ended up building a factory in my backyard
00:52:08.28 --> 00:52:15.88 but I need to I need to understand more about why jeans represented
00:52:16.60 --> 00:52:22.12 revolution anyways we were in East Berlin last month and working on this project doing
00:52:22.12 --> 00:52:29.64 some research and I sat down with a woman who lived in East Germany
00:52:30.60 --> 00:52:37.48 her dad was a spy and you know they had I and I didn't realize this they had access to the
00:52:37.48 --> 00:52:43.64 West in terms of the news and the media and everything it wasn't like they were closed off from that
00:52:43.64 --> 00:52:49.88 and I think that might be a misconception they could see it but they couldn't touch it right so it's
00:52:49.88 --> 00:52:54.12 almost like like they're they're they're in a cage and they can see what's happening outside
00:52:54.12 --> 00:53:01.32 but they can't they can't touch it and so we sat down and we had dinner in this old Russian restaurant
00:53:01.32 --> 00:53:07.72 and it was it was like this this scene like you'd see it a movie or something you know with
00:53:07.72 --> 00:53:13.16 the yellow lights and all the pictures on the wall and we're sitting there intimate like this
00:53:13.96 --> 00:53:23.48 having dinner and she told me about growing up in the East and as she got into the conversation
00:53:24.12 --> 00:53:30.44 she reached in her dot and her bag and pulled out her diary from her childhood and she's like
00:53:30.44 --> 00:53:36.04 let me show you something and she opened the diary and there was a tag in there a Wrangler tag
00:53:36.04 --> 00:53:42.44 and she said this was my from my first pair of jeans and this tag was beat up and worn in
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:50.60 and and her jeans deteriorated but she saved that tag and then she flipped the page and in a
00:53:50.60 --> 00:53:57.000 diary she was she had a little bit it this one was name was Anya Anna and and her friend had gone
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.92 in New York City and she had written you know in in a girl's diary she had and she has jeans and
00:54:02.92 --> 00:54:06.92 she took the pen and she underlined it and she took a highlighter and she highlighted it
00:54:07.56 --> 00:54:13.40 and she's like I didn't really understand how important it was to me until you and I started talking
00:54:13.40 --> 00:54:22.76 because we had talked the day before and she said the first time in my life I ever feel empowered
00:54:22.76 --> 00:54:29.40 as an individual was when I got my first pair of jeans when I was 13 and I put them on
00:54:29.96 --> 00:54:37.32 the first time I had only worn dresses what they gave us to wear and I put those jeans on for the
00:54:37.32 --> 00:54:42.68 first time and I felt free and if you wanted to still this thing down why it's so important
00:54:43.32 --> 00:54:50.68 look at that you know what I just realized so I have a I have a 10 year old daughter and
00:54:50.68 --> 00:54:58.04 she's been wearing your daughter might be too old for this trend but a lot of girls right now
00:54:58.04 --> 00:55:05.64 that are younger maybe six seven eight nine they were basically a matching kind of whole
00:55:06.20 --> 00:55:13.88 polyester like dry fit type outfit like that's the whole thing right like the and it all matches
00:55:13.88 --> 00:55:19.08 it looks like a weird tie dye looking thing and you know my daughter must have had like three or
00:55:19.08 --> 00:55:22.84 four of them and she would just rotate them like that's just just just what and her and all
00:55:22.84 --> 00:55:27.48 of her friends they look like somebody spilled crayons everywhere and that's what that's the
00:55:27.48 --> 00:55:31.000 all that's kind of like and I think from a mom's perspective you know it's really easy you know
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:39.08 just there you go you know just wear this and my other daughters and my other daughters took her shopping
00:55:40.52 --> 00:55:47.16 and when she came home she says dad I'm gonna go put on some of the clothes I got and she had
00:55:47.16 --> 00:55:51.16 she was she came out and she was wearing a pair of jeans and it was her first pair of jeans
00:55:51.16 --> 00:55:54.76 believe it or not wow because we live in California there's no we don't wear jeans out there
00:55:55.32 --> 00:56:00.20 we were shorts or you're if you're a eight year old girl you wear these outfits these matching
00:56:00.20 --> 00:56:04.76 little what is it nylon is that what it is what is it I don't know this P wear those things
00:56:05.32 --> 00:56:11.08 yes okay yeah like a weight is that a romper yeah romp yeah well it's like that but it's all it's like a
00:56:11.08 --> 00:56:16.92 woo it's just an outfit and every little girl yeah super a lot of it so my daughter comes out of
00:56:16.92 --> 00:56:21.96 her room and you know she's 10 you know and she's tall for a 10 year old but all of a sudden she
00:56:21.96 --> 00:56:26.68 had jeans on it and I could see now that you're I'm connecting you know she looks so
00:56:27.48 --> 00:56:33.000 proud and you know kind of like she was standing on straight like she was now in you know
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.80 in the big leagues kind of and she you know you know that time you go through your life
00:56:37.80 --> 00:56:44.60 for your like I'm a person yes she looked like she had that kind of I'm a person I'm an individual
00:56:44.60 --> 00:56:51.88 I'm a I'm a person I got I'm I'm here confident yes I'm here yeah the I'm not mom is
00:56:51.88 --> 00:56:57.96 little girl anymore now you're here and how much of that comes from my daughter's going you need to
00:56:57.96 --> 00:57:05.16 get jeans you know what I mean you need to get jeans yeah that's in my kids that's in my kids
00:57:06.04 --> 00:57:13.000 psyche that you you know what you get jeans and that's when you become an individual human
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.68 ready to take on the world that's so cool and it's crazy because it really does you know it
00:57:20.68 --> 00:57:28.84 really does like it just you know when you wear something like and that's the that's the important
00:57:28.84 --> 00:57:34.12 I mean it's a it's a beautiful thing really you know to that you can be empowered by something on
00:57:34.12 --> 00:57:39.80 your body you know and and people say well that's that's not it's not important you know what you
00:57:39.80 --> 00:57:44.20 wear well it's really not important what you wear but it is important how you feel about yourself
00:57:44.20 --> 00:57:49.72 you know it is important how you project yourself you know I mean if you if you're working
00:57:49.72 --> 00:57:53.88 for a restaurant front going somewhere you know do you wear a teacher if you go on Fox News what
00:57:53.88 --> 00:57:59.08 do you put on yeah I put on suit why because that's what you put on that's right right
00:58:00.68 --> 00:58:04.68 I think that's important I think the next time I might be going on I might be wearing some orange
00:58:04.68 --> 00:58:09.88 jeans boy this is what I this is something else I just realized think about this okay
00:58:10.84 --> 00:58:16.36 do you have a you get a pair of slacks right get a pair of slacks what's another word for that pants
00:58:16.36 --> 00:58:22.52 trousers trousers or whatever you get a pair of pants those if you just get a normal pair of pants
00:58:22.52 --> 00:58:29.08 whatever they they'll change a little bit over time but basically the change that they go through
00:58:29.08 --> 00:58:35.80 deteriorates them and they're no longer usable but jeans are different jeans wear and they become
00:58:36.36 --> 00:58:41.80 comfortable and they come to your body they like they like they wear them or not yes they wear
00:58:41.80 --> 00:58:46.92 S they wear in not out but they become yours like you can't if one if you have a nice pair of jeans
00:58:46.92 --> 00:58:51.24 that's broken and they've had for a while and something happens to them you have to go get another
00:58:51.24 --> 00:58:56.28 pair and you have to go through a period of time where you they're not quite your jeans yet and you know
00:58:56.28 --> 00:59:07.80 what's crazy is is that woman on you I was I was with she told me she's like you know
00:59:08.36 --> 00:59:15.32 they they tried to make jeans because eventually you didn't have to smuggle them in any more eventually
00:59:16.04 --> 00:59:22.60 you if you knew somebody outside they could ship you the jeans if they could afford them right
00:59:22.60 --> 00:59:30.68 so they became so popular that East Berlin government decided East Germany government decided
00:59:30.68 --> 00:59:40.04 we're gonna make jeans and they did they made jeans and I picked up a pair of those jeans I
00:59:40.04 --> 00:59:46.76 found someone who had a pair and they weren't jeans they didn't know how to weave the text out
00:59:46.76 --> 00:59:51.24 and they couldn't figure it out so what one of they were they just like some weird fabric like
00:59:51.24 --> 00:59:57.08 it was a weird fabric and it wasn't even in the go died so they would never they wouldn't even
00:59:57.08 --> 01:00:06.60 fade in they would just like blue material yeah it was it was crazy so it failed miserably and she
01:00:06.60 --> 01:00:15.32 said so the the government imported a million pairs of American jeans and they sold out like
01:00:15.32 --> 01:00:20.92 the like the day they arrived that's the kind of thing where you realize that's why communism doesn't
01:00:20.92 --> 01:00:26.52 work yeah because the state can't figure it out you know but individuals can't so give them some
01:00:26.52 --> 01:00:34.76 jeans and let them run wild now okay jeans we got that we might have gone a little bit
01:00:34.76 --> 01:00:39.16 I don't know we little ripped but hey all right now the other thing you said is you put
01:00:39.16 --> 01:00:46.12 miles on boots yeah now this is a little bit of a reversal role where I said you like hey bro
01:00:47.16 --> 01:00:55.88 everyone wears jeans you said to me hey man we need to make boots and that made me that made me
01:00:55.88 --> 01:01:03.24 nervous because I look at boots I said hey man like these are everyone's feet are different
01:01:03.24 --> 01:01:09.000 it's hard to make and it's you got the sizes I mean they're you can't hand them a pair of boots like
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.88 boots are what size they are and and and people's complain about blisters and you know in a
01:01:15.88 --> 01:01:21.96 seal platoon everybody wants a different kind of boots so I was definitely more hesitant on the
01:01:22.52 --> 01:01:28.84 on the just the product itself and then on the manufacturing to me it just seemed like crazy thing
01:01:28.84 --> 01:01:32.92 and you you're laughing I don't know if you remember this you were laughing you were like you were
01:01:32.92 --> 01:01:39.16 laughing you like bro it's so much easier to make boots and it is to make to to weave fabric on a
01:01:39.16 --> 01:01:44.68 loop yeah and I think some of that laughter was more like I'm ready for the challenge you know what
01:01:44.68 --> 01:01:49.80 I mean like this is the thing is is you know and just in full transparency you know you and I
01:01:49.80 --> 01:01:54.12 had a private conversation at the end of the last year and like okay what are we gonna do you know
01:01:54.12 --> 01:02:00.28 what are we gonna do to grow and we wanted to make the investment you know of our profit and put it
01:02:00.28 --> 01:02:09.000 back into the company and and we're identifying where we want to grow right and what's going
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.56 to have the biggest impact on the community but also what the community can handle right and we
01:02:13.56 --> 01:02:19.88 know they can handle making denim blue jeans and I knew the community could not only handle but
01:02:19.88 --> 01:02:26.36 but if we could make footwear again I just need to clarify this when you're talking about the
01:02:26.36 --> 01:02:31.88 community what you're talking about is the actual community within which you live within which are
01:02:31.88 --> 01:02:38.84 factory is within which we have a pool of people that's the community that actually have this skill set
01:02:38.84 --> 01:02:45.72 and that's the part that I didn't appreciate and as soon as you you were like hey because I'm thinking
01:02:45.72 --> 01:02:50.52 how are we gonna make shoes you said we got the people and then I remember growing up of course
01:02:50.52 --> 01:02:56.04 who is up here all these massive shoe manufacturers were up here and I said oh yeah obviously okay
01:02:56.04 --> 01:03:04.92 check run exactly I mean shit I mean new balance is still in main doing some stuff
01:03:06.04 --> 01:03:14.20 Nike used to be in main you had you had basho you had dexter shoe you had Hayden shoe
01:03:14.20 --> 01:03:21.72 Allen Edmunds I mean you had all these brands and one of our employees Christine she actually
01:03:21.72 --> 01:03:28.28 was the one who went to the Dominican when the free trade agreements went into play and trained them
01:03:28.28 --> 01:03:33.56 on she was the best little waist stitcher in the country she trained them how to use that machine
01:03:34.20 --> 01:03:39.96 so she was part of let's call it a brain drain a skills drain right where the skills need to
01:03:39.96 --> 01:03:45.96 go away well happens when they go away she's the only one left with those skills right and I had
01:03:45.96 --> 01:03:51.48 identified a few people with those skills and these old shoe dogs one of them was Bart Hershey
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:57.08 you know and the sold guy Roland land and shoe dog is the name of that book is that a term
01:03:57.08 --> 01:04:02.68 anyways shoe dogs yeah there's a book written uh yeah it's by the guy that made Nike exactly yeah
01:04:02.68 --> 01:04:08.04 shoe dog but that's a common term he didn't coin that no no that's what these guys are he was
01:04:08.04 --> 01:04:14.76 part of that god all these guys helped him get started this guy Roland is the one that
01:04:14.76 --> 01:04:19.40 helped Timberland start he's the one that had the machinery and the knowledge to get
01:04:19.40 --> 01:04:25.64 Timberland so they could mold a soul onto a leather offer he he developed that and so I had all these
01:04:25.64 --> 01:04:32.60 old timers who I had just honestly I didn't give an opportunity not to not to meet me like I just
01:04:32.60 --> 01:04:37.08 go to their factory calm on the phone you know show them what we're doing and getting front of them
01:04:37.08 --> 01:04:44.12 and then finally we started building relationships and this this one guy Roland I went over there
01:04:44.12 --> 01:04:51.80 and and he had to get rid of some machinery and we did some kind of negotiating and I was like
01:04:51.80 --> 01:04:56.28 what do you what do you want you know yeah I got to figure out what somebody wants yeah you know
01:04:56.28 --> 01:05:03.000 we ended up negotiating he's like can you do a lobster bake from my staff and I said yeah
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.92 he goes take it all loaded up a tractor trailer of machinery a small if I can 20 foot you know
01:05:11.64 --> 01:05:18.36 and a couple weeks ago Joe my father learned I and a few other guys from the factory went out
01:05:18.36 --> 01:05:25.88 and cooked his whole staff a lobster bake lobster bake for old shoe machinery but these shoe dogs
01:05:25.88 --> 01:05:31.88 so shoe dog is the term that is just used it's a general term for someone who's been in the
01:05:31.88 --> 01:05:39.08 industry for a long time but you know as we were talking at the end of the last year and you know I
01:05:39.08 --> 01:05:45.96 kind of put your I guess concerns that ease a little bit for sure for no it's like we can make shoes
01:05:45.96 --> 01:05:51.32 you know we don't have to reinvent anything even though we need to build it from scratch there's
01:05:51.32 --> 01:05:56.84 a difference there you know if we're going to like try to figure it out and not have the knowledge that
01:05:56.84 --> 01:06:03.88 would be one thing but the knowledge has only been it's only been removed for 20 years right if it
01:06:03.88 --> 01:06:11.32 had been removed for 50 years I'm not going to say it's impossible but I would have taken a lot
01:06:11.96 --> 01:06:20.28 larger effort and a lot bigger a lot more costly tuition yes the tuition in the effort right now
01:06:20.28 --> 01:06:27.96 has been great and and the expenses been great I mean we're in month 8 and this week we're finally
01:06:27.96 --> 01:06:35.56 ready to really launch as you saw the factory the other day but you're talking about okay
01:06:35.56 --> 01:06:40.68 Jocco Jocco's blessing you know the teams on board what are we going to do I had one person
01:06:40.68 --> 01:06:50.04 one person Henry and he'd been in the industry for 40 years and he started January first
01:06:50.84 --> 01:06:56.68 I gave him a piece of paper with how I wanted the boot to look and I said this is what we want to build
01:06:58.28 --> 01:07:05.08 now just just so you know everyone understands I know you get it that we're talking about starting
01:07:05.08 --> 01:07:11.56 something from scratch all right we don't have any machinery we don't have asses and seats which is
01:07:11.56 --> 01:07:18.92 my way of saying human resources we don't have the workflow we don't have the raw materials we
01:07:18.92 --> 01:07:24.68 don't have the patterns we don't have the dice zero I gave him a piece of paper with an
01:07:24.68 --> 01:07:34.04 illustrator drawing and said this is what we want to make that's crazy not really not really crazy
01:07:34.04 --> 01:07:45.08 because if you can see when you when you see people work together we're each one has a skill set
01:07:45.08 --> 01:07:50.28 in in and I know this is like on the seal teams like I'm sure when you did operations and
01:07:50.28 --> 01:07:54.36 everything was just moving it's like a perfect but it's like a Russian ballet it's like a perfect flow
01:07:54.36 --> 01:08:01.88 of organization right and I had seen it in the rest of the factory and how we did the rest of the factory
01:08:01.88 --> 01:08:07.72 and that's why I knew we could do it but I also knew that the challenges of building something for a foot
01:08:07.72 --> 01:08:11.32 you know that that a foot everyone's feet are different and they're they're they're they're
01:08:11.32 --> 01:08:17.88 odd shaped they're asymmetrical you know it's a strange thing a foot a new we're going to have
01:08:17.88 --> 01:08:24.20 challenges asymmetrical they're not the same they're not the same I knew we were going to have challenges
01:08:24.76 --> 01:08:28.76 and I know I haven't told you about all the tuition payments but I'm going to tell you I'm
01:08:28.76 --> 01:08:38.92 going to tell you about the couple that I'm in skip what happened all my money so we we got into it
01:08:38.92 --> 01:08:43.80 and you know and we made some boots you know to start off but it was all you know Henry with an
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:49.16 exacto knife like hand cutting everything whatever we started building the patterns they weren't
01:08:49.16 --> 01:08:54.68 perfect so you got to imagine like eight months we're now into this thing eight months
01:08:54.68 --> 01:09:05.24 once once we actually got a boot of course he started with a 14 wrong and that would bite us
01:09:05.24 --> 01:09:11.48 in the ass six months down the road that was that was the tuition payment I wanted him to start with a
01:09:11.48 --> 01:09:19.64 14 because I wanted to wear it first not knowing that six months down the road that would be a
01:09:19.64 --> 01:09:25.24 mistake because you never grade grading is how you scale everything you never grade from your
01:09:25.24 --> 01:09:29.88 largest size you always grade from the middle from the middle size yeah so I should have
01:09:29.88 --> 01:09:34.76 I should have made your size first you should ask me too because if you just asked me that question
01:09:34.76 --> 01:09:39.32 I would have said oh yeah because you probably lose a little bit of you lose a little bit of that shape
01:09:39.32 --> 01:09:46.52 and the what's the word the ratio the ratio the ratio is as you go up exactly that's what grading is
01:09:46.52 --> 01:09:56.84 yep so we needed all those things patterns to fit the foot leather we needed the knowledge of course
01:09:57.80 --> 01:10:04.44 clicker dies to cut the material but most of all we need shoemaking machinery so which these are very
01:10:04.44 --> 01:10:10.92 specialized machines incredibly specialized materials very specialized in it wasn't feasible to just
01:10:10.92 --> 01:10:19.48 buy new stuff you know I mean would it have been smartest to buy all new machinery yes yes it would have
01:10:19.48 --> 01:10:27.16 been interesting it would have been smartest if we wanted to take that risk and don't that amount of
01:10:27.16 --> 01:10:33.80 capital in it I was gonna say because it doesn't seem like that would be real smart exactly but you know
01:10:33.80 --> 01:10:40.68 what I knew I knew that Henry used to be a mill right and that if we could just get decent machinery
01:10:40.68 --> 01:10:45.88 even old machinery that was running he could keep it running and our little proof of concept
01:10:45.88 --> 01:10:53.32 called bringing back shoe manufacturing and Franklin County main if we could prove that concept it
01:10:53.32 --> 01:11:00.68 would be only a matter of time to be able to invest in in that new machinery so that's what we did
01:11:00.68 --> 01:11:06.60 we talked about how much is gonna be a lot alright let's do it so I ended up calling this old
01:11:06.60 --> 01:11:14.12 time or mo he's the one that found our first loom so I went back to the source mo this is what I want
01:11:14.12 --> 01:11:21.56 to do and he's wild you know this guy he he told me a story you you have heard of Dexter shoe of course
01:11:22.76 --> 01:11:30.52 there was a man named Harold Alphan no Harold Alphan built Dexter shoe he built it he was working
01:11:30.52 --> 01:11:36.44 at another shoe company he built it by loading up machines that weren't being used like in the
01:11:37.16 --> 01:11:43.24 during the night time into his station wagon and driving them to a mill in Dexter he basically took
01:11:43.24 --> 01:11:48.28 the machines that were like the abandoned machines from the southern factory and he started
01:11:48.28 --> 01:11:56.36 a factory and he built an empire alright Harold Alphan he got bought out by Berkshire Hathaway
01:11:56.36 --> 01:12:02.92 they had a contract that when Harold Alphan died they could move Dexter shoe out of Maine
01:12:04.28 --> 01:12:09.000 Harold Alphan died a few years back they shot the factory down and moved the down of Maine
01:12:11.32 --> 01:12:15.000 this shit just it man it gets to me it gets to me
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:26.60 mo told me a story about Harold Alphan because mo's dad was an old shoe dog and he made the
01:12:26.60 --> 01:12:33.08 parts for the machine and he said let me tell you something you're gonna need my help doing this
01:12:34.84 --> 01:12:43.96 this is what I do this guy Harold Alphan he started this factory and he couldn't he wasn't
01:12:43.96 --> 01:12:49.48 getting it it wasn't making any money and he called my dad and he said can you come up to the factory
01:12:49.48 --> 01:12:55.24 and this is back when it doesn't matter if this small time or trying to build this this shoe company
01:12:56.44 --> 01:13:01.40 hasn't even started selling product yet it's in the hole maybe has a handful of employees
01:13:01.40 --> 01:13:08.44 this guy's most dad drives up to Dexter two hours sits in front of Harold Alphan and Harold Alphan says
01:13:08.44 --> 01:13:18.28 can you buy these box of parts back from me I'll buy them back from you in three months
01:13:20.68 --> 01:13:27.80 and his dad said yeah I'll take them back took the parts back gave him the money three months later
01:13:27.80 --> 01:13:33.56 Harold Alphan bought him back this guy's worth I don't know a billion dollars now but this
01:13:33.56 --> 01:13:39.000 this thing of sitting in front of somebody and having a conversation and building relationships
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.64 what I found in this shoe making thing is the most important thing because these are still the
01:13:45.64 --> 01:13:53.24 guys running it the same guys running it in the in the in the dudes these shoe dogs that have been
01:13:53.24 --> 01:14:03.000 in the factory helping us combine age 88 90 and we've probably had a dozen in there and you should
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:10.84 see their freaking eyeballs when they walk in they don't want to leave honestly on occasion
01:14:10.84 --> 01:14:17.72 bringing tears to their eyes that that this is what we're doing because they saw it they were part of
01:14:17.72 --> 01:14:25.16 it and they saw it leave and just that spark man like you know I'm honestly just hit me
01:14:25.16 --> 01:14:30.76 it's me right in the feels man that spark they see it's motivation and I absolutely knew that
01:14:30.76 --> 01:14:41.000 were there support it was going to be possible and so we've been grinding this the first pair of boots
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.04 that that I got that you sent me the first pair of the boots you sent me it was better than the first
01:14:46.04 --> 01:14:51.000 pair of jeans you sent me that that was a shocker to me like it was like take them out of the box I was like
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.32 no way this is ridiculous and and you know you're like hey there's there these aren't perfect
01:14:57.32 --> 01:15:00.84 from sending them just so you can look at them and I was like no I'm wearing them I mean I was wearing
01:15:00.84 --> 01:15:07.24 them out of the box comfortable crazy that was crazy I was like bro what's wrong with your jeans
01:15:07.24 --> 01:15:13.96 dude you got like we had to figure out how to make jeans you know I mean we're as we had the
01:15:13.96 --> 01:15:20.44 knowledge base to make the footwear like it was still here you know and man I mean these guys
01:15:20.44 --> 01:15:24.92 came in and they just like dumped their knowledge on but Henry Henry being the key in this guy
01:15:24.92 --> 01:15:31.40 mole and so I'm like I need machinery so he found all the old machinery overseas he brought it back
01:15:31.40 --> 01:15:37.96 over on a purely bringing machinery that's been shipped overseas you're along with the jobs
01:15:37.96 --> 01:15:44.44 literally we're bringing it back to America you know actually happening actually happening
01:15:44.44 --> 01:15:50.68 machines designed in New Hampshire and it machines designed in Massachusetts manufactured
01:15:50.68 --> 01:15:57.48 right there bringing them back these old machines and Mo refurbished them and now they're in the
01:15:57.48 --> 01:16:06.36 factory and it's badass so what's the where we out right now I know we have the the leather for
01:16:07.32 --> 01:16:15.16 400 500 pairs yeah you know we we connected with the tannery that's 45 minutes away that's
01:16:15.16 --> 01:16:23.16 nothing about supply chain right there's one tannery left in Maine and they just happened to
01:16:23.16 --> 01:16:30.68 manufacture all the leather for the military boots so we went up to them and they're like we'll
01:16:30.68 --> 01:16:35.96 we'll help you guys however we can so they're tanning leather for us they're tanning seven styles
01:16:35.96 --> 01:16:42.76 leather and it took a while to get it right I mean it's you gotta remember like leather like text
01:16:42.76 --> 01:16:48.52 styles depending on how it's tanned it can be you know it can stretch more be more rigid and not
01:16:48.52 --> 01:16:55.56 form right it can wrinkle you know there's all sorts of shit that can happen that that's really bad so
01:16:55.56 --> 01:16:59.88 anyways we have to get through all of that and we have to get through that and make sure the patterns
01:16:59.88 --> 01:17:08.68 were right and then we ordered the dies and we started cutting and it was wrong because
01:17:08.68 --> 01:17:18.28 we had graded them from the 14's so we may have lost 10 or 15 grand on dies I know but
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:29.72 but we we reordered the dies and now we've got them working but yeah so we have probably 500
01:17:29.72 --> 01:17:35.40 pairs cut ready ready to go and we lean many facts out the line and we're in the process of
01:17:35.40 --> 01:17:41.64 training the young folks now we have a young girl Nikki she's 19 another guy who's in there
01:17:41.64 --> 01:17:46.44 Christine and Henry those two combined experience like 80 years you know the little way
01:17:46.44 --> 01:17:52.68 stitches telling you about and Henry and we're like literally once you and I have a conversation like
01:17:52.68 --> 01:17:59.08 hey we should we turn it on we'll just turn it on we'll turn it on and we need to turn it on
01:17:59.08 --> 01:18:03.56 in the factory right now before we move it you know to the new plan because it's got it's got to work
01:18:03.56 --> 01:18:08.76 there first we've got to have the proof of the concept worked out but man I put I put a ton of
01:18:08.76 --> 01:18:15.40 miles on those boots and man they're wearing in nicely yeah nicely so it's it's a classic
01:18:16.04 --> 01:18:22.12 it's what boots it's like boots that's what they are their boots boots man you know what they
01:18:22.12 --> 01:18:28.04 go well with jeans yeah I love the fact that we like we we're calling the jeans legit fit
01:18:28.04 --> 01:18:35.96 you know now while we're doing all this meanwhile I'm out starting jockel publishing you know
01:18:35.96 --> 01:18:42.12 I have a I'm like hey man by the way I've got you know whatever I'm gonna be I got 100,000 books
01:18:42.12 --> 01:18:48.04 that you know I'm gonna need to get moved from place to place we have a fulfillment center
01:18:48.04 --> 01:18:52.52 like you're like yes we do and boom all of a sudden next you know we we got a fulfillment center we got
01:18:52.52 --> 01:18:58.92 the warrior kid three we got Mikey the Dragons there you're we just absorb that it was like
01:18:58.92 --> 01:19:05.56 it was one of those things that I'll give me the freedom to tell my publisher watch this on
01:19:05.56 --> 01:19:09.72 publishing you know I got a publishing company now watch this and to have the freedom to be able to
01:19:09.72 --> 01:19:15.64 do that was phenomenal because I knew I was like okay well I can make this happen because they're
01:19:15.64 --> 01:19:21.000 looking at it going how the hell where where are you gonna we're gonna store 100,000 books how
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.64 you gonna politicize books who's gonna you we jocke or you're gonna be in a warehouse somewhere
01:19:25.64 --> 01:19:29.16 palatizing books you know while you're trying to write another book and do all the other stuff
01:19:29.16 --> 01:19:32.36 that you're doing that's not gonna work so they're in the back of their mind they're thinking
01:19:32.36 --> 01:19:37.96 I'm an idiot yeah thinking it's impossible which is which is a common theme around here people think
01:19:37.96 --> 01:19:42.84 things are impossible and you know I there's another thing I was saying the other day and you were
01:19:42.84 --> 01:19:49.000 that you kind of reminded me of this of when you started down the path of hey I'm gonna make
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.84 keys here and I'll put something they're telling you people are telling you it's impossible to do this
01:19:54.84 --> 01:20:02.20 some people are possible to do this and the reason that that that that that that propaganda is out there
01:20:02.20 --> 01:20:09.24 is because the big corporations the best answer that they can give to the American people and they say
01:20:09.24 --> 01:20:13.56 hey why are you shutting down this factory the best answer that they can give us oh it's impossible
01:20:13.56 --> 01:20:19.48 to manufacture here that's what it is it's impossible to manufacture here that's their answer that
01:20:19.48 --> 01:20:27.72 way they can save an extra 32 cents per item by having it manufactured in China where they
01:20:27.72 --> 01:20:32.44 where they they still have to pay shipping they still have to pay customs they have to pay to get it
01:20:32.44 --> 01:20:37.16 over there's all kinds of but it's not like they're saying it's not like all those laborers
01:20:37.16 --> 01:20:44.68 only get a dollar a day so therefore we're saving 80 or whatever 12 dollars an item no they're actually
01:20:44.68 --> 01:20:49.72 we'll all be at the costs they're saving 32 cents an item by paying somebody over there a dollar
01:20:49.72 --> 01:20:54.84 a day and by taking a job from an American sending it overseas so the best answer that they can
01:20:54.84 --> 01:20:59.40 can give isn't well we want to make an extra 32 cents an item the best answer that they can give
01:20:59.40 --> 01:21:07.000 is this is impossible to do here can't manufacture in American anymore that's what that's what
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.48 we are being told we're being lied to America's being lied to and I honestly feel because of the
01:21:13.48 --> 01:21:20.68 podcast I feel like you've made what we're doing and main the tip of the spear I mean and main
01:21:20.68 --> 01:21:25.56 is shaped like the tip of the spear which is even more badass and it is old school in the
01:21:25.56 --> 01:21:33.24 England it is which is even more badass but it's not impossible and like if you look at like
01:21:33.24 --> 01:21:37.80 we're here at the immersion camp I was sitting down with a woman she's in California we're
01:21:37.80 --> 01:21:42.20 sitting on the side of the mat she's from California she's a cop and she's just talking to
01:21:42.20 --> 01:21:47.56 me about her struggles about media and how they're making her out to be and her you know and
01:21:47.56 --> 01:21:54.44 folks in law enforcement and everything and and she said you know she's like what happened and I
01:21:54.44 --> 01:22:02.52 said and just clicked I'm sitting here looking at this mat full of 100 200 people from all
01:22:02.52 --> 01:22:15.08 different creeds skin colors backgrounds jobs from farmers to huge businessmen scientists
01:22:15.08 --> 01:22:24.84 to surgeons all on the mats for a common goal to train and learn jiu jitsu isn't that what
01:22:24.84 --> 01:22:32.84 America is together for a common goal isn't that how this country was built isn't that how New England
01:22:32.84 --> 01:22:40.92 was established when the immigrants came in together for a common goal and it's literally happening
01:22:40.92 --> 01:22:47.16 right in front of me and I just I just connected into it and I was just like what what's missing
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:55.56 well I can see here that this is all about minds and hands right jiu jitsu you know learning jiu jitsu
01:22:55.56 --> 01:23:00.84 it's not hard it's hard on your mind it's hard on your body it's hard on your hands you know
01:23:00.84 --> 01:23:06.20 and and manufacturing is is the same thing it's it's the same thing and and just
01:23:09.24 --> 01:23:15.40 understanding like and I know you know you're from Maine and Connecticut and New England and we both
01:23:15.40 --> 01:23:22.76 are and understanding where we came from and what was sacrificed so that we could get here
01:23:22.76 --> 01:23:29.64 I feel like we've abandoned that you know and I feel like jiu jitsu is like a spark you know looking
01:23:29.64 --> 01:23:35.32 at those matches like the spark like whoa wait a second I bet there's every type of political
01:23:35.32 --> 01:23:41.80 affiliation on the mats right now yeah for sure I've got unbelievable that these people are here
01:23:41.80 --> 01:23:51.000 smiling and just and just sheer enjoyment maybe jiu jitsu can solve the world's problems
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.84 and I don't know but but I do feel like we've abandoned so much well also when you take a kid
01:23:59.80 --> 01:24:06.60 and your kid says hey I want to do this and you tell him you can't do that what does that do the
01:24:06.60 --> 01:24:14.92 kid what does that do the kids kids well that's what we're out right now you can't do this you can't
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:20.84 do this in America and another thing is when it's like I want to build something you can't do it
01:24:21.88 --> 01:24:29.72 think about that you can't do it and that isn't attitude that used to not even remotely
01:24:29.72 --> 01:24:35.24 exist in America we were busy putting men on the moon and building the best cars and the best
01:24:35.24 --> 01:24:42.52 ships and the best planes in the world and winning wars and getting after it and all of a
01:24:42.52 --> 01:24:47.08 sudden we're looking around going oh you can't you the what's the fundamental for all that stuff
01:24:47.08 --> 01:24:52.12 built built built something and all of a sudden you're being told you can't build something
01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:03.72 the oh you have to manufacture overseas they manufacture better no no this is our blood we build things
01:25:03.72 --> 01:25:09.64 and when you take that away from someone what do they got it's wrong it's just wrong
01:25:10.84 --> 01:25:17.56 so I actually I actually like a little bit of the propaganda it just helps what we're doing
01:25:18.76 --> 01:25:26.20 we can just sneak up behind these folks and choke them out yeah the and it doesn't stop there
01:25:26.20 --> 01:25:31.64 we're going we're in a war on all fronts you know we got on top of all this we got origin labs
01:25:31.64 --> 01:25:39.80 yeah and we've put out tons of of new products and origin labs from but you know whatever
01:25:39.80 --> 01:25:45.000 being echo talk about that all the time the new products and new products but from a business perspective
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:53.88 I think one of the biggest challenges has been the go ready to drink in a can again
01:25:53.88 --> 01:26:04.36 it was one of these things where hey we want to make a drink that gives you energy but is not
01:26:04.36 --> 01:26:12.44 freaking horrible for you yeah which which which may seem like that's impossible that's impossible
01:26:12.44 --> 01:26:17.96 because you need it to taste good so it's got a have sugar you got to have it not be refrigerated
01:26:17.96 --> 01:26:22.84 so it's got to be have a bunch of chemicals in it to keep it from going spoiled and then you got to
01:26:22.84 --> 01:26:29.56 put 8 billion grams of caffeine in it so at least convinces a person that's drinking 10 billion
01:26:29.56 --> 01:26:35.72 and grams of caffeine a day that this is actually hitting them so it's all these hey that won't
01:26:35.72 --> 01:26:42.60 work no no no and that was the first thing how do we actually make something that I could look
01:26:42.60 --> 01:26:48.28 at a person and be like you should drink this it is good for you to drink this it will help you
01:26:48.28 --> 01:26:54.76 in your life and your brain and your athletic pursuits right now that's a big step it is
01:26:54.76 --> 01:27:00.68 you know and what's funny is like I remember the last conversation before we actually pulled
01:27:00.68 --> 01:27:07.88 the trigger on making a decision and you were like I'm not compromising we're changing the category
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.56 like this is poison you know the this category the energy treatment category the energy
01:27:13.56 --> 01:27:20.04 treatment category it's just straight poison and we're not conforming to the standard and you
01:27:20.04 --> 01:27:25.08 you made like it it's going to be as far as the caffeine thing when you kind of set that bar
01:27:25.80 --> 01:27:32.36 like I was I was on board you know and and I you know the thing is it's like I'm not a big
01:27:32.36 --> 01:27:39.64 caffeine drinker but and I know you're not a big caffeine drinker but literally like I would never
01:27:39.64 --> 01:27:46.28 ever allow my kids to get an energy drink are you kidding me yeah ever I think if I gave my kid an
01:27:46.28 --> 01:27:52.68 energy drink there would be mayhem in the world mayhem yeah so you know I mean just just being
01:27:52.68 --> 01:27:56.44 able to make that decision we're not going to conform and we're not going to compromise you know
01:27:56.44 --> 01:28:04.36 I mean that that started the challenge you know but and the other big one was was how do we
01:28:04.36 --> 01:28:12.28 make these things stay fresh right out the normal chemicals that they add to all these drinks
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.92 that keep them fresh to keep them for being spoiled and we're like let's do what they do with
01:28:16.92 --> 01:28:23.72 my mood milk pasteurizing pasteurization and so how many other drinks are there that you go
01:28:23.72 --> 01:28:29.08 into a store or you order or you pop open a can and it's pasteurized what's the number of drinks
01:28:29.08 --> 01:28:35.80 like that I think the number is zero yeah the number is zero again what's the what's the business
01:28:35.80 --> 01:28:41.24 decision the business decision well it's going to cost a lot more yeah it's going to cost a lot more
01:28:41.24 --> 01:28:48.20 to pasteurize these things it's going to cost a lot more to use monk fruit instead of whatever
01:28:48.20 --> 01:28:53.96 the freaking cancer carcinogens that they just pump into those things no we're going to use the best
01:28:53.96 --> 01:29:00.60 ingredients so all those little decisions along the way hey we could be wrong actually we could be wrong
01:29:00.60 --> 01:29:05.48 I'm it's worth the tuition payment I was going to say if we're wrong at least I'll be able to sleep
01:29:05.48 --> 01:29:11.64 exactly and I think that's what when you're distilled it down that's what it that's what you get right
01:29:11.64 --> 01:29:16.60 is you know you can cut corners in the way you start at this you can cut corners here there the other
01:29:16.60 --> 01:29:22.36 place but what is the right thing to do you know like with the genes what's the right thing to do
01:29:22.36 --> 01:29:25.64 well build the product that's going to last lifetime that's actually the right thing to do that
01:29:25.64 --> 01:29:30.84 will never fall apart right and it's the same thing with with all the nutritional stuff because
01:29:30.84 --> 01:29:37.000 there's so much junk and you know my son's 16 I will only let him take malt for protein or
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.68 reward kid either one of those I'll let him take I'll let him touch any of that other shit he's
01:29:40.68 --> 01:29:46.52 going to be 17 my daughter's turned 14 you know it's like there's things they're exposed to and
01:29:46.52 --> 01:29:55.24 there's propaganda in this industry pushing this poison at kids and honestly like they're at the
01:29:55.24 --> 01:30:01.08 point where they're mobile you know I know your son's mobile too where they're making decisions
01:30:01.08 --> 01:30:09.72 stopping at the store grabbing things to drink grabbing snacks and I actually I'm on them all the time
01:30:09.72 --> 01:30:14.36 what'd you eat today what'd you pick up at the store what'd you drink today you know I'm on
01:30:14.36 --> 01:30:19.80 them about it because they know how important it is to me that they make good choices
01:30:20.76 --> 01:30:27.24 with the occasional you know double cheeseburger at my dogs which I may partake in once in a while
01:30:28.52 --> 01:30:37.72 but yeah there is a you don't usually find that in in the categories and in this industry
01:30:37.72 --> 01:30:41.56 in the nutritional you know you just you find people looking at those things and
01:30:41.56 --> 01:30:51.88 I think that ultimately ultimately honestly without your podcast I think it would be almost impossible
01:30:52.76 --> 01:31:01.24 I think it would be almost impossible without without you explaining the people what's going on here
01:31:01.24 --> 01:31:05.48 well then you might as well have said it's not really the podcast to people that are listening to the podcast
01:31:05.48 --> 01:31:10.20 sure it's not me it's the people that are listening to podcasts that go okay yep
01:31:10.20 --> 01:31:17.48 we're on board that's what it is yeah and so thanks to everyone that listens to this podcast
01:31:18.04 --> 01:31:23.88 because otherwise we wouldn't be doing much of what we're doing right now no absolutely I mean
01:31:23.88 --> 01:31:29.16 did you get all these like you know these Netflix specials and stuff you know and like what makes you
01:31:29.16 --> 01:31:35.000 fat or like the truth about sugar you know or you know all these things there's all these new
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.64 so there's there is kind of awakening I guess I would call it and awakening about what you're
01:31:41.64 --> 01:31:47.24 putting in your body it's happening it's happening and I think you're a part of that awakening I
01:31:47.24 --> 01:31:52.04 think you're a big part of that awakening letting people know hey you got to watch what you're
01:31:52.04 --> 01:31:58.28 putting in your body but I'm gonna make something that I want to put in my body you know and I
01:31:58.28 --> 01:32:02.76 think that's a you know that value proposition that you'd sound reliable you know it's
01:32:02.76 --> 01:32:07.40 undeniable and we're not gonna compromise on that that's undeniable and if it doesn't work out at
01:32:07.40 --> 01:32:12.20 least we did the right thing that's undeniable yeah it's like chasing the truck back to the cotton field
01:32:12.20 --> 01:32:18.20 that's where you're gonna end up so you can't argue with it yeah I think it's the right decision
01:32:18.20 --> 01:32:24.76 my wife the other day I came home and she says do you have a vitamin exponder or like a high
01:32:24.76 --> 01:32:30.12 speed blender do you have those young blend tech is it okay one of those like big high speed
01:32:30.12 --> 01:32:35.64 blenders oh like the ninja I don't know but it's a big like it's almost like an industrial blender
01:32:36.28 --> 01:32:41.24 okay so I have one of those and the other day but I normally don't use it because I just use a
01:32:41.24 --> 01:32:47.000 shaker cup right when I'm making some milk of whatever flavor so and everyone in my family just
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:53.000 uses a shaker cup occasionally someone decides to kick in the the the Vitamix so I come home the other
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000 day and my wife goes you know she's like oh hi hi and then she says I had strawberry milk
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:07.32 in the Vitamix and I said and and she said she said this it's the best thing I've ever tasted
01:33:07.32 --> 01:33:16.04 in my life so my wife said she is seriously and you know she just she said it was so frothy
01:33:16.04 --> 01:33:24.60 so frothy so frothy and I said what did you have it she goes just milk and milk strawberry milk
01:33:24.60 --> 01:33:31.96 and when I saw it because my wife you know she's a she's a world a worldly person I guess you know
01:33:31.96 --> 01:33:38.52 she likes to kind of find pallet and she likes different kinds of things I'm not that right
01:33:38.52 --> 01:33:44.52 for me to be like this tastes good that has limited merit right can I share the wooden sword
01:33:44.52 --> 01:33:51.16 thing the wooden sword was wooden sword that's so I can I can help assist painting the picture
01:33:51.16 --> 01:33:56.04 of Helen go ahead we're in your like hey we need to build a wooden sword we're on the phone
01:33:56.04 --> 01:34:01.08 of the day oh we need to build a wood sword we need to build a wood sword do like a special for
01:34:01.08 --> 01:34:06.60 for my king the dragon's little wooden sword and I wouldn't shield in the back interaction
01:34:06.60 --> 01:34:15.000 jocco that's about barbed wire I died laughing that's barbaric because I want a little
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.40 kids to have shields and swords and wooden which is not so much we just like the only thing I
01:34:19.40 --> 01:34:24.28 played with until I figured out that there was a machine gun then I had a machine gun right
01:34:24.28 --> 01:34:28.04 what did you think is a great idea for we should do that for like this Christmas or something like
01:34:28.04 --> 01:34:33.80 build wooden swords with a mic and a dragon shield yeah if it would dragon on it yeah be bad
01:34:33.80 --> 01:34:39.96 attitude if I was a kid and I got that yes I'd be chopping at everything yes I don't know that
01:34:39.96 --> 01:34:46.12 because I mean we had wooden swords as kids yeah but and then they turned them into foam yeah I was
01:34:46.12 --> 01:34:51.40 gonna say that's the thing is now they may come from because then you can't hurt anybody which I get
01:34:51.96 --> 01:34:57.88 maybe you need to maybe need to parent your kids and say hey Billy don't hit Jennifer
01:34:57.88 --> 01:35:04.84 in the head with a wooden sword like don't do that it's called parenting let's try it or you just
01:35:04.84 --> 01:35:09.32 put a helmet on him and put foam everything put him in a padded room and now we don't have to worry
01:35:09.32 --> 01:35:18.52 about it you don't have it anymore so shit all that stuff together I mean it's it's growth
01:35:18.84 --> 01:35:26.60 right now when you look at the growth right now I mean do you see any hesitation in the growth
01:35:27.48 --> 01:35:33.32 zero do you see acceleration in the growth yes are you are you nervous
01:35:33.32 --> 01:35:42.76 I think I I don't know if nervous is the right word you know I mean number one I love the process
01:35:43.56 --> 01:35:50.52 and I hope the process never stops I don't I mean to think of something ending like what we're
01:35:50.52 --> 01:35:55.72 doing I just you know I say well you really have four decades of opportunity and I've told you
01:35:55.72 --> 01:36:02.20 this before you know one of my advisors John I have to introduce you to you next time we're farming
01:36:02.20 --> 01:36:08.12 ten said hey hey you've got four decades of opportunity you know your first 20 years you're learning
01:36:08.12 --> 01:36:13.40 you've got 40 years to do and then hopefully you enjoy the fruits of your labor you know and
01:36:13.40 --> 01:36:20.68 and I'm in I'm in the second decade right 20 to 30 30 to 40 turn 40 February second decade like
01:36:21.56 --> 01:36:27.96 the process man the process is what gives me excited being in the game you know not standing
01:36:27.96 --> 01:36:34.60 on the sidelines not being a former player watching you know the new blood play you know I love
01:36:34.60 --> 01:36:40.68 being in the game you know and and I think that to be in the game you're gonna be a little bit
01:36:40.68 --> 01:36:45.40 nervous you're gonna have butterflies because that's what being part of the team is that's
01:36:45.40 --> 01:36:51.80 what being in the game means and if you know and if you don't have that then you you're arrogant
01:36:51.80 --> 01:36:58.68 and or maybe you're complacent right but if you're in the game you've got to feel that thing that's
01:36:58.68 --> 01:37:05.96 driving you to get up every morning you know and and I love it I love it you know that's
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:15.16 truly my passion is being in the game not what the not not winning the game not winning the
01:37:15.16 --> 01:37:22.60 championship not looking to to an end goal like if we achieve this we've won you know it's it's just
01:37:23.24 --> 01:37:27.96 it's just if we achieve this what can we do next exactly where can we go from there exactly
01:37:28.52 --> 01:37:35.80 I look at one thing that I like doing and I like being a part of and one thing that I like
01:37:35.80 --> 01:37:46.04 about working with you is it doesn't seem like I can say hey I think we need to do this and I know
01:37:46.04 --> 01:37:53.08 that it it's gonna be really really hard but we can do it and you're like oh yes we can you know
01:37:53.08 --> 01:37:59.000 as opposed to the nine reasons or the twelve reasons or the forty seven reasons why
01:37:59.64 --> 01:38:02.84 well you know there's this problem there's that problem there's that problem
01:38:02.84 --> 01:38:10.28 I never I never hear that from you I know you don't hear it from me it's hey this is where
01:38:10.28 --> 01:38:18.12 we're at this seems like it would be crazy to do let's do it yes here's how we can make it happen
01:38:19.64 --> 01:38:28.60 yeah and to touch on that and the fact that there has been this propaganda delivered to our minds
01:38:28.60 --> 01:38:35.64 over the past twenty thirty years whatever it's been I was talking to a woman recently and she's
01:38:35.64 --> 01:38:41.24 the one that saved that first alone when when the Chinese came in and they purchased up this
01:38:41.24 --> 01:38:45.48 mill when loosened and made and they pulled everything out she saved this loom I had her on my podcast
01:38:45.48 --> 01:38:55.96 actually and it's Rachel and the biggest thing that that built the infrastructure for the New England
01:38:55.96 --> 01:39:03.80 mills were the canal systems and if you pulled the stones out of like the canal system in
01:39:03.80 --> 01:39:10.04 Lewiston you could build another great pyramid if you pulled the granite out of these canal
01:39:10.04 --> 01:39:16.84 systems you could build another great pyramid think about what they did a hundred years ago
01:39:16.84 --> 01:39:23.88 in Lewiston Maine they built a great pyramid in the form of a canal system and they did it
01:39:23.88 --> 01:39:30.84 without technology they couldn't look up leg twist in jeans and solve the problem right we can
01:39:31.24 --> 01:39:36.60 so to say it can't be done I'd never say that we've got technology we've still got people that
01:39:36.60 --> 01:39:42.28 know we've got jets that can get us you know you can jump in on a jet blue flight and get to Europe
01:39:42.28 --> 01:39:47.56 in eight hours or twelve hours if you need to go see how something works or if I need to go to
01:39:47.56 --> 01:39:52.60 California if I need to just drive to low Massachusetts I mean you have the opportunity to travel
01:39:52.60 --> 01:39:58.20 quickly you're not getting on a boat on the ocean and that's what they were doing they were transporting
01:39:58.20 --> 01:40:04.04 this stuff with horse and buggy on rails across the ocean and you're telling me it's impossible
01:40:04.84 --> 01:40:13.48 are you freaking kidding me this is the easiest time we've ever had to do this and that's why it's
01:40:13.48 --> 01:40:20.60 not crazy because of what we do have we're fortunate to be in a day and age where we can get
01:40:20.60 --> 01:40:26.28 information like that you know it's just a matter of putting hands and dirt that's what people are
01:40:26.28 --> 01:40:33.56 scared of you know they don't know how good calluses feel if they did and it'd be a different
01:40:33.56 --> 01:40:41.96 it'd be a different world right now so again fortunate and and being in New England being in
01:40:41.96 --> 01:40:50.84 this part of of Maine knowing that that feeling may have been abandoned or the people may have been
01:40:50.84 --> 01:40:58.52 abandoned and showing him no you haven't been abandoned actually this is cyclical and we know that
01:40:58.52 --> 01:41:04.84 we're still the best at this let's just make it happen again let's get back in the game let's get back
01:41:04.84 --> 01:41:13.16 on the field let's make it happen again just being part of that let's get to work let's get to work awesome
01:41:14.44 --> 01:41:20.04 seems like a good place to wrap it up echo Charles yes how's it going over there pretty cool
01:41:20.04 --> 01:41:27.16 speaking of getting to work yeah we like to work in various various modalities yeah I've never heard
01:41:27.16 --> 01:41:34.04 that word really modalities yeah and I love expanding vocabulary explain it to me different modes
01:41:34.04 --> 01:41:39.88 different modes yeah modality different modalities one modality might be we want to get smarter
01:41:40.60 --> 01:41:47.40 right we want to train our brain right we want to train our our our a real bit capacity sure we want
01:41:47.40 --> 01:41:56.20 to train our defensive capabilities yes we want to train our strength we want to train our reflexes
01:41:57.56 --> 01:42:01.24 I mean we're just want to train in a bunch of different modalities do you know anything that really
01:42:01.24 --> 01:42:07.64 helps across a broad spectrum spectrum of modalities like that echo Charles yes and what would that be
01:42:07.64 --> 01:42:13.24 well one is jiu jitsu what the energy and immersion cap immersing immersing our self right that's
01:42:13.24 --> 01:42:17.96 the word right immersing yes yeah immersing ourselves you know everybody's ripped off immersion camp now
01:42:18.60 --> 01:42:24.92 oh really oh yeah yeah yeah yeah all the the who's who of jiu jitsu were doing immersion camps okay
01:42:24.92 --> 01:42:30.12 yeah well good flattering that's awesome yeah no it's also more people are training yeah immersing
01:42:30.12 --> 01:42:36.60 themselves in jiu jitsu because yes very useful as a modality of improvement for sure
01:42:37.48 --> 01:42:43.40 mental physical anyway we're here vocabulary vocabulary modality is vocabulary modality
01:42:43.40 --> 01:42:46.68 well I'm just saying we are apparently we're improving our vocabulary tonight across the board
01:42:46.68 --> 01:42:53.88 yes using immersive modality immersive modality yeah yes yeah so you know you talk about the new
01:42:53.88 --> 01:42:59.96 riff-gui I agree 100% every element that you brought up 100% echo I'm going to interrupt you
01:43:00.28 --> 01:43:05.88 even though this is your time not an I's our time got you did you know what we did
01:43:06.68 --> 01:43:16.20 for you the last four days did you connect the dots oh wait no if I no you know you got a
01:43:16.20 --> 01:43:24.84 ge when you got here yes you know who else got those gees yeah juggle what do you mean what
01:43:24.84 --> 01:43:32.52 color was it back did you see anybody else got a blackie juggle kind of well's
01:43:33.32 --> 01:43:39.40 I don't know all the other instructor all the other black belts oh if you had if you had
01:43:39.40 --> 01:43:43.96 peripheral vision would you know by the way you wouldn't have known wasn't what was about the
01:43:43.96 --> 01:43:53.72 happy juggle right there yeah yeah yeah this was he was concerned yeah he goes if I give
01:43:53.72 --> 01:43:58.12 echo this do you think he's gonna know and I was like no I'll just think that it's the
01:43:58.12 --> 01:44:02.36 camp gear something yeah oh me back oh got his black belt by the way for anyone that's listening
01:44:02.36 --> 01:44:08.60 that didn't hear this yet we'll do a whole podcast about that we we made 15 blackies for the
01:44:08.60 --> 01:44:13.64 expert the black belt experts you being wonderful yeah and speak holy stuff thank you
01:44:13.64 --> 01:44:17.80 come on don't leave you hand so cool so cool and it's funny because it's like you
01:44:17.80 --> 01:44:21.24 to and you know juggle told me a few other things you know this and it's like you know
01:44:21.24 --> 01:44:25.96 like when you watch fight club you know here watch I'm a little bit too much you know like you're
01:44:25.96 --> 01:44:31.08 like oh I didn't want to look at you oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and you know at the end of
01:44:31.08 --> 01:44:35.40 fight club this is big like you know what he called you yes right then you watch it again you're like
01:44:35.40 --> 01:44:40.12 oh I see all the little bit that same you start connecting stuff I'm experiencing right now
01:44:40.12 --> 01:44:46.68 if you guys don't the last we talked about the riff key black or otherwise that is a reinvented
01:44:46.68 --> 01:44:52.92 scenario right there yeah really good and the thing is I do prefered no key over key but then
01:44:52.92 --> 01:44:57.96 after even that other one the other the one that I got because I got a riffed in another one that
01:44:57.96 --> 01:45:02.84 looks it looks different but it's different but it's also it's the same material yeah yeah yeah
01:45:02.84 --> 01:45:07.32 that was special we yeah yeah it's a special thing the same material the same
01:45:07.32 --> 01:45:12.36 same material the dragon we've gently we've gently we've just yeah I think that's the primary
01:45:12.36 --> 01:45:18.68 mover in that key feeling so good yes I get that the cut is also a factor yeah but the bigger
01:45:18.68 --> 01:45:25.64 factor that's that material the textiles ridiculous well because like I'd say like dries as you sweat
01:45:25.64 --> 01:45:30.04 yeah that's a weird thing and you can put it in the you can it's dry it's basically dry
01:45:30.04 --> 01:45:35.88 when you get done with the spin cycle final spin yeah yeah final slint layers when you get done with
01:45:35.88 --> 01:45:41.64 that then it's almost dry right then you could you could put it on the mat so that's it for anyone
01:45:41.64 --> 01:45:49.000 that had a knee before like in five years people be like oh yeah used to suck you staff to like
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.20 dry these things for eighty minutes to get dry now everyone's gonna be oh that was to be horrible
01:45:54.20 --> 01:46:00.28 you know it was like oh when I was a kid I used to have the phones were attached to the wall
01:46:00.28 --> 01:46:04.92 oh people like oh that's very horrible you know there's like oh I used to get my gear in the
01:46:04.92 --> 01:46:09.32 dryer for an hour and a half to get it dry oh that must have been horrible now we can
01:46:09.32 --> 01:46:15.000 trim it into the softening of society by making no we can trim more now it's true there we go more
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.72 jack you got saving power it's it's green right that's green yeah yeah to get a rift key
01:46:21.72 --> 01:46:26.92 yeah it's in there so yeah green there to get to unless it makes me want want to do more ghee
01:46:26.92 --> 01:46:31.40 just that little push and I think that's something this is what this is not what you have
01:46:31.40 --> 01:46:36.84 someone that is very focused on comfort a little extra comfort goes along with that
01:46:36.84 --> 01:46:43.64 you're just so if anyone's wondering which they aren't I would assume they are not wondering
01:46:43.64 --> 01:46:48.60 what get you get you get an origin geek it's not just the rift it's a whole spectrum
01:46:48.60 --> 01:46:53.40 while you're here okay I'm gonna give you some scenarios I just started you Jitsu I'm not looking
01:46:53.40 --> 01:47:00.52 to compete I'm gonna train three times a week my budget is tight what ghee should I get I would go
01:47:00.52 --> 01:47:06.44 with a comp ethletta okay which is still gonna give you the performance or we have that warrior
01:47:06.44 --> 01:47:10.60 line which is a lightweight ghee but it's it's more built for warmer environments you know the
01:47:10.60 --> 01:47:17.48 comp ethletta really is the right ghee to go okay yeah I'm I'm training six times a week
01:47:17.48 --> 01:47:27.48 I'm gonna compete I have a tight budget six times a week you want to compete tight budget
01:47:27.48 --> 01:47:32.76 I'd still go with a comp ethletta okay at what point do I step up and get a rift
01:47:32.76 --> 01:47:48.12 at what point do you want to improve I'm gonna tell you honestly right now if my budget was
01:47:48.12 --> 01:47:55.40 tight I would wait an extra two months and get a rift yeah it's a game changer product you know it's
01:47:55.40 --> 01:48:02.36 not it's hard to explain man like it like when you're underneath somebody you know like we're
01:48:02.36 --> 01:48:05.72 an old ghee let's say you're underneath somebody inside control you've been sweating the whole
01:48:05.72 --> 01:48:11.96 match your 10 minutes in and you need to like elbow escape or hip out and your arms stuck inside
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:18.52 the sleeve because of the abrasion of the the text what you're gonna feel is free you know so it
01:48:18.52 --> 01:48:23.72 gives you an advantage in that regard if you want to feel free on the mats even when you're
01:48:23.72 --> 01:48:30.52 getting crushed and smothered get a rift all right it's an advantage it's it's a way to cheat the
01:48:30.52 --> 01:48:36.76 system yeah okay yeah it's a whole comprehensive it's a whole period yeah yeah exactly like the
01:48:36.76 --> 01:48:41.000 reason you're like no ghee so much is you like that right the freedom of movement and everything
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.04 and you know it's almost provides that for you you know we need to engage your version of covering
01:48:46.04 --> 01:48:53.56 up his arms as well well because it's a massive yeah all right also we got what we just
01:48:53.56 --> 01:49:01.88 talked about jeans or jeans order those up we got t-shirts we got other clothes and we got
01:49:01.88 --> 01:49:06.36 supplements take it yeah all the different supplements yeah so I had I got the new
01:49:07.48 --> 01:49:14.60 which we haven't talked about yet cold or yeah yeah is that for a reason or we just now we're
01:49:14.60 --> 01:49:21.40 talking about it now okay boom so I got some that cold cold war krill oil joint warfare good snack
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:27.56 these are like the the the pre requisite supplements this is like to keep you in the game like
01:49:27.56 --> 01:49:33.48 it doesn't matter you can have you can have huge strength all this stuff but you if you can't
01:49:33.48 --> 01:49:37.48 keep yourself in the game like if you're on the sideline because injuries whatever you're not
01:49:37.48 --> 01:49:43.000 moving correctly you're sick all this stuff doesn't even matter so anyway I had that line
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.40 I had it dawned on me how these are the most important supplements that there are in my opinion
01:49:49.40 --> 01:49:53.80 yeah because without them you could possibly not be in the game yeah you can be the strongest
01:49:53.80 --> 01:49:59.40 guy but you're not even in the game you know you can't roll because whatever your neck is sore
01:49:59.40 --> 01:50:05.16 it's a whole lot of the joint warfare and I'm almost ready to go there you go you know you
01:50:05.16 --> 01:50:10.76 did to chocolate we were telling you how the cold the cold war came to be because he was getting
01:50:10.76 --> 01:50:16.12 off the airplane or something or you were traveling a lot yeah just what I'm like guys
01:50:16.12 --> 01:50:22.60 there was almost got sick I need like a hyper boost of you know all the stuff that prevents
01:50:22.60 --> 01:50:28.68 you from getting sick yeah and Brian's like cool let me pull me figure it out yeah we ran it
01:50:28.68 --> 01:50:34.92 and then I tested it and I'm like okay I've been traveling whatever it was six weeks no sickness
01:50:34.92 --> 01:50:40.28 that's like when I say sick you know you you know when you travel in the just like your nose
01:50:40.84 --> 01:50:45.16 you just you just like wake up your mouth tastes like crap yeah you feel like you're about to
01:50:45.16 --> 01:50:50.36 get sick yeah that I got like that yeah I don't like that it's pulling you maybe not out of the
01:50:50.36 --> 01:50:56.20 game but it's infringing on the game it's kind of jamming fringy yeah for infringement oh yeah
01:50:56.20 --> 01:51:05.000 so there's all that stuff also what mook mook look to say you don't need mook um okay maybe
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:12.28 maybe that but you kind of need mook so that seems like that is the greatest name ever mook yes
01:51:12.28 --> 01:51:20.84 I mean it's you know there's this borderline you know like just you know we were talking the other day
01:51:20.84 --> 01:51:29.08 about this borderline genius oh yeah just the worst idea on the planet yeah mook is in the genius
01:51:29.08 --> 01:51:36.84 got to go right you know what I mean I mean it's it's it's genius mook yeah it's uh it's fitting
01:51:36.84 --> 01:51:46.68 and it it is inspired by mook itself yeah mook came first and then mook came you know you
01:51:46.68 --> 01:51:52.52 are in the the drink came yeah and it was so good I remember telling you guys this is not a
01:51:52.52 --> 01:51:58.52 pro this is not a protein just like a protein yeah this isn't a meal replacement right this is
01:51:58.52 --> 01:52:09.88 it's own thing and and it's taste to me like mook I think the influences in there for me
01:52:09.88 --> 01:52:16.28 were the monk fruit yeah right mook mook right and then kind of like Hulk right because I knew
01:52:16.28 --> 01:52:23.000 we're going to mint green and then of course motorhead mook over the oh because that's just legit
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:30.76 yeah and they asked lemme why he put the umla over oh in motorhead and he said because it look cool
01:52:30.76 --> 01:52:34.84 like that was his answer all right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:52:34.84 --> 01:52:39.48 there's the full story on it that's the full story umla umla I thought so it's not an emulet
01:52:40.12 --> 01:52:45.40 is that a different emulet umla umla and emulet is not like somebody where around you're
01:52:45.40 --> 01:52:54.12 yeah like a little thing I thought that those crystals and emulets maybe no umla umla yeah that's
01:52:54.12 --> 01:52:59.40 funny you're like and when you do it put put put the umla above it put the two dots I was like
01:52:59.40 --> 01:53:02.52 I don't know how to put I don't know how to do that on the computer you're like hold down this
01:53:02.52 --> 01:53:11.24 key and press this and it's like mook was born you know mook was born it's gonna be a pretty
01:53:11.24 --> 01:53:18.44 importance part of my texting somebody texting someone I like my phone auto corrects like
01:53:18.44 --> 01:53:24.44 mook to mo oh umla okay all caps that's where the auto corrects you in the right row right
01:53:24.44 --> 01:53:29.32 mook so that's all that extra doesn't do that yeah you can change it and mine also the other
01:53:29.32 --> 01:53:35.72 thing I have when I write jj it turns into jitter so that way I don't type about jitter with a
01:53:35.72 --> 01:53:39.000 hyphen in there every time you know you got to change the keyboard and I tried jj and it says
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000 jjitter gotta be honest I didn't know you could do that yes you can so there's a
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.16 probably the two that you actually need just mook and jjitter because you type mook so off and
01:53:49.16 --> 01:53:54.84 I type jitter so off and because even like responding on Twitter it works so I just said jj
01:53:54.84 --> 01:53:59.24 jj jj it's just so you must get a lot of questions like what do you need to be successful in life
01:53:59.24 --> 01:54:07.72 yeah like mook and jj jj jj it's super easy yeah cool also disciplined by the way
01:54:07.72 --> 01:54:13.16 yeah yeah yeah yeah not say disciplined and I will say that is it cheating that today
01:54:13.16 --> 01:54:19.96 I'm going on how many hours of sleep hmm none yeah not a lot and and I was tired
01:54:19.96 --> 01:54:24.76 coming when I said today I have as all planning I was like okay tonight I'm gonna go to bed early
01:54:24.76 --> 01:54:28.52 oh and I'm gonna sleep and I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna feel great and I said to you
01:54:28.52 --> 01:54:33.56 I'm gonna record tomorrow you're like well tonight in my in my mind I said to myself damn
01:54:33.56 --> 01:54:41.96 that sucks and then you but I would never like reveal that I'm gonna say no I'm kind of tired
01:54:41.96 --> 01:54:49.08 I'm too tired to record a podcast no not that so but I in case you can tell us any
01:54:49.08 --> 01:54:52.36 of those kind of tired coming in and then I drank some of the B
01:54:52.36 --> 01:54:57.48 yeah yeah that's a good chance to say yeah well but yeah the discipline is coming along way
01:54:57.48 --> 01:55:01.96 you know we have the powder of course yeah right and then what pills
01:55:01.96 --> 01:55:09.56 yes powder pills yeah during yeah the discipline goes tonight I wasn't gonna have a go

02:04:47.16 --> 02:04:52.76 told me yeah right out like cool jockel says cool stop I get it but the way I kind of kind of
02:04:52.76 --> 02:04:58.36 distilled it down as far as like the format is if you're seeing something important and it's kind of
02:04:58.36 --> 02:05:04.92 longer than one minute I won't put any explosions on it cool okay under one minute explosions and
02:05:04.92 --> 02:05:12.20 flames by the way we got psychological warfare little moments of weakness that you might experience
02:05:12.20 --> 02:05:18.60 during your day in your brain in your own little brain little debates that are happening the weak
02:05:18.60 --> 02:05:24.04 voice versus the strong voice sometime the weak voice gets stronger and it needs to catch a beat
02:05:24.04 --> 02:05:31.80 down that's when you press play on your iPhone that little psychological warfare track that tells you
02:05:31.80 --> 02:05:39.72 no you're not gonna skip leg day you're gonna go get it psychological warfare that's MP3 iTunes

02:06:38.20 --> 02:06:44.28 that kind of helicopter when you go into it I've been in number four they seem like you remember when
02:06:44.28 --> 02:06:47.80 you built a model when you were kid you did you ever do a build a model when you were kid it was
02:06:47.80 --> 02:06:53.72 little plastic pieces and they stuck them together with test testers glue yeah it seems like
02:06:53.72 --> 02:06:59.80 this is one elevation above that just one it seems like someone made this thing out of little
02:06:59.80 --> 02:07:04.60 right a vector set pieces that's what it seems that's what those helicopters feel like when you get
02:07:04.60 --> 02:07:09.16 in them and when you find them that's what they feel like if you don't like flying you're not going
02:07:09.16 --> 02:07:15.24 to be game for that especially with decoda track I will declare you as the climb plus you weigh
02:07:15.24 --> 02:07:25.40 900 pounds so that would be like flying lopsided people he is a savage and we're actually going to

02:11:50.52 --> 02:11:55.72 increased just until you die not only no just get like I'll have every kettlebell imaginable
02:11:55.72 --> 02:12:00.52 oh yeah I do I have the whole spectrum and yeah but man it's worth it because like you can
02:12:00.52 --> 02:12:04.20 modulate like throughout the whole work out especially if you're doing kettlebells which I highly
02:12:04.20 --> 02:12:10.12 recommend by the way to kettlebells Pete I've just started recently just just like swinging them
02:12:10.12 --> 02:12:14.68 yeah you should be swinging a nice light weight because you got your back situation
02:12:14.68 --> 02:12:20.76 swing a nice light weight and it is so good for you man it feels good you know here's
02:12:20.76 --> 02:12:24.84 thing about kettlebell swings you won't feel this because you're going light but you think to yourself
02:12:24.84 --> 02:12:30.36 oh I got whatever I got my 40 kilogram kettlebell no factor I'll swing this thing you know it's
02:12:30.36 --> 02:12:36.84 going to be pretty easy and the first six of them it is easy you're like what is this yeah this
02:12:36.84 --> 02:12:42.84 by the time you get to 16 you're like okay yep then you get to 24 you're like okay yep
02:12:42.84 --> 02:12:48.76 I see what's going on yeah it's it kicks you yeah kicks you good even on the rolling machine
02:12:48.76 --> 02:12:54.12 you got a different rolling machine but on a concept too my rolling machine when you start you're like
02:12:54.12 --> 02:13:00.12 I'm gonna blast this thing out and it takes a minute for your for your energy system what's
02:13:00.12 --> 02:13:07.40 that first energy system that you're using yeah like the ATP that immediate sprint one
02:13:07.40 --> 02:13:11.000 and you're like using that and but then it gets used up yes you're anaerobic that's
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.48 where your anaerobic system gets used up and then you're just sucking but you think you're
02:13:15.48 --> 02:13:20.36 Superman for the first you know I'm a little belly meters do you usually roll it just depends
02:13:20.36 --> 02:13:25.08 on what I'm doing just depends what I'm doing you know and I use it usually for sprinting I'm
02:13:25.08 --> 02:13:30.04 usually not in there go for 20 minutes I've been doing a little bit when I couldn't run
02:13:30.04 --> 02:13:34.76 because my knee I was rolling a little bit more and I was using minimum I wasn't going
02:13:34.76 --> 02:13:39.40 to full range of motion but anyways so how long you going I go 30 minutes yeah that's cool
02:13:39.40 --> 02:13:43.80 I try to 8000 meters yeah that's great minutes that's just consistent so yeah yeah I
02:13:43.80 --> 02:13:48.60 did I I did one the other night because that the the mountain or treat where you had the
02:13:48.60 --> 02:13:53.000 great workout that was our original factor yeah all the big timbers and stuff of course
02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:58.68 and I uh I've been working out in the evenings and I did one the other night it was like a
02:13:58.68 --> 02:14:04.92 home and I was really late and I just kept all the lights out and I rode in the pitch black could
02:14:04.92 --> 02:14:09.72 you see the monitor or anything no and I just rode until you felt like I rode it and I actually
02:14:09.72 --> 02:14:14.92 rode against my shadow because it was just a little bit of light behind me casting a shadow on
02:14:14.92 --> 02:14:21.72 the wall and I just just like chasing my shadow and it was the best workout I had no idea how long
02:14:21.72 --> 02:14:26.44 I had rode I just knew like 30 minutes I said the timer for in the pitch black and
02:14:27.56 --> 02:14:32.44 it was freaking phenomenal I just like you did set the timer my phone timer yeah and it just went off
02:14:32.44 --> 02:14:38.44 my phone so you had no idea it was just a puddle on it's what I was doing, it's kind of kind of
02:14:38.44 --> 02:14:48.36 spiritual, right? it's exactly how you just like you see what I got some books I got a new book
02:14:48.36 --> 02:14:54.92 Leadership strategy and tactics field manual that is available for pre-order right now.
02:14:55.56 --> 02:15:00.28 If you want to get a first-of-disch, then you shorter right now. If you don't,
02:15:01.08 --> 02:15:04.28 well it doesn't really matter what you do. Is that a hard copy? Oh, yes.
02:15:04.28 --> 02:15:11.80 Oh, yes. It is. Yeah. It's a hard cover book. Yeah. It's not the same size as the original field manual.
02:15:11.80 --> 02:15:16.28 It's smaller so that people can carry it. That's one of the things that when you look to field
02:15:16.28 --> 02:15:22.76 manual like, well, do we want to be able to carry it? I'm like, yeah, probably. This one is to be used
02:15:23.32 --> 02:15:28.68 in the field leadership. What are some of the things that the chapter name? So it's broken down
02:15:28.68 --> 02:15:34.36 like this. There's 80 chapters. Holy shit. Yeah. So there's 80 chapters, but they're short. Got it.
02:15:34.36 --> 02:15:40.92 Heading chapters. Where you go. And it's all about leadership. It's my boss's micro-management. What do I do?
02:15:40.92 --> 02:15:47.24 How would this work for for some of my floor managers? Because they're plugged into the training
02:15:47.24 --> 02:15:51.96 program, the Ashline Front Training Program, the online program, which has been awesome.
02:15:51.96 --> 02:15:58.12 You know, but it would be nice because they can't, they can't like be on that well, they're
02:15:58.12 --> 02:16:02.52 operating. We call them operators, right? Well, they're operating, but if they did have like a book
02:16:02.52 --> 02:16:07.40 that it was like that. That's what it is. That's why I made it. Yeah. And another thing is, I used to
02:16:07.40 --> 02:16:12.92 build a say, if someone said, hey, you know, as far as practical application of these principles,
02:16:12.92 --> 02:16:19.32 you know, what do I do if my, if I got a guy that's, if I got a guy that's got a lot of potential,
02:16:19.32 --> 02:16:22.68 but he's not doing what he should be doing, what should I do? And I used to just be able to say,
02:16:22.68 --> 02:16:27.56 hey, just listen, you know, go listen to podcasts. And when there was 20 podcasts, it's like,
02:16:27.56 --> 02:16:31.80 oh, cool, you know, you listen to the podcast. Now if I tell someone, oh, the answer is in the podcast,
02:16:31.80 --> 02:16:38.84 I'm basically assigning them over 500 hours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. It's inappropriate, right?
02:16:38.84 --> 02:16:42.44 So I had to take all this information and like distill it down. So you can say,
02:16:42.44 --> 02:16:47.72 you just look it up. It's highly indexed. Okay. So you can just look up. That's cool. The subject
02:16:47.72 --> 02:16:55.96 and boom go. So totally pragmatic. So would, if for, for like our, our managers, our floor managers,
02:16:55.96 --> 02:17:03.80 would you say that the book replaces the online training or they serve two different purposes?
02:17:03.80 --> 02:17:11.000 They serve two different purposes. Here's the facts. You, you, you want to, you don't get good at
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.20 anything through one direction of training. How much better you, how much better you at, how
02:17:16.20 --> 02:17:20.60 much better you at an arm lock if you learn it from four different instructors? Oh, yeah, you're,
02:17:20.60 --> 02:17:27.80 your life better. How much better are you at any learning a subject if you learn three books
02:17:27.80 --> 02:17:32.60 about a subject instead of one? Oh, yeah. infinitely better. It's not just better. It's,
02:17:32.60 --> 02:17:37.88 it's exponentially better because you're able to compare and contrast what you learn the first time
02:17:37.88 --> 02:17:42.12 with what you learn in the second time. You see it from another angle. So you see it one dimensional.
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.000 You see it two dimensional on the third time you read a book about the same subject. You see it
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.64 for the third dimension. The fourth time now you're seeing the fourth dimension of things and that
02:17:51.64 --> 02:17:58.28 continues to go. So all these things. So they need both. All these things are an effort to give the
02:17:58.28 --> 02:18:05.08 different perspectives and different angles on these subjects because the better you get it them,
02:18:05.08 --> 02:18:10.92 just like training you to. If, if you, the more you, the more time you spend on bottom and
02:18:10.92 --> 02:18:15.64 inside control, the better you get it handling it. The more time you spend dealing with different
02:18:15.64 --> 02:18:19.40 leadership problems, the better you get at it. The more different angles you can see, the better you
02:18:19.40 --> 02:18:25.40 get at it. So that's the purpose. But I would say the initial ideal is like listen, people need to
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:29.16 be able to apply these principles. They need, because here's another thing people read,
02:18:29.16 --> 02:18:33.88 extreme ownership. They, they actually understand the principles. They can explain the principles
02:18:33.88 --> 02:18:40.76 back to you. But as far as overlaying those principles and even overlaying the examples onto what
02:18:40.76 --> 02:18:47.96 they're dealing with, sometimes people, sometimes some people have a hard time making those things
02:18:47.96 --> 02:18:53.80 overlay properly. And so here it is. Instead of saying here's the principle overlay it on your
02:18:53.80 --> 02:18:59.000 thing. It's like here's what it will look like right now when you put it there. It's more, it's more
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:06.92 direct. You don't have to, you can do less. You can, you can, you can, it's just more direct.
02:19:06.92 --> 02:19:15.48 So that's the leadership strategy and tactics field manual. I did just get a note from my publisher
02:19:15.48 --> 02:19:22.52 and they said this was superb. Super superb. And you know that's pretty cool. You get, you know,
02:19:22.52 --> 02:19:26.92 when you bring a bunch of books into this book is superb. That's, especially from a publisher
02:19:26.92 --> 02:19:31.72 that reads books all the time. And they don't have to send you that note. Like this is from someone
02:19:31.72 --> 02:19:35.96 at the publishing company that doesn't, doesn't just send out notes, right? So it's pretty
02:19:35.96 --> 02:19:40.04 cool. So they probably read it and are applying the strategies. Yeah. Yeah. They're probably like,
02:19:40.04 --> 02:19:45.72 okay, I'm going to use this now. Yeah. Totally. Also, way the Warrior Kid 3, where there's a will,
02:19:46.60 --> 02:19:52.12 you can get that right now, way the Warrior Kid 1, Mark's mission. How many people at Camp? How many
02:19:52.12 --> 02:19:56.76 books, how many Warrior Kid books have you seen? He signed at Camp all over. Yeah, all of them. There's
02:19:56.76 --> 02:20:01.08 people after people, after people, after people, those books are having such an incredible impact.
02:20:01.08 --> 02:20:07.32 It's so amazing to see, I don't think there's anything that makes me feel better at this point
02:20:07.32 --> 02:20:14.60 in my life than getting, showing us a parent, showing me a video of a little kid doing a pull-up
02:20:14.60 --> 02:20:18.12 and then looking at the camera and saying, I'm a Warrior Kid. Yeah. That's badass. Just doesn't
02:20:18.12 --> 02:20:22.60 get any better than that. I've been signing more kid books too. By the way, that's awesome. I didn't
02:20:22.60 --> 02:20:27.08 write it by the way, man. I signed a few. That's awesome. I took the picture in the back that's
02:20:27.08 --> 02:20:31.32 something. Got a manual. Confusion. Got to make a movie. We're working it. We're working it now.
02:20:32.36 --> 02:20:35.64 Yep. And then this moment was Freedom Field Manual. That's another Field Manual. That's
02:20:35.64 --> 02:20:43.88 one's directed at you individually. How to get after it. The audio version is on MP3. It's not
02:20:43.88 --> 02:20:50.84 unautable. Extreme ownership and dichotomy leadership. The first two books where you learn the principles.
02:20:51.08 --> 02:20:55.88 You have to know the principles. If you don't know the principles, applying them doesn't make any
02:20:55.88 --> 02:21:01.88 sense to you. So, extreme ownership and dichotomy leadership get these principles into your head
02:21:01.88 --> 02:21:09.24 so that you can apply them at your business, at your life. They work. They work. That's another
02:21:09.24 --> 02:21:15.08 thing I hear all the time from people. They say, you know, I've been using it works. It works.
02:21:15.08 --> 02:21:20.28 I'll give me specific examples of how it works. I had this customer call me and they said,
02:21:20.28 --> 02:21:23.88 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, you know what? That's my fault. And they said,
02:21:23.88 --> 02:21:29.48 you know what? I probably should have given you a better heads up. It works. It works.
02:21:31.24 --> 02:21:36.92 We got our leadership consultancy. We're just called echelon front, go to echelon front.com.
02:21:36.92 --> 02:21:45.56 If you have problems in your organization of any kind of any kind, they are leadership problems
02:21:46.44 --> 02:21:52.04 and you need to help get your leadership squared away and the line and that is what we do at echelon
02:21:52.04 --> 02:21:59.72 front. echelon front.com. We got EF online. Do you go? Do you share the size of clients you work
02:21:59.72 --> 02:22:06.60 with? Like, do you let people know like, you guys are on the road? Or I should say around the world
02:22:06.60 --> 02:22:12.92 all the time helping companies become better leaders, big companies. Like sometimes we're going
02:22:12.92 --> 02:22:17.08 on the phone, you're like, oh, I'm here. So, then I say, like, oh, I'm here. Like, do people actually
02:22:17.08 --> 02:22:23.80 understand the impact you're just having on leadership in corporate America as a whole? Maybe I
02:22:23.80 --> 02:22:29.64 don't do a great job of explaining that. We work with the largest companies in the world.
02:22:30.28 --> 02:22:37.88 And we also work with smaller companies as well. And if you're so small that it's out of the price
02:22:37.88 --> 02:22:42.52 range for you as a company, guess what? We got something called the master. You can sign up and
02:22:42.52 --> 02:22:46.36 come to one of our masters where we teach these principles. You can bring three, four people in your
02:22:46.36 --> 02:22:50.92 leadership team. If you've got a company of, you know, 20 people, you can bring three, four of
02:22:50.92 --> 02:22:55.16 your leaders and you kind of get that initiated. And then you can use something called the F online,
02:22:55.16 --> 02:23:01.24 which you are using. Yeah, we use it. Yeah, and my, you know, and it's nice because before,
02:23:01.24 --> 02:23:06.84 like, it's always come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, you know, and helping
02:23:06.84 --> 02:23:11.88 helping our our leaders, which is basically everybody in the factory, become better leaders.
02:23:11.88 --> 02:23:17.96 And to learn leadership principles. But now they can go online and then they come to me with
02:23:17.96 --> 02:23:23.72 questions that have, right? So it's honestly it doesn't take as much time. We're sure wonderful.
02:23:23.72 --> 02:23:28.60 So the efficiencies are going up. You know what I did at first? They were, you know, a few
02:23:28.60 --> 02:23:32.92 Jill, the one that's stitching here in Jan. And a few others are like, when can we start? Can we
02:23:32.92 --> 02:23:37.72 do this on company time? That was the first question. Can we, and of course, we don't have
02:23:37.72 --> 02:23:43.80 computers set up in everything. And I was like, yes, yes, you can. Because I wanted them to know
02:23:43.80 --> 02:23:49.56 that I'm invested in this. For sure. And once I, and so I was using the leadership techniques
02:23:50.20 --> 02:23:55.64 to teach leadership. Yes. And then once they saw that I was in, then they went home and then they
02:23:55.64 --> 02:23:59.64 got online. Yeah. And I was like, now they're doing it on their own time. Because I was invested
02:23:59.64 --> 02:24:04.12 in them doing it on this, on our time. Of course, on company you want that. You think of the
02:24:04.12 --> 02:24:11.88 cost benefit and the ROI we get at origin, you get at origin because of the leadership.
02:24:11.88 --> 02:24:16.60 Yep. It's just the way it is. Yep. Yep. Absolutely. It's good. Awesome. Awesome stuff.
02:24:18.20 --> 02:24:26.28 What else we got? We got. So yeah, if you can't come to, if you can't, if you can't hire
02:24:26.28 --> 02:24:30.04 us on front, go to the master. The next one is taking place December 4th and 5th and Sidney.
02:24:30.04 --> 02:24:35.56 We're about to release the follow on dates for 2020 as soon as we can. The thing is, here's the deal.
02:24:35.56 --> 02:24:41.40 They all sell out. They all sell out 100%. And it's not like, hey, it's sold out, but we can fit in
02:24:41.40 --> 02:24:47.80 eight more people. No, it's sold out and we no one else will be coming. So when I hear a crazy statistic,
02:24:47.80 --> 02:24:54.36 yes, somebody said to me today, they know how many Americans are us like as 300 million Americans.
02:24:54.36 --> 02:25:00.20 They're like, how many people are at this immersion camp? And I said, well, 300 per session. He's
02:25:00.20 --> 02:25:06.20 like so one in a million. And I said, yeah, and we had the registration off three months early.
02:25:06.20 --> 02:25:11.96 How many people do you let into the master? It looks like it depends on the size of the venue,
02:25:11.96 --> 02:25:18.28 but it's anywhere between 700 and 850. But the Australia one, we have less. We have a smaller
02:25:18.28 --> 02:25:22.76 venue. We just couldn't get the size of venue that we need. So we have less. But so two in a
02:25:22.76 --> 02:25:28.68 million, you're letting something like that. You know what I mean? It's, yeah, it's a solid value.
02:25:28.68 --> 02:25:34.36 Add it is ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah. So come and check out the master. And then, of course, we have
02:25:35.24 --> 02:25:40.44 EF Overwatch, which we are, I had to talk about on this podcast, taking people that have experience
02:25:40.44 --> 02:25:45.32 in leadership and putting them into companies in a civilian sector. So if you're a company that needs
02:25:45.32 --> 02:25:51.80 leadership or you're a leader that needs to move on to your next mission in life, go to EF Overwatch.com.
02:25:53.08 --> 02:26:00.04 And if you haven't heard enough of us, if you haven't heard enough stories about Jiu Jitsu,
02:26:01.48 --> 02:26:08.44 shoes, jeans, whatever else you can find us on the in-or-webs. We're on Twitter, one on its
02:26:08.44 --> 02:26:19.24 screen. We're on Dine Fusionbock. Oh, Facebook, oh, I have a question. It's like, it's a
02:26:19.24 --> 02:26:22.52 voice. You look real concerned. You're like, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are we
02:26:22.52 --> 02:26:26.52 up? I thought I was Facebook. Yeah, he was. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
02:26:26.52 --> 02:26:32.92 I know what it was. It's hot. Pete is on Instagram. He's at, I was forced to go on Instagram.
02:26:32.92 --> 02:26:37.48 But now that's your primary. Well, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah, I'm not, I'm what I mean,
02:26:37.48 --> 02:26:41.32 I promise. Well, that's what you seem to do your most activity on. You think?
