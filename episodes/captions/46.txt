[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 46 with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:06] Jocco Willick. Good evening echo. Good evening.
[00:00:14] There is a little survival instinct.
[00:00:22] It's very subtle.
[00:00:25] But I would notice it sometimes in a combat situation.
[00:00:34] When guys are thinking that enemy fire at any time could open up and kill them,
[00:00:44] you'd see some guys subconsciously.
[00:00:48] They just, they just try and make themselves a little bit of a smaller target.
[00:00:54] They just kind of slouch their backs down a little bit and they just kind of bow their head just a tad.
[00:01:04] It's not a bad thing to do.
[00:01:06] I don't think guys actually think about it. I don't think they consciously do it.
[00:01:12] I think it just kind of happens.
[00:01:16] It can happen when you think you could get shot at any moment.
[00:01:20] It's likely a good instinct to have.
[00:01:30] And when we first got to Ramadi, we were out on patrol and I saw one of my guys
[00:01:39] on a real patrol. My first time seeing this particular guy on a real patrol.
[00:01:44] And it was in the Malab district of Ramadi, which was just an enemy controlled,
[00:01:53] cesspool of violence with threats everywhere.
[00:02:00] And as I saw this guy, he was standing straight up.
[00:02:10] Just standing straight up as head was held high.
[00:02:14] As a weapon was at the ready, he was scanning.
[00:02:20] He was hunting.
[00:02:23] There was no slouching his back. There was no lowering of his head. There was no fear
[00:02:30] a parent on his face or in his posture. He was just boldly facing the threat.
[00:02:36] Standing tall.
[00:02:44] Now you've heard me talk about some of my guys in tasking at Bruser
[00:02:54] that I worried about.
[00:02:57] I just some of the guys that I thought that they basically had too much courage,
[00:03:05] too much bravery. And it just didn't seem like that kind of attitude
[00:03:14] was survivable day after day after day after bloody day in Ramadi.
[00:03:23] But somehow some way through some divine providence, this particular brave soul did survive,
[00:03:38] and actually thrived in that environment, in the battle of Ramadi with tasking at Bruser.
[00:03:46] Now tasking at Bruser was made up of two seal potoons, Charlie Potoon and Delta Potoon.
[00:03:54] Charlie Potoon we've talked about before.
[00:03:57] Lave Fabon was the Potoon commander, Tony Afradi, who's been on the podcast.
[00:04:03] BTF Tony, he was the Potoon chief and the lead sniper for Charlie Potoon was Chris Kyle.
[00:04:10] And in the other Potoon, Delta Potoon, where Andrew Paul, who's also been on the podcast,
[00:04:21] he was the assistant Potoon commander and the point man and sniper, the lead point man and lead
[00:04:30] sniper for Delta Potoon was that guy was the guy that I just described walking through the literal
[00:04:39] valley of death with his head held high.
[00:04:51] And his name is Jeremiah De Nell, also known as JP De Nell. That's what I always called him.
[00:05:01] And we have him as a guest on the podcast tonight. Now,
[00:05:05] when JP was in tasking at Bruser, he was a kid. When we were in work up, I think he was 22 years old.
[00:05:16] When we deployed he was 23 years old and I love JP. He was like a brother and to be quite honest,
[00:05:25] really he's like a little brother to me. And I loved his aggressiveness and when we were going through
[00:05:33] work up, he would just just straight up execute anything I told him to do. Anything.
[00:05:40] Like a like a hyper aggressive Terminator robot. I would look at him and say, JP take that room or
[00:05:46] JP get on that high ground or JP get those prisoners out of here and he would just get after it
[00:05:50] and make it happen and just destroy or outmaneuver anything that was in his way.
[00:05:57] One time we were going through Mount Training, which is urban warfare. So we're in a kind of
[00:06:03] fake city with buildings and all this and there was a building across the street and we were taking
[00:06:08] massive paintball fire again. It's just training but we're getting shot up with paintball.
[00:06:14] And in my mind I'm thinking, okay, where if this is real we're getting killed.
[00:06:18] And I know that we need to get aggressive to stop this and say, I'm kind of give the command of,
[00:06:22] hey, we need to hit that building across the street and it like as the last word is coming out of
[00:06:25] my mouth. I see JP just bust out of the door the building we're in.
[00:06:29] Just go running across the street with his gun blazing. Just caveman smashed through the door
[00:06:36] of the target building. Do you go in there and I just see muzzle flashes. He's just machine gunning people.
[00:06:43] And I thought to myself, okay, JP can bring it at least he can bring it during training
[00:06:53] because courage against paintball in training is actually not that big of a deal at all. In fact,
[00:07:03] it's borderline meaningless but it is an indication.
[00:07:10] Now courage in sustained combat is another thing.
[00:07:15] And JP proved himself as a true warrior over and over and over again during the battle
[00:07:26] of Ramadi. And I'm honored to have my brother JP to know on the podcast today.
[00:07:35] JP, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me here. And we have to start with trying to understand
[00:07:50] where you come from. How much time do we have? Where you grew up and in all that.
[00:07:58] And it's pretty cool. I know your mom and dad and I've actually grappled against your dad.
[00:08:08] 20 of his highlights. He loves that. He talks about it all the time. He has a long, strong,
[00:08:13] man, scary strong. Yeah. Like, and how old is he now? He is 54, 55. No kidding. Yeah.
[00:08:24] So 10 years ago, he was my age. Yeah. So when I grappled with him, he was my age. Yeah.
[00:08:29] And I thought he was all old. No. And right now, if you called me old, I'd be pissed. Yeah, I know you would be.
[00:08:35] So Mr. Vanilla, I apologize. I thought you were old back in the day. No. He grabbed the
[00:08:39] hold of my head and you were a must. I am right now. Oh, that's crazy, isn't it? Yeah. Sorry.
[00:08:45] Yeah, no, that's true. So tell us about where you come from. What was like growing up?
[00:08:52] All that stuff. How did my parents are awesome? Very hard workers.
[00:08:59] You grew up tied on money. My dad did construction and framing in the 80s and my mom taught
[00:09:06] step aerobics not a lot of money there. But they constantly worked for our family. It was awesome.
[00:09:14] Now we, every Sunday we were at church, you know, not having a lot of money. You go out and do stuff.
[00:09:20] We'd go for, for drives. You know, that's what we did. Our family would go for drives. And just go,
[00:09:25] you know, see the, you know, we're in Northern California, Sacramento within 20 minutes.
[00:09:29] He can be in the foot hills and it's just beautiful. We go to my grandparents' property.
[00:09:34] You know, my dad's parents were a very big part of our life as well. Growing up,
[00:09:39] grandfather's old world, or two of that was on the destroyer. On a destroyer, my grandmother's
[00:09:46] amazing woman, you know, wakes up every morning, still at 5 a.m. to pray for everybody in the family.
[00:09:52] They have five acres up in the foot hills, the pasture, the horses. So for kids, there's awesome.
[00:09:58] You know, brother and sister. My parents, you know, they didn't wait for having kids, you know,
[00:10:03] I had me and then, you know, I think it was like 15 or now 17 months later. My brother comes
[00:10:09] then 17 months later, I thought my sister comes. So, you know, our dad and you know, I've
[00:10:14] kept the rich twins. They call that. Yeah. It was like boom, boom, boom.
[00:10:20] Yeah, awesome. You know, my brother and my sister, like two of my closest best friends, still, you know,
[00:10:26] we just always used to grow up playing Navy Seals, you know, and, you know, where'd you get
[00:10:32] okay, so going into the next question, which, which I am always curious is, how did you hear about
[00:10:38] the teams? Actually, my brother saw something on TV. There's some special about the forming of the
[00:10:47] seals and the, you know, JFK's speech and all this stuff, and he had my parents record it.
[00:10:53] And we would watch that every morning that we could, you know, we're young, you know, trying to
[00:10:59] go to school with my brother's popnet and the VCR. And so every weekend, we definitely watched it,
[00:11:05] and then we would, you know, dress up in camis and pan our faces and stuff that we got from
[00:11:10] old Army Navy surplus store or just from garage sales and we would go play Navy Seals, you know,
[00:11:16] and we got to my grandparents as like a haven, you know, and it's funny. Now, like, I didn't know
[00:11:22] what I was doing, but I used to like do make up little guilly suits. And I would have my parents
[00:11:28] dropped me off at the front entrance of my grandparents property. I'd wait until I got up to the
[00:11:32] house and I'd say, hey, I want, I want to see if you can see me sneaking up there. I would try to
[00:11:36] stock up to my grandparents house. You're training this. I mean, yeah. And yeah, so that, you know,
[00:11:43] it was a really good life. You know, all my, all my aunts and uncles and cousins, you know,
[00:11:47] we're all really close and just really close family, you know, my uncle, my cousin's uncles,
[00:11:54] he was a cop, back where we grew up and, you know, he's still serving the community. He's a
[00:11:59] legit badass. And, you know, so I was surrounded by a lot of good people that didn't know anything
[00:12:05] other than working hard. Like you just have to work hard. There's no excuses for that. There's no handouts,
[00:12:10] like you've just got to get after it. And that's just kind of how I learned about the teams. And,
[00:12:16] you know, as you get older in high school, you kind of forget about that stuff. But yeah, it was
[00:12:20] pretty good solid based. Great life. Did you win list right out of high school? Yeah. Yeah, I was in,
[00:12:25] um, missing year of high school. Uh, weren't you breaking leg or have some weirds?
[00:12:30] I had my, I broke my hand. Broken hand. Yeah, so my hand was in a cast. How'd you do that?
[00:12:37] Well, I had to get to get to the best thing that you do. You sold this story of this kind of, uh,
[00:12:44] you know, picture perfect childhood with all this goodness around you. But just,
[00:12:51] I'll just going to straight up tell people. JP might crack a few people once in a while if they
[00:12:55] need it. What he was a young kid. Yeah. Definitely definitely never went out looking for it and
[00:13:00] starting it. But if it was there, I, you know, like, anyways, we're at a party with my buddies. And,
[00:13:07] no, actually, we're just like kind of hanging out the house and, I don't know,
[00:13:10] I happen some guys like show it up the orange. Anyway, it's gotten a fight, broke my hand. Um,
[00:13:15] don't, you know, like a smart young man. Don't go to the hospital that night. My hands like
[00:13:20] ballooning up. Well, you know, the next day we're going to go whitewater rafting. So I mean,
[00:13:25] I can't not do that with all my friends. So I just put my hand in the river the whole time.
[00:13:30] Because I'm like, that's like ice right? I get home. I thought my mom was going to just beat me.
[00:13:35] She's a short little, just thin athletic woman. And I was just like terrified of the
[00:13:41] fridge. She's going to do some step aerobics on your head. Yes. Exactly. She was going to get after it.
[00:13:46] Um, and so I go, you know, so she's like, yeah, we're going to the hospital. So we go there and they're like,
[00:13:52] yeah, you broke her knuckle, this bone, and fractured the wrist. I'm like, okay. So I get in a cast.
[00:13:59] Of course, my dad's pissed off, you know, and, um, he's just like, you know, just,
[00:14:05] he's my senior year. I'm getting close to graduation. And there was no talk of college.
[00:14:10] I played water polo. My senior year in one of the J.C.s or my coach at, hey,
[00:14:15] you know, if you go to this J.C., you see Davis, you know, you could be going over and playing over there.
[00:14:20] I just knew college wasn't what I wanted to do. At the time, it just wasn't for me. I wasn't going to waste time
[00:14:25] more money doing something I just wasn't driven to do. And, um, you know, my dad's like, what are you going to do?
[00:14:31] What are you going to do with your life? And I was like, I don't know, probably be a white water rafting guy
[00:14:35] and live up up in the mountains. He's like, what are you going to do with your life? You're like,
[00:14:39] not there on with that, but you know, he's like, no, like, you're, no. And, uh, because one of my best friends
[00:14:46] did that, and, uh, which is just cool, which is a lifestyle, but it seems cool, yeah, it would be great for the
[00:14:51] soul, right? And, um, so anyways, my dad was like, what about the military? Like, what about being a Navy
[00:14:56] seal? You always talk about it. And, at the time, all I could think about was just like the regular
[00:15:02] fleet Navy recruiters that would come to high school. And this was pre 9-11, so nobody's really
[00:15:06] very motivated. And, you know, they, they would come to the high school, but they never really
[00:15:10] engaged with the students or anything. So I was like, uh, that's the Navy. I don't know.
[00:15:17] I'll go to work that next day, and because I'm in a cast, I had me at the front register.
[00:15:23] And for the first time ever, I noticed across the street is a Navy recruiting office.
[00:15:28] I was like, oh, I'll go in there. So I went in there and of course, I was like, oh, what are you
[00:15:31] going to do with a while? What are you here for? I was like, I was thinking about joining the Navy,
[00:15:35] you want to be a Navy seal? They all start laughing. I was like, check. I would pass. Like, I was like,
[00:15:41] real mad. I thought, well, you know, all the seal wannabes have to talk to pedda after so and so.
[00:15:47] And, yeah, do you mean you said the seal wannabes? I was fired up. And then you guys,
[00:15:52] and we can't do anything with your cast on. Am I right? Roger that. They're like, you know, if you
[00:15:56] want to come talk to them, he'll be on Thursday, he'll be on Tuesday. He'll be on Tuesday.
[00:16:00] Okay. So I go, go back to work. I'm just staring at the Navy recruiting office a whole time. Just
[00:16:06] just doing. So I'm like, I'm in good shape. You know, like I'm very good athlete. Like, I can do this.
[00:16:12] Go back home and tell my dad my dad's okay. How's work? I'm like, good. I was like, I'm joined the Navy.
[00:16:19] And I can't go do anything for boot camp with this cast on. Like, I don't know, like, you know,
[00:16:24] my mind, I'm like, I'm leaving for boot camp tomorrow. So I'm like that, right? And so he's like,
[00:16:28] cool, go start the bathtub. Start soaking it. I'll get some tools out of the garage.
[00:16:31] And so my dad comes in there and he has like some like sheet metal shears and something
[00:16:38] out, a saws off. Yeah. And we just got out there and we cut off my cast. Dude, I thought my mom
[00:16:44] was going to beat my dad. Like, she was like, what? Of course, I was like, yeah, I'm joined the Navy.
[00:16:49] I'm going to go be a Navy seal. So I'll sudden I cut off my cast and now her baby boy is leaving to,
[00:16:54] you know, go join the military and she's my poor mom. You know, and so I go back on Thursday. I walk
[00:17:01] in. They look at me. They look at my cast not being there. They're like, you need to talk to
[00:17:05] petty officer's son. So, like, all right, Roger that. And so I just started the rest of the process.
[00:17:10] And, you know, a lot of rehab, my parents had a cafe. They sold that. So,
[00:17:18] maybe my dad could do construction together to spend as much time together as possible.
[00:17:22] And my mom was able to spend time with her mom that was passing away. And that's how I rehabed my hand.
[00:17:27] And my dad would actually wrap my hand up in some of my old kickboxing raps and boxing raps.
[00:17:33] Tape it up. And then we would tape the hammer to my hand. I couldn't grip it.
[00:17:37] I like I could not grip anything. And, you know, that's why he did. Because I see my old
[00:17:40] bag go to work with a cast on and he would have to tape tools to his cast to work.
[00:17:45] I mean, your dad's not the kind of guy that's going to let broken limbs stop him from getting a good
[00:17:51] day's work and just tape that tool to your body and make something happen.
[00:17:55] So, that's what he did with me. And it was awesome. And he knew, like, I wanted to go to
[00:18:00] buds and I was going to go to buds. And so, he would push me to my absolute limit every day at work.
[00:18:06] Like, I mean, every day meant, I mean, I would be pissed sometimes borderline crimes. I
[00:18:11] so mad, not like tears of like, you know, pain or whatever. I was so mad at him. And he'd see it.
[00:18:16] And he'd throw it back a little bit and he'd make, you know, some days like, I'd come in
[00:18:21] to work on over sometimes. And he would be like, hey, I need to go read a 90 pound jack hammer.
[00:18:27] There was no need for a 90 pound jack hammer. Yes, there is. He's a jack hammer. You're brain.
[00:18:32] That's exactly it. And so for eight hours, I would be jack hammering concrete with a 90 pound jack
[00:18:38] hammer while he was doing what he's doing. And then, I mean, it was awesome, though. I mean, he
[00:18:43] would push me to the absolute limit in my mom and him. Or awesome, with communications and helping
[00:18:49] me out with stuff. And it was good. And so then I went, I left September 5, 2001.
[00:18:55] Had a seal contract. I was in buds. I was in boot camp when 9-11 happened. And, you know,
[00:19:01] it was just weird. I was so pissed. Did they tell you guys about it? Yeah, we were all locked down.
[00:19:07] And they were like, hey, the nation's been attacked. You need to get us more info and we're like.
[00:19:12] What? Of course, you have all the week-minded people in there that start crying. Like, I'm 18, right?
[00:19:18] Like, barely 18. And there's just grown men crying. I didn't show it up for this. I'm like,
[00:19:25] I'm getting fired up, like, you need to shut up. So down, like, I'm just like,
[00:19:28] he's looking for a battle accident at this point. Yeah, I'm like, how do I go to bud right now? Do I have
[00:19:33] to finish boot camp? Can I just go, you know? But yeah, so I was in boot camp when I leveled up.
[00:19:37] And then I always felt like, I didn't feel like I knew that being a Navy SEAL is what I needed to do.
[00:19:44] What I wanted to do is what God wanted me to do. And just everything just fell into place.
[00:19:49] You know, it was pretty awesome. So then you go to buds. You went to buds right around the same
[00:19:56] time as late for an Andrew Paul. I was one class behind them. They were class 241. I was class 242.
[00:20:01] And then you, but you ended up in SQT with those guys. Yeah. Yeah. All this is, which is the,
[00:20:07] which is like the training after you get through the basics, seal training buds, which is where
[00:20:12] you do pushups and all that stuff and do pull ups and you have a boat on your head and all that
[00:20:17] stuff and bunch of people quit. Then you go to something a little bit more advanced.
[00:20:20] Called SQT where you actually learned some SEAL skills. Yeah. And then you check into a team.
[00:20:26] And then you get, so you check into team three. Yep. Check into team three. And knock out your first
[00:20:32] between as a new guy. What was that like? It was, it was good. It was cool. You know, I checked into
[00:20:37] team three and you know, it was like, okay, we need some volunteers. We're going to a driving school.
[00:20:42] It's an off-road, hummer racing and navigation school. I was like, how do I get my hand up fast enough
[00:20:47] for that? And it's just worked out great. Like I literally checked into the team. The team's ridiculous.
[00:20:53] It is. I mean, you're 18 years old. Either like everyone said you'd off-road racing school
[00:20:59] for free or you'd bunch of money to go there by the way. So you can buy good meals. Yeah. You're going to go
[00:21:03] for a month. Two weeks straight is going to be off-road driving racing and two weeks going to be
[00:21:07] navigation. I was like, I literally just, yeah, I just come back from Kodiak Alaskan. We were doing
[00:21:13] our cold weather training. So I was up there. I was gone for a month, come back,
[00:21:16] legitimately for a couple of days. And you know, I grow from other times, I call you back. I'm so happy.
[00:21:23] And then I'll say, I was like, I'm waving tomorrow. And I mean, I was just like, I was just happy.
[00:21:29] You know, I was like, yes, this is awesome. This is legit. I'm in the teams. Like I'm getting to do stuff.
[00:21:34] You know, and I went out there. There was a freaking war going on. Yeah. I just wanted to be
[00:21:40] as well equipped as possible. And one of my good-brows, Derek Benson, he was killed on
[00:21:47] extortion 17. He's from Northern California as well. And he was one of both class ahead of me.
[00:21:53] So he had checked in the team of a team three prior to me. We both went to that driving school together.
[00:21:58] And that's where we just became like best friends. You know, so it was awesome. It was a good time
[00:22:03] out there. You know, learned a lot. And you know, there's an older team guys out there too. You know,
[00:22:08] that I got actually interact with. And you know, just guys not from my platoon. So they weren't so hard
[00:22:14] on me because I was a new guy for the same time. Like I was just learning the balance of the teams.
[00:22:19] Because I'm overly nice and social. And I like to talk to everybody and be everybody's friend.
[00:22:25] And when you're a new guy in the sealed teams, that's usually not the best thing. When you're like,
[00:22:29] hey, how are you doing? Buddy? You know, they're like shut up. Like, or like, why are you talking to
[00:22:34] me? And I'm like, because we're going to be friends. Like, we're going to war together. Let's be friends.
[00:22:39] You know, so, you know, but it was cool. You know, and then, um, come back and, um, then all of a sudden,
[00:22:47] we're headed out on our first trip. And we're headed out to Shaws to do shooting school. And, um,
[00:22:52] I mean, we're getting ready to fly out there. And I just see the big huge native American dude.
[00:22:57] I'm like, I hope he's in my platoon. You know, I mean, I'm just like, you're drawn to like just
[00:23:03] awesome warrior looking guys, right? And he's just very stoic and just so I was like, dude, I really
[00:23:09] hope he's in my platoon. And he was, it's my boy Steve Chiro. You know, he lives out in Vegas. And, um,
[00:23:15] you know, he's, he's, he's an awesome old guy to have in the platoon. You know, and then
[00:23:19] rest of the other guys in the platoon, um, you know, they're still active. Dude, he's like, I'm not going
[00:23:24] to drop their names. Um, you know, my boy Pepper, this is Nick name. He was like the perfect old guy to have.
[00:23:31] Because he was so hard on you. Like, you were just waiting for him to whip your ass. But he also
[00:23:37] mentored and guided you. And actually taught you stuff, you know, and it wasn't just, I'm not
[00:23:42] hammering you because you're a new guy. He's like, I'm a hammering you because you're a new guy. But
[00:23:45] show you what you need to be doing and why what you did was wrong. Um, so I was fired up, super
[00:23:52] fired up. So we go out to the chas, you know, your first trip super overwhelming. You know,
[00:23:58] your soul and nervous said it isn't they even told us, okay, this is usually a trip where you
[00:24:02] want it to be halfway or towards the end so you can get a solid grass from what you're doing and
[00:24:06] grow. Um, but we got after it was awesome. Like I said, although, you know, the older guys, um,
[00:24:11] we're solid, uh, we had a really weak LPO and, um, he actually got fired on that trip. So I was a little
[00:24:18] just, you know, concerning to me at first, Mike. Okay. That's for the LPO. And then he's a complete
[00:24:24] third. That's one of the, uh, myths of definitely of the seal teams is when you come in and you think
[00:24:33] every guy is a hard combat warrior and then you get in and you look at some guys and you go wait a second.
[00:24:40] That's not that's not who that's not who I was thinking I was going to be working with. Yeah.
[00:24:44] And of course on the other end of the spectrum, you meet guys where like I want to be like that guy.
[00:24:48] So so you guys, you guys wrap through that work up and go in your first deployment. How is that
[00:24:53] first deployment of you, which I wrapped in your first deployment, right? Um, yeah. Well, for the second
[00:24:57] hour, first half went to Gwam, which was just heartening. You know, Mike too. It was a war going on.
[00:25:04] Let's go to war. How cool you're going to go to Gwam. But, you know, it's part of the, you know,
[00:25:08] it's just part of the, you know, part of the mission. Part of the mission. One of the, you know,
[00:25:12] yeah, again, military people deploy all over the world all the time to maintain stability
[00:25:17] in that includes all units of the military, even special operations. So seals. Sometimes you get
[00:25:24] deployed to places where there's no, you know, really visible threat. Yeah. And it's not what seals
[00:25:32] generally want to do. Yeah. So we did training, we crossed trainers, couple different countries.
[00:25:37] You know, some other pertinent went to the PI, we were in Gwam. You know, we went to Thailand to work
[00:25:43] with the Thai seals for nine days and I mean, it was cool getting to see how other countries do stuff.
[00:25:48] And now that I look back at it, it did give me a much bigger picture, you know, overview of
[00:25:54] stuff. But at the time, like, I'm not even 21, like I just want to get after it, you know, and
[00:26:01] uh, I didn't, uh, for the first half, but then we ripped and we got our act. I'm like, yes, going
[00:26:06] our act. Well, I knew what we were headed over there to do. I was hoping there would be, you know,
[00:26:11] they'd be able to do a lot of different stuff and in up doing personal security, um, for some higher
[00:26:17] dignitaries over there during the elections. And I mean, it was cool. You know, what you're looking
[00:26:21] back now, you look at what you did and you put that on your resume, people like, what, wow, you did that.
[00:26:25] I'm, to me, I was thinking, you know, it sucked, you know, but it didn't. It was also very,
[00:26:30] it was a very good learning experience. Um, and it was part of the mission. In the problem is,
[00:26:36] when they had a gap in that protection, you know, some team guys came to do it and team guys
[00:26:43] do what they do and they just knocked it out of the park. So I guess what? Team guys now have the
[00:26:47] mission for that. And um, but it was cool. You know, we worked with, uh, some different units, some
[00:26:52] Marines and Army guys and they were phenomenal over there as well. And I was, it was awesome to
[00:26:57] learn from them. You know, guys I've been on there, you know, a couple deployments already and the
[00:27:01] wars hasn't really really kicked off and um, that was good. Um, yeah, or, and then our chief got fired.
[00:27:08] It was just like, chiefies. Um, but I had shared with saw like our OIC, AYC, who became our
[00:27:17] the Delta Bulltune Commander, saw the dudes, you know, and so we just had to weed out some of the
[00:27:24] E-coins right on. And that's the nature of that mission, you know, is defense and I don't want to
[00:27:32] be on defense ever, right? I won't be on offense. So where I want to be. So it's a tough, it was a tough
[00:27:37] mission for the guys to meant to, I mean, of course, you, you never know this from their, from their
[00:27:43] professionalism, but no one was saying jumping up and down saying, hey, great, we, we had to be on defense.
[00:27:48] Yeah, all the time for a long period of time. And the fact that the guys did perform so well and
[00:27:55] that we kept the mission again, like you said, we kept the mission because we did a good job,
[00:28:00] not that we were jumping up and down excited about doing it because we don't even be on defense.
[00:28:03] We want to be on offense. Yeah, absolutely. Um, yeah, I look back on my, you know, some of the
[00:28:09] thing, and I did get to do a pretty cool thing there. Um, and then, I mean, we've, we've got to
[00:28:15] see all of our rack, you know, I got to go up to Northern Iraq up in Kurdistan. Oh, yeah, because
[00:28:20] those dignitaries were traveled around. Well, he was Kurdish and he was from, uh, from Northern Iraq,
[00:28:25] and it was, it was gorgeous up there. Yeah. Well, we actually stood, you know, so I had a little
[00:28:31] come to Jesus talk with, um, one of older guys, you know, he was just kind of real in me back in
[00:28:36] because I, I wasn't very happy. I was pissed that other guys were out doing direct actions,
[00:28:41] DAs, and I want to be doing that, and you know, my boy pepper, you know, he talked to me,
[00:28:45] he sat me down, he was like, man, this is a big picture thing, you know, and this is part of it.
[00:28:50] He's like, and you're a new guy. He's like, I know you want to get out there. I know you're
[00:28:54] aggressive, but it's a good deal, you know, like, yes, it's not the ideal thing that we want to do.
[00:29:00] He's like, but this is not a bad deal. You know, we're in civilian clothes and fully armored
[00:29:05] SUVs, you know, getting a trial around this guy. And he just was like, you just need a change in
[00:29:10] mindset, you know, and he's like, you need to stay focused because after this deployment,
[00:29:15] it might be something completely different, you know, and he's like, just stay the core,
[00:29:18] stay focused and, you know, get the mission done. And it was awesome talk. I needed that, you know,
[00:29:23] I just needed that guidance and mentorship, because I was young, you know, for sure.
[00:29:26] Pepper's the older guy, he had a good amount of experience, and, you know, he just,
[00:29:30] you just knew what I needed to hear. And, you know, rough me up a little bit and continue to
[00:29:36] comment, it was good. It was awesome. Learned a lot from it. So yeah. So you get back from that deployment.
[00:29:42] Yep. And this is when you start, you, this is when we formed up, and we started working together.
[00:29:48] Yes, sir. And T U bruiser. Yep. Again, you went to come back from, or, or come back from
[00:29:55] deployment, and then all of a sudden, I was like, hey, we, we need snipers. I'm like, how fast
[00:29:59] I can get over this one, you know. And, uh, literally gone, like again within a week. And, uh,
[00:30:06] went through the NSW short course, which, you know, we didn't get our snipers certificates from that,
[00:30:11] because we didn't do everything, but I didn't care. You're giving me sniper guns. You're, you know,
[00:30:16] I know how to use them. They're dope. Then I get a kill savages. Okay, you know.
[00:30:21] You know what's crazy is, remember when they used to try and they had rules about how much we
[00:30:26] could be gone from home. Yeah. For those days. Oh, we violated it. And it's, it was for, yes, we
[00:30:30] violated it, violated it, violated them. But then young guys and the teams and a lot of old guys, too,
[00:30:35] they literally are raising their hand for everything. Like, oh, yeah, get me out of here, man. Oh,
[00:30:38] you're going to send me that school. Oh, you're going to send me on another deployment. And it's
[00:30:42] weird because there's some people that, you know, a guy that's married has a family that they're,
[00:30:45] they don't want to do that anymore. And they shouldn't have to. But they blanket apply the rules
[00:30:49] across the board, everybody. Because I'll tell you what, when you're 19 years old and you're in the
[00:30:54] Sequel teams, you don't want to be at home any night of the week. You want to be either on
[00:30:58] deployment or getting trained and getting after it. That's what's awesome. Yeah. But they, they
[00:31:03] blanket those rules, which is a bummer. Yeah. I mean, I was just fired up and to go, they're going to
[00:31:09] start for school. Yeah. And I like because, um, you know, it's a big deal. It's a huge deal to get to go
[00:31:15] to start a school. And one of the older guys in the Poutoon, he's still active in the teams,
[00:31:20] I don't want to say his name, but he's one of my real good buddies and I really looked up to him.
[00:31:23] We did an awesome mission together on that first deployment. And I know you're talking about,
[00:31:28] yeah, he's one of my favorite guys. The Badger. Yeah. The Badger. And, um, you know, he's just,
[00:31:36] this is an awesome guy. He was a sniper. You know, he would always talk to me about little
[00:31:40] things. And I was just, even before I went, he was like, teaching me stuff and he's like, yeah,
[00:31:45] you know, this is this. So, I don't know if you had to say him, he going there or what, but I went,
[00:31:49] I was super excited. And then also Chris, you know, Chris was a big influence as well. He's,
[00:31:53] you know, he's a successful sniper on that his second deployment. I first, I'm a loser. Yeah,
[00:31:58] and you're just hearing about what he's doing in a solution. I was like, please, please, Lord.
[00:32:01] Like, I just want to do this so badly. And you hear Chris, you know, tell stories and hear
[00:32:06] other people telling stories about Chris. You know, and I, I even had a buddy who was back from
[00:32:11] Sacramento, who's a Marine, who he was a Marine officer in charge of Chris and those guys over there.
[00:32:16] So he's telling me stories that we're just like, I was like, what? You know, I do this is awesome.
[00:32:22] And so, you guys got, we got to the short course. It was, it was legit. It was in the summer
[00:32:28] out in the mountains and desert doing everything. Guys are blocking out on their stocks because
[00:32:32] it's 120 degrees and you're trying to do a four hour stock in a gilly suit. And, but, uh,
[00:32:37] which was awesome because it prepared us for a Romadi. It's like, dude, the worst stuff, you know,
[00:32:42] you're just, okay, you know, and, you know, how to great time and structures are pretty solid, you know,
[00:32:48] and, um, then all of a sudden it was like, because we had a condensed work up. You know,
[00:32:53] they're like, hey, we got to get gone. So normally, what, you would take 18 months,
[00:32:58] we had a condensed into 11 months. And, you know, all of a sudden, then we're headed out to
[00:33:06] our desert journey facility for our first trip. Yeah. And that's where we met for the first
[00:33:11] met. Yeah. I heard about this guy, Jock. And guys were fired up because we were like,
[00:33:17] dude, this guy is fired up. He's just, you know, I think it was just, you know, this bigger,
[00:33:24] stoic guy that was professional, who had a good amount of experience than teams and who just
[00:33:30] wanted to get in the fight. I was like, yes, this is what we need. You know, it was pretty apparent
[00:33:36] when I first met you that you wanted to get in the fight, too. Yeah, I might have been bandaged up.
[00:33:41] A little bit from smashing out a car window. Yeah. But, you know, yeah, some idiots downtown.
[00:33:50] It's like, what were you saying that was saying to you when I saw that? So when you saw it,
[00:33:55] yeah, you're like, hey, I'm Jocko. I was like, I'm JP. I know you are. I was like, like,
[00:33:59] that, you know, it's kind of like, okay. And you're like, so what's up with the wrist?
[00:34:04] I was like, I got a couple stitches. And you're like, from what? It was like,
[00:34:09] you know, smash out a car window with my elbow and I got caught. He's like, oh,
[00:34:13] you're going to stop doing that stupid shit. Like, yeah, he's like, you need to be training here with the guys
[00:34:17] and with us and focused on work up. And he's like, if you want to fight, we fight. You know,
[00:34:22] I was like, Roger that, sir. And I was like, I'm going to go workout. So I'm going to walk into the gym.
[00:34:29] You know, I just changed out the bandages. I had stitches and staples in my arm and I had all
[00:34:33] bandaged up and trying to get after us. I was going to go workout. And there I see the silver back
[00:34:39] gorilla. It was awesome. It was good. You know, just, and you just set the president, you know,
[00:34:45] you set the tone for, hey, yeah, it's cool to be aggressive and want to fight and get after it. But
[00:34:50] you do it in the right place and the right time and don't forget, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:34:56] we're going to work to kill bad guys. That's the number one focus. And it was just like,
[00:35:00] that just kind of really opened up my eyes. So it was cool. Yeah, and that work up was,
[00:35:08] that work up was awesome. It was so excited. It was so much fun. I mean, just just the energy there.
[00:35:15] I mean, everyone was ready to get after it. And you, you drove it and all of us, you know,
[00:35:19] I remember you coming up to me when we're in between Iads and you're like, hey, every time,
[00:35:25] like, someone gets to door, I want you to be the dude that's as loud as possible. You told me to
[00:35:29] go put to tape J. P on the back of my helmet. I always wanted to be able to find you. And,
[00:35:34] you know, maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but oh no, I did. I mean, that's a legit right there. So,
[00:35:40] hey, I'll tell you right now. I say this all the time. Well, I should, I shouldn't be sad.
[00:35:45] Say I say this all the time. But there's people that have certain qualities, right? Certain qualities,
[00:35:51] whether they're leadership qualities, whether they're skills at art or at speaking or at basketball,
[00:35:58] right? People have certain qualities. So, you had a good ability. You had a great ability to get
[00:36:04] command of something and make something happen very quickly, right? And that's, it's a because you're
[00:36:09] allowed, you're allowed number one, number two, you're aggressive. Number three, you can take whatever
[00:36:13] that problem is and like get it into some quick words. You can simplify it into something quickly and
[00:36:18] say it. And as soon as I saw that you could do that, because we have to get people to perform
[00:36:24] fairly complex things in chaotic situations. But when I saw that you had that skill,
[00:36:30] I said, okay, he's a guy that I can utilize and that his Petune Commander can utilize and that
[00:36:35] that the whole troop can utilize to handle such certain situations when there's some chaos going on
[00:36:40] and something needs to be straightened up. So, what I want you to do is take some rigors tape and
[00:36:43] I want you to write J.P. on your helmet. So, whenever I'm looking around on my night vision or
[00:36:48] or during the daytime and I see you just see a bunch of helmets that look the same. Now, I know it's
[00:36:51] J.P. When I see him coming like, oh, J.P. Make this happen right here. And J.P. can make it happen right there.
[00:36:56] I still have that helmet with the tape. I'm sitting in my garage on the shelf. That's all.
[00:37:02] That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. So, we get, we get obviously orders two weeks prior to
[00:37:12] deployment that we're going to our body. We had thought we were going somewhere else. We thought
[00:37:16] we were going to back dad. We thought we're going to have kind of a cookie cutter deployment of
[00:37:19] what the teams have been doing for a few years. And we find out two weeks before deployment that
[00:37:25] we're going to our body. And, wait, how did you find out? Then I call, do I? Did the Delta soon
[00:37:32] come in? Did the chief call you? How did you find out we were going to our body? Because you guys were all
[00:37:35] on leave. You remember? I don't, I don't think they even told us to talk about that about it.
[00:37:40] I mean, because they did all the interviews. They did all the interviews. What was going on?
[00:37:43] Yeah, they did all the interviews. Yeah, they did all the interviews. I don't think they told us
[00:37:47] about it until I told the leaders. Yeah. And, as it hey guys, stand by to get some.
[00:37:55] Yeah. Yeah, because I remember we found out we were on leave. We came home.
[00:37:59] Came back to San Diego and we're getting a roll out. That's when we found out where we're going.
[00:38:05] And we're getting right in. We had all our families. We had our families, you know,
[00:38:11] the day we're shipping off to say goodbye. And there's a couple of guys like reading, like news reports
[00:38:16] and articles about the area we're going to. And I'm like trying to like pull them all the way.
[00:38:20] So she doesn't hear this, you know what I mean? And my dad's just like listening, like getting fired up.
[00:38:25] He's like, yes. You know, my dad, you know, you could tell as a father, he's very excited for me.
[00:38:31] My mom's terrified and nervous. But my dad was nervous as well. Rightfully so, you know,
[00:38:37] like your son's going off to war and combat, but he was just, it was just mixing emotions for him.
[00:38:42] And so he was trying to hide like the nervousness by saying, when are you leaving?
[00:38:47] Come on, we've been waiting. It's about time for you to go. One of my dad here.
[00:38:50] He's just remembered when I got told, when they said the, when the commanding officer brought me in,
[00:38:58] and he's trying to sell to me, going to Ramadi instead of going to Baghdad, he's like
[00:39:05] proposing it as like, hey, you know, this could be good. And inside, I'm like, oh my God, I'm like still.
[00:39:11] And I remembered, I bargained for something. There's something that I said, well,
[00:39:16] well, we want this. If we can do this, then we can make it happen. I think it was gear or some kind of
[00:39:20] gear swap we did. But anyways, I remember them trying to sell it to me. And I knew I was in such a
[00:39:26] good position because it's like someone trying to sell you free money. You know what I mean?
[00:39:31] I was like, oh, you want to screw the money? Okay. Let me think about that for a second.
[00:39:36] And inside, I'm going, don't blow it. Just act cool. Yeah. How careful. Those get too excited. Just,
[00:39:41] you know, maybe you might be able to leverage something, just relax inside. Like, okay, you know,
[00:39:45] I think we can make it happen. I need a little bit of this. I might need a couple more support
[00:39:48] personnel out there to give us a hand getting acclimated and getting the turnover done. But if I can get
[00:39:53] five or six more personas, I'm just gathering logistics support for my troop. And that's what I was
[00:39:59] bargaining for. I was gathering logistics support for the troop getting more C. B's to come help us.
[00:40:05] And more intel guys. Like, as long as we can have this and that. And he's like, yeah, I'll talk to them.
[00:40:10] We'll see if we can make it happen. And it happened. Yeah. The C.O. is awesome. Solid dude. Yeah.
[00:40:19] Yeah. So I remember, yeah, because I got in trouble when I went home on leave during Christmas
[00:40:25] time. Am I seeing some kind of a pattern of trouble here? Or, you know, if you want to say that,
[00:40:32] you know what, but I just want to my best friend. I didn't have the outlets. One of my best friends
[00:40:36] in the Silti when I was younger, right? We were the same way. We were maniacs. And one time he got
[00:40:43] in a really big trouble. And the, the platoon commander, who's one of my favorite guys in the guy that
[00:40:50] inspired me to go the officer route because he was a priori and listed guy and he was an awesome guy.
[00:40:55] He was made the platoon awesome for us. That guy. So I'm thinking he's going to, he must be so angry
[00:41:02] at my buddy that got in big trouble. Like borderline international incident. And I kind of said,
[00:41:08] hey, you know, are you mad at him for what happened or what do you think of this? And he goes,
[00:41:14] he said something along the lines of, he's a warrior. You can't stop these things from happening.
[00:41:22] It's, it's in your guys' blood. We have to just deal with it the best we can. Yeah, and you,
[00:41:28] you guys did, you know, that's what I was always, that's what was always my attitude. You know,
[00:41:32] I look back now I'm 33 and I'm like man, but you know, you learn from your mistakes. And he makes
[00:41:38] you don't, you know, pay them again. I got, you know, I got, I was up in Reno, I got arrested for,
[00:41:42] you know, like older guys started to fight with me and my friends. And I was with non-team guy
[00:41:46] friends. They're super passive guys. And he's an older, like much bigger guy, you know, and
[00:41:52] you know, it was coming out, you had a bottle on his hand. There's just, you know, anyways,
[00:41:56] do some damage to him. He ends up in the hospital for a long time. I get rolled up, I get arrested.
[00:42:02] I go there, they're looking to my wallet, they're like security clients,
[00:42:05] still team 3 and I'm like, yeah, and the cop goes, why didn't you tell me this?
[00:42:11] When we're out there, he's like, I would have dropped you off around the corner.
[00:42:14] I was like, well, I didn't want, you know, I'm not going to try to pull that card. I made him a
[00:42:18] stake. He's like, well, you're here now. So we have to deal with it. So I go home. I remember I,
[00:42:23] and I tell the LPO about it, it's like, we got to tell Chief and Chief's like, are we going to
[00:42:29] still the LIC? We got to go tell the Command Mass Chief, Command Mass Chief, you know, an
[00:42:34] awesome Mass Chief was press on and bro. Too phenomenal. I mean, just couldn't get better,
[00:42:40] higher- than-lessed leaders ever, right? So of course, you know, they're here in the story,
[00:42:44] and they kind of like give me the rundown. You know, Mass Chief press on goes,
[00:42:49] but you think you're the first team guy to get a rest of your fighting? Let me tell you some stories.
[00:42:54] He just kind of, he's like, hey, we just got, we got to fix this. You know what I mean? He's like,
[00:42:57] obviously there's clearly self-defense, and he's like, whatever you need from us. That was good.
[00:43:02] Cool, whatever. What I do is I make the mistake is I go back home on Christmas leaves shortly
[00:43:07] after that, and I got to wet and reckless. So not a DUI, but you know, whatever, close enough,
[00:43:13] I was an idiot, and, you know, I'm super mad. You know, I'm only 22, you know, I'm not even 23 yet.
[00:43:20] And, you know, we were crushing the work up, so it was, I was built, I felt even better about life,
[00:43:27] and everything, I was like that, and we know we're going to war, and you know, I just made
[00:43:31] a mistake, and you know, pay the consequences, you know, I'd come home, and I'm like, oh,
[00:43:36] what do I do? I'm like, they're going to kill me. I was like, I'm possibly not going to
[00:43:42] deploy. And I remember I broke down, like I just broke down emotionally. I'm like, I just threw
[00:43:47] everything away, you know, like, for what, you know, and I was really upset, and I went and told
[00:43:54] the Badger, you know, about it first, I was like, I need some advice. And I was like, you know,
[00:43:59] I think I can take leave and take care of this on my own, and everything, he goes,
[00:44:03] yeah, I think we can, he's like, but if not, you know, it's a big risk, you know,
[00:44:08] he's like dude, we have solid leadership right now. Now's the time that you just get your
[00:44:14] book kicked for this, and just deal with it, you know, he's like, dude, just take what comes out
[00:44:18] you. I'm like, I broke, you know, I was like sick to my stomach, I was like, oh, I don't know how
[00:44:24] this could turn out. We go to the LPL, he's like, you boo boo, I'm like, right, you have
[00:44:29] to get rid of that, go to chief, chief, same thing, go, LIC, I was Andrew Paul, Andrew Paul,
[00:44:37] like, JP, really. Like, he was just, what hurt is how disappointed everyone is disappointed,
[00:44:42] like you're better than that. And I was, you know, and then so we go back over there to go talk
[00:44:49] to Master Chief Yardboro and press on, and I was just like, I was so ashamed. Like, I was just,
[00:44:56] you know, I just got the chills, I was just, I was disgusted myself, you know. So, you know,
[00:45:00] they got through and they're like, all right, well, I'm gonna have a chief, chief, you're bored.
[00:45:05] So if you go to keep your tried and stay in the teams, I was just like, try not to throw up
[00:45:11] like you're dead in there, I'm like, go back to the between space. Like, how do you even
[00:45:15] function the rest of the day after that? Like, I was like, someone looking at the bathroom,
[00:45:19] I'm like, maybe we shouldn't have that best, you know, maybe I was like, dude,
[00:45:23] anyways, um, on social short, they, uh, I had the chief's review board, and luckily,
[00:45:31] they were doing remodeling over the compound. So I was two rooms over, but the ceilings were open
[00:45:36] and vaulted. So I could hear them all talking about me beforehand. And of course, you had a bunch of,
[00:45:41] like, it was all the cheese in the command. And you know, there was some cheese there that,
[00:45:44] you know, were support person now. They're like, screw this kid, let's move a ball. Like,
[00:45:48] you know, a lot, and then like, your bro goes, hold up. Like, the kids are good, kid. I was with
[00:45:54] him at SKT, you know, he made a mistake. And so, like, remember him taking my back because he's like,
[00:46:00] oh, really? Let's get ready. And he starts pulling up like, other guys that had made my
[00:46:05] stakes, he's like, what about when you did this? And what about when you did that? He's like,
[00:46:09] no, he's good. And press on, he's like, nope, we're keeping them. We're going to crush him,
[00:46:13] but we're keeping them. So I go in there and luckily I had heard that. And so I went in there and just,
[00:46:18] you know, face the man and, you know, the whole rest of work up, I know, it was on restriction.
[00:46:24] Yeah, we're on the road. We're awesome trips. We're going to Vegas for a work trip. And guess who
[00:46:28] has a curfew? Did you ever curfew during that? I don't. I do remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Like,
[00:46:34] if I was to go get out food, I had to be back with it in a certain time frame. They're like,
[00:46:37] oh, wait, actually, guess what? They serve food here. So you don't need to leave the building.
[00:46:41] You can get room service because you don't need to be sitting down at the tables. I'm like,
[00:46:46] you know, but whatever. I think it's good that you had that kind of sense of fear in there. I mean,
[00:46:51] just looking back, I can tell you right now, you could have like, you could have committed
[00:46:56] a broad series of crimes against humanity. And I would have still taken you on the foot.
[00:47:01] And I basically told, bro, that for sure, like, hey, I don't give a shit. Yeah. You know,
[00:47:08] it's just, it was very lucky in blast. We were blessed to have, you know, good leaders like you
[00:47:13] and bro and press on in those guys that were just like, hey, man, guys make mistakes. We're going to,
[00:47:18] we're going to fix it. You know, it's not like you guys are like, oh, no big deal. You're like,
[00:47:22] oh, cool. You got to learn. You got to learn from it, you know, and you know, I definitely learned from it.
[00:47:26] And the C.O. was super cool. And the C.O. stood by what you guys stood. And that said a lot to me about
[00:47:32] him as a leader as well because he trusted you guys as judge. And I remember he comes out like,
[00:47:37] towards the inner part of the point that we're going to be getting it. We've been getting it the
[00:47:40] whole time. He's like, man, really glad I listened to them and kept you around. Like, so it was this
[00:47:45] awesome. I kind of turned around because it was basically you guys were like, hey, we're going to hold it
[00:47:49] worth that. And we'll see how he does on the point. And when he comes back, we'll hammer him and if we need to.
[00:47:55] So yeah. All right. So we go on the point that. Yep. And like you said, like, people are reading the
[00:48:03] newspaper. I mean, I knew because I was reading all the intel. I mean, I was totally read in and
[00:48:08] was trying to explain to you guys and telling you guys, staying by to get some. We show up there and
[00:48:15] do some, do some, you know, basically the forces almost instantly divided into five different teams.
[00:48:22] And we end up doing big operation over an eastern Romadi. And that kind of set the tone and
[00:48:29] carved out a little space for a certain crew. And actually, in the retirement speech that I gave,
[00:48:35] you know, I talk about, hey, we're going to send some guys over here. If you want to go volunteer,
[00:48:39] you got to put your name on this list. And of course, everyone put the name on the list,
[00:48:43] which made it go back to the original plan, which was the Delta Plunk Tune Commander saying,
[00:48:49] you know, these are the guys who take I need whatever. Eight guys, I'll take these guys. And,
[00:48:53] you know, had a little make sure that we weren't making anything too unbalanced. But obviously,
[00:48:58] obviously, he wanted you with him. And so you guys roll out to
[00:49:06] correct it or with the first the 506 band brothers. Yeah, those guys are phenomenal. Yeah,
[00:49:12] love those guys. Talk about full metal jacket. A blown out old school. I think it's old school
[00:49:24] or like a university university. All the universities just completely blown out like walls. I mean,
[00:49:30] there's more bags of sand than concrete. I think they're holding the place up.
[00:49:35] You know, with Army Marines live with us in there. And I always show up. Or just like,
[00:49:40] yeah, we for when I went there for that big first kickoff. Yeah, that place was just dirt floors,
[00:49:47] mosquitoes everywhere, bugs everywhere. Yeah. I don't even think there was AC. No, there was,
[00:49:53] it was like one dangling light in every room. Yeah. That was hard living. But that was all one big
[00:49:59] room. They had like thick, they had like a sheet of plywood that divided the big room that
[00:50:04] we all ended up eventually like building our own rooms into. Yeah. I remember getting over there and,
[00:50:09] you know, guys, I was so fired up. Yes, I'm in it. Like this is horrible. It's horrible because
[00:50:17] there's a fight going on right here. You know what I mean? Like the nice built up basis. There's
[00:50:21] not a fight there. Where it's like horrible? You know, there's a fight. I was just super excited.
[00:50:26] Yeah, Craig and I were always awesome. And there was guys with the first the 506. That place was
[00:50:30] getting mortar every day. That place was getting attacked every day. I mean, remember when we first went
[00:50:36] there and it was like, I said, um, guys, like, can we can we go up on the walls? Can I just
[00:50:40] my first go up on the walls and like defend? And I was like, um, yes. And we did. Yeah, you guys went
[00:50:46] up and started whacking people all the time. Yeah, it was awesome. You didn't even have to leave
[00:50:50] base to kill guys. Yeah. That what kind of a joy is that right there? It's like the best Christmas
[00:50:55] present ever. But it was also the same times like if you want to go grab a child, you have to be
[00:50:59] in full body armor, helmet and your gun because you've got to constantly attack. There's a couple
[00:51:04] times to hear. Do, do, do, and you just hear the incoming mortars and you're sprinting to try to
[00:51:09] either get, you're like, when you're in the middle, you're like, do I go back? Do I go to the
[00:51:13] childhood or are they aiming for our building this time? You know, I remember there was one time
[00:51:17] I was going out to take a shower. This is just a no. Just make one and go. And um, this is a complete
[00:51:26] had my angels god thing and we come back from it up and guys are smoked right? And the most
[00:51:32] guys are just like, I'm just going to get in the bed like my baby wipe shower and just lay down.
[00:51:37] I just wanted to actually just go take a shower right? And so the army guys are awesome. They
[00:51:41] gave us the code so we could use it on our times when we came back, you know, instead of the standard
[00:51:46] schedule of the army shower time. So I go out there and get to the shower tent and like,
[00:51:52] forgot my lufus sponge. You know, so I can actually try to like wash with my soap and
[00:51:56] our car and cord JP Denel in combat. You know what you got to bring to combat with you?
[00:52:02] Guffing your lufus sponge. That's what I'm talking about. You got to clean the body.
[00:52:07] So anyway, I cycle back and um, as I'm walking back up the steps to get into the thing,
[00:52:14] shower tent gets hit by three mortars. Oh yeah, just showing gone like I was like,
[00:52:22] okay, that was the shower tent that was like 20 meters from full metal jacket, right?
[00:52:26] Yeah, I legitimately was just like in there and I was like, I remember I was like, I'll just put the
[00:52:31] soap in my hands and I was like, nope, that was complete. I had my angels, you know, god was like,
[00:52:37] no, you need to get out of here. And so I walked back and I literally taken the last step like
[00:52:42] into that little dark hallway and I was like, okay, where's my baby wife? So I can
[00:52:50] have to go get some baby and that's what was so crazy. It was like something like that. It was just like,
[00:52:54] okay, shit, I'm pissed. You know, and so baby wife's up and until we get that fix,
[00:53:00] we're doing bottle water shower. You know, you poke holes in the top of a water bottle and
[00:53:05] your buddy squeezes it over you and that's how we shower. Yeah. Yeah. It was awesome.
[00:53:09] Yeah. And that's another thing. The, the, the army guys for the first of the 506. I mean,
[00:53:17] obviously they're living that way too. But every day you'd see them, they're always in the square
[00:53:21] away uniforms, always, you know, shaving every day. No slack. No fucking slack whatsoever.
[00:53:26] Yeah. The first of the 506. And that was the attitude that you guys went over with. Yeah.
[00:53:31] We know. Actually, I made sure our guys had shaved heads because I was the acting
[00:53:35] LPO. The badger was the acting chief. And we, I mean, we rocked the army cam. Yeah. We put
[00:53:42] you guys in the army cam. We camis and we all had shaved heads and we shaved every day. You know,
[00:53:47] we just looked like the army. I mean, because who cares about haircut and a shave? You know,
[00:53:53] unless I needed to have a beard, which I mean, I have a red beard. So who am I blending in with
[00:53:57] Russians or Irish? You know, I mean, like, I'm in Iraq. You know, I'm in like a bright blue eyes and a red beard.
[00:54:03] Oh, it must be a local. Oh, like, so being attacked by leopard. Yeah.
[00:54:08] Chewing it. That's a giant tattooed leopard cons. And so, you know, we just shaved heads and got
[00:54:14] after it. And I mean, you know, like why? It doesn't matter. That doesn't make you a less
[00:54:21] effective, you know, either way. You know, and you could tell that, you know, you could flip side that.
[00:54:26] The other way is like, hey, well, if I'm long hair and beard, what does that matter? It really doesn't.
[00:54:30] But it's the army's battle space. And we respected and loved those guys. They were phenomenal
[00:54:36] guys to work for. So why are we going to do something that is just to pass them off? You know,
[00:54:41] why? Who cares? Like, so we just shaved and, you know, how to keep their heads shaved,
[00:54:45] which is awesome, actually, because your, your helmet stuck to that like a little broo-up hat.
[00:54:50] And I didn't move around a lot. And, you know, and then the Marines that were with this
[00:54:54] Anglical guys, those phenomenal guys, you know, they started doing the same thing. They were shaving
[00:54:59] their heads and my boy Nick Hobbs, you know, he was with us. He's out. He's an awesome stud
[00:55:04] Marine. And, you know, we always joke about he's like, man, like, he's, I just remember like this,
[00:55:09] we all like just would hang out in our free time. And he's like, you come really close with somebody
[00:55:13] when they're standing in there like boxer breeds and you're having to pour water over them
[00:55:17] for them to shower. And we're up on the rooftop right? Like doing bottles of water shower. And it's just
[00:55:23] just funny man, like I miss those days. Yeah. Yeah. And just so everybody knows now, I mean,
[00:55:30] just to kind of give an overview if you don't know what the, what the overall operations that
[00:55:36] were taking place were pushing in the camp carregador, which we've been talking about, which is
[00:55:41] where this building full metal jacket was was on Eastern Ramadi. And the first the 506 was
[00:55:47] responsible for the Eastern Carter Ramadi, the really the southeast, turned in some other sections,
[00:55:52] but where the seal platoon was or the seal squad now is basically a smaller group as a
[00:55:59] work and was inside this area called the Malab district. And as the first the 506 would do
[00:56:04] big clearance operations. You guys would go out and primarily do sniper over watch. Although you,
[00:56:10] of course, you did, you did all their stuff, you did clearances and all that, but the primary
[00:56:13] mission, thank God you went to sniper school because you were the lead sniper and you did a lot of
[00:56:18] sniper work over there. Yeah, it was awesome. We got just right place right time, you know,
[00:56:24] it was just a thought I can really explain. Yeah. Now we worked to get work and we, you know,
[00:56:30] we pushed the envelope constantly, but we were no better than anybody over there, just we were
[00:56:36] just hungry, you know, we wanted it so bad. And I remember when we showed up there,
[00:56:41] the Colonel, you know, won't say his name, but he was awesome, you know, I mean,
[00:56:48] I was she was running for president. Absolutely. I would vote for him and obviously I would vote
[00:56:54] for him instantly. Yeah. He was just unbelievable. Go to campaign trail. Yeah, I can a heartbeat.
[00:56:59] No doubt. No doubt. Anyways, awesome guy and, you know, you talk about communication from
[00:57:06] leadership. You talk about a guy that say his name, by the way. He's a general now. He, it's,
[00:57:12] it's very obvious who it is, the commander of the first the 506 during the battle of Ramadi.
[00:57:16] Okay. A guy by the name of Ronald Clark. Ron Clark was just unbelievable leader and,
[00:57:25] yeah, just an unbelievable leader. Ron Clark 2020. Yeah. But, awesome, awesome guy, but he,
[00:57:32] you know, he had the ability to communicate with us where we wanted to help him. Of course.
[00:57:37] And he was just like, hey, guys, I need help, you know, that's one thing I learned later on
[00:57:42] a life is like, when I was doing sales, I'm like, people don't want to be helped, but they want to
[00:57:46] help. And he knew that, you know, and so he's like, guys, I need help. We're losing guys every day.
[00:57:50] This is what we're going on. Hey, here's your R always. Please go get some. And we're like,
[00:57:56] yes, like this is it. And we had that connection with them. And, you know, just being able to go out and
[00:58:01] work for them was phenomenal. Yeah. And just, just awesome. I mean, the Delta Poutine Commander
[00:58:09] formed such a good relationship with those guys and was, and you know, my relationship with him.
[00:58:17] Yeah. I mean, he was just solid dude and wanted to get after it. Yes, wanted to get after it
[00:58:27] as much as humanly possible. Yeah. And then some and then a little bit more, yeah, and with a little bit more on top of that.
[00:58:34] Right. So yeah, it was great. Great combination. And you actually, you did a lot of those operations too. So yeah,
[00:58:41] kind of the standard, we called standard. It wasn't that standard at the time. They time presence
[00:58:46] which rolls get some. No, and when I did that, I cared the mark 46. Oh, five, five, six belt
[00:58:52] fed action. And it was awesome. You know, you have two on a round of the gun. And I threw another 800
[00:58:57] rounds on my front. I had another 200 in the back. So 12 on a round with body armor, grenades,
[00:59:04] smokes, water. And that's when I was, when I said that story to the beginning, he's like,
[00:59:08] one of those first big operations we did out there. And that's where that's where that's from.
[00:59:12] That's where that memory's from to see you walk and you're being okay. Guess all those way that he
[00:59:17] acted during training with paintball. He's gonna act the same way right here with his life on the
[00:59:21] line. Either walk, it was cool because I either walked a point or rear security because I was
[00:59:26] a machine gunner. You know, and you want a machine gun up front and you want one on the back
[00:59:30] because they're coming from the rear. I just remember that, you know, first push that you were
[00:59:35] talking about the first real firefighter got into just cut these dudes at half. And it was awesome.
[00:59:42] And, you know, everything that Colonel told us was gonna happen happened. Hey, usually within this
[00:59:48] amount of time, friend, they start coming out. Here's what they do. They come around the corner,
[00:59:52] then they distract you and they do this. And this is when they attack happens. And like,
[00:59:57] like, luck work. I mean, these savages were just coming out as exactly how we were told it was
[01:00:01] gonna come out as. Yeah. And that I think that helped us gain even more respect for the army that
[01:00:06] we worked for because they could have just been like, hey, go get some, but they're like, hey,
[01:00:10] go get someone come back. So you can continue getting something. Yeah, know that the turnover
[01:00:14] that we would get from those guys was phenomenal. And the professionalism that they had like what
[01:00:18] you're talking about, like the Charlie Company commander, crazy Joe. Yeah. And he was freaking awesome.
[01:00:26] And one of the things that he would do, and this is when I said, oh, he this guy is all the next level.
[01:00:30] He's doing something that I never even thought of every time he went on patrol in the Malab.
[01:00:35] He was recording it. He was video recording it. And then he'd come back and review every street
[01:00:39] corner, every building, every signpost. He knew everything about it. You know, that city. He took his job
[01:00:46] like so seriously down. It was, it was phenomenal. I remember the Delta Poutine commander had told me
[01:00:52] that he was doing that or we knew that. And it really emphasized us to, hey, we need to know
[01:00:59] this area just as well. And I mean, it didn't take long. I'm not trying to be cocky or anything,
[01:01:05] but within a couple weeks, like I didn't need my map. Like I knew that city. You know, I mean,
[01:01:10] like, now I had the map on me too. So if I needed to look at it and be like, oh, I'm at this building.
[01:01:14] Hey, we're pushing over here. So I can scan real quick and go. But like I knew exactly where
[01:01:20] I was at all times because I, those guys did. And we needed to know that you can't have a delay in
[01:01:25] communication when you're in a firefight, you know, or, you know, or guys are down, you know,
[01:01:29] and there's just, and I went, you know, just, I heard it over the radio and Cowie got shot. Just,
[01:01:38] like, I'll never forget that, you know. And knowing exactly where they're at. And there's a
[01:01:42] little confusion leaving. And I was like, no, we need to go this way. I would generally just
[01:01:46] start running that way, you know, because you just hear Mikey opening up and the badgers trying
[01:01:52] to pull him out. You just, your boys are in a firefight and you just don't know what's going to happen.
[01:01:56] And we're trying to get there as fast as we could and it was just like, we got, I mean, we
[01:02:01] legitimately got there as fast as we could. And it was because we knew we had to be prepared, you know.
[01:02:06] And could you imagine if we didn't know where exactly they were or where we were and you're
[01:02:11] sitting there like, trying to listen to a map, you know, read a map when you hear your boy
[01:02:14] over the radio, like, have been shot and shot and you just hear huge machine gun just going off
[01:02:19] and you're just like, like, but the boys were with, that's between commander, the breath,
[01:02:25] JP, where we, you know, he knew we were out, but he's like, hey, where do we need to go? You know,
[01:02:29] exactly. And you know, because he's a, he could have gotten us there, but he wanted me to
[01:02:33] guess there because I was, no, that's the point. He could write all the things. He doesn't need to be
[01:02:37] worried about that because he's working too radio, trying to get in cat, you know, he's got to
[01:02:41] figure out, like, hey, let's get some tanks in here to mow the city down to get our boy out
[01:02:46] and get them to the hospital, you know, and so the story that JP's talking about right there
[01:02:50] is like, that's first significant gazzle that we had. We had some other guys get fragged a little bit,
[01:02:54] but that was the first one, uh, Kawi, yeah, and Kawi got shot and uh, about losses like, they were
[01:03:01] able to save it now. He's a stud, yeah, still, you know, but uh, she was, she is, or lepros don't
[01:03:11] lose their spots. Yeah, no doubt. He's still warrior inside and out, solid. Yeah, he's a guy that
[01:03:17] tells the story about where, like, when I want to see him in Charlie Medseries all morphed
[01:03:21] up, we rolled in there and I like went to shake his hand, like a bro handshake and in like when
[01:03:28] I grabbed, he reached up, he grabbed my hand and he like pulls me down, right? And he, and he, and he's like,
[01:03:34] in my ear, and he goes, let me stay. Oh yeah, he was, I'm like, I'm like, hey bro, you're about to lose your life.
[01:03:42] I, I didn't tell him that, but I was like, hey bro, let's make sure you get healed up and
[01:03:46] I think you're gonna have to leave. And he's like, just, he's like, let me stay because I don't care.
[01:03:53] I'll, I'll, I'll all, all clean, you know, but this let me stay. And I was like, bro, we're uh,
[01:04:00] it's just going healed up. If you have to go, go, go, heal up, we'll bring it back. And of course
[01:04:04] he and he'll up fast enough because it was pretty jacked up. He got a armor piercing round. It's like the
[01:04:07] entered like down by his knee and exited up by his growing. Yeah, they hit the femur right. Yeah,
[01:04:12] just travel. I mean, he's nasty. He's lucky. He has like, absolutely. He's a legitimate lucky. So
[01:04:18] I've got to get him on the podcast. I'm done. His whole life is awesome. All right. Well, you know what,
[01:04:23] you know what, I was thinking there's one more up that I was thinking of besides the kind of urban
[01:04:28] sniper operations you were doing. Yeah, and presence patrols. You need to cool up that was a little
[01:04:34] bit more like, late for an hour is talking about how, oh, you know what, you know, it's not like
[01:04:40] you're seeing the movies because with these sniper overwatch positions, we'd have a bunch of people with us.
[01:04:43] You know, we have 20, 15, 20, 10, 30 people. You have a lot of people to be in these buildings and
[01:04:49] hold security and all that. It was as in the movies they always portray like two guys out in the middle of
[01:04:54] nowhere. And we always go, yeah, no, that's not that realistic. But you guys actually did go and
[01:04:59] all that. Yeah, we did. It was fun. It was pretty awesome. Yeah, so up in northern Sofia, we're getting
[01:05:08] just hammered by mortars, you know, just constantly. We knew that's where they're coming from.
[01:05:14] So we get dropped off a little outstation north of, you know, the Milab district and we just did a
[01:05:22] patrol. It was a long patrol up there. And remember, you know, we're, you know, hugging the river,
[01:05:28] trying to stay as close to the river as we can. It's, you know, you go from the drive to dead city to
[01:05:34] this lush vegetation and you're trying to patrol through that. I'm just like, oh, dude, hands, like,
[01:05:41] all the guys in Vietnam, all those guys like just got off to it. Like, I've always respected them. But
[01:05:47] that just brought a new level of respect. Like, we have night vision. They didn't. They're nice and
[01:05:53] tired. You know, I was just like, and it is, it is hard for everyone to understand that that area
[01:05:57] north of Ramadi that was like well, irrigated by the river by the refugees. Yeah, it looked like
[01:06:03] Vietnam. Yeah. They had palm trees. It had like patties and dikes and all that stuff. It looked like
[01:06:09] Vietnam. Yeah. And Laf we're talking about the other days. Like, there was like the bull pulling a
[01:06:15] plow type situation straight up. Look like Vietnam. Yeah. It was crazy. So anyways, we go up there
[01:06:21] and mad, it was, we had dogs that were following us. So I can't say his name is still in, but he always
[01:06:30] he carried a suppressed MP5 with subsonic rounds. So he was our dog killer. And that was pretty funny.
[01:06:39] And so he just, you know, these are bad savage dogs. And so we're getting up there, you know,
[01:06:47] barking given away our location. So we, you know, handle them, we keep going. And we get set up at night,
[01:06:53] you know, we get all OPs set up and, you know, we're right on the river. Like, that's around the river
[01:06:58] because we, you know, if we need the boats to come in support us, they can come in. We can get fast.
[01:07:02] That's extra out of there. And, you know, so I mean the badger, we, you know, we have changed out into all of our stuff.
[01:07:11] You know, like we're, we're caring gear for like three or four days, right? Like, it's almost physically impossible to carry that much water.
[01:07:18] Like, and all your ammo and everything else like that. And so we get it done and we change out,
[01:07:25] get on our guillotine suits. And I just remember like thinking like, dude, this is like, yes, it's it.
[01:07:31] Like, you see like the ambient light coming in through the trees where we're all like hidden and
[01:07:35] veged up in the guys who set their perimeter. We're in our, we're in our guillotine suits. And we just,
[01:07:41] boom, and one of the other guys like to use awesome, you know, guys are there and we're turning around.
[01:07:45] He goes, and you go to gone. Like you just disappeared in the dark and, you know, we wouldn't
[01:07:50] got set up, you know. And like I said, you know, the badger was, you know, he was a sniper before,
[01:07:57] you know, so I learned a lot from him. And but this time we both had a good amount of experience of
[01:08:01] actually on the gun and whatnot. And so he was, you know, no, no ego with them. You know, he was just so like
[01:08:07] easy back. He's like, man, this is what we're going to do. What do you think? I'm like, yeah, let's do it.
[01:08:11] And then there's a, I'm like, hey, maybe we should change up that. He's like, all right, yeah, let's do that.
[01:08:15] And so we end up veging up in this area that I mean, it was the only the opportunity for where we had to be,
[01:08:23] wasn't ideal, you know. We legitimately were on the other side of these bushes out in the open.
[01:08:29] It was like thick bushes around us. So we could wedge up and blend in, but we were out there by ourselves.
[01:08:36] And we knew that. And we had after we did a recon, we told the guys, okay, this is the only place we can go.
[01:08:40] This is what you really like the only place we can go to be able to, you know, get these guys. And so our
[01:08:45] contingency is if something happened, we're going to have to wait a while before the guys could actually
[01:08:49] move to a position to provide cover fire and, you know, everything else like that. And we're like,
[01:08:54] all right, cool, you know, not a big deal. Yeah. And so like, cool, we have our pistols and sniper rifles,
[01:08:59] you know what I mean? And so we go off, we get veged up, we, you know, help veging each other, get ourselves
[01:09:04] into position, raffles are laying like kind of underneath the, the drag bags, which are veged up.
[01:09:09] And we had our pistols out just because I mean, there's, I don't know, people can't see us right now,
[01:09:14] but there's the distance from me to you. We had people walking past us. And it was just one of those things.
[01:09:19] So three, four, five meters away. Yeah, five meters. There's, there's people walking by. Yeah,
[01:09:24] just walking by us. And we're out there, you know, all throughout the night, the day, you know,
[01:09:28] it's one of those things. We're like, I have to pee. You know, you're not trying to drink too much water.
[01:09:33] You don't have to use it by the same time. You're like, it's hot. So I need to luckily, since it is that hot,
[01:09:38] you're in a gilly suit, you're sweat most of it out anyways, but, you know, cold time to add a piece.
[01:09:42] So you like slightly roll over, dig a hole, relieve yourself, cover back up, and lay back on top of it,
[01:09:48] you know, and it was good though. You know, we actually got, got mordered at that position.
[01:09:56] And we, we got lucky. You know, we definitely had our angels there because, you know, it messed up
[01:10:04] our radios temporarily. And everything around us was just kind of tore up. Look, all the bushes
[01:10:10] and everything. And we didn't get hit by one thing. And, you know, it was just like, hey, what
[01:10:16] would we do? Do we stay here? Do we move them? Well, our radios rejected up. So, you know, luckily,
[01:10:22] you know, they didn't move us, you know, it's starting to lay down, cover fire while we're trying
[01:10:26] to move back to them. So we just waited a little bit, make sure like we weren't trying to get
[01:10:32] suckered out, you know, ambushed or anything. And then we just slowly made our way back to the
[01:10:37] group. We told what happened. I mean, dude, me and him were pretty jacked up from that. Like, we're
[01:10:41] thrown up like just the blast and everything else. Like, 120s, you think? I did honest, I have no idea.
[01:10:47] There's a couple of them. But like, if they rocked you that hard, then they were big. We were throwing
[01:10:52] up the whole patrol back. Oh, and we were all throwing up. We evolved, we were all tabled in our
[01:11:00] urine and stool after that. And it was just, I mean, I was, but you know, whatever. I mean,
[01:11:05] we got the guys and, you know, we called in counter stuff and we came back and everyone was happy
[01:11:12] because they didn't get more the base thing getting harder for a while. So I remember after that,
[01:11:16] the laundry guys, you know, these guys were like doing a laundry. Like, they're so stoked that we did
[01:11:22] that. We're like, man, we were stoked. We got to do that, you know, the name, that's awesome.
[01:11:27] They would come and like, come and pick up our laundry for us and we're like, dude, oh, we're good.
[01:11:32] Like, this is awkward. Like, you know, I mean, like, you know, go pick up your boys, laundry. Like,
[01:11:37] we're, we're good. But it was, it was really cool to be able to do that. You know, something completely
[01:11:41] outside the box that we hadn't been doing the whole time. So we were able to go from, and it just came
[01:11:47] from good planning. We had, like I said, we had solid leadership. So we had a good plans in place.
[01:11:51] Yeah. Yeah. And it was the amount of sustained combat operations for the whole past,
[01:12:00] it was was, was damn. It was an incredible opt-up. Yeah. It was just like, up, up, up, up,
[01:12:08] every day to one unit, two unit, three elements going out for us. It's all the time. Yeah.
[01:12:14] So we start getting towards the end of this deployment. And obviously, Mark got killed on August 2nd.
[01:12:30] And, and then September 29th, Mike, you get killed. Yeah. And we're, I mean, we're,
[01:12:48] we're not done operating by any stretch because we get a bunch more operations. But it was definitely winding
[01:12:53] down at that point. Yeah. We had to start thinking about redeployment. Yeah. And, uh, I mean,
[01:13:01] we're all packed up. I remember because we weren't out at, uh, at a regular anymore. Yeah. We had
[01:13:07] guys that were, you were one of the guys that had come back from Craig Doris. We started trying to
[01:13:11] filter guys back. I was solid. So mad at it. Come back. You know, I think about every day when I
[01:13:16] filled this finger, because like, you know, I cut my finger down to the bone. And, uh, they actually had to
[01:13:22] cause back me out, uh, to go get surgery on my finger because I thought I was going to lose it. Because
[01:13:28] we tried to work on it across the street at the aid station, which those guys are phenomenal,
[01:13:32] combat medics over there. And when they were like, dude, we need a bird for you. You're going to lose your
[01:13:37] finger, um, the multiple-tune commander and the badger were like, dude, we out. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:43] You know, so I went back, wrapped some gear. And, um, yeah, I feel that every day.
[01:13:53] Well, just hard, um, like that was the only op I wasn't on. You know, every time we went out,
[01:13:59] I was set a group prayer for the guys. It didn't matter if it was like, hey, we have to go
[01:14:03] right now. The hospital didn't come under or the badger or somewhere to that, hey, we got to get
[01:14:07] JP real quick. And I'd say a group prayer and we'd roll. And that was the only one that I wasn't
[01:14:12] a part of. And, uh, you know, my IQ was my ADUP Gunner. You know, he was always next me when I was
[01:14:19] doing my sniper overwatches. And he was next me when I was rocking point, you know, because you need
[01:14:25] to ADUP Gunner. And JP might have gotten a little crazy towards the last half of the deployment and
[01:14:29] started to walk in point with 300 win mag. And my IQ was there. And I wasn't there, you know. And
[01:14:35] I don't know. So, well, the good news is you got to go home with them. Yes, yeah, got to
[01:14:48] escort his body home. Which was, unlike anything else, you know, you're like, cool. You know,
[01:14:59] you get to be a part of that. But also the same time, you like, this is really shitty to be a part
[01:15:04] of, you know what I mean? I don't know. It was like, yeah, I wanted to be there and make sure everything
[01:15:09] went well. And I just remember us flying back and just just staring at the flag over his coffin,
[01:15:17] you know. And some guys would, you know, lay next to the casket. We lean up against it.
[01:15:23] Yeah, it was just getting bring him home was important to be a part of that. But, you know,
[01:15:36] everybody felt so much guilt. And we all try to keep each other accountable on that. You know,
[01:15:43] it's like, amen. This is a war. You know, Mike, you saved a lot of lives. You know. And we made an impact
[01:15:51] over there. And so it wasn't like it was for nothing. And what he did, I mean, the guy's lives that he
[01:15:59] saved, they all now have families and kids, you know, a couple of them had kids. Mike had the
[01:16:07] easy out. And just like he always did, he never took the easy road. He took the harder road. The road
[01:16:15] that would actually make a difference. And this time was a life of those, of those guys around him.
[01:16:21] And it was just the ride back. I mean, you just think about all that. And yeah, it was also kind of a
[01:16:31] blur as well. You know, like I remember, you know, just like just rubbing the flag, you know.
[01:16:39] The flag's always been very important to me. I remember graduating how we can just sing the
[01:16:44] flag fly and then you hear it in the national anthem. And just sing it over one of your boy's
[01:16:52] caskets was just brought a new level of connection and love for that amazing flag that we have.
[01:17:00] And I sure, I just out there. I just would just rub the flag, just rub it, you know, because I had
[01:17:07] flags that I carried with me on every deployment, every mission. I still do that sometimes. Like my
[01:17:12] wife Amanda will just I'll be doing something and I'll find a flag and I'll just kind of rub it.
[01:17:19] And she's like she knows, you know, she's like that's like my little trigger, you know, I'm just
[01:17:23] my trigger point. I'm just, I just started thinking about things again. And you know, I've taught my kids
[01:17:31] Aiden, Korra and Nola to love and respect the flag. Like whenever they see a flag, they're like
[01:17:39] Daddy, Daddy, it's your favorite thing. Daddy is Daddy's favorite thing, you know, they love
[01:17:44] getting American flag t-shirts and shorts. They saw some American flag cowboy boots. Of course,
[01:17:50] my daughters want those now. And I've been honest with my kids, you know, my boy Aiden, I call my
[01:17:57] bonus boy. He's my stepson, I love him just like mine. You know, he asked me about the flag and
[01:18:04] why is it so important to me. And I told him, I'm like, you know, it was it's been draped over a lot of
[01:18:09] caskets of my buddies that didn't make it home that were killed overseas. He's such a special kid.
[01:18:15] He was just like, that makes sense. And, you know, he just he's a flag and I explained to him why
[01:18:22] flags at half mass. And he's even said, hey, I'm sorry, that flags at half mass. I can't
[01:18:28] he doesn't know why, but he knows something happened. And he knows what it does to me and guys like you,
[01:18:33] whatever, the flags at half mass something horrible has happened. And he knows that. You know, and so
[01:18:40] I just remember, you know, we, I think he went to bestead Bethesda and then we continued on to San Diego.
[01:18:51] And just tried to mentally reset for a couple of days, you know, your back in San Diego.
[01:18:56] So it's awesome, but it just didn't, you know, because you knew you're waiting to receive your
[01:19:05] one of your boys' bodies, you know. So it didn't matter where we were. It didn't matter where
[01:19:11] in San Diego. Like, we didn't want to be in San Diego. We want to be back overseas, still, you know.
[01:19:20] And when we went to Habanía to put him on the bird. And
[01:19:32] he was open. Yeah. And we were just finally in by. And I remember you were ahead of me. We're
[01:19:57] walking into like a mil van. It wasn't like a one way thing. It was a cold mil van. It's a cold mil van.
[01:20:04] And you were ahead of me. You were one, you're literally right ahead of me. And you walked in.
[01:20:13] And you know, you, you, you know, you took your last look at Mikey, you put your hand on the
[01:20:18] on the casket. And you turned around and I was right, you know, we were just looking at each other.
[01:20:26] And when I saw your face, the looking your face, I was, I felt super worried
[01:20:48] about you because I could tell that you were tore up. And I said to myself, hey, man,
[01:21:01] Jaco, you need to get your fucking game together right now and be strong.
[01:21:05] And you were. And that's what we needed. And guys like the Delta Platoon Commander,
[01:21:19] super, super strong for us. But you saw them. I mean, everybody's hurting, you know, it was,
[01:21:24] you know, that deployment you can't not be close with somebody, you know, and especially someone
[01:21:28] like Mikey, man, like he, he knows I liked my sleep. And so he would make sure I didn't get my sleep.
[01:21:36] Just because Mikey didn't sleep. And we were, you know, we were everyone's right next to each other.
[01:21:42] You know, I was back in this corner, he was over in this other corner. There's a sheet of
[01:21:45] plywood between the two of us. And you know, he was always like, what's up homes? He's like,
[01:21:50] okay, homes is sleeping. I'm like, yeah, I'm trying to homes. He's like, he's like cool. He'd open up the
[01:21:58] tarp, you know, the little candy, you know, tarp that I had over for my door and just come in and
[01:22:04] sound the edge of the bed. I'm like, what's up, buddy? He's like, nothing. Just want, you know,
[01:22:10] he just talked about family stuff and you could tell that was always on his mind. You know,
[01:22:15] and he's like, hey, you want to watch the newest episode of thirsty traveler? All right,
[01:22:22] that means a thirsty traveler. I was like, no, but I'm awake. So I guess we're going to watch
[01:22:27] the thirsty traveler because there's a couple times where I play a cable. I'm trying to sleep,
[01:22:32] like, just go do your own thing, you know what I mean? And he had a little hole that he carved into
[01:22:36] the plywood between our rooms. And he would crack Kim lights and push them through. They'd fall
[01:22:43] right next to where I was sleeping. You know, I'm like, I'm going to sprinkle this guy,
[01:22:47] but it was my boy, my key, you know? Like, it was my boy. You know, we were close in the
[01:22:53] work up. And then obviously, you know, we should ride three bikes together. And anyway, so deployment
[01:23:00] he was just fun. I just, I say all that said, is he did that with everybody? Yeah. It was hard
[01:23:05] not to be close to him. It was, you know, there's a different connection when you're at,
[01:23:10] when you're legitimately at in war with your boys. You know, that's why all the army and marine
[01:23:16] guys that we've served with, like, in time I see, I still see some of them once in a while. I randomly
[01:23:21] ran into one of them up in Ohio. And I was just like, dude. And I just, I was up there on a
[01:23:27] cell strip and I just ditched myself, same guys. You know, because I wanted to hang out with them,
[01:23:31] you know, I just, and there's been other trips where I, same thing, another one, my boy Nick
[01:23:35] Hobbs, you know, ran into him. I was with my cell steam and I was like, come on, you know, it's just,
[01:23:40] just that connection is just, it's hard to explain. I mean, you guys know how it is doing
[01:23:43] you just to combat sports where you're wrong with guys and you, you legitimately, you're helping
[01:23:47] guys cut weight and just all this stuff. Like, there's that bond in that connection.
[01:23:52] Take that times up by a thousand and then add some more and that's the connection you get with
[01:23:58] these boys and calm that. So it's just real hard. I mean, in part of it is, that's just who I am.
[01:24:04] Like, I, I remember my heart and my sleeve. I just connect and attach to people very closely and,
[01:24:09] you know, my key is just, it was, it was really hard and that's the look that I saw in your face.
[01:24:16] That's the look that I saw in your face. I was like, and I know, I mean, obviously, I know what
[01:24:21] kind of personality you have. I knew what kind of personality you have and I saw that look of
[01:24:26] devastation. And it was the first time because we'd been together. I mean, we, we were, we heard the news.
[01:24:31] We, you know, but it was the first time that I saw your, your look, where it was almost like that
[01:24:35] was the first time that you really realized that Mike, he was gone. That was it. Yeah. I'm right
[01:24:41] around. But no, I'm the look in your face. I was like, okay, he is, he is devastated right now.
[01:24:49] And that's what I thought to myself. And again, I mean, I, I don't, I saw you as my little brother.
[01:24:56] I mean, for sure, I don't mean that in any kind of derogatory way in any sense. But I literally saw
[01:25:02] you as like my blood, little brother. Yeah. And so to see you just devastated like that.
[01:25:08] And I knew that you were looking at me like, well, okay, what's Jocco gonna do? And I knew that
[01:25:12] I knew what I had to do was I had to show like, listen, this is what we do. This is who we are.
[01:25:18] Get your shit together, Jocco. And, and handle this. And, not saying I didn't, you know,
[01:25:25] I'm not saying I was a robot. But I knew that I had to maintain strength. You have to
[01:25:33] define that so that you guys could go, all right, we're gonna be okay. What have we, what's been
[01:25:41] pounded in termine since, but when the fight, like, if you're gonna fight, when the fight,
[01:25:47] when the fire fight, right? And right then that our fight was, you had to keep the guys together.
[01:25:52] You know, that's why I thought it was self-adbuddied, right? You get shot, you get hurt,
[01:25:56] you take care of yourselves because if you're in a firefight, your boys are going to win the
[01:26:00] firefight first before they can take care of you. That's just part of it. That's how we operate.
[01:26:06] And you had to do that. You know, I mean, that you're in that highest leadership position,
[01:26:14] you just, and the same thing, like, I had to get myself together, you know, just because
[01:26:18] other guys in the boutune, like, I thought, I really felt like they looked up to me as well. And,
[01:26:23] you know, especially after that deployment, you know, I just, you had to keep yourself together, you know,
[01:26:28] I was just, it's just a weird, weird situation, you know, I was first time I ever experienced that,
[01:26:33] you know, at that level. So,
[01:26:39] no, and then, you know, obviously, Mike is feeling what you were at. I obviously wasn't there
[01:26:47] because like you said, we were still, you know, most of us were still in Iraq. Yeah. And had to
[01:26:52] had to finish out the deployment and do the turnover with the guys that were coming in from team five.
[01:26:58] And, you know, that was another thing was just, you know, I mean, I talked about all the time, like,
[01:27:04] even when we were talking prior to recording today, you know, I was like, hey, this is,
[01:27:09] this is kind of blurry to me. Like, I was asking you who went home with you. I mean, I was, like,
[01:27:15] okay, you know, these guys are gone. Okay, here's what I got to do that and focus on the next thing. I, like,
[01:27:20] couldn't get dragged down or think about that anymore because I had to, like you said, I had to do my
[01:27:25] work, I had to do my job. And, you know, I think that's the good thing is for guys that were
[01:27:32] able to go to the funeral and everything. It's like, you get to get to get that, like,
[01:27:36] bit of closure. Yeah. Well, a lot of, you know, the guys that were still over there, we were just,
[01:27:40] we didn't get that. You know, until we got home, yeah, we got home. And, you know, get to go see
[01:27:44] Mike, he's grave and, and meet with his family and get to know his family and get to be together,
[01:27:51] again, as a, as a trooping. So, all those things are kind of how you, you, you, you go from that
[01:27:57] anguish. Yeah. Well, I should say for me, the buried anguish of, you know, that you have to vary
[01:28:04] on deployment when you get home, you go, okay. Now, we can get this stuff out and discuss it. And at least,
[01:28:11] maybe not discuss it. I don't need to say anything to you, JP. I don't need to talk to you about it.
[01:28:15] You know, I know, but we can, we can settle it, you know, and I think when guys don't do that,
[01:28:22] when guys don't think about it, when they keep it buried all the time, that's when it can be
[01:28:28] really problematic is, you know, you, you got to, you got to, you got to face the fact and you
[01:28:34] got to be okay with it, eventually that, hey, this is what happened. Yeah. And, you know, when we're
[01:28:40] talking about like, who's, I guess you could say, you know, who's to blame? And I told this to
[01:28:47] multiple people. Matter of fact, I told everybody, you want to blame somebody? You blame the
[01:28:53] fucking moust. Yeah. They're the ones that did this. Absolutely. Yeah. That's what happened. Yeah.
[01:28:58] And what we're going to do is concl more of them. Continue to go kill more of them. Yeah.
[01:29:02] Yeah. So that deployment obviously was a, was a, was a game changer for us, for a huge impact
[01:29:16] on our lives and, and, you know, everything really that we're doing to this day. And you,
[01:29:22] you got home, I moved over to, you know, take over the training command there. You started another
[01:29:28] work up, but you got hurt. Yeah. So, you know, I was just, the desert, a smoked, you know, just,
[01:29:36] you know, come home flat deployment, you know, initially just still kind of messed up. We're not
[01:29:40] still kind of, I was messed up with the whole Mikey thing. I remember I went and told Yarbara
[01:29:44] was a cat. I just want to go pick on like just let me reset. He's like, okay. And then he, he knows.
[01:29:51] And he knows me. He's like, all right, cool. Yeah. Roger that knowing that's not what he's going to
[01:29:56] do. And I'm driving back up to Sacramento on leave. He's like, hey, I know you said you want to go to
[01:30:02] pick on, but yeah, we need to get after it again. So you're going to go that rack again. Or
[01:30:09] our possibly have cast hand. I was like, get Roger that. Yeah, I don't even know why I said that.
[01:30:14] You know, like it was just as long as things were just like, you know, no good to be
[01:30:18] pick on. Go to Thailand. Stay in Delta, too. No, they switched it all up. So I remember that, but they
[01:30:23] were so surprised that stayed there. Yeah. So no, I was going to be. I'll for a problem too.
[01:30:30] So after our deployment with TU Ruser, they took it instead of keeping it together, because
[01:30:37] there was all this experience in this two-partons instead of keeping it together, they just split
[01:30:42] everybody apart in a different pattern. So other patterns would have these guys in their
[01:30:46] patterns with a ton of combat experience. Guided pest. Yeah, everyone was pest. Like, super
[01:30:51] pest. Yeah. So we start work up. And my shoulder out of joint, all right, one.
[01:30:59] I was a bad one. Not like I'd done that multiple times before. Like, I mean, we're out at
[01:31:03] Nylon. You know, doing our desert warfare, getting it on. And my shoulder came out and I just
[01:31:08] relocate the shoulder. And you know, so I cut off a little bit and keep going. And this was a bad one.
[01:31:13] And so, ended up having to have surgery. That's all right, cool. You know, you have surgery. You'll
[01:31:18] miss a little bit of work up. But, you know, we'll catch it up and we'll get going. And when I had surgery,
[01:31:23] they punctured my break on nerve or did some damage to it. So I would actually drop stuff.
[01:31:29] And, um, that can't be an activity. You put it on when you're dropping stuff. You know, randomly,
[01:31:35] because I was at rehab. And I just, I couldn't grab on to stuff or I would just drop stuff.
[01:31:40] So then they pulled me. And I went to Buds. Um, for a little bit as an endoc Instructor.
[01:31:47] And, um, a good time over there. Learned a lot about, you know, just professionalism and,
[01:31:56] you know, things change and evolve and, you know, um, so when I was a trade-up with you guys,
[01:32:02] and, um, you and, uh, Z, you guys pulled me over there. And it was awesome. You know,
[01:32:08] stepped into, uh, assaults. And then we're doing all the CCC and Error warfare training. And
[01:32:14] trade-it was awesome. You know, I'm working for you again, which is, I'm like, yes, we're getting
[01:32:20] after as it should be. Yes, absolutely. And, um, I learned a lot at trade-it about
[01:32:28] good leadership and bad leadership. You know, there's some guys that trade it, um, that
[01:32:32] hadn't really done anything. And, Jocco was pushing those guys out of there. Not in a bad way,
[01:32:38] but just like, hey man, like, you're not gonna, you know, the war's really being gone on for a while.
[01:32:44] Training, you know, combat is getting intense. Training needs to be intense. And it needs to come
[01:32:49] from guys that actually have experience. Or are willing to listen to the guys that have the experience
[01:32:55] and apply that, you know. And so you really shaped and changed the platform of training for all the
[01:33:01] West Coast seal teams. And so I was super proud to be a part of that. And, um, I learned a lot
[01:33:05] about leadership and growth. You know, I learned good bosses and bad bosses. And, um, actually
[01:33:11] ended up becoming the LPO for, for, for, out. Well, I guess it's now called South, you know,
[01:33:15] Siren, all the urban warfare training for a year. And that was awesome. I got to learn
[01:33:19] actually how to work with guys and actually manage guys, you know, effectively like, and, um,
[01:33:25] which, it's funny, you know, you get on the outside and you're like, man, what you're doing
[01:33:30] the outside is no big deal, you know, compared to the teams where you're like, and charge with like
[01:33:33] 100 plus role players and 17 instructors and logistics for travel and hotel and make sure all the
[01:33:39] training is set up and managing the guys that Nubi talking with the other units that we're talking
[01:33:43] to and at this time, I'm still only 24, you know, maybe 25, I don't think that goes 25.
[01:33:51] Oh, no, it was 25, you know. And maybe. And, uh, so I just learned a lot about that and, um,
[01:33:58] that was pretty cool. And then, uh, I spent a lot of time at CCC, which every good team guy loves,
[01:34:04] or urban warfare, land warfare, and CCC, you know, and, um, you know, I had some really good bosses over there
[01:34:12] as well. And my boy, Chuckie, he still ends all, respect his name as well. We actually lived together
[01:34:20] and I worked for him. And that was a huge lesson of, you know, which we all have in the teams
[01:34:28] is balancing personal and professional because the teams are very tight, you know, you go out and
[01:34:32] drinking with your bosses, hang out with them and then, uh, work the next day. But different when
[01:34:37] you're living with somebody. And, um, man, I was late for work when they were on the road. And I was
[01:34:44] like, I came out and run a little late. He's like, better not be late, you know. Something's long
[01:34:49] of those lines. So I get there. Like a minute late, right? Dude, I had a bomb like restriction.
[01:34:58] Not like really fallen restriction like military thanks about it, but it was like,
[01:35:02] he was like, yeah, he's got to do this. The base I was, uh, or go to you guy where I got to do all the
[01:35:08] work, you know. And, and it was good though, you know, he is, I expected that of him. Like I knew,
[01:35:14] like I made a mistake. I got to pay the man and he, you know, I put him in a heart position,
[01:35:19] you know, which was unfair to him. And, you know, you can't be doing that to your boys, you know,
[01:35:25] like you can't take advantage of like, oh, my buddies, my boss, I can do this. No, my buddies,
[01:35:28] my boss, I'm going to work even harder for him. And, you know, that's what, yeah, I was again,
[01:35:35] well upset with myself. And, yeah, there's a couple of times like he had asked me down and we just
[01:35:39] talk, he said, come in, you know, he can't be doing this stuff. He need to be focused on this. And,
[01:35:44] he really helped with my professional development, you know, really helped him, helped me learn a lot
[01:35:49] of stuff that I was able to apply to the outside and be successful. And, you know, he's still a great
[01:35:55] friend of mine. He's got a beautiful family and it's just, it's awesome seeing him grow over the years.
[01:36:01] It's still kicking ass into the team. He's a legit boss. Like the guy,
[01:36:06] top of the guy is like, I really want to work for him, you know, and so I just took a lot of the
[01:36:10] stuff that I learned from him and I've applied it to the outside and it's been awesome.
[01:36:15] And you, I mean, you ended up on your outside because you made this decision to, to get out.
[01:36:20] Yeah. And I'm a Quitter. Yeah, the joke is in the seal teams. If, you know, no matter what you've
[01:36:28] done or how long you've been in for, if you ever get out of the seal teams, you're a Quitter.
[01:36:32] So, that's what they tell you. So, you decide to get out a bit, pretty much based on your
[01:36:40] family, right? Yeah, I got out. You know, I'd already had a failed marriage. You know, I have a son,
[01:36:47] a tear and California that I'll ever get to see because his mom is awesome. And, um, you know,
[01:36:54] I'm at Amanda and just, I mean, she's the love of my life. She's amazing. She deals with me and
[01:37:01] deals with me very well. I give her big props for that. Absolutely. Nice work Amanda. Yeah, she's, you know,
[01:37:08] you watched me be 300, you know, the queen. Yeah, that's her, right, 100%. You know,
[01:37:13] and, um, you know, she was going to move to San Diego with, uh, with Adon. I was super fired up
[01:37:19] about that and then, uh, she was pregnant. I'm like, okay, cool. I'm still still, still happening and then
[01:37:25] pregnant with twins. She's like, er, nope. I'm not leaving a mom and my support group.
[01:37:32] I remember I was so mad and it caused a lot of issues because I held onto that anger longer than I
[01:37:37] should have. You know, and, um, I just so angry and upset, but now that I look at it, you know,
[01:37:42] she's a small town Mississippi girl. Yeah. I mean, she'd gorgeous, you know, she's awesome,
[01:37:48] but she's a small town girl and, you know, sometimes we're back home, she'll be driving, just like,
[01:37:52] how you can drive, you know, because she doesn't want to drive in the traffic on, you know, the road,
[01:37:56] the main road. I think about that. I'm like, that's like no traffic here in San Diego. So it
[01:38:02] wouldn't have been fair. And then all of a sudden, it's like, for me to expect her to move to San Diego
[01:38:06] with Aiden and, hey, you know, I'm taking him away from his dad, so that wasn't really fair.
[01:38:12] Yeah. And I could relate to that. And, you know, her parents are awesome. So then also in
[01:38:19] her friends, you know, she should get support group and it's like, you know, I was just like, man,
[01:38:25] and a couple of things didn't work out when I had screened, you know, I had another surgery
[01:38:30] when I was out. Yeah, I just took it as, hey, you know, this is maybe the time I need to move on.
[01:38:34] It's a good chapter in my life. An amazing chapter that I'll never forget and it's very important
[01:38:38] who helped mold me as a man. But I absolutely was not going, I was not going to be there for
[01:38:45] Amanda and the kids, you know. And so I got out and there's a lot of guys are upset about that in the
[01:38:51] teams, you know, and don't be. Yeah, you and a couple of other guys. A couple of guys are still active,
[01:38:58] you know, but, um, it's like I got out and, um, there's a rough transition. You go from
[01:39:05] I'm born and raised in Sacramento, California and lived in San Diego, my whole life or I mean,
[01:39:12] I'm sorry, lived in San Diego the whole time in the Navy. And then I'm in North Mississippi.
[01:39:19] Yeah, awesome. Just I just, man, you talk about culture shock. It's cool to go visit, you know,
[01:39:26] I used to always love when we go out there for work, but you're leaving after two weeks. And now
[01:39:31] all of a sudden I'm living there. And it was just nothing bad with the South or where I live. It just
[01:39:36] for me, it was a huge change. And I go from being a seal to now I'm doing sales at a financial job,
[01:39:44] a financial company, which of course I get after it because you have to provide for your family,
[01:39:50] but just the transition and I made the mistake of not reaching out to people and asking and helping,
[01:39:56] you know, maybe like, um, one of my boys is still in, Lowe's, you know,
[01:40:01] goodbye his little nickname. I did reach out to him a couple of times and he was real solid.
[01:40:05] He would reach out to me. But I came out and how you doing? How was J.P. really doing? You know,
[01:40:11] and I talked about stuff, he was like, man, that's not good, bro. Like we need to, you know,
[01:40:15] whatever. And there's times where he's like, all right, well, you know, you just know what you need to
[01:40:18] do. And, you know, Chuck E. Same thing, Chuck E would reach out to me as well and he'd come out there
[01:40:23] for training and he'd come over and hang out with the family and the kids, you know, he's my boy, you know.
[01:40:28] And so I found a gym and a new MMA gym was opened up like right around the corner from the house.
[01:40:34] And I was like, boom, yes, you know what I mean? And came really close with a couple of guys,
[01:40:42] Jake and Zach under what they're actually from Union City, same city, Aaron Vaughn was born and raised in.
[01:40:47] So they already knew about him and I didn't tell him what I did, you know, they had no idea what I did.
[01:40:54] And so, yeah, they're like, you know, city, I was like, oh, I know Aaron Vaughn and they're like,
[01:40:59] how, how do you know, Aaron Vaughn? I'm like, are you so working together like,
[01:41:04] what do you mean you're so worked with them? You know, and I told him like, what, oh, cool.
[01:41:08] And, you know, a couple other fighters from a gym, Joe Pass, Andy and Teddy, like just bump voice,
[01:41:14] you know, like out there, they became like, they became my team guy buddies out there, like they're cut from the same cloth as us,
[01:41:19] you know, and just down to earth guys that, with Jimmy, always, they have my back out there. And they,
[01:41:25] it was weird because I never really explained much to them about my time and the teams, but they knew us having a hard time transitioning.
[01:41:32] And they were just there for me, you know, they just there at the gym, they'd push me to my limits,
[01:41:36] you know, they're like, hey, you're gonna start fighting. I'm like, awesome. You know, and so, you know,
[01:41:40] have seven amateur MMA fights and just a challenge of cutting weight and just training with the boys and sparring him.
[01:41:49] You know, I do it as a stress reliever, which is funny, you know, because like you watch some of my YouTube videos
[01:41:54] and the analysis is like, yeah, and Jeremiah Patrick says he trains as a stress reliever. That's unique.
[01:42:01] Like they don't know how to like, you know, they don't have a reaction because everyone else is like,
[01:42:04] I want to be the next USC champion and I had a horrible life and I hate my parents and I'm just, you know,
[01:42:10] I'm like, yeah, I have an awesome life. I make really good money and I just want to have a little
[01:42:16] stress reliever, you know, it's funny, you know, like, you know, I wasn't fighting to turn pro because I need to make money.
[01:42:22] I was just like, there's a lot of stress reliever. And it was being around guys that were like
[01:42:27] mind is fighting. Yes, there's fighting is fun. And sometimes when you can't get a machine gun to fight with,
[01:42:33] it's fun to fight with your fist. Yeah. And it's fun. You know, it's it's in your, it's in your
[01:42:39] parts party or instinct as a human. Yeah. No, it should be. Well, yeah, it's not. Yeah. I guess,
[01:42:45] I guess for some people it's not, but for the people that I know it's part of their instinct as a human
[01:42:50] is you should be able to defend yourself. You want to be able to fight, you know, you should.
[01:42:54] I mean, you watch little kids, little six year old seven year old kids after you bring any random
[01:42:59] six year old or seven year old boy into a jujitsu place and put them on a room with padded walls and
[01:43:05] padded floor and you say do whatever you want they're going to end up attacking each other. That's the
[01:43:09] way it works. That was my daughter's like, I got on my jujitsu two weeks before they turned three.
[01:43:14] Nice. As most of the owners of German, Joel, he's a former team one guy. He's a part owner of the
[01:43:20] gym. He's a five time world champion. And I believe it's ghee four time world champion, no ghee.
[01:43:26] I don't think he's had one point scored on him in the last five years. Yes, I saw it. Just bringing
[01:43:31] the team guy reputation into jujitsu world. You know, that's it. Just tell us it. Joel,
[01:43:38] Gingery. I don't know. Team one. He's so solid. How old is he's 50 something? How
[01:43:44] how do I know him? He must have been the teams are the same. I mean, I was at team one for like eight
[01:43:50] years. Maybe it's when you went to the East Coast. I don't know. Anyway, super solid guy. I remember
[01:43:55] you when you started when you started fighting. Yeah. And you were like, I'm going to fight. You
[01:44:01] know, because you said me text too. Yeah. You said me a text like, I'm going to, I'm starting to train.
[01:44:06] And then like a month later you're like, dude, I'm I'm getting into it. And then a month later you're like,
[01:44:10] bro, I can't believe I did train with you all the time. Because you guys are trained in this
[01:44:14] list. But like, I'll train with anybody any time. And you would train with me like once a month
[01:44:19] when you could have been training with me seven days a week. I was furious. I was, I was, I was laughing
[01:44:25] inside and I was also pissed and I was like, I tell people that. Oh my god. So I basically
[01:44:30] could have been doing a Jitu since 2005. Yeah. Jocco. Yeah. And people like, what? I'm like, I could have,
[01:44:37] but you know, I just, I guess I never really got the like the taste like I like to stand. I don't know.
[01:44:43] I'm an idiot. That's why I did an episode. You know, actually, and then get yourself, you called yourself
[01:44:47] an idiot when you were talking about your youth before. And I realized that when I bring
[01:44:53] team guys on here, when they talk about like their past, the term idiot comes up all the time. I know
[01:44:58] I do it all by my calls and idiot. Yeah. And Tony's like, I was an idiot. It's just like classic,
[01:45:04] you know. You know, I mean, like, and then when I tell people like, yeah, you know, since 2005,
[01:45:08] Jocco could have been rolling in training all the time. And then when you opened your gym,
[01:45:12] you know, guys like echo and his brother and do you list her and you know, I was there. But I was
[01:45:17] always doing the stand up stuff. And I was doing Jitu just to do Jitu. I didn't do anything
[01:45:23] in the M. A. Stuff, you know. Now look back at it. Just like, Jitu made me get upset about it. Sometimes,
[01:45:29] I'll tell people like, yeah, and they're like, you're an idiot. You know, like, like, Jocco,
[01:45:34] Dean Lister, and you know, like, just whatever. I mean, hey, everything happens for a reason. I mean,
[01:45:40] I've done pretty well so far. I'm six and one. And, you know, the guys out there are solid.
[01:45:45] Yeah, solid. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I was a week straight last night.
[01:45:48] Yeah, I had done anything like 60 months. Yeah. Yeah. That, that injury went into my last fight.
[01:45:55] You know, my coaches were like, down pulling you. And Joel, dude, he's such a legit badass. Just
[01:46:00] tough. Like, people are terrified of him. But he has the other side that people don't realize
[01:46:05] team guys have where he's like, hey, I'm pulling you from this fight. Like, I can't let you get hurt.
[01:46:09] You know, like the nurturing, like, you got to take care of your boys. Because I went into it with
[01:46:13] a facial fracture from here, done to hear all these teeth are still numb from it. I deviated
[01:46:20] septum crush sinuses and a herniated disc in my neck. What'd you do getting to fight with a bear?
[01:46:26] Yeah, sparring Teddy Holder. Oh, you know, knocked out Chago Silva. Yeah, that's one of my boys in
[01:46:31] Andy, Yuruk, Bellator fighter. I mean, Zach, all these guys. I mean, just they get after it, you know.
[01:46:37] And, um, yeah, I hope they get after a little bit less of your sparring sessions for now on. Yeah, we learned
[01:46:43] that well, and also it was pretty, that's an old school man. I'm telling you now, that is old school.
[01:46:48] You don't need to spar like that. No, we know that. And, you know, in the guys have changed up.
[01:46:52] Yeah, so legitimately changed up because guys were getting knocked out and fights. And, you know,
[01:46:56] we could talk that could be a whole none the podcast, but they get really changed it up.
[01:47:01] And so, but I, you know, when I got the call for that fight, I thought not to
[01:47:07] close before that with this guy, a tough, tough guy. You know, ours was like a grudge match.
[01:47:15] You know, everyone thought we hated each other. And, you know, we just, do we sold so many tickets
[01:47:19] or is insane? Like we each sold over 110 tickets. So you're like, you're like the
[01:47:23] Conner McGregor of Amateur of fighting. The Conner McGregor, Amateur of fighting in the mid-South.
[01:47:27] Yeah, mid-South things. It's like the next big thing. And that's like, you know, and so
[01:47:31] it's something you guys mean that guy Danny Shell, good guy. You know, he's awesome. Dude,
[01:47:38] he really is a really good guy. You know, I mean, we just, we'd get after it on social media just
[01:47:42] to, you know, just because we're born, I guess. But it came down, you know, we had a tough fight,
[01:47:48] you know what I mean? And, you know, I mean, it was, it was awesome. Like you watch it. We're just
[01:47:52] waiting for it. I thought anywhere between 172.205. My first fight, we're going to
[01:47:59] run that right now. Uh, 2015. Yeah. Um, not nice. You, you're not a good two-fifth. I tried to be gentle over
[01:48:06] here. No, that's fine. You don't have to. You know, but my first pass. Yeah, exactly. Hey,
[01:48:12] you used to walk around like in the in the in the in the in the bruiser, you were like 185. No,
[01:48:16] like that was my heaviest. Like I couldn't break 185. Like I was trying to like do like all the body
[01:48:22] building lives. Yeah. Like get his biggest I could. I could never break 185. And then my dad's
[01:48:26] like dude wait until you get your 30s. Like whatever. He's like, oh, okay. Because your body is
[01:48:32] a little legitimately done. Everything mine has that every aging command. And then yeah,
[01:48:36] get big. But my first fight fought at 205. But I only weighed 190. Um, because I was going to fight
[01:48:42] at 185 for my first fight. But, um, that's why I know him. I don't go by Jeremiah now on like social media
[01:48:50] because guys started googling Jeremiah to know, you know, I test fight against Justin and Jerry
[01:48:55] with the whole Chris Kyle thing and whatnot. So you google Jeremiah to know, there's a bunch of
[01:48:58] Navy seals up out there. And so I checked that's why I checked my Facebook page to Jeremiah Patrick
[01:49:03] just because you know, fighters would look that up. I'd like to my coaches were like, they didn't
[01:49:07] want to tell me. I knew there's something weird with Jake and Zach and my dad. Like I knew there
[01:49:13] was something going on. My fighter backed out. Oh, and then they're trying to find like another fighter.
[01:49:18] And then he backed out. I think it was like two or three guys. I had sold on my first fight
[01:49:24] over a hundred tickets also. Like I'd fed I'd people flying in from California driving out like
[01:49:30] like drive for East Coast West Coast, Washington, you know, my ant and alcohol flying out. It's like
[01:49:34] first amateur fight. This is ridiculous, right? Should have just traveled somewhere where this better
[01:49:39] be a good show. Exactly. Well, for Washington. So yeah, exactly. You know, and um, I remember
[01:49:47] telling my buddy Jake, I'm like, dude, I don't care if it's a heavyweight. Get me a fight. Like I
[01:49:51] can't not fight, you know, I mean, like I will find. So I found some good he had a good amount of
[01:49:57] fights already and like he cut down to two or five and I weighed in with your flip flops. Like cut off
[01:50:04] can't be sure. It's all my stuff. My pocket is at 1901. And um, that was awesome. It's good. Good
[01:50:09] to go first fight. Um, got myself way too amped up for it. You know, I should have just gone in.
[01:50:15] That one's on video, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I sent you everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was
[01:50:20] looking at that fight and I'm like, yes, this is the JP that's extremely amped right. Yeah.
[01:50:28] Yeah. Yeah. The finish him in the second fight. Uh, second round. Um, TKO and the second fight.
[01:50:34] Finch that guy on the first round. Uh, third fight. Which was hilarious. I had me as the main event
[01:50:41] on this card for the third fight. That's it. You're getting yourself in a hundred tickets. I know.
[01:50:46] You know, yeah. We're pretty in the main event. Yeah. That's, yeah. Not good for adding just
[01:50:51] unneeded stress. Well, you know what? You know what? No kidding. Like in watching your
[01:50:55] fights and everything. You do have the, I mean, you have this anyways, but you, you have like a level
[01:51:00] of charisma that makes people want to watch you fight because you're just fired up and you have a
[01:51:07] good level charisma. It's like, you know, you're like, I compared you to Connor McGregor jokingly.
[01:51:11] Yeah. But it's a reality. If you watch some of your fights, it's like, yeah, Gekke's in the mid-South
[01:51:16] people going, I want to go watch Jeremiah Dell get after it. Punch him in the fight. Yeah. Like
[01:51:22] this. He should come watch him fights in the South. It's always the tickets, man. I think I can
[01:51:27] get you a ticket, bro. But, you know, the so the fights have been awesome. Uh, my fourth fight, I lost.
[01:51:33] I actually went into that fight ahead. I was in the hospital or the doctors in and out of the doctors,
[01:51:38] almost hospital, like the week prior. Uh, I was cutting out a 170 again also with hand foot mouth
[01:51:45] disease. Is that, is that your method of cutting weight? Get your self-hand foot mouth disease.
[01:51:50] Dude, I would not recommend it at all. Uh, I had to take this medicine to numb my mouth and
[01:51:55] throughout just to drink water. So it did help with cutting weight, except for it was horrible.
[01:52:00] Amanda was legitimately taking care of me like everything. And she's helped. So she preps all my meals,
[01:52:07] you know, come home for the jam and she, you know, we get out. I mean, are you, you think you're
[01:52:11] gonna fight again? Yes. You know, you got to heal up. But yeah, it's been good. Yeah, I've
[01:52:17] looked, I mean, you and you also had a rough, rough, little rough patch with Amanda, right?
[01:52:23] Yeah, yeah, we did. Um, you know, I owe emotional thinking about that sometimes just,
[01:52:32] you know, we're so lucky. What we have. We got a second chance, you know, we actually
[01:52:36] fallen how to divorce, moved out. I had my own house, you know, she was doing her own thing. I was doing
[01:52:42] my own thing. And, um, you know, I just came down a lot of communication, which when I really look
[01:52:49] at it and we both look at it and we were both just being selfish, which, like, I, I tried to think
[01:52:56] that's not me. And with Amanda, like, that's not her. You talk about somebody who's not selfish,
[01:53:01] I hate that's her, like, to an extent, but we just, I don't know. Yeah, well, it's bizarre too. And
[01:53:09] because you, you are, I mean, in the teams, you are obviously extremely selfless. And, but I see
[01:53:18] how these things happen. For whatever reason, with your team guy, bros, it's like, I'll do anything
[01:53:25] for you. And I've had situations with you where I've been like, hey, I need this right now and
[01:53:29] you've been like, I'll be there in three minutes and 30 seconds. And I'm like, okay, cool. You know,
[01:53:34] and, and, but for some reason, guys don't always, guys and girls both don't always do the best
[01:53:41] job of translating that selflessness into that relationship at home. So it happens, but I'm glad that
[01:53:48] you guys were able to kind of, yeah, I'm able to do that. Yeah, like I said, you know, about a year,
[01:53:54] you know, we're doing our own thing. And, you know, we just kept getting drawn back to each other and
[01:54:00] it was a kids. And everyone says, oh, my kids are so smart. Our daughters and Aiden are
[01:54:06] incredibly intelligent. Like, you know, my daughters will be five in January. So this time,
[01:54:12] for them, you know, they're, they're, they're three, you know, and they know what's going on.
[01:54:16] You know, and they're trying to be like, hey, you know, you know, my daughter knows, like,
[01:54:20] well, you know, daddy, if you and mommy didn't argue so much, maybe we could all live together.
[01:54:26] And to hear that from your kids, you know, I was just like, it was rough. It was really hard.
[01:54:34] And you do anything for your kids, you know? So what do you think is the key element that made you go?
[01:54:39] You know what, Jack asks idiot, you need to get in the game here and make this work. Like, what?
[01:54:45] And then what method did you use? Where you said, okay, next time that she does this,
[01:54:50] I'm going to counter instead of attacking or instead of getting defensive, I'm just going to be like,
[01:54:54] all right. So what made me get back in the game is I still loved her. Like, I was just,
[01:55:00] I'm still, you know, head over heels and love with her. And head over and heel and love with
[01:55:05] my kids. And I didn't want somebody else raised my kids and Aiden, you know, like, I would still
[01:55:09] pick him up and take him to school. You know, even though, you know, okay. So there's a pretty
[01:55:15] clear answer, then what did you have to change to make it work when you went back when you said,
[01:55:21] hey, I'm going to, the zoo, in your own mind, what did you do differently? That's made it successful.
[01:55:27] We put each other first, boom. And we learned to communicate, you know, and I was sitting in
[01:55:34] Amanda, you know, I don't know. We both just had like this come to Jesus with somebody, like,
[01:55:38] I can't remember who I was talking to. I don't know who she was talking to. And, you know,
[01:55:44] she's crafty. She's smart. She knows how to deal with me. You're right. So she calls.
[01:55:49] And she knows it's my weekend. It's all obviously she's calling me to talk to the kids. And she's like,
[01:55:54] hey, can I talk to the girls? My, yeah, absolutely. I'm sorry, put on a speaker phone. She's like,
[01:55:57] hey, girls, a lot of you. Hey, girls, do you want daddy to pick me up for a church? So we can all go
[01:56:02] together. Do that was so pissed. And the chorus, the girls, like, yeah, she was like, I was like,
[01:56:09] cool, hey, outside and five minutes, or I'm driving. Still going to keep driving. You know,
[01:56:14] she's waiting outside in this dress. Looks stunning. Just, I was like, all right. And that was at the
[01:56:20] beginning, you know, and then we just learned to communicate with each other and we, we put each other
[01:56:24] first and you know, cover and move exactly. Maybe a lot of cover moves. There's a lot of cover
[01:56:29] move. And we legitimately have to put each other first. Instead of, you know, just doing it as a team,
[01:56:35] like my focus. And I'm, I don't do this all the time on it. Try to act like we have this
[01:56:39] perfect relationship and everything's phenomenal now. But we legitimately try to put each other first
[01:56:44] and almost everything that we do to try to take care of each other. And out of all the arguments that
[01:56:49] we've ever had or anybody else has ever had with their significant other, it was because it was too
[01:56:54] complicated. Something was complicated and messed up. And so we just had to simplify things.
[01:57:01] Let's just go ahead to, you know, law combat number two, exactly. We got one covered. Yeah,
[01:57:07] cover move. Keep things simple. Cover move. Keep things simple. Yeah. And I know what you're
[01:57:10] talking about. You know what that is. That's when you, when you take a look at this argument that you're
[01:57:14] in and you go wait a second. What are we arguing about right now? Oh, we're arguing because I put my
[01:57:19] spaghetti in the microwave before you did. You know what? I'm sorry. Yeah, I'll let you have this
[01:57:26] spaghetti first. Let's simplify because because that little thing of who's using the microwave
[01:57:31] first, all the sudden spirals into you, you know, a major blowout if you're not careful. It's
[01:57:35] over something stupid. I mean, she's an alpha female. I'm an alpha male. So of course,
[01:57:41] we're just like at times we just want to challenge you Tyler, but then we're like,
[01:57:46] no, this is stupid. Yeah. I had an idea instead of challenging each other. Why don't we work together
[01:57:51] and start with the world? I know. That's all. Well, that's our plan right now. We're doing it.
[01:57:56] And then, you know, I mean, and then just legitimately figuring out what it was priorities in our life.
[01:58:02] Like we just had to be so we could be on the same page. Echo, priority or time is execute.
[01:58:07] Boo. Boo. Boo. Yeah. Look at that. And I was, I've talked a couple of different people about this.
[01:58:14] You know, you know, it's awesome that you're saying this because I've heard a bunch of times from
[01:58:18] people that'm like, oh, extreme ownership saved our marriage. But I've never, I've always said,
[01:58:23] cool, thanks. But I've never said like, explain that to me. Yeah. But now you're explaining to me. Yeah.
[01:58:27] And it, it absolutely does. I mean, I always thought they focused on the ownership part,
[01:58:32] meaning, oh, don't worry. Hey, I'm going to take ownership of this. I'm going to, I made a mistake.
[01:58:37] Here's where I'm going to do to fix it. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Yeah. I always thought that that's just what
[01:58:41] they were talking about. But you're going ahead and applying other laws of combat to your marriage and
[01:58:46] making things happen. Yeah. Pretty legit. Yeah. I mean, and, you know, Amanda's the one that, you know,
[01:58:51] just recognize a lot of these, these shortfalls that we're having and would just
[01:58:56] communicate with me and she'd like, hey, if you're upset with me over something, I probably didn't
[01:59:00] mean to do that on purpose. So just let me know. That's good. And so that's simple. Yeah. And so,
[01:59:07] as far as us prioritizing things like we just, you know, and we still, we need to get like an actual
[01:59:14] fall on detailed detailed game plan for what we're doing. But we realized what was important and
[01:59:18] what wasn't important. And some of these certain things like the things that truly weren't
[01:59:23] important, like I don't think twice about it and she doesn't either. And we just focused on
[01:59:29] our goals for her business, my business, raising our kids the right way, trying to be involved in
[01:59:35] the church as much as possible, trying to give back to others like those are our priorities,
[01:59:40] not the stupid like, well, you said you're coming home at 10, but you stayed out drinking while
[01:59:45] with your girlfriend until 11. Who cares? She came home to me. She was relaxing with her girlfriend
[01:59:51] while since I've been gone for three weeks for work. Like, she should have stayed out all night
[01:59:55] and just relax. You know what I mean? Like, hey, how does sleep over at your friend's house?
[01:59:59] So you don't have to wake up to the kids three times during the night. That's what I should have done,
[02:00:02] you know? And she's done the same with me, you know? Like, I was a couple of times where I'm just like
[02:00:07] super stressed out or whatever and she's like, okay, you know, what do we need to do? Like, what do you
[02:00:11] need, she's like, you know what? You need to go workout. I'm like, yeah, but we need to go do this right now.
[02:00:16] And she's like, no, what we need to do is you need to go workout and I can handle this. That's awesome.
[02:00:22] And it's just been awesome. You know, night and day like, I think about it like, dude,
[02:00:26] she's such a hard worker, you know, and she runs everything and then she'll make sure I have a
[02:00:32] cup of coffee like on the nightstand like next me in the morning. So I went up, you know, and it's just like,
[02:00:38] you woke up early to go do that. So now like, I'll try to like do stuff for her or whatever.
[02:00:42] Dude, it's just one awesome one upsmanship. Yeah of kind acts. Right. I don't know. I hope my wife
[02:00:48] doesn't start that game with me. I'll lose. It's it's hard though with her because she is,
[02:00:53] she's so thoughtful and crafty like all of a sudden like, you know, I don't know, she's,
[02:00:58] it's awesome. So life's been good. You know, it's really turned around. I mean, there's a real
[02:01:01] dark time. I'm not gonna lie. Like, there was the divorce was rough, you know, and there's some other
[02:01:08] times before that that was real rough. You know, I was, I was drink a lot, taking painkillers,
[02:01:15] just because I had injuries. Yeah. But I was like, oh, I have an injury so I can take this
[02:01:19] painkiller. Oh, I can take two to three and drink at the same time. I was just trying to
[02:01:24] numb a lot of stuff that was going on, which is not the path to ghost, not the path to all.
[02:01:28] I wouldn't, we know that. And, you know, one of the things, I mean, there's so many things I'm
[02:01:34] pretty sure that I made to help me through, but I remember when I went to the VA because I was having
[02:01:38] a little hard time sleeping and just my body was all on a whack. Turns out I had like, my body wasn't
[02:01:44] producing testosterone anymore. I didn't know that, right? Oh, so I didn't know that, but
[02:01:49] so I go to the VA. I come home with like a bag of like no kidding, like eight different meds
[02:01:54] that they want to me to start taking. I was like, okay. So I take it first time. Like, oh my,
[02:02:00] like, she had like, get me out of bed for me to go to work because I was like a zombie. And it started
[02:02:06] then, like the second day and then that stuff started becoming really addicting. Like, I wanted
[02:02:11] that like numb feeling and she was just like, you're not the same person, like quick, like she
[02:02:18] recognized it. And we got off, like I was able, and I wasn't even on that stuff for like a full week.
[02:02:25] And it was so hard for me not to take it. Like, she had to straight up like how I mean,
[02:02:30] D-talk, like, I'm not saying D-talk's in a bad way, like somebody who's like, but it was bad,
[02:02:34] you know, and she identified that right away. That's the thing. And it was just like, oh, I know.
[02:02:39] And it was just like, nope, like we're flushing this. Like, this is gone. Like, we'll figure something
[02:02:43] else that. And she's always been the one to, you know, figure something else that and make make sure
[02:02:48] we work as a team on it. So it's been awesome, man. She's amazing. That is awesome. Where does this,
[02:02:52] where does all this leave you right now? What do you got going on right now? So, um,
[02:02:56] sorry, my own company called Never Settle Consulting. You know, I did sales in financial
[02:03:00] company for a while. Uh, a lot of good relationships. My sales team was awesome. Uh,
[02:03:06] but I want to do my own thing. Um, I wanted a little more fulfillment. It was taking a time away
[02:03:11] from me being able to do what I wanted to do to be able to grow and, you know, spend more time with my family.
[02:03:18] Um, because I had a second chance, you know, a second chance with Amanda and with my kids and I,
[02:03:22] I wanted to do something that fulfilled me that would help us grow. You know, so I started
[02:03:28] never settle consulting teaching tactics, combatants, and shooting to law enforcement,
[02:03:33] uh, trying to work out some stuff with some smaller military units and groups and, uh,
[02:03:38] for private civilian groups as well and, uh, able to incorporate leadership and sales team building events
[02:03:45] into that, you know, just doing what I love. Like, what I'm, um, decently good at, you know, as
[02:03:50] well. And so, how do a couple of buddies who's that, hey, I need a second instructor for this,
[02:03:55] you know, so I helped teach a long-range shooting course for NRR outdoors and then taught a
[02:03:59] carbine course for them as well. Um, so it's, it's been good, you know, it ties up and down. You know,
[02:04:06] I've worked with a couple clients that I thought was going to be a long-term thing and it didn't, but,
[02:04:11] hey, it's business, you're out on your own, you learn your lessons, you just keep moving forward them.
[02:04:16] You know, a lot of people like, why, why never settle? Like, they're like, I get it. It's awesome.
[02:04:19] And I was like, well, I just miss being in the sealed teams. You know, I miss being around guys that
[02:04:23] for the most part, legitimately, did not settle with average or, you know, a mediocre lifestyle.
[02:04:31] Like, you just didn't happen. You know, you're always constantly driving and pushing you
[02:04:35] each other to be better, to be stronger, to be faster, to be smarter, you know, I remember multiple
[02:04:40] times like you would come in to, hey, if you ever heard this website, I'm like, no, you're like,
[02:04:45] you need to start reading it every morning. I'm like, okay, so I go in and I'd print off the articles
[02:04:50] and I read them and highlight them and chocolate later on. He's like, hey, you hear about this? Like,
[02:04:54] yeah, actually, boom. Yeah, and so, you know, I just miss being around that, you know, and that's not
[02:04:59] in the, for the most part, you don't find that in civilian life outside, you know, in business. You don't.
[02:05:05] And I really wanted to be able to have an impact, like I want to work with veterans that have
[02:05:10] issues that are going through problems. I want to give back to law enforcement, you know, because
[02:05:16] they have a hard job, man, and they're underfunded, they're under trained. And I just, I wanted
[02:05:23] to give back, you know, and I enjoy that. I like doing that stuff. And it gives me freedom to be able
[02:05:29] to choose, you know, to help out with different projects and help people, and, you know, a man has
[02:05:32] been super supportive, and, you know, the other logo of Navarretutals, win the fight.
[02:05:39] No matter what, you just win the fight, and it's not a physical thing. It's life is a fight.
[02:05:44] We all go through our fights. We just have to establish what we want, like you talk about,
[02:05:49] the commanders intent. Like, if you don't have your own commanders intent for you and your family,
[02:05:53] you're screwed. You're going to wander around, and you're just going to waste your life away.
[02:05:58] And so I just, you know, and then under it is, in Latin, you know, signed met to,
[02:06:04] which means without fear. You know, fear is the opposite of faith. Like you read about Mikey, you know,
[02:06:09] you know, fear is no match for my faith. And I believe that. And I want others to believe that.
[02:06:18] I don't think a lot of people out there believe that. And if we can paint that message, and
[02:06:23] I would love, you know, for my company to be more of like a lifestyle, you know,
[02:06:27] and did some do went and got my logo tattooed on his calf. Because he's like, I wanted to be a
[02:06:32] reminder, and he would incorporate his kids names into the tattoo. He's like, dude, it's a daily
[02:06:36] reminder for me, not just settle for average and just get after it. And I'm like, all right,
[02:06:40] I'm doing something right. Hopefully, you know, and so Amanda's super supportive of it, you know,
[02:06:45] and she's just doing everything to help me out with it. And you know, she has her business, and she's
[02:06:49] still takes a time to help me grow mine. So it's awesome. And just helping people figure out what they
[02:06:55] want in life. Like, because I don't think a lot of people will take the time to establish that.
[02:06:59] And, you know, I think if we can help that, and if we can help veterans,
[02:07:04] and if we can help the youth, figure out what they want out of life and where they need to go,
[02:07:11] but I think, you know, we can actually make an impact in this nation. And that's important right now.
[02:07:17] Yeah, there's no doubt about that. And I guess that kind of brings us up to speed for this
[02:07:23] or up to present day with with where JPEs at right now been a pretty good chunk of time.
[02:07:31] And it's probably about good for tonight. And obviously,
[02:07:38] thanks for coming on the podcast. I mean, one of the, one of the best things for me about this podcast
[02:07:45] is that there's heroes like you that people don't know about. And those heroes from the past
[02:07:50] that people don't know about and being able to bring heroes like yourself and heroes from the past
[02:07:56] till the present time and let people know and introduce that there's warriors in the past.
[02:08:03] You need to know about and there's warriors walking with us today that you need to know about.
[02:08:08] And that's one of my favorite things about the podcast is having the opportunity to do that.
[02:08:13] And if, if you like listening to this podcast, we'll guess what?
[02:08:19] I believe echo Charles can tell you how to support the podcast. I have a question.
[02:08:24] Oh, man. Here we go. Hot sea. Why are you going to find you like that?
[02:08:27] I remember, um, I actually, the day I met you long time ago before I actually knew you real good.
[02:08:38] You don't be real good now. Was that new?
[02:08:40] Yeah. Oh, so big.
[02:08:43] But like you, you always, and actually listening to you now, like you kind of, I kind of realized,
[02:08:47] like you live in the moment a lot. Yeah. Yes. Like I remember we were sitting at this
[02:08:51] when we had sushi that night. Yeah. First time at May, you're like, what was that? Like, oh,
[02:08:55] it's just seven or something. 2007. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:08:59] And I remember you and you had another guy with you. I'm about to get it. Yeah, my buddy, um,
[02:09:04] cart. Yeah. And I remember, um, we're all talking about what I, you know, everyone's talking.
[02:09:08] And I hear you kind of on the side you're like, like, this is good, man. You know,
[02:09:12] in sushi with good people, you know, we're doing, you know, kind of like you're totally,
[02:09:17] it's like you're explaining to him, but you're explaining to yourself, like, what, what
[02:09:20] am I experiencing right now? And how good is this? How cool is this? Yeah. Almost like you
[02:09:25] had this stuff coming up and you're, but you're living in that moment. Yeah. There's just like,
[02:09:28] just like with the stories. Oh, like, you mentioned like the, and you saw the ambient light coming
[02:09:33] down. This is awesome. This is awesome. Yeah. What, like, why is that do you think? Or, I mean,
[02:09:38] is there a specific reason to you? Because a lot of people not like that. You know, like,
[02:09:43] there'll be like, oh, we're about to do this. I'm excited or that thing happened and that's,
[02:09:47] that's whack or whatever. Yeah. And they don't really, you know what I mean? I've always been like that,
[02:09:52] you know, my parents taught us to enjoy what you have. You know, it doesn't have to be material stuff,
[02:09:59] just enjoy the life that you have. And I've also always realized that people haven't a lot worse.
[02:10:04] And then after two deployments, you know, because I met you after my second deployment,
[02:10:08] like I'd seen the worst. Like, I'd seen evil firsthand. I'd seen actual oppression, not what some
[02:10:15] of these idiots are talking about right now. You know, I'd seen, you know, kids with underwear on
[02:10:21] and sandals in the streets. And that's all they had. I've seen, you know, women holding their kids
[02:10:28] crying. You know, I've seen guys use kids as human shields because they're cowards. And
[02:10:36] I'm getting to sit and enjoy sushi in San Diego, California with my best friend, Curtis, from
[02:10:42] high school and a new group of guys that I met, you know, through other team guys. And I'm like,
[02:10:48] man, life is good. We were with the kicknuts by the way. Oh, okay. That's making a
[02:10:52] little difference. Yeah. I'm about cast. Yeah. Solid dude. Thank you. Try to rip a tree out of the
[02:10:58] ground once. Probably. He did. Someone convinced and then he could he couldn't pull a tree out of
[02:11:05] the ground. So he tried. Yeah, Jeremy, probably tried it. Come in some of that. I think you're right on that.
[02:11:09] Yeah. Yeah. Really. Also the second thing, what did they find out? Why you, you had like, you weren't
[02:11:16] pretty pretty. Yeah. Just the, the Batutary gland. I'm the sacram, my Batutary gland was damaged and
[02:11:23] just you're pretty bad. From the, from the blast or something. Yeah, from from that blast and just
[02:11:28] multiple other like explosions and blasts overseas. I mean, we used breaching charges that open
[02:11:32] up doors. You know, you were hearing a gunfight in the machine gun is legitimately going on
[02:11:36] to bring this your head. That's providing like, crushing that. There's times after gunfights,
[02:11:40] like I felt like I was just drunk. Yeah. And I felt like I was drunk just because I was just out of
[02:11:45] it. And so just that much and then just combat sports and other stuff like that. And so, um,
[02:11:51] you know, when an anophiling got me to go to the VA to get my levels tested, you know, normal male
[02:11:56] or supposed to be between 600 to 900. I was 81. Yeah. That was bad. And they were just like,
[02:12:04] how, like, they called. I didn't answer my phone because I was at work. And I was on the
[02:12:09] alone or something like that. And they called a man that like, he needs to come back in right away.
[02:12:12] So, of course, they freak my wife out, right? She thinks I'm dying or something like that. Like
[02:12:17] and then so I go and I get it retested again. It was 87. And they're like, are you on steroids right now?
[02:12:24] I'm like, look at me. Like a monster. Now, granted, like when I was younger, you know, I'd
[02:12:29] take in some real strong supplements from like max muscle in different places like that that how
[02:12:33] I'm available. And I'm sure that mine have had an effect, but you know, I don't know. I mean,
[02:12:40] I know. I know. I like, I try to like get, you know, so, oh, not some of them is like, you know,
[02:12:45] because Jocker used to joke is like, JP just wants to be 205 pounds walking around. Yeah,
[02:12:49] nothing wrong with that. Oh, no, I wish I could get down to two of them. But, you know,
[02:12:54] um, so yeah, my levels were really messed up. And they're like, how do you even get out of that? How
[02:12:58] you do this, and this, I'm like, um, oh, I have a family I have to provide for. I really don't have
[02:13:03] another option. So just gotta get out there and get after it. We call that BTA just BTF and
[02:13:08] throughout the day. Yeah, that's crazy. And that's another part. Remember how we talk about where
[02:13:15] that's the part that you don't really hear that much about. Just those little detail like that you say
[02:13:19] in a gunfight if the machine gun is right here. And it hits you. Kind of like someone's hitting
[02:13:23] you physically. You know, it's a shock to your system. Yeah. I mean, I've been, uh, I was actually going
[02:13:29] through some videos and I'll try to get you guys some of these daily day where I'm laying down
[02:13:34] on the sniper rifle and we're in a big firefight and they come and straddle over me to start
[02:13:40] firing off rockets. And I'm getting that blast coming down just crushing me. You know, and then
[02:13:47] my key, you know, right next to me, the A-Dab gun is like, uh, I'm just like, oh my goodness,
[02:13:52] I'm like, like, me coloring grants or Christmas next year is something like, yeah. By the way,
[02:13:57] when you fire a rocket in training, you put on two levels of ear protection. I had none.
[02:14:04] You don't need your prone combat. Your ears naturally squeeze. It's pretty awesome.
[02:14:10] Yeah. Yeah. I remember, um, one of my friends went who went through sniper school too. He
[02:14:16] talked about the, um, I think it was like the 50 kelp. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, brother,
[02:14:21] thing is like, just shooting it is like you're getting punched in the face. Oh, yeah. Just shooting
[02:14:25] it. Yeah. Well, I mean, considering we mount those to the tops of hummers and if you don't have
[02:14:31] your foot on the break and it's in part, it'll move the vehicle and even that, and you see a vehicle
[02:14:36] going to do, like just moving like, and you know, I was also a lead driver. So there's times
[02:14:43] where the machine, like 50 cows right over us in the front, like the barrels like sticking out and
[02:14:46] you're getting that blast, you know, like, oh, I mean, it's just put it's part of it. You know what I mean?
[02:14:51] Like I would not change any of that. Yeah. For crazy. I felt like those details like to, to someone
[02:14:56] who hasn't met, that's kind of a big deal. Because you watch movies and the guy shooting and
[02:15:00] like, reaching across the guy shooting the guy in the street corner and all this stuff. And then
[02:15:04] if you know those details, you're like, whoa, whoa, you skipped over this whole big kind of element
[02:15:09] of this situation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I just, some of you're spec, you know, the guys that are
[02:15:14] still on the team. So you know, I just did under 12 years in the Navy. I didn't, I didn't do my
[02:15:19] full time. You look at these guys. I do 20, 22, 25 years. Like, I'm just like, do the hats off to those
[02:15:27] guys, you know? And like the guys that are still, same guys that I deployed with. You know, it's
[02:15:31] weird me talking about it. Like, I didn't think special, like, as a team we did something special.
[02:15:37] Yeah. And those guys are still in the fight. You know, they're still deploying, they're still doing
[02:15:40] workups. You know, they're battling divorces. They're, you know, dealing with new babies being born and,
[02:15:45] you know, taking care of their wives and your family. And it's just, like, just so much respect to those guys.
[02:15:51] And then you know, you look at all the other branches that we surf with. And with those guys, just
[02:15:56] do 18 month appointments. 18 month appointments. 18 month appointments. Hey, you get to go home for
[02:16:01] two weeks halfway through. Yeah. Guys are going home to like their families move out. Yeah.
[02:16:06] Just go on. Like, not all but I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, a couple of guys came
[02:16:12] home and they came back and from all leaving. I was like, how was it? Is like, oh my wife and
[02:16:16] kids are gone? I don't know where you're my stuff is. I'm like, so Jack, do you want to hug? I don't know
[02:16:22] to do. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it is, you know, JP and I were talking about that earlier. Like,
[02:16:28] like, we're visible. Well, I'm definitely visible. And I was telling JP, like, you will now be
[02:16:37] visible. More visible. I mean, he's been maintained a pretty low profile and trying to, yeah, because
[02:16:42] if you're fighting has a little bit of profile, but like, you know, you're going to be more visible.
[02:16:48] And when you get visible, people automatically think that you're special in some way. And like,
[02:16:55] I'm telling you, there's nothing special here. Definitely not for me because, you know, like,
[02:17:01] like, I did 20 years in the Navy, but okay, great. There's guys that do 30 years that guys that do
[02:17:06] 14 different deployments. There's guys that, you know, get wounded. And then you like JP just said,
[02:17:11] you branch that out to all the services. And you know, I'm another guy and we're just other guys
[02:17:18] where we have a little bit of a of a higher profile. But that's not due to our, you know, anything
[02:17:25] special that we did just just with a way thing shook out of the end. So I always want to make that
[02:17:30] clear. And like law enforcement, they're doing it every day. Like my uncle. I was telling you about,
[02:17:35] like, every day. Now we do a work up. And then we just go get after for six months and come on to
[02:17:40] work up, go get after it. But he's like legitimately getting after it every day for 15 plus years.
[02:17:45] You know, like it's a 23 year deployment. Yeah, to a combat. Yeah. With limited resources, limited support,
[02:17:53] and then the training, limited training and in an, a hostile environment on both the criminal
[02:18:00] side and actually oftentimes on the civil side, you know, people that are, you know,
[02:18:05] lash out at police officers from that whole other angle now. So yeah, unfortunate.
[02:18:15] You done with your questions, Mr. Charles.
[02:18:16] Oh, for now. Okay. But I do have good news though. You do. My career oil came in. Oh,
[02:18:25] got that. That's good news. That is good news. We are happy about that. You take a
[02:18:30] real one. I take shark cartilage. Sure. Is that the same thing? No, that's like what,
[02:18:36] glucose. No, it's good for your dormitory. My, my dad got me on it, but I'll, I'll get on what you
[02:18:41] guys have. I'll give it a run. Yeah. If you do or when you do on it, it's the best one. Okay. Well,
[02:18:48] he's at the best one. It's the best one. Straight up the best one. Everyone knows that. Or just
[02:18:53] more than just people know. How do I get it? What I got? You got to on it.com. But if you're
[02:19:00] down to support the podcast, yeah, chain of yours, because you're here, yeah, go on it dot com slash
[02:19:05] jackel and support your wallet 10% off. Dude, savings and the best. Well, get some. So,
[02:19:13] one asked me, uh, this is, night yesterday, day before like, they're like, hey, I know, I know,
[02:19:18] you know, you guys are done with on it and all that stuff. But is that the only supplements
[02:19:22] you take for real? That's like, yeah, that is. Creole oil, alpha brain sometimes,
[02:19:29] shrimp tech. Warrior bars, too, but I don't know if that's a supplement. Anyway, those are
[02:19:35] so good. Yeah, definitely supplements. Your, your, your need food and take. Yeah, yeah,
[02:19:41] big time tasty. But yeah, you can support that way. If you're in the mood to also the Amazon,
[02:19:46] if you, this kind of, I'm, I'm just trying to analyze the whole Amazon thing. Like, how, how does
[02:19:50] that kind of fit in the whole, I mean, we kind of know how, but okay, so you click through when you
[02:19:54] do your shopping on Amazon, you click through for you to your shopping. Through the website,
[02:19:59] not a jackbuck, as.com or jocostor.com. So, I'm, you support that way, but so how does this fit in?
[02:20:06] Right. So it's kind of like, okay, we're here putting out this message, right? And people who
[02:20:12] like, click through, they buy shirts or something like that, they're kind of like the backup,
[02:20:16] kind of like the reinforcement, you know? They're actually the full on supporting mechanism,
[02:20:20] never mind the backup. Yeah, so they're all in the field. Right.
[02:20:24] Battle field. So, back up is that's a bad one. That's like, they're like the reinforcement,
[02:20:28] you know? They're the full on support mechanism. They're the reinforcement. Yes, the
[02:20:32] reinforcement. Yes, very good. Very good. And yeah, I'm, and so, so the Amazon click through,
[02:20:38] that's a good one. Good way to support this podcast support. And of course, subscribe, right?
[02:20:44] Yes. Yeah, I used it. Yeah, you did use it. So, I should, I'm getting asked this a lot, right?
[02:20:49] Yeah. And I'm not, I was going to lay out there. So podcast, you bought, where is that come from?
[02:20:53] Yeah. The really quick story. Here's where it comes from. Mm-hmm. There's a guy whose name is
[02:20:59] Hennach Lardach. Hennach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach.
[02:21:04] Just for clearing. Okay, for clearing. But those of us that speak with a fake Portuguese accent
[02:21:09] from time to time would just say, Hennach. Right. Right. Yeah, that's the right way. So anyways,
[02:21:15] there's a video production company called Flexpoint videos, which is, which is Echo Charles's company,
[02:21:23] and they did a series that starred this Brazilian Gittizu master, Hennach Lardach. And my son
[02:21:33] actually was very into the Hennach program. And they're, in, being into the program,
[02:21:41] he started to adapt his own fake Brazilian Portuguese accent. Yes. And since he speaks no Portuguese
[02:21:49] whatsoever, he just simply does the, the pigeon of it. And he adds words or, or parts to words
[02:22:00] that he thinks in his mind sound like they might be Portuguese. So one day he said to me in a
[02:22:06] broken, imitated fake Portuguese accent. He said, that, are you going to record that podcast Shiboha?
[02:22:16] Ah. And I said, yes, I am. And then that is where it came from. It doesn't mean anything.
[02:22:24] It doesn't have any spelling. It's just my 13 year old son with his comedic vibe going on.
[02:22:33] Yeah. So he, and so, but he, where he, how he got that from, or what he got that from is
[02:22:40] podcast, that's like the podcast. And then Paul Ha and Boa, this two things. Right. Right.
[02:22:47] Paul Ha is like this expression. It's like, it means something specific, but it's, it's ultimately
[02:22:52] it's an expression. But ultimately, let's be clear here. It's also a very bad word. Yes, yes.
[02:22:57] It's like the worst swear word. It's a very bad swear word in Portuguese. Yeah, that's
[02:23:04] Paul Ha. Yeah. It's like slang. It's, it's a mix. Yeah. So there's that then there's Boa, which means good.
[02:23:11] Oh, I mean it's good. Exactly. So, you know, your son's thing, I don't know if it was
[02:23:16] Paul Ha or Boa, I'm assuming, Paul Ha because Henato says, Paul Ha all the time. Yeah.
[02:23:21] So that's what he says. Boy, from time to time. Yeah. And my son, when he says it,
[02:23:25] it's podcast Shiboha. Yeah. So I'm not 100% sure. Yeah. But that's where it came from. Yeah.
[02:23:31] When we got a listen to that podcast Shiboha right here. Yeah. That's what we're going to do.
[02:23:36] That's crazy what our kids say. Yes. It's indeed. And still when you think of it, that's still
[02:23:41] kind of an ambiguous explanation. Really. So where does that leave us? You know, like, okay. So what is
[02:23:46] him? The thing is is, I don't know. Although, I guess it does mean that we're talking about this
[02:23:53] particular. Yeah. We're excited about it. Yes, we are. There it is. Oh. So
[02:24:00] back to the support thing. You know, subscribe if you haven't already. That's a good way to stay
[02:24:06] in the game. You know, when the new one comes out, just pull on your phone. Listen, ready. I know I am.
[02:24:13] Me too. And I'm on it. YouTube channel, video coming out. I think I'm going to do a more of a comedy
[02:24:20] video. See how that goes over. Well, won't go over well with me, obviously.
[02:24:24] Yeah. Hey, we've got the the heavy podcast that everybody loves it and let's get after it.
[02:24:32] And let's crush people and let's do the darkness and you're going to do a comedy video. Is that where we're going
[02:24:36] with this? Yeah. All right. Just the CL goes over. We'll trust that judgment. I guess.
[02:24:42] Let the troopers decide on that one. Yeah. Also, jocco store. That's where, you know, we
[02:24:48] sling these shirts. But it's less about selling shirts. It's more about, hey, if you want to support the podcast,
[02:24:54] you want to wear cool shirt with multiple layers. By the way, I talk about the layers, but let's just say,
[02:24:59] I don't want to go into a big thing about the layers. But there's more to it than just the saying,
[02:25:05] you know, discipline equals free. And what does that even mean? It sounds cool. What does that mean?
[02:25:09] Anyway, there's a meaning darkness doesn't meaning and all the shirts have. Of course, the
[02:25:13] meaning behind the t-shirt that says, the one that you're wearing with it just says jocco podcast. That's just
[02:25:19] the name. Well, if you look on the back, you can see the meaning. Oh, there you go. What are you going to find
[02:25:24] about? That's the layers I'm talking about. You know, women stuff coming out, take tops are already
[02:25:30] out, but the women's t-shirts are coming out as well. Just going to give all the girls or the women
[02:25:35] and a small update. Some girls with some women are at the mustard. They certainly are. Asking
[02:25:40] about some stuff, I told enforce. That's some new patches. The two, the three by two, so they can
[02:25:48] fit on the standard Velcro situation. And I think, and there's like a tan color, right? It's like the
[02:25:56] official color that's good for the troopers that are going out. The desert. I'm right. That's FDE,
[02:26:02] federal dark earth. Yeah. Good, because I was trying to Google that and find out and there's a bunch of
[02:26:10] them. Yeah, FDE. I got the new sig 320 in. So sick. And of course, I had to get one for Amanda.
[02:26:18] So each have sig 320 compact FDE. Yeah. Actually, that's coincidentally really helpful. I was
[02:26:26] looking for a long time for that. Awesome. Yeah. Rascar's a good two. Look at them. Multiple layers
[02:26:33] like I said. Just trust me on that. And that, those, by the way, it's just support if you're in the
[02:26:39] market. You can also support the podcast by buying some darker YT. Yes. If you want to
[02:26:46] just improve every single aspect of your life. No, if you want to get some tea, you can get it. If you
[02:26:56] don't think you like tea, you probably will like this tea because even though it's technically
[02:27:00] tea, it doesn't actually even taste like tea. It tastes like a nectar that you need to try.
[02:27:08] I can't explain it. I agree with that. I did a lot of last couple of days. Yeah. And the
[02:27:13] mustard and man, I was awesome. It's tasty. And plus as we know from the Amazon
[02:27:20] reviews, it is added. There's a guy who deadlift went from 400 pounds to 8,000 pounds. That's a
[02:27:31] 7,600 pound increase. In your deadlift. And so that's right there. Again, that's good to go.
[02:27:40] So get yourself some Amazon tea. Also when you're on Amazon, you can pick up, you can get yourself
[02:27:48] a copy of a book called Extreme Ownership that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin. And the thing is,
[02:27:53] if you have a copy, that's cool. Get a couple more. You want to have them on standby because sometimes
[02:27:59] you're just dealing with someone at work and all of a sudden you realize that they're not taking
[02:28:03] ownership of something. It's no problem. You're not stressed out. You're just reaching your
[02:28:07] desk and you grab a copy. You go, hey, one to take a quick look at this right here. Up the chain
[02:28:12] command down the chain of command. Now when you do that, now will be you're going to make their life better
[02:28:18] because they're going to be able to figure some stuff out. You're also going to make your life easier
[02:28:21] because now you're surrounding personnel are in the game. And you're taking extreme ownership
[02:28:30] in and of it. So that's actually because we're making it. Not like a lot of people. That's the question.
[02:28:34] That is deep. No, because that's the question people have there be like, hey, what do I do when
[02:28:37] my colleague is not taking extreme ownership? You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah. See,
[02:28:41] the just the near nature of you saying, hey, you're not taking extreme ownership. That's you're not
[02:28:46] taking extreme ownership. So now you're only at your saying, hey, I recognize this situation of you
[02:28:52] doing and not doing certain things. Let me take action. What can I do to take extreme ownership
[02:28:57] over this situation? But it's true. That is true. That is true. Also, you know, as you are on Amazon,
[02:29:04] just just nod your head a little bit and say thanks to Brady Lanter, Brady Trooper, who has been
[02:29:13] the backside support to the podcast. She bohaha with all kinds of stuff. So shout out to Brady for
[02:29:21] getting after it. Technically, he's getting after it technically. Technically.
[02:29:26] I think they end up going to do it. Now you just talked about the mustard too. We just had to
[02:29:30] mustard and San Diego, California. It was freaking awesome. Yes. It was really cool. We had a bunch of
[02:29:37] people there. The guy that helped run the event and they met, he's going to run an event for
[02:29:44] 20 something years. And he came up to me two hours into the event. You know, this is after people
[02:29:50] were peating at 445 in the morning. This is after everyone was in their seats at 0800,
[02:29:54] ready standing by to get after it. No stragglers. Like, like, when I say no stragglers, I mean,
[02:29:58] no stragglers. 0 350 people boom in their seats, ready to rock and roll. He came out to me.
[02:30:05] During the first little break and he says, I've actually never seen anything like this. We're
[02:30:10] an entire conference is so just on board in the game and getting after it. He said, never seen this
[02:30:16] in any kind of conference. And so major prep. And yeah, come down. The schedule says, hey,
[02:30:27] echo, film some stuff. Right. That's the thing. Kind of the loose order. Commanders in.
[02:30:32] And look at this schedule. Hey, four of optional. Optional 445 workout and okay, I'm
[02:30:38] beyond it. So I'm not used to the 445. It's cool. Don't get it wrong. But I'm not just not used
[02:30:43] to 445 filming work workouts, whatever. Being awake. So I'm like, you know what I'm going to do?
[02:30:49] I'm going to go. I'm going to show up on time. I'm going to show up ahead of time. But really,
[02:30:52] though, optional, really first day. Let's face it. How many people are really going to be at this
[02:30:58] thing? Maybe 25 or 30. I'm thinking. And pan traveling to 20. Yeah, I mean, yeah, we had guys from
[02:31:04] UK, you know, five different countries were represented 42 different states like it was insane.
[02:31:10] So they were all over. Yeah. There's no way. I was like, I was even, I'm not a morning person.
[02:31:16] Like you. Like I'm usually got that's up and told two or three working on stuff. Yeah. So I was like,
[02:31:21] I'm going to get up. I was like, yeah, I'm here with Jock on life. I mean, that's all. I've got to
[02:31:24] get after it. I was like, I'm going to be pissed. There's like five people out there. Yeah, I'm thinking
[02:31:29] 10. I'm 20. It would be solid. But I pulled right. And I'm ahead of time. By the way, I'm pulling
[02:31:35] up like 428, you know, 429. I come around on the corner and I see a straight up riot. Like,
[02:31:42] not rioting. But like the type of crowd that's like, you know, in a protest or something. Which
[02:31:48] guy stretching, you know, I'm like, dang. So I go at a park lake on the side. I come and you guys
[02:31:53] already had worked out. Yeah. Yeah. So what people would lay for. I read. Yeah. What lay for
[02:31:57] I do is we went. I said, hey, life, we might get contingency is there's a 150 people. We're not
[02:32:04] going to be able to direct this thing if we're doing it. We need to get leadership position. So we
[02:32:09] need to go work out before the 04445 must work out. We need to go work out before that. Optional
[02:32:15] then. So we went and hit it before. And it's a pretty hard core workout. One of those workouts
[02:32:21] where it can suck as much as you want the suck. And of course, we wanted to suck that. So we were
[02:32:27] dripping with sweat. We come walking over. And it's the same thing for us. We are walking back
[02:32:31] from the workout area, which was down by the San Diego Convention Center. We're walking back to the
[02:32:36] hotel. We're in a little jog. We turn the corner. Now we're really close. We start walking. And we see
[02:32:42] the same thing. We see like all these people. And it was, you know, 250 or 300 people are
[02:32:48] ready to rock and roll at four. It's only 428. It's not even us. It's nighttime. It's not even
[02:32:54] nighttime. It's not nighttime. It's straight up nighttime. So we got after it. And that was a good
[02:33:00] representation of the attitude that was at the master. And the other funny thing was people kept
[02:33:07] it. When people asked questions, they'd say, oh, I just got promoted in this new position.
[02:33:11] And this is going on. And then someone else said, you know, I just got promoted three times
[02:33:16] in the last six months. And I want to know. And so you're thinking, okay, all these people are
[02:33:20] just fast-tracked. They're in the game. They're on it. It's just, it was, it was really an awesome event.
[02:33:26] Great job with the video, Eko Charles made some really killer videos for that. And it was awesome.
[02:33:33] Those videos were awesome. Like very captivating. You know, me sitting there in the crowd.
[02:33:38] Yeah. It was just like, other than the couple of times, I had to get up and the first
[02:33:42] test stood in the back, first sat in the back, and I had to get up and I'd pace. Because I was
[02:33:47] just like so connected. It was just brought me back, you know, or just emotional connection. And
[02:33:51] you know, everyone else in the same thing. And the second day I'm sitting up in front row. I was like,
[02:33:54] I can't stand up in pace right now. But just everyone, you just watch other people and just
[02:33:59] do great job. Those videos were insane man. You were in one of them. I know. I had the
[02:34:05] doctor's mask on, so nobody recommended it. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody asked me about it. They're like,
[02:34:12] pretty blonde in the gown and twins, babies and my get-up. Yeah, that's right. That's the rough transition
[02:34:19] video. Yeah. So the rough transition, Tristan video that Eko made is the person holding the baby.
[02:34:26] The baby. The babies. Yeah. That's JP, right, Jerry. So there's a little layer right there.
[02:34:33] Is there a little enough? I'm not sure what you're talking about. Yeah. If you're kind of on the
[02:34:37] inside, you're going to see them. You're going to recognize them. That's kind of the fun part. One of
[02:34:40] the many fun parts. Awesome. And also, so if you like what we're talking about here, and you want to
[02:34:48] continue, maybe you didn't get enough of this today. You want to keep talking to us. You can actually
[02:34:53] just find us cruising, cruising hard, apparently, on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram.

[02:36:05] you know, I got the call from Jocco. You know, I turned out a couple different gigs or, you know,
[02:36:11] switched some work around. I was like, yeah, I got out here. Yeah, on a man I was like, yeah,
[02:36:16] yeah, don't be in it. You're going. Yeah, we'll find a way. And it was awesome. You know, we work out and
[02:36:22] be on the podcast, you know, I just appreciate you guys having me out here, man. Of course. Awesome.
[02:36:27] You got to fight off all. Yeah. Obviously, I just want to thank all the troops overseas, all the
[02:36:33] troops that are home. The family members of the troops that never made it back. We appreciate you guys.
[02:36:40] All the law enforcement officers out there, firefighters, medics, you guys are getting after it.
[02:36:44] Serving your community every day. And of course, I want to thank Amanda just for her continued
[02:36:50] support and love and my kids, you know, love those kids. Look forward to the day where they're
[02:36:56] old enough where they can actually listen and process this. So, Aiden Coranola, I love you guys.
[02:37:01] And yeah, it's awesome. Well, thanks for coming on. Appreciate it. Obviously, thank you. And
[02:37:10] thanks for everything you've ever done for me, brother. I appreciate above and beyond anything I could
[02:37:16] have ever hoped for the kind of performance and the kind of the kind of attitude and the
[02:37:23] bravery and the courage always. Thank you. Thank you. Always. Thank you.
[02:37:34] And you know, the other day when we were at the master, we were in that big ground. And we had kind
[02:37:41] of, we kind of turned the corner and we were getting to the area where we were going to start the
[02:37:45] work out thing. And I knew I was so obsessed real quick. I said, I'm going to need some help
[02:37:51] getting some organization stuff going on here. And we really didn't have a plan for 300 people, right?
[02:37:56] We had a plan for 30 or 40 people. Wait, different. And so I'm sitting there and I'm going into,
[02:38:02] okay, what am I going to do? Got a prioritize next. I need some help. And it's just dark, you know,
[02:38:06] dark four o'clock in the morning. So, I just yell out, I go, J.P. And instantly, I hear some distance
[02:38:14] away I hear. Yes, sir. And I look up where that came from and I see J.P. And he like made
[02:38:19] quick eye contact when you're seeing moving, you know, down the stairs, he's coming to me. And in that
[02:38:25] split second, that split second, I remembered all the times that I had called your name. And I had
[02:38:35] asked you to do what needed to be done. You always stepped up without question, without, without regard
[02:38:45] for your safety or for your own security. You always stepped up just with your, the mission,
[02:38:53] and the team and your brothers in mind. Always putting others before yourself, but so many others
[02:39:04] in our task unit did. Mark and Mikey and Ryan and like the many soldiers and marines did
[02:39:20] in the battle of Ramadi and in the rest of Iraq and in Afghanistan and on battlefields all over
[02:39:28] the world throughout history, putting others before themselves with their heads held high.
[02:39:42] And everyone else that is out there listening, think about that. Think about putting the mission
[02:40:01] before your own needs. Think about putting others before yourself and think about walking through the
[02:40:18] world with all the threats and challenges in front of you. Think about walking through the daily
[02:40:28] battles that you face with your back straight and your head held high facing the threat,
[02:40:44] facing the fear, scanning for what is next so you can engage and get after it.
[02:40:54] So until next time, this is echo and jocco and my brother J. P. Denell out.
