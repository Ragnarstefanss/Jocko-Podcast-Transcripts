00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.46
This is Jockel Podcast number 91.

2
00:00:04.46 --> 00:00:07.68
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:07.68 --> 00:00:08.68
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.68 --> 00:00:10.08
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.08 --> 00:00:14.72
And we are rolling straight into Q&A today.

6
00:00:14.72 --> 00:00:18.36
So questions from the interwebs.

7
00:00:18.36 --> 00:00:21.000
Echo Charles, go.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.52
Go.

9
00:00:21.52 --> 00:00:22.76
Okay, first question.

10
00:00:26.04 --> 00:00:29.08
Jockel, I've just finished about face the book.

11
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:30.52
Amazing book.

12
00:00:30.52 --> 00:00:35.52
Interested how you modeled your style on Hackworth though.

13
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:40.000
Hack was a renegade and always bending the rules to break to the breaking point.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.04
But in extreme ownership, you talk about, for example, not pushing back on higher command

15
00:00:45.04 --> 00:00:47.40
when it came to Iraqi troops.

16
00:00:47.40 --> 00:00:53.32
Have listened to podcasts too, but was hoping you could go into it a bit more.

17
00:00:53.32 --> 00:00:54.32
Yeah.

18
00:00:54.32 --> 00:00:57.04
I guess that's a good question.

19
00:00:57.04 --> 00:01:03.04
Hack, he was kind of considered renegade, but also he's also a total company man.

20
00:01:03.04 --> 00:01:04.96
You got to realize that there's that dichotomy.

21
00:01:04.96 --> 00:01:08.48
There's a guy that Hack loved the army.

22
00:01:08.48 --> 00:01:10.000
He loved the army.

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.48
He wanted his uniform.

24
00:01:11.48 --> 00:01:13.04
Wood looks super square away.

25
00:01:13.04 --> 00:01:15.96
He followed all the rules and regulations.

26
00:01:15.96 --> 00:01:21.84
And he supported the leadership all the time when the leadership was right.

27
00:01:21.84 --> 00:01:25.16
And that's what makes him a good renegade in my opinion.

28
00:01:25.16 --> 00:01:27.36
And I was very much the same way.

29
00:01:27.36 --> 00:01:30.12
I was all about the Navy.

30
00:01:30.12 --> 00:01:32.88
I was all about the games.

31
00:01:32.88 --> 00:01:35.12
Has a matter of fact Tony, you know what Tony used to say?

32
00:01:35.12 --> 00:01:39.12
It was a little thing we got going in to you, bruiser, that spread around.

33
00:01:39.12 --> 00:01:43.08
But of course it came from Tony first, which was all Navy all the time.

34
00:01:43.08 --> 00:01:48.76
We'd just be joking about, you know, I think I don't know what originally caused

35
00:01:48.76 --> 00:01:53.84
it, but like guys would make fun of me because I would wear like jungle boots or Dan

36
00:01:53.84 --> 00:01:57.68
or boots out to on Liberty with a curve like old jeans.

37
00:01:57.68 --> 00:02:03.04
Yeah, because when you're like that kind of old just raised in the teams, you don't even

38
00:02:03.04 --> 00:02:04.04
know when you're different.

39
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:06.32
And you're like, oh, I'm going out and I need to wear shoes.

40
00:02:06.32 --> 00:02:07.32
Cool.

41
00:02:07.32 --> 00:02:08.32
Where's my jungle boots?

42
00:02:08.32 --> 00:02:09.76
That's what you end up like.

43
00:02:09.76 --> 00:02:10.76
And you're into it.

44
00:02:10.76 --> 00:02:12.12
You're not like, you think it's good.

45
00:02:12.12 --> 00:02:13.12
You think it's normal.

46
00:02:13.12 --> 00:02:15.52
This is the way things are.

47
00:02:15.52 --> 00:02:18.72
And so I supported the teams.

48
00:02:18.72 --> 00:02:21.000
And hacks supported the army, of course.

49
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.20
But this is the thing, if the leadership was wrong or there was something being passed

50
00:02:24.20 --> 00:02:27.12
down, that was wrong.

51
00:02:27.12 --> 00:02:28.28
And it was a big wrong.

52
00:02:28.28 --> 00:02:32.08
Like if it was a little, I wouldn't be like, oh man, this is crap.

53
00:02:32.08 --> 00:02:36.96
They're making us wear different pairs of shorts now because that would happen.

54
00:02:36.96 --> 00:02:41.92
Like some new commanding officer would come in and change some thing, right?

55
00:02:41.92 --> 00:02:43.92
And sometimes people, oh man, why would we kind of do that with?

56
00:02:43.92 --> 00:02:45.40
It's like, dude, be quiet.

57
00:02:45.40 --> 00:02:46.40
You know, just be quiet.

58
00:02:46.40 --> 00:02:48.68
You know, they're giving you new shorts, where are the new shorts?

59
00:02:48.68 --> 00:02:51.48
You know, oh, they're telling us we can't wear baseball hats anymore.

60
00:02:51.48 --> 00:02:52.48
Cool, don't wear baseball hats.

61
00:02:52.48 --> 00:02:54.52
And some guys would go, man, they're true.

62
00:02:54.52 --> 00:02:55.88
And then it's who cares?

63
00:02:55.88 --> 00:02:58.72
It's like, okay, what I'm wearing on my head, you know?

64
00:02:58.72 --> 00:03:02.36
Like, oh, you want to issue his different ball caps or find whatever.

65
00:03:02.36 --> 00:03:07.36
But then if it was a larger issue, then, or obviously, if it was something that was

66
00:03:07.36 --> 00:03:12.24
like actually wrong, like criminally wrong or morally wrong or something like that, then yeah,

67
00:03:12.24 --> 00:03:15.20
I'd be like, no, we can't do that.

68
00:03:15.20 --> 00:03:22.28
So the reason that I didn't push back on Iraqi troops and working with Iraqi troops when

69
00:03:22.28 --> 00:03:28.16
we got to Ramadi was because as I looked at it, I realized that it was the right thing

70
00:03:28.16 --> 00:03:30.08
to do.

71
00:03:30.08 --> 00:03:32.64
And yes, it was going to be more dangerous.

72
00:03:32.64 --> 00:03:37.84
And yes, it definitely took us out of our comfort zone, but as I explained in extreme

73
00:03:37.84 --> 00:03:43.24
ownership, if we didn't train those people up, if we didn't train the Iraqi soldiers

74
00:03:43.24 --> 00:03:47.56
and take them out and get them fighting and get them squared away on the battlefield,

75
00:03:47.56 --> 00:03:51.52
then Americans would have been doing it forever.

76
00:03:51.52 --> 00:03:54.72
So it was the correct call was to do that.

77
00:03:54.72 --> 00:04:02.16
Now, I've talked about the same thing when they told us, or ratio.

78
00:04:02.16 --> 00:04:05.24
They gave us a ratio of how many Iraqis we had to have for every one Iraqi.

79
00:04:05.24 --> 00:04:07.24
We had to have, I don't know what they're like for real with them.

80
00:04:07.24 --> 00:04:13.12
Or seven, or for every one seal, we had to have seven Iraqi soldiers.

81
00:04:13.12 --> 00:04:14.84
They said that, something like that.

82
00:04:14.84 --> 00:04:16.84
I figured with the numbers.

83
00:04:16.84 --> 00:04:21.48
And I said, that doesn't make sense to us because sometimes we only have 10 guys to go

84
00:04:21.48 --> 00:04:22.48
out.

85
00:04:22.48 --> 00:04:27.44
And there's no way I'm sending only one seal with 10 Iraqi soldiers, not doing it.

86
00:04:27.44 --> 00:04:32.24
Need a corpsman, need a radioman, need a machine gunner, need a leader.

87
00:04:32.24 --> 00:04:33.96
That's what I need.

88
00:04:33.96 --> 00:04:38.24
So, and when I pushed back, because I didn't push back against ball caps and because

89
00:04:38.24 --> 00:04:44.20
I didn't push back against some stupid uniform change, they were like, oh yeah, well,

90
00:04:44.20 --> 00:04:45.24
that actually makes sense, Chaka.

91
00:04:45.24 --> 00:04:47.96
We don't want you to go in the field with only one seal.

92
00:04:47.96 --> 00:04:52.64
So I would clearly push back if it was something that didn't make sense.

93
00:04:52.64 --> 00:04:57.24
Same thing with like the martial arts training that they had us doing in the late 90s and

94
00:04:57.24 --> 00:04:58.76
early 2000s.

95
00:04:58.76 --> 00:05:00.36
It was not good.

96
00:05:00.36 --> 00:05:02.96
And I was told everyone, hey, this is not smart.

97
00:05:02.96 --> 00:05:03.92
This is not good.

98
00:05:03.92 --> 00:05:05.08
This training is dumb.

99
00:05:05.08 --> 00:05:08.92
We need to do other training that's better.

100
00:05:08.92 --> 00:05:15.16
And same thing, you know, things go, oh, like here's another stupid example.

101
00:05:15.16 --> 00:05:17.32
They wouldn't want to issue a platoon.

102
00:05:17.32 --> 00:05:21.04
The radio is you're going to take on deployment because they didn't want you to break

103
00:05:21.04 --> 00:05:22.84
them or whatever.

104
00:05:22.84 --> 00:05:26.08
And say they'd issue not enough radio is for everyone.

105
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:28.16
It's a now that everyone doesn't know how to operate the radio is.

106
00:05:28.16 --> 00:05:31.12
And you're basically operationally testing the radio is while you're going through

107
00:05:31.12 --> 00:05:32.12
your work up.

108
00:05:32.12 --> 00:05:33.80
So I said, hey, this is garbage.

109
00:05:33.80 --> 00:05:34.80
You everyone radios.

110
00:05:34.80 --> 00:05:37.32
If that's how we operate, that's how we need to train.

111
00:05:37.32 --> 00:05:40.12
So in the training, they wouldn't issue the radio.

112
00:05:40.12 --> 00:05:42.36
Yeah, there was like a time period where we were low on radio.

113
00:05:42.36 --> 00:05:44.40
And they said, we're going to keep these radios for deployment.

114
00:05:44.40 --> 00:05:45.40
And that doesn't make sense.

115
00:05:45.40 --> 00:05:46.40
I got a good idea.

116
00:05:46.40 --> 00:05:48.40
Buy more radios.

117
00:05:48.40 --> 00:05:51.000
So, you know, those were things I'd push back on.

118
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.28
And you were always pushing back on the type of training that was going to happen and

119
00:05:54.28 --> 00:05:56.68
who is going to, how you're going to run the training.

120
00:05:56.68 --> 00:06:05.76
So when something, when it made sense to push back, I pushed back, just like Hackworth

121
00:06:05.76 --> 00:06:06.76
did.

122
00:06:06.76 --> 00:06:09.36
Now Hackworth did it on a massive scale because he eventually pushed back on the way

123
00:06:09.36 --> 00:06:12.20
the ward, Vietnam was being run.

124
00:06:12.20 --> 00:06:15.52
And had I been smart enough.

125
00:06:15.52 --> 00:06:17.52
And the ward didn't take the shift that it took.

126
00:06:17.52 --> 00:06:19.88
And we didn't move towards counter insurgency.

127
00:06:19.88 --> 00:06:25.32
And we didn't make those adjustments that that Karmic Farland implemented in Ramadi.

128
00:06:25.32 --> 00:06:27.68
Maybe I doubt it.

129
00:06:27.68 --> 00:06:29.88
Maybe I would have been smart if say, hey, we're not running this ward right.

130
00:06:29.88 --> 00:06:32.28
We need to do something different and run up the chain of clan.

131
00:06:32.28 --> 00:06:36.36
But at the time, Karmic Farland made great decisions.

132
00:06:36.36 --> 00:06:38.92
He had a great plan, a great strategy.

133
00:06:38.92 --> 00:06:41.48
So I was 100% on board.

134
00:06:41.48 --> 00:06:46.68
But if Hackworth that didn't happen, they were not fighting correctly against the Vietnamese.

135
00:06:46.68 --> 00:06:52.64
And they were taking massive casualties for a hill that two days later, they've given

136
00:06:52.64 --> 00:06:53.64
back.

137
00:06:53.64 --> 00:06:55.60
And so he was saying, what are you doing?

138
00:06:55.60 --> 00:07:00.48
And the other thing, when he took over the hardcore battalion, they were fighting for

139
00:07:00.48 --> 00:07:01.48
months.

140
00:07:01.48 --> 00:07:06.12
And they had literally killed almost no, anyway, I think it was zero.

141
00:07:06.12 --> 00:07:07.88
I think it was actually zero enemy.

142
00:07:07.88 --> 00:07:10.80
And yet they had taken all kinds of casualties themselves.

143
00:07:10.80 --> 00:07:13.04
And so he's saying, wait, this is wrong.

144
00:07:13.04 --> 00:07:14.04
This is wrong.

145
00:07:14.04 --> 00:07:18.20
So I think that's what being a leader is.

146
00:07:18.20 --> 00:07:19.20
You support the stuff.

147
00:07:19.20 --> 00:07:20.20
You support the command.

148
00:07:20.20 --> 00:07:22.64
Yes, of course you support the command.

149
00:07:22.64 --> 00:07:23.64
And it makes sense.

150
00:07:23.64 --> 00:07:24.76
And as long as it makes sense.

151
00:07:24.76 --> 00:07:26.32
And normally it's going to make sense.

152
00:07:26.32 --> 00:07:27.32
You know what I mean?

153
00:07:27.32 --> 00:07:28.32
Normally it's going to make sense.

154
00:07:28.32 --> 00:07:31.20
Not like the admels and the generals are saying, hey, how can we lose this war?

155
00:07:31.20 --> 00:07:32.60
Let's come up with a stupid strategy.

156
00:07:32.60 --> 00:07:34.24
No, they're doing the best they can.

157
00:07:34.24 --> 00:07:36.12
So it's not like it's a regular occurrence.

158
00:07:36.12 --> 00:07:39.32
I mean, like I said, when I was working for Karmic Farland.

159
00:07:39.32 --> 00:07:40.48
He was a smart guy.

160
00:07:40.48 --> 00:07:42.56
He was a brilliant guy that had a great strategy.

161
00:07:42.56 --> 00:07:44.32
Oh, I'm like, okay, awesome.

162
00:07:44.32 --> 00:07:46.96
I'm here to support.

163
00:07:46.96 --> 00:07:51.32
And I'll tell you, when I did, and this is, I think this is important, is that even though

164
00:07:51.32 --> 00:07:54.88
I was kind of a renegade and I was more rebellious when I was a kid.

165
00:07:54.88 --> 00:07:58.20
Obviously, I was a, I was young when I got the seal teams.

166
00:07:58.20 --> 00:08:00.24
Then so you know, we would push all those things.

167
00:08:00.24 --> 00:08:01.80
But I said, oh, we got to do this.

168
00:08:01.80 --> 00:08:04.68
That was me when I was a E4 in the seal teams.

169
00:08:04.68 --> 00:08:06.48
You know, what do we got to do that?

170
00:08:06.48 --> 00:08:08.60
We should just be able to do whatever we want.

171
00:08:08.60 --> 00:08:10.44
You know, we were just stupid.

172
00:08:10.44 --> 00:08:17.28
But as I got older, I realized that you need to, you know, come across as a renegade

173
00:08:17.28 --> 00:08:21.20
quote unquote to come across as a big rebel that doesn't, well, immediately when you

174
00:08:21.20 --> 00:08:23.36
go and push back on something, everyone just dismisses you.

175
00:08:23.36 --> 00:08:24.88
Oh, yeah, Jocco, he's just a lot mouth.

176
00:08:24.88 --> 00:08:26.76
He just, he just pushed back against everything.

177
00:08:26.76 --> 00:08:28.24
He doesn't what he's want to do everything his way.

178
00:08:28.24 --> 00:08:30.92
No, you want them to say, oh, wow, hold on a second.

179
00:08:30.92 --> 00:08:35.96
If Jocco is pushing back against this, then this, this must be something wrong here.

180
00:08:35.96 --> 00:08:37.28
Because he doesn't push back against stuff.

181
00:08:37.28 --> 00:08:38.52
He tells the line all the time.

182
00:08:38.52 --> 00:08:40.000
So we should listen to him.

183
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.60
That's what you want to build.

184
00:08:41.60 --> 00:08:43.96
That's what I did my best to build.

185
00:08:43.96 --> 00:08:50.36
And that's how I think it would be comparable to the way Hack worth led and the way that I

186
00:08:50.36 --> 00:08:51.36
tried to.

187
00:08:51.36 --> 00:08:55.88
Obviously, I know Hack worth, but I stole as much as I could from him.

188
00:08:55.88 --> 00:08:57.40
And the weird thing is I'll tell you this.

189
00:08:57.40 --> 00:09:02.40
I always say I stole from him, but it wasn't like I was sitting there reading the

190
00:09:02.40 --> 00:09:04.36
book and going, I'm going to do what he did here.

191
00:09:04.36 --> 00:09:06.12
I think it was just absorbed.

192
00:09:06.12 --> 00:09:13.36
And even the naming of Task Unit Bruser, like when I did it, I wasn't thinking this

193
00:09:13.36 --> 00:09:15.08
is what Hack worth did.

194
00:09:15.08 --> 00:09:17.08
But it was real obvious that that's where I got it from.

195
00:09:17.08 --> 00:09:20.32
I didn't think, I'm going to rename this and we're going to turn this thing around.

196
00:09:20.32 --> 00:09:24.28
And based on, or we're not turning around, but we're going to build this based on, no,

197
00:09:24.28 --> 00:09:28.08
I was like, you know, we're not going to be task unit Bravo because that sounds lame.

198
00:09:28.08 --> 00:09:31.56
We're going to be task unit Bruser because that sounds awesome.

199
00:09:31.56 --> 00:09:36.64
And then later, you know, that's exactly what Hack worth did.

200
00:09:36.64 --> 00:09:38.80
Obviously stole it from him.

201
00:09:38.80 --> 00:09:40.36
So appreciate it, Hack.

202
00:09:40.36 --> 00:09:41.64
But that's what I'd say.

203
00:09:41.64 --> 00:09:46.40
Be a renegade, but that should be in the background.

204
00:09:46.40 --> 00:09:47.40
That should be in the background.

205
00:09:47.40 --> 00:09:48.40
That should be in the background.

206
00:09:48.40 --> 00:09:50.28
In the front of your mind should be, hey, I'm a supporter.

207
00:09:50.28 --> 00:09:51.28
Of what's happening.

208
00:09:51.28 --> 00:09:52.28
Hmm.

209
00:09:52.28 --> 00:09:56.88
Kind of like the willingness to be a renegade.

210
00:09:56.88 --> 00:09:57.88
If you have to.

211
00:09:57.88 --> 00:09:58.88
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:09:58.88 --> 00:09:59.88
If you have to.

213
00:09:59.88 --> 00:10:03.16
And believe me, I've known all kinds of good seals that were too renegade.

214
00:10:03.16 --> 00:10:05.08
Yeah, that's just like I'm a renegade.

215
00:10:05.08 --> 00:10:07.08
Yeah, they're just straight up, hey, I'm a renegade.

216
00:10:07.08 --> 00:10:12.24
And you know, that just the only guys that could get away with that were guys that were

217
00:10:12.24 --> 00:10:16.76
so, ultimately, operationally squared away.

218
00:10:16.76 --> 00:10:20.24
That people go, yeah, you know, he's kind of a maniac, but he's really really good.

219
00:10:20.24 --> 00:10:21.24
Really tacked.

220
00:10:21.24 --> 00:10:23.20
We sound like all that and they could, they make that happen.

221
00:10:23.20 --> 00:10:28.20
Now, as you get more and more senior, homey don't play like that.

222
00:10:28.20 --> 00:10:32.000
Yeah, if there's certain point, it's done and you've got to get, you've got to play the

223
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
game.

224
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
That's what you've got to do.

225
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.24
As you get more senior, you've got to play the game.

226
00:10:35.24 --> 00:10:39.88
And from like your subordinates viewpoint, if they looked at me and go, oh,

227
00:10:39.88 --> 00:10:41.44
Joc was just playing the game.

228
00:10:41.44 --> 00:10:43.76
He's just doing, you guess I am.

229
00:10:43.76 --> 00:10:44.92
Yes, I am.

230
00:10:44.92 --> 00:10:49.48
Because this way gives me more ability to control everything that's going to impact

231
00:10:49.48 --> 00:10:51.72
you people that work for me.

232
00:10:51.72 --> 00:10:54.84
So yes, I'm going to play the game so you don't have to.

233
00:10:54.84 --> 00:10:58.56
You're welcome.

234
00:10:58.56 --> 00:11:00.28
So yeah, check.

235
00:11:00.28 --> 00:11:01.28
Yeah, man.

236
00:11:01.28 --> 00:11:04.16
Makes sense.

237
00:11:04.16 --> 00:11:08.32
Next question.

238
00:11:08.32 --> 00:11:13.64
BJJ, due to during your time in Iraq.

239
00:11:13.64 --> 00:11:16.32
If you like, please paint me a picture.

240
00:11:16.32 --> 00:11:20.96
How to imagine a BJJ class from you as an active soldier.

241
00:11:20.96 --> 00:11:21.96
Did you have a key?

242
00:11:21.96 --> 00:11:22.96
Maths.

243
00:11:22.96 --> 00:11:27.36
And how would it differ from a quote unquote normal class?

244
00:11:27.36 --> 00:11:32.84
So yeah, I always brought maths with me starting with 1998.

245
00:11:32.84 --> 00:11:34.64
I think it's when I started bringing maths with me.

246
00:11:34.64 --> 00:11:35.64
How do you bring maths?

247
00:11:35.64 --> 00:11:39.64
Do you just be like, hey, in military transport, you build something called a pallet.

248
00:11:39.64 --> 00:11:44.28
So you get a big pallet and they're like eight feet by eight feet.

249
00:11:44.28 --> 00:11:45.76
Yeah, pretty big.

250
00:11:45.76 --> 00:11:48.52
You put stack all kinds of stuff on them.

251
00:11:48.52 --> 00:11:50.40
And you know, you got your weapons.

252
00:11:50.40 --> 00:11:51.56
Just got whatever you like.

253
00:11:51.56 --> 00:11:52.80
You got your engines.

254
00:11:52.80 --> 00:11:53.80
You got your motors.

255
00:11:53.80 --> 00:11:55.28
You got your motors.

256
00:11:55.28 --> 00:11:58.08
You got your boats, your zodiac boats.

257
00:11:58.08 --> 00:11:59.08
You got paddles.

258
00:11:59.08 --> 00:12:00.08
You got all this.

259
00:12:00.08 --> 00:12:01.52
I mean, all the equipment.

260
00:12:01.52 --> 00:12:02.88
Everyone's personal gears on there.

261
00:12:02.88 --> 00:12:03.88
They're up gear.

262
00:12:03.88 --> 00:12:04.88
They're body armor.

263
00:12:04.88 --> 00:12:05.88
It's all in these big pallets.

264
00:12:05.88 --> 00:12:10.48
And when you go into a planet, you'll have eight pallets, eight of these giant pallets.

265
00:12:10.48 --> 00:12:13.000
And so on some of those pallets, there would be maths.

266
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.44
So who is it up to though?

267
00:12:14.44 --> 00:12:18.12
You're talking about weapons and zodiacs and stuff.

268
00:12:18.12 --> 00:12:20.88
And then that's like who's it up to?

269
00:12:20.88 --> 00:12:22.88
Well, whoever's in charge.

270
00:12:22.88 --> 00:12:23.88
Which we're talking about.

271
00:12:23.88 --> 00:12:27.24
So that it made it real easy.

272
00:12:27.24 --> 00:12:31.000
And even if it wasn't me, I mean, everybody, you know, if people are bringing something

273
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.52
to help everyone get better, you know, people are, yeah, that's cool.

274
00:12:34.52 --> 00:12:36.52
So is it like an approval process?

275
00:12:36.52 --> 00:12:37.52
No, man.

276
00:12:37.52 --> 00:12:40.56
You get to like this is what other guys bring in all kinds of crazy things.

277
00:12:40.56 --> 00:12:43.80
I remember guys, you know, you guys bring surfboards.

278
00:12:43.80 --> 00:12:45.64
I mean, they pack their surfboards on pallets.

279
00:12:45.64 --> 00:12:48.28
They pack weights and squat racks.

280
00:12:48.28 --> 00:12:52.12
And anything that you want, you know, if you're going on a six month deployment to remote

281
00:12:52.12 --> 00:12:55.36
location, yeah, you're going to, you're going to load out of squat rack at a bunch of

282
00:12:55.36 --> 00:12:56.36
bump replits.

283
00:12:56.36 --> 00:13:00.64
And if that remote location has waves, you're packing surfboards.

284
00:13:00.64 --> 00:13:05.28
If it has, if it has, you know, rock climbing, you're going to pack rock climbing gear.

285
00:13:05.28 --> 00:13:06.28
Yeah.

286
00:13:06.28 --> 00:13:09.96
That's, I'm telling you, this is one of the things that it's really hard to, the seal

287
00:13:09.96 --> 00:13:10.96
teams.

288
00:13:10.96 --> 00:13:12.52
It's really hard to have that.

289
00:13:12.52 --> 00:13:18.32
I think we, I think the weenessial teams have that better than most people is just this

290
00:13:18.32 --> 00:13:23.08
autonomy to kind of make things happen and do kind of cool stuff.

291
00:13:23.08 --> 00:13:24.08
Yeah.

292
00:13:24.08 --> 00:13:29.12
And I'm not saying no, no one ever gets to do that, but you know, I don't think a regular

293
00:13:29.12 --> 00:13:34.58
army unit or regular Marine Corps unit would be putting, you know, seven surfboards on their

294
00:13:34.58 --> 00:13:35.58
payers.

295
00:13:35.58 --> 00:13:37.58
So where's the limit though?

296
00:13:37.58 --> 00:13:41.88
Like, so what, can I let's say we're going, can I get a, like a TV?

297
00:13:41.88 --> 00:13:42.88
Can I get a TV?

298
00:13:42.88 --> 00:13:43.88
Oh, you got a TV's.

299
00:13:43.88 --> 00:13:44.88
Big screen.

300
00:13:44.88 --> 00:13:45.88
Yeah.

301
00:13:45.88 --> 00:13:46.88
Yeah.

302
00:13:46.88 --> 00:13:47.88
Yeah.

303
00:13:47.88 --> 00:13:49.68
It just, it also depends on where you're deploying what you're doing, what the mission

304
00:13:49.68 --> 00:13:54.08
is, because, you know, my first time to Iraq, we didn't have much of any of the stuff.

305
00:13:54.08 --> 00:13:55.08
Obviously, right?

306
00:13:55.08 --> 00:13:57.64
We just had our opgier basically.

307
00:13:57.64 --> 00:14:02.40
And, but the second time, the second time I went to Iraq, we brought more, but we actually

308
00:14:02.40 --> 00:14:03.80
had to weld the squat rack.

309
00:14:03.80 --> 00:14:04.80
It's pretty awesome.

310
00:14:04.80 --> 00:14:09.36
There's a Marine, that there's a great Marine that was with us and he ran, he manned

311
00:14:09.36 --> 00:14:10.36
the radios.

312
00:14:10.36 --> 00:14:13.72
And he was just an awesome guy.

313
00:14:13.72 --> 00:14:19.20
And he was, he was a Marine, but there was Marines across the river.

314
00:14:19.20 --> 00:14:21.48
And so he was supposed to keep continuity.

315
00:14:21.48 --> 00:14:22.80
And he got assigned to us anyways.

316
00:14:22.80 --> 00:14:24.08
Awesome guy.

317
00:14:24.08 --> 00:14:26.28
And he knew how to weld.

318
00:14:26.28 --> 00:14:29.32
He, from a farm up in Montana or something.

319
00:14:29.32 --> 00:14:30.32
So he knew how to weld.

320
00:14:30.32 --> 00:14:32.56
And he had the gear and we didn't have a squat rack.

321
00:14:32.56 --> 00:14:35.92
And so our C-B's, because there's a bunch of C-B's with us too.

322
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:36.92
Oh, yeah.

323
00:14:36.92 --> 00:14:39.84
They got, they were able to, like, just come up with stuff.

324
00:14:39.84 --> 00:14:42.08
They, they make anything happen.

325
00:14:42.08 --> 00:14:46.16
My, my head, C-B was just, could, C-B, that's C-B's build things.

326
00:14:46.16 --> 00:14:49.32
And they also acquire things.

327
00:14:49.32 --> 00:14:50.32
Let me see.

328
00:14:50.32 --> 00:14:51.32
Let me see.

329
00:14:51.32 --> 00:14:53.92
It's a combat engineer battalion.

330
00:14:53.92 --> 00:14:54.92
It's a construction battalion.

331
00:14:54.92 --> 00:14:55.92
That's what it is.

332
00:14:55.92 --> 00:14:58.52
So it's C-B for short, but it's the C-B's.

333
00:14:58.52 --> 00:15:01.84
And, so yeah, they, they build things.

334
00:15:01.84 --> 00:15:04.16
And they also are very good at acquiring things.

335
00:15:04.16 --> 00:15:07.32
You know, things just show up at your, at your base.

336
00:15:07.32 --> 00:15:09.64
And my guys were awesome at acquiring things.

337
00:15:09.64 --> 00:15:13.96
And we didn't have a squat rack, which is crazy to me to have no squat rack, right?

338
00:15:13.96 --> 00:15:15.52
Why, why don't you have a squat rack?

339
00:15:15.52 --> 00:15:16.68
So yeah, that's what we're thinking of.

340
00:15:16.68 --> 00:15:18.48
This, this Marine weld at a squat rack.

341
00:15:18.48 --> 00:15:19.88
Now, here's the interesting part.

342
00:15:19.88 --> 00:15:22.52
The squat rack, he was, he was tall.

343
00:15:22.52 --> 00:15:25.000
He was like, maybe six, four, six, five.

344
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Maybe not that tall.

345
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
He's a main guy.

346
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.16
The Marine welder.

347
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:31.84
So on this squat rack, there was, you know, there's a adjustable,

348
00:15:31.84 --> 00:15:34.40
to put the bar on.

349
00:15:34.40 --> 00:15:35.68
Well, this didn't have adjustable things.

350
00:15:35.68 --> 00:15:37.40
It just had two hooks.

351
00:15:37.40 --> 00:15:39.32
And there was one hook at his height.

352
00:15:39.32 --> 00:15:40.84
Or one set of hooks at his height.

353
00:15:40.84 --> 00:15:42.08
And one set of hooks at my height.

354
00:15:42.08 --> 00:15:43.68
I've never just had to figure it out from there.

355
00:15:43.68 --> 00:15:45.68
So yeah.

356
00:15:45.68 --> 00:15:46.68
Yeah.

357
00:15:46.68 --> 00:15:47.68
But yeah.

358
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:49.96
So yeah, you could bring, you could bring that if you wanted to.

359
00:15:49.96 --> 00:15:52.12
And so, so yes, we brought mats.

360
00:15:52.12 --> 00:15:55.12
I brought mats on that deployment.

361
00:15:55.12 --> 00:15:57.92
And both actually, both my deployments to Iraq brought mats.

362
00:15:57.92 --> 00:16:01.64
And then, one of the class, like, well, generally you're trained with people that don't

363
00:16:01.64 --> 00:16:02.64
know anything.

364
00:16:02.64 --> 00:16:04.16
And I want to train with them and to work up.

365
00:16:04.16 --> 00:16:07.56
So they're starting to learn and they're like, you know, low level white belts or middle

366
00:16:07.56 --> 00:16:09.08
level white belts or even high level white belts.

367
00:16:09.08 --> 00:16:12.96
I don't know if I think we had one blue belt on the even one of my deployments.

368
00:16:12.96 --> 00:16:17.80
And the good thing is their team guys, their athletic, their strong, their good shape.

369
00:16:17.80 --> 00:16:18.80
They want to learn.

370
00:16:18.80 --> 00:16:21.32
So they learn fast, their tough.

371
00:16:21.32 --> 00:16:22.80
They're, like I said, strong and athletic.

372
00:16:22.80 --> 00:16:24.04
So you're going to get good roles.

373
00:16:24.04 --> 00:16:25.04
Yeah.

374
00:16:25.04 --> 00:16:27.04
I mean, what the more you teach them, the better the roles get.

375
00:16:27.04 --> 00:16:28.52
We're talking about gear, no gear.

376
00:16:28.52 --> 00:16:30.88
We never, I never traveled with a gear for the military.

377
00:16:30.88 --> 00:16:32.52
I don't think.

378
00:16:32.52 --> 00:16:37.52
And so, well, what I started wearing almost all time was cami pants.

379
00:16:37.52 --> 00:16:38.84
And a t-shirt.

380
00:16:38.84 --> 00:16:42.20
And what's cool is I did that when I, as soon as I started to get to our training with

381
00:16:42.20 --> 00:16:46.80
other seals that were in cami pants and a t-shirt.

382
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:49.88
Because it didn't make sense to wear like a cami top.

383
00:16:49.88 --> 00:16:54.56
And so what's cool is without even knowing it, when no one was training no

384
00:16:54.56 --> 00:16:58.96
ghee, I was actually training no ghee because I did, was just training with guys with t-shirts

385
00:16:58.96 --> 00:16:59.96
on.

386
00:16:59.96 --> 00:17:03.56
Not even wearing pants, but anyway, so yeah, that's where we'd wear cami pants and a

387
00:17:03.56 --> 00:17:04.56
t-shirt.

388
00:17:04.56 --> 00:17:12.72
And occasionally put on a hop gear occasionally, but, but not very often.

389
00:17:12.72 --> 00:17:17.84
The other thing you got to watch out for with my former organization in the Seal teams

390
00:17:17.84 --> 00:17:22.16
is there's guys that would go nuts, like they do on a tap because you get major egos.

391
00:17:22.16 --> 00:17:24.72
And so guys could occasionally go psycho.

392
00:17:24.72 --> 00:17:30.24
Sometimes when I'd pit certain people against each other, sometimes I'd have to basically

393
00:17:30.24 --> 00:17:35.52
officiate slash BSA, if the officer to make sure that no one actually got killed because

394
00:17:35.52 --> 00:17:37.80
they'd be trying to kill each other and no one wants to tap.

395
00:17:37.80 --> 00:17:40.96
And you have to say, hey man, you can't, you're about to, your arms about to get broken.

396
00:17:40.96 --> 00:17:41.96
Stop.

397
00:17:41.96 --> 00:17:44.80
So you had to do some of that.

398
00:17:44.80 --> 00:17:47.80
And I'm, I am a bit of an instigator.

399
00:17:47.80 --> 00:17:48.80
Yeah.

400
00:17:48.80 --> 00:17:52.12
I mean, you see it now, I still do it on the mats today.

401
00:17:52.12 --> 00:17:56.88
You know what I mean, if there's two guys that are going hard against each other, but

402
00:17:56.88 --> 00:17:59.000
maybe they're not going super hard.

403
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.68
It's really easy to escalate that.

405
00:18:01.68 --> 00:18:02.68
Yeah.

406
00:18:02.68 --> 00:18:03.68
Yeah, I know.

407
00:18:03.68 --> 00:18:09.60
And so I would escalate matches between guys as well.

408
00:18:09.60 --> 00:18:11.56
And then you know how to, I just roll with everyone.

409
00:18:11.56 --> 00:18:14.32
So yeah, with the world of the class, be like, we teach the moves just like a drag

410
00:18:14.32 --> 00:18:18.52
energy to two class, teach the moves, go over some stuff, and then roll.

411
00:18:18.52 --> 00:18:19.92
And that's it.

412
00:18:19.92 --> 00:18:20.92
Pretty simple.

413
00:18:20.92 --> 00:18:21.92
Good times.

414
00:18:21.92 --> 00:18:27.56
Yeah, I found that if you can do little drills with yourself, if you're a high level guy,

415
00:18:27.56 --> 00:18:31.28
and you're going with the white belt, especially if they're athletic, what you do is,

416
00:18:31.28 --> 00:18:36.16
you know how like when you roll with a guy who's maybe one level, who'll give or take

417
00:18:36.16 --> 00:18:42.68
from you, you, or let's say they're one level or you'll kind of slowly put yourself into

418
00:18:42.68 --> 00:18:44.40
batter or worse situations.

419
00:18:44.40 --> 00:18:46.20
You won't go all out or nothing like it.

420
00:18:46.20 --> 00:18:47.20
Yeah.

421
00:18:47.20 --> 00:18:48.20
But this is kind of counterintuitive.

422
00:18:48.20 --> 00:18:53.20
If you go with like a beginner beginner, but they're athletic, what you do is you

423
00:18:53.20 --> 00:18:57.96
try to, you think of a finish or a position.

424
00:18:57.96 --> 00:18:59.80
Yeah, as fast as you possibly can.

425
00:18:59.80 --> 00:19:00.80
Oh.

426
00:19:00.80 --> 00:19:02.12
So if you're like, okay, I'm going to start in the box.

427
00:19:02.12 --> 00:19:03.32
So you're going to force something.

428
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:05.32
No, no, well, depends on what you're going to do.

429
00:19:05.32 --> 00:19:06.32
You're going to force it.

430
00:19:06.32 --> 00:19:07.32
Yeah.

431
00:19:07.32 --> 00:19:10.32
But if you're going to force an arm lock, if you say I'm going to finish this with an arm

432
00:19:10.32 --> 00:19:11.72
lock, you're going to have to force him into that position.

433
00:19:11.72 --> 00:19:12.72
Somewhat.

434
00:19:12.72 --> 00:19:13.72
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:19:13.72 --> 00:19:14.72
I mean, you can set it up, sure.

436
00:19:14.72 --> 00:19:15.72
Yeah, exactly.

437
00:19:15.72 --> 00:19:18.20
That's what that's really the drill is you got to set it up, given what he does.

438
00:19:18.20 --> 00:19:20.56
And he could be retreating the whole time.

439
00:19:20.56 --> 00:19:21.56
Sure, it's going to take longer.

440
00:19:21.56 --> 00:19:23.20
It's just, that's just how it should you do.

441
00:19:23.20 --> 00:19:29.04
But that's the drill in your head, rather than, you know, let's say an intuitive method

442
00:19:29.04 --> 00:19:31.64
to roll with a white belt is let's just go light.

443
00:19:31.64 --> 00:19:32.64
Let's see what he does.

444
00:19:32.64 --> 00:19:35.84
Let him get a good position on you and then a workout of it.

445
00:19:35.84 --> 00:19:36.84
But no, don't do that.

446
00:19:36.84 --> 00:19:40.72
Be like, okay, I'm going to treat this person like a person that I have to in real life

447
00:19:40.72 --> 00:19:43.08
subdue with and you choose whatever way.

448
00:19:43.08 --> 00:19:44.08
That's a good game to play.

449
00:19:44.08 --> 00:19:46.000
Actually, that is a good game to play.

450
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.36
And then you get real good at that.

451
00:19:47.36 --> 00:19:51.52
Like, going from one thing and then it's also I don't play that game.

452
00:19:51.52 --> 00:19:54.80
Very often, I don't know what, there's something that snaps in my head sometimes when I'm like,

453
00:19:54.80 --> 00:19:58.08
okay, I'm going to just smash this person.

454
00:19:58.08 --> 00:20:02.40
But you know, sometimes I'll be watching the clock and when there's 40 seconds left,

455
00:20:02.40 --> 00:20:04.84
I'll be like, I'm really trying to submit this due to the next 40 seconds.

456
00:20:04.84 --> 00:20:07.000
Or this is when I'm going against someone that's good.

457
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
You know what I mean?

458
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.24
I honestly, I do that with you sometimes, where you can feel me chilling and I'm all

459
00:20:11.24 --> 00:20:15.12
of some of them like, oh wait, there's 30 seconds left and I have to go super hard to

460
00:20:15.12 --> 00:20:17.60
try and get you and sometimes I don't get myself enough time.

461
00:20:17.60 --> 00:20:22.20
That's the thing that I have to learn to get better.

462
00:20:22.20 --> 00:20:26.16
And yeah, me saying that, uh, agree, like, I don't do that in training.

463
00:20:26.16 --> 00:20:32.88
Because what I firmly, my lazy instinct is I always go just enough better than the

464
00:20:32.88 --> 00:20:35.72
person I'm going against to maintain and eventually finish.

465
00:20:35.72 --> 00:20:38.60
See, and that's good because you give the other guy good training.

466
00:20:38.60 --> 00:20:39.60
Yeah.

467
00:20:39.60 --> 00:20:42.16
And that's kind of the point with not, you don't want, if you go in regular Jesus

468
00:20:42.16 --> 00:20:45.72
class and you're like, you know, upper belt mean like purple brown black belt and you

469
00:20:45.72 --> 00:20:49.08
go against a white belt, you can pair it up with a white belt.

470
00:20:49.08 --> 00:20:54.000
I'm not saying necessarily to do that all the time because it's kind of, you kind of,

471
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.28
it's a relationship you have with your training partners.

472
00:20:56.28 --> 00:21:00.28
So if I'm like, okay, every white belt I go against or any beginner, I'm just going

473
00:21:00.28 --> 00:21:01.28
to go as hard again.

474
00:21:01.28 --> 00:21:02.84
It's like, bro, what are you doing to the guy?

475
00:21:02.84 --> 00:21:03.84
Sure.

476
00:21:03.84 --> 00:21:04.84
Good.

477
00:21:04.84 --> 00:21:08.84
That's why that's why for what you're saying for blue belts to do that is not good.

478
00:21:08.84 --> 00:21:11.04
For blue, that's why belts they don't have the skill yet.

479
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:12.04
Yeah.

480
00:21:12.04 --> 00:21:13.04
That's true too.

481
00:21:13.04 --> 00:21:14.52
It should be like purple, brown belt black belt.

482
00:21:14.52 --> 00:21:15.52
Yeah.

483
00:21:15.52 --> 00:21:19.56
That's going to be like, okay, I'm going to test my efficiency on making this happen

484
00:21:19.56 --> 00:21:20.56
really quickly.

485
00:21:20.56 --> 00:21:21.56
Yeah.

486
00:21:21.56 --> 00:21:25.20
Blue belt against a athletic white belt is going to be World War 7.

487
00:21:25.20 --> 00:21:26.20
Yeah.

488
00:21:26.20 --> 00:21:27.20
That's true.

489
00:21:27.20 --> 00:21:29.20
And there's injuries that are waiting to happen.

490
00:21:29.20 --> 00:21:30.20
Yeah.

491
00:21:30.20 --> 00:21:31.72
There's a purple belt generally is not going to get it injured.

492
00:21:31.72 --> 00:21:34.44
Not going to generally injure someone from being in a bad position.

493
00:21:34.44 --> 00:21:35.68
Blue belt white belt.

494
00:21:35.68 --> 00:21:36.68
Maybe it could be.

495
00:21:36.68 --> 00:21:37.68
Yeah.

496
00:21:37.68 --> 00:21:38.68
It's a bad scenario.

497
00:21:38.68 --> 00:21:39.68
Yeah.

498
00:21:39.68 --> 00:21:43.84
And so really the point in doing that is like in a scenario like your situation where you

499
00:21:43.84 --> 00:21:47.92
don't have anyone to train with except for beginners that are all athletic and hungry.

500
00:21:47.92 --> 00:21:50.16
So it's like, okay, what do I do?

501
00:21:50.16 --> 00:21:51.16
You know what's cool?

502
00:21:51.16 --> 00:21:55.24
I would come home from deployment better at GJ2 than when I left.

503
00:21:55.24 --> 00:21:56.24
For sure.

504
00:21:56.24 --> 00:21:57.24
That happened on every deployment.

505
00:21:57.24 --> 00:22:00.24
When I came home, I was better at GJ2 than when I left.

506
00:22:00.24 --> 00:22:04.88
But not only better than I was, but I was in keeping with the standards of the guys

507
00:22:04.88 --> 00:22:05.88
I was training with.

508
00:22:05.88 --> 00:22:06.88
Yeah.

509
00:22:06.88 --> 00:22:09.88
So, you know, I'm rolling with Dean before I leave.

510
00:22:09.88 --> 00:22:16.76
And I come back and I am now doing better than I was against Dean before I left.

511
00:22:16.76 --> 00:22:18.24
He's been here training the whole time.

512
00:22:18.24 --> 00:22:22.12
So that says to me, that is an effective way to train.

513
00:22:22.12 --> 00:22:25.28
You know, you just, you just, and that's why there's really no excuse to lie.

514
00:22:25.28 --> 00:22:26.28
People ask, you know, what should I do?

515
00:22:26.28 --> 00:22:30.24
I live four hours away from the closest gym and get some friends, put some mats on the

516
00:22:30.24 --> 00:22:33.88
ground, watch YouTube, and start training with each other.

517
00:22:33.88 --> 00:22:37.84
And occasionally when you get the chance, go somewhere to a school once a month, once

518
00:22:37.84 --> 00:22:38.84
every two weeks.

519
00:22:38.84 --> 00:22:39.84
Good morning.

520
00:22:39.84 --> 00:22:40.84
Yeah.

521
00:22:40.84 --> 00:22:41.84
Yeah.

522
00:22:41.84 --> 00:22:47.44
And I think in your situation is kind of a, not necessarily unique, but kind of a specific

523
00:22:47.44 --> 00:22:52.12
type of situation where you have all the fundamentals essentially down.

524
00:22:52.12 --> 00:22:57.60
So, you know, like habitual stuff that you just automatically do with certain techniques,

525
00:22:57.60 --> 00:22:59.84
which is the correct technique, you know.

526
00:22:59.84 --> 00:23:04.96
So, you, I think that you'll benefit more in that way, where you can train with beginners

527
00:23:04.96 --> 00:23:05.96
and train so when you get to know.

528
00:23:05.96 --> 00:23:08.80
But I'm talking about when I was a blue belt myself.

529
00:23:08.80 --> 00:23:11.04
I still got a lot better when I would be on deployment.

530
00:23:11.04 --> 00:23:12.04
Yeah.

531
00:23:12.04 --> 00:23:14.04
And when I was a purple belt when I was a brown belt, you know.

532
00:23:14.04 --> 00:23:15.04
Yeah.

533
00:23:15.04 --> 00:23:19.40
Still still, it's just like a little just a smaller version of that idea where if you're

534
00:23:19.40 --> 00:23:23.08
beginner and you're like, okay, I've never taken you to the start on YouTube or whatever,

535
00:23:23.08 --> 00:23:24.96
I don't think you can benefit those situations.

536
00:23:24.96 --> 00:23:26.80
Oh, no, you can definitely benefit from them.

537
00:23:26.80 --> 00:23:27.80
Not as much.

538
00:23:27.80 --> 00:23:30.76
You can't, yeah, you can definitely not as much, but you can benefit.

539
00:23:30.76 --> 00:23:32.56
You can definitely benefit.

540
00:23:32.56 --> 00:23:33.56
You can definitely benefit.

541
00:23:33.56 --> 00:23:34.56
Yeah.

542
00:23:34.56 --> 00:23:35.56
It's better.

543
00:23:35.56 --> 00:23:38.04
It's a thousand times better than not doing anything and not training.

544
00:23:38.04 --> 00:23:39.04
Oh, yeah.

545
00:23:39.04 --> 00:23:43.20
And if you got one person that has that gift of being able to like understand what's

546
00:23:43.20 --> 00:23:45.80
happening, maybe got a wrestler in there, but that's going to help you so much.

547
00:23:45.80 --> 00:23:48.52
Maybe you got someone that did judo, maybe that's going to help you so much.

548
00:23:48.52 --> 00:23:51.12
But even if you know, you just start looking at it and saying, okay, what's happening

549
00:23:51.12 --> 00:23:52.12
in this, what's happening?

550
00:23:52.12 --> 00:23:55.32
Like, okay, try that on Mark on me and you get some of those good YouTube videos that

551
00:23:55.32 --> 00:23:56.56
really break things down well.

552
00:23:56.56 --> 00:23:57.56
Yeah.

553
00:23:57.56 --> 00:23:58.56
You can learn a lot.

554
00:23:58.56 --> 00:24:00.96
I think you can, because I didn't have to learn that way, luckily.

555
00:24:00.96 --> 00:24:04.72
Yeah, luckily you got to train with the best guys in the whole entire world.

556
00:24:04.72 --> 00:24:06.80
So, you know, hey, you know, teach their own.

557
00:24:06.80 --> 00:24:15.44
Yeah, actually, yeah, actually, had your Gracie who's, you know, we not even arguably,

558
00:24:15.44 --> 00:24:18.24
talk three all-time ever.

559
00:24:18.24 --> 00:24:23.72
He and he was actually telling me, he's like, I don't have like a team of world

560
00:24:23.72 --> 00:24:24.88
class guys to train with.

561
00:24:24.88 --> 00:24:27.52
He's like sometimes I train with Brailleil sometimes.

562
00:24:27.52 --> 00:24:28.52
Because he's an English.

563
00:24:28.52 --> 00:24:33.08
Yeah, so he has like, he's like, I only train with my students and who are good and

564
00:24:33.08 --> 00:24:36.04
they give off some training, but they're not, I don't have world class training partners.

565
00:24:36.04 --> 00:24:38.32
Like, my opponents do kind of thing.

566
00:24:38.32 --> 00:24:39.32
Yeah.

567
00:24:39.32 --> 00:24:41.32
And there was always a good job.

568
00:24:41.32 --> 00:24:42.32
That was kind of amazing.

569
00:24:42.32 --> 00:24:43.32
Yeah.

570
00:24:43.32 --> 00:24:47.76
So man, to kind of teach their own, but all these things, yeah, can be beneficial even

571
00:24:47.76 --> 00:24:49.36
even if they don't necessarily seem like it.

572
00:24:49.36 --> 00:24:50.36
Yeah.

573
00:24:50.36 --> 00:24:54.24
And you know what I think actually, this is leading to, it's like, you get what you

574
00:24:54.24 --> 00:24:55.24
make out of it.

575
00:24:55.24 --> 00:24:56.24
Yeah.

576
00:24:56.24 --> 00:24:57.24
Exactly.

577
00:24:57.24 --> 00:24:59.24
And there's people in the UFC that have done the same thing that came from some random

578
00:24:59.24 --> 00:25:03.04
camp and they're training hard and they go and win.

579
00:25:03.04 --> 00:25:04.36
The connoomer Grecker.

580
00:25:04.36 --> 00:25:06.96
He didn't come from, he didn't come from Greg Jackson.

581
00:25:06.96 --> 00:25:07.96
Yeah.

582
00:25:07.96 --> 00:25:10.28
He didn't come from American top team.

583
00:25:10.28 --> 00:25:14.32
He came from a, you know, their school with, with Kevin on.

584
00:25:14.32 --> 00:25:16.48
And obviously doing something right.

585
00:25:16.48 --> 00:25:20.36
But same thing, he didn't have the highest level guys to train against.

586
00:25:20.36 --> 00:25:24.32
He trained, I'm not saying slagging off their training partners, but it's not, it wasn't

587
00:25:24.32 --> 00:25:26.44
a known camp when he came around.

588
00:25:26.44 --> 00:25:29.72
He's, so he's a guy like that.

589
00:25:29.72 --> 00:25:31.04
Max all the way.

590
00:25:31.04 --> 00:25:32.04
He's out, how are you?

591
00:25:32.04 --> 00:25:33.04
Right?

592
00:25:33.04 --> 00:25:34.04
He's training hard.

593
00:25:34.04 --> 00:25:38.40
He's coming out here winning the UFC championship based on, you know, his training

594
00:25:38.40 --> 00:25:39.40
partners.

595
00:25:39.40 --> 00:25:46.60
So I think guys that that actually understand what they need to do, they do it, they

596
00:25:46.60 --> 00:25:47.60
get it done.

597
00:25:47.60 --> 00:25:48.60
They don't make any excuses.

598
00:25:48.60 --> 00:25:49.60
They don't make any excuses.

599
00:25:49.60 --> 00:25:50.60
They don't make any excuses.

600
00:25:50.60 --> 00:25:51.60
Yeah.

601
00:25:51.60 --> 00:25:52.60
Yeah.

602
00:25:52.60 --> 00:25:53.60
You have a hand to the day.

603
00:25:53.60 --> 00:25:54.60
That's it.

604
00:25:54.60 --> 00:25:55.60
Check.

605
00:25:55.60 --> 00:25:58.12
Next question.

606
00:25:58.12 --> 00:26:03.84
With life decisions is it better to be decisive and take actions to move

607
00:26:03.84 --> 00:26:08.12
forward, even if sometimes those decisions are wrong, as opposed to being paralyzed by

608
00:26:08.12 --> 00:26:12.16
indecision and fear, thus getting maneuvered on by life.

609
00:26:12.16 --> 00:26:17.28
I ask this because I struggle with life decisions and have trouble committing to one path

610
00:26:17.28 --> 00:26:21.12
duty, eclectic interests.

611
00:26:21.12 --> 00:26:24.56
After listening to your podcast, I'm thinking it's better to be aggressive and maneuver

612
00:26:24.56 --> 00:26:29.44
on the battlefield of life as long as I'm prepared to adapt rather than sitting around

613
00:26:29.44 --> 00:26:32.48
and letting circumstances dictate my actions.

614
00:26:32.48 --> 00:26:35.80
Well, it sounds like he kind of answered his own question there.

615
00:26:35.80 --> 00:26:36.80
Which is good.

616
00:26:36.80 --> 00:26:37.80
Yes.

617
00:26:37.80 --> 00:26:38.80
It is better to be aggressive.

618
00:26:38.80 --> 00:26:40.72
It's better to be decisive.

619
00:26:40.72 --> 00:26:42.44
This does not mean burning bridges.

620
00:26:42.44 --> 00:26:44.08
And I think we've talked about this before.

621
00:26:44.08 --> 00:26:49.52
It doesn't mean that you just say, I'm quitting my job right now because I'm going to

622
00:26:49.52 --> 00:26:55.04
start a new life as a whatever your new job is going to be.

623
00:26:55.04 --> 00:26:57.72
I'm going to start a business selling widgets.

624
00:26:57.72 --> 00:26:59.96
And I'm just going to go all in because I'm committed.

625
00:26:59.96 --> 00:27:00.96
Sure.

626
00:27:00.96 --> 00:27:03.16
Well, you know, how long has it takes to produce those widgets?

627
00:27:03.16 --> 00:27:05.60
And so there's a lot of issues with that.

628
00:27:05.60 --> 00:27:10.72
You know, there's a way though to mitigate risk on your decisions.

629
00:27:10.72 --> 00:27:16.32
And actually at the at the camp, we were in up in Maine, there's a lot of guys that were

630
00:27:16.32 --> 00:27:18.32
you know, listening to the podcast.

631
00:27:18.32 --> 00:27:23.56
And one of them really good, really good guy.

632
00:27:23.56 --> 00:27:25.48
He was talking to me about his business.

633
00:27:25.48 --> 00:27:28.92
And the business, which I'm not going to go any details, but he's basically saying, look,

634
00:27:28.92 --> 00:27:33.16
I got this business. It's going well. I want it to do better.

635
00:27:33.16 --> 00:27:38.52
And I'm kind of weighing this decision between bringing on.

636
00:27:38.52 --> 00:27:44.12
He says, I want to bring on like six people to really help expand and grow and all that stuff.

637
00:27:44.12 --> 00:27:48.40
He said, but if I do that, and we have a couple rough, you know, if we hit some bad luck,

638
00:27:48.40 --> 00:27:51.72
I might be upside down and not be able to handle it.

639
00:27:51.72 --> 00:27:56.04
And what I really am scared of is like, that's not just me, but it's now it's my family.

640
00:27:56.04 --> 00:28:03.40
I got a wife and I got kids. And now I'm hedging the comfort and safety of my family.

641
00:28:03.40 --> 00:28:09.64
So I don't know what to do. And I said, OK, well, do you have to go all in?

642
00:28:09.64 --> 00:28:12.60
Right? Do you have to turn around tomorrow and go, you know what?

643
00:28:12.60 --> 00:28:15.96
We're going all in. I'm going to hire these six people. We're going to expand and hopefully

644
00:28:15.96 --> 00:28:20.28
everything goes right. We'll do really well. You don't have to do that.

645
00:28:20.28 --> 00:28:22.52
You don't have to put that much on the table.

646
00:28:22.52 --> 00:28:26.84
Instead, I said, well, how many people do you actually really need right now?

647
00:28:27.88 --> 00:28:33.48
And he said, probably one or two. And I was like, OK, why don't you bring on one?

648
00:28:34.44 --> 00:28:39.96
And start to see where that goes and be prepared to look for another person to bring on too.

649
00:28:39.96 --> 00:28:44.36
And then as those two people work out and you're starting to fill their labor every day and

650
00:28:44.36 --> 00:28:48.76
they have work to do because you're expanding the cool, bring on three. And guess what?

651
00:28:48.76 --> 00:28:53.32
If you hit a hiccup and things start going sideways for whatever reason, that's cool.

652
00:28:53.32 --> 00:28:56.92
You don't have those additional four people or three people on board that you're paying

653
00:28:56.92 --> 00:29:01.24
payroll to every month, which is normally what kills businesses or one of the common things that

654
00:29:01.24 --> 00:29:07.80
kills businesses. So it's the same. So that's a good example. Right? And he was, he thought to himself

655
00:29:07.80 --> 00:29:13.000
and he loved to me and said, absolutely, I'm going to go do that. And so he's probably back at his

656
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.12
job right now, running his business and probably hiring a person to start expanding. Not hiring six

657
00:29:18.12 --> 00:29:22.84
people and putting all of his chips on the table where it's a cool gamble, let's say the

658
00:29:22.84 --> 00:29:27.40
percentage of winning, winning is 70%, you're like, yeah, I'm just going to do it. There's a 30%

659
00:29:27.40 --> 00:29:32.84
chance you'll lose and now your family has no house and no food. So that's not what we want to do.

660
00:29:32.84 --> 00:29:38.04
So why not just put some of your chips on the table and you can still win and make a little bit.

661
00:29:38.04 --> 00:29:43.000
You still, you still improve your position. So we got to do that with life too. Like I said,

662
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.04
you don't quit your job to start building widgets when you don't know what you're doing.

663
00:29:46.04 --> 00:29:49.40
You got to, why not just build the widgets in your spare time? Yeah, see what I don't.

664
00:29:49.40 --> 00:29:52.60
Yeah, start putting those things on the internet, start seeing how they sell, start getting a little

665
00:29:52.60 --> 00:29:57.32
income from them, let them grow and then finally when you feel like the balance start to tip,

666
00:29:57.32 --> 00:30:00.84
maybe they'll be a last minute jump where you'd be like, okay, now I'm going to go for it.

667
00:30:01.48 --> 00:30:05.88
But what you're committing to is something solid, something tangible and something that's making money.

668
00:30:06.44 --> 00:30:10.60
Right? We're not jumping in and committing to something that's an unknown. We're going to commit

669
00:30:10.60 --> 00:30:16.44
something to something that's known and I think it's important to note that that right there

670
00:30:17.80 --> 00:30:23.80
is not a lack of commitment. And this is, yeah, here these like, you know, people on the interwebs,

671
00:30:24.36 --> 00:30:28.12
they'll be like, you know, why you have a made a get? Because you have a committed 100%.

672
00:30:28.12 --> 00:30:32.92
That's why you, if you want to do it, you got to commit with everything you've got. Well, and so

673
00:30:32.92 --> 00:30:35.80
what people think is, okay, well, I'm just going to quit my job because I'm going to go for a

674
00:30:35.80 --> 00:30:40.76
commit and then I'll be successful because this guy over here told me, if I committed, I'd be successful. It's actually not true.

675
00:30:41.24 --> 00:30:45.72
You can be a thousand percent committed to something and you can still fail. I got bad news for you. That's the

676
00:30:45.72 --> 00:30:51.96
reality. You know, that's the reality of, do you think that people at Blackberry weren't committed to their game? You know what I mean?

677
00:30:52.52 --> 00:30:58.28
You know, but what happened to Blackberry? It's, they were, they were committed, but they made some bad

678
00:30:58.28 --> 00:31:03.48
decisions. The guess what? Now, Blackberry is not really in the game anymore. Well, they I think they changed games. I'm not 100% sure.

679
00:31:03.48 --> 00:31:12.60
But people think that that because you didn't quit your job and go all in and put all your chips on the

680
00:31:12.60 --> 00:31:18.04
table that you're not committed and I actually don't want to agree with that. And I'll get, here's my example.

681
00:31:19.40 --> 00:31:29.24
If, okay, I think that commitment is actually harder to do when it's a long term

682
00:31:29.24 --> 00:31:34.84
commitment that you're going, okay, you know what? I'm going to, I'm going to stay at my job, but I'm going to work three hours a day on this other thing.

683
00:31:34.84 --> 00:31:39.08
I'm going to be manufacturing, maybe making my widgets three hours a day when I get home at 10 o'clock at night.

684
00:31:39.08 --> 00:31:43.48
I'm going to go until one o'clock in the morning, making my widgets. That's commitment.

685
00:31:44.28 --> 00:31:50.68
It's actually smart commitment. It actually, in some ways, takes more commitment to do that than it does just to quit your job and say, I'm all in.

686
00:31:51.08 --> 00:31:56.76
Because now you're holding your balancing on these different things. You're carrying your shouldering more of a burden. So that actually takes more commitment.

687
00:31:56.76 --> 00:32:05.16
The problem is that people, they, they get weak and after the fourth night of making widgets at 10 o'clock at night, they go, yeah, I am not.

688
00:32:05.16 --> 00:32:13.56
I'm good. It's cool. I have a job. I have a job. Yeah. And so that's weak. You know, an example, be, what if you could get in

689
00:32:15.40 --> 00:32:23.56
excellent physical condition in three hours, but it was just like the hardest three hours

690
00:32:23.56 --> 00:32:34.44
that you could imagine. Think about that. And your body would transform from whatever crap condition you're in right now into

691
00:32:35.32 --> 00:32:43.48
a specimen and it's going to take three hours of just hell. How many more people would be an amazing condition?

692
00:32:46.04 --> 00:32:52.12
I think a ton more because committing for three hours to something, even there was going to be super bad. People would be able to do it.

693
00:32:52.12 --> 00:33:00.20
What takes more commitment and the reason everyone's not walking around like a perfect specimen is because it doesn't take three hours.

694
00:33:00.20 --> 00:33:12.60
It doesn't take three weeks. It doesn't take three months. It takes a daily grind that goes on for years that you have to hold the line on on the way you eat, on the way you exercise, on your life.

695
00:33:13.16 --> 00:33:19.40
And that takes real commitment. Yes. So it isn't a lack of commitment. It's planning.

696
00:33:19.40 --> 00:33:32.04
It isn't a lack of commitment. It is mitigating risk. And don't confuse again. I think that the person that commits to something and still maintains this other income stream.

697
00:33:32.04 --> 00:33:40.76
For example, that person is at least as committed. If not more committed, then the person says, you know what, screw it. I'm going all in over here. I'm forgetting about, you know, quitting my job.

698
00:33:40.76 --> 00:33:51.56
But that's not a smart move. And it takes more. That's actually an easier way. That's my point. It's easier in many ways to go, you know what? I'm quitting this day job. I'm quitting my nine to five.

699
00:33:51.56 --> 00:33:59.000
I'm sick of that cubicle. I'm sick of that construction site. I'm just going all in over here. That is an easier move that takes less commitment.

700
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:11.80
Then saying I'm going to shoulder the burden of working 15, 18, 20 hours a day for the next two years until I can get this thing stood up enough to where I can execute it.

701
00:34:11.80 --> 00:34:16.92
Yeah. Yes. It's almost like people are conflating the commitment. You know, it's like that.

702
00:34:16.92 --> 00:34:24.68
Almost people want to want to do a big show of commitment by quitting their job. But it's more of just a show of commitment.

703
00:34:24.68 --> 00:34:33.32
It's even your commitment or you're not kind of thing. Yeah. And then so a lot of times with these big shows of commitment comes just an immense amount of stupidity.

704
00:34:33.32 --> 00:34:40.52
You know, yeah. Yeah. When mean while you can either commit or don't commit, you know, yeah, sure. If you don't quit your job and you make widgets.

705
00:34:41.40 --> 00:34:52.60
And you don't commit sure. It's like, all right, you got you can facilitate your non-commitment. Yeah. Yeah, I dig your real job. You're nine to five jobs in the neighborhood to you not committing. Yeah.

706
00:34:52.60 --> 00:35:01.88
Fully. Yeah. But by no means is that, you know, proof. Yeah. Yeah. And it's important to note that don't confuse.

707
00:35:02.84 --> 00:35:09.72
And this is another mistake. So people make mistakes on either ends of the spectrum. The other one is don't confuse planning and mitigating risk

708
00:35:10.44 --> 00:35:17.40
with not taking action because that can happen too. You have to make things happen every single day. That's what you have to do.

709
00:35:17.40 --> 00:35:24.76
If you don't take action, if you don't move, which is what this guy's asking about, then yeah, you're paralyzed and you're never going to get anywhere.

710
00:35:24.76 --> 00:35:30.28
But all you have to do is chip away if that thing. You got to make a little bit of movement every day. Yeah. You want to write a book.

711
00:35:30.28 --> 00:35:35.48
And this is something I'm familiar with now because I'm writing books and writing another book right now. Yeah. And you know what I got to do.

712
00:35:35.48 --> 00:35:39.000
I got to chip away if that thing every day. Every day. Yeah. Every day.

713
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:49.16
There's a comment. Thousands of words a day. 45 minutes. Maybe an hour. That's what it takes. And guess what? If I can't get that hour for whatever reason, guess what I'm going to get.

714
00:35:49.16 --> 00:35:57.16
To 20 minutes. I'm going to get 30 minutes. I'm going to get something to get in the room to do work because I'm going to be close to my golden. I was.

715
00:35:57.72 --> 00:36:06.04
Yeah. That's the way it is. Yeah, man. And I think you got to see that live. Didn't you? Yes. You know, honor like it was my honor.

716
00:36:06.04 --> 00:36:14.68
That's, but that's where it happens. Where else is it going to happen? Right? Yeah. We were flying back from Maine.

717
00:36:14.68 --> 00:36:20.68
I was, you know, echo's cruising good. Yeah. I think I fell asleep a couple times. Yeah. Yeah. You were kind of in it.

718
00:36:20.68 --> 00:36:27.56
I was hammering. I was doing what I have to do. Because if I don't do it then, when is that when I'm going to get that hour?

719
00:36:27.56 --> 00:36:34.12
That was I was four hours I had right there flight technically five. Yeah. Couldn't get my computer out for the first little bit.

720
00:36:34.12 --> 00:36:41.72
Oh, yeah. There. Let you. So whatever. Oh, good. Yeah. I was kind of at times. Let's peek you know if you're shoulder like reading. Oh, it's not going right.

721
00:36:41.72 --> 00:36:48.76
You know, we're here. Then I see. Oh, what was it? I saw the name Kenny Williams in in there. Oh, no. Oh, no.

722
00:36:48.76 --> 00:36:53.40
I know a jockel's right in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, too. This good man. Be composed.

723
00:36:53.96 --> 00:37:00.12
Yeah. I think that all that sounds like kind of obvious, you know, when you're saying it. I'm like, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

724
00:37:00.12 --> 00:37:05.48
Got it or you know, or at least the part where it's like it's a daily thing. Like you've got to have a

725
00:37:06.20 --> 00:37:09.000
progress, you know, like you've got to take that step, you know, do it.

726
00:37:09.96 --> 00:37:14.04
Sounds obvious, but man how many times did I know this like my friends and

727
00:37:15.32 --> 00:37:21.000
whatever, you go on, I don't know, online or whatever and you see people complaining in the about, you know,

728
00:37:22.28 --> 00:37:29.000
stuff never happens for me, you know, FML, you know, FML means stuff never happens to you. That's right.

729
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.36
And stuff never happens for you. That's right. Yeah. That is life. Yeah. It doesn't happen for you in life. Yeah.

730
00:37:34.36 --> 00:37:40.04
You got to go and make it. I've explained to my kids. You want to make money. You have to take that

731
00:37:40.04 --> 00:37:44.04
money from someone else. You have to take it from them. People are just going to walk up and give you money.

732
00:37:44.04 --> 00:37:47.000
Yeah. Right. That doesn't happen. That's never happened to me in my life.

733
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.92
Known as ever walked up and given me money. Yeah. You got to take that.

734
00:37:50.92 --> 00:37:56.36
But they got to give it to you. They got to make them. You got to take it from them. Yeah.

735
00:37:56.36 --> 00:38:00.76
They want that money, too. So what are you going to give them? That's going to make allow you to take it from them.

736
00:38:00.76 --> 00:38:06.76
Yeah. That. So yeah. Guess what? Nothing's nothing happens for you. That's right. Nothing does happen for you.

737
00:38:06.76 --> 00:38:11.72
You have to make it happen. Yeah. That's the default aggressive mindset that you are going to make things happen.

738
00:38:11.72 --> 00:38:14.52
Not going to sit around and wait for things to happen. It's not going to happen.

739
00:38:16.04 --> 00:38:21.40
Yeah. It's not going to happen. Oh, well, guess what? I read a story about this such and such a person.

740
00:38:21.40 --> 00:38:27.24
And they just walked into this agency and they thought they looked did a really good job.

741
00:38:27.24 --> 00:38:32.68
And now their famous is okay. That's great. Basher life on that percentage chance of happening.

742
00:38:32.68 --> 00:38:37.72
It's not happening. Yeah. I actually look at that and just think the chance of anything like that

743
00:38:37.72 --> 00:38:41.000
happening to me are zero. Nothing good is going to happen to me like that.

744
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.44
That I'm just going to get a good deal like that. It's not happening. Zero. Yeah.

745
00:38:44.44 --> 00:38:49.24
So if you're going to get it, you're going to have to make it happen. Yeah. Next question.

746
00:38:49.24 --> 00:38:52.76
Yes, that should be the red flag right there then.

747
00:38:52.76 --> 00:38:58.84
Right. Basically for someone who's like, no, you know, when am I going to get my big break or

748
00:38:58.84 --> 00:39:02.60
or nothing happens for me kind of thing. That should be the red flag right.

749
00:39:02.60 --> 00:39:08.20
One is like, yeah, it seems more of a journey you're talking about the fact that you're not

750
00:39:08.20 --> 00:39:11.64
that things aren't coming to you. Yeah. Yeah. That should be a real big red flag.

751
00:39:11.64 --> 00:39:18.60
Nothing is going to come to you. Not happening. Not happening. You got to go and make things happen.

752
00:39:19.24 --> 00:39:22.60
And once you have that attitude, I'll tell you what it's a game changer. Yeah.

753
00:39:22.60 --> 00:39:26.28
It's a game changer. Once you realize that that book that's so good that's in your head,

754
00:39:26.28 --> 00:39:30.36
it's not going to write itself. Yeah. Once you realize that widget that you have this plan for,

755
00:39:30.36 --> 00:39:35.40
isn't going to build itself, then you'll realize like, okay, I'm going to have to make these things

756
00:39:35.40 --> 00:39:39.56
happen. Yeah. And even then, guess what? You can make a widget that no one wants to buy. And you can

757
00:39:39.56 --> 00:39:43.88
write a book that no one wants to, no one wants to read. And if you're not okay with that,

758
00:39:44.52 --> 00:39:48.36
which is another thing that happens. People say, well, you know, no one will like it.

759
00:39:49.16 --> 00:39:53.40
Okay. Well, if that's what you think, well, then don't even write it unless you want to write it for yourself.

760
00:39:54.12 --> 00:39:58.52
Then write it for yourself. And cool. Be proud. Be stoked. Be happy. Yeah. Let's

761
00:39:58.52 --> 00:40:04.36
interesting. Let's say a book book, right? For example. It, this kind of reminds me of where,

762
00:40:04.36 --> 00:40:08.60
you know, how let's say, I don't know me. I'm a, let's say, oh, I'm a pretty good writer. In fact,

763
00:40:08.60 --> 00:40:14.84
I even wrote a book before, whatever. And then my friend on Instagram face, whatever,

764
00:40:14.84 --> 00:40:20.04
someone, my neighbor, whatever. They write a book and they, they release it. And then they write another one.

765
00:40:20.04 --> 00:40:23.88
And let's say it's not even really that good, but it's out there. They're like, look at my new

766
00:40:23.88 --> 00:40:27.88
book and, you know, they got people support, oh, that's awesome. You wrote a book. And I mean,

767
00:40:27.88 --> 00:40:32.12
why I'm like, kind of saw our grapes a little bit. I'm like, I'm a better writer than that person.

768
00:40:32.12 --> 00:40:35.48
Meanwhile, I didn't write anymore book. You know, I'm over here. Or you will want, yeah.

769
00:40:35.48 --> 00:40:45.40
Yeah, I wrote back in the day, long time ago, you know. But you know, I'm saying, I'm in that arena,

770
00:40:45.40 --> 00:40:48.60
you know, and I'm kind of in my mind hating on this. Well, they're seeing, there's people that hate

771
00:40:48.60 --> 00:40:53.08
on them that never even wrote a book in the first place. Yeah. And then I'm a better writer. I'm a better

772
00:40:53.08 --> 00:40:58.68
film guy. I'm a better writer. I'm a better writer. I'm a better writer. One effort. And all kinds of people

773
00:40:58.68 --> 00:41:04.76
doing that. All kinds of people that that will just be saying, I, you know, I, I, I was a better,

774
00:41:05.64 --> 00:41:13.08
whatever, fighter, GJ2 player, carpenter, whatever, you name it. Yeah. Meanwhile, taking no action,

775
00:41:14.60 --> 00:41:19.48
software engineer, I could have done that. Why didn't you? Yeah. You're that great. I'll say why,

776
00:41:19.48 --> 00:41:25.16
because you weren't committed. And the commitment that we're talking about is at night,

777
00:41:25.16 --> 00:41:30.12
yeah, night. That's what times are early early in the morning or in the middle of the day,

778
00:41:30.12 --> 00:41:37.16
whatever. You know, it, how you said like, you're, you're not doing these enormous shows of

779
00:41:37.16 --> 00:41:40.36
commitment, like either you're committed or you're not. And if you're committed, it's going to show

780
00:41:40.36 --> 00:41:45.64
itself like your action, you know, a lot of people again back to the guy who's like hating on

781
00:41:46.36 --> 00:41:51.000
his neighbor doing quote unquote mediocre work. Like, oh, that's John, that's not that good.

782
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.08
You know what it, you know what it, you know what, it's just maybe think of this. Sometimes you'd meet a guy

783
00:41:55.08 --> 00:42:03.56
that was say, I'm going to seal training. And, and they'd kind of be brag about it. And you could

784
00:42:03.56 --> 00:42:09.96
see in their eyes that that right there was good enough for them. Just tell you like, I'm going to

785
00:42:09.96 --> 00:42:14.76
seal, seal team training. Yeah. You know, no one calls us, he'll team training, but that's the kind of

786
00:42:14.76 --> 00:42:20.60
person because they just want to, and you, I, I, I, here guy, you know, guys saying that, yeah, I'm going to seal training.

787
00:42:21.72 --> 00:42:26.44
The guys that generally have a better chance are guys that, you know, you say, oh, what are you doing in the

788
00:42:26.44 --> 00:42:30.92
Navy? And they say, oh, you know, I'm, you know, just got done with a school and I'm starting,

789
00:42:31.96 --> 00:42:36.28
hoping to go to seal training. You know, they, they have to pry it out of them. Right. Yeah.

790
00:42:36.28 --> 00:42:41.32
That guy's a better chance. The guy that's already bragging, basically indirectly bragging,

791
00:42:41.32 --> 00:42:45.80
because he's implying that he's going to make it. Those guys, going to have a little bit more

792
00:42:45.80 --> 00:42:51.96
rough on now. This doesn't mean they're not, this doesn't mean don't be confident. But that's

793
00:42:51.96 --> 00:42:56.12
what I'm saying is some people that are like, I'm going for it. They're happy with just saying,

794
00:42:56.12 --> 00:43:00.36
I'm committed at quit my job and this is what I do. They're happy to let everyone know that.

795
00:43:01.56 --> 00:43:06.12
But what they're not happy to do is grind. That's what they're not happy to do. And that's where

796
00:43:06.12 --> 00:43:11.88
that's where you, that's where you make your money, right? Or where you make your goods or where you

797
00:43:11.88 --> 00:43:18.12
become successful? Yeah, there is, oh, what is it? It's, it's, it doesn't matter, but I'm

798
00:43:18.12 --> 00:43:25.48
listening to somebody and they were talking about like commit, like people have goals. I want to be a

799
00:43:26.36 --> 00:43:30.68
singer or whatever, want to be a CEO. That's money. I want to be a CEO.

800
00:43:30.68 --> 00:43:36.76
Oh, you can form up an LLC today and you can become the CEO. Exactly right. So that's kind of

801
00:43:36.76 --> 00:43:40.76
your problem. That's part of the point right there. It's like, okay, you want to be a CEO because

802
00:43:40.76 --> 00:43:46.28
you see all this cool stuff on wherever about being a CEO, but really what you're pursuing isn't

803
00:43:46.28 --> 00:43:51.64
necessarily being the, it is, but what you're pursuing, where you're going to end up and where you're

804
00:43:51.64 --> 00:43:57.56
going to find success as a CEO. If you're pursuing the day to day of being a CEO, it's like,

805
00:43:57.56 --> 00:44:03.72
oh, I said this before and it's, on the surface it's lame, but it's actually really accurate.

806
00:44:05.08 --> 00:44:10.44
Like, if you want to be a gangster, you have to do gangster stuff every day. It's not just like

807
00:44:10.44 --> 00:44:15.000
posing with your guns. It's like, you got to kind of, you got to put in that work kind of thing.

808
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000
You know, so if you're going to be, like, you can't just be Jocco and start a podcast and just

809
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.12
in, and, you know, put out a book and that's it and start collecting money. It's not like that.

810
00:44:26.12 --> 00:44:32.20
You got, you got to go through, you know, however old you are, there's other steps involved.

811
00:44:32.20 --> 00:44:36.76
Yes, exactly right. This day for that late for now, you used to joke about, you know, because

812
00:44:36.76 --> 00:44:42.20
when we started Ashalan front obviously, which is me and him, and we'd see some other guy

813
00:44:42.20 --> 00:44:49.000
out there and you'd be like CEO of something and we'd be saying, well, like as a CEO and you

814
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.16
look at their company and the company has them, but only one person or three people.

815
00:44:53.16 --> 00:45:00.36
Right. It brought you. That's the part of it. Yeah. On the CEO. I'm the CEO of Jocco podcast.

816
00:45:00.36 --> 00:45:04.20
Yeah. You know, it's just you and me. There's no CEO going on here. Yeah.

817
00:45:04.20 --> 00:45:12.36
Yeah. We're cruising too hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That deal. You got to focus on the right

818
00:45:12.36 --> 00:45:20.20
things as opposed to the wrong thing. Check. Next question. Jocco.

819
00:45:20.20 --> 00:45:26.52
I coach high school football, which I do with the star athlete who segregates himself and won't

820
00:45:26.52 --> 00:45:33.40
participate in hard drills or won't participate hard in drills. Yeah. Now this one I actually

821
00:45:33.40 --> 00:45:38.20
thankfully remembered that I said I would do this because when I got this, this is a Twitter question.

822
00:45:39.08 --> 00:45:44.36
And I responded to this Twitter question in one word. So, you know, he says, I got this guy

823
00:45:44.36 --> 00:45:49.64
star athlete who won't participate in drills. What should I do with him? I responded in one word. Bench.

824
00:45:50.84 --> 00:45:56.92
I thought that. So, so of course, you know, then people start saying, well, you know,

825
00:45:56.92 --> 00:46:02.20
and I was like, yeah, I know we're on Twitter, right? We're on Twitter. There's more to it.

826
00:46:02.20 --> 00:46:07.80
Then what's happening? I just answered 798 questions. I just was 799. So,

827
00:46:09.40 --> 00:46:12.60
not going to go into full detail. But then as people were kind of chiming, you know, it's like, okay,

828
00:46:12.60 --> 00:46:19.32
I'll all answer this on the podcast. So, we can go into it a little bit more. Because yes,

829
00:46:19.32 --> 00:46:24.44
your coach, your leader. And obviously, I talk about this all the time.

830
00:46:24.44 --> 00:46:33.16
Leadership is a nuanced thing. It takes balance. It takes maneuvering. It takes chess playing.

831
00:46:33.16 --> 00:46:38.04
It takes mental jiu-jitsu. It takes all those things, right? So, the obvious answer of just like Bench.

832
00:46:38.04 --> 00:46:46.60
That's my meat head answer. And fundamentally, we'll get to it. But, and fundamentally, that may be

833
00:46:46.60 --> 00:46:52.76
the result. But let's dive into it a little bit. Who's the kid? What's his deal? What's his background?

834
00:46:52.76 --> 00:46:59.32
What's his attitude? Where's he coming from? What's his family like life? What's his family life like?

835
00:47:00.04 --> 00:47:06.12
What is what's his past performance? What's his record? What year is he in school? I mean,

836
00:47:06.12 --> 00:47:11.16
there's all kinds of things we need to know. Right? So, now once we've sort of figured out what he

837
00:47:11.16 --> 00:47:16.68
like. Now that any one of those things, any one of those variables is going to change our course of

838
00:47:16.68 --> 00:47:21.96
action a little bit. Because being a leader doesn't mean you get to follow cookie cutter results or

839
00:47:21.96 --> 00:47:26.28
of cookie cutter solutions to things, right? You're dealing with human beings. And every single human

840
00:47:26.28 --> 00:47:30.52
being is different. And every single human being has a little craziness to them. That you cannot

841
00:47:30.52 --> 00:47:37.96
predict. So we're dealing with a kid. Guess what? A 16 year old boy? That kid is even more unpredictable.

842
00:47:37.96 --> 00:47:42.36
And even more crazy for him. Right? Because he's got testosterone flowing through his system. He's

843
00:47:42.36 --> 00:47:47.64
chasing girls. He's he's just going crazy. He's not secure with himself yet. He's got zits on his face.

844
00:47:47.64 --> 00:47:52.84
He's, you know, he's got things going on. He's got issues. Yeah. And so this kid's crazy. We're trying

845
00:47:52.84 --> 00:47:55.64
to deal with him. Now, most kids can get, you know, they get through that and they're still

846
00:47:55.64 --> 00:48:00.04
participating with the team. This kid's not. So, one of the first things I always say this. You

847
00:48:00.04 --> 00:48:03.72
got somebody that's not stepping up in the leadership position or they're not wanting to put him in charge

848
00:48:03.72 --> 00:48:09.72
of it. You know, you say, hey, echo. I want you to run this drill. I think the way I'm watching

849
00:48:09.72 --> 00:48:13.32
you perform on the field, I think you could really lead this drill. Well, I want you to lead this drill

850
00:48:13.32 --> 00:48:18.20
and show these guys what's up. Right? So you know what I mean? Yeah. I think you got a little

851
00:48:18.20 --> 00:48:22.84
fired up face on your lips. Just there. Yeah. So that might take his attitude. And now instead of

852
00:48:22.84 --> 00:48:27.72
me saying, hey, echo, you got to do this drill like everyone else. I already know that you don't

853
00:48:27.72 --> 00:48:32.36
want to do that. So I'm elevating you a little bit. Yeah. And you're ego a little push, a little massage

854
00:48:32.36 --> 00:48:36.44
and maybe you feel good about that now. And I say, hey, you know, you can run this drill faster

855
00:48:36.44 --> 00:48:39.24
than anyone else. I want you to lead it. I want you to show them how to do it. I want you to make

856
00:48:39.24 --> 00:48:47.000
our team better. Boom. Oh, so I'm going to get a little fired up. So that's that's one solution type.

857
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.56
Right? I'm just going to kind of a broad solution type. So another solution type is is, and this

858
00:48:51.56 --> 00:48:56.84
is really easy. Really easy is when you're talking to someone that you want to improve their

859
00:48:56.84 --> 00:49:04.60
performance, you don't go to them and say, hey, you need to get better. Because you're just right

860
00:49:04.60 --> 00:49:09.08
now, you're letting the whole team down. And you're just, you think you're so good. You think

861
00:49:09.08 --> 00:49:12.92
you're so good that you don't need to coach, you don't need to run drills with the team. You need to

862
00:49:12.92 --> 00:49:17.88
run drills with the team. Now you're out of to do what are you talking about. So instead of saying that,

863
00:49:19.24 --> 00:49:24.84
again, I'm going to ego you up a little bit and be say, hey, man, I'm going to talk to you. I

864
00:49:24.84 --> 00:49:30.52
gotta talk to you because I see so much potential with you with your game. I see your athletic

865
00:49:30.52 --> 00:49:36.52
ability. And I see the way that the other guys on the team look at you. You might not sense it. They

866
00:49:36.52 --> 00:49:41.72
look up to you. Your leader, whether you want to be a leader or not. And the potential that you

867
00:49:41.72 --> 00:49:50.36
have in his as an athlete is not going to come to fruition unless you at least get some of your

868
00:49:50.36 --> 00:49:56.12
potential as a leader in line. So the reason I want you to run these drills isn't to make you better.

869
00:49:56.12 --> 00:50:00.12
I already know you're good. I already know you're good at the drills. The reason I want you to run

870
00:50:00.12 --> 00:50:04.28
these drills, I want you to be even better. I want you to reach your potential. And by the way,

871
00:50:04.28 --> 00:50:07.48
you helping run these drills is going to make the team better. And the better the team does,

872
00:50:07.48 --> 00:50:13.96
the better you're going to do. The more scouts we're going to hear, look at you. So there's that.

873
00:50:13.96 --> 00:50:18.92
And obviously, I'm going to explain to him why the drills are important for him and for the team.

874
00:50:18.92 --> 00:50:22.84
And for a man that team together for the, everyone to reach the potential. So those were

875
00:50:24.28 --> 00:50:31.000
those are good too. And I guess overall, broadly, when I'd be doing this whole time,

876
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.72
is talking to the person, talking to the individual, trying to figure out what his reasons were

877
00:50:37.72 --> 00:50:44.28
for not when it participated in the drills. And then countering those reasons with logical answers.

878
00:50:44.28 --> 00:50:51.32
And you know, saying, Hey, here's why it's important in explaining it to him. And then eventually,

879
00:50:51.32 --> 00:50:55.88
you're going to get to a point where my coaching, my explaining, my maneuvering, my mental

880
00:50:55.88 --> 00:51:00.68
jiu-jitsu, none of its work. And he still telling me, I'm not running the drills. I don't need to.

881
00:51:01.40 --> 00:51:07.48
Cool. Bench. Next question. You know what I mean? Well, you play ball. What do you think?

882
00:51:07.48 --> 00:51:12.36
Yeah. I didn't play football. Yeah, no. That's exactly right. I would think, and I'm trying to

883
00:51:12.36 --> 00:51:19.000
put myself in the mindset back when I was in high school. I remember going into my senior year.

884
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.56
So you have, we had some kind of summer training. So it was really like high school summer training.

885
00:51:23.56 --> 00:51:29.72
Chinese. No, no, no, that was for fall. Okay. And I was like a camp situation, but no,

886
00:51:29.72 --> 00:51:34.52
summer training, which was like after spring and stuff. And what they call it, they call it technique

887
00:51:34.52 --> 00:51:40.52
sessions. And all it was was like, you know, I played a, uh, in high school was kind of like a slap

888
00:51:40.52 --> 00:51:46.92
back, which is a hybrid running back. Why do you see her type? And so the technique sessions were just

889
00:51:46.92 --> 00:51:51.96
kind of passing drills and, you know, just hand stuff. And maybe even some footwork. But it's

890
00:51:51.96 --> 00:51:55.64
it was kind of fun. It was just, you know, the quarterback was there and the receivers and the

891
00:51:55.64 --> 00:51:59.64
running back. And catch passes, run her out and stuff. And you know, for like, I don't know, 45 minutes

892
00:51:59.64 --> 00:52:05.80
hour. And so I remember going into my senior year and they're talking about, yeah, technique sessions

893
00:52:05.80 --> 00:52:09.72
this year, whatever, whatever. And I remember I was just talking to Jade, my brother. And I was like,

894
00:52:09.72 --> 00:52:13.48
yeah, technique sessions. Because it's a kind of where if you don't go, you don't get in big

895
00:52:13.48 --> 00:52:17.56
trouble or nothing. It's just strongly encouraged. You know, I'm kind of like, yeah, I'm not going to

896
00:52:17.56 --> 00:52:23.96
those kind of, because I was real. I, I had done well as a junior and I knew that now as a senior,

897
00:52:23.96 --> 00:52:27.80
I'm really going to do well or whatever, that's, that was my little thought, right? I don't need to go

898
00:52:27.80 --> 00:52:31.56
to those. So I was like, yeah, I'm not going into those with this kind of tone that like,

899
00:52:32.12 --> 00:52:37.24
that's for people who were trying to try and get better. Me, I'm already dope kind of thing, you know,

900
00:52:37.24 --> 00:52:43.24
and Jago's, he goes, oh, yeah, like super sarcastic, like almost offended. He's like, oh, yeah,

901
00:52:43.24 --> 00:52:48.28
because you don't need that, huh? And then he said, yeah, because you're just so much better than ever,

902
00:52:48.28 --> 00:52:53.40
and I think he said both of those. And I was like, you're right, I'll grow. It hit me really hard.

903
00:52:53.40 --> 00:53:00.12
I was like, dang, that's, he's right. Even if, even if, like, even if I really believe, which,

904
00:53:00.12 --> 00:53:05.80
it's dumb to believe that I won't benefit from that training, even if it's like, I'm just like,

905
00:53:05.80 --> 00:53:11.000
I'm better than you. My whole team, by the way, the team sport, we all work together to win this

906
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.52
stuff. You guys, I'm better than all you guys. Yeah, that's the, that's the feeling I hit me real hard.

907
00:53:16.52 --> 00:53:21.16
I was like, I didn't miss any of them. No, I'm not committed to it. So there was that.

908
00:53:22.52 --> 00:53:27.88
So in that, in that mindset, right, going in, because that's probably what it is. Yeah, it might be just that.

909
00:53:27.88 --> 00:53:31.64
And it makes sense. Like, we're in your mind if you don't get it brought to your attention. Like,

910
00:53:31.64 --> 00:53:35.000
that's really what it is. I don't need to do these drills. I'm scoring touchdowns every single game.

911
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.80
Why am I doing these drills that all these non-s touchdown scoring people are doing, you know?

912
00:53:40.68 --> 00:53:44.92
Just put me in one at a time to score touchdown, kind of an attitude, you know, that's probably what it is.

913
00:53:44.92 --> 00:53:50.68
Or making tackles or whatever the position is. I don't know. So just like how you said,

914
00:53:52.20 --> 00:53:57.48
make him kind of in charge of it. Kind of like, this guy, I don't know, this is Jim. I don't know.

915
00:53:57.48 --> 00:54:04.12
Jim, you know, take these guys and show them how it's done kind of thing in practice. Because it practices.

916
00:54:04.12 --> 00:54:07.72
Yeah, I imagine, imagine if you said, I'm not going to go this in the coach came up and he said,

917
00:54:07.72 --> 00:54:13.08
Hey, echo, you missed you practices. And you're like, yeah, you know, and he's like, hey, man,

918
00:54:13.48 --> 00:54:17.72
I need you to set the example and really show these guys how it's done and you're not showing up.

919
00:54:18.28 --> 00:54:26.92
Yeah. Even and me, me back in those days, if you would have left out the, like, you didn't show up

920
00:54:26.92 --> 00:54:30.84
part, leave that part out. That would have compelled me way more. Like, if you're like, you,

921
00:54:30.84 --> 00:54:35.000
man, you're over here as a junior, killing it. And now it's about to be your senior. You're

922
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.32
you, you should guys, how it's done. I'm like, oh, yeah, well, you know, because it's like feeding the

923
00:54:39.32 --> 00:54:43.40
thing. You're kind of thing. And boom, oh, yeah, big time she take charge in, um,

924
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.20
pop Warner football, which is, you know, younger guys in, I played for the color Rams.

925
00:54:50.20 --> 00:54:59.40
Yeah, it sounded ruthless. They are still out by the way. Um, and so my coach's name is Coach Skouval.

926
00:54:59.40 --> 00:55:03.88
And he had this kind of, it's kind of like a policy kind of the thing where when you do jumping

927
00:55:03.88 --> 00:55:08.92
jacks and you do, um, you know, drills like, um, they come grasp drills. This is just like,

928
00:55:08.92 --> 00:55:13.56
oh, you do this stuff. You roll, you do this things. And while you do this, in practice,

929
00:55:13.56 --> 00:55:18.28
and even before the game, when you're warming up, you yell as loud as you can. That's it. You yell,

930
00:55:18.28 --> 00:55:23.16
little kids just yelling, getting that spot for his reasons. And it worked, man, we were good. And,

931
00:55:24.44 --> 00:55:30.44
so what I would do is I would try to be the, like, yell as loud as I possibly can to be the loudest guy.

932
00:55:30.44 --> 00:55:35.40
During the entire, whatever you're doing, you're just yelling the entire time. The drills. Yeah,

933
00:55:35.40 --> 00:55:39.08
when it's your turn, not, not if you're standing, you know, stand up and line. Got it. And then the front

934
00:55:39.08 --> 00:55:44.76
three guys go. Yeah. So the coach stands in front of three guys, three lines. And the guys in the front

935
00:55:44.76 --> 00:55:49.48
are doing the drills. So he holds the ball and you go, ah, and you just basically shuffle your feet

936
00:55:49.48 --> 00:55:52.84
and he goes like that, then you turn, then you come back and he goes this way, turn, and then he goes

937
00:55:52.84 --> 00:55:57.08
down, then you basically sprawl. You know, boom, stand back up and ah, you know, and then you go,

938
00:55:57.08 --> 00:56:01.08
okay, like that. And then the three guys run now, it's the next guys. Got it. You're seeing the same.

939
00:56:01.08 --> 00:56:05.96
So, and when you're running, you got a yell too. So, that's when you're good,

940
00:56:05.96 --> 00:56:10.12
cardiovascular work. Yeah, to be yelling, because you can't breathe as much. What it does is

941
00:56:10.12 --> 00:56:14.84
gets you in the habit of just going hard, hard, every play. You know, and when you're done,

942
00:56:14.84 --> 00:56:18.44
you don't have to yell. You're cruising your esteem. Getting right. And when when it's go time,

943
00:56:18.44 --> 00:56:24.92
it's go time and habitually that's how it was, man. It really worked. And so anyway, when I would yell

944
00:56:24.92 --> 00:56:29.16
is that, and the coach would do this to a lot of kids. When you yell super loud, you know, you

945
00:56:29.16 --> 00:56:33.24
can just see here that guy yelling above everybody. He would give that guy attention. But look at

946
00:56:33.24 --> 00:56:37.96
this guy. He's getting a notch. Yeah, look at this. Look at this guy. And now the next guy,

947
00:56:37.96 --> 00:56:42.68
he's going to try to out yell that guy. Go harder, go harder. So, it's that same idea. You know,

948
00:56:42.68 --> 00:56:47.48
you give that guy props for working hard or showing everybody how it's done kind of thing. And it's

949
00:56:47.48 --> 00:56:51.48
like, man, he's going to keep that shit up. And everyone's going to want it. In fact, Jeff did me

950
00:56:51.48 --> 00:56:55.88
like that this week in training. So, I go in and just like, okay, after training, it's like,

951
00:56:55.88 --> 00:57:01.08
everybody, you know, Jeff's a good guy. Good. Very, yeah. He, you know, you do some pushups or what

952
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:05.000
he'll make you do some pushups or whatever. And he's like, okay, do the triangle drill. You know,

953
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.60
when you're on your back, you rock back, you do a triangle. You rock back again, go try to go the

954
00:57:08.60 --> 00:57:14.28
other side. So, all levels are in there. Begin as as well. And I'm doing it. And it goes, oh,

955
00:57:14.28 --> 00:57:19.56
everybody in the middle of you go, stop. Watch out. Echo does it. And I'm like, if I didn't see what

956
00:57:19.56 --> 00:57:25.16
was going on here, I would feel really empowered to just like show everyone how. And, you know,

957
00:57:25.16 --> 00:57:30.28
so he successfully pulled that off as far as the feeling in my head to a grown adult that knows

958
00:57:30.28 --> 00:57:35.64
because you were you doing them. Yeah, I was doing it with everybody. When he paused the whole

959
00:57:35.64 --> 00:57:39.56
class and said, watch how he does it. You know, so it's an exact same concept. You stepped up your game a

960
00:57:39.56 --> 00:57:44.84
little bit. Yeah, you don't take on like technique, show everybody. Yeah, no, it's good man. That

961
00:57:44.84 --> 00:57:49.16
works then. Like, and the point there is even if you know that that's what they're doing to you.

962
00:57:49.16 --> 00:57:55.000
It's still kind of works. Yeah. Hey, if you were the type of coach that had already had this

963
00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.68
happened before and like you just benched guy in the coach had the reputation that you don't play

964
00:58:00.68 --> 00:58:06.92
around. This would have happened in the first place. Really would it. I agree. I feel so. So you, you

965
00:58:06.92 --> 00:58:11.48
may have to set the example at some point. Yeah, the only drawback of that potentially is,

966
00:58:12.28 --> 00:58:16.84
you could, because in high school, a lot of the times like you can have one or two guys on the

967
00:58:16.84 --> 00:58:21.40
team, sometimes even one guy on the team that will dictate the outcome of the game. Where if this

968
00:58:21.40 --> 00:58:26.76
guy's playing, you'll probably win. If he's not, you'll probably lose and you have those dynamics

969
00:58:26.76 --> 00:58:32.92
in high school. So if you run that risk where, I mean, unless you, if you're looking at a bigger picture,

970
00:58:32.92 --> 00:58:38.76
like, well, I guess this is a bad example. If the guy, if you, if you as a coach, run things in a

971
00:58:38.76 --> 00:58:46.28
certain way, where you, where you don't allow any slack, yeah, then the probability of this occurring

972
00:58:46.28 --> 00:58:50.52
is going to be less. Yeah. It can be done for sure. Well, like, you know, it's a funny story.

973
00:58:50.52 --> 00:58:56.60
Lave tells sometimes is we were doing desert training in long story short. There's an opportunity

974
00:58:56.60 --> 00:59:02.28
to have guys take a break and go to town and have some beer and get a good meal before the

975
00:59:02.28 --> 00:59:09.64
field training exercises start. And that's normal. What everyone does. But we didn't do that.

976
00:59:09.64 --> 00:59:13.32
We didn't take a break, didn't go get food, didn't go get beers, nothing. We just got after

977
00:59:13.32 --> 00:59:18.04
more. And I didn't really think much of it. But Lave was like, yeah, of course we wanted to go

978
00:59:18.04 --> 00:59:21.64
but no one would know what I wanted to ask you. Yeah. Because it was just like, yeah, no slack. We're

979
00:59:21.64 --> 00:59:25.16
not, obviously, we're not, we're out here to train and get something, we're out here to, you know,

980
00:59:25.16 --> 00:59:31.48
go into town and drink a beer. No. And it's kind of funny looking back. But I think that that

981
00:59:31.48 --> 00:59:35.88
you can establish yourself as a type of leader that's just not going to allow, like, what

982
00:59:35.88 --> 00:59:39.88
do you talk about? You don't want to do the drills? Oh, but it starts with the little things. Like,

983
00:59:39.88 --> 00:59:45.08
who knows what this kid, you know, maybe he didn't want to put on his practice jersey. You

984
00:59:45.08 --> 00:59:48.84
want to wear this. You know what I mean? Just like little things, little things build up and eventually

985
00:59:48.84 --> 00:59:53.64
he's seen just like a normal kid, just like a five year old that pushes the envelope with everything.

986
00:59:53.64 --> 00:59:56.52
Oh, yeah. Oh, Mary, can't get away. Oh, what can I get away? Can't get away.

987
00:59:56.52 --> 00:59:59.56
Where that? What can I get away with? People like to push the envelope.

988
00:59:59.56 --> 01:00:07.16
Oh, my life. No slack. No. Yeah. But you can go too far with no slack. Of course. Yeah. And you now,

989
01:00:07.16 --> 01:00:11.96
everyone hates US code. Yeah. Because you just don't understand. You don't listen and you're a jerk.

990
01:00:11.96 --> 01:00:15.80
Yeah. You've, you've gone too far in one direction or you've gone too far in the other direction.

991
01:00:15.80 --> 01:00:19.64
Balance, like, out of my leadership. Get some. Yeah. That's true.

992
01:00:21.56 --> 01:00:26.36
Next question. Dockle, have you ever had a person you couldn't get through to?

993
01:00:27.08 --> 01:00:31.88
Some that you couldn't manipulate. Then what? What do you do when you can't get through?

994
01:00:31.88 --> 01:00:39.80
Well, yeah. Of course, I've had people that I could not get through to. And generally speaking,

995
01:00:39.80 --> 01:00:45.000
these people are like level 12 arrogance. That's what they are giant ego. That's what causes this.

996
01:00:45.72 --> 01:00:52.36
There was quite a few seal leaders that I dealt with. I shouldn't say quite a few. There was several

997
01:00:52.36 --> 01:00:57.48
seal leaders that I dealt with that. We're like that in a several business leaders that I've

998
01:00:58.12 --> 01:01:01.48
dealt with that. I would like that in podcast number five. I read that

999
01:01:01.48 --> 01:01:08.76
counseling letter, corrective measures to a guy that was really arrogant. And despite that letter,

1000
01:01:08.76 --> 01:01:15.24
he did not change and he got fired. So what do you do when you got someone that you can't get through

1001
01:01:15.24 --> 01:01:22.36
to? You, you fire them. That's, if they're, if, and here's what you've got to do is what makes

1002
01:01:22.36 --> 01:01:29.000
that tricky is that some people and this may, this, this, this, make people freak out.

1003
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.68
There's some people that there's such good performers that even though they're slightly negative

1004
01:01:35.32 --> 01:01:43.24
on maybe their team participation, but they're so good that that it offsets their negativity.

1005
01:01:43.24 --> 01:01:47.80
Right? And that happens. And happens. You know what happens with sales people? Sales people are

1006
01:01:47.80 --> 01:01:51.72
are in order to be in a sales position. You got to be confident. You got to be aggressive. You got to be

1007
01:01:51.72 --> 01:01:56.92
someone arrogant, right? You got to believe in yourself. And so some sales people take that to the

1008
01:01:56.92 --> 01:02:01.000
extreme where they're just like, I don't need to listen to what you're telling me the new procedures are.

1009
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.20
Yeah. Screw that. I'm the one that's doing the big dollars over here. How much I fall?

1010
01:02:04.20 --> 01:02:09.80
Am I procedures, boys? Right? So, so that happens. Yeah. Well, then what you got to do is you got to

1011
01:02:09.80 --> 01:02:13.72
look, does, does, is this guy producing so, now that can create problems within the team.

1012
01:02:14.44 --> 01:02:20.76
And you have to balance those things. Is this guy, is the negative idea is creating

1013
01:02:20.76 --> 01:02:26.84
offset by the awesome productivity that he's doing. And furthermore, if the guys that good,

1014
01:02:26.84 --> 01:02:31.24
hey, maybe we should be modeling some things after them. I know problem with that. If you're the best

1015
01:02:31.24 --> 01:02:36.84
performer, cool, I want to imitate you. I want to get my people to imitate you. So, that happens.

1016
01:02:36.84 --> 01:02:44.28
The other place where you might see it, a similar situation, is a leader that does really good

1017
01:02:44.28 --> 01:02:49.64
with their relationships down the chain of command. For instance, but really has bad relations up

1018
01:02:49.64 --> 01:02:54.68
the chain of command. So, again, you've got to ask yourself, okay, if I fire this leader,

1019
01:02:54.68 --> 01:02:57.40
how many of these people that he has great relationships are now going to leave and what kind of

1020
01:02:57.40 --> 01:03:03.48
detriment does that to the team? That can also happen with someone that doesn't that treats

1021
01:03:03.48 --> 01:03:09.24
their people like crap, but up the chain of command, everyone thinks he's great. And he's getting

1022
01:03:09.24 --> 01:03:15.56
the mission done, by the way. He's a slave driver and he's creating total animosity between

1023
01:03:15.56 --> 01:03:19.88
him and his team, but he's accomplishing the mission. So now what do you do? There's a risk. Everyone

1024
01:03:19.88 --> 01:03:24.20
could quit. There's a risk you could fire him and now you don't accomplish the mission anymore.

1025
01:03:24.20 --> 01:03:29.08
This is why leadership is hard and this is why you have to balance everything. You have to balance

1026
01:03:29.08 --> 01:03:34.36
those things. But, talked about it a bunch of times. If you get someone, you coach him, you mentor

1027
01:03:34.36 --> 01:03:38.52
him, you do everything you can, you flank him, you do your jits through mental jits and want them.

1028
01:03:38.52 --> 01:03:46.68
You try and get them squared away and eventually if you can't, you weigh against how it's going

1029
01:03:46.68 --> 01:03:51.48
to affect the situation and then in many cases you got to let him go. And we fired, you know, we fired

1030
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:59.88
five. So plenty of seals get fired from leadership positions. And same thing with, you know,

1031
01:03:59.88 --> 01:04:05.72
obviously we work with consulting businesses. We see all kinds of people getting fired because they're

1032
01:04:05.72 --> 01:04:11.24
either not capable of doing their job, they're too arrogant and they don't recognize the things

1033
01:04:11.24 --> 01:04:14.28
you're going sideways and they're just thinking that they're doing everything perfect. No, that's

1034
01:04:14.28 --> 01:04:25.40
not going to work out well for you. Yeah, what did I think is a life? He said, someone asked him,

1035
01:04:26.12 --> 01:04:29.80
you know, when do you know, when's that line where it's like when it's time to fire someone?

1036
01:04:29.80 --> 01:04:33.24
Yep. And he was like, you know, in that shell, there's a lot to it, but in a nutshell,

1037
01:04:33.24 --> 01:04:38.84
that was dope. He said, it's, you know you're at that point where you fire someone when

1038
01:04:39.88 --> 01:04:45.08
when you don't feel bad about it. Right. So it's like, yeah, you tried everything and

1039
01:04:45.40 --> 01:04:51.56
there's also people who are some validity to this that say the first time you think you should

1040
01:04:51.56 --> 01:04:57.24
fire someone you should fire them. That's the other end of the spectrum, right? And what that

1041
01:04:57.24 --> 01:05:00.92
means is when you're looking at someone and you're going, man, okay, I can save them, I can help

1042
01:05:00.92 --> 01:05:07.000
that. That's the kind of advice you give to someone. That's that's got a maternal instinct,

1043
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.96
right, that you need to say, hey, I know this guy's just a good guy and everyone on my team is great

1044
01:05:11.96 --> 01:05:17.80
and everyone's going to do great job. You can't tell that person what, Lafin, I normally tell people

1045
01:05:17.80 --> 01:05:22.04
which is when you feel good about it, you should fire him because that person will never feel

1046
01:05:22.04 --> 01:05:26.76
good about fire anybody just to. Okay, I do this guy, I know he's going to pick it. He's

1047
01:05:26.76 --> 01:05:31.80
always going to come around. You know, and then they start playing the extreme ownership game,

1048
01:05:31.80 --> 01:05:35.40
which is, you know, if I would have given Eko a better direction, he would have been able to do this.

1049
01:05:35.40 --> 01:05:42.12
It's my fault. I've had given Eko 17 iterations of this and he still didn't complete it correctly.

1050
01:05:42.12 --> 01:05:48.04
He's fired. That's the way it works, right? There's balance. So that spectrum of

1051
01:05:50.44 --> 01:05:55.88
being within the confines of being justified, firing somebody, a certain type of person, you

1052
01:05:55.88 --> 01:06:00.92
got to say when you don't feel bad about it. Right. Right. That's like a fire heavy type dood.

1053
01:06:00.92 --> 01:06:05.56
Right. But there's also someone. The reason you shouldn't feel bad about it is because I've done

1054
01:06:05.56 --> 01:06:13.08
everything I can do to help you, which takes work, it takes effort, it takes tact, it takes hard

1055
01:06:13.08 --> 01:06:17.48
conversations because it's hard for me to go and say, Eko, you know, I've been looking at your

1056
01:06:17.48 --> 01:06:22.76
videos lately and they're, they're not really what we're looking for. Right. I don't want to say that to you.

1057
01:06:22.76 --> 01:06:27.72
You know, I'm comfortable with kind of like, you know, we want to get along. So instead I'm like,

1058
01:06:27.72 --> 01:06:32.76
Eko, that video is good, man. Yeah, it's good. But I'm not telling you the truth. And then over time,

1059
01:06:32.76 --> 01:06:36.52
our videos are looking good enough and eventually I say, you know what, you know, we're no

1060
01:06:36.52 --> 01:06:41.56
one's buying our videos anymore and we haven't gotten any new contracts. So guess what,

1061
01:06:41.56 --> 01:06:45.16
I'm going to have to let you go. And you're like, what are we going to tell about? What are you talking about?

1062
01:06:45.16 --> 01:06:48.20
You said all the videos that made for good? Now you're firing me. Maybe you need to be become a

1063
01:06:48.20 --> 01:06:53.24
better salesperson. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas if I had the hard conversation early and said,

1064
01:06:53.24 --> 01:06:58.28
hey, Eko, you know, I know you're creative and I appreciate that. But we also need to get the message across

1065
01:06:58.28 --> 01:07:03.32
for our clients. I'm obviously fabricating a business where we're making videos videos for clients.

1066
01:07:03.32 --> 01:07:07.32
Yeah. Which I know we don't really do a lot of anymore. Occasionally you do it.

1067
01:07:07.32 --> 01:07:15.24
Oh, I can't do it. But yeah, you got to, you got to have the hard conversations earlier.

1068
01:07:15.24 --> 01:07:19.56
If I'm the type of person that doesn't like to have the hard conversations, once again,

1069
01:07:19.56 --> 01:07:25.16
I never feel good about it because I never, I never gave you an advice. So it always feels bad

1070
01:07:25.16 --> 01:07:32.52
for me to fire someone. Yeah. But if you're following good leadership tactics, then absolutely true.

1071
01:07:32.52 --> 01:07:35.32
When you get to a point where you got to fire somebody, you won't feel bad about it. Because you

1072
01:07:35.32 --> 01:07:39.80
know you've done everything you can. You know you've coach them, mentor them. And you know that

1073
01:07:39.80 --> 01:07:44.04
if you keep them on board, you are negatively impacting your team. Which is bad.

1074
01:07:44.04 --> 01:07:51.24
Yeah. And then go down to the other side of the spectrum. Still within the confines of being justified

1075
01:07:51.24 --> 01:07:54.68
in firing somebody by the way. But on the other side of the spectrum, you get how you say that

1076
01:07:54.68 --> 01:07:58.92
what you call the maternal instinct type. Maternal instinct. The person who can like, they're,

1077
01:07:58.92 --> 01:08:03.48
they're just super hard on themselves maybe or they're, you know, like, I, even if you did do

1078
01:08:03.48 --> 01:08:06.60
everything you can, you're still like, I could have done more. You know, so it's my fault not

1079
01:08:06.60 --> 01:08:11.32
it's I feel like I let them down as a leader. Yeah. You gave them 17 counseling chats. Yeah.

1080
01:08:11.32 --> 01:08:15.96
You know, they don't belong here. They can't do their job. Stop. Yeah. I mean, while they're going home

1081
01:08:15.96 --> 01:08:19.88
laughing at you or whatever. Yeah. You get that kind of person. So it's kind of like, how you say,

1082
01:08:19.88 --> 01:08:24.28
you got a balance. You got to be like, okay, you got to recognize, okay, what kind of person am I,

1083
01:08:24.28 --> 01:08:28.68
you know, or what kind of person is this other person kind of thing. And if they're those maternal

1084
01:08:28.68 --> 01:08:37.16
instinctual for lack of better way of putting a person, then what was it the first time you feel like you

1085
01:08:37.16 --> 01:08:41.56
should fire a mission fire. You hang out on that side of the spectrum. You got it. Yeah.

1086
01:08:44.28 --> 01:08:50.52
I switched. How do you regain respect from your employees after you've come across as

1087
01:08:50.52 --> 01:08:57.000
too nice? My husband and I are business owners with 45 employees in a small software

1088
01:08:57.80 --> 01:09:02.76
firm since adding more employees in the last 18 months, the culture is changing. I blame

1089
01:09:02.76 --> 01:09:09.32
our easy going attitude. Increasingly, there is an attitude problem where negative pushback has

1090
01:09:09.32 --> 01:09:18.44
become almost a daily occurrence. How do we lead our way out of this? Okay. Well, this is a rough one.

1091
01:09:20.36 --> 01:09:24.36
Not by no means I shouldn't have been said it's a rough one. It's a challenge, right? You have

1092
01:09:24.36 --> 01:09:29.56
to hit the reset button for sure. And you got to let people know that things are changing. Now,

1093
01:09:29.56 --> 01:09:39.000
I would straight up have a meeting that you you sit everyone down and say, hey, here's what's

1094
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:47.16
happening. We are growing and as we grow, we are going to have to evolve just like a person.

1095
01:09:47.16 --> 01:09:52.84
As you get older, you have to evolve. You have to become more mature. And here's some of the things

1096
01:09:52.84 --> 01:10:00.68
that we're going to have to tighten up. Right? Is instead of, you know, everyone's just, hey, if you

1097
01:10:00.68 --> 01:10:04.92
come in and you want to go, you got to, you know, it's your kids birthday. Oh, yeah, no problem,

1098
01:10:04.92 --> 01:10:10.60
they have. You say, look, that's not happening anymore. We will do our best to let you out for

1099
01:10:10.60 --> 01:10:17.40
your daughter's birthday. We will do our best to let you go take care of family members when they're

1100
01:10:17.40 --> 01:10:25.24
sick. We will do our best to give you bonuses that you've become accustomed to. We will do our best

1101
01:10:25.24 --> 01:10:31.88
to give you raises annually. We will do our best to continue to take care of you, but none of those

1102
01:10:31.88 --> 01:10:43.16
things are guaranteed at all. We are trying to be profitable. In fact, we have to be profitable

1103
01:10:43.16 --> 01:10:49.16
in order to continue as a business. On top of being profitable, in order to grow, we have to

1104
01:10:49.16 --> 01:10:54.36
reinvest in the company. We have to take the money that we make and we have to put it back into this

1105
01:10:54.36 --> 01:11:02.36
company in order to grow. And we are going to grow that is our goal. In order to grow, we are going

1106
01:11:02.36 --> 01:11:11.40
to have to put procedures and standards in place. Now that will allow us to maintain some control

1107
01:11:11.40 --> 01:11:18.84
and efficiency as we grow. If we don't do that, we're going to fall apart. So that is what we need

1108
01:11:18.84 --> 01:11:24.44
to do. Now, why do we want to grow? The reason we want to grow is because we want to be bigger.

1109
01:11:24.44 --> 01:11:29.16
We want to create more opportunity for everyone sitting in this room. We're not trying to grow

1110
01:11:29.16 --> 01:11:34.12
for us. We're trying to grow for everyone. The more opportunity everyone has to advance and

1111
01:11:34.12 --> 01:11:42.36
leadership to make more money, that is what we are trying to do. But we can only do that if we

1112
01:11:42.36 --> 01:11:48.36
as we grow, we evolve and become better and become more efficient and become more standardized

1113
01:11:48.36 --> 01:11:56.36
in the next 18 to 24 months. That is what we have to do as a company. So I would have a meeting

1114
01:11:56.36 --> 01:12:00.92
and say something like that. Something along those lines laid down the wall a little bit. Now,

1115
01:12:00.92 --> 01:12:07.80
also then you have to change your attitude. You have to somewhat change your attitude. Because

1116
01:12:07.80 --> 01:12:12.12
you are Mr. Nice guy. That's how you ended up in this position. You know, the husband and wife team

1117
01:12:12.12 --> 01:12:20.04
Mr. Mr. and Mrs. Nice guy. And you can and should be nice as a leader. I understand that.

1118
01:12:20.04 --> 01:12:26.52
But at this point, the team needs to get tightened up. And so you're going to have to impose some

1119
01:12:26.52 --> 01:12:34.44
discipline on them in order for there to be freedom in the future. Surprisingly, but we know that.

1120
01:12:34.44 --> 01:12:42.84
Now, I had a friend who was a platoon commander. And he was he worked with me and I knew him.

1121
01:12:42.84 --> 01:12:49.08
And when he was a platoon commander, he was a real nice guy. Super nice guy. When he was a platoon commander,

1122
01:12:49.64 --> 01:12:55.40
he was a nice guy. Super nice guy. Things didn't work out good for him. Because I don't know

1123
01:12:55.40 --> 01:12:59.72
that I don't specifically know what happened. But I know that things didn't go great.

1124
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.48
And when he talked to me about it, because the thing is when I work with him, we were all

1125
01:13:05.48 --> 01:13:10.36
bros. And I was a young and lister guy. But we know we were all bros. But we all had that level of respect.

1126
01:13:10.36 --> 01:13:13.80
Hey, you know what? We can go out and have a beer tonight. But tomorrow morning, we get to work.

1127
01:13:14.36 --> 01:13:20.20
I'm in the game. And I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm telling the line. And that's pretty much what

1128
01:13:20.20 --> 01:13:26.92
we were all like. All of us and Mr. Guys working with this guy. And when he got to this new place,

1129
01:13:26.92 --> 01:13:31.32
new command, all of a sudden, it wasn't like that anymore. And he was growing out with people.

1130
01:13:31.32 --> 01:13:35.64
And when he get back into work, they, they wanted to grow out at work. And it was like, well,

1131
01:13:35.64 --> 01:13:39.96
we don't need to listen to you. We were at beers of the last night. And that's what he told me. He said,

1132
01:13:39.96 --> 01:13:49.72
you know, I, I was too nice of a guy. And I didn't get the respect that I needed to be able to

1133
01:13:49.72 --> 01:13:57.64
effectively run the platoon. And it was not good. And he said something to me too, which I,

1134
01:13:57.64 --> 01:14:02.04
I guess I instinctively knew or maybe I didn't, but it stuck with me. You know, it's real easy

1135
01:14:03.56 --> 01:14:09.000
to give more slack to someone when you have them on a tight leash. Right? It's real easy.

1136
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.44
Yeah. Yeah. It's hard to do the other thing. It's hard to, well, listen to this. When I have

1137
01:14:14.44 --> 01:14:18.12
you on a tight leash, and I give you a little slack, you're happy. You're like, oh, look at

1138
01:14:18.12 --> 01:14:21.88
Jokko, he, he trusts me. He's let me go a little bit. When I give you all kinds of,

1139
01:14:22.68 --> 01:14:26.36
all kinds of slack, and all of a sudden I have to tighten up. I start pulling on the leash. We're

1140
01:14:26.36 --> 01:14:30.44
guess what? It chokes your neck. It chokes you. And I start bringing them. And the further I got to pull

1141
01:14:30.44 --> 01:14:35.48
you back on, in, the longer you're choking for. And so by the time you get back to me, you're

1142
01:14:35.48 --> 01:14:43.16
ready to bite. And so that's what you have to do. You don't walk in and put the dogs out and let them run

1143
01:14:43.16 --> 01:14:48.28
wild to the end of the leash and let them run whatever they want. And then try and pull them back in.

1144
01:14:48.28 --> 01:14:51.88
Because when you let them go, by the way, you're thinking yourself, well, you know, this is a good dog.

1145
01:14:51.88 --> 01:14:55.08
So when I let them run around, he's not going to do anything wrong. He's going to be a perfect

1146
01:14:55.08 --> 01:14:59.000
same. When there's a chance that's going to happen. And there's a chance that's a good dog and

1147
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.12
you let them run around. And when you say come back, he comes back to you. There's also a chance that

1148
01:15:02.12 --> 01:15:07.16
he's not a good dog. And when he gets out there, he starts running and start biting people or running

1149
01:15:07.16 --> 01:15:12.52
and then road or doing whatever that dog's do. And so what do you know if you do that dog,

1150
01:15:12.52 --> 01:15:17.24
because you got to pull them back to you? And it's actually worse because we already know this is a

1151
01:15:17.24 --> 01:15:23.000
bad dog. So when you pull them back, he's pissed and he's going to bite you. Whereas a good dog

1152
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.56
wasn't doing anything bad in the first place. And when you pull them back, any looks that you

1153
01:15:25.56 --> 01:15:30.28
can go, hey, I must have gone too out of control. I'm sorry. I'm back in line now. You see what I'm

1154
01:15:30.28 --> 01:15:38.04
saying? There's a the way the whole thing unfolds is bad because the bad dog, he's a bad dog.

1155
01:15:38.04 --> 01:15:41.32
And he's doing bad stuff when you give him slack on the leash. And when you pull them back, he's going to

1156
01:15:41.32 --> 01:15:46.36
snap at you. The good dog, you give him all kinds of room on leash. He's not doing anything good. And when

1157
01:15:46.36 --> 01:15:52.52
you pull them back, he goes, oh, sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something out of line. Master.

1158
01:15:53.64 --> 01:15:57.72
I'll keep it in check now. And you can give me more slack if you want or not, doesn't matter.

1159
01:15:57.72 --> 01:16:02.60
I want to, I want you to trust me. Meanwhile, the bad dog, he's just like growling. He's pissed.

1160
01:16:04.04 --> 01:16:08.52
So that's going to be a hard one. Not like I said, it's not impossible. But the big thing you

1161
01:16:08.52 --> 01:16:14.84
got to do, I think in this situation, you got to be clear. Here's what's going on. You could even

1162
01:16:14.84 --> 01:16:19.32
potentially, I don't know how well you are of a speaker interacting with people. You could even say

1163
01:16:19.32 --> 01:16:23.64
something along the lines of, you know, hey, look, we've been running this real loose.

1164
01:16:24.60 --> 01:16:29.80
And I've been real, you know, we've been doing everything we could to run this as loose as possible.

1165
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.08
But we got to tighten it up. I think that's, I think you could say that because you don't want to say,

1166
01:16:35.08 --> 01:16:39.56
look, I've been being nice and I can't be nice anymore. That comes across wrong. But let's say,

1167
01:16:39.56 --> 01:16:44.12
look, we've been running it real loose here. And we've been trying to give you guys as much freedom as we can.

1168
01:16:44.12 --> 01:16:47.48
And we still want you guys to have freedom. But we got to put some parameters in place that are

1169
01:16:47.48 --> 01:16:53.48
going to, that are going to allow us to run this business efficiently as we grow and as we scale.

1170
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.52
You can quote me on that one by the way.

1171
01:16:56.52 --> 01:17:05.000
Yeah, make sense when you say, be clear and consistent. You know, like,

1172
01:17:06.04 --> 01:17:10.92
some people, they'll implement rules and I'm speaking from an employee standpoint where I'm looking

1173
01:17:10.92 --> 01:17:14.60
at the boss when they're trying to play new rules to tighten it up. So to speak, because then the

1174
01:17:14.60 --> 01:17:20.04
night club industry that tends to happen, you know, managers are growing out with, I like to turn

1175
01:17:20.04 --> 01:17:30.52
and grow out by the way. Do you never heard that? Have you never heard that? I don't think so. Not that I can't remember. But it's interesting. I thought that was pretty common vernacular, especially amongst a bro like yourself.

1176
01:17:32.52 --> 01:17:40.60
Bro, bro and I, the, um, yeah, and the night club managers tend to grow out with people or, you know,

1177
01:17:40.60 --> 01:17:45.32
grow out with girls or whatever the wages, whatever, whatever. I don't know if you can grow out with girls. Yeah,

1178
01:17:45.32 --> 01:17:49.24
I don't know if that's a kind of talk. So it's a really, really, really different word for it. Yeah,

1179
01:17:49.24 --> 01:17:53.80
we're, group awards, whatever, um, but nonetheless, that tends to happen. So, you know, some sense,

1180
01:17:54.36 --> 01:18:00.44
same situation, you know, you get night club industry disarray as a business, you know,

1181
01:18:00.44 --> 01:18:05.32
thin they got to tighten it up and apply more rules and now you got to, you know, whatever with the

1182
01:18:05.32 --> 01:18:11.32
clock ins, it's like just little rules that. Yeah. And I do negative attitude. Now all these rules,

1183
01:18:11.32 --> 01:18:16.28
the damn rules, yeah, I'm a late person. They're the whole clock in thing. It's anyway,

1184
01:18:16.28 --> 01:18:24.76
you long story, but, um, so I'm going to get a tie. Echoes. So, one, the manager would implement the

1185
01:18:24.76 --> 01:18:30.76
rules, but they don't follow the rules, you know, it's, man, they just won't take. And people

1186
01:18:30.76 --> 01:18:37.16
get more mad, but when you see there is his, and he died to, unfortunately, Joel, he was, um,

1187
01:18:37.16 --> 01:18:43.000
he was, he was our boss for, for a while. And he, uh, he had to kind of do that, like implement the rules.

1188
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.44
But this was, uh, he would grow out with you, but like, it was weird. He did this weird kind of balance

1189
01:18:48.44 --> 01:18:54.60
where he would break some rules, but then he'd follow rules, but the rules that he broke, he wouldn't

1190
01:18:54.60 --> 01:18:58.76
care if you broke them. Kind of thing. These are all small teeny tiny rules, by the way. Um,

1191
01:18:58.76 --> 01:19:03.56
but he was a real consistent person, you know, where if you wanted something done, we were all doing it,

1192
01:19:03.56 --> 01:19:08.76
including him, you know, and I remember thinking, man, this, I really like this guy in that way as well,

1193
01:19:08.76 --> 01:19:12.36
where he's telling us to do stuff, but he won't, like, because there's other managers,

1194
01:19:12.36 --> 01:19:16.76
all man, I can go into it, man, where there's other managers and they were straight up, like,

1195
01:19:16.76 --> 01:19:22.12
I'm the manager here. It's just, you know, it's just, you know, it's a weird dynamic in nightclubs.

1196
01:19:22.12 --> 01:19:26.44
Anyway, and they wouldn't follow the rules at all, you know, but you had to, because you're the

1197
01:19:26.44 --> 01:19:30.52
employee, you know, kind of thing. But yeah, when you're a manager, and again, from,

1198
01:19:30.52 --> 01:19:38.52
employee standpoint, and I see my boss following the new rules, consistently, it's so much easier to

1199
01:19:38.52 --> 01:19:42.28
sign on. It's kind of like, okay, that's what we're doing. I dig it. And yeah, if you combine it with

1200
01:19:42.28 --> 01:19:47.24
like what you said being clear, oh, I'm down. I'm down for the change. I get it, man. I get it.

1201
01:19:48.28 --> 01:19:49.64
Yeah, next question.

1202
01:19:52.20 --> 01:19:57.80
Joko, no bad teams, only bad leaders, and always the same relationship with each boss.

1203
01:19:57.80 --> 01:20:07.16
Yes, you also staged a mutiny. How do you reconcile that? Okay, so what are you talking about? Obviously,

1204
01:20:07.16 --> 01:20:12.36
no bad teams, no bad leaders is from extreme ownership. And it's actually from before that,

1205
01:20:12.36 --> 01:20:17.56
Napoleon said the same thing. Hackworth said the same thing. We changed the words a little bit.

1206
01:20:19.56 --> 01:20:23.08
So that's, and then the other thing you talked about is that I always say I have the same relationship

1207
01:20:23.08 --> 01:20:27.08
with every boss. I've ever had whether they were stupid or smart or whether they were aggressive or

1208
01:20:27.08 --> 01:20:31.48
passive, whether they were big ego or humble. I always had the same relationship with all of them.

1209
01:20:31.48 --> 01:20:36.20
That is, they trust me and they gave me what I need to do to do my job. So

1210
01:20:37.88 --> 01:20:43.000
how do I reconcile? Then then he started about the stage to mutiny because we had a kind of a mutiny

1211
01:20:43.24 --> 01:20:51.96
in one of my platoons, parking a turn when I was a young and listed guy. And so how can you do that,

1212
01:20:51.96 --> 01:20:55.88
right? If I had all these great relationships with all my bosses, and but what about I stage

1213
01:20:55.88 --> 01:20:59.88
immunity? Interesting. I actually had a decent relationship with the guy that I staged.

1214
01:20:59.88 --> 01:21:04.60
I'm mutiny with now that I think about it. So to go back to the earlier question,

1215
01:21:04.60 --> 01:21:09.32
well, I'll talk about being a renegade and you know, being a rebel. And like I said,

1216
01:21:09.32 --> 01:21:15.24
you have to rebel when it is necessary. So, and also for the mutiny that is in question,

1217
01:21:15.88 --> 01:21:22.04
I need to make it clear here. I didn't stage the mutiny. It wasn't me. It was kind of a group effort

1218
01:21:22.04 --> 01:21:27.88
that was somewhat led by the leadership of the enlisted leadership of our platoon. And it was a

1219
01:21:27.88 --> 01:21:33.64
movement that I certainly supported and was on board with. And we were kind of the E5 Mafia in that platoon.

1220
01:21:33.64 --> 01:21:40.76
Yeah. So we were kind of had the voice of the people, right? Me and a certain group of guys,

1221
01:21:40.76 --> 01:21:47.56
actually from my Buds class, who were all kind of, yeah, kind of just fired up about things.

1222
01:21:47.56 --> 01:21:56.36
And you know, I, it wasn't, the thing is it wasn't like the platoon commander had a couple

1223
01:21:56.36 --> 01:22:01.16
weaknesses, right? And maybe he wasn't the best at tactics or maybe it wasn't that, you know,

1224
01:22:01.16 --> 01:22:04.84
he wasn't the best shot or anything like wasn't the best athlete. No, he was a good athlete.

1225
01:22:04.84 --> 01:22:13.56
He tactically, he was like marginal. But what he didn't have, talk about the salt time,

1226
01:22:13.56 --> 01:22:18.44
what do you never even have any humility at all? And so he wasn't listening to anyone that was

1227
01:22:18.44 --> 01:22:26.04
giving him any input, including he had very experienced senior enlisted advisors. So the platoon

1228
01:22:26.04 --> 01:22:33.80
chief and the platoon alpio were awesome guys, very respected seals. One of them had been in the first

1229
01:22:33.80 --> 01:22:39.000
Gulf War on the ground getting after it as much as he could. So these guys were experienced

1230
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.88
and the senior chief was a really, really smart guy. And this guy wasn't listening to.

1231
01:22:47.80 --> 01:22:52.20
And so you had somebody that in the situation was, it would have been bad for the platoon

1232
01:22:53.56 --> 01:22:58.52
to have this type of leader in there. And now think about this, if it's bad for the platoon,

1233
01:22:58.52 --> 01:23:05.80
that it's bad for your mission. If you don't have a good platoon, you can't execute your mission well.

1234
01:23:05.80 --> 01:23:14.20
And that's the bottom line to this question, that is how I reconcile this. How does this situation

1235
01:23:14.20 --> 01:23:19.32
affect the mission? Effect our ability to accomplish the mission? How does it do it?

1236
01:23:20.76 --> 01:23:25.88
If we have a bad leader and it makes us a bad platoon, then we're not going to be able to accomplish

1237
01:23:25.88 --> 01:23:31.72
our mission. And therefore, I need to help get rid of this person because my number one thing that I'm

1238
01:23:31.72 --> 01:23:41.88
trying to do is be good at my mission. And obviously a more unified team is going to accomplish

1239
01:23:41.88 --> 01:23:51.40
the mission more effectively and more efficiently period. So that is why it is so important for

1240
01:23:51.40 --> 01:23:57.96
people to understand the mission and the goal and the commanders intent because all of your decisions

1241
01:23:57.96 --> 01:24:05.32
are based on and guided by that understanding of understanding what the mission is.

1242
01:24:08.12 --> 01:24:14.04
And so you need to put the mission first all the time to make the right decision. Now as

1243
01:24:14.04 --> 01:24:19.16
soon as I say that, what pops in your head? Oh, Jocco, you care about the mission more than you care

1244
01:24:19.16 --> 01:24:27.24
about your men. Not true. Because think about this. If you are executing your mission effectively,

1245
01:24:27.96 --> 01:24:33.96
you are taking care of your men. That's in the business world and it's in the battlefield.

1246
01:24:34.76 --> 01:24:39.72
Because in the business world, if I'm executing my mission effectively, guess what we're doing.

1247
01:24:39.72 --> 01:24:44.28
We're making more money. We're being more profitable. We're gaining more clients. We're growing.

1248
01:24:44.28 --> 01:24:48.36
And therefore, I'm taking care of my employees because I'm keeping them employed and making

1249
01:24:48.36 --> 01:24:51.88
them more bonuses and making them more money and offering them more leadership opportunities.

1250
01:24:53.24 --> 01:25:00.44
In combat, same thing. If we are good and I execute my mission effectively, guess what?

1251
01:25:00.44 --> 01:25:09.72
We've mitigated risk in the best possible way. The more we mitigate risk, the more people are

1252
01:25:09.72 --> 01:25:19.88
alive, the less casualties we take. So if I'm doing everything geared towards the mission, then I am

1253
01:25:19.88 --> 01:25:24.84
taking care of my men because by the way, if I'm running a mission with heavy casualties,

1254
01:25:24.84 --> 01:25:31.40
what about my next mission? If you're my boss and you tell me to charge this machine gun

1255
01:25:31.40 --> 01:25:38.04
nest with my guys and I say, boss, we shouldn't do that right now. You carry out the mission.

1256
01:25:38.04 --> 01:25:44.44
Okay, who's going to do the next mission? Right? There's not unlimited guys here. So you can't do it.

1257
01:25:44.44 --> 01:25:50.60
You can't run a mission after you've taken heavy casualties just like you can't if you as a business

1258
01:25:50.60 --> 01:25:58.12
person, if you expend all of your capital on one project, well, guess what? You can't do the next project.

1259
01:25:58.12 --> 01:26:03.32
So good job. You accomplish the one mission, but you can't accomplish any more on the battlefield.

1260
01:26:03.32 --> 01:26:08.76
If you incur a bunch of casualties for one mission, you can't accomplish any more. So in both

1261
01:26:08.76 --> 01:26:14.84
those cases, the more effectively you handle the mission, not just the one mission, but your broad

1262
01:26:14.84 --> 01:26:19.80
mission, your strategic mission, the better you do that, the better you are taking care of your men,

1263
01:26:20.84 --> 01:26:24.84
and the better you're taking care of your people in the business world. So

1264
01:26:24.84 --> 01:26:37.16
and on top of that, on top of that, 99% of the time, your mission is aligned with the best thing

1265
01:26:37.16 --> 01:26:41.48
for your people. That's what I'm saying. 99% of the time, if we make more money as a company,

1266
01:26:41.48 --> 01:26:47.72
it helps all my people. If we accomplish missions in the most effective and efficient and take the

1267
01:26:47.72 --> 01:26:56.92
least casualties, that's the best thing for my people. So back to the question, how do I reconcile

1268
01:26:56.92 --> 01:27:02.36
these things? I look at how I can best accomplish the mission. And if it best accomplish the mission

1269
01:27:02.36 --> 01:27:06.44
to rebel against what's happening, there's some cases where I might, you might be my boss,

1270
01:27:06.44 --> 01:27:10.52
and I might not like you, but you've got a great relationship with the army commander and we're

1271
01:27:10.52 --> 01:27:16.44
working in their battle space. Would it make sense for me to throw a mutiny and get you fired?

1272
01:27:16.44 --> 01:27:22.76
No, it'd make no sense whatsoever. It's going to be better for our mission if I say echo sucks,

1273
01:27:22.76 --> 01:27:25.56
but I'm going to listen to him and we're going to massage this thing or we're going to make things

1274
01:27:25.56 --> 01:27:29.72
work because he has such a good relationship with the Army commander that he's making things happen.

1275
01:27:31.40 --> 01:27:38.04
So I might not do it. I might not stay to mute, not based on the fact that you, that you're

1276
01:27:38.04 --> 01:27:43.24
level of sucking, but based on the fact that what's more important to me is that we accomplish

1277
01:27:43.24 --> 01:27:46.44
our mission. And if you have a good relationship with the Army commander, I'm going to keep you around.

1278
01:27:48.12 --> 01:27:55.32
If you were in a business situation and you had you were not doing a good job and you're

1279
01:27:55.32 --> 01:28:00.04
one of my subordinates, you're not doing a good job, but you have this great relationships with all these

1280
01:28:00.04 --> 01:28:05.56
clients. And we're accomplishing our mission well because you've built these great relationships.

1281
01:28:05.56 --> 01:28:08.84
I'm just going to fire you because I think you're doing a fix. I think you're a crappy leader

1282
01:28:08.84 --> 01:28:14.36
of your men. No, actually, I'm not. What is best for the mission? Now I might have

1283
01:28:14.36 --> 01:28:18.76
third secondary and tertiary plans to move you into position where you don't have to handle

1284
01:28:18.76 --> 01:28:22.44
the operational things that you suck at. And I might put you in a position where you're just going

1285
01:28:22.44 --> 01:28:26.84
to become a business dev, a biz dev guy where you're out there meeting and greeting people because

1286
01:28:26.84 --> 01:28:31.88
that's what you're good at. I might make that happen. But I'm not just going to go echo is a bad

1287
01:28:31.88 --> 01:28:37.72
leader, fire him throw away the skill that you do have. And now we're not accomplishing our mission

1288
01:28:37.72 --> 01:28:41.96
because I ruined all the relationships because now you go to all these other partners that we

1289
01:28:41.96 --> 01:28:45.96
have and you're going to yeah, jockel fired me. He's pathetic. He doesn't realize what we're doing

1290
01:28:45.96 --> 01:28:49.96
here. I'm going over to this company. Come with me. Bring your business over here with me.

1291
01:28:51.56 --> 01:28:56.92
So you reconcile it by looking at the mission and the mission is almost always aligned with taking

1292
01:28:56.92 --> 01:29:00.52
care your people and taking care of your people in the sense of

1293
01:29:00.52 --> 01:29:08.36
imposing discipline or not imposing discipline. It is being disciplined and making them work

1294
01:29:08.36 --> 01:29:14.52
and giving them training them hard pushing them. That is generally what taking care of people is.

1295
01:29:14.52 --> 01:29:20.28
Taking care of people isn't hey, you know what echo. Oh, you know, don't worry about that video

1296
01:29:20.28 --> 01:29:23.88
that you're out of the client. I know you. I know what your daughter's birthday. You go ahead and go home

1297
01:29:23.88 --> 01:29:28.76
for the day. Am I taking care of you? If I do that, then I'm not taking care of you. No, I'm not.

1298
01:29:28.76 --> 01:29:33.80
I'm actually hurting you because now we got a bad reputation. We delivered the video late.

1299
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.28
The company passes word to the next company. It says hey, you know, let's guys the video is okay,

1300
01:29:40.28 --> 01:29:45.56
but it doesn't matter because it was late. Now that's the reputation we have. Now fast forward six

1301
01:29:45.56 --> 01:29:49.32
months. We're downsizing. I don't need you anymore. I'm going to make the, I'm, you know,

1302
01:29:49.32 --> 01:29:54.12
I don't need four video makers. I only need one and you're not the one. You see what I'm saying?

1303
01:29:54.12 --> 01:30:00.92
So I'm not taking care of my people. If I focus on the mission, which is hey echo, I apologize.

1304
01:30:00.92 --> 01:30:04.76
I know what your daughter's birthday, but guess what? We owe this video. We got to get it done.

1305
01:30:05.48 --> 01:30:09.88
And you got to get in here and make it happen. Am I taking care of you then? Yes, I am. I know.

1306
01:30:09.88 --> 01:30:16.12
It doesn't feel that way. But yes, I am. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1307
01:30:18.44 --> 01:30:21.96
Making sure they're equipped capable and

1308
01:30:21.96 --> 01:30:32.76
treated fairly. Yeah. Yeah. I said imposed discipline on them. Yeah. And like that doesn't work. Yeah.

1309
01:30:35.88 --> 01:30:39.88
But what you have to do is you have to impose this point. Yeah, make sure there's this

1310
01:30:39.88 --> 01:30:44.52
copy. There's this copy. There's this copy. Yeah. Because you don't want to say echo, you will

1311
01:30:44.52 --> 01:30:48.92
come in and make this video. I'm imposing this on your back echo. We all this video. We said we're

1312
01:30:48.92 --> 01:30:52.84
going to turn it in. Let me tell you the ramifications if we don't do this. Here's what's going to hurt.

1313
01:30:53.64 --> 01:30:56.28
It's going to hurt this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this. It's going to eventually

1314
01:30:56.28 --> 01:31:00.84
could end up with you not having a job and me not having a business. Yeah. Do you like the sounds of that?

1315
01:31:00.84 --> 01:31:07.24
No, you don't. No. You might be the wrong guy to ask about this. Maybe you're not, I don't know.

1316
01:31:07.24 --> 01:31:13.56
But what do you think? So you mentioned missing your daughter's birthday. I didn't miss my daughter's

1317
01:31:13.56 --> 01:31:19.48
birthday, by the way. Do you say you did or did not? Did not. But my son just had a first birthday.

1318
01:31:19.48 --> 01:31:24.36
I did miss that. But it's his first birthday. So I've always thought this is before I had any kids with

1319
01:31:24.36 --> 01:31:30.12
any birthdays that the first birthday that's for the parents. Some for the, you know, he doesn't

1320
01:31:30.12 --> 01:31:34.44
remember the first his first birthday. Never will. I'm definitely going to be the wrong person.

1321
01:31:34.44 --> 01:31:45.40
So missing birthdays is that like a bell curve like okay one first birthday, age one,

1322
01:31:45.40 --> 01:31:50.84
you can sort of miss that age zero. You can't really miss that. Meaning one, they're born.

1323
01:31:50.84 --> 01:31:56.60
Go go go talk to the military people. I know, I know. Yeah. No, you're right. And I'm saying

1324
01:31:56.60 --> 01:32:00.84
if you have the options and you know, we're speaking in terms of okay, if you're lost, that's

1325
01:32:00.84 --> 01:32:06.52
sure. I mean, you sort of have like in terms of, you know, we're at this company, you're my boss

1326
01:32:06.52 --> 01:32:11.16
on the video maker. Hey, echo, you know, we've got to get this video done. Whatever. I don't know. That may be

1327
01:32:11.16 --> 01:32:19.000
even in an extreme case. I'm saying in a general sense, which birthdays are more expendable. That's

1328
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.88
ultimately the question. And it doesn't necessarily mean in this. Yeah. I'm going to tell you right now

1329
01:32:23.88 --> 01:32:28.20
as a guy that was in the military for 20 years. The birthday, if you're there, it's a luxury.

1330
01:32:28.20 --> 01:32:31.88
If you're there for Christmas, it's a luxury. If you're there for Thanksgiving, it's a luxury.

1331
01:32:31.88 --> 01:32:37.48
I missed all kinds of that stuff all over the place. Just like a big joke. You big, you know,

1332
01:32:37.48 --> 01:32:44.52
you're just not going to be there. Okay. So now we're not in the military. Uh-huh. No.

1333
01:32:44.52 --> 01:32:49.96
Just saying. And it's less about missing them. We're not missing them. Okay. So at the end of the day,

1334
01:32:49.96 --> 01:32:56.76
no matter what birthday, even right now, you're thinking, if you miss them, no huge deal. No, I mean,

1335
01:32:56.76 --> 01:33:02.44
and if I actually thought it was a huge deal, I would have to choose an entirely different lifestyle

1336
01:33:03.16 --> 01:33:10.92
and life. Right. Right. And I'll tell you what, my kids know. Yeah. Okay. They've always known.

1337
01:33:10.92 --> 01:33:15.80
Okay. Okay. So that's what someone's out there getting after. He's named, he's named my dad.

1338
01:33:15.80 --> 01:33:20.68
Yeah. No, no, no. Okay. He missed another birthday. Don't care. I get you yet. No, you're, I dig it.

1339
01:33:20.68 --> 01:33:27.32
And but that's kind of in a way. I mean, not to be too specific in splitters. But I'm going to do it anyway.

1340
01:33:27.32 --> 01:33:32.76
I mean, not even necessarily you, your specific situation. I wish you the most important

1341
01:33:32.76 --> 01:33:35.96
birthday. Exactly. Right. On the spectrum of value. Okay. Value, you can buy is

1342
01:33:37.08 --> 01:33:43.80
five through 11. Five through 11 are have the most weight most weight. Okay. So not zero. Now

1343
01:33:43.80 --> 01:33:48.52
what they're born. No. So if you, if you missed the birth of your child,

1344
01:33:48.52 --> 01:33:55.24
because you had to work and I'm not saying, military. I'm saying because you're trying to finish some report or something or whatever

1345
01:33:55.72 --> 01:34:01.40
or something. Yeah. You have to do that. Yeah. You're trying to be there. Okay. So but comparatively speaking, the, the birth of your child

1346
01:34:01.40 --> 01:34:07.72
compared to the fifth birthday, you say fifth birthday is more important because they don't remember anything from zero to four. Right.

1347
01:34:07.72 --> 01:34:12.52
That's just a big boom. Dang. That's a good point. And that's,

1348
01:34:12.52 --> 01:34:17.08
this is a big boom. I don't think that's the happening. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Like all those,

1349
01:34:17.08 --> 01:34:22.36
something that was parents that you take your kids and I did this to actually, I didn't, I did it with my first kids

1350
01:34:22.36 --> 01:34:26.52
by way of thinking, we're going to go to take the girls to Disneyland. Yeah. And that's it. Okay.

1351
01:34:26.92 --> 01:34:31.48
Walking around a Disneyland, which is pretty close to a living hell to be actually.

1352
01:34:32.28 --> 01:34:39.72
Standing in lines in the Anaheim summertime. Like just baking. And yeah, you know, here's the deal.

1353
01:34:39.72 --> 01:34:49.48
The girls are just so excited to hold time and so happy. Me? No. So now I haven't been to any of those things in a long time.

1354
01:34:51.80 --> 01:34:56.76
Actually, what we know, a business group and walked around where Disneyland and Disney World.

1355
01:34:57.40 --> 01:35:03.48
And I was like, you've got to go ahead and kill it now. But this is the thing, the kids don't remember.

1356
01:35:03.48 --> 01:35:07.32
You can show them pictures. And they go, oh, that's cool. You could stage those pictures. Like a leg landing.

1357
01:35:07.32 --> 01:35:13.56
Like, yeah, just set them up. And you like, oh, yeah, they're Cinderella, whatever. You seem to be four or five.

1358
01:35:13.56 --> 01:35:17.56
Yeah, five years. Okay. Actually, men, that's a good point because when I say now, I'm sure there's

1359
01:35:17.56 --> 01:35:23.72
developmental things happening when you do things, when you participate in activities with your kids. Obviously.

1360
01:35:23.72 --> 01:35:28.68
Yeah, but you do zero and five. Yeah. But you know, you could probably, it probably be more

1361
01:35:28.68 --> 01:35:35.72
developmentally helpful for you to spend a day with them, you know, coaching them and, yeah,

1362
01:35:35.72 --> 01:35:41.08
Gigiitsu or coaching them and boxing or coaching them and mojtai or coaching them and shooting or coaching

1363
01:35:41.08 --> 01:35:48.60
them in archery or coaching them and hunting small animals or coaching them and how to do combat trauma care.

1364
01:35:49.24 --> 01:35:54.28
And just like general face for your, yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's a

1365
01:35:54.28 --> 01:35:58.92
post like, hey, you go to Disneyland. Look at, yeah, that's not the question is like the birthday thing.

1366
01:35:58.92 --> 01:36:02.44
So, so yeah, only because you mentioned because by 11, they don't care anymore.

1367
01:36:03.48 --> 01:36:08.92
By 11, they don't care. Okay. That's my first time. Well, my kids were like, oh, my birthday

1368
01:36:08.92 --> 01:36:13.32
don't care. Yeah. So, man, that's a good point. We have a rule. You get to picture where you go out for

1369
01:36:13.32 --> 01:36:17.88
dinner on your birthday night. And in the last like five birthdays, we haven't even been able to

1370
01:36:17.88 --> 01:36:23.96
pull out our success for me. Yeah. So obviously, it's gonna be what the group is used to, but as far as

1371
01:36:23.96 --> 01:36:28.20
the kid, if you miss in the birthday for, you know, for the kids, I was a kid, you know what I used to pick?

1372
01:36:28.20 --> 01:36:31.72
Because that used to be in my family too. We get to like pick dinner. You know, it's to pick, yeah,

1373
01:36:31.72 --> 01:36:37.48
chicken patties. Dang, chicken, oh, yeah, from where? Oh, just from the store. Just get some chicken

1374
01:36:37.48 --> 01:36:41.48
patties. I used to love those things. Dang, yeah, I remember in school, I went to Kaloa,

1375
01:36:41.48 --> 01:36:45.48
elementary school. I used to love the chicken patties there. Yeah, they're dope. The chicken patties.

1376
01:36:45.48 --> 01:36:48.92
How do you sound like chicken-micking? No, good, good, good. A big flat chicken-micking nugget. Yeah,

1377
01:36:48.92 --> 01:36:54.12
and I didn't even like, I didn't like steak until I was in the... because we didn't have a lot of

1378
01:36:54.12 --> 01:36:57.32
steak grown-up because steak is expensive. Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, especially that

1379
01:36:57.32 --> 01:37:02.04
really bad. Yeah, especially that rib eye. So we didn't have steak. We had chicken patties. Yeah,

1380
01:37:02.04 --> 01:37:04.68
taste good to me. Pretty dope. And sometimes, you know, what else you're

1381
01:37:04.68 --> 01:37:09.16
of course you want McDonald's when you're seven? Sure. Yeah, it wants goats get some fries in a

1382
01:37:09.16 --> 01:37:16.52
shamrock shaky. We tried, I told, because you know, I love the chocolate chip, right?

1383
01:37:16.52 --> 01:37:23.64
So I had told all my kids about the original mint chocolate chip milkshake was the shamrock shake.

1384
01:37:23.64 --> 01:37:27.96
It McDonald's broken the dirt. Yeah. Which they'd have around same patties day, which by the way,

1385
01:37:27.96 --> 01:37:34.68
isn't around my birthday, but it just made it came in my mind. Yeah. So, so when I was a kid,

1386
01:37:34.68 --> 01:37:41.40
we had shamrock shakes. Same patties day. They're mint shakes. And when I was a kid,

1387
01:37:41.40 --> 01:37:50.12
they were amazing. And I was so... And I hadn't had one in 30 years, maybe, maybe 40 years.

1388
01:37:50.12 --> 01:37:53.96
I hadn't had a shamrock shake. And I saw a little advertisement. I said, oh, kids,

1389
01:37:53.96 --> 01:37:57.96
guess what? These are like mint chocolate chip milkshakes, but there's no chocolate chip. So it's

1390
01:37:57.96 --> 01:38:04.52
just smooth mint ice cream milkshake. From McDonald's? Yep. And I sent my daughter out to

1391
01:38:04.52 --> 01:38:11.80
go get us all. Go get us all the shamrock shakes. Bronum home, they were disgusting. They were

1392
01:38:11.80 --> 01:38:18.36
nothing like what they used to be. So McDonald's, I gave you a shot. Sorry, but yeah.

1393
01:38:18.36 --> 01:38:22.92
I'm surprised you gave him a shot. I am too, but it's been 40 something years since I had a

1394
01:38:22.92 --> 01:38:27.64
shamrock shake. And I remember them. So I figured we'll go with it. Maybe they're disgusting.

1395
01:38:27.64 --> 01:38:31.80
Yeah, they're probably not even my kids like them. Not even my eight-year-old. Dang.

1396
01:38:31.80 --> 01:38:35.000
Who just, you know, is an eight-year-old that just looks at things and say,

1397
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.52
that's ice cream? I don't want it. She didn't even like it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1398
01:38:38.52 --> 01:38:41.96
they were discussing me through them all the way. Dang. So don't waste your money.

1399
01:38:43.16 --> 01:38:45.64
Yeah, don't waste your money. Yeah, don't waste your money. Yeah, don't waste your money. I'm

1400
01:38:45.64 --> 01:38:51.40
McDonald's. That's my personal recommendation. Yeah, period. The shamrock shake or otherwise. Yeah, yeah.

1401
01:38:51.40 --> 01:38:57.64
Yeah, it's not helping you in any way. Did you know that they just, I mean, this is going to

1402
01:38:57.64 --> 01:39:04.28
sound obvious. Now that I'm saying it out loud, they add the green coloring to it. To the ice

1403
01:39:04.28 --> 01:39:08.92
cream. Yeah. Make it green. Well, yeah. Yeah. When you get brires, it's white. Yeah, I got

1404
01:39:08.92 --> 01:39:15.16
years in the chocolate. I mean, my wife and what her family goes to, uh, or the Oregon coast.

1405
01:39:15.16 --> 01:39:19.16
That's where the telemunk cheese factory is. Wait, cheese? Yeah, yeah, yeah, telemunk cheese.

1406
01:39:19.80 --> 01:39:24.60
The actual big factory. And you can go in little tourism and they give you ice cream. Like,

1407
01:39:24.60 --> 01:39:29.64
okay, I want that mint chip, of course. Mm-hmm. And they give you to me. And they handed to me.

1408
01:39:29.64 --> 01:39:34.36
I'm like, first time I see it, I'm like, hey, that's not mine. That's obviously just the regular chocolate.

1409
01:39:34.36 --> 01:39:38.84
It's really a chocolate chip. Yeah, don't over here. And I for real said that. I was like, oh, I ordered

1410
01:39:38.84 --> 01:39:43.000
the mint and it goes, oh, yeah, that's mint. And then it all kind of came to me like, oh, yeah, I'm pretty

1411
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.88
dumb for if you get brires, brires is white. Yeah. Yeah. Which is the preferred brand to be quite honest with you.

1412
01:39:49.88 --> 01:39:53.96
No, is it okay? All right. Well, at least I'll show you that I'm trying. At least the ones that I'm

1413
01:39:53.96 --> 01:40:03.08
attracted. Yeah. So, so back to the birthday thing. If you miss the birthday your child,

1414
01:40:03.08 --> 01:40:08.04
technically you're right, technically for the question, because I'm talking about like how

1415
01:40:08.04 --> 01:40:13.24
upset or how much of the mint is not affected at all. It can't all really. But here's the thing.

1416
01:40:13.80 --> 01:40:18.12
It, like, as a cohesive family, that might be a thing. If you have the option, I'm saying, if you're

1417
01:40:18.12 --> 01:40:24.28
overseas, come on man, let's see. That's a legit, you know, but if you have the choice, so you

1418
01:40:24.28 --> 01:40:28.68
miss the birthday your child, that's more of like a family thing, like, okay, but that's not what

1419
01:40:28.68 --> 01:40:34.20
that's not the question. Because so is the first birthday, the first year birthday, that's kind of

1420
01:40:34.20 --> 01:40:39.80
it's for the adults. Yeah. It's for the second, third, fourth and fifth. Oh, not the fourth and my

1421
01:40:39.80 --> 01:40:44.12
strength. Maybe they're in the game a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, I think in the kitchen. What you do is

1422
01:40:44.12 --> 01:40:49.96
condition them that they don't expect anything good. Yeah, I guess, you know, yeah, life sucks, man.

1423
01:40:49.96 --> 01:40:54.44
Life sucks. Nothing special about your stupid birthday. Every little bunch of people born on that

1424
01:40:54.44 --> 01:41:00.20
that day. Bunch of people born tomorrow. Bunch of people born yesterday. Get over yourself, kid.

1425
01:41:00.84 --> 01:41:04.28
Concure. Four years old. I know a bunch of people turn four.

1426
01:41:04.28 --> 01:41:16.68
Anyway, agree. I think that age two all the way to 21. That's my opinion. Those are ones that

1427
01:41:16.68 --> 01:41:20.92
if they want you there. You, you, you, I don't make that happen. You're not going to want you

1428
01:41:20.92 --> 01:41:29.40
around that or 21st birthday. She better. Yeah, they're one combo. She's not a lot in combo,

1429
01:41:29.40 --> 01:41:38.92
you know that. Check. We're doing more. Yeah. Joko, what do you think about when you don't

1430
01:41:38.92 --> 01:41:50.20
feel like getting out through it? You know, I put this out the other day and I think it's important.

1431
01:41:50.20 --> 01:41:59.88
All right. So Rome wasn't built in the day. We all know that. Everyone's here's that.

1432
01:42:01.16 --> 01:42:12.04
But Rome also didn't fall apart overnight either. It took hundreds of years for Rome to reach

1433
01:42:12.04 --> 01:42:22.28
its peak. But it also took time hundreds of years for Rome to decay and fall apart.

1434
01:42:24.84 --> 01:42:37.88
And that is representative of life because you don't achieve worthwhile goals quickly or easily

1435
01:42:37.88 --> 01:42:49.40
they take time. They take struggle. They take relentless pursuit day in and day out. That's what it takes.

1436
01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:04.12
But also things don't usually fall apart quickly either. At least at first it's a slow process

1437
01:43:04.12 --> 01:43:16.92
a little slip here, a little set back over there, a little wearing down of discipline and will over time.

1438
01:43:20.60 --> 01:43:26.84
That's the thing. Success and failure are generally slow processes.

1439
01:43:26.84 --> 01:43:35.96
Either slowly building things up or gradually tearing them down.

1440
01:43:39.96 --> 01:43:51.88
And that's why I say you've got to pay attention. You have to watch. You have to watch every single

1441
01:43:51.88 --> 01:44:06.76
second because those seconds they turn into minutes and minutes turn into hours and hours

1442
01:44:06.76 --> 01:44:21.56
turn into days and days turn into years. And so that second, that second, the just

1443
01:44:21.56 --> 01:44:33.72
went by, that counted and so did that second. And so did that one. And in those precious seconds

1444
01:44:33.72 --> 01:44:46.04
you were either building or you were decaying. You were either gaining ground or you were losing ground.

1445
01:44:46.04 --> 01:45:11.16
In that second, in every second, every second counts. So make every second count.

1446
01:45:16.04 --> 01:45:31.16
And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo if people want to make it count for this

1447
01:45:31.16 --> 01:45:41.16
podcast. Maybe you could tell them how they can go ahead and do that if they want to. Sure.

1448
01:45:41.16 --> 01:45:50.76
Be happy to actually talk about origin. Why do Pete choose origin as then he told the story.

1449
01:45:52.44 --> 01:45:56.20
Must be slacken on the listening on the moon. Nonetheless, make sense because

1450
01:45:57.40 --> 01:46:07.24
the origin of all these, all the gear is here in the US. It just happens to be. But that's a big

1451
01:46:07.24 --> 01:46:15.88
thing. The origin. So what do we make? Gees out of. So cotton. You know, we'll just take the cotton.

1452
01:46:15.88 --> 01:46:21.64
Grow the cotton in the US. What do they do with the cotton? Turn it into yarn. They do

1453
01:46:21.64 --> 01:46:30.60
yeah, stuff. Die it. Yeah. Turn it into a fabric. Yeah. Very swarms. Yeah. And they do all of that.

1454
01:46:30.60 --> 01:46:36.04
They don't import it from wherever. You know, some undisclosed American hair. Yeah.

1455
01:46:36.04 --> 01:46:40.44
You know, so maybe that's why it's called origin because the origin is a significant thing.

1456
01:46:41.48 --> 01:46:46.20
Anyway, all right. Cool. So origin. What is origin? Origin is the best gear in the world.

1457
01:46:46.20 --> 01:46:51.88
Straight up objectively. Not subjectively. Objectively. I got proof. Boom. So I got a key.

1458
01:46:51.88 --> 01:46:59.48
We went to this origin. Immersion camp for Gitu. Origin. Gitu. Immersion camp. No. Good.

1459
01:46:59.48 --> 01:47:03.88
Fun. By the way. That was your first time in the origin. Ge wasn't it? Yes. I think.

1460
01:47:03.88 --> 01:47:12.28
Can't track. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you with yours. It was cool. Yeah. So cool.

1461
01:47:12.28 --> 01:47:19.80
Camp got the G. Then I come home. Got two by the way. Actually, I got two Githop's.

1462
01:47:20.76 --> 01:47:27.48
One pair of pants. Come home. Maybe want to train more in the G by the way. I thought

1463
01:47:27.48 --> 01:47:32.28
enough it was the G or the camp were both probably both. Yeah. Anyway, so this whole week at

1464
01:47:32.28 --> 01:47:39.24
Trangy. And every single time I went in someone mentioned the G. And it's not like it's pink or

1465
01:47:39.24 --> 01:47:43.72
something like that when they're like, hey, he actually put on his G. Yeah. It's normal. You can get the

1466
01:47:43.72 --> 01:47:49.40
blue. I had the white one and everyone. It's like, oh, what's that Jeff Glover was one of them?

1467
01:47:49.40 --> 01:47:55.64
And this is a person who's like, you know, if he says it, it's something. It's not like some,

1468
01:47:55.64 --> 01:47:59.88
you know, fashion person. It's had like that logo or that's a cool, you know, anyway,

1469
01:47:59.88 --> 01:48:04.60
someone who knows. Anyway, everyone asking like, what up with his G. So I go into the

1470
01:48:04.60 --> 01:48:10.36
speel made here. I might have lost somebody because they took real long saying it, but nonetheless,

1471
01:48:10.36 --> 01:48:15.96
it's dope. And then another one was Jeff Higgs. We know who that is. Higgsie. Do you know who that is?

1472
01:48:15.96 --> 01:48:21.16
I just heard you. Yeah. Yeah. The person that Jocca talks about when he first started to get

1473
01:48:21.16 --> 01:48:26.76
introduced to G. Jitsu, the guy who reintroduced to G. Jitsu. Yeah. He and I got introduced to

1474
01:48:26.76 --> 01:48:33.32
Jitsu Jitsu together. Then he went out and trained hard. Yeah. I think it was the day he got his

1475
01:48:33.32 --> 01:48:37.96
purple belt. His purple house, the white belt. I mean, we trained with Master Chief Bailey

1476
01:48:37.96 --> 01:48:44.28
overseas that for like three months. And then we came back. We were in different cartoons, but

1477
01:48:44.28 --> 01:48:50.28
he started training for real with Fabio Santos. Yeah. And the day he got his purple belt. I'm

1478
01:48:50.28 --> 01:48:54.44
pretty sure was the day he got his purple belt. He came to my house and was like, let's go train.

1479
01:48:54.44 --> 01:48:59.24
Nice it out. Yeah. So think about purple belt versus the white belt. He's a nice lady.

1480
01:48:59.80 --> 01:49:05.48
And you know, triangle arm lock. Yeah. You know, everything. We're naked Jocca. And it's kind of

1481
01:49:05.48 --> 01:49:14.12
tall too. He's tall. Just strong. But beat down. Bony. Bony. Like in terms of when he's impacting

1482
01:49:14.12 --> 01:49:19.48
you with his elbows. Yeah. Real boony. He's hitting you. Yeah. He's got the bones cutting.

1483
01:49:20.28 --> 01:49:23.000
Yeah. He's like, I guess triangle feels like it's going to cut your head off.

1484
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:31.96
Because he's bony. Yeah. Yeah. He knows some good judo too, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he's got a real.

1485
01:49:32.28 --> 01:49:40.52
He's got a real um. He's always in touch with the whole idea of using this to effectively

1486
01:49:41.24 --> 01:49:47.16
defend yourself in a street scenario. Yeah. Always in touch with that. He always adds in a little

1487
01:49:47.16 --> 01:49:53.24
and if you're in the street, you could do this for idea. Yeah. He did that. I went up to studio 540. Yeah.

1488
01:49:55.24 --> 01:49:59.56
For Barry's. I had to train at 10 a.m. I had some stuff I had to do. And then they're only doing

1489
01:49:59.56 --> 01:50:07.64
nogy at the V. So studio 540. He exists teaching the class. Rob's apps. He's the only one. Whatever.

1490
01:50:07.64 --> 01:50:12.68
Even he mentioned the gig. He's like, what is this? Yeah. What's because it's a different material.

1491
01:50:12.68 --> 01:50:19.48
Especially not only specially made, especially woven, especially designed for jitter. Yeah. So yeah.

1492
01:50:19.48 --> 01:50:23.40
And I was like, oh yeah, that's that origin stuff. Don't worry about that. He's like, oh, he's like,

1493
01:50:23.40 --> 01:50:28.52
I think I might have one, you know, he's the kind of with like 1,000. Yeah. I think I have one of these or whatever.

1494
01:50:28.52 --> 01:50:34.04
I was like, you don't have this one pro. And I just kept walking. Anyway, then afterwards it was

1495
01:50:34.04 --> 01:50:39.000
afterward. So in Higgs was like, he's like, this is, I think he even said, this is the most interesting

1496
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.92
gig and he's like, rubbing it in his fingers. You know, when he grabbed my sleeve, this is the most

1497
01:50:42.92 --> 01:50:47.16
interesting gig ever seen. Something like that, you know, went into my chest. That's the axiom.

1498
01:50:47.16 --> 01:50:53.08
G. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With the gorilla weave. Yeah. Because they have a no a pera weave, which is like

1499
01:50:53.08 --> 01:51:01.32
little tiny pera. Yeah. American pearl. But the axiom that gorilla weave is, is, is, where's it?

1500
01:51:01.32 --> 01:51:08.36
The dragon weave. They both look very similar. Yeah. But they're both, we pull. Yeah. One of them looks like,

1501
01:51:08.36 --> 01:51:13.40
like, it's like, I'm not going to say velvet. I'm not going to do that. But it looks like that,

1502
01:51:13.40 --> 01:51:17.08
you know? No, it looks like diamonds. Which one was the one? Remember we were looking at them

1503
01:51:17.08 --> 01:51:21.88
and we were in there saying like, like, I was like, dang, this looks super luxurious. That's

1504
01:51:21.88 --> 01:51:26.76
not the one I have, by the way. It was like this other one. I don't know which one was which. But

1505
01:51:26.76 --> 01:51:32.84
nonetheless, people seem to like think, and the pants are dope. It has the, it's like, you can

1506
01:51:32.84 --> 01:51:37.000
choose drawstring, but it has the, like, you know, like surf shorts. Yeah. Where they have the

1507
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.24
velcro boom and it's like fitted. They go in sizes like of your waist. It's not just like,

1508
01:51:41.24 --> 01:51:46.68
uh, which actually, I'm not against the whole A1, A2, A3, you know, I'm not against that. It's actually

1509
01:51:46.68 --> 01:51:51.64
it's fine. It's cool. Super simple. Um, but this is good. It's like when you get a you can order

1510
01:51:51.64 --> 01:51:57.56
your pants size. Um, boom. So, you know, when you play it on, it's going to be dope. Anyway,

1511
01:51:57.56 --> 01:52:04.36
and it is dope. And, you know, the public responded in that way as well. So, oh, also.

1512
01:52:04.36 --> 01:52:09.000
And Rashguards T-shirts. Yeah. We're going to make a bunch of other stuff. Yeah. Yeah. There's some cool stuff

1513
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000

1514
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.16
G, this week. And let's fresh on my mind. And it's, you know, one of those things that sticks in there.

1515
01:52:18.20 --> 01:52:23.88
Also, at the camp, um, you know how like when you give your laundry, I only have one. Yeah. So you give

1516
01:52:23.88 --> 01:52:28.12
your laundry. You, you're out of G. You can't go to the next session. Unless you get another G, which is kind of

1517
01:52:28.12 --> 01:52:36.12
not, I wasn't really about that. But so I would use them twice in a row. And they dry surprisingly fast.

1518
01:52:36.12 --> 01:52:43.08
It's not even a surprise. They dry fast. They're not 100% cotton. They got polyester. I think in there,

1519
01:52:43.08 --> 01:52:49.80
with silver coated, they not not kidding. It's anti-microbial silver coating on it. Yeah. Not like

1520
01:52:49.80 --> 01:52:54.60
silver. You can see it. Yeah. But yeah, that's one. That's the same thing with mine. When I pulled

1521
01:52:54.60 --> 01:52:58.68
mine out, when I pulled mine out of the washing machine after the spin cycle, it's almost dry. Yeah.

1537
01:54:31.48 --> 01:54:37.56
Sweet. So yeah. Well, the, the, the interesting, not interesting. I guess you could call it layers.

1538
01:54:37.56 --> 01:54:42.36
Is this is exactly what you were taking for years? Yeah. And you were like, hey, guess what?

1539
01:54:42.36 --> 01:54:48.60
Origin in the house. Let's just make that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, some of those have to combine different things before.

1540
01:54:48.60 --> 01:54:54.68
Yeah. But now I don't have to combine anything. Oh, they're already combined. Yeah. We're going to combine it into one.

1541
01:54:54.68 --> 01:55:01.96
Yeah. Well, deal. Yeah. Boom. It's warfare. Joint warfare against joint weakness. Yeah.

1542
01:55:02.60 --> 01:55:07.08
So good. I did it too. By the way, because now I got to get remember when I told the story like,

1543
01:55:07.08 --> 01:55:11.48
you know, when you wake up in my dog. Yes. You told the story. Yeah. I'm going to tell it again. So she's the

1544
01:55:11.48 --> 01:55:16.36
jump on my back when I get up. When you're right, when you wake up, that's your lease warm.

1545
01:55:16.36 --> 01:55:21.64
That's when you're trying to warm up and do physical stuff. The lease warm you'll ever be just in

1546
01:55:21.64 --> 01:55:27.08
everyday life is when you wake up. Yeah. Those first 12 burpees are hard when you do the

1547
01:55:27.08 --> 01:55:32.60
burpees. That moment. So this is the exact moment when my daughter, you know, 40 pounds are so

1548
01:55:32.60 --> 01:55:38.52
jumped on my back. My shoulders. My back or my shoulders, whatever she chose. And, you know, after I took

1549
01:55:38.52 --> 01:55:42.60
Creole for I think it was like five, six days. Boom. I could easily do. I didn't have to like

1550
01:55:42.60 --> 01:55:50.20
focus on my form. Nothing like that. Now I got two kids. And my daughter, whose older is heavier.

1551
01:55:50.20 --> 01:55:57.48
So not this morning. Yes, today morning. I go away, grow up for school or whatever. I already have my

1552
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:03.32
son. He weighs out on all my two ways. But he's one. I have him. She's still wants to jump on my

1553
01:56:03.32 --> 01:56:08.20
shoulder. I have him because he's like, oh, and then he sees her jump on his leg too. So basically, I'm the,

1554
01:56:08.20 --> 01:56:12.84
what do you call it? The vehicle that they're writing on early in the morning, by the way.

1555
01:56:13.80 --> 01:56:20.44
Still no problem. Still going strong. So yeah, man. That's it. That's a joint warfare situation right there.

1556
01:56:20.44 --> 01:56:28.12
And Creole, super cruel. Get on it. You'll be glad you did also check out on it.com slash

1557
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:33.96
Jocco. This is where I get my kettlebells. And I meant I mentioned this. I got the grill on 72 pounds.

1558
01:56:33.96 --> 01:56:40.52
So I'm cruising. Right. Not lifting cruising. And Jade comes. My brother comes and I was like,

1559
01:56:40.52 --> 01:56:44.44
I was like, yeah, I go check out this new kettlebells I got and goes, oh yeah, yeah, this builds

1560
01:56:44.44 --> 01:56:49.08
a cool. I was like, go ahead pick them up. He goes and pick that. It's like kind of heavy, you know.

1561
01:56:49.08 --> 01:56:54.84
But I've been doing kettlebells. I was like, now let me show you. Not even warmed up. Nothing.

1562
01:56:54.84 --> 01:56:58.44
Speaking of Creole oil. Yeah. It was actually really the Creole oil.

1563
01:56:58.44 --> 01:57:05.64
Fucking springing into action. Really. Boom. I do it. And, you know, had to show them what up.

1564
01:57:05.64 --> 01:57:10.20
Nonetheless, that was done with those kettlebells, which are dope, by the way.

1565
01:57:12.76 --> 01:57:17.72
I'm not going to say get the design at once. I'm not going to say that. I think you should.

1566
01:57:18.44 --> 01:57:22.04
But I'm not going to say to do that. I say go on there on it.

1567
01:57:22.04 --> 01:57:28.92

01:57:41.88 --> 01:57:47.96
jockel. Jockel doesn't care about that stuff. Don't get addicted to the interesting

1571
01:57:47.96 --> 01:57:53.64
information. Like I did. I think I'm past that addiction now. But, you know, you do run that risk.

1572
01:57:53.64 --> 01:57:59.72

1581
01:58:58.76 --> 01:59:03.24
though. Yeah. It's not like a tragic story, which you kind of felt like when you mentioned it. I was like,

1582
01:59:03.24 --> 01:59:12.92
well, it brought me back. Okay. So, here's the story. We go to Maine, right? Technically,

1583
01:59:12.92 --> 01:59:18.28
we go to Boston. Then drive to Maine. Yeah. Right. So, you know, to dry, to dry, then you

1584
01:59:18.28 --> 01:59:24.20
we rent a car. Well, you know, the car rental place. And I have three bags. Well, you have what one,

1585
01:59:24.20 --> 01:59:30.36
two. Yeah, two bags. So five bags. My computer bag and my suitcase. Yeah. So five bags total. I have a

1586
01:59:30.36 --> 01:59:37.96
big bag with equipment in it. suitcase with, you know, uh, do you just stop and closing what not? And then

1587
01:59:37.96 --> 01:59:44.12
the third bag, which was a carry on, big, big, you know, most important. Most important has a, um,

1588
01:59:44.12 --> 01:59:50.68
it has an important camera in there that I use. My, my favorite camera I have ever had. Really good camera.

1589
01:59:52.12 --> 01:59:58.36
Has some value to it, we'll say. And it's a red camera. Yeah, it's red. Yeah, I picked W,

1590
01:59:58.36 --> 02:00:04.04
you technically red, FW. Yeah. It's, it's a awesome camera. Is it the best you can buy?

1591
02:00:04.04 --> 02:00:09.24
Is there one more? It depends on what you mean, but best, but it's, yeah, there's one sort of level.

1592
02:00:09.24 --> 02:00:14.20
Okay. Well, I'll put you this, an an cheap. No. It ain't cheap at all. In some places in the country,

1593
02:00:14.20 --> 02:00:19.24
you go buy a house for the cost of this camera. Yeah. So it's an expensive camera. Yeah. And

1594
02:00:19.24 --> 02:00:24.04
and you'd think like, okay, Echo's going to take really good care of this. Yeah, which I do. Really,

1595
02:00:24.04 --> 02:00:27.56
that's why I carry it on. Yeah. Boom, boom, boom. There isn't even trust anyone touching it.

1596
02:00:27.56 --> 02:00:31.64
He's going to carry it with him. Yeah. Okay. Continue. So boom, we get a rental car. We got a

1597
02:00:31.64 --> 02:00:36.20
parent league got five bags to account for. There was no, there's some kind of confusion.

1598
02:00:36.20 --> 02:00:39.24
You know what happens? Yes, there was. Yes, remember? Because remember when you're,

1599
02:00:39.24 --> 02:00:42.84
when you're getting in, what was like an expedition, something like that. And now those

1600
02:00:42.84 --> 02:00:48.84
new ones have that automatic tail door that goes up. Yeah. And you know what it was? I think

1601
02:00:48.84 --> 02:00:53.72
there's like a sensor under the bumper that if you like put your foot under there, it closes. Like,

1602
02:00:53.72 --> 02:00:57.80
if, you know, like a hands-free closing in the different situations. So the thing started closing on

1603
02:00:57.80 --> 02:01:03.56
the window. Yeah. And the girl, the rental girl was trying to save me. Yeah. And she couldn't.

1604
02:01:03.56 --> 02:01:07.64
Yeah. So he was too strong for it, which was kind of funny because I didn't even care.

1605
02:01:07.64 --> 02:01:12.12
But I just kind of like put my back into it and stop. But I was watching her kind of chuckling.

1606
02:01:12.12 --> 02:01:15.96
She's trying to stop it and it wasn't stopping. Yeah. She was looking and she had a look on her face.

1607
02:01:15.96 --> 02:01:20.60
Like, I was about to die. Yeah. She was trying to work. You know, like, Indian Jones, I was going to

1608
02:01:20.60 --> 02:01:25.32
get my head cut off by the door slamming shot. And I was just kind of like laughing at the whole

1609
02:01:25.32 --> 02:01:29.48
situation. Yeah. But that caused some confusion apparently. It was like your mind. It was like a

1610
02:01:29.48 --> 02:01:34.76
little micro emergency that happened. And so I was like boom flustered, but wait, what all the bags

1611
02:01:34.76 --> 02:01:39.08
are in or not. And we're trying to fit. Remember, because we were trying to get the seats down.

1612
02:01:39.08 --> 02:01:44.36
Yeah. There's like maybe three quasi major things going on. No, no. No.

1613
02:01:44.36 --> 02:01:50.52
Let's go on. And, you know, for the psych store, I'm just going to continue. So. We get it.

1614
02:01:50.52 --> 02:01:57.16
All all all all. I thought it was just everyone for us. We get it all loaded. And at one point,

1615
02:01:57.16 --> 02:02:01.32
like we're like halfway up. There's a three hour drive by the way, if we don't stop and we did stop.

1616
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:04.04
So it was like five hours or something like that. So we stop and remember, hey,

1617
02:02:04.04 --> 02:02:11.32
stop. I got fried chicken by the way. It's good. It was really good. I love it. I was stoked.

1618
02:02:11.32 --> 02:02:18.04
Nonetheless, I had a thought and it was literally lasted three seconds. Like, I don't really remember

1619
02:02:18.04 --> 02:02:23.32
putting my camera bag in the car. But what am I to do? Not putting in the car? It's like the

1620
02:02:23.32 --> 02:02:28.44
most important bag. So whatever. So we just continue. We get up there. And right as we pull into,

1621
02:02:28.44 --> 02:02:34.28
like, park, like, five seconds before hours later, we're in the back country of Maine. Yeah.

1622
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.40
Like, not even knowing. Yeah. First time there by the way, which I don't know what that even means.

1623
02:02:39.40 --> 02:02:45.16
But either way, we're there. And I'm all pumped up. Yeah. I could have noticed my rib. I was stoked

1624
02:02:45.16 --> 02:02:50.20
to go in and see everybody in hang out. Yeah. You can see everyone's inside the light of the gym.

1625
02:02:50.20 --> 02:02:54.36
Yeah. So they can't see that we're outside. Yeah. So I'm all but I'm stoked. So it's yeah, the beginning

1626
02:02:54.36 --> 02:03:00.68
of the deal. The adventure. If you will. And right as we kind of roll to a stop, I'm thinking, man,

1627
02:03:00.68 --> 02:03:04.52
did I? You know, you kind of count we're here. And now you start to count for it. And I don't

1628
02:03:04.52 --> 02:03:07.80
remember that stuff. So the first thing I do I look in the back seat, because that's where it would have

1629
02:03:07.80 --> 02:03:14.76
went. Not there. And I look in the back, not there. And you know, you get that cold feeling that just rushes

1630
02:03:14.76 --> 02:03:21.72
over your body. Oh my God. So like man. So whatever I tell you and you're like, oh, you know,

1631
02:03:21.72 --> 02:03:25.24
get on the phone, you know, call the airport in Braille. You ever tried to call the airport in the airport?

1632
02:03:25.24 --> 02:03:30.20
Yeah. I was. Yeah. Okay. I told you this afterwards. My opinion was at that point. I was like,

1633
02:03:30.20 --> 02:03:36.52
that thing's gone. 100%. 99. Gone. Yeah. 99.99. 99% you're never going to see that thing again.

1634
02:03:36.52 --> 02:03:41.56
I had already cut it away emotionally into cash from it. And I was kind of throwing you bones like,

1635
02:03:41.56 --> 02:03:46.60
yeah, call the airport. Maybe they can help you. That was actually nice of you. Like, because you

1636
02:03:46.60 --> 02:03:50.12
really, you seem like you cared not necessarily about the camera necessarily, but you cared about me.

1637
02:03:50.12 --> 02:03:53.48
You know, like, early. I thought that thing was gone. There's no chance you're getting it back

1638
02:03:53.48 --> 02:03:58.52
it over it. Yeah. And I was a little bit, what I said, you know, is there podcast recorded that you

1639
02:03:58.52 --> 02:04:02.52
don't have copies of on there? And you said, no, they're all uploaded. I was a good thing.

1640
02:04:02.52 --> 02:04:07.32
Yeah. Yeah. Because we're never going to see that thing again. Yeah. And I was thinking, I'll see it again

1641
02:04:07.32 --> 02:04:12.84
in three months, maybe when they finally recover it from Austin found from the Boston airport,

1642
02:04:12.84 --> 02:04:18.76
by the way. Or I get my insurance money for it down the line and they've got to go

1643
02:04:19.56 --> 02:04:24.28
go through the purchase process. We just think they've got Jack. And but we don't have it for this trip

1644
02:04:24.28 --> 02:04:31.32
for sure. And later on, I found out or realized that we have the podcast like SD cards in there. So

1645
02:04:31.32 --> 02:04:35.08
why don't we get guess we could just spot something anyway nonetheless. We get there. And I'm calling

1646
02:04:35.08 --> 02:04:41.72
the airport and right one the airport recording picks up. Yeah, just get this feeling like,

1647
02:04:41.72 --> 02:04:45.000
oh my gosh, I'm just completely going through the motions right now. No one's going to pick up

1648
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.36
and be like, sure, I'll look for it. Yeah, I got it. No one, that's not going to happen.

1649
02:04:49.24 --> 02:04:53.000
But I keep calling. I'm like, I'm not going to be the guy who didn't do everything I can. So I'm calling

1650
02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.60
it whatever. Meanwhile, we got to go talk to Pete. We got to, you know, all this stuff. Actually,

1651
02:04:56.60 --> 02:05:00.20
you released me. You go, hey, man, go ahead. I'll make these calls. And I was like, okay, cool, you hang out.

1652
02:05:00.20 --> 02:05:04.20
Yeah. Just make this totally worthless effort because you're never seeing that thing again. I'll

1653
02:05:04.20 --> 02:05:08.92
go hang out with people. Yeah. So after a few minutes that I go in, I'm like, you know what, let me

1654
02:05:08.92 --> 02:05:14.12
whatever. Let me kind of cut it away as they say and let me at least embrace that, you know,

1655
02:05:14.12 --> 02:05:19.64
what we're doing. Go in and you kind of casually in a way mentioned like, hey, there's some

1656
02:05:19.64 --> 02:05:25.08
guys from the police department. If that came across casually, casually, I shouldn't have made it

1657
02:05:25.08 --> 02:05:29.24
come up because I met a bunch of guys, you know, everyone was saying hi and a couple of guys,

1658
02:05:29.24 --> 02:05:34.84
you know, yeah, we're cops and Riviera down in Massachusetts and, you know, right by Boston.

1659
02:05:34.84 --> 02:05:41.88
Yeah, right next to them. And I met them and then you strolled back in and you met a couple of people.

1660
02:05:42.44 --> 02:05:46.12
And then I said, you talked to anybody. Well, yeah, I talked to this and, you know, they're going to look

1661
02:05:46.12 --> 02:05:50.92
whatever. I'm thinking the out of things gone. And I said, you know, if there's anyone in the world that could

1662
02:05:50.92 --> 02:05:59.16
like make something happen right now, it's cops. Yeah, it's, it's, it's Boston cops, Riviera cops. And

1663
02:05:59.16 --> 02:06:05.96
what I'm not, and I just said, I said, bro, and I was a little, this is my ego. I was embarrassed for you.

1664
02:06:06.76 --> 02:06:13.88
I felt bad that you had to go and tell somebody that you lost this sick camera. And so I just said,

1665
02:06:13.88 --> 02:06:17.40
hey, man, those guys over there, their cops and if there's anyone that gets going to get this

1666
02:06:17.40 --> 02:06:23.16
thing back, it's them. Yeah. And I'm thinking, you know, the whole story where like,

1667
02:06:23.96 --> 02:06:29.32
did you see this, so did you not think that they were going to be able to help? I thought that they'd be like,

1668
02:06:29.32 --> 02:06:34.12
oh, you lost your bag. Like, everyone does every single day at that airport. Oh,

1669
02:06:34.12 --> 02:06:38.84
work cops, bro. We have crimes to solve. Yeah. No, I'm not going to get your stupid

1670
02:06:38.84 --> 02:06:43.08
attitude of that thing being gone actually changed. As soon as I connected this,

1671
02:06:43.08 --> 02:06:46.68
I said to myself, oh, they're cops. We're going to turn this over to them and they can make things happen.

1672
02:06:46.68 --> 02:06:51.80
Yeah, that's good. And even me, when I was like, okay, I'm going to mention it to these cops,

1673
02:06:51.80 --> 02:06:57.000
in these cops, you're going to be like, what do you think our job is, you know, to go recover

1674
02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:01.80
your lost luggage? Like, do three hours away, by the way? No, so I'm like, you know what,

1675
02:07:01.80 --> 02:07:05.24
Jockel said to do it, I'm just going to do it. This is another go through the motion thing.

1676
02:07:05.24 --> 02:07:13.48
So I kind of timidly go Dennis and Nate every there. They just rolled it whatever and I was like,

1677
02:07:13.48 --> 02:07:17.000
can I lost a bit? And they were like, like, what did it look like? Like they kind of were into it.

1678
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.60
I was like, oh, this is promising. You know, like they actually care because I was thinking they'd be like,

1679
02:07:20.60 --> 02:07:24.76
man, that's a sad story. Bro, I'm going to go talk to Jockel again. You know, kind of thing. I thought that

1680
02:07:24.76 --> 02:07:29.80
was going to happen. And they were like, no, bro, they get on the phone. Yeah. And they're like,

1681
02:07:29.80 --> 02:07:32.92
what did it look like? Boom. One more question, like, well, where did you leave it? Okay,

1682
02:07:32.92 --> 02:07:38.20
boom, back on the phone, back on the phone, these two guys, I'm like, oh, this is it's starting to kind of

1683
02:07:38.20 --> 02:07:42.44
look up, and he's like, okay, so the hang of the phone is just a waiting game now, just a matter of time.

1684
02:07:42.44 --> 02:07:46.68
I got this, I got this guy, I'm like, for real. They're like, yeah, man, just waiting in. So we're talking.

1685
02:07:46.68 --> 02:07:53.000
They called, they called all the rows out there. And there's like a force of troops over there to get in there,

1686
02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
had that thing recovering. What? 20 minutes. So they hang up and they're like, just a matter of

1687
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.16
time. And then we just start talking about other stuff. Yeah. You know, kind of teasing me a little bit,

1688
02:08:03.16 --> 02:08:07.24
whatever I deserve it, probably even 10 times that. But, and then we're talking about other stuff. Boom,

1689
02:08:07.24 --> 02:08:12.20
it's phone rings. He's on it. He's like, is it of the mind shift bag and all this, describe it? I don't

1690
02:08:12.20 --> 02:08:17.40
even know. That's all out of the, I'm like, yeah, I think so. Go inside and he's any, any bus

1691
02:08:17.40 --> 02:08:22.04
up my laptop or whatever. It's matching the description. And in my mind, I'm like, there's no way

1692
02:08:22.04 --> 02:08:28.04
he found it. Like, a cop's not going to just roll into the Logan airport and find my bag. No,

1693
02:08:28.04 --> 02:08:31.16
the only way that's going to happen. But sure enough, he's like, oh, yeah, frag,

1694
02:08:31.16 --> 02:08:36.20
muck. Because it has a frag mob sticker on my, oh, my laptop. He's like, fragmob was like,

1695
02:08:36.20 --> 02:08:41.56
that old cold feeling turned into just warm and love and rainbows on this guy. I was like,

1696
02:08:41.56 --> 02:08:45.24
that's the one. They're like, and, you know, they're kind of, they didn't actually high five,

1697
02:08:45.24 --> 02:08:49.000
but they're kind of like, almost like, you know, this is this little task. They kind of bonded

1698
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.44
in just like that. 20 minutes, man. It, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it,

1699
02:08:52.44 --> 02:08:59.56
and then one of which over. Robby. Yeah. That's his name, Robby. Yeah, I own him a role.

1700
02:09:00.60 --> 02:09:05.08
Actually, there was another guy, Kalahan, who was the guy who went and grabbed. So he was like a

1701
02:09:05.08 --> 02:09:12.44
coordinated deal man. Yeah. And man, that was like, one of the more heroic things that has happened to me

1702
02:09:12.44 --> 02:09:17.88
in the recent past. So got the camera back. Got the camera back. And the computer. Yeah.

1703
02:09:17.88 --> 02:09:21.96
And we're good. So in the event. So the point is in the event of you shopping for cameras,

1704
02:09:21.96 --> 02:09:26.92
can't get a red camera on Amazon, but if you want to get like a Sony HD handy camp, you know,

1705
02:09:26.92 --> 02:09:30.60
well, whatever you're using because it broke in the luggage. I'm not saying that happened to me.

1706
02:09:30.60 --> 02:09:33.40
I'm just saying if that ever happens, you want to get another one. Boom. You can go through their

1707
02:09:33.40 --> 02:09:39.000
jockels start.com. Click through. And thanks to everyone that got that camera back. Yeah,

1708
02:09:39.64 --> 02:09:44.76
much appreciated. And the laptop with all kinds of videos and important stuff on it. Yeah,

1709
02:09:44.76 --> 02:09:50.92
actually, there's guys around the laptop, but yeah, man. Denison Nate, the primary guys.

1710
02:09:50.92 --> 02:09:56.84
Mr. Callahan. I didn't meet him, but he's done with the guys you recovered that. And then

1711
02:09:56.84 --> 02:10:03.08
Robby, I owe you a role. Oh, you two rules. I owe you a lot, man. Yeah. He's one who delivered it.

1714
02:10:17.96 --> 02:10:21.24
oh, yeah, you subscribed already, but some people and maybe they didn't. Maybe they're just kind of

1716
02:10:26.36 --> 02:10:31.08
Blitz, you're gonna unsubscribe if we're not delivering value. I don't like to use that expression

1717
02:10:31.08 --> 02:10:35.72
adding value. Because when you do this, it thinks it's cool. I thought it was cool. Nonetheless,

1718
02:10:35.72 --> 02:10:41.32
if we're not adding value, you can not subscribe if you want. Also, subscribe on YouTube.

1719
02:10:41.32 --> 02:10:47.96
What's the recent development? Oh, your book. This book is a pretty,

1720
02:10:47.96 --> 02:10:54.04
feel manual. You'll manual, which you'll talk about later. Yeah, we put a video on there.

1721
02:10:54.04 --> 02:11:01.08
It kind of little summary. I was real excited to see that video come out. Yeah. And I was,

1722
02:11:02.76 --> 02:11:05.96
you know, we were texting back and forth. And you said, well, how about, you know, we,

1723
02:11:05.96 --> 02:11:09.96
well, I'll put it out tomorrow, but it's ready. And I said, just pull it out now. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1724
02:11:09.96 --> 02:11:17.24
later. And then you said launching in three, two. And then it was, and I went to my YouTube or my phone.

1725
02:11:17.24 --> 02:11:23.96
And I was refreshing refreshing refreshing refreshing refreshing and I wanted to catch it. Like the first

1726
02:11:23.96 --> 02:11:30.04
person to catch it, I'm refreshing refreshing refreshing. And this happened. I got a ping for my mail

1727
02:11:30.04 --> 02:11:38.84
on my phone. And I switched to mail. And it said, jocco podcast is uploaded a new video. So that's

1728
02:11:38.84 --> 02:11:43.48
one of the benefits of subscribe to the YouTube channel. If something comes out, you can have it email you

1729
02:11:43.48 --> 02:11:47.48
if you want it to. If you can have it email you, when something new comes out. And otherwise,

1730
02:11:47.48 --> 02:11:52.12
there's no way you'd know. Yeah. So if you, if you care about that kind of stuff, um, which, you know,

1731
02:11:52.12 --> 02:11:55.88
this one of those deals where, yeah, sure, you get the video version of the podcast.

1732
02:11:56.84 --> 02:12:01.80
If you care what we look like, just fine. Actually, people play it on their TV, like, in their

1733
02:12:01.80 --> 02:12:05.88
little home gym or something like that, which, it's kind of like we're all there together, you know.

1734
02:12:05.88 --> 02:12:12.12
Yeah. Um, and then, yeah, some excerpts in there. The video that you made for the book. Yeah. I think it

1735
02:12:12.12 --> 02:12:17.32
might be your best video ever. It might be. I think it's up there, man. I was, yeah, I was talking.

1736
02:12:17.32 --> 02:12:23.48
It's real good. I was talking to somebody on Facebook and they were like, oh, hey, that video's cool.

1737
02:12:24.36 --> 02:12:28.12
And I thought about saying, oh, that was a good man. Thanks for that. But I thought about it.

1738
02:12:28.12 --> 02:12:32.60
I was like, wait, jocco kind of did all the work. Really, you know, you're the one working out.

1739
02:12:32.60 --> 02:12:37.16
You're words. You say in the words. I said, all I did was put some cool music in some words on there.

1740
02:12:37.16 --> 02:12:41.48
I, yeah, but you made all that other stuff happen in there. The words in the way it's all coordinated

1741
02:12:41.48 --> 02:12:47.32
together and all that stuff. So it's like something. None the last, you know what, to be honest, I like how it came

1742
02:12:47.32 --> 02:12:52.92
out to. Yeah. He's good. He's very, he can get by to the best one. Hey, man, you know, it depends on what you mean by

1743
02:12:52.92 --> 02:12:59.24
best, you know, I don't know. Impactful. And then back, well, sure, it's a good one. I liked it. Yeah,

1744
02:12:59.24 --> 02:13:04.44
it was, but if someone wasn't subscribed to the YouTube channel, they might not never know that that video exists.

1745
02:13:04.44 --> 02:13:11.08
That's true. And that that's that hurts. Or no Facebook or no Twitter or no nothing. Yeah.

1746
02:13:11.08 --> 02:13:17.40
Yeah. So choose your, your, well, I tweeted that one out, but I don't always tweet out when something comes out.

1747
02:13:17.40 --> 02:13:22.28
Yeah, that's true. You know, you don't always do that. Sure. So if you're subscribed, you'll know.

1748
02:13:22.28 --> 02:13:26.44
Really? That's what my actions are. That's true. And you know, choose whether or not you want to

1749
02:13:26.44 --> 02:13:30.84
alert. You know, sometimes you don't want that alert every single time, but sometimes you do, you know,

1750
02:13:31.64 --> 02:13:35.72
I'll put some deleted scenes on there as well. Anyway, nonetheless, yeah, YouTube channel. We have one

1751
02:13:35.72 --> 02:13:41.88
and it's cool. I think it's cool. Jockel thinks it's cool. I just got a little thing. YouTube kind of

1752
02:13:41.88 --> 02:13:45.88
changed their look on YouTube. I don't know if you noticed that. Well, it's hard for me to judge

1753
02:13:45.88 --> 02:13:53.08
because I have YouTube read now. No, no ads. So dope. Nonetheless, I like that. Ads. Actually,

1754
02:13:53.08 --> 02:13:59.000
they did a good thing with ads. Now, now you can click like I don't like this ad or you can give that.

1755
02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:04.92
So you can kind of narrow down the ads you see. I like the movie trailer ads, you know?

1756
02:14:06.12 --> 02:14:10.20
I don't like any ads. I didn't watch what I want to watch. Everyone else get away from me.

1757
02:14:10.20 --> 02:14:15.96
Yeah, I did it, then. I did it fully. Nonetheless, point there is subscribe. Subscribe to the YouTube

1758
02:14:15.96 --> 02:14:22.12
channel is a good way of supporting the podcast. If you want to. Also, Jockel is a store.

1759
02:14:22.12 --> 02:14:26.76
It's called Jockel Store. JockelStore.com. Of course,

1760
02:14:27.96 --> 02:14:32.52
very creative name. By the way, I guess technically I came up with the name. Yeah, you did.

1761
02:14:33.48 --> 02:14:39.40
Just store. Is your store Jockel Store? I concurred with the name. Yeah. So, what do we have on the

1762
02:14:39.40 --> 02:14:46.20
store? If you don't know already, we've got shirts on there. Rash guards, travel mugs, some bumper

1763
02:14:46.20 --> 02:14:53.48
stickers, patches, hats, bulk hat hats. Not like, did you bring mine today? Top hats. You don't look

1764
02:14:53.48 --> 02:14:58.20
like you did. Yeah, no, I didn't. I'm nervous. I'm sorry, but. You owe me nine.

1765
02:15:00.92 --> 02:15:05.40
Nonetheless, they're on there. JockelStore.com. I guess technically you could go to your own store

1766
02:15:05.40 --> 02:15:09.64
and get a hat or nine hats as it case means you. Okay, I'll do that today. Thank you.

1767
02:15:09.64 --> 02:15:14.60
Yeah, if you want, if you want to. So women's stuff on there, some hoodies. We want to get a

1768
02:15:14.60 --> 02:15:18.60
thicker hoodie. That's what we're doing right now. I know you said. Yeah, a bunch of times.

1769
02:15:19.56 --> 02:15:33.08
But yeah, we'll work on that. So there are boom hoodies. I think what's the next move? What's the next

1770
02:15:33.08 --> 02:15:38.92
thing? Winner hoodie. Winner hoodie? Yeah, I think it should be. I think I'm going to put a

1771
02:15:38.92 --> 02:15:44.44
warrior kid rash guard on there too for for warrior kids doing no Gigi Jitsu or even Gigi, you know,

1772
02:15:44.44 --> 02:15:50.04
you wear the rash guard on your Gigi sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. I think that we do. All cool stuff.

1773
02:15:50.04 --> 02:15:57.08
Nonetheless, JockelStore, that's where you get JockelStuff. It's pretty cool. So I'm not saying

1774
02:15:57.08 --> 02:16:01.88
to buy something. I'm saying go on there. Check it out. If you like something, get something.

1775
02:16:01.88 --> 02:16:09.000
Good way to support. Also psychological warfare. If you didn't know what that is, it is an album with

1776
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:16.36
tracks. JockelTrucks. It's JockelStuff to you. So if you listen to it, it's not like a story.

1777
02:16:17.16 --> 02:16:21.24
Right? Like a lot, you know, a lot of times it's not music. Obviously, it's not JockelStore,

1778
02:16:21.24 --> 02:16:26.28
singing hard core, which you do from time to time. By the way, you're ever writing and here's

1779
02:16:26.28 --> 02:16:31.56
the kind of a rhetorical question. Okay, have you ever ridden not you Jockel, but the people out there. Have

1780
02:16:31.56 --> 02:16:37.40
you ever ridden with Jockel for five hours or three to five hours in a car? No, okay. Let me tell

1781
02:16:37.40 --> 02:16:43.80
you what it's like, part of what it's like. It's Jockel drumming even in the airplane, by the way,

1782
02:16:43.80 --> 02:16:49.000
drumming on what you call that, the handle in the door. Like you're doing like drums. Boom. And then

1783
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.68
singing under his breath, hard core stuff. What else are you singing? Pretty good. It's like Tom Petty. It

1784
02:16:54.68 --> 02:16:59.32
wasn't Tom Petty. It was something. Anyway. I have no idea. Yeah. But it was songs. I was

1785
02:16:59.32 --> 02:17:03.000
I know as ever, occasionally I had a look at you and you'd be looking like, can you please stop?

1786
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:08.84
Yeah, yeah. Which I got to kick out of me. Yeah, do a boy. Yeah, or stop the car and like get out

1787
02:17:09.48 --> 02:17:15.64
or something. Yeah, you get out and walk. Yeah, and play drums. That was the look for sure. Yeah. Wait,

1788
02:17:15.64 --> 02:17:22.12
no, you get out. Stop playing drums and get out. That was the look. Nonetheless, these tracks are not

1789
02:17:22.12 --> 02:17:30.04
that. They're him, him, Jockel, talking to you, telling you, pragmatic ways to get over your current

1790
02:17:30.04 --> 02:17:36.04
weakness, what weakness. Okay. So let's say you're trying to stick to a good diet. Right. Try to wake

1791
02:17:36.04 --> 02:17:45.32
up early or all of that stuff. Right. At this moment, actually. Yeah, currently. I guess technically,

1792
02:17:45.32 --> 02:17:50.92
I'm passing two because they ate a salad. Oh, just a hardcore workout to yesterday and today,

1793
02:17:50.92 --> 02:17:58.60
rolled last night 70% ribs of a little tweak still, but Andy, Dean, light rolls,

1794
02:17:58.60 --> 02:18:05.24
little bit with name. I think that was it. But yeah, no, last thing the whole time. Yeah. Yeah.

1795
02:18:05.24 --> 02:18:11.48
Dang. Yep. So technically, am I fasting if I ate a salad at like 11. 45 last night?

1796
02:18:11.48 --> 02:18:17.64
Well, yeah. I know, is it? I drank some coffee. Yeah. Fast enough, right? Fast 24 hour fast. No.

1797
02:18:17.64 --> 02:18:21.24
No. Oh, 12 hour fast. No. Yeah. I'm not fasting. No. I'm not. No. I'm not. I've never had a

1798
02:18:21.24 --> 02:18:26.20
quick move. Is there such thing as an eight hour fast? I think that's just life.

1799
02:18:26.20 --> 02:18:31.56
When is the, I mean, it's like, No, for. If you're not doing, if you're not doing at least 12 hours,

1800
02:18:31.56 --> 02:18:37.40
okay, 12 hours is the cut-off for killing it. If I don't know what the cut-off is using. I'm not a doctor.

1801
02:18:37.40 --> 02:18:41.48
Yeah, but you were even at your audition. Well, you're fasting right now, currently. Yeah. What if

1802
02:18:41.48 --> 02:18:43.48
like you just didn't eat yet.

1803
02:18:43.48 --> 02:18:43.98
Whatever.

1804
02:18:43.98 --> 02:18:44.98
Then I just didn't eat yet.

1805
02:18:44.98 --> 02:18:45.98
There's a difference.

1806
02:18:45.98 --> 02:18:46.18
Yeah.

1807
02:18:46.18 --> 02:18:47.38
So what's the difference?

1808
02:18:47.38 --> 02:18:48.38
That's the question.

1809
02:18:48.38 --> 02:18:48.88
I don't know.

1810
02:18:48.88 --> 02:18:49.38
I don't know.

1811
02:18:49.38 --> 02:18:51.28
Hey, your man of humility, you say,

1812
02:18:51.28 --> 02:18:52.08
you don't know when you don't know.

1813
02:18:52.08 --> 02:18:52.78
I like that.

1814
02:18:52.78 --> 02:18:54.68
Nonetheless, back to psychological warfare.

1815
02:18:54.68 --> 02:18:59.48
If you're trying to stand the fast or wake up early every morning,

1816
02:18:59.48 --> 02:19:04.58
you know, or stick to the diet, stay on the program,

1817
02:19:04.58 --> 02:19:09.98
whatever, in whatever way, ways that you have opportunities to slip.

1818
02:19:09.98 --> 02:19:16.08
This is an album with tracks that tell you why you shouldn't slip on your waking up early.

1819
02:19:16.08 --> 02:19:20.88
You're diet, you're working out my whole thing, you know, like I've said before.

1820
02:19:20.88 --> 02:19:23.28
If I don't feel like working out, I kind of tend to be like,

1821
02:19:23.28 --> 02:19:24.28
well, maybe I'll rest today.

1822
02:19:24.28 --> 02:19:25.18
Maybe I'll do it later.

1823
02:19:25.18 --> 02:19:26.28
You know, that whole thing.

1824
02:19:26.28 --> 02:19:26.88
Not good.

1825
02:19:26.88 --> 02:19:28.48
Yeah, this helps with that.

1826
02:19:28.48 --> 02:19:32.38
It'll just tell you like why it'll, how in a nutshell,

1827
02:19:32.38 --> 02:19:37.08
it tells you the benefits of not slipping and the repercussions of slipping.

1828
02:19:37.08 --> 02:19:38.58
That's in a pragmatic way.

1829
02:19:38.58 --> 02:19:40.38
But it's jocquatelling it to you, so it works.

1830
02:19:40.38 --> 02:19:41.28
100% of the time.

1831
02:19:41.28 --> 02:19:42.08
My experience.

1832
02:19:42.08 --> 02:19:43.38
Speaking of fasting.

1833
02:19:44.38 --> 02:19:46.58
People ask me this all the time when you're fasting.

1834
02:19:46.58 --> 02:19:47.88
Do you eat anything?

1835
02:19:47.88 --> 02:19:48.68
Yeah.

1836
02:19:48.68 --> 02:19:49.18
I do.

1837
02:19:49.18 --> 02:19:49.98
Actually.

1838
02:19:49.98 --> 02:19:50.78
Sunflower seeds.

1839
02:19:50.78 --> 02:19:51.78
Sunflower seeds?

1840
02:19:51.78 --> 02:19:55.38
Because it takes you like 37 minutes to have one little tiny seed

1841
02:19:55.38 --> 02:19:56.38
to get it chewed up.

1842
02:19:56.38 --> 02:19:59.58
So it's, but they're, but they're good because they keep you occupied

1843
02:19:59.58 --> 02:20:02.58
and you're chewing and they taste good and blah, blah, blah, blah.

1844
02:20:02.58 --> 02:20:10.58
Sometimes I'll grab a handful of nuts, mix nuts, just maybe one in the morning,

1845
02:20:10.58 --> 02:20:13.58
maybe one at night, yeah, one handful.

1846
02:20:13.58 --> 02:20:18.58
And jocquat, that's the, the things.

1847
02:20:18.58 --> 02:20:22.58
Now sometimes I won't eat the nuts, but I don't know.

1848
02:20:22.58 --> 02:20:26.18
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

1849
02:20:26.18 --> 02:20:29.58
do you gotta be careful that you don't have 13 handfuls of nuts?

1850
02:20:29.58 --> 02:20:32.38
Yeah, because I'm like I'm just talking like a handful of nuts, right?

1851
02:20:32.38 --> 02:20:36.58
Um, but jocquat, I have that for sure.

1852
02:20:36.58 --> 02:20:40.78
And you know what, if you call me now or you want to put like, oh, you weren't really

1853
02:20:40.78 --> 02:20:44.18
fasting because you have jocquat, you have a handful of nuts.

1854
02:20:44.18 --> 02:20:46.98
I mean, if you think about the amount of calories that I burn on a daily basis,

1855
02:20:46.98 --> 02:20:50.18
a handful of nuts is basically insignificant.

1856
02:20:50.18 --> 02:20:52.18
But whatever, maybe I'm doing it wrong.

1857
02:20:52.18 --> 02:20:53.18
That's okay.

1858
02:20:53.18 --> 02:20:54.18
I'm just telling you what I'm doing.

1859
02:20:54.18 --> 02:20:55.18
I'm not telling you to do it.

1860
02:20:55.18 --> 02:20:57.58
I'm not telling you to copy what I'm doing.

1861
02:20:57.58 --> 02:20:59.18
Just telling you what I'm doing right now.

1862
02:20:59.18 --> 02:21:00.18
Don't imitate me.

1863
02:21:00.18 --> 02:21:03.18
Find a professional talk about fasting.

1864
02:21:03.18 --> 02:21:04.38
I'm just telling you what I'm doing.

1865
02:21:04.38 --> 02:21:05.78
Jocquat, let me tell you.

1866
02:21:05.78 --> 02:21:06.98
Tastes good.

1867
02:21:06.98 --> 02:21:08.58
Feels good.

1868
02:21:08.58 --> 02:21:14.18
And increases your deadlift about 12 fold.

1869
02:21:14.18 --> 02:21:14.98
Or so.

1870
02:21:14.98 --> 02:21:14.98
Yeah.

1871
02:21:14.98 --> 02:21:16.78
So that's real good for you.

1872
02:21:16.78 --> 02:21:17.98
You can get it on Amazon.

1873
02:21:17.98 --> 02:21:22.58
Also on Amazon, you can get some books, extreme ownership, combat leadership.

1874
02:21:22.58 --> 02:21:25.98
I appreciate everyone that gets it for themselves and then gets it for their teams and

1875
02:21:25.98 --> 02:21:30.98
sends pictures of 47 extreme ownership copies stacked up.

1876
02:21:30.98 --> 02:21:32.98
I got something else for you.

1877
02:21:32.98 --> 02:21:33.98
That's awesome.

1878
02:21:33.98 --> 02:21:36.58
Get it for your business associates.

1879
02:21:36.58 --> 02:21:40.18
People that you work with, but they're not in your company.

1880
02:21:40.18 --> 02:21:43.18
You get it for them and that's going to improve everything in your world too because then

1881
02:21:43.18 --> 02:21:45.58
they start taking ownership or problems and everything gets better.

1882
02:21:45.58 --> 02:21:49.98
So I've had a lot of people that have said, hey, I gave this to this person.

1883
02:21:49.98 --> 02:21:53.46
I gave this to this partner that I used to have and now he's got his own business,

1884
02:21:53.46 --> 02:21:58.06
but we're working together and I gave him the book and now we're working together even more.

1885
02:21:58.06 --> 02:21:59.66
So there's a good idea for you.

1886
02:21:59.66 --> 02:22:00.66
Way of the warrior kid.

1887
02:22:00.66 --> 02:22:02.06
This is awesome at the origin camp.

1888
02:22:02.06 --> 02:22:09.66
A bunch of people from all over the Northeast brought their kids up to meet and

1889
02:22:09.66 --> 02:22:12.26
out, get a signature and all that.

1890
02:22:12.26 --> 02:22:13.26
And what's cool.

1891
02:22:13.26 --> 02:22:14.26
This is what's cool.

1892
02:22:14.26 --> 02:22:15.26
Kids tell the truth.

1893
02:22:15.26 --> 02:22:16.26
You know what I mean?

1894
02:22:16.26 --> 02:22:19.86
They don't even, they're not aware of, they don't care about your feelings at all.

1895
02:22:19.86 --> 02:22:20.86
Yeah.

1896
02:22:20.86 --> 02:22:25.06
And it's awesome that you know, say, I always say to kiddo, did you read that book?

1897
02:22:25.06 --> 02:22:28.06
And they go, yes, how'd you like it?

1898
02:22:28.06 --> 02:22:30.06
And they all say, I love it.

1899
02:22:30.06 --> 02:22:31.06
It's awesome.

1900
02:22:31.06 --> 02:22:32.86
And we know your jacco.

1901
02:22:32.86 --> 02:22:35.26
And thank you for writing it.

1902
02:22:35.26 --> 02:22:41.26
And those kids are getting stronger and smarter and tougher and better.

1903
02:22:41.26 --> 02:22:46.26
So you want to help out kids that you know, get them this book right here.

1904
02:22:46.26 --> 02:22:47.66
This planet was freedom.

1905
02:22:47.66 --> 02:22:49.66
Field manual.

1906
02:22:49.66 --> 02:22:50.66
That's what it is.

1907
02:22:50.66 --> 02:22:54.02
Field manual for those of you that don't know what a field manual is and the military

1908
02:22:54.02 --> 02:22:58.26
a field manual is the instructions on how to do something in the field.

1909
02:22:58.26 --> 02:23:04.34
Whether it's attack a strong objective or whether it's dual reconnaissance or how to conduct

1910
02:23:04.34 --> 02:23:05.34
a patrol.

1911
02:23:05.34 --> 02:23:08.66
The field manual gives you the instructions on how to do that.

1912
02:23:08.66 --> 02:23:09.78
And that's what this is.

1913
02:23:09.78 --> 02:23:11.26
The discipline equals freedom.

1914
02:23:11.26 --> 02:23:16.34
Field manual is a field manual on how to implement discipline into your life.

1915
02:23:16.34 --> 02:23:19.18
There's zero amount of fluff in here.

1916
02:23:19.18 --> 02:23:20.18
There's zero.

1917
02:23:20.18 --> 02:23:24.38
There's nothing in there that you're going to say to yourself, well, I think jacco might

1918
02:23:24.38 --> 02:23:28.02
have just thrown this in here for, you know, kind of take up some space in the pages.

1919
02:23:28.02 --> 02:23:29.02
Didn't happen.

1920
02:23:29.02 --> 02:23:30.54
Rather not do it.

1921
02:23:30.54 --> 02:23:32.22
Rather burn the whole book.

1922
02:23:32.22 --> 02:23:34.14
Don't care about that.

1923
02:23:34.14 --> 02:23:35.14
Books not long enough.

1924
02:23:35.14 --> 02:23:36.14
Cool.

1925
02:23:36.14 --> 02:23:37.34
Read less.

1926
02:23:37.34 --> 02:23:40.42
So that's what it is.

1927
02:23:40.42 --> 02:23:42.58
Get it from your local bookstore.

1928
02:23:42.58 --> 02:23:47.78
So go down to the neighborhood bookstore and tell them you want this book or you can get it

1929
02:23:47.78 --> 02:23:51.46
from Barnes and Noble, you can get it from Amazon.

1930
02:23:51.46 --> 02:23:54.58
Let them know what's up.

1931
02:23:54.58 --> 02:23:58.30
It's in the get after it's section of your local bookstore.

1932
02:23:58.30 --> 02:24:02.18
If they have one, if they don't have that section, they need it so they can put this one

1933
02:24:02.18 --> 02:24:06.50
book by itself in there, getting after it.

1934
02:24:06.50 --> 02:24:07.22
Your video is awesome.

1935
02:24:07.22 --> 02:24:09.14
By the way, thanks, John.

1936

shalomfront.com.

1940
02:24:28.78 --> 02:24:32.70
Finally, the muster September 14th and 15th, I'm pretty sure it's sold out by the time

1941
02:24:32.70 --> 02:24:35.26
this podcast comes out.

1942
02:24:35.26 --> 02:24:37.26
We've been able to squeeze a couple more people in it.

1943
02:24:37.26 --> 02:24:40.46
Each of these even when we're sold out, we got in like four more people, three more

1944
02:24:40.46 --> 02:24:43.34
people, seven more people.

1945
02:24:43.34 --> 02:24:47.46
Check, it might be completely sold out, but extreme ownership.com.

1946
02:24:47.46 --> 02:24:54.22
And if you want to, we're going to pretty soon get the dates for the 2018 musters going.

1947
02:24:54.22 --> 02:25:00.86
So start looking to that and get registered as early as you can.

1948
02:25:00.86 --> 02:25:09.06
And until the muster, if you happen to want to keep cruising with us, kind of hard, we

1949
02:25:09.06 --> 02:25:20.94
are on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and Thishipoha Echo is at Echo Charles and

1950
02:25:20.94 --> 02:25:31.02
I am at Jocca Willink and finally to the military members out there, sitting on some

1951
02:25:31.02 --> 02:25:42.06
forgotten barricade holding the line to protect us, thank you to the vets that stood on the

1952
02:25:42.06 --> 02:25:45.78
wall and did their time.

1953
02:25:45.78 --> 02:25:55.58
Thank you to the police law enforcement, firefighters, EMTs, other first responders.

1954
02:25:55.58 --> 02:26:02.26
Thank you for what you do day in and day out.

1955
02:26:02.26 --> 02:26:17.02
And to the rest of you with goals and dreams and aspiration, make sure you remember that

1956
02:26:17.02 --> 02:26:27.94
seconds turn into minutes, minutes turn into days and days turn into years.

1957
02:26:27.94 --> 02:26:32.06
So make those seconds count.

1958
02:26:32.06 --> 02:26:33.58
All of them.

1959
02:26:33.58 --> 02:26:44.22
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.

1960
02:26:44.22 --> 02:27:10.70
Time to teach.
