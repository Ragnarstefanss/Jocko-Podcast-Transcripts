because and I had these with multiple of sexes like I don't know what it is about regimental commanders but they they just felt like they could talk to me like like I was a piece of shit and I just got to a place in my life in my career I just wouldn't be talked to like that and so it created this unhealthy tension and then when I would push back on some of these conversations you would think that after like a couple days it would actually be like a steam release but it almost like it almost was like seen as a threat and it would almost increase the pressure where then they would come back and want to like reassert dominance which would then want to cause me to like reassert like fuck you so but the regimental opso job just to pan picture going into the story we're about to tell I mean it was the Marseille job was awesome fulfilling manageable hours good work the regimental opso job was like 20 hour days we spent two months at an ITX which is in the Mojave Desert where it is just expected that like I don't eat I have tobacco and I just drink energy drinks like it's almost like I'm looked down upon if that's not how I conduct myself and it just it took a lot out of me and my boss was not very appreciative most of the time and I got into some like this was kind of at the point of my career where I started really pushing back so like as a as a first lieutenant as a exo and a body with my batani commander was kind of verbally and even at times physically abusive like just kind of took it and in my head was like this is wrong like we talk about china and the fact that they banned parts of the internet and social media they you are not allowed and here it is happening here in america all the enough what is the what do you think is like the above board not even above board what what is the motive you think and banning someone driving a narrative i feel i'm sorry man i feel like someone who's it response i mean i'm sure this is a group people who are responsible for that and they're kind of running the banning but what is it like what is the conclusion that they come to the be like you know what we should really just ban this is just driving a narrative they're driving a narrative and here there's there's what sucks is the worst thing you can do to try and drive a narrative is not let people talk because if someone has a dumb idea the best thing you could do is let them talk about their dumb idea so we can say hey here's your why your idea is dumb what's scariest when we let ego get involved and instead of me saying you know what echo's got a opinion i'm not sure if he's right or but like I feel like a taller organization would have been like hey we're gonna let investigation play out we're gonna let you sit and calm down obviously this is personal but you've broken some rules and what's left the investigation play out and we'll see where the chips fall like that's the reason but they they obviously fired me within like 12 hours were you surprised when you got relieved I was surprised I didn't learn investigation take place I really was it did not I didn't expect that like when I was calculating what would happen I thought I might be benched while on investigation took place and I had even talked to my battalion exo for like 20 minutes like I was texting my friends and I was like if the Marine Corps was really trying to find me like they didn't think to text me they didn't think to call me and so like potentially potentially the public affairs office arm just wasn't talking to like whoever should have been calling me and just got out ahead of it first and so then it came back to like what do I want to do like if if none of them care about me do I want to limp towards the retirement for the next three years because that's best case and I just came to the decision like no I can't live my life like that like this was never supposed to be a career this was always supposed to be something that was fulfilling I don't care about the money as much as other people might I really don't like I'll be fine no I'm gonna poke you in the chest because what you did was broke the rules and then I'm like well no come back and listen to what I'm saying like no you're still breaking the rules I'm gonna make it worse for you and so like each one of these is just an example of like if you think cared about me they would have called one thing that I noticed and I heard you talking about it you know at the end of that second video you're getting emotional and you're like asking for accountability and then kind of ranting against everything a little bit so when I was at SOS a captain the lieutenant Colonel was my battalion commander that he did a lot for me he retired as at O6 he had gotten on my social media and said if Stuart's other was honorable he would resign he didn't state that he was my previous boss or that he was like a mentor to me he didn't email me he didn't text me and I felt like I mean that really was like a stab in the back to me because a lot of general officers that are on LinkedIn that they gave preferred LinkedIn not Facebook so that's why I had a LinkedIn too a lot of the senior officers knew who he was and so for him to call me out like that and so I'm struggling with when I'm with my kid on the boat I'm struggling with they relieved me without even an investigation like I knew my job as it risk when I posted that video but like no one reads the follow up you know what I mean you get that one shot that's right especially when it comes to like a viable type videos that are gonna get out there no one's fault no one's following up with that you get home from that video and your life is like you didn't pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-re-re-re-re-wife now your life is just like no this isn't gonna happen that's right well it depends on what kind but uh butter there's a lot of butter in it butter sugar flavoring there's like a flavoring of some sort um like chocolate frosting this is butter sugar and chocolate and like cream I think that's pretty much it that's part of like there's a lot of fake part I don't like that's why cupcakes not really my thing bro I make exact opposite but like again I'm having all these indicators so this like this escalating thing of like me feeling like what I said is right all right you should show some sympathy and they're like but the the cold shower you know how they say one of the benefits is like it exercises your mind to do something you really don't want to do so that way like mentally everything else seems like I don't know easier or whatever um I guess even though you really don't that's not the first thing you want to do going a cold shower or cold tub when you wake up usually but when you get out you do feel like dang oh your entire career we'd been at war you know I spent more than half my career we weren't at war you know we were in the 90s the dry years but I'm thinking man this guy's been in the Marine Corps for 17 years the Marine Corps and America's been at war for that entire time you as you mentioned you said you know you got a lot to lose you know what could happen you knew you were risking your baton command you know family stability the whole nine yards you bring up that letter from the commandant that he wrote and you know you mentioned did anyone throw their rank on the table and say we shouldn't give a boggerman which again you know going back to the the silent five which is what McMaster called the the Joint Chiefs of Staff that work for LBJ and you can even hear you know that I've read in the beginning of guys that reflected back and said I should have said something I should have stood up you talk about the fact that the people that died dying in vain if we don't you you say you said if we don't own up and say we did not do this well in the end but like I said some like hard stuff to hear it wasn't very like it wasn't like a uniting message it was just like a fuck you to everyone and again I even put in the post I'm ready to go to jail yeah right on Stu you got any closing thoughts before you shut it down now I'll just echo to your audience as I watched my saga unfold in the media the mainstream media is so polarized right now it was very hard to get a true assessment of like how people even felt watching the news because you know most of the people were taking my statements and trying to fit them into whatever their narrative was and shows like yours podcasts like yours YouTube channels I was actually getting much more accurate feedback from what people thought than mainstream media and I felt the way to do that was through what I wanted to be just the one video like I did not plan it to be anything other than that I thought I'll make one video I'll explain some of the things that I think they should have done and I'm going to demand accountability because that's what I think we deserve because we're missing it and so that was what led to that first video and even after I made it like I I articulate in that first video that I knew I was potentially going to lose my job my retirement my family stability like obviously I had thought through that articulated it in the video and even after I made the video I didn't post it right away right so for all those reasons again I made more sense to plead guilty and that so that was kind of it almost anti-climactic a little bit you you I'll tell you though there was some drama and so like I said the fastest court martial from exit of jail and agreement in the history of the Marine Corps also one of those charges like 88 I think I was the first officer charge since Vietnam like they were just like throwing stuff on the wall and I'm like quickly answering him while trying to do all these different things and there was just like one situation where he snapped started screaming for an everyone and I looked at him and that was a situation like here time I'm going to move around for a while I didn't say anything I just walked out this is like I'm we're gonna fight so I walked out So as a batank manager I was always the first one in the office and it just so happened that that day my wife had a medical appointment and I had agreed to drop the kids off at like at school it's called a-to-clock and so it was like an abnormal occurrence so that's like the one day I didn't show up early and so I take the kids and so now I don't get into work until like 18 and as a batank manager you don't tell people when you're coming in you just show up at a normal time but I had texted my option accidentally I came around late and like you know you gotta understand like how scary it is to do something like that because I essentially said my career's over in Panera but I wanted North Carolina and so then he called me back and said this is what he said he said I got your email I'm gonna give you exactly what you want and I went to his house for dinner to his previous with our families to hang out and like when I was in that motel we're like you know I had no other like can scattered my life's falling apart like I could probably really could have used a friend alright it's anything we can talk about like why you doing this he then screenshot it those and brought them to the investigating officer unsolicited to say look I was trying to figure out what his motives are like he this stew sheller is just a fucking a ferries character she'd never been a batile in command you're like who does that like what man does that blood in the water there's blood in the water man sharks are going to pounce so I was like it looks so cool to see that last page posted because the way it's laid out and stuff um final spin check that out leadership strategy and tactics field man or

active retire their families go to our families check out mark least but they released the command investigation with all those like it's just crazy things that those officer said to the media with my medical investigation so that selective articles could be written about like how I was a violent extremist and it was just blatantly false stuff like I'm still on the fence of whether I should sue for libel or just like move forward but so once they leaked at that investigation your point the judge the judge was like if that's true like this is criminal like those people should be brought to the court not Lieutenant Colonel Scheller and so the Marine Corps was like forced to do another command investigation on the leaked command investigation so they did another command investigation so you end up going up trial and this trial the judge you said looked at your record and was like hey well where did this come from the judge I don't think one of me to plead guilty so it wasn't you know all those charges you read off and there's like all these findings of facts the only choice there's only one choice except guilty for all of them at special court martial or plead not guilty to all of them the general like so to give in the weeds about what any of them said it was almost irrelevant and so so if you did not not not guilty what would happen how to go to general court martial and so that's when I made that fourth video in my Charlie's like general McKenzie is like I can't think in military history where someone is so obviously culpable like it's just clear like the Emperor has no clothes you have to see it I mean I've got a couple stories where like I basically tried to throw my career away a couple times because I was like this is important to me like this is important to me and you know you can think about what you want and like I talked to some of my guys after he did it in front of everyone and go my guys were like I can't believe you didn't hit him like I can't believe you had the balls to just walk away like I wouldn't have done that so there were times I think from like 30 years ago what they have now is you know world's better and don't what we used to have like they have small groups they facilitate good discussions they really challenged my thinking on the wars I mean we went back it's like Frederick the Great and Prussia all the way through Napoleon and Civil War and modern day yeah album one this album you talk about it does have tracks on it each track is literally the solution for any moment of weakness you might have the common ones apparently I need to make one for cupcakes well because you got to have much by a cupcake but it was that was like it was like too fast for me to be like oh let me pop in trick and psychological warfare I don't even think I have my phone you got and so I tell you that just to say my CEO had stopped by my office and called like three times and my upso called me and was like hey sir, CEO was really looking for aish probably calm and so when I drove in I got in I think I like eight thirty that morning, CEO was actually walking because his buildings let's say a two minute walk from my building he was actually walking between the buildings and I saw him Like up to like my senior and list of like every single one like I was bringing in chaplains. but like you said it's only been like one week since close to Christmas they've been back so who knows what about your friends in the marine core what do they say nothing I mean the the the lieutenant kernels that were closest to me in the investigation that I've made I've counted a couple interviews and just illustrated what they said they've obviously gone calm silently all these other guys that I know have come online and been like that's bullshit that they did that I'm I constantly say to clients and people and friends we don't make good decisions or an or emotional like don't try it this started as a joke when I was a young and listed guy like we would go out drinking and make decisions you know and if the joke was hey don't make decisions don't make life changes I would volunteer for cartoons and do stuff like that oh so I totally did totally did I was doing something in the kitchen and there was like a container in the leftovers you know how people when you're younger you're like gonna go out with your friends drinking and you do like all we're gonna pre-game ever heard of that and I was like all right I was like I don't know if I can do a tonight I've just been fired why don't we you know give me the night and so went to bed I was the last night actually slept with my wife that night slept with my something the same bed with my wife got up the next morning I got the three boys in the couch so like maybe you should just chill and get some sleep and that was his way of saying like maybe he went too far like trying to offer me some sleep and of course I'm just stubborn I might know I don't need sleep I'm just fine and so you just gotta understand that like that's what I came out of after a year of just being overworked to like almost like fist fighting a couple times and then going into my batank of energy so you you're you're having clashes with regimental commander
