 This is jockel podcast number 301 with echo Charles and me jockel wink good evening echo good evening How did I end up here? I'm smart I'm funny. I look pretty damn handsome if I do say so myself But here I am nowhere And it seems this is where I will always be nowhere Bedroom It is not an apartment, but it looks like one cheap furniture will used carpet not clean but not dirty The bedroom is not unique in its wares bed desk chair dresser Small bedside table with lamp over headlight Janky ceiling fan spinning at a low speed Then there is the day core Pictures hung neatly on the walls They are strange Or at least indicate a strangeness that is hard to interpret harmless but different Johnny walks in 20 something leaning towards 20 Pretty damn handsome from unkempt young man who stays up to late and eats the wrong foods and drinks more beer and whiskey than he should He looks at his brother Johnny is frustrated He tries to remain restrained but it can be hard after all these years What the hell cleaner man? I told you about these shirts Arty looks distraught Johnny sees Johnny cannot stay frustrated After all This is Arty his brother And no one could really be mad at Arty What? Is it not clean? Arty replies Honestly concerned Wondering if he had somehow failed his brother No Arty It isn't that it is not clean It's clean But it's just a t-shirt I know Arty cuts in It's 100% cotton t-shirt I used a warm warm cycle It shouldn't have shrunk at all I'm always careful about that The wrong Arty that's not it It's just Never mind Forget it What's wrong This was killing Arty The one thing he was supposed to be good at And it seemed like he messed it up Arty Johnny replied As kindly as he could It's just that it's a t-shirt You don't press t-shirts You don't put starch in t-shirts Buddy But the creases are sharp Aren't they? Arty replies Wondering what on earth The problem could be The creases are sharp Johnny concedes But that's not the point You don't put military creases in t-shirts I've told you this before Arty But why? Cotton holds the starch really Well Johnny starts to get frustrated again He's been down this road before Many times Look cleaner I know that you always tell me that And I always tell you You just don't start your press t-shirts Because You just don't do it Mom likes hers Pressed Johnny lets out a sigh Arty realizes he's gone too far Listen, Arty, I get it But I'm not mom And I don't want my t-shirts I'm not a star, it's a black Sabbath t-shirt I just wear it out with a pair of jeans Okay, can you just give me Give them a simple, wash and dry From now on, please Low heat tumble dry Arty asks Wanting to get a good procedure Lockdown Johnny smiles Yeah, Arty I think that would be perfect Thanks bud I can do it now Arty offers I gotta go Okay, it won't happen again Johnny Thanks Arty Johnny said with a smile And Johnny? Arty asks What? I'm sorry It's okay bud It's okay Johnny feels a little bad as Arty walks away They are brothers They even look a little like It isn't too much of a stretch to see the similar jeans Dark hair Blue eyes Pernounced eyebrows But that is where the similarities end After all, Arty is different A little pludgy Glasses It is possible to tell from looking at his face That something isn't quite right There are medical names that could be assigned But most of those wouldn't quite hit the mark He's older than Johnny by six years But his peculiarities keep him living at home Johnny on the other hand doesn't have an excuse to still be living at home Other than Arty and his mom They both need him around That's where he tells himself anyway Johnny's bedroom is the same room he has always had Matches on the floor, no box spring, no bed frame Postures of rock bands on the wall from when he was younger Black Sabbath, motor head Led Zeppelin, ACDC Some muscle cars too He hadn't bothered to take them down as he outgrew them He also hadn't bothered to clean his room very often Close remnants of food and beer cans on the floor This was all a stark contrast to Arty's room Critically clean with the bed tightly made And then there are the walls of Arty's room in their curious day core The walls neatly display pictures of clothes, washing machines and dryers There are brochures about various lines of laundry equipment on his little desk Some of the more colorful ones are also hanging on the wall There are also coupons for laundry detergents, fabric softens And stain removal products on the desk in an envelope The source of his nickname, Cleaner Is no mystery at all Arty likes to clean Laundry To be exact That right there is the opening To a new book A new book called Final Spin Which was written by me And it is a novel I guess that's what it says in the cover But it's also kind of a poem It's also kind of a manuscript I don't really know 100% What to call it but it's not normal in the way that it is written And so as far as the storyline goes It's, I was thinking about this I think it's a little bit of an alternate autobiography of source of your very alternate history books So it's where they take some event in the past and they change it What if the Nazis won? What if the south won the civil war? They call them alternate history books So it's kind of thinking this is almost like an alternate biography in a way Maybe not specifically but maybe some of my friends Some of the experiences we had Maybe my life if I'd taken some different turns along the way Well I didn't know this guy's name is Johnny The guy's name is Johnny Yeah but then there's like you're going to see as we talk through this I'm composite characters and it's almost like everyone's a composite character What do you mean composite? Meaning different people from my past kind of A symbol together Maybe two people that acted a certain way Well one characteristic from someone Maybe a little bit of a characteristic from me So that was kind of the starting point These kind of humans and you put them in this situation So what does the book about? Let me, I'm going to start off by reading a review of the book The first review to come out about the book And this review came from Something called Publishers Weekly Which is a publishing trade magazine that's been around since 1872 And the subtitle of this thing is the international news magazine of book publishing in book selling This is the heavy hitter of this industry Since the 1940s the book review section Is sort of become the center of the magazine in the online website And it carries a lot of weight And truly ultimately determines a lot of what you read Depending on how it does and how this publication talks about it What's interesting is the reviews in publishers weekly are anonymous They're short They're blunt And oftentimes to the point of being brutal You can see that the people that write them Can be harsh and very usually crafty writers So they're harsh in a pretty savage way I was reading a little bit about it one author said A negative review is never pleasant But publishers weekly reviews have a particularly heart-stopping quality And this guy wrote a piece I didn't write down his name but it was how he got a bad review And just what it felt like Now as I said this book is different It's not a normal book It's hard to classify the form that I wrote it in And I've written a bunch of other books before Some best selling books in New York Times best selling books But here's the thing those books were of a different genre Right And that means a lot in this world In the publishing world and the literature world I've written a bunch of these non-fiction adult books That's what I've written And I've written children's fiction books Right but neither of those are fiction adult books So it's like saying I played professional football So I can play professional baseball too It's sort of like saying that Which we know Doesn't really work that way And most people can't handle that transition And don't handle that transition So going into this going into writing the novel Right I got warned I've ever talked about this? Probably I got warned by my publisher By my I got warned by my editor I got warned by my agent They were They were I think Little bit trying to talk me out of it Little bit trying to talk me out of it They're saying it's a different world And they don't care what you've done before And they might they might actually hold your other books against you They kind of say that kind of Right And you should just maybe stay in your lane Which by the way I got that about my kids books too But This story Is one of the stories that's in my head And I got a lot of stories in my head And this was the one that bubbled the surface that needed to get out So I got it out And this is what publishers weekly had to say So here we go From the critics Final spin a novel by Jaka Willing Former Navy SEAL and Children's Book author Willink Way of the Warrior Kids series Marks is adult fiction debut With the downbeat and gripping story of a group of characters Abandoned by the American Dream At age 23 Johnny cares for his alcoholic mother And mentally challenged brother Arty While holding down a dead end job as a stockboy At a big box store Arty is obsessed with clean clothes And when the laundromat where he works is slated to be sold Johnny decides to buy the business in order to keep Arty employed To come up with the $40,000 he needs Johnny and his best friend go Decide to rob the safe at their store Hand off the money to the owner Then high tail at Tomexica They get the money But the getaway scheme is flawed from the start And Johnny and Goat quickly Have the state police on their trail To make matters worse Johnny is forced to say goodbye to his girlfriend Jessica Who has just found out she is pregnant Willing tells his story in quick blasts of high coup like writing And they give the example here Johnny on the customers at his workplace They call people Flesh covered robot beings in need of fuel and meaning They find both here and quote With dialogue reminiscent of early David Mehmet Told with a gritty simplicity This retains a hold on the reader right through to the inevitable tragic climax So that's the plot of the book And that's the impression that they got at publishers weekly Which was really an awesome review I was definitely very stoked to read that As was my literary age and as was my publisher as was my editor Everyone thinks you're all in the dice Everyone's nervous They're scared Yeah, you kind of are rolling the dice But the nature of dice is you win and you lose Yeah, you know a lot of times what people worried about is the losing part Yeah, but there is the winning part Yeah, now so they compare me they compare the The Writing or at least the dialogue to yeah the dialogue and I want to give myself too much credit here But they compare the dialogue to David Mehmet Mehmet Who is Well straight up he's a Pulitzer Prize winning freaking author He's a playwright he's a film director director screenwriter he's written all kinds of stuff You've heard a Glenn Gary Glenn Ross. Yes, sir. Yep. He wrote that. Yeah, coffees for clothes Always be closing speed the plow he wrote the screenplay for the postman Always ring twice Little Jack Nicholson The verdict the untouchable's hoffa wag the dog Hannibal He wrote and directed things changed homicide Olianna the wins low boy Staten main Spartan just a bunch of stuff what I'm saying is that this guy's a highly respected and a Completter definitely I was Very pleasantly surprised and humbled to be compared to him in any way, so we were off to a strong start We're feeling good about it so far. Much appreciated Because this is a different world So It's interesting appreciate yeah people if you if you want to get the book that will be awesome And it's not a complete dud. We'll say that So now this is an interesting we're gonna get into the book a little bit Which is gonna be a little bit tricky because I don't want our ruin the story story spoiler spoiler alert So I'm gonna keep it A little bit focused on not going too much into it, but at the same time getting into the characters a little bit so The characters Let's start with this guy, Arty So we got this guy Arty who You already heard about he's got some kind of mental challenges which I don't name in the book and the reason I didn't name him in the book is because A lot of times I've met people in my life where I know that they have some kind of mental challenge, but I don't know what it is. I'm not a doctor. There's no they're not wearing a label on their hat that says whatever mental challenge they've got And so I didn't want a label you know I didn't want to throw a label on there. This is the particular Situation that this person's in and the other thing is I you know people have such a wide variety of mental challenges that You don't know what you're gonna get So Where did this character came from? Well, this is a very direct story. I worked at Wendy's Yeah, I don't know if that I don't know if that weren't the hell yeah, but I worked at Wendy's And when I worked at Wendy's you've been Wendy's before right, which let's face it kind of props to Wendy's Wendy's Wendy's when he serves it up and I used to I used to get my child on at Wendy's when I was a teenager Well, at this Wendy's when I worked there was there was a salad bar you know they have a salad bar at Wendy's I don't know they still have salad bar Wendy's not that I know of oh, I don't know so back in the day Back in the day they had a salad bar at Wendy's and the person that ran the salad bar That took care of the salad bar that we supplied the Peach slices and the Caesar salad dressing was this woman who clearly had she was probably I'm gonna say 55 maybe 60 years old so older woman thin Short hair her name was a gene and She obviously had you know so it seemed like some kind of perhaps autism But again, I don't know. She's not wearing a label But she was super into the salad bar She was probably the best one of the best employees ever she loved this salad bar. She wanted to be squared away She was out there with a washcloth wiping up if anybody if you spilled a drop of salad dressing on your on your maneuver from the Spoon to the plate she was honest she was standing by with a rag She was gonna wipe that up like almost bumping into you, but she also knew that that wasn't correct She'd give you you know three quarters of a second to take one step towards the croutons and she was in there Getting on it So she's there and she's working and she loved it. I mean like she was obsessed with it and no one would talk to her Right everyone was kind of mean to her right because you could make fun of her and she was an easy target And I was cool to you know, I'd always say hi, hi, Jean I know you know trying to talk to her a little bit and every time I would start a conversation with her Hey, Jean how are you you know, hey, Jean how's it going today and she'd be like I just opened up a new can of of Of of Coutons in the bar new a new can of sliced peaches. They're gonna be so good I'd be awesome You know and I'd say oh, you know, it's here like lunch break Hey Jean are you gonna take a lunch break? Yeah, but first I'm gonna get more sliced onions out here and Have you seen the onions there so fresh she just fired up to the point where I was torn between thinking if it was Unabusive situation where she was being taken advantage of to where The others like complete opposite was she just What are they so well she's so lucky to be there and happy that they hired her and like here she was with this job So that was one part of it the other part of it that struck me that stuck with me for my whole life Is that she was Happy right so here I am this young freaking punk ass kid and I'm there with other Punk ass kids that are working at Wendy's and everyone's kind of miserable Right, did you ever work at a fast food joint? Do you ever work at a restaurant? I did not work at a restaurant The bar nightclub's closest but even being a bouncer in a bar nightclub is not That's let's face it that's like a little bit kind of cool. Yeah a little bit right you have a little Pows also a bar back it one point at other clubs and get tender so it's it's service It's different you're good. It's different it's a little bit cool Yes, to be a bouncer at a club. Yes, sir, right I mean that can be a definitely a cool job It's not cool to work at Wendy's Run in the grill running the salvage bar. You're not happy about it. There's no benefits Zero you know you other than you're getting paid money, which is kind of cool So what struck me what I was remembered is we're all kind of miserable even if this is what I also remember like the the general manager And I forget to remember his name But he was like work he was one of those guys. It was just a work working, you know working Just always pissed off about something like hey, what you know always mad so even the own I mean he was I don't He's the owner around the because the owner, but he's definitely the general manager He might have even been the franchise owner or something but he's using there all the time But you know he had to be making Legitum at money because when you when you're a general manager one of those you're making good money, but he was freaking miserable Something to myself everyone here is miss every single person here 100 I mean the how many employees that they probably have Probably a total of 35 to 40 employees, you know day shift night shift You know everyone Everyone's part time, you know, so no one's really working so there's like probably 40 employees there total And every single one of us was miserable and Hated life Except for Jean and she was smiling and she was into it and she was amped so I took that idea and The reason I ended up with laundry is because I worked at or the where place where I used to go to the laundry mat in San Diego Had this the people at own the laundry mat the the they were from Asia and The wife didn't speak English, but the husband would be kind of be there, but the the the wife didn't speak English But she'd come out and talk to me In I don't even know where she was from but she would talk to me and smile and laugh and make jokes Not in English, not in English, but they were funny I mean I They were so funny that I did laugh I would laugh. I would do my wife. I would laugh and whatnot even know what it was about You know she might point it like you know a pile of clothes and say something In whatever language you were so I could do it didn't just start laughing if my wife were just laugh It had to be pretty funny for her to get that but joy on it, right? So I don't know that I landed on laundry So there we go there we get already that kind of wraps up this guy already as a character where he came from so now we get this other character Johnny Which as you said, yeah, it's my guess my My real first name is John so do we get the Johnny from that kind of but I don't know I maybe just the generic of Of the name Johnny more than anything else, but but probably the strongest Influence on this character is a kid that I grew up with a kid named Jeff Lang who I've talked about on this on the spotcast before So Jeff Lang was like my best friend From maybe Third grade Maybe second no probably second second first or second grade until seventh grade and in fifth grade when we we were in the same classroom together all day Because that's before you start going to different classes, right? So fifth grade we were in the same class, you know sitting next to each other and we were we were Trouble makers right just always getting in trouble always causing problems always you know laughing when we shouldn't be laughing Just doing stuff that we shouldn't have been doing But he was always a little bit more He had a little bit he had a little bit less obedience in him. I didn't have much He had even less obedience in him so like at that point when the teacher would Threaten or you you'd be quieter you're going to the office That was he could I got checked by that Jeff wouldn't get checked by that he connects level gets sent to the office, right? So he had a little bit extra and he was super funny I mean hilarious, you know kind of an athletic stud Which what does that mean that means when you're in fifth grade you kind of kick acid dodge ball right click kick ball and he's really good in run So yeah, just fast and all that stuff just a good at really good athlete better than me funnier than me Tall you know just just a good He was just kind of like a little bit better than me and everything and he also had a little bit of extra rebelliousness So As we got older I started kind of we we started started to deviate in our lives together You know we were we were still always friends but he started like Drinking started doing drugs started listening to I guess he went down like the kind of hippie music drugs that kind of thing and I was going into the hardcore music and more like the straight edge thing and so our paths really kind of deviate it But we were still friends because we were such good friends for so long that it doesn't matter what he's doing and what I'm doing We're still friends we just have this you know huge common connection and as we got so so as we got older He went really you know, I don't even know if he I don't even remember if he graduated high school Because he went hard you know doing drugs and drinking and just doing that whole thing And not not a bad person that's just what he was doing and still I'd see him see him in town We you know we'd always connect we'd always just had that friendship and I remember I joined the military during the Navy And you know small town and he kind of knew He'd heard what was going on and then I saw And I remember he said something to me Because you know when we were little kids we would play army all the time right when you're look when you're Seven years old ten years old 12 years old and you live in the woods you're playing army Right you're putting your burn in a cork and putting make your face black and put in camo on and Shoot and be guns at each other. That's what we did. We put you be be guns at each other and Every time you got hit you had to take a layer of clothing off And I remember the red rider it makes a little boom when it it's like This it's spring active. Oh yeah, and because you know we try and put limits on the number of pumps You could put on the pump backs right and but I remember the red rider because you you could hear it boom And then you hit you So so you know he was into the same kind of stuff. I was and then as we got older we deviated So I see him the last time I see him before I leave for the Navy he's You know clearly Not on a great path And he said something to me along the lines of He said yeah, you're doing the Navy I said yeah And I'm even remember if we if he knew what a seal was I think he kind of did The only I kind of did it that time you know new too much about it But he's I'm gonna reset something like hey, I wish I could go with you and I was like you can't bro, let's go And I could see like maybe that could And he said I can't he's I can't I can't Something like I can't anymore like he had knew he was kind of too far gone To correct the path that he was on So I end up going the Navy and I was going through seal training and I was Probably around Just before hell week maybe just after a week I forget but I called my parents to check in I talked to my mom And I found out that Jeff had killed himself and he had he had broken up with his girlfriend at the time and he'd killed himself And that was you know just just a Very sad Because well, I think what made it the most sad to me was that he had gone down this path And he had way more potential than I had as a human and and It was all gone And that was really sad and then when when I looked him up, you know, this is when the last time I recorded I talked about him on this podcast for a couple of years ago I had googled him just googled his name which you can google people from you know 1745 and there's some record and there's some Genealogy report about who they were and you google someone from 1942 and there's you know an obituary about who they were and I googled his name and There was like nothing nothing Which is just Carb because he was freaking hilarious smart on a just an awesome guy And and quite I didn't mention this but the book you know the dedication of the book is just says for Jeff Lang So that was sort of A lot of where this character Johnny came from somebody with kind of potential and Just Stuck made bad choices Maybe not bad choices but different choices maybe had some bad luck thrown in there Live this life So that's Johnny you hear about these too Next up you get a guy named goat who's Johnny's best friend. I'm gonna I'm gonna go to page 7 here in the book Nice shirt man goat says with a smile as he sees Johnny's starched black Sabbath T-shirt It's military creases running from each shoulder down to the waist up yours Johnny replies That cotton really holds the crease doesn't it yeah does Johnny says you couldn't iron them out or anything I tried but damn he uses an industrial press and he looks at me like I'm ripping his heart out what can I say My brother is crazy Yeah, but that son of a bitch can iron some shirts can he he sure is hell can you want another one What time do we have to be at work go to ask Not until 10 30 shit. Let's do this two more Lucy Johnny says to the bar made BB's bar Dingy working class watering hole cheap final seats even cheaper drinks Go is about the same age as Johnny though he looks a little younger His dark skin has an almost childlike texture his black hair looks as if it is always organized Regardless of what he has been doing His eyes are dark and deep He is handsome He too has that look about him that says he shouldn't be here Shouldn't be in a dead end job shouldn't be in a dead end bar shouldn't be in a dead end life But he is So there's go Full name George Martinez That is Johnny's best friend and again This guy is kind of a composite character of Friends that I had grown up the story takes place in southern California So he's a Mexican kid. I grew up with a bunch of white people primarily But when you're out in California you see the there's really no distinction between you know different people um And that's just another kid another kid that has a bunch of potential another kid that's talented another kid that's smart another kid that's handsome And another kid that's kind of stuck in a dead end sense scenario with what I said dead end job dead and bar dead in life right That's where we end up That's where we're at And And Well, we were talking before the podcast about the young I think I think carry was saying you remember what it was like when you were younger and it was just all in kind of like you're just on board Right down for the call it's right down for the cause and that was The characteristic that I kind of tried to throw in here with goat was that characteristic of being down for the cause and what's cool What when you when you talked about Johnny being based on me There's parts definitely elements of me in Johnny for sure, but one of the elements that's that's from me in goat is just down for the cause I've been to stuff that you do in your 16 17 18 and then when I got in the Navy your 19 20 years old guess what oh that's what as you like to say echo That's what we're doing Yep down for the cause. We're down We're ready to go well with that is that what we're doing hey all right once you kind of flip that switch That's why man the young the young men in the world They'll do some crazy shit Sometimes because they're just reddit rock and roll Ready to rock and roll so there's you two main characters and again One of the things one of the immediate feedback points When I submitted the manuscript And Was how about some more character development Right and what I said is you already know these characters We already know these characters. We grew up with these characters everybody knows these people Everybody knows these people we all know them We are them in many ways So I was like what what what what what also I need to tell you What else do I need to tell you you know these people I know these people There's your character development look around You You Started this with Arty Mm-hmm, and that's one of the first things that jumped out of me Or it's like not only do I know who that guy is I've known a guy or girl like that since I was a little kid And it's just he's just there. He's down for his cause some negative some positive some or like Angry at everyone somewhere. It's just happy to see every you know like but but really in it not it kind of in a generic Almost kind of way. I mean it's more particular because because of the book and everything right but you know that guy Totally know that guy that's the first thing that you're telling me for Arty already. Oh, yeah, and how many Arty's have you known about? 12 Yeah, but they fit that in one way or another little different flavor Yeah, yeah, sure, you know, oh man. I could go deep into it too where some people would tease them just like your girl Jean same exact thing And they're everywhere so it's like yeah, you know we all know Arty I think we all know Arty we all know Jean we all know Johnny well know goat These are our people and there's the character development yeah, and look obviously there's more character Velpon that's goes on but you know For me to take the time to explain this this is one thing you're you're gonna notice when you read this book is I'm not I'm trying not to waste any time. Yeah. I'm trying not to waste any words It I'm trying to get you there it get you there get you into this as quick as possible and allow you to To utilize what you already know as a person yeah to to put the context around what's happening Use the schema. I was reading this book and they went deep in the word schema. Yeah That's like you stuff that you already know to describe something new right interesting and you use like You do this in real life too where you use less words than necessary kind of thing and it's weird because it makes you kind of go like Deep in your own head almost when you're like even that one when you're describing you know People you know me however be described in the news just like it's like You didn't do this like the opposite of the the opposite of that is like some grandiose thing where it's like You know one after another the people piled in like this and like that and then this person and it's But note you did the exact opposite but meanwhile you get the same effect but it's more like in your own And like real personal kind of you know there's something I talk about with leadership. It's Minimum force required right I as a leader want to use the minimum force To get you to do what I want you to do yeah to get you to do what we need to do right minimum force required I don't want to say hack or here's what you need to do I might say hack or what you think about doing this and you're like Oh, yeah, that's probably be good right I want to use the minimum force I try and write I try to write this book where the the feeling is there with the minimum amount of words Get the point across with the minimum amount of words It does add drama to it That because even in real life this book aside Like it's more dramatic that way well I also say all the time the less you talk to more people listen Yeah, I give that as leadership counsel hey if you're in there and you got something to say in a meeting and you say it in 14 sentences and it takes you seven minutes Yeah, maybe 14 second maybe maybe maybe it takes you seven minutes to say something That you could have said in 14 seconds the 14 second route was way is way preferred of course and it's gonna have so much more impact Yes, but let's face it the added specifically added drama Is undeniable like so if if we're here. I don't know let's say we had to I don't know make key chains or something and There was like a hundred thousand key chains that needed to be made and we get here five p.m. whatever and I ask you And you're like yeah, we need to get these done or whatever and then I look at them and go hey, are we gonna do all these tonight and and There's two different scenarios where you could be like you know what yeah, we're gonna we're gonna get all these done tonight or you could just look at me I know are the answers fucking yes, yeah, oh, it's hell. He has much way much dramatic Yeah, you don't even say anything say anything right or you could pull which would you typically do you'll just say yes and that's it I want more I want you to make me feel good. I want to but it's just this big black hole of Nothingness that I'm just left with except for yes like with that you you got to make of it Whatever you're gonna make of it, but yes, you know, so it's like how we merge back Good so that's what the book is written like Um I we're gonna roll into don't just trying to give some of the characters right some of the some of the characters here's the I guess this is our leading female character in the book here we go She is a pretty but tough looking girl thick black hair that wants to curl but is for the most part stringed by its own weight and volume pale skin dark eyes eyes with a hint of fight left in them But most of the fight is gone Born away by long hours and hard work and worn away by the reality of life Jessica Where have you been she asks working where else Johnny responds defensively you can't call or anything Sorry he replies. I'm a prick. Yeah, you are she says You never held that against me before don't start now you buy me a drink and I'll forgive you Lucy So-co and coke Johnny shouts to the bar made so-co and coke got it the bartender response How's work Johnny asks although he knows the answer The usual marks an asshole everybody comes into that place is a fucking asshole and I do what I do Smiling kiss their ass. Why don't you quit Johnny asks? It's an earnest question even though the answer is known by him She knows the answer to she also has the same question why don't you quit your fucking job stock boy Ouch Thanks Johnny mutters ejected Well, I mean fuck of course I'd quit that job same as you but who's gonna pay the rent? The bartender approaches them and places the Southern comforting coke in front of Jessica So-co and coke she says matter of fact thanks Lucy Johnny tells her thanks Johnny Jessica says to Johnny Anything for you darling he says with a smile Great your horny she says hey he replies defensively. I'm just don't worry I am too she says with a smile So there's Jessica Again, where does Jessica come from kind of a composite character of Growing up of traveling If we've gone in different towns different cities Restaurants bars, you know, she's a waitress I know many Jessica's in my time and like you said I think we've all known plenty of Jessica's and and look she's hard working She's determined what she's up against the odds And she's also productive and you learn this in the book she's a product of some bad decisions or at least some decisions that aren't great ones Right so she kind of ends up in her stuck in this position as well and and to quote Harvey Kytel From reservoir dogs. Yes, her waitressing is the number one job for female non college graduates in this country And I always I always you know because I worked in restaurants man That's a freaking hard job and you got a smile Right, yeah kind of customer service. It's got a smile So not only are you working a hard job and people are treating you bad in some cases Yeah, where this is in cook good enough By the way if you if you ever are serving me and I return something to kitchen It is totally jacked up because if it's not a totally jacked up. I'm just gonna like just like it I mean you got to give me a raw bleeding piece of meat if you think I'm gonna return to the kitchen What about the wrong thing so you can use you straight up the wrong thing they mess your order up wrong thing is it Some mum down with You know like is it okay isn't like hey, I ordered the rib eye get a piece of primer Go I'll eat it. What if you get a fish Probably going back I'll be cool about it. Yeah, I'll probably just say you know what I might do in that situation. This is how nice I am like it Nice to say yeah, no because I'd probably be like hey, you know, I'm also interested in getting a steak and you bring your rib eye You get both of my things Yeah, maybe maybe put that in a z-o and I dog you bag or something do you uh do you? On the inside do you actually feel bad that you have to do? Yes, you have to you feel bad Yeah, I don't like I don't like I don't like messing with waitresses. I don't like you know anybody in service, right? You know anybody in service. I don't like being that guy. Yeah, the the proverbial guy, right? That's like Yeah, man. Can you hurry up with that? Yeah, you know I'm the guy that be like a you know I guess I guess I'm not drinking water and I haven't seen a long run awhile Well But hey, you know when someone does good service like I'm definitely gonna take care of them too Yeah, you know, that's what we're doing but that's Jessica right we get this she's sort of she's got honestly She's kind of like a female Johnny in a way, right? She's smart. She's good looking She's witty but Maybe not the best choices maybe she didn't roll out in the best environment and And that's addressed to in the book you know there's some there's some level of ownership that gets you know Responsibility for our actions and she's the one that kind of pushes that like hey you can sit around here because At a certain point I don't get too much into it, but Johnny started saying well, you know we didn't I didn't have the right up bringing in all this and she's like hey dude No one made you quit school no one made you do this no one made you you did those things Um, but like you said these are these are These are people these are normal people these are people in the world these are people I grew up with these are my friends to this day People I met along the way Now That's kind of your main characters one more character I want to introduce and they look there's a bunch There are a lot more characters in the book I didn't say a lot more I tried to limit the number of characters as much as possible right I don't want to have this big complex Story line that's hard to follow. I wanted it to be when you heard someone I want you just to know who it is and boom your locked That was my goal simplicity There's another character That I want I do want to bring up because he does you got some he's got some a little bit of impact And this character as you heard from the review from the publisher weekly review Johnny and go they work at a big box store And their boss is this guy named Gerald Lundstrom Jerry also known as Jerry and they call him The Weasel that's what they call so let's get an introduction to Gerald Lundstrom the Weasel let's get an introduction to the big box store To what their jobs are and what they do there Their stock boys so here we go You would think Americans Survived on fucking mayonnaise goat says disgusted no shit Stockboys boxes tile floor and industrial shelves food detergent Electronics pretty much anything can be found here Every day from the time the doors open until they close there are customers here buying milk and batteries and toilet paper and garbage bags Tomatoes popcorn salami People can buy anything here and they do Consumption in massive quantities to fill their massive bellies and run up their massive credit card debt People flesh cover grow-bob beings in need of fuel and meaning They find both here I mean honestly who the fuck needs a half a gallon of miracle whip for their house goat asks Honestly trying to comprehend this madness well obviously a bunch of people need it all this will be gone in a couple of days Go shakes his head what the hell do they do with it Do they put it in their cereal or something? I think they butter their wives up with it God damn that's fucking disgusting yet is Johnny agrees From the end of the aisle allowed high pitched voice breaks their conversation Jerry the night manager You guys need to stop talking and get that stuff stacked up less talking and more stocking We still got pickles mustard, Chris go and can ham I got your can ham go whispers under his breath Jerry walks toward goat and Johnny Finn late 30s Smoker greasy hair beige Levi dockers polo shirt yellow Gold colored necklace with cross gold colored watch fake What did you say Jerry asked aggressively? goat stand up goat stands up straight and belts out I said I got your caned ham Jerry shakes his head he tries to think of an original comeback but he can't think of anything good He resorts to all he knows well you just keep running your mouth like that and we'll see if you ever make Supervisor Not wanting to engage in a verbal battle Jerry quickly walks away goat stands there shaking his head mother fucker he says quietly Then unable to contain himself shouts supervise this you weasel look in mother fucker Johnny looks at him I'd fucking kill myself if I ever made supervisor at this shit hole Yeah, not fucking prick walking around like he's fucking Steve Jobs loser fucking loser At least he's easy to rip off Johnny concedes he has got that going form I'm getting a couple bottles of jack tonight goats has getting the nasty as rot gut gin I can find So there you go that's the manager have you ever had a manager like like my boy like the weasel Yes, there you go God Do I need to do character development or do we know who Jerry the weasel lunch term is right? We're gonna use the schema unknown in the first and um I had so much fun writing that dialogue a her chocolate hard k dog behind the scenes over there chocolate I was wrong some of the just because that's what it's like right you know you're 22 23 years old You're having you have a crap job You know you don't they've broke Yeah, he was a stock boy at Target and she was a stockboy when he was a target and he was like 15 And he's like you nailed the you nailed that dialogue you nailed those characters And I go how's that I said how can that be you weren't like that and he was no I wasn't like that I was 15 just trying to do a good job and trying to get money he goes but I worked with guys That shouldn't have been working there that we're 22 23 24 years old and I would hear them talking and you freaking nailed it He's guys talk to each other and talk shit So we all know managers like this kind of a stereotypical manager And that's the way the world kind of gets put together for this book now Again, I don't want to spend I don't want to start covering the plot of the book you kind of heard it from the review a little bit of what happens in the plot You don't get the whole deal, but that's sort of the directional heading in gotta get the book to get there But I did want to kind of just talk about some of the themes some of the other themes that are in the book One of them is is kind of this Ideal of being obsessed with random things which we all certainly do I do we all end up obsessed with these random things and if you look at it from the outside It doesn't make any sense so jiu jitsu surfing archery rock climbing music guitars NASCAR Leap lawn super into your lawn right super into fishing super into yoga super into cooking Super into grit like there's all these things that people just get into and That level of obsession Could be about anything right and that was that was one of the fun things that I had with already was I was thinking what would be the most random kind of thing that you could be obsessed with how about Laundry do laundry but there's not that much difference between being obsessed with doing laundry and and Archery yeah, and I'm believe me. I'm pretty obsessed with archery. I spend a bunch of time doing it. I spent money on it like Why I could be making super clean clothes Jiu jitsu hey we're super in a jitsu yeah, we could talk about this freaking skill on this and that but At this point we have kind of the basic skills that we need to defend ourselves. We're just doing it All-nother reason right lawns right like lawn care people get fired up for that stuff So that's something that we do It's an underlying theme in the book is man think about what you're doing. What do you obsess with why you obsess with it We're getting this weird stuff. Yeah Yeah, it is weird. consumerism Buying stuff as another thing we do you wrap that you wrap the obsession around Also around a consumerism buying stuff and If you've ever been to a big box store, which I certainly have been too many and Still go to Or Sasha should say still shop at because Because I don't go to them very often. I'm okay my wife kind of gets that done But you go into those places and it's so we consume a lot of stuff right and here's here's what I think is interesting and now I days you know this this this book takes place in the Early 90s late 80s. I'm gonna say early 90s So there's no cell phones But one thing that I've found that I think I believe and you can tell me what you think I think we I think have you ever built something? Yes, sir. I have any gave that took you some time and effort What's the biggest thing you've ever built big biggest yeah, I don't know but That wasn't that did not come from IKEA Yeah, so okay, so I don't know the biggest thing that's gonna take a lot from me think of but the thing that did jump out at me was I used to make slingshots one of the kids okay so You go down in my case I go down the valley the canyon And you'd find a guava tree and I like the guava tree would you and then you find where there's like a perfect Why it can be like too narrow of a split got to be any can't be too wide either a lot of those You got to find the perfect one When we cut it cut it all three spots and you bring it back You skin it Let it dry for a little bit like a few days or whatever I used it this is when I went extra on it. I'd sand it down so it looks kind of cool You can put finish on it. I never really did that and then you go by it's called surgical tubing Then you yeah, you attach them and then you cut off the tongue of your shoe I'm like an old shoe or whatever you cut it off and then poke the two holes Use a knife or even like a whole puncher. It's harder to do the whole puncher, but you know you did the two holes attach the Surgery surgical tubing what I would do is I do this Circle surgical tubing go in the hole curl back. I'd super glue it together Wrap it with thread not too tight because it might start cutting into when it starts to oxidize a little bit and then tape like small piece of tape It would be super strong super strong the same thing both sides are all four Attachments and boom there you go looks nice too How did you feel when you were complete? Yeah amazing that's why I do a bunch of them like I don't need like five slingshots But yeah, yeah, I got the two or three going so I think there's some I don't know there's probably some Chemical dopamine hit or whatever that get when you actually do something when you build something like I've built So like like redoing my house like re-mod like ripping out gutting my hat one time I did my kitchen and I gutted it In 72 hours I gutted the whole thing demoed it got it out Readed the electrical read the plumbing Put in a sub box what's that called? I put in a sub box for the electrical I forget what it's called but I put in like a whole new electrical system and then I dry walled it And I did that all in 72 hours and but you feel like accomplishment right? Building like fences at my houses building I I remodeled my other house so like these major projects You feel this good sense of satisfaction when you're done Well in the modern world we do a lot less of that right so what so you can replace that sort of satisfaction By clicking on the Amazon whatever by now right and all of a sudden you feel like but the thing is since you didn't put much effort into it It's not that gratifying so you want to do it again. Yeah, so I think that's why people roll in the freaking Costco They roll in the Costco and they roll out with way more stuff because they just walk through those eyes getting that dopamine hit Dopamine hit Because they feel like they built That thing or they harvest it. Yeah, it's the same thing when you go hunting and you like harvest the meat Super gratifying Super like 1000 times more gratifying Then buying a stake at the store and believe me buying a stake at the store is kind of gratifying too But you get that dopamine you're like oh yeah, then we're this gonna be so good But it's way less so you buy another one, right? You know, then you buy this and you buy that right? Yeah, that's weird huh, so it's kind of like when you kind of Maybe cut it all the way down to what that's going on with that little transaction It's like you know like almost for like better way of putting it in the wild or in the you know nature whatever You put in this work and then you You run through some challenges you overcome those challenges then you get the reward right? That sort of the system and your brain You know follow along accordingly boom you put in the work you get obsessive over it You run into a challenge you overcome the challenge and you're back on your path to you know for that main goal You know and the heart of you work the bigger the reward usually right? It's far as in your brain like the bigger the payoff you know, so it's like if you go for a College and then you then you really finally reap that reward in your case. It's hunting the elk or you know Whatever whatever the reward is the prize right there boom there's your your ultimate Satisfying dopamine hit whatever but now It's the same thing except you reduce the work parts so much, but you still get the little reward You know, but here's the thing you reduce the work the reward you get rewarded, but it's less work Less rewards, so what do you do you do to get less satisfying? Yeah, it's not much you just do it again. Oh, yeah, the culminate order this. I'm gonna buy that And see you end up in this sort of weird cycle of of Satisfaction by just buying stuff Brad the and you know, and we've talked about this two brothers the people who make the stores The layout and stuff all they know about that kind of stuff. That's why there's a thing called impulse buy right So they put the candy right there by the checkout stuff that you didn't plan on getting But it's like I think he's one of those right now. You know kind of a thing it's like a impulse by you ever get I don't see you doing this, but maybe you do I don't know, but you know when you shop it on Amazon right and And me I get a lot of care will relate to this where I get a lot of little cables and little tools In whatever you know just for this thing or that thing or whatever and then when you check out or when you add it to the cart They'll introduce all these other things You can't play it. It's a bot Yeah, then I'm like yeah, you sure you're like double me. No, no, oh, yeah I could use that never gonna use it, but I could imagine myself using this pair of pliers You know, so many I have two pairs of pliers by the way, I already But that one with the red handle and I was kind of dope. I'm headed as a little thing on the side. I am the I am the most I research stuff to the point where it's stupid you can try to get me to buy something I was looking at I was looking at one of my kids Yeah, my kids Instagram and my my daughter was like oh, I have an advertisement every third Whatever picture is an advertisement And I go that no like oh, I hardly have any and I she's like no way and I showed her and I have like almost a no Promoted ads We know why I never click on them and they know I'm like low Low conversion conversion I'm like the lowest conversion ever I'm not even wasting their money throwing that thing you're crawling for me because you you could have the best freaking idea in the world And I'm gonna start like I'm gonna have to research that Yeah, I'm surprised Amazon just doesn't check me out without showing me anything because they're just over But yeah, don't even try So that's an underlying theme, but here's here's the here's the kind of the real I don't know maybe it's that maybe it's the heaviest underlying theme is just the idea and it is it's about happiness, right? Not only about happiness, but this sort of underlying Being Unappiness in the world underlying sadness in the world When I was a kid and I was working in Wendy's and I saw a gene and I saw that she was freaking happy And I knew That I wasn't And I didn't even know if I could be it didn't seem like an achievable thing it seemed like there was too much It seemed like there was too much Underlying Things in the world that just are gonna be bad Right And I always sense that in the world I always sensed always I always had this sense in the world of this underlying sadness Is underlying despair this underlying suffering And I don't want to use the term depression because maybe you wrap all those things together because depression seems like it's a clinical Sort of like a problem that you treat type thing and I didn't feel like this was a clinical problem It just seemed like life to me Was not the gonna go the way you wanted it to go Go For anyone You're gonna end up in a wrong job you're gonna end up in the wrong relationship you're gonna something's gonna be wrong with your health Something's gonna be wrong in your family And we're gonna die I we're all gonna die and before we died we're gonna suffer And by the way everyone that you know and everyone that you love is gonna suffer and die I And so I would always I kind of had this underlying sense of the world And then I would catch like glimpses of people that were happy and Sometimes it was someone like Jean there was another guy that worked at a freaking junkyard Who was kind of jacked? Especially when I was younger you know when you were younger and in the in the 70s if someone was jacked in the 70s like it was a whole It was like the next level right Because you're you're not used to seeing people that are jacked at all and I remember seeing this guy who has It worked at a junkyard and And he looked happy and I was like dude this guy's just jacked and just lived in engine parts around the junkyard And it seemed like he was happy So That's sort of this underlying team and I'll tell you like when I got to the teams thank god When I got to the teams that's when I started feeling like oh Like kind of happy like this is cool that people on with are kind of cool and life's not going to be perfect But we're going to have a good time living this imperfect life So I started to get a little bit relieved of that as I got a little as I got older But I think that You know Johnny kind of realizes that he's not going to be happy And this is the other sort of the other sort of underlying theme is this idea of Sacrifice and When Johnny realizes that he can't be happy or at least he doesn't think he can't happy He sees that you know kind of the way I looked at Jean the Wendy salad bar girl But that's his brother And the situation unfolds where he's not going to be able to be happy anymore where where Arty is not going to be happy anymore and Johnny knows if he makes sacrifices he could preserve the happiness for his brother Especially because he's never going to be happy himself um You know I had this conversation with stoner one time we're out surfing and he was asking me that we said bro I don't know it's like the same thing He's like bro, I'm never going to be out how you how am I ever going to be happy? I'm never going to be happy You know we were literally it's like a beautiful Southern California we're out in our surf spot For whatever reason there's not many guys out there's a little offshore breeze the waters warm It's a you know chest to head high swell pretty consistent like it's it doesn't get any better Hmm and he's out of here saying to me like I don't know how do you ever how you ever find happiness and I'm like bro This is it man. This is it right here and that's what you Know that's what that's what you have to be able to find You have to be able to find that the path that you're on Would even though it's challenging even though they're suffering that's that's the happiness too And the sacrifice part is putting others above yourself. You know and obviously on this podcast we talk about heroes and we talk to heroes in many cases And both the ones that we talk to here are military people right soldiers sailors airman Marines But those aren't the only people It doesn't the only people in the world that are heroes right and and I'm not just talking about law enforcement and you know firefighters and first responders Well, there's all kinds of people in the world that put others above themselves And put other people's happiness above themselves and And whether that's mothers and fathers and Sisters and brothers and wives and husband and friends. I mean there's friends that do that Friends that put other people's happiness and other people's success above themselves and Really that's that's the underl... that's one of the other underlying themes of the book Is and that you know that's that's a theme that's consistent with all the books that have written fiction nonfiction people that are putting others above themselves That's what leadership is and Ultimately That's what life is about So I think if you can put other others before yourselves Then if we do that then you can find some happiness and add a minimum at a minimum You can leave the world in better condition than you found it And If you can pull that off I think if you can pull that off Then you can die with a clean and conscience and you can die with a smile on your face And you can leave a smile on the face of the people you left behind And that's a good life And that is I mean So We can't obviously cover the whole plot the details what we'll do is maybe in a year Remember what we did with Musashi yeah with Musashi so this is episode 301 episode 401 That's actually two years isn't it? Yeah People two years to sort it out is that long not what we do one year so we do so we say 350 Okay, we'll go 350 will shoot for 350 so 350 will do full spoiler will just tell everyone what's going on We'll take a bunch of questions about the book And yeah, we'll do it again what we can go a little bit deeper on all the plot You know as I start getting feedback from people and people start asking all those awesome questions that you ask when you read books and what's this part about? What is this represent we'll do all that? The books for for sale right now I would order it if I were you why I think clearly because you want that first of this And there's another this is us against the establishment by the way This is us against the literary critics Right this is us against the big publishing companies the media companies Where did the outsiders I'm an outsider I'm telling you what I go to New York City And I roll into those publishing offices I am an outsider I might as well be purple Because I'm not from that world right They don't they the interesting thing is I mean I was an English major in college They don't know about that they just look at me think knuckle dragger Meathead which I take is a compliment. Yes, certainly But yeah, they don't want us to win so Join the cause right Let's let's let's let's take the fight to them Get that first edition and here's the other thing I was planning to do a Speaking thing kind of like jockel live what we did last year right before COVID hit I was we were booking it up and the whole freaking The industry still paranoid and a bunch of the venues started getting crazy with the way they were gonna run them and some of them wanted to cancel And so I said all right fine, we'll put it off so I'm gonna do a jockel live tour with this I don't know I don't know what cities I'm going to the only city I Keep saying I want to go to is Detroit I just want to go to Detroit and by the way, there's so you knew Jack White is Jack White stripes. Oh, I'm thinking totally No, I do now. Yeah, so he's got a thing up in Detroit He's got a place where he can record Bands Straight to vinyl So it just straight to vinyl. I think it's a venue that holds like 50 people So I want to do jockel live there. I want to record it straight to the white Yeah, and this get Artisan on us yeah, bro straight to vinyl house I think it might be the only place in America where you can do that That sounds correct and plus the white stripes are awesome jackwights freaking awesome So that would be sick to do so I'm gonna try and go to Detroit maybe after do a big show before that To get everyone in there, but then after that We'll go straight to third man records Straight to vinyl Do you have a record player? Yeah Let's look into that one one my Amazon spirals the record player they have a lot. Oh, he's yeah It's vinyl dude. Yeah, it's not going right. It's just we're talking about people being obsessed with things Yeah, vinyl's one of them yeah get that vinyl out that record sounds better allegedly I remember there's there's a motorhead album where he put in between the songs on the CD Has like the record sound like this Come out back pretty sick, right? Yeah, well that's I mean even with film that's all right It's like no film looks like way better video end and photography They're like not film all day. Yeah, I'll walk Black did this lame lame doesn't look as good does it look as natural doesn't look as you know Doesn't flow with your senses So Detroit that's one city. I know I'm going to why cuz we want to get flow with our senses Yes, sir. We're going straight to vinyl industry to vinyl. I don't even know if it's a possible thing I don't I don't know if it's possible Bet you know people might be like you can't do that you need you're not even a band No, I'm gonna talk though. Yeah, it's an out you've done albums We have no withdrawing milk right so this would be an album now. I'm straight up You've been to jockel lives. Yes, sir. I have some of the money being cool record right Yes, sir. They would be vinyl vinyl all day man. Then you get clear vinyl you get the red vinyl right? You don't say I don't know what red vinyl is but the vinyl's red that's what red vinyl is where you get the clear vinyl What's clear vinyl clear the record's clear you can see through it You're heard of it. I never heard of that okay dogs in the house in the game. Yeah, oh So when I do that thing, but I guess it's gonna be spring or something like that we'll go live We'll hang out if you're rolling up you got that second edition. Let's face it I'm still appreciative But you know I know we all know where you're at Yeah, appreciate the support. Let's crush the world with this book Echo speaking of crush in the world we kind of have to crush ourselves Right in order to crush the world which by the way. Hey, you tougher. Yeah, which by the way I came just came back from hunting and for I think it was 13 days. I did not lift weights Because I was in the mountains Or as I call mountains but I came back and I was all fired up, you know and felt like I need Man I have domes in my arms right now In my I haven't had domes in my arms in a long time So we got across ourselves that can take a toll at times What do we need to do to kind of stay on the path to get better? Well, so we across the world Well, keep in mind mentally and physically. Domes in the arms that indicates that you're working out your arms which I respect So you know, I'm sorry they have the dump but welcome to my world Well, okay, so we want to minimize domes. Well, no, no maximize yet minimize mitigate domes. Okay. Yeah, I would say that's a good call. It's kind of a dichotomy really Mm-hmm, but let's face it would you would you want to have domes every day on your arms with that include that Increased progress or not If you bad, right you know, I obviously there's a lot to it, but generally speaking simply put Domes every day. No, probably not okay. You want when the domes heels Then you want to elicit more domes and what do I have? But that's a process is then it's ongoing unless all right what you do need a supplementation that'll help you Do domes or no domes right on you So through this path rolling on supplementation is very helpful. So we'll talk about energy drinks first Right as far as energy see I know I said it energy drinks As if that is if what we're talking about fits in with all the other categories of all these other Drinks that are in the energy drink category. Yeah, so man, you know me if you're new to this when they're not There's things that they don't don't that stigma that you felt like in your brain I would ever order you drink so that stigma don't worry about that that's dig many more in fact forget that's digma forget it Don't totally forget it because there's other drinks that still have you need to keep the stigma in mind Yeah, but you can have the stigma of waitings. Yes, like you'd like like detach from the state Yeah, but that leave it behind just leave it behind it doesn't control your brain and how you think of energy drinks necessarily anymore if you know about Jocco go okay, I can is a discipline go or jocco go it is Jocco discipline go like I agree speaking I got corrected by someone on the inside which I respected by the way But either way Go Jocco discipline go said energy drink that is good for you front to back good for you not the kind where you drinking And You know what have you ever seen that there's this commercial I think one of these comedy YouTube Channels they're like oh if some like if energy drink commercials were honest or whatever they call it like a A metal tube of Psychedelic poison and something but if they they kept referring to it as a metal tube but some kind of place Accurate yeah, oh, Brad watch the video. It's funny. You're like they own that is all true That is it's interesting either way it's not that the stomach of the sis no poison It's different. Yeah, actually good for you. It's good for you. It's like a health Drink energy drink, but even though that makes it sound kind of like not really what it feels like Just keep in mind. It's an energy drink a taste good is good and it's good for you and gives you energy and gives you legit no chemicals These weird preservative things because of process high quality it's quality Many flavors the best in which is mango factually Yeah, but you're gonna have to choose for yourself on that one. It's called jocco go. Oh That junk warfare. Yes, sir. To come into it. Yeah, I I must say even joint welfare has its limitations because I Need more right now. I take it every day. Thank God because otherwise I might need to be completely immobilized right now Well, you're delayed up here's thing drone warfare is not gonna help your dogs. I really I mean I mean me what is the problem the problem the protein protein is not help your dog So joints joint warfare super curl Right but when it comes to actual rebuild We need to go moke. Yep. That's for the muscle. Yes Additional protein in the form of the dessert. I know what I had for breakfast this morning Which I normally don't eat moke Guess what I had for lunch? Moke because I could I knew what you just don't look the doms I know it needs to be yes, sir. I need to repair my muscles.
