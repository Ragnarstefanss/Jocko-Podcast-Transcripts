but that's kind of a good thing about this is that that's not what it is you know how like you'll explain like you know part of it and this is a total pair of phrasing situation but you said it in a really good way before when you're like memorize the feeling after you're working or something like that see that's like that's not you're not inspiring me to go work out you're kind of pragmatically telling me like this is how you mentally wage an effective war on that little weakness there that's what it is you know in tracks doing this for all kinds of situations called psychological warfare joc go willing that's a good one also I have some other options now if you want to kind of support this podcast you can check out origin main dot com for your due to your needs we are now unified fully with origin made in America like me I would say like echo but echo is actually made in Canada I see that the whole task force was my friend I watched a marine sergeant in a TV documentary his eyes showing the emotion of his story and the site told me we were all the same I still feel a bit angry that the wounded went unnoticed a propaganda film on the task force as a rival home showed only the pairs in the Marines in the navy homecoming can you remember seeing the badly wounded coming through the gates I think not nobody wants to see the effects of carnage never again will I think that war is just a game like they showed on TV it is very different from how it is portrayed in books and films we call ourselves into the killing game don't we I remember very clearly watching from a window of my quarters five or six kids playing a war game some were even dressed in combat gear and carrying small toy machine guns I watched with interest in their tactics and attacking a cardboard box that was meant to be an enemy held position the two kids defending rolled over and pretended to die went over run by the goodies after being tegged by their friends they got up to resume the game from me high we start to practice what is in human nature to defend and kill the one big difference between their game and the real one is that you don't get up after really being shot who are as the legal killing of people and can be very scary who are as killed or be killed we also must remember that a lot of the command structure at junior rank level can almost be too difficult to maintain in the heat of battle then what becomes a winning factor is the determination of the private soldier his loan get up and go and do attitude we must take our hats off to the junior ranks of all services for they are the backbone of the war machine in that they have to kill a close range we are lucky to have what is perhaps one of the best fighting forces in the world thanks to our system of training and to our discipline even today I feel frustration about the war I was so psyched up to carry on with the fight into Stanley that the Argentinian surrender may be disappointed as well as happy I try very hard to keep out of fist fights now as I wouldn't like to lose myself control do my alone in feeling this or their hundreds or thousands of other time bombs out there other experience veterans may be sympathetic to all of said we can only wait for the next war now to practice the art of killing again I hope I'm there to help finally I must quote a first world war veteran who told me so many years before I joined the army you'll like the army events but not war it's horrible boy he was right that therefore when I came up to and said hey man look we gotta we gotta do better than that or hey we we can't be acting like that they knew that I wasn't coming to them from a from a what's that we're from the ivory tower I wasn't looking down on them like all I can't believe you're not that way we don't act out way we're naval representatives I wasn't coming to like that I was coming to and hey we're professionals we gotta get we want to get hired to do jobs we want to kill bad guys we got to get missions we got to get mission approval those were the things that that you know I kind of passed on to to my guys was hey that's cool be a frog man but be a disciplined frog man so now you have a bunch of little sodium's boom huge reaction huge support wide spread huge support by this little action from these you know what it is actually the sodium's better because of if I'm clicking through I'm a listen I'm listening to this podcast I'm like you know I'm gonna support I'm by one of these books I'm gonna you know by lawnmowers treadmill whatever I click through the website just that two seconds of going to the website first clicking through that's like so much potential in my click just like the the sodium so much potential energy in there especially when you mix it with the water you mix it with the Amazon the click boom support you follow we can move on Corpore Stephen hoped 27 private Timothy Jenkins 19 private Craig Jones 20 private Stewart Lang 20 Lance Corpore Christopher Love it 24 Corpore Keith McCarthy 27 Sergeant Ian McCay Victoria Cross 29 Corpore Stewart McCoffland 27 Lance Corpore James Murdock 25 Lance Corpore David Scott 24 private Ian Skriven's 17 Corpore Alex Shaw 25 private Philip West 19 and you notice those names those men their ages and their ranks they're all their all junior ranks the one sergeant sergeant Ian McCay who was awarded the Victoria Cross for storming 50 caliber machine gun mission but the rest of those men are privates and Lance Corpore's and Corpore's young men and as Kipling pointed out they're no plaster saints by any stretch but damn they might not be saints but I've no men like these and I've seen them with my eyes and as I have said and as this tale of the Falquins confirms once again war is hell and it's a hell that can bring out the worst in men but it can also bring out the best and don't forget these young men who like so many others answered the call fought and died in that awful place to protect their brothers and for the more and if you read this book you will realize that we all have a little bit more to give mentally and physically you can go further you can push harder you can be more ruthless if you have to be and you can also show more mercy you can be better I can be better we can all be better and we most often get better not from the easy things and not from the good times but from the hard times then the challenges and the suffering in life that pushes you to your breaking point and demands that you give absolutely everything you have but you have to keep going so no matter what keep going and I think that's all that I've got for tonight to be yeah he's not doing this whole part here in that my hands are going like this they're going like this so they're above my head I don't know what I'm gonna like it maybe Brandon Peckworth is doing eight inch or 12 inch vertical leap on each one like a beast and we're calling him out and he's actually I know he's doing it the cracker and yeah legs fully shoulders not chest like I think you know do it a push up one every you know second isn't that much for me but strangely my shoulders and this part that like what you call these the serrats they're like sore next day you know weird way it was weird man none the last I got a self-cuff police anyway back to these books if yeah if you want to get any of these books one or more whatever they're listed by episode on the website jocopotcast.com and and by the way we started off today before he record record record I said to echo you know you heard the book the what's that saying don't judge a book by its cover the cover of this book you can judge it by it's called excursion to hell by Lance Corporal Vincent Bramley and the picture on the cover looks like hell it looks like it's a picture of him it's blown up real big oh yeah for sure like you're like I'm not fully participating you know training exercise I wanted those guys to be prepared to put a grenade in my mouth and be there so you get some awesome well speaking of lots of stories maybe you could tell some stories about how to support this I'd be happy to know no short story hey did you get into drinking pomegranate white tea and subsequently jockel white tea because your wife is a Brit I know now that I wasn't alone the most comforting words I ever had to help me did not come from any of my family my family were concerned but could never really understand what I was going through those words came from my friends in the pub as we drank during leave Johnny turned to me and said vents I've had a few turns in the night you know that made me sit up and see clearly that I wasn't alone and when you're not alone you're stronger so that's something that I hear from a lot of vets and maybe you're thinking that this is something you're experiencing that no one else is not true not only are other guys going through it other guys have always gone through it you're not alone back to the book I fully believe that we as a nation performed the most excellent of tasks I'm fully behind the decision to send the task force and I wouldn't hesitate to fight again for a country and its beliefs people who win jibbout the decisions taken in war they weren't involved in to me are the most misguided of all the most striking events to affect me throughout the war were obviously the deaths of my friends eight years ago I regarded those friends as those in two and three pairs only now after learning about others experiences and after watching and reading others accounts It's a crack more, but then when they get far enough away, you don't hear that anymore and it just sounds like he's talking about like a little zip, like a little, you know, but I knew it was the first time I ever got shot at, I knew exactly what it was. but I feel like if I would have put my hands above my head on those four it wouldn't have made a difference that's what I think but if I'm like you know the kind where I'm filming at the master you know I'm filming this girl she's doing the perfect burpy while I'm filming her chest to the ground in fact when she went chest to ground her hands came up off the ground oh just for like a second I'm like dang this feels like you know what do they call the girls I think they call this game day pushups I don't know how like you know how like let's say you had like a pimple or something or is it I know I'm going deep so I'm like you know all my clothes are all wet from my sweat and usually that's not part of the movie when you watch the movie you know or like these guys is for just feet are falling off you know because it's cold and I was sitting in a combat outpost in Ramadi and it was nighttime yeah like what like a like a 100 terabyte hard drive how much is that cost like four to five grand I was kind of hesitating but listen we have some supplements coming for you as soon as we as soon as as soon as I started with Pete who is my partner at origin as soon as we kind of started talking as soon as we soon as it looked like we were going to solidify a deal we started we started he's got these got a little supplement line which gives the opportunity gave the opportunity gives the opportunity for me design the supplements so a little while back we had that opportunity designed him made him went on him legit you're gear alone you're your body armor helmet ammo magazines you know magazines an ammo grenades you're your 60 70 pounds then you put water that you're talking I think I think I weighed like 310 or something with like you're on seriously like roll well like what you're thinking yeah people want to know what the thing about big deal for some reason they ask me like what do you think in there I answer it that's why wrote that book right it's like it's like that's you know when you didn't do a burpee let's face it if we wanted to you know get some Guinness Book of World's right scenario then because I don't like saying journey that's what I'm saying message you and said hey quit saying journey say campaign against weakness which is actually from the podcast which is legit layers big time anyway thanks Andy for that one but that's the one I'm using for right now until like a better one comes up if that's even possible so in your campaign against weakness every single day for the rest of your life now that's you're in the game right now it's for the rest of your life no actually we didn't do that you know why it's going strong because of word a mouth that's what it's going strong for because one person gets it they buy it for this person that person buys it for someone else that person buys it for their team that's why we're still selling that thing like crazy why and why was it going through word a mouth because it works functionally works it's not theoretical it is pragmatic it's functional it'll make you a better leader and it'll make your team better period we've seen this over and over and over again that's why it's selling a lot so get yourself and your team so you can implement that but I didn't touch my chest and there were like four of them that I didn't put like four because when I started the set I'm like oh shoot those you know two or three I didn't put my hands above my head so I didn't show it and they start driving back to their compound back to the book always very quiet on the journey the English countryside made me feel like an alien Johnny tapped my shoulder from behind Vince the trees man look at them I looked at the trees they were part of what was making me feel like an alien they were all in full bloom bright green leaves in the wind there was traffic on the roads shops people walking about doing their own thing it all seemed unreal after only three months away it was a shock to see civilization again the odd thing was I felt anger anger and everyone for doing their own thing it was as if something in my head was urging me to shout at them as they walked along the streets so what I mean over the head like technically has to be above the head so if I go like this or doesn't have to be well this you guys do this I do a little bit of everything and depending on how tired I am okay if you see when I'm really tired my clap was barely happening and it's happened and like six inches in front of my belly yeah that whole island they don't really like iced tea like you can't go to restaurant all so iced tea they look at you like you're weird I'm gonna recommend it if you're into kettlebells you want to you know get your kettlebells on get on it once they're cooler that's my opinion good a lot of cool stuff I got a jump rope and stuff like that too um you know what I'll say did hundred burpees in 10 minutes And, you know, it's like, Lave talking, I've ever, you know, getting ready to go into Somalia or Rwanda, I had like hundreds of pounds of gear, grenades. I know the general public was concerned but it just didn't seem like it then I wasn't expecting a metal or even a pad on the back I really didn't know what to expect even so I found it hard to become there was no way I could relax if I had been asked to go do a torn Ireland I would have gone more than anything I felt the pinch of no longer having my friends around me we had been together so tightly over the last few months that it was as if now I had had a set an arm severed the buddy buddy system that we had needed to literally survive wasn't there anymore and the sheltered life now seemed too far but now seemed to me far too boring to endure I made a point of not talking about my experiences to any member of my family including my wife but if you have a zit some people they're like I'm gonna pop this in some people they're like no leave it alone let it go away you see what I'm saying so I'm like the so they went in there if they would have picked up like two or three things off of that it was a pressure plate a pressure release so if they were picked up two or three things they would have gotten killed his him and his crew would have gotten killed and that's when he realized you know when he talks about he's like I was so greedy I wasn't even thinking anymore they go through that they eventually they get done they ship away and eventually end up two but what if you know because if you want to do that what you do you put your your you put your 135 on the ground a barbell with 135 on it and you hop over that and each time chest to the ground on one side chest the ground on the other side chest to the that's another way if you're going to require I like when you can't cheat and you got that day where you supposed to wake up early and you don't want to you just don't feel like it that's really the thing you don't feel like it you know so that's analogy I was gonna make but seems kind of trivial you know compared to like guys on the freeway I like our story that's out of police yeah it's a great book there's a lot to learn from it there's a lot to learn again I that that the way that they're going from peacetime and again I know that they were doing tours in Ireland at the time and that was no joke and they took casualties in Ireland and there was many soldiers killed in northern Ireland but that wasn't comparable to what they went through in the focklands so it was interesting to see how they handled approaching combat for the first time but if you just take one little step like in your mind and and look in the car and look that's a person in there and maybe sometimes two people in there sometimes a little family each one of those people has their whole life story all the little ups and downs and special things and you know challenges challenge struggles and triumphs all that stuff so how I did it was 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest 15 and then like two minute minute and a half maybe I don't know something like that give or take and then a 10 and actually sorry 11 and it's almost like they get into that mode of like who cares anyways we're gonna die we're gonna die we just you know who cares I'm just I'm just a nothing but a straight warrior don't care about anything else I'm here to go to war otherwise leave me alone what you want to do is you want to get those guys out into the world socialize them like a good attack dog that that's not going to bite anything in front of it's going to actually bite what you want it to bite but after you go to war for an extended period of time you're like actually you're not gonna die actually there's a decent chance you're gonna live and there's a decent chance that you need to continue to build you know the the reputation of the seal teams not just as where killers but where professionals and I angled my back to like a 45 degree angle and I was kind of looking at the ground kind of resting a little bit and as I looked down I was full athletic sweat dripping off me like that fast but it doesn't really work what you need is to have someone that you can have out of the glass and that learns and what you have to do is a leader is you take those guys that instead of putting those guys in the glass jar or behind a in a glass box somewhere and keeping their in case war what you do is you do what you do with a freaking wild dog you have to train them you have to bring them out you have to socialize them amongst the humans so that they can so that they can interact because a guy that you have to keep in you know in behind a glass barrier from the rest of the world the chances of you needing him for that type of situation are pretty minimal so what about all the other situations that he'd be beneficial for so what you have to do is a leader is teach those guys that have the attitude of you know So when you're holding a city like the the Argentinians military is in the city of Stanley, well they know where they're going to get attacked from and they know what are good firing positions. but yeah go on there check it out if you like something get something good way to support also psychological warfare what psychological warfare is if you don't know it is in album with tracks joc would tracks and what he does is on the tracks he's talking to you each track but it's got a refreshing breath you know like you can cut loose your like off your joc was always on you're off no what kind of company is telling you hey come to our factory and see what we're all about you know what kind of company our company we're going to be up there informing can main august 23rd come on up it's 282 enter into the origin camp the immersion camp if you haven't signed for that you missed it you have to do it next year but on august 23rd we're going to be up there we'll be cruising me hanging out we'll be getting after it up at the factory you can come to see what that's all about also yeah another part that I think these books really bring to light is just the physical conditions that that they go into even talking talking to you guys when you guys talk about how hot it is then everyone's gonna all you add a detail like I mean was it like was it like an incomplete probably some of them were like yeah you can't do too many though you can't do as many those though no bear to tell you not at all that's kind of the difference between the dynamic jump like a high jump and not a dynamic jump is real big huge huge and that's the word is the line so for me here's the line get your hands above your head get your feet off the ground that's it and I think that's another thing in the book when there's no war going on how we're that you know they're they're the kind of maniacs you know but I do remember sitting up in bed one evening turning my wife and giving her a very mild insight into what had really happened I was sick to death of the presses views and of the publicity of a country still high on war I told Karen what had happened to Denzel and Jones the blank look she gave me with a half smile told me she wasn't interested and couldn't understand me at all I never said anything again I tried to look at it from her point of view instead she was sick of the war of the army and of me going away whenever I bumped into one of the lads I see more at home and relax talking our private language with him then I did with civis and my own family if I had had my own way I would have gone out on the biggest bend or ever And I'm going through it pretty quickly, but it's worth reading because, and I think it's worth reading because if you're in one of these situations, especially when you're in charge of guys that have never been to combat before, this is what you got to, it gives you a good lessons about keeping guys informed about preparing them for combat and keeping them with the right mindset going in. And not only to get sunk with the helicopter's on it, it got sunk with the things like tents and sleeping bags that's going to allow them to be, you know, operate comfortably in this cold environment. I was probably falling at a category I wasn't exactly the guy you wanted to throw out in front of the admiral to look at right and say this is our model guy right here it's you know wouldn't have been that way now at the old I got them or I recognized how important having that both sides of the of the coin covered and you couldn't just be of freaking rampaging berserk or all the time you had to actually be a professional It's like a short range kind of it's like a bazooka, but it's wire guided so you can actually steer it a little bit. treadmill is pretty big well either way you can do your shopping boom click through there takes a two seconds small action really big reaction by way of support I actually have been thinking that that is actually not the best analogy that you've been using for like you would think that because joc was talking about you about the type of toothpaste that he uses right right now I didn't say that well maybe it depends you know how there's a controversy about for right being in the toothpaste you know I'm just saying that's important I'm really egging you on today I'm just saying you brought it up yeah for sure but not a lot of people are like on YouTube you know and I just laid there and life came over to throw me in the back of the home v i was like a robot cop down there so life got a couple buddies who said hey guys help him move jockel still not moving dead weight job
