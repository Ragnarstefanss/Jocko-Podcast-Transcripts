00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.80
This is Jockel Podcast number 121 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.80 --> 00:00:32.80
I'm going to tell you a story and this is a story of war and pain and love and death.

3
00:00:32.80 --> 00:00:45.30
And this story, this is a heroic story, quite possibly one of the most heroic stories

4
00:00:45.30 --> 00:00:52.30
and at the same time, this story is also a tragedy.

5
00:00:52.30 --> 00:01:01.60
And it is quite possibly one of the most tragic stories.

6
00:01:01.60 --> 00:01:04.80
And this is a story of a father and a son.

7
00:01:04.80 --> 00:01:14.60
This is a story that spans six wars, each one more difficult than the next.

8
00:01:14.60 --> 00:01:21.10
This is a story of life.

9
00:01:21.10 --> 00:01:31.70
And like all stories of life, this story ends the way that all lives end this story ends

10
00:01:31.70 --> 00:01:35.80
in death.

11
00:01:35.80 --> 00:01:38.20
There is no story book ending.

12
00:01:38.20 --> 00:01:40.20
There is no walking off into the sunset.

13
00:01:40.20 --> 00:01:49.000
There is no mercy and no quarter and no remorse from death.

14
00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:03.70
And as I prepared to tell this story, there were times when I started to decide against it.

15
00:02:03.70 --> 00:02:11.20
Where I began to think it would be too much.

16
00:02:11.20 --> 00:02:14.000
There was another part of me.

17
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.50
That spoke louder and spoke stronger and that other part of me that knows that to hide

18
00:02:21.50 --> 00:02:31.50
from the darkness, he's only to allow darkness to grow and I will not do that.

19
00:02:31.50 --> 00:02:36.50
I will tell this story and the story that I am going to tell is not just a story,

20
00:02:36.50 --> 00:02:40.000
it is not made up.

21
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.20
The story is the real story of the real lives of two men, two marines, a father and a son

22
00:02:51.20 --> 00:03:04.08
who fought many battles, both literally and metaphorically and who did their best to fight

23
00:03:04.08 --> 00:03:17.68
and win and who we can both learn a lot from.

24
00:03:17.68 --> 00:03:23.08
But we can only learn if we listen, we can only learn if we study and we can only learn

25
00:03:23.08 --> 00:03:33.88
if we remember what these men went through, what they did.

26
00:03:33.88 --> 00:03:42.28
How they lived and how they died.

27
00:03:42.28 --> 00:03:47.88
I will begin the story with the father.

28
00:03:47.88 --> 00:03:54.48
He is the most famous marine in the history of the Marine Corps.

29
00:03:54.48 --> 00:04:00.58
He is one of the most highly decorated men in American military history.

30
00:04:00.58 --> 00:04:08.78
He is the only man ever awarded five Navy crosses.

31
00:04:08.78 --> 00:04:17.78
His name is Louis Polar, better known as Chestie Polar.

32
00:04:17.78 --> 00:04:22.18
He is to most marines the ultimate marine.

33
00:04:22.18 --> 00:04:29.78
The godfather of the Marine Corps to this day, the mascot of the Marine Corps, which is a bulldog

34
00:04:29.78 --> 00:04:36.38
that bulldog is named Chestie after Chestie Polar.

35
00:04:36.38 --> 00:04:45.86
They are currently on bulldog number 15 named Chestie the 15th in boot camp in Marine Corps

36
00:04:45.86 --> 00:04:52.38
boot camp recruits saying, good night Chestie at the end of a long day.

37
00:04:52.38 --> 00:05:00.18
He is embedded in the fiber of the Marine Corps.

38
00:05:00.18 --> 00:05:08.82
Then you might wonder who was this man and how did he become an icon to a group that

39
00:05:08.82 --> 00:05:14.60
is one of the most elite fighting forces in the history of mankind in the United States Marine

40
00:05:14.60 --> 00:05:17.10
Corps.

41
00:05:17.10 --> 00:05:24.30
In order to find out who this man is, we are going to explore a book called Marine,

42
00:05:24.30 --> 00:05:33.50
the life of Chestie Polar, written by Burke Davis.

43
00:05:33.50 --> 00:05:39.02
And I will go to the book.

44
00:05:39.02 --> 00:05:46.42
Louis Burwell Polar was born June 26th, 1898 into a small boys paradise.

45
00:05:46.42 --> 00:05:54.30
The village of West Point, Virginia, with a pommunki and Patamoni rivers formed the

46
00:05:54.30 --> 00:05:57.30
broad York.

47
00:05:57.30 --> 00:06:05.26
The waters were full of fish, crab and oysters, and the woodlands teamed with game.

48
00:06:05.26 --> 00:06:08.58
Sounds like a good place to grow up.

49
00:06:08.58 --> 00:06:15.06
He often talked of his dream of going to the Virginia Military Institute and becoming a soldier.

50
00:06:15.06 --> 00:06:19.82
He was reading his family traditions, his love of hunting, fishing, and horseback riding.

51
00:06:19.82 --> 00:06:25.06
He was drawn to a military life in VMI.

52
00:06:25.06 --> 00:06:29.18
Fifty years later, at the end of a fighting career, he would look back to those days and say,

53
00:06:29.18 --> 00:06:34.62
I learned more in the woods, hunting and stalking about the actual art of war than I ever

54
00:06:34.62 --> 00:06:37.78
learned in any school of any kind.

55
00:06:37.78 --> 00:06:44.58
Those days in the woods as a kid saved my life many a time and combat.

56
00:06:44.58 --> 00:06:48.10
Where he wanted to go in the military from a very young age.

57
00:06:48.10 --> 00:06:53.18
And of course, I always have to mention that I'm going to go very rapidly through this

58
00:06:53.18 --> 00:06:54.18
book.

59
00:06:54.18 --> 00:07:00.50
They may take a while, but I'm skipping huge parts and trying to hit the highlights.

60
00:07:00.50 --> 00:07:04.66
But to get the full information, obviously, you need to get the book and read it yourself.

61
00:07:04.66 --> 00:07:09.30
It's a fantastic book.

62
00:07:09.30 --> 00:07:19.02
To the book, his efforts at translating Caesar made him inpatient for the true message

63
00:07:19.02 --> 00:07:20.86
of the soldier author.

64
00:07:20.86 --> 00:07:26.30
He was so fascinated by the narrative of war that he devoured it in one night.

65
00:07:26.30 --> 00:07:32.58
It opened a new world for him and began a lifelong career of serious military reading.

66
00:07:32.58 --> 00:07:35.22
It's a common theme we see with great military leaders.

67
00:07:35.22 --> 00:07:36.54
They read all the time.

68
00:07:36.54 --> 00:07:42.34
And it started for him in a young age when he was translating Caesar.

69
00:07:42.34 --> 00:07:44.98
He was captain of a track team.

70
00:07:44.98 --> 00:07:51.94
It's champion high jumper and ran well in the 120 and 440 yard dashes.

71
00:07:51.94 --> 00:07:53.74
So he was fairly athletic.

72
00:07:53.74 --> 00:07:56.30
Although he's not a big guy.

73
00:07:56.30 --> 00:07:57.30
He was not a big guy.

74
00:07:57.30 --> 00:08:00.10
When you see pictures of him, he was pretty, he was relatively small and stature.

75
00:08:00.10 --> 00:08:05.66
And he was also relatively, you know, he wasn't like a bulked up guy.

76
00:08:05.66 --> 00:08:09.18
And there's stories on why they called him Chesty.

77
00:08:09.18 --> 00:08:14.06
The predominant story is even though he was small when he would march on the parade

78
00:08:14.06 --> 00:08:15.06
ground.

79
00:08:15.06 --> 00:08:16.06
He would stick his chest out.

80
00:08:16.06 --> 00:08:19.62
So they called him Chesty Poole.

81
00:08:19.62 --> 00:08:20.62
Back to the book.

82
00:08:20.62 --> 00:08:24.14
In the last week of high school, 1917, the senior class played hooky one day on the

83
00:08:24.14 --> 00:08:28.94
fury which proved to be correct that the principal would not dare expel them all.

84
00:08:28.94 --> 00:08:30.90
Lewis was the leader of this prank.

85
00:08:30.90 --> 00:08:35.98
When they returned from a swim and a six mile hike to the river, he helped to bring back

86
00:08:35.98 --> 00:08:39.94
a dozen or more bull frogs in paper bags.

87
00:08:39.94 --> 00:08:44.78
Lewis and Dave feel tossed the frogs into a school room window and were rewarded by

88
00:08:44.78 --> 00:08:49.50
screams and other sounds of pandemonium.

89
00:08:49.50 --> 00:08:54.86
So he's, you know, I had to tell at least one of those stories that he was a mischievous

90
00:08:54.86 --> 00:08:58.78
kid, you know, a little bit of a rebel.

91
00:08:58.78 --> 00:09:04.98
The enrolled he did graduate enrolled in the military military of Virginia military institute.

92
00:09:04.98 --> 00:09:07.02
And back to the book, Lewis was promoted to cadet corp.

93
00:09:07.02 --> 00:09:13.34
At the end of the year, academically he stood 177th out of 233 cadets.

94
00:09:13.34 --> 00:09:16.78
So, well, not like the front runner in the class.

95
00:09:16.78 --> 00:09:23.78
His subject standings in his class mathematics, 200th English 149th German 138th history,

96
00:09:23.78 --> 00:09:29.14
100nd and most significantly military science 89th.

97
00:09:29.14 --> 00:09:32.78
He had no demerits for the year and almost unheard of record.

98
00:09:32.78 --> 00:09:40.42
So academically, not exactly crushing it, but military bearing in what not no demerits.

99
00:09:40.42 --> 00:09:42.46
He was doing well.

100
00:09:42.46 --> 00:09:44.46
Now this is where things start to get a little bit interesting.

101
00:09:44.46 --> 00:09:45.46
Obviously, it's 1917.

102
00:09:45.46 --> 00:09:48.70
So we got World War I is going on.

103
00:09:48.70 --> 00:09:50.02
And here we go back to the book.

104
00:09:50.02 --> 00:09:54.42
As Chief Disappointment was that they were soldiers without arms.

105
00:09:54.42 --> 00:09:59.74
For the rifles were taken by the army as the war in Europe war on and ammunition had been

106
00:09:59.74 --> 00:10:03.14
two scarce for target practice.

107
00:10:03.14 --> 00:10:09.06
With that, he said, I'm going to enlist in the Marines.

108
00:10:09.06 --> 00:10:12.94
He said, I don't want the war to end without me.

109
00:10:12.94 --> 00:10:14.90
I'm going with the rifles.

110
00:10:14.90 --> 00:10:18.26
If they need them, they need me too.

111
00:10:18.26 --> 00:10:22.82
In June 27th, the day after his 20th birthday, Louis took the train to Richmond and enlisted

112
00:10:22.82 --> 00:10:28.62
in the Marine Corps, bound for boot camp at Parasiland, South Carolina.

113
00:10:28.62 --> 00:10:35.18
So I wasn't going to sit around and let that war run out on him.

114
00:10:35.18 --> 00:10:39.18
Shows up for his boot camp.

115
00:10:39.18 --> 00:10:41.02
There's a drill instructor.

116
00:10:41.02 --> 00:10:45.10
One of the great things about this book is the guy that wrote the book, Burke Davis.

117
00:10:45.10 --> 00:10:49.98
He not only sat down and interviewed Chester Poler for hundreds of hours.

118
00:10:49.98 --> 00:10:55.66
He also went and interviewed all kinds of people that interacted with Chester Puler during

119
00:10:55.66 --> 00:10:58.62
his career, which he interacted with a lot of people, because he was in the Marine Corps for

120
00:10:58.62 --> 00:11:01.46
a really long time for decades.

121
00:11:01.46 --> 00:11:06.82
And so the book has all kinds of research and all kinds of interviews.

122
00:11:06.82 --> 00:11:10.78
And one of the people that got interviewed was the drill instructor, one of the drill instructors

123
00:11:10.78 --> 00:11:15.78
that put Chester Puler through boot camp.

124
00:11:15.78 --> 00:11:20.86
John Structor, I think it was a gun research and Desparais.

125
00:11:20.86 --> 00:11:23.10
And he said, by God, he's a Marine.

126
00:11:23.10 --> 00:11:26.86
He looks as if he must sleep at attention.

127
00:11:26.86 --> 00:11:30.18
You always know I have to tell him to look mean and nasty out there marching, but I never

128
00:11:30.18 --> 00:11:31.50
had to tell him.

129
00:11:31.50 --> 00:11:32.74
He's a natural.

130
00:11:32.74 --> 00:11:37.14
He never makes the same mistake twice.

131
00:11:37.14 --> 00:11:40.26
And he talked about, he talked about Poler's military history knowledge.

132
00:11:40.26 --> 00:11:43.70
He said, hell, he gives me an inferiority complex.

133
00:11:43.70 --> 00:11:47.22
I've read some, but that kid does Von Klausowitz backwards.

134
00:11:47.22 --> 00:11:49.42
And guys, guys I never heard of.

135
00:11:49.42 --> 00:11:51.86
By the dozen, he's some kid.

136
00:11:51.86 --> 00:11:55.14
This stuff is like a religion with him.

137
00:11:55.14 --> 00:11:58.30
So that's real stuff right there.

138
00:11:58.30 --> 00:12:00.42
You know, we hear General Mattis talk about that too.

139
00:12:00.42 --> 00:12:03.94
General Mattis never gets surprised because he's read it before.

140
00:12:03.94 --> 00:12:07.26
Not gonna surprise me, because I already know, I already seen the situation before.

141
00:12:07.26 --> 00:12:10.98
I'm not exact, but I at least have an idea of it.

142
00:12:10.98 --> 00:12:21.94
The non-combs admired Poler's work on the bayonet field where big signs read advance to kill.

143
00:12:21.94 --> 00:12:27.38
For two months, the class went through intensive drills in the bayonet rifle boxing judo

144
00:12:27.38 --> 00:12:29.14
and infantry drill.

145
00:12:29.14 --> 00:12:31.02
So back in the day, they're still getting after it.

146
00:12:31.02 --> 00:12:33.38
And boxing in judo, by the way, is good combination.

147
00:12:33.38 --> 00:12:34.38
Very good combination.

148
00:12:34.38 --> 00:12:39.10
You take down, you get your grappling, and you get some striking.

149
00:12:39.10 --> 00:12:44.64
One day, the men were told that their orders had come and they were packed to leave for

150
00:12:44.64 --> 00:12:51.10
Hoboken New Jersey to ship out for France, meaning they were going to war.

151
00:12:51.10 --> 00:12:57.30
The move was postponed for several days until Arnes disday canceled the orders.

152
00:12:57.30 --> 00:13:00.06
So the end of the war came.

153
00:13:00.06 --> 00:13:05.34
He was detached and sent to the third officer's training school.

154
00:13:05.34 --> 00:13:08.94
So they took him and said, you know what, you did so good in boot camp.

155
00:13:08.94 --> 00:13:12.90
The war's over, we don't have orders, we're gonna send you to be an officer.

156
00:13:12.90 --> 00:13:16.30
Back to the book, he became a second lieutenant on June 4th two weeks later when he had

157
00:13:16.30 --> 00:13:17.82
finished machine gun school.

158
00:13:17.82 --> 00:13:20.86
The end of the war brought a huge cut in the Marine Corps.

159
00:13:20.86 --> 00:13:26.40
On June 16th, Poler was discharged with hundreds of others of his rank and he was at

160
00:13:26.40 --> 00:13:31.20
loose ends, he'd been a Marine officer for two weeks.

161
00:13:31.20 --> 00:13:36.96
Now as he's kind of processing out, he met a guy named Captain Rupertis at the Marine

162
00:13:36.96 --> 00:13:40.80
Corps headquarters and this is what the advice he gave him.

163
00:13:40.80 --> 00:13:44.72
You know, he sees this young hard charter and says, if I were you, I'd go down to Haiti.

164
00:13:44.72 --> 00:13:49.60
You'll get commissions in the in the constabler down there and they need good men.

165
00:13:49.60 --> 00:13:51.32
And there's plenty of fighting.

166
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:53.68
You'd see action and have some fun.

167
00:13:53.68 --> 00:14:06.04
So at this point in Haiti, they'd basically built this, it's, it's a John D'Amouri,

168
00:14:06.04 --> 00:14:08.20
as well as John D'Amouri, as what they call it.

169
00:14:08.20 --> 00:14:15.28
But it's a military force that also does police work kind of.

170
00:14:15.28 --> 00:14:20.32
So and there was a revolution in Haiti, there was issues in Haiti and so America actually

171
00:14:20.32 --> 00:14:22.44
invaded Haiti in 1915.

172
00:14:22.44 --> 00:14:28.68
And now they had established this force to keep things under control and the way they did

173
00:14:28.68 --> 00:14:37.32
it, it was run, they took the locals and they put basically hired former Marines to

174
00:14:37.32 --> 00:14:38.64
be in charge of them.

175
00:14:38.64 --> 00:14:46.04
And then the goal was as the locals, the native Haitians, started to understand military

176
00:14:46.04 --> 00:14:51.32
operations, they would get promoted and the American Marines and soldiers could go home.

177
00:14:51.32 --> 00:14:52.32
That was the plan.

178
00:14:52.32 --> 00:14:56.96
So let's see, kind of just covered this.

179
00:14:56.96 --> 00:15:01.64
But Haiti was striped, was the striped torn, western tip of the island shared with the Dominican

180
00:15:01.64 --> 00:15:03.20
Republic, revolution had been shaken.

181
00:15:03.20 --> 00:15:08.000
The government's is 1914, after almost a century of freedom from France since 1916.

182
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.72
At the request of the Haitian government, Marines had police the country, amid violence

183
00:15:12.72 --> 00:15:16.60
which had taken nearly 2,000 lives, almost all Haitians.

184
00:15:16.60 --> 00:15:22.20
General Schmedley, smoothly butler who will get to sometime on this podcast, had created

185
00:15:22.20 --> 00:15:29.32
the John D'Amouri de Haiti with a true disregard for precedent.

186
00:15:29.32 --> 00:15:33.76
The senior officers were US Marine officers who's briefed tours of two years created

187
00:15:33.76 --> 00:15:35.96
a supply of field-trained commanders.

188
00:15:35.96 --> 00:15:42.24
But he chose the Marine and listed men to act as junior officers and allowed them to stay

189
00:15:42.24 --> 00:15:47.000
as long as they wish on the theory that they became more valuable as they learned the language

190
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and customs of the people.

191
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.12
In practice it was these Marines, these Marines and listed men who operated the force.

192
00:15:55.12 --> 00:15:59.52
Under them were many native soldiers, most of them veterans of the old Haitian army.

193
00:15:59.52 --> 00:16:02.28
From this pool they were drawn second-to-tenits and sergeants and corporals.

194
00:16:02.28 --> 00:16:03.28
That's what you have.

195
00:16:03.28 --> 00:16:04.28
That's the situation.

196
00:16:04.28 --> 00:16:05.28
So he deployed down there.

197
00:16:05.28 --> 00:16:07.64
He's not really in the Marine Corps.

198
00:16:07.64 --> 00:16:12.36
He's a hired hand basically.

199
00:16:12.36 --> 00:16:18.60
So now he's there, not for very long, and back to the book about 4pm without warning, Lewis

200
00:16:18.60 --> 00:16:22.92
stumbled into the first fight of his career and proved his instinct for combat.

201
00:16:22.92 --> 00:16:27.68
The pack train, this is a group he was moving, a group of people through the woods.

202
00:16:27.68 --> 00:16:32.40
The pack train was ambling around a wooded bent between hills which were littered with stones

203
00:16:32.40 --> 00:16:33.40
and cactus.

204
00:16:33.40 --> 00:16:37.72
When it meant an oncoming caco band, this is the revolutionaries I guess you call them.

205
00:16:37.72 --> 00:16:42.92
The caco band of about 100 equally surprised and in the same formation.

206
00:16:42.92 --> 00:16:47.92
All their sport is spurred his horse and yelled charge attack.

207
00:16:47.92 --> 00:16:51.56
The column charged horses, pack meals and all.

208
00:16:51.56 --> 00:16:55.88
And in the thunder and dust, fierce gels of the caco's broke for the hills, firing a few

209
00:16:55.88 --> 00:16:56.88
stray rounds.

210
00:16:56.88 --> 00:16:58.92
So that was kind of his first combat experience.

211
00:16:58.92 --> 00:17:02.44
You got to bring that up.

212
00:17:02.44 --> 00:17:10.32
But he was defalte aggressive even in an logistics movement.

213
00:17:10.32 --> 00:17:14.24
So they got a bunch of pack horses and he's like, oh, charge.

214
00:17:14.24 --> 00:17:17.24
And it worked.

215
00:17:17.24 --> 00:17:22.000
Back to the book, another situation that he gets into from the opposite shore, a native and

216
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.92
Dominican dress wrote out on a magnificent horse, a big buckskin with white mane and tail

217
00:17:27.92 --> 00:17:33.16
who splashed through the shallows under perfect control, though without a bridal or saddle.

218
00:17:33.16 --> 00:17:38.12
A wonderful horse, Polar said, I'd surely like to have him.

219
00:17:38.12 --> 00:17:42.08
Bruno, who's one of the guys, one of the natives that was working under him, muttered

220
00:17:42.08 --> 00:17:45.44
and creole and a rifle cracked.

221
00:17:45.44 --> 00:17:47.56
Polar saw one of his men.

222
00:17:47.56 --> 00:17:50.76
Poled his rifle bolt back and ejected cartridge.

223
00:17:50.76 --> 00:17:55.64
The beautiful horse stood in the river looking nervous about his rider floated down the

224
00:17:55.64 --> 00:17:59.56
stream in a stain of blood.

225
00:17:59.56 --> 00:18:02.28
The stunned polar turned to Bruno.

226
00:18:02.28 --> 00:18:04.96
Did you order that man shot?

227
00:18:04.96 --> 00:18:07.84
Tell Sir, you said you wanted the horse.

228
00:18:07.84 --> 00:18:09.88
Anything the captain says is our command.

229
00:18:09.88 --> 00:18:12.08
We have discipline here, Sir.

230
00:18:12.08 --> 00:18:15.08
The man seemed unmoved by the cold blooded killing.

231
00:18:15.08 --> 00:18:19.68
My God, catch the horse, get the men over the river and see if you can find that man's

232
00:18:19.68 --> 00:18:20.68
family.

233
00:18:20.68 --> 00:18:26.000
And the reason I pulled this out is this line right here.

234
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.48
Lewis never again expressed himself idly before these soldiers.

235
00:18:29.48 --> 00:18:31.52
So that's a crazy story, right?

236
00:18:31.52 --> 00:18:32.60
He says, oh, that's a beautiful horse.

237
00:18:32.60 --> 00:18:37.52
I love to have that horse and they kill the horse riders just to civilian.

238
00:18:37.52 --> 00:18:40.36
But he realized the power that you have and command.

239
00:18:40.36 --> 00:18:42.40
And there's sometimes when people don't realize that.

240
00:18:42.40 --> 00:18:45.52
People don't realize how I run in that with business leaders.

241
00:18:45.52 --> 00:18:46.52
They'll walk around.

242
00:18:46.52 --> 00:18:48.56
Oh, this is crap.

243
00:18:48.56 --> 00:18:51.08
And everyone thinks it's crap that.

244
00:18:51.08 --> 00:18:55.16
Or you've got to realize that your words have meaning.

245
00:18:55.16 --> 00:18:57.92
And when you're in a senior position, your words have power.

246
00:18:57.92 --> 00:19:02.56
And so that was how he learned that lesson in a very horrible way.

247
00:19:02.56 --> 00:19:06.08
Back to the book, company A had waited the stream without opposition.

248
00:19:06.08 --> 00:19:10.40
But as they mounted the ridge beyond the rifle fired and there was a terrifying streak

249
00:19:10.40 --> 00:19:14.24
of a bullet overhead, Polar duct.

250
00:19:14.24 --> 00:19:20.56
Lieutenant Leigh D. was at his side and said Captain Polar officers do not flinch under

251
00:19:20.56 --> 00:19:21.56
fire.

252
00:19:21.56 --> 00:19:24.56
They stand the men take note of this thing.

253
00:19:24.56 --> 00:19:27.32
It is of first importance.

254
00:19:27.32 --> 00:19:30.56
So he's going to get plenty of exercise in that.

255
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:36.64
And you'll see he becomes well known for never flinching again under fire.

256
00:19:36.64 --> 00:19:39.12
Here's something about the people they were fighting these Kaco bandits.

257
00:19:39.12 --> 00:19:43.12
They carry off everybody and every wounded man.

258
00:19:43.12 --> 00:19:47.40
And when they catch our wounded, well, Captain, if you see one, you'll never forget.

259
00:19:47.40 --> 00:19:50.76
The Kaco's believe every man who dies must go before the gods.

260
00:19:50.76 --> 00:19:55.36
And they use their knives to see that when our men go, they are beyond recognition.

261
00:19:55.36 --> 00:19:58.56
They slash the face to ribbons and tear the body apart.

262
00:19:58.56 --> 00:20:04.08
You will see, Captain, it's a matter of life or death for the officers and non-commissioned

263
00:20:04.08 --> 00:20:09.52
officers here to respect, to have respect of the, from the men.

264
00:20:09.52 --> 00:20:11.56
And something more adulation.

265
00:20:11.56 --> 00:20:15.92
They must obey orders to the letter without question, though they die for it.

266
00:20:15.92 --> 00:20:18.28
There's the only way to handle men in combat.

267
00:20:18.28 --> 00:20:21.28
If you lose control, you lose lives.

268
00:20:21.28 --> 00:20:23.16
It is as simple as that.

269
00:20:23.16 --> 00:20:26.04
So there you see the super strict discipline that they're into.

270
00:20:26.04 --> 00:20:30.48
And this is something that you're going to see this theme throughout the book that

271
00:20:30.48 --> 00:20:38.40
Chesty has this, this, this reputation, which is earned of being super hard core.

272
00:20:38.40 --> 00:20:42.12
But also in the book, you're going to see over and over again that there's a huge dichotomy

273
00:20:42.12 --> 00:20:46.36
that he's super hard core, but at the same time, he knows when he needs to give people

274
00:20:46.36 --> 00:20:47.36
slack.

275
00:20:47.36 --> 00:20:50.80
He knows when he needs to be a positive reinforcement instead of a negative one.

276
00:20:50.80 --> 00:20:53.76
And his, his reputation doesn't have that.

277
00:20:53.76 --> 00:20:57.68
But that line right there, like, hey, they just need to do whatever you say.

278
00:20:57.68 --> 00:20:59.28
He doesn't even believe that.

279
00:20:59.28 --> 00:21:00.60
But it's, it's pointed out.

280
00:21:00.60 --> 00:21:04.24
And so I brought it up because the contradiction becomes pretty clear or not the contradiction,

281
00:21:04.24 --> 00:21:09.72
but the dichotomy is very clear throughout this book.

282
00:21:09.72 --> 00:21:12.76
So back to the book.

283
00:21:12.76 --> 00:21:17.96
General John A. Lajoon, common don of the core, had come to Haiti on inspection and Lewis

284
00:21:17.96 --> 00:21:20.52
was anxious to see the hero of the fighting in France.

285
00:21:20.52 --> 00:21:25.12
And campus union isn't called the campus union for nothing.

286
00:21:25.12 --> 00:21:30.76
And at this point, Marine Patrol filed pass, and this is a good, another, another good lesson.

287
00:21:30.76 --> 00:21:34.12
They were unshaven and ill-camped.

288
00:21:34.12 --> 00:21:39.44
I'm afraid the men are a little ragged and out of uniform, sir, and the company commander

289
00:21:39.44 --> 00:21:43.16
Clinton said, I'm trying to improve them.

290
00:21:43.16 --> 00:21:48.64
Colonel, I'm a field soldier, Lajoon said, I don't give a damn what men look like in

291
00:21:48.64 --> 00:21:50.04
the field.

292
00:21:50.04 --> 00:21:53.36
Only one thing interests me, and that's ending this war.

293
00:21:53.36 --> 00:21:56.76
Don't waste your time shining them up for jungle work.

294
00:21:56.76 --> 00:22:00.04
Our only objective is success, and I demand that.

295
00:22:00.04 --> 00:22:01.40
So there's a contradiction right there.

296
00:22:01.40 --> 00:22:04.000
Like, well, not a contradiction, but there's the dichotomy.

297
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.88
And he's here now, the other side is here and this from General Lajoon, who's saying, look,

298
00:22:08.88 --> 00:22:10.64
I don't care what these guys look like in the field.

299
00:22:10.64 --> 00:22:12.04
You don't need to polish them up.

300
00:22:12.04 --> 00:22:13.04
They need to win.

301
00:22:13.04 --> 00:22:14.04
They need to be fighting.

302
00:22:14.04 --> 00:22:18.60
And Chesteepolic becomes very famous for the way he appears sometimes in the field.

303
00:22:18.60 --> 00:22:23.88
Meaning he's not exactly spit and polish out there.

304
00:22:23.88 --> 00:22:32.92
He was awarded the Medal military of the Republic of Haiti.

305
00:22:32.92 --> 00:22:39.84
And he did not go unnoticed by his superiors in early in 1921.

306
00:22:39.84 --> 00:22:44.36
He was recommended for a permanent commission in the Marine Corps, whereas rank was now

307
00:22:44.36 --> 00:22:46.36
that of sergeant.

308
00:22:46.36 --> 00:22:52.80
He served as a agent to Colonel Van Degreff, this is another famous Marine.

309
00:22:52.80 --> 00:22:57.16
He again became a second lieutenant, US Marine Corps, but this time is a regular.

310
00:22:57.16 --> 00:23:02.36
I may not have much else to go on, he told a friend, but I have some perseverance.

311
00:23:02.36 --> 00:23:05.04
He had fought in 40 actions.

312
00:23:05.04 --> 00:23:08.12
In Haiti, he developed his instinct.

313
00:23:08.12 --> 00:23:12.32
He developed his instinctive talent for using terrain and battle and learned the lessons

314
00:23:12.32 --> 00:23:13.64
of jungle fighting.

315
00:23:13.64 --> 00:23:19.44
He had become strongly prejudiced against barracks and headquarters soldiers.

316
00:23:19.44 --> 00:23:23.24
Despite his youth, he was one of the most combat officers in the court.

317
00:23:23.24 --> 00:23:27.16
So he got noticed because he did well in combat.

318
00:23:27.16 --> 00:23:33.52
He eventually gets hired on into the Marine Corps as a sergeant.

319
00:23:33.52 --> 00:23:37.32
And then very quickly thereafter goes back to the off-choranks after he's working for

320
00:23:37.32 --> 00:23:38.84
a Colonel Van Degreff.

321
00:23:38.84 --> 00:23:40.48
So there you go.

322
00:23:40.48 --> 00:23:44.08
And you can see he develops his prejudicing, its barracks and headquarters soldiers.

323
00:23:44.08 --> 00:23:50.88
Re-recial on is what we call him.

324
00:23:50.88 --> 00:23:59.76
Now after he came back to the state, he gets chosen to run the Marine Corps drill team,

325
00:23:59.76 --> 00:24:04.000
who has apparently competing and the head had been winning against the Navy and the Army

326
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.48
and the Coast Guard teams.

327
00:24:05.48 --> 00:24:07.24
They've been beating them.

328
00:24:07.24 --> 00:24:08.48
And so he takes over.

329
00:24:08.48 --> 00:24:12.44
So here we go, private Bob Norris, a company clerk drafted for the detachment, shared

330
00:24:12.44 --> 00:24:14.16
the astonishment of his mates.

331
00:24:14.16 --> 00:24:18.84
The lieutenant told us the first day that we would bring home the cup or die trying.

332
00:24:18.84 --> 00:24:21.12
And from the cold eye, he gave us, we believed it.

333
00:24:21.12 --> 00:24:23.68
We found out we found we weren't mistaken.

334
00:24:23.68 --> 00:24:27.24
He took out the silent drill manual and started us from scratch.

335
00:24:27.24 --> 00:24:31.16
He drove us day after day until we figured we'd never lived to see Boston.

336
00:24:31.16 --> 00:24:36.32
When he was through with us, we literally thought as if we had one head instead of 80.

337
00:24:36.32 --> 00:24:40.76
We had somehow, though he was hard as nails, he could be his friendly.

338
00:24:40.76 --> 00:24:44.64
He could be friendly with us like no other officer we'd ever seen.

339
00:24:44.64 --> 00:24:45.64
We gave him all we had.

340
00:24:45.64 --> 00:24:48.64
So there you go, driving people hard, but they love him.

341
00:24:48.64 --> 00:24:50.76
And they love him because he treats him with respect and he's nice to him.

342
00:24:50.76 --> 00:24:52.96
And that's the dichotomy.

343
00:24:52.96 --> 00:24:59.28
And he knows he instinctively how to walk that line in that dichotomy leadership.

344
00:24:59.28 --> 00:25:03.20
Back to the book a few weeks afterwards, Polar was whisked off to his next duty station.

345
00:25:03.20 --> 00:25:07.52
A sign is a flying cadet in Pensacola, Florida, a chance, which he had been pleading

346
00:25:07.52 --> 00:25:10.76
since his first flights and he improvised Jenny Bombered Hayders.

347
00:25:10.76 --> 00:25:16.44
So I didn't cover this part in the book, but when he was in Haiti, he did flights and dropped

348
00:25:16.44 --> 00:25:20.60
grenades on enemy locations and he was into it.

349
00:25:20.60 --> 00:25:27.04
And he gets down to Pensacola and fails his two solo tests.

350
00:25:27.04 --> 00:25:35.68
He left Pensacola disappointed and interestingly, three years after this happened,

351
00:25:35.68 --> 00:25:39.40
he tried to reapply.

352
00:25:39.40 --> 00:25:40.84
And this is an interesting comment.

353
00:25:40.84 --> 00:25:45.04
The medical board in Washington to answer to his plea for one more chance found him physically

354
00:25:45.04 --> 00:25:51.16
fit to fly, but not temperamentally adapted for aviation training.

355
00:25:51.16 --> 00:25:52.16
So that's interesting.

356
00:25:52.16 --> 00:25:57.44
You know, that this guy who's obviously great combat leaders didn't have whatever they were

357
00:25:57.44 --> 00:26:01.40
looking for for flying, he didn't have it.

358
00:26:01.40 --> 00:26:06.68
And he made multiple attempts.

359
00:26:06.68 --> 00:26:11.08
When he went back home for a little while, he went to a dance.

360
00:26:11.08 --> 00:26:17.48
And there's some sort of interesting fact that that's the way they did it back in the

361
00:26:17.48 --> 00:26:18.48
day.

362
00:26:18.48 --> 00:26:24.36
He went to a dance and he met a woman named Virginia Evans.

363
00:26:24.36 --> 00:26:28.44
He danced with her three times with fumbling attempts at conversation during the next

364
00:26:28.44 --> 00:26:29.44
dance.

365
00:26:29.44 --> 00:26:30.44
He made up his mind.

366
00:26:30.44 --> 00:26:34.20
His manner became assured, will you marry me?

367
00:26:34.20 --> 00:26:35.20
She laughed.

368
00:26:35.20 --> 00:26:38.16
Heavens know how can I do that when I haven't even finished the school.

369
00:26:38.16 --> 00:26:40.24
You will.

370
00:26:40.24 --> 00:26:43.92
He spent the night in the stag line watching and dancing with her.

371
00:26:43.92 --> 00:26:47.000
She noticed that he danced with no other girl after that meeting.

372
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:55.24
He did not see her again for almost 11 years, but he never lifted the long range siege.

373
00:26:55.24 --> 00:26:57.52
He gets his mind committed to something.

374
00:26:57.52 --> 00:26:59.96
And Virginia Evans was what he was committed to.

375
00:26:59.96 --> 00:27:05.48
He gets shipped off to Hawaii in July of 1926.

376
00:27:05.48 --> 00:27:07.56
He shows up there.

377
00:27:07.56 --> 00:27:08.88
Another interesting story.

378
00:27:08.88 --> 00:27:11.40
Lewis held firm discipline in his company.

379
00:27:11.40 --> 00:27:16.20
And some men were probably resentful until they learned that he spared himself less than

380
00:27:16.20 --> 00:27:17.20
he did others.

381
00:27:17.20 --> 00:27:21.56
He was ruthless with violators of safety precautions where firearms were involved.

382
00:27:21.56 --> 00:27:25.76
And every time a man shot a weapon on the base without good reason, the fine was automatically

383
00:27:25.76 --> 00:27:26.96
$20.

384
00:27:26.96 --> 00:27:32.36
One day on inspection, Polar saw 45 in the guard house picked it up, released the clip, and

385
00:27:32.36 --> 00:27:34.84
pulled the slide and the trigger.

386
00:27:34.84 --> 00:27:39.16
The gun fired unexpectedly in a bullet furled into the ceiling.

387
00:27:39.16 --> 00:27:43.72
Justi Polar had an AD and accidental discharge.

388
00:27:43.72 --> 00:27:47.12
So he had taken all the precautions except to look in the firing chamber, Polar fined

389
00:27:47.12 --> 00:27:54.84
himself $100, which he gave to the guards to buy beer for a Liberty party.

390
00:27:54.84 --> 00:27:59.80
He bombarded headquarters with police to send him to Nicaragua, where War had broken out.

391
00:27:59.80 --> 00:28:03.64
And Marines were trying to put down a native bandit uprising.

392
00:28:03.64 --> 00:28:08.04
So War is going on in Nicaragua and he says, hey, send me down there.

393
00:28:08.04 --> 00:28:11.52
Back the book, Nicaragua is even more rugged than Haiti than Haiti.

394
00:28:11.52 --> 00:28:16.76
The green rolling country of jungle and planes dominated by towering highlands upon which

395
00:28:16.76 --> 00:28:18.64
were tumbled mountain masses.

396
00:28:18.64 --> 00:28:22.96
For many years, revolutions had torn the land despite the presence of US Marines.

397
00:28:22.96 --> 00:28:26.72
And now a bitter new war had called them back after years absence.

398
00:28:26.72 --> 00:28:32.04
In the North lay an unconquered Indian empire, whose people did not recognize the central

399
00:28:32.04 --> 00:28:33.04
government.

400
00:28:33.04 --> 00:28:39.000
And there, where he moved back and forth across the border of Honduras was the rebel chief.

401
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.16
Augusto, Augusto, Caesar, San Dino.

402
00:28:44.16 --> 00:28:49.08
So that's what's going on in Nicaragua.

403
00:28:49.08 --> 00:28:52.72
Chester Polar shows up reported to General E. R. Biedle.

404
00:28:52.72 --> 00:28:56.20
And he says, I'll give you a company up in the Sago V. S.

405
00:28:56.20 --> 00:28:57.20
In the North.

406
00:28:57.20 --> 00:29:00.72
I understand you like to mix it up.

407
00:29:00.72 --> 00:29:02.12
Big mix up.

408
00:29:02.12 --> 00:29:04.92
Big mix it up.

409
00:29:04.92 --> 00:29:12.32
So this is again, you know, there's so many things that he does that just build this incredible

410
00:29:12.32 --> 00:29:15.08
reputation that he ends up with.

411
00:29:15.08 --> 00:29:16.08
And here's one of them.

412
00:29:16.08 --> 00:29:23.20
The native boss with a fire eating brigand who had been appointed as the local Hefe

413
00:29:23.20 --> 00:29:25.44
Polatico.

414
00:29:25.44 --> 00:29:29.92
Polar invaded his office accompanied by a sergeant and in brief words told the terrorist

415
00:29:29.92 --> 00:29:34.56
that he had come to restore order and that trouble, trouble makers would be would fair

416
00:29:34.56 --> 00:29:35.96
badly.

417
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:37.40
He ended quietly.

418
00:29:37.40 --> 00:29:43.16
You will be held responsible for any further disorder with your life.

419
00:29:43.16 --> 00:29:47.56
As he talked, he saw partially open drawer in the desk before the chief and the butt of

420
00:29:47.56 --> 00:29:48.80
a revolver.

421
00:29:48.80 --> 00:29:52.12
The boss looked as if he wanted to snatch the pistol.

422
00:29:52.12 --> 00:29:54.60
Go ahead, Polar said, use it if you can.

423
00:29:54.60 --> 00:30:00.48
We'll settle this once and for all, you'd better be fast.

424
00:30:00.48 --> 00:30:02.76
Like who does that?

425
00:30:02.76 --> 00:30:04.64
I'll tell you who does that, Chester.

426
00:30:04.64 --> 00:30:07.84
Polar does that.

427
00:30:07.84 --> 00:30:10.44
Polar's career as a guerrilla fighter now opened in earnest.

428
00:30:10.44 --> 00:30:15.72
In February 1930, he was ordered to clear bandits from the area of San Antonio.

429
00:30:15.72 --> 00:30:20.28
Bill Lee, who had earlier served three years in Nicaragua, had been pleading for a chance

430
00:30:20.28 --> 00:30:21.28
to return.

431
00:30:21.28 --> 00:30:27.28
This tall musculoskelet from Massachusetts, who had been 16 years in the corn, was conditioned

432
00:30:27.28 --> 00:30:32.84
by years of playing fullback on the team of a coal burning battle ship and by boxing

433
00:30:32.84 --> 00:30:35.56
and pulling an ore on a crew.

434
00:30:35.56 --> 00:30:42.76
Polar unhesitatingly chose him to help direct company M and Lee and Lewis found Lee, found

435
00:30:42.76 --> 00:30:46.12
Lewis an ideal commander.

436
00:30:46.12 --> 00:30:48.24
This is classic.

437
00:30:48.24 --> 00:30:52.48
This is what Lee says about his commander, which is Chester Polar.

438
00:30:52.48 --> 00:30:54.72
He never really gave me orders.

439
00:30:54.72 --> 00:30:59.40
He just told me what headquarters wanted, asked me if I knew the country, and to get

440
00:30:59.40 --> 00:31:01.84
up the men we needed.

441
00:31:01.84 --> 00:31:06.04
He was a common sense officer, and you always knew where you stood with him.

442
00:31:06.04 --> 00:31:10.96
When he was displeased about something I'd done, he never chewed me out, as so many inexperienced

443
00:31:10.96 --> 00:31:13.12
officers would have done.

444
00:31:13.12 --> 00:31:18.20
He would say, if I'd been doing that, I'd have done it this way.

445
00:31:18.20 --> 00:31:20.08
And that would be the end of it.

446
00:31:20.08 --> 00:31:21.76
We got all my brothers.

447
00:31:21.76 --> 00:31:25.84
Most important of all, he was not green when he first came to Nicaragua, Haiti had taught

448
00:31:25.84 --> 00:31:29.48
him jungle fighting, and he took the new country like an native.

449
00:31:29.48 --> 00:31:36.52
That paragraph right there is just so important, especially again, when people get the

450
00:31:36.52 --> 00:31:41.64
image of a marine and of justi Polar that he's just going to whip everyone into shape.

451
00:31:41.64 --> 00:31:43.96
Like no, that's not a good leader.

452
00:31:43.96 --> 00:31:48.16
That is not a good leader.

453
00:31:48.16 --> 00:31:57.08
Back to the book, General McDougall recommended Polar for a Navy Cross, citing five fights

454
00:31:57.08 --> 00:31:59.76
against, so this is after he's been there for a little while, citing five fights against

455
00:31:59.76 --> 00:32:04.96
a period of numbers without lost to himself, the nine-known enemy dead and numerous, but

456
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:11.76
uncounted wounded, and the impressive loot of munitions, animals, food, and captured military

457
00:32:11.76 --> 00:32:13.40
dispatches.

458
00:32:13.40 --> 00:32:19.92
The recommendation ended thus by his intelligent and forceful leadership without thought

459
00:32:19.92 --> 00:32:25.52
of his own personal safety by great physical exertion and by suffering many hardships,

460
00:32:25.52 --> 00:32:30.96
he surrounded all obstacles and dealt five successive and severe blows against organized

461
00:32:30.96 --> 00:32:34.72
banditry in the Republic of Nicaragua.

462
00:32:34.72 --> 00:32:36.52
So there you go.

463
00:32:36.52 --> 00:32:40.16
That's what he's getting after down in Nicaragua.

464
00:32:40.16 --> 00:32:47.68
Here's another Captain E.E. Linsert, who is the intelligence officer in the Marine Brigade.

465
00:32:47.68 --> 00:32:50.40
He saw that some of the people were jealous.

466
00:32:50.40 --> 00:32:52.84
So he started getting a little bit famous.

467
00:32:52.84 --> 00:32:53.84
People started writing about him.

468
00:32:53.84 --> 00:32:57.60
There was an article in the New York Times about him and people started having some professional

469
00:32:57.60 --> 00:32:59.08
jealousy back to the book.

470
00:32:59.08 --> 00:33:00.68
And this is Lynette talking.

471
00:33:00.68 --> 00:33:05.000
Now and then from New York Times, now and then the New York Times got some of these stories

472
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.28
from Nicaraguan papers and Polar's name became widely known.

473
00:33:09.28 --> 00:33:14.04
A few officers around headquarters who thought of themselves as clouds of its types, muddered

474
00:33:14.04 --> 00:33:17.84
criticisms of Polar and said he was a publicity hound.

475
00:33:17.84 --> 00:33:22.64
I knew that the opposite was true and that Louis spent virtually his whole life in this

476
00:33:22.64 --> 00:33:27.92
period on the trail, deep in enemy country, while our staff officer friends saw sat on

477
00:33:27.92 --> 00:33:33.28
their duffs in the cities far removed from the warfare.

478
00:33:33.28 --> 00:33:34.84
But you get that professional jealousy.

479
00:33:34.84 --> 00:33:38.000
There's a classic example of it.

480
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.64
There's a general Julie and Smith talking about Louis Polar.

481
00:33:42.64 --> 00:33:46.52
He was probably the bravest man I ever knew.

482
00:33:46.52 --> 00:33:49.60
His was a cool courage, not one of desperation.

483
00:33:49.60 --> 00:33:55.52
About the only way to contact the enemy there was to let them ambush him.

484
00:33:55.52 --> 00:33:59.000
He would go anywhere without support knowing that if he got into jam, he had to get

485
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.44
himself out.

486
00:34:00.44 --> 00:34:01.92
He never hesitated.

487
00:34:01.92 --> 00:34:04.44
He invited that kind of work.

488
00:34:04.44 --> 00:34:11.44
He was getting after it.

489
00:34:11.44 --> 00:34:12.72
He went home for a little while.

490
00:34:12.72 --> 00:34:19.32
He visited his younger brother Sam, who was also a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps.

491
00:34:19.32 --> 00:34:25.92
And then Polar landed in one of the army infantry schools.

492
00:34:25.92 --> 00:34:27.56
The army street army's infantry school.

493
00:34:27.56 --> 00:34:31.84
He went to that school while he was there.

494
00:34:31.84 --> 00:34:38.44
Sometimes had some disagreements with the staff.

495
00:34:38.44 --> 00:34:39.44
Here's one.

496
00:34:39.44 --> 00:34:42.48
One lecturer told the students that volume of fire in the field is more important.

497
00:34:42.48 --> 00:34:43.64
The accuracy.

498
00:34:43.64 --> 00:34:45.40
That brought Polar to his feet.

499
00:34:45.40 --> 00:34:47.84
You must have forgotten what happened in the American Revolution.

500
00:34:47.84 --> 00:34:52.96
He said, we won that war with accurate fire when the enemy had all the volume.

501
00:34:52.96 --> 00:34:58.12
It won at King's Mountain and Saratoga and every other battle we won.

502
00:34:58.12 --> 00:35:03.72
Real shooting almost whip the mass firing federal army in the civil war.

503
00:35:03.72 --> 00:35:05.12
It's still like that.

504
00:35:05.12 --> 00:35:08.04
Anywhere I've seen men shooting it out.

505
00:35:08.04 --> 00:35:13.08
You don't hurt them if you don't hit him.

506
00:35:13.08 --> 00:35:16.84
Great point, even though suppressive fires awesome and massive volume of fire definitely

507
00:35:16.84 --> 00:35:18.16
will keep the enemy down.

508
00:35:18.16 --> 00:35:19.16
Heads down.

509
00:35:19.16 --> 00:35:21.48
You gotta hit him.

510
00:35:21.48 --> 00:35:23.88
That's, you know, I've talked about this before.

511
00:35:23.88 --> 00:35:31.000
That's why in Ramadi, our machine gunners were putting scopes on their machine guns.

512
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.40
They're part of partially doing it for to be able to identify who they were looking at.

513
00:35:35.40 --> 00:35:38.48
Positively identify enemy looking for weapons because you got a little magnification on

514
00:35:38.48 --> 00:35:39.48
their scope.

515
00:35:39.48 --> 00:35:41.76
They also wanted to hit what they were shooting at.

516
00:35:41.76 --> 00:35:44.96
Obviously our snipers and riflemen were doing that too.

517
00:35:44.96 --> 00:35:47.60
You gotta hit the bad guys.

518
00:35:47.60 --> 00:35:50.32
Back to the book.

519
00:35:50.32 --> 00:35:54.32
And this huge event is at that school at Fort Benning, Lewis left Benning with many new

520
00:35:54.32 --> 00:35:58.96
friends and all services, but most important carried away a distrust of over-schooling

521
00:35:58.96 --> 00:36:02.96
military men.

522
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:03.96
Here's Polar talking.

523
00:36:03.96 --> 00:36:07.56
The trouble with this school business is that we've taken it too far.

524
00:36:07.56 --> 00:36:12.04
We sit around in classrooms and will the conditions of battle.

525
00:36:12.04 --> 00:36:17.000
Of course, in actual battle, you can't will anything, not a damn thing because the enemy

526
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.40
will do what you don't want them to do or expect them to do almost every time.

527
00:36:22.40 --> 00:36:26.84
Then the results of actual warfare are studied back in the schools, the staff officers and

528
00:36:26.84 --> 00:36:31.88
planners, most of whom have never seen real battles, wonder what went wrong with their

529
00:36:31.88 --> 00:36:34.000
neat plans.

530
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.12
You just simply cannot learn warfare in a school room or anywhere I'll accept in combat.

531
00:36:40.12 --> 00:36:46.96
And you'll never know whether you're fighting man until you're under fire.

532
00:36:46.96 --> 00:36:47.96
Yeah.

533
00:36:47.96 --> 00:36:59.20
He goes back to Nicaragua after that.

534
00:36:59.20 --> 00:37:04.88
Back to the book throughout the latter half of 1932, company M was on unseasing patrol averaging

535
00:37:04.88 --> 00:37:10.08
18 to 20 miles daily on the mountain trails, stretching it some days to as much as 40

536
00:37:10.08 --> 00:37:13.52
miles.

537
00:37:13.52 --> 00:37:18.48
Aller and Lee and their troops marched more than 10,000 miles in the Nicaragua fighting

538
00:37:18.48 --> 00:37:23.60
always on foot for they early discovered that horsemen drew fire in every skirmish.

539
00:37:23.60 --> 00:37:30.44
And so they walked without the mark of officer on their uniforms.

540
00:37:30.44 --> 00:37:34.64
10,000 miles.

541
00:37:34.64 --> 00:37:42.80
On schedule on January 2nd, 1933, the Marines began leaving Nicaragua.

542
00:37:42.80 --> 00:37:54.96
In February 1933, Lewis was introduced to military society and peaking at the US location.

543
00:37:54.96 --> 00:37:58.72
His commander pinned on his chest the star for the Navy Cross.

544
00:37:58.72 --> 00:37:59.72
He'd won a Nicaragua.

545
00:37:59.72 --> 00:38:03.20
So he won another Navy Cross.

546
00:38:03.20 --> 00:38:07.32
Less than a month later, he took over the horse Marines.

547
00:38:07.32 --> 00:38:14.12
Lewis discovered that the 600 man US Marine battalion held only one field exercise each

548
00:38:14.12 --> 00:38:15.12
week.

549
00:38:15.12 --> 00:38:19.96
And this was called off in extreme heat or cold or a dust storm.

550
00:38:19.96 --> 00:38:23.04
But the Japanese did not cancel their training marches for any reason.

551
00:38:23.04 --> 00:38:27.32
He put his horse Marines through their places daily, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, leaving

552
00:38:27.32 --> 00:38:31.56
them on long cross country rides with small dust storms boiling in their wake.

553
00:38:31.56 --> 00:38:35.20
He rode into areas where Japanese were training and effort to observe their details and

554
00:38:35.20 --> 00:38:37.000
attacked the war.

555
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.36
We came out and take over and we're just going to tighten things up a little bit.

556
00:38:40.36 --> 00:38:42.56
One training exercise a month.

557
00:38:42.56 --> 00:38:43.92
No, daily.

558
00:38:43.92 --> 00:38:46.24
We're switching to daily.

559
00:38:46.24 --> 00:38:48.84
Back to the book, Lewis never forgot Virginia Evans.

560
00:38:48.84 --> 00:38:52.96
That was the girl from the dance and faithfully wrote her his experiences in China.

561
00:38:52.96 --> 00:38:57.76
In one letter he wrote so emphatically that you can almost see him blurting out the words

562
00:38:57.76 --> 00:38:59.88
he wanted to hear.

563
00:38:59.88 --> 00:39:02.92
He wanted to say to her.

564
00:39:02.92 --> 00:39:09.48
The deer, even if you do marry me and make me a happy man, even then, if I hear the

565
00:39:09.48 --> 00:39:12.08
beat of the drum, I must leave you.

566
00:39:12.08 --> 00:39:13.68
I want you to know that.

567
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:16.48
Get some.

568
00:39:16.48 --> 00:39:18.40
She's not even married to him yet.

569
00:39:18.40 --> 00:39:20.20
She's not even married to him yet.

570
00:39:20.20 --> 00:39:22.20
And he's like, hey, you know, that's great.

571
00:39:22.20 --> 00:39:24.16
If you marry me and make me happy man, that's awesome.

572
00:39:24.16 --> 00:39:27.44
But if I hear the beat of the drum, I'm out.

573
00:39:27.44 --> 00:39:32.88
I'm going to do what I got to do.

574
00:39:32.88 --> 00:39:39.20
Here's another.

575
00:39:39.20 --> 00:39:40.20
He got in trouble.

576
00:39:40.20 --> 00:39:44.72
He got in trouble a lot because he didn't hold his tongue.

577
00:39:44.72 --> 00:39:48.60
And you're supposed to hold your tongue, right?

578
00:39:48.60 --> 00:39:49.92
And he did.

579
00:39:49.92 --> 00:39:51.88
That's why so many people loved him.

580
00:39:51.88 --> 00:39:53.92
It's also why he got professional jealousy.

581
00:39:53.92 --> 00:39:56.08
And it's also why he got in trouble sometimes.

582
00:39:56.08 --> 00:39:57.68
Here's one example.

583
00:39:57.68 --> 00:40:04.32
Paul was aware of some American military errors on board the Augusta and he never failed

584
00:40:04.32 --> 00:40:07.76
to expose them and talks with his with his sentiments.

585
00:40:07.76 --> 00:40:14.52
Here we have a 10,000 ton heavy cruiser with about 800 men aboard, just one on the

586
00:40:14.52 --> 00:40:17.12
A'sheatic station.

587
00:40:17.12 --> 00:40:20.08
The British have three cruisers on duty here.

588
00:40:20.08 --> 00:40:24.80
You ever notice that we have 37 type writers on this ship?

589
00:40:24.80 --> 00:40:28.48
The British have just one machine on each of their cruisers.

590
00:40:28.48 --> 00:40:30.32
Why do you suppose that is?

591
00:40:30.32 --> 00:40:34.76
You know damn well they don't read all his reports back in Washington when they get there.

592
00:40:34.76 --> 00:40:37.68
Paperwork will ruin any military force.

593
00:40:37.68 --> 00:40:40.76
They should have learned that from smedley butler.

594
00:40:40.76 --> 00:40:45.56
They'll shed this monstrosity when war comes, though, and the fighting people will take

595
00:40:45.56 --> 00:40:51.56
over.

596
00:40:51.56 --> 00:40:55.60
So he doesn't like the paperwork, he doesn't like any, and you can see he does the people

597
00:40:55.60 --> 00:40:57.60
that haven't fought.

598
00:40:57.60 --> 00:40:59.92
That's where he's just talking about people that don't fight.

599
00:40:59.92 --> 00:41:05.000
The people that create paperwork because they don't understand how negative and affects

600
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
everyone.

601
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.28
So they create this stupid paperwork.

602
00:41:10.28 --> 00:41:16.48
And he ends up going to the basic school, which is like the officer with the officers

603
00:41:16.48 --> 00:41:23.96
sort of get trained in all the fundamental principles of combat for the Marine Corps.

604
00:41:23.96 --> 00:41:25.52
And he ended up being instructed there.

605
00:41:25.52 --> 00:41:26.72
Here we go back to the book.

606
00:41:26.72 --> 00:41:32.56
This is coming from a guy named Lou Walte.

607
00:41:32.56 --> 00:41:37.72
Polar was my company commander and to me was the epitome of what the Marine Corps training

608
00:41:37.72 --> 00:41:38.88
should do.

609
00:41:38.88 --> 00:41:44.28
Not only in weapons or classroom or field training, he gave us everything hard at every

610
00:41:44.28 --> 00:41:48.32
break in the field, though he drove us until our tongues were hanging out, men still

611
00:41:48.32 --> 00:41:50.20
gathered around him.

612
00:41:50.20 --> 00:41:55.000
He told us tales about fighting in Haiti and Nicaragua, of his patrols living off the land,

613
00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.36
and fighting natives, all his experiences, not just guff.

614
00:42:00.36 --> 00:42:03.000
Every tale had some point.

615
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.96
Being under Polar in basic school, did more for me than anything I experienced until I got

616
00:42:07.96 --> 00:42:09.88
to Guadalcanal.

617
00:42:09.88 --> 00:42:14.40
He taught us use of terrain like a master, how to use the tiniest bit of covered out

618
00:42:14.40 --> 00:42:18.72
to our advantage, ground form really meant something when he explained it.

619
00:42:18.72 --> 00:42:22.68
He taught us to use the bayonet with all the tricks of close-in fighting.

620
00:42:22.68 --> 00:42:24.20
You couldn't mistake it.

621
00:42:24.20 --> 00:42:26.20
He knew his stuff cold.

622
00:42:26.20 --> 00:42:32.88
So again, classic example of when people think, oh, if I'm nicer and I take it easy

623
00:42:32.88 --> 00:42:34.84
on the truth, they'll like me more.

624
00:42:34.84 --> 00:42:42.08
Wrong answer.

625
00:42:42.08 --> 00:42:46.40
Back to the book on a freezing rain swept day just before Polar's marriage, the class of

626
00:42:46.40 --> 00:42:50.64
1937 had an uncomfortable experience with him on the drill field.

627
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:54.000
They wore nor no overcoats as they marched.

628
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.60
Teeth chattered, but the ranks moved with precision.

629
00:42:57.60 --> 00:43:03.28
Lewis saw stray glances at the barracks detachment, which came out for a brief drill, wrapped

630
00:43:03.28 --> 00:43:06.72
in heavy overcoats and then disappeared.

631
00:43:06.72 --> 00:43:08.36
Those are barracks Marines.

632
00:43:08.36 --> 00:43:13.000
He said with an adjunice voice, you're fighting Marines.

633
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.36
They completed the full schedule for the day, chilled to the bone, and soaking wet.

634
00:43:19.36 --> 00:43:21.60
So legit.

635
00:43:21.60 --> 00:43:27.20
That's it's solid yet.

636
00:43:27.20 --> 00:43:28.40
And he got married.

637
00:43:28.40 --> 00:43:29.40
And here we go.

638
00:43:29.40 --> 00:43:32.92
The Polar's left the pleasant life of Philadelphia Navy Yard in the spring of 1939.

639
00:43:32.92 --> 00:43:33.92
Born for the Orient.

640
00:43:33.92 --> 00:43:37.56
They had a few days in Hawaii and went to Y.K.

641
00:43:37.56 --> 00:43:43.96
One morning to ride surfboards with another young friend, Lieutenant Gordon Warner, a champion

642
00:43:43.96 --> 00:43:47.32
swimmer who had studied under Lewis at the Basics School.

643
00:43:47.32 --> 00:43:50.68
The two men went out to see a canoe into Virginia's astonishment.

644
00:43:50.68 --> 00:43:56.52
Lewis rode in with Wagner balancing with his balancing with skill as rollers hurled them

645
00:43:56.52 --> 00:43:58.64
towards the shore.

646
00:43:58.64 --> 00:44:03.68
Lewis then returned and rode in on a surfboard alone and turned to Virginia.

647
00:44:03.68 --> 00:44:05.76
Come on, you're going to try it too.

648
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:08.60
You never had so much fun.

649
00:44:08.60 --> 00:44:11.000
Chester, pull or get in some of that stoke.

650
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.20
Awesome.

651
00:44:13.20 --> 00:44:17.36
I just had to bring that out, right?

652
00:44:17.36 --> 00:44:24.56
Even Chester, pull or like, there's a little bit of stoke.

653
00:44:24.56 --> 00:44:27.68
Back to the book with a little further delay, Lewis got what he saw from self.

654
00:44:27.68 --> 00:44:31.72
He would report to the new Marine Base in North Carolina, Swamplands at New River where

655
00:44:31.72 --> 00:44:35.000
he would command the first Battalion, 7th Marines and prepare them for war.

656
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.32
So obviously Pearl Harbor takes place and he heads back to the states to take over the

657
00:44:39.32 --> 00:44:41.32
1-7 Marines.

658
00:44:41.32 --> 00:44:47.92
When the Battalion returned from the field late afternoon, Polar called a conference of his

659
00:44:47.92 --> 00:44:49.28
company officers.

660
00:44:49.28 --> 00:44:51.20
Gentlemen, my name's Polar.

661
00:44:51.20 --> 00:44:52.36
Your new commander.

662
00:44:52.36 --> 00:44:54.48
We have a good deal of work to do together.

663
00:44:54.48 --> 00:44:58.60
I'll be slow to make changes, but one of them begins tomorrow.

664
00:44:58.60 --> 00:45:04.20
At the first rest period, after we leave camp, camouflage every man and every piece of equipment.

665
00:45:04.20 --> 00:45:06.92
We've got no camouflage material major?

666
00:45:06.92 --> 00:45:09.20
Well, do it anyways.

667
00:45:09.20 --> 00:45:10.60
The best is in the field.

668
00:45:10.60 --> 00:45:15.20
Find a mud hole, smear mud on your faces and hands, twigs on helmets and blouses anywhere

669
00:45:15.20 --> 00:45:16.40
you can stick them.

670
00:45:16.40 --> 00:45:17.76
Pine foliage is good.

671
00:45:17.76 --> 00:45:20.24
You'll learn.

672
00:45:20.24 --> 00:45:25.04
The Battalion began with marches of 12 miles daily.

673
00:45:25.04 --> 00:45:27.64
This was pushed to 15 and then 20 miles.

674
00:45:27.64 --> 00:45:31.92
Polar punctuated drills with fight talks to his men.

675
00:45:31.92 --> 00:45:33.16
They were very young.

676
00:45:33.16 --> 00:45:37.04
Many them bearded this boys under 16 who must have lied about their ages.

677
00:45:37.04 --> 00:45:39.24
They were the most obscenely profane men.

678
00:45:39.24 --> 00:45:41.88
Polar had ever encountered.

679
00:45:41.88 --> 00:45:46.76
Edward L. Smith, a young battalion doctor, educated at Yale and Harvard, confessed that the

680
00:45:46.76 --> 00:45:54.60
constant flow of filthy language actually second him.

681
00:45:54.60 --> 00:46:00.76
Now we had some guys that were marching and some of them followed fall out from the heat.

682
00:46:00.76 --> 00:46:03.88
And he wrote it and the major polaroid comes by.

683
00:46:03.88 --> 00:46:07.44
When you were marching this morning, I heard a marine on the roadside say, there goes

684
00:46:07.44 --> 00:46:10.04
the goddamn seventh regiment.

685
00:46:10.04 --> 00:46:18.96
I was amazed when you didn't step out of ranks and knock him out cold.

686
00:46:18.96 --> 00:46:23.76
One of his private's Gerald White, a Yale man from Eastport, Maine, also a direst began

687
00:46:23.76 --> 00:46:26.12
to take note of Polar.

688
00:46:26.12 --> 00:46:30.56
He is never obscene, remarkably for the vigor with which he handles us.

689
00:46:30.56 --> 00:46:33.56
He is tough and demands the utmost.

690
00:46:33.56 --> 00:46:37.52
But there is always a kindly approach even when he is chewing you out the displays

691
00:46:37.52 --> 00:46:40.96
of touching sympathy.

692
00:46:40.96 --> 00:46:44.72
Again, this is what we are trying to do as leaders.

693
00:46:44.72 --> 00:46:50.76
Balance that dichotomy.

694
00:46:50.76 --> 00:46:53.92
Here's Polar talking to his troops.

695
00:46:53.92 --> 00:47:00.20
One more thing, whenever we are at Chow, the privates will be fed first, then the non-combs

696
00:47:00.20 --> 00:47:03.40
and officers last of all.

697
00:47:03.40 --> 00:47:06.20
Typical, taking care of the troops.

698
00:47:06.20 --> 00:47:08.20
And they were tough into that.

699
00:47:08.20 --> 00:47:16.64
Oh, this is it when they are doing calistenics in all their marches.

700
00:47:16.64 --> 00:47:18.24
And here we go back to the book.

701
00:47:18.24 --> 00:47:21.68
When they were tough into that, Polar put them through a series of night marches, beginning

702
00:47:21.68 --> 00:47:22.92
after midnight.

703
00:47:22.92 --> 00:47:26.64
The doctors like others learned to read maps and compasses and to handle weapons, including

704
00:47:26.64 --> 00:47:27.64
mortars.

705
00:47:27.64 --> 00:47:32.44
The practice of identifying ships and planes, a joke in most units became a serious business

706
00:47:32.44 --> 00:47:35.40
in 17, some medics learned Morris code.

707
00:47:35.40 --> 00:47:40.92
The Manila John Basilone, an army-trained veteran machine gunner, traded semifur lessons

708
00:47:40.92 --> 00:47:45.24
for instruction in first aid.

709
00:47:45.24 --> 00:47:47.72
Had to bring out the Manila John.

710
00:47:47.72 --> 00:47:55.92
It's like unbelievable man, that this story is just unbelievable.

711
00:47:55.92 --> 00:48:00.32
Here's another very cool situation.

712
00:48:00.32 --> 00:48:06.64
This young lieutenant was practicing some kind of an assault and he gets a little complicated

713
00:48:06.64 --> 00:48:10.64
and Polar calls everyone as old man.

714
00:48:10.64 --> 00:48:13.68
Whether they're old and him or younger, he calls everyone old man, which is pretty funny.

715
00:48:13.68 --> 00:48:14.68
So here we go.

716
00:48:14.68 --> 00:48:15.84
Polar's talking to this young lieutenant.

717
00:48:15.84 --> 00:48:20.12
Old man, there's mighty little room for fancy tactics below division level.

718
00:48:20.12 --> 00:48:21.52
The enemy are on the hill.

719
00:48:21.52 --> 00:48:22.88
You go get him.

720
00:48:22.88 --> 00:48:24.56
In the end, you'll save men.

721
00:48:24.56 --> 00:48:27.44
There are times when you'll have to flank, but don't forget that the shortest distance

722
00:48:27.44 --> 00:48:31.48
between two points is a straight line.

723
00:48:31.48 --> 00:48:35.20
Get some.

724
00:48:35.20 --> 00:48:38.44
I always talk about flanking.

725
00:48:38.44 --> 00:48:40.08
I'm a big believer.

726
00:48:40.08 --> 00:48:44.76
Jesse Polar says, hey, sometimes you got a flank, but sometimes you gotta go get some straight

727
00:48:44.76 --> 00:48:47.76
line.

728
00:48:47.76 --> 00:48:49.32
Here's another important thing.

729
00:48:49.32 --> 00:48:53.72
There's a kernel that's running artillery training and he goes and talks to him.

730
00:48:53.72 --> 00:48:55.92
Colonel, you'll be starting artillery training next week.

731
00:48:55.92 --> 00:48:58.28
I want you to let me know when you'll fire.

732
00:48:58.28 --> 00:49:02.92
I want to get my troops under it as often as I can.

733
00:49:02.92 --> 00:49:06.000
And the Colonel said, there may be accidents.

734
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.96
And Polar says, we can chance those.

735
00:49:07.96 --> 00:49:12.16
What I won't chance is taking a bunch of green kids to war before they know the sound

736
00:49:12.16 --> 00:49:13.92
of big guns.

737
00:49:13.92 --> 00:49:20.28
I know shells aren't the same going in and coming out, but this will help.

738
00:49:20.28 --> 00:49:25.88
So he wanted to get them right there under the sound of the guns.

739
00:49:25.88 --> 00:49:33.000
Lieutenant Cox, now the executive of A company, was impressed by Polar's thoroughness.

740
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.08
Major Polar never stood aside and said carry on sergeant and most of other officers did.

741
00:49:39.08 --> 00:49:41.28
He was in there with us packing all.

742
00:49:41.28 --> 00:49:44.44
He could walk down the best of us, even the kids.

743
00:49:44.44 --> 00:49:54.000
Other commanders rode cars in the woods, but not Polar.

744
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.04
Here's another journal entry.

745
00:49:56.04 --> 00:50:00.12
Private Gerald White wrote for his diary, Polar must have marched twice the distance we

746
00:50:00.12 --> 00:50:01.12
did.

747
00:50:01.12 --> 00:50:05.56
For all day long, he kept marching up and down the column, Johnty as a Bantam Rooster, pipe

748
00:50:05.56 --> 00:50:11.36
clenched in his teeth, ever alert to see that men who were succumbing to the heat, exhaustion

749
00:50:11.36 --> 00:50:14.56
or blisters were taken care of by corpsmen.

750
00:50:14.56 --> 00:50:18.20
Many times today, I saw him take a bar, which is a Browning automatic rifle, a big

751
00:50:18.20 --> 00:50:23.16
machine gun, a bar, machine gun, or mortar off the shoulder of some marine whose fan he

752
00:50:23.16 --> 00:50:30.84
was dragging and carry it to give the poor guy some respite.

753
00:50:30.84 --> 00:50:34.20
Here's another situation again, good dichotomy here.

754
00:50:34.20 --> 00:50:40.04
Somebody, he finds somebody asleep on watch, which by the way, is like incredibly horrible

755
00:50:40.04 --> 00:50:43.000
thing which you can get severely punished for.

756
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.60
Back to the book, Polar shook the boy awake.

757
00:50:44.60 --> 00:50:48.20
Old man, it's dangerous to pull a trick like this.

758
00:50:48.20 --> 00:50:50.16
Suppose Captain Rogers had caught you.

759
00:50:50.16 --> 00:50:53.48
He'd made a big fuss and then I'd have to court marshal you and slap you into the

760
00:50:53.48 --> 00:50:54.80
brick.

761
00:50:54.80 --> 00:50:58.24
Maybe that's what I should do, but I'll give you another chance.

762
00:50:58.24 --> 00:51:04.08
Pretty soon, now we'll be fighting for keeps and you'll stay awake or risk the lives

763
00:51:04.08 --> 00:51:05.40
of every one of us.

764
00:51:05.40 --> 00:51:07.44
You understand me?

765
00:51:07.44 --> 00:51:11.48
So I mean, talk about it way to endure yourself to the troops.

766
00:51:11.48 --> 00:51:13.28
That's so awesome.

767
00:51:13.28 --> 00:51:18.16
Hey, if the Captain would have caught you, then would have been a big fuss.

768
00:51:18.16 --> 00:51:21.20
Luckily I caught you.

769
00:51:21.20 --> 00:51:24.44
Polar was, so they, they deploy overseas.

770
00:51:24.44 --> 00:51:28.52
Polar was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on Samoa.

771
00:51:28.52 --> 00:51:33.12
He wrote to his wife, life is so short.

772
00:51:33.12 --> 00:51:37.64
When I was a child, I thought it would last forever, never.

773
00:51:37.64 --> 00:51:41.80
My love for you will Virginia, even into the next life and then on.

774
00:51:41.80 --> 00:51:44.76
The hardest thing that I've ever done was tell you goodbye.

775
00:51:44.76 --> 00:51:49.76
That was a black Tuesday and I pray that will never be another separation.

776
00:51:49.76 --> 00:51:54.000
Yeah, you're not right.

777
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
You know, they're going, they're heading into a gaudal canal.

778
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.08
So that's going to make everyone think life can get pretty short.

779
00:52:03.08 --> 00:52:07.20
Back to the book, Fire came from the Seaward Japanese ship stood close in, unchallenged

780
00:52:07.20 --> 00:52:08.20
and battered the area.

781
00:52:08.20 --> 00:52:12.16
Much of the grove was combed by flying fragments and men screamed in agony.

782
00:52:12.16 --> 00:52:18.60
These were torn and broken and many tumble to the ground.

783
00:52:18.60 --> 00:52:22.84
People reported hearing general polar or at this time Colonel polar.

784
00:52:22.84 --> 00:52:23.84
It's all right, men.

785
00:52:23.84 --> 00:52:25.60
Stayed down and they can't hurt you.

786
00:52:25.60 --> 00:52:28.56
This one last forever tomorrow will be our turn.

787
00:52:28.56 --> 00:52:35.56
So they're just getting, they landed on the beach and they're just getting hammered with

788
00:52:35.56 --> 00:52:41.48
a jab from Japanese ships, big artillery from the big naval guns.

789
00:52:41.48 --> 00:52:47.96
The battalion left that left the perimeter that afternoon, a file of more than 800 men.

790
00:52:47.96 --> 00:52:51.96
The tail of the battalion had hardly cleared the perimeter when they were firing ahead.

791
00:52:51.96 --> 00:52:54.36
Captain Hayes was near the Colonel at the moment.

792
00:52:54.36 --> 00:52:58.000
Every man hit the deck except polar.

793
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.56
We dive for the growth beside the trail, but he walked up and down the line, talking

794
00:53:01.56 --> 00:53:03.72
is if he were on parade.

795
00:53:03.72 --> 00:53:07.56
He told us it was all right and this was nothing to worry about just small stuff.

796
00:53:07.56 --> 00:53:09.40
We began to get up again.

797
00:53:09.40 --> 00:53:15.52
Then in there he commanded that battalion as it never imagined it could be commanded.

798
00:53:15.52 --> 00:53:21.96
The men saw what kind of man they had and the word went down the column as fast as light.

799
00:53:21.96 --> 00:53:26.76
We lost our fear or some of it.

800
00:53:26.76 --> 00:53:31.000
On a grassy null above the tangle where the night's bivouac was planned, the column

801
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:38.68
met an ambush, two bobhaggries, platoon were killed, two bobhaggries, platoon were killed,

802
00:53:38.68 --> 00:53:42.80
and the unit broken to tiny groups leaving Haggry without a command.

803
00:53:42.80 --> 00:53:44.60
He lane-covered and watched polar.

804
00:53:44.60 --> 00:53:55.12
It was the greatest exhibition of utter disregard for personal safety I ever saw.

805
00:53:55.12 --> 00:54:02.08
He definitely, like I said, whatever that officer was in Haiti that told them don't show

806
00:54:02.08 --> 00:54:07.96
fear under fire, he took that one to the bank.

807
00:54:07.96 --> 00:54:12.56
Back to the book, a runner just began jumping around just from different combat scenarios.

808
00:54:12.56 --> 00:54:15.80
A runner just behind polar was hit in the throat and died quickly.

809
00:54:15.80 --> 00:54:18.28
Everyone else hit the ground except for Colonel Polar.

810
00:54:18.28 --> 00:54:21.20
First Sergeant William Pennington retained a vivid memory of the moment.

811
00:54:21.20 --> 00:54:25.48
Colonel stood there in that grazing fire with that little old stump of a pipe in his face,

812
00:54:25.48 --> 00:54:28.44
yelling B company second-pultoon in line here.

813
00:54:28.44 --> 00:54:32.32
Machine gun fire kicked up dust all around me and I stayed down in that knee high-cune

814
00:54:32.32 --> 00:54:35.12
I grass like everyone else in the ranks.

815
00:54:35.12 --> 00:54:41.88
He was the only Marine you could see standing on that hillside.

816
00:54:41.88 --> 00:54:42.88
Get this.

817
00:54:42.88 --> 00:54:43.88
Here we go.

818
00:54:43.88 --> 00:54:46.28
A grenade fell near the old man.

819
00:54:46.28 --> 00:54:48.36
No more than eight yards away.

820
00:54:48.36 --> 00:54:54.36
Nothing Captain Zach Cox estimated, but Polar turned when he saw a company scatter and

821
00:54:54.36 --> 00:54:59.48
yelled, oh that damn thing ain't going off.

822
00:54:59.48 --> 00:55:01.48
It helped the steady the men.

823
00:55:01.48 --> 00:55:05.96
The grenade was a dud.

824
00:55:05.96 --> 00:55:09.48
Yeah.

825
00:55:09.48 --> 00:55:10.48
So they get done.

826
00:55:10.48 --> 00:55:13.56
They're kind of like a situation.

827
00:55:13.56 --> 00:55:15.24
First few days of fighting back the book.

828
00:55:15.24 --> 00:55:18.12
Polar's battalion had 24 dead and 23 wounded.

829
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:23.40
The next day back in the main defense line of the perimeter he called together the

830
00:55:23.40 --> 00:55:24.88
battalion officers.

831
00:55:24.88 --> 00:55:28.000
His voice was hard and his face unsmiling.

832
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.32
Gentlemen, at least we've all been blooded now.

833
00:55:31.32 --> 00:55:35.64
I don't want you to be moaning over our losses and feeling sorry for yourselves or taking

834
00:55:35.64 --> 00:55:38.36
all the blame on your shoulders.

835
00:55:38.36 --> 00:55:41.16
We've all got to leave this world someday.

836
00:55:41.16 --> 00:55:43.20
We're all in the same pickle.

837
00:55:43.20 --> 00:55:46.64
And there are worse things than dying for your country.

838
00:55:46.64 --> 00:55:50.60
Some things about our action in the last four days I want you to remember forever.

839
00:55:50.60 --> 00:55:57.52
There are some we'd all like to forget, but they'll be in your mind's eye as long as you live.

840
00:55:57.52 --> 00:55:59.52
I hope we've all learned something.

841
00:55:59.52 --> 00:56:02.68
Now take care of your men and make yourselves ready.

842
00:56:02.68 --> 00:56:06.000
We haven't seen anything yet.

843
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.28
One other thing, back there on the hillside at Mount Austin, I had trouble getting company

844
00:56:10.28 --> 00:56:12.20
officers up.

845
00:56:12.20 --> 00:56:15.64
I hope you saw that cost us casualties.

846
00:56:15.64 --> 00:56:18.08
Never do I want to see that again in my command.

847
00:56:18.08 --> 00:56:21.16
I want to see officers leading.

848
00:56:21.16 --> 00:56:24.92
I want you to know that your leaders and not simply commanders.

849
00:56:24.92 --> 00:56:31.84
You cannot operate a military force in the field under these conditions with commanders alone.

850
00:56:31.84 --> 00:56:35.52
Civilians wouldn't know what I was talking about, but you've found out now that it's true.

851
00:56:35.52 --> 00:56:39.68
There aren't many qualities in a man, but one that is absolutely necessary in an infantry

852
00:56:39.68 --> 00:56:41.68
leader is stark courage.

853
00:56:41.68 --> 00:56:46.24
Give that idea to your men in your own way.

854
00:56:46.24 --> 00:56:50.92
Don't worry over the things that are done that we can no longer help.

855
00:56:50.92 --> 00:56:57.60
Concentrate on building a better combat unit because that's the best hope of all of us surviving.

856
00:56:57.60 --> 00:57:00.92
None of us could help the fact that I was the only combat trained man in our outfit when

857
00:57:00.92 --> 00:57:01.92
we began.

858
00:57:01.92 --> 00:57:05.08
I was lucky enough to get the joke when I was young.

859
00:57:05.08 --> 00:57:08.40
You'll come along fast and they'll be worked for us.

860
00:57:08.40 --> 00:57:14.72
That's be ready when our time comes.

861
00:57:14.72 --> 00:57:18.48
Yeah, that's, that's, I haven't really heard that point, but you know what you knew here

862
00:57:18.48 --> 00:57:24.36
people talk about leaders and managers and I've worked with companies and it's a good,

863
00:57:24.36 --> 00:57:25.92
a good sentiment, right?

864
00:57:25.92 --> 00:57:28.36
Hey, our leaders are leaders, our leaders are leaders.

865
00:57:28.36 --> 00:57:29.36
They're not managers.

866
00:57:29.36 --> 00:57:33.04
Well, this is an interesting one of saying, look, it's not commanders.

867
00:57:33.04 --> 00:57:34.04
Leaders, not commanders.

868
00:57:34.04 --> 00:57:35.04
Yeah.

869
00:57:35.04 --> 00:57:37.48
And if you think about the difference between commanders, me and I'm going to command you.

870
00:57:37.48 --> 00:57:39.48
You know, leaders are going to lead.

871
00:57:39.48 --> 00:57:48.36
The very, very cool distinction between those two words.

872
00:57:48.36 --> 00:57:52.56
Back to the book, he still missed nothing involving the morale of his men.

873
00:57:52.56 --> 00:57:56.96
Reagan Fuller, who began to feel the stark drama of the situation after the first severe

874
00:57:56.96 --> 00:58:01.000
fight grew a beard and swaggered around the perimeter like a desparado.

875
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Puller took him aside.

876
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.16
Oh, man, you're carried away with this war business.

877
00:58:06.16 --> 00:58:07.96
You're feeling too self-important about it.

878
00:58:07.96 --> 00:58:09.36
That's dangerous.

879
00:58:09.36 --> 00:58:12.16
This is just a matter of killer be killed.

880
00:58:12.16 --> 00:58:14.68
I got to read that again.

881
00:58:14.68 --> 00:58:18.72
This is just a matter of kill or be killed.

882
00:58:18.72 --> 00:58:22.08
And we've got to stay on our toes to have a chance.

883
00:58:22.08 --> 00:58:23.08
Clean yourself up.

884
00:58:23.08 --> 00:58:24.72
Here's some shaving gear.

885
00:58:24.72 --> 00:58:32.72
And when you're through, you can take a drink from that bottle if you like.

886
00:58:32.72 --> 00:58:40.56
Again, connecting with your troops and recognizing that a guy is starting to go sideways

887
00:58:40.56 --> 00:58:45.56
a little bit and pulling him aside and talking to him.

888
00:58:45.56 --> 00:58:46.80
All right.

889
00:58:46.80 --> 00:58:51.36
Now, again, they're just engaged in a fierce battle at this point back to the book at

890
00:58:51.36 --> 00:58:52.36
the peak of this.

891
00:58:52.36 --> 00:58:55.96
Pollard had a telephone call from the regimental commander in the rear.

892
00:58:55.96 --> 00:58:57.52
Pollard, we've got to change in orders.

893
00:58:57.52 --> 00:59:01.72
Execute the reconnaissance and force with your battalion along the coast road.

894
00:59:01.72 --> 00:59:04.000
Do not become involved in a large action.

895
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.80
Be prepared to withdraw to maintain communications.

896
00:59:07.80 --> 00:59:10.000
Reagan Fuller was within the air shot of Polar.

897
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.36
As Polar shouted in rage, how the hell can I make a reconnaissance when we're engaged

898
00:59:14.36 --> 00:59:15.80
down to the last man?

899
00:59:15.80 --> 00:59:17.40
We're fighting tooth and nail man.

900
00:59:17.40 --> 00:59:26.24
If you'd get off your duff and come up here where the fighting is, you could see the situation.

901
00:59:26.24 --> 00:59:27.24
Boom.

902
00:59:27.24 --> 00:59:31.64
Again, this is why he wasn't always super popular up the chain of

903
00:59:31.64 --> 00:59:36.44
command because he spoke the truth.

904
00:59:36.44 --> 00:59:41.32
Sometimes in the most, not the most tactful way.

905
00:59:41.32 --> 00:59:47.80
Now, Polar's battalion actually ends up getting the upper hand there and he gets them

906
00:59:47.80 --> 00:59:53.08
kind of pinned down in crushes.

907
00:59:53.08 --> 00:59:54.08
Back to the book.

908
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:57.64
When it was over, the regimental headquarters called back, relieving Polar of any necessity

909
00:59:57.64 --> 01:00:01.80
of a reconnaissance patrol and permitting him to return to the perimeter.

910
01:00:01.80 --> 01:00:06.12
There was also a call from Hanukkah and a request to bring back his wounded.

911
01:00:06.12 --> 01:00:10.28
Polar's men carried in all casualties from the two battalions.

912
01:00:10.28 --> 01:00:11.28
Two battalions.

913
01:00:11.28 --> 01:00:14.08
Polar's battalion had five dead and 21 wounded.

914
01:00:14.08 --> 01:00:18.60
Total losses were 65 dead and 125 wounded for the operation.

915
01:00:18.60 --> 01:00:23.000
Polar estimated that the enemy losses to be at least five times that.

916
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.96
And it was later revealed that the Japanese fourth infantry had lost almost an entire battalion

917
01:00:27.96 --> 01:00:34.28
with 690 dead, the result of Polar's strike in the crater.

918
01:00:34.28 --> 01:00:43.04
Now, like I said, he speaks his mind and remember, I mentioned Colonel Vandagreff, who

919
01:00:43.04 --> 01:00:44.56
he worked for when he was a young lieutenant.

920
01:00:44.56 --> 01:00:49.92
Well, now Colonel Vandagreff is a general and general Vandagreff, they're having a little

921
01:00:49.92 --> 01:00:51.64
conversation.

922
01:00:51.64 --> 01:00:54.32
Back to the book, the whole process was assinined.

923
01:00:54.32 --> 01:00:58.12
They mixed up outfits as badly as they possibly could.

924
01:00:58.12 --> 01:01:00.36
There was no overall commander.

925
01:01:00.36 --> 01:01:04.000
Division gave orders to Hanukkah and Wailing and Me.

926
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.40
Wailing was senior, but orders did not come through him.

927
01:01:06.40 --> 01:01:09.40
My regimental commander was behind the river and not on scene.

928
01:01:09.40 --> 01:01:13.12
Thus, when they found two battalions stopped cold in the fight, communications were so

929
01:01:13.12 --> 01:01:17.32
bad they pulled these two outfits and left me to face all the enemy.

930
01:01:17.32 --> 01:01:19.88
We were blind lucky to come out as we did.

931
01:01:19.88 --> 01:01:24.28
Imagine them ordering me to go on some damn reconnaissance when I was fighting with every

932
01:01:24.28 --> 01:01:25.96
man I had.

933
01:01:25.96 --> 01:01:29.92
Proper designation of authority would have made everything clear.

934
01:01:29.92 --> 01:01:30.92
Boom.

935
01:01:30.92 --> 01:01:33.88
There you go.

936
01:01:33.88 --> 01:01:36.44
Proper designation of authority.

937
01:01:36.44 --> 01:01:37.88
People need to know who's in charge.

938
01:01:37.88 --> 01:01:39.80
And you need to put someone in charge.

939
01:01:39.80 --> 01:01:42.000
That's the way it's got to work.

940
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
When you don't have that, you get confused and you get issues.

941
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.44
Now there's like a field doctor there.

942
01:01:50.44 --> 01:01:55.16
Dr. Smith noted in his diary that Polar seemed more concerned over losses.

943
01:01:55.16 --> 01:01:59.32
He has become almost fanatical in his desire to see that men are properly cared for.

944
01:01:59.32 --> 01:02:03.44
If a man's body is lost, he is greatly disturbed and frets about the time lost before

945
01:02:03.44 --> 01:02:10.88
he can recover the body and give it a decent burial.

946
01:02:10.88 --> 01:02:13.56
There you go.

947
01:02:13.56 --> 01:02:16.08
There was one unpleasant matter.

948
01:02:16.08 --> 01:02:20.48
The young Philadelphia who had earlier been a disciplinary problem on Samoa had failed

949
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:22.96
the Colonel on the crater march.

950
01:02:22.96 --> 01:02:24.60
Polar called Jim Hayes the legal officer.

951
01:02:24.60 --> 01:02:28.28
I want you to have her tried for dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy.

952
01:02:28.28 --> 01:02:32.16
He threw away his load of mortar shells because it was too heavy and he cost me the lives

953
01:02:32.16 --> 01:02:35.72
of several men damn his time.

954
01:02:35.72 --> 01:02:37.16
I'll draw a recommendation.

955
01:02:37.16 --> 01:02:42.16
I'm going to have him shot.

956
01:02:42.16 --> 01:02:48.92
I don't think I covered it.

957
01:02:48.92 --> 01:02:53.96
The reason I pointed that out is because that guy redeems himself in the future.

958
01:02:53.96 --> 01:02:58.64
It's one of the times where Polar says, okay, you're good.

959
01:02:58.64 --> 01:03:01.48
He does some incredibly brave and crazy things.

960
01:03:01.48 --> 01:03:04.04
Here we go back to the book.

961
01:03:04.04 --> 01:03:14.36
The major Japanese attack was expected along the mat and cow in most of the division strength

962
01:03:14.36 --> 01:03:15.36
was placed there.

963
01:03:15.36 --> 01:03:22.28
The Japanese move to attack these positions on October 15th with the second division,

964
01:03:22.28 --> 01:03:26.40
assigned to swing far inland and hit the Marines from the south in an area where Polar's

965
01:03:26.40 --> 01:03:27.40
men awaited.

966
01:03:27.40 --> 01:03:32.20
Nine infantry battalion set out on this march total of 5,600 men excluding artillery

967
01:03:32.20 --> 01:03:33.60
and other support troops.

968
01:03:33.60 --> 01:03:37.64
The soldiers carried or dragged everything, even guns over the rough trails.

969
01:03:37.64 --> 01:03:40.16
They were late in making their attack and abandoned many guns on the trail.

970
01:03:40.16 --> 01:03:45.68
So the Japanese are coming in there, coming aggressively.

971
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:50.24
A company was weaker by one platoon than the other companies for despite protests of

972
01:03:50.24 --> 01:03:51.72
Conner Polar.

973
01:03:51.72 --> 01:03:57.12
There was an outpost of 46 of its men, some 3,000 yards to their front, commanded by

974
01:03:57.12 --> 01:04:01.32
Sergeant Ralph Briggs Jr., a fort Edward's Wisconsin.

975
01:04:01.32 --> 01:04:04.64
These men have been out for several days to warn of an enemy approach.

976
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:08.28
Colonel Polar was on the field phone during the day of digging in, trying to persuade

977
01:04:08.28 --> 01:04:12.56
his regimental commander to have headquarters with draw, bricks and his patrol.

978
01:04:12.56 --> 01:04:15.72
But going to sacrifice those men, that's all.

979
01:04:15.72 --> 01:04:17.80
We don't need any bait on the hook as you say.

980
01:04:17.80 --> 01:04:19.24
If they're coming, they're coming.

981
01:04:19.24 --> 01:04:24.64
This is foolishness to throw away that platoon and they do a great job in the mini-series,

982
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:27.52
the Pacific of kind of showing this.

983
01:04:27.52 --> 01:04:31.44
And if you ever watch the Pacific, I mean, just watch it, watch it about 10 times.

984
01:04:31.44 --> 01:04:35.88
I've probably watched it in 20 times.

985
01:04:35.88 --> 01:04:39.28
And he tries to keep them as safe as he can.

986
01:04:39.28 --> 01:04:40.28
Back to the book.

987
01:04:40.28 --> 01:04:41.48
All righty said, let's get this straight.

988
01:04:41.48 --> 01:04:44.28
Hold your hold fire until you get an order for me.

989
01:04:44.28 --> 01:04:46.96
The outpost must get clear before we open up.

990
01:04:46.96 --> 01:04:51.28
If the bastard's breakthrough, use the bayonet and keep someone at every phone.

991
01:04:51.28 --> 01:04:52.28
Wait.

992
01:04:52.28 --> 01:04:57.96
Puller looked at his watch. It was 10 o'clock. Yells rolled from the right.

993
01:04:57.96 --> 01:05:01.32
Japanese voices shouting in English, blood for the emperor.

994
01:05:01.32 --> 01:05:02.32
Marine you die.

995
01:05:02.32 --> 01:05:09.28
A Marine bellowed back to hell with your goddamn emperor.

996
01:05:09.28 --> 01:05:13.60
Sergeant Manila John Boselon's nest of guns is about the center of sea company in the

997
01:05:13.60 --> 01:05:16.56
middle of the line with a slight decline in his front.

998
01:05:16.56 --> 01:05:21.60
The enemy drove toward him so persistently that he covered the hill with their bodies.

999
01:05:21.60 --> 01:05:27.48
And when the first fury of attack faded, he sent men to push down the wall of enemy bodies

1000
01:05:27.48 --> 01:05:32.08
to clear the fire lane.

1001
01:05:32.08 --> 01:05:36.28
Of course, that's John Baselon who is awarded the Medal of Honor for those actions that

1002
01:05:36.28 --> 01:05:39.12
night.

1003
01:05:39.12 --> 01:05:46.12
Now there's a artillery commander, a little bit to the rear named Devol.

1004
01:05:46.12 --> 01:05:52.28
And Polar is asking Devol for massive artillery support because they're like going to

1005
01:05:52.28 --> 01:05:53.28
be overrun.

1006
01:05:53.28 --> 01:05:56.08
Polar called the Valle again, give us all you've got.

1007
01:05:56.08 --> 01:05:57.80
We're holding on by our toenails.

1008
01:05:57.80 --> 01:06:01.96
I'll give you all you call for Polar, but God knows what will happen when this ammo we

1009
01:06:01.96 --> 01:06:03.36
have is gone.

1010
01:06:03.36 --> 01:06:05.96
If we don't need it now, we'll never need it.

1011
01:06:05.96 --> 01:06:10.56
If they get through here tonight, there won't be a tomorrow.

1012
01:06:10.56 --> 01:06:12.60
That's a situation that they were in.

1013
01:06:12.60 --> 01:06:16.84
They can follow or call from the CP from the flank, Colonel, I'm just about running out of

1014
01:06:16.84 --> 01:06:17.84
ammo.

1015
01:06:17.84 --> 01:06:20.04
I've used almost three and a half units of fire.

1016
01:06:20.04 --> 01:06:21.84
You got bayonets, haven't you?

1017
01:06:21.84 --> 01:06:22.84
Fuller?

1018
01:06:22.84 --> 01:06:23.84
Sure.

1019
01:06:23.84 --> 01:06:24.84
Yes, sir.

1020
01:06:24.84 --> 01:06:25.84
All right, then.

1021
01:06:25.84 --> 01:06:26.84
Hang on.

1022
01:06:26.84 --> 01:06:32.20
And the heaviest of the firing when Polar left the CP, Regimental headquarters called for

1023
01:06:32.20 --> 01:06:33.20
him.

1024
01:06:33.20 --> 01:06:34.48
Not here, sir, the wireman said.

1025
01:06:34.48 --> 01:06:36.04
Colonel Polar's up front.

1026
01:06:36.04 --> 01:06:37.84
Find him, get him on the phone.

1027
01:06:37.84 --> 01:06:41.24
After the crew had made several calls to the line position, Polar returned and talked to

1028
01:06:41.24 --> 01:06:46.000
Regimental Commander, the few remaining in the pit heard Polar's explosive reply.

1029
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.48
What do you mean what's going on?

1030
01:06:47.48 --> 01:06:51.88
We're neck deep in a firefight and have no time standing here, bull flinging.

1031
01:06:51.88 --> 01:07:00.76
If you want to find out what's going on, come up and see.

1032
01:07:00.76 --> 01:07:03.16
He was that good.

1033
01:07:03.16 --> 01:07:04.76
He was that good.

1034
01:07:04.76 --> 01:07:07.92
That he was able to do that.

1035
01:07:07.92 --> 01:07:11.12
You know, it's kind of like when Remo and I was talking about Steve Jobs, a couple podcasts

1036
01:07:11.12 --> 01:07:12.12
going on.

1037
01:07:12.12 --> 01:07:14.000
I was like, hey, look, he was a, he was not a good leader.

1038
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.96
He was abusive and he was, but he was so good at his other skills.

1039
01:07:18.96 --> 01:07:22.68
Well, he, Polar's such a great leader down the chain of command.

1040
01:07:22.68 --> 01:07:28.60
And he's such a great tactician and he's so brave and so, do, do dominant on the battlefield.

1041
01:07:28.60 --> 01:07:31.56
Then he does this stuff and like basically gets away with it.

1042
01:07:31.56 --> 01:07:32.56
Yeah.

1043
01:07:32.56 --> 01:07:33.56
Yeah.

1044
01:07:33.56 --> 01:07:36.56
Back to the book.

1045
01:07:36.56 --> 01:07:41.04
There was one enemy prisoner, a little sullen war officer who refused to talk when

1046
01:07:41.04 --> 01:07:42.80
he was brought to Polar.

1047
01:07:42.80 --> 01:07:47.28
The Colonel was so stung by the insolence of the prisoner that he slapped him with a flat

1048
01:07:47.28 --> 01:07:49.08
end of an entrenching tool.

1049
01:07:49.08 --> 01:07:51.96
Teeth spilled from the Japs mouth, but they were false teeth.

1050
01:07:51.96 --> 01:07:54.92
He gave no information, even then.

1051
01:07:54.92 --> 01:08:01.32
A later prisoner talked freely with Polar and Polar asked him, why didn't you change your

1052
01:08:01.32 --> 01:08:03.76
tactics when you saw you weren't breaking our line?

1053
01:08:03.76 --> 01:08:06.52
Why didn't you shift to a weaker spot?

1054
01:08:06.52 --> 01:08:08.44
That is not the Japanese way.

1055
01:08:08.44 --> 01:08:09.96
The plan had been made.

1056
01:08:09.96 --> 01:08:12.20
No one would have dared to change it.

1057
01:08:12.20 --> 01:08:15.16
It must go as it is written.

1058
01:08:15.16 --> 01:08:19.48
That's why we have decentralized commands.

1059
01:08:19.48 --> 01:08:21.04
That's the opposite of decentralized command.

1060
01:08:21.04 --> 01:08:22.64
That's called centralized command.

1061
01:08:22.64 --> 01:08:23.64
Here's the plan.

1062
01:08:23.64 --> 01:08:24.96
This is what you will execute.

1063
01:08:24.96 --> 01:08:30.84
Don't do anything different.

1064
01:08:30.84 --> 01:08:31.84
Back to the book.

1065
01:08:31.84 --> 01:08:33.68
And this is kind of after this thing settled down.

1066
01:08:33.68 --> 01:08:34.68
That's why they have prisoners.

1067
01:08:34.68 --> 01:08:35.68
That's why he's doing interrogation.

1068
01:08:35.68 --> 01:08:39.20
That's why he's asking why didn't you change your tactics when you broke the line.

1069
01:08:39.20 --> 01:08:40.20
Back to the book.

1070
01:08:40.20 --> 01:08:44.92
Polars, Polars men found 250 Japanese dead inside their lines during the day.

1071
01:08:44.92 --> 01:08:49.32
About 25 of them officers who want to major who had committed suicide, leaving a final entry

1072
01:08:49.32 --> 01:08:53.76
in his diary on the loss of his colors and troops.

1073
01:08:53.76 --> 01:08:55.72
I do not know what excuse to give.

1074
01:08:55.72 --> 01:08:57.60
I apologize for what I have done.

1075
01:08:57.60 --> 01:09:01.52
I am going to return my borrowed life today with short interest.

1076
01:09:01.52 --> 01:09:07.68
Yeah, I thought that that was worth bringing up because you always hear about the fanaticism

1077
01:09:07.68 --> 01:09:09.68
of the Japanese, but there you go.

1078
01:09:09.68 --> 01:09:10.68
That's it.

1079
01:09:10.68 --> 01:09:12.68
I apologize.

1080
01:09:12.68 --> 01:09:18.04
And I'm going to kill myself because I didn't succeed in my mission.

1081
01:09:18.04 --> 01:09:23.92
Polars casualties for the battle were 1930 wounded and 12 missing.

1082
01:09:23.92 --> 01:09:29.16
Two or three days later when the stench of bloated bodies in his front made his men

1083
01:09:29.16 --> 01:09:35.92
wretch, Polar persuaded division to make count of the enemy casualties and bury the corpses.

1084
01:09:35.92 --> 01:09:42.76
This burial detail counted 1,462 bodies and spent two days in the grizzly work.

1085
01:09:42.76 --> 01:09:47.04
Bulldozers, ground, gouge holes and covered the enemy dead in great pits.

1086
01:09:47.04 --> 01:09:50.44
So that's incredible.

1087
01:09:50.44 --> 01:09:51.44
Incredible.

1088
01:09:51.44 --> 01:09:56.84
That killed ratio.

1089
01:09:56.84 --> 01:10:01.28
The Colonel washed in the river with the troops and Reagan Fuller noticed that even

1090
01:10:01.28 --> 01:10:05.24
when he washed his uniforms, he stripped with the enlisted men in the river.

1091
01:10:05.24 --> 01:10:10.36
A common touch the men liked Fuller said, though a few of the clouds were its type officers

1092
01:10:10.36 --> 01:10:14.72
in the rear-ranked Snickard behind his back, the men knew he was real.

1093
01:10:14.72 --> 01:10:22.72
That he never put on an act and they loved him.

1094
01:10:22.72 --> 01:10:24.32
And again, here's the dichotomy of it.

1095
01:10:24.32 --> 01:10:27.08
We know what a hard ass he is.

1096
01:10:27.08 --> 01:10:31.44
Back to the book, Polar Shield is shielded as men from unnecessary work.

1097
01:10:31.44 --> 01:10:36.24
A young officer who insisted that they police up the batagon area, removing jab beer cans

1098
01:10:36.24 --> 01:10:40.000
and the debris of the battle was stopped by the Colonel.

1099
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.32
Forget it old man.

1100
01:10:41.32 --> 01:10:44.000
Let the boys get in their sacks and leave them the hell alone.

1101
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.08
They're half dead from fever and fighting and they'll have to hop to it again any day now.

1102
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:51.56
So there you go.

1103
01:10:51.56 --> 01:10:59.68
That's the act like he just nails that he's perfect.

1104
01:10:59.68 --> 01:11:04.40
Another situation, Polar was 300 to 400 yards behind the point of his column.

1105
01:11:04.40 --> 01:11:08.52
The first salvo of Japanese fire burst just in front of him.

1106
01:11:08.52 --> 01:11:13.72
For the first time in his combat career, spanning 23 years, his luck ran out under enemy

1107
01:11:13.72 --> 01:11:14.72
fire.

1108
01:11:14.72 --> 01:11:17.96
He was blown from his feet by a spray of flying metal.

1109
01:11:17.96 --> 01:11:22.92
Michelle fragments his torn his legs and lower body and he was bleeding freely.

1110
01:11:22.92 --> 01:11:26.20
The field telephone was carried by a Marine just in his rear.

1111
01:11:26.20 --> 01:11:28.000
Call had quarters old man.

1112
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.52
Polar said, I can't serve the wires been cut.

1113
01:11:31.52 --> 01:11:35.96
The Colonel struggled unsteadily to his feet and tried to help the communications man repair

1114
01:11:35.96 --> 01:11:37.40
the wire.

1115
01:11:37.40 --> 01:11:41.60
As he stood an enemy sniper shot, an enemy sniper shot him twice through the flesh

1116
01:11:41.60 --> 01:11:43.96
of his arm with a small caliber bullets.

1117
01:11:43.96 --> 01:11:46.28
He sank back to the ground.

1118
01:11:46.28 --> 01:11:50.20
The target, pending to him, come up by now and he helped Shepard lift Polar into a

1119
01:11:50.20 --> 01:11:55.88
poncho and get him off the ground to avoid tetanus infection.

1120
01:11:55.88 --> 01:11:57.12
Shepard bent over Polar.

1121
01:11:57.12 --> 01:11:58.96
Are you able to stay in command sir?

1122
01:11:58.96 --> 01:12:00.48
Yes, of course I am.

1123
01:12:00.48 --> 01:12:01.48
I'll be okay.

1124
01:12:01.48 --> 01:12:03.52
I can't leave these men.

1125
01:12:03.52 --> 01:12:06.52
May I call for artillery fire if I can get ready or phone working?

1126
01:12:06.52 --> 01:12:08.80
Yes, if you know how.

1127
01:12:08.80 --> 01:12:14.000
Men shoveled out a fox hole for Polar and lowered him into the poncho.

1128
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.68
The telephone is placed in the hole with him and when the line was repaired he cradled

1129
01:12:17.68 --> 01:12:20.28
the phone in one arm and talked to headquarters.

1130
01:12:20.28 --> 01:12:24.60
Pendington listened as he discussed a mortar barrage across the river the next morning

1131
01:12:24.60 --> 01:12:28.32
and the launching of a dawn attack.

1132
01:12:28.32 --> 01:12:32.32
He's all shot up and blown up and he's planning an attack for the morning.

1133
01:12:32.32 --> 01:12:35.84
Shepard called in the artillery fire, shell soon burst in the thick it's across the

1134
01:12:35.84 --> 01:12:39.84
stream and the enemy was quiet for the rest of that evening.

1135
01:12:39.84 --> 01:12:45.16
Late in the night Polar realized that he could no longer walk and call division headquarters.

1136
01:12:45.16 --> 01:12:49.000
I find myself unable to proceed by leading my troops.

1137
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.88
He said after the delay word came back, Major John C. Weber will assume command of your

1138
01:12:54.88 --> 01:12:56.64
battalion within a few hours.

1139
01:12:56.64 --> 01:13:03.72
He is leaving the perimeter immediately.

1140
01:13:03.72 --> 01:13:12.96
So that was, you know, he gets pulled out, going back to the book, Lieutenant Colonel Polar

1141
01:13:12.96 --> 01:13:17.52
is being recommended by General Vandagriff for the Medal of Honor for leading his battalion

1142
01:13:17.52 --> 01:13:21.12
with seven holes in him continually for 24 hours.

1143
01:13:21.12 --> 01:13:24.12
It's a good recommended for the Medal of Honor.

1144
01:13:24.12 --> 01:13:28.12
This did not develop at the Division Commander in addition to commanding Polar's battalion

1145
01:13:28.12 --> 01:13:33.60
for its perimeter defense and putting in for a third Navy cross for its commander also

1146
01:13:33.60 --> 01:13:34.60
to run.

1147
01:13:34.60 --> 01:13:36.96
I have known Lewis Polar since 1919.

1148
01:13:36.96 --> 01:13:41.20
He was one of the best combat patrol officers I knew, just as he is in an outstanding officer

1149
01:13:41.20 --> 01:13:42.20
today.

1150
01:13:42.20 --> 01:13:46.16
He did a wonderful job with his battalion on Guadal Canal and every phase in the operation.

1151
01:13:46.16 --> 01:13:55.76
I am as proud to have him as a friend, as I was glad to have him as a Marine.

1152
01:13:55.76 --> 01:14:00.36
January 1st 1943 was warm and sunny and the loading went smoothly.

1153
01:14:00.36 --> 01:14:05.12
The gear was all stowed in the last of the first Marine Division troops were going aboard.

1154
01:14:05.12 --> 01:14:09.84
It was only then that their condition became apparent, men who had fought for four months

1155
01:14:09.84 --> 01:14:14.16
in the foulest climate in the Pacific and had been sheldon bombed or shot up by snipers

1156
01:14:14.16 --> 01:14:19.32
almost constantly between battles seemed to collapse at the same moment.

1157
01:14:19.32 --> 01:14:23.80
Scores were unable to climb the nets into the ships and had to be carried aboard.

1158
01:14:23.80 --> 01:14:28.72
They had shocked expressions with glazed sunken eyes.

1159
01:14:28.72 --> 01:14:34.000
For weeks, most of them would be patients with malaria, dysentery, assorted fevers and fungus

1160
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
infections.

1161
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.48
Virtually, every man in the Division had malaria by now.

1162
01:14:39.48 --> 01:14:43.44
Polar said it isn't so much that their sick are even worn out.

1163
01:14:43.44 --> 01:14:48.24
It's the reaction from the discovery that they're finally leaving this damn place and yet

1164
01:14:48.24 --> 01:14:51.76
a lot of them grew into men here.

1165
01:14:51.76 --> 01:14:59.04
The Division's dead were 1,242 and 2,655 had been wounded.

1166
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:01.28
Sickness was near total.

1167
01:15:01.28 --> 01:15:05.72
No one could yet grasp the importance of the island fighting on the day of loading out.

1168
01:15:05.72 --> 01:15:10.92
The longest of the Pacific island campaigns had been fought and the pattern of future victories

1169
01:15:10.92 --> 01:15:11.92
had been set.

1170
01:15:11.92 --> 01:15:16.56
The Japanese had paid a higher price here than they would pay again and had thrown all their

1171
01:15:16.56 --> 01:15:17.80
disposal.

1172
01:15:17.80 --> 01:15:22.24
The ships, planes, men and machines.

1173
01:15:22.24 --> 01:15:27.80
More than 50,000 men had been lost on the island or on the ships trying to reach it.

1174
01:15:27.80 --> 01:15:32.60
In Japan it was already known as the island of death.

1175
01:15:32.60 --> 01:15:39.08
For more than a year radio Tokyo was to call the First Marine Division the Guadalcanal

1176
01:15:39.08 --> 01:15:45.88
butchers.

1177
01:15:45.88 --> 01:15:49.40
So that's Guadalcanal.

1178
01:15:49.40 --> 01:15:56.76
He actually heads home and here we go back to the book.

1179
01:15:56.76 --> 01:16:00.12
An aide in the office in Washington.

1180
01:16:00.12 --> 01:16:02.44
General Thomas Holcomb jolted in with the news.

1181
01:16:02.44 --> 01:16:05.16
The general's given you to the army, Polar.

1182
01:16:05.16 --> 01:16:06.68
I mean all alone.

1183
01:16:06.68 --> 01:16:10.52
For three or four months General Marshall wants you to explain the Guadalcanal fighting

1184
01:16:10.52 --> 01:16:13.08
to his troops all over the country.

1185
01:16:13.08 --> 01:16:14.80
You needn't fret about leaving your men.

1186
01:16:14.80 --> 01:16:17.84
The division will be in Australia for the next six months before we can get back into

1187
01:16:17.84 --> 01:16:18.84
action.

1188
01:16:18.84 --> 01:16:23.16
I expect you'll rejoin it in time for another big show.

1189
01:16:23.16 --> 01:16:28.80
So there's time between these big island campaigns and he goes home to America to take

1190
01:16:28.80 --> 01:16:33.52
over or spread the word about what the fighting was like.

1191
01:16:33.52 --> 01:16:34.52
Back to the book.

1192
01:16:34.52 --> 01:16:35.72
He often spoke three times daily.

1193
01:16:35.72 --> 01:16:38.72
He was on and off planes until he all but lost track of his route.

1194
01:16:38.72 --> 01:16:42.48
He told the story of his fight for the perimeter of Baz alone pushing the wall of enemy

1195
01:16:42.48 --> 01:16:47.16
bodies down the hill of burials by bulldozer and of weapons they used.

1196
01:16:47.16 --> 01:16:53.24
He told of patrols and thick growth but never of his wounds.

1197
01:16:53.24 --> 01:16:57.88
I can't tell you the japs are no damn good he said because they are good.

1198
01:16:57.88 --> 01:16:59.52
But we're better.

1199
01:16:59.52 --> 01:17:04.000
One American properly trained can handle two of the yellow bastards.

1200
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.60
They have discipline and they use the jungle cover better than we do but they can't think

1201
01:17:08.60 --> 01:17:09.96
on their own.

1202
01:17:09.96 --> 01:17:22.28
That's a critical dichotomy.

1203
01:17:22.28 --> 01:17:29.12
The discipline which obviously is something that I am passionate about.

1204
01:17:29.12 --> 01:17:32.72
But if you put so much discipline in two much discipline in place people don't think

1205
01:17:32.72 --> 01:17:34.40
for themselves anymore.

1206
01:17:34.40 --> 01:17:38.20
They just wait.

1207
01:17:38.20 --> 01:17:42.000
They never change battle plans once they're made regardless of costs.

1208
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.44
They think they lose face.

1209
01:17:43.44 --> 01:17:47.64
They have no artillery compared with ours and our guns chew them to pieces.

1210
01:17:47.64 --> 01:17:50.44
They get the jungle rot just as much as we do.

1211
01:17:50.44 --> 01:17:54.28
They're not superman and will whip the hell out of them and you'll be helping to do it

1212
01:17:54.28 --> 01:17:56.28
soon I suppose.

1213
01:17:56.28 --> 01:17:59.64
If you take your training seriously then there's nothing to worry about.

1214
01:17:59.64 --> 01:18:05.12
But you'll have to be hard and you can be hard when you write with your families.

1215
01:18:05.12 --> 01:18:10.52
You try to convince them that we're in a war to the finish and that all these strikes

1216
01:18:10.52 --> 01:18:14.64
and softness and confusion will have to go.

1217
01:18:14.64 --> 01:18:16.16
I can tell you one more thing.

1218
01:18:16.16 --> 01:18:22.24
There are worse things than dying for your country.

1219
01:18:22.24 --> 01:18:25.56
When you spoke to the war production board officials in Washington here's what he said.

1220
01:18:25.56 --> 01:18:28.36
I want to ask you why American troops shouldn't have the best.

1221
01:18:28.36 --> 01:18:29.92
The world's best fighting equipment.

1222
01:18:29.92 --> 01:18:33.44
On Guadalcan now we saw our trenching shovels break at first use.

1223
01:18:33.44 --> 01:18:37.96
All from men now have jab shovels because they're better and more dependable.

1224
01:18:37.96 --> 01:18:40.24
Jab field glasses are better too.

1225
01:18:40.24 --> 01:18:43.68
I have good ones myself, German glasses that I've carried for 20 years.

1226
01:18:43.68 --> 01:18:45.72
Why should American glasses be so poor?

1227
01:18:45.72 --> 01:18:47.40
Not worth the damn in the tropics.

1228
01:18:47.40 --> 01:18:50.32
They fog up and they are improperly sealed.

1229
01:18:50.32 --> 01:18:51.84
Once they get damped they're done for.

1230
01:18:51.84 --> 01:18:56.80
I've seen hundreds of pairs tossed away in the jungle or sea because men know they can

1231
01:18:56.80 --> 01:18:58.44
see as well with the naked eye.

1232
01:18:58.44 --> 01:19:04.56
What kind of American ingenuity or patriotism produce those?

1233
01:19:04.56 --> 01:19:06.92
He doesn't play.

1234
01:19:06.92 --> 01:19:10.28
This is a little part about humility.

1235
01:19:10.28 --> 01:19:13.68
We'll have to get over the idea that where the greatest people on earth and every respect,

1236
01:19:13.68 --> 01:19:18.20
that we're infalible and that no one else has ideas worth considering.

1237
01:19:18.20 --> 01:19:23.72
One of the reasons we had to fight against the odds on Guadalcan now was this insufferable

1238
01:19:23.72 --> 01:19:28.48
American notion of superiority and our carelessness in the face of danger.

1239
01:19:28.48 --> 01:19:30.84
It goes back to Pearl Harbor and far beyond.

1240
01:19:30.84 --> 01:19:33.04
He said, you got to stay humble.

1241
01:19:33.04 --> 01:19:37.000
He can't be arrogant.

1242
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.48
He was summoned before the high command of the Marine Corps and gave the same fourth

1243
01:19:42.48 --> 01:19:46.28
right picture of the fighting he had seen.

1244
01:19:46.28 --> 01:19:49.16
Gentlemen, we have some of the same old troubles.

1245
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:53.68
Staff officers who've never seen combat issue unrealistic orders that cost lives

1246
01:19:53.68 --> 01:19:57.04
time, money and ruin morale.

1247
01:19:57.04 --> 01:20:02.000
For example, we were out there on that island trying to defend a perimeter when they

1248
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.64
wanted to send a patrol outside the command never used a single regiment but sent out three

1249
01:20:07.64 --> 01:20:09.36
mixed battalions.

1250
01:20:09.36 --> 01:20:12.72
The logical thing would have been a regular regiment with one battalion leading the

1251
01:20:12.72 --> 01:20:15.24
other and the other two covering.

1252
01:20:15.24 --> 01:20:18.52
Officers and men would be familiar with each other and there would never be questions

1253
01:20:18.52 --> 01:20:21.52
about who is in command.

1254
01:20:21.52 --> 01:20:25.20
When we did go out, it was almost always with mixed battalions.

1255
01:20:25.20 --> 01:20:30.88
It may look good in the staff officers chart here at headquarters but it didn't work.

1256
01:20:30.88 --> 01:20:34.000
Brought us only stumbling and confusing and casualties.

1257
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.20
More than once, we were out in the jungle, nobody really knew who is in command.

1258
01:20:39.20 --> 01:20:42.28
I could cite you the names of many a man I lost because of that.

1259
01:20:42.28 --> 01:20:43.68
It was inexcusable.

1260
01:20:43.68 --> 01:20:49.60
This is something that it absolutely is very important to understand, especially for

1261
01:20:49.60 --> 01:20:52.24
guys that are, I guess anybody.

1262
01:20:52.24 --> 01:20:55.48
You work in your train in a certain way.

1263
01:20:55.48 --> 01:21:01.04
As much as you can, stay in the groups that you work in train with.

1264
01:21:01.04 --> 01:21:06.52
For them to just randomly, who knows why they did this, but I'll tell you what I've seen.

1265
01:21:06.52 --> 01:21:12.04
I've seen this where let's say there's some operation.

1266
01:21:12.04 --> 01:21:16.76
That's a high visibility operation that everyone thinks, wow, that'd be a cool operation

1267
01:21:16.76 --> 01:21:18.76
to do.

1268
01:21:18.76 --> 01:21:25.32
Instead of just taking, let's say, one company, they go, okay, well, we want to get multiple

1269
01:21:25.32 --> 01:21:28.48
different people to get to be able to be involved in this operation.

1270
01:21:28.48 --> 01:21:32.40
So, take one, one, put two in from this company, one put two in from this other company,

1271
01:21:32.40 --> 01:21:35.28
and we'll just send them all out there.

1272
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:36.68
That's exactly what he's talking about.

1273
01:21:36.68 --> 01:21:41.08
No, no, hey, sorry, you guys aren't going to go on this operation.

1274
01:21:41.08 --> 01:21:44.20
We're sending an alpha company or a bravo company or whatever.

1275
01:21:44.20 --> 01:21:46.96
That's the way you do it.

1276
01:21:46.96 --> 01:21:47.96
Play around.

1277
01:21:47.96 --> 01:21:57.12
Here's a little comment because I love machine guns.

1278
01:21:57.12 --> 01:21:59.92
A little comment on the art of machine gunnery.

1279
01:21:59.92 --> 01:22:05.72
These guns are the most important firepower to infantry.

1280
01:22:05.72 --> 01:22:07.52
I'm just making that statement.

1281
01:22:07.52 --> 01:22:08.52
Cool.

1282
01:22:08.52 --> 01:22:09.96
Tested, chesty-polar.

1283
01:22:09.96 --> 01:22:10.96
Statement.

1284
01:22:10.96 --> 01:22:18.24
Machine guns go be a machine gunner.

1285
01:22:18.24 --> 01:22:19.24
You know what I'm saying?

1286
01:22:19.24 --> 01:22:22.88
I know, I was so fired up one day, we were at the gym and I walked in.

1287
01:22:22.88 --> 01:22:27.36
There was some kid was signing up and he was, no, I call him a kid.

1288
01:22:27.36 --> 01:22:29.88
He was probably, oh man, 24 years old, yeah.

1289
01:22:29.88 --> 01:22:36.56
And so I said, hey, oh man, no, I think, I said, you know, I could tell, yeah, like

1290
01:22:36.56 --> 01:22:37.56
a high-intite.

1291
01:22:37.56 --> 01:22:38.84
I was like, oh, are you in military?

1292
01:22:38.84 --> 01:22:40.64
He goes, yeah, I'm in the Marine Corps.

1293
01:22:40.64 --> 01:22:42.16
I said, what are you doing the Marine Corps?

1294
01:22:42.16 --> 01:22:44.36
He said, machine gunner.

1295
01:22:44.36 --> 01:22:45.36
Dig it.

1296
01:22:45.36 --> 01:22:46.36
S.

1297
01:22:46.36 --> 01:22:48.36
Awesome.

1298
01:22:48.36 --> 01:22:50.20
All right.

1299
01:22:50.20 --> 01:22:57.68
Here's another comment.

1300
01:22:57.68 --> 01:23:02.32
We just don't know all we ought to know about warfare on land or sea.

1301
01:23:02.32 --> 01:23:05.36
Just off-Grawl Channel, not long ago, we lost three cruises.

1302
01:23:05.36 --> 01:23:09.52
Cruisers blasted down by jab guns as they sat there, sitting ducks, that's all.

1303
01:23:09.52 --> 01:23:11.56
I'll tell you exactly why we lost him.

1304
01:23:11.56 --> 01:23:15.40
The Admiral and Charred got a plane report that the jab force was approaching at 14 knots

1305
01:23:15.40 --> 01:23:16.40
by daylight.

1306
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:20.04
So we figured at this speed the enemy couldn't arrive in his waters before the next

1307
01:23:20.04 --> 01:23:21.04
dawn.

1308
01:23:21.04 --> 01:23:26.16
After dark, of course, the jab stepped up through speed to 28 knots and got to the

1309
01:23:26.16 --> 01:23:30.92
scene at 3 a.m. when our men were not even at battle stations.

1310
01:23:30.92 --> 01:23:33.08
Instead of keeping, it happened like that.

1311
01:23:33.08 --> 01:23:34.08
I'm positive.

1312
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:38.56
And instead of keeping such thing secret, we ought to have them emblazoned on the

1313
01:23:38.56 --> 01:23:41.04
gate at every naval station.

1314
01:23:41.04 --> 01:23:48.08
We must not be too proud or too stupid to profit by armistakes.

1315
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:50.44
And God knows that we make them.

1316
01:23:50.44 --> 01:23:52.68
Have you ever heard the term profit from armistakes before?

1317
01:23:52.68 --> 01:23:54.20
No, but I really like it.

1318
01:23:54.20 --> 01:23:56.84
Yeah, I think I really like it too.

1319
01:23:56.84 --> 01:23:58.08
Why not?

1320
01:23:58.08 --> 01:24:00.44
Profit from your mistakes.

1321
01:24:00.44 --> 01:24:01.44
It's brilliant.

1322
01:24:01.44 --> 01:24:05.48
Yeah, kind of puts it more into, you know, they say, learn from your mistakes, right?

1323
01:24:05.48 --> 01:24:06.48
Yeah, they learn cool.

1324
01:24:06.48 --> 01:24:08.96
So when you say proud to say something, so much more valuable.

1325
01:24:08.96 --> 01:24:17.76
Yeah, talks a little bit about, uh, well, the psychological impact of combat.

1326
01:24:17.76 --> 01:24:21.88
I know something about the strain of combat for five years in Nicaragua, March, at least

1327
01:24:21.88 --> 01:24:26.32
20 days a month under constant foot out of enemy ambushed.

1328
01:24:26.32 --> 01:24:31.28
But I never saw those, but I never saw those Indian troops any sign of battle fatigue or

1329
01:24:31.28 --> 01:24:32.92
anything resembling it.

1330
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:38.000
In a pacific, I saw a lot of our people break down. my reaction is this, what does it matter?

1331
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.92
How you're killed if you're killed in battle?

1332
01:24:40.92 --> 01:24:44.80
Why does the louder noise in a fight with every artillery embombs makes such a difference?

1333
01:24:44.80 --> 01:24:50.80
I think the difference is entirely in the mind and the preparation of men for combat.

1334
01:24:50.80 --> 01:24:55.84
In Haiti, actions when I fought, the men were all picked volunteers, professionals who were

1335
01:24:55.84 --> 01:24:59.68
paid to fight and realized they might die in the trade.

1336
01:24:59.68 --> 01:25:03.000
I'm sure from my own experience that it's the mental attitude.

1337
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.24
I went through the worst days they had on Guadalcanal and I didn't suffer a bit.

1338
01:25:07.24 --> 01:25:11.68
I lost some weight, but that was because we didn't get the proper food.

1339
01:25:11.68 --> 01:25:17.12
If we make our men tough in the mind before they go to war and give them an honest idea

1340
01:25:17.12 --> 01:25:22.08
of what war is like, we won't have so much of this trouble.

1341
01:25:22.08 --> 01:25:27.32
Why do we have to baby them with all this crap about careers and opportunity and foreign

1342
01:25:27.32 --> 01:25:28.32
travel?

1343
01:25:28.32 --> 01:25:31.60
Oh, yeah.

1344
01:25:31.60 --> 01:25:33.24
You know what I mean?

1345
01:25:33.24 --> 01:25:34.24
You know what I mean?

1346
01:25:34.24 --> 01:25:37.24
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1347
01:25:37.24 --> 01:25:46.16
They say, forget where I read this, but people who come back from war, they kind of differentiated

1348
01:25:46.16 --> 01:25:53.56
where people who were in it, like JPE and you and I just always wanted to do this, to

1349
01:25:53.56 --> 01:25:57.88
be a combat leader, to be a Navy SEAL, to be a commando, typically people with that kind

1350
01:25:57.88 --> 01:26:01.40
of attitude, they don't get affected by it because it's kind of like the thing.

1351
01:26:01.40 --> 01:26:02.88
They get affected less.

1352
01:26:02.88 --> 01:26:03.88
Yeah, generally.

1353
01:26:03.88 --> 01:26:04.88
You are correct.

1354
01:26:04.88 --> 01:26:10.84
Generally, guys that like special operations, guys, that's what they wanted to do.

1355
01:26:10.84 --> 01:26:14.28
There's a little bunch of other things that play into that as well.

1356
01:26:14.28 --> 01:26:17.16
The training, because he's talking about hard training, well, that's what, in special

1357
01:26:17.16 --> 01:26:20.000
operations, you do get harder training.

1358
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
You have a tighter, or you have a real close relationship with all your guys and you

1359
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.16
stay together with your guys.

1360
01:26:27.16 --> 01:26:30.000
That is helpful too.

1361
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.68
It's not any tighter relationship that you have in an infantry, because in trust me, I've

1362
01:26:33.68 --> 01:26:38.60
seen those in Marine Corps and Army infantry and military units get tight, doesn't matter

1363
01:26:38.60 --> 01:26:40.68
whether your special operations are not.

1364
01:26:40.68 --> 01:26:44.56
But the training, they step up the training, they make it really hard.

1365
01:26:44.56 --> 01:26:48.52
That plays a role, but I think your right is that guys that think that that's what they

1366
01:26:48.52 --> 01:26:51.24
want to do, then that helps as well.

1367
01:26:51.24 --> 01:26:57.76
There's a bunch of little factors, but I think what his point is, like there's two,

1368
01:26:57.76 --> 01:26:58.76
there's two points.

1369
01:26:58.76 --> 01:27:01.08
Number one, make the training hard as, I guess there's three points.

1370
01:27:01.08 --> 01:27:03.000
Number one, make the training hard as hell.

1371
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.40
Number two, make sure people know it too expect and don't talk to them about the career

1372
01:27:09.40 --> 01:27:10.40
opportunities.

1373
01:27:10.40 --> 01:27:11.40
Right.

1374
01:27:11.40 --> 01:27:13.24
I just answered this question on the way of the warrior kid bought cast, right?

1375
01:27:13.24 --> 01:27:17.48
Well, I answered the question, the question was, is it fun to be an AV seal?

1376
01:27:17.48 --> 01:27:21.08
And I answered the question, hey, is it fun?

1377
01:27:21.08 --> 01:27:23.28
Yes, absolutely, it's fun.

1378
01:27:23.28 --> 01:27:24.24
That's part of it.

1379
01:27:24.24 --> 01:27:29.52
But the other part of it is you are going to go to war and you could die.

1380
01:27:29.52 --> 01:27:32.84
And that's a harsh thing to tell a nine-year-old or a ten-year-old.

1381
01:27:32.84 --> 01:27:35.72
But that's exactly what you should tell a nine-year-old or a ten-year-old.

1382
01:27:35.72 --> 01:27:38.16
Because that's what you're signing up for.

1383
01:27:38.16 --> 01:27:44.48
I was doing another interview recently and I told this story and I've told it before,

1384
01:27:44.48 --> 01:27:50.52
but it was like the first time some woman that I had been working with a company and some

1385
01:27:50.52 --> 01:27:54.68
woman that had her husband or something.

1386
01:27:54.68 --> 01:27:58.08
Anyways, the woman said, can you meet my son?

1387
01:27:58.08 --> 01:28:00.80
He really wants to be an AV seal.

1388
01:28:00.80 --> 01:28:03.12
And I was, you know, I said, oh, yeah, sure.

1389
01:28:03.12 --> 01:28:05.36
The kid was whatever 17 or 18 years old.

1390
01:28:05.36 --> 01:28:11.000
He was a junior senior in high school and he was this strapping kid who was, you know,

1391
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.36
looked like a great athlete and she wanted to bring me to lunch with him.

1392
01:28:15.36 --> 01:28:20.04
So we went to lunch and it was, you know, the details of the story.

1393
01:28:20.04 --> 01:28:26.12
I don't recall exactly, but it was basically, you know, my son, he wants to be an AV seal.

1394
01:28:26.12 --> 01:28:29.72
He's on the swim team and he's on the track team and he played football and he just loves

1395
01:28:29.72 --> 01:28:32.32
working out and he just, I think he'd be great.

1396
01:28:32.32 --> 01:28:37.16
He just, he can do 28 pull-ups and the kids like, yeah, I love working out and I plus

1397
01:28:37.16 --> 01:28:38.76
I surf too and I love the ocean.

1398
01:28:38.76 --> 01:28:40.56
I love the water.

1399
01:28:40.56 --> 01:28:45.04
It was like cool and, you know, for a while, you know, I was listening and then, you know,

1400
01:28:45.04 --> 01:28:50.80
of course I was like, yeah, you know, that sounds like, sounds like you'd be well-prepared

1401
01:28:50.80 --> 01:28:53.000
for the physical aspects of it.

1402
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.76
But when you have to remember that the reason you become a seal is so you can go and fight

1403
01:28:56.76 --> 01:28:59.44
in wars and you're going to kill people and you're going to be at the risk of dying

1404
01:28:59.44 --> 01:29:03.32
and you're going to be at the risk of being wounded and that's what's going to happen to

1405
01:29:03.32 --> 01:29:07.000
your friends if not you.

1406
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.92
And when I got done saying like on that sentence, the mom's face completely changed.

1407
01:29:12.92 --> 01:29:17.48
Because it's what he's talking about right here, which is, hey, you know, it's travel

1408
01:29:17.48 --> 01:29:24.68
and adventure and career opportunities like no, what it is is war and savagery and the

1409
01:29:24.68 --> 01:29:29.76
worst things that you could possibly experience is what you're going to experience.

1410
01:29:29.76 --> 01:29:31.32
That's what you need to tell people.

1411
01:29:31.32 --> 01:29:36.92
Yeah, the special operations and the conclusion for what I was reading there was,

1412
01:29:36.92 --> 01:29:44.20
people when they go in knowing and kind of how they put it, like forward leaning into the

1413
01:29:44.20 --> 01:29:49.48
realities of a military situation, it tends to be special operations or guys who want to

1414
01:29:49.48 --> 01:29:51.04
do it for that reason.

1415
01:29:51.04 --> 01:29:54.84
Not the guy who got sold on World Travel, the way I got to college.

1416
01:29:54.84 --> 01:29:58.16
That guy is definitely going to have a rough time with it.

1417
01:29:58.16 --> 01:30:04.24
And you've got to remember, too, there's hundreds of there's a massive percentage of Army

1418
01:30:04.24 --> 01:30:07.12
infantry, Marine Corps infantry, guess what they want to be?

1419
01:30:07.12 --> 01:30:09.76
Marine Corps infantry, they want to be, that's what they want to do.

1420
01:30:09.76 --> 01:30:14.56
They're just as passionate about that as some guy, like, because that job, it's a little

1421
01:30:14.56 --> 01:30:18.96
bit different, but a lot of that parts of that job are, you know, when we had Brian

1422
01:30:18.96 --> 01:30:24.28
Stan on, we talked about this, you know, like Brian Stan was, you get to be in charge

1423
01:30:24.28 --> 01:30:30.84
of more people, you get, it's a different dynamic, but the combat leadership opportunities

1424
01:30:30.84 --> 01:30:33.20
and just the combat opportunities.

1425
01:30:33.20 --> 01:30:37.12
I mean, when we were in the body, the guy's the infantry in the body, let's guys

1426
01:30:37.12 --> 01:30:38.76
were freaking getting after it.

1427
01:30:38.76 --> 01:30:42.60
They were just, it was insane to watch those guys.

1428
01:30:42.60 --> 01:30:48.72
So, you know, there's plenty, I mean, there's the vast majority or there's plenty of guys

1429
01:30:48.72 --> 01:30:51.64
in the regular conventional forces.

1430
01:30:51.64 --> 01:30:57.08
They do just as good after combat as the special operations guys do.

1431
01:30:57.08 --> 01:30:59.80
So it's more, and we talked about this Peter Tia.

1432
01:30:59.80 --> 01:31:03.40
It was like, if a guy's fractured going in, it doesn't matter if he's special operations

1433
01:31:03.40 --> 01:31:08.72
or conventional forces or general purpose units, he's, if he's fractured going in, the

1434
01:31:08.72 --> 01:31:09.96
war's going to mess him up.

1435
01:31:09.96 --> 01:31:10.96
Yeah.

1436
01:31:10.96 --> 01:31:13.52
If he's solid going in, he's going to do well.

1437
01:31:13.52 --> 01:31:15.28
So that's the determining factor.

1438
01:31:15.28 --> 01:31:17.48
The training definitely helps.

1439
01:31:17.48 --> 01:31:23.04
The telling people the truth upfront definitely helps, but you don't know what you're going

1440
01:31:23.04 --> 01:31:24.04
to get.

1441
01:31:24.04 --> 01:31:25.04
Yeah.

1442
01:31:25.04 --> 01:31:28.000
And there's also plenty guys' special operations that do have serious issues.

1443
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Yeah.

1444
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.72
And the article wasn't about like special operations.

1445
01:31:31.72 --> 01:31:32.72
That's not what it was about.

1446
01:31:32.72 --> 01:31:33.72
It was more about the state of mind.

1447
01:31:33.72 --> 01:31:38.44
I think special where I know that special operations was just like an example of some

1448
01:31:38.44 --> 01:31:39.72
point that they were making.

1449
01:31:39.72 --> 01:31:43.92
Well, we talked again, I'm referencing all these different podcasts, but when Jordan Peterson

1450
01:31:43.92 --> 01:31:46.76
was on, we talked about like the offensive mindset.

1451
01:31:46.76 --> 01:31:47.76
Right.

1452
01:31:47.76 --> 01:31:52.60
And the offensive you can be, generally, the more psychologically comforting that is.

1453
01:31:52.60 --> 01:31:55.60
It's psychologically uncomfortable to be on the defensive.

1454
01:31:55.60 --> 01:31:56.60
Yeah.

1455
01:31:56.60 --> 01:31:59.60
And it's more psychologically comfortable to be on the offensive.

1456
01:31:59.60 --> 01:32:00.60
Right.

1457
01:32:00.60 --> 01:32:01.60
Did I just get that right?

1458
01:32:01.60 --> 01:32:02.60
Yes.

1459
01:32:02.60 --> 01:32:06.60
Psychologically uncomfortable to be on the defensive psychologically more comfortable.

1460
01:32:06.60 --> 01:32:10.40
It's not necessarily comfortable because you still have bad things that can happen when

1461
01:32:10.40 --> 01:32:13.40
you're on offense, but it's definitely psychologically more comfortable.

1462
01:32:13.40 --> 01:32:14.40
Yeah.

1463
01:32:14.40 --> 01:32:15.40
So those things play a role.

1464
01:32:15.40 --> 01:32:16.40
Yeah.

1465
01:32:16.40 --> 01:32:19.24
I'm going to like, you happen like to your experience, right?

1466
01:32:19.24 --> 01:32:20.24
You consider an experience.

1467
01:32:20.24 --> 01:32:23.52
It's like, I'm going to happen to this experience rather than this experience.

1468
01:32:23.52 --> 01:32:24.52
It'll be offensive.

1469
01:32:24.52 --> 01:32:25.52
It's a defensive.

1470
01:32:25.52 --> 01:32:26.52
Absolutely.

1471
01:32:26.52 --> 01:32:33.04
We will say, hey, how life is life treating you versus how are you treating life?

1472
01:32:33.04 --> 01:32:34.04
You know that old saying.

1473
01:32:34.04 --> 01:32:35.04
Yeah.

1474
01:32:35.04 --> 01:32:36.04
You see what I'm saying?

1475
01:32:36.04 --> 01:32:37.04
I'll go with it.

1476
01:32:37.04 --> 01:32:38.04
Yeah.

1477
01:32:38.04 --> 01:32:39.04
Just go with it.

1478
01:32:39.04 --> 01:32:41.72
Here's another thing that he calls out.

1479
01:32:41.72 --> 01:32:43.04
And this is very interesting.

1480
01:32:43.04 --> 01:32:48.52
And everyone that's in the military will hear this and kind of shake their head.

1481
01:32:48.52 --> 01:32:53.28
The practice of having command post exercises, Polar said, though he realized that he was

1482
01:32:53.28 --> 01:32:58.88
trading on prominent toes in his audience, we take skeleton forces of headquarters troops

1483
01:32:58.88 --> 01:33:03.58
and the like, just a handful and go through exercises so often that we forget we aren't

1484
01:33:03.58 --> 01:33:06.52
simulating that we aren't simulating actual warfare.

1485
01:33:06.52 --> 01:33:11.96
It has become so bad that even platoons are carrying out command post exercises.

1486
01:33:11.96 --> 01:33:17.48
In battle, of course, once you set up a CP, which is a command post, you stop for all,

1487
01:33:17.48 --> 01:33:19.52
you stop all forward motion.

1488
01:33:19.52 --> 01:33:23.52
Because the commander sit on their duffs in relative security.

1489
01:33:23.52 --> 01:33:27.28
And when you halt forward motion, you get in trouble immediately.

1490
01:33:27.28 --> 01:33:30.32
I have to admit, we have to learn.

1491
01:33:30.32 --> 01:33:34.20
I admit we have to learn how to handle commands, but we've carried it to a ridiculous

1492
01:33:34.20 --> 01:33:37.20
extreme.

1493
01:33:37.20 --> 01:33:40.52
They do a lot of that command exercises.

1494
01:33:40.52 --> 01:33:44.36
The most unrealistic thing about it is like he's saying that you'll have not a real

1495
01:33:44.36 --> 01:33:49.000
platoon, but like a small representation of a platoon.

1496
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.88
So the commander can move that platoon around really easily because it's this little thing.

1497
01:33:52.88 --> 01:33:58.84
But then when you have a real platoon that takes real vehicles and real, it's like moving

1498
01:33:58.84 --> 01:34:04.04
pieces on a board that's opposed to like, well, you move this battalion from here to there.

1499
01:34:04.04 --> 01:34:08.20
All you do is just move this move their piece on a board.

1500
01:34:08.20 --> 01:34:09.60
That was real easy.

1501
01:34:09.60 --> 01:34:13.60
You look at what actually happens in the field when you move that piece of a battalion.

1502
01:34:13.60 --> 01:34:14.60
It's massive.

1503
01:34:14.60 --> 01:34:19.92
It's this incredible project to make it happen.

1504
01:34:19.92 --> 01:34:20.92
Yeah.

1505
01:34:20.92 --> 01:34:25.92
To move a battalion, you know, four miles or two miles or whatever.

1506
01:34:25.92 --> 01:34:28.04
It's like, this is what it's going to take.

1507
01:34:28.04 --> 01:34:32.36
Fuel and food and ammunition and wounded and planning and all this stuff.

1508
01:34:32.36 --> 01:34:34.60
But the person up top just goes, oh yeah, we'll just have that entire day.

1509
01:34:34.60 --> 01:34:35.60
Yeah.

1510
01:34:35.60 --> 01:34:40.44
One morning as he approached a company of his men lounging among their tents, a newly

1511
01:34:40.44 --> 01:34:44.36
arrived lieutenant, barked in order and the reen scramble to their feet standing and

1512
01:34:44.36 --> 01:34:45.36
attention.

1513
01:34:45.36 --> 01:34:46.96
What the hell's wrong with you, Polarord?

1514
01:34:46.96 --> 01:34:50.92
Don't you think I've got more sense than to manned that you put on a show every time

1515
01:34:50.92 --> 01:34:54.56
I come with him pistol range, get back down on your duffs.

1516
01:34:54.56 --> 01:34:59.76
You ought to know me well enough that I'm no damned, banned box soldier.

1517
01:34:59.76 --> 01:35:00.76
Take it easy.

1518
01:35:00.76 --> 01:35:03.16
There's enough for you to do when we get to our next assignment.

1519
01:35:03.16 --> 01:35:04.16
Again, dichotomy.

1520
01:35:04.16 --> 01:35:05.16
It's okay.

1521
01:35:05.16 --> 01:35:09.16
You don't need to snap to attention every time I come around.

1522
01:35:09.16 --> 01:35:16.44
There's an army quartermaster and the general showed up and they had asked for a bunch

1523
01:35:16.44 --> 01:35:18.000
of shotgun shells.

1524
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.28
Here we go back to the book.

1525
01:35:19.28 --> 01:35:22.44
He's asked for 10,000 brass buckshot shells.

1526
01:35:22.44 --> 01:35:24.64
What the devilities he want with those?

1527
01:35:24.64 --> 01:35:29.08
To kill Japs with Sir doesn't Colonel Polar know that Buckshot is prohibited by the Geneva

1528
01:35:29.08 --> 01:35:30.08
Convention.

1529
01:35:30.08 --> 01:35:34.24
Sir, Colonel Polar doesn't give a damn about the Geneva Convention anymore than the

1530
01:35:34.24 --> 01:35:43.40
Japs did at Pearl Harbor.

1531
01:35:43.40 --> 01:35:52.60
Now as they're getting ready to go and assault, Gloster, the enemy had word of the coming

1532
01:35:52.60 --> 01:35:53.60
assault.

1533
01:35:53.60 --> 01:35:58.56
Radio Tokyo Blair'd one afternoon in late December the first American Marine Division

1534
01:35:58.56 --> 01:36:05.16
Assorted cutthroats, degenerates and jail birds has been chased out of Melbourne is now

1535
01:36:05.16 --> 01:36:09.60
in Camp and New Guinea and will try to invade Cape Gloster.

1536
01:36:09.60 --> 01:36:13.20
I'm pleased to add that our soldiers are fully prepared to repulse the Sinslow attempt.

1537
01:36:13.20 --> 01:36:17.80
The jungles will run red with the blood of the Guadalcanal butchers.

1538
01:36:17.80 --> 01:36:24.56
So that's the propaganda cutthroats degenerates and jail birds.

1539
01:36:24.56 --> 01:36:25.68
So now they're going to Gloster.

1540
01:36:25.68 --> 01:36:27.32
Cape Gloster.

1541
01:36:27.32 --> 01:36:30.40
On the early morning of December 26, they stood off Cape Gloster.

1542
01:36:30.40 --> 01:36:35.32
Big guns on the fleet rolled for a half for an hour and a half beginning before dawn

1543
01:36:35.32 --> 01:36:37.24
in the Marines in their traditional D-Day Breck.

1544
01:36:37.24 --> 01:36:41.12
Eighth their traditional D-Day Breckfist of Staken Eggs.

1545
01:36:41.12 --> 01:36:44.84
While Salva's shook the holes beneath them.

1546
01:36:44.84 --> 01:36:48.64
Third Battalion 7th Marines landed first quickly followed by Polar's old Battalion which

1547
01:36:48.64 --> 01:36:54.20
floundered through a marass behind the beach and pushed up the tall noll already known

1548
01:36:54.20 --> 01:36:57.76
to aviators and shipgunners as target hill.

1549
01:36:57.76 --> 01:37:01.64
An hour after the 7th was ashore, the first Marines came, turned toward the airfield

1550
01:37:01.64 --> 01:37:04.44
and walked into a well-laid Japanese ambush.

1551
01:37:04.44 --> 01:37:10.56
Tank's came into clear the enemy from their hidden bunkers and by nightfall the first

1552
01:37:10.56 --> 01:37:12.72
was well on its way to the airfield.

1553
01:37:12.72 --> 01:37:18.20
A falling tree in the soggy forest injured one Marine and otherwise they were only 20 killed

1554
01:37:18.20 --> 01:37:20.76
and 22 wounded on D-Day.

1555
01:37:20.76 --> 01:37:26.08
The most dangerous casualties were estimated at 50 on December 30th the first and fifth secured

1556
01:37:26.08 --> 01:37:32.64
the field after hand-to-hand fighting in which they had to call on tanks for help.

1557
01:37:32.64 --> 01:37:36.04
One sergeant remembered a moment from a mortar attack by the enemy.

1558
01:37:36.04 --> 01:37:39.12
A kid sitting there in his foxhole he didn't have any head.

1559
01:37:39.12 --> 01:37:41.88
He just had a neck with dog tags on it.

1560
01:37:41.88 --> 01:37:46.36
A gray faced youngster nearby was muttering as he fled, as he fired his rifle, it don't

1561
01:37:46.36 --> 01:37:47.36
do any good.

1562
01:37:47.36 --> 01:37:49.80
I got three of them but it don't do any good.

1563
01:37:49.80 --> 01:37:54.76
The Japanese sniper said infiltrated the line and killed Marines at short range and one unit

1564
01:37:54.76 --> 01:37:58.92
tried to waive the stream was broken.

1565
01:37:58.92 --> 01:38:02.68
It survivors driven to hide in the weeds on the edge.

1566
01:38:02.68 --> 01:38:08.04
From midstream a boy who failed to make it over hung over a log is body riddled by a

1567
01:38:08.04 --> 01:38:09.40
score of bullets.

1568
01:38:09.40 --> 01:38:12.92
For an half an hour or more he called to his mates before he died.

1569
01:38:12.92 --> 01:38:14.20
I'm here.

1570
01:38:14.20 --> 01:38:16.48
Here I am.

1571
01:38:16.48 --> 01:38:21.48
The attack had stalled, but line had now become you-shaped with a pocket of the enemy holding

1572
01:38:21.48 --> 01:38:24.08
back the center.

1573
01:38:24.08 --> 01:38:28.56
General Rupertus from division relieved the commander of the third battalion seventh

1574
01:38:28.56 --> 01:38:34.36
Marines and sent Polar into action once more with orders to reorganize and drive forward

1575
01:38:34.36 --> 01:38:38.000
the unit.

1576
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.04
So they weren't making any progress.

1577
01:38:45.04 --> 01:38:49.04
The commander said you know what, I'm pulling Polar back in action.

1578
01:38:49.04 --> 01:38:52.28
Send the wolf.

1579
01:38:52.28 --> 01:38:57.88
The trouble was the same and here's Polar talking to his guys as he showed up.

1580
01:38:57.88 --> 01:38:59.44
The Polar was the same old thing.

1581
01:38:59.44 --> 01:39:00.92
The trouble was the same old thing.

1582
01:39:00.92 --> 01:39:05.28
Staff officers don't know the meaning of terrain and how it conslowed down troops and

1583
01:39:05.28 --> 01:39:06.28
cost lives.

1584
01:39:06.28 --> 01:39:08.44
I went up to the front about two in the afternoon.

1585
01:39:08.44 --> 01:39:12.60
I called the company commanders and told them as briefly as I could what I had in mind.

1586
01:39:12.60 --> 01:39:15.72
I've been sent to take over, your commander has been relieved.

1587
01:39:15.72 --> 01:39:19.000
I don't intend to believe you can bet on that.

1588
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.52
We're going to attack here in the morning.

1589
01:39:21.52 --> 01:39:25.000
There were protests that the jab bunkers could not be seen and that they were cutting

1590
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
up our line.

1591
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.96
I told them I had the medicine for that.

1592
01:39:27.96 --> 01:39:31.96
I ordered up some of Joe Buckley's half-tracks because I knew their guns could deal

1593
01:39:31.96 --> 01:39:33.76
with the bunkers.

1594
01:39:33.76 --> 01:39:38.12
The resistance was fairly light, but the staff orders were so foolish that we were just

1595
01:39:38.12 --> 01:39:41.36
sitting targets that we were making sitting targets of our people.

1596
01:39:41.36 --> 01:39:43.88
The blockley did a great job there as he always did.

1597
01:39:43.88 --> 01:39:48.32
They had orders and these battions to guide both right and left in order that can't be

1598
01:39:48.32 --> 01:39:51.56
followed well even on a pernate parade ground.

1599
01:39:51.56 --> 01:39:56.44
Any beginner knows that you can guide left or you can guide right or even center, but

1600
01:39:56.44 --> 01:39:59.80
you can't follow two leaders on either side at the same time.

1601
01:39:59.80 --> 01:40:01.84
The line will buckle and cause gaps.

1602
01:40:01.84 --> 01:40:06.24
We were frustrating the troops with delays to reform the line.

1603
01:40:06.24 --> 01:40:10.88
I just said now we will go forward and forget about all this guiding business.

1604
01:40:10.88 --> 01:40:12.76
We forget there is anybody on the flanks.

1605
01:40:12.76 --> 01:40:16.68
We have enough power here to drive and we are going to drive, blow your way through

1606
01:40:16.68 --> 01:40:20.80
think of nothing else.

1607
01:40:20.80 --> 01:40:23.60
So important part there once again.

1608
01:40:23.60 --> 01:40:26.60
You can't follow multiple leaders at the same time.

1609
01:40:26.60 --> 01:40:28.88
He's talking about a physical example.

1610
01:40:28.88 --> 01:40:35.16
Guiding in the military is when you are marching, you line up with a person to your left

1611
01:40:35.16 --> 01:40:36.96
usually.

1612
01:40:36.96 --> 01:40:40.40
These people say no line up with a person to your left and the person to your right.

1613
01:40:40.40 --> 01:40:43.48
How the hell are you going to do that?

1614
01:40:43.48 --> 01:40:44.48
You'd not.

1615
01:40:44.48 --> 01:40:47.60
That's the answer.

1616
01:40:47.60 --> 01:40:57.82
Before the gun stopped a staff officer from division, a staff officer from division went

1617
01:40:57.82 --> 01:40:59.12
up on the line.

1618
01:40:59.12 --> 01:41:02.22
And here he says, I went up there in the heaviest of the action when fire was flying all

1619
01:41:02.22 --> 01:41:03.22
around us.

1620
01:41:03.22 --> 01:41:08.32
Polar walked around outside the wire at hill 660 and stopped that every dugout to talk

1621
01:41:08.32 --> 01:41:09.52
to some kid.

1622
01:41:09.52 --> 01:41:12.08
He'd say, how's things going there old man?

1623
01:41:12.08 --> 01:41:16.56
Just as if he'd come next door to borrow a couple of sugar.

1624
01:41:16.56 --> 01:41:18.92
Those kids thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened.

1625
01:41:18.92 --> 01:41:22.20
You'd think you'd been handing out $1,000 bills down the line and there was someplace

1626
01:41:22.20 --> 01:41:24.40
to spend them.

1627
01:41:24.40 --> 01:41:29.04
Polar had found one demoralized boy sitting stonely in his hole looking out with a tell

1628
01:41:29.04 --> 01:41:30.88
tale thousand yard stare.

1629
01:41:30.88 --> 01:41:32.48
He muttered over and over.

1630
01:41:32.48 --> 01:41:35.32
Colonel, we got to get the hell out of here.

1631
01:41:35.32 --> 01:41:37.28
That's no way to talk old man.

1632
01:41:37.28 --> 01:41:41.20
I'm going to let the boy a few paces to the rear and sat with him for 10 minutes or so.

1633
01:41:41.20 --> 01:41:43.48
Look old man, I want to go home too.

1634
01:41:43.48 --> 01:41:44.72
I'm not getting any younger.

1635
01:41:44.72 --> 01:41:46.84
Hell, I'm 45 years old.

1636
01:41:46.84 --> 01:41:47.84
You know that?

1637
01:41:47.84 --> 01:41:48.84
I got a family at home.

1638
01:41:48.84 --> 01:41:54.04
I know this dump is no good, but neither of us is going home until we lick these bastards.

1639
01:41:54.04 --> 01:41:59.16
We've got to make, we've got to help make our folks at home safe too.

1640
01:41:59.16 --> 01:42:02.32
I'll try and get you some hot chow up here old man.

1641
01:42:02.32 --> 01:42:14.68
So again, you just got a guy that's totally gets it.

1642
01:42:14.68 --> 01:42:15.84
Lots of heavy fighting.

1643
01:42:15.84 --> 01:42:19.40
They get plaster secured in February 1944.

1644
01:42:19.40 --> 01:42:24.72
Polar had a physical examination in the cape and the camp at Cape Gloster and aside from

1645
01:42:24.72 --> 01:42:28.80
a notation of a recent attack of malaria was found in perfect condition.

1646
01:42:28.80 --> 01:42:32.60
On the same day upon hearing rumored that one third of the veterans of Gwala Canal was to

1647
01:42:32.60 --> 01:42:37.84
be rotated back to the states, Polar wrote general Holcomb, the common dont in terms which

1648
01:42:37.84 --> 01:42:42.32
would have been appreciated by a Caesar or Napoleon.

1649
01:42:42.32 --> 01:42:48.20
It is respectfully requested that my present assignment to a combat unit be extended until

1650
01:42:48.20 --> 01:42:54.24
the downfall of the Japanese Empire.

1651
01:42:54.24 --> 01:42:58.44
Freaking gets them.

1652
01:42:58.44 --> 01:43:02.64
The division recouped in Drew placements, the first of the new weapons began to appear

1653
01:43:02.64 --> 01:43:03.64
in quantities.

1654
01:43:03.64 --> 01:43:07.24
The Springfield is almost disappeared now to Polar Sorrow.

1655
01:43:07.24 --> 01:43:11.04
He was interested in the first of a new style flame frower when an officer brought one

1656
01:43:11.04 --> 01:43:12.04
by.

1657
01:43:12.04 --> 01:43:18.28
The youngster proudly explained the work of the deadly torch and looked to Polar for approval.

1658
01:43:18.28 --> 01:43:21.88
Where's the bayonet fit on it?

1659
01:43:21.88 --> 01:43:25.08
The another like famous quote from Chestie Polar.

1660
01:43:25.08 --> 01:43:31.24
There's a flame frower but you need to put a bayonet fitting on it just in case.

1661
01:43:31.24 --> 01:43:41.16
He's counseling his officers about showing being brave and stepping up.

1662
01:43:41.16 --> 01:43:44.80
At the same time, here's the, here's the dichotomy.

1663
01:43:44.80 --> 01:43:48.28
He says, I don't want you to go up under the guns just for show.

1664
01:43:48.28 --> 01:43:51.52
It's only the idiots and green kids who think they're bulletproof, but if you don't

1665
01:43:51.52 --> 01:43:54.40
show some courage, your officers won't show it either.

1666
01:43:54.40 --> 01:43:56.68
And the kids will hang back.

1667
01:43:56.68 --> 01:44:03.12
It's that, it's that kind of an outfit that always has trouble.

1668
01:44:03.12 --> 01:44:04.12
Next we go.

1669
01:44:04.12 --> 01:44:07.88
Polar returned to Pavuvo to find a new stern the camps.

1670
01:44:07.88 --> 01:44:10.36
The Allied landings in France were expanding.

1671
01:44:10.36 --> 01:44:16.48
The new B-29s had begun to bomb Tokyo, Saipan and Falun, whole fleets of cargo ships had

1672
01:44:16.48 --> 01:44:20.56
brought the first division new equipment to Pavuvo and there was a word of an independent

1673
01:44:20.56 --> 01:44:23.000
role for the Marines in a new operation.

1674
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.96
General MacArthur would follow his own southern course on island hopping, but the core would

1675
01:44:27.96 --> 01:44:30.08
stab into the central Pacific.

1676
01:44:30.08 --> 01:44:34.68
Polar occurred hardly conceive of the scope of the new Marine Corps, which he had known

1677
01:44:34.68 --> 01:44:38.48
to as a force of a mere 19,000 as pre-war days.

1678
01:44:38.48 --> 01:44:43.44
They were now five divisions and, and a brigade in the Pacific and another division in training

1679
01:44:43.44 --> 01:44:47.44
in California, well over a hundred thousand men.

1680
01:44:47.44 --> 01:44:52.84
In late July, on that same day Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were nominated

1681
01:44:52.84 --> 01:44:57.36
for the coming elections back home, Marines landed on Guam.

1682
01:44:57.36 --> 01:45:01.80
A few days after Louis got the news.

1683
01:45:01.80 --> 01:45:06.52
Lieutenant Colonel Sam Polar had been killed, shot through the heart by a machine gunner's

1684
01:45:06.52 --> 01:45:08.52
bullet.

1685
01:45:08.52 --> 01:45:13.80
His intonates notice a new reserve in the Colonel in these days, but it was not long before

1686
01:45:13.80 --> 01:45:18.52
still another false report which added to the growing Polar legend.

1687
01:45:18.52 --> 01:45:24.84
As whispered that, when he got ordered of Sam's death, he had said grimly, those who lived

1688
01:45:24.84 --> 01:45:28.72
by the sword must die by the sword.

1689
01:45:28.72 --> 01:45:32.000
The loss of Sam had in fact touched Louis deeply.

1690
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.76
He covered it with silence and a hurry turning to other topics when officers spoke

1691
01:45:36.76 --> 01:45:39.36
of his brother's death.

1692
01:45:39.36 --> 01:45:45.56
On Pavu-vu, the division intensified its work and swed it at war games on the beaches

1693
01:45:45.56 --> 01:45:48.20
and in the palm groves, there was a new watchword.

1694
01:45:48.20 --> 01:45:57.56
The Pelaloo, the next target.

1695
01:45:57.56 --> 01:46:06.72
So his brother, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Polar was killed and he got word about.

1696
01:46:06.72 --> 01:46:12.28
Hundred-only-hundred-thousand Marines that might seem like a lot, but that's not a lot.

1697
01:46:12.28 --> 01:46:20.80
You consider the tasks they had before them.

1698
01:46:20.80 --> 01:46:26.08
So now they're heading to Pelaloo, the next target.

1699
01:46:26.08 --> 01:46:31.28
When the big fleet left for the Polars to follow the bombardment ships, there was but

1700
01:46:31.28 --> 01:46:33.36
a single somber note.

1701
01:46:33.36 --> 01:46:38.92
A board one of the vessels were stacks of many hundreds of white wooden crosses far more

1702
01:46:38.92 --> 01:46:44.16
than a two-day supply.

1703
01:46:44.16 --> 01:46:48.16
Two days from Pelaloo, there was a report from the underwater demolition teams who's

1704
01:46:48.16 --> 01:46:52.20
met at boldly swam into shore and inspected, jab defences.

1705
01:46:52.20 --> 01:46:56.80
Nothing serious they said the way would be cleared.

1706
01:46:56.80 --> 01:46:58.24
Polars' mind was not relieved.

1707
01:46:58.24 --> 01:47:08.88
He had never before felt pessimism at the opening of a battle.

1708
01:47:08.88 --> 01:47:12.000
Now we're starting the invasion.

1709
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
There was no moon.

1710
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.88
The sky was filled with stars and there was not a trace of cloud.

1711
01:47:16.88 --> 01:47:20.60
Toward the dawn of September 15, the transports had come into position.

1712
01:47:20.60 --> 01:47:24.80
All the horizon, the guns, the guns of the fleet spurred in fire.

1713
01:47:24.80 --> 01:47:31.12
For hours the thunder was unbroken, but as gray-edge sky, as gray-edge the sky, pace,

1714
01:47:31.12 --> 01:47:34.40
slowed and the fire became disultry.

1715
01:47:34.40 --> 01:47:39.92
The island was invisible.

1716
01:47:39.92 --> 01:47:44.52
The troops had breakfast before daylight, staking eggs again.

1717
01:47:44.52 --> 01:47:50.32
When the first of them came to the decks, the chain of the Polars lay in a black silhouette

1718
01:47:50.32 --> 01:47:52.32
across the sea.

1719
01:47:52.32 --> 01:47:58.40
There was a moderate swell, a breeze sprang up coming from the island of Pelaloo.

1720
01:47:58.40 --> 01:48:02.68
The guns broke into a full cry once more and the final shelling struck target.

1721
01:48:02.68 --> 01:48:06.44
The two assault battalions of the first Marines went aboard the big landing vehicles on

1722
01:48:06.44 --> 01:48:07.44
the decks.

1723
01:48:07.44 --> 01:48:11.52
The moths of the ships clanked open in the amphibious tractors were spewed forth, milling

1724
01:48:11.52 --> 01:48:15.16
as they formed lines ready to move forward toward the breach.

1725
01:48:15.16 --> 01:48:17.48
They were 4,000 yards out.

1726
01:48:17.48 --> 01:48:20.28
Vast flights of planes came over.

1727
01:48:20.28 --> 01:48:24.56
Weeling in from all directions, they dived, bombed and climbed over Pelaloo for an hour

1728
01:48:24.56 --> 01:48:30.48
or more and soon after the first of the bombs fell a slow, hesitant curtain gathered over

1729
01:48:30.48 --> 01:48:31.96
the land.

1730
01:48:31.96 --> 01:48:36.84
It seemed impossible that anything living could have endured, but at last as the assault began,

1731
01:48:36.84 --> 01:48:42.20
a puff of anti-aircraft smoke flowered in the sky and a plane dropped in flames.

1732
01:48:42.20 --> 01:48:45.76
Just before 830, the first wave started shoreward.

1733
01:48:45.76 --> 01:48:49.48
Pelaloo watched for the signal flag to dip from the yard arm of a control boat in his

1734
01:48:49.48 --> 01:48:50.48
front.

1735
01:48:50.48 --> 01:48:54.68
The amtrecks fomed away on the broad wakes.

1736
01:48:54.68 --> 01:49:00.36
At almost 830 precisely, the vehicle ground on the sand, Polar never forgot the scene.

1737
01:49:00.36 --> 01:49:05.36
I went up over the side as fast as I could, scrambled and ran like hell at least 25 yards

1738
01:49:05.36 --> 01:49:07.96
before I hit the beach flat down.

1739
01:49:07.96 --> 01:49:12.36
When I looked back to the amtrak, I saw 4 or 5 shells hit it all at once.

1740
01:49:12.36 --> 01:49:15.96
A few men were killed getting out too slow, but most of them were saved because they

1741
01:49:15.96 --> 01:49:18.12
got out before we stopped moving.

1742
01:49:18.12 --> 01:49:20.000
We lost our communications officer.

1743
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.24
His leg was blown off and he couldn't be saved.

1744
01:49:22.24 --> 01:49:24.36
I looked down the beach and saw a mess.

1745
01:49:24.36 --> 01:49:28.16
Every damned amtrak in our wave had been destroyed in the water by the enemy or shot

1746
01:49:28.16 --> 01:49:31.12
the pieces the minute it landed.

1747
01:49:31.12 --> 01:49:33.40
I tried to get a line set up for defense.

1748
01:49:33.40 --> 01:49:37.60
The wiremen were there fast as soon as I was doing their job without further orders.

1749
01:49:37.60 --> 01:49:40.88
And we lost several of them in the hop fire.

1750
01:49:40.88 --> 01:49:43.48
Every puttune leader was trying to form a line of his own.

1751
01:49:43.48 --> 01:49:44.92
Just as I was.

1752
01:49:44.92 --> 01:49:48.16
Runners were going up and down the beach as we tried to get organized.

1753
01:49:48.16 --> 01:49:53.80
That big promatory on my left hadn't been touched by all the ship's guns and planes.

1754
01:49:53.80 --> 01:49:58.36
And we got a whirlwind of machine gun and anti-tank fire.

1755
01:49:58.36 --> 01:50:03.28
Polar second battalion drove through a heavy growth of woods now torn by the shelling and

1756
01:50:03.28 --> 01:50:07.08
by 930 ad driven 350 yards ahead.

1757
01:50:07.08 --> 01:50:11.24
To the edge of the airfield, they tied on the line of the fifth Marines.

1758
01:50:11.24 --> 01:50:15.32
Casualties were reported as heavy but the trial of the second had only begun.

1759
01:50:15.32 --> 01:50:19.32
The new position was faced by an obstacle marked on none of the invasion maps.

1760
01:50:19.32 --> 01:50:25.48
A sheer coral ridge whose sides were honeycomb with Japanese positions from foxholes to

1761
01:50:25.48 --> 01:50:29.32
gigantic dugouts of reinforced steel and concrete.

1762
01:50:29.32 --> 01:50:35.44
Some of them with four levels, each of which could be closed off with steel doors.

1763
01:50:35.44 --> 01:50:46.68
For eight hours the regiment endured the most savage fighting of the Pacific War.

1764
01:50:46.68 --> 01:50:52.92
General Smith had come a short 1130 a.m.

1765
01:50:52.92 --> 01:50:56.92
When the phone line was spliced, spliced late in the afternoon and he talked with Polar

1766
01:50:56.92 --> 01:50:59.24
he had only one.

1767
01:50:59.24 --> 01:51:00.64
He had only a com report.

1768
01:51:00.64 --> 01:51:04.96
We're dug in solid and we've got the 01 phase line all right.

1769
01:51:04.96 --> 01:51:09.52
Polar night made no mention of especially heavy casualties or of need for help.

1770
01:51:09.52 --> 01:51:14.28
It was estimated that the first Marines had lost 500 men during the day.

1771
01:51:14.28 --> 01:51:18.72
The first water that had come ashore and oil drums and was foul.

1772
01:51:18.72 --> 01:51:26.64
Polar shouted his rage to the officers on the ships, bellowing for new supplies.

1773
01:51:26.64 --> 01:51:29.40
Here's Polar's report.

1774
01:51:29.40 --> 01:51:35.24
Enemy well dug in, opposition strong, little damage done by our preliminary fire, hard

1775
01:51:35.24 --> 01:51:39.36
fight ahead, casualties over 20%.

1776
01:51:39.36 --> 01:51:44.64
I've ordered no man to be evacuated unless from bullet or shell wounds, request further

1777
01:51:44.64 --> 01:51:58.88
supply, fresh water, are still und drinkable, men wretched.

1778
01:51:58.88 --> 01:52:03.04
Polar called division and talked with Colonel Seld in the chief of staff.

1779
01:52:03.04 --> 01:52:05.80
He remembered the year the conversation years later.

1780
01:52:05.80 --> 01:52:10.52
Johnny half my regiment has gone, I've got to have replacements if I'm to carry out division

1781
01:52:10.52 --> 01:52:12.92
orders tomorrow morning.

1782
01:52:12.92 --> 01:52:14.84
You know we have no replacements, Louis.

1783
01:52:14.84 --> 01:52:18.72
I told you before we came ashore that we should have at least one regiment reserve.

1784
01:52:18.72 --> 01:52:20.72
We're not fighting a third.

1785
01:52:20.72 --> 01:52:22.92
We're not fighting a third of the men we brought in.

1786
01:52:22.92 --> 01:52:26.20
All these damn specialists you brought.

1787
01:52:26.20 --> 01:52:27.96
Anything wrong with your orders, Louis?

1788
01:52:27.96 --> 01:52:28.96
No.

1789
01:52:28.96 --> 01:52:32.24
I'm ready to go ahead, but you know my casualties are 50%.

1790
01:52:32.24 --> 01:52:33.56
What do you want me to do?

1791
01:52:33.56 --> 01:52:36.44
Give me some of those 17,000 men on the beach.

1792
01:52:36.44 --> 01:52:40.88
You can't have them, they're not trained in for infantry, given to me and by nightfall

1793
01:52:40.88 --> 01:52:43.88
tomorrow they'll be trained in infantry.

1794
01:52:43.88 --> 01:52:48.32
Polar went out with a runner stumbling through the night to find post of his battalion commanders

1795
01:52:48.32 --> 01:52:49.64
and pass on the order.

1796
01:52:49.64 --> 01:52:58.60
We press attack at 80 clock in the morning, no change, full speed, use every man.

1797
01:52:58.60 --> 01:53:02.000
He fell more than once and cut himself on the coral.

1798
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.20
He left for an order and others left at headquarters noticed that the Colonel was beginning

1799
01:53:06.20 --> 01:53:10.12
to limp and that his left leg is swollen.

1800
01:53:10.12 --> 01:53:11.92
Seldon called back, pulled in.

1801
01:53:11.92 --> 01:53:13.52
You got my orders okay?

1802
01:53:13.52 --> 01:53:15.80
Yes, you need an explain further.

1803
01:53:15.80 --> 01:53:17.80
I just came back from my battalions.

1804
01:53:17.80 --> 01:53:20.76
We're going to take ground tomorrow without replacements.

1805
01:53:20.76 --> 01:53:30.32
We're willing to try, but don't forget we're just going to add 10 or 15% to our casualties.

1806
01:53:30.32 --> 01:53:35.52
In the sun rose on September 18th, 200 of the 473 men in Polar's third battalion were

1807
01:53:35.52 --> 01:53:40.64
headquarters personnel, many frontline units had been decimated.

1808
01:53:40.64 --> 01:53:46.08
Long before noon, there were cases of heat prostration, the blazing sun was hotter than ever.

1809
01:53:46.08 --> 01:53:48.48
Faces and lips were cracked and bleeding.

1810
01:53:48.48 --> 01:53:51.04
Salt pills became scarce again.

1811
01:53:51.04 --> 01:53:55.24
Polar was optimistic, for they started the attack from high ground, but the crucial

1812
01:53:55.24 --> 01:53:58.08
days still lay ahead.

1813
01:53:58.08 --> 01:54:03.76
Tank atoms came by Polar's command post and found him half-clad and filthy, sweat soaked

1814
01:54:03.76 --> 01:54:08.48
trousers with a heavy beard on his face.

1815
01:54:08.48 --> 01:54:10.44
I'm coming back this afternoon, Colonel.

1816
01:54:10.44 --> 01:54:12.92
Do you want me to bring you a fresh uniform?

1817
01:54:12.92 --> 01:54:14.88
Hell, Hank, I've got no time for that.

1818
01:54:14.88 --> 01:54:18.92
Every man in the outfit will get clean before I do.

1819
01:54:18.92 --> 01:54:23.84
Lieutenant Colonel Lou Walt, now the executive officer of the fifth Marine saw Polar at

1820
01:54:23.84 --> 01:54:27.12
a command conference during the day.

1821
01:54:27.12 --> 01:54:39.84
He was absolutely sick over the loss of his men.

1822
01:54:39.84 --> 01:54:44.16
The enemy fought hand-to-hand until daylight, beating off charges that no survivor could

1823
01:54:44.16 --> 01:54:46.32
count.

1824
01:54:46.32 --> 01:54:50.52
As first light spilled over the ridge, the shrunken company beat back the last Japanese

1825
01:54:50.52 --> 01:54:57.08
attack with stones, ammunition boxes, bare fists, and bayonets.

1826
01:54:57.08 --> 01:55:02.80
Several of the enemy were flung bodily off the cliff and fell shrieking into the splintered

1827
01:55:02.80 --> 01:55:12.68
coral below.

1828
01:55:12.68 --> 01:55:15.16
But they did it.

1829
01:55:15.16 --> 01:55:22.40
At the end of the day, the regiment reported a total of 1,878 men lost since day.

1830
01:55:22.40 --> 01:55:26.88
The fighting went on without a break until September 23rd when the first Marines rested

1831
01:55:26.88 --> 01:55:29.84
in lines without advancing.

1832
01:55:29.84 --> 01:55:35.28
They beat off several counterattacks and patrols pushed out 1,000 yards down the west coast

1833
01:55:35.28 --> 01:55:38.000
without serious opposition.

1834
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:44.96
The regiment was relieved at 2pm of this day by the 320 first regiment of the 81st Army

1835
01:55:44.96 --> 01:55:45.96
Division.

1836
01:55:45.96 --> 01:55:51.16
The new commander took one look at the forward command post Polar at a occupied and ordered

1837
01:55:51.16 --> 01:55:57.28
it moved more than 1,000 yards to the rear.

1838
01:55:57.28 --> 01:56:03.52
In nine days on the line, Polar's regiment had eliminated one major blockhouse and 144 defended

1839
01:56:03.52 --> 01:56:06.000
caves in lesser pill boxes.

1840
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.76
Division reported that 3,942 Japanese had been killed in the regiment's zone.

1841
01:56:11.76 --> 01:56:14.20
No enemy had been captured.

1842
01:56:14.20 --> 01:56:17.92
Polar's total casualty of men were 56%.

1843
01:56:17.92 --> 01:56:23.28
The highest regimental losses in the history of the corps.

1844
01:56:23.28 --> 01:56:26.44
First battalion had lost 71%.

1845
01:56:26.44 --> 01:56:30.84
The second 56% the third 55%.

1846
01:56:30.84 --> 01:56:36.04
Headquarters and weapons companies 32%.

1847
01:56:36.04 --> 01:56:40.92
General Smith, who walked the terrain after it was finally captured, said it seemed impossible

1848
01:56:40.92 --> 01:56:45.32
that men could have moved forward against the intricate and mutually supporting defenses.

1849
01:56:45.32 --> 01:56:48.52
The Japanese had set up.

1850
01:56:48.52 --> 01:56:53.36
It can only be explained as a reflection of the determination and aggressive leadership

1851
01:56:53.36 --> 01:57:05.28
of Colonel Polar.

1852
01:57:05.28 --> 01:57:10.44
Now, Polar, that's the last major combat for Polar.

1853
01:57:10.44 --> 01:57:12.68
Was it Pelaloo?

1854
01:57:12.68 --> 01:57:17.64
He ends up going back to the states for a bit and while he's back on the states, back

1855
01:57:17.64 --> 01:57:28.48
in the states, America drops the atomic bombs on Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the war is over

1856
01:57:28.48 --> 01:57:41.20
and shortly thereafter, they order General Polar to our Colonel Polar at this time to the

1857
01:57:41.20 --> 01:57:42.20
reserves.

1858
01:57:42.20 --> 01:57:51.28
Now, like I said, he didn't get along with some people, especially up the chain of command.

1859
01:57:51.28 --> 01:57:57.60
And he didn't want to be sent to the reserves because that's not what a career marine

1860
01:57:57.60 --> 01:57:58.60
wants to do.

1861
01:57:58.60 --> 01:57:59.96
So here we go back to the book.

1862
01:57:59.96 --> 01:58:03.20
Colonel, you've been ordered to reserve duty in New Orleans.

1863
01:58:03.20 --> 01:58:04.44
It's a big district.

1864
01:58:04.44 --> 01:58:09.44
You know, and very important to the corps.

1865
01:58:09.44 --> 01:58:11.56
Polar was not misled.

1866
01:58:11.56 --> 01:58:16.32
He realized what it meant to be shown to reserve duty into a side pocket.

1867
01:58:16.32 --> 01:58:21.56
Many marine career had ended that way.

1868
01:58:21.56 --> 01:58:25.36
One of the inevitable problems with the Marine Corps, and this is Polar talking, one

1869
01:58:25.36 --> 01:58:30.28
of the inevitable problems with the Marine Corps or any other military services that staff

1870
01:58:30.28 --> 01:58:34.08
officers take over the minute of war is ended.

1871
01:58:34.08 --> 01:58:38.52
The combat people run things when the chips are down and the country's life is at stake,

1872
01:58:38.52 --> 01:58:43.76
but when the gun stop, nobody's got use for a combat man.

1873
01:58:43.76 --> 01:58:45.64
The staff officers are like rats.

1874
01:58:45.64 --> 01:58:47.72
They stream out of hiding and take over.

1875
01:58:47.72 --> 01:58:48.72
It's true.

1876
01:58:48.72 --> 01:58:50.48
Just watch what happens to paperwork.

1877
01:58:50.48 --> 01:58:54.96
God in peacetime, they'll put out enough to sink a small, sized nation into the sea.

1878
01:58:54.96 --> 01:58:58.36
And when the war breaks out, most of it just naturally stops.

1879
01:58:58.36 --> 01:58:59.96
That's the way they do everything.

1880
01:58:59.96 --> 01:59:03.88
There must be a staff of people, of course, or we never get everything done.

1881
01:59:03.88 --> 01:59:07.60
But if we don't stop this empire building of staff, somebody's going to come along

1882
01:59:07.60 --> 01:59:14.60
and lick us one of these days will be so nodded and red-daped that we can't move.

1883
01:59:14.60 --> 01:59:27.84
Well, we've never seen that seal-team thing.

1884
01:59:27.84 --> 01:59:33.76
You put it on a T-shirt or something, but it's Freddy the frog, the little symbol of the frog

1885
01:59:33.76 --> 01:59:37.56
man, the Freddy the frog, and he's like in a glass jar.

1886
01:59:37.56 --> 01:59:40.12
Or a glass casing.

1887
01:59:40.12 --> 01:59:44.92
And it says in case of war break glass, because you don't want the guy around when peacetime

1888
01:59:44.92 --> 01:59:45.92
is going on.

1889
01:59:45.92 --> 01:59:46.92
Right.

1890
01:59:46.92 --> 01:59:47.92
That's what that's what chess.

1891
01:59:47.92 --> 01:59:50.04
That's another chess-ty-puller, right?

1892
01:59:50.04 --> 01:59:55.88
They don't want him during peacetime, because he's...causes, he speaks up.

1893
01:59:55.88 --> 02:00:00.16
Well, peacetime lasts that long.

1894
02:00:00.16 --> 02:00:05.48
On June 25th, 1950, North Korean troops poured across the 38th Paradella in strength and

1895
02:00:05.48 --> 02:00:07.84
war had returned.

1896
02:00:07.84 --> 02:00:09.44
Polar recognized all the signs.

1897
02:00:09.44 --> 02:00:13.52
He immediately asked for a modification of his orders and said urgently to headquarters

1898
02:00:13.52 --> 02:00:17.56
attention is invited to the fact that I served as an officer in Haiti in Nicaragua and

1899
02:00:17.56 --> 02:00:22.40
in the Pacific Theater for eight years prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, this

1900
02:00:22.40 --> 02:00:30.000
experience will prove a value in an assignment to combat duty in Korea.

1901
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:36.08
Well, the senior personnel know that and he gets what he asked for.

1902
02:00:36.08 --> 02:00:40.44
Polar arrived in Southern California in the heat of late July and found San Diego in

1903
02:00:40.44 --> 02:00:41.92
area of Bedlam.

1904
02:00:41.92 --> 02:00:46.18
Marine reservists thronged in every corner of the nation's thousands of vehicle

1905
02:00:46.18 --> 02:00:49.92
storage since World War II were being overhauled and driven to port.

1906
02:00:49.92 --> 02:00:53.96
Trains bore regulars from the east coast, unattached officers came from everywhere without

1907
02:00:53.96 --> 02:00:56.68
a call volunteers for war.

1908
02:00:56.68 --> 02:01:02.32
The first Marine Division was being created almost from scratch.

1909
02:01:02.32 --> 02:01:07.78
So they had dismantled so much of the service after World War II and now they've got

1910
02:01:07.78 --> 02:01:09.92
to rebuild it all very quick.

1911
02:01:09.92 --> 02:01:10.92
They do.

1912
02:01:10.92 --> 02:01:11.92
They talk about it in the book.

1913
02:01:11.92 --> 02:01:16.64
I skip over that, but we know what that consists of hardcore training, getting people

1914
02:01:16.64 --> 02:01:17.96
ready for war.

1915
02:01:17.96 --> 02:01:24.76
Finally, they get, he gets to Japan and they're waiting now to go in Korea into Korea.

1916
02:01:24.76 --> 02:01:28.08
Polar hailed a passing medical corpsman and went to a nearby army hospital.

1917
02:01:28.08 --> 02:01:29.68
I want to talk with some of the casualties.

1918
02:01:29.68 --> 02:01:32.48
I've got to find out what's happening in Korea.

1919
02:01:32.48 --> 02:01:37.000
He went up in an elevator with an army doctor who seemed on point on the point of tears,

1920
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.88
going to the words and see those kids and you'll soon know more about more than you

1921
02:01:40.88 --> 02:01:43.04
want about Korea.

1922
02:01:43.04 --> 02:01:47.32
Take a look at all the self-inflicted wounds we've got and those kids are so green.

1923
02:01:47.32 --> 02:01:52.52
They don't even realize how obvious it is, just from the powder burns.

1924
02:01:52.52 --> 02:01:57.88
Polar walked down many rows of beds, talking with the men, many of them frightened and broken

1925
02:01:57.88 --> 02:02:00.68
and heard their tales of Korea.

1926
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:04.28
Polar was sobered, but not despair.

1927
02:02:04.28 --> 02:02:08.36
He told some young, younger officers that night, there's nothing wrong with American

1928
02:02:08.36 --> 02:02:09.36
kids.

1929
02:02:09.36 --> 02:02:12.92
Their leadership has just all gone to hell.

1930
02:02:12.92 --> 02:02:16.80
There's a whole hospital full of babies you might say.

1931
02:02:16.80 --> 02:02:18.80
They were never given a chance to grow into men.

1932
02:02:18.80 --> 02:02:24.36
It won't be that way with our Marines.

1933
02:02:24.36 --> 02:02:26.72
I'll tell you that.

1934
02:02:26.72 --> 02:02:33.88
You're prepared for D-Day in Inchon, to one of the biggest amphibious operations.

1935
02:02:33.88 --> 02:02:39.68
They're getting ready for that and he has a little chat with his officers.

1936
02:02:39.68 --> 02:02:42.32
We're the most fortunate of men.

1937
02:02:42.32 --> 02:02:46.32
Most time, professional soldiers have to wait 25 years or more for a war.

1938
02:02:46.32 --> 02:02:50.44
But here we are with only five years wait for this one.

1939
02:02:50.44 --> 02:02:53.64
During that time, we've sat on our fat, duff, strong, or pay.

1940
02:02:53.64 --> 02:02:57.28
Now we're getting a chance to earn it to show the taxpayers where a worth it.

1941
02:02:57.28 --> 02:03:01.12
We're going to work at our trade for a little while.

1942
02:03:01.12 --> 02:03:05.24
We live by the sword and if necessary, we'll be ready to die by the sword.

1943
02:03:05.24 --> 02:03:06.24
Good luck.

1944
02:03:06.24 --> 02:03:10.64
I'll see you ashore.

1945
02:03:10.64 --> 02:03:12.92
And listen up old men.

1946
02:03:12.92 --> 02:03:16.20
You have something to say to your officers or men, make it snappy.

1947
02:03:16.20 --> 02:03:18.28
The fewer words the better.

1948
02:03:18.28 --> 02:03:22.48
They won't believe it if you shoot bull.

1949
02:03:22.48 --> 02:03:27.16
When you face ranks of men and try that, you can hear them sign despair when you open

1950
02:03:27.16 --> 02:03:30.80
your mouth if they sense you're a phony.

1951
02:03:30.80 --> 02:03:32.68
They can usually look at you and tell.

1952
02:03:32.68 --> 02:03:40.72
Maybe it doesn't sound like it, but it's an important thing in a Marines career.

1953
02:03:40.72 --> 02:03:42.20
Don't try and.

1954
02:03:42.20 --> 02:03:43.64
Don't try and what does he call it?

1955
02:03:43.64 --> 02:03:44.64
Shoot bull.

1956
02:03:44.64 --> 02:03:46.24
Don't try and shoot bull.

1957
02:03:46.24 --> 02:03:48.04
Tell the boys what's going on for real.

1958
02:03:48.04 --> 02:03:51.64
They see right through you.

1959
02:03:51.64 --> 02:03:53.88
Road is wife a letter before he leaves.

1960
02:03:53.88 --> 02:03:55.92
Sweet.

1961
02:03:55.92 --> 02:04:02.12
I will be unable to write you again for a few days, but you, Virginia, Virginia, Mac,

1962
02:04:02.12 --> 02:04:06.16
Martha Lee and Lewis, those are his kids.

1963
02:04:06.16 --> 02:04:08.88
We'll be constantly in my thoughts.

1964
02:04:08.88 --> 02:04:14.80
And they God bless you, always, and provide for you, giving you much happiness and useful

1965
02:04:14.80 --> 02:04:17.12
lives.

1966
02:04:17.12 --> 02:04:22.24
You, my children, must take advantage of all opportunities and develop into good Christians,

1967
02:04:22.24 --> 02:04:24.20
much love to all of you.

1968
02:04:24.20 --> 02:04:26.000
I love you, Virginia.

1969
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.76
I always have.

1970
02:04:28.76 --> 02:04:36.16
And I always will.

1971
02:04:36.16 --> 02:04:39.92
You are going to in John.

1972
02:04:39.92 --> 02:04:44.04
By 530 in the afternoon when the first waves the Marines reach the shore, the men of

1973
02:04:44.04 --> 02:04:46.32
the fleet could no longer see in John.

1974
02:04:46.32 --> 02:04:51.16
Hundreds of boats milled in the outer harbor in their turn, crossing the embarkation line

1975
02:04:51.16 --> 02:04:55.76
and moving toward land where they disappeared into a bank of smoke and dust.

1976
02:04:55.76 --> 02:05:00.60
Pulling wind into his objective at Blue Beach with the third wave in a twilight hasened

1977
02:05:00.60 --> 02:05:05.76
but hastened by smoke, Paul, and climbed a 15 foot sea wall in one of the scaling ladders

1978
02:05:05.76 --> 02:05:14.000
improvised on a ship in route.

1979
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.08
They meet some fairly light resistance.

1980
02:05:18.08 --> 02:05:21.56
Here's what Pauler says, it won't amount to much tonight.

1981
02:05:21.56 --> 02:05:24.04
We took him by surprise.

1982
02:05:24.04 --> 02:05:28.04
Pauler's casualties had been light and the divisions total for the day was only 20 killed

1983
02:05:28.04 --> 02:05:31.04
in 170 wounded.

1984
02:05:31.04 --> 02:05:35.24
Pauler was awake at 330 a.m. calling the battalion commander making plans for an attack

1985
02:05:35.24 --> 02:05:37.64
at dawn.

1986
02:05:37.64 --> 02:05:42.72
Pauler's swift drive, hurried a joining forces in an effort to keep pace, capped and

1987
02:05:42.72 --> 02:05:50.32
raised styles of ridges battalion saw that the secret was not only in Pauler's incisive

1988
02:05:50.32 --> 02:05:51.32
orders.

1989
02:05:51.32 --> 02:05:54.24
He gave us pride in some way I can't describe.

1990
02:05:54.24 --> 02:05:56.84
All of us had heard hundreds of stories about him.

1991
02:05:56.84 --> 02:06:01.24
And today that we couldn't actually see him doing great things, he kept building up on

1992
02:06:01.24 --> 02:06:05.000
morale higher and higher just by being there.

1993
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.80
When we were moving up two companies from the adjoining battalions marched to breast and

1994
02:06:08.80 --> 02:06:13.56
got a little mixed, one of the kid yelled, one of the kids yelled, what, what outfit are

1995
02:06:13.56 --> 02:06:15.20
you with, Mac?

1996
02:06:15.20 --> 02:06:16.92
Fifth Marines, how about you?

1997
02:06:16.92 --> 02:06:18.28
I got a better.

1998
02:06:18.28 --> 02:06:20.68
I'm in Polars.

1999
02:06:20.68 --> 02:06:24.64
The troops in the first thought of the old man before they thought of their regimental

2000
02:06:24.64 --> 02:06:28.56
number.

2001
02:06:28.56 --> 02:06:33.20
By September 17th, D. Day plus two, General MacArthur was impatient to go ashore from

2002
02:06:33.20 --> 02:06:35.12
the command ship Mount McKinley.

2003
02:06:35.12 --> 02:06:39.56
He saw that his blow to Korea cut it into two and it taken the enemy by surprise and

2004
02:06:39.56 --> 02:06:45.08
that chances of ending the war were good.

2005
02:06:45.08 --> 02:06:50.40
He radioed Vice Admiral Arthur D. Strubel, the task force commander after the first

2006
02:06:50.40 --> 02:06:55.56
good news from shore, the Navy and Marines have never shown more brightly than this

2007
02:06:55.56 --> 02:07:05.48
morning, MacArthur.

2008
02:07:05.48 --> 02:07:10.08
On one of the fiery days of the drive towards Seoul, a popular chaplain, father, Keating,

2009
02:07:10.08 --> 02:07:15.04
captured five North Korean soldiers and herded them along as prisoners.

2010
02:07:15.04 --> 02:07:19.72
He hailed a passing Marine Jeep driven by private wolf.

2011
02:07:19.72 --> 02:07:23.76
On take these prisoners off my hands and get them to the rear before their hurt.

2012
02:07:23.76 --> 02:07:27.84
I can't father, I'm running ammo into the edge of town and they're getting low.

2013
02:07:27.84 --> 02:07:29.88
I can't stop to do it.

2014
02:07:29.88 --> 02:07:32.44
Private, that's an order.

2015
02:07:32.44 --> 02:07:34.44
Take them over.

2016
02:07:34.44 --> 02:07:37.84
Wolf looked rearward at the burning city.

2017
02:07:37.84 --> 02:07:40.24
You mean they're mine now under my responsibility?

2018
02:07:40.24 --> 02:07:42.44
Yes.

2019
02:07:42.44 --> 02:07:46.24
Wolf pulled up a light machine gun and sprayed the troops.

2020
02:07:46.24 --> 02:07:49.000
sprayed the group killing all five prisoners.

2021
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.84
The outraged Keating went to polar and demanded action.

2022
02:07:52.84 --> 02:07:58.04
Colonel Lisson's carefully ordered Wolf arrested and the priest went away, content that

2023
02:07:58.04 --> 02:08:00.48
he had done as duty.

2024
02:08:00.48 --> 02:08:06.68
Ten minutes later, polar acetone, what outfit was it that lost all those boys last night?

2025
02:08:06.68 --> 02:08:08.48
Barrow's company, sir.

2026
02:08:08.48 --> 02:08:09.48
All right.

2027
02:08:09.48 --> 02:08:15.04
Give that boy wolf a bar and send him up there.

2028
02:08:15.04 --> 02:08:20.20
Once took the story to his cronies as an example of the military justice at its best,

2029
02:08:20.20 --> 02:08:27.36
it spread through the outfit to become part of the polar legend.

2030
02:08:27.36 --> 02:08:31.20
Yeah.

2031
02:08:31.20 --> 02:08:32.60
Yeah.

2032
02:08:32.60 --> 02:08:36.44
That seems like a pretty square the way I think to do.

2033
02:08:36.44 --> 02:08:41.36
There's like a platoon that's getting completely destroyed and they've taken a bunch

2034
02:08:41.36 --> 02:08:45.000
of casualties and you got this kid that did something wrong.

2035
02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.08
And we could arrest him and put him in prison or whatever, and we could send him up to

2036
02:08:50.08 --> 02:08:51.08
fight.

2037
02:08:51.08 --> 02:08:56.84
Polar sons of up to fight.

2038
02:08:56.84 --> 02:09:03.96
In the seven days since D.A. there had been a 1,148 Marine casualties, 145 of these killed

2039
02:09:03.96 --> 02:09:08.92
20 more died of wounds and five were missing.

2040
02:09:08.92 --> 02:09:13.000
The North Koreans, Polar Sedan, his deep drawing voice are defending the city in such

2041
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.80
a way as to force us to destroy it.

2042
02:09:16.80 --> 02:09:18.72
There's a billion dollars worth of publicity in this.

2043
02:09:18.72 --> 02:09:22.40
So this is when they're trying to get into Seoul and the North Koreans are defending Seoul

2044
02:09:22.40 --> 02:09:34.000
very hard and polar basically has to get ultra aggressive in trying to take Seoul.

2045
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.08
Back to the book, the fire of artillery and mortars had set the record for the Korean war,

2046
02:09:38.08 --> 02:09:42.60
the four battalions of artillery had fired all shells at hand and had depleted and nearby

2047
02:09:42.60 --> 02:09:44.000
Army dump.

2048
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.48
The four point two mortars had fired 326 rounds and the big 81, 650 rounds.

2049
02:09:50.48 --> 02:09:55.64
The 50 caliber machine guns had used 120 boxes or 30,000 rounds.

2050
02:09:55.64 --> 02:10:00.28
The Knights battled, put Lieutenant Joe Fisher, Lieutenant Joe Fisher's item company to

2051
02:10:00.28 --> 02:10:01.52
the test.

2052
02:10:01.52 --> 02:10:05.72
Fisher dug in for the night on an isolated hill in the city's factory district, overlooking

2053
02:10:05.72 --> 02:10:08.16
the roadblock which was on his left flank.

2054
02:10:08.16 --> 02:10:13.24
The midnight to dawn he beat off waves of attack.

2055
02:10:13.24 --> 02:10:16.20
Fisher called for artillery at the same time.

2056
02:10:16.20 --> 02:10:18.56
Other frontline commanders asked for help.

2057
02:10:18.56 --> 02:10:24.12
But between barrages from the North Korean swept up Fisher's hill in a bonsai charges

2058
02:10:24.12 --> 02:10:28.48
urged by shrill force commanders in their rear.

2059
02:10:28.48 --> 02:10:33.000
Item companies weapons including machine guns fired at top speed and bodies piled up

2060
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.92
below them toward the end when the attacks weekend.

2061
02:10:35.92 --> 02:10:41.36
The fight turned into a turkey shoot and Fisher's men slaughtered the enemy.

2062
02:10:41.36 --> 02:10:43.32
They were glad to see the sunrise.

2063
02:10:43.32 --> 02:10:45.08
Fisher never forgot that daybreak.

2064
02:10:45.08 --> 02:10:49.56
I looked down the hill behind me and saw a man hurring up towards our position.

2065
02:10:49.56 --> 02:10:53.84
I could see that he wasn't lugging any ammunition and thought it must be an important message

2066
02:10:53.84 --> 02:10:56.52
too hot for the radio.

2067
02:10:56.52 --> 02:11:01.24
Then I saw that it was Colonel Polar's runner and he had brought us a bottle of black

2068
02:11:01.24 --> 02:11:03.28
and white scotch.

2069
02:11:03.28 --> 02:11:05.28
My God, were we glad to see that.

2070
02:11:05.28 --> 02:11:09.16
It was passed down to the Paltoon with the most casualties and they rationed out to those

2071
02:11:09.16 --> 02:11:11.28
who needed it most.

2072
02:11:11.28 --> 02:11:20.40
We knew then that the old man was thinking of us and in fact never forgot us.

2073
02:11:20.40 --> 02:11:25.28
Polar came upon Marines dug in around a barricade taken cover from fire down the street.

2074
02:11:25.28 --> 02:11:27.92
He walked among them with the pipe stub and his mouth.

2075
02:11:27.92 --> 02:11:29.68
Get up boys, get up and go.

2076
02:11:29.68 --> 02:11:31.48
That's the quickest way to get it over.

2077
02:11:31.48 --> 02:11:36.04
If you're going to get it, you can get it in holes too.

2078
02:11:36.04 --> 02:11:37.84
The line moved.

2079
02:11:37.84 --> 02:11:39.72
Joe Fisher saw Polar in the street.

2080
02:11:39.72 --> 02:11:42.16
He was going along where the fire was heaviest.

2081
02:11:42.16 --> 02:11:43.92
Just like he was back in Pendleton.

2082
02:11:43.92 --> 02:11:46.12
As if he didn't know there was a fight within miles.

2083
02:11:46.12 --> 02:11:50.40
I couldn't express how much good it did me and my troops to see him steady like that.

2084
02:11:50.40 --> 02:11:52.60
Just puffing that pipe.

2085
02:11:52.60 --> 02:11:55.08
It made us feel like we could do no less than he did.

2086
02:11:55.08 --> 02:11:59.28
If there has ever been another one like him in the Marine Corps, I never saw him in my

2087
02:11:59.28 --> 02:12:00.28
day.

2088
02:12:00.28 --> 02:12:10.44
Bill Faringo, the veteran who is the field sergeant major had a glimpse of the Colonel.

2089
02:12:10.44 --> 02:12:15.04
It was like going through hell passing down that soul street and who should we pass in

2090
02:12:15.04 --> 02:12:17.68
the middle of it but chesty.

2091
02:12:17.68 --> 02:12:20.40
It was so hot that I fought the grenades and ammunition.

2092
02:12:20.40 --> 02:12:21.88
We carried wood explode.

2093
02:12:21.88 --> 02:12:26.28
The flames almost met over our heads from the burning houses, but the Colonel didn't

2094
02:12:26.28 --> 02:12:27.84
seem in the least concerned.

2095
02:12:27.84 --> 02:12:36.84
It gave us an extra push.

2096
02:12:36.84 --> 02:12:39.68
One of the most they wrap up this in-challenged invasion.

2097
02:12:39.68 --> 02:12:42.40
One of the most demanding operations in Marine history had ended.

2098
02:12:42.40 --> 02:12:47.68
The division had sustained 2,430 casualties, 414 of them dead.

2099
02:12:47.68 --> 02:12:52.28
Of this total, 1,064 had been in the last five days in the streets of Seoul and its

2100
02:12:52.28 --> 02:12:54.000
outskirts.

2101
02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.92
His fifth Marines had the worst of it with 1,038 casualties, 177 dead.

2102
02:12:59.92 --> 02:13:04.80
Polar had a total of 787 with 92 dead.

2103
02:13:04.80 --> 02:13:12.56
Litsonberg, 368, 72 dead.

2104
02:13:12.56 --> 02:13:16.64
Polar wrote another letter to his wife.

2105
02:13:16.64 --> 02:13:20.92
Everything is quiet now and I have a little to do except get my reports prepared and submitted.

2106
02:13:20.92 --> 02:13:26.88
I wish I had a flare for writing, as then I am certain this regiment would get the credit

2107
02:13:26.88 --> 02:13:30.96
do when the history of this operation is finally written.

2108
02:13:30.96 --> 02:13:35.84
Now everyone knows, but in a few years what is written will govern.

2109
02:13:35.84 --> 02:13:40.40
Rest assured that I will do a better job of getting the facts in my reports than I did

2110
02:13:40.40 --> 02:13:42.12
in the past war.

2111
02:13:42.12 --> 02:13:44.84
I will also claim everything do the regiment.

2112
02:13:44.84 --> 02:13:48.80
Many times I have regretted that my English education was cut short during the first

2113
02:13:48.80 --> 02:13:50.20
war.

2114
02:13:50.20 --> 02:13:54.56
Please do your best to impress upon our children the necessity of taking advantage of every

2115
02:13:54.56 --> 02:14:03.32
opportunity in this hard old world of ours.

2116
02:14:03.32 --> 02:14:06.32
He recognized this sad thing.

2117
02:14:06.32 --> 02:14:08.12
It is the reality though.

2118
02:14:08.12 --> 02:14:12.68
If you are in a leadership position in the military, you have to be able to write well.

2119
02:14:12.68 --> 02:14:18.92
He regrets that he wasn't a little better at it.

2120
02:14:18.92 --> 02:14:26.68
Intention in the English class folks.

2121
02:14:26.68 --> 02:14:31.08
Polar Winners Shore, they were back at sea, Polar Winners Shore, and one of major treadwell's

2122
02:14:31.08 --> 02:14:35.48
landing craft to be met broadly by a grinning Oliver Smith.

2123
02:14:35.48 --> 02:14:37.76
Congratulations, Louis, you made it.

2124
02:14:37.76 --> 02:14:41.08
Your board has selected you for Brigadier.

2125
02:14:41.08 --> 02:14:42.28
Polar Wagged is head.

2126
02:14:42.28 --> 02:14:45.68
By God if it hadn't been for this war, I had never got in that star.

2127
02:14:45.68 --> 02:14:49.56
It was a mild celebration of Shore that night for the new general to be.

2128
02:14:49.56 --> 02:14:55.28
He picked up his first star, as a general.

2129
02:14:55.28 --> 02:14:59.16
Like he said, if it wasn't for the, you know, he'd been put down in some reserve unit

2130
02:14:59.16 --> 02:15:00.16
new Orleans.

2131
02:15:00.16 --> 02:15:02.24
He wasn't going to make general there.

2132
02:15:02.24 --> 02:15:05.28
But the case of war, break glass.

2133
02:15:05.28 --> 02:15:06.84
Now he makes general.

2134
02:15:06.84 --> 02:15:08.000
Polar wrote home daily.

2135
02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.56
He sent Virginia $5 check for her good school in Mark.

2136
02:15:11.56 --> 02:15:16.20
You're good school marks, adding some parental advice.

2137
02:15:16.20 --> 02:15:21.72
I'm very proud of my family and expected to do well plus in everything you undertake.

2138
02:15:21.72 --> 02:15:27.92
The difference between success and failure in this life of ours is mostly hard work.

2139
02:15:27.92 --> 02:15:32.52
So you must constantly work to try and improve yourself.

2140
02:15:32.52 --> 02:15:38.32
I think we could just frame that statement.

2141
02:15:38.32 --> 02:15:44.20
On November 10th, the Marine Corps's birthday, Polar used a captured North Korean sword to slice

2142
02:15:44.20 --> 02:15:46.84
a hundred pound cake.

2143
02:15:46.84 --> 02:15:54.84
He shouted to his troops after he got done delivering the article from a manual.

2144
02:15:54.84 --> 02:15:58.72
He shouted out, now that that's complied with, I want to tell you something straight.

2145
02:15:58.72 --> 02:16:00.28
Just do one thing for me.

2146
02:16:00.28 --> 02:16:04.08
Write your people back home and tell them there's one hell of a damn war going on

2147
02:16:04.08 --> 02:16:08.72
out here and that the Raggedy-tailed North Koreans have been whipping a lot of so-called

2148
02:16:08.72 --> 02:16:11.000
Get-American troops and may do it again.

2149
02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.76
Tell them there's no secret weapon for our country but to get hard to get in there

2150
02:16:14.76 --> 02:16:15.76
and fight.

2151
02:16:15.76 --> 02:16:18.04
I want you to make them understand.

2152
02:16:18.04 --> 02:16:21.84
Our country won't go on forever if we stay as soft as we are now.

2153
02:16:21.84 --> 02:16:28.000
There won't be any America because some foreign soldier would invade us and take our

2154
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.76
women and breed a hard year race.

2155
02:16:30.76 --> 02:16:36.52
Yeah, there you go.

2156
02:16:36.52 --> 02:16:37.52
He's not playing around.

2157
02:16:37.52 --> 02:16:40.32
Is it interesting that we hear the same things now?

2158
02:16:40.32 --> 02:16:49.000
Like, America's getting soft and that's what Polar was, General Polar was saying.

2159
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.84
After the Marines had taken soul, the 8th Army of the United Nations forces had driven

2160
02:16:52.84 --> 02:16:56.76
through the capital moving rapidly northward along the Korean coasts.

2161
02:16:56.76 --> 02:17:01.56
To meet them, Chinese Communist armies had marched 1,800 miles northward since

2162
02:17:01.56 --> 02:17:02.92
Migrant Mid-August.

2163
02:17:02.92 --> 02:17:08.32
The Chinese strategist had first concentrated against the 8th Army position in the northwest

2164
02:17:08.32 --> 02:17:13.08
and hills but when the Marines landed, they hurriedly switched much of the power to meet

2165
02:17:13.08 --> 02:17:17.92
the meat and overwhelm them in the chosen reservoir.

2166
02:17:17.92 --> 02:17:22.20
The Chinese drove between the Marines and the 8th Army and maneuvered into a position

2167
02:17:22.20 --> 02:17:27.48
from which they could attack each force at will.

2168
02:17:27.48 --> 02:17:37.08
So, podcast number 53, colders in hell is about the chosen reservoir and there's another

2169
02:17:37.08 --> 02:17:43.32
one I forget the number but we've done two podcasts about the chosen reservoir.

2170
02:17:43.32 --> 02:17:44.32
Listen to those.

2171
02:17:44.32 --> 02:17:48.76
I'm going to touch on it here as well.

2172
02:17:48.76 --> 02:17:52.56
On the hills on every side of the perimeter, Chinese fire was heavy during the day.

2173
02:17:52.56 --> 02:17:57.000
The enemy blew a tunnel and a bridge on the railroad below, co-to-re-position, cutting

2174
02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.60
the line to ham-hung and the Marine basins on the sea.

2175
02:18:01.60 --> 02:18:06.40
For two days, Polar called in heavy air strikes upon concentrations of Chinese in the

2176
02:18:06.40 --> 02:18:08.60
surrounding hills.

2177
02:18:08.60 --> 02:18:12.08
Things were even worse than the two positions to the north of Polar.

2178
02:18:12.08 --> 02:18:16.82
At least six Chinese divisions had been identified in the area where Murray and Litson

2179
02:18:16.82 --> 02:18:18.44
Berg fought.

2180
02:18:18.44 --> 02:18:27.36
On November 26, these two posts lost 95 dead and 543 wounded in night long attacks.

2181
02:18:27.36 --> 02:18:32.000
Haggaru was preparing to fight for its life.

2182
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.96
An offensive launched by the fifth Marines was called off after the day's grim news from

2183
02:18:36.96 --> 02:18:37.96
the west.

2184
02:18:37.96 --> 02:18:41.48
The 8th Army had collapsed.

2185
02:18:41.48 --> 02:18:46.48
One wing of it was torn to pieces and the Chinese were slashing deep into the lines.

2186
02:18:46.48 --> 02:18:52.12
This must now defend themselves in an enemy free, against an enemy free to approach from

2187
02:18:52.12 --> 02:18:57.52
any direction through the frozen mountains.

2188
02:18:57.52 --> 02:19:04.16
The night of November 27 tested the men at Udomni when the three Chinese division

2189
02:19:04.16 --> 02:19:07.60
divisions fell upon two Marine regiments.

2190
02:19:07.60 --> 02:19:12.76
The enemy cut the road to Haggaru and sent their assault battalions in quilted uniforms

2191
02:19:12.76 --> 02:19:16.88
and sneakers into the Marine lines with disregard for casualties.

2192
02:19:16.88 --> 02:19:21.64
The first waves were driven off with great losses but the others were thrown into thrown

2193
02:19:21.64 --> 02:19:24.16
in through the night and the next.

2194
02:19:24.16 --> 02:19:29.20
To the dismay of the Chinese commanders, not even the development of Marine command post

2195
02:19:29.20 --> 02:19:34.28
slowed the tempo of fighting and the American stage vicious counter attacks even when many

2196
02:19:34.28 --> 02:19:37.52
platoons had been reduced to the size of squads.

2197
02:19:37.52 --> 02:19:42.52
There were not enough tent from Marine wounded and the less seriously hurt were piled

2198
02:19:42.52 --> 02:19:49.36
outside close together for warmth covered with straw as doctors worked over the more than

2199
02:19:49.36 --> 02:19:55.64
500 casualties.

2200
02:19:55.64 --> 02:20:01.44
It now became clear that the three Marine positions in the chosen area were surrounded.

2201
02:20:01.44 --> 02:20:07.16
Polar's reaction to the dread news was given to newspaper men who flew into Coatoree.

2202
02:20:07.16 --> 02:20:11.16
There's what Polar said, we've been looking for the enemy for several days now, we finally

2203
02:20:11.16 --> 02:20:14.12
found them, we're surrounded.

2204
02:20:14.12 --> 02:20:18.20
That simplifies our problem of getting these people and killing them.

2205
02:20:18.20 --> 02:20:28.12
Yeah, you wonder, there's no wonder why this guy's a legend.

2206
02:20:28.12 --> 02:20:32.60
Polar prepared to open the road to Haggaru with Task Force Drysdale, a British commando

2207
02:20:32.60 --> 02:20:38.36
unit of Royal Marines under Lieutenant Douglas Drysdale accompanied by Captain Carl Citer's

2208
02:20:38.36 --> 02:20:44.84
company of Ridges Battalion and a company from the 31st Army Regiment which had come in.

2209
02:20:44.84 --> 02:20:49.56
The road had been blocked in several places, two bridges were out and the Chinese squarmed

2210
02:20:49.56 --> 02:20:53.000
on heights overlooking the route.

2211
02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:58.76
The party met bitter opposition and within a few minutes had 14 casualties in three hours

2212
02:20:58.76 --> 02:21:03.88
and half, three hours and a half, they moved only two miles with eight more to go.

2213
02:21:03.88 --> 02:21:08.92
Polar sent tanks to support and men came down from the hills to walk with them.

2214
02:21:08.92 --> 02:21:13.08
They fought through road blocks and around a blown bridge but a dusk in narrowed

2215
02:21:13.08 --> 02:21:14.84
defile.

2216
02:21:14.84 --> 02:21:19.48
The metronam bush and took serious casualties.

2217
02:21:19.48 --> 02:21:24.76
By radio, Polar, Oliver Smith and Drysdale agreed that the unit must push on to Haggaru

2218
02:21:24.76 --> 02:21:32.68
whatever the cost. The Royal Marines finally reached Haggaru perimeter at 1.30am with 90 of its 255

2219
02:21:32.68 --> 02:21:38.12
men casualties. Citer had 63, only 70 of the 210 Army men made it.

2220
02:21:39.80 --> 02:21:45.40
A truck column sent behind this ill-fated party was virtually destroyed after a long fight

2221
02:21:45.40 --> 02:21:50.60
and parlay with the Chinese who captured all the trucks and most of the men.

2222
02:21:50.60 --> 02:21:57.08
The survivors of this party were crucial to the defense of Haggaru.

2223
02:21:57.08 --> 02:22:01.40
They're added firepower, helped turn back another massive Chinese attack.

2224
02:22:01.40 --> 02:22:06.76
The companies of Citer and Joe Fisher killed the enemy in droves and by the next dawn,

2225
02:22:06.76 --> 02:22:09.48
their lines, they'll bent, had held.

2226
02:22:09.48 --> 02:22:22.12
On the night of December 7, the bulk of the division was in Polar's perimeter after the 38-hour

2227
02:22:22.12 --> 02:22:29.72
battle from Haggaru. The cost 103 dead, 506 wounded, 7 missing.

2228
02:22:29.72 --> 02:22:36.84
But now the force of 10,000 and its 1000 vehicles was at Citerri. The perimeter could hardly

2229
02:22:36.84 --> 02:22:46.28
contain them all. After supper, the Colonel disappeared. Only Sergeant Jones and I haven't

2230
02:22:46.28 --> 02:22:52.04
mentioned much about Sergeant Jones. He's like, he's, he's Polar's right hand man through this

2231
02:22:52.04 --> 02:22:57.88
through all kinds of crazy stuff. And Sergeant Jones, only Sergeant Jones knew where he was.

2232
02:22:57.88 --> 02:23:02.12
The old man would sneak off with Body and go up into the lines, climbing right up into those

2233
02:23:02.12 --> 02:23:07.16
dams, straight up hills, all the ice and rock going from hold to hole for half the night. He would

2234
02:23:07.16 --> 02:23:11.48
go to every man he could find in a fox hole and say, how you doing old man, what's your field

2235
02:23:11.48 --> 02:23:16.84
of fire? Who's on your flank? You getting enough chow? On the way back, he would check the warming

2236
02:23:16.84 --> 02:23:23.48
tense to see if there'd been casualties and how the men were doing. Early on December 8,

2237
02:23:23.48 --> 02:23:29.48
the Marines began clearing the ridges on either side of the road, south, but the going was slow

2238
02:23:29.48 --> 02:23:36.84
and the trucks bearing the bridge sections made little project progress. A funeral for 117

2239
02:23:36.84 --> 02:23:43.24
Marines in a common grave brought the day to an end in the perimeter. It was a scene that lived

2240
02:23:43.24 --> 02:23:48.52
in Polar's memory, the burial of frozen bodies by a tank battalion which crushed them under

2241
02:23:48.52 --> 02:23:55.32
frozen ground. A Marine photographer took movies of the burial. Polar said, how I wish our

2242
02:23:55.32 --> 02:24:03.08
people could have seen the site to see just what happened to us in Korea. He later heard that army

2243
02:24:03.08 --> 02:24:16.52
censorship in Washington kept the film from the public. And now they're, again, that's very

2244
02:24:16.52 --> 02:24:20.76
compressed story, but they're breaking out and they're heading south, getting heading back to the

2245
02:24:20.76 --> 02:24:27.24
scene back to safety out of the out of being surrounded. Back to the book, the 5th and 7th

2246
02:24:27.24 --> 02:24:31.32
Marines had now passed through Polar's ranks and the first was the rear guard for the entire

2247
02:24:31.32 --> 02:24:35.16
division responsible for covering the withdrawal down the frozen loops of the road.

2248
02:24:36.20 --> 02:24:42.52
Polar started down and hundreds of men saw him for he thought that his job had only begun.

2249
02:24:42.52 --> 02:24:47.88
He shouted to every passing unit to cheer the men yelling until he was horse. Don't forget

2250
02:24:47.88 --> 02:24:51.96
that your first Marines, not all the communists and hell can overrun you.

2251
02:25:02.68 --> 02:25:10.60
When he got back, reporters found him and they wanted a statement from him. And he said,

2252
02:25:10.60 --> 02:25:16.04
remember, whatever you write, this was no retreat. All that happened was we found more Chinese

2253
02:25:16.04 --> 02:25:29.08
behind us than in front of us so we about faced and attacked. Smith recommended Polar for a

2254
02:25:29.08 --> 02:25:36.68
Navy Cross for his work in the reservoir campaign. His fifth and a Marine Corps record.

2255
02:25:38.12 --> 02:25:42.36
Polar's letter to his wife revealed his unusual concern for his family and the midst of the

2256
02:25:42.36 --> 02:25:47.000
campaigning. Please tell Lewis that's his son. Please tell Lewis that I will finally come home

2257
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.44
and teach him how to shoot and many other things that boys and men must know. Tell him to be patient

2258
02:25:52.44 --> 02:25:57.80
and the swords and the helmet I send him will arrive. Tell him to change his bait in the rabbit

2259
02:25:57.80 --> 02:26:03.16
trap every few days. A piece of apple lettuce carrot celery turn up and he must not go near the

2260
02:26:03.16 --> 02:26:08.76
trap or touch it except to change the bait when the door is sprung. Also he must keep the dog away from it.

2261
02:26:08.76 --> 02:26:20.04
20 still on his boy. He continues on and a letter to his wife. I haven't minded the hardships

2262
02:26:20.04 --> 02:26:25.88
here but the killing and crippling of young men is awful. Due to the weather, our wounded die,

2263
02:26:25.88 --> 02:26:31.88
blood plasma freezes before it can be administered. I realized that this war is for harder

2264
02:26:31.88 --> 02:26:37.64
on you than it has beyond me than it has been on me and I'm sorry to have caused you all the worry

2265
02:26:37.64 --> 02:26:46.76
and pain. And he goes on to say, the Pentagon is largely responsible for this mess out here.

2266
02:26:46.76 --> 02:26:52.36
They weren't even given. They were given the money to provide us and train an army. When I entered

2267
02:26:52.36 --> 02:26:57.88
the service, the regulation stated that the object of all military training is success in battle.

2268
02:27:00.04 --> 02:27:05.16
This short sentence has been rewritten on three pages and I defy anyone to read over three or

2269
02:27:05.16 --> 02:27:08.76
more times and then explained to me what the object of military training is.

2270
02:27:10.68 --> 02:27:18.04
Even the Pentagon has not the slightest idea why they're commanding forces of the United States.

2271
02:27:18.92 --> 02:27:22.20
In fact out here, we wonder if we are part of the United States.

2272
02:27:24.92 --> 02:27:29.32
And here he talks about his son again telling his wife, I will not influence my son as

2273
02:27:29.32 --> 02:27:36.36
to choosing a profession. It will be up to him. I will not even recommend the service. I've

2274
02:27:36.36 --> 02:27:41.72
had to stand with my mouth closed on too many occasions and then carry out orders from too many

2275
02:27:41.72 --> 02:27:50.12
half-wits. So as much as he loves the Marine Corps and the military in the country, he's saying

2276
02:27:50.12 --> 02:28:02.28
look, I might not even, I'm not going to even recommend that my son joins. He gets his pinning of his

2277
02:28:02.28 --> 02:28:07.56
star. Finally, he's actually being officially made a general and he makes a speech. All the credit

2278
02:28:07.56 --> 02:28:14.60
for this star belongs to the non-combs, junior officers and enlisted men. You all know that.

2279
02:28:14.60 --> 02:28:20.68
I've tried to do my duty, but we'd never get anywhere except for you fellows in the ranks. This is a

2280
02:28:20.68 --> 02:28:27.64
great regimen and it's going to hurt me to leave you. I'll never forget you. To the man of task force,

2281
02:28:27.64 --> 02:28:33.72
polar, he also issued a formal memorandum in compliance with orders. I am today leaving this command

2282
02:28:33.72 --> 02:28:39.80
for assignment as division commander, assistant division commander. It is not without misgivings

2283
02:28:39.80 --> 02:28:45.16
and a certain reluctance that I carry out these orders. All of you officers in mental like

2284
02:28:45.16 --> 02:28:52.44
realize I am sure what the first Marine regimen has meant to me. I ask one more thing of you.

2285
02:28:52.44 --> 02:28:57.48
Give my successor the same full measure of cooperation and willingness. You have always given me

2286
02:28:57.48 --> 02:29:04.60
and the first Marines will be worthy of the name it is already one. I first commanded you on new

2287
02:29:04.60 --> 02:29:11.80
Britain later on the bloody hills of Peleu and it has been my honor to command you in Korea

2288
02:29:11.80 --> 02:29:17.48
where by your deeds you captured the city of Seoul then successfully covered the withdrawal of

2289
02:29:17.48 --> 02:29:25.08
our division from the chosen reservoir area. I shall look to future to your future movements and

2290
02:29:25.08 --> 02:29:37.72
shall expect to hear and see still greater deeds and higher reputation one on the field of battle.

2291
02:29:46.12 --> 02:29:50.12
I talked a little bit about the dichotomy and his reputation.

2292
02:29:50.12 --> 02:29:58.60
Pollars reputation grew among the men but Sergeant Jones noted that the old man was regarded as a

2293
02:29:58.60 --> 02:30:06.28
man-eater. They would ask Bodian me over and over how the hell we kept our stripes. They thought he

2294
02:30:06.28 --> 02:30:11.40
chewed on people all the time and when there was a fight recklessly exposed his people.

2295
02:30:12.76 --> 02:30:19.24
And of course we knew better. It was hard to convince guys who had heard so much about him but didn't

2296
02:30:19.24 --> 02:30:25.88
really know him. When you got close to him you found he had a heart as big as all outdoors.

2297
02:30:34.52 --> 02:30:40.68
They continued to not make friends up the chain of command. We can't help to win. We can't

2298
02:30:40.68 --> 02:30:45.32
hope to win future wars and we got the hell beat out of us in Korea unless we have discipline

2299
02:30:45.32 --> 02:30:53.80
and it's going to take some brutality to get it. As last days in Korea we're frustrating to

2300
02:30:53.80 --> 02:31:00.04
pull her who found things suddenly different. He wrote his wife. Now age has probably changed me.

2301
02:31:00.44 --> 02:31:07.48
And the core has changed too. I suppose to man being what he is today. I never thought this change

2302
02:31:07.48 --> 02:31:19.56
could or would happen. Maybe I have been wrong from the beginning. Now he gets back to America.

2303
02:31:20.60 --> 02:31:26.44
And of course there's a big bunch of reporters waiting for him and they kind of know they kind of know

2304
02:31:26.44 --> 02:31:33.40
he's got a mouth right so they're they're fired up to talk to him. And

2305
02:31:33.40 --> 02:31:41.96
he starts talking to the reporters and here we go. What the American people want to do is fight

2306
02:31:41.96 --> 02:31:47.88
a war without getting hurt. You can't do that anymore than you can go into a bar room

2307
02:31:47.88 --> 02:31:52.92
brawl without getting hurt. Unless the American people are willing to send their sons out to

2308
02:31:52.92 --> 02:31:58.84
fight in aggressor. There's just not going to be any United States. A bunch of foreign soldiers will

2309
02:31:58.84 --> 02:32:05.64
take over. Air power can't live up to its billing out here. Somebody not so much the aviators as

2310
02:32:05.64 --> 02:32:11.000
the aircraft manufacturers has sold the American people a bill of goods as to what air power can do.

2311
02:32:11.80 --> 02:32:17.88
From what I've seen one bomb will hit a section of railroad track and 100 bombs will missed

2312
02:32:17.88 --> 02:32:24.20
some of them by miles. The enemy puts coolies on the track with picks and shovels and in

2313
02:32:24.20 --> 02:32:34.04
24 hours they're rolling again. The answer is infantry. Our officer corps has had far too much

2314
02:32:34.04 --> 02:32:42.12
schooling and far too little combat experience. They can't learn war like that. Push button

2315
02:32:42.12 --> 02:32:51.72
war is as far off as in the days of Julius Caesar. The rifle hand grenade and bandat are still

2316
02:32:51.72 --> 02:32:57.96
the most important weapons. We are going to lose the next war if we don't get back to them. Why

2317
02:32:57.96 --> 02:33:03.48
half our infantry out there is still armed with carbines against the enemy with their fine Russian

2318
02:33:03.48 --> 02:33:10.12
rifles. He then turned on the training of Marines which could be which he would soon be conducting

2319
02:33:10.12 --> 02:33:15.56
at Camp Pendleton. We've got to get him tougher to survive for all these girls out of camp. Get

2320
02:33:15.56 --> 02:33:21.32
rid of the ice cream and candy. Get some pride in them. That's what we need most of all. Pride.

2321
02:33:22.76 --> 02:33:27.88
A reporter piped up. What do you think of the protest of the women's Christian temperance union

2322
02:33:27.88 --> 02:33:34.36
over sending free beer to the troops? It's news to me, Polar said, but if a few cans of beer

2323
02:33:34.36 --> 02:33:39.88
or snort of whiskey will make the men fight better, it might not be a bad idea. At least it's

2324
02:33:39.88 --> 02:33:46.92
better than ice cream and all this soft training. There's too much damn recreation and military training.

2325
02:33:46.92 --> 02:33:54.52
We should have only one purpose to fight and win. They're not being taught that now.

2326
02:33:57.24 --> 02:34:03.40
So, he's an outspoken guy. He was astonished the next day to see the following headlines.

2327
02:34:03.40 --> 02:34:10.68
Major general wants beer and whiskey for the troops. Ice cream, G.I.s lambasted by Polar,

2328
02:34:10.68 --> 02:34:20.04
Marine General Blast the Air Force. The fear reached across the nation. There was actually protests

2329
02:34:20.04 --> 02:34:26.44
against general Polar. Here's, there's, they've actually put one of these letters in the book.

2330
02:34:26.44 --> 02:34:33.16
We hear by petition to the, to the government or to the Pentagon. We hear by petition to

2331
02:34:33.16 --> 02:34:38.20
you to use every ounce of influence that you possess to keep Brigadier general polar from

2332
02:34:38.20 --> 02:34:43.24
inaugurating his beer and whiskey campaign in US military training camps.

2333
02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.52
But the panic did die down and he got to the business of training Marines.

2334
02:34:55.40 --> 02:35:01.88
And in August of 1953, Polar took examinations from major general that's two star,

2335
02:35:01.88 --> 02:35:07.72
the board which chose the new group of officers of rank approved him unanimously.

2336
02:35:07.72 --> 02:35:12.84
In July of 1954, he was sent to Camp Ligion to lead second division. His first major

2337
02:35:13.40 --> 02:35:15.000
peacetime troop command.

2338
02:35:21.16 --> 02:35:24.04
There was a little, an incident, hellf issue.

2339
02:35:24.92 --> 02:35:29.80
And one of the guys called up for general polar his wife and said brace yourself. We've taken

2340
02:35:29.80 --> 02:35:33.40
Lewis to the hospital. They can't say what's wrong. He looks pretty sick.

2341
02:35:35.72 --> 02:35:47.40
And he basically, he gets pretty sick. He kind of recovers from it. But the, like I said,

2342
02:35:47.40 --> 02:35:52.28
this guy made enemies. So here we go back to the book and this is Polar talking. I could see

2343
02:35:52.28 --> 02:35:58.68
then what the game was. They were going to retire me despite all, all the doctors had said

2344
02:35:58.68 --> 02:36:04.04
back at Ligion. They pulled me up to Washington to get rid of me. I didn't mind retiring all that

2345
02:36:04.04 --> 02:36:09.88
much, but the way they did it made me sore. I had all the service and honors. I needed or wanted.

2346
02:36:09.88 --> 02:36:15.40
I'd come all the way from private to major general. But I was boiling mad about this thing. I saw

2347
02:36:15.40 --> 02:36:20.36
lots of officers around Washington and poor condition than I was, but that wasn't going to matter.

2348
02:36:21.48 --> 02:36:26.28
He remained in the hospital in the thested for about two weeks. After many consultations,

2349
02:36:26.28 --> 02:36:33.40
the doctors found him unfit for duty. He wrote his wife, daily from his room on the 16th floor.

2350
02:36:33.40 --> 02:36:39.72
Please do not worry. We must take things as they come in life. There doesn't seem much we can do

2351
02:36:39.72 --> 02:36:46.28
to change events. So, yeah, just to tell that story a little bit more, he had like a,

2352
02:36:46.28 --> 02:36:49.32
some got to health this. It wasn't, I don't know what it was and they didn't really seem to know

2353
02:36:49.32 --> 02:36:53.56
what it was. But then he kind of recovered from it and he was back in his job and then they pulled

2354
02:36:53.56 --> 02:36:59.40
him up to Bethesda and to give him a bunch of screenings and tests and see if he was fit for duty

2355
02:36:59.40 --> 02:37:05.88
and they found that he was unfit for duty. So, that's it. That's how it ended. That's how it's

2356
02:37:05.88 --> 02:37:10.12
career ended. A day or so before he went out, there was a party in the non-commissioned officers

2357
02:37:10.12 --> 02:37:15.000
club on base. Polar had declined and offered from the officers club, but he could not turn down

2358
02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:21.64
the enlisted men. It began as an intimate party, but when Polar arrived, he found a crowd of more

2359
02:37:21.64 --> 02:37:27.96
than 5,000 who'd come to say goodbye. 20 pigs were barbecued and there was feasting and drinking

2360
02:37:27.96 --> 02:37:34.60
until late in the night. The general made one of his shirt, Burst talks when they shouted for him

2361
02:37:36.20 --> 02:37:44.28
and Sergeant Orville Jones remembered it. He said, only men, I'd rather be toting a rifle in a rear

2362
02:37:44.28 --> 02:37:51.16
rank than going out now as lieutenant general. Now if you're a Marine, you're all Marine. You'll put

2363
02:37:51.16 --> 02:37:59.08
the corps above your family, your country, even God and all else in some cases. You stick to your

2364
02:37:59.08 --> 02:38:10.68
corps. God bless you. Polar had broken tradition to the last. It was unwritten regulation that the

2365
02:38:10.68 --> 02:38:15.24
senior Marine officer on the post would pin Polar's third star on his shoulder as he retired,

2366
02:38:16.20 --> 02:38:21.80
but Polar had called for Bob Norris the senior non-commissioned officer and the oldest man

2367
02:38:21.80 --> 02:38:29.48
available who had served with him. The reporter who followed him got a formal statement. In

2368
02:38:29.48 --> 02:38:34.76
having Sergeant Major Norris attached my third star at my retirement, I wanted to show my great

2369
02:38:34.76 --> 02:38:41.32
admiration and appreciation to the enlisted men and junior officers of the Marine Corps. I fully

2370
02:38:41.32 --> 02:38:46.68
realize that without the help of the enlisted men, I'd never have risen from private to lieutenant general.

2371
02:38:47.88 --> 02:38:53.72
I've commanded everything from a squad to a division and without the help of men and junior officers,

2372
02:38:53.72 --> 02:38:58.28
these units would never have gone forward and achieved their objective regardless of almost certain

2373
02:38:58.28 --> 02:39:06.52
death. My only regret is that things now are, I will not be present for the next war.

2374
02:39:07.80 --> 02:39:12.84
I also want to express my regret at the deaths of many hundreds of Marines and the crippling and

2375
02:39:12.84 --> 02:39:21.40
maiming of other hundreds who followed me blindly into battle. Again, I would like to thank all

2376
02:39:21.40 --> 02:39:31.40
Marines for their feelings toward me. Louis, Polar went home to Virginia. It was just 37 years,

2377
02:39:31.40 --> 02:39:36.20
four months and two days since he had boarded the train in South Carolina. First South Carolina

2378
02:39:36.20 --> 02:39:45.72
to exchange the uniform of a VMI cadet for that of a Marine Corps boot. But his career with the

2379
02:39:45.72 --> 02:39:55.40
Marines wasn't quite over. Back to the book on a dimly lit night of April 8, 1956,

2380
02:39:55.40 --> 02:40:00.20
a platoon of marine recruits at Paris Island South Carolina was marched into a title arm of

2381
02:40:00.20 --> 02:40:06.76
broad river by 31-year-old veteran drill instructor staff sergeant Matthew C. McIllum.

2382
02:40:06.76 --> 02:40:15.96
Six recruits drowned. The common don, General Randolph, McCall, paid immediately,

2383
02:40:15.96 --> 02:40:20.60
relieved the commanding officer of the recruit depot and told Congress that McIllum

2384
02:40:20.60 --> 02:40:25.80
would be punished to the full extent allowed by our uniform code of military justice.

2385
02:40:25.80 --> 02:40:31.56
There was a nationwide outcry from the press, pulpit and scores of civic organizations.

2386
02:40:31.56 --> 02:40:37.72
A court inquiredly, inquiry descended upon Paris Island. McIllum became a national

2387
02:40:37.72 --> 02:40:45.56
cause to celebrate a sailed by prohibitionists as a brutal drunkard, as a symbol of military

2388
02:40:45.56 --> 02:40:53.000
tyranny which must be destroyed, as a racist, bigot near duet. There were cries for harsh punishment,

2389
02:40:53.000 --> 02:41:04.20
even execution. Now, he ends up going to trial and for this trial, the defense brings in

2390
02:41:04.84 --> 02:41:13.16
Chess DiPolar, who we know believes in hard training. And here we go. This is a court scene.

2391
02:41:14.36 --> 02:41:19.40
Burman, who's the lawyer, used the general like a master's showman, the defense desires to call

2392
02:41:19.40 --> 02:41:27.000
to the stand of Lieutenant General Polar. Seviers, one of the lawyers, sir, how do you know the

2393
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.96
accused? Polar, I don't know him except by his pictures and the newspapers and what I've

2394
02:41:31.96 --> 02:41:36.52
read about him. Then Burman took over and questioned the general about his careers in Marine.

2395
02:41:36.52 --> 02:41:41.24
Burman, how long were you in Korea? Polar, about nine months.

2396
02:41:43.16 --> 02:41:48.84
Burman, were you in combat? Yeah, were you decorated? Yeah, without going into any other,

2397
02:41:48.84 --> 02:41:53.80
any of your other decorations, isn't it true that you've received five Navy crosses? Correct.

2398
02:41:55.72 --> 02:42:01.56
Burman asked his opinion of the Marine Corps's mission. The definition of military training is

2399
02:42:01.56 --> 02:42:07.88
success in battle. In my opinion, that is the only objective of military training. It wouldn't

2400
02:42:07.88 --> 02:42:12.44
make any sense to have a military organization on the backs of the American taxpayers with any

2401
02:42:12.44 --> 02:42:19.64
other definition. I believe that ever since I was better Marine. What is the most important element

2402
02:42:19.64 --> 02:42:25.48
of that training? I'll quote Napoleon. He stated that the most important thing in military training

2403
02:42:25.48 --> 02:42:33.56
is discipline. Without discipline and army becomes a mob. Now then, in that context,

2404
02:42:33.56 --> 02:42:37.96
can you tell us whether you have an opinion based on your experience as to whether or not the training

2405
02:42:37.96 --> 02:42:43.80
in discipline is for all situations confined to lesson plan or syllabi or training regulations?

2406
02:42:44.76 --> 02:42:51.08
No. The training of a basic Marine is conducted almost entirely outside in the field on the

2407
02:42:51.08 --> 02:42:56.60
drill ground, on the rifle range. That kind of work. The Marine gets an idea of how the Marine

2408
02:42:56.60 --> 02:43:00.92
Corps's run during this training, but his training is outside work.

2409
02:43:00.92 --> 02:43:08.44
Can you tell us general of the things you learned here as a recruit? Well, the main thing

2410
02:43:08.44 --> 02:43:12.04
that I've remembered all my life is the definition of a spree decor.

2411
02:43:13.32 --> 02:43:17.64
Now my definition, the definition I was taught that I've always believed in,

2412
02:43:17.64 --> 02:43:23.08
is that a spree decor means love for one's military legion. In my case, the United States Marine

2413
02:43:23.08 --> 02:43:32.60
Corps. I also learned that this loyalty to one's corps travels both ways up and down.

2414
02:43:33.16 --> 02:43:44.60
And he continued through this trial. And that night, he went to the enlisted man's club

2415
02:43:45.48 --> 02:43:52.04
and big crowd, of course, was there. And they start shouting and yelling for him to speak and

2416
02:43:52.04 --> 02:43:56.92
find the Eastans up and says, I've talked enough for today. This will be my last request. Do your

2417
02:43:56.92 --> 02:44:03.000
duty and the Marine Corps will be as great as it has always been for another thousand years.

2418
02:44:04.76 --> 02:44:15.88
The applause was deafening. And he went back to his hometown of Saludah and he was not forgotten

2419
02:44:15.88 --> 02:44:25.56
there. There he was getting interviewed by a graduate student who was trying to learn about psychology

2420
02:44:25.56 --> 02:44:30.52
in the general said, I've never studied psychology. I had only one year of college and always thought

2421
02:44:30.52 --> 02:44:37.24
I would go back but enlisted instead. I think the Marine Corps is the best place to learn the art of war.

2422
02:44:40.04 --> 02:44:45.32
And then again, this reflects back people now say that America is getting soft and they

2423
02:44:45.32 --> 02:44:52.04
are youthful. So they're saying the same thing, everything's going bad and they have a panel of

2424
02:44:52.04 --> 02:45:00.36
experts to deal with the decline of the nation. And it's rising tide of juvenile delinquency.

2425
02:45:01.32 --> 02:45:05.24
The consensus, the consensus was that the country was going to hell in a hand bucket.

2426
02:45:06.52 --> 02:45:13.08
General Polar, while this big meeting is going on, General Polar stood and intended, and his

2427
02:45:13.08 --> 02:45:18.60
intended mildness of tone as usual came forth as a brazen war. I want you people to know

2428
02:45:18.60 --> 02:45:22.84
something, as long as we can get some decent leadership in our country, are youth to today

2429
02:45:22.84 --> 02:45:28.44
will be better men than their fathers or grandfathers. I saw enough in Korea to make sure of that.

2430
02:45:28.44 --> 02:45:32.76
Are four fathers at Valley Forge have been mentioned here tonight as they often are.

2431
02:45:33.48 --> 02:45:37.48
Well, I can tell you that Valley Forge was something like a picnic compared to what your

2432
02:45:37.48 --> 02:45:41.88
younger Americans went through at the chosen reservoir and they came out of it fine.

2433
02:45:41.88 --> 02:45:49.08
It was never anything like 25 below zero at Valley Forge either. I admit we don't seem to have

2434
02:45:49.08 --> 02:45:52.36
the proper leadership at the top, but there's nothing wrong with the kids today.

2435
02:45:53.80 --> 02:45:58.92
My wife and I follow the ideas, my mother used on her kids, making them study each night

2436
02:45:58.92 --> 02:46:04.36
after this after supper, and when they report that they have mastered their lessons,

2437
02:46:04.36 --> 02:46:10.92
quizzing them, our children don't need to be coddled and they shouldn't be condemned. A

2438
02:46:10.92 --> 02:46:16.76
above all for heaven's sake, let your sons alone and let them grow up to be men.

2439
02:46:21.48 --> 02:46:26.84
It's interesting that I would say that still applies in very many ways.

2440
02:46:26.84 --> 02:46:38.28
He also had people visiting him all the time and asking him questions and he was again.

2441
02:46:38.28 --> 02:46:45.000
He remained a outspoken guy. I'm afraid we haven't recognized the most important lesson from

2442
02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:51.16
Korea. The communists have developed a totally new kind of warfare, a warfare of whole peoples.

2443
02:46:51.96 --> 02:46:56.28
And under that no modern nation can be conquered. We saw something like that in China when

2444
02:46:56.28 --> 02:47:02.44
Japan was nibbling away at the mainland. The Japanese controlled only a square yard where a soldier stood

2445
02:47:02.44 --> 02:47:08.92
and nothing beyond that. In Korea, the reds improved on that. This is total warfare.

2446
02:47:08.92 --> 02:47:13.08
Yet small and scope and its design to neutralize our big nuclear weapons.

2447
02:47:14.04 --> 02:47:19.000
Look at Vietnam, the French outnumbered the communists 2-1, yet they were massacred.

2448
02:47:19.72 --> 02:47:24.76
If we don't design some way to meet this, they'll whip us in the end. Don't forget that regular

2449
02:47:24.76 --> 02:47:31.000
armies have never fared well in irregular warfare. That lesson was old when Rome fell.

2450
02:47:32.04 --> 02:47:36.04
It's amazing that he's saying this. It's just a man that the Frenchman would be,

2451
02:47:36.04 --> 02:47:41.16
we don't think we were even in Vietnam yet. In fact, we weren't Vietnam yet when he's making these statements.

2452
02:47:43.32 --> 02:47:44.60
We didn't pay attention to it.

2453
02:47:44.60 --> 02:47:57.96
Finally, he goes to a, and there was some kind of a rift between him and the first Marine Division

2454
02:47:57.96 --> 02:48:05.16
Association and they sorted out that rift and he went to a big reunion of the Marine Corps,

2455
02:48:05.72 --> 02:48:10.60
the first Marine Division Association. Back to the book, General Smith blanked against the spotlight

2456
02:48:10.60 --> 02:48:14.68
and turned to the blackness at the far end of the table. I now give you

2457
02:48:15.96 --> 02:48:22.60
Chestee and the roar, the roar was so loud at drowned out the speakers' voice and shook the walls.

2458
02:48:22.60 --> 02:48:27.96
The spotlight swung to the last place at the table to reveal polar and a linen suit waving his hand

2459
02:48:27.96 --> 02:48:34.52
and flashing his broad crooked grin. As the clamor increased, he marched to the microphone and started

2460
02:48:35.08 --> 02:48:39.88
in a bobbing circle of light. General Smith shouted to the tempest of the sound. I see you all

2461
02:48:39.88 --> 02:48:46.28
know Chestee Polar. Men in the crowd danced among the tables, world each other about and pounded

2462
02:48:46.28 --> 02:48:52.20
their neighbors on the backs, some climbed on their chairs, shouting wordlessly, tears streaming

2463
02:48:52.20 --> 02:48:59.16
on their cheeks. Others hammered the table with Kotlery or embraced women who were staring

2464
02:48:59.16 --> 02:49:09.000
in cregiously at Polar. The men broke into chance, we want Chestee, we want Polar. They called for a

2465
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:16.44
speech, but it was almost five minutes before the howling ceased. Polar faced them with a rise smile

2466
02:49:16.44 --> 02:49:25.16
that looked as if it had been run from his face by force. When quiet returned, he grasped the microphone

2467
02:49:25.16 --> 02:49:33.08
and called in an astonishingly penetrating voice. Marines! Pandemonium broke out once more as if he

2468
02:49:33.08 --> 02:49:38.52
had shouted some secret watch word whose implications were known only to these men. Half the crowd

2469
02:49:38.52 --> 02:49:46.92
was still on its feet a moment later when Polar could be heard again. If you believe the newspapers

2470
02:49:46.92 --> 02:49:53.16
and radio is in television, our country is in a hell of a shape. I don't believe it.

2471
02:49:53.16 --> 02:50:03.56
So long as we've got the first Marine Division, we'll be okay. The crowd shouted him in

2472
02:50:03.56 --> 02:50:12.76
silence again. He was tired when he got home to Saluda and that evening, Virginia Polar

2473
02:50:12.76 --> 02:50:21.40
found him pensive and destructive. Distracted. They sat on the screened porch looking out

2474
02:50:21.40 --> 02:50:29.80
into the Virginia dusk lit by fireflies. Lewis, is there anything you'd wish for?

2475
02:50:29.80 --> 02:50:39.40
Now that it's all over? Well, he said, I'd like to do it all over again. The whole thing.

2476
02:50:39.40 --> 02:50:56.12
She's side. More than that. More than anything. I'd like to see the face once again

2477
02:50:56.12 --> 02:51:20.04
of every Marine I've ever served with. And that is where this book ends. But that is not where

2478
02:51:20.04 --> 02:51:28.28
this story ends. Because as I mentioned, and as the book mentioned,

2479
02:51:29.88 --> 02:51:39.000
Jestie Polar had a son. And his son also became a Marine Corps officer, but his son

2480
02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:50.28
experienced in the Marine Corps in combat. And in life was very different from his fathers.

2481
02:51:50.28 --> 02:51:59.88
And I will tell that story in the next episode number 122, which is available now, so you can

2482
02:51:59.88 --> 02:52:13.80
listen to it immediately. Because these stories are linked. And so we are linking them in this series

2483
02:52:13.80 --> 02:52:23.32
of podcasts. And in the meantime, before you listen to that echo, if somebody wants to support

2484
02:52:23.32 --> 02:52:30.68
this podcast, can you briefly tell us how we can do it? Yes. Okay, briefly. Talk about the

2485
02:52:30.68 --> 02:52:35.64
story. Jocquistore. That is where you can get discipline equals freedom. Shirts.

2486
02:52:37.40 --> 02:52:45.000
Hats. Some rash guards on their hoodies. And Benes are on the way. Promise.

2487
02:52:45.72 --> 02:52:50.76
If not already. Just check on that. Jocquistore.com. There's a lot of good stuff on there for women.

2488
02:52:50.76 --> 02:52:58.12
And also kid stuff where you kid stuff. Also, when you get the book,

2489
02:53:00.20 --> 02:53:05.24
Marine Life of Chester Polar, I'm going to listen on the website in the book section. So in the

2490
02:53:05.24 --> 02:53:09.64
top, you click there. It says a books from episodes. And I'll have them all listed by episode.

2491
02:53:10.92 --> 02:53:15.000
Click through there. Good way to support. Take it Amazon. And you get your book and get whatever

2492
02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:23.40
else you're shopping for. Also, go to originmain.com. This is where you can get your gear. If you're

2493
02:53:23.40 --> 02:53:29.32
doing Jiu-Jitsu, when you do Jiu-Jitsu, this is where you can get your gear. All made in America.

2494
02:53:29.32 --> 02:53:37.24
There's also rash guards on there. And there's some hoodies and sweatpants and stuff on there.

2495
02:53:37.24 --> 02:53:42.12
Very comfortable. I went over that before. But nonetheless, go there.

2496
02:53:42.12 --> 02:53:50.44
Originmain.com. Also, originmain.com. Still, you can get Jocquistoplements. We have

2497
02:53:51.48 --> 02:53:55.80
milk. That's the new one. Is that available yet? Yes. Boom. There you go.

2498
02:53:55.80 --> 02:54:03.72
Malt protein powder. Mint chocolate chip. That's the good one. Taste good too. What else tastes good is

2499
02:54:03.72 --> 02:54:12.28
Jocquistoplement, which is a Nutropic pre-mission supplement. Good little bit of caffeine in there

2500
02:54:12.28 --> 02:54:18.60
not too much. A little bit. But for, you know, it has the physical supplementation benefits and

2501
02:54:18.60 --> 02:54:24.84
the cognitive supplemental benefits. So, get down called discipline. Also, joint warfare and

2502
02:54:24.84 --> 02:54:30.44
krill oil. Jocquistoplement. These supplements are for your joints. Don't neglect your joints.

2503
02:54:30.44 --> 02:54:37.80
It's a big deal. You can be able to lift 500 pounds. But if your elbows are jacked up,

2504
02:54:37.80 --> 02:54:41.80
you're not going to be able to lift up 500 pounds. Maybe you get a warm-up of lunch. But I don't know.

2505
02:54:41.80 --> 02:54:45.96
It'll mess you up. If you joints mess up, it's a big deal. Anyway, take care of your joints.

2506
02:54:45.96 --> 02:54:51.80
Super krill and joint warfare. All made in America, by the way. Everything in originmain.

want to get it. Also, subscribe to the podcast. If you haven't already on iTunes,

2517
02:55:54.68 --> 02:56:04.68
Stitcher, Google Play, Spotify, wherever they have podcasts, subscribe. Good way to support. Also,

2518
02:56:04.68 --> 02:56:12.44
YouTube. Video version of this podcast also excerpts. Little lessons kind of just taken from each

2519
02:56:12.44 --> 02:56:18.52
episode and enhanced excerpts. If you're really into feeling the message, just

2520
02:56:18.52 --> 02:56:24.60
doctor, I'm almost a music or something like that. Also, psychological warfare. If you

2521
02:56:24.60 --> 02:56:30.84
know what that is, it's an album with tracks. Jockelte telling you, pragmatic advice how to get through

2522
02:56:31.72 --> 02:56:36.12
moments of weakness in your campaign against weakness. Like workouts. Like if you're

2523
02:56:36.12 --> 02:56:41.24
want to skip the workout or you want to slip on the diet just a little bit, just refer to one of

2524
02:56:41.24 --> 02:56:45.16
the tracks on there. Jockelte tell you, you know, hold the line as they say.

2525
02:56:45.16 --> 02:56:53.64
Check and you know, speaking of subscribe and subscribing. We have a new podcast out and it's

2526
02:56:53.64 --> 02:56:59.88
actually separate from this podcast. The new podcast is called the Warrior Kid podcast,

2527
02:57:00.52 --> 02:57:05.80
Ask Uncle Jake. Like I said, it's a separate channel. So you have to subscribe to it separately.

2528
02:57:05.80 --> 02:57:11.96
I did that because as you know from listening to this podcast, there's some podcasts that are

2529
02:57:11.96 --> 02:57:19.16
for very mature audiences and you wouldn't want to have your kid listening to that, you know,

2530
02:57:19.16 --> 02:57:26.12
a kid podcast and all of a sudden a very violent podcast comes on. So we separated them,

2531
02:57:26.12 --> 02:57:34.36
the Warrior Kid podcast questions for Uncle Jake and I think Uncle Jake has lessons for everyone.

2532
02:57:34.36 --> 02:57:40.36
We're going to listen to each other. Yeah. You know, I think teachers and parents and big-tem would

2533
02:57:40.36 --> 02:57:45.000
want to listen to that as well. Yeah. Got some great feedback so far on it. So that's called the Warrior

2534
02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:49.72
Kid podcast. And on top of that, there's a new Warrior Kid book. It's called Mark's Mission.

2535
02:57:50.44 --> 02:57:57.24
If you actually want it, you should order it now through whatever channel you want to order it

2536
02:57:57.24 --> 02:58:04.04
from. Go to your local bookstore, go to Amazon, go to Barnes and Noble order it. So that you

2537
02:58:04.04 --> 02:58:09.08
have it when it comes out so that the publisher knows how many to make. Because otherwise the publisher

2538
02:58:09.08 --> 02:58:12.04
thinks, oh, well, we won't make that many of them because there's not that many people that, you know,

2539
02:58:12.04 --> 02:58:17.48
we're going to buy this in the wrong because you all are going to buy this. So if they don't know that,

2540
02:58:17.48 --> 02:58:22.28
they don't make enough. It takes too long to get it once it comes out. So order it now.

2541
02:58:23.56 --> 02:58:30.36
Other books you can order extreme ownership, combat leadership for business and life.

2542
02:58:30.36 --> 02:58:34.44
Discipline equals freedom field manual. It's about getting after it. And actually,

2543
02:58:34.44 --> 02:58:39.80
late afternoon, I have a new book coming out, a follow up to extreme ownership. It's called the

2544
02:58:39.80 --> 02:58:45.80
dichotomy of leadership. It is available for preorder right now. Same thing order it now. So that

2545
02:58:45.80 --> 02:58:49.08
you get your copy when it comes out. Otherwise, you'll be waiting.

2546
02:58:50.92 --> 02:58:54.20
I have a leadership and management consulting company. It's called Ashilon Front. If you

2547
02:58:54.20 --> 02:58:59.24
want information about that, go to Ashilonfront.com. We have the Master, which is a leadership

2548
02:58:59.24 --> 02:59:06.04
conference coming up. If you want to come to it, go to extreme ownership.com. And also, if you

2549
02:59:06.04 --> 02:59:12.36
want to attend the role call, which is for military law enforcement firefighters, paramedics,

2550
02:59:12.36 --> 02:59:18.68
other first responders. If you want to do that, you can also sign up for the role call at extremotorship.com.

2551
02:59:19.72 --> 02:59:27.64
And with that, as I just mentioned, these podcasts, these three podcasts that we're doing right now,

2552
02:59:27.64 --> 02:59:37.56
are all linked. It's one big story with a thread running through it. And we are releasing them all at the

2553
02:59:37.56 --> 02:59:46.84
same time. So the next one will be 122 and 123. Go ahead and go listen to them right now.

2554
02:59:46.84 --> 02:59:57.24
Until then, this is echo and jockel out.
