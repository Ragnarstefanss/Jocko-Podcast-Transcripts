00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockelpodcast number 334 with echo Charles and me, Jockelwillink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We were sitting by a fixed section of reprod, a logging term for young timber. When I heard the high pitched bugle of a male elk.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The 15-foot tall trees shifted like the parting of the seas and a massive bull stepped out onto the logging road.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I was leaning on my knees, trying to look invisible as the black horned six by seven bull bore holes through me with his eyes.

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
He was in bull range and when I decided that I should try to kill him, the thing I'd been practicing to do for months,

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I realized that it felt like my arms were asleep and my heart was beating out of my chest.

7
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I don't know if I can even pull this bull back, the bull stood there only 40 yards away from me.

8
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There was no question I should be able to kill him. I'd shot thousands of arrows at this distance all summer.

9
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I pulled back the bowstring and released.

10
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The arrow missed the bull. Shop behind his butt. That meant I was about seven feet off my mark, which was ridiculous.

11
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This was what I'd called, Shitting the Bed. My first bowshot of my life at an animal couldn't have been much worse.

12
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I didn't get another opportunity that day, but something was ignited inside me.

13
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'd never had any real ambitions or goals for myself, but something changed.

14
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now all I knew was I wanted to kill a bull. So right after that first day hunting debacle, I became obsessed and hunted for the next 18 days straight, determined to succeed.

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That's right, 18 days straight.

16
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Finally on September 13th, 1989, I killed my first bull.

17
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The first animal that ever died from one of my arrows was a small, young, spike bull.

18
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Granite, it wasn't anything like the giant six by seven. I blew it on, but it didn't matter.

19
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It was my first bow kill and my first bull elk.

20
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Truth is, I didn't deserve a big bull yet. I hadn't paid my bow hunting dues.

21
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And size aside, I didn't know many guys who had even killed a bull with their bow.

22
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So my spike bull accomplishment still felt special.

23
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It was almost a three week grind, but it was worth it.

24
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Some people live their whole lives and never finding their true passion.

25
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I was 20 years old when I first tasted bow hunting success and that marked the time I discovered my purpose.

26
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Suddenly, I had something in my life to focus my energy on.

27
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I quit college and quit about everything else just to be able to bow hump more.

28
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'll never forget where this journey began and how long it's taken to hammer away at a dream.

29
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We all have to start somewhere.

30
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Nobody is born great at bow hunting.

31
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The average success rate on hunting a bull elk with a bow is about 10%.

32
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So that's one kill every 10 years or one guy out of ten who is going to have success.

33
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That's never going to be good enough for me. Never was, never will be average sucks.

34
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Nowadays, I earn success on virtually every hunt in every state every year.

35
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So I expect to be 100% when the average is 10%.

36
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
That said, I didn't wake up one morning, great at bow hunting.

37
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I've worked for more than 30 years to get where I am today.

38
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It's not talent. It's drive.

39
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's not raw ability.

40
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It's endurance.

41
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Hunting is my passion and being successful at it is what fuels me every day to get better than the day before.

42
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And that right there is an excerpt from a book which is called Endur,

43
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
how to work hard outlast and keep hammering.

44
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And if you haven't figured it out yet, this is a book written by an individual named Cameron Haynes.

45
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Cameron Haynes is one of the most highly respected and successful bow hunters in the world.

46
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
In order to get there in order to get to that level of expertise and ability,

47
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
he has lived a relentless life of utmost discipline

48
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and unmitigated focus.

49
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And I guess since he's got this book, he's written some other books that he's an author

50
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and I guess since he trains hard, he's an endurance athlete and I know that he represents brands

51
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and I know that he's founded and runs businesses

52
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
but first and foremost, he's a bow hunter, one of the best in the world.

53
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And we are lucky enough to have him here with us tonight to share some of his experiences

54
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and some of his lessons learned along the way and how they apply not only to bow hunting, but to life.

55
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Cam, thanks for joining us, man.

56
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It's an honor to be here. Thank you guys.

57
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
That's a...

58
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That first one, huh? That first shot was a...

59
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The first shot you took was a miss.

60
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Do you know what you did wrong?

61
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Yeah, I mean, I just was wrapped up in the moment, adrenaline was going crazy.

62
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
How it gets course in three or veins, it's kind of a new experience

63
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and so intense with that bow coming in and the reprod spreading like I said,

64
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I could see the tree shaking as it came down, I'm just like,

65
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
holy shit, what is going on? And then now, and I've been watching the bull because I was up there

66
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the night before on Friday night, Saturday morning that season opened.

67
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So I've been watching from about, I don't know, my own half a liter of myel.

68
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So I knew the bull and I knew what the focus was and it was a big bull and I knew all that from afar,

69
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
but once he gets in the showtime,

70
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I think I just hammered that trigger of my release and probably peaked,

71
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and I shot and just missed.

72
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It was brutal, it's rough.

73
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Well, we'll get to some of the more of those experiences and I'm sure you'll...

74
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I'm sure I'll share some of my very limited experiences, but definitely can get kind of crazy out there.

75
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
That's why we love it that it can city.

76
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Yeah, no, yeah, what we'll get to those kind of things is,

77
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I think the term that you use with me is it can be heartbreaking.

78
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And I was kind of surprised, the first time I went hunting, I thought that no one told me that it was like a 10% success.

79
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I kind of thought like, hey, you just go out there and when you're used to shooting with a rifle,

80
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
like, hey, you shoot it something, first of all you can shoot a lot further away.

81
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Second of all, when you shoot it, it's easier to hit it where you want to hit it,

82
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and it has so much force and a bullet that it's going to cause some massive damage and, you know, shit dies.

83
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Yeah, it's not so easy with a bow and arrow.

84
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
No, more variables, and then it kills by him, right?

85
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So, hold a different thing, shock, muscle bone, get broke apart with the gun, with the archery, it's him, right?

86
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So it's where you hit that animal.

87
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Well, let's, let's, before we jump into where you're at now, let's go back a little bit to the beginning and where you came from and where you grew up.

88
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Going to the book, this book,

89
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000
uh, freaking awesome, it order it, order it right now. We're going to cover a little bit about it today. So many stories in there. So much detail.

90
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It's just an awesome read.

91
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So let's go to the book a little bit and talk about where you came from.

92
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You say here, the biggest legend around Eugene, or Oregon, when I was a kid, I'll wait, what's it, what's the stress on Oregon?

93
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
How are you supposed to say it or again? How do, how do, how are you supposed to not say it or a gun?

94
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
There you go. I'm, I'm David close to that one.

95
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Or again, all right, the biggest legend around Eugene, Oregon, when I was a kid, was long distance Olympic runner, Steve Prefontein.

96
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But for me, it was my dad.

97
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Bob Haynes was Superman in my eyes.

98
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
In a town known as Tracktown, USA, my dad excelled at the sport.

99
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
He earned a full ride scholarship at the University of Oregon in gymnastics and after flunking out there,

100
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
earned a full ride at Oregon State for Track, where they wanted him to pull, pull, pull and hide jump.

101
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
That's, that's a freaking athlete.

102
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
If you're gymnastics and track, yeah, he was, he was a beast.

103
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And he just grew up. That's always did track.

104
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You know, Junior Nationals, I had this scrapbook. So I'd like always just look at a scrapbook and headlines and all these things and just a,

105
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
just a, great, great athlete.

106
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Beast.

107
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
You say, he and my mom fast forward a little bit. He and my mom, Linda Brown, met at South Eugene.

108
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I never forgot something she told me when I was five years old.

109
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Your dad legs are so muscular. There's hard as this wood table.

110
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
She said, she pointed out our, oh, coffee table.

111
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Little comments like that made him seem larger than life.

112
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We covered a book on this podcast. It's called Wooden Leg.

113
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And it was about, it was about an Indian.

114
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And his name was Wooden Leg and the reason they called him that was because he could just like go and just keep going.

115
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Yeah.

116
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So got them genetics.

117
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Yeah, I guess so.

118
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Yeah.

119
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Going a little bit more forward again on May 30th, 1975, Steve Prefontane died in an automobile accident earlier that evening.

120
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Steven won a 5,000 meter run at University of Oregon's Hayward Field. He was only 24 years old.

121
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The place where he crashed on the winding narrow skyline Boulevard is now known as pre-es Rock.

122
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Four years earlier, another car accident happened only 10 minutes from pre-es Rock.

123
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Nobody got killed, but it might have helped tear a family apart.

124
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
It's one of my earliest memories of my parents when they were still married.

125
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
In fact, it's one of my only memories. I was four years old and I woke up hearing my mother yelling.

126
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I went to find her standing by the door, heading into the garage, talking loudly and frantically to my dad.

127
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
When I stepped to her side and followed her eyes, I noticed the side of my dad's car was damaged as if he had just hit another vehicle.

128
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I didn't know this at the time, but my dad was now Catholic.

129
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Thankfully, Bob Haynes was able to walk away from this accident, not long after that, my parents divorced.

130
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
That's what was going on when you were...

131
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
That's like your earliest memories are really, you say, your only memories of your parents being married.

132
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Then they were divorced, not to go back and forth, but them together.

133
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
That's about it.

134
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
One other night, my dad, he once college was over, he'd play softball.

135
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
He came home one night and I remember he was a slid in the base and he had a bunch of blood running down his knee.

136
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I remember sitting there and watching TV and looking at that.

137
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So those two, that's about it.

138
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
That night after his softball game with blood, and then when he was drunk and hit a car.

139
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000
You go through in the book, you know, you talk about the, you know, your mom, she's...

140
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Well, I mean, she's got a kind of carry on with her life, right?

141
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I mean, she starts dating other guys.

142
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Eventually, she gets married to who ends up being your stepdad.

143
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
How old were you and that happened?

144
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I think five.

145
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And what did he do for work?

146
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
He drove roller for the paving company.

147
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
It sounds like he was a bit of a booser, too.

148
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Yeah, yep, definitely.

149
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Definitely had drinking issues and then, you know, he wasn't my dad, so I hated him.

150
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I don't think he liked me.

151
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Definitely didn't seem like it.

152
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So, yeah, it's, you know, whatever it happens.

153
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
That's just the way it seems to go, doesn't it?

154
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Sometimes with the stepdad's.

155
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Yeah, but it's a tough job for them.

156
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They're coming in.

157
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
They're, the woman better be pretty hot.

158
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
If they're going to have to deal with you.

159
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.000
That's all I know.

160
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And there's two of you.

161
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Is there two of you?

162
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So it's you and your brother, right?

164
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yeah, well, young brother.

165
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
He's a couple years younger.

166
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So yeah, it's, my mom came with some baggage.

167
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Yeah, instant, we used to say in the SEAL teams, like when a guy would meet up with some girl

168
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
or start like seriously dating a girl,

169
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and maybe even get married to a girl that had a couple of like instant family.

170
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Yeah, you know, you don't get any like a normal normal, you get married.

171
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You have like the honeymoon period or whatever.

172
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Two, three years just you and this girl, but no, you got instant family.

173
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I know.

174
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
What are you doing on Saturday?

175
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
You're freaking doing yard work and like there's no honeymoon period.

176
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I know, I know, it's rough.

177
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Roll and straight into it.

178
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Yeah.

179
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And then you got young cam who hates you.

180
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah.

181
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And you know, I have since my dad wasn't around, I just had this vision of my dad and from what I heard

182
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and the scrapbooks.

183
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And so then this guy who comes in with who the fuck are you?

184
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
What have you done?

185
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Drive roller.

186
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You know, so it's a tough hand.

187
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It's like, it's no win for sure for him.

188
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.000
You got some crazy stories in here.

189
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I had to pull this one out though.

190
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I had this, this would kind of struck me because it seems like this kind of shit happens to everyone in some way, shape, or form.

191
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You got this going on when I was in third and fourth grades.

192
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
My mom worked with and became friends with this lady at the phone company.

193
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I remember her being very pretty and nice.

194
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
They went out on weekends leaving Pete and me with the woman's teenage sons to babysit.

195
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
My step dad had a heartily and so did the husband of my mom's friend.

196
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So they would go out on road trips or maybe just out for the night while it was a long time ago.

197
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I don't remember all the details.

198
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
There are a few things I do remember that might always haunt me.

199
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The teenage brothers weren't the greatest babysitters.

200
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
They used drugs and made me and my brother fight in front of their friends.

201
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They'd yell and scream and treat it like entertainment, coaching us and how to hit each other hard.

202
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Whenever there was blood, the boys yelled louder and got even more fired up.

203
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Pete and I didn't like it, but I don't remember having a choice or maybe it was the way for us young boys to try and earn approval from the older boys.

204
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.000
The brothers watched us at our house as we had a pool table and they got and then they and their friends had something to do as they acted crazy and got drunk and high during those stressful nights.

205
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
They made me smoke pots so I couldn't tell on them.

206
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
How old were you?

207
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Third grade.

208
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Damn.

209
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We do whatever they said so I smoke pot and then they put shaving cream in my mouth as they said it mask the scent of pot.

210
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The younger brother did most of the communicating with us and said if we told on them they would tell my mom that I smoke pot too.

211
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
If I hadn't already learned that life wasn't always going to be fun and loving, I did then.

212
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:20.000
My young eyes were open to the fact that there were people in this world that you could never trust and that would hurt you for entertainment.

213
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
That's freaking crazy.

214
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And you go on to say that the one brother, one of these two brothers ended up dead of a heroin no overdose and the other one tripped out on some kind of drugs and killed one of his friends.

215
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Yeah, he took mushrooms that not long after. I mean during that whole time and thought as friend was the devil I think is what it was and ended up killing him.

216
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
It's when he's 15.

217
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Damn.

218
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So this is a rough scenario you're left now.

219
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
How often are you getting to go to your dad's?

220
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:20.000
My dad was, you know, he's having issues of his own with drink and you know he'd have girlfriends and I think you worked at a, he was a bartender at the black forest as a tavern there off a lamb at Eugene and so yeah he's.

221
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
You know he's young too.

222
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
You know, you're 20 some years old. You don't want to have to take care of some kid.

223
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So it's pretty much mostly most of the times at this point is spent with your mom.

224
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Yeah.

225
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
You go through more stuff about that. I'm going to fast forward a little bit to middle school.

226
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Middle school you're trying to try to make things happen even to middle school. You got a paper route. You're doing strawberry pick.

227
00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Yeah. You got you got you put this quote in here. You said during this period of my life with all the time to be in my own head and that's when you're out taking strawberries or you're out delivering papers.

228
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
One constant thought came to my mind.

229
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
This sucks.

230
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
That's pretty heavy for a freaking middle school kid.

231
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Yeah. I remember because at that time the local paper is every day. So I'd have to get up a four and you know Oregon, especially lamb of valley there. I mean it rains a lot, especially in the winter.

232
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Dark as shit.

233
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
For in the morning I'm out there loaded up my little canvas bag. He put papers on the front and back.

234
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
It's kind of strong over your shoulders and then I just ride my bike to the houses in deliver.

235
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I'd have to get that all loaded up at the paper box. He'd come and drop papers off like it two in the morning. I'd go out there or four and get all that and just pouring down rain and I'm just like

236
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:59.000
It sucked. I mean it was it you know I know lots of people have paper routes, but yeah, I'd given everything else. Then at that time I had moved in with my dad because I hated my stepdad so much.

237
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:14.000
So I was and I didn't miss anybody but my brother basically we'd kind of been in it together. And so I'd live with my dad my my step or I mean my brother would stay with my mom because he didn't really know my dad that well because he's so young.

238
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And and yeah, so it was like given everything else and then that's situation. Yeah, I feel like a lot.

239
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Fast forward a little bit more. You say, since my dad was some legendary track guy, I decided to attempt to follow in his footsteps.

240
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:47.000
During one particular track meet, I was excited to see my step mom candy coming watch me knowing that she was going to tell my dad how I did. He wasn't there himself, but his spirit loomed large like it always did.

241
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
It was really hard to get his attention in athletics since he was gone traveling around with junior national teams.

242
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000
You couldn't do regular shit and be celebrated. I knew I had to make my marks or I decided I would do it in the 800 meter race at that meet.

243
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
When the gun went off, I took off as if it was a 200 meter dash.

244
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I ran like Steve Prefontein going out as hard going out hard and refusing to let go of the lead for sure while a very short while I raised at the front.

245
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
But by the end of the first lap, I was dying.

246
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000
I still remember the guy who won the race Greg Suter. He was a natural track guy who won all the time. He looked like a runner tall and lean.

247
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I was the short, leg-and-kid gasping at the end of the race and finishing last.

248
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I was thankful my dad hadn't accompanied my step mom to the meet. This was my normal. I just didn't have it.

249
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
That's what I drew up with.

250
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Life has always been agrined.

251
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Coming out of the gate hard.

252
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
800 meters, I heard somebody talking about 800 meters.

253
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
There were saying, there's people that run everything from a 5K to a marathon.

254
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
That's all what's the word, sort of fun stuff that people do.

255
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
But there's no one that goes out.

256
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Hey, we're running an 800 this week because it sucks so horribly.

257
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
It's the half mile basically a sprint.

258
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
It's tough. Especially when you're not, you know, I just, it was just a kid.

259
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Middle school kid wasn't born to do it.

260
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
So is this like six seventh grade? What grade is this?

261
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I think that was probably, I'd say, seventh or eighth.

262
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Yeah.

263
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And you got your ass beat.

264
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I didn't, did you feel like, you know, I mean, this is the kind of thing.

265
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
That's a kind of thing that said kids like just often the other direction.

266
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Did you feel any of that? Did you just to keep doing track?

267
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
No, because then then my dad moved to Portland so I moved up there, which is a much bigger city than Eugene.

268
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And then I didn't even get a chance to compete with anything.

269
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Because if I wasn't good at a smaller school, I'm not getting anything.

270
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
So I remember up there, you were a small fish and a small pond.

271
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
When you got to the big pond, you were like a meno.

272
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Oh my god, it was not even. I was, I might as well.

273
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
I didn't exist as far as the school goes.

274
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I mean, it's just like nobody knew me.

275
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I never made one friend.

276
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I mean, it was, I remember it.

277
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I remember it's laughing.

278
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I know.

279
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.000
No, my asshole.

280
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Maybe a little bit.

281
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
It's, it's just, I'd be laughing too.

282
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
It's like, I remember I had zits all in my chin.

283
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You know, I'm like, God, so I did mull on.

284
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I took out my dad lived in a pretty good area.

285
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
He opened this record store in downtown Portland, like collectible records.

286
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
That's what he loved to do.

287
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And so I would be out in Beaverton, which is out of Portland.

288
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And I would go in mull yards and get get some money that way.

289
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Nobody's given me money.

290
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And yeah, I mean, my brother would come up.

291
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I remember what time he came up to visit and he didn't like going up there.

292
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
But we played one on one football.

293
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I was better than him because I was two years older.

294
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So it was like that was my, that was glory to me.

295
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.000
That was glory.

296
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Like reliving the one on one football match with your little brother.

297
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
You do end up doing your first hunt with your stepdad.

298
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
What was that all about?

299
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
That was, you know, he grew up in a real small town in eastern Oregon, Echo Oregon.

300
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And so they would do this big deer camp.

301
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
So it's a tradition every year that have a deer camp where they'd have a wood stove and a big, you know,

302
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
like a outfitters tent.

303
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
They'd play cards and drink and, you know, that was, that was rifle deer hunting.

304
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
So like I say in the book, you know, I got ahead into my stepdad for even taking us over there because I guarantee his brothers,

305
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
which were just they're all bad asses pretty intimidating like ranch guys, you know, big,

306
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
they had a big ranch outside of Echo Oregon.

307
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And then we got these kids, you know, Greg steps on.

308
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
They're probably like, what is this?

309
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
You know, guys, they don't want kids around, right?

310
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And so I did, meaning my brother were out.

311
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And I saw these deer coming up the hill.

312
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And I thought I saw a spike horn on one of them, which made it legal.

313
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
So it was because it was a buck, had to be a buck.

314
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And I shot it. My brother said, you shot it, though.

315
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And I'm like, no, I didn't, I didn't know for sure.

316
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
I was like pretty sure, but I was 100% sure.

317
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
After he said that, I was like, oh my God.

318
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
So, you know, what's the biggest stroke you could do?

319
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Shoot so many illegal animals, right?

320
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
So anyway, it turns out it was legal and I got it.

321
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
That was my first deer and I was 15.

322
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And did you get like the rush?

323
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Did you enjoy that?

324
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
I don't remember that part.

325
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
I just remember maybe I finally did something good.

326
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Like, like, get approval from the man.

327
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
So.

328
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Now despite everything and I like I said, I skip them through a bunch of the book.

329
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
There's more detail in here.

330
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
But you eventually say this, it's easy to use your childhood as a crutch.

331
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Instead of seeing it as a chisel, there are a lot of divorces out there.

332
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
So that means a lot of kids come from broken homes.

333
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I always hear people say, my family is so dysfunctional.

334
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Using it as an excuse or something.

335
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
I really have valid excuse because everybody's family is dysfunctional in some way.

336
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
There are so many crutches people want to use to justify themselves.

337
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
But for me, you have to eliminate every single one of them.

338
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Get rid of them all.

339
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Then tell yourself, it's up to you.

340
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
What are you going to do now that you let go of all those crutches?

341
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I could blame alcoholism on a shitty childhood, but I don't.

342
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Blaming others isn't an easy way out.

343
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Solid advice.

344
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
You got to take ownership of what's going on in your world.

345
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Stream ownership.

346
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.000
That's a good call.

347
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
It's a good idea.

348
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
You know, I was just talking to some people this past past week.

349
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
And I was saying, isn't it crazy?

350
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I said, I wrote this book.

351
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And what we wrote about in this book is, hey, you should take responsibility for your actions.

352
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
That's the main underlying premise.

353
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
It isn't it shocking that people almost treat that like a novel idea.

354
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
But wait, let me jot this down.

355
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
And the thing that I was also explaining this group of people is that it's really heavy.

356
00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:04.000
When you start to look at your, you know, you look at your life, you look at your health, you look at your business, you look at your family, you look at your relationships.

357
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
And you look at all those things that are messed up in all those areas.

358
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And when you say all those things, all those problems in my business, my life, my health, all those things are my fault.

359
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
That's really a heavy weight to bear.

360
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
But it's also extremely liberating because if it's all your fault, you're the one that can fix it.

361
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
You're the one that can get your business back, you can repair the relationships, you can get yourself healthy.

362
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
You can take control of all those things.

363
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And that's the exact same thing you're saying here, when you're just blaming your childhood, your parents or your alcohol, the alcohol, all these other things.

364
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Then you just become a victim to those things and that's not what can you change.

365
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.000
You're just a victim.

366
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
It's happening to you and you need to go make things happen yourself, not let them happen to you.

367
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Definitely one of the underlying themes in this book you put out.

368
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Fast forward a little bit to high school, which you start to get into as a freshman entering a new high school.

369
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I had no confidence in zero success to point to or build momentum off of life got worse after I decided to live with my dad when he moved to Portland.

370
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Suddenly I found myself in this big school, I didn't want to attend where I didn't know anybody.

371
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I struggled in my classes, I earn mostly d's as a freshman, I ate like shit and wasn't active, so I started gaining weight and to make matters worse, act me became an issue.

372
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Basically, your teenager too and it's just going to happen.

373
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
But there was some studs, I'd see the studs and they didn't see my heads.

374
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And they didn't seem overweight or looking down at the floor as they walked by everybody.

375
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
So, wasn't everybody.

376
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
That's a rough one.

377
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
You said this though, fast forward a little bit, soon I realized things had to change.

378
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.000
That the situation in Portland was dire, feeling alone and isolated caused me not to give any effort to school or make friends, my grades were all d's.

379
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I was overweight and insecure, so I moved back with my mom for my sophomore junior and senior years.

380
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I knew it hurt my dad, but I was miserable and felt desperate.

381
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
I then attended Mohawk High School and what is it, Marcola?

382
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yep, in Marcola. It was a small school and a small town. Marcola was a logging community with a lot of guys working out the woods. I love growing up in a small town, but like many others from humbling, humble beginnings, I carried low expectations and no dreams.

383
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
I wasn't looking down the road.

384
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000
The change of schools didn't help me because even though I never did my homework and I wasn't considered smart, I also wasn't dumb.

385
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I began to get good grades. I ended up getting straight days when I was a senior.

386
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
It's a freaking dramatic change.

387
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I got so lucky because I joined the military and I just got put on a path.

388
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
This is what you got to do.

389
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Now that structure is important.

390
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Freaking so good.

391
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Now you're in a playing football.

392
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And do you think that impacted sort of, you start playing football. You start having some structure and discipline around that. Does that help your grades? You want to get good grades just to play football or anything like that?

393
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just had a little, I felt smaller school. Maybe he's back in the small pond again.

394
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:38.000
So I felt a more confident and then playing building a bond with people like the other guys on the team and on our, my road, we lived on the winland road. So there's a bunch of good athletes that live there. So we'd get together and play basketball or football.

395
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And so just that, just competing. I think competition is what is what life, I mean, that's kind of a mistake.

396
00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:11.000
I felt for a long time I made with the raise of my own kids is I learned right there that life is competition and competition is what made me like, hey, I got, I have to go one on one with, we just do these drills like football, one on one. You try to get over this line. They try to get over this line. It's just whoever can you stop them or he can he stop you.

397
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:38.000
So I realize those battles, that's what makes especially a man is like, we got to compete. That's what we're here for. So when I kind of skip to head, but with my kids, I like, no, you guys life is going to break you if you're not built for this shit. So then I thought, well, maybe that pushed them too hard to compete. So it's like, you know, how life is you're like, one all one way or all the other.

398
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:49.000
But anyway, I was learning how to compete there and it gave me confidence. And you start running then too. And you had a buddy Donnie Manila, is it?

399
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And you guys are sort of sort of sort of best friends scenario and he's he's a quarterback. Yep.

400
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And you're his wide receiver. Yep. So you guys are bros out freaking. Oh, yeah, practicing every. Yeah, and shape and getting half grit.

401
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Yeah. You talk about the fact that you're you kind of had to be self sufficient. I mean, this whole time, which is definitely good. Yeah.

402
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yeah, it's tough at that time, but it's good for any any person. Yeah, eventually you're going to have to, you know, take care of yourself.

403
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Yeah, you know, going back to that competition thing. I know in the SEAL team is we always joke around like if you're with another SEAL, whatever you're doing is a race.

404
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Well, whether or not, sometimes it can get pretty stupid, because sure it's cool when you're running arts, cool when you're shooting, but then it's like, hey, we're going to go drink.

405
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Let's see if you can do better. Yeah, not as great to win that one.

406
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Yeah, that's not a great one.

407
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:59.000
You also end up going to your grandma's house, which seems like, I'm like, oh, that's that's quaint, but it's a 20 mile bike ride. You got it. Yeah, so it's a 40 mile round trip.

408
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
What are you doing up there?

409
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:13.000
She lived in town, so she lived by Hayward Field. I lived in the house skirts on this in that small town. So I would ride there and sold two lane road all the way into town.

410
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And then I would hang out watching TV, walk up to Eldon's market. She had a tab up there, so to go buy stuff. Good end Amazon pool just kind of play basketball hang out, but that was like my I could get away from my stepdad. My dad could swing by because it was his mom. So I could see my dad maybe he still lived in town, but I don't know what he's doing.

411
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And so it's kind of a, you know, she'd give me mate, saltine crackers with butter on them, pretty good life. And then what your other, your other, I guess maybe your mom side had a ranch that ranch in Eastern Oregon.

412
00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:03.000
You went out, worked on that. Yeah, yeah, I did. My grandpa was a horse trainer and super tough. He's, you know, he left home. I think he lied to get in the service in his 15 or 16.

413
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:24.000
And, you know, was in the military just tough, tough dude. And he got into horses. He did rode yo when he got out of the service and then started training and and breeding horses. So I'd go over there and work and he had he was tough tough guy.

414
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Did you ever do rodeo? No. When I, when I watched that, like, yeah, I don't like to get injured, right? You know, I mean, none of us like to get injured, when you get injured, you know, you feel like it's horrible.

415
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Yeah, like the old world's on a part and I feel like the biggest whim when I get injured because I'm always like, I can't, you know, I've jumped my finger and my grips and I feel like just like, and then you know guys that you know have lost legs and they're driving on.

416
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:18.000
But man, when I watched rodeo people, how are they not getting majorly injured every freaking time? The durable damn. Yeah, that and I want to ever watch rugby. Yeah, those guys are tough too. I went watch a rugby game like a year ago and same thing every play. I was shuddering and you know, so, you know, a lot of times you get that feeling when you watch a sport, you like hockey do that.

417
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Yeah, you know, you're like, oh, yeah, I'll do that. If I trained hard, I could get in there. You know, you're, but I was watching this rugby game going, I actually don't want to do that.

418
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I actually do not want to do that. These guys are impact every single time. So you're out there and this is like typical ranch stuff where you're learning the like extra hard work is getting after it. Yeah, yeah, just get up early, get a little horses fed and watered.

419
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I would, because he had race horses. So he bred quarter horses and I would go and warm them up before the races. So it's called a jocky boy. And so I'd get on there.

420
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And to do that, I had to know horses. The horse can tell whether, you know, the person on them knows what the fuck they're doing, especially horses that are all wound up for the races. It's, that was pretty intense, but I like doing it.

421
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:23.000
How long do it take you to get comfortable on the horses? Was that like your introduction to it that summer? No, I would, I would ride every time I went there.

422
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:31.000
So you kind of grew up doing it. Yeah. And then when I worked for him, he, I'm trying to think, I think he paid me.

423
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:51.000
So it seems like it was 100 and for some reason, it's 76 a month, but then I had to pay for all my own stuff. So like food and water. Yeah, and like, I'm, I remember he took me to, to buy clothes like jeans and a cowboy hat and things like this and that came out of 100, 7 years.

424
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I thought he was hooking me up. Now, Grandpa Bob, you got a different way. No, no, he was, yeah.

425
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:08.000
So you learn a lot from him and, and I'm a fast forward a little bit. You say I learned something else from Grandpa Bob, I was taught that tomorrow is not guaranteed.

426
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
My mom's mother drove her car over from their ranch in eastern Oregon to visit, to visit and go to my homecoming football game on Friday.

427
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Late Thursday night, the sheriff's department called and told us that Papa had died and an automobile accident.

428
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:35.000
It was very painful to hear this since Grandpa Bob was a huge part of my teenage years. The following night, the homecoming game was tough to get through, but I had a good game and made some difficult catches.

429
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Papa taught me to give everything you have each day and the only thing that mattered was winning.

430
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
When the horse wins, the trainer, the jockey and the family get to take a photo in the winter circle.

431
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Anything less than that is a failure.

432
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Check.

433
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
That was, was that your senior year then?

434
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
That was junior junior junior year.

435
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Fast forward a little bit. You graduated earlier. You graduated when you were 17 years old.

436
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
And then you get a job at Safeway.

437
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Yeah, I kind of forgot this part of the book, but my, it was weird. My family moved when I was 17.

438
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
So they, they were going to go to Arizona and I just said, I'm not going to Arizona.

439
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And so I stayed and they moved. They only stayed there two weeks, but they moved back when I never moved back home.

440
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Wait, what did you get like a place to stay with your buddies or something? No, I stayed with my girlfriend. She was a senior too. So we're kind of kind of sounds odd.

441
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
I mean, right now if I imagine my daughter, like us moving my daughter to senior, I couldn't imagine this.

442
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Hey, good luck. Keep in touch.

443
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Yeah, and by the way, moving with some other high senior.

444
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I know anyway, so I stayed, they moved back and never moved back in and then I ended up getting the job at Safeway.

445
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Cause I wanted to wait my vanilla. He was a year behind me. So I learned I needed, we're going to go to a chart plate called football together.

446
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
So I worked for a year in between waiting.

447
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And then you end up getting to Southern Oregon State and you try out for the football team.

448
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
You say after I tried, after trying to make the team I read, she ordered for Southern Oregon State, meaning everyday I practiced against the starting defense.

449
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
There were definitely some beasts out there on the field. I definitely wasn't one of them.

450
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
It was fun, especially since there were some elite athletes on the field who eventually made it to the NFL.

451
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
The irony of college was that throughout my high school years, I never drank even one beer.

452
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000
All I cared about was sports and grades. I knew I wasn't an elite athlete, but I'd still tried my hardest, especially because I wanted to impress my dad.

453
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
What I learned at Southern Oregon was that even though I wasn't good enough to play college football, I knew how to party.

454
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
I drank a lot of beer and eventually went back to Eugene with this new mastered skill.

455
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
So you didn't drink at all growing up.

456
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
And then you get to college.

457
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
It just like the stereotypical friggin, you could just go get it.

458
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Yeah, I mean, you know how if you're on the football team, you can go to any party, you know, always girls always, always, you know, we had this dorm that was asked but haul was just football player.

459
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000
So there's always girls there. There's like a big open shower and there'd be guys and girls in the shower to say, it's like, I'm like this.

460
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
I don't know what heaven is like, but feels like it should be like this.

461
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
So anyway, it was, it was a lot different.

462
00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:02.000
One of my buddies in the Siltians played football at University of Texas and obviously it's like a religion down there and I was like, what was it like, you know, being on the football team down there and he goes,

463
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
like a jallie green giant walking the earth.

464
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
He said, you literally, he said he literally could do anything he wanted to have.

465
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.000
You know, you know, you know, you know, he could never bought a beer, you know, feels like the seas parted when he showed up. He said it was freaking ridiculous.

466
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
So how long did you stay there for?

467
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
This year. So one year.

468
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Yeah, one year. But yeah, I mean, so it wasn't like Texas, but for that little, that was the Ashwin Oregon, for that little town.

469
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Yeah, it was kind of a big deal if you're there.

470
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Yeah, it's fun.

471
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
It won't made you stop.

472
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
What made you decide to not go to college anyway?

473
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I just didn't have money. So nobody's paying. I had financial aid and I was getting money. And so it was about 5,000 a year living down there. And I was a walk on. So I didn't get any scholarship or anything like that.

474
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
So I just didn't have money.

475
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Yeah, did you have any vision?

476
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Yeah, because I think a lot of kids just go to college because that's like you're supposed to what it is.

477
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Yeah, it's just like that's like the normal chain of command as you got to get your college degree.

478
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
So we tell I tell my kids, Tanner who's in the service. He tried.

479
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
That's what my oldest one, but I went through first and you know, told him, no, you're going to go to school.

480
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
You're going to get a degree and I could tell.

481
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
It's just not happening.

482
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
But anyway, I've found it that trap too.

483
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Yeah, no, you go to college.

484
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Yeah, especially you go there for a year and you're like, what am I even doing here?

485
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Yeah, you know, I get in trunk, whatever spending money. Why, why have you been here?

486
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Yeah, I got decent grades. I mean, I took creative writing. So it's like I always liked writing. So at least I did that.

487
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Yeah, that's an interesting thread that's throughout the book is your, I know obviously this book is sort of the apex of that journey.

488
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
But yeah, the fact that you were always kind of into writing.

489
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:09.000
So you get you leave college, go back, go back home and now you're working.

490
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
You're working in a warehouse for $4.72 an hour according to the book.

491
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.000
That's right.

492
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000
As a working part time, going to go into Lane Community College and, you know, my, my truck, little Toyota tool,

493
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000
dry was just full of beer cans all the time because we just go up in the woods and build a fire at the rock pit and drink and

494
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
That's what I mean, I would go scout deer. I always like taking pictures.

495
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000
So I go look for bucks and bowls and try to take pictures of them in the mornings, but then I would, you know, drink for the weekends and the afternoon.

496
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Yeah, you say, here, wasn't like I was letting anybody down. Nobody expected anything from Cameron Haynes.

497
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
So I didn't expect anything out of myself. No.

498
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Fast forward a little bit.

499
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Thankfully, Roy kept on me and kept encouraging me to bow on telling me it's way better than hunting with a gun.

500
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000
That there were less people and that I would enjoy it. Roy got me started, but the only way I could build confidence in anything was to go out and do it.

501
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Soon I focused my energy on bow hunting like athletics. It provided a challenge.

502
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I found the perfect thing to work hard at something that challenged me that not everybody was good at when I was successful at bow hunting.

503
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.000
It gave me a lot of confidence for young man having confidence and getting positive reinforcement in anything was a powerful spark for change in my life.

504
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Here's the truth. I'm an average guy who has experienced above average bow hunting success over the past three decades.

505
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
One thing is for sure if I can do it anyone can. I came from nothing and had no one pushing me or even believing in me.

506
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000
For this reason, my story proves that in bow hunting, the most average person can achieve the grandest of dreams.

507
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
There's a lot of hell of a lot of hard work in between average person and dreams on that one.

508
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
So how did you know Roy? Roy Roth?

509
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:20.000
He went to a Mohawk. He was a year ahead of me. He was in his wife and my class. He was like the brain of the class. I think she could have got valedictorian maybe.

510
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So that was Jill.

511
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:35.000
But we didn't hang out because he, I just did the football basketball baseball. He had a trap line and would always be in the woods trapping. He did play football. He's good at football and baseball, but no basketball.

512
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:44.000
But we didn't really hang out or anything. But he, he was always the guy if I had a hunting question. I'd be like, I'm just, yes, Roy. He's like the best in the school.

513
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:56.000
And so he, from there, we kind of built a relationship when I was still rifle hunting and then he inspired me to buy a bow and get going down that road.

514
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:06.000
You say I run into a lot of people who are new to bow hunting. They get a bow going on in the discover it's just too difficult. So they quit. I understand.

515
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I missed 16 deer the first year I went bow hunting. So I've been there. What if I'd given up after the first year? There's the question once again, what if?

516
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Here's the reason why bow hunting is both exciting and excruciating. It's difficult and frustrating as hell, especially when you're used to hunting with a rifle. People become used to the ritual of seeing an animal in rifle range and then boom, it's over.

517
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:42.000
It's done. You've made the shot. The animal is dead. With a bow being in bow range doesn't mean anything. Even if the animal is in rifle range, when your bow hunting, the hunt has just started.

518
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Moving from rifle range into bow range means you're moving into the animal's red zone and that ups the challenge immensely and bow hunting. There's no guarantee it's going to work out.

519
00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:12.000
For me, I never like to fail. I didn't want to be a failure with the bow. So after that first year of killing the spike bow elk, my second season behind the bow, I killed a pope and young three by three black tail, a rag horn five by five bow and a bear with a $200 bow and using $30 binoculars.

520
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:25.000
I can only afford to hunt an organ instead of traveling anywhere out of the state. I bought three tags and filled three tags. The second year of bow hunting wasn't just memorable for me. It was monumental.

521
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:50.000
You came out of the gate. Going hard. Yeah, I mean that was a finely found because as you, you know, we've kind of went through this journey. I wasn't good. Really not like a natural at anything is all work and then I got to bow hunting and I'm like, well, I can work hard and then have these.

522
00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:07.000
What I considered a very, you know, pretty high above average, maybe excellent results and I didn't know anybody killing a bull buck and bear with their bow that was like there's like a we'd lump those all together in one word bull buck bear.

523
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And if you could get that done is your bow. That's freaking bad. Yeah, it wasn't happening. So I felt really getting that was just my second season. So it gave me a lot of confidence.

524
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:31.000
How many arrows were you shooting in the offices and getting ready for that were you were you kind of obsessed out of the gate? Yeah, yeah, I shot way more than that I do now. Yeah, I mean, I had to shot for hours. Yeah, loved it.

525
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:44.000
How did you get the feel for like the hunt part the wind was Roy teaching you that stuff? No, that was just, you know,

526
00:48:44.000 --> 00:49:06.000
I was like, right, for hunting, you don't really need to know that, but I was in the woods a lot, you know, whether I was hunting or going with somebody. So as learning, you kind of hunting is all about, well, not all about there's a lot of different things that you got to read the country, you got to read the animal behavior is a big part of it learning their tendencies and then what you can get away with them.

527
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:20.000
And I see you and so I would, as I said, you know, I would go out and take pictures a lot too. So I always out trying to get photos and then hunting all the time. So I just was naturally just learning more all these reps all this time in the and the mountains.

528
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:43.000
So then when it came time for to actually try to kill something, I had a big advantage because I had just been out there at the time spent, you know, and I just felt pretty natural, but I still had to learn about the wind had to learn about when an arrow hits an animal and you're reading the blood trail where that blood's from the injury you've caused the animal.

529
00:49:43.000 --> 00:50:04.000
You know, how to trail that thing, whether it's hoof marks in soft soil or rocks overturned different things. Furns would be kind of indicate the direction of travel. So you had still had to look a lot of woodsmanship goes in to successful bohani. So I had to learn that that just takes time.

530
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Were you going with anybody? Were you primarily like that first year where you got the bullbuck and bear.

531
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Booze was anyone going with you? My brother went sometimes. I think when I killed that buck, he was there too.

532
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
And then the bull, let me think, know the bull eyes by myself, bear by myself.

533
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Yeah, I guess the reason I'm kind of pausing here is like I said me being an amateur hunter and having been guided on hunts by experts.

534
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Or sometimes even multiple sometimes I've gone out with both John W. and a guide with me at the same time. So there's like two people that are experts.

535
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Right. And the amount of information that they're feeding me, the amount of things that are going on during a hunt is there's so much going on.

536
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:12.000
I mean, the reaction of the animals, the wind, the terrain, like all those things are going on. I've had when I've hunted, I've had people feeding me that information, you know.

537
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:26.000
And for you to be out there on your second season pulling that off, that's freaking impressive, man. And I don't want, and the other reason I'm kind of like diving into this is because I said, oh, how many arrows did you shoot?

538
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
And shoot in the arrows?

539
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Yeah, you've got to be able to shoot the arrows, but there's so much more to it that I didn't want to make it sound like, oh, hey, if I shoot a bunch of arrows, and I can hit that target at it, freaking 60 yards, I'm going to be good to go.

540
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:56.000
I think hunting is like when you're driving somewhere, and if you're not driving, not really paying attention. You know what I mean? I feel like hunting can be like that too. If you're not making the calls, you can have people telling you, just like you can have somebody drive you down here.

541
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:19.000
If somebody's driving, like if I had to repeat how I got to right here to the studio today, I took an Uber, so I don't know. But when you're hunting, when you're making the calls that it might be a rough go, you might fail a lot, but you're also learning more than I think you have some great mentors on the hunt.

542
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:28.000
But I think it's hard that's a hard situation to learn that firsthand experience also because you're kind of, you're doing what they say. You know what I mean?

543
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:44.000
So for me, it was, it was hard, but it was a big advantage to learn that on my own, make those mistakes on my own. And it just, I think being by myself so much as a kid, I was fine being by myself.

544
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:52.000
I was used to being alone my whole life really. So just being out in the woods, that's just, that was an easy transition.

545
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Now I'm by myself, but I'm doing something. I'm not by myself, you know, staring at the wall, even she does.

546
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Yeah, that's again, just to reiterate the amount that goes in to pulling this off is ridiculously hard. These, this is a freaking challenging, challenging thing to do.

547
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
So I just don't want to, don't want to short sell it at all.

548
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Yeah, I mean, there's still hunts now, even after all these years where I'm like, I wonder, I'm like, how have I ever killed anything with an arrow?

549
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.000
I mean, it just seems, it feels impossible on some of these hunts because it's not just getting close.

550
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I mean, that's, you find the animal, that's okay. Now we've started something, at least we've got a target, right?

551
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:55.000
But then so much has to go right. And then if you're trying to film as you know, I think you know, some of yours has been filmed and other guys are there.

552
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
So it's like there's however much, you know, three guys, three times and always three times a sand, three times a movement.

553
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000
It's tough.

554
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
There's a lot of shit that can go sideways.

555
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:18.000
And it does, and so again, what I was, my point was sometimes I wonder myself, I'm like, I don't know how I've ever done this. It feels, feels like it's just not going to happen.

556
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Well, you've made it happen a lot.

557
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Get into your third season. You say I was invaded by invited by Wayne and Dakota, join him in the country.

558
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
He had hunted since he was a young boy, Wayne owned the bull rack.

559
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
And I only say it like that because it's kind of like legendary, even though it never even been there.

560
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Yeah. The archery pro shop in Springfield, Oregon opened in 1971. Wayne Roy Roth,

561
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Dwayne Levitt, right?

562
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Jeff Brooks and I ventured toward the legendary Steans Mountain.

563
00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:02.000
And there, you say this, my shot was perfect.

564
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:10.000
The arrow went into the last rib and stopped at the far side of the shoulder, meaning I only had one hole, the entrance from which to leave blood.

565
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000
I was using a thunderhead 125s, which are good tough heads that did the job.

566
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.000
That one perfect arrow put the bull down quickly, even though I had scant blood trail to follow.

567
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000
The Roosevelt bull was a big-bodied beast though, and is heavy hoofs scarred the soft soil deeply.

568
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
I followed his fresh deep-cutting tracks for 50 yards down the hill before pulling back a wet fur bow,

569
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
revealing the fallen beast in a tango of fireweed.

570
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
This dark antlered 5x5 was my best bull to date.

571
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
I remember every detail of these hunts, like they were yesterday, hence the saying,

572
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000
the beast is dead, long live the mighty beast.

573
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Bow hunting had gotten in my soul.

574
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:05.000
At that time I had no idea how would it end up directing my every step through the journey of life.

575
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Chuck.

576
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Despite my growth and success in Bow hunting, I was still going nowhere in my life.

577
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
I was 22 to 23 years old.

578
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
It's such a good contrast, like you're kicking ass out in the woods.

579
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
And yet, 23 years old living with four guys drank beer all the time.

580
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000
One of my roommates got two DUIs and three weeks, both while driving my truck.

581
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
I was glad I hadn't, I wasn't driving those times, it was just a matter of luck.

582
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
More a matter of luck than good decision making.

583
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
I just never got caught.

584
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
I wasn't living healthfully, and still didn't have a real sense of purpose.

585
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
I wasn't accountable for anything or anybody.

586
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
I felt shitty all the time.

587
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
A wake-up call arrived when I crashed my truck one night while driving drunk.

588
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
I was driving too fast and flipped the vehicle, rolling it.

589
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
The roof was crushed all the way down to the top of the seat.

590
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
The truck was totaled.

591
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Of course, I didn't remember a thing.

592
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Damn, just straight black out driving.

593
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Yeah.

594
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
I could have easily died or killed someone.

595
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Did I wake up?

596
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
No, not yet.

597
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Did I see some connection between me walking away from the crash.

598
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000
And my dad walking away from his was I following in his alcoholic footsteps.

599
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
My life would become a living living with a bunch of guys just partying,

600
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
basically working during the week going to clubs and weekends, just drinking at the apartment

601
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
or on the lake.

602
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
It was a great life.

603
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Yeah, I would usually on the weekends.

604
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
I would get up and go.

605
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
We lived on the second floor of the Chase Village apartments,

606
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
and I'd go out and look and see if my truck was there.

607
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
And I had driven my truck.

608
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
And I'd have to go see.

609
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
So if the truck was there, I'd go back in.

610
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
I'd be like, where's my truck?

611
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
You remember you left to the Scandia days or whatever.

612
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
They had all the likes.

613
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
No, damn.

614
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
So just, you know, just being an idiot.

615
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Yeah.

616
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
You say the same year, I killed my first bill in 1989.

617
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
I wrote my first hunting article.

618
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000
I was going to go to the Bulls, Bughals, and Baches for Western Bow Hunter.

619
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
So you're getting a writing pretty quickly out of the gate with this.

620
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
It's cool in the book.

621
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
You got a bunch of the articles.

622
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Cliped out.

623
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
So you're on this kind of, well, I'll use your word.

624
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Luser, path.

625
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Yeah.

626
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
I wouldn't say that, but you got into the book.

627
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
You say being a loser isn't cool.

628
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
And not being a loser, Dad.

629
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000
When Tanner, our first son, was born in 1993, something inside of me switched.

630
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
They say, parenthood changes everything, and it did for me.

631
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Suddenly, I wasn't just on my own.

632
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Now I was affecting other people's lives.

633
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
I got to be an example.

634
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Alcohol was poison.

635
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
I had seen what alcohol did to my dad, ruining what he could have been.

636
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Something incredible.

637
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000
And I was seeing it do the same thing to me.

638
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Sorry, stop drinking.

639
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Alcohol wasn't going to help me in any area of my life.

640
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Especially with my hunting.

641
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
I'm not judging anybody else, but for me, I had to quit drinking.

642
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:15.000
So Tanner, coming along is really the seems like from the book, it's the catalyst for

643
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
real change in your life.

644
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Yeah.

645
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000
I mean, people always say, and maybe it's true for them, but they say, well, you know, I don't

646
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
know that there's this thing, like if your father's an alcoholic, then you have a greater

647
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
chance being an alcoholic and like this keeps this whole thing going, right?

648
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
And then people learn from it, this and that, and it all sounds good.

649
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
I didn't really, I knew all that.

650
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
I didn't really care.

651
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Even when Tanner was born, I felt different, and I was like, okay, this isn't just me being a 20

652
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000
summer-year-old guy, just going to the club.

653
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
That's what it feels like everybody does.

654
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But then with the kid, but then still, I was like, well, I should, I probably shouldn't be a

655
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
dipshit like this, but I still was.

656
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I still, I'm not drink for a little while, and I, you know, whatever, go back out.

657
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You know, Tanner was around, so my wife, we were just in our 20s, you know, mid 20s.

658
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And I wasn't, I was still doing stupid shit.

659
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And so it wasn't just like, right when he was born, it still took a while.

660
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Right?

661
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And I still was still fucked up.

662
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You know, I mean, I would still drink and drive, I remember leaving the Oregon football game.

663
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I'd drive in over all the cones and this cop jumped out, told me to pull over.

664
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And I was just, why am I driving over the cones?

665
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I don't know.

666
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It's half time drinking for the, for the whole game.

667
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And I had to do a walking test, like, a DUI test there with everybody leaving the Oregon football

668
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
game, you know, and somehow I passed.

669
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I have no idea how, but I never got a DUI, but the point is, it's like, it still took a

670
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
little bit.

671
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It wasn't just a light switch.

672
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I still, you know, I hadn't run around a marathon yet, so I hadn't really tapped

673
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
into like dedication.

674
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I was having success with the bow.

675
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I was having a little thing.

676
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I still didn't have a great job.

677
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
What was your job at this time?

678
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I was still in that warehouse.

679
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I worked at that warehouse.

680
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I was part time in the Northwest School, and I got full time.

681
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And guys would kind of listen to me, so they made me a lead.

682
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And I worked there for nine years.

683
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And then by kind of by the end of that nine years, I was starting to figure things out a

684
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
little bit.

685
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And I got this job, same job I have right now at Springfield, Utility Board.

686
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And it's like, you know, like we're here in San Diego, San Diego, Water and Power, whatever

687
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
it's called, it's always a good, good job.

688
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And for me, for somebody like me, a job at a, I mean, just a

689
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
utility, it's about as good as it's going to get.

690
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Right?

691
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
People are always going to need water and power.

692
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I mean, have a paycheck, good benefits.

693
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Like, okay, this is kind of total stability.

694
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

695
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And I could provide for my family.

696
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I still felt like a kid, but I'm like, kind of supposed to have all these, you know, these

697
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
pay all these bills and have cars and have this house and do all this, but I didn't feel like.

698
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I, I don't know, it just felt like still like a lot for me.

699
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And so I, I ended up getting the job on the construction crew at the Springfield Utility Board.

700
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Yeah, so I started there at like $7 an hour.

701
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I'd moved up at the warehouse.

702
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I was, they promoted me to supervisors the same day.

703
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I gave my notice and quit because I got hired at the utility, but so I was making like 13

704
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
there and then I had to go back down to seven to start at the, at the utility board.

705
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But yeah, so just trying to get it figured out.

706
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah.

707
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Back to the hunting a little bit.

708
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You see in the book, it's been said that life offers two paths, one easy and one hard.

709
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
As Roy and I entered the unforgiving sanctuary of the Eagle Cap wilderness for the first time in

710
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
witness the awe inspiring.

711
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
While Lawa, how do you say that?

712
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Well, Lawa mountains in northeast Oregon.

713
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
It was obvious that we had chosen the latter.

714
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
We were always drawn toward the more difficult path to us.

715
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The longer was always better.

716
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
You see, talking about Roy a little bit here.

717
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Both hunting in general is hard.

718
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
There are lots of tough men who do it, but it's not easy.

719
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
The mountains can break even the toughest man.

720
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Roy, rough as the toughest human I ever met and ever seen out in the mountains.

721
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Hands down Roy was the toughest bow hunter I'd ever seen and he always carried the best attitude.

722
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I learned so much from him.

723
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
He is a big part of the reason I am the person I am today.

724
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
As a kid, I always knew Roy was good in the woods.

725
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
He could always get the best fishing holes before the rest of us.

726
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000
We nicknamed him Gazelle Roy because he was big, but moved like a gazelle.

727
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
He was a great athlete.

728
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
He played football and he was really good at baseball playing third baseman.

729
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
From the moment Roy told me I should start bow hunting, we connected and hit it off.

730
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
From then on, we started hunting together and we just clicked because we had no limits on how much misery

731
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
we could suffer to chase success.

732
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
You guys rolled out into this mountain wilderness area.

733
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:47.000
You encounter another hunter who tells you guys about this spot where Billy Cruz used to go.

734
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
What's the legend of Billy Cruz?

735
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Billy Cruz was just a badass.

736
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
He started Oregon bow company, which was the bow I shot at that time.

737
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
In junction city back there in Oregon.

738
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I actually didn't know Billy Cruz.

739
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I knew of him and it seemed as a picture as well.

740
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
This dentist that was in the wilderness.

741
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
He said, we came from this trailhead way back here, something like 20 miles away.

742
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I said we just want to get away from people.

743
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
He was like, oh, okay, he goes well.

744
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I can send you to a place and nobody goes.

745
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
He goes, it's two rugged for horses, two steep for men, all this stuff.

746
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
He goes the only person that ever goes there is Billy Cruz.

747
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
That sounds good.

748
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
You and Roy are like, yeah, it was awesome.

749
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That was, but also I kind of, I did learn something from that too because what I learned at that time

750
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
has been proven over and over again is rugged country like that.

751
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:59.000
If men who spend a lot of time in it die often, it's just part of the the mountains are so unforgiving

752
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
and Billy Cruz died back there.

753
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And he died in a plane crash, but it's like if while he's scouting elk in those mountains.

754
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And I just, it just gets proven over and over again.

755
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000
People go in the get a taste of the mountains they come back, but the longer you spend there the more you're kind of,

756
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
you know, you're just playing the rock and roll on the dice.

757
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
But in the meantime, we did go there and I ended up hunting back in that same country for many years,

758
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Roy moved to Alaska after that first season, but yeah, it was amazing.

759
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
We never saw anybody back there.

760
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Super rugged.

761
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
This is kind of cool.

762
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You say, you know, one of your favorite books of all time is hunting with the bow and arrow by Dr.

763
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Sachs and Pope written in 1923.

764
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And you call out a couple of parts on page 181 it reads,

765
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
we also began preparing ourselves for the contest.

766
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Although habitually in good physical condition, we undertook special training for the big event.

767
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
In this case, he and young were preparing for a grizzly bow hunt, Pope continues.

768
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
By running, the use of dumbbells and other gymnastic practices,

769
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
we strengthened our muscles and increased our endurance.

770
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Regarding the backcountry hunt, he writes,

771
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
we were there to win and nothing else matter mattered.

772
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Adding later, we were trained down to the raw hide and sinu,

773
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
keyed to alertness and ready for any emergency.

774
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Seems like that could be like the root of you saying,

775
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
hey, I can get them freaking better shape for this shit.

776
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah, I mean, there's 100 years ago.

777
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And those guys knew that at that time that,

778
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
hey, we need to be out our best to be in these mountains and get animals killed with an arrow.

779
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
100 years ago, these guys are freaking training training.

780
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Yeah.

781
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Did you like make that connection?

782
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
No.

783
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:04.000
No, because when I started training, so hunting the hunter community is steeped in tradition,

784
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
obviously, the tradition isn't guys like Saxon, Pope and Art Young.

785
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It's guys that like maybe my stepdad who they're just getting away,

786
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
going to deer camp.

787
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
We're not training for this.

788
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
This is kind of a vacation.

789
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So when I first got into it, I started doing this running and doing this thing.

790
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I need to be a little better.

791
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I got a lot of pushback from the hunting community itself.

792
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And I said, you know, you don't need to run a marathon to kill an elk,

793
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
but I know this guy and that guy and they kill animals all the time,

794
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
and they're overweight.

795
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And Roy was actually over, you know, he's a big dude overweight.

796
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
But the difference is he was just so much tougher and better than most guys.

797
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So they would, but they'd use that as an example of why you don't need to be in shape.

798
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And I'd be like, well, okay, you're not Roy.

799
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
First of all.

800
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And but I got for years pushback and still probably still do.

801
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I just don't pay attention to him.

802
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But people hunters just don't want to, because it kind of puts the owner's back on them.

803
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Like, God, do I have to take this shit more serious?

804
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
What do I got to do here?

805
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Ah.

806
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000
So like you said, Roy moves to Alaska.

807
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And you go, it's pretty, not funny, it's not the word, but you can't find anybody else really to hunt with.

808
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
No.

809
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
He must have been one of those bastards just like strong and can just carry his weight.

810
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It's no factor.

811
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
No, he, I mean, there's a, I can't remember if I talk about it in there,

812
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
but one time we're on Prince of Wales Island.

813
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Here's his attitude wrapped up.

814
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
To hunt Prince of Wales for Black Bear, you need a boat.

815
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
It's all on the island chain.

816
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
You got to go to open water sometimes.

817
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
There's tides coming in and out.

818
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
So there's, there's, the water is pretty dangerous out there.

819
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
But we had boat motor problems.

820
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And without a boat, the motor running right out there,

821
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
it was not only dangerous, but you couldn't get anywhere.

822
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So he's like, I'm going to take this motor off and go into town,

823
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Craig, Alaska, which is there in South East Alaska.

824
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And but it's about 15 miles on the water.

825
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And he had this little like 10 or 12 foot raft that he had to put a piece of plywood on,

826
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
put the motor on and kind of lay down and kind of hold the front of it because to get on

827
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
step that it was coming up, you know.

828
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And so he would have to lay and he did 15 miles all the way in there on a Sunday,

829
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
bought this new motor for 4,000 bucks.

830
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And it's all the way, I don't know, he got her right on actually a big ship.

831
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And I could see him.

832
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I was seeing him coming the next day and I'm like, look, I think I see Roy on there

833
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
and they're like toeing this little raft.

834
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Just tied to a rope behind it.

835
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And I'm like, so anyway, it was what, and he did this at midnight.

836
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
He took off.

837
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
He's like, well, no, this is what we got to do.

838
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Just buy himself by himself.

839
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
And when he bought this, you know, 4,000 dollar motor,

840
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
brought it back out, we're back in business, killing bear.

841
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
But that, that whatever it took,

842
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
that's the attitude right there, hey, oh, this isn't working.

843
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Here's what we got to do, whatever it takes to make this happen.

844
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Most people aren't like that.

845
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Yeah, no, that's, that's next level.

846
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Yeah.

847
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
You say then, after he moves to Alaska for the next 12 years,

848
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I ended up hunting in the sprawling, unforgiven eagle cap wilderness,

849
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
most of the time on my own.

850
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
My entire existence seemingly revolved around preparing for just one crack at the wilderness,

851
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
bulls and bucks where Billy cruised it walked.

852
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I learned more about myself on those solo haunts than I could have in a lifetime in the everyday world.

853
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
One of the things you've learned, you talk about, are you willing to bleed?

854
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
In most cases, it takes some blood to achieve your goals.

855
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The farther you go, the fewer who will be able to go,

856
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
or we willing to go with you.

857
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I knew that if I could get back farther into the wilderness,

858
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I could find better hunting.

859
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I could get away from other hunters if I wasn't better shape.

860
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And if I was mentally stronger, I could outlast anyone.

861
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
This is sort of like this.

862
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
It's really cool to read the book and there's so many good details in here

863
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
to see your evolution as you're in.

864
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Kind of pioneering this attitude of like,

865
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
oh, I can just outwork and go further and I'll end up being alone out there.

866
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Yeah.

867
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And that's what I want.

868
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
That's, that was the only way I could up my odds.

869
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Now, we get to go hunt some great country.

870
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Money can get you that opportunity,

871
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
or knowing the right people can get you that opportunity.

872
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So that ups your eyes a little bit.

873
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You're still very hard.

874
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
You know, as you know, still very hard.

875
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
But you'll earn opportunity.

876
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
But for me at that time, the only way to earn opportunity

877
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
was, I had no advantage.

878
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I had no money advantage.

879
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
All people in the regular society, they're smarter, more money, more connections,

880
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
more whatever.

881
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I always down at the bottom.

882
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
In the mountains, I'm like, okay, I call the shots back here now.

883
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
All those advantages you have on the outside, don't mean shit back here.

884
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Now, if I'm in better shape than you and I know this country better,

885
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and I'm willing to work harder than you,

886
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
this is, this is my country.

887
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
This is, I call the shots.

888
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
This is my domain.

889
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I'm laughing and smiling over here because all the money in the world

890
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
isn't going to carry your ass up that freaking hill.

891
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
No, that's it.

892
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And that's the first time I ever felt like, you know,

893
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
because I hadn't felt like shit my whole life, you know,

894
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.000
as far as, I don't know what, where I stood and I guess a ladder of success.

895
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And now, of a sudden, I'm like, what are you second?

896
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
This is different.

897
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
It felt different.

898
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
The challenge for me at that time was,

899
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I was trying not to be, I was selfish because it's,

900
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I mean, I found something that, like, for me was good,

901
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
but now I had family home, so I'd be back there all the time

902
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
and I'd be like, should I be back away from my family?

903
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Because it wasn't like a job.

904
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And were you making any kind of connection towards what it could turn into?

905
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
No, just a reason to just meet.

906
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
No, I was just, you know, this is just what I wanted to do.

907
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So it was like a selfish thing.

908
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Because people can justify all the time,

909
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
well, I gotta do this for work.

910
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So I gotta travel for work.

911
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And it's like, it gives us, it's easy to say,

912
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
well, you know, people have to do that.

913
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
We're providing it for the family.

914
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Something like that.

915
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I'm gonna sell an article for 50 bucks

916
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and be away from my family for 10 days.

917
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
That doesn't pencil out.

918
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
But it's just like, I felt like that's what I needed to do.

919
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Because when I wasn't doing that, I was at home.

920
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I was miserable.

921
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Then I felt like maybe I wanted to go drinking

922
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
or maybe how am I getting this, you know,

923
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
a buzz, I guess.

924
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
But I used to get home from work at like six o'clock.

925
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Maybe seven o'clock at night.

926
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Walking, put my work bag down, pick up my jitzie bag

927
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
and go to jitzie for two hours.

928
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And I did that every night.

929
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I did that every night.

930
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And I remember sometimes where my wife would be looking at me

931
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000
with just like a combination of anger

932
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
and lack of understanding, like,

933
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
like, like, what, like, what are you serious right now?

934
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Like, this is what you're doing.

935
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
You got three kids and you're home for nine minutes

936
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and you're gonna leave.

937
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And I did that every night.

938
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And you know, when I, when,

939
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
what was interesting was my wife eventually realized

940
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
that if I didn't do that,

941
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I had, I would, I would be,

942
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I would be, I wouldn't be happy.

943
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I would be like, like, not, not have a good attitude

944
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
about stuff, right?

945
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Because I felt like that was what I needed to do.

946
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And yeah, there's, I unfortunately,

947
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I never really thought about it as being selfish

948
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
until you just said that right now.

949
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I guess I realized that even at the time,

950
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
but I always kind of

951
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
kind of rationalize this thing where I'd kind of related

952
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
to my regular job, I'd say, well, hey, you know,

953
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I need to be able to do this in case I'd end up

954
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
on a situation where I gotta use this stuff in combat

955
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and I'd be kind of my rationalization.

956
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I'd even try and rationalize that to my wife sometimes,

957
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
but my wife, not an idiot, and she'd be like,

958
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
hey, listen, you got freaking a rifle, a pistol,

959
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and two knives, and you think you're gonna have to choke

960
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
a person I don't even know about.

961
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Yeah.

962
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So, yeah, I think it is, you know,

963
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000
you have some, some, like, primordial urges

964
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
as a human, you know, to fight or to hunt.

965
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Like, it seems like it's almost caveman brain.

966
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
For me, it got really focused on fighting.

967
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
For you, it got really focused on hunting.

968
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Both those are total primal instincts to have, you know?

969
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
So, here's an example.

970
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You got the book of how you're living your life.

971
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
On Friday afternoon, I leave work around 4pm,

972
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
driving through the North Portland, through North Portland,

973
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
arriving at 1 a.m. at my Eagle Cap Trailhead.

974
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I'd load up my pack and start walking.

975
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Try to get 12 miles or so in by first light,

976
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
once sleep, get back in there by first light Saturday morning,

977
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
be able to hunt or scout until Sunday,

978
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
then I would hike out and drive home Sunday night.

979
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Being back at work on Monday morning,

980
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
two nights, no sleep, two days,

981
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
it's scouting or hunting.

982
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
If it was the season, it was worth it.

983
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
These trips gave me the confidence to do my long,

984
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
so LeHonsh I was testing myself, passing each test.

985
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
What caught me, what caught me on that one was like,

986
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
this isn't even hunting season.

987
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
This is you're just going out there to scout

988
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
and get to know the terrain.

989
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah, so it's your wife's piss.

990
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Right, I mean, and I, so it kind of is frustrating

991
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
in a little bit, and at that time,

992
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I wasn't like, oh, I'm going to prove all these people wrong.

993
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I mean, kind of I was proving people wrong.

994
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I felt like, but it was more like I just felt like I would

995
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
need it to do that, or I wanted to do that,

996
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
maybe to be selfish.

997
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
But now people see like, where you are now,

998
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
you're going to be on your right of book, or you're teaching

999
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
leadership, and there's like people see everything,

1000
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
like you get a lot of attention, because now you're somebody.

1001
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
But it was the dues you paid going to every night you'd go

1002
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
to training after work, or if I'd do that.

1003
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
The reason why you get to here is because you had all that

1004
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
sacrifice, you made all those sacrifices for time

1005
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
and for work, and it's like, I wanted to ask those people,

1006
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
what the fuck are you doing?

1007
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
What your word? I mean, what were of you sacrificed?

1008
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Yeah, of course, that's easy to be invious of this.

1009
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
When you're like, oh, you got this,

1010
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
me followers in your sponsor to hear this, and that's like,

1011
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
yeah, that's what about all the grind.

1012
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And the grind where I would be back there,

1013
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
and I'd be like, I shouldn't be back here.

1014
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And I should be at home, I should be being a dad,

1015
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
and I should be this or that, and I'd be like, well,

1016
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
you can, and you kind of alluded to it,

1017
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
you can justify almost anything.

1018
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And I'd be like, well, no, I'm not going to be happy

1019
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
if I'm back here, and I'll be a better dad when I get home,

1020
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
and I'll be, you know, I'm showing my kids,

1021
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
and when I got a little older, I'd be like, well,

1022
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I'm showing my, I'm an example for my kids

1023
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
and showing them what hard work can lead to.

1024
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I 100% use that.

1025
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I want 100%.

1026
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I matter of fact, I told, I, I, I would tell like other seals,

1027
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
you know, if they would say, get worried about, hey,

1028
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
you know, I'm going on to pull him in again.

1029
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I'd say, listen, man, guys have been going on

1030
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
to employment for thousands of years

1031
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
and leaving their kids at home.

1032
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And that's the example that the kids see.

1033
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
You know, that the dad's going on the employment.

1034
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
By the way, when you went on to employment,

1035
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
back in freaking, whatever, a 500 years ago,

1036
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
your deployment was seven years long.

1037
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Right. You're the employment was five years,

1038
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
you're even World War II.

1039
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
In World War II, you went, you left for war in 1941

1040
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
or 1942, and you came home when it was over.

1041
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yeah.

1042
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
That's some commitment.

1043
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Yeah.

1044
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
So, because guys were, the reason that this would get brought up

1045
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
was guys would get worried about primarily

1046
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
be worried about like their sons.

1047
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Hey, you know, I feel like, you know, I'm leaving my son too much.

1048
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I said, hey, the moms have been raising young warriors

1049
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
for thousands of years.

1050
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Right.

1051
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You don't need to worry about that.

1052
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
They're, they're going to look at you and think,

1053
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
hey, this is what, this is what I'm supposed to do.

1054
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Yeah.

1055
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
So they'll figure it out.

1056
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That sometimes that justification would kind of turn into

1057
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
civilization for be traded.

1058
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
You want a Thursday night after I'd been free to trade it all week or

1059
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
whatever.

1060
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
And the dads have to be gone for the moms to be able to use

1061
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
a way to your dad gets home.

1062
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
True.

1063
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That's how they raise those warriors.

1064
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Speaking of all this, I'm a worker.

1065
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
The truth is, I've always worked really hard because I've never

1066
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
really felt like I had a ton of natural skills or talent.

1067
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
It would feel unnatural for me not to have a regular job.

1068
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I feel like such a life is reserved for someone who's a star.

1069
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And I don't think I got that.

1070
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So I grind it out.

1071
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I grind it out at training and I grind it out at work.

1072
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Not taking a day off as my only edge.

1073
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I can't just say, you know, today I'm going to run.

1074
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I've sacrificed enough.

1075
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
No.

1076
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
That's what everybody does.

1077
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Everybody has an excuse.

1078
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Everybody has a reason.

1079
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You can always come up with a reason not to go after a challenge.

1080
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So I've learned to never care what the excuse is.

1081
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It's never valid.

1082
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
That's my attitude.

1083
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And that's my edge.

1084
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
It's how I've built endurance and foster resiliency.

1085
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
There are no rest days in my schedule.

1086
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And that's is the reason I excel.

1087
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I think it's like no factor.

1088
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
No factor.

1089
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Well, people say like, oh, you take rest days.

1090
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I'm like, life gives you rest days.

1091
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Yeah.

1092
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
You know, you get the freaking broken water.

1093
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Heeter and all of a sudden you're dealing with that.

1094
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Or you know, you get a travel day where it's like, hey,

1095
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I'm going to be traveling at whatever time and then the plane

1096
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
lays over in your near port for four hours in your layover and like,

1097
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
okay, life is going to give you rest days.

1098
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Right.

1099
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I don't take them voluntarily.

1100
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Right.

1101
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Not happening.

1102
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Well, I have a hard time.

1103
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Like even yesterday, you know,

1104
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Rihanna went out and Evan was out skydiving and Andy was out there too.

1105
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And I was, I paid to actually go and I'm like,

1106
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I actually want to go and run.

1107
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
So I did 14 miles here and went up to the top of the hill over here,

1108
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000
ran along the beach and just would rather work instead of skydiving.

1109
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
So I don't know.

1110
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Maybe I missed out on something, but it's, I just don't,

1111
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I feel better.

1112
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I don't know.

1113
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I just don't feel good unless I've sacrificed.

1114
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
You know, sweated, worked.

1115
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So I can go to bed at night and be like, well,

1116
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
got it done today.

1117
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Yeah, we just had a guy on the podcast named Andrew Huberman and he's a

1118
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
neuroscientist.

1119
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Oh, I love him.

1120
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Yeah.

1121
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
He's a stud.

1122
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
But he, one of the things that he was one of the points he was making is that

1123
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
free dopamine.

1124
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Dopeamine that you don't earn is like the worst thing in the world.

1125
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So dopamine that you get from your, from your phone.

1126
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Yeah.

1127
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Dopamine that you get from a chocolate chip cookie.

1128
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Dopamine that you get that you didn't have to earn is like the worst thing in the world.

1129
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And that's probably what you feel.

1130
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Is you probably feel like if you don't earn that dopamine,

1131
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
it doesn't feel right.

1132
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Yeah, I mean,

1133
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
and people always say over train or you've heard all the sleep.

1134
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Saying people love talking about or getting enough sleep.

1135
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And I don't know.

1136
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I just, I just don't, I don't care about any of that.

1137
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I mean, I'm going to train every day.

1138
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I'm probably not going to get enough sleep.

1139
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
But it's like that, that is the only edge.

1140
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Yeah, just to to sacrifice more.

1141
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Yeah.

1142
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It's the only reason why anybody knows who I am.

1143
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Hard work.

1144
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
By the way, this whole time you're writing for for bow hunting magazines,

1145
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
local magazines, you get rejected.

1146
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
You get rejected by bow hunter magazine.

1147
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
You write about that there, which is, I mean, that's what happens, right?

1148
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Yeah.

1149
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
That's what happens.

1150
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Then you say, I decided to write my first book, bow hunting trophy blacktail.

1151
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
There was never any grand plan one day.

1152
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I decided I wanted to write a book and I wanted to be badass.

1153
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Hard back full cover.

1154
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000
So you do that.

1155
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And you have to borrow a bunch of money to get the thing published.

1156
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Yeah.

1157
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
It's like 50 grand.

1158
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Yeah, it was 50,000.

1159
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
No, because the book was like over $10 each because it was full color,

1160
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
full glossy paper.

1161
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I didn't know anything about anything.

1162
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So made 5,000 of them, 50,000 bucks.

1163
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I had like maybe $200 of it.

1164
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
So I borrowed, I think, 15,000 from my grandma, 10,000 from my other,

1165
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
from my in-laws, my mom, I think, 15.

1166
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Anyway, what year was that?

1167
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
That was 99.

1168
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
So like the internet has been around yet.

1169
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
You can't even sell this thing on the internet, really.

1170
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
No, no.

1171
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
You need to have a magazine.

1172
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
How long were those freaking boxes of books sitting around the house for four years?

1173
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I mean, we moved them a couple times.

1174
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I had a whole spare bedroom filled.

1175
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Because it's at 5,000 books and they're at heavy too.

1176
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Yeah, that is not fun.

1177
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
No, and it took, you know, I and your wife's like, dude, I know.

1178
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
You spent 50 grand.

1179
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Now we got one less room in our house.

1180
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I know.

1181
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It was like, it was not pencil and out of this is a business plan.

1182
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Hey, what's your business plan?

1183
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I never did that one time.

1184
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Until they said, well, here's what you owe us.

1185
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So I'm like, no, I'm writing a book.

1186
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I don't, I will self-publish it because nobody said the market's not big enough.

1187
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Because it's just blacktailed deer, which is just on the west coast.

1188
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Okay, we're gonna wash and California and BC.

1189
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And so yeah, it took forever just to even make that money back.

1190
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But I paid everybody back.

1191
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Took a while.

1192
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Where'd you sell the books for?

1193
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I think like 20 bucks?

1194
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I think 25.

1195
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Okay.

1196
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Yeah.

1197
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And then five shipping. So it was like maybe 29.95.

1198
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
That's everything.

1199
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Yeah.

1200
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Packing them up yourself.

1201
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Yeah.

1202
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
How and yeah.

1203
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Yeah.

1204
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
It was a, yeah.

1205
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
One thing that's awesome about this story, though, is I mean, your story your life is that you two,

1206
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
it just took something that you love to do.

1207
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
And just for all in.

1208
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Like that's what that's what you're doing.

1209
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yeah.

1210
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
And that's, I mean, I don't, I don't know.

1211
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I don't know how it's worked like this, but it's just been my journey.

1212
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
But like I've never been like, why want to meet Tiger Woods?

1213
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
So I'm going to try to golf.

1214
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
You know what I mean?

1215
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It's like everything I've done.

1216
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I've met a lot of amazing people.

1217
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Only through what I do.

1218
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
It's never been like just to meet these.

1219
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So I've been able to train with the limpians and do all this thing.

1220
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Just because it's like, no, they're helping.

1221
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
You know, I care about this to build endurance.

1222
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So I'm going to run with the Olympian to see what I can learn from them or to train with these,

1223
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:04.000
these biggest badasses or to lift weights with these studs, you know, Mark Bell.

1224
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I can have those chances to interact just through my thing.

1225
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'm not, I haven't changed anything that I do.

1226
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
It's just what I do.

1227
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000
But it's staying true to, I'm a bow hunter on my Instagram bio just says bow hunter.

1228
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And because of that, I've met, I'm sitting here with you guys.

1229
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I'm in a, how incredible is that?

1230
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I mean, it just is seem real.

1231
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
That's what I think is the same thing over here.

1232
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Probably, this is free.

1233
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
You did, and eventually you got in a bow hunter.

1234
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And you first, your first thing that you wrote,

1235
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
this is in 2009 was called bleed.

1236
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Yeah. Hell yeah.

1237
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Now we get into this little section of life.

1238
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I'm going to fast forward.

1239
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I started running just for the test to push myself up to 2000.

1240
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Most I'd ever run was a 10k, then one time I entered a 7.3 mile race in Salem, Oregon.

1241
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And guys thought I was crazy for running that far just to get in shape to hunt.

1242
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
The black tail woods around home.

1243
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Then around a half marathon, then in 2003, I ran my first marathon and finished third overall.

1244
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Your first marathon, you finished third overall.

1245
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
That's freaking legit.

1246
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
This was about the time I really began to notice that my physical condition could pay.

1247
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
A huge impact, counting in the woods.

1248
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
This was where I could improve my game.

1249
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Hmm.

1250
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And it wasn't like that was a Boston marathon I got third in.

1251
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
It was like a pretty small marathon in the Gorge.

1252
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000
So it's from the Dallas to Hood River, but I did get third still.

1253
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Yeah.

1254
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Hell yeah.

1255
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Since that first marathon, I've completed in Ultra Marathons, winning Peek Shaped.

1256
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I just prior to BoC's and I run at least 20 miles a day.

1257
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I've ramped it up in effort to gain not only physical up mental strength,

1258
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
and it's paid off in many years of consistent success.

1259
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000
You could do the big horn trail run.

1260
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000
That's your first Ultra, which Ultra is anything over 26.2.

1261
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Yeah.

1262
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
You got this for your yeah, even right in your whole life kind of as it shows in this book.

1263
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Awesome stories.

1264
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
You say I led the race until mile 24 or 25.

1265
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
The problem was the race didn't end at mile 24 or 25.

1266
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Yeah.

1267
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
32 mile.

1268
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I finished second overall with a time of four hours and 53 seconds.

1269
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
It was a great day to be alive.

1270
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Almost all the races I run at some time or another.

1271
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I want to stop and throw in the towel similarly on many tough horns.

1272
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I want to quit and go home to the good life.

1273
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
So why don't I quit?

1274
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
What resides in me to keep going?

1275
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Maybe it's because I don't want to let people down because I'm a regular guy coming

1276
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000
from a small, a regular small town who dare to dream big about being special and finding some success in life.

1277
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Maybe I've always felt like proving people wrong.

1278
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000
As I started running marathons, I realized the connection between endurance racing and hunting.

1279
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Because in both disciplines, you're facing huge barriers that make you want to quit.

1280
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
No one's going to judge if you quit a hunt.

1281
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Most people would fail on a hunt.

1282
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
The same goes for an ultra marathon.

1283
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Not many could call you a failure if you didn't last to the finish of a long ultra.

1284
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Because most people, you know likely, wouldn't even tow the starting line.

1285
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:28.000
But to me, failure feels like all those people who've doubted me over the years were right.

1286
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I can't have that.

1287
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And now you've got the full on connection between the better shape I'm in, the better I can hunt.

1288
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Yeah, it's, I just, I mean, I noticed that I was just at, I had a big advantage over people.

1289
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I could see people get fatigued if I was with somebody.

1290
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I could just, it was just different.

1291
01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And I'm like, I learned that if the hardest thing you've ever done is that hunt, that's bad.

1292
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
It's not good. You're going to, because you're going to, you'll fuck up so much.

1293
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
You have to be on such, I mean, precision and making good decisions.

1294
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
It's, you have to be at your very best.

1295
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000
So if you're fatigued or if you're thinking about home or of all these different things,

1296
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
it's taken away from where your focus should be, you will fail.

1297
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And I just, I noticed that, or I realized I need to be at my very best, even at the end of a long hunt.

1298
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And how it made sense to me was that at the end of a long hunt, instead of being diminished,

1299
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
you should be better because you're getting more dialed into the mountains.

1300
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
You're understanding the animals and their habits.

1301
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
You're getting more mountain tough.

1302
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And so if you weren't fatigued or have any of those things with, with, with time that comes in the mountains,

1303
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
like the, where's on people? If that wasn't wearing on you?

1304
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
By the end of the hunt, you're going to be at your very best.

1305
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And I killed a lot of animals at the very end of the hunt.

1306
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:07.000
So, at one point, the Oregonian newspaper ran an article,

1307
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
and the headline reads,

1308
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Bo Hunter beats Armstrong.

1309
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yeah, tell us that story.

1310
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It's in the book, but give us a, give us a background on that one.

1311
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Yeah, I mean, I knew so Lance was retiring from the Tour de France,

1312
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
and he had won seven straight.

1313
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
It's that next year was, let me think.

1314
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I think that was in 2006. He ran the New York marathon.

1315
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And I'd been a big, big, Lance fan.

1316
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You know, this is what, before all the, whatever people want to say about PDs and all that.

1317
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
It's before all that. So he was just like had overcome this,

1318
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
and he was like a hero. He's still somebody I look up to,

1319
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
because he was the best, the very best of what he did.

1320
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
So he's running this marathon, the New York marathon,

1321
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
and it's my first year running it.

1322
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
It's kind of hard to get into. It's a big race.

1323
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And so I thought, well, I want to try to be the greatest endurance athlete of all time.

1324
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And so I ended up, I beat him there.

1325
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
It was in 2006, and then we ran together, actually,

1326
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
for half the race in Boston in 2008, and I beat him there, too.

1327
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Of course, it was like a one person, he didn't even know who I was.

1328
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
So it wasn't like this is Kim Verselands head to head.

1329
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
He was, you know, he is a superstar.

1330
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I was just something dude.

1331
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
You know, it's like if LeBron James goes to open gym and somebody,

1332
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
you know, somehow travels and gets some hook shot to go in.

1333
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
They dominate in LeBron.

1334
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
So it's kind of like that. He didn't know.

1335
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
It's like beating someone at open mat,

1336
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
or you're like someone passes your guard, open mat,

1337
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
they're like, hey, you know, I crush chocolate past this car.

1338
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Yeah, I even know that we were, you know,

1339
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
all of us have to have fun with Roman.

1340
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Right. So it, so I always the guy who passed your guard.

1341
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
It lands with you.

1342
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And it somehow it makes the cover of the Oregon.

1343
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I know, your jockels guard gets past my phone.

1344
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Exactly.

1345
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000
It was so unjustified, but it's, I just, all I cared about was there

1346
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
is that it just referred to me as bow hunter.

1347
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Yeah, that's badass.

1348
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
But it reminds me of, you know, and everybody, everybody loves

1349
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
a movie 300, but you remember what he was like,

1350
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
we know what's your professional,

1351
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
it's your professional, it's such a great part.

1352
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And then so I don't have a, that's what I do is bow hunter.

1353
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
No, did you talk to him during those two races?

1354
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Didn't one of you ran with him for a while?

1355
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Yeah, you were like talking, right?

1356
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Right. Yeah, yeah.

1357
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Who knows if he'll remember?

1358
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I think we did sit in a book though.

1359
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
But, but, oh, I was going to say, sir,

1360
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
you're not connected now.

1361
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So, so, to do his podcast.

1362
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Okay, well, we've never talked about this.

1363
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Yeah.

1364
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Like me, he and I, but he's gonna make

1365
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I let you win.

1366
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I don't know, he'll be like, what?

1367
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I don't know who you are.

1368
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
But what I remember, this could be a version.

1369
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
You know how you can, you tell us something,

1370
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
a story to yourself so many times.

1371
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
It's like, it becomes, it never happened,

1372
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
but it's like now it's like, I remember Roy told me this one

1373
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
time, he's like, we went on this moose hunt.

1374
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And I've been like, yeah, I've never had actually never had a

1375
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
shot at a moose.

1376
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And he's like, you, you blew it on a giant bull.

1377
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And I'm like, when?

1378
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
He goes, remember on the river and the pouring rain?

1379
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And you hit low on that giant bull on the other side of the river?

1380
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
And I was like, oh my god.

1381
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I had totally blocked that out of my memory.

1382
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I had, I had made this truth in my head

1383
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
that I'd never shot at a moose.

1384
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
No, I just didn't want to remember when I blew it.

1385
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I had definitely shot it on a moose.

1386
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
So anyway, who knows if this last story is kind of like this?

1387
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
But all I know is, we were running and I was running behind him.

1388
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
And I was hurting this dying, like, third, my old 13 of the race.

1389
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
And I remember, it was behind him, he had this gold single

1390
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and on, like, he always wore, because like, I called it the tour.

1391
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And I was looking at his calves and I was like,

1392
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
God, he's probably just feels strong.

1393
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
He's not tired at all enough fatigue.

1394
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And I was like, god, why can't I be an Olympic athlete?

1395
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You know, he made the Olympics too.

1396
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And I just thought he was probably just fresh as can be.

1397
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And I'm just this fucking 40 year old dad dying.

1398
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And I get up, I'm like, I'm going to go.

1399
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
I don't care how bad this hurts.

1400
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I'm just, you know, burst into flames,

1401
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
puke, throw up, collapse, who knows what's going to happen.

1402
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
So I fight, fight, fight, takes me in a while and I get up beside him.

1403
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
So we're running side by side.

1404
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
And he goes, he looks over, probably because I was staring at him.

1405
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I'm gonna go, maybe I was touching his arm.

1406
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I don't know.

1407
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000
But he goes, he goes, is this heartbreak hill?

1408
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
And I said no, and I said, yeah, I said it's still up here.

1409
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It's like, oh, fuck, I'm dying.

1410
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
And I was just like, oh, I'm dying too.

1411
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
But I didn't know you were dying.

1412
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
So that gave me like a weird boost.

1413
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
You know, this man God is dying.

1414
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
And here, I'm a Raylor man,

1415
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
and I'm dying, so it's like, okay, so we kept going,

1416
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
keep going.

1417
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And he and up saying, hey, what's your pace today?

1418
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And I told him he's like, you met my,

1419
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
who knows if this happened.

1420
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I think it did.

1421
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
But, since you might have run with you,

1422
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
and I'm like, no, it's like, yeah,

1423
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
250.

1424
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So we ran together.

1425
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And yeah, it's like, shared a few words.

1426
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I remember people like,

1427
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
LATS, what, 10,000 times.

1428
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I remember this one guy ran up by him.

1429
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.96
And he's like, he was, I had to stick your

1430
01:38:31.96 --> 01:38:32.96
hands or two.

1431
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:37.96
LATS is like, I mean, we're running this race.

1432
01:38:37.96 --> 01:38:40.96
And he's like, I don't even know how your social response.

1433
01:38:40.96 --> 01:38:42.96
You know, so it was just a weird,

1434
01:38:42.96 --> 01:38:44.96
but I was right there for all of this.

1435
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:48.96
Anyway, we, I, I, I finished 12 seconds.

1436
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:51.96
I think or something ahead of him in that race.

1437
01:38:51.96 --> 01:38:52.96
But we had this connection.

1438
01:38:52.96 --> 01:38:53.96
Yeah.

1439
01:38:53.96 --> 01:38:54.96
So so much of,

1440
01:38:54.96 --> 01:38:57.96
the older is why I'm maybe going to make it out.

1441
01:38:57.96 --> 01:39:00.96
So even though we're saying that it was the race

1442
01:39:00.96 --> 01:39:03.96
between you and him, but it was really only in your mind.

1443
01:39:03.96 --> 01:39:04.96
Yeah.

1444
01:39:04.96 --> 01:39:07.96
When someone starts pulling ahead of you in a run,

1445
01:39:07.96 --> 01:39:08.96
that's a thing.

1446
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:09.96
Right.

1447
01:39:09.96 --> 01:39:13.96
So like, at some point, you had to start pulling ahead of it, right?

1448
01:39:13.96 --> 01:39:14.96
Yeah.

1449
01:39:14.96 --> 01:39:17.96
I mean, he had this, there's a motorcade around him.

1450
01:39:17.96 --> 01:39:19.96
Because the, the, the, the,

1451
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:20.96
he leads finished.

1452
01:39:20.96 --> 01:39:25.96
Probably two, maybe 10 to 8 to 08.

1453
01:39:25.96 --> 01:39:27.96
And we were back at 250.

1454
01:39:27.96 --> 01:39:30.96
So, um, they had finished.

1455
01:39:30.96 --> 01:39:32.96
So then the story for the TV was Lance.

1456
01:39:32.96 --> 01:39:34.96
Because Lance was running Boston.

1457
01:39:34.96 --> 01:39:38.96
So there's like this motorcycle and had a camera on it and all the stuff.

1458
01:39:38.96 --> 01:39:42.96
And so yeah, there's some overhead shots and, and we were on TV.

1459
01:39:42.96 --> 01:39:45.96
And my wife, you know, I had told my boys, this is in the book too,

1460
01:39:45.96 --> 01:39:49.96
but I told my boys that, hey, I'm going to go to Boston and,

1461
01:39:49.96 --> 01:39:52.96
and, uh, I'm going to beat Lance Armstrong in the race.

1462
01:39:52.96 --> 01:39:54.96
Again, he last doesn't know anything about me.

1463
01:39:54.96 --> 01:39:58.96
But anyway, they thought I was like, you know, just talking out my ass.

1464
01:39:58.96 --> 01:40:01.96
They were, they were laugh and you can't beat Lance Armstrong.

1465
01:40:01.96 --> 01:40:04.96
Because they'd been a little oxygen in the TV forever.

1466
01:40:04.96 --> 01:40:08.96
And he was such a legend in the, in the tour, you know, he just, you know,

1467
01:40:08.96 --> 01:40:12.96
cocky and blew by people and just dominate and rubbed in their face.

1468
01:40:12.96 --> 01:40:17.96
And he's like, so it was like, you know, he had this, this thing about him.

1469
01:40:17.96 --> 01:40:19.96
And, and this aura.

1470
01:40:19.96 --> 01:40:23.96
So I said I was going to go back to run with him and then beat him at the end.

1471
01:40:23.96 --> 01:40:25.96
They laughed.

1472
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:29.96
And so then on TV, I'm running with Lance Armstrong.

1473
01:40:29.96 --> 01:40:32.96
I have this camo top on that I cut the sleeves off of.

1474
01:40:32.96 --> 01:40:34.96
He's got always Nike gear.

1475
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:36.96
And there I am.

1476
01:40:36.96 --> 01:40:37.96
And we're running.

1477
01:40:37.96 --> 01:40:40.96
And then so at the end of my quote, I told myself, I'm not going to

1478
01:40:40.96 --> 01:40:43.96
fucking run this whole way and not do what I said.

1479
01:40:43.96 --> 01:40:48.96
So I took off and it came across and for he had his own finish line.

1480
01:40:48.96 --> 01:40:51.96
So he had to go up, veer over to the right.

1481
01:40:51.96 --> 01:40:55.96
But there's why I think maybe I didn't make all of it up.

1482
01:40:55.96 --> 01:40:58.96
100% was because he finished and then he pointed at me.

1483
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:03.96
I like I went over there and and we shook hands and said, you know,

1484
01:41:03.96 --> 01:41:04.96
good job.

1485
01:41:04.96 --> 01:41:06.96
So we had a heat whatever.

1486
01:41:06.96 --> 01:41:08.96
And they got a picture.

1487
01:41:08.96 --> 01:41:09.96
I can't remember if it's in the book or not.

1488
01:41:09.96 --> 01:41:14.96
But yeah, so I mean, it was for me.

1489
01:41:14.96 --> 01:41:19.96
Dude, that was, that was, that felt like I was almost athletic.

1490
01:41:19.96 --> 01:41:24.96
You know, that time I was like, this is this, it would be like winning a gold medal.

1491
01:41:24.96 --> 01:41:25.96
I thought.

1492
01:41:25.96 --> 01:41:30.96
So it was and you've got home and your kids were you told your kids.

1493
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:31.96
Like, they saw it.

1494
01:41:31.96 --> 01:41:32.96
No, they saw it.

1495
01:41:32.96 --> 01:41:33.96
They saw it.

1496
01:41:33.96 --> 01:41:33.96
They were a lot.

1497
01:41:33.96 --> 01:41:34.96
Well, true was at home.

1498
01:41:34.96 --> 01:41:35.96
He's watching.

1499
01:41:35.96 --> 01:41:37.96
And then here's how big a deal lasts.

1500
01:41:37.96 --> 01:41:41.96
It's time they announced it on the school intercom that Tanner and

1501
01:41:41.96 --> 01:41:46.96
true is dad beat Lance Armstrong in the Boston Maritime.

1502
01:41:46.96 --> 01:41:51.96
So, you know, Eugene is known as a running capital of the world.

1503
01:41:51.96 --> 01:41:54.96
You know, we had the Olympic, the Olympic trials there all the time.

1504
01:41:54.96 --> 01:41:56.96
So running is kind of a big thing there.

1505
01:41:56.96 --> 01:41:59.96
So to have and everybody knows Boston, everybody knows Lance.

1506
01:41:59.96 --> 01:42:02.96
So it's like his perfect storm.

1507
01:42:02.96 --> 01:42:04.96
But for me, it was after.

1508
01:42:04.96 --> 01:42:06.96
Where do you record him with him?

1509
01:42:06.96 --> 01:42:07.96
I don't know.

1510
01:42:07.96 --> 01:42:08.96
We have to schedule it.

1511
01:42:08.96 --> 01:42:09.96
Okay.

1512
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:11.96
So I was going to say if you get this podcast out.

1513
01:42:11.96 --> 01:42:13.96
Hopefully you won't hear this one before he gets you.

1514
01:42:13.96 --> 01:42:17.96
Because otherwise, I don't know.

1515
01:42:17.96 --> 01:42:19.96
You either I'll be ready for you.

1516
01:42:19.96 --> 01:42:20.96
I know.

1517
01:42:20.96 --> 01:42:21.96
He'll be like, no.

1518
01:42:21.96 --> 01:42:22.96
Yeah.

1519
01:42:22.96 --> 01:42:23.96
That did not happen.

1520
01:42:23.96 --> 01:42:24.96
I.

1521
01:42:24.96 --> 01:42:27.96
All right.

1522
01:42:27.96 --> 01:42:29.96
So speaking of running.

1523
01:42:29.96 --> 01:42:35.96
Here we go with over 17,000 feet of elevation gain.

1524
01:42:35.96 --> 01:42:40.96
The big horn 100 was one of the toughest 100 mile foot races in the United States.

1525
01:42:40.96 --> 01:42:42.96
It would be my first ultra over 50 miles.

1526
01:42:42.96 --> 01:42:46.96
The previous year at the big horn 50, I finished third overall.

1527
01:42:46.96 --> 01:42:51.96
It would be my first race where I would be required to run through the night.

1528
01:42:51.96 --> 01:42:56.96
My wife was having second thoughts and tried to persuade me to reconsider.

1529
01:42:56.96 --> 01:42:58.96
You said I've already done a 50 mile.

1530
01:42:58.96 --> 01:43:05.96
And my goal is to find out exactly what I can do to find where's my breaking point.

1531
01:43:05.96 --> 01:43:08.96
So at this point, you've done some 50 miles.

1532
01:43:08.96 --> 01:43:10.96
And now you're going for the hundo.

1533
01:43:10.96 --> 01:43:17.96
Yeah, because in the ultra marathon world, it's until you do a hundred.

1534
01:43:17.96 --> 01:43:19.96
It doesn't even.

1535
01:43:19.96 --> 01:43:20.96
It's like, I don't know.

1536
01:43:20.96 --> 01:43:22.96
They don't even really count it.

1537
01:43:22.96 --> 01:43:26.96
You know, like the 50 K, which is 32 miles or the 50 mile.

1538
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:28.96
It's like, well, have you done a hundred yet?

1539
01:43:28.96 --> 01:43:31.96
So that's like the barrier of entry for the old.

1540
01:43:31.96 --> 01:43:32.96
Yeah.

1541
01:43:32.96 --> 01:43:33.96
And I had.

1542
01:43:33.96 --> 01:43:35.96
So that was my first one.

1543
01:43:35.96 --> 01:43:40.92
And you say the big one 100 is an out and back run consisting of 76 miles of single track

1544
01:43:40.92 --> 01:43:47.92
and 60 miles of rugged double track cheap trail and eight miles of gravel road with 17,500 feet of climbing,

1545
01:43:47.92 --> 01:43:49.92
18,000 feet of descent.

1546
01:43:49.92 --> 01:43:51.92
So I looked at the map of this.

1547
01:43:51.92 --> 01:43:52.92
I went online.

1548
01:43:52.92 --> 01:43:54.92
It looked like.

1549
01:43:54.92 --> 01:43:58.92
So it sort of looks like you're going up and down mountains the whole time.

1550
01:43:58.92 --> 01:44:00.92
Are you going on a ridge line or something?

1551
01:44:00.92 --> 01:44:01.92
But what is it?

1552
01:44:01.92 --> 01:44:02.92
Are you an out of mountains?

1553
01:44:02.92 --> 01:44:04.92
No, you're.

1554
01:44:04.92 --> 01:44:05.92
So it starts.

1555
01:44:05.92 --> 01:44:07.92
You start pretty high.

1556
01:44:07.92 --> 01:44:14.92
And then you go, you go up to the 9,000 feet, then you stay on the ridge, then you drop all the way down to maybe 6,000 feet.

1557
01:44:14.92 --> 01:44:18.92
And then you climb back at the 48 mile mark as a turnaround.

1558
01:44:18.92 --> 01:44:24.92
And that climbs from 6,000 back up to about almost 10,000 probably 9 something.

1559
01:44:24.92 --> 01:44:27.92
Let's a gradual climb up and then you reverse and come back.

1560
01:44:27.92 --> 01:44:29.92
That's what struck me.

1561
01:44:29.92 --> 01:44:35.92
It's very sucky when I looked at it because I was like, oh, you know, it kind of looks like,

1562
01:44:35.92 --> 01:44:37.92
because they have a profile shot.

1563
01:44:37.92 --> 01:44:38.92
Yeah.

1564
01:44:38.92 --> 01:44:39.92
And they kind of just show you the elevation.

1565
01:44:39.92 --> 01:44:40.92
And it's up down.

1566
01:44:40.92 --> 01:44:43.92
It's basically up down up down up down down down down down down kind of descending.

1567
01:44:43.92 --> 01:44:44.92
Right.

1568
01:44:44.92 --> 01:44:45.92
Up down up down up.

1569
01:44:45.92 --> 01:44:46.92
You're kind of slowly descending.

1570
01:44:46.92 --> 01:44:50.92
And then I read your book and I was like, oh, and there's a turn around.

1571
01:44:50.92 --> 01:44:52.92
So you go up down up down up down up down up down up down up down.

1572
01:44:52.92 --> 01:44:53.92
And you're kind of descending.

1573
01:44:53.92 --> 01:44:55.92
And then it's up down up down up down up.

1574
01:44:55.92 --> 01:44:56.92
But going back up.

1575
01:44:56.92 --> 01:45:04.92
Yeah, that there's a grind from I remember this specifically from I think 60 something to 82.

1576
01:45:04.92 --> 01:45:07.92
And so hard.

1577
01:45:07.92 --> 01:45:11.92
It was so just it was up the whole way and it started to get hot.

1578
01:45:11.92 --> 01:45:14.92
And it's like you've been running all night.

1579
01:45:14.92 --> 01:45:18.92
And you said, even 20 miles into it, you borrowed a camel back from somebody.

1580
01:45:18.92 --> 01:45:20.92
You got that thing wearing holes into your back.

1581
01:45:20.92 --> 01:45:21.92
It did.

1582
01:45:21.92 --> 01:45:22.92
It.

1583
01:45:22.92 --> 01:45:24.92
I never trained with it.

1584
01:45:24.92 --> 01:45:26.92
And you went out of the gate like pre-fond team.

1585
01:45:26.92 --> 01:45:27.92
Just go out.

1586
01:45:27.92 --> 01:45:28.92
And hard as a good.

1587
01:45:28.92 --> 01:45:31.92
What else is like the 800 meter back in middle school?

1588
01:45:31.92 --> 01:45:34.92
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

1589
01:45:34.92 --> 01:45:37.92
And I thought I was going to get it the turn around quicker.

1590
01:45:37.92 --> 01:45:41.92
So I didn't have a headlamp because I thought it was going to be there.

1591
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:42.92
I had my head.

1592
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:43.92
Here's what I'm going to do.

1593
01:45:43.92 --> 01:45:46.92
I'll get here at, you know, whatever it right when it's starting to get dark.

1594
01:45:46.92 --> 01:45:48.92
But I didn't get there till about 11.

1595
01:45:48.92 --> 01:45:50.92
12 hours into the race.

1596
01:45:50.92 --> 01:45:51.92
And so it'd been dark for a couple hours.

1597
01:45:51.92 --> 01:45:53.92
So I'm up in the snow.

1598
01:45:53.92 --> 01:45:55.92
There's snow up there at the turn around.

1599
01:45:55.92 --> 01:45:58.92
And pulse tolling through the snow with no light.

1600
01:45:58.92 --> 01:46:01.92
And I get to the turn around and I'm like, oh my God.

1601
01:46:01.92 --> 01:46:03.92
This is brutal.

1602
01:46:03.92 --> 01:46:04.92
So that was my first one.

1603
01:46:04.92 --> 01:46:07.92
That is 48 miles down at 52 left.

1604
01:46:07.92 --> 01:46:10.92
You say in here that that 48 miles turn around.

1605
01:46:10.92 --> 01:46:15.92
The porcupine aid station is real convenient spot for DNFers.

1606
01:46:15.92 --> 01:46:19.92
That was the official notation on the race results for runners who quit.

1607
01:46:19.92 --> 01:46:22.92
DNF did not finish.

1608
01:46:22.92 --> 01:46:24.92
I saw guys at porcupine.

1609
01:46:24.92 --> 01:46:25.92
Tough guys, obviously.

1610
01:46:25.92 --> 01:46:26.92
I mean, hell, to get there.

1611
01:46:26.92 --> 01:46:32.92
They just ran 48 miles to the last 18 uphill to the tune of a 4500 foot gain.

1612
01:46:32.92 --> 01:46:34.92
Looking like they were on their deathbed.

1613
01:46:34.92 --> 01:46:37.92
Raptain Blankets being attended by Medix.

1614
01:46:37.92 --> 01:46:41.92
It was at porcupine that many called it a race.

1615
01:46:41.92 --> 01:46:46.92
Yes, he having been in the military for a long time.

1616
01:46:46.92 --> 01:46:48.92
Or I was in the military for a long time.

1617
01:46:48.92 --> 01:46:51.92
And we would be going out on patrols.

1618
01:46:51.92 --> 01:46:55.92
And you pay really close attention to how much elevation you're doing.

1619
01:46:55.92 --> 01:46:57.92
You're going to gain or lose.

1620
01:46:57.92 --> 01:46:59.92
You know, you're doing a map study.

1621
01:46:59.92 --> 01:47:00.92
You're looking at the contour lines.

1622
01:47:00.92 --> 01:47:01.92
Like you're figuring out.

1623
01:47:01.92 --> 01:47:07.92
So when you say 4500 feet gain or a total of 18,000.

1624
01:47:07.92 --> 01:47:09.92
That's a socks.

1625
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:10.92
Yeah.

1626
01:47:10.92 --> 01:47:12.92
And that's what makes.

1627
01:47:12.92 --> 01:47:13.92
It's not just the distance.

1628
01:47:13.92 --> 01:47:14.92
It's a terrain too.

1629
01:47:14.92 --> 01:47:18.92
And on trail also your body's like correcting all the time.

1630
01:47:18.92 --> 01:47:22.92
You know, like on road, you'll see some elite marathoners.

1631
01:47:22.92 --> 01:47:23.92
And they don't even have abs.

1632
01:47:23.92 --> 01:47:27.92
You know, they kind of almost got a little pot belly because you can get so efficient

1633
01:47:27.92 --> 01:47:29.92
at running on a road.

1634
01:47:29.92 --> 01:47:34.92
In the mountains, you are correcting all your cores like getting taxed.

1635
01:47:34.92 --> 01:47:37.92
Your quasi-gating tax is a whole different type of running.

1636
01:47:37.92 --> 01:47:39.92
But it's taxing.

1637
01:47:39.92 --> 01:47:41.92
What are you carrying on you?

1638
01:47:41.92 --> 01:47:43.92
You got to take some water.

1639
01:47:43.92 --> 01:47:44.92
Usually in some calories.

1640
01:47:44.92 --> 01:47:45.92
So that's it.

1641
01:47:45.92 --> 01:47:46.92
Yeah.

1642
01:47:46.92 --> 01:47:53.92
You get to, you were trying to do it in how long?

1643
01:47:53.92 --> 01:47:54.92
24 hours?

1644
01:47:54.92 --> 01:47:55.92
Yeah.

1645
01:47:55.92 --> 01:47:58.92
That's always the goal if you can break 24 hours and a hundred by

1646
01:47:58.92 --> 01:48:00.92
or you're slid you it.

1647
01:48:00.92 --> 01:48:01.92
You're legit.

1648
01:48:01.92 --> 01:48:05.92
At 12 p.m., I topped out at mile 82.

1649
01:48:05.92 --> 01:48:07.92
How is that 25 hours now?

1650
01:48:07.92 --> 01:48:10.92
It's not under 24.

1651
01:48:10.92 --> 01:48:12.92
And I still had 18 miles.

1652
01:48:12.92 --> 01:48:13.92
Let's do it.

1653
01:48:13.92 --> 01:48:18.92
By 3.10 p.m., I reached the last state station in mile 95.

1654
01:48:18.92 --> 01:48:23.92
When I got to mile 95, Tanner was there waiting for me and ran the last five

1655
01:48:23.92 --> 01:48:24.92
with his old man.

1656
01:48:24.92 --> 01:48:28.92
That boy, I told him I couldn't stop because of my knee.

1657
01:48:28.92 --> 01:48:33.92
And to said, we had an hour and 50 minutes to run five miles.

1658
01:48:33.92 --> 01:48:36.92
Yeah, I wanted to definitely want to get in under 30 hours.

1659
01:48:36.92 --> 01:48:37.92
Right.

1660
01:48:37.92 --> 01:48:38.92
But 29.

1661
01:48:38.92 --> 01:48:42.92
And was Tanner just like, I mean, you can run, you can run five miles in 30 minutes.

1662
01:48:42.92 --> 01:48:46.92
Yeah, I mean, he was I think 14 at the time.

1663
01:48:46.92 --> 01:48:50.92
And I kind of took him just kind of, you know, how we talked about

1664
01:48:50.92 --> 01:48:51.92
we always turned it justify.

1665
01:48:51.92 --> 01:48:53.92
And so I'm like, well, my son's there.

1666
01:48:53.92 --> 01:48:56.92
It's like I'm not really himself.

1667
01:48:56.92 --> 01:49:02.92
So he had to stay in the hotel by himself for a whole day, 29 hours.

1668
01:49:02.92 --> 01:49:06.92
I had someone to give him a ride to that aid station to go to the last five.

1669
01:49:06.92 --> 01:49:09.92
And he didn't really want to do five.

1670
01:49:09.92 --> 01:49:14.92
So, but I was going pretty slow at that time.

1671
01:49:14.92 --> 01:49:20.92
At 420 p.m. a hundred miles, we're in the books official time 29 hours, 20 minutes.

1672
01:49:20.92 --> 01:49:23.92
I was a hundred mile ultra marathoner.

1673
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:26.92
I earned my first hundred mile belt buckle.

1674
01:49:26.92 --> 01:49:31.92
Yeah, that's what you get instead of a medal or a trophy or anything.

1675
01:49:31.92 --> 01:49:33.92
You did usually have belt buckle.

1676
01:49:33.92 --> 01:49:36.92
Is that just like outwester, is that everywhere?

1677
01:49:36.92 --> 01:49:40.92
Uh, I don't know. Maybe out. I'm not sure.

1678
01:49:40.92 --> 01:49:41.92
Hmm.

1679
01:49:41.92 --> 01:49:43.92
Yeah.

1680
01:49:43.92 --> 01:49:44.92
Check.

1681
01:49:44.92 --> 01:49:46.92
Hundred miles.

1682
01:49:47.92 --> 01:49:50.92
Fast forward a little bit here.

1683
01:49:50.92 --> 01:49:57.92
You say, in the final year of my dad's life, he reminded me once again how much I respected and admired him.

1684
01:49:57.92 --> 01:50:02.92
From the moment doctors discovered a lump on his liver, Bob Haines began his fight with cancer.

1685
01:50:02.92 --> 01:50:06.92
It was an aggressive form of cancer, but he never gave up.

1686
01:50:06.92 --> 01:50:09.92
For 18 months, he waged a war against it.

1687
01:50:09.92 --> 01:50:16.92
I'm going to beat it. He told me, everybody who gets cancer says this and sometimes they do.

1688
01:50:16.92 --> 01:50:23.92
So, your dad comes down with with liver cancer.

1689
01:50:23.92 --> 01:50:29.92
Um, you, you, you talk about that and here and as you're talking about that,

1690
01:50:29.92 --> 01:50:36.92
you still are working your job, you're still being a dad and you're still training and you're still running.

1691
01:50:36.92 --> 01:50:37.92
Hmm.

1692
01:50:37.92 --> 01:50:45.92
Then you have a goal and you say the most coveted award in the Ultraman Marathoning World is the silver buckle awarded

1693
01:50:45.92 --> 01:50:47.92
at the Western States and Durans run.

1694
01:50:47.92 --> 01:50:52.92
It's the most famous 100 mile race in the world because of a history and competitiveness.

1695
01:50:52.92 --> 01:51:00.92
I earned my buckle in my second 100 mile by finishing in under 24 hours at 22 hours and 41 minutes.

1696
01:51:00.92 --> 01:51:11.92
In my world, if there was ever a comparison to an Olympic gold medal, it would be this silver buckle.

1697
01:51:11.92 --> 01:51:13.92
So, you're going to go for this thing.

1698
01:51:13.92 --> 01:51:20.92
On the drive down to where the race started in Olympic Valley, California, I talked to my dad on the phone and he didn't sound good.

1699
01:51:20.92 --> 01:51:24.92
He'd been battling cancer for cancer for a year and a half.

1700
01:51:24.92 --> 01:51:28.92
So, I knew in my heart he was nearing the end of his fight.

1701
01:51:28.92 --> 01:51:37.92
As I ran, I took some solace and knowing he was following my progress live on the WS100.com website.

1702
01:51:37.92 --> 01:51:46.92
At 341 AM, I crossed the finish line in Auburn, California and in doing so earned my silver Western States buckle.

1703
01:51:46.92 --> 01:51:51.92
I just logged in nearly seven hour improvement over my first 100 mile race.

1704
01:51:51.92 --> 01:51:59.92
I started out the race supremely confident during those 22 hours and 41 minutes of reflection while running doubt-crept in more than once.

1705
01:51:59.92 --> 01:52:04.92
Through those struggles, I kept telling myself that my pain was temporary.

1706
01:52:04.92 --> 01:52:08.92
In a few days time, I would be healed up and richer from the experience.

1707
01:52:08.92 --> 01:52:11.92
For my dad, there would be no healing.

1708
01:52:11.92 --> 01:52:20.92
There would be, there would only be deeper and more debilitating pain and sickness than death.

1709
01:52:20.92 --> 01:52:23.92
I finished the race that Sunday morning.

1710
01:52:23.92 --> 01:52:27.92
We drove home that day, getting home very late.

1711
01:52:27.92 --> 01:52:31.92
I went to work the next day.

1712
01:52:31.92 --> 01:52:36.92
I will never forget looking into dad's eyes upon my return from the race and saying, Dad,

1713
01:52:36.92 --> 01:52:44.92
I wish I could give you some of my strength. Don't give up on me yet. He told me.

1714
01:52:44.92 --> 01:52:47.92
He still thought he was going to beat it.

1715
01:52:47.92 --> 01:52:50.92
I will never forget his will to live.

1716
01:52:50.92 --> 01:52:55.92
A handful of days after I earned my silver buckle in the Western States race,

1717
01:52:55.92 --> 01:53:00.92
my dad passed on early in the day on July 5th.

1718
01:53:00.92 --> 01:53:08.92
The pain of losing him was much worse than any had felt before from the race's life or anything.

1719
01:53:08.92 --> 01:53:17.92
I was a bit of a hard time.

1720
01:53:17.92 --> 01:53:35.92
It was like a big transition because on July 4th every year,

1721
01:53:35.92 --> 01:53:39.92
there's the butebutin K and Eugene.

1722
01:53:39.92 --> 01:53:44.92
My dad has how he lived with my stepmom candy pretty close to the course.

1723
01:53:44.92 --> 01:53:51.92
They would walk down to Dairy Mart and we would be doing the 10 K and run by him every time, every year forever.

1724
01:53:51.92 --> 01:53:56.92
I'm running that day, July 4th, 2010.

1725
01:53:56.92 --> 01:54:02.92
The day before he died and I was getting up there by Dairy Mart, no dad.

1726
01:54:02.92 --> 01:54:05.92
He never missed.

1727
01:54:05.92 --> 01:54:12.92
It's like I said, running this so important, the biggest race in Eugene.

1728
01:54:12.92 --> 01:54:21.92
It was, I mean, I knew, but people with cancer, it's always this thing.

1729
01:54:21.92 --> 01:54:26.92
No one quite if you people haven't, everybody's going to beat it and you just know.

1730
01:54:26.92 --> 01:54:32.92
It's heartbreaking because they're not going to beat it.

1731
01:54:32.92 --> 01:54:39.92
The chemo is going to, you know, it can take the chemo so long so the cancer is held back for a while,

1732
01:54:39.92 --> 01:54:44.92
but then once you stop the chemo because your body can't take it, then the cancer comes back.

1733
01:54:44.92 --> 01:54:51.92
Harder and it's like everybody kind of knows the routine, but nobody wants to talk about it.

1734
01:54:51.92 --> 01:55:01.92
But I knew. And so then not seeing him there that day and then he died that early in the morning at July 5th.

1735
01:55:01.92 --> 01:55:11.92
And how did he go over there and, you know, it was just a, you know,

1736
01:55:11.92 --> 01:55:18.92
when somebody dies at the house like he did, you have to have the funeral home or whoever come over.

1737
01:55:18.92 --> 01:55:21.92
So he comes over and he's by himself.

1738
01:55:21.92 --> 01:55:25.92
And my dad's room is upstairs and he's like, I said, how are you?

1739
01:55:25.92 --> 01:55:29.92
How are you getting them down? He's like, well, could you help me?

1740
01:55:29.92 --> 01:55:36.92
And so we had to put him in a bag and had to help carry him out.

1741
01:55:36.92 --> 01:55:45.92
And it's like, I don't know, it's one of those, he's never forget, never forget that.

1742
01:55:45.92 --> 01:55:53.92
And so it's just death, this journey, you know, your dad not being around.

1743
01:55:53.92 --> 01:56:00.92
And it's like, it makes all the other, like I say in there, the physical pain, just seem like nothing to me.

1744
01:56:00.92 --> 01:56:05.92
What did your dad think about the, the freaking hundred mile races?

1745
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:09.92
Because those weren't really around when your dad was running.

1746
01:56:09.92 --> 01:56:14.92
No, he probably, I mean, he would act like he cared,

1747
01:56:14.92 --> 01:56:19.92
but, you know, he was more of a Olympic event person,

1748
01:56:19.92 --> 01:56:23.92
Poverty, high-jump, running.

1749
01:56:23.92 --> 01:56:29.92
You know, the altars are kind of like the kind of a weird offshoot of that, you know.

1750
01:56:29.92 --> 01:56:35.92
So he's probably like, well, for he probably think it was better than Bohani,

1751
01:56:35.92 --> 01:56:40.92
because he'd never hunted, he's just an athlete his whole life, so he would say,

1752
01:56:40.92 --> 01:56:44.92
you know, when I kill an animal, I'd lose brain cells.

1753
01:56:44.92 --> 01:56:50.92
So he was like pretty liberal, South-E-Gee's a pretty liberal school and you gene.

1754
01:56:50.92 --> 01:56:55.92
And he was track coach there forever, so he never got the hunting part,

1755
01:56:55.92 --> 01:57:00.92
but he, you know, so the altars are probably a little better than hunting.

1756
01:57:00.92 --> 01:57:06.92
He gets to celebrate those little more, but still not quite as good as, you know, real track.

1757
01:57:06.92 --> 01:57:11.92
I don't think like dads are ever impressed by anything.

1758
01:57:11.92 --> 01:57:15.92
You know, they're always just like, well, you know.

1759
01:57:15.92 --> 01:57:17.92
That's a tough crowd.

1760
01:57:17.92 --> 01:57:26.92
Yeah, I remember I was a lathe who I wrote extreme ownership with,

1761
01:57:26.92 --> 01:57:29.92
and we made the New York Times bestseller list, right?

1762
01:57:29.92 --> 01:57:34.92
And so I called my parents, I was like, hey, you know,

1763
01:57:34.92 --> 01:57:37.92
and lathe, lathe remembers this because I had him on speaker,

1764
01:57:37.92 --> 01:57:40.92
as I came, I just found out we made the New York Times bestseller list.

1765
01:57:40.92 --> 01:57:45.92
And my mom was like, well, it really, what really counts is how long

1766
01:57:45.92 --> 01:57:47.92
stay on their phone.

1767
01:57:47.92 --> 01:57:50.92
I was like, good boy.

1768
01:57:50.92 --> 01:57:52.92
Yeah, I was like, cool, later.

1769
01:57:52.92 --> 01:57:54.92
Yeah, good boy.

1770
01:57:54.92 --> 01:57:57.92
Yeah, I was like, cool, yeah, my boss, you know.

1771
01:57:57.92 --> 01:57:59.92
Sorry about that.

1772
01:57:59.92 --> 01:58:00.92
Sorry about that.

1773
01:58:00.92 --> 01:58:05.92
Yeah, I just wanted to taste that thing.

1774
01:58:05.92 --> 01:58:06.92
I just wanted to taste that thing.

1775
01:58:06.92 --> 01:58:08.92
I was like, the very bottom of this tasted.

1776
01:58:08.92 --> 01:58:11.92
Dude, one minute, I'm going to go on records saying,

1777
01:58:11.92 --> 01:58:14.92
if your book doesn't, you book out, they'll make it.

1778
01:58:14.92 --> 01:58:18.92
I'm going on record as saying, it will make it.

1779
01:58:18.92 --> 01:58:19.92
It will make it.

1780
01:58:19.92 --> 01:58:23.92
Dude, if the freaking, the tour you're doing right now,

1781
01:58:23.92 --> 01:58:25.92
yeah, it will make it.

1782
01:58:25.92 --> 01:58:26.92
Yeah, it will make it.

1783
01:58:26.92 --> 01:58:27.92
Yeah.

1784
01:58:27.92 --> 01:58:32.92
Yeah, and they're, you know, it's not based on sales.

1785
01:58:32.92 --> 01:58:36.92
It's based on whatever their weird voodoo is.

1786
01:58:36.92 --> 01:58:37.92
Yeah.

1787
01:58:37.92 --> 01:58:39.92
It'd be the upset of the century if it makes it.

1788
01:58:39.92 --> 01:58:42.92
Well, you know, you know, Jordan Peterson's book,

1789
01:58:42.92 --> 01:58:44.92
12 rules for life if you ever heard of that.

1790
01:58:44.92 --> 01:58:47.92
Yeah, it's literally the biggest selling book in the past.

1791
01:58:47.92 --> 01:58:48.92
I don't know how long.

1792
01:58:48.92 --> 01:58:50.92
Yeah, it didn't make it.

1793
01:58:50.92 --> 01:58:55.92
So that is, yeah.

1794
01:58:55.92 --> 01:58:57.92
I don't know.

1795
01:58:57.92 --> 01:58:59.92
Yeah, they got their own little.

1796
01:58:59.92 --> 01:59:01.92
They got their own things they're promoting over there.

1797
01:59:01.92 --> 01:59:02.92
Yeah.

1798
01:59:02.92 --> 01:59:08.92
Anyways, going back to this book, you got a whole section in here on a bunch of people.

1799
01:59:08.92 --> 01:59:10.92
Courtney, how do you say her last name?

1800
01:59:10.92 --> 01:59:11.92
The Walter.

1801
01:59:11.92 --> 01:59:14.92
You got Courtney DeWalter, Michael Chandler,

1802
01:59:14.92 --> 01:59:19.92
Connor McGregor, Connor McGregor, David Goggins.

1803
01:59:19.92 --> 01:59:25.92
You talk about Jordan, Kobe, Brady, Tiger, Steve from Prefonte.

1804
01:59:25.92 --> 01:59:31.92
You just got a bunch of awesome freaking athletes and studs that you talk about,

1805
01:59:31.92 --> 01:59:33.92
kind of what you take away from all of them.

1806
01:59:33.92 --> 01:59:36.92
So that was a pretty cool section.

1807
01:59:36.92 --> 01:59:40.92
And then like you said, you've gotten to meet all these people and

1808
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:41.92
freaking hang out with them.

1809
01:59:41.92 --> 01:59:42.92
Yeah.

1810
01:59:42.92 --> 01:59:43.92
Did you meet Tiger?

1811
01:59:43.92 --> 01:59:44.92
No, no.

1812
01:59:44.92 --> 01:59:46.92
No, and not, I just like their minds.

1813
01:59:46.92 --> 01:59:48.92
Yeah, well, Jordan, Kobe, Brady and

1814
01:59:48.92 --> 01:59:54.92
Oh, they'll you exchange some, like, social media with Brady with Brady.

1815
01:59:54.92 --> 01:59:55.92
Yeah.

1816
01:59:55.92 --> 01:59:59.92
And I have talked to Connor before, but all I ever said to Connor was,

1817
01:59:59.92 --> 02:00:02.92
this is kind of he's on his come up.

1818
02:00:02.92 --> 02:00:04.92
And he was like really taken off.

1819
02:00:04.92 --> 02:00:05.92
And he was sitting there.

1820
02:00:05.92 --> 02:00:07.92
I was, you know, Joe had the hook up for the seats.

1821
02:00:07.92 --> 02:00:10.92
You know, God bless, Joe and UFC.

1822
02:00:10.92 --> 02:00:13.92
But so Connor was sitting there with his girlfriend.

1823
02:00:13.92 --> 02:00:16.92
And I go over there and I just said, I go,

1824
02:00:16.92 --> 02:00:19.92
I said, how have you ever lost?

1825
02:00:19.92 --> 02:00:22.92
Because he had two, he has two had two losses at this time.

1826
02:00:22.92 --> 02:00:23.92
Yeah.

1827
02:00:23.92 --> 02:00:27.92
He was, I think he's cage warriors or whatever over there.

1828
02:00:27.92 --> 02:00:28.92
Yeah.

1829
02:00:28.92 --> 02:00:31.92
And then came up and it was on a pretty good tear in the UFC.

1830
02:00:31.92 --> 02:00:33.92
But I was like, he has two losses.

1831
02:00:33.92 --> 02:00:35.92
And I said, how have you ever lost?

1832
02:00:35.92 --> 02:00:37.92
Because you see him on beatable right now.

1833
02:00:37.92 --> 02:00:41.92
And he's like, well, just young, just wasn't that good.

1834
02:00:41.92 --> 02:00:45.92
So anyway, that was only time I've had a big change towards with him.

1835
02:00:45.92 --> 02:00:50.92
But yeah, I never met Kobe, but I took a lot and Jordan, I have him at him.

1836
02:00:50.92 --> 02:00:55.92
But that mindset, you know, the winning mindset, everybody can take something from those guys.

1837
02:00:55.92 --> 02:00:56.92
Yeah.

1838
02:00:56.92 --> 02:00:59.92
How good was that documentary the last dance?

1839
02:00:59.92 --> 02:01:01.92
Oh my God, I loved it.

1840
02:01:01.92 --> 02:01:02.92
I loved it.

1841
02:01:02.92 --> 02:01:03.92
Yeah.

1842
02:01:03.92 --> 02:01:07.92
Speaking of dads, you know how well, like, dads never listen anything that you say.

1843
02:01:07.92 --> 02:01:08.92
Right.

1844
02:01:08.92 --> 02:01:10.92
So my dad's a sports fanatic.

1845
02:01:10.92 --> 02:01:12.92
A sports fanatic.

1846
02:01:12.92 --> 02:01:15.92
And I go, hey, you should really watch this thing in the last dance.

1847
02:01:15.92 --> 02:01:16.92
I don't know.

1848
02:01:16.92 --> 02:01:21.92
I can't get him to watch it.

1849
02:01:21.92 --> 02:01:23.92
I still have his little watch to.

1850
02:01:23.92 --> 02:01:24.92
He's a one person in the world.

1851
02:01:24.92 --> 02:01:25.92
Yeah.

1852
02:01:25.92 --> 02:01:26.92
He's a one person in the world.

1853
02:01:26.92 --> 02:01:29.92
Who is a basketball fanatic to coach the basketball.

1854
02:01:29.92 --> 02:01:30.92
Back as you brought it up.

1855
02:01:30.92 --> 02:01:32.92
Referee basketball.

1856
02:01:32.92 --> 02:01:41.92
And I said, hey, hey, dad, this is probably like the coolest thing that's ever been made about basketball from a media perspective.

1857
02:01:41.92 --> 02:01:42.92
Yeah.

1858
02:01:42.92 --> 02:01:43.92
You should really watch it.

1859
02:01:43.92 --> 02:01:44.92
You will really enjoy it.

1860
02:01:44.92 --> 02:01:45.92
Yeah.

1861
02:01:45.92 --> 02:01:46.92
You should have told him not to watch it.

1862
02:01:46.92 --> 02:01:49.92
I should have told him it was stupid.

1863
02:01:49.92 --> 02:01:51.92
Yeah.

1864
02:01:51.92 --> 02:01:52.92
Yeah.

1865
02:01:52.92 --> 02:01:53.92
I know.

1866
02:01:53.92 --> 02:01:55.92
They did a such a good job.

1867
02:01:55.92 --> 02:01:57.92
And Jordan's mindset.

1868
02:01:57.92 --> 02:01:58.92
Oh my God.

1869
02:01:58.92 --> 02:02:01.92
How do you know, I love when he's like getting on the guys.

1870
02:02:01.92 --> 02:02:02.92
Oh, yeah.

1871
02:02:02.92 --> 02:02:03.92
Yeah.

1872
02:02:03.92 --> 02:02:04.92
Yeah.

1873
02:02:04.92 --> 02:02:05.92
All those.

1874
02:02:05.92 --> 02:02:06.92
And then the next, see, I grew up.

1875
02:02:06.92 --> 02:02:08.92
And you probably get well, see.

1876
02:02:08.92 --> 02:02:09.92
You're older than me.

1877
02:02:09.92 --> 02:02:14.92
But by the time Jordan's time was here, I was already in the military.

1878
02:02:14.92 --> 02:02:19.92
So I wasn't tracking as hard as I was as I was in the 80s, right?

1879
02:02:19.92 --> 02:02:27.92
When it was, you know, the Celtics and the Lakers and me being from New England, it was like Celtics, 100% all day long.

1880
02:02:27.92 --> 02:02:29.92
And Larry Bird is like a god.

1881
02:02:29.92 --> 02:02:30.92
Oh, yeah.

1882
02:02:30.92 --> 02:02:35.92
And then you have Larry Bird because Larry Bird's attitude is savage, similar.

1883
02:02:35.92 --> 02:02:38.92
And, you know, the thing that they say about Bird,

1884
02:02:38.92 --> 02:02:40.92
and they say this and you can go back and forth and whatever.

1885
02:02:40.92 --> 02:02:49.92
But, you know, that Bird wasn't as athletic as a lot of players in the NBA, but he was just such a hard worker that he was just going to outwork you.

1886
02:02:49.92 --> 02:02:50.92
Right.

1887
02:02:50.92 --> 02:02:51.92
And that's what he was going to do.

1888
02:02:51.92 --> 02:02:55.92
So my mindset was always like, I'm just going to have to work harder.

1889
02:02:55.92 --> 02:02:56.92
Yeah.

1890
02:02:56.92 --> 02:02:57.92
Like Bird.

1891
02:02:57.92 --> 02:02:58.92
Yeah.

1892
02:02:58.92 --> 02:03:04.92
Like, and that, you know, my dad, when I played basketball, if I didn't come home with like, skinned knees from diving on the floor,

1893
02:03:04.92 --> 02:03:05.92
Yeah.

1894
02:03:05.92 --> 02:03:06.92
That was like a fail.

1895
02:03:06.92 --> 02:03:07.92
Right.

1896
02:03:07.92 --> 02:03:07.92
Exactly.

1897
02:03:07.92 --> 02:03:11.92
Well, yeah, me and Tanner, Tanner was a basketball player.

1898
02:03:11.92 --> 02:03:16.92
And he, we had so many battles because I was probably like your dad.

1899
02:03:16.92 --> 02:03:19.92
And I would just be like, piss the whole time watching a play.

1900
02:03:19.92 --> 02:03:22.92
He would score 32 and a half one game.

1901
02:03:22.92 --> 02:03:25.92
And I'm like, I'm like, you're not even playing defense.

1902
02:03:25.92 --> 02:03:26.92
You know, yeah.

1903
02:03:26.92 --> 02:03:33.92
I go, you're not, you're not getting, I said, as soon as I ball leaves our hand from whoever you're guarding,

1904
02:03:33.92 --> 02:03:37.92
it has to go all the way to the floor and all the way back into the hand during that time.

1905
02:03:37.92 --> 02:03:39.92
Why don't you dive on it?

1906
02:03:39.92 --> 02:03:46.92
So then he finally, like, years later now, he watched some old tapes from high school.

1907
02:03:46.92 --> 02:03:49.92
And he's like, God, daddy, because I can't believe how lazy I was in defense.

1908
02:03:49.92 --> 02:03:51.92
And I'm like, no shit.

1909
02:03:51.92 --> 02:03:53.92
We had so many fights about it.

1910
02:03:53.92 --> 02:03:54.92
Yeah.

1911
02:03:54.92 --> 02:03:55.92
I sucked, by the way, I noticed that.

1912
02:03:55.92 --> 02:03:56.92
No, everyone.

1913
02:03:56.92 --> 02:03:57.92
I sucked at basketball.

1914
02:03:57.92 --> 02:04:00.92
I wasn't hostile to the, I was just hostile.

1915
02:04:00.92 --> 02:04:01.92
I would steal.

1916
02:04:01.92 --> 02:04:04.92
You know, I'd play, I would play D.

1917
02:04:04.92 --> 02:04:05.92
Yeah.

1918
02:04:05.92 --> 02:04:08.92
Well, that Larry Bird gave white guys hope.

1919
02:04:08.92 --> 02:04:14.92
But what people, what most people skip over is he was also like, what six, six, nine.

1920
02:04:14.92 --> 02:04:15.92
Nine?

1921
02:04:15.92 --> 02:04:16.92
Yeah.

1922
02:04:16.92 --> 02:04:19.92
So it's not like just a little white guy.

1923
02:04:19.92 --> 02:04:21.92
He could shoot better than anybody.

1924
02:04:21.92 --> 02:04:22.92
Yeah.

1925
02:04:22.92 --> 02:04:22.92
He was a beast.

1926
02:04:22.92 --> 02:04:23.92
Yeah.

1927
02:04:23.92 --> 02:04:25.92
So you got that cool chapter.

1928
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:30.92
You're kind of talking about what you take away from all those, all those badass individuals.

1929
02:04:30.92 --> 02:04:35.92
Then you got a section to hear this, this beast mode.

1930
02:04:35.92 --> 02:04:37.92
There are no rest days.

1931
02:04:37.92 --> 02:04:47.92
As irrational as it may seem in my mind, I'm not good enough to take a day off and I never will be running training and bow shooting have always been a therapy of sorts for me.

1932
02:04:47.92 --> 02:04:52.92
What I call my lift, run shoot lifestyle is a means to an end.

1933
02:04:52.92 --> 02:04:54.92
And that end is hunting.

1934
02:04:54.92 --> 02:04:57.92
Preparation is key to achieve any goal.

1935
02:04:57.92 --> 02:05:00.92
You cannot fall back on luck or talent.

1936
02:05:00.92 --> 02:05:03.92
Those will leave you empty handed every time.

1937
02:05:03.92 --> 02:05:06.92
You kind of made this point earlier and I knew this part was coming.

1938
02:05:06.92 --> 02:05:14.92
Like you can theoretically not be in good shape and go out and you can kill a bull.

1939
02:05:14.92 --> 02:05:16.92
It can happen.

1940
02:05:16.92 --> 02:05:17.92
Yeah.

1941
02:05:17.92 --> 02:05:26.92
And I've heard stories from guides telling me that there are people that show up to hunt that they really haven't really even cited in their bow yet.

1942
02:05:26.92 --> 02:05:27.92
I know.

1943
02:05:27.92 --> 02:05:28.92
I know.

1944
02:05:28.92 --> 02:05:30.92
I couldn't imagine being a guide.

1945
02:05:30.92 --> 02:05:37.92
I would hate to be like, I don't know how they just don't be like, what are you what in the hell is going on?

1946
02:05:37.92 --> 02:05:42.92
Because also to me, it's like it shows respect to the animal when you show it prepared.

1947
02:05:42.92 --> 02:05:45.92
You know, when you're not prepared, you're shooting an arrow.

1948
02:05:45.92 --> 02:05:49.92
You can hit it in the guts, you hit in the ass, hit it in the wherever.

1949
02:05:49.92 --> 02:05:54.92
It's like you don't care about that in almost life so literal or whatever.

1950
02:05:54.92 --> 02:05:56.92
I worded that wrong.

1951
02:05:56.92 --> 02:05:58.92
But I mean, it's so insignificant.

1952
02:05:58.92 --> 02:06:00.92
You can't prepare for this hunt.

1953
02:06:00.92 --> 02:06:02.92
That to me, I don't like that.

1954
02:06:02.92 --> 02:06:05.92
Um, yeah.

1955
02:06:05.92 --> 02:06:10.92
And then what you're saying, like, let's another underlying theme in your book is like,

1956
02:06:10.92 --> 02:06:13.92
Sure, you can theoretically do that.

1957
02:06:13.92 --> 02:06:20.92
But if you everything that you can do to be a little bit more prepared is going to just up your odds a little bit.

1958
02:06:20.92 --> 02:06:21.92
Yeah.

1959
02:06:21.92 --> 02:06:27.92
Well, I would always think that I've always thought about things and percentages and numbers.

1960
02:06:27.92 --> 02:06:32.92
And I'd always think even in basketball, so you could go back because I played all these sports.

1961
02:06:32.92 --> 02:06:36.92
But you know, try to get this to my kids and whatever.

1962
02:06:36.92 --> 02:06:39.92
But it's like the, the, so you're in better shape.

1963
02:06:39.92 --> 02:06:41.92
So your reaction time is probably a little quicker.

1964
02:06:41.92 --> 02:06:50.92
So if you can get and it might just be one finger hits that ball that that slows that ball down enough for the next guy down the line to where that passes.

1965
02:06:50.92 --> 02:06:52.92
Going, the ball's going slower.

1966
02:06:52.92 --> 02:06:55.92
So they could get to the ball, knock a loose, kick it to you.

1967
02:06:55.92 --> 02:06:57.92
You could score whatever.

1968
02:06:57.92 --> 02:07:03.92
All, and that started with the finger tip, which started with preparation, which started with the reaction time.

1969
02:07:03.92 --> 02:07:10.92
So it's like, I'd always say, you can't measure some of this stuff with these big, big factors and big numbers.

1970
02:07:10.92 --> 02:07:15.92
But it's percentage wise, even if it's a tenth of a percent, that adds up.

1971
02:07:15.92 --> 02:07:19.92
So the more I can do to add those percentages,

1972
02:07:19.92 --> 02:07:22.92
I'm just going to be that much better.

1973
02:07:22.92 --> 02:07:30.92
Yeah, that one tenth of a percent, that might be the one tenth of a percent that means a different success or failure.

1974
02:07:30.92 --> 02:07:36.92
Yeah, because also I've thought about this in terms of hunting, where if that broad head blade.

1975
02:07:36.92 --> 02:07:39.92
So I should have a poundage also when people want to criticize this.

1976
02:07:39.92 --> 02:07:41.92
You don't need to shoot 90 pounds or whatever.

1977
02:07:41.92 --> 02:07:47.92
So I'm always thinking like if that animal reacts and it's spinning when that arrow hits.

1978
02:07:47.92 --> 02:07:56.92
And because that force that arrow is greater, where instead of kicking off the bone and going, say, to the right, it pushes through the bone.

1979
02:07:56.92 --> 02:07:57.92
Get some more penetration.

1980
02:07:57.92 --> 02:08:00.92
And maybe catch is that one artery with one blade.

1981
02:08:00.92 --> 02:08:08.92
And that one blade cutting that artery because you have higher poundage and you're more prepared and you've got that arrow more where you wanted it to.

1982
02:08:08.92 --> 02:08:13.92
That artery would drip a blood that maybe you lost blood.

1983
02:08:13.92 --> 02:08:19.92
And then you found the one drop that led you the direction where the new found the animal or more blood.

1984
02:08:19.92 --> 02:08:22.92
But it was that one drop that did that.

1985
02:08:22.92 --> 02:08:27.92
What caused that extra drop of blood, which can make all the difference in the world.

1986
02:08:27.92 --> 02:08:33.92
And it's like you can't tell me all the shit I think about and all the work I put in doesn't make a difference.

1987
02:08:33.92 --> 02:08:36.92
Because you can't tell me that that's not an immeasurable.

1988
02:08:36.92 --> 02:08:37.92
Yeah.

1989
02:08:37.92 --> 02:08:38.92
That's that's a difference.

1990
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:43.92
I was shocked the first time I was following a blood trail.

1991
02:08:43.92 --> 02:08:45.92
I was with Dudley.

1992
02:08:45.92 --> 02:08:49.92
You are literally looking for blood.

1993
02:08:49.92 --> 02:08:54.92
That is a size of a actually smaller than the size of a pinhead.

1994
02:08:54.92 --> 02:08:55.92
Yeah.

1995
02:08:55.92 --> 02:08:58.92
I was like holy shit.

1996
02:08:58.92 --> 02:09:04.92
Like I'm following Dudley and he's walking all the sudden he's like right here because I'm following because I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

1997
02:09:04.92 --> 02:09:10.92
You know what we find. He's like right here and I got to get up and basically get on my knees and go oh yeah I see it.

1998
02:09:10.92 --> 02:09:10.92
Yeah.

1999
02:09:10.92 --> 02:09:12.92
Freaking skills.

2000
02:09:12.92 --> 02:09:13.92
Yeah.

2001
02:09:13.92 --> 02:09:17.92
And that's another you know when I was talking earlier about all the different skills that come into play.

2002
02:09:17.92 --> 02:09:19.92
That's just a shoot it.

2003
02:09:19.92 --> 02:09:22.92
Because once you shoot it it you got to go find it.

2004
02:09:22.92 --> 02:09:27.92
And there's a whole another incredible skill set that comes into play there.

2005
02:09:27.92 --> 02:09:28.92
Yeah.

2006
02:09:28.92 --> 02:09:30.92
And sometimes it's not even blood.

2007
02:09:30.92 --> 02:09:32.92
Sometimes it could just be right fluid.

2008
02:09:32.92 --> 02:09:36.92
Like if you hit back and maybe you hit guts that's not going to bleed.

2009
02:09:36.92 --> 02:09:38.92
There's not a lot of blood in the guts.

2010
02:09:38.92 --> 02:09:41.92
So but it might just be clear fluid.

2011
02:09:41.92 --> 02:09:48.92
So it's not even a red drop of blood but you're like hey you're looking at you know kind of doing a little autopsy.

2012
02:09:48.92 --> 02:09:51.92
You got to know you're like what you smell it.

2013
02:09:51.92 --> 02:09:55.92
Do you the texture then that leads you to blood.

2014
02:09:55.92 --> 02:10:00.92
But yeah it's a lot to a freaking hard game.

2015
02:10:00.92 --> 02:10:03.92
Yeah. You say I'm not even the best bow shot.

2016
02:10:03.92 --> 02:10:08.92
But I want to be there are guys in my hometown pro shop the bow rack.

2017
02:10:08.92 --> 02:10:09.92
Yeah.

2018
02:10:09.92 --> 02:10:12.92
That are better shots than me but I do work very hard at it.

2019
02:10:12.92 --> 02:10:15.92
The key to my success is to throw hard work at everything I do.

2020
02:10:15.92 --> 02:10:17.92
I can't scout elk every day.

2021
02:10:17.92 --> 02:10:20.92
So I lift, run and shoot.

2022
02:10:20.92 --> 02:10:21.92
Yeah.

2023
02:10:21.92 --> 02:10:27.92
I just like feel like that's moving that needle on the right direction.

2024
02:10:27.92 --> 02:10:35.92
You got a story in here that is really just lays all this out.

2025
02:10:35.92 --> 02:10:39.92
Going back to the book, do I deserve to be here?

2026
02:10:39.92 --> 02:10:44.92
I dreamt of hunting the sand Carlos Apache Indian reservation for decades.

2027
02:10:44.92 --> 02:10:50.92
Located in southeastern Arizona and encompassing 8.8 million acres of land.

2028
02:10:50.92 --> 02:10:55.92
Sand Carlos produces what I believe are the most amazing elk in the world.

2029
02:10:55.92 --> 02:11:04.92
The reservation allocates only a handful of tags each year because the densities are low and they manage this country for trophy bowls.

2030
02:11:04.92 --> 02:11:06.92
This means to hunt there is very expensive.

2031
02:11:06.92 --> 02:11:16.92
Altogether, I want like that cost uport of $70,000, which is more than I've made annually for nearly all of my life.

2032
02:11:16.92 --> 02:11:25.92
Compare that to the tag for my first out-of-state elk hunt in Wyoming, which costs $1100 bucks.

2033
02:11:25.92 --> 02:11:29.92
Nobody wants to have to right-to-check that big and have nothing to show for it.

2034
02:11:29.92 --> 02:11:33.92
So there's a lot riding on me making the perfect shot.

2035
02:11:33.92 --> 02:11:37.92
Bo hunting, the biggest, most coveted elk in the world adds to this pressure.

2036
02:11:37.92 --> 02:11:43.92
You can't stop thinking about all you've sacrificed and the years you've worked to pay for this opportunity

2037
02:11:43.92 --> 02:11:48.92
to me that money essentially could affect the quality of life provided for my family.

2038
02:11:48.92 --> 02:11:50.92
All this stuff starts weighing on you.

2039
02:11:50.92 --> 02:11:54.92
That was why I kept wondering whether I deserved the honor to be at Sand Carlos.

2040
02:11:54.92 --> 02:11:58.92
One of the many incredible hunting opportunities I've been blessed with over the years.

2041
02:11:58.92 --> 02:12:01.92
I felt like I didn't belong or didn't really deserve the chance.

2042
02:12:01.92 --> 02:12:09.92
I'm not sure why this is, but I know this perspective keeps me focusing on capitalizing and being appreciative of the experience.

2043
02:12:09.92 --> 02:12:14.92
My goal was to live up to the expectations of being respectful, bow hunter,

2044
02:12:14.92 --> 02:12:18.92
and celebrating these special elk mountains appropriately.

2045
02:12:18.92 --> 02:12:24.92
Two words that come to mind are the ones Maximus says at the start of the battle in gladiator.

2046
02:12:24.92 --> 02:12:26.92
Strength and honor.

2047
02:12:26.92 --> 02:12:31.92
Bow hunters need to be strong mentally and physically, but they also need to show honor.

2048
02:12:31.92 --> 02:12:37.92
Honor is to me, the attribute that makes bow hunting so special.

2049
02:12:37.92 --> 02:12:46.92
So this is talk about like, what, for someone that doesn't understand hunting,

2050
02:12:46.92 --> 02:12:52.92
what does it mean to go into this Indian reservation where they have limited number of elk.

2051
02:12:52.92 --> 02:12:57.92
Their trophy elk, which means their monsters.

2052
02:12:57.92 --> 02:13:01.92
And they can only allow so many people to hunt.

2053
02:13:01.92 --> 02:13:09.92
And because they can only allow so many people to hunt and because the elk are so monstrous, they are going to charge money for it.

2054
02:13:09.92 --> 02:13:12.92
Yeah, it's a supply and demand.

2055
02:13:12.92 --> 02:13:20.92
This place, like years, like 20 years ago there'd be a VHS tape out and say, you know, giant bulls of Santa Carlos.

2056
02:13:20.92 --> 02:13:22.92
We used to watch it at the bow rack.

2057
02:13:22.92 --> 02:13:26.92
And these bulls seem surreal how big they were.

2058
02:13:26.92 --> 02:13:36.92
And then the same species from the elk that we've we'd hunt, you know, giant bulls, 400 inch of owl, which is huge.

2059
02:13:36.92 --> 02:13:39.92
So this was like a legendary place.

2060
02:13:39.92 --> 02:13:43.92
And then because of the money, that eliminates a lot of people.

2061
02:13:43.92 --> 02:13:44.92
Pretty much everybody.

2062
02:13:44.92 --> 02:13:45.92
Pretty much everyone.

2063
02:13:45.92 --> 02:13:53.92
But the thing with there, it takes more than money because there's a lot of guys with money.

2064
02:13:53.92 --> 02:13:56.92
A lot of dickheads with money.

2065
02:13:56.92 --> 02:13:59.92
The tribe is going to deal with a bunch of dickheads.

2066
02:13:59.92 --> 02:14:03.92
They don't have to because they have the biggest bulls in the world.

2067
02:14:03.92 --> 02:14:11.92
So I remember this guy sent me this message a while ago and he said, you know, how do you get to hunt Santa Carlos?

2068
02:14:11.92 --> 02:14:16.92
I sent an email and I guess my 20 thousand dollars isn't enough for them.

2069
02:14:16.92 --> 02:14:21.92
You know, I'm like, why can't I already tell you're probably just a dumb fuck?

2070
02:14:21.92 --> 02:14:26.92
You know, so he could have, you know, offer a million.

2071
02:14:26.92 --> 02:14:30.92
They should probably not get a chance to hunt there because they're not going to deal with that.

2072
02:14:30.92 --> 02:14:36.92
So you have to be respectful, which I'm always respectful, but also I value what it means to hunt there.

2073
02:14:36.92 --> 02:14:41.92
And then also of sacrifice a lot to build and have that money.

2074
02:14:41.92 --> 02:14:43.92
And then still that wasn't enough.

2075
02:14:43.92 --> 02:14:44.92
Still it took.

2076
02:14:44.92 --> 02:14:52.92
And then he came up.

2077
02:14:52.92 --> 02:14:55.92
Folks is who got me the first opportunity there and he had hunted there one year and they could tell what type of guy he was.

2078
02:14:55.92 --> 02:14:57.92
He cared he's trying to do his best.

2079
02:14:57.92 --> 02:15:02.92
He didn't have the greatest hunt, but he paid his dues and put it in the time there.

2080
02:15:02.92 --> 02:15:08.92
And then this other tag came open and said, well, I've got a guy, you know, Cam.

2081
02:15:08.92 --> 02:15:13.92
I think, you know, if we could give him an opportunity here, I'll think you'll buy that tag.

2082
02:15:13.92 --> 02:15:14.76
what happened.

2083
02:15:14.76 --> 02:15:17.12
But it takes more than just money.

2084
02:15:17.12 --> 02:15:19.52
It takes a lot of things come in.

2085
02:15:19.52 --> 02:15:21.16
And Kipfokx just for a little intro,

2086
02:15:21.16 --> 02:15:23.92
he's one of the founders of Under Armor.

2087
02:15:23.92 --> 02:15:27.28
And well, he was freaking college athlete

2088
02:15:27.28 --> 02:15:30.64
stud, his damn self, playing lacrosse.

2089
02:15:30.64 --> 02:15:34.68
And then really was a huge part of the driving force

2090
02:15:34.68 --> 02:15:38.56
but behind the operations at Under Armor.

2091
02:15:38.56 --> 02:15:43.000
And then was the driving force between behind the Under Armor

2092
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.92
and the front, yep, stuff.

2093
02:15:44.92 --> 02:15:47.36
And now he's one of the driving forces behind the

2094
02:15:47.36 --> 02:15:49.36
origin hunt FYI.

2095
02:15:49.36 --> 02:15:50.52
Yeah.

2096
02:15:50.52 --> 02:15:52.84
He's definitely found that's his niche.

2097
02:15:52.84 --> 02:15:56.40
And he's such a hard worker and he cares about it.

2098
02:15:56.40 --> 02:15:59.72
He cares about for whatever reason.

2099
02:15:59.72 --> 02:16:04.20
That apparel that just building clothing,

2100
02:16:04.20 --> 02:16:05.28
is like his jam.

2101
02:16:05.28 --> 02:16:05.80
He loves it.

2102
02:16:05.80 --> 02:16:06.64
Yeah.

2103
02:16:08.92 --> 02:16:11.84
So you say this here, Kipfokx, one of the original founders

2104
02:16:11.84 --> 02:16:15.12
of Under Armor in a good friend of mine was there with me.

2105
02:16:15.12 --> 02:16:16.88
And he was the one who had given me this opportunity

2106
02:16:16.88 --> 02:16:19.48
at San Carlos as I headed out to the best elk country

2107
02:16:19.48 --> 02:16:21.08
in the world for two solid weeks.

2108
02:16:21.08 --> 02:16:24.16
If need be, I was confident.

2109
02:16:24.16 --> 02:16:26.48
But to think I'd even get a chance at a once in a lifetime

2110
02:16:26.48 --> 02:16:28.28
bull like this seemed completely far fetched.

2111
02:16:28.28 --> 02:16:29.08
So you're out.

2112
02:16:29.08 --> 02:16:30.48
They identified, do they?

2113
02:16:30.48 --> 02:16:33.64
They tell you, hey, we got a bull here that you might be,

2114
02:16:33.64 --> 02:16:35.20
because they're scouting bulls all the time.

2115
02:16:35.20 --> 02:16:36.04
Yeah.

2116
02:16:36.04 --> 02:16:37.88
And they find a 400-inch bull.

2117
02:16:37.88 --> 02:16:40.64
What if that's their estimation?

2118
02:16:40.64 --> 02:16:42.32
It's a 10 by 9.

2119
02:16:42.32 --> 02:16:42.92
Yeah.

2120
02:16:42.92 --> 02:16:44.000
That was crazy.

2121
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.04
That's insane.

2122
02:16:45.04 --> 02:16:46.24
That was, yeah.

2123
02:16:46.24 --> 02:16:50.96
And you nickname or they nickname the bull type bull,

2124
02:16:50.96 --> 02:16:53.96
because you have like a narrow rack with 10 by 9, but narrow.

2125
02:16:56.40 --> 02:16:59.80
So again, you go through some of the details here.

2126
02:16:59.80 --> 02:17:00.60
I'm going to pick it up.

2127
02:17:00.60 --> 02:17:01.80
You got a guide name, Chris.

2128
02:17:01.80 --> 02:17:04.68
Chris and Kip were behind me over a little spine

2129
02:17:04.68 --> 02:17:06.48
ridge about 40 yards away.

2130
02:17:06.48 --> 02:17:08.16
All good so far.

2131
02:17:08.16 --> 02:17:12.28
The still unseen bull screamed a bugle.

2132
02:17:12.28 --> 02:17:15.92
And by the way, right now, go on to YouTube and Google,

2133
02:17:15.92 --> 02:17:22.28
bull, elk, bugling and crank up the volume and then press play.

2134
02:17:22.28 --> 02:17:23.20
Yeah.

2135
02:17:23.20 --> 02:17:27.52
Because it is freaking primal insanity.

2136
02:17:27.52 --> 02:17:27.88
Yeah.

2137
02:17:27.88 --> 02:17:29.16
You hear those things going off?

2138
02:17:29.16 --> 02:17:30.48
It is.

2139
02:17:30.48 --> 02:17:33.88
So the still unseen bull screamed a bugle.

2140
02:17:33.88 --> 02:17:34.84
He was close.

2141
02:17:34.84 --> 02:17:37.20
I estimated where he'd come out of the timber

2142
02:17:37.20 --> 02:17:38.68
and looked for shooting lanes.

2143
02:17:38.68 --> 02:17:39.84
It was a mess.

2144
02:17:39.84 --> 02:17:43.16
The burn had burnt trees and brush everywhere.

2145
02:17:43.16 --> 02:17:45.76
I got nervous that once he entered the burn,

2146
02:17:45.76 --> 02:17:47.44
I wouldn't have a clear shot.

2147
02:17:47.44 --> 02:17:49.28
I had seconds to make a decisions.

2148
02:17:49.28 --> 02:17:52.24
At the moment of truth, a bow hunter makes certain decisions

2149
02:17:52.24 --> 02:17:54.24
that impact success or failure.

2150
02:17:54.24 --> 02:17:56.84
The line between the two is razor thin.

2151
02:17:56.84 --> 02:17:58.08
I glanced at the tree.

2152
02:17:58.08 --> 02:18:01.28
I was leaning against a notice some good limbs to climb.

2153
02:18:01.28 --> 02:18:05.68
I quickly surmised that I'd increase my potential shot opportunities

2154
02:18:05.68 --> 02:18:07.56
if I climbed up the tree.

2155
02:18:07.56 --> 02:18:11.12
Since I had been set up on the shady side of the tree,

2156
02:18:11.12 --> 02:18:14.76
my movement would be much less noticeable in the shadows.

2157
02:18:14.76 --> 02:18:17.08
Scaling the tree is quickly as I could.

2158
02:18:17.08 --> 02:18:21.48
I climbed 10 to 15 feet up in the air and set up to shoot.

2159
02:18:21.48 --> 02:18:25.48
This elevated position opened to my shooting lanes greatly.

2160
02:18:25.48 --> 02:18:28.000
Seconds after getting set in the tree,

2161
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.36
the bull ripped the bugle, answering Chris and exposing himself.

2162
02:18:32.36 --> 02:18:35.88
It was tight bull 30 yards away.

2163
02:18:35.88 --> 02:18:40.80
While we were in his country, we had no idea he was the bull coming in.

2164
02:18:40.80 --> 02:18:45.12
I took one quick look at his 400 inch 10 by 9 rack,

2165
02:18:45.12 --> 02:18:48.36
recognized what bull he was and directed my focus

2166
02:18:48.36 --> 02:18:51.36
on getting a good arrow in him.

2167
02:18:51.36 --> 02:18:54.72
Chris cow called the tight and tight bull closed in,

2168
02:18:54.72 --> 02:18:59.12
heading straight toward me and ultimately stopped directly underneath me.

2169
02:18:59.12 --> 02:19:01.84
I slowly eased my bow back.

2170
02:19:01.84 --> 02:19:04.64
The bull noticed movement or sensed or heard me

2171
02:19:04.64 --> 02:19:07.92
probably thinking mountain lion if you could vast him

2172
02:19:07.92 --> 02:19:11.16
and he became spooked running back toward the timber.

2173
02:19:11.16 --> 02:19:13.36
He stopped at just under 30 yards,

2174
02:19:13.36 --> 02:19:16.96
quartering away as I frantically tried to get position to shoot

2175
02:19:16.96 --> 02:19:22.24
while balancing on a burt tree limb 15 feet up.

2176
02:19:22.24 --> 02:19:25.04
When tight bull stood, staring back at me,

2177
02:19:25.04 --> 02:19:28.88
trying to piece together what was happening.

2178
02:19:28.88 --> 02:19:30.72
I had to act fast.

2179
02:19:30.72 --> 02:19:33.64
My sight was set on 30 yards, which would work.

2180
02:19:33.64 --> 02:19:37.52
So I quickly re-adjusted while trying to stay calm.

2181
02:19:37.52 --> 02:19:40.04
I settled my sight pin on his vitals,

2182
02:19:40.04 --> 02:19:42.60
but there was one small limb covering his chest

2183
02:19:42.60 --> 02:19:47.52
so I raised up on my tiptoes in the tree and picked a spot.

2184
02:19:47.52 --> 02:19:49.24
It was crunch time.

2185
02:19:49.24 --> 02:19:52.72
For a bow hunter, this is the most critical moment to master

2186
02:19:52.72 --> 02:19:56.52
as adrenaline speeds through your body and your heart races.

2187
02:19:56.52 --> 02:20:00.04
If you can't remain under control, success will be tough.

2188
02:20:00.04 --> 02:20:02.28
If you can, releasing a perfect arrow

2189
02:20:02.28 --> 02:20:04.28
is just another part of the process.

2190
02:20:04.28 --> 02:20:07.64
If you put in the work, you'll crave crunch time

2191
02:20:07.64 --> 02:20:09.92
because it's your chance to shine.

2192
02:20:09.92 --> 02:20:13.44
Bend that bow back anchor in, pick a spot,

2193
02:20:13.44 --> 02:20:17.000
and send a razor sharp broad head on its way.

2194
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.44
The arrow flashes toward the bull and lands home

2195
02:20:20.44 --> 02:20:23.72
as you knew it would because you've worked too hard to fail.

2196
02:20:23.72 --> 02:20:27.08
After following a short blood trail, you find your bull

2197
02:20:27.08 --> 02:20:29.80
and respectfully kneel by the amazing animal

2198
02:20:29.80 --> 02:20:31.80
that gave its life to you.

2199
02:20:31.80 --> 02:20:33.96
The bull's memory would be celebrated

2200
02:20:33.96 --> 02:20:36.56
when his antlers eventually adorned your wall

2201
02:20:36.56 --> 02:20:38.64
and his flesh nourished you.

2202
02:20:39.92 --> 02:20:44.92
I quickly let an arrow go toward the biggest bull I'd ever seen.

2203
02:20:44.92 --> 02:20:47.60
I felt confident in the shot on release,

2204
02:20:47.60 --> 02:20:49.76
confident about the work I put in,

2205
02:20:49.76 --> 02:20:53.96
confident the arrow would strike where I'd visualized it would perfect.

2206
02:20:55.68 --> 02:20:58.16
But that's not what happened.

2207
02:20:58.16 --> 02:21:00.76
The arrow flew off the mark hitting the bull,

2208
02:21:00.76 --> 02:21:04.96
high into the right striking the top of his shoulder blade.

2209
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:08.76
A high 24, far-forward shot is about the worst shot

2210
02:21:08.76 --> 02:21:12.08
you can make on a big bull since it's high and forward

2211
02:21:12.08 --> 02:21:15.80
of the lungs, which is where you want the arrow to hit.

2212
02:21:15.80 --> 02:21:18.68
The bull is protected by heavy muscle and bone,

2213
02:21:18.68 --> 02:21:22.08
so an arrow that strikes here will typically only wound the bull

2214
02:21:22.08 --> 02:21:23.64
and not cause death.

2215
02:21:23.64 --> 02:21:27.88
I felt sick to my stomach as a ran over the ridge

2216
02:21:27.88 --> 02:21:31.68
with what looked like half my arrow sticking out of his shoulder.

2217
02:21:31.68 --> 02:21:35.72
How did I blow an opportunity I'd worked my entire adult life

2218
02:21:35.72 --> 02:21:36.92
preparing for?

2219
02:21:36.92 --> 02:21:40.44
My dream became a nightmare in the fraction of a second.

2220
02:21:40.44 --> 02:21:44.64
It took my arrow to leave my bull and hit the bull.

2221
02:21:44.64 --> 02:21:49.64
That was rough.

2222
02:21:49.64 --> 02:21:52.64
That is a savage game right there.

2223
02:21:52.64 --> 02:21:56.64
Yeah, I mean, so it was 30 yards away.

2224
02:21:56.64 --> 02:21:59.64
Yeah, just under 30.

2225
02:21:59.64 --> 02:22:10.64
I feel like if I needed to like place a bet with my own life,

2226
02:22:10.64 --> 02:22:15.64
then you hitting a target at 30 yards,

2227
02:22:15.64 --> 02:22:18.64
I'd feel so comfortable when you take a shot.

2228
02:22:18.64 --> 02:22:21.64
I mean, this is what you do.

2229
02:22:21.64 --> 02:22:23.64
This is what you live for.

2230
02:22:23.64 --> 02:22:24.64
Yeah.

2231
02:22:24.64 --> 02:22:28.64
And that's what makes this freaking this game so crazy.

2232
02:22:28.64 --> 02:22:30.64
Yeah, it's so tough.

2233
02:22:30.64 --> 02:22:34.64
Being up in the tree was a different,

2234
02:22:34.64 --> 02:22:36.64
had some different factors in it.

2235
02:22:36.64 --> 02:22:39.64
Having that limb come across where,

2236
02:22:39.64 --> 02:22:42.64
you don't, you're the sight that you're looking at,

2237
02:22:42.64 --> 02:22:44.64
the line of sight you're looking at,

2238
02:22:44.64 --> 02:22:46.64
your arrow is below that.

2239
02:22:46.64 --> 02:22:48.64
So trying to figure out where your arrow is,

2240
02:22:48.64 --> 02:22:50.64
and this is going to cross into your line of sight,

2241
02:22:50.64 --> 02:22:51.64
and then hit the animal.

2242
02:22:51.64 --> 02:22:53.64
It's going to cross into your line of sight,

2243
02:22:53.64 --> 02:22:55.64
go above your line of sight and draw.

2244
02:22:55.64 --> 02:22:57.64
And then because I've learned that before,

2245
02:22:57.64 --> 02:23:00.64
where I've hit tree branches that were above my line of sight,

2246
02:23:00.64 --> 02:23:01.64
exactly.

2247
02:23:01.64 --> 02:23:03.64
So trying to anticipate that,

2248
02:23:03.64 --> 02:23:05.64
because I didn't know that bull was going to come underneath me,

2249
02:23:05.64 --> 02:23:07.64
and then spook and be there and have that limb there.

2250
02:23:07.64 --> 02:23:09.64
And I didn't know any of that was happening.

2251
02:23:09.64 --> 02:23:12.64
So having to try to calculate all that in the heat of the moment,

2252
02:23:12.64 --> 02:23:14.64
as a bull stand in there,

2253
02:23:14.64 --> 02:23:16.64
you know, nostrils flare and eyes wide,

2254
02:23:16.64 --> 02:23:20.64
figuring out, thought it's just going to get jumped on by a lion.

2255
02:23:20.64 --> 02:23:22.64
And I'm like, here's the bull.

2256
02:23:22.64 --> 02:23:24.64
This is a bull we've been looking for,

2257
02:23:24.64 --> 02:23:27.64
the tight bull, the 10 by 9, the 400 inches is it.

2258
02:23:27.64 --> 02:23:29.64
And then you do the best you can,

2259
02:23:29.64 --> 02:23:32.64
and I screwed up.

2260
02:23:32.64 --> 02:23:35.64
It just, it wasn't my best shot.

2261
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:38.64
And with all those factors in there,

2262
02:23:38.64 --> 02:23:43.64
is that did I do the best of those options?

2263
02:23:43.64 --> 02:23:46.64
Maybe, but it didn't help us,

2264
02:23:46.64 --> 02:23:49.64
because Arrow was the arrow ended up going in,

2265
02:23:49.64 --> 02:23:53.64
breaking off, and then I had 13 inches of arrow that had,

2266
02:23:53.64 --> 02:23:55.64
where broke off, there's a little blood on the shaft.

2267
02:23:55.64 --> 02:23:57.64
So 13 inches.

2268
02:23:57.64 --> 02:23:59.64
And, you know,

2269
02:23:59.64 --> 02:24:02.64
the last thing you want to do there,

2270
02:24:02.64 --> 02:24:04.64
when you're getting to once in a lifetime opportunity,

2271
02:24:04.64 --> 02:24:06.64
it's your first opportunity there,

2272
02:24:06.64 --> 02:24:09.64
the hunt that country is woundable.

2273
02:24:09.64 --> 02:24:11.64
Because on a hunt like that,

2274
02:24:11.64 --> 02:24:13.64
and any hunt, even at, you know,

2275
02:24:13.64 --> 02:24:15.64
like where you've been and you taught,

2276
02:24:15.64 --> 02:24:18.64
if you draw blood, no matter where you hit the animal,

2277
02:24:18.64 --> 02:24:20.64
that's your animal.

2278
02:24:20.64 --> 02:24:23.64
So, if I wound this bull,

2279
02:24:23.64 --> 02:24:26.64
and even if it doesn't die,

2280
02:24:26.64 --> 02:24:28.64
I'm paying for it.

2281
02:24:28.64 --> 02:24:30.64
70 grand.

2282
02:24:30.64 --> 02:24:32.64
So you end you wounded the animal.

2283
02:24:32.64 --> 02:24:36.64
I mean, the worst, because I put money aside,

2284
02:24:36.64 --> 02:24:39.64
I put that much pressure on myself anyway.

2285
02:24:39.64 --> 02:24:40.64
This is what I do.

2286
02:24:40.64 --> 02:24:42.64
It's what I've geared my whole life for.

2287
02:24:42.64 --> 02:24:45.64
So, even if it was $1 or $7 million,

2288
02:24:45.64 --> 02:24:47.64
I wouldn't have any more pressure.

2289
02:24:47.64 --> 02:24:51.64
It's still like, all this is my purpose.

2290
02:24:51.64 --> 02:24:54.64
But the money, when you're thinking about your family

2291
02:24:54.64 --> 02:24:57.64
and the sacrifices they've made for this,

2292
02:24:57.64 --> 02:25:00.64
then that just makes a worse.

2293
02:25:00.64 --> 02:25:03.64
And just so everybody knows,

2294
02:25:03.64 --> 02:25:07.64
elk are not human beings, obviously.

2295
02:25:07.64 --> 02:25:10.64
But if the reason I say that is because

2296
02:25:10.64 --> 02:25:12.64
they're so freaking tough.

2297
02:25:12.64 --> 02:25:13.64
Yes.

2298
02:25:13.64 --> 02:25:17.64
Like you put a 13, you put a broad head into a human being.

2299
02:25:17.64 --> 02:25:19.64
13 inches, they're gonna die.

2300
02:25:19.64 --> 02:25:20.64
Yeah.

2301
02:25:20.64 --> 02:25:21.64
Like anywhere in their torso,

2302
02:25:21.64 --> 02:25:22.64
they're gonna freak and die.

2303
02:25:22.64 --> 02:25:23.64
Right.

2304
02:25:23.64 --> 02:25:25.64
Especially what I mean, maybe if you get a massage or something.

2305
02:25:25.64 --> 02:25:29.64
But elk, they're crazy.

2306
02:25:29.64 --> 02:25:30.64
They're gonna be tough.

2307
02:25:30.64 --> 02:25:31.64
What they can survive.

2308
02:25:31.64 --> 02:25:32.64
Yeah.

2309
02:25:32.64 --> 02:25:33.64
No.

2310
02:25:33.64 --> 02:25:36.64
I mean, imagine how tough you would be if you slept outside for 365 days a year

2311
02:25:36.64 --> 02:25:39.64
on rock and dirt and weather.

2312
02:25:39.64 --> 02:25:40.64
Yeah.

2313
02:25:40.64 --> 02:25:42.64
And then in order to get a girlfriend,

2314
02:25:42.64 --> 02:25:45.64
you had to freaking go and ram heads fight

2315
02:25:45.64 --> 02:25:48.64
like a bunch of other dudes that had giant

2316
02:25:48.64 --> 02:25:50.64
spears coming out of their head.

2317
02:25:50.64 --> 02:25:51.64
Right.

2318
02:25:51.64 --> 02:25:52.64
Right.

2319
02:25:52.64 --> 02:25:54.64
So it's like they're built for that.

2320
02:25:54.64 --> 02:25:57.64
They're built to endure whatever.

2321
02:25:57.64 --> 02:25:59.64
And arrow, if it's not perfect.

2322
02:25:59.64 --> 02:26:00.64
Yeah.

2323
02:26:00.64 --> 02:26:01.64
It's gonna wound them.

2324
02:26:01.64 --> 02:26:04.64
They're, it's probably gonna, I don't know how they feel pain,

2325
02:26:04.64 --> 02:26:07.64
but they're gonna, they can get a long way.

2326
02:26:07.64 --> 02:26:09.64
They can go long ways survive a long time.

2327
02:26:09.64 --> 02:26:11.64
And they get stabbed with, yeah,

2328
02:26:11.64 --> 02:26:12.64
failures.

2329
02:26:12.64 --> 02:26:13.64
Yeah.

2330
02:26:13.64 --> 02:26:14.64
They get stabbed with antlers.

2331
02:26:14.64 --> 02:26:16.64
So this is sort of like a bad antler wound.

2332
02:26:16.64 --> 02:26:17.64
But that's what they deal with.

2333
02:26:17.64 --> 02:26:19.64
That's what they can actually cleaner.

2334
02:26:19.64 --> 02:26:20.64
You know, like I said.

2335
02:26:20.64 --> 02:26:22.64
So the right head is a cleaner cut.

2336
02:26:22.64 --> 02:26:26.64
And you know, you know how a clean cut can heal.

2337
02:26:26.64 --> 02:26:27.64
Right.

2338
02:26:27.64 --> 02:26:29.64
You know, so a puncture is,

2339
02:26:29.64 --> 02:26:32.64
is one of the worst things you can get for an injury.

2340
02:26:32.64 --> 02:26:34.64
So an antler puncturing.

2341
02:26:34.64 --> 02:26:35.64
Yeah.

2342
02:26:35.64 --> 02:26:40.64
I mean, they could overcome a point as they could overcome an arrow wound.

2343
02:26:40.64 --> 02:26:41.64
And they do all the time.

2344
02:26:41.64 --> 02:26:42.64
Yeah.

2345
02:26:42.64 --> 02:26:43.64
Yeah.

2346
02:26:45.64 --> 02:26:47.64
Going back to the book,

2347
02:26:47.64 --> 02:26:50.64
the type bowl was a regal animal I respected greatly,

2348
02:26:50.64 --> 02:26:53.64
but I failed to deliver the perfect shot.

2349
02:26:53.64 --> 02:26:56.64
I fucked up the shot from less than 30 yards.

2350
02:26:56.64 --> 02:27:02.64
I climbed down the burnt tree and slipped off my boots with just socks on my feet

2351
02:27:02.64 --> 02:27:04.64
and not hard-sold boots.

2352
02:27:04.64 --> 02:27:07.64
I could feel the ground better, which would allow me to sneak forward silently

2353
02:27:07.64 --> 02:27:11.64
and see what kind of blood I had to track.

2354
02:27:11.64 --> 02:27:13.64
As I followed the sparse blood trail,

2355
02:27:13.64 --> 02:27:14.64
my fears were confirmed.

2356
02:27:14.64 --> 02:27:17.64
The bull didn't bleed much at all a few drops,

2357
02:27:17.64 --> 02:27:21.64
which is what you'd expect given that shitty shot.

2358
02:27:21.64 --> 02:27:26.64
Eventually, the light blood trail stopped all together.

2359
02:27:26.64 --> 02:27:29.64
I was devastated, not only did I let myself down

2360
02:27:29.64 --> 02:27:32.64
and my family and friends and followers,

2361
02:27:32.64 --> 02:27:35.64
but I felt like I let the Apache tribe down as well.

2362
02:27:35.64 --> 02:27:38.64
This bull was so unique and so incredible

2363
02:27:38.64 --> 02:27:40.64
and I had made a poor shot on him.

2364
02:27:40.64 --> 02:27:41.64
He deserved better.

2365
02:27:41.64 --> 02:27:45.64
Now I had to go and tell the head of hunting for the tribe

2366
02:27:45.64 --> 02:27:47.64
that I had made a poor shot.

2367
02:27:47.64 --> 02:27:52.64
Kip, Chris and I hiked miles back to the truck.

2368
02:27:52.64 --> 02:27:54.64
Nobody said much.

2369
02:27:54.64 --> 02:27:57.64
I shook my head and started at the stairs at the ground.

2370
02:27:57.64 --> 02:27:59.64
I pit my stomach.

2371
02:27:59.64 --> 02:28:01.64
Yeah.

2372
02:28:01.64 --> 02:28:03.64
It's a bad feeling.

2373
02:28:03.64 --> 02:28:05.64
Dude.

2374
02:28:05.64 --> 02:28:07.64
This is like,

2375
02:28:07.64 --> 02:28:10.64
about hands are sweating right now.

2376
02:28:10.64 --> 02:28:11.64
Yeah.

2377
02:28:11.64 --> 02:28:14.64
You know, and like I said, I mean, obviously,

2378
02:28:14.64 --> 02:28:17.64
I'm like a complete amateur in this game,

2379
02:28:17.64 --> 02:28:24.64
but even when I put myself into your shoes as much of a perfectionist as you are,

2380
02:28:24.64 --> 02:28:29.64
and as much as I know you want to get the good shot

2381
02:28:29.64 --> 02:28:31.64
and then hear you are.

2382
02:28:31.64 --> 02:28:36.64
That's what I could say about being in the camps that I've been in.

2383
02:28:36.64 --> 02:28:39.64
Everybody knows exactly what just happened.

2384
02:28:39.64 --> 02:28:42.64
Like everyone knows there's no hiding.

2385
02:28:42.64 --> 02:28:45.64
Yeah.

2386
02:28:45.64 --> 02:28:48.64
It's just a, you know, you want to make a good shot.

2387
02:28:48.64 --> 02:28:51.64
You want to do your job, essentially.

2388
02:28:51.64 --> 02:28:54.64
And your job is to be,

2389
02:28:54.64 --> 02:28:58.64
build a vermursifl kill of the target animal.

2390
02:28:58.64 --> 02:29:03.64
So anything other than doing your job is tough,

2391
02:29:03.64 --> 02:29:06.64
especially in that circumstance.

2392
02:29:06.64 --> 02:29:09.64
Yeah, that's my first opportunity to show

2393
02:29:09.64 --> 02:29:12.64
you know what I was capable of in that environment in front of that,

2394
02:29:12.64 --> 02:29:14.64
the tribe and,

2395
02:29:14.64 --> 02:29:17.64
had been feel good.

2396
02:29:17.64 --> 02:29:19.64
I want to freaking rough game.

2397
02:29:19.64 --> 02:29:21.64
Yeah.

2398
02:29:21.64 --> 02:29:25.64
Yeah, I remember the first, the first time I shot a bowl,

2399
02:29:25.64 --> 02:29:28.64
I shot a shitty shot.

2400
02:29:28.64 --> 02:29:31.64
Heated in the leg,

2401
02:29:31.64 --> 02:29:34.64
luckily hit an artery,

2402
02:29:34.64 --> 02:29:35.64
but,

2403
02:29:35.64 --> 02:29:40.64
you know,

2404
02:29:40.64 --> 02:29:43.64
Dudley and I attracted until dark.

2405
02:29:43.64 --> 02:29:45.64
We still didn't find it.

2406
02:29:45.64 --> 02:29:46.64
We're walking back.

2407
02:29:46.64 --> 02:29:50.64
I mean, I just, I feel absolutely like,

2408
02:29:50.64 --> 02:29:52.64
horrible and I feel like horrible because I wounded this animal.

2409
02:29:52.64 --> 02:29:54.64
I feel horrible because I let Dudley down,

2410
02:29:54.64 --> 02:29:58.64
who like invested time and effort into me to,

2411
02:29:58.64 --> 02:30:02.64
to give me this opportunity to do this.

2412
02:30:02.64 --> 02:30:05.64
And on top of that quite frankly,

2413
02:30:05.64 --> 02:30:08.64
I didn't even understand that this happened.

2414
02:30:08.64 --> 02:30:12.64
I thought I was like the only person

2415
02:30:12.64 --> 02:30:14.64
that this had ever happened.

2416
02:30:14.64 --> 02:30:16.64
And that's why when I got back to camp,

2417
02:30:16.64 --> 02:30:19.64
I sat down with you and Dudley and Joe

2418
02:30:19.64 --> 02:30:21.64
and we're kind of sitting there eating.

2419
02:30:21.64 --> 02:30:24.64
And you must have just looked at my face.

2420
02:30:24.64 --> 02:30:26.64
It felt like you better like helped me.

2421
02:30:26.64 --> 02:30:27.64
Well,

2422
02:30:27.64 --> 02:30:32.64
because, and you basically told me like a couple stories

2423
02:30:32.64 --> 02:30:35.64
and you were like, hey man, you know, like, this happens.

2424
02:30:35.64 --> 02:30:37.64
And you know,

2425
02:30:37.64 --> 02:30:39.64
and it does.

2426
02:30:39.64 --> 02:30:41.64
And you know, you talked to the guides up there

2427
02:30:41.64 --> 02:30:43.64
and it's, you know,

2428
02:30:43.64 --> 02:30:47.64
there's a decent, it's hard to kill an elk with one shot

2429
02:30:47.64 --> 02:30:49.64
and it happens instantly.

2430
02:30:49.64 --> 02:30:50.64
That's a tough shot.

2431
02:30:50.64 --> 02:30:51.64
Yeah.

2432
02:30:51.64 --> 02:30:54.64
It's like one of those things though that,

2433
02:30:54.64 --> 02:30:56.64
nobody wants to talk about really,

2434
02:30:56.64 --> 02:30:58.64
but it does happen.

2435
02:30:58.64 --> 02:31:00.64
And it's like, you know,

2436
02:31:00.64 --> 02:31:02.64
mean Roy, we'd call each other on the phone

2437
02:31:02.64 --> 02:31:06.64
and it'd be like, how the hunt go, did you kill?

2438
02:31:06.64 --> 02:31:08.64
There's only one of two answers.

2439
02:31:08.64 --> 02:31:11.64
Nobody gives a shit about anything else

2440
02:31:11.64 --> 02:31:13.64
than yes or no.

2441
02:31:13.64 --> 02:31:16.64
So, in a, in a hunting camp setting like that,

2442
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:17.64
yes, it happens.

2443
02:31:17.64 --> 02:31:19.64
But like, I know how the guides talk

2444
02:31:19.64 --> 02:31:22.64
and how just, not there specifically,

2445
02:31:22.64 --> 02:31:23.64
but just anywhere.

2446
02:31:23.64 --> 02:31:26.64
And it's like how that would be summed up

2447
02:31:26.64 --> 02:31:28.64
would be like, you know,

2448
02:31:28.64 --> 02:31:30.64
camp wounded.

2449
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:33.64
Nobody needs anything else,

2450
02:31:33.64 --> 02:31:34.64
doesn't fucking matter.

2451
02:31:34.64 --> 02:31:36.64
Did you kill?

2452
02:31:36.64 --> 02:31:38.64
No, you wounded.

2453
02:31:38.64 --> 02:31:40.64
Yeah.

2454
02:31:40.64 --> 02:31:42.64
That all that you can justify,

2455
02:31:42.64 --> 02:31:44.64
you can explain,

2456
02:31:44.64 --> 02:31:45.64
it doesn't matter.

2457
02:31:45.64 --> 02:31:48.64
So it's like, just summed up,

2458
02:31:48.64 --> 02:31:50.64
like no matter how, how people talk

2459
02:31:50.64 --> 02:31:52.64
or make you feel better or whatever.

2460
02:31:52.64 --> 02:31:55.64
It doesn't really help.

2461
02:31:55.64 --> 02:31:57.64
And that's why this, this game is,

2462
02:31:57.64 --> 02:31:59.64
is freaking challenging.

2463
02:31:59.64 --> 02:32:00.64
Yeah.

2464
02:32:00.64 --> 02:32:01.64
And, but here's the thing,

2465
02:32:01.64 --> 02:32:02.64
that's why it's so rewarding.

2466
02:32:02.64 --> 02:32:03.64
Yeah.

2467
02:32:03.64 --> 02:32:04.64
You know, and so I,

2468
02:32:04.64 --> 02:32:06.64
I probably sound pretty negative right now

2469
02:32:06.64 --> 02:32:07.64
because it is hard as hell,

2470
02:32:07.64 --> 02:32:09.64
but that's what makes it so rewarding.

2471
02:32:09.64 --> 02:32:10.64
Yeah.

2472
02:32:10.64 --> 02:32:11.64
That's what makes it so awesome.

2473
02:32:11.64 --> 02:32:14.64
When you pull it off and you get it done.

2474
02:32:14.64 --> 02:32:16.64
So.

2475
02:32:16.64 --> 02:32:17.64
Yeah.

2476
02:32:17.64 --> 02:32:19.64
Ah.

2477
02:32:19.64 --> 02:32:21.64
Going back to the book here.

2478
02:32:21.64 --> 02:32:23.64
Before we're going to bed that night,

2479
02:32:23.64 --> 02:32:24.64
Kippin' I talked about typo,

2480
02:32:24.64 --> 02:32:26.64
what do you think the odds are

2481
02:32:26.64 --> 02:32:27.64
that we're going to get him,

2482
02:32:27.64 --> 02:32:29.64
Kippin' past 20% I said.

2483
02:32:29.64 --> 02:32:30.64
It's not good.

2484
02:32:30.64 --> 02:32:32.64
A high shoulder shot on a big bull,

2485
02:32:32.64 --> 02:32:34.64
like that, I fucked up.

2486
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:36.64
Well, shit, he muttered.

2487
02:32:36.64 --> 02:32:38.64
I had a hard time sleeping even for a second

2488
02:32:38.64 --> 02:32:39.64
that night,

2489
02:32:39.64 --> 02:32:40.64
and it wasn't the first time.

2490
02:32:40.64 --> 02:32:43.64
I've had heartbreak in the mountains.

2491
02:32:43.64 --> 02:32:45.64
I remember more than once

2492
02:32:45.64 --> 02:32:46.64
blowing it on a big bull,

2493
02:32:46.64 --> 02:32:48.64
times when I should have gotten a kill

2494
02:32:48.64 --> 02:32:50.64
and screwed it up.

2495
02:32:50.64 --> 02:32:52.64
And it has haunted me.

2496
02:32:52.64 --> 02:32:55.64
Crushed me.

2497
02:32:55.64 --> 02:32:57.64
The next morning we got up and headed out

2498
02:32:57.64 --> 02:33:00.64
at first light to where I hit the tight bull.

2499
02:33:00.64 --> 02:33:02.64
Mark and Dan Stevens, Chris's uncle,

2500
02:33:02.64 --> 02:33:04.64
and cousin joined us to lend a hand

2501
02:33:04.64 --> 02:33:05.64
if need be.

2502
02:33:05.64 --> 02:33:06.64
We all walked to a ridge line

2503
02:33:06.64 --> 02:33:09.64
a mile or more away from where I had shot the bull.

2504
02:33:09.64 --> 02:33:11.64
As I scanned across the canyon with my optics,

2505
02:33:11.64 --> 02:33:13.64
I spotted something that I couldn't make out.

2506
02:33:13.64 --> 02:33:14.64
What am I looking at?

2507
02:33:14.64 --> 02:33:15.64
I asked the guys,

2508
02:33:15.64 --> 02:33:17.64
by those yellow quaking asspins

2509
02:33:17.64 --> 02:33:19.64
to the bottom left of them.

2510
02:33:19.64 --> 02:33:20.64
What am I seeing?

2511
02:33:20.64 --> 02:33:22.64
That's your bull, Chris said.

2512
02:33:22.64 --> 02:33:23.64
He was bedded.

2513
02:33:23.64 --> 02:33:26.64
I studied intently through my binos

2514
02:33:26.64 --> 02:33:29.64
and I didn't see a move.

2515
02:33:29.64 --> 02:33:30.64
Is he dead?

2516
02:33:30.64 --> 02:33:32.64
I asked Chris Cow called

2517
02:33:32.64 --> 02:33:33.64
and right when he did,

2518
02:33:33.64 --> 02:33:34.64
the bull moved his head.

2519
02:33:34.64 --> 02:33:35.64
Fuck.

2520
02:33:35.64 --> 02:33:37.64
He's not dead,

2521
02:33:37.64 --> 02:33:38.64
but he's hurt.

2522
02:33:38.64 --> 02:33:39.64
All right, I told him.

2523
02:33:39.64 --> 02:33:42.64
Let me go down and get this mess cleaned up.

2524
02:33:42.64 --> 02:33:43.64
As they stayed there,

2525
02:33:43.64 --> 02:33:44.64
I made a big circle around

2526
02:33:44.64 --> 02:33:46.64
to the other side of the canyon

2527
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:47.64
where typo was bedded.

2528
02:33:47.64 --> 02:33:49.64
It took me over an hour, maybe even two hours,

2529
02:33:49.64 --> 02:33:51.64
as I wasn't taking any chances with the wind

2530
02:33:51.64 --> 02:33:53.64
and went very wide.

2531
02:33:53.64 --> 02:33:56.64
When I was a couple hundred yards

2532
02:33:56.64 --> 02:33:58.64
from the three quakes,

2533
02:33:58.64 --> 02:33:59.64
which were my landmarks,

2534
02:33:59.64 --> 02:34:00.64
I slipped off my boots

2535
02:34:00.64 --> 02:34:01.64
and continued on slowly

2536
02:34:01.64 --> 02:34:03.64
and silently and just my socks.

2537
02:34:03.64 --> 02:34:04.64
As I neared where typo

2538
02:34:04.64 --> 02:34:05.64
should be,

2539
02:34:05.64 --> 02:34:06.64
I looked through my binoculars

2540
02:34:06.64 --> 02:34:08.64
over to Kit Mark Dan and Chris

2541
02:34:08.64 --> 02:34:10.64
and saw them motioning with their hands.

2542
02:34:10.64 --> 02:34:12.64
With hand signals from a mile away,

2543
02:34:12.64 --> 02:34:13.64
they were telling me

2544
02:34:13.64 --> 02:34:15.64
that the bull was going up the hill.

2545
02:34:15.64 --> 02:34:16.64
When I neared the quakes,

2546
02:34:16.64 --> 02:34:18.64
I spotted him slowly making his way up the hill.

2547
02:34:18.64 --> 02:34:19.64
He was stoved up,

2548
02:34:19.64 --> 02:34:21.64
but I needed to get another arrow

2549
02:34:21.64 --> 02:34:23.64
in him or risk losing him.

2550
02:34:23.64 --> 02:34:25.64
It was going to take a very long bow shot

2551
02:34:25.64 --> 02:34:26.64
to make that happen,

2552
02:34:26.64 --> 02:34:28.64
but I got a good range on him

2553
02:34:28.64 --> 02:34:30.64
and I knew exactly the distance.

2554
02:34:30.64 --> 02:34:32.64
I already had an arrow knock

2555
02:34:32.64 --> 02:34:33.64
so I quickly dialed in my sight

2556
02:34:33.64 --> 02:34:35.64
and drew back my bowstring.

2557
02:34:35.64 --> 02:34:37.64
Settling my pin on his ribs

2558
02:34:37.64 --> 02:34:38.64
as he quartered away,

2559
02:34:38.64 --> 02:34:40.64
he would take a couple extra steps

2560
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:41.64
and stop, re-gather himself,

2561
02:34:41.64 --> 02:34:43.64
and take another couple extra steps.

2562
02:34:43.64 --> 02:34:45.64
I waited at full draw for him to stop.

2563
02:34:45.64 --> 02:34:47.64
By this time I was completely relaxed

2564
02:34:47.64 --> 02:34:49.64
and felt rock steady.

2565
02:34:49.64 --> 02:34:51.64
Pulling my bow hard against my back wall

2566
02:34:51.64 --> 02:34:52.64
of my draw,

2567
02:34:52.64 --> 02:34:54.64
I cheated the pin up a couple inches

2568
02:34:54.64 --> 02:34:56.64
on his body as he moved

2569
02:34:56.64 --> 02:34:58.64
a yard or two further up the hill

2570
02:34:58.64 --> 02:34:59.64
from when I had ranged him

2571
02:34:59.64 --> 02:35:02.64
and slowly squeezed the trigger of my release.

2572
02:35:02.64 --> 02:35:04.64
The arrow are tied,

2573
02:35:04.64 --> 02:35:05.64
covering the long distance

2574
02:35:05.64 --> 02:35:06.64
before dropping home,

2575
02:35:06.64 --> 02:35:07.64
sinking into his ribs

2576
02:35:07.64 --> 02:35:10.64
as it angled toward the bull's lungs.

2577
02:35:10.64 --> 02:35:12.64
This time my shot was perfect.

2578
02:35:12.64 --> 02:35:13.64
I hustled up the mountain as fast

2579
02:35:13.64 --> 02:35:14.64
as I could in my socks

2580
02:35:14.64 --> 02:35:16.64
knocking in arrows I went.

2581
02:35:16.64 --> 02:35:18.64
He hadn't gone far from where I had hit him

2582
02:35:18.64 --> 02:35:19.64
and those still on his feet

2583
02:35:19.64 --> 02:35:21.64
now his head was down.

2584
02:35:21.64 --> 02:35:24.64
He was quite a poke 92 yards

2585
02:35:24.64 --> 02:35:25.64
but I was in kill mode

2586
02:35:25.64 --> 02:35:27.64
as I came to full draw

2587
02:35:27.64 --> 02:35:30.64
and released again the second long bow shot

2588
02:35:30.64 --> 02:35:31.64
also hit him perfectly.

2589
02:35:31.64 --> 02:35:33.64
The bow went down

2590
02:35:33.64 --> 02:35:34.64
and after a few kicks

2591
02:35:34.64 --> 02:35:35.64
died quickly,

2592
02:35:35.64 --> 02:35:37.64
a wave of relief

2593
02:35:37.64 --> 02:35:39.64
washed over me.

2594
02:35:39.64 --> 02:35:42.64
And then you get to him

2595
02:35:42.64 --> 02:35:44.64
sitting beside the dead tight bull

2596
02:35:44.64 --> 02:35:46.64
was a bittersweet moment of relief.

2597
02:35:46.64 --> 02:35:48.64
My mind was conflicted.

2598
02:35:48.64 --> 02:35:50.64
I had succeeded in achieving my goal

2599
02:35:50.64 --> 02:35:52.64
but knowing I had ended the life

2600
02:35:52.64 --> 02:35:54.64
of a truly majestic animal

2601
02:35:54.64 --> 02:35:56.64
to do so brings a hint of melancholy.

2602
02:35:56.64 --> 02:35:58.64
There was also a solemn sense of pride

2603
02:35:58.64 --> 02:36:00.64
that comes with knowing once the bull hit the ground

2604
02:36:00.64 --> 02:36:02.64
the ending of his life

2605
02:36:02.64 --> 02:36:03.64
would help sustain me

2606
02:36:03.64 --> 02:36:05.64
and my family for months.

2607
02:36:05.64 --> 02:36:08.64
I took a moment to give reverence

2608
02:36:08.64 --> 02:36:10.64
for the life of the animal I killed.

2609
02:36:10.64 --> 02:36:12.64
Thanks for the nourishment beast.

2610
02:36:12.64 --> 02:36:14.64
Your flesh will fuel me

2611
02:36:14.64 --> 02:36:16.64
and your antlers on my wall

2612
02:36:16.64 --> 02:36:19.64
will ensure your life is honored

2613
02:36:19.64 --> 02:36:21.64
as long as I live.

2614
02:36:26.64 --> 02:36:28.64
Got it done.

2615
02:36:28.64 --> 02:36:30.64
And you know,

2616
02:36:30.64 --> 02:36:31.64
there you are

2617
02:36:31.64 --> 02:36:32.64
the next day

2618
02:36:32.64 --> 02:36:35.64
making a shot at 92 yards

2619
02:36:35.64 --> 02:36:36.64
another shot at whatever

2620
02:36:36.64 --> 02:36:38.64
90, probably 94

2621
02:36:38.64 --> 02:36:39.64
95 yards

2622
02:36:39.64 --> 02:36:41.64
both perfect shots.

2623
02:36:41.64 --> 02:36:43.64
Yeah, I think the first one

2624
02:36:43.64 --> 02:36:44.64
was the first one I think was actually

2625
02:36:44.64 --> 02:36:46.64
a hundred and seven.

2626
02:36:46.64 --> 02:36:47.64
And then the second one

2627
02:36:47.64 --> 02:36:49.64
I had snuck up a little bit

2628
02:36:49.64 --> 02:36:51.64
and he didn't go that far

2629
02:36:51.64 --> 02:36:52.64
and so he was 92 in the second

2630
02:36:52.64 --> 02:36:53.64
but the first one was

2631
02:36:53.64 --> 02:36:55.64
a little over a hundred.

2632
02:36:55.64 --> 02:36:56.64
Yeah, and to everybody knows

2633
02:36:56.64 --> 02:36:58.64
like most people want to shoot

2634
02:36:58.64 --> 02:37:00.64
no further than 50 yards.

2635
02:37:00.64 --> 02:37:01.64
Yeah, I would say.

2636
02:37:01.64 --> 02:37:03.64
And I think 40 is really what

2637
02:37:03.64 --> 02:37:05.64
most people feel very confident

2638
02:37:05.64 --> 02:37:06.64
in it.

2639
02:37:06.64 --> 02:37:06.64
Yeah.

2640
02:37:06.64 --> 02:37:08.64
50 is out

2641
02:37:08.64 --> 02:37:10.64
a little bit further, but

2642
02:37:10.64 --> 02:37:11.64
a hundred and seven.

2643
02:37:11.64 --> 02:37:12.64
That's a long shot.

2644
02:37:12.64 --> 02:37:13.64
It's a long shot.

2645
02:37:13.64 --> 02:37:14.64
Yeah.

2646
02:37:14.64 --> 02:37:16.64
I just wanted to get, you know,

2647
02:37:16.64 --> 02:37:19.64
in my head that animal had suffered

2648
02:37:19.64 --> 02:37:20.64
all night.

2649
02:37:20.64 --> 02:37:22.64
And so I wanted to

2650
02:37:22.64 --> 02:37:23.64
just do it.

2651
02:37:23.64 --> 02:37:25.64
I should have done the first time

2652
02:37:25.64 --> 02:37:28.64
and just close a deal.

2653
02:37:28.64 --> 02:37:31.64
It's an interesting parallel

2654
02:37:31.64 --> 02:37:32.64
with you, Jitsu.

2655
02:37:32.64 --> 02:37:33.64
I can Jitsu.

2656
02:37:33.64 --> 02:37:34.64
You go and train and you

2657
02:37:34.64 --> 02:37:36.64
you get tapped out by people

2658
02:37:36.64 --> 02:37:39.64
and you keep coming back.

2659
02:37:39.64 --> 02:37:42.64
And like if you never got tapped out

2660
02:37:42.64 --> 02:37:45.64
it's to me if I never got tapped out

2661
02:37:45.64 --> 02:37:47.64
I would probably not come back as often.

2662
02:37:47.64 --> 02:37:48.64
Right.

2663
02:37:48.64 --> 02:37:51.64
If bow hunting was easy,

2664
02:37:51.64 --> 02:37:53.64
it wouldn't be so rewarding.

2665
02:37:53.64 --> 02:37:54.64
Right.

2666
02:37:54.64 --> 02:37:56.64
It wouldn't be the draw.

2667
02:37:56.64 --> 02:37:57.64
Yeah.

2668
02:37:57.64 --> 02:37:59.64
And it's like if that to me,

2669
02:37:59.64 --> 02:38:00.64
that's the only thing

2670
02:38:00.64 --> 02:38:02.64
the only reason I've ever stood out

2671
02:38:02.64 --> 02:38:03.64
in life.

2672
02:38:03.64 --> 02:38:05.64
So it's like I feel

2673
02:38:05.64 --> 02:38:08.64
this is what I was supposed to be good at.

2674
02:38:08.64 --> 02:38:10.64
This is what I was supposed to do.

2675
02:38:10.64 --> 02:38:11.64
This is my thing.

2676
02:38:11.64 --> 02:38:14.64
So to fail,

2677
02:38:14.64 --> 02:38:17.64
it feels different with to me also.

2678
02:38:17.64 --> 02:38:18.64
Yeah.

2679
02:38:18.64 --> 02:38:19.64
While it's going to say that earlier

2680
02:38:19.64 --> 02:38:20.64
when you were like,

2681
02:38:20.64 --> 02:38:21.64
well, it's a lot of money

2682
02:38:21.64 --> 02:38:22.64
and there's a lot of pressure

2683
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:25.64
from wanting to do the right thing.

2684
02:38:25.64 --> 02:38:26.64
And I was like, oh,

2685
02:38:26.64 --> 02:38:27.64
end your campaigns.

2686
02:38:27.64 --> 02:38:28.64
Yeah.

2687
02:38:28.64 --> 02:38:29.64
You know,

2688
02:38:29.64 --> 02:38:31.64
like this is,

2689
02:38:31.64 --> 02:38:32.64
you carry,

2690
02:38:32.64 --> 02:38:34.64
it's like when the Gracie family

2691
02:38:34.64 --> 02:38:35.64
is like, you did do.

2692
02:38:35.64 --> 02:38:36.64
Right.

2693
02:38:36.64 --> 02:38:38.64
They're carrying their family name.

2694
02:38:38.64 --> 02:38:39.64
Which is a,

2695
02:38:39.64 --> 02:38:40.64
which is kind of a rough thing.

2696
02:38:40.64 --> 02:38:41.64
Because that's hard.

2697
02:38:41.64 --> 02:38:42.64
When you're,

2698
02:38:42.64 --> 02:38:44.64
the Gracie family's huge.

2699
02:38:44.64 --> 02:38:45.64
And there might be some kid

2700
02:38:45.64 --> 02:38:47.64
that's 14 years old

2701
02:38:47.64 --> 02:38:48.64
that started training two years ago,

2702
02:38:48.64 --> 02:38:50.64
but he's part of the Gracie family.

2703
02:38:50.64 --> 02:38:51.64
Yeah.

2704
02:38:51.64 --> 02:38:52.64
So you have, you know,

2705
02:38:52.64 --> 02:38:53.64
that's your name.

2706
02:38:53.64 --> 02:38:54.64
Right.

2707
02:38:54.64 --> 02:38:55.64
Yeah.

2708
02:38:55.64 --> 02:38:57.64
Yeah.

2709
02:38:57.64 --> 02:38:58.64
So it's,

2710
02:38:58.64 --> 02:38:59.64
they,

2711
02:38:59.64 --> 02:39:00.64
when they,

2712
02:39:00.64 --> 02:39:01.64
they were watching from the

2713
02:39:01.64 --> 02:39:04.64
Ridge, you know, where we first saw the bull.

2714
02:39:04.64 --> 02:39:07.64
And so they said that me making those two shots

2715
02:39:07.64 --> 02:39:08.64
to kill it,

2716
02:39:08.64 --> 02:39:10.64
made out for,

2717
02:39:10.64 --> 02:39:11.64
so that,

2718
02:39:11.64 --> 02:39:13.64
if I'd already let everybody down on it

2719
02:39:13.64 --> 02:39:14.64
and like,

2720
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:14.64
like,

2721
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:14.64
it,

2722
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:14.64
well,

2723
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:15.64
that got me back to zero.

2724
02:39:15.64 --> 02:39:16.64
That got to level down to get.

2725
02:39:16.64 --> 02:39:17.64
Yeah.

2726
02:39:17.64 --> 02:39:17.64
Yeah.

2727
02:39:17.64 --> 02:39:18.64
Did anybody get video of it?

2728
02:39:18.64 --> 02:39:19.64
No.

2729
02:39:19.64 --> 02:39:20.64
No,

2730
02:39:20.64 --> 02:39:21.64
not from that far.

2731
02:39:21.64 --> 02:39:22.64
Nobody had anything.

2732
02:39:22.64 --> 02:39:23.64
Yeah.

2733
02:39:23.64 --> 02:39:25.64
We haven't never really had a camera crew there.

2734
02:39:25.64 --> 02:39:26.64
Mm-hmm.

2735
02:39:26.64 --> 02:39:27.64
Yeah.

2736
02:39:27.64 --> 02:39:28.64
The camera crew you were talking about

2737
02:39:28.64 --> 02:39:29.64
earlier like that.

2738
02:39:29.64 --> 02:39:30.64
That's another dynamic we're doing.

2739
02:39:30.64 --> 02:39:31.64
Yeah.

2740
02:39:31.64 --> 02:39:32.64
That's a dynamic we're doing this stuff.

2741
02:39:32.64 --> 02:39:33.64
Oh man.

2742
02:39:33.64 --> 02:39:35.64
That must really bother you.

2743
02:39:35.64 --> 02:39:36.64
Yeah.

2744
02:39:36.64 --> 02:39:37.64
I mean,

2745
02:39:37.64 --> 02:39:38.64
I,

2746
02:39:38.64 --> 02:39:39.64
I don't like having with anybody.

2747
02:39:39.64 --> 02:39:40.64
Yeah.

2748
02:39:40.64 --> 02:39:41.64
That's what I'm saying.

2749
02:39:41.64 --> 02:39:42.64
So even on these guided hunts,

2750
02:39:42.64 --> 02:39:43.64
and they,

2751
02:39:43.64 --> 02:39:44.64
they already,

2752
02:39:44.64 --> 02:39:45.64
they all know this,

2753
02:39:45.64 --> 02:39:46.64
but I don't,

2754
02:39:46.64 --> 02:39:47.64
I just want to do it.

2755
02:39:47.64 --> 02:39:48.64
You know,

2756
02:39:48.64 --> 02:39:49.64
I don't need help.

2757
02:39:49.64 --> 02:39:50.64
If I screw up,

2758
02:39:50.64 --> 02:39:51.64
I wanted to be me screwing up.

2759
02:39:51.64 --> 02:39:52.64
But so then,

2760
02:39:52.64 --> 02:39:53.64
then,

2761
02:39:53.64 --> 02:39:54.64
we have a camera man there.

2762
02:39:54.64 --> 02:39:55.64
You know,

2763
02:39:55.64 --> 02:39:56.64
there's always somebody to blame.

2764
02:39:56.64 --> 02:39:57.64
So the camera man,

2765
02:39:57.64 --> 02:39:59.64
it's like the worst job ever.

2766
02:39:59.64 --> 02:40:00.64
There's anything,

2767
02:40:00.64 --> 02:40:01.64
any of the steak,

2768
02:40:01.64 --> 02:40:02.64
it's like,

2769
02:40:02.64 --> 02:40:02.64
you know,

2770
02:40:02.64 --> 02:40:04.64
they saw the camera or they heard you.

2771
02:40:04.64 --> 02:40:05.64
Whatever.

2772
02:40:05.64 --> 02:40:07.64
But when it works out,

2773
02:40:07.64 --> 02:40:08.64
like I've had.

2774
02:40:08.64 --> 02:40:10.64
The camera slash blame guy.

2775
02:40:10.64 --> 02:40:11.64
Yeah. Exactly.

2776
02:40:11.64 --> 02:40:15.64
I've had some hunts that I'm so thankful we have for sure.

2777
02:40:15.64 --> 02:40:16.64
For sure.

2778
02:40:16.64 --> 02:40:16.64
You know,

2779
02:40:16.64 --> 02:40:18.64
but there's that.

2780
02:40:18.64 --> 02:40:20.64
It's kind of rough waters out for a while.

2781
02:40:20.64 --> 02:40:21.64
Yeah.

2782
02:40:21.64 --> 02:40:22.64
To get it done.

2783
02:40:22.64 --> 02:40:23.64
It is pretty,

2784
02:40:23.64 --> 02:40:24.64
I mean,

2785
02:40:24.64 --> 02:40:26.64
I have some good footage from last year.

2786
02:40:26.64 --> 02:40:27.64
Yeah.

2787
02:40:27.64 --> 02:40:29.64
The Dudley was with me.

2788
02:40:29.64 --> 02:40:31.64
Dudley was filming.

2789
02:40:31.64 --> 02:40:32.64
You know,

2790
02:40:32.64 --> 02:40:35.64
I'm probably the only person in the world that gets to have John Dudley as my freaky camera.

2791
02:40:35.64 --> 02:40:37.64
I remember he had already killed and he was like,

2792
02:40:37.64 --> 02:40:37.64
right?

2793
02:40:37.64 --> 02:40:38.64
And, you know,

2794
02:40:38.64 --> 02:40:42.64
he got a freaking good video of the,

2795
02:40:42.64 --> 02:40:43.64
you know,

2796
02:40:43.64 --> 02:40:44.64
the end of this.

2797
02:40:44.64 --> 02:40:46.64
I actually got the set up and everything.

2798
02:40:46.64 --> 02:40:46.64
Yeah.

2799
02:40:46.64 --> 02:40:47.64
And it's,

2800
02:40:47.64 --> 02:40:48.64
and I'm really happy.

2801
02:40:48.64 --> 02:40:50.64
And I will say that like,

2802
02:40:50.64 --> 02:40:51.64
like,

2803
02:40:51.64 --> 02:40:53.64
review and tape for anything.

2804
02:40:53.64 --> 02:40:54.64
Like any sport.

2805
02:40:54.64 --> 02:40:55.64
Yeah.

2806
02:40:55.64 --> 02:40:55.64
You know,

2807
02:40:55.64 --> 02:40:56.64
you can watch and be like,

2808
02:40:56.64 --> 02:40:57.64
yeah,

2809
02:40:57.64 --> 02:40:58.64
yeah,

2810
02:40:58.64 --> 02:40:58.64
yeah,

2811
02:40:58.64 --> 02:40:59.64
yeah.

2812
02:40:59.64 --> 02:40:59.64
No,

2813
02:40:59.64 --> 02:41:00.64
I know.

2814
02:41:00.64 --> 02:41:02.64
I remember I think your shot was it,

2815
02:41:02.64 --> 02:41:04.64
was it a little back at the lungs?

2816
02:41:04.64 --> 02:41:05.64
Yep.

2817
02:41:05.64 --> 02:41:06.64
Like we're at one Earth was liver.

2818
02:41:06.64 --> 02:41:07.64
It was like,

2819
02:41:07.64 --> 02:41:08.64
one long,

2820
02:41:08.64 --> 02:41:09.64
one long and liver.

2821
02:41:09.64 --> 02:41:10.64
Yeah.

2822
02:41:10.64 --> 02:41:11.64
I remember that.

2823
02:41:11.64 --> 02:41:11.64
So that's,

2824
02:41:11.64 --> 02:41:15.64
that is good to know because a lot of times it happens super fast.

2825
02:41:15.64 --> 02:41:16.64
Yep.

2826
02:41:16.64 --> 02:41:19.64
So being able to have that footage to review can actually help in the recovery.

2827
02:41:19.64 --> 02:41:23.64
Right before that,

2828
02:41:23.64 --> 02:41:25.64
I had shot another wolf in Colorado.

2829
02:41:25.64 --> 02:41:27.64
And that one,

2830
02:41:27.64 --> 02:41:35.64
I really would have liked to have that on video because I think you can help me with this.

2831
02:41:35.64 --> 02:41:38.64
So the bowl was at 51 yards.

2832
02:41:38.64 --> 02:41:39.64
Mm.

2833
02:41:39.64 --> 02:41:43.64
And I was on my knees.

2834
02:41:43.64 --> 02:41:45.64
And he was walking,

2835
02:41:45.64 --> 02:41:46.64
you know,

2836
02:41:46.64 --> 02:41:48.64
from right to left.

2837
02:41:48.64 --> 02:41:49.64
And

2838
02:41:49.64 --> 02:41:51.64
ordering away a little bit.

2839
02:41:51.64 --> 02:41:53.64
I don't know what's that called.

2840
02:41:53.64 --> 02:41:54.64
Like anything away or something.

2841
02:41:54.64 --> 02:41:55.64
Like this yeah.

2842
02:41:55.64 --> 02:41:56.64
It's slightly squirming.

2843
02:41:56.64 --> 02:41:57.64
Slightly squirming.

2844
02:41:57.64 --> 02:41:58.64
Slightly squirming.

2845
02:41:58.64 --> 02:42:02.64
And so he's squirming away.

2846
02:42:02.64 --> 02:42:03.64
So I thought okay,

2847
02:42:03.64 --> 02:42:06.64
I'm going to aim a little bit back.

2848
02:42:06.64 --> 02:42:09.64
And then I was waiting for him to stop.

2849
02:42:09.64 --> 02:42:10.64
He stopped.

2850
02:42:10.64 --> 02:42:12.64
And so I,

2851
02:42:12.64 --> 02:42:13.64
you know,

2852
02:42:13.64 --> 02:42:14.64
started letting go.

2853
02:42:14.64 --> 02:42:15.64
My era went.

2854
02:42:15.64 --> 02:42:17.64
And it was like,

2855
02:42:17.64 --> 02:42:19.64
he took a step.

2856
02:42:19.64 --> 02:42:20.64
It was,

2857
02:42:20.64 --> 02:42:21.64
this is what happened.

2858
02:42:21.64 --> 02:42:23.64
He was looking at us.

2859
02:42:23.64 --> 02:42:27.56
So I was waiting for him to look away before I let the arrow go.

2860
02:42:27.56 --> 02:42:29.08
So he started to look away.

2861
02:42:29.08 --> 02:42:31.60
I started pulling back, let the arrow go.

2862
02:42:31.60 --> 02:42:33.16
But he wasn't just looking away.

2863
02:42:33.16 --> 02:42:34.56
He was taking a step.

2864
02:42:34.56 --> 02:42:35.40
Yeah.

2865
02:42:35.40 --> 02:42:38.92
So I hit him further back than I wanted to.

2866
02:42:38.92 --> 02:42:41.40
But in reviewing it in my head, I thought,

2867
02:42:41.40 --> 02:42:45.96
OK, so if I'm going to be aiming at a bull,

2868
02:42:45.96 --> 02:42:47.96
I should cheat a little bit in the direction

2869
02:42:47.96 --> 02:42:49.28
that he might take a step.

2870
02:42:49.28 --> 02:42:50.32
Or is that a bad call?

2871
02:42:50.32 --> 02:42:53.96
We would just go with the stationary.

2872
02:42:53.96 --> 02:42:55.28
Yeah, because you don't know for sure.

2873
02:42:55.28 --> 02:42:57.48
So you don't want to cheat, then they don't take a step.

2874
02:42:57.48 --> 02:43:01.12
And then you overthink it almost.

2875
02:43:01.12 --> 02:43:03.88
Yeah, it's hard to predict what they're going to do.

2876
02:43:03.88 --> 02:43:05.76
I mean, I did recover that bull.

2877
02:43:05.76 --> 02:43:12.56
But it took a while and it took some expert tracking to find.

2878
02:43:12.56 --> 02:43:13.64
Again, I was very lucky.

2879
02:43:13.64 --> 02:43:18.12
Yeah, I had Dudley with me in the guide up there helping out.

2880
02:43:18.12 --> 02:43:19.72
But man, they're tough.

2881
02:43:19.72 --> 02:43:26.24
I mean, he went down and up these three hills.

2882
02:43:26.24 --> 02:43:26.84
Yeah.

2883
02:43:26.84 --> 02:43:30.08
That were not fun.

2884
02:43:30.08 --> 02:43:30.96
He wrote a read.

2885
02:43:30.96 --> 02:43:32.04
They're not fun.

2886
02:43:32.04 --> 02:43:35.56
And he had an arrow freaking sticking in him.

2887
02:43:35.56 --> 02:43:37.16
Yeah.

2888
02:43:37.16 --> 02:43:39.68
Yeah.

2889
02:43:39.68 --> 02:43:42.12
It's a, yeah.

2890
02:43:42.12 --> 02:43:46.36
I think almost, I've seen, you know, I talked about my dad

2891
02:43:46.36 --> 02:43:49.56
or whatever, but I'm sure you guys know that that

2892
02:43:49.56 --> 02:43:54.52
will to live is pretty strong, even for humans.

2893
02:43:54.52 --> 02:43:57.80
We're not as tough as animals, but still, people can really

2894
02:43:57.80 --> 02:43:58.92
hold on.

2895
02:43:58.92 --> 02:44:02.000
And it's like, when that life is leaving, like it's so

2896
02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:07.12
an animal or I say anything, I've heard even people say,

2897
02:44:07.12 --> 02:44:08.16
oh, care, but it's easy.

2898
02:44:08.16 --> 02:44:09.16
They die easy.

2899
02:44:09.16 --> 02:44:10.68
And I'm like, I don't know anything.

2900
02:44:10.68 --> 02:44:12.56
It's a dice easy.

2901
02:44:12.56 --> 02:44:13.88
I don't know anything.

2902
02:44:13.88 --> 02:44:17.92
So especially something as tough as a bull elk.

2903
02:44:17.92 --> 02:44:20.80
It does this born and bred in the mountains.

2904
02:44:20.80 --> 02:44:24.16
It's just like they're will to live, just like any things,

2905
02:44:24.16 --> 02:44:27.92
anything that's alive, there's a will to live.

2906
02:44:27.92 --> 02:44:30.32
That is just incredible.

2907
02:44:30.32 --> 02:44:33.64
And they're freaking, like when you said born in the mountains,

2908
02:44:33.64 --> 02:44:36.28
you see them go up a hill.

2909
02:44:36.28 --> 02:44:36.80
Yeah.

2910
02:44:36.80 --> 02:44:37.80
It's insane.

2911
02:44:37.80 --> 02:44:40.000
No, they'll go up and over a ridge.

2912
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.80
You'll try to do the same thing or take you an hour.

2913
02:44:41.80 --> 02:44:42.32
Yeah.

2914
02:44:42.32 --> 02:44:43.16
And they do it in minutes.

2915
02:44:43.16 --> 02:44:44.000
Yeah.

2916
02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:44.68
It's freaking crazy to watch.

2917
02:44:44.68 --> 02:44:45.48
Yeah.

2918
02:44:45.48 --> 02:44:49.000
They're there. But one thing that humans do have

2919
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:52.68
over animals, almost any animal other than maybe a wolf,

2920
02:44:52.68 --> 02:44:54.44
is endurance.

2921
02:44:54.44 --> 02:44:57.64
So those bulls can put distance between you and them

2922
02:44:57.64 --> 02:44:58.84
quickly.

2923
02:44:58.84 --> 02:45:02.48
But if you can stay on, it's hard finding country

2924
02:45:02.48 --> 02:45:05.24
that would allow this.

2925
02:45:05.24 --> 02:45:07.40
But that's like an African that's what they do.

2926
02:45:07.40 --> 02:45:09.12
They stay on these animals.

2927
02:45:09.12 --> 02:45:10.000
And then they get it.

2928
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.08
Animals get exhausted before the humans do.

2929
02:45:12.08 --> 02:45:15.36
So we have endurance, as that's

2930
02:45:15.36 --> 02:45:17.68
our pretty much our only advantage.

2931
02:45:17.68 --> 02:45:18.56
Yeah.

2932
02:45:18.56 --> 02:45:20.88
And I would caveat by saying some humans.

2933
02:45:24.88 --> 02:45:26.04
Maybe not everybody.

2934
02:45:26.04 --> 02:45:27.20
Maybe not the woke ones.

2935
02:45:31.20 --> 02:45:35.52
You got some crazy stories in here.

2936
02:45:35.52 --> 02:45:37.92
Here's a story with Roy in it.

2937
02:45:37.92 --> 02:45:39.76
Roy stared in the face and danger.

2938
02:45:39.76 --> 02:45:41.60
And the face of danger didn't blink.

2939
02:45:41.60 --> 02:45:43.16
This happened during Brown Bear hunt.

2940
02:45:43.16 --> 02:45:46.56
We had gone on earlier in July that year.

2941
02:45:46.56 --> 02:45:50.36
We'd had a big snow, a big sal brown bear that turned into

2942
02:45:50.36 --> 02:45:51.04
a problem.

2943
02:45:51.04 --> 02:45:54.56
She saw us from about 130 yards away and started running full

2944
02:45:54.56 --> 02:45:56.08
speed right at us.

2945
02:45:56.08 --> 02:46:01.24
Roy ready to his three, his dot three, five, seven.

2946
02:46:01.24 --> 02:46:02.52
Gonna get some.

2947
02:46:02.52 --> 02:46:05.96
That he'd brought as backup.

2948
02:46:05.96 --> 02:46:08.28
And I knocked an arrow.

2949
02:46:08.28 --> 02:46:11.24
Not sure what an arrow would do to a charging brown bear.

2950
02:46:11.24 --> 02:46:12.40
But that's all I had.

2951
02:46:12.40 --> 02:46:14.48
Does that say three, five, seven or three, seven, five?

2952
02:46:14.48 --> 02:46:15.68
It says three, seven, five.

2953
02:46:15.68 --> 02:46:16.52
Oh, three, seven, five.

2954
02:46:16.52 --> 02:46:17.16
No, that's right.

2955
02:46:17.16 --> 02:46:17.68
Yeah.

2956
02:46:17.68 --> 02:46:17.68
Yeah.

2957
02:46:17.68 --> 02:46:18.60
No, three, fifty, seven.

2958
02:46:18.60 --> 02:46:20.08
I was like, well, that would be a pistol.

2959
02:46:20.08 --> 02:46:23.04
I was like, I hope that is a three, five, seven.

2960
02:46:23.04 --> 02:46:24.24
Three, seven, five.

2961
02:46:24.24 --> 02:46:24.76
Five, five.

2962
02:46:24.76 --> 02:46:25.64
That's a magnet.

2963
02:46:25.64 --> 02:46:26.96
That's what he had.

2964
02:46:26.96 --> 02:46:27.48
That's a burn.

2965
02:46:27.48 --> 02:46:28.76
They're going to.

2966
02:46:28.76 --> 02:46:33.80
He's Roy said, if she gets to our side of the creek,

2967
02:46:33.80 --> 02:46:34.92
I'm going to have to shoot her.

2968
02:46:34.92 --> 02:46:38.36
She crossed the creek without hesitation and ran toward us.

2969
02:46:38.36 --> 02:46:40.92
At about 20 yards, she stopped and stood up aggressively,

2970
02:46:40.92 --> 02:46:46.20
huffing and staring us down, head rocking side to side.

2971
02:46:46.20 --> 02:46:48.92
We were standing in the wide open in knee high grass,

2972
02:46:48.92 --> 02:46:51.28
so there was no mistake in we were humans.

2973
02:46:51.28 --> 02:46:53.64
We were giving her a chance to make a better decision

2974
02:46:53.64 --> 02:46:56.12
since we didn't want to kill her unless we absolutely had to.

2975
02:46:56.12 --> 02:46:57.84
Get out of here, we hauled.

2976
02:46:57.84 --> 02:46:58.96
It didn't matter.

2977
02:46:58.96 --> 02:47:01.16
The brown bear dropped down.

2978
02:47:01.16 --> 02:47:04.88
And with deadly intentions and ears pinned back,

2979
02:47:04.88 --> 02:47:06.20
she charged.

2980
02:47:06.20 --> 02:47:10.08
Roy fired one shot and stone her at close range.

2981
02:47:10.08 --> 02:47:12.36
Me or feet from us.

2982
02:47:12.36 --> 02:47:14.60
I couldn't help uttering aloud and inappropriate

2983
02:47:14.60 --> 02:47:16.44
cuss word fuck.

2984
02:47:16.44 --> 02:47:19.44
I was mad that we had to kill another bear.

2985
02:47:19.44 --> 02:47:21.32
I had killed a nice bore already,

2986
02:47:21.32 --> 02:47:23.56
and we were on a high after that awesome success

2987
02:47:23.56 --> 02:47:25.92
and sweet footage of my perfect bow shot.

2988
02:47:25.92 --> 02:47:29.52
Now we had killed now we had had another killed,

2989
02:47:29.52 --> 02:47:30.88
which we didn't want.

2990
02:47:30.88 --> 02:47:33.52
Despite the fact that we were in grave danger,

2991
02:47:33.52 --> 02:47:36.08
that aspect never even entered our minds.

2992
02:47:36.08 --> 02:47:38.56
After I cost mad shaking my head,

2993
02:47:38.56 --> 02:47:41.84
Roy said matter of fact, dude, I had to.

2994
02:47:41.84 --> 02:47:44.24
I replied, I know, it just sucks.

2995
02:47:44.24 --> 02:47:45.64
A typical response might have been,

2996
02:47:45.64 --> 02:47:47.20
oh my God, we could have been killed.

2997
02:47:47.20 --> 02:47:48.80
Are you okay? I'm shaking.

2998
02:47:48.80 --> 02:47:51.44
But I knew I had a partner, but I knew the partner I had

2999
02:47:51.44 --> 02:47:52.28
in Roy.

3000
02:47:52.28 --> 02:47:54.60
He shared the same type of confidence I had.

3001
02:47:54.60 --> 02:47:57.28
He was never rattled and always in control.

3002
02:47:57.28 --> 02:47:58.52
I knew in 10 lifetimes,

3003
02:47:58.52 --> 02:48:00.80
I'd never find another partner like Roy.

3004
02:48:00.80 --> 02:48:02.72
Good times.

3005
02:48:02.72 --> 02:48:05.80
Yeah, that was a bummer.

3006
02:48:05.80 --> 02:48:08.80
She had these full grown cobs with her,

3007
02:48:08.80 --> 02:48:10.80
so they'll stick around sometimes.

3008
02:48:10.80 --> 02:48:13.80
They don't need to be with the south,

3009
02:48:13.80 --> 02:48:16.80
but they hang around for a while before they split off.

3010
02:48:16.80 --> 02:48:18.80
So she had those with her,

3011
02:48:18.80 --> 02:48:20.80
and I don't know what it was,

3012
02:48:20.80 --> 02:48:23.80
but I shot this bore,

3013
02:48:23.80 --> 02:48:25.80
and she had heard something.

3014
02:48:25.80 --> 02:48:27.80
I think maybe when the arrow hit,

3015
02:48:27.80 --> 02:48:30.80
and she had heard something, I think maybe when the arrow hit him,

3016
02:48:30.80 --> 02:48:32.80
he made a noise,

3017
02:48:32.80 --> 02:48:34.80
because she had her those full grown cobs,

3018
02:48:34.80 --> 02:48:35.80
and it was a bore,

3019
02:48:35.80 --> 02:48:37.80
boars will kill cobs.

3020
02:48:37.80 --> 02:48:40.80
And so she heard that noise didn't know what,

3021
02:48:40.80 --> 02:48:44.80
so she came over and then smelled blood from my bear.

3022
02:48:44.80 --> 02:48:47.80
Track that blood all the way out to where he died

3023
02:48:47.80 --> 02:48:49.80
and started tearing them up.

3024
02:48:49.80 --> 02:48:53.80
She was attacking them and hair and stuff as you want everywhere.

3025
02:48:53.80 --> 02:48:56.80
And I'm like, I go, dude, she's tearing up my bear.

3026
02:48:56.80 --> 02:48:58.80
And so we're yelling at her,

3027
02:48:58.80 --> 02:49:00.80
and I go, I said shoot out there,

3028
02:49:00.80 --> 02:49:01.80
not to shoot her,

3029
02:49:01.80 --> 02:49:02.80
but just shoot out there,

3030
02:49:02.80 --> 02:49:04.80
spooker, so he shoots nothing.

3031
02:49:04.80 --> 02:49:07.80
And she didn't pay attention.

3032
02:49:07.80 --> 02:49:10.80
Then she turned and looked and she saw us,

3033
02:49:10.80 --> 02:49:12.80
and we're about 130 yards away,

3034
02:49:12.80 --> 02:49:14.80
and she just came just sprinting.

3035
02:49:14.80 --> 02:49:17.80
And it's like a bear, a big brown bear,

3036
02:49:17.80 --> 02:49:19.80
I'd like to sprint into the grass at you,

3037
02:49:19.80 --> 02:49:20.80
it's just like,

3038
02:49:20.80 --> 02:49:22.80
you're knocking up at her,

3039
02:49:22.80 --> 02:49:23.80
yeah, I'm like,

3040
02:49:23.80 --> 02:49:25.80
I don't know what I'll do,

3041
02:49:25.80 --> 02:49:28.80
and so we didn't want to kill her at all.

3042
02:49:28.80 --> 02:49:31.80
And it was just like the biggest downer.

3043
02:49:31.80 --> 02:49:33.80
And even when I was in this video,

3044
02:49:33.80 --> 02:49:35.80
I think it's still on YouTube,

3045
02:49:35.80 --> 02:49:38.80
but I'm sitting there with a bull-eye kill

3046
02:49:38.80 --> 02:49:40.80
and Roy is in the background.

3047
02:49:40.80 --> 02:49:42.80
He's like looking, because those full-grown cubs,

3048
02:49:42.80 --> 02:49:43.80
they're still 400 pounds,

3049
02:49:43.80 --> 02:49:46.80
they're not really cubs, they're yearlings.

3050
02:49:46.80 --> 02:49:49.80
But they're back and forth,

3051
02:49:49.80 --> 02:49:50.80
and he's looking at him,

3052
02:49:50.80 --> 02:49:51.80
he's just shaking his head,

3053
02:49:51.80 --> 02:49:52.80
because it was just,

3054
02:49:52.80 --> 02:49:54.80
you know, they obviously were going to survive.

3055
02:49:54.80 --> 02:49:56.80
They're all going to survive,

3056
02:49:56.80 --> 02:49:58.80
but it was just a downer.

3057
02:49:58.80 --> 02:50:01.80
We're not trying to kill us out, you know?

3058
02:50:01.80 --> 02:50:04.80
And we end up a calling fishing game

3059
02:50:04.80 --> 02:50:06.80
on the satellite phone saying what happened,

3060
02:50:06.80 --> 02:50:08.80
which happens a lot up there.

3061
02:50:08.80 --> 02:50:10.80
It's called defensive life and property.

3062
02:50:10.80 --> 02:50:13.80
You can kill bear if your life's at risk.

3063
02:50:13.80 --> 02:50:15.80
And we had to skin it out and take it back in

3064
02:50:15.80 --> 02:50:17.80
and do the paperwork and do all that.

3065
02:50:17.80 --> 02:50:18.80
So we did all that,

3066
02:50:18.80 --> 02:50:20.80
but it's not that it was,

3067
02:50:20.80 --> 02:50:22.80
you know, legal or anything like that.

3068
02:50:22.80 --> 02:50:25.80
It was all legal, but it's just,

3069
02:50:25.80 --> 02:50:27.80
we just didn't want to have to kill another bear.

3070
02:50:27.80 --> 02:50:31.80
But, yeah, we were in those situations quite often,

3071
02:50:31.80 --> 02:50:32.80
which happens, you know?

3072
02:50:32.80 --> 02:50:35.80
They say, we have a greater chance of,

3073
02:50:35.80 --> 02:50:37.80
who knows what, getting struck by lightning,

3074
02:50:37.80 --> 02:50:39.80
they've been attacked by grizzly.

3075
02:50:39.80 --> 02:50:41.80
Not if you're hunting grizzly all the time.

3076
02:50:41.80 --> 02:50:42.80
If you're hunting grizzly all the time,

3077
02:50:42.80 --> 02:50:44.80
it's like 75% chance.

3078
02:50:44.80 --> 02:50:45.80
You're going to get attacked.

3079
02:50:45.80 --> 02:50:47.80
So we were used to it,

3080
02:50:47.80 --> 02:50:50.80
but it's still, you know, it's pretty intense.

3081
02:50:50.80 --> 02:50:53.80
Yeah, the bears,

3082
02:50:53.80 --> 02:50:58.80
their bears are psycho.

3083
02:50:58.80 --> 02:51:01.80
Is that a accurate statement?

3084
02:51:01.80 --> 02:51:04.80
Yeah, grizzlies have a different,

3085
02:51:04.80 --> 02:51:06.80
although that's a brown bear,

3086
02:51:06.80 --> 02:51:08.80
which is, you know, a grizzly too,

3087
02:51:08.80 --> 02:51:11.80
but so I killed another bear up there.

3088
02:51:11.80 --> 02:51:13.80
There's a limit, there's so many brown bears,

3089
02:51:13.80 --> 02:51:15.80
and non-risen can kill too.

3090
02:51:15.80 --> 02:51:17.80
But we had this bait set up,

3091
02:51:17.80 --> 02:51:19.80
which was legal this year,

3092
02:51:19.80 --> 02:51:21.80
that we were hunting is 2015.

3093
02:51:21.80 --> 02:51:24.80
And the black bear would come in,

3094
02:51:24.80 --> 02:51:26.80
and they would just be pretty docile,

3095
02:51:26.80 --> 02:51:29.80
not wound up at all, pretty relaxed.

3096
02:51:29.80 --> 02:51:32.80
Then a, like, the big bore that I killed,

3097
02:51:32.80 --> 02:51:35.80
the brown bear, not that I wanted to describe there,

3098
02:51:35.80 --> 02:51:36.80
but a different one.

3099
02:51:36.80 --> 02:51:39.80
It would come in, and it'd just be rocking back and forth,

3100
02:51:39.80 --> 02:51:41.80
just like, kind of like possessed.

3101
02:51:41.80 --> 02:51:43.80
And it looked like a dinosaur,

3102
02:51:43.80 --> 02:51:46.80
because it was nine foot six tall, you know,

3103
02:51:46.80 --> 02:51:48.80
it's just a, but on all four,

3104
02:51:48.80 --> 02:51:51.80
so it looked really tall and rocking.

3105
02:51:51.80 --> 02:51:53.80
And just like scanning all around,

3106
02:51:53.80 --> 02:51:55.80
and you're just like, oh my God, this thing isn't saying.

3107
02:51:55.80 --> 02:51:57.80
Yeah, they seem like psychos.

3108
02:51:57.80 --> 02:51:58.80
Yeah, yeah, they,

3109
02:51:58.80 --> 02:52:01.80
and they killed their babies, and they were so, so, so, so.

3110
02:52:01.80 --> 02:52:06.80
And they're freaking huge and so strong.

3111
02:52:06.80 --> 02:52:13.80
All right, I'm gonna fast forward a little bit.

3112
02:52:13.80 --> 02:52:15.80
I was in Colorado bow hunting with Kip,

3113
02:52:15.80 --> 02:52:18.80
and I was in the Fox and Mark Womack.

3114
02:52:18.80 --> 02:52:21.80
I spotted and stalked a big Colorado white tail.

3115
02:52:21.80 --> 02:52:23.80
I hustled toward the buck as quietly as possible.

3116
02:52:23.80 --> 02:52:25.80
He saw something a few times,

3117
02:52:25.80 --> 02:52:27.80
but I was staying pretty low, crawling mostly.

3118
02:52:27.80 --> 02:52:30.80
We figured he thought it was another buck.

3119
02:52:30.80 --> 02:52:32.80
So while I closed in on him,

3120
02:52:32.80 --> 02:52:34.80
he started coming my way.

3121
02:52:34.80 --> 02:52:35.80
He came pretty fast,

3122
02:52:35.80 --> 02:52:36.80
looking his lips,

3123
02:52:36.80 --> 02:52:39.80
and even stopped to make a scrap in the sage brush at 60 yards.

3124
02:52:39.80 --> 02:52:41.80
He started to skirt me a bit,

3125
02:52:41.80 --> 02:52:42.80
so I figured it was time,

3126
02:52:42.80 --> 02:52:43.80
the shop felt good,

3127
02:52:43.80 --> 02:52:45.80
I touched low,

3128
02:52:45.80 --> 02:52:47.80
and he was ordered to a tiny bit.

3129
02:52:47.80 --> 02:52:49.80
I felt it was good enough to kill him,

3130
02:52:49.80 --> 02:52:51.80
so Mark and I backed out,

3131
02:52:51.80 --> 02:52:54.80
planning to come back at first light to recover him.

3132
02:52:54.80 --> 02:52:56.80
That night before bed,

3133
02:52:56.80 --> 02:52:59.80
we reviewed the footage and concluded dead buck.

3134
02:52:59.80 --> 02:53:00.80
Look like the liver,

3135
02:53:00.80 --> 02:53:01.80
but you never know.

3136
02:53:01.80 --> 02:53:03.80
I climbed into my bed that night

3137
02:53:03.80 --> 02:53:06.80
with excitement and belief that we would find the buck in the morning.

3138
02:53:06.80 --> 02:53:08.80
Sleep wouldn't come.

3139
02:53:08.80 --> 02:53:09.80
However,

3140
02:53:09.80 --> 02:53:10.80
at 11 p.m.,

3141
02:53:10.80 --> 02:53:12.80
myself on ring,

3142
02:53:12.80 --> 02:53:14.80
I was always trace.

3143
02:53:14.80 --> 02:53:15.80
Roy's been in an accident,

3144
02:53:15.80 --> 02:53:16.80
she told me.

3145
02:53:16.80 --> 02:53:19.80
She didn't know all the details about what had happened,

3146
02:53:19.80 --> 02:53:22.80
so I knew I needed to call Jill Roy's wife.

3147
02:53:22.80 --> 02:53:25.80
I phoned her and asked what was going on.

3148
02:53:25.80 --> 02:53:27.80
After a long pause, Jill said,

3149
02:53:27.80 --> 02:53:31.80
Cam, Roy's not coming home.

3150
02:53:31.80 --> 02:53:33.80
Jill's voice sounded soft,

3151
02:53:33.80 --> 02:53:34.80
and tired.

3152
02:53:34.80 --> 02:53:36.80
I asked what do you mean?

3153
02:53:36.80 --> 02:53:37.80
She said,

3154
02:53:37.80 --> 02:53:38.80
he fell,

3155
02:53:38.80 --> 02:53:40.80
he passed away.

3156
02:53:40.80 --> 02:53:42.80
My stomach dropped,

3157
02:53:42.80 --> 02:53:45.80
and the darkness of the old farmhouse kitchen I stood in,

3158
02:53:45.80 --> 02:53:46.80
there in the middle of nowhere,

3159
02:53:46.80 --> 02:53:49.80
Colorado felt darker and lonely.

3160
02:53:49.80 --> 02:53:52.80
I couldn't believe her words.

3161
02:53:52.80 --> 02:53:53.80
Right away,

3162
02:53:53.80 --> 02:53:54.80
I found out their children,

3163
02:53:54.80 --> 02:53:57.80
Taylor and Justin and Ellen.

3164
02:53:57.80 --> 02:53:59.80
Roy had fallen 700 feet from a cliff

3165
02:53:59.80 --> 02:54:02.80
in the nasty country we hunted sheep in.

3166
02:54:02.80 --> 02:54:05.80
He was on Pioneer Peak,

3167
02:54:05.80 --> 02:54:07.80
the exact same mountain

3168
02:54:07.80 --> 02:54:10.80
where I had killed my ram in 2008,

3169
02:54:10.80 --> 02:54:13.80
and where Roy had killed ram since.

3170
02:54:13.80 --> 02:54:16.80
Now, in 2015,

3171
02:54:16.80 --> 02:54:19.80
the mountain had won.

3172
02:54:26.80 --> 02:54:28.80
In this chapter,

3173
02:54:28.80 --> 02:54:29.80
the book is called,

3174
02:54:29.80 --> 02:54:32.80
Legends Never Die.

3175
02:54:32.80 --> 02:54:34.80
Hmm.

3176
02:54:34.80 --> 02:54:38.80
Yeah, I have a hard time even thinking about this

3177
02:54:38.80 --> 02:54:42.80
still without getting choked up.

3178
02:54:42.80 --> 02:54:48.80
There's people that come in your life

3179
02:54:48.80 --> 02:54:49.80
that,

3180
02:54:49.80 --> 02:54:51.80
I don't know,

3181
02:54:51.80 --> 02:54:53.80
he's just one of those guys who I always believed in me.

3182
02:54:53.80 --> 02:54:54.80
And we had,

3183
02:54:54.80 --> 02:54:56.80
you know,

3184
02:54:56.80 --> 02:54:57.80
it's like a bond,

3185
02:54:57.80 --> 02:54:59.80
you go through hard things with people,

3186
02:54:59.80 --> 02:55:00.80
and I know it's,

3187
02:55:00.80 --> 02:55:02.80
and I can imagine it's like this with the military

3188
02:55:02.80 --> 02:55:04.80
where you have,

3189
02:55:04.80 --> 02:55:05.80
you just like a brotherhood,

3190
02:55:05.80 --> 02:55:06.80
you know,

3191
02:55:06.80 --> 02:55:08.80
because of what you've went through.

3192
02:55:08.80 --> 02:55:10.80
And that's how it was with,

3193
02:55:10.80 --> 02:55:12.80
with Roy and I in that,

3194
02:55:12.80 --> 02:55:14.80
in that regard.

3195
02:55:14.80 --> 02:55:16.80
So yeah.

3196
02:55:16.80 --> 02:55:17.80
I don't know.

3197
02:55:17.80 --> 02:55:18.80
We have a lot of,

3198
02:55:18.80 --> 02:55:19.80
a lot of big plans,

3199
02:55:19.80 --> 02:55:21.80
a lot of things were going good for us,

3200
02:55:21.80 --> 02:55:23.80
that we talked about and dreamed about

3201
02:55:23.80 --> 02:55:24.80
for our whole lives,

3202
02:55:24.80 --> 02:55:25.80
you know,

3203
02:55:25.80 --> 02:55:27.80
he's becoming an outfitter up there.

3204
02:55:27.80 --> 02:55:28.80
He's,

3205
02:55:28.80 --> 02:55:30.80
like a legend up there,

3206
02:55:30.80 --> 02:55:32.80
and people would talk about Roy,

3207
02:55:32.80 --> 02:55:33.80
and a,

3208
02:55:33.80 --> 02:55:34.80
and a lask.

3209
02:55:34.80 --> 02:55:35.80
It's hard to be legend,

3210
02:55:35.80 --> 02:55:36.80
a legend in a lask.

3211
02:55:36.80 --> 02:55:38.80
There's a lot of legendary people,

3212
02:55:38.80 --> 02:55:40.80
but he was earning that name,

3213
02:55:40.80 --> 02:55:42.80
and so yeah,

3214
02:55:42.80 --> 02:55:44.80
felt,

3215
02:55:44.80 --> 02:55:45.80
I don't know,

3216
02:55:45.80 --> 02:55:46.80
still feels,

3217
02:55:46.80 --> 02:55:47.80
I mean,

3218
02:55:47.80 --> 02:55:49.80
I'm still upset about it,

3219
02:55:49.80 --> 02:55:51.80
still mad,

3220
02:55:51.80 --> 02:55:52.80
because,

3221
02:55:52.80 --> 02:55:53.80
you know,

3222
02:55:53.80 --> 02:55:56.80
we had so much left to do.

3223
02:55:56.80 --> 02:55:57.80
Yeah.

3224
02:55:57.80 --> 02:55:59.80
I know a lot of times you'll,

3225
02:55:59.80 --> 02:56:00.80
you know,

3226
02:56:00.80 --> 02:56:01.80
you're talking about the military,

3227
02:56:01.80 --> 02:56:02.80
aspect of things,

3228
02:56:02.80 --> 02:56:03.80
and I mean,

3229
02:56:03.80 --> 02:56:05.80
I still post pictures of my friend,

3230
02:56:05.80 --> 02:56:06.80
that I've lost,

3231
02:56:06.80 --> 02:56:09.80
and I can tell by what you write that,

3232
02:56:09.80 --> 02:56:11.80
he still is pushing you,

3233
02:56:11.80 --> 02:56:13.80
even though he's not here,

3234
02:56:13.80 --> 02:56:14.80
and you know,

3235
02:56:14.80 --> 02:56:15.80
you can go a little bit further,

3236
02:56:15.80 --> 02:56:18.80
and you can be a little bit more Roy tough,

3237
02:56:18.80 --> 02:56:19.80
as,

3238
02:56:19.80 --> 02:56:20.80
as you put some of those things,

3239
02:56:20.80 --> 02:56:22.80
and that's the same thing I think about,

3240
02:56:22.80 --> 02:56:23.80
you know,

3241
02:56:23.80 --> 02:56:24.80
the same thing,

3242
02:56:24.80 --> 02:56:25.80
the same thing,

3243
02:56:25.80 --> 02:56:26.80
hey,

3244
02:56:26.80 --> 02:56:27.80
you know,

3245
02:56:27.80 --> 02:56:29.80
the same thing,

3246
02:56:29.80 --> 02:56:29.80
hey,

3247
02:56:29.80 --> 02:56:30.80
I mean,

3248
02:56:30.80 --> 02:56:32.80
I got guys that died,

3249
02:56:32.80 --> 02:56:34.80
when they were way too young,

3250
02:56:34.80 --> 02:56:35.80
way too young,

3251
02:56:35.80 --> 02:56:36.80
yeah,

3252
02:56:36.80 --> 02:56:38.80
and they don't have the opportunity

3253
02:56:38.80 --> 02:56:41.80
to carry on,

3254
02:56:41.80 --> 02:56:42.80
and the opportunity that,

3255
02:56:42.80 --> 02:56:44.80
to do the things that I get to do right now,

3256
02:56:44.80 --> 02:56:47.80
and even if that thing is just getting up in the morning,

3257
02:56:47.80 --> 02:56:48.80
and going for a workout,

3258
02:56:48.80 --> 02:56:49.80
like,

3259
02:56:49.80 --> 02:56:51.80
that's a gift,

3260
02:56:51.80 --> 02:56:52.80
you know,

3261
02:56:52.80 --> 02:56:54.80
hmm.

3262
02:56:54.80 --> 02:56:54.80
Well,

3263
02:56:54.80 --> 02:56:55.80
I wouldn't,

3264
02:56:55.80 --> 02:56:56.80
Roy started moving,

3265
02:56:56.80 --> 02:56:57.80
I mean,

3266
02:56:57.80 --> 02:56:58.80
I wouldn't be here.

3267
02:56:58.80 --> 02:56:59.80
It's like,

3268
02:56:59.80 --> 02:57:00.80
normally,

3269
02:57:00.80 --> 02:57:01.80
after I would do something like this,

3270
02:57:01.80 --> 02:57:04.80
I would call Roy,

3271
02:57:04.80 --> 02:57:05.80
and we,

3272
02:57:05.80 --> 02:57:05.80
you know,

3273
02:57:05.80 --> 02:57:06.80
this is,

3274
02:57:06.80 --> 02:57:08.80
this is all part of our thing,

3275
02:57:08.80 --> 02:57:10.80
or we did it.

3276
02:57:10.80 --> 02:57:11.80
And,

3277
02:57:11.80 --> 02:57:12.80
you know,

3278
02:57:12.80 --> 02:57:13.80
that's,

3279
02:57:13.80 --> 02:57:14.80
that's a reason why,

3280
02:57:14.80 --> 02:57:15.80
I mean,

3281
02:57:15.80 --> 02:57:17.80
I picked that picture on the cover of the book,

3282
02:57:17.80 --> 02:57:18.80
that's from our last hunt,

3283
02:57:18.80 --> 02:57:20.80
and it was a moose hunt,

3284
02:57:20.80 --> 02:57:22.80
two weeks before we died,

3285
02:57:22.80 --> 02:57:23.80
and,

3286
02:57:23.80 --> 02:57:25.80
you know,

3287
02:57:25.80 --> 02:57:26.80
you know,

3288
02:57:26.80 --> 02:57:27.80
I mean,

3289
02:57:27.80 --> 02:57:28.80
it's just,

3290
02:57:28.80 --> 02:57:29.80
you got to get by,

3291
02:57:29.80 --> 02:57:30.80
you got to,

3292
02:57:30.80 --> 02:57:30.80
you know,

3293
02:57:30.80 --> 02:57:31.80
if you want to,

3294
02:57:31.80 --> 02:57:33.80
they say it might be cliche,

3295
02:57:33.80 --> 02:57:34.80
but you know,

3296
02:57:34.80 --> 02:57:36.80
people die twice when they,

3297
02:57:36.80 --> 02:57:37.80
when they're life ends,

3298
02:57:37.80 --> 02:57:40.80
and then the last time somebody mentions their name.

3299
02:57:40.80 --> 02:57:42.80
And so,

3300
02:57:42.80 --> 02:57:44.80
just like you bring up the guys that,

3301
02:57:44.80 --> 02:57:45.80
you know,

3302
02:57:45.80 --> 02:57:46.80
that you've lost.

3303
02:57:46.80 --> 02:57:48.80
I'm always going to honor Roy.

3304
02:57:48.80 --> 02:57:50.80
I'm doing it right now.

3305
02:57:50.80 --> 02:57:51.80
This is what I'm doing.

3306
02:57:51.80 --> 02:57:53.80
I'm doing it in the book,

3307
02:57:53.80 --> 02:57:55.80
because without him,

3308
02:57:55.80 --> 02:57:56.80
I wouldn't be here,

3309
02:57:56.80 --> 02:57:57.80
and,

3310
02:57:57.80 --> 02:57:59.80
so,

3311
02:57:59.80 --> 02:58:01.80
I mean,

3312
02:58:01.80 --> 02:58:02.80
yeah,

3313
02:58:02.80 --> 02:58:03.80
it's just,

3314
02:58:03.80 --> 02:58:04.80
it's tough.

3315
02:58:04.80 --> 02:58:05.80
I mean,

3316
02:58:05.80 --> 02:58:06.80
I still,

3317
02:58:06.80 --> 02:58:08.80
I'm still in contact with Jill all the time,

3318
02:58:08.80 --> 02:58:10.80
and,

3319
02:58:10.80 --> 02:58:11.80
yeah,

3320
02:58:11.80 --> 02:58:12.80
just,

3321
02:58:12.80 --> 02:58:13.80
I don't know,

3322
02:58:13.80 --> 02:58:14.80
life changing.

3323
02:58:14.80 --> 02:58:15.80
Yeah.

3324
02:58:15.80 --> 02:58:18.80
And again,

3325
02:58:18.80 --> 02:58:22.80
you put so many cool stories and details about all that,

3326
02:58:22.80 --> 02:58:23.80
that,

3327
02:58:23.80 --> 02:58:24.80
this is another reason,

3328
02:58:24.80 --> 02:58:25.80
just to,

3329
02:58:25.80 --> 02:58:27.80
to get the book and learn some of those things,

3330
02:58:27.80 --> 02:58:30.80
and keep saying that name.

3331
02:58:30.80 --> 02:58:32.80
I want to close out,

3332
02:58:32.80 --> 02:58:33.80
you know,

3333
02:58:33.80 --> 02:58:34.80
obviously,

3334
02:58:34.80 --> 02:58:35.80
I'm not reading the whole book,

3335
02:58:35.80 --> 02:58:37.80
but I just want to close out with one,

3336
02:58:37.80 --> 02:58:39.80
one section here.

3337
02:58:39.80 --> 02:58:41.80
Towards the end of the book,

3338
02:58:41.80 --> 02:58:42.80
you say,

3339
02:58:42.80 --> 02:58:43.80
many years ago,

3340
02:58:43.80 --> 02:58:47.80
I decided I was going to work hard every day on being the very best bow hunter I could be.

3341
02:58:47.80 --> 02:58:49.80
Along with taking care of my family,

3342
02:58:49.80 --> 02:58:50.80
that is my purpose in life.

3343
02:58:50.80 --> 02:58:51.80
Everything I do is prioritized,

3344
02:58:51.80 --> 02:58:53.80
I've been as prioritized around this drive and this dream.

3345
02:58:53.80 --> 02:58:57.80
I started 5am and finish at APM every day.

3346
02:58:57.80 --> 02:58:58.80
I give it my best.

3347
02:58:58.80 --> 02:59:01.80
I have gratitude for the gifts and opportunities I'm given.

3348
02:59:01.80 --> 02:59:03.80
I enjoy the journey.

3349
02:59:03.80 --> 02:59:05.80
Steve Prefontane was right.

3350
02:59:05.80 --> 02:59:09.80
To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.

3351
02:59:09.80 --> 02:59:11.80
That's exactly how I look at it.

3352
02:59:11.80 --> 02:59:13.80
Bow hunting can be a struggle.

3353
02:59:13.80 --> 02:59:15.80
It's hard and very competitive.

3354
02:59:15.80 --> 02:59:17.80
It can be very cut throat.

3355
02:59:17.80 --> 02:59:19.80
But so can life.

3356
02:59:19.80 --> 02:59:22.80
Life can be tough and beat us down.

3357
02:59:22.80 --> 02:59:23.80
We experience loss.

3358
02:59:23.80 --> 02:59:27.80
I loved one or a family member or a job or a dream.

3359
02:59:27.80 --> 02:59:30.80
We battle our own demons and dependencies.

3360
02:59:30.80 --> 02:59:34.80
We all take hits and get beaten down.

3361
02:59:34.80 --> 02:59:37.80
That's when we have choices to make.

3362
02:59:37.80 --> 02:59:40.80
Only you can choose not to hesitate.

3363
02:59:40.80 --> 02:59:42.80
Only you can keep moving.

3364
02:59:42.80 --> 02:59:45.80
Only you can climb over snow and ice.

3365
02:59:45.80 --> 02:59:48.80
And tough footing and steep rugged country.

3366
02:59:48.80 --> 02:59:52.80
What dream do you hold that you're not going to let go of?

3367
02:59:52.80 --> 02:59:55.80
If I can do it, anyone can.

3368
02:59:55.80 --> 02:59:57.80
But you will have to earn it.

3369
02:59:57.80 --> 02:59:59.80
You will have to endure.

3370
02:59:59.80 --> 03:00:02.80
You will have to keep hammering.

3371
03:00:02.80 --> 03:00:17.80
So again, if you're listening to this, get the book.

3372
03:00:17.80 --> 03:00:21.80
Let's make this thing a freaking best seller.

3373
03:00:21.80 --> 03:00:29.80
Just to spite the people that don't want this book to be a best seller.

3374
03:00:29.80 --> 03:00:30.80
So many things.

3375
03:00:30.80 --> 03:00:33.80
And there's like I said, there's a bunch of things that I didn't cover here.

3376
03:00:33.80 --> 03:00:37.80
And as you've said about the book, it's, and it clearly isn't.

3377
03:00:37.80 --> 03:00:39.80
It's not just about bow hunting.

3378
03:00:39.80 --> 03:00:41.80
It's not just about bow hunting.

3379
03:00:41.80 --> 03:00:42.80
It's about life.

3380
03:00:42.80 --> 03:00:45.80
And it's going to do a ton of things to help people.

3381
03:00:45.80 --> 03:00:49.80
Get through whatever they're getting through and be on the right path in their lives.

3382
03:00:49.80 --> 03:00:53.80
Some of the things we didn't cover in this book, I just wanted to keep hammering.

3383
03:00:53.80 --> 03:01:01.80
So you, according to the book, you do talk about this, but Bob From, who's a San Diego kind of legend,

3384
03:01:01.80 --> 03:01:03.80
archery guy Hunter.

3385
03:01:03.80 --> 03:01:05.80
He runs performance archery here in San Diego.

3386
03:01:05.80 --> 03:01:07.80
And he used to call you cam the hammer.

3387
03:01:07.80 --> 03:01:09.80
Is that what that originated from?

3388
03:01:09.80 --> 03:01:10.80
Yeah.

3389
03:01:10.80 --> 03:01:11.80
You know Bob?

3390
03:01:11.80 --> 03:01:12.80
Yeah.

3391
03:01:12.80 --> 03:01:17.80
How he's charismatic and always just talk in is kind of cool.

3392
03:01:17.80 --> 03:01:22.80
So he would say, you know, call me and say, hey, what's up cam the hammer?

3393
03:01:22.80 --> 03:01:25.80
So just him.

3394
03:01:25.80 --> 03:01:27.80
He was kind of a legend to me too.

3395
03:01:27.80 --> 03:01:30.80
He was on a magazine called Western Bow Hunter.

3396
03:01:30.80 --> 03:01:32.80
And he's seemed like he was on the cover all the time.

3397
03:01:32.80 --> 03:01:35.80
And so he made Bow hunting cool.

3398
03:01:35.80 --> 03:01:39.80
So for, yeah, I was going to have a longer hair kind of good looking guys.

3399
03:01:39.80 --> 03:01:43.80
Pretty badass.

3400
03:01:43.80 --> 03:01:48.80
And then you got a section in there, Rogan talking about Rogan.

3401
03:01:48.80 --> 03:01:51.80
How do you meet Rogan originally?

3402
03:01:51.80 --> 03:01:53.80
I don't know. He sent out a tweet.

3403
03:01:53.80 --> 03:01:58.80
So I went to his podcast in 2014 and then I took him a bow.

3404
03:01:58.80 --> 03:02:02.80
And if you know, he almost like once he gets into something, it's all the way.

3405
03:02:02.80 --> 03:02:03.80
Right.

3406
03:02:03.80 --> 03:02:04.80
So then I said, well, let's go.

3407
03:02:04.80 --> 03:02:05.80
Let's do a hunt.

3408
03:02:05.80 --> 03:02:08.80
And a good first hunt is a bear hunt because it's usually closed.

3409
03:02:08.80 --> 03:02:11.80
And I could, you know, be there with them.

3410
03:02:11.80 --> 03:02:13.80
And I don't know if I agree with that for.

3411
03:02:13.80 --> 03:02:18.80
Well, it's just that the shot distance isn't less can go wrong.

3412
03:02:18.80 --> 03:02:18.80
Yeah.

3413
03:02:18.80 --> 03:02:19.80
It's adrenaline.

3414
03:02:19.80 --> 03:02:20.80
Yeah.

3415
03:02:20.80 --> 03:02:21.80
I don't know.

3416
03:02:21.80 --> 03:02:23.80
There's a really one major thing that can go wrong.

3417
03:02:23.80 --> 03:02:24.80
Yeah.

3418
03:02:24.80 --> 03:02:25.80
Well, that's yeah.

3419
03:02:25.80 --> 03:02:27.80
That's what the tracking and the wounding and all that.

3420
03:02:27.80 --> 03:02:32.80
But if you do things right, it can be pretty high percentage of chances success.

3421
03:02:32.80 --> 03:02:35.80
So I thought, let's go on a bear hunt.

3422
03:02:35.80 --> 03:02:38.80
And as funny, he killed a bear.

3423
03:02:38.80 --> 03:02:39.80
We got a picture of it.

3424
03:02:39.80 --> 03:02:45.80
And I remember we were up there and I'm like, I go, hey, I put up a post of the picture of you

3425
03:02:45.80 --> 03:02:47.80
and you're, and you're bear.

3426
03:02:47.80 --> 03:02:48.80
And he's like, yeah, no.

3427
03:02:48.80 --> 03:02:52.80
I've heard all about it already because it's like bear.

3428
03:02:52.80 --> 03:02:56.80
And then if you're like a celebrity type and then killing a bear,

3429
03:02:56.80 --> 03:02:58.80
it's like, I thought people think they're endangered.

3430
03:02:58.80 --> 03:03:01.80
You know, because no people think they're windy the pool.

3431
03:03:01.80 --> 03:03:02.80
Yeah.

3432
03:03:02.80 --> 03:03:03.80
Yeah.

3433
03:03:03.80 --> 03:03:05.80
I'm a little bit more endangered or both.

3434
03:03:05.80 --> 03:03:11.80
And so yeah, he was kind of, you know, that's where he really was driven home about hunting

3435
03:03:11.80 --> 03:03:12.80
and animals.

3436
03:03:12.80 --> 03:03:15.80
And there's a negative connotation with it.

3437
03:03:15.80 --> 03:03:18.80
Obviously, people who don't do it or don't understand it.

3438
03:03:18.80 --> 03:03:20.80
Anyway, so that was in 2014.

3439
03:03:20.80 --> 03:03:21.80
Yeah.

3440
03:03:21.80 --> 03:03:24.80
And you, that's another part of the book that we didn't really talk about.

3441
03:03:24.80 --> 03:03:26.80
You explained all that stuff.

3442
03:03:26.80 --> 03:03:32.80
You explained how hunting works and how conservation works and how animal management works.

3443
03:03:32.80 --> 03:03:38.80
And if you just let these animals go, like, there's some species that will get completely wiped out.

3444
03:03:38.80 --> 03:03:40.80
And that'll, off balance everything.

3445
03:03:40.80 --> 03:03:43.80
So all the stuff is so tightly controlled.

3446
03:03:43.80 --> 03:03:44.80
Yeah.

3447
03:03:44.80 --> 03:03:48.80
That it's actually what keeps the environment in balance.

3448
03:03:48.80 --> 03:03:50.80
Well, I saw this very popular.

3449
03:03:50.80 --> 03:03:52.80
He's like kind of an animal rights activist.

3450
03:03:52.80 --> 03:03:54.80
He's got millions of followers.

3451
03:03:54.80 --> 03:04:00.80
He posted this video of this leopard attacking a man in kind of like a city.

3452
03:04:00.80 --> 03:04:01.80
Right?

3453
03:04:01.80 --> 03:04:09.80
He said, you go, see, this is what happens when humans and crotch on animals animal habitat.

3454
03:04:09.80 --> 03:04:10.80
And that's what he said.

3455
03:04:10.80 --> 03:04:12.80
And I'm like, well, no shit.

3456
03:04:12.80 --> 03:04:15.80
That's what we do everywhere.

3457
03:04:15.80 --> 03:04:19.80
That's why animal numbers need to be managed because that's what cities are.

3458
03:04:19.80 --> 03:04:21.80
There used to be animals here.

3459
03:04:21.80 --> 03:04:22.80
Now there's a city.

3460
03:04:22.80 --> 03:04:24.80
So as a city grows, we're approaching.

3461
03:04:24.80 --> 03:04:28.80
So you can't have the same amount of animals that we're here 20 years ago.

3462
03:04:28.80 --> 03:04:29.80
If there's less habitat.

3463
03:04:29.80 --> 03:04:34.80
So that's where that whole balance and the biology and the carrying capacity of land come in.

3464
03:04:34.80 --> 03:04:37.80
But yeah, it's in hunting funds all that.

3465
03:04:37.80 --> 03:04:41.80
That's the key point with there's kind of a catch phrase hunting is conservation.

3466
03:04:41.80 --> 03:04:47.80
Which is because hunting pays for that habitat enhancement in the studies and the welfare of animals.

3467
03:04:47.80 --> 03:04:48.80
Yeah.

3468
03:04:48.80 --> 03:04:52.80
And Jill wrote the forward to this book, which is awesome.

3469
03:04:52.80 --> 03:04:54.80
Did a great job of that.

3470
03:04:54.80 --> 03:05:01.80
You know, like, I guess people sometimes, I guess they make a jealous of Jill Rogan.

3471
03:05:01.80 --> 03:05:07.80
Because he's got so much popularity.

3472
03:05:07.80 --> 03:05:09.80
But man, he's good at shit.

3473
03:05:09.80 --> 03:05:13.80
Like you were just saying, he's freaking good at archery.

3474
03:05:13.80 --> 03:05:14.80
Yeah.

3475
03:05:14.80 --> 03:05:14.80
Yeah.

3476
03:05:14.80 --> 03:05:15.80
Yeah.

3477
03:05:15.80 --> 03:05:16.80
People are like, are you not ready?

3478
03:05:16.80 --> 03:05:17.80
Why do you really know about fighting?

3479
03:05:17.80 --> 03:05:18.80
Dude, that guy fought.

3480
03:05:18.80 --> 03:05:20.80
That guy's a black belt in due jitsu.

3481
03:05:20.80 --> 03:05:24.80
And then they think that doing a podcast is easy.

3482
03:05:24.80 --> 03:05:25.80
Oh, man.

3483
03:05:25.80 --> 03:05:28.80
And doing the way he does a podcast is easy.

3484
03:05:28.80 --> 03:05:32.80
Talking to people off the top of his head for two, three, four, five hours.

3485
03:05:32.80 --> 03:05:34.80
Like crazy.

3486
03:05:34.80 --> 03:05:37.80
Oh, I listen to a lot of shitty podcasts.

3487
03:05:37.80 --> 03:05:40.80
That those people think podcast is easy.

3488
03:05:40.80 --> 03:05:42.80
But Joe does make it seem.

3489
03:05:42.80 --> 03:05:43.80
He does.

3490
03:05:43.80 --> 03:05:47.80
That's so, it's so hard to make a conversation interesting.

3491
03:05:47.80 --> 03:05:51.80
And, you know, the first time I went on there, I'm like, so do you have a,

3492
03:05:51.80 --> 03:05:54.80
we got questions or he's like, no.

3493
03:05:54.80 --> 03:05:55.80
No.

3494
03:05:55.80 --> 03:05:58.80
So he's like, I was like, oh, we're just going to, just going to bullshit.

3495
03:05:58.80 --> 03:06:02.80
Most of time, if guys just sit down just to bullshit, it's going to be awful.

3496
03:06:02.80 --> 03:06:03.80
Yeah.

3497
03:06:03.80 --> 03:06:03.80
Yeah.

3498
03:06:03.80 --> 03:06:04.80
Yeah.

3499
03:06:04.80 --> 03:06:07.80
And people think that other people want to hear you bullshit.

3500
03:06:07.80 --> 03:06:08.80
Yeah.

3501
03:06:08.80 --> 03:06:09.80
Well, if I want to do that, just go to a restaurant.

3502
03:06:09.80 --> 03:06:11.80
Sit in the booth next to you and listen.

3503
03:06:11.80 --> 03:06:13.80
You're talking about freaking going to get grocery shopping dinner.

3504
03:06:13.80 --> 03:06:14.80
Right.

3505
03:06:14.80 --> 03:06:15.80
Because I think that's the best.

3506
03:06:15.80 --> 03:06:20.80
Or usually it's about some kids tea ball coach who Tim, he should be playing more.

3507
03:06:20.80 --> 03:06:22.80
Starting, but it's just whatever.

3508
03:06:22.80 --> 03:06:31.80
How long was it between when you got him a bow and he went hunting for a bear?

3509
03:06:31.80 --> 03:06:32.80
I think.

3510
03:06:32.80 --> 03:06:34.80
I mean, a few months probably.

3511
03:06:34.80 --> 03:06:35.80
Right.

3512
03:06:35.80 --> 03:06:36.80
Yeah.

3513
03:06:36.80 --> 03:06:38.80
I can't remember when I went down there, but we went spring bear hunting.

3514
03:06:38.80 --> 03:06:42.80
So it was about this time of year in 2014, I believe.

3515
03:06:42.80 --> 03:06:43.80
Yeah.

3516
03:06:43.80 --> 03:06:47.80
I can't remember, but a few months, you know, he was confident in shooting.

3517
03:06:47.80 --> 03:06:53.80
You know, because he probably did it 20 hours a day because he's pretty obsessive.

3518
03:06:53.80 --> 03:06:57.80
And now we're actually kind of unified now in a way.

3519
03:06:57.80 --> 03:07:07.80
Because we got you, Joe, Kip, me, Pete Roberts with this new venture, or Jean Hunt,

3520
03:07:07.80 --> 03:07:14.80
making American-made hunting gear clothing.

3521
03:07:14.80 --> 03:07:24.80
That's a kind of big step for you going into founding a company and moving in that direction.

3522
03:07:24.80 --> 03:07:26.80
How's that feel?

3523
03:07:26.80 --> 03:07:27.80
Feels incredible.

3524
03:07:27.80 --> 03:07:34.80
I still feel like the small town guy making $4.72 an hour working part-time at a warehouse.

3525
03:07:34.80 --> 03:07:38.80
And now you say founding a company, it's just again.

3526
03:07:38.80 --> 03:07:40.80
This is all this journey.

3527
03:07:40.80 --> 03:07:45.80
And the whole point to all this, I think, in the book and everything else in my story,

3528
03:07:45.80 --> 03:07:52.80
is that just staying on the path, staying on the path, and over time,

3529
03:07:52.80 --> 03:07:54.80
who knows what's going to happen.

3530
03:07:54.80 --> 03:07:59.80
You couldn't have told me back when I was at Kid Getting Drunken Punch at Parties,

3531
03:07:59.80 --> 03:08:03.80
because I got a smart ass that, do you know someday you're going to be doing this?

3532
03:08:03.80 --> 03:08:07.80
I'd be like, you got to be talking about somebody else.

3533
03:08:07.80 --> 03:08:10.80
Because there's no way, so it seems surreal.

3534
03:08:10.80 --> 03:08:15.80
But you know, you make these relationships in these decisions, and you keep working and working

3535
03:08:15.80 --> 03:08:22.80
and working, and after 30-some years, like this journey has been, who knows what's going to happen.

3536
03:08:22.80 --> 03:08:25.80
And I was thinking about this yesterday as I ran on the beach.

3537
03:08:25.80 --> 03:08:28.80
I saw this kid down there fishing.

3538
03:08:28.80 --> 03:08:32.80
And I'm like, what if this kid, like, I couldn't imagine if I lived in the city,

3539
03:08:32.80 --> 03:08:35.80
I couldn't imagine if I lived here, what would I do?

3540
03:08:35.80 --> 03:08:38.80
What would I have stood out in anything? I don't know.

3541
03:08:38.80 --> 03:08:42.80
But I was one of one of that kid. He's down here fishing by himself.

3542
03:08:42.80 --> 03:08:47.80
And, you know, made the decision to come down on the Saturday morning and hey, let's see what I can do.

3543
03:08:47.80 --> 03:08:53.80
What if that's going to lead him, maybe he's going to be the most well-known fisherman in the world at some point?

3544
03:08:53.80 --> 03:08:58.80
But you can't tell from a glimpse and, you know, when you're young,

3545
03:08:58.80 --> 03:09:00.80
you don't know what your life's going to hold.

3546
03:09:00.80 --> 03:09:04.80
You don't know, you know, then you have kids and you want them to be special in their own right.

3547
03:09:04.80 --> 03:09:07.80
And this all is journey. That's all the book is about.

3548
03:09:07.80 --> 03:09:14.80
It's just like, you know, stay true to yourself, keep working hard, endure, and who knows?

3549
03:09:14.80 --> 03:09:17.80
Next in, you'll have your own line of hunting gear.

3550
03:09:17.80 --> 03:09:22.80
How exciting is that? I mean, you see that how fired up people are?

3551
03:09:22.80 --> 03:09:24.80
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's a maze.

3552
03:09:24.80 --> 03:09:35.80
I'm more excited about it. Because I've been saying, and as I've said every time I talk about this, there's no more patriotic group of people than hunters.

3553
03:09:35.80 --> 03:09:39.80
And hunters don't want to buy stuff that's not made in America.

3554
03:09:39.80 --> 03:09:44.80
Yeah. And they don't really have many options right now. And they're about to have options.

3555
03:09:44.80 --> 03:09:51.80
I mean, I think if anybody could be half as excited as Kip is, that'd be pretty damn good start.

3556
03:09:51.80 --> 03:09:59.80
He's like going through, he's always, you know, loves the videos of trying this stuff on and bending over and talking about the cuts.

3557
03:09:59.80 --> 03:10:02.80
And it's just like, in this guy has, I don't know how much money.

3558
03:10:02.80 --> 03:10:06.80
A lot of money from when under Armour and what public.

3559
03:10:06.80 --> 03:10:11.80
And he doesn't have to do this. So it's like, you know it's just passion.

3560
03:10:11.80 --> 03:10:13.80
And it's what he loves.

3561
03:10:13.80 --> 03:10:17.80
Yeah. And so how could you not be excited for that?

3562
03:10:17.80 --> 03:10:22.80
Yeah. And he doesn't have to do this. And originally he reached out to Pete.

3563
03:10:22.80 --> 03:10:27.80
Just because he saw what we were doing with origin. He saw that we were just making freaking

3564
03:10:27.80 --> 03:10:31.80
Gees, Getsu Gees in America and thought that was cool.

3565
03:10:31.80 --> 03:10:38.80
Yeah. And probably probably also thought, man, I better help these jackass out.

3566
03:10:38.80 --> 03:10:43.80
Because he's, I mean, he has grown up doing that.

3567
03:10:43.80 --> 03:10:51.80
Yeah. Literally from college on. And I mean, when he rattles off kind of the stats of like, you know, I open 38 factory.

3568
03:10:51.80 --> 03:10:54.80
You know, like, he's, I forget what the numbers are, but yeah, it's incredible.

3569
03:10:54.80 --> 03:10:56.80
I mean, think about how big of a company under Armour and it's right.

3570
03:10:56.80 --> 03:11:03.80
And he was, he was running that on the backside for all those years and built it.

3571
03:11:03.80 --> 03:11:07.80
So he's definitely been a huge help to Pete.

3572
03:11:07.80 --> 03:11:14.80
Pete Roberts is the other owner who he's like the manufacturer from our team, you know,

3573
03:11:14.80 --> 03:11:18.80
and he's done an incredible job of build something for the ground up as well.

3574
03:11:18.80 --> 03:11:23.80
And so this, we, so we kind of had the ingredients.

3575
03:11:23.80 --> 03:11:27.80
Well, I mean, we phrase that we had some of the ingredients, right?

3576
03:11:27.80 --> 03:11:33.80
We had, we had Pete who knew how to make stuff in America, right? That's part of the ingredients.

3577
03:11:33.80 --> 03:11:42.80
We knew I, I could get the word out about it. Kip has the, the actual experience to get it done and the design experience,

3578
03:11:42.80 --> 03:11:49.80
but, you know, we needed somebody that was legit that actually could say this is what we need.

3579
03:11:49.80 --> 03:11:56.80
This is how it needs to work and who else, you know, why not just why not just throw a freaking,

3580
03:11:56.80 --> 03:12:03.80
you know, a 200 yard archery shot out. See if we can bullseye, we've pulled it off.

3581
03:12:03.80 --> 03:12:10.80
Well, it's, I mean, it's an honor to be involved for sure because it's, it gives me so much pride just to know and we're doing something that

3582
03:12:10.80 --> 03:12:14.80
could make a difference. You know, it's like that's our whole point to life.

3583
03:12:14.80 --> 03:12:17.80
Is I, what are you doing? This going to make a positive difference.

3584
03:12:17.80 --> 03:12:21.80
And I feel like this is, you know, it's causing a ripple effect.

3585
03:12:21.80 --> 03:12:27.80
And, you know, bringing those videos. It's like, it's like, I saw one the other day,

3586
03:12:27.80 --> 03:12:31.80
Orgen put up and I think it was, is it dacks? Yep.

3587
03:12:31.80 --> 03:12:36.80
And talking about, you know, he feels like he's just a small part of the machine,

3588
03:12:36.80 --> 03:12:41.80
but, but talking about bringing American manufacturing back to America,

3589
03:12:41.80 --> 03:12:46.80
it's, it reminds me, I watched this old series called The Min Who Built America.

3590
03:12:46.80 --> 03:12:49.80
Have you watched it? I have watched a few of those.

3591
03:12:49.80 --> 03:12:54.80
So it reminds me of that. It's like that, that type of effort and that vision

3592
03:12:54.80 --> 03:12:59.80
starts there. Yeah. And it's, when I see those factories in the working and the,

3593
03:12:59.80 --> 03:13:04.80
and the workers and the people and the pride in it and the, and I, like,

3594
03:13:04.80 --> 03:13:12.80
people like Dax, it's like, I don't know, it gives you butterflies almost.

3595
03:13:12.80 --> 03:13:16.80
It's special. Yeah, it really is.

3596
03:13:16.80 --> 03:13:21.80
And it's, um, to Pete's credit.

3597
03:13:21.80 --> 03:13:25.80
Pupika told this was impossible five years ago.

3598
03:13:25.80 --> 03:13:28.80
There's no way we can manufacture geese in America.

3599
03:13:28.80 --> 03:13:33.80
He got told that. Like everyone kind of looked at him like he was kind of crazy.

3600
03:13:33.80 --> 03:13:35.80
And maybe they were right. Yeah.

3601
03:13:35.80 --> 03:13:37.80
Maybe Pete is a little bit crazy. Yeah.

3602
03:13:37.80 --> 03:13:44.80
But, you know, just like you did with our tree, he just kept at it and kept trying to figure out,

3603
03:13:44.80 --> 03:13:48.80
how do you overcome this obstacle? What do you do in this situation?

3604
03:13:48.80 --> 03:13:54.80
How do we get by that? And he built a great foundation and has great knowledge.

3605
03:13:54.80 --> 03:14:00.80
And then you throw someone like, kip into the mix, who's done all that and taking it to the next level.

3606
03:14:00.80 --> 03:14:05.80
Uh, because, you know, Pete's a humble guy. He's not sitting around thinking he has all the answers.

3607
03:14:05.80 --> 03:14:09.80
And so when you throw someone like kip into the mix, who does have,

3608
03:14:09.80 --> 03:14:11.80
he may not have all the answers.

3609
03:14:11.80 --> 03:14:16.80
He's got a lot of them done. You know, from the business side, from the manufacturing side,

3610
03:14:16.80 --> 03:14:20.80
from the design side, he's got like a incredible amount of experience.

3611
03:14:20.80 --> 03:14:25.80
So that's awesome. And then having you to give your guidance,

3612
03:14:25.80 --> 03:14:27.80
which is really what everything's based on.

3613
03:14:27.80 --> 03:14:33.80
It's like, what does this guy want to pre-mear bow hunters in the world?

3614
03:14:33.80 --> 03:14:36.80
What does this guy think this should be like?

3615
03:14:36.80 --> 03:14:40.80
Then let, then we have something special.

3616
03:14:40.80 --> 03:14:44.80
Yeah, it's, well, don't you think that that, like you mentioned Pete and being humble?

3617
03:14:44.80 --> 03:14:48.80
Don't you think that that's a key ingredient to like businesses like this is ego?

3618
03:14:48.80 --> 03:14:52.80
I see ego killing so many great opportunities.

3619
03:14:52.80 --> 03:14:58.80
So the fact that he's humble and like, and says he doesn't, he probably has a lot of the answers.

3620
03:14:58.80 --> 03:15:03.80
But just being open to hearing somebody else, it's so paramount to a successful business.

3621
03:15:03.80 --> 03:15:06.80
I, ego kills so much that could have been special.

3622
03:15:06.80 --> 03:15:07.80
Yeah.

3623
03:15:07.80 --> 03:15:11.80
I mean, obviously I have a leadership consulting company.

3624
03:15:11.80 --> 03:15:15.80
And when people always ask, well, what's that main problem that you see?

3625
03:15:15.80 --> 03:15:17.80
And it is, the main problem that we see is ego.

3626
03:15:17.80 --> 03:15:21.80
You know, I don't want to listen to your plan because I think my plan is better than yours.

3627
03:15:21.80 --> 03:15:24.80
And I don't even want to hear your plan because I think my plan is better than yours.

3628
03:15:24.80 --> 03:15:26.80
That's just all ego.

3629
03:15:26.80 --> 03:15:30.80
And to just be able to say, hey, you know what, can I think, let's try your idea.

3630
03:15:30.80 --> 03:15:32.80
That sounds like it's actually sounds like it's better than mine.

3631
03:15:32.80 --> 03:15:33.80
Let's go with that.

3632
03:15:33.80 --> 03:15:36.80
To have that open mindness is what brings on

3633
03:15:36.80 --> 03:15:37.80
success.

3634
03:15:37.80 --> 03:15:40.80
I mean, it's just like anything else.

3635
03:15:40.80 --> 03:15:44.80
But you know, if you're doing jigset, so when you're like, hey, I already know how to do an arm lock.

3636
03:15:44.80 --> 03:15:50.80
I guarantee you get all in the mat with Dean Lister or Jeff Glover.

3637
03:15:50.80 --> 03:15:54.80
They're going to be like, they're going to be able to teach you something about that arm lock that you did not know.

3638
03:15:54.80 --> 03:15:56.80
This is a move I've done a thousand times.

3639
03:15:56.80 --> 03:15:58.80
I've done it 10,000 times.

3640
03:15:58.80 --> 03:15:59.80
Maybe even a hundred thousand times.

3641
03:15:59.80 --> 03:16:04.80
But if Dean or Jeff or someone that's an expert goes, hey, you should have moved your

3642
03:16:04.80 --> 03:16:06.80
absolute little bit more over here.

3643
03:16:06.80 --> 03:16:07.80
You should have hold the risk like this.

3644
03:16:07.80 --> 03:16:11.80
You're going to learn every time with with with bow hunting.

3645
03:16:11.80 --> 03:16:15.80
You go, oh, well, how do you think we should do this?

3646
03:16:15.80 --> 03:16:16.80
What can I?

3647
03:16:16.80 --> 03:16:17.80
Well, even more important.

3648
03:16:17.80 --> 03:16:20.80
You know, when's the last time you said, you know what?

3649
03:16:20.80 --> 03:16:21.80
I'll be good.

3650
03:16:21.80 --> 03:16:23.80
My shots will hit.

3651
03:16:23.80 --> 03:16:24.80
I shoot enough.

3652
03:16:24.80 --> 03:16:25.80
I don't need to shoot today.

3653
03:16:25.80 --> 03:16:26.80
That's a lack of humility.

3654
03:16:26.80 --> 03:16:27.80
Yeah, never.

3655
03:16:27.80 --> 03:16:28.80
Never happened.

3656
03:16:28.80 --> 03:16:29.80
I'm up.

3657
03:16:29.80 --> 03:16:33.80
But I think it's I do want to say, I mean, having you say those nice things about me is like,

3658
03:16:33.80 --> 03:16:36.80
it seems surreal to me.

3659
03:16:36.80 --> 03:16:43.80
I think the key part is like you say you have this consulting business, but you actually, you live it.

3660
03:16:43.80 --> 03:16:45.80
It's not like you're just a lot.

3661
03:16:45.80 --> 03:16:50.80
I know a lot of people who teach who don't follow that same principle, right?

3662
03:16:50.80 --> 03:16:58.80
So I think that because origin has been set up with this approach about maybe your idea is better.

3663
03:16:58.80 --> 03:16:59.80
Maybe I need to listen to this.

3664
03:16:59.80 --> 03:17:02.80
Maybe, you know, whatever just being collaborative.

3665
03:17:02.80 --> 03:17:04.80
And it's, I mean, this is what happens.

3666
03:17:04.80 --> 03:17:12.80
This is the kind of excitement that's generated in the potential that's there with the right attitude and the key pieces in place.

3667
03:17:12.80 --> 03:17:14.80
But you know, you see it.

3668
03:17:14.80 --> 03:17:16.80
I see the key pieces in place and they don't work.

3669
03:17:16.80 --> 03:17:22.80
They don't work because that there's whatever I guess ego or there's who knows what.

3670
03:17:22.80 --> 03:17:23.80
Yeah.

3671
03:17:23.80 --> 03:17:29.80
Well, you, you, at the term I use you, you have to be able to subordinate your ego, which means you actually have to be able to say, you know what?

3672
03:17:29.80 --> 03:17:33.80
But Pete, but it will go with that.

3673
03:17:33.80 --> 03:17:35.80
That, let's go with that.

3674
03:17:35.80 --> 03:17:39.80
I'm, I'm good and not be like, well, actually, I want to do it my way.

3675
03:17:39.80 --> 03:17:40.80
Yeah.

3676
03:17:40.80 --> 03:17:49.80
And here's the thing, if my way is better, then I should be able to articulate that, right, in a way that you go, yeah, you know what that actually makes sense.

3677
03:17:49.80 --> 03:17:51.80
Yeah, that, yeah, I can't argue with that.

3678
03:17:51.80 --> 03:17:52.80
Cool.

3679
03:17:52.80 --> 03:17:53.80
Let's go forward.

3680
03:17:53.80 --> 03:17:55.80
And that's what you need to do.

3681
03:17:55.80 --> 03:17:57.80
Ideas shouldn't be driven by ego.

3682
03:17:57.80 --> 03:17:59.80
We're driven by what's the best idea, right?

3683
03:17:59.80 --> 03:18:03.80
That's how you make things work and that's how we're going to make the best freaking hunting game in the world.

3684
03:18:03.80 --> 03:18:03.80
Yeah.

3685
03:18:03.80 --> 03:18:05.80
And we're going to make it right here in America.

3686
03:18:05.80 --> 03:18:09.80
And we're going to bring back jobs and we need to teach people skills.

3687
03:18:09.80 --> 03:18:10.80
That's what's amazing.

3688
03:18:10.80 --> 03:18:18.80
Is we are, we have a whole group of people that now have a legitimate skill and they have a career.

3689
03:18:18.80 --> 03:18:19.80
Mm-hmm.

3690
03:18:19.80 --> 03:18:26.80
Some of the people that work for us, they, they already knew this, the skill, but now they're able to use it again, because they're not going to be able to use it again.

3691
03:18:26.80 --> 03:18:28.80
Cause a lot of the factories went overseas and now they're able to use it again.

3692
03:18:28.80 --> 03:18:32.80
Some of these younger folks, they're learning it right now.

3693
03:18:32.80 --> 03:18:37.80
I mean, we got a kid that knows how to make, you know, how to weave material.

3694
03:18:37.80 --> 03:18:39.80
It's, it was a lost art.

3695
03:18:39.80 --> 03:18:44.80
And he grabbed it from, from the last guy that really knew how to do it.

3696
03:18:44.80 --> 03:18:48.80
Lenny who actually died, but that skills been captured now.

3697
03:18:48.80 --> 03:18:52.80
And now you got somebody that's going to, that has a freaking awesome skill and

3698
03:18:52.80 --> 03:18:58.80
contribute into the world and contributing to the economy and contributing to the community and contributing to America.

3699
03:18:58.80 --> 03:19:00.80
Like, how awesome is that?

3700
03:19:00.80 --> 03:19:02.80
Yeah, it's incredible.

3701
03:19:02.80 --> 03:19:04.80
All right.

3702
03:19:04.80 --> 03:19:06.80
Um,

3703
03:19:08.80 --> 03:19:09.80
your family.

3704
03:19:09.80 --> 03:19:11.80
Just real quick.

3705
03:19:11.80 --> 03:19:13.80
I just want to give props to your wife.

3706
03:19:13.80 --> 03:19:15.80
Cread it.

3707
03:19:15.80 --> 03:19:21.80
I feel like, uh, sometimes my wife, you know, my wife and my wife married me or met me when I was an E4.

3708
03:19:21.80 --> 03:19:23.80
And the Navy.

3709
03:19:23.80 --> 03:19:24.80
Mm-hmm.

3710
03:19:24.80 --> 03:19:27.80
I always tell her she married me for my money.

3711
03:19:27.80 --> 03:19:33.80
I think I was making like $22,000 a year or something like that when she met me.

3712
03:19:33.80 --> 03:19:34.80
Yeah.

3713
03:19:34.80 --> 03:19:35.80
No pre-not.

3714
03:19:35.80 --> 03:19:36.80
No pre-not.

3715
03:19:36.80 --> 03:19:37.80
Yeah.

3716
03:19:37.80 --> 03:19:39.80
She didn't want half of that.

3717
03:19:39.80 --> 03:19:42.80
She was a bit of a law for yet, obviously.

3718
03:19:42.80 --> 03:19:44.80
So props to her and then, uh, true it.

3719
03:19:44.80 --> 03:19:46.80
I met your son, true it a few times.

3720
03:19:46.80 --> 03:19:48.80
Um, seems like a stud.

3721
03:19:48.80 --> 03:19:49.80
Yeah.

3722
03:19:49.80 --> 03:19:50.80
I know he broke up.

3723
03:19:50.80 --> 03:19:51.80
I broke up.

3724
03:19:51.80 --> 03:19:52.80
Goggen's pull up record.

3725
03:19:52.80 --> 03:19:53.80
He did.

3726
03:19:53.80 --> 03:19:54.80
Yeah.

3727
03:19:54.80 --> 03:19:55.80
Has Goggen's come back on that yet?

3728
03:19:55.80 --> 03:19:56.80
He hasn't.

3729
03:19:56.80 --> 03:19:57.80
No.

3730
03:19:57.80 --> 03:20:01.80
It's a tough one because it even took Goggen's three times to get it.

3731
03:20:01.80 --> 03:20:02.80
Yeah.

3732
03:20:02.80 --> 03:20:03.80
You know, so it's like your body.

3733
03:20:03.80 --> 03:20:04.80
You might want to do it.

3734
03:20:04.80 --> 03:20:06.80
It doesn't mean your body's going to hold up.

3735
03:20:06.80 --> 03:20:07.80
Yeah.

3736
03:20:07.80 --> 03:20:10.80
That's a tough one with those little, you know, your, your grip and your forearm.

3737
03:20:10.80 --> 03:20:11.80
Small muscle.

3738
03:20:11.80 --> 03:20:13.80
And your, and your hands just get trash.

3739
03:20:13.80 --> 03:20:14.80
Yeah.

3740
03:20:14.80 --> 03:20:15.80
Which one?

3741
03:20:15.80 --> 03:20:16.80
People ask that about seal training.

3742
03:20:16.80 --> 03:20:17.80
Like, it's all mental.

3743
03:20:17.80 --> 03:20:18.80
I'm like, well.

3744
03:20:18.80 --> 03:20:21.80
No, not really.

3745
03:20:21.80 --> 03:20:25.80
Because no matter how bad you want to be able to do that rope climb, and I always use rope climb.

3746
03:20:25.80 --> 03:20:27.80
Because rope climb, yeah.

3747
03:20:27.80 --> 03:20:30.80
Rob climb is there's no gutting through a rope climb.

3748
03:20:30.80 --> 03:20:31.80
Right.

3749
03:20:31.80 --> 03:20:33.80
Like you can gut through.

3750
03:20:33.80 --> 03:20:37.80
You can, you can gut through much more of a rock sack, march.

3751
03:20:37.80 --> 03:20:38.80
Hmm.

3752
03:20:38.80 --> 03:20:39.80
Like part of that.

3753
03:20:39.80 --> 03:20:40.80
Oh, cuckoo.

3754
03:20:40.80 --> 03:20:43.80
You can have, you can have like a heat stroke and fall out.

3755
03:20:43.80 --> 03:20:44.80
Yeah.

3756
03:20:44.80 --> 03:20:45.80
But a lot of that is just like gut through it.

3757
03:20:45.80 --> 03:20:46.80
Yeah.

3758
03:20:46.80 --> 03:20:47.80
You can gut through boats on your head.

3759
03:20:47.80 --> 03:20:47.80
Right.

3760
03:20:47.80 --> 03:20:49.80
Like you put the boats on your head during how weak.

3761
03:20:49.80 --> 03:20:51.80
That's just a gut check.

3762
03:20:51.80 --> 03:20:56.80
There's no, if you, if you are a 19 year old American male,

3763
03:20:56.80 --> 03:20:58.80
you can, you can withstand it.

3764
03:20:58.80 --> 03:21:01.80
You can perform the physical activity of boats on your head.

3765
03:21:01.80 --> 03:21:02.80
Right.

3766
03:21:02.80 --> 03:21:03.80
Running around.

3767
03:21:03.80 --> 03:21:05.80
Uh, but a rope climb.

3768
03:21:05.80 --> 03:21:06.80
Yeah.

3769
03:21:06.80 --> 03:21:08.80
Your mind will not get you to the top of that free to rope.

3770
03:21:08.80 --> 03:21:09.80
And your body will.

3771
03:21:09.80 --> 03:21:12.80
So you, you're out there like, oh, it's a mental game.

3772
03:21:12.80 --> 03:21:13.80
Yeah.

3773
03:21:13.80 --> 03:21:13.80
Yeah.

3774
03:21:13.80 --> 03:21:14.80
Cool.

3775
03:21:14.80 --> 03:21:15.80
Climb that rope.

3776
03:21:15.80 --> 03:21:16.80
I really want to climb that rope.

3777
03:21:16.80 --> 03:21:17.80
Yeah.

3778
03:21:17.80 --> 03:21:19.80
But if you can't do it, all the mental strength in the world

3779
03:21:19.80 --> 03:21:21.80
isn't going to get you up that rope.

3780
03:21:21.80 --> 03:21:22.80
And then not.

3781
03:21:22.80 --> 03:21:23.80
Isn't true.

3782
03:21:23.80 --> 03:21:24.80
Got lucky.

3783
03:21:24.80 --> 03:21:26.80
That has body cooperated that day.

3784
03:21:26.80 --> 03:21:27.80
That one day he chose.

3785
03:21:27.80 --> 03:21:28.80
So this is like.

3786
03:21:28.80 --> 03:21:28.80
Yeah.

3787
03:21:28.80 --> 03:21:30.80
Anyway, but he did it.

3788
03:21:30.80 --> 03:21:31.80
Yeah.

3789
03:21:31.80 --> 03:21:32.80
What is it?

3790
03:21:32.80 --> 03:21:35.80
4,241,141 hundred.

3791
03:21:35.80 --> 03:21:36.80
Yeah.

3792
03:21:36.80 --> 03:21:39.80
God can said, then 4,032.

3793
03:21:39.80 --> 03:21:40.80
Yeah.

3794
03:21:40.80 --> 03:21:41.80
But he was supportive of the whole.

3795
03:21:41.80 --> 03:21:42.80
Yeah.

3796
03:21:42.80 --> 03:21:43.80
He was good.

3797
03:21:43.80 --> 03:21:45.80
You know, he met true.

3798
03:21:45.80 --> 03:21:46.80
So he was good with it.

3799
03:21:46.80 --> 03:21:49.80
It's always whenever you see somebody pushing harder.

3800
03:21:49.80 --> 03:21:50.80
Yeah.

3801
03:21:50.80 --> 03:21:53.80
People say in Jiu-Jitsu, I'm going to get you one day to me.

3802
03:21:53.80 --> 03:21:54.80
I'm like, I hope so.

3803
03:21:54.80 --> 03:21:55.80
Yeah.

3804
03:21:55.80 --> 03:21:56.80
And Jiu-Jitsu works.

3805
03:21:56.80 --> 03:21:57.80
Yeah.

3806
03:21:57.80 --> 03:21:58.80
If you work hard, that's what happens.

3807
03:21:58.80 --> 03:21:59.80
Yeah.

3808
03:21:59.80 --> 03:22:00.80
Really.

3809
03:22:00.80 --> 03:22:00.80
Yeah.

3810
03:22:00.80 --> 03:22:03.80
Not going to be mad at someone because they freaking, I'm actually going to be stoked.

3811
03:22:03.80 --> 03:22:04.80
Yeah.

3812
03:22:04.80 --> 03:22:05.80
I'm going to go train harder.

3813
03:22:05.80 --> 03:22:06.80
Train more.

3814
03:22:06.80 --> 03:22:07.80
That's the way it works.

3815
03:22:07.80 --> 03:22:10.80
And then your other son is in the army.

3816
03:22:10.80 --> 03:22:11.80
Yes.

3817
03:22:11.80 --> 03:22:12.80
A ranger.

3818
03:22:12.80 --> 03:22:13.80
Mm-hmm.

3819
03:22:13.80 --> 03:22:14.80
Rangers.

3820
03:22:14.80 --> 03:22:15.80
What's the connection?

3821
03:22:15.80 --> 03:22:19.80
While he was going through, they figured out who he was that you were his dad, or

3822
03:22:19.80 --> 03:22:23.80
some of him, he wanted to be like low pro.

3823
03:22:23.80 --> 03:22:24.80
Yeah.

3824
03:22:24.80 --> 03:22:26.80
Just like Clinton.

3825
03:22:26.80 --> 03:22:29.80
Don't stand out for any reason.

3826
03:22:29.80 --> 03:22:31.80
Don't get any extra attention.

3827
03:22:31.80 --> 03:22:33.80
Don't know what he needs to know when your birthday is.

3828
03:22:33.80 --> 03:22:36.80
Obviously, the worst thing in the military is it seems like.

3829
03:22:36.80 --> 03:22:39.80
Cause people knew you're birthday.

3830
03:22:39.80 --> 03:22:40.80
So, yeah.

3831
03:22:40.80 --> 03:22:42.80
And then you got one more daughter in high school.

3832
03:22:42.80 --> 03:22:43.80
Yeah.

3833
03:22:43.80 --> 03:22:45.34
I'm glad you're doing this year, just senior.

3834
03:22:45.34 --> 03:22:46.14
Right on.

3835
03:22:46.14 --> 03:22:46.98
Awesome.

3836
03:22:46.98 --> 03:22:49.14
Uh, echo.

3837
03:22:49.14 --> 03:22:49.64
Yes.

3838
03:22:49.64 --> 03:22:50.30
You got any questions?

3839
03:22:50.30 --> 03:22:50.64
Yeah.

3840
03:22:50.64 --> 03:22:51.84
Do you actually, how much does it,

3841
03:22:51.84 --> 03:22:53.40
are you ready to be a bow hunter?

3842
03:22:53.40 --> 03:22:54.40
Yeah.

3843
03:22:54.40 --> 03:22:55.92
Oh, actually, which is my way of it.

3844
03:22:55.92 --> 03:22:56.88
Let me ask you a sweet.

3845
03:22:56.88 --> 03:23:01.84
Did I, did I go too hard in the paint on bow hunting as hard?

3846
03:23:01.84 --> 03:23:02.68
Because it's hard.

3847
03:23:02.68 --> 03:23:03.44
It, no, no.

3848
03:23:03.44 --> 03:23:03.96
Okay.

3849
03:23:03.96 --> 03:23:05.40
But it's challenging, but it's rewarding.

3850
03:23:05.40 --> 03:23:07.88
Did that, it seems accurate from my position.

3851
03:23:07.88 --> 03:23:11.04
It catches very limited, by the way, because we all know.

3852
03:23:11.04 --> 03:23:13.32
So that reminds me of a quick question.

3853
03:23:13.32 --> 03:23:18.46
So you know how like, let's say a guy that I know has a crossbow.

3854
03:23:18.46 --> 03:23:22.56
Our bow hunters and crossbows, or crossbow guys, kind of add odds a little bit.

3855
03:23:22.56 --> 03:23:24.80
Crossbow isn't bond.

3856
03:23:24.80 --> 03:23:26.52
So yes, then.

3857
03:23:26.52 --> 03:23:32.68
So if I said hypothetically, that I have a crossbow, would you be kind of mad at me?

3858
03:23:32.68 --> 03:23:35.64
Would you be like, what would I be like one notch lower?

3859
03:23:35.64 --> 03:23:36.64
Yes.

3860
03:23:36.64 --> 03:23:37.64
Okay.

3861
03:23:37.64 --> 03:23:38.64
I understand.

3862
03:23:38.64 --> 03:23:39.64
That was a high point.

3863
03:23:39.64 --> 03:23:40.64
Okay.

3864
03:23:40.64 --> 03:23:42.20
And how much does an arrow weigh?

3865
03:23:42.20 --> 03:23:43.68
Or is it, do they vary?

3866
03:23:43.68 --> 03:23:44.68
Yeah.

3867
03:23:44.68 --> 03:23:46.68
My arrow weighs 540 grains.

3868
03:23:46.68 --> 03:23:48.28
Oh, so there's a girl, okay?

3869
03:23:48.28 --> 03:23:49.28
Yeah, just like bullet.

3870
03:23:49.28 --> 03:23:50.28
Yeah.

3871
03:23:50.28 --> 03:23:52.52
And then the tips you can, you know what?

3872
03:23:52.52 --> 03:23:59.60
Yeah, those can be from 100 grains or even smaller to up to 200 grains.

3873
03:23:59.60 --> 03:24:02.72
And then you have what like the different like broadhead arrow?

3874
03:24:02.72 --> 03:24:03.72
Yeah.

3875
03:24:03.72 --> 03:24:05.24
What is that like the three blades, right?

3876
03:24:05.24 --> 03:24:06.84
They're like blades on the same broadhead.

3877
03:24:06.84 --> 03:24:07.84
Yeah.

3878
03:24:07.84 --> 03:24:09.44
And then what other kind do you use?

3879
03:24:09.44 --> 03:24:11.68
Or is that even a thing?

3880
03:24:11.68 --> 03:24:15.72
Well, there's a field tip that you practice with, so it has no blades.

3881
03:24:15.72 --> 03:24:22.32
And then there's an expandable broadhead, which means that flies with the blades sucked in.

3882
03:24:22.32 --> 03:24:24.64
And then what it hits something, the blades come out.

3883
03:24:24.64 --> 03:24:27.12
They expand out to cut a bigger hole.

3884
03:24:27.12 --> 03:24:31.12
And then there's a fixed blade broadhead, which is what I shoot where the blades are just

3885
03:24:31.12 --> 03:24:32.84
out the whole time.

3886
03:24:32.84 --> 03:24:35.40
And is that like what's just the typical ones?

3887
03:24:35.40 --> 03:24:36.40
Or is there like a bat?

3888
03:24:36.40 --> 03:24:37.76
You know how like in bullets?

3889
03:24:37.76 --> 03:24:38.76
Yeah.

3890
03:24:38.76 --> 03:24:39.76
There's all kinds of broadheads.

3891
03:24:39.76 --> 03:24:47.16
A lot of people are a lot of normally people don't use expandables for elk.

3892
03:24:47.16 --> 03:24:48.36
Some people do.

3893
03:24:48.36 --> 03:24:49.36
And they work.

3894
03:24:49.36 --> 03:24:54.64
I've, for one reason, and Oregon, fixed blade broadheads are the only thing that we're

3895
03:24:54.64 --> 03:24:56.60
legal until like a year or two ago.

3896
03:24:56.60 --> 03:24:58.76
So that's all I've ever used.

3897
03:24:58.76 --> 03:25:02.96
And expandables can cause problems if they hit heavy bone.

3898
03:25:02.96 --> 03:25:07.24
Like that tight bowl of story with an expandable, I wouldn't have got that bowl.

3899
03:25:07.24 --> 03:25:10.000
That my arrow wouldn't have went in 13 inches.

3900
03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.72
I wouldn't have been out to get another element at the next day.

3901
03:25:12.72 --> 03:25:15.52
So it'll loss that bowl with an expandable.

3902
03:25:15.52 --> 03:25:22.12
And expandables also can hit, if you hit like a, maybe like a twig, which is already like

3903
03:25:22.12 --> 03:25:24.28
you, you already got problems if you hit a twig.

3904
03:25:24.28 --> 03:25:25.28
Or something else.

3905
03:25:25.28 --> 03:25:30.24
But it can open those things up maybe early and now like you can have more problems

3906
03:25:30.24 --> 03:25:31.24
too.

3907
03:25:31.24 --> 03:25:32.24
Yeah.

3908
03:25:32.24 --> 03:25:34.56
But the expandable kind of big hole.

3909
03:25:34.56 --> 03:25:38.16
Open a big hole like big.

3910
03:25:38.16 --> 03:25:43.72
So just feel tip expandable and then fix blade.

3911
03:25:43.72 --> 03:25:45.48
So is there like exotic?

3912
03:25:45.48 --> 03:25:46.48
Okay.

3913
03:25:46.48 --> 03:25:47.48
So let's say I know what you're saying.

3914
03:25:47.48 --> 03:25:50.76
He's wants to know if there's like a, the twig's on the other side.

3915
03:25:50.76 --> 03:25:53.88
There's design your broadheads or whatever.

3916
03:25:53.88 --> 03:25:54.88
And go like that.

3917
03:25:54.88 --> 03:25:55.88
Rambo.

3918
03:25:55.88 --> 03:25:56.88
That's what I was going to say.

3919
03:25:56.88 --> 03:25:57.88
Like you got the explosive.

3920
03:25:57.88 --> 03:26:00.68
You got to say all these other ones I would ever.

3921
03:26:00.68 --> 03:26:03.000
Like, there is it like that with arrows or what?

3922
03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000
You know, there hasn't been an explosive.

3923
03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:06.000
I've done some.

3924
03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:08.000
There has to be no.

3925
03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:09.000
I did.

3926
03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:10.000
I did.

3927
03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:11.000
I did.

3928
03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:12.000
I did.

3929
03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:16.68
There's a guy Richard Ryan and he used to, he might have been an original investor or I

3930
03:26:16.68 --> 03:26:17.68
don't, I came in anyway.

3931
03:26:17.68 --> 03:26:20.44
He is part of Black Rifle for a while.

3932
03:26:20.44 --> 03:26:26.44
And he, we did some trick filming with, with, with the, archery and, and Bo shots and

3933
03:26:26.44 --> 03:26:27.44
different things.

3934
03:26:27.44 --> 03:26:28.44
I got shot.

3935
03:26:28.44 --> 03:26:32.48
I shot cheese off a mouse trap that he was holding.

3936
03:26:32.48 --> 03:26:36.40
And so we're trying to see if I can get the cheese off of it before the mouse trap got

3937
03:26:36.40 --> 03:26:37.40
my arrow.

3938
03:26:37.40 --> 03:26:38.92
So he held it and I shot it.

3939
03:26:38.92 --> 03:26:44.24
But another one he did was we put propane flame that shot up and then a paint can

3940
03:26:44.24 --> 03:26:45.24
behind it.

3941
03:26:45.24 --> 03:26:50.84
So the arrow would go through the, propane flame, pull the flame and then puncture

3942
03:26:50.84 --> 03:26:53.52
the paint can then it explode.

3943
03:26:53.52 --> 03:26:55.04
And it's like a huge explosion.

3944
03:26:55.04 --> 03:26:59.40
So I made a joke that was like, I shouldn't a rambo brought him.

3945
03:26:59.40 --> 03:27:05.52
But there hasn't been a rambo brought head yet like in, I think is Rambo 2.

3946
03:27:05.52 --> 03:27:06.92
One of the greatest films of all time.

3947
03:27:06.92 --> 03:27:07.92
Yes, sir.

3948
03:27:07.92 --> 03:27:08.92
Yes.

3949
03:27:08.92 --> 03:27:16.68
But there has been one where they're shooting is like a 357 shell casing or shell on the

3950
03:27:16.68 --> 03:27:17.80
end of an arrow.

3951
03:27:17.80 --> 03:27:20.60
And it would like, I think they killed some hogs with it.

3952
03:27:20.60 --> 03:27:22.92
Like it hit the hog and then fire the primer.

3953
03:27:22.92 --> 03:27:23.92
Yeah.

3954
03:27:23.92 --> 03:27:25.64
I've never used one.

3955
03:27:25.64 --> 03:27:28.04
But that's the closest we got to Rambo.

3956
03:27:28.04 --> 03:27:29.04
I could see where.

3957
03:27:29.04 --> 03:27:30.04
All right.

3958
03:27:30.04 --> 03:27:33.08
Since I know echo pretty well, I can see he's got all kinds of like he wants to have

3959
03:27:33.08 --> 03:27:35.36
a selection of the party.

3960
03:27:35.36 --> 03:27:37.36
Designer, yeah, broadheads.

3961
03:27:37.36 --> 03:27:39.20
But that's different ones, yes, sir.

3962
03:27:39.20 --> 03:27:40.76
So there's no twisty one.

3963
03:27:40.76 --> 03:27:43.60
You know, like I figured that would be a thing.

3964
03:27:43.60 --> 03:27:48.24
The broadheads I use actually the blades come off at an angle.

3965
03:27:48.24 --> 03:27:53.04
And I think it enhances, because when an arrow flies for to be accurate, there has to

3966
03:27:53.04 --> 03:27:54.88
be helical on it.

3967
03:27:54.88 --> 03:27:56.72
Just like rifling on a barrel.

3968
03:27:56.72 --> 03:27:59.48
So that's what it gives that direction.

3969
03:27:59.48 --> 03:28:04.16
This is like a so a muzzle loader if it's just a ball isn't very accurate.

3970
03:28:04.16 --> 03:28:05.16
But that twist.

3971
03:28:05.16 --> 03:28:07.16
So same thing with the narrowest and principle.

3972
03:28:07.16 --> 03:28:11.96
The flesh on the back of the arrow is what gives direction to that arrow.

3973
03:28:11.96 --> 03:28:14.20
Well, my broadheads come off at an angle.

3974
03:28:14.20 --> 03:28:15.84
And I think it enhances.

3975
03:28:15.84 --> 03:28:18.80
So when it hits an animal, it's twisting as it cuts.

3976
03:28:18.80 --> 03:28:24.48
And I think it cuts a more devastating womb channel because it's going like that.

3977
03:28:24.48 --> 03:28:31.28
So it cuts a hole instead of just slices.

3978
03:28:31.28 --> 03:28:33.88
You're going to get some things for your crossbow growth.

3979
03:28:33.88 --> 03:28:40.40
I'm going to look deeper into this stuff.

3980
03:28:40.40 --> 03:28:41.40
Right on.

3981
03:28:41.40 --> 03:28:43.40
I like it.

3982
03:28:43.40 --> 03:28:46.36
Cam, any closing thoughts and things we missed?

3983
03:28:46.36 --> 03:28:48.48
Like I said, it's an honor to be here.

3984
03:28:48.48 --> 03:28:54.88
I mean, I don't feel worthy of sitting with you guys, honestly.

3985
03:28:54.88 --> 03:28:57.44
This is, I never thought I'd be here.

3986
03:28:57.44 --> 03:29:01.64
I never thought I'd be here talking to you guys or larger than life for me and for a lot

3987
03:29:01.64 --> 03:29:02.96
of others.

3988
03:29:02.96 --> 03:29:06.56
We actually had this training at work not long ago.

3989
03:29:06.56 --> 03:29:11.36
And the trainer mentioned this Navy Seal, Jocco.

3990
03:29:11.36 --> 03:29:17.36
And he's like, and I was just like, I know Jocco.

3991
03:29:17.36 --> 03:29:21.44
So yeah, this seems, you know, I used to reel earlier, but it does.

3992
03:29:21.44 --> 03:29:23.08
It feels, I don't know.

3993
03:29:23.08 --> 03:29:24.44
I'm honored to be here.

3994
03:29:24.44 --> 03:29:28.84
I'm honored that you looked at my book and you actually gave me advice when I was

3995
03:29:28.84 --> 03:29:31.08
just like in a publisher.

3996
03:29:31.08 --> 03:29:33.04
You guys use the same publishers, me?

3997
03:29:33.04 --> 03:29:35.12
Same publisher, same marons.

3998
03:29:35.12 --> 03:29:39.84
And so you gave me some great advice there and you've been a resource and now we're partners.

3999
03:29:39.84 --> 03:29:43.000
And it doesn't feel like my life.

4000
03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.000
But thank you.

4001
03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:47.32
Well, right, all man, as I mentioned earlier, I feel the same way.

4002
03:29:47.32 --> 03:29:54.24
Like here, I am talking with the freaking world, world class dude and it's just awesome.

4003
03:29:54.24 --> 03:29:55.88
So thanks for coming on.

4004
03:29:55.88 --> 03:29:58.52
Thanks for sharing your lessons learned.

4005
03:29:58.52 --> 03:30:04.96
And thanks for your encouragement to me and so many other people.

4006
03:30:04.96 --> 03:30:06.16
Like there's so many other people.

4007
03:30:06.16 --> 03:30:11.20
I know that you inspire so many people to get on the path of bow hunting, but not just

4008
03:30:11.20 --> 03:30:14.20
get on the path of bow hunting, just to get on a better path in their life.

4009
03:30:14.20 --> 03:30:19.48
And I think this book is going to do that even more.

4010
03:30:19.48 --> 03:30:25.80
And as you said, it's an honor to be working with you, partner with you, and to take, you

4011
03:30:25.80 --> 03:30:31.000
know, what this thing is, you know, talk to Kip, talk to Pete, I can feel it.

4012
03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:32.24
There's like a rocket.

4013
03:30:32.24 --> 03:30:33.24
It's like a rocket.

4014
03:30:33.24 --> 03:30:34.88
You can watch the fuse.

4015
03:30:34.88 --> 03:30:36.44
It's burned in right now.

4016
03:30:36.44 --> 03:30:42.08
The temperatures come in. We're testing product. Like we're ready to watch this thing go

4017
03:30:42.08 --> 03:30:43.08
Richter.

4018
03:30:43.08 --> 03:30:45.08
So thanks for what you do.

4019
03:30:45.08 --> 03:30:48.80
And thanks for inspiring people all over the world.

4020
03:30:48.80 --> 03:30:49.80
Thank you.

4021
03:30:49.80 --> 03:30:50.80
Take care.

4022
03:30:50.80 --> 03:30:51.80
Take care.

4023
03:30:51.80 --> 03:30:52.80
Thank you guys.

4024
03:30:52.80 --> 03:30:53.80
I appreciate it.

4025
03:30:53.80 --> 03:30:55.80
Right on.

4026
03:30:55.80 --> 03:31:00.24
And with that, Cameron Haynes has left the building.

4027
03:31:00.24 --> 03:31:01.56
Echo Charles.

4028
03:31:01.56 --> 03:31:03.36
Are you ready to become a bow hunter?

4029
03:31:03.36 --> 03:31:04.36
I think so.

4030
03:31:04.36 --> 03:31:05.36
Yeah.

4031
03:31:05.36 --> 03:31:13.36
I was trying to think of Crossbow hunting versus bow hunting.

4032
03:31:13.36 --> 03:31:18.08
And I was trying to think of what a good example would be.

4033
03:31:18.08 --> 03:31:20.64
I kind of landed on surfing versus body boarding.

4034
03:31:20.64 --> 03:31:22.44
That makes sense to me.

4035
03:31:22.44 --> 03:31:23.44
Thank you, man.

4036
03:31:23.44 --> 03:31:28.80
No disrespect to body boarding.

4037
03:31:28.80 --> 03:31:33.44
But something along those lines a little bit where let's face it.

4038
03:31:33.44 --> 03:31:34.44
Let's face it.

4039
03:31:34.44 --> 03:31:39.20
More skill to surf than body board fundamentally.

4040
03:31:39.20 --> 03:31:40.20
Sure.

4041
03:31:40.20 --> 03:31:43.60
No, again, no disrespect to the spongers at the highest level.

4042
03:31:43.60 --> 03:31:45.64
How they're getting after it.

4043
03:31:45.64 --> 03:31:47.72
The fact is I don't know.

4044
03:31:47.72 --> 03:31:51.24
But it seems that that's the case.

4045
03:31:51.24 --> 03:31:53.16
So even like, yeah, okay.

4046
03:31:53.16 --> 03:31:56.28
So I know guy with a crossbow.

4047
03:31:56.28 --> 03:31:58.16
And he let me shoot it from time to time.

4048
03:31:58.16 --> 03:32:02.08
And I have shot a bow before.

4049
03:32:02.08 --> 03:32:03.32
When did you shoot a bow?

4050
03:32:03.32 --> 03:32:05.92
Actually, the last time I did was about a week ago.

4051
03:32:05.92 --> 03:32:06.76
Where?

4052
03:32:06.76 --> 03:32:07.76
At Greg Train's house.

4053
03:32:07.76 --> 03:32:08.76
Oh, that's right.

4054
03:32:08.76 --> 03:32:09.76
Greg Train's on that.

4055
03:32:09.76 --> 03:32:11.76
Yeah, his arms were a little short of my hands.

4056
03:32:11.76 --> 03:32:13.92
So it was like, but then I shot one at the origin camp.

4057
03:32:13.92 --> 03:32:14.92
One of the guys.

4058
03:32:14.92 --> 03:32:15.92
No one.

4059
03:32:15.92 --> 03:32:16.92
Yeah.

4060
03:32:16.92 --> 03:32:17.92
And I dig it.

4061
03:32:17.92 --> 03:32:19.64
I'm with it, man.

4062
03:32:19.64 --> 03:32:23.04
I made a bullseye to by the way, but it's neither here nor there.

4063
03:32:23.04 --> 03:32:24.80
Just naturally skilled like that.

4064
03:32:24.80 --> 03:32:28.32
So why do you buy a crossbow?

4065
03:32:28.32 --> 03:32:31.28
The guy who has had the crossbow from before.

4066
03:32:31.28 --> 03:32:36.40
Either way, yes, the bow seemed or has a lot more going on.

4067
03:32:36.40 --> 03:32:37.40
For sure.

4068
03:32:37.40 --> 03:32:39.56
So I can dig how you'd say that.

4069
03:32:39.56 --> 03:32:40.56
It's not.

4070
03:32:40.56 --> 03:32:42.96
I was gonna think a ghee versus no ghee, but it's not that.

4071
03:32:42.96 --> 03:32:43.96
Because no ghee, they're both.

4072
03:32:43.96 --> 03:32:44.96
They're both highly respected.

4073
03:32:44.96 --> 03:32:45.96
Yes.

4074
03:32:45.96 --> 03:32:46.96
Really respected.

4075
03:32:46.96 --> 03:32:49.80
And difficult.

4076
03:32:49.80 --> 03:32:52.16
And there's a lot to both of them.

4077
03:32:52.16 --> 03:32:54.16
Regardless of perception.

4078
03:32:54.16 --> 03:32:55.16
That's okay.

4079
03:32:55.16 --> 03:32:56.16
I found it.

4080
03:32:56.16 --> 03:32:57.16
I think I found it.

4081
03:32:57.16 --> 03:33:00.40
Skate boarding versus scooters.

4082
03:33:00.40 --> 03:33:01.40
Like the two wheelers.

4083
03:33:01.40 --> 03:33:05.68
So that's what you're crossbow is.

4084
03:33:05.68 --> 03:33:09.56
You're on a razor scooter taking up a room in the half pipe.

4085
03:33:09.56 --> 03:33:10.56
Yeah.

4086
03:33:10.56 --> 03:33:12.80
That's what's going on.

4087
03:33:12.80 --> 03:33:13.80
Did I make?

4088
03:33:13.80 --> 03:33:17.96
And I asked you this during the podcast, but it's so hard.

4089
03:33:17.96 --> 03:33:20.36
But hunting is so hard.

4090
03:33:20.36 --> 03:33:25.60
I hope I didn't discourage anyone from trying it and doing it.

4091
03:33:25.60 --> 03:33:27.92
But you got to recognize there's a lot going on, man.

4092
03:33:27.92 --> 03:33:29.48
This is not an easy game to play.

4093
03:33:29.48 --> 03:33:30.48
Oh, yeah.

4094
03:33:30.48 --> 03:33:31.48
That's freaking hard.

4095
03:33:31.48 --> 03:33:32.48
Oh, it's real hard.

4096
03:33:32.48 --> 03:33:40.72
Actually, even that opening that you opened with, it made me physically feel probably

4097
03:33:40.72 --> 03:33:44.92
a good element of how hard it is because I remember back, you know, like when I'm thinking,

4098
03:33:44.92 --> 03:33:48.40
okay, the first time I ever shot a bow, I'm like, okay, this is like, dude, I got to pay attention

4099
03:33:48.40 --> 03:33:49.40
to all this stuff.

4100
03:33:49.40 --> 03:33:51.40
And then I got to aim in a certain way and all this stuff.

4101
03:33:51.40 --> 03:33:55.28
And then that's just my, and there's not to mention like the 1000 things that I don't

4102
03:33:55.28 --> 03:33:56.68
know about.

4103
03:33:56.68 --> 03:34:01.000
And then you want to mix that with actually going out and doing it with any animal.

4104
03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:02.000
Any animal.

4105
03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:03.96
It's, it's crazy.

4106
03:34:03.96 --> 03:34:07.40
And then you got to learn about all these different animals because they all act different

4107
03:34:07.40 --> 03:34:14.44
by the way, like a bear does this, you know, elk does that and a deer does something else.

4108
03:34:14.44 --> 03:34:16.08
Like they all have different reactions.

4109
03:34:16.08 --> 03:34:17.76
They all have different senses.

4110
03:34:17.76 --> 03:34:23.12
So, and then you got to like I said, then once you shoot that animal, then you got to

4111
03:34:23.12 --> 03:34:25.28
go find that thing.

4112
03:34:25.28 --> 03:34:30.96
If you got a shot that was good enough to make the animal bleed.

4113
03:34:30.96 --> 03:34:34.16
So the thing is, yes, extremely challenging.

4114
03:34:34.16 --> 03:34:37.64
Other side of that spectrum, it's an awesome reward.

4115
03:34:37.64 --> 03:34:38.64
Awesome reward.

4116
03:34:38.64 --> 03:34:41.48
You asked, do I want to be a bow hunter now?

4117
03:34:41.48 --> 03:34:42.48
Prunk kind of.

4118
03:34:42.48 --> 03:34:43.48
Right.

4119
03:34:43.48 --> 03:34:47.20
And here's the thing, like I think, and this is an actually, and this didn't start right

4120
03:34:47.20 --> 03:34:48.20
now though.

4121
03:34:48.20 --> 03:34:53.16
I think right, right one Cameron Hayne, even Judd, John Dead Dudley, when they kind of came

4122
03:34:53.16 --> 03:34:56.36
up, exploded onto the scene, bro, I felt it then.

4123
03:34:56.36 --> 03:34:59.40
No, it wasn't like I kind of dope.

4124
03:34:59.40 --> 03:35:03.08
And you know, you see other people doing it and then talk about it, kind of just kind of

4125
03:35:03.08 --> 03:35:07.72
exposes it in a way that, you know, I haven't been exposed to it.

4126
03:35:07.72 --> 03:35:10.76
And I'm sure a lot of other people seem to seem to deal because I noticed a lot of people

4127
03:35:10.76 --> 03:35:13.08
picked it up after that kind of started.

4128
03:35:13.08 --> 03:35:14.08
Yeah, for sure.

4129
03:35:14.08 --> 03:35:15.08
I'm wonderful.

4130
03:35:15.08 --> 03:35:16.08
Yeah, I feel it.

4131
03:35:16.08 --> 03:35:17.08
I feel it.

4132
03:35:17.08 --> 03:35:18.08
So yeah, I do.

4133
03:35:18.08 --> 03:35:19.36
All right, we're good.

4134
03:35:19.36 --> 03:35:24.28
Hey, uh, gonna need to get in good shape if you're gonna do any kind of hunting or if

4135
03:35:24.28 --> 03:35:28.000
you can do any kind of living, by the way, just being alive, I recommend you being

4136
03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:29.000
good shape.

4137
03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:31.40
Just like it pays to be in good shape when you're out of the mountain, maybe you could get

4138
03:35:31.40 --> 03:35:34.80
that one tenth of a percent that's going to make the difference.

4139
03:35:34.80 --> 03:35:37.56
What's that one tenth of a percent in life?

4140
03:35:37.56 --> 03:35:38.60
Let's think about that.

4141
03:35:38.60 --> 03:35:44.24
So that means staying physically active, healthy, working out, pushing yourself.

4142
03:35:44.24 --> 03:35:45.88
You know what that means?

4143
03:35:45.88 --> 03:35:46.88
Yes.

4144
03:35:46.88 --> 03:35:47.88
What does it mean?

4145
03:35:47.88 --> 03:35:49.88
It means a lot of things.

4146
03:35:49.88 --> 03:35:55.64
But, you know, so with my kids and you can kind of mention this before, right, where

4147
03:35:55.64 --> 03:35:59.12
with kids like they're watching you.

4148
03:35:59.12 --> 03:36:02.16
So sometimes they're gonna be like, oh, I see, you know, dad's doing this, so they might

4149
03:36:02.16 --> 03:36:05.72
want to try to imitate a little bit, just to see what the what the hype is all about, you

4150
03:36:05.72 --> 03:36:06.72
know?

4151
03:36:06.72 --> 03:36:11.48
And so my kids in my very specific situation, like they'll start jumping in on the

4152
03:36:11.48 --> 03:36:14.96
workouts or whatever, sort of making little goals and stuff like that.

4153
03:36:14.96 --> 03:36:22.80
And they have to endure things like domes or their domes.

4154
03:36:22.80 --> 03:36:24.04
That's basically what it is, right?

4155
03:36:24.04 --> 03:36:26.64
But when your kid, domes is like, you know what that is.

4156
03:36:26.64 --> 03:36:28.84
You just think it's like, your body's breaking down.

4157
03:36:28.84 --> 03:36:29.84
You're like, that's a big truth.

4158
03:36:29.84 --> 03:36:30.84
I got domes.

4159
03:36:30.84 --> 03:36:31.84
What up?

4160
03:36:31.84 --> 03:36:32.84
You know, not yet.

4161
03:36:32.84 --> 03:36:36.60
Until you explain it or whatever, but either way, you get sorness.

4162
03:36:36.60 --> 03:36:40.52
It's not all like freaking bulls eyes is what I'm saying.

4163
03:36:40.52 --> 03:36:41.52
True.

4164
03:36:41.52 --> 03:36:43.40
You know, you get some pain.

4165
03:36:43.40 --> 03:36:44.40
Get some aches.

4166
03:36:44.40 --> 03:36:46.08
Some good days and bad days.

4167
03:36:46.08 --> 03:36:47.08
It's what I'm saying.

4168
03:36:47.08 --> 03:36:48.08
Takes effort.

4169
03:36:48.08 --> 03:36:53.04
Well, when you start feeling some of those bad days, maybe you need some more protein,

4170
03:36:53.04 --> 03:36:54.04
right?

4171
03:36:54.04 --> 03:36:58.12
Get yourself some milk, get yourself some joint warfare, get yourself some super

4172
03:36:58.12 --> 03:37:04.32
curl, get yourself some jocquaffeeal, jocquaffeeal.com, make that happen out of the

4173
03:37:04.32 --> 03:37:05.32
gate.

4174
03:37:05.32 --> 03:37:06.32
Yep.

4175
03:37:06.32 --> 03:37:11.84
We got new flavors on the energy drinks that are coming.

4176
03:37:11.84 --> 03:37:13.40
All the flavors are new.

4177
03:37:13.40 --> 03:37:14.40
Right.

4178
03:37:14.40 --> 03:37:17.32
So again, you mentioned that before we started recording.

4179
03:37:17.32 --> 03:37:20.80
And it's the way you said, okay, took clarify, they're not new flavors.

4180
03:37:20.80 --> 03:37:24.44
The same flavors redefined or remastered.

4181
03:37:24.44 --> 03:37:25.44
Remastered.

4182
03:37:25.44 --> 03:37:26.44
Yeah.

4183
03:37:26.44 --> 03:37:28.000
And even you could just say, mastered.

4184
03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:30.32
Because here's the thing.

4185
03:37:30.32 --> 03:37:32.96
The initial flavor profiles.

4186
03:37:32.96 --> 03:37:34.60
Let's call them.

4187
03:37:34.60 --> 03:37:37.40
They were based on my sense of taste.

4188
03:37:37.40 --> 03:37:39.80
Which my sense of taste, you know, not eat a bunch of sweets.

4189
03:37:39.80 --> 03:37:42.08
All the sudden, I drink something with monk fruit in it.

4190
03:37:42.08 --> 03:37:43.08
I'm like, whoa.

4191
03:37:43.08 --> 03:37:44.08
I'm used to drinking water.

4192
03:37:44.08 --> 03:37:45.08
Right.

4193
03:37:45.08 --> 03:37:48.64
So you put a little monk fruit in something.

4194
03:37:48.64 --> 03:37:53.08
And I think I'm, I think I'm having a freaking, uh, a dang.

4195
03:37:53.08 --> 03:37:57.52
It's just a coker cola, right?

4196
03:37:57.52 --> 03:38:01.28
With a little tiny one-tenth to one percent of some monk fruit in there, I think I

4197
03:38:01.28 --> 03:38:02.28
got a coker cola.

4198
03:38:02.28 --> 03:38:03.48
I'm like, yeah, this tastes delicious.

4199
03:38:03.48 --> 03:38:04.48
This is so sweet.

4200
03:38:04.48 --> 03:38:05.48
I was wrong.

4201
03:38:05.48 --> 03:38:06.48
Yeah.

4202
03:38:06.48 --> 03:38:12.84
So we've adjusted so that they taste even better, kind of hit in the shelves.

4203
03:38:12.84 --> 03:38:17.24
Right now, depending on where you're at, depending on, yeah, it's depending on where you're

4204
03:38:17.24 --> 03:38:18.24
at.

4205
03:38:18.24 --> 03:38:23.40
But as you're hearing this, it's time to start getting back into the game.

4206
03:38:23.40 --> 03:38:27.24
If you didn't like the original flavors, we made them all, they taste, here's the thing,

4207
03:38:27.24 --> 03:38:29.72
we're going to win on taste now.

4208
03:38:29.72 --> 03:38:33.000
Before we were winning on this is good for you.

4209
03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:34.000
Everything else is poisonous.

4210
03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:35.60
It's actually going to kill you.

4211
03:38:35.60 --> 03:38:36.60
Yeah.

4212
03:38:36.60 --> 03:38:37.60
We were winning on that.

4213
03:38:37.60 --> 03:38:39.72
And winning on that.

4214
03:38:39.72 --> 03:38:41.44
But you also got a win on taste.

4215
03:38:41.44 --> 03:38:42.84
So now we're going to win on taste.

4216
03:38:42.84 --> 03:38:45.84
We're winning on all fronts.

4217
03:38:45.84 --> 03:38:46.84
So there you go.

4218
03:38:46.84 --> 03:38:47.84
DrFuel.com.

4219
03:38:47.84 --> 03:38:48.84
I will.

4220
03:38:48.84 --> 03:38:49.84
Coming your way.

4221
03:38:49.84 --> 03:38:54.20
Second, that being someone who has tasted the new flavor, I will agree with that.

4222
03:38:54.20 --> 03:38:56.000
Wait, flavor, or flavors.

4223
03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:57.48
Because I've tasted all new flavors in the wrong way.

4224
03:38:57.48 --> 03:38:58.84
Well, I just tasted the mango.

4225
03:38:58.84 --> 03:39:00.84
So, oh, no, no, the mango in the orange.

4226
03:39:00.84 --> 03:39:01.84
So, yeah.

4227
03:39:01.84 --> 03:39:03.72
They're freaking delicious.

4228
03:39:03.72 --> 03:39:05.16
You can get the drinks at Wawa.

4229
03:39:05.16 --> 03:39:08.28
You can get all the stuff at Vitamin Shop, or you can get all the chocolate filled.com.

4230
03:39:08.28 --> 03:39:10.72
Check some of that out.

4231
03:39:10.72 --> 03:39:18.36
And if you watch the video version of this on our YouTube channel, Doc Opawncast, you're

4232
03:39:18.36 --> 03:39:19.76
probably going to see camhaines ago.

4233
03:39:19.76 --> 03:39:20.76
What's camhaines look like?

4234
03:39:20.76 --> 03:39:24.44
And they're going to go, well, what's he wearing on his upper torso?

4235
03:39:24.44 --> 03:39:25.44
Sure.

4236
03:39:25.44 --> 03:39:29.36
You heard us talk about origin hunt.

4237
03:39:29.36 --> 03:39:31.28
So origin hunt is coming.

4238
03:39:31.28 --> 03:39:33.92
If you want to check into that, or if you're going to check in in whatever American

4239
03:39:33.92 --> 03:39:37.16
made just paragines, you want to check American made parabuts.

4240
03:39:37.16 --> 03:39:39.20
You want to check American made t-shirt.

4241
03:39:39.20 --> 03:39:40.52
American made bini.

4242
03:39:40.52 --> 03:39:42.20
American made wallet.

4243
03:39:42.20 --> 03:39:43.20
Belt.

4244
03:39:43.20 --> 03:39:44.20
Whatever.

4245
03:39:44.20 --> 03:39:46.92
If you want to bring manufacturing back to America, you want to support American

4246
03:39:46.92 --> 03:39:47.92
want to support freedom.

4247
03:39:47.92 --> 03:39:50.52
If you're anti-slave labor.

4248
03:39:50.52 --> 03:39:55.84
Go to origin usay.com and get yourself what you need.

4249
03:39:55.84 --> 03:39:57.32
Don't get tricked to you.

4250
03:39:57.32 --> 03:40:02.04
You can be anti uniquely priced labor.

4251
03:40:02.04 --> 03:40:03.04
What's the same deal?

4252
03:40:03.04 --> 03:40:05.44
What's the uniquely priced labor?

4253
03:40:05.44 --> 03:40:06.44
Is that what they call it?

4254
03:40:06.44 --> 03:40:08.44
Is that a euphemism for slave labor?

4255
03:40:08.44 --> 03:40:09.44
Yeah, yeah.

4256
03:40:09.44 --> 03:40:12.68
That's the what you call the euphemism.

4257
03:40:12.68 --> 03:40:13.68
The buzzword.

4258
03:40:13.68 --> 03:40:14.88
Yeah, the one that sounds good.

4259
03:40:14.88 --> 03:40:15.88
You know, that's a euphemism.

4260
03:40:15.88 --> 03:40:16.88
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4261
03:40:16.88 --> 03:40:17.88
This sounds good.

4262
03:40:17.88 --> 03:40:19.36
That's exactly what it is.

4263
03:40:19.36 --> 03:40:20.36
What is called slavery?

4264
03:40:20.36 --> 03:40:21.36
Yeah.

4265
03:40:21.36 --> 03:40:24.52
They in fact know how this is a freaking kid working for a dollar a week.

4266
03:40:24.52 --> 03:40:25.52
Oh yeah.

4267
03:40:25.52 --> 03:40:26.96
Cancer causing conditions.

4268
03:40:26.96 --> 03:40:27.96
Forced to.

4269
03:40:27.96 --> 03:40:30.20
By the way, forced to.

4270
03:40:30.20 --> 03:40:33.44
So this is America.

4271
03:40:33.44 --> 03:40:36.08
This is America.

4272
03:40:36.08 --> 03:40:38.92
We're not doing that.

4273
03:40:38.92 --> 03:40:43.04
We've got American made stuff supported.

4274
03:40:43.04 --> 03:40:44.48
It's George and USA.com.

4275
03:40:44.48 --> 03:40:45.48
This is America.

4276
03:40:45.48 --> 03:40:46.48
Yeah.

4277
03:40:46.48 --> 03:40:47.48
Blacks.

4278
03:40:47.48 --> 03:40:51.08
You kind of sounded like Pete right there when you said it like that.

4279
03:40:51.08 --> 03:40:52.08
Does Pete say it like that?

4280
03:40:52.08 --> 03:40:53.08
Yes.

4281
03:40:53.08 --> 03:40:54.64
Come on, I've been heard them say that.

4282
03:40:54.64 --> 03:40:56.64
Not to mention, you did this stuff as well on there.

4283
03:40:56.64 --> 03:40:57.64
Yeah.

4284
03:40:57.64 --> 03:40:58.64
American made.

4285
03:40:58.64 --> 03:40:59.64
That's basically it.

4286
03:40:59.64 --> 03:41:00.64
Oh yeah.

4287
03:41:00.64 --> 03:41:02.64
Yeah, we were doing, you know, when it would be called spring cleaning.

4288
03:41:02.64 --> 03:41:04.84
You know, I was observing.

4289
03:41:04.84 --> 03:41:11.12
But it was going on at my house and my wife brought out all the keys that I have to

4290
03:41:11.12 --> 03:41:13.48
kind of organize or whatever.

4291
03:41:13.48 --> 03:41:15.56
And yeah, I saw the comparison.

4292
03:41:15.56 --> 03:41:17.36
You know, they still have the keys.

4293
03:41:17.36 --> 03:41:19.40
Apparently, I didn't know.

4294
03:41:19.40 --> 03:41:21.16
Are they in the garbage now?

4295
03:41:21.16 --> 03:41:22.56
In the garage on the floor.

4296
03:41:22.56 --> 03:41:24.16
So you're heading to the garbage.

4297
03:41:24.16 --> 03:41:25.16
Yeah.

4298
03:41:25.16 --> 03:41:26.16
Exactly.

4299
03:41:26.16 --> 03:41:27.16
That's so happy.

4300
03:41:27.16 --> 03:41:28.16
I don't have any other keys anymore.

4301
03:41:28.16 --> 03:41:29.16
Yeah.

4302
03:41:29.16 --> 03:41:30.16
It's kind of worthless.

4303
03:41:30.16 --> 03:41:32.16
You know, no offense, but they're kind of worthless kind of.

4304
03:41:32.16 --> 03:41:37.16
It shows you how malleable the human mind is because we all just thought that's just

4305
03:41:37.16 --> 03:41:38.16
how it's going to be.

4306
03:41:38.16 --> 03:41:43.20
Just a just a wearing the most uncomfortable thing on your body while you're trying to

4307
03:41:43.20 --> 03:41:45.20
be athletic and moving around.

4308
03:41:45.20 --> 03:41:46.20
No reason for that.

4309
03:41:46.20 --> 03:41:47.20
No reason for that.

4310
03:41:47.20 --> 03:41:48.20
OrgeneUSA.com.

4311
03:41:48.20 --> 03:41:49.20
That's true.

4312
03:41:49.20 --> 03:41:54.16
Also, if you want to represent while we're on this path, it's hard path.

4313
03:41:54.16 --> 03:41:55.48
That's one might say.

4314
03:41:55.48 --> 03:42:00.80
But hey, you want to represent go to jockelstore.com so you can get your apparel.

4315
03:42:00.80 --> 03:42:01.80
This one equals freedom.

4316
03:42:01.80 --> 03:42:04.08
It got some new discipline equals freedom.

4317
03:42:04.08 --> 03:42:05.08
Standard issue.

4318
03:42:05.08 --> 03:42:07.80
By the way, back to old school.

4319
03:42:07.80 --> 03:42:11.84
I don't want to do too much detail, but it's a basic design.

4320
03:42:11.84 --> 03:42:13.84
This one equals freedom.

4321
03:42:13.84 --> 03:42:17.80
And there's certain layers on there that you'll probably know this school.

4322
03:42:17.80 --> 03:42:21.84
Say, if you have a keen eye, you'll notice the layers done the last week.

4323
03:42:21.84 --> 03:42:22.84
Got some new stuff on there.

4324
03:42:22.84 --> 03:42:24.68
Anyway, if you want to represent, that's where you can get it.

4325
03:42:24.68 --> 03:42:25.68
Jockelstore.

4326
03:42:25.68 --> 03:42:29.60
There's also the shirt locker, which is your subscriptions shirts.

4327
03:42:29.60 --> 03:42:32.64
For every month, good design.

4328
03:42:32.64 --> 03:42:33.64
unique.

4329
03:42:33.64 --> 03:42:35.48
unique, creative fun.

4330
03:42:35.48 --> 03:42:38.04
In fact, this last one, I'm not going to tell you what it is.

4331
03:42:38.04 --> 03:42:39.04
Maybe I will.

4332
03:42:39.04 --> 03:42:43.28
But it was one of the, you know, every month, so all you'll get one, where people will

4333
03:42:43.28 --> 03:42:47.000
actually go out of their way to send you messages with them wearing the shirt.

4334
03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:49.84
Say, hey, you knocked it out of the park with this one.

4335
03:42:49.84 --> 03:42:52.12
I got that this past month.

4336
03:42:52.12 --> 03:42:53.92
Or this current month.

4337
03:42:53.92 --> 03:42:55.44
Where have I seen it yet?

4338
03:42:55.44 --> 03:42:56.44
Nope.

4339
03:42:56.44 --> 03:42:57.44
So it's not released yet.

4340
03:42:57.44 --> 03:42:58.44
This is not released.

4341
03:42:58.44 --> 03:42:59.76
Now everything's live.

4342
03:42:59.76 --> 03:43:02.84
So the first of the month, you, I don't care if you sign up on the first of the month,

4343
03:43:02.84 --> 03:43:05.28
or you, your order is on the first month.

4344
03:43:05.28 --> 03:43:06.28
It's that month.

4345
03:43:06.28 --> 03:43:07.28
It's all current.

4346
03:43:07.28 --> 03:43:09.44
So yeah, it's this month.

4347
03:43:09.44 --> 03:43:10.44
What does it make?

4348
03:43:10.44 --> 03:43:11.44
Yep.

4349
03:43:11.44 --> 03:43:15.04
That make sure we're just going to be very high esteemed.

4350
03:43:15.04 --> 03:43:16.04
Either way.

4351
03:43:16.04 --> 03:43:17.44
Yeah, Jockelstore.com.

4352
03:43:17.44 --> 03:43:20.08
Yeah, I need if you can subscribe to the shirt locker.

4353
03:43:20.08 --> 03:43:22.52
And you can subscribe to the podcast.

4354
03:43:22.52 --> 03:43:23.52
Legally.

4355
03:43:23.52 --> 03:43:24.52
Go out there.

4356
03:43:24.52 --> 03:43:28.12
Leave a review or whatever they say to do.

4357
03:43:28.12 --> 03:43:29.12
Yeah.

4358
03:43:29.12 --> 03:43:31.12
Jockelornerground.com.

4359
03:43:31.12 --> 03:43:33.12
We're doing a lot of Q&A on that.

4360
03:43:33.12 --> 03:43:37.52
We're also addressing some of the lives.

4361
03:43:37.52 --> 03:43:40.36
Some of the aspects of life that we can gain an edge on that maybe we're not thinking

4362
03:43:40.36 --> 03:43:41.36
about.

4363
03:43:41.36 --> 03:43:42.36
Yeah.

4364
03:43:42.36 --> 03:43:43.36
Right.

4365
03:43:43.36 --> 03:43:45.48
So that's probably a good thing to pay attention to.

4366
03:43:45.48 --> 03:43:49.44
The reason we have that is there's strange things going on in the world.

4367
03:43:49.44 --> 03:43:50.84
There's censorship.

4368
03:43:50.84 --> 03:43:53.28
People are getting banned, shadow banned for home on yards.

4369
03:43:53.28 --> 03:43:56.92
We don't have any control over the platform that you're listening to this on right now.

4370
03:43:56.92 --> 03:43:59.48
We do have control over Jockelornerground.com.

4371
03:43:59.48 --> 03:44:02.28
So if you want to help us out there, you can sign up for that.

4372
03:44:02.28 --> 03:44:05.44
It costs $8.18 a month.

4373
03:44:05.44 --> 03:44:08.92
If you can't afford that, we still want you in the game.

4374
03:44:08.92 --> 03:44:12.04
You can email assistance at Jockelornerground.com.

4375
03:44:12.04 --> 03:44:14.20
We have a YouTube channel.

4376
03:44:14.20 --> 03:44:18.88
You can see what Cameron Haynes is awesome looking sweatshirt.

4377
03:44:18.88 --> 03:44:19.88
He took it off after a walk.

4378
03:44:19.88 --> 03:44:20.88
Because it is one.

4379
03:44:20.88 --> 03:44:21.88
Yes.

4380
03:44:21.88 --> 03:44:22.88
Yeah.

4381
03:44:22.88 --> 03:44:23.88
So about halfway through.

4382
03:44:23.88 --> 03:44:27.96
Eric and he had to take it down.

4383
03:44:27.96 --> 03:44:35.16
Yeah, you don't want to let the aesthetic value diminish because of the functional value.

4384
03:44:35.16 --> 03:44:40.08
You seem to say it's not cold or if you're not enduring the elements, you might not need that.

4385
03:44:40.08 --> 03:44:41.40
So I'm going to put that on the side.

4386
03:44:41.40 --> 03:44:42.40
You're going to see.

4387
03:44:42.40 --> 03:44:43.40
So there you go.

4388
03:44:43.40 --> 03:44:44.40
Yeah, YouTube channel.

4389
03:44:44.40 --> 03:44:45.40
Check that out.

4390
03:44:45.40 --> 03:44:46.40
Psychological warfare.

4391
03:44:46.40 --> 03:44:51.28
I think I said we were going to make another one of those like three, four, five years ago.

4392
03:44:51.28 --> 03:44:52.64
That's some point in his job.

4393
03:44:52.64 --> 03:44:53.64
Yeah.

4394
03:44:53.64 --> 03:44:56.28
So it's on canvas.com to go to my American cool stuff.

4395
03:44:56.28 --> 03:44:57.28
Got a bunch of books.

4396
03:44:57.28 --> 03:45:04.44
They're the book to invest in right now and dirt by Cameron Haynes forward written by Joe

4397
03:45:04.44 --> 03:45:07.08
Rogan.

4398
03:45:07.08 --> 03:45:08.08
Freaking great book.

4399
03:45:08.08 --> 03:45:09.72
Lots of knowledge in there.

4400
03:45:09.72 --> 03:45:13.08
Like I said, it's not just about as not just about bow hunting.

4401
03:45:13.08 --> 03:45:16.60
Bohunting is the vehicle for lessons to be learned.

4402
03:45:16.60 --> 03:45:18.20
So check that out.

4403
03:45:18.20 --> 03:45:22.44
Only cry for the living by Holly McCay.

4404
03:45:22.44 --> 03:45:23.44
Here's a book.

4405
03:45:23.44 --> 03:45:25.52
We covered it on this podcast.

4406
03:45:25.52 --> 03:45:29.76
You might want to check into that book, the A-Raw account of war.

4407
03:45:29.76 --> 03:45:38.16
That Holly, who is a badass, risked life and limb to go and capture stories on the ground

4408
03:45:38.16 --> 03:45:39.16
in war.

4409
03:45:39.16 --> 03:45:40.16
So check that out.

4410
03:45:40.16 --> 03:45:41.36
Final spin.

4411
03:45:41.36 --> 03:45:45.000
Leadership strategy in tact is he got all the books I've written.

4412
03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:47.24
If you want them, go get them.

4413
03:45:47.24 --> 03:45:49.20
Ashill on front.

4414
03:45:49.20 --> 03:45:55.88
Just got back from Battlefield out of Gettysburg.

4415
03:45:55.88 --> 03:45:59.92
Power from next up in August is a little big horn.

4416
03:45:59.92 --> 03:46:01.52
We're going to go do the lessons.

4417
03:46:01.52 --> 03:46:04.60
Learn, walk the battlefield, add a little big horn.

4418
03:46:04.60 --> 03:46:09.40
So if you want to check that out, we have a muster coming up in Denver.

4419
03:46:09.40 --> 03:46:14.32
Anyways, if you want to come to an Ashill on front, go to Ashill on front.com.

4420
03:46:14.32 --> 03:46:15.32
Check out the events there.

4421
03:46:15.32 --> 03:46:18.60
Also if you need help in your organization.

4422
03:46:18.60 --> 03:46:20.48
We can give you leadership help.

4423
03:46:20.48 --> 03:46:22.32
That's what we do.

4424
03:46:22.32 --> 03:46:27.16
Also if you can't be online, look, you know how you got to go to the gym.

4425
03:46:27.16 --> 03:46:29.56
If you want to stay in shape, I do.

4426
03:46:29.56 --> 03:46:30.56
Leadership is the same way.

4427
03:46:30.56 --> 03:46:32.88
You're just going to go to the gym one time.

4428
03:46:32.88 --> 03:46:33.88
Now you're good.

4429
03:46:33.88 --> 03:46:36.60
Yeah, not to mention.

4430
03:46:36.60 --> 03:46:40.24
Actually, it might be the same thing, but not to mention where.

4431
03:46:40.24 --> 03:46:44.24
So I've been in this game for a while, been around you for a while.

4432
03:46:44.24 --> 03:46:49.80
And there is stuff within the last one month, actually more than one thing, by the way,

4433
03:46:49.80 --> 03:46:53.64
that hit me in a different way to make me realize it.

4434
03:46:53.64 --> 03:46:58.28
And it's stuff you've been saying in one way or another for the whole time years, by

4435
03:46:58.28 --> 03:46:59.28
the way.

4436
03:46:59.28 --> 03:47:02.68
And then you'll say it a certain way, or you'll interact with someone a certain way,

4437
03:47:02.68 --> 03:47:04.48
and be like, oh, that's what he meant.

4438
03:47:04.48 --> 03:47:09.48
Oh, that's how, you know, so you'll come across things that will be revelations over

4439
03:47:09.48 --> 03:47:10.48
time.

4440
03:47:10.48 --> 03:47:11.48
Yeah.

4441
03:47:11.48 --> 03:47:16.28
Extremeownership.com is about life.

4442
03:47:16.28 --> 03:47:19.40
It's about how to do better in life in a bunch of different ways.

4443
03:47:19.40 --> 03:47:22.68
So if you want to, by the way, if you got a question you want to ask me because going

4444
03:47:22.68 --> 03:47:26.60
there, I'll be alive on a zoom call.

4445
03:47:26.60 --> 03:47:28.04
And you can ask me whatever you want.

4446
03:47:28.04 --> 03:47:29.36
We'll work through it.

4447
03:47:29.36 --> 03:47:35.92
And if you want to help service members, active and retired, if you want to do good, you

4448
03:47:35.92 --> 03:47:42.88
want to provide some medical treatments for service members.

4449
03:47:42.88 --> 03:47:45.88
Go to America's MightyWorriers.org.

4450
03:47:45.88 --> 03:47:48.88
Also check out heroes and horses.org.

4451
03:47:48.88 --> 03:47:52.52
I've been making the mistake of calling it.com.org.org.

4452
03:47:52.52 --> 03:47:54.96
I was texting with Mike at the other day.

4453
03:47:54.96 --> 03:48:01.16
And he's like, you know, he's kind of like, he's kind of like, he goes,

4454
03:48:01.16 --> 03:48:02.16
he appreciates this important.

4455
03:48:02.16 --> 03:48:03.16
It's not work.

4456
03:48:03.16 --> 03:48:04.56
He's so sorry, Mike.

4457
03:48:04.56 --> 03:48:07.32
I'm sorry about that.

4458
03:48:07.32 --> 03:48:10.16
And hey, don't forget you can find Cameron Haynes.

4459
03:48:10.16 --> 03:48:11.16
He's on Instagram.

4460
03:48:11.16 --> 03:48:15.60
He's at Cameron Haynes.

4461
03:48:15.60 --> 03:48:19.24
And he puts up a lot of awesome stuff, puts up a lot of awesome stuff.

4462
03:48:19.24 --> 03:48:21.88
He does a lot of stories.

4463
03:48:21.88 --> 03:48:25.60
So if you want to check that out, give him a look.

4464
03:48:25.60 --> 03:48:28.16
As far as Echo and I go, we're both on Twitter.

4465
03:48:28.16 --> 03:48:29.16
I've been on Twitter.

4466
03:48:29.16 --> 03:48:31.16
Like, I've been back in the game on Twitter.

4467
03:48:31.16 --> 03:48:34.52
Kind of seems like it's moving in the right direction a little bit more.

4468
03:48:34.52 --> 03:48:37.64
It was kind of getting a little sketchy for a while.

4469
03:48:37.64 --> 03:48:41.24
So I've been hammered on Twitter a little bit.

4470
03:48:41.24 --> 03:48:42.24
Echoes there.

4471
03:48:42.24 --> 03:48:43.24
I'm there.

4472
03:48:43.24 --> 03:48:44.24
We're also on Instagram.

4473
03:48:44.24 --> 03:48:45.24
We're also on Facebook.

4474
03:48:45.24 --> 03:48:46.24
Echoes at EchoTrust.

4475
03:48:46.24 --> 03:48:47.24
I'm at Jocquan.

4476
03:48:47.24 --> 03:48:50.28
But once again, watch out.

4477
03:48:50.28 --> 03:48:51.76
The algorithm.

4478
03:48:51.76 --> 03:48:53.80
The free dopamine hits you're getting.

4479
03:48:53.80 --> 03:48:56.20
The dopamine without suffering.

4480
03:48:56.20 --> 03:48:58.84
It's bad for you.

4481
03:48:58.84 --> 03:48:59.84
Watch out for it.

4482
03:48:59.84 --> 03:49:01.04
Don't let it hit you.

4483
03:49:01.04 --> 03:49:03.04
And thanks.

4484
03:49:03.04 --> 03:49:05.56
Once again, campaigns are coming on.

4485
03:49:05.56 --> 03:49:07.36
So many lessons to learn.

4486
03:49:07.36 --> 03:49:09.52
And we appreciate it.

4487
03:49:09.52 --> 03:49:13.92
And it's an honor to be working with you now at Origin Hunt.

4488
03:49:13.92 --> 03:49:19.000
And of course, thanks to Military Personnel, Act of Duty, and Veterans that protect our

4489
03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:20.76
way of life around the world.

4490
03:49:20.76 --> 03:49:23.20
We are forever indebted to you.

4491
03:49:23.20 --> 03:49:30.48
And also thanks to our police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

4492
03:49:30.48 --> 03:49:32.56
correctional officers, board of patrol, secret service.

4493
03:49:32.56 --> 03:49:34.16
All the first responders.

4494
03:49:34.16 --> 03:49:37.76
You make incredible sacrifices to keep us safe here at home.

4495
03:49:37.76 --> 03:49:40.72
And we are grateful for what you do every day.

4496
03:49:40.72 --> 03:49:47.68
And to everyone else dispersed throughout camsbook, our buncha short sections.

4497
03:49:47.68 --> 03:49:54.20
And I didn't cover, I don't think I've covered very, I've covered a couple of them today.

4498
03:49:54.20 --> 03:49:55.76
Actually, no, I don't think I covered any of them.

4499
03:49:55.76 --> 03:50:00.72
But there are these short little sections that provide some insight into cams mindset

4500
03:50:00.72 --> 03:50:06.76
that I think will be helpful to anybody that's trying to get their mind right.

4501
03:50:06.76 --> 03:50:10.44
Here's one of those little sections.

4502
03:50:10.44 --> 03:50:11.44
It goes like this.

4503
03:50:11.44 --> 03:50:14.28
You make a good shot this season.

4504
03:50:14.28 --> 03:50:16.72
Nobody cares or a carger.

4505
03:50:16.72 --> 03:50:18.32
You miss this season.

4506
03:50:18.32 --> 03:50:19.96
Nobody cares or a carger.

4507
03:50:19.96 --> 03:50:21.72
You got a promotion at work.

4508
03:50:21.72 --> 03:50:24.48
Nobody cares or a carger.

4509
03:50:24.48 --> 03:50:26.56
Your dog died.

4510
03:50:26.56 --> 03:50:28.32
Nobody cares or a carger.

4511
03:50:28.32 --> 03:50:29.88
You won the Super Bowl.

4512
03:50:29.88 --> 03:50:31.12
Nobody cares.

4513
03:50:31.12 --> 03:50:33.60
Work harder.

4514
03:50:33.60 --> 03:50:36.16
Nobody really cares about your goals.

4515
03:50:36.16 --> 03:50:41.84
Nobody cares about your excuses for not achieving recent success.

4516
03:50:41.84 --> 03:50:44.60
Yesterday means nothing.

4517
03:50:44.60 --> 03:50:46.44
Recent failure.

4518
03:50:46.44 --> 03:50:50.04
Yesterday means nothing.

4519
03:50:50.04 --> 03:50:53.44
Give all you have today.

4520
03:50:53.44 --> 03:50:56.68
What you've accomplished in the past means nothing.

4521
03:50:56.68 --> 03:50:58.80
We don't rest on laurels.

4522
03:50:58.80 --> 03:51:04.08
It is time to work.

4523
03:51:04.08 --> 03:51:31.04
And until next time, Zekko and Joko out.
