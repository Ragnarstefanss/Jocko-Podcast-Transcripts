and three children, Riley, Andrew, and Madeline.

44
00:02:40.16 --> 00:02:44.08
And his friends that served with him alongside him

45
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:47.16
called him the real Captain America.

46
00:02:51.16 --> 00:02:53.72
And in early July, 2020,

47
00:02:53.72 --> 00:02:56.60
he sent some of those friends a message.

48
00:02:58.68 --> 00:03:00.32
He said, text me.

49
00:03:00.32 --> 00:03:02.000
I told you before, my door's open.

50
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.34
My phone is at hand.

51
00:03:04.40 --> 00:03:06.64
We did things that people make movies about

52
00:03:06.64 --> 00:03:09.28
and in some cases, writers and producers

53
00:03:09.28 --> 00:03:14.28
wouldn't even try to write our story.

54
00:03:14.28 --> 00:03:16.88
But the Rucksack is heavy.

55
00:03:16.88 --> 00:03:20.64
And when it gets heavy, we help each other.

56
00:03:20.64 --> 00:03:23.36
But you have to reach out.

57
00:03:23.36 --> 00:03:25.36
Don't let the valley win.

58
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:34.56
So that's Andrew Marcosano.

59
00:03:34.56 --> 00:03:39.56
The kind of guy that we all look up to.

60
00:03:44.24 --> 00:03:46.16
Kind of guy that's looking out for us.

61
00:03:46.16 --> 00:03:50.32
Kind of guy that we see as strong and unflappable.

62
00:03:52.08 --> 00:03:55.44
Kind of guy that's helping others

63
00:03:55.44 --> 00:03:59.36
and of course couldn't possibly need any help himself.

64
00:03:59.36 --> 00:04:02.56
But a few days after sending that message

65
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:05.56
to his friends and comrades on July 6th, 2020,

66
00:04:07.76 --> 00:04:10.56
Andy Marcosano killed himself.

67
00:04:18.16 --> 00:04:22.16
Which is a nightmare.

68
00:04:22.16 --> 00:04:27.16
And it's only one of thousands of these cases.

69
00:04:31.36 --> 00:04:33.96
And we've talked about some of them on this podcast.

70
00:04:33.96 --> 00:04:36.76
We talked to Sarah Wilkinson about her husband Chad,

71
00:04:39.56 --> 00:04:42.36
who committed suicide after multiple combat deployments

72
00:04:42.36 --> 00:04:43.36
with the SEAL teams.

73
00:04:43.36 --> 00:04:44.96
We talked with Mike Hayes.

74
00:04:44.96 --> 00:04:46.96
We talked to Mike Hayes.

75
00:04:46.96 --> 00:04:48.96
We talked to Mike Hayes.

76
00:04:48.96 --> 00:04:50.96
We talked to Mike Hayes.

77
00:04:50.96 --> 00:04:53.56
We talked to Mike Hayes about a friend of ours

78
00:04:53.56 --> 00:04:55.56
named Joe Price, another SEAL.

79
00:04:57.56 --> 00:05:02.56
This one who killed himself in the middle of a deployment.

80
00:05:06.16 --> 00:05:08.56
And the list goes on and on in every branch.

81
00:05:08.56 --> 00:05:10.56
And it's not a new problem.

82
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:15.56
On this podcast, we discussed Charles White, Wittlesley.

83
00:05:15.56 --> 00:05:18.56
Medal of Honor recipient, World War I,

84
00:05:20.76 --> 00:05:22.76
who killed himself after returning home.

85
00:05:27.76 --> 00:05:31.76
We discussed the awful suicide of Lewis Puller Jr.,

86
00:05:31.76 --> 00:05:33.76
son of Chesty Puller,

87
00:05:35.76 --> 00:05:39.76
who was wounded in Vietnam and fought off the darkness

88
00:05:39.76 --> 00:05:45.76
for 25 years before finally losing his battle with the demons.

89
00:05:53.36 --> 00:05:57.36
But there are people that overcome.

90
00:05:58.76 --> 00:06:02.76
There are people that find a way to push through

91
00:06:02.76 --> 00:06:09.76
and push on and begin to truly live again.

92
00:06:09.76 --> 00:06:12.76
And there are many ways to get there.

93
00:06:12.76 --> 00:06:19.76
And tonight, it's an honor to have Amber and Marcus Capone

94
00:06:19.76 --> 00:06:23.76
with us, two people who have found a path.

95
00:06:25.76 --> 00:06:28.76
A path out of the darkness, a path toward the light,

96
00:06:28.76 --> 00:06:30.76
and they're doing their best to show them

97
00:06:30.76 --> 00:06:32.76
a path toward the light, and they're doing their best

98
00:06:32.76 --> 00:06:35.76
to share it with as many people as they can.

99
00:06:35.76 --> 00:06:37.76
Marcus was a seal.

100
00:06:37.76 --> 00:06:44.76
For 13 years, completed multiple deployments overseas,

101
00:06:44.76 --> 00:06:51.76
and his wife, Amber, also here, who stuck with him

102
00:06:51.76 --> 00:06:53.76
through all that and much more.

103
00:06:53.76 --> 00:06:56.76
And from everything I can tell,

104
00:06:56.76 --> 00:07:00.76
she eventually saved him from himself.

105
00:07:00.76 --> 00:07:06.76
Amber, Marcus, thanks for coming on.

106
00:07:06.76 --> 00:07:08.76
I know it's a heavy topic, and I know you are

107
00:07:08.76 --> 00:07:10.76
in the trenches every day dealing with this

108
00:07:10.76 --> 00:07:12.76
and trying to help people out.

109
00:07:12.76 --> 00:07:16.76
So thanks for coming on here to share your story

110
00:07:16.76 --> 00:07:20.76
and hopefully guide some other people in the right direction.

111
00:07:20.76 --> 00:07:23.76
I guess we just start at the beginning.

112
00:07:23.76 --> 00:07:28.76
I guess start with Marcus, your childhood,

113
00:07:28.76 --> 00:07:31.76
where'd you grow up, what was that all about?

114
00:07:31.76 --> 00:07:33.76
Well first, thanks for that introduction.

115
00:07:33.76 --> 00:07:35.76
That was, wow.

116
00:07:35.76 --> 00:07:37.76
Just, wow.

117
00:07:37.76 --> 00:07:41.76
Yeah, one of my most, you know,

118
00:07:41.76 --> 00:07:45.76
every single Marine knows who Chesty Puller is.

119
00:07:45.76 --> 00:07:48.76
Probably the most iconic Marine of all time,

120
00:07:48.76 --> 00:07:51.76
if not, he's definitely in the top two or three.

121
00:07:51.76 --> 00:07:54.76
And yet no one knows about his son.

122
00:07:54.76 --> 00:07:57.76
Or, I shouldn't say no one, very few people know about his son.

123
00:07:57.76 --> 00:08:03.76
And it's, I think it's one of the most tragic stories in history

124
00:08:03.76 --> 00:08:05.76
about what happened to his son.

125
00:08:05.76 --> 00:08:09.76
And Lewis Puller Jr. coming out of Vietnam,

126
00:08:09.76 --> 00:08:14.76
so severely wounded, but I mean, he kind of got it together

127
00:08:14.76 --> 00:08:17.76
eventually and wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book,

128
00:08:17.76 --> 00:08:18.76
which is an incredible book.

129
00:08:18.76 --> 00:08:22.76
And it just kind of fell apart at the end.

130
00:08:22.76 --> 00:08:26.76
And we should, that should be, you know,

131
00:08:26.76 --> 00:08:28.76
people should know at least as much about him

132
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:30.76
as they do about his dad.

133
00:08:30.76 --> 00:08:34.76
Because if that's not a warning, then I don't know what is.

134
00:08:34.76 --> 00:08:38.76
Yeah, Jaco, I think that's a good point.

135
00:08:38.76 --> 00:08:41.76
And that story in particular is that, you know,

136
00:08:41.76 --> 00:08:43.76
I'm good right now and guys are good,

137
00:08:43.76 --> 00:08:46.76
but it took him, you know, 25 years.

138
00:08:46.76 --> 00:08:49.76
You know, he wrote Pulitzer Prize book,

139
00:08:49.76 --> 00:08:51.76
seemed like he was okay,

140
00:08:51.76 --> 00:08:54.76
but I feel we've all come to this point

141
00:08:54.76 --> 00:08:57.76
and even, you know, you go do this treatment

142
00:08:57.76 --> 00:08:59.76
that we're going to talk about.

143
00:08:59.76 --> 00:09:01.76
It doesn't mean you're healed forever.

144
00:09:01.76 --> 00:09:03.76
You don't go to the gym or go downstairs to work out

145
00:09:03.76 --> 00:09:05.76
and think you're going to be a black belt for a day

146
00:09:05.76 --> 00:09:07.76
or you're trying every day, right?

147
00:09:07.76 --> 00:09:09.76
And so I think in this healing process,

148
00:09:09.76 --> 00:09:12.76
it's, you know, I don't want to call us damaged,

149
00:09:12.76 --> 00:09:14.76
but we came to a point where we needed some help

150
00:09:14.76 --> 00:09:16.76
to climb out of some darkness.

151
00:09:16.76 --> 00:09:18.76
And so I have to work on it every day,

152
00:09:18.76 --> 00:09:21.76
literally every day, probably forever.

153
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:24.76
And so I, you know, you mentioning that story,

154
00:09:24.76 --> 00:09:26.76
I think it's important for people to hear like,

155
00:09:26.76 --> 00:09:29.76
this is not a one and done, there's not a panacea.

156
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:31.76
You know, this is forever, right?

157
00:09:31.76 --> 00:09:32.76
And this is forever.

158
00:09:32.76 --> 00:09:35.76
And so we got to work on ourselves every day forever.

159
00:09:35.76 --> 00:09:38.76
Otherwise, you know, we don't want to end up,

160
00:09:38.76 --> 00:09:41.76
you know, underground too early.

161
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:45.76
Yeah.

162
00:09:45.76 --> 00:09:47.76
So let's talk about how you got here,

163
00:09:47.76 --> 00:09:49.76
how you got here sitting here today.

164
00:09:49.76 --> 00:09:50.76
Where'd you grow up?

165
00:09:50.76 --> 00:09:51.76
Yeah.

166
00:09:51.76 --> 00:09:54.76
So I was born in Queens, New York.

167
00:09:54.76 --> 00:09:57.76
I moved to the island when I was at Long Island,

168
00:09:57.76 --> 00:09:58.76
when I was three.

169
00:09:58.76 --> 00:10:05.76
And, you know, I thought I was just like a typical Long Island kid.

170
00:10:05.76 --> 00:10:09.76
I played everything, you know, my dad and my grandfather

171
00:10:09.76 --> 00:10:14.76
both played college sports, basketball, baseball, football.

172
00:10:14.76 --> 00:10:18.76
So I literally, I think I had a ball in my hand at, you know,

173
00:10:18.76 --> 00:10:19.76
two or three years old.

174
00:10:19.76 --> 00:10:21.76
I was on skis at three.

175
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:24.76
I was in the water at four.

176
00:10:24.76 --> 00:10:28.76
We had one of the top wrestling programs in New York.

177
00:10:28.76 --> 00:10:30.76
And so I was like on a mat at like seven, you know,

178
00:10:30.76 --> 00:10:32.76
in most of those places you didn't get to wrestle

179
00:10:32.76 --> 00:10:34.76
like junior high or maybe even high school.

180
00:10:34.76 --> 00:10:37.76
And so, you know, I was lucky.

181
00:10:37.76 --> 00:10:40.76
And I grew up in a beach town in Long Beach, New York.

182
00:10:40.76 --> 00:10:43.76
And so, you know, I was always in the water, always on the beach.

183
00:10:43.76 --> 00:10:46.76
I was a lifeguard at 16.

184
00:10:46.76 --> 00:10:48.76
Yeah, I mean, I thought life was good.

185
00:10:48.76 --> 00:10:51.76
And, you know, I know that sounds like a pretty freaking good life.

186
00:10:51.76 --> 00:10:52.76
No, I mean, it was good.

187
00:10:52.76 --> 00:10:54.76
At least I thought it was good.

188
00:10:54.76 --> 00:10:59.76
Both your, both your, your, your dad and your granddad were athletes.

189
00:10:59.76 --> 00:11:01.76
When you said like, yeah, they were athletes.

190
00:11:01.76 --> 00:11:05.76
My, my grandfather was an all state basketball player.

191
00:11:05.76 --> 00:11:09.76
And he was a white dude too from New York, which is, you know, play basketball.

192
00:11:09.76 --> 00:11:11.76
And I mean, I'll brag.

193
00:11:11.76 --> 00:11:14.76
I think New York's got some of the best basketball in the world.

194
00:11:14.76 --> 00:11:17.76
So, you know, we, we played, played in tough leagues.

195
00:11:17.76 --> 00:11:21.76
And then my dad was more football and baseball.

196
00:11:21.76 --> 00:11:25.76
So he, he started as a freshman in high school,

197
00:11:25.76 --> 00:11:27.76
which was huge in the Catholic high school league.

198
00:11:27.76 --> 00:11:31.76
So I went to all boys Catholic high school where he went Holy Cross and fleshing.

199
00:11:31.76 --> 00:11:33.76
There's a shout out.

200
00:11:33.76 --> 00:11:37.76
And, yeah, so I just, I'm caught out for that all boys scenario.

201
00:11:37.76 --> 00:11:38.76
Yeah.

202
00:11:38.76 --> 00:11:40.76
Well, maybe it's why I'm here today.

203
00:11:40.76 --> 00:11:42.76
Who knows?

204
00:11:42.76 --> 00:11:44.76
Hey, what about like grades and stuff?

205
00:11:44.76 --> 00:11:45.76
Were you doing good in school?

206
00:11:45.76 --> 00:11:46.76
I was, I was good in school.

207
00:11:46.76 --> 00:11:51.76
I was really good up until high school and I slipped a little bit.

208
00:11:51.76 --> 00:11:52.76
So I was like a straight,

209
00:11:52.76 --> 00:11:54.76
Were you still in an all boys school in high school?

210
00:11:54.76 --> 00:11:55.76
Yeah.

211
00:11:55.76 --> 00:11:56.76
High school was all boys.

212
00:11:56.76 --> 00:11:59.76
So I went to public grammar and middle school in Long Island.

213
00:11:59.76 --> 00:12:03.76
And then I went to all boys Catholic high school in back in New York.

214
00:12:03.76 --> 00:12:05.76
So I took the train for an hour every day.

215
00:12:05.76 --> 00:12:10.76
The football coach at the time would pick me up in Valley Stream.

216
00:12:10.76 --> 00:12:11.76
So what year is this?

217
00:12:11.76 --> 00:12:13.76
So this is 90,

218
00:12:13.76 --> 00:12:14.76
Like what year do you graduate from?

219
00:12:14.76 --> 00:12:15.76
94.

220
00:12:15.76 --> 00:12:16.76
Okay.

221
00:12:16.76 --> 00:12:17.76
Yeah.

222
00:12:17.76 --> 00:12:21.76
And so, yeah, I would, I would take the train at like 5.50 in the morning.

223
00:12:21.76 --> 00:12:26.76
He'd pick me up at 6.30 the coach and then he'd drive me in the rest of the way.

224
00:12:26.76 --> 00:12:29.76
So that was just normal back then.

225
00:12:29.76 --> 00:12:32.76
You know, some people don't understand it now,

226
00:12:32.76 --> 00:12:37.76
but the Catholic high school league in everything was good.

227
00:12:37.76 --> 00:12:41.76
And I didn't, I grew up in a town that didn't have a great public high school.

228
00:12:41.76 --> 00:12:45.76
And again, I was, you know, I was all about sports.

229
00:12:45.76 --> 00:12:49.76
So wherever they had the best sports, I was, I was going, I was going.

230
00:12:49.76 --> 00:12:51.76
What'd your dad do for a living?

231
00:12:51.76 --> 00:12:58.76
Um, you know, he, he kind of just a bit of a hustler really never,

232
00:12:58.76 --> 00:13:00.76
um, never finished college.

233
00:13:00.76 --> 00:13:02.76
Men's a smart though.

234
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:03.76
Super smart.

235
00:13:03.76 --> 00:13:06.76
You know, it was really into the market and, but just never applied himself.

236
00:13:06.76 --> 00:13:14.76
Um, he, uh, he wind up, I think the last 20 years, he was a bridge operator.

237
00:13:14.76 --> 00:13:19.76
So he literally open and close a drawbridge in the county and, you know,

238
00:13:19.76 --> 00:13:22.76
he worked for the county and had benefits.

239
00:13:22.76 --> 00:13:27.76
The funny thing is whenever my, I think my uncle Shane asked me,

240
00:13:27.76 --> 00:13:29.76
what does Marcus's dad do?

241
00:13:29.76 --> 00:13:32.76
And I asked you or asked him or something and he goes,

242
00:13:32.76 --> 00:13:34.76
tell him I work for the union.

243
00:13:34.76 --> 00:13:35.76
Just leave it at that.

244
00:13:35.76 --> 00:13:36.76
Yeah.

245
00:13:36.76 --> 00:13:37.76
For the union.

246
00:13:37.76 --> 00:13:41.76
Well, he used to tell people he was a bridge engineer.

247
00:13:41.76 --> 00:13:45.76
It sounded better than telling him that he was, uh, opening and closing a drawbridge.

248
00:13:45.76 --> 00:13:49.76
And, um, and then on the side, he moonlighted.

249
00:13:49.76 --> 00:13:51.76
He, um, he drove for people.

250
00:13:51.76 --> 00:13:56.76
So he would drive for, um, elected officials.

251
00:13:56.76 --> 00:13:57.76
Yeah.

252
00:13:57.76 --> 00:14:01.76
But, um, who I'm, I'm drawing a blank from New York.

253
00:14:01.76 --> 00:14:02.76
Some like governor.

254
00:14:02.76 --> 00:14:03.76
Yeah.

255
00:14:03.76 --> 00:14:04.76
Yeah.

256
00:14:04.76 --> 00:14:06.76
You know, just a few like kind of local.

257
00:14:06.76 --> 00:14:09.76
So he had like a link, he had like a town Lincoln town car and he was getting out.

258
00:14:09.76 --> 00:14:13.76
Literally had a square Lincoln town car that was handed down to me.

259
00:14:13.76 --> 00:14:14.76
Yeah.

260
00:14:14.76 --> 00:14:16.76
And he was like, Hey, sucked gas.

261
00:14:16.76 --> 00:14:17.76
It was awesome.

262
00:14:17.76 --> 00:14:19.76
I love that thing.

263
00:14:19.76 --> 00:14:20.76
Hey, what about your mom?

264
00:14:20.76 --> 00:14:21.76
Lincoln town car.

265
00:14:21.76 --> 00:14:22.76
Was she around?

266
00:14:22.76 --> 00:14:23.76
You hit it right on the head.

267
00:14:23.76 --> 00:14:24.76
Yeah.

268
00:14:24.76 --> 00:14:25.76
Yeah.

269
00:14:25.76 --> 00:14:26.76
Mom worked for a dentist for over 30 years.

270
00:14:26.76 --> 00:14:31.76
So she was, uh, she was at the front answering the phone, you know, paying the bills, greeting

271
00:14:31.76 --> 00:14:32.76
everyone.

272
00:14:32.76 --> 00:14:35.76
So I had free, free dental growing up, which is nice.

273
00:14:35.76 --> 00:14:36.76
Right.

274
00:14:36.76 --> 00:14:37.76
And what about brothers and sisters?

275
00:14:37.76 --> 00:14:38.76
None.

276
00:14:38.76 --> 00:14:39.76
You're only child.

277
00:14:39.76 --> 00:14:40.76
I was only child.

278
00:14:40.76 --> 00:14:42.76
I had a, I have a half sister I've never met.

279
00:14:42.76 --> 00:14:47.76
Um, and well, I can't remember.

280
00:14:47.76 --> 00:14:51.76
Well, I mean, I, I mean, I've never, I can't, I don't remember that.

281
00:14:51.76 --> 00:14:54.76
So it was like lesson one when I think they separated us.

282
00:14:54.76 --> 00:14:56.76
But, uh, you know, then that was just me.

283
00:14:56.76 --> 00:14:58.76
So spoiled, spoiled only child.

284
00:14:58.76 --> 00:15:00.76
And the focus was just on sports.

285
00:15:00.76 --> 00:15:06.76
It was all on sports and, you know, in academics, my dad was, he was an academic and, you know,

286
00:15:06.76 --> 00:15:11.76
I would literally get like backhanded if I came home with like, you know, a B.

287
00:15:11.76 --> 00:15:13.76
That's the part of his childhood.

288
00:15:13.76 --> 00:15:14.76
Yeah.

289
00:15:14.76 --> 00:15:17.76
It's the part that, you know, that may not have been very, very hard dad.

290
00:15:17.76 --> 00:15:18.76
Yeah.

291
00:15:18.76 --> 00:15:19.76
Dad was hard, right?

292
00:15:19.76 --> 00:15:20.76
So, um,

293
00:15:20.76 --> 00:15:21.76
What do you think was driving that in your dad?

294
00:15:21.76 --> 00:15:24.76
Cause it sounds like he's kind of laid back in a way or is he just pouring all of his

295
00:15:24.76 --> 00:15:25.76
dreams into you?

296
00:15:25.76 --> 00:15:27.76
I think that I think you hit it.

297
00:15:27.76 --> 00:15:28.76
I think you hit that on that.

298
00:15:28.76 --> 00:15:29.76
Yeah.

299
00:15:29.76 --> 00:15:30.76
My parents went to Woodstock.

300
00:15:30.76 --> 00:15:33.76
I mean, they were like, they were like hippies, sort of hippies, you know, mom used to protest

301
00:15:33.76 --> 00:15:34.76
the war.

302
00:15:34.76 --> 00:15:40.76
Um, but yeah, he had like a real mean side and his grant, his dad, my grandfather was

303
00:15:40.76 --> 00:15:41.76
a cleaner.

304
00:15:41.76 --> 00:15:46.92
Um, I think he told me what before noon, he'd already, he would already drank like two

305
00:15:46.92 --> 00:15:49.76
quarts of beer, you know, quarts back in the day.

306
00:15:49.76 --> 00:15:54.76
Um, and then he owned, they owned, uh, like his family owned a bunch of the, um, I guess

307
00:15:54.76 --> 00:15:56.76
a medallion like a cabs in New York.

308
00:15:56.76 --> 00:15:57.76
Oh yeah.

309
00:15:57.76 --> 00:15:59.76
You know, components from New York, right?

310
00:15:59.76 --> 00:16:02.76
Um, and so I don't know how he was treated as a kid.

311
00:16:02.76 --> 00:16:06.76
Well, I'll tell you how he was sent away to boarding school.

312
00:16:06.76 --> 00:16:07.76
All boys.

313
00:16:07.76 --> 00:16:08.76
This is your dad.

314
00:16:08.76 --> 00:16:13.76
This is my dad in the Bronx at four years old.

315
00:16:13.76 --> 00:16:18.28
So I mean, if you and I think back at four kind of love we had from our parents, his

316
00:16:18.28 --> 00:16:23.24
sent him away, uh, to Catholic boarding school in the Bronx.

317
00:16:23.24 --> 00:16:30.56
And I could just imagine what went on there from, you know, some of the, some of the individuals

318
00:16:30.56 --> 00:16:33.000
that, you know, we're hearing about now all these stories these days.

319
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.48
So maybe he had some shit, uh, that he was, he was getting out on me, um, possibly.

320
00:16:39.48 --> 00:16:44.08
But he, but it sounds like he just wanted you to be successful in a big way.

321
00:16:44.08 --> 00:16:45.08
It was all about me.

322
00:16:45.08 --> 00:16:46.08
Yeah.

323
00:16:46.08 --> 00:16:52.16
He like, they hung up their life to, he was at every practice literally, um, you know,

324
00:16:52.16 --> 00:16:54.04
right there, cheering, watching.

325
00:16:54.04 --> 00:16:56.08
Did he yell at the ref?

326
00:16:56.08 --> 00:16:57.08
Yelling.

327
00:16:57.08 --> 00:16:58.08
No, that was my mom.

328
00:16:58.08 --> 00:16:59.08
Okay.

329
00:16:59.08 --> 00:17:03.52
So no, he would, he would backhand me if, if something just didn't seem right.

330
00:17:03.52 --> 00:17:08.04
And she would get thrown out of the little league world series because she was screaming

331
00:17:08.04 --> 00:17:12.40
at the freaking umpire about a call and they actually did get thrown out.

332
00:17:12.40 --> 00:17:15.16
Like she had to leave the stadium in the little league.

333
00:17:15.16 --> 00:17:16.16
I say hell yeah.

334
00:17:16.16 --> 00:17:21.28
I like people, I don't know why people get the impression that I would like be, uh, yelling

335
00:17:21.28 --> 00:17:24.84
and screaming, but I'd never like for my kids played sports.

336
00:17:24.84 --> 00:17:26.08
I would just, I wouldn't say anything.

337
00:17:26.08 --> 00:17:27.08
I wouldn't even coach them.

338
00:17:27.08 --> 00:17:29.04
I wouldn't even, but well, maybe occasionally.

339
00:17:29.04 --> 00:17:32.56
But most of the time I would just sit there and watch because it's hard to coach your

340
00:17:32.56 --> 00:17:33.56
own kids, man.

341
00:17:33.56 --> 00:17:36.56
They don't, they don't really want to listen to you.

342
00:17:36.56 --> 00:17:40.60
So no, no, no matter how much you know, you're just telling me the story downstairs.

343
00:17:40.60 --> 00:17:41.60
Yeah.

344
00:17:41.60 --> 00:17:42.60
Yeah.

345
00:17:42.60 --> 00:17:43.60
Yeah.

346
00:17:43.60 --> 00:17:45.72
I was telling him, my son was doing Jiu-Jitsu.

347
00:17:45.72 --> 00:17:46.88
I've been doing Jiu-Jitsu at this point.

348
00:17:46.88 --> 00:17:50.64
I've been doing Jiu-Jitsu for like 25 years and my son, I'm watching him roll and he's

349
00:17:50.64 --> 00:17:54.04
got an arm lock on somebody and I say, Hey, you know, you need to get your hips a little

350
00:17:54.04 --> 00:17:55.28
further underneath that elbow.

351
00:17:55.28 --> 00:17:57.76
And he looks at me and he goes, No, you don't.

352
00:17:57.76 --> 00:17:59.88
Okay, fair enough.

353
00:17:59.88 --> 00:18:00.96
Oh, bastard.

354
00:18:00.96 --> 00:18:03.24
I'm not going to listen to anything.

355
00:18:03.24 --> 00:18:06.04
But so you, your grades are good.

356
00:18:06.04 --> 00:18:07.04
Yeah.

357
00:18:07.04 --> 00:18:09.56
You sound like a freaking good model kid.

358
00:18:09.56 --> 00:18:11.92
I was a good kid, but I think that was the problem too.

359
00:18:11.92 --> 00:18:14.76
I was like, I was, I was, I was too nice.

360
00:18:14.76 --> 00:18:16.48
I'm still a little too nice.

361
00:18:16.48 --> 00:18:19.88
But yeah, so I got, you know, I was skinny too.

362
00:18:19.88 --> 00:18:26.16
So I was skinny, nice kid that also got put ahead, not held back like, like we do in Texas.

363
00:18:26.16 --> 00:18:27.16
We hold back our kids.

364
00:18:27.16 --> 00:18:28.16
We hold back in Texas.

365
00:18:28.16 --> 00:18:30.16
The kids like 17 years old, grown as fresh.

366
00:18:30.16 --> 00:18:31.16
Absolutely.

367
00:18:31.16 --> 00:18:34.76
Well, I mean, I mean, you have to, our son graduated with someone who was turning 20.

368
00:18:34.76 --> 00:18:35.76
Yeah.

369
00:18:35.76 --> 00:18:39.80
I mean, you have to, you know, you have to pass for 3000 yards, you know, they call

370
00:18:39.80 --> 00:18:41.28
the Texas gray shirt.

371
00:18:41.28 --> 00:18:45.88
No, instead I got put ahead early for whatever reason.

372
00:18:45.88 --> 00:18:50.48
And so I was with older kids, skinny, nice kid.

373
00:18:50.48 --> 00:18:54.44
And yeah, I got, I definitely got abused.

374
00:18:54.44 --> 00:18:56.40
Just picked on, picked on constantly.

375
00:18:56.40 --> 00:18:57.40
What kind of music?

376
00:18:57.40 --> 00:18:58.40
I think some people call that right of passage.

377
00:18:58.40 --> 00:19:00.76
I think there's a little bit of both.

378
00:19:00.76 --> 00:19:02.08
But it wasn't fun.

379
00:19:02.08 --> 00:19:05.88
What kind of music did you like?

380
00:19:05.88 --> 00:19:17.92
Growing up in New York, like Queens, everything, rap, like Beastie Boys, right from Brooklyn.

381
00:19:17.92 --> 00:19:19.60
Guns and Roses.

382
00:19:19.60 --> 00:19:26.28
So just you kind of normal music for late 80s, early 90s, get some.

383
00:19:26.28 --> 00:19:27.28
Yeah.

384
00:19:27.28 --> 00:19:33.08
And then I got into like some other stuff in high school, like trying to think like kind

385
00:19:33.08 --> 00:19:39.84
of Lollapalooza, ESC, music, Pro Jam, you know, everything that was coming out of Seattle.

386
00:19:39.84 --> 00:19:41.32
So all that stuff was good.

387
00:19:41.32 --> 00:19:44.14
Cause that stuff made it mainstream in the early 90s.

388
00:19:44.14 --> 00:19:45.72
So you could, you could pick up on it.

389
00:19:45.72 --> 00:19:46.72
Yeah.

390
00:19:46.72 --> 00:19:48.56
Even in a big, big, big, big, school.

391
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:49.56
All boys school.

392
00:19:49.56 --> 00:19:53.16
Boys Catholic High School and Queens.

393
00:19:53.16 --> 00:19:55.88
And was all this geared towards you going to college to play sports?

394
00:19:55.88 --> 00:19:56.88
Yes.

395
00:19:56.88 --> 00:19:57.88
It actually was.

396
00:19:57.88 --> 00:19:58.88
That's all we talked about.

397
00:19:58.88 --> 00:19:59.88
I mean, that's all I knew.

398
00:19:59.88 --> 00:20:00.88
Were you going to camps?

399
00:20:00.88 --> 00:20:07.60
I was going to camps every summer from the, I can't even remember, Jack, that's how I

400
00:20:07.60 --> 00:20:08.60
fought back.

401
00:20:08.60 --> 00:20:17.28
I was either in a basketball camp or a football camp at Fordham or a baseball camp, junior

402
00:20:17.28 --> 00:20:19.80
lifeguards, like just all that shit.

403
00:20:19.80 --> 00:20:20.80
Yeah.

404
00:20:20.80 --> 00:20:22.96
And what, what did you, what sport did you like the best?

405
00:20:22.96 --> 00:20:23.96
I liked football.

406
00:20:23.96 --> 00:20:26.40
And is that, is that the one you were best at as well?

407
00:20:26.40 --> 00:20:27.40
That's the one I was best at.

408
00:20:27.40 --> 00:20:29.000
I played in college for her dad.

409
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
We'll get into that later.

410
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.60
But yeah, I got full scholarship to play.

411
00:20:33.60 --> 00:20:36.76
Definitely beat your body up, of course, but I just, I don't know, it was one of those

412
00:20:36.76 --> 00:20:38.96
things I liked.

413
00:20:38.96 --> 00:20:43.04
I was a quarterback from, I think like seven years old.

414
00:20:43.04 --> 00:20:46.20
And you know, I think it was up to me.

415
00:20:46.20 --> 00:20:50.84
I'd probably be surfing and I tried because we, because we did live in a beach town and

416
00:20:50.84 --> 00:20:53.72
my dad was like not having it at all.

417
00:20:53.72 --> 00:20:58.16
So I would try to surf and then immediately like we'd go right into, you know, some kind

418
00:20:58.16 --> 00:21:04.96
of camp or, you know, baseball double headers in Brooklyn, you know, at 90 degrees in the

419
00:21:04.96 --> 00:21:07.04
middle of summer type shit.

420
00:21:07.04 --> 00:21:08.04
Check.

421
00:21:08.04 --> 00:21:09.04
All right.

422
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:10.04
Amber, your turn.

423
00:21:10.04 --> 00:21:16.36
Well, I entered the picture at the football juncture where my dad recruited him, but prior

424
00:21:16.36 --> 00:21:19.56
to that, you must have been doing something prior to that.

425
00:21:19.56 --> 00:21:20.56
What were you doing?

426
00:21:20.56 --> 00:21:21.56
Yeah.

427
00:21:21.56 --> 00:21:23.68
Prior to that, I grew up in a really small town in Southern Illinois.

428
00:21:23.68 --> 00:21:27.88
So everyone, when I say I'm from Illinois, I think Chicago, but I've actually only been

429
00:21:27.88 --> 00:21:30.44
to Chicago one time in my life.

430
00:21:30.44 --> 00:21:36.000
I grew up on a retired dairy farm in a very rural part of Illinois.

431
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.40
Retired dairy farm, meaning there's no more cows there.

432
00:21:38.40 --> 00:21:39.40
Yeah.

433
00:21:39.40 --> 00:21:42.20
It's not, there's, there was, all the barns were still there.

434
00:21:42.20 --> 00:21:43.44
The milk house was there.

435
00:21:43.44 --> 00:21:45.40
The farm house was there.

436
00:21:45.40 --> 00:21:46.84
All the land was there.

437
00:21:46.84 --> 00:21:49.32
Was it your family's that retired it?

438
00:21:49.32 --> 00:21:50.32
Yes.

439
00:21:50.32 --> 00:21:57.12
Great grandfather, great, great and great grandfathers were the milk men of my county.

440
00:21:57.12 --> 00:22:00.16
And then they shut it down at some point.

441
00:22:00.16 --> 00:22:01.16
Yeah.

442
00:22:01.16 --> 00:22:03.92
So they had, I don't even know how many, you know, hundreds of cows.

443
00:22:03.92 --> 00:22:07.04
My grandfather worked the farm whenever he was in high school.

444
00:22:07.04 --> 00:22:12.20
And then at some point shortly thereafter, he was like their farmhand and he ended up

445
00:22:12.20 --> 00:22:15.96
going to college and getting married to my grandmother.

446
00:22:15.96 --> 00:22:18.92
And I think at some point they retired it after that.

447
00:22:18.92 --> 00:22:21.92
And did your dad have to work on the dairy farm at all or was it already done?

448
00:22:21.92 --> 00:22:23.76
That was my mom's dad.

449
00:22:23.76 --> 00:22:26.60
My dad's dad owned an excavating business.

450
00:22:26.60 --> 00:22:27.60
Oh, God.

451
00:22:27.60 --> 00:22:30.28
And yes, my dad and his brothers worked the tractors.

452
00:22:30.28 --> 00:22:32.76
So I come from a very hardworking family.

453
00:22:32.76 --> 00:22:36.28
Yeah, dairy farmers, that's a hard life, man.

454
00:22:36.28 --> 00:22:37.28
Yeah.

455
00:22:37.28 --> 00:22:38.28
It's a hard life.

456
00:22:38.28 --> 00:22:40.64
But like a really good wholesome life.

457
00:22:40.64 --> 00:22:45.40
And I just grew up in a really wholesome family and a really wholesome town.

458
00:22:45.40 --> 00:22:54.20
And my dad being a football coach just really always drove me, loved me, but drove me.

459
00:22:54.20 --> 00:23:00.28
And like he, the one thing he taught me was don't you ever quit anything.

460
00:23:00.28 --> 00:23:01.64
Don't ever quit.

461
00:23:01.64 --> 00:23:06.04
And so, you know, it didn't matter how uncomfortable things got in my mind.

462
00:23:06.04 --> 00:23:07.64
I'm like, I'm not quitting.

463
00:23:07.64 --> 00:23:09.16
I don't have a quit in me.

464
00:23:09.16 --> 00:23:10.96
Did you play sports?

465
00:23:10.96 --> 00:23:11.96
I was a cheerleader.

466
00:23:11.96 --> 00:23:12.96
Right.

467
00:23:12.96 --> 00:23:18.04
I would have been more athletic had my dad been in my life, my parents.

468
00:23:18.04 --> 00:23:21.24
He was in my life, but not in like a dad way.

469
00:23:21.24 --> 00:23:23.92
You know, he was, my parents were divorced.

470
00:23:23.92 --> 00:23:29.08
So I saw him spring break, a couple of months during the summer, over Christmas.

471
00:23:29.08 --> 00:23:32.04
But you know, day to day I was raised by my mom.

472
00:23:32.04 --> 00:23:35.96
And how long did you cheerleading for?

473
00:23:35.96 --> 00:23:41.04
From the time I was in seventh grade to senior in high school.

474
00:23:41.04 --> 00:23:42.04
Damn.

475
00:23:42.04 --> 00:23:43.48
So you were out there.

476
00:23:43.48 --> 00:23:44.48
Yeah.

477
00:23:44.48 --> 00:23:50.68
I remember I was working and my middle daughter, she did gymnastics and then she, that's like

478
00:23:50.68 --> 00:23:54.60
a little, there's a little, there's a little off ramp or a little on ramp to cheerleading.

479
00:23:54.60 --> 00:23:55.60
Right.

480
00:23:55.60 --> 00:23:57.24
And so she was doing gymnastics.

481
00:23:57.24 --> 00:24:01.52
Then she got on that little ramp and, you know, it's kind of like, dang it.

482
00:24:01.52 --> 00:24:06.64
You know, like it just doesn't seem like it's the thing that you want your daughter to do,

483
00:24:06.64 --> 00:24:08.64
at least for me, right.

484
00:24:08.64 --> 00:24:10.56
And then two things happened.

485
00:24:10.56 --> 00:24:15.96
One of them was this woman CEO that I worked with, who's an awesome woman.

486
00:24:15.96 --> 00:24:18.48
I told her, I was like, yeah, you know, my daughter's doing cheerleading.

487
00:24:18.48 --> 00:24:20.60
She's going to do cheerleading.

488
00:24:20.60 --> 00:24:23.20
And this woman's like, I did cheerleading and it was awesome.

489
00:24:23.20 --> 00:24:24.20
And I was like, really?

490
00:24:24.20 --> 00:24:25.20
She goes, yeah, you're out there.

491
00:24:25.20 --> 00:24:26.24
You're standing in front of people.

492
00:24:26.24 --> 00:24:27.24
You're projecting your voice.

493
00:24:27.24 --> 00:24:28.92
And I was like, okay, fair enough.

494
00:24:28.92 --> 00:24:31.80
And my daughter only did it for a couple of years.

495
00:24:31.80 --> 00:24:34.40
Then she's, then she got more committed to wrestling.

496
00:24:34.40 --> 00:24:35.40
Yes.

497
00:24:35.40 --> 00:24:39.36
Which was awesome.

498
00:24:39.36 --> 00:24:45.68
And another thing that happened was one of my buddies was also had a daughter who was

499
00:24:45.68 --> 00:24:49.08
also doing cheerleading.

500
00:24:49.08 --> 00:24:52.12
And he's like, he's kind of making fun of me.

501
00:24:52.12 --> 00:24:54.24
He goes, oh, you're letting your daughter do cheerleading.

502
00:24:54.24 --> 00:24:57.64
My daughter's doing cheerleading, but he's going to make fun of me because I guess I don't

503
00:24:57.64 --> 00:24:59.24
seem like the cheerleading type of dad.

504
00:24:59.24 --> 00:25:02.44
And he goes, oh, you're letting your daughter do cheerleading.

505
00:25:02.44 --> 00:25:06.40
And I go, yeah, you know, I figure I either let her do cheerleading or she comes home

506
00:25:06.40 --> 00:25:08.60
with a tattoo on her face when she's like 18.

507
00:25:08.60 --> 00:25:09.60
Right?

508
00:25:09.60 --> 00:25:10.60
Cause that's what happens.

509
00:25:10.60 --> 00:25:14.28
You like pressure your kids or you like steer them or you prevent them from doing something.

510
00:25:14.28 --> 00:25:16.88
They're going to rebel hard against you and then up on the wrong path.

511
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:19.20
So anyways, she did cheerleading for a little bit.

512
00:25:19.20 --> 00:25:20.20
All good.

513
00:25:20.20 --> 00:25:22.12
And did you do good in school?

514
00:25:22.12 --> 00:25:23.12
Oh yeah.

515
00:25:23.12 --> 00:25:26.24
I was pretty much a straight A student.

516
00:25:26.24 --> 00:25:28.36
Did you, what did you want to do when you grew up?

517
00:25:28.36 --> 00:25:29.56
Did you, did you want to go to college?

518
00:25:29.56 --> 00:25:30.92
Like what was the deal?

519
00:25:30.92 --> 00:25:34.44
So my parents were both raised in this really small town.

520
00:25:34.44 --> 00:25:39.000
They were in the same class together and had this sort of crush on each other since they

521
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.80
were in third grade all the way through, you know, junior high school, high school prom,

522
00:25:44.80 --> 00:25:48.44
king and queen, captain of the football team, captain of the cheerleading team.

523
00:25:48.44 --> 00:25:54.20
Like, you know, they, everything was my two, two sides of the family in this one little

524
00:25:54.20 --> 00:25:58.28
town, but my dad had these big aspirations to be a football coach.

525
00:25:58.28 --> 00:26:07.12
And so he actually got a full ride to University of Illinois and that's where he ended up going

526
00:26:07.12 --> 00:26:11.76
for his first coaching, you know, his first coaching gig.

527
00:26:11.76 --> 00:26:17.28
And from that point on, when he got out of that little town, he always said to me, you

528
00:26:17.28 --> 00:26:19.000
get out of here as soon as you can.

529
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Dang.

530
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.56
Cause he knew that, you know, there wasn't the opportunity for me there that I would

531
00:26:25.56 --> 00:26:29.32
need to have, you know, that he wanted me to have in life.

532
00:26:29.32 --> 00:26:35.000
I don't think he thought Marcus would be my ticket out of there, but, you know, he helped

533
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
facilitate that.

534
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
All right.

535
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So let's get to that.

536
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.40
So you ended up getting recruited to go play football.

537
00:26:40.40 --> 00:26:42.60
I did at Southern Illinois.

538
00:26:42.60 --> 00:26:45.92
And your dad was the head coach there?

539
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:46.92
Yeah.

540
00:26:46.92 --> 00:26:52.28
So at that point he'd been from U of I, he went to Miami of Ohio and then got the head

541
00:26:52.28 --> 00:26:56.36
football coaching job at Southern Illinois University and that was about 10 minutes from

542
00:26:56.36 --> 00:26:58.60
this little town that I grew up in.

543
00:26:58.60 --> 00:27:04.44
So he was 34 years old and he was the head coach of, you know, our hometown team.

544
00:27:04.44 --> 00:27:05.44
Yeah.

545
00:27:05.44 --> 00:27:06.44
Big school of 25,000 students.

546
00:27:06.44 --> 00:27:07.44
It was division one.

547
00:27:07.44 --> 00:27:08.44
Yeah.

548
00:27:08.44 --> 00:27:13.000
Now it's, it's, the enrollment's really gone down significantly, like a lot of schools,

549
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.64
but it was, it was, you know, it was a large school back then.

550
00:27:16.64 --> 00:27:18.84
And you roll in, you get recruited D one.

551
00:27:18.84 --> 00:27:19.84
Yeah.

552
00:27:19.84 --> 00:27:23.16
And so I got hurt in high school.

553
00:27:23.16 --> 00:27:25.04
So I wound up not playing my senior year.

554
00:27:25.04 --> 00:27:26.04
What was the injury?

555
00:27:26.04 --> 00:27:31.12
I tore a couple of ligaments in my wrist, my throwing wrist, tried to play through it

556
00:27:31.12 --> 00:27:34.60
for a couple of years and they never actually know whatever knew it was torn.

557
00:27:34.60 --> 00:27:40.04
I just kept having this, like I'd land on it wrong and, you know, have this like screaming

558
00:27:40.04 --> 00:27:41.04
pain.

559
00:27:41.04 --> 00:27:45.36
Finally got an MRI and they're like, yeah, you're, you have several torn ligaments.

560
00:27:45.36 --> 00:27:47.20
Like that's why you're in pain.

561
00:27:47.20 --> 00:27:51.40
So I said, we can do surgery now.

562
00:27:51.40 --> 00:27:55.24
You'll miss football season, but you'll be back for baseball season or you can play

563
00:27:55.24 --> 00:28:00.36
football season and then have surgery after, but you'd miss baseball season.

564
00:28:00.36 --> 00:28:08.80
And so just chatting with, you know, dad, I was excelling more in baseball and we decided,

565
00:28:08.80 --> 00:28:13.40
you know what, let's hang up football, have the surgery and we'll get you ready for baseball

566
00:28:13.40 --> 00:28:14.40
season.

567
00:28:14.40 --> 00:28:15.40
And you said what year was this?

568
00:28:15.40 --> 00:28:16.40
What was it?

569
00:28:16.40 --> 00:28:18.16
What school year was it?

570
00:28:18.16 --> 00:28:19.64
Like this was your junior year?

571
00:28:19.64 --> 00:28:22.76
This was my like summer.

572
00:28:22.76 --> 00:28:23.76
Yeah.

573
00:28:23.76 --> 00:28:25.12
Summer going into senior year.

574
00:28:25.12 --> 00:28:26.48
Got it.

575
00:28:26.48 --> 00:28:32.88
And so we decided to go ahead with the surgery and they went in and they did like an orthoscope

576
00:28:32.88 --> 00:28:36.48
and they found like the ligaments torn and then they just went ahead and sewed them back.

577
00:28:36.48 --> 00:28:39.48
And I remember it was a long recovery.

578
00:28:39.48 --> 00:28:43.000
It was like, it's almost six months.

579
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.84
And this is, this is so my dad.

580
00:28:44.84 --> 00:28:51.36
So I get done, get the surgery, go through, you know, however long I was in a cast, get

581
00:28:51.36 --> 00:28:56.48
the cast off, literally came home from getting the cast off after being in it for like four

582
00:28:56.48 --> 00:28:57.48
months.

583
00:28:57.48 --> 00:28:58.48
It was, it was long.

584
00:28:58.48 --> 00:28:59.92
It was weird.

585
00:28:59.92 --> 00:29:07.12
And he, he literally put to grab two minutes and pulled me onto the beach and he was like,

586
00:29:07.12 --> 00:29:08.12
throw the ball.

587
00:29:08.12 --> 00:29:10.64
I'm not, I'm not making this shit up.

588
00:29:10.64 --> 00:29:13.20
First off, like, can you imagine the size, like difference?

589
00:29:13.20 --> 00:29:15.48
It was like, my wrist is like this big.

590
00:29:15.48 --> 00:29:17.04
I haven't done anything.

591
00:29:17.04 --> 00:29:19.72
I pick up the ball and this is no shit.

592
00:29:19.72 --> 00:29:21.72
I throw it.

593
00:29:21.72 --> 00:29:23.36
Was it a baseball or football?

594
00:29:23.36 --> 00:29:24.36
It was a baseball.

595
00:29:24.36 --> 00:29:25.84
Cause I was trying to, I was trying to get ready for baseball.

596
00:29:25.84 --> 00:29:28.000
I literally threw it like a foot in front of me.

597
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.88
I didn't even know, and I didn't even know what to say.

598
00:29:29.88 --> 00:29:32.20
Like, dad, I can't, like I'm in a lot of pain.

599
00:29:32.20 --> 00:29:33.20
Did he get mad?

600
00:29:33.20 --> 00:29:34.20
He like, yeah.

601
00:29:34.20 --> 00:29:35.20
Oh my gosh.

602
00:29:35.20 --> 00:29:39.20
It was so fucking weird.

603
00:29:39.20 --> 00:29:43.48
Yeah, it got mad at me, like it was my fault that I couldn't throw this baseball after

604
00:29:43.48 --> 00:29:45.000
I just got out of it.

605
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.28
Anyway, so, so I played baseball.

606
00:29:47.28 --> 00:29:49.64
Um, didn't have a great season.

607
00:29:49.64 --> 00:30:00.12
Just played in, in, in, um, my younger football coach, Tom Frawley, I considered kind of like

608
00:30:00.12 --> 00:30:01.84
my second dad and quarterback coach.

609
00:30:01.84 --> 00:30:04.32
And he just said, Hey man, you're so talented.

610
00:30:04.32 --> 00:30:06.88
He's like, I think you should play football in junior college.

611
00:30:06.88 --> 00:30:10.84
Like you're, you know, I, you know, I think you have something you should do that.

612
00:30:10.84 --> 00:30:12.80
And I said, yeah, you know, I kind of threw it around.

613
00:30:12.80 --> 00:30:15.44
I went, okay, I'll, you know, I'll take your advice.

614
00:30:15.44 --> 00:30:19.72
And I started throwing him in the summer and I wound up enrolling in, uh, at NASA community

615
00:30:19.72 --> 00:30:24.08
college in New York and NASA every year had like top 10 football.

616
00:30:24.08 --> 00:30:29.32
Um, they always sent, uh, literally anywhere between 15 and 20 guys to division one and,

617
00:30:29.32 --> 00:30:32.96
and big division ones like Ohio State and Miami and things like that.

618
00:30:32.96 --> 00:30:35.20
And so I was going to a real place to play.

619
00:30:35.20 --> 00:30:40.28
And when I showed up, man, I was, uh, I was skinny.

620
00:30:40.28 --> 00:30:43.28
I was 17 going into my freshman year of college.

621
00:30:43.28 --> 00:30:44.72
Damn, you were young.

622
00:30:44.72 --> 00:30:49.36
Yeah, it was, yeah, it was, it was, bro, your dad for all this push and should have held

623
00:30:49.36 --> 00:30:51.72
your ass back like two years, dude.

624
00:30:51.72 --> 00:30:52.72
Two.

625
00:30:52.72 --> 00:30:53.72
You're right.

626
00:30:53.72 --> 00:30:55.24
You're so right.

627
00:30:55.24 --> 00:31:00.32
So I, you know, I show up again, six, four, 180.

628
00:31:00.32 --> 00:31:03.24
And, um, I mean, these, this is like a division one junior college.

629
00:31:03.24 --> 00:31:08.96
These guys are massive from like Brooklyn and the Bronx and these guys are like straight

630
00:31:08.96 --> 00:31:10.68
up meat eaters.

631
00:31:10.68 --> 00:31:14.12
And, um, I'm like, man, I don't even know if I belong here.

632
00:31:14.12 --> 00:31:17.56
So I hung in as a, as a freshman, you get red shirted.

633
00:31:17.56 --> 00:31:19.32
Um, I went to practice every day.

634
00:31:19.32 --> 00:31:26.40
I worked hard and I turned 18 that December of my freshman year and like in February,

635
00:31:26.40 --> 00:31:30.36
I went from six, four, 180 to like six, four, 225.

636
00:31:30.36 --> 00:31:31.36
Yeah.

637
00:31:31.36 --> 00:31:32.36
I was on the program.

638
00:31:32.36 --> 00:31:35.12
I was getting jacked, getting jacked.

639
00:31:35.12 --> 00:31:36.68
And, uh, yeah, it was good.

640
00:31:36.68 --> 00:31:40.44
I was actually, you know, I felt like a, felt like a human after that.

641
00:31:40.44 --> 00:31:47.08
Well, and I didn't know you then, but from what I gather, all that pent up frustration

642
00:31:47.08 --> 00:31:51.44
from the bullies of your childhood, you started taking it out with your increased size.

643
00:31:51.44 --> 00:31:52.44
Yeah.

644
00:31:52.44 --> 00:31:53.44
We've talked about this.

645
00:31:53.44 --> 00:31:54.44
So yeah.

646
00:31:54.44 --> 00:31:57.40
So, so with the increased weight and size, um, yes, Amber is correct.

647
00:31:57.40 --> 00:31:58.40
Um, I did.

648
00:31:58.40 --> 00:31:59.92
I started getting into a lot of fights, Jaco.

649
00:31:59.92 --> 00:32:00.92
Really?

650
00:32:00.92 --> 00:32:01.92
I look stupid, like dumb.

651
00:32:01.92 --> 00:32:04.44
I was like, all the time, a lot.

652
00:32:04.44 --> 00:32:07.08
And it was like, and this is when you're at this community college.

653
00:32:07.08 --> 00:32:08.08
Yeah.

654
00:32:08.08 --> 00:32:12.56
It just fed me, I think because of the years of maybe, you know, dad and then like being

655
00:32:12.56 --> 00:32:15.08
skinny, constantly getting harassed.

656
00:32:15.08 --> 00:32:20.64
Um, I finally put on some weight and, uh, I would just snap every time we went out.

657
00:32:20.64 --> 00:32:24.24
It didn't matter where any bar, um, I was getting in a fight.

658
00:32:24.24 --> 00:32:25.24
Yeah.

659
00:32:25.24 --> 00:32:26.24
Guaranteed.

660
00:32:26.24 --> 00:32:27.24
I was like, I was that guy.

661
00:32:27.24 --> 00:32:28.76
You drinking now at this age?

662
00:32:28.76 --> 00:32:29.76
Yes.

663
00:32:29.76 --> 00:32:30.76
Yep.

664
00:32:30.76 --> 00:32:33.000
That doesn't subdue fighting.

665
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.64
He doesn't help at all.

666
00:32:34.64 --> 00:32:35.64
He doesn't help.

667
00:32:35.64 --> 00:32:36.64
Um, yeah.

668
00:32:36.64 --> 00:32:40.12
I think growing up on Long Island, I actually remember the first time we drank because it

669
00:32:40.12 --> 00:32:43.28
was all my high school buddies freshman year, I believe it was Memorial Day.

670
00:32:43.28 --> 00:32:45.32
Like, Hey, Memorial Day, we're all going to get together.

671
00:32:45.32 --> 00:32:47.88
We're going to go get a couple cases.

672
00:32:47.88 --> 00:32:48.88
We're going to go down to the beach.

673
00:32:48.88 --> 00:32:50.20
We're going to drink some beer.

674
00:32:50.20 --> 00:32:54.84
And I remember saying, how can like, how can you put something in your body and it makes

675
00:32:54.84 --> 00:32:55.84
you act weird?

676
00:32:55.84 --> 00:32:56.92
Like I don't, I don't get it.

677
00:32:56.92 --> 00:32:58.64
Like I honestly did not get it.

678
00:32:58.64 --> 00:32:59.84
And we were having this argument.

679
00:32:59.84 --> 00:33:00.84
Like, I don't get it.

680
00:33:00.84 --> 00:33:01.84
Like I could drink 10 of these.

681
00:33:01.84 --> 00:33:03.84
Like I'm going to be fine.

682
00:33:03.84 --> 00:33:08.68
Um, and I think I remember at some point of that night, like humping the pole.

683
00:33:08.68 --> 00:33:09.84
Um, literally.

684
00:33:09.84 --> 00:33:14.12
And so, uh, yeah, don't, don't drink.

685
00:33:14.12 --> 00:33:18.44
So you're like 12 or 13 or something.

686
00:33:18.44 --> 00:33:19.44
Literally 13.

687
00:33:19.44 --> 00:33:20.44
I think it was 14 at that.

688
00:33:20.44 --> 00:33:21.44
Yeah.

689
00:33:21.44 --> 00:33:22.68
Because it was the second part of my freshman year.

690
00:33:22.68 --> 00:33:26.04
So did you keep drinking through this?

691
00:33:26.04 --> 00:33:27.56
Was it a thing or not really?

692
00:33:27.56 --> 00:33:28.56
Yeah.

693
00:33:28.56 --> 00:33:29.56
Yeah.

694
00:33:29.56 --> 00:33:32.52
I drank, um, I drank on the weekends when we went out.

695
00:33:32.52 --> 00:33:36.44
So never during the week, Amber still makes fun of me that I was in bed.

696
00:33:36.44 --> 00:33:42.20
He had a bedtime, 9pm until he left the house.

697
00:33:42.20 --> 00:33:46.20
Through senior year of high school, like not even during senior year.

698
00:33:46.20 --> 00:33:48.52
Was this a mandated by the old man?

699
00:33:48.52 --> 00:33:49.84
This is mandated by mom.

700
00:33:49.84 --> 00:33:50.84
Okay.

701
00:33:50.84 --> 00:33:53.40
Like, but at that point though, I didn't think for myself at all.

702
00:33:53.40 --> 00:33:55.24
I was just like, Oh, it's 830.

703
00:33:55.24 --> 00:33:57.40
I need to get ready and go to bed.

704
00:33:57.40 --> 00:34:01.20
You know, the light was on and my mom screaming down like, Mark is shut the light off, go

705
00:34:01.20 --> 00:34:02.20
to bed.

706
00:34:02.20 --> 00:34:05.000
You got to get up in the morning and catch the train.

707
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.28
You know, um, meanwhile Amber's out at my house in college till like three in the morning.

708
00:34:10.28 --> 00:34:12.64
But we'll talk, we'll get into that after.

709
00:34:12.64 --> 00:34:14.04
Um, yeah.

710
00:34:14.04 --> 00:34:16.52
So, uh, where were we at?

711
00:34:16.52 --> 00:34:18.20
Are you, are you thinking through high school?

712
00:34:18.20 --> 00:34:20.12
Are you thinking about the military at all?

713
00:34:20.12 --> 00:34:21.12
No, not at all.

714
00:34:21.12 --> 00:34:23.16
I mean, I didn't, I didn't think much, Jacko.

715
00:34:23.16 --> 00:34:25.96
I'm just starting to come into thinking the last couple of years.

716
00:34:25.96 --> 00:34:28.16
And you're just solely focused on athletics.

717
00:34:28.16 --> 00:34:29.16
That's it.

718
00:34:29.16 --> 00:34:30.16
That's what you're going to do.

719
00:34:30.16 --> 00:34:35.44
Um, but, uh, yeah, I didn't think the only thing, the only connection I had to the military,

720
00:34:35.44 --> 00:34:37.72
my grandfather had a purple heart.

721
00:34:37.72 --> 00:34:39.16
It was in the house.

722
00:34:39.16 --> 00:34:43.16
I didn't know this between a purple heart and a purple rose.

723
00:34:43.16 --> 00:34:49.12
And, um, he mentioned it was from a mortar attack fighting the, uh, I think fighting

724
00:34:49.12 --> 00:34:51.56
in Northern Africa against the Italians.

725
00:34:51.56 --> 00:34:58.40
Um, and, but he was another guy who evidently gotten a lot of fights because I guess the

726
00:34:58.40 --> 00:35:02.64
military was a lot different from World War II or they would pull like your rank away.

727
00:35:02.64 --> 00:35:06.52
Like when you weren't on the battlefield, you know, if you got in trouble like he did.

728
00:35:06.52 --> 00:35:10.64
And then when he came back, I don't know, some weird story that I listened to, it was probably

729
00:35:10.64 --> 00:35:13.40
completely wrong coming from my dad.

730
00:35:13.40 --> 00:35:15.64
Um, so that's the only like real.

731
00:35:15.64 --> 00:35:17.16
Well, and your dad was in the army.

732
00:35:17.16 --> 00:35:23.80
Well, he was by, I think on, uh, I don't know if he got, where your dad, the hippie was,

733
00:35:23.80 --> 00:35:25.16
your dad, the hippie was in the army.

734
00:35:25.16 --> 00:35:26.16
Yeah.

735
00:35:26.16 --> 00:35:27.16
He was an MP.

736
00:35:27.16 --> 00:35:28.16
He's a dog handler.

737
00:35:28.16 --> 00:35:32.64
That's all I heard about growing up is his ferocious dog that bit everybody.

738
00:35:32.64 --> 00:35:35.04
So I'm like, so you're a shitty dog.

739
00:35:35.04 --> 00:35:38.44
Cause we had a few of those guys too, right?

740
00:35:38.44 --> 00:35:42.40
Like, did he give you any impression of like, Hey, you know, the military's dumb or you

741
00:35:42.40 --> 00:35:44.24
shouldn't join it or whatever, anything like that?

742
00:35:44.24 --> 00:35:45.24
Absolutely.

743
00:35:45.24 --> 00:35:46.24
Yeah.

744
00:35:46.24 --> 00:35:48.96
And I don't think he ever talked about it negatively.

745
00:35:48.96 --> 00:35:49.96
Just, just, just wasn't there.

746
00:35:49.96 --> 00:35:50.96
Yeah.

747
00:35:50.96 --> 00:35:51.96
It just wasn't there.

748
00:35:51.96 --> 00:35:52.96
Got it.

749
00:35:52.96 --> 00:35:56.08
And I wasn't with a crew of like, um, you know, first responder families, like police

750
00:35:56.08 --> 00:35:57.08
and fire.

751
00:35:57.08 --> 00:36:02.12
So I just didn't have that, you know, it was more like artists and, and, uh, but nothing

752
00:36:02.12 --> 00:36:08.68
negative, nothing ever negative, but really no, um, I was never, uh, it just wasn't a

753
00:36:08.68 --> 00:36:09.68
part of my life.

754
00:36:09.68 --> 00:36:10.68
I was raised a patriot.

755
00:36:10.68 --> 00:36:11.68
Yeah.

756
00:36:11.68 --> 00:36:12.68
Marcus was not.

757
00:36:12.68 --> 00:36:13.68
Yeah.

758
00:36:13.68 --> 00:36:16.08
So I was the one who, I was the one who got the better that I framed that I wrote in third

759
00:36:16.08 --> 00:36:18.36
grade on veterans day.

760
00:36:18.36 --> 00:36:23.48
And it was, it's so funny to read it back, but even as a nine year old, I'm like, yeah,

761
00:36:23.48 --> 00:36:24.48
that's who I am.

762
00:36:24.48 --> 00:36:27.48
Were your parents military or was your dad military or granddad or anything?

763
00:36:27.48 --> 00:36:33.44
No, my great grandmother had five brothers in World War II and two or three of them were

764
00:36:33.44 --> 00:36:34.44
killed.

765
00:36:34.44 --> 00:36:35.92
One of them was a POW.

766
00:36:35.92 --> 00:36:44.12
And so, you know, I just, it was just instilled in me that we love America and we honor our

767
00:36:44.12 --> 00:36:45.24
military.

768
00:36:45.24 --> 00:36:50.28
Um, but I didn't ever think I wanted to be married to someone in the military.

769
00:36:50.28 --> 00:36:51.52
That's a whole different ball game.

770
00:36:51.52 --> 00:36:52.52
Right.

771
00:36:52.52 --> 00:36:59.20
I was also, you know, my hometown was so small and, um, it wasn't, you know, a very, uh, there

772
00:36:59.20 --> 00:37:01.60
wasn't a lot of money in the area that I grew up.

773
00:37:01.60 --> 00:37:05.44
And so people that joined the military in my hometown couldn't afford college.

774
00:37:05.44 --> 00:37:07.04
It was just a way to pay for college.

775
00:37:07.04 --> 00:37:11.88
So like I had this great appreciation, but I also, I was completely dumb to like what

776
00:37:11.88 --> 00:37:13.88
the military service actually was.

777
00:37:13.88 --> 00:37:14.88
All right.

778
00:37:14.88 --> 00:37:15.88
So let's get into this.

779
00:37:15.88 --> 00:37:19.84
How the coach's daughter, I mean, how does this go about?

780
00:37:19.84 --> 00:37:24.12
This can't be, you were thinking much, right?

781
00:37:24.12 --> 00:37:26.32
Marcus, I mean, this is the good.

782
00:37:26.32 --> 00:37:27.32
This is like taboo.

783
00:37:27.32 --> 00:37:29.76
Is there anything more taboo than, oh, that's the coach's daughter.

784
00:37:29.76 --> 00:37:30.76
Cool.

785
00:37:30.76 --> 00:37:31.76
Yeah.

786
00:37:31.76 --> 00:37:32.76
That's where I'm going to go.

787
00:37:32.76 --> 00:37:33.76
Yeah.

788
00:37:33.76 --> 00:37:34.76
That's exactly it.

789
00:37:34.76 --> 00:37:41.24
I went to Southern Illinois, um, in, I don't know, was it 96 Amber?

790
00:37:41.24 --> 00:37:42.24
Yeah.

791
00:37:42.24 --> 00:37:49.88
And, uh, I'm just trying to think how I get into, how, how are you and I, so okay.

792
00:37:49.88 --> 00:37:54.64
When I was first looking at the, um, like the media guide for the football teams before

793
00:37:54.64 --> 00:37:57.08
I even went to Southern Illinois, I was still in New York.

794
00:37:57.08 --> 00:38:01.72
Um, I saw that coach Watson had had, you know, obviously had a family in there and had a

795
00:38:01.72 --> 00:38:02.72
daughter.

796
00:38:02.72 --> 00:38:06.40
Again, never even, I was like, Oh wow, that's interesting.

797
00:38:06.40 --> 00:38:09.56
You know, that, that's, came across my mind.

798
00:38:09.56 --> 00:38:10.92
Um, but that was it.

799
00:38:10.92 --> 00:38:14.44
Like let's put that away now for like two more years.

800
00:38:14.44 --> 00:38:23.80
And I show up at school and I think about a year and a half in is I met you at Cuckoo's.

801
00:38:23.80 --> 00:38:27.40
No, at a golf tournament, but I didn't even see you there.

802
00:38:27.40 --> 00:38:28.40
You didn't see me.

803
00:38:28.40 --> 00:38:29.40
I saw you at the golf tournament.

804
00:38:29.40 --> 00:38:30.40
Yeah.

805
00:38:30.40 --> 00:38:32.40
You looked really angry and pissed off that you were there.

806
00:38:32.40 --> 00:38:33.40
Yeah.

807
00:38:33.40 --> 00:38:38.88
Well, so we had, we did a, um, I guess, uh, a volunteer for the, some golf tournament

808
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:43.20
and I remember seeing Amber there like at the table and she was angry and I remember a guy

809
00:38:43.20 --> 00:38:45.16
saying like that's coach Watson's daughter.

810
00:38:45.16 --> 00:38:48.76
You know, everyone was like, okay, stay away from, are you just trying to keep people at

811
00:38:48.76 --> 00:38:51.84
bay just scowling at everyone or what was up with that?

812
00:38:51.84 --> 00:38:52.84
I don't know.

813
00:38:52.84 --> 00:38:56.28
I think I was probably, I don't know.

814
00:38:56.28 --> 00:39:01.28
I think I was probably traumatized by having to be there.

815
00:39:01.28 --> 00:39:04.84
Um, so, so that's the first time.

816
00:39:04.84 --> 00:39:09.48
Are you, are Marcus at this point, are you like a full on like just straight beard, swill

817
00:39:09.48 --> 00:39:10.48
and jock?

818
00:39:10.48 --> 00:39:11.48
Yes.

819
00:39:11.48 --> 00:39:12.48
What are we dealing with?

820
00:39:12.48 --> 00:39:13.48
100%.

821
00:39:13.48 --> 00:39:14.48
But a nice, but I was a nice job.

822
00:39:14.48 --> 00:39:16.28
I don't know if that makes any sense.

823
00:39:16.28 --> 00:39:17.28
But you're fighting a lot.

824
00:39:17.28 --> 00:39:18.28
I'm fighting a lot.

825
00:39:18.28 --> 00:39:20.28
Still fighting a lot when you get to college.

826
00:39:20.28 --> 00:39:21.28
Oh yeah.

827
00:39:21.28 --> 00:39:22.28
Oh gosh.

828
00:39:22.28 --> 00:39:23.28
Yeah.

829
00:39:23.28 --> 00:39:29.08
Um, I mean, we'll go into, I mean, I was suspended from Amber's dad my whole sophomore year after

830
00:39:29.08 --> 00:39:35.08
I just got named the starting quarterback over four seniors.

831
00:39:35.08 --> 00:39:41.36
So your dad was great in recruiting me, but not in the choice of personality.

832
00:39:41.36 --> 00:39:45.08
So that night I go out, go to fraternity party.

833
00:39:45.08 --> 00:39:47.92
This is the night you get named as a starting quarterback.

834
00:39:47.92 --> 00:39:50.28
So you're freaking stoked.

835
00:39:50.28 --> 00:39:55.80
And I'd been hearing about him and you know, like the whole area had been hearing about

836
00:39:55.80 --> 00:40:00.76
him because you get like this big good looking guy from New York and it's who's named Marcus

837
00:40:00.76 --> 00:40:02.12
Capone.

838
00:40:02.12 --> 00:40:05.20
And so I'm like hearing this buzz.

839
00:40:05.20 --> 00:40:07.88
But did you meet him yet when he gets named as a starting quarterback?

840
00:40:07.88 --> 00:40:08.88
No, no.

841
00:40:08.88 --> 00:40:12.40
And apparently we'd been at that golf tournament, but I didn't know who he was.

842
00:40:12.40 --> 00:40:13.40
And got it.

843
00:40:13.40 --> 00:40:14.40
So, all right.

844
00:40:14.40 --> 00:40:15.76
So now you get named.

845
00:40:15.76 --> 00:40:20.36
So we go out myself, the fullback who was my roommate who's just a stud, you know, like

846
00:40:20.36 --> 00:40:24.64
600, 400 pound guy, like a squat bench, you know, that type of dude and can run like a

847
00:40:24.64 --> 00:40:26.80
four, five, 40.

848
00:40:26.80 --> 00:40:32.04
And we go to this fraternity party, which is really off limits.

849
00:40:32.04 --> 00:40:35.58
Football athletes and fraternities really didn't mix.

850
00:40:35.58 --> 00:40:36.58
Most of the fraternities.

851
00:40:36.58 --> 00:40:38.72
Like officially, like you're not allowed to go to them or just?

852
00:40:38.72 --> 00:40:43.88
No, it's more, you just don't because a lot of those guys were high school athletes that

853
00:40:43.88 --> 00:40:45.32
couldn't play in college.

854
00:40:45.32 --> 00:40:48.80
And so there was a little bit of like, you know, bad blood.

855
00:40:48.80 --> 00:40:53.28
We went because a lot of the female trainers that you go and get your, you know, put your

856
00:40:53.28 --> 00:40:58.80
eyes and, you know, your elbow and eyes or get hooked up to stem or whatever.

857
00:40:58.80 --> 00:41:00.20
They were all sorority.

858
00:41:00.20 --> 00:41:01.20
So they invited us.

859
00:41:01.20 --> 00:41:02.88
So three of us went.

860
00:41:02.88 --> 00:41:06.44
And right from this get go, you can tell, like just it's in the air.

861
00:41:06.44 --> 00:41:09.04
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

862
00:41:09.04 --> 00:41:14.40
You could feel the energy in there was just not going our direction.

863
00:41:14.40 --> 00:41:15.88
And one thing led to another.

864
00:41:15.88 --> 00:41:20.56
And the next thing you know, there's literally a whole fraternity house on top of us in the

865
00:41:20.56 --> 00:41:21.56
middle of the yard.

866
00:41:21.56 --> 00:41:23.72
There were so many of them.

867
00:41:23.72 --> 00:41:24.72
I think it was lucky.

868
00:41:24.72 --> 00:41:27.64
I think it was what saved us because there were so many that they couldn't like get to

869
00:41:27.64 --> 00:41:29.64
us and like punch and kick and everything else.

870
00:41:29.64 --> 00:41:33.48
But I do remember like being on the ground and going, man, they can't even get to us.

871
00:41:33.48 --> 00:41:35.08
There's so many of them.

872
00:41:35.08 --> 00:41:36.20
I remember this hand.

873
00:41:36.20 --> 00:41:42.24
I could feel this hand like coming up like my arm and then my shoulder and then my neck.

874
00:41:42.24 --> 00:41:46.36
And then I feel like it's in my face and then like just start like, like, like raking me

875
00:41:46.36 --> 00:41:47.36
like raking my high.

876
00:41:47.36 --> 00:41:51.36
I'm like, this guy's trying to pull my and I couldn't do anything about it.

877
00:41:51.36 --> 00:41:53.76
So for somehow, this is the best.

878
00:41:53.76 --> 00:41:59.52
So somehow the fullback, my roommate crawls out underneath all of them and charges the

879
00:41:59.52 --> 00:42:05.48
wooden fence and both literally hits it and knocks the whole fence down the yard.

880
00:42:05.48 --> 00:42:12.16
So you can tell how well these fences were made in a college, you know, collegiate house,

881
00:42:12.16 --> 00:42:13.48
pieces of crap.

882
00:42:13.48 --> 00:42:16.28
So the fence goes down, which enables us to get out.

883
00:42:16.28 --> 00:42:17.84
Fix now we're out of the yard.

884
00:42:17.84 --> 00:42:23.36
So I'm standing in the street like my eye is completely red like they now they like it's

885
00:42:23.36 --> 00:42:26.44
it's it's good and scratched.

886
00:42:26.44 --> 00:42:28.06
I'm missing a sandal.

887
00:42:28.06 --> 00:42:31.04
My shirts rift.

888
00:42:31.04 --> 00:42:37.48
You know, I'm standing in the street cursing and we cool down a little bit and we go walking

889
00:42:37.48 --> 00:42:43.96
back to the the dorms, go to bed because that was a fun night getting getting jumped

890
00:42:43.96 --> 00:42:46.92
by a fraternity house, the pikes.

891
00:42:46.92 --> 00:42:48.92
I shouldn't even gave him that.

892
00:42:48.92 --> 00:42:50.92
Gave him that shout out.

893
00:42:50.92 --> 00:42:55.92
You guys are just jealous.

894
00:42:55.92 --> 00:42:59.84
And we we come across the street.

895
00:42:59.84 --> 00:43:07.20
We crossed the strip where all the bars and clubs are at and out on the street.

896
00:43:07.20 --> 00:43:13.72
This club is emptying and it's the all the guys in the football team are coming out and

897
00:43:13.72 --> 00:43:18.16
they're like Marcus what's going on with what what the fuck happened to you.

898
00:43:18.16 --> 00:43:23.72
I'm like, oh man, you know, the the the pikes they jumped us and these guys are everyone's

899
00:43:23.72 --> 00:43:26.04
drunk and that was it.

900
00:43:26.04 --> 00:43:30.68
So they decided they're going to go back to the fraternity house.

901
00:43:30.68 --> 00:43:34.16
So like 30 dudes go back to the fraternity house.

902
00:43:34.16 --> 00:43:36.32
I follow behind them.

903
00:43:36.32 --> 00:43:40.24
And when I get there, it's complete mayhem.

904
00:43:40.24 --> 00:43:42.32
There's people getting bricks busted over their face.

905
00:43:42.32 --> 00:43:51.20
I watched a person in the NFL pick up a grill and throw it on somebody.

906
00:43:51.20 --> 00:43:53.56
So it was it was that type of shit going on.

907
00:43:53.56 --> 00:43:56.24
And I was like, wow.

908
00:43:56.24 --> 00:44:03.44
So police you could hear police sirens coming and like everybody splits and you know, kind

909
00:44:03.44 --> 00:44:04.52
of the rest is history.

910
00:44:04.52 --> 00:44:09.52
I get brought in because I was the only white guy at the at the fight.

911
00:44:09.52 --> 00:44:12.76
They couldn't identify anybody there.

912
00:44:12.76 --> 00:44:16.04
And they wanted me to give up all the names of the guys over there.

913
00:44:16.04 --> 00:44:18.000
And I was like, no chance.

914
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.80
I don't even know who's there actually.

915
00:44:19.80 --> 00:44:25.92
So because I would not give up any names, your dad Amber suspended me for the whole

916
00:44:25.92 --> 00:44:28.16
season.

917
00:44:28.16 --> 00:44:30.000
Because they couldn't identify anybody.

918
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.20
And so I wind up being suspended for pretty much that was and that was it.

919
00:44:34.20 --> 00:44:37.44
Kind of crushed your dad's a hard ass.

920
00:44:37.44 --> 00:44:39.60
I think it was pressured.

921
00:44:39.60 --> 00:44:42.48
No, my dad is very principled.

922
00:44:42.48 --> 00:44:48.60
And on the same hand, my dad, you know, was trying to turn this program around and his

923
00:44:48.60 --> 00:44:51.64
entire team would have been out.

924
00:44:51.64 --> 00:44:55.68
So Marcus took the punishment for the whole team.

925
00:44:55.68 --> 00:44:58.12
And I know he felt bad about that.

926
00:44:58.12 --> 00:45:02.36
But I also know that he respected Marcus not giving up anyone's names.

927
00:45:02.36 --> 00:45:06.92
And it coincidentally saved his ass too, I'm sure.

928
00:45:06.92 --> 00:45:12.80
But I remember that fight because I had worked really hard all summer to save money for a

929
00:45:12.80 --> 00:45:15.48
car and we were going to go buy the car.

930
00:45:15.48 --> 00:45:18.64
And I had, I had picked the car out.

931
00:45:18.64 --> 00:45:20.24
We were supposed to go in Saturday.

932
00:45:20.24 --> 00:45:22.84
We being you and your dad?

933
00:45:22.84 --> 00:45:23.84
No really just me.

934
00:45:23.84 --> 00:45:24.84
Oh, OK.

935
00:45:24.84 --> 00:45:29.28
Just to go back, like it wasn't it was a local fight, but evidently some of the guys

936
00:45:29.28 --> 00:45:33.32
of the fraternity houses, dads were in kind of higher positions in Chicago.

937
00:45:33.32 --> 00:45:37.16
It made national news because eight guys got sent to the hospital.

938
00:45:37.16 --> 00:45:39.44
So yeah, it was like a it's not good.

939
00:45:39.44 --> 00:45:40.68
That's a legit scrap.

940
00:45:40.68 --> 00:45:43.08
And I had a few drinks, as you can imagine.

941
00:45:43.08 --> 00:45:45.88
It was legit scrap for sure.

942
00:45:45.88 --> 00:45:47.24
So I had picked out this car.

943
00:45:47.24 --> 00:45:48.72
I'd been working so hard for it.

944
00:45:48.72 --> 00:45:53.40
My dad had been so busy and we were going to go on Saturday morning at 10 a.m. something

945
00:45:53.40 --> 00:45:56.000
and I call my dad and I'm like, dad, are you ready?

946
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.36
And he goes like, no honey, my quarterback caused the biggest fight last night.

947
00:46:01.36 --> 00:46:03.92
You have no idea the shit storm I'm dealing with.

948
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:05.60
And so I'm like, screw your quarterback.

949
00:46:05.60 --> 00:46:06.60
I hate him.

950
00:46:06.60 --> 00:46:07.60
I don't even know him.

951
00:46:07.60 --> 00:46:10.60
He's all I wanted was I've waited so long to get this car.

952
00:46:10.60 --> 00:46:14.12
So anyway, that was also the beginning of my independence of being like, you know what?

953
00:46:14.12 --> 00:46:15.84
I'll go negotiate this deal.

954
00:46:15.84 --> 00:46:17.48
And that's exactly what I did.

955
00:46:17.48 --> 00:46:23.24
So that was sort of how I came to know like who Marcus even was because it was all over

956
00:46:23.24 --> 00:46:24.24
the news.

957
00:46:24.24 --> 00:46:30.60
And then I saw his picture in the paper and I was immediately like, oh, damn.

958
00:46:30.60 --> 00:46:31.96
This is the guy.

959
00:46:31.96 --> 00:46:33.64
He's so hot.

960
00:46:33.64 --> 00:46:38.04
And like fast forward, probably a year.

961
00:46:38.04 --> 00:46:44.56
My best friend had drank too much at a bowling alley slash nightclub and I had to go pick

962
00:46:44.56 --> 00:46:46.64
her up and I was not happy about that either.

963
00:46:46.64 --> 00:46:53.76
And so when I walked in, I went to the back door and the bouncer opened the door so I

964
00:46:53.76 --> 00:46:58.40
could get in together and Marcus was like, from me to him right now.

965
00:46:58.40 --> 00:47:03.24
He's right there and I was like immediately taken so aback.

966
00:47:03.24 --> 00:47:06.48
And I just said, oh, you're the troublemaker.

967
00:47:06.48 --> 00:47:09.28
And we sparked this conversation.

968
00:47:09.28 --> 00:47:13.56
I, oh, I was so smitten, but I didn't, I don't think I let on like I was.

969
00:47:13.56 --> 00:47:16.64
And I saw you there every week for like four weeks.

970
00:47:16.64 --> 00:47:21.60
I went back every week and then he wasn't there one week.

971
00:47:21.60 --> 00:47:26.52
And his friend who is the bouncer there took my number and gave it to Marcus and he called

972
00:47:26.52 --> 00:47:34.56
me that night and we hung out for the first time on July 4th of 1997 and we've been thick

973
00:47:34.56 --> 00:47:37.06
since.

974
00:47:37.06 --> 00:47:39.56
The end.

975
00:47:39.56 --> 00:47:41.32
So suspended.

976
00:47:41.32 --> 00:47:42.32
Was that your sophomore year?

977
00:47:42.32 --> 00:47:43.32
That's my sophomore year.

978
00:47:43.32 --> 00:47:44.32
You get suspended.

979
00:47:44.32 --> 00:47:45.32
Yeah.

980
00:47:45.32 --> 00:47:46.32
Are you allowed to practice?

981
00:47:46.32 --> 00:47:47.32
Like what are you doing?

982
00:47:47.32 --> 00:47:48.32
Yes.

983
00:47:48.32 --> 00:47:49.32
So I had, yeah, I just work in your ass off.

984
00:47:49.32 --> 00:47:50.32
Yeah, I work my ass off.

985
00:47:50.32 --> 00:47:52.84
I practiced every day.

986
00:47:52.84 --> 00:47:57.24
I went into treatment room, you know, three days, three times a day, still went to study

987
00:47:57.24 --> 00:47:59.12
hall, which we had to do every evening.

988
00:47:59.12 --> 00:48:00.32
And then I broke down every film.

989
00:48:00.32 --> 00:48:07.48
So I'd have to watch hours and hours of every play from every angle of every upcoming game.

990
00:48:07.48 --> 00:48:12.36
And then I would write, you know, take notes and like all defensive, um, coverages.

991
00:48:12.36 --> 00:48:17.48
And so like I learned, you know, I learned, um, but it was miserable because I couldn't

992
00:48:17.48 --> 00:48:18.48
play on.

993
00:48:18.48 --> 00:48:19.48
What did you think of my dad?

994
00:48:19.48 --> 00:48:20.48
I don't think I've ever asked you this.

995
00:48:20.48 --> 00:48:23.80
What was your relationship with my dad like?

996
00:48:23.80 --> 00:48:24.80
It was, it was good.

997
00:48:24.80 --> 00:48:26.32
No, we, I mean, we always had a good relationship.

998
00:48:26.32 --> 00:48:29.80
I mean, I was angry because I didn't get to, you know, I didn't get to play.

999
00:48:29.80 --> 00:48:30.80
Like,

1000
00:48:30.80 --> 00:48:31.80
How did he treat you then?

1001
00:48:31.80 --> 00:48:32.80
He treated me well.

1002
00:48:32.80 --> 00:48:33.80
Yeah.

1003
00:48:33.80 --> 00:48:35.44
I mean, I was cut up film from every day.

1004
00:48:35.44 --> 00:48:38.28
It seems like like, like there's a little bit of mutual respect.

1005
00:48:38.28 --> 00:48:41.64
Like he respect, kind of respect the fact that you didn't rat anybody out.

1006
00:48:41.64 --> 00:48:42.96
He actually said, they said that too.

1007
00:48:42.96 --> 00:48:46.44
They all said that because they were like, kind of saved the season because if you, if

1008
00:48:46.44 --> 00:48:50.72
any of those, you know, they were all, they were all, you know, they're all the stars,

1009
00:48:50.72 --> 00:48:51.72
right?

1010
00:48:51.72 --> 00:48:53.52
So, um, and these were good guys.

1011
00:48:53.52 --> 00:48:56.32
Um, so they weren't, yeah, they weren't angry.

1012
00:48:56.32 --> 00:48:58.44
They were just like, you're an idiot.

1013
00:48:58.44 --> 00:49:01.12
You got, one, you got caught too.

1014
00:49:01.12 --> 00:49:02.96
What are you doing at the pike house?

1015
00:49:02.96 --> 00:49:04.44
You know, that's right.

1016
00:49:04.44 --> 00:49:09.56
So there was one time when we were dating, but we hadn't been dating for too long that

1017
00:49:09.56 --> 00:49:13.86
Marcus came home from practice and said, your dad knows.

1018
00:49:13.86 --> 00:49:16.12
And I was like, Oh, what do you mean?

1019
00:49:16.12 --> 00:49:17.12
My dad knows.

1020
00:49:17.12 --> 00:49:18.12
Yeah.

1021
00:49:18.12 --> 00:49:19.68
That's after he left and went to Northwest.

1022
00:49:19.68 --> 00:49:20.68
Yeah.

1023
00:49:20.68 --> 00:49:22.96
So we were never dating when my dad was there.

1024
00:49:22.96 --> 00:49:23.96
Got it.

1025
00:49:23.96 --> 00:49:27.40
That year that Marcus was breaking down film and whatnot.

1026
00:49:27.40 --> 00:49:30.76
At the end of that year, my dad took a job at Northwestern.

1027
00:49:30.76 --> 00:49:36.88
And so a new coach had come in and I met you when, when coach Q had taken over the team.

1028
00:49:36.88 --> 00:49:37.88
Yeah.

1029
00:49:37.88 --> 00:49:38.88
And your dad already left.

1030
00:49:38.88 --> 00:49:42.16
So, but he did find out and he called and he was not happy with her.

1031
00:49:42.16 --> 00:49:43.16
Yeah.

1032
00:49:43.16 --> 00:49:44.16
I was 17.

1033
00:49:44.16 --> 00:49:45.16
Oh, she's the high school.

1034
00:49:45.16 --> 00:49:46.80
She's in my senior year of high school.

1035
00:49:46.80 --> 00:49:47.80
Oh, damn.

1036
00:49:47.80 --> 00:49:49.32
And how old are you at this point?

1037
00:49:49.32 --> 00:49:50.32
20.

1038
00:49:50.32 --> 00:49:51.32
Oh yeah.

1039
00:49:51.32 --> 00:49:52.32
That's not a happy dad.

1040
00:49:52.32 --> 00:49:53.32
I got three daughters, man.

1041
00:49:53.32 --> 00:49:54.32
Yeah.

1042
00:49:54.32 --> 00:49:55.32
You wouldn't be happy.

1043
00:49:55.32 --> 00:49:57.76
I have a sophomore, San Diego State.

1044
00:49:57.76 --> 00:49:58.76
I get it.

1045
00:49:58.76 --> 00:49:59.76
Yeah.

1046
00:49:59.76 --> 00:50:05.12
She has pepper spray and taser on that all the time.

1047
00:50:05.12 --> 00:50:13.84
I had to call him because I didn't, you know, I respect my dad a lot and I wanted to call

1048
00:50:13.84 --> 00:50:16.64
him and sort of like head this off.

1049
00:50:16.64 --> 00:50:21.84
And one of Marcus's coaches who was still friends with him said like, hey, coach Watson

1050
00:50:21.84 --> 00:50:24.88
knows that you're dating his daughter.

1051
00:50:24.88 --> 00:50:32.24
So I called him and he was like, well, honey, I'm going to tell you this.

1052
00:50:32.24 --> 00:50:36.08
He said, Marcus is one of the few players that I can say that I truly love.

1053
00:50:36.08 --> 00:50:37.64
Like I love that kid.

1054
00:50:37.64 --> 00:50:42.60
He's like, but he's a womanizer and he will break your heart.

1055
00:50:42.60 --> 00:50:45.68
And if he breaks your heart, you tell him, I will break his neck.

1056
00:50:45.68 --> 00:50:47.000
Oh, there you go.

1057
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Right on.

1058
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.16
Pops coming in hot.

1059
00:50:50.16 --> 00:50:52.60
He had a, yeah, he had a, he had a temper.

1060
00:50:52.60 --> 00:50:53.60
Yeah.

1061
00:50:53.60 --> 00:50:54.60
He had a real temper on the field.

1062
00:50:54.60 --> 00:50:55.60
He had a temper.

1063
00:50:55.60 --> 00:50:58.60
No, he actually had a temper everywhere.

1064
00:50:58.60 --> 00:51:01.48
He's an amazing human being.

1065
00:51:01.48 --> 00:51:06.04
So, so your dad leaves from coaching that job the next year.

1066
00:51:06.04 --> 00:51:07.76
Now it's your junior year in college.

1067
00:51:07.76 --> 00:51:08.92
Are you starting as a quarterback?

1068
00:51:08.92 --> 00:51:09.92
No.

1069
00:51:09.92 --> 00:51:14.56
I'm a really good quarterback from Missouri who actually split time at University of Missouri

1070
00:51:14.56 --> 00:51:17.56
with one of the guys who was up for the Heisman.

1071
00:51:17.56 --> 00:51:21.56
So you know, really after the fight, I feel like everything just went downhill after that.

1072
00:51:21.56 --> 00:51:23.28
So we still on the team.

1073
00:51:23.28 --> 00:51:24.36
I was still on the team.

1074
00:51:24.36 --> 00:51:26.48
I was still under, you know, still in scholarship.

1075
00:51:26.48 --> 00:51:33.64
So I, this, this guy came in and, you know, we're actually really close to, to this date.

1076
00:51:33.64 --> 00:51:37.72
Kent Scornia, he's very successful in, in Missouri and St. Louis.

1077
00:51:37.72 --> 00:51:42.88
And actually he's a donor to Vets and he was always my roommate on the road.

1078
00:51:42.88 --> 00:51:47.28
But he, yeah, he came in, he was like a true quarterback from the Midwest.

1079
00:51:47.28 --> 00:51:49.12
Like this guy could sling the ball all over the place.

1080
00:51:49.12 --> 00:51:54.40
And I played quarterback more as a linebacker, you know, and that was our difference.

1081
00:51:54.40 --> 00:51:58.52
So I would, you know, I would put my head down and, you know, he would, he would throw

1082
00:51:58.52 --> 00:52:01.64
the ball, you know, and slide and things like that.

1083
00:52:01.64 --> 00:52:07.92
And finally they moved me over to tight end my senior year just because I wasn't going

1084
00:52:07.92 --> 00:52:09.36
to get on the field with him.

1085
00:52:09.36 --> 00:52:14.12
But we, we actually split time, first couple of games of the season.

1086
00:52:14.12 --> 00:52:19.44
And I did well, but he wound up like kind of taking command and control and, and, and

1087
00:52:19.44 --> 00:52:20.92
he was like a true leader, true quarterback.

1088
00:52:20.92 --> 00:52:25.40
I was a bit of a knucklehead and wanted to get in fights and run linebackers over, you

1089
00:52:25.40 --> 00:52:27.76
know, and yeah.

1090
00:52:27.76 --> 00:52:31.88
So, that's what, was there a point in your life when you thought you were going to play

1091
00:52:31.88 --> 00:52:34.36
in the NFL?

1092
00:52:34.36 --> 00:52:38.24
I mean, from when I was, you know, five, Jaco, that's what I wanted.

1093
00:52:38.24 --> 00:52:39.24
That's what I wanted to do.

1094
00:52:39.24 --> 00:52:40.24
I should have rephrased that.

1095
00:52:40.24 --> 00:52:43.44
You know, there had to be a point in your life when you were going to play in the NFL.

1096
00:52:43.44 --> 00:52:45.76
When did that dream go out?

1097
00:52:45.76 --> 00:52:48.48
Like when did that flame extinguish?

1098
00:52:48.48 --> 00:52:56.44
That flame extinguished my, it was my, before my senior year.

1099
00:52:56.44 --> 00:52:59.60
So I popped for, I popped for testosterone.

1100
00:52:59.60 --> 00:53:01.12
This is your senior year of college?

1101
00:53:01.12 --> 00:53:02.12
Yeah.

1102
00:53:02.12 --> 00:53:03.12
Yeah.

1103
00:53:03.12 --> 00:53:04.12
Going into the senior year.

1104
00:53:04.12 --> 00:53:05.12
So Marcus, you're moving over to tight end.

1105
00:53:05.12 --> 00:53:06.84
You're going to start at tight end, put on some weight.

1106
00:53:06.84 --> 00:53:07.84
Roger that.

1107
00:53:07.84 --> 00:53:13.76
So I went and found some testosterone, sipping eight and got, got bulky and faster.

1108
00:53:13.76 --> 00:53:19.40
And I remember we were doing off season workouts and the quarterback who, who we were about

1109
00:53:19.40 --> 00:53:24.68
the same speed, I put on 20 pounds and then I started beating him in the, in, in sprints.

1110
00:53:24.68 --> 00:53:26.52
He was like, dude, what the fuck?

1111
00:53:26.52 --> 00:53:30.64
He's like, how can you gain weight and be faster than me all of a sudden?

1112
00:53:30.64 --> 00:53:37.76
So the NCAA came in actually three weeks early and a few of us popped positive for,

1113
00:53:37.76 --> 00:53:41.24
for performance enhancing drugs.

1114
00:53:41.24 --> 00:53:49.12
So that's like, I had a, I had a new guy that was a bicycle rider and he said that when

1115
00:53:49.12 --> 00:53:52.04
you're on, or maybe I just heard this on a, I don't know where I heard this.

1116
00:53:52.04 --> 00:53:53.64
I think I'm just going to know.

1117
00:53:53.64 --> 00:53:55.68
Who said like, he's a bike rider.

1118
00:53:55.68 --> 00:53:59.60
And he said, when someone's on, on juice, it's like they're on a Harley.

1119
00:53:59.60 --> 00:54:01.36
Like you literally just can't hang with them.

1120
00:54:01.36 --> 00:54:03.24
They're just that much better.

1121
00:54:03.24 --> 00:54:08.36
So did you feel like, I mean, it sounds like, dude, you put on 20 pounds and you got faster.

1122
00:54:08.36 --> 00:54:12.88
Oh, I mean, I could, I could dunk a basketball just from a straight vertical leap.

1123
00:54:12.88 --> 00:54:17.40
You know, yeah, it's, it's pretty, pretty, pretty potent stuff.

1124
00:54:17.40 --> 00:54:20.04
When you're, when you're abusing it like that, not when you're like using it for like

1125
00:54:20.04 --> 00:54:23.60
replacement therapy, you know, where they're trying to keep your levels at around.

1126
00:54:23.60 --> 00:54:24.60
Seven or 800.

1127
00:54:24.60 --> 00:54:29.96
We're talking about, you know, 2400, 2000, you know, your blood, your blood levels are

1128
00:54:29.96 --> 00:54:30.96
through the roof.

1129
00:54:30.96 --> 00:54:32.44
And, but you do, you feel like.

1130
00:54:32.44 --> 00:54:34.68
Who's your guide during this?

1131
00:54:34.68 --> 00:54:35.68
Guide?

1132
00:54:35.68 --> 00:54:36.68
Yeah.

1133
00:54:36.68 --> 00:54:37.68
Just bro science.

1134
00:54:37.68 --> 00:54:38.68
This is straight up.

1135
00:54:38.68 --> 00:54:41.80
Bro science, no Google.

1136
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:43.36
This is what three of my buddies said.

1137
00:54:43.36 --> 00:54:45.56
Oh yeah, that guy was in the Marine Corps.

1138
00:54:45.56 --> 00:54:49.28
This guy, you know, took steroids in high school.

1139
00:54:49.28 --> 00:54:50.52
And yeah, we think it's okay.

1140
00:54:50.52 --> 00:54:51.52
You'll be fine.

1141
00:54:51.52 --> 00:54:54.76
So you pop positive.

1142
00:54:54.76 --> 00:54:56.80
I didn't know the NCA was tested back then.

1143
00:54:56.80 --> 00:54:57.80
Yeah.

1144
00:54:57.80 --> 00:54:58.80
I guess I'm just the idiot.

1145
00:54:58.80 --> 00:55:00.12
Yeah, they tested everybody.

1146
00:55:00.12 --> 00:55:04.44
Well, I shouldn't say they tested everybody was random, but.

1147
00:55:04.44 --> 00:55:05.44
And so then are you done?

1148
00:55:05.44 --> 00:55:06.44
Or is that the end of your.

1149
00:55:06.44 --> 00:55:07.44
That's it.

1150
00:55:07.44 --> 00:55:08.60
And I'm done.

1151
00:55:08.60 --> 00:55:12.04
So you said that's the moment when you realized the NFL wasn't happening.

1152
00:55:12.04 --> 00:55:15.28
NFL wasn't happening.

1153
00:55:15.28 --> 00:55:16.28
And you finish.

1154
00:55:16.28 --> 00:55:18.20
How'd your dad feel about that before we go?

1155
00:55:18.20 --> 00:55:19.20
What do you think?

1156
00:55:19.20 --> 00:55:21.68
No, it wasn't your dad.

1157
00:55:21.68 --> 00:55:23.60
No, your dad already left.

1158
00:55:23.60 --> 00:55:25.64
The head coach called.

1159
00:55:25.64 --> 00:55:26.64
They weren't happy.

1160
00:55:26.64 --> 00:55:30.48
But everything, they were always like, ah, it's not Marcus' fault.

1161
00:55:30.48 --> 00:55:32.48
It must have been something else.

1162
00:55:32.48 --> 00:55:33.48
Yeah, my parents.

1163
00:55:33.48 --> 00:55:36.64
Oh, your parents were like, they shifted blame.

1164
00:55:36.64 --> 00:55:38.08
They covered for you a little bit.

1165
00:55:38.08 --> 00:55:41.28
But your dad must have been realizing that the dream was over.

1166
00:55:41.28 --> 00:55:42.28
Probably his dream.

1167
00:55:42.28 --> 00:55:43.28
The NFL dream.

1168
00:55:43.28 --> 00:55:44.28
Yeah, his dream.

1169
00:55:44.28 --> 00:55:45.28
His NFL dream.

1170
00:55:45.28 --> 00:55:49.16
Which by the way, I had like a one in like a trillion chance of making it to the NFL.

1171
00:55:49.16 --> 00:55:50.16
For sure.

1172
00:55:50.16 --> 00:55:51.16
For sure.

1173
00:55:51.16 --> 00:55:57.60
But you got to, I mean, it seems like anybody in pursuing any athletic pursuit that hard

1174
00:55:57.60 --> 00:55:59.80
is going to think, well, I'm going to be able to make it.

1175
00:55:59.80 --> 00:56:03.20
And then at some point you go, it ain't happening.

1176
00:56:03.20 --> 00:56:05.000
You want to go as hard and far as you can.

1177
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Right?

1178
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
I mean, that's, that's all you know.

1179
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Literally, it's all you know.

1180
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.92
I mean, I remember getting in the teams and telling guys and buds like, dude, I never

1181
00:56:11.92 --> 00:56:12.92
turned a wrench.

1182
00:56:12.92 --> 00:56:15.48
Like all I did, all my dad had me do is play ball.

1183
00:56:15.48 --> 00:56:18.16
Like I literally, you know, so I learned a lot.

1184
00:56:18.16 --> 00:56:21.32
And I just, you know, that's why I thought just the teams are so good.

1185
00:56:21.32 --> 00:56:24.84
Cause I just learned a lot of like man shit outside of, you know, playing ball, which

1186
00:56:24.84 --> 00:56:25.84
I look at now.

1187
00:56:25.84 --> 00:56:28.36
I don't even, I don't remember the last time I watched the sporting event, right?

1188
00:56:28.36 --> 00:56:29.36
Yeah.

1189
00:56:29.36 --> 00:56:31.68
You know, I kind of frown upon some of the stuff that's going on.

1190
00:56:31.68 --> 00:56:34.20
It's gross, but yeah.

1191
00:56:34.20 --> 00:56:38.52
So is this when you started thinking about going in the teams?

1192
00:56:38.52 --> 00:56:42.12
Into the teams.

1193
00:56:42.12 --> 00:56:43.92
What was the trigger there?

1194
00:56:43.92 --> 00:56:45.36
You're going to love this.

1195
00:56:45.36 --> 00:56:47.24
This is right up your alley, Jaco.

1196
00:56:47.24 --> 00:56:53.32
So my roommate, of course, dad was a seal in Vietnam.

1197
00:56:53.32 --> 00:56:56.24
I don't think he was.

1198
00:56:56.24 --> 00:56:57.44
He may have been a Marine.

1199
00:56:57.44 --> 00:56:59.000
Wait, what roommate?

1200
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Jason.

1201
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Jason O'Neill.

1202
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Oh.

1203
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Yeah.

1204
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
When he lived in the apartment, remember?

1205
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Yeah.

1206
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
I didn't know he was part of the story.

1207
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.20
I think he's part of the story.

1208
00:57:08.20 --> 00:57:10.36
I'm just thinking, you know, you said I'm going to love this story.

1209
00:57:10.36 --> 00:57:14.68
So I figured like one of your brother, your one of your friends dad was.

1210
00:57:14.68 --> 00:57:17.56
You're going to love it, but then you're going to scratch your head too and be like,

1211
00:57:17.56 --> 00:57:19.36
all right, we're going to go with this, Marcus.

1212
00:57:19.36 --> 00:57:23.36
So we're sitting in the apartment one night.

1213
00:57:23.36 --> 00:57:27.64
And this guy actually started as a freshman, wind up when we graduated.

1214
00:57:27.64 --> 00:57:32.44
I went in the Navy, he went in the Marine Corps, flew F-18s, you know, did the whole

1215
00:57:32.44 --> 00:57:35.36
thing, top gun and all that good stuff.

1216
00:57:35.36 --> 00:57:40.76
And then of course the Marine Corps, what they do to their guys who go to flight school,

1217
00:57:40.76 --> 00:57:44.96
YF-18s and go to top gun, you would expect them to continue flying.

1218
00:57:44.96 --> 00:57:52.60
They handed him an M16 and put him on the ground in Afghanistan, you know, with all

1219
00:57:52.60 --> 00:57:53.76
that training, I guess as a fact.

1220
00:57:53.76 --> 00:57:55.000
Yeah, that's what the Marine Corps does.

1221
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Yeah.

1222
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.04
That's one of the best things that they do is because those guys can talk to aircraft

1223
00:57:59.04 --> 00:58:00.84
better than anybody else.

1224
00:58:00.84 --> 00:58:05.28
And 100% and he did, but he did complain because he said, man, you know, they spent all this

1225
00:58:05.28 --> 00:58:06.76
money on training me how to fly.

1226
00:58:06.76 --> 00:58:08.48
And he's like, I was really good at it.

1227
00:58:08.48 --> 00:58:13.96
And then I'm on the fucking ground in Afghanistan dodging mortars, you know, which he never,

1228
00:58:13.96 --> 00:58:16.24
ever signed up to do.

1229
00:58:16.24 --> 00:58:19.88
So it was just interesting to hear from his perspective, like they don't like it, you

1230
00:58:19.88 --> 00:58:23.96
know, they want to fly and now they're stuck calling in cast.

1231
00:58:23.96 --> 00:58:30.84
One of my really good friends was the same thing, Marine Corps, F-18, top gun instructor,

1232
00:58:30.84 --> 00:58:31.84
top gun senior instructor.

1233
00:58:31.84 --> 00:58:33.40
And he was a fac on the ground.

1234
00:58:33.40 --> 00:58:38.60
He was Anglico team leader in Ramadi with us just getting after it.

1235
00:58:38.60 --> 00:58:43.52
And it's funny because he taught like all the stuff he did in the Marine Corps, he taught

1236
00:58:43.52 --> 00:58:49.84
like he talks about what he did for this one six month deployment to Ramadi because a lot

1237
00:58:49.84 --> 00:58:54.32
different than what it was as I constantly tell him being in an air conditioned cockpit,

1238
00:58:54.32 --> 00:58:56.36
you know, 20,000 feet up in the air.

1239
00:58:56.36 --> 00:58:57.36
That's right.

1240
00:58:57.36 --> 00:58:58.36
Yeah.

1241
00:58:58.36 --> 00:58:59.36
You're right.

1242
00:58:59.36 --> 00:59:02.24
I mean, those guys, can you imagine what kind of perspective they get on the ground and

1243
00:59:02.24 --> 00:59:05.68
then go back up there and go, wait a minute, like I know what it was like down there.

1244
00:59:05.68 --> 00:59:07.60
That's the Marine Corps.

1245
00:59:07.60 --> 00:59:11.44
And I've read some great stories about like the Korean war, those Marine Corps pilots

1246
00:59:11.44 --> 00:59:15.72
that would go and deploy, they're like the Marines, everyone loved them because they

1247
00:59:15.72 --> 00:59:17.88
can just talk to those pilots the way they need to be talked to.

1248
00:59:17.88 --> 00:59:20.88
So I mean, and look, we have the JTACs.

1249
00:59:20.88 --> 00:59:23.28
There's JTACs are awesome too.

1250
00:59:23.28 --> 00:59:27.96
But in the Marine Corps, just with the way they do it and it's pretty freaking cool.

1251
00:59:27.96 --> 00:59:29.56
So this guy is your roommate.

1252
00:59:29.56 --> 00:59:30.56
So my roommate.

1253
00:59:30.56 --> 00:59:39.52
We come home, we throw on the TV and on comes this movie and looking at it and you know,

1254
00:59:39.52 --> 00:59:43.32
it's got people run around and I think you're talking about Sean.

1255
00:59:43.32 --> 00:59:44.84
No, I'm not.

1256
00:59:44.84 --> 00:59:45.84
Okay.

1257
00:59:45.84 --> 00:59:47.96
No, you are incorrect.

1258
00:59:47.96 --> 00:59:48.96
One.

1259
00:59:48.96 --> 00:59:51.56
Amherst incorrect two times out of a hundred.

1260
00:59:51.56 --> 00:59:53.68
I always 98% right.

1261
00:59:53.68 --> 00:59:55.48
I just don't ever remember you living with him.

1262
00:59:55.48 --> 00:59:56.48
Yeah.

1263
00:59:56.48 --> 00:59:57.48
We lived together remember for like six months.

1264
00:59:57.48 --> 00:59:58.48
I don't remember that.

1265
00:59:58.48 --> 00:59:59.48
Okay.

1266
00:59:59.48 --> 01:00:00.48
Sorry.

1267
01:00:00.48 --> 01:00:01.48
I love you.

1268
01:00:01.48 --> 01:00:02.48
It's all good.

1269
01:00:02.48 --> 01:00:03.48
I love you.

1270
01:00:03.48 --> 01:00:07.60
And and they so here G.I. Jane.

1271
01:00:07.60 --> 01:00:08.60
So G.I. Jane comes on.

1272
01:00:08.60 --> 01:00:11.08
I'm just going to get to the point.

1273
01:00:11.08 --> 01:00:12.08
All right.

1274
01:00:12.08 --> 01:00:16.20
G.I. Jane comes on TV and I'm like, what is this?

1275
01:00:16.20 --> 01:00:20.32
And they start talking about, you know, these units and this and that.

1276
01:00:20.32 --> 01:00:24.60
And I have when you were talking about exposure to the military, I hadn't I had none.

1277
01:00:24.60 --> 01:00:28.84
So if I had exposure, I could have maybe called this out right away.

1278
01:00:28.84 --> 01:00:29.84
This was it.

1279
01:00:29.84 --> 01:00:30.84
This was my military.

1280
01:00:30.84 --> 01:00:32.84
I'm like, I want to do that.

1281
01:00:32.84 --> 01:00:34.32
Like this looks hard.

1282
01:00:34.32 --> 01:00:36.28
They said these are the best of the best, right?

1283
01:00:36.28 --> 01:00:38.20
Because they talk about it in there.

1284
01:00:38.20 --> 01:00:41.04
Not not Demi Moore, but the rest of it.

1285
01:00:41.04 --> 01:00:48.28
So that's what actually just told me that there's a unit out there that's special and

1286
01:00:48.28 --> 01:00:51.28
supposed to be the toughest training in the world.

1287
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:56.64
And that's that's what piqued my at least my initial interest to start to look into it

1288
01:00:56.64 --> 01:00:58.60
and go, let me just look into what this is.

1289
01:00:58.60 --> 01:01:03.72
And so, you know, then I read the first book because back then it was there was nothing

1290
01:01:03.72 --> 01:01:06.36
online about the teams.

1291
01:01:06.36 --> 01:01:10.24
So I just I read I literally read every book from Vietnam.

1292
01:01:10.24 --> 01:01:18.36
I mean, everything all and the more I read, the more I got like focused and the more hungry

1293
01:01:18.36 --> 01:01:21.76
and and and, you know, and then nothing else mattered.

1294
01:01:21.76 --> 01:01:23.08
Do you start training at this point?

1295
01:01:23.08 --> 01:01:24.08
I did.

1296
01:01:24.08 --> 01:01:26.000
I did.

1297
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.24
You also met someone who is at SIU and he was a seal, right?

1298
01:01:32.24 --> 01:01:33.24
Yeah.

1299
01:01:33.24 --> 01:01:35.24
Oh, God, I forgot his name from.

1300
01:01:35.24 --> 01:01:36.24
Yeah, from.

1301
01:01:36.24 --> 01:01:37.24
He died in a car accident.

1302
01:01:37.24 --> 01:01:38.24
Yeah, team four.

1303
01:01:38.24 --> 01:01:39.24
I remember.

1304
01:01:39.24 --> 01:01:40.24
I know you're talking about.

1305
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:41.24
Yeah, I thought he was like.

1306
01:01:41.24 --> 01:01:42.24
Will Buschell.

1307
01:01:42.24 --> 01:01:43.24
Will Buschell.

1308
01:01:43.24 --> 01:01:44.24
There you go.

1309
01:01:44.24 --> 01:01:45.24
Will Buschell.

1310
01:01:45.24 --> 01:01:46.80
And so imagine you're in college, you know how it is.

1311
01:01:46.80 --> 01:01:51.000
You want to be a team guy or in high school and then you go, you find out that there's

1312
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.28
a guy that was a team guy.

1313
01:01:53.28 --> 01:01:57.96
So he, of course, he, you know, he slipped people's throats behind enemy lines.

1314
01:01:57.96 --> 01:02:02.000
And like, so every time I saw this guy, I was like, I was in awe, you know, and of course,

1315
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
then when I got the team, they're like, oh, that shit.

1316
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
No, I'm joking.

1317
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I'm totally kidding.

1318
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.12
He actually had a decent reputation.

1319
01:02:08.12 --> 01:02:14.88
But yeah, I looked up to this kid and I was just, you know, I was just hungry after that.

1320
01:02:14.88 --> 01:02:17.60
Jaco, it was nothing mattered.

1321
01:02:17.60 --> 01:02:18.60
I called my parents.

1322
01:02:18.60 --> 01:02:22.24
I told them what I wanted to do and they thought I was crazy.

1323
01:02:22.24 --> 01:02:24.92
Remember that I was crazy.

1324
01:02:24.92 --> 01:02:29.44
But as you know, once you get on that path, nothing else matters.

1325
01:02:29.44 --> 01:02:33.68
And it's nothing but focus and discipline and like, that's it.

1326
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:34.68
What did you do?

1327
01:02:34.68 --> 01:02:36.44
Were you dropping weight?

1328
01:02:36.44 --> 01:02:38.16
Were you because I stopped lifting?

1329
01:02:38.16 --> 01:02:39.16
Got it.

1330
01:02:39.16 --> 01:02:40.16
That's what I did.

1331
01:02:40.16 --> 01:02:44.44
So all I knew was like sport lifting, you know, heavy weights.

1332
01:02:44.44 --> 01:02:48.000
I completely stopped lifting and all I did was body weight workouts.

1333
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.32
So the typical like Stu Smith, I think I had maybe the book, you know, push ups, pull

1334
01:02:51.32 --> 01:02:54.12
ups, sit ups, dips.

1335
01:02:54.12 --> 01:02:55.64
Nobody taught me how to do any of these, by the way.

1336
01:02:55.64 --> 01:02:59.24
Nobody taught me how to even like jog to like, I didn't know anything.

1337
01:02:59.24 --> 01:03:02.80
Like I never jogged, like just went out and ran like six miles.

1338
01:03:02.80 --> 01:03:06.40
Everything was like 40 yard sprints, you know, or maybe hundreds.

1339
01:03:06.40 --> 01:03:07.40
But that was it.

1340
01:03:07.40 --> 01:03:12.60
And so I thought I was like jogging at a good pace until I ran with Sean Toll, who was in

1341
01:03:12.60 --> 01:03:14.84
the army for a long time.

1342
01:03:14.84 --> 01:03:19.84
I went for a run with him and were you jogging slower or I was jogging slower.

1343
01:03:19.84 --> 01:03:21.12
I was like, oh, this is good.

1344
01:03:21.12 --> 01:03:22.12
I'm like, I'm working out.

1345
01:03:22.12 --> 01:03:23.12
This is jogging.

1346
01:03:23.12 --> 01:03:24.72
This is this is jogging.

1347
01:03:24.72 --> 01:03:26.52
And he crushed me.

1348
01:03:26.52 --> 01:03:28.48
Like I couldn't even, I could barely keep up with him.

1349
01:03:28.48 --> 01:03:30.28
And he's like, I'm not even running at a hard pace.

1350
01:03:30.28 --> 01:03:34.20
I went, holy shit, this is like, so he kind of brought me up to another level that I just

1351
01:03:34.20 --> 01:03:35.20
didn't know about.

1352
01:03:35.20 --> 01:03:38.20
So then I started, you know, jogging faster.

1353
01:03:38.20 --> 01:03:41.000
And so this is what you're doing your senior year.

1354
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
This is my senior year.

1355
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
This is my senior year of college.

1356
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.16
Senior, senior year of college.

1357
01:03:45.16 --> 01:03:49.80
And it was like this summer before your senior year that you decided to do this.

1358
01:03:49.80 --> 01:03:52.68
He came to me and said he wanted to be a seal.

1359
01:03:52.68 --> 01:03:54.04
And of course there was no 9-11.

1360
01:03:54.04 --> 01:03:55.48
I didn't know what a seal was.

1361
01:03:55.48 --> 01:03:58.32
I really didn't know the difference between the army and the Navy.

1362
01:03:58.32 --> 01:04:02.12
Although I was, I know I was patriotic, but then I also thought that maybe the military

1363
01:04:02.12 --> 01:04:06.56
wasn't for me based on what I knew about kids from my hometown that went in it.

1364
01:04:06.56 --> 01:04:12.60
And so I thought, you know, it's just a great jumping off point because Marcus was so captivating

1365
01:04:12.60 --> 01:04:18.84
and so cute and such kind of a check in the box for me to be like, I dated the SIU quarterback.

1366
01:04:18.84 --> 01:04:20.76
I don't expect that we'll stay together.

1367
01:04:20.76 --> 01:04:24.32
You know, I thought maybe we'd date for the summer or whatever.

1368
01:04:24.32 --> 01:04:27.20
And we'd been together at that point for two and a half years.

1369
01:04:27.20 --> 01:04:28.96
And I met him at 17.

1370
01:04:28.96 --> 01:04:33.80
So you know, in my mind, like no other guy had ever existed because he was everything

1371
01:04:33.80 --> 01:04:34.80
to me.

1372
01:04:34.80 --> 01:04:39.92
But at the same time, I knew that I was young and I was, you know, very independent.

1373
01:04:39.92 --> 01:04:41.48
And I was raised an only child.

1374
01:04:41.48 --> 01:04:45.76
I have two half brothers who I love like, like brothers.

1375
01:04:45.76 --> 01:04:48.16
And I consider them brothers, but I was raised an only child.

1376
01:04:48.16 --> 01:04:49.56
And so I wanted to be independent.

1377
01:04:49.56 --> 01:04:56.08
I wanted to be, I wanted to graduate and, and move to maybe Chicago or St. Louis.

1378
01:04:56.08 --> 01:04:59.28
I at some point even thought like, maybe I'll move to LA or New York.

1379
01:04:59.28 --> 01:05:01.52
I just wanted to be.

1380
01:05:01.52 --> 01:05:05.64
And when he told me he wanted to go into the military, I thought this is, this is perfect

1381
01:05:05.64 --> 01:05:09.08
because they've kind of been thinking this and we're young and probably not going to

1382
01:05:09.08 --> 01:05:10.68
stay together and get married.

1383
01:05:10.68 --> 01:05:15.12
So by jumping off point, you mean jump off the freaking Marcus train and go your own

1384
01:05:15.12 --> 01:05:16.12
way.

1385
01:05:16.12 --> 01:05:17.12
Yeah.

1386
01:05:17.12 --> 01:05:18.12
But in a healthy way.

1387
01:05:18.12 --> 01:05:21.56
And I talked about it and he's like, you know, these are my goals and this is my vision.

1388
01:05:21.56 --> 01:05:25.84
And I'm like, well, I'm, you know, I'm a couple of years behind June school and I wanted to

1389
01:05:25.84 --> 01:05:26.84
rush a sorority.

1390
01:05:26.84 --> 01:05:32.52
I wanted to be young and be not being this committed relationship.

1391
01:05:32.52 --> 01:05:35.92
And so we, we had super amicably decided to break up.

1392
01:05:35.92 --> 01:05:40.28
So you break up and this is how, when did you talk to a recruiter?

1393
01:05:40.28 --> 01:05:42.000
So that's, that's what I was going to talk about next.

1394
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.56
So I did, I just went on the strip, same place where I ran into the guys coming out of the

1395
01:05:46.56 --> 01:05:47.56
club.

1396
01:05:47.56 --> 01:05:51.40
And there was recruiting, there was a Marine Corps Navy recruiting station there.

1397
01:05:51.40 --> 01:05:57.80
And I went to talk to the Navy recruiter and he was a, he was a diver, combat diver.

1398
01:05:57.80 --> 01:05:59.64
And he was really cool, like really cool.

1399
01:05:59.64 --> 01:06:02.80
And he just said, Hey, he's like, you're, you're at the, you're at school here, right?

1400
01:06:02.80 --> 01:06:03.80
And I said, yeah.

1401
01:06:03.80 --> 01:06:06.24
He said, well, you know, you, you can be an officer.

1402
01:06:06.24 --> 01:06:07.96
And I was like, what's that?

1403
01:06:07.96 --> 01:06:09.60
I literally said, what's that?

1404
01:06:09.60 --> 01:06:11.92
Fucking knucklehead, right?

1405
01:06:11.92 --> 01:06:16.12
Um, he's like, well, you know, you go to college, you get your degree and you know, you could

1406
01:06:16.12 --> 01:06:18.60
become an officer in the military.

1407
01:06:18.60 --> 01:06:22.36
Most people that are enlisted, you know, don't go to college and they enlist and kind of

1408
01:06:22.36 --> 01:06:23.36
explain this.

1409
01:06:23.36 --> 01:06:24.36
Oh, okay.

1410
01:06:24.36 --> 01:06:25.36
Well, that, that sounds cool.

1411
01:06:25.36 --> 01:06:26.74
Like let's do that.

1412
01:06:26.74 --> 01:06:33.44
And so he handed me off to St. Louis, which was running, I guess, um, they, I think they

1413
01:06:33.44 --> 01:06:37.92
managed the individual officer recruitment.

1414
01:06:37.92 --> 01:06:42.44
And again, I didn't like have, I had no mentors, you know, um, you know, as you know, a lot

1415
01:06:42.44 --> 01:06:46.12
of the, you know, the officers that go on either go to the academy or they have, you

1416
01:06:46.12 --> 01:06:48.80
know, congressmen, like they just, they have a better network.

1417
01:06:48.80 --> 01:06:50.56
I just didn't know anybody.

1418
01:06:50.56 --> 01:06:53.40
And so I was training on my own.

1419
01:06:53.40 --> 01:06:59.44
And then the day I had to, uh, he drove the, the, the officer recruiter drove down from

1420
01:06:59.44 --> 01:07:05.88
St. Louis and met me at the university to take my like PRT, CLPRT test.

1421
01:07:05.88 --> 01:07:10.16
I borrowed a pair of, I've been training in sneakers.

1422
01:07:10.16 --> 01:07:11.96
I borrowed a pair of boots because I didn't have any.

1423
01:07:11.96 --> 01:07:13.44
She had to wear boots.

1424
01:07:13.44 --> 01:07:15.44
Um, I'm a size 14.

1425
01:07:15.44 --> 01:07:20.48
I, the only size that was available to me, I think it was like 11 and a half or 12.

1426
01:07:20.48 --> 01:07:29.44
So I, I literally squeezed my feet into these size 12s about the second lap in, I completely

1427
01:07:29.44 --> 01:07:35.24
like both my legs cramped up, uh, finished the run.

1428
01:07:35.24 --> 01:07:41.40
Um, do start doing pushups and I'm doing, uh, what do they call them, uh, grasshopper pushups.

1429
01:07:41.40 --> 01:07:43.16
Oh, like, like little half pushups.

1430
01:07:43.16 --> 01:07:44.16
Yeah.

1431
01:07:44.16 --> 01:07:45.60
Like your elbows are in instead of like out here.

1432
01:07:45.60 --> 01:07:46.76
And he's like, stop.

1433
01:07:46.76 --> 01:07:47.76
I went, what?

1434
01:07:47.76 --> 01:07:49.84
He goes, you're, those aren't, those aren't pushups.

1435
01:07:49.84 --> 01:07:51.48
Those are, we call those grasshopper pushups.

1436
01:07:51.48 --> 01:07:54.28
I was like, well, it's the only ones that I know, you know, so I'm going to keep going.

1437
01:07:54.28 --> 01:07:56.16
Cause I know you, you can't because they don't count.

1438
01:07:56.16 --> 01:07:58.24
You have to move your arms here.

1439
01:07:58.24 --> 01:07:59.92
So the whole test was a complete failure.

1440
01:07:59.92 --> 01:08:02.44
Like I fucked that thing up completely.

1441
01:08:02.44 --> 01:08:07.56
And um, you know, I found out, of course, I didn't get picked up for, for spec war, but

1442
01:08:07.56 --> 01:08:09.52
I got picked up for every other officer program.

1443
01:08:09.52 --> 01:08:12.64
So you come in, go to Nuke, you go to whatever.

1444
01:08:12.64 --> 01:08:19.36
So, um, you can't, can't go to buds and you can transfer after two years.

1445
01:08:19.36 --> 01:08:25.60
And I went, yeah, but you know, the reason, you know, just the only time I actually thought

1446
01:08:25.60 --> 01:08:29.92
a little bit and the only reason I'm going in the military is, is to be a team guy.

1447
01:08:29.92 --> 01:08:35.28
And, and so I just told him like, no, I, you know, I want to go to buds and he said, well,

1448
01:08:35.28 --> 01:08:39.12
you can just go back to the, you know, the recruiter and you can enlist.

1449
01:08:39.12 --> 01:08:40.12
I said, great.

1450
01:08:40.12 --> 01:08:41.12
Can you give me a ride?

1451
01:08:41.12 --> 01:08:42.12
Yeah, give me a ride.

1452
01:08:42.12 --> 01:08:43.12
We shook hands.

1453
01:08:43.12 --> 01:08:48.32
I took my, you know, my little packet that I already started building my record and went

1454
01:08:48.32 --> 01:08:50.20
back to the recruiter.

1455
01:08:50.20 --> 01:08:53.72
And I think I enlisted right there like son, you know, neps.

1456
01:08:53.72 --> 01:08:59.56
I think it was, uh, yeah, or early, I think it was no, or, uh, depths, depths, depths,

1457
01:08:59.56 --> 01:09:00.56
delayed entry.

1458
01:09:00.56 --> 01:09:01.56
Yes.

1459
01:09:01.56 --> 01:09:02.56
That was it.

1460
01:09:02.56 --> 01:09:03.56
And then meps is where it actually happens.

1461
01:09:03.56 --> 01:09:04.56
Yeah, exactly.

1462
01:09:04.56 --> 01:09:05.56
Yeah, you're right.

1463
01:09:05.56 --> 01:09:08.64
So you, in the, how long was it like when you enlisted, how many, how long does it have

1464
01:09:08.64 --> 01:09:10.28
to wait before you could leave?

1465
01:09:10.28 --> 01:09:12.16
It was quick.

1466
01:09:12.16 --> 01:09:13.92
And we'll get, yeah, we can get in that story.

1467
01:09:13.92 --> 01:09:17.08
But from when I talked to the recruiter, I think it was about six months.

1468
01:09:17.08 --> 01:09:20.80
So I was, you know, I'd show up every month and they'd have like little gatherings or

1469
01:09:20.80 --> 01:09:26.16
whatever, but I was still training, um, starting to get a little bit indoctrinated into the,

1470
01:09:26.16 --> 01:09:27.16
into the military.

1471
01:09:27.16 --> 01:09:31.36
So were you guys, were you guys split up when you actually signed the papers?

1472
01:09:31.36 --> 01:09:32.36
No.

1473
01:09:32.36 --> 01:09:34.64
Uh, we were actually living together.

1474
01:09:34.64 --> 01:09:35.64
Oh, dang.

1475
01:09:35.64 --> 01:09:36.64
And I don't remember that.

1476
01:09:36.64 --> 01:09:37.64
No, I'm just kidding.

1477
01:09:37.64 --> 01:09:41.60
And yeah, you were just training and getting ready.

1478
01:09:41.60 --> 01:09:46.56
And we knew that, you know, the end was coming, but we were still together.

1479
01:09:46.56 --> 01:09:47.56
Okay.

1480
01:09:47.56 --> 01:09:49.80
And then you signed the papers and now you got your date.

1481
01:09:49.80 --> 01:09:51.32
Hey, you're going to leave on this date.

1482
01:09:51.32 --> 01:09:52.32
I'm going to leave.

1483
01:09:52.32 --> 01:10:01.72
I'm going to leave on this date, uh, which was June 15th, 2000.

1484
01:10:01.72 --> 01:10:04.48
And I don't know, when did you tell me?

1485
01:10:04.48 --> 01:10:09.32
You were also finishing, he had his last semester in school, which ended in December

1486
01:10:09.32 --> 01:10:10.32
and then you did your internship.

1487
01:10:10.32 --> 01:10:11.32
Well, then I did my internship.

1488
01:10:11.32 --> 01:10:15.80
I did my internship for four weeks, no, four months at the Breaker's Resort in Palm Beach,

1489
01:10:15.80 --> 01:10:16.80
Florida.

1490
01:10:16.80 --> 01:10:17.80
What is it?

1491
01:10:17.80 --> 01:10:18.80
It was an terrible internship.

1492
01:10:18.80 --> 01:10:19.80
It was like resort management.

1493
01:10:19.80 --> 01:10:24.76
Like I basically got paid to be a, uh, a cabana boy and like get tips.

1494
01:10:24.76 --> 01:10:25.76
I mean, literally.

1495
01:10:25.76 --> 01:10:28.72
And then two weeks run the children's like kid program.

1496
01:10:28.72 --> 01:10:29.72
It was crazy.

1497
01:10:29.72 --> 01:10:34.000
And that's what you did from December until, until April.

1498
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
April.

1499
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Yeah.

1500
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.16
So April came back, graduated, didn't walk.

1501
01:10:38.16 --> 01:10:40.96
I didn't really care about like walking across the stage to me that wasn't.

1502
01:10:40.96 --> 01:10:43.96
We're missing a huge chunk of that.

1503
01:10:43.96 --> 01:10:45.20
Don't go too far into the story.

1504
01:10:45.20 --> 01:10:46.20
Oh, where do you want me to stop?

1505
01:10:46.20 --> 01:10:48.72
Because, well, in May, 2000.

1506
01:10:48.72 --> 01:10:51.04
Okay, good.

1507
01:10:51.04 --> 01:10:58.000
So in the summertime, July, August, school starting is when we decided, this will be

1508
01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.24
our last semester together.

1509
01:10:59.24 --> 01:11:01.000
I knew he was going to leave at the end of the semester.

1510
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.72
I also had an aunt who was dying of breast cancer and so, and I was working full time.

1511
01:11:05.72 --> 01:11:07.000
I had 18 credit hours.

1512
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.64
I was working 30 hours a week.

1513
01:11:08.64 --> 01:11:09.96
My aunt was dying.

1514
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:17.32
And so, um, for a couple of months I was thinking like, I'm not sure I feel quite right, but

1515
01:11:17.32 --> 01:11:23.76
I just kept delaying what I would soon realize was the inevitable, which was taking a pregnancy

1516
01:11:23.76 --> 01:11:24.76
test.

1517
01:11:24.76 --> 01:11:25.76
Oh.

1518
01:11:25.76 --> 01:11:34.28
And I finally took this test in October, um, and I had been pregnant since August.

1519
01:11:34.28 --> 01:11:41.40
So I was about 12 weeks pregnant with our son when I found out and he was set to leave

1520
01:11:41.40 --> 01:11:44.12
in two months in December.

1521
01:11:44.12 --> 01:11:45.72
Set to leave for the Navy.

1522
01:11:45.72 --> 01:11:46.72
For his internship.

1523
01:11:46.72 --> 01:11:47.72
For all for the internship.

1524
01:11:47.72 --> 01:11:48.72
Followed by the Navy.

1525
01:11:48.72 --> 01:11:49.72
Okay.

1526
01:11:49.72 --> 01:11:50.72
Okay, so got it.

1527
01:11:50.72 --> 01:11:51.72
Now I'm tracking.

1528
01:11:51.72 --> 01:11:53.20
Hey, I'm still trying to track the story.

1529
01:11:53.20 --> 01:11:55.52
So it's a long time ago.

1530
01:11:55.52 --> 01:11:58.12
So, so, was there a whirlwind and what did you do?

1531
01:11:58.12 --> 01:12:04.88
I mean, so freaked out completely freaked out and Marcus was so supportive.

1532
01:12:04.88 --> 01:12:08.44
Initially he's like, he's like, this is going to be fine.

1533
01:12:08.44 --> 01:12:09.44
Like we're going to be parents.

1534
01:12:09.44 --> 01:12:10.84
It's going to be fine.

1535
01:12:10.84 --> 01:12:15.68
And here he is like all this, these dreams and plans and I was the one freaking out.

1536
01:12:15.68 --> 01:12:18.36
And then he told his parents and they freaked out.

1537
01:12:18.36 --> 01:12:20.000
And when they freaked out, he freaked out.

1538
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.76
When he freaked out, I really freaked out.

1539
01:12:21.76 --> 01:12:23.20
There's a lot of freaking out.

1540
01:12:23.20 --> 01:12:25.64
There's a lot of freaking out.

1541
01:12:25.64 --> 01:12:27.12
Freaking out, shit, it rolls downhill.

1542
01:12:27.12 --> 01:12:28.12
Obviously.

1543
01:12:28.12 --> 01:12:29.80
Well, I just thought like my life is over.

1544
01:12:29.80 --> 01:12:35.000
It's absolutely, I was so excited about this new beginning and it's over.

1545
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.80
And I now see that is the beginning.

1546
01:12:39.80 --> 01:12:42.000
That's the beginning of everything.

1547
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.48
Thank God.

1548
01:12:43.48 --> 01:12:45.08
Wow.

1549
01:12:45.08 --> 01:12:50.92
So you find out in October, then in December you're going to be a cabana boy in Florida.

1550
01:12:50.92 --> 01:12:51.92

01:13:33.40 --> 01:13:34.40
You ran to.

1575
01:13:34.40 --> 01:13:35.40
I mean, I trained my ass off down there.

1576
01:13:35.40 --> 01:13:36.40
No, I did.

1577
01:13:36.40 --> 01:13:38.92
But you're working 17 jobs or whatever with 18 credit hours.

1578
01:13:38.92 --> 01:13:39.92
You're just like.

1579
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:41.92
I think I took 15 then in the spring.

1580
01:13:41.92 --> 01:13:45.16
But yeah, I was working full time and going to school.

1581
01:13:45.16 --> 01:13:47.76
I was nine months pregnant and taking finals.

1582
01:13:47.76 --> 01:13:48.76
It was.

1583
01:13:48.76 --> 01:13:49.76
Amber worked forever.

1584
01:13:49.76 --> 01:13:52.52
Like from the day I met her, she was always working.

1585
01:13:52.52 --> 01:13:55.76
Like nonstop and it hasn't stopped.

1586
01:13:55.76 --> 01:13:57.80
So the reason we're still here.

1587
01:13:57.80 --> 01:13:59.48
Um, yeah, she worked her ass off.

1588
01:13:59.48 --> 01:14:00.48
She really did.

1589
01:14:00.48 --> 01:14:01.48
She's a grinder.

1590
01:14:01.48 --> 01:14:06.92
And then how did this whole scenario impact your decision to go in the Navy?

1591
01:14:06.92 --> 01:14:09.48
It, I mean, it really didn't.

1592
01:14:09.48 --> 01:14:11.88
Like I was, this is what I want to do.

1593
01:14:11.88 --> 01:14:19.36
I, you know, at 23, I, I, I didn't, I didn't even think about what it was like to start

1594
01:14:19.36 --> 01:14:21.04
a family.

1595
01:14:21.04 --> 01:14:22.80
But then again, what were we supposed to do?

1596
01:14:22.80 --> 01:14:27.20
I was supposed to graduate and then get a job, you know, like, well, here's your job.

1597
01:14:27.20 --> 01:14:28.20
Yeah.

1598
01:14:28.20 --> 01:14:29.96
I mean, here's, here's your job.

1599
01:14:29.96 --> 01:14:31.80
How are you making, you know, how are you making money?

1600
01:14:31.80 --> 01:14:34.64
Again, you know, my dad handed me a ball when I was three.

1601
01:14:34.64 --> 01:14:36.36
Um, I don't know.

1602
01:14:36.36 --> 01:14:37.36
I was scared to death.

1603
01:14:37.36 --> 01:14:41.32
Honestly, I remember saying, I'm supposed to put on a shirt and tie now and go step

1604
01:14:41.32 --> 01:14:46.12
off in the private sector and get a job, you know, doing what and making what to support,

1605
01:14:46.12 --> 01:14:47.12
support the family.

1606
01:14:47.12 --> 01:14:48.12
Like I was scared to death too.

1607
01:14:48.12 --> 01:14:50.12
Then once I started really thinking about it.

1608
01:14:50.12 --> 01:14:54.80
But the Navy seemed like the viable option to have a family.

1609
01:14:54.80 --> 01:14:59.04
The Navy seemed at that time comfortable, you know,

1610
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:00.04
Yeah.

1611
01:15:00.04 --> 01:15:01.04
It's like paycheck healthcare, paycheck healthcare.

1612
01:15:01.04 --> 01:15:02.04
Yeah.

1613
01:15:02.04 --> 01:15:04.84
And I think that's some of the, probably advice I got from individuals.

1614
01:15:04.84 --> 01:15:05.84
I don't remember.

1615
01:15:05.84 --> 01:15:08.92
I mean, I think maybe I talked to a few, just say, Hey, you'll, you know, she'll be taken

1616
01:15:08.92 --> 01:15:14.20
care of, you'll be taken care of, you make a few hundred dollars more if you're married.

1617
01:15:14.20 --> 01:15:15.20
Whoa.

1618
01:15:15.20 --> 01:15:19.04
Um, and at that time when you don't have any, uh, money.

1619
01:15:19.04 --> 01:15:22.76
And I don't think anybody, I mean, my parents are definitely not supporting us.

1620
01:15:22.76 --> 01:15:27.88
And I mean, Amber's family of course would have, but we, I don't think we were thinking

1621
01:15:27.88 --> 01:15:28.88
about that.

1622
01:15:28.88 --> 01:15:29.88
No.

1623
01:15:29.88 --> 01:15:31.96
So you end up getting married prior to leaving?

1624
01:15:31.96 --> 01:15:32.96
Yeah.

1625
01:15:32.96 --> 01:15:38.64
Well, we spent most of my pregnancy apart and not just because he was in Florida.

1626
01:15:38.64 --> 01:15:44.52
It's because, you know, we had this whole like existential crisis where we didn't know

1627
01:15:44.52 --> 01:15:51.52
how to make this new curve ball fit and there was, there were several months when I thought,

1628
01:15:51.52 --> 01:15:53.28
I'm just going to raise this baby.

1629
01:15:53.28 --> 01:15:59.04
You know, I, I absolutely thought about ending the pregnancy and I couldn't, there was no

1630
01:15:59.04 --> 01:16:00.48
way I could.

1631
01:16:00.48 --> 01:16:03.52
And I thought, I don't care what this means.

1632
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:04.96
I don't care how hard this is.

1633
01:16:04.96 --> 01:16:07.80
I'm just going to figure it out.

1634
01:16:07.80 --> 01:16:15.80
And, um, you know, even if that meant doing it by myself and Marcus was in the, um, kids

1635
01:16:15.80 --> 01:16:26.000
area, like he had alluded to earlier, and we had picked our son's name before he left.

1636
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.56
And at the time no one was naming their kid, Caden.

1637
01:16:28.56 --> 01:16:32.16
You know, it was like he wanted to name him Caden's.

1638
01:16:32.16 --> 01:16:36.80
I think we saw in a baby name book and he's like, Oh, it's like the quarterback calling

1639
01:16:36.80 --> 01:16:37.80
Caden's.

1640
01:16:37.80 --> 01:16:39.60
He's like, but it sounds like a girl's name.

1641
01:16:39.60 --> 01:16:41.40
So let's shorten it.

1642
01:16:41.40 --> 01:16:46.92
And there was this little baby that came in when he was at the breakers named Caden.

1643
01:16:46.92 --> 01:16:48.80
And we'd never heard that name before.

1644
01:16:48.80 --> 01:16:52.40
And so he called me that night and he was like, I can't do this anymore.

1645
01:16:52.40 --> 01:16:54.32
Let's figure this out.

1646
01:16:54.32 --> 01:16:56.80
And so that's what we did.

1647
01:16:56.80 --> 01:16:58.36
And we named him Caden.

1648
01:16:58.36 --> 01:17:01.40
We named him Caden of battle, of war.

1649
01:17:01.40 --> 01:17:03.48
That's the, that was the ready for battle.

1650
01:17:03.48 --> 01:17:04.48
Ready for battle.

1651
01:17:04.48 --> 01:17:05.48
That's the, that was the meaning.

1652
01:17:05.48 --> 01:17:07.04
That was a cool name.

1653
01:17:07.04 --> 01:17:08.04
Jack.

1654
01:17:08.04 --> 01:17:09.04
Why not?

1655
01:17:09.04 --> 01:17:10.64
I mean, I tried to call him like Nico.

1656
01:17:10.64 --> 01:17:15.20
Oh, Nico Vito and major were his three names of choice, but I wasn't going for that.

1657
01:17:15.20 --> 01:17:19.12
So yeah, we, we, Caden was born in May of 2000.

1658
01:17:19.12 --> 01:17:23.48
Marcus came back, proposed.

1659
01:17:23.48 --> 01:17:26.88
We got married in June of 2000.

1660
01:17:26.88 --> 01:17:32.68
And then six days later he, he left for boot camp.

1661
01:17:32.68 --> 01:17:33.68
Typical story.

1662
01:17:33.68 --> 01:17:35.88
Just like most Americans, right?

1663
01:17:35.88 --> 01:17:39.48
And did you stay like at home in Illinois?

1664
01:17:39.48 --> 01:17:40.48
I did.

1665
01:17:40.48 --> 01:17:41.48
When he left for boot camp and everything?

1666
01:17:41.48 --> 01:17:42.48
Cause there's no point in doing anything else.

1667
01:17:42.48 --> 01:17:43.48
Yeah.

1668
01:17:43.48 --> 01:17:46.76
I couldn't, you know, move the Navy wasn't going to move me, but of course, and then

1669
01:17:46.76 --> 01:17:48.36
he had to go to a school and C school.

1670
01:17:48.36 --> 01:17:50.24
It's be a sonar tech.

1671
01:17:50.24 --> 01:17:55.52
And so when he was finished with C school and he was getting ready for Bud's in dock,

1672
01:17:55.52 --> 01:17:56.68
I was able to move out.

1673
01:17:56.68 --> 01:17:58.24
Caden was nine months old at the time.

1674
01:17:58.24 --> 01:17:59.68
So I was 21.

1675
01:17:59.68 --> 01:18:04.66
I'd never been away from my little, you know, tiny town in Southern Illinois and we moved

1676
01:18:04.66 --> 01:18:06.24
to the towers in Coronado.

1677
01:18:06.24 --> 01:18:12.76
And so he would walk to work, like, you know, walk to Bud's every morning.

1678
01:18:12.76 --> 01:18:13.76
We had no money.

1679
01:18:13.76 --> 01:18:17.88
No, we were raking in the money at 1,082 per paycheck.

1680
01:18:17.88 --> 01:18:18.88
And our rent was 1,000.

1681
01:18:18.88 --> 01:18:19.88
I was going to say, what was the rent?

1682
01:18:19.88 --> 01:18:20.88
A thousand.

1683
01:18:20.88 --> 01:18:22.88
So we got a little bit of help from mom and dad.

1684
01:18:22.88 --> 01:18:23.88
A little bit.

1685
01:18:23.88 --> 01:18:24.88
Not really.

1686
01:18:24.88 --> 01:18:25.88
Not really.

1687
01:18:25.88 --> 01:18:26.88
Not really.

1688
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:27.88
You're right.

1689
01:18:27.88 --> 01:18:31.32
We just racked up a lot of credit card bills.

1690
01:18:31.32 --> 01:18:33.44
And now you're rolling into Bud's.

1691
01:18:33.44 --> 01:18:34.44
Rolling into Bud's.

1692
01:18:34.44 --> 01:18:35.44
How are you?

1693
01:18:35.44 --> 01:18:36.44
How's your preparation?

1694
01:18:36.44 --> 01:18:37.44
Are you good?

1695
01:18:37.44 --> 01:18:38.44
I'm good.

1696
01:18:38.44 --> 01:18:39.44
Yeah, really good.

1697
01:18:39.44 --> 01:18:42.96
And you joined in May, June, July.

1698
01:18:42.96 --> 01:18:45.40
So when September 11th, when is that?

1699
01:18:45.40 --> 01:18:46.40
What's your career?

1700
01:18:46.40 --> 01:18:47.40
Where are you at?

1701
01:18:47.40 --> 01:18:48.40
Yeah.

1702
01:18:48.40 --> 01:18:49.40
We should.

1703
01:18:49.40 --> 01:18:50.40
We should.

1704
01:18:50.40 --> 01:18:51.40
We should.

1705
01:18:51.40 --> 01:18:52.40
We should.

1706
01:18:52.40 --> 01:18:53.40
Were you in A school?

1707
01:18:53.40 --> 01:18:54.40
No.

1708
01:18:54.40 --> 01:18:55.40
We'll get into it.

1709
01:18:55.40 --> 01:18:56.40
No, I was in third phase.

1710
01:18:56.40 --> 01:18:57.40
Oh, damn.

1711
01:18:57.40 --> 01:18:58.64
What's your first phase?

1712
01:18:58.64 --> 01:19:00.44
First phase was good.

1713
01:19:00.44 --> 01:19:04.44
So I showed up 175.

1714
01:19:04.44 --> 01:19:05.44
Started.

1715
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:06.44
Wait, 175 pounds?

1716
01:19:06.44 --> 01:19:07.44
No, no, no.

1717
01:19:07.44 --> 01:19:08.44
I'm sorry.

1718
01:19:08.44 --> 01:19:10.16
The number of students.

1719
01:19:10.16 --> 01:19:11.16
People in the class.

1720
01:19:11.16 --> 01:19:12.32
Got it.

1721
01:19:12.32 --> 01:19:17.80
So I show up and I look around and there's a lot.

1722
01:19:17.80 --> 01:19:18.80
I mean, that's a lot of people.

1723
01:19:18.80 --> 01:19:19.80
175 is a lot.

1724
01:19:19.80 --> 01:19:20.80
Yeah.

1725
01:19:20.80 --> 01:19:25.28
And all I keep hearing is one in four are going to make it, like 25%.

1726
01:19:25.28 --> 01:19:29.88
And honestly, the first thing I thought of was, how can I be one of these one in four?

1727
01:19:29.88 --> 01:19:31.32
There's so many people here.

1728
01:19:31.32 --> 01:19:36.96
And again, I don't even consider myself, I'm not a big guy compared to the guys I played

1729
01:19:36.96 --> 01:19:38.24
ball with in college.

1730
01:19:38.24 --> 01:19:40.68
But everybody else there was like, oh, Marcus is a big guy.

1731
01:19:40.68 --> 01:19:41.68
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1732
01:19:41.68 --> 01:19:42.68
How tall are you?

1733
01:19:42.68 --> 01:19:43.68
6'4".

1734
01:19:43.68 --> 01:19:44.68
And how much did you weigh when you started BUDS?

1735
01:19:44.68 --> 01:19:46.56
Like two and a quarter, two and a quarter, 225.

1736
01:19:46.56 --> 01:19:48.28
That's a big dude going through BUDS.

1737
01:19:48.28 --> 01:19:49.28
Yeah.

1738
01:19:49.28 --> 01:19:50.48
And I was just FYI.

1739
01:19:50.48 --> 01:19:55.80
I was like, just turned 19 and I was 174 pounds when I got there.

1740
01:19:55.80 --> 01:19:56.80
I was like a little kid.

1741
01:19:56.80 --> 01:19:57.80
It was so awesome.

1742
01:19:57.80 --> 01:20:01.40
We had guys, like you probably like, you had guys in BUDS that gained weight during BUDS.

1743
01:20:01.40 --> 01:20:02.40
I did.

1744
01:20:02.40 --> 01:20:03.40
I gained 10 pounds.

1745
01:20:03.40 --> 01:20:04.40
I gained 10 pounds.

1746
01:20:04.40 --> 01:20:07.08
But like, if you, you, you were what, 23, 24?

1747
01:20:07.08 --> 01:20:08.08
That's 23.

1748
01:20:08.08 --> 01:20:09.08
Yeah.

1749
01:20:09.08 --> 01:20:10.08
So you're like a man.

1750
01:20:10.08 --> 01:20:11.08
I was a man-ish.

1751
01:20:11.08 --> 01:20:12.08
Well, I was not really.

1752
01:20:12.08 --> 01:20:13.08
Well, I was like.

1753
01:20:13.08 --> 01:20:14.08
Physically, physically, you were pretty close.

1754
01:20:14.08 --> 01:20:15.08
I think you were 24 when you started BUDS.

1755
01:20:15.08 --> 01:20:17.08
That'd be questionable to the instructors if we were men, right?

1756
01:20:17.08 --> 01:20:18.08
What's that?

1757
01:20:18.08 --> 01:20:19.72
I think you were 24 when you started BUDS.

1758
01:20:19.72 --> 01:20:21.32
I was like, who's counting?

1759
01:20:21.32 --> 01:20:22.32
I don't know.

1760
01:20:22.32 --> 01:20:23.32
All of us run together.

1761
01:20:23.32 --> 01:20:24.96
So you're in pretty good shape.

1762
01:20:24.96 --> 01:20:25.96
You're in good shape.

1763
01:20:25.96 --> 01:20:29.000
I'm in good shape, but this is, this is where I'm getting at.

1764
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.72
So I look around and see these guys and all of a sudden, you know, we start doing the

1765
01:20:31.72 --> 01:20:35.76
in-doc and everybody is just in phenomenal shape.

1766
01:20:35.76 --> 01:20:37.48
They can do pull-ups forever.

1767
01:20:37.48 --> 01:20:39.24
They can run forever.

1768
01:20:39.24 --> 01:20:40.56
You know, I'm still a little heavy.

1769
01:20:40.56 --> 01:20:44.76
So for me, pull-ups, I can do them, but I can't do, like, I was watching guys do like

1770
01:20:44.76 --> 01:20:51.20
20, 30, 40, 50 at one time or run our class.

1771
01:20:51.20 --> 01:20:56.80
I swear we had at least 10 individuals, you know, Mike Murphy, Nelson Sanchez.

1772
01:20:56.80 --> 01:21:02.48
These guys were running sub 24-minute, four-mile timer.

1773
01:21:02.48 --> 01:21:07.84
Murph and Sanchez would always be like, that's insane.

1774
01:21:07.84 --> 01:21:08.84
It was insane.

1775
01:21:08.84 --> 01:21:09.84
Right?

1776
01:21:09.84 --> 01:21:12.56
And I was, you know, I never, so this was cool about the runs.

1777
01:21:12.56 --> 01:21:18.76
I never, I was in the Goon Squad literally one day, one time.

1778
01:21:18.76 --> 01:21:20.28
Never failed four-mile time run.

1779
01:21:20.28 --> 01:21:23.08
I never got Gooned except the one time.

1780
01:21:23.08 --> 01:21:28.96
So like for me, the running, I did it and I, you know, I got ahead of the Goon Squad,

1781
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:30.84
but it was miserable, you know.

1782
01:21:30.84 --> 01:21:32.000
What class were you in?

1783
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
236.

1784
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
236.

1785
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Check.

1786
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Yeah.

1787
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And so, so third phase, Jaco.

1788
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
So we're in third phase.

1789
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.36
We'll go back to first phase.

1790
01:21:39.36 --> 01:21:40.36
Yeah.

1791
01:21:40.36 --> 01:21:45.92
I was in good shape, but again, I look around and see 175 guys and I was nervous.

1792
01:21:45.92 --> 01:21:49.64
And then after I started seeing guys work out and then guys doing, literally doing splits,

1793
01:21:49.64 --> 01:21:51.60
I'm like, am I in the right place?

1794
01:21:51.60 --> 01:21:55.20
Like these guys are, these are just some freaks here, you know, like Olympic swimmers

1795
01:21:55.20 --> 01:21:58.72
and all these, these, these crazy individuals.

1796
01:21:58.72 --> 01:22:03.12
And then as you know, class starts in the loudest, it is wild.

1797
01:22:03.12 --> 01:22:04.12
It's wild.

1798
01:22:04.12 --> 01:22:06.12
In the loudest screamers, all of a sudden you're like, hey, we're so-and-so.

1799
01:22:06.12 --> 01:22:07.88
He, you know, he talked a lot of shit.

1800
01:22:07.88 --> 01:22:10.96
You can't even comprehend it.

1801
01:22:10.96 --> 01:22:14.000
Like we were talking before we started recording.

1802
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.56
It's like you and I have survivors by us, meaning every friend I have 100% made it through

1803
01:22:20.56 --> 01:22:21.56
buds.

1804
01:22:21.56 --> 01:22:24.04
So as far as I know, the freaking pass rate for buds is 100%.

1805
01:22:24.04 --> 01:22:25.88
So you know, like, oh, everyone made it.

1806
01:22:25.88 --> 01:22:27.88
Everyone, everyone I know made it.

1807
01:22:27.88 --> 01:22:32.04
But yeah, the wild thing is the people that like you said, like Olympic swimmers and Olympic

1808
01:22:32.04 --> 01:22:37.60
this and D won this and D won track guys and D won football players and everything.

1809
01:22:37.60 --> 01:22:38.60
And they all just quit.

1810
01:22:38.60 --> 01:22:39.60
It's insane.

1811
01:22:39.60 --> 01:22:40.60
Yeah.

1812
01:22:40.60 --> 01:22:42.20
They all go away pretty quickly.

1813
01:22:42.20 --> 01:22:46.04
Was there anything in Hell Week that like tripped you up or were you just like, hell

1814
01:22:46.04 --> 01:22:47.04
yeah.

1815
01:22:47.04 --> 01:22:53.36
No, the other reason I say hell yeah for me is because I, I like sucked at everything

1816
01:22:53.36 --> 01:22:54.36
while it sucked.

1817
01:22:54.36 --> 01:22:58.40
I was, I was okay at everything, but I had to put out really hard to pass runs.

1818
01:22:58.40 --> 01:23:00.04
I had to put out really hard to pass the Oakhurst.

1819
01:23:00.04 --> 01:23:02.08
I had to put out really hard to pass the swims.

1820
01:23:02.08 --> 01:23:06.48
And look, everyone's put now, but I had to put, put out really hard to pass the evolutions.

1821
01:23:06.48 --> 01:23:09.88
But in Hell Week, it wasn't, it's not pass fail.

1822
01:23:09.88 --> 01:23:11.36
It's just keep going.

1823
01:23:11.36 --> 01:23:13.92
Which there's anything I'm okay at.

1824
01:23:13.92 --> 01:23:15.36
It's like, oh, I can keep going.

1825
01:23:15.36 --> 01:23:17.08
I will, I will keep going.

1826
01:23:17.08 --> 01:23:21.76
And so for me, Hell Week was almost like a break because you just had to keep going,

1827
01:23:21.76 --> 01:23:23.36
which I was good at everything else.

1828
01:23:23.36 --> 01:23:24.36
Like I did.

1829
01:23:24.36 --> 01:23:25.36
I failed.

1830
01:23:25.36 --> 01:23:27.36
I failed a four mile time.

1831
01:23:27.36 --> 01:23:29.24
I, I paced myself.

1832
01:23:29.24 --> 01:23:30.24
I was an idiot.

1833
01:23:30.24 --> 01:23:31.24
Yeah.

1834
01:23:31.24 --> 01:23:32.24
I mean, I wasn't fast enough to pace.

1835
01:23:32.24 --> 01:23:33.24
I just needed to sprint.

1836
01:23:33.24 --> 01:23:37.80
I failed a swim and again, like a bunch of people failed to swim and I was one of them.

1837
01:23:37.80 --> 01:23:38.80
So that sucked.

1838
01:23:38.80 --> 01:23:41.04
I don't know if I failed in an obstacle course.

1839
01:23:41.04 --> 01:23:46.48
I probably did, but like, so I was kind of middle of the pack, but it was cause I was

1840
01:23:46.48 --> 01:23:47.48
putting out hard.

1841
01:23:47.48 --> 01:23:49.44
So for me, Hell Week was like, cool.

1842
01:23:49.44 --> 01:23:51.32
And a bunch of people quit.

1843
01:23:51.32 --> 01:23:52.32
A bunch of people quit.

1844
01:23:52.32 --> 01:23:55.60
And I was like, damn, are you dumb?

1845
01:23:55.60 --> 01:23:56.60
Like yeah.

1846
01:23:56.60 --> 01:23:58.16
And a lot of those individuals were up front.

1847
01:23:58.16 --> 01:23:59.16
Oh yeah.

1848
01:23:59.16 --> 01:24:00.16
It's insane.

1849
01:24:00.16 --> 01:24:01.16
Yeah.

1850
01:24:01.16 --> 01:24:02.16
We had some pipe hitters.

1851
01:24:02.16 --> 01:24:05.84
Some like legit good, I shouldn't say pipe hitters cause they're not, they're good athletes.

1852
01:24:05.84 --> 01:24:06.84
Right.

1853
01:24:06.84 --> 01:24:08.16
They're good athletes.

1854
01:24:08.16 --> 01:24:10.08
And yeah, it doesn't really matter, man.

1855
01:24:10.08 --> 01:24:11.60
Get tired, wet and cold.

1856
01:24:11.60 --> 01:24:14.40
We had, I mean, we had a bunch of Rangers and Marines in our class.

1857
01:24:14.40 --> 01:24:21.08
We had some Egyptian officers in the class and it was, it was diverse.

1858
01:24:21.08 --> 01:24:25.70
But you know, I, I did have trouble on the runs, but like you, I put out.

1859
01:24:25.70 --> 01:24:31.24
So I had to really put out hard to stay up and pass the runs.

1860
01:24:31.24 --> 01:24:34.36
I couldn't, I couldn't like keep it back a year.

1861
01:24:34.36 --> 01:24:40.20
You know, I had a, I had to really put out, but no, I, everything I did was, um, I did,

1862
01:24:40.20 --> 01:24:41.20
I did okay.

1863
01:24:41.20 --> 01:24:47.32
I remember one time they pulled me out of the log PT because everybody was literally

1864
01:24:47.32 --> 01:24:52.12
just, it was falling on their head and I was just, I don't know, I was in a different gear

1865
01:24:52.12 --> 01:24:54.88
and they're like opponents sit down like a higher gear, like doing better.

1866
01:24:54.88 --> 01:24:55.88
Yeah.

1867
01:24:55.88 --> 01:24:56.88
Yeah.

1868
01:24:56.88 --> 01:25:01.16
I just felt, I felt, I felt good, you know, with the log and they made me sit down one

1869
01:25:01.16 --> 01:25:02.16
time.

1870
01:25:02.16 --> 01:25:07.64
They're like, you know, just sit down because you're, you're, you're doing all right.

1871
01:25:07.64 --> 01:25:12.60
Um, it was one time at how we, I think it was, what was it called, elephant?

1872
01:25:12.60 --> 01:25:13.60
Elephant cage?

1873
01:25:13.60 --> 01:25:14.60
Elephant runs.

1874
01:25:14.60 --> 01:25:15.60
Oh, elephant runs.

1875
01:25:15.60 --> 01:25:16.60
Yeah.

1876
01:25:16.60 --> 01:25:17.60
When you're like holding.

1877
01:25:17.60 --> 01:25:18.60
Yeah.

1878
01:25:18.60 --> 01:25:20.000
So there was, there was one day I was super dehydrated and I remember this and, uh, like

1879
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.86
I thought I was going to die and I kept trying to like pull back.

1880
01:25:23.86 --> 01:25:28.36
So like guys would run and I would, I was literally trying to like pull it back because I couldn't,

1881
01:25:28.36 --> 01:25:30.000
I couldn't keep up.

1882
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.16
And you know, I was getting yelled at.

1883
01:25:31.16 --> 01:25:33.08
I'm like, guys, I don't know what's going on.

1884
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:36.20
Like I, I can't, I can't do anything right now.

1885
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:38.64
And I barely made it through that evolution.

1886
01:25:38.64 --> 01:25:39.64
I remember it.

1887
01:25:39.64 --> 01:25:40.64
It was, it was miserable.

1888
01:25:40.64 --> 01:25:43.04
I remember it to this day because you know how it is.

1889
01:25:43.04 --> 01:25:44.96
You just, everybody hits a point, right?

1890
01:25:44.96 --> 01:25:48.76
And I hit that point where I could not, I felt like I couldn't go any further.

1891
01:25:48.76 --> 01:25:51.64
And the only thing that kept me going was like probably the guys behind me, like kicking

1892
01:25:51.64 --> 01:25:52.64
me in the ass.

1893
01:25:52.64 --> 01:25:55.000
Like, Hey dude, like keep going.

1894
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.96
Um, and then there was a, there was a rock hump when we used to do, uh, you know, like

1895
01:25:59.96 --> 01:26:04.52
you used to do the, of course, throw in a pack, whatever it was, three miles.

1896
01:26:04.52 --> 01:26:09.92
There was a time there also that I felt like I was about to like pass out.

1897
01:26:09.92 --> 01:26:10.92
Something was wrong.

1898
01:26:10.92 --> 01:26:14.56
And I remember one of the guys in the class and I remember, never forget this, Ben Souters,

1899
01:26:14.56 --> 01:26:18.48
who you know, a lot of guys made fun of because he grew up in the Midwest and he was a Bible

1900
01:26:18.48 --> 01:26:22.68
beater and he never cursed and he never drank and never did anything.

1901
01:26:22.68 --> 01:26:24.000
He comes running up past me.

1902
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.40
He's like, Hey man, what's, what's wrong with you?

1903
01:26:25.40 --> 01:26:26.80
I said, I don't know.

1904
01:26:26.80 --> 01:26:29.04
I was like, I'm, I'm about to die.

1905
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:32.48
He's like, I'm going to stay with you and I'm going to, is that cool?

1906
01:26:32.48 --> 01:26:34.04
I'm like, yeah, absolutely.

1907
01:26:34.04 --> 01:26:36.12
He ran with me the whole way until we finished.

1908
01:26:36.12 --> 01:26:38.12
And this was because you were dehydrated or something?

1909
01:26:38.12 --> 01:26:40.12
Yeah, probably just like dehydrated or whatever.

1910
01:26:40.12 --> 01:26:45.52
So those are like the two times I just remember at Bud's where it was like, you're about to,

1911
01:26:45.52 --> 01:26:47.48
you're going to die, you know?

1912
01:26:47.48 --> 01:26:49.60
But other than that, how about dive phase?

1913
01:26:49.60 --> 01:26:51.000
How are you in the pool?

1914
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Cause you surfed.

1915
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.92
I like, yeah, I like the water.

1916
01:26:53.92 --> 01:26:58.56
I think I had some trouble with, um, pool comp with pool comp.

1917
01:26:58.56 --> 01:26:59.76
Like everybody else does.

1918
01:26:59.76 --> 01:27:05.36
Um, my, I think if I remember, I'm exhalation, not almost fricking drowned because I'm like,

1919
01:27:05.36 --> 01:27:11.40
Hey, there's water going in my, my tube here and it's not supposed to be, you know?

1920
01:27:11.40 --> 01:27:17.32
So you come up and like, I'm trying to explain myself to the instructor staff and they just

1921
01:27:17.32 --> 01:27:18.32
jumped all over me.

1922
01:27:18.32 --> 01:27:22.44
I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, just listen, just hear me out one time.

1923
01:27:22.44 --> 01:27:26.36
I was talking pool comp with Andy stumped the other day up at Jiu-Jitsu camp because

1924
01:27:26.36 --> 01:27:27.36
he was an instructor.

1925
01:27:27.36 --> 01:27:36.32
He was a third phase instructor and you know how that, that, that, he's just like so hilarious.

1926
01:27:36.32 --> 01:27:40.64
And but he's telling me from like his instructor point of view of what he would do and what

1927
01:27:40.64 --> 01:27:43.76
he would see and how he would do it.

1928
01:27:43.76 --> 01:27:45.28
And like he's laughing hysterically.

1929
01:27:45.28 --> 01:27:49.000
Like, and I go, how many people did you, I go, were you like the hard instructor?

1930
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.44
He's like, Oh yeah, I go, how many people did you pass?

1931
01:27:51.44 --> 01:27:52.44
Oh no.

1932
01:27:52.44 --> 01:27:54.92
I said, I said, were you like the hard instructor?

1933
01:27:54.92 --> 01:28:00.12
And he goes, I passed three people three years or four people three years past his pool comp.

1934
01:28:00.12 --> 01:28:01.12
Everyone else failed.

1935
01:28:01.12 --> 01:28:06.72
And he said the guys that passed, he said, I respected him because you know, he put them

1936
01:28:06.72 --> 01:28:08.12
through hell.

1937
01:28:08.12 --> 01:28:09.12
Yeah.

1938
01:28:09.12 --> 01:28:15.12
Andy, we did Andy's podcast and Andy put me through jump training on East Coast.

1939
01:28:15.12 --> 01:28:17.72
And he was, you know, and he knows this.

1940
01:28:17.72 --> 01:28:22.52
He was, he was such a dick to all of us, except if you're in his like his circle, you know,

1941
01:28:22.52 --> 01:28:25.12
but it was cool to see him up in Montana.

1942
01:28:25.12 --> 01:28:27.12
And yeah, it was great.

1943
01:28:27.12 --> 01:28:28.12
Just what he's got going on now.

1944
01:28:28.12 --> 01:28:29.12
And he was awesome.

1945
01:28:29.12 --> 01:28:34.56
He's one of the best, you know, obviously one of the most talented jumpers that I could

1946
01:28:34.56 --> 01:28:35.56
get to.

1947
01:28:35.56 --> 01:28:37.04
And one of the most talented wiseasses.

1948
01:28:37.04 --> 01:28:39.04
Like just so good.

1949
01:28:39.04 --> 01:28:44.84
But yeah, you got to have him debrief you on his experience as a, he was a freaking dive

1950
01:28:44.84 --> 01:28:48.96
instructor, a second phase instructor for like a couple years.

1951
01:28:48.96 --> 01:28:53.56
So he was telling me about how like he'd watched the kids hands and when their hands would

1952
01:28:53.56 --> 01:28:58.52
go into this like involuntary claw like motion and he goes, yeah, that's when I knew I'd

1953
01:28:58.52 --> 01:28:59.52
had him.

1954
01:28:59.52 --> 01:29:06.08
It's like, good God, I cannot imagine him having more fun torturing people, but I guess

1955
01:29:06.08 --> 01:29:07.08
he's doing it.

1956
01:29:07.08 --> 01:29:08.08
And then you're in.

1957
01:29:08.08 --> 01:29:14.08
So then you get to third phase, third phase and third phase I couldn't, couldn't wait

1958
01:29:14.08 --> 01:29:16.32
for I think like most, most guys.

1959
01:29:16.32 --> 01:29:19.56
And yeah, third phase is great.

1960
01:29:19.56 --> 01:29:27.16
The only problems I had there out on the island, we, we made a really shitty hide site for

1961
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:30.96
like, you know, your, your day that you're supposed to take hours to do it.

1962
01:29:30.96 --> 01:29:32.76
It was, it was so pathetic.

1963
01:29:32.76 --> 01:29:40.36
Jaco that one of the instructors came out, I don't want to say his name, but he lost

1964
01:29:40.36 --> 01:29:41.36
his shit.

1965
01:29:41.36 --> 01:29:46.12
He lost his shit so bad that I think if a, if a, some type of brass was there, they might

1966
01:29:46.12 --> 01:29:49.12
have thrown him in jail.

1967
01:29:49.12 --> 01:29:50.12
He flipped out on us.

1968
01:29:50.12 --> 01:29:54.16
He took one of the students like just threw him every rich direction.

1969
01:29:54.16 --> 01:29:57.84
I think put his boot in the guy's chest and like kicked him a mile, you know, it was one

1970
01:29:57.84 --> 01:29:58.84
of those things.

1971
01:29:58.84 --> 01:30:02.44
We were scared to death and then we worked on that hide for another four hours and chose

1972
01:30:02.44 --> 01:30:03.44
tight.

1973
01:30:03.44 --> 01:30:05.40
But so, but because of that, we had to sleep on the beach.

1974
01:30:05.40 --> 01:30:06.40
It was a camp stupid.

1975
01:30:06.40 --> 01:30:12.52
So I got to sleep at camp stupid, which you really don't sleep because I was getting,

1976
01:30:12.52 --> 01:30:16.96
I was trying to sleep on the ice with those ice plants and ice plants had nothing, but

1977
01:30:16.96 --> 01:30:20.80
some kind of nasty bug that was just biting us all night.

1978
01:30:20.80 --> 01:30:22.48
So we didn't get any sleep.

1979
01:30:22.48 --> 01:30:24.32
Some kind of sand fleece scenario.

1980
01:30:24.32 --> 01:30:25.32
It was bad.

1981
01:30:25.32 --> 01:30:26.32
So, yeah.

1982
01:30:26.32 --> 01:30:31.08
So that was my, my third phase experience and, uh, well also the towers came down.

1983
01:30:31.08 --> 01:30:32.08
Well, then the towers came down.

1984
01:30:32.08 --> 01:30:39.84
So we're up at, um, we're training out East, you know, in the desert and, um, structure

1985
01:30:39.84 --> 01:30:45.68
comes out from the house there and says, Hey, uh, US is being attacked.

1986
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:48.72
Uh, World Trade Center just got hit by, by an airplane.

1987
01:30:48.72 --> 01:30:53.52
And we all looked at each other and we're like, man, can these fucking guys just leave

1988
01:30:53.52 --> 01:30:54.52
us alone?

1989
01:30:54.52 --> 01:30:55.52
Like we're in third phase.

1990
01:30:55.52 --> 01:30:57.000
We're, this is a conversation.

1991
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.32
We're about to graduate and they're still messing with us.

1992
01:30:59.32 --> 01:31:00.40
Like what did we do wrong?

1993
01:31:00.40 --> 01:31:02.64
Like we, we had a shitty second phase.

1994
01:31:02.64 --> 01:31:04.76
I should, I shouldn't talk about that.

1995
01:31:04.76 --> 01:31:08.000
Um, we had a really shitty second phase, but, um,

1996
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.12
Well, just, I actually did me and, and I'm going to, I'm going to name him, uh, me and,

1997
01:31:14.12 --> 01:31:15.12
me and Jeff boss.

1998
01:31:15.12 --> 01:31:21.16
So he and I are, are swim budding into the bathroom and we go running out and our, our,

1999
01:31:21.16 --> 01:31:27.12
uh, our proctor was a guy by the name of, uh, you know, Favaro money, uh, super laid

2000
01:31:27.12 --> 01:31:29.36
back Sdv guy.

2001
01:31:29.36 --> 01:31:33.84
Like probably the, actually we were told the only instructor that you can't piss off.

2002
01:31:33.84 --> 01:31:37.24
Like it's impossible to piss him off.

2003
01:31:37.24 --> 01:31:42.48
We somehow figured out how to do that because we were running to the bathroom.

2004
01:31:42.48 --> 01:31:49.04
We didn't see him and he called us evidently like three times and we didn't answer and

2005
01:31:49.04 --> 01:31:52.28
he fucking flipped his lid because of that.

2006
01:31:52.28 --> 01:31:55.52
And because the cadre was like, yeah, he doesn't ever flip out.

2007
01:31:55.52 --> 01:31:58.72
Like we've seen him for like 15 years.

2008
01:31:58.72 --> 01:32:04.80
They made us spin the wheel of misfortune every day for this was the first day of second

2009
01:32:04.80 --> 01:32:05.80
phase.

2010
01:32:05.80 --> 01:32:09.72
And every day just you and your swim buddy, no, the whole class, which is even better.

2011
01:32:09.72 --> 01:32:10.72
Right.

2012
01:32:10.72 --> 01:32:14.04
So we got really, we got, we made a lot of friends after that.

2013
01:32:14.04 --> 01:32:17.48
So the wheel of misfortune, I've talked to classes like before and after us.

2014
01:32:17.48 --> 01:32:23.80
Like, oh, we, we spun it like twice, like twice a week or like, no, no, the whole phase.

2015
01:32:23.80 --> 01:32:27.44
I'm like, we spun it every single day.

2016
01:32:27.44 --> 01:32:28.56
We got back from our dive.

2017
01:32:28.56 --> 01:32:29.72
So we'd get back from our dive.

2018
01:32:29.72 --> 01:32:30.72
Didn't matter.

2019
01:32:30.72 --> 01:32:31.72
One o'clock midnight.

2020
01:32:31.72 --> 01:32:32.72
It didn't matter.

2021
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:34.24
Put all your stuff away.

2022
01:32:34.24 --> 01:32:35.24
Get back in the grinder.

2023
01:32:35.24 --> 01:32:37.12
Spin, you know, spin the wheel of misfortune.

2024
01:32:37.12 --> 01:32:39.52
Oh, 200 eight counts go.

2025
01:32:39.52 --> 01:32:44.36
So we did that every day for second phase, which I was told like never happens.

2026
01:32:44.36 --> 01:32:49.16
And it was just like a miserable second phase because we had to do, you know, more PT for

2027
01:32:49.16 --> 01:32:50.36
like an extra hour or whatever.

2028
01:32:50.36 --> 01:32:51.36
So it sucked.

2029
01:32:51.36 --> 01:32:54.04
Third phase, we're still being harassed.

2030
01:32:54.04 --> 01:32:55.52
We thought it was a joke.

2031
01:32:55.52 --> 01:32:56.96
They march us in.

2032
01:32:56.96 --> 01:32:59.36
We watch it on TV for 30 seconds.

2033
01:32:59.36 --> 01:33:04.28
We marched back out to the grinder and we just didn't have any idea what was about to

2034
01:33:04.28 --> 01:33:05.28
happen.

2035
01:33:05.28 --> 01:33:10.24
The cadre, their demeanor was completely different.

2036
01:33:10.24 --> 01:33:12.52
I'm getting chills, you know, talking about it.

2037
01:33:12.52 --> 01:33:16.80
But you can tell like they knew what was about to happen.

2038
01:33:16.80 --> 01:33:22.40
And I remember them like having this like hatred and just, you know, like we're about

2039
01:33:22.40 --> 01:33:23.80
to go to war guys.

2040
01:33:23.80 --> 01:33:25.32
And we're just like, no, we're out here.

2041
01:33:25.32 --> 01:33:26.32
We're in buds.

2042
01:33:26.32 --> 01:33:27.32
We're on the beach.

2043
01:33:27.32 --> 01:33:29.16
We're working out.

2044
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:32.28
And the demeanor from the class, which is all we want to do is get through buds.

2045
01:33:32.28 --> 01:33:33.96
This sucks.

2046
01:33:33.96 --> 01:33:37.28
From their demeanor, which was like, we're going to war.

2047
01:33:37.28 --> 01:33:38.28
Like this is what's happening.

2048
01:33:38.28 --> 01:33:40.16
And it was totally different.

2049
01:33:40.16 --> 01:33:44.72
And from that day forward, from the last part of third phase, like they were serious.

2050
01:33:44.72 --> 01:33:48.88
It wasn't more of this like joking crew of cadre.

2051
01:33:48.88 --> 01:33:53.60
Like they were like, this was real.

2052
01:33:53.60 --> 01:33:59.48
This was not the shit, you know, that, in all honesty, that some people signed up for.

2053
01:33:59.48 --> 01:34:03.20
I mean, there was, right after that, there was a few guys from SQT.

2054
01:34:03.20 --> 01:34:05.88
And one, in one in particular, I remember quit in SQT.

2055
01:34:05.88 --> 01:34:09.32
It was like, I didn't sign up to go to war, you know, with the college and whatever.

2056
01:34:09.32 --> 01:34:13.48
So I think some people, this was like, obviously a big reality check for us.

2057
01:34:13.48 --> 01:34:17.24
I don't think we knew any different because we were just trying to get through buds.

2058
01:34:17.24 --> 01:34:18.36
So damn.

2059
01:34:18.36 --> 01:34:25.32
So Amber, this whole time your new husband is coming home freaking with the shit beat

2060
01:34:25.32 --> 01:34:26.32
out of him.

2061
01:34:26.32 --> 01:34:29.16
And he's working crazy hours and all this.

2062
01:34:29.16 --> 01:34:35.52
Like what's your, what's your impression of this whole scenario before September 11th?

2063
01:34:35.52 --> 01:34:39.20
I really jockeau thought we just have to get to the end of buds.

2064
01:34:39.20 --> 01:34:42.48
I literally thought after the six months of training, things are going to really even

2065
01:34:42.48 --> 01:34:43.48
out.

2066
01:34:43.48 --> 01:34:49.24
I mean, even minus nine, 11, that, you know, nothing could have been further from the truth.

2067
01:34:49.24 --> 01:34:52.84
But in my mind, that was like at least something that was an end goal.

2068
01:34:52.84 --> 01:34:59.68
And so all of the late nights and ice baths and I don't, I just need to stay on the couch

2069
01:34:59.68 --> 01:35:00.68
all weekend.

2070
01:35:00.68 --> 01:35:04.60
Like that to me was going to come to an end and life was going to be normal again.

2071
01:35:04.60 --> 01:35:11.56
It's also some of the sweetest times because he was so spent and I look back at photos

2072
01:35:11.56 --> 01:35:16.80
of our one year old climbing all over him and he's got both knees, you know, wrapped

2073
01:35:16.80 --> 01:35:19.96
with ice and he's trying to be a dad.

2074
01:35:19.96 --> 01:35:25.16
And, you know, we've got pictures at the zoo and I can see how beat down he was being

2075
01:35:25.16 --> 01:35:27.32
a bud student and trying to be a dad.

2076
01:35:27.32 --> 01:35:32.92
He came home one night on our anniversary and it was like, you know, midnight, like he'd

2077
01:35:32.92 --> 01:35:37.04
missed the anniversary and he had geraniums picked from our apartment complex.

2078
01:35:37.04 --> 01:35:38.76
And it was the sweetest thing.

2079
01:35:38.76 --> 01:35:44.16
Like he was still trying so hard to be sort of this dual role.

2080
01:35:44.16 --> 01:35:47.64
And after nine, 11, like it's like cadre.

2081
01:35:47.64 --> 01:35:49.56
I mean, he completely changed.

2082
01:35:49.56 --> 01:35:57.76
And what about, did you realize what an impact September 11th was going to have from the

2083
01:35:57.76 --> 01:36:03.76
perspective of when I was going in the SEAL teams and it was 1990, 1991.

2084
01:36:03.76 --> 01:36:05.36
I thought I was going to Vietnam.

2085
01:36:05.36 --> 01:36:06.36
I thought I was going to Vietnam.

2086
01:36:06.36 --> 01:36:10.64
Like I thought, hey, there's SEALs just sneaking around the world, just killing people.

2087
01:36:10.64 --> 01:36:12.28
And that's what I was going to be doing.

2088
01:36:12.28 --> 01:36:14.68
So I just thought that's the way the SEAL teams was.

2089
01:36:14.68 --> 01:36:15.68
That's what you did.

2090
01:36:15.68 --> 01:36:19.04
Then I got to the SEAL teams and it wasn't like that in the 90s.

2091
01:36:19.04 --> 01:36:21.06
It was not like that at all.

2092
01:36:21.06 --> 01:36:24.80
So did you have the impression like, hey, he's going to war anyways?

2093
01:36:24.80 --> 01:36:28.20
Or were you like, oh, once this is, once he gets done with the SEAL training, we're going

2094
01:36:28.20 --> 01:36:31.64
to be, you know, able to just kind of live normal lives.

2095
01:36:31.64 --> 01:36:35.28
But now this September 11th happens.

2096
01:36:35.28 --> 01:36:42.08
I didn't know what had happened because I went from being an independent sophomore to

2097
01:36:42.08 --> 01:36:46.80
a pregnant college student to a wife and a mom.

2098
01:36:46.80 --> 01:36:48.76
And now 9-11 happens.

2099
01:36:48.76 --> 01:36:54.44
And my birthday is on September 12th today.

2100
01:36:54.44 --> 01:36:56.12
And thank you.

2101
01:36:56.12 --> 01:36:59.76
My mom had come to visit in 2001.

2102
01:36:59.76 --> 01:37:03.60
Yeah, 2000, 9-11.

2103
01:37:03.60 --> 01:37:05.52
Oh my gosh.

2104
01:37:05.52 --> 01:37:06.88
It's 21 years.

2105
01:37:06.88 --> 01:37:07.88
Okay.

2106
01:37:07.88 --> 01:37:08.88
Yeah.

2107
01:37:08.88 --> 01:37:09.88
Sorry.

2108
01:37:09.88 --> 01:37:10.88
01.

2109
01:37:10.88 --> 01:37:11.88
Yes.

2110
01:37:11.88 --> 01:37:18.64
Anyway, my mom had come to visit and I remember telling her like, I think he's at war.

2111
01:37:18.64 --> 01:37:19.64
Like, I think he's gone.

2112
01:37:19.64 --> 01:37:20.64
He was on the island.

2113
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:21.64
I had no idea.

2114
01:37:21.64 --> 01:37:24.20
I'm like, I think he's probably going to leave like today.

2115
01:37:24.20 --> 01:37:28.28
And we also, it was just a crazy time.

2116
01:37:28.28 --> 01:37:32.20
I had no idea how much it would.

2117
01:37:32.20 --> 01:37:33.80
Yeah, I think anybody's dead.

2118
01:37:33.80 --> 01:37:34.80
Yeah.

2119
01:37:34.80 --> 01:37:38.40
Even, I mean, from my perspective, I had been in the SEAL teams for like 10 years at this

2120
01:37:38.40 --> 01:37:45.92
point and, you know, you thought like everyone was, I was paranoid that, you know, I wasn't

2121
01:37:45.92 --> 01:37:46.92
going to get any.

2122
01:37:46.92 --> 01:37:47.92
I wasn't going to miss it.

2123
01:37:47.92 --> 01:37:48.92
It was going to be over.

2124
01:37:48.92 --> 01:37:51.16
Like everyone was feeling like that.

2125
01:37:51.16 --> 01:37:56.36
And because it seemed like it would last for, you know what, six months, maybe, maybe.

2126
01:37:56.36 --> 01:37:59.08
I wouldn't even, I was about to say maybe a year, but I don't think anyone thought,

2127
01:37:59.08 --> 01:38:02.68
oh, this is going to go on for a full year.

2128
01:38:02.68 --> 01:38:04.32
Like we would do some strikes.

2129
01:38:04.32 --> 01:38:06.20
We would do some hits, take out some targets.

2130
01:38:06.20 --> 01:38:08.80
And then that would be that.

2131
01:38:08.80 --> 01:38:13.88
I would love to hear someone tell me that they knew it was going to last 20 freaking years.

2132
01:38:13.88 --> 01:38:16.08
I would, I would be very suspect.

2133
01:38:16.08 --> 01:38:21.80
Now I did have some officer, senior officer friends of me that said, when I was like,

2134
01:38:21.80 --> 01:38:23.88
hey, get me back to a team, please now.

2135
01:38:23.88 --> 01:38:26.28
They were like, hey, this is going to go on a while.

2136
01:38:26.28 --> 01:38:29.72
I'll give them credit for, for thinking that and for telling me that.

2137
01:38:29.72 --> 01:38:35.16
But almost everybody was like, oh, we need to get over now.

2138
01:38:35.16 --> 01:38:38.88
If you don't get it now, it'll be another, you know, because the first goal for you,

2139
01:38:38.88 --> 01:38:42.56
but you kind of based some stuff off the first goal for, which was 72 hours.

2140
01:38:42.56 --> 01:38:43.56
Yeah.

2141
01:38:43.56 --> 01:38:45.44
It was 72 hours.

2142
01:38:45.44 --> 01:38:49.32
And then you could say, oh, this is going to end in Ukraine, right?

2143
01:38:49.32 --> 01:38:51.32
Right away, everyone said, oh, this is going to end.

2144
01:38:51.32 --> 01:38:52.32
It's going to be a month.

2145
01:38:52.32 --> 01:38:53.32
Yeah.

2146
01:38:53.32 --> 01:38:54.32
And now it's like, wait a minute.

2147
01:38:54.32 --> 01:38:55.32
Yeah.

2148
01:38:55.32 --> 01:38:56.32
Oh, wait a minute.

2149
01:38:56.32 --> 01:38:57.32
It's a it's it's a lot different.

2150
01:38:57.32 --> 01:38:58.32
Yeah.

2151
01:38:58.32 --> 01:39:03.12
So I think that everybody in the community, no one, no one that I talked to was like,

2152
01:39:03.12 --> 01:39:05.56
oh, this is going to last two decades.

2153
01:39:05.56 --> 01:39:11.24
That wasn't even a thought.

2154
01:39:11.24 --> 01:39:13.68
Did you go to SQT on the West Coast?

2155
01:39:13.68 --> 01:39:14.68
Yes.

2156
01:39:14.68 --> 01:39:16.68
So you did like the group SQT.

2157
01:39:16.68 --> 01:39:20.40
That was like, I think I was the first, I think it was the second class where they didn't

2158
01:39:20.40 --> 01:39:22.04
do the STT anymore.

2159
01:39:22.04 --> 01:39:23.04
Everyone did SQT.

2160
01:39:23.04 --> 01:39:27.36
You didn't get your, well, actually you got your, you got your Trident when you graduated

2161
01:39:27.36 --> 01:39:28.36
SQT.

2162
01:39:28.36 --> 01:39:29.84
Oh, so that was that was your class?

2163
01:39:29.84 --> 01:39:31.72
That was the class, I think before us.

2164
01:39:31.72 --> 01:39:39.36
I think it was like, it was, was it like, yeah, like Goggins and Brent.

2165
01:39:39.36 --> 01:39:42.36
I know it was relatively new.

2166
01:39:42.36 --> 01:39:49.72
And I remember to jog out thinking like, I'm so happy that he's going to get to do something

2167
01:39:49.72 --> 01:39:57.24
with all this training because, you know, sales during times of peace versus, you know,

2168
01:39:57.24 --> 01:40:04.48
9-11 on, I'm sure it's a very different way of living and deploying and being.

2169
01:40:04.48 --> 01:40:08.32
And I just thought like, I know it's been a, you know, it's been peaceful times for a

2170
01:40:08.32 --> 01:40:10.44
while and good for him.

2171
01:40:10.44 --> 01:40:15.08
I'm glad that he gets to actually utilize this training.

2172
01:40:15.08 --> 01:40:18.64
And I also remember thinking, seals are so incredible.

2173
01:40:18.64 --> 01:40:20.52
They, nothing, you know, they don't die.

2174
01:40:20.52 --> 01:40:22.20
I guess you, you know, you hadn't heard.

2175
01:40:22.20 --> 01:40:29.16
And I was, my thinking back then was so naive, but I never was afraid like he can't do this

2176
01:40:29.16 --> 01:40:36.84
anymore or I was actually very, I was afraid, but I wasn't thinking that I needed to intervene.

2177
01:40:36.84 --> 01:40:41.72
I was very supportive of, you know, of him deploying.

2178
01:40:41.72 --> 01:40:43.72
Yeah.

2179
01:40:43.72 --> 01:40:46.92
That's so crazy because you're young.

2180
01:40:46.92 --> 01:40:51.68
We're all, I mean, I think I saw us in the Navy for 13 years before I shot my weapon

2181
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:52.68
at the enemy.

2182
01:40:52.68 --> 01:40:55.000
So 13 years that you're talking about like this peace time.

2183
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.48
And I actually, it was awesome.

2184
01:40:57.48 --> 01:40:58.48
Like I had a great time.

2185
01:40:58.48 --> 01:41:03.76
Like we worked hard, we trained hard, we were hanging out with our friends.

2186
01:41:03.76 --> 01:41:06.64
We were trying to be ready for combat, which was the big thing that we didn't know and

2187
01:41:06.64 --> 01:41:07.64
didn't understand.

2188
01:41:07.64 --> 01:41:10.44
So you're kind of preparing for something that you don't really, that you really don't

2189
01:41:10.44 --> 01:41:11.44
understand.

2190
01:41:11.44 --> 01:41:16.80
But I really loved the job of being a seal, even if the job is just going out and going

2191
01:41:16.80 --> 01:41:18.68
into the desert and doing desert warfare training.

2192
01:41:18.68 --> 01:41:19.84
I love that job.

2193
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:21.84
It's an awesome job.

2194
01:41:21.84 --> 01:41:26.72
But I mean, what you're talking about, Amber, like the fact that you feel that as like a

2195
01:41:26.72 --> 01:41:31.08
mom and a wife, even you felt like I'm glad he's going to get to do his job.

2196
01:41:31.08 --> 01:41:32.88
Imagine what the dudes are like.

2197
01:41:32.88 --> 01:41:36.32
The dudes are like, oh, you know, it was, it was.

2198
01:41:36.32 --> 01:41:41.04
I mean, we used to, I hate saying this because it sounds so freaking horrible, but we used

2199
01:41:41.04 --> 01:41:44.84
to like pray for war, like just want to go to war so bad.

2200
01:41:44.84 --> 01:41:47.24
We just, that's what we wanted to do.

2201
01:41:47.24 --> 01:41:53.88
And yeah, it's, we got, we got what we asked for.

2202
01:41:53.88 --> 01:41:55.76
We got what we asked for.

2203
01:41:55.76 --> 01:41:58.84
I was going to ask you about SQT.

2204
01:41:58.84 --> 01:42:01.24
So you go through SQT.

2205
01:42:01.24 --> 01:42:06.80
And now that must have been, those dudes must have been like fully full on like we're going

2206
01:42:06.80 --> 01:42:07.80
to war.

2207
01:42:07.80 --> 01:42:08.80
You guys are all going to war.

2208
01:42:08.80 --> 01:42:09.80
Yeah, absolutely.

2209
01:42:09.80 --> 01:42:10.80
It was, it was weird too.

2210
01:42:10.80 --> 01:42:11.80
It was like a transition.

2211
01:42:11.80 --> 01:42:17.24
So they're ringing guys in that had just gone overseas and done something and like after

2212
01:42:17.24 --> 01:42:18.24
actions.

2213
01:42:18.24 --> 01:42:23.20
And so like all of a sudden the shift started changing from like H gear to stuff that actually,

2214
01:42:23.20 --> 01:42:24.40
you know, fits you and works.

2215
01:42:24.40 --> 01:42:34.04
And we also had, I think 11, 11 guys in the SQT class that came back that had gotten out

2216
01:42:34.04 --> 01:42:35.04
right after 9 11.

2217
01:42:35.04 --> 01:42:36.04
They came back in.

2218
01:42:36.04 --> 01:42:40.04
So we had all these guys that were team guys before went out in the private sector.

2219
01:42:40.04 --> 01:42:41.04
Like, oh, 9 11.

2220
01:42:41.04 --> 01:42:42.04
That's your point, Amber.

2221
01:42:42.04 --> 01:42:45.96
Like, can you imagine you're a dude, you're in the team for four years or six years, you

2222
01:42:45.96 --> 01:42:49.16
get out of the teams, you're going out, you're doing whatever you're doing outside the war

2223
01:42:49.16 --> 01:42:50.16
kicks off.

2224
01:42:50.16 --> 01:42:51.16
You're like, I'm going back in.

2225
01:42:51.16 --> 01:42:53.96
I'm throwing everything I have away all built up, whatever I'm going back in.

2226
01:42:53.96 --> 01:42:56.32
Because that's what dudes wanted to do.

2227
01:42:56.32 --> 01:42:57.32
Exactly.

2228
01:42:57.32 --> 01:43:00.76
So you get your tried at the end of SQT.

2229
01:43:00.76 --> 01:43:02.64
What team did you go to?

2230
01:43:02.64 --> 01:43:03.76
I went to 10.

2231
01:43:03.76 --> 01:43:05.04
They just commissioned 10 and seven.

2232
01:43:05.04 --> 01:43:12.56
So half the class went to seven or STV one and then half of us went to 10.

2233
01:43:12.56 --> 01:43:14.92
Did you keep your try date when you got there?

2234
01:43:14.92 --> 01:43:19.04
Because I know I heard some good stories like some teams were taking your try date and painting

2235
01:43:19.04 --> 01:43:20.04
it blue.

2236
01:43:20.04 --> 01:43:21.04
So it was inert.

2237
01:43:21.04 --> 01:43:22.04
Two and four?

2238
01:43:22.04 --> 01:43:23.04
Two and four?

2239
01:43:23.04 --> 01:43:24.04
Yeah.

2240
01:43:24.04 --> 01:43:25.04
Like you showed up, you didn't have it.

2241
01:43:25.04 --> 01:43:26.04
You got it ripped off.

2242
01:43:26.04 --> 01:43:28.72
I think as soon as you came across the quarter deck, they just ripped it off.

2243
01:43:28.72 --> 01:43:31.96
I want to say somebody at STV was telling me they took their Tridents and put them into

2244
01:43:31.96 --> 01:43:32.96
a bird cage.

2245
01:43:32.96 --> 01:43:33.96
That's what they did on the East Coast.

2246
01:43:33.96 --> 01:43:35.44
So they put them in bird cages.

2247
01:43:35.44 --> 01:43:38.96
You can look at it, but you can't have it.

2248
01:43:38.96 --> 01:43:45.68
And of course the guys who struggled, they had to keep their Tridents in the bird cage

2249
01:43:45.68 --> 01:43:49.24
a lot longer than guys that were squared away.

2250
01:43:49.24 --> 01:43:56.80
But we did get beat into our chest from the instructor staff at SQT while all the families

2251
01:43:56.80 --> 01:43:57.80
were there and stuff.

2252
01:43:57.80 --> 01:44:03.80
So that was, at least we felt like it was something there, but maybe not so much compared

2253
01:44:03.80 --> 01:44:04.80
to how it used to be.

2254
01:44:04.80 --> 01:44:05.80
Compared to how it used to be.

2255
01:44:05.80 --> 01:44:06.80
Yeah, it was cool.

2256
01:44:06.80 --> 01:44:10.84
I checked into the team and we went through something called SEAL tactical training at

2257
01:44:10.84 --> 01:44:18.92
the team and they did a board with the senior people in each department.

2258
01:44:18.92 --> 01:44:23.72
But man, the training that the guys get now, the training that you got, this centralized

2259
01:44:23.72 --> 01:44:28.000
training with all the experience, all consolidated, it's awesome.

2260
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000
There's no doubt.

2261
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.76
I think they're coming out of, I don't know if they're, they might be coming out of Buds

2262
01:44:33.76 --> 01:44:34.76
now, not just SQT.

2263
01:44:34.76 --> 01:44:39.000
I think Buds with like four weeks of CQC training.

2264
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.92
Compared to you wouldn't even see it until you're at a team six months down the road

2265
01:44:42.92 --> 01:44:44.52
that you went to Shaw's for two weeks.

2266
01:44:44.52 --> 01:44:49.16
Yeah, and the thing is, like when you were talking about guys coming back from like combat

2267
01:44:49.16 --> 01:44:51.60
deployments and getting in there, and that's cool, right?

2268
01:44:51.60 --> 01:44:52.60
That's awesome.

2269
01:44:52.60 --> 01:45:00.000
But imagine like it turned into, hey, these guys were in sustained combat operations for

2270
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
years.

2271
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:07.32
Cause I remember in the nineties, like if a guy did a mission, like singular, like one

2272
01:45:07.32 --> 01:45:10.36
mission, it was like, Hey, do this guy's combat experience.

2273
01:45:10.36 --> 01:45:16.48
And like they had this thing that you didn't, you know, like I had a platoon commander who

2274
01:45:16.48 --> 01:45:22.52
was an awesome guy and he had been in Grenada and was like, you know, he had, he had slayed

2275
01:45:22.52 --> 01:45:26.20
the dragon and we were all just looking at him like, yeah, he was the coolest guy ever.

2276
01:45:26.20 --> 01:45:29.60
We had first phase instructor was on the train up in Bosnia.

2277
01:45:29.60 --> 01:45:31.12
Oh, you know, yeah.

2278
01:45:31.12 --> 01:45:35.64
I was like, there was a gunshot like, like five miles away.

2279
01:45:35.64 --> 01:45:36.64
Yeah.

2280
01:45:36.64 --> 01:45:40.84
And then he was like shooting an animal and like that was contact left.

2281
01:45:40.84 --> 01:45:42.80
You're getting debriefed on it.

2282
01:45:42.80 --> 01:45:44.16
Not judging anyone that was there.

2283
01:45:44.16 --> 01:45:47.56
Just passing, passing gouge.

2284
01:45:47.56 --> 01:45:49.92
You did what you were, what the country asked you to do.

2285
01:45:49.92 --> 01:45:53.32
So you get into a, you get, you show up at the team now, you go right into a platoon.

2286
01:45:53.32 --> 01:45:54.32
Is that the right phone now?

2287
01:45:54.32 --> 01:45:55.32
Right into a platoon.

2288
01:45:55.32 --> 01:45:56.32
Yeah.

2289
01:45:56.32 --> 01:45:57.32
What's your job?

2290
01:45:57.32 --> 01:45:58.32
Did you just get handed a 60 or what?

2291
01:45:58.32 --> 01:45:59.32
How did you guess?

2292
01:45:59.32 --> 01:46:04.60
You didn't think I'd be like the comms guy or, I got handed a 60 just cause I couldn't

2293
01:46:04.60 --> 01:46:08.52
wait as I give me to please, um, I couldn't wait to be a 60 on it actually.

2294
01:46:08.52 --> 01:46:10.52
Did you get a mark 48 or did you get a 60?

2295
01:46:10.52 --> 01:46:11.52
I guess 60 sweet.

2296
01:46:11.52 --> 01:46:12.52
Yeah.

2297
01:46:12.52 --> 01:46:17.36
By the way, Marcus had never shot a weapon before, before going.

2298
01:46:17.36 --> 01:46:18.36
No, we didn't.

2299
01:46:18.36 --> 01:46:19.36
I didn't.

2300
01:46:19.36 --> 01:46:20.36
Yeah.

2301
01:46:20.36 --> 01:46:21.36
I mean, I was like said, I grew up.

2302
01:46:21.36 --> 01:46:22.36
Yeah.

2303
01:46:22.36 --> 01:46:23.36
I grew up playing, playing ball.

2304
01:46:23.36 --> 01:46:25.28
Well, the cool thing is no bad habits.

2305
01:46:25.28 --> 01:46:27.32
Good hand eye coordination because you were an athlete.

2306
01:46:27.32 --> 01:46:30.32
Like that's all points to you probably being a pretty good shot and everything.

2307
01:46:30.32 --> 01:46:31.88
I was, I was a better pistol shot.

2308
01:46:31.88 --> 01:46:37.60
I picked that up quickly, immediately rifle took me a while to get proficient at it.

2309
01:46:37.60 --> 01:46:42.16
And even when I went over to, to a depth group, you know, I never struggled with it, but like

2310
01:46:42.16 --> 01:46:48.28
the pistol, I was, I was a really good pistol shot and quick and faster than everybody.

2311
01:46:48.28 --> 01:46:51.20
But the rifle, like I was like middle of the road.

2312
01:46:51.20 --> 01:46:53.88
I had, I struggled with it actually early on.

2313
01:46:53.88 --> 01:46:59.64
Um, I remember out at Shaw's the, uh, with the guys out there, Ross and just coming over

2314
01:46:59.64 --> 01:47:03.56
and saying, Hey, you know, just, you know, don't, don't put your magazine on the car.

2315
01:47:03.56 --> 01:47:06.76
And like, this is a bunch of things that like, he's like, I can work on.

2316
01:47:06.76 --> 01:47:12.68
But soon as he worked like with me, you know, I went from being pretty like not good to,

2317
01:47:12.68 --> 01:47:13.68
to, to excelling.

2318
01:47:13.68 --> 01:47:17.12
Um, but it took me a while and I tell people, I was like, no, I actually had to like really

2319
01:47:17.12 --> 01:47:21.66
focus and practice and like stay late or, you know, go out to the range in the evening

2320
01:47:21.66 --> 01:47:25.000
when guys were like hanging it up because I just, there was just something not right

2321
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.28
about not being proficient at it.

2322
01:47:28.28 --> 01:47:29.28
Right.

2323
01:47:29.28 --> 01:47:31.000
Like I want to actually be good.

2324
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.60
Uh, I don't want to just hang it up and, and, and walk away.

2325
01:47:33.60 --> 01:47:40.96
So I got, I got decent at shooting a, a, a, um, you know, a rifle.

2326
01:47:40.96 --> 01:47:43.52
What year was it when you checked into team 10?

2327
01:47:43.52 --> 01:47:46.000
2002, like April.

2328
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.04
And do you, do you know where you're going on deployment?

2329
01:47:48.04 --> 01:47:49.04
No, nothing.

2330
01:47:49.04 --> 01:47:50.04
We didn't know anything yet.

2331
01:47:50.04 --> 01:47:51.64
They were, oh, cause the world was still just chaos.

2332
01:47:51.64 --> 01:47:52.64
Yeah.

2333
01:47:52.64 --> 01:47:56.76
It was chaos and new team, like they were just going through, you know, growing pains, I

2334
01:47:56.76 --> 01:47:57.76
think.

2335
01:47:57.76 --> 01:47:58.76
And so we didn't know anything.

2336
01:47:58.76 --> 01:48:03.36
And my, my first deployment actually went over to Germany and just got your UCOM on.

2337
01:48:03.36 --> 01:48:05.24
We got our UCOM on.

2338
01:48:05.24 --> 01:48:07.20
Um, yeah.

2339
01:48:07.20 --> 01:48:09.08
And that was, that was whatever.

2340
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:10.08
Right.

2341
01:48:10.08 --> 01:48:11.08
Just train more training.

2342
01:48:11.08 --> 01:48:12.08
Yeah.

2343
01:48:12.08 --> 01:48:13.32
And the frustration level is everyone just going nuts.

2344
01:48:13.32 --> 01:48:15.36
Like, oh, it's insane.

2345
01:48:15.36 --> 01:48:21.52
The people that were getting out like after, you know, soon as a platoon wouldn't go to,

2346
01:48:21.52 --> 01:48:25.60
um, you know, Iraq or Afghanistan, like guys were getting, you know, you saw it out here.

2347
01:48:25.60 --> 01:48:29.24
Guys were getting out immediately, you know, they were jumping into Blackwater and all

2348
01:48:29.24 --> 01:48:30.24
these other places.

2349
01:48:30.24 --> 01:48:31.76
Um, I saw a lot of it.

2350
01:48:31.76 --> 01:48:34.84
And the guys get out to one, one platoon because they weren't, you know, cause you'd

2351
01:48:34.84 --> 01:48:38.84
hear about like these Rangers and SF and like all these guys are going down range.

2352
01:48:38.84 --> 01:48:41.56
And you know, you're like, what, I'm fucking going to Germany to do what?

2353
01:48:41.56 --> 01:48:46.000
Like, yeah, just went to Bud's and SQT and it did a two year workup.

2354
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.36
And what is this for?

2355
01:48:47.36 --> 01:48:50.36
You told me I'm like, good, you know, maybe that was garbage.

2356
01:48:50.36 --> 01:48:51.36
Yeah.

2357
01:48:51.36 --> 01:48:54.44
And plus you had that feeling that this whole thing's going to be over like really quick.

2358
01:48:54.44 --> 01:48:57.60
And I bet if I don't get it now, if I don't get out and go work for a contractor, my

2359
01:48:57.60 --> 01:48:59.72
ancestors are just horrible.

2360
01:48:59.72 --> 01:49:02.96
Well, how are you, how are you liking the team life?

2361
01:49:02.96 --> 01:49:03.96
Amber?

2362
01:49:03.96 --> 01:49:06.52
You know, I didn't mind it.

2363
01:49:06.52 --> 01:49:12.48
I realized really early on that there was a pretty clear distinction in the wives that,

2364
01:49:12.48 --> 01:49:17.64
you know, it was probably best to keep one foot in, but don't try to, you know, jump in

2365
01:49:17.64 --> 01:49:20.56
full throttle and don't stay completely away.

2366
01:49:20.56 --> 01:49:28.08
I saw that there were women that were very angry and resentful towards their husbands.

2367
01:49:28.08 --> 01:49:32.92
And I felt like there were women that were really supportive and I always wanted to be

2368
01:49:32.92 --> 01:49:34.08
supportive.

2369
01:49:34.08 --> 01:49:40.16
I also felt like, you know, it, it was not something that I wanted to necessarily make

2370
01:49:40.16 --> 01:49:45.76
my life about, but I wanted to support Marcus enough that I knew what was going on within

2371
01:49:45.76 --> 01:49:46.76
the community.

2372
01:49:46.76 --> 01:49:47.76
And so it was good.

2373
01:49:47.76 --> 01:49:49.80
And you know, we had two kids at that point.

2374
01:49:49.80 --> 01:49:56.56
I had, yeah, I got pregnant with our daughter when Marcus was in, was December of 2001, right

2375
01:49:56.56 --> 01:49:58.04
after 9-11.

2376
01:49:58.04 --> 01:50:03.28
So we had two kids when he checked into his first platoon and he was pretty much gone

2377
01:50:03.28 --> 01:50:04.28
all the time.

2378
01:50:04.28 --> 01:50:05.28
Yeah.

2379
01:50:05.28 --> 01:50:12.32
So, no, no, no, no, we had, no, I was at, I was at lead climber when you were like nine.

2380
01:50:12.32 --> 01:50:13.32
I was overdue.

2381
01:50:13.32 --> 01:50:16.16
You got home on my due date and then I ended up being five days overdue.

2382
01:50:16.16 --> 01:50:20.88
But, um, yeah, he was at lead climber and I'm like, can you tell them that you're having

2383
01:50:20.88 --> 01:50:24.80
a baby and he's like, no, no, I can't.

2384
01:50:24.80 --> 01:50:29.12
She's literally ready to burst and I'm like five hours away.

2385
01:50:29.12 --> 01:50:32.80
It's just like, it's such a, you know, the way, it's the way, it's the way.

2386
01:50:32.80 --> 01:50:35.92
I'm like, if you're deployed, that's one thing, but you're in West Virginia.

2387
01:50:35.92 --> 01:50:37.12
I'm in Virginia.

2388
01:50:37.12 --> 01:50:39.08
He had, you know, no cell phone.

2389
01:50:39.08 --> 01:50:40.08
There was one cell phone.

2390
01:50:40.08 --> 01:50:41.20
No, a pay phone.

2391
01:50:41.20 --> 01:50:45.000
You walk to and he would call and be like, have you had the baby yet?

2392
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.88
So he got home on my due date, but I ended up being a little overdue and, um, yeah, I

2393
01:50:48.88 --> 01:50:50.12
was just gone all the time.

2394
01:50:50.12 --> 01:50:52.16
It was really actually hard.

2395
01:50:52.16 --> 01:50:53.16
I was an only child.

2396
01:50:53.16 --> 01:50:56.000
So there was part of me that really, you know, I was raised an only child.

2397
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.84
So it was part of me that did love that independence and didn't need him around, but it did get

2398
01:51:00.84 --> 01:51:01.84
lonely.

2399
01:51:01.84 --> 01:51:06.40
And I was now with two little kids away and I was meeting wives, but it was, you know,

2400
01:51:06.40 --> 01:51:10.96
there's, there's just, there was a lot of like, I don't know what schools have your,

2401
01:51:10.96 --> 01:51:13.32
has your husband been to, what's your husband's rank?

2402
01:51:13.32 --> 01:51:18.80
I don't ever, I've never played that sort of like living through, getting validity through

2403
01:51:18.80 --> 01:51:20.56
your husband's career.

2404
01:51:20.56 --> 01:51:24.28
Marcus was always like, you know, my reputation means a lot to me.

2405
01:51:24.28 --> 01:51:28.32
And so don't ever do anything that would embarrass me in the community.

2406
01:51:28.32 --> 01:51:29.96
Like don't risk my reputation.

2407
01:51:29.96 --> 01:51:31.84
I really respected that.

2408
01:51:31.84 --> 01:51:32.84
Yeah.

2409
01:51:32.84 --> 01:51:33.84
Yeah.

2410
01:51:33.84 --> 01:51:39.12
Um, my wife was due with our first kid and my exo, who's a prior on this, the guy who's

2411
01:51:39.12 --> 01:51:40.12
an awesome guy.

2412
01:51:40.12 --> 01:51:42.88
This is at SEAL team too.

2413
01:51:42.88 --> 01:51:43.88
He's like, so when's your baby due?

2414
01:51:43.88 --> 01:51:46.76
And I was like, Oh, you know, like September or something.

2415
01:51:46.76 --> 01:51:50.32
And he's like, Oh, when are you supposed to go on deployment?

2416
01:51:50.32 --> 01:51:52.56
I'm like, uh, August something.

2417
01:51:52.56 --> 01:51:54.76
He's like, he's like, you're not going.

2418
01:51:54.76 --> 01:51:55.76
I was like, yeah, sir.

2419
01:51:55.76 --> 01:51:56.76
No, I'm going on deployment.

2420
01:51:56.76 --> 01:51:57.76
And he's like, yeah, you're not.

2421
01:51:57.76 --> 01:51:59.76
And I was like, sir, I'm definitely going on deployment.

2422
01:51:59.76 --> 01:52:01.56
Like I'm not, I'm, I'm definitely going.

2423
01:52:01.56 --> 01:52:03.12
He's like, you are definitely not going.

2424
01:52:03.12 --> 01:52:06.60
And so he literally said, Hey, you can go on deployment as soon as she has that baby.

2425
01:52:06.60 --> 01:52:07.60
And that's what I did.

2426
01:52:07.60 --> 01:52:09.64
And I missed about a week and a half of deployment.

2427
01:52:09.64 --> 01:52:17.28
He had the baby and I left the next day, which was probably, I mean, at least I was there.

2428
01:52:17.28 --> 01:52:21.80
But the attitude from me was just like, no, it's like first baby, whatever.

2429
01:52:21.80 --> 01:52:23.72
Like I got him going on deployment.

2430
01:52:23.72 --> 01:52:27.12
That's just, that's just the way it is.

2431
01:52:27.12 --> 01:52:31.44
I mean, so like for you to be like, no, you know, I'm not coming home.

2432
01:52:31.44 --> 01:52:34.28
I'm at, I'm at a school right now and I'm not coming home.

2433
01:52:34.28 --> 01:52:35.28
That's the way it is.

2434
01:52:35.28 --> 01:52:37.60
Like it's just the, the normal thing.

2435
01:52:37.60 --> 01:52:44.36
And then I remember I, I told my wife, God bless her.

2436
01:52:44.36 --> 01:52:51.24
She called me at work and I don't, I don't, I forget what was going on, but she called

2437
01:52:51.24 --> 01:52:57.44
me at work and my chief was like, Hey, John, call your wife's on the phone.

2438
01:52:57.44 --> 01:53:00.56
And I remember I pick up the phone and I go, what?

2439
01:53:00.56 --> 01:53:05.88
And you could tell she was like so apologetic because it's this, I put, probably put the

2440
01:53:05.88 --> 01:53:09.76
same freaking psycho pressure on my wife that, that Marcus put on you.

2441
01:53:09.76 --> 01:53:12.08
Like, don't, you know, don't mess.

2442
01:53:12.08 --> 01:53:14.76
Don't embarrass you.

2443
01:53:14.76 --> 01:53:16.04
And so I was like, what?

2444
01:53:16.04 --> 01:53:18.80
And she's like, you know, and I go, okay.

2445
01:53:18.80 --> 01:53:19.80
And that was it.

2446
01:53:19.80 --> 01:53:21.52
Like hung up, like a total jerk.

2447
01:53:21.52 --> 01:53:23.32
I'm a total savage.

2448
01:53:23.32 --> 01:53:26.000
So I'm sorry darling about that.

2449
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.12
But what I'm saying is like, that's just the normal thing.

2450
01:53:29.12 --> 01:53:31.12
Like you, you just, you're in the team.

2451
01:53:31.12 --> 01:53:32.88
You all about the team.

2452
01:53:32.88 --> 01:53:34.52
Everything's the teams.

2453
01:53:34.52 --> 01:53:38.80
And it sucks to be married to those dudes, I think in a lot of way.

2454
01:53:38.80 --> 01:53:39.80
It does.

2455
01:53:39.80 --> 01:53:44.44
But there was also the shared sort of like aggression, if you will, for lack of a better

2456
01:53:44.44 --> 01:53:48.16
term that I understood that he needed to be so focused.

2457
01:53:48.16 --> 01:53:52.56
And I was just pissed after the, the attacks of 9 11.

2458
01:53:52.56 --> 01:53:56.56
And I just thought like, yeah, get over there and like do whatever you do.

2459
01:53:56.56 --> 01:53:57.56
But, oh yeah.

2460
01:53:57.56 --> 01:53:58.56
Yeah.

2461
01:53:58.56 --> 01:53:59.56
Go do it.

2462
01:53:59.56 --> 01:54:00.56
Just I don't want to know about it, but go do it.

2463
01:54:00.56 --> 01:54:04.88
Like I knew that the teams always came first and I accepted that because I knew that it

2464
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:12.24
was a short period of our lives and it needed to be done.

2465
01:54:12.24 --> 01:54:15.88
So your first deployment, you go to, go to Germany.

2466
01:54:15.88 --> 01:54:16.88
You're sitting over there.

2467
01:54:16.88 --> 01:54:18.32
So why the hell are we doing this?

2468
01:54:18.32 --> 01:54:21.32
You get back and you roll into another platoon.

2469
01:54:21.32 --> 01:54:23.84
What's, are you going to be a 60 gunner again?

2470
01:54:23.84 --> 01:54:24.84
What's up?

2471
01:54:24.84 --> 01:54:25.84
Absolutely.

2472
01:54:25.84 --> 01:54:26.84
I asked for it.

2473
01:54:26.84 --> 01:54:31.28
But I think at that time, then we were, I was carrying a mark, I was carrying a 48.

2474
01:54:31.28 --> 01:54:32.28
Got that mark 48.

2475
01:54:32.28 --> 01:54:33.28
Nice.

2476
01:54:33.28 --> 01:54:34.28
46 too.

2477
01:54:34.28 --> 01:54:35.28
Yeah.

2478
01:54:35.28 --> 01:54:36.28
So that was good.

2479
01:54:36.28 --> 01:54:40.40
We, you know, that was my, my task unit was, was redling.

2480
01:54:40.40 --> 01:54:45.24
So, you know, we, you know, we worked up together.

2481
01:54:45.24 --> 01:54:52.64
We flipped the coin, you know, in the previous platoon basically got to go to Afghanistan

2482
01:54:52.64 --> 01:54:53.64
first.

2483
01:54:53.64 --> 01:54:54.64
We go to Germany first.

2484
01:54:54.64 --> 01:54:59.16
Oh, so when we were ripping out like halfway through to get guys more exposure.

2485
01:54:59.16 --> 01:55:00.16
Yep.

2486
01:55:00.16 --> 01:55:05.40
So literally over a coin toss and so those guys went down range and we went to, you know,

2487
01:55:05.40 --> 01:55:10.000
we went to Germany and then, you know, the rest is kind of history.

2488
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.60
And once the Hilo went down, we actually deployed a week later because, you know, they were

2489
01:55:14.60 --> 01:55:15.60
a wreck.

2490
01:55:15.60 --> 01:55:16.60
They were a wreck.

2491
01:55:16.60 --> 01:55:21.48
I mean, half the, half the two was gone and the other guys were, you know, not good.

2492
01:55:21.48 --> 01:55:23.72
How do you, how do you guys get word?

2493
01:55:23.72 --> 01:55:24.72
What are you guys doing?

2494
01:55:24.72 --> 01:55:26.96
It was terrible how we got word.

2495
01:55:26.96 --> 01:55:29.32
We actually got word from, from them.

2496
01:55:29.32 --> 01:55:30.32
So here we are.

2497
01:55:30.32 --> 01:55:34.000
We're forward deployed in Germany, actually a unit.

2498
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:45.12
And we got to find out from our spouses that there's guys in full military dress showing

2499
01:55:45.12 --> 01:55:46.64
up at people's doors.

2500
01:55:46.64 --> 01:55:48.16
Like that's how we found out.

2501
01:55:48.16 --> 01:55:51.52
So it was, that was a rough couple of days.

2502
01:55:51.52 --> 01:55:52.52
It went on though.

2503
01:55:52.52 --> 01:55:56.96
And the communication wasn't a whole lot better back in Virginia Beach because they

2504
01:55:56.96 --> 01:55:58.36
were still searching for Marcus LaTrell.

2505
01:55:58.36 --> 01:56:02.72
And you know, that went on for like what almost a week.

2506
01:56:02.72 --> 01:56:07.72
And you know, no one knew if their husband was on the helicopter or not.

2507
01:56:07.72 --> 01:56:10.000
And the ones that survived weren't allowed to call home.

2508
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000
And so it was literally pins and needles and they weren't hearing much more.

2509
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.60
But then when the Knox started coming, they were finding out.

2510
01:56:20.60 --> 01:56:25.52
Yeah, I remember being on the phone with you and you like screaming crying because like

2511
01:56:25.52 --> 01:56:28.36
somebody was like somebody showed up to the door.

2512
01:56:28.36 --> 01:56:30.44
Like they were all, you know, when we were together and stuff.

2513
01:56:30.44 --> 01:56:34.24
So it was, that was like a just a shitty, you know, just a shitty time, I think for

2514
01:56:34.24 --> 01:56:35.68
everybody in the community.

2515
01:56:35.68 --> 01:56:40.16
As you know, didn't really, didn't experience a loss like that.

2516
01:56:40.16 --> 01:56:44.48
So it was really difficult how people were handling it.

2517
01:56:44.48 --> 01:56:49.32
When those guys got back to Germany, I think they flew in a psych to like meet with everybody

2518
01:56:49.32 --> 01:56:50.80
for 30 minutes.

2519
01:56:50.80 --> 01:56:54.08
First guy went in there and didn't come out for almost three hours.

2520
01:56:54.08 --> 01:56:56.60
So they were, they were trying, they were going to, they gave each guy 30 minutes to

2521
01:56:56.60 --> 01:56:57.60
talk to psych.

2522
01:56:57.60 --> 01:56:59.24
And the first guy went in and come out for three hours.

2523
01:56:59.24 --> 01:57:03.40
So it was just one of those things that I don't think anybody even knew how to prepare

2524
01:57:03.40 --> 01:57:04.40
or what to do.

2525
01:57:04.40 --> 01:57:07.16
And so it was just a bit, you know, it was a bit rough for a while.

2526
01:57:07.16 --> 01:57:14.000
But again, once we got like over that week, got our heads back straight, we were like,

2527
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.84
get us over there yesterday.

2528
01:57:15.84 --> 01:57:17.44
Like, why are we still sitting here?

2529
01:57:17.44 --> 01:57:18.44
But we did.

2530
01:57:18.44 --> 01:57:21.24
And within a week, we were in country and we were already, we were doing our first mission

2531
01:57:21.24 --> 01:57:22.88
like within the first couple of days.

2532
01:57:22.88 --> 01:57:23.88
So.

2533
01:57:23.88 --> 01:57:24.88
And then what were you guys doing?

2534
01:57:24.88 --> 01:57:25.88
What was like your mission set?

2535
01:57:25.88 --> 01:57:30.40
Mission was going after different like, like different cells, different Taliban cells that

2536
01:57:30.40 --> 01:57:35.60
were, but like larger, it was almost like a little bit different.

2537
01:57:35.60 --> 01:57:38.56
Wasn't like CT missions, even though we did like a CT op, right?

2538
01:57:38.56 --> 01:57:43.20
Like initially the first stop was like a no shit, like it's probably the coolest op ever.

2539
01:57:43.20 --> 01:57:48.88
Like, you know, black hawks come in, ropes go out, you know, fast rope, you know, charge

2540
01:57:48.88 --> 01:57:52.76
on the gate, like boom, everybody, you know, like it was like a real op.

2541
01:57:52.76 --> 01:57:58.04
And then because that was done at night, it got shut down and the whole country then got

2542
01:57:58.04 --> 01:58:02.88
shut down because you're not allowed to go after bad guys at night because that's not

2543
01:58:02.88 --> 01:58:05.80
nice.

2544
01:58:05.80 --> 01:58:09.76
So that's what we were dealing with in, in, you know, in Afghanistan at the time.

2545
01:58:09.76 --> 01:58:17.04
So then we started just, you know, going out to in the daytime chasing different, different

2546
01:58:17.04 --> 01:58:21.36
groups like in valleys and we were working with the Kansafs or the Canadians who were

2547
01:58:21.36 --> 01:58:23.52
like men compared to us.

2548
01:58:23.52 --> 01:58:27.12
They were like, they look like Vikings, but they wore way too much gear.

2549
01:58:27.12 --> 01:58:30.32
And we had to tell them to like, like, dude, you're going out in the mountain for three

2550
01:58:30.32 --> 01:58:33.88
days and you got six, nine mil mags on your body.

2551
01:58:33.88 --> 01:58:35.96
Do you think you're going to use six, nine mil mags?

2552
01:58:35.96 --> 01:58:38.60
I really hope you don't need to use six, nine mil mags.

2553
01:58:38.60 --> 01:58:39.84
So, you know, shit like that.

2554
01:58:39.84 --> 01:58:42.48
But, but so that's what we were doing.

2555
01:58:42.48 --> 01:58:45.76
And what's your job in the platoon?

2556
01:58:45.76 --> 01:58:48.72
I was a Air Ops lead breacher.

2557
01:58:48.72 --> 01:58:53.32
And so I, you know, in a fire team later.

2558
01:58:53.32 --> 01:58:59.12
And yeah, it got, we had a good, like I would say good, good deployment.

2559
01:58:59.12 --> 01:59:01.72
It was a really spicy deployment.

2560
01:59:01.72 --> 01:59:06.04
I mean, we had like multiple engagements.

2561
01:59:06.04 --> 01:59:15.56
We had our chief got, we got lit up by a army Apache, which was wild because like that

2562
01:59:15.56 --> 01:59:17.56
was not supposed to, obviously it wasn't supposed to happen.

2563
01:59:17.56 --> 01:59:22.20
It was a big deal because it was, it was daytime.

2564
01:59:22.20 --> 01:59:28.24
Still don't know how they didn't recognize us full on engagement, like full on gun run,

2565
01:59:28.24 --> 01:59:33.72
not just like, oh, there might be a position of more, like we were, we were engaging a

2566
01:59:33.72 --> 01:59:36.76
small group that was engaging us.

2567
01:59:36.76 --> 01:59:40.64
And we were, it was like five of us and maybe three of them.

2568
01:59:40.64 --> 01:59:44.68
And we were starting to bound forward, like from cover to cover.

2569
01:59:44.68 --> 01:59:48.32
And you know, I actually, I was a patrolman with a, with a saw.

2570
01:59:48.32 --> 01:59:49.64
So it was a little bit lighter.

2571
01:59:49.64 --> 01:59:53.16
And I just remember just like, just fucking going off on that thing.

2572
01:59:53.16 --> 01:59:55.16
It was awesome.

2573
01:59:55.16 --> 02:00:04.12
And then I remember hearing this deep, like deep, deep sound of just like, doot, doot,

2574
02:00:04.12 --> 02:00:05.12
doot, doot, doot.

2575
02:00:05.12 --> 02:00:06.76
I'm like, what the fuck is that?

2576
02:00:06.76 --> 02:00:11.32
And literally in the middle of this little valley, and it was, it was not wide, I turn

2577
02:00:11.32 --> 02:00:20.64
around and this army, this Apache is in a full on like front till gun run.

2578
02:00:20.64 --> 02:00:22.20
And I literally thought it was a movie.

2579
02:00:22.20 --> 02:00:28.16
Like you saw like the dirt and the, you know, whatever there was a 20 millimeter maybe.

2580
02:00:28.16 --> 02:00:30.32
It was just coming straight at me.

2581
02:00:30.32 --> 02:00:32.48
And I'm like, you know, all this happened so fast.

2582
02:00:32.48 --> 02:00:34.36
I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

2583
02:00:34.36 --> 02:00:37.24
Like we're getting engaged by our own guys.

2584
02:00:37.24 --> 02:00:40.20
And so it's come, it's tearing ass.

2585
02:00:40.20 --> 02:00:41.20
We all dive out of the way.

2586
02:00:41.20 --> 02:00:47.64
I remember diving behind rocks and watching my chief do a full on like dive, like into

2587
02:00:47.64 --> 02:00:50.56
rocks, like did not give a fuck.

2588
02:00:50.56 --> 02:00:53.08
And the thing comes tearing through.

2589
02:00:53.08 --> 02:00:55.20
You can't see anything because dust everywhere.

2590
02:00:55.20 --> 02:00:56.72
He wound up getting hit in the face.

2591
02:00:56.72 --> 02:01:03.76
Well, the way they were working gun runs then is that dash one would come in and do 20 millimeter

2592
02:01:03.76 --> 02:01:07.08
guns, you know what dash two is coming in with next, right?

2593
02:01:07.08 --> 02:01:09.76
2.5 rockets.

2594
02:01:09.76 --> 02:01:14.76
And so I just get this rock and I just huddle up and I'm like, this is fucking it.

2595
02:01:14.76 --> 02:01:17.08
Like I may live, but like I'm going to get fucked up.

2596
02:01:17.08 --> 02:01:21.56
I'm going to get fracked here because like we've been calling in gun runs all day long

2597
02:01:21.56 --> 02:01:24.96
into caves and like we get, we get engaged.

2598
02:01:24.96 --> 02:01:27.88
We pull back, calling some guns, move forward.

2599
02:01:27.88 --> 02:01:30.68
That's what kind of mission it was through the mountains there.

2600
02:01:30.68 --> 02:01:31.68
And so I was just waiting.

2601
02:01:31.68 --> 02:01:32.96
I was like huddled up and like, oh, this is it.

2602
02:01:32.96 --> 02:01:34.80
We're going to get, I'm going to get sprayed.

2603
02:01:34.80 --> 02:01:35.80
Hopefully it's not bad.

2604
02:01:35.80 --> 02:01:39.76
Like I was like trying to cover up my face thinking like, okay, if I just get wounded,

2605
02:01:39.76 --> 02:01:43.12
you know, it'll be okay, but just not my face or my head.

2606
02:01:43.12 --> 02:01:46.12
And the second one just comes tearing through and doesn't fire anything.

2607
02:01:46.12 --> 02:01:47.28
But I could see them.

2608
02:01:47.28 --> 02:01:50.32
I could literally see them and they were so low.

2609
02:01:50.32 --> 02:01:55.76
So somebody who, who didn't have their head up their ass was able to move over to fires

2610
02:01:55.76 --> 02:01:57.68
and call it off.

2611
02:01:57.68 --> 02:01:58.68
Somebody cleared them hot.

2612
02:01:58.68 --> 02:02:03.60
I still don't know to this day and we still talk about it because like it was a fuck up.

2613
02:02:03.60 --> 02:02:04.96
You know, it was a bad fuck up.

2614
02:02:04.96 --> 02:02:06.68
How bad was your chief wounded?

2615
02:02:06.68 --> 02:02:12.12
He his whole face was like, um, like you couldn't, it wasn't bad, bad, like, but it was like,

2616
02:02:12.12 --> 02:02:17.12
if you took a picture, you almost unrecognizable because the, I guess the frag going that fast

2617
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:18.84
was so fast.

2618
02:02:18.84 --> 02:02:23.68
It just kind of blew his face up and he was like, like spit in blood a little bit, but

2619
02:02:23.68 --> 02:02:25.000
he honestly was fine.

2620
02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Yeah.

2621
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Yeah.

2622
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Like let's be real.

2623
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Yeah.

2624
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Yeah.

2625
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Yeah.

2626
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Yeah.

2627
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Yeah.

2628
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Oh, 100%.

2629
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Like, you know, looking back, you're like, but, um, yeah, that was a big deal.

2630
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.72
I just remember, I think when we got back and again, I was a E, but I think E five at

2631
02:02:37.72 --> 02:02:41.68
the time, maybe six, you know, so I was, I was tucked away, but I think the leadership

2632
02:02:41.68 --> 02:02:48.88
got in the ass of, of that unit, you know, over it, um, over at C. just so it was like,

2633
02:02:48.88 --> 02:02:49.88
what, what happened there?

2634
02:02:49.88 --> 02:02:53.16
You know, who caught first of who, who cleared them hot?

2635
02:02:53.16 --> 02:02:54.16
You know, we were on the offensive.

2636
02:02:54.16 --> 02:02:56.32
It was just a, it was a total mess.

2637
02:02:56.32 --> 02:03:00.64
When I was a young radio man, I was standing out in the desert in Fallon, Nevada, trying

2638
02:03:00.64 --> 02:03:04.92
to call in for an extract from a helicopter to helicopters.

2639
02:03:04.92 --> 02:03:09.000
And I'm sitting there and I'm looking, they're, they're like, maybe a couple hundred feet

2640
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.08
at altitude and I, I'm just standing there making columns of them.

2641
02:03:13.08 --> 02:03:16.88
Like, Hey, you know, we're ready for extract and they couldn't see me.

2642
02:03:16.88 --> 02:03:17.88
And I was like, this is crazy.

2643
02:03:17.88 --> 02:03:19.04
I started like waving my arms.

2644
02:03:19.04 --> 02:03:20.04
They still can't see me.

2645
02:03:20.04 --> 02:03:24.16
And finally, uh, you know, I'm like, I'm getting a bearing and I'm like, Hey, I'm right over

2646
02:03:24.16 --> 02:03:26.68
here to your Southwest and they just can't see me.

2647
02:03:26.68 --> 02:03:30.64
And finally I like pop or whatever, pop of smoke and I mark you identifying, blah, blah,

2648
02:03:30.64 --> 02:03:31.64
blah.

2649
02:03:31.64 --> 02:03:37.16
But it showed me that when you're in the air, like things just look so totally different

2650
02:03:37.16 --> 02:03:44.20
and, uh, they can't see shit and they're moving freaking 150 miles an hour.

2651
02:03:44.20 --> 02:03:46.60
And they get told like, you're cleared hot.

2652
02:03:46.60 --> 02:03:47.60
Guess what?

2653
02:03:47.60 --> 02:03:48.84
They're going to freaking shoot, man.

2654
02:03:48.84 --> 02:03:50.92
Um, cause a lot of times they're saving your ass.

2655
02:03:50.92 --> 02:03:52.56
They're saving someone's ass too.

2656
02:03:52.56 --> 02:03:53.56
Yeah.

2657
02:03:53.56 --> 02:03:56.48
And you know, there's like, I mean, you know, all the blue and blue that was happening just

2658
02:03:56.48 --> 02:03:57.48
everywhere.

2659
02:03:57.48 --> 02:03:59.68
And again, it's not, you know, of course it's not nefarious.

2660
02:03:59.68 --> 02:04:01.84
It just, it happens just like that.

2661
02:04:01.84 --> 02:04:02.84
Yeah.

2662
02:04:02.84 --> 02:04:07.12
Um, but we had, uh, as I'm sure, you know, you did, uh, we were in day, you know, day

2663
02:04:07.12 --> 02:04:12.16
panels and I popped out immediately and they were like, are you fucking kidding me guys?

2664
02:04:12.16 --> 02:04:15.76
Like we can't see a day panel that's cut up out of your shoulder.

2665
02:04:15.76 --> 02:04:18.76
So like the lesson learned that day forward was like, no, no, you got to carry a full

2666
02:04:18.76 --> 02:04:21.32
day panel and like busted out.

2667
02:04:21.32 --> 02:04:24.24
And you know, because that's the only thing that you said, that's the only thing we can

2668
02:04:24.24 --> 02:04:25.24
see.

2669
02:04:25.24 --> 02:04:27.88
There's no way we can see that little thing on your shoulder.

2670
02:04:27.88 --> 02:04:32.36
You know, so, uh, incredible lessons learned.

2671
02:04:32.36 --> 02:04:36.40
Um, and, and so that, that deployment wraps up.

2672
02:04:36.40 --> 02:04:42.16
Um, but I mean, you lost freaking so many guys from your task.

2673
02:04:42.16 --> 02:04:43.16
Good guys.

2674
02:04:43.16 --> 02:04:44.16
Yeah.

2675
02:04:44.16 --> 02:04:46.32
Couple of buds mates and yeah, it was wild.

2676
02:04:46.32 --> 02:04:51.08
I mean, matter of fact, right before we deployed right after the healer, well, not right after

2677
02:04:51.08 --> 02:04:57.36
the healer went down, but they flew, Marcus flew back to Germany and they were like, Hey,

2678
02:04:57.36 --> 02:05:03.92
you and so and so get up to, uh, I forgot it was Ramstein, like go meet him.

2679
02:05:03.92 --> 02:05:05.88
Like he's fucked right now.

2680
02:05:05.88 --> 02:05:10.72
So we, we, we got in a car went up there, met him like once he, I think they, they'd

2681
02:05:10.72 --> 02:05:16.32
cleaned him up once he got out of like the, you know, the, um, the ER or whatever, but

2682
02:05:16.32 --> 02:05:18.28
he was covered in, he was nasty looking.

2683
02:05:18.28 --> 02:05:24.64
I used like, it looked like he, his, the, all the, the wounds he had were just like,

2684
02:05:24.64 --> 02:05:25.64
just healing.

2685
02:05:25.64 --> 02:05:27.44
So like his face was covered in shit.

2686
02:05:27.44 --> 02:05:32.68
All his arms and legs were like covered in like, he looked horrible, but he was like

2687
02:05:32.68 --> 02:05:37.72
super excited to see us because he was, you know, he thought he was going to get his head

2688
02:05:37.72 --> 02:05:38.72
cut off for it.

2689
02:05:38.72 --> 02:05:44.24
I was, uh, I was the admiral's aid and I was just about done with that job.

2690
02:05:44.24 --> 02:05:46.92
So I'd come back from Iraq and I, I became the admiral's aid.

2691
02:05:46.92 --> 02:05:54.56
And so when that was happening, I was tracking what was happening and I remember they're

2692
02:05:54.56 --> 02:06:02.60
like, like they're telling the admiral, Hey, it seems like there's a guy that's alive.

2693
02:06:02.60 --> 02:06:04.88
And I was, like I said, I was a radio man.

2694
02:06:04.88 --> 02:06:08.000
So I was like, bro, they're like, they have, they have his radio.

2695
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.84
Like this is in my, I didn't say this verbally, but I was thinking to myself, man, they have

2696
02:06:12.84 --> 02:06:16.84
his radio and they've turned his radio on and they turned on the transponder or whatever.

2697
02:06:16.84 --> 02:06:18.32
You know, how is a guy alive right now?

2698
02:06:18.32 --> 02:06:20.04
It didn't make any sense.

2699
02:06:20.04 --> 02:06:23.84
And then by the next day it was like, no, they have actually have comms.

2700
02:06:23.84 --> 02:06:26.40
And I remember thinking, this is a freaking miracle.

2701
02:06:26.40 --> 02:06:30.56
Um, how this, if this guy's alive for real.

2702
02:06:30.56 --> 02:06:39.84
And the weird thing was I, I had met the Latrell boys at a West coast reunion.

2703
02:06:39.84 --> 02:06:44.20
And I just saw them, but I remember because they were big giant monster guys and they're

2704
02:06:44.20 --> 02:06:45.20
twins, right?

2705
02:06:45.20 --> 02:06:48.52
Which is, they just stand out corn fed Texas, Texas.

2706
02:06:48.52 --> 02:06:52.44
And I remember like seeing them and being like, damn, that's freaking legit.

2707
02:06:52.44 --> 02:06:55.24
You got your twin brother and you're both in the deep.

2708
02:06:55.24 --> 02:06:56.44
It's like, how cool is that?

2709
02:06:56.44 --> 02:06:59.80
And then sure enough, as I put the piece together, it's like, Oh shit, it's that guy.

2710
02:06:59.80 --> 02:07:01.68
It's one of those two guys.

2711
02:07:01.68 --> 02:07:08.04
Uh, and man, that was horrible, horrible scenario.

2712
02:07:08.04 --> 02:07:14.20
Um, I remember thinking at that time, A, this is definitely going to be made into a film

2713
02:07:14.20 --> 02:07:17.04
because the story was just unbelievable.

2714
02:07:17.04 --> 02:07:21.56
And B, oh shit, like bad things can happen to team guys.

2715
02:07:21.56 --> 02:07:25.64
Like, you know, you'd heard of like a death or two, a training accident or, you know,

2716
02:07:25.64 --> 02:07:30.88
someone died overseas, but until that helicopter went down, I sort of thought team guys were

2717
02:07:30.88 --> 02:07:32.48
invincible.

2718
02:07:32.48 --> 02:07:36.20
And for the first time, I remember thinking like, Oh shit.

2719
02:07:36.20 --> 02:07:40.44
Um, this might not end well.

2720
02:07:40.44 --> 02:07:46.80
And you know, you see someone of your girlfriends suddenly become widows and got real, really

2721
02:07:46.80 --> 02:07:47.80
quick.

2722
02:07:47.80 --> 02:07:51.68
So what'd you do when you got home from that deployment?

2723
02:07:51.68 --> 02:07:53.68
We had a huge party.

2724
02:07:53.68 --> 02:07:57.20
We had a big party, invited everybody, including the CEO.

2725
02:07:57.20 --> 02:08:00.12
And I think, um, to this day, we still talk about that.

2726
02:08:00.12 --> 02:08:01.36
Amber bought me a Keggerator.

2727
02:08:01.36 --> 02:08:03.36
She was kind of celebrating us coming back.

2728
02:08:03.36 --> 02:08:07.96
And you know, a few people were not happy at that because of that, you know, because

2729
02:08:07.96 --> 02:08:09.92
of the healer coming down and guys didn't come home.

2730
02:08:09.92 --> 02:08:14.04
And I think those were all our like brothers and friends and sisters.

2731
02:08:14.04 --> 02:08:19.68
And, uh, we, you know, Amber's thought was, Hey, I just want to celebrate like that guys

2732
02:08:19.68 --> 02:08:23.40
came back, you know, and so we threw a party and she bought me a Keggerator.

2733
02:08:23.40 --> 02:08:25.000
I think from Costco.

2734
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.90
And that was really cool because I had just all of a sudden I gained like a hundred friends

2735
02:08:27.90 --> 02:08:28.90
overnight.

2736
02:08:28.90 --> 02:08:31.40
Like guys would just stop by and be like, Hey, I'm just grabbing a beer.

2737
02:08:31.40 --> 02:08:33.40
How do you Keggerator?

2738
02:08:33.40 --> 02:08:37.12
Um, but I think that night Amber had the CEO's stop.

2739
02:08:37.12 --> 02:08:38.12
Don't even say it.

2740
02:08:38.12 --> 02:08:39.12
No, it's great.

2741
02:08:39.12 --> 02:08:43.60
She had the, she had the CEO's wife doing a Keggerator, but I had her like legs up

2742
02:08:43.60 --> 02:08:44.60
in the air.

2743
02:08:44.60 --> 02:08:46.52
She got thrown into that and in her defense.

2744
02:08:46.52 --> 02:08:49.12
It was great, but it's still a good story.

2745
02:08:49.12 --> 02:08:50.36
I think it was E five at the time.

2746
02:08:50.36 --> 02:08:51.36
She's great.

2747
02:08:51.36 --> 02:08:52.36
And he's great.

2748
02:08:52.36 --> 02:08:53.36
They're amazing.

2749
02:08:53.36 --> 02:08:55.40
Uh, what about career?

2750
02:08:55.40 --> 02:08:56.64
What do you, what are you doing now?

2751
02:08:56.64 --> 02:08:58.48
What's your next move from there?

2752
02:08:58.48 --> 02:08:59.48
Yeah.

2753
02:08:59.48 --> 02:09:01.76
So, uh, come back for my second deployment.

2754
02:09:01.76 --> 02:09:07.96
Uh, I'd already screened for after my first and they just said, Hey, uh, we're not taking

2755
02:09:07.96 --> 02:09:10.12
anybody after one platoon.

2756
02:09:10.12 --> 02:09:11.68
So good, you know, you're good.

2757
02:09:11.68 --> 02:09:15.04
Go, go do one deployment and come back and you'll be in that next class.

2758
02:09:15.04 --> 02:09:19.76
I was in 06 and, and you're rolling to that selection.

2759
02:09:19.76 --> 02:09:20.76
How was that?

2760
02:09:20.76 --> 02:09:21.76
It was good.

2761
02:09:21.76 --> 02:09:23.92
Um, again, just full focus.

2762
02:09:23.92 --> 02:09:29.12
Um, you know, I, you know, to my surprise guys didn't practice, but like, I just wanted

2763
02:09:29.12 --> 02:09:30.12
to be there.

2764
02:09:30.12 --> 02:09:34.36
Like I wanted to be just, you know, when I found out about that place, I was like, yeah,

2765
02:09:34.36 --> 02:09:35.36
that's exactly what I want to do.

2766
02:09:35.36 --> 02:09:42.96
So I trained and worked hard and, um, yeah, I just had a good CQC block and like I was

2767
02:09:42.96 --> 02:09:47.80
saying, you know, like, like was one of the, I was the top like pistol shooter and with

2768
02:09:47.80 --> 02:09:49.64
the right, that's where I was like struggling with the rifle.

2769
02:09:49.64 --> 02:09:53.24
And I went from like, they post your scores every day, your time, there's no hiding.

2770
02:09:53.24 --> 02:09:57.84
Like, like when you shoot, like you show up and you're like, Oh, Marcus 57 out of 60,

2771
02:09:57.84 --> 02:09:58.84
like what?

2772
02:09:58.84 --> 02:10:00.36
And it was like, Oh, look at shit bag.

2773
02:10:00.36 --> 02:10:03.20
Like, if you don't move up, you're out of here.

2774
02:10:03.20 --> 02:10:04.20
Right.

2775
02:10:04.20 --> 02:10:08.08
And so, um, I wasn't like in the pistol, pistol was at the top, but the rifle, the initial

2776
02:10:08.08 --> 02:10:10.08
week I was really close to the bottom.

2777
02:10:10.08 --> 02:10:14.04
And I'm like, dude, this is not like, I can't, that's so weird.

2778
02:10:14.04 --> 02:10:15.52
I can't, it was weird.

2779
02:10:15.52 --> 02:10:18.52
And then it's good at pistol and not good at rifles.

2780
02:10:18.52 --> 02:10:19.52
Just weird.

2781
02:10:19.52 --> 02:10:22.12
And was there something that didn't click in your head and then some, something finally

2782
02:10:22.12 --> 02:10:23.12
made a click?

2783
02:10:23.12 --> 02:10:28.32
Jaco, I'm still trying to figure out what's fucking in my head.

2784
02:10:28.32 --> 02:10:29.32
I don't know.

2785
02:10:29.32 --> 02:10:35.88
I, I, man, I wish I could, I could say, but I managed to crawl my way back into the top

2786
02:10:35.88 --> 02:10:42.28
10 just by like sheer, you know, have to as you would respect that.

2787
02:10:42.28 --> 02:10:47.60
Like I just had to get, I had to get good and I got, I got a lot better.

2788
02:10:47.60 --> 02:10:50.36
So, but no, I, I did really well.

2789
02:10:50.36 --> 02:10:55.12
Um, I finished that and kind of finished green team and, and, you know, they kind of do a

2790
02:10:55.12 --> 02:10:59.96
ranking and, um, you know, you're not supposed to know, but I was, I guess I was chosen first.

2791
02:10:59.96 --> 02:11:05.32
Um, and I went over to squadron, hung out with our, got to work for our bro that I talked

2792
02:11:05.32 --> 02:11:06.32
about earlier.

2793
02:11:06.32 --> 02:11:10.84
I don't know if you care if we say his name on here or what, but I say, don't say his name.

2794
02:11:10.84 --> 02:11:11.84
Okay.

2795
02:11:11.84 --> 02:11:12.84
Yeah.

2796
02:11:12.84 --> 02:11:17.44
Um, but yeah, it was, uh, everything, everything that I thought.

2797
02:11:17.44 --> 02:11:23.64
Uh, probably actually more and, and a lot of stuff that I didn't expect, um, for sure.

2798
02:11:23.64 --> 02:11:29.64
And probably Amber will tell you, like life just got weird or after that.

2799
02:11:29.64 --> 02:11:31.64
So now you start knocking out deployments.

2800
02:11:31.64 --> 02:11:34.60
Um, what's the cycle that you run every year?

2801
02:11:34.60 --> 02:11:35.60
So we were deploying every year.

2802
02:11:35.60 --> 02:11:41.28
Sometimes twice now, but at the time it was six on and then three, six on.

2803
02:11:41.28 --> 02:11:42.28
It was three.

2804
02:11:42.28 --> 02:11:43.28
Yeah.

2805
02:11:43.28 --> 02:11:45.48
Three month deployment, six, six back.

2806
02:11:45.48 --> 02:11:46.48
Yeah.

2807
02:11:46.48 --> 02:11:51.04
Three training, three on standby, three gone, three training.

2808
02:11:51.04 --> 02:11:53.56
And then on standby, you know, flyways.

2809
02:11:53.56 --> 02:12:02.72
Um, and, um, it was good again, but I was away way more than even, um, and even at the

2810
02:12:02.72 --> 02:12:12.40
teams where your deployments to, um, all side, um, you know, Bagram, um, so both Iraq and

2811
02:12:12.40 --> 02:12:14.84
Afghanistan, both OEF, OF, yep.

2812
02:12:14.84 --> 02:12:18.44
And you're bouncing back and what, what's your, um, what's your job?

2813
02:12:18.44 --> 02:12:21.56
Uh, I was also preacher there.

2814
02:12:21.56 --> 02:12:22.56
Um, yeah.

2815
02:12:22.56 --> 02:12:25.92
I mean, that's, that's exactly, that's all I did.

2816
02:12:25.92 --> 02:12:27.28
Um, I loved it.

2817
02:12:27.28 --> 02:12:29.52
And I was, um, I did a lot of the combatives.

2818
02:12:29.52 --> 02:12:35.36
So it was that split at the time where it was like sport fighters and combatives and

2819
02:12:35.36 --> 02:12:38.96
combative guys hate sport fighters and sport fighters think combative guys are gay.

2820
02:12:38.96 --> 02:12:43.20
And you know, it was like that thing going on, you know, and I thought it was funny,

2821
02:12:43.20 --> 02:12:49.48
but I do tell this story, um, because I trained every morning I went in, we had, um, you know,

2822
02:12:49.48 --> 02:12:51.44
Kuchy had his guys every day.

2823
02:12:51.44 --> 02:12:52.88
And so I'd go in for two hours and train.

2824
02:12:52.88 --> 02:12:57.76
I never trained at, at, at a gym just because we have to work.

2825
02:12:57.76 --> 02:12:58.76
I went home.

2826
02:12:58.76 --> 02:13:00.80
Um, but I did train every day.

2827
02:13:00.80 --> 02:13:04.48
And there was one day I was, um, I had a guy in a full mount and I was trying to figure

2828
02:13:04.48 --> 02:13:08.96
out a way to, to put a, like a, like a collar, like some kind of choke with it.

2829
02:13:08.96 --> 02:13:12.000
You know, and I was trying to grab his collar and then it like stopped.

2830
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.52
And I looked at him and I'm like, what the fuck are we doing?

2831
02:13:14.52 --> 02:13:15.76
Why am I trying to choke you?

2832
02:13:15.76 --> 02:13:20.36
Why aren't I like, why don't I like hitting you, put my knee on your chest, like get up

2833
02:13:20.36 --> 02:13:23.64
and go to my sidearm or pull out something and stick you with it or just like push you

2834
02:13:23.64 --> 02:13:24.64
and get away.

2835
02:13:24.64 --> 02:13:27.52
And from there I was like, you know, I'm not doing any more sport fighting.

2836
02:13:27.52 --> 02:13:32.28
I just like, I just want to know how to like just like pound, pound, pound or, you know,

2837
02:13:32.28 --> 02:13:36.40
gouge your eye out or just like stick you in the gut with a knife and just get the fuck

2838
02:13:36.40 --> 02:13:37.90
out of here.

2839
02:13:37.90 --> 02:13:42.48
And, and then like I started more of moving into the camp of like the combative side of

2840
02:13:42.48 --> 02:13:43.48
the house.

2841
02:13:43.48 --> 02:13:45.88
And then of course you had people saying, well, no, if you're a better sport fighter

2842
02:13:45.88 --> 02:13:47.76
that a transition is like the skydivers.

2843
02:13:47.76 --> 02:13:53.98
Like if you skydive slick forever, no, I could, any of those guys could strap on a heavy

2844
02:13:53.98 --> 02:13:59.76
rock and you know, so it was just anyway, it was back and forth and I digress with,

2845
02:13:59.76 --> 02:14:03.48
where are we going on that one?

2846
02:14:03.48 --> 02:14:04.48
I loved all of it.

2847
02:14:04.48 --> 02:14:05.48
How about that?

2848
02:14:05.48 --> 02:14:06.88
It was, you know, I, um, but so okay.

2849
02:14:06.88 --> 02:14:08.24
But you asked me what I was doing.

2850
02:14:08.24 --> 02:14:10.96
I was a breacher and I did, you know, I did a lot of commons stuff.

2851
02:14:10.96 --> 02:14:15.64
And I climbed and, and Amber, what's, what's life like for you now?

2852
02:14:15.64 --> 02:14:17.24
Now he's gone even more.

2853
02:14:17.24 --> 02:14:19.000
I was way more settled.

2854
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.76
So that's actually when I met, around that time is when I met Sarah Wilkinson.

2855
02:14:23.76 --> 02:14:30.08
And our life was very centered around the command and, you know, other command members,

2856
02:14:30.08 --> 02:14:35.16
command families, we all sort of, you know, worked out together, hung out together, weekends

2857
02:14:35.16 --> 02:14:40.64
together, um, with the kids, sports and pool parties and birthdays.

2858
02:14:40.64 --> 02:14:45.40
And, you know, it was, it was, um, very tight knit.

2859
02:14:45.40 --> 02:14:52.24
And one of the, one of the things that I remember so much about when Sarah was talking through,

2860
02:14:52.24 --> 02:14:59.80
you know, her experience with Chad was like, it left such an impression on me.

2861
02:14:59.80 --> 02:15:09.48
She's just talking about like this personality change that she saw from him over time.

2862
02:15:09.48 --> 02:15:15.80
And you know, it, were you seeing that kind of thing from Marcus at this point?

2863
02:15:15.80 --> 02:15:17.88
Were you seeing, was he getting withdrawn?

2864
02:15:17.88 --> 02:15:20.36
Was he, you know, short fused?

2865
02:15:20.36 --> 02:15:24.24
Was he, it's, you know, it sounded like what, what Chad was doing was more like the withdrawn

2866
02:15:24.24 --> 02:15:25.24
thing.

2867
02:15:25.24 --> 02:15:27.60
And you know, she was like, look, he wasn't like the most talkative guy in the world.

2868
02:15:27.60 --> 02:15:32.12
But all of a sudden like she noticed that he was different.

2869
02:15:32.12 --> 02:15:33.12
Yeah.

2870
02:15:33.12 --> 02:15:36.04
And then before you can go, like, and so I worked with Chad, he was one of my recce

2871
02:15:36.04 --> 02:15:41.08
guys and I never, like he was smiling, happy, joking.

2872
02:15:41.08 --> 02:15:44.96
And again, this is right when he, he showed up there.

2873
02:15:44.96 --> 02:15:45.96
Yeah.

2874
02:15:45.96 --> 02:15:46.96
It's 2008.

2875
02:15:46.96 --> 02:15:52.76
So he was still like just back from being out in the private sector for a number of years.

2876
02:15:52.76 --> 02:15:58.32
So like he was, I feel like he was still like giddy and just, Hey, life is, life is chill.

2877
02:15:58.32 --> 02:15:59.32
It's good.

2878
02:15:59.32 --> 02:16:01.32
It's, you know, nothing's really taking me down.

2879
02:16:01.32 --> 02:16:03.000
At least that's how I remember him.

2880
02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.96
If, you know, we go back to the examples that I already gave of Marcus with, you know, our

2881
02:16:07.96 --> 02:16:11.52
son crawling all over him and showing up with the picked geraniums.

2882
02:16:11.52 --> 02:16:15.28
Like he was still very much into being a husband and a dad.

2883
02:16:15.28 --> 02:16:22.68
And even in his first and second platoons, you know, with Maggie's birth, he was there

2884
02:16:22.68 --> 02:16:25.92
where work came first, but he was there.

2885
02:16:25.92 --> 02:16:31.96
What we transitioned into was living completely separate lives.

2886
02:16:31.96 --> 02:16:36.92
And so he would come home and he would say things like, Hey, where are your cups?

2887
02:16:36.92 --> 02:16:40.56
You know, in his own home that he was paying for.

2888
02:16:40.56 --> 02:16:45.48
And we would get everything looking perfect because he would be home for five days, which

2889
02:16:45.48 --> 02:16:49.68
you know, it was pretty typical between trips.

2890
02:16:49.68 --> 02:16:57.24
Living more than that was a pretty long time, but he had, we had become distant and I had

2891
02:16:57.24 --> 02:17:01.72
become, you know, way more rooted in my friends and my life and my kids.

2892
02:17:01.72 --> 02:17:08.36
And it was okay that we live separate lives because the ladies that I was around and their

2893
02:17:08.36 --> 02:17:10.68
children were living that same life.

2894
02:17:10.68 --> 02:17:17.96
And so there was this shared respect and sacrifice that no one else understood, but the people

2895
02:17:17.96 --> 02:17:21.72
in your inner circle knew without having to even talk about.

2896
02:17:21.72 --> 02:17:30.16
And so as he was becoming more and more distant, I guess you just sort of chalk it up to that's

2897
02:17:30.16 --> 02:17:32.48
how things are now.

2898
02:17:32.48 --> 02:17:39.04
And do you actually notice it or is it like the proverbial like boiling of a frog where

2899
02:17:39.04 --> 02:17:43.48
it's just like the frog doesn't know that the water is getting hot until it's all of

2900
02:17:43.48 --> 02:17:44.48
a sudden it's dead.

2901
02:17:44.48 --> 02:17:45.98
It's too slow.

2902
02:17:45.98 --> 02:17:47.24
Is it like that kind of thing where?

2903
02:17:47.24 --> 02:17:48.24
I think so.

2904
02:17:48.24 --> 02:17:50.92
You're just going through it and it's like, oh, yeah, he's going on another trip and oh,

2905
02:17:50.92 --> 02:17:55.96
it's another trip and he's back, but he's, you know, going to sleep or I don't want to

2906
02:17:55.96 --> 02:17:57.88
bother him that type of thing over time.

2907
02:17:57.88 --> 02:18:02.84
Yeah, like we could play nice for those five day spans where the house looked perfect and

2908
02:18:02.84 --> 02:18:08.36
the kids behaved perfect and he was as present as he could be.

2909
02:18:08.36 --> 02:18:14.04
But it became a lot more comfortable to live separately.

2910
02:18:14.04 --> 02:18:19.000
And you know, it was all in the name of the United States of America.

2911
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.88
It was all for the greater good.

2912
02:18:20.88 --> 02:18:26.52
And it felt like when he would come home, he would certainly be more checked out.

2913
02:18:26.52 --> 02:18:28.28
Like he couldn't wait to leave again.

2914
02:18:28.28 --> 02:18:35.16
Like I could sense that and family time felt like forced time, especially at the command.

2915
02:18:35.16 --> 02:18:38.64
So it was getting really hard.

2916
02:18:38.64 --> 02:18:42.52
He was getting certainly pulling away more drinking more.

2917
02:18:42.52 --> 02:18:46.12
He felt like a stranger.

2918
02:18:46.12 --> 02:18:51.84
How much are you drinking at this point?

2919
02:18:51.84 --> 02:18:52.84
Normal amounts.

2920
02:18:52.84 --> 02:18:55.44
By team standards.

2921
02:18:55.44 --> 02:18:58.44
By our standards, by the Bros standards.

2922
02:18:58.44 --> 02:19:05.28
Yeah, I think we just, man, we just went around a rabbit hole.

2923
02:19:05.28 --> 02:19:13.000
I mean, we, I think I was just drinking a lot of bourbon often.

2924
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.12
But I never really knew that because I wasn't with him that much.

2925
02:19:16.12 --> 02:19:19.36
Yeah, but even when I came home, like it was.

2926
02:19:19.36 --> 02:19:24.64
I didn't know like what his drinking habits were because we were really never together.

2927
02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:30.04
I mean, the last couple of years that you were deploying, he was gone for almost 300

2928
02:19:30.04 --> 02:19:31.04
days a year.

2929
02:19:31.04 --> 02:19:32.04
Like, you know.

2930
02:19:32.04 --> 02:19:33.92
But I think it's pretty toxic.

2931
02:19:33.92 --> 02:19:35.96
I mean, we're all, everyone's doing the same thing.

2932
02:19:35.96 --> 02:19:37.60
Everyone's drinking hard.

2933
02:19:37.60 --> 02:19:39.72
Everyone's, I think, going through the same things.

2934
02:19:39.72 --> 02:19:41.84
Some are affected probably more than others.

2935
02:19:41.84 --> 02:19:45.16
And I didn't say anything wrong.

2936
02:19:45.16 --> 02:19:46.16
You didn't say anything wrong.

2937
02:19:46.16 --> 02:19:47.16
I mean.

2938
02:19:47.16 --> 02:19:50.40
At what point did you, at what point did you start to see something wrong?

2939
02:19:50.40 --> 02:19:51.40
2008.

2940
02:19:51.40 --> 02:19:52.40
Yeah, I think 2008.

2941
02:19:52.40 --> 02:19:53.40
Josh.

2942
02:19:53.40 --> 02:19:59.68
Yeah, Josh, one of my close best friends from Bud's and then through the teams passed

2943
02:19:59.68 --> 02:20:01.88
on a op.

2944
02:20:01.88 --> 02:20:04.36
And that was just unexpected.

2945
02:20:04.36 --> 02:20:07.36
And that was like a River and Stream crossing, right?

2946
02:20:07.36 --> 02:20:08.36
Yeah.

2947
02:20:08.36 --> 02:20:12.80
And it was just, it was tough because I was, I was supposed to do that River and Stream

2948
02:20:12.80 --> 02:20:15.32
crossing.

2949
02:20:15.32 --> 02:20:23.92
And we, when, when he got swept down the river, we, I think we looked for him for almost,

2950
02:20:23.92 --> 02:20:27.08
it's like 10 to 12 hours.

2951
02:20:27.08 --> 02:20:29.76
And then he washed up 50 clicks down.

2952
02:20:29.76 --> 02:20:33.64
And then he got a cone hour, which was like a class four rabbit.

2953
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:34.64
It was, it was nasty.

2954
02:20:34.64 --> 02:20:35.64
It was gnarly.

2955
02:20:35.64 --> 02:20:41.92
So just, you know, seeing him kind of get, get pulled out of the water is like really,

2956
02:20:41.92 --> 02:20:45.16
it's not, not good.

2957
02:20:45.16 --> 02:20:46.16
Not good.

2958
02:20:46.16 --> 02:20:54.68
And myself and another individual took his body back to his, his family in North Carolina.

2959
02:20:54.68 --> 02:20:56.32
And we stayed there a week.

2960
02:20:56.32 --> 02:21:02.92
And then we were there is when Jason Dusty got killed like a couple of days later on

2961
02:21:02.92 --> 02:21:05.24
an op to direct fire.

2962
02:21:05.24 --> 02:21:08.04
Both of them got shot.

2963
02:21:08.04 --> 02:21:10.28
And of course we were supposed to be on that op.

2964
02:21:10.28 --> 02:21:14.08
And it was just, you know, it was just, you know, you went through it, Jaco.

2965
02:21:14.08 --> 02:21:20.92
And it was just one of those times that was, it was, you know, I tried to look at it as

2966
02:21:20.92 --> 02:21:22.60
like, though, this is what it's supposed to be.

2967
02:21:22.60 --> 02:21:24.20
Like this is just the way it happens.

2968
02:21:24.20 --> 02:21:26.68
I became numb after a while.

2969
02:21:26.68 --> 02:21:31.28
You know, even when extortion went down, I remember talking to Scott Moore, I'm a more

2970
02:21:31.28 --> 02:21:32.28
about it.

2971
02:21:32.28 --> 02:21:34.16
I was like, Admiral, I'm fucking numb to this.

2972
02:21:34.16 --> 02:21:35.72
Like this doesn't affect me anymore.

2973
02:21:35.72 --> 02:21:37.40
Like I don't just, I don't get it.

2974
02:21:37.40 --> 02:21:39.08
Like, why is this still happening?

2975
02:21:39.08 --> 02:21:43.16
And it was just, it was just the conversation we were having, I think, through these years,

2976
02:21:43.16 --> 02:21:47.000
we're just getting just odd.

2977
02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.84
And I think I remember seeing this, the psych for the first time in, in 08 at the command,

2978
02:21:51.84 --> 02:21:55.32
just like asking him, like, what's, what's going on?

2979
02:21:55.32 --> 02:21:58.60
Can you, you know, help me out a little bit or whatever?

2980
02:21:58.60 --> 02:22:03.68
And that was like the first time I ever actually went and spoke to somebody, but we didn't

2981
02:22:03.68 --> 02:22:04.68
talk about it.

2982
02:22:04.68 --> 02:22:06.60
Like nobody talked about it, maybe.

2983
02:22:06.60 --> 02:22:11.40
But he also has, we have his medical record and I was just looking through it and it says,

2984
02:22:11.40 --> 02:22:16.88
like, you know, decided not to talk to the command psych for fear of not being able to

2985
02:22:16.88 --> 02:22:20.68
deploy, which is the, you need to hear all the time.

2986
02:22:20.68 --> 02:22:23.04
I don't, I don't remember, I don't remember that.

2987
02:22:23.04 --> 02:22:24.04
Yeah.

2988
02:22:24.04 --> 02:22:27.68
So I was certainly noticing that he, it just, it seemed like he was just like a renegade

2989
02:22:27.68 --> 02:22:28.68
to me.

2990
02:22:28.68 --> 02:22:29.68
He did not care.

2991
02:22:29.68 --> 02:22:30.84
He did not care.

2992
02:22:30.84 --> 02:22:32.64
And those deployments were so insane.

2993
02:22:32.64 --> 02:22:34.84
It's like, someone was dying every deployment.

2994
02:22:34.84 --> 02:22:37.16
And so it felt like Russia and roulette.

2995
02:22:37.16 --> 02:22:44.12
And I just, between Josh in 2008 and then there were, you know, other deaths that weren't

2996
02:22:44.12 --> 02:22:45.12
so close to us.

2997
02:22:45.12 --> 02:22:51.12
And Adam Brown dying in 2010, who were very, very close with Adam and his family and our

2998
02:22:51.12 --> 02:22:54.72
kids best friends at the time.

2999
02:22:54.72 --> 02:22:56.20
I was just like, this is nuts.

3000
02:22:56.20 --> 02:22:58.20
We can't do this anymore.

3001
02:22:58.20 --> 02:22:59.20
Yeah.

3002
02:22:59.20 --> 02:23:02.12
And so it got, got to a point where I just felt like I had to do something different.

3003
02:23:02.12 --> 02:23:05.72
I wasn't like fully, fully checked in.

3004
02:23:05.72 --> 02:23:09.08
And again, talking to the admiral, he's like, you should go to OCS.

3005
02:23:09.08 --> 02:23:10.96
He's like, you should be an officer.

3006
02:23:10.96 --> 02:23:13.76
I'm like, I just, I need a break right now.

3007
02:23:13.76 --> 02:23:14.76
Bad.

3008
02:23:14.76 --> 02:23:15.76
He's like, now I just go to OCS.

3009
02:23:15.76 --> 02:23:17.000
You're going to be a good officer.

3010
02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:21.88
And so I went to OCS for like two days.

3011
02:23:21.88 --> 02:23:23.38
Oh yeah.

3012
02:23:23.38 --> 02:23:24.38
Yeah.

3013
02:23:24.38 --> 02:23:25.88
Didn't you have to put like a package?

3014
02:23:25.88 --> 02:23:26.88
Oh yeah.

3015
02:23:26.88 --> 02:23:27.88
I did fucking all this shit.

3016
02:23:27.88 --> 02:23:28.88
I did.

3017
02:23:28.88 --> 02:23:29.88
You kind of.

3018
02:23:29.88 --> 02:23:33.80
He even passed up being promoted to chief so someone else could have it because he thought

3019
02:23:33.80 --> 02:23:34.80
he was going to.

3020
02:23:34.80 --> 02:23:35.80
I did.

3021
02:23:35.80 --> 02:23:39.76
I went in and, I went in and talked to the, yeah, the CMC at the time said, don't make

3022
02:23:39.76 --> 02:23:40.76
me a chief.

3023
02:23:40.76 --> 02:23:44.16
I said, make so-and-so a chief because I'm, you know, I'm going to go to OCS.

3024
02:23:44.16 --> 02:23:47.76
Like, why would you make me a chief and I'm like, you're going to take it away from somebody.

3025
02:23:47.76 --> 02:23:52.20
So they didn't, they made him chief and I went to OCS.

3026
02:23:52.20 --> 02:23:55.76
So you knew what you were getting into with this?

3027
02:23:55.76 --> 02:23:56.76
No.

3028
02:23:56.76 --> 02:23:57.76
Obviously I did.

3029
02:23:57.76 --> 02:23:58.76
Because.

3030
02:23:58.76 --> 02:23:59.76
No, I didn't.

3031
02:23:59.76 --> 02:24:00.76
I didn't.

3032
02:24:00.76 --> 02:24:01.76
Honestly, like I didn't.

3033
02:24:01.76 --> 02:24:03.76
I was not, I wasn't thinking clearly.

3034
02:24:03.76 --> 02:24:04.92
Let me ask you this.

3035
02:24:04.92 --> 02:24:07.24
When you went and talked to the psychologist.

3036
02:24:07.24 --> 02:24:08.24
Yeah.

3037
02:24:08.24 --> 02:24:11.16
What do you say, what do they say?

3038
02:24:11.16 --> 02:24:17.16
They have like a, you know, they have their standard list of like SOP, you know, like

3039
02:24:17.16 --> 02:24:18.72
what's, how's your home life?

3040
02:24:18.72 --> 02:24:20.08
You know, how is your family?

3041
02:24:20.08 --> 02:24:22.08
You're like, oh, my wife is great.

3042
02:24:22.08 --> 02:24:23.08
My kids are great.

3043
02:24:23.08 --> 02:24:24.08
It's fine.

3044
02:24:24.08 --> 02:24:25.08
Like, are you drinking?

3045
02:24:25.08 --> 02:24:26.08
Yeah.

3046
02:24:26.08 --> 02:24:27.08
Yeah.

3047
02:24:27.08 --> 02:24:28.08
A little bit.

3048
02:24:28.08 --> 02:24:30.20
But you know, normally what, you know, what the guys are doing, nothing, you know, like

3049
02:24:30.20 --> 02:24:33.08
it's, it's very vanilla, right?

3050
02:24:33.08 --> 02:24:34.08
It's very templated.

3051
02:24:34.08 --> 02:24:38.76
And I think, you know, obviously we'll talk about the route that I went eventually when

3052
02:24:38.76 --> 02:24:46.08
I separated, but I think that's the problem is like, you go to school and they try to

3053
02:24:46.08 --> 02:24:49.76
solve a problem in this box that they're taught, but everybody's different.

3054
02:24:49.76 --> 02:24:53.52
Like you're different than me and I'm different from her.

3055
02:24:53.52 --> 02:24:57.20
Like they can't use a standardized template to, I think.

3056
02:24:57.20 --> 02:24:58.88
It's also like a check in the box.

3057
02:24:58.88 --> 02:25:03.44
Like, you know, it's actually called the 30 minute checkup from the neck up.

3058
02:25:03.44 --> 02:25:04.44
Right.

3059
02:25:04.44 --> 02:25:05.44
Oh, is it?

3060
02:25:05.44 --> 02:25:06.44
Oh, wait.

3061
02:25:06.44 --> 02:25:08.48
Is this like a, like they say, Hey, did you get ordered to go do this?

3062
02:25:08.48 --> 02:25:10.44
This is a start part of the standard operating procedure.

3063
02:25:10.44 --> 02:25:11.44
Okay.

3064
02:25:11.44 --> 02:25:12.44
You're back from three deployments.

3065
02:25:12.44 --> 02:25:13.44
You got to go check in with the site.

3066
02:25:13.44 --> 02:25:18.08
Is that what I don't think you give the answers, you know, that you think we'll probably get

3067
02:25:18.08 --> 02:25:19.08
them off your back.

3068
02:25:19.08 --> 02:25:20.08
Yeah.

3069
02:25:20.08 --> 02:25:21.64
Let me, let me figure out what I have to say.

3070
02:25:21.64 --> 02:25:22.64
Yeah.

3071
02:25:22.64 --> 02:25:23.64
So they're not life is fine.

3072
02:25:23.64 --> 02:25:24.64
Kids are great.

3073
02:25:24.64 --> 02:25:25.64
I'm ready to deploy.

3074
02:25:25.64 --> 02:25:26.64
Yeah.

3075
02:25:26.64 --> 02:25:27.64
I'm good.

3076
02:25:27.64 --> 02:25:28.64
And so is that what you did?

3077
02:25:28.64 --> 02:25:30.44
And you go in there because you said you were a little, you were starting to feel it

3078
02:25:30.44 --> 02:25:31.44
a little bit.

3079
02:25:31.44 --> 02:25:35.84
Did you expose that at all when you talked to this, this doctor or not really?

3080
02:25:35.84 --> 02:25:38.72
I don't think so, I don't even remember.

3081
02:25:38.72 --> 02:25:39.72
I'm not sure.

3082
02:25:39.72 --> 02:25:43.12
I just remember him telling me, Marcus, you guys aren't crazy.

3083
02:25:43.12 --> 02:25:45.48
He's like, but your wives, he's like, they're freaking nuts.

3084
02:25:45.48 --> 02:25:46.48
Well, it is crazy.

3085
02:25:46.48 --> 02:25:50.40
I mean, like I literally, like of all the conversations, that's what I remember.

3086
02:25:50.40 --> 02:25:51.92
He's like, Marcus, I don't think you guys are crazy.

3087
02:25:51.92 --> 02:25:54.04
He's like, but I do think your wives are crazy.

3088
02:25:54.04 --> 02:25:57.44
I'm like, whatever you say, I'm on board.

3089
02:25:57.44 --> 02:25:59.60
So that's kind of crazy that you went in there.

3090
02:25:59.60 --> 02:26:04.000
You're feeling like something's not right, but you still get like an up check to go to

3091
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000
OCS, by the way.

3092
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:12.20
It was, the reason I went to OCS is because I believed in, in the Admiral.

3093
02:26:12.20 --> 02:26:13.20
I believe in my skipper.

3094
02:26:13.20 --> 02:26:14.44
Like that's the only thing I got.

3095
02:26:14.44 --> 02:26:16.60
I don't want to let him down at all.

3096
02:26:16.60 --> 02:26:17.80
And he's all fired up.

3097
02:26:17.80 --> 02:26:18.80
So fired up.

3098
02:26:18.80 --> 02:26:19.80
He's all fired up.

3099
02:26:19.80 --> 02:26:20.80
He's like, hell yeah.

3100
02:26:20.80 --> 02:26:21.80
So he's fired up.

3101
02:26:21.80 --> 02:26:22.80
I love him.

3102
02:26:22.80 --> 02:26:23.80
Yeah, for sure.

3103
02:26:23.80 --> 02:26:25.80
And so he tells you, no, you're going to be a great officer who sends you OCS and you're

3104
02:26:25.80 --> 02:26:26.80
like, Roger.

3105
02:26:26.80 --> 02:26:28.80
I'm like, Roger that it made sense on paper.

3106
02:26:28.80 --> 02:26:29.80
For sure.

3107
02:26:29.80 --> 02:26:34.80
But I remember, but I remember telling my close friends like, like, no.

3108
02:26:34.80 --> 02:26:39.40
Like my very close friends was like, like, I can't, I can't do this right now.

3109
02:26:39.40 --> 02:26:40.80
Like I can't, I'm not good.

3110
02:26:40.80 --> 02:26:42.40
He's like, no, bro, you got to go.

3111
02:26:42.40 --> 02:26:43.40
Like you're going to regret this.

3112
02:26:43.40 --> 02:26:44.90
I'm like, no, you don't understand.

3113
02:26:44.90 --> 02:26:46.60
Like I can't, like I'm not good.

3114
02:26:46.60 --> 02:26:47.60
He's like, Marcus, you got to get on that plane.

3115
02:26:47.60 --> 02:26:49.40
What did you mean by not good?

3116
02:26:49.40 --> 02:26:52.10
Like I was just not, I was not into it anymore.

3117
02:26:52.10 --> 02:27:02.48
Like I was not mentally like focused or determined or like driven or like any of it.

3118
02:27:02.48 --> 02:27:05.52
Like I just didn't, didn't want to be there.

3119
02:27:05.52 --> 02:27:07.000
Were you seeing this amber?

3120
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:12.60
I was, but I was also in a complete tailspin because we just needed to, we needed to change

3121
02:27:12.60 --> 02:27:13.60
the scenery.

3122
02:27:13.60 --> 02:27:16.88
I just needed like a calm in the storm to, to reassess.

3123
02:27:16.88 --> 02:27:21.80
You can like survive in like a tornado, for example, it's much easier to survive than

3124
02:27:21.80 --> 02:27:23.44
it is to like survey the damage.

3125
02:27:23.44 --> 02:27:25.88
I was in complete survival mode.

3126
02:27:25.88 --> 02:27:30.24
And so it seemed like, okay, well, this is something that could get me to the other side

3127
02:27:30.24 --> 02:27:31.24
to survey the damage.

3128
02:27:31.24 --> 02:27:32.88
That's a good metaphor.

3129
02:27:32.88 --> 02:27:36.92
So you're like in the storm shelter, you, there's just mayhem going, you're okay in

3130
02:27:36.92 --> 02:27:39.48
the shelter, but you know, at some point you got to get out of this thing and you got to

3131
02:27:39.48 --> 02:27:40.48
get somewhere safe.

3132
02:27:40.48 --> 02:27:41.48
Yeah.

3133
02:27:41.48 --> 02:27:42.48
Yeah.

3134
02:27:42.48 --> 02:27:45.80
And then once the storm is over, like, you know, you think about like any natural disaster

3135
02:27:45.80 --> 02:27:51.24
we lived in on the East coast, hurricanes, like preparing and surviving the hurricane

3136
02:27:51.24 --> 02:27:52.60
isn't the hard part.

3137
02:27:52.60 --> 02:27:56.08
The hard part is cleaning up all the mess on the other side.

3138
02:27:56.08 --> 02:27:59.80
And so I knew we needed to get to a place where we could start cleaning up the mess,

3139
02:27:59.80 --> 02:28:03.60
but you just, you're in such survival mode that you don't even know what that looks like.

3140
02:28:03.60 --> 02:28:06.84
And so for me, OCS sort of like checked that box.

3141
02:28:06.84 --> 02:28:09.52
It was a different change of scenery.

3142
02:28:09.52 --> 02:28:13.52
And in my mind, Marcus always needed a goal.

3143
02:28:13.52 --> 02:28:16.84
His goal was to get a scholarship to become a seal, to get to the command.

3144
02:28:16.84 --> 02:28:19.72
This was just the natural next goal.

3145
02:28:19.72 --> 02:28:26.48
I didn't know that he was so depleted mentally that he didn't have the willpower to care

3146
02:28:26.48 --> 02:28:27.48
about the goal.

3147
02:28:27.48 --> 02:28:32.52
And it was the first time that I had ever seen him not care about a goal.

3148
02:28:32.52 --> 02:28:35.64
That's what I was going to ask you, because you're describing a mess, right?

3149
02:28:35.64 --> 02:28:39.56
But at the same time, you're both also kind of like, you know, the kids are doing good.

3150
02:28:39.56 --> 02:28:40.56
You're doing good.

3151
02:28:40.56 --> 02:28:41.56
We're doing everything.

3152
02:28:41.56 --> 02:28:42.56
No, we're doing everything.

3153
02:28:42.56 --> 02:28:46.96
So was there some like under the reason I'm asking you this question or this line of

3154
02:28:46.96 --> 02:28:52.32
questioning is because if someone is a wife and they're looking at their husband, what

3155
02:28:52.32 --> 02:28:53.32
are they looking for?

3156
02:28:53.32 --> 02:28:54.32
And how do they go?

3157
02:28:54.32 --> 02:28:55.32
Oh, you know what?

3158
02:28:55.32 --> 02:28:56.32
I see.

3159
02:28:56.32 --> 02:28:57.32
I know what this is.

3160
02:28:57.32 --> 02:28:58.92
I understand what's happening.

3161
02:28:58.92 --> 02:29:00.84
There's a loss of motivation.

3162
02:29:00.84 --> 02:29:02.000
Did you see behaviors?

3163
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:08.32
Was there anything that you said this is not, Marcus is not in a good spot right now?

3164
02:29:08.32 --> 02:29:09.32
Yeah.

3165
02:29:09.32 --> 02:29:10.32
Yeah.

3166
02:29:10.32 --> 02:29:12.88
I mean, there were certain, I just felt like he was reckless.

3167
02:29:12.88 --> 02:29:16.16
I felt like he was a complete renegade.

3168
02:29:16.16 --> 02:29:17.68
He just didn't care.

3169
02:29:17.68 --> 02:29:23.84
And so for me, OCS was a way to dial it back in, give him some direction and focus because

3170
02:29:23.84 --> 02:29:26.76
like, I mean, he didn't cut his hair for nine months.

3171
02:29:26.76 --> 02:29:32.80
He was drinking and then like the RSO the next day, like drinking until four AM, then

3172
02:29:32.80 --> 02:29:33.96
the RSO at eight.

3173
02:29:33.96 --> 02:29:42.000
Like it, to me, it was just sort of like very atypical behavior for him.

3174
02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Maybe not necessarily of the teams, but he was so laser focused that the sudden sort

3175
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.08
of renegade attitude was definitely alarming at the same time.

3176
02:29:51.08 --> 02:29:52.56
I never saw him.

3177
02:29:52.56 --> 02:29:57.44
That was probably 10 times worse than I knew OCS today.

3178
02:29:57.44 --> 02:30:03.40
OCS is because I went to OCS and I can't imagine.

3179
02:30:03.40 --> 02:30:07.80
You'd come back from deployment like literally a week or two prior.

3180
02:30:07.80 --> 02:30:08.80
I fucking hate it.

3181
02:30:08.80 --> 02:30:13.64
I showed up and you know, you have all the Marines and yelling and shit and you have

3182
02:30:13.64 --> 02:30:17.40
like a rack like this and they're like, fuck is this guy?

3183
02:30:17.40 --> 02:30:19.64
And I honestly, I'm out of less than a day and a half.

3184
02:30:19.64 --> 02:30:22.68
I remember sitting, first off, I was getting migraines.

3185
02:30:22.68 --> 02:30:29.64
They gave me, they got me ibuprofen six hours after I was fucking hurting.

3186
02:30:29.64 --> 02:30:31.96
And then I remember sitting on the floor, my back was killing me.

3187
02:30:31.96 --> 02:30:38.60
I had all types of like shit going on, my L4 and L5.

3188
02:30:38.60 --> 02:30:42.24
And I'm like trying to read the, was it 11 general orders of the century?

3189
02:30:42.24 --> 02:30:46.16
Like I'm trying to memorize them.

3190
02:30:46.16 --> 02:30:50.12
And I remember taking the book and throwing it across the room and I'm like, hey, who's

3191
02:30:50.12 --> 02:30:51.12
in charge here?

3192
02:30:51.12 --> 02:30:52.12
Like a very nice way.

3193
02:30:52.12 --> 02:30:55.68
Oh, the sentence says like, can I speak to him please?

3194
02:30:55.68 --> 02:30:57.20
Yeah, sure.

3195
02:30:57.20 --> 02:30:59.08
I was like, hey, sir, here's the deal.

3196
02:30:59.08 --> 02:31:01.80
I was like, I just got back from my six combat deployment.

3197
02:31:01.80 --> 02:31:03.52
I was like, I got back a week and a half ago.

3198
02:31:03.52 --> 02:31:05.88
I'm like, and I'm in curse.

3199
02:31:05.88 --> 02:31:10.48
I was like, why are, if I have to go to OCS, like, why are you guys sending me with people

3200
02:31:10.48 --> 02:31:12.76
who like never been here before?

3201
02:31:12.76 --> 02:31:15.28
Like, I don't want to be around any of these people.

3202
02:31:15.28 --> 02:31:18.12
Like, honestly, I was like, I just want to go back to my unit.

3203
02:31:18.12 --> 02:31:21.000
He's like, you know, we usually keep guys here for 12 weeks.

3204
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:22.40
He's like, you can go tomorrow.

3205
02:31:22.40 --> 02:31:23.96
I'm like, thank you.

3206
02:31:23.96 --> 02:31:24.96
And I did that.

3207
02:31:24.96 --> 02:31:26.12
Dude, that's insane.

3208
02:31:26.12 --> 02:31:28.56
Oh, it was, I was like, what am I doing?

3209
02:31:28.56 --> 02:31:31.000
I'm like, I'm learning how to fold my underwear again.

3210
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Are you kidding me?

3211
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.12
And I remember going back and telling Admiral, I was like, hey, I was like, if you want good

3212
02:31:36.12 --> 02:31:41.20
people to like stay in, you guys got to figure out this OCS thing after guys are going over

3213
02:31:41.20 --> 02:31:43.92
to see us to war for 10 or 15 years.

3214
02:31:43.92 --> 02:31:47.60
Like, come on, like, that's just, you're going to, you're going to get more people like me

3215
02:31:47.60 --> 02:31:48.80
that are like, fuck this.

3216
02:31:48.80 --> 02:31:51.28
Or they hear about what OCS is.

3217
02:31:51.28 --> 02:31:54.88
And instead of going through the whole process of sending their packet in, they're just going

3218
02:31:54.88 --> 02:31:56.48
to hear about it and go, there's no chance.

3219
02:31:56.48 --> 02:31:59.28
Because that's what I've told, I talked to a bunch of people when I got back, they're

3220
02:31:59.28 --> 02:32:01.000
like, oh yeah, you didn't know that?

3221
02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.76
They're like, that's why I didn't go.

3222
02:32:02.76 --> 02:32:07.92
I was like, how can you go deal with that for another 12 weeks after all the other shit?

3223
02:32:07.92 --> 02:32:10.64
They're like, so I didn't, they go, but there's this work around.

3224
02:32:10.64 --> 02:32:16.48
And if you, if you become a, it's like, if you go on reserve, you go to like a fork and

3225
02:32:16.48 --> 02:32:21.12
knife school for like four weeks, you get pinned and then you go back on active duty.

3226
02:32:21.12 --> 02:32:22.80
Like they decided to tell me that.

3227
02:32:22.80 --> 02:32:23.80
They figured something out.

3228
02:32:23.80 --> 02:32:24.80
Yeah, they figured something out.

3229
02:32:24.80 --> 02:32:29.76
But he honestly, like he knew, intuitively you knew, you shouldn't have gone.

3230
02:32:29.76 --> 02:32:30.76
That was no chance.

3231
02:32:30.76 --> 02:32:31.76
He called from the airport.

3232
02:32:31.76 --> 02:32:34.08
He called me and he called his best friend.

3233
02:32:34.08 --> 02:32:38.24
And I think I said, like, you've got to listen to your gut.

3234
02:32:38.24 --> 02:32:42.68
And he just ended up pushing through and getting on the plane and going.

3235
02:32:42.68 --> 02:32:45.76
But the day I showed up and like, what am I, I'm not, what am I doing?

3236
02:32:45.76 --> 02:32:49.56
Yeah, that's this is fucking the last place I want to be camp welcome.

3237
02:32:49.56 --> 02:32:51.56
Like so ridiculous.

3238
02:32:51.56 --> 02:32:52.56
Yeah, it was good.

3239
02:32:52.56 --> 02:32:54.04
So they sent you right back to the command.

3240
02:32:54.04 --> 02:32:55.04
Yeah.

3241
02:32:55.04 --> 02:32:56.56
And they usually keep people out process.

3242
02:32:56.56 --> 02:33:01.84
They keep people holding stuff like 12, 12 or 13 weeks at OCS.

3243
02:33:01.84 --> 02:33:03.68
And yeah, they let me go like the next day.

3244
02:33:03.68 --> 02:33:07.92
And what did the, what did like the commands look like the detailer say?

3245
02:33:07.92 --> 02:33:12.04
They were just like, what, you know, what is that's bizarre, dude, like get a bill.

3246
02:33:12.04 --> 02:33:14.04
It's hard to get a bill to OCS.

3247
02:33:14.04 --> 02:33:15.04
I know.

3248
02:33:15.04 --> 02:33:16.04
I did have to apologize to Admiral.

3249
02:33:16.04 --> 02:33:18.32
He's like, Hey, I'm like, I know.

3250
02:33:18.32 --> 02:33:22.000
I was like, I know.

3251
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.24
But he was, I also think he was on the, the committee that that selected you.

3252
02:33:28.24 --> 02:33:29.24
Yeah.

3253
02:33:29.24 --> 02:33:32.24
Well, I'm sure he had a lot of pull whatever his position was.

3254
02:33:32.24 --> 02:33:33.24
Yeah, for sure.

3255
02:33:33.24 --> 02:33:37.64
But in hindsight, it's like, who ever thought that that was a good idea?

3256
02:33:37.64 --> 02:33:41.72
But anyway, but yeah, so I went back and they were like, Hey, what do you need to do?

3257
02:33:41.72 --> 02:33:45.12
I said, I just, you know, there's someone out there right now going, see, OCS is so

3258
02:33:45.12 --> 02:33:46.12
hard.

3259
02:33:46.12 --> 02:33:47.12
So much hard.

3260
02:33:47.12 --> 02:33:48.12
It's got to quit.

3261
02:33:48.12 --> 02:33:49.12
Yeah.

3262
02:33:49.12 --> 02:33:50.12
I quit.

3263
02:33:50.12 --> 02:33:51.12
Yeah.

3264
02:33:51.12 --> 02:33:56.16
So I just told him, I said, Hey, I need, I just need a break.

3265
02:33:56.16 --> 02:33:58.12
It's where, wherever that is.

3266
02:33:58.12 --> 02:34:01.56
I said, I was thinking maybe, maybe go out to the West Coast and just forget about stuff.

3267
02:34:01.56 --> 02:34:02.56
And I'm like, yeah, that's fine.

3268
02:34:02.56 --> 02:34:03.56
Go do it.

3269
02:34:03.56 --> 02:34:04.56
So that's what we did.

3270
02:34:04.56 --> 02:34:10.68
And I just went out to, yeah, went to the center and wanted to teach tactics and they

3271
02:34:10.68 --> 02:34:14.80
threw me in first phase, which is like the worst place they could have put me.

3272
02:34:14.80 --> 02:34:17.08
And it was not good.

3273
02:34:17.08 --> 02:34:21.56
Like I was, and as you know, all the guys are are awesome.

3274
02:34:21.56 --> 02:34:30.32
Like good dudes, all of them been overseas, hard, hard nose dudes, like great workers.

3275
02:34:30.32 --> 02:34:31.76
I didn't want to be around anybody.

3276
02:34:31.76 --> 02:34:33.88
I was like, I don't want to make friends with anybody.

3277
02:34:33.88 --> 02:34:36.76
They probably thought I was like standoffish because like I didn't want to hang out with

3278
02:34:36.76 --> 02:34:37.76
anybody.

3279
02:34:37.76 --> 02:34:40.32
It was just, it was just not a good time.

3280
02:34:40.32 --> 02:34:46.56
I, I body slammed a student in front of the flagpole and like one of the, one of the instructor

3281
02:34:46.56 --> 02:34:51.20
staff grabbed me and he was like, Hey man, so you, like you're going to get a lot of

3282
02:34:51.20 --> 02:34:53.80
trouble if you don't fucking like tone it down.

3283
02:34:53.80 --> 02:34:55.20
Like, I don't know what's going on.

3284
02:34:55.20 --> 02:34:59.40
And so there was just a lot of little things like that that were starting to happen.

3285
02:34:59.40 --> 02:35:00.88
And I just didn't care.

3286
02:35:00.88 --> 02:35:05.04
I was like, you know, fuck everybody, you know, at the time.

3287
02:35:05.04 --> 02:35:11.32
One of my guys, JP to know who's been on this podcast a few times and he was, he was in

3288
02:35:11.32 --> 02:35:12.64
my task unit.

3289
02:35:12.64 --> 02:35:17.000
It was in Ramadi, came back, went to another platoon and then they got from shoulder surgery

3290
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.68
and got pulled out and they sent him to buds.

3291
02:35:18.68 --> 02:35:20.80
And it was like one month deep.

3292
02:35:20.80 --> 02:35:22.40
They called me over at trade at the leg.

3293
02:35:22.40 --> 02:35:23.76
You got to come get your boy.

3294
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:25.24
It was the same thing.

3295
02:35:25.24 --> 02:35:32.000
He was just not in a good headspace to be putting students through, you know, first

3296
02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.72
phase because you just wasn't in the right spot, you know, like had to get him out of

3297
02:35:36.72 --> 02:35:39.52
there and get some frigate.

3298
02:35:39.52 --> 02:35:45.48
He was a loose cannon.

3299
02:35:45.48 --> 02:35:48.24
You're working for, how long are you in first phase for?

3300
02:35:48.24 --> 02:35:49.36
First phase for a year.

3301
02:35:49.36 --> 02:35:51.76
And then finally they kicked me over to the SQT.

3302
02:35:51.76 --> 02:35:55.04
No, no, no, you're sitting here saying like, I don't want to be around anybody.

3303
02:35:55.04 --> 02:35:56.68
I didn't want to make friends with anybody.

3304
02:35:56.68 --> 02:35:57.68
What do you see in Amber?

3305
02:35:57.68 --> 02:35:59.40
Like, what does this look like to you?

3306
02:35:59.40 --> 02:36:07.08
We were talking home with him and we had been a part for the, the bigger part of every year

3307
02:36:07.08 --> 02:36:08.08
leading into this.

3308
02:36:08.08 --> 02:36:11.84
And so it was very, very, very difficult.

3309
02:36:11.84 --> 02:36:12.84
I know.

3310
02:36:12.84 --> 02:36:14.28
I was trying to be optimistic.

3311
02:36:14.28 --> 02:36:17.56
We were super settled in Virginia Beach and so I'm like, Oh, a new beginning.

3312
02:36:17.56 --> 02:36:19.24
I bought cruisers for everyone.

3313
02:36:19.24 --> 02:36:23.40
I thought we would come out to California and suddenly be this happy family.

3314
02:36:23.40 --> 02:36:29.48
And when we got here, everything just completely hit the fan because I didn't have my community

3315
02:36:29.48 --> 02:36:30.48
anymore.

3316
02:36:30.48 --> 02:36:34.56
I mean, started every single morning at Sarah Wilkinson's gym, CrossFit Odyssey at the time.

3317
02:36:34.56 --> 02:36:39.08
It's core group of girls and my kids had their friends.

3318
02:36:39.08 --> 02:36:44.48
We had an amazing neighborhood, a great house and suddenly we're in California.

3319
02:36:44.48 --> 02:36:51.16
We don't know anyone and now Marcus is home and the kids, you know, like our son in particular

3320
02:36:51.16 --> 02:36:54.04
had this sort of idea of who Marcus was in his mind.

3321
02:36:54.04 --> 02:37:01.20
He was sort of like this myth of a dad and, you know, he really didn't know him.

3322
02:37:01.20 --> 02:37:07.20
And I think that whenever we, the dad that he got delivered back was nothing like the

3323
02:37:07.20 --> 02:37:10.56
dad that he had created in his mind at the time.

3324
02:37:10.56 --> 02:37:14.84
And so he started acting out like everything was going bad.

3325
02:37:14.84 --> 02:37:17.28
And I don't know.

3326
02:37:17.28 --> 02:37:18.28
I just...

3327
02:37:18.28 --> 02:37:22.80
It's hard for me to like picture this right now because you seem like a super chill dude,

3328
02:37:22.80 --> 02:37:25.32
like all nice and mellow.

3329
02:37:25.32 --> 02:37:28.24
And like, so what, like, what does this look like at home?

3330
02:37:28.24 --> 02:37:29.24
He had become a monster.

3331
02:37:29.24 --> 02:37:32.04
Well, first of all, he was completely disconnected to us.

3332
02:37:32.04 --> 02:37:35.36
It felt like he didn't want to be anywhere really.

3333
02:37:35.36 --> 02:37:38.000
I mean, I didn't feel like he wanted to be anyplace else.

3334
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.60
I felt like he wanted to be nowhere.

3335
02:37:39.60 --> 02:37:43.48
Like he didn't have a purpose, a belonging of...

3336
02:37:43.48 --> 02:37:47.28
He didn't give a damn about anything.

3337
02:37:47.28 --> 02:37:53.04
He was definitely drinking a lot, a lot more than I had realized or he started drinking

3338
02:37:53.04 --> 02:37:55.60
more than, you know, I was comfortable with.

3339
02:37:55.60 --> 02:38:01.84
And there were certainly times that I was...

3340
02:38:01.84 --> 02:38:06.36
I just thought there's no good way out of this.

3341
02:38:06.36 --> 02:38:09.72
Leaving him is not going to necessarily solve anything.

3342
02:38:09.72 --> 02:38:13.32
Staying with him, I don't know how much worse this can get.

3343
02:38:13.32 --> 02:38:14.32
Yeah.

3344
02:38:14.32 --> 02:38:16.04
But just to go back, Jaco.

3345
02:38:16.04 --> 02:38:18.16
I was still like, I was still functioning.

3346
02:38:18.16 --> 02:38:21.24
Like I was still, you know, engaging with the guys.

3347
02:38:21.24 --> 02:38:25.56
I mean, I had, you know, I had bros and stuff, but I was...

3348
02:38:25.56 --> 02:38:27.44
I didn't want to...

3349
02:38:27.44 --> 02:38:29.52
It wasn't fun for me anymore.

3350
02:38:29.52 --> 02:38:34.20
I didn't want to be one of the guys and, you know, it was just not...

3351
02:38:34.20 --> 02:38:35.44
It just wasn't the same.

3352
02:38:35.44 --> 02:38:38.20
It was just different.

3353
02:38:38.20 --> 02:38:41.56
You know, and thank God I got kicked over to SQT.

3354
02:38:41.56 --> 02:38:44.76
So I ran CQC for about a year and a half and a great staff.

3355
02:38:44.76 --> 02:38:48.20
I mean, those guys, you know, I joke because we had a great self.

3356
02:38:48.20 --> 02:38:49.60
I feel like those guys did everything.

3357
02:38:49.60 --> 02:38:51.64
I'm like, I didn't even need to be there.

3358
02:38:51.64 --> 02:38:53.36
Like literally the LPO from...

3359
02:38:53.36 --> 02:38:54.36
I mean, they just...

3360
02:38:54.36 --> 02:38:55.36
They ran the show.

3361
02:38:55.36 --> 02:38:58.44
And so thank goodness I was just kind of in the background just...

3362
02:38:58.44 --> 02:39:01.84
I think I started school online at USD.

3363
02:39:01.84 --> 02:39:05.16
I did a graduate program there.

3364
02:39:05.16 --> 02:39:08.88
So we would, you know, work the students in SQT and then at night we'd put them to bed

3365
02:39:08.88 --> 02:39:11.24
and then I would stay up and, you know, do work and stuff.

3366
02:39:11.24 --> 02:39:17.56
And so, you know, it wasn't like a complete mess.

3367
02:39:17.56 --> 02:39:19.60
You know, I think everything was like...

3368
02:39:19.60 --> 02:39:20.60
I was functioning.

3369
02:39:20.60 --> 02:39:21.60
It wasn't...

3370
02:39:21.60 --> 02:39:26.08
You know, I don't want to sit here and say like, you know, he was like stuck in the corner

3371
02:39:26.08 --> 02:39:28.60
of his house, sucking on his thumb every day.

3372
02:39:28.60 --> 02:39:30.92
No, no, no, you're still functioning.

3373
02:39:30.92 --> 02:39:32.92
Still going to work, but like you just didn't care.

3374
02:39:32.92 --> 02:39:33.92
Like you didn't...

3375
02:39:33.92 --> 02:39:34.92
I was just checking out everything.

3376
02:39:34.92 --> 02:39:38.60
Marcus doesn't do well without a goal and, you know, something to work towards.

3377
02:39:38.60 --> 02:39:39.60
And so...

3378
02:39:39.60 --> 02:39:41.12
I mean, most of us don't.

3379
02:39:41.12 --> 02:39:46.44
So going back to get his master's degree while he was at SQT was definitely like a check

3380
02:39:46.44 --> 02:39:47.44
in the box.

3381
02:39:47.44 --> 02:39:50.36
And then I think at some point...

3382
02:39:50.36 --> 02:39:54.04
Oh, well, then the bin lawn raid happened, which...

3383
02:39:54.04 --> 02:39:57.88
Well, it kind of lost my mind on that one, just not being there.

3384
02:39:57.88 --> 02:40:00.44
Like you, like put me in the...

3385
02:40:00.44 --> 02:40:01.44
Put me in coach.

3386
02:40:01.44 --> 02:40:07.04
There was like this big sort of like resurgence of let's get back to Virginia Beach and...

3387
02:40:07.04 --> 02:40:08.04
So I did.

3388
02:40:08.04 --> 02:40:09.04
I called up the CMC.

3389
02:40:09.04 --> 02:40:10.04
I was like, hey, I want to come back.

3390
02:40:10.04 --> 02:40:11.92
He's like, done, come back.

3391
02:40:11.92 --> 02:40:14.56
And then I just kind of faded quickly.

3392
02:40:14.56 --> 02:40:15.88
Well, no, it was replaced.

3393
02:40:15.88 --> 02:40:21.60
I mean, that was our plan was to go back and then extortion happened and, you know, so

3394
02:40:21.60 --> 02:40:24.000
many more of our friends died.

3395
02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:29.000
And then it was like, what are we going to go back to, to that same game of Russian roulette?

3396
02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.40
You know, we just didn't know each other anymore.

3397
02:40:32.40 --> 02:40:35.000
And it was very uncomfortable to be in the house.

3398
02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.24
He was learning how to be around the kids.

3399
02:40:37.24 --> 02:40:39.60
The kids were very uncomfortable.

3400
02:40:39.60 --> 02:40:42.40
Like how does dad fit back into this dynamic?

3401
02:40:42.40 --> 02:40:47.72
And so we thought like at the time, we know dysfunction, we know deployments, we know

3402
02:40:47.72 --> 02:40:50.16
not being together.

3403
02:40:50.16 --> 02:40:51.80
We don't know how to be a normal family.

3404
02:40:51.80 --> 02:40:54.12
I don't know what families do on the weekends.

3405
02:40:54.12 --> 02:40:59.88
I don't know how a family spends a Friday night, but I know how to be a single mom.

3406
02:40:59.88 --> 02:41:06.76
And so rushing back into that dysfunction was the safest thing at the time, which was replaced

3407
02:41:06.76 --> 02:41:14.24
by a big fat reality slap of, oh, extortion just happened.

3408
02:41:14.24 --> 02:41:15.92
We're going to go back to the Russian roulette.

3409
02:41:15.92 --> 02:41:17.16
Do we really want to do that?

3410
02:41:17.16 --> 02:41:22.84
And so that's at that point, he decided, let me just get out of the military altogether.

3411
02:41:22.84 --> 02:41:24.76
No, you missed a whole bunch.

3412
02:41:24.76 --> 02:41:25.76
Oh, my turn.

3413
02:41:25.76 --> 02:41:27.16
You missed, you missed something.

3414
02:41:27.16 --> 02:41:28.16
What?

3415
02:41:28.16 --> 02:41:31.88
Um, that's when I went to speak to OIC from SQT.

3416
02:41:31.88 --> 02:41:36.40
And I was like, Hey, I'm like, I'm not, you know, something not right.

3417
02:41:36.40 --> 02:41:37.40
Like I'm not doing well.

3418
02:41:37.40 --> 02:41:40.88
And he's like, why don't you go speak to the, I don't know, it was a West Coast dive medical

3419
02:41:40.88 --> 02:41:43.52
officer, whatever they call.

3420
02:41:43.52 --> 02:41:48.36
So I went over there and it was a psych and just started telling him about what's going

3421
02:41:48.36 --> 02:41:49.36
on.

3422
02:41:49.36 --> 02:41:54.32
And he said, Marcus, um, he said, first off, you're not, you're definitely not the only

3423
02:41:54.32 --> 02:41:55.32
one that's come in here.

3424
02:41:55.32 --> 02:41:59.16
He's like, matter of fact, he goes, I can't even count the number of guys that have come

3425
02:41:59.16 --> 02:42:01.80
in here now over the last couple months.

3426
02:42:01.80 --> 02:42:05.32
Um, and they have literally given me the same exact story.

3427
02:42:05.32 --> 02:42:09.84
And he goes, I don't know what it is, but he's like, you guys are all experiencing the

3428
02:42:09.84 --> 02:42:10.84
same exact thing.

3429
02:42:10.84 --> 02:42:13.000
And he said, so this is what I'm going to do.

3430
02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:19.52
And I think he's, I think I got prescribed a, you know, a, uh, an SSRI, uh, or SNRI first

3431
02:42:19.52 --> 02:42:20.52
time.

3432
02:42:20.52 --> 02:42:24.44
And I guess that was supposed to stabilize mood.

3433
02:42:24.44 --> 02:42:28.84
And then I got sent to NICO and I came back with like four more medications from the NICO,

3434
02:42:28.84 --> 02:42:32.56
you know, the NICO clinic out in, which I thought was actually a pretty good place,

3435
02:42:32.56 --> 02:42:38.28
but they do a lot of, they do a lot of checking and giving you drugs and they don't do a whole

3436
02:42:38.28 --> 02:42:41.56
lot of, in my opinion, healing.

3437
02:42:41.56 --> 02:42:46.24
When you go and you tell this doctor, something's not right.

3438
02:42:46.24 --> 02:42:49.24
How do you describe something's not right?

3439
02:42:49.24 --> 02:42:50.76
Like what does that sound like?

3440
02:42:50.76 --> 02:42:54.04
Again, I'm looking at this from a perspective of, yeah, how do you help?

3441
02:42:54.04 --> 02:42:55.04
Yeah.

3442
02:42:55.04 --> 02:42:58.60
A first responder, a firefighter, a police officer or somebody in the military that's

3443
02:42:58.60 --> 02:43:03.60
that, what do you track in that they should be paying attention to?

3444
02:43:03.60 --> 02:43:07.44
I think the, one of the biggest is lack of motivation or like lack of purpose.

3445
02:43:07.44 --> 02:43:12.44
You feel like nothing matters anymore at all.

3446
02:43:12.44 --> 02:43:14.36
Like what am I doing this for?

3447
02:43:14.36 --> 02:43:15.36
Like I don't even care.

3448
02:43:15.36 --> 02:43:17.60
And you're like, well, what do you care about?

3449
02:43:17.60 --> 02:43:19.96
Well, I used to like to surf or work out.

3450
02:43:19.96 --> 02:43:24.92
I could give a shit about surfing or working out, or I used to like to go, you know, do

3451
02:43:24.92 --> 02:43:26.68
X, Y and Z.

3452
02:43:26.68 --> 02:43:27.68
I don't even.

3453
02:43:27.68 --> 02:43:29.60
I'm like, here, we'll give you two weeks to do that.

3454
02:43:29.60 --> 02:43:34.40
No, how about I just sit at my house and watch TV and drink bourbon?

3455
02:43:34.40 --> 02:43:37.000
Because I don't have to think about anything and I can numb myself.

3456
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.76
And so I would say to the people out there listening, you're going to start to see that

3457
02:43:42.76 --> 02:43:49.96
you're becoming less motivated to do things of things that you really enjoyed in the past.

3458
02:43:49.96 --> 02:43:52.60
And that's, I think, one of the biggest signs.

3459
02:43:52.60 --> 02:43:54.16
That right there is a telltale sign.

3460
02:43:54.16 --> 02:43:58.96
The stuff you really enjoyed doing when it comes to like a screeching halt, like go talk

3461
02:43:58.96 --> 02:44:01.40
to somebody for sure.

3462
02:44:01.40 --> 02:44:05.48
And I don't know if that's now depression kicking in, or now if you want to call it

3463
02:44:05.48 --> 02:44:09.92
like PTSD or anxiety, or like, you know, now we're getting into the science of it.

3464
02:44:09.92 --> 02:44:13.92
And I don't know also, like, is this a chemical thing?

3465
02:44:13.92 --> 02:44:19.000
Because right now that study that just came out said, it's not a chemical thing.

3466
02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:23.20
So now it's like, OK, well, what's going on in your life that you can't get out of bed

3467
02:44:23.20 --> 02:44:24.20
in the morning?

3468
02:44:24.20 --> 02:44:25.48
Like, you don't want to go to work.

3469
02:44:25.48 --> 02:44:27.56
You don't want to answer your text messages.

3470
02:44:27.56 --> 02:44:31.60
So it's really just like a lack of just like, like if you just like slumped your shoulders

3471
02:44:31.60 --> 02:44:36.12
down and just like not gave a fuck anymore, that's really the...

3472
02:44:36.12 --> 02:44:39.56
There was also a lot of anger, irritability.

3473
02:44:39.56 --> 02:44:41.92
I think those are all things that are part of it.

3474
02:44:41.92 --> 02:44:47.04
So like you become this person that doesn't want to do anything and then you do snap or

3475
02:44:47.04 --> 02:44:53.24
you throw mugs through the window or you choke out the bartender at the country club, you

3476
02:44:53.24 --> 02:44:55.76
know, and stupid shit that...

3477
02:44:55.76 --> 02:44:58.28
All these things have happened by the way.

3478
02:44:58.28 --> 02:45:00.44
That you probably shouldn't be doing.

3479
02:45:00.44 --> 02:45:10.72
There's like a weird, I don't know if that's the wrong word, but when you're living your

3480
02:45:10.72 --> 02:45:16.16
life and everything's like you're saying you got goals, you got things that you want to

3481
02:45:16.16 --> 02:45:27.20
do and you got a long term vision and you got kids and when people die that you know

3482
02:45:27.20 --> 02:45:39.12
that are your friends and then there's this like, there's this thing of like, well, they're

3483
02:45:39.12 --> 02:45:45.96
gone and the world is still going.

3484
02:45:45.96 --> 02:45:55.92
And what is any of this shit mean of, oh, my friend was this awesome guy and now he's

3485
02:45:55.92 --> 02:46:04.64
dead and where I'm still going to morning muster, what is...

3486
02:46:04.64 --> 02:46:06.88
What are we doing here?

3487
02:46:06.88 --> 02:46:13.28
I think that sort of thing, you know, because you start getting like an existential thought

3488
02:46:13.28 --> 02:46:18.76
of this life is the most important thing, but now, oh, you lost a bunch of friends and

3489
02:46:18.76 --> 02:46:22.40
we're still here and we're going on, but we're going to end up where they are and this is

3490
02:46:22.40 --> 02:46:23.76
the way things are going.

3491
02:46:23.76 --> 02:46:26.88
It's like, seems like that could lead to...

3492
02:46:26.88 --> 02:46:30.76
Well, I might as well just watch TV.

3493
02:46:30.76 --> 02:46:32.56
I might as well just sit here and drink bourbon.

3494
02:46:32.56 --> 02:46:37.04
I might as well just do nothing because this is where we're heading.

3495
02:46:37.04 --> 02:46:39.20
This is where we're all heading.

3496
02:46:39.20 --> 02:46:47.000
I don't know, again, this is just like I'm thinking out loud as I'm hearing you describe

3497
02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:55.84
where your headspace was and especially when you're sort of get detached and you get put

3498
02:46:55.84 --> 02:46:59.52
into a different environment where you don't have the same friends and you don't have the

3499
02:46:59.52 --> 02:47:02.12
same like crew of families that you're with.

3500
02:47:02.12 --> 02:47:07.52
And, you know, one thing I can say about losing guys in combat was like, you lose guys in

3501
02:47:07.52 --> 02:47:11.60
combat and you're with all your friends and then you're going to go do more stuff in combat

3502
02:47:11.60 --> 02:47:13.28
and you don't really...

3503
02:47:13.28 --> 02:47:15.60
That feeling of what are we doing here?

3504
02:47:15.60 --> 02:47:17.000
Actually the opposite happens.

3505
02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.44
You now know why you're here.

3506
02:47:18.44 --> 02:47:21.000
Like we're going to go and we're going to make things happen.

3507
02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:22.32
We're going to go do our best.

3508
02:47:22.32 --> 02:47:23.32
We're going to stand tall.

3509
02:47:23.32 --> 02:47:26.04
Like you're going to go do all those things so it's sort of the opposite.

3510
02:47:26.04 --> 02:47:27.04
You get juiced up.

3511
02:47:27.04 --> 02:47:28.04
Yeah.

3512
02:47:28.04 --> 02:47:29.20
No, I think you get fired up.

3513
02:47:29.20 --> 02:47:34.04
Like you want to go do that 100% in the environment you're talking about without a doubt.

3514
02:47:34.04 --> 02:47:38.40
I mean, like I said, after that, he went down, like we couldn't even...

3515
02:47:38.40 --> 02:47:40.96
We were screaming, why are we still sitting here?

3516
02:47:40.96 --> 02:47:48.08
Why in the helicopter land right next to us put us on there and send us over there to

3517
02:47:48.08 --> 02:47:50.08
go get redemption?

3518
02:47:50.08 --> 02:47:55.000
And then when you don't have that outlet anymore and then you're looking around and you're

3519
02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.88
saying like, well, why am I even going to get out of bed this morning?

3520
02:48:00.88 --> 02:48:01.88
Yeah.

3521
02:48:01.88 --> 02:48:06.08
I think what you're describing, someone told me once and I kind of laugh at it, but it

3522
02:48:06.08 --> 02:48:07.08
makes sense.

3523
02:48:07.08 --> 02:48:08.08
He's like, Marcus, I'm not sure.

3524
02:48:08.08 --> 02:48:12.20
He's like, he's like, definitely, definitely dudes have this PTSD, but he's like, I think

3525
02:48:12.20 --> 02:48:16.28
they have what they call LSD, lack of...

3526
02:48:16.28 --> 02:48:17.28
LSD.

3527
02:48:17.28 --> 02:48:20.72
Yeah, lack of stress disorder.

3528
02:48:20.72 --> 02:48:22.60
He's like, I feel like we have to be in chaos.

3529
02:48:22.60 --> 02:48:26.56
And once that chaos stops is when our shit like unravels.

3530
02:48:26.56 --> 02:48:28.96
And I said, I get that.

3531
02:48:28.96 --> 02:48:33.52
And I said, I feel that they're definitely that's part of it, but there's got to be part

3532
02:48:33.52 --> 02:48:34.52
of something else.

3533
02:48:34.52 --> 02:48:38.68
Like why is everyone and not everyone, but why are there so many experiencing the same

3534
02:48:38.68 --> 02:48:39.68
exact thing?

3535
02:48:39.68 --> 02:48:41.68
You know, I don't never tell you that.

3536
02:48:41.68 --> 02:48:47.64
And I'll still to this day sometimes fight it that, you know, like you, I loved going

3537
02:48:47.64 --> 02:48:48.64
overseas.

3538
02:48:48.64 --> 02:48:49.64
I loved going to war.

3539
02:48:49.64 --> 02:48:50.64
I think that stuff is great.

3540
02:48:50.64 --> 02:48:53.88
And I think it makes you grow.

3541
02:48:53.88 --> 02:48:57.08
Like it makes you better.

3542
02:48:57.08 --> 02:49:02.04
You know, maybe it was some stuff that happened younger, then maybe some wartime stuff, then

3543
02:49:02.04 --> 02:49:06.72
maybe some transition stuff, like you said, like where I wasn't around some people, and

3544
02:49:06.72 --> 02:49:09.44
then maybe some of the family stuff that wasn't working.

3545
02:49:09.44 --> 02:49:13.12
And then maybe the concoction of all these fucking medications that they put me on and

3546
02:49:13.12 --> 02:49:14.72
say, you're going to get better if you take this.

3547
02:49:14.72 --> 02:49:16.72
And I'm going to believe you because you're a doctor.

3548
02:49:16.72 --> 02:49:19.20
You're telling me this is going to be good.

3549
02:49:19.20 --> 02:49:21.96
You know, then you get out and then you're in the private sector, then you don't have

3550
02:49:21.96 --> 02:49:25.12
any of that at all.

3551
02:49:25.12 --> 02:49:29.64
So maybe just all that together is a recipe for it's a perfect storm.

3552
02:49:29.64 --> 02:49:32.52
We found ourselves right in the middle of a perfect storm.

3553
02:49:32.52 --> 02:49:37.52
I have never taken any like drugs or anything.

3554
02:49:37.52 --> 02:49:38.52
Don't.

3555
02:49:38.52 --> 02:49:39.52
Yeah.

3556
02:49:39.52 --> 02:49:44.000
Like so, so even when I hear that and I, but I've, I've, you know, there's been a bunch

3557
02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:49.56
of data and information about them, what they're like and what they do.

3558
02:49:49.56 --> 02:49:54.44
And, you know, people, you get on all these, what are they called psychosomatic drugs?

3559
02:49:54.44 --> 02:49:55.44
Is that what they are?

3560
02:49:55.44 --> 02:49:58.72
They're, I mean, there's a, yeah, there's a bunch of them.

3561
02:49:58.72 --> 02:50:01.40
Some are supposed to like help you release some serotonin.

3562
02:50:01.40 --> 02:50:06.32
So you're like happier and others are supposed to like stabilize your mood, you know, but

3563
02:50:06.32 --> 02:50:10.28
then the problem is once you start taking those, then I don't know, all of a sudden you're

3564
02:50:10.28 --> 02:50:12.12
feeling a little tired or you can't focus.

3565
02:50:12.12 --> 02:50:15.88
So now they give you some provigil, a new vigil so you can focus.

3566
02:50:15.88 --> 02:50:17.92
But now those medicines are causing migraines.

3567
02:50:17.92 --> 02:50:20.04
And I'm like, yeah, I can't sleep now.

3568
02:50:20.04 --> 02:50:21.80
So like, oh, here you ever heard of Ambien?

3569
02:50:21.80 --> 02:50:26.48
And I'm like, yeah, it was on him for six years while I was deploying, but no, you need

3570
02:50:26.48 --> 02:50:27.96
this or maybe we won't give you Ambien.

3571
02:50:27.96 --> 02:50:33.76
We'll give you the other one that's not as like, it's just a, as a constant cycle.

3572
02:50:33.76 --> 02:50:37.88
He did, he was on no prescriptions until the year that he was getting out of the Navy.

3573
02:50:37.88 --> 02:50:44.08
And like between that time and, you know, a couple of years after, he had 10 prescriptions.

3574
02:50:44.08 --> 02:50:45.88
He's on zero today.

3575
02:50:45.88 --> 02:50:49.32
And Amber, I got prescribed my first at, at NICO.

3576
02:50:49.32 --> 02:50:50.32
I know that's the year.

3577
02:50:50.32 --> 02:50:51.72
No, no, from the, from the, from the site.

3578
02:50:51.72 --> 02:50:55.16
And then from NICO, they prescribed me four medications because I was just looking at my

3579
02:50:55.16 --> 02:50:56.16
medical record.

3580
02:50:56.16 --> 02:50:57.16
It's crazy.

3581
02:50:57.16 --> 02:50:58.16
It's crazy.

3582
02:50:58.16 --> 02:51:01.48
And then once we went into all this, I think it was on seven and we get on average, you

3583
02:51:01.48 --> 02:51:03.96
know, what we're doing on the nonprofit.

3584
02:51:03.96 --> 02:51:07.88
The average is seven to eight medications at one time.

3585
02:51:07.88 --> 02:51:08.88
We have people coming to us.

3586
02:51:08.88 --> 02:51:11.98
These are team guys over 20 medications that they're on.

3587
02:51:11.98 --> 02:51:14.84
Not that they're like, Hey, I want to be on this, that they're being prescribed.

3588
02:51:14.84 --> 02:51:16.44
Say, here you're a fucked up.

3589
02:51:16.44 --> 02:51:17.64
Like you should take these.

3590
02:51:17.64 --> 02:51:20.40
Like who prescribed somebody over 20 medications?

3591
02:51:20.40 --> 02:51:21.40
That's like, he seems completely insane.

3592
02:51:21.40 --> 02:51:22.40
Insane to me.

3593
02:51:22.40 --> 02:51:23.40
It's insane.

3594
02:51:23.40 --> 02:51:28.16
And you know, no, look, I have friends that are psychologists and they've explained to

3595
02:51:28.16 --> 02:51:29.68
me that there's like certain things.

3596
02:51:29.68 --> 02:51:32.76
Like there's certain times that certain people need certain things and like it really helps

3597
02:51:32.76 --> 02:51:34.36
them.

3598
02:51:34.36 --> 02:51:40.56
But um, damn, like seven prescriptions for some stuff that makes you stay awake and

3599
02:51:40.56 --> 02:51:44.16
focused and then give you something else that's going to make you sleep.

3600
02:51:44.16 --> 02:51:48.60
I'm not a rocket scientist or a psychologist, my damn self, but that doesn't seem like a

3601
02:51:48.60 --> 02:51:49.60
great thing.

3602
02:51:49.60 --> 02:51:50.60
Yeah.

3603
02:51:50.60 --> 02:51:51.60
Probably.

3604
02:51:51.60 --> 02:51:52.60
It's the go to.

3605
02:51:52.60 --> 02:51:56.88
It's the number one tool in the toolbox, at least if you are being treated by military

3606
02:51:56.88 --> 02:52:03.76
medicine or the VA, if you can't write a prescription for it or talk to a therapist about it, they

3607
02:52:03.76 --> 02:52:04.76
got nothing for you.

3608
02:52:04.76 --> 02:52:08.56
I think the best research I came out recently is that they said, uh, if you get your heart

3609
02:52:08.56 --> 02:52:12.20
rate up, go for a run, go on the mat.

3610
02:52:12.20 --> 02:52:15.20
The actual research is showing that that's better than this.

3611
02:52:15.20 --> 02:52:18.04
These antidepressants that they've been getting us for 35 years.

3612
02:52:18.04 --> 02:52:21.64
And that's why I think now these antidepressants are like, there's a lot of bad shit coming

3613
02:52:21.64 --> 02:52:22.64
out about them.

3614
02:52:22.64 --> 02:52:26.20
Like there's no, like every press you read about them now is, is not good.

3615
02:52:26.20 --> 02:52:28.72
So I think they're slowly going away.

3616
02:52:28.72 --> 02:52:29.72
Yeah.

3617
02:52:29.72 --> 02:52:34.12
Well, I never stopped working out and never stopped training Jiu-Jitsu.

3618
02:52:34.12 --> 02:52:36.72
Like maybe that's, maybe that's it, dude.

3619
02:52:36.72 --> 02:52:37.72
I don't know.

3620
02:52:37.72 --> 02:52:42.96
Probably the best thing, at least I understand you can do, but I still think not for everybody,

3621
02:52:42.96 --> 02:52:43.96
right?

3622
02:52:43.96 --> 02:52:46.32
So I still think there's certain individuals that probably need something.

3623
02:52:46.32 --> 02:52:47.32
Yeah.

3624
02:52:47.32 --> 02:52:51.08
And you know, when they just came out and said, Hey, going for a run, getting your heart

3625
02:52:51.08 --> 02:52:56.60
rate up is better than these, like we should, we should take, we should take that on board.

3626
02:52:56.60 --> 02:52:59.80
Cause like most of America is sitting in front of the computer for 12 hours a day.

3627
02:52:59.80 --> 02:53:04.52
They're wondering why, you know, they're angry or they're depressed, you know, just a little

3628
02:53:04.52 --> 02:53:09.000
bit of, uh, you know, heart rate, heart rate increase activity.

3629
02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.68
You help that out.

3630
02:53:10.68 --> 02:53:12.84
And you throw booze into the mix, right?

3631
02:53:12.84 --> 02:53:15.32
Cause like how good is that for you?

3632
02:53:15.32 --> 02:53:21.88
It got seven meds, nine meds, 12 meds, and you're drinking like, and not working out

3633
02:53:21.88 --> 02:53:24.68
as much.

3634
02:53:24.68 --> 02:53:29.28
So you, you decide that you're going to get out.

3635
02:53:29.28 --> 02:53:30.28
And how many years did you have?

3636
02:53:30.28 --> 02:53:35.32
And at this point, 12, 12, and you decide, all right, I'm going to go do something else.

3637
02:53:35.32 --> 02:53:37.76
I'm like, I just want to run away at that point.

3638
02:53:37.76 --> 02:53:40.60
I literally just wanted to run.

3639
02:53:40.60 --> 02:53:43.76
Yeah.

3640
02:53:43.76 --> 02:53:45.64
And what do you think in Amber?

3641
02:53:45.64 --> 02:53:51.72
Well, I should have learned from OCS that big dramatic changes are probably not the

3642
02:53:51.72 --> 02:53:58.04
best, but at the time I thought, I don't want to go back to the Russian roulette.

3643
02:53:58.04 --> 02:54:03.20
And I know Marcus needs a goal and he probably feels like, you know, leaving the command

3644
02:54:03.20 --> 02:54:09.36
and becoming an instructor is going, you know, not necessarily going in a goal oriented direction.

3645
02:54:09.36 --> 02:54:13.96
So maybe having a career is the next best goal he just graduated.

3646
02:54:13.96 --> 02:54:20.36
He had, he got his master's degree and I went with it.

3647
02:54:20.36 --> 02:54:23.96
Dude, only a freaking team guy could be going like on all these drugs and drinking and still

3648
02:54:23.96 --> 02:54:25.76
get their master's degree.

3649
02:54:25.76 --> 02:54:27.000
That's so retarded.

3650
02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.92
It's like, that's so ridiculous.

3651
02:54:28.92 --> 02:54:31.12
I saw people, I was the best when I wasn't thinking.

3652
02:54:31.12 --> 02:54:34.28
Like if I could just go, if you could just wind me up and go, I'm fine.

3653
02:54:34.28 --> 02:54:39.28
But as soon as I stopped for half a second is when the chicken's tumbling down.

3654
02:54:39.28 --> 02:54:47.60
So little did I know that I was actually like stepping into like the, you know, perfect,

3655
02:54:47.60 --> 02:54:48.72
perfect storm.

3656
02:54:48.72 --> 02:54:55.64
We were living in a pretty bad one, but the perfect storm was childhood trauma, war trauma,

3657
02:54:55.64 --> 02:55:01.76
head trauma, transition trauma, family trauma, loss of purpose, loss of paycheck, loss of

3658
02:55:01.76 --> 02:55:05.68
community, loss of identity.

3659
02:55:05.68 --> 02:55:11.08
And he wanted to get so far away from the military and the teams that he went into

3660
02:55:11.08 --> 02:55:12.08
banking.

3661
02:55:12.08 --> 02:55:16.52
What was, what was pushing you away from the freaking teams?

3662
02:55:16.52 --> 02:55:19.12
I, no idea.

3663
02:55:19.12 --> 02:55:20.12
No clue.

3664
02:55:20.12 --> 02:55:21.12
If I had to guess.

3665
02:55:21.12 --> 02:55:23.84
Anger, just anger, like anger at, and probably wasn't the teams.

3666
02:55:23.84 --> 02:55:26.000
It was just anger of like everything.

3667
02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.72
Because you know what it's like when you like see one of your team guy friends that you

3668
02:55:31.72 --> 02:55:34.08
haven't seen in a while and you're just super stoked.

3669
02:55:34.08 --> 02:55:37.04
Like I remember I got back from my last balloon was we're going to trade at dude.

3670
02:55:37.04 --> 02:55:40.52
I worked at trade at, you know, so there's different team guys come every day was like

3671
02:55:40.52 --> 02:55:41.84
a reunion every day.

3672
02:55:41.84 --> 02:55:46.64
Like, yeah, just like, oh, hey, we go, what's your, like every day was like that.

3673
02:55:46.64 --> 02:55:51.36
I mean, my freaking kids will say to me, my oldest daughter right now, she'll say to me,

3674
02:55:51.36 --> 02:55:53.24
like, why don't you just go back in?

3675
02:55:53.24 --> 02:55:56.80
I'm always like, well, I can't really go back in.

3676
02:55:56.80 --> 02:55:58.68
I'm like an old guy now.

3677
02:55:58.68 --> 02:56:00.88
Why don't you just go back in?

3678
02:56:00.88 --> 02:56:03.68
So what was that just not there anymore?

3679
02:56:03.68 --> 02:56:07.60
Were you feeling like, you know, you see your friends and you're like, I don't.

3680
02:56:07.60 --> 02:56:08.84
Yeah, I don't care.

3681
02:56:08.84 --> 02:56:09.84
I don't care.

3682
02:56:09.84 --> 02:56:14.52
Yeah, it was just, you know, Jacque was just like a.

3683
02:56:14.52 --> 02:56:18.08
I don't know how to describe it was completely numb inside.

3684
02:56:18.08 --> 02:56:19.60
He feels like that now.

3685
02:56:19.60 --> 02:56:20.60
That's what I'm saying.

3686
02:56:20.60 --> 02:56:22.48
It was a period of time when the healer went down.

3687
02:56:22.48 --> 02:56:26.92
Like I had this weird conversation with the Admiral was just like, I'm numb.

3688
02:56:26.92 --> 02:56:28.32
This is not even affecting me anymore.

3689
02:56:28.32 --> 02:56:29.32
Like I don't get it.

3690
02:56:29.32 --> 02:56:30.64
He's like, yeah, but this hurts.

3691
02:56:30.64 --> 02:56:35.16
I'm like, yeah, it hurts, but I'm, I just don't, it's not even registering.

3692
02:56:35.16 --> 02:56:36.16
It's just.

3693
02:56:36.16 --> 02:56:40.52
So this is, this is when we see like there's something like to me now, like, okay, there's

3694
02:56:40.52 --> 02:56:42.40
something, there's something wrong.

3695
02:56:42.40 --> 02:56:43.84
There's something going on in here.

3696
02:56:43.84 --> 02:56:51.88
Like for a team guy to, to not like be kind of stoked to see their friends.

3697
02:56:51.88 --> 02:56:53.84
Like I just remember my whole life.

3698
02:56:53.84 --> 02:56:55.36
I would go to work and just be stoked.

3699
02:56:55.36 --> 02:56:58.76
Like there's never a day where I was like, I'm bummed out to go to work today.

3700
02:56:58.76 --> 02:57:04.36
Every day was just awesome and fun and going to see my friends and we're going to hang

3701
02:57:04.36 --> 02:57:05.80
out and we're going to shoot some shit.

3702
02:57:05.80 --> 02:57:11.40
And like, thank God I always had that feeling, you know, I always had that feeling.

3703
02:57:11.40 --> 02:57:17.92
So this is what tells me like, again, going back to Chad and hearing Sarah describe this

3704
02:57:17.92 --> 02:57:26.72
change in his personality, you know, and that's where I, the only thing that I could imagine

3705
02:57:26.72 --> 02:57:27.72
that could cause.

3706
02:57:27.72 --> 02:57:34.60
Like, like it has to be something else that's causing you to get in this mode of, you know,

3707
02:57:34.60 --> 02:57:40.04
oh, there's freaking four guys that I haven't seen in five years and I went to Bud's with

3708
02:57:40.04 --> 02:57:42.72
them or I was at a platoon with them or whatever.

3709
02:57:42.72 --> 02:57:44.52
I think you would, someone would have been like that though.

3710
02:57:44.52 --> 02:57:46.56
Yeah, but I also used to want to run high too.

3711
02:57:46.56 --> 02:57:47.56
Remember that?

3712
02:57:47.56 --> 02:57:49.64
Like I never wanted to go back to Virginia Beach.

3713
02:57:49.64 --> 02:57:50.64
Oh, well, that's true.

3714
02:57:50.64 --> 02:57:52.52
I didn't want to see anybody.

3715
02:57:52.52 --> 02:58:00.24
But also like, you know, he sort of had, he was at this pinnacle of what he wanted for

3716
02:58:00.24 --> 02:58:02.52
his career and the teams.

3717
02:58:02.52 --> 02:58:08.32
And so to leave that and go to a new place was hard, you know, it would be like transferring

3718
02:58:08.32 --> 02:58:13.96
coasts for anybody when you're making all new friends or being out here.

3719
02:58:13.96 --> 02:58:16.44
The vibe, I mean, obviously we love it here.

3720
02:58:16.44 --> 02:58:18.44
We're here now.

3721
02:58:18.44 --> 02:58:22.56
But the vibe here versus the East Coast was very different and that people are a lot more

3722
02:58:22.56 --> 02:58:23.96
spread out here.

3723
02:58:23.96 --> 02:58:29.72
So we were by ourselves in a neighborhood far away from other military families.

3724
02:58:29.72 --> 02:58:33.44
And we just didn't feel like people really got it.

3725
02:58:33.44 --> 02:58:40.36
And so I think that he got to this place of being so numb and not really caring after

3726
02:58:40.36 --> 02:58:41.36
the transition.

3727
02:58:41.36 --> 02:58:44.16
But it was very hard to go back to Virginia Beach.

3728
02:58:44.16 --> 02:58:48.24
But I hear you now because like we live in Coronado and I love it because I get to see

3729
02:58:48.24 --> 02:58:52.84
my bros, like guys that are contractors, they come in like, Hey, what's going on?

3730
02:58:52.84 --> 02:58:54.000
You know, so it's good.

3731
02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:55.20
Now it's, but now it's different.

3732
02:58:55.20 --> 02:58:56.52
I mean, I'd say different places.

3733
02:58:56.52 --> 02:59:01.44
I guess the thing that I'm trying to say is like you can, it's like the freaking check

3734
02:59:01.44 --> 02:59:02.88
engine light in a car.

3735
02:59:02.88 --> 02:59:09.000
Like to me, that's a check engine light in the car of like just about every team guy

3736
02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:13.000
you know, like when they see other team guys, they're stoked.

3737
02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:20.36
I remember one of my buddies was stationed up in, up in Germany in North Germany with

3738
02:59:20.36 --> 02:59:21.36
the Comsformers.

3739
02:59:21.36 --> 02:59:23.08
He was up there.

3740
02:59:23.08 --> 02:59:25.52
He was up there for three years.

3741
02:59:25.52 --> 02:59:31.000
And I went up to see him one time when I was in Germany and like he was, cause he'd been

3742
02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:35.64
to not, he'd be these were round kick ass, bad ass Comsformer guys, which is awesome.

3743
02:59:35.64 --> 02:59:36.64
And they're great.

3744
02:59:36.64 --> 02:59:38.14
They're studs.

3745
02:59:38.14 --> 02:59:42.20
And but man, when he saw me, it was like he was, he couldn't stop smiling.

3746
02:59:42.20 --> 02:59:44.84
Bro, I was like, bro, you're so happy.

3747
02:59:44.84 --> 02:59:45.84
He goes, bro, it's so good.

3748
02:59:45.84 --> 02:59:48.60
He goes, it's so good to see you and it's so good to speak English.

3749
02:59:48.60 --> 02:59:51.08
He's speaking German.

3750
02:59:51.08 --> 02:59:57.80
So for me to like sit here and think about that, I'm thinking there must be like some,

3751
02:59:57.80 --> 02:59:59.80
there's something wrong with the engine.

3752
02:59:59.80 --> 03:00:02.48
Like there's a check, that's a check engine light.

3753
03:00:02.48 --> 03:00:06.48
The real check engine light is coming on.

3754
03:00:06.48 --> 03:00:11.20
And, and, and then you tell me all these other things like that list, you just rattled off

3755
03:00:11.20 --> 03:00:13.16
of all these things that are going on Amber.

3756
03:00:13.16 --> 03:00:18.28
You're like, Oh, loss of this, loss of that, change of this, change of this, you know.

3757
03:00:18.28 --> 03:00:21.12
Yeah, you can't outrun it.

3758
03:00:21.12 --> 03:00:28.76
Whenever you're processed out and you're a civilian, it all comes crashing down for

3759
03:00:28.76 --> 03:00:29.88
so many.

3760
03:00:29.88 --> 03:00:35.96
And we were one of, one of those cases where we couldn't outrun it anymore.

3761
03:00:35.96 --> 03:00:37.88
And yeah, I mean, if you're good, you're good.

3762
03:00:37.88 --> 03:00:42.92
So, you know, you, I think if you get out and everything is tracking and there's no

3763
03:00:42.92 --> 03:00:49.48
check engine light and you maybe go through some transition, whatever, but you're fine.

3764
03:00:49.48 --> 03:00:51.56
But if you're not, you know, I like that.

3765
03:00:51.56 --> 03:00:52.56
I like that analogy.

3766
03:00:52.56 --> 03:00:53.56
I may use that.

3767
03:00:53.56 --> 03:00:54.56
And we'll steal that from you.

3768
03:00:54.56 --> 03:00:55.56
You can.

3769
03:00:55.56 --> 03:00:56.56
Yeah, of course.

3770
03:00:56.56 --> 03:01:00.40
You can all, Sarah describes Chad as like a light going out.

3771
03:01:00.40 --> 03:01:05.40
And I certainly would have described Marcus the same, like the light in him completely

3772
03:01:05.40 --> 03:01:14.28
went out and, um, but over time, you just start to like sort of like justify it or rationalize

3773
03:01:14.28 --> 03:01:15.28
it in your head.

3774
03:01:15.28 --> 03:01:18.72
Like, well, like, I mean, I guess that's how things are now.

3775
03:01:18.72 --> 03:01:20.88
And they're kind of all like that.

3776
03:01:20.88 --> 03:01:26.32
And, you know, just, you just rationalize it and you try to handle it.

3777
03:01:26.32 --> 03:01:33.56
But like the level of suffering that you guys can endure is so great.

3778
03:01:33.56 --> 03:01:34.56
It's terrifying.

3779
03:01:34.56 --> 03:01:37.92
So this is how you get a dude that's like going through all this and getting his master's

3780
03:01:37.92 --> 03:01:38.92
degree.

3781
03:01:38.92 --> 03:01:42.40
Like that's such a good example of I'll just suck it up.

3782
03:01:42.40 --> 03:01:45.64
Like I'll just suck it up and just do this stupid assignment.

3783
03:01:45.64 --> 03:01:47.20
You know, you're a grown ass man.

3784
03:01:47.20 --> 03:01:50.40
You're getting told by someone to write a paper and you're like, cool, give me the freaking

3785
03:01:50.40 --> 03:01:52.48
computer with rock and roll.

3786
03:01:52.48 --> 03:01:53.48
Yeah.

3787
03:01:53.48 --> 03:01:54.48
Yeah.

3788
03:01:54.48 --> 03:01:57.08
So, um, so you decided you're going to get out.

3789
03:01:57.08 --> 03:01:58.16
What kind of plan do you have?

3790
03:01:58.16 --> 03:02:00.52
Like where are you going to get money from?

3791
03:02:00.52 --> 03:02:01.52
Did you already get a job?

3792
03:02:01.52 --> 03:02:02.52
Did you get a job lined up?

3793
03:02:02.52 --> 03:02:04.16
No, no, I got, I mean, I was, yes.

3794
03:02:04.16 --> 03:02:05.16
So I was lucky enough.

3795
03:02:05.16 --> 03:02:10.24
I had, um, I had a mentor and, you know, and the mentor connected me to some folks.

3796
03:02:10.24 --> 03:02:15.32
And so I did like a New York City tour, met a lot of different people that met a lot of

3797
03:02:15.32 --> 03:02:17.04
people in banking and some other stuff.

3798
03:02:17.04 --> 03:02:22.36
And then got introduced to a lot of West Coast folks and just kind of went out there and

3799
03:02:22.36 --> 03:02:24.04
figured out what's next.

3800
03:02:24.04 --> 03:02:29.52
So I, you know, I consider myself lucky there, um, that I got to, I got to meet a lot of

3801
03:02:29.52 --> 03:02:32.08
people and kind of figure out what I wanted to do.

3802
03:02:32.08 --> 03:02:33.84
So I had a choice, really had a choice.

3803
03:02:33.84 --> 03:02:39.08
And so you got, you actually got a job lined up before you got out, which is freaking amazing

3804
03:02:39.08 --> 03:02:43.40
because sometimes guys don't realize that they get a paycheck every two weeks and that

3805
03:02:43.40 --> 03:02:46.12
when you get out, that paycheck stops.

3806
03:02:46.12 --> 03:02:50.000
And you know, like it's, it's a rough transition for a lot of dudes.

3807
03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:51.36
It could be very rough.

3808
03:02:51.36 --> 03:02:57.16
And so yeah, I was, yeah, I was lucky in that regard, um, you know, looking for something

3809
03:02:57.16 --> 03:02:58.16
else to do.

3810
03:02:58.16 --> 03:03:00.12
And I mean, I wasn't thinking any other way.

3811
03:03:00.12 --> 03:03:06.68
Again, like the way I'm thinking is I'm getting out to go do something, not to, I guess, figure

3812
03:03:06.68 --> 03:03:07.68
it out.

3813
03:03:07.68 --> 03:03:08.68
So.

3814
03:03:08.68 --> 03:03:09.68
And so what was the first gig?

3815
03:03:09.68 --> 03:03:10.68
You were a banker.

3816
03:03:10.68 --> 03:03:11.68
What was it?

3817
03:03:11.68 --> 03:03:17.84
It was a private banker, um, which is really like a fancy way of saying financial advisor.

3818
03:03:17.84 --> 03:03:23.84
And I had some people tell me, don't, don't do it unless you have a lot of rich friends.

3819
03:03:23.84 --> 03:03:26.44
Literally, I got told that by several people.

3820
03:03:26.44 --> 03:03:27.44
Like, really?

3821
03:03:27.44 --> 03:03:29.04
Is that how this works out here?

3822
03:03:29.04 --> 03:03:30.76
Um, but no, I got, I got lucky.

3823
03:03:30.76 --> 03:03:35.64
I worked for a really good team up in LA and, um, yeah, I did that for like a year.

3824
03:03:35.64 --> 03:03:36.64
Did you guys move to LA?

3825
03:03:36.64 --> 03:03:37.64
Yeah.

3826
03:03:37.64 --> 03:03:38.64
Yeah, that was terrible.

3827
03:03:38.64 --> 03:03:42.32
That's why I moved to Texas like within a year after moving there.

3828
03:03:42.32 --> 03:03:45.28
Were you still working at the bank when you moved to Texas?

3829
03:03:45.28 --> 03:03:47.04
No, no, I got hired somewhere else.

3830
03:03:47.04 --> 03:03:48.96
Um, again, through, through my mentor.

3831
03:03:48.96 --> 03:03:50.88
Um, doing the same kind of thing.

3832
03:03:50.88 --> 03:03:55.44
No, doing different stuff like operations now, just kind of more like leadership operations,

3833
03:03:55.44 --> 03:03:57.12
uh, business development.

3834
03:03:57.12 --> 03:03:58.88
And how's your head space at this point?

3835
03:03:58.88 --> 03:04:08.48
Um, I mean, I feel like it, it didn't really, I was like really excited to get out and do

3836
03:04:08.48 --> 03:04:09.96
something different, but I'm not sure.

3837
03:04:09.96 --> 03:04:11.48
He was in a holding pattern at that time.

3838
03:04:11.48 --> 03:04:16.24
I think that there was enough, you had enough tasks to get done and another.

3839
03:04:16.24 --> 03:04:19.80
Yeah, yeah, I was also, and I had something that like I was, there was like excitement.

3840
03:04:19.80 --> 03:04:20.80
Yeah.

3841
03:04:20.80 --> 03:04:21.80
Yeah.

3842
03:04:21.80 --> 03:04:28.84
And I didn't mind LA, but I certainly, you know, we were so disconnected.

3843
03:04:28.84 --> 03:04:31.88
And, um, it was, it was a challenge.

3844
03:04:31.88 --> 03:04:33.92
Like our relationship was a challenge.

3845
03:04:33.92 --> 03:04:36.52
His relationship with the kids was a challenge.

3846
03:04:36.52 --> 03:04:38.44
He drinking was still an issue.

3847
03:04:38.44 --> 03:04:41.12
I was, I was still in the, I was still in the meds, obviously.

3848
03:04:41.12 --> 03:04:42.96
So I was on the meds for seven years straight.

3849
03:04:42.96 --> 03:04:45.44
And by the way, you, you were incorrect.

3850
03:04:45.44 --> 03:04:48.32
I got prescribed while I was still on active duty.

3851
03:04:48.32 --> 03:04:53.96
So from active duty till 2017, November 11th is when I was on.

3852
03:04:53.96 --> 03:05:01.000
So I just meant that like right before you got out of the military is you went your whole

3853
03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.28
career, not on meds.

3854
03:05:03.28 --> 03:05:06.40
Like even when he would get injured, he'd be like, I'm not taking that.

3855
03:05:06.40 --> 03:05:09.88
And then, you know, finally relented in like his last year of service.

3856
03:05:09.88 --> 03:05:15.48
And then from that point forward, he was prescribed more and more and more.

3857
03:05:15.48 --> 03:05:18.64
But you know, things were really still deteriorating at home.

3858
03:05:18.64 --> 03:05:24.40
And I remember thinking I can't be stuck in California, like as a single mom.

3859
03:05:24.40 --> 03:05:30.24
My dad had just taken a job at the University of Texas, his offensive coordinator there.

3860
03:05:30.24 --> 03:05:32.80
And Marcus was working in North Carolina commuting.

3861
03:05:32.80 --> 03:05:38.60
And so at one point he came home and he's like, why are paying California taxes?

3862
03:05:38.60 --> 03:05:41.24
I don't even work in the state.

3863
03:05:41.24 --> 03:05:43.36
And we decided to move to Texas.

3864
03:05:43.36 --> 03:05:48.56
And I just thought this is going to be a great place for me to raise the kids and just feel

3865
03:05:48.56 --> 03:05:52.000
better about the kids being raised in a place like Texas.

3866
03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:56.20
And I can probably afford it more than California because I thought we were done.

3867
03:05:56.20 --> 03:06:01.24
I didn't want to be done, but I just thought this is, this is not working.

3868
03:06:01.24 --> 03:06:04.20
So from your perspective, as you're saying, raise the kids, you think that you're going

3869
03:06:04.20 --> 03:06:06.76
to be raising alone because it's that bad.

3870
03:06:06.76 --> 03:06:16.28
Well, it was just, you know, my dreams of my feeling of support for his job in the early

3871
03:06:16.28 --> 03:06:23.52
days sort of turned to like indifference and feeling like resentment that the teams always

3872
03:06:23.52 --> 03:06:25.28
came first.

3873
03:06:25.28 --> 03:06:31.32
I never gave him an ultimatum or anything like that, but it was this sort of like pride

3874
03:06:31.32 --> 03:06:34.20
was replaced with pain.

3875
03:06:34.20 --> 03:06:38.36
And from there, I just kept thinking, well, maybe if we try this, I'll get the feeling

3876
03:06:38.36 --> 03:06:39.36
back.

3877
03:06:39.36 --> 03:06:40.64
Maybe if we try that, I'll get the feeling back.

3878
03:06:40.64 --> 03:06:42.12
Maybe moving will help my family.

3879
03:06:42.12 --> 03:06:43.68
Maybe getting out will help my family.

3880
03:06:43.68 --> 03:06:45.000
And nothing was helping.

3881
03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.36
It was actually just deteriorating.

3882
03:06:47.36 --> 03:06:52.000
And so I was basically losing hope that I would ever get the feeling back of like caring.

3883
03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:56.04
I did care, but I just knew that this isn't the way I wanted it.

3884
03:06:56.04 --> 03:06:58.08
This isn't a marriage I want to have.

3885
03:06:58.08 --> 03:07:01.12
And so it felt inevitable.

3886
03:07:01.12 --> 03:07:03.20
I thought at that point we would just divorce.

3887
03:07:03.20 --> 03:07:06.96
I wasn't afraid like anything bad would happen to him.

3888
03:07:06.96 --> 03:07:10.16
I just felt like this isn't workable.

3889
03:07:10.16 --> 03:07:12.84
And what are you feeling, Marcus?

3890
03:07:12.84 --> 03:07:13.84
At this point, you're moved.

3891
03:07:13.84 --> 03:07:15.40
You moved to Texas.

3892
03:07:15.40 --> 03:07:17.76
Is this where you're choking out country club people?

3893
03:07:17.76 --> 03:07:18.76
Yeah.

3894
03:07:18.76 --> 03:07:22.68
Yeah, Texas, it just got worse from there.

3895
03:07:22.68 --> 03:07:25.88
Nothing definitely got better.

3896
03:07:25.88 --> 03:07:27.44
It got worse.

3897
03:07:27.44 --> 03:07:28.84
I hated it there.

3898
03:07:28.84 --> 03:07:29.84
I needed the water.

3899
03:07:29.84 --> 03:07:30.84
I needed the mountains.

3900
03:07:30.84 --> 03:07:31.84
It was flat.

3901
03:07:31.84 --> 03:07:32.84
It was hot.

3902
03:07:32.84 --> 03:07:36.68
I didn't like the people, the town we lived.

3903
03:07:36.68 --> 03:07:40.000
I got along with a few people, but again, nobody got it.

3904
03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:43.96
I felt like it was in that space of nobody gets me.

3905
03:07:43.96 --> 03:07:50.04
And I've been in a war and I can't have a real conversation with anybody because the

3906
03:07:50.04 --> 03:07:55.12
only thing they care about is money.

3907
03:07:55.12 --> 03:07:57.36
I was just going through all of that.

3908
03:07:57.36 --> 03:08:02.80
And again, it wasn't like we were struggling in terms of financially or any of that.

3909
03:08:02.80 --> 03:08:06.36
Honestly, I could have made a million dollars a year.

3910
03:08:06.36 --> 03:08:07.36
Nothing would have changed.

3911
03:08:07.36 --> 03:08:11.12
It was just bad.

3912
03:08:11.12 --> 03:08:14.72
It was just was not, I don't know.

3913
03:08:14.72 --> 03:08:19.80
Again, I think I had less friends when we moved to Texas than I.

3914
03:08:19.80 --> 03:08:25.64
We joke about it, but I don't want to be too angry here over the radio.

3915
03:08:25.64 --> 03:08:27.68
Anybody's listening in?

3916
03:08:27.68 --> 03:08:30.04
Definitely a challenging time.

3917
03:08:30.04 --> 03:08:32.12
And that's when the wheels really came off for us.

3918
03:08:32.12 --> 03:08:38.76
I think that part of what has grounded Marcus has been his ability to get in the water and

3919
03:08:38.76 --> 03:08:39.92
travel.

3920
03:08:39.92 --> 03:08:44.48
And so, you know, in the Navy, you're always stationed near water and in the teams, you're

3921
03:08:44.48 --> 03:08:45.72
doing a lot of traveling.

3922
03:08:45.72 --> 03:08:51.76
And so when we were in Texas, he was basically stuck at home and it was 110 degrees outside

3923
03:08:51.76 --> 03:08:53.24
with no water.

3924
03:08:53.24 --> 03:08:55.08
And he tried to take up golf.

3925
03:08:55.08 --> 03:08:57.72
He's just got to have, you know, that outlet.

3926
03:08:57.72 --> 03:09:01.52
And in taking up golf, he started hanging out with a crew at the country club that were

3927
03:09:01.52 --> 03:09:03.92
very, very, very heavy drinkers.

3928
03:09:03.92 --> 03:09:05.48
And he started to drink.

3929
03:09:05.48 --> 03:09:10.32
Yeah, kind of fell back into the, I think I was drinking hard anyway.

3930
03:09:10.32 --> 03:09:11.32
I don't think it paid.

3931
03:09:11.32 --> 03:09:16.36
You were, but it certainly escalated to a point that, you know, I basically had to like sit

3932
03:09:16.36 --> 03:09:20.96
them down at one point and be like, listen, don't call my husband anymore, because this

3933
03:09:20.96 --> 03:09:23.000
is becoming a problem.

3934
03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:28.48
And it just, our son at that point was...

3935
03:09:28.48 --> 03:09:30.12
Yeah, then he started spiraling a little bit.

3936
03:09:30.12 --> 03:09:32.72
I think just because of what was going on at the house.

3937
03:09:32.72 --> 03:09:38.16
And so then, you know, we're dealing with him not being, you know, just like your typical

3938
03:09:38.16 --> 03:09:42.000
kid that can go to school and get good grades and come home and...

3939
03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:43.000
He's not doing that.

3940
03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.08
He's not doing that, you know.

3941
03:09:45.08 --> 03:09:49.68
And so a mix of a little bit of everything.

3942
03:09:49.68 --> 03:09:55.28
I think as it was at that time when, you know, Amber again started just like seeing more

3943
03:09:55.28 --> 03:09:56.28
changes.

3944
03:09:56.28 --> 03:09:59.000
And so she started getting me into brain clinics.

3945
03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:00.000
Yeah.

3946
03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:01.000
And it was actually...

3947
03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:02.000
So, you had 2000...

3948
03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:07.64
There was a former teammate of Marcus's who took his life as well, like one of the first

3949
03:10:07.64 --> 03:10:09.04
Sealed Suicides.

3950
03:10:09.04 --> 03:10:16.24
And his wife actually did a two-part series and the Virginia pilot over Memorial Day.

3951
03:10:16.24 --> 03:10:20.44
And that was in 2016, I believe.

3952
03:10:20.44 --> 03:10:25.40
And I read this article about him and she described him as the light going out.

3953
03:10:25.40 --> 03:10:28.000
And she described all these struggles that he was having.

3954
03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.84
And I was like, hold on, this is what we're going through.

3955
03:10:31.84 --> 03:10:34.48
No one's talking about this, though.

3956
03:10:34.48 --> 03:10:38.000
And it was the first time that someone had like had the courage to say that they were

3957
03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.32
struggling and had so much respect for that.

3958
03:10:40.32 --> 03:10:42.20
And I was also scared to show this.

3959
03:10:42.20 --> 03:10:48.88
And so what the article basically ended by saying was that there was a pattern of scarring

3960
03:10:48.88 --> 03:10:52.16
found in his brain linked to blast exposure.

3961
03:10:52.16 --> 03:10:55.24
And there was also some mention of CTE.

3962
03:10:55.24 --> 03:11:00.68
And I started researching this and suddenly I was like, I remember going to the garage

3963
03:11:00.68 --> 03:11:03.88
and calling my best friend and I was like, I feel like I've just read about a terminal

3964
03:11:03.88 --> 03:11:07.60
diagnosis like this shit is scary.

3965
03:11:07.60 --> 03:11:14.60
I started really digging into the effects of blasts and repeated head trauma.

3966
03:11:14.60 --> 03:11:18.56
And like his 15 years playing football and 13 years as a breacher.

3967
03:11:18.56 --> 03:11:22.68
And I was like, I don't know that this is purely psychological.

3968
03:11:22.68 --> 03:11:24.68
I don't know that medication is going to help this.

3969
03:11:24.68 --> 03:11:27.24
I know talk therapy is not helping it.

3970
03:11:27.24 --> 03:11:32.000
And if anything, I feel like it could get worse over time and time is of the essence.

3971
03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:37.04
So that's when I really did this heart pivot and I saw him through new eyes.

3972
03:11:37.04 --> 03:11:42.24
And I was suddenly overcome with compassion for him because even though he had become

3973
03:11:42.24 --> 03:11:51.04
a monster, I remembered, I chose to remember who I met and who he was before this deterioration.

3974
03:11:51.04 --> 03:11:55.28
And so I held on to the hope that I could get that person back, but I knew that it was

3975
03:11:55.28 --> 03:11:58.60
going to be really, really, really tough and it might not happen.

3976
03:11:58.60 --> 03:12:02.16
I started like I was most comfortable with Western medicine.

3977
03:12:02.16 --> 03:12:06.56
And even though he was being a really good soldier and like doing, taking all the medication

3978
03:12:06.56 --> 03:12:11.96
that he was prescribed, I was like, I'm not sure that medication is what's, you know,

3979
03:12:11.96 --> 03:12:15.44
fixable here.

3980
03:12:15.44 --> 03:12:19.52
His only diagnosis really was he had his TBI documented all throughout his medical record,

3981
03:12:19.52 --> 03:12:22.64
but it was primarily like PTSD, PTSD.

3982
03:12:22.64 --> 03:12:27.44
And in my mind, I'm like, gosh, I don't know about that because he loved to deploy and

3983
03:12:27.44 --> 03:12:34.24
he would probably still be deploying if, you know, shit didn't go so far south.

3984
03:12:34.24 --> 03:12:39.76
I don't think that this is wrapped up in anything he did overseas.

3985
03:12:39.76 --> 03:12:41.64
What did make more sense was the TBI piece.

3986
03:12:41.64 --> 03:12:46.28
And so I started getting into brain clinics and I got him into like five total and he

3987
03:12:46.28 --> 03:12:49.64
was willing, but you know, it was weeks away from home.

3988
03:12:49.64 --> 03:12:52.24
It was a lot of diagnostics.

3989
03:12:52.24 --> 03:12:56.28
There really wasn't a lot of hope or follow up on the other side.

3990
03:12:56.28 --> 03:13:01.08
And he was becoming more and more and more angry and frustrated.

3991
03:13:01.08 --> 03:13:04.44
And he was really hopeful that I could help.

3992
03:13:04.44 --> 03:13:12.12
And my hope was diminishing month after month of more failed things.

3993
03:13:12.12 --> 03:13:14.24
What do you do at a brain clinic?

3994
03:13:14.24 --> 03:13:15.24
Oh, gosh.

3995
03:13:15.24 --> 03:13:16.68
I mean, they're all different.

3996
03:13:16.68 --> 03:13:20.32
You take, you do a ton of batteries.

3997
03:13:20.32 --> 03:13:21.64
You do a lot of cognitive testing.

3998
03:13:21.64 --> 03:13:23.24
You know, they put you in machines.

3999
03:13:23.24 --> 03:13:24.24
They spin you upside down.

4000
03:13:24.24 --> 03:13:28.64
Like they do a bunch of stuff that are really, in my opinion, for people who could like barely

4001
03:13:28.64 --> 03:13:32.64
walk and talk, you know, or have, you know, autism and all these other things.

4002
03:13:32.64 --> 03:13:35.96
And so for me, I was there just, I felt like passing time.

4003
03:13:35.96 --> 03:13:38.12
I'm like, none of this stuff helps.

4004
03:13:38.12 --> 03:13:40.68
Like, what am I doing here?

4005
03:13:40.68 --> 03:13:44.92
And really, oh, and you do like a lot of balancing.

4006
03:13:44.92 --> 03:13:49.52
I mean, it's for people again, this is my opinion, but it's for people that I consider

4007
03:13:49.52 --> 03:13:54.32
really fucked up, right, that are not like could barely talk.

4008
03:13:54.32 --> 03:13:58.08
Do you at this point think you're fucked up?

4009
03:13:58.08 --> 03:13:59.40
I was just looking for answers.

4010
03:13:59.40 --> 03:14:02.64
I was like, just please, just somebody tell me like something.

4011
03:14:02.64 --> 03:14:03.64
Okay.

4012
03:14:03.64 --> 03:14:07.04
So you think there's questions of what the hell's wrong with 100%.

4013
03:14:07.04 --> 03:14:08.04
Yeah.

4014
03:14:08.04 --> 03:14:12.76
I mean, I left NICO with, you know, with, you know, some, you know, the FMRI is showing

4015
03:14:12.76 --> 03:14:17.000
like, oh, you have these dead and partially brain that, you know, aren't working.

4016
03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:18.48
But and those are just TBIs.

4017
03:14:18.48 --> 03:14:21.60
Those are like TBIs, mild TBIs, mild TBIs.

4018
03:14:21.60 --> 03:14:25.32
He looked at me one time, Choco, like he was trying to get out the door and he used to

4019
03:14:25.32 --> 03:14:29.52
be so like regimented and like, you know, everything had a place and everything was

4020
03:14:29.52 --> 03:14:38.24
organized and he was just kind of like this disorganized functioning, but chaotic guy now.

4021
03:14:38.24 --> 03:14:43.60
And so he's trying to get out of the door for a flight and he was profusely sweating

4022
03:14:43.60 --> 03:14:48.68
and his eyes were gigantic and he looked at me and he was just like sheer terror.

4023
03:14:48.68 --> 03:14:51.76
Like something is wrong with my brain.

4024
03:14:51.76 --> 03:14:53.08
I don't know what's wrong with me.

4025
03:14:53.08 --> 03:14:55.44
Something is not right with my brain.

4026
03:14:55.44 --> 03:15:02.72
And so all throughout his medical record, it's like cognition issues, memory issues,

4027
03:15:02.72 --> 03:15:04.64
balance issues.

4028
03:15:04.64 --> 03:15:09.84
And I'm thinking he's the most capable human I know there's something that's out of his

4029
03:15:09.84 --> 03:15:13.92
control and I don't know.

4030
03:15:13.92 --> 03:15:16.72
Like doctors aren't helping.

4031
03:15:16.72 --> 03:15:20.76
When you when they when they look at these TBIs, these black areas in your brain, what

4032
03:15:20.76 --> 03:15:21.76
do they do about it?

4033
03:15:21.76 --> 03:15:22.76
Do they do anything?

4034
03:15:22.76 --> 03:15:23.76
Are they?

4035
03:15:23.76 --> 03:15:24.76
No, what's the?

4036
03:15:24.76 --> 03:15:29.20
No, because I think it's again, I think it's personalized because I know some individuals

4037
03:15:29.20 --> 03:15:35.48
that had no scarring that were struggling bad and then I know individuals that had a lot

4038
03:15:35.48 --> 03:15:37.88
of scarring and they were fine.

4039
03:15:37.88 --> 03:15:40.76
Maybe they weren't fine or maybe they were saying they were fine and they weren't doing

4040
03:15:40.76 --> 03:15:41.76
well.

4041
03:15:41.76 --> 03:15:47.68
But you know, my my my recollection and the conversations I have, people's people are

4042
03:15:47.68 --> 03:15:49.000
all over the map.

4043
03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:56.96
So individuals with no scarring to, you know, 45 lesions on their brain are acting different.

4044
03:15:56.96 --> 03:16:01.12
And it didn't mean that the ones with higher scarring were acting worse than the ones that

4045
03:16:01.12 --> 03:16:04.12
were, you know, maybe had none.

4046
03:16:04.12 --> 03:16:08.12
So like, I'm not a I'm not a neuroscience or neuroscientist.

4047
03:16:08.12 --> 03:16:09.80
Like I can't tell you why.

4048
03:16:09.80 --> 03:16:13.32
But I think like everything else is just personalized.

4049
03:16:13.32 --> 03:16:15.76
So there's no protocol for like, Oh, memory loss.

4050
03:16:15.76 --> 03:16:19.40
Here's what you need to do or yes, no, there absolutely is.

4051
03:16:19.40 --> 03:16:21.88
There's there's like exercises and yes.

4052
03:16:21.88 --> 03:16:23.92
Yeah, there's there's things you can do.

4053
03:16:23.92 --> 03:16:25.56
There's supplements you can take.

4054
03:16:25.56 --> 03:16:27.16
You know, I do all of it.

4055
03:16:27.16 --> 03:16:33.28
Like I take every supplement that I can find that says this reduces inflammation or this

4056
03:16:33.28 --> 03:16:37.36
helps you, you know, think clearly or, you know, whatever it is like new tropics, like

4057
03:16:37.36 --> 03:16:40.88
I'll try anything now that says, Hey, this is going to make your brain younger.

4058
03:16:40.88 --> 03:16:42.92
That's going to make you, you know, think more clearly.

4059
03:16:42.92 --> 03:16:43.92
Yeah.

4060
03:16:43.92 --> 03:16:47.56
I mean, I think, I think there's still a lot of research around there about, you know,

4061
03:16:47.56 --> 03:16:49.60
what, what we can take.

4062
03:16:49.60 --> 03:16:55.12
But again, I go back to diet and exercise for all matters.

4063
03:16:55.12 --> 03:16:56.64
We needed a nuclear option.

4064
03:16:56.64 --> 03:16:57.64
It all matters.

4065
03:16:57.64 --> 03:16:58.64
Yeah, you're right.

4066
03:16:58.64 --> 03:16:59.64
But it all matters.

4067
03:16:59.64 --> 03:17:00.64
It's not one thing.

4068
03:17:00.64 --> 03:17:02.96
And so how many of these brain clinic things did you go through?

4069
03:17:02.96 --> 03:17:03.96
I would do five.

4070
03:17:03.96 --> 03:17:08.32
And, you know, and honestly, I went to some really good ones from like, like world renowned.

4071
03:17:08.32 --> 03:17:10.96
And I thought they do really good stuff.

4072
03:17:10.96 --> 03:17:15.96
But a lot of these places, as soon as you leave, like it's kind of like they forget you,

4073
03:17:15.96 --> 03:17:20.16
you know, so they collect your money, which are some of these are astronomical, you know,

4074
03:17:20.16 --> 03:17:26.48
K 30 K two weeks a month, whatever it is, and then you leave and they forget about you.

4075
03:17:26.48 --> 03:17:30.84
And that's that was the part that I, you know, I struggle with is that if individuals want

4076
03:17:30.84 --> 03:17:35.32
to get better or these places want to get people better than they need to, there needs

4077
03:17:35.32 --> 03:17:39.44
to be some type of continuum of care, like they just need to check in on an individual

4078
03:17:39.44 --> 03:17:41.24
30 days, 90 days or whatever it is.

4079
03:17:41.24 --> 03:17:45.08
And, you know, we'll get probably, you know, more into it and what we're doing now.

4080
03:17:45.08 --> 03:17:49.88
But like Amber was saying, I was getting frustrated because I maybe get a diagnosis, but not

4081
03:17:49.88 --> 03:17:56.000
a, not a like, here's exactly what you do as a protocol, go home and do this every day.

4082
03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.48
It was just they're all very similar.

4083
03:17:58.48 --> 03:18:00.04
Great for diagnostics.

4084
03:18:00.04 --> 03:18:01.16
Great for diagnostics.

4085
03:18:01.16 --> 03:18:03.20
But what do you do with those diagnostics?

4086
03:18:03.20 --> 03:18:08.32
Yeah, well, they don't make any money either by doing anything else than you showing up

4087
03:18:08.32 --> 03:18:13.28
paying your bill and then telling you to come back so you can pay another bill.

4088
03:18:13.28 --> 03:18:22.24
So what was when was and where was rock bottom and what did it look like?

4089
03:18:22.24 --> 03:18:27.40
Amber, what is, what was it like for you where you are just, it's, can't get any worse than

4090
03:18:27.40 --> 03:18:30.28
this right now?

4091
03:18:30.28 --> 03:18:36.48
Do you mind if I, there's three stories that come to mind and I don't think I've shared

4092
03:18:36.48 --> 03:18:39.60
them publicly.

4093
03:18:39.60 --> 03:18:45.28
The first one was our son called me and said, are you home?

4094
03:18:45.28 --> 03:18:46.28
And I said, no, why?

4095
03:18:46.28 --> 03:18:50.48
He goes, I need to borrow a shirt from dad.

4096
03:18:50.48 --> 03:18:53.68
But when I went to your room, your bedroom doors closed, your bathroom doors closed,

4097
03:18:53.68 --> 03:18:57.44
I'm standing at your closet, but the closet doors closed and I'm afraid if I open it,

4098
03:18:57.44 --> 03:18:59.84
I'm going to find dad hanging.

4099
03:18:59.84 --> 03:19:06.04
And it was like a traumatic conversation, but it was also the normal in our house.

4100
03:19:06.04 --> 03:19:13.36
And I just, you know, that was the first real like, oh, this isn't normal.

4101
03:19:13.36 --> 03:19:15.68
How old is your son at this point?

4102
03:19:15.68 --> 03:19:16.68
15.

4103
03:19:16.68 --> 03:19:20.72
And, and what is it that he's picking up on?

4104
03:19:20.72 --> 03:19:30.40
It just felt palpable that dad didn't have a purpose anymore.

4105
03:19:30.40 --> 03:19:37.56
And it, it, catastrophe felt imminent.

4106
03:19:37.56 --> 03:19:38.76
And I didn't know what that looked like.

4107
03:19:38.76 --> 03:19:43.84
I didn't know if that meant drinking and driving and wrapping his trucker on a pole.

4108
03:19:43.84 --> 03:19:49.44
I didn't know if that meant taking his life.

4109
03:19:49.44 --> 03:19:50.44
I don't know.

4110
03:19:50.44 --> 03:19:52.68
I just felt like it's coming.

4111
03:19:52.68 --> 03:20:02.16
And then one night he came home and I, you know, 11 o'clock, he's not home, 12 o'clock,

4112
03:20:02.16 --> 03:20:05.16
he's not home, one, two.

4113
03:20:05.16 --> 03:20:09.20
And I heard him come home and I was just, I was like, I need to put the dresser in front

4114
03:20:09.20 --> 03:20:10.56
of the door.

4115
03:20:10.56 --> 03:20:16.96
And I, and then I ran out the back door and I thought, this is not normal.

4116
03:20:16.96 --> 03:20:26.16
This is, he never, he's never, ever, ever been physically aggressive with me, not once.

4117
03:20:26.16 --> 03:20:30.96
But it was tending in the direction that I didn't feel safe because I knew he'd been

4118
03:20:30.96 --> 03:20:35.52
drinking and that particular night, neither one of our kids were home.

4119
03:20:35.52 --> 03:20:40.84
They were both having sleepovers and I just got unnerved and maybe I overreacted.

4120
03:20:40.84 --> 03:20:46.92
But, you know, when you're sitting in a parking lot at 2am, you're just like, this can't,

4121
03:20:46.92 --> 03:20:50.44
this is, is not sustainable.

4122
03:20:50.44 --> 03:20:54.96
And then the third thing that happened, which was like the true rock bottom, the culmination

4123
03:20:54.96 --> 03:21:02.88
of my son feeling these things, me feeling these things, was when our daughter was riding

4124
03:21:02.88 --> 03:21:09.60
with Marcus and he had gotten into some like road construction and sort of like got lost

4125
03:21:09.60 --> 03:21:13.72
or got off track and they were coming to pick me up from an event.

4126
03:21:13.72 --> 03:21:15.12
I was out with my friends.

4127
03:21:15.12 --> 03:21:17.92
And by the time they got to me, he was so frustrated.

4128
03:21:17.92 --> 03:21:23.28
And of course, I didn't know had he been drinking, I didn't, I just see my car coming down the

4129
03:21:23.28 --> 03:21:28.88
street and out comes our daughter and she comes like spilling towards me and she, and

4130
03:21:28.88 --> 03:21:33.80
he tears off down the street and she said, he's, he's crazy mom.

4131
03:21:33.80 --> 03:21:34.92
We can't get in the car with him.

4132
03:21:34.92 --> 03:21:36.84
He'll kill us.

4133
03:21:36.84 --> 03:21:43.48
And she looked at me and she said, how much longer do we have to do this?

4134
03:21:43.48 --> 03:21:47.72
And I said, not one more day.

4135
03:21:47.72 --> 03:21:54.64
And the next day I got on the phone with his best friend who died, Josh, with his family

4136
03:21:54.64 --> 03:21:57.56
who had a foundation.

4137
03:21:57.56 --> 03:22:01.32
And I said, we need help.

4138
03:22:01.32 --> 03:22:06.44
I think if he goes to California and he does this sort of like trifecta brain treatment

4139
03:22:06.44 --> 03:22:13.12
that I can at least have like a minute to figure out next steps.

4140
03:22:13.12 --> 03:22:16.40
I, it was my last hope.

4141
03:22:16.40 --> 03:22:17.96
And so they arranged for the funding.

4142
03:22:17.96 --> 03:22:23.000
I arranged for him to leave what was supposed to be six weeks turned into like three months.

4143
03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:26.04
And during that three months, I came to visit him twice.

4144
03:22:26.04 --> 03:22:30.56
And the first time I came to visit, things were pretty good for a week or so.

4145
03:22:30.56 --> 03:22:34.16
But like on the last day of the trip, everything fell apart.

4146
03:22:34.16 --> 03:22:37.60
And so I went home really defeated and frustrated.

4147
03:22:37.60 --> 03:22:42.72
And in my mind, I was like, I don't think I can do this anymore.

4148
03:22:42.72 --> 03:22:48.28
And we got him out of the house and there's been so much peace in my house since he's

4149
03:22:48.28 --> 03:22:49.40
been away.

4150
03:22:49.40 --> 03:22:55.36
I was doing, I went out and do TMS like the transcrane o-magnetic.

4151
03:22:55.36 --> 03:23:00.32
There was a, and not to knock that because that's incredibly beneficial, but it wasn't

4152
03:23:00.32 --> 03:23:01.88
what we needed at the time.

4153
03:23:01.88 --> 03:23:04.64
It wasn't enough.

4154
03:23:04.64 --> 03:23:06.96
Would I sign him up to do it again?

4155
03:23:06.96 --> 03:23:12.000
Like for an extra bonus to where he's at now, like totally.

4156
03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.12
But it wasn't what we needed at the time.

4157
03:23:14.12 --> 03:23:17.44
So I came home thinking, okay, this is it.

4158
03:23:17.44 --> 03:23:18.64
I got to start making plans.

4159
03:23:18.64 --> 03:23:19.64
And I did.

4160
03:23:19.64 --> 03:23:22.76
I started making plans, but I wasn't like totally ready to pull the trigger because I just,

4161
03:23:22.76 --> 03:23:24.56
I never wanted to leave him.

4162
03:23:24.56 --> 03:23:30.04
But I definitely felt like I was in a position where I had to choose him or our kids.

4163
03:23:30.04 --> 03:23:36.80
And so he extended his stay, got more time at the centers.

4164
03:23:36.80 --> 03:23:39.36
And I thought, oh my God, visit him one more time.

4165
03:23:39.36 --> 03:23:44.64
So around this time for all my birthday, I came out to visit him and we were in his truck

4166
03:23:44.64 --> 03:23:50.28
and I said something so benign and he started just like tearing down the five.

4167
03:23:50.28 --> 03:23:55.44
And I thought, if I survive this truck ride, I'm done.

4168
03:23:55.44 --> 03:23:57.80
And I didn't even tell him that I was leaving.

4169
03:23:57.80 --> 03:24:03.76
The next day I got up and I packed my bag and I left for the airport and I came home

4170
03:24:03.76 --> 03:24:11.52
and my mom was there with the kids and I called my dad and I basically told my parents that

4171
03:24:11.52 --> 03:24:12.52
I'm quitting.

4172
03:24:12.52 --> 03:24:16.64
It was the first time that I'd really quit anything.

4173
03:24:16.64 --> 03:24:22.60
And my dad was like, you know, this is not a disappointment to me.

4174
03:24:22.60 --> 03:24:28.28
You are the, you are the most important thing right now and you feel that this is the right

4175
03:24:28.28 --> 03:24:29.28
thing to do.

4176
03:24:29.28 --> 03:24:33.28
Then I support you and whatever you need.

4177
03:24:33.28 --> 03:24:40.08
And I said, I think he's going to be dead in two to five years and I hate that, but

4178
03:24:40.08 --> 03:24:44.92
I'm going to try to start forgiving myself now because I feel like the inevitable is

4179
03:24:44.92 --> 03:24:47.76
going to happen.

4180
03:24:47.76 --> 03:24:53.36
We are the only stabilizing force that he has in his life and when that's gone, I don't

4181
03:24:53.36 --> 03:24:55.64
know.

4182
03:24:55.64 --> 03:25:02.20
And so I was really working on forgiving myself and also like during the, the year or so leading

4183
03:25:02.20 --> 03:25:08.92
into where we were at that point, I had been on my own really in depth journey of like

4184
03:25:08.92 --> 03:25:17.40
healing and getting back into my faith and like tapping into a higher power to help sustain

4185
03:25:17.40 --> 03:25:18.40
me.

4186
03:25:18.40 --> 03:25:24.32
And so there was this massive storm all around me, but I had become the eye of the storm.

4187
03:25:24.32 --> 03:25:30.96
And so things had never been so out of control, but I had never been so in control.

4188
03:25:30.96 --> 03:25:37.76
And so I was thinking clearly, I was making like really strategic decisions, but at the

4189
03:25:37.76 --> 03:25:43.20
same time I was listening to my intuition, which was like, you need to know that you've

4190
03:25:43.20 --> 03:25:49.84
tried everything because one, this is going to stay with your kids.

4191
03:25:49.84 --> 03:25:52.84
And you know, if the worst does happen, they're going to be, they're going to have to deal

4192
03:25:52.84 --> 03:25:54.60
with it for the rest of their lives.

4193
03:25:54.60 --> 03:26:01.48
And two, am I going to be able to know and say that I've tried everything?

4194
03:26:01.48 --> 03:26:05.40
So he was running out of funding in October.

4195
03:26:05.40 --> 03:26:11.92
And at that point, our finances had become a mess and he called home and said, I'm running

4196
03:26:11.92 --> 03:26:14.36
out of funding, like, can I come home?

4197
03:26:14.36 --> 03:26:21.68
And I basically said, you can come home, but as soon as you get here, I want to, I want

4198
03:26:21.68 --> 03:26:24.36
to talk.

4199
03:26:24.36 --> 03:26:30.20
And so he came home and I sat him down and I basically took a completely different approach

4200
03:26:30.20 --> 03:26:34.76
because up until that point, I mean, I definitely developed compassion for him and I had tried

4201
03:26:34.76 --> 03:26:38.96
really hard for, you know, this like 18 months that he was going to all these brain clinics.

4202
03:26:38.96 --> 03:26:44.12
But before that it was like guilt, shame, condemnation, you know, all of the things

4203
03:26:44.12 --> 03:26:47.92
that I was feeling, I was basically projecting onto him and I was creating what I was trying

4204
03:26:47.92 --> 03:26:49.000
to avoid.

4205
03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:53.52
So the more I would guilt him and shame him, the more bad behavior would come from it.

4206
03:26:53.52 --> 03:26:58.20
So the more guilt and shame I would throw on, it was just this toxic cycle.

4207
03:26:58.20 --> 03:27:06.24
So like this, the sort of time where I was reconnecting with just a greater wisdom of

4208
03:27:06.24 --> 03:27:13.32
how to handle the situation, I was overcome with compassion for him and like seeing him

4209
03:27:13.32 --> 03:27:18.32
for his struggles and for them seeming to be out of his control where before I always

4210
03:27:18.32 --> 03:27:23.64
thought like you're, you know, you could figure it out.

4211
03:27:23.64 --> 03:27:28.80
And so I just approached him in a completely new way and I said, if you fight with me,

4212
03:27:28.80 --> 03:27:33.36
I will fight for you every day of the rest of your life, but you have to fight with me.

4213
03:27:33.36 --> 03:27:35.20
You know, I love you.

4214
03:27:35.20 --> 03:27:38.28
I will never leave your side.

4215
03:27:38.28 --> 03:27:40.48
We've got to do this together.

4216
03:27:40.48 --> 03:27:47.68
And he totally, it totally softened him and he was like, what do you want to do?

4217
03:27:47.68 --> 03:27:52.36
And I said, there's one treatment that you haven't tried.

4218
03:27:52.36 --> 03:28:00.08
One of our dear and trusted friends, a couple had had gone down this path.

4219
03:28:00.08 --> 03:28:05.64
So like one other team guy that we had known at the time who'd done this and his situation

4220
03:28:05.64 --> 03:28:10.60
was like, you know, more of a crisis situation where ours was like very deliberate and we

4221
03:28:10.60 --> 03:28:17.56
had been, we'd known about it and talked about it on and off for a year, but it seemed crazy.

4222
03:28:17.56 --> 03:28:23.48
So I re-approached him about it and I said, you know, to go to Mexico and to try this.

4223
03:28:23.48 --> 03:28:27.52
And he was like, I mean, I'll try it.

4224
03:28:27.52 --> 03:28:30.40
Like don't get hopes up.

4225
03:28:30.40 --> 03:28:31.40
I remember saying that to him.

4226
03:28:31.40 --> 03:28:36.52
Like there's no chance that something is going to work because we've tried all the stuff

4227
03:28:36.52 --> 03:28:41.000
that we're supposed to like guys that, you know, other team guys have gone to have gotten

4228
03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:46.12
better or not gotten better, but something that I thought was crazy that I read about

4229
03:28:46.12 --> 03:28:48.04
seemed like it was crazy.

4230
03:28:48.04 --> 03:28:54.32
I didn't think that trying something new was going to even slowly or slightly help.

4231
03:28:54.32 --> 03:28:59.28
But I, you know, I committed just because like I sometimes maybe like you, I feel like

4232
03:28:59.28 --> 03:29:02.20
a, you know, guinea pig.

4233
03:29:02.20 --> 03:29:05.76
I'll try anything if you tell me like it works or it makes me, you know, bigger, faster,

4234
03:29:05.76 --> 03:29:07.28
stronger, smarter.

4235
03:29:07.28 --> 03:29:12.72
So you know, I did some research and it started to make sense that, you know, initially when

4236
03:29:12.72 --> 03:29:16.44
we're talking about psychedelic medicines, you know, they were intended and are intended

4237
03:29:16.44 --> 03:29:20.72
for medical use, not for, you know, recreational parties, you know, anything could be abused

4238
03:29:20.72 --> 03:29:22.48
for recreational parties.

4239
03:29:22.48 --> 03:29:27.28
And so the more I read, the more research I read, I said, that's kind of makes sense.

4240
03:29:27.28 --> 03:29:31.000
I'll, you know, basically I'll give it a go.

4241
03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:34.72
When what was rock bottom for you?

4242
03:29:34.72 --> 03:29:40.48
Like when, when Amber's going through all this, like from the outside looking at you,

4243
03:29:40.48 --> 03:29:44.04
just a little, seeming like there's just no hope.

4244
03:29:44.04 --> 03:29:45.80
What was rock bottom for you?

4245
03:29:45.80 --> 03:29:54.64
No hope, like no hope, no passion, no drive, anger, frustration, sadness, you know, depression,

4246
03:29:54.64 --> 03:29:55.64
all of it.

4247
03:29:55.64 --> 03:30:00.40
Like it just was like, again, going back to what we talked about earlier, didn't want

4248
03:30:00.40 --> 03:30:02.32
to do the things I enjoyed doing.

4249
03:30:02.32 --> 03:30:04.000
Didn't want to hang out with anybody.

4250
03:30:04.000 --> 03:30:05.000
Didn't want to have a conversation.

4251
03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:08.68
Didn't want to make do small talk.

4252
03:30:08.68 --> 03:30:09.68
Just.

4253
03:30:09.68 --> 03:30:11.80
All the above, just done.

4254
03:30:11.80 --> 03:30:14.08
Yeah, just done.

4255
03:30:14.08 --> 03:30:21.28
And like everything else I've had, I have days of like, I don't want to call it joy,

4256
03:30:21.28 --> 03:30:27.88
but just, you know, up like some uplifting days, but the majority of days were down and

4257
03:30:27.88 --> 03:30:29.56
you know, including weeks on end.

4258
03:30:29.56 --> 03:30:30.84
Some days I didn't want to get out of bed.

4259
03:30:30.84 --> 03:30:35.52
Like I said, I just shut my phone off where now, you know, we joke about it.

4260
03:30:35.52 --> 03:30:39.24
As long as you're trending upwards, you're going to have like you said, like, you know,

4261
03:30:39.24 --> 03:30:40.24
yours is different.

4262
03:30:40.24 --> 03:30:42.84
You're, you know, you're getting upset over a situation.

4263
03:30:42.84 --> 03:30:45.32
You know, that's completely normal.

4264
03:30:45.32 --> 03:30:50.44
I'll still have some down days, but they'll only last like an hour or before they would

4265
03:30:50.44 --> 03:30:52.76
last for literally days.

4266
03:30:52.76 --> 03:30:56.80
And you know, I think that just takes time over, you know, what we've been working on

4267
03:30:56.80 --> 03:30:58.80
over the last couple of years.

4268
03:30:58.80 --> 03:31:02.96
But yeah, I was just, I was just checked out of everything.

4269
03:31:02.96 --> 03:31:07.72
Medically, you know, mentally, physically, emotionally.

4270
03:31:07.72 --> 03:31:10.16
There was no, there was nothing in sight.

4271
03:31:10.16 --> 03:31:17.72
It was just like flat, clear, you know, not clear, but flat and, and really nothing looked

4272
03:31:17.72 --> 03:31:21.88
forward to.

4273
03:31:21.88 --> 03:31:25.52
Just real quick, how the hell were you guys paying for like everything?

4274
03:31:25.52 --> 03:31:26.52
Like just life?

4275
03:31:26.52 --> 03:31:28.40
Like you weren't working for months on end.

4276
03:31:28.40 --> 03:31:29.40
How?

4277
03:31:29.40 --> 03:31:31.72
Well, it was a struggle.

4278
03:31:31.72 --> 03:31:34.20
It was a real struggle.

4279
03:31:34.20 --> 03:31:35.20
Remaxed out a lot of credit cards.

4280
03:31:35.20 --> 03:31:38.32
Marcus has, he's medically retired soon.

4281
03:31:38.32 --> 03:31:39.32
Yeah, we did.

4282
03:31:39.32 --> 03:31:40.32
Oh, okay.

4283
03:31:40.32 --> 03:31:41.32
Yeah.

4284
03:31:41.32 --> 03:31:42.32
So I, but I was like, got it, which was not.

4285
03:31:42.32 --> 03:31:43.32
Yeah, it's not.

4286
03:31:43.32 --> 03:31:44.82
I mean, but at least it's like groceries, right?

4287
03:31:44.82 --> 03:31:47.000
I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it was.

4288
03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:50.20
And we had money, no, we had, you know, we had saved money just from, you know, from

4289
03:31:50.20 --> 03:31:52.20
the teams and stuff over the years.

4290
03:31:52.20 --> 03:31:56.48
I'm trying to think, were you working at the time or no?

4291
03:31:56.48 --> 03:32:00.36
Well, Caden had also gotten our Senate was dealing with some chronic health issues.

4292
03:32:00.36 --> 03:32:04.08
And so I was actually pulled away from, from.

4293
03:32:04.08 --> 03:32:07.000
So we were paying out of pocket for a lot of these medical expenses because most of

4294
03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:10.000
the stuff, a lot of stuff wasn't covered under insurance and you're probably dealing with

4295
03:32:10.000 --> 03:32:12.68
it with some of the stuff you're doing.

4296
03:32:12.68 --> 03:32:18.40
But yeah, you know, luckily we had a lot of these foundations are, you know, are there

4297
03:32:18.40 --> 03:32:20.16
for like these reasons.

4298
03:32:20.16 --> 03:32:21.84
So, all right.

4299
03:32:21.84 --> 03:32:28.36
So we get the deal where we're like, well, this is our last shot, last shot at the one

4300
03:32:28.36 --> 03:32:32.16
treatment that you haven't tried yet, which is psychedelic.

4301
03:32:32.16 --> 03:32:34.92
What is it, drugs, psychedelic plants?

4302
03:32:34.92 --> 03:32:35.92
What do you call it?

4303
03:32:35.92 --> 03:32:40.000
We'll call it, we'll call it a psychedelic assisted therapy, psychedelic assisted therapy.

4304
03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:42.04
So the drugs are psychedelics.

4305
03:32:42.04 --> 03:32:48.64
You know, psych, psychedelic mind manifesting, psychedelic, that's the meaning of it.

4306
03:32:48.64 --> 03:32:52.12
Psychedelic drugs are the, you know, the class.

4307
03:32:52.12 --> 03:32:57.24
The way this is going this medical route, they, they're including therapy in it because

4308
03:32:57.24 --> 03:33:01.32
what they're showing with the research is that if they, they take the drug and then

4309
03:33:01.32 --> 03:33:07.32
they bring in the therapy with it, the results are like through the roof because the psychedelic

4310
03:33:07.32 --> 03:33:09.92
really opens your mind up for change.

4311
03:33:09.92 --> 03:33:14.76
Basically gives you new, like think of it as if it's snowing and you have like fresh

4312
03:33:14.76 --> 03:33:18.52
powder and tracks haven't been on the, on the powder yet.

4313
03:33:18.52 --> 03:33:19.52
That's what psychedelics do.

4314
03:33:19.52 --> 03:33:24.92
It basically gives you like this new blanket of snow to build your own new tracks and you

4315
03:33:24.92 --> 03:33:26.76
could, you can still build those bad.

4316
03:33:26.76 --> 03:33:28.68
So you can still build in bad habits.

4317
03:33:28.68 --> 03:33:33.48
But the idea is if you have that coach or that therapist or that support, you can build

4318
03:33:33.48 --> 03:33:36.36
new tracks, like good tracks, good habits.

4319
03:33:36.36 --> 03:33:39.48
And that's, that's the idea of psychedelic assisted therapy.

4320
03:33:39.48 --> 03:33:42.44
At the time we had no idea what we were signing up for.

4321
03:33:42.44 --> 03:33:45.88
I don't even know what we're talking about right now when, when I heard about this.

4322
03:33:45.88 --> 03:33:49.76
But there's a team guy who his wife was like, Hey, you need to do this.

4323
03:33:49.76 --> 03:33:50.76
Yeah.

4324
03:33:50.76 --> 03:33:51.76
Yeah.

4325
03:33:51.76 --> 03:33:53.76
And I mean, that is the essence of our community is I just take care of one another.

4326
03:33:53.76 --> 03:33:58.72
And so they'd been there for us in the past and we knew about their struggles.

4327
03:33:58.72 --> 03:34:04.04
They knew about our struggles, but, um, you know, thankfully she felt compelled to reach

4328
03:34:04.04 --> 03:34:08.52
out to me and then I talked to him and then he talked to Marcus and because we trusted

4329
03:34:08.52 --> 03:34:12.24
and respected them so much, I felt comfortable.

4330
03:34:12.24 --> 03:34:15.36
I didn't do an ounce of research.

4331
03:34:15.36 --> 03:34:16.36
I did nothing.

4332
03:34:16.36 --> 03:34:21.64
I, I just convinced him to go trusted them, got him on the plane.

4333
03:34:21.64 --> 03:34:25.92
And I literally looked at the steering wheel of my car like this is it.

4334
03:34:25.92 --> 03:34:27.08
I did, I did the research.

4335
03:34:27.08 --> 03:34:32.04
And like I said, from what, from initially what I thought was, you know, I'll, I'll use

4336
03:34:32.04 --> 03:34:39.40
the term crazy to, it started to make sense that again, these were intended for medical

4337
03:34:39.40 --> 03:34:45.12
use and, you know, it was stigmatized because we all know it as just crazy, crazy drugs

4338
03:34:45.12 --> 03:34:49.72
that people around the sixties and seventies, you know, ran around concerts doing, losing

4339
03:34:49.72 --> 03:34:50.72
their minds.

4340
03:34:50.72 --> 03:34:56.08
And they're intended for, for, for mental health and behavioral health use and now substance

4341
03:34:56.08 --> 03:34:58.20
abuse and, you know, host of other things.

4342
03:34:58.20 --> 03:35:00.92
So, so the more I read, the more it made sense.

4343
03:35:00.92 --> 03:35:04.96
Um, and I figured, okay, I'm going to give this a shot.

4344
03:35:04.96 --> 03:35:06.60
So you get on a plane.

4345
03:35:06.60 --> 03:35:09.04
You just said you go, well, you drop them off at the airport.

4346
03:35:09.04 --> 03:35:10.04
Yeah.

4347
03:35:10.04 --> 03:35:11.04
And I'm like, this is it.

4348
03:35:11.04 --> 03:35:13.80
This is like putting everything on the table.

4349
03:35:13.80 --> 03:35:16.52
And if it doesn't work, I'm going to have to come back to the drawing board.

4350
03:35:16.52 --> 03:35:21.04
If it does work, the best I can hope for is that it buys me some time to find something

4351
03:35:21.04 --> 03:35:23.36
that's a little bit more comfortable.

4352
03:35:23.36 --> 03:35:27.92
I didn't think it was like a magic bullet, but I definitely thought that if anything,

4353
03:35:27.92 --> 03:35:29.48
it was buying me some time.

4354
03:35:29.48 --> 03:35:33.20
Um, and then I went to see him the next day.

4355
03:35:33.20 --> 03:35:38.28
So I'm talking about that whenever, but, well, yeah, let's get, so you get on a plane and

4356
03:35:38.28 --> 03:35:40.20
where do you fly through Marcus?

4357
03:35:40.20 --> 03:35:42.52
Coming to San Diego and then sweet.

4358
03:35:42.52 --> 03:35:43.52
Yeah.

4359
03:35:43.52 --> 03:35:48.80
And then, uh, caravan down to a clinic in Mexico.

4360
03:35:48.80 --> 03:35:50.60
I've been operating for a long time.

4361
03:35:50.60 --> 03:35:52.12
The good reputation.

4362
03:35:52.12 --> 03:35:57.76
Um, we'll keep those separated for now because, uh, one, just kind of, you know, security

4363
03:35:57.76 --> 03:36:01.52
reasons guys going down, we like to try to keep the two separated.

4364
03:36:01.52 --> 03:36:03.60
Wait, what are we keeping separated?

4365
03:36:03.60 --> 03:36:07.72
Just us, what we're doing with the nonprofit and then the, you know, the retreats that

4366
03:36:07.72 --> 03:36:11.76
a lot of the people are going to for these, uh, to do these medicines.

4367
03:36:11.76 --> 03:36:13.48
So we just don't like to connect.

4368
03:36:13.48 --> 03:36:14.84
It's the two.

4369
03:36:14.84 --> 03:36:15.84
I don't understand.

4370
03:36:15.84 --> 03:36:16.84
That's okay.

4371
03:36:16.84 --> 03:36:17.84
That's good.

4372
03:36:17.84 --> 03:36:19.36
We'll just, we'll talk about it as we go.

4373
03:36:19.36 --> 03:36:24.72
So, uh, when you say keep these things separated, just mean like different clinics or something

4374
03:36:24.72 --> 03:36:27.76
like disclosing the retreat location or name or anything.

4375
03:36:27.76 --> 03:36:28.76
Okay.

4376
03:36:28.76 --> 03:36:29.76
Okay.

4377
03:36:29.76 --> 03:36:30.76
Got it.

4378
03:36:30.76 --> 03:36:31.76
Yeah.

4379
03:36:31.76 --> 03:36:32.76
For sure.

4380
03:36:32.76 --> 03:36:33.76
No problem.

4381
03:36:33.76 --> 03:36:34.76
Got that.

4382
03:36:34.76 --> 03:36:35.76
Okay.

4383
03:36:35.76 --> 03:36:36.76
Check.

4384
03:36:36.76 --> 03:36:37.76
Check in Roger.

4385
03:36:37.76 --> 03:36:38.76
Sorry.

4386
03:36:38.76 --> 03:36:39.76
My communication skills were terrible there.

4387
03:36:39.76 --> 03:36:40.76
So I apologize.

4388
03:36:40.76 --> 03:36:41.76
No, it's all good.

4389
03:36:41.76 --> 03:36:42.76
So you go to this clinic.

4390
03:36:42.76 --> 03:36:43.76
You're going to do it too?

4391
03:36:43.76 --> 03:36:48.000
No, the one who is escorting you, you just bro it out.

4392
03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:49.64
He's growing out and make sure I'm good.

4393
03:36:49.64 --> 03:36:51.64
Uh, I don't know what to expect.

4394
03:36:51.64 --> 03:36:52.64
What is the place like?

4395
03:36:52.64 --> 03:36:54.36
Is this like, no, awesome.

4396
03:36:54.36 --> 03:36:59.60
Is it like a beautiful, like beautiful home, overlooking the water, everything, perfect

4397
03:36:59.60 --> 03:37:04.64
food, uh, staff, seem like a hospital or does it seem like a does not seem like a does

4398
03:37:04.64 --> 03:37:07.20
not seem like a, but it is set up with hospital equipment.

4399
03:37:07.20 --> 03:37:08.20
Yeah.

4400
03:37:08.20 --> 03:37:12.72
And it's set up with like full medical, you know, you're on a EKG or a heart rate monitor.

4401
03:37:12.72 --> 03:37:16.56
You're doing your analysis to make sure there's nothing in your system.

4402
03:37:16.56 --> 03:37:19.28
You're doing blood work to make sure you're not lying.

4403
03:37:19.28 --> 03:37:25.44
Um, there's like, there's a whole protocol and the more stringent you are on the screening,

4404
03:37:25.44 --> 03:37:26.84
the better the outcome.

4405
03:37:26.84 --> 03:37:33.56
Uh, individuals that have trouble with psychedelic medicine again is the screening.

4406
03:37:33.56 --> 03:37:37.04
So if the screen is not done correctly, there can be issues.

4407
03:37:37.04 --> 03:37:40.20
You screen properly is almost little to no issues.

4408
03:37:40.20 --> 03:37:45.80
And so the more that this whole industry moves forward, um, it's just got to be done correctly.

4409
03:37:45.80 --> 03:37:50.04
And so this place again, has been running for a long time, had been doing it the right

4410
03:37:50.04 --> 03:37:57.04
way, not an underground shaman that is getting drugs from God knows where and saying here,

4411
03:37:57.04 --> 03:37:58.52
do this, it's good for you.

4412
03:37:58.52 --> 03:38:00.08
Getting drugs from Fred.

4413
03:38:00.08 --> 03:38:01.08
Yeah.

4414
03:38:01.08 --> 03:38:02.08
Right.

4415
03:38:02.08 --> 03:38:03.08
And who's making it in his bathtub.

4416
03:38:03.08 --> 03:38:04.08
Exactly.

4417
03:38:04.08 --> 03:38:06.44
Uh, who was a chemist in high school.

4418
03:38:06.44 --> 03:38:09.76
How long are you there for like, okay, so, so you show up?

4419
03:38:09.76 --> 03:38:13.20
Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a three to five day event.

4420
03:38:13.20 --> 03:38:17.36
Summer, summer shorter, summer longer.

4421
03:38:17.36 --> 03:38:22.000
Um, you do this, you know, you do a full, like I was saying, a full intake, a full medical

4422
03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:23.000
screening.

4423
03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:27.92
Uh, you talk to a psychedelic coach who's a therapist first.

4424
03:38:27.92 --> 03:38:32.92
So like a psychologist or like a licensed therapist who's trained in psychedelic medicine,

4425
03:38:32.92 --> 03:38:34.96
they prepare you for the experience.

4426
03:38:34.96 --> 03:38:39.88
And again, uh, the better outcomes are the ones who prepare the most.

4427
03:38:39.88 --> 03:38:45.84
So if you can, uh, what, what that individual does at licensed professional is going to

4428
03:38:45.84 --> 03:38:49.48
talk to you about what your experience may be like or what you're going through and what

4429
03:38:49.48 --> 03:38:50.96
you may experience.

4430
03:38:50.96 --> 03:38:56.08
And the idea is to prepare your, they call it set and setting your mindset, get your

4431
03:38:56.08 --> 03:38:58.96
mindset in the right place to go into these treatments.

4432
03:38:58.96 --> 03:39:06.60
So sometimes you hear about these bad trips, sometimes bad trips are just that an individual's

4433
03:39:06.60 --> 03:39:08.16
mindset was not in a good place.

4434
03:39:08.16 --> 03:39:09.16
They were at a Slayer concert.

4435
03:39:09.16 --> 03:39:13.32
They were at a Slayer concert or yes, for sure.

4436
03:39:13.32 --> 03:39:18.24
Or they watched like a nasty movie that they started thinking about during their experience

4437
03:39:18.24 --> 03:39:20.44
that just turned it sideways.

4438
03:39:20.44 --> 03:39:23.64
But here's the other thing about bad experiences, what we're learning.

4439
03:39:23.64 --> 03:39:28.08
Some of those bad experiences actually many or most of them, especially with team guys

4440
03:39:28.08 --> 03:39:32.16
and other veterans, they're, they're good experiences.

4441
03:39:32.16 --> 03:39:36.76
Those bad experiences, they have to go through to get out the other side.

4442
03:39:36.76 --> 03:39:41.32
So the bad experiences are some of the shit that they may experience as a kid.

4443
03:39:41.32 --> 03:39:45.76
Maybe there's some sexual assaults that went on as a child.

4444
03:39:45.76 --> 03:39:49.56
Maybe, uh, you know, maybe they did watch their friend get popped in the head and die

4445
03:39:49.56 --> 03:39:54.60
right in front of them and they experienced that on their, you know, on their journey.

4446
03:39:54.60 --> 03:39:55.60
So all types of that.

4447
03:39:55.60 --> 03:40:01.08
So those are bad trips, but those bad trips are actually like showing, showing them working

4448
03:40:01.08 --> 03:40:02.08
through stuff.

4449
03:40:02.08 --> 03:40:06.76
But, you know, people may take years doing it through quote unquote talk therapy or

4450
03:40:06.76 --> 03:40:08.08
psychotherapy.

4451
03:40:08.08 --> 03:40:11.000
You can do that in a few days done properly.

4452
03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:17.40
Again, not at a Slayer concert with Joe the shaman.

4453
03:40:17.40 --> 03:40:23.76
So what's the, so you screen your screen, you do, um, you do some integration, uh, excuse

4454
03:40:23.76 --> 03:40:24.76
me, some preparation.

4455
03:40:24.76 --> 03:40:27.52
Again, this is from the therapist coach.

4456
03:40:27.52 --> 03:40:35.60
Um, once that's done, um, you're, you're given the medicine and just like you would

4457
03:40:35.60 --> 03:40:42.52
take ibuprofen or Tylenol or Xedrin or probably a few others that I don't know for headache,

4458
03:40:42.52 --> 03:40:43.88
psychedelic drugs are the same way.

4459
03:40:43.88 --> 03:40:50.16
So there's, you know, Ibogaine and there's a psilocybin and there's MDMA and there's,

4460
03:40:50.16 --> 03:40:53.000
um, what am I missing?

4461
03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:59.60
I was good at you hearing about, um, so there's all these psychedelic drugs that slightly

4462
03:40:59.60 --> 03:41:04.40
do they're similar, but they do something slightly different, but they're all relatively

4463
03:41:04.40 --> 03:41:06.40
trying to solve the same problem.

4464
03:41:06.40 --> 03:41:10.88
And so, um, the, the drug that I experienced was called Ibogaine.

4465
03:41:10.88 --> 03:41:16.28
And, um, again, to me, you could have told me I was eating fruit loops.

4466
03:41:16.28 --> 03:41:19.16
Um, I'm like, okay, fruit loops.

4467
03:41:19.16 --> 03:41:21.08
That's that I had no idea.

4468
03:41:21.08 --> 03:41:22.16
Is it a pill?

4469
03:41:22.16 --> 03:41:23.24
It's a, yeah, it's a pill.

4470
03:41:23.24 --> 03:41:24.44
It's just like powdered pill.

4471
03:41:24.44 --> 03:41:26.28
It's in, it's in pill form.

4472
03:41:26.28 --> 03:41:29.24
You take it, uh, dependent upon your body weight.

4473
03:41:29.24 --> 03:41:32.16
Um, and, but again, it's personalized.

4474
03:41:32.16 --> 03:41:34.92
So I metabolize shit faster than you might.

4475
03:41:34.92 --> 03:41:40.52
So what works for me, if I take, I don't know, I'm making this number 800 milligrams, you

4476
03:41:40.52 --> 03:41:42.44
may need, you know, 1.2 grams.

4477
03:41:42.44 --> 03:41:46.04
And just because I maybe metabolize it faster or slower.

4478
03:41:46.04 --> 03:41:51.56
So it's, it's science, but there's also a little bit of subjectivity to the amount that

4479
03:41:51.56 --> 03:41:52.56
individuals need.

4480
03:41:52.56 --> 03:41:55.40
I'm having a flashback of when you were talking about when you were drinking for the first

4481
03:41:55.40 --> 03:41:58.76
time, you're like, I don't understand how this is going to make me like think any different.

4482
03:41:58.76 --> 03:42:00.92
Oh, this is exactly the thing.

4483
03:42:00.92 --> 03:42:05.12
This is probably even worse because I mean, we're talking about a, we're talking about

4484
03:42:05.12 --> 03:42:06.36
going on a journey here.

4485
03:42:06.36 --> 03:42:07.88
The world's most powerful psychedelics.

4486
03:42:07.88 --> 03:42:12.28
And so that's what I was getting at is Ibogaine is considered, uh, one of the world's most

4487
03:42:12.28 --> 03:42:13.28
powerful psychedelics.

4488
03:42:13.28 --> 03:42:15.64
That's why we call it the nuclear option.

4489
03:42:15.64 --> 03:42:16.84
Not everybody needs to do this.

4490
03:42:16.84 --> 03:42:20.88
No, no way near or not even close to everybody needs to do this.

4491
03:42:20.88 --> 03:42:26.12
But what we're seeing is, um, some of the stuff that I was experiencing, you know, as

4492
03:42:26.12 --> 03:42:29.84
I was transitioning out of the teams and like the years of like, you know, if you want to

4493
03:42:29.84 --> 03:42:34.80
call it co-morbidity of other things, like, oh, he's a little depressed and maybe he's

4494
03:42:34.80 --> 03:42:39.000
got some TBI's and maybe he's going on, you know, going through some shit with transition

4495
03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:42.04
and you know, Ibogaine's good.

4496
03:42:42.04 --> 03:42:46.08
But for an individual that maybe just going through a little bit of depression, maybe

4497
03:42:46.08 --> 03:42:51.44
can't get themselves out of, you know, out of a hole, maybe Ibogaine is not the right

4498
03:42:51.44 --> 03:42:54.96
thing for it because it is, it is a really rough journey.

4499
03:42:54.96 --> 03:42:57.24
And I'm sure like you said, you've talked to some friends.

4500
03:42:57.24 --> 03:42:58.68
Um, it's not fun.

4501
03:42:58.68 --> 03:43:00.64
Like it's not, it's not joy at all.

4502
03:43:00.64 --> 03:43:04.84
And anybody who takes that for recreational use, like I want to talk to them.

4503
03:43:04.84 --> 03:43:08.76
And actually they need to go talk to a psych because there's something definitely wrong

4504
03:43:08.76 --> 03:43:10.60
with that individual.

4505
03:43:10.60 --> 03:43:12.12
So you take it.

4506
03:43:12.12 --> 03:43:13.12
Yeah.

4507
03:43:13.12 --> 03:43:14.12
You take, so you take this medicine.

4508
03:43:14.12 --> 03:43:15.12
I'm going to call it a medicine.

4509
03:43:15.12 --> 03:43:18.60
You know, I don't think technically we can call it yet, but we're calling it medicines

4510
03:43:18.60 --> 03:43:20.84
because they are medicines.

4511
03:43:20.84 --> 03:43:25.20
And then, you know, you lie down in bed, you put, um, like noise canceling headphones

4512
03:43:25.20 --> 03:43:33.08
on, uh, you put eye shades on and, you know, within an hour, you start kind of going into

4513
03:43:33.08 --> 03:43:37.24
this experience and for everybody, it's different.

4514
03:43:37.24 --> 03:43:48.84
Um, but you basically go on a, you know, six to eight to 12 or even longer hour, uh, journey

4515
03:43:48.84 --> 03:43:53.16
and for everybody else again, because it's your mind or my mind, uh, and our minds are

4516
03:43:53.16 --> 03:43:54.16
different.

4517
03:43:54.16 --> 03:43:57.20
What I'm going to experience is going to be different from what you experienced or from

4518
03:43:57.20 --> 03:44:01.72
what, you know, you experience and it's working on a few different things.

4519
03:44:01.72 --> 03:44:08.20
The one is the story and that's like the psychological piece, the trauma piece where, um, if there

4520
03:44:08.20 --> 03:44:13.84
are real things that really fucked you up in the past, whatever it is.

4521
03:44:13.84 --> 03:44:19.56
So a lot of the addiction, right, is coming, finding out from things that happen in individuals

4522
03:44:19.56 --> 03:44:24.84
lives, not just because they like to drink or they like to do heroin or whatever.

4523
03:44:24.84 --> 03:44:29.96
They're doing it because something fucked them up so bad that they turn to that, whatever

4524
03:44:29.96 --> 03:44:30.96
it is.

4525
03:44:30.96 --> 03:44:36.44
They don't need to discuss what, whatever that is, um, the psychedelic does a really

4526
03:44:36.44 --> 03:44:42.60
good job and they say it's a jokester too, because it will show you that and it'll fuck

4527
03:44:42.60 --> 03:44:43.60
with you too.

4528
03:44:43.60 --> 03:44:54.52
Um, but the thing is what you just said, sometimes the only way, um, the only way, the only way

4529
03:44:54.52 --> 03:45:01.40
to heal is through and the only way to conquer something is through.

4530
03:45:01.40 --> 03:45:05.96
Like you have to face it and we know that and you can't, you can't bury stuff or if

4531
03:45:05.96 --> 03:45:10.80
you have an issue with a, with a team guy that you work with, if you just keep burying

4532
03:45:10.80 --> 03:45:14.44
or put stuff on, off on the side, it's going to blow up one day.

4533
03:45:14.44 --> 03:45:17.60
But if you can take that person and say, Hey, let's, let's settle our differences.

4534
03:45:17.60 --> 03:45:18.60
What's going on here?

4535
03:45:18.60 --> 03:45:19.60
Like you don't like me.

4536
03:45:19.60 --> 03:45:20.60
I don't like you.

4537
03:45:20.60 --> 03:45:21.60
Why?

4538
03:45:21.60 --> 03:45:22.60
We have to work together.

4539
03:45:22.60 --> 03:45:26.04
If you don't have that conversation, it's, it's going to be messed up forever.

4540
03:45:26.04 --> 03:45:28.96
So that, that's what the psychedelic does to the mind.

4541
03:45:28.96 --> 03:45:34.72
It shows you the problem that you're dealing with and you face it in this 12 hour journey

4542
03:45:34.72 --> 03:45:35.72
and it could suck.

4543
03:45:35.72 --> 03:45:37.96
And for me, it, it was really tough.

4544
03:45:37.96 --> 03:45:45.40
I mean, it was, it was 12 hours of like gore and blood and just crap.

4545
03:45:45.40 --> 03:45:51.20
But when I was done, it literally felt like I just took a thousand pounds out of a backpack.

4546
03:45:51.20 --> 03:45:57.64
It was just like, it was just like this relief that I never had before and all this like

4547
03:45:57.64 --> 03:46:03.40
pent up frustration that Amber's talking about that just like went away.

4548
03:46:03.40 --> 03:46:05.76
And for everybody else, it's different.

4549
03:46:05.76 --> 03:46:11.000
And so what talk therapy or psychotherapy can take five or 10 or 15 years.

4550
03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:15.32
I mean, I still have friends up in LA that are still seeing a psychologist for 20 years.

4551
03:46:15.32 --> 03:46:19.48
And I'm like, dude, I can help you out probably in a week.

4552
03:46:19.48 --> 03:46:20.96
Like you've been paying this person.

4553
03:46:20.96 --> 03:46:24.000
It's obviously not helping.

4554
03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:29.12
You know, it can, it can do that in a much faster timeframe.

4555
03:46:29.12 --> 03:46:30.80
And like Amber said, it's not a panacea.

4556
03:46:30.80 --> 03:46:33.72
It's not a magic bullet.

4557
03:46:33.72 --> 03:46:35.76
Sometimes you need to go down twice.

4558
03:46:35.76 --> 03:46:37.56
Sometimes maybe to do it three times.

4559
03:46:37.56 --> 03:46:40.12
Maybe you need to do it once a year.

4560
03:46:40.12 --> 03:46:41.62
Everybody's different.

4561
03:46:41.62 --> 03:46:47.24
But again, I don't want people who are listening to get the wrong idea that, that this is a

4562
03:46:47.24 --> 03:46:52.000
one and done or it's like a magic pill because, you know, everybody would be rushing to do

4563
03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:56.44
it and think like, again, you know, all my answers, you know, be solved and just this,

4564
03:46:56.44 --> 03:46:59.76
you know, this bottle right here, it takes a lot of work.

4565
03:46:59.76 --> 03:47:02.28
The experience itself is going to suck.

4566
03:47:02.28 --> 03:47:03.28
It's going to be miserable.

4567
03:47:03.28 --> 03:47:04.28
You're going to cry.

4568
03:47:04.28 --> 03:47:05.28
You're going to throw up.

4569
03:47:05.28 --> 03:47:08.36
Like you're going to like nobody wants to face their rapist.

4570
03:47:08.36 --> 03:47:09.36
You know what I mean?

4571
03:47:09.36 --> 03:47:15.04
So if they were, they were raped as a young child and that's what's affecting you for

4572
03:47:15.04 --> 03:47:18.96
the right, like you're going to face that individual during, and that's, that's pretty

4573
03:47:18.96 --> 03:47:20.68
traumatic for an individual.

4574
03:47:20.68 --> 03:47:21.68
Right.

4575
03:47:21.68 --> 03:47:26.56
If they're growing up and their uncle was molesting them for years upon years, you know, upon

4576
03:47:26.56 --> 03:47:29.92
years, if that's still affecting them in their life, they're going to face that in their

4577
03:47:29.92 --> 03:47:30.92
journey and that's tough.

4578
03:47:30.92 --> 03:47:31.92
But you know what?

4579
03:47:31.92 --> 03:47:33.72
You need to face that to move on.

4580
03:47:33.72 --> 03:47:35.56
And that's what these medicines do.

4581
03:47:35.56 --> 03:47:36.68
They also work on the brain.

4582
03:47:36.68 --> 03:47:40.68
So they promote neurogenesis, which meaning it's like, you know, brain growth and they,

4583
03:47:40.68 --> 03:47:43.36
they're turning on parts of the brain that may have not been working before.

4584
03:47:43.36 --> 03:47:47.72
And I think that's what we're seeing in the success for a lot of these guys is if they

4585
03:47:47.72 --> 03:47:52.36
do have mild TBIs and they're, they have these scarring that we're talking about and maybe

4586
03:47:52.36 --> 03:47:56.92
parts of their brain, we're not allowing them the function well, it is allowing them the

4587
03:47:56.92 --> 03:47:57.92
function well now.

4588
03:47:57.92 --> 03:48:01.52
So there's a host of things and I don't want to get into science because I'm way above

4589
03:48:01.52 --> 03:48:06.96
my pay grade in Chaco, but you know, this experience was, was radical.

4590
03:48:06.96 --> 03:48:09.64
It was, you know, did a 180 for me.

4591
03:48:09.64 --> 03:48:11.96
It was life changing and life saving.

4592
03:48:11.96 --> 03:48:18.32
Amber actually came in the day after and I walked down the hallway and I, we just, first

4593
03:48:18.32 --> 03:48:25.72
of all, I freaked out because it hit me when I was in the car headed there.

4594
03:48:25.72 --> 03:48:31.56
I was very uncomfortable and I was raised, you know, super conservative and I feel like,

4595
03:48:31.56 --> 03:48:39.64
you know, I was in the survival mode and suddenly like this piece had come and in the car on

4596
03:48:39.64 --> 03:48:42.76
the way there, I had this moment where I was like, I can't go.

4597
03:48:42.76 --> 03:48:44.000
I don't know what we've just done.

4598
03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:47.48
I think what we've done is bad.

4599
03:48:47.48 --> 03:48:50.44
And I'm too scared to face it.

4600
03:48:50.44 --> 03:48:54.16
And my girlfriend was like, you have to go.

4601
03:48:54.16 --> 03:48:55.24
He's asking for you.

4602
03:48:55.24 --> 03:48:56.24
And we told him you're coming.

4603
03:48:56.24 --> 03:48:57.36
So you have to go.

4604
03:48:57.36 --> 03:49:04.80
And I walked in there so uptight and scared of, oh, it was the most nerve wracking feeling

4605
03:49:04.80 --> 03:49:11.52
and I heard him walking down the hall and I was just like, oh my gosh, please, please

4606
03:49:11.52 --> 03:49:13.88
let this have worked.

4607
03:49:13.88 --> 03:49:19.72
And he came around the hall and immediately I could just see that he was back.

4608
03:49:19.72 --> 03:49:30.04
It was like, it was literally like being reunited with the person that I met, which is a complete

4609
03:49:30.04 --> 03:49:34.12
and utter, excuse me, language mindfuck.

4610
03:49:34.12 --> 03:49:41.92
It really threw me in the best ways and also in the worst ways because then you start to

4611
03:49:41.92 --> 03:49:45.72
doubt it and second guess, like it's too good to be true and like you're sliding your walls

4612
03:49:45.72 --> 03:49:50.40
down and you're like, oh, don't do that because this isn't going to last.

4613
03:49:50.40 --> 03:49:56.20
So a lot of spouses have experienced that and that mild freak out was certainly replaced

4614
03:49:56.20 --> 03:49:58.84
with this feeling of complete relief.

4615
03:49:58.84 --> 03:50:02.08
And then how do we maintain this?

4616
03:50:02.08 --> 03:50:06.88
Yeah, so the first thing I did, I said, Amra, this is exactly, I mean, the first thing out

4617
03:50:06.88 --> 03:50:08.96
of my mouth was like, this is exactly what the guys need.

4618
03:50:08.96 --> 03:50:14.64
I say, we keep getting phone calls of friends that are struggling like I was.

4619
03:50:14.64 --> 03:50:17.88
I'm like, dude, I can't take care of you because I can't even fucking take care of myself right

4620
03:50:17.88 --> 03:50:19.84
now.

4621
03:50:19.84 --> 03:50:22.12
So when I experienced this, like that's the first thing I said.

4622
03:50:22.12 --> 03:50:26.68
I was like, we got to figure out a way to get our friends here and do the same thing.

4623
03:50:26.68 --> 03:50:31.24
We have to figure out how to raise money because someone paid for me $4,000 or whatever it

4624
03:50:31.24 --> 03:50:32.24
was.

4625
03:50:32.24 --> 03:50:37.56
And so I said, well, how do we get our buddies and families that are struggling to do the

4626
03:50:37.56 --> 03:50:38.56
same thing?

4627
03:50:38.56 --> 03:50:39.56
He said, I don't know.

4628
03:50:39.56 --> 03:50:42.08
We said, well, we got to go raise money.

4629
03:50:42.08 --> 03:50:43.08
We'll start a nonprofit.

4630
03:50:43.08 --> 03:50:46.68
Again, had no idea what we were talking about.

4631
03:50:46.68 --> 03:50:48.16
We'll start a nonprofit.

4632
03:50:48.16 --> 03:50:52.16
We'll go raise money and then we'll fund our friends so they could get the same healing

4633
03:50:52.16 --> 03:50:54.12
that I feel like I'm experiencing right now.

4634
03:50:54.12 --> 03:50:55.60
We thought maybe a handful.

4635
03:50:55.60 --> 03:50:57.60
Yeah, we didn't know.

4636
03:50:57.60 --> 03:50:58.60
We didn't know.

4637
03:50:58.60 --> 03:50:59.60
Honestly, we didn't know.

4638
03:50:59.60 --> 03:51:02.40
And that's what we did.

4639
03:51:02.40 --> 03:51:10.52
Well then we were contacted by Elizabeth and she said, I want to give to a veteran organization.

4640
03:51:10.52 --> 03:51:13.80
He actually had his treatment on Veterans Day.

4641
03:51:13.80 --> 03:51:14.80
So it was really special.

4642
03:51:14.80 --> 03:51:20.80
And then end of year giving, right after that in December, made this lady contact Marcus

4643
03:51:20.80 --> 03:51:24.000
and say, I need a recommendation for a veterans organization to give to.

4644
03:51:24.000 --> 03:51:33.32
And he goes, we can't give you a tax write off, but if you pay this clinic, I could get

4645
03:51:33.32 --> 03:51:37.60
five of my friends down there for a treatment that could save their life.

4646
03:51:37.60 --> 03:51:39.40
And she was totally on board.

4647
03:51:39.40 --> 03:51:44.24
And that's what really launched what has become vets.

4648
03:51:44.24 --> 03:51:46.68
But we don't want to talk about it.

4649
03:51:46.68 --> 03:51:51.000
We don't want to talk about it because it's so stigmatized and so taboo to say you're

4650
03:51:51.000 --> 03:51:52.000
struggling.

4651
03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:56.44
Maybe some of our internal friends knew primarily because the wives were talking, not because

4652
03:51:56.44 --> 03:51:58.000
the guys were talking.

4653
03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:01.64
And so my thing was, I don't want to jinx it.

4654
03:52:01.64 --> 03:52:04.28
I don't want to, I don't know if it'll work for everyone.

4655
03:52:04.28 --> 03:52:06.64
I don't know if it'll continue working for us.

4656
03:52:06.64 --> 03:52:12.60
I don't want to talk about it until 12 months have gone by and we've raised money and provided

4657
03:52:12.60 --> 03:52:17.16
this opportunity for 12 other guys to go down there.

4658
03:52:17.16 --> 03:52:21.12
And at that point, maybe we'll talk about it.

4659
03:52:21.12 --> 03:52:26.000
This one's not one for PR and stepping out of the shadows.

4660
03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:30.52
So this was a big deal, but I thought, well, we're just going to buy ourselves a year here

4661
03:52:30.52 --> 03:52:37.32
and get some really good data and come out with a little bit of foundation beneath us.

4662
03:52:37.32 --> 03:52:40.72
And his treatment was on Veterans Day.

4663
03:52:40.72 --> 03:52:43.40
So November 11th would have been the one year mark.

4664
03:52:43.40 --> 03:52:47.20
Chad Wilkinson took his life on October 28th.

4665
03:52:47.20 --> 03:52:53.96
And we were sitting in his funeral just days before the one year anniversary of Marcus,

4666
03:52:53.96 --> 03:52:56.16
or right around the same time.

4667
03:52:56.16 --> 03:53:02.64
And we had been to the Little Creek Chapel so many times for more funerals.

4668
03:53:02.64 --> 03:53:04.24
And this felt so different.

4669
03:53:04.24 --> 03:53:08.88
And I was seeing all the same guys that would deploy with Marcus and be at all these other

4670
03:53:08.88 --> 03:53:09.88
funerals.

4671
03:53:09.88 --> 03:53:14.80
And they had more medals and they had more gray hair and they had more wrinkles and they

4672
03:53:14.80 --> 03:53:23.40
were getting older and becoming like you could see in their faces that they were struggling.

4673
03:53:23.40 --> 03:53:26.12
And this is the first suicide funeral I'd been to.

4674
03:53:26.12 --> 03:53:27.96
And I started shaking.

4675
03:53:27.96 --> 03:53:35.16
I had this tremble release response at Chad's funeral where I was jackhammering and shaking.

4676
03:53:35.16 --> 03:53:36.56
The whole bench was shaking.

4677
03:53:36.56 --> 03:53:39.32
People were looking down like, what is going on down there?

4678
03:53:39.32 --> 03:53:44.60
And I was just overcome with this conviction of like, if we don't talk, if we don't step

4679
03:53:44.60 --> 03:53:51.000
out and get out of our comfort zone, more guys are going to die by suicide.

4680
03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:56.40
And we're going to just do whatever it takes to prevent that because this community and

4681
03:53:56.40 --> 03:53:58.20
this chapel can't take that.

4682
03:53:58.20 --> 03:54:02.48
So we're not going to let that happen.

4683
03:54:02.48 --> 03:54:08.12
And so we started basically just stopped hiding kind of what we were doing and started speaking

4684
03:54:08.12 --> 03:54:13.12
about it a little bit because we thought, well, if we start speaking about it, you know,

4685
03:54:13.12 --> 03:54:20.16
and of course we talked to Sarah, we just said, hey, we're just going to start talking

4686
03:54:20.16 --> 03:54:22.48
about this a little bit so people know.

4687
03:54:22.48 --> 03:54:27.96
So in the unlikely event that an individual is getting to the point where Chad got to,

4688
03:54:27.96 --> 03:54:30.92
they might pause and go, oh, you know what?

4689
03:54:30.92 --> 03:54:32.44
There's something I haven't tried.

4690
03:54:32.44 --> 03:54:37.56
Or there's this thing that I heard is working for some individuals after, because mostly

4691
03:54:37.56 --> 03:54:40.84
a lot, I mean, most of these individuals are on the same path.

4692
03:54:40.84 --> 03:54:44.76
Like they go to NICO, they go to these brain clinics, they're on a bunch of these mood

4693
03:54:44.76 --> 03:54:46.44
stabilizers.

4694
03:54:46.44 --> 03:54:49.28
And then they're like, okay, well, well now what?

4695
03:54:49.28 --> 03:54:54.12
So I at that point just said, you know, fuck my career, because I was still like trying

4696
03:54:54.12 --> 03:54:59.64
to figure out like to get into corporate America and, you know, whatever.

4697
03:54:59.64 --> 03:55:04.96
I just said, I think this is more important.

4698
03:55:04.96 --> 03:55:10.24
And if someone is not going to hire me or doesn't want to work with me because we're

4699
03:55:10.24 --> 03:55:14.16
talking about psychedelic medicines, then like shame on them.

4700
03:55:14.16 --> 03:55:16.32
Like I don't need, I don't want to work with that individual.

4701
03:55:16.32 --> 03:55:17.68
Like open your mind a little bit.

4702
03:55:17.68 --> 03:55:19.72
We found something that works.

4703
03:55:19.72 --> 03:55:20.92
And that's the story here.

4704
03:55:20.92 --> 03:55:24.68
The story is not Marcus and Amber running around doing psychedelic drugs or running

4705
03:55:24.68 --> 03:55:30.68
a cult, which we were told by the way initially we were running a cult, which is kind of funny.

4706
03:55:30.68 --> 03:55:32.68
But no, we're trying to heal people.

4707
03:55:32.68 --> 03:55:33.68
That's all.

4708
03:55:33.68 --> 03:55:34.68
We found something that worked.

4709
03:55:34.68 --> 03:55:36.44
And that's what happened.

4710
03:55:36.44 --> 03:55:37.44
And so that was it.

4711
03:55:37.44 --> 03:55:39.04
We just started speaking about it.

4712
03:55:39.04 --> 03:55:44.68
We started doing, you know, interview here, interview there, maybe a small podcast, you

4713
03:55:44.68 --> 03:55:47.24
know, and, you know, one thing leads to another.

4714
03:55:47.24 --> 03:55:49.44
People get interested.

4715
03:55:49.44 --> 03:55:51.84
People with money want to donate.

4716
03:55:51.84 --> 03:55:54.28
And you also know how the community is.

4717
03:55:54.28 --> 03:55:59.12
Like what I love most about the community is just this like unwavering commitment to

4718
03:55:59.12 --> 03:56:00.88
caring for one another.

4719
03:56:00.88 --> 03:56:06.64
And for every person that comes through our program, because the efficacy rates are so

4720
03:56:06.64 --> 03:56:07.72
high.

4721
03:56:07.72 --> 03:56:10.60
They refer back three to five of their buddies.

4722
03:56:10.60 --> 03:56:17.32
And so it creates a need that we simply, you know, are having really hard time meeting.

4723
03:56:17.32 --> 03:56:23.84
But to date, we've provided funding for over 600 other operators, not all CLs.

4724
03:56:23.84 --> 03:56:29.88
I mean, we serve all branches of special operations, but, you know, it's really taken on a life

4725
03:56:29.88 --> 03:56:30.88
of its own.

4726
03:56:30.88 --> 03:56:34.68
And it absolutely started at Chad Wilkinson's funeral.

4727
03:56:34.68 --> 03:56:40.16
And this just goal of ending veteran suicide.

4728
03:56:40.16 --> 03:56:45.12
Did you, your original, like when you first came out and started talking about it, that

4729
03:56:45.12 --> 03:56:46.84
was after Chad's funeral?

4730
03:56:46.84 --> 03:56:47.84
Yeah.

4731
03:56:47.84 --> 03:56:56.08
Oh, that at Chad's funeral is whenever I was so convicted of like everything we do, I'm

4732
03:56:56.08 --> 03:57:06.80
keeping Chad Wilkinson and Sarah and the kids right here because the fallout from suicide,

4733
03:57:06.80 --> 03:57:13.32
like to survive all these combat deployments and then lose your loved one to suicide.

4734
03:57:13.32 --> 03:57:16.24
Like, oh, I can't even fathom.

4735
03:57:16.24 --> 03:57:20.80
Like I was just super convicted.

4736
03:57:20.80 --> 03:57:24.52
How long did it take to start getting traction?

4737
03:57:24.52 --> 03:57:27.28
Almost immediately.

4738
03:57:27.28 --> 03:57:28.28
Almost immediately.

4739
03:57:28.28 --> 03:57:32.84
We had gotten traction, mega traction in terms of the need.

4740
03:57:32.84 --> 03:57:37.92
But what didn't necessarily match that was the donor dollars.

4741
03:57:37.92 --> 03:57:38.92
It was very stigmatized.

4742
03:57:38.92 --> 03:57:43.96
I mean, we're talking about four years ago at this point.

4743
03:57:43.96 --> 03:57:46.000
It was still very stigmatized and unknown.

4744
03:57:46.000 --> 03:57:50.32
Like there's a lot of, there's a lack of education around psychedelic therapies and then there's

4745
03:57:50.32 --> 03:57:52.52
misinformation around psychedelics.

4746
03:57:52.52 --> 03:57:56.96
And so to combat those two stigmas and to also try to combat the stigma of saying you

4747
03:57:56.96 --> 03:58:00.68
need help, it's been like, you know, pretty dicey.

4748
03:58:00.68 --> 03:58:01.68
Yeah.

4749
03:58:01.68 --> 03:58:03.44
That's a war on all fronts right there.

4750
03:58:03.44 --> 03:58:04.44
Yeah.

4751
03:58:04.44 --> 03:58:05.44
Yeah.

4752
03:58:05.44 --> 03:58:11.52
Well, then you go into the real fun war of like military leadership and policymakers

4753
03:58:11.52 --> 03:58:15.28
and big pharma and VA and, you know.

4754
03:58:15.28 --> 03:58:19.72
But it seems like it's getting really good traction right now.

4755
03:58:19.72 --> 03:58:21.24
Is it, isn't it?

4756
03:58:21.24 --> 03:58:22.24
Yeah.

4757
03:58:22.24 --> 03:58:23.24
Yeah.

4758
03:58:23.24 --> 03:58:27.28
Because veterans are driving it and the veterans driving it at the tip tip of the spear is

4759
03:58:27.28 --> 03:58:30.52
the seal community and the broader special operations community.

4760
03:58:30.52 --> 03:58:36.84
And like, I don't know if I needed to get something done, I'd call you guys.

4761
03:58:36.84 --> 03:58:41.000
So the charity is called, well, you got on your t-shirt there, right?

4762
03:58:41.000 --> 03:58:42.56
It's VETS solutions.

4763
03:58:42.56 --> 03:58:43.56
Yeah.

4764
03:58:43.56 --> 03:58:44.56
Right.

4765
03:58:44.56 --> 03:58:46.20
VETS, veterans exploring treatment solutions.

4766
03:58:46.20 --> 03:58:49.32
And it's vet solutions.org.

4767
03:58:49.32 --> 03:58:54.60
If people want to go and check that out and can they donate from there and all that.

4768
03:58:54.60 --> 03:58:57.84
And so what's the plan there on that side of things?

4769
03:58:57.84 --> 03:59:02.44
Just continue to grow, continue to accept donations, continue to get more people treatment.

4770
03:59:02.44 --> 03:59:08.52
Jocko, we get upwards of 10 qualified applications a day needing funding.

4771
03:59:08.52 --> 03:59:09.52
A day.

4772
03:59:09.52 --> 03:59:12.56
And it is so overwhelming.

4773
03:59:12.56 --> 03:59:15.76
Like I actually dread it when we have to go through applications.

4774
03:59:15.76 --> 03:59:24.20
We do it on Mondays and we have a certain number of grants or funds allocated.

4775
03:59:24.20 --> 03:59:28.12
And choosing who gets those funds when everyone is so deserving.

4776
03:59:28.12 --> 03:59:29.12
It's like...

4777
03:59:29.12 --> 03:59:33.64
So we actually, I mean, we actually have to, you know, we had an algorithm built in to

4778
03:59:33.64 --> 03:59:37.44
like rack and stack who's done the most combat deployments.

4779
03:59:37.44 --> 03:59:38.44
Like what are they going through?

4780
03:59:38.44 --> 03:59:42.32
So it actually, you know, it ranks the individuals, you know, or if there's like an immediate

4781
03:59:42.32 --> 03:59:45.72
crisis, they immediately get put to the top and they get a phone call immediately.

4782
03:59:45.72 --> 03:59:49.48
And so there's a whole, you know, there's a whole system to it because again, of those

4783
03:59:49.48 --> 03:59:57.12
10, if we're talking about only being able to support 175 to 200 a year, there's a, you

4784
03:59:57.12 --> 04:00:00.88
know, there's most of those people are not getting funding.

4785
04:00:00.88 --> 04:00:10.28
There are thousands, tens of thousands that could use it or need it or are trying to access

4786
04:00:10.28 --> 04:00:11.28
it.

4787
04:00:11.28 --> 04:00:15.72
And so if they're, or schedule one substances in the United States, they have to travel

4788
04:00:15.72 --> 04:00:16.72
abroad.

4789
04:00:16.72 --> 04:00:20.64
So, you know, one of our, I would say most effective talking points when we're talking

4790
04:00:20.64 --> 04:00:28.76
to policy makers and leader leaders is that, you know, our nation's veterans are leaving

4791
04:00:28.76 --> 04:00:31.72
the country they fought for for access to meaningful care.

4792
04:00:31.72 --> 04:00:36.64
And this is so far superior to anything else that's currently available, at least from

4793
04:00:36.64 --> 04:00:41.80
my perspective, what I'm seeing is there's healing happening in four key areas of veteran

4794
04:00:41.80 --> 04:00:42.80
suffering.

4795
04:00:42.80 --> 04:00:46.28
And so when we were in such a bad way, if you would have given me immediate relief in

4796
04:00:46.28 --> 04:00:50.16
one of the four areas, it would have been an absolute blessing.

4797
04:00:50.16 --> 04:00:54.96
The fact that it provides immediate relief for most people in all four categories is

4798
04:00:54.96 --> 04:00:56.12
unheard of.

4799
04:00:56.12 --> 04:00:59.32
So the first category is psychological trauma.

4800
04:00:59.32 --> 04:01:03.36
So anything that's affecting someone, you know, even on a subconscious level, whether

4801
04:01:03.36 --> 04:01:13.12
it's childhood trauma, repressed trauma that, you know, they don't even remember war trauma,

4802
04:01:13.12 --> 04:01:15.44
whatever the source of trauma is, it deals with that.

4803
04:01:15.44 --> 04:01:19.44
And like Marcus said, it shows you the trauma and then you're able to work through it, confront

4804
04:01:19.44 --> 04:01:23.20
it, deal with it, put it away, be done with it.

4805
04:01:23.20 --> 04:01:28.12
There's an anti-addictive benefit, which is really ironic because these drugs are scheduled

4806
04:01:28.12 --> 04:01:32.44
as being addictive and like a high potential for abuse.

4807
04:01:32.44 --> 04:01:38.12
They're actually being used to treat addiction, but because they're so challenging to even

4808
04:01:38.12 --> 04:01:41.96
research in the United States, that data is largely missing.

4809
04:01:41.96 --> 04:01:46.80
So Marcus and, you know, so many other guys that are going down there might not have a

4810
04:01:46.80 --> 04:01:51.44
full blown addiction, but they have substance use disorder.

4811
04:01:51.44 --> 04:01:53.000
And so for Marcus, it was alcohol.

4812
04:01:53.000 --> 04:01:57.12
Some guys go down there because they're hooked on opioids.

4813
04:01:57.12 --> 04:02:06.24
However the addiction is, it like resets, it scrubs and resets those receptors and the

4814
04:02:06.24 --> 04:02:12.24
addiction, you know, no longer has that brand.

4815
04:02:12.24 --> 04:02:16.60
There's a physiological benefit as it pertains to TBI.

4816
04:02:16.60 --> 04:02:22.40
At VETS, we primarily write grants for Ibogaine and 5MEO DMT protocol.

4817
04:02:22.40 --> 04:02:26.28
That's two of the six psychedelics that we can provide funding for.

4818
04:02:26.28 --> 04:02:30.40
Most guys are going down there to do Ibogaine and 5MEO.

4819
04:02:30.40 --> 04:02:33.24
We're just wrapping up a study with Stanford.

4820
04:02:33.24 --> 04:02:38.12
The preliminary data is not released yet, but I think that it will show significant improvements

4821
04:02:38.12 --> 04:02:40.84
in cognitive functioning, neurological functioning.

4822
04:02:40.84 --> 04:02:44.56
It creates this really incredible neuroplasticity in the brain.

4823
04:02:44.56 --> 04:02:50.44
The brain's ability to change itself, create new neural pathways, neuronal connections.

4824
04:02:50.44 --> 04:02:54.24
You know, whatever it's doing in the brain as it relates to TBI is pretty remarkable.

4825
04:02:54.24 --> 04:02:57.28
In our Stanford study, I think we'll prove that.

4826
04:02:57.28 --> 04:03:03.92
The fourth thing is a spiritual connection or reconnection.

4827
04:03:03.92 --> 04:03:07.84
And I think that that's what science will never be able to fully explain.

4828
04:03:07.84 --> 04:03:15.08
That when someone feels as though they're put on this earth by a higher power and we're

4829
04:03:15.08 --> 04:03:21.28
all connected and like, you know, we're all humans and we're alive and the grass is alive

4830
04:03:21.28 --> 04:03:24.76
and the flowers are alive and the animals are alive and you see that you're part of

4831
04:03:24.76 --> 04:03:30.92
this really incredible, huge ecosystem of purpose and perfection.

4832
04:03:30.92 --> 04:03:39.52
You feel as though you have a place to belong again and you feel this God connection that

4833
04:03:39.52 --> 04:03:45.92
I think is the answer to a lot of society's issues right now.

4834
04:03:45.92 --> 04:03:51.52
So psychological, anti-addictive, physiological and spiritual.

4835
04:03:51.52 --> 04:03:56.24
When you check all four of those boxes, you go home like, I feel pretty good.

4836
04:03:56.24 --> 04:04:01.72
Now on the back end of this, there's a lot of things that are really important.

4837
04:04:01.72 --> 04:04:06.64
So we're screening another one of our screening categories is like, how committed are you

4838
04:04:06.64 --> 04:04:07.74
to this?

4839
04:04:07.74 --> 04:04:10.68
Because we've got guys come into us that say, I don't know anything about this, my buddy

4840
04:04:10.68 --> 04:04:11.68
said to do it.

4841
04:04:11.68 --> 04:04:16.52
And then we've got guys that say, I've been researching this for a year and I've changed

4842
04:04:16.52 --> 04:04:20.28
my diet and I'm really committed to working with a coach.

4843
04:04:20.28 --> 04:04:22.56
Those of the guys are going to have the best chance for success.

4844
04:04:22.56 --> 04:04:28.12
The spouse support is another huge factor in overall trajectory and success.

4845
04:04:28.12 --> 04:04:35.48
So you know, it's every, the psychedelic just provides this massive reset.

4846
04:04:35.48 --> 04:04:41.72
And then when you get someone like from fetal position to one knee, like they can stand

4847
04:04:41.72 --> 04:04:45.20
up and take it from there, especially guys like you guys.

4848
04:04:45.20 --> 04:04:51.20
So guys are leading these weeks with this checklist of now what?

4849
04:04:51.20 --> 04:04:52.96
Cause now I feel great again.

4850
04:04:52.96 --> 04:04:58.48
And so for Marcus and for hundreds of others at this point, you're feeling good and you're

4851
04:04:58.48 --> 04:05:01.96
feeling like, you know, suddenly you've got a thousand pounds lifted off of you.

4852
04:05:01.96 --> 04:05:04.32
You're sleeping better when you're sleeping better, you're getting up early and getting

4853
04:05:04.32 --> 04:05:07.40
up early, you can work out now and you work out, you want to take supplements and you

4854
04:05:07.40 --> 04:05:09.40
take supplements, you might as well eat, right?

4855
04:05:09.40 --> 04:05:19.52
And it just becomes the sort of like self-propelling biohacking snowball effect in the very best

4856
04:05:19.52 --> 04:05:20.52
ways.

4857
04:05:20.52 --> 04:05:24.96
And those are the guys that are going, you know, through these remarkable changes.

4858
04:05:24.96 --> 04:05:28.60
But for anyone that would think like, oh, you're just going to Mexico to do drugs.

4859
04:05:28.60 --> 04:05:29.60
Uh-uh.

4860
04:05:29.60 --> 04:05:30.60
No, no, no.

4861
04:05:30.60 --> 04:05:36.56
People that are going down there are leaning into the hardest work of their lives and actually

4862
04:05:36.56 --> 04:05:44.44
having to come face to face with things that they might have been running from for decades.

4863
04:05:44.44 --> 04:05:51.48
She's being conservative about the Stanford study too, but it's the results are remarkable,

4864
04:05:51.48 --> 04:05:56.56
like so remarkable that I think there's going to be a lot of eyes on it once they release

4865
04:05:56.56 --> 04:05:58.56
it to the public Wednesday.

4866
04:05:58.56 --> 04:05:59.56
No, no, no.

4867
04:05:59.56 --> 04:06:00.56
No, no, no, no.

4868
04:06:00.56 --> 04:06:02.44
It won't be published for quite some time.

4869
04:06:02.44 --> 04:06:06.12
It won't be published, but we're going up there Wednesday just to, they're going to

4870
04:06:06.12 --> 04:06:11.88
talk about the results officially, but not just from the reduction of symptoms, like

4871
04:06:11.88 --> 04:06:18.84
what we were talking about earlier, but also the FMRIs that are coming out before and after

4872
04:06:18.84 --> 04:06:19.84
are like astounding.

4873
04:06:19.84 --> 04:06:20.84
It'll be groundbreaking.

4874
04:06:20.84 --> 04:06:23.000
It won't just be groundbreaking for veterans.

4875
04:06:23.000 --> 04:06:29.32
It'll be groundbreaking for contact sport athletes, for first responders.

4876
04:06:29.32 --> 04:06:32.96
They're Alzheimer's patients, for Parkinson's patients.

4877
04:06:32.96 --> 04:06:40.92
The changes in the brain on the physiological level, I hypothesize that there's not been

4878
04:06:40.92 --> 04:06:43.60
anything like it to date.

4879
04:06:43.60 --> 04:06:50.72
Marcus, when you, I'm dragging you back real quick.

4880
04:06:50.72 --> 04:06:59.48
But give me an example of what you see, you said bloody gory.

4881
04:06:59.48 --> 04:07:06.64
Number one, do you know that it's psychedelic?

4882
04:07:06.64 --> 04:07:09.36
Or does it feel like it's a real thing?

4883
04:07:09.36 --> 04:07:16.000
And like, give me just an example, just any example, just so people kind of can connect

4884
04:07:16.000 --> 04:07:24.000
all these positive things to like what you see when you're on this journey.

4885
04:07:24.000 --> 04:07:25.000
Yes.

4886
04:07:25.000 --> 04:07:26.000
There you go.

4887
04:07:26.000 --> 04:07:28.000
I tried hard not to use the word trip.

4888
04:07:28.000 --> 04:07:30.56
I'm sure that's actually, we're trying not to call this thing trip.

4889
04:07:30.56 --> 04:07:31.56
I picked that up.

4890
04:07:31.56 --> 04:07:32.56
So it's funny.

4891
04:07:32.56 --> 04:07:36.32
It's funny you say that because, you know, obviously we're around the whole kind of medical

4892
04:07:36.32 --> 04:07:41.64
psychedelic community now and you hear all these things or how they correct people because,

4893
04:07:41.64 --> 04:07:44.32
you know, a politician doesn't want to hear like drug.

4894
04:07:44.32 --> 04:07:48.44
There's one here psychedelic, they immediately think of wood stock or, you know, right?

4895
04:07:48.44 --> 04:07:50.48
So you know, we've been doing the same thing.

4896
04:07:50.48 --> 04:07:53.72
Like we say this, we don't say that, you know, it all means the same thing.

4897
04:07:53.72 --> 04:07:55.52
So I appreciate that.

4898
04:07:55.52 --> 04:08:01.80
I'll make a very simple one and one that's not bloody or gory.

4899
04:08:01.80 --> 04:08:11.40
My one of my close friends, his experience is he, he was sitting down and each individual

4900
04:08:11.40 --> 04:08:20.60
from extortion was like dressed in white and would sit down and put their hand on his shoulder

4901
04:08:20.60 --> 04:08:22.68
and say, Hey man, it's okay.

4902
04:08:22.68 --> 04:08:23.68
Like I'm good.

4903
04:08:23.68 --> 04:08:25.20
Like you can let me go now.

4904
04:08:25.20 --> 04:08:30.44
But he had the conversation with that person and he would look at him and go, Yeah, okay.

4905
04:08:30.44 --> 04:08:35.12
And then that guy would go and then another guy from extortion would sit down dressed

4906
04:08:35.12 --> 04:08:38.60
in white and say, Hey man, I'm good.

4907
04:08:38.60 --> 04:08:39.92
Like I'm good.

4908
04:08:39.92 --> 04:08:45.64
I'm in a good place and then that person would go and each person that he was like, obviously

4909
04:08:45.64 --> 04:08:52.16
having whatever this person was dealing with had to do with all the buddies he just lost

4910
04:08:52.16 --> 04:08:54.24
on that Hilo.

4911
04:08:54.24 --> 04:09:01.64
And once that was gone, again, he just dealt with whatever that was his trauma.

4912
04:09:01.64 --> 04:09:05.52
It may have been locked back into subconscious as Amber mentioned, but that's what he was

4913
04:09:05.52 --> 04:09:08.20
dealing with in life.

4914
04:09:08.20 --> 04:09:12.40
And once he faced them and talked to them and they talked to him and they told him it

4915
04:09:12.40 --> 04:09:14.12
was okay.

4916
04:09:14.12 --> 04:09:15.12
He's okay.

4917
04:09:15.12 --> 04:09:16.52
Like he's not bad anymore.

4918
04:09:16.52 --> 04:09:19.28
Like he let he let that shit go.

4919
04:09:19.28 --> 04:09:25.28
And I, you know, we hear these stories like over and over and over again and it's, you

4920
04:09:25.28 --> 04:09:28.72
know, it's, it's they're all different, but they're all the same.

4921
04:09:28.72 --> 04:09:32.56
And I think that's what's, you know, pretty remarkable about it.

4922
04:09:32.56 --> 04:09:36.000
I've developed some of my own theories, whether they're true or not.

4923
04:09:36.000 --> 04:09:41.88
I don't know every has theories as we're science hasn't proven my theories, but my theory is

4924
04:09:41.88 --> 04:09:48.40
that whatever the trauma response is, it goes back to the origination of the trauma.

4925
04:09:48.40 --> 04:09:56.000
And some people channel that trauma in ways that society deems unhealthy versus healthier.

4926
04:09:56.000 --> 04:10:00.12
I feel like what I've seen in the special operations community is that is something in

4927
04:10:00.12 --> 04:10:06.64
the early childhood has like enabled this sort of like dialing down of suffering.

4928
04:10:06.64 --> 04:10:12.08
Like, like you just, the community is able to maintain such suffering.

4929
04:10:12.08 --> 04:10:18.08
And so a lot of guys I've felt are going way back to childhood and dealing with like sort

4930
04:10:18.08 --> 04:10:19.96
of repressed things.

4931
04:10:19.96 --> 04:10:24.16
And I don't know, Marcus, if you want to tell any of her stories, like about your actual

4932
04:10:24.16 --> 04:10:28.72
experience of going back to actual memories and childhood, but then also to your question

4933
04:10:28.72 --> 04:10:35.16
jocco on why the blood in the gore, I also feel like when you're in the face of evil,

4934
04:10:35.16 --> 04:10:38.80
they'll sort of can stick to you.

4935
04:10:38.80 --> 04:10:50.72
And Marcus had to get through some really dark, very demonic, you know, heaviness to

4936
04:10:50.72 --> 04:10:52.72
come out on the other side.

4937
04:10:52.72 --> 04:10:55.20
And he's been back to do Ibogaine's sins.

4938
04:10:55.20 --> 04:10:57.92
He's like basically does this annual protocol reset.

4939
04:10:57.92 --> 04:10:59.80
Or like every year and a half.

4940
04:10:59.80 --> 04:11:00.80
Yeah.

4941
04:11:00.80 --> 04:11:07.52
And so if he started in the basement of his soul, every year he gets a floor higher.

4942
04:11:07.52 --> 04:11:14.52
And the last time he did Ibogaine, which would be their fourth time, he described it as blissful.

4943
04:11:14.52 --> 04:11:16.60
So yeah, so it wasn't, it wasn't painful.

4944
04:11:16.60 --> 04:11:18.16
It wasn't tough.

4945
04:11:18.16 --> 04:11:19.16
It wasn't angry.

4946
04:11:19.16 --> 04:11:22.04
And I didn't feel like I was like, you know, fighting demons.

4947
04:11:22.04 --> 04:11:24.48
You hear a lot of guys, I mean, they talk about literally like fighting demons.

4948
04:11:24.48 --> 04:11:25.48
There's none of that.

4949
04:11:25.48 --> 04:11:32.24
It was just kind of like peaceful and surreal and not tough.

4950
04:11:32.24 --> 04:11:35.20
And what it told me is like, I'm good.

4951
04:11:35.20 --> 04:11:39.60
Like I think I've scrubbed whatever I needed to scrub.

4952
04:11:39.60 --> 04:11:40.60
You scrubbed the darkness.

4953
04:11:40.60 --> 04:11:41.60
Yeah.

4954
04:11:41.60 --> 04:11:46.000
You know, you kind of just got rid of any of the garbage that I think was, you know,

4955
04:11:46.000 --> 04:11:47.52
affecting me.

4956
04:11:47.52 --> 04:11:50.60
And so, I mean, I'm like, I'm light now.

4957
04:11:50.60 --> 04:11:52.92
Like I don't have nightmares anymore.

4958
04:11:52.92 --> 04:11:56.40
I mean, I think that was like a lot of the blood and gore or like, you know, you'd go

4959
04:11:56.40 --> 04:12:01.72
to try to pull the trigger and like the magazine would fall out or like the barrel would melt.

4960
04:12:01.72 --> 04:12:04.48
Like just all the dumb stuff.

4961
04:12:04.48 --> 04:12:10.44
Like I don't have, I don't have those visions anymore.

4962
04:12:10.44 --> 04:12:11.68
It is and some of it is funny.

4963
04:12:11.68 --> 04:12:14.56
I mean, if you hear some of the stories, you're like, man, that's fucking hilarious.

4964
04:12:14.56 --> 04:12:15.56
Right?

4965
04:12:15.56 --> 04:12:17.56
Especially like team guys talking about their funny stories.

4966
04:12:17.56 --> 04:12:19.44
I'm laughing because like everyone has that dream.

4967
04:12:19.44 --> 04:12:20.44
They do.

4968
04:12:20.44 --> 04:12:21.44
Like you're out of bullets.

4969
04:12:21.44 --> 04:12:22.44
100%.

4970
04:12:22.44 --> 04:12:24.72
Like somebody 100 times and they're just like, look at you.

4971
04:12:24.72 --> 04:12:25.72
Yeah.

4972
04:12:25.72 --> 04:12:26.72
I'm sure you get more pissed off.

4973
04:12:26.72 --> 04:12:27.72
You're like, wait a minute.

4974
04:12:27.72 --> 04:12:29.64
I'm really good at fighting.

4975
04:12:29.64 --> 04:12:31.96
Why can't I knock you out in my dream?

4976
04:12:31.96 --> 04:12:33.52
Yeah, exactly.

4977
04:12:33.52 --> 04:12:39.40
So we are trying to get this to as many veterans as we can.

4978
04:12:39.40 --> 04:12:41.32
That's what you guys are working on right now.

4979
04:12:41.32 --> 04:12:48.40
And you were telling me earlier, you're also looking to take this in a direction private

4980
04:12:48.40 --> 04:12:49.40
as well.

4981
04:12:49.40 --> 04:12:50.40
Yes.

4982
04:12:50.40 --> 04:12:51.80
Like as a privately owned company.

4983
04:12:51.80 --> 04:12:52.80
Yeah.

4984
04:12:52.80 --> 04:12:57.68
So, as Amber was alluding to earlier, the amount of applications we get a day, those are just

4985
04:12:57.68 --> 04:12:58.68
from veterans.

4986
04:12:58.68 --> 04:13:06.08
The amount of individuals that reach out via Instagram or Facebook or really LinkedIn

4987
04:13:06.08 --> 04:13:08.12
and LinkedIn is like a professional network.

4988
04:13:08.12 --> 04:13:15.28
So a lot of corporate, a lot of CEOs and entrepreneurs just asking, hey, how do I do this?

4989
04:13:15.28 --> 04:13:17.88
I heard you talk on so and so.

4990
04:13:17.88 --> 04:13:20.72
Where do I go to find these treatments?

4991
04:13:20.72 --> 04:13:23.40
And you introduced me to a coach or a therapist.

4992
04:13:23.40 --> 04:13:28.48
And so the more that I saw over the last two years, I just said, Amber, when we started

4993
04:13:28.48 --> 04:13:34.92
this, we said, hey, we want to help our teammates first, team guys, but we want to help all

4994
04:13:34.92 --> 04:13:35.92
the special operations.

4995
04:13:35.92 --> 04:13:37.56
And then we want to help all the veterans.

4996
04:13:37.56 --> 04:13:46.36
And then we want to help athletes, like NFL players, at 99% of the brains they found autopsied

4997
04:13:46.36 --> 04:13:52.64
from the individuals that have took their own life or all had CTE.

4998
04:13:52.64 --> 04:13:53.64
We want to help those individuals.

4999
04:13:53.64 --> 04:13:55.36
We said, you know what?

5000
04:13:55.36 --> 04:13:58.88
We want to help anyone that is going through the same thing.

5001
04:13:58.88 --> 04:14:00.52
And again, it's not everyone.

5002
04:14:00.52 --> 04:14:03.84
It's just everyone that is struggling the same way.

5003
04:14:03.84 --> 04:14:07.52
And that was kind of like my vision a long time ago is, I want to start with veterans

5004
04:14:07.52 --> 04:14:12.68
and help our brothers and sisters, but I want to help everybody.

5005
04:14:12.68 --> 04:14:19.32
And it took the interest of some VC that started donating to Vets and just said, hey, I really

5006
04:14:19.32 --> 04:14:20.48
love what you're doing.

5007
04:14:20.48 --> 04:14:21.96
Like I think this is needed.

5008
04:14:21.96 --> 04:14:25.52
You know, I understand personalized medicine.

5009
04:14:25.52 --> 04:14:28.84
How do we take this and introduce it to the broader population and reach more people?

5010
04:14:28.84 --> 04:14:30.28
And I said, well, let's work on that.

5011
04:14:30.28 --> 04:14:34.04
So I've been working on that for a year and we're actually launching this week.

5012
04:14:34.04 --> 04:14:38.76
And the company's called Tara, T-A-R-A, Tara Mind.

5013
04:14:38.76 --> 04:14:43.12
The website will be TaraMind.com.

5014
04:14:43.12 --> 04:14:49.04
Right now we'll have a, we basically have a landing and info page for people to go to

5015
04:14:49.04 --> 04:14:54.12
and just put in some information and they'll start getting some, you know, some newsletters

5016
04:14:54.12 --> 04:14:56.80
and some info.

5017
04:14:56.80 --> 04:15:02.60
But launching at the end of this year or it'll be, you know, the first couple of weeks of

5018
04:15:02.60 --> 04:15:14.64
January, we're launching a care navigation and directory and basically a platform for

5019
04:15:14.64 --> 04:15:23.32
psychedelic retreats, clinics, providers, coaches, basically a marketplace to connect

5020
04:15:23.32 --> 04:15:24.60
all these individuals.

5021
04:15:24.60 --> 04:15:29.08
And so the individuals that are reaching out to us on a regular basis and saying, hey,

5022
04:15:29.08 --> 04:15:30.08
where do I go?

5023
04:15:30.08 --> 04:15:31.08
What do I do?

5024
04:15:31.08 --> 04:15:32.08
We're building that platform for them.

5025
04:15:32.08 --> 04:15:35.80
And, you know, we're going to provide educational content.

5026
04:15:35.80 --> 04:15:41.36
We're going to vet everything and have, you know, high standards and protocols that, you

5027
04:15:41.36 --> 04:15:47.36
know, that these providers in the U.S. that are doing this right now, it's going to be

5028
04:15:47.36 --> 04:15:52.40
ketamine, ketamine assisted psychotherapy because that's the only thing that's legal.

5029
04:15:52.40 --> 04:15:56.60
So we're just, you know, the vision really is to build the largest platform in the world

5030
04:15:56.60 --> 04:15:59.40
to connect all, you know, all the stakeholders.

5031
04:15:59.40 --> 04:16:05.56
And eventually we will be collecting data on all these individuals and we will be going

5032
04:16:05.56 --> 04:16:09.48
to insurers and making sure at the end of the day that they pay for these because right

5033
04:16:09.48 --> 04:16:14.60
now not everybody can pay $6,000 to go outside the U.S. and do it.

5034
04:16:14.60 --> 04:16:16.84
Right now it's like the top 1% can do it.

5035
04:16:16.84 --> 04:16:21.96
Or if you're a nonprofit, you know, and you raise money for this, you know, then an individual

5036
04:16:21.96 --> 04:16:22.96
can go.

5037
04:16:22.96 --> 04:16:25.52
But again, we're supporting 200 people a year.

5038
04:16:25.52 --> 04:16:27.52
How do you support 20 million?

5039
04:16:27.52 --> 04:16:28.72
Insurance is going to have to pay for that.

5040
04:16:28.72 --> 04:16:35.04
So the idea with TARA Mind is we collect, we connect all the stakeholders in psychedelic

5041
04:16:35.04 --> 04:16:39.96
medicine and then eventually we go to insurers and show them the data and say, hey, this

5042
04:16:39.96 --> 04:16:40.96
is working.

5043
04:16:40.96 --> 04:16:44.08
You need to offer this up now as a benefit and pay for these individuals and subsidize

5044
04:16:44.08 --> 04:16:45.08
these treatments.

5045
04:16:45.08 --> 04:16:46.08
So.

5046
04:16:46.08 --> 04:16:47.08
TARA Mind.

5047
04:16:47.08 --> 04:16:48.08
TARA Mind, doc.

5048
04:16:48.08 --> 04:16:49.08
TARA Mind.

5049
04:16:49.08 --> 04:17:03.16
TARA is one of the highest, the most, I guess you want to call it, important deities in

5050
04:17:03.16 --> 04:17:10.52
Buddhist and Hindu traditions and it's a goddess of, you know, of empathy and bringing people

5051
04:17:10.52 --> 04:17:14.80
to the light and those in suffering to bring them to deliverance.

5052
04:17:14.80 --> 04:17:21.88
So it's kind of a, kind of a, I thought a cool name, especially where it kind of, we

5053
04:17:21.88 --> 04:17:24.48
came from and where we're going and what it's doing to people.

5054
04:17:24.48 --> 04:17:25.48
So.

5055
04:17:25.48 --> 04:17:27.20
And the URL was available.

5056
04:17:27.20 --> 04:17:30.60
And the URL was available for I think $12 actually.

5057
04:17:30.60 --> 04:17:36.32
Well, it sounds like like we're kind of up to date then, right?

5058
04:17:36.32 --> 04:17:38.52
This thing is launching in a couple of days.

5059
04:17:38.52 --> 04:17:43.64
We talked about vet solutions, vet solutions.org.

5060
04:17:43.64 --> 04:17:45.40
You're on social media.

5061
04:17:45.40 --> 04:17:50.000
You're on, you're at Marcus, you're at Marcus Capone.

5062
04:17:50.000 --> 04:17:52.12
Then you guys have, am I right?

5063
04:17:52.12 --> 04:17:54.48
Marcus underscore Amber underscore Capone.

5064
04:17:54.48 --> 04:17:55.48
TARA Yeah.

5065
04:17:55.48 --> 04:17:56.48
What's the deal with that?

5066
04:17:56.48 --> 04:17:57.88
TARA I started that Instagram page.

5067
04:17:57.88 --> 04:18:01.12
Oh, listen, we both like low the social media.

5068
04:18:01.12 --> 04:18:05.36
So we're really not on it that much, but we definitely have help with our social media

5069
04:18:05.36 --> 04:18:10.36
accounts because we want to make sure that we're providing information to others that

5070
04:18:10.36 --> 04:18:11.36
are interested.

5071
04:18:11.36 --> 04:18:16.12
Psychedelic therapies are poised to be the next major breakthrough in mental health care.

5072
04:18:16.12 --> 04:18:21.88
So SSRIs were the last major breakthrough in mental health care 35 years ago.

5073
04:18:21.88 --> 04:18:22.88
Yeah.

5074
04:18:22.88 --> 04:18:28.92
And they're really, you know, for some they work, but you know, there is that warning

5075
04:18:28.92 --> 04:18:36.32
label on the side of SSRI prescriptions that says this may trigger like an uptake, up increase

5076
04:18:36.32 --> 04:18:37.32
in suicidal ideations.

5077
04:18:37.32 --> 04:18:41.04
Well, why are we fighting better in suicide with anything linked to suicide?

5078
04:18:41.04 --> 04:18:42.72
Like that's so asinine to me.

5079
04:18:42.72 --> 04:18:49.64
So as veterans continue to drive this forward in the United States, I certainly feel like

5080
04:18:49.64 --> 04:18:54.36
psychedelics are poised to come on on the scene a lot faster than maybe some had initially

5081
04:18:54.36 --> 04:18:55.36
anticipated.

5082
04:18:55.36 --> 04:18:56.36
Yeah.

5083
04:18:56.36 --> 04:18:59.60
Especially with some of the conservative, you know, lawmakers that are coming out now,

5084
04:18:59.60 --> 04:19:04.68
you know, Dan, you know, French Rose put a, you know, put through an amendment to provide

5085
04:19:04.68 --> 04:19:10.44
funding not for veterans, but actually, and this was I think a complete surprise for everybody

5086
04:19:10.44 --> 04:19:11.96
for active duty.

5087
04:19:11.96 --> 04:19:15.56
So he thinks active duty should have access to this if they need it.

5088
04:19:15.56 --> 04:19:19.80
And of course, you know, Governor Rick Perry, who's been in our corner from day one, you

5089
04:19:19.80 --> 04:19:22.16
know, he helped us pass the bill in Texas.

5090
04:19:22.16 --> 04:19:26.64
And he's just been a strong component or proponent of what we're doing.

5091
04:19:26.64 --> 04:19:29.80
Again, because it's a tool that works, you know, that's all he cares about.

5092
04:19:29.80 --> 04:19:34.08
That's it's really good to see the open mind of people realizing that this thing.

5093
04:19:34.08 --> 04:19:35.08
And that's the same thing.

5094
04:19:35.08 --> 04:19:40.24
I've seen, you know, I've had some good friends had Dakota Meyer come on here and like he actually

5095
04:19:40.24 --> 04:19:46.12
he, I think, I think I talked about this on the podcast, but you know, he asked me like,

5096
04:19:46.12 --> 04:19:47.60
Hey, do you think I should do something?

5097
04:19:47.60 --> 04:19:49.44
Dude, I have no idea.

5098
04:19:49.44 --> 04:19:52.44
So I called like Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss.

5099
04:19:52.44 --> 04:19:54.48
And I was like, Hey, you know, like, what do you guys think?

5100
04:19:54.48 --> 04:19:56.48
They're like, I like this.

5101
04:19:56.48 --> 04:20:01.52
They actually know they both were like, were thoughtful about it.

5102
04:20:01.52 --> 04:20:09.04
And Joe had had Dakota on the podcast and he was like, he was like, Yeah, I think I

5103
04:20:09.04 --> 04:20:10.60
like, I think it would be good for him.

5104
04:20:10.60 --> 04:20:11.60
And I was like, cool.

5105
04:20:11.60 --> 04:20:14.16
And I said, Hey, man, I'm in no position to recommend the stuff.

5106
04:20:14.16 --> 04:20:17.04
But here's what I got from my friends that know more about the stuff.

5107
04:20:17.04 --> 04:20:22.72
And you know, Tim Ferriss is really involved in, you know, the Johns Hopkins stuff that's

5108
04:20:22.72 --> 04:20:23.72
going on.

5109
04:20:23.72 --> 04:20:28.40
So I feel like at least I, you know, I'm never a person that claims to know anything.

5110
04:20:28.40 --> 04:20:29.40
I don't know.

5111
04:20:29.40 --> 04:20:32.20
I mean, I don't ever want to do that.

5112
04:20:32.20 --> 04:20:36.32
But I talked to people that, you know, gave the best recommendation from their perspective,

5113
04:20:36.32 --> 04:20:40.76
which, and, and he went down there and he did it and he said it was awesome, man.

5114
04:20:40.76 --> 04:20:42.96
And it really helped them out a lot.

5115
04:20:42.96 --> 04:20:47.08
And, and I mean, that guy's been through the freaking ringer, you know, just been through

5116
04:20:47.08 --> 04:20:50.56
the ringer as, you know, losing his freaking team.

5117
04:20:50.56 --> 04:20:54.96
And, man, and he came back in a much better spot.

5118
04:20:54.96 --> 04:21:00.24
So when I see things like that, and then you have like a real conservative, like, you know,

5119
04:21:00.24 --> 04:21:04.24
Rick Perry just like on board.

5120
04:21:04.24 --> 04:21:05.72
That's just really cool to see.

5121
04:21:05.72 --> 04:21:09.000
And Dan's obviously, you know, he's got friends that have done it.

5122
04:21:09.000 --> 04:21:12.32
And for, you know, he's, he's taking it forward.

5123
04:21:12.32 --> 04:21:14.60
So, yeah, I think it's true leadership.

5124
04:21:14.60 --> 04:21:15.84
You know, that's what I say.

5125
04:21:15.84 --> 04:21:20.32
Because again, I don't think I'm sure the state were exactly like I was like, this doesn't

5126
04:21:20.32 --> 04:21:21.32
sound right.

5127
04:21:21.32 --> 04:21:22.32
This is crazy.

5128
04:21:22.32 --> 04:21:26.48
And then you do some research, you talk, really, you talk to friends and then you have like

5129
04:21:26.48 --> 04:21:30.04
loved ones that you see have gotten better.

5130
04:21:30.04 --> 04:21:31.24
It's the only decision to make.

5131
04:21:31.24 --> 04:21:32.60
But again, to do it the right way.

5132
04:21:32.60 --> 04:21:36.40
And I'm glad that you talk to people like Tim, you know, and Joe Rogan.

5133
04:21:36.40 --> 04:21:38.72
And I'm glad they didn't just say, oh, yeah, go ahead and do it.

5134
04:21:38.72 --> 04:21:42.36
Like they were like, well, let's, you know, and we've seen that with some of the retreats.

5135
04:21:42.36 --> 04:21:47.96
Because again, we, we write grants for individuals seeking out these treatments.

5136
04:21:47.96 --> 04:21:52.72
So we talked to a lot of vetted retreats and some, some have actually questioned like,

5137
04:21:52.72 --> 04:21:56.44
well, wait a minute, it's a combat veteran.

5138
04:21:56.44 --> 04:21:59.36
We're not, we're not so sure that we want to take that person because, you know, they

5139
04:21:59.36 --> 04:22:02.80
got PTSD and we're not sure if they're going to flip out.

5140
04:22:02.80 --> 04:22:07.000
And so, you know, we're, we're dealing with individuals are like, you know, worse to the

5141
04:22:07.000 --> 04:22:12.16
worst in terms of, in terms of like trauma and, and some other things.

5142
04:22:12.16 --> 04:22:14.80
And a lot of these other places are just used to dealing with some people are coming in

5143
04:22:14.80 --> 04:22:18.88
with, I got some depression or, I mean, I have a little anxiety I want to deal with.

5144
04:22:18.88 --> 04:22:26.56
So this should be definitely looked at and approached carefully.

5145
04:22:26.56 --> 04:22:30.76
I got asked a question the other day about basically the guy was like, Hey, you know,

5146
04:22:30.76 --> 04:22:35.52
I'm hanging out with these friends and they're drinking a lot and I'm not really drinking

5147
04:22:35.52 --> 04:22:38.72
and they're smoking pot and you know, I'm not really smoking pot or when I do, I kind

5148
04:22:38.72 --> 04:22:40.76
of like waste the weekend or waste the night.

5149
04:22:40.76 --> 04:22:43.04
Like, what do you think?

5150
04:22:43.04 --> 04:22:46.96
You know, how can I drink less and, you know, is it cool to drink sometimes and blah, blah,

5151
04:22:46.96 --> 04:22:47.96
blah, blah, right?

5152
04:22:47.96 --> 04:22:53.52
And I started kind of answering the question and I was, I just sort of said, I have seen

5153
04:22:53.52 --> 04:23:00.20
enough people's lives ruined from drugs and alcohol that I actually at this juncture in

5154
04:23:00.20 --> 04:23:04.24
my life, I can't even say like, Hey, dude, it's okay, you know, have a, I just can't

5155
04:23:04.24 --> 04:23:05.24
do it.

5156
04:23:05.24 --> 04:23:06.24
I can't do it anymore.

5157
04:23:06.24 --> 04:23:10.44
I just, I've seen too many people's lives destroyed from drugs and alcohol.

5158
04:23:10.44 --> 04:23:16.32
And so when, when I talk about this stuff, it's coming from someone that like is as far,

5159
04:23:16.32 --> 04:23:17.64
I don't think I could be anymore.

5160
04:23:17.64 --> 04:23:19.96
Well, I guess I could be a little bit more.

5161
04:23:19.96 --> 04:23:23.84
I just think that drugs and alcohol are so bad for you and I've seen them ruin so many

5162
04:23:23.84 --> 04:23:24.84
people's lives.

5163
04:23:24.84 --> 04:23:25.84
I've seen them ruin freaking tea.

5164
04:23:25.84 --> 04:23:31.32
How many team guys have you seen just like trash their lives with just alcohol?

5165
04:23:31.32 --> 04:23:32.32
Can't count.

5166
04:23:32.32 --> 04:23:33.60
It's, it's, it's ridiculous.

5167
04:23:33.60 --> 04:23:36.44
And so I can't get behind it at all.

5168
04:23:36.44 --> 04:23:43.32
And, and yet at the same time, I've had plenty of friends that have gone, they've done this.

5169
04:23:43.32 --> 04:23:48.32
And what I like about what you guys are talking about, it's a hardcore screening.

5170
04:23:48.32 --> 04:23:50.44
It's not like, Oh, you feel a little bad.

5171
04:23:50.44 --> 04:23:52.20
Okay, let's just jump right into this.

5172
04:23:52.20 --> 04:23:58.20
It's like, Hey, let's try some other protocols along the way and make sure that this is what

5173
04:23:58.20 --> 04:23:59.88
you really need.

5174
04:23:59.88 --> 04:24:02.36
And then I don't know if I want to use the term last resort, because I don't know if

5175
04:24:02.36 --> 04:24:04.80
you consider it, guys consider it a last resort.

5176
04:24:04.80 --> 04:24:08.92
But to me, it's like, Okay, I've tried this, I've tried that, I've tried something else.

5177
04:24:08.92 --> 04:24:14.20
It's been too much time and I'm at a rock bottom and I need help.

5178
04:24:14.20 --> 04:24:17.56
And this seems like, Okay, I need to get in there.

5179
04:24:17.56 --> 04:24:22.76
Um, yeah, because, because from my perspective of seeing drugs and alcohol ruin so many people's

5180
04:24:22.76 --> 04:24:25.48
lives that I just, I just can't get behind it.

5181
04:24:25.48 --> 04:24:30.32
But you know, here you have something that people aren't getting like addicted to it.

5182
04:24:30.32 --> 04:24:35.76
It's not, you know, it's not like the seven or whatever you said, nine freaking prescription

5183
04:24:35.76 --> 04:24:36.76
prescription drugs.

5184
04:24:36.76 --> 04:24:37.76
Hearing addictions.

5185
04:24:37.76 --> 04:24:38.76
Yeah.

5186
04:24:38.76 --> 04:24:45.16
Um, so appreciate, appreciate that side of it and not just throwing this at people just

5187
04:24:45.16 --> 04:24:49.000
like, you know, no one should be thrown into situations like this.

5188
04:24:49.000 --> 04:24:53.32
Um, you got to go through the proper screening and, and then go in the proper facility.

5189
04:24:53.32 --> 04:24:59.000
Uh, you know, you guys are talking about like, you know, Fred the shaman from Wisconsin

5190
04:24:59.000 --> 04:25:03.32
or whatever, you know, whatever this, like just going into random places and doing it

5191
04:25:03.32 --> 04:25:04.76
or at a Slayer concert.

5192
04:25:04.76 --> 04:25:06.72
It's not what we're talking about at all.

5193
04:25:06.72 --> 04:25:10.04
Um, and like I said, it seems to have helped.

5194
04:25:10.04 --> 04:25:11.04
I know it's helped.

5195
04:25:11.04 --> 04:25:12.04
I know it's helped.

5196
04:25:12.04 --> 04:25:16.16
I mean, obviously I'm sitting here in front of you and it helped you get back from the

5197
04:25:16.16 --> 04:25:18.64
brink and I've got plenty of other friends have done the same thing.

5198
04:25:18.64 --> 04:25:23.84
So, um, awesome to see this kind of progress.

5199
04:25:23.84 --> 04:25:24.84
Probably a good place to wrap it up.

5200
04:25:24.84 --> 04:25:25.84
Amber, you got anything else?

5201
04:25:25.84 --> 04:25:29.04
No, I would just say, um, thank you for having us.

5202
04:25:29.04 --> 04:25:30.56
Thank you for having an open mind.

5203
04:25:30.56 --> 04:25:34.56
I know it's, you know, it's very nerve-wracking to public.

5204
04:25:34.56 --> 04:25:35.56
I'm scared of it.

5205
04:25:35.56 --> 04:25:37.28
By the way, I'm sorry for, I'm scared.

5206
04:25:37.28 --> 04:25:39.48
Like I, I don't want to do anything to my brain.

5207
04:25:39.48 --> 04:25:41.000
I don't want to like, I'm scared of it.

5208
04:25:41.000 --> 04:25:46.48
I'm scared of, uh, maybe it's like that weird like control thing where I don't want to,

5209
04:25:46.48 --> 04:25:48.12
but like I'm scared.

5210
04:25:48.12 --> 04:25:50.12
What I'm scared of is like, I don't want to mess anything up.

5211
04:25:50.12 --> 04:25:53.92
I don't want to, I don't want to like, I feel, I feel like of a better word, bro.

5212
04:25:53.92 --> 04:25:54.92
I feel fine.

5213
04:25:54.92 --> 04:25:55.92
You know, so I feel fine.

5214
04:25:55.92 --> 04:26:00.60
So I'm always like, oh man, I don't want to do that because it makes me scared, uh,

5215
04:26:00.60 --> 04:26:02.08
to mess something up.

5216
04:26:02.08 --> 04:26:05.28
But that's cause I feel pretty, I feel pretty good right now.

5217
04:26:05.28 --> 04:26:13.96
So I think that, um, my fear of it is a healthy fear and, uh, but I think that's good though.

5218
04:26:13.96 --> 04:26:19.20
Like I think when you approach, you know, anything with that could be risky, like you

5219
04:26:19.20 --> 04:26:22.60
should approach it with some fear or respect.

5220
04:26:22.60 --> 04:26:25.56
I guess you want to say, yeah, you know, I mean, it's like the first time when we were

5221
04:26:25.56 --> 04:26:29.16
playing with, you know, demo and some other stuff or you're like, ah, you know, I've been

5222
04:26:29.16 --> 04:26:32.16
throwing a hundred grenades, you know, or a thousand grenades, like nothing can happen.

5223
04:26:32.16 --> 04:26:36.72
But like actually something really can happen, but you approach it with respect and you take

5224
04:26:36.72 --> 04:26:40.96
care and you make sure you, you tape them correctly and you know, you, you know, you

5225
04:26:40.96 --> 04:26:45.48
don't pull the, you know, drop this, you know, drop the grenade, throw the spoon or whatever.

5226
04:26:45.48 --> 04:26:49.88
Um, you know, same, same thing with these medicines, you know, approach them with care,

5227
04:26:49.88 --> 04:26:54.96
only do if me, if you need to, if you feel fine and you're good, like, why?

5228
04:26:54.96 --> 04:26:58.16
Um, I've never done a psychedelic.

5229
04:26:58.16 --> 04:26:59.40
No, I haven't either.

5230
04:26:59.40 --> 04:27:00.40
No.

5231
04:27:00.40 --> 04:27:01.40
And I don't feel called to do it.

5232
04:27:01.40 --> 04:27:07.72
You know, whatever you know, you know, you know, and, um, I will say that I've seen it.

5233
04:27:07.72 --> 04:27:14.16
I've seen these medicines change the lives, like not just help, but literally change the

5234
04:27:14.16 --> 04:27:20.80
lives, be them, be of the difference between life and death for countless operators.

5235
04:27:20.80 --> 04:27:24.68
And, um, for a lot of spouses as well, and there's a lot of trauma to heal.

5236
04:27:24.68 --> 04:27:28.52
I used to catch more, because looking out the window with like this thousand yard stare,

5237
04:27:28.52 --> 04:27:31.72
and I would say, like, please help me understand what's going on in your head.

5238
04:27:31.72 --> 04:27:33.20
What are you thinking about right now?

5239
04:27:33.20 --> 04:27:36.60
And he would say, how much better off you would be without me here?

5240
04:27:36.60 --> 04:27:40.96
How much easier your, your life would be in the kids lives would be without me here.

5241
04:27:40.96 --> 04:27:45.80
And so I feel like anytime you walk up to that line, you have to have an open mind of

5242
04:27:45.80 --> 04:27:48.16
like whatever works.

5243
04:27:48.16 --> 04:27:58.36
I have totally changed the way I think about what I have been told is a drug versus a drug.

5244
04:27:58.36 --> 04:27:59.36
This is a plant.

5245
04:27:59.36 --> 04:28:01.68
Like my faith is so important to me.

5246
04:28:01.68 --> 04:28:04.56
And I feel like God has given us everything that we need on earth.

5247
04:28:04.56 --> 04:28:08.52
A lot of these medicines, most of them originate from plants.

5248
04:28:08.52 --> 04:28:11.64
So I had to really like check myself.

5249
04:28:11.64 --> 04:28:15.88
And I have thought that something made by man in a laboratory that's prescribed by a

5250
04:28:15.88 --> 04:28:21.72
doctor in a lab coat is what is the cure.

5251
04:28:21.72 --> 04:28:23.40
And a plant is a drug.

5252
04:28:23.40 --> 04:28:26.32
And I've almost like flip flopped that.

5253
04:28:26.32 --> 04:28:30.88
And I feel like so many of these answers are found in nature and found within us.

5254
04:28:30.88 --> 04:28:34.92
And so I've just seen replicated time after time again, you give someone this opportunity

5255
04:28:34.92 --> 04:28:40.08
with something that's God given and totally unadultered.

5256
04:28:40.08 --> 04:28:45.000
And you create this reset and connection and like, Oh, they're good.

5257
04:28:45.000 --> 04:28:49.44
They're good as opposed to like putting a bandaid after bandaid after bandaid.

5258
04:28:49.44 --> 04:28:52.16
The US government is big farmers, number one customer.

5259
04:28:52.16 --> 04:29:00.36
And so, you know, getting people off of that cycle, this carousel of pharmaceuticals is

5260
04:29:00.36 --> 04:29:03.32
just unintended byproduct of what we're doing.

5261
04:29:03.32 --> 04:29:08.56
But man, we are seeing guys and gals really start to live again.

5262
04:29:08.56 --> 04:29:09.56
Oh, yeah.

5263
04:29:09.56 --> 04:29:10.56
I didn't mention that, Jaco.

5264
04:29:10.56 --> 04:29:16.84
So I was on those, all those anti depressants and whatever through November 11, 2017, when

5265
04:29:16.84 --> 04:29:18.16
I went down for treatment.

5266
04:29:18.16 --> 04:29:23.76
I haven't touched a prescription since not anything.

5267
04:29:23.76 --> 04:29:26.32
So it's pretty remarkable.

5268
04:29:26.32 --> 04:29:28.68
And again, my story is like one of hundreds.

5269
04:29:28.68 --> 04:29:31.64
I'm not, you know, I'm not the only one, which is nice.

5270
04:29:31.64 --> 04:29:34.52
Good to get rid of all those nasties.

5271
04:29:34.52 --> 04:29:40.44
The only other thing that I want to add really quickly is another unintended byproduct of

5272
04:29:40.44 --> 04:29:46.60
our work is that we've seen this incredible reunification.

5273
04:29:46.60 --> 04:29:51.36
Just this is a topic that everyone can generally agree upon as veteran health care.

5274
04:29:51.36 --> 04:29:54.68
And so we're seeing both sides of the aisle like actually come together, actually want

5275
04:29:54.68 --> 04:29:59.56
to work together, actually like one another again.

5276
04:29:59.56 --> 04:30:05.000
And so I hope that that ripple out effect continues across our nation.

5277
04:30:05.000 --> 04:30:09.04
I feel like we need healing now more than ever.

5278
04:30:09.04 --> 04:30:12.32
And it's pretty surreal what's happening.

5279
04:30:12.32 --> 04:30:14.04
It's an honor.

5280
04:30:14.04 --> 04:30:16.92
Marcus, any closing thoughts?

5281
04:30:16.92 --> 04:30:23.68
No, just, you know, first off, thank you for having us on here.

5282
04:30:23.68 --> 04:30:28.08
I know this was a different topic for you.

5283
04:30:28.08 --> 04:30:34.000
And again, trust me, this was nothing I ever intended out to even think about getting involved

5284
04:30:34.000 --> 04:30:35.08
in.

5285
04:30:35.08 --> 04:30:39.44
But I just, I see the power in it.

5286
04:30:39.44 --> 04:30:48.32
You know, and to approach these medicines carefully, they're not to be used at the Slayer

5287
04:30:48.32 --> 04:30:49.32
concert.

5288
04:30:49.32 --> 04:30:51.88
I think the way we're going about it is the right way.

5289
04:30:51.88 --> 04:30:58.12
I think the way that these are going to be introduced to the public is going to be done

5290
04:30:58.12 --> 04:30:59.12
correctly.

5291
04:30:59.12 --> 04:31:03.16
I think it's going to be a really medically driven industry.

5292
04:31:03.16 --> 04:31:07.28
At least first, you know, if it goes other routes, you know, it's not what we're here,

5293
04:31:07.28 --> 04:31:08.64
what we're talking about.

5294
04:31:08.64 --> 04:31:15.28
And so I, you know, I want to just tell people that if they're interested, you know, and

5295
04:31:15.28 --> 04:31:20.96
they're searching, make sure they do their research, make sure to find vetted providers

5296
04:31:20.96 --> 04:31:24.56
that have been doing this for a long time that know what they're doing.

5297
04:31:24.56 --> 04:31:31.000
Make sure they have a coach, a therapist that understands how these medicines work.

5298
04:31:31.000 --> 04:31:33.44
And again, you know, it's why we built vets.

5299
04:31:33.44 --> 04:31:36.20
It's why I'm building TARM Mind.

5300
04:31:36.20 --> 04:31:39.80
Again, it's to provide access and affordability for people.

5301
04:31:39.80 --> 04:31:45.000
And so last thing, you know, I'll say is that there's hope.

5302
04:31:45.000 --> 04:31:49.56
So if you're, you know, if you're out there and you're thinking that there's nothing

5303
04:31:49.56 --> 04:31:53.32
ahead of you, there's no purpose, you know, why are you here?

5304
04:31:53.32 --> 04:31:58.12
I promise that that is a, that's a temporary thought.

5305
04:31:58.12 --> 04:32:00.48
And 100%, you can climb out of that.

5306
04:32:00.48 --> 04:32:05.04
And once you do, you'll see how cool life can be and to get back to your old self or

5307
04:32:05.04 --> 04:32:08.72
maybe invent a new better, better person.

5308
04:32:08.72 --> 04:32:10.28
We are living our best life.

5309
04:32:10.28 --> 04:32:11.28
We really are.

5310
04:32:11.28 --> 04:32:13.96
And it is such an incredible blessing.

5311
04:32:13.96 --> 04:32:20.92
I just have to pinch myself every day that this is actually happening.

5312
04:32:20.92 --> 04:32:25.08
Marcus always says I have to get in the final word, which is there's some accuracy to that.

5313
04:32:25.08 --> 04:32:26.08
Less word, less word.

5314
04:32:26.08 --> 04:32:30.84
When something else that I just thought of when you said that is that, you know, part

5315
04:32:30.84 --> 04:32:39.68
of what we're doing to reverse these stigmas, especially around asking for help is adopting

5316
04:32:39.68 --> 04:32:45.48
more of a mindset that really, really true strength is vulnerability.

5317
04:32:45.48 --> 04:32:52.28
I think that our society would say the opposite, but it takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable.

5318
04:32:52.28 --> 04:32:55.60
And we're seeing that day in and day out of that.

5319
04:32:55.60 --> 04:32:56.60
Yeah.

5320
04:32:56.60 --> 04:32:58.60
If someone, I'm going to get the last word in there.

5321
04:32:58.60 --> 04:33:02.32
Someone thinks we like coming up here and talking about like all this shit that's gone

5322
04:33:02.32 --> 04:33:11.72
on and think we enjoy this spotlight is fucking crazy because we don't at all, but we definitely

5323
04:33:11.72 --> 04:33:12.72
feel it's necessary.

5324
04:33:12.72 --> 04:33:14.48
So like now I don't even think it's about us.

5325
04:33:14.48 --> 04:33:17.48
I think it's just like this needs to be done.

5326
04:33:17.48 --> 04:33:20.56
Well, I mean, thank you.

5327
04:33:20.56 --> 04:33:23.08
Thank you for both of you stepping into the spotlight.

5328
04:33:23.08 --> 04:33:29.60
And I know it's a bright spotlight and I know it's a burning spotlight in many cases.

5329
04:33:29.60 --> 04:33:35.52
You know, when you talk about being at Chad's funeral and just knowing that you had to do

5330
04:33:35.52 --> 04:33:42.92
something and you had at least an answer for a lot of people.

5331
04:33:42.92 --> 04:33:47.52
So thank you so much for joining us.

5332
04:33:47.52 --> 04:33:49.52
Thanks for your service.

5333
04:33:49.52 --> 04:33:54.56
And yeah, Marcus, thanks for your service and the teams and for signing the dotted line

5334
04:33:54.56 --> 04:33:56.32
and risking life in limb.

5335
04:33:56.32 --> 04:33:58.72
And you know, Amber, I don't get the chance.

5336
04:33:58.72 --> 04:34:02.36
My wife has always said like she's my wife has zero percent chance of coming on this

5337
04:34:02.36 --> 04:34:03.36
podcast.

5338
04:34:03.36 --> 04:34:05.88
She doesn't like to talk to anybody.

5339
04:34:05.88 --> 04:34:12.68
But for you, for all the wives, for all the spouses that, you know, you didn't put your

5340
04:34:12.68 --> 04:34:18.56
name on that line, but you put your name on that dotted line and what the wives and spouses

5341
04:34:18.56 --> 04:34:26.84
and families and your kids, what they go through is so harsh.

5342
04:34:26.84 --> 04:34:31.76
And yet you you're there and you supported and you continue to support and now you're

5343
04:34:31.76 --> 04:34:34.72
supporting all the families out there and all the veterans.

5344
04:34:34.72 --> 04:34:38.48
So thanks for what you have done in the past.

5345
04:34:38.48 --> 04:34:46.88
Thanks for what you're continuing to do as you help veterans get out of the darkness

5346
04:34:46.88 --> 04:34:53.32
and move toward light and life.

5347
04:34:53.32 --> 04:34:54.32
Thanks for what you're doing.

5348
04:34:54.32 --> 04:34:55.32
Thank you.

5349
04:34:55.32 --> 04:34:56.32
Thanks, Chaco.

5350
04:34:56.32 --> 04:34:57.32
It's been awesome.

5351
04:34:57.32 --> 04:34:58.92
Thank you.

5352
04:34:58.92 --> 04:35:03.60
With that, Marcus and Amber have left the building.

5353
04:35:03.60 --> 04:35:15.16
So pretty dynamic story of change and a journey that they've been through for sure.

5354
04:35:15.16 --> 04:35:19.44
Would you you were sitting in the corner, you were so you were off camera on that one.

5355
04:35:19.44 --> 04:35:20.44
Echo Charles.

5356
04:35:20.44 --> 04:35:21.44
What do you think?

5357
04:35:21.44 --> 04:35:22.44
Good evening, Echo, by the way.

5358
04:35:22.44 --> 04:35:23.44
Good evening.

5359
04:35:23.44 --> 04:35:24.44
Very interesting.

5360
04:35:24.44 --> 04:35:25.44
It was funny.

5361
04:35:25.44 --> 04:35:28.84
Even from the beginning, I was relating a lot because like both our birthday, he's one

5362
04:35:28.84 --> 04:35:30.32
year older than me.

5363
04:35:30.32 --> 04:35:31.72
Both our birthdays in December.

5364
04:35:31.72 --> 04:35:39.60
So we entered college later or we were late, you know, and entered college, played football.

5365
04:35:39.60 --> 04:35:43.52
And even and how's this as far as the was it you know him.

5366
04:35:43.52 --> 04:35:47.20
He was saying about alcohol, right?

5367
04:35:47.20 --> 04:35:48.68
Like, oh, how's this going to affect me?

5368
04:35:48.68 --> 04:35:51.24
Like how can it, you know, you thought that way too.

5369
04:35:51.24 --> 04:35:52.24
Yeah, with alcohol.

5370
04:35:52.24 --> 04:35:55.28
I was like, I'd always asked my friends like, because I didn't start drinking till I was

5371
04:35:55.28 --> 04:35:56.92
like, 2021.

5372
04:35:56.92 --> 04:36:01.72
And so I would always ask like, hey, like, can you tell that you're drunk or can you

5373
04:36:01.72 --> 04:36:05.56
tell that you're buzzing or are you just buzzing then afterwards you remember, oh, I was buzzing

5374
04:36:05.56 --> 04:36:06.80
or, you know, can you tell?

5375
04:36:06.80 --> 04:36:08.56
Like, what does it feel like kind of a thing?

5376
04:36:08.56 --> 04:36:14.04
I remember relating very deeply with that small, tiny part.

5377
04:36:14.04 --> 04:36:20.08
Also you're the one who said Andy Stumpf might be one of the bigger wiseasses.

5378
04:36:20.08 --> 04:36:22.48
He's I'll go in or I could say he's the biggest.

5379
04:36:22.48 --> 04:36:23.88
Oh, that was one of the most.

5380
04:36:23.88 --> 04:36:24.88
That was one of the most.

5381
04:36:24.88 --> 04:36:27.36
He's the number one biggest wise out.

5382
04:36:27.36 --> 04:36:29.88
Yes, fully.

5383
04:36:29.88 --> 04:36:31.12
What up?

5384
04:36:31.12 --> 04:36:35.52
You were talking about you think your mind is more of a serious one.

5385
04:36:35.52 --> 04:36:38.68
So you know, you're you were saying your mind is like, you feel okay.

5386
04:36:38.68 --> 04:36:41.04
So like, you're kind of, would you say scared to take psychedelics?

5387
04:36:41.04 --> 04:36:43.04
What if it jams you up?

5388
04:36:43.04 --> 04:36:44.04
Right?

5389
04:36:44.04 --> 04:36:48.44
Like, what if he did take it and it like made you, because you know how like some people

5390
04:36:48.44 --> 04:36:52.68
they're so driven, but because of like something that's kind of off in their mind, I feel like

5391
04:36:52.68 --> 04:36:54.68
that's kind of you in real life.

5392
04:36:54.68 --> 04:37:00.92
Yeah, like there's something probably significantly like off with you, but it's sort of like just

5393
04:37:00.92 --> 04:37:05.08
by happenstance like works for you, you know, some people are like that.

5394
04:37:05.08 --> 04:37:09.04
So what if you took psychedelics and then like now you're like, you kind of you're kind

5395
04:37:09.04 --> 04:37:12.000
of like more lazy or like you don't work as hard anymore.

5396
04:37:12.000 --> 04:37:14.20
I don't like that idea.

5397
04:37:14.20 --> 04:37:17.40
So I've even had people say like, oh, you know, you should, hey man, you know, you should

5398
04:37:17.40 --> 04:37:19.16
smoke pot.

5399
04:37:19.16 --> 04:37:22.44
And I'd be like, well, why be like, oh, because it kind of take your edge off.

5400
04:37:22.44 --> 04:37:25.20
And I was like, why would I want to take my edge off?

5401
04:37:25.20 --> 04:37:27.20
I want to sharpen it.

5402
04:37:27.20 --> 04:37:29.32
I want to be.

5403
04:37:29.32 --> 04:37:34.12
You're going to start sending like, like Christmas cards now and giving gifts.

5404
04:37:34.12 --> 04:37:35.96
Like, you know, like you need to do all that kind of stuff.

5405
04:37:35.96 --> 04:37:36.96
That's what I think.

5406
04:37:36.96 --> 04:37:41.76
I think you're going to be like, man, I've been, I've neglected the emotional elements

5407
04:37:41.76 --> 04:37:44.12
of friendships of my life for so long.

5408
04:37:44.12 --> 04:37:46.12
You're going to get the Christmas card.

5409
04:37:46.12 --> 04:37:47.12
I sent you.

5410
04:37:47.12 --> 04:37:49.40
Yeah, that's what I think would happen to you.

5411
04:37:49.40 --> 04:37:50.40
That's what I think.

5412
04:37:50.40 --> 04:37:53.48
Or you're going to like start really valuing your rest days.

5413
04:37:53.48 --> 04:37:57.72
You know, you're going to start scheduling like two solid rest days.

5414
04:37:57.72 --> 04:38:01.24
You're going to start exercising moderation in a bunch of things because it's better

5415
04:38:01.24 --> 04:38:02.64
for you like all this stuff.

5416
04:38:02.64 --> 04:38:03.88
It's going to change fundamentally.

5417
04:38:03.88 --> 04:38:07.64
I wouldn't count on anything that you're saying, but to the serious point of what you're

5418
04:38:07.64 --> 04:38:11.92
saying, like it does.

5419
04:38:11.92 --> 04:38:16.48
That kind of makes the like even just where our joking is like a legitimate concern.

5420
04:38:16.48 --> 04:38:18.36
I wouldn't want that.

5421
04:38:18.36 --> 04:38:24.24
I wouldn't want to be like quote more mellow.

5422
04:38:24.24 --> 04:38:27.32
And the other thing is you got to remember is we, you know, we do.

5423
04:38:27.32 --> 04:38:33.48
I mean, it's not like I'm walking around freaking, you know, like I go home, play guitar or

5424
04:38:33.48 --> 04:38:34.48
whatever, watch the sunset.

5425
04:38:34.48 --> 04:38:35.48
It's not, you know what I mean?

5426
04:38:35.48 --> 04:38:36.48
Like that's normal stuff.

5427
04:38:36.48 --> 04:38:37.48
Yeah.

5428
04:38:37.48 --> 04:38:38.48
Fully.

5429
04:38:38.48 --> 04:38:39.48
What was it?

5430
04:38:39.48 --> 04:38:41.48
You watched Robocop too.

5431
04:38:41.48 --> 04:38:42.48
Not sure.

5432
04:38:42.48 --> 04:38:43.48
So Robocop too.

5433
04:38:43.48 --> 04:38:45.04
He's so, you know, Robocop, he's kind of like you.

5434
04:38:45.04 --> 04:38:46.04
He's hardcore.

5435
04:38:46.04 --> 04:38:47.04
It just goes hard.

5436
04:38:47.04 --> 04:38:50.52
Drop your weapons or there will be trouble.

5437
04:38:50.52 --> 04:38:51.52
Yes.

5438
04:38:51.52 --> 04:38:52.52
Exactly.

5439
04:38:52.52 --> 04:38:57.28
So in part two, they're like, Hey, the Robocops for, you know, he does this, whatever he does.

5440
04:38:57.28 --> 04:39:01.28
And then they're like, Hey, he's getting like giving us a bad image.

5441
04:39:01.28 --> 04:39:04.36
I think like some other company came in or something like that.

5442
04:39:04.36 --> 04:39:08.56
And she was like, Hey, let's make them like more appealing, you know, more and more friendly

5443
04:39:08.56 --> 04:39:09.56
to the public and stuff.

5444
04:39:09.56 --> 04:39:12.08
And they write all these directives and like it jams him up.

5445
04:39:12.08 --> 04:39:13.72
That's gonna be you, bro.

5446
04:39:13.72 --> 04:39:14.72
Because they're right.

5447
04:39:14.72 --> 04:39:16.12
But in theory, they're right.

5448
04:39:16.12 --> 04:39:18.68
You know, how did it cause problems?

5449
04:39:18.68 --> 04:39:20.88
Like he wouldn't solve crimes anymore.

5450
04:39:20.88 --> 04:39:25.04
He'd start saying poems and stuff and like some dumb stuff that doesn't really match

5451
04:39:25.04 --> 04:39:26.04
his thing.

5452
04:39:26.04 --> 04:39:27.04
You know, it was like that.

5453
04:39:27.04 --> 04:39:28.28
You got to watch it to kind of see.

5454
04:39:28.28 --> 04:39:29.44
But anyway, that'd be you.

5455
04:39:29.44 --> 04:39:37.72
So yes, I am not down with messing with what I've got going on right now.

5456
04:39:37.72 --> 04:39:43.68
And so, but like I said, 10 times, I think I said it 48 times, but knowing a lot of guys

5457
04:39:43.68 --> 04:39:47.64
that have gone through this kind of thing and just talking to Marcus, man, you know,

5458
04:39:47.64 --> 04:39:52.20
when he's like, I said to him on the podcast, I'm like, dude, it's hard to even imagine

5459
04:39:52.20 --> 04:39:57.88
him getting like mad or, you know, throwing a coffee cup through a window or what, you

5460
04:39:57.88 --> 04:40:00.48
know, like this guy, he's, he's chill.

5461
04:40:00.48 --> 04:40:01.48
He's mellow.

5462
04:40:01.48 --> 04:40:02.76
He's and yet he's still doing great stuff.

5463
04:40:02.76 --> 04:40:04.000
He's not like he's not getting after it.

5464
04:40:04.000 --> 04:40:05.000
He's still in good shape.

5465
04:40:05.000 --> 04:40:07.96
You know, he's still, he's got businesses going to him.

5466
04:40:07.96 --> 04:40:11.52
He's 100% on, on, on track on a bunch of different levels.

5467
04:40:11.52 --> 04:40:14.60
So, you know, and this, this stuff really helped him out.

5468
04:40:14.60 --> 04:40:16.000
So I'm down.

5469
04:40:16.000 --> 04:40:20.16
I'm down for, if it helps people out for sure.

5470
04:40:20.16 --> 04:40:22.40
I do think it should be like a last resort scenario.

5471
04:40:22.40 --> 04:40:27.08
Look, not so close to the edge that the edge is a threat, but you know, try some other

5472
04:40:27.08 --> 04:40:30.000
things out, make sure you, you know, make sure your diet's clean.

5473
04:40:30.000 --> 04:40:34.84
Make sure you're not drinking every night and expecting things to be good in life.

5474
04:40:34.84 --> 04:40:37.32
If you're drinking every night, you can't expect things to be good in life.

5475
04:40:37.32 --> 04:40:38.32
Yeah.

5476
04:40:38.32 --> 04:40:41.16
I'm not saying you're going to have a bad life, but there's a chance you are.

5477
04:40:41.16 --> 04:40:45.36
So clean up the diet, get off the alcohol.

5478
04:40:45.36 --> 04:40:52.88
I can't give any advice about the, all the, all the prescription drugs, but you know,

5479
04:40:52.88 --> 04:40:54.80
maybe talk to your doctor about how you could get off.

5480
04:40:54.80 --> 04:40:56.96
So I don't know, man.

5481
04:40:56.96 --> 04:41:02.24
He was sitting downstairs and he made a really good point where, um, cause some people, they

5482
04:41:02.24 --> 04:41:07.40
like, you know how you say, and I get it cause it can seem like this, but some people are

5483
04:41:07.40 --> 04:41:09.92
most people with a problem with drinking.

5484
04:41:09.92 --> 04:41:11.16
They can't just stop drinking.

5485
04:41:11.16 --> 04:41:13.08
Like there's just, I'm not saying they can't.

5486
04:41:13.08 --> 04:41:15.92
I'm just saying there's a lot more to it than just, oh yeah, just stop drinking.

5487
04:41:15.92 --> 04:41:16.92
You know?

5488
04:41:16.92 --> 04:41:17.92
So for sure.

5489
04:41:17.92 --> 04:41:21.16
So he was like, we're downstairs talking right after, right after.

5490
04:41:21.16 --> 04:41:25.92
So he, he said, you can't tell someone who's in the basement.

5491
04:41:25.92 --> 04:41:28.48
He can't tell him, Hey, go on, just go exercise.

5492
04:41:28.48 --> 04:41:29.68
Oh, just go on the mat.

5493
04:41:29.68 --> 04:41:30.68
You know what?

5494
04:41:30.68 --> 04:41:33.72
That's kind of hard to do even for a normal person.

5495
04:41:33.72 --> 04:41:36.36
So you can't tell someone who's in the basement just to, just to do that.

5496
04:41:36.36 --> 04:41:37.36
Cause that's hard.

5497
04:41:37.36 --> 04:41:40.84
He's like, let's get them out of the basement first.

5498
04:41:40.84 --> 04:41:41.84
So he's safe.

5499
04:41:41.84 --> 04:41:42.84
They're out of the basement.

5500
04:41:42.84 --> 04:41:47.40
Then we can start introducing them to the mats, to more exercise, to all the, this other

5501
04:41:47.40 --> 04:41:50.66
stuff that's going to take more work by the way.

5502
04:41:50.66 --> 04:41:51.66
So you love Jiu Jitsu.

5503
04:41:51.66 --> 04:41:54.36
I'm sure working out has been a part of your life for a very long time.

5504
04:41:54.36 --> 04:41:55.36
So it's second nature.

5505
04:41:55.36 --> 04:42:00.64
You know, but for a lot of people, especially if they're not into working out, you're saying

5506
04:42:00.64 --> 04:42:04.56
you want them to work out for an hour a day.

5507
04:42:04.56 --> 04:42:06.48
Pretty much every day.

5508
04:42:06.48 --> 04:42:08.84
Like that, you know, working out freaking hard.

5509
04:42:08.84 --> 04:42:09.84
Yeah.

5510
04:42:09.84 --> 04:42:14.08
Well, the other key component of what you're saying is, I mean, if you remember, I, I like

5511
04:42:14.08 --> 04:42:18.72
tried to nail down Marcus a bunch of times about like, what did you feel?

5512
04:42:18.72 --> 04:42:25.24
And what he felt was not like not doing anything, like not motivated to do things.

5513
04:42:25.24 --> 04:42:32.48
So that, what you're talking about, the, the basement, like getting someone to like, I

5514
04:42:32.48 --> 04:42:34.08
think, oh, get him to work out.

5515
04:42:34.08 --> 04:42:35.08
What does that mean?

5516
04:42:35.08 --> 04:42:36.08
What does that mean?

5517
04:42:36.08 --> 04:42:37.08
She just get up and you work out.

5518
04:42:37.08 --> 04:42:38.76
Like to me, it's this normal thing.

5519
04:42:38.76 --> 04:42:40.84
But for a lot of people, that might be a big step.

5520
04:42:40.84 --> 04:42:43.60
Now, listen, it could be a smaller step if you put your mind to it, you know, it's going

5521
04:42:43.60 --> 04:42:45.36
to help you and maybe you get the rewards for it.

5522
04:42:45.36 --> 04:42:47.68
You commit to doing it for a certain amount of time.

5523
04:42:47.68 --> 04:42:49.92
It's like the, we were just talking to a kid in the locker room.

5524
04:42:49.92 --> 04:42:52.68
He goes, I just submitted someone for the first time in three years.

5525
04:42:52.68 --> 04:42:54.08
He's been training for three years.

5526
04:42:54.08 --> 04:42:56.44
Got his first submission, bro.

5527
04:42:56.44 --> 04:43:01.60
So remember that was one of the, one of the things I said when someone said, Hey, I really

5528
04:43:01.60 --> 04:43:02.60
don't like you.

5529
04:43:02.60 --> 04:43:03.60
Did you do how long should I train for?

5530
04:43:03.60 --> 04:43:08.16
And I was like, train until you submit to, train until you submit to someone.

5531
04:43:08.16 --> 04:43:14.32
Same thing with like working out, like workout until like there should be some thing that

5532
04:43:14.32 --> 04:43:15.32
you have to do.

5533
04:43:15.32 --> 04:43:16.32
Like, can you do a pull up?

5534
04:43:16.32 --> 04:43:19.88
If you can't do a pull up or workout until you can do a pull up.

5535
04:43:19.88 --> 04:43:28.28
If you can't, you know, run a mile in less than seven minutes, workout until you can

5536
04:43:28.28 --> 04:43:29.28
run a mile in less than seven minutes.

5537
04:43:29.28 --> 04:43:32.12
So I'm just saying, I don't, those aren't the correct answers, but I'm saying something

5538
04:43:32.12 --> 04:43:38.04
along those lines because there's no, if you're not feeling the short term reward, because

5539
04:43:38.04 --> 04:43:43.36
let's face it, you and me, we get a short term reward from working out just cause we

5540
04:43:43.36 --> 04:43:47.64
kind of know how it's going to feel later and we know the longterm health benefits.

5541
04:43:47.64 --> 04:43:54.52
So even a single workout feels good to me because I know the longterm benefits and I

5542
04:43:54.52 --> 04:43:57.64
know the, I know even the short term benefits.

5543
04:43:57.64 --> 04:43:59.72
So it feels good.

5544
04:43:59.72 --> 04:44:02.76
But if it doesn't feel good to someone and you don't know about the longterm rewards,

5545
04:44:02.76 --> 04:44:04.12
you don't see that strategic thing.

5546
04:44:04.12 --> 04:44:05.32
It just wasn't fun.

5547
04:44:05.32 --> 04:44:06.32
Yeah.

5548
04:44:06.32 --> 04:44:07.32
Just another thing they're going to avoid.

5549
04:44:07.32 --> 04:44:08.32
Yeah.

5550
04:44:08.32 --> 04:44:09.32
Just wasn't fun.

5551
04:44:09.32 --> 04:44:10.32
So yeah.

5552
04:44:10.32 --> 04:44:14.36
He said, he said, he mentioned something to brew briefly, but there's so much to it

5553
04:44:14.36 --> 04:44:19.44
where he said, I forget exactly the full context, but he said, get your heart rate up and it's

5554
04:44:19.44 --> 04:44:20.84
like better than most medicine.

5555
04:44:20.84 --> 04:44:21.84
Yeah.

5556
04:44:21.84 --> 04:44:22.84
He said something along those lines.

5557
04:44:22.84 --> 04:44:23.84
I'm like, man, that's true.

5558
04:44:23.84 --> 04:44:25.96
And I used to tell you about this.

5559
04:44:25.96 --> 04:44:29.40
Like remember when I was like kind of down for drinking every day or whatever?

5560
04:44:29.40 --> 04:44:31.16
It was like years ago.

5561
04:44:31.16 --> 04:44:36.08
And sometimes you enter in this funk, you know, and I was still working out and like

5562
04:44:36.08 --> 04:44:39.72
doing everything, but it's just a fun, you just have a funky day the next day, like

5563
04:44:39.72 --> 04:44:43.44
you're dragging and sometimes it would go all the way into your mind where I would have

5564
04:44:43.44 --> 04:44:48.24
these real low level mundane feelings of what kind of what he was talking about where it's

5565
04:44:48.24 --> 04:44:49.24
like, why bother?

5566
04:44:49.24 --> 04:44:51.64
Like, why do I even care about this?

5567
04:44:51.64 --> 04:44:52.64
What?

5568
04:44:52.64 --> 04:44:53.64
Jiu-Jitsu?

5569
04:44:53.64 --> 04:44:54.64
Like who cares?

5570
04:44:54.64 --> 04:44:55.64
Like what?

5571
04:44:55.64 --> 04:45:00.12
That's the path that I went down during that conversation of like when death, when you're

5572
04:45:00.12 --> 04:45:09.24
confronted with death and then the world moves on and you're like, well, we're all going

5573
04:45:09.24 --> 04:45:10.68
to end up in the same spot anyway.

5574
04:45:10.68 --> 04:45:13.64
So really kind of what's the point, right?

5575
04:45:13.64 --> 04:45:20.80
And I think that's the place where you could lose like lose the motivation to do really

5576
04:45:20.80 --> 04:45:25.24
anything because I'm thinking, dude, we're all going to end up in the grave anyways.

5577
04:45:25.24 --> 04:45:27.12
So whatever.

5578
04:45:27.12 --> 04:45:31.76
And that's a horrible place to be because you forget about all the things, all the beautiful

5579
04:45:31.76 --> 04:45:32.76
things that are in life.

5580
04:45:32.76 --> 04:45:35.80
I was listening to Jordan Peterson the other day.

5581
04:45:35.80 --> 04:45:41.88
You know, Jordan Peterson goes off on the like, you know, life is suffering and it's

5582
04:45:41.88 --> 04:45:46.36
going to be a nightmare and it's a misery and like, which I get.

5583
04:45:46.36 --> 04:45:49.92
And you know, it's even, it's not just him saying it's like religion is like all the

5584
04:45:49.92 --> 04:45:55.04
religions are like life is suffering and the Buddha is like, oh, it's suffering and I

5585
04:45:55.04 --> 04:45:56.04
get it.

5586
04:45:56.04 --> 04:45:58.16
I get it.

5587
04:45:58.16 --> 04:46:03.64
But man, there's a lot of things in life that are really kind of fun and cool.

5588
04:46:03.64 --> 04:46:11.08
And look, you're going to have, I think the point of Jordan Peterson is you look, you're

5589
04:46:11.08 --> 04:46:13.16
going to have suffering, right?

5590
04:46:13.16 --> 04:46:14.68
You're going to have suffering.

5591
04:46:14.68 --> 04:46:16.52
That's what's going to happen at some point, right?

5592
04:46:16.52 --> 04:46:17.52
People are going to get sick.

5593
04:46:17.52 --> 04:46:18.52
People are going to die.

5594
04:46:18.52 --> 04:46:19.52
Things are going to go right.

5595
04:46:19.52 --> 04:46:20.52
You're going to get fired.

5596
04:46:20.52 --> 04:46:21.52
You're going to, your business is going to fail.

5597
04:46:21.52 --> 04:46:22.72
Like all those things are going to happen, right?

5598
04:46:22.72 --> 04:46:30.36
So, but to just blanket say because of that life is I'm going to, I'm not just going to

5599
04:46:30.36 --> 04:46:35.08
go into Jordan and Peter and I'm going against a Buddha who they say life is suffering.

5600
04:46:35.08 --> 04:46:36.40
I'm going to say, you know what?

5601
04:46:36.40 --> 04:46:38.60
There's suffering in life, but life is not suffering.

5602
04:46:38.60 --> 04:46:40.60
There's a lot of cool stuff that happens.

5603
04:46:40.60 --> 04:46:42.28
There's a lot of funny stuff that happens.

5604
04:46:42.28 --> 04:46:43.64
You make friends.

5605
04:46:43.64 --> 04:46:44.64
You say some funny stuff.

5606
04:46:44.64 --> 04:46:45.64
Y'all laugh.

5607
04:46:45.64 --> 04:46:49.68
You've been sitting around laughing so hard that it's just, you can't even, it like hurts

5608
04:46:49.68 --> 04:46:50.68
your stomach.

5609
04:46:50.68 --> 04:46:51.68
Have you ever had that happen?

5610
04:46:51.68 --> 04:46:52.68
Yes, sir.

5611
04:46:52.68 --> 04:46:53.68
It's real.

5612
04:46:53.68 --> 04:46:54.68
Come on, man.

5613
04:46:54.68 --> 04:46:55.68
Is that suffering now?

5614
04:46:55.68 --> 04:46:56.68
No.

5615
04:46:56.68 --> 04:46:57.68
No, it's not.

5616
04:46:57.68 --> 04:46:59.44
So let's not take it to the extreme of life is suffering.

5617
04:46:59.44 --> 04:47:03.80
There's suffering in life and I get that and we're 100% agreement on that.

5618
04:47:03.80 --> 04:47:04.80
Who was it?

5619
04:47:04.80 --> 04:47:13.44
I think Hemingway said, I think Hemingway said, if two people love each other, there

5620
04:47:13.44 --> 04:47:19.000
can be no happy ending, which is true, right?

5621
04:47:19.000 --> 04:47:20.000
You know what I'm saying?

5622
04:47:20.000 --> 04:47:21.24
I mean, because someone's going to die.

5623
04:47:21.24 --> 04:47:22.24
Someone's going to die.

5624
04:47:22.24 --> 04:47:25.04
And at some point that other person's going to be sitting there crying because they lost

5625
04:47:25.04 --> 04:47:26.04
that person.

5626
04:47:26.04 --> 04:47:27.04
Yeah.

5627
04:47:27.04 --> 04:47:29.72
But that being said, live a happy life.

5628
04:47:29.72 --> 04:47:31.48
You take care of each other, whatever.

5629
04:47:31.48 --> 04:47:33.48
You have family.

5630
04:47:33.48 --> 04:47:36.48
You have grandchildren.

5631
04:47:36.48 --> 04:47:40.56
Hey, maybe that is a little bit of a happy ending.

5632
04:47:40.56 --> 04:47:41.56
You know what I'm saying?

5633
04:47:41.56 --> 04:47:42.56
Yeah.

5634
04:47:42.56 --> 04:47:43.56
So I don't know.

5635
04:47:43.56 --> 04:47:45.72
I think we're leaning a little bit far into suffering right now.

5636
04:47:45.72 --> 04:47:47.24
And look, I get it.

5637
04:47:47.24 --> 04:47:51.36
I get it, man.

5638
04:47:51.36 --> 04:47:53.92
Your heart is going to get broken.

5639
04:47:53.92 --> 04:47:56.04
And I'm not just talking about, oh, I'm in a relationship.

5640
04:47:56.04 --> 04:47:57.48
I'm talking your friends die.

5641
04:47:57.48 --> 04:47:59.000
Your heart's going to be broken.

5642
04:47:59.000 --> 04:48:02.12
It's going to hurt.

5643
04:48:02.12 --> 04:48:05.16
But that's not everything.

5644
04:48:05.16 --> 04:48:11.52
So and I think, you know, from what, from what Marcus is saying, you know, some of that

5645
04:48:11.52 --> 04:48:19.24
visibility of the good stuff comes by dealing with that other stuff.

5646
04:48:19.24 --> 04:48:23.88
And that's another thing for me.

5647
04:48:23.88 --> 04:48:26.80
And I talk about this in discipline, freedom, field manual a little bit.

5648
04:48:26.80 --> 04:48:34.28
But I think, you know, I've lost friends and I've talked about it.

5649
04:48:34.28 --> 04:48:40.60
And straight up giving eulogies for my guys.

5650
04:48:40.60 --> 04:48:46.28
Like immediately as soon as they die, you're basically like writing about what you thought

5651
04:48:46.28 --> 04:48:49.000
about them and how you felt about them and what they meant to you and how awesome they

5652
04:48:49.000 --> 04:48:50.000
were.

5653
04:48:50.000 --> 04:48:52.04
Like that is so therapeutic.

5654
04:48:52.04 --> 04:48:57.60
Even though I was doing it as my duty, it also I recognize that it was a therapeutic thing.

5655
04:48:57.60 --> 04:49:00.40
I recognize later in life that, oh, like how did I get through that?

5656
04:49:00.40 --> 04:49:01.48
Oh, yeah, I wrote about them.

5657
04:49:01.48 --> 04:49:03.56
And when you write about them, you detach from it.

5658
04:49:03.56 --> 04:49:06.32
When you detach from it, you get to read and you get to think and you get to think through

5659
04:49:06.32 --> 04:49:07.32
it and you get to process.

5660
04:49:07.32 --> 04:49:13.36
And all those things happen by writing about, you know, your friend, your hero, this person,

5661
04:49:13.36 --> 04:49:15.28
this individual that made this sacrifice.

5662
04:49:15.28 --> 04:49:22.24
And it's a way of processing this stuff that I think, you know, the term that Marcus used

5663
04:49:22.24 --> 04:49:28.28
was, you know, you got to, the only way to get, to get over this stuff is to go through

5664
04:49:28.28 --> 04:49:29.28
it.

5665
04:49:29.28 --> 04:49:30.28
Right.

5666
04:49:30.28 --> 04:49:33.60
And that's sort of like you do when you write a eulogy or you write a letter to someone that's

5667
04:49:33.60 --> 04:49:39.40
passed or you talk to their parents about them, you talk to their, their siblings about

5668
04:49:39.40 --> 04:49:40.40
them.

5669
04:49:40.40 --> 04:49:47.80
And that is so, such a good way to help move through the pain that you're going to feel.

5670
04:49:47.80 --> 04:49:48.80
And you're going to feel pain.

5671
04:49:48.80 --> 04:49:53.20
You're going to suffer, but life is not suffering.

5672
04:49:53.20 --> 04:49:57.72
There's much more to it and a lot of it's good.

5673
04:49:57.72 --> 04:50:04.12
So yeah, I heard that everyone that I know that went through psychedelic journey, all

5674
04:50:04.12 --> 04:50:07.96
the way, even like some people, some people I do, isn't the official one.

5675
04:50:07.96 --> 04:50:11.32
It just takes some mushrooms, but they do it with intention.

5676
04:50:11.32 --> 04:50:12.60
It's all worked for them.

5677
04:50:12.60 --> 04:50:15.68
Like I know people who quit drinking.

5678
04:50:15.68 --> 04:50:20.24
It's weird, but the, the two people I know who quit drinking was real surprising too,

5679
04:50:20.24 --> 04:50:25.04
but slowly by slowly like it came back and then they started drinking again, not just

5680
04:50:25.04 --> 04:50:26.96
all of a sudden they didn't just be like, okay, that was fine.

5681
04:50:26.96 --> 04:50:27.96
And now I'm drinking again.

5682
04:50:27.96 --> 04:50:32.48
It would be like, you know, six months later, they'll be like, I'll just have one.

5683
04:50:32.48 --> 04:50:36.12
And then it just slowly creeps back in, which actually went in line with what he was saying,

5684
04:50:36.12 --> 04:50:38.24
or it's like, Hey, it's not just a magic pill one time.

5685
04:50:38.24 --> 04:50:42.56
It's kind of like, it's kind of like a, it's like a therapy almost kind of a thing.

5686
04:50:42.56 --> 04:50:47.52
Cause it's like, I guess it like rewires your, the way I always saw it was like all year,

5687
04:50:47.52 --> 04:50:50.40
the way you regard it, the way you create meaning or whatever it has to do with like

5688
04:50:50.40 --> 04:50:54.04
all your past experiences mixed with how you're, you know, you're genetics or whatever.

5689
04:50:54.04 --> 04:50:59.20
So all your past experiences, ups down trauma, no trauma is like everything kind of creates

5690
04:50:59.20 --> 04:51:03.04
little meanings with every little interaction.

5691
04:51:03.04 --> 04:51:08.48
So if those meanings that you created in your head are all jammed up, or even if they're,

5692
04:51:08.48 --> 04:51:11.96
I don't know, maybe they're, everyone's going to have different meanings for different things.

5693
04:51:11.96 --> 04:51:17.16
So what it does is it goes back to those original like meanings that you're making and it just

5694
04:51:17.16 --> 04:51:23.32
jumbles them all up and kind of, so you can kind of detach from the way they were formed.

5695
04:51:23.32 --> 04:51:27.68
So it kind of like, oh, so you can make your, and he made a good analogy with the snow.

5696
04:51:27.68 --> 04:51:29.72
So it's like, you can make your own tracks, be careful though.

5697
04:51:29.72 --> 04:51:31.16
But yeah, the tracks you make could be wrong.

5698
04:51:31.16 --> 04:51:35.000
Oh yeah, because, and because some people, they'll just take it recreationally and they'll

5699
04:51:35.000 --> 04:51:38.000
be like, oh yeah, it was just a trip and it opened my eyes, but they don't really get

5700
04:51:38.000 --> 04:51:39.96
any intended like positive outcome.

5701
04:51:39.96 --> 04:51:44.72
They just, oh, I just want to, as my little brother's wife said, some people just want

5702
04:51:44.72 --> 04:51:46.12
to take mushrooms to fry.

5703
04:51:46.12 --> 04:51:49.44
And they'll recommend this.

5704
04:51:49.44 --> 04:51:55.40
No, no, one time Jade was getting all deep in the, you know, one night and he's like,

5705
04:51:55.40 --> 04:51:57.48
yeah, you know, he's taking mushrooms and do all this stuff.

5706
04:51:57.48 --> 04:51:59.96
And she's like, why you got to try to be all intellectual about it?

5707
04:51:59.96 --> 04:52:03.08
Why can't you just admit some people just take mushrooms to fry?

5708
04:52:03.08 --> 04:52:08.08
But yeah, that's a different thing.

5709
04:52:08.08 --> 04:52:09.84
I'm saying, yeah.

5710
04:52:09.84 --> 04:52:10.84
All right.

5711
04:52:10.84 --> 04:52:18.72
Well, if you want to support this podcast, get some jocofuel, get some jocofuel.

5712
04:52:18.72 --> 04:52:19.72
Pink mist.

5713
04:52:19.72 --> 04:52:20.72
Have you had pink mist yet?

5714
04:52:20.72 --> 04:52:21.72
I have.

5715
04:52:21.72 --> 04:52:22.72
How do you like it?

5716
04:52:22.72 --> 04:52:23.72
It's good.

5717
04:52:23.72 --> 04:52:24.72
Pink lemony.

5718
04:52:24.72 --> 04:52:25.72
But it's not your thing.

5719
04:52:25.72 --> 04:52:26.72
It's not your jam.

5720
04:52:26.72 --> 04:52:27.72
It's my jam.

5721
04:52:27.72 --> 04:52:28.72
Just like oranges, my jam.

5722
04:52:28.72 --> 04:52:29.72
So it's like good.

5723
04:52:29.72 --> 04:52:30.72
I guess I taste it.

5724
04:52:30.72 --> 04:52:31.72
Pink lemonade.

5725
04:52:31.72 --> 04:52:32.72
Oh yeah, good.

5726
04:52:32.72 --> 04:52:33.72
But we already knew that kind of a thing.

5727
04:52:33.72 --> 04:52:36.72
It's not like mango or I'm like, oh, this is freaking mango.

5728
04:52:36.72 --> 04:52:37.72
Let's see.

5729
04:52:37.72 --> 04:52:41.80
Look, if you go, you have a fruit bowl and you might be different, but this is just me.

5730
04:52:41.80 --> 04:52:44.48
I got a grapefruit.

5731
04:52:44.48 --> 04:52:45.48
I got orange.

5732
04:52:45.48 --> 04:52:46.48
Yep.

5733
04:52:46.48 --> 04:52:47.48
And I got a mango.

5734
04:52:47.48 --> 04:52:48.48
You're going mango, huh?

5735
04:52:48.48 --> 04:52:50.28
I will eat the orange and I'll be like, cool.

5736
04:52:50.28 --> 04:52:53.32
I'll have a grapefruit or pink lemonade or whatever, or lemon, whatever.

5737
04:52:53.32 --> 04:52:54.32
Good.

5738
04:52:54.32 --> 04:52:55.32
Fine.

5739
04:52:55.32 --> 04:52:56.32
But bro, come on.

5740
04:52:56.32 --> 04:52:57.32
A mango.

5741
04:52:57.32 --> 04:52:58.32
Mangoes just taste better to me.

5742
04:52:58.32 --> 04:52:59.32
Okay.

5743
04:52:59.32 --> 04:53:00.32
Mango juice.

5744
04:53:00.32 --> 04:53:01.32
All right.

5745
04:53:01.32 --> 04:53:02.32
So we got some drinks, discipline go.

5746
04:53:02.32 --> 04:53:03.32
We can get mango.

5747
04:53:03.32 --> 04:53:09.60
I'll tell you what, the new tactical tea, which is like iced tea, lemonade.

5748
04:53:09.60 --> 04:53:13.92
A lot of people, and you know what I mean by a lot of people, a lot of people are saying

5749
04:53:13.92 --> 04:53:15.48
that that might be the one.

5750
04:53:15.48 --> 04:53:18.16
You also got the new Dax avage, which is ridiculous.

5751
04:53:18.16 --> 04:53:19.32
So basically everybody.

5752
04:53:19.32 --> 04:53:26.04
So like, okay, so a wise man named Kate Knuts once said, he's all, everybody's showing up.

5753
04:53:26.04 --> 04:53:27.92
So in your case, everyone.

5754
04:53:27.92 --> 04:53:30.92
He's like, you, me, everybody.

5755
04:53:30.92 --> 04:53:31.92
Everybody.

5756
04:53:31.92 --> 04:53:32.92
Jockofuel.com.

5757
04:53:32.92 --> 04:53:35.76
Go get some of that stuff.

5758
04:53:35.76 --> 04:53:36.76
Get some more.

5759
04:53:36.76 --> 04:53:40.36
We got the ready to drink more, which is, I'm telling you what, I got problems with ready

5760
04:53:40.36 --> 04:53:43.84
to drink more because I'm drinking it way, it's way too easy.

5761
04:53:43.84 --> 04:53:44.84
Too easy.

5762
04:53:44.84 --> 04:53:45.84
It's too easy.

5763
04:53:45.84 --> 04:53:46.84
Like boom.

5764
04:53:46.84 --> 04:53:47.84
But you know what's nice?

5765
04:53:47.84 --> 04:53:52.92
It's just like a little 30 gram protein hitter, which is an unbelievably convenient and

5766
04:53:52.92 --> 04:53:54.32
joyous thing in life.

5767
04:53:54.32 --> 04:53:58.96
It's just to be like, you know what, and it tastes freaking good.

5768
04:53:58.96 --> 04:54:00.96
Pete's son Keegan, cause I don't like vanilla.

5769
04:54:00.96 --> 04:54:01.96
You know, I don't like vanilla.

5770
04:54:01.96 --> 04:54:02.96
Right.

5771
04:54:02.96 --> 04:54:03.96
It's not my jam.

5772
04:54:03.96 --> 04:54:06.16
It's real vanilla.

5773
04:54:06.16 --> 04:54:07.52
But so I was drinking banana.

5774
04:54:07.52 --> 04:54:11.12
I was drinking chocolate and that camp Pete's son Keegan.

5775
04:54:11.12 --> 04:54:14.52
He's like, it tastes like melted vanilla ice cream.

5776
04:54:14.52 --> 04:54:19.32
And I kind of didn't believe him cause let's face it, even people that don't like vanilla,

5777
04:54:19.32 --> 04:54:21.32
melted vanilla ice cream is hella good.

5778
04:54:21.32 --> 04:54:22.32
Right.

5779
04:54:22.32 --> 04:54:23.32
You know what I'm saying.

5780
04:54:23.32 --> 04:54:24.32
You're right.

5781
04:54:24.32 --> 04:54:25.32
It's 100% accurate.

5782
04:54:25.32 --> 04:54:26.32
You're correct.

5783
04:54:26.32 --> 04:54:27.32
100% accurate.

5784
04:54:27.32 --> 04:54:31.16
So I said to myself, there's no way this tastes like melted vanilla ice cream cause then

5785
04:54:31.16 --> 04:54:33.20
it would be hella good.

5786
04:54:33.20 --> 04:54:36.32
And sure enough, I cracked it open.

5787
04:54:36.32 --> 04:54:38.36
It tastes like melted vanilla ice cream.

5788
04:54:38.36 --> 04:54:39.36
It's legitimate.

5789
04:54:39.36 --> 04:54:40.36
Yes.

5790
04:54:40.36 --> 04:54:43.44
It is a legitimate, tasty treat.

5791
04:54:43.44 --> 04:54:45.56
So that's the ready to drink.

5792
04:54:45.56 --> 04:54:46.56
Check that out.

5793
04:54:46.56 --> 04:54:47.56
DracoFuel.com.

5794
04:54:47.56 --> 04:54:48.56
You can get it at Wawa.

5795
04:54:48.56 --> 04:54:50.12
You can get this stuff at the vitamin shop.

5796
04:54:50.12 --> 04:54:52.56
Vitamin shop's got pink mist in it right now.

5797
04:54:52.56 --> 04:54:53.56
Yeah.

5798
04:54:53.56 --> 04:54:54.56
There you go.

5799
04:54:54.56 --> 04:54:55.56
DracoFuel.com.

5800
04:54:55.56 --> 04:54:56.56
Get some of that.

5801
04:54:56.56 --> 04:54:58.72
Also originUSA.com if you need jeans.

5802
04:54:58.72 --> 04:55:00.04
Look, American made stuff.

5803
04:55:00.04 --> 04:55:01.56
This is the big thing.

5804
04:55:01.56 --> 04:55:02.56
All right.

5805
04:55:02.56 --> 04:55:09.12
Cause there's people all over the world that are enslaving children to make you a pair

5806
04:55:09.12 --> 04:55:11.64
of pants.

5807
04:55:11.64 --> 04:55:13.64
And you should not support that.

5808
04:55:13.64 --> 04:55:15.16
You should support America.

5809
04:55:15.16 --> 04:55:17.96
Which means you should support originUSA.com.

5810
04:55:17.96 --> 04:55:19.12
Get jeans.

5811
04:55:19.12 --> 04:55:20.32
Get boots.

5812
04:55:20.32 --> 04:55:22.52
Get hunting gear.

5813
04:55:22.52 --> 04:55:25.64
Get the hunt lines out.

5814
04:55:25.64 --> 04:55:26.92
Get what else do you need to get?

5815
04:55:26.92 --> 04:55:29.88
The new washes of the Delta 68 is out.

5816
04:55:29.88 --> 04:55:30.88
I'm getting the two year.

5817
04:55:30.88 --> 04:55:31.88
I'm going to get the two year.

5818
04:55:31.88 --> 04:55:32.88
I'm going to get the two year wash.

5819
04:55:32.88 --> 04:55:33.88
Yeah, that's the middle one.

5820
04:55:33.88 --> 04:55:34.88
The middle one.

5821
04:55:34.88 --> 04:55:35.88
I'm getting them all.

5822
04:55:35.88 --> 04:55:36.88
You're getting them all.

5823
04:55:36.88 --> 04:55:37.88
I freaking like them all.

5824
04:55:37.88 --> 04:55:42.40
The thing is about the light one is if it's sun out, that's going to be a lot cooler.

5825
04:55:42.40 --> 04:55:43.40
You know what I'm saying?

5826
04:55:43.40 --> 04:55:44.88
Cause it's sun dark or whatever.

5827
04:55:44.88 --> 04:55:46.40
Yeah, it is more summer vibes-ish.

5828
04:55:46.40 --> 04:55:47.40
Yeah.

5829
04:55:47.40 --> 04:55:48.40
That's a different look.

5830
04:55:48.40 --> 04:55:49.40
But I'm early.

5831
04:55:49.40 --> 04:55:50.40
OriginUSA.com.

5832
04:55:50.40 --> 04:55:52.40
Don't forget about geese as well.

5833
04:55:52.40 --> 04:55:57.56
Cause once you put on an origin gear, you literally will not wear another gear again.

5834
04:55:57.56 --> 04:56:01.56
Yeah, I literally, literally donated all my other geese.

5835
04:56:01.56 --> 04:56:02.56
Yeah.

5836
04:56:02.56 --> 04:56:03.56
Like just the other day.

5837
04:56:03.56 --> 04:56:04.56
Actually two weeks ago.

5838
04:56:04.56 --> 04:56:05.56
Yeah, for real.

5839
04:56:05.56 --> 04:56:06.56
They have no purpose in life.

5840
04:56:06.56 --> 04:56:07.56
No purpose.

5841
04:56:07.56 --> 04:56:12.12
Those old geese, we apologize to the receivers of these geese, but at least if they can

5842
04:56:12.12 --> 04:56:17.84
get them started, then they can become a world champion and get a good gear.

5843
04:56:17.84 --> 04:56:18.84
OriginUSA.com.

5844
04:56:18.84 --> 04:56:19.84
Get some of that.

5845
04:56:19.84 --> 04:56:20.84
It's true.

5846
04:56:20.84 --> 04:56:21.84
Also, Jockelstore.

5847
04:56:21.84 --> 04:56:25.56
I talked about it already, but a fish, I'm announcing it.

5848
04:56:25.56 --> 04:56:27.56
Send out email to everybody.

5849
04:56:27.56 --> 04:56:30.24
The standard issue, discipline equals freedom.

5850
04:56:30.24 --> 04:56:37.60
So it's the kind where if you don't have the standard issue, are you even really represented?

5851
04:56:37.60 --> 04:56:39.28
I know the answer is probably yes.

5852
04:56:39.28 --> 04:56:40.28
That's a big pressure scenario.

5853
04:56:40.28 --> 04:56:41.28
I know.

5854
04:56:41.28 --> 04:56:42.28
I know.

5855
04:56:42.28 --> 04:56:43.28
I know.

5856
04:56:43.28 --> 04:56:44.28
The answer is probably yes.

5857
04:56:44.28 --> 04:56:45.28
You sure you want to do it like that?

5858
04:56:45.28 --> 04:56:46.28
No.

5859
04:56:46.28 --> 04:56:47.28
I'm not sure I want to do it like that.

5860
04:56:47.28 --> 04:56:48.28
But-

5861
04:56:48.28 --> 04:56:51.28
What if a dude is just getting after in seven different fronts and you not got a standard

5862
04:56:51.28 --> 04:56:52.80
issue, you're like, hey, you're not really represented?

5863
04:56:52.80 --> 04:56:53.80
I know.

5864
04:56:53.80 --> 04:56:54.80
Do I even have to?

5865
04:56:54.80 --> 04:56:55.80
You're right.

5866
04:56:55.80 --> 04:56:56.80
You're right.

5867
04:56:56.80 --> 04:56:57.80
And look, hey, look, I'm still hypothesizing.

5868
04:56:57.80 --> 04:57:03.20
For judgmental people, you might not be representing.

5869
04:57:03.20 --> 04:57:04.20
Or just check it out.

5870
04:57:04.20 --> 04:57:05.72
I think that statement actually might piss some people off.

5871
04:57:05.72 --> 04:57:08.04
I kind of got a little bit pissed when you just said it.

5872
04:57:08.04 --> 04:57:09.04
Yeah.

5873
04:57:09.04 --> 04:57:11.72
That's why I was like, it's kind of like, you know, it's a working, it's a working,

5874
04:57:11.72 --> 04:57:12.72
what do you call it, slogan?

5875
04:57:12.72 --> 04:57:13.72
Yeah.

5876
04:57:13.72 --> 04:57:14.72
Okay.

5877
04:57:14.72 --> 04:57:15.72
So less pressure.

5878
04:57:15.72 --> 04:57:16.72
Either way, it's out.

5879
04:57:16.72 --> 04:57:17.72
It's good.

5880
04:57:17.72 --> 04:57:18.72
It's cool.

5881
04:57:18.72 --> 04:57:19.72
People have it.

5882
04:57:19.72 --> 04:57:25.84
It's good depending on your, your proclivity to support various units.

5883
04:57:25.84 --> 04:57:26.84
Yes.

5884
04:57:26.84 --> 04:57:28.84
Good way to put it.

5885
04:57:28.84 --> 04:57:31.56
There's a lot of good other cool stuff on there.

5886
04:57:31.56 --> 04:57:35.48
Also the short locker, new shirt every month, creative designs for like-

5887
04:57:35.48 --> 04:57:40.56
What was this for the last design was a toxic productivity?

5888
04:57:40.56 --> 04:57:41.56
Toxic productivity.

5889
04:57:41.56 --> 04:57:47.60
Oh, you got me on a surfboard with like a computer in one hand, book in another hand,

5890
04:57:47.60 --> 04:57:49.08
papers flying everywhere.

5891
04:57:49.08 --> 04:57:50.08
Discipline goes everywhere.

5892
04:57:50.08 --> 04:57:51.08
Discipline goes everywhere.

5893
04:57:51.08 --> 04:57:52.08
Discipline goes everywhere.

5894
04:57:52.08 --> 04:57:53.08
All right.

5895
04:57:53.08 --> 04:57:54.08
So, yep.

5896
04:57:54.08 --> 04:57:56.08
You can get the short locker at jockelstore.com.

5897
04:57:56.08 --> 04:58:00.16
Go to, if you want to subscribe to this podcast, do it, leave a review.

5898
04:58:00.16 --> 04:58:03.36
So Echo, if you want to leave that little review about Echo where you're like, maybe

5899
04:58:03.36 --> 04:58:05.16
he should just be quiet.

5900
04:58:05.16 --> 04:58:06.16
Yeah.

5901
04:58:06.16 --> 04:58:11.68
If you want to say that Echo's best podcast ever was today when he wasn't on it, then

5902
04:58:11.68 --> 04:58:13.000
you can leave that review on there.

5903
04:58:13.000 --> 04:58:14.52
We'll be happy about it.

5904
04:58:14.52 --> 04:58:15.88
Jockelunderground.com.

5905
04:58:15.88 --> 04:58:16.88
Go and support.

5906
04:58:16.88 --> 04:58:20.04
Look, we don't own this platform that you're listening to this on unless you're on the

5907
04:58:20.04 --> 04:58:21.04
underground.

5908
04:58:21.04 --> 04:58:22.84
If you're on the underground, guess what?

5909
04:58:22.84 --> 04:58:25.52
We will be there no matter what.

5910
04:58:25.52 --> 04:58:27.80
We're not going to get kicked off our own platform, right?

5911
04:58:27.80 --> 04:58:28.80
We made our own playground.

5912
04:58:28.80 --> 04:58:29.80
Remember that?

5913
04:58:29.80 --> 04:58:32.48
You know, you get kicked out of some club, make our own club.

5914
04:58:32.48 --> 04:58:34.56
We get kicked out of some jiu-jitsu schools.

5915
04:58:34.56 --> 04:58:36.04
Made our own jiu-jitsu school.

5916

We also have an online training academy, extremownership.com.

5935
04:59:08.28 --> 04:59:11.28
You can't just go to the gym one time and be in shape.

5936
04:59:11.28 --> 04:59:14.80
You can't just pick up a guitar and take one lesson and know how to play guitar.

5937
04:59:14.80 --> 04:59:17.16
You got to get in the game.

She also helps Vets.

5948
04:59:55.92 --> 05:00:00.44
She puts them through a bunch of protocols.

5949
05:00:00.44 --> 05:00:07.52
One of the primary protocols is the hyperbaric chamber, like 30 and 45 day protocols where

5950
05:00:07.52 --> 05:00:09.56
you're on clean food.

5951
05:00:09.56 --> 05:00:11.60

5953
05:00:14.52 --> 05:00:16.32
Everything is paid for.

That's what she's doing to help out.

5955
05:00:18.32 --> 05:00:21.80
One of the many things she does, but that's one of the things that she does.

5956
05:00:21.80 --> 05:00:27.40

Another little journey.

5959
05:00:30.40 --> 05:00:32.40
I guess we're not using the word trip.

5960
05:00:32.40 --> 05:00:33.40
Another journey that people can take.

5961
05:00:33.40 --> 05:00:35.84
You can take a journey in a hyperbaric chamber.

5962
05:00:35.84 --> 05:00:37.96

Those on horses.org, Micah Fink up there taking people in the wilderness where they're going

5964
05:00:43.000 --> 05:00:46.96
to find and confront themselves as well.

5965
05:00:46.96 --> 05:00:51.96

5968
05:01:06.92 --> 05:01:09.000

5969
05:01:09.000 --> 05:01:14.12
Be wary, be very wary of the algorithm.

5970
05:01:14.12 --> 05:01:18.000
Once again, thanks to Marcus Nambur for everything that you have done for the country, for the

5971
05:01:18.000 --> 05:01:22.56
teams and what you're doing now for the veteran community.

5972
05:01:22.56 --> 05:01:27.20
A special thanks today to all the families.

5973
05:01:27.20 --> 05:01:30.40
All the families out there, the husbands and the wives, the sons and the daughters, the

5974
05:01:30.40 --> 05:01:34.36
mothers, the fathers, the brothers and sisters.

5975
05:01:34.36 --> 05:01:39.88
Thanks to all you families that support our service men and women around the world.

5976
05:01:39.88 --> 05:01:46.92
And thank you for waiting and worrying and supporting them through all those sleepless

5977
05:01:46.92 --> 05:01:47.92
nights.

5978
05:01:47.92 --> 05:01:54.68
Your families make a huge sacrifice for our nation and we thank you for that.

5979
05:01:54.68 --> 05:01:59.88
And the same goes to the families of our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

5980
05:01:59.88 --> 05:02:04.32
EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders,

5981
05:02:04.32 --> 05:02:13.20
your families support what you provide as families to our first responders, allows them

5982
05:02:13.20 --> 05:02:17.64
to do their job so that we can live in safety.

5983
05:02:17.64 --> 05:02:27.32
And everyone else out there, look, life is hard and there is suffering and it can get

5984
05:02:27.32 --> 05:02:34.28
dark and sometimes it might seem like there's no way out and it might seem that you're alone.

5985
05:02:34.28 --> 05:02:36.52
But you're not alone.

5986
05:02:36.52 --> 05:02:46.36
And there is a way out and there is light and there is life out there and it is good.

5987
05:02:46.36 --> 05:02:48.72
But you got to hang in there.

5988
05:02:48.72 --> 05:02:58.16
You got to never give up and you got to remember that you are never out of the fight.

5989
05:02:58.16 --> 05:03:01.92
So keep on fighting.

5990
05:03:01.92 --> 05:03:06.28
And until next time, Zeko and Jocko out.
