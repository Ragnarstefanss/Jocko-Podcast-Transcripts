[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 120.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.
[00:00:07] Good evening, I go.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:09] So it's been a while since Q&A.
[00:00:12] Yeah.
[00:00:13] So we have some Q&A from the interwebs.
[00:00:16] Yeah.
[00:00:17] Go.
[00:00:18] First question.
[00:00:20] Jockel.
[00:00:23] More than once on the podcast, you've mentioned how the teams were so competitive
[00:00:28] that no one wanted to admit when they were cold, being too cold puts you at a tactical disadvantage.
[00:00:34] In hindsight, was that a failure to control your ego?
[00:00:37] So your ego doesn't control you.
[00:00:40] I didn't ask this question out of idle curiosity.
[00:00:42] A lot of folks in an active duty listed to the podcast and I'm concerned they might put
[00:00:46] themselves.
[00:00:47] Their teammates and their mission in jeopardy because of their ego's won't let them admit
[00:00:51] their too hot or too cold.
[00:00:53] All right.
[00:00:54] So good question.
[00:00:59] Good point.
[00:01:00] And there's definitely a big difference between being uncomfortably cold, right?
[00:01:03] Like you're just uncomfortably cold or uncomfortably hot or uncomfortably thirsty or
[00:01:08] hungry or whatever.
[00:01:10] And being in an actual state where you're putting the mission in jeopardy because you're
[00:01:14] too cold or hot or thirsty or whatever.
[00:01:18] So I just needed to say this.
[00:01:20] In the teams, you are 95% of the time you are cold, too cold, too hot, too wet, too
[00:01:28] thirsty, too miserable, something.
[00:01:31] There's no time.
[00:01:32] When you're in the field, you put on a hundred pounds worse or worse or worse or worse
[00:01:35] or worse or worse or worse or worse or worse or worse.
[00:01:36] You're uncomfortable from the word go.
[00:01:39] From the word go.
[00:01:41] And you're cold.
[00:01:43] You come in over the beach.
[00:01:45] You're in wet camis.
[00:01:47] It doesn't matter.
[00:01:48] You come out with great technology.
[00:01:49] We got to dry suit of this.
[00:01:51] We got to wet suit that.
[00:01:52] No, you're miserable.
[00:01:54] You're going to be cold.
[00:01:55] You're going to be uncomfortable.
[00:01:56] You're riding a zodiac.
[00:01:58] First you're riding a big rib, which is like a 10 meter boat.
[00:02:04] And you have your zodiacs on that boat.
[00:02:07] So you're in that boat.
[00:02:07] You're getting sprayed with water.
[00:02:09] You're getting bounced up and down.
[00:02:11] You do that for three hours.
[00:02:13] And then you launch your little boats into the water.
[00:02:15] Well, while you're doing that, you fall in the water.
[00:02:17] You slip, you get sprayed more, you're covered in water.
[00:02:20] By the way, the water's not warm.
[00:02:23] And then you've got to, because you're going to travel then 15 knots.
[00:02:26] So you've got to feel facing a 15 knot headwind for the another two hours in a zodiac.
[00:02:31] And then you're going to get in the water and swim both between.
[00:02:34] You're going to be cold.
[00:02:35] That's just the way it is.
[00:02:37] And you can't complain about that.
[00:02:39] So and you don't complain about it.
[00:02:41] In the teams, you just keep your mouth shut.
[00:02:43] That's what you do.
[00:02:44] Keep your mouth shut.
[00:02:45] The big distinction here is this is correct.
[00:02:48] If you're going to get high pithermia or you're going to get a heat stroke or you're going
[00:02:52] to go down from dehydration, then yeah, you've got to speak up and be, you're going to say,
[00:02:55] hey, guess what?
[00:02:56] I got an issue here.
[00:02:58] I'm starting to get dizzy or I'm starting to get lightheaded or whatever.
[00:03:02] Yeah, if you cross the line to where it goes from discomfort to actual problem, then you
[00:03:08] definitely need to speak up.
[00:03:13] It does happen.
[00:03:14] It happens a lot actually.
[00:03:15] When we do our land warfare training in the desert, in the summertime, it's 120 degree heat.
[00:03:23] You're going to take heat catch.
[00:03:24] Please, when I was running training, we used to just have premeditated heat casualties
[00:03:27] evacuation.
[00:03:28] Because we knew someone was going to go down.
[00:03:30] That's just the way it's going to happen.
[00:03:33] Because you've got 40 guys that are all turning and burning and they're all running on
[00:03:38] three or four hours of sleep.
[00:03:40] And then they're going out in the field and they just got back from the field and there's
[00:03:44] no time to rehydrate.
[00:03:46] Okay, there's time, but some guys might forget to rehydrate.
[00:03:50] Next thing you know, you've got to go down.
[00:03:52] The stuff does happen.
[00:03:56] Yeah, you've got to let your team know it's going on.
[00:03:59] The closest call I had, I was on a long patrol training patrol in the Ozark Mountains
[00:04:07] of Arkansas, it was summertime, it was hot.
[00:04:10] We were planning to pump water, meaning you bring a little water filtration system into
[00:04:14] the field and you get to a stream and you can fill your canteens and it's great and
[00:04:17] it seems like you have water forever because it streams.
[00:04:20] Well, the way the patrol went, we started off in pairs and then we linked up with fire
[00:04:25] team and then we linked up with squad and then you look up with a platoon.
[00:04:28] Well while we were in the squad, link up, we, for whatever reason, the course that I was
[00:04:34] on, I didn't hit water, we had a couple of streams that were supposed to be there and
[00:04:38] they weren't because they're intermittent streams.
[00:04:40] So sometimes streams aren't running year round and the time of year it was, the streams
[00:04:44] weren't running.
[00:04:45] So the first one, I was like, okay, okay, got to, so you'll up over a mountain, come
[00:04:49] back down the other side, get to this where the stream is marked intermittent stream
[00:04:52] is marked on a map.
[00:04:54] Guess what, no stream.
[00:04:56] So by that time I was out of water.
[00:04:59] So now coming, the next day, I said to myself, you know, if there's not water on this
[00:05:04] next stream, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have issues and then it wasn't water the next day.
[00:05:09] So yeah, that's, but I started to feel the dehydration coming on me.
[00:05:14] That's why I hate being thirsty.
[00:05:16] I always carry as much water as I can.
[00:05:19] You gotta be paranoid about being thirsty.
[00:05:21] Once you start going down from a dehydration, it's really a bad situation.
[00:05:25] You went the whole day?
[00:05:26] No, it was two days.
[00:05:27] Yeah, I had water going in, but I didn't have a ton of water.
[00:05:32] I should have had one, well, I should have maybe two more meters of water as a, as a just in case.
[00:05:39] But I didn't, I didn't, I didn't carry.
[00:05:41] Yeah, because you gotta carry it.
[00:05:42] Now you're heavier, now you're sweating more.
[00:05:44] So there's a little balance, you gotta figure it out.
[00:05:47] But yeah, you can't be a problem.
[00:05:49] Yes, I have seen it become a problem where guys, egos too big.
[00:05:53] They don't want to admit it for sure.
[00:05:54] So yes, this is a good warning.
[00:05:56] Don't let your ego get you in real trouble because that's gonna hurt your platoon even
[00:06:00] more.
[00:06:01] So don't let that happen.
[00:06:03] Don't let your ego prevent you from telling the truth about what's happening.
[00:06:09] And this happens in, this is gonna happen in the business world too.
[00:06:13] Where, oh, you know what?
[00:06:15] I don't really know how to operate this piece of equipment, but I'm not gonna say anything.
[00:06:18] I'm just gonna try and do it.
[00:06:20] Well, that's how someone gets hurt.
[00:06:21] So again, that's an ego problem.
[00:06:23] When you have an issue, when you know you can't do something or you've never done something
[00:06:26] before, step up and raise your hand.
[00:06:30] Now of course, you should have done the research, you should have, you know, you should have
[00:06:34] figured some stuff out on your own.
[00:06:36] But if you failed to do that, don't dig the whole deeper.
[00:06:40] Raise your hand, say what the problem was.
[00:06:42] There you go.
[00:06:43] Good question.
[00:06:44] Yeah, make sense.
[00:06:45] Because especially the thirst thing, like the dehydration thing, yeah, you don't want
[00:06:50] to be the guy saying, oh, I'm thirst.
[00:06:53] Here's the, I think nowadays though, like teams and coaches, here's the thing in football.
[00:06:58] So pop one or football, they'd be like, yeah, no water.
[00:07:02] You know, we have a water break.
[00:07:03] You drink water at the water break.
[00:07:04] Otherwise you're practicing.
[00:07:05] You know, kind of thing.
[00:07:06] It's like a tough and you're up thing.
[00:07:07] But man, that can jam your health up.
[00:07:10] Yeah, but let's face it.
[00:07:11] I mean, it would be pretty rare.
[00:07:13] If you gave people the, if you're doing a practice, what the how long is a practice last
[00:07:17] two hours?
[00:07:18] Okay, bro, you can make it two hours.
[00:07:22] If you're properly hydrated now, if a person's not properly hydrated, going into the
[00:07:25] practice, sure, that can, that can be a problem.
[00:07:27] But if someone is properly hydrated, going into the situation, it should not be a problem.
[00:07:32] And I'll say what, if you are in the military and you're going in the field, man, pre-hydrate
[00:07:36] like that, you used to save me so much from carrying so much water, just drinks so much
[00:07:41] water.
[00:07:42] Now, take where the problem comes in, you're in a helicopter ride for an hour and a half.
[00:07:45] Yeah.
[00:07:46] And you got to piss so bad.
[00:07:48] Yeah.
[00:07:49] It's awful.
[00:07:50] Well, you know what, bring a little, bring a little plastic bottle with you.
[00:07:51] So you can piss into the bottle.
[00:07:53] That's the way less of an issue.
[00:07:54] I think, like, finding a place to drink versus, for sure.
[00:07:57] It's way to be able to have to.
[00:07:58] But yeah, if you pre-hydrate properly, no matter how hard you're working, you can go
[00:08:03] like 12 hours without any water.
[00:08:06] Which is pretty legit.
[00:08:07] For, you know, kind of an average seal mission, 12 hours, get your brilliant plenty of
[00:08:11] time.
[00:08:12] Yeah.
[00:08:13] But kid, I mean, I'm talking pop warning here.
[00:08:15] So, you know, we're on a no-gjog.
[00:08:17] We're not talking to you.
[00:08:18] We're talking pop warning.
[00:08:19] Yeah.
[00:08:20] But here's the weird thing.
[00:08:22] Like when you went to high school college, they'd have water right there, right there
[00:08:26] on the sideline.
[00:08:27] And they, you know, they're really aware of, hey, you need good, you need water, drink
[00:08:31] more water.
[00:08:32] Well, I think that was also the time.
[00:08:33] Yeah, that's the, actually the point.
[00:08:35] The era, the era, right?
[00:08:37] Like, when we were kids, no one ever, ever, one single time in my whole, from the time
[00:08:42] I was zero until I was 18.
[00:08:45] No one ever said to me, hey, make sure you drink water.
[00:08:49] Never, never heard anyone say that.
[00:08:51] It was like, oh, you're thirsty drink a Coke.
[00:08:53] You know, that's the way it was.
[00:08:56] So that changed for you in that time period.
[00:08:58] Yeah.
[00:08:59] When I got to, when I got to seal training, when I got a buds, that's when they were
[00:09:03] saying, oh, you're going to stay hydrated.
[00:09:06] I thought it was kind of a joke.
[00:09:07] I thought they were getting hit first.
[00:09:08] Yeah, nuts.
[00:09:09] Like, what do you tell them about hydrogen, you mean drink water?
[00:09:11] What do you mean?
[00:09:12] Why would you call it something else?
[00:09:13] Hydrated.
[00:09:14] Yeah.
[00:09:15] What are your thirst ever?
[00:09:16] Yeah.
[00:09:17] Like, it's like this mate, will you shut?
[00:09:20] Because you can go down from like heat, kid, this like for there's heat exhaustion.
[00:09:24] Heat stroke, heat exhaustion.
[00:09:25] Yeah.
[00:09:26] And heat.
[00:09:27] There's all kinds of heat injuries you can get.
[00:09:28] Yeah.
[00:09:29] And you get heat stroke, but you can straight up die.
[00:09:30] Oh, yeah.
[00:09:31] So that's not, you know, it's not a matter of like, oh, yeah, tough it out.
[00:09:34] But you can't tough it out.
[00:09:35] You're shutting down.
[00:09:36] Kind of big.
[00:09:37] That's for sure.
[00:09:38] So, you know, that is important.
[00:09:39] It's for the heat thing.
[00:09:40] And I guess that is.
[00:09:41] That is.
[00:09:42] And that's going back to this question.
[00:09:44] That is probably why we would see heat casualties in training because guys do not want
[00:09:50] to say anything.
[00:09:51] They're like man, I'm not going to say anything.
[00:09:52] Yeah.
[00:09:53] I'm not going to get it now.
[00:09:54] Keep it worse.
[00:09:55] That's what happened.
[00:09:56] You could stuck with an IV now you're laying in the field.
[00:09:58] Everyone else, by the way, continues on doing another 10 kilometer hump to a target.
[00:10:03] And you're sitting there laid up in the ambulance like a little baby.
[00:10:07] No one wants that.
[00:10:09] But if you pre-high-pre-high-pre-high-pre-prop, you won't be in that situation.
[00:10:12] Yeah.
[00:10:13] But if you are going to get that situation, you need to say something.
[00:10:16] Yeah.
[00:10:17] We're talking about your life.
[00:10:19] Yeah.
[00:10:20] Essentially.
[00:10:21] And more important.
[00:10:22] We're talking about the mission.
[00:10:23] Yeah.
[00:10:24] I'm still thinking about the potworn of situation.
[00:10:27] Yeah, man.
[00:10:28] I dig it and you are correct.
[00:10:29] I can't help it.
[00:10:30] I agree with you 100%.
[00:10:33] That question.
[00:10:34] Jockel.
[00:10:35] Dear Jockel.
[00:10:37] My chosen community has lost and continues to lose members due to suicide.
[00:10:43] One reason is that they don't ask for help.
[00:10:46] I think one reason they don't ask for help is that they're afraid of being or being seen
[00:10:51] as weak.
[00:10:53] Somewhere that this takes strength and discipline to be able to perceive when you need help
[00:10:59] and to ask for it.
[00:11:00] I don't know how to convey that to them.
[00:11:03] Could you address how one can gather support from their team without losing face?
[00:11:07] So there's an obvious reason why I paired these two questions together because they're both
[00:11:11] very, very similar.
[00:11:13] And it's the same thing.
[00:11:15] And if we don't, if a member of your team won't come forward and admit they haven't
[00:11:20] issued, then the issue is not going to get addressed.
[00:11:23] And this is the same exact thing they have to explain to your team.
[00:11:26] Like, hey, if you start going down because you're dehydrated or you're starting getting
[00:11:31] getting frostbite and you need to get warmed up, you need to say something.
[00:11:37] If you don't say something, that's going to hurt the whole team.
[00:11:40] That's what's bad.
[00:11:42] So I think that's important.
[00:11:44] I think that's important to make sure everyone understands that this part of being a good
[00:11:48] operator is knowing your limitations and when you reach your limitations, raising your hand
[00:11:54] and saying, hey, this is a problem.
[00:11:57] And believe me, there's guys that might complain about little things and they're eventually
[00:12:03] going to be labeled as a little complainer, right?
[00:12:06] And they don't really have issues.
[00:12:08] So there's a fine line, right?
[00:12:10] There's a fine line.
[00:12:12] But for someone that's having some kind of mental stress, well, again, we got to recognize
[00:12:20] what's going on.
[00:12:21] We got to recognize that it's impacting us negatively at work.
[00:12:24] So that means you got to raise your hand.
[00:12:25] If it's having a negative impact on the way you're performing, then you got to raise your
[00:12:28] hand.
[00:12:29] And I think it's important to explain to people that this is something that happens to
[00:12:35] can happen to everybody.
[00:12:37] And it's not a negative thing.
[00:12:39] It's just a reality.
[00:12:40] It's kind of like it reminds me of being afraid, right?
[00:12:44] And if you're, let's say you got a new guy that's never done anything before and he doesn't
[00:12:51] know that he's going to be afraid, going on an operation, then he's going to wonder why
[00:12:56] a stomach is upset or why he's second guess himself or why he can't sleep.
[00:13:00] Like, oh, you can't sleep.
[00:13:02] Guess what?
[00:13:03] That's normal.
[00:13:04] You're going on a hardcore combat operation tomorrow.
[00:13:07] The fact that you can't sleep is completely normal. The fact that you feel sick, your stomach
[00:13:11] is completely normal.
[00:13:12] The fact that you're, you're, you're shaking.
[00:13:14] Those things are normal.
[00:13:15] Like, you're going to feel those.
[00:13:16] That's okay.
[00:13:17] It's not that big of a deal.
[00:13:19] And those things are just fear.
[00:13:21] That's what they are.
[00:13:22] And if you know what they are and you know that fear is okay and it's acceptable and it's
[00:13:28] actually kind of good, right?
[00:13:30] Because if, if you're not feeling any fear whatsoever, then you know, you've got some, well,
[00:13:36] you should be feeling afraid.
[00:13:38] You should feel fear.
[00:13:39] That should, that should propel you.
[00:13:40] It should get you on edge.
[00:13:42] Those are all those things are actually happening for a reason.
[00:13:44] So there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:13:47] And I think that's the same thing that you got to explain to people with stress.
[00:13:50] Like, oh, okay, that you can have too much fear.
[00:13:53] You keep someone at that heightened state for an extended period of time.
[00:13:57] Well, that's called combat stress and it's real and it can happen.
[00:14:01] It can happen anyone.
[00:14:02] And you know what?
[00:14:03] Because if we talked about on this podcast where you can see stress, combat stress taking
[00:14:08] it's toll on people.
[00:14:10] And when it does, you know, we've talked about it many times.
[00:14:15] If you get to that point, you need a break and dick winners from Banda Brothers.
[00:14:20] You know, he would give those guys breaks without them even knowing that he was given
[00:14:24] a break.
[00:14:25] Hey, echo, you got to go back and do a little logistics run for four days.
[00:14:28] Just make sure we have more supplies coming away.
[00:14:30] Get you off the front line, get you a breather.
[00:14:33] So that way, again, the same metaphor I've used before is if you have an engine in the
[00:14:38] red and you keep running it, what's going to happen in the engine?
[00:14:41] It's going to burn out.
[00:14:42] It's not going to be usable.
[00:14:43] If you have someone that's psychologically stressed and they're in the red and you keep
[00:14:46] running them in the red, guess what?
[00:14:47] Eventually they're not going to be usable anymore.
[00:14:49] So you need to give them a break, get them off the line.
[00:14:51] Because if you do take an engine, if you're engine like check engine like comes on and you
[00:14:55] go and get it maintained, get it fixed, the engine's still good.
[00:14:58] If you keep running it, the engine will be destroyed.
[00:15:00] So you got to do that with your people.
[00:15:02] You got to make sure everybody knows and I think that's a real simple metaphor to use
[00:15:06] with people as well.
[00:15:07] Say, look, we're running hard and we're going to put some stress on the engine.
[00:15:11] And if you don't keep the engine maintained, the engine's going to break and you won't
[00:15:14] be any good to the team.
[00:15:15] You won't be any good for the mission.
[00:15:16] So if you start feeling your engine like go on, you got to let someone know so we can
[00:15:21] give you the proper maintenance.
[00:15:23] And that's it.
[00:15:24] Jody Middick talked about that too.
[00:15:25] Jody was saying, hey, you know, basically if you get injured, if you break your ankle,
[00:15:32] they don't just expect you just to keep going.
[00:15:34] No, like, okay, you need to get back and you need to rehab while the same thing can happen
[00:15:38] to your brain.
[00:15:39] Your brain gets a break in it.
[00:15:41] You don't just keep driving or it's going to fracture a fall apart.
[00:15:44] What do you do?
[00:15:45] You take a break.
[00:15:46] You get down time and you get recovered and then you'll be ready to rock and roll again.
[00:15:53] So two really good questions to start it off.
[00:15:56] You know, again, especially for folks out there on the battlefield.
[00:15:59] And then it's not just for people on the battlefield because it happens with any group of
[00:16:04] people that are in a stressful environment.
[00:16:05] I mean, obviously cops get put into a really stressful environment all the time.
[00:16:10] Well, if you need to take a breather, you need to say something before you, before you
[00:16:14] burn out the engine.
[00:16:15] Yeah.
[00:16:16] Same thing with business world, right?
[00:16:18] People in the business world get extremely stressed out.
[00:16:21] Well, you probably need to break at some point.
[00:16:23] Make sure you work that in there.
[00:16:26] You don't like, like, police have like a mandatory program or mandatory situation where,
[00:16:34] you know, you go through, I think we're like, when they shoot someone or something like
[00:16:37] that, like mandatory, you have to go to like some kind of like counseling.
[00:16:40] Yeah, most of them do now or yeah.
[00:16:42] Yeah.
[00:16:43] So that makes sense too because even if let's say you don't necessarily need it or whatever,
[00:16:49] right, you go through a shooting situation, you got to go a mandatory and then, oh,
[00:16:52] I got to go through it.
[00:16:53] It's good that everyone kind of does it because it seems like, oh, it takes away the negative
[00:16:59] this deep, you know, like, kind of like, oh, I'm the only guy.
[00:17:03] You know, I'm the only guy that apparently feels this way.
[00:17:05] I'm looking around.
[00:17:06] No one else is going to counseling.
[00:17:07] Yeah.
[00:17:08] And now I'm the only guy.
[00:17:09] I must be the weak guy.
[00:17:10] So I don't, I'm not saying that.
[00:17:11] Yeah, they've done that somewhat in the military of, hey, when you come home from the
[00:17:15] planet, everyone's going to go talk to talk to, what is it a psychotherapy or something?
[00:17:21] Yeah.
[00:17:22] Just they kind of do that.
[00:17:24] I know they did that in the school teams where they'd be everyone would go, they didn't
[00:17:28] do all I was in.
[00:17:29] They'd give it, you like a piece of paper to fill out, which everyone just got in a gun
[00:17:33] decked.
[00:17:34] You know, what does that mean?
[00:17:36] Yeah.
[00:17:37] Just pencil whip.
[00:17:38] I don't know what, I don't know.
[00:17:39] It just like, you know, fill it out except for Tony.
[00:17:42] You know, Tony wrote on the head of his, what?
[00:17:45] He wrote, this is a cry for help.
[00:17:47] That was pretty funny.
[00:17:51] But anyways, that was, he filled out like a whole fake one about just a funny one.
[00:17:56] Yeah.
[00:17:57] Dang.
[00:17:58] I got a fake out of it.
[00:17:59] Yeah.
[00:18:00] But it makes sense, though, because of that.
[00:18:02] Because that's kind of the, that's really the most important way to do things.
[00:18:05] It's the smart way to do things.
[00:18:06] Let's give everyone a baseline sort of, okay, check.
[00:18:10] Here you go.
[00:18:11] Yeah.
[00:18:12] And that way, no one has to go.
[00:18:14] No one has to take raise their hand first.
[00:18:16] Yeah.
[00:18:17] You're all going to talk to somebody.
[00:18:18] I think it's a smart thing to do.
[00:18:19] Yeah.
[00:18:20] Yeah.
[00:18:21] Because it's kind of the thing, right?
[00:18:23] It kind of goes along with the earlier question too.
[00:18:25] Like, if it's a water break and hey, guys, water break, everyone's drinking water.
[00:18:30] So now it's like, you don't have to feel like, the one plus who like needs this water.
[00:18:37] Oh, yeah.
[00:18:38] Yeah.
[00:18:39] Oh, yeah.
[00:18:40] No, no.
[00:18:41] That's the exact same thing.
[00:18:42] Yeah.
[00:18:43] So yeah.
[00:18:44] If you got an issue man, speak up.
[00:18:46] Everyone knows, you know, that way you can do your job.
[00:18:49] You can do it longer.
[00:18:50] You can do it better.
[00:18:51] Your goal is to do the, is to be the best possible that you, be the best possible capability
[00:18:57] so that you can go out and do your job the best.
[00:19:00] If you've, if you've got issues, you've got to say something so that you can keep doing
[00:19:03] your job for the team.
[00:19:05] Yeah.
[00:19:06] It's like, like, don't look at yourself as being weak.
[00:19:10] Look at yourself is trying to optimize your strength kind of go.
[00:19:13] You know, maybe just a flip over the way you look at it.
[00:19:16] There it is.
[00:19:17] Next question.
[00:19:18] Do you think martial arts tournaments are the most effective way for preparing for
[00:19:23] physical confrontation?
[00:19:25] I just competed my second due to tournament as a three straight white belt.
[00:19:31] In one match, I completely lost focus and control of my mind because I believe I was taken
[00:19:36] a back by the strength and wildness of my opponent in a big 100%.
[00:19:43] I barely, I can barely even remember how the match unfolded.
[00:19:47] I've given this match significant thought and I concluded that I need to compete more.
[00:19:52] I'm very comfortable with everyone in my academy.
[00:19:55] I trust that as I roll with without question, they're like family now.
[00:19:59] The guy, the guy in the tournament was a total stranger.
[00:20:03] He was unknown and therefore he listed fear.
[00:20:06] I allowed myself to be crippled by fear.
[00:20:09] Is there any other way to overcome this beyond competing tournaments?
[00:20:13] Thank you.
[00:20:14] All right.
[00:20:17] You know, competing is definitely part of it.
[00:20:21] And it's interesting that he's asking if this is the most effective way to prepare for
[00:20:25] a physical confrontation.
[00:20:27] It is a very good way to help you prepare for a physical confrontation.
[00:20:34] And the bottom line is competing.
[00:20:35] One of the things that's true with competing and it's true with anything is that the
[00:20:41] more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the more familiar it will become.
[00:20:48] I know that sounds pretty obvious, but the more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the
[00:20:53] more familiar it will become.
[00:20:55] So you get to become familiar with things that are unfamiliar.
[00:20:58] And you learn how to handle things that you aren't expecting.
[00:21:03] In the teams, we always talk about your first free fall jump when you learn how to skydive
[00:21:08] with the free fall rig.
[00:21:10] And your first jump seems like it's like three seconds long, even though it's a minute.
[00:21:15] Even though it's a minute because you're all amped up and you all you see is your
[00:21:18] altimeter and the more you jump the more you see.
[00:21:22] Until that minute, I mean, have you ever tried to hold your breath for a minute?
[00:21:26] That's like a long time, right?
[00:21:28] But and that's that's the amount of time that can take up a free fall can be a nice
[00:21:33] long minute where you're observing all these different things.
[00:21:36] But when you first start doing it, it doesn't seem very long.
[00:21:39] I'm sure if we had Andy, Andy Stumpfon here, his one minute free fall price seems like
[00:21:45] a really, really long time because he's got thousands of of jumps.
[00:21:50] And so this is the same thing, the more you train for chaos, the more accustomed you're
[00:21:59] going to become to the chaos.
[00:22:01] Now what's great is in this particular case, he's talking about this guy's just wild and
[00:22:05] crazy and hey, if you survive it that first time, well, the next time someone goes wild
[00:22:10] and crazy, like, okay, well, here's what I need to do.
[00:22:12] I need to put this in check.
[00:22:13] I need to hold on.
[00:22:14] I need to make sure he, I don't give any positions, but I'm not going to get crazy.
[00:22:17] I'm just going to absorb some, you go through that mental drill and the more you go through
[00:22:22] that mental drill, the better you will get at it.
[00:22:26] And this is true.
[00:22:27] This is true with anything.
[00:22:28] And that's why, you know, when I was running the sales training, we put the, we would
[00:22:32] make it.
[00:22:34] So we'd hit people with the most random possible things because that's what prepares you
[00:22:37] for random possible things is random possible things.
[00:22:40] That's what you want to deal with.
[00:22:42] It's kind of weird, you know, in Gjitsu, Dean, Dean, you used to talk about this.
[00:22:46] And now you can hear John Donner talking about it as well.
[00:22:49] And if, if you have never been in a certain situation before, you're not ready for it.
[00:22:56] And when, okay, so there's a, there's a position in, in Gjitsu called 5050, right?
[00:23:02] That's what it's called now.
[00:23:04] We used to call it Kakaraco because that's the position that Dean was in when he beat
[00:23:09] a guy named Kakaraco for the ADCC, World Championships.
[00:23:13] And Dean, Dean calls that position 9010 because he's been in it so much that even though
[00:23:20] it's a neutral position, meaning we both have the same advantages and disadvantages.
[00:23:25] When Dean's in that position, he's been in it so much that he's got a 90% chance.
[00:23:29] He's got a 90% chance to success because he's been there 10 times, 20 times, 30 times
[00:23:34] more than you.
[00:23:35] And I heard John Donner talking about the same thing the other day.
[00:23:38] He's getting his, his Gjitsu fighters right now are doing things to guys that are, that
[00:23:45] they're putting people in positions that the person's not used to.
[00:23:48] So if you're not used to it, guess what?
[00:23:49] You're an advantage, even though I might have trained, even though let's say I'm a Gjitsu
[00:23:52] Black belt.
[00:23:54] And I've been training for 20 years.
[00:23:56] If I've never been in this particular position before, it's, I might as well be a white belt
[00:24:01] mechanism.
[00:24:02] You can see that happening.
[00:24:04] You can see that happening in Gjitsu.
[00:24:05] That's why when somebody comes up with a new, new type of moves, that move can be effective
[00:24:11] for a little while.
[00:24:12] Like let's say you came up with a new move.
[00:24:14] You might catch me in that new move one time.
[00:24:16] And then I go, I know what he did.
[00:24:18] But now, if instead of just a new move, you had a whole new area that I had to learn.
[00:24:24] Yeah, then I had to learn a whole new deal.
[00:24:26] It's the same thing with Eddie Bravo and 10th planet.
[00:24:29] You know, like they were doing things like, oh, I've never been in this position before.
[00:24:33] Now what do I do?
[00:24:35] They were catching guys like that.
[00:24:37] And then the more people figure out that part of that system.
[00:24:40] Okay, well, then you get better at it and we get to a neutral ground again.
[00:24:44] But anytime you can, so in training, anytime you can get to be put yourself in a situation
[00:24:49] that you haven't been before, it's going to be beneficial to you.
[00:24:52] Now what is, how does this translate to real physical confrontations?
[00:24:56] Right?
[00:24:57] How do you train for that?
[00:24:58] Well, how often are you putting on gloves and Gjitsu?
[00:25:01] How often are you having somebody punch you in the face?
[00:25:03] How often are you having somebody come up and push you around?
[00:25:07] How often are you having people do things that people can do in a street fight?
[00:25:11] Right?
[00:25:12] People are going to do in a street fight that they wouldn't normally do in a Gjitsu match.
[00:25:15] Right?
[00:25:16] For instance, in a street fight is anyone ever start on the knees?
[00:25:20] Right?
[00:25:21] They don't start on the knees.
[00:25:22] They don't start on the knees and street fight.
[00:25:24] You don't say, hey, you want to fight me and then you didn't get down on your knees.
[00:25:27] And so does the other guy.
[00:25:28] Now we figure out what happens.
[00:25:29] No, street fights don't start on the knees.
[00:25:32] So you're almost, and people ask me this, actually somebody asks me the other day, what
[00:25:37] should I do when starting from the knees?
[00:25:39] What's a good take down?
[00:25:40] I'm like, oh, my God, pull guard.
[00:25:41] Because why are you on your knees?
[00:25:43] The best thing to do if your opponent is on their knees, stand up and kick them in the
[00:25:45] face.
[00:25:46] Right?
[00:25:47] You're not going to be, why would you be on your knees?
[00:25:51] Yeah.
[00:25:53] So don't practice that.
[00:25:54] So how do you prepare for the best way to prepare for these combat situations is, is
[00:26:00] Gjitsu tournament a good way?
[00:26:02] Yes, it is a good way.
[00:26:03] Is boxing is boxing a good way?
[00:26:06] Is it good to do a smokers?
[00:26:07] So you figure out what it's like when somebody, you want to talk about someone going
[00:26:10] wild with you.
[00:26:12] You get someone that's untrained in boxing come thrown, thrown, you know, windmill
[00:26:16] hammakers at you, 38 in a row.
[00:26:18] Now they're going to be exhausted after that first 32 seconds.
[00:26:22] But you will have had to have withstand and not get punched in the head.
[00:26:28] Yeah.
[00:26:29] Because if you get punched in the head by a wild hammaker, I don't care who you are.
[00:26:31] If they connect with your chin, there's a possibility you might go down.
[00:26:34] So you need to be careful that.
[00:26:36] So don't just think, oh, just Gjitsu, hey, go out, train some boxing, train some
[00:26:41] moitai and go in sparr.
[00:26:44] And if you can do a smokers because smokers pretty easy to do, in other words, you don't
[00:26:51] need to do like a full preparation camp and all that.
[00:26:56] Yeah.
[00:26:57] It's an unofficial event.
[00:26:59] So you go do a smokers and you're going to experience somebody going wild on you, throwing
[00:27:03] haymakers at you, throwing crazy kicks at you.
[00:27:06] Do that, do all these things to get ready for those physical competitions.
[00:27:11] And then you also on top of that, you read and you look at YouTube videos.
[00:27:16] Go watch YouTube.
[00:27:17] I've talked about this before.
[00:27:18] Go watch YouTube videos and street fights because you get to see what people, what
[00:27:21] kind of things people do, which can be very effective.
[00:27:26] Right?
[00:27:27] So learn to watch out for soccer punches.
[00:27:28] You need to learn to watch out, watch your back and watch your sneaking up on you and
[00:27:32] be aware of your surroundings and put your back against the wall.
[00:27:34] You know, there's all these little things that you can do to make sure that you're not
[00:27:37] going to get soccer punched.
[00:27:39] But you got to pay attention to those things.
[00:27:41] Yeah.
[00:27:42] Yeah.
[00:27:43] That wildness that he talks about.
[00:27:46] Yeah.
[00:27:47] That is a huge thing.
[00:27:49] It's like a whole another factor, especially in exactly how he said he's real, he's real familiar
[00:27:56] with his training partners.
[00:27:58] So man, you know, the amount of cruising and kind of relax and even during the role,
[00:28:02] there's probably significant amount of it almost to the point where it seems like anyway
[00:28:06] where he kind of maybe expects that or even subconsciously kind of he understands that
[00:28:11] that's kind of part of the deal.
[00:28:13] You go against a complete stranger and he gets wild.
[00:28:17] And it's like, whoa, this is like, it's kind of overwhelming.
[00:28:20] Yeah.
[00:28:21] And also, even at the three stripe white belt level, this other guy,
[00:28:26] he may, he's got his little game.
[00:28:29] He's got his game that he plays.
[00:28:31] And there's a chance that as a three stripe white belt, you haven't learned that part
[00:28:35] of the game.
[00:28:36] So it just feels crazy.
[00:28:37] Yeah.
[00:28:38] And that whole, you know, when you compete for the first second time, you know, just a
[00:28:42] little earlier.
[00:28:43] See, that as the thing is, the more you train, the less holes there are.
[00:28:47] Yeah.
[00:28:48] Right.
[00:28:49] The less holes you are.
[00:28:50] There are in your game.
[00:28:51] And so if you're a three stripe white belt, you might not have good guard
[00:28:56] replacement, right?
[00:28:57] Like you really haven't learned how to replace the guard from cross side.
[00:29:00] Yeah.
[00:29:01] Well, if this guy happens to be a guy that holds really well across the
[00:29:05] side, and that's where he works his game from.
[00:29:06] Man, you're a big trouble.
[00:29:07] Yeah.
[00:29:08] You're a big trouble.
[00:29:09] Yeah.
[00:29:10] And it all seems so unpredictable too at those earlier stages, because you don't know
[00:29:14] where your holes are.
[00:29:15] I mean, you might know some, but you don't know.
[00:29:17] Yeah.
[00:29:18] You know, you haven't seen enough of the game.
[00:29:19] And you haven't been in enough situations where you can kind of stay calm and, you know,
[00:29:24] all the stuff.
[00:29:25] So to your point where you say you got to be familiar with the unfamiliar kind of thing.
[00:29:30] Remember when Majeed started just baseball bat choking everyone?
[00:29:33] Yeah.
[00:29:34] How was Lea's?
[00:29:35] Yeah.
[00:29:36] He's live weird setups.
[00:29:37] And he would let people pass his guard and then he'd be thinking, oh, I'm about to
[00:29:40] score some points on the and boom, they're getting tapped out.
[00:29:43] Yeah.
[00:29:44] But it was so foreign that, okay.
[00:29:48] So he went the two real, real famous ones at the time when he exploded on the
[00:29:51] scene with these was.
[00:29:53] He was Clark and Zach.
[00:29:55] Yeah.
[00:29:56] Back to the two matches and one of them Zach Maxwell mounted in Armbar.
[00:30:02] No, hasn't been the Armbar meanwhile baseball, but, yeah, choke is in.
[00:30:06] No, but who cares?
[00:30:07] Because really that rule could not, not rule, but that situation up kind of applies.
[00:30:11] If you have someone in Armbar, I don't care.
[00:30:13] You should be.
[00:30:14] Yep.
[00:30:15] I got the armbar to break your arm.
[00:30:16] He's going for the arm, but he can't lean back because the baseball, that
[00:30:18] choke is in and he's like, he got a tap.
[00:30:21] Yeah.
[00:30:22] And then I think he was Clark where he could have been the other way around, but
[00:30:27] either way, Clark has a, was Zach was going to block it.
[00:30:29] I was at these matches, weren't I?
[00:30:31] I know I was.
[00:30:32] Yeah, I wasn't.
[00:30:33] I was there by.
[00:30:34] So the videos, but yeah, the kind where Clark was like, I know this choke, I'm in
[00:30:39] mount or I'm in this good position.
[00:30:40] I know that this choke doesn't work.
[00:30:42] It simply doesn't work because I have the advantage and he gets choked unconscious because
[00:30:46] he doesn't tap.
[00:30:47] Sure, it might hurt.
[00:30:48] And that is the case for a lot of the, a lot of jokes where it's like, sure, this
[00:30:50] hurt.
[00:30:51] It's not a choke.
[00:30:52] No, a good one doesn't even hurt.
[00:30:54] Yeah, it's a good choke.
[00:30:55] It's just in.
[00:30:56] Yeah.
[00:30:57] So what we're talking about there is a guy named Mijid.
[00:30:58] What's Mijid's last name?
[00:31:00] He's.
[00:31:01] Yeah, that's right.
[00:31:02] And he came on to the scene.
[00:31:05] We'll say.
[00:31:06] Sure.
[00:31:07] With, well, this is what's interesting about this is the baseball bat choke is not a new
[00:31:11] choke.
[00:31:12] It's not a domain that people were unfamiliar with.
[00:31:14] It's just that he was doing it really, really well with really good setups that people,
[00:31:20] that's what, that's the part that people weren't expecting.
[00:31:22] It was a really good setup.
[00:31:23] They were really good setups of people weren't expecting.
[00:31:26] And so he'd let people pass their guard or his guard.
[00:31:30] But he had the choke in.
[00:31:31] They'd get across side and get mounted or whatever.
[00:31:33] Go for arm locks and they're tapping because they weren't expecting it.
[00:31:39] Yeah.
[00:31:40] And even if those, you know, I mean, Zach Maxwell and Clark Gracie, just phenomenal competitors
[00:31:45] Black belt, I mean, been training their whole lives, both of them got caught by that.
[00:31:50] Yeah, he's.
[00:31:51] Yeah, the legitimacy of like the way that whole thing went down was just so astounding.
[00:31:59] Like just like how you say, like Clark?
[00:32:02] Yeah.
[00:32:03] But Clark has been winning stuff from day one.
[00:32:05] That's when it's in.
[00:32:06] Yeah.
[00:32:07] And yeah, it's just crazy, but it just shows, you know, where you can, you can be that good.
[00:32:13] You get just that one teeny tiny window of familiarity.
[00:32:16] Yeah, that's what they got creeps in there.
[00:32:18] And he's familiar, but he'll just have his way.
[00:32:20] And then what was interesting is as people started knowing that that's what he's going
[00:32:25] to go for.
[00:32:26] But he'd still get it.
[00:32:27] Yeah.
[00:32:28] And actually, and I trained with him before, he had just, you know, a few times or whatever.
[00:32:32] And he didn't do that to me.
[00:32:35] And I was like, hey, you know, like, well, I didn't have some why didn't do it to me.
[00:32:38] But I was like, do people, you know, like, does everyone ask you to teach them or
[00:32:42] do he's like, you know what, people don't, I don't even really talk about anymore because
[00:32:46] I've become so well known for that move that it becomes, it became less a part of my life.
[00:32:51] Yeah.
[00:32:52] It could happen to where, okay, now once you go, okay, it goes through a phase of, hey,
[00:32:59] I wasn't expecting that.
[00:33:00] And it worked because I wasn't expecting it.
[00:33:02] Then it goes like, hey, I was expecting it, but it still worked.
[00:33:06] But then it gets to a point where people are just going, I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:08] Like, oh, if he grabs my collar, I need to go.
[00:33:10] It totally different direction. I need to not do anything, need to back out whatever.
[00:33:14] And then it becomes where, like you said, it's now it's losing some of its effectiveness
[00:33:19] because everyone is expecting that to be the move that you do.
[00:33:23] That's what happened with the 100% like where there'd be like, I don't care what position
[00:33:29] I mean, I don't care what position I have to give up.
[00:33:31] It's just do not get into that leglock position.
[00:33:34] It's like, you could tell with some of his matches, I was like, oh, yeah, she did.
[00:33:37] I get it.
[00:33:38] You know, I get it, but you have that is how it goes.
[00:33:41] But the chaos thing, I think he should compete more.
[00:33:46] Yes, that should compete more.
[00:33:47] For sure. But what I'm saying is compete in Gigiitsu for sure, but do some smokers, do some
[00:33:53] mojitai, do some wrestling matches, do some sombo turn, you know, get out there, do some different
[00:33:59] competitions and then on top of all that, man, do some scenario based training.
[00:34:04] You know, do some self defense based training at the Academy where somebody pulls out the
[00:34:10] the knife, the fake knife, whatever, what do they call the fake knife and like, let's make
[00:34:15] sure we know how to deal with that.
[00:34:17] Let's make sure we know how to deal with the baseball bat.
[00:34:19] Like, what are you going to do?
[00:34:20] What are you going to do?
[00:34:21] Because baseball bat, you know what you do with the baseball bat, close the distance.
[00:34:24] Yeah.
[00:34:25] You know, hey, that's not even really a game changer as long as you know what you're doing.
[00:34:30] Knife, close the distance with a knife and now you're getting stabbed.
[00:34:33] Yes.
[00:34:34] So, you got to make distance.
[00:34:36] Yeah.
[00:34:37] And again, man, that just that familiarity, like, once you go through it, that's like almost
[00:34:41] night and day and end of itself.
[00:34:43] Once you've seen it, if you've never seen it, if you've seen it once, like, that first
[00:34:47] step is night and day.
[00:34:48] So, that's good that he went through this.
[00:34:49] Really?
[00:34:50] Yeah.
[00:34:51] Yeah.
[00:34:52] And what's good, the other good, psychologically, you know, do you recognize psychologically,
[00:34:55] he recognized that he lost his mind?
[00:34:57] I got what he said.
[00:34:58] He said, uh, he did fear.
[00:35:01] Yeah, I got fear.
[00:35:03] Oh, is it?
[00:35:06] In one match, I completely lost focus and control of my mind.
[00:35:09] So, once you, that's just, and what you just said, when you get that, when you experience
[00:35:13] that, that's a good thing to experience because then you learn to recognize that you're
[00:35:17] losing control and you're losing your mind and you're going to, when you realize that, it
[00:35:22] allows you to start monitoring it.
[00:35:24] Yeah.
[00:35:25] You've never been to, because there's people that are listening to this right now that have
[00:35:27] never lost their mind before.
[00:35:28] They've never been overwhelmed by something.
[00:35:30] And just not knowing what to do, never been frozen.
[00:35:33] You've never been frozen with fear.
[00:35:35] Frozen with fear.
[00:35:36] If you've never felt your fight or flight thing engaged, then when it happens, you won't
[00:35:41] know what it is.
[00:35:42] Yeah.
[00:35:43] You want to know what it is.
[00:35:44] So that way when it happens, you can go, okay, know what's happening right here.
[00:35:47] Yeah.
[00:35:48] I'm going to make this, I'm going to make this decision.
[00:35:50] Yeah.
[00:35:51] And how you're saying, when you train boxing or, um, um, boxing, yeah, yeah, and MMA.
[00:35:58] So when you get hit in the face, when we talked about this before, when you get hit in the
[00:36:01] face, then you have it really been hit in the face before.
[00:36:04] Like, that's a, it'll throw you off.
[00:36:07] Oh, yeah.
[00:36:08] That's just to put really mildly it'll throw you off.
[00:36:10] So especially, yeah, you're right, because when you see someone get punched in the face
[00:36:15] and moving it, it seems like it doesn't really face in that match and they keep going.
[00:36:20] If that's what your expect is going to happen when you get punched in the face,
[00:36:22] that's the wrong idea.
[00:36:23] Yeah.
[00:36:24] Because what's going to, if you've never been punched in the face before when you get punched,
[00:36:26] it's a little shocker.
[00:36:27] Yeah.
[00:36:28] And there's pain and your eyes get blurry and you're, you get a little flash.
[00:36:32] I mean, there's a lot of things that go on when you get punched in the face.
[00:36:35] Once you get used to it, you're like, you can move right through it.
[00:36:37] Exactly.
[00:36:38] But if you're not used to it, it's a problem.
[00:36:40] Yeah.
[00:36:41] Fully.
[00:36:42] And it's, that's another one.
[00:36:43] It's night and day when a guy has been hit in the face a bunch of times and is used
[00:36:48] to it and a guy who's not used to it.
[00:36:49] Because, you know, like, you can hit a guy in a face or get hit in the face and they'll
[00:36:56] be like, I'm done.
[00:36:57] Like, I didn't really expect this encounter or this experience.
[00:37:02] You don't want to get it.
[00:37:03] And then, oh, they guys, they'll get hit in the face.
[00:37:04] Break their nose, break their jaw, all this stuff and they're keep fighting.
[00:37:07] You know, it's like, dang.
[00:37:09] So that night in a situation, if you're not used to it, which is essentially the same
[00:37:13] thing you went through.
[00:37:14] This guy went wild.
[00:37:15] He wasn't ready for this overwhelming experience and he losses my instinctive.
[00:37:20] Yeah.
[00:37:21] So you can hit in the face.
[00:37:22] Like, I'm regret punching me in my face.
[00:37:24] So hard.
[00:37:25] I don't know if he was mad or just regretting.
[00:37:30] Great.
[00:37:31] James fires it off.
[00:37:34] He punched me right between the eyes.
[00:37:36] Thought he broke my face.
[00:37:38] And it was the kind where it was a timing thing too, where I came in.
[00:37:40] I was shooting in and right before a level change or whatever, he just connected and
[00:37:45] was like, boom.
[00:37:46] And I remember thinking, because I just kept going.
[00:37:48] And I remember thinking, dang, I'm glad I was kind of used to getting hit in the face.
[00:37:51] That would have kind of, the very least paused me for a long time, like, didn't you?
[00:37:56] But I'm thinking, when you imagine just that kind of chaos and sensation that'll just stop
[00:38:01] you.
[00:38:02] But once you're used to it, you're good.
[00:38:03] And this is a good point to bring up with just with any kind of training at like leadership
[00:38:08] training, right?
[00:38:09] When you have leaders that haven't been put in certain situations before, that's why I
[00:38:13] actually love front.
[00:38:14] We do role playing exercises with people.
[00:38:16] And you put people in situations.
[00:38:17] The first time you put them in situations like dealing with a hostile subordinate that
[00:38:21] doesn't want to do the plan.
[00:38:23] The first time they get put in that scenario, they just, they just fall apart.
[00:38:27] I told you to do it in here.
[00:38:29] Okay, let's replay that.
[00:38:31] By the third time you're doing it, already handling the job, handling the scenario infinitely
[00:38:36] better, infinitely better than they did the first time.
[00:38:39] So it's the same with everything in life, like the exposure to it and the rehearsal
[00:38:44] of it gives you such a massive advantage that to not rehearse and to not train is, it's
[00:38:52] actually sad.
[00:38:54] And that's actually, the National Enfronts are great example because that's why we're
[00:38:57] in business because people don't even know that they should be doing this.
[00:39:02] And to go to a company that has 50, 100, 150, 200 leaders that are leading teams and they
[00:39:12] have no leadership training.
[00:39:14] And therefore we're all surprised when the leader doesn't get the teams to do what they're
[00:39:19] supposed to do.
[00:39:20] Who taught him how to lead?
[00:39:21] Because you just don't show, you just don't show up to work, no one how to lead.
[00:39:25] No, you actually get trained to lead.
[00:39:27] Yeah, all these unfamiliar micro scenarios happen in.
[00:39:31] That's one of the, that's one of the, like, the muster we do these little drills at the
[00:39:36] muster.
[00:39:37] And you could see, people are overwhelmed with the knowledge that they gained from two
[00:39:41] or three little scenarios that we put in front of them.
[00:39:44] And these are common scenarios that happen all the time.
[00:39:45] But when you watch seasoned business leaders, trying to handle a scenario that they haven't
[00:39:51] seen before.
[00:39:52] Now they might have seen it before, but they never actually had to deal with it.
[00:39:56] The first time they try to deal with it, they fall apart.
[00:39:58] And it's real, I've been, it takes like 10 seconds before you go, okay, let's just stop.
[00:40:03] Because you've already got this guy mad at you.
[00:40:05] Well, let's try this again.
[00:40:06] Because we haven't been through this situation before.
[00:40:09] They never been punched in the face before.
[00:40:11] Yeah.
[00:40:12] And that's the problem.
[00:40:13] Don't let it happen.
[00:40:14] Get punched in the face a few times.
[00:40:16] Yeah.
[00:40:17] Just you be.
[00:40:18] Yeah.
[00:40:19] You can do this.
[00:40:20] It's kind of like, remember when we were kids, there was this, this is, you know, like,
[00:40:23] really chewing gum.
[00:40:24] Yeah.
[00:40:25] And then the little packs that for five of them, they're just small little thing.
[00:40:28] And you, you know, you grab one and this one kind of stick in now, you can say, hey, you
[00:40:31] know, do you want one off of one of your friends.
[00:40:33] So it was my brother.
[00:40:36] And he did, long story, but he was crying from something else who you said.
[00:40:39] And he was like crying.
[00:40:40] And oh, by the way, you know, he offered me some gum.
[00:40:42] I grabbed the gum.
[00:40:43] And then he was like, oh, those mouse traps.
[00:40:44] Yeah.
[00:40:45] And it slaps you and kind of hurts with your little kitty anyway.
[00:40:48] And it snaps off.
[00:40:50] I'm like, dang, I never, you know, I see he's laughing.
[00:40:54] You cry from something else.
[00:40:55] And then he's laughing.
[00:40:56] And cheer them up, whatever.
[00:40:57] Double leg.
[00:40:58] He's not there for, well, actually, which would have made the double leg even better.
[00:41:04] Nonetheless, I'd never seen that before.
[00:41:07] Now someone offers me riggedly gum.
[00:41:10] I'm aware.
[00:41:11] I'm ready for that mouse trap.
[00:41:12] It may be the mouse trap, maybe not.
[00:41:14] Well, you're grabbing by the side.
[00:41:15] I'm driving by the side exactly right.
[00:41:17] Let's learn.
[00:41:18] Yeah, exactly right.
[00:41:19] I'll have to endure that.
[00:41:20] And one more minute.
[00:41:23] Life is no different.
[00:41:25] Next question.
[00:41:27] I'm a chef in a large operation kitchen.
[00:41:30] I'm second in command overseeing a large kitchen staff in part of a five-person management
[00:41:34] team overseeing the entire account.
[00:41:37] Recently, during my last review, I was giving some advice by my boss and his boss.
[00:41:41] I'm unsure about my last two annual reviews have gone very well.
[00:41:46] And I'm on the rise in the company.
[00:41:48] However, they said, if it was important for me to get or heat the however, they said,
[00:41:53] it was important for me to give up some of my kitchen dog mentality and work to showcase my artistic
[00:42:03] side and embrace more of a star role in the spotlight.
[00:42:07] Get out of the kitchen a bit more.
[00:42:09] Get more more gain more exposure specifically with their high profile clients.
[00:42:13] While I appreciate their sentiment and respect their big management skills, their style
[00:42:18] isn't one I strive to emulate or feel would work for me and the way I operate.
[00:42:24] I've always approached my work as more of a craft than an art and I've always like being a trench dog
[00:42:31] with my team.
[00:42:32] My team responds to it and I get results for the business and I feel the results should speak for them
[00:42:37] and I feel the results are not.
[00:42:39] It is propelled my career rapidly thus far.
[00:42:41] So why would I want to change and be something I'm not?
[00:42:44] Should I heat their advice or stick to what I do best?
[00:42:48] Keep getting after it on my terms.
[00:42:51] What are those questions?
[00:42:53] That's just funny how that last statement is framed.
[00:42:58] Should I stick to what I do best and keep getting after it?
[00:43:02] As if to say if you say no you should not stick to what you do best.
[00:43:07] You should not get after it.
[00:43:09] That's the frame there and actually this guy I answered the question real
[00:43:14] Tercely I think this came through Facebook messages that I said.
[00:43:18] Sounds like you found a comfortable little zone for yourself and you want to stay in there.
[00:43:23] Right little cold butter response and he's like,
[00:43:27] I knew it.
[00:43:29] Because as we know in the comfort zone there's no growth in the comfort zone.
[00:43:34] So it's interesting this guy is actually getting some good solid and straightforward advice from up the chain of command.
[00:43:43] Plus I think if they have him as more of a personality than the restaurant will do better and they're trying to build their reputation and your reputation at the same time.
[00:43:52] And that seems pretty reasonable to me right?
[00:43:55] Real familiar with the restaurant business but I'm familiar enough to know if you've got a good reputation with the staff that works at the restaurant.
[00:44:03] It brings in more people like there's no doubt about it.
[00:44:06] The relationship just like any other business.
[00:44:09] The relationships that you build with the customers strengthens them strengthens that relationship and makes them want to come back for more right?
[00:44:16] That's the way it works.
[00:44:18] And so for them to say to you, hey man, hey, you know you're a good cook. We get that. We need a little bit more. We want a little bit more.
[00:44:26] Chef.
[00:44:27] We need somebody that has, yeah chef.
[00:44:30] You're good chef.
[00:44:32] Yeah, yeah, sorry. You're a good chef.
[00:44:34] Well actually, what I think I might have actually purposely said that.
[00:44:39] Like hey, you're doing a good job in the kitchen as a cook.
[00:44:43] We don't need someone that's just cooking the food. We need a chef with a reputation with a personality, right?
[00:44:49] There's a difference there, right?
[00:44:51] So it was called out for a reason.
[00:44:53] Gotcha.
[00:44:54] He's happy and you can see like kitchen dog.
[00:44:58] Yeah, he's proud of that, right?
[00:44:59] And I get that man.
[00:45:01] I get that.
[00:45:02] I get that. Like you're one of the boys.
[00:45:04] You're back in the grind.
[00:45:06] Well let me ask you this.
[00:45:08] Or let me make this statement.
[00:45:10] Guess what you have to do is a seal.
[00:45:12] As a seal leader, guess what you have to do?
[00:45:14] You have to build relationships.
[00:45:16] You have to make your commanding officer trust you.
[00:45:19] You have to build relationships with the army.
[00:45:21] You have to build relationships through the Marine Corps.
[00:45:23] You have to in order to do that.
[00:45:25] You have to like raise your, you have to call a little bit of attention to yourself
[00:45:28] and raise your hand and say, hey, this is who I am.
[00:45:32] You have to take you, this is who I am.
[00:45:34] You have to actually have to step into the spotlight a little bit
[00:45:38] so that you can let people know who you are because if people don't know who you are,
[00:45:41] how do you have a relationship with him and if you don't have a relationship with people
[00:45:44] how can they trust you?
[00:45:46] So, so that's part of it.
[00:45:50] Right. That's part of what they're asking you to do.
[00:45:52] Now, in all seriousness, if you really don't want to do it,
[00:45:58] well then you can keep being the guy that's in the back and guess what?
[00:46:02] You're going to be mad in six months when some other chef gets hired
[00:46:06] for a different chef than all of a sudden he's out making friends with everyone.
[00:46:09] He gets promoted and why do you get promoted?
[00:46:12] Well, look at what the guy's doing.
[00:46:14] But he's not as good as, he's not as good as a cook as I am.
[00:46:19] Guess what? They don't really care.
[00:46:21] Being making the food is only part of what they want you to do.
[00:46:25] Just like being a seal, doing the doing missions is only part of what you need to do to do the mission.
[00:46:31] You can't just be tactically sound. You've got to have the relationship built
[00:46:34] so you can work in the battle space that's owned by a conventional commander.
[00:46:38] You've got to have the relationship that you can get your missions approved
[00:46:41] up the chain of command on the special operation side.
[00:46:44] How do you do that? You build.
[00:46:46] You go out. You talk to people. You get out of your comfort zone.
[00:46:50] So weird thing, you know, I'm kind of anti-social, right?
[00:46:57] Like, if you don't know me, we're not going to have a conversation.
[00:47:03] You know, like, we're not having a conversation.
[00:47:08] I'm not walking up and talking to you. If I don't know you, I'm not walking up and saying,
[00:47:11] hi to you. It's not happening. It's not my personality.
[00:47:14] If you say hi to me, I'll say hi. I'm not disrespectful.
[00:47:18] I'm not rude, but I'm not looking to have a bunch of conversations with people.
[00:47:23] And so that's known to me.
[00:47:26] But that's not okay for the business side of my life, which is, hey, I got to talk to people.
[00:47:32] I got to talk to people. I got to build relationships.
[00:47:34] I got to had to know my commanding officer.
[00:47:37] Had to know the commenter. Had to know the conventional
[00:47:42] Battalion commander. Had to know the brigade commander.
[00:47:44] Had to build relationships. Could I just talk about
[00:47:48] war with the brigade commander?
[00:47:52] Well, I could, but what's more powerful that I talk about war.
[00:47:56] And I talk about where I'm from or where he's from or what, you know,
[00:48:00] other things? Yes, because I want to build a relationship. Why?
[00:48:03] Because I'm trying to build trust. Why?
[00:48:05] Because I wanted to allow me to go out there and do things in his
[00:48:08] battle space.
[00:48:10] So that's what they're asking me. They're asking you to step out of your comfort zone.
[00:48:15] It doesn't need to become your primary focus. No.
[00:48:18] Should you try and step out of the comfort zone?
[00:48:20] If you want to grow, if you want to have more opportunity,
[00:48:23] I would give it a try.
[00:48:25] I would give it a try.
[00:48:27] If not, you know, like I said, if you hate it, and you feel like you're not being true to your true self,
[00:48:33] that's okay. Maybe your true self is meant to be the one that's back, not getting promoted.
[00:48:38] Yeah.
[00:48:39] They need somebody to do that.
[00:48:41] If it's not you, it might be somebody else.
[00:48:44] Yeah.
[00:48:45] So another one of those tough questions where people, you know, hit me with like,
[00:48:48] should I just be, should be loyal to myself.
[00:48:51] Because the obvious, like,
[00:48:54] I think the answer that everyone wants to hear is like, yeah, dude, most important thing is you've got to be loyal to yourself.
[00:48:58] That's the most important thing.
[00:48:59] Yeah.
[00:49:00] Okay.
[00:49:00] If that's what your priority is, then that's the most important thing.
[00:49:03] But guess what?
[00:49:05] Who does a who can take care of the other kitchen dogs that respect you so much?
[00:49:10] Who can take a better care of them than you can?
[00:49:13] Because if you get promoted, if you don't get promoted and and
[00:49:17] Johnny glamour boy gets promoted, because he likes to go out and
[00:49:22] push moves to the clients and now he gets promoted and yours.
[00:49:25] And now who's going to take care of the kitchen dogs on his, on his time, right?
[00:49:30] Not him.
[00:49:31] He doesn't care.
[00:49:32] He's got he got promoted, not for taking care of his guys.
[00:49:35] You got promoted because he smooths the clients.
[00:49:38] Yeah.
[00:49:39] And play the game a little bit.
[00:49:40] It's weird when you're explaining that and it's like,
[00:49:43] it makes complete sense.
[00:49:45] I'm thinking of it in terms of like being a, I don't know.
[00:49:48] I guess it applies to any relationship you have.
[00:49:51] Like let's say, okay, you have a wife, right?
[00:49:53] You're buried, whatever.
[00:49:55] And so your wife wants to go to hypothetically.
[00:50:01] Wife wants to go to ananovermott.
[00:50:03] You're like, I don't like vermott.
[00:50:05] You know, go to vermott.
[00:50:07] But you're wife say, hey, I want you to come because I like spending time with you and
[00:50:12] all this stuff.
[00:50:13] And as a husband, you're like, hey, I like spending time with you too.
[00:50:16] Why can't we do something that I specifically like to do?
[00:50:20] And it has to do so a lot of times with like maybe you're ice friends with the
[00:50:25] inlaw.
[00:50:26] So I don't want to hang with you, but I want to hang with them and the wife wants to hang with you
[00:50:29] with the friends and all this stuff or whatever.
[00:50:31] But a lot of the time, in my case, might have been me just sticking in my little comfort zone.
[00:50:38] You know, like the people that I like to hang out with, there's like set stuff that I know they're
[00:50:42] into and I know they like to talk about it and all this stuff.
[00:50:45] And I'm essentially rejecting being open to new or other stuff.
[00:50:52] You know, that's kind of like a situation.
[00:50:55] But in a way, I'm kind of doing what this, what this guy's implying where it's like,
[00:51:01] I'm going to say to myself, my interest and all this stuff, I love my wife 100%.
[00:51:05] That has nothing to do with it.
[00:51:06] Vermont has nothing to do with me and my wife, you know.
[00:51:09] But why shouldn't I step outside of my comfort zone?
[00:51:14] And, you know, try to accommodate her wishes in this way.
[00:51:18] It's not a maker breaker relationship enough like that.
[00:51:20] But if I do that, if I just exercise the ability to be open, I become more valuable of a husband,
[00:51:28] more valuable, I offer more value in the relationship and as a person.
[00:51:32] So, same exact thing when you're explaining this, when this guy's explaining where he's
[00:51:37] awesome in the as a chef in the back, doing the, you know, doing his deal, doing what he does best.
[00:51:43] So, but they, and this guy see it, he's gonna be very see it, obviously,
[00:51:47] where they're like, hey, we want you to do this more stuff even because you're awesome in men.
[00:51:51] Imagine if you had this, this more stuff, you know,
[00:51:54] a valuable you would be as a XYZ, whatever the position is in this case is a chef.
[00:51:59] And to reject that is essentially to say, you know what, I don't want to be more valuable as a chef.
[00:52:06] Or I don't want to be more valuable as a husband.
[00:52:09] I prefer to stick with my current value.
[00:52:13] I don't want to upgrade.
[00:52:15] There you go.
[00:52:16] I refuse to upgrade.
[00:52:18] Some stain.
[00:52:19] True to myself.
[00:52:21] Just saying.
[00:52:22] Anyway, next question.
[00:52:23] I mean, can you cross the line and get to a point where you make yourself sick?
[00:52:27] Because you've done, yeah, then you've gone too far.
[00:52:29] That's, you know, like, I got me a leadership, like, yeah, if you become just a,
[00:52:34] disgusting, sick event, then that's what?
[00:52:38] That's not good.
[00:52:39] Yeah.
[00:52:40] So I'm not talking about that.
[00:52:41] Yeah.
[00:52:42] I'm not talking about leaving your values and abandoning your values.
[00:52:45] That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:52:46] Right.
[00:52:47] Talking about playing the game a little bit.
[00:52:48] There's a big difference.
[00:52:49] Step up to the comfort zone.
[00:52:50] Yeah.
[00:52:51] Play the game a little bit.
[00:52:52] At the very least, do it with the open mind.
[00:52:54] See, I like it.
[00:52:55] What if you were like, you got real good at that?
[00:52:57] You know, like public speaking, for example, where I'm no exception.
[00:53:02] A lot of people don't like public speaking.
[00:53:05] Even though they might have a lot to say or whatever, you know, like some people like
[00:53:08] they're smart, but I don't want to get up on state and nothing like that.
[00:53:11] That's dumb.
[00:53:12] I'm not a star.
[00:53:13] I don't want to limelight on me and all this stuff.
[00:53:16] They do one time and they offer like just so much value doing it.
[00:53:20] And then they get used to it.
[00:53:21] Then all of a sudden they kind of like it.
[00:53:23] You know, it could be one of those deals.
[00:53:25] Could be.
[00:53:26] You never know.
[00:53:27] So you try it.
[00:53:29] Next question.
[00:53:31] Two of my bosses have told me I don't like Jocco.
[00:53:34] Interesting.
[00:53:35] Interesting.
[00:53:36] Got that.
[00:53:38] Without giving any valid reasons, their ego is in the way.
[00:53:43] How do I flank them to help them see the path?
[00:53:47] My belief is that they're afraid of the truth and they're afraid of the truth.
[00:53:53] They see an extreme ownership.
[00:53:55] Okay.
[00:53:56] So, yeah, I mean clearly, you go could be a problem here as a leader.
[00:53:59] You know, who wants to constantly be compared to some other leader?
[00:54:03] Right.
[00:54:04] You know, if you were teaching a Jocco, the way that the way that Dean teaches this, you know,
[00:54:08] that would make you mad after all.
[00:54:11] So that could be part of the problem.
[00:54:13] Oh, that's definitely.
[00:54:14] That's that's a way up there on the list of possible things.
[00:54:17] Could be the military flavor, right?
[00:54:19] Some people don't like the military flavor thing.
[00:54:21] So that's that's okay.
[00:54:23] It's.
[00:54:24] It's.
[00:54:25] It's.
[00:54:26] Can turn some people off.
[00:54:27] They don't want to hear about it.
[00:54:28] That's fine.
[00:54:29] The reality is.
[00:54:31] It's.
[00:54:32] It's.
[00:54:33] But here's the reality of the situation.
[00:54:35] Okay.
[00:54:36] What is there to not like about the things that I talk about, right?
[00:54:44] So let's say, you know what, I don't like people taking ownership.
[00:54:46] I want everyone to make excuses and play each other, right?
[00:54:49] It doesn't even make sense.
[00:54:51] You know, instead of, you know, I don't want to hear about this cover move.
[00:54:54] I want everyone to ignore each other and get more.
[00:54:56] You're about themselves, right?
[00:54:57] Like that that that makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:55:00] You know, if, if keeping things simple, I don't want to, hey, look, I don't want to keep things simple.
[00:55:04] I want everything to be so complicated.
[00:55:05] But no one knows what's going on, right?
[00:55:07] Like, look, these things that they make note, there's no human being.
[00:55:11] No one in a leadership position.
[00:55:13] That would want everyone or that would that would go against what these simple principles.
[00:55:20] So.
[00:55:23] How do you fix it then, right?
[00:55:25] What's the problem?
[00:55:27] Well, one, here's a couple, and actually this was a Twitter thing.
[00:55:30] And a bunch of people gave great responses on Twitter after I kind of highlighted it.
[00:55:35] One, one of them, and my, my actual responses like, hey, just don't, you know, stop using my name.
[00:55:41] You know, stop saying, well, joculous it because you can imagine how I'm knowing that much.
[00:55:45] Oh, well, joculous in, you know, when you're in a leadership position, you know, it's like.
[00:55:48] That's going to really great on somebody.
[00:55:50] So, so, so throw that out the window.
[00:55:52] Don't pit it as me, jocco against what your boss is saying, no, don't do that.
[00:55:58] You've set up an adversarial relationship with them.
[00:56:01] And you've set up an adversarial relationship with me.
[00:56:03] And I've never even met these people before.
[00:56:05] I don't even know who they are even know what business they're in.
[00:56:08] But what you've done by constantly harping on it is you've pissed them off.
[00:56:12] And now they're saying, dude, quit talking about jocco.
[00:56:14] We don't care because also the way that he's, just the way he's being offensive in approaching these things.
[00:56:21] And watching these things means that he has a little more listening and growing to do.
[00:56:24] Because if you really want to approach your boss or, you know, he asked about flanking his boss.
[00:56:29] Well, the way you flank someone isn't going, hey, the way jocco is such you should do this.
[00:56:32] Like, no, that's not good.
[00:56:35] So let the principles work on another, another person pointed out, you know,
[00:56:41] Hey, don't, hey, stop trying to impose your things on them.
[00:56:46] Like, just take extreme ownership.
[00:56:48] That's how you step up and start leading. You do your thing. You perform well.
[00:56:52] Quit talking, quit trying to force these things down people's throat and give them space.
[00:56:56] Give them room.
[00:56:57] And then they'll recognize that you're doing a good job.
[00:57:02] If you label it with something that you know, they don't like.
[00:57:06] Well, then they're not going to like it. No matter what you do, no matter what you do.
[00:57:10] That's going to be problematic.
[00:57:12] Don't beludge them with with, well, you know, I, this is blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:17] No, don't do that.
[00:57:19] Take, let, but you're ego in check. How's that sound?
[00:57:22] Put your ego in check a little bit.
[00:57:24] Make the ideas that you're talking about, their ideas.
[00:57:28] Get them to talk about ownership.
[00:57:30] You know, get them, maybe they call it something else.
[00:57:33] Other than extreme ownership.
[00:57:34] Maybe they call it, you know, personal accountability.
[00:57:37] Okay, awesome. That's a great, yeah. I really like that.
[00:57:40] I really like what you've come up with, boss. I'm in with that.
[00:57:42] Oh, well, now they're in the game.
[00:57:44] And they don't realize that you're talking about the same thing.
[00:57:47] That's fine.
[00:57:48] Don't, they don't ever have to realize that.
[00:57:49] They don't ever have to realize that.
[00:57:52] So, I mean, there's some people, there's some people that don't like,
[00:57:55] even in the teams, there's people that like, they didn't like me.
[00:57:58] Didn't matter, didn't matter where what the, the principle was,
[00:58:02] didn't make, oh, that's the law.
[00:58:04] It's like, no.
[00:58:06] Like, hey, just, just don't, don't attach my name to it.
[00:58:11] Yeah. And go and do, be a good leader. How's that?
[00:58:14] So, those are some things.
[00:58:16] I think if you live, live the principles, act on the principles,
[00:58:20] no one's going to be mad at you for taking ownership
[00:58:23] and responsibility of what you're doing.
[00:58:25] Unless you say, oh, you look how I took ownership of that.
[00:58:27] Well, then you might paint yourself into a corner with it.
[00:58:30] They weren't stupid.
[00:58:31] Or they end up not accepting what you're doing.
[00:58:34] Yeah.
[00:58:35] And they'll get mad at you for stepping on their toes, of course.
[00:58:37] And it is also, as you do this, as you take ownership,
[00:58:40] don't rub their noses in it.
[00:58:42] You give them credit. How hard is that?
[00:58:44] You know, you've come up with a pro solution to problem,
[00:58:46] say, hey, no, actually, I got this idea from something like,
[00:58:48] oh, you do it.
[00:58:49] Really?
[00:58:50] Right?
[00:58:51] That's how you, that's how you flank them.
[00:58:53] Hey, it took ownership of this problem.
[00:58:55] Oh, really?
[00:58:56] Oh, you took all the, you're a ghost streamer.
[00:58:57] You know, I don't want to say that.
[00:59:11] Don't say that.
[00:59:13] You know, it's a K-Boss.
[00:59:15] I wanted to make sure this got done correctly.
[00:59:17] I was watching the way you did.
[00:59:19] Dobba, bo, bo, bo, bo.
[00:59:20] You go from there.
[00:59:21] Yeah.
[00:59:22] Give them the idea.
[00:59:23] You know, makes sense.
[00:59:25] is multiple repetitions of what you guys say.
[00:59:29] Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:30] And didn't pick up the vibe, which is like, hey, I'm dealing with someone
[00:59:34] with a big ego and they're not going to take well to me talking about this
[00:59:37] other guys leadership style.
[00:59:39] Do you, you don't want to be compared to some other leader if you're in
[00:59:41] leadership position?
[00:59:42] Yeah.
[00:59:43] And I'm also, this kind of the same thing, but a little bit different.
[00:59:47] The, that thinking about that type of scenario, man, that's the worst.
[00:59:52] That's like as a boss, I would think that that'd be really bad.
[00:59:56] Because okay, so here's his situation.
[00:59:58] So I make videos sometimes.
[01:00:01] Right.
[01:00:02] And so let's say I am, and actually this is an actual thing that actually
[01:00:06] happened where, okay, so I'm in this video for this, we'll say client.
[01:00:10] And, classic, okay, you know, they look at it and it's typical, you know, they'll have
[01:00:14] some input, maybe some information they want to add or take or change or whatever.
[01:00:18] And then this guy said, oh yeah, I'm not sure about this part.
[01:00:24] I showed it to my wife and she said, you know, XYZ and XYZ and I'm thinking, okay, I get it,
[01:00:32] like okay, you showed it to people that understand, but I was like, wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:35] So this is a video I made for you and your deal, you know, kind of thing.
[01:00:40] And you went and showed your wife and then now she has some kind of input.
[01:00:43] She's not part of this deal, you know?
[01:00:45] And now you're like sighting your wife's critique and like all this stuff.
[01:00:49] And it does make sense by the way, as far as what we've discussed and all this stuff, right?
[01:00:53] So the wife is kind of now I kind of have this kind of disdain for the wife.
[01:00:56] I don't know the wife at all, by the way.
[01:00:58] So I'm like, I'm just not feeling the wife anymore.
[01:01:00] You go got the way.
[01:01:01] You know, you're a little bit in it and it's natural is what I'm saying where it's kind
[01:01:05] of like, I thought we were doing this video kind of together and I'll do this for you
[01:01:09] and you give me the input and we're not, you involved your wife in it who threw the whole
[01:01:12] thing off because she's not even part of this little thing.
[01:01:13] Right.
[01:01:14] It's really hard to put your ego in check.
[01:01:16] It's really hard to put your ego in check and actually listen to what the critique points
[01:01:20] are.
[01:01:21] It's hard for anyone to do that.
[01:01:24] And so when it happens, you have to go, okay, that's my ego and you need to put it
[01:01:29] aside.
[01:01:30] Yeah.
[01:01:31] So consider this situation.
[01:01:33] If the guy would have just said, don't say I showed it to my wife and she said this.
[01:01:38] Don't say if he would have said, well, I was thinking about this, which is what the wife
[01:01:42] said, you know, in that whatever.
[01:01:44] I was thinking about this, whether it would have got delivered way better, way easier,
[01:01:48] same thing with your situation if someone's saying, I don't know, let's say, for example,
[01:01:53] it's a fireman, it's a fireman.
[01:01:56] And you know, the boss is saying, hey, we should do this and do that and then this guy
[01:01:59] just, I'll be saying, well, Jocco said, boss is like, who the hell is Jocco?
[01:02:03] I don't remember hiring Jocco, who is this guy?
[01:02:06] And what's he talking about cool, but Jocco has no saying this department.
[01:02:10] It's me and it's you, it's the team, you know, the team that we've worked with kind of
[01:02:14] thing and that's kind of the feeling.
[01:02:16] So yeah, I'm in.
[01:02:17] Don't say Jocco.
[01:02:18] Yeah, I don't need to credit.
[01:02:21] Not all.
[01:02:22] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:25] Next question, Jocco, please explain how working harder for an incompetent superior
[01:02:29] helps oneself.
[01:02:31] I feel like screw them in whatever lightning bolt of luck they were struck by it again in
[01:02:35] their position.
[01:02:36] That kind of like screw them in the horse they rode in.
[01:02:40] Yeah, that is.
[01:02:41] No, he's saying screw them in.
[01:02:42] They're, they're in their position of superior because they got lucky.
[01:02:45] Yeah, yeah, I didn't get lucky.
[01:02:46] Well, that's true.
[01:02:47] Yeah.
[01:02:48] And, you know, here's the answer that is like, okay, so what do you can do then?
[01:02:51] Yeah.
[01:02:52] Okay, what do you can do then?
[01:02:54] You're going to sit around and wait for your own bolt of lightning of luck to hit you.
[01:02:59] Is that what you're going to do?
[01:03:01] I don't recommend that.
[01:03:02] Instead, I recommend that you step up and yes, you do work harder.
[01:03:06] And you do the best possible job that you can do and you take some pride in what you're
[01:03:11] doing and how you're doing it.
[01:03:13] And you do it better than they could not to rub their nose into it, not to prove that you
[01:03:18] can do a better, but out of professionalism.
[01:03:23] That's why you do it.
[01:03:24] Now, one outcome that can come from that is they get credit for your work and that makes
[01:03:30] you all mad.
[01:03:31] No, that's actually good because if they get credit for your work, that's what works going
[01:03:35] well, they're going to get promoted.
[01:03:37] And they get the recognition.
[01:03:39] Okay, that's fine.
[01:03:43] But they know where the actual credit goes, even if they don't give it to you, even if
[01:03:49] they don't give it to you, they know it, even if they have a person who doesn't even realize
[01:03:54] that you're like, oh, wow, I did all that work and he's taken all the credit for.
[01:03:58] They don't even know that I made this happen or he doesn't even know that he's that I made
[01:04:01] this happen.
[01:04:02] No, they know.
[01:04:06] So as long as you can keep your ego in check and you can let them have the credit eventually,
[01:04:12] they get promoted.
[01:04:13] The team's doing well.
[01:04:14] You'll look good.
[01:04:15] You'll get promoted.
[01:04:16] Your life is easy.
[01:04:18] Your gaining experience.
[01:04:19] You've got a good reputation.
[01:04:20] Everything is going in your direction.
[01:04:24] And by the way, when that incompetent person does get promoted, who do they usually recommend
[01:04:29] that fills their spot?
[01:04:30] You, because you're the one that got them promoted.
[01:04:32] They're stoked on that.
[01:04:34] Now you become a superstar.
[01:04:37] That's great.
[01:04:38] Eventually they're going to get found out by the way.
[01:04:40] Someone incompetency can't be hidden forever.
[01:04:43] And eventually someone says, wait a second, you didn't even know how to do this.
[01:04:45] That was echo Charles.
[01:04:46] That was doing this this whole time.
[01:04:48] Yeah?
[01:04:49] Okay.
[01:04:50] Okay, well, we're going to promote echo.
[01:04:51] You're out of here.
[01:04:53] That'll happen.
[01:04:55] And when that happens, when that incompetency gets found out, then you will get the recognition
[01:05:00] you deserve, because people said, I don't know, that wasn't Jocco doing all this stuff.
[01:05:03] This was echo.
[01:05:04] There you go.
[01:05:05] Oh, Jocco, you're done.
[01:05:06] So that's something to happen.
[01:05:08] Or another outcome that can happen is that they give you the credit that you're
[01:05:12] due, which is great.
[01:05:14] And you still get promoted.
[01:05:15] And you may get promoted above them, which is fine, too.
[01:05:19] And, or they might get promoted, which is fine, stop worrying about it.
[01:05:24] So those two things, if you do a good job, eventually something good is going to come out
[01:05:28] of it.
[01:05:29] They get whether it's you both get promoted, whether it's they get promoted above you, whether
[01:05:32] it's you get promoted above them.
[01:05:33] It doesn't matter.
[01:05:34] All those outcomes, or maybe it's just the team continues to do well.
[01:05:37] And your job is stress free and you continue to perform.
[01:05:40] And the division that you're in grows and you get a chance to promote, because everyone's
[01:05:45] getting promoted, it's like, oh, good.
[01:05:47] All good stuff.
[01:05:49] Or you can be angry and you can be frustrated and you can blame your own bad luck and
[01:05:53] you can not work hard and you can not do a good job and you can be recognized as a slacker
[01:05:56] or you can get blamed by the incompetent boss when things do fall short.
[01:06:01] Because that's what the incompetent boss does.
[01:06:03] He doesn't step up and say, go ownership of it.
[01:06:05] He says, no, you know what?
[01:06:06] I would have done a better job, but Echo was slacking.
[01:06:09] That's the problem.
[01:06:10] Now Echo gets fired.
[01:06:13] And guess what?
[01:06:14] Someone, we hire someone else to come in and they start doing a good job.
[01:06:16] The boss is still going to look good and still get promoted, just that you lost your
[01:06:20] job.
[01:06:21] And by the way, you lost your job with a bad reputation.
[01:06:22] Now you can't even get a recommendation for a new job.
[01:06:26] Where you lose?
[01:06:29] That's what's going to happen.
[01:06:31] So step up, do your best.
[01:06:33] It'll pay off in the long run.
[01:06:36] Yeah.
[01:06:37] It's funny how like it's one of those things where if you can just flip the switch and
[01:06:40] see that, just that one, you think?
[01:06:41] And it's funny though, too, the way those questions are framed, you know, what they
[01:06:46] want to hear is like, no, you know, what if you got an incompetent boss, you don't help
[01:06:50] them out, you've got a bird.
[01:06:52] Yeah.
[01:06:53] That's what you do.
[01:06:54] That's what people want to hear.
[01:06:55] But it's the easy answer and it's not the smart answer.
[01:06:58] And it's a short term answer, not a long term answer.
[01:07:01] Make your boss look great.
[01:07:02] How's that?
[01:07:03] That's my goal.
[01:07:04] I want to make my boss look great.
[01:07:06] There was a little tell in the question too.
[01:07:11] I'm no expert.
[01:07:12] Obviously, but I'm like, both of luck.
[01:07:14] Yeah.
[01:07:15] So you know the whole deal.
[01:07:16] And this is even, you can be a person who recognize this.
[01:07:19] Like people who are bitter, I'm not saying the asker of this question is bad.
[01:07:23] I'm not saying that.
[01:07:24] I'm saying this is an external scenario.
[01:07:27] But you know, if you get a bitter person who's just being in life, maybe not doing it
[01:07:32] as well in life as they had, you know, had hoped or whatever, you'll probably realize
[01:07:37] you'll probably encounter them from time to time.
[01:07:40] No more.
[01:07:41] Saying how the guy who is successful is lucky.
[01:07:45] They're lucky.
[01:07:46] They had a given to them, like all this, all this other stuff.
[01:07:50] Me, I'm not lucky with whatever.
[01:07:52] But it's always the successful guy.
[01:07:54] It's lucky.
[01:07:55] Always.
[01:07:56] Yeah, they attribute other people's success to luck.
[01:07:58] So they're lightning bolt of luck and screw them, you know, kind of thing.
[01:08:03] Just that is indicative.
[01:08:04] I'm not saying it is.
[01:08:05] I'm not saying it is or isn't as far as this particular person.
[01:08:08] But it tends to be like that.
[01:08:10] And again, like that, just that switch.
[01:08:12] If you can turn on the switch and just look at it, just like how you said, it's not intuitive.
[01:08:16] I get it, man.
[01:08:17] Because it's like, I was in that situation where like literally I was doing the work.
[01:08:22] So many think about this.
[01:08:23] You just said you're in this situation.
[01:08:26] Almost everybody has been in this situation.
[01:08:28] And here's the difference.
[01:08:30] If you don't flip that switch and you're in this situation, your whole life goes down
[01:08:35] in the other direction.
[01:08:36] Yeah.
[01:08:37] That's the real problem.
[01:08:38] That's why you meet people.
[01:08:39] You know, this is a thing I think about a lot.
[01:08:41] You know how you know people in your life, their bad asses.
[01:08:45] But they, but they're not going anywhere.
[01:08:48] Like you look at it and you go, man, this kind of smarter than me.
[01:08:52] And a better athlete than me and a better speaker than me.
[01:08:57] But they're not going anywhere.
[01:08:59] And you know why it's because at some point in their life instead of saying, oh, wow, that
[01:09:03] guy's lucky.
[01:09:04] That's what they do.
[01:09:06] At some point in their life instead of saying, hey, that person worked to get in that
[01:09:10] situation and I should do the same.
[01:09:12] Is that a saying that?
[01:09:13] They say, oh, that person got lucky.
[01:09:15] Yeah.
[01:09:16] That's why they're there.
[01:09:17] And I'm down here.
[01:09:18] Yeah.
[01:09:19] You better make them.
[01:09:20] Yeah, you can't make the upward climb.
[01:09:21] If you don't say, you know what, hey, that person might be a little luck there.
[01:09:25] But guess what, they're obviously working hard.
[01:09:27] They're obviously doing something right because I'm down here and they're up there.
[01:09:29] How do I get up there?
[01:09:31] Yeah.
[01:09:32] The answer to get up there is not by tearing them down.
[01:09:35] The answer to get up there is by working hard.
[01:09:38] Make them look good.
[01:09:39] That line you said, so what?
[01:09:44] And so what are you going to do about it?
[01:09:46] Yeah, what are you going to do about it?
[01:09:47] That's the switch right there.
[01:09:48] Because I mean, you do with it with kids.
[01:09:50] I've seen some young kids and, you know, same thing like, oh, this is what it is or this
[01:09:55] happened or whatever spilled milk out of no whatever.
[01:09:59] And, you know, the kids crying.
[01:10:00] That's all this stuff.
[01:10:01] It's like, okay.
[01:10:02] So what are you going to do about it?
[01:10:04] So you can cry.
[01:10:05] You totally can.
[01:10:07] And you can complain about how junk that is that the milk, that spill to your toy
[01:10:11] broker, whatever the situation.
[01:10:12] Yeah, because that's all truth.
[01:10:14] Absolutely true.
[01:10:15] And good.
[01:10:16] You can cry whatever.
[01:10:17] You're going to do about it.
[01:10:18] Then, okay, then that's what it's going to be.
[01:10:19] And that's all it's going to be.
[01:10:20] You're going to continue to cry.
[01:10:22] And you're probably going to continue to cry next time it happens to or you clean up the milk,
[01:10:26] you fix your toy, whatever, you know, whatever.
[01:10:28] What are you going to do about it?
[01:10:29] That's the whole thing, you know?
[01:10:31] What are you going to do about it?
[01:10:32] It's interesting to you.
[01:10:33] There's like a just a known, the right answer seems really obvious when we talk about it
[01:10:40] right now.
[01:10:41] But not many people see that right answer.
[01:10:42] No.
[01:10:43] Most people want to just be mad at their boss and be frustrated and undermine them.
[01:10:47] And not work hard so that they don't get any shine on them.
[01:10:50] So, okay, great.
[01:10:51] That's you putting yourself on that barrel, too.
[01:10:53] Don't do it.
[01:10:54] Just crazy.
[01:10:55] Yeah.
[01:10:56] It's good.
[01:10:57] Actuation say it's crazy.
[01:10:58] It's, it makes sense.
[01:10:59] I mean, I felt that before.
[01:11:02] 100%.
[01:11:03] Yeah.
[01:11:04] Oh, for sure.
[01:11:05] For sure.
[01:11:06] Next question.
[01:11:07] Can you be default aggressive and relaxed in jujitsu?
[01:11:13] Okay.
[01:11:14] Yeah.
[01:11:15] Yeah, this seems like two opposing things that you can't do at the same time, but the
[01:11:19] actual fact is yes, you can and you should.
[01:11:22] So you want your maneuvers to be aggressive, but you don't want to be using a bunch
[01:11:26] of strength to execute the maneuvers, right?
[01:11:29] You want to aggressively escape your opponent's position before your opponent gets settled.
[01:11:36] Therefore, you don't have to use strength.
[01:11:39] You can use relax it.
[01:11:40] You can relax.
[01:11:41] And you can be proactive, same thing with defending a submission attempt.
[01:11:45] You want to defend that submission attempt aggressively before this submission attempt gets
[01:11:52] settled in.
[01:11:54] You want to move aggressively.
[01:11:57] Again, I'm not talking about strength and spashing.
[01:12:00] I'm talking about moving aggressively before your opponent moves and get ahead of them on
[01:12:05] their U-loop.
[01:12:06] When you get ahead of them on their U-loop, they're going to have issues with you.
[01:12:10] And so yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:13] You can be default aggressive and at the same time you can be relaxed and you should
[01:12:16] that should be your goal.
[01:12:18] Do you sometimes have to use strength in Gjitsu?
[01:12:20] Yes, you do.
[01:12:22] Yes, you do.
[01:12:23] Sometimes you've got to power out of something.
[01:12:25] Why did the reason you had to power out of something is because you were too late because
[01:12:29] you weren't moving aggressively enough.
[01:12:32] You weren't moving quickly enough.
[01:12:33] Because then you got to power out of something and claw those hands, claw that guillotine off
[01:12:38] your neck.
[01:12:39] Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:12:40] You're telling someone they're clawing your fingers away from their neck?
[01:12:43] Yes.
[01:12:44] So when that happens, that person was late.
[01:12:47] And now they're clawing the resorting to strength and resorting to panic, clawing
[01:12:52] at your fingers.
[01:12:53] So no, usually it doesn't even matter.
[01:12:55] They can claw.
[01:12:56] It doesn't matter.
[01:12:57] Good.
[01:12:58] No.
[01:12:59] I like that sense of panic.
[01:13:00] But I feel when they're clawing.
[01:13:02] Yeah, I'm sure you do.
[01:13:03] You really seem like you like it a lot.
[01:13:06] So that's what it is.
[01:13:07] And by the way, this is true in life as well.
[01:13:09] You do like if you are maneuvering correctly, correctly as a leader, you don't have to
[01:13:18] get aggressive at people because they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.
[01:13:24] You don't have to be.
[01:13:25] You shouldn't have to yell.
[01:13:26] If you have to yell as a boss, guess what?
[01:13:28] Your intent wasn't followed.
[01:13:30] Your plan wasn't understood.
[01:13:31] There's so many mistakes that you made if you're yelling as a leader.
[01:13:34] Do you never have to yell?
[01:13:35] Yeah, certainly, sometimes you can yell because you got to make sure you get that emotional
[01:13:37] point across sometimes, you got to make sure that someone really likes someone doesn't seem
[01:13:40] to realize that they may just severe enough that they're warned to yelling and therefore
[01:13:43] it doesn't matter to them because they're dad yelling in their whole life.
[01:13:46] So if you're not yelling, they don't get it.
[01:13:48] So can you can you run to that?
[01:13:50] Problem occasionally.
[01:13:51] Occasionally, very occasionally.
[01:13:53] Very rarely should you run into that situation because if you're doing the right job being
[01:13:58] default, aggressive as a leader, you should be in situations where you never have to yell
[01:14:04] because your people understand what it is that they're supposed to be doing.
[01:14:09] They understand why they're supposed to be doing it.
[01:14:11] They understand what the plan is.
[01:14:13] They understand what the contingencies were.
[01:14:14] They understand what the intent that you had was.
[01:14:18] They understand this way that this fits strategically into the situation.
[01:14:22] They understand all those things and if they understand all those things, then they're
[01:14:25] going to do the right thing.
[01:14:26] And if they don't, if they understand all those things and they still do something that doesn't
[01:14:30] make sense, well, maybe they do deserve to yell that.
[01:14:33] But again, all the first person I check is myself.
[01:14:36] And say, well, obviously, I'd make this clear enough.
[01:14:40] So yes, relax harder.
[01:14:44] So yelling is to leading as using strength is to do you get to.
[01:14:50] So what?
[01:14:51] You gotta do it everyone.
[01:14:52] So if you lay, maybe you lacked on your technique earlier, you gotta make a little
[01:14:58] end.
[01:14:59] But think about this.
[01:15:01] You hurt your stamina.
[01:15:02] Yeah, you're straight.
[01:15:04] And with your little piece of stuff.
[01:15:05] When I yell at you, because something went wrong and you're my subordinate, when
[01:15:08] I yell at you, I pay a little price for that, too.
[01:15:11] Because it better be important.
[01:15:14] And I better really think about it, because I didn't do anything to build our relationship
[01:15:17] and a positive manner by yelling at you.
[01:15:19] Didn't do anything.
[01:15:21] Just like you didn't improve your G2 technique or knowledge.
[01:15:25] Or really, I guess you improved your situation for a moment, right?
[01:15:29] Because you escaped.
[01:15:30] But now you're more tired.
[01:15:31] If I yell that you to do something and you did it, because you were like, okay, well, fine.
[01:15:36] I don't want to yell that anymore.
[01:15:37] So I'm just going to do this thing that you don't want to do.
[01:15:39] That's temporary fix.
[01:15:41] It's temporary fix.
[01:15:42] It's temporary fix.
[01:15:44] Yeah, you know how like JPL say, aggressive.
[01:15:47] Is it, or default aggressive?
[01:15:49] Is it towards people?
[01:15:50] It's towards making things happen.
[01:15:52] So like, so did you just the same thing?
[01:15:54] So it's like, I don't aggressively.
[01:15:56] Like, it's in a way.
[01:15:58] You kind of can narrow it down to the timing thing.
[01:16:00] It's like it's like it's either taking action or hesitating kind of thing.
[01:16:04] So you just don't really hesitate.
[01:16:05] You can lay back if that's part of the strategy and stuff like that.
[01:16:08] You can relax once part of the strategy.
[01:16:10] But it's about making things happen.
[01:16:11] Like, what are you trying to make things happen?
[01:16:12] Timing wise.
[01:16:13] So you know how like you have the thing to embarrass us.
[01:16:15] What is the disrespect?
[01:16:17] Remember you asked me that?
[01:16:18] What's the disrespect?
[01:16:19] Oh, it's the G2.
[01:16:21] Yeah, go pass.
[01:16:22] You're a G.
[01:16:23] They you made up, but you made up the terminology as well.
[01:16:27] So the disrespect is basically, when a guy pulls guard or you're in a guard scenario,
[01:16:32] it's actually not even a guard scenario yet.
[01:16:35] It's like you essentially treat that person like they don't even have a guard.
[01:16:39] Like the guard doesn't even exist.
[01:16:41] That's how little respect you have for the guard in then you just pass.
[01:16:43] But when you kind of think about it when I think about it when you've done it to me the
[01:16:47] times you have, it is literally that.
[01:16:51] So before I can establish any kind of position to establish guard, you're just, yeah,
[01:16:56] you're a pass it, you're done, you don't even consider the guard.
[01:16:59] You know what's weird is, is where people get confused on this though, is they think,
[01:17:03] oh, so you're saying move faster.
[01:17:05] Yeah, right?
[01:17:06] That's the weird thing.
[01:17:07] Yeah, it is.
[01:17:09] It's not, I'm sure I'll think of this at a later time, but it's not about moving faster.
[01:17:16] Yes.
[01:17:17] It's about moving more aggressively.
[01:17:18] Yeah, it's not faster.
[01:17:19] It's like being proactive and being aggressive and shutting down the situation before
[01:17:24] or even becomes the situation that you know what's going to become.
[01:17:27] Yeah, so if you take, like you said, like if you take a take in action and hesitation
[01:17:32] you take those two, it's basically you're narrowing the hesitation down to zero.
[01:17:36] It's possible.
[01:17:37] That's literally what it is.
[01:17:38] Yeah, just take action.
[01:17:39] And again, you can relax, you can wait, but it's not hesitation waiting.
[01:17:44] It's waiting, it's like more like being patient or waiting for a very specific reason.
[01:17:48] You can do all those things, but there's no hesitation.
[01:17:51] That's what I think that is.
[01:17:53] And then obviously it's going to vary from the system.
[01:17:55] Yeah, this is something you hear over and over and over again in combat leadership philosophies.
[01:18:00] Like doing something now is better than waiting.
[01:18:03] Doing something, doing something that's pretty good right now is infinitely better than doing
[01:18:08] something that's great in two days.
[01:18:10] Yeah, good when better than a great thing.
[01:18:13] It's like the aggressive makes something happen.
[01:18:14] Like that is so important.
[01:18:17] Can you overdo it?
[01:18:18] Yes, you can.
[01:18:19] Can you make stupid decisions?
[01:18:20] Because you rushed, yes, you can.
[01:18:22] Is there a dichotomy in this?
[01:18:23] Absolutely, there is.
[01:18:25] That's, there's a dichotomy in every part of it.
[01:18:27] So in every type of leadership, there's a dichotomy in Getsu, right?
[01:18:31] There's a dichotomy because if I just rushed to a situation, well, that might be the
[01:18:35] situation that you want to be to rushed to.
[01:18:37] You gave me the opening, the trap.
[01:18:39] Yeah, the trap.
[01:18:41] So it's like, you know, when you're helping your friend move and then you get like three
[01:18:44] four other friends, you know, and everyone's waiting around to be like, okay, where do
[01:18:50] we start?
[01:18:51] Okay, where do we put, you know, where do we start?
[01:18:52] Who's starting first kind of thing?
[01:18:54] The default aggressive guy is just going to start moving stuff.
[01:18:57] Yeah.
[01:18:58] And that seemed like, okay, that's like a little lighthearted scenario, but that's
[01:19:01] real.
[01:19:02] That's what I would run into it.
[01:19:03] You know, when there's a bunch of people and we're all capable of making the decision,
[01:19:06] it kind of paralyzes everyone because this is so true.
[01:19:10] That scenario that you're talking about, it happens over and over and over again in the business
[01:19:13] world.
[01:19:14] It happens over and over again on the battlefield.
[01:19:15] It happens on the training field where there's a bunch of people in no one's
[01:19:19] taking leadership decision.
[01:19:20] Yeah, like you're all it takes is someone to say, hey, we're moving this over
[01:19:24] here.
[01:19:25] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:26] They put all this to get all the stuff off the truck right now.
[01:19:27] Boom.
[01:19:28] Yeah, guys are like, okay, cool, we'll make it happen.
[01:19:29] Yeah, like your oil rig scenario of the main one.
[01:19:32] The exact same thing.
[01:19:33] Yeah.
[01:19:34] And if you're default aggressive, meaning that's your default.
[01:19:40] That's your zero.
[01:19:41] You're that 100% then you're just pandiling business.
[01:19:45] Right.
[01:19:46] Your whole life until you take it too far.
[01:19:48] Yeah, and you're trying to run stuff that other people might have a better vision of
[01:19:51] what to do.
[01:19:52] Like if I might be, I found moldy moving for the first time ever on our moving team.
[01:19:58] And I come in and I'm like, hey, guess what, hey, we're going to start getting this
[01:20:00] to heavy stuff.
[01:20:01] And you're like, hey, actually, that's not a good idea.
[01:20:04] We should do this.
[01:20:05] We should get this stuff in here in the truck first or whatever, right?
[01:20:07] Because you've been doing it longer.
[01:20:09] So even though it's got to be your default mode, again, there's a dichotomy you can
[01:20:12] push it too far.
[01:20:13] Put a keypire.
[01:20:14] I'm so open.
[01:20:15] That's a question.
[01:20:16] More.
[01:20:18] Jocco.
[01:20:21] How do self-awareness, self-assessment, and self-improvement begin and how do they continue
[01:20:29] over time?
[01:20:31] Well, they're all tied together.
[01:20:36] And it starts with being self-aware, with being able to detach.
[01:20:45] Because if you can't attach from yourself, then you can't see yourself.
[01:20:53] And so people ask, how do you detach from yourself?
[01:20:58] How do you learn to do that?
[01:20:59] And a good drill for this is try to imagine the way other people see you.
[01:21:06] And what other people are thinking of you?
[01:21:12] And one place where this happens and it definitely happens to me is when I started getting
[01:21:18] putting charge of things, I started thinking about other people's perspectives.
[01:21:23] What do they see?
[01:21:26] If you're in charge, then what are your subordinates?
[01:21:30] See you do.
[01:21:31] What are your subordinates?
[01:21:32] Are you saying what kind of representation are they receiving?
[01:21:42] And if you work for someone else, it's the same questions.
[01:21:46] What does the boss see me do?
[01:21:48] What does the boss hear me say?
[01:21:51] What kind of representation am I making of myself to my boss?
[01:21:58] And then you start thinking about what are your friends and family think?
[01:22:03] What do they see?
[01:22:06] What do they hear?
[01:22:09] And so the question becomes how well do you represent yourself?
[01:22:14] What shortfalls do you have?
[01:22:17] Now, when you first start looking, it's like you're looking at an overgrown lawn.
[01:22:26] There are some big obvious problems.
[01:22:29] So you do a broad, just kind of general cut of the grass.
[01:22:34] You fix some of the big easy problems that are obvious.
[01:22:39] I want you to done that.
[01:22:42] I want you to have gotten rid of some of those big obvious problems.
[01:22:46] You notice some more detailed problems.
[01:22:49] So you then you handle them.
[01:22:50] And once you've got those handled, you see even smaller and more detailed issues.
[01:22:55] So you start trying to fix them.
[01:23:00] And that's what you do with yourself.
[01:23:03] You continually detach and then you look and then you refine and then you detach and then
[01:23:10] you look and then you refine and then you detach and then you look and then you refine.
[01:23:16] That's what you do.
[01:23:20] That's how you get better.
[01:23:22] And that process doesn't stop.
[01:23:25] It can't stop because if you stop refining, then the weeds grow back and the next thing
[01:23:35] you know, you can't see yourself anymore.
[01:23:38] And when you can't see yourself anymore, when you stop looking at yourself, then you accept
[01:23:50] anything.
[01:23:53] And that's wrong.
[01:23:57] Don't accept the faults.
[01:23:59] Don't give yourself the benefit of the doubt.
[01:24:02] You've got to be your own harshest critic.
[01:24:10] And hold the line and don't let go.
[01:24:22] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:24:28] So echo Charles, if speaking of improving ourselves, should we have any recommendations
[01:24:38] as to how we might be able to improve ourselves a little bit?
[01:24:41] Sure, improve and maintain.
[01:24:45] Improve maintain, improve maintain.
[01:24:46] Well, something like that.
[01:24:50] I would recommend.
[01:24:51] Okay, let's start with the workout.
[01:24:53] Work it out is established and known.
[01:24:58] Well known.
[01:24:59] By the way, to be one of the only things that you can do that all the fact every other
[01:25:03] part of your life in a good way.
[01:25:06] So also one of those things that will more health.
[01:25:09] If you lose that, you lose everything.
[01:25:10] It's one of those things.
[01:25:13] So why do some of us not regard it in that way?
[01:25:17] 100% of the time.
[01:25:19] Why do people not have time to exercise?
[01:25:22] Lack of discipline.
[01:25:24] Yeah.
[01:25:25] Possibly.
[01:25:26] It might be that short term payoff thing.
[01:25:29] You know, it's natural to seek short term payoff.
[01:25:31] It's natural.
[01:25:32] Think that's it.
[01:25:33] Because again, you lose your health, you lose everything straight up.
[01:25:38] So why wouldn't it be first in the priority list?
[01:25:41] I don't have time to exercise.
[01:25:43] No, you have time to exercise.
[01:25:44] You might not have time to rest to the stuff in life.
[01:25:48] Really?
[01:25:49] That's how it should be.
[01:25:50] Right?
[01:25:51] Nonetheless, when you're exercising, you join some like, do you generate?
[01:25:55] But don't worry about that, even.
[01:25:57] Because chocolate supplements, chocolate supplements.
[01:26:00] Go super-crile oil. This will make it three for your joints for a lot of other stuff
[01:26:04] too, by the way.
[01:26:05] Brain.
[01:26:06] Skin.
[01:26:07] Skin tone.
[01:26:08] That's like a supplemental thing.
[01:26:10] But it is good for it nonetheless.
[01:26:11] That's a fact.
[01:26:12] And another one called jacquil joint warfare.
[01:26:14] So your joints, when you start to lose the functionality of your joints, not only
[01:26:20] does it make workouts less desirable, less fun, effective, less fun, less everything.
[01:26:29] It can jam up your health.
[01:26:33] Physically, you can be less capable.
[01:26:34] So you want to maintain your joints.
[01:26:35] I didn't know this, but now that I do, I'm never looking back.
[01:26:39] Jacquil super-crile, take that and join warfare, maintain the joints.
[01:26:42] Maintain the joint health.
[01:26:44] Everything will be there.
[01:26:46] Get the subscription so you don't run out.
[01:26:47] That's what I say.
[01:26:48] Straight up.
[01:26:49] There's a panic mode if you run out.
[01:26:51] Yeah, and you don't want that panic mode.
[01:26:53] You don't even need that panic mode.
[01:26:54] You don't need that in your life, even.
[01:26:56] So wife and father.
[01:26:57] You don't get the subscription, do the recurring one every month.
[01:26:59] Everything wants to have an off-ing.
[01:27:00] You take them.
[01:27:01] Depending, you know, how, how nuts you want to get.
[01:27:04] Also, jacquil has a supplement.
[01:27:06] This is for your brain and your body.
[01:27:10] All in one.
[01:27:11] You don't have to take the pre-workout and the cognitive enhancing new tropic.
[01:27:16] You don't have to do that anywhere.
[01:27:17] You take to just the one called discipline.
[01:27:19] Takes good to, 11-line.
[01:27:21] For a small to-plier.
[01:27:23] Oh, we got it.
[01:27:24] No.
[01:27:25] No.
[01:27:26] Well, that's a good one.
[01:27:27] Take that. That'll help you.
[01:27:28] That'll help you to stay on task.
[01:27:30] Find all the words that you're looking for to use.
[01:27:33] You know, you don't want to, what do you call that anyway?
[01:27:36] That brain, far-brain, far-certainly more.
[01:27:38] Not lanes, not lane, it's not lane, it's a lane word when I say it.
[01:27:41] Absent, mind, didn't this?
[01:27:42] Absent, mind, didn't this?
[01:27:43] You know, it kind of combats all that stuff.
[01:27:46] Present, mind, madness is the opposite of apps.
[01:27:49] Technically.
[01:27:50] Right, that's technically, yeah.
[01:27:51] Nonetheless, promote that.
[01:27:53] And you're all good. It's called discipline.
[01:27:55] Get all these at originmain.com.
[01:27:58] The company is origin. I say origin main.
[01:28:00] I just, that's the company I say it's origin main.
[01:28:03] But it's really called origin.
[01:28:04] It's in main.
[01:28:05] The website is originmain.com.
[01:28:08] Also an origin main.
[01:28:10] Gees and Rashgarts for your jiu-jitsu journey.
[01:28:12] Important journey, by the way.
[01:28:14] I would say 90.
[01:28:16] I would say everyone.
[01:28:17] 100% 100%.
[01:28:19] Almost 100% of people who start jiu-jitsu will say, okay, it's valuable.
[01:28:22] Whether they stick with it or not, you cannot deny the value of jiu-jitsu.
[01:28:26] Even though that one of the questions earlier,
[01:28:29] boom, you inoculate yourself, you know,
[01:28:32] to all these things.
[01:28:33] And it's weird how it affects the rest of your life.
[01:28:35] Jiu-jitsu is good.
[01:28:37] Yeah, for your whole life.
[01:28:38] Yeah.
[01:28:39] Nonetheless, when you start, you get asked,
[01:28:41] what gees should I get?
[01:28:43] Guess what? Origin.
[01:28:44] You get an origin-gee, main in America.
[01:28:46] The fabrics made in America.
[01:28:48] The cotton to make the fabric is made in America.
[01:28:51] We're going all the way down to grown.
[01:28:53] He's straight up from dirt, from the dirt.
[01:28:56] To the sugar.
[01:28:57] To the geetop, to all that stuff.
[01:28:59] They also got hoodies.
[01:29:01] Pizza and me some new sweat suit situation.
[01:29:06] No, joggers.
[01:29:07] Are they nice?
[01:29:08] Got them on right now.
[01:29:09] Straight up, most comfortable.
[01:29:11] Most comfortable clothes.
[01:29:12] Most comfortable clothes.
[01:29:14] Close.
[01:29:16] This goes for all clothing.
[01:29:18] I've ever had.
[01:29:19] And that's saying a lot.
[01:29:21] It's really most comfortable for us.
[01:29:23] Straight up is straight up.
[01:29:25] Yes.
[01:29:26] 100%.
[01:29:27] Is it because it's made in America?
[01:29:29] Maybe, maybe not.
[01:29:30] But it does speak a lot for the quality of origin in it of itself.
[01:29:33] And oh, wait, it's comfortable because it was made in America.
[01:29:36] That's the question.
[01:29:37] Is it?
[01:29:38] Or isn't it?
[01:29:39] I don't know.
[01:29:40] But it is comfortable.
[01:29:41] 100%.
[01:29:42] The most comfortable.
[01:29:43] That's a good type.
[01:29:44] I know it is.
[01:29:45] Because you are one that deals high and comfort.
[01:29:47] Yes.
[01:29:48] I mean, comfort kind of sore.
[01:29:49] 100%.
[01:29:50] And this one graded off the charts.
[01:29:53] Check.
[01:29:54] But later, you take a break.
[01:29:55] So I export stuff.
[01:29:57] You know, in video editing, especially if actually you had to export.
[01:30:00] So 3D stuff, export takes long time.
[01:30:02] 3D studio max.
[01:30:04] So what it's called.
[01:30:05] Ticks long time.
[01:30:07] So while it exports, you start using your computer doing other things.
[01:30:11] It kind of, you know, you can jam your up.
[01:30:13] It'll slow down your computer whatever.
[01:30:14] So you know, I take a little break.
[01:30:15] I'm going to lay it out on the couch.
[01:30:16] I'm going to order you in whole sweat suit on.
[01:30:18] Get some.
[01:30:19] And I lay down on the couch.
[01:30:20] And like this for some reason, I'm the most comfortable I've ever been in my life.
[01:30:25] You need to make.
[01:30:26] I'll talk to Pete.
[01:30:27] You need like a signature series.
[01:30:31] Come for it.
[01:30:32] Come for it.
[01:30:33] Yeah.
[01:30:34] Yeah.
[01:30:35] Yeah.
[01:30:36] Right.
[01:30:37] Have it on right now.
[01:30:37] That's it.
[01:30:38] You know, you got to do a rename and embroidery on the side.
[01:30:39] Boom.
[01:30:40] That's awesome.
[01:30:41] That's it.
[01:30:42] You know, you got to do a rename and embroidery on the side.
[01:30:43] Boom.
[01:30:44] That's awesome.
[01:30:45] So comfort is kind of a subjective thing.
[01:30:47] Maybe.
[01:30:48] Well, okay.
[01:30:49] I challenge anyone.
[01:30:50] If you have the origin sweatsuit or if you get one, get on it.
[01:30:54] Lay it on on your couch.
[01:30:56] Temperature would have to be just right because if it's hot and you have sweatsuit on,
[01:30:59] and nothing is comfortable.
[01:31:00] But keep that in mind.
[01:31:02] I challenge you to do that.
[01:31:03] Report back.
[01:31:04] If it's not the most comfortable, let me know for 100%.
[01:31:07] You're going to taste them for real comfort.
[01:31:10] American made comfort to buy the way.
[01:31:12] Also.
[01:31:13] If you're into jujitsu.
[01:31:16] Right.
[01:31:17] If you're not into jujitsu, there was a jujitsu immersion camp on all this 26 this year.
[01:31:22] Goes to September 2nd, one week.
[01:31:24] Two sessions in that one week.
[01:31:26] Yeah.
[01:31:27] I'm going.
[01:31:28] Jocca's doing going.
[01:31:29] And so it's Dave Burke.
[01:31:30] The real top gun.
[01:31:31] The real top gun.
[01:31:32] Burke.
[01:31:33] Yes.
[01:31:34] Good deal.
[01:31:34] You know why he's going?
[01:31:36] He sounded like a good deal.
[01:31:37] It's a good deal.
[01:31:39] It's a good deal.
[01:31:40] It's a good deal.
[01:31:43] It's a good deal.
[01:31:44] It's a good deal.
[01:31:45] It's a good deal.
[01:31:46] It's a good deal.
[01:31:48] It's a good deal.
[01:31:49] It's a good deal.
[01:31:50] It's a good deal.
[01:31:51] It's a win, win, win, win.
[01:31:53] It's like the best.
[01:31:54] A good deal.
[01:31:55] It's like the best case scenario kind of thing.
[01:31:56] That's what a good deal Dave is all about.
[01:31:58] That's just him.
[01:31:59] That's how he is.
[01:32:00] How he rolls.
[01:32:01] Unless.
[01:32:02] Other people would be there.
[01:32:03] It wasn't either.
[01:32:04] Hopefully JP.
[01:32:05] Yeah.
[01:32:06] And life.
[01:32:07] Well, life just got his a strike.
[01:32:09] Another strike on the white belt.
[01:32:11] No white belt.
[01:32:12] Yeah.
[01:32:13] So he might very well be there.
[01:32:14] I think I'll be able to do it by that.
[01:32:16] Maybe.
[01:32:17] Should this pace?
[01:32:18] Yeah.
[01:32:19] If he keeps trading hard.
[01:32:20] Yeah.
[01:32:21] And he has part of the knowledge as well.
[01:32:22] Yeah.
[01:32:23] He never know.
[01:32:24] Yeah.
[01:32:25] So did you see, immerse yourself in your just to best
[01:32:26] wait and learn in my opinion.
[01:32:27] Mine too.
[01:32:28] Not even if you've never gone go.
[01:32:30] Because last time I even went on the side with beginner beginners.
[01:32:36] Like one day zero days experience boom.
[01:32:39] We go through some stuff from and I'm not saying look cool.
[01:32:43] I'm such a good teacher.
[01:32:44] I'm not saying that at all.
[01:32:45] But after like that session, they were ready to go start rolling.
[01:32:49] Humble brag.
[01:32:50] Just saying.
[01:32:52] I know this because that's what they said.
[01:32:54] Not all of them, but some of them said that.
[01:32:57] Nonetheless, I'm saying there's a lot of values.
[01:32:59] You did some value if you've never done you used to before.
[01:33:02] Never.
[01:33:03] Yeah.

[01:34:15] kettlebells, battle ropes, maces.
[01:34:17] Go to on it.com slash jockel.
[01:34:20] I once said, well, actually more than once said that.
[01:34:24] Jockel's workouts are boring.
[01:34:26] They're not.
[01:34:27] I get it.
[01:34:28] They're not boring.
[01:34:29] I retract that statement.
[01:34:31] They're not boring.
[01:34:32] But if you run the risk of gear workouts being boring, just get some new equipment.
[01:34:39] Actually, it's good.
[01:34:40] Because you know when you get new equipment,
[01:34:41] like it, even something that's supposed to jump rope.
[01:34:43] Right, when you get it, kind of rejuvenates a little party.
[01:34:46] You know, it's like when you get a new geek.
[01:34:48] You want to go to practice more.
[01:34:49] You know, you buy some new running shoes.
[01:34:51] Like you kind of compelled to go running.

[01:34:58] And if you go to on it.
[01:35:00] You get some new fitness gear.
[01:35:03] It'll introduce a little variety to your workout.
[01:35:05] Different gear, different movement, different workout.
[01:35:09] Keep it on the path even more.
[01:35:11] And make it interesting.
[01:35:12] Maybe fun, man.
[01:35:13] I think it's my opinion.
[01:35:14] Anyway, on it.

[01:36:06] Anyway, shareable stuff.
[01:36:08] Like so, you don't have to share a two, three hour podcast with someone.
[01:36:11] And then, you know, when you get something in your message or inbox or whatever.
[01:36:14] And it's two hours long.
[01:36:15] And I'm watching it straight up.
[01:36:17] In fact, I would say even right when you press play.
[01:36:20] Before you even get to like five seconds in, you check.
[01:36:23] See how long it is.
[01:36:24] I think that's a normal protocol.
[01:36:25] That is a normal protocol.
[01:36:26] You see two hours you're clicking right out of there.
[01:36:28] The friends, what it is.
[01:36:29] Depend on what it is and depends on.
[01:36:30] But there's not too often that you just got a two hour block from sitting the sit in the side.
[01:36:35] Right.
[01:36:36] Randomly somebody sent me a video.
[01:36:37] Yeah.
[01:36:38] I'll watch right now.
[01:36:39] Yeah, that's not happening.
[01:36:40] Yeah, typically doesn't happen like that.
[01:36:41] But three minutes, four minutes.
[01:36:43] Yeah.
[01:36:44] And you might share it with your, you know, your friend.

[01:36:52] Psychological warfare.
[01:36:54] You know what that is?
[01:36:55] This is what it is.
[01:36:56] It's an album with tracks on this album.
[01:36:59] Not music tracks.
[01:37:00] It's jockel tracks.
[01:37:01] And these tracks each track is designated engineered.
[01:37:06] If you will.
[01:37:07] To help you me.
[01:37:09] To help me.
[01:37:10] It's what it is.
[01:37:11] But it will help you.
[01:37:13] Get past little moments of weakness that you might encounter.
[01:37:17] I'm not saying everyone's going to encounter it.
[01:37:19] Everyone probably will encounter it.
[01:37:21] But that's not the point here.
[01:37:22] Point is, if you do encounter it, you got something to help you.
[01:37:25] You got jockel to help you.
[01:37:26] That's a good deal.
[01:37:28] You want to skip to work out or something like this.
[01:37:31] You don't feel like working out.
[01:37:32] That's really what it is.
[01:37:33] You don't feel like working out.
[01:37:35] The comfort of not working out is distracting you is what it is.
[01:37:39] But it seems more appealing than the discomfort of working out.
[01:37:45] So what it is.
[01:37:47] And then you listen to a track.
[01:37:50] There's a certain track for that.
[01:37:51] Jocquie explains to you why you shouldn't miss the workout.
[01:37:54] Boom.
[01:37:55] Part of the workout you're good.
[01:37:56] And for every little weakness that you might come across is a track for it.
[01:37:58] It's all good.

[01:38:19] What else could I say?
[01:38:21] Regardless of age, everyone should know.
[01:38:24] And you should be careful with that.
