00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16 This is Jockel Podcast number 63.
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:07.36 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:07.36 --> 00:00:08.64 Good evening echo.
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:09.64 Good evening.
00:00:13.28 --> 00:00:16.32 I am an American fighting man.
00:00:16.32 --> 00:00:21.76 I serve in the forces which guard my country and our way of life.
00:00:21.76 --> 00:00:26.68 I am prepared to give my life in their defense.
00:00:26.68 --> 00:00:31.44 I will never surrender of my own free will.
00:00:31.44 --> 00:00:39.64 If in command I will never surrender my men while they still have the means to resist.
00:00:39.64 --> 00:00:45.88 If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available.
00:00:45.88 --> 00:00:48.48 I will make every effort to escape.
00:00:48.48 --> 00:00:55.24 I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.
00:00:55.24 --> 00:01:01.000 If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners.
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.92 I will give no information or take part in any actions which might be harmful to my comrades.
00:01:07.92 --> 00:01:11.48 If I am senior, I will take command.
00:01:11.48 --> 00:01:17.04 If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them
00:01:17.04 --> 00:01:21.64 up in every way.
00:01:21.64 --> 00:01:25.16 One question should I become a prisoner of war.
00:01:25.16 --> 00:01:32.40 I am bound to give only name, rank, service number and date of birth.
00:01:32.40 --> 00:01:37.76 I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability.
00:01:37.76 --> 00:01:44.28 I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful
00:01:44.28 --> 00:01:48.000 to their cause.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.76 I will never forget that I am an American fighting man responsible for my actions and dedicated
00:01:54.76 --> 00:01:59.80 to the principles which made my country free.
00:01:59.80 --> 00:02:09.20 I will trust in God and in the United States of America.
00:02:09.20 --> 00:02:19.04 And that is the 1955 version of the Code of Conduct for the Armed Forces of the United
00:02:19.04 --> 00:02:22.000 States.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.72 And it was written in response to the brutal treatment of the 7,190 Americans captured
00:02:32.72 --> 00:02:35.28 by the enemy during the Korean War.
00:02:35.28 --> 00:02:45.84 prisoners who are subjected to torture, indoctrination, brainwashing and forced confessions.
00:02:45.84 --> 00:02:50.80 And that version of the Code that I just read is almost exactly the same as the one that
00:02:50.80 --> 00:02:55.84 I learned in the military when I joined in 1990.
00:02:55.84 --> 00:02:58.40 They did make some changes to it.
00:02:58.40 --> 00:03:05.20 They changed it to include men and women and they changed two words to give some flexibility
00:03:05.20 --> 00:03:13.20 to increase survivability and psychological recovery from torture.
00:03:13.20 --> 00:03:18.32 And so the little changes that were made it change from the prisoner being bound to give
00:03:18.32 --> 00:03:25.16 only name rank and service number and data birth to the prisoner being required to give
00:03:25.16 --> 00:03:30.92 name rank, service number and data birth.
00:03:30.92 --> 00:03:37.68 But the spirit of the Code didn't change at all.
00:03:37.68 --> 00:03:51.44 And that code is what we as military fighting men and women were and are expected to uphold.
00:03:51.44 --> 00:03:58.44 Should we ever be captured and held as prisoners by the enemy?
00:03:58.44 --> 00:04:08.32 What the Code of Conduct is simple and clear and straightforward.
00:04:08.32 --> 00:04:17.40 But the Code of Conduct gets tested unlike any other document in the world.
00:04:17.40 --> 00:04:25.72 When our American servicemen and women are somehow captured and as prisoners of war face
00:04:25.72 --> 00:04:35.24 absolutely ruthless levels of torture, pain, suffering, disease, starvation, humiliation
00:04:35.24 --> 00:04:44.96 and perhaps the most devastating hopelessness.
00:04:44.96 --> 00:04:59.28 And tonight it is my absolute honor to have one of these men here, one who during almost
00:04:59.28 --> 00:05:08.000 a full year of horror upon horror at the hands of his captors in Vietnam, man who persevered
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.84 and fought with every ounce of his soul to survive against the worst possible conditions
00:05:16.84 --> 00:05:20.08 imaginable.
00:05:20.08 --> 00:05:33.76 A man that not only learned the code of conduct but lived it retired Army Colonel William
00:05:33.76 --> 00:05:35.36 Bill Reader.
00:05:35.36 --> 00:05:40.32 Sir, thank you so much for being here tonight.
00:05:40.32 --> 00:05:41.32 Thank you, Jacko.
00:05:41.32 --> 00:05:46.72 It's my honor and need to be here and participate in this podcast as well.
00:05:46.72 --> 00:05:48.04 Thank you.
00:05:48.04 --> 00:05:54.60 I want to just before we jump into the book, if you could just talk a little bit about
00:05:54.60 --> 00:05:59.68 you growing up what you did, what you were like, where you were.
00:05:59.68 --> 00:06:00.68 Oh boy.
00:06:00.68 --> 00:06:03.12 Okay, I didn't know this was coming.
00:06:03.12 --> 00:06:07.52 Yeah, I was essentially a kid off the streets of Los Angeles as born in the Lendale grew
00:06:07.52 --> 00:06:13.68 up for a time in the San Fernando Valley, which is in the opening prologue to the book.
00:06:13.68 --> 00:06:16.16 Yeah, I had a tough childhood, I guess.
00:06:16.16 --> 00:06:22.12 I would say, God into some trouble is a young guy.
00:06:22.12 --> 00:06:26.20 Sports helped me at least survive to graduate from high school.
00:06:26.20 --> 00:06:31.24 Left college and I went off to college in a race of Idaho to study forestry.
00:06:31.24 --> 00:06:37.44 Left college and less than a steamed academic terms after only one year worked for time
00:06:37.44 --> 00:06:43.40 as a work to all the time as a kid with various small jobs, newspaper routes and selling
00:06:43.40 --> 00:06:47.64 magazines to door to door.
00:06:47.64 --> 00:06:51.32 Then did some construction work in my early teens, roofing work?
00:06:51.32 --> 00:06:55.92 But yeah, after I left college, I worked gallerances for a while, worked for the U.S.
00:06:55.92 --> 00:06:57.32 Forest Service for a time.
00:06:57.32 --> 00:07:01.72 Ultimately, as a firefighter, I got laid off in the end of fire season, went back home
00:07:01.72 --> 00:07:06.48 to Los Angeles and found a job with Southern California Edison in Santa Monica, climbing
00:07:06.48 --> 00:07:09.000 power lines as a apprentice lineman.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.12 And did that until the outbreak of the Vietnam War and then found my real niche in life
00:07:14.12 --> 00:07:18.52 when I walked into the Army recruiter in Santa Monica, California, and signed on the dotted
00:07:18.52 --> 00:07:19.52 line.
00:07:19.52 --> 00:07:20.52 What year was that?
00:07:20.52 --> 00:07:21.52 1965.
00:07:21.52 --> 00:07:24.56 So, you know, the Tonkin Gulf incident occurred.
00:07:24.56 --> 00:07:29.000 That's where the U.S. destroyers were attacked in 1964.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.84 We put Marines ashore in Denang in March of 1965.
00:07:31.84 --> 00:07:34.12 That's when I started talking to recruiters.
00:07:34.12 --> 00:07:39.96 First I was going to the Marine Corps, but somehow ended up in listing in the Army in August
00:07:39.96 --> 00:07:40.96 of 1965.
00:07:40.96 --> 00:07:43.48 And then was the transition to becoming a pilot?
00:07:43.48 --> 00:07:49.84 Yeah, so I started out in listed, I went to Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training
00:07:49.84 --> 00:07:56.84 at I.T. I was a T, I can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't
00:07:56.84 --> 00:07:57.84 here.
00:07:57.84 --> 00:07:57.84 Member of a can and crew in an artillery unit and then applied for Officer Candidate School.
00:07:57.84 --> 00:08:01.96 And they took those with the highest test scores, you had to pass the series of interviews,
00:08:01.96 --> 00:08:05.44 but they were looking for officers and especially artillery, latinants.
00:08:05.44 --> 00:08:10.80 And so I went to artillery officer candidate school, six months of training, with some degree
00:08:10.80 --> 00:08:17.60 of harassment, and then got commissioned in August of 1966 as a second lieutenant in artillery.
00:08:17.60 --> 00:08:20.60 And then how long did you artillery before before he became a pilot?
00:08:20.60 --> 00:08:21.60 Yeah, that was about a year.
00:08:21.60 --> 00:08:23.08 I didn't think I was going to be able to fly.
00:08:23.08 --> 00:08:24.80 That's really why I didn't go in the Marine Corps.
00:08:24.80 --> 00:08:26.84 I wanted to be a pilot throwing two services.
00:08:26.84 --> 00:08:28.68 You could fly without a college degree.
00:08:28.68 --> 00:08:33.92 So this college dropout had hopes any of them Marine Corps or the Army when I went and saw
00:08:33.92 --> 00:08:36.52 the Marine recruiter, he gave me a battery of tests.
00:08:36.52 --> 00:08:41.36 And he said, yeah, you qualify for a flight and we can guarantee you a flight training.
00:08:41.36 --> 00:08:45.64 I said, okay, so what I have to do is as you go in as long as you pass a flight physical,
00:08:45.64 --> 00:08:46.96 you're good to go.
00:08:46.96 --> 00:08:49.72 So I could sense there was something a foot here.
00:08:49.72 --> 00:08:54.60 So before I went in, I went to a FAA flight service in Santa Monica, and he gave me the
00:08:54.60 --> 00:08:58.56 same flight physical the military does and tell me if I could pass it.
00:08:58.56 --> 00:09:01.80 So he gave me the physical and said, no, you wouldn't pass it.
00:09:01.80 --> 00:09:04.84 You said your right eye is about 20, 25 to 20, 30.
00:09:04.84 --> 00:09:06.32 You have an astigmatism.
00:09:06.32 --> 00:09:07.96 They require a perfect 20, 20 vision.
00:09:07.96 --> 00:09:10.32 You couldn't pass the flight physical.
00:09:10.32 --> 00:09:12.000 So I wrote off the Marine Corps.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000 I wasn't going to do that.
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.76 And I went into the Army instead thinking I would never fly.
00:09:17.76 --> 00:09:21.76 After I went to Officer Kennedy School, I commissioned, I was working in an Artillery Assignment
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:26.68 at Fort Carson, Colorado, and went in for an annual physical.
00:09:26.68 --> 00:09:29.20 And when I got the physical, it came back 2020 both eyes.
00:09:29.20 --> 00:09:34.12 So I was in like Flynn took that down to the flight service and put my application in and
00:09:34.12 --> 00:09:35.32 went off to flight school.
00:09:35.32 --> 00:09:36.32 Awesome.
00:09:36.32 --> 00:09:37.32 Awesome.
00:09:37.32 --> 00:09:43.16 So I'm going to jump into the book here.
00:09:43.16 --> 00:09:45.16 You spent your first torn Vietnam.
00:09:45.16 --> 00:09:46.56 I think it was your first torn Vietnam.
00:09:46.56 --> 00:09:47.92 You were flying the Mohawk.
00:09:47.92 --> 00:09:48.92 Right.
00:09:48.92 --> 00:09:50.56 So first torn Vietnam.
00:09:50.56 --> 00:09:58.08 And by the way, we were talking about the podcast about how much risk you guys took in
00:09:58.08 --> 00:10:00.24 Vietnam as pilots.
00:10:00.24 --> 00:10:01.24 It's actually crazy.
00:10:01.24 --> 00:10:02.24 We'll get into more of that.
00:10:02.24 --> 00:10:05.20 But one of the things that struck me is I'm in the beginning of your book and you're
00:10:05.20 --> 00:10:07.28 talking about how you got shot down on your first deployment.
00:10:07.28 --> 00:10:09.68 It's Vietnam as a pilot.
00:10:09.68 --> 00:10:13.44 So here's you telling that story to your crew.
00:10:13.44 --> 00:10:16.52 When you're going your second deployment that you said, yeah, the first couple operations
00:10:16.52 --> 00:10:18.24 we've done here, they've been pretty exciting.
00:10:18.24 --> 00:10:20.12 But you know, I had some good ones on my last deployment too.
00:10:20.12 --> 00:10:22.80 By the way, I got shot down.
00:10:22.80 --> 00:10:24.84 So here, I'm going to go to the book here.
00:10:24.84 --> 00:10:27.32 This is what happened when you got shot down for the first time.
00:10:27.32 --> 00:10:31.72 Took a 37 millimeter, millimeter, millimeter, anti-aircraft hit in the right wing attacking a
00:10:31.72 --> 00:10:35.04 fuel, depo hitting under the trees.
00:10:35.04 --> 00:10:37.64 Last five mission in Louss over the Ho Chi Mintrail.
00:10:37.64 --> 00:10:41.92 I pulled up from a rocket run, wham the whole right side of the aircraft seemed to explode.
00:10:41.92 --> 00:10:43.24 We tumbled out of control.
00:10:43.24 --> 00:10:46.68 The right wing shattered and was on fire, worked at hard.
00:10:46.68 --> 00:10:49.000 Got back some ability to fly.
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.40 Got the fire out.
00:10:50.40 --> 00:10:52.20 But we were descending fast.
00:10:52.20 --> 00:10:53.92 Could not hold altitude.
00:10:53.92 --> 00:10:55.80 Gave the command to eject.
00:10:55.80 --> 00:10:57.04 The observer went out.
00:10:57.04 --> 00:10:59.88 I pulled my seat handle right after.
00:10:59.88 --> 00:11:02.32 I had a very short parachute ride.
00:11:02.32 --> 00:11:06.96 I got partial shoot deployment before hitting the ground with a foot.
00:11:06.96 --> 00:11:10.84 We were crashing through the tree tops by the time I punched out.
00:11:10.84 --> 00:11:14.32 So for those people that don't know what all that means right there.
00:11:14.32 --> 00:11:18.72 That means when you pull an ejection handle on a, on a, on a, on a, on your in a plane,
00:11:18.72 --> 00:11:20.24 eject you out.
00:11:20.24 --> 00:11:23.96 But you're supposed to do it with some level of altitude, not when you're hitting the
00:11:23.96 --> 00:11:24.96 tree tops.
00:11:24.96 --> 00:11:29.96 So you're hitting the tree tops and that in the canopy, not opening all the way.
00:11:29.96 --> 00:11:33.24 That means that the full usage of the parachute isn't there.
00:11:33.24 --> 00:11:35.52 It's just sort of getting open and boom.
00:11:35.52 --> 00:11:36.88 It's the ground.
00:11:36.88 --> 00:11:41.48 My way man took a picture of my shoot down site and you can see the, the parachute is just
00:11:41.48 --> 00:11:44.52 all strong out and I'm laying there at the end of the parachute.
00:11:44.52 --> 00:11:46.52 I've never got a single oscillation.
00:11:46.52 --> 00:11:49.20 I got a partial shoot deployment hit the ground.
00:11:49.20 --> 00:11:51.60 I'm glad we considered laughing.
00:11:51.60 --> 00:11:54.16 And I am defending you by laughing at this.
00:11:54.16 --> 00:11:55.16 I don't know.
00:11:55.16 --> 00:11:58.88 No, you're not because you made a comment about, you know, taking the hits and the intensity
00:11:58.88 --> 00:11:59.88 come in, it was.
00:11:59.88 --> 00:12:01.28 It really was.
00:12:01.28 --> 00:12:07.28 But there's something crazy about young men and, and at that point in my life, I was a kid
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:10.48 living a dream and I got blown out of the sky on my first tour.
00:12:10.48 --> 00:12:16.36 Yes, I survived it and somehow in my crazy twisted mind, I couldn't wait to get back
00:12:16.36 --> 00:12:20.000 over on a second tour flying covert tack helicopters.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.32 By the way, so this is what happens once you get on the ground, here we go back to the
00:12:23.32 --> 00:12:25.08 book that I was nearly captured.
00:12:25.08 --> 00:12:30.12 I ran through the jungle 45 minutes while my wingman put down suppressive fire.
00:12:30.12 --> 00:12:33.44 That earned me the nickname light foot.
00:12:33.44 --> 00:12:37.60 Got plucked out of the jungle by an air force helicopter from the 20th special operations
00:12:37.60 --> 00:12:41.000 squadron out of Thailand called the call sign pony express.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.44 Spent some time in the hospital there, eventually I returned to the unit back to flight
00:12:44.44 --> 00:12:45.44 duties.
00:12:45.44 --> 00:12:46.60 This incredible.
00:12:46.60 --> 00:12:51.04 We lost 15 airplanes at that point out of 18.
00:12:51.04 --> 00:12:54.44 30 crew members shot down not many of them ever recovered.
00:12:54.44 --> 00:12:57.12 I was one of the few lousy odds.
00:12:57.12 --> 00:13:04.000 I was scared then I'll tell you if you don't get scared and combat your liar or nuts.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.68 Only after a tense mission is over.
00:13:07.68 --> 00:13:09.56 Does the real fright come?
00:13:09.56 --> 00:13:13.48 When there's time to sit and think you watched all play out in your mind and wonder how
00:13:13.48 --> 00:13:18.12 the hell you live through something like that.
00:13:18.12 --> 00:13:24.36 So again we were talking before before we pressed record about how protective of
00:13:24.36 --> 00:13:26.64 America is of its aircraft right now.
00:13:26.64 --> 00:13:34.16 I can't even imagine you guys had 15 out of 18 airplanes that were shot down.
00:13:34.16 --> 00:13:36.04 That's insane.
00:13:36.04 --> 00:13:39.80 That was a sophisticated expensive aircraft for the army at the time.
00:13:39.80 --> 00:13:43.16 The Mohawk was pretty much top of the line technology.
00:13:43.16 --> 00:13:56.44 The Army aircraft.
00:13:56.44 --> 00:13:58.88 That was a special unit.
00:13:58.88 --> 00:14:03.08 We had five Mohawk companies in Vietnam at that time.
00:14:03.08 --> 00:14:07.36 Four of them were for each of the four core tactical zones inside of South Vietnam.
00:14:07.36 --> 00:14:10.36 They flew missions and support of those areas.
00:14:10.36 --> 00:14:12.68 We were the fifth company, the bastard company.
00:14:12.68 --> 00:14:14.32 We flew out of Waifu Bay.
00:14:14.32 --> 00:14:17.56 The only time we saw South Vietnam was to take off some landings.
00:14:17.56 --> 00:14:20.44 All of our missions were in the Low, so we're up off the coast of North Vietnam.
00:14:20.44 --> 00:14:22.48 And then I had one highly classified one.
00:14:22.48 --> 00:14:26.44 I had to deploy down to Tonsonud at Saigon to go into Cambodia.
00:14:26.44 --> 00:14:28.04 I didn't know what that was all about.
00:14:28.04 --> 00:14:30.04 It was really high shots at the time.
00:14:30.04 --> 00:14:33.80 That was in the advance of the big Cambodian curves in the took place.
00:14:33.80 --> 00:14:37.000 Did they develop the Mohawk's four-vegetnome?
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.40 Because it's an interesting aircraft.
00:14:38.40 --> 00:14:40.000 It's a side-by-side, right?
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000 And it's a prop plane.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.12 Yeah, twin-turbo prop was built purely for reconnaissance and surveillance, grumminer
00:14:46.12 --> 00:14:47.12 aircraft.
00:14:47.12 --> 00:14:49.28 But if you guys went ahead and put missiles on them, it rocked.
00:14:49.28 --> 00:14:50.28 We put rockets there.
00:14:50.28 --> 00:14:51.76 There were zoonie missiles, firebearing.
00:14:51.76 --> 00:14:54.96 We had rockets and pod-bounded machine guns.
00:14:54.96 --> 00:14:57.40 That led to my covert experience.
00:14:57.40 --> 00:15:01.20 Because I really, that was my favorite mission where the gun missions in the Mohawk, not all
00:15:01.20 --> 00:15:02.20 of Morar.
00:15:02.20 --> 00:15:04.36 But I liked the gun missions.
00:15:04.36 --> 00:15:07.96 When I came back my first tour, there was a spat between the Army and the Air Force and
00:15:07.96 --> 00:15:10.96 the result of the spat was we had to take all the armament off the Mohawks.
00:15:10.96 --> 00:15:14.88 So when I went back on second tour, I wanted to go on a gun ship, not something without
00:15:14.88 --> 00:15:17.48 gun, so that got me into cobras.
00:15:17.48 --> 00:15:19.96 Yeah, that's weird.
00:15:19.96 --> 00:15:26.16 Those bureaucratic spats happen and decisions like it, that get made, that's really disturbing.
00:15:26.16 --> 00:15:28.64 So let's get into your second tour, right?
00:15:28.64 --> 00:15:31.84 And I'm going to jump into this piece here.
00:15:31.84 --> 00:15:32.84 Back to the book.
00:15:32.84 --> 00:15:36.04 On April 14th, we received a radio call that fire base Charlie was under attack by two
00:15:36.04 --> 00:15:44.04 regiments, 3,000 soldiers of the 320th NVA infantry division and 130 millimeter artillery
00:15:44.04 --> 00:15:45.88 shells were pounding the position.
00:15:45.88 --> 00:15:52.64 So you guys get this call, this friendly base is being overrun basically.
00:15:52.64 --> 00:15:55.16 And you show up on the scene.
00:15:55.16 --> 00:15:59.64 Now you're fine, a cobra, which for those of you that don't know, a gun ship, as you
00:15:59.64 --> 00:16:02.80 just said, it's still in service today.
00:16:02.80 --> 00:16:03.80 The Marine Corps.
00:16:03.80 --> 00:16:08.80 So it was a very narrow skinny space on a hewie, right?
00:16:08.80 --> 00:16:13.16 Yeah, it was, you know, the hewie was designed and went to Vietnam and most of us,
00:16:13.16 --> 00:16:17.56 more or the hewie, the hewie took on a gun mission though, that Vietnam, we saw the utility
00:16:17.56 --> 00:16:19.64 of guns on an aircraft.
00:16:19.64 --> 00:16:23.52 So the cobra then was designed specifically and only as a gun ship.
00:16:23.52 --> 00:16:27.92 And they took the hewie designed, narrowed it down to 36 inches pilot in the backseat,
00:16:27.92 --> 00:16:34.16 a high pilot gun on the front seat, 2.75 rockets on the wing stores, many gun and 40
00:16:34.16 --> 00:16:40.16 millimeter grenade launcher and a movable nose turret and that was one killing machine.
00:16:40.16 --> 00:16:44.04 And it still apparently brings a giant smile to your face when you talk about that, which
00:16:44.04 --> 00:16:45.04 is lovely.
00:16:45.04 --> 00:16:46.28 Yeah, and I don't want to seem twisted.
00:16:46.28 --> 00:16:50.56 I mean, I said at the time, I was a kid living a dream and I was, but I don't want
00:16:50.56 --> 00:16:55.16 to take away from the horror of combat and it was scary as crap.
00:16:55.16 --> 00:17:00.84 On every single mission, but there's still something about a young guy going to war,
00:17:00.84 --> 00:17:03.44 at least a certain type of young guy.
00:17:03.44 --> 00:17:08.56 And those that were in the two units I served in, that yeah, we were dedicated what we
00:17:08.56 --> 00:17:11.80 did and I think we did it well and I'm still smiling about it.
00:17:11.80 --> 00:17:17.44 Well, like so far, every guy I've brought into this podcast has the exact same attitude.
00:17:17.44 --> 00:17:19.48 So you're among friends here.
00:17:19.48 --> 00:17:21.92 So I'm going now, you guys are there.
00:17:21.92 --> 00:17:24.80 You show up with your with your cobras back to the book.
00:17:24.80 --> 00:17:27.44 We made several passes on enemy guns.
00:17:27.44 --> 00:17:32.88 Bullet stream past our cockpit says the NVA gunners tried to bring us down, rolling in on
00:17:32.88 --> 00:17:35.32 a 51 position as always, DIC.
00:17:35.32 --> 00:17:37.56 So this is a 51 caliber.
00:17:37.56 --> 00:17:38.56 It's a Dishka.
00:17:38.56 --> 00:17:42.56 It's an anti-aircraft machine gun and they actually had those when we were in a Romadi.
00:17:42.56 --> 00:17:47.12 They still had Dishkas and they used them against us.
00:17:47.12 --> 00:17:49.08 Tracers come at you and miss by a few feet.
00:17:49.08 --> 00:17:53.16 We try to get rockets onto him before he gets lucky and blast you out of the sky.
00:17:53.16 --> 00:17:55.56 We took small arms hits.
00:17:55.56 --> 00:18:00.88 My knees vibrated like a sewing machine, but I focused on controlling the helicopter, lining
00:18:00.88 --> 00:18:02.56 up the gun sights and shooting.
00:18:02.56 --> 00:18:05.40 I was scared but had no time for it.
00:18:05.40 --> 00:18:12.52 Dan Radeode, Dusty, Sinai Panther 1, 3, Panther 1, 3, B advice, running low on fuel out
00:18:12.52 --> 00:18:17.76 of ammo, we're breaking station for rearm refuel.
00:18:17.76 --> 00:18:22.60 Roger 13, 4 gun crews taking out good work, hurry back.
00:18:22.60 --> 00:18:26.16 So you're rating to the guy on the ground.
00:18:26.16 --> 00:18:27.16 Who's there?
00:18:27.16 --> 00:18:31.88 So there's an American advisor on the ground with a bunch of selfie-intemies soldiers.
00:18:31.88 --> 00:18:33.08 They're being overrun.
00:18:33.08 --> 00:18:34.32 You come in.
00:18:34.32 --> 00:18:37.04 You're taking heavy fire, but you're giving back fire.
00:18:37.04 --> 00:18:40.64 You tell him, hey, we got to go and get some more ammunition.
00:18:40.64 --> 00:18:42.08 He's saying good job.
00:18:42.08 --> 00:18:45.24 Hurry back.
00:18:45.24 --> 00:18:51.48 When you do show up back, the NVA attack is now more intense.
00:18:51.48 --> 00:18:55.12 And here's the call that you get when you show back up Panther.
00:18:55.12 --> 00:18:56.28 That's you by the way, Panther.
00:18:56.28 --> 00:18:57.88 Pink Panther is your, is your call.
00:18:57.88 --> 00:19:00.12 So as you're call sign is Panther.
00:19:00.12 --> 00:19:01.88 Here's the call you get Panther.
00:19:01.88 --> 00:19:03.84 The Battalion Commander is dead.
00:19:03.84 --> 00:19:05.64 Acting Commander wounded.
00:19:05.64 --> 00:19:08.12 Enemy broken through on the southwest.
00:19:08.12 --> 00:19:10.12 Put it there first.
00:19:10.12 --> 00:19:12.52 Then all around us.
00:19:12.52 --> 00:19:13.76 But real close.
00:19:13.76 --> 00:19:19.64 So for those people that don't understand what this means.
00:19:19.64 --> 00:19:25.52 When you're on the ground calling for fire, it's, and I've talked about a lot of
00:19:25.52 --> 00:19:28.000 Fratur side and blue on blue situations.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.44 I had them on my deployment.
00:19:30.44 --> 00:19:32.16 And it's a very scary thing.
00:19:32.16 --> 00:19:36.20 And it's even scarier from the air to the ground.
00:19:36.20 --> 00:19:38.48 It's hard for people to understand this.
00:19:38.48 --> 00:19:42.000 When you're in an aircraft, it's very hard to see what's happening on the ground.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.68 It can be very easy to get confused.
00:19:45.68 --> 00:19:52.20 And so it's hard to bring fire very close to your position unless you are just in a
00:19:52.20 --> 00:19:54.04 terrible situation.
00:19:54.04 --> 00:20:00.04 And so when you get a call that's saying, put the fire all around us as close as you
00:20:00.04 --> 00:20:01.04 can.
00:20:01.04 --> 00:20:04.24 You know this is a desperate scenario.
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:08.76 And so I'll go back to the book, Roger Dusty.
00:20:08.76 --> 00:20:12.28 We've got them after a number of cobra attack runs.
00:20:12.28 --> 00:20:13.60 Duffy called Panther Lee.
00:20:13.60 --> 00:20:14.60 This is Dusty cyanide.
00:20:14.60 --> 00:20:15.80 So that's the guy on the ground.
00:20:15.80 --> 00:20:16.80 That's his call.
00:20:16.80 --> 00:20:17.80 Synt dusty cyanide.
00:20:17.80 --> 00:20:19.56 You've broken the enemy attack for now.
00:20:19.56 --> 00:20:22.32 Hundreds of bodies in the wire may be a thousand.
00:20:22.32 --> 00:20:24.36 But we cannot hold.
00:20:24.36 --> 00:20:26.32 After a short break, he continued.
00:20:26.32 --> 00:20:28.72 We are leaving fire base Charlie now.
00:20:28.72 --> 00:20:30.32 Stop them from following us.
00:20:30.32 --> 00:20:31.84 Whatever it takes.
00:20:31.84 --> 00:20:37.24 Put your stuff right on top of the fire base now.
00:20:37.24 --> 00:20:45.24 And again, this is something that it just to explain what that means.
00:20:45.24 --> 00:20:49.76 If you don't understand what you've never in the military to explain, you're calling for
00:20:49.76 --> 00:20:55.40 people to drop fire onto your own position so that you can get away.
00:20:55.40 --> 00:20:57.48 It doesn't get any, there's nothing.
00:20:57.48 --> 00:20:59.000 It doesn't get any more intense.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.92 It doesn't get any more dramatic.
00:21:00.92 --> 00:21:04.32 It doesn't get any more sketchy than that right there.
00:21:04.32 --> 00:21:06.28 That was one hell of a fight.
00:21:06.28 --> 00:21:10.24 And John Joseph Duffy was the advisor, the American advisor on the ground.
00:21:10.24 --> 00:21:16.000 And he is a true American hero, Army Special Forces Officer had those advisor duties.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.64 That battle, the battle lasted for about two weeks.
00:21:18.64 --> 00:21:23.96 The climax of it was a couple days with that last night that has described in the book.
00:21:23.96 --> 00:21:29.48 Out of a 470 man, South Vietnamese airborne, peritrupt, batayan.
00:21:29.48 --> 00:21:34.40 At the end of that fight the next morning, the American advisor, John Joseph Duffy, and
00:21:34.40 --> 00:21:39.72 36 of the South Vietnamese were all that survived to be picked up when they got off of that
00:21:39.72 --> 00:21:41.000 fire base.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.64 And John was wounded five times in the battle.
00:21:44.64 --> 00:21:50.08 So yeah, 470 man, batayan, 36 survivors and they're wounded American advisor.
00:21:50.08 --> 00:21:51.88 Absolutely unbelievable.
00:21:51.88 --> 00:21:56.88 And I know you wrote in here that Major Duffy was recommended for the Medal of Honor
00:21:56.88 --> 00:22:02.16 and he got the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions.
00:22:02.16 --> 00:22:06.24 Which if you don't know what that is, it's the second highest award underneath the Medal
00:22:06.24 --> 00:22:07.24 of Honor.
00:22:07.24 --> 00:22:08.24 Yeah.
00:22:08.24 --> 00:22:12.24 And you actually talk about possibly writing about that battle.
00:22:12.24 --> 00:22:13.24 Did you?
00:22:13.24 --> 00:22:14.24 That's my next project.
00:22:14.24 --> 00:22:19.28 In doing this book, and there's a statement at the beginning of the book that I wrote
00:22:19.28 --> 00:22:23.96 this some 40 years after I experienced these actions.
00:22:23.96 --> 00:22:26.16 And some things were still perfectly clear in my mind.
00:22:26.16 --> 00:22:29.24 Other things were a little bit hazier than I thought they would be when I put pen
00:22:29.24 --> 00:22:30.24 to paper.
00:22:30.24 --> 00:22:35.20 So in the process of writing, I not only just dug down a mine mind and relived every
00:22:35.20 --> 00:22:38.52 experience as detailed as I could to get everything correct.
00:22:38.52 --> 00:22:43.52 I contacted those who were also involved in the actions to get their versions, their
00:22:43.52 --> 00:22:48.44 view, their recollections to be sure I had this as right as I could.
00:22:48.44 --> 00:22:51.52 John Joseph Duffy was one that I got a hold of, Major Duffy.
00:22:51.52 --> 00:22:55.24 I had never met him and never talked to him since that battle until I was able to track
00:22:55.24 --> 00:22:59.36 him down with the wonders of modern communication and internet.
00:22:59.36 --> 00:23:03.44 And in sharing the details about that fight, he dropped a couple of hints.
00:23:03.44 --> 00:23:07.16 He said, you know, somebody really ought to write the history of the Battle of Firebase
00:23:07.16 --> 00:23:08.16 Charlie.
00:23:08.16 --> 00:23:11.12 This is one of the most extraordinary fights in the entire Vietnam War.
00:23:11.12 --> 00:23:15.56 So I think it was after about the half a dozen times he said, I said, okay, John, I'll do
00:23:15.56 --> 00:23:16.56 it.
00:23:16.56 --> 00:23:17.56 I'll write it.
00:23:17.56 --> 00:23:20.28 So yes, right now I'm working on doing my research and getting everything in order
00:23:20.28 --> 00:23:24.88 to write the story of that battle in more detail than I give on my what couple of pages
00:23:24.88 --> 00:23:25.88 of my book.
00:23:25.88 --> 00:23:29.56 Yeah, that's one of the one of the most interesting things for me about doing this podcast
00:23:29.56 --> 00:23:35.12 and we're again, another thing we're talking about is there's so many, you know, I didn't
00:23:35.12 --> 00:23:39.32 know about that battle and I'm a pretty decent student of military history.
00:23:39.32 --> 00:23:43.96 I didn't know about that battle and didn't know about Major John Duffy.
00:23:43.96 --> 00:23:53.60 I absolutely should and we all should and what you realize is that battle, that man will
00:23:53.60 --> 00:23:56.20 never be able to account for all these heroes.
00:23:56.20 --> 00:24:01.68 You just can't do it.
00:24:01.68 --> 00:24:10.68 So again, this is fast forwarding a little bit through the book and by the way, I didn't
00:24:10.68 --> 00:24:11.68 mention the name of the book yet.
00:24:11.68 --> 00:24:12.68 Oh, yeah, thank you.
00:24:12.68 --> 00:24:21.84 The name of the book is through the valley, my captivity in Vietnam by William Reader and
00:24:21.84 --> 00:24:23.16 hit this book.
00:24:23.16 --> 00:24:33.04 So at this point, I'm jumping ahead a little bit to a situation where you've got and
00:24:33.04 --> 00:24:37.32 I'll go to the book, tanks in the wire at Poli Kling.
00:24:37.32 --> 00:24:40.96 Launch now and call me En route for their radio freak.
00:24:40.96 --> 00:24:43.12 Hawks claw will get up later.
00:24:43.12 --> 00:24:49.24 You'll be covering him to you have tail number 053 and 682 go.
00:24:49.24 --> 00:24:57.72 So that right there is something bad is happening and you've got to go now and what's
00:24:57.72 --> 00:25:02.84 interesting, I'll point this out for again, people that aren't in the military.
00:25:02.84 --> 00:25:06.40 By the way, a lot of guys that listen to this are in the military, a lot of law enforcement,
00:25:06.40 --> 00:25:10.44 but there's a lot of civilians that don't know everything that I'm talking about or
00:25:10.44 --> 00:25:12.36 that you're talking about.
00:25:12.36 --> 00:25:17.68 So what I like about this is that what they're telling, what they're telling, the kernel
00:25:17.68 --> 00:25:21.84 to do is launch your aircraft, just go get an aircraft and launch and start heading
00:25:21.84 --> 00:25:22.84 in that direction.
00:25:22.84 --> 00:25:25.36 We'll give you a frequency when you get up there.
00:25:25.36 --> 00:25:28.72 We'll tell you what's going to happen once you get up there but go.
00:25:28.72 --> 00:25:31.76 So again, this is an in-extremement situation.
00:25:31.76 --> 00:25:35.76 What we would do that would be similar to this in the SEAL teams is we would go on QRF
00:25:35.76 --> 00:25:39.76 missions, quick and reaction forces where they would call, they'd happen to me where they
00:25:39.76 --> 00:25:44.28 call and say, hey, something's going on here at this location, go.
00:25:44.28 --> 00:25:45.44 And I'd say, who's the unit?
00:25:45.44 --> 00:25:46.44 We don't know yet.
00:25:46.44 --> 00:25:48.80 Any frequency, what radio frequency on?
00:25:48.80 --> 00:25:49.80 We don't know yet.
00:25:49.80 --> 00:25:50.80 We'll get it to you.
00:25:50.80 --> 00:25:51.80 Launch.
00:25:51.80 --> 00:25:52.80 We get in our vehicles and launch.
00:25:52.80 --> 00:25:56.16 You develop the situation and route and then when you lay eyes on, when you get there and
00:25:56.16 --> 00:25:57.48 start talking to the folks.
00:25:57.48 --> 00:25:58.48 Yeah.
00:25:58.48 --> 00:25:59.48 Exactly.
00:25:59.48 --> 00:26:00.48 Back to the book.
00:26:00.48 --> 00:26:04.80 I stuffed a small emergency radio into one of the pockets of my survival vest.
00:26:04.80 --> 00:26:08.52 No time to perform the normal check on the radio.
00:26:08.52 --> 00:26:09.88 I had to include that.
00:26:09.88 --> 00:26:12.12 There's a lesson learned there.
00:26:12.12 --> 00:26:13.92 I had to include that.
00:26:13.92 --> 00:26:21.40 You know, the radio will always work if you test it in the one time you don't test it.
00:26:21.40 --> 00:26:22.96 Is the one time to talk about that?
00:26:22.96 --> 00:26:23.96 That's the lesson.
00:26:23.96 --> 00:26:24.96 Check all your survival gear.
00:26:24.96 --> 00:26:29.76 Be sure it's in order to be regardless of how hot that mission is.
00:26:29.76 --> 00:26:35.28 Now, you're heading to a place called the Ben Hat and we're going to the book.
00:26:35.28 --> 00:26:40.56 We headed to Ben Hat as we crossed the last ridge line, the entire valley before us was
00:26:40.56 --> 00:26:46.80 filled with smoke. Tracer streamed outward from defensive positions inside the camp.
00:26:46.80 --> 00:26:49.96 Enemy Tracer's replied from outside.
00:26:49.96 --> 00:26:53.28 Two jet fighters bombed next to the camp.
00:26:53.28 --> 00:26:57.80 NVA rockets artillery and mortars exploded in the camp.
00:26:57.80 --> 00:27:00.20 Enemy tanks breached the perimeter.
00:27:00.20 --> 00:27:03.88 One inside and part way up the hill looked like it had been killed already.
00:27:03.88 --> 00:27:05.44 I couldn't be sure.
00:27:05.44 --> 00:27:06.84 An AC 130.
00:27:06.84 --> 00:27:08.08 An Air Force AC 130.
00:27:08.08 --> 00:27:10.08 Spectre Gunship was leaving.
00:27:10.08 --> 00:27:15.96 He'd worked the area over with 20mm of Volk and Gatling Guns and 40mm cannon's probably
00:27:15.96 --> 00:27:17.48 hitting the tank.
00:27:17.48 --> 00:27:20.60 Enemy infantry move through openings in the jungle canopy.
00:27:20.60 --> 00:27:26.000 I could see groups assembling to join the attack.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.72 Yeah, it was one heck of a heck of a battle.
00:27:29.72 --> 00:27:34.12 This whole situation we're getting to in the book occurred during the Easter offensive of
00:27:34.12 --> 00:27:36.12 1972.
00:27:36.12 --> 00:27:39.76 When I arrived back in Vietnam at the end of 1971, it seemed like the war was over.
00:27:39.76 --> 00:27:43.68 In fact, I was afraid that maybe I'd missed my chance for combat in a cobra because things
00:27:43.68 --> 00:27:46.12 were so quiet.
00:27:46.12 --> 00:27:50.24 Many American, in fact, most American forces have been withdrawn in the central part of
00:27:50.24 --> 00:27:53.92 Vietnam, the central Highlands where I was operating, there were no American ground forces
00:27:53.92 --> 00:27:54.92 left at all.
00:27:54.92 --> 00:27:59.56 It's just some special forces guys, Army aviation units and some Air Force units.
00:27:59.56 --> 00:28:01.92 That was it.
00:28:01.92 --> 00:28:06.72 How that changed is we got into the spring of 1972 because the enemy had been building
00:28:06.72 --> 00:28:10.72 up their divisions across the border and to allow some Cambodia.
00:28:10.72 --> 00:28:15.36 In the spring of 1972, the Alonso attack from the Demolatrizone and attack from Cambodia
00:28:15.36 --> 00:28:20.56 towards Saigon and then finally in April attacks across the central Highlands where we were.
00:28:20.56 --> 00:28:22.08 There were a lot of enemy.
00:28:22.08 --> 00:28:26.28 This day it had been head, of course, this is going to turn into the day, the day that
00:28:26.28 --> 00:28:28.12 we're getting to here.
00:28:28.12 --> 00:28:32.88 Yeah, elements of two North Vietnamese divisions with artillery, with anti-aircraft weapons
00:28:32.88 --> 00:28:39.12 galore and with armor going into the camp and there we showed up with our two cobras
00:28:39.12 --> 00:28:40.92 to do what we could do.
00:28:40.92 --> 00:28:43.92 Was that your first time seeing armor, enemy armor?
00:28:43.92 --> 00:28:46.32 No.
00:28:46.32 --> 00:28:50.000 But that period was on the 24th because this is a night the May.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.52 On the 24th of April, the enemy attacked the 22nd Arvin, that's Army of Vietnam, division
00:28:55.52 --> 00:28:59.96 headquarters at Tancan, which is a little bit further to the east from Benheat.
00:28:59.96 --> 00:29:05.76 So in the 24th of April, the attack Tancan and defeated and overran that NVA division with
00:29:05.76 --> 00:29:06.76 a number of tanks.
00:29:06.76 --> 00:29:10.48 So that was the first time I saw tanks in battle, then we come out of the night the May and
00:29:10.48 --> 00:29:12.28 I'm seeing tanks again.
00:29:12.28 --> 00:29:15.48 Hold the different ballgame for the guys on the ground.
00:29:15.48 --> 00:29:16.48 Yes.
00:29:16.48 --> 00:29:21.72 Yeah, this guerrilla war suddenly turned into a very conventional war fighting regular
00:29:21.72 --> 00:29:24.52 North Vietnamese divisions.
00:29:24.52 --> 00:29:29.48 Now once again, you had some time on station, you did a bunch of shooting and running and
00:29:29.48 --> 00:29:36.68 gunning, you had to go back to reload, refuel, and I'm going back to the book now on our
00:29:36.68 --> 00:29:37.88 way back to Benheat.
00:29:37.88 --> 00:29:42.80 We could see the battle continuing at Policlo and Coli Clang.
00:29:42.80 --> 00:29:47.20 Vietnamese Air Force A1 Skyraders do dropping bombs.
00:29:47.20 --> 00:29:51.28 We passed close enough to see one as it trailed smoke and flame and went into the ground
00:29:51.28 --> 00:29:53.000 in an awful explosion.
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.68 I saw a parachute and a May day call came over the radio emergency radio frequency.
00:29:58.68 --> 00:30:02.88 I called headquarters to tell them I was diverting for a few minutes to help cover the
00:30:02.88 --> 00:30:04.88 downed VNAAF.
00:30:04.88 --> 00:30:12.000 So the Vietnamese Air Force pilot, negative Panther 36 permission denied, proceed direct
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.36 to Benheat out.
00:30:14.36 --> 00:30:16.68 You try to again, same results.
00:30:16.68 --> 00:30:23.36 So you saw the North Vietnamese Air Force pilot get shot down and you call back to base
00:30:23.36 --> 00:30:26.08 to say I'm going to go cover for this guy when they try and rescue him and they tell
00:30:26.08 --> 00:30:27.08 you know.
00:30:27.08 --> 00:30:31.88 Right.
00:30:31.88 --> 00:30:34.28 Now, so you do what you're told here.
00:30:34.28 --> 00:30:35.28 Yeah, decisions and combat.
00:30:35.28 --> 00:30:37.48 I mean, there's pluses and minuses to that.
00:30:37.48 --> 00:30:40.80 There were guys on the ground at Benheat and serious trouble.
00:30:40.80 --> 00:30:44.52 Benheat, there were two Vietnamese Ranger battions.
00:30:44.52 --> 00:30:51.88 So probably four or 500 people at the most, probably 400 people on the ground at Benheat
00:30:51.88 --> 00:30:53.20 with two American advisors.
00:30:53.20 --> 00:30:54.36 There's two Americans on the ground.
00:30:54.36 --> 00:30:57.56 They're under attack by elements of two North Vietnamese divisions.
00:30:57.56 --> 00:31:01.28 Which means thousands of infantry with the tanks, artillery, everything attacking.
00:31:01.28 --> 00:31:03.12 So yeah, they weren't in dire straits.
00:31:03.12 --> 00:31:08.000 Though I really had hope we could briefly stop over and help get this Vietnam Vietnamese
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.56 Air Force pilot to pick up.
00:31:09.56 --> 00:31:13.000 Yeah, no, that's a tough decision for command to make.
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.76 But from my position, I look at it like, okay, the command has a better overall view of
00:31:17.76 --> 00:31:19.24 the battlefield right now.
00:31:19.24 --> 00:31:24.12 And if they're telling me to proceed on to Benheat, God, even though you obviously is a pilot,
00:31:24.12 --> 00:31:25.12 you have a little good.
00:31:25.12 --> 00:31:26.72 I'm glad you have that perspective.
00:31:26.72 --> 00:31:31.12 I think now that at the time it all, well it's easy for me right now to send the air
00:31:31.12 --> 00:31:34.92 condition space with my heads at on.
00:31:34.92 --> 00:31:38.56 So much in Vietnam, and warfare is different today.
00:31:38.56 --> 00:31:44.28 And I think things are probably much more planned out and you go to a certain rules
00:31:44.28 --> 00:31:46.64 and procedures more than we did.
00:31:46.64 --> 00:31:50.84 So many of these combat missions with cobras in Vietnam and that day and age, we would get
00:31:50.84 --> 00:31:55.28 launched out of our base and we'd go out and make contact with people and it was pretty
00:31:55.28 --> 00:31:59.68 much up to the pilot and commander, the air mission commander, to decide where he would
00:31:59.68 --> 00:32:04.52 go and how he would support and what was the hottest fire in town that needed help.
00:32:04.52 --> 00:32:08.40 So we always, in some of it was just like, yes, our pompous attitude too.
00:32:08.40 --> 00:32:12.64 We always felt we had a better handle on what was happening than the guys in the headquarters
00:32:12.64 --> 00:32:14.84 that made some of those decisions.
00:32:14.84 --> 00:32:20.92 In fact, when we first saw tanks in the area before that battle at Tankan on the 24th of April,
00:32:20.92 --> 00:32:26.32 we saw tanks and reported them back through headquarters and there was a great deal of reluctance
00:32:26.32 --> 00:32:30.12 on the part of anybody and that Corps staff to believe that there were tanks.
00:32:30.12 --> 00:32:34.92 There was a guy that, in fact, this is another interesting situation at Vietnam, and that time,
00:32:34.92 --> 00:32:39.28 the senior commander in two Corps, that area that I was operating on, was not a military
00:32:39.28 --> 00:32:40.28 guy.
00:32:40.28 --> 00:32:44.92 So civilian named John Paul Van and Mr. Van made all the decisions.
00:32:44.92 --> 00:32:49.44 Now to keep things legal, he had a two-star army general officer working for him.
00:32:49.44 --> 00:32:54.60 So all military orders came through the army general, but Mr. Van was making the decisions.
00:32:54.60 --> 00:33:00.68 And when we reported we had seen tanks and mid-April, Van said, no, there's not tanks
00:33:00.68 --> 00:33:03.000 that I fly out there all the time if there are tanks I just seen him.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.08 He said, what you guys saw are probably elephants in the jungle.
00:33:06.08 --> 00:33:10.24 So that's what we dealt with with our headquarters.
00:33:10.24 --> 00:33:11.24 And that's interesting.
00:33:11.24 --> 00:33:16.36 There definitely was, when I was an Iraq, there was a very tight control over air
00:33:16.36 --> 00:33:19.40 to ground support, especially in the cities in Ramadi.
00:33:19.40 --> 00:33:22.92 It was very difficult to get bombs dropped.
00:33:22.92 --> 00:33:28.88 But you know, who had really good decentralized command was the tanks and the tanks that we
00:33:28.88 --> 00:33:33.96 worked with, they would come and they had pretty good control over what, you know, I'm
00:33:33.96 --> 00:33:35.36 talking the tank commander.
00:33:35.36 --> 00:33:36.36 Right.
00:33:36.36 --> 00:33:40.92 And at the company command level, we had some company commanders that would just get
00:33:40.92 --> 00:33:43.32 after it and they would make stuff happen.
00:33:43.32 --> 00:33:49.08 So we felt really comfortable working with the tankers and they supported us over and over
00:33:49.08 --> 00:33:53.72 and over again, really like I said, with a lot of decentralized command.
00:33:53.72 --> 00:33:57.96 You know, they couldn't, they had to use some, they obviously used discretion, but they had
00:33:57.96 --> 00:33:59.96 a lot of authority out there, which was great.
00:33:59.96 --> 00:34:02.96 Yeah, which we did as well, which was really good.
00:34:02.96 --> 00:34:06.16 So at any time, you left me, I'm going back from where we are and refueled a
00:34:06.16 --> 00:34:07.80 con team, we're heading back up.
00:34:07.80 --> 00:34:12.64 We're denied permission to deviate over to Polyclang and we're getting back into it
00:34:12.64 --> 00:34:14.80 and been at one more time.
00:34:14.80 --> 00:34:19.52 And now what you're doing, when I'm going to pick the story back up here, there's a Huey
00:34:19.52 --> 00:34:21.56 that's got recifying.
00:34:21.56 --> 00:34:25.36 So he's got, you know, bullets, probably bullets, water and food, maybe at this point,
00:34:25.36 --> 00:34:30.24 just bullets and they need to get that gear down to the guys on the ground.
00:34:30.24 --> 00:34:31.24 Right.
00:34:31.24 --> 00:34:33.60 The guys on the ground, the base had been pretty much completely overrun.
00:34:33.60 --> 00:34:38.12 The friendly said consolidated at a command bunker complex, or defensive dug-in positions
00:34:38.12 --> 00:34:41.28 at the top of the hill, which was their fire base.
00:34:41.28 --> 00:34:45.68 They were, when we got the call to cover that Huey, we were told that the guys on the ground
00:34:45.68 --> 00:34:50.08 were completely out of anti-tank ammo and were almost out of small arms ammunition and
00:34:50.08 --> 00:34:52.24 could we cover this Huey in for the receply.
00:34:52.24 --> 00:34:54.24 So here we go, back to the book.
00:34:54.24 --> 00:34:57.76 The Huey came in to a low hover near the command bunker.
00:34:57.76 --> 00:34:59.96 The crew kicked out the ammo boxes.
00:34:59.96 --> 00:35:03.56 The helicopter did a hovering turn and took off.
00:35:03.56 --> 00:35:07.88 I began a sharp left turn so I continued shooting suppressive fire for him.
00:35:07.88 --> 00:35:12.000 The enemy opened up on our two cobras with everything they had.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.40 My view left right and above and below was filled with tracers.
00:35:17.40 --> 00:35:20.84 Tim fired continuously and Tim was here.
00:35:20.84 --> 00:35:25.16 Tim was my front seat or my copilot gunner and the front seat working that nose turret
00:35:25.16 --> 00:35:26.92 while I was firing rockets.
00:35:26.92 --> 00:35:29.32 Tim fired continuously on those firing at us.
00:35:29.32 --> 00:35:32.52 We took large caliber hits all over the aircraft.
00:35:32.52 --> 00:35:38.88 Fifty ones like I talked about and 14.5mm rounds came through the cockpit.
00:35:38.88 --> 00:35:44.44 Hits from small arms always felt something like jiffy popcorn popping against its tinfoil
00:35:44.44 --> 00:35:45.84 cover.
00:35:45.84 --> 00:35:49.36 These seemed like jack hammer slamming into the aircraft.
00:35:49.36 --> 00:35:53.48 Beginning in the rear, working up the side and then into the cockpit.
00:35:53.48 --> 00:35:57.32 The tail rotor was shot off and the engine was shot up.
00:35:57.32 --> 00:36:00.04 Every system on the helicopter was damaged in some way.
00:36:00.04 --> 00:36:03.48 Throughout the tail rotor, the aircraft began to spin.
00:36:03.48 --> 00:36:05.92 Fuel lines were upshared and we were burning.
00:36:05.92 --> 00:36:07.80 I keyed the microphone.
00:36:07.80 --> 00:36:12.16 This is three-six taking fire from four o'clock, taking fire everywhere, taking fire, taking
00:36:12.16 --> 00:36:15.000 hits, going down, panther going down.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.48 The engine quit.
00:36:16.48 --> 00:36:19.04 The rotor RPM caution light flashed.
00:36:19.04 --> 00:36:24.28 The audio warning sounded announcing that my rotor blades were turning dangerously slow.
00:36:24.28 --> 00:36:27.56 I slammed the collective down hard to auto rotate.
00:36:27.56 --> 00:36:31.92 Under optimal conditions, this is a controlled emergency descent.
00:36:31.92 --> 00:36:36.96 Under these conditions, I could only hope to lessen the severity of the crash.
00:36:36.96 --> 00:36:39.24 We corkscrewed down flames.
00:36:39.24 --> 00:36:43.84 As I wrestled the aircraft, I radiowed my wingman flame.
00:36:43.84 --> 00:36:47.48 You better get in here and get us out quick.
00:36:47.48 --> 00:36:49.88 There was no answer.
00:36:49.88 --> 00:36:51.60 They were fighting for their lives.
00:36:51.60 --> 00:36:56.84 I learned years later that when I called, taking hits, flame had banked his co-brand fired
00:36:56.84 --> 00:36:59.16 rockets onto the position shooting at me.
00:36:59.16 --> 00:37:05.12 As he did so, a big ugly 51 round came through the cockpit and torrent to his chest, high
00:37:05.12 --> 00:37:06.60 on the left side.
00:37:06.60 --> 00:37:10.56 Bob took the controls and headed for help, flying from the front seat.
00:37:10.56 --> 00:37:13.56 My cobra came down spinning and burning.
00:37:13.56 --> 00:37:17.96 It hit the ground hard, nose low on the left side.
00:37:17.96 --> 00:37:22.60 It bounced back into the air, spun another turn and a half, and crashed.
00:37:22.60 --> 00:37:36.12 It settled nearly up right firing Gulf the cockpit.
00:37:36.12 --> 00:37:43.12 So pilots are known for maintaining their composure, right?
00:37:43.12 --> 00:37:45.72 I've heard pilots do it.
00:37:45.72 --> 00:37:50.000 And clearly, you know, you're saying we're taking hits, we're taking fire from everywhere.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.80 We're going down, Panther going down.
00:37:53.80 --> 00:37:59.52 Are you so tracking on control on the aircraft that you're just completely focused on
00:37:59.52 --> 00:38:07.52 that, that the rest of what's happening is a little bit blocked out or what are you
00:38:07.52 --> 00:38:08.52 think of yourself?
00:38:08.52 --> 00:38:09.96 I got to survive this crash.
00:38:09.96 --> 00:38:13.52 Are you not worried about the fact that when you get on the ground, hey, now I'm
00:38:13.52 --> 00:38:15.52 going to be surrounded by enemy?
00:38:15.52 --> 00:38:19.76 Yeah, none of those thoughts are taking place.
00:38:19.76 --> 00:38:25.04 As I said in an earlier thing that you read, everyone who's not totally insane is scared
00:38:25.04 --> 00:38:27.04 in combat.
00:38:27.04 --> 00:38:30.88 Oftentimes that fear comes about after the missions are over at the end of the day when
00:38:30.88 --> 00:38:32.88 you think back on what you'd been through that day.
00:38:32.88 --> 00:38:35.44 I think goodness, we got to drink alcohol and Vietnam.
00:38:35.44 --> 00:38:37.16 I don't know how people survive in war today.
00:38:37.16 --> 00:38:38.16 I really don't.
00:38:38.16 --> 00:38:41.88 We got drunk every single night and then went back out the next day and then did it again.
00:38:41.88 --> 00:38:43.96 So there's fear at the end of the day.
00:38:43.96 --> 00:38:49.80 There's also fear and trepidation to a degree when you first go and like when I describe
00:38:49.80 --> 00:38:52.84 coming across the hell and seeing what that battle of ban hat looked like, tracer stuff
00:38:52.84 --> 00:38:53.84 all over the place.
00:38:53.84 --> 00:38:57.24 You get butterflies in your stomach and your anxious.
00:38:57.24 --> 00:39:04.48 Once you go in on that mission and start those gun runs, there's no time, there's no mental
00:39:04.48 --> 00:39:06.48 space for any of that other thought.
00:39:06.48 --> 00:39:09.56 There's no mental space for that fear.
00:39:09.56 --> 00:39:14.68 You just focus on what you have to do and you do it and the whole thing we just read
00:39:14.68 --> 00:39:18.64 it and shot down, though still, I mean all these years later, I'm sitting here with a red
00:39:18.64 --> 00:39:22.76 emotional flush in my face, reliving this yet one more time.
00:39:22.76 --> 00:39:26.84 But no, I don't recall thinking of anything in those moments.
00:39:26.84 --> 00:39:31.40 But doing that mission, controlling that aircraft, dealing with that emergency situation
00:39:31.40 --> 00:39:34.80 is best I could and going through the whole process, I don't even think there was a thought
00:39:34.80 --> 00:39:37.88 of life or death or am I going to make it or not make it.
00:39:37.88 --> 00:39:39.60 None of that was even there.
00:39:39.60 --> 00:39:46.96 You do what you have to do and get it done and then when it all settled in and hit
00:39:46.96 --> 00:39:52.76 spun, settled in, crashed, smoke and flames everywhere, the thing begins exploding, then
00:39:52.76 --> 00:39:57.08 even then there's not time for that fear factor then because then you start dealing with,
00:39:57.08 --> 00:40:00.44 okay, what do I have to do now to survive this and get out of here?
00:40:00.44 --> 00:40:04.92 And so your aircrafts on fire and I guess you're not sitting around pondering much when
00:40:04.92 --> 00:40:08.44 your aircrafts on fire and you're stuck and they're trying to get out, you get hung up
00:40:08.44 --> 00:40:13.04 while you're getting out by the way.
00:40:13.04 --> 00:40:26.24 So you, you do get out, you make it away from the bird a little bit and you end up getting
00:40:26.24 --> 00:40:27.64 some distance away.
00:40:27.64 --> 00:40:29.24 You lost your wingman, right?
00:40:29.24 --> 00:40:32.56 Or you started, you lost your, you know, my wingman took the 51.
00:40:32.56 --> 00:40:38.16 But Tim, he got out of the aircraft too and took off in another direction.
00:40:38.16 --> 00:40:42.60 Now my front seat, Tim Connery, in a cobra there's two canopies, one for the front
00:40:42.60 --> 00:40:43.92 seat, one for the back.
00:40:43.92 --> 00:40:48.68 The front seat canopy opens to the left, the back seat canopy opens to the right.
00:40:48.68 --> 00:40:55.40 So we hit, we had an inner calm conversation, I said, I said, let's get out of this thing.
00:40:55.40 --> 00:40:57.44 That's good enough for that.
00:40:57.44 --> 00:41:02.52 And he robs at that call and then he got out his way I get out my way.
00:41:02.52 --> 00:41:05.28 I don't know if you had that little vignette of what happened when I was hanging upside
00:41:05.28 --> 00:41:06.28 down out the aircraft.
00:41:06.28 --> 00:41:07.28 Yeah, I did.
00:41:07.28 --> 00:41:09.20 I was doing one, two.
00:41:09.20 --> 00:41:12.24 Mark true hand, the idea of the visor on the ground there.
00:41:12.24 --> 00:41:14.52 I'll go ahead and if you want.
00:41:14.52 --> 00:41:18.60 Yeah, inside Ben hat, one of the American advisors Mark true hand, watch us get shot down
00:41:18.60 --> 00:41:19.60 in crash.
00:41:19.60 --> 00:41:21.16 He saw Tim exit the aircraft.
00:41:21.16 --> 00:41:25.20 He saw me hanging out of the side of the cobra, head down with my feet stuck in the
00:41:25.20 --> 00:41:27.68 cockpit, the helicopter burning.
00:41:27.68 --> 00:41:33.44 He'd seen a truck driver die in agony in a blazing semi-reck years before and it sworn
00:41:33.44 --> 00:41:36.36 he would not let that happen again.
00:41:36.36 --> 00:41:40.56 He raised the sight of his M16 rifle to my body.
00:41:40.56 --> 00:41:45.28 As he began to squeeze the trigger to put me out of my misery, a cloud of smoke billed
00:41:45.28 --> 00:41:47.52 from the exploding aircraft.
00:41:47.52 --> 00:41:50.20 It obscured me from his view.
00:41:50.20 --> 00:41:54.68 When the smoke cleared, I was gone.
00:41:54.68 --> 00:41:56.80 And that's something that you found out years later.
00:41:56.80 --> 00:42:02.40 Yeah, he got touched when I got a contact me and said, I think it was a letter.
00:42:02.40 --> 00:42:05.32 And said, I was one of the advisors on the ground at Ben hat when he got shot down.
00:42:05.32 --> 00:42:08.16 I can give you some information about what happened if you'd like to hear it.
00:42:08.16 --> 00:42:11.12 If you don't, I understand if you just don't want to even go there.
00:42:11.12 --> 00:42:12.64 I said, I'll tell me what you know.
00:42:12.64 --> 00:42:14.68 So he shared that story with me.
00:42:14.68 --> 00:42:17.28 Unbelievable.
00:42:17.28 --> 00:42:19.56 So I'm going back to the book.
00:42:19.56 --> 00:42:21.76 Your, your, this is the state you're in.
00:42:21.76 --> 00:42:23.84 The pain in my back was intense.
00:42:23.84 --> 00:42:25.16 It was broken.
00:42:25.16 --> 00:42:26.80 The fire had burned the back of my neck.
00:42:26.80 --> 00:42:28.48 I had lesser burns on my face.
00:42:28.48 --> 00:42:30.000 My hair was cinched.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.08 I had pulled a shell fragment out of my ankle.
00:42:33.08 --> 00:42:34.08 Superfistle.
00:42:34.08 --> 00:42:36.80 Last of the racians covered my face and forehead.
00:42:36.80 --> 00:42:39.000 But bleeding badly.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.68 I was a mess.
00:42:40.68 --> 00:42:42.24 But I was motivated.
00:42:42.24 --> 00:42:43.40 I wanted to get away.
00:42:43.40 --> 00:42:47.12 I staggered from the crash site and headed southeast towards quantum.
00:42:47.12 --> 00:42:48.12 Quantum.
00:42:48.12 --> 00:42:49.12 Quantum.
00:42:49.12 --> 00:42:50.92 As it was getting dark.
00:42:50.92 --> 00:42:54.68 I had not gone far when I heard helicopters approaching.
00:42:54.68 --> 00:42:57.24 The helicopters came in low shooting.
00:42:57.24 --> 00:42:59.92 And you had your little, uh, strobe.
00:42:59.92 --> 00:43:00.92 And so here we go.
00:43:00.92 --> 00:43:03.52 I held the light over my head pointed toward the aircraft.
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:05.48 It flashed a few times.
00:43:05.48 --> 00:43:08.80 The gunner and the lead cobra opened up on me with his minigun.
00:43:08.80 --> 00:43:14.04 A stream of tracers came right at me, which is, this is something we learned in Iraq as
00:43:14.04 --> 00:43:15.04 well.
00:43:15.04 --> 00:43:19.96 When you fire off a strobe, if someone isn't expecting or isn't looking for it, it just
00:43:19.96 --> 00:43:24.64 looks like muscle flash and anybody that sees it will shoot at it.
00:43:24.64 --> 00:43:28.000 We had blue covers that we put on and it supposedly changed the color of it.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.48 So it wouldn't look like enemy fire.
00:43:29.48 --> 00:43:30.48 But no.
00:43:30.48 --> 00:43:34.72 In fact, I ran into that front seat or they're open up on me years later, Bentley Hill.
00:43:34.72 --> 00:43:37.32 And yeah, he's sure he said, yeah, we were out there flying that mission.
00:43:37.32 --> 00:43:38.68 It sure looked like enemy fire.
00:43:38.68 --> 00:43:39.76 Sorry about that.
00:43:39.76 --> 00:43:46.04 So here we go back to the book.
00:43:46.04 --> 00:43:47.80 This is a little bit about your attitude.
00:43:47.80 --> 00:43:48.80 I was coxer.
00:43:48.80 --> 00:43:50.88 If anyone could survive this, it was me.
00:43:50.88 --> 00:43:52.40 I'd been a boy scout.
00:43:52.40 --> 00:43:56.24 Though I was one of the trouble makers in my troop, I'd learned a lot.
00:43:56.24 --> 00:44:01.04 I'd backpack 65 miles through the mountains in five days in practice survival skills.
00:44:01.04 --> 00:44:05.40 My troubled youth got me suspended from school a number of times, but it also taught me
00:44:05.40 --> 00:44:06.56 lessons.
00:44:06.56 --> 00:44:08.08 I learned a street fight.
00:44:08.08 --> 00:44:09.52 Take care of myself.
00:44:09.52 --> 00:44:12.84 I had boxed, played football, and run track.
00:44:12.84 --> 00:44:19.40 I majored in forestry, worked cattle ranches, road Bronx, in small rodeos, fought forest
00:44:19.40 --> 00:44:26.76 fires, worked construction, and was an electrical lineman for Southern California Edison.
00:44:26.76 --> 00:44:29.80 I remembered a little, diddy my mother had taught me.
00:44:29.80 --> 00:44:33.24 The Lord helps those who help themselves.
00:44:33.24 --> 00:44:37.48 I knew I could depend on its absolute truth to get me through this.
00:44:37.48 --> 00:44:40.52 The Lord helps those who help themselves.
00:44:40.52 --> 00:44:41.92 God, I'll do that.
00:44:41.92 --> 00:44:43.24 Do all I can.
00:44:43.24 --> 00:44:45.32 Mustard every bit of what's inside me.
00:44:45.32 --> 00:44:47.32 I'll do my part.
00:44:47.32 --> 00:44:50.08 I'll do all I can to help myself.
00:44:50.08 --> 00:44:53.32 So please, please do yours.
00:44:53.32 --> 00:44:55.08 I need your help.
00:44:55.08 --> 00:44:59.20 I set it again to myself, drawing comfort and strength.
00:44:59.20 --> 00:45:02.36 The Lord helps those who help themselves.
00:45:02.36 --> 00:45:12.36 I would repeat it often, as I set my mind to doing all I must to survive.
00:45:12.36 --> 00:45:22.12 This is interesting going through this and all this detail again, because when I wrote
00:45:22.12 --> 00:45:27.64 the book, I had to revisit everything in detail, like I had not done since it happened to
00:45:27.64 --> 00:45:28.64 me.
00:45:28.64 --> 00:45:32.44 I had never gone to this depth of reliving those experiences.
00:45:32.44 --> 00:45:37.84 It's tough to think back on that.
00:45:37.84 --> 00:45:41.76 Indeed when I was writing this, I'd share some of the writing with my wife on account
00:45:41.76 --> 00:45:45.12 to bed late at night and after I got a few chapters into this, I told her, when I said,
00:45:45.12 --> 00:45:46.12 I'm only what am I doing?
00:45:46.12 --> 00:45:50.44 This whole thing is a series of unfortunate events who's going to want to read something
00:45:50.44 --> 00:45:51.44 like this.
00:45:51.44 --> 00:45:53.96 And she told me, I know the whole story.
00:45:53.96 --> 00:45:59.16 She said, stick with it, finish this book because I think that in it there is inspiration,
00:45:59.16 --> 00:46:00.96 there's motivation for people.
00:46:00.96 --> 00:46:02.84 It's not just your story.
00:46:02.84 --> 00:46:05.08 It can help others.
00:46:05.08 --> 00:46:10.20 And so in that vein, I say that because it is getting a little emotional as we read through
00:46:10.20 --> 00:46:11.72 this and that's fine.
00:46:11.72 --> 00:46:16.20 But I do hope that some of this is useful and helpful for others.
00:46:16.20 --> 00:46:23.32 And I grew up going to church as a kid, but I wasn't overly religious guy and somewhere
00:46:23.32 --> 00:46:26.04 around college, I quit going to church altogether.
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:29.44 And in the army, the only time I can remember that I'd been going to church was from Memorial
00:46:29.44 --> 00:46:32.24 Services for guys and that was about it.
00:46:32.24 --> 00:46:38.000 But if you end up in a situation like this, or I would say any, really, if you think the
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.92 situation in your life is stressful and is about to overwhelm you, you need some help
00:46:42.92 --> 00:46:44.64 beyond yourself.
00:46:44.64 --> 00:46:49.72 And no matter what you're not selling any religion, but I would say whatever your religious
00:46:49.72 --> 00:46:56.76 beliefs are, you can find a lot of strength in your God and get close to God and he'll
00:46:56.76 --> 00:46:57.76 help you through it.
00:46:57.76 --> 00:47:00.16 And certainly I couldn't have done this by myself.
00:47:00.16 --> 00:47:02.36 I grabbed a whole of that ditty that my mom gave me.
00:47:02.36 --> 00:47:07.24 I also grabbed a whole to the 23rd Psalm and when stuff got really close to being blown
00:47:07.24 --> 00:47:11.76 to smithereens a few times later on in my captivity, that 23rd Psalm was going over and
00:47:11.76 --> 00:47:13.16 over again in my mind too.
00:47:13.16 --> 00:47:17.20 So yeah, again, not selling any religion, but whatever your spirituality is, you'd best
00:47:17.20 --> 00:47:21.68 get comfortable with it if you're going to be in dire straits like this.
00:47:21.68 --> 00:47:28.36 And it's interesting that you're saying, look, I'm going to do everything I can, but
00:47:28.36 --> 00:47:29.36 I'm needs help.
00:47:29.36 --> 00:47:30.36 Yep.
00:47:30.36 --> 00:47:31.36 Yep.
00:47:31.36 --> 00:47:36.84 And you know, certainly, you know, when you say that other people, you know, will
00:47:36.84 --> 00:47:41.84 be able to find absolutely, I mean, just me reading this, I found all kinds of not just
00:47:41.84 --> 00:47:46.04 inspiration, but practical guidance, which, you know, one of the things you just said is
00:47:46.04 --> 00:47:50.76 practical guidance on, you know, someone that's been through what you've been through, there's
00:47:50.76 --> 00:47:54.76 so much that everybody else can take away and learn from.
00:47:54.76 --> 00:47:59.28 And yeah, that's, that's one of them right there.
00:47:59.28 --> 00:48:05.12 Do what you can, do everything that you can, and then have some faith on the things that
00:48:05.12 --> 00:48:07.60 you can't control are going to work out your way.
00:48:07.60 --> 00:48:10.88 Yeah, and I think that's important too, because I'm thinking now as we're talking, and I don't
00:48:10.88 --> 00:48:14.28 know if we're going to get to that specific part in the book or not.
00:48:14.28 --> 00:48:18.40 But early on, I think it was the first night, I get B52 strikes almost landing on top
00:48:18.40 --> 00:48:19.40 of me.
00:48:19.40 --> 00:48:23.72 And I'm beginning to feel that am I going to survive this or not?
00:48:23.72 --> 00:48:29.12 And I think the answer is, I don't know, but in that answer is, I don't know.
00:48:29.12 --> 00:48:30.12 And so what?
00:48:30.12 --> 00:48:31.12 I mean, that doesn't matter.
00:48:31.12 --> 00:48:32.12 That's not important.
00:48:32.12 --> 00:48:33.12 I may survive.
00:48:33.12 --> 00:48:35.96 If I'm going to do all I can to survive.
00:48:35.96 --> 00:48:42.44 So I got to the point where this fear of being blown to smithereens kind of went away.
00:48:42.44 --> 00:48:46.36 And I just settled into, I'll either survive or I won't survive.
00:48:46.36 --> 00:48:47.64 But I can't worry about that.
00:48:47.64 --> 00:48:52.96 All I can worry about is what can I do to try and set the best conditions to make that
00:48:52.96 --> 00:48:53.96 survival possible?
00:48:53.96 --> 00:48:56.000 And if I either will or I won't.
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.40 You know, one of the similar things that I always felt was, you know, when I rack
00:49:00.40 --> 00:49:08.40 one of the biggest threats to us was IEDs and they're random.
00:49:08.40 --> 00:49:11.000 They're going to hit you or they're not going to hit you.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.44 And when you every time you go outside the wire, there's a chance that it's your day.
00:49:17.44 --> 00:49:23.000 And you know, kind of what I told my guys and the way I felt myself was, okay, I know
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.76 they're out there.
00:49:24.76 --> 00:49:26.96 We've done everything we can to mitigate the risk.
00:49:26.96 --> 00:49:27.96 We've done our planning.
00:49:27.96 --> 00:49:32.40 We've done our drills. We've gathered our intelligence. There's nothing else we can do
00:49:32.40 --> 00:49:34.72 to control it. So I'm not going to worry about it.
00:49:34.72 --> 00:49:36.72 Right. And I've done everything I can.
00:49:36.72 --> 00:49:40.08 But like you said, I've helped myself as much as I can.
00:49:40.08 --> 00:49:42.20 And then after that, it's out of my hands.
00:49:42.20 --> 00:49:47.16 And in the more you worry about it, like you said, well, does it really matter?
00:49:47.16 --> 00:49:48.24 I continue to worry about it.
00:49:48.24 --> 00:49:50.20 But doesn't matter.
00:49:50.20 --> 00:49:50.68 Got it.
00:49:50.68 --> 00:49:51.72 Got to move forward.
00:49:51.72 --> 00:49:52.72 Exactly.
00:49:52.72 --> 00:50:01.52 Here's, you do a couple days, three days worth of a vision of the enemy.
00:50:01.52 --> 00:50:05.000 And now you're out hiding.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000 You hear some voices.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.84 You crouch down.
00:50:07.84 --> 00:50:08.84 You're hiding.
00:50:08.84 --> 00:50:10.48 You know there are people.
00:50:10.48 --> 00:50:11.84 And here we go back to the book.
00:50:11.84 --> 00:50:14.68 A lot of crashing around came from the direction of the voices.
00:50:14.68 --> 00:50:20.96 I looked up and saw uniformed NVA soldiers pointing AK47 rifles at my head.
00:50:20.96 --> 00:50:23.20 They shriek something in motion for me to stand up.
00:50:23.20 --> 00:50:24.60 I did.
00:50:24.60 --> 00:50:26.56 I was captured.
00:50:26.56 --> 00:50:32.28 I felt indescribably sick in the pit of my stomach as the world fell away.
00:50:32.28 --> 00:50:35.16 I'd been struggling for three days to stay alive.
00:50:35.16 --> 00:50:37.76 I was in miserable shape.
00:50:37.76 --> 00:50:39.24 But I had been free.
00:50:39.24 --> 00:50:41.12 And I had options.
00:50:41.12 --> 00:50:42.84 No more.
00:50:42.84 --> 00:50:45.12 My soul was awashed with anguish.
00:50:45.12 --> 00:50:47.08 I was no longer a free man.
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:52.48 In that instant, I'd become a captive of the communist North Vietnamese Army, a prisoner
00:50:52.48 --> 00:50:58.60 of war, another American POW, and the long Vietnam conflict.
00:50:58.60 --> 00:51:02.92 I had no idea how long they might let me live.
00:51:02.92 --> 00:51:09.000 Or, if I was about to die.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.40 A couple of them were shaking.
00:51:11.40 --> 00:51:13.64 We stood in utter silence for a moment.
00:51:13.64 --> 00:51:14.64 They glared at me.
00:51:14.64 --> 00:51:15.96 I glared at them.
00:51:15.96 --> 00:51:20.16 So that tense instant, I didn't know if I'd be riddled with bullets or be allowed
00:51:20.16 --> 00:51:21.16 to live.
00:51:21.16 --> 00:51:23.76 One barked something at me I could not understand.
00:51:23.76 --> 00:51:28.28 Another joined in, then a third, I looked right into their eyes.
00:51:28.28 --> 00:51:29.88 I was an American.
00:51:29.88 --> 00:51:39.32 I would show them the best American fighting man that I could.
00:51:39.32 --> 00:51:44.28 In the pit of full state that I was in, you know, that's the best I could do on
00:51:44.28 --> 00:51:46.32 describing capture.
00:51:46.32 --> 00:51:52.000 It's impossible to really convey the full feeling of losing your freedom and being
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000 a captive.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.32 It's just indescribable.
00:51:55.32 --> 00:51:58.56 But I did the best that I could.
00:51:58.56 --> 00:51:59.88 I was in miserable shape.
00:51:59.88 --> 00:52:01.88 I mean, you read about the wounds that I had.
00:52:01.88 --> 00:52:08.60 In addition to those, I'd picked up some leeches that I'd been plucking off on my body.
00:52:08.60 --> 00:52:10.24 My face was covered with blood.
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:13.60 My three-day growth, the heavy beard was sticking through.
00:52:13.60 --> 00:52:17.76 This is my back injuries that I didn't even know that I got released and I had badly broken
00:52:17.76 --> 00:52:18.76 my back.
00:52:18.76 --> 00:52:21.96 I had no control of my bowels or bladder for those three days.
00:52:21.96 --> 00:52:31.12 I smelled, I was just an awful mess when those guys captured me and took me up that hill.
00:52:31.12 --> 00:52:37.92 They finally get you to sort of like a camp, sort of the first interrogation camp.
00:52:37.92 --> 00:52:40.28 Yeah, well, they captured me the jungle.
00:52:40.28 --> 00:52:45.24 So thick, they were only a few yards away when I stumbled upon them and they had been
00:52:45.24 --> 00:52:47.08 down to the stream, filling canteens.
00:52:47.08 --> 00:52:49.60 These five young guys captured me.
00:52:49.60 --> 00:52:54.68 They took me almost an equal distance up a hill opposite and I came into an open area.
00:52:54.68 --> 00:52:57.68 Still had the canopy of the triple canopy jungle.
00:52:57.68 --> 00:52:58.68 But the bottom was all open.
00:52:58.68 --> 00:53:02.60 There are hundreds of North Vietnamese soldiers, supplies, defensive positions.
00:53:02.60 --> 00:53:04.80 This was a major staging area for this battle.
00:53:04.80 --> 00:53:05.80 It was taking place.
00:53:05.80 --> 00:53:10.12 As I was trying to get away from the battle and get towards cont too, my stumbled right
00:53:10.12 --> 00:53:13.44 into their staging area.
00:53:13.44 --> 00:53:19.24 And you start getting your, you know, start getting the soft interrogation is what I put
00:53:19.24 --> 00:53:20.24 down here.
00:53:20.24 --> 00:53:25.88 A guy says, you know, we found pictures of a pretty lady with your children in your wallet,
00:53:25.88 --> 00:53:28.40 obviously your family.
00:53:28.40 --> 00:53:33.000 And you say, yeah, I know you miss them and are very worried and they're very worried
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.92 about you, you follow the rules and you will be home soon.
00:53:36.92 --> 00:53:40.24 You'll receive humane and lenient treatment.
00:53:40.24 --> 00:53:43.08 You will be allowed to go home.
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:48.18 And I put that in there because that's a refrain that we hear quite a bit humane and lenient
00:53:48.18 --> 00:53:50.18 that was a refrain.
00:53:50.18 --> 00:53:54.76 They would say it all the time and during my whole captivity, you do what you're supposed
00:53:54.76 --> 00:53:55.76 to do and cooperate.
00:53:55.76 --> 00:53:57.24 You get the humane and lenient treatment.
00:53:57.24 --> 00:54:04.28 Of course, you weren't fully cooperative at all with them and what they were asking you.
00:54:04.28 --> 00:54:07.56 So they went from that idea.
00:54:07.56 --> 00:54:10.56 So they started stepping it up on you and you know, here's an example of the things that
00:54:10.56 --> 00:54:15.84 they said, you are a war criminal and the Geneva agreements do not apply to you.
00:54:15.84 --> 00:54:21.08 You have no rights, but we will still give you the deserved humane and lenient treatment.
00:54:21.08 --> 00:54:25.000 All you have to do is cooperate with us and acknowledge your crimes.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000 Yep.
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.84 You know, I think it was back to your reading of the Code of Conduct that started this
00:54:30.84 --> 00:54:33.56 off to our Code of Conduct was different.
00:54:33.56 --> 00:54:34.56 Right.
00:54:34.56 --> 00:54:40.000 It said we were bound to give only our name rank service number and data birth and the way
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.92 that was taught and the way we understood it.
00:54:41.92 --> 00:54:46.08 That was all we could give was name rank service number, data birth and if we gave anything
00:54:46.08 --> 00:54:51.32 else we had we had caved in and we're cooperating with the enemy.
00:54:51.32 --> 00:54:55.32 So that was my stance that was all I was going to give them was my name rank service
00:54:55.32 --> 00:54:56.88 number, data birth.
00:54:56.88 --> 00:54:59.64 You may get into some of the things that took place.
00:54:59.64 --> 00:55:03.96 I would just like to comment that there was nothing heroic going on at all.
00:55:03.96 --> 00:55:05.68 I guess a couple of things that were going on.
00:55:05.68 --> 00:55:10.48 I was trying to abide by the Code of Conduct and I was in a state where I had been near
00:55:10.48 --> 00:55:17.12 death for days, was very near death at that moment and was numb and just almost didn't
00:55:17.12 --> 00:55:18.12 care.
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:21.88 I was hard to understand and believe but almost didn't care at that point and then I got
00:55:21.88 --> 00:55:26.96 so angry and aggravated with this son of a bitch that ended up being my interrogator from
00:55:26.96 --> 00:55:31.06 his initial soft cell as you said but his first words he showed up he's only got
00:55:31.06 --> 00:55:32.06 spoken anglicence.
00:55:32.06 --> 00:55:37.000 I was captured so I asked myself myself, my condition if I was hurt and so I opened up
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.80 with him about some of that but then when he got into what was clearly an interrogation
00:55:41.80 --> 00:55:43.68 then I clamped up.
00:55:43.68 --> 00:55:50.12 I would close these comments now with the fact that he didn't break me and that interrogation
00:55:50.12 --> 00:55:57.12 speaks nothing to my heroism or ability to resist interrogation anyone can be broken.
00:55:57.12 --> 00:56:03.68 If this would have continued over time I'm sure that he could have got me to do something
00:56:03.68 --> 00:56:07.72 with his brutality probably nothing that would have given him any useful intelligence but
00:56:07.72 --> 00:56:10.36 he might have got me to do something.
00:56:10.36 --> 00:56:15.64 So for that for those moments on those days of that initial interrogation I was able
00:56:15.64 --> 00:56:19.04 to stick with my name rank service number data worth.
00:56:19.04 --> 00:56:27.28 Here's an example of that is back the book here please sign this.
00:56:27.28 --> 00:56:29.48 He handed me one of the sheets of paper in a pen.
00:56:29.48 --> 00:56:33.92 I looked at the paper it was typed in English as I began to read the words my interrogator
00:56:33.92 --> 00:56:38.24 interrupted this is simply a form that acknowledges your status we need it so we can
00:56:38.24 --> 00:56:43.76 begin to process you for release so we can send word to your family of your status please
00:56:43.76 --> 00:56:44.76 just sign.
00:56:44.76 --> 00:56:47.92 I read the words I could not believe what I was reading.
00:56:47.92 --> 00:56:51.80 There was a blank face place for me to fill in my name.
00:56:51.80 --> 00:56:55.66 The text said that I was an American war criminal who had been conducting illegal
00:56:55.66 --> 00:57:01.44 acts against the Vietnamese people including bioside genocide and eco-side.
00:57:01.44 --> 00:57:03.76 I had dropped fire bombs and chemical bombs.
00:57:03.76 --> 00:57:07.28 I had killed old men, pregnant women and babies.
00:57:07.28 --> 00:57:12.28 Bioside genocide, eco-side, what a bunch of crap.
00:57:12.28 --> 00:57:14.80 I raised my head and looked into his eyes.
00:57:14.80 --> 00:57:18.52 And no, I will not sign this.
00:57:18.52 --> 00:57:20.56 There I had spoken, you must.
00:57:20.56 --> 00:57:22.000 I will not.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.76 His agitation returned now, you must.
00:57:24.76 --> 00:57:26.20 I glared at him.
00:57:26.20 --> 00:57:27.56 He got up and came at me.
00:57:27.56 --> 00:57:29.04 He smacked me across the face.
00:57:29.04 --> 00:57:30.72 You must.
00:57:30.72 --> 00:57:35.04 He turned to his sidekick and spoke quietly and the man got up.
00:57:35.04 --> 00:57:40.80 At his direction two guards dragged me up against a tree, a broad trunk of a tree.
00:57:40.80 --> 00:57:44.28 I've been bent over since the crash unable to stand erect.
00:57:44.28 --> 00:57:48.20 He forced me up and to a straight sitting position and tied me to the tree.
00:57:48.20 --> 00:57:49.64 It hurt like hell.
00:57:49.64 --> 00:57:52.76 I couldn't keep my face from contorting in anguish.
00:57:52.76 --> 00:57:54.48 Now you sign.
00:57:54.48 --> 00:57:56.12 No.
00:57:56.12 --> 00:57:57.12 More orders.
00:57:57.12 --> 00:58:00.76 They pulled on the ropes to bring my arms closer together behind me.
00:58:00.76 --> 00:58:03.20 The pain in my back increased.
00:58:03.20 --> 00:58:06.20 New pain was introduced in my shoulder joints.
00:58:06.20 --> 00:58:07.92 More demands to sign.
00:58:07.92 --> 00:58:09.52 More refusals.
00:58:09.52 --> 00:58:11.04 The ropes tightened further.
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:13.32 They moved my elbows closer together.
00:58:13.32 --> 00:58:14.32 More demands.
00:58:14.32 --> 00:58:15.68 More refusals.
00:58:15.68 --> 00:58:16.96 ropes ever tighter.
00:58:16.96 --> 00:58:18.96 More pain.
00:58:18.96 --> 00:58:22.52 I was uncontrollably grimacing and cursing.
00:58:22.52 --> 00:58:24.92 I would not sign.
00:58:24.92 --> 00:58:28.20 I could never consider signing anything like that.
00:58:28.20 --> 00:58:33.92 The brutality made me angrier and more firmly set against giving in.
00:58:33.92 --> 00:58:36.20 I could have been broken and made to sign eventually.
00:58:36.20 --> 00:58:37.36 There's no doubt.
00:58:37.36 --> 00:58:39.32 No man can resist forever.
00:58:39.32 --> 00:58:45.88 But this interrogator would not bring me to breaking point on that day.
00:58:45.88 --> 00:58:49.16 His demands continued and so did my refusals.
00:58:49.16 --> 00:58:51.08 The ropes tightened more and more.
00:58:51.08 --> 00:58:52.52 Pain screamed through me.
00:58:52.52 --> 00:58:55.64 My anger swelled against this asshole.
00:58:55.64 --> 00:58:59.56 I began grunting and audible attack against the agony.
00:58:59.56 --> 00:59:05.16 The guards gave the ropes one huge last pull which brought my elbows together behind me.
00:59:05.16 --> 00:59:08.60 I felt the pop as each shoulder dislocated.
00:59:08.60 --> 00:59:14.32 I leaned my knee and shot through my torso up my neck into my head and down my back through
00:59:14.32 --> 00:59:17.52 my groin and into my thighs.
00:59:17.52 --> 00:59:19.32 I've never felt such pain.
00:59:19.32 --> 00:59:23.16 My vision narrowed and I nearly passed out.
00:59:23.16 --> 00:59:25.64 Sign.
00:59:25.64 --> 00:59:28.36 I could only groan and shake my head.
00:59:28.36 --> 00:59:39.04 The interrogator scald angrily turned and left.
00:59:39.04 --> 00:59:45.08 I'm going to continue on.
00:59:45.08 --> 00:59:49.48 This is a little bit further on.
00:59:49.48 --> 00:59:57.32 He's given you one last chance to sign this paper.
00:59:57.32 --> 00:59:59.04 One last chance to cooperate.
00:59:59.04 --> 01:00:00.04 Will you?
01:00:00.04 --> 01:00:02.16 I'm going back to the book now.
01:00:02.16 --> 01:00:06.44 My head hung down partly in exhaustion and partly in an intentional rudeness, not paying
01:00:06.44 --> 01:00:08.16 in him any attention.
01:00:08.16 --> 01:00:09.68 I looked up when he finished.
01:00:09.68 --> 01:00:14.48 I saw his sadistic minion standing a few yards in front of me holding an AK-47 at the
01:00:14.48 --> 01:00:15.96 ready.
01:00:15.96 --> 01:00:19.08 Your last chance.
01:00:19.08 --> 01:00:22.52 The assistant raised the rifle and pointed at me.
01:00:22.52 --> 01:00:25.76 I stared ahead and said nothing.
01:00:25.76 --> 01:00:28.04 No heroism was involved.
01:00:28.04 --> 01:00:32.52 I was wrung out at the end of everything I had to give.
01:00:32.52 --> 01:00:39.56 I'd been so close to death for so long, was so angry and so absolutely drained.
01:00:39.56 --> 01:00:42.48 A faint spark was all I had left.
01:00:42.48 --> 01:00:46.52 I felt numb, detached from what was happening.
01:00:46.52 --> 01:00:47.92 I was not resisting.
01:00:47.92 --> 01:00:52.44 I was just giving into the flow of whatever was destined to be.
01:00:52.44 --> 01:00:54.24 That might be death.
01:00:54.24 --> 01:00:56.40 It might not.
01:00:56.40 --> 01:01:01.08 I'd seen army training film and army training film years before showing the mock execution
01:01:01.08 --> 01:01:04.24 of a Korean war, POW.
01:01:04.24 --> 01:01:05.92 I remembered that scene.
01:01:05.92 --> 01:01:08.88 The action of the trigger being pulled when over and over in my mind.
01:01:08.88 --> 01:01:11.52 Click, click, click.
01:01:11.52 --> 01:01:12.52 BAN!
01:01:12.52 --> 01:01:17.68 I flinched as a soldier jerked the trigger back, but nothing happened.
01:01:17.68 --> 01:01:18.96 No shot.
01:01:18.96 --> 01:01:20.68 No loud bang.
01:01:20.68 --> 01:01:23.60 No bullet ripping my skull or chest.
01:01:23.60 --> 01:01:25.60 Nothing.
01:01:25.60 --> 01:01:27.72 The soldier laughed.
01:01:27.72 --> 01:01:30.48 My interrogator smiled.
01:01:30.48 --> 01:01:32.64 I am done with you.
01:01:32.64 --> 01:01:35.28 You will be taken away from here.
01:01:35.28 --> 01:01:42.64 That was three days of this three horrible days.
01:01:42.64 --> 01:01:49.80 Losing my freedom, going through that interrogation, being thrown down into a pit at
01:01:49.80 --> 01:01:54.32 night where I stayed, it was one of the old abandoned bunkers who had about six inches of mud
01:01:54.32 --> 01:01:58.36 and goo in the bottom.
01:01:58.36 --> 01:02:00.72 That caused me a big psychological issue.
01:02:00.72 --> 01:02:05.58 First night closed in that darkness that night I really had to fight to just keep my
01:02:05.58 --> 01:02:06.88 cool down there.
01:02:06.88 --> 01:02:08.88 I went to a bunch of there.
01:02:08.88 --> 01:02:11.08 There were sent upheats and spiders and rats.
01:02:11.08 --> 01:02:12.08 It was a mess.
01:02:12.08 --> 01:02:15.32 I'd spend the night down there and come up in the daytime for interrogation back down
01:02:15.32 --> 01:02:16.32 in that hole.
01:02:16.32 --> 01:02:18.08 Night back up for interrogation.
01:02:18.08 --> 01:02:23.76 What we read covered a period of three days before we finally gave up on me.
01:02:23.76 --> 01:02:26.000 I had no idea what was going to happen.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.80 I just had even thinking back on it.
01:02:27.80 --> 01:02:36.000 It was just going through all that pretty much in just a numb state with that treatment.
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.04 My shoulders today still caused me problems.
01:02:38.04 --> 01:02:41.68 I had a son that ended up playing football for University of Washington many years ago.
01:02:41.68 --> 01:02:44.52 He's going to turn 50 years in April.
01:02:44.52 --> 01:02:46.04 This was a number of years ago.
01:02:46.04 --> 01:02:49.12 I used to go like I'd throw about two passes and that was it for my shoulders.
01:02:49.12 --> 01:02:53.04 Can't play horses or anything.
01:02:53.04 --> 01:02:54.76 Yeah.
01:02:54.76 --> 01:03:03.08 It's something that definitely I've experienced doing these readings.
01:03:03.08 --> 01:03:08.96 I've talked about it before that when I read something in my head and it kind of
01:03:08.96 --> 01:03:11.36 I go all the way, that's powerful.
01:03:11.36 --> 01:03:15.96 Then when you read it aloud and you hear it, it's just, it's a
01:03:15.96 --> 01:03:16.96 even more.
01:03:16.96 --> 01:03:21.32 It's the same thing with I know I sent you Jody Middix, the podcast with Jody Middix.
01:03:21.32 --> 01:03:23.20 He said the same thing.
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:31.08 He said to me, when you're reading it, it's like I'm hearing my own thoughts or something.
01:03:31.08 --> 01:03:35.48 It just brought him back.
01:03:35.48 --> 01:03:37.48 There's something about that.
01:03:37.48 --> 01:03:38.48 It's okay.
01:03:38.48 --> 01:03:43.60 When you're reading it, it's detached from reality.
01:03:43.60 --> 01:03:48.16 It's one step further detached from reality and obviously sitting with Jody sitting
01:03:48.16 --> 01:03:52.20 here with you and knowing that this is you.
01:03:52.20 --> 01:03:57.96 One point that I make all the time when I cover these historical books, I always remind
01:03:57.96 --> 01:04:01.52 people that because people in this day and age were used to seeing movies.
01:04:01.52 --> 01:04:03.68 We're used to seeing watching TV.
01:04:03.68 --> 01:04:06.72 And I always say that this guy that I'm talking about, this is a person.
01:04:06.72 --> 01:04:08.96 This guy in World War II, this is a person.
01:04:08.96 --> 01:04:12.12 This guy in World War I, this is a man.
01:04:12.12 --> 01:04:17.12 So to have you sitting here knowing that this is you.
01:04:17.12 --> 01:04:22.44 It's, I don't even know what that's stated describe it.
01:04:22.44 --> 01:04:23.60 Well, thanks, Jocco.
01:04:23.60 --> 01:04:28.72 And this has become an emotional experience for me, but it's important.
01:04:28.72 --> 01:04:31.80 And I think this is going to be an important podcast.
01:04:31.80 --> 01:04:32.80 I wrote that book.
01:04:32.80 --> 01:04:33.80 I finished it.
01:04:33.80 --> 01:04:36.40 It was published last April.
01:04:36.40 --> 01:04:39.88 I'm not read that book since it was published.
01:04:39.88 --> 01:04:44.36 I mean, it was something to go through and we live all that to get it written.
01:04:44.36 --> 01:04:46.20 And so it's been almost a year.
01:04:46.20 --> 01:04:47.56 I haven't read the book.
01:04:47.56 --> 01:04:50.24 So we're going into, into, into detail.
01:04:50.24 --> 01:04:56.000 But this is, this is good.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.36 So you get turned over to some other, some other guards.
01:05:02.36 --> 01:05:03.36 Right.
01:05:03.36 --> 01:05:05.36 And they start taking you, don't walk.
01:05:05.36 --> 01:05:07.36 Yeah, you're walking.
01:05:07.36 --> 01:05:10.12 It's just somewhere else.
01:05:10.12 --> 01:05:11.12 You talked about the conditioning.
01:05:11.12 --> 01:05:14.12 By the way, you have a broken cross vertebra at this point, right?
01:05:14.12 --> 01:05:16.92 Yeah, it's a badly broken back.
01:05:16.92 --> 01:05:19.88 One vertebra is about completely gross damage to two other vertebra.
01:05:19.88 --> 01:05:20.88 Your legs swollen.
01:05:20.88 --> 01:05:21.88 You got all kinds of you.
01:05:21.88 --> 01:05:23.52 And now you're now you got to walk.
01:05:23.52 --> 01:05:27.76 And so I'm going to go with, yeah, they gave me my boots back after those three days
01:05:27.76 --> 01:05:28.76 of interrogation.
01:05:28.76 --> 01:05:31.08 No socks, no laces, boots, bare feet.
01:05:31.08 --> 01:05:33.60 Okay, go ahead.
01:05:33.60 --> 01:05:39.76 We had an old Vietnam seal when I got to see old T-1 in 1990 and he would run barefoot all
01:05:39.76 --> 01:05:41.76 the time.
01:05:41.76 --> 01:05:47.40 And, you know, one day was, hey, hey sir, why are you, you know, why are you run barefoot?
01:05:47.40 --> 01:05:51.20 And he says, the first thing that it goes to, take your shoes, got to have hard feet.
01:05:51.20 --> 01:05:53.88 I was like, okay, okay, so I'm running barefoot now.
01:05:53.88 --> 01:05:59.04 I was thinking, because when I showed up at C-1, I always joke about this, I thought
01:05:59.04 --> 01:06:01.80 I was going to the Vietnam War in 1991 when I got there.
01:06:01.80 --> 01:06:03.48 I thought, I'm going to Vietnam now.
01:06:03.48 --> 01:06:09.16 You know, I was that, how you were, but I was a little off, you know, historically.
01:06:09.16 --> 01:06:12.16 So that's the situation you're going back to the book.
01:06:12.16 --> 01:06:14.92 They've been saying a phrase, so as you're marching with these guys, they've been saying
01:06:14.92 --> 01:06:16.96 a phrase for the past two days that I couldn't understand.
01:06:16.96 --> 01:06:19.12 I thought it was Vietnamese.
01:06:19.12 --> 01:06:21.32 Gokkukadai.
01:06:21.32 --> 01:06:27.20 As we pushed up the road, they walked behind me poking the rifle barrels into my kidneys,
01:06:27.20 --> 01:06:30.16 my ribs, shouting with increasing urgency.
01:06:30.16 --> 01:06:31.16 Gokkukadai.
01:06:31.16 --> 01:06:33.16 Gokkukadai.
01:06:33.16 --> 01:06:37.68 Then after a while, for the first time, I understood what they were saying.
01:06:37.68 --> 01:06:39.84 Gokkuk or Dai.
01:06:39.84 --> 01:06:42.28 They had been taught one short phrase in English.
01:06:42.28 --> 01:06:46.32 It was all they knew, and they had pronounced it so poorly that it took me two days to
01:06:46.32 --> 01:06:48.04 figure it out.
01:06:48.04 --> 01:06:52.76 I moved as fast as I could, but I was at the end of everything I had.
01:06:52.76 --> 01:06:53.76 I struggled on.
01:06:53.76 --> 01:06:58.16 And you know, I'm just noticing this.
01:06:58.16 --> 01:07:00.80 You're going to reach the end of everything you had.
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:02.12 You already were there.
01:07:02.12 --> 01:07:03.12 Many times.
01:07:03.12 --> 01:07:04.12 Reach the end.
01:07:04.12 --> 01:07:05.12 You just reached it.
01:07:05.12 --> 01:07:07.12 It's incredible.
01:07:07.12 --> 01:07:10.88 That's an amazing thing about human beings.
01:07:10.88 --> 01:07:15.96 We have inside that we can dig down and grab a hold of when we have to, that we don't
01:07:15.96 --> 01:07:17.56 think we ever could have done it.
01:07:17.56 --> 01:07:18.56 It's there.
01:07:18.56 --> 01:07:21.92 Can hear something that helped you.
01:07:21.92 --> 01:07:26.84 Back to the book, I found myself mentally reciting what I could recall of the 23rd
01:07:26.84 --> 01:07:27.84 Psalm.
01:07:27.84 --> 01:07:31.68 I repeated one line over and over in my head.
01:07:31.68 --> 01:07:37.44 Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for
01:07:37.44 --> 01:07:40.60 that I won't with me.
01:07:40.60 --> 01:07:46.48 That wasn't the only time during my captivity that the 23rd Psalm came to my lips.
01:07:46.48 --> 01:07:54.20 Nope.
01:07:54.20 --> 01:08:02.16 And please forgive me for like I already covered three days of misery.
01:08:02.16 --> 01:08:07.80 Now we're talking about, and I'm doing it in three minutes.
01:08:07.80 --> 01:08:12.000 Now you've walked for multiple days, suffering the whole time, and I'm going to fast forward
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000 through it.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.28 And I'm sorry.
01:08:15.28 --> 01:08:18.08 And that's why people didn't agree with us.
01:08:18.08 --> 01:08:20.08 But I didn't agree with you.
01:08:20.08 --> 01:08:21.08 That's all there.
01:08:21.08 --> 01:08:23.80 So you arrive at a camp now.
01:08:23.80 --> 01:08:25.60 You arrived back to the book.
01:08:25.60 --> 01:08:27.72 We stopped in front of one cage in the door opened.
01:08:27.72 --> 01:08:31.60 A guard pushed me in and I stumbled over someone lying inside and fell, tumbling into
01:08:31.60 --> 01:08:34.32 the ground, pain shot through me.
01:08:34.32 --> 01:08:40.32 The cage was about 12 feet wide and 20 feet or so long.
01:08:40.32 --> 01:08:42.88 It could not have been more than four feet high.
01:08:42.88 --> 01:08:48.12 26 prisoners were stuffed inside all South Vietnamese soldiers.
01:08:48.12 --> 01:08:50.80 Heat hung in the cage, heavy and stale.
01:08:50.80 --> 01:08:53.68 The air smelled of filth and putrid wounds.
01:08:53.68 --> 01:08:56.84 People moaned in a constant dull rumble.
01:08:56.84 --> 01:09:02.56 The occasion of whale was met with sharp, shushes, and guard, guarded whispers.
01:09:02.56 --> 01:09:04.80 The doorway was shut and secured.
01:09:04.80 --> 01:09:06.12 I lay there.
01:09:06.12 --> 01:09:09.56 Thankful I'd survive the journey of the past three days.
01:09:09.56 --> 01:09:12.04 What would become of me now?
01:09:12.04 --> 01:09:18.16 Yeah, that was my first prison camp.
01:09:18.16 --> 01:09:21.000 The jungle camp was in the jungle.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.56 I figured somewhere northern Cambodia where the US was not pretty anymore.
01:09:25.56 --> 01:09:30.000 It was a camp of many cages, about 300 prisoners in that camp.
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.16 All South Vietnamese, bit of encapsulated in this offensive.
01:09:33.16 --> 01:09:40.12 One other American who I would meet later and put one of those cages.
01:09:40.12 --> 01:09:41.12 Back to the book.
01:09:41.12 --> 01:09:44.12 My broken back screamed every time I tried to lay down.
01:09:44.12 --> 01:09:47.68 I tried to lie down with my feet in the stocks.
01:09:47.68 --> 01:09:51.56 So they'd put your feet into stocks, wooden bamboo stocks.
01:09:51.56 --> 01:09:54.000 There was no way I could lay on my side.
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.36 I couldn't lay straight back so I sat upright in the dark in agony.
01:09:59.36 --> 01:10:04.64 I thought of my family, thought of my day of where I'd been, where I was now, and what
01:10:04.64 --> 01:10:06.92 my lie ahead.
01:10:06.92 --> 01:10:08.20 I heard badly.
01:10:08.20 --> 01:10:11.12 Still, I had hope.
01:10:11.12 --> 01:10:12.68 I can live this way.
01:10:12.68 --> 01:10:13.84 I can do this.
01:10:13.84 --> 01:10:15.36 I can survive.
01:10:15.36 --> 01:10:16.64 I will survive.
01:10:16.64 --> 01:10:23.24 I sat there, thoughts drifting across the landscape of my life, shaped by these extraordinary
01:10:23.24 --> 01:10:25.64 circumstances.
01:10:25.64 --> 01:10:30.64 Eventually, I fell asleep, sitting upright that night, dreaming of what might become
01:10:30.64 --> 01:10:32.12 of me.
01:10:32.12 --> 01:10:37.64 I jolted awake, something scampered across my legs, something was on my feet, something
01:10:37.64 --> 01:10:42.76 small, cool, and wet, touched my arches and soles.
01:10:42.76 --> 01:10:50.20 The rat knows his poke and sniffed at my feet, tiny teeth noded my pulverized raw flesh.
01:10:50.20 --> 01:10:56.20 My arms swung without command as I batted, a large rat off my lap.
01:10:56.20 --> 01:11:01.80 Others scurried away, I screamed inside, lips pressed tightly shut, a muffled shriek of
01:11:01.80 --> 01:11:03.04 terror.
01:11:03.04 --> 01:11:06.68 I thrashed, my legs flailed, but went nowhere.
01:11:06.68 --> 01:11:11.16 I wiggled my feet as well as I could in the socks and got the rats off.
01:11:11.16 --> 01:11:15.24 They fled into the night only to return when I fell back asleep.
01:11:15.24 --> 01:11:23.24 They would return to torment me nearly every night in that jungle prison.
01:11:23.24 --> 01:11:27.16 I don't like rats this day.
01:11:27.16 --> 01:11:29.96 Some of my kids just mess with me and just bring up rats.
01:11:29.96 --> 01:11:35.96 I hate rats from that experience and that's not the beginning or the end of the rat
01:11:35.96 --> 01:11:39.68 experiences and prison.
01:11:39.68 --> 01:11:44.52 One thing that you did mention though that I liked it to highlight is hope.
01:11:44.52 --> 01:11:47.92 There was a phrase in there that I wasn't going to give up hope.
01:11:47.92 --> 01:11:50.68 Hope is such a powerful thing.
01:11:50.68 --> 01:11:52.52 It's there for all of us.
01:11:52.52 --> 01:11:57.44 We just need to grab a hold of it and hold it tightly.
01:11:57.44 --> 01:12:02.56 Hope was all I had for much of my time and captivity.
01:12:02.56 --> 01:12:09.92 Hope of surviving and in that survival of getting back to my two young kids, those two
01:12:09.92 --> 01:12:14.44 kids really played such a role in having me survive.
01:12:14.44 --> 01:12:18.56 My son when I went over there was four and a half years old, a little over four.
01:12:18.56 --> 01:12:23.76 My daughter was newborn, but when things get really really tough, I think of those kids
01:12:23.76 --> 01:12:29.92 and how about it was, I had to endure it to do my best to survive and get home to those
01:12:29.92 --> 01:12:30.92 kids.
01:12:30.92 --> 01:12:38.04 Yeah, I definitely, that's one of the things that I specifically highlighted.
01:12:38.04 --> 01:12:39.76 You know, I can live this way.
01:12:39.76 --> 01:12:41.04 I can do this.
01:12:41.04 --> 01:12:42.68 I can survive.
01:12:42.68 --> 01:12:45.24 I will survive.
01:12:45.24 --> 01:12:56.20 I still, I had hope and I read it just the way you just explained it hit me that hard.
01:12:56.20 --> 01:12:57.20 Back to the book.
01:12:57.20 --> 01:13:02.60 We sat for a few more hours.
01:13:02.60 --> 01:13:07.28 A pair of rag tag crew, almost everyone had been wounded, some gravely.
01:13:07.28 --> 01:13:09.36 Fulf covered their tattered uniforms.
01:13:09.36 --> 01:13:14.000 The whole place, stunk of sweat, blood, infection, feces and urine.
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.84 We were all hurting and some would die.
01:13:16.84 --> 01:13:22.40 Some consciously whispered to their neighbor, most like me, just sat and stared.
01:13:22.40 --> 01:13:23.40 That's what I did.
01:13:23.40 --> 01:13:27.16 I sat and stared at them, sitting and staring at nothing.
01:13:27.16 --> 01:13:30.84 I wondered if I would go crazy here, would I die here?
01:13:30.84 --> 01:13:32.24 What would happen first?
01:13:32.24 --> 01:13:34.68 Insanity or death?
01:13:34.68 --> 01:13:40.68 I snapped back to what little grass I had on reality, hold it together.
01:13:40.68 --> 01:13:41.68 Focus.
01:13:41.68 --> 01:13:43.12 Spence and Vicki.
01:13:43.12 --> 01:13:44.12 We'll hike.
01:13:44.12 --> 01:13:45.12 We'll play.
01:13:45.12 --> 01:13:46.76 Get back home for those kids.
01:13:46.76 --> 01:13:47.76 You can do it.
01:13:47.76 --> 01:13:50.12 You can endure.
01:13:50.12 --> 01:13:53.32 I couldn't allow my thoughts to drift in dark directions.
01:13:53.32 --> 01:13:59.08 I forced myself into logical, structured thinking.
01:13:59.08 --> 01:14:04.20 I began planning a hiking trip with my family, a backtrip, backing trip into the woods.
01:14:04.20 --> 01:14:05.56 I planned the route.
01:14:05.56 --> 01:14:07.52 The equipment loads for each.
01:14:07.52 --> 01:14:11.28 They'd be feather light for Vicki, a little more for Spence and Amy.
01:14:11.28 --> 01:14:12.52 I'd carry most of it.
01:14:12.52 --> 01:14:17.36 We'd eat dehydrated food, cooked around a small campfire.
01:14:17.36 --> 01:14:20.88 Delicious.
01:14:20.88 --> 01:14:24.12 I'll tell you, dehydrated food then sounded awfully, awfully.
01:14:24.12 --> 01:14:28.40 That was a gourmet meal.
01:14:28.40 --> 01:14:30.08 I did that.
01:14:30.08 --> 01:14:31.92 I got back from my captivity.
01:14:31.92 --> 01:14:33.92 I spent some men maybe going to this later.
01:14:33.92 --> 01:14:36.92 I won't get all the details of hospitalization and medical on all that.
01:14:36.92 --> 01:14:43.000 But when I got released from the hospital, finally took my family on vacation and he guesses
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.72 on what the first thing I did on that vacation.
01:14:45.72 --> 01:14:47.32 Tell me.
01:14:47.32 --> 01:14:51.48 I drove to the Olympic Peninsula and took my family backpacking.
01:14:51.48 --> 01:14:52.48 You're a hard man.
01:14:52.48 --> 01:14:54.000 You're the Olympic Peninsula.
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000 I love.
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000 I'm glad that I did.
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.40 I always enjoyed the wilderness in the woods.
01:14:59.40 --> 01:15:03.08 I would have been a much worse shape and captivity if I hadn't.
01:15:03.08 --> 01:15:06.80 But since then, I've loved the wilderness and the woods even more.
01:15:06.80 --> 01:15:10.52 I love every day, every beautiful day on God's screen, Earth.
01:15:10.52 --> 01:15:11.68 I love the wilderness and the woods.
01:15:11.68 --> 01:15:13.24 We were signed a Panama for a time on it.
01:15:13.24 --> 01:15:15.64 I've been dancing for Jumelsville.
01:15:15.64 --> 01:15:21.64 One thing my older son, the little four and a half year old boy, was an adult by then.
01:15:21.64 --> 01:15:22.64 We backpacked.
01:15:22.64 --> 01:15:25.12 We did a three-day journey across the Espezapana.
01:15:25.12 --> 01:15:26.28 Somewhere where nobody ever did.
01:15:26.28 --> 01:15:30.08 We just picked some place from the Atlantic side or the Pacific side.
01:15:30.08 --> 01:15:31.48 We did mountain bikes first.
01:15:31.48 --> 01:15:33.68 Then we backpacked, staying in the jungle.
01:15:33.68 --> 01:15:35.72 Until we got to the Rio Indio.
01:15:35.72 --> 01:15:36.72 It was dry season.
01:15:36.72 --> 01:15:40.08 We didn't plan it very well because we had to hike way down the Rio Indio before there
01:15:40.08 --> 01:15:44.40 was enough water to hire a guy at a Cayuga canoe to take us out to the ocean.
01:15:44.40 --> 01:15:47.16 That was just before my retirement.
01:15:47.16 --> 01:15:50.12 I've always loved the wilderness, loved the jungle.
01:15:50.12 --> 01:15:51.72 I don't know how we got on that thing.
01:15:51.72 --> 01:15:52.72 Back to the book.
01:15:52.72 --> 01:15:53.72 That's awesome.
01:15:53.72 --> 01:16:01.32 One of the things that I, again, I specifically highlighted was the fact that you would be
01:16:01.32 --> 01:16:05.60 drifting in these dark directions and you would force yourself.
01:16:05.60 --> 01:16:07.20 I talk about that too.
01:16:07.20 --> 01:16:08.32 I say mind control.
01:16:08.32 --> 01:16:10.64 Not mind control like, hey, we're going to control your mind.
01:16:10.64 --> 01:16:12.04 Control your own mind.
01:16:12.04 --> 01:16:13.40 Put your own thoughts in there.
01:16:13.40 --> 01:16:14.76 You can do that.
01:16:14.76 --> 01:16:17.84 People just need to learn how to do it and said, well, you start drifting off in the wrong
01:16:17.84 --> 01:16:18.84 direction.
01:16:18.84 --> 01:16:20.08 Control your thoughts.
01:16:20.08 --> 01:16:21.08 Get mind control.
01:16:21.08 --> 01:16:23.64 I love the fact that you did that.
01:16:23.64 --> 01:16:29.24 We such with such authority and power over what your brain was thinking.
01:16:29.24 --> 01:16:31.76 Yeah, I think that's an important message.
01:16:31.76 --> 01:16:33.64 I was a much overused phrase.
01:16:33.64 --> 01:16:38.28 You have glass half empty or glass half full kind of guy.
01:16:38.28 --> 01:16:45.40 I really would advocate for you have to be a glass half full kind of guy to survive.
01:16:45.40 --> 01:16:47.12 And I think I might carry the argument further.
01:16:47.12 --> 01:16:50.88 If you want to have a happy full enjoyable life, you'd damn well better be a half glass
01:16:50.88 --> 01:16:52.84 full kind of person.
01:16:52.84 --> 01:16:55.96 If you're, I mean, there's enough problems and difficulties in life.
01:16:55.96 --> 01:16:58.52 If you want to go for the dark side, it's there.
01:16:58.52 --> 01:17:00.32 You can go to it.
01:17:00.32 --> 01:17:03.60 But there's enough positive, wonderful things.
01:17:03.60 --> 01:17:06.80 The, yeah, grab that beat of hope and go for it.
01:17:06.80 --> 01:17:07.80 Absolutely.
01:17:07.80 --> 01:17:13.60 Back into the camp, back into the book, the camp provided a miserable existence on the edge
01:17:13.60 --> 01:17:15.24 of madness.
01:17:15.24 --> 01:17:19.24 All was filth and disease and suffering.
01:17:19.24 --> 01:17:23.72 Moans and whales of pain and anguish cried from the enclosures as we walked by.
01:17:23.72 --> 01:17:27.60 I caught glimpses of sick and wounded men inside cage after cage.
01:17:27.60 --> 01:17:33.64 Their eyes, white orbs of desperation, peering from grimy faces through the den of the
01:17:33.64 --> 01:17:35.000 gray world inside.
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:44.08 And now you're back in the stocks sitting there wounded in stocks in a bamboo cage and an
01:17:44.08 --> 01:17:47.24 unknown jungle prison camp with death all around me.
01:17:47.24 --> 01:17:51.64 I began to wonder how long can I endure this?
01:17:51.64 --> 01:17:56.88 Then my voice said out loud as long as it takes.
01:17:56.88 --> 01:18:00.52 Incredible.
01:18:00.52 --> 01:18:08.72 And here you meet in this prison camp, you meet Wayne Wayne.
01:18:08.72 --> 01:18:09.72 Wayne Finch.
01:18:09.72 --> 01:18:13.56 Yeah, the other American who was ill-prosemite, he had been captured.
01:18:13.56 --> 01:18:17.04 March April, a couple months before me.
01:18:17.04 --> 01:18:23.76 And you, Wayne, the crew, now you're going to get put on a long march.
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:25.76 They say we're going to move you out of this prison camp.
01:18:25.76 --> 01:18:27.28 Do you know you're going to hendoy at this moment?
01:18:27.28 --> 01:18:28.28 No, no.
01:18:28.28 --> 01:18:32.68 They pulled me out of my cage and I found myself in the center of the camp with a group
01:18:32.68 --> 01:18:36.12 of 25 South Vietnamese prisoners.
01:18:36.12 --> 01:18:40.76 I think they were all officers myself and Wayne.
01:18:40.76 --> 01:18:43.48 And they told us they were going to move us to a new camp.
01:18:43.48 --> 01:18:46.80 And the communist camp came in, it was running at the mouth and one of the South Vietnamese
01:18:46.80 --> 01:18:48.52 officers was translating for us.
01:18:48.52 --> 01:18:52.60 But they're going to move us to a new camp where conditions would be better.
01:18:52.60 --> 01:18:56.80 I mean, in this camp, people were dying almost every day.
01:18:56.80 --> 01:18:57.80 The conditions would be better.
01:18:57.80 --> 01:19:00.96 We'd get medical care, we'd get letters from home.
01:19:00.96 --> 01:19:02.88 But then we had very difficult journey.
01:19:02.88 --> 01:19:05.92 It could last for as long as 11 days.
01:19:05.92 --> 01:19:08.04 And we should try very hard to make it.
01:19:08.04 --> 01:19:09.52 That's what we were told.
01:19:09.52 --> 01:19:12.88 Now the private day is, I guess, was registering my mind.
01:19:12.88 --> 01:19:17.92 The private day hard to make it really didn't fully register until we actually set out marching.
01:19:17.92 --> 01:19:20.32 By this time, my ankle wound was very infected.
01:19:20.32 --> 01:19:21.56 My leg was very swollen.
01:19:21.56 --> 01:19:24.84 It was so painful just to take a step.
01:19:24.84 --> 01:19:27.96 And I was having to take step after step after step.
01:19:27.96 --> 01:19:31.02 And as I got into that march, I was wondering how I was going to get through the first
01:19:31.02 --> 01:19:32.02 day.
01:19:32.02 --> 01:19:33.02 I didn't think I could do it.
01:19:33.02 --> 01:19:37.72 I didn't know how I could possibly walk for a day through the jungle.
01:19:37.72 --> 01:19:39.92 They had us tied loosely together.
01:19:39.92 --> 01:19:42.16 Had our arms tied loose behind our backs.
01:19:42.16 --> 01:19:43.16 No shoes this time.
01:19:43.16 --> 01:19:44.40 This was barefoot.
01:19:44.40 --> 01:19:46.12 And off we went.
01:19:46.12 --> 01:19:48.36 Somehow I made it through that first day.
01:19:48.36 --> 01:19:50.40 And the day after that.
01:19:50.40 --> 01:19:52.16 And the day after that.
01:19:52.16 --> 01:19:57.84 The trip turned out to be not 11 days to a new camp somewhere in Cambodia or even louser
01:19:57.84 --> 01:19:59.64 back into Vietnam.
01:19:59.64 --> 01:20:02.84 That trip took over three months.
01:20:02.84 --> 01:20:05.88 And I did end up in Hanoi at the end of that trip.
01:20:05.88 --> 01:20:13.08 That journey cost the lives of six of the South Vietnamese prisoners in Wayne, the other
01:20:13.08 --> 01:20:16.80 American died before we got to Hanoi.
01:20:16.80 --> 01:20:19.28 And I damn near died a number of times.
01:20:19.28 --> 01:20:21.96 That's all in the book.
01:20:21.96 --> 01:20:28.60 The great Scott, I survived and made it and got all the way to Hanoi.
01:20:28.60 --> 01:20:34.08 He also got to know some of the Vietnamese soldiers.
01:20:34.08 --> 01:20:39.36 Some of them, one of them, lieutenant, Wayne, Dean, Zan.
01:20:39.36 --> 01:20:40.36 Is that right?
01:20:40.36 --> 01:20:41.36 That's very good.
01:20:41.36 --> 01:20:43.36 Zan, Zan, Zan.
01:20:43.36 --> 01:20:44.36 Zan.
01:20:44.36 --> 01:20:49.60 And he was, you know, obviously, you formed a really good relationship with him.
01:20:49.60 --> 01:20:50.84 Yes.
01:20:50.84 --> 01:20:51.84 Here we go back to the book.
01:20:51.84 --> 01:20:53.84 We tried to, let me interject one.
01:20:53.84 --> 01:20:57.12 Let me interject one thing because this is fascinating to me.
01:20:57.12 --> 01:20:58.12 It's always been.
01:20:58.12 --> 01:21:00.84 Well, I'll come back to it.
01:21:00.84 --> 01:21:02.32 Let me see where you're going to go with the conversation.
01:21:02.32 --> 01:21:04.92 You're going to get to my relationship with him and yeah.
01:21:04.92 --> 01:21:05.92 Okay.
01:21:05.92 --> 01:21:08.44 Yeah, absolutely.
01:21:08.44 --> 01:21:12.16 We tried it out of the valley up onto a rising ridge line.
01:21:12.16 --> 01:21:16.44 There wasn't much talking when we began to climb up the steep long trail.
01:21:16.44 --> 01:21:17.60 I was already exhausted.
01:21:17.60 --> 01:21:22.72 I had to push hard to make every step. my swollen infected ankle, fraught with pain.
01:21:22.72 --> 01:21:25.20 I wondered, is anyone else having this much trouble?
01:21:25.20 --> 01:21:27.68 How long am I be able to keep going?
01:21:27.68 --> 01:21:34.000 Only then did the words of the lead guard really hit me as long as 11 days try very hard
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000 to make it.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.88 My being revolted.
01:21:38.88 --> 01:21:40.28 My being revolted.
01:21:40.28 --> 01:21:43.48 11 days of this, how the hell am I going to be able to do that?
01:21:43.48 --> 01:21:46.36 In two seconds, I answered.
01:21:46.36 --> 01:21:53.60 I walked to as long as it takes, reached down deep, got to go, keep going.
01:21:53.60 --> 01:21:55.60 God helped me.
01:21:55.60 --> 01:21:56.60 Wayne was stoic.
01:21:56.60 --> 01:22:00.48 He was in better shape than I was, but still it had to be tough for him.
01:22:00.48 --> 01:22:04.52 He just board down and put out what was needed to keep on going.
01:22:04.52 --> 01:22:07.16 Some of the other prisoners did as well.
01:22:07.16 --> 01:22:08.44 Many like me had trouble.
01:22:08.44 --> 01:22:11.56 A number complained and a few cried.
01:22:11.56 --> 01:22:13.12 Other prisoners berated them.
01:22:13.12 --> 01:22:17.60 A couple of them fell down and whimpered and the guards yelled at them slapping kicking and
01:22:17.60 --> 01:22:21.32 hitting them with rifle butts until they got up.
01:22:21.32 --> 01:22:27.24 I thought this is going to be a long 11 days.
01:22:27.24 --> 01:22:31.92 And this is just continuing way past 11 days.
01:22:31.92 --> 01:22:34.28 You're now just beyond that.
01:22:34.28 --> 01:22:39.36 Continuing with the story as the days continued, I became weaker and lost weight.
01:22:39.36 --> 01:22:46.20 Others followed waves of shivering chills might be malaria, I suffered from diarrhea,
01:22:46.20 --> 01:22:47.92 probably dysentery.
01:22:47.92 --> 01:22:53.32 My festering ankle wound hurt more, the swelling grew worse aggravated by the journey.
01:22:53.32 --> 01:22:57.68 Leachas plagued me, sucking my blood and adding infections of their own.
01:22:57.68 --> 01:23:02.20 My right leg became a heavy painful mass that I dragged along the trail.
01:23:02.20 --> 01:23:04.24 I must have been a sight.
01:23:04.24 --> 01:23:09.32 Though my wounds placed me in a worse situation, Wayne was sick and deteriorating too.
01:23:09.32 --> 01:23:13.08 He had some sort of jungle fever and lost his appetite.
01:23:13.08 --> 01:23:17.64 He quit eating regular rice, preferred only the crispy layer that formed right next to
01:23:17.64 --> 01:23:23.04 the surface of the cooking pot, what the Vietnamese called calm chae or fire rice.
01:23:23.04 --> 01:23:25.08 Zon was having troubles too.
01:23:25.08 --> 01:23:30.68 Injuries from his shoot down declined from months in captivity, poor diet disease,
01:23:30.68 --> 01:23:34.76 then the daily toll of this horrendous martial north.
01:23:34.76 --> 01:23:40.28 He stepped away, our personal demons threatened our physical ability and meant to willingness
01:23:40.28 --> 01:23:42.56 to press on.
01:23:42.56 --> 01:23:44.20 Everyone suffered.
01:23:44.20 --> 01:23:50.88 We looked like the walking dead, struggling to survive each agonizing mile of that march.
01:23:50.88 --> 01:23:55.28 Most of us stoically face the challenges that beset us.
01:23:55.28 --> 01:24:00.92 Sometimes selfishness and self-pity erupted and tempers flaired, pain and suffering took
01:24:00.92 --> 01:24:03.20 its toll.
01:24:03.20 --> 01:24:07.04 The senior ranking prisoner in our group was fam van Than.
01:24:07.04 --> 01:24:09.44 A major in the South Vietnamese Army.
01:24:09.44 --> 01:24:14.32 He tried his best to be a leader for the 25 South Vietnamese officers and two American
01:24:14.32 --> 01:24:17.68 helicopter pilots under the most trying conditions.
01:24:17.68 --> 01:24:20.32 The enemy gave him no authority to lead.
01:24:20.32 --> 01:24:23.28 I had a lot of respect for what Than tried to do.
01:24:23.28 --> 01:24:26.40 I felt the frustration he had to endure.
01:24:26.40 --> 01:24:30.36 Moral sunk lower and lower, bickering grew rampant.
01:24:30.36 --> 01:24:35.76 The prisoners died, Than was senior, but most dismissed his efforts as they struggled
01:24:35.76 --> 01:24:38.52 to survive.
01:24:38.52 --> 01:24:42.24 And now there's a prisoner that goes down on the trail.
01:24:42.24 --> 01:24:44.36 The guards yelled back and forth to each other.
01:24:44.36 --> 01:24:46.92 They ranted at the prisoner lying on the ground.
01:24:46.92 --> 01:24:48.72 They barked orders to the rest of us.
01:24:48.72 --> 01:24:50.56 I didn't understand any of it.
01:24:50.56 --> 01:24:53.64 Zan said softly, but earnestly to wane in me.
01:24:53.64 --> 01:24:55.88 Keep walking, no stop.
01:24:55.88 --> 01:24:57.28 We continued.
01:24:57.28 --> 01:25:00.48 One guard stayed with the prostate prisoner where he lay.
01:25:00.48 --> 01:25:02.88 We walked on.
01:25:02.88 --> 01:25:07.16 After a short while, bang.
01:25:07.16 --> 01:25:09.72 One shot.
01:25:09.72 --> 01:25:12.68 Sometime later the guard caught up.
01:25:12.68 --> 01:25:16.52 A dull sense of disbelief and shock overcame me.
01:25:16.52 --> 01:25:20.16 I had no doubt what had just happened.
01:25:20.16 --> 01:25:21.84 I kept walking.
01:25:21.84 --> 01:25:26.16 As I cried, it was clear.
01:25:26.16 --> 01:25:34.08 If you could not march, you would die.
01:25:34.08 --> 01:25:36.92 That message really settled into my mind at that point.
01:25:36.92 --> 01:25:40.88 I knew if I ever got to the point where I couldn't march anymore, that would probably
01:25:40.88 --> 01:25:44.28 happen to me as well.
01:25:44.28 --> 01:25:50.08 The aside that I wanted to say about Son was, and it was mentioned Son was a Vietnamese
01:25:50.08 --> 01:25:57.08 Air Force pilot. He was young and strong and in my mind, he was a lot bigger than he
01:25:57.08 --> 01:26:01.36 was, because he still has short-statured Vietnamese.
01:26:01.36 --> 01:26:08.64 He was the A1 pilot that I saw shot down on my way to Ben Hett, that I asked for permission
01:26:08.64 --> 01:26:10.84 to go help rescue.
01:26:10.84 --> 01:26:14.92 We put that together shortly after we started that March north of what he was flying
01:26:14.92 --> 01:26:16.52 where he was when he was shot down.
01:26:16.52 --> 01:26:21.04 That's my God. We were shot down the same day.
01:26:21.04 --> 01:26:27.88 That's one of the reasons I included that piece, because it was such a coincidence or
01:26:27.88 --> 01:26:29.92 fate that you guys were.
01:26:29.92 --> 01:26:30.92 That was him.
01:26:30.92 --> 01:26:31.92 There you were.
01:26:31.92 --> 01:26:33.56 He turned out to be such a good friend.
01:26:33.56 --> 01:26:44.48 I owe my life to several people, Wayne Finch, and Son, especially for what he did for me.
01:26:44.48 --> 01:26:49.40 Back to the book, the journey was a nightmare, a horrid soul-wrenching nightmare.
01:26:49.40 --> 01:26:50.40 It grew worse.
01:26:50.40 --> 01:26:51.80 Others fell out and died.
01:26:51.80 --> 01:26:54.72 Each step every day racked my body with pain.
01:26:54.72 --> 01:26:59.60 My infections became worse, disease was taking me.
01:26:59.60 --> 01:27:04.000 I knew I was sliding closer to death, but I kept fighting as hard as I could.
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.60 To keep my spirits up, I continually thought, continuously thought of my family.
01:27:08.60 --> 01:27:11.92 Of things I would do with Spencer and Vicki when I got home.
01:27:11.92 --> 01:27:17.84 Making of those two kids gave me strength, always bolstered my hope.
01:27:17.84 --> 01:27:21.20 My leg was now swollen to twice its normal size.
01:27:21.20 --> 01:27:23.72 Dark colored filled with pus.
01:27:23.72 --> 01:27:26.20 Long splits formed in the skin.
01:27:26.20 --> 01:27:30.16 Puss and bloody stinking fluid oozed from the cracks.
01:27:30.16 --> 01:27:33.32 I dragged it along like a sodden club.
01:27:33.32 --> 01:27:38.32 Every movement last me with searing pain that kept my face contorted.
01:27:38.32 --> 01:27:41.36 I shrieked a silent cry within.
01:27:41.36 --> 01:27:46.44 And burdened a black and scar deep in the center of my soul.
01:27:46.44 --> 01:27:51.44 Gang green said in, my bloody dysentery worsened.
01:27:51.44 --> 01:27:53.52 I had chills and fevers.
01:27:53.52 --> 01:27:58.64 I would find out later that I had three different kinds of malaria.
01:27:58.64 --> 01:28:03.80 Each morning I fought a battle to stand.
01:28:03.80 --> 01:28:10.92 And with all that going on, I tried to maintain a sense of humor.
01:28:10.92 --> 01:28:13.28 It was hard, but it was necessary.
01:28:13.28 --> 01:28:18.96 Spirit is the most important factor in survival, a sense of human, humor, even under the
01:28:18.96 --> 01:28:24.72 worst conditions helps maintain spirit and in spirit lives hope.
01:28:24.72 --> 01:28:27.08 I was determined to survive.
01:28:27.08 --> 01:28:30.36 Still I owed so much to Wayne and Zahn.
01:28:30.36 --> 01:28:34.28 They helped me during the through the worst and were always concerned about me.
01:28:34.28 --> 01:28:36.000 They did all they could to help me.
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.92 Zahn especially helped me remain positive to be hopeful.
01:28:39.92 --> 01:28:44.96 As bad as things ever got, I never gave up hope.
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:51.44 I mustered all my will each day just to wake, stand and take a step.
01:28:51.44 --> 01:28:56.24 Then I fought hard for the remainder of the day to keep going, moving along the trail.
01:28:56.24 --> 01:28:59.12 I could barely walk, but somehow I did.
01:28:59.12 --> 01:29:04.72 I survived each day to open my eyes in the morning to the gift of one more dawn.
01:29:04.72 --> 01:29:11.40 Realities of my miserable world or clear, death are constant companion stalked us waiting
01:29:11.40 --> 01:29:16.88 for us to give into its relentless temptation.
01:29:16.88 --> 01:29:19.24 That would be the easy thing to do.
01:29:19.24 --> 01:29:24.28 In normal life, you have to take some over action to die.
01:29:24.28 --> 01:29:26.96 You have to kill yourself.
01:29:26.96 --> 01:29:32.72 As a prisoner of war under these circumstances, that is reversed.
01:29:32.72 --> 01:29:39.64 You have to reach deep within yourself and struggle each day to stay alive.
01:29:39.64 --> 01:29:42.12 Dying is easy.
01:29:42.12 --> 01:29:43.96 Just relax.
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:45.44 Do nothing.
01:29:45.44 --> 01:29:46.44 Give up.
01:29:46.44 --> 01:29:49.44 Then peacefully surrender.
01:29:49.44 --> 01:29:54.88 Stop gagging down food, stop struggling to walk, stop fighting.
01:29:54.88 --> 01:29:58.28 And you will die.
01:29:58.28 --> 01:30:04.16 They did.
01:30:04.16 --> 01:30:09.80 That is an incredible paradox that you point out there.
01:30:09.80 --> 01:30:13.56 It is something that I saw because it is.
01:30:13.56 --> 01:30:17.20 If you give up, you just die.
01:30:17.20 --> 01:30:19.92 Stop eating and you die.
01:30:19.92 --> 01:30:21.92 It is hard to stay alive.
01:30:21.92 --> 01:30:24.16 You need something to motivate you to stay alive.
01:30:24.16 --> 01:30:28.04 I can't talk enough about those two kids.
01:30:28.04 --> 01:30:34.16 When they listen to this, it is hard to keep them from getting emotional.
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:43.08 Those two little kids are probably the single most important reason that I survived along
01:30:43.08 --> 01:30:46.60 with a lot of other things that helped.
01:30:46.60 --> 01:30:53.28 That little four years, four and a half year old boy will celebrate his 50th birthday in
01:30:53.28 --> 01:30:54.28 April.
01:30:54.28 --> 01:30:58.40 And you will be there with him.
01:30:58.40 --> 01:31:02.40 Beautiful.
01:31:02.40 --> 01:31:04.04 I think we are getting to the low point here.
01:31:04.04 --> 01:31:07.72 The worst day of my life came a few weeks into this trip.
01:31:07.72 --> 01:31:10.44 I fought hard to continue the march, but I faltered.
01:31:10.44 --> 01:31:13.88 I dug deep inside myself for strength.
01:31:13.88 --> 01:31:15.72 There was nothing there.
01:31:15.72 --> 01:31:16.72 I dug deeper.
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:19.92 I staggered on and faltered again.
01:31:19.92 --> 01:31:21.04 I struggled more.
01:31:21.04 --> 01:31:22.32 I reached deeper yet.
01:31:22.32 --> 01:31:25.92 I prayed for more strength.
01:31:25.92 --> 01:31:28.20 There was none.
01:31:28.20 --> 01:31:29.68 I collapsed.
01:31:29.68 --> 01:31:31.72 I got up and stumbled along.
01:31:31.72 --> 01:31:33.64 I collapsed again and again.
01:31:33.64 --> 01:31:35.16 And I got up again and again.
01:31:35.16 --> 01:31:41.60 I fought with all I had in my body, heart and soul.
01:31:41.60 --> 01:31:44.24 I collapsed and couldn't get up.
01:31:44.24 --> 01:31:46.40 I could not will myself up.
01:31:46.40 --> 01:31:50.16 I was at the end of my life.
01:31:50.16 --> 01:31:51.52 The guard looked down on me.
01:31:51.52 --> 01:31:52.96 He ordered me up.
01:31:52.96 --> 01:31:53.96 He yelled at me.
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:56.48 I could not.
01:31:56.48 --> 01:31:58.08 It was done.
01:31:58.08 --> 01:32:00.52 I knew my life was ended.
01:32:00.52 --> 01:32:08.000 Here on this miserable muddy jungle trail, it was over.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000 Would my family ever know what had happened to me?
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.84 Then Zon was there looking worried bending over me, the guard yelled at him to stop.
01:32:18.84 --> 01:32:21.40 Undeterred Zon reached down to help me.
01:32:21.40 --> 01:32:26.16 The guard yelled louder but Zon's face was set with determination.
01:32:26.16 --> 01:32:31.08 In spite of whatever threats the guard was screaming, Zon raised me up, turned and pulled
01:32:31.08 --> 01:32:34.04 me onto his frail weak back.
01:32:34.04 --> 01:32:39.48 He wrapped my arms around his neck and clasped my wrists together in front of him.
01:32:39.48 --> 01:32:45.28 The rest of the day he pulled me along, my feet dragging on the ground behind.
01:32:45.28 --> 01:32:48.88 Part of the time he was helped by Lieutenant Hong.
01:32:48.88 --> 01:32:56.000 Longly a big, impish brute helped briefly but it was Zon who carried the burden that day.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.84 It was Zon who risked his own life to lift me from death.
01:33:00.84 --> 01:33:08.24 It was Zon who carried me and cared for me until we completed that long day struggle
01:33:08.24 --> 01:33:11.44 at another wayside camp.
01:33:11.44 --> 01:33:22.12 I definitely owe him my life absolutely.
01:33:22.12 --> 01:33:25.24 You end up falling into a river as well.
01:33:25.24 --> 01:33:29.12 Yeah, that's the next day when we tried to set out and I couldn't get back up.
01:33:29.12 --> 01:33:35.44 I mean my ankle bone was so infected I could barely move that leg and three kinds of malaria
01:33:35.44 --> 01:33:42.44 and dysentery and three kinds of intestinal parasites, smell absorption syndrome I was just
01:33:42.44 --> 01:33:45.32 a bad bad way.
01:33:45.32 --> 01:33:49.92 You fall into this river, backed the books Zon and Wayne came off the log and down the
01:33:49.92 --> 01:33:52.04 high steep bank to my rescue.
01:33:52.04 --> 01:33:55.28 They waited into the turn and pulled me back onto the bank.
01:33:55.28 --> 01:33:58.68 With Wayne shouting and English and Zon and Vietnamese, they pleaded for the group to stay
01:33:58.68 --> 01:34:01.36 at the camp until I was able to travel again.
01:34:01.36 --> 01:34:03.24 They were ordered away.
01:34:03.24 --> 01:34:07.52 They wouldn't leave me, guards dragged them away and forced them across to the log bridge
01:34:07.52 --> 01:34:09.04 at gunpoint.
01:34:09.04 --> 01:34:12.24 They marched off with the rest of our prisoner group.
01:34:12.24 --> 01:34:17.16 Everyone believed I was left at that camp to die.
01:34:17.16 --> 01:34:19.16 So you get left by that group.
01:34:19.16 --> 01:34:20.16 I do.
01:34:20.16 --> 01:34:25.80 And you go to another camp where they kind of let you recover a little bit.
01:34:25.80 --> 01:34:29.48 Yeah, well I actually stayed in that camp and for some reason the decision was because I
01:34:29.48 --> 01:34:34.96 had any medical treatment to that point at all for months.
01:34:34.96 --> 01:34:37.60 And that camp would me lay it up there.
01:34:37.60 --> 01:34:43.88 They got the camp medic and came over and I got some shots of penicillin.
01:34:43.88 --> 01:34:48.64 I guess the only reason for this decision was we were along the trail and had north and
01:34:48.64 --> 01:34:49.84 they wanted to give me an oil.
01:34:49.84 --> 01:34:55.24 If it all possible, so they did give me penicillin shots for about five days running.
01:34:55.24 --> 01:35:00.92 And as soon as I could stand up again and put any weight on my leg at all, then off we went
01:35:00.92 --> 01:35:02.24 back on the trail.
01:35:02.24 --> 01:35:03.88 And now you're on the trail.
01:35:03.88 --> 01:35:05.60 You were one guard at this point.
01:35:05.60 --> 01:35:08.48 I was one man, one guard, and you don't go north.
01:35:08.48 --> 01:35:09.48 Yeah, too.
01:35:09.48 --> 01:35:10.48 Do these.
01:35:10.48 --> 01:35:11.48 Do you?
01:35:11.48 --> 01:35:17.84 And you're again, you're hiking again, challenging terrain.
01:35:17.84 --> 01:35:22.64 And going back to the book, we continued after day after miserable day.
01:35:22.64 --> 01:35:27.72 The journey was taking its toll, stretching my will to press on again.
01:35:27.72 --> 01:35:32.44 It's like you just keep getting to the bottom and finding more unbelievable.
01:35:32.44 --> 01:35:36.000 Each day is tracked and demanded more than I thought I had to give.
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.12 I was able to go on only by scraping up the few remaining bits of grit that remained in
01:35:41.12 --> 01:35:44.40 the most obscure recesses of my heart and soul.
01:35:44.40 --> 01:35:50.64 I prayed, I commanded, I willed myself to take step after impossible step.
01:35:50.64 --> 01:35:56.16 But effort itself fed an agony festering within me which swelled and nod at my core as
01:35:56.16 --> 01:35:59.24 a weak, followed, wretched weak.
01:35:59.24 --> 01:36:03.08 Malaria, tax and bouts of bloody disentery tortured me.
01:36:03.08 --> 01:36:08.12 The pain of my broken back pierced me every day, the souls of my feet were mosaics of
01:36:08.12 --> 01:36:13.20 raised well, it's an open bleeding gashes and punctures, previously broken toes,
01:36:13.20 --> 01:36:15.64 thrown up as I broke them again.
01:36:15.64 --> 01:36:20.24 And as always, there was the pesky leeches.
01:36:20.24 --> 01:36:22.88 But I was still alive.
01:36:22.88 --> 01:36:30.36 And for that, I thanked God.
01:36:30.36 --> 01:36:39.04 And not only did you thank God, you also still tried to escape in that state.
01:36:39.04 --> 01:36:44.08 That was one of the stupidest things I did in my entire cap to, but yes, I had that in the
01:36:44.08 --> 01:36:46.80 code of conduct, escape, escape, escape.
01:36:46.80 --> 01:36:50.88 And we had planned, even in that first jungle camp, had planned and escaped from there
01:36:50.88 --> 01:36:56.44 with Wayne, but it was because of my poor condition, Wayne said, let's, we're going to
01:36:56.44 --> 01:36:58.68 wait till you get some strength through this and I'm going to work.
01:36:58.68 --> 01:37:02.12 And then, of course, they took us off on the trip that Wayne didn't survive.
01:37:02.12 --> 01:37:05.32 But yes, so the day that I finally did, I mean, had an opportunity.
01:37:05.32 --> 01:37:07.32 You mentioned I was with one guard.
01:37:07.32 --> 01:37:11.80 We'd often travel with groups of other groups of North Vietnamese going up and down the trail.
01:37:11.80 --> 01:37:14.68 And we were traveling with one such group this day.
01:37:14.68 --> 01:37:16.48 And I don't know where you're going to pick up the stories.
01:37:16.48 --> 01:37:18.48 So you can just tell, tell, tell, part of it.
01:37:18.48 --> 01:37:24.20 So my guard zoo is talking to some other North Vietnamese guy and they, and I, we're
01:37:24.20 --> 01:37:25.20 all in a big group.
01:37:25.20 --> 01:37:28.000 And so they fall behind and I'm still with the many group.
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.24 But I'm kind of slowing down and the group is moving away from me.
01:37:31.24 --> 01:37:36.20 And it came around one turn in the trail, one corner, no zoo behind me, no group in front
01:37:36.20 --> 01:37:37.20 of me.
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:40.000 So just in that instant, I said, this is my chance.
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.24 And plus I knew about where we were, near the Demelitrizone, we were only several miles
01:37:45.24 --> 01:37:46.24 from the coast.
01:37:46.24 --> 01:37:47.60 So that's in the back of my mind.
01:37:47.60 --> 01:37:49.08 I think I could make it.
01:37:49.08 --> 01:37:53.56 So I just took off the trail and headed up the side of a hill with my great escape, which
01:37:53.56 --> 01:37:58.68 is only lasted for a very few, well, I don't even know, lasted two minutes.
01:37:58.68 --> 01:38:03.24 But a very few moments before I was recaptured, were you going to read some of that?
01:38:03.24 --> 01:38:04.44 Yeah, this is what happened.
01:38:04.44 --> 01:38:05.44 You knew get recaptured.
01:38:05.44 --> 01:38:06.44 Here's your thoughts.
01:38:06.44 --> 01:38:07.44 I'm dead.
01:38:07.44 --> 01:38:08.44 It's all over.
01:38:08.44 --> 01:38:09.64 Zoo hovered over me.
01:38:09.64 --> 01:38:13.52 His AK-47, Mujel shifting from the center of my face to the middle of my chest.
01:38:13.52 --> 01:38:14.52 He treats you.
01:38:14.52 --> 01:38:15.52 Why you?
01:38:15.52 --> 01:38:18.96 His face burned red as eyes wild and rage.
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:21.36 Spit sprayed as he screamed at me.
01:38:21.36 --> 01:38:22.36 This is it.
01:38:22.36 --> 01:38:23.76 His fingers on the trigger.
01:38:23.76 --> 01:38:26.000 He's going to kill me.
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000 And then you.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000 I missed the trail.
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.88 I got lost.
01:38:29.88 --> 01:38:30.88 He didn't shoot.
01:38:30.88 --> 01:38:33.000 He pointed his rifle away in a solemn voice.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000 He commanded, get up.
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000 You do very bad.
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.84 You have big problem now.
01:38:36.84 --> 01:38:38.80 He was shaking and raged.
01:38:38.80 --> 01:38:42.64 He motioned down the hill and said, go.
01:38:42.64 --> 01:38:48.24 I think more that was ever done to me never heard about the incident again.
01:38:48.24 --> 01:38:52.84 My psychological assessment is he was so embarrassed and would have been so much trouble
01:38:52.84 --> 01:38:53.84 to worry.
01:38:53.84 --> 01:38:55.08 Yeah, well, how'd you lose your personal eyes?
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:56.08 Talk to yourself guy.
01:38:56.08 --> 01:38:57.08 I wasn't.
01:38:57.08 --> 01:38:58.32 He's just like, you know what?
01:38:58.32 --> 01:39:00.68 We're just going to come for that one.
01:39:00.68 --> 01:39:04.16 Yeah, he was out of all the guards that I encountered.
01:39:04.16 --> 01:39:09.04 He was about the worst, the meanest despise me, the most I think of almost anyone that
01:39:09.04 --> 01:39:10.04 I encountered.
01:39:10.04 --> 01:39:12.60 And lucky me, I get stuck with him being my one single
01:39:12.60 --> 01:39:15.80 guard that was moving me after I get stuck with him.
01:39:15.80 --> 01:39:17.84 Was he with you with that original group and that he stayed with him?
01:39:17.84 --> 01:39:22.32 Yeah, in fact, when I've got to that first jungle camp living in the cages, he was
01:39:22.32 --> 01:39:24.60 our interrogator there.
01:39:24.60 --> 01:39:26.36 I almost actually felt sorry for the guy.
01:39:26.36 --> 01:39:27.88 His English was so bad.
01:39:27.88 --> 01:39:30.44 It was as bad as my high school level Spanish was.
01:39:30.44 --> 01:39:33.64 I mean, he just could barely speak English and he's trying to interrogate us and
01:39:33.64 --> 01:39:35.88 propaganda hisists and all this.
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:38.84 But yeah, so he was the only guard that was spoken English at all.
01:39:38.84 --> 01:39:42.80 So when I had to be separated from the group, they assigned him to be the one to stay
01:39:42.80 --> 01:39:46.36 back with me and move me north.
01:39:46.36 --> 01:39:52.84 And now, again, fast forward, you're now in a truck.
01:39:52.84 --> 01:39:55.24 You're now moving in vehicles.
01:39:55.24 --> 01:39:56.88 Okay, we got in the north.
01:39:56.88 --> 01:40:01.000 Walked all the way up across the north or two the north three enemies border on foot.
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.48 So we're all the way just north of the demelitarized zone at this point.
01:40:05.48 --> 01:40:09.76 And then they put us on trucks to move us in the north Vietnam and inside North Vietnam,
01:40:09.76 --> 01:40:12.16 we'd some nights move and trucks.
01:40:12.16 --> 01:40:15.84 Some days and nights would, would march depending on the threat from American air strikes.
01:40:15.84 --> 01:40:19.60 And of course, the trucks of these old, you know, Soviet air things with no shocks.
01:40:19.60 --> 01:40:23.44 And by the way, you've a broken back at this point and it's not like the roads in North
01:40:23.44 --> 01:40:26.000 Vietnam or in any kind of condition.
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.56 So it's, no, we first got on the trucks.
01:40:27.56 --> 01:40:32.24 I mean, after all this death march north, my my attitude was, oh, trucks.
01:40:32.24 --> 01:40:33.24 This is wonderful.
01:40:33.24 --> 01:40:34.24 God.
01:40:34.24 --> 01:40:37.32 And God, on the bed of that truck, it took about a minute and a half,
01:40:37.32 --> 01:40:42.16 we're driving down the road and that truck with no shocks, no springs, slam, slam, slam,
01:40:42.16 --> 01:40:45.52 to, yeah, you literally had a broken back at this point.
01:40:45.52 --> 01:40:47.52 I literally had a broken back.
01:40:47.52 --> 01:40:53.44 And, and of course, as you said, I think you described this to your wife as a series
01:40:53.44 --> 01:40:55.12 of unfortunate events.
01:40:55.12 --> 01:41:01.000 So now you're out there and you see a flare in the sky.
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.40 You recognize immediately.
01:41:02.40 --> 01:41:03.40 You know what's coming.
01:41:03.40 --> 01:41:08.52 But first to or fly mohawk, up off the coast, we would pick up targets on radar at
01:41:08.52 --> 01:41:13.16 night of the convoys moving along Highway 1 inside North Vietnam and we turn it over to
01:41:13.16 --> 01:41:19.64 F4 fighter jets from the 490, second 97th fighter wing out of Thailand.
01:41:19.64 --> 01:41:22.80 And they were called the night fighters and they dropped flares and then strike the target.
01:41:22.80 --> 01:41:25.12 So yes, I knew exactly what was taking place.
01:41:25.12 --> 01:41:28.28 So you yell out air strike.
01:41:28.28 --> 01:41:29.52 And then here we go back to the book.
01:41:29.52 --> 01:41:35.80 F1st F4 screamed down from altitude and bombs exploded nearby, NVA and to NVA, anti-aircraft
01:41:35.80 --> 01:41:36.80 fire responded.
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:41.64 The next F4 screeched toward us, more bombs, more anti-aircraft.
01:41:41.64 --> 01:41:45.68 I began repeating, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
01:41:45.68 --> 01:41:50.16 Yay, though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for
01:41:50.16 --> 01:41:54.72 thou art with me, for thou art with me, good God.
01:41:54.72 --> 01:41:55.92 The earth shook.
01:41:55.92 --> 01:41:59.36 Our truck banged about as if in an earthquake.
01:41:59.36 --> 01:42:02.48 Older's yelled from other trucks as some were hit.
01:42:02.48 --> 01:42:06.24 The world shuddered in explosions and flames.
01:42:06.24 --> 01:42:11.52 Then it was done.
01:42:11.52 --> 01:42:18.20 That was our first, yeah, first or second night on trucks after we got into North Vietnam.
01:42:18.20 --> 01:42:21.92 Yes, so not only did I have the unpleasant bouncing around that was extremely painful.
01:42:21.92 --> 01:42:25.24 I also, I think I mentioned the book got a horrible case of heartburn at night, too.
01:42:25.24 --> 01:42:31.76 I got all this sour belts as going on and then we got that air strike.
01:42:31.76 --> 01:42:37.16 Again, that wasn't the first or last air strike that I experienced, but that was pretty horrific.
01:42:37.16 --> 01:42:38.52 They hit some of the vehicles that were there.
01:42:38.52 --> 01:42:39.52 They did.
01:42:39.52 --> 01:42:41.80 Some of the Vietnamese so-called.
01:42:41.80 --> 01:42:45.60 At this point, when I got right to the border, just before we got into the trucks,
01:42:45.60 --> 01:42:50.60 I was married up with a second group of South Vietnamese prisoners, senior officer, South Vietnamese
01:42:50.60 --> 01:42:51.60 prisoners.
01:42:51.60 --> 01:42:55.44 Our group of prisoners was on one truck, but yeah, other trucks in the convoy got hit
01:42:55.44 --> 01:43:00.84 and people killed and luckily we didn't.
01:43:00.84 --> 01:43:05.68 Now you get into another camp and I'm going back to the book.
01:43:05.68 --> 01:43:11.40 The guards took us to a small hut with posts and enough to tie our hammocks.
01:43:11.40 --> 01:43:14.80 They fastened the door shut and placed local militia guards outside.
01:43:14.80 --> 01:43:17.12 We settled in getting comfortable and resting.
01:43:17.12 --> 01:43:18.28 The door opened.
01:43:18.28 --> 01:43:20.56 A guard came in and said something.
01:43:20.56 --> 01:43:24.48 A South Vietnamese prisoner entered behind him, lieutenant hung.
01:43:24.48 --> 01:43:25.48 My God.
01:43:25.48 --> 01:43:27.04 I knew.
01:43:27.04 --> 01:43:29.84 It was Wayne who had died in this camp.
01:43:29.84 --> 01:43:31.32 Captain Wayne Finch.
01:43:31.32 --> 01:43:32.92 Wayne was dead.
01:43:32.92 --> 01:43:34.16 My God.
01:43:34.16 --> 01:43:38.32 hung stared as if at a ghost, astounded to see me alive.
01:43:38.32 --> 01:43:39.32 He cried.
01:43:39.32 --> 01:43:44.68 I sat slump, devastated at the realization that Wayne Finch was dead.
01:43:44.68 --> 01:43:47.80 My friend Wayne who had helped me cared for me.
01:43:47.80 --> 01:43:50.52 My friend Wayne who I owed so much.
01:43:50.52 --> 01:43:54.64 He was dead.
01:43:54.64 --> 01:43:55.64 Shocked.
01:43:55.64 --> 01:43:56.64 Disbelieving.
01:43:56.64 --> 01:43:58.76 I introduced hung to the others.
01:43:58.76 --> 01:44:01.68 He told us how everyone thought I was dead.
01:44:01.68 --> 01:44:05.40 How the group suffered on the march north after they left me.
01:44:05.40 --> 01:44:07.84 How to tall American pilots join them.
01:44:07.84 --> 01:44:12.60 How Wayne continued to get sicker, lost hope, and grew weak.
01:44:12.60 --> 01:44:19.88 I fell into sadness, twisting it into melancholy self-pity, sinking to the lowest point.
01:44:19.88 --> 01:44:25.88 I had known.
01:44:25.88 --> 01:44:27.80 And I had to be to be devastating.
01:44:27.80 --> 01:44:28.80 It was.
01:44:28.80 --> 01:44:33.88 We had been separated and what I got to this camp with the new group of South Vietnamese.
01:44:33.88 --> 01:44:37.56 When we arrived at the camp, the camp commander gave a speech.
01:44:37.56 --> 01:44:42.12 I could hear him say, Finch and the South Vietnamese officers transform.
01:44:42.12 --> 01:44:43.76 We said, do you know of Finch?
01:44:43.76 --> 01:44:45.84 There was an American Finch that died in this camp.
01:44:45.84 --> 01:44:52.60 I said, no one even knew what I should have put together with the bad pronunciation was
01:44:52.60 --> 01:44:53.60 Finch.
01:44:53.60 --> 01:44:58.24 And hung had been one of the guys who helped drag me through the jungle with the sun.
01:44:58.24 --> 01:45:02.56 And as soon as I saw hung, I knew that it was Finch.
01:45:02.56 --> 01:45:06.96 They took me to see the grave where he was buried.
01:45:06.96 --> 01:45:11.40 At least that rough idea of where we were helped me when I came back to my debriefs to
01:45:11.40 --> 01:45:13.16 get that location to the Americans.
01:45:13.16 --> 01:45:15.88 And eventually took a few years for several years.
01:45:15.88 --> 01:45:18.44 Wayne's body was recovered and brought back.
01:45:18.44 --> 01:45:22.64 That was a low morale point for me on the trip.
01:45:22.64 --> 01:45:23.64 That was devastating.
01:45:23.64 --> 01:45:25.84 You're going to go to the potato story?
01:45:25.84 --> 01:45:26.84 No, tell the potato story.
01:45:26.84 --> 01:45:27.84 Okay, I'll tell the potatoes.
01:45:27.84 --> 01:45:28.84 Because this is another guy.
01:45:28.84 --> 01:45:29.84 There are two Vietnamese.
01:45:29.84 --> 01:45:32.84 A lot of people helped me to follow you.
01:45:32.84 --> 01:45:33.84 I survived.
01:45:33.84 --> 01:45:36.64 Tell the potato story and then I'll wrap it up for you.
01:45:36.64 --> 01:45:37.84 Because it's, yeah, tell the potato story.
01:45:37.84 --> 01:45:38.84 Okay.
01:45:38.84 --> 01:45:39.84 How would you do that time?
01:45:39.84 --> 01:45:40.84 Where did this go in on and on?
01:45:40.84 --> 01:45:41.84 We're good.
01:45:41.84 --> 01:45:42.84 All right.
01:45:42.84 --> 01:45:45.96 So, son, it helped me as we already described.
01:45:45.96 --> 01:45:52.24 But in the second group of prisoners, I came to know one Lieutenant Colonel Kayn Yim, who
01:45:52.24 --> 01:45:53.88 today lives in San Jose, California.
01:45:53.88 --> 01:45:55.36 I'm still a dear friend.
01:45:55.36 --> 01:45:59.16 But Kay when he was captured, had a gold cross pen.
01:45:59.16 --> 01:46:00.16 I mean, real gold.
01:46:00.16 --> 01:46:01.76 It was a very valuable pen.
01:46:01.76 --> 01:46:04.64 When he was captured, he hid it in the lining of his uniform.
01:46:04.64 --> 01:46:08.48 He was going to trade it for something for his own benefit when he got to wherever
01:46:08.48 --> 01:46:10.72 he was going to get to.
01:46:10.72 --> 01:46:12.60 So I'm in the state that you've described.
01:46:12.60 --> 01:46:16.84 I'm just physically erect now emotionally mentally in a low.
01:46:16.84 --> 01:46:18.24 We're being held in a hut.
01:46:18.24 --> 01:46:20.72 There's a local militia guy guarding it outside.
01:46:20.72 --> 01:46:22.72 Kay goes to the wall.
01:46:22.72 --> 01:46:24.56 That's wall and talks to the guy.
01:46:24.56 --> 01:46:27.40 And I see him hand his pen out to the guy.
01:46:27.40 --> 01:46:28.40 And the guy disappears.
01:46:28.40 --> 01:46:32.48 A couple hours later, the guy returns with a small bag and passes it in.
01:46:32.48 --> 01:46:34.76 And the bag were six potatoes.
01:46:34.76 --> 01:46:40.80 So Kay had traded his valuable, crock gold cross pen for six potatoes.
01:46:40.80 --> 01:46:45.40 Had a potato cooked each day for the next six days for me.
01:46:45.40 --> 01:46:46.40 And I ate it.
01:46:46.40 --> 01:46:47.68 Kay wouldn't take any potatoes.
01:46:47.68 --> 01:46:51.48 None of the other Vietnamese senior officers would take any of the potatoes.
01:46:51.48 --> 01:46:52.76 They were from me.
01:46:52.76 --> 01:46:57.28 And just, I mean, both the physical strength the potatoes gave me.
01:46:57.28 --> 01:47:03.08 But even more importantly, just the mental lift that his sacrifice gave from me.
01:47:03.08 --> 01:47:08.52 I really brought me out of my, out of my doldrums, and gave me the spirit to go on.
01:47:08.52 --> 01:47:09.52 Unbelievable.
01:47:09.52 --> 01:47:17.32 The one more thing that happens with Kay, you're getting ready to leave the camp to go to a new camp.
01:47:17.32 --> 01:47:18.32 Right.
01:47:18.32 --> 01:47:19.32 And Kay tapped my arm.
01:47:19.32 --> 01:47:23.08 Look, he said, the curious militia guard who'd been so interested in learning about
01:47:23.08 --> 01:47:29.04 South Vietnam and America, who'd fetched my potatoes, stood there looking like a kid with
01:47:29.04 --> 01:47:30.44 a new puppy.
01:47:30.44 --> 01:47:35.36 He came close to the truck and I lean against the state side.
01:47:35.36 --> 01:47:38.36 Goodbye, he said, grinning.
01:47:38.36 --> 01:47:43.16 His simple humanity made me smile and I said, goodbye.
01:47:43.16 --> 01:47:44.92 Kay saw my astonishment.
01:47:44.92 --> 01:47:48.12 He wanted to learn to say goodbye to you when you leave.
01:47:48.12 --> 01:47:49.36 I teach him.
01:47:49.36 --> 01:47:51.36 He good man.
01:47:51.36 --> 01:47:53.48 Yes, I fought.
01:47:53.48 --> 01:47:54.84 No doubt he is.
01:47:54.84 --> 01:47:57.40 There are good men everywhere.
01:47:57.40 --> 01:48:00.92 That's the governments, the systems, the leaders that are bad.
01:48:00.92 --> 01:48:05.12 It's communism that sucks, not the people of North Vietnam.
01:48:05.12 --> 01:48:15.76 They are not so different from the South, not so different from me.
01:48:15.76 --> 01:48:19.72 I learned a lot of lessons on this trip.
01:48:19.72 --> 01:48:24.92 I learned a lot of lessons about humanity and people.
01:48:24.92 --> 01:48:30.000 I do, honestly, believe we are all God's children.
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.04 You and I had the good fortune to be born where we were born in this wonderful country
01:48:34.04 --> 01:48:36.04 of ours.
01:48:36.04 --> 01:48:40.04 Others have had the not so good fortune.
01:48:40.04 --> 01:48:48.68 I came across good people in Vietnam and he, though he was my enemy, was one.
01:48:48.68 --> 01:48:52.56 Sometimes people ask me if I have any hatred for those guys in the treatment that I got
01:48:52.56 --> 01:48:54.36 and I don't.
01:48:54.36 --> 01:49:00.44 I think they were human beings, not so different than you and me.
01:49:00.44 --> 01:49:03.16 They had their news controlled by their government.
01:49:03.16 --> 01:49:06.000 They were suffering, their strikes, and everything else.
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.16 They behaved the way that they behaved.
01:49:08.16 --> 01:49:12.48 I guess the one guy still don't care much for was it's Sue, but we'd probably get over
01:49:12.48 --> 01:49:14.60 to fight if I ever met the guy.
01:49:14.60 --> 01:49:17.12 I don't have any hatred.
01:49:17.12 --> 01:49:19.36 There's people like you and I.
01:49:19.36 --> 01:49:24.84 There was even times, I mean, we're walking through a village and now you're North Vietnam
01:49:24.84 --> 01:49:28.68 not know where what you're just talking about, they've been bombed, they lost their sons
01:49:28.68 --> 01:49:30.40 and they're trying to basically attack you.
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:32.32 They're throwing rocks at you.
01:49:32.32 --> 01:49:36.08 And the guys that are guarding you actually, I don't think they shot at them, but they
01:49:36.08 --> 01:49:40.04 fired over their heads to protect you.
01:49:40.04 --> 01:49:43.04 Which I'd found to be in my South Vietnamese friends.
01:49:43.04 --> 01:49:45.80 I mean, you'll talk to people who have the experience in the Vietnam war and you get all
01:49:45.80 --> 01:49:52.04 kinds of different opinions of the South Vietnamese and good worthless whatever.
01:49:52.04 --> 01:49:54.20 They have all varieties like we are.
01:49:54.20 --> 01:49:58.84 There are some that, violently and bravely, like the guys at Firebase Charlie, the people
01:49:58.84 --> 01:50:02.88 that I was with as a prisoner of war were great human beings.
01:50:02.88 --> 01:50:07.08 When we'd get attacked, yeah, the first thing they put me and they, the Communist Guards,
01:50:07.08 --> 01:50:10.32 it's took me in the middle, but then the South Vietnamese willingly would form perimeter
01:50:10.32 --> 01:50:19.16 around me and then the guards are on the outside firing as necessary all to protect me.
01:50:19.16 --> 01:50:24.88 One time going back to book, the guards start screaming, be num, hey, be num, hey.
01:50:24.88 --> 01:50:26.88 Bonham, bonham, hi.
01:50:26.88 --> 01:50:27.88 Bonham, hi.
01:50:27.88 --> 01:50:32.08 Which means, bb, num, five, hi, too.
01:50:32.08 --> 01:50:36.92 And for those of you that don't translate that real quick, that's b 52.
01:50:36.92 --> 01:50:43.000 The bombs drop, hundreds of bombs fell, all around us, big bombs, nearly on top of us.
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.24 I knew there was little chance of living through a B 52 strike, but by the grace of God
01:50:47.24 --> 01:50:49.68 no bombs fell in our crater.
01:50:49.68 --> 01:50:54.96 The earth trembled at shook, it ruptured and heaved, waves of crushing pressure blasted
01:50:54.96 --> 01:51:00.44 through a squeezing, hurting my head in the ears, the suffocating pressure was painful, awful,
01:51:00.44 --> 01:51:01.44 frightening.
01:51:01.44 --> 01:51:03.44 It stopped.
01:51:03.44 --> 01:51:07.000 I was crying, I was dead, I knew it.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.20 I felt ringing in my ears, froping in my head.
01:51:10.20 --> 01:51:12.32 I must be alive.
01:51:12.32 --> 01:51:16.80 Next to me, the officer sat up and holstered his pistol, by the way, you had the guy drawn
01:51:16.80 --> 01:51:22.56 his pistol and held it to your head to make sure he was going to escape during the B 52 strike.
01:51:22.56 --> 01:51:28.24 K was moving, others began setting up days, but alive, no one could hear.
01:51:28.24 --> 01:51:29.24 No one spoke.
01:51:29.24 --> 01:51:33.88 We crawled out of the hole and started walking in direction we'd been traveling.
01:51:33.88 --> 01:51:35.36 This was in North Vietnam.
01:51:35.36 --> 01:51:39.48 We'd come upon an area of a lot of bomb craters, they'd been bomb frequently.
01:51:39.48 --> 01:51:42.08 The enemy shot two anti-aircraft rounds.
01:51:42.08 --> 01:51:43.24 That seemed to be their signal.
01:51:43.24 --> 01:51:45.88 Two rounds was an air strike.
01:51:45.88 --> 01:51:51.96 The other started shouting, bottom high and all hell broke loose upon us.
01:51:51.96 --> 01:51:55.36 Now you get to Hanoi, right?
01:51:55.36 --> 01:52:00.36 And you get a bed, a board, okay, a board.
01:52:00.36 --> 01:52:01.68 There's a blanket though.
01:52:01.68 --> 01:52:06.40 There was a blanket, it gets cold and a French bread.
01:52:06.40 --> 01:52:09.000 That's how you call it, French bread.
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000 I was in New York.
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.48 It's like a small piece of French bread is what it looked like.
01:52:13.48 --> 01:52:18.56 But it was just, I mean, it was kind of half rotten and pieces of rock and stick and
01:52:18.56 --> 01:52:19.56 junk and it was just...
01:52:19.56 --> 01:52:21.000 It's what he even did the book.
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.08 Because when you first talk about the French bread, you French bread, and then it cl-
01:52:24.08 --> 01:52:25.08 It's a real grunt here.
01:52:25.08 --> 01:52:29.08 It's a couple of parrots, or maybe a couple pages later you're saying there was bugs.
01:52:29.08 --> 01:52:30.08 And he sticks.
01:52:30.08 --> 01:52:33.72 But when you first got that French bread, the first I was putting solitary confinement
01:52:33.72 --> 01:52:35.72 my first prison and I was brought a meal.
01:52:35.72 --> 01:52:39.48 And now the whole time I was captured down in the jungle, we got a ball of great, a great
01:52:39.48 --> 01:52:42.56 fruit-sized ball of rice in the morning, a great fruit-sized ball of rice in the evening
01:52:42.56 --> 01:52:43.56 for our food.
01:52:43.56 --> 01:52:46.36 That's what we got hiking up the Hoachman Trail.
01:52:46.36 --> 01:52:50.96 We would, in the evenings, they would cook rice that the communist would and we would get
01:52:50.96 --> 01:52:55.68 about that same equivalent of our ball size of rice and then we would roll up a ball to eat
01:52:55.68 --> 01:52:58.32 during the journey on the next morning.
01:52:58.32 --> 01:53:01.52 So it was the same thing, two great-sized balls of rice a day.
01:53:01.52 --> 01:53:09.28 That's all that I had with an occasional piece of man-yuck and maybe some, oh, what
01:53:09.28 --> 01:53:11.24 they had to do, they call it.
01:53:11.24 --> 01:53:12.24 Bamboo shoot.
01:53:12.24 --> 01:53:13.84 A case of almost ages of rice.
01:53:13.84 --> 01:53:14.84 So I get to Henoie.
01:53:14.84 --> 01:53:16.44 I'm in solitary confinement.
01:53:16.44 --> 01:53:21.44 They bring me a meal.
01:53:21.44 --> 01:53:24.52 They're played at being spraised with this piece of French bread on the side.
01:53:24.52 --> 01:53:26.32 And I'm sitting there for a lot of reasons.
01:53:26.32 --> 01:53:27.72 I mean, I knew that I was in Henoie.
01:53:27.72 --> 01:53:33.000 I knew that this horrible trip of walking every single day and not knowing how I was going
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000 to survive through that day.
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000 All that was over.
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000 I'm here.
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000 I'm in Henoie.
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.92 Oh, plus they'd give me a bath and gave me a prison uniform and shave me.
01:53:41.92 --> 01:53:43.72 I mean, I had not shaved the whole time.
01:53:43.72 --> 01:53:47.28 So I've been a prisoner for months.
01:53:47.28 --> 01:53:49.000 And I sat there and they brought that food.
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000 And I did.
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000 I cried.
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000 Tears rolled down my cheeks.
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.40 I knew for the first time, since I was shot down, there was no doubt in my mind.
01:53:57.40 --> 01:53:59.16 I was going to survive.
01:53:59.16 --> 01:54:00.16 That was no longer a question.
01:54:00.16 --> 01:54:01.92 All I had to do was gut out those last.
01:54:01.92 --> 01:54:04.16 However long it was going to be in Henoie.
01:54:04.16 --> 01:54:09.28 They had given me this wonderful food of bean sprouts and this piece of crappy French bread.
01:54:09.28 --> 01:54:11.72 But it was wonderful.
01:54:11.72 --> 01:54:15.24 That's beautiful.
01:54:15.24 --> 01:54:21.76 And here's, as this continues here in Henoie, I'm going back to the book.
01:54:21.76 --> 01:54:25.000 I stood in a cell about 12 feet wide and 25 feet long.
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000 Six bunks lined up to my right.
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.56 Head and against the wall.
01:54:29.56 --> 01:54:31.68 Two others lay lengthwise against the wall to my left.
01:54:31.68 --> 01:54:37.16 The bunks were three by six foot pieces of wood resting on saw horses of the same width.
01:54:37.16 --> 01:54:38.64 He chose covered with a bamboo mat.
01:54:38.64 --> 01:54:41.000 A blanket neatly folded on one end.
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.16 When we in the bunk or my left I saw two buckets just like the one in my, one's in my solitary
01:54:45.16 --> 01:54:46.16 cells.
01:54:46.16 --> 01:54:53.24 A row of three small window slits six by 18 inches opened high at the back at the top of
01:54:53.24 --> 01:54:55.24 the back wall.
01:54:55.24 --> 01:54:58.12 Seven sets of eyes fixed on me.
01:54:58.12 --> 01:55:01.000 One approached and put out his hand.
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.04 I'm John Murphy, captain, Air Force.
01:55:05.04 --> 01:55:07.12 How you doing?
01:55:07.12 --> 01:55:09.12 Americans.
01:55:09.12 --> 01:55:12.12 They're a room full of Americans.
01:55:12.12 --> 01:55:15.68 Oh God bless you.
01:55:15.68 --> 01:55:19.12 And that's your, your with these other prisoners.
01:55:19.12 --> 01:55:24.12 And I hadn't seen another American since I split up from that group all that time ago
01:55:24.12 --> 01:55:25.12 on the trail.
01:55:25.12 --> 01:55:28.12 It was a glorious moment to come out of solitary confinement.
01:55:28.12 --> 01:55:31.36 We put in a room with seven other guys.
01:55:31.36 --> 01:55:34.68 And you know this is one of the things that I talked about you as we were getting ready
01:55:34.68 --> 01:55:37.04 to record.
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:38.68 I said, look.
01:55:38.68 --> 01:55:43.24 I want to read your entire book on this podcast because it's so good.
01:55:43.24 --> 01:55:45.12 And nobody's going to want to go buy the book.
01:55:45.12 --> 01:55:50.52 I just heard the whole book read and one of the decisions that I made was one of the
01:55:50.52 --> 01:55:54.40 things that you do in here is this is a book about you.
01:55:54.40 --> 01:56:01.64 But you do a wonderful and a beautiful job of describing and telling the stories of all
01:56:01.64 --> 01:56:05.04 these other heroes that you're with.
01:56:05.04 --> 01:56:09.48 And as a matter of fact, you call this chapter chapter 12 in the company of heroes with
01:56:09.48 --> 01:56:12.60 all these other Americans that you know, you told me on the way over here and you talk
01:56:12.60 --> 01:56:13.60 about it in the book.
01:56:13.60 --> 01:56:16.44 You'd been in you were there for at this point.
01:56:16.44 --> 01:56:19.60 What six months were you there at this point seven months?
01:56:19.60 --> 01:56:21.52 Yeah, something like that.
01:56:21.52 --> 01:56:28.36 Some of these guys had been in captivity for three years five years seven years.
01:56:28.36 --> 01:56:29.36 Seven years.
01:56:29.36 --> 01:56:32.04 And then the one guy I talked about in their gym tops and have been a prisoner for nine
01:56:32.04 --> 01:56:33.04 years.
01:56:33.04 --> 01:56:35.64 I felt I needed to do that in this book.
01:56:35.64 --> 01:56:38.52 I had some real mixed feelings about writing this book.
01:56:38.52 --> 01:56:43.24 I didn't want to do a book focused, you know, this happened to me story and I did all
01:56:43.24 --> 01:56:44.24 this great stuff.
01:56:44.24 --> 01:56:45.96 I know I suffered.
01:56:45.96 --> 01:56:49.32 But there were so many other prisoners from this Southern experience.
01:56:49.32 --> 01:56:52.32 That's a story I wanted to tell this different Southern experience.
01:56:52.32 --> 01:56:55.60 It's different than the prisoners who were shot down in capture in the north.
01:56:55.60 --> 01:57:00.000 So many of these guys, many many of these guys suffered so much more than I did.
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.76 So much more time and captivity than I did.
01:57:02.76 --> 01:57:06.96 So I do share those stories of those guys in the company of heroes.
01:57:06.96 --> 01:57:11.92 When I got to Hanoi, got into the prison of plantation gardens, I met these other guys
01:57:11.92 --> 01:57:16.32 and they had the truly incredible heroic stories to share.
01:57:16.32 --> 01:57:24.60 And you do a phenomenal job in the book of describing them who they were, what they've
01:57:24.60 --> 01:57:26.08 been through.
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:28.76 Bill Gont, Al Krabov.
01:57:28.76 --> 01:57:33.84 John Parcell's Bill Thomas Bill Henderson Dave Mott.
01:57:33.84 --> 01:57:35.64 Just you go through the guys.
01:57:35.64 --> 01:57:38.08 Now those are the guys of my cell and I don't know if you got any of them.
01:57:38.08 --> 01:57:39.08 I don't know if you got any of them.
01:57:39.08 --> 01:57:40.52 They're out of the eight guys in the cell.
01:57:40.52 --> 01:57:41.92 Four of us were named Bill.
01:57:41.92 --> 01:57:42.92 That's just crazy.
01:57:42.92 --> 01:57:46.88 Eight Americans in a cell and four of us named Bill.
01:57:46.88 --> 01:57:49.88 So I became new Bill.
01:57:49.88 --> 01:57:53.44 There was a Bill Gant was an Air Force pilot, about 6465.
01:57:53.44 --> 01:57:55.000 He was big Bill.
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.48 There was a Marine War officer who was some prehistoric elderly gentleman.
01:57:58.48 --> 01:58:01.24 The poor guy was 36 years old.
01:58:01.24 --> 01:58:07.12 We couldn't believe he'd survived, but he was old Bill and then we had an Air Force OV10
01:58:07.12 --> 01:58:08.56 pilot who became young Bill.
01:58:08.56 --> 01:58:11.24 So we had four Bills out of the eight guys.
01:58:11.24 --> 01:58:13.36 But yeah, then the others.
01:58:13.36 --> 01:58:19.000 And those guys had all suffered too, but then there were other guys in the camp.
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:26.92 Shoot Dennis Thompson and Harvey Brand, two special forces guys, Captain Longway.
01:58:26.92 --> 01:58:29.64 There are experiences, so many others.
01:58:29.64 --> 01:58:33.96 Five guys, but TV station in a way, who are capturing a tent.
01:58:33.96 --> 01:58:38.64 I mean, who would think that a TV radio station, TV station crew would get capture,
01:58:38.64 --> 01:58:41.92 but they had all of their trials and tribulations.
01:58:41.92 --> 01:58:47.16 And then the most was Jim Thompson in his nine years of suffering as a prisoner of
01:58:47.16 --> 01:58:48.16 one.
01:58:48.16 --> 01:58:52.28 One of the guys I do want to highlight is Colonel Ted Guy.
01:58:52.28 --> 01:58:53.28 Some would go to the book.
01:58:53.28 --> 01:58:55.28 Yeah, our senior ranking officer.
01:58:55.28 --> 01:58:59.12 And someone's briefing you kind of telling you what's going on.
01:58:59.12 --> 01:59:02.72 And here's what Dave says, Dave Maup.
01:59:02.72 --> 01:59:09.28 He says, the SRO, that's the senior ranking officer for the camp is Colonel Ted Guy.
01:59:09.28 --> 01:59:11.92 He's in the shed up on top of the camp.
01:59:11.92 --> 01:59:16.000 That's where they've segregated the senior officers and NCOs from the rest of us.
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.16 He's an Air Force lieutenant colonel who must have been promoted to Fulberg by now.
01:59:20.16 --> 01:59:23.96 He went down over Laos in an F4 in 1968.
01:59:23.96 --> 01:59:26.36 He's a good leader and a real hard ass.
01:59:26.36 --> 01:59:27.92 He runs a tight ship.
01:59:27.92 --> 01:59:31.12 Doesn't allow making any propaganda statements.
01:59:31.12 --> 01:59:33.40 No one can accept early release.
01:59:33.40 --> 01:59:36.60 We live by the code of conduct.
01:59:36.60 --> 01:59:39.80 He's taken a lot of beatings and torture for us.
01:59:39.80 --> 01:59:41.96 We call him the Hawk.
01:59:41.96 --> 01:59:44.48 Alcraboth jumped in immediately.
01:59:44.48 --> 01:59:47.08 Yeah, and we're Hawk's heroes.
01:59:47.08 --> 01:59:51.48 Just like Hogan's heroes on the TV show, only we don't have as much fun.
01:59:51.48 --> 01:59:54.08 He had a shitty eating grin on his face.
01:59:54.08 --> 01:59:57.96 He also looked like crap.
01:59:57.96 --> 02:00:03.60 So that's, I thought it was, that's one of the, you know, you, again, you go through all
02:00:03.60 --> 02:00:06.000 these guys and what they've done.
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.76 And you also talk about, you talk about some of those heroes that held the line and
02:00:10.76 --> 02:00:15.64 you also talk about another group who I'll go to here.
02:00:15.64 --> 02:00:18.60 Sometimes I could hear a lot of noise from the other side of the wall separating our
02:00:18.60 --> 02:00:23.04 road sales from those on the further end of our building.
02:00:23.04 --> 02:00:28.60 I could see the top of a basketball hoop, an occasional volleyball arched high over
02:00:28.60 --> 02:00:31.24 an out of sight net.
02:00:31.24 --> 02:00:32.24 What's up with that?
02:00:32.24 --> 02:00:34.60 I asked, that's the peace committee.
02:00:34.60 --> 02:00:35.60 Came the answer.
02:00:35.60 --> 02:00:37.24 What's the peace committee?
02:00:37.24 --> 02:00:40.60 Eight guys who collaborate with the enemy.
02:00:40.60 --> 02:00:43.24 They've been ordered to stop, but they won't.
02:00:43.24 --> 02:00:48.56 They study communism, do propaganda, make radio broadcasts, even rat on the
02:00:48.56 --> 02:00:50.60 other Americans.
02:00:50.60 --> 02:00:55.000 For that, they get packages, get to write letters, and can go outside whenever they
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.48 won and play games.
02:00:57.48 --> 02:01:02.08 We call them the ducks because the way they followed, followed the guards around and
02:01:02.08 --> 02:01:04.000 do their bidding.
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.16 They'll rotten hell, I said, that they will.
02:01:08.16 --> 02:01:12.96 The collaborators were, but a small but significant minority among us.
02:01:12.96 --> 02:01:18.64 There were 107 prisoners at plantation gardens and except for the eight in the peace committee,
02:01:18.64 --> 02:01:24.12 all were patriotic loyal Americans who resisted enemy interrogations, propaganda, and pressure
02:01:24.12 --> 02:01:27.60 to sign statements and make radio broadcasts.
02:01:27.60 --> 02:01:32.68 We resisted with everything we had.
02:01:32.68 --> 02:01:35.12 And then, you know, you got time.
02:01:35.12 --> 02:01:37.000 Time those guys back to Colonel Guy.
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.84 I can't say enough about Colonel Guy.
02:01:38.84 --> 02:01:41.60 He's passed away several years ago now.
02:01:41.60 --> 02:01:44.60 So what a strong leader.
02:01:44.60 --> 02:01:49.92 And we talk about military discipline in the requirement for it in officers' instances
02:01:49.92 --> 02:01:57.68 at what in prison camp, that discipline was so essential and so sought after by everyone.
02:01:57.68 --> 02:02:02.12 We were lucky to have Colonel Guy as our senior ranking officer.
02:02:02.12 --> 02:02:08.44 He was so tough and by the rules and the code and thank goodness because that's what we all
02:02:08.44 --> 02:02:13.48 needed to hear and to have that standard to live by.
02:02:13.48 --> 02:02:16.20 Just a great and wonderful human being.
02:02:16.20 --> 02:02:20.92 When we got back, you know, there was several who would have strangled some of those peace
02:02:20.92 --> 02:02:24.76 committee guys, especially some of our special forces guys were captured with us.
02:02:24.76 --> 02:02:29.08 But Colonel Guy put out an order and he said, this is a direct order.
02:02:29.08 --> 02:02:31.20 Everyone stay away from the peace committee.
02:02:31.20 --> 02:02:32.88 I'm going to take care of this.
02:02:32.88 --> 02:02:33.88 I got it.
02:02:33.88 --> 02:02:36.000 Don't you do anything.
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.76 Colonel Guy pressed charges against the peace committee again and again was overridden.
02:02:40.76 --> 02:02:42.40 Charges were never brought against them.
02:02:42.40 --> 02:02:47.88 But what did happen is Colonel Guy's career was was curtailed far before it should have been.
02:02:47.88 --> 02:02:52.68 But I have the deepest respect for him as our senior officer.
02:02:52.68 --> 02:02:53.68 Yeah.
02:02:53.68 --> 02:02:56.52 And again, I'm going to say this again.
02:02:56.52 --> 02:03:01.000 You go through these stories of some of the other heroes.
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.16 You just mentioned Dennis Thomas.
02:03:03.16 --> 02:03:06.64 Absolutely.
02:03:06.64 --> 02:03:07.64 Bill Murray.
02:03:07.64 --> 02:03:12.84 I mean, you just you go through these stories and then they're just all phenomenal and you
02:03:12.84 --> 02:03:17.64 do them such such an honor telling their stories.
02:03:17.64 --> 02:03:23.08 So by this book so that you can read these stories because I don't have time to go through
02:03:23.08 --> 02:03:25.16 them all here.
02:03:25.16 --> 02:03:29.20 The one thing I want to point out though is going back to the book.
02:03:29.20 --> 02:03:34.96 We also try to keep our humor going within the cell and Alan me as the central culprit's
02:03:34.96 --> 02:03:37.92 telling, disgustingly bad jokes back and forth.
02:03:37.92 --> 02:03:40.20 Al was getting a lot better.
02:03:40.20 --> 02:03:42.16 His nausea was subsiding because he was really sick.
02:03:42.16 --> 02:03:45.04 His naughty were subsiding in his boils healing.
02:03:45.04 --> 02:03:49.000 Some of the guys exercised to fight the deterioration of their bodies.
02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.28 I couldn't even lie on my back, let alone trying to do sit-ups.
02:03:53.28 --> 02:03:58.84 What I could do was try to get into a position to try push-ups.
02:03:58.84 --> 02:04:01.000 I tried once in the jungle and failed.
02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.40 I couldn't raise myself up off the ground.
02:04:03.40 --> 02:04:07.72 Now I was able to push all the way up once and halfway through a second.
02:04:07.72 --> 02:04:10.96 Pretty sad for a guy who could do a hundred push-ups before.
02:04:10.96 --> 02:04:17.68 I kept at for at it for weeks until I was able to do several as part of my daily routine.
02:04:17.68 --> 02:04:22.20 And the reason I point that out is because I always say, you know, because people get injured,
02:04:22.20 --> 02:04:24.64 people come with sickness, do what you can.
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:25.64 Yes.
02:04:25.64 --> 02:04:26.64 And do what you can.
02:04:26.64 --> 02:04:30.16 And that's exactly what you are doing.
02:04:30.16 --> 02:04:35.16 So, so important.
02:04:35.16 --> 02:04:40.86 December 18th, 1972 after many weeks of quiet, we got bombed like none of us had ever
02:04:40.86 --> 02:04:42.26 been bombed before.
02:04:42.26 --> 02:04:46.96 Air raid sirens, wailed, barrages of Sam's fire and bombs poured down.
02:04:46.96 --> 02:04:50.48 American B-52s had arrived in force over and away.
02:04:50.48 --> 02:04:53.64 Bombs fell close and plantation garden shook.
02:04:53.64 --> 02:04:57.72 We lay on our bunk, hoping our bombers knew where our camp was.
02:04:57.72 --> 02:05:03.04 Still, we fell back into a mindset we'd all developed in captivity.
02:05:03.04 --> 02:05:05.76 What will be will be?
02:05:05.76 --> 02:05:07.08 No sense of worrying about something.
02:05:07.08 --> 02:05:09.72 You absolutely have no control over which is.
02:05:09.72 --> 02:05:14.52 Yeah, of course we're not going to stop a bomb from landing on our head.
02:05:14.52 --> 02:05:19.92 That was the Christmas bombing in 1972 that Nixon ordered to finally bring the communist
02:05:19.92 --> 02:05:21.92 to the bargaining table.
02:05:21.92 --> 02:05:28.68 And I had to put this part in here, I had to read it.
02:05:28.68 --> 02:05:32.80 So after those, after that massive bombing, repercussion.
02:05:32.80 --> 02:05:35.64 So there's a guard that you, that you had nicknamed repercussion.
02:05:35.64 --> 02:05:40.52 Repregution, a guard so named because of his violent outbursts and threats against prisoners
02:05:40.52 --> 02:05:44.64 stood against the wall as we milled around the water trough.
02:05:44.64 --> 02:05:46.36 He spoke something, Lish.
02:05:46.36 --> 02:05:51.88 Old Bill Thomas walked over to him and said, you think those air strikes were bad?
02:05:51.88 --> 02:05:53.88 What the guard asked?
02:05:53.88 --> 02:05:58.88 You think those air strikes were bad last night, Bill said again, yes, bad bombing.
02:05:58.88 --> 02:06:01.44 Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
02:06:01.44 --> 02:06:06.96 Way to lay drop an A-bomb on your fucking ass.
02:06:06.96 --> 02:06:09.68 I gasped and smiled, old Bill Proud Marine.
02:06:09.68 --> 02:06:11.92 He'd been pretty quiet guy, but not me more.
02:06:11.92 --> 02:06:14.36 We all glowed inside after the bombing.
02:06:14.36 --> 02:06:16.08 It was a huge morale boost.
02:06:16.08 --> 02:06:19.44 The bombings went all night after night, not without impunity.
02:06:19.44 --> 02:06:23.92 The B-52s got shot down, their ghastly giant carcasses burning, falling.
02:06:23.92 --> 02:06:26.32 We wondered sadly about the fate of the crews.
02:06:26.32 --> 02:06:29.36 We lost their craft yet they kept coming.
02:06:29.36 --> 02:06:31.80 Quietly, we cheered them on.
02:06:31.80 --> 02:06:34.52 Yeah, that was a huge morale boost.
02:06:34.52 --> 02:06:38.24 And Bill Thomas, boy, bless us hard, because he was always kind of a quiet guy, but he just
02:06:38.24 --> 02:06:40.72 let it all out that morning.
02:06:40.72 --> 02:06:43.32 That's so awesome.
02:06:43.32 --> 02:06:47.52 Okay, now we're in the, in the Hanoi, the infamous.
02:06:47.52 --> 02:06:50.24 Yeah, they moved us into middle of all that bombing attacks.
02:06:50.24 --> 02:06:53.84 They loaded us up one night on trucks at the plantation garden, drove around.
02:06:53.84 --> 02:06:55.44 I don't know, it seemed like for a couple hours.
02:06:55.44 --> 02:06:56.80 I think they were just trying to disorient us.
02:06:56.80 --> 02:06:59.52 We thought their tickets out in the country because of the bombings.
02:06:59.52 --> 02:07:01.84 And then they came to a stop and we got out of the trucks.
02:07:01.84 --> 02:07:08.48 And finally, we're only a few blower several blocks where we started at the Hanoi Hill.
02:07:08.48 --> 02:07:11.12 And now they set up like a little movie night for you guys.
02:07:11.12 --> 02:07:12.12 Oh, yeah.
02:07:12.12 --> 02:07:17.64 So, I've heard for the at the Hanoi Hill, my little movie night, and they set you down
02:07:17.64 --> 02:07:20.16 for the movie night.
02:07:20.16 --> 02:07:22.20 You guys are making fun of the projector operator.
02:07:22.20 --> 02:07:25.04 And finally, they tell you quiet, no talk.
02:07:25.04 --> 02:07:26.76 And then the movie starts back to the book.
02:07:26.76 --> 02:07:30.96 The film was of Jane Fonda visiting North Vietnam.
02:07:30.96 --> 02:07:37.52 We saw an American converting among the enemy leadership supporting their cause.
02:07:37.52 --> 02:07:43.48 Jane's appeared of her climbing into the Gunner seat on an NVA anti-aircraft gun wearing
02:07:43.48 --> 02:07:50.96 a clean white blouse, smiling broadly, laughing, donning a North Vietnamese army helmet with
02:07:50.96 --> 02:07:57.12 live ammunition at her feet that would later shoot down American planes.
02:07:57.12 --> 02:08:03.40 In the film, she sent a message to American servicemen calling us war criminals.
02:08:03.40 --> 02:08:08.04 She said we were following the orders of other war criminals that were like the leaders
02:08:08.04 --> 02:08:15.48 of Germany and Japan and World War II who were executed for their crimes.
02:08:15.48 --> 02:08:16.64 I was stunned.
02:08:16.64 --> 02:08:21.40 We didn't dare speak out loud, but we had plenty to say to each other when we got back
02:08:21.40 --> 02:08:23.72 inside our cell.
02:08:23.72 --> 02:08:27.80 Days later, they showed us some news clippings from American newspapers and magazines.
02:08:27.80 --> 02:08:31.16 They all had news of war protests.
02:08:31.16 --> 02:08:38.24 One was former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark demanding that American stop bombing North
02:08:38.24 --> 02:08:41.24 Vietnamese sit dikes.
02:08:41.24 --> 02:08:45.12 He had been Attorney General under President Johnson during the buildup of American forces
02:08:45.12 --> 02:08:46.12 in Vietnam.
02:08:46.12 --> 02:08:50.80 Now he was making statements from a noise that was inhumane to bomb dikes and that we
02:08:50.80 --> 02:08:52.76 should never do it again.
02:08:52.76 --> 02:08:57.60 A photo showed him standing beside a dike with a single bomb crater.
02:08:57.60 --> 02:09:01.20 I knew he did not have an air campaign to destroy the dikes.
02:09:01.20 --> 02:09:04.20 This was an airant bomb.
02:09:04.20 --> 02:09:07.68 The war protesters at home never bothered me.
02:09:07.68 --> 02:09:13.66 In fact, I took pride in fighting communism in this far corner of the earth so Americans
02:09:13.66 --> 02:09:17.44 could have the right to protest in the streets.
02:09:17.44 --> 02:09:24.16 It was a sacred honor to defend the right of other Americans to disagree with me or anything
02:09:24.16 --> 02:09:29.16 within our American system of government.
02:09:29.16 --> 02:09:34.04 I do believe that so strongly.
02:09:34.04 --> 02:09:40.04 The core of our democracy is not that we all get in line and march forth.
02:09:40.04 --> 02:09:42.24 Take us to 1984.
02:09:42.24 --> 02:09:46.04 The strength of our American democracy is that we can have different views and people disagree
02:09:46.04 --> 02:09:48.04 in the health of the democracy.
02:09:48.04 --> 02:09:53.92 When those disagreements can be argued and discussed and then you reach a solution,
02:09:53.92 --> 02:09:57.20 they are a democratic solution and you go forward.
02:09:57.20 --> 02:09:58.80 That's the beauty of our system.
02:09:58.80 --> 02:10:00.44 Never mind even during the war.
02:10:00.44 --> 02:10:02.44 People say, oh, isn't this horrible?
02:10:02.44 --> 02:10:05.44 These guys, no, exactly what I said there.
02:10:05.44 --> 02:10:11.36 The riot fighting is an American soldier to defend the American way of life which is democratic
02:10:11.36 --> 02:10:13.24 disagreement and arguments.
02:10:13.24 --> 02:10:14.24 They have had it guys.
02:10:14.24 --> 02:10:15.44 You want to protest.
02:10:15.44 --> 02:10:17.44 Go protest.
02:10:17.44 --> 02:10:18.84 Beautiful.
02:10:18.84 --> 02:10:26.12 Now you, I'm going to go to the book.
02:10:26.12 --> 02:10:33.40 We join the rest of our cellmates and press close to Jose.
02:10:33.40 --> 02:10:34.40 And Zaldua.
02:10:34.40 --> 02:10:35.40 And Zaldua.
02:10:35.40 --> 02:10:39.80 A Tom Marine, a Tom Marine Corporal captured a couple years before.
02:10:39.80 --> 02:10:43.12 He quietly related what he'd gathered from the broadcast.
02:10:43.12 --> 02:10:44.40 So he was a translator.
02:10:44.40 --> 02:10:45.40 He was e-stropping.
02:10:45.40 --> 02:10:46.40 Listen, they're very translated.
02:10:46.40 --> 02:10:48.52 One of the guards was out in the courtyard playing a radio.
02:10:48.52 --> 02:10:49.52 It's never did.
02:10:49.52 --> 02:10:50.52 I never heard them.
02:10:50.52 --> 02:10:52.04 But obviously there was some important news coming.
02:10:52.04 --> 02:10:56.20 So his guard had a radio out in the courtyard listening and Jose heard what was said on
02:10:56.20 --> 02:10:57.20 the radio.
02:10:57.20 --> 02:11:01.40 And he says it sounded like a piece of agreement was signed and the war is ended.
02:11:01.40 --> 02:11:05.000 And you kind of get that confirmed.
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000 Back to the book.
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.56 That afternoon, we were taken into the courtyard with our fellow plantation garden prisoners
02:11:09.56 --> 02:11:11.16 from the cell next door.
02:11:11.16 --> 02:11:16.12 Film crews stood behind a couple of big old funky cameras set up on tripods.
02:11:16.12 --> 02:11:20.24 We stood and rose as instructed waiting for whatever might come.
02:11:20.24 --> 02:11:22.60 And order passed through the ranks.
02:11:22.60 --> 02:11:29.000 Hawke says if it's good news, no reaction, no smiles, no shouting, nothing for propaganda.
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000 Nope.
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000 I love that.
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.64 He's just hard to the end.
02:11:34.64 --> 02:11:37.76 And then Doc who's the camp commander.
02:11:37.76 --> 02:11:43.44 He says he looks up and says the piece of agreement is signed.
02:11:43.44 --> 02:11:45.16 You all go home.
02:11:45.16 --> 02:11:47.68 He waited for us to cheer, nothing.
02:11:47.68 --> 02:11:50.32 He looked up apologetically at the film director.
02:11:50.32 --> 02:11:52.68 Then back to us with a hint of the scowl.
02:11:52.68 --> 02:11:59.60 And he goes through the whole points of what the piece of accord has in it.
02:11:59.60 --> 02:12:05.48 And as you read the remaining highlights all faded into a dull drone, I'd heard the most
02:12:05.48 --> 02:12:06.80 important one to me.
02:12:06.80 --> 02:12:07.80 The war's over.
02:12:07.80 --> 02:12:09.96 We're going home within 60 days.
02:12:09.96 --> 02:12:11.48 I made it.
02:12:11.48 --> 02:12:13.52 Thank you, God.
02:12:13.52 --> 02:12:15.52 We went back to ourselves.
02:12:15.52 --> 02:12:22.68 Yeah, that was, that was the major why I was going to do it getting the heads up.
02:12:22.68 --> 02:12:26.64 And then we confronted the guards in the next morning and they denied, no, no, no, no.
02:12:26.64 --> 02:12:27.96 And put the other in that afternoon.
02:12:27.96 --> 02:12:30.92 We got let out in the courtyard and got the agreements read to us.
02:12:30.92 --> 02:12:33.04 What a tremendous feeling.
02:12:33.04 --> 02:12:39.44 But it was a tremendous feeling and then stop just short there because we weren't home yet.
02:12:39.44 --> 02:12:41.44 We weren't going to believe it until it happened.
02:12:41.44 --> 02:12:45.000 Still at 60 days, 60 days.
02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.32 And they actually consolidate other prisoners now.
02:12:47.32 --> 02:12:48.32 Right.
02:12:48.32 --> 02:12:49.32 They started doing releases earlier on.
02:12:49.32 --> 02:12:53.76 It was supposed to be the longest held and most seriously injured that got out first.
02:12:53.76 --> 02:12:57.36 And then the releases were going to be spaced out in several groups over a period of 60
02:12:57.36 --> 02:12:58.36 days.
02:12:58.36 --> 02:13:00.08 Back to the book here.
02:13:00.08 --> 02:13:04.48 After the new group joined us, we'd hear God awful shrieks in the middle of the
02:13:04.48 --> 02:13:05.48 night.
02:13:05.48 --> 02:13:11.40 I thought it might be Ted Gostos, an intelligence officer captured in at way in 1968.
02:13:11.40 --> 02:13:17.000 He'd been hung from ropes, denied water, severely beaten for extended periods, bashed
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.36 in the head with an AK-47 and kicked in the stomach in an effort to gain valuable intelligence
02:13:21.36 --> 02:13:23.64 he never revealed.
02:13:23.64 --> 02:13:28.84 Gostos was now a physical wreck who'd been driven to the precipice of insanity, sometimes
02:13:28.84 --> 02:13:32.40 dangling dangerously over its edge.
02:13:32.40 --> 02:13:36.72 But it wasn't Ted who was screaming in the night.
02:13:36.72 --> 02:13:39.28 It was Jim Thompson.
02:13:39.28 --> 02:13:41.28 Jim kept to himself.
02:13:41.28 --> 02:13:46.48 He was hard to get to know, but in time he began to open up to me and share some things
02:13:46.48 --> 02:13:48.12 about himself.
02:13:48.12 --> 02:13:51.92 He was only 39 years old and God he looked like hell.
02:13:51.92 --> 02:14:02.80 He'd been through more shit for a longer time than any other American soldier in history.
02:14:02.80 --> 02:14:13.52 And nine years, and you do a beautiful job of recounting the story that he told you.
02:14:13.52 --> 02:14:21.36 So this is the first person, the first person report of what happened.
02:14:21.36 --> 02:14:31.84 And again, it's an incredible, incredibly horrifying and heroic story that everybody needs
02:14:31.84 --> 02:14:34.12 to read about.
02:14:34.12 --> 02:14:40.12 And when he finishes telling you the story of how what he'd been through up to that point,
02:14:40.12 --> 02:14:45.68 I'm going back to book, I looked into his eyes and saw a troubled soul.
02:14:45.68 --> 02:14:53.52 He survived captivity for nearly nine years longer than any other American soldier in history.
02:14:53.52 --> 02:14:56.56 He did take in a lot from him.
02:14:56.56 --> 02:15:00.20 My God, Jim, that's incredible, I said.
02:15:00.20 --> 02:15:03.64 He smiled weekly and looked down.
02:15:03.64 --> 02:15:08.12 Prisoner releases began a few days later.
02:15:08.12 --> 02:15:10.72 Jim is truly an unsung American hero.
02:15:10.72 --> 02:15:14.36 Most Americans don't even know of him.
02:15:14.36 --> 02:15:21.68 The longest held American prisoner, military prisoner of war in history.
02:15:21.68 --> 02:15:24.76 I mean, most people don't know much about the Vietnam War anyway.
02:15:24.76 --> 02:15:28.52 There's not very much taught in our history books or classes, but those who do know
02:15:28.52 --> 02:15:32.84 something about the Vietnam War, if you ask them who the longest held prisoner was, they
02:15:32.84 --> 02:15:37.24 will respond Navy Lieutenant Ev Alvarez.
02:15:37.24 --> 02:15:42.84 Lieutenant Alvarez was the longest held prisoner shot down over North Vietnam.
02:15:42.84 --> 02:15:46.52 He was not the longest held prisoner from the Vietnam War.
02:15:46.52 --> 02:15:52.56 Jim Thompson has several months more time and captivity than Ev Alvarez.
02:15:52.56 --> 02:15:59.04 So I don't want to take anything away from Alvarez, but Jim never got the recognition
02:15:59.04 --> 02:16:00.04 really.
02:16:00.04 --> 02:16:02.76 I mean, it's been mentioned here and there, but as far as people realizing and giving
02:16:02.76 --> 02:16:08.76 him the honor that he deserved, never received that as being the longest held American
02:16:08.76 --> 02:16:11.12 military prisoner in history.
02:16:11.12 --> 02:16:13.56 And he's passed away now, a regrettable.
02:16:13.56 --> 02:16:16.88 Well, we will do our best to spread that word on here.
02:16:16.88 --> 02:16:24.40 I've actually ordered a book about him and I will make sure I spread the word to the best
02:16:24.40 --> 02:16:30.56 of my ability about his service in sacrifice and heroism.
02:16:30.56 --> 02:16:37.76 And the way you do it in here is an incredible tribute to what he went through as well.
02:16:37.76 --> 02:16:41.40 Now the days go by.
02:16:41.40 --> 02:16:44.68 They finally get you to pack up your gear.
02:16:44.68 --> 02:16:49.68 Give you some new clothes, put you on a bus, and take you out.
02:16:49.68 --> 02:16:52.44 And here we go.
02:16:52.44 --> 02:16:53.44 Back to the book.
02:16:53.44 --> 02:16:56.20 We milled around for half an hour talking to one of ourselves and getting no information
02:16:56.20 --> 02:16:57.68 from the guards.
02:16:57.68 --> 02:17:01.84 The staff car returned and we were soon back on the bus.
02:17:01.84 --> 02:17:04.32 Afraid we were heading back to the Hilton.
02:17:04.32 --> 02:17:09.96 But when we came to a row of derelict hangers, we knew we must be on Hanoi's
02:17:09.96 --> 02:17:17.44 Gai Lam, Gilaam Airport, used by enemy megfighters jets throughout the war.
02:17:17.44 --> 02:17:23.48 The bus turned at a shabby hanger with a rickety control tower at its side.
02:17:23.48 --> 02:17:27.44 I beheld one of the most wondrous sights I'd ever seen.
02:17:27.44 --> 02:17:34.88 Before us was a big, shiny, beautiful C141 met a backplane parked on the ramp.
02:17:34.88 --> 02:17:39.04 The American flag and a red cross were painted high on its tail.
02:17:39.04 --> 02:17:46.32 The words, US Air Force were printed boldly on the fuselage just behind the cockpit.
02:17:46.32 --> 02:17:50.32 I cannot describe the emotion that filled me.
02:17:50.32 --> 02:17:55.44 I can't even imagine.
02:17:55.44 --> 02:17:58.24 And you guys load up.
02:17:58.24 --> 02:17:59.24 Take off.
02:17:59.24 --> 02:18:01.48 And here we go back to the book.
02:18:01.48 --> 02:18:06.000 I was happy at anxious as the big jet rolled down the runway.
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.48 Once airborne, we remained silent, absorbed in our thoughts.
02:18:10.48 --> 02:18:12.96 We seemed to be waiting for something.
02:18:12.96 --> 02:18:19.44 But none of us knew quite what it was until the pilot came on the intercom.
02:18:19.44 --> 02:18:25.44 Thought you would all like to know that we have just passed beyond Sam missile range.
02:18:25.44 --> 02:18:28.48 We erupted in a spontaneous cheer.
02:18:28.48 --> 02:18:31.000 I was overwhelmed with joy.
02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.80 It was real.
02:18:32.80 --> 02:18:34.80 We were free.
02:18:34.80 --> 02:18:38.000 We were going home.
02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.92 Nothing could stop that now.
02:18:40.92 --> 02:18:46.24 Yeah, we were really, even though we didn't consciously know it or talk about it, we
02:18:46.24 --> 02:18:53.72 didn't have the feeling that we were home free until that moment when the pilot came on
02:18:53.72 --> 02:18:56.44 it said because yeah, the missiles couldn't shoot us down.
02:18:56.44 --> 02:19:02.76 We were on our way ahead of the Philippines.
02:19:02.76 --> 02:19:05.52 I'm going to again skip through.
02:19:05.52 --> 02:19:09.40 We're running a little long on time.
02:19:09.40 --> 02:19:13.44 But one of the things I wanted to point out in here is that you got back.
02:19:13.44 --> 02:19:14.84 You're going through your in the hospital.
02:19:14.84 --> 02:19:18.04 You're going through somewhere you're recovery.
02:19:18.04 --> 02:19:21.56 You get asked to talk about taking you to talk to this group.
02:19:21.56 --> 02:19:23.24 Talk to that group and you're saying no, I don't want to talk to you.
02:19:23.24 --> 02:19:24.24 Don't want to talk to anybody.
02:19:24.24 --> 02:19:25.24 Don't want to talk to anybody.
02:19:25.24 --> 02:19:29.52 And finally, you get asked one more time and I'll go to the book.
02:19:29.52 --> 02:19:33.36 I just want to ask you please to consider one last time.
02:19:33.36 --> 02:19:38.52 This group is the Baton Corrigan or Survivors Association and they really want one of the
02:19:38.52 --> 02:19:44.28 returned Vietnam POWs to talk to them at their gathering tonight.
02:19:44.28 --> 02:19:46.000 You're the only one still here.
02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.28 I was blown away.
02:19:47.28 --> 02:19:48.28 Wait a minute.
02:19:48.28 --> 02:19:52.24 These are POWs who survived the Baton Death March and World War II and they want to hear
02:19:52.24 --> 02:19:55.24 about me after what they've been through.
02:19:55.24 --> 02:20:00.76 And of course, you agree to do it and this is the part that I wanted especially the
02:20:00.76 --> 02:20:04.48 Vets because a lot of Vets listen to this.
02:20:04.48 --> 02:20:09.44 By giving me an opportunity I couldn't refuse, they made me come out of my shell and speak
02:20:09.44 --> 02:20:12.12 publicly about what I'd been through.
02:20:12.12 --> 02:20:17.24 They opened the door to what would become the greatest therapy possible to help me deal with
02:20:17.24 --> 02:20:19.48 all that had happened to me.
02:20:19.48 --> 02:20:25.000 Many of my friends who have not been able to talk about what had happened to them have not
02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.72 re-adjusted well.
02:20:26.72 --> 02:20:31.44 Several still have major psychological issues haunting them.
02:20:31.44 --> 02:20:36.52 A couple of days later I got an invitation to speak to a high school assembly which I accepted.
02:20:36.52 --> 02:20:41.12 In the weeks and months ahead I'd be asked to talk to various groups and I'd agreed
02:20:41.12 --> 02:20:43.48 to do as many as I could.
02:20:43.48 --> 02:20:48.000 I strongly believe that the opportunity to share my experience has been one of the principal
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:53.16 reasons I've been able to readjust and deal with life as well as I have.
02:20:53.16 --> 02:21:00.56 That coupled with my faith in God, love of family and my inherently optimistic nature.
02:21:00.56 --> 02:21:04.40 Yes, yes, yes.
02:21:04.40 --> 02:21:06.04 I can't.
02:21:06.04 --> 02:21:12.24 That is probably the greatest bit of advice that comes out of this book.
02:21:12.24 --> 02:21:13.24 I mean I came back.
02:21:13.24 --> 02:21:14.64 I didn't want to talk to anybody.
02:21:14.64 --> 02:21:20.84 I didn't think anybody could understand what I had to say and I think many vets have the
02:21:20.84 --> 02:21:21.84 same feeling.
02:21:21.84 --> 02:21:23.40 Just leave me alone.
02:21:23.40 --> 02:21:28.32 I will get through this and plus you don't know what I would have experienced and you
02:21:28.32 --> 02:21:32.04 can't understand if I try to tell you about it.
02:21:32.04 --> 02:21:34.20 First of all they can understand to a degree.
02:21:34.20 --> 02:21:37.44 No one will ever be able to understand everything that you've been through but they can
02:21:37.44 --> 02:21:39.64 understand to a degree and they do want to listen.
02:21:39.64 --> 02:21:41.80 Okay, that's the receiving end.
02:21:41.80 --> 02:21:45.08 For you to be able to share your experience.
02:21:45.08 --> 02:21:52.28 And for me over the years to share my experience again and again and again and even to write
02:21:52.28 --> 02:21:57.56 this book as painful as that process was is a therapeutic process.
02:21:57.56 --> 02:22:01.64 It's a healing process to be able to talk about what you've experienced.
02:22:01.64 --> 02:22:05.52 And if you think you have demons in your mind share those demons too.
02:22:05.52 --> 02:22:06.52 Talk about it.
02:22:06.52 --> 02:22:07.80 It certainly has helped me.
02:22:07.80 --> 02:22:13.76 And I'm doing well. I've been through a lot. I'm doing well and I think a huge part of
02:22:13.76 --> 02:22:20.88 that reason is thank you survivors of botanic rigotor because I couldn't say no to you.
02:22:20.88 --> 02:22:25.16 And by doing that it got me started talking about my experience.
02:22:25.16 --> 02:22:26.16 It's totally agree.
02:22:26.16 --> 02:22:27.16 I totally agree.
02:22:27.16 --> 02:22:31.52 It's a beautiful advice.
02:22:31.52 --> 02:22:39.36 And to close out the story here, you say in the book that you greet your children at
02:22:39.36 --> 02:22:43.40 the time, you greet your children every day with good morning.
02:22:43.40 --> 02:22:46.08 It's a beautiful day.
02:22:46.08 --> 02:22:52.84 And you explain why you do that in the book.
02:22:52.84 --> 02:22:59.88 And I quote, I truly believe that every day God has given me on this earth since I came
02:22:59.88 --> 02:23:04.92 home from captivity is a beautiful day.
02:23:04.92 --> 02:23:11.72 It doesn't matter if it's raining or snowing, windy or calm, hot or cold, sunny or
02:23:11.72 --> 02:23:14.84 overcast.
02:23:14.84 --> 02:23:18.80 Every day is a gift.
02:23:18.80 --> 02:23:24.72 Every day is beautiful.
02:23:24.72 --> 02:23:29.36 And that is certainly something that I learned in war.
02:23:29.36 --> 02:23:33.20 Not as vividly as you did by any stretch.
02:23:33.20 --> 02:23:38.68 But definitely something that I know to be true and something that I talk about all the
02:23:38.68 --> 02:23:40.40 time here.
02:23:40.40 --> 02:23:54.80 That when you see that darkness, the light is much more beautiful.
02:23:54.80 --> 02:24:04.80 And you put together in this book, the eight steps to survival in a few days.
02:24:04.80 --> 02:24:10.000 And those I wrote right after I got back, the book was written just in the last several
02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.84 years with those eight steps for survival.
02:24:11.84 --> 02:24:14.88 I put those to paper shortly after I returned.
02:24:14.88 --> 02:24:20.56 And what I love about these is as I read through them here, they're not just for survival
02:24:20.56 --> 02:24:22.60 in a POW camp.
02:24:22.60 --> 02:24:23.88 They're for life.
02:24:23.88 --> 02:24:24.72 They're for life.
02:24:24.72 --> 02:24:30.24 They've been tested in the absolute harshest of conditions in a POW camp, but they
02:24:30.24 --> 02:24:32.20 can be applied to life.
02:24:32.20 --> 02:24:36.04 And it's actually things I talk about all the time.
02:24:36.04 --> 02:24:41.32 And it's amazing that they are so much alignment.
02:24:41.32 --> 02:24:44.24 Number one, e.
02:24:44.24 --> 02:24:46.32 Sound simple, doesn't it?
02:24:46.32 --> 02:24:50.40 But when you've got a forestown, nothing but plain boiled rice day after day, month after
02:24:50.40 --> 02:24:53.64 month, EDD comes a difficult chore.
02:24:53.64 --> 02:24:57.32 And I'm found death easier.
02:24:57.32 --> 02:25:00.36 Now how does that apply to life for me?
02:25:00.36 --> 02:25:06.68 Eat the right food, eat healthy foods, boom, done.
02:25:06.68 --> 02:25:10.68 You want to stay healthy.
02:25:10.68 --> 02:25:13.04 Next one, practice personal hygiene.
02:25:13.04 --> 02:25:16.64 When you are sick and starving, it's hard to motivate yourself to keep your body and
02:25:16.64 --> 02:25:18.44 surroundings clean.
02:25:18.44 --> 02:25:22.76 Do the best you can with what you have.
02:25:22.76 --> 02:25:28.84 No fleets to disease and disease leads to death.
02:25:28.84 --> 02:25:36.44 And again, for me to apply this to life, this is about discipline and this is about routine.
02:25:36.44 --> 02:25:42.000 And this is about pride and maintaining those things.
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.32 And even, you know, we've talked about one of those stories I talk about on here is the
02:25:46.32 --> 02:25:51.96 Russians fighting the chasions and one of the things that in the debriefs and the post-operational
02:25:51.96 --> 02:25:55.48 debriefs when they lost that first push down there.
02:25:55.48 --> 02:25:58.84 They said, you know, once the guy stopped shaving, right?
02:25:58.84 --> 02:26:01.20 Then they stopped taking care of the weapons and everything goes downhill.
02:26:01.20 --> 02:26:04.96 So what, to me, one of the things that this applies to, I mean, you're talking about it
02:26:04.96 --> 02:26:08.000 from also from a pure health perspective.
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000 Obviously.
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.88 But it's also psychological factors.
02:26:10.88 --> 02:26:11.88 Yes.
02:26:11.88 --> 02:26:13.88 Yes.
02:26:13.88 --> 02:26:17.40 Number three exercise.
02:26:17.40 --> 02:26:19.88 Set up a daily exercise period.
02:26:19.88 --> 02:26:21.76 Do something.
02:26:21.76 --> 02:26:27.08 And if you are in stocks and chains, you can at least flex a few muscles and do some
02:26:27.08 --> 02:26:28.08 deep breathing.
02:26:28.08 --> 02:26:29.08 Okay.
02:26:29.08 --> 02:26:38.96 There is no more excuses ever, ever for not working out, for not doing something physical.
02:26:38.96 --> 02:26:43.92 Even if you're in stock, AIDS and chains.
02:26:43.92 --> 02:26:49.84 Yeah, not in a recliner with a TV.
02:26:49.84 --> 02:26:52.04 Believeable.
02:26:52.04 --> 02:26:54.48 Do not give up the fight to stay alive.
02:26:54.48 --> 02:26:55.48 This is number four.
02:26:55.48 --> 02:26:57.28 Do not give up this fight to stay alive.
02:26:57.28 --> 02:27:02.32 No matter how sick you are, how serious you wounds or how hopeless the situation is, there's
02:27:02.32 --> 02:27:04.08 always a chance you can make it.
02:27:04.08 --> 02:27:09.36 Take that chance with your deepest courage, fight for it.
02:27:09.36 --> 02:27:12.48 Then again, you'll apply this every day.
02:27:12.48 --> 02:27:14.40 Look at the opportunities you have.
02:27:14.40 --> 02:27:18.20 I mean, the opportunities that a normal person has.
02:27:18.20 --> 02:27:21.04 We don't even take advantage of those opportunities that we have.
02:27:21.04 --> 02:27:22.84 We don't even fight for those.
02:27:22.84 --> 02:27:27.20 Fight for those.
02:27:27.20 --> 02:27:30.68 Number five, establish communications with other prisoners.
02:27:30.68 --> 02:27:35.08 Use your initiative and imagination to make contact with others and then develop a chain
02:27:35.08 --> 02:27:38.72 of command.
02:27:38.72 --> 02:27:40.36 Build relationships with people.
02:27:40.36 --> 02:27:41.36 No.
02:27:41.36 --> 02:27:45.52 Build relationships with people.
02:27:45.52 --> 02:27:49.44 Number six, follow the code of conduct.
02:27:49.44 --> 02:27:53.12 You must know the code before you find yourself in a prison camp.
02:27:53.12 --> 02:27:59.08 Then you should adhere to the articles as strictly as possible.
02:27:59.08 --> 02:28:01.16 That doesn't mean it here perfectly.
02:28:01.16 --> 02:28:03.04 Because no one can adhere perfectly.
02:28:03.04 --> 02:28:05.36 But adhere as close as possible.
02:28:05.36 --> 02:28:07.44 If you waiver, come back to it.
02:28:07.44 --> 02:28:13.96 Don't waiver and think that you've failed and then just cave in and give in.
02:28:13.96 --> 02:28:17.08 That's one of the things again we were talking on the way over here.
02:28:17.08 --> 02:28:21.92 That was one of the changes after the experiences that you all had is what initiated those
02:28:21.92 --> 02:28:26.20 changes in the code of conduct to give it some flexibility.
02:28:26.20 --> 02:28:31.24 So that people could bounce back from and say, oh, you know, yesterday didn't make it.
02:28:31.24 --> 02:28:33.04 Today is a new day.
02:28:33.04 --> 02:28:37.32 I think that attitude is perfect for everyday life.
02:28:37.32 --> 02:28:38.96 You fall off the wagon on something.
02:28:38.96 --> 02:28:39.96 Okay.
02:28:39.96 --> 02:28:41.28 That doesn't get back on it.
02:28:41.28 --> 02:28:47.36 Number seven, keep the faith.
02:28:47.36 --> 02:28:53.16 Faith in your family, your religion and your country may be all that keeps you alive and
02:28:53.16 --> 02:28:54.16 sane.
02:28:54.16 --> 02:28:56.88 Hang in there.
02:28:56.88 --> 02:29:02.28 You are not forgotten.
02:29:02.28 --> 02:29:04.64 That needs no explanation.
02:29:04.64 --> 02:29:12.56 And number eight, maintain a sense of humor.
02:29:12.56 --> 02:29:17.40 This is difficult, but both possible and necessary.
02:29:17.40 --> 02:29:23.28 A bit of humor helps keep away fits of total depression.
02:29:23.28 --> 02:29:28.000 And remember, depression can kill.
02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000 So yes.
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.44 And I'd practice what I've preached by my poor family and close friends.
02:29:34.44 --> 02:29:36.92 Oh, my very crazy six cents a year.
02:29:36.92 --> 02:29:38.52 But I do have one.
02:29:38.52 --> 02:29:41.76 And I did, throughout, and I give a couple examples in the book where it's a very
02:29:41.76 --> 02:29:44.40 dire times, I would come up with a stupidest humor.
02:29:44.40 --> 02:29:47.60 But I'd like to tell you.
02:29:47.60 --> 02:29:49.64 Well, I've talked about that as well.
02:29:49.64 --> 02:29:52.76 And we would be in the worst situations possible.
02:29:52.76 --> 02:29:55.60 And always someone would be laughing about something.
02:29:55.60 --> 02:30:00.60 And that's what, like you said, that's what keeps the spirit going and keeps you on
02:30:00.60 --> 02:30:04.40 the same side of things as to have fun with it.
02:30:04.40 --> 02:30:07.68 Is there anything that any points that I missed?
02:30:07.68 --> 02:30:10.96 I mean, again, I know I missed a lot of points.
02:30:10.96 --> 02:30:15.68 Anything else that you would recommend or you wanted to bring up?
02:30:15.68 --> 02:30:17.48 I don't think you missed anything, Jack.
02:30:17.48 --> 02:30:21.32 You covered the book very thoroughly.
02:30:21.32 --> 02:30:24.32 The title is Through the Valley, My Captivity and Vietnam.
02:30:24.32 --> 02:30:33.20 And I'm saying that because I hope that this book will be of benefit and value to others.
02:30:33.20 --> 02:30:35.24 And that's really what drove me to finish the book.
02:30:35.24 --> 02:30:36.24 I started it.
02:30:36.24 --> 02:30:37.96 And I was wondering why I was writing it.
02:30:37.96 --> 02:30:43.96 But I think when the whole thing is put together, it's a story of hope and the power of hope
02:30:43.96 --> 02:30:49.28 and how anyone can face very adverse conditions, challenges in life.
02:30:49.28 --> 02:30:56.08 Be they guys coming back with PTSD from combat, be it just a single mother somewhere with
02:30:56.08 --> 02:30:58.28 problems, others with difficulties.
02:30:58.28 --> 02:31:03.16 I think in reading this book, you can come out of it with hope.
02:31:03.16 --> 02:31:12.40 And hopefully with motivation to overcome those difficulties and have a full, wonderful and
02:31:12.40 --> 02:31:15.80 beautiful life because it is a beautiful thing.
02:31:15.80 --> 02:31:20.96 If we'll just grab a hold of that beauty and go for it and not dwell on whatever negative
02:31:20.96 --> 02:31:23.40 aspects there might be.
02:31:23.40 --> 02:31:24.44 There's no doubt.
02:31:24.44 --> 02:31:31.96 And even though I did a may have done a thorough job, I read less than 10%, much less than
02:31:31.96 --> 02:31:32.96 10%.
02:31:32.96 --> 02:31:37.76 There's so much more that you went through that you experienced and the other people that
02:31:37.76 --> 02:31:42.88 you talk about who went through what they went through.
02:31:42.88 --> 02:31:44.12 It's a phenomenal book.
02:31:44.12 --> 02:31:47.52 It's a phenomenal book through the Valley, my captivity and Vietnam.
02:31:47.52 --> 02:31:49.76 There'll be a link for it.
02:31:49.76 --> 02:31:50.76 Yes.
02:31:50.76 --> 02:31:55.28 So you can go to the website and get right and get it ordered.
02:31:55.28 --> 02:31:56.28 You guys know the deal.
02:31:56.28 --> 02:31:57.28 Do it quick.
02:31:57.28 --> 02:31:58.28 So you made a copy.
02:31:58.28 --> 02:32:01.96 Yes, I should add one thing because we talked about a lot of the negative stuff in the
02:32:01.96 --> 02:32:02.96 book.
02:32:02.96 --> 02:32:03.96 It does have a happy ending.
02:32:03.96 --> 02:32:09.28 The happy ending at the end of this book is Melanie Ross Reader, my wife.
02:32:09.28 --> 02:32:13.56 And that the love story is in there and how we came together.
02:32:13.56 --> 02:32:19.84 But she and then the two younger kids we talked about Spencer and Vicki, but also Chad and
02:32:19.84 --> 02:32:25.40 Chelsea have brought such a joy to my life and brought this whole journey to a conclusion.
02:32:25.40 --> 02:32:30.44 So there's the power of hope and there's also the power of love that comes out at the end
02:32:30.44 --> 02:32:31.44 of this.
02:32:31.44 --> 02:32:34.64 It's absolutely, it's beautiful.
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:37.04 It's a great book.
02:32:37.04 --> 02:32:45.08 And I can't even begin to express how appreciative that we are for you coming here and sharing
02:32:45.08 --> 02:32:50.48 the story with us, your determination, and your heroism.
02:32:50.48 --> 02:32:56.68 I could literally sit here and listen to you indefinitely.
02:32:56.68 --> 02:32:58.76 And so thank you.
02:32:58.76 --> 02:33:04.08 I know you have worked to attend to and I dragged you out here when you're already working
02:33:04.08 --> 02:33:06.28 hard.
02:33:06.28 --> 02:33:13.28 Thanks to you, thanks to your cousin Ryan Summers who actually contacted us through the
02:33:13.28 --> 02:33:15.56 interwebs and linked us up together.
02:33:15.56 --> 02:33:22.64 So thanks to Ryan for doing that, appreciate it and actually echo speaking of the interwebs.
02:33:22.64 --> 02:33:27.68 If anybody wants to support this podcast, is there any way that they could do that?
02:33:27.68 --> 02:33:28.68 Yes.
02:33:28.68 --> 02:33:29.68 A little bit, actually one question.
02:33:29.68 --> 02:33:31.68 We're going to go back with broken.
02:33:31.68 --> 02:33:32.68 Thank you.
02:33:32.68 --> 02:33:33.68 Lower back.
02:33:33.68 --> 02:33:38.36 Yeah, TL1, T12, L2 all in there.
02:33:38.36 --> 02:33:42.66 I'm few as I was, well we didn't get it all my surgeries after him back, but I'm all
02:33:42.66 --> 02:33:45.72 fused together and wired together in my back.
02:33:45.72 --> 02:33:49.88 I was going to ask what did you eat the whole time, but just rice on the whole time?
02:33:49.88 --> 02:33:52.76 Well, I'll tell you I got to hand over and then I said the bean sprouts was ready.
02:33:52.76 --> 02:33:56.24 What I found is they keep that diet for about three weeks running.
02:33:56.24 --> 02:34:00.88 So I had nothing of a bean sprouts both times away for three weeks, then we get pumpkin soup,
02:34:00.88 --> 02:34:06.20 cabbage soup, Corabi and Corabi is the only thing I don't really care for.
02:34:06.20 --> 02:34:09.48 Since I came to love rice actually, but that was partly psychological because I had to eat
02:34:09.48 --> 02:34:10.48 it.
02:34:10.48 --> 02:34:12.44 So I do truly love rice today.
02:34:12.44 --> 02:34:15.08 That's kind of vegetarian diet.
02:34:15.08 --> 02:34:16.08 More or less.
02:34:16.08 --> 02:34:17.08 Yeah, yeah.
02:34:17.08 --> 02:34:19.08 My cholesterol was very low on the diet.
02:34:19.08 --> 02:34:20.08 Yeah, yeah.
02:34:20.08 --> 02:34:21.08 Yeah, yeah.
02:34:21.08 --> 02:34:22.08 Okay.
02:34:22.08 --> 02:34:25.36 Yes, interwebs.
02:34:25.36 --> 02:34:31.92 So let me talk about on its supplementation real quick.

02:35:04.80 --> 02:35:07.80 Click through the website, this little Amazon shop banner.
02:35:07.80 --> 02:35:11.20 Click through there then to your shopping and then you know that it supports that way.

02:35:15.04 --> 02:35:20.80 I think most people have, but in the event of you not having subscribed already do that
02:35:20.80 --> 02:35:23.68 and leave a review if you're in the mood.
02:35:23.68 --> 02:35:31.12 And we have a YouTube channel if you didn't know that I post some we post some videos.
