When it's time to lift like I could lift a lot, but like every day life on my kind of stiff, you know, like, I got to like get up after all, you know. If you were on Don't, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like, on Don in Paris, Island, which is where I'm reading corporate bootcamp is, or one of them, there's also one here in Tandy, Eagle. And here's some of the things that they did back to the book, Dr. Gundryl and Norman Claycher, know your weapon, know it intimately, know it with almost the insight of its inventor, be able to take it apart blindfolded or in the dark to put it together, be able to recite mechanically a detailed description of the gun's operation, know the part played by every member of the squad from gunner down to the unfortunate who carried the water can or the machine gun boxes as well as their own rifles. I think that's, and of course, someone going to be like, hey, you know, and they'll say an idea, it might not be all that good, but if, or it may not seem like it's all that good. It helps like even like the onset of like osteoporosis, like all this stuff. They'd be like, you know, so it was like the more open and like whatever you were, the cooler it kind of was. And you know how like weights is a good kind of weights is cool because you know how strong you are kind of thing. But if another person says it, kind of unrelated, you know, not the kind of where some guys should say, but do this, you know, make this or create this and then someone just likes it or puts a like on it. When you see someone going through some trouble to be able to recognize like, hey, you know, echoes going through some issues right now. yeah, they did, but like the point is like it was kind of like the cool culture. Perfect example of people saying, you know, people were saying it so like like mad. Because like the more people, you know, they'll hit us on the pun Twitter or just like kind of knowing and knowing what year's talking about or submitting questions. It's just like, if you're shy, you know, or that kind of thing, like some guy didn't have stalls. Any kind of workout where you need, you know, like maximum mobility, but you still want to go with like a shirt on. Yeah, it seems like they can relate, you know, like echoes at level eight right now. And I remember some people were like kind of surprised because they're going to just to the army that just like Dr. Gentle here. And I was like, well, sometimes it seemed like the podcast was like, was me and echo sitting in a room alone. Like when I go on the road now, like I was just out with some firefighters and like we're all, everyone's telling the same jokes. So he's saying, look, you guys that are high-spirited go-getters, and they're going to get after it on the battlefield, and they're going to get after it on the liberty, and sometimes they're going to get rolled up unless they're super lucky, and that doesn't make them bad people. You know, like, when you know the guys on the story. That's not like you're like, let me think of this question that I think people have. Because it's the tournaments, you know, when you're winning around like, oh, and my up in my up, that's like, can be part of the chat. Well, I'll be like, oh, I'm just going to rest because I don't feel like I didn't get nine hours of sleep songs to it tomorrow. No, but I'm saying like, you know, you know, you don't care about my goal. And so when my buddy had this big incident that he did, which, you know, he was drunk and got crazy and, you know, got arrested and all that, all that bad stuff. I wish I would have been doing other things, you know, but if you're in a leadership position and you've got guys like this and you can demo instead of trying to help them, you're not helping them. Yeah, kind of like we'll talk about sometimes where you get a guy, like if you're watching a video As they said, but anyway, so it's like kind of I compare like the post krill oil and the pre-cruel oil situation. Kind of like that the week superficial assumption is that, oh, you're going to choose that kind of that hard thing. The speculative dread, just thinking about, okay, what's the next attack going to be like, are we going to be able to get through it? You're going to be on all of them and you've already seen X number of guys that you had killed and you're going to keep going until you're killed. And I think that forms such a tight bond that these guys had, you know, these guys had respect enough respect and enough mercy on each other to say, look, that goes out an hour and a time right now. I met some young Marine, not a young Marine, but you know, guys probably 25, 27 years old and he came into the gym and you know, some say, I use in the Marine Corps. It's like because you just kind of explain, like kind of the logic behind it. It formed a club or corporation, much as do those other common things upon which men for diverse reasons, play so great of value, like money, like charity. Yeah. nephew, like, actually actual nephew, like, his dad's brother or something. And the officer goes, hey, you guys are young warriors and things like this are going to happen. Because even now, man, people will send me, you know, whether it be funny videos, there's this sodium video that, you know, the guy skipping a piece of sodium across the lake. YouTube's good like that where if you listen to just the, like, an excerpt, we're just a clip two minute three minutes four minutes. You know all those little things that you have, all the little things that make you you, we are going to take them away. And, you know, that the, I think, you know, we kind of did some calculations. And YouTube is good like that where if there's a bunch of them, which, well, I think we're kind of coming up with, or collections kind of growing now. It was the one where the Marines like we would stay on the ship when we pulled an port and it would take like an hour to get off the ship because everyone would be waiting in line.
