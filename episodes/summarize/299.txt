It's the circuit of that thing and it's The benefits are the things that keep that are kind of nice and especially if you don't know If other people are settling down getting married your friends getting real jobs at see more real on paper and those things are I didn't want to be like everybody else that's the thing I always remember my head I didn't want to be like a lot of people I wanted to manage my embassy only thing I had was Everything else in my life since my birth it felt like it was like a sentence like this is who you are you are somebody who You know, you're not you're not going to be in a home where you were really loved you're not You know things like that. I'm just trying to share some of you know share what Some of that was like from me, but um Yeah, I think it was Tyler it's like uh You felt like you weren't part of a plan like nobody planned or if you were it was a plan that was Destined to fail, you know what I'm saying it so then that almost makes you feel like What's going on if my commander and chief here my mother or something Set me up in this plan that doesn't seem like it has Statistically this doesn't seem super smart. so I always felt like if you were laughing you couldn't dislike me at a laugh at the same moment Like at that moment like it was down to that moment like when you were done laughing I didn't know what you thought of me, you know, and it was kind of scary because I think I didn't think much of myself and so the only Way I had to feel about myself from moments a moment was how other people felt about you know if I'm real honest and and then also you're out there you have you're able to establish brief relationships You know one night stands you know a little bit of sex here and there a little bit of touch and jerking off next to someone not even sex Sometimes or even just jerking off by yourself and wishing somebody was there You know, which is really one I mean that was that was probably two out of three Like only one of those sounded like a relationship You know what's out of like perversion and you're the one who just sounded lovely so I don't know worse We're gonna be there just doing what we're doing So we appreciate that if you can't afford that and you still want to be a supporter You can email assistance at jacca owner ground calm that way you can get You can get it to the underground Which is where you want to be we got a YouTube channel too by the way Struc verified by the way For the video version of this podcast you want to see what the feel looks like if you don't know I think a lot of us already know, but if you don't know phone you can see that video podcast is increasingly becoming kind of the way You know to watch listen to the podcast. I mean it was really just like a damn newborn like a strong newborn You know I'm saying one that fucking elbow crawls out You know with a can of freaking go in a car I know I said they kind of baby that beats mom Okay, like this thing was ready to go this thing was ten months in the this thing was I go to make Um, and then COVID hits and then COVID hit so then you have all this down time and I don't know if I always felt like that as a kid I felt like more like every day was a battle, you know where is now I'm like man every there's there's a lot of good stuff out there something maybe tropical you know it was some ocean sounds in the back You know maybe get that Viet and me's got to go by drinking that cranberry on the skateboard You know I would get it kind of you know maybe slightly urban you know maybe somebody playing you know And so when that world gets tough and you don't know anything else man that that struggled that is your Vietnam Yeah, and that's where people end up whether it's you know some girl kissing on you when you're Whatever I'm gonna do well the tough part was other people were walked like the bigger bull with like my brother and his friends The bus would pick them up first and so then it would come and get me and so that's when she would pick me up And it was like my first girlfriend And people will approach or whatever I think sometimes they can like miss represent who you are They're like oh, yeah, maybe like they feel like they know you got a podcast all this stuff Yeah, when I was like what once I got a like 12 or 13 I kind of I was like I mean it was kind of embarrassing you know having such an older time my dad would fall he'd be a sleep at like a vent he would fall asleep at the Carpool when he'd come pick us up he'd fall asleep You know I would like to meet him in you know like He was some people's Like I did reach some reality tell was when I was younger you know for a couple years on TV so So laughter was it really for me that was my biceps, you know It seems like to uh there's an opportunity for someone that's in your position where you have this kind of like insecurity and kind of a little bit of a paranoia against the world To go down the path of like drug and alcohol abuse and we all know where that path ends up if we stay on it The the roots come up through them just like kneecaps just like you know You got a thousand long leg at man buried right there under the sidewalk, you know and some of them's you know So I was always worried about I think what people were thinking of me and I felt like people didn't like me I felt like I think because sometimes I don't know if I was just such an uncomfortable kid sometimes that I Needed laughter But yeah, I should sometimes I don't know what I'm talking about you know, but he's like so open with that and I don't mean Open like he's like making this huge effort to be open you know yeah, my company hard work doesn't necessarily mean you get promoted I'm like that's true everywhere hard work doesn't necessarily like you can't just expect I'm just gonna work hard work hard work hard and that then things are just gonna happen If that if it was I hate to say if it was that easy and a lot more people do it not everyone do hard work He always is trying to show me that people care about me, you know because I think for so long I didn't feel like anybody did you know when I was real real young and I'm not complaining and you know I'm not complaining about it. and he and it felt like you talk about so many very specific like like basically It's essentially like take action, you know, like I Had a comb I remember that he kept in his pocket maybe it was Yeah, a nice one of those small cones man used to keep and they still keep up in cube a lot of time You see a lot of Cuban men still get that small comb on Mm-hmm, and you think that might have been the critical factor for for your mom looking at him thinking damn look at that comb I think in a small town, you know, it's just that something like that can stand out Was your mom from Covington, Louisiana too? Yes, you know, was a single mom and Yeah, and I don't know I you were almost I don't know what you would expect kind of having a child or children with the older man You know what kind of expectations you might have and then you're in a new place where you can have something you know it's like The the moss of life never has a chance to grow on you really you keep out running The moss really and the moss is things that That are real or you know were barnacles anything that you just you just evade things enough And comedy just offered me that I don't even know if I wanted to be a comedian I think I wanted to not have to be somewhere I've learned a lot about people through Podcasts and you know I'm just enamored to none of the people that come out and the sweet the release nice stories that they share you know Uh, um, and then people will share stuff with me that mean something to them sometimes like Some guy came up to me this morning at the cafe and said hey man. and then when they The things they say or they try to like relate to you whatever the like they're just way off a lot of the time I think Not not necessarily my sometimes it can be you know, but the fact that like a random quote and quote random stranger can come up to you and and you know if you got something if you're not if you feel like Freaking depressed or whatever then you're like hey, this is what I feel like right now all But something like hey man, this is freaking hard right now for whatever reason whatever that reason right might be and You know I think when people Just knowing that someone else is kind of like bear with them. I've never seen any of his you know past work When I knew him it was you know, it was just a lot of stories and there was more like the stories by the time I met him and stories, you know They they get barnacles on him over time. Yeah, treating me like I was somebody that didn't It was like some rich do some rich, you know Second hand generation rich or third hand generation rich, you know somebody look I'll say this somebody in their family probably had some cotton on them So I think that's why I needed laughter because it was like oh man if I can get It was the only thing I trusted is that there's no way somebody could be laughing and I can see them laughing and having joy and And hate me at the same time, you know, it was just so that was like That was the only equation that made that to me was undeniable and I think that's I don't know if that's really for everybody in the in the seal teams we used to say like Well, you know if I mean things get bad, you know you just get going a trip to get on that plane Everything's for everything's gone no more problems you're in some new place everything's great now Yeah exactly right, but Theo is like a naturally what seems natural like he's a naturally authentic person it sounds like from what you're saying though He wasn't always like that You know But after a while the stuff on the inside becomes more and more sensitive, you know Where if it even if it's exposed this much it's like well the reaction is a little bit a lot stronger, you know Yeah, and then comedy but comedy kept doing good it was like this thing and when I look back I really think it was something God that just You know God just wanted to keep taking care of me, you know even though I think when I was young you know that those are kind of thoughts when I was a kid like I was just thinking you know Machine gun throwing rocks uh you know taking apart Peep pieces of furniture. That's part of his that's going to be lying No, you partially lying, but it's not really lying if you don't know but he was You know his dad owned like a corner-lick restore or something and he did you know he got a after-increated the Right or like doing the rock Johnson your kids will be like oh here comes the big 80 It gets like I don't think the matters when you are It's gonna be your kids are gonna go through an age period where they're embarrassed by you.
