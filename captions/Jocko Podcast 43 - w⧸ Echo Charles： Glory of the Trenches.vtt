00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.28
This is Jockel Podcast number 43 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:11.28 --> 00:00:17.24
All the lads have gone out to play at being soldiers far away.

3
00:00:17.24 --> 00:00:24.24
They won't be back for many a day and some won't be back any morning.

4
00:00:24.24 --> 00:00:30.92
All the lasses who laughing were when hearts were light and lads were here.

5
00:00:30.92 --> 00:00:34.96
They go sad-eyed wandering hither in there.

6
00:00:34.96 --> 00:00:39.76
They pray and watch for the morning.

7
00:00:39.76 --> 00:00:43.48
Every house has its vacant bed.

8
00:00:43.48 --> 00:00:50.36
Every night when sounds are dead, some woman yearns for the pillowed head of him who marched

9
00:00:50.36 --> 00:00:53.36
out in the morning.

10
00:00:53.36 --> 00:01:01.72
Of all the lads who've gone out to play, there's some or a turn and some who will stay.

11
00:01:01.72 --> 00:01:06.56
There's some will be back most any day.

12
00:01:06.56 --> 00:01:12.96
But some won't wake up in the morning.

13
00:01:12.96 --> 00:01:14.68
Good evening echo.

14
00:01:14.68 --> 00:01:16.68
Good evening.

15
00:01:16.68 --> 00:01:23.24
That poem right there is called the lads away and it's from a book called The

16
00:01:23.24 --> 00:01:26.96
Glory of the Trenches.

17
00:01:26.96 --> 00:01:29.56
That corneams be Dawson.

18
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:39.000
And actually got this book in original copy of this book from a trooper from Jesse.

19
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.60
Trooper up from Canada and he sent me this book and like I said it's the actual first

20
00:01:42.60 --> 00:01:47.12
printing beautiful copy and it has that smell.

21
00:01:47.12 --> 00:01:54.12
The old book must be smell.

22
00:01:54.12 --> 00:01:57.36
It's one of those books where you can actually smell the age and you can smell the lessons

23
00:01:57.36 --> 00:02:03.08
learned and you can smell the wisdom inside of it.

24
00:02:03.08 --> 00:02:04.88
It's a different view.

25
00:02:04.88 --> 00:02:12.12
It's a different feel and I found it to be very fascinating.

26
00:02:12.12 --> 00:02:18.04
The intro to the book is actually written by Dawson's father.

27
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:22.24
So the intro to the book, Dawson is the guy that wrote the book, Cunning's B. Dawson is

28
00:02:22.24 --> 00:02:23.24
the guy that wrote the book.

29
00:02:23.24 --> 00:02:28.96
Well his dad wrote the intro to the book and he kind of kicks it off and here's some

30
00:02:28.96 --> 00:02:30.12
of the highlights of that.

31
00:02:30.12 --> 00:02:36.44
He says I've already stated the conditions under which this book of my sons was produced.

32
00:02:36.44 --> 00:02:42.96
He was wounded in the end of June 1917 in the fierce struggle before lens.

33
00:02:42.96 --> 00:02:48.60
He was at once removed to a base hospital later to a military hospital in London there

34
00:02:48.60 --> 00:02:54.80
was engraved danger of amputation of the right arm, but this was happily avoided.

35
00:02:54.80 --> 00:02:58.12
As soon as he could use his hand he was commingdeared by the Lord High Commissioner of

36
00:02:58.12 --> 00:03:03.64
Canada right and important paper detailing the history of the Canadian forces in France

37
00:03:03.64 --> 00:03:06.84
and flanders.

38
00:03:06.84 --> 00:03:11.64
He goes on to talk about how they came up with the name of the book and they go through

39
00:03:11.64 --> 00:03:17.32
a couple different titles and they settle on this title, the glory of the trenches.

40
00:03:17.32 --> 00:03:23.92
Lastly we decided on the glory of the trenches as the most expressive of his aim.

41
00:03:23.92 --> 00:03:30.04
He felt that a great deal too much had been said about the squalder, filth, discomfort and

42
00:03:30.04 --> 00:03:31.72
suffering of the trenches.

43
00:03:31.72 --> 00:03:34.64
Now clearly that stuff that I've talked about.

44
00:03:34.64 --> 00:03:36.000
And so this should have tell you that's what I'm talking about.

45
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This is a different take on World War I.

46
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.60
Because he's saying look we've heard enough about the squalder that felt this comfort

47
00:03:42.60 --> 00:03:45.80
I'm going to talk about the glory of the trenches.

48
00:03:45.80 --> 00:03:51.88
He pointed out that a very popular war book which we were reading had six paragraphs and

49
00:03:51.88 --> 00:03:57.44
the first 60 pages which described an unpleasant detail, the verminous condition of the men.

50
00:03:57.44 --> 00:04:02.92
Because if this were the chief thing to be remarked concerning them, he held that it was

51
00:04:02.92 --> 00:04:09.40
a mistake for a writer to lay too much on the too much stress on the horrors of war.

52
00:04:09.40 --> 00:04:12.76
The effect was bad physiologically.

53
00:04:12.76 --> 00:04:15.08
It frightened the parents of soldiers.

54
00:04:15.08 --> 00:04:20.72
It was equally bad for the enlisted man himself for it created a false impression in his mind.

55
00:04:20.72 --> 00:04:25.68
We all knew that war was horrible, but as a rule the soldier thought little of his

56
00:04:25.68 --> 00:04:29.36
future in this lot.

57
00:04:29.36 --> 00:04:33.24
The real soldier thoughts were concerned with other things.

58
00:04:33.24 --> 00:04:37.28
He was engaged in spiritual acts and this is what I'm talking about.

59
00:04:37.28 --> 00:04:40.20
This is a different cut.

60
00:04:40.20 --> 00:04:47.44
He was accomplishing spiritual purposes as truly as the marker of faith and religion.

61
00:04:47.44 --> 00:04:54.32
He was moved by spiritual impulses, the evocation of duty, the loyal dependence of

62
00:04:54.32 --> 00:05:01.24
the comradeship, the spirit of sacrifice, the complete surrender of the body to the will of

63
00:05:01.24 --> 00:05:03.32
the soul.

64
00:05:03.32 --> 00:05:06.76
This was the side of war which men needed most to recognize.

65
00:05:06.76 --> 00:05:11.76
They needed it not only because it was the true side, but because nothing else could

66
00:05:11.76 --> 00:05:16.72
Kindle and sustain the enduring flame of heroism in men's hearts.

67
00:05:16.72 --> 00:05:20.88
So he's looking at this, you know, it's called the glory of the trenches.

68
00:05:20.88 --> 00:05:26.56
This, what happens in the trenches is like a religion, it's like a spiritual thing.

69
00:05:26.56 --> 00:05:30.84
Which another thing that drew me to this is because, you know, I talk all the time about

70
00:05:30.84 --> 00:05:33.72
how there's the most beautiful things in war.

71
00:05:33.72 --> 00:05:36.84
I mean, there's the most horrible things, but there's also these beautiful things.

72
00:05:36.84 --> 00:05:42.48
And so I can see he's very focused on what those things are.

73
00:05:42.48 --> 00:05:49.04
While some aired in exhibiting nothing but the brutality of war, others aired by sentimentizing

74
00:05:49.04 --> 00:05:50.52
war.

75
00:05:50.52 --> 00:05:55.52
He admitted that it was perfectly possible to paint a portrait of a soldier with an aura

76
00:05:55.52 --> 00:06:00.60
of a saint, but it would not be a representative portrait.

77
00:06:00.60 --> 00:06:06.36
It would be eclectic, the result of the selection and the elimination.

78
00:06:06.36 --> 00:06:11.24
So he's saying like on the one hand, you get these books that paint this crazy brutal side

79
00:06:11.24 --> 00:06:15.32
of war, the other side you get them painting soldiers as saints.

80
00:06:15.32 --> 00:06:18.000
And neither want to show which I will totally agree with.

81
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.08
You know, we do have a definite tendency to do that in literature or people that write

82
00:06:23.08 --> 00:06:26.52
about war, they want to write about, you know, they make everyone look like the best guy ever.

83
00:06:26.52 --> 00:06:28.16
None of us are.

84
00:06:28.16 --> 00:06:30.24
None of us are.

85
00:06:30.24 --> 00:06:33.16
We all have faults.

86
00:06:33.16 --> 00:06:38.76
Back to the book, the ordinary soldier is an intensely human creature with an endearing

87
00:06:38.76 --> 00:06:41.52
blend of faults and virtues.

88
00:06:41.52 --> 00:06:47.60
The romantic method of portraying him not only misrepresented him, but its result is far

89
00:06:47.60 --> 00:06:54.72
less impressive than a portrait painted in the firm lines of reality.

90
00:06:54.72 --> 00:06:59.72
So they do all this to make the guy look like a saint, but what's real is actually more

91
00:06:59.72 --> 00:07:00.96
amazing.

92
00:07:00.96 --> 00:07:07.16
There's an austere grandeur in the reality of what he is and does which needs no fine

93
00:07:07.16 --> 00:07:10.60
gilding from the sentimentalist.

94
00:07:10.60 --> 00:07:17.24
To depict him as Sir Gala had in Holy Armor is a serious offense as to exhibit him

95
00:07:17.24 --> 00:07:24.76
as a caliban, which is from Shakespeare, from the temp to see like the ultimate bad guy

96
00:07:24.76 --> 00:07:31.32
in the Shakespeare's play the temp, the tempest, because the total beast.

97
00:07:31.32 --> 00:07:37.52
So you can't portray the person as Gala had, you can't, you can't, you know, again portraying

98
00:07:37.52 --> 00:07:40.04
him as a saint.

99
00:07:40.04 --> 00:07:45.48
Each method fails of truth and all that the soldier needs to be known about him that men

100
00:07:45.48 --> 00:07:49.96
should honor him is the truth.

101
00:07:49.96 --> 00:07:58.84
War, a hot new air, which men breathed, produced new energies and forms of thought.

102
00:07:58.84 --> 00:08:03.64
Men were rediscovering themselves, their own forgotten abilities, the latent abilities

103
00:08:03.64 --> 00:08:06.60
in all men.

104
00:08:06.60 --> 00:08:12.40
Bound together in the daily obedience of self-surrender, urged by conditions of their

105
00:08:12.40 --> 00:08:21.20
task to regard duty as inexorable, confronted by the pitilist destruction of the body.

106
00:08:21.20 --> 00:08:26.88
They were forced into recognition of the spiritual values of life.

107
00:08:26.88 --> 00:08:30.44
So faced with what they were facing in World War I and we've talked about that over and

108
00:08:30.44 --> 00:08:34.08
over again, you're facing death.

109
00:08:34.08 --> 00:08:41.92
And these guys, these soldiers are forced to look at their spiritual self.

110
00:08:41.92 --> 00:08:47.40
The common conventional use of the term, these men were not religious.

111
00:08:47.40 --> 00:08:52.04
There was much in their speech and in their conduct, which would outrage the standards

112
00:08:52.04 --> 00:08:54.24
of narrow piousism.

113
00:08:54.24 --> 00:08:57.48
So hey, these guys are not good at issues.

114
00:08:57.48 --> 00:09:02.84
Traditional creeds and forms of faith had scant authority for them, but they had made their

115
00:09:02.84 --> 00:09:08.08
own a sure faith then lives in creeds.

116
00:09:08.08 --> 00:09:19.20
So what they discover on the battlefield is even stronger than what the churches say.

117
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:24.56
It was expressed not in words, but acts.

118
00:09:24.56 --> 00:09:35.36
They had freed their souls from the tyrannies of time and the fear of death.

119
00:09:35.36 --> 00:09:46.92
They had accomplished indeed that very emancipation of the soul, which is the essential doctrine

120
00:09:46.92 --> 00:09:54.88
of all religions, which all religions urge on men, but which few men really achieve.

121
00:09:54.88 --> 00:10:01.24
However, earnestly they profess forms of pious faith.

122
00:10:01.24 --> 00:10:02.24
That's pretty amazing.

123
00:10:02.24 --> 00:10:05.20
That's pretty amazing viewpoint.

124
00:10:05.20 --> 00:10:13.36
What you find out on the battlefield is spiritually stronger than what you find in the

125
00:10:13.36 --> 00:10:18.32
church.

126
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:24.16
Back to the book, this was the true glory of the trenches.

127
00:10:24.16 --> 00:10:30.18
They were the cavalaries of a new redemption being wrought out from men by soiled unconscious

128
00:10:30.18 --> 00:10:31.18
Christ.

129
00:10:31.18 --> 00:10:32.70
That's what the soldiers were.

130
00:10:32.70 --> 00:10:36.50
Soiled, dirty, unconscious means they don't even know it.

131
00:10:36.50 --> 00:10:39.62
Christ's.

132
00:10:39.62 --> 00:10:46.14
And as from that ancient cavalry with its agony of shame, torture and dereliction, their

133
00:10:46.14 --> 00:10:52.34
flowed a flood of light, which made a new dawn for the world.

134
00:10:52.34 --> 00:10:59.86
So from these obscure crucifixions, there would come to men a new revelation of the splendor

135
00:10:59.86 --> 00:11:02.66
of the human soul.

136
00:11:02.66 --> 00:11:10.62
The true divinity that dwells in man, the God made manifest in the flesh by acts of valor,

137
00:11:10.62 --> 00:11:19.94
heroism, and self-sacrifice, which transcend the instincts and promptings of the flesh.

138
00:11:19.94 --> 00:11:30.10
Bear witness to the indestructible life of the Spirit.

139
00:11:30.10 --> 00:11:31.10
That's heavy.

140
00:11:31.10 --> 00:11:41.82
That's just, like I said, this viewpoint is I totally understand where it's coming from.

141
00:11:41.82 --> 00:11:46.38
And it expresses a lot of the things that I think I haven't thought about it to this degree,

142
00:11:46.38 --> 00:11:47.38
though.

143
00:11:47.38 --> 00:11:55.54
So calling the death of soldiers on the battlefield, true to fictions.

144
00:11:55.54 --> 00:12:01.26
And that God is made manifest in the flesh that these guys when they make these sacrifices,

145
00:12:01.26 --> 00:12:04.42
it's like a glimpse of God.

146
00:12:04.42 --> 00:12:09.82
These acts of valor and heroism, and it's just very powerful.

147
00:12:09.82 --> 00:12:14.78
Now that's wrapped up, you know, the intro's longer than that, obviously.

148
00:12:14.78 --> 00:12:18.46
But now we're going to go to the book itself, which again is written by this soldier,

149
00:12:18.46 --> 00:12:19.46
Dawson.

150
00:12:19.46 --> 00:12:21.66
And it actually starts with his training.

151
00:12:21.66 --> 00:12:28.62
And he was from England, and he lived in Canada.

152
00:12:28.62 --> 00:12:35.38
He ends up joining the military, because you know, Canada was supporting and helping Britain

153
00:12:35.38 --> 00:12:36.94
and the war.

154
00:12:36.94 --> 00:12:38.10
And he actually traveled to New York.

155
00:12:38.10 --> 00:12:40.02
He lived all over the place.

156
00:12:40.02 --> 00:12:45.02
And now he's going to boot camp.

157
00:12:45.02 --> 00:12:49.26
When I had been medically examined, past his fit had dawned a uniform and commenced

158
00:12:49.26 --> 00:12:55.42
to my training, I learned what the enduring of hardship was.

159
00:12:55.42 --> 00:13:01.30
No experience on active service has equal the humiliation and severity of those first months

160
00:13:01.30 --> 00:13:02.86
of soldiering.

161
00:13:02.86 --> 00:13:08.58
We were sneered at clean, stables, groomed horses, road stripped saddles, stripped saddle

162
00:13:08.58 --> 00:13:13.70
for 12 miles at the trot, attended lectures, studied till past midnight, and were up

163
00:13:13.70 --> 00:13:17.02
on the first parade at 6 o'clock.

164
00:13:17.02 --> 00:13:22.58
No previous civilian efficiency or prominent stood us in any stead.

165
00:13:22.58 --> 00:13:25.22
We started robbed of all importance.

166
00:13:25.22 --> 00:13:26.78
I love that.

167
00:13:26.78 --> 00:13:27.78
We started robbed of all three.

168
00:13:27.78 --> 00:13:29.50
So you know that thing, you have that to do?

169
00:13:29.50 --> 00:13:30.50
Yeah, it's gone.

170
00:13:30.50 --> 00:13:32.46
Just get rid of that.

171
00:13:32.46 --> 00:13:37.38
And only gained a new importance by our power to hang on and develop a new efficiency as

172
00:13:37.38 --> 00:13:39.10
soldiers.

173
00:13:39.10 --> 00:13:42.46
You've heard me say that before, like when I joined the military, that's one of my favorite

174
00:13:42.46 --> 00:13:43.46
things about us.

175
00:13:43.46 --> 00:13:44.46
I was like a blank slate.

176
00:13:44.46 --> 00:13:48.46
Like everything you did in your past, all the stuff you've been through, little trouble

177
00:13:48.46 --> 00:13:50.30
things you've done, it's all gone.

178
00:13:50.30 --> 00:13:55.38
What matters now is what you do here.

179
00:13:55.38 --> 00:14:02.26
When men went sick, they were labeled scrim shankers and struck off the course.

180
00:14:02.26 --> 00:14:03.70
It was an offense.

181
00:14:03.70 --> 00:14:09.38
It was an offense to let your body interfere with your duty.

182
00:14:09.38 --> 00:14:12.26
If it tried to, you must ignore it.

183
00:14:12.26 --> 00:14:17.50
If a man caught cold in Kingston, what would he not catch in the trenches?

184
00:14:17.50 --> 00:14:21.46
Very many went down under physical, under the physical ordeal.

185
00:14:21.46 --> 00:14:24.82
Of the class that started, I don't think more than the third past.

186
00:14:24.82 --> 00:14:31.18
The lukewarm soldier and the pink tea hero who simply wanted to swank a uniform were eventually

187
00:14:31.18 --> 00:14:33.34
choked off.

188
00:14:33.34 --> 00:14:38.06
Who's a test of pluck, even more than of strength or intelligence.

189
00:14:38.06 --> 00:14:44.14
The same test that a man would be subjected to all the time at the front.

190
00:14:44.14 --> 00:14:50.30
In a word, it started out the fellows who had guts.

191
00:14:50.30 --> 00:14:54.78
guts isn't a particularly polite word, but I have come increasingly to appreciate

192
00:14:54.78 --> 00:14:57.86
its splendid significance.

193
00:14:57.86 --> 00:15:04.62
The possessor of this much coveted quality is the kind of idiot who, when his legs are

194
00:15:04.62 --> 00:15:09.82
smitten, will fight upon his stumps.

195
00:15:09.82 --> 00:15:14.82
And actually, when I read this, I was like, man, there's some archaic term of idiot

196
00:15:14.82 --> 00:15:17.18
why is he using that word and there was none.

197
00:15:17.18 --> 00:15:22.18
He means, that's what he means is a guy, and we say this in the sea of training, like

198
00:15:22.18 --> 00:15:24.22
if you're going to be stupid, you've got to be tough.

199
00:15:24.22 --> 00:15:29.58
And that's kind of what he's saying, like these guys will go and they will not stop.

200
00:15:29.58 --> 00:15:32.46
And that's what guts is.

201
00:15:32.46 --> 00:15:36.14
The Tommy's in that displaying word for the British soldiers, whom we were going to

202
00:15:36.14 --> 00:15:40.10
command, would be like that.

203
00:15:40.10 --> 00:15:43.58
If we weren't like it, we wouldn't be any good as officers.

204
00:15:43.58 --> 00:15:49.98
This artillery school had a violent way of sifting out a man's moral worth.

205
00:15:49.98 --> 00:15:54.06
You hadn't much concede left by the end of it.

206
00:15:54.06 --> 00:16:00.22
So I can only imagine, we have a very politically correct military system now and it's

207
00:16:00.22 --> 00:16:04.58
getting, I can't imagine what these soldiers went through.

208
00:16:04.58 --> 00:16:09.82
I mean, just unleashing these veterans on them coming out and trying to get them ready

209
00:16:09.82 --> 00:16:11.62
for war, I bet it was brutal.

210
00:16:11.62 --> 00:16:12.90
And it sounds like it was brutal.

211
00:16:12.90 --> 00:16:17.30
And it sounds like it did a very effective job of getting rid of the weak, of making your

212
00:16:17.30 --> 00:16:25.46
ego completely go away, getting rid of any form of concede that you had.

213
00:16:25.46 --> 00:16:30.66
Now he continues on the book, but I'm going to move a little bit forward here to where

214
00:16:30.66 --> 00:16:32.26
he's moving towards the front.

215
00:16:32.26 --> 00:16:33.90
And we'll go back to the book.

216
00:16:33.90 --> 00:16:38.18
After trudging about six miles, we arrived at the camp and found that it was out of

217
00:16:38.18 --> 00:16:42.46
food and that all the tents were occupied.

218
00:16:42.46 --> 00:16:46.62
We stretched out our sleeping bags on the ground and went to bed's supper list.

219
00:16:46.62 --> 00:16:48.78
We had no food all day.

220
00:16:48.78 --> 00:16:53.38
Next morning we were told that we ought to jump on an ammunition lorry if we wanted to go

221
00:16:53.38 --> 00:16:55.14
any further on our journey.

222
00:16:55.14 --> 00:16:58.94
Nobody seemed to want us particularly and no one could give us the least information

223
00:16:58.94 --> 00:17:00.78
as to where our division was.

224
00:17:00.78 --> 00:17:06.62
It was another lesson if that were needed of our total unimportance.

225
00:17:06.62 --> 00:17:09.10
So these guys are looking to find whether or not we're supposed to report to say, go

226
00:17:09.10 --> 00:17:10.10
fight in the war.

227
00:17:10.10 --> 00:17:13.02
And people are like, I don't know, no time for you.

228
00:17:13.02 --> 00:17:15.06
Go figure it out.

229
00:17:15.06 --> 00:17:19.78
While we were raiding on the roadside in Australian brigade of artillery passed by,

230
00:17:19.78 --> 00:17:22.58
the men's faces were dreary with fatigue.

231
00:17:22.58 --> 00:17:27.06
The gunners were dismounted and marched as in a trance.

232
00:17:27.06 --> 00:17:29.94
The harness was muddy.

233
00:17:29.94 --> 00:17:34.38
The steel rusty, the horses lean and discouraged.

234
00:17:34.38 --> 00:17:37.50
We understood that they were pulling out from an offensive in which they had received

235
00:17:37.50 --> 00:17:39.70
a bad cutting up.

236
00:17:39.70 --> 00:17:44.46
To my overstrain imagination it seemed that the men had the vision of death in their

237
00:17:44.46 --> 00:17:46.86
eyes.

238
00:17:46.86 --> 00:17:52.14
Towards the evening, the thunder of the guns had swelled into an ominous roar.

239
00:17:52.14 --> 00:17:55.98
We passed through villages disfigured by shell fire.

240
00:17:55.98 --> 00:17:59.70
Civilians became more rare and more aged.

241
00:17:59.70 --> 00:18:02.50
Cattle disappeared utterly from the landscape.

242
00:18:02.50 --> 00:18:08.62
Fields were furrowed with abandoned trances in front of which hung in tanglements of wire.

243
00:18:08.62 --> 00:18:12.82
Mounted orderly splashed along selling roads at an impatient trot.

244
00:18:12.82 --> 00:18:17.30
Here and there we came across improvised beer vacts of infantry.

245
00:18:17.30 --> 00:18:22.86
Far away against the horizon towards which we traveled, hunt flares and rockets were going

246
00:18:22.86 --> 00:18:23.86
up.

247
00:18:23.86 --> 00:18:28.10
Hopeless stoicism, unordered of a desolation.

248
00:18:28.10 --> 00:18:32.66
That was my first impression.

249
00:18:32.66 --> 00:18:35.66
The landscape was getting increasingly muddy.

250
00:18:35.66 --> 00:18:37.94
It became a sea of mud.

251
00:18:37.94 --> 00:18:42.58
Dispatch riders on motorbikes traveled whereally their feet dragging to save themselves from

252
00:18:42.58 --> 00:18:43.58
falling.

253
00:18:43.58 --> 00:18:45.94
Everything was splashed with filth and corruption.

254
00:18:45.94 --> 00:18:50.62
One marveled at the cleanliness of the sky.

255
00:18:50.62 --> 00:18:56.26
Trees were blasted and seemed to be sinking out of sight in this war created slew of

256
00:18:56.26 --> 00:18:58.14
despondency.

257
00:18:58.14 --> 00:19:02.54
We came to a brow of a hill in the valley with something that I recognized.

258
00:19:02.54 --> 00:19:07.42
The last time I had seen it was an etching in a shop window in Newark, New Jersey.

259
00:19:07.42 --> 00:19:13.22
It was a town from the midst of who's battered ruins a splintered tower to sort against

260
00:19:13.22 --> 00:19:15.10
the sky.

261
00:19:15.10 --> 00:19:21.66
Leaning far out from the tower so that it seemed she must drop was a statue of the virgin

262
00:19:21.66 --> 00:19:24.34
with the Christ in her arms.

263
00:19:24.34 --> 00:19:29.94
It was a superstition with the French and I remembered that so long as she did not fall,

264
00:19:29.94 --> 00:19:32.94
things would go well with the allies.

265
00:19:32.94 --> 00:19:40.38
As we watched a shell screamed over the gaping roofs and a call of smoke going up.

266
00:19:40.38 --> 00:19:44.46
As we entered the streets, Tommy's more polluted than miners crept out from the skeletons

267
00:19:44.46 --> 00:19:45.70
of houses.

268
00:19:45.70 --> 00:19:50.70
They lent listlessly against sagging doorways to watch us pass.

269
00:19:50.70 --> 00:19:55.94
If we asked for information as to where our division was, they shook their heads stupidly

270
00:19:55.94 --> 00:20:00.22
to indifferent with weariness to reply.

271
00:20:00.22 --> 00:20:09.62
For the next three nights we slept by our wits and got our food by foraging.

272
00:20:09.62 --> 00:20:15.98
So we know, I mean we know this is a world war one, we know it's an absolute nightmare.

273
00:20:15.98 --> 00:20:17.98
It's an absolute nightmare.

274
00:20:17.98 --> 00:20:21.98
And you know what was surprising me, you know this guy's an officer and he has no idea

275
00:20:21.98 --> 00:20:22.98
what he's doing.

276
00:20:22.98 --> 00:20:28.50
He's just walking around and people are so dispondent from the war that they just

277
00:20:28.50 --> 00:20:34.58
don't even care.

278
00:20:34.58 --> 00:20:38.42
Back to the book, there was a headquarters nearby who's battalion was in the line.

279
00:20:38.42 --> 00:20:43.66
I struck up liaison with its officers and at times went into the crowded tent, which was

280
00:20:43.66 --> 00:20:45.26
their mess to get warm.

281
00:20:45.26 --> 00:20:50.50
Runners would come there at all hours of day and night bringing messages from the front.

282
00:20:50.50 --> 00:20:56.54
They were usually well spent, sometimes they gasped, but they had, but they all had the

283
00:20:56.54 --> 00:21:00.22
invincible determination to carry on.

284
00:21:00.22 --> 00:21:04.22
After they delivered their message, they would lie down in the mud and go to sleep like

285
00:21:04.22 --> 00:21:05.86
dogs.

286
00:21:05.86 --> 00:21:10.02
The moment the reply was ready, they would lurch to their feet throwing off their weiriness

287
00:21:10.02 --> 00:21:16.14
as if it were a thing to be conquered and despised.

288
00:21:16.14 --> 00:21:18.42
Go ahead and read that one again.

289
00:21:18.42 --> 00:21:22.54
So these guys are dog tired, they'd lay down in the mud, someone is preparing a reply

290
00:21:22.54 --> 00:21:27.62
for these messages and then the moment the reply was ready, they would lurch to their

291
00:21:27.62 --> 00:21:34.22
feet throwing off their weiriness as though it were a thing to be conquered and despised.

292
00:21:34.22 --> 00:21:41.06
I appreciate now as never before, I appreciate it now as never before the lesson of guts

293
00:21:41.06 --> 00:21:46.78
that I have been taught at Kingston.

294
00:21:46.78 --> 00:21:52.18
The other side of the town, the ravages of the war were far more marked.

295
00:21:52.18 --> 00:21:57.02
All the way along the roadside were clumps of little crosses, French, English, German,

296
00:21:57.02 --> 00:22:01.50
planted above their hurried graves of brave fellows who had fallen.

297
00:22:01.50 --> 00:22:09.82
Ambulances were picking their way weirly, turning with the last night's toll of wounded.

298
00:22:09.82 --> 00:22:16.06
We saw newly dead men and horses pulled to one sign who had been caught in the darkness

299
00:22:16.06 --> 00:22:22.62
by the enemies harassing fire, in places, in places the country had holes the size of

300
00:22:22.62 --> 00:22:29.46
quarries, where mines had exploded and shells from large caliber guns had detonated.

301
00:22:29.46 --> 00:22:35.26
Bedlam was raging up front, shells went screaming over us, seeking out victims in the

302
00:22:35.26 --> 00:22:37.38
back country.

303
00:22:37.38 --> 00:22:41.66
To have been there by oneself would have been most disturbing but the men about me seemed

304
00:22:41.66 --> 00:22:46.14
to regard it as perfectly ordinary and normal.

305
00:22:46.14 --> 00:22:54.46
I steadied myself by their example.

306
00:22:54.46 --> 00:22:58.94
It's interesting because we're talking about this and it sounds like hell and they're

307
00:22:58.94 --> 00:23:00.10
not even in the front yet.

308
00:23:00.10 --> 00:23:01.26
They're not on the front lines.

309
00:23:01.26 --> 00:23:08.18
This is behind.

310
00:23:08.18 --> 00:23:10.10
That's something else we were talking about today.

311
00:23:10.10 --> 00:23:14.86
You can see these guys, whatever pain and suffering they're feeling, they're not showing

312
00:23:14.86 --> 00:23:15.86
it.

313
00:23:15.86 --> 00:23:18.94
And he knows he can't show it.

314
00:23:18.94 --> 00:23:25.22
And that kind of bolsters them all and makes them all stronger.

315
00:23:25.22 --> 00:23:32.98
Back to the book about seven o'clock as we were resting the evening hate commenced.

316
00:23:32.98 --> 00:23:40.02
In those days the evening hate was a regular habit with the hunt.

317
00:23:40.02 --> 00:23:44.02
The new our country better than we did for he had retired from it.

318
00:23:44.02 --> 00:23:50.26
Every evening he used to search out all communication trenches and likely battery positions

319
00:23:50.26 --> 00:23:53.46
with any quantity of shells.

320
00:23:53.46 --> 00:23:57.74
So seven o'clock at night the Germans would just they knew all the positions because they

321
00:23:57.74 --> 00:24:03.78
had surrendered them so then they would just start dropping bombs, dropping artillery on

322
00:24:03.78 --> 00:24:08.74
the known positions that they knew they knew of the trenches where they built them.

323
00:24:08.74 --> 00:24:13.98
His idea was to rob us of our morale.

324
00:24:13.98 --> 00:24:19.42
I wish he might have seen how abysmal he failed to do it.

325
00:24:19.42 --> 00:24:24.50
Down our narrow valley like a flight of arrows the shells screamed in whistles.

326
00:24:24.50 --> 00:24:29.62
Where they struck the ground look like resurrection day with the dead elbowing their way

327
00:24:29.62 --> 00:24:36.02
into daylight and forcing back the earth from their eyes.

328
00:24:36.02 --> 00:24:42.34
There were actually many dead men just beneath the surface and as the ground was plowed up

329
00:24:42.34 --> 00:24:50.38
the smell of corruption became distinctly unpleasant.

330
00:24:50.38 --> 00:24:55.74
So these guys are buried they're buried in whatever four or five feet of dirt and these

331
00:24:55.74 --> 00:25:01.78
shells come in and dig them up.

332
00:25:01.78 --> 00:25:05.50
Only the shells began to go dud.

333
00:25:05.50 --> 00:25:08.78
So imagine this you're hearing these big explosion and then some shells hit and there's

334
00:25:08.78 --> 00:25:10.42
no explosion.

335
00:25:10.42 --> 00:25:11.94
You know what that means?

336
00:25:11.94 --> 00:25:15.22
It means it's gas.

337
00:25:15.22 --> 00:25:21.02
We realized that these were gas shells a thin, blueish vapor spread throughout the valley

338
00:25:21.02 --> 00:25:23.70
and breathing became oppressive.

339
00:25:23.70 --> 00:25:28.66
Then like stallions kicking in the stalls the heavy guns on the ridge above us opened

340
00:25:28.66 --> 00:25:29.66
up.

341
00:25:29.66 --> 00:25:31.82
Now the friendly guns start to open up.

342
00:25:31.82 --> 00:25:34.74
It was fine to hear them stamping their defiance.

343
00:25:34.74 --> 00:25:39.50
They made one want to get grips with his aggressors and the brief silence is one could

344
00:25:39.50 --> 00:25:40.94
hear our chaps laughing.

345
00:25:40.94 --> 00:25:45.10
So I want you to imagine this is awesome.

346
00:25:45.10 --> 00:25:48.78
You're getting chilled, you're getting crushed.

347
00:25:48.78 --> 00:25:52.06
There's dead bodies coming up from the soil.

348
00:25:52.06 --> 00:25:55.42
There's gas in the air.

349
00:25:55.42 --> 00:26:02.46
And here we go, in the brief silences, one could hear our chaps laughing.

350
00:26:02.46 --> 00:26:05.38
The danger seemed to fill them with a wild excitement.

351
00:26:05.38 --> 00:26:11.34
Every time a shell came near them and missed, they would taunt the unseen huns for

352
00:26:11.34 --> 00:26:18.86
their purport gunnery, giving what they considered necessary corrections.

353
00:26:18.86 --> 00:26:21.54
Five minutes more left old cock.

354
00:26:21.54 --> 00:26:24.10
If you'd only drop 50, you'd get us.

355
00:26:24.10 --> 00:26:28.02
There he's giving corrections to the guns.

356
00:26:28.02 --> 00:26:35.42
These men didn't know what fear was or if they did, they kept it to themselves.

357
00:26:35.42 --> 00:26:39.22
And these were the chaps whom I was to order.

358
00:26:39.22 --> 00:26:41.98
So we haven't heard too much about that.

359
00:26:41.98 --> 00:26:44.50
And Tony and Dave talked about it.

360
00:26:44.50 --> 00:26:50.54
Being a shot at and being really close calls situations and like everyone's laughing

361
00:26:50.54 --> 00:26:52.62
and it does happen.

362
00:26:52.62 --> 00:26:57.86
Hold war one, don't hear much about it, but here you go.

363
00:26:57.86 --> 00:26:58.86
Unbelievable.

364
00:26:58.86 --> 00:27:02.98
That's part of the way that military, that you do, not just military, but any bad situation.

365
00:27:02.98 --> 00:27:06.02
You know, a little humor goes a long way.

366
00:27:06.02 --> 00:27:10.94
A little humor goes a long way.

367
00:27:10.94 --> 00:27:11.94
Back to the book.

368
00:27:11.94 --> 00:27:12.94
We entered a trench.

369
00:27:12.94 --> 00:27:16.82
And this is, by the way, this is, I'm obviously not reading the entire book.

370
00:27:16.82 --> 00:27:22.14
I'm going to some highlights, so there's a little bit of a skip, you know, time here

371
00:27:22.14 --> 00:27:25.50
as they move towards the front.

372
00:27:25.50 --> 00:27:26.50
Back to the book.

373
00:27:26.50 --> 00:27:28.34
We entered a trench.

374
00:27:28.34 --> 00:27:33.78
Holds were scooped out in the side of it, just large enough to shelter a man crouching.

375
00:27:33.78 --> 00:27:40.58
Each hole contained a sleeping soldier who looked as dead as the occupant of a catacom.

376
00:27:40.58 --> 00:27:45.98
Some of the holes had been blown in, all you saw of the late occupant was a protruding

377
00:27:45.98 --> 00:27:48.66
arm or leg.

378
00:27:48.66 --> 00:27:53.50
That best there was a horrid similarity between the dead and the living.

379
00:27:53.50 --> 00:27:57.90
It seemed that the walls of the trenches had been built out of corpses.

380
00:27:57.90 --> 00:28:06.42
For one, recognize the uniforms of French and the Huns.

381
00:28:06.42 --> 00:28:10.62
So you're in this trench, but you're protected somewhat, but you got to dig another hole

382
00:28:10.62 --> 00:28:13.66
into the wall of the trench.

383
00:28:13.66 --> 00:28:18.74
And some of those guys get buried and killed and the body's are just there.

384
00:28:18.74 --> 00:28:21.94
Really, I mean, talk about hell.

385
00:28:21.94 --> 00:28:22.74
Hell.

386
00:28:22.74 --> 00:28:27.22
Back to the book.

387
00:28:27.22 --> 00:28:33.62
The enemy's shelling was growing more intense as was always the way on the zone, so we're

388
00:28:33.62 --> 00:28:35.90
there at the zone, the battle was on.

389
00:28:35.90 --> 00:28:39.18
When we were bringing in our, when we were bringing out our wounded.

390
00:28:39.18 --> 00:28:43.50
The good many of our trenches were directly on filet and if you don't know what that is,

391
00:28:43.50 --> 00:28:49.90
on filet is like, if you can imagine a line of people and you are shooting down the line

392
00:28:49.90 --> 00:28:55.26
of people and how much more exposed you are in that situation.

393
00:28:55.26 --> 00:29:00.78
So picture if I told you to shoot some of these 10 cans and I lined them up in a straight line,

394
00:29:00.78 --> 00:29:04.22
perpendicular to you, you'd have to aim at each individual one and you might hit it,

395
00:29:04.22 --> 00:29:05.22
you might not.

396
00:29:05.22 --> 00:29:09.26
If we put them all in a big line where they're, where they're parallel to you or they're,

397
00:29:09.26 --> 00:29:13.86
they go down the same gun target line that you have, you can, if you hit one, you might

398
00:29:13.86 --> 00:29:16.90
hit two, you might hit three, you might hit all of them with one shot.

399
00:29:16.90 --> 00:29:19.70
And so this is a bad situation to be in.

400
00:29:19.70 --> 00:29:23.46
You never want to have the enemy, so they're basically on your flank and you're lined

401
00:29:23.46 --> 00:29:24.86
up for them to shoot at you.

402
00:29:24.86 --> 00:29:27.38
It's a nightmare.

403
00:29:27.38 --> 00:29:29.30
Shell's burst just behind the parapet.

404
00:29:29.30 --> 00:29:30.82
When they didn't burst on it.

405
00:29:30.82 --> 00:29:38.98
It was about this point in my breaking in that I received a blow to the head and thank God

406
00:29:38.98 --> 00:29:43.46
for the man who invented the steel helmet so he's getting hit with some shrapnel.

407
00:29:43.46 --> 00:29:47.78
Night came down and we found that our carriage had no lights.

408
00:29:47.78 --> 00:29:52.26
It must have been nearing dawn when I was away and again I skipped a little bit but here

409
00:29:52.26 --> 00:29:55.22
we are obviously using a carriage.

410
00:29:55.22 --> 00:30:00.50
It must have been nearing dawn when I was awakened by the distant thunder of guns.

411
00:30:00.50 --> 00:30:07.94
I crouched in my corner, cold and cramped, trying to visualize the terror of it.

412
00:30:07.94 --> 00:30:12.50
I asked myself whether I was afraid.

413
00:30:12.50 --> 00:30:17.62
Not of death I told myself but of being afraid.

414
00:30:17.62 --> 00:30:19.70
Yes, most horribly.

415
00:30:19.70 --> 00:30:21.54
He was most horribly afraid.

416
00:30:21.54 --> 00:30:23.22
Not of death they're being wounded.

417
00:30:23.22 --> 00:30:24.82
He was afraid of being afraid.

418
00:30:24.82 --> 00:30:25.82
Yeah.

419
00:30:25.82 --> 00:30:37.50
This first experience in no man's land did away with my last Flabby fear.

420
00:30:37.50 --> 00:30:40.62
If I was afraid I would show it.

421
00:30:40.62 --> 00:30:45.74
One is often afraid and he soldier who asserts the contrary may not be a liar but he certainly

422
00:30:45.74 --> 00:30:49.02
does not speak the truth.

423
00:30:49.02 --> 00:30:52.90
Physical fear is too deeply rooted to be overcome by any amount of training.

424
00:30:52.90 --> 00:31:04.74
It remains then to train a man in spiritual pride so that when he fears nobody knows it.

425
00:31:04.74 --> 00:31:06.82
Cowardous is contagious.

426
00:31:06.82 --> 00:31:14.22
It has been said that no battalion is braver than its least brave member.

427
00:31:14.22 --> 00:31:21.86
Military courage therefore is a form of unselfishness.

428
00:31:21.86 --> 00:31:30.18
It is practiced that it may save the weaker men's lives and uphold their honor.

429
00:31:30.18 --> 00:31:38.58
The worst thing you can say of a man out on the front is that he doesn't play the game.

430
00:31:38.58 --> 00:31:39.82
That doesn't have necessity.

431
00:31:39.82 --> 00:31:41.46
He fails to do his duty.

432
00:31:41.46 --> 00:31:42.70
Listen to this.

433
00:31:42.70 --> 00:31:45.02
That doesn't mean he fails to do his duty.

434
00:31:45.02 --> 00:31:51.74
What it means is that he fails to do a bit more than his duty.

435
00:31:51.74 --> 00:31:58.22
In a man plays the game he does things which it requires a braver man than himself to

436
00:31:58.22 --> 00:32:00.26
accomplish.

437
00:32:00.26 --> 00:32:01.70
He never knows when he's done.

438
00:32:01.70 --> 00:32:05.82
He acknowledges no limit to his cheerfulness and strength.

439
00:32:05.82 --> 00:32:14.26
Whatever his rank holds his life less valuable than that of the humblest.

440
00:32:14.26 --> 00:32:20.14
He laughs at danger not because he does not dread it but because he has learnt that there

441
00:32:20.14 --> 00:32:33.10
are ailments more terrible and less curable than death.

442
00:32:33.10 --> 00:32:45.42
ailments more terrible and less curable than death and that ailment is cowardice.

443
00:32:45.42 --> 00:32:51.58
Until I became a part of the war I was a doubter of the nobility and others and a skeptic

444
00:32:51.58 --> 00:32:54.82
as regards to myself.

445
00:32:54.82 --> 00:33:00.26
The growth of my personal vision was complete when I recognized that the capacity of heroism

446
00:33:00.26 --> 00:33:14.02
is latent in everybody and only awaits the bigness of the opportunity to call it out.

447
00:33:14.02 --> 00:33:18.90
Different take.

448
00:33:18.90 --> 00:33:26.74
Obviously we talked about World War I and the less he's not the only person that felt

449
00:33:26.74 --> 00:33:33.54
this way about things and if this wasn't at least a fairly normal attitude to have there's

450
00:33:33.54 --> 00:33:37.30
no way that World War I could have continued on the way it did because people would have

451
00:33:37.30 --> 00:33:41.66
been saying no this is ridiculous.

452
00:33:41.66 --> 00:33:44.86
We just lost another 80,000 casualties.

453
00:33:44.86 --> 00:33:46.26
We lost another 100.

454
00:33:46.26 --> 00:33:54.46
These are battles where tens of thousands of people were casualties in one day and two days.

455
00:33:54.46 --> 00:33:58.14
So if people didn't have this kind of attitude that this was their duty they wouldn't have

456
00:33:58.14 --> 00:34:04.94
been able to maintain that type of that type of pace.

457
00:34:04.94 --> 00:34:15.78
And I don't even know whether to say I'm impressed by that or disgusted by it or disturbed.

458
00:34:15.78 --> 00:34:19.82
I didn't even have not disgusted but disturbed by it.

459
00:34:19.82 --> 00:34:21.82
Disurbed by it.

460
00:34:21.82 --> 00:34:25.98
And I would say all the time, you know this is the war that I would not want to fight

461
00:34:25.98 --> 00:34:26.98
it.

462
00:34:26.98 --> 00:34:29.26
Wouldn't want to fight it.

463
00:34:29.26 --> 00:34:34.90
Because this is the attitude is okay, your duty is to go get killed when we call.

464
00:34:34.90 --> 00:34:36.54
And it's just a matter how good.

465
00:34:36.54 --> 00:34:37.54
I say this all the time.

466
00:34:37.54 --> 00:34:41.66
It doesn't matter how good your tactics are, it doesn't matter how good of a leader you

467
00:34:41.66 --> 00:34:45.26
are because when we say go you're going to get your troops you're going to do what we say

468
00:34:45.26 --> 00:34:48.38
you're going to go over the top of your charge machine guns and guys you're going to

469
00:34:48.38 --> 00:34:55.22
get mode down.

470
00:34:55.22 --> 00:35:03.54
Now he goes into a little bit more about some of the battle.

471
00:35:03.54 --> 00:35:09.06
Back to the book, all this April, high above the shouting of the guns are larks.

472
00:35:09.06 --> 00:35:15.38
The larks, saying joyously, the scarlet of the poppies, the song of the larks, the lamp shining

473
00:35:15.38 --> 00:35:22.02
on the altar are the only external signs of the uncorcomable happy religion which lies

474
00:35:22.02 --> 00:35:25.38
in the hearts of our men.

475
00:35:25.38 --> 00:35:33.46
Their religion is the religion of heroism which they have learned in the glory

476
00:35:33.46 --> 00:35:36.98
of the trenches.

477
00:35:36.98 --> 00:35:42.86
There was a line from William Morris's earthly paradise which is like a long epic poem.

478
00:35:42.86 --> 00:35:48.30
It's almost like a novel which used to haunt me especially in the early days when I was

479
00:35:48.30 --> 00:35:51.74
first experiencing what war really meant.

480
00:35:51.74 --> 00:35:58.18
It reads his follows of heaven or hell I have no power to sing.

481
00:35:58.18 --> 00:36:07.30
I cannot ease the burden of your fears or make quick coming death a little thing.

482
00:36:07.30 --> 00:36:13.66
It's the last line that makes me smile rather quietly or make quick coming death a little

483
00:36:13.66 --> 00:36:15.38
thing.

484
00:36:15.38 --> 00:36:29.18
I smile because the souls who wear khaki have learned to do just that.

485
00:36:29.18 --> 00:36:34.22
These guys, this fear of death that people have and this poem that says, hey you can't

486
00:36:34.22 --> 00:36:35.94
make quick death.

487
00:36:35.94 --> 00:36:37.70
Quick coming death, you can't make that into a little thing.

488
00:36:37.70 --> 00:36:40.06
It's going to be huge anomalous.

489
00:36:40.06 --> 00:36:41.06
Guess what?

490
00:36:41.06 --> 00:36:45.06
These guys are okay with it.

491
00:36:45.06 --> 00:36:51.94
Back to the book, how typical he is of the days before the war when the people had only

492
00:36:51.94 --> 00:36:54.74
pinprix to endure.

493
00:36:54.74 --> 00:36:58.74
And consequently didn't exert themselves to be brave.

494
00:36:58.74 --> 00:37:05.02
A big sacrifice which bank rubs one's life is always more bearable than the little

495
00:37:05.02 --> 00:37:11.54
inevitable annoyances of sickness, disappointment and dying in a bed.

496
00:37:11.54 --> 00:37:18.54
The burden of our fears has slipped from our shoulders in our attempt to do something for

497
00:37:18.54 --> 00:37:20.90
others.

498
00:37:20.90 --> 00:37:28.74
The unbelievable and long-covided miracle has happened at last to every soul who has grasped

499
00:37:28.74 --> 00:37:39.02
his chance of heroism, quick coming death has become a fifth rate calamity.

500
00:37:39.02 --> 00:37:40.02
Think about that.

501
00:37:40.02 --> 00:37:42.26
Never get whatever.

502
00:37:42.26 --> 00:37:43.26
Whatever.

503
00:37:43.26 --> 00:37:44.26
You're no big deal to me.

504
00:37:44.26 --> 00:37:49.70
You're a fifth rate calamity.

505
00:37:49.70 --> 00:37:50.70
Back to the book.

506
00:37:50.70 --> 00:37:55.42
In saying this, I do not mean to glorify war.

507
00:37:55.42 --> 00:37:59.90
War can never be anything but beastly and damnable.

508
00:37:59.90 --> 00:38:06.26
It dates back to the jungle, but there are two kinds of war.

509
00:38:06.26 --> 00:38:11.94
There's the kind that highway men wages when he pounces from the bushes and assaults a

510
00:38:11.94 --> 00:38:15.46
defenseless woman.

511
00:38:15.46 --> 00:38:21.22
Then there's also the kind where you wage when you go to rescue her.

512
00:38:21.22 --> 00:38:27.30
The highway man can't expect to come out of that fight with a loft or your morality, but

513
00:38:27.30 --> 00:38:29.78
you can.

514
00:38:29.78 --> 00:38:31.82
Our chaps never want to defy.

515
00:38:31.82 --> 00:38:34.62
They hate fighting.

516
00:38:34.62 --> 00:38:42.10
It's that hatred of the thing they are compelled to do that makes them so terrible.

517
00:38:42.10 --> 00:38:49.06
He goes back and he's talking now about that wooden figure of Christ that he had seen.

518
00:38:49.06 --> 00:38:55.22
The wooden Christ gays down from them on his cross with a suffering which 2,000 years

519
00:38:55.22 --> 00:38:59.06
ago he had shared.

520
00:38:59.06 --> 00:39:04.74
The terrible pity of his silence seemed to be telling them that they had become one with him

521
00:39:04.74 --> 00:39:07.70
in their final sacrifice.

522
00:39:07.70 --> 00:39:17.18
They hadn't lived his life far from it, but unknowingly they had died his death.

523
00:39:17.18 --> 00:39:23.70
That's a part of the glory of the trenches that a man who has not been good can crucify

524
00:39:23.70 --> 00:39:29.58
himself and hang beside Christ in the end.

525
00:39:29.58 --> 00:39:36.46
So go out on the battlefield and you sacrifice your life, you will, all of your sins are

526
00:39:36.46 --> 00:39:50.66
gone, you're washed away and you hang beside Christ in the end.

527
00:39:50.66 --> 00:39:57.78
God as we see him and do we see him, I think so, but not always consciously.

528
00:39:57.78 --> 00:40:02.58
He moves among us in the forms of our brother men.

529
00:40:02.58 --> 00:40:09.14
We see him most evidently when danger is most threatening and courage is at its highest.

530
00:40:09.14 --> 00:40:11.34
We often don't recognize him out loud.

531
00:40:11.34 --> 00:40:15.70
Our chaps don't assert that there is fellow campaigners.

532
00:40:15.70 --> 00:40:19.62
They're too humble-minded and inarticulate for that.

533
00:40:19.62 --> 00:40:25.54
So he's saying, God's all around us, I see it in the guys, they're his campaigners,

534
00:40:25.54 --> 00:40:27.54
but they don't even, they don't say that.

535
00:40:27.54 --> 00:40:29.10
They don't say we're doing the work of God.

536
00:40:29.10 --> 00:40:32.54
They don't say we're living like God or we're living like Jesus Christ.

537
00:40:32.54 --> 00:40:37.70
No, they're too humble-minded and inarticulate for that.

538
00:40:37.70 --> 00:40:44.26
They're where they are because they want to do their bit, their duty.

539
00:40:44.26 --> 00:40:50.50
They're carefully disguised instinctive honor brought them there.

540
00:40:50.50 --> 00:40:59.42
Doing their bit in Bible language means laying down their lives for their friends.

541
00:40:59.42 --> 00:41:03.94
Doing their bit that covers everything.

542
00:41:03.94 --> 00:41:06.94
Here's an example of how God walks among us.

543
00:41:06.94 --> 00:41:11.90
In one of our attacks on the Psalm, all the observers up forward were uncertain as to what

544
00:41:11.90 --> 00:41:13.30
it happened.

545
00:41:13.30 --> 00:41:17.22
We didn't know whether our infantry had captured their objective, failed or gone beyond

546
00:41:17.22 --> 00:41:18.22
it.

547
00:41:18.22 --> 00:41:23.86
The battlefield, as far as the eye could reach, was a bath of mud.

548
00:41:23.86 --> 00:41:28.10
It is extremely easy and the excitement of an offensive when all landmarks are blotted

549
00:41:28.10 --> 00:41:31.30
out for our storming parties to lose their direction.

550
00:41:31.30 --> 00:41:34.70
If this happens, a number of dangers may result.

551
00:41:34.70 --> 00:41:38.90
Of Italian may find itself up in the air, which means that it failed to connect with the

552
00:41:38.90 --> 00:41:41.10
battalions on its left and right.

553
00:41:41.10 --> 00:41:45.10
This flanks are then exposed to the enemy.

554
00:41:45.10 --> 00:41:49.94
It may advance too far and start digging itself in at a point where it was previously

555
00:41:49.94 --> 00:41:55.10
arranged that our artillery should place their protective wall of fire.

556
00:41:55.10 --> 00:42:00.86
We, being forward artillery observers, are the eyes of the army.

557
00:42:00.86 --> 00:42:05.22
It is our business to watch for such contingencies to keep in touch with the situation

558
00:42:05.22 --> 00:42:10.62
as it progresses and to send our information back as quickly as possible.

559
00:42:10.62 --> 00:42:15.86
We were peering through our glasses from our point of vantage wind, far away in the thickest

560
00:42:15.86 --> 00:42:21.58
of the battle smoke we saw a white flag waving, sending back messages.

561
00:42:21.58 --> 00:42:24.94
The flag waving was repeatedly desperate.

562
00:42:24.94 --> 00:42:30.06
It was evident that no one had replied and probably that no one had picked up the messages.

563
00:42:30.06 --> 00:42:34.34
A signal who was with us, read the language for us.

564
00:42:34.34 --> 00:42:36.98
A company of infantry had advanced too far.

565
00:42:36.98 --> 00:42:40.30
They were most of them wounded.

566
00:42:40.30 --> 00:42:43.94
Very many of them dead and were in danger of being surrounded.

567
00:42:43.94 --> 00:42:48.66
They asked for artillery to place a curtain of fire in front of them and for reinforcements

568
00:42:48.66 --> 00:42:53.02
to be sent up.

569
00:42:53.02 --> 00:42:54.26
So they are in their trench.

570
00:42:54.26 --> 00:42:55.78
They are the artillery guys.

571
00:42:55.78 --> 00:42:56.78
They are looking out.

572
00:42:56.78 --> 00:43:00.86
They see flag which is one of the methodologies they had for signaling and communicating.

573
00:43:00.86 --> 00:43:01.86
You do these different signals.

574
00:43:01.86 --> 00:43:06.46
You can spell out words and so they are getting a signal back from this group that they might

575
00:43:06.46 --> 00:43:07.46
get surrounded.

576
00:43:07.46 --> 00:43:11.26
We are more artillery support in here.

577
00:43:11.26 --> 00:43:16.14
We at once famed the orders through to our artillery and notify the infantry headquarters

578
00:43:16.14 --> 00:43:19.38
of the division that was holding the front.

579
00:43:19.38 --> 00:43:24.18
But it was necessary to let those chaps know that we were aware of their predicament.

580
00:43:24.18 --> 00:43:26.74
They'd hang on if they knew that.

581
00:43:26.74 --> 00:43:35.70
Otherwise, without orders our signaler was getting his flags ready, he hopped on to the

582
00:43:35.70 --> 00:43:37.78
trench.

583
00:43:37.78 --> 00:43:40.62
He hopped out of the trench and onto the parapet.

584
00:43:40.62 --> 00:43:43.70
He didn't stand a 50-50 chance.

585
00:43:43.70 --> 00:43:50.26
The hunt was familiar with our observation station and strafed it with persistent regularity.

586
00:43:50.26 --> 00:43:53.34
The signaler turned to the senior officer present.

587
00:43:53.34 --> 00:43:55.34
What shall I send them?

588
00:43:55.34 --> 00:44:00.06
Tell them their messages have been received and that help is coming.

589
00:44:00.06 --> 00:44:02.90
Out the chaps scrambled, a flag in either hand.

590
00:44:02.90 --> 00:44:05.14
He was nothing but a boy.

591
00:44:05.14 --> 00:44:09.02
He ran, crouching like a rabbit to a hump of mud where his figure would show up against

592
00:44:09.02 --> 00:44:10.34
the sky.

593
00:44:10.34 --> 00:44:14.74
His flags commenced a waving, messages received help coming.

594
00:44:14.74 --> 00:44:16.22
They didn't see him at first.

595
00:44:16.22 --> 00:44:17.78
He had to repeat the words.

596
00:44:17.78 --> 00:44:20.70
We watched him breathlessly.

597
00:44:20.70 --> 00:44:23.14
We knew what would happen.

598
00:44:23.14 --> 00:44:26.10
At last, it did happen.

599
00:44:26.10 --> 00:44:30.62
A horn observer had spotted him and flashed the target back to his guns.

600
00:44:30.62 --> 00:44:35.50
All about him, the mud commenced to leap up and bubble.

601
00:44:35.50 --> 00:44:39.66
He went on signaling the good word to those stranded men up front.

602
00:44:39.66 --> 00:44:42.42
Message received, help coming.

603
00:44:42.42 --> 00:44:44.30
At least they'd seen him.

604
00:44:44.30 --> 00:44:46.06
They were signaling okay.

605
00:44:46.06 --> 00:44:53.18
It was at that moment that a whiz bang lifted him off his feet and landed him all of

606
00:44:53.18 --> 00:44:55.78
a huddle.

607
00:44:55.78 --> 00:44:57.82
His bit.

608
00:44:57.82 --> 00:45:04.26
He was what he'd volunteered to do when he came from Canada.

609
00:45:04.26 --> 00:45:16.62
The signal okay in the battle smoke was like a testimony to his character.

610
00:45:16.62 --> 00:45:21.70
So like I said, this had to be a common attitude and it's just hard for us to understand.

611
00:45:21.70 --> 00:45:25.90
It's hard for me that was in the military for 20 years to understand this attitude

612
00:45:25.90 --> 00:45:28.54
that you know what, it's your time to die now.

613
00:45:28.54 --> 00:45:31.58
Step up and pass their signaling back to them.

614
00:45:31.58 --> 00:45:35.42
I'm not saying that modern military guys don't take risks.

615
00:45:35.42 --> 00:45:41.58
Obviously take them enormous risks and we've got taken drastic casualties.

616
00:45:41.58 --> 00:45:44.54
But it is, this is definitely a different mentality.

617
00:45:44.54 --> 00:45:45.54
There's no doubt about it.

618
00:45:45.54 --> 00:45:52.46
Obviously it's a different mentality when you're losing millions of men.

619
00:45:52.46 --> 00:46:01.18
The millions of men.

620
00:46:01.18 --> 00:46:05.14
Back to the book and this is fast forward a little bit to kind of just giving a little

621
00:46:05.14 --> 00:46:09.58
more insight about what their outlook was.

622
00:46:09.58 --> 00:46:14.26
Out there in France, we used to tell each other fairy tales of how we would spend the first

623
00:46:14.26 --> 00:46:18.06
year of life when the war was ended.

624
00:46:18.06 --> 00:46:21.10
One man had a baby who had never seen.

625
00:46:21.10 --> 00:46:24.30
Another girl whom he was anxious to marry.

626
00:46:24.30 --> 00:46:28.66
My dream was more prosaic but no less ecstatic.

627
00:46:28.66 --> 00:46:34.54
It began and ended with a large white bed and a large white bath.

628
00:46:34.54 --> 00:46:40.90
For the first 365 mornings after peace had been declared, I was to be awakened by the sound

629
00:46:40.90 --> 00:46:44.14
of my bath being filled.

630
00:46:44.14 --> 00:46:49.74
Water was to be so plentiful that I could tumble off to sleep again without even troubling

631
00:46:49.74 --> 00:46:52.22
to turn off the tap.

632
00:46:52.22 --> 00:46:57.14
In France, one has to go dirty so often that the dream of always being cleaned seems

633
00:46:57.14 --> 00:47:01.18
as unrealizable as romance.

634
00:47:01.18 --> 00:47:07.62
Our drinking water is frequently brought up to us at the risk of men's lives.

635
00:47:07.62 --> 00:47:12.22
Carried through the mud and petrol can strap to pack horses.

636
00:47:12.22 --> 00:47:20.22
To use it carelessly would be like washing in men's blood.

637
00:47:20.22 --> 00:47:25.10
Here's another little paragraph again giving some more insight.

638
00:47:25.10 --> 00:47:31.50
You wouldn't think that the men would go to war to learn how to be kind but they do.

639
00:47:31.50 --> 00:47:35.90
There's no kind or creature in the whole wide world in the average Tommy.

640
00:47:35.90 --> 00:47:38.98
He makes a friend of any stray animal he can find.

641
00:47:38.98 --> 00:47:42.18
He shares his last friend with a chap who isn't his pal.

642
00:47:42.18 --> 00:47:48.18
He risks his life to die in consequently to rescue anyone who's elounded.

643
00:47:48.18 --> 00:47:53.70
He's gone over the top with the bomb and bayonet for the express purpose of doing in the

644
00:47:53.70 --> 00:47:55.54
hunt.

645
00:47:55.54 --> 00:47:58.74
But he makes a comrade of the fritzy he captures.

646
00:47:58.74 --> 00:48:03.42
You'll seem coming down the battered trenches with some scarred lad of a German at his

647
00:48:03.42 --> 00:48:14.42
side.

648
00:48:14.42 --> 00:48:21.10
Now he as I said in the beginning this we he gets wounded and at this point he's been wounded

649
00:48:21.10 --> 00:48:26.62
and now he's heading to Blighty which we talked about this before on the podcast.

650
00:48:26.62 --> 00:48:32.66
But Blighty was slaying for going back to England.

651
00:48:32.66 --> 00:48:39.54
Back to the book never in all my fortnight journey to Blighty did I hear a word of self pity

652
00:48:39.54 --> 00:48:40.82
or complaining.

653
00:48:40.82 --> 00:48:43.18
So he's going to the bunch of wounded people he's not hearing any complaining.

654
00:48:43.18 --> 00:48:48.02
On the contrary the most severely wounded men would profess themselves grateful that they had

655
00:48:48.02 --> 00:48:50.58
gotten off so lightly.

656
00:48:50.58 --> 00:48:55.26
Since the war started to turn lightly has become exceedingly comparative.

657
00:48:55.26 --> 00:49:01.06
I suppose a man is justified in saying he's got off lightly when what he expected was

658
00:49:01.06 --> 00:49:04.50
death.

659
00:49:04.50 --> 00:49:09.46
I remember a big highland officer who'd been shot in the kneecap.

660
00:49:09.46 --> 00:49:13.22
He'd been operated on and the kneecap had been found to be so splintered it had to be

661
00:49:13.22 --> 00:49:17.02
removed of this he was unaware.

662
00:49:17.02 --> 00:49:22.38
For the first day as he lay in bed he kept wondering aloud how long it would be before

663
00:49:22.38 --> 00:49:26.02
he could rejoin his battalion.

664
00:49:26.02 --> 00:49:30.38
Perhaps he suspected his condition and was trying to find out.

665
00:49:30.38 --> 00:49:36.98
All his heart seemed set at once on getting back into the fighting.

666
00:49:36.98 --> 00:49:42.74
Next morning he plucked up the courage to ask the doctor and received the answer he

667
00:49:42.74 --> 00:49:44.62
had dreaded.

668
00:49:44.62 --> 00:49:50.06
Never you won't be going back old chap.

669
00:49:50.06 --> 00:49:56.30
Next time he spoke his voice was a bit throaty will it stiffen?

670
00:49:56.30 --> 00:50:02.18
You've lost the knee joint the doctor said but with luck we'll save the leg.

671
00:50:02.18 --> 00:50:05.02
His voice sank to a whisper.

672
00:50:05.02 --> 00:50:09.58
If you do it won't be much good will it?

673
00:50:09.58 --> 00:50:13.10
Not much said the doctor.

674
00:50:13.10 --> 00:50:19.46
He lay for a couple hours silent, readjusting his mind to meet the new conditions.

675
00:50:19.46 --> 00:50:25.78
Then he commenced talking with cheerfulness about returning to his family.

676
00:50:25.78 --> 00:50:27.94
The habit of courage it conquered.

677
00:50:27.94 --> 00:50:33.98
The habit of courage which grows out of knowledge that you let your pals down by showing

678
00:50:33.98 --> 00:50:34.94
cowardice.

679
00:50:34.94 --> 00:50:41.78
So, took him a couple hours to adjust and said okay.

680
00:50:41.78 --> 00:50:49.90
Looks like I can get to go back to my family.

681
00:50:49.90 --> 00:50:58.26
Now we have another type of casualty here talking about men that have had major disfigurements

682
00:50:58.26 --> 00:51:06.46
to their faces and they would wrap their whole faces up.

683
00:51:06.46 --> 00:51:07.46
Back to the book.

684
00:51:07.46 --> 00:51:12.06
In these days that followed I saw several of these masked men.

685
00:51:12.06 --> 00:51:16.90
The worst cases were not allowed to walk about.

686
00:51:16.90 --> 00:51:22.62
The ones I saw were invariably dressed with the most scrupulous care in the smartest

687
00:51:22.62 --> 00:51:24.22
uniforms.

688
00:51:24.22 --> 00:51:30.86
Sam Browns, the best adult that goes over your shoulder, polished buttons, shining.

689
00:51:30.86 --> 00:51:36.02
They had hope and took a pride in themselves, a splendid sign.

690
00:51:36.02 --> 00:51:41.98
Perhaps you ask why the faces kept the face cases should be kept in front so the guys

691
00:51:41.98 --> 00:51:50.54
that had major facial disfigurements they would stay in France.

692
00:51:50.54 --> 00:51:54.70
I was not told but I can guess because they dread going back to England to their girls

693
00:51:54.70 --> 00:51:57.34
until they got rid of their disfigurements.

694
00:51:57.34 --> 00:52:03.34
So for two years through their bandages they watched the train pull out for Blady.

695
00:52:03.34 --> 00:52:19.46
All the damage which was done to them in a fragment of the second is repaired.

696
00:52:19.46 --> 00:52:23.90
At a base hospital you see something you don't see at casualty stations.

697
00:52:23.90 --> 00:52:30.02
Sisters, mothers, sweethearts and wives sitting beside the beds.

698
00:52:30.02 --> 00:52:34.66
They're allowed to come over from England when their man is dying.

699
00:52:34.66 --> 00:52:38.42
One of the wonderful things to me was to observe how these women in the hour of their

700
00:52:38.42 --> 00:52:42.66
tragedy catch this soldier's spirit.

701
00:52:42.66 --> 00:52:47.10
They're very quiet, very cheerful, very helpful.

702
00:52:47.10 --> 00:52:51.66
While passing through the ward they get to know some of the other patients and remember

703
00:52:51.66 --> 00:52:53.30
them.

704
00:52:53.30 --> 00:52:57.90
When they bring their own man flowers, sometimes when their own man is asleep they slip

705
00:52:57.90 --> 00:53:02.46
over to other bedcites and do something kind for the solitary fellows.

706
00:53:02.46 --> 00:53:04.30
That's the army all over.

707
00:53:04.30 --> 00:53:09.58
Military discipline is based on unselfishness.

708
00:53:09.58 --> 00:53:15.86
These women who have been sent to see their men die catch from them the spirit of undistressed

709
00:53:15.86 --> 00:53:23.42
sacrifice and enroll themselves as soldiers.

710
00:53:23.42 --> 00:53:29.90
You discover the spirit of the man when you've heard him wandering in delirium.

711
00:53:29.90 --> 00:53:36.14
So you talk in a little bit about the obviously guys that are suffering from shell shock

712
00:53:36.14 --> 00:53:40.02
is what they call it, what they used to call it in World War I.

713
00:53:40.02 --> 00:53:46.30
Guys that are having some mental issues all night in the shadowy ward with its hooded

714
00:53:46.30 --> 00:53:47.30
lamps.

715
00:53:47.30 --> 00:53:49.82
He would be giving orders for the comfort of his men.

716
00:53:49.82 --> 00:53:53.54
Sometimes he'd be proposing to go forward himself to a place where a company was having

717
00:53:53.54 --> 00:53:55.34
a hot time.

718
00:53:55.34 --> 00:53:58.46
Apparently one of his officers was trying to dissuade him.

719
00:53:58.46 --> 00:54:01.90
Danger be damned, he'd exclaim in a wonderfully strong voice.

720
00:54:01.90 --> 00:54:12.50
It'll buck him up to see me, splendid japs, splendid japs.

721
00:54:12.50 --> 00:54:17.30
For the soldier it seems that the war has always been and that they will never cease

722
00:54:17.30 --> 00:54:18.74
to being soldiers.

723
00:54:18.74 --> 00:54:26.90
For them both the past and the future are utterly obliterated.

724
00:54:26.90 --> 00:54:34.46
They would not have it otherwise, because they are doing their duty they are contented.

725
00:54:34.46 --> 00:54:39.94
The only time the subject is ever touched on is when someone expresses the hope that

726
00:54:39.94 --> 00:54:45.66
it'll last long enough for them to recover from his wounds and get back to the line.

727
00:54:45.66 --> 00:54:51.66
That usually starts another man who will never be any good, never be any more good for the

728
00:54:51.66 --> 00:54:56.90
trenches wondering whether he can get into the flying corps.

729
00:54:56.90 --> 00:55:02.78
The one ultimate hope of all these shattered wrecks who are being hurried to blighty.

730
00:55:02.78 --> 00:55:09.90
They have dreamt of is that they may see service again.

731
00:55:09.90 --> 00:55:12.06
We still hear that.

732
00:55:12.06 --> 00:55:17.06
We still hear that.

733
00:55:17.06 --> 00:55:18.70
I heard that.

734
00:55:18.70 --> 00:55:22.26
I talked about hearing that from Ryan Job who was blind and he's back at America and he's

735
00:55:22.26 --> 00:55:25.62
like let me come back.

736
00:55:25.62 --> 00:55:30.74
My first guy that I ever had would get wounded bad.

737
00:55:30.74 --> 00:55:36.38
I went to see him in the medical outstation.

738
00:55:36.38 --> 00:55:39.10
I just went down to like shake his hand and he was on morphing.

739
00:55:39.10 --> 00:55:43.74
He had been shot the leg. He didn't know if he was going to lose the leg or not.

740
00:55:43.74 --> 00:55:49.30
I went down and gave him, I went to shake his hand and he pulled me in and he's like

741
00:55:49.30 --> 00:55:52.02
let me stay.

742
00:55:52.02 --> 00:55:55.06
I was just like you man.

743
00:55:55.06 --> 00:55:56.98
What an awesome brother right there.

744
00:55:56.98 --> 00:55:57.98
This is not rare.

745
00:55:57.98 --> 00:55:58.98
This still happens.

746
00:55:58.98 --> 00:56:00.62
You hear this all the time.

747
00:56:00.62 --> 00:56:09.06
There's guys in the US military that go back to combat with one leg with one hand.

748
00:56:09.06 --> 00:56:13.66
I mean, even Jodi was like talking about, you know, when he woke up and showed him

749
00:56:13.66 --> 00:56:15.38
a medical who he was in the park.

750
00:56:15.38 --> 00:56:20.10
When he woke up and he found out that they took both of his legs.

751
00:56:20.10 --> 00:56:24.66
He was pissed because one leg you can still go back on the planet but two leg can't do

752
00:56:24.66 --> 00:56:25.66
it.

753
00:56:25.66 --> 00:56:31.02
So Jodi the badass was just like, no look.

754
00:56:31.02 --> 00:56:37.26
How am I going to go back now?

755
00:56:37.26 --> 00:56:42.30
Some of us will be back in the fighting and Jolly Glad of it.

756
00:56:42.30 --> 00:56:46.26
Others are doomed to remain in the trenches for the rest of their lives, not the trenches

757
00:56:46.26 --> 00:56:52.18
of the front line where they've been strafed by the hunt, but the trenches of physical

758
00:56:52.18 --> 00:56:59.42
curtailment where self-pity will launch wave after wave of attack against them.

759
00:56:59.42 --> 00:57:05.50
It won't be easy not to get the wind up.

760
00:57:05.50 --> 00:57:11.94
It'll be difficult to maintain normal cheerfulness but they're not the men they were before

761
00:57:11.94 --> 00:57:13.90
they went to war.

762
00:57:13.90 --> 00:57:16.54
Out there they've learned something.

763
00:57:16.54 --> 00:57:20.94
Their game, they'll remain soldiers whatever happens.

764
00:57:20.94 --> 00:57:27.46
So he's talking about these guys that are aren't going to be able to make it back and

765
00:57:27.46 --> 00:57:31.70
he's saying they're going to be hard for him.

766
00:57:31.70 --> 00:57:34.98
But he's saying that they're game but they're going to bring it.

767
00:57:34.98 --> 00:57:40.06
Is there going to remain soldiers regardless of what happens?

768
00:57:40.06 --> 00:57:47.94
Now this is a pretty interesting piece where he goes back to New York where like I said

769
00:57:47.94 --> 00:57:53.94
he had spent some time there and he's talking a little about what it's like in New York.

770
00:57:53.94 --> 00:57:59.22
He says there's one person I've missed since my return to New York.

771
00:57:59.22 --> 00:58:04.90
I've caught glimpses of him disappearing around corners but he dodges.

772
00:58:04.90 --> 00:58:08.98
I think he's a bit ashamed to meet me.

773
00:58:08.98 --> 00:58:14.10
That person is my old civilian self.

774
00:58:14.10 --> 00:58:17.74
What a full blown egoist he used to be.

775
00:58:17.74 --> 00:58:21.94
How full of gold and plans for his own advancement.

776
00:58:21.94 --> 00:58:32.66
How terrified of failure, of disease, of money losses, of death, of all the temporary external,

777
00:58:32.66 --> 00:58:40.42
non-essential things that have nothing to do with the spirit.

778
00:58:40.42 --> 00:58:46.94
War in itself is damnable.

779
00:58:46.94 --> 00:58:58.34
It's a extravagant, wasteful use of resources, a misuse of accumulated brain stuff of centuries.

780
00:58:58.34 --> 00:59:04.94
Nevertheless, there's many a man who has no love of war, who previous the war had cramped

781
00:59:04.94 --> 00:59:10.82
his soul with littleness and was chased by the bayonet of duty into the bloodstained

782
00:59:10.82 --> 00:59:22.10
largeness of the trenches who is alert to say thank God for this war.

783
00:59:22.10 --> 00:59:27.10
He thinks God not because of the carnage.

784
00:59:27.10 --> 00:59:34.26
But because when the wine-pressive new ideals was being trotting, he was born in an age

785
00:59:34.26 --> 00:59:41.26
where he could do his share.

786
00:59:41.26 --> 00:59:47.66
Often at the front, I have thought of Christ's explanation of his own unassailable peace.

787
00:59:47.66 --> 00:59:52.98
An explanation given to his disciples at the last supper, be of good cheer I have overcome

788
00:59:52.98 --> 00:59:55.70
the world.

789
00:59:55.70 --> 01:00:02.54
Overcoming the world, as I understand it, is overcoming fear.

790
01:00:02.54 --> 01:00:07.98
And it's final analysis is nothing but selfishness.

791
01:00:07.98 --> 01:00:14.34
A man who is afraid in the attack isn't thinking of his pals, of his pals, and how quickly

792
01:00:14.34 --> 01:00:15.58
terror spreads.

793
01:00:15.58 --> 01:00:19.62
He isn't thinking of the glory which we will accrue to his regiment or division if the

794
01:00:19.62 --> 01:00:21.22
attack is a success.

795
01:00:21.22 --> 01:00:26.06
He isn't thinking of what he can do to contribute to that success.

796
01:00:26.06 --> 01:00:33.30
He isn't thinking of the splendor of forcing his spirit to triumph over weiriness and

797
01:00:33.30 --> 01:00:40.06
nerves and the abominations that the hunts are chucking at him.

798
01:00:40.06 --> 01:00:47.30
He's merely thinking of how he can save his worthless skin and conduct his entirely

799
01:00:47.30 --> 01:01:00.10
unimportant body to a place where there aren't any shells.

800
01:01:00.10 --> 01:01:07.02
In London, as I saw the work of day, unconscious nobility of the maimed and wounded, the

801
01:01:07.02 --> 01:01:12.34
words I have overcome the world took an added depth.

802
01:01:12.34 --> 01:01:18.58
All these men have a eye of overcome the world looking their faces.

803
01:01:18.58 --> 01:01:26.34
It is comparatively easy for a soldier with traditions and ideals to get back to face

804
01:01:26.34 --> 01:01:37.26
death calmly, to become in the face of life as these chaps are takes graver courage.

805
01:01:37.26 --> 01:01:40.14
What has happened to them?

806
01:01:40.14 --> 01:01:43.10
Is attitude of mind or greatness of soul?

807
01:01:43.10 --> 01:01:49.58
Whatever you like to call it was learned in the trenches, where everything outward is polluted

808
01:01:49.58 --> 01:01:52.58
and damnable.

809
01:01:52.58 --> 01:02:00.82
Their experience at the front has given them what in the army language is known as guts,

810
01:02:00.82 --> 01:02:06.10
courage is an attitude of mind towards calamity and attitude of mind which makes the

811
01:02:06.10 --> 01:02:16.02
honorable accomplishing of duty more permanently satisfying than the preservation of self.

812
01:02:16.02 --> 01:02:22.14
Like I said, when I kicked this off, this is a different powerful angle to look at these

813
01:02:22.14 --> 01:02:23.14
things.

814
01:02:23.14 --> 01:02:24.14
I have talked about this as well.

815
01:02:24.14 --> 01:02:28.54
I don't know if you Sam Harris asked me.

816
01:02:28.54 --> 01:02:32.38
I was saying that hey, war shows you a lot of beauty in the juice where you get to see

817
01:02:32.38 --> 01:02:38.10
these incredible capacity of humanity.

818
01:02:38.10 --> 01:02:43.06
He said, you know, you say that, but I've also heard you describe war as horrible and

819
01:02:43.06 --> 01:02:48.70
I kind of gave him an answer about, you know, I asked him, I said, hey, if they've

820
01:02:48.70 --> 01:02:50.82
never known you, but survived cancer.

821
01:02:50.82 --> 01:02:56.70
He said, yes, and I'm like, yeah, and when they survive it, a lot of them say it opened

822
01:02:56.70 --> 01:03:01.06
my mind, it freed me from being afraid and it did all these wonderful things.

823
01:03:01.06 --> 01:03:06.46
I'm like, I would never wish it on anybody, but they don't, they don't wish that it

824
01:03:06.46 --> 01:03:07.46
didn't happen either.

825
01:03:07.46 --> 01:03:08.54
They learned so much from it.

826
01:03:08.54 --> 01:03:15.34
And that's how I feel about war and that's kind of what I read in a lot of this is Dawson

827
01:03:15.34 --> 01:03:23.58
saying, look, you are so changed by this and regardless of the horrors, the change is positive.

828
01:03:23.58 --> 01:03:31.70
It opens your eyes in a way that nothing else can.

829
01:03:31.70 --> 01:03:38.06
Back to the book, that's the kind of peep that God we got on the Western front.

830
01:03:38.06 --> 01:03:43.82
It is in the sad peep either, when men die for something worthwhile, death loses all its

831
01:03:43.82 --> 01:03:46.10
terror.

832
01:03:46.10 --> 01:03:52.62
It's peetering out in bed, from sickness or old age that's so horrifying.

833
01:03:52.62 --> 01:03:57.02
Many a man whose cowardice is at longer heads with a sense of duty comes to the front

834
01:03:57.02 --> 01:03:59.94
as a non-combatant.

835
01:03:59.94 --> 01:04:05.38
He compromises with his conscious and takes a bombproof job in some service whose places

836
01:04:05.38 --> 01:04:07.18
well behind the lines.

837
01:04:07.18 --> 01:04:10.22
So he's saying, okay, a lot of guys, they're like, hey, you know what, I'm kind of scared.

838
01:04:10.22 --> 01:04:13.38
I just want to, you know, just give me a easy job.

839
01:04:13.38 --> 01:04:16.86
Just, you know, I don't want to get killed.

840
01:04:16.86 --> 01:04:20.62
Back to the book, he doesn't stop there long.

841
01:04:20.62 --> 01:04:23.02
He's a decent, sir, sort.

842
01:04:23.02 --> 01:04:27.62
Having learned more than he ever guests before about the brutal things that Shellfire

843
01:04:27.62 --> 01:04:32.62
can do to you, he transfers into a fighting unit.

844
01:04:32.62 --> 01:04:34.62
Why?

845
01:04:34.62 --> 01:04:39.02
Because danger doesn't appall, it allures.

846
01:04:39.02 --> 01:04:40.62
It holds a challenge.

847
01:04:40.62 --> 01:04:42.94
It stings one's pride.

848
01:04:42.94 --> 01:04:47.78
It urges one to seek out ascending scales of risk.

849
01:04:47.78 --> 01:04:54.02
It's to prove to himself he isn't flabby.

850
01:04:54.02 --> 01:04:55.82
And flabby's actually another word that I looked up.

851
01:04:55.82 --> 01:05:00.22
There's an old, kind of capture what the real meaning is.

852
01:05:00.22 --> 01:05:02.22
And then there's the definition.

853
01:05:02.22 --> 01:05:07.50
Another definition is lacking strength or determination.

854
01:05:07.50 --> 01:05:10.94
Now this is classic.

855
01:05:10.94 --> 01:05:17.14
The safe job is the only job for which there's no competition in fighting units.

856
01:05:17.14 --> 01:05:24.26
You have to persuade men to be grooms or cooks or bat men.

857
01:05:24.26 --> 01:05:29.78
If you're seeking volunteers for a chance at annihilation, you'll have to cast lots to

858
01:05:29.78 --> 01:05:34.86
avoid the offense of rejecting.

859
01:05:34.86 --> 01:05:39.70
All of this is inexplicable to civilians.

860
01:05:39.70 --> 01:05:42.02
And again, this is something I saw with my own two eyes.

861
01:05:42.02 --> 01:05:44.54
And I talked about this in my retirement speech in Ramadi.

862
01:05:44.54 --> 01:05:48.42
And I was like, okay, we need volunteers who wants to go over and live in this hellhold

863
01:05:48.42 --> 01:05:52.02
and Eastern Ramadi and go out on operations where we're going to be taking casualties.

864
01:05:52.02 --> 01:05:56.14
It's going to be a nightmare and I can promise you nothing but blood, sweat, and tears.

865
01:05:56.14 --> 01:06:00.42
Who, if you want to go on that, if you want to go there, not not for one operation, but

866
01:06:00.42 --> 01:06:02.78
I'm going to put you there for six months.

867
01:06:02.78 --> 01:06:05.90
So who, you know, if you want that, put your name on the board.

868
01:06:05.90 --> 01:06:07.90
Every single guy does it.

869
01:06:07.90 --> 01:06:09.90
Every single guy does it.

870
01:06:09.90 --> 01:06:13.34
And that's exactly what he's talking about here.

871
01:06:13.34 --> 01:06:14.34
That's exactly how's it?

872
01:06:14.34 --> 01:06:17.22
As a matter of fact, I hooked up with a trooper down in New Zealand.

873
01:06:17.22 --> 01:06:18.94
Did you just do play or?

874
01:06:18.94 --> 01:06:20.94
And we were talking to you.

875
01:06:20.94 --> 01:06:27.58
He was using the in the commandos, in the Ramrian commandos, 40 commandos.

876
01:06:27.58 --> 01:06:34.10
And he was going to get moved to being a cook for his go four year duty as a cook.

877
01:06:34.10 --> 01:06:37.26
His work is going to get tasked with and he got out of the room.

878
01:06:37.26 --> 01:06:39.18
He got out of the room, rinse because you know what?

879
01:06:39.18 --> 01:06:40.90
He said, I'm not going to be a cook.

880
01:06:40.90 --> 01:06:43.18
You know, I'm a warrior.

881
01:06:43.18 --> 01:06:45.06
I want to go and get after it.

882
01:06:45.06 --> 01:06:49.70
So that's like, you see that, in this modern day, you know, I'm talking about how different

883
01:06:49.70 --> 01:06:52.18
it was back then, but maybe it was as different as I think it is.

884
01:06:52.18 --> 01:06:53.18
Yeah.

885
01:06:53.18 --> 01:06:57.18
Because we still got troopers that are just willing to step up all the time.

886
01:06:57.18 --> 01:06:58.38
And that's that's one thing that's awesome.

887
01:06:58.38 --> 01:07:03.18
You know, again, from my experience in the in the in the in the seal teams, you know,

888
01:07:03.18 --> 01:07:06.58
when I went in there was no war going on, I kind of thought that there was, but

889
01:07:06.58 --> 01:07:07.58
there wasn't.

890
01:07:07.58 --> 01:07:10.98
But these guys, these kids that come in now, they know where they're going.

891
01:07:10.98 --> 01:07:12.58
They know there's a war going on.

892
01:07:12.58 --> 01:07:14.58
They know they're going to get after it.

893
01:07:14.58 --> 01:07:16.58
And they're lining up.

894
01:07:16.58 --> 01:07:23.78
I know man, it's crazy how many people I see their reason to join is to go fight these bad

895
01:07:23.78 --> 01:07:24.78
guys.

896
01:07:24.78 --> 01:07:27.58
It's not because I don't have anything better to do or not.

897
01:07:27.58 --> 01:07:31.18
It's like, nah, I want to I want to quit my job and go fight.

898
01:07:31.18 --> 01:07:33.38
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

899
01:07:33.38 --> 01:07:38.18
No doubt about it.

900
01:07:38.18 --> 01:07:42.78
Now I like this because we start hammering on some philosophers a little bit.

901
01:07:42.78 --> 01:07:47.18
No offense to a Darryl Cooper and Margar made because he's a big philosophy guy.

902
01:07:47.18 --> 01:07:52.18
I know where you're at Cooper.

903
01:07:52.18 --> 01:07:53.58
I'm going to agree with Dawson on this one.

904
01:07:53.58 --> 01:07:54.58
Here we go.

905
01:07:54.58 --> 01:07:55.58
Back to the book.

906
01:07:55.58 --> 01:08:01.58
If civilian philosophers fail to explain us, we can explain them.

907
01:08:01.58 --> 01:08:06.58
In their world, they are the center of their universe.

908
01:08:06.58 --> 01:08:09.18
They look inward instead of outward.

909
01:08:09.18 --> 01:08:14.98
The sun rises and sets to minister to their particular happiness.

910
01:08:14.98 --> 01:08:20.78
If they die, the stars would vanish.

911
01:08:20.78 --> 01:08:27.78
We understand a few months ago, we too were like that.

912
01:08:27.78 --> 01:08:33.78
What makes us reckless of death is our intense gratitude that we have altered.

913
01:08:33.78 --> 01:08:43.50
We want to prove ourselves and access how utterly changed we are from what we were.

914
01:08:43.50 --> 01:08:51.58
In his secret heart, the egoist is a self-despisor.

915
01:08:51.58 --> 01:08:57.90
Can you imagine what a difference it works in a man after years of self-contempt at least

916
01:08:57.90 --> 01:09:02.82
for one brief moment to approve of himself?

917
01:09:02.82 --> 01:09:06.86
Since we can remember, we are chained to the prison house of our bodies.

918
01:09:06.86 --> 01:09:16.82
We live to feed our bodies to close our bodies to preserve our bodies to minister to their passions.

919
01:09:16.82 --> 01:09:25.70
Now we know that our bodies are mere flimsy shells in which our souls are paramount.

920
01:09:25.70 --> 01:09:27.94
We can fling them aside in a minute.

921
01:09:27.94 --> 01:09:29.50
They become ignoble.

922
01:09:29.50 --> 01:09:34.34
The moment the soul has departed, we have proof.

923
01:09:34.34 --> 01:09:43.74
Often, at zero hour, we have seen whole populations of cities go over the top in vanish.

924
01:09:43.74 --> 01:09:49.82
Weaving behind their bloody rags.

925
01:09:49.82 --> 01:09:53.94
We should go mad if we did not believe in immortality.

926
01:09:53.94 --> 01:09:56.90
We know that the physical is not the essential part.

927
01:09:56.90 --> 01:10:06.34
How better can a man shake off his flesh than at the hour when his spirit is most shining?

928
01:10:06.34 --> 01:10:13.78
The exact day when he dies does not matter tomorrow or 50 years hence, the vital concern

929
01:10:13.78 --> 01:10:16.98
is not when.

930
01:10:16.98 --> 01:10:21.50
But how?

931
01:10:21.50 --> 01:10:27.30
The civilian philosopher considers what we've lost.

932
01:10:27.30 --> 01:10:39.50
He forgets that it could never have been ours for long.

933
01:10:39.50 --> 01:10:40.50
Giving up the self.

934
01:10:40.50 --> 01:10:46.18
There's some Zen and I'm no Buddhist monk, but there's a lot of Zen philosophy in there,

935
01:10:46.18 --> 01:10:47.18
too.

936
01:10:47.18 --> 01:10:50.02
You're completely surrendering yourself.

937
01:10:50.02 --> 01:10:52.78
And that's a powerful, powerful thing.

938
01:10:52.78 --> 01:10:55.90
You look like you really liked that last part there.

939
01:10:55.90 --> 01:11:00.90
It's heavy stuff.

940
01:11:00.90 --> 01:11:06.14
Here he goes down the same vein, comparing civilian life.

941
01:11:06.14 --> 01:11:09.14
And so he was talking about civilian philosophers.

942
01:11:09.14 --> 01:11:14.70
Now he's going to go into just talking about the civilian, even how civilian spend their

943
01:11:14.70 --> 01:11:18.94
life and how he used to spend his life.

944
01:11:18.94 --> 01:11:20.14
Here we go back to the book.

945
01:11:20.14 --> 01:11:23.50
We probably caught a train in every morning.

946
01:11:23.50 --> 01:11:27.22
The same train we went to a business where we sat at a desk.

947
01:11:27.22 --> 01:11:31.26
Neither the business nor the desk ever altered.

948
01:11:31.26 --> 01:11:37.54
We received the same strafing from the same employer or if we were the employer we administered

949
01:11:37.54 --> 01:11:40.70
the same strafing.

950
01:11:40.70 --> 01:11:45.66
We only did these things that we might eat bread.

951
01:11:45.66 --> 01:11:56.78
Our dreams were all selfish of more clothes, more respect, more food, bigger houses.

952
01:11:56.78 --> 01:12:06.62
The least part of the day we've devoted to the people and the things we really cared for.

953
01:12:06.62 --> 01:12:16.78
And the people we loved, we weren't always even nice to them.

954
01:12:16.78 --> 01:12:21.62
And then he breaks and he goes into what it is being a soldier.

955
01:12:21.62 --> 01:12:29.26
He says, being a soldier is doing a man's job, doing it for someone else and unafraid to

956
01:12:29.26 --> 01:12:35.98
meet God.

957
01:12:35.98 --> 01:12:42.74
And now he's about to go and discuss where this comes from.

958
01:12:42.74 --> 01:12:43.74
Nevertheless, it is true.

959
01:12:43.74 --> 01:12:46.70
It isn't natural to be brave.

960
01:12:46.70 --> 01:12:54.78
How then have multitudes of man acquired this sudden act of courage?

961
01:12:54.78 --> 01:13:00.82
They have acquired it through discipline and training.

962
01:13:00.82 --> 01:13:07.78
When you have subjected yourself to discipline, you cease to think of yourself.

963
01:13:07.78 --> 01:13:12.90
You are not you, but part of a company of men.

964
01:13:12.90 --> 01:13:17.14
If you don't do your duty, you throw the whole machine out.

965
01:13:17.14 --> 01:13:22.30
You soon learn the hard lesson that every man's life and every man's service belongs to other

966
01:13:22.30 --> 01:13:24.66
people.

967
01:13:24.66 --> 01:13:31.26
If this, the organization of an army is a vivid illustration, take the infantry for instance.

968
01:13:31.26 --> 01:13:33.42
They can't fight by themselves.

969
01:13:33.42 --> 01:13:35.34
They're dependent on the support of the artillery.

970
01:13:35.34 --> 01:13:41.58
The artillery in turn would be terribly crippled or not for the gallantry of the air service.

971
01:13:41.58 --> 01:13:45.46
If the infantry collapse, the guns have to go back.

972
01:13:45.46 --> 01:13:48.30
If the infantry advance, the guns have to be pulled forward.

973
01:13:48.30 --> 01:13:52.90
This close interdependence of service on service division on division, battalion on

974
01:13:52.90 --> 01:13:59.78
battalion follows right down through the army till it reaches the individual.

975
01:13:59.78 --> 01:14:07.14
So that each man feels that the day will be lost if he fails.

976
01:14:07.14 --> 01:14:15.10
His imagination becomes intrigued by the immensity of the stakes for which he plays.

977
01:14:15.10 --> 01:14:22.14
Any physical calamity which may happen to himself becomes trifling when compared with

978
01:14:22.14 --> 01:14:33.66
the disgrace he would bring upon his regiment if he were not courageous.

979
01:14:33.66 --> 01:14:44.14
Now I'm about to read a piece that's, it's just a story he tells a story within a story.

980
01:14:44.14 --> 01:14:45.50
And we'll go right to it.

981
01:14:45.50 --> 01:14:51.46
A few months ago I was handling over a battery position in a fairly warm place.

982
01:14:51.46 --> 01:14:57.22
The major who came up to take over for me brought with him a subaltern and just enough

983
01:14:57.22 --> 01:14:59.22
men to run the guns.

984
01:14:59.22 --> 01:15:04.82
Within a half an hour of their arrival, a stray shell came in and caught the subaltern

985
01:15:04.82 --> 01:15:08.02
in five of the gun detachment.

986
01:15:08.02 --> 01:15:13.46
As plain at once that the subaltern was dying, his name must have been written on the

987
01:15:13.46 --> 01:15:16.66
shell as we say in France.

988
01:15:16.66 --> 01:15:24.54
We got a stretcher and made all haste to rush him out to a dressing station.

989
01:15:24.54 --> 01:15:27.94
Just as he was leaving, he asked to speak with his major.

990
01:15:27.94 --> 01:15:28.94
I'm sorry sir.

991
01:15:28.94 --> 01:15:30.46
I didn't mean to get wounded.

992
01:15:30.46 --> 01:15:32.98
He whispered.

993
01:15:32.98 --> 01:15:37.58
The last word he sent back from the dressing station where he died was tell the major I didn't

994
01:15:37.58 --> 01:15:41.70
mean to do it.

995
01:15:41.70 --> 01:15:42.70
That's the discipline.

996
01:15:42.70 --> 01:15:44.54
He didn't think of himself.

997
01:15:44.54 --> 01:15:53.42
All he thought of was that his major would be left short handed.

998
01:15:53.42 --> 01:16:05.06
He's about to tell another story that is, well I'm just going to read it.

999
01:16:05.06 --> 01:16:09.90
Last spring the night before an attack, a man was brought into battalion headquarters dug

1000
01:16:09.90 --> 01:16:14.34
out under arrest.

1001
01:16:14.34 --> 01:16:21.78
The colonel and the agitant were busy attending the last details of their preparations.

1002
01:16:21.78 --> 01:16:23.78
The agitant looked up irritably.

1003
01:16:23.78 --> 01:16:25.94
What is it?

1004
01:16:25.94 --> 01:16:32.98
The NCO of the guard answered, we found this man's sir in a communication trench.

1005
01:16:32.98 --> 01:16:35.98
His company has been in the front line for two hours.

1006
01:16:35.98 --> 01:16:40.78
He was sitting down with his equipment thrown away and evidently has no intention of

1007
01:16:40.78 --> 01:16:44.30
going up.

1008
01:16:44.30 --> 01:16:49.18
The agitant glanced coldly at the prisoner.

1009
01:16:49.18 --> 01:16:50.78
One of you to say for yourself.

1010
01:16:50.78 --> 01:16:52.46
So you understand this?

1011
01:16:52.46 --> 01:16:54.90
So they found this soldier.

1012
01:16:54.90 --> 01:16:58.90
He was his troops were up and fighting on the front line for two hours.

1013
01:16:58.90 --> 01:17:00.38
They find him.

1014
01:17:00.38 --> 01:17:04.26
He's got his radio strewn about and they say, are you going to go fight with your men?

1015
01:17:04.26 --> 01:17:06.78
And he says he's not going to go.

1016
01:17:06.78 --> 01:17:09.94
So the agitant glanced coldly at the prisoner.

1017
01:17:09.94 --> 01:17:12.62
What of you to say for yourself?

1018
01:17:12.62 --> 01:17:18.06
The man was ghastly white and shaking like an aspirin.

1019
01:17:18.06 --> 01:17:21.26
Sir, I'm not the man I was since I saw my best friend Jimmy.

1020
01:17:21.26 --> 01:17:25.18
We had his head blown off and lying in his hands.

1021
01:17:25.18 --> 01:17:27.18
It's kind of got me.

1022
01:17:27.18 --> 01:17:32.22
I can't face up to it.

1023
01:17:32.22 --> 01:17:36.70
The agitant was silent for a few seconds.

1024
01:17:36.70 --> 01:17:41.14
Then he said, you have a double choice.

1025
01:17:41.14 --> 01:17:48.34
I can either be shot up there doing your duty or behind the lines as a coward.

1026
01:17:48.34 --> 01:17:50.42
It's for you to choose.

1027
01:17:50.42 --> 01:17:55.02
I don't care.

1028
01:17:55.02 --> 01:17:57.54
The interview is ended.

1029
01:17:57.54 --> 01:17:59.90
He turned again to the Colonel.

1030
01:17:59.90 --> 01:18:09.86
The man slowly straightened himself, saluted like a soldier and marched out alone to the front.

1031
01:18:09.86 --> 01:18:22.18
That's what discipline does for a man who's going back on himself.

1032
01:18:22.18 --> 01:18:27.58
Like I said, I'm not even sure how I feel about that story.

1033
01:18:27.58 --> 01:18:30.38
I actually don't know.

1034
01:18:30.38 --> 01:18:32.78
You got a guy in the hack where he talks about this dick.

1035
01:18:32.78 --> 01:18:33.78
Winners talked about this.

1036
01:18:33.78 --> 01:18:37.30
Where you get guys that they're broken.

1037
01:18:37.30 --> 01:18:41.94
You've got to give him a break.

1038
01:18:41.94 --> 01:18:45.18
What had this guy been through God only knows.

1039
01:18:45.18 --> 01:18:46.90
Obviously, he saw his friend get killed.

1040
01:18:46.90 --> 01:18:51.38
I'm sure he was near death over and over again.

1041
01:18:51.38 --> 01:18:56.06
The Colonel just says, you either get out there and die.

1042
01:18:56.06 --> 01:19:00.90
You die back here as a coward.

1043
01:19:00.90 --> 01:19:15.86
There's like a part of me that is filled with admiration.

1044
01:19:15.86 --> 01:19:22.02
The guy obviously overcomes his fears and there's also a part of me that's filled with horror

1045
01:19:22.02 --> 01:19:27.34
because he overcomes his fears.

1046
01:19:27.34 --> 01:19:40.86
To give that final order and for the soldier to give that final salute, it's just all

1047
01:19:40.86 --> 01:19:47.42
of it, the bravery and at the same time, the cowlessness and at the same time, the fear

1048
01:19:47.42 --> 01:20:02.30
and the dedication to duty and yet it's dedication to madness.

1049
01:20:02.30 --> 01:20:10.70
And again, it's a window into human nature.

1050
01:20:10.70 --> 01:20:17.78
And what people go through and what people will do and won't do and what it takes to get

1051
01:20:17.78 --> 01:20:26.62
him there.

1052
01:20:26.62 --> 01:20:28.82
Back to the book.

1053
01:20:28.82 --> 01:20:35.66
One of the big influences that helps keep a soldier's soul sanitary is what's known in the

1054
01:20:35.66 --> 01:20:40.66
British Army as spit and polish.

1055
01:20:40.66 --> 01:20:45.74
Basically we pull out for a rest we start to working, burnishing and washing.

1056
01:20:45.74 --> 01:20:50.34
The chaps may have shown the most brilliant courage and self-sacrificing endurance it

1057
01:20:50.34 --> 01:20:53.86
counts for nothing if they're untidy.

1058
01:20:53.86 --> 01:20:59.30
The first morning no matter what are the weather conditions we hold an inspection.

1059
01:20:59.30 --> 01:21:06.26
Every man has to show up with his chin-shaped hair cut, leather polished and button shining.

1060
01:21:06.26 --> 01:21:12.14
If he doesn't, he gets hell.

1061
01:21:12.14 --> 01:21:17.82
So I mean clearly we've talked about this since day one, the discipline and maintaining

1062
01:21:17.82 --> 01:21:18.82
the discipline.

1063
01:21:18.82 --> 01:21:21.82
And here these guys coming off the front lines from the trenches.

1064
01:21:21.82 --> 01:21:25.22
All right cool tomorrow morning we're having inspections of get your deer together

1065
01:21:25.22 --> 01:21:28.98
and polish your boots.

1066
01:21:28.98 --> 01:21:30.34
Back to the book, there's a lot in it.

1067
01:21:30.34 --> 01:21:35.66
You bring a man out from a tight corner where he's been an hourly contact with death.

1068
01:21:35.66 --> 01:21:38.62
He's apt to think what's the use in taking pride of myself.

1069
01:21:38.62 --> 01:21:42.26
I'm likely to be done in any day.

1070
01:21:42.26 --> 01:21:45.18
It'll all be the same if I'm dead.

1071
01:21:45.18 --> 01:21:51.90
But if he doesn't keep clean in his body he won't keep clean in his mind.

1072
01:21:51.90 --> 01:21:57.10
The man who has his button shining brightly in his leather polished is usually the man who

1073
01:21:57.10 --> 01:22:01.18
is brightly polished on the inside.

1074
01:22:01.18 --> 01:22:05.74
And polish teaches a man to come out of the trenches from seeing his palettes killed and

1075
01:22:05.74 --> 01:22:10.50
carry on as though nothing abnormal had happened.

1076
01:22:10.50 --> 01:22:18.02
It educates him in an impersonal attitude towards calamity which makes it bearable.

1077
01:22:18.02 --> 01:22:23.50
It forces him not to regard anything too tragically.

1078
01:22:23.50 --> 01:22:29.82
If you can stand aside from yourself and poke fun at your own tragedy, and tragedy always

1079
01:22:29.82 --> 01:22:32.66
has its humors aspects.

1080
01:22:32.66 --> 01:22:37.26
That helps.

1081
01:22:37.26 --> 01:22:40.46
We were sometimes we were in the som for several months.

1082
01:22:40.46 --> 01:22:43.30
The mud was up to our knees almost all the time.

1083
01:22:43.30 --> 01:22:46.10
We were perishingly cold and very rarely dry.

1084
01:22:46.10 --> 01:22:47.66
There was no natural cover.

1085
01:22:47.66 --> 01:22:51.82
When we went up forward to observe we would stand in water to our knees for 24 hours

1086
01:22:51.82 --> 01:22:54.22
rather than going to the dugouts.

1087
01:22:54.22 --> 01:22:58.46
They were so filled with vermin and batten flies.

1088
01:22:58.46 --> 01:23:02.42
Even if we were wounded and strayed man often drowned on their buck journey back from

1089
01:23:02.42 --> 01:23:06.90
the front line, many of the dead never got buried lives couldn't be rescued in carrying

1090
01:23:06.90 --> 01:23:08.70
them out.

1091
01:23:08.70 --> 01:23:14.38
We were so weary that the sight of those who rested forever only stirred in us a quiet

1092
01:23:14.38 --> 01:23:17.38
envy.

1093
01:23:17.38 --> 01:23:20.34
Our emotions were too exhausted for hatred.

1094
01:23:20.34 --> 01:23:26.10
They usually are unless some new hunishness had roused them.

1095
01:23:26.10 --> 01:23:31.50
When we were having a bad time, we'd glance across no man's land and say poor old fritzy,

1096
01:23:31.50 --> 01:23:34.26
he's getting the worst of it.

1097
01:23:34.26 --> 01:23:39.06
That thought helps.

1098
01:23:39.06 --> 01:23:44.38
This is a piece where he talks about when somebody's not holding the line, when somebody's

1099
01:23:44.38 --> 01:23:47.50
a quitter.

1100
01:23:47.50 --> 01:23:52.54
When you come to consider it, a quitter is always a selfish man.

1101
01:23:52.54 --> 01:23:57.58
A selfishness that makes a man a coward or a deserter, if he's in a dangerous place and runs

1102
01:23:57.58 --> 01:24:06.70
away, all he's doing is thinking of himself.

1103
01:24:06.70 --> 01:24:12.78
He goes on to say, here, I've been supposed to have been talking about God as we see him.

1104
01:24:12.78 --> 01:24:14.78
I don't know whether I have.

1105
01:24:14.78 --> 01:24:18.90
As a matter of fact, if you ask me when I was out there, whether there was any religion

1106
01:24:18.90 --> 01:24:24.90
in the trenches, I should have replied certainly not.

1107
01:24:24.90 --> 01:24:29.38
Now that I've been out of the fighting for a while, I see that there is religion there,

1108
01:24:29.38 --> 01:24:34.90
a religion which will dominate the world when the war has ended, the religion of heroism.

1109
01:24:34.90 --> 01:24:39.86
It's a religion in which men don't pray much.

1110
01:24:39.86 --> 01:24:44.42
With me before I went to the front, prayer was a habit.

1111
01:24:44.42 --> 01:24:47.62
Out there, I lost the habit.

1112
01:24:47.62 --> 01:24:52.06
Not one was doing seemed sufficient.

1113
01:24:52.06 --> 01:24:57.58
I got the feeling that I might be meeting God at any moment, so I didn't need to be worrying

1114
01:24:57.58 --> 01:25:04.46
him all the time, hanging on to spiritual telephone and feeling slidied if he didn't answer

1115
01:25:04.46 --> 01:25:08.02
me directly when I rang him up.

1116
01:25:08.02 --> 01:25:12.26
If God was really interested in me, he didn't need constant reminding.

1117
01:25:12.26 --> 01:25:20.42
When he had a world to manage, it seemed best not to interrupt him with fearless petitions,

1118
01:25:20.42 --> 01:25:25.62
but to put my prayers into my work.

1119
01:25:25.62 --> 01:25:29.62
That's how we all feel out there.

1120
01:25:29.62 --> 01:25:35.46
I've learnt discipline and my own total unimportant.

1121
01:25:35.46 --> 01:25:41.46
In the army discipline gets possession of your soul, you learn to suppress yourself

1122
01:25:41.46 --> 01:25:45.86
to obey implicitly to think of others before yourself.

1123
01:25:45.86 --> 01:25:51.30
You learn to jump at an order to forsake your own convenience at any hour of the day or

1124
01:25:51.30 --> 01:25:57.86
night to go forward on the most lonely and dangerous errands without complaining.

1125
01:25:57.86 --> 01:26:03.62
You learn to feel that there is only one thing that counts in life and only one thing

1126
01:26:03.62 --> 01:26:05.54
you can make out of it.

1127
01:26:05.54 --> 01:26:12.10
The spirit you have developed in encountering difficulties.

1128
01:26:12.10 --> 01:26:14.58
Your body is nothing.

1129
01:26:14.58 --> 01:26:19.30
It can be smashed in a minute how frail it is you never realize until you've seen men

1130
01:26:19.30 --> 01:26:27.26
smashed, so you learn to tolerate the body, to despise death and to place all your alliance

1131
01:26:27.26 --> 01:26:29.70
on courage.

1132
01:26:29.70 --> 01:26:47.06
Which when is found at its best is the power to endure for the sake of others.

1133
01:26:47.06 --> 01:26:54.42
It is closing out here.

1134
01:26:54.42 --> 01:27:02.26
The religion of the trenches is not a religion which analyzes God with in-pertoned speculation.

1135
01:27:02.26 --> 01:27:09.42
So in this religion the trenches God is not standing in some kind of a foritary judgment.

1136
01:27:09.42 --> 01:27:14.22
It isn't a religion which takes up much of his time.

1137
01:27:14.22 --> 01:27:21.38
It's a religion which teaches men to carry on stoutly and to say, I've tried to do my bit

1138
01:27:21.38 --> 01:27:27.46
as best I know how.

1139
01:27:27.46 --> 01:27:31.90
That's the simple religion of the trenches as I have learned it.

1140
01:27:31.90 --> 01:27:35.78
A religion not without glory.

1141
01:27:35.78 --> 01:27:46.10
To carry on as bravely as you know how and to trust God without worrying him.

1142
01:27:46.10 --> 01:27:54.90
And the last line I'll read from the glory of the trenches, Dawson says, it's funny.

1143
01:27:54.90 --> 01:28:03.22
You go away to the most damnable undertaking ever invented.

1144
01:28:03.22 --> 01:28:16.06
And you come back cleaner in spirit.

1145
01:28:16.06 --> 01:28:24.82
And again I will tell you that from my perspective and from what I've been through

1146
01:28:24.82 --> 01:28:31.42
which by the way, I want to say that what I've been through in my military career is absolutely

1147
01:28:31.42 --> 01:28:33.62
nothing.

1148
01:28:33.62 --> 01:28:39.18
Nothing compared to what a soldier in the world were one lived through.

1149
01:28:39.18 --> 01:28:41.66
But what I did go through, I will say this.

1150
01:28:41.66 --> 01:28:53.42
I don't think war took anything away from me or impacted me in a negative way.

1151
01:28:53.42 --> 01:28:59.66
I think war made me better.

1152
01:28:59.66 --> 01:29:06.78
I think war made me a better man, a better person.

1153
01:29:06.78 --> 01:29:10.50
And in the words of Dawson,

1154
01:29:10.50 --> 01:29:19.30
I think it absolutely cleaned my spirit.

1155
01:29:19.30 --> 01:29:26.10
And I am thankful for that.

1156
01:29:26.10 --> 01:29:34.94
And I guess that the question becomes how can we clean our spirits without war?

1157
01:29:34.94 --> 01:29:35.94
How can we do that?

1158
01:29:35.94 --> 01:29:43.06
And I think the answer again, and this is something that I don't think is that it comes

1159
01:29:43.06 --> 01:29:44.06
from discipline.

1160
01:29:44.06 --> 01:29:46.10
And that's what I talk about all the time.

1161
01:29:46.10 --> 01:29:51.94
It's about setting aside comfort, setting aside weakness, setting aside fear, and having

1162
01:29:51.94 --> 01:29:56.94
the discipline to endure.

1163
01:29:56.94 --> 01:30:10.78
And the challenges in the hardship and the pain in order to become better.

1164
01:30:10.78 --> 01:30:28.90
To suffer the glory of the discipline, to become stronger and faster and smarter and better.

1165
01:30:28.90 --> 01:30:40.74
And now from a leadership perspective is to then put others before yourself.

1166
01:30:40.74 --> 01:30:48.82
The try and do some good in the world for others to lead them down the right path, not

1167
01:30:48.82 --> 01:30:52.70
for you.

1168
01:30:52.70 --> 01:30:57.06
But for them.

1169
01:30:57.06 --> 01:31:05.38
And while war certainly taught me those things and ingrained those things into my mind

1170
01:31:05.38 --> 01:31:10.58
if they weren't already there, I don't think you need to go to war.

1171
01:31:10.58 --> 01:31:20.10
But I do think that you have to discipline yourself.

1172
01:31:20.10 --> 01:31:24.54
You have to get outside your comfort zone and you have to push yourself beyond what you

1173
01:31:24.54 --> 01:31:27.70
thought you could ever do.

1174
01:31:27.70 --> 01:31:57.06
To get that glimpse of the truth and to get that glimpse of the glory in the trenches.

1175
01:31:57.06 --> 01:32:11.82
And again, thanks to Jesse for sending me this book, Outstanding Old Copy Printed in 1918.

1176
01:32:11.82 --> 01:32:18.94
I actually typed it all out so I didn't have to mess up this beautiful book.

1177
01:32:18.94 --> 01:32:20.78
I learned a lot from it.

1178
01:32:20.78 --> 01:32:23.42
So I appreciate it.

1179
01:32:23.42 --> 01:32:28.86
And echo Charles.

1180
01:32:28.86 --> 01:32:33.50
Save me and talk.

1181
01:32:33.50 --> 01:32:37.14
Talk about something more like for instance.

1182
01:32:37.14 --> 01:32:42.58
But like for instance, people just listen to this and maybe they want to listen to more

1183
01:32:42.58 --> 01:32:43.58
of it.

1184
01:32:43.58 --> 01:32:46.14
How could they help that occur in the world?

1185
01:32:46.14 --> 01:32:48.54
Move that process along.

1186
01:32:48.54 --> 01:32:53.06
We could just talk about Jockel White T for like 10 minutes.

1187
01:32:53.06 --> 01:32:54.30
We could definitely talk about Jockel White T.

1188
01:32:54.30 --> 01:32:57.30
I wasn't really that into, actually I was.

1189
01:32:57.30 --> 01:32:59.10
I'm into T every once in a while.

1190
01:32:59.10 --> 01:33:03.06
I can hear you say a lot of the T from the offices now missing.

1191
01:33:03.06 --> 01:33:07.06
But you know how like you're like, you know, it's a mellow night.

1192
01:33:07.06 --> 01:33:10.34
I should just call it and go to bed or something.

1193
01:33:10.34 --> 01:33:13.74
Then I'd make like, you know what's the mellow one?

1194
01:33:13.74 --> 01:33:14.74
Can't remember.

1195
01:33:14.74 --> 01:33:15.74
Whatever.

1196
01:33:15.74 --> 01:33:18.26
Yeah, I'm not into T like I said.

1197
01:33:18.26 --> 01:33:21.58
So I was like, all right, well hey, you know, Jockel T.

1198
01:33:21.58 --> 01:33:23.22
It's cool.

1199
01:33:23.22 --> 01:33:24.22
I'm cool.

1200
01:33:24.22 --> 01:33:25.22
Yeah.

1201
01:33:25.22 --> 01:33:26.22
How's that working out?

1202
01:33:26.22 --> 01:33:27.22
It's not going to say.

1203
01:33:27.22 --> 01:33:29.62
No, it's like a random Saturday.

1204
01:33:29.62 --> 01:33:34.70
And I was like, I'm going to do like how you do put it on ice and see if I can't get my

1205
01:33:34.70 --> 01:33:37.42
refresh on, you know, outside it, whatever.

1206
01:33:37.42 --> 01:33:39.70
And so I put it in.

1207
01:33:39.70 --> 01:33:40.90
I put in this tin collo.

1208
01:33:40.90 --> 01:33:41.90
Nice man.

1209
01:33:41.90 --> 01:33:44.70
I was like, oh, I think I might be into T a little bit.

1210
01:33:44.70 --> 01:33:45.70
Sarah comes out.

1211
01:33:45.70 --> 01:33:46.70
She has hers too.

1212
01:33:46.70 --> 01:33:47.70
It was nice.

1213
01:33:47.70 --> 01:33:48.70
It was cool man.

1214
01:33:48.70 --> 01:33:51.30
We are going through it very quickly because they're, well, I hope I am

1215
01:33:51.30 --> 01:33:52.30
always getting after it right now.

1216
01:33:52.30 --> 01:33:55.86
This is my younger kids.

1217
01:33:55.86 --> 01:33:57.86
But yeah, and you know what's awesome?

1218
01:33:57.86 --> 01:34:04.34
I don't know if you've gone to Amazon.com and read the reviews that people are writing.

1219
01:34:04.34 --> 01:34:09.42
I'm actually going to have to bring out some of those and read them because they're awesome.

1220
01:34:09.42 --> 01:34:12.62
They're funny as hell and they're great.

1221
01:34:12.62 --> 01:34:18.18
So everyone that's writing reviews for Jockel T, Jockel White T, I appreciate it.

1222
01:34:18.18 --> 01:34:19.18
It's awesome.

1223
01:34:19.18 --> 01:34:25.10
Got a lot of good feedback as well about, you know, everyone likes it tastes great.

1224
01:34:25.10 --> 01:34:27.82
And it makes you feel real good.

1225
01:34:27.82 --> 01:34:32.92
It makes you feel, it's a little glory, a little glory in a cup, little glory in a

1226
01:34:32.92 --> 01:34:33.92
iced tea.

1227
01:34:33.92 --> 01:34:36.94
So I was looking over like the instructions.

1228
01:34:36.94 --> 01:34:41.26
So let me just in case you don't read the instructions, I think they're pretty straightforward.

1229
01:34:41.26 --> 01:34:43.06
I think you've ever had tea.

1230
01:34:43.06 --> 01:34:44.06
Yeah.

1231
01:34:44.06 --> 01:34:45.06
People know.

1232
01:34:45.06 --> 01:34:48.62
But if you took the time to read the instructions, this is what you would read.

1233
01:34:48.62 --> 01:34:49.62
So you can read the instructions.

1234
01:34:49.62 --> 01:34:54.46
Boyle eight out of the water, pour water over one bag of Jockel White T, proof for three

1235
01:34:54.46 --> 01:34:55.86
to five minutes.

1236
01:34:55.86 --> 01:35:00.26
Enjoy over or enjoy hot or over ice.

1237
01:35:00.26 --> 01:35:01.26
Get after it.

1238
01:35:01.26 --> 01:35:05.66
So get after it is part of the instructions.

1239
01:35:05.66 --> 01:35:08.86
In what's funny is people are, it's real.

1240
01:35:08.86 --> 01:35:13.62
Like you really, you really have to get after it when you're done.

1241
01:35:13.62 --> 01:35:17.14
And so that's what the funny is people are saying.

1242
01:35:17.14 --> 01:35:18.14
It's real.

1243
01:35:18.14 --> 01:35:19.14
It's real.

1244
01:35:19.14 --> 01:35:21.14
There's real stuff in there.

1245
01:35:21.14 --> 01:35:24.80
And when you get it in your brain, you'll be like, oh, I'm going to go knock out some

1246
01:35:24.80 --> 01:35:25.80
projects.

1247
01:35:25.80 --> 01:35:26.80
Maybe do a little MacCon.

1248
01:35:26.80 --> 01:35:27.80
Maybe go on the Mac.

1249
01:35:27.80 --> 01:35:28.80
Whatever.

1250
01:35:28.80 --> 01:35:29.80
You know, it's just good.

1251
01:35:29.80 --> 01:35:32.20
Or am I just cruise by the pool?

1252
01:35:32.20 --> 01:35:34.20
No, we don't do that.

1253
01:35:34.20 --> 01:35:35.20
That's not getting out of it.

1254
01:35:35.20 --> 01:35:37.20
That makes one of us.

1255
01:35:37.20 --> 01:35:39.000
I was getting after it in the pool.

1256
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
How about that?

1257
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I guess I year approved.

1258
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.60
Yeah, not it's good man.

1259
01:35:42.60 --> 01:35:48.12
Like I said, it may be even more into tea because it's like, you know, it's like

1260
01:35:48.12 --> 01:35:50.66
you get into, well, I did.

1261
01:35:50.66 --> 01:35:52.46
I'm not going to say, this is what happens.

1262
01:35:52.46 --> 01:35:54.54
But I'm saying, you're like, okay, I like this tea.

1263
01:35:54.54 --> 01:35:56.14
I like the brand, you know?

1264
01:35:56.14 --> 01:35:59.64
So you're, and then you appreciate the experience when it goes down.

1265
01:35:59.64 --> 01:36:01.10
You know, you're more familiar with it now.

1266
01:36:01.10 --> 01:36:02.34
Now I want to see people drinking tea.

1267
01:36:02.34 --> 01:36:03.34
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

1268
01:36:03.34 --> 01:36:07.54
And some people been like, whoa, some people emailed and said, whoa, is it really

1269
01:36:07.54 --> 01:36:09.14
like, jocquo, you made this tea?

1270
01:36:09.14 --> 01:36:10.14
I'm really.

1271
01:36:10.14 --> 01:36:11.14
Yeah, yeah.

1272
01:36:11.14 --> 01:36:13.34
I went through, it took like, it took a few months to make.

1273
01:36:13.34 --> 01:36:16.10
Cause I kind of, I'd send back, oh, no, make it a little bit more this.

1274
01:36:16.10 --> 01:36:17.10
A little bit less of that.

1275
01:36:17.10 --> 01:36:23.02
And eventually, when I got the, the right combination thing, then it was okay.

1276
01:36:23.02 --> 01:36:25.74
And, well, they're like, okay, well, for marketing, what do you want to do?

1277
01:36:25.74 --> 01:36:27.62
And I go, oh, it's, oh, here's the marketing.

1278
01:36:27.62 --> 01:36:29.30
I'm, I'm Mr. Marketing over here.

1279
01:36:29.30 --> 01:36:31.10
Put it in a black box.

1280
01:36:31.10 --> 01:36:32.62
Oh, what should we call it?

1281
01:36:32.62 --> 01:36:34.26
Oh, I think of a good original title.

1282
01:36:34.26 --> 01:36:35.26
Jocquo tea.

1283
01:36:35.26 --> 01:36:36.26
How's that?

1284
01:36:36.26 --> 01:36:37.50
Okay, so we got Jocquo tea.

1285
01:36:37.50 --> 01:36:38.50
Good.

1286
01:36:38.50 --> 01:36:39.50
There it is.

1287
01:36:39.50 --> 01:36:41.10
And that's my marketing strategy.

1288
01:36:41.10 --> 01:36:44.10
Hey, hey.

1289
01:36:44.10 --> 01:36:45.10
Yeah, man.

1290
01:36:45.10 --> 01:36:46.10
No, I like it.

1291
01:36:46.10 --> 01:36:50.10
I actually did a very high-ranking company to come in and do an assessment of our customers.

1292
01:36:50.10 --> 01:36:51.10
Guess what?

1293
01:36:51.10 --> 01:36:53.82
Our customers are out to kick ass.

1294
01:36:53.82 --> 01:36:55.98
They don't want all this crap.

1295
01:36:55.98 --> 01:36:59.26
They want something that's going to make them crush the world.

1296
01:36:59.26 --> 01:37:00.26
Yeah.

1297
01:37:00.26 --> 01:37:01.26
So, there you go.

1298
01:37:01.26 --> 01:37:05.06
We don't need to put any, you know, images of whatever on it.

1299
01:37:05.06 --> 01:37:10.02
Yeah, doing some kind of demographic studies on what can interest and, you know, who's

1300
01:37:10.02 --> 01:37:11.66
the target market, the target market?

1301
01:37:11.66 --> 01:37:12.66
I don't care.

1302
01:37:12.66 --> 01:37:14.78
I know the target market is.

1303
01:37:14.78 --> 01:37:17.98
The target market is my people out there that are getting after it.

1304
01:37:17.98 --> 01:37:18.98
There's the target market.

1305
01:37:18.98 --> 01:37:19.98
You know, there you go.

1306
01:37:19.98 --> 01:37:20.98
I just hope I can get it.

1307
01:37:20.98 --> 01:37:25.54
I just thought I hope this doesn't fall into the wrong ants.

1308
01:37:25.54 --> 01:37:30.70
What if criminal, criminally-minded people or people that are, you know, have evil thoughts?

1309
01:37:30.70 --> 01:37:32.42
Maybe they start drinking white tea.

1310
01:37:32.42 --> 01:37:33.42
We might be in trouble.

1311
01:37:33.42 --> 01:37:34.42
Yeah.

1312
01:37:34.42 --> 01:37:36.82
We might have to bolster up and drink more white tea.

1313
01:37:36.82 --> 01:37:40.90
Yeah, or they could switch over to the old discipline equals freedom, kind of situation.

1314
01:37:40.90 --> 01:37:43.90
And, you know, I'm just saying, theoretically, that could be something.

1315
01:37:43.90 --> 01:37:44.74
Yeah.

1316
01:37:44.74 --> 01:37:45.74
They're good.

1317
01:37:45.74 --> 01:37:46.74
This is good, man.

1318
01:37:46.74 --> 01:37:47.74
It looks good.

1319
01:37:47.74 --> 01:37:48.74
Yep.

1320
01:37:48.74 --> 01:37:49.74
Pretty good.

1321
01:37:49.74 --> 01:37:50.74
Pretty good.

1322
01:37:50.74 --> 01:37:51.74
All right.

1323
01:37:51.74 --> 01:37:52.74
Cool.

1324
01:37:52.74 --> 01:37:53.74
Jocco-white tea.

1325
01:37:53.74 --> 01:37:54.74
You know what?

1326
01:37:54.74 --> 01:37:54.74
On Amazon.com.

1327
01:37:54.74 --> 01:37:56.74
After you click through, click through.

1328
01:37:56.74 --> 01:37:57.74
Yeah.

1329
01:37:57.74 --> 01:38:00.74
Which, you know, there's a whole tail behind the click through right now.

1330
01:38:00.74 --> 01:38:01.74
Yeah.

1331
01:38:01.74 --> 01:38:02.74
Yeah.

1332
01:38:02.74 --> 01:38:05.94
It's kind of, and we have to make sure, because that's one of the main ways to support

1333
01:38:05.94 --> 01:38:08.14
the podcast, is to click through.

1334
01:38:08.14 --> 01:38:12.90
But if in the past you saved, first of all, if you had the true, the true, the true

1335
01:38:12.90 --> 01:38:14.90
is no-in-void.

1336
01:38:14.90 --> 01:38:15.90
We got shut down by Amazon.

1337
01:38:15.90 --> 01:38:17.90
It was, let's just say they didn't really like it that much.

1338
01:38:17.90 --> 01:38:21.66
They didn't like that much, because I've been proven wrong in the world.

1339
01:38:21.66 --> 01:38:23.34
This is one of the times I've been wrong.

1340
01:38:23.34 --> 01:38:25.90
There is such a thing as getting after it too much.

1341
01:38:25.90 --> 01:38:26.90
Yeah.

1342
01:38:26.90 --> 01:38:27.90
And apparently we were getting after it.

1343
01:38:27.90 --> 01:38:30.70
Troopers were getting after it too much with the true, but tool.

1344
01:38:30.70 --> 01:38:32.30
So they shut down the true, but tool.

1345
01:38:32.30 --> 01:38:33.30
Okay.

1346
01:38:33.30 --> 01:38:35.10
So if you're still having the true, I don't know if it's still work.

1347
01:38:35.10 --> 01:38:37.02
But if you're still having it, you think you're using it.

1348
01:38:37.02 --> 01:38:39.30
You're not supporting the podcast.

1349
01:38:39.30 --> 01:38:40.30
So what you have to do.

1350
01:38:40.30 --> 01:38:47.42
And also if you have your old link saved that would click you into Amazon.

1351
01:38:47.42 --> 01:38:48.42
And you thought, oh, I just used this.

1352
01:38:48.42 --> 01:38:50.38
And I'll just save the, what's that called a favorite?

1353
01:38:50.38 --> 01:38:51.38
If you made it a favorite part of it.

1354
01:38:51.38 --> 01:38:56.18
Before, if you bookmarked it, then you got to erase that bookmark.

1355
01:38:56.18 --> 01:39:00.54
You got to go back to jockelpodcast.com or back to jockelstore.com.

1356
01:39:00.54 --> 01:39:05.50
And you've got to make a new bookmark that has the new click through the Amazon.

1357
01:39:05.50 --> 01:39:09.30
So we can get Amazon back in the game supporting the podcast.

1358
01:39:09.30 --> 01:39:11.10
So again, it's not costing you anything.

1359
01:39:11.10 --> 01:39:14.06
All it's going to cost you is that short period of time to click through.

1360
01:39:14.06 --> 01:39:15.54
And that way we can support the podcast.

1361
01:39:15.54 --> 01:39:19.02
That way we can buy more knives for the table.

1362
01:39:19.02 --> 01:39:20.02
Yep.

1363
01:39:20.02 --> 01:39:21.66
And that's what we're looking to do.

1364
01:39:21.66 --> 01:39:22.66
Yeah.

1365
01:39:22.66 --> 01:39:23.50
And Amazon's not mad at us.

1366
01:39:23.50 --> 01:39:25.66
They were just like, hey, the true, true, true, true.

1367
01:39:25.66 --> 01:39:26.66
Too heavy.

1368
01:39:26.66 --> 01:39:27.66
It's too heavy.

1369
01:39:27.66 --> 01:39:28.66
Mm-hmm.

1370
01:39:28.66 --> 01:39:32.54
It's like when, what was that book we just did where the Germans were mad.

1371
01:39:32.54 --> 01:39:34.86
The Americans were getting after too much.

1372
01:39:34.86 --> 01:39:35.86
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1373
01:39:35.86 --> 01:39:36.86
This is unethical.

1374
01:39:36.86 --> 01:39:42.58
Like theoretically from Amazon's perspective, like the Nazis, they thought, man,

1375
01:39:42.58 --> 01:39:43.98
these guys are getting after this.

1376
01:39:43.98 --> 01:39:44.98
Too much.

1377
01:39:44.98 --> 01:39:46.82
This true, true, true thing is, we must arrest.

1378
01:39:46.82 --> 01:39:58.06
So there's no more true bookmark from from jockelpodcast.com or from the jockelstore.com.

1379
01:39:58.06 --> 01:39:59.06
All right.

1380
01:39:59.06 --> 01:40:00.06
So that's good.

1381
01:40:00.06 --> 01:40:02.70
That was a really good analogy right there by the way.

1382
01:40:02.70 --> 01:40:03.70
The Nazis.

1383
01:40:03.70 --> 01:40:04.70
Yeah.

1384
01:40:04.70 --> 01:40:05.70
It's good.

1385
01:40:05.70 --> 01:40:06.70
I'm not trying to say,

1386
01:40:06.70 --> 01:40:08.98
it was fascist in what Amazon did.

1387
01:40:08.98 --> 01:40:10.30
No, because it wasn't.

1388
01:40:10.30 --> 01:40:11.30
You know what?

1389
01:40:11.30 --> 01:40:14.22
It's a great, it actually really is truly a great program.

1390
01:40:14.22 --> 01:40:14.58
Yeah.

1391
01:40:14.58 --> 01:40:15.58
It really is a great program.

1392
01:40:15.58 --> 01:40:17.62
It's very supportive of us.

1393
01:40:17.62 --> 01:40:20.30
And it's cool for Amazon because people are ordering stuff through Amazon.

1394
01:40:20.30 --> 01:40:25.46
I love it by and stuff and doing it through our website makes me feel good.

1395
01:40:25.46 --> 01:40:28.62
It's like another excuse to just buy more books.

1396
01:40:28.62 --> 01:40:30.94
I'm buying books at a ridiculous rate right now.

1397
01:40:30.94 --> 01:40:32.94
It's actually, it's almost embarrassing.

1398
01:40:32.94 --> 01:40:34.34
How many books I'm buying right now?

1399
01:40:34.34 --> 01:40:36.38
Because everybody recommends me a book.

1400
01:40:36.38 --> 01:40:38.06
And I used to say, well, maybe I'll take a look at it.

1401
01:40:38.06 --> 01:40:38.90
I don't have time to do that anymore.

1402
01:40:38.90 --> 01:40:39.90
Now I just order it.

1403
01:40:39.90 --> 01:40:41.18
Just bring it to me.

1404
01:40:41.18 --> 01:40:41.90
Amazon.

1405
01:40:41.90 --> 01:40:42.90
I want it today.

1406
01:40:42.90 --> 01:40:43.90
Yeah.

1407
01:40:43.90 --> 01:40:44.90
Yeah.

1408
01:40:44.90 --> 01:40:45.90
How cool is that?

1409
01:40:45.90 --> 01:40:46.90
Yeah.

1410
01:40:46.90 --> 01:40:47.90
Amazon Prime.

1411
01:40:47.90 --> 01:40:48.90
Same day delivery.

1412
01:40:48.90 --> 01:40:49.90
Bring me my books.

1413
01:40:49.90 --> 01:40:50.90
Yeah.

1414
01:40:50.90 --> 01:40:51.90
You know what else is cool?

1415
01:40:51.90 --> 01:40:56.14
So I was going to mark up the book, the glory of the trenches.

1416
01:40:56.14 --> 01:40:59.14
But I didn't want to mark it up obviously because it's an old beautiful copy.

1417
01:40:59.14 --> 01:41:00.94
So I bought a new one.

1418
01:41:00.94 --> 01:41:01.94
Okay.

1419
01:41:01.94 --> 01:41:06.18
Now when you buy these certain books from Amazon,

1420
01:41:06.18 --> 01:41:08.26
they print them immediately.

1421
01:41:08.26 --> 01:41:09.26
All right.

1422
01:41:09.26 --> 01:41:13.14
So this book has got printed on the 22nd of September for me.

1423
01:41:13.14 --> 01:41:13.98
And then I just ordered it.

1424
01:41:13.98 --> 01:41:15.58
So I could mark this one up.

1425
01:41:15.58 --> 01:41:16.58
Yeah.

1426
01:41:16.58 --> 01:41:17.94
It didn't arrive before I went on my trip.

1427
01:41:17.94 --> 01:41:20.10
So I did it on another copy.

1428
01:41:20.10 --> 01:41:21.10
So anyways.

1429
01:41:21.10 --> 01:41:22.10
Yeah.

1430
01:41:22.10 --> 01:41:25.58
They will print a lot of these books that we're bringing out, that are rare books, that

1431
01:41:25.58 --> 01:41:26.98
are old books, that are out of print books.

1432
01:41:26.98 --> 01:41:27.98
They just reprint them.

1433
01:41:27.98 --> 01:41:28.98
Yeah.

1434
01:41:28.98 --> 01:41:30.38
So you can get a book printed.

1435
01:41:30.38 --> 01:41:34.98
They'll bring the ones out here on the West Coast are printed in San Bernardino, California,

1436
01:41:34.98 --> 01:41:35.98
San Bernardino.

1437
01:41:35.98 --> 01:41:36.98
There you go.

1438
01:41:36.98 --> 01:41:37.98
And what?

1439
01:41:37.98 --> 01:41:38.98
You order it.

1440
01:41:38.98 --> 01:41:39.98
They drive it down that day.

1441
01:41:39.98 --> 01:41:40.98
Oh, yeah.

1442
01:41:40.98 --> 01:41:41.98
I don't know what, man.

1443
01:41:41.98 --> 01:41:42.98
I don't know.

1444
01:41:42.98 --> 01:41:43.98
It's awesome.

1445
01:41:43.98 --> 01:41:44.98
Yeah.

1446
01:41:44.98 --> 01:41:45.98
Cool.

1447
01:41:45.98 --> 01:41:46.98
But yeah.

1448
01:41:46.98 --> 01:41:48.98
If you want to support this podcast in that way.

1449
01:41:48.98 --> 01:41:49.98
Which is a great way.

1450
01:41:49.98 --> 01:41:51.98
And we really appreciate it.

1451
01:41:51.98 --> 01:41:52.98
That's awesome stuff.

1452
01:41:52.98 --> 01:41:55.98
It definitely helps us do what we do.

1453
01:41:55.98 --> 01:41:56.98
Yeah.

1454
01:41:56.98 --> 01:41:57.98
Yeah.

1455
01:41:57.98 --> 01:41:58.98
Thanks.

1456
01:41:58.98 --> 01:41:59.98
But yeah.

1457
01:41:59.98 --> 01:42:02.98
It's on jockelstore.com and jockelpikets.com.

1458
01:42:02.98 --> 01:42:04.98
Click through.

1459
01:42:04.98 --> 01:42:07.98
What other ways can people support this podcast?

1460
01:42:07.98 --> 01:42:14.98
Well, obviously, the obvious way is subscribe to it on iTunes.

1461
01:42:14.98 --> 01:42:15.98
Right?

1462
01:42:15.98 --> 01:42:16.98
If you haven't already.

1463
01:42:16.98 --> 01:42:18.98
And also the YouTube.

1464
01:42:18.98 --> 01:42:20.98
Again, and I say this all the time.

1465
01:42:20.98 --> 01:42:22.98
I'm putting more videos on there.

1466
01:42:22.98 --> 01:42:24.98
It's cool because I'll put little excerpts.

1467
01:42:24.98 --> 01:42:30.98
You know, where, because people on Twitter and stuff, they'll be like, hey, can you just isolate this one?

1468
01:42:30.98 --> 01:42:35.98
Sure.

1469
01:42:35.98 --> 01:42:37.98
Or they'll be like, hey, release this excerpt.

1470
01:42:37.98 --> 01:42:39.98
I want to make a video.

1471
01:42:39.98 --> 01:42:42.98
You can get the videos from YouTube and stuff.

1472
01:42:42.98 --> 01:42:44.98
So they'll be like, hey, episode, I don't know, 40.

1473
01:42:44.98 --> 01:42:46.98
You know, the last closing thing.

1474
01:42:46.98 --> 01:42:54.98
Anyway, so I'll put stuff, not just excerpts, but other videos other than the whole episode of the podcast.

1475
01:42:54.98 --> 01:42:58.98
And when a lot of times when you do those, sometimes they're just excerpts.

1476
01:42:58.98 --> 01:43:01.98
But sometimes there's other things happening in those.

1477
01:43:01.98 --> 01:43:02.98
Thanks, sure.

1478
01:43:02.98 --> 01:43:03.98
Sure.

1479
01:43:03.98 --> 01:43:05.98
I mean, sometimes you make full new video.

1480
01:43:05.98 --> 01:43:09.98
Like the good video where does this come from?

1481
01:43:09.98 --> 01:43:10.98
Yes, yes.

1482
01:43:10.98 --> 01:43:15.98
And I think just as I'll speak for the voice of everyone else, myself included and everyone else,

1483
01:43:15.98 --> 01:43:17.98
that's the thing, this podcast, that's not named echo.

1484
01:43:17.98 --> 01:43:20.98
I think we all want to see more videos.

1485
01:43:20.98 --> 01:43:21.98
That's me.

1486
01:43:21.98 --> 01:43:25.98
And I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to make that hint to you.

1487
01:43:25.98 --> 01:43:26.98
I think I'm making it to you all while.

1488
01:43:26.98 --> 01:43:28.98
I know it's hard work.

1489
01:43:28.98 --> 01:43:29.98
Yeah, you.

1490
01:43:29.98 --> 01:43:34.98
But you know, we're just trying to let you know, we hear on, you know, the listeners and the,

1491
01:43:34.98 --> 01:43:37.98
and the troopers here, we all want to see a little bit more activity.

1492
01:43:37.98 --> 01:43:38.98
Yep.

1493
01:43:38.98 --> 01:43:42.98
And I think I personally think that the more people are subscribing to YouTube,

1494
01:43:42.98 --> 01:43:45.98
the more motivated you're going to get.

1495
01:43:45.98 --> 01:43:46.98
Yeah.

1496
01:43:46.98 --> 01:43:47.98
Yeah.

1497
01:43:47.98 --> 01:43:48.98
I hate to say relying on motivation.

1498
01:43:48.98 --> 01:43:49.98
No, no, no.

1499
01:43:49.98 --> 01:43:51.98
Because I know, I rely on a discipline.

1500
01:43:51.98 --> 01:43:53.98
And I wish you were like, you know what, my discipline is.

1501
01:43:53.98 --> 01:43:57.98
I'm making, you know, one video every two weeks, but I would see that kind of discipline.

1502
01:43:57.98 --> 01:43:57.98
Yeah.

1503
01:43:57.98 --> 01:43:58.98
Really?

1504
01:43:58.98 --> 01:43:59.98
From the end.

1505
01:43:59.98 --> 01:44:03.98
There you go.

1506
01:44:03.98 --> 01:44:04.98
All right.

1507
01:44:04.98 --> 01:44:05.98
Well, hey, we're one step closer.

1508
01:44:05.98 --> 01:44:06.98
Yeah.

1509
01:44:06.98 --> 01:44:08.98
And, you know, expect it.

1510
01:44:08.98 --> 01:44:09.98
Maybe not.

1511
01:44:09.98 --> 01:44:10.98
Today, maybe not tomorrow.

1512
01:44:10.98 --> 01:44:11.98
But I'm on it.

1513
01:44:11.98 --> 01:44:12.98
I'm on it.

1514
01:44:12.98 --> 01:44:13.98
Oh, I like that.

1515
01:44:13.98 --> 01:44:14.98
Speaking of being on it.

1516
01:44:14.98 --> 01:44:16.98
Oh, look what you did there.

1517
01:44:16.98 --> 01:44:17.98
Oh, nicely done.

1518
01:44:17.98 --> 01:44:18.98
Nice.

1519
01:44:18.98 --> 01:44:19.98
Deep on it.

1520
01:44:19.98 --> 01:44:20.98
Deep on it.

1521
01:44:20.98 --> 01:44:25.98
Um, okay. So on it, these supplements, we all know that.

1522
01:44:25.98 --> 01:44:29.98
A lot of people, a lot of people don't think that I work out just because they don't see me.

1523
01:44:29.98 --> 01:44:30.98
They hear my voice.

1524
01:44:30.98 --> 01:44:32.98
So like, oh, I could obviously doesn't work out.

1525
01:44:32.98 --> 01:44:34.98
But Jaco obviously works out.

1526
01:44:34.98 --> 01:44:36.98
Jaco does take supplements.

1527
01:44:36.98 --> 01:44:38.98
So people are like, oh, yeah.

1528
01:44:38.98 --> 01:44:41.98
What is Jaco take?

1529
01:44:41.98 --> 01:44:43.98
Jaco takes krill oil.

1530
01:44:43.98 --> 01:44:45.98
Jaco takes strong bone.

1531
01:44:45.98 --> 01:44:48.98
And Jaco takes alpha brain.

1532
01:44:48.98 --> 01:44:49.98
There you go.

1533
01:44:49.98 --> 01:44:51.98
Strong bone is from on it.

1534
01:44:51.98 --> 01:44:52.98
Oh, yeah.

1535
01:44:52.98 --> 01:44:53.98
Yeah.

1536
01:44:53.98 --> 01:44:54.98
All right.

1537
01:44:54.98 --> 01:44:55.98
There you go.

1538
01:44:55.98 --> 01:44:56.98
So yeah, these are actual supplements.

1539
01:44:56.98 --> 01:44:57.98
I take the exact same thing.

1540
01:44:57.98 --> 01:44:58.98
Not the strong bone.

1541
01:44:58.98 --> 01:44:59.98
I set for the strong bone.

1542
01:44:59.98 --> 01:45:00.98
I love to one out.

1543
01:45:00.98 --> 01:45:01.98
What?

1544
01:45:01.98 --> 01:45:02.98
Shrimp tech.

1545
01:45:02.98 --> 01:45:03.98
Shrimp tech.

1546
01:45:03.98 --> 01:45:04.98
Shrimp tech.

1547
01:45:04.98 --> 01:45:05.98
Yeah.

1548
01:45:05.98 --> 01:45:05.98
Okay.

1549
01:45:05.98 --> 01:45:06.98
There you go.

1550
01:45:06.98 --> 01:45:08.98
Shrimp tech is is good.

1551
01:45:08.98 --> 01:45:10.98
And I actually, we train today.

1552
01:45:10.98 --> 01:45:11.98
It's Sunday.

1553
01:45:11.98 --> 01:45:12.98
We train today.

1554
01:45:12.98 --> 01:45:13.98
We train today hard.

1555
01:45:13.98 --> 01:45:15.98
I did not take shrimp tech today.

1556
01:45:15.98 --> 01:45:18.98
And I didn't feel like I brought my egg in the way I wanted to.

1557
01:45:18.98 --> 01:45:20.98
So it's too bad.

1558
01:45:20.98 --> 01:45:21.98
Yeah.

1559
01:45:21.98 --> 01:45:22.98
No, no.

1560
01:45:22.98 --> 01:45:23.98
It was good enough.

1561
01:45:23.98 --> 01:45:24.98
Yeah.

1562
01:45:24.98 --> 01:45:29.98
But I felt like I was breathing harder.

1563
01:45:29.98 --> 01:45:30.98
Yeah.

1564
01:45:30.98 --> 01:45:31.98
Yeah.

1565
01:45:31.98 --> 01:45:32.98
Good rolls today.

1566
01:45:32.98 --> 01:45:33.98
Yeah.

1567
01:45:33.98 --> 01:45:34.98
Good.

1568
01:45:34.98 --> 01:45:35.98
Taylor.

1569
01:45:35.98 --> 01:45:36.98
Yeah.

1570
01:45:36.98 --> 01:45:38.98
He's when does he compete next week?

1571
01:45:38.98 --> 01:45:39.98
Yeah.

1572
01:45:39.98 --> 01:45:39.98
Yeah.

1573
01:45:39.98 --> 01:45:40.98
It's like, it's very similar.

1574
01:45:40.98 --> 01:45:41.98
Yeah.

1575
01:45:41.98 --> 01:45:42.98
He's good man.

1576
01:45:42.98 --> 01:45:43.98
Yeah.

1577
01:45:43.98 --> 01:45:44.98
This early on too.

1578
01:45:44.98 --> 01:45:46.98
Even if he wasn't this early on.

1579
01:45:46.98 --> 01:45:49.98
Anyway, we'll talk about Taylor soon.

1580
01:45:49.98 --> 01:45:50.98
Yeah.

1581
01:45:50.98 --> 01:45:51.98
Even more.

1582
01:45:51.98 --> 01:45:53.98
But yeah, I get the cake.

1583
01:45:53.98 --> 01:45:54.98
On it has the best supplements.

1584
01:45:54.98 --> 01:45:56.98
We all know that.

1585
01:45:56.98 --> 01:45:59.98
All legit because a lot of supplements straight up don't work.

1586
01:45:59.98 --> 01:46:02.98
They some supplements rely on the placebo effect.

1587
01:46:02.98 --> 01:46:04.98
Literally rely on that.

1588
01:46:04.98 --> 01:46:06.98
Like that's its effectiveness.

1589
01:46:06.98 --> 01:46:08.98
That's why it's effective because of police.

1590
01:46:08.98 --> 01:46:10.98
Police, police, police, not on it.

1591
01:46:10.98 --> 01:46:11.98
You can find out about this stuff on the website.

1592
01:46:11.98 --> 01:46:15.98
But if you want 10% off those supplements that you're going to get.

1593
01:46:15.98 --> 01:46:19.98
On it dot com slash jockel 10% off.

1594
01:46:19.98 --> 01:46:20.98
Boom.

1595
01:46:20.98 --> 01:46:21.98
I like it.

1596
01:46:21.98 --> 01:46:22.98
So yeah, do that man.

1597
01:46:22.98 --> 01:46:24.98
Support yourself at the same time.

1598
01:46:24.98 --> 01:46:27.98
That's why I like to think.

1599
01:46:27.98 --> 01:46:29.98
And then how about those.

1600
01:46:29.98 --> 01:46:31.98
My what the jockel store.

1601
01:46:31.98 --> 01:46:33.98
Jockel store has some new items.

1602
01:46:33.98 --> 01:46:36.98
So if you look on Instagram, you posted a picture today.

1603
01:46:36.98 --> 01:46:37.98
I did.

1604
01:46:37.98 --> 01:46:38.98
I did. Yes.

1605
01:46:38.98 --> 01:46:42.98
But now today is relative because when this podcast comes out,

1606
01:46:42.98 --> 01:46:43.98
it won't be true.

1607
01:46:43.98 --> 01:46:44.98
Yeah.

1608
01:46:44.98 --> 01:46:45.98
Did.

1609
01:46:45.98 --> 01:46:46.98
October 2nd.

1610
01:46:46.98 --> 01:46:48.98
Oh, people are going to attract the date.

1611
01:46:48.98 --> 01:46:49.98
Okay.

1612
01:46:49.98 --> 01:46:50.98
Okay.

1613
01:46:50.98 --> 01:46:51.98
My dad's birthday by the way.

1614
01:46:51.98 --> 01:46:52.98
Did it happen birthday?

1615
01:46:52.98 --> 01:46:53.98
I was father.

1616
01:46:53.98 --> 01:46:54.98
Happy birthday.

1617
01:46:54.98 --> 01:46:55.98
BC.

1618
01:46:55.98 --> 01:46:57.98
William Charles Junne.

1619
01:46:57.98 --> 01:46:58.98
Bravo Charlie.

1620
01:46:58.98 --> 01:47:00.98
Because my BC on coi happy birthday dad.

1621
01:47:00.98 --> 01:47:01.98
Love you.

1622
01:47:01.98 --> 01:47:06.98
Um, so on my dad's birthday, jockel posted a picture on Instagram.

1623
01:47:06.98 --> 01:47:08.98
October 2nd.

1624
01:47:08.98 --> 01:47:09.98
And one of the comments.

1625
01:47:09.98 --> 01:47:11.98
I just read it.

1626
01:47:11.98 --> 01:47:12.98
Little while ago.

1627
01:47:12.98 --> 01:47:15.98
Um, it says, hey, where do I get that good shirt?

1628
01:47:15.98 --> 01:47:17.98
Or where do I get a jockel shirt?

1629
01:47:17.98 --> 01:47:18.98
Oh.

1630
01:47:18.98 --> 01:47:20.98
That's an interesting question, right?

1631
01:47:20.98 --> 01:47:21.98
Yeah.

1632
01:47:21.98 --> 01:47:23.98
Because there's only one place in the world.

1633
01:47:23.98 --> 01:47:24.98
You can get that.

1634
01:47:24.98 --> 01:47:24.98
Yeah.

1635
01:47:24.98 --> 01:47:25.98
And we say it a lot.

1636
01:47:25.98 --> 01:47:28.98
But nonetheless, you know, it's obligated to listen to me talk about

1637
01:47:28.98 --> 01:47:29.98
Jockel store.

1638
01:47:29.98 --> 01:47:30.98
Yeah.

1639
01:47:30.98 --> 01:47:31.98
Really?

1640
01:47:31.98 --> 01:47:33.98
People fast forward when they get to you talking about stuff.

1641
01:47:33.98 --> 01:47:34.98
I would not, I have not surprised.

1642
01:47:34.98 --> 01:47:35.98
If people do, I'm not surprised.

1643
01:47:35.98 --> 01:47:37.98
Are they missing some nuggets?

1644
01:47:37.98 --> 01:47:38.98
They're missing some information.

1645
01:47:38.98 --> 01:47:39.98
I think they're missing some information.

1646
01:47:39.98 --> 01:47:41.98
I think they're missing some good times too.

1647
01:47:41.98 --> 01:47:42.98
Yeah.

1648
01:47:42.98 --> 01:47:43.98
Potentially, sure.

1649
01:47:43.98 --> 01:47:44.98
Yes.

1650
01:47:44.98 --> 01:47:48.98
So, how they're going to know it was B.C's birthday.

1651
01:47:48.98 --> 01:47:49.98
To that to do?

1652
01:47:49.98 --> 01:47:50.98
Yeah.

1653
01:47:50.98 --> 01:47:51.98
That's the other way.

1654
01:47:51.98 --> 01:47:52.98
Yeah.

1655
01:47:52.98 --> 01:47:53.98
Great point.

1656
01:47:53.98 --> 01:47:54.98
Yeah.

1657
01:47:54.98 --> 01:47:59.98
So, I would say it's a little fast forward through these, but do what you like.

1658
01:47:59.98 --> 01:48:02.98
You know, what if you're on your way to go do some pull-ups or something?

1659
01:48:02.98 --> 01:48:04.98
And you're like, the books done.

1660
01:48:04.98 --> 01:48:05.98
We're done with the book.

1661
01:48:05.98 --> 01:48:06.98
Hmm.

1662
01:48:06.98 --> 01:48:08.98
Time to do some pull-ups.

1663
01:48:08.98 --> 01:48:09.98
Then that'd be cool.

1664
01:48:09.98 --> 01:48:12.98
You know what's weird though when you listen to other podcasts?

1665
01:48:12.98 --> 01:48:19.38
Well, specifically, if you listen to Joe Rogan's podcast, which I do, sometimes they're

1666
01:48:19.38 --> 01:48:20.38
just straight talking.

1667
01:48:20.38 --> 01:48:21.38
Yeah.

1668
01:48:21.38 --> 01:48:24.70
Which is what we're doing right now.

1669
01:48:24.70 --> 01:48:29.02
We are talking about it is enclosed around some subject matter, because we're talking

1670
01:48:29.02 --> 01:48:32.30
about ways to support the podcast.

1671
01:48:32.30 --> 01:48:35.70
So, yeah, but it's still like I said, there's some nuggets in there.

1672
01:48:35.70 --> 01:48:36.70
Sure.

1673
01:48:36.70 --> 01:48:37.70
That are important.

1674
01:48:37.70 --> 01:48:38.70
Yeah.

1675
01:48:38.70 --> 01:48:39.70
And even if they're not important.

1676
01:48:39.70 --> 01:48:42.70
What's funny is even if they're not important.

1677
01:48:42.70 --> 01:48:43.70
They're there.

1678
01:48:43.70 --> 01:48:45.70
This is what I think is cool.

1679
01:48:45.70 --> 01:48:50.10
When I go as I travel a lot and I've been traveling on and I'm starting to meet just

1680
01:48:50.10 --> 01:48:53.70
like, troopers everywhere everywhere.

1681
01:48:53.70 --> 01:48:58.82
I was all over the world all the way from New Zealand to East Coast up and down East

1682
01:48:58.82 --> 01:48:59.82
Coast.

1683
01:48:59.82 --> 01:49:01.70
I meet meet troopers everywhere.

1684
01:49:01.70 --> 01:49:05.62
And when I meet people, all of a sudden, it's like, it's like friends that you have

1685
01:49:05.62 --> 01:49:06.62
inside jokes with.

1686
01:49:06.62 --> 01:49:07.62
Right.

1687
01:49:07.62 --> 01:49:10.54
Yeah.

1688
01:49:10.54 --> 01:49:11.54
Yeah.

1689
01:49:11.54 --> 01:49:12.90
And then they make cracks about this and about that and it's all from the podcast.

1690
01:49:12.90 --> 01:49:14.86
So that's kind of cool.

1691
01:49:14.86 --> 01:49:19.34
It's not just hey, get on here and get educated about life leadership business.

1692
01:49:19.34 --> 01:49:20.34
War.

1693
01:49:20.34 --> 01:49:21.34
You know what?

1694
01:49:21.34 --> 01:49:24.22
Let's have some inside jokes that we can laugh at each other.

1695
01:49:24.22 --> 01:49:30.18
When I show up at, you know, you're whatever you work to do some work myself.

1696
01:49:30.18 --> 01:49:31.18
Yeah.

1697
01:49:31.18 --> 01:49:32.18
Yeah.

1698
01:49:32.18 --> 01:49:33.82
People come to the gym and they'll tell me good evening.

1699
01:49:33.82 --> 01:49:34.82
You never stayed that.

1700
01:49:34.82 --> 01:49:35.82
Oh, you like good evening.

1701
01:49:35.82 --> 01:49:40.82
At least a quarter of the reviews for Jocquay T.

1702
01:49:40.82 --> 01:49:43.82
We start off with Good evening, I go.

1703
01:49:43.82 --> 01:49:44.82
Yes.

1704
01:49:44.82 --> 01:49:45.82
Good evening.

1705
01:49:45.82 --> 01:49:50.82
I don't even know what started that.

1706
01:49:50.82 --> 01:49:51.82
I mean, obviously, I said it.

1707
01:49:51.82 --> 01:49:52.82
I think you started it.

1708
01:49:52.82 --> 01:49:54.82
No, I absolutely started it.

1709
01:49:54.82 --> 01:50:00.82
But, but at some point, I mean, I don't know how else to introduce you, right?

1710
01:50:00.82 --> 01:50:02.82
Other than to say, Good evening.

1711
01:50:02.82 --> 01:50:04.82
Yeah, you just kept, you sort of just kept doing it.

1712
01:50:04.82 --> 01:50:05.82
Yeah.

1713
01:50:05.82 --> 01:50:06.82
Yeah.

1714
01:50:06.82 --> 01:50:09.82
And you, your response is now standard, too.

1715
01:50:09.82 --> 01:50:11.82
Well, what else would you say, you know?

1716
01:50:11.82 --> 01:50:12.82
I guess you don't can't say much.

1717
01:50:12.82 --> 01:50:13.82
Good evening.

1718
01:50:13.82 --> 01:50:14.82
Good evening.

1719
01:50:14.82 --> 01:50:15.82
Amen.

1720
01:50:15.82 --> 01:50:16.82
I like it.

1721
01:50:16.82 --> 01:50:17.82
I like it.

1722
01:50:17.82 --> 01:50:18.82
I'm going to stick with Good evening.

1723
01:50:18.82 --> 01:50:19.82
I think I like that.

1724
01:50:19.82 --> 01:50:20.82
There it is.

1725
01:50:20.82 --> 01:50:24.82
But to answer that question, let's say someone else had that question.

1726
01:50:24.82 --> 01:50:26.82
Where do I get a Jocquay shirt?

1727
01:50:26.82 --> 01:50:29.82
I'll tell you where you get a Jocquay shirt.

1728
01:50:29.82 --> 01:50:30.82
Jocquay store.

1729
01:50:30.82 --> 01:50:32.82
That's again.

1730
01:50:32.82 --> 01:50:34.82
Love the marketing on that.

1731
01:50:34.82 --> 01:50:35.82
Yeah.

1732
01:50:35.82 --> 01:50:36.82
We got Scott Cree.

1733
01:50:36.82 --> 01:50:37.82
We got Scott Cree.

1734
01:50:37.82 --> 01:50:39.82
It's a store from Jocquay.

1735
01:50:39.82 --> 01:50:41.82
It's online.com.

1736
01:50:41.82 --> 01:50:42.82
Jocquay store.com.

1737
01:50:42.82 --> 01:50:45.82
Yes, we have shirts there.

1738
01:50:45.82 --> 01:50:47.82
We have travel mugs.

1739
01:50:47.82 --> 01:50:49.82
You know, the kind you bring with you.

1740
01:50:49.82 --> 01:50:50.82
They're not the, the sh- Oh, this kind.

1741
01:50:50.82 --> 01:50:52.82
You can put your Jocquay T shirt.

1742
01:50:52.82 --> 01:50:53.82
Yep.

1743
01:50:53.82 --> 01:50:55.82
If you choose to, yes, exactly.

1744
01:50:55.82 --> 01:50:58.82
And some, some bumper stickers that are kind of cool.

1745
01:50:58.82 --> 01:51:01.82
They're on Jocquay store.com as well.

1746
01:51:01.82 --> 01:51:03.82
And this one of the sticks on there, cool.

1747
01:51:03.82 --> 01:51:04.82
We have patches.

1748
01:51:04.82 --> 01:51:06.82
Okay, here's the thing about the patch about patches.

1749
01:51:06.82 --> 01:51:10.82
Someone online saying, hey, get the Velcro patches.

1750
01:51:10.82 --> 01:51:13.82
And I'm just not as familiar with the Velcro patches.

1751
01:51:13.82 --> 01:51:15.82
We already had these other two patches.

1752
01:51:15.82 --> 01:51:16.82
One is the Jiu-Jitsu patch.

1753
01:51:16.82 --> 01:51:19.82
The other one is the Jiu-Jitsu patch, but it's all purpose patch.

1754
01:51:19.82 --> 01:51:21.82
You know, you can iron it on, but you sew it on.

1755
01:51:21.82 --> 01:51:23.82
Four inches by three inches.

1756
01:51:23.82 --> 01:51:25.82
The Velcro patch up like that's a good idea.

1757
01:51:25.82 --> 01:51:26.82
The Velcro patch.

1758
01:51:26.82 --> 01:51:28.82
Let me get the same thing for it's 4x3.

1759
01:51:28.82 --> 01:51:30.82
It's a Velcro patch.

1760
01:51:30.82 --> 01:51:31.82
So it's cool for that.

1761
01:51:31.82 --> 01:51:35.82
But you explained to me, those Velcro patches are interchangeable.

1762
01:51:35.82 --> 01:51:37.82
The standard is 3x2.

1763
01:51:37.82 --> 01:51:38.82
Yeah.

1764
01:51:38.82 --> 01:51:39.82
Three across.

1765
01:51:39.82 --> 01:51:44.82
So just understand the Velcro patch currently right now is 4x3.

1766
01:51:44.82 --> 01:51:45.82
Did you get 2x3 in order?

1767
01:51:45.82 --> 01:51:46.82
Yeah.

1768
01:51:46.82 --> 01:51:51.82
So I got to, you know, I didn't finalize it, but they come in pretty quick.

1769
01:51:51.82 --> 01:51:54.82
So just know, just be aware of the dimensions of the patch.

1770
01:51:54.82 --> 01:51:58.82
If you want to do the interchangeable one, I guess technically you could put the 4x3.

1771
01:51:58.82 --> 01:52:00.82
But we're not doing that.

1772
01:52:00.82 --> 01:52:01.82
I'll get the 2x3 and...

1773
01:52:01.82 --> 01:52:02.82
Don't encourage that.

1774
01:52:02.82 --> 01:52:03.82
Yeah.

1775
01:52:03.82 --> 01:52:04.82
Please.

1776
01:52:04.82 --> 01:52:05.82
Yeah.

1777
01:52:05.82 --> 01:52:06.82
Please not to give it to me.

1778
01:52:06.82 --> 01:52:07.82
Nonetheless.

1779
01:52:07.82 --> 01:52:09.82
They're on Jocco Store as well.

1780
01:52:09.82 --> 01:52:12.82
The Jitsu patches there too, like I said.

1781
01:52:12.82 --> 01:52:15.82
Rash guards are there.

1782
01:52:15.82 --> 01:52:16.82
Big time.

1783
01:52:16.82 --> 01:52:18.82
All on the Jocco Store.

1784
01:52:18.82 --> 01:52:19.82
Somewhere on that corner.

1785
01:52:19.82 --> 01:52:21.82
But they're there in full effect for sure.

1786
01:52:21.82 --> 01:52:23.82
And they're good.

1787
01:52:23.82 --> 01:52:26.82
Five emails.

1788
01:52:26.82 --> 01:52:30.82
Today, saying they felt the 19%.

1789
01:52:30.82 --> 01:52:31.82
Yeah.

1790
01:52:31.82 --> 01:52:32.82
They've been performing.

1791
01:52:32.82 --> 01:52:33.82
Allegedly.

1792
01:52:33.82 --> 01:52:35.82
There's no alleged about it.

1793
01:52:35.82 --> 01:52:36.82
Yes.

1794
01:52:36.82 --> 01:52:39.82
How can you say that's alleged when people are, I factually felt the difference.

1795
01:52:39.82 --> 01:52:40.82
Oh well, that it's just what they're...

1796
01:52:40.82 --> 01:52:41.82
What they're just skepticking on?

1797
01:52:41.82 --> 01:52:42.82
No.

1798
01:52:42.82 --> 01:52:43.82
It's what they said.

1799
01:52:43.82 --> 01:52:44.82
I wasn't there to witness it.

1800
01:52:44.82 --> 01:52:45.82
Oh no.

1801
01:52:45.82 --> 01:52:47.82
But if you're saying to tell you that a 19% improvement if they did not...

1802
01:52:47.82 --> 01:52:50.82
But they alleged it that it was an allegation.

1803
01:52:50.82 --> 01:52:51.82
No.

1804
01:52:51.82 --> 01:52:52.82
I don't support you all that.

1805
01:52:52.82 --> 01:52:53.82
Technically.

1806
01:52:53.82 --> 01:52:54.82
We're falling out of grace here, man.

1807
01:52:54.82 --> 01:52:57.82
When somebody tells me they got 19% improvement with the rashguard.

1808
01:52:57.82 --> 01:52:58.82
Top get his fat.

1809
01:52:58.82 --> 01:52:59.82
Yeah.

1810
01:52:59.82 --> 01:53:00.82
Yeah.

1811
01:53:00.82 --> 01:53:01.82
I would be lied to you.

1812
01:53:01.82 --> 01:53:03.82
Otherwise, if you say, hey, give me my money back.

1813
01:53:03.82 --> 01:53:04.82
I didn't get a 19% improvement.

1814
01:53:04.82 --> 01:53:04.82
Yeah.

1815
01:53:04.82 --> 01:53:05.82
That's good.

1816
01:53:05.82 --> 01:53:07.82
That's too very good points.

1817
01:53:07.82 --> 01:53:10.82
And with women's tank tops.

1818
01:53:10.82 --> 01:53:11.82
I understand.

1819
01:53:11.82 --> 01:53:12.82
It's fall.

1820
01:53:12.82 --> 01:53:14.82
We're going into winter soon.

1821
01:53:14.82 --> 01:53:15.82
Tank tops.

1822
01:53:17.82 --> 01:53:19.82
I don't think that's a Southern Hemisphere people.

1823
01:53:19.82 --> 01:53:20.82
Sure.

1824
01:53:20.82 --> 01:53:21.82
Yeah.

1825
01:53:21.82 --> 01:53:21.82
The West.

1826
01:53:21.82 --> 01:53:21.82
Yeah.

1827
01:53:21.82 --> 01:53:22.82
Because it's summer down there.

1828
01:53:22.82 --> 01:53:23.82
It's going to be summertime soon.

1829
01:53:23.82 --> 01:53:27.82
Down in New Zealand and Australia and South America.

1830
01:53:27.82 --> 01:53:28.82
Yeah.

1831
01:53:28.82 --> 01:53:30.82
And the Hawaii people as well.

1832
01:53:30.82 --> 01:53:32.82
From Hawaii we don't know about that kind.

1833
01:53:32.82 --> 01:53:36.82
And that's why you're saying, you don't understand what a hoodie is.

1834
01:53:36.82 --> 01:53:37.82
Yeah.

1835
01:53:37.82 --> 01:53:38.82
From Hawaii.

1836
01:53:38.82 --> 01:53:39.82
Like we kind of...

1837
01:53:39.82 --> 01:53:41.82
We know what a hoodie is.

1838
01:53:41.82 --> 01:53:41.82
Yeah.

1839
01:53:41.82 --> 01:53:42.82
We don't know what a hoodie is.

1840
01:53:42.82 --> 01:53:43.82
We don't know.

1841
01:53:43.82 --> 01:53:44.82
Yeah.

1842
01:53:44.82 --> 01:53:44.82
So we're making hoodies.

1843
01:53:44.82 --> 01:53:45.82
Yes.

1844
01:53:45.82 --> 01:53:50.82
So we made it with consultation from Jocco and then some New England people.

1845
01:53:50.82 --> 01:53:54.82
We got hoodies on the way as well.

1846
01:53:54.82 --> 01:53:57.82
And women's t-shirts as well.

1847
01:53:57.82 --> 01:53:58.82
Yeah.

1848
01:53:58.82 --> 01:54:00.82
I was explaining to Echo that in New England.

1849
01:54:00.82 --> 01:54:09.82
Like a hoodie is like something you wear every single day for nine months out of the year.

1850
01:54:09.82 --> 01:54:10.82
You wear a hoodie.

1851
01:54:10.82 --> 01:54:11.82
Yeah.

1852
01:54:11.82 --> 01:54:12.82
Oh.

1853
01:54:12.82 --> 01:54:13.82
I'm waking up.

1854
01:54:13.82 --> 01:54:14.82
I'm putting on a hoodie.

1855
01:54:14.82 --> 01:54:15.82
Yeah.

1856
01:54:15.82 --> 01:54:16.82
That's what you do.

1857
01:54:16.82 --> 01:54:17.82
Yes.

1858
01:54:17.82 --> 01:54:19.82
So we got to make.

1859
01:54:19.82 --> 01:54:22.82
And representing with their hoodie.

1860
01:54:22.82 --> 01:54:23.82
And they'll be toasty or.

1861
01:54:23.82 --> 01:54:24.82
Yeah.

1862
01:54:24.82 --> 01:54:25.82
Which.

1863
01:54:25.82 --> 01:54:27.82
Interesting for Echo Better Term.

1864
01:54:27.82 --> 01:54:30.82
My wife is one of those hoodie people.

1865
01:54:30.82 --> 01:54:32.82
You know the kind of where she wears a hoodie every single day.

1866
01:54:32.82 --> 01:54:34.82
Even when it's not cold.

1867
01:54:34.82 --> 01:54:35.82
Hmm.

1868
01:54:35.82 --> 01:54:37.82
She'll be like, it's like a comfort zone thing, you know.

1869
01:54:37.82 --> 01:54:38.82
It's just a bunch of them.

1870
01:54:38.82 --> 01:54:40.82
But I don't even know how many.

1871
01:54:40.82 --> 01:54:44.82
She even took Greg trains victory hoodie.

1872
01:54:44.82 --> 01:54:45.82
Oh.

1873
01:54:45.82 --> 01:54:46.82
And she uses Alan.

1874
01:54:46.82 --> 01:54:47.82
That one of her many.

1875
01:54:47.82 --> 01:54:48.82
Anyway.

1876
01:54:48.82 --> 01:54:49.82
That's a good ho it.

1877
01:54:49.82 --> 01:54:50.82
That was got those are good.

1878
01:54:50.82 --> 01:54:51.82
Yeah.

1879
01:54:51.82 --> 01:54:52.82
Yeah.

1880
01:54:52.82 --> 01:54:53.82
So yeah.

1881
01:54:53.82 --> 01:54:54.82
So there it is.

1882
01:54:54.82 --> 01:54:55.82
We're going to have that coming out.

1883
01:54:55.82 --> 01:54:58.82
That should be within the next two to three weeks.

1884
01:54:58.82 --> 01:55:01.82
I think that's a fair amount of time to say.

1885
01:55:01.82 --> 01:55:02.82
And it be accurate.

1886
01:55:02.82 --> 01:55:04.82
So there it is.

1887
01:55:04.82 --> 01:55:08.82
JoccoStore.com in the event of you wanting to support this podcast in that way.

1888
01:55:08.82 --> 01:55:09.82
Get some stuff.

1889
01:55:09.82 --> 01:55:10.82
Get a lot of things.

1890
01:55:10.82 --> 01:55:11.82
Two things.

1891
01:55:11.82 --> 01:55:12.82
Whatever you want.

1892
01:55:12.82 --> 01:55:14.82
Once again appreciate all that support.

1893
01:55:14.82 --> 01:55:20.82
So if you want, if you don't have a book that is written by a guy named Lave Babin, my brother

1894
01:55:20.82 --> 01:55:22.82
and myself, we wrote a book.

1895
01:55:22.82 --> 01:55:23.82
Call the stream ownership.

1896
01:55:23.82 --> 01:55:24.82
Even you want to pick it up.

1897
01:55:24.82 --> 01:55:25.82
You can pick it up.

1898
01:55:25.82 --> 01:55:29.82
You know, an Amazon or anywhere else at the cell books.

1899
01:55:29.82 --> 01:55:31.82
And we get so much good feedback on it.

1900
01:55:31.82 --> 01:55:32.82
It's awesome.

1901
01:55:32.82 --> 01:55:34.82
I appreciate all the positive feedback.

1902
01:55:34.82 --> 01:55:38.82
You know, people read it and they say, this really helped me.

1903
01:55:38.82 --> 01:55:41.82
You know, not just with the way I'm doing my business.

1904
01:55:41.82 --> 01:55:43.82
But like with the normal stuff in the life.

1905
01:55:43.82 --> 01:55:45.82
And the other cool thing is when people buy it for their team.

1906
01:55:45.82 --> 01:55:48.82
You know, or they even buy it for the boss sometimes.

1907
01:55:48.82 --> 01:55:50.82
So pick up extreme ownership.

1908
01:55:50.82 --> 01:55:52.82
We did the audio to if you want to read it.

1909
01:55:52.82 --> 01:55:56.82
If you don't want to read it because you know, time you just want to listen to it while you're in the in the traffic jam.

1910
01:55:56.82 --> 01:55:59.82
Then just buy the audio book and you'll be good to go.

1911
01:55:59.82 --> 01:56:00.82
So appreciate that.

1912
01:56:00.82 --> 01:56:04.82
And then also if you dig that extreme ownership, you dig that concept.

1913
01:56:04.82 --> 01:56:09.82
You can come out to something we're having here in Southern California in San Diego called the

1914
01:56:09.82 --> 01:56:13.82
Master, the extreme ownership master. We're going to be talking about leadership.

1915
01:56:13.82 --> 01:56:19.82
We're going to be talking about how to take the lessons that we learned in combat, which have been proven in combat.

1916
01:56:19.82 --> 01:56:25.82
And how you can apply those same lessons doing leadership in business leadership in life.

1917
01:56:25.82 --> 01:56:28.82
So we got a bunch of you are coming to us.

1918
01:56:28.82 --> 01:56:30.82
And it's awesome.

1919
01:56:30.82 --> 01:56:34.82
So and I had somebody email me the other day.

1920
01:56:34.82 --> 01:56:38.82
And it said, say, hey, listen, I just wanted to let you know.

1921
01:56:38.82 --> 01:56:42.82
I don't come into the master, but in the event, I don't get to meet you there.

1922
01:56:42.82 --> 01:56:44.82
Then, you know, I just want to let you know.

1923
01:56:44.82 --> 01:56:48.82
I really appreciate, you know, the podcast and the book and all that.

1924
01:56:48.82 --> 01:56:49.82
And I didn't even respond yet.

1925
01:56:49.82 --> 01:56:51.82
I don't think I could a lot of emails.

1926
01:56:51.82 --> 01:56:52.82
But let me tell you something.

1927
01:56:52.82 --> 01:56:54.82
If you come to the master, we're hanging out.

1928
01:56:54.82 --> 01:56:58.82
It's not going to be one of these gigs where, you know, I'm back in the green room.

1929
01:56:58.82 --> 01:57:00.82
We're going to go out, um, getting in character.

1930
01:57:00.82 --> 01:57:03.82
Well, no, I, this is my character.

1931
01:57:03.82 --> 01:57:04.82
And I won't be backstage.

1932
01:57:04.82 --> 01:57:06.82
I'll be in, I'll be sitting at a table with you.

1933
01:57:06.82 --> 01:57:09.82
I'll be talking. I'll be, and lace can be doing the same thing.

1934
01:57:09.82 --> 01:57:14.82
So that's one of the major differentiators we want to have in this thing is that,

1935
01:57:14.82 --> 01:57:17.82
because, you know, late for night go to these events all the time because we speak at them.

1936
01:57:17.82 --> 01:57:20.82
You know, leadership events and conferences and all that.

1937
01:57:20.82 --> 01:57:23.82
The biggest differentiator that we want to make is we want to be.

1938
01:57:23.82 --> 01:57:25.82
We want to have the contact.

1939
01:57:25.82 --> 01:57:26.82
We want to have the face to face.

1940
01:57:26.82 --> 01:57:31.82
So if you're coming, not only are you going to meet me, we're going to kick it.

1941
01:57:31.82 --> 01:57:32.82
We're going to be hanging out.

1942
01:57:32.82 --> 01:57:33.82
We're going to be having dinner lunch.

1943
01:57:33.82 --> 01:57:35.82
We're going to be going over problems when we talk about solutions.

1944
01:57:35.82 --> 01:57:38.82
So don't think that I'm going to be.

1945
01:57:38.82 --> 01:57:41.82
And that, and that late for is going to be all hiding in the background.

1946
01:57:41.82 --> 01:57:42.82
No, we're going to be there.

1947
01:57:42.82 --> 01:57:43.82
I'll be meeting you.

1948
01:57:43.82 --> 01:57:44.82
Will we do an workout also?

1949
01:57:44.82 --> 01:57:45.82
Some people want to try.

1950
01:57:45.82 --> 01:57:48.82
If you train that you get to and you come out here.

1951
01:57:48.82 --> 01:57:51.82
Come out here a little bit early or stay a little bit late.

1952
01:57:51.82 --> 01:57:53.82
And we're going to go to the gym.

1953
01:57:53.82 --> 01:57:54.82
We're going to go to the victory MMA.

1954
01:57:54.82 --> 01:57:57.82
And you can challenge echelotronals to a death match.

1955
01:57:57.82 --> 01:57:59.82
The other node will be there.

1956
01:57:59.82 --> 01:58:00.82
We'll be there rolling.

1957
01:58:00.82 --> 01:58:04.82
So, you know, if you, if you, if you stay Friday, if you stay Saturday,

1958
01:58:04.82 --> 01:58:08.82
if you stay Sunday, I will be there Friday night.

1959
01:58:08.82 --> 01:58:09.82
I'll be there Saturday day.

1960
01:58:09.82 --> 01:58:10.82
I'll be there Sunday day.

1961
01:58:10.82 --> 01:58:12.82
And we'll be getting it on.

1962
01:58:12.82 --> 01:58:16.82
So come on out for that for that monster.

1963
01:58:16.82 --> 01:58:18.82
And that'll be that'll be awesome.

1964
01:58:18.82 --> 01:58:21.82
Also, if you can't come out to the monster,

1965
01:58:21.82 --> 01:58:25.82
but you just want to kind of kick it and keep these things going on.

1966
01:58:25.82 --> 01:58:27.82
And you want to join the crew.

1967
01:58:27.82 --> 01:58:32.82
Then all you got to do is get on social media,

1968
01:58:32.82 --> 01:58:37.82
which, which, which, which, I didn't really understand social media a year ago.

1969
01:58:37.82 --> 01:58:39.82
You know, I didn't know what it was all about.

1970
01:58:39.82 --> 01:58:45.82
But now what I know is I get to talk to people and I get to get to grow my knowledge from other people

1971
01:58:45.82 --> 01:58:50.82
who, who can communicate things, who ask really good questions that I got to get research or I know an answer to

1972
01:58:50.82 --> 01:58:53.82
and then they ask me something else and so, so that's awesome.

1973
01:58:53.82 --> 01:58:56.82
And funny bunch of people post all kinds of funny stuff.

1974
01:58:56.82 --> 01:58:58.82
So I'm getting entertained.

1975
01:58:58.82 --> 01:59:01.82
And we're getting, you know, a crew.

1976
01:59:01.82 --> 01:59:06.82
And having a bunch of people there that are like-minded and is, is, is fun to have.

1977
01:59:06.82 --> 01:59:09.82
And so I appreciate it. If you want to find us on social media.

1978
01:59:09.82 --> 01:59:13.82
Echo is, by the way, he's at Echo Charles.

1979
01:59:13.82 --> 01:59:17.82
And that's on Instagram. That's on Twitter.

1980
01:59:17.82 --> 01:59:19.82
That's on that Facebookie.

1981
01:59:19.82 --> 01:59:25.82
And I am also on social media.

1982
01:59:25.82 --> 01:59:30.82
And I am at Jockel Willink on Twitter on Instagram on the Facebookie.

1983
01:59:30.82 --> 01:59:33.82
I am also there.

1984
01:59:33.82 --> 01:59:39.82
And I guess that's about it for this week.

1985
01:59:39.82 --> 01:59:43.82
We don't think we have time for the Q&A.

1986
01:59:43.82 --> 01:59:45.82
We'll push that.

1987
01:59:45.82 --> 01:59:54.82
And in the meantime, you know, again, I know we got to- I'm meeting people all over the place.

1988
01:59:54.82 --> 01:59:57.82
And thank you all for supporting this podcast.

1989
01:59:57.82 --> 02:00:02.82
Thank you all for doing what you do. Meet fire fighters, working with firefighters, meet police officers,

1990
02:00:02.82 --> 02:00:05.82
work with police officers, the military folks that are emailing me.

1991
02:00:05.82 --> 02:00:09.82
The guys that are overseas right now, fighting terror.

1992
02:00:09.82 --> 02:00:11.82
Thank all of you.

1993
02:00:11.82 --> 02:00:16.82
You all you uniform folks were what you do for home-aligned overseas and here at home.

1994
02:00:16.82 --> 02:00:20.82
And for everybody else that I'm meeting, I'm meeting people from all kinds of businesses.

1995
02:00:20.82 --> 02:00:21.82
All of you have goals.

1996
02:00:21.82 --> 02:00:23.82
You're trying to make things happen.

1997
02:00:23.82 --> 02:00:25.82
You're not calling, you're not calling us up.

1998
02:00:25.82 --> 02:00:28.82
You're not calling life and I help unless you're trying to dominate.

1999
02:00:28.82 --> 02:00:34.82
So we love the fact that we get to go to places where you got people that are out there trying to kick ass,

2000
02:00:34.82 --> 02:00:35.82
trying to crush it.

2001
02:00:35.82 --> 02:00:40.82
And that's what propels American keeps our country strong, keeps our country free.

2002
02:00:40.82 --> 02:00:46.82
So thank you for what you're doing in all those jobs, all you in the workforce.

2003
02:00:46.82 --> 02:00:47.82
It's awesome.

2004
02:00:47.82 --> 02:00:48.82
We appreciate it.

2005
02:00:48.82 --> 02:00:50.82
And there's one thing we want back from you.

2006
02:00:50.82 --> 02:00:54.82
And as we want to make sure that you keep getting after it.

2007
02:00:54.82 --> 02:01:04.82
And so until next time, this is Echo and Jockel out.
