[00:00:00] This is Jockelpontcast number 252 with Dave Burke and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:08] Good evening Dave.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:10] EchoTrolls is taking care of some other business on the last podcast.
[00:00:17] Number 251 with Lave Babin.
[00:00:20] We started getting into the book guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce
[00:00:26] Clark.
[00:00:27] We only made it 13 pages into and a half hours and it's a 117 page book.
[00:00:33] Just to recap a little bit, this is a book that I searched for for over a decade.
[00:00:38] I originally heard about this book in my favorite book, which is called About Face by Colonel
[00:00:44] David Hackworth.
[00:00:45] I finally found a copy a month and a half ago.
[00:00:50] And so here we are just a little background.
[00:00:52] Once again on General Bruce Clark.
[00:00:55] Number 21 World War II Korea, and listed in 1917, and they have gone to West Point, Colonel
[00:00:59] World War II, then a general commanded the Fourth Armored Division in Patton's Third
[00:01:03] Army, Battle of the Bulge, Distinguished Service Cross, Three Silver Stars, 45 years of service.
[00:01:13] And then spend a bunch of time not only leading troops, but also training troops, or overseeing
[00:01:18] training commands.
[00:01:19] So awesome career, Hackworth talked about him glowingly in the book about face.
[00:01:26] And that's where the start of taking me a long time to find this book.
[00:01:31] Who did somebody texted me about it and said it was the white whale.
[00:01:36] Like, you know, this was that it was.
[00:01:38] Definitely hard for me to find this book, but we have it.
[00:01:40] And that's it.
[00:01:41] That's what we're going to do.
[00:01:42] We're going to go back into this book.
[00:01:44] So here we go back into guidelines for the leader and commander by Bruce General Bruce
[00:01:50] C. Clark.
[00:01:52] So this section starts off with administration, some thoughts for the commander.
[00:02:00] And he says, insumation, I would like to point out the close interrelationship between
[00:02:06] training programs and sound overall management.
[00:02:10] So this is something, you know, when you're that young, gun-hole leader, that's just
[00:02:15] things, hey, where you're to operate, whatever that operation is, whether it's shoot machine
[00:02:20] guns or whether that's out, selling things or making things.
[00:02:23] And you think, hey, I'm on the front line.
[00:02:26] I'm going to make things happen.
[00:02:27] And you think all the administrative stuff you shouldn't have to worry about.
[00:02:31] That's not me.
[00:02:34] And I know many individuals that are like that.
[00:02:37] I know one individual in particular, that's like that whose name is Jockel.
[00:02:42] Because I was definitely like that.
[00:02:44] Many commanders, I was like that when I was younger.
[00:02:49] Because I absolutely, I'd realize this and you can hear, you know, we'll talk about the
[00:02:53] paperwork drills that we had to do and how life and Seth came to me.
[00:02:57] We should not have to do this stuff.
[00:02:58] And I said, oh, we're going to do it.
[00:02:59] We're going to do it better than anybody else.
[00:03:01] So I figured this out, but it is definitely a learning moment that people have.
[00:03:07] And so why not learn it right now.
[00:03:09] Many commanders are defeated by poor administration.
[00:03:11] Imagine that.
[00:03:13] This is that statement.
[00:03:15] Many commanders are defeated by poor administration.
[00:03:18] Not defeated because they were tactfully on sound, not defeated because they made bad decisions,
[00:03:22] not defeated because they couldn't come up with a good plan.
[00:03:24] They just fail because they're administrative losers.
[00:03:31] Without sound administration, a commander cannot succeed in his training and maintenance programs.
[00:03:36] The administration is nothing more than applied common sense.
[00:03:40] I'm including here a number of items that may well be considered a checklist of indicators
[00:03:45] of sound administration.
[00:03:49] Number one, importance of time.
[00:03:54] The principal coordinating device in the army is time.
[00:03:59] Learn the proper time space factors so you can be on time and make reasonable demands
[00:04:04] of your subordinates.
[00:04:06] So that's number one by the way, which is probably why you hear a lot of talk about time management.
[00:04:15] Just think about the idea that the first thing he's going to say is time.
[00:04:18] This is someone who clearly understands that of all the resources in the world that we have.
[00:04:23] That's the one that matters the most because we just can't produce more of that.
[00:04:27] I was going to say it's the one that matters the most.
[00:04:30] And it's the absolute one that we have the least control.
[00:04:32] You know how much control do we have time?
[00:04:34] You have zero.
[00:04:35] You cannot stop it. You cannot bring it back.
[00:04:36] You got to say, I have the power curve.
[00:04:39] I hate that feeling.
[00:04:41] I hate that feeling.
[00:04:42] And let me tell you what.
[00:04:45] I realize this a while back.
[00:04:46] So when you go to the airport, if you show up to the airport late,
[00:04:51] and now look, TSA doesn't care that your late.
[00:04:54] The baggage handler doesn't care that your late.
[00:04:57] The Uber driver does not care what time your plane is leaving.
[00:05:00] They're doing what they're doing.
[00:05:02] And so what that does is it takes you have no control over that time once it started to
[00:05:08] commence.
[00:05:09] What do you have control over?
[00:05:10] Going to the airport a little bit earlier.
[00:05:12] That's all.
[00:05:12] That's all.
[00:05:13] Not that big of a deal.
[00:05:14] Go to the airport a little bit earlier.
[00:05:15] And you won't have to worry about TSA.
[00:05:17] You won't have to worry about baggage.
[00:05:18] You won't have to worry about how long it takes for the Uber driver or the lift.
[00:05:22] Let's give proper credit or lift driver to show up and bring you to the airport.
[00:05:28] So how do you get control? You can't control time once it's unfolding.
[00:05:34] You can't bring it back.
[00:05:35] You have to plan for it appropriately.
[00:05:39] And there's a sense of urgency.
[00:05:41] And I don't have a pretty good sense of urgency.
[00:05:44] And you may or may not.
[00:05:46] I know like at the master, especially the earlier musters when we weren't when the
[00:05:50] backside wasn't quite the well-oiled machine that it is now.
[00:05:54] And certainly as a well-oiled machine now, the early musters, it was not a well-oiled
[00:05:58] machine.
[00:05:58] On the front side, people wouldn't know that when life and I were walking out on stage
[00:06:04] at eight o'clock in the morning, we had two hours of sleep because we had to do so whatever
[00:06:09] we had to do behind the scenes.
[00:06:10] And that's just the way it was.
[00:06:13] I can feel when the shortage of time.
[00:06:18] In fact, I think I feel the shortage of time every single day, every single waking
[00:06:21] minute.
[00:06:25] There's a thing that happened at some point in my life.
[00:06:28] I don't know what when that was.
[00:06:30] But I still think about it now.
[00:06:31] When you were just talking about the feeling, what I thought you were going to talk about
[00:06:33] is the feeling of when you feel like you don't have enough time to do something.
[00:06:36] So being later or whatever, or how I got stuff I needed to prepare for, it used to be
[00:06:41] that I used to feel that it wasn't enough time.
[00:06:44] And the feeling that makes me sick now is at any time I'm behind.
[00:06:47] Which happens.
[00:06:48] I look at like, man, I'm behind.
[00:06:49] I didn't get enough done here.
[00:06:50] I didn't prep enough here.
[00:06:51] Feeling that bothers me the most is looking back on the time that I wasted the day before
[00:06:56] or the week before when I thought, hey, this is now I need to get ahead.
[00:06:59] I got a little window.
[00:07:00] I got some white space here, which is actually pretty rare.
[00:07:03] And I look back on the time that I wasted, which is very different than there isn't
[00:07:07] enough time.
[00:07:08] I honestly don't think I've ever felt like I didn't have enough time.
[00:07:11] I always feel like I have wasted time.
[00:07:15] And that feeling of when I'm behind or unprepared, man, that drives me nuts as I look
[00:07:19] back on what did I do yesterday or the day before?
[00:07:22] How did I waste so much time knowing that I can't get that back?
[00:07:27] And that's the feeling that bothers me.
[00:07:28] I think more than any other feeling is I wasted my time.
[00:07:32] Yeah, that's a, that is a doozy.
[00:07:34] And this is, by the way, item number one.
[00:07:38] Item number one, importance of time.
[00:07:42] Next, anticipate problems.
[00:07:44] Troublesome incidents or situations can be avoided if the probable consequences of existing
[00:07:49] conditions are previously anticipated.
[00:07:53] Incidents do not occur until the stage has been set for some time.
[00:07:58] The outstanding officer knows where things are likely to go wrong and plans preventive
[00:08:04] action.
[00:08:07] Spend a little bit of time thinking of through contingencies and then come up with a plan.
[00:08:13] And you don't even have to come up with this elaborate plan.
[00:08:16] You just have to know what you're going to do in a broad sense.
[00:08:24] Next, personality of the commander.
[00:08:28] Personality of the commander has an enormous influence on his unit.
[00:08:32] In fact, the unit may be said to be nothing but an extension of the commander's personality.
[00:08:38] It is essential that he makes his presence felt by leaving his desk to appear where work
[00:08:44] and training go on and by talking to and knowing and influencing his men.
[00:08:52] How many times did you see that in the Marine Corps?
[00:08:55] How about going for like checking into a squadron?
[00:08:57] How much would the squadron reflect the commander of the squadron?
[00:09:00] Completely.
[00:09:01] I mean, that was the always the ultimate difference.
[00:09:04] Because the thing about squadrons, it's probably true in a seal team, is that if you look
[00:09:07] at the squadrons from the outside, I was base at Miramar.
[00:09:10] There were seven F-18 squadrons when I was there.
[00:09:13] One paper that are all identical.
[00:09:15] Same equipment.
[00:09:16] Same not every metric that you would measure it.
[00:09:19] It's all the same.
[00:09:20] There isn't one squadron, like they get better stuff or better people.
[00:09:24] They just get the same thing that everybody else gets.
[00:09:26] And the only difference was obviously the commander or the leader and the squadrons would
[00:09:30] take on those personalities.
[00:09:34] Almost immediately when the new commander take over.
[00:09:36] It's not, it's crazy.
[00:09:41] It's crazy.
[00:09:42] It's just an extension of the boat crew story and extreme ownership.
[00:09:45] Hey, we swap out.
[00:09:46] We put in a good leader into this boat crew that's failing and all of a sudden you've
[00:09:48] got this totally legit boat crew that's winning.
[00:09:52] And that happens.
[00:09:53] How many people in a squadron?
[00:09:55] 200.
[00:09:56] 200 people.
[00:09:57] How many aircraft?
[00:09:58] 12.
[00:09:59] 12 aircraft.
[00:10:00] 200 people.
[00:10:01] And boom.
[00:10:02] You put a good leader in there.
[00:10:04] But I will say this, though.
[00:10:06] Well, you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:10:07] But the Marine Corps from my experience has a tighter group, a tighter variance on their
[00:10:19] officers than, well, then certainly in the sealed teams.
[00:10:25] So in other words, you might get in the sealed teams.
[00:10:29] You might get these outstanding officers.
[00:10:32] And then you'd get some really good officers, some solid officers that kind of like the
[00:10:35] normal.
[00:10:36] You have some really kick ass guys.
[00:10:38] You have a bunch of normal guys.
[00:10:39] And then you have the bottom group, which would be pretty outside the range.
[00:10:43] So the range would be pretty big.
[00:10:45] It seemed to me like the Marine Corps always had just tight.
[00:10:48] It's more controlled.
[00:10:49] It's a more controlled group.
[00:10:51] It's a tighter group.
[00:10:53] Maybe the high end is not as often that you're going to get some just guy that's outside
[00:11:00] the box of stellar.
[00:11:02] Look, maybe I don't know.
[00:11:05] But I do know this.
[00:11:06] The chances of having a Marine Corps platoon commander that doesn't meet the grade isn't
[00:11:12] very low.
[00:11:15] And in the sealed teams, it would happen more often because there's more slack.
[00:11:19] There's more room.
[00:11:20] You're giving more rope to hang yourself.
[00:11:22] And you give guys rope.
[00:11:24] And they can take that rope and they can turn it into something awesome or they can
[00:11:27] make it hang themselves.
[00:11:29] I always kind of notice that.
[00:11:31] Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:11:36] And when you're inside that, the disparity or that variance becomes more evident to you as
[00:11:39] you're inside that.
[00:11:41] And you can see that.
[00:11:42] So there still is a variance.
[00:11:43] And when we looked at good squadrons or bad squadrons, however you wanted to define that,
[00:11:48] a lot of times it was kind of just a feeling.
[00:11:50] Almost like an intangible quality of that's a good squadron and that's a bad squadron.
[00:11:54] And the way we judge that was how did there people acted?
[00:11:58] And other people acted?
[00:11:59] A reflection of their leadership puts exactly what he just said.
[00:12:02] And the squadrons would take on the persona and the personality of their leaders and the
[00:12:07] good leaders had good squadrons.
[00:12:10] And the bad leaders, or the leaders that weren't as good, their squadrons reflected that.
[00:12:15] So you got 12 aircraft.
[00:12:17] And then are those aircraft broken up into sections or platoon somehow?
[00:12:22] Or is it just every man for himself?
[00:12:24] No, I mean, they had 12 aircraft that didn't theory were all the same.
[00:12:27] You know, they weren't all fliable at a time.
[00:12:28] But no, we wouldn't break them down.
[00:12:30] We would fly an element sometimes at two or a four ship, but the aircraft were just rotated
[00:12:34] through so you could be in any given aircraft on any day.
[00:12:37] So in a seal platoon, you could have a great officer.
[00:12:44] And you could have a great platoon.
[00:12:45] You could also have a great platoon chief or a great leading pettioser or a system platoon commander
[00:12:53] chances are you're not going to get a pipe hitting system.
[00:12:56] So you can get some really solid guys, but they just don't have to experience it.
[00:12:59] So basically what you needed was ah, ah, singular, really good leader.
[00:13:06] Didn't necessarily need to be the top guy, but somebody, you know, at a seal team, you
[00:13:11] might have a great seal team commanding officer.
[00:13:14] You also might have, and that could really make the whole seal team great.
[00:13:17] You could also have a great seal team command master chief who is a kickass guy.
[00:13:23] You could have a great seal, uh, ops master chief.
[00:13:27] So as long as you had one of these guys in the team that was legit badass, you could
[00:13:35] you're going to pull it off.
[00:13:36] Unless you get somebody that's an idiot in there too.
[00:13:38] If you get somebody with a big ego, you know, the command master chief has a big
[00:13:42] ego or the commanding officer has a big ego and also you got conflict, then you know, all
[00:13:46] bets are off and we got man.
[00:13:48] But chances are if you got one good leader, you're going to, you're going to, the, the, the
[00:13:53] group will take on the personality of the commander.
[00:13:55] So if you don't like the personality of your team, guess what?
[00:13:59] Ha, go look in the mirror.
[00:14:01] Next, counseling of individuals at the company level, the commander and the champion of
[00:14:06] the ones to whom the men will come for guidance when they have to, when they have or think
[00:14:12] they have problems.
[00:14:14] Discamanders are usually surprised, the number of men who actually have real personal difficulties.
[00:14:20] These may take a variety of forms, money troubles, family difficulties, disciplinary problems,
[00:14:25] character weaknesses and spiritual conflicts.
[00:14:28] The commander's problem is too old.
[00:14:30] First, he must train himself to recognize and to look for the early signs that identify
[00:14:34] a man with problems.
[00:14:36] Early recognition of a problem, like timely diagnosis of a disease makes the treatment and
[00:14:42] cure easier.
[00:14:45] Second, having identified the problem, the commander must take the proper steps to correct it,
[00:14:51] often his own counseling will have to be sufficient.
[00:14:54] But in other cases, he left a call on others for help.
[00:14:57] Here is the central that the correct source be used.
[00:15:00] That the man who's pay record is incorrect, shouldn't be sent to the chaplain, but to
[00:15:05] the finance clerk.
[00:15:06] All right.
[00:15:07] So we're, we're, we're making sure that we identify problems.
[00:15:10] We have to look for that.
[00:15:12] This has always been a problem for me because no one ever tells me anything when something's
[00:15:16] going wrong.
[00:15:18] No one wants to tell me that they're overworked or they don't want to do another operation
[00:15:23] or whatever.
[00:15:24] No one ever wants to tell me that.
[00:15:25] So I have to drag it out of people.
[00:15:27] I have to have intel sources that will tell me that the troops are getting tired or the
[00:15:31] guys are worn out or whatever.
[00:15:35] Recognition of outstanding work.
[00:15:36] This is the next section.
[00:15:38] Make sure way to instill loyal to you to recognize outstanding work from your subordinates.
[00:15:42] Satisfaction in a job well done as a trait of all men and recognition by others of the same
[00:15:49] good work will appeal to the vanity that lies in all of us.
[00:15:55] Another thing I'm bad at.
[00:15:58] I'm horrible at recognizing people for good work.
[00:16:01] I just think everyone's doing what they should be doing and it's very seldom that I
[00:16:08] take the time to like think somebody I usually have to think about it.
[00:16:12] I'm horrible at that.
[00:16:14] Life has told me though that when I would say something that someone did good they'd
[00:16:19] be super stoked that if we go would be fired up.
[00:16:24] Recognition can take many forms.
[00:16:25] Decorations letters of commendation or a acknowledgement of formation or the issuance
[00:16:29] of a three day pass but whatever the form is essential that the commander is a commander
[00:16:34] be alert to outstanding performance and give timely public recognition when it is due.
[00:16:38] Can I just what about just a simple head nod?
[00:16:41] Is that work?
[00:16:42] Yeah that can work man.
[00:16:43] I mean part of that is you got to pay attention to what matters to your people and you know
[00:16:48] the thing that I always craved the most the recognition.
[00:16:50] I didn't.
[00:16:51] The recognition I wanted was to be left alone and if my leadership didn't when my leadership
[00:16:57] wasn't micromanaging me and giving me the flexibility that that was him okay I must be
[00:17:02] doing something right.
[00:17:03] Cool we're good but there's nothing wrong with the recognition.
[00:17:08] I'm not trying to pile on the idea of like don't acknowledge your people's good work but
[00:17:12] what matters to somebody doesn't always matter to everybody and you got to actually pay
[00:17:16] attention what matters and over time the the head nod and keep doing what you're doing
[00:17:22] dude that's good to go.
[00:17:24] Yeah you know I had trouble with this because and I still do because you know when
[00:17:30] you're the boss right well in my mind you know if I say hey Dave good job I just I think
[00:17:38] you don't care about that because I'm just some other guy that's trying to work hard whatever
[00:17:42] and I remember I've told the story before I was first got to Ramadi needed a certain type
[00:17:48] of laptop computer for my office and the radio guy the IT guy the radio man guy who's
[00:17:55] a great dude I told him hey I need to have I need to have a zipper and a nipper laptop
[00:17:59] side by side and he's okay we don't really have enough nipper these are I need a classified
[00:18:03] computer and an unclassified computer side by side so that when I was working I could if I
[00:18:09] needed some information that was from the unclassified side I could look it up if and and
[00:18:14] then continue to work on whatever else working on.
[00:18:17] So I remember I said hey I called him into the tech operations and I said hey I want a
[00:18:23] classified computer here and an unclassified computer here and he goes well we don't really
[00:18:26] have enough unclassified computers and I kind of went okay and then a few minutes later I
[00:18:32] walked through the the chow haul and we had set up this unclassified computer station with
[00:18:38] six computers for everyone to use now everyone had computers in their tent too this wasn't
[00:18:43] like you know everyone was lined up to use these six computers no it was just somebody decided
[00:18:49] hey we'll put some internet computers out here and so I walked out there said wait a second
[00:18:52] we have all these unclassified computers right here and I went back and said hey man those
[00:18:56] computers that other get one to me and he was like oh Roger that and I realized oh I need to
[00:19:00] make the call on that and what I say has impact you know and so when you say something negative
[00:19:08] it has a big impact because you know sometimes I say that that plan doesn't make any sense
[00:19:11] and everyone just be well be quiet because they think that you don't like the plan
[00:19:15] when reality is you're just thinking maybe I could come up with a different plan so you got
[00:19:20] the overall and I wrote about this in leadership strategy tactics your words have power and
[00:19:25] impact so remembering that when you give someone some compliments it may have some it has as
[00:19:31] more significance than you might think efficiency reports I was I was thinking myself when I saw
[00:19:40] this I was like I you know I'll kind of skip over this who cares you know no one wants to hear
[00:19:43] about efficiency reports then I read it nice it oh I will absolutely include this with the
[00:19:51] advent of enlisted efficiency reports the command so efficiency reports so for in the civilian
[00:19:57] sector with the suit boiled down to you know unvaluations are performance evaluation for someone
[00:20:03] the commander now has a new tool which will assist him in gaining the desired motivation from
[00:20:08] his key enlisted personnel too often the efficiency report becomes the padlock on the barn door
[00:20:15] after the horse has been stolen what a great way to think about wasting some kind of evaluation
[00:20:23] format performance evaluation hey Dave you went and did something for a year you did your job
[00:20:28] and then you show up after a year and I say yeah you didn't do that great of a job woo what good is that
[00:20:33] the barn are the there were started got stolen I have found that unacceptable performance
[00:20:39] and the resultant bad efficiency reports can often be reduced to a minimum through early
[00:20:44] effective observation and counseling G what a novel idea when Dave starts screwing up don't wait
[00:20:53] six months to give the efficiency report say hey Dave it's been three weeks you've been on this
[00:20:57] project I already see that you're heading the wrong direction let's talk if a commander makes it a
[00:21:04] practice to observe his men closely and call them in periodically for an evaluation of their
[00:21:11] performance in terms of strengths and weaknesses he can often correct deficiencies without it
[00:21:16] becoming necessary to issue an unsatisfactory efficiency report boom it's a tool that you've got
[00:21:26] that you can use a three part program of and here's the three parts observation and evaluation
[00:21:36] counseling and guidance of the individual and individual and then further observation to determine
[00:21:41] the response to the counseling is your key to effective use of the efficiency report then it
[00:21:46] becomes a tool for improvement rather than merely a reward or punishment for past performance wow
[00:21:56] wow imagine that and it's unsap because in the navy you get an evaluation or a fitness report
[00:22:01] once a year and there's a lot of companies that we work with that do something similar there's
[00:22:08] that's just not often it's not often enough it's not even close and those periodic
[00:22:15] evaluations they actually don't even need to be that formal it's really just the core of building
[00:22:20] relationships is getting to know your people by being out with them the best thing you can do is
[00:22:24] know your people well enough to be able to recognize when they're going in the wrong direction
[00:22:29] and if you talk to your people once a year you're not going to know that because you don't even know
[00:22:33] what their typically like and so if I'm working with you and and I know Jaco pretty well and all
[00:22:37] of a sudden Jaco shows up one day and he's not Jaco I can get involved right then but the only way
[00:22:42] for me to tell that you're not yourself or not doing the things that I'm used to is I got to be
[00:22:48] around you just a little bit more and you don't need to track all this stuff every single time you don't
[00:22:51] need to know the formal piece of it and formal counseling is important but the best tool you've
[00:22:57] got is actually know them well enough to go something's not right and if you can intercept that
[00:23:01] on day one rather than day 30 or 60 or 90 not only do you actually help solve that problem that
[00:23:08] other person recognizes that you know and care about them enough to get involved and being able to
[00:23:14] do that is really a function of your time more than anything else of being around your people to
[00:23:19] know them well enough to identify that when they're off the path so it comes down as high
[00:23:24] management when I talk about planning and I say okay if I give Dave a mission tasking and say okay
[00:23:31] Dave come up with a plan and how you want to do this if I leave for 12 hours and you were 3
[00:23:37] degrees off and you're what you thought you should do versus what I thought you should do I come
[00:23:40] back 12 hours there's 12 hours of wasted time because you've been going on on the wrong direction
[00:23:44] and now you're way off course if I go hey Dave here's the here's the mission you need to
[00:23:49] execute here's the task come up with your you know some connoffs I'll be back in a half an hour
[00:23:54] your 3 degrees off it oh I barely even takes a nudge to get you right back on track and we're we're
[00:24:00] tracking so the earlier you give people corrective measures the the the minimum the the the limit
[00:24:09] of what you have to do to get them back on course is is totally limited it's the minimum
[00:24:14] workforce required so if you and I if I said hey Dave here's a mission tasking come up with how
[00:24:21] you want to do I'll be back in half an hour when I came back in a half an hour and you're 3 degrees
[00:24:25] off course I barely I probably would be able to get you back on course by asking you will
[00:24:31] not even tell me anything just by saying hey what do you think about what do you think about
[00:24:35] this area up to the north do you think that's a you think there could be enemy up there
[00:24:39] that's kind of what the intel says right and you say yeah and I'd say oh
[00:24:42] are you gonna put a blocking force up there you didn't have a blocking force in your plan
[00:24:47] you go yes absolutely and cool now we're totally square yeah if I walk away for 12 hours
[00:24:52] and let you come up with a plan you're wide open to the enemy attack from the north you have
[00:24:57] you use your blocking force in a totally different area you don't even have enough people now
[00:25:01] because you so it's just it's totally wrong and now we got to come in with blunt force trauma
[00:25:06] and now it's not your planning anymore you've given up on a ship it's just it's just a nightmare
[00:25:09] it's crazy so the earlier I get involved the less force I have to use and my goal is the
[00:25:15] leaders to use the minimum force required and the longer I wait to use force but worse it's
[00:25:19] gonna be and if you're out there thinking about the time the the daunting task of spending
[00:25:27] all that time up front the ROI on your investment of time of front is is it's it's unlimited
[00:25:34] because if you make that investment up front which seems like a lot of time what you save on the back
[00:25:40] end of that so from the time manager standpoint yes yes it is an additional investment of a
[00:25:45] little bit of time upfront it is and you got to account for that time that is not free time
[00:25:49] but what you save from that ROI all day all day it's not even close and you know what is funny
[00:25:56] is you you're I disagree with you because you say it's this big investment up front it's not
[00:26:00] so low investment up front it's me going hey Dave how are you gonna execute this and you go
[00:26:04] all my do it like this and I go oh don't forget there's enemy up there you are I'm gonna put
[00:26:07] a blocking for sure okay cool there we go that's how that was it that took 18s that's the story we tell
[00:26:11] ourselves like hey I can't come back in 30 minutes because you actually can't you're absolutely right
[00:26:16] and it's the idea of whatever it seems like I don't have time a you do have time and if you do
[00:26:21] need to do some mental calculation of that time the ROI in that time is well worth whatever
[00:26:27] you might miss for that five minute check-in that happens up front and it also shows another person oh
[00:26:33] joccal care joccal is in the game joccal is paying attention I wonder if that means I'm gonna be more
[00:26:38] or less interested in giving you a really good plan if I know you care about it you know it's
[00:26:43] interesting too ROI the ROI on time is that it doesn't even make sense and I'll tell you why
[00:26:53] because I don't get that time back if you're supposed to execute a mission tonight and I give you
[00:26:58] 12 hours to plan and I go hey here's the mission you got to execute and I don't come back and check in
[00:27:04] by the time 12 hours go by and I realize that your plan is a total disaster it's not that the ROI
[00:27:10] it's not I don't get return on my investment it's that we it's that it's it's bankrupt so it's total failure
[00:27:17] it's total in complete failure I can't even get it back the ROI is negative it's it's horrible
[00:27:22] where as a little investment upfront total gain changer totally now here's another section I wasn't
[00:27:30] gonna read and I remember I I sent you a picture of this book or sections of the book and you you said
[00:27:36] just read the whole just you're gonna just cover the whole thing yeah and I was kind of like yeah you
[00:27:40] know that's cool I'm sure I'll cover a lot of it but you know I'm always I don't want to waste people's
[00:27:44] time so I'm looking for okay what can we streamline a little bit so there's this section called
[00:27:48] promotion then look if you're in the civilian world how much do you care about how they advance
[00:27:53] people in the army in 1952 right whatever and then I read it a little bit okay well looks like we're
[00:28:00] covering this too and I'll tell you how it a second so it says promotion the promotion policy of a
[00:28:05] commanders of a command has a strong bearing on morale and overall efficiency it must be fair
[00:28:11] and by the way this is one thing that you're gonna start to pick up in this section of the book
[00:28:16] and in some of the other sections there is absolutely part of general clerk that is looking to get promoted
[00:28:24] and he you can feel it and there's gonna be other places where you feel it and what's cool is
[00:28:29] you'll feel it and he'll say it and then a little later on he'll he'll hint that you know what that
[00:28:37] doesn't really even matter so we're gonna go back and forth we're gonna come up with some of these
[00:28:41] things where you say okay he's a he's a guy that really cares that's in the game just to get promoted
[00:28:48] right which I am not a big proponent of hey your main reason to be in the game is get promoted that being said
[00:28:56] if I have got a team and I want to take care of my team well how do I how do I do the best job
[00:29:03] take my care of my team I get promoted so I have more leverage and more power and I can be positive
[00:29:07] influence on even more people so getting promoted if you're getting promoted for yourself
[00:29:14] we don't like that and by the way when I say we I'm talking about the people that work for you
[00:29:20] if you're getting promoted for yourself they don't like it we don't like that but if you're
[00:29:25] getting promoted so that you can help the team achieve their mission protect the team take care of
[00:29:31] the team grow the team influence the team in a positive way if that's why you're getting promoted
[00:29:37] cool good on you good we we like that you're doing it for the right reasons and if you think if you
[00:29:44] think if you think you can sneak around and get promoted for yourself but you don't really be
[00:29:49] to I promise in you I promise you everybody sees it so promotion it must be fair
[00:29:58] buy it the commander can encourage men to develop themselves for permissions for positions of
[00:30:03] supervision and leadership the commander should consider the following qualifications and attributes
[00:30:10] when considering a man for promotion so he goes into a list and what I did and what I wrote down here
[00:30:15] was when I go through this list aim the aim this list at yourself you aim this list at yourself
[00:30:25] are you promoteable number one reliability number one reliability when when I talk about relationships
[00:30:44] I use the word relationships I'm really talking about trust and trust if you don't have trust
[00:30:52] inside of a team all those lost well yeah so the question is how do you build trust well let me
[00:30:59] give you a good hint the number one clue right here be reliable be reliable okay so that's number one
[00:31:05] number two his knowledge of his present job and his preparation for the next higher one so be
[00:31:12] knowledgeable proficiency text test scores leadership can he direct men
[00:31:17] ability to organize and manage a job okay these are all things if you aim these things at
[00:31:25] yourself it is a powerful thing to think about knowledge to detect and courage to correct errors
[00:31:34] in subordinates initiative does he perform well without close supervision appearance military
[00:31:43] courtesy and neatness this makes me happy that I wrote the warrior kid books
[00:31:52] maintenance of equipment individual and organizational attitude loyalty enthusiasm
[00:31:57] ability as an instructor ability as an instructor and I'll tell you what I've been thinking
[00:32:04] about and there's a couple of the things that we'll clue in on this we've been talking we've been
[00:32:09] developing leadership certification program at echelom front and one of the things that we've been
[00:32:17] dancing around is the fact that there's there's maybe well we we were dancing around with like
[00:32:26] two different pipelines like you're either a trainer that's going to train people how to lead
[00:32:30] or your leader and you're in a supervisor position and your management position and your leader
[00:32:34] and then we've kind of got into a point where we say listen these are the same thing and in
[00:32:40] order to become a good leader you have to be able to teach you have to be able to show people how to
[00:32:47] do things so it's interesting that he's got ability as an instructor because listen if I'm going
[00:32:54] to promote you Dave from you know from being in charge of a squad to being in charge of a tune
[00:32:59] I want you to be able to teach I want you to be able to instruct that is absolutely important
[00:33:04] and and in a leadership environment i want you to be able to teach the team about leadership.
[00:33:09] I want you to be able to teach when I put you in charge of a tune I want you to be able to teach
[00:33:13] your squad leaders how to lead. I want you to be able to teach your fire team leaders how to lead
[00:33:19] and I also want you to be able to teach them how to break down a 240g. I want you to be able
[00:33:24] to teach us gesagt so the ability to be an instructor is important and it's equally important
[00:33:29] because when we teach, we learn.
[00:33:32] Yeah.
[00:33:33] That second point was what I was thinking in my head a lot is, you know, top gun for
[00:33:39] my community is kind of the apex of instruction.
[00:33:42] You know, the quality of instruction is is kind of at its peak there because you
[00:33:48] get to focus just on that.
[00:33:49] You don't have all these other distractions going on so you focus on that.
[00:33:52] I learned more there than I did anywhere else.
[00:33:55] And the ability to teach is really comes from how much you truly understand something.
[00:34:02] And for me, being able to fly an airplane or run the radar or manage the systems, a lot
[00:34:07] of people can do that.
[00:34:09] But when you try to teach something, it exposes your gaps in knowledge.
[00:34:15] And a good teacher, when they break down what they're going to teach, they recognize,
[00:34:19] oh, I don't actually understand this very well.
[00:34:22] So before I teach it to you, I get to go learn about this more.
[00:34:25] So the learning connected to the teaching, I learned more because my obligation was to teach
[00:34:31] it.
[00:34:32] And as I'm learning to teach, expose all the things I didn't know.
[00:34:35] So a good teacher actually has to understand it better than anybody else.
[00:34:39] And that connection between those two is so critical.
[00:34:41] And the idea of teaching is I think a reflection or anything of how well you truly know
[00:34:47] something.
[00:34:48] And you don't really test yourself and how well you know it until you have to explain
[00:34:51] it to somebody else.
[00:34:52] Yeah.
[00:34:53] So I started, I just wrote down, you know, I hope he's about to say that as you teach
[00:34:58] you learn.
[00:34:59] And that's exactly what you said.
[00:35:01] You identify the gaps in your own knowledge and you go, okay, better figure this out.
[00:35:05] A better go run the stroke.
[00:35:06] I better pull the thread on that until I understand it better.
[00:35:10] Next participation in unit and community activities does he use his time off to improve
[00:35:15] himself.
[00:35:18] Aim that one at yourself.
[00:35:21] Is he a good soldier all the time?
[00:35:25] Is the job he has charged with being done better now than it was when he took over?
[00:35:31] Judgment in common sense, a good scale of values, ability to receive and carry out instructions
[00:35:38] has he been efficiently filling his grade position, accident record, incident record,
[00:35:44] a wall in article 15, which means it has the dude gotten in trouble before.
[00:35:49] Really powerful list, there may be other considerations.
[00:35:52] They should add up to confidence that the man will play as part well under any conditions
[00:35:57] especially in unusual situations.
[00:36:04] What's interesting about that?
[00:36:05] Why does that make me think awesome thoughts?
[00:36:12] Because what that says is that this military guy who believes in discipline and believes
[00:36:18] in being able to do your job and being able to receive and carry out instructions, that's
[00:36:23] what he said.
[00:36:25] He wants you to be especially able to perform in unusual situations.
[00:36:30] How do you get good at performing on unusual situations?
[00:36:35] You get tested, you get tasked, you get things thrown at you and you have to use your mind.
[00:36:42] It's great that you have the ability to receive and carry out instructions.
[00:36:45] This is my point.
[00:36:46] Think that you have the ability to receive and carry out instructions.
[00:36:50] That's great.
[00:36:51] But if I throw something in usual at you and what you have to do is figure it out and you
[00:36:55] don't know how to do that, we got it all proble.
[00:37:01] Unless you want him as a member of your team do not promote him or recommend him for
[00:37:05] promotion.
[00:37:06] The promotion policy of a unit commander should be published and understood by all.
[00:37:12] Then it goes through this next section, elimination of ineffective personnel.
[00:37:17] Like automatorship, when the higher one the fire, when a mentor will wind the fire.
[00:37:21] It is the commander's duty to contribute to raising the standards of the United States
[00:37:27] Army.
[00:37:28] What a beast statement that is.
[00:37:31] It is that commander's duty to contribute to raising the standards of the United States
[00:37:36] Army.
[00:37:38] I want to approach this goal is a continuous evaluation of his personnel.
[00:37:43] Officers, non-commission officers and enlisted men like.
[00:37:46] When ineptness is revealed or continuing ineffectiveness is detected in officers and non-commission
[00:37:52] officers, it is the commander's duty to see that corrective measures are taken elimination
[00:38:00] or reduction in grade as appropriate.
[00:38:04] So you have done your escalation of counseling, I have done everything I can to achieve
[00:38:09] if I can straighten Dave Burke out, he can't make it happen.
[00:38:12] Dave Burke needs to go bye-bye.
[00:38:18] The importance of a good but fair reduction policy is often overlooked.
[00:38:23] Few things disrupt the unit more than the presence of inefficient leaders.
[00:38:28] G.
[00:38:33] That comes as a big shock.
[00:38:34] Few things disrupt the unit more than the presence of inefficient leaders.
[00:38:37] So let's think about this.
[00:38:39] If Dave's working for me and Dave is inefficient and Dave doesn't do a good job and Dave
[00:38:43] drops the ball and Dave's working for me and I continue to allow Dave to be there.
[00:38:49] What does the team think of him?
[00:38:50] What does it say about you as a leader?
[00:38:52] It says I suck as a leader.
[00:38:55] That's what it says.
[00:38:56] Or it says that you don't actually care because this leader this day that's underperforming,
[00:39:01] who is he actually affecting?
[00:39:03] He's affecting the whole team and you know, a synonym for that reduction rank is that's
[00:39:09] rank is essentially responsibility.
[00:39:11] So as your rank grows in the military, you know, responsibility grows.
[00:39:14] So you don't have to have a ranking structure in your organization.
[00:39:16] You've got responsibility for, you know, this guy is a team leader or supervisor or impact
[00:39:21] the team.
[00:39:22] This guy's underperformance that you tolerate.
[00:39:24] Doesn't just affect this underperformance.
[00:39:25] It's all the people in his influence and they're looking at you saying this is what
[00:39:30] Jocca was going to put up with this is the bar that he's going to tolerate and he'll
[00:39:33] by the way, this affects me personally and just like on the other extreme of getting rid
[00:39:39] of people way too soon, way too premature that you haven't invested in, keeping the wrong
[00:39:44] people around in terms of what that does to your leadership capital.
[00:39:54] Regulations provide for the reduction of enlisted men and the separation of officers
[00:39:58] for an inefficiency and actual performance of their job or as a result of misconduct.
[00:40:04] The latter is where where we fall most often.
[00:40:08] We fail, or sorry, the latter is where we fail most often.
[00:40:11] We fail because we do not face up to the fact that key personnel to be good leaders of
[00:40:17] young men must also have good character.
[00:40:23] More character will inevitably manifest itself in poor conduct, leaders influence the actions
[00:40:29] of their subordinates.
[00:40:31] Most leaders are considered by those of less rank as highly qualified and competent.
[00:40:37] Therefore, when poor conduct is manifested off duty by anyone in leadership capacity, it
[00:40:42] has a detrimental effect on the entire unit.
[00:40:46] Especially dangerous in this regard are those key personnel who are outstanding in their
[00:40:51] work.
[00:40:53] Or their influence is even greater on troops who, observing them, will often emulate their
[00:40:59] actions even to the point of delinquency.
[00:41:02] If this condition persists, it can lead to a broken breakdown of discipline throughout
[00:41:07] the unit in an incredibly short time.
[00:41:10] Leaders with character deficiencies, regardless of how good they might appear in field training,
[00:41:16] or a luxury we cannot afford.
[00:41:23] Would you write down?
[00:41:24] I wrote down character and conduct.
[00:41:30] I was thinking as you are reading this, you cannot, and I learned this in the Marine Corps.
[00:41:36] You cannot separate your work life from some other part of your life.
[00:41:40] If you were a leader, you are committed to being a leader all the time.
[00:41:46] Where you are scrutinized, the most risk is how you act off the clock, if you want to call
[00:41:53] that.
[00:41:54] I can stand up in front of my Marines and tell them all the things I expect from them.
[00:41:58] Whatever those might be, I can make a list that are all good and I could behave like that
[00:42:01] at work.
[00:42:02] If I go out and down or back in my personal life, anywhere else outside of work, and I reveal
[00:42:07] that I don't live by the expectations I set for my people.
[00:42:10] My character is revealed that I don't actually apply those to myself.
[00:42:14] The degree to which that undermines me as a leader at work is actually much worse than
[00:42:19] if I just wasn't great at work and I'm just working on it and trying to get better.
[00:42:23] Your character, your character, sooner or later, is going to be revealed.
[00:42:30] Because you're going to find yourself in a place where you think nobody is looking,
[00:42:32] you're going to find yourself in an environment where you think it's okay and who you are
[00:42:36] is going to come out.
[00:42:38] He said, I wish I wrote an exact what his character will be connected to your conduct.
[00:42:43] Who you really are eventually is going to influence how you behave?
[00:42:49] If your plan is to put on a good front at work, you're going to get found out and the damage
[00:42:54] to that your credibility and the damage to the team, if that's, that you just simply cannot
[00:43:00] separate who you are as a leader and have a period of time or a place where you don't have
[00:43:05] to hold yourself to that same standard.
[00:43:07] That's what I wrote down when you were talking was, hey, you can try and put up
[00:43:13] that front, you already said, well, you try and put up that front.
[00:43:16] If you and your mind and your little tiny brain, because it is tiny, if this is what you think
[00:43:21] you have a small brain.
[00:43:23] If in your brain, your tiny little brain you think it doesn't really matter no one will
[00:43:26] notice your brain is small and you are stupid because everybody sees that, everybody.
[00:43:33] And everybody is watching you all the time.
[00:43:37] They're watching you.
[00:43:38] They see you all the time.
[00:43:42] Easy.
[00:43:44] While the commander should place heavy emphasis on re-enlistment and do all in his power
[00:43:48] to retain effective personnel, he should bear in mind that the army wants quality not
[00:43:52] quantity, make your program selective.
[00:43:56] Social life, every army post should be close, net, happy family.
[00:43:59] Commanders can foster this by ensuring that families of their men have adequate social life.
[00:44:05] A particular importance is the inclusion of youth activities designed, especially for youth
[00:44:09] and not for adults, good programs in this field will not just happen, they will require
[00:44:13] your best people.
[00:44:18] You know when you start looking at building what you just said, you know, how do you expect
[00:44:24] the people to act if you haven't given them a good support structure with their family?
[00:44:30] Just doesn't work.
[00:44:32] It is essential that all recommendations he talks about this non-commissioned officers
[00:44:35] advisory council, which is, hey, you've got to, you've got to, you can, you can
[00:44:39] have a symbol groups of your workers, of your team, of your employees, the leaders, the
[00:44:45] frontline troops, you can assemble groups of them and get feedback from them.
[00:44:51] And he says it's essential that all recommendations receive the attention of the major
[00:44:54] commander concerned for failure to act on justified recommendations will defeat the whole
[00:44:59] purpose of having these councils.
[00:45:04] And you know, it's interesting we've been doing some work at echelon front with some of these
[00:45:08] councils, which is always cool because now you're getting people from different, different
[00:45:15] cross sections of the company that are sort of these councils and that's been interesting.
[00:45:19] It's been very interesting.
[00:45:20] And it's kind of what we do anyways when we go into a company, we, you know, we get
[00:45:26] a cross section, but it's nice when the companies already have a cross section that we are
[00:45:29] talking to.
[00:45:30] So, if you're running a company right now or if you're in a company right now, it's
[00:45:35] a good idea to think about putting together some kind of a council where you say, hey,
[00:45:39] we need to take the best ideas, take the best practices, take the grievances that we have,
[00:45:44] assemble them together in a logical way to push them up the chain of command because if the,
[00:45:48] if the boss, you know, has us work and laid every Friday and the boss doesn't know how much
[00:45:52] that negatively impacts us, how can we expect them to change it?
[00:45:57] Answer, we cannot get together.
[00:46:00] Put forth information in a consolidated effort so that the boss knows what's happening.
[00:46:09] And if you're the boss and you get that feedback, implement as best you can act on it.
[00:46:15] Yeah.
[00:46:16] Direction staffs, the staff is no more than an extension of the commander's abilities and
[00:46:20] a good commander must be able to handle the staff property.
[00:46:23] Officers of a staff should carry out the commander's policies enthusiastically by the same
[00:46:27] token.
[00:46:29] They should bring to the attention of the commander, those matters deserving his personal
[00:46:34] attention.
[00:46:38] Staff visits to make sound decisions the commander must receive timely and reliable reports from
[00:46:47] his staff, which means that his staff must visit unit activities.
[00:46:53] So talk to us, Dave, about what they're talking about when they say staff.
[00:47:01] So like when I was a commander of a unit, my staff, I had, I had subordinate leaders that
[00:47:09] were responsible for different elements.
[00:47:11] So I'd have like an operation staff that ran the operations.
[00:47:14] I have a maintenance staff that ran the maintenance and logistics and supply and all the
[00:47:17] different components.
[00:47:18] And I would underneath these leaders, which were really staff officers kind of building the
[00:47:23] plans were a whole bunch of people implementing their processes or their SOPs or whatever
[00:47:28] they created.
[00:47:29] If you got a staff officer, someone working for you that has a plan and has their team implementing
[00:47:33] the plan out in the field or out on the flight line.
[00:47:36] And they don't go out there to see how effective it is, what the real barriers are, what
[00:47:41] the problems are, and they are sort of operating in that vacuum of their staff position
[00:47:45] or in their cubicle their office.
[00:47:48] And they're out out there with those people.
[00:47:49] They have no sense of the real feedback of the problems and the challenges that people
[00:47:54] facing while they're implementing their plans.
[00:47:57] And so it comes, I think it's as simple as what you described.
[00:48:01] I think you said it like in the first pages, leave your office and go out and spend time
[00:48:05] with your people to see what's really going on down there.
[00:48:07] But what if seven years ago I had that job and I kind of remember what it was like back
[00:48:10] then?
[00:48:11] Is that good?
[00:48:12] Is that a cover of me?
[00:48:14] No.
[00:48:16] The, it also is just the connection to having your people see that you're willing to go out
[00:48:23] there and just spend time with them.
[00:48:25] The benefit of spending time with your people.
[00:48:28] On one sense it's actually really important and we can talk about all the different things
[00:48:32] that I would learn when I just spent time with my people.
[00:48:34] I learned about things.
[00:48:35] I learned how things worked.
[00:48:36] I learned the challenges they had.
[00:48:38] But there is a matter, there is some level of effort that it takes for you to get away
[00:48:42] from your desk as a leader to go spend time with your people.
[00:48:45] And most of the time your troops actually understand that.
[00:48:48] They know it's not as simple for the CEO to just get away.
[00:48:51] So when you do the power of, of you doing that on, is really significant.
[00:48:56] They recognize that you're making the effort to do it.
[00:48:59] If your plan is to do, we call these touch and go, I had to go out there and show your
[00:49:03] face to the team.
[00:49:04] If that's your kind of like, hey, I'm going to show my face and you don't actually get
[00:49:08] out spend time with them, they're going to see that coming in my way.
[00:49:10] But if you just spend a little time, what you'll end up getting is a bunch of unfiltered
[00:49:14] feedback that didn't run through the chain and get chopped by all your staff, although
[00:49:18] we have to you, you get unfiltered.
[00:49:19] Get sterilized totally.
[00:49:21] You know what, what you want more than anything, you want a 19 year old Lance Corporal
[00:49:26] who is turning a wrench on a jet to explain to you why this is hard.
[00:49:32] Now, of course, you want to use the chain to come in.
[00:49:34] I want that to run through the chain.
[00:49:36] I want to see that multiple ways.
[00:49:38] But if you want unfiltered feedback to which really going on with your team, you have to
[00:49:42] get down to spend time with your team.
[00:49:48] That being said, back to the book.
[00:49:49] It is essential, however, that a staff officer making such visits understands the thin
[00:49:54] line that divides staff supervision from metal some interference.
[00:50:01] So there's the dichotomy of leadership.
[00:50:02] He'll be jumping the chain.
[00:50:03] He must realize that he is not a commander.
[00:50:08] He should avoid criticizing subordinate commanders and report and said they're shortcomings.
[00:50:12] Two is commander and should you see that his reports reflect favorably as well as unfavorable
[00:50:18] conditions.
[00:50:19] So you've got to make sure that you're not just being a rat going out there.
[00:50:22] And you've got to make sure that you don't interfere.
[00:50:26] It can cause interference.
[00:50:28] If Dave, you're having a meeting at S.L.M.
[00:50:31] front and you've got all the instructors because you want to cover some L-dap information
[00:50:37] and you're doing a Zoom meeting and you're going to talk shop about a bunch of different
[00:50:40] things and all of a sudden I just pop in there.
[00:50:43] Well, you know, what am I doing in there?
[00:50:45] And you had a agenda and all of a sudden I'm in there.
[00:50:47] There's times where I'm just causing interference.
[00:50:52] And that's really not what we're looking to do.
[00:50:56] Now all that being said, go ahead.
[00:50:59] I was just going to say, especially as I got more senior when I was in charge of an entire
[00:51:03] squadron.
[00:51:05] My bias was actually towards trying to spend time.
[00:51:09] And my bias was towards normalizing the review of me as a person.
[00:51:13] And let me just explain that for a minute.
[00:51:15] Every single person in the squadron knew who the squadron commander was.
[00:51:19] Everybody from the next the next in command to me, my number two guy, all the way down
[00:51:23] to the most my most junior marine.
[00:51:25] And if I did nothing, the natural state would be for them to put almost put me in
[00:51:31] a pedestal.
[00:51:32] Now they couldn't even relate to me as a person.
[00:51:35] Along with that, I really didn't have a lot of time.
[00:51:39] I was busy doing a lot of things, especially dealing with higher headquarters and other
[00:51:43] components.
[00:51:44] So I didn't have all day every day.
[00:51:45] So the times that I was out there was rare because I'd simply had a lot going on.
[00:51:50] So my bias and I'm talking the needle a little bit off center.
[00:51:53] My bias was if I could spend a little more time and set up a little less time, if I could
[00:51:57] get a little more understanding what's going on, then a little less, that was my bias.
[00:52:02] Because the natural tendency for most people would almost put a commander on a pedestal.
[00:52:09] It's not even a person.
[00:52:11] He's elevated to a status, it's almost unrelatable.
[00:52:15] And if I could create just a little bit of falling of, hey, I'm a normal person.
[00:52:19] I really want to know what's going on in here.
[00:52:20] I really want to have some connection on what you're doing.
[00:52:23] I would bias towards that.
[00:52:24] There were so many other forces at play.
[00:52:26] There was very little risk of me being the type of guy that I'm just hanging out, I hate
[00:52:30] what's going on down here.
[00:52:31] How's your boss and what?
[00:52:33] So the risk of there was lower, the other point, I think that point is totally valid.
[00:52:37] And the reason I'm making mention of this is that at least in the military, the chain
[00:52:41] of command is understood.
[00:52:44] And the barrier for me was that being so rigid that people didn't see me as a person who
[00:52:49] really want to know what's going on.
[00:52:51] So I would bias in that direction as if I was splitting the difference when what I was
[00:52:55] going to do, I would try to spend more time than less.
[00:52:59] If you're not seen as a human being, you don't have connections with the troops, if you
[00:53:03] don't have connections with the troops, none of this, none of it, nothing that we're talking
[00:53:07] about even matters, anyway, shape or form basically.
[00:53:10] Basically, you've got to be a person.
[00:53:16] The question of visitors, back to the book, a commander can expect many inspectors and visitors
[00:53:21] and it should be his policy to encourage and welcome visits and import from important
[00:53:26] officials.
[00:53:27] This of course means that his house must be constantly kept in order.
[00:53:32] That is how it should be for the unit that is uniformly excellent in all things that
[00:53:37] all times is one that will be outstanding in battle.
[00:53:42] Look upon visitors not as interruptions or harassment, but as the chance to show the public
[00:53:49] just how really good your unit is.
[00:53:52] That's pretty epic, dude.
[00:53:54] That is so important.
[00:53:55] I keep coming back to my time as a squadron commander, because when I commanded a unit,
[00:54:00] it was the very first operational F-35 B squadron in the world.
[00:54:04] It was the focal point of all things marine aviation.
[00:54:08] It was a under emichor scope, and we had visitors all the time.
[00:54:15] Everything from US senators, four star generals, local congressmen, everybody wanted, there's
[00:54:21] a massive investment in time and they wanted to know what was going on.
[00:54:24] There's a propensity towards when we get a note, hey, you're getting a notification, you're
[00:54:29] getting this delegation's coming to visit.
[00:54:31] They would focus their time on his preparing for that visit.
[00:54:35] I wanted no time spent on preparation for the visit.
[00:54:39] We're not going to clean the floors.
[00:54:42] We're going to operate as normal.
[00:54:43] I want them to come down and see, and if you are actually at that square to a unit, you
[00:54:47] don't need to prepare for those visits.
[00:54:50] If your plan is, oh, they're coming, hey, everybody started cleaning up.
[00:54:53] Shot in your boots and empty and trash cans and cleaning the tops of doors that you
[00:54:57] things you would not normally do.
[00:55:00] My view on visits was they can show up any place, any time, anywhere with no notice.
[00:55:05] I don't care.
[00:55:06] If I'm not there, no factor.
[00:55:07] Somebody will cover down.
[00:55:08] Staff Sergeant will cover down, Lieutenant, I don't care.
[00:55:12] The message that sent to the Marines was twofold.
[00:55:14] As one is hit the boss, doesn't freak out when people come to visit.
[00:55:17] It's no big deal.
[00:55:18] If we're actually a square to waste with, think we are, who cares?
[00:55:21] Show up, come check it out.
[00:55:22] You're going to see what you're going to see is the best squadron in the world.
[00:55:25] That's what you're going to see.
[00:55:26] So no factor.
[00:55:27] Visits are not a big deal.
[00:55:29] Check, unit athletic programs, athletic programs developed in conjunction with the physical
[00:55:37] fitness program.
[00:55:38] We'll do much to enhance the physical stamina of unit.
[00:55:41] Why do I cover this?
[00:55:43] Why do I, why don't I even cover this?
[00:55:45] Well, because it's true.
[00:55:47] Well, because if we're out there, so focused on leadership that we don't, we let our
[00:55:52] physical bodies fall apart, we're wrong.
[00:55:57] And he knows that an active, an active interest in athletics is provided by the commander
[00:56:02] through proper motivation and personal interest.
[00:56:06] A well-planned and integrated athletic program is an important part of any unit training
[00:56:11] program.
[00:56:12] It will take the minds of the men off what some of them consider as the monotony of training.
[00:56:19] We'll keep the command and better physical shape, help build a unit, a speed of core, help
[00:56:24] develop self-discipline and team spirit.
[00:56:32] Man, we get away from that.
[00:56:34] Emphasis in athletic programs should be on the small unit level, such as company battery
[00:56:39] troop rather than at higher levels.
[00:56:42] So look, I don't know what situation you're in in life or what your business is doing,
[00:56:48] but doing something physical together is very, very helpful.
[00:56:55] Anybody that's ever done an FTAx with echelon front, it was exactly what you're talking.
[00:56:59] Yeah, even come to the master.
[00:57:01] Come to the master and come do PT at the master and you're doing something that's hard,
[00:57:06] but it's fun and we're having a good time.
[00:57:09] We're doing them, by the way, we're doing the master December 4th and 5th.
[00:57:14] No, December 3rd and 4th in Texas.
[00:57:17] And we're still going to do PT, we're not quite figured out what we're doing instead
[00:57:21] of due jutsu on the closing night, but we're going to figure something awesome out.
[00:57:25] But why?
[00:57:27] Why do we do that?
[00:57:28] Because people feel better.
[00:57:30] It brings the, look, people that will have thousand people there, well, for the
[00:57:34] master in the next master, we want to have thousand people there.
[00:57:37] We'll probably have a third of that or maybe half that.
[00:57:42] But people from all over the country will get together.
[00:57:44] They've never met before and they will bond in 45 minutes of early morning PT.
[00:57:50] If you get up at five in the morning and PT, you'll be less tired than if you got up
[00:57:54] at seven in the morning and went straight to the conference room.
[00:57:56] You'll be less tired.
[00:57:58] Stopped at the donut factory.
[00:58:01] So he talks about attractive living areas, you know, providing people a good place to live.
[00:58:06] Well, that applies with applying, supplying people to good place to work.
[00:58:14] Maintenance and supply economy.
[00:58:16] You'll recall that on the subject of training habits, I said that men will do in combat.
[00:58:21] What they have been taught and practice in training.
[00:58:24] This is equally true in the area of maintenance.
[00:58:27] For in combat, high maintenance standards become a matter of life and death of equal
[00:58:32] significance is supply economy.
[00:58:35] That wasted bullet or gallon of gas may seem insignificant now, but what a difference
[00:58:41] it may make when the chips are down exclamation point.
[00:58:45] I think that's the only exclamation point.
[00:58:46] He uses in this book.
[00:58:50] You train how you fight and if you're allowed to be sloppy or cut corners and not do the
[00:58:56] maintenance, where you're going to end up in a bad way.
[00:59:02] Good leadership on the company level can only thrive in a climate of good commander ship
[00:59:08] on the battalion level and above.
[00:59:12] What company commanders have a right to expect from commanders above?
[00:59:18] So here, look, if you're working, if you're a boss, this is what you should be providing
[00:59:23] to the people below you.
[00:59:25] That their honest errors be pointed out, but be underwritten at least once in the interest
[00:59:31] of developing initiative and leadership.
[00:59:34] Boom.
[00:59:35] What does that mean?
[00:59:36] It means if someone makes mistake one time, you don't drop the hammer on them, you
[00:59:42] show them support that they had initiative, that they showed good leadership.
[00:59:47] So that's what we're supposed to point them out.
[00:59:50] Hey Dave, bad initiative or good initiative, bad judgment.
[00:59:54] You know, I like that you took action, but let's think through the action that you
[00:59:59] took.
[01:00:00] That's fine.
[01:00:01] To be responsible for and be allowed to develop their own units with only essential guidance
[01:00:08] from above.
[01:00:12] You are responsible for developing, however you want to do it, Dave, you got your team,
[01:00:18] however you want to develop that team.
[01:00:20] Here's the minimum requirements and this is the mission.
[01:00:25] Only the essential guidance.
[01:00:26] What do we say?
[01:00:27] We say minimum force required.
[01:00:29] We want to lead with a minimum force required.
[01:00:32] A helpful attitude toward their problems, loyalty down as well as up, that they not be subjected
[01:00:40] to the needling of unproductive statistics, competitions between like units, just harassing
[01:00:49] people, the best in command or ship, that the needs of their units be anticipated and provided
[01:00:56] for.
[01:00:57] That's not too much to ask that I anticipate that Dave's going to need more bullets or
[01:01:01] more ammunition or more fuel.
[01:01:04] And I have it for him to be kept oriented as to the mission and situation of the unit
[01:01:10] above, well, fought out program of training, work and recreation, good training and work
[01:01:16] management to receive timely, clear cut and positive orders and decisions which are not
[01:01:21] constantly changed.
[01:01:26] The integrity of their tactical units be maintained in assigning essential tasks.
[01:01:32] That was so smart.
[01:01:35] That was a little trick that I did.
[01:01:37] I would keep my little fire teams together, keep the squad together as much as I could
[01:01:40] I could keep the platoon together as much as I could look.
[01:01:42] We were interoperable.
[01:01:43] But if you can keep a fire team together, they are so good to go.
[01:01:48] You want them tied.
[01:01:50] You think a couple of them you said anticipate the needs of their units be anticipated and
[01:01:58] provided for them.
[01:01:59] Think about that word though that the needs are anticipated.
[01:02:02] That is a real word in there.
[01:02:03] That is not, I'm here.
[01:02:05] Hey, when you run out of stuff, come up and tell me, hey, and you run it through the
[01:02:07] chain and command and give me the the triple kit paperwork to give you what you need.
[01:02:11] It's me knowing what's going on down there and going, hey, Jocco, you're the team
[01:02:13] who have been getting after it man.
[01:02:15] How's your stash of this supplier?
[01:02:17] How's this going on here?
[01:02:18] Are you running low?
[01:02:19] Work in this not to get this to you and you're thinking damn.
[01:02:23] He didn't just cut us loose.
[01:02:25] He's actually paying attention when it's going on down here and I was about to send up
[01:02:28] the request but I don't like asking my boss for stuff so I was kind of worried about
[01:02:32] asking him and he's thinking, I've noticed you guys have been cranking, do you need some
[01:02:36] of this?
[01:02:37] You're anticipating the needs.
[01:02:38] Not just responding to their needs but actually thinking about it.
[01:02:42] I mean, you want to talk about being a commander, being a leader, knowing what your people
[01:02:46] are going through and giving them what they need before they have to ask for it.
[01:02:49] That word is no small word.
[01:02:51] Yeah.
[01:02:52] And then the parsing of that word that you just used could clarify that for everyone here.
[01:03:00] You said you need to actually think about it.
[01:03:06] What does that mean?
[01:03:07] That means while you're daydreaming while you're sitting around doing whatever you're
[01:03:10] doing this anticipation isn't just going to come and smack you in the face.
[01:03:14] You need to set aside a little time.
[01:03:16] You need to look at what that unit's doing.
[01:03:17] You need to figure out you need to actually think about what's going on.
[01:03:22] What a novel idea.
[01:03:25] That reminds me of way the warrior kid where the first one, Mark thinks he should know
[01:03:31] his times tables and Uncle J.X.
[01:03:34] will have you studied and he says, what do you mean study?
[01:03:37] I should just know him.
[01:03:38] No.
[01:03:39] And you're not going to be able to just randomly anticipate people's needs.
[01:03:42] You need to actually think about it.
[01:03:45] And the last one in this chapter.
[01:03:49] Oh, sorry, not the last one yet.
[01:03:51] That their successes be measured by the overall ability of a unit to perform its whole mission
[01:03:57] and not by the performance of one or two factors.
[01:04:01] So look at people holistically.
[01:04:04] Look at units holistically.
[01:04:05] And then this is the last one that good works by their units be recognized and rewarded
[01:04:10] in such a way as to motivate the greatest number to do well and seek further improvement.
[01:04:14] Good.
[01:04:15] Now we're going to roll into chapter two.
[01:04:21] This is called leadership versus popularity.
[01:04:25] And this is interesting.
[01:04:26] This is where I start to sometimes when I'm reading leadership things in my way.
[01:04:31] Wow, that's really not my viewpoint.
[01:04:33] Hold on a second.
[01:04:34] Like this is a little.
[01:04:35] And then I continue to read and I find, oh, he's saying it a little bit differently
[01:04:40] but he or he sometimes people are actually saying something different but they don't
[01:04:45] even mean it.
[01:04:46] They don't even mean it.
[01:04:48] And you're just to see what I'm talking about.
[01:04:49] So leadership versus popularity, the example of a strong leader.
[01:04:56] During the World War II period, I served as a division commander.
[01:05:01] I served a division commander as his chief of staff and later as one of his combat commanders
[01:05:07] for a period of over two years.
[01:05:09] He was a strong character and a strong leader.
[01:05:12] He had firm ideas about things that he liked and disliked and placed requirements on his
[01:05:17] officers and men in the fields of wearing equipment and uniforms tactical disposition during
[01:05:22] field training, the care and handling of vehicles and other things, many of which were
[01:05:27] unpopular.
[01:05:29] At one time in an evening discussion period, I pointed out that these requirements to him and
[01:05:34] asked him if he felt that the effort he put into them was not excessive for the practical
[01:05:40] results which he achieved.
[01:05:42] His answer gave me insight into the problems of training and preparations and preparing
[01:05:47] troops for emergencies or battle for which I've never forgotten.
[01:05:54] He stated that in case of an emergency or battle, a commander was required to place upon
[01:06:00] his officers and men many requirements that were unpopular and for which time was not available
[01:06:05] for hesitation.
[01:06:07] The thought of being popular or unpopular should never enter the mind of a commander.
[01:06:13] That's the part where I start going, heesh, wait a second, what are we talking about?
[01:06:18] I'm not totally there yet, but I'm a little nervous because what this translates to and
[01:06:22] Lafes talked about this before.
[01:06:25] Lafes had someone come and speak to the junior officers and senior officers and the message
[01:06:32] was, in no uncertain terms, when you're in charge, you should not be liked.
[01:06:39] You should not be liked.
[01:06:40] When you're in charge, you're going to make all these hardices.
[01:06:42] People aren't going to like you.
[01:06:43] You need to be okay with that.
[01:06:44] Lafes had to kind of like when this senior officer would leave, Lafes had to like back
[01:06:48] these guys down and say, listen, let me put that in perspective.
[01:06:57] So this is he pointed out that a commander who was unable to obtain compliance with unpopular
[01:07:03] requirements from his officers or men during training and during preparation for combat
[01:07:07] would not be able to obtain prompt compliance with his requirements to meet emergencies or
[01:07:13] to attack an enemy in battle.
[01:07:15] He said that the requirements he placed in the training periods served three purposes.
[01:07:20] One, they conditioned his command to carry out promptly his instructions to the way which
[01:07:26] his men carried out these requirements served as a constant measure to him of his old on
[01:07:32] his officers and his men and they with other things helped instill a fierce pride in the
[01:07:39] division.
[01:07:42] I might add that this officer was one of the most respected division commanders that
[01:07:46] I have known even now over 15 years after he left the division, he is the most popular
[01:07:52] man present when the division association has a convention.
[01:07:56] So all this talk about him not being concerned about me, oh, he is the most popular guy.
[01:08:00] I love him, yeah.
[01:08:01] Everybody loves this guy.
[01:08:03] Why do they love this guy?
[01:08:04] Do they love him because he was nice?
[01:08:06] Do they love him because he gave him extra brownies and ice cream?
[01:08:10] No.
[01:08:11] He loved them because he was dis, they loved him because he was disciplined.
[01:08:15] That's what they loved.
[01:08:20] Later on when I was placed in command of a combat command of the division, I remembered
[01:08:25] the procedure off and I was actually when I first read this thing, I thought he was talking
[01:08:30] about patent because he worked for patent but patent wasn't alive 15 years later to be
[01:08:34] the most popular guy.
[01:08:35] So I don't know who it was.
[01:08:36] I have to do more research.
[01:08:41] And this says an unpopular requirement that paid off.
[01:08:44] Later on when I was placed in command of a combat command of the division, I remembered
[01:08:47] the procedure often used at 11 worth of attacking at first light in the morning.
[01:08:53] One of the reasons for doing this was in hopes of catching the enemy unprepared to resist
[01:08:57] attack.
[01:08:58] If we were taught this, if we were taught this, probably the enemy did likewise because
[01:09:02] of this whenever I had combat command in the field for training, I required every man to
[01:09:08] be up, dressed and manning his battle station at first light.
[01:09:12] Communications were checked all the way from squad level to me and reports of readiness
[01:09:16] were laid from the squad level to me.
[01:09:20] After daylight, and if it was decided that no attack was probable, the troops were permitted
[01:09:24] to eat breakfast and then proceed with the day's activities.
[01:09:27] I talked about this on the earliest of podcasts.
[01:09:30] This early morning stand to, that's what it's called, was never popular and there
[01:09:35] would be many requests to relax the requirement of it, particularly for men who had been
[01:09:40] on guard or night duty.
[01:09:41] While these requests were never granted, because these requests were never granted because
[01:09:45] I felt that if we were overrun while still asleep, the enemy would not spare the man who
[01:09:50] had been late getting into bed.
[01:09:56] This procedure was followed in my command throughout the war.
[01:10:01] I can say that even in the face of the enemy, it was not particularly popular.
[01:10:05] So even though even in combat, guys were like, bro, let me sleep in, sir, let me sleep
[01:10:10] in.
[01:10:11] Even in combat.
[01:10:12] Even in combat, where the enemy might really attack and kill you and overrun you
[01:10:15] and people will say, hey, man, can we just get some sleep in the morning?
[01:10:20] But he never, he never submitted to that.
[01:10:24] And he said, however, it did save elements of my command on several occasions from being
[01:10:30] overrun and destroyed in the early morning.
[01:10:33] At one time, a portion of the 37th tank battalion.
[01:10:37] How cool is that?
[01:10:38] The 137.
[01:10:39] The 7th.
[01:10:40] Shout out to the bandits battle over a body.
[01:10:43] A portion of the 37th tank battalion was saved from destruction by an enemy tank brigade
[01:10:48] attack in the fog at first light because it was ready.
[01:10:52] This particular requirement was probably most unpopular.
[01:10:55] My combat command headquarters and there was considerable griping about it on many occasions.
[01:11:00] However, one morning when my command was in the rear of the enemy lines east of Nancy,
[01:11:06] the headquarters personnel were alert at first light, men were manning their defensive
[01:11:09] positions.
[01:11:10] Weapons had been checked at communications at the beginning of the established.
[01:11:12] In particular, the three tank destroyers attached to my headquarters were in position loaded
[01:11:17] and manned.
[01:11:19] At first light, a platoon of enemy tanks came into the headquarters area, which in the case
[01:11:26] of a combat command headquarters was not very large.
[01:11:30] The tank destroyers immediately took them under fire and succeeded in knocking out three
[01:11:34] of the tanks.
[01:11:35] The other two withdrew.
[01:11:37] Our loss during this engagement was only one tank destroyer, which was destroyed by a direct
[01:11:41] hit from one of the enemy tanks.
[01:11:42] There was much discussion of this attack in the headquarters in the days that followed.
[01:11:47] One of the men stated that he never realized how crowded a combat command headquarters
[01:11:51] could be when an enemy attack came.
[01:11:56] I heard no more comments in my headquarters about the requirement for everybody being dressed
[01:12:01] alert in position in daylight.
[01:12:04] The purpose of this account is to point out that a commander and leader owes a responsibility
[01:12:09] to his men to require them to do things which are for their own benefit and for the benefit
[01:12:17] of the command as a whole, even though their requirements are not popular.
[01:12:25] So you want to follow a threat, you want to follow a threat, go read the book about face
[01:12:30] and read what hack worth did when he took over the 439.
[01:12:36] Let's see, it's the exact same story.
[01:12:39] What he made these guys do was change their, you had to dig a hole to the sleep first of
[01:12:42] all.
[01:12:43] They actually started digging in.
[01:12:45] They started moving their positions every night.
[01:12:47] They started expanding the perimeter, retract their perimeter and by the way, when you dig
[01:12:50] a hole in Vietnam or really anywhere, when you dig a fighting hole, a fighting position and
[01:12:55] then you're going to move.
[01:12:56] Guess what you got to do with that one that you just left.
[01:12:59] You got to fill it in.
[01:13:00] So if we put out the perimeter and then we move back that night 25 or 50 meters because we
[01:13:05] don't want to get mortgages, we know the enemy saw where we were were.
[01:13:08] We got to fill in that fighting position because we don't want the enemy to be able to use
[01:13:12] it.
[01:13:13] So that's a lot of digging to be doing.
[01:13:14] To be doing, well guess what, he did this hack worth did this.
[01:13:18] Hey, they got rid of all the crap that they had in their battalion CP, they got rid of
[01:13:24] all that junk.
[01:13:25] They started digging in, they started moving their perimeter and the first time they got
[01:13:28] mortgard under his command.
[01:13:31] There were no casualties because the elements had moved and guess what?
[01:13:34] There was no more complaining.
[01:13:36] This is the exact same story.
[01:13:38] I wonder where Hack worth figured that out from.
[01:13:40] Totally.
[01:13:44] Next chapter.
[01:13:47] Ethics, conduct, and standards of officers.
[01:13:52] Subtitle.
[01:13:53] Set an example.
[01:13:58] What you know, I had such a good benefit.
[01:14:00] I benefited the luck that I had in my career in my life is amazing, but one of the most
[01:14:05] amazing things is when I was a young and listed guy in the SEAL teams, I was watching
[01:14:11] my lieutenant.
[01:14:14] I was tracking.
[01:14:16] I was tracking those boys.
[01:14:18] When they forgot to piece of gear, I was like, oh, when they were late, oh, I was tracking
[01:14:23] them.
[01:14:24] I knew that.
[01:14:25] I knew I knew better than anyone could have ever taught me or told me.
[01:14:30] I was like, well, we're sitting here saying this.
[01:14:31] You've said it five times today.
[01:14:32] I've said it eight times today.
[01:14:33] Your people are watching you.
[01:14:34] Your people are watching you.
[01:14:36] Your people are watching you.
[01:14:37] I could have been told that a hundred times and it wouldn't have been as effective as
[01:14:40] me actually knowing what it was like to watch my my bosses.
[01:14:45] And note the good and note the bad.
[01:14:48] Set an example.
[01:14:50] The ethics, conduct, and standards of behavior of a few of our officers are matters of
[01:14:55] real concern to me.
[01:14:57] Except for a few junior officers, our officers are either regular officers or reserve
[01:15:01] officers serving because they chose to do so.
[01:15:04] It is up to the latter group to set the proper example in all things for those junior
[01:15:09] officers.
[01:15:10] It is up to all officers to conduct themselves in such a manner that the prestige of the
[01:15:15] army officer will be high in the eyes of the public and of our enlisted men.
[01:15:23] And officer who behaves in an unbecoming manner destroys his standing in a unit.
[01:15:32] Man, if we broke out and started talking about what's unbecoming for a leader.
[01:15:37] Because you know, when you hear the word conduct, I'm becoming an officer.
[01:15:40] You think like, oh, this guy is out.
[01:15:42] Lack of like an idiot.
[01:15:43] What about when that guy shows up 12 minutes late?
[01:15:47] What about when that guy does bring the right piece of gear?
[01:15:49] What about when that guy loses temper?
[01:15:51] Whatever it is.
[01:15:53] All those little things.
[01:15:54] Yeah.
[01:15:55] All those little things add up.
[01:15:57] And if you were a leader in an organization, you got to understand that your people are
[01:16:02] watching you.
[01:16:04] And what that actually is is an opportunity to pull them into your sphere of influence.
[01:16:08] Because as a young Marine, I was looking for role models too.
[01:16:12] I was looking when I was keeping track of those little things at little slip here, that
[01:16:17] little slack over here, that little error here.
[01:16:19] And I was looking around when I saw the ones that were holding the line.
[01:16:22] That's where I wanted to be.
[01:16:24] And if you're that leader, you will pull these people into your sphere of influence.
[01:16:29] And you can lead and match them.
[01:16:30] And you can have, you can design the culture of the entire unit by yourself just by
[01:16:37] setting that right example.
[01:16:39] Because you will pull people into your sphere.
[01:16:42] And they will follow that lead and they will do the same thing.
[01:16:44] And then all of a sudden you got folks down the organization that aren't holding the
[01:16:48] line.
[01:16:49] You don't have to be the one to go down there and fix it.
[01:16:50] Because you've got this little army of people on your little team that are doing that
[01:16:55] across the organization.
[01:16:58] So I was in the teams back in the day.
[01:17:01] And I was getting ready.
[01:17:04] I think I was actually I had been picked up for the Seaman to Admiral program.
[01:17:11] So I was I had been picked up.
[01:17:14] And I was super stoked.
[01:17:16] And I was, but I was still at Seal team one.
[01:17:18] I had finished out my time there before I went to Austria candidate school.
[01:17:22] And then I would go from off-stricated school.
[01:17:24] So I either had been picked up.
[01:17:26] I think I'd been picked up.
[01:17:29] But another guy, another officer, another prior and listed officer who did the program that
[01:17:37] I was doing.
[01:17:39] Right?
[01:17:40] And he'd been picked up and he had gone to off-stricated school and then he showed up at
[01:17:45] Seal team one.
[01:17:46] So he was, you know, he was almost, he was very similar to me in the fact that we were both
[01:17:50] prior and listed guys, he got picked up.
[01:17:52] I think it was one year ahead of me.
[01:17:54] And he shows up at Seal team one.
[01:17:56] And I remember seeing this dude for the first time.
[01:18:00] And look, you know, I just looked at him and I was like, damn, this dude is squared away.
[01:18:08] And I couldn't even really, I couldn't even really understand.
[01:18:11] I said, well, why does this guy's whole uniform look?
[01:18:16] Square to away.
[01:18:17] This guy looks like he's on another level.
[01:18:20] And you know, wearing the locker room or whatever, well, guess what?
[01:18:24] He was wearing shirt stays.
[01:18:25] Do you know what those are?
[01:18:26] I do.
[01:18:27] I'm the one who you do.
[01:18:29] So he was wearing shirt stays, which is the way that you roll with at OCS.
[01:18:35] It's like, you're wearing shirt stays.
[01:18:36] That's all there's to it.
[01:18:37] So for those of you who don't know it, what shirts stays are.
[01:18:39] They are a piece of elastic material that you attach from the bottom of your shirt,
[01:18:47] which is tucked in and they run down your legs and then they attach to your socks.
[01:18:53] So no matter what happens, your shirt is freaking stay and put.
[01:18:58] And it looks like it looks like the uniform on a mannequin.
[01:19:02] It looks like that.
[01:19:03] Somebody dressed this thing for a mannequin.
[01:19:06] And so I remember seeing it going damn, and he just looked everything looks squared
[01:19:09] away about him.
[01:19:10] He was an awesome physical shape.
[01:19:12] Just a great guy.
[01:19:13] And he is an incredible guy.
[01:19:16] But I remember looking him going damn, this dude is squared away.
[01:19:20] And I saw those shirts stays.
[01:19:21] I didn't even know what those were.
[01:19:22] As an enlisted seal.
[01:19:23] You had no idea.
[01:19:24] Showed up at OCS.
[01:19:27] And you know what?
[01:19:29] Those shirts stays.
[01:19:30] Because pretty much when you're done with OCS, you'd know, really need to wear them anymore.
[01:19:34] Yeah.
[01:19:35] Guess what?
[01:19:36] He did.
[01:19:37] He did.
[01:19:38] And I did.
[01:19:39] I freaking wore those things religiously because that's the difference.
[01:19:44] That's the difference.
[01:19:45] That's setting the example.
[01:19:46] You better look squared away.
[01:19:48] Yes.
[01:19:49] About 100%.
[01:19:50] Oh, the time.
[01:19:51] Where do you not want to look squared away?
[01:19:53] And look, if you got long-term plans and you want to build a team and you got long-term
[01:19:57] plans of having a good team around you, start early.
[01:20:01] I remember joining my first quadrant and there is the training officer bill.
[01:20:05] It's called the training officer.
[01:20:06] It's like the senior of the junior officers.
[01:20:09] So it's like kind of like that's elevated himself amongst all the junior pilots that's kind
[01:20:13] of an a key leadership role.
[01:20:15] And I remember seeing a training and you see a squared away training officer like I want
[01:20:18] to be like that guy.
[01:20:19] And then that training officer would go away and then a couple of years later he'd come
[01:20:22] back to a squadron and he'd be the ops officer, which is like a senior of the middle guys.
[01:20:27] And he'd be squared away by the time.
[01:20:29] And this guy that that I worked with in my squadron, by the time that guy came back to be
[01:20:33] a squadron commander who had been squared away from day one, dudes are running down to
[01:20:38] headquarters with cases of very like I want to get in this guy's squadron.
[01:20:41] People were fighting to get into his unit.
[01:20:44] Was that because he was nice?
[01:20:46] Yeah.
[01:20:47] Was that because he gave people extra liberty?
[01:20:48] Because he was squared away and he held the line and we all wanted to be like him.
[01:20:53] And he didn't like wake up one day like, oh, I'm a commander now.
[01:20:56] I guess I got to square myself away.
[01:20:58] He'd been like that forever.
[01:20:59] Dude's were fighting to get in his unit.
[01:21:01] You know, I was talking about leadership capital the other day on EF online because somebody
[01:21:04] asked a question about it.
[01:21:06] And one of the things is your reputation can contain a positive bank account of leadership
[01:21:14] capital.
[01:21:15] Yeah.
[01:21:16] It can also contain a negative bank account of leadership capital.
[01:21:20] And if you're not, if you just decide that you're going to get squared away when you're
[01:21:24] putting charge, if that's when you make that decision, you're rolling in there with all kinds
[01:21:26] of negative bank account.
[01:21:28] It's a disaster.
[01:21:30] You're with people.
[01:21:31] You don't even know your reputation expense well beyond the people that you hang out
[01:21:34] with.
[01:21:35] Oh, for sure.
[01:21:36] In these communities, people know you have heard of you.
[01:21:38] People are going to run towards you or avoid you and you don't even know who they are.
[01:21:42] And it's all going to be based on your account with them.
[01:21:45] How much leadership capital you've built.
[01:21:47] And it goes well beyond the sphere that you think you're part of.
[01:21:51] Everybody knows you in those leadership roles and they're watching you.
[01:21:56] Back to the book.
[01:21:57] And then have no further respect for him.
[01:21:59] This is for the guy that that behaves and conduct, unbecoming of an officer.
[01:22:04] The enlistment have no further respect for him and he can no longer lead or command effectively.
[01:22:10] His value to his unit's laundry been distraught when an officer accepts his commission.
[01:22:14] He is presumed to have had enough experience to have acquired the ethical and moral
[01:22:18] precepts expected of an officer in a gentleman.
[01:22:21] The record of long services not an excuse for laxity in this matter.
[01:22:27] Damn, he's coming off the top of the right there.
[01:22:30] I just put myself in mental check for my whole life.
[01:22:36] Too often incidents are brought to my attention involving the intent of use of alcohol.
[01:22:43] Drunk and miss at any time in place is disgraceful.
[01:22:46] When combined with the operation of a motor vehicle, it becomes a potential killer.
[01:22:55] Drunk driving didn't used to be a thing.
[01:22:56] Do you know that?
[01:22:57] Yeah, I'm driving didn't used to be a fail.
[01:23:00] It was a badge of honor back in the day on some units.
[01:23:04] When my dad crashed a car drunk in like 1955 or something and the cop like pulled his car
[01:23:15] out the camera right home.
[01:23:16] I mean, my dad was like, whatever, 19 or something.
[01:23:21] And I got hit by a drunk driver when I was kid on a bicycle.
[01:23:26] And I got hit by a drunk driver.
[01:23:28] I got thrown off my bike.
[01:23:30] I had to get stitches in my head.
[01:23:33] And my dad was like, oh yeah, it was almost like, it was almost like, well, you know,
[01:23:39] you had a little too much drink, no, no factor.
[01:23:42] But kiddo, we all right, can we get some money for a new bike because the bike was
[01:23:45] trashed.
[01:23:46] Nowadays, that would be game over for that guy's whole life, right?
[01:23:51] That'd be going to put, would you go to jail for that?
[01:23:53] If you hit a kid on a bike while you're drunk, I would say like no question.
[01:23:57] We'd be going jail, right?
[01:23:59] So it's pretty interesting that way back then he's saying when combined with the operation
[01:24:04] of motor vehicle, it becomes a potential killer.
[01:24:05] Yeah, he's way out in front of the curve here.
[01:24:08] This is someone who's probably spent way more time thinking about that type of character
[01:24:11] than others because back then that wasn't a thing.
[01:24:14] Yeah, you want to know why he's probably gone to visit all of a bunch of guys in the
[01:24:18] hospital that had drunk driving accidents and repaired, you know, had jeeps, had to write off
[01:24:22] jeeps and trucks and whatever else.
[01:24:25] These results are not only detrimental to the individual, but also to the service, particularly
[01:24:29] in overseas commands, commanders at all levels must continually take aggressive action
[01:24:32] who do successive drinking and prevent drunk and driving.
[01:24:37] Long time ago, again, officers are expected to set the example.
[01:24:47] The officer's code, Armyungi Regulation's provide that an officer's signature is in itself
[01:24:52] a certification.
[01:24:54] His signature is his bond.
[01:24:55] A requirement is that an officer is so to conduct himself that he is deserving of such
[01:25:02] trust.
[01:25:04] The appropriate administrative and disciplinary action must be taken against officers who
[01:25:07] are guilty of misconduct and unwilling to live within proper code.
[01:25:11] The officer and officer cannot expect to retain his standing and prestige as an officer
[01:25:16] where he is inefficient or guilty of becoming conduct.
[01:25:21] Each officer must clothe himself with such a scale of values that he knows instinctively
[01:25:26] the things that an officer does not do.
[01:25:31] The officer's code does not get less binding as he goes up and rank.
[01:25:35] The opposite is true.
[01:25:37] It becomes more binding.
[01:25:40] Dude, this dude is holding the line big time.
[01:25:44] I'm feeling like nervous.
[01:25:48] As I always have to point out, I was a young wild frog man.
[01:25:56] I did not come close to achieving these standards.
[01:26:06] I would have loved to have read this book when I was 18, 19, 20.
[01:26:11] I would have loved to have this people that were telling me, hey bro, this is the path.
[01:26:17] This is it.
[01:26:18] This is what you want to do.
[01:26:20] And you know what?
[01:26:21] It takes to be able to do that.
[01:26:22] Here's the reality.
[01:26:26] For me to say, hey, you know what?
[01:26:28] I made mistakes and I do not want you to make them.
[01:26:31] I want you to be better than me.
[01:26:34] I want you to be better than I am.
[01:26:36] I want you're the end state of your life.
[01:26:40] I want to be superior to mine.
[01:26:45] That's what drives giving this kind of advice.
[01:26:49] Hey, listen, I want the end state of your life to be superior to mine.
[01:26:56] That's what we should be thinking when we interact with other people.
[01:27:00] We shouldn't have that little thing in the back of our minds at saying, you know what?
[01:27:03] I had to do this.
[01:27:05] I had to learn the hard way.
[01:27:07] I wish I would have done that, but I'd known told me to do that.
[01:27:10] Why should I tell him?
[01:27:14] What do you got?
[01:27:15] Just wrote it down.
[01:27:16] Because that's a good one.
[01:27:17] That's leadership.
[01:27:19] Yeah.
[01:27:20] Yeah.
[01:27:21] Crazy.
[01:27:23] I was recently invited to the US Army Command and General Staff College to address the
[01:27:32] faculty and students on the subject of command or ship and general ship.
[01:27:37] Following my talk, I was asked to comment on the problem of integrity versus professional
[01:27:41] loyalty when an officer is confronted with orders with which he has a strong disagreement.
[01:27:47] I answered by citing two examples of my experience.
[01:27:50] Once, while I could that, I asked a tactical officer a similar question.
[01:27:54] His answer was to carry out the order loyally and then when you are in a tenable position
[01:27:59] to recommend changes if warranted.
[01:28:02] I have followed this with good results.
[01:28:03] So there's your first answer.
[01:28:05] Hey, you know, I asked Dave to do something that you don't agree with.
[01:28:08] What should you do?
[01:28:10] Well, you should carry it out and then you should pull me aside.
[01:28:12] When you can soon get a chance to go, hey, General, this doesn't seem like it's a good idea.
[01:28:14] Me here's why.
[01:28:16] Good.
[01:28:17] Got that.
[01:28:18] This is a longer example.
[01:28:21] In another instance, when I was a commanding general of the US Continental Army Command, we
[01:28:28] were charged with the service testing of an expensive and important piece of Army equipment.
[01:28:32] This was important enough to assign my deputy, a lieutenant general to monitor closely.
[01:28:38] The test went on for several weeks.
[01:28:39] One day, my deputy reported to me that the piece of equipment was not proving outside
[01:28:43] as factually.
[01:28:45] He was fully convinced of his position.
[01:28:47] I told him how serious and how sensitive such a finding would be.
[01:28:51] I directed that he called in several officers closely concerned with the test for a conference
[01:28:57] with me.
[01:28:58] This was done in all were unanimous supporting the position of my deputy.
[01:29:02] They had beta and results supporting them.
[01:29:04] So they're supposed to test his piece of gear.
[01:29:06] There's a, it sounds like there's an expected outcome.
[01:29:08] It wasn't turned out that way.
[01:29:10] I directed that they prepare a personal letter for my signature.
[01:29:15] The chief of staff of the army or for my signature for the chief of staff of the army
[01:29:19] setting forth their findings and conclusions with supporting data and information.
[01:29:25] After proving and signing it, I had my aid delivered by hand to the chief of staff.
[01:29:30] Within 48 hours, I had a phone call from the chief of staff.
[01:29:33] He was disturbed.
[01:29:34] He told me how serious this was.
[01:29:37] How important the equipment was and how not only the United States, but an allied power
[01:29:42] was interested in it.
[01:29:44] He wanted us to take a positive approach and proceed with the program.
[01:29:49] My reply, so there you go.
[01:29:51] He wrote, hey, there's the problems, these are the shortfalls.
[01:29:53] That's what we all agree on.
[01:29:54] I'm letting you know.
[01:29:56] And his boss says, hey, this is an interesting terminology.
[01:30:01] I want you to take a positive approach and proceed.
[01:30:08] Take a positive approach and proceed.
[01:30:10] So to me, I translate that as a lean towards making this work.
[01:30:17] My reply was that I felt I owed him the loyalty to bring the facts as I believe them
[01:30:22] to his attention and having done that, I was prepared to carry out fully his further instructions.
[01:30:28] The morals of this true story are the chief of staff was in a position to, now this is important.
[01:30:34] The chief of staff was in a position to know of considerations and factors of the
[01:30:39] higher highest importance, which I could not know.
[01:30:44] Now where I think this is, if Dave comes to me and says, hey, I object to this or I got
[01:30:49] the issue.
[01:30:50] My response, hey, Dave, here's what's going on, man.
[01:30:53] Here's why this is important, here's what's happening.
[01:30:55] I would tell you why.
[01:30:56] Here's some things you see that I don't see.
[01:30:58] Here's some things you know, I need to know.
[01:30:59] Yep.
[01:31:00] Yep.
[01:31:01] I had satisfied both my integrity and professional loyalty as well as my duty to my superior.
[01:31:07] I was now free to proceed without compromise on my part.
[01:31:11] To take a negative or I told you so attitude would not have been becoming to a member
[01:31:17] of the team, all members of which were dedicated to doing their best for the army and their
[01:31:22] country.
[01:31:23] So, I wrote about this in leadership strategy and tactics, almost that nausea.
[01:31:29] But there's so many different ways to talk about it.
[01:31:31] And I even want that I cite all the time is the band of brothers, Dick Winters, totally.
[01:31:40] Yep.
[01:31:41] You do the recon.
[01:31:42] Someone gets killed.
[01:31:43] The war is literally within days of ending.
[01:31:44] You do a recon.
[01:31:45] Someone gets killed.
[01:31:46] You come back.
[01:31:47] You get told to do another recon the next night and you say, got it boss.
[01:31:50] And then you go have the guys drink wine and a seller and you don't do the recon.
[01:31:54] Is that a good call?
[01:31:56] Yep.
[01:31:57] Is it supporting the chain of command?
[01:31:59] Nope.
[01:32:00] Did it protect the guys?
[01:32:01] Yes, did it accomplish the mission?
[01:32:03] Yes.
[01:32:04] Could he have argued it a little bit and I forget from the movie what how they showed it?
[01:32:07] I think he pushed back.
[01:32:08] He definitely pushed back.
[01:32:10] But a certain point pushing back would have just gotten fired and then guess what?
[01:32:14] Then they're going on the patrol.
[01:32:15] Then they're going on the patrol with the Yes man.
[01:32:17] With the Yes man.
[01:32:18] Yep.
[01:32:19] For sure.
[01:32:20] And as you're building, as the story is building up, there's a little part of me too.
[01:32:23] But I think a people listening like, so he's already done that.
[01:32:26] He's going to now hold the line.
[01:32:28] This or I cannot in good conscious put this in a positive light.
[01:32:33] Cool.
[01:32:34] I'll find somebody who can.
[01:32:36] And there's a part in there, the humility that it takes.
[01:32:39] He's a four star general in this case to go, you know what?
[01:32:43] The chief of staff knows something.
[01:32:44] I don't know.
[01:32:45] He sees something I don't see.
[01:32:46] Can I consider that and try to go out and go, hey, I tell you what.
[01:32:49] There's some place over who this piece of equipment actually does work pretty well.
[01:32:52] Maybe not here or here.
[01:32:53] But here's some positive.
[01:32:54] Can I do that?
[01:32:55] Yeah, it takes a ton of humility.
[01:32:56] But if you don't do that, the influence you lose to actually provide the outcome that
[01:33:01] you want, which is exactly what you're saying, think about the humility it takes to go,
[01:33:06] maybe I don't have the whole picture.
[01:33:09] And this, I'm going to dig my heels in a hole in the line because it's the right thing
[01:33:12] to do.
[01:33:13] Maybe I actually don't even know the whole story.
[01:33:14] Cool.
[01:33:15] You're fired.
[01:33:16] Right.
[01:33:17] Yep.
[01:33:18] See you later.
[01:33:18] And I'll get a yes man in there and he's going to give me whatever I want for report.
[01:33:20] And that's that.
[01:33:21] Yeah.
[01:33:22] So good.
[01:33:24] Next section.
[01:33:28] And this is chapter four, prestige of the non-commissioned officer.
[01:33:33] And again, once again, I sort of said, well, maybe we don't need to cover this.
[01:33:37] And then as I read through it, I realized what this is talking about.
[01:33:39] And this is talking about something that I've referred to quite a bit on EF online lately.
[01:33:45] So if you think about it from this perspective, it starts to make a lot of sense way beyond
[01:33:50] the military.
[01:33:51] That is respect, respect.
[01:33:56] So prestige of the non-commissioned officer.
[01:33:58] So if you think about this from perspective of how do you respect people, how important
[01:34:02] that is?
[01:34:03] Because that's what he's talking about.
[01:34:05] Continuing on, advances in weapon systems over the past few years have forced many
[01:34:09] changes in our tactile organization and operational concepts.
[01:34:13] The keynotes of our modern army, our mobility, dispersion and small, small, and operations.
[01:34:18] This concept coupled with the many new tools of war requires greater reliance than ever before
[01:34:24] on our non-commissioned officers.
[01:34:26] What do we talk about?
[01:34:27] We're talking about front line leaders.
[01:34:28] So if you're in civilian world, we're talking about front line leaders.
[01:34:31] And guess what?
[01:34:32] This guy was in World War I and in World War I, there was not a bunch of reliance.
[01:34:36] There was not dispersion, meaning everyone was together.
[01:34:38] You're in a big trench, you're all together when the trumpet blows or the whistle sounds
[01:34:43] or the signal comes.
[01:34:45] We're all going at once.
[01:34:46] We're going to go over the top.
[01:34:47] We're going to charge.
[01:34:48] And with hundreds and hundreds of men at the same time, there's no dispersion.
[01:34:53] We're all close together.
[01:34:54] It's not small unit operations.
[01:34:57] And we're not moving.
[01:34:58] So he saw that.
[01:34:59] And we're, look, he says mobility, dispersion, and small unit operations.
[01:35:01] What was World War I?
[01:35:02] It was not mobile.
[01:35:04] It was not dispersed.
[01:35:05] And it was not small unit operations.
[01:35:07] By the time he gets to Korea and then he gets to World War II or sorry World War II and then
[01:35:11] Korea, it's totally different.
[01:35:12] And now he realizes the importance of the front line leaders.
[01:35:16] So how do we rely on these front line leaders?
[01:35:19] So if you're thinking about your front line leaders, here's what you need to do.
[01:35:23] Fully developed the non-commissioned officer to fulfill his role, a commander must place
[01:35:27] with responsibility on him and permit him to assume his place in command.
[01:35:32] You have to give them ownership.
[01:35:35] In doing this, standards of performance need not be lowered.
[01:35:39] Honest errors must be expected and tolerated but corrected.
[01:35:46] When your personnel must not use SERP responsibilities which provide the experience needed
[01:35:51] in developing our junior leaders.
[01:35:53] Don't be the Esman.
[01:35:55] Don't be the easy button.
[01:35:56] Sorry, don't be the easy button.
[01:35:59] Emphasis should be placed on the non-commissioned officer's role.
[01:36:03] Leader, trainer, supervisor.
[01:36:08] Leader, trainer, supervisor.
[01:36:09] This goes back to the developing the echelon front certification program.
[01:36:14] Think about this leader, trainer, supervisor.
[01:36:18] He's got them all mixed in like we eventually got to.
[01:36:21] I didn't have this book and we were starting to develop the program.
[01:36:23] Now that I have it, I'm super stoked that we came to the same conclusion.
[01:36:27] And that is that a leader, a trainer, a supervisor, a manager and instructor.
[01:36:31] They're all qualities that are needed as you come up the chain of command if you're going
[01:36:35] to be in charge of people.
[01:36:39] There follows a list of suggested actions that may be taken each by each commissioned officer
[01:36:45] at all levels of command to further the efficiency and enhance the stature of the non-commissioned
[01:36:50] officer corps.
[01:36:52] Again, how do we respect our frontline leaders?
[01:36:55] Because the more respect we give them, the more respect they're going to give us, the
[01:36:59] more ownership we give them, the more ownership they're going to take.
[01:37:06] Affordy.
[01:37:08] To prevent the use of non-commissioned officers for menial and degrading tasks.
[01:37:15] Okay.
[01:37:16] Ensure that non-commissioned officers are consistently addressed by their rank.
[01:37:20] So you're giving them that respect.
[01:37:24] At here to the chain of command through non-commissioned officer ranks, right?
[01:37:27] So you don't jump down to the front line and start talking them without talking to that
[01:37:31] front line leader.
[01:37:34] Use requirements for officer supervision or mandatory presence at troop formations.
[01:37:40] Let the non-commissioned officer take charge.
[01:37:42] Give them ownership.
[01:37:46] Sometimes for those of you that don't watch the Sun YouTube, when Dave just fully agrees
[01:37:50] with something, he doesn't not as head-yes.
[01:37:53] He shakes his head no.
[01:37:54] As if to say this is just no disputing this at all.
[01:37:59] Avoid mass withdrawal of non-commissioned officer privileges but take positive action against
[01:38:03] individual concerns so don't do collective punitive actions.
[01:38:08] When appropriate, permit key non-commissioned officers to attend staff conferences and commanders
[01:38:13] briefings.
[01:38:14] Hello.
[01:38:15] Take that front line leader, bring him into your higher level meetings, let them see what's
[01:38:20] going on.
[01:38:23] Ensure that deserving high-quality non-commissioned officers are commended for outstanding
[01:38:28] performance of duty by awarding them, combination ribbons, letters of appreciation or
[01:38:34] commendation or certificates of achievement or, and this is Jocco's edition, give them
[01:38:39] more responsibility, give them more ownership.
[01:38:44] Refrain from over supervising the non-commissioned officer after a task has been assigned.
[01:38:51] No micromanage, issue mission type instructions rather than detailed orders.
[01:38:59] I haven't said that yet on this podcast but when I read these things, I feel like I
[01:39:04] owe this guy money.
[01:39:06] Whenever possible, place senior non-commissioned officers under the supervision of Commissioner
[01:39:09] War Officers, inform non-commissioned officers in advance of significant matters pertaining
[01:39:14] to the units such as maneuvers, field problems, training requirements, disciplinary matters,
[01:39:18] standards to avoid unfounded rumors and allow for necessary advance planning at all
[01:39:23] echelons.
[01:39:26] Does it make sense that you keep your unit informed?
[01:39:28] You keep your front line leaders informed?
[01:39:33] What do you think they do when you don't tell them what's happening?
[01:39:35] Do you think they just sit there and silently wait a wait your word?
[01:39:39] No, they make shit up.
[01:39:40] Make it up, yep.
[01:39:45] Is there more?
[01:39:46] This is ridiculous how good this is.
[01:39:49] Grant, non-commissioned officers.
[01:39:50] Again, if you're listening to this and you're not in the military, just replace this with
[01:39:53] your front line leaders.
[01:39:55] Grant, front line leaders, a greater voice in allowing privileges or awards or warning
[01:40:00] punishment.
[01:40:02] Consult with them on matters involving the reclassification and promotion of their subordinates.
[01:40:10] Let it be known that they greatly influence these matters.
[01:40:13] This whole thing is about giving way of responsibility and giving way of ownership.
[01:40:19] Use senior non-commission officers to assist in conducting inspections and ensure distribution
[01:40:25] of directives to non-commission officers so that they may have current information on military
[01:40:30] matters.
[01:40:32] Keep your front line leaders informed.
[01:40:39] Use senior non-commission officers as instructors, back the actions of non-commission officers
[01:40:47] publicly refer to them as non-commission officers, not as NCOs or non-comps, which are two
[01:40:53] slang terms which I do all the time.
[01:40:55] NCOs, non-comps.
[01:40:57] He's saying, give them that and look, it's a little slang term.
[01:41:01] Give them that respect.
[01:41:03] Yeah, the title is, is the prestige of the non-commission officer.
[01:41:07] I mean, that's what he's talking about.
[01:41:09] I mean, that was just a recipe for leadership right there and like I said, these are your supervisors.
[01:41:16] These are your front line supervisors whose management is of the people right at the point
[01:41:20] of friction, the ones doing the work.
[01:41:23] So these are your first line supervisors and second line supervisors closest to your people
[01:41:27] out there making it happen.
[01:41:29] And if you want them to respect you, you gotta give them respect.
[01:41:34] If you want them to trust you, you have to trust them.
[01:41:37] And if you want them to lead, like you gotta let them lead in every single time, you take
[01:41:44] responsibility away from them.
[01:41:46] He said in the beginning, you gotta expect them to make mistakes and make errors.
[01:41:50] You don't ignore it.
[01:41:51] You correct it.
[01:41:52] But you don't take responsibility away from them.
[01:41:54] If I take, if you do something that's not what I want, you work for me, you're one
[01:41:58] of my supervisors.
[01:41:59] You go out there and do something that's not how I wanted it.
[01:42:01] And if I take that responsibility away from you, that's me telling you, I don't trust
[01:42:05] you.
[01:42:06] So with the return on me again, that is, you don't trust me as much.
[01:42:11] That means I still gotta correct that.
[01:42:12] I gotta show you.
[01:42:13] Hey, Jockel, that's not what we're looking for.
[01:42:14] Let me talk you about why we did this in a while.
[01:42:15] Let me explain these things.
[01:42:16] But I get you right back out there to go do it.
[01:42:18] The reciprocal nature of the relationship, everything you want from them, you have to give
[01:42:23] them that it was literally a list.
[01:42:25] It is a checklist of leadership to get the behavior that you want.
[01:42:30] You and I were on a call with one of our clients the other day and it was, it was one
[01:42:36] of those questions came up and there's these four things.
[01:42:40] It's a call.
[01:42:41] Chris, he was on the call and she was quite fired up.
[01:42:43] She's awesome.
[01:42:44] She absolutely.
[01:42:45] But if you want people to listen to you, listen to them.
[01:42:49] If you want people to respect them, respect them.
[01:42:51] If you want people to respect you, you have to respect them.
[01:42:54] If you want to influence people, you have to allow them to influence you.
[01:43:00] And if you want people to trust you, you have to give them trust.
[01:43:07] Couple more things on this section, responsibilities.
[01:43:10] Insist on a thorough appreciation of the non-commissioned officers full-time responsibility
[01:43:13] to his men and to his commander.
[01:43:18] Theral appreciation.
[01:43:21] What does that mean?
[01:43:22] That means respect.
[01:43:23] A point senior non-commissioned officer counsels at each level of command starting with
[01:43:28] the batined separate.
[01:43:29] So again, this idea of creating these councils, these groups within your organization,
[01:43:33] so you can get good feedback as brilliant.
[01:43:36] Encourage non-commissioned officers, officer participation in civic affairs.
[01:43:40] Great.
[01:43:41] The last section here is education and training.
[01:43:43] This is the last thing we're going to cover.
[01:43:47] Nothing can close with prestige.
[01:43:50] A non-commissioned officer who does not know his job and does not play the part expected
[01:43:55] of him as a non-commissioned officer.
[01:43:58] Because of that, we should.
[01:44:01] One, hold classes to ensure that non-commissioned officers are thoroughly trained for their
[01:44:06] jobs and prepared to handle instructions or duties when they appear before their subordinates.
[01:44:12] What is that right there?
[01:44:14] Look, I am responsible for making sure that people below me in the chain of command are
[01:44:18] right or do their job totally.
[01:44:21] Number two, encourage attendance at non-commissioned officers academy and other courses
[01:44:25] designed to enhance the prestige and set the standards expected of non-commissioned officers
[01:44:33] and three encourage non-commissioned officers to take advantage of the many opportunities to increase
[01:44:38] their general level of education.
[01:44:44] And what's just amazing about this?
[01:44:48] That's just another 13 pages of this document, which is 117 pages long.
[01:44:53] We made it through another, I think we might have made it through 14 pages.
[01:44:57] But the section that closes out is to treat people with respect and give them responsibility
[01:45:02] and train them and educate them.
[01:45:07] To take care of your people.
[01:45:09] Now let's point this out.
[01:45:11] I don't care how good of a leader you are.
[01:45:15] If you don't invest in these subordinates, it doesn't matter what you do.
[01:45:19] Those front line leaders are the ones that win.
[01:45:27] They're also the ones that lose.
[01:45:30] So invest in them.
[01:45:32] Treat them with respect.
[01:45:33] Listen to them.
[01:45:35] Allow them to influence you.
[01:45:38] Give them trust.
[01:45:42] And I don't care what your job is or what your vocation is in life.
[01:45:47] You have to work with people.
[01:45:50] Take care of those people and those people are going to take care of you.
[01:45:55] And speaking of taking care of people, Dave, I know that you know that when the aircraft
[01:46:04] cabin loses pressure, the oxygen masks drop down.
[01:46:09] And you have to take care of others.
[01:46:12] Of course.
[01:46:13] But before you take care of others, you have to take care of yourself to make sure that you
[01:46:16] have enough oxygen to live so that you can then put the oxygen masks on your children.
[01:46:23] So even though we need to take care of others and we need to take care of ourselves.
[01:46:27] First we got some ways of doing that.
[01:46:30] One of the ways is Jaco fuel, which is supplements.
[01:46:34] We got a bunch of them.
[01:46:35] We got joint warfare, acrylic oil.
[01:46:37] We got discipline, discipline, go.
[01:46:39] We got discipline with the cans.
[01:46:40] Are you on number two right now?
[01:46:41] Number two.
[01:46:42] What flavors have you torn to today?
[01:46:44] Tax average, Jaco Palmer.
[01:46:47] What's the preference?
[01:46:48] That doesn't actually count the one I had earlier today.
[01:46:52] For my get.
[01:46:53] So I guess I'm one number three.
[01:46:55] We got vitamin D, D3, Cold War.
[01:47:00] Look, there's all kinds of diseases out there.
[01:47:03] I'm not making any claims.
[01:47:05] But some of us haven't caught those diseases.
[01:47:09] So yeah, check that out.
[01:47:10] Walk or your kid, walk, adult, which is just dessert.
[01:47:15] We got, oh wait, we got a new flavor coming.
[01:47:22] It's so good.
[01:47:25] It says like allegedly we're doing it seasonal, but this thing ain't going to be seasonal.
[01:47:29] This thing is going to be all the time.
[01:47:31] It's smashing pumpkin.
[01:47:32] And I don't even know, look, I don't even know what pumpkin things are.
[01:47:40] Are supposed to taste like or whatever.
[01:47:44] But damn, this thing is good.
[01:47:46] It's so good.
[01:47:47] It's like a pumpkin.
[01:47:48] The original B little sent me.
[01:47:50] It was the generic name, the flavor name.
[01:47:54] It was pumpkin spice.
[01:47:57] And so I don't even know, I mean, you don't really eat pumpkin.
[01:48:01] Walk, right?
[01:48:02] I mean, there's a pumpkin pie.
[01:48:03] I get it.
[01:48:04] But you're not sitting around, you know, going to the store grab and a piece of pumpkin
[01:48:08] and eating it.
[01:48:09] That's not happening.
[01:48:10] Not not my house.
[01:48:11] OK.
[01:48:12] Negative.
[01:48:13] So you're not even really a hundred percent sure what pumpkin flavor is.
[01:48:18] Are you?
[01:48:19] Is anyone the only thing I think of as pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving maybe, but to be honest
[01:48:24] with you?
[01:48:26] So I don't even know what we're doing, but all I know is we created something that's
[01:48:30] a freaking tasty.
[01:48:31] It's got like a, I guess if you ever had egg nog before, yeah.
[01:48:37] It's sort of an egg nog cinnamon scenario.
[01:48:41] Sweet, just monk fruit, but it's so good.
[01:48:43] Anyways, we got that.
[01:48:44] We got that going on.
[01:48:45] All this stuff.
[01:48:46] We got chocolate, vitamin shop.
[01:48:50] You can get all this stuff at the vitamin shop.
[01:48:52] Also, if you're in Florida right now, you can get this stuff at Wawa.
[01:48:58] Coming soon, hopefully, to all Wawa's.
[01:49:01] If you're in Florida, and you want to just kind of just fall on support the cause,
[01:49:06] great.
[01:49:07] There's a good way to support the cause.
[01:49:09] Go in there and just clean them out.
[01:49:13] Go get your Wawa on.
[01:49:16] Also, you can get this stuff at originmain.com.
[01:49:17] What do I miss?
[01:49:18] I miss anything?
[01:49:19] Nope.
[01:49:20] I'm on board with all that.
[01:49:21] I'll be, I'm actually excited about that new milk.
[01:49:24] Nobody has knocked strawberry off the top of the platform.
[01:49:29] That is still remain.
[01:49:30] So is your number two?
[01:49:31] I go to.
[01:49:32] Hey, speaking of speaking of discipline go in the can of what you've had, too.
[01:49:37] Three.
[01:49:38] Three.
[01:49:39] What flavor do you have earlier today?
[01:49:41] I had, oh, I had a second, jockel Palmer.
[01:49:45] Okay.
[01:49:46] Is that your kind of go through?
[01:49:47] No, I'll be honest with you.
[01:49:49] I drink all of them.
[01:49:51] I don't even look for flavors and more recent in the game.
[01:49:53] Dude, I'm just in the game.
[01:49:55] There is not one that I can't just be totally stoked to be drinking.
[01:50:00] No, will there be one in the future that you'll be more stoked to be drinking?
[01:50:03] No, yeah, I think there might be.
[01:50:06] So tell us.
[01:50:07] So let's talk to us afterburner or just coming out afterburner or yeah.
[01:50:11] Dave Burke is getting his own signature flavor.
[01:50:18] It's so crazy to think that I'm getting my own signature flavor of a product that I
[01:50:23] actually already love anyway.
[01:50:26] But I'll be honest with you.
[01:50:28] When Pete and Brian at the team like, hey, bro, we would love to have you be part of this.
[01:50:35] I immediately went to my all time favorite soft drink, which I don't drink anymore,
[01:50:40] which is orange, crush or orange soda, whatever that was back when we were kids.
[01:50:45] I don't drink it, but I'll tell you, it's the best thing I've ever, I mean, as I can.
[01:50:49] You're saying you don't drink anymore because you're just not going to sit around drinking.
[01:50:52] Dude, I don't drink soda.
[01:50:53] Yeah, I don't sit around drinking orange juice.
[01:50:54] You're a human.
[01:50:57] But you don't want to have conduct unbecoming when all's just saying, I'm sucking down sugar.
[01:51:02] Negative.
[01:51:03] But I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I don't miss that flavor big time.
[01:51:07] So they were like, hey, what do you think?
[01:51:08] And it was immediate like, bro, or I love orange.
[01:51:11] And then that connection after a mirror was so easy, because who thought of after a mirror
[01:51:15] orange?
[01:51:17] I think it was me.
[01:51:18] I really do.
[01:51:19] Cool.
[01:51:20] Yeah, cool.
[01:51:21] And of course, they designed it.
[01:51:22] Wait, did you have it going into the conversation did you have it?
[01:51:24] Well, kind of like they had mentioned, hey, I think the thing was like, hey, think about
[01:51:29] it.
[01:51:30] It'd be cool to do something.
[01:51:31] The relationship with Scott Floddard.
[01:51:34] No.
[01:51:35] Just that was it.
[01:51:36] It was.
[01:51:37] Hey, you should do one.
[01:51:38] I thought about it.
[01:51:39] I said, hey, what do you think of this?
[01:51:40] And people's like, done, we're executing.
[01:51:42] And then Brian executed and it happened and it was totally good to go.
[01:51:46] Would you know when the release date is?
[01:51:47] I think it's like in the next month.
[01:51:49] I think it's next month.
[01:51:50] I think it's even.
[01:51:51] Wait, what month?
[01:51:52] No member.
[01:51:53] So it's coming out November.
[01:51:54] I think so.
[01:51:55] After burner orange, yes.
[01:51:56] The Dave Burke signature signature drink.
[01:51:59] Yeah.
[01:52:00] I'm playing on it.
[01:52:01] What kind of plane did they put on it?
[01:52:03] NF 35, silhouette.
[01:52:04] Oh, dang.
[01:52:05] Did you influence that?
[01:52:06] Maybe.
[01:52:07] She might have made sure it was the Marine Corps variant.
[01:52:12] Oh, damn.
[01:52:13] Layers.
[01:52:14] In the business, we call those layers.
[01:52:15] Absolutely.
[01:52:16] Dang.
[01:52:17] Even though when you were a charge, when you were a squadron commander, was that
[01:52:23] a Marine Corps squadron?
[01:52:24] Yes.
[01:52:25] I was a Marine Corps squadron with the Marine Corps variant of the plane.
[01:52:28] What did you do with the Air Force?
[01:52:29] You take over to Air Force squadron at some point.
[01:52:31] Air Force Division.
[01:52:33] That was the F-22 Raptor.
[01:52:34] That was a straight up Air Force Unit Air Force aircraft.
[01:52:36] I was a Marine in an Air Force squadron.
[01:52:39] Inside that squadron had a division of all these different airplanes.
[01:52:42] One was the Raptor Division and that's where I operated.
[01:52:45] Dang.
[01:52:46] Yeah.
[01:52:47] Check.
[01:52:48] All right.
[01:52:49] So we got all these cool drinks and they're good for you.
[01:52:52] Which I know it doesn't make sense because people don't understand how it can happen.
[01:52:55] I'll tell you how it can happen.
[01:52:57] You don't cut corners.
[01:52:58] You maintain the screw me on your product to make sure that it's not junk.
[01:53:07] So like I said, vitamin shop, originmain.com.
[01:53:09] You can get them and wall-wall.
[01:53:12] Soon to be worldwide.
[01:53:17] Also if you want to get your gear, you're going to need your gear because you want
[01:53:21] to train your gear because it's going to free your mind.
[01:53:23] It is going to free your mind.
[01:53:25] Go to originmain.com.
[01:53:26] You can get these rash guards.
[01:53:28] You can also get shorts, t-shirts, joggers and guess what just went back in the production.
[01:53:36] Do you know Dave?
[01:53:37] I don't.
[01:53:38] Oh, little something called Delta jeans and I'll tell you what.
[01:53:43] They're freaking savage.
[01:53:45] I said one time and Pete got a big, what is it?
[01:53:49] A chuckle out of this.
[01:53:52] Which you can picture.
[01:53:53] Pete chuckling, right?
[01:53:54] He's kind of a chuckler.
[01:53:56] He was chuckling when I said that Delta jeans are the greatest thing that I've ever put
[01:54:01] on my legs.
[01:54:05] And yeah, so check out that.
[01:54:07] We got boots there.
[01:54:09] All that stuff's available.
[01:54:10] It's all made in America and that is what we're doing.
[01:54:13] We're bringing manufacturing back to America.
[01:54:16] That is what we're doing.
[01:54:17] Go to originmain.com for that.
[01:54:18] We also have another store which echo named Jockel's store.
[01:54:22] Did I go name it that?
[01:54:24] Yes, he did.
[01:54:25] He legitimately did.
[01:54:27] I guess Sarah was going to take the hit on the lack of creativity.
[01:54:30] But I'm going to say echo is definitely involved in making Jockel's store.
[01:54:34] Jockel's store.com.
[01:54:35] We got Raskart's T-shirts, hats, beanies, all that kind of stuff.
[01:54:38] We got Warrior Kids soap there.
[01:54:40] So you can stay clean.
[01:54:41] So check out Jockel's store.com.
[01:54:44] All this stuff will help support the podcast as well.
[01:54:47] Don't forget to subscribe to the podcast.
[01:54:50] Leave a review.
[01:54:53] I also have some other podcasts.
[01:54:56] One's called unraveling, Jockel unraveling with Darrell Cooper.
[01:55:01] Another one's called the debrief podcast.
[01:55:02] We're just still on this thread for now.
[01:55:04] But we talk about just pure leadership.
[01:55:07] It's a little shorter.
[01:55:08] We try and make it a little bit more concise because we know leaders are out there working.
[01:55:11] You don't always have time for a three hour podcast.
[01:55:15] Grounded podcast.
[01:55:16] Warrior Kids podcast.
[01:55:18] We have a YouTube channel where you can check out to see echoes.
[01:55:23] Videos that he makes where he puts just a ridiculous amount of fire and explosions.
[01:55:30] He's not here to defend himself.
[01:55:31] This is boring.
[01:55:34] YouTube channel.
[01:55:37] Psychological warfare, album tracks, MP3.
[01:55:41] Flipsidecam is.com to go to my making cool stuff to hang on your wall.
[01:55:44] Got a bunch of books about face, the thread that leads to this book that we're talking

[01:56:16] Hey, guess what?
[01:56:17] I used to make fun of my publisher and say they're scared about ordering too many books.
[01:56:24] They don't know how many books to order.
[01:56:25] I'm telling them if you pre-order this, it lets me know how many books to order because
[01:56:32] this is hard to sit on a bunch of books.
[01:56:36] I want to produce the amount that I need.
[01:56:38] I don't want anyone to get Christmas to come and you got no way to work it for.

[01:56:58] Oh, what should we do?
[01:56:59] Make the picture of my head bigger.
[01:57:00] Is that supposed to make it better on what they're thinking?

[01:58:37] The same thing.
[01:58:38] What if they have a question for me?
[01:58:39] What if they say, well, you know, I Twitter, I sent nine tweets to Jocco, but he
[01:58:42] an answer because he has to 80 million tweets.
[01:58:45] What should I do?
[01:58:47] Same thing.
[01:58:48] Go to efonline.

[01:58:51] We have a live event.
[01:58:53] Muster 2020.
[01:58:54] As the only one we're doing in 2020, we have, this is not the first live event we're doing.
[01:59:00] We've done other live events.
[01:59:01] I know you've done some live events.
[01:59:02] I know I've done live events.
[01:59:04] Look, they're social distance.
[01:59:06] You can maintain the social distance.
[01:59:08] We'll have the appropriate measures in place so that you can come to the muster.
[01:59:16] It will be fully engaged.
[01:59:17] Look, one thing that's kind of cool.
[01:59:19] At the muster, at the previous musters before COVID, there's a thousand people there.
[01:59:24] There's 800 people there.
[01:59:25] There's 900 people there.
[01:59:27] So that means 900 people trying to talk to us during the breaks.
[01:59:31] Whatever.
[01:59:32] There's no green room.
[01:59:33] If you've never heard of the green room, we're there.
[01:59:34] We're talking.
[01:59:35] If you want to hang out with us, if you want to get some information directly from us,
[01:59:39] come to the muster, there's probably going to be a fraction.
[01:59:43] I would say there's going to be less than half.
[01:59:45] Probably going to be less than 500 people at the muster.
[01:59:48] Believe me, you spread that out over a couple of days.
[01:59:51] You're going to talk to us, ask the questions.
[01:59:53] We'll do whatever we need to do to make sure that you come away from that with the knowledge
[01:59:56] that you need.
[01:59:58] Go to extremeownership.com for details there.
[02:00:02] Of course, we have EF Overwatch if you need leadership in your team, which you do, we have
[02:00:09] we are selecting leaders from the military that understand the principles we talk about all
[02:00:15] the time and we're placing them into civilian companies into your business.
[02:00:19] Go to GFOverWatch.com if you need leaders in your company.
[02:00:24] If you want to help service members, active and retired, if you want to help their families,
[02:00:28] if you want to help gold star families around the world, then check out Mark Lee's mom.
[02:00:35] Mom and Lee, she's got a charity organization.
[02:00:38] If you want to donate or you want to get involved, then go to americasmideawereers.org.
[02:00:48] And if you look, if you just are constantly seeking that hard path and you want to do things
[02:00:54] that are tough, do things that cause you a little bit of suffering, then maybe you want
[02:01:00] more of my gutteral groans as I talk.
[02:01:06] Or maybe you want more of Dave's frothing phonetics.
[02:01:11] Well, either way, you can find us on the in a web, on Twitter, on Instagram, and on Facebook,
[02:01:18] Dave is at David R. Burke, and I am at Jocca Willink, and thanks once again to general Bruce
[02:01:26] Clark for your service to America and for leaving these lessons of leadership behind
[02:01:32] for us.
[02:01:35] And thanks to all those people in uniform out there right now that are utilizing these lessons
[02:01:42] to protect freedom in the world and to police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,
[02:01:48] EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all of the first responders.
[02:01:55] Thank you for protecting us from chaos and mayhem here at home and to everyone else,
[02:02:01] remember these lessons from general Clark.
[02:02:07] Remember the importance of time.
[02:02:08] That's where we started this whole thing today.
[02:02:10] Don't forget about that one.
[02:02:12] Remember the importance of time.
[02:02:14] The clock is ticking.
[02:02:15] Trying to anticipate problems.
[02:02:17] Be reliable, be knowledgeable, show initiative.
[02:02:23] And when you cast judgment, which I do I read these books, I think, oh, that person.
[02:02:27] I wish that person would do that.
[02:02:29] I wish that person would do the other thing.
[02:02:33] And I remember that when you cast judgment, start off by judging yourself because it all
[02:02:42] starts with you.
[02:02:47] Until next time, this is Dave and Jocco.
