and you know there's this whole thing about Hitler's mustache You know Hitler's got the funny mustache and There's some debate on on how much of this is Actually true, but whether it's true or not as a little bit it doesn't really matter Because what it represents so the deal was that Hitler's mustache if you wanted to have a mustache during World War one Because of wearing a gas mask you had to cut your mustache like that Mm-hmm Hitler still wore his mustache like that it was like a constant symbol that He remembered he remembered because he was in World War one and he was wounded in World War one and Through even despite all that insane sacrifice they didn't win and They didn't like the way they got treated by the treated Versailles and so they had that angst They had the economic angst they had all those angst built up and hit look came along and was Ready to let them focus on something else and and now what what Weedor is realizing here is like yeah, he had us focus on something else Yeah, especially because they they all kind of know that there's no strategic Advantage to what they're doing Back to the book Colonel General Paulus and his chief of staff who's fanatic will to hold out was well known among the staffs Relentlessly held on to their fatal decision On their part many generals and their staffs remain the executioners of the orders of destruction under the sorry circumstances for fighting Suffering and dying continued Torcheringly and terribly after the splitting of the pocket the death agony of the army continued for a further week In the general dissolution and catastrophe it was every man for himself More and more order and discipline broke down here and there and the sellers the still able body didn't combat Were the hit among the second wounded cases of uncomrarotterly conduct theft of provisions refusal to obey orders and open mute knee-mounted The little late The elementary drive of self preservation no longer allowed the question of right or wrong to be raised and the same way that the differences Between the front line and rear line S. and the rear echelon were being erased so were the differences in rank and position In the final days summary law was imposed in stollongrad with drastic punishments for any crime Looters were to be shot within 24 hours hundreds of German soldiers who had become weak in their misery thus became victims of German bullets One could no longer generally speak of courageous and heroic fighting Certainly here and there there were individual deeds of courage personal initiative and noble self self sacrifice But by and large Only a mute submission to the inescapable fate remained to the bitter end It was rather the silent heroism of acceptance of suffering and submitting Not the picture that gets painted very often now at this point at this point right now in this battle is when they hear that speech That goering said talking about this great sacrifice and how they fought so well and how they'll be remembered forever and compared them to lianides and the 300 Spartans at thermopoli. Yeah, it's I wonder how much of it is that you know like the soldiers and that even the people in the Nazi party I wonder how much of it is like denial, you know, you know where it's you know how like you're signed on to like some leader during the during the time being They're simple enviable winter clothing and good weapons Sun sub machine guns everywhere and the uniform picture of sheep skins Patted jackets felt boots and fur caps with broad earmuffs swinging up and down The warmly bundled up well merged and splendidly equipped men of the red army with their chunky mostly red sheet faces Formed a stark contrast to our death-free pale filthy Bearded and freezing figures of misery who hung exhausted and sick and they're makes shift winter clothing Consisting of all kinds of fur's blanket scarfs field gray head gear wounds and inadequate foot gear This sudden meeting and comparison at once showed me how low we had sunk and how little we had been prepared for this murderous battle Then the Soviets kind of the Russians kind of have their Shots at him fritzy fascist Hitler kaput They alternated threats and obviously dreadful curses and contemptuous spit Like raging wolfs, vengeful soldiers from the rear echelons fell on the helpless victims time and time again to steal personal baggage and event their spleen So now they're captured and the the Russians start to kind of sing and dance and and sing and old folk songs Back to the book all the noise and exuberance surrounding me formed a shrieking contrast to the inner and outer state which I found myself Torn for my circle of comrades left to myself and my emotions in the midst of the joyful dancing and singing Victors with whom no contact could be established in my inner heart I felt abandoned and without hope totally depressed Upluted cut off from home sunk far away subjugated to a foreign will pitously Pityously thrown to the mercy of an unknown powers To be dependent on the whim of the victor constantly watched menacingly surrounded by barbed wire and guns forced to relinquish any kind of external freedom captivity men an unknown form of human submission and humiliation It is a bounty for us human beings that a merciful hand covers the future from our eyes with an impenetrable veil That's a really great line Had I known then that I was destined for more than seven Comfortless years devoid of love and filled with previously unknown mental and physical tortures and fearful uncertainties On the borderline of life I never would have found the strength to stand the sufferings of the initial hard months of captivity There's till people being disciplined In the midst of the general suffering and dying we helplessly watch the catastrophe and of destruction approaching us mercilessly and inexorably The terrible human tragedy that was nearing its climax was finally commented commented upon by the war News broadcasted home in the pretty and spirited words Equate in stonel and grad Sixth Army is attaching immortal honor to its banners by its heroic and self-sacrificing battle against crushing odds Many of my comrades had mentally written themselves off intentions to commit suicide were voiced with increasing frequency Others had given their valuables and wedding rings to be to the wounded being flown out I Myself had been had so far been at pain to prepare my relatives for the catastrophe by means of sparse hints Now I felt the need to send home open word of farewell and gratitude The letter was hard to write in my ears once more rang rang the last goodbye my wife and Employingly and besiegingly called down the telephone line to Kiev on a spring evening of last year before the seemingly Endless space of Russian planes had swallowed me up Now all would soon be over When I sealed the letter I was gripped by a specially deep despair I felt as though I were suddenly looking into an abyss of suffering and hopelessness towards which our whole nation was Reeling as if the events in stalin grad were a preview of an Immeasurable disaster that was to break upon Germany The general of this division division had a nervous breakdown and was no longer fit for command His hopes of being flown out with the badly wounded and second not been fulfilled He now had to share the fate of his soldiers to the bitter end This general who a short time before was a commander of a division had carried the responsibility from many thousands of men Was once more a mere human being trembling for his life Then did his questions not reveal the same fear that secretly tormented all of us We made one another realize that the impending military Cretastrophe was also a political catastrophe the result of presumptuous beliefs and actions that had long Shaken the healthy foundations of our intellectual cultural and national life Had the power that we served as citizens and soldiers bent its knee before the law that was rooted in the code of ethics Or rather had not a new gospel of violence been proclaimed and introduced that in a fatal reversal of all values had ceased to differentiate Between right and wrong There was only one last support The comforting strength of the Christian belief Perhaps we could pass some of this comfort and support on to other comrades who bewildered were Reeling toward the abyss In their desperation faced with the destruction of a whole world of concepts and in a view of the senseless Senselessness of the catastrophe many a soldier on the staffs as well as within the fighting troops had reached for his pistol to put an end to his life There was no way back and no escape other disguise their secret fear and inner feelings of emptiness Behind a contrived soldierly stance or even deliberately assumed to the cast of Mind of a lanks neck Which is like these guys were these old school German mercenaries that were Super hardcore if they themselves were doomed to go under they would at least sell their skin So dearly to the end and take as many Russians with them as they could now that's interesting he's he's projecting on these soldiers That you know that they're disguising their secret fear You know what I'm telling you right now that some of those Nazi German soldiers they were They were getting after it right they weren't they weren't hiding their their secret fear by acting tough they were ready to die for the fear So let's not just paint with a broad brush there in my opinion If we agreed that suicide was out of the question for religious and ethical reasons As normal we human beings caught up in error and guilt there was nothing left to To us put to drink the cup of suffering to the last bitter drags But they no longer needed to make such a highly costly attempt time was on their side By bearing down on our tenacious defense with a crushing attack our enemy had won its penetration into the pocket Now he was no longer in a hurry and no longer appeared to consider his victim to be very dangerous The battle that had begun in the meantime was merely a question of finishing off a wounded game already marked For death For some time already the Russians had dictated the course of events The date of our final end depended on their will alone The stations of the cross of an army of 200,000 soldiers particularly because of the slow helpless death of such a vast number of human beings Made anything seen before with the exception of verb done pale by comparison A part of the entire German nation was sentenced to death here and by this its vital substance was dangerously under attack The moral effect of these events touched the whole nation In the midst of the general destruction of the army there were thousands of individual tragedies whose localities of horror were the numerous collection points for the sick and wounded whole convoys of mostly open trucks overloaded with their pitiful freight of freezing wounded groaning sick and dying move deeper into the pocket From the second half of January until the bitter end The harsh suffering of the fighting soldiers continued by day and night After eight evil weeks of indescribable torture and deprivations They were now plunged into a veritable hell of hopelessness and destruction Time and again it was fight resist hold to the end then disengage with draw turn back and dig in again for defense in the snow and stonally Harg frozen earth time and again there were heavy losses panic and flight and then never ending use the struggle Struggle against hunger and cold Among the staffs there was an unending tension Proplexity and despair and feverish The staff's first heard the news that the army group Don under field marshal van mainstein von Mainstein had begun the long hope Relief for the long hope for relief operation Soon the good news that also reached the troops the words gave new impetus everywhere Particularly on the hard pressed western perimeter of the pocket spread like lightning mains that manstein is coming The already dying hopes burst further new new courage Happy expectations a new spirit of initiative began to blossom the sufferings and sacrifices to date had not been in vain after all Salvation was now back ining what the fear had promised he was bound to deliver So they get word bandstimes coming This is this this is good if everything went well they thought the hour of all relief could just coincide with Christmas The motorized groups and strong tank units being led by Colonel General Hoff Elements of which had been brought in from France and great haste had begun their relief offensive Hoff spearhead tanks were only 50 kilometers away Hold on we're coming Said one of the encouraging radio messages which spread like wire fire amongst the western edge of the pocket so they're in radio communication 50 kilometers you're coming in from training day Movies and yeah, actually and then come to think about it these concepts right here today when you're saying you know You know when it's going to take for example when it's going good it's easy to turn the blind Isn't that kind of a lot of movies how it is it's like the guy does real good They might still be able to find some warmth Food rest sleep and salvation and so they streamed by the remains of the shattered and decimated formation Trains and re-election on services with vehicles that were slowly being dragged and pushed by wounded sick and frost bitten men There were a macheted figures among them muffled in coats, rags, pitiful rags, painfully dragging themselves forward Leaning on sticks and hobbling all along the frozen feet wrapped in whispers of straw and strips of blankets Drifting along through the snowstorm this was the wreck of the six-th Army that had advanced to the vulga during the summer so confident of victory Men from all over Germany doomed to destruction in a far-off land mutely enduring their suffering Tottered in pitiful drove Drills through the murderous eastern winter These were the same soldiers who had formally marched through the large parts of Europe's as proud conquerors Now the enemy was at their backs and death lurked everywhere There's an interesting piece that I don't go into too much but this guy had written a paper and presented it up the chain of command with talking about what happened in Napoleon and he got kind of told like hey that's not going to happen us back to the book the events of 1812 seemed to be repeating themselves after all once again the Uncanny Russian space was swallowing many tens of thousands of human beings despite Napoleon's Experience the basic elements of geography and meteorology had again been ignored to a frightening degree On top of that the modern superstition that with the help of machines and motors the impossible could be accomplished and the dangers of space overcome had also contributed to our downfall And in a fatal pact with the overestimation of mechanized means of war had stood the misapprehension of the limits of human strength and possibilities We go back to the book an important meeting of the general staff took place at our core Which the commander in chief of the army general Paul is attended with his chief of staff the serious reserved Expression of the tall figure with the head of a scientist reflected something of a burden of responsibility that press down Tormentingly on the shoulders of this man Who is the last time I was to see our army commander in the pocket as far as I can remember he never visited our core again I soon learned of the outcome of the meeting and the grave words of our general staff officers left no doubt about the consequences of the orders that had been issued in the meantime They dealt with the mobilization of the last reserves of the sixth army the encircled forces would a hold on and fight to the last For this purpose the formation of fortress battalions was to be prepared and executed as quickly as possible All remaining reserves of able-bodied men were to be collected and used as infantry members of the Luftwaffe ground personnel and anti-aircraft Troops gunners who no longer had guns, pans or grenadiers, engineers, truck drivers, clerical staffs, re-election law and supply personnel or once again to be ruthlessly combed out The order amounted to the virtual dissolution of the re-election law services and clearly demonstrated that the Emovalized army was doomed to stay put and fight to the last man and the last bullet So it's gonna make you uneasy there's something like a I feel like that guy That guy got a certain level of satisfaction just by saying like don't worry We're coming like he had this moment of glory. So I mean he's like that's the wrong question to ask you know he's like wait what do you mean he's like He's like just just don't ask that question basics. You got to finish sprint through the finish Like or that like races like a hundred meter dash, you know the guys like or the 200 meter Yeah In the meantime something unbelievable to happen and made quickly made the rounds our quartermaster A still young general staff officer had suddenly disappeared his driver who had taken to the Gumrak air base had waited in vain for his return the lieutenant Colonel was missing He had silently left Stalin-Grad left the Stalin-Grad pocket the zone of death and destruction on his own initiative Probably is a mixture of nerves fear cowardice and the vain hope then in the general confusion He might be able to fly out and save his life that attempted him to desert The commanding general had made increase by radio the deserting staff officer had shown up at army group Plaming the flow now on official assignment from the core on matters of supply Our general was wild with indignation and rage to declare that he would have the criminal flown back into the pocket and shot before our eyes We were all deeply depressed and and with and anticipated with horror the terrible scene that had been announced And which we were spared to our relief our quartermaster was shot outside the pocket on the spot where in his fatal weakness He had hoped to find a door to freedom in life so again even though I just talked about some of the Nazis being Committed to the end there was many of them that were just trying to get the hell out of there Back to the book our commanding general spoke openly of the impending collapse Occusingly and with bitterness and secret anger he pointed out that it was not our fault We had gotten into this deviless situation of a catastrophe from which there was no longer means of escape.
