That's a good idea that makes sense You know, I like that those are all things that are gonna disarm somebody a little bit and Once you disarm them they're gonna they're gonna Open up they're gonna open up a little bit missile Launcher and it it has a radio or radar on it and it can track aircraft coming in and if you're a fighter aircraft You don't want to say what you want to stay away from that thing because it'll get you locked on radar It's gonna fire a heat-seeking missile at you and kill you So for them it's a surface it's a strong point for an aircraft it's a strong point But for a ground troop They don't put you know the highest level of troops Guarding these things because they're in the rear a little bit they put like kind of you know some what they call him here They're manned by troops who are not combat oriented so that means it's a softer target Back to the book. But if you're moving fast you can deal with that exposure Critics of these faster moving forms of combat characterized by initiative at the low level fear that they will lead groups To groups of men moving willy nearly about the battlefield and that commanders will lose control So people say oh, you know if I give so much so much initiative at the low level I'm gonna lose control of it and people are gonna be running around like chickens with their heads cut off This need not be so if the concept of surfaces and gaps is employed properly it will not be so That is why we have control measures the boundary the limit of advance the phase line can still be used It must be remembered that these control measures should serve their function But not be rigid lines that cannot be changed or ignored when the situation changes They should be kept to a minimum and must always be flexible Therefore it takes courage and moral character to select a main effort That is why the weak Commander and the amateur so often failed to do this in fact the weak commander will actively avoid choosing a main effort His very convenient for the commander weak and character to avoid selecting the main effort because if the battle goes on Favorably he can blame someone else for the mistake The commander who has taken the stand and selected his own main effort cannot do this Therefore in a sense the main effort is a moral commitment Taking some ownership by selecting the main effort And you got to dig that The next concept in again, you know I'm I'm cruising through this book like I always do only reading I don't know probably A very small percentage of it 15 percent and There's a ton in here you know and the dangerous part about getting giving to like going to front of the direction How you put it is you don't prepare them like they wind up when they're on their own Like they're not prepared for like like the tough parts Yeah, I'm the leader of the follow-up kind of thing Keep the goal in mine you're gonna do basically with your ownership You're gonna do your part and then some if someone's not doing you know certain things or whatever You're gonna take the lead you're gonna do your job in it to achieve the goal therefore pulling everybody ahead Fluidity Remember we even hear it a lot about in the Vietnam war the the Vietcong were too rigid they would just try their plan Didn't have the fluidity the main effort should be directed against enemy weakness not enemy strength Here you see the interconnection between the concepts the connection between the concept of the main effort and the concept of surfaces and gaps All the concepts are worked together at the same time the main effort cannot be understood in isolation from surfaces and gaps because it is directed against enemy weakness And another another One of the four laws combat that we talk about in the book extreme ownership is simplicity Simple back to the book even the principle of simplicity can be recognized in the concept of the main effort Instead of trying to do 10 different things we are focusing on one There will be many other efforts going on at the same time, but all in some way Directed at making the main effort succeed So what do you gain from this main effort? Right, you know like let's say I'm a way better striker than one guy and his duty to his way better than mine I can stay on you know it's obvious that's where I'm gonna talk but in this case, it's not like that. In order to this gives the order the quality that Eric von Mannstein called long term it can endure the test of time your commander can lose Communication with you yet you can still carry out his intent because you know what he wanted and you can Continue to act within his intent for a long time without checking back Understand why as briefed by Lieutenant Colonel echo Charles Fixed rules are not appropriate in instructing how to as how to assign missions to often students reject good ideas about tactics Because they cannot get their thoughts to fit the format of the operation order that is Being demanded the important thing is that the mission be clear Compared to clarity format is of little or no consequence Then this is We talk about it in extreme ownership that these massive power point briefs that I mean hundreds literally you know hundred to 150 slides to try and make the To try and brief a mission when and and the leaders would away so much time trying to put these briefs together Maybe there wasn't rebel, but we were we were like outsiders, you know, we were like going hard and The group of guys I was with when the guys I went through seal training with and went to seal team one with me back in the day You know, we we were getting effort we were pushing hard we were You know being hardcore yeah, like these kids who only get scolded, you know They don't get like compassion and and compliment and support you know they only get scolded a lot of times I mean there's a lot more to it, but a lot of times they're just gonna do the minimum and clearly to not get scolded too far together direction We get spoiled I would just call them free-frow information We're gonna learn from in the first the first section is called surfaces and gaps The concept of surfaces and gaps is one of several concepts that bear on tactics It is unimportant whether you refer to this concept as surfaces and gaps or soft spot tactics or simply the idea of Pitting your strength against the enemies weaknesses That is what it is all about strength against weakness call it what you will the term Surfaces and gaps is derived from a German term flaking on the lukin tactic Which means simply the tactics of surfaces and gaps the surfaces being the enemy strong points Which we avoid the gaps being the weak points that we want to go through Now La Delle Hart if we talked about already today Called it the expanding torrent system tactic he drew an analogy between attacking an attacking army and a torrent of water If we watch a torrent bearing down on each successive bank of earth and damn in its path We see that it first beats against the obstacle feeling and testing it on all points Eventually it falls it finds a small crack Through this crack pour the first driplets of water and rush straight on the pent-up water on each side is drawn towards the breach It swirls through around the flanks of the breach wearing away the earth on each side and so widening the gap Simultaneously the water behind poor straight through that breach between this the side eti's which are wearing away the flanks Directly it is passed through it expands to widen once more The on-reach of the turn of the torrent Thus as the water pours through it in and an ever increasing volume the on-reach of the torrent swells to its original proportion Leaving in turn each crumbling obstacle behind it Long paragraph yeah sure YouTube you can support that way and of course if you like the shirts Get a shirt Got a kind of a new one the the trooper one just it's just the basic brand in chocolate podcast if you're on YouTube right now I'm wearing one right now You know Debbie's one of the one of the troopers Just take a picture of the day like my mom just amazing background Mountains snow cap mountains trees Trooper trooper dish That was good. So right off the bat you'll be kind of one of those guys that's more approachable But here's here's one that's harder I mean it's simple, but it's it's kind of harder to do because I think it comes kind of natural Easy so not easy is don't talk bad about people and When people are talking bad about people like to you or around you or whatever don't like jump in and kind of accommodate them So then they talk about the ways you can do it you can do it through fire power of a drop in bombs by suppression by assault All those different ways to create gaps with you know using direct fire to soften up targets And then then I like these tactics a little bit better another way of creating gaps is through supporting attacks by attacking one point along the line We may divert the enemy from another point and by drawing them off created gap again this is in linear terms for instructional purposes for simplicity But do not get a linear mindset Sometimes a less costly way of creating a gap is through deception by causing the enemy to think that we will attack at one point There by enticing him to draw his forces off from another point But this is like the kind stuff where you can literally turn on that like right when you read a certain sentence And it's giving you whatever you know whatever this advice is whichever one it is but the Extreme Ownership will say You can turn it on right then and there like right then You know I forgot Another tactic like when you talk to people like to calm them down or whatever like let's say something they lose their temporal The camera something like that , you know how you use the word passionate passionate Is it basically like an excuse word for someone being like you know people like it's a fashion in Compassionate you can be it can be you can be you Cuz okay, so you don't want to get confusing be like I'm gonna take the shrimp tech in it's like a like a caffeine boost or something You know, you don't because it's not that's not so it's He wants to go as long as possible The reconnaissance pull tactics of the German blitzkrieg were inherently disorderly now this is something that's very Contrary to what people think of of the German military and even the German culture German culture is very orderly and here we say the the blitzkrieg was inherently disorderly Back to the book higher headquarters could neither direct nor predict the exact path of the advance But the multitude of German reconnaissance thrust generated massive confusion among the French in 1940 Each was reported as a new attack the German seemed to be everywhere and the French who system demanded certainty before making any decisions were paralyzed It's it's very interesting to think about that idea of We all want to have certainty and what's going to happen and how in in battle and in life if you wait until you're 100% certain you're probably going to be too late Speaking of certainty three all patterns recipes and formulas are to be avoided The enemy must not be able to predict your actions if your tactics follow predictable patterns The enemy can easily cut inside your utaloupe if you can predict what you will do you will be waiting for you This is why it's so hard to tell someone how to do maneuver warfare There is no formula you can learn when someone says Cut all the bull about theory just tell me what to do you can't You can talk about how to think and about some useful techniques No two situations are identical that is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous Another principle that follows from is from this is never do the same thing twice Even if something works well for you once by the second time the enemy will have adapted So you have to think of something new No one thinks of becoming a great painter simply by imitating Michelangelo Similarly you can't become a great military leader just by imitating someone It has to come from within in the last analysis military command is an art One man can do it and most will never learn Little bit of maneuver warfare and So so at the the way the book is broken up this book is called maneuver warfare handbook it's it goes into to breaks into another section which we're gonna get to in a minute It's cool if you like podcast why not like the video version If you even like videos I'm gonna add some stuff in there some whatever some I'll take steelies teeth Other stuff little mashups or whatever If they're lame just unsubscribe You're confident that they will not be right. He's finding some gaps to get through Not no exactly where he is Another problem is that artillery in air might not be May not be controlled as closely as is possible in slowing slower moving forms of combat so you start to Deal with the problems of of air support and artillery is a little trickier to use because you have people moving Around the battlefield and you're not sure where everyone is and that makes it very difficult Because you obviously don't want to drop bombs on your own people Another problem associated with the concept of surfaces and gaps is that as we penetrate deeply Often on narrow fronts our flanks become exposed There are however compensating factors again related to speed We are moving quickly the enemy is always off balance remember the old adage there is security in speed So in other words as you penetrate into a into a zone you're gonna be exposed a little bit He's gonna deviate when something changes like he can't he's of course is gonna deviate He's gonna make those adjustments, but you don't want a deviate too much right and then I got done I said so I was I'm just gonna move some you know, but some some heavy get my lift on and when I when I went heavy I was like man that feels good Great all loose some all warm and so now I've just kind of started doing it a little bit We're gonna we better we better attack that hard no wrong answer that's a surface we're looking for gaps so don't make the main effort The the strong point make it the weak point back to the book be prepared to be surprised Be weary of the council do not ever be surprised in war you will be surprised The task is to learn to deal with surprise If what you thought would be an enemy weakness becomes the enemy strength you should not be disrupted If your taxes tactics are fluid you can deal with surprise you will shift your main effort to enemy weakness and go on through That is how the main effort works in the offense so so like Once you You're gonna have you once you get them disarmed by just opening your mind given a little compliment Tell them that you like whether they're coming with coming from and then you start to probe and trying to figure out what's going on And instead of being direct right we want to use the indirect method here If the observations must be passed up the chain of command the orientation made in the decision taken at a high level and the command for action Then transmitted back down the chain the Ud aloup is going to be slow As the Israeli military historian Martin van Crevel has observed from Plato to NATO The history of command and war consists of an endless quest for certainty Certainty concerning the state and intention of the enemy's forces certain de-concerning the manifold factors Which together constitute the environment from the weather and the terrain to the radioactivity and presence of chemical warfare agents and Last but definitely not least Certainty concerning the state and activities of one's own forces Historical commanders have always faced the choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty One was to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man Allowed to do only that which could be controlled That's centralized command the other to design organizations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control This second the second of these methods has that's decentralized command The second of these methods has to buy and large proved more successful than the first and The ongoing revolution in the technology of command notwithstanding this is likely to remain so in the future and indeed so long as war itself exists Very obvious stuff and again, you know in in our book Stream ownership. I need to step up or If he doesn't have any potential at all then maybe he looks at it and says You know what I'm maybe I'm not fit for this or maybe they don't realize it's happening You'll not take it their job from them because other people will eventually realize Now the thing that you have to be careful of Is if you say oh he's not leading I'm gonna lead That your ego starts saying I'm gonna lead her That's pretty normal But initiative and originality He's telling in order to be a good leader You got to free your mind Now like I said the book makes a transition from being the From being the introduction by William Lind about maneuver warfare and then it slides into another section Which is just about as big and this this part is called fundamentals of tactics and this section is Written by Colonel Michael D. Wiley United says Marine Corps and he ran a course Fundamentals of tactics course and this is Sort of the this is the this is the notes from the course when he would teach this course the fundamentals of tactics and a Colonel Wiley Kind of interesting he went to the Went to the using elisted marine then he went to the naval academy and he was Jim webs Company commander in Vietnam Vietnam and and Jim web is a fairly Famous guy he was a navy cross winner. And as I'm sort of thinking about how I'm gonna Manage and how I'm gonna like if I could tell people like listen, I'm sorry I just can't I physically can't do it
