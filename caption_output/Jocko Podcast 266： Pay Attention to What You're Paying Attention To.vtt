00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Pondcast number 266 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And joining us again tonight is Dave Burke. Good deal, Dave Burke. Good evening, Dave. Good evening.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So we've knocked out two chapters of Marine Corps, Dr. Publication 1, TAC 4, which is called Competing.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And today we're going to delve into the third chapter. Now we have had expectations in each one of these of doing more than one chapter.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I don't think we're going to make it, especially because three has a lot of good stuff in it.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And four is longer. So I don't know if you get halfway through four anyways.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we're going to delve into chapter three. And before we kind of kick that off.

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In the last chapter and throughout the book thus far, the Marines have been calling competition or describing competition as an enduring conditioning.

9
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Are you getting a enduring condition? It's enduring. It's always happening. Always.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And then when we got done, I think it was with the first chapter and we did an underground podcast. And I talked about that clip from there will be blood.

11
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. And I kind of talked about this fact that I related to that.

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And that I can be really competitive in a lot of ways. And since competition is an enduring condition, that must mean that I'm always competing with everyone all the time.

13
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And if I'm always in competition, well then when do I get a break, when do I sleep? Well, we're not sleeping. I'm not a lot of obviously.

14
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But how am I not getting burnt out?

15
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm always competing. How am I not getting burnt out?

16
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And I was thinking about that because I start to think about people hearing this. And I like to think through how people are going to interpret what I'm saying.

17
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And Dave, you and I say it's a lot with just the title of the first book, Extreme Ownership. And people think Extreme Ownership.

18
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But it's mean we need to be extreme about stuff. And we have to write a whole other book, kind of write a whole other book with Dave called the dichotomy of leadership saying, no actually you gotta be balanced. We don't want to be extreme.

19
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So when I think about talking and I'm sitting here saying, I'm competing all the time and we're competing and everything is a competition.

20
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And I think if someone's going, okay, well, we're going all the time. And then they're going to get burnt out.

21
00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And how is it that I'm not getting burnt out? Am I superhuman? No. I'm just another person. So how is it that I'm competing all the time, which I can tell you, I can tell you honestly, I am competing all the time.

22
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm also telling you I'm not superhuman. How is this happening? I can explain it. The kind of people that get burnt out and fall apart.

23
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The reason that that happens is because they are competing at a tactical level.

24
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That's what's going on. They don't get caught up in bar braels and street fights and duels and arguments. And they want to win every altercation they see occurring anywhere around them. And their ego won't let them rest.

25
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I'm not doing that. I don't care about the bar brawl or the street fight or the argument. I don't care about those things. Don't care about them.

26
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm in competition, but I'm not in competition at a tactical level. I'm competing strategically. At least I'm trying to, right? I'm not perfect. I'm trying to compete strategically.

27
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Now, do you sometimes have to win tactical battles? Do you sometimes do you have a battle, a tactical battle that you have to win?

28
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Some people will come to me without argument. You know there's some battles that you have to win. You know what's your right.

29
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And you know what they call those battles? They call them strategic battles. That's not a tactical battle anymore.

30
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If I'm in a strategic battle, I'm going to win that. And the point of saying this is as we talk about competition.

31
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And you hear Dave and me and echo getting all fired up about competition and competing all the time. And I keep saying you're always in competition and everything's competition.

32
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
As we talk about that, don't get wrapped around a tactical competition.

33
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Think strategic. Think strategic all the time.

34
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And you know you should get in some tactical scraps sometimes. So you don't lose your edge. I'm going to go ahead and say that.

35
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You want to give a little scrap. We're going to go a little sparring session. Go ahead and let's do it.

36
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But I'll tell you what, I'm not going to waste any resources. I'm definitely not going to take any significant damage.

37
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Look, I'm going to get a little dinged up. It's okay. But I'm not going to waste resources. Real resources.

38
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And here's another thing.

39
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
If you're competing against me,

40
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I will have you in tactical fights all day long.

41
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I will put tactical things out there to distract you and fight you.

42
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And I put some minimum amount of resources against your whole deal and make you think you're achieving this big victory. And you're not.

43
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I will be watching you take damage. I'll be watching you waste resources. I'll be watching you expand leadership capital while I'm putting money in the bank.

44
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I'm putting money in the bank. And I'm going to win. I am going to win.

45
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So don't mistake that as we talk through this manual. Don't mistake tactical competition for strategic competition.

46
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And we have been saying you are competing and you should remember that you are competing and you are competing all the time,

47
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
but you should be competing strategically.

48
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And with that, we can go into the book. What do you got Dave? I'm just over here taking notes.

49
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I'm just trying to write down because I'm taking this home and thinking about it.

50
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You can play a say that again.

51
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
A tactical battle that you need to win isn't a tactical battle. Just thinking even in those terms, if you have to win that battle,

52
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
meaning it's necessary.

53
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
By definition, that's not tactical. It's a strategic thing because if you didn't, if it didn't matter, then it's not strategic.

54
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
If it doesn't matter, then who cares?

55
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Just the concept of a tactical battle you need to win isn't tactical.

56
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And even on the leadership side, when people ask the question, hey, where do I hold the one? Where do I have to apply resources or expand capital?

57
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And the idea that even in reverse, if it has to be achieved, this is not a tactical thing. This is a strategic thing.

58
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And understanding that, again, that's just some of that just for me to think about because

59
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And then you ask yourself, or you see a client, or you see a human being,

60
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
treating something as if it's a strategic battle, and they don't think through it.

61
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Yeah. They don't see that.

62
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I mean, really, what's the deal? What happened? What's the worst case scenario? If you lose that battle?

63
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Well, I'm gonna, they're gonna get the op-a.

64
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Whatever thing they've rationalized inside their head, which is dragging them to expand resources, to expand leadership capital,

65
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to make someone do something because they're gonna look bad.

66
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Which is just insanity. It's total insanity.

67
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
There's almost nothing. There's almost nothing that I need to make one of my subordinates do.

68
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
There's almost, I can't, I can barely think of anything that I need to make one of my subordinates do.

69
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You know what I need to make, one of my subordinates do? I need to make sure that all my subordinates knew how to program their radios before they went out by them,

70
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
by, when on an operation in Ramadi because if they got stuck without a radio, not known how to program it, they would die.

71
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So on that, you know what I always use that example?

72
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Because there's, like, one of the few that I can possibly think of.

73
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Yeah. It's one of the few that I can possibly think of where I was like, yeah, you know what, you have to do this.

74
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now, here's why, and it's not like I had to have a big discussion. All I said was, hey guys, if you can't program your radio and you get separated, you're gonna die.

75
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Therefore, you're not going out.

76
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Did anyone say, well, actually, I don't think it's that big risk. No, everywhere yet, Roger that.

77
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
There was no, there was no discussion about it. It wasn't like an argument.

78
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It was, hey guys, I should have done a better job explaining how easy it is to get separated in an urban environment.

79
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And if you get separated in this environment, the people that would be coming to get you, they won't be us. They'll be an army unit or a Marine Corps unit,

80
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and you'll need to know how to put those frequencies into your radio by yourself.

81
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Otherwise, you'll be out there alone, and you'll get captured, and you'll have your head cut off.

82
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And it takes, by the way, 15 minutes to learn how to program a radio. Let's get it done. And everyone goes, yeah, Roger that.

83
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But there's not too many things that require that, and like I said, even that didn't require.

84
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So that didn't even cost me leadership capital.

85
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
It didn't, it actually, that, that moved, actually didn't cost me leadership capital.

86
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Instead, people like me have a man.

87
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I would venture to guess that my leadership capital went up a little bit.

88
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Because guys are thinking, mmm, I didn't know anything about that.

89
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And by the way, this guy cares about me, because he doesn't want me to be stuck in the middle of Romadi without being able to communicate.

90
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
This guy, the reason this guy wants me to do this is because he cares about me. It has nothing to do with my personal gain.

91
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Zero. What do I get out of it? Nothing.

92
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Well, I guess I'm taking care of my guys, but again, what is that? I'm taking care of my guys.

93
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The discrimination between tactical and strategic is a huge area for growth.

94
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:18.000
For us as human beings. And I think echo, this has been your constant theme since we started the podcast of the biggest lesson that you learned was long term versus short term, which is the civilian way of saying strategic long term, tactical short term, and the difference between those two.

95
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Yes, sir.

96
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And the more you figured that out, the better your life got.

97
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Yep. Just like that.

98
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
How old were you when we started this podcast?

99
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Three.

100
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Eight.

101
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Maybe 38.

102
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
There's people that are listening this podcast right now. Better thinking, I'm 32 man already went.

103
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
No, it's already too late.

104
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
No.

105
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
No.

106
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It doesn't matter.

107
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I mean, I get messages from people that are 58.

108
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And they say, you know, I'm starting to look this long term.

109
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I'm making these adjustments, and here's what I'm going to do.

110
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It's never too late.

111
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's never too late to start thinking strategic.

112
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
It's the expression about you just to like when's the best time to plan to tree or start you just to do it.

113
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Best time to plan to tree either 28 years ago or today.

114
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Same deal, man. Same exact exact same deal.

115
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Yep.

116
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Check.

117
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
All right.

118
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Chapter three.

119
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It's a short chapter, but there's a lot in it.

120
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Chapter three is called preparing for competition.

121
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So, you know, that's going to sound.

122
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
The most important task for Marines and the Marine Corps is to recognize that we are always competing.

123
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Even choosing to do nothing is a competitive decision.

124
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
It just happens to be one that surrenders the initiative to our competitors.

125
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Yes.

126
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
When you choose to do nothing, you are surrendering your the initiative to your competitor.

127
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Now, I got a throw a caveat in there that there are sometimes where tactical patients, which is the cool way of saying waiting,

128
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
is a good thing that there's absolutely times where you want to give things a second to develop.

129
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
We should say that to young seals.

130
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
If they were making calls too fast, you hey, let it develop a little bit.

131
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
You don't even know what's really happening.

132
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
You've heard four gun shots and you're trying to make a decision on which way to go.

133
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
No, let's wait till we hear some volume of fire from the enemy.

134
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So, we actually have a more relevant and real idea as to where they are.

135
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But, I think the number is seven out of ten times.

136
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Maybe eight out of ten times action is better than in action.

137
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So, that's why the Marine Corps says bias for action.

138
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
That's why echelon front says default aggressive.

139
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It's better to make a move.

140
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Eight out of ten times nine out of ten times.

141
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It's better to make a move.

142
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And if you have an open mind and you're going to read a feedback loop, it almost becomes ten out of ten.

143
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And if you're going to do iterative decision making, meaning I'm going to make a small move really quickly, then it becomes a hundred percent.

144
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I'm going to make a really quick move.

145
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I'm going to then read the feedback loop and see what I've got.

146
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And if you can do that, which is what I do, that's how I cheated.

147
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
That's how I cheat in decision making.

148
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I don't make a big decision.

149
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I'm going to make a little one.

150
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Make a little tiny decision.

151
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Yeah, it does kind of the more you think about it, the more it becomes like, yeah, like a ten out of ten.

152
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Especially when you think of it in those terms where, yeah, the photographs of not meaning you're going all out full speed one direction every single time.

153
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
But that was like, you got to be because it kind of comes from a mindset, right?

154
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Where it obviously default aggressive does.

155
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:59.000
But if taking action versus not taking action, if you just reduce it just to the mindset, like then you can kind of understand like, oh yeah, to not take action is with very few if any exceptions, the wrong thing to do.

156
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Yeah, especially when you consider what action, how small an action can be.

157
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Yes.

158
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And still be action.

159
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Right.

160
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Exactly.

161
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Yeah.

162
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Because like has a hesitation, right?

163
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
That's what you don't want.

164
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The hesitation.

165
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
That's like an action.

166
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
That's like, I'm not making any decision to hold here or anticipate this.

167
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I'm not making a decision.

168
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I'm just like hesitating kind of thing.

169
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Like just not doing that.

170
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Yeah, and when you think about like immediate action drills, which you'll have, you know, in a platoon where if we get, if we get,

171
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
if we get shot at, here's the immediate action is going to happen without anything.

172
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
There's action happening with no call being made.

173
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
No decisions been made, but there's action happening.

174
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Dave, I apologize for not have that I haven't memorized this immediate action that you have in a jet and it's some move that you make when you don't know what else to do, but you just do it.

175
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
What is it?

176
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Lift, right?

177
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Yes.

178
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Lift, vector, on and pull.

179
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
That's an action.

180
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yep.

181
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And that action, you can take that immediately.

182
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And then you can figure out what you're going to do.

183
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
That's right.

184
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So it's good to think through those things.

185
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000
It's good if you can just think about, if you can just have an SOP or standard operating procedure that, hey, if this happens, I know I'm at least going to do this.

186
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
That's a really positive thing.

187
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Yeah, I'm rackin' my brain kind of trying to think of a time we're doing nothing and you already said it.

188
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I think the thing I was thinking about is even the smallest move, even the smallest decision that to do anything.

189
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You interact with the environment, somehow and get some feedback.

190
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You get something.

191
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Now that something could be very little and okay cool then I can move a little bit more.

192
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
But even the smallest move gives you something.

193
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So thinking of it in those terms, it's really hard and I'm just thinking of an, an example.

194
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We're doing nothing and I can't, I can't think of one.

195
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
When the alternative is, hey, make a really small move.

196
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Just to see what you get in that feedback loop, just to see what kind of return you get on that.

197
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And even if the return is like all negative, it's such a small move that the risk of even that 100% negative feedback is like, hey, that's good information.

198
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
That hasn't toppled us over across us.

199
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So even if the response is all bad, the move is so small that's actually good for you.

200
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So I just can't pee some and gather we go, no actually, here's the time where I really think doing nothing is right.

201
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
When that is the alternative we're thinking about.

202
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Right, right, and when you when you factor in the small iterative decisions, it really eliminates a lot of inaction being good.

203
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And neither one of us and none of us are saying that that's never the case.

204
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
But definitely lean towards the bias for action, definitely lean towards default aggressive.

205
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
That's where you want to go and then lean with little footsteps.

206
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And I think we're where people get hung up on this and we talk about this a lot. The way you describe it.

207
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
You're iterative decision making, the way you do it happens so quickly and so rapidly.

208
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
It appears that you're just going from here all the way to there.

209
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
So from the outside, it looks like you're making these huge moves.

210
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And the reason you say you're cheating is you're going to, I know that's what it looks like.

211
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
But that's not what's happening.

212
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
If you look at it like, hey, you're going from here all the way to there.

213
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And you're thinking, I don't know how to do that yet. So I'm going to do nothing.

214
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
If that's your frame of reference, I understand why doing nothing is, is a reason of alternative.

215
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
What is, what you don't understand is that you're not doing that.

216
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You never go from here all the way to there.

217
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
You have a thousand little moves along the way, but that happens so quickly.

218
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And the maneuvers are so fast that it doesn't appear like that.

219
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And if that's all you think is, oh, he just, jocca just goes from here to there.

220
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
You know, like, that's actually not happening.

221
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Yeah, and what's interesting about what you're saying is,

222
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I don't think anyone thinks I'm going all the way from that here from point A to point F.

223
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I don't think they think that I think that they don't even know if we should go to point F or point Z or point Y.

224
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And so they're just they haven't made any decision whatsoever.

225
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Yeah, meanwhile I go, go to be, that's right.

226
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
You're not saying go to F.

227
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Yeah, I'm saying go to B.

228
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And meanwhile, they don't even know where to go, but then I all of a sudden say, hey, we're going to be right now.

229
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I never goes, oh damn, how did you know to go to B?

230
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Because B is only a little training ways away, but everybody thinks that's a big move.

231
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Because they were trying to calculate, they were trying to try to do that.

232
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
That's calculus for a giant.

233
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And that's what leads to doing nothing.

234
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And that's what leads to doing nothing.

235
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Because you can't do that calculus.

236
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And by the way, what helps you do the calculus?

237
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Well, it helps you do the calculus when you start filling into the variables.

238
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
What starts filling in the variables is when you start gathering information.

239
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And when you start gathering this information, you start filling in those variables.

240
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And like you said, even if that variable is negative,

241
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
and we go, oh, there's more enemy to the west.

242
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Okay, cool. Now guess what we know.

243
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
We're not going west.

244
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
We can start moving east.

245
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We can start moving south.

246
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Whereas if we just sat there, we still don't know where to go.

247
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
We don't know where to go.

248
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
We don't know where to go.

249
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
East west north south.

250
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
We don't know where to go.

251
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So that small movement to the east.

252
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
We're all hey, we just identified more variables.

253
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Okay, cool.

254
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Now we know not to go there.

255
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So there's the opening sentence.

256
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Competition in the Marine Corps.

257
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Marines and the Marine Corps are tools for the nation to, by the way.

258
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:28.000
You know, the people talk about like what's the greatest speech that's ever been delivered.

259
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
You know, is it Martin Luther King?

260
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Is it Winston Churchill?

261
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Is it Teddy Roosevelt?

262
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
You know, we have nothing to fear, but it's which one of those speeches is the greatest speech ever?

263
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And no one's ever asked me this question in a public form where I could answer this question the way I want to answer this question.

264
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
But,

265
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Chesty Polar.

266
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Give a speech at like some Marine Corps ball gathering.

267
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And he was already retired.

268
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
He was already Chesty Polar.

269
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And, you know, they call him up to give the speech that he's going to give.

270
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And the freaking place goes completely nuts, obviously.

271
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
And he gets up there.

272
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
And he delivers what I believe to be.

273
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
At least a strong contender, at least for me, the greatest speech of all time.

274
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And he already says.

275
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
He just says,

276
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Marines.

277
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And that's it.

278
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
The place went freaking nuts.

279
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And he walked off the stage.

280
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
So, whenever I see the word Marines, I think of that.

281
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
That's all he needed to say.

282
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:56.000
So, Marines and the Marine Corps are tools for the nation to use in the enduring competition that takes place in international relations.

283
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So, what does that mean?

284
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
That means every single thing that you do.

285
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Every single thing that you do is playing into this competition that you're in in all these different aspects.

286
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Every day, Marine capabilities and force posture affect the thinking of our competitors and potential adversaries.

287
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Again, this is to propaganda for the Marine Corps.

288
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
In case me talking about Chesty Polar saying Marines isn't good enough for propaganda for the Marine Corps.

289
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
We are credible the Marine Corps. The more attractive we are to allies and partners.

290
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000
The more credible the Marine Corps is as a deterrent force, the more we affect potential rivals thinking.

291
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
For Marines, participation in our nation's competitions starts at recruitment.

292
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
The quality level of individuals brought into the service provides the raw material to build a credible force.

293
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Attributes like education, level physical fitness and mental resilience determine how quickly these individuals

294
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
can be transformed into members of a coherent capable organization.

295
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:08.000
These attributes also help establish the range of possibilities available to adapt the existing force or innovate to create a new one.

296
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
How much do you know about Marine Corps recruiting Dave?

297
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I mean, I have my own personal experience with it. I don't know if I'm an expert on it, but I have a small sense of how it works.

298
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:31.000
The rumor that I've always heard about the Marine Corps is that the Marine Corps spends like a fraction of the amount of money that the Navy, the Army and the Air Force spend on recruiting.

299
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Do you know anything about that?

300
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I can't give you any facts on that. That wouldn't surprise me, but I couldn't prove that.

301
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Yeah, that's what I've always heard. I believe between now I know that they must spend some money because they have advertisements and they have, you know, commercials and stuff like that.

302
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
But then they do a good job based on narrative alone.

303
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I mean, my recollection of when I was really getting into thinking about the Marine Corps was the way that one of the ways I was convinced is it made it sound like it was probably impossible.

304
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Like they were recruiting like, you're probably not good enough.

305
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Yeah.

306
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
But if you are, this is where you should be and there's this sense of like, oh man.

307
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Now Dakota Myers almost the exact same story. You know, he showed up and I forget what kind of crazy. He was talking about he had some crazy like haircut, whatever.

308
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000
He was a punk ass kid and he shows up and says, I want to be in the Marine Corps and they said, you don't really look like your Marine Corps material.

309
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Yeah.

310
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Now, do you think this is when you go to recruiting school?

311
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Are they teaching you that as a recruiter?

312
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
I'm pretty sure that's a technique that they leverage.

313
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Now, what's interesting is J.P. to now same thing walked into the Navy recruiter.

314
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
I want to be a Navy seat or I should probably like, I want to be a Navy seat.

315
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Because he's 14 years old, wherever he was.

316
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And they said, eh, the wannabe's need to come in on Thursday.

317
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
What do you want to be?

318
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:05.000
And he was determined to just approve that freaking recruiter in Sacramento, California, that J.P. had what it took.

319
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
It's a great screening tool because I know the Marine Corps wants people that think that they want,

320
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
they want people that have big egos in the sense that they think they can do things in their heart.

321
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
And a great way to test that is, hey, this is too hard for you.

322
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
And if you go, yeah, you're right.

323
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
They don't want you anyway.

324
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
What they want us to go, well, really.

325
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
So I would say I'm pretty sure that that is a technique that they proliferate throughout officer and

326
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
enlisted recruiting is you're probably not good enough, but we'll see.

327
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Now, what percentage of people does that backfire? The humble guy that's a super stud that says, hey, you know, probably, I guess I'm not just, I'm probably not just cut out for it.

328
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And I guess maybe that is a good self selection because now we got to do that maybe at the moment a truth kick, I'm really believe in his capabilities.

329
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Very strange.

330
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Historically, the Marine Corps has been the nation's hybrid force.

331
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Conducting activities that straddle the line between violence and nonviolence.

332
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Marines have often deployed two places to help the local people in time of need while being ready to restore order in those same places if required.

333
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:26.000
The direction for the Marine Corps to be the most ready when the nation is least ready applies as much to competition as it does to war.

334
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And this is another one of these statements where you think, well, that that's a good idea.

335
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Well, that that that right there is a maneuver to the Department of Defense to give us money.

336
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:45.000
You need to allocate money to the Marine Corps because when the nation is least ready, the Marine Corps will be the most ready.

337
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.000
In fact, this statement can be viewed as a competitive act in the informational element of national power.

338
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Next section is called campaigning mindset.

339
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Competition is in and I you know, I love the word campaign.

340
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Why? Because because that's the opposite of tactical battle.

341
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
That's the opposite of a hack. It's the opposite of a shortcut.

342
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
It's an opposite of this easy solution, the sweatless solution as Colonel David Hackworth once said.

343
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
It's a campaign. Campaigns don't happen overnight.

344
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Competition is enduring in nature at the national level and the military element normally plays a supporting role, especially on the spectrum of competition short of war.

345
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:48.000
This leads us to develop a campaigning mindset about competition, which is characterized by long term thinking and recognition that we need to integrate our actions with others.

346
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:59.000
The Marines compete as part of a naval and joint force, but also as part of the interagency in an approach that combines all the elements of national power.

347
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Now it's sentences like this where I think this this document is not aimed at a landscorpor.

348
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
This document is aimed at the DOD. This is a campaign. This document is a campaign.

349
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
It's correct.

350
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
But this document is a campaign to make sure that we keep the Marine Corps strong.

351
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Marines should strive to integrate our allies and partners into our competitions as this will increase our options,

352
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
while also increasing the potential number of dilemmas we can present to our rivals.

353
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
What are we going to get to this?

354
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I don't know if it's in this chapter or one of the later chapters when we start talking about.

355
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
One of my favorite military terms that combined arm dilemma.

356
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
But when you think about what you're doing is creating dilemmas for your rivals,

357
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
even in not necessarily in a wartime scenario, but even in a competitive scenario,

358
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
or a threshold less than violence you're trying to create dilemmas for them.

359
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
It's a powerful thing.

360
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:12.000
The cultivation of humility is also important for this mindset.

361
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Marine's learned early on about the observed orient-decide act loop or utaloop.

362
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Understanding of Uda teaches us that it's important to learn how to learn how to learn.

363
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:50.000
About the observed orient-decide act loop or utaloop. Understanding of Uda teaches us that each decision is a hypothesis that gets tested in the real world when we act.

364
00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:06.000
I'm talking to clients and I'm talking to clients as COVID kicked off. I had this little speel that I was giving them.

365
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Basically what I was saying is, hey, if you're in a leadership position and you're not sure what to do, what you got to do in that situation, you got to guess.

366
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
I've got to go off about, guess I'd say, listen, everybody, no one wants to hear the word guess.

367
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Hey Dave, you're in charge. What do you want me to do? Let me take a guess. No one wants to hear that. That sounds horrible.

368
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Who wants to follow somebody that I guess we should have you ever heard a leader in your life that was inspiring with confidence when they said, hey, I'm guessing we should go over there.

369
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
You don't say that as a leader. You don't use those words.

370
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:46.000
And yet, and then I've followed up and say, but when you're in a leadership position, when you are making a decision, what you're calling a decision, it is a guess.

371
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.000
And what the Marine Corps did here, because they didn't want to use the word guess, they sent us up into the next level and just called it a hypothesis.

372
00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Which is a guess, which is an educated guess, which is still a guess. But the amount of times that you are in a leadership position where you know for certain what's going to happen next is 0.001% because we can't predict the future.

373
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
We don't know what all these little variables are, how all these little variables are going to turn out.

374
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000
So that's what we're doing as leaders is we're making guesses. We're making hypotheses. We're taking what you say educated guesses.

375
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
That's like in between, right? A guess is just a guess. An educated guess next level hypothesis.

376
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Yes, sir.

377
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000
So we've got to understand that. We understand that that decision is a hypothesis that gets tested in the real world when we actually act.

378
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000
The campaigning mindset then includes the understanding that we base our plans on a model we created of our competitor.

379
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Okay? Our decisions about how to achieve our goals and competition are theories.

380
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Their guesses.

381
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Why do guess work going on?

382
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:09.000
And what's good, what I like about using the word guess, what I like about that is I think, you know, Dave, you were talking earlier about hesitation if you're making an indiscision making process.

383
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Well, if I'm a young leader and I'm looking at my options A, B, or C.

384
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And I'm not sure which one to do.

385
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
I might be thinking in my mind, well, what am I supposed to do? Just guess.

386
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
I suppose to just take an educated guess with what we should do right now. I got all these resources. I got maybe lives at stake or I got a capital to take.

387
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
I got all these things going on. I don't feel comfortable just guessing. So I'm just going to sit here.

388
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And wait, because I'm scared, because I, I doesn't seem right that I should be guessing what to do. Yes, you should.

389
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Now, what I recommend you do is you guess little. Just take a little guess. Hey, should I go and door A, B, or C?

390
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
You know what I'm going to do immediately? Hey, I'm going to walk up that door and take a listen. What are I here in there?

391
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Right? Is there a party going on? Or is there gunfire?

392
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So, or is there no noise? Now, no noise on a little scared about, but if I hear music, that's kind of a positive sign.

393
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
But I didn't enter the door. All I did was put my ear up to it.

394
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
So that's what you do. You make a little guess. I guess we should check out that door. I hear gunfire.

395
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.000
That doesn't sound like a good door. What about the next door? I hear nothing. Not sure about that one. What about this door over here? I hear music.

396
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:34.000
I hear music that echo Charles plays in his vehicle from the islands, which means everyone in that room is kind of cruising.

397
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And I'm feeling pretty good about it. We're opening that door. No factor.

398
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000
So, if you're not comfortable taking a guess, then it's hard to make a decision.

399
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Our plans then need to have feedback loops built into them to either confirm that our models and theories are correct.

400
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Enough to help us reach our goals or that we need to modify them.

401
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And by the way, they don't bring this back up to humility they should.

402
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Because if you're not humble and you think I'm guessing door C and you walk up to it, you hear gunshot you like, well, I guess C we're going in.

403
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Bad idea. So it takes humility to modify your plan. And if you're not humble, you won't be modifying your plan. You'll be sticking with your plan until it kills you.

404
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Competition campaigning introduces the idea of persistence. Strategic competition is more like a marathon than a sprint.

405
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Competition's enduring nature means that 80 campaign will require long-term commitment to achieve its goals.

406
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000
We also need to be alert for how our competitive advantages and those of our rivals will shift over time.

407
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:57.000
This is what's scary about wars like Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, where your enemy is home.

408
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000
They're not on deployment. They're going to be there. And when the wars, they'll be there for 100 years.

409
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:15.000
There's not an American that wants to be there. There's not an American that's, hey, I'm stoked. I'm in Al-Kain.

410
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Hey, I'm stoked. I mean, cut. Hey, I'm stoked. Wherever. They want to be back in Nebraska.

411
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000
They want to be back in Iowa. But the people that are we're fighting against, they are home.

412
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
So before you get into that combat, you got to figure out who's got the home field advantage.

413
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
It's a big deal. It's a way bigger deal than it is in sports.

414
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
This next section is professionalism.

415
00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:03.000
As military professionals charged with the defense of the nation, marine leaders must be true experts in the conduct of war.

416
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:15.000
This statement from war fighting, the MCDP1 war fighting establishes the first priority for Marines, which is the definition.

417
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:27.000
The professionals, Marines recognize this defense as a vital and enduring national interest. Our professionalism is grounded in our nation's values, which sets us apart from our, from competitors.

418
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Achieving that standard, being prepared to defend the nation has been and will continue to be a competitive act.

419
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000
So us just being ready is, is, is how we are helping America compete with everybody else in the world because they got to keep up. You see what the Marine Corps is doing?

420
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
You know you better be training hard.

421
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
We accept that the existence of the Marine Corps helps to turn potential foes.

422
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Our goal is for that deterrence to take place below the violence threshold.

423
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:13.000
So what we're doing right there, we're kind of making sure that even the doves in the government are looking at the Marine Corps thinking, you know, the Marine Corps doesn't want war either.

424
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
The Marine Corps wants peace. They want to they want these things to happen below that we better give them more money.

425
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Well funded Marine Corps professionals understand this goal and thus direct their energies, self-study and unit development in particular toward achieving it.

426
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000
So all Marines are trying to become professionals.

427
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Professionals.

428
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
True experts in the conduct of war.

429
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000
As professionals, we recognize that development of coercive tools must be balanced with the need to attract in competition as well.

430
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
For example, one component of the Attraction Strategy could lead to greater deterrence through building increased interoperability with an ally.

431
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
It could also lead to advances through the informal element of national power as we perform disaster relief mission.

432
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Marines must remain alert for the opportunities to use and integrate both coercion and attraction into the larger competition.

433
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
So the Marine Corps is not they're saying here we're not just here to fight wars.

434
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
We're here to build relationships. Now at echelon front, we talk about building relationships all the time.

435
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
That's how you lead. You lead by building relationships. That's how you get things done by building relationships.

436
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And what we're talking about here is we are competing.

437
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And in order to compete, guess what we do.

438
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
We build relationships.

439
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And just to get people example.

440
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000
And I'm sure you have some more Dave, but especially before the war started for me in the 90s.

441
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
This is what the seal teams did.

442
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Go to a country train their special operations unit.

443
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Do a big exercise.

444
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Train them in the use of our weapons.

445
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
We train in the use of their weapons.

446
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
We send some people to learn how to speak their language.

447
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
We bring some people to learn that they can learn how to speak English.

448
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
We form these relationships. We work together.

449
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
So that way we're strengthening our allies.

450
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
We have somebody we can rely upon.

451
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
We get to know them.

452
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
That's just relationships. That's what it is.

453
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Did you guys do that in the pilot world?

454
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about carrier deployments.

455
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And I think right now there's a connotation that the aircraft carrier.

456
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And it's by already always existed.

457
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
But certainly now since post 911,

458
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000
the carriers, this power projection tool, this 90,000 tons of diplomacy,

459
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
sovereign US soil all over the way.

460
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
They have these great taglines.

461
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
The navy leverages which are true in a lot of ways.

462
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
But pre 911, if you ever did a cruise, pre 911,

463
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
like I did back in the day, the joke,

464
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
we called them pleasure cruises.

465
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
It was like 13, 14 port calls.

466
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
And the two months that you sailed from San Diego to the Persian Gulf,

467
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
was a bunch of port calls.

468
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
You're doing joint operations with different countries.

469
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
You're pulling up here,

470
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
side and contributing to their economy.

471
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
You're building all those relationships.

472
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
And most of it is allies or people we want to build relationships with.

473
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
And you go to the Gulf for a couple months.

474
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Do that thing.

475
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
And in that, you're doing three or four port calls to barrain.

476
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
The UAE, all these places where we're trying to strengthen relationships.

477
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
And that that carrier was an instrument of power projection.

478
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
It was an instrument of diplomacy,

479
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
which was building those relationships.

480
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Obviously, post 911, my experience, my second cruise,

481
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
was like go to the North Arabian Gulf,

482
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
stay there for seven months.

483
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Come home.

484
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
But before that, the investment that Navy was making

485
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
was mostly strengthening the relationships.

486
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And there are stories out there, even somewhat recently,

487
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
that carriers would deploy for disaster relief with no aircraft on them,

488
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
just to send a carrier to help floods and crazy things that happen

489
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
in different places,

490
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
strictly for strengthening ties and relationships

491
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
that are projecting literal no combat power.

492
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
By design because the Navy see,

493
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
well, I'm sure it's larger than just the Navy,

494
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
but that's my connection.

495
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
And I'd deploy it off carriers for the most part.

496
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
So that's attraction.

497
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
That's attraction as opposed to the chance.

498
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
We're just trying to show people,

499
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
hey, you want to be friends with us.

500
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
We're attractive.

501
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
We can help you if you get no time to need.

502
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
We're a good ally at a tactical level

503
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
when I would deploy in the 90s.

504
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Perk and a curve.

505
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
We would go out and do exercises

506
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
where I would be in the jungle.

507
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
With some special operations unit from some other country.

508
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
What do you do when you are a fighter pilot?

509
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Same thing.

510
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Are you giving them a tour?

511
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Are you taking them in the backseat?

512
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Like, at a tactical level,

513
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
just out of my own curiosity.

514
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
What would you do?

515
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
You're flying with them.

516
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
You're spending time with them.

517
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
And there's a little bit of a way.

518
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Are they flying their aircraft?

519
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
And so you're there, you're wingman,

520
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
and you work with them.

521
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Yeah, you're integrating with them.

522
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Sometimes you fight against them.

523
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Sometimes you fight with them.

524
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Really what it's supposed to be is because you ever put your ego in check

525
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
and let one of these,

526
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
let one of these foreigners beat you in a dogfight.

527
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

528
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Zero percent chance.

529
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Zero.

530
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Now, certain countries,

531
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
they would have,

532
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
we would fly with different countries that they would have different

533
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
ROE, different rules, training rules and things like that.

534
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
And you could see some of them were geared very specifically

535
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
to make sure that certain people had advantages.

536
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
And we would play by those rules and sometimes get in trouble

537
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
for not following those rules.

538
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
You know, one of the things that's really cool about the American military,

539
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
and certainly in aviation.

540
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
And there's a saying we have,

541
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
I think there's no rank in the cockpit.

542
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
So I could be the junior doing the squadron.

543
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
I'm not saying this happened very often,

544
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
but you could be a middle-level guy.

545
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
You're going to go out, fly with your boss.

546
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And once you start fighting him,

547
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
like you can pummel him to just pummel him into the ground.

548
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
And it's, there is no like,

549
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
death-friends like, I don't want to make the old man look bad.

550
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
You go out there and do your thing.

551
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
That's not always like that.

552
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
But the interaction, in some sense,

553
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
was this idea that this American military with this big,

554
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
this big power aviation world is something they can learn from.

555
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
But we always learned stuff from them too.

556
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
We would share briefing techniques and how they ran their briefs,

557
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
how they trained their guys,

558
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
how they did certain things.

559
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
And a lot of it,

560
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
at least on paper, was for us to bring to them,

561
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
things that could help them get better.

562
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
But it was always reciprocal.

563
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
We always learned from operating with other countries.

564
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
And I flew with pilots and airplanes from all sorts of different countries.

565
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Even sometimes the same exact airplane,

566
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
but they fly at differently.

567
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
They do things differently.

568
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
So there's a whole bunch of things that you can do to interact with them.

569
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
That is beneficial for both.

570
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
It was probably the opposite.

571
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
What we knew and how we did it was using more,

572
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
more beneficial to them,

573
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
but it wasn't completely one side at either.

574
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Find dissimilar with different countries is a blast,

575
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
because you learned stuff to go, oh man,

576
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
we don't do that in our airplanes.

577
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
That's really good for me to see.

578
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I think it would be more prepared for if something actually really happens.

579
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Would you guys go toe to toe, top gone,

580
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
dog fight style, one on one?

581
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Yeah, you'd have different things.

582
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
I have never been in a situation where if the brief was you and me

583
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
are going to fight, I don't care,

584
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
what country or what plan once fights on,

585
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
it is game on.

586
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
There is no like, hey, go easy on this guy or lift this guy.

587
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
I have never been in a dog fight once in my life.

588
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Other than, hey, I'm, they're going to show you certain things.

589
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
But if it's like a real dog fight,

590
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
like just a real fight, you're just, you fight your best airplane.

591
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.000
There are times that you would dial back your best jet because it'd be really,

592
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
it would undermine the effectiveness of the training of the relationship

593
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
of the big as well.

594
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
But it never, like, oh, you did,

595
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
we're eating, never good job.

596
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
You really caught me off guard there.

597
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

598
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
You got me.

599
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
That would be, you know, in the heyday of can you when you're a top

600
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
guy and I pee and you're fighting against somebody else.

601
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
And you're going to come back, no joke.

602
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
You come back with 25 30 valid shots.

603
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
That can be really disheartening for somebody who look on paper and go,

604
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
hey, let me see your shot card and they've got zero shots.

605
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And you're like, oh, hang on, I need to get my second sheet of paper.

606
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
And if there's a top guy and I pee or a web school IP listeners,

607
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
they're laughing right?

608
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
You can come back with in four or five sets, five six shots per and you have 30 valid shots.

609
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And the other guy's got zero.

610
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
If you do that set after set after set after set after set after a while,

611
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
it'd be like you and me rolling on the mats and you doing nothing but trying to beat me.

612
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
You're not teaching me and not training me.

613
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
You're just going to beat me and like, bro, what would?

614
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
I don't want to do this anymore.

615
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
So you would dial that back.

616
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
But you never be like, oh, Dave, that was amazing.

617
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
How you did that.

618
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I didn't think you could, you would never get to that level of that in an actual fight.

619
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
When we're training and doing other things, yeah, you're there to learn and they learn from you

620
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
and they learn from them.

621
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000
But I've never been in a one-one V-one where I'm dialing it back because somebody needs somebody saying,

622
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
hey, don't fight your best gen.

623
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
I'm only doing that in a tactical sense of helping him see sight pictures and maneuvering in a way that's benefiting him.

624
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
But not like, because I feel bad or something like that.

625
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Are the personalities of the foreign countries, fighter pilots similar to Americans?

626
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Yeah, one of the things, I'd be interested in what you saw with special forces around the world.

627
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
What I came to find is, despite what appears to be a whole bunch of differences between different countries when it came down to it,

628
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
the personality of fighter pilots are really similar.

629
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
There are differences.

630
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
There are some cultural things, there are some organizational things.

631
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:30.000
But at the end of the day, fighter pilots that fight fighters in any country and every type of fighter, they're much more similar than they are different.

632
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Yeah, same thing with special operations.

633
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
There's definitely some differences in culture and whatnot.

634
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
It's a pretty thin layer that you have to pull back and all of a sudden.

635
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Oh, these guys are kind of just like us.

636
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
The mentality of the totally.

637
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
From a maintenance perspective.

638
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000
It seems like just the American sort of, from manufacturing to maintenance,

639
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
the maintenance programs and the Navy, even in the SEAL teams, we would especially.

640
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Before the once the war started, we kind of we saw less of the Navy kind of administrative stuff on our inside the terms.

641
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.000
But when the 90s it was like, hey, you got to do these protocols that the big Navy follows and so you'd see, oh, well, you know, these guys are square to weather.

642
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:33.000
The Navy is square to wait. There's a reason that when you when you pull a piece of firefighting gear off of a wall on a ship that's been there for three years.

643
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
It works. It works because it's gone through this maintenance check. It's gone through every 30 days and every 90 days.

644
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:45.000
It's gotten this and it's got this and the other thing is, are there are, do foreign countries have that same level of.

645
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Being square to away from a maintenance perspective.

646
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000
You know, I don't know if I ever got to that level that layer of fidelity.

647
00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:05.000
I will say that the American military, certainly the Navy and the Marine Corps, I get most of my experience with, that is something we take really, really seriously.

648
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.000
And what you just described is the equipment that we have, the things we have as old as they are, whatever, the things we have work.

649
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And that when I'm manned up an aircraft, I never once got an airplane and felt like kind of sketchy about it. Never once did I get an airplane and not feel like I'm getting an airplane.

650
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:36.000
And I'm not sure if that's true for other countries or other other services outside of America, but I always, and I've flown with the Navy a lot, I've owned the Marine Corps a lot, I've owned the Air Force a lot, and that is universal.

651
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.000
So I have a different feeling and I have gotten into aircraft and been completely sketched out with both my fingers crossed, hoping that this thing is going to make it.

652
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
And in all those cases, it was an aircraft that was not an American military aircraft in your country.

653
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Well, I guess this is good go down like that, this could be it.

654
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
I never had the best feeling.

655
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000
And what's weird is, you know, the other thing about the American military aircraft is not working, man.

656
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Like the Navy helicopters, they're just, they're daily drivers.

657
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:17.000
They're daily driver, a CH-46, a Navy CH-46, that thing is a daily driver.

658
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
That thing is a Ford F-150, that's just ready.

659
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
You have to think it's going to do its job.

660
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:32.000
So I always felt, even though there'd be hydraulic fluid all over the deck and it would be a little bit, it would look sketchy.

661
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
But you know that that thing's been flying.

662
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Well, first of all, how old is CH-46 platform?

663
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
19 early 1960s.

664
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
And some of those birds are from the 1960s.

665
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Still flying.

666
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Well, at least they were still flying when I was in.

667
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Yeah.

668
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
All right, little tangent right there.

669
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
And what's interesting is everything we just talked about.

670
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
All plays, that's what this whole book is about. It's about competition.

671
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
But it's all those things that's the reason I was kind of diving into it.

672
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000
It's all these things are how we are competing with our allies and with our rivals.

673
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
And we're letting everybody know that this is what we've got.

674
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
And these are capabilities and this is what we can do.

675
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Like that's all part of the game.

676
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Yeah.

677
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And I was thinking that that tangent was also like, that's what makes us professionals.

678
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
That's the profession of what we're doing.

679
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
It's not a hobby.

680
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
As fun as it is, it's flying airplanes, all those are professional things.

681
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
And that's when we're working with other countries.

682
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
The one thing I will say this is that I know when you're going to fight someone

683
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
outside of your squadron.

684
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
So another squadron.

685
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
And then outside of the service, like we're going to go with the air force.

686
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
You had the sense of like, you're going to be on your A game.

687
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
When we were fighting with other countries, it was like, you,

688
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
you were going to show them your absolute best game in everything we do

689
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
from brief to shut down and everything in between.

690
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
So there was a sense of looking the part and that every step away from your squadron

691
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
from your bros that went up higher.

692
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Like don't you go fight with the air force and embarrass us?

693
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
And when you're fighting with foreign countries,

694
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
the need to look professional was absolutely understood.

695
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Verbalized at all or no?

696
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Absolutely.

697
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Absolutely.

698
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Check.

699
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Who would you train with?

700
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Like for example, like what other country?

701
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.000
I mean, okay, so I have trained personally with Canadians, Australians,

702
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Brits, Saudis, Emirates, Kuwaitis, Singapore, Malaysia.

703
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
I'm running out there's more.

704
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
These are all just interfaces or services.

705
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Your country that fly different airplanes or interacted in some way.

706
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Japan, a whole bunch of countries.

707
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Do you ever fly their planes?

708
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000
So every, you said something.

709
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
I'm kind of laughing at it and I didn't know we're going to circle back to it.

710
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Every single time you go to this kind of the last day or two, you have some graduation

711
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
thing and they're always offering, hey, you jump in there.

712
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
And remember, I flew single-seater planes.

713
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
So it wasn't always that we could do that.

714
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
But if there's a two-seat jet or something, we always offering.

715
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
And they're always offering us, hey, jump in the back seat.

716
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
I never once, never once.

717
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
I don't want to be in the back seat.

718
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
First of all, of anything.

719
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Certainly not a former Soviet Union,

720
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
but in the middle of the day,

721
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
I never got in the back seat of somebody else's airplane.

722
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
You were busy.

723
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Couldn't do it that day.

724
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Not available.

725
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
And that I think is what you're saying.

726
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
I don't know anything about anything.

727
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
I don't know anything about this airplane.

728
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Yeah.

729
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
First of all, I don't want anything to be the back seat.

730
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
I don't know if the cool, and guys would kill for that stuff.

731
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
And I never wanted to do it.

732
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Being a back of a flanker or a maid or something.

733
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Go for a good.

734
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
That's all you.

735
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Yeah.

736
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Sometimes you'd have the same planes, don't we?

737
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Yeah.

738
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Yeah.

739
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Canadians, Australians, we play the exact same airplanes.

740
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
It's the like in the sealed teams.

741
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
If you're going to do something, you're in some foreign aircraft.

742
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
The only way to get out of it would be to basically quit.

743
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
You know, you can't say, well, hey, guys,

744
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
I'm not really comfortable with this aircraft.

745
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
And so you're sitting there in a squad.

746
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
And every single one of those,

747
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.000
there's probably like there's everything one of those guys is thinking, we should not be doing this.

748
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
And every single one of those guys doesn't say,

749
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
I've worked about it, gets on that bird, and goes and does what you got to do.

750
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Not me.

751
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Back to the book, Warfighting also instructs that the quote,

752
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Military Profession is a thinking profession.

753
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
End quote.

754
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
This means that Marines must practice mental,

755
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
the mental discipline necessary to challenge our assumptions.

756
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
As professionals, we need to disproportionately assess the environment and make certain we are setting the pace for our competitors.

757
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
I was on with a client the other day.

758
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And well, you know, the lead into the question that I got asked was, well, you know, in the military, of course,

759
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000
it's a, it's a very hierarchy structure thing.

760
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
And what you want is people at all think the same way.

761
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
You know, that was the lead into the question.

762
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
So any ask the question, then I had to start with,

763
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
let me just tell you that the last thing I want on my team is a bunch of people that think the same way I do.

764
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Actually, I want a bunch of people that push back and think different thoughts and see different perspectives than me.

765
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
And so here's the Marine Corps, quoting from their, their manual number one,

766
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
which is called Warfighting Military Profession is a thinking profession.

767
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
And it takes discipline to challenge our own assumptions.

768
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Again, it's totally, the complete opposite of what everyone thinks the Marine Corps is.

769
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Everybody thinks everyone want the old. We want every Marine to think the same. No, you don't.

770
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
We want them to actually, it's actually we're being instructed to challenge our own assumptions.

771
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Yeah, I like that connection to you were talking earlier about wanting to see this thing connect back to humility,

772
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
which was that sentence kind of started this.

773
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
And that there is, there is an undeniable connection there.

774
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:02.000
The mental discipline necessarily challenged our own assumptions. The humility that it takes to go and look at your own,

775
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
guess your own assumption to go, I might be wrong.

776
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
The humility inside of that and they're calling it mental discipline,

777
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
but those two are completely linked.

778
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
And even if you just think about the things you say, the self discipline it takes for you to do the things that you do is discipline as you are.

779
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
The reason you do it is that you don't want to get complacent.

780
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
You don't want to get comfortable. You don't want to get weak. So you have the mental discipline to do that.

781
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
And that is humility.

782
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Because if you don't, I can skip a day.

783
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
I just skip a couple days, whatever.

784
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Either a lack of mental discipline or a lack of humility will lead you to not challenge your assumptions and just think that everything is going fine.

785
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And we'll just go through with it.

786
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
My plan's good to go.

787
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Yeah.

788
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Next section is education.

789
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000
But before we go into this next section, let me ask you this.

790
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Do you remember when I was talking about diving and not wanting to be the buddy?

791
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Yeah.

792
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Totally.

793
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:03.000
So that was, I think when we were talking about it, I was just, you know, the single seat mindset of my experience.

794
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000
You know, is it a similar thing where if you're in the back seat, you're just kind of not in control and you're not much to do and you're sort of,

795
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Yeah, I mean, that was for me.

796
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
And there were guys just like me that had no problem sitting in the back seat.

797
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:29.000
If, if you lined up like 10 fighter pilots today and like, hey, do you want to go fly in the back seat of an authentic P51 from World War II?

798
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Nine of them would be in there like this and I would say no thanks.

799
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
So it could even be a hundred or ninety nine of them would say I'll be in there.

800
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Just about every one of you in there, I'm not even a pilot.

801
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Yeah.

802
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
And I understand that the historical significance of it.

803
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:53.000
And I'm not even sure it's rational to even think that, but I never, ever, ever, even even wanting to fly a two-seat airplane.

804
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000
I didn't want to do that because I didn't, I didn't want people looking at me.

805
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
You know, like, hey, what do you like?

806
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
I got this, you know, and that's all young.

807
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.000
I mean, I think I'll grow them out in some ways, but there is an absolute mental, a uniqueness of being alone in an airplane.

808
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
There is a, there's something about that.

809
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
There's something unique about that.

810
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
You know, I got a big smile in my face right now.

811
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000
So there's a, I'm not even a hundred percent sure about this, but I'm ninety nine.

812
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
This is why this is great.

813
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Every time you say single seat, every time you're like, well, it's a single seat.

814
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:40.000
There's a, there's a Ferrari sports car, which is one of the,

815
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
one of the most expensive Ferrari's that you can get.

816
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
It's nuts.

817
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
You know, it's got 10 million horsepower, and it can do the whatever.

818
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000
And it's a single seat car.

819
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000
And I, we're going to, I'm going to have to fact check this.

820
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.000
The name of the car is ego-east.

821
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
That's the name.

822
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
It's like something ego.

823
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
That's the name of the car.

824
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Totally.

825
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
I'm in this thing by myself.

826
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
There's not even anyone else to come in in here.

827
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
It's not possible.

828
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
This is all about me.

829
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Well, I think of the ego.

830
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I mean, if you want to think about even just me, think of the ego of,

831
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000
um, flying for the military, not good enough.

832
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Flying helicopters, not good enough.

833
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Flying cobras, not good enough.

834
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Flying jets, not good enough.

835
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Flying F-18s, not good enough.

836
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
Flying single seat F-18s.

837
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Okay, that'll do.

838
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Like the criteria of what I had created in my mind of what success was.

839
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Like what success was was just that.

840
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.000
And, and I don't mean to like presume that I know what you, you know, what you,

841
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
you were thinking, but hey, do you want to just be in the Navy?

842
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
That's not enough for me.

843
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Uh, you could be a diver, or like, and you could go to the military,

844
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
like, and even, and I'm, I'm implying like it's kind of crazy.

845
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Like green berate.

846
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Mmm.

847
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000
That's not what I want to do.

848
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Like, juggle.

849
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
You know, many people would kill to say their green berate, like, yeah, I know I understand it,

850
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
but that's not what I want.

851
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000
And I had created a scenario in my mind, like, if it's not a single seat,

852
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000
I lot F-18 in the Marine Corps, I'm not going to be happy, which is kind of,

853
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
it's insane.

854
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.000
It's crazy, but that is, that is what, that's what I wanted to do.

855
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
And I don't, maybe if I ended up in a two-seat garage in what I've somehow go, hey,

856
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000
you know what, I was in the Navy.

857
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
This was, this is totally awesome.

858
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
This is great.

859
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Maybe.

860
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000
But you, you know, the ego, the power of the ego going.

861
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:57.000
And that's, I think, not to defend myself too much, but I think it's a little bit different than arrogance.

862
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
The ego and the arrogance, you know, the flaunting of, I'm better than you are against,

863
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
and more like, no, that to me is the hardest, that's the highest peak you can get to.

864
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's where I want to be.

865
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And I had created it that, that's what I wanted.

866
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And other guys like, they didn't, I don't think I'll fly whatever.

867
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Uh-oh.

868
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Really?

869
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Yeah, cool, whatever, I'll fly that.

870
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Cool.

871
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So, go fly that.

872
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
If you don't have that, how far do you make it?

873
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Not where I wanted to go.

874
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I mean, okay, so there might be some small tiny, minuscule part of the population that

875
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
is just so talented that they can kind of just cruise by and they're going to get it.

876
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Right.

877
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Yeah.

878
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
There are.

879
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And there's some people that are like, guess what I'm doing this weekend.

880
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I'm sharpening my knife and polishing my boots.

881
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Yeah.

882
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Because that was me in seal training.

883
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You know, me in seal training was, oh, guys are going to go to whatever, you know,

884
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
go to the mall, go try and meet girls or whatever.

885
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I'm going to sharpen my knife the whole weekend and get ready for inspection.

886
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Because I want to make sure I get through this thing.

887
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Because I'm not sure, I see pitfalls all over the place and I don't need any more pitfalls than

888
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
or are these assistants.

889
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And you're not going to feel like you're missing out either.

890
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You're not like, man, I wish I was at the bar.

891
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You're not thinking about it all.

892
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
You're like, this is what I should be doing.

893
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
This is what I should be doing.

894
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I don't care about anything else.

895
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So you don't even feel like you're doing it even though you don't want to.

896
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You wouldn't want to do anything else.

897
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Matter of fact, if you did the other thing, you're like, you know what I should be doing

898
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
right now?

899
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I should be back home prepping.

900
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That's what I should be doing.

901
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So the, I think that's the difference.

902
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Well, maybe not the difference, but when you talk about, when you talk about ego.

903
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And you cross section some humility in there.

904
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Guess what that equals.

905
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
That equals someone that's working as hard as they possibly can and holding themselves the highest

906
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
possible standards so that they can achieve what they want to achieve.

907
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
When someone's just arrogant, guess what they don't do that extra studying.

908
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They don't stay in sharpen their knives.

909
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
They don't. And look, there's a tiny, minuscule percentage chance that they have the natural

910
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
talent. And it's probably, well, it's, I'll tell you it's a lot easier in the see it to get through

911
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
basic seal training, just based on the fact that you're really good athlete and you're

912
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
decently tough.

913
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And if you have that, you can be pretty arrogant and still make it through because you don't really

914
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
need to do anything extra because you can do a role climb and you can carry a log around

915
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and it's like, okay, you know, you played whatever. You did track and field and you played football

916
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and you, you know, you show up and you're 21 years old and you're really good shape.

917
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
You can be pretty arrogant and not really have to do anything extra and make it through the program.

918
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I bet that's a little bit more challenging. There's probably less people that would fall into that category

919
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
in pilot school because you get hit with the academics.

920
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
You get hit with the, the fine motor skills.

921
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
You get hit with the, the natural ability to, like I remember when I took the test for officer

922
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
candidate school and they're showing you pictures and what is this, is this plain, they're

923
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
showing, like, I was even going into aviation or anything. They're showing you a plane.

924
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Is this thing coming or going? Is this that?

925
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And so you're getting hit with those kind of tests as well. So there's got to be, there's,

926
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
there's different types of screening that's taking place that are more, there's a,

927
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
there's a broader modality of screening as opposed to seal training. It's like,

928
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:28.000
be cold, do pull ups. That's, that's not a huge, how much autonomy do you have over your schedule

929
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
and stuff in, in seal training as well? I'm sure some point you have zero, but do you have a bunch of free time

930
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
do you surprisingly, what surprising to a lot of people is you do have a lot.

931
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Yeah, you do have a decent amount of free time and that is part of the test.

932
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Yeah, part of the test is, oh, you want to go get drunk and get in a fight. Cool. You're not here anymore.

933
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Right. Because you just got in trouble. We don't need you in the seal teams. Oh, you did, you just went and

934
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
didn't prepare this weekend and now you're failing your third inspection. Cool. We don't need you in the

935
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
seal teams. Like, so there is a, they have to give you some opportunity. They have to give you enough

936
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
rope that you can hang yourself and you certainly can. And there's plenty of, plenty of guys that did.

937
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Yeah. Plenty of guys that got in trouble in town, didn't come back from Mexico in time for

938
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
master and, you know, you hit a couple of those things and you're, you're gone. So they give you enough

939
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000
rope if you're knucklehead, you'll hang yourself with it. But other than that, if you can do pull ups and you

940
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
can suffer, you can do it with some rope climbs, you can kind of just grit through it.

941
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And that's why I think you, that's why I think I would venture to say that we have a higher

942
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
percentage of arrogance in the seal teams because you don't, because you're not going to get

943
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000
humbled quite as much as as you are in such a selective scenario as going to flight

944
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
school. Well, going to OCS, going to the basic school, you know, getting down selected,

945
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000
down selected to get in, down selected at OCS, down selected at the basic school,

946
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
down selected at flight school. And then down selected to go to top gone. Like, that's

947
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
a bunch of very narrow, very narrow funnels that you got to get through. If you're going to

948
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000
make it all the way to top gone instructor, we don't, that's a bunch of very narrow things

949
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
to pass. Yeah, even with that, it's not a flawless system. I mean, even with that,

950
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:34.000
there are, there are, there that maybe shouldn't be there. I, I, I equate, and I'm probably

951
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
wrong about this. Just my perception, I equate the seals, being in A B seal as, as

952
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
even inside the community of these highly, highly capable special operations organizations

953
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
through the different services that the seals, I elevate them in my own mind, that

954
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
there's just something unique about that. And if I take a step back and I think, like, okay,

955
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
flying F-16s with the Air Force or flying F-18s for the Navy, then Marine Corps. Look,

956
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
man, it's the same. And there's probably people's like, greenberry and ABC, like, you could

957
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000
account a couple of that are, that's not what I had in my mind, that there was a piece

958
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
that would just set up a tiny bit compared to everything else. That's what I think,

959
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
when I think from the outside of seals, or at least can understand someone in your

960
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
shoes going, that one. And I would say when I was 18 and I was raising my right hand to

961
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and listening to the Navy, that's what I was thinking. Once I was in and I worked with the,

962
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I worked with the Marine Corps, I worked with your Army Special Forces, I worked with the

963
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
totally soldiers from the hundred and first airborne. I realized there's guys here that are

964
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000
ten times better than me. And there and there and there and a ground pounder in an infantry unit.

965
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Yeah, good. I am a humble person. I was going to ask you, so what, once you make it through

966
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Wicked after Wicked after, after Nera Wicked after Nera Wicked after Nera Wicked and now you're

967
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
to point where you're a top gun senior instructor and there's no person that can beat

968
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:05.000
you in a dogfight. How are you finding your humility at that point? For me, it was that

969
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
there actually still were people that could beat me. Got it. And I think it was almost

970
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:20.000
luck that I was able to keep being reminded of that. And what I mean by that is, no one,

971
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I will never, even if you could track it, I will never be considered the best. Even

972
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the guys at my top end of my generation, I'm in a conversation of a couple of guys, but

973
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
nobody's going to go, oh, they broke was the best guy. Nobody's going to say that I,

974
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I simply was not. Now, I was good enough to be in a strad of a couple people that

975
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
we had a small pool of of instructors that sort of fit in that little category. And I was in there.

976
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But no question that I was not at the top is there a singular person that was, or is it to,

977
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
no, it's, it's usually not, and it's, in my experience, it was like, there's a little

978
01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
group, but inside that every now and then, those guys get to fight each other. And what

979
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
almost always happened is it's, at the end, it's neutral. You come back and it was awesome,

980
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
but nobody got really the upper hand. Every now and then go, oh, dude, he was pushing me around

981
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
a little bit. So he, but it's never like he shot me or he was pushing, he bullying me.

982
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
He was like, you had like 10 degrees on me there at the end of that 20 minute fight.

983
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
So it was really super. I went out towards the later half of my career.

984
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I was the, I was the senior instructor at talk and I was the training officer as a marine.

985
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So you're talking wicked after wicked, I went out and flew with a guy named Tim Downing,

986
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
legendary Navy pilot, CEO of Top Gun, my boss at the time. And he went out.

987
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And we did four fights. First three were just how you play out neutral, neutral, neutral.

988
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I was paying really close attention. I got to the last fight and I, I did the first turn.

989
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I go, I'm going to get him. I got him. I figured him out.

990
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And it was going to be a really satisfying moment for me.

991
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And he ended up doing something. I didn't think it even be done in there.

992
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And he, he completely pummeled me. And to the point that I'm looking over from my shoulder,

993
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
almost like a brand new guy don't know what, what is happening.

994
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000
How did this happen to me? And you know, he's laughing at me on the radio.

995
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And not only went out for get it, those are the things that just the right intervals in my career.

996
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Right when I was about to go over the edge of unbeatable, I'm better than everybody.

997
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I never got to that point because something would always happen and go, and I would go, oh, damn.

998
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
That guy is better than me.

999
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Trim did that to me at a time where had had that not happened. I just didn't fight against him. There's some risk that I could have just left there and gone off the deep end and look back and go.

1000
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I was the best pal in the world, which is in a ridiculous thought.

1001
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I was lucky that every interval where I got right to the edge, something would happen to me and go, dude, that guy is better than you.

1002
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And it happened just enough. Now, that doesn't happen to a lot of people.

1003
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And, and, what do you mean that doesn't, what doesn't?

1004
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
The, the reminder, there are people that manage to get through and not have that experience happen.

1005
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And, and the irony is that there's, there's, there's more humility at top gun than you would think because it keeps happening.

1006
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
When you get stratified in an organization like top gun, that is humbling because everybody gets there for the same reason.

1007
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
You get there because you are the best.

1008
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And then you get there and then you kind of start stratifying inside that and that little tear that I was talking about that line and then the three or four.

1009
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Everybody knows who those guys are. Everybody, especially if you're not one of them.

1010
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And that, that is, that is a humbling thing in and of itself.

1011
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And if you make it up there, the only risk is if you kind of believe it like, oh, I'm here because I'm better than everyone.

1012
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:56.000
If you don't get beat at some interval, that's where you can kind of go, hey, I have done something that nobody else can, I've made it to a place that nobody else can make.

1013
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That fight against trim, you could call him right now and he would, he would know exactly what I'm talking about.

1014
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Because he also knew it from the, he had been in, this was third time on the staff as an instructor, he'd been there three times.

1015
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
He had seen it all.

1016
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
And the crazy part about that was where the first three fights are set up.

1017
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I don't think so. I really don't. I think the set up for him was the third, the second merge of the fourth fight, where I looked over and I'm like, ah, he's slow.

1018
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
He can't make this turn. He can't do this maneuver. I'm going to, I can draw it out.

1019
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I unload and I said, he doesn't have the airspeed to fly over the top. He can't do a loop in this case.

1020
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000
The difference was, as my threshold for loop airspeed, which was really low, his was lower than mine.

1021
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And that's something. Why? Because of his aircraft, because of his, because of his skill.

1022
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000
His ability to fly. So I have a, we'd have a thing called, so you could do a, like, friends and you could do a loop in a half a mile and he could do one in, it's more of a mile.

1023
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
It's more of speed, but yeah, so we had a thing called min vertical airspeed.

1024
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
We would teach guys, below 150 knots, you cannot go over the top. You can't loop your jet.

1025
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
We did that to keep people from, you know, spinning airplanes out of control.

1026
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
My min vertical airspeed was way lower than that. Like what?

1027
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
No, no, I mean, at this point, I don't, I'm, I'm good. Probably, I don't know, 115, 100.

1028
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:32.000
You can milk it up 120. And, and his, because he was a better pilot than me, he was able to fly his airplane closer to the edge of being out of control than I was.

1029
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And I did my math of, nobody can do that. I can do that.

1030
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And I got right to my, my min vertical airspeed. He was slower than me, which meant I actually had an advantage over him.

1031
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I had more speed than him, probably 10 knots over him. So these are really fine margins.

1032
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000
But that 10 knot differential didn't affect him as much as it affected me.

1033
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
So when I wound up, and I literally looked this way, thinking he'd be falling off, you have to be left.

1034
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And, and he wasn't there, and I'm like, well, where else could he be?

1035
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And he was actually inside my turn above me, and I'm, and I'm part of the thing like, you physically can't do that.

1036
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Like, you physics won't allow that.

1037
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000
The only thing that allowed us, and, and you remember Dan Petterson talking about flying the airplane beyond the facility.

1038
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I was thinking.

1039
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And, and at the end of it, the simple Twitter described it, that guy was a better pilot than I was.

1040
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
He could do something in his machine that I couldn't do the exact same machine.

1041
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And the, and the outcome was, he wins.

1042
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And not like a little advantage. It was a lopsided one sided at the end was he's directly behind me laughing at me.

1043
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:41.000
If you can't get some humility from that and go, oh, I, okay, I've made it all the way up here, and there's still someone better than me.

1044
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And thank God those things happen to me, Jocca. Like, thank God that happened to me.

1045
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Because I can keep, I take that with me, and, and I keep that, and that was a really good lesson for me.

1046
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Had that been reversed? Who knows, man?

1047
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Yeah, General Boyd, when Dan Petterson was talking about the fact that he went to the conference in General Boyd was talking,

1048
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
who is the, you know, and he's saying, look, this is what the aircraft really, we can do it.

1049
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
We can calculate more, and all the top gun guys are going, we can do things that are beyond that.

1050
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
That's right. And what that reminds me of is that you'll be doing Gigi into someone.

1051
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And now have some capability that's not normal.

1052
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
The two capabilities that might not be normal, one is flexibility.

1053
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Someone that's massively flexible, and you get past their guard, and you think you're past their guard, and there's no human that's going to be able to take the leg and put it back in front of you.

1054
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And yet they do it, or someone that's just psychoshrong, and you get across side on them, and they kind of bridge and get a position with their hands, and you're going, what are you going to do? Push me off of them.

1055
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And that's pretty freaking crazy, but it's a similar thing that there's no possible way you think.

1056
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
There's no human that's going to put their leg in front of me right now.

1057
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Jeff Glover. Jeff Glover like your past is guarding, and there's a leg coming over your side, and you're thinking,

1058
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Yeah. Who is there someone else on the map with us right now?

1059
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Because a human can't do this. Well, he's doing it right now, and he's got your back.

1060
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And the other thing I was thinking about was I was on my first deployment to Iraq, and we were doing a bunch of ops and it looked.

1061
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:20.000
At this point, I was very lucky because there wasn't a lot of people that we were the only platoon.

1062
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And I rack it this time. For a short period of time, I had the only platoon in Iraq, and we were tossed up with some people, but I had the own, imagine that.

1063
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I'm imagining that. All the seals I have the only platoon in Iraq.

1064
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So it's freaking awesome. And I remember, and then eventually, you know, now the other platoon started coming in when my other platoon started coming in, my commanding officer came in.

1065
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And we had a really good relationship, guide work from before, and we had done a series of operations, rapid operations, really tight turn times, and got the targets we were going after.

1066
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And I remember, my commanding officer gave me some incredibly strong compliment.

1067
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:16.000
You know, like, I mean, now it sounds completely ridiculous. At the time, it was this, you know, really strong compliment about what incredible, you know, ground breaking and all this stuff.

1068
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And I looked at it, remember, I looked at it, and I said, hey, sir, give me 24 hours, and I'll screw it up.

1069
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Because, and the reason I said that is because I don't only saw operations, you're like, man, so many things can go wrong. Bad things can happen.

1070
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And I don't even, you know, and we had already had some bad things happen. You know, we'd already had some mistakes. We had already had some things that should have gone different.

1071
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:52.000
And maybe they didn't quite leak out to, you know, maybe we kept them inside the platoon, like, hey, dude, what were you doing? Why were you over there? If we would have, you know, if we didn't deconstruct it that moment, you could have got shot like, like, some things where we got away with it, right?

1072
01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And I got away with some mistakes. And so he's telling me what a great job, and I just looked at him as he gave us 24 hours and I'll screw it up. And, and that to me is something I always tell myself, you know,

1073
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:13.000
there always have that always have that, that person whispering in your ear telling you that all glory is fleeting because it is.

1074
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I think that lesson is, it's impossible to say how important that is. And you probably know this, but every single day at work at echelon front, no matter what good work we've done, no matter what impact made, no matter what the client tells me, how great echelon front is, every single new phone call, every single, every time I do the same thing I've done 100 times, I think about that.

1075
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And that event I was talking about in the earplane, that's why I think like that. And I think like that every single time, every single day, I'm about to start off a keynote that I've done 100 times or 400 times.

1076
01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And I think, you don't want to screw this up, you got to get this right. You can undo all the work that you've done by not having this be as good as every other one that you do.

1077
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So there's so much value in that recognition. And for me, being reminded that at my best, there's still somebody better, that I keep with me every single day, every day and everything that I do. So losing is sometimes a good thing.

1078
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.000
We're about to jump into the next section before I went down that tangent education. And by the way, we're on page six now out of this chapter, we're moving right along.

1079
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Professional military education from Marines Intensity Develop Creative Thinking Leaders in a continuous progressive process of development.

1080
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Those are some words that people do not think of when they think of the United States Marine Corps or the military at large, creative thinking leaders in a continuous progressive process of development.

1081
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000
This philosophy aligns well with the kind of education Marines need to succeed in competition as well as in war.

1082
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:14.000
While the nature of competition endures over extended periods, like war, its character constantly evolves.

1083
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Rivals continually strive to improve their competitive advantages, strive to gain the initiative, and strive to keep their competitors off balance.

1084
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:39.000
If you wake up in the morning and you just read that line to yourself, that your rivals are continually striving to improve their competitive advantages, they're striving to gain the initiative, and they're striving to keep you off of balance, that's a good thing to wake up to in the morning.

1085
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Because it's really easy to forget that.

1086
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Education is a primary method for Marines to sustain competitive advantage over time.

1087
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I'm going to say that again, what's the primary method? Is it marksmanship? Is it battle exercises? No, they're saying education.

1088
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Now, it's a primary, but a lot of people don't think that that even falls in the top 10 for the Marine Corps education.

1089
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:20.000
As Marine leaders progress through their careers, they need to develop mastery of the concepts that provide an ability to lead organizations like the Marine Corps through cycles of innovation.

1090
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Cycles of innovation that are essential to staying at the forefront of competition.

1091
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:36.000
These concepts go beyond just adaptation. They go beyond just, look, if you're just adapting to what's happening, you're wrong.

1092
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
If I'm just adapting to what you're doing, Dave, I'm wrong. I'm wrong. I need to be making you adapt to what I'm doing. I'm going to be on offense.

1093
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
They include topics like organizational learning, the ability for an organization to sense changes in its environment.

1094
01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Not react to changes in its mind, but sense those changes. You know, lately I've been talking a lot about, but just being more aware of what's happening when people ask me, well, the home life balance.

1095
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:17.000
You know how much I'm supposed to say, hey, the answer is you need to balance them. How can I help you? I can help you by making sure that you're more aware and you're more attuned to when things get off balance. You need to sense those things more.

1096
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And you need to sense changes in the environment and approve. It's effectiveness and efficiency in response to those changes change management when leaders are able to implement needed change in an organization while keeping its people engaged.

1097
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And the difference between sustaining and disruptive innovation, which is essentially a difference between incremental improvements of what already exists versus new and better approaches that displaced the old methods over time.

1098
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:55.000
That's what we're trying to do. It is not enough for Marines to educate themselves on war and war fighting alone. Such a narrow focus limits the benefit they can give to the nation.

1099
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Most of our Marines career will be spent training in the fleet marine force or serving in a support establishment, understanding competition and how the Marine Corps contributes to it is an essential skill, especially for career Marines who will have the greatest impact on the Marine Corps competitive attributes over time.

1100
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Self-education in social, economic, technological and other matters beyond military history and leadership are essential if Marines are to excel in competition.

1101
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Now, what's really cool about working at National Humphrum and working with all these different companies is we get to work in economic environments.

1102
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:59.000
We get to work in technological environments, we get to work in construction and manufacturing to work in all these different environments. And what's awesome is when we can take what we know and we can overlay it into those things and get to see and get to learn how our principles impact even in these this wide array of different environments.

1103
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And that actually makes us smarter because when I see how a principle, when I see how cover move applies in a manufacturing plant and I see how it works in a financial company and I see how it works in a sales organization.

1104
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:26.000
When I see all those things, guess what I know better, I know cover and move better, I understand it better.

1105
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And that's what they're talking about here. The better you understand all these different aspects of what's going on in the competition between America and other nation states, the better you can see how your, how your organization contributes to that competition and how you can better contribute to that competition.

1106
01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The goal for education then is to foster awareness with the campaigning mindset of how all capabilities available to Marines can fit into and support a larger competition strategy.

1107
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It should improve knowledge of openness to the interests of potential and existing allies and partners. The outcome we seek from education is to increase the ability of Marines to envision greater possibilities and competition.

1108
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Next section talent management our doxion of maneuver warfare places a premium on individual judgment and action.

1109
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Wait a second, we talk about the Marine Corps is never just fallen orders. No, we place a premium on individual judgment and action, which also means we recognize all Marines of a given grade and occupational specialty are not interchangeable.

1110
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:55.000
They should be assigned to billet based on specific ability and temperament. This expression of talent management found in war fighting applies equally as well to competing. People have different strengths and weaknesses.

1111
01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000
The organizations that compete most effectively place their people in position to use their strengths.

1112
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Now, this is something we get asked to quite a bit and you know what I wrote about leadership strategy and tactics. Hey, if I've got if Dave is really good at at at sales and he's not that great at administrative duties.

1113
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
What should I do with it?

1114
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Well, I'll tell you what you put him in sales. That's when he's good at let him go do it now does that mean you let him just ignore the administrative part and he never has to touch paperwork and we hire some it. No, no, no, no, we want to strengthen his weaknesses, but we want to utilize and capitalize on his strengths.

1115
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:50.000
We also coach their people on the development of their strengths and link their use to the organizations goals. Some people excel at planning and creating new designs for operations and organizations others excel at taking a blueprint and then optimizing it so it works as well as possible.

1116
01:25:50.000 --> 01:26:04.000
If you have the ability to do all these things with equal skill to compete at peak effectiveness, marine leaders need to measure the talents of the people they lead and then match these skills to the duties they perform organizations that do this well and for a sustained period.

1117
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Also have a sustained competitive advantage they maximize the performance of their people over time.

1118
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:22.000
That answers a lot of questions if you're in a leadership position. You find someone that's good at something let him do it.

1119
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Force planning.

1120
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Force planning which includes the functions of design development and management of the force for the Marine Corps must balance utility at many points on the competition continuum with building a force that is a functional tool for the joint force to use in winning battles.

1121
01:26:39.000 --> 01:27:08.000
The output of this complex undertaking must serve the needs of competing generally and of war fighting in particular realizing that they both exist on the same continuum and that they are interrelated shapes shapes are overall approach to this planning. So we could take the Marine Corps and if we only wanted them to be good at war fighting, we would do things differently.

1122
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:18.000
We would change entire, entire portions of the way we raise Marines.

1123
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
We would get rid of certain parts of the table.

1124
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
What are you talking about?

1125
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
We need to know marksmanship, we need to cover moving.

1126
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
That's what we need to do.

1127
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
We need to be awesome at our tactics.

1128
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
We need to know how to win.

1129
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
We know how to interact with each other.

1130
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Catch people in the combined arms and level. That's what we're going to focus on.

1131
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
There's a whole other bunch of stuff that we focus on.

1132
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Well, that the Marine Corps focuses on.

1133
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And what they're saying here is you have to find that balance.

1134
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You've got to be able to compete, which means we've got to be able to go out and shake hands and make friends and build relationships.

1135
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And we've got to be able to fight.

1136
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
We've got to find out we've got to balance those two and we've got to realize that they're both interrelated.

1137
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:07.000
So this happens with companies where companies, hey, we've got to make money.

1138
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
We've got to make money. That's great. Guess what else we have to do?

1139
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
We have to maintain our reputation.

1140
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Because we can make a ton of money and blow our reputation out the door.

1141
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Or we can have a great reputation and now we're going bankrupt.

1142
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
So what do we need to do?

1143
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
We need to find balance on these two things.

1144
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:35.000
To do this successfully, the output of our force planning should present a dilemma to our potential competitors and defeat their plans against us.

1145
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:42.000
The way we combine our organization, the way we combine our organization, doctrine training and equipment should produce a competitive advantage or multiple advantages.

1146
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000
The options we choose within each of these elements affects our competitiveness over time.

1147
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.000
For example, if we enhance the training for equipment mechanics so that they can operate for extended periods without external support,

1148
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
then we also enhance our ability to operate in austere environments for a long period of time.

1149
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.000
The output of force planning is the sum of choices made inside each of these elements.

1150
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:23.000
These choices must be guided by the goal of establishing competitive advantages, which are useful for combat, and also useful for competition.

1151
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Having that goal, when you make sure that you're sticking with your goal, you have to be guided.

1152
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Your choices are guided by the goal of establishing these competitive advantages.

1153
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
That's what you're making our choices based on.

1154
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Is this going to give us a competitive advantage or not?

1155
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
That's a very good way of simplifying your decision making process.

1156
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
How is this going to give us a competitive advantage?

1157
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
If it's not, why are we doing it?

1158
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000
That competitive advantage is something you have to have to be successful, and when you're making the connection to business,

1159
01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:01.000
especially when you're just looking at the most basic level of what consumers want.

1160
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
They've got a bunch of options.

1161
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.000
They can get the product of the thing you make usually from a whole bunch of different companies.

1162
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.000
The competitive advantage is how you can deliver it to what they want better than everybody else.

1163
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
If what you're doing isn't contributing to that, that I think over time,

1164
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000
we've talked about complacency, the other things, the inability to recognize that you have to continue to contribute to that competitive advantage.

1165
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
That doesn't stay.

1166
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
If you have that competitive advantage, now your competitors aren't trying to erode that and take that away from you.

1167
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Even the idea that everything you're doing has to be designed to contribute to either building or sustaining that advantage.

1168
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Or you're going to go away.

1169
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
You will be out maneuvered by your competition.

1170
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I love that even in the Marine Corps they're saying it's useful for combat and competition.

1171
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Those are two different things and we're telling the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps telling Marines.

1172
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Those are two different things.

1173
01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Which is interesting because they're also saying throughout this entire book that those are on the same continuum.

1174
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So I'm going to do something that's going to be useful at multiple locations on that continuum.

1175
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Because if all we cared about is you being good at combat, we would raise Marines just like you said in a totally different way.

1176
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And we would forgive a whole bunch of things that happen like that's okay.

1177
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
He can do all those crazy things because when we go to war, we're going to unleash that guy.

1178
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And we know that's not enough.

1179
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
You can't do that for a whole bunch of different reasons.

1180
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And the recognition that hey combat is combat is going to happen.

1181
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I mean, certainly in this image, you're going to see some combat.

1182
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
But that might be fleeting.

1183
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000
You might get one opportunity, a one good deployment, but the competition piece and they've said it over.

1184
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
That is happening all the time.

1185
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
It'll hold a bunch of different ways.

1186
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Continuing on, if we are to fully prepare, then Marines need to also consider the merits and challenges of asymmetry in competition.

1187
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Truly asymmetric asymmetric competition actions or competitive actions can impose costs on the rival.

1188
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:16.000
For example, the original assault breaker concept developed in the 1970s and 1980s was an asymmetric response to the Soviet advantage in armor and number.

1189
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:23.000
So in Europe in the 70s, they had this massive, the the the Soviet block had more armor than we did.

1190
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And if they attacked it was their armor versus NATO armor, we they had the numbers.

1191
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So they came up with this this plan, which was, hey, as soon as something breaks out.

1192
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:46.000
We're going to attack deep behind enemy lines with long range weapons missiles to to take out all those extra tanks that they have.

1193
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.000
So that was that was something that we that we came up with to to negate their competitive advantage.

1194
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
That that will here.

1195
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000
It says improved sensors with precision munitions to negate the Soviet advantages.

1196
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
So I guess I could have just read it.

1197
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:21.000
The execution of force planning starts a cycle that begins putting forth the theory about how we can contribute to the nation strategic competitions throughout the continuum building capabilities to bring theory to reality and then testing the capabilities to exercises and operations.

1198
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
So again, now they've gone from guessing.

1199
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Well, I'm going from guessing to hypothesis now it's putting forth the theory right my theory is because that's another word for guess it's another nice word for I'm going to take a guess my theory is.

1200
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And then you take those and you take those theories and you put them to the test just like a hypothesis in exercises and operations.

1201
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Let's see how they work.

1202
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Other political actors observe this theory unfold and adapt themselves so they can compete more effectively against it.

1203
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
That's what's going to happen.

1204
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Our observations of these adaptations starts the cycle once again.

1205
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Force planning then is a continual effort to stay ahead of potential adversaries.

1206
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Thus we see that force planning itself is a competitive act and the Marine Corps must retain the ability to reconfigure the force when necessary to sustain its competitive advantage or develop new ones.

1207
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:25.000
This ability starts with the mental flexibility that comes from humility and the disciplined practice of questioning assumptions.

1208
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Tattoo that on your forehead.

1209
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Well, maybe on your forearm so you can see it.

1210
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
We don't want to have to look in the mirror.

1211
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:42.000
This ability that we should be constantly checking and seeing where we're at and seeing what adaptations the enemy is making.

1212
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.000
The competitors are making and if we don't have mental flexibility.

1213
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
We're wrong and if we don't have humility we're wrong and if we don't have discipline we're wrong.

1214
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I think these people listen to the podcast.

1215
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
That's what I'm thinking.

1216
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I'm thinking that the authors listen to the podcast.

1217
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Let us know.

1218
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Our awareness of the competition continuum and its existence both above and below the threshold of violence.

1219
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Brawls are view on force planning.

1220
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
So the better you understand that.

1221
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.000
The better you understand that the the game is much bigger than hey we're going to fight you.

1222
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
With violence the game is much bigger than that.

1223
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Our philosophy is that we can as we have done in the past prepare Marines to succeed in competition without sacrificing the Marine Corps's ability to prevail in battle.

1224
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Our understanding of ourselves must include how the Marine Corps fits into the complex adaptive system that is the naval service and the joint force.

1225
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000
We know that the Marine Corps is operated on both sides of the violence threshold and expect this to continue into the future.

1226
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.000
However, our campaigning mindset should lead us to explore thoroughly how the Marine Corps can contribute to preventing war.

1227
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
We can look at a little cyops.

1228
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:09.000
How the Marine Corps contributes to preventing war by regularly operating below the violence threshold even as Marines are ready to operate above it when required.

1229
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I had some had a note here and I don't even know what it meant.

1230
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.000
When I talked about preparing the Marine's to succeed in competition without sacrificing the Marine Corps's ability to prevail in battle.

1231
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I have in parentheses harder than you think.

1232
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Oh and then I have as an example I have college sports teams.

1233
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Okay, so now it makes sense.

1234
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
The example I thought of as if you've got a college sports team.

1235
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000
If the simple example would be hey if the only thing we want these athletes to do is play football.

1236
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Everything's out of the table.

1237
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Well, it gives you a lot of capability on the football field, but let's face it.

1238
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
No one has anything other than football when they're done.

1239
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
So you have to balance it.

1240
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
It's an example of echo Charles.

1241
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Hey, he's not doing well in geometry class.

1242
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
He's got a D. We need to bench him.

1243
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Well, what if he's our best player?

1244
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000
We don't want to bench him, but we have to balance it.

1245
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Now on to the conclusion.

1246
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:29.000
The Marine Corps is one of the nation's tools for the strategic competition that is the normal state of events in international relations.

1247
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And by the way, man.

1248
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:41.000
As you watch the news, as you read the news, which I recommend.

1249
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:49.000
If you think about the international news and you pay attention to the competitions that are going on,

1250
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
it all this makes a lot more sense when you see what China's doing.

1251
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
When you see what I ran's doing.

1252
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000
When you see what's going on in Syria, when you see what's going on in the Middle East, when you see what's going on in Europe,

1253
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:10.000
when you see what you start to think about all those things from a more holistic viewpoint and you overlay the fact that it's one big competition which looks.

1254
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000
That's the way it is. Look at what Russia does.

1255
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Look at what Russia does.

1256
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000
See, they are competing.

1257
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
They are competing.

1258
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And not only that, sometimes echo Charles, people around Russia, like people other than Russia, they're out playing flag football.

1259
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And Russia is playing tackle.

1260
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
You know what I'm saying?

1261
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:51.000
There, someone else is playing Tai Chi, and they're playing combat sombo.

1262
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And the Tai Chi people are thinking like, oh, you know, and also they get punched in the face.

1263
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Or they're in a bad position.

1264
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
More worse, they're in a bad position. They don't even know it.

1265
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
They don't know the capability that that sombo practitioner has.

1266
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000
So you've got to pay attention that. You've got to start singing that these little maneuvers, these little maneuvers that these other nation states make. They're not.

1267
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I can't even believe I'm having to say this right now.

1268
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
But you can watch things happen.

1269
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And the way people respond to it, it's almost as if it's just by chance that this other nation state is making this maneuver.

1270
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
And throughout this book, and I wish I would have, should have been doing this all along,

1271
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
you can find examples of where this is happening.

1272
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Oh, there's a boundary getting stretched. Oh, there's a salami slice.

1273
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Like all these things are going on. Oh, there's a, there's a below the violence threshold maneuver.

1274
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And they're going to back off right before there's a response coming. This is what's happening all the time.

1275
01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:00.000
There's a competition piece inside that too that I think about is, we were talking earlier about hierarchy.

1276
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Everybody kind of knows the hierarchy too. Everybody kind of knows where we are in the hierarchy.

1277
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And what, what that should tell us is that they know, which is even more reason for them to be competing all the time,

1278
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
because they know where they sit and they don't like being there.

1279
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
They don't like being there. And that is true for nation states.

1280
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And that shop that you're running on that street corner. If the hierarchy is known, which it almost always is,

1281
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000
the other people in the hierarchy that are underneath you don't like that.

1282
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000
They also know that they can't go toe to toe with you. They can't do the brute force method and just run you out.

1283
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000
So they got out maneuvering you and how compete you with little tiny moves here and there.

1284
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And when you were talking about the idea of, I can't believe I have to say this is the complacent that comes from being at the top of your food chain,

1285
01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.000
your food chain, whatever it is, everybody else knows it's going on. And they're all trying to out maneuver you.

1286
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
So you shouldn't be surprised by any of it. That's what they're doing. You were saying earlier,

1287
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
you're out on the weekends going to the club. They're home, sharpening their knives.

1288
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
And that's what they're supposed to be doing.

1289
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And actually, sometimes they're not even sharpening their knives.

1290
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:24.000
What they're doing is they've got a bar out in town that they're working with.

1291
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
That's giving free drinks for you.

1292
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000
And so even though they can only sharpen their knife so much, so what are they going to do? They're going to weaken you.

1293
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
You got to be on the watch for that.

1294
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
You've ever seen the movie training day?

1295
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Yes.

1296
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Excellent film, by the way.

1297
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000
That's what that whole movie was about, essentially.

1298
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000
So he was trying to, you know, he basically had this new recruit who do anything he wanted to make the team or whatever.

1299
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So we set him up to have to do everything yet, like he asked him to do.

1300
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
It started with making a smoke that we eat or whatever.

1301
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
If you are some movie, you'll understand.

1302
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And even says in one of the pivotal parts, when he's manipulating him, he says, hey, it's chess.

1303
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
It's not checkers.

1304
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000
So like, yeah, if you don't know you're in a competition or whatever, essentially the explanation.

1305
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Where you're just like, oh, yeah, today we're just sort of cruising, where, and actually you're example of like, okay, if you know where you are in the hierarchy,

1306
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000
or hierarchy, and you're, let's say you're high, and you have all these challenges, people or entities, right?

1307
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000
You're kind of cruising, and they know they can't go to the tooth you without you, how you put it.

1308
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:46.000
But their move can be like 10 years down the road, and they're plotting for that 10 years, they're plotting for that move, or that series of moves, you know.

1309
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
So we got Denzel plays the bad cop essentially.

1310
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Yeah, Lanzo.

1311
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Who plays the other one?

1312
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Jake is played by Ethan Hawke.

1313
01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Okay, so, and that's the first escalation is smoke and pot.

1314
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Oh, the first escalation starts in the beginning, so like right, the way he talks to him in the beginning, where you could tell this guy, Jake is like, he just wants to make the team, he wants to do everything.

1315
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
So it starts without eating.

1316
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
By the way, is that whole movie take place in one day?

1317
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Yeah, or is that just the name of it?

1318
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Oh, that's all one day.

1319
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

1320
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Because I was going to say what's interesting about that is, if Ethan Hawke, Jake, wait, Jake, wait, hey, hey, hey.

1321
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:35.000
If he would have gotten a brief prior to that day starting, that there was a competition happening, and there was maneuvers that were about to be made.

1322
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Yeah.

1323
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000
He wouldn't have, you know, if he knows that this guy is maneuvering, it's like, hey, you need to smoke this week.

1324
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.000
No, no, that's not happening because to me, once he got him to do that, and I don't know, I don't remember the movie, that's almost checkmate, right?

1325
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:56.000
That's almost checkmate, like, hey, dude, well, I'll get you, you need to get pissed tested, and now you're out of the force, and now you're in trouble,

1326
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:08.000
now you got a bad reputation, or, not even a bad reputation, you got a, what's, what's an RE4 code in the military where you're not allowed to get a federal job anymore, but you got a bad thing happening, you got a dishonorable discharge.

1327
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
That's a checkmate move, almost out of the gate.

1328
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
It's literally how it played out because that was like one of the first major moves.

1329
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And it didn't come into play until later when he was like, hey, kill that guy.

1330
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.000
But if he, if he would have been aware of the competition that was happening,

1331
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:34.000
he would have known, hey man, this is not a good move, hey, I'm not doing that, and that's totally, actually would have flipped, almost flipped the checkmate.

1332
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Oh, deal, the whole deal is flipped, but you're not aware of it, you get a lower than, well, maybe, I mean, obviously it was a movie, so,

1333
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.000
there was, he always had it, you ever put out that qualifier before, no, you just treat movies like that reality.

1334
01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:00.000
He did in there, I mean, you're right, obviously, but in that particular movie, he had him by the, he had him by the ball's the whole time,

1335
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:08.000
because Jay Quate went into a thing, he wants to make the team, he's even, he's even beyond not knowing that he's competing.

1336
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:19.000
He's in like the, he's in the, beyond opposite direction where he's thinking that he wants to like prove and be, be a part of the team, you know,

1337
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:28.000
the opposite of competing, exact opposite, and it's funny you say that two words like, oh, that was checkmate, where he was like,

1338
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
one that came up when he's like, hey, kill the guy, he's like, not gonna do it, he's like, in fact, you know what, I'm tired of this whole thing,

1339
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I'm turning you guys in, he's like, yeah, go ahead, but what's gonna happen when they pull your blood, you've been smoking weed and math all day or not math, it was like PCP or whatever,

1340
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
all day having you and he's like looking at him, you can see the wheel, you're getting a smoke PCP or is it like intertwined in the pot?

1341
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Yeah, exactly right. So it was weed, so he made them smoke the weed and then after he smoked it he was like, dang, I didn't know you smoke BCP, he's like, you did, I haven't, but you have now, you know,

1342
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
like that kind of like, like, did Denzel's character smoke weed as well?

1343
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.000
No, he made him, he put a gun to it. Yeah, he was like, hey, and the way he crashed, have he seen somebody do?

1344
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.000
The way he rationalized it was like, hey, if you refuse weed in an undercover situation, they're just gonna kill you.

1345
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.000
So you gotta be ready to do this kind of stuff. And he's like, oh no, he's like, I don't want you on my team.

1346
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Gun do is out on my team, you know, we put that gun. Do is head? Yeah, just as like a, like a demonstration.

1347
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Well, like what if it was like this? Exactly right. If we were on the street, you'd be dead right now, like that kind of stuff, you know?

1348
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000
So it's kind of like, he learned, it's almost like he'd Jake felt like he was learning this big, huge impactful lesson at that time, you know?

1349
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Where he's like, yeah, you gotta kind of, get to push it far sometimes, you know, to throw them out.

1350
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Yeah, kind of. Or did he brow beat him? He brow beat him, kind of both.

1351
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
He actually, the whole movie is him doing one or the other, is weird.

1352
01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.000
It's a weird, it's a weird, a mini-pulation thing. Yeah, and finally when he was tired of it, he was like, I'm not doing this. He was like, oh yeah, but you've been smoking PCP all day.

1353
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:08.000
So you kind of got a, and all my guys were in on it, they're all gonna say the same thing and he's like, and he kind of has to do it.

1354
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Then soon, like right after he's like, hey, I know it's crazy, I know, but this how it is, you know, we gotta be wolf.

1355
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Wait, does that come up?

1356
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Sparrow there, doesn't come up? No.

1357
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Uh, since we're talking about training day, I have a small request, you may or may not comply, but let's face it.

1358
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000
When you give me the, okay, it sounds a lot like the Zell Washington, that's here.

1359
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I'm not gonna do it, but that's exactly where I got it from. No, I know that, because even though I don't know that movie very well,

1360
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Yeah, there was a little, if I get a little overly hostile with you, kind of one of your defensive mechanisms is to throw that.

1361
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Okay, back at me.

1362
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
They broke there was a tear it.

1363
01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:02.000
There was a time in training day, in the beginning, he meets a metadiner, and he's like, oh, the guy Jake, he's trying to make small talk, you know, it's awkward and a lot of,

1364
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000
a lot of, he's reading the newspaper, and he's like, not talking to him, it's awkward.

1365
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
So Jake keeps trying to make small talk, he's like, hey, shut up, let me read my paper.

1366
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Jake's like, oh, awkward.

1367
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So he can't help himself. He has to say something again, just to fight the awkwardness, and then he's like, put it down the paper. He's like, hey, tell me a story.

1368
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:29.000
He's like, what are you talking about? He's like, but you want, I read the newspaper for the stories or blah, blah, blah, he says it's like, so you gotta tell me a story.

1369
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:36.000
So they start telling the story and then, in the part when he's like, oh, yeah, I'm with this, my training officer, she was a girl or whatever.

1370
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:44.000
He's like, oh, it's a girl training officer. Oh, man, that's, he's like, yeah, he's like, oh, right, all right, all right, all right.

1371
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
So that's where it came from.

1372
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Audit, you use it in different contexts, but yes, got it from. Thank you.

1373
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Talk for that.

1374
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:58.000
It always makes me smile. If I can push you to the point where you throw that at me, I know I did my job for the day.

1375
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:13.000
The, the manipulation, you gotta be on the lookout for it. You gotta be on the lookout because if you're not competing all the time, if you don't recognize that you're competing, that's when you're going to get caught.

1376
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:21.000
And you should never, never, ever give that kind of leverage to another human being. Over you.

1377
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Not to go back to training day too much, but there's, there's smoking. We part when he realized it when he was like, hey, it's fucking busy.

1378
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000
He all day, haven't you? And he's like, he looked at me, he's like, you've been planning this all day. There he goes. I've been planning it all week.

1379
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:44.000
So you'm saying, no, that's the demonstration. Hey, you're always competing last week. We didn't even meet each other. I was already out still competing.

1380
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I didn't look at you now. I'd lessen their everywhere. I kind of forgot about that. I'm just retracing myself to the last four years and trying to make sure I know what's actually going on here.

1381
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.88
to the book for the conclusion as professionals

1382
01:50:00.88 --> 01:50:03.24
Marines acknowledge this condition and prepare themselves

1383
01:50:03.24 --> 01:50:05.64
and the Marine Corps to succeed in this struggle.

1384
01:50:05.64 --> 01:50:08.40
Adopting a campaigning mindset helps us do this

1385
01:50:08.40 --> 01:50:12.36
effectively as it aids us in visualizing the long timelines

1386
01:50:12.36 --> 01:50:15.12
that often span years and decades.

1387
01:50:18.04 --> 01:50:21.04
This influences the type of education they say.

1388
01:50:21.04 --> 01:50:26.04
I mean, it's so crazy to not think about years and decades.

1389
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:31.04
That's if you're not thinking in years and decades,

1390
01:50:31.04 --> 01:50:33.04
you're going to have some issues.

1391
01:50:33.04 --> 01:50:36.60
Yeah, I'm proud of not a thinking years and

1392
01:50:36.60 --> 01:50:37.84
I mean, whatever.

1393
01:50:37.84 --> 01:50:40.64
Typically, we don't think in years and decades.

1394
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:43.64
Typically, I mean, we're for a handful of things, but that's it.

1395
01:50:45.64 --> 01:50:47.64
And those handful things, what I'm talking about.

1396
01:50:47.64 --> 01:50:48.84
Yeah, this is important.

1397
01:50:48.84 --> 01:50:51.84
This influences the type of education they seek to prepare them

1398
01:50:51.84 --> 01:50:54.88
for the continual innovation that will be required to sustain

1399
01:50:54.88 --> 01:50:57.24
competitive advantage and create new ones over the course

1400
01:50:57.24 --> 01:50:58.12
of long-term campaign.

1401
01:50:58.12 --> 01:50:59.84
It also influences their decision.

1402
01:50:59.84 --> 01:51:02.20
They're thinking on talent management because the most

1403
01:51:02.20 --> 01:51:04.68
competitive organizations are the ones that get the most

1404
01:51:04.68 --> 01:51:07.28
from their people by placing them in positions to use their

1405
01:51:07.28 --> 01:51:08.76
strengths on a regular basis.

1406
01:51:08.76 --> 01:51:11.80
All of this preparation leads to the type of agile force

1407
01:51:11.80 --> 01:51:15.92
planning needed in long-term competition, resulting in a succession,

1408
01:51:15.92 --> 01:51:20.48
a succession of force planning that outcomes,

1409
01:51:20.48 --> 01:51:23.60
planning outcomes that achieve and then sustain competitive

1410
01:51:23.60 --> 01:51:26.60
advantage advantages in the military element of national power.

1411
01:51:26.60 --> 01:51:32.48
That's the conclusion there of chapter three, almost two hours

1412
01:51:32.48 --> 01:51:32.84
deep.

1413
01:51:32.84 --> 01:51:38.28
So a good place to stop for now, because I don't even want to crack

1414
01:51:38.28 --> 01:51:44.72
open chapter four yet too much for one night.

1415
01:51:44.72 --> 01:51:48.76
So we're always in competition.

1416
01:51:48.76 --> 01:51:51.96
We should be in strategic competition.

1417
01:51:51.96 --> 01:51:56.60
And all of this chapter three, we are preparing for competition.

1418
01:51:56.60 --> 01:51:58.96
Echo Charles.

1419
01:51:58.96 --> 01:52:00.12
Here comes the tee up.

1420
01:52:00.12 --> 01:52:01.84
Here comes the softball coming your way.

1421
01:52:01.84 --> 01:52:03.80
Let's see if you can knock it out of the park.

1422
01:52:03.80 --> 01:52:06.000
In speaking of preparing for competitions,

1423
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.24
do you have any suggestions that will help us stay prepared?

1424
01:52:09.24 --> 01:52:10.48
Yeah, it takes up limits.

1425
01:52:10.48 --> 01:52:13.12
And here's why straight to it.

1426
01:52:13.12 --> 01:52:14.56
Yep, here's why.

1427
01:52:14.56 --> 01:52:17.52
So you know, okay, so we'll start with the joint stuff as we always

1428
01:52:17.52 --> 01:52:18.36
do this as way.

1429
01:52:18.36 --> 01:52:20.60
So a lot of times, I'm one of these people,

1430
01:52:20.60 --> 01:52:23.80
but I don't have joint problems, right?

1431
01:52:23.80 --> 01:52:25.80
Until you do, seems saying.

1432
01:52:25.80 --> 01:52:28.20
So that time, if we're not thinking that,

1433
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:30.92
that if we're not considering the fact that we might have

1434
01:52:30.92 --> 01:52:32.64
these issues with joints, we're lifting weights,

1435
01:52:32.64 --> 01:52:34.72
we're doing the jujuts.

1436
01:52:34.72 --> 01:52:37.40
And we're not anticipating the potential for joint problems.

1437
01:52:37.40 --> 01:52:40.28
We're not going to be competing in that way,

1438
01:52:40.28 --> 01:52:42.28
or aware of that competition.

1439
01:52:42.28 --> 01:52:43.60
Okay.

1440
01:52:43.60 --> 01:52:46.48
We also need to be strategic in the way that we're thinking.

1441
01:52:46.48 --> 01:52:48.04
Because we are putting a wear and tear,

1442
01:52:48.04 --> 01:52:50.20
it might not hurt you right now,

1443
01:52:50.20 --> 01:52:53.64
but guess what you're doing in two years, three years, five years.

1444
01:52:53.64 --> 01:52:57.32
You want to keep those things maintained in the Navy,

1445
01:52:57.32 --> 01:52:58.80
in the Marine Corps that we know about.

1446
01:52:58.80 --> 01:53:00.28
I'm sure it's this way in the Army near for us.

1447
01:53:00.28 --> 01:53:03.36
Well, you're going to follow these maintenance protocols.

1448
01:53:04.56 --> 01:53:07.44
And they're going to help when you need that element,

1449
01:53:07.44 --> 01:53:08.72
when you need that piece of equipment,

1450
01:53:08.72 --> 01:53:11.88
when you need that shoulder, that elbow, that knee.

1451
01:53:13.08 --> 01:53:15.40
And look, you need, let's face it.

1452
01:53:15.40 --> 01:53:18.04
It could already come with a kind of genetic disadvantage.

1453
01:53:18.04 --> 01:53:20.64
You might have knees that are skinny.

1454
01:53:20.64 --> 01:53:24.92
They need all the help they can get.

1455
01:53:24.92 --> 01:53:25.76
Oh, yeah.

1456
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:28.04
And if that's the case.

1457
01:53:28.04 --> 01:53:29.72
Hey, you get these supplements.

1458
01:53:29.72 --> 01:53:33.76
Listen, we are doing something at Jockel Fuel

1459
01:53:33.76 --> 01:53:37.72
to try and help out.

1460
01:53:37.72 --> 01:53:40.36
So what we're doing is if you,

1461
01:53:40.36 --> 01:53:43.76
we know that shipping is expensive,

1462
01:53:43.76 --> 01:53:48.000
we know that people are already paying for the product.

1463
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.80
And now, this and they got to pay for shipping, too.

1464
01:53:50.80 --> 01:53:53.84
And what we want to do is we want to give you a way

1465
01:53:53.84 --> 01:53:56.000
to get that shipping cost down.

1466
01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.20
What we got to get it down.

1467
01:53:57.20 --> 01:53:58.80
We got to get it down a lot.

1468
01:53:58.80 --> 01:54:00.80
We got to make it free.

1469
01:54:00.80 --> 01:54:03.68
If you subscribe to any of these items,

1470
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:06.32
if you subscribe to any of these items,

1471
01:54:06.32 --> 01:54:08.04
shipping is free.

1472
01:54:08.04 --> 01:54:13.20
It was in January, but now it's free period.

1473
01:54:13.20 --> 01:54:14.04
Straight up.

1474
01:54:14.04 --> 01:54:15.80
Free period.

1475
01:54:15.80 --> 01:54:18.52
And if you subscribe, you save money, too.

1476
01:54:18.52 --> 01:54:19.48
You save like cost.

1477
01:54:19.48 --> 01:54:21.36
The cost goes down by 10%.

1478
01:54:21.36 --> 01:54:25.72
So if you want to be prepared,

1479
01:54:27.04 --> 01:54:28.72
if you want to be competitive,

1480
01:54:29.88 --> 01:54:33.000
and you want to help out your bank account,

1481
01:54:34.16 --> 01:54:37.64
hey, go subscribe and the shipping is free.

1482
01:54:38.52 --> 01:54:40.20
And you get 10% off, which is pretty cool.

1483
01:54:40.20 --> 01:54:43.48
So we're trying to make this stuff more available

1484
01:54:43.48 --> 01:54:45.40
easier to everybody.

1485
01:54:45.40 --> 01:54:46.64
So that's what we're doing.

1486
01:54:46.64 --> 01:54:49.76

That's going to help you later.

It's going to help you.

1495
01:55:04.64 --> 01:55:06.04
All these things are going to help you later.

1496
01:55:06.04 --> 01:55:07.32
Yep, in the campaign.

1497
01:55:07.32 --> 01:55:08.08
True, sorry.

1498
01:55:08.08 --> 01:55:11.88
Also, other things are going to help you later.

1499
01:55:11.88 --> 01:55:13.68
You can also get this stuff at Wawa,

1500
01:55:13.68 --> 01:55:16.04
where you can get the ready to drink.

1501
01:55:16.04 --> 01:55:16.88
What do you drink?

1502
01:55:16.88 --> 01:55:17.64
What do you have tonight, Dave?

1503
01:55:17.64 --> 01:55:19.56
You went too deep and so did I.

1504
01:55:19.56 --> 01:55:20.60
We started recording late.

1505
01:55:20.60 --> 01:55:23.36
We both kind of like, it was a early morning.

1506
01:55:23.36 --> 01:55:24.20
I know that.

1507
01:55:24.20 --> 01:55:25.04
Well, flavors did we go?

1508
01:55:25.04 --> 01:55:27.56
I went afterburn orange with a deck savage.

1509
01:55:27.56 --> 01:55:28.40
Follow up.

1510
01:55:28.40 --> 01:55:31.32
I went, jacer, deck savage, jacer.

1511
01:55:31.32 --> 01:55:33.76
I went, I went, I went,

1512
01:55:33.76 --> 01:55:34.76
I went, jockel Palmer.

1513
01:55:34.76 --> 01:55:40.12
And then I went sour apple sniper, JP, appreciate it.

1514
01:55:40.12 --> 01:55:41.12
That's what I went.

1515
01:55:41.12 --> 01:55:45.24
So I went, we both went back to back, back to back, back to back.

1516
01:55:45.24 --> 01:55:46.24
I don't do that very often.

1517
01:55:46.24 --> 01:55:47.48
No, I was thinking too.

1518
01:55:47.48 --> 01:55:49.88
I don't usually start hitting this, this late at night.

1519
01:55:49.88 --> 01:55:51.08
But I know it's an idea.

1520
01:55:51.08 --> 01:55:52.52
I have work to do when I get home too.

1521
01:55:52.52 --> 01:55:54.84
So that's a positive thing.

1522
01:55:54.84 --> 01:55:55.84
You can get it.

1523
01:55:55.84 --> 01:55:57.48
You can also get the stuff at the vitamin shop.

1524
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:01.68
So hit those up or get the free shipping.

1525
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:03.28
There you go.

1526
01:56:03.28 --> 01:56:04.28
It's true.

1527
01:56:04.28 --> 01:56:07.36
Also at originmane.com, this week, you can get stuff as well.

1528
01:56:07.36 --> 01:56:08.36
Yeah.

1529
01:56:08.36 --> 01:56:10.36
It's a lot of other cool stuff at origin.

1530
01:56:10.36 --> 01:56:11.84
Originmane.com.

1531
01:56:11.84 --> 01:56:14.24
All American made stuff by the way.

1532
01:56:14.24 --> 01:56:17.16
The boots, jeans, jiu-jitsu stuff.

1533
01:56:17.16 --> 01:56:18.96
Do you ever watch Pete?

1534
01:56:18.96 --> 01:56:20.28
Do you ever watch Pete?

1535
01:56:20.28 --> 01:56:24.44
Do you ever watch the origin USA Instagram story?

1536
01:56:24.44 --> 01:56:26.08
Yes.

1537
01:56:26.08 --> 01:56:28.04
So the other day Pete Roberts.

1538
01:56:28.04 --> 01:56:29.20
Sure.

1539
01:56:29.20 --> 01:56:34.04
He made a story about how he was all fired up because he bought.

1540
01:56:34.04 --> 01:56:38.12
We bought originusa.com.

1541
01:56:38.12 --> 01:56:39.12
Okay.

1542
01:56:39.12 --> 01:56:40.12
The domain name.

1543
01:56:40.12 --> 01:56:41.12
The domain name.

1544
01:56:41.12 --> 01:56:42.60
And he was all fired up.

1545
01:56:42.60 --> 01:56:48.12
And he was, he spent 50 grand on that.

1546
01:56:48.12 --> 01:56:49.12
And he's all fired up.

1547
01:56:49.12 --> 01:56:50.72
I don't know if you do.

1548
01:56:50.72 --> 01:56:53.40
Do you know anything about buying what's called the URL?

1549
01:56:53.40 --> 01:56:54.40
Do you know anything about this?

1550
01:56:54.40 --> 01:56:55.40
Yes.

1551
01:56:55.40 --> 01:57:02.12
So if it's a kind of a good word, they can be very, very expensive.

1552
01:57:02.12 --> 01:57:07.08
IE for originusa 50 grand.

1553
01:57:07.08 --> 01:57:08.48
$50,000.

1554
01:57:08.48 --> 01:57:09.48
And he's on there.

1555
01:57:09.48 --> 01:57:13.08
And he's like, you know, a couple of years ago, I wouldn't even dreamt of spending 50

1556
01:57:13.08 --> 01:57:14.08
grand for this.

1557
01:57:14.08 --> 01:57:15.08
But this is where we're going.

1558
01:57:15.08 --> 01:57:17.08
We need this new URL.

1559
01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:18.48
So we're doing it.

1560
01:57:18.48 --> 01:57:20.48
We're executing.

1561
01:57:20.48 --> 01:57:25.24
And I didn't, I didn't have time because I saw the story.

1562
01:57:25.24 --> 01:57:32.08
We, me, also bought another domain name, which will be a big one.

1563
01:57:32.08 --> 01:57:34.36
We up soon.

1564
01:57:34.36 --> 01:57:41.84
And people, you could argue would say this is even more valuable name URL.

1565
01:57:41.84 --> 01:57:46.32
I bought jaco.com.

1566
01:57:46.32 --> 01:57:47.48
Jaco.com.

1567
01:57:47.48 --> 01:57:52.24
And I almost posted this because what I was going to say, and this is the true story,

1568
01:57:52.24 --> 01:57:54.48
I bought jaco.com.

1569
01:57:54.48 --> 01:57:55.80
How much do you think I paid for it?

1570
01:57:55.80 --> 01:57:57.44
Originusa costs 50 grand.

1571
01:57:57.44 --> 01:57:58.44
Dave, what do you think?

1572
01:57:58.44 --> 01:57:59.44
How much do you think I paid for?

1573
01:57:59.44 --> 01:58:01.32
I think it's unfair for me to answer this question.

1574
01:58:01.32 --> 01:58:02.32
So you already know the answer.

1575
01:58:02.32 --> 01:58:03.72
It makes you so you can get it.

1576
01:58:03.72 --> 01:58:09.76
So if you want to, so I got jaco.com for $1.

1577
01:58:09.76 --> 01:58:11.48
Now awesome guy owned it.

1578
01:58:11.48 --> 01:58:12.76
And he's a trooper.

1579
01:58:12.76 --> 01:58:13.76
He's in the game.

1580
01:58:13.76 --> 01:58:17.48
And he just reached out to Jamie and said, hey, I own jaco.

1581
01:58:17.48 --> 01:58:18.76
And we get all kinds of things.

1582
01:58:18.76 --> 01:58:19.76
We get all kinds of Jamie for us.

1583
01:58:19.76 --> 01:58:20.76
He said, hey, what do we do?

1584
01:58:20.76 --> 01:58:21.76
Hey, what do we do?

1585
01:58:21.76 --> 01:58:23.36
I see one title to an email.

1586
01:58:23.36 --> 01:58:24.36
It says jaco.com.

1587
01:58:24.36 --> 01:58:26.36
And I opened it up.

1588
01:58:26.36 --> 01:58:28.36
And Jamie's like, hey, do you want me to do anything with this?

1589
01:58:28.36 --> 01:58:31.96
And he wants to sell me jaco.com for $1. And he also came out here with his wife.

1590
01:58:31.96 --> 01:58:32.96
We had a cool time.

1591
01:58:32.96 --> 01:58:33.96
We hung out.

1592
01:58:33.96 --> 01:58:38.72
But yeah, so I was going to post that Pete, the business man, Pete the negotiator.

1593
01:58:38.72 --> 01:58:45.96
I was going to say, hey, my business partner, Pete, great job negotiating the price to $50,000.

1594
01:58:45.96 --> 01:58:49.84
Meanwhile, I got jaco.com for $1.

1595
01:58:49.84 --> 01:58:51.72
You know what that is right there?

1596
01:58:51.72 --> 01:58:53.44
Come, competition.

1597
01:58:53.44 --> 01:58:54.44
I beat you, Pete.

1598
01:58:54.44 --> 01:58:55.44
Yes, sir.

1599
01:58:55.44 --> 01:58:57.44
That's a below market price.

1600
01:58:57.44 --> 01:58:58.44
So yeah, for sure.

1601
01:58:58.44 --> 01:58:59.44
I was super cool.

1602
01:58:59.44 --> 01:59:03.08
So that should be up soon, jaco.com.

1603
01:59:03.08 --> 01:59:04.80
And yes, I won that competition, Pete.

1604
01:59:04.80 --> 01:59:05.80
Cool.

1605
01:59:05.80 --> 01:59:07.96
So urgent went from Maine to straight up USA.

1606
01:59:07.96 --> 01:59:08.96
Expanding.

1607
01:59:08.96 --> 01:59:09.96
It's not there yet.

1608
01:59:09.96 --> 01:59:10.96
Right now, go to the job.

1609
01:59:10.96 --> 01:59:11.96
But you jaco fuel.

1610
01:59:11.96 --> 01:59:14.60
Oh, I also bought jaco fuel.

1611
01:59:14.60 --> 01:59:15.60
I think I bought that one.

1612
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:16.60
Did you buy that one?

1613
01:59:16.60 --> 01:59:17.60
What'd you pay for?

1614
01:59:17.60 --> 01:59:18.60
$9.

1615
01:59:18.60 --> 01:59:18.60
11.

1616
01:59:18.60 --> 01:59:19.60
You got to love it.

1617
01:59:19.60 --> 01:59:20.60
You know, market price.

1618
01:59:20.60 --> 01:59:21.60
Market price.

1619
01:59:21.60 --> 01:59:22.60
I don't know.

1620
01:59:22.60 --> 01:59:23.60
I think you did buy that either way.

1621
01:59:23.60 --> 01:59:24.60
Yes.

1622
01:59:24.60 --> 01:59:25.60
It's true.

1623
01:59:25.60 --> 01:59:26.60
Always come on.

1624
01:59:26.60 --> 01:59:27.36
I bought that a long time ago.

1625
01:59:27.36 --> 01:59:28.36
Yeah.

1626
01:59:28.36 --> 01:59:29.36
Check.

1627
01:59:29.36 --> 01:59:32.52
But yes, so yeah, origin Maine soon to be origin USA.

1628
01:59:32.52 --> 01:59:33.52
Doc on this cool.

1629
01:59:33.52 --> 01:59:36.76
It's where you can get Americans made stuff.

1630
01:59:36.76 --> 01:59:39.12
Also, we have the store.

1631
01:59:39.12 --> 01:59:40.52
JacoStore.com.

1632
01:59:40.52 --> 01:59:41.52
I bought that one.

1633
01:59:41.52 --> 01:59:44.08
By the way, back in the day.

1634
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:45.08
This is where you can get this money.

1635
01:59:45.08 --> 01:59:46.08
Could you put that name here?

1636
01:59:46.08 --> 01:59:47.08
Sure.

1637
01:59:47.08 --> 01:59:49.28
I think you thought of that one.

1638
01:59:49.28 --> 01:59:50.28
No, actually, I know I didn't.

1639
01:59:50.28 --> 01:59:51.52
I like, I go, what is it?

1640
01:59:51.52 --> 01:59:52.52
You like, jacoStore.

1641
01:59:52.52 --> 01:59:54.28
I was like, oh, I guess we're going with that thing.

1642
01:59:54.28 --> 01:59:56.12
Yes, it's not hard when to figure out.

1643
01:59:56.12 --> 01:59:57.12
I remember two.

1644
01:59:57.12 --> 02:00:00.08
We're like, yeah, jacoPotCats because it's simple or whatever.

1645
02:00:00.08 --> 02:00:01.88
I was like, I had to online store.

1646
02:00:01.88 --> 02:00:03.88
There you go, jacoStore.

1647
02:00:03.88 --> 02:00:04.88
Oh, there.

1648
02:00:04.88 --> 02:00:05.88
And, you know, it's yours.

1649
02:00:05.88 --> 02:00:06.88
So, boom.

1650
02:00:06.88 --> 02:00:07.88
Anyway, this is where you can get this money.

1651
02:00:07.88 --> 02:00:12.88
You can see them shirts and hoodies and hats and, a lot of cool stuff there.

1652
02:00:12.88 --> 02:00:15.96
There's a T-shirt club called the shirt locker.

1653
02:00:15.96 --> 02:00:18.16
You want to tell us that it?

1654
02:00:18.16 --> 02:00:19.16
I did.

1655
02:00:19.16 --> 02:00:23.88
So, you know, you no longer have to say T-shirt club, which sounds super wack.

1656
02:00:23.88 --> 02:00:26.24
You can just say we all swept the shirt locker.

1657
02:00:26.24 --> 02:00:29.76
You can just say it in a much cooler way.

1658
02:00:29.76 --> 02:00:30.76
Yeah.

1659
02:00:30.76 --> 02:00:31.76
Okay.

1660
02:00:31.76 --> 02:00:35.16
You can just exclude the lame things that sometimes get said.

1661
02:00:35.16 --> 02:00:36.16
Yeah.

1662
02:00:36.16 --> 02:00:37.16
My king shirt.

1663
02:00:37.16 --> 02:00:38.16
Okay.

1664
02:00:38.16 --> 02:00:42.44
Well, thank you for coaching me up there.

1665
02:00:42.44 --> 02:00:44.44
Jaco, there's the shirt.

1666
02:00:44.44 --> 02:00:45.44
Sure.

1667
02:00:45.44 --> 02:00:49.24
Sure, locker where you can get a new cool T-shirt every month.

1668
02:00:49.24 --> 02:00:53.88
High quality, high speed, low drag, as Jaco always says, either way.

1669
02:00:53.88 --> 02:00:54.88
You've never actually heard me say.

1670
02:00:54.88 --> 02:00:55.88
It's like, it's a good thing.

1671
02:00:55.88 --> 02:00:58.28
You can go to check out, it's a good thing to check out.

1672
02:00:58.28 --> 02:01:00.92
So, hey, man, if you think that's cool going to do that, it's that.

1673
02:01:00.92 --> 02:01:03.32
Chocolate store, so like I said.

1674
02:01:03.32 --> 02:01:06.68
You didn't mention the fact that at origin mained.com, you can also get jeans.

1675
02:01:06.68 --> 02:01:07.68
You can get boots.

1676
02:01:07.68 --> 02:01:08.68
Did you?

1677
02:01:08.68 --> 02:01:09.68
Yeah.

1678
02:01:09.68 --> 02:01:10.68
Dave, did you say that?

1679
02:01:10.68 --> 02:01:12.96
Dude, this week can be going to for two years.

1680
02:01:12.96 --> 02:01:14.80
I have no recollection of you saying that.

1681
02:01:14.80 --> 02:01:15.80
Okay.

1682
02:01:15.80 --> 02:01:17.68
Well, there's jeans and boots and guess what they're American made.

1683
02:01:17.68 --> 02:01:18.68
That was a bad.

1684
02:01:18.68 --> 02:01:19.68
True.

1685
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:20.68
That's absolutely true.

1686
02:01:20.68 --> 02:01:22.68
Hey, kid, so review the tape.

1687
02:01:22.68 --> 02:01:23.68
No editing.

1688
02:01:23.68 --> 02:01:26.76
This is going to sound like a dumb question from you.

1689
02:01:26.76 --> 02:01:27.76
Yes, sir.

1690
02:01:27.76 --> 02:01:28.76
Okay.

1691
02:01:28.76 --> 02:01:29.76
Okay.

1692
02:01:29.76 --> 02:01:30.76
Bear with me.

1693
02:01:30.76 --> 02:01:33.80
So the origin boots are those good for snow.

1694
02:01:33.80 --> 02:01:34.80
Yeah.

1695
02:01:34.80 --> 02:01:38.28
I mean, I know what you're tracking, but like, yeah, so if you're snow.

1696
02:01:38.28 --> 02:01:39.68
Yes, if you're out in your ins know, they're good.

1697
02:01:39.68 --> 02:01:44.68
If you're going to go on a winter hike in the woods, they're not going to be optimal,

1698
02:01:44.68 --> 02:01:45.68
because they don't have any insulation.

1699
02:01:45.68 --> 02:01:49.92
Now, if you put on a pair of wool socks and maybe a little polypropylene socks underneath

1700
02:01:49.92 --> 02:01:51.32
them, you might be pretty good to go.

1701
02:01:51.32 --> 02:01:56.40
Plus if you add it a little, you know, waterproofing to it, you know, you got some oils.

1702
02:01:56.40 --> 02:01:57.40
You can put in there.

1703
02:01:57.40 --> 02:01:58.40
You'd be good to go.

1704
02:01:58.40 --> 02:01:59.40
Go on it.

1705
02:01:59.40 --> 02:02:04.20
But if you're going on a trip to the mountains where you're going to be, it's going

1706
02:02:04.20 --> 02:02:05.20
to be called when you're walking around.

1707
02:02:05.20 --> 02:02:06.20
You'll be good to go.

1708
02:02:06.20 --> 02:02:07.20
No, almost stuff.

1709
02:02:07.20 --> 02:02:08.20
Yeah.

1710
02:02:08.20 --> 02:02:10.24
I figured that what I guess is not a dumb question, right?

1711
02:02:10.24 --> 02:02:11.24
I thought it was a good question.

1712
02:02:11.24 --> 02:02:12.88
Well, and they're in Maine.

1713
02:02:12.88 --> 02:02:17.28
Yeah, norm on it would be a dumb question if you were from Maine.

1714
02:02:17.28 --> 02:02:20.12
Being that you're from Hawaii, it's actually a totally legit question.

1715
02:02:20.12 --> 02:02:25.72
Your environment has not taught you lessons that a new Englander would learn or someone

1716
02:02:25.72 --> 02:02:29.92
from Michigan or Montana would learn.

1717
02:02:29.92 --> 02:02:32.28
Why oming people wouldn't be asking me that question?

1718
02:02:32.28 --> 02:02:33.28
No.

1719
02:02:33.28 --> 02:02:36.88
So it's not common knowledge for people like us from the Ina.

1720
02:02:36.88 --> 02:02:37.88
All right, cool.

1721
02:02:37.88 --> 02:02:38.88
Boom.

1722
02:02:38.88 --> 02:02:39.88
There it is.

1723
02:02:39.88 --> 02:02:46.48
Also, subscribe to this podcast if you want and leave a review on your podcast player.

1724
02:02:46.48 --> 02:02:47.48
Of choice.

1725
02:02:47.48 --> 02:02:51.80
Yeah, and we also have, you can join the the Jocco Underground.

1726
02:02:51.80 --> 02:02:52.80
Jocco Underground.com.

1727
02:02:52.80 --> 02:02:54.80
There's some people are asking questions.

1728
02:02:54.80 --> 02:02:56.40
Wait a second.

1729
02:02:56.40 --> 02:02:57.40
What's happening?

1730
02:02:57.40 --> 02:02:58.40
Yes.

1731
02:02:58.40 --> 02:03:00.40
And I'm like, oh, I explained it.

1732
02:03:00.40 --> 02:03:02.40
This podcast, Jocco podcast.

1733
02:03:02.40 --> 02:03:04.52
The goal is to never change this.

1734
02:03:04.52 --> 02:03:08.88
The goal is to never put this podcast behind a paywall.

1735
02:03:08.88 --> 02:03:11.32
That's the goal.

1736
02:03:11.32 --> 02:03:14.000
We want this to be free.

1737
02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.44
And as long as that is humanly possible, it will be.

1738
02:03:17.44 --> 02:03:23.32
And the only thing you will have to suffer through is this section that we're listening

1739
02:03:23.32 --> 02:03:24.32
to right now.

1740
02:03:24.32 --> 02:03:26.28
If you can bear with that, which you didn't even have to.

1741
02:03:26.28 --> 02:03:30.12
In fact, I know that there's only four of you listening right now.

1742
02:03:30.12 --> 02:03:32.68
If you can bear that, you can listen to this for free.

1743
02:03:32.68 --> 02:03:36.28
And you can also just press stop and you didn't have to hear any of this crap.

1744
02:03:36.28 --> 02:03:37.28
Thank you.

1745
02:03:37.28 --> 02:03:41.48
But look, we also, we set this up as a contingency.

1746
02:03:41.48 --> 02:03:44.92
So we have an alternative platform that we built.

1747
02:03:44.92 --> 02:03:46.32
We don't want to have other sponsors.

1748
02:03:46.32 --> 02:03:50.48
We don't have somebody cutting in when we're talking about the battle of the bulge

1749
02:03:50.48 --> 02:03:54.84
to tell you about what kind of underwear you should use.

1750
02:03:54.84 --> 02:03:57.12
We don't want that to happen.

1751
02:03:57.12 --> 02:04:01.68
So if you want to help us out with that, you can go and you subscribe to the

1752
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:02.68
Underground.

1753
02:04:02.68 --> 02:04:08.32
And in order to give you some benefit, a tangible benefit, we're recording another podcast

1754
02:04:08.32 --> 02:04:11.64
called the Jocco Underground podcast.

1755
02:04:11.64 --> 02:04:14.92
And we just kind of give some other information.

1756
02:04:14.92 --> 02:04:15.92
They're a little bit shorter.

1757
02:04:15.92 --> 02:04:22.56
They're just, they're just, it's a behind the scenes, some, some amplifying information

1758
02:04:22.56 --> 02:04:26.000
about what we talk about, some of the where this podcast came from, how I thought of doing

1759
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.92
this, why we're doing this.

1760
02:04:27.92 --> 02:04:31.80
So if you want, you can do other, you're going to jocco Underground.com.

1761
02:04:31.80 --> 02:04:37.96
It's $8.18 a month, which is an important number.

1762
02:04:37.96 --> 02:04:42.80
And look, we're not trying to prevent people from being able to get this information.

1763
02:04:42.80 --> 02:04:47.68
If you can't afford that, and you still want to listen to the Jocco Underground podcast,

1764
02:04:47.68 --> 02:04:48.68
it's cool.

1765
02:04:48.68 --> 02:04:53.40

02:04:53.40 --> 02:04:57.88
And we will hook you up and you will be able to listen to the Jocco Underground podcast.

1767
02:04:57.88 --> 02:04:59.40
So we have that going on.

1768
02:04:59.40 --> 02:05:02.000
And well, we also have, what else we have?

1769
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:08.48
We've got the unraveling, which actually Darrell and I are in, we are in deep, got

1770
02:05:08.48 --> 02:05:12.64
a bunch of stuff that we will have coming you away from coming you away from the unraveling

1771
02:05:12.64 --> 02:05:13.64
podcast.

1772
02:05:13.64 --> 02:05:22.24
We have the Grounded podcast, which we need to, we need to do that and the Warrior Kid

1773
02:05:22.24 --> 02:05:23.24
podcast.

1774
02:05:23.24 --> 02:05:31.76
Again, I said this the other day, I owe a buck on January 31st and when that's done, my

1775
02:05:31.76 --> 02:05:34.28
plan is to knock out some Warrior Kid podcast.

1776
02:05:34.28 --> 02:05:39.92
We got a YouTube channel where Echo puts up all the videos of this podcast and other

1777
02:05:39.92 --> 02:05:46.04
videos where he makes a bunch of stuff blow up using CGI because he thinks it's cool.

1778
02:05:46.04 --> 02:05:48.48
It's 100% cool.

1779
02:05:48.48 --> 02:05:49.48
Thank you.

1780
02:05:49.48 --> 02:05:52.60
Well, that's just your opinion.

1781
02:05:52.60 --> 02:05:56.60
We have an album called Psychological Warfare where I talk about overcoming moments of

1782
02:05:56.60 --> 02:05:57.60
weakness.

1783
02:05:57.60 --> 02:06:01.12
Flipside Canvas, Dakota Myers company, a bunch of cool stuff to hang on your wall, got a

1784
02:06:01.12 --> 02:06:07.84
bunch of books, leadership strategy, and tactics field manual.

1785
02:06:07.84 --> 02:06:12.60
Which I pull out to read quotes from all the time when I'm talking to clients.

1786
02:06:12.60 --> 02:06:13.60
Oh yeah, that's a question.

1787
02:06:13.60 --> 02:06:15.60
I heard about this here.

1788
02:06:15.60 --> 02:06:20.16
Dave, all the time.

1789
02:06:20.16 --> 02:06:21.48
All the time.

1790
02:06:21.48 --> 02:06:28.32
So if you've got questions about what to actually do as a leader, get leadership strategy

1791
02:06:28.32 --> 02:06:29.48
in tactics field manual.

1792
02:06:29.48 --> 02:06:31.56
We also have the code, the evaluations, the protocols.

1793
02:06:31.56 --> 02:06:33.16
We have discipline, equals freedom, field manual.

1794
02:06:33.16 --> 02:06:34.16
There's a new version.

1795
02:06:34.16 --> 02:06:37.24
We have way of the Warrior Kid for field manual.

1796
02:06:37.24 --> 02:06:39.08
We also have way of the Warrior Kid 1, 2, and 3.

1797
02:06:39.08 --> 02:06:42.56
We have about face by David Hackworth that I wrote the form for the new one.

1798
02:06:42.56 --> 02:06:47.36
Mike in the Dragons, which a lot of people say is the best picture book ever.

1799
02:06:47.36 --> 02:06:50.68
A lot of people saying that.

1800
02:06:50.68 --> 02:06:51.68
Most people.

1801
02:06:51.68 --> 02:06:54.08
Sure I'm saying that.

1802
02:06:54.08 --> 02:06:58.56
We have a, and then of course, a tree ownership in the Dakota Leadership.

1803
02:06:58.56 --> 02:07:01.000
We have Escelon Front, which is our leadership consultancy.

1804
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.88
Go to Escelonfront.com if you want help in your organization.

1805
02:07:04.88 --> 02:07:07.000
We saw problems with leadership.

1806
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.24
EF online, which is online courses about leadership that you can bring your whole company

1807
02:07:12.24 --> 02:07:13.24
through.

1808
02:07:13.24 --> 02:07:14.72
They can do a method on pace.

1809
02:07:14.72 --> 02:07:15.72
You can do it as a group.

1810
02:07:15.72 --> 02:07:19.88
It's all kinds of ways to go through that program that will get your whole company, your

1811
02:07:19.88 --> 02:07:25.80
whole team aligned and thinking the same way about leadership.

1812
02:07:25.80 --> 02:07:30.36
We have, we have a live event that we do a few times a year.

1813
02:07:30.36 --> 02:07:32.88
2020, we didn't do any.

1814
02:07:32.88 --> 02:07:36.40
Because there was a virus out there.

1815
02:07:36.40 --> 02:07:39.48
2021, we're reorganizing our dates.

1816
02:07:39.48 --> 02:07:40.48
We're planning to do it.

1817
02:07:40.48 --> 02:07:41.48
Go to extremotorship.com.

1818
02:07:41.48 --> 02:07:46.68
If you want to come to that, EF Overwatch, we have leaders to place inside your company that

1819
02:07:46.68 --> 02:07:50.68
have a military background that understand these principles that we talk about.

1820
02:07:50.68 --> 02:07:54.08

1825
02:08:15.64 --> 02:08:21.16
need more of Ecos bewildered bemoaning.

1826
02:08:21.16 --> 02:08:28.04
Or Dave's fanatical phrasing, you can find us on the in a web on Twitter, on Instagram, which

1827
02:08:28.04 --> 02:08:35.52
for those of you that only understand what Ecos says, he refers to that as the gram.

1828
02:08:35.52 --> 02:08:39.80
And Facebook, Dave is at David Arborick, Ecos at Ecos and I am at Jockel Wink.

1829
02:08:39.80 --> 02:08:49.24
And thanks to all the people in uniform worldwide doing what you have to do so we can do

1830
02:08:49.24 --> 02:08:53.04
what we want to do in the same goes to our police and law enforcement, firefighters,

1831
02:08:53.04 --> 02:08:59.40
and the eMT's dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, and all

1832
02:08:59.40 --> 02:09:01.12
first responders.

1833
02:09:01.12 --> 02:09:04.84
We thank you as well for what you do every day.

1834
02:09:04.84 --> 02:09:12.20
And everyone else out there, competition is an enduring condition.

1835
02:09:12.20 --> 02:09:13.68
It's always happening.

1836
02:09:13.68 --> 02:09:17.48
It's always happening.

1837
02:09:17.48 --> 02:09:19.36
And you need to be prepared.

1838
02:09:19.36 --> 02:09:26.40
And you need to make sure you are competing for the strategic win for the long term win.

1839
02:09:26.40 --> 02:09:33.68
So pay attention to what you are paying attention to.

1840
02:09:33.68 --> 02:09:37.12
And then keep getting after it.
