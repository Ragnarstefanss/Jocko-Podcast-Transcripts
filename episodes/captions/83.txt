[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 83 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:10] On the 19th of February
[00:00:13] 1945
[00:00:16] after three days of heavy
[00:00:20] pre-landing bombardment
[00:00:23] which attempted to destroy the
[00:00:24] heavy fortifications that the Japanese had built.
[00:00:31] On that day, the 19th of February 1945 in American amphibious forces,
[00:00:39] primarily US Marines of the third, fourth, and fifth,
[00:00:45] marine divisions along with soldiers from the US Army's 147th Infantry Regiment
[00:00:52] landed on the island of Ewo Jima.
[00:00:58] By the end of the first day, some battalions had it
[00:01:01] caches the rate of over 80 percent
[00:01:07] on the morning of 20 February 1945
[00:01:15] Marine Corps first lieutenant Isaacs
[00:01:18] was taken cover in a foxhole
[00:01:20] about 300 yards from the beach when he was hit by a Japanese mortar strike.
[00:01:28] He was severely wounded and his left arm and in his head.
[00:01:35] He was evacuated to a hospital ship offshore
[00:01:40] which is where he died the next day
[00:01:42] on February 21st 1945.
[00:01:50] And it was about two months prior to that
[00:01:55] on December 17th 1945 that first lieutenant
[00:02:00] Leonard Smith Isaacs had written a letter
[00:02:04] to his two boys.
[00:02:06] Now, I have a lot of people ask me questions about parenting.
[00:02:14] I got four kids so two people want to know my thoughts on it.
[00:02:19] People also obviously ask me about war
[00:02:22] and they ask me what kind of advice I have for my son.
[00:02:29] And I think that first lieutenant Isaacs answers many
[00:02:33] of these questions a lot better than I ever could.
[00:02:41] And here's what he told them in that letter.
[00:02:47] December 17th 1944, my dear little boys,
[00:02:54] I'm writing you today just a week before Christmas Eve in the hope
[00:02:59] that you will get this little note at Christmas time.
[00:03:04] All of this coming week will be holidays.
[00:03:07] And I can just imagine the fun you will be having,
[00:03:10] especially when you know it's just a few days before Santa Claus will be coming.
[00:03:16] If it were possible, I would like to come down the chimney myself
[00:03:19] and crawl right into your stocking. Wouldn't that be a surprise?
[00:03:23] I would enjoy it even more than you.
[00:03:25] But since your dad is far away and Santa Claus has the only rain
[00:03:31] gears that will fly through ear, I'm afraid we'll have to let Santa Claus use them.
[00:03:37] After all, he has so many places to go in such a short time.
[00:03:44] I won't be able to give you a Christmas present personally this year.
[00:03:49] But I do want you to know that I think of you all the time and feel very proud
[00:03:55] of the way you have been helping your mother while I'm gone.
[00:03:59] I know that it's only natural for young, healthy and strong boys like you are
[00:04:04] to want to play and have fun all the time.
[00:04:08] But I do want you to think about helping mummy
[00:04:12] because it is hard for her to do everything while I'm gone.
[00:04:17] I know that you would like to give me a Christmas present too.
[00:04:20] So I will tell you what you can do and this will be your Christmas present to me.
[00:04:27] Every day ask mummy if there are errands that you can do for her.
[00:04:31] And when there are errands to run, say sure, mommy, and then give her a big smile.
[00:04:35] Then during the day, go up to your room and look around.
[00:04:38] If there are toys scattered all around or you left some of your clothes on the floor, pick them up.
[00:04:45] Also, when mummy is busy trying to clean up the house,
[00:04:49] don't leave her by herself.
[00:04:51] But ask mummy if you can help her take care of baby sister.
[00:04:56] If you do those things for me, that will be the finest Christmas present that you could give me.
[00:05:03] Oh yes, and CC, are you eating your meals like a real man now?
[00:05:11] Well, my boys, I guess you often wonder why people fight and have wars
[00:05:16] and why lots of daddies have to be a way this Christmas time at fighting.
[00:05:22] When it would be much nicer to be at home.
[00:05:27] That's a hard question to answer.
[00:05:29] But you see, some countries like Japan and Germany have people living in them, just like people, you and I know.
[00:05:37] Those people want to tell everybody what they can do and what they can't do.
[00:05:42] No one likes to be told how to live their life.
[00:05:48] I know that you wouldn't like it if one of the boys in the neighborhood tried to tell you what church you should go to,
[00:05:53] what school you should go to, and particularly if that boy would always be trying to beat up some smaller or weaker boy.
[00:06:02] You wouldn't like it would you?
[00:06:05] And unfortunately, the only way to make a person like that stop these sort of things or a country like
[00:06:11] Japan or Germany is to fight them and beat them and teach them that being a bully because after all,
[00:06:19] that's what they are, is not the way to live and that we won't put up with it.
[00:06:26] What does all of this mean to you just simply this, my boys,
[00:06:31] dad doesn't ever want you to be a bully.
[00:06:34] I want you to always fight against anyone who tries to be one.
[00:06:37] I want you to always help the smaller fellow or the little boy who may not be as strong as you.
[00:06:44] I want you to always share what you have with the other fellow and above all my boys have courage.
[00:06:51] Have courage to do the things that you think are right.
[00:06:56] Never be afraid to fight for what you think is right.
[00:07:00] To do those things, you need a strong body and a brave heart.
[00:07:04] Never run away from someone you may be afraid of.
[00:07:09] If you do, you will feel ashamed of yourself and before long, you will find it so easy to run away
[00:07:15] from the things that you should stand up and fight against.
[00:07:21] If you and lots of other boys try to do the things that dad has been talking about in this
[00:07:26] letter, it may be that people will not have to fight wars in the years to come.
[00:07:31] And then all the daddies in this world will be home for Christmas.
[00:07:41] And that is where they belong.
[00:07:46] Perhaps some of the things that I've been talking about, you don't quite understand.
[00:07:52] If you don't, mommy will explain them to you.
[00:07:55] She knows.
[00:08:01] Merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:08:06] God bless you.
[00:08:08] Daddy.
[00:08:09] And obviously, many brave American students fought for what they believed in on that tiny island of
[00:08:32] Ewo Jima. And they suffered massive losses to gain that victory over the course of that five
[00:08:47] week battle, 19,217 were wounded, 6,800 and 21 were killed.
[00:09:04] And first lieutenant Leonard Smith, Isaacs, Marine, husband, father,
[00:09:17] daddy was buried at sea.
[00:09:31] 34 years old.
[00:09:32] .
[00:09:46] Reading that letter made me think about another letter I had read from another parent.
[00:09:53] And it's another letter that I find to be just an incredible guide to not only to parenting,
[00:10:04] but to living.
[00:10:08] And this one was written, not by a father, but by a mother.
[00:10:15] And it's not a letter to a son, but to a daughter.
[00:10:18] And the daughter's name was Jana.
[00:10:25] Then the mother's name was Dr. Mejalda Hora Kova.
[00:10:32] And she wrote the letter from prison.
[00:10:36] And while she was on trial for treason and for conspiracy, on trial by the Soviet backed communist
[00:10:47] government of Czechoslovakia after they had taken control of the country in a coup.
[00:10:54] And she and her fellow so-called conspirators were jailed and tortured and then put through a grandiose
[00:11:09] show trial. In China, she knew that she was going to be made an example of
[00:11:22] China. She was facing death.
[00:11:35] And the night before her execution, she wrote a letter to her daughter.
[00:11:45] Who was 16 at the time, and this is some of what you wrote.
[00:11:58] My only little girl, Jana, God blessed my life as a woman with you.
[00:12:05] As your father wrote in the poem from German prison, God gave you to us because he loved us.
[00:12:18] Apart from your father's magic, amazing love, you were the greatest gift I received from fate.
[00:12:28] However, Providence planned my life in such a way that I could not give you nearly all that my mind
[00:12:33] and heart had prepared for you. The reason was not that I loved you little. I love you just as
[00:12:42] purely and fervently as other mothers love their children. But I understood that my task here in the
[00:12:50] world was to do you good by seeing to it that life becomes better and that all children can live well.
[00:13:03] And therefore, we often had to be apart for a long time.
[00:13:07] That is now already for the second time that fate has torn us apart.
[00:13:21] Don't be frightened and sad because I am not coming back anymore.
[00:13:25] Learn my child to look at life early as a serious matter. Life is hard. It does not pamper anybody.
[00:13:42] And for every time it strokes you, it gives you 10 blows. Become accustomed to that soon.
[00:13:49] But don't let it defeat you. Decide to fight. Have courage and clear goals and you will win over life.
[00:14:03] Much is still unclear to your young mind and I don't have time left to explain to you things
[00:14:09] I would you would still like to ask me. One day when you grow up you will wonder and wonder
[00:14:16] why your mother who loved you and whose greatest gift you were managed her life so strangely.
[00:14:24] Perhaps then you will find the right solution to this problem. Perhaps a better one than I could
[00:14:30] give you today myself. Of course you will not only be able to solve it correctly and truthfully
[00:14:40] by knowing very very much not only from books but from people. Learn from everybody.
[00:14:48] No matter how unimportant. Go through the world with open eyes. And listen not only to your own
[00:14:59] pains and interests but also to the pains, interests and longings of others.
[00:15:05] Don't ever think of anything as none of your business. No everything must interest you.
[00:15:14] Then you should reflect about everything. Compare and compose individual phenomena.
[00:15:22] Man doesn't live in the world alone. In that there is great happiness but also a tremendous
[00:15:31] responsibility. That obligation is first of all and not being an acting exclusive but rather
[00:15:39] merging with the needs and the goals of others. This does not mean to be lost in the multitude
[00:15:48] but it is to know that I am part of all and to bring one's best into that community.
[00:15:54] If you do that you will succeed in contributing to the common goals of human society.
[00:16:04] Be more aware of one principle than I have been. Approach everything in life constructively.
[00:16:10] Be aware of unnecessary negation. I'm not saying all negation because I believe that one should
[00:16:19] resist evil. But in order to be a truly positive person in all circumstances one has to learn
[00:16:27] how to distinguish real gold from tinsel. It is hard because tinsel sometimes glitter so dazzingly.
[00:16:38] I can fest my child that often in my life I was dazzled by glitter.
[00:16:43] And sometimes it even shone so falsely that one dropped pure gold from one's hand and reached
[00:16:52] for a ran after false gold. You know that to organize one's scales of values means
[00:17:03] to know not only one's self well but to be in firm and in the analysis of one's character.
[00:17:11] But also to know others to know as much as possible of the world. It's past, it's present,
[00:17:21] and future. In short, to understand. Not to close one's ears before anything and for no reason.
[00:17:33] Not even to shut out the thoughts and opinions of anybody who stepped on my toes or even wounded
[00:17:38] me deeply. Examin. Think. Criticize. Yes, mainly criticize yourself.
[00:17:54] Don't be ashamed to admit a truth. You have come to realize even though you proclaim the opposite
[00:18:01] a little while ago. Don't become obstinate about your opinions. But when you come to consider
[00:18:14] something right, then be so definite that you can fight, then die for it.
[00:18:22] As Walker said, death is not bad. Just avoid gradual dying, which is what happens when one suddenly
[00:18:30] finds oneself apart from the real life of others. You have to put down your roots where fate has
[00:18:38] determined you to live. You have to find your own way. Look for it independently. Don't let
[00:18:44] anything turn you away from it. Not even the memory of your mother and father. If you really love
[00:18:51] them, you won't hurt them by seeing them critically. Just don't go on a road which is wrong,
[00:18:58] dishonest and does not harmonize with life. I have changed my mind many times, rearranged many
[00:19:08] values, but what was left in as an essential value without which I cannot imagine my life is the
[00:19:17] freedom of my conscience. I would like you my little girl to think about whether I was right.
[00:19:33] Another value is work. I don't know which to assign the first place and which the second,
[00:19:39] learn to love work. Any work, but one you have to really know really and thoroughly. Then don't
[00:19:49] be afraid of anything and things will turn out well for you. And don't forget about love in your life.
[00:19:57] I'm not only thinking of the red blossom which one day will bloom in your heart and you,
[00:20:03] if fate favors you, will find a similar one in the heart of another person with whose road yours
[00:20:09] will merge. I'm thinking of love without which one cannot live happily. I don't ever crumble love,
[00:20:19] learn to give it whole and really. And learn to love precisely those who encourage love so little.
[00:20:29] My little girl, Janna, when you will be choosing for whom your maiden heart shall burn and to
[00:20:40] whom to really give yourself. Remember your father. I don't know if you will meet with such luck as I.
[00:20:49] I don't know if you will meet such a beautiful human being but choose your ideal close to him.
[00:20:56] Perhaps you, my little one, have already begun to understand and now perhaps you understand to
[00:21:04] the point of pain what we have lost in him. What I find hardest to bear is that I am also
[00:21:13] guilty of that loss. I've heard from my legal representative that you are doing well in school
[00:21:22] and that you want to continue. I was very pleased. But even if you would one day have to leave school
[00:21:30] and work for your livelihood, don't stop learning and study. If you really want to, you will reach your goal.
[00:21:39] I would have liked for you to become a medical doctor. You remember that we talked about it.
[00:21:44] Of course you will decide yourself and circumstances will too. But if you stand one day in the
[00:21:55] traditional alma mater and carry home from graduation, not only your doctors to ploma,
[00:22:01] but also the real ability to bring people relief as a doctor, then my little girl,
[00:22:06] your mother will be immensely pleased. But your mother would only be truly happy no matter where you stand.
[00:22:20] Whether at the operating table, at the lathe, at your child's cradle or at the work table in your
[00:22:27] household, if you will do your work skillfully, honestly, happily and with your whole being,
[00:22:38] then you will be successful in it. Don't be demanding in life, but have high goals.
[00:22:49] They are not exclusive of each other. For what I call demanding are those selfish notions and needs,
[00:22:59] restrict them from yourself. Realize that in view of the disaster and sorrow which happened to you,
[00:23:09] Vera, Pepeck, grandmother and grandfather and many others will try to give you what they have and
[00:23:15] what they cannot afford. You should not only not ask for it, but learn to be modest.
[00:23:26] If you become used to it, you will not be unhappy because of material things you don't have.
[00:23:33] You don't know how free one feels if one trains oneself and modesty.
[00:23:37] How he or she gets a head start over against the feeble. And by how much one is safer and stronger,
[00:23:51] I really tried this out on myself. And if you can thus double your strength,
[00:23:56] you can set yourself courageous high goals.
[00:24:00] Read much and study languages. You will thereby broaden your life and multiply its content.
[00:24:12] There was a time in my life when I read voraciously. And then again, times when
[00:24:17] worked did not permit me to take a single book in my hand, apart from professional literature.
[00:24:23] That was a shame. Here in recent months, I've been reading a lot,
[00:24:28] even books which probably would not interest me outside. But it is a big and important task to
[00:24:35] read everything valuable or at least much that is. I shall write down for you at the end of this
[00:24:42] letter what I have read in recent months. I'm sure you will think of me when you will be reading it.
[00:24:49] And now also something for your body. I'm glad that you are engaged in sports.
[00:24:59] Just do it systematically. I think that there should be rhythmic exercises. And if you have time also,
[00:25:07] some good systematic gymnastics. And those quarter hours every morning,
[00:25:13] believe me, finally, that it would save you a lot of annoyance about unfavorable proportions of
[00:25:21] your waist if you could really do it. It is also good for the training of your will and perseverance.
[00:25:35] Your photograph showed me your new hairdo. It looks good, but it isn't a shame to hide your nice
[00:25:42] forehead and that lady in the ball gown. Really, you look lovely. But your mother's eye noticed one fault,
[00:25:50] which may be due to the way you were placed on the photograph. Wasn't the neck opening a little
[00:25:54] deep for your 16 years? Don't primp. But whenever possible, dress carefully and neatly.
[00:26:05] Jenna, please take good care of grandfather and grandmother.
[00:26:17] Their old hearts now need the most consolation. Visit them often and let them tell you about your
[00:26:25] fathers and mothers youth so that you can preserve it in your mind for your children.
[00:26:30] In that way, an individual becomes immortal and we shall continue in you and the others of your blood.
[00:26:44] And one more thing, music. I believe you will show your gratitude to grandfather
[00:26:52] for the piano which he gave you by practicing honestly and that you will succeed in what
[00:26:57] Pepek wants so much in accompanying him when he plays the violin or the viola.
[00:27:04] Please do not favor. I know that it would mean a lot to him and it would be beautiful.
[00:27:12] And when you can play well together, play me the Aria from Martha. My rose you bloom alone there
[00:27:20] on the hillside and then sleep my little prince by Mozart and then your father's favorite
[00:27:28] under your window by Chopin. You'll play it for me won't you? I shall always be listening to you.
[00:27:40] Just one more thing. Choose your friends carefully. Among other things, one is also very
[00:27:51] much determined by the people with whom one associates associates. Therefore choose very carefully.
[00:28:01] Be careful in everything and listen to the opinions of others about your girlfriends without being told.
[00:28:07] I shall never forget your charming letter. Today I can tell you which you once in the
[00:28:14] evening pinned to my pillow to apologize when I caught you for the first time at the gate in the
[00:28:19] company of a girl and a boy. You explained to me at that time why it is necessary to have a gang.
[00:28:29] Have your gang little girl but of good and clean young people.
[00:28:33] And compete with each other in everything good. Only please don't confuse young people spring time
[00:28:42] in factuation with real love. Do you understand me? If you don't, on Vera will help you explain
[00:28:53] what I meant. And so my only young daughter, little girl, Jenna, new life, my hope,
[00:29:10] my future forgiveness, live, grasp life with both hands.
[00:29:23] Until my last breath, I shall pray for your happiness, my dear child.
[00:29:29] I kiss your hair, eyes and mouth. I stroke you and hold you in my arms.
[00:29:43] I shall always be with you.
[00:29:57] For the next day, despite international outcry, Milada, Hora-Kova, was executed at Prags
[00:30:20] and crack prison.
[00:30:27] Again, there's just so much to be learned from those letters and parents.
[00:30:46] There's so much for us to teach and I think the thing that hits me is that these are all things
[00:30:58] that we know. We know them. We know to take care of our health. We know to wake up and exercise.
[00:31:06] We know we should choose our friends carefully. We know we should be our own worst critics.
[00:31:18] We know that if we have been wrong about something, we should simply admit that and move our minds
[00:31:26] to what is right and what is correct. We know we should work hard and help people.
[00:31:31] We know the value of freedom and we know that freedom must be fought for.
[00:31:47] We know that we should be brave and that that is possible only through a strong body, mind and heart.
[00:31:55] And we know all those things we know them.
[00:32:05] Now teach them.
[00:32:13] Teach them and live them.
[00:32:18] Set the right example by living them.
[00:32:28] Because our children are watching.
[00:32:40] They're watching it.
[00:32:42] I think you have to do more than just set the example.
[00:32:53] You actually have to tell them.
[00:32:57] Think about the power of these letters.
[00:33:02] The power of these words.
[00:33:05] But it's also a real challenge with kids.
[00:33:08] With your own children, it's a challenge because there's a crazy, parental child psychology that's
[00:33:15] going on here. You got the rebellion or the trying to please you or the competing for attention
[00:33:24] or the I can't do anything good enough.
[00:33:27] You've got all these psychological things that are going on with your kids.
[00:33:31] And it's hard. It can be very hard just to be straight with your kids about stuff.
[00:33:39] It can be hard not to micromanage them. That's one of the hardest things because you know so
[00:33:43] wow all these things that we just talked about. You know them and you know that they're the best
[00:33:47] things for your kids. And yet if you push them to intensely, they're going to push back.
[00:33:56] Or they're going to push, they're going to head into different direction.
[00:34:00] Because you pushed them there.
[00:34:04] But I do think that there's some real value in taking the time to explain
[00:34:12] what you've learned. The mistakes that you've made.
[00:34:15] I think it's key not to so much focus on telling them how to live. I think this is the key.
[00:34:21] It's not so much focus on telling them how to live. But telling them how you have lived.
[00:34:29] The mistakes that you've made and how you try to live.
[00:34:35] So that maybe they can learn from some of the mistakes that you've made without
[00:34:44] having to learn from life itself. Which sometimes life is a much more brutal teacher.
[00:34:59] In fact most of the time. And if you have to learn from life, sometimes you don't win.
[00:35:06] And harsh. Yeah.
[00:35:15] Parenting is challenging.
[00:35:18] Part that I thought think is very important.
[00:35:26] The most important maybe is when you said our children are watching.
[00:35:34] So you know remember the old saying, do what I say not what I do. That doesn't work.
[00:35:42] Because you tell someone, hey don't don't I don't know what don't smoke. Don't don't try cigarettes.
[00:35:47] Meanwhile you smoke. They're going to be like okay don't try cigarettes. You know whatever.
[00:35:52] You know they're always like everyday, all day, everyday they're watching. To see how to
[00:35:57] what act. I don't know how to act. I don't know what to do in this whole. You know how like when you
[00:36:04] walk into a party of someone you don't know. And maybe it's a really nice party or something.
[00:36:10] And maybe it's a different culture or something like that. You're looking around. What do I
[00:36:14] act? Are we taking off our shoes right here? Okay we're taking off our shoes. Are we are we are we eating
[00:36:19] now? Are we waiting for a prayer or something? What do we do? What are we doing? You're constantly
[00:36:23] looking on how to add no kids. That's their whole life. Yeah. How do I act? I don't know how to act.
[00:36:29] So of course you're there the whole time. You got things figured out. You got a car. You got a house.
[00:36:35] You're providing my food. You're going to show me how to act. So you start saying hey don't smoke.
[00:36:41] Meanwhile 100% of the time you're acting in a way that allows for smoking.
[00:36:48] I mean, maybe like okay. By the way it's the same exact thing from a leadership perspective.
[00:36:54] Yeah. The way you act is a leader. It's not I mean that you're not going to have people that are
[00:36:59] as moldable as a kid is. But there's no doubt. If the way you act as leaders the way your team is
[00:37:05] going to act there's no that's 100%. Yeah. And if you act like a clown your team is going to act
[00:37:10] like clowns. If you take your job seriously your team is going to take your job seriously. If you're
[00:37:15] very well balanced in between those two where you take your job seriously, but you still have a
[00:37:20] good time with the doing it your team is going to follow you with that as well. I remember when I was
[00:37:24] a new guy in a shield balloon. I would be watching those my leaders all the time and taking you know
[00:37:31] when they didn't do something when they didn't hold the line when they were late or didn't bring the
[00:37:35] IP's a gear it was just yeah. You just look at him and shake your head. Now I wanted to perform
[00:37:41] but what that meant are the people's like say doesn't matter if we really perform that well look
[00:37:44] the boss does new and perform well. Yeah. And so you're setting your body. Yeah you're subordinates are
[00:37:50] watching. Yeah everybody's watching. Everybody's watching. You know how people will be like you know
[00:37:54] hey I'm the type of person that does this you know I really and everyone knows bad know you're not
[00:38:00] we've been watching you the whole time I've known you kind of think. So yeah especially like the
[00:38:04] boss too even even I mean you get all kinds of different people right in the in the work environment.
[00:38:09] So you you're like driven it comes from yourself. You're like really self like motivated and stuff.
[00:38:14] Pretty much. Yeah kind of. So it let's even if you have a bunch of self motivated people
[00:38:21] they're still watching you like so if you're like kind of the leader and you're like hey you know
[00:38:24] we're getting we're punctual people we get our work done early like we're this kind of and then
[00:38:29] meanwhile you're coming in late or whatever the boss is coming in late and he's slacking you could
[00:38:33] tell he's slacking he's passing like his job off off you know on to others and that kind of stuff.
[00:38:38] At the very least they're gonna look at you and not have the respect it I think you should have
[00:38:45] as a boss or whatever. Yeah the very least and that's if you have self motivated people.
[00:38:50] But otherwise the normal situation I can't I remember feeling that all the time where I think
[00:38:55] about this I'm not going to listen to this guy man. Yeah man it's you know what's interesting to
[00:39:02] is just think about and I know we've done all the letters from parents especially from parents
[00:39:08] that are you know headed for death or at least a high probability of death but what would you say
[00:39:16] to your kids if you knew you were heading there and is it not worth telling them that at some point
[00:39:25] while you're alive and you can you can say hey look if you know I'm alive to tell you this
[00:39:30] stuff this is what I want you to know again now what's crazy is even with that you have to you
[00:39:36] can't override your kids with the gack this way you can't do that you gotta approach it you got
[00:39:43] a flank them you got a flank them you got I got a flank my kids my kid you know they're not I think
[00:39:50] the classic example is my son he's got it to jiu-jiu right he's been trained in jiu-jiu
[00:39:56] ten years right he's 14 he's been trained in his whole life right but he's not as good at jiu-jiu as
[00:40:05] I am I mean he's just not because he's been trained in for ten I've been trained in for
[00:40:09] twenty something so you can beat him I can beat him yes yes but but check it out what's funny is
[00:40:17] I'm his dad so when I tell him a son move your hips over here dude you don't need to do that
[00:40:24] I'm thinking myself you've got to be kidding me you've got to be kidding me that is the
[00:40:28] content to me that's the ultimate example of your kids are not going to listen to you they're
[00:40:35] programmed the programmed to reject you at some point they have to move on right that's the way
[00:40:42] the species works if they just continue to take from you and they don't reject you at some point
[00:40:48] and get away from you then you didn't do a good job as a parent because now they're relying on you
[00:40:53] so but that comes a little price the price is that rebellion right the rebellion's going to come
[00:41:00] and it's you know you can you can identify it you know my youngest it's so nice you know you tell
[00:41:07] her something and she's just got the big eyes and she wants to help and wants to please and wants
[00:41:10] to do and and understand and I'll tell you something else there's another end of the spectrum too
[00:41:15] because my oldest daughter she went through the rebellion she's already through that and she got
[00:41:22] through it pretty quickly to where she would like look at me and thank you and thank you
[00:41:25] you could see it in her eyes that she's thinking he knows what he's talking about and I'm going
[00:41:29] to listen to what he's saying now it does it's probably like a 50% right there it's not 100%
[00:41:35] I'm not just dialing it 100% victory on telling her what to do because otherwise what's sad about
[00:41:40] that this is what's horrible about that if you could get a child to actually do everything that
[00:41:46] you wanted them to do they would dominate in life right because you would just say okay well you
[00:41:51] just study hard I want you to work out I want you to do everything that I'm not doing
[00:41:55] because I'm lazy and I fell short of my own goals you'd have to do all that stuff
[00:42:01] they're not going to do it so you got to flank you got to figure you also got to figure
[00:42:05] which ones are important right which ones are really important don't waste your leadership
[00:42:10] capital on you know getting your kids to dress a certain way right that's one parents will
[00:42:17] spend all kinds of leadership capital on getting their kids to what dresses are in the way and the
[00:42:23] reality is I mean obviously you've got to remain taint some standard of decency and cleanliness
[00:42:34] that's another leap by example sit you yeah yeah it is it is my daughters went through little
[00:42:41] phase of wearing the short really short jeans or not not jeans but shorts yeah I was like okay cool
[00:42:49] I was walking on one day at my house I had like a pair of workout shorts on or whatever
[00:42:54] I just pulled them right up yeah and we're just walking on how do I look hey if we're going to show
[00:42:59] off let's just show it off right I got a little something to I do squats check me out
[00:43:03] big girls come up to the agony yeah come on stop yeah that's stopping no that's disgusting yeah
[00:43:12] if we're showing off but let's show them off yes I'm over here on the squad but squad rack
[00:43:20] let's sport it got it fun you apparently are falling in so let's all flaunt it let's go into town
[00:43:25] who's coming with me yeah no no but you but you can only spend so much leadership capital on
[00:43:31] getting these minor corrections made what you want to make sure is that they have good morals
[00:43:36] value so go out and town they know where to draw the line on doing stuff that's good or not good yeah
[00:43:44] you know somebody asked me a question on Twitter I didn't actually answer it fully but you know he's
[00:43:48] okay you seem to be really black and white about good or evil but I think there's a lot of shades
[00:43:51] of gray in there and I totally agree of course I mean there's there's massive amounts of shades of gray
[00:43:57] in good and evil and then at some point you get to evil yeah but you go from like hey this is
[00:44:04] bad to evil and you go from you know hey that's pretty nice to good those those are things that
[00:44:10] exist and you want to keep your kids you know out of the evil right and if you waste all your
[00:44:19] leadership capital trying to push them from doing okay and it's a good and doing the best and
[00:44:26] you're going to wear it all out in my opinion if there's some parents that have done a better
[00:44:30] job than me that's awesome and they were able to just to keep their kid five point oh and every
[00:44:35] category across the board for their all existence without the kid turning into a crazy you know
[00:44:40] rebel because that's what happens to some kids that get pushed that hard yeah yeah I think that
[00:44:47] all again that all leading by example thing man is like as long as you're consistent and lead by
[00:44:52] example they can see you know they'll see the benefits play out right in front of their face
[00:44:57] yeah but man these again you can you can be like hey clean your room meanwhile the rest of
[00:45:03] house including your room is messy and grab clean I tell you to clean your room all the time you never
[00:45:08] do no how's this so when I'm my friends uh one of my best friends they've scuddy Lewis he's a cop
[00:45:15] by the way you know on the big I know so this guy would he was never my roommate but you know I
[00:45:23] go to his house a lot of time and he was real like client clean he was a super clean guy and he'd get
[00:45:28] kind of mad not mad but just uncomfortable and things are dirty you know so you know if he has a
[00:45:33] roommate or something like that and I remember thinking dang bros just got a real sensitive about
[00:45:39] that whole thing you know being clean and they're like for real clean clean a clean clean not a
[00:45:44] clean freak necessarily but I'm borderline borderline yes so thumbs and just from knowing them
[00:45:51] and stuff I knew that his parents they would like you know clean his room and stuff like that
[00:45:58] not all the time or nothing like that but they were involved in cleaning and stuff so it kind of
[00:46:02] went opposite to what I thought you know like if your parents tell if you got taught to clean your
[00:46:08] room from young age and you had to do it the whole time yeah I always thought that yeah that
[00:46:13] would carry over when you're out of the house and you go to college you go live on your own
[00:46:17] that you clean your room all the time I thought that that was kind of it but I started hypothesized
[00:46:23] that that's not it this is what it is if your parents provide an environment of extreme
[00:46:29] cleanliness whether you do it or they do it or both or whatever but the environment is consistently clean
[00:46:35] when you leave that environment that's will be that'll be what you're used to it's a little mess
[00:46:40] with you if it's not and that's and sure enough we went to the big of and you know crazy
[00:46:46] and we go to his house and it's like museum the spotless clean not his his parents house
[00:46:54] and I remember thinking like yeah that my little theory I think is correct yeah like if you're
[00:46:59] used to doing it did his parents help him clean or not yes fully so here and here's the thing
[00:47:04] because because you could also get the kid that the parents are neat freaks and the kid rebels
[00:47:08] and just becomes a slob yeah so and yeah maybe and I'm sure there's all kinds of circumstance
[00:47:14] that maybe do that I'm sure but I mean generally speaking the environment that you get used to
[00:47:19] functioning also there's people there's parents that are slob's that the kids are very
[00:47:24] neat nor do they because they don't like that yeah yeah I mean maybe and again these are all
[00:47:29] you know I'm sure there's so many five I've never encountered that well my I think the key is here
[00:47:35] what you can't do is just trying to push them like crazy you just have to guide them and what
[00:47:40] is correct and what you have to really show is like the benefits of why it's good to keep things
[00:47:46] in order you know if you're gonna spend an hour looking for your car keys just think of your
[00:47:53] productivity at that point it's no yeah so you gotta watch out for that yeah but yeah that was
[00:48:00] my little hypothesis I think it's true though because think about like think about just the environment
[00:48:05] of the the consistent environment that you kind of that it someone will come from they always in a way
[00:48:12] sort of for lack of better to create recreate that environment or try to when they leave so like
[00:48:17] you know how like kids they come from a chaotic people yell out yeah they're gonna probably yell a lot
[00:48:22] or let's say they don't yell let's say they never swear right they like I grew up in a household
[00:48:27] and they don't swear and swearing like not that good when they go out they won't just start swearing
[00:48:31] though they'll be sensitive to swearing for sure so I think if that again if the environment is
[00:48:36] provided consistently I think that's that's gonna have a big consistency goes a long way
[00:48:42] oh I think it's the number one thing Sarah Armstrong always says that yeah I agree with there
[00:48:46] thousand million people you consistent right even like small little things like for my
[00:48:52] doctor for example it's the routine is when it's time to go to bed it's brush teeth we do
[00:48:59] stories and questions which is like just you know some stories that I mean and then questions like
[00:49:03] basically a quiz it's like rudimentary education like solar system stuff and you make it like a
[00:49:08] game show quiz so it's fun and then bed time that's it then sleep 100% no deviation unless we're
[00:49:18] out but that's how you roll that's the routine consistent so now I don't get any push back
[00:49:24] my daughter is a push back she is master in that the consistency it's up she just knows she
[00:49:30] just go you can be playing she's she's got a little spark to her yeah I actually just got a lot of
[00:49:36] spark to her yeah yeah there's just a ton you know as I was going through these I don't remember
[00:49:45] where I let read the you know I don't remember where I read this letter for the first time
[00:49:51] from Milata or a kova but there's so much good stuff in there chose your friends carefully
[00:50:00] I mean just just when she's kicking it off you know life is hard it does not pamper anybody
[00:50:08] that's a good thing for kids to understand yeah you know welcome to life it's going to be hard
[00:50:13] get accustomed to it but don't let it defeat you boom yeah that's changing of your opinion one was
[00:50:20] yeah yeah and admitting when you're wrong if I made this if I made if I had the wrong theory
[00:50:26] that's okay yeah I'm just good for me you information here we go I'm changing that's okay
[00:50:31] I was kind of freaked me out with politicians I think you've had this conversation before
[00:50:35] politicians people say we've flipped flop flip flop for you and that's a negative thing
[00:50:39] it's a negative thing if the person is flip flopping just to get votes yeah and it's not
[00:50:44] but if new stuff comes to light and they say you know what I kind of changed my opinion on that one yeah
[00:50:48] yeah or the culture shifts man like there's certain things that's even I mean back to your
[00:50:54] thing with the short shorts that's I mean pointy is a little bit different but you have to
[00:50:58] contend with yeah cultural history that's a new reality for me like in in Hawaii for example when
[00:51:04] I grew up like just the swimsuits um we're you know sure you wear bikini but it's like a normal bikini
[00:51:10] so I come I got a college I come here I move here I go back this is like you know 10 11 years
[00:51:17] later I'm noticing the bikinis in there it's just way less material I'm like dang there's
[00:51:22] they're showing a lot but everyone's just you know little kids and stuff like I'm okay and my
[00:51:26] younger brother will live there you said that's just how this is now is like man you you wouldn't
[00:51:30] know that's that's that's some stuff that I had to like go okay I'm not gonna expend a
[00:51:34] natural leadership capital fighting not just my kids but fighting culture as a whole yeah that's
[00:51:41] but then there's things that cross the line right yeah you wear in those short shorts that's
[00:51:47] not that delay you don't want to see me in those short shorts you don't want to have that happen
[00:51:54] so um like I said it's a good information from Captain Isaacs and from Doctor Hork over
[00:52:06] but you know speaking of learning and teaching and questioning speaking of question time sure
[00:52:15] I think we have a little question time to contend with you okay you're nay yeah might as well so let's uh
[00:52:23] ask Jocco some questions let's do that I like your answers to questions Jocco
[00:52:30] see that's kind of the good thing about knowing your phone number I could just text you with questions
[00:52:36] like purse my own questions a gross mismanagement of your time it is potentially however I'm pretty
[00:52:42] quick to answer yeah abruptly in short answers you know because you pretty much know what the answer
[00:52:50] is gonna be I do and sometimes you just need that backup and that's or that that reinforcement you
[00:52:55] know you know you know how like you're like man I really have I have in this issue with myself
[00:53:00] whatever like I'm gonna I'm gonna ask Jocco only because it's really I'm really confused
[00:53:06] not confused but you know I'm really I need the answer I don't have the I'm really want to I'm gonna ask Jocco and
[00:53:11] you can be texting Jocco the answer or the question and you're like I know that answer like as I'm
[00:53:17] reading this question to Jocco it kind of fits into it yeah so don't send it so you get about maybe
[00:53:23] a third and like a quarter of the questions that I actually started for you yeah that's good
[00:53:29] yeah man see good you know the Jocco effect is real question number one Jocco I keep trying to ask
[00:53:36] around my BJJ school if anyone follows S and C program did now you just abbreviate S and C you know
[00:53:43] what that is right no oh it's strength and conditioning okay sure all hundred percent
[00:53:50] that's like a known thing especially for someone that's jacked like no it's not
[00:53:55] just interesting thing condition I don't right I've never seen that you know that's maybe it'll
[00:54:00] write that maybe I just do it that through credit just credit Mike drop you know I'm not
[00:54:07] anyway I'm asking around my BJJ school if anyone follows a strength and conditioning program
[00:54:13] for comps which is competition very good nicely done you're up on things everyone keeps telling
[00:54:20] me to just roll for strength and conditioning what do you think about that okay so rolling is
[00:54:27] obviously the base right you need to roll and that but that has to it that this doesn't mean
[00:54:32] include rolling like we're gonna go roll however it works out it means rolling with some kind of
[00:54:39] structure around it so you get your short rounds you got to get your long rounds you got to get your
[00:54:46] shark tanks you got to get your positional drilling you got to get your consequence free drills
[00:54:52] like Dean Lister makes us do consequence free drills where you're gonna start in a position where
[00:54:59] you might get tapped out but it doesn't matter all right right or you're gonna start a position
[00:55:03] where you might lose position but you're gonna do it anyways and and then Glover that's what Dean does
[00:55:08] actually Glover does the consequence drills where you hear already like starting in the arm lock
[00:55:15] yeah yeah yeah you're letting a person take your arm and you're starting there and you're just
[00:55:19] gonna see what you can get out of it or start in the triangle not the triangle danger in the triangle
[00:55:24] yeah that's some Jeff Glover you know we did that crap right there but it's good for you it's good
[00:55:32] so you got to you got to do that you know and the short rounds by short rounds I mean short
[00:55:36] intense rounds yeah right if you I'm my attitude in a three-minute round is completely different
[00:55:44] than my attitude in a twenty-minute round or even I mean the ultimate and what believe it or not
[00:55:50] my attitude in a twenty-minute round is different from my attitude in a no-time limit round
[00:55:57] really yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's especially because in regular training even if you
[00:56:03] get the submission if I submit you in four minutes I still got to do another sixteen so I might
[00:56:11] go all hard for four minutes and get the submission but then I gotta go another sixteen minutes now
[00:56:15] so I'm gonna I'm gonna have some tactical now if we're now what's different is if it's no time
[00:56:20] limit after four minutes I get you work we're kind of done we can go again yeah but
[00:56:25] we can just be done but if you get them in one minute we're probably going again yeah it's like
[00:56:31] an MV it's in four minutes is probably going again too but like eight minutes so I might I might not
[00:56:37] submit you in one minute or even four minutes because I want to get you to a point where I know
[00:56:45] I'm just gonna have to do this one guy yeah yeah yeah the psychology uh but so yes you have to roll
[00:56:52] now but you still need to get stronger right and a classic example this is a big Andy big Andy
[00:56:58] Burke right great you're just you but it wasn't super strong yeah and I was I said to him hey
[00:57:06] start doing pull-ups start doing push-ups and dips and squats just start to him and he did
[00:57:10] he listened to me and and in a matter of a month he felt completely different because he
[00:57:16] wasn't working on it he was just rolling and he was rolling hard core but just rolling compared
[00:57:21] to actually getting stronger and then he went on to powerlifting and Olympic lifting and now it's
[00:57:28] like okay I gotta contend with actual strength power here so that that definitely makes a difference
[00:57:33] you know his skill was getting better but it wasn't I was feeling it skill getting better you know but
[00:57:36] we're all getting better at the same time but all of a sudden he started getting stronger so strength
[00:57:40] that's the strength part right now the conditioning part same thing due to a how's you to
[00:57:47] rest and that's actually a positive attribute of your due to your game if you can rest while you're doing it
[00:57:54] right that's that's one of the good that's that proves that you know what you're doing
[00:57:58] right now that's actually a negative when it comes to working out because if you do something like
[00:58:04] a row or a bike or a sprint or a medcon workout on a timer there and no mercy
[00:58:12] slacking is not rewarded you're you're you're racing against the clock and so those things are
[00:58:19] gonna push you faster for longer periods of time harder than just a role well so bottom line for
[00:58:29] strength and conditioning and you get to yeah you gotta do you get to for sure gotta be your base
[00:58:37] and then you've got to do strength training to get stronger that's dead and squats and clean
[00:58:45] jerks and snatches and over at squats and all the key lifts and do that means doing singles and
[00:58:50] doubles and fours and fives and sets of 20 I mean it means getting stronger and then you got to
[00:58:57] work your metabolic conditioning and how do you do that you go hard you go metabolic conditions
[00:59:04] do you do met cons right you mix in lighter weights doing more repetitions short and you got
[00:59:11] a mix up the rounds too going short rounds long rounds to bot do you know what to bot is
[00:59:18] to bot a protocol I don't know the exact exact number there's an exact number the exact number
[00:59:23] for the to bot a protocol is 33 no 20 seconds of work 10 seconds of rest okay so for me that's
[00:59:33] like the shortest rounds you're doing is 20 seconds of work 10 seconds of rest then you got all
[00:59:37] to do long rounds and then you do you know a lot of times I do three on one off for rounds that's
[00:59:44] a boxing right a lot of times I'm doing five on one off that's MMA and then above that you start
[00:59:53] to get to Gittu which is 10 minutes will one off but what's interesting is if you're doing a
[00:59:59] 10 minute round and then one off and then another 10 minute round and then one off that blurs
[01:00:03] into one big round so a lot of times when we're getting it got a guy that's competing black
[01:00:07] belt or a or he's doing a 20 minute fight or a 10 minute fight a 10 minute 10 minute grappling
[01:00:13] match one round of 10 minutes or one round of 15 minutes you got to have him take a bigger break
[01:00:19] in between sometimes during the training so that they're actually coming in their fresh
[01:00:23] and they can work through the prom again otherwise they're just going through the one hour roll
[01:00:28] level the whole time which is not good for them and obviously you got to learn technique
[01:00:35] you got to practice technique because Gittu is what's going to win and like I just had somebody
[01:00:41] hit me up on social media and they said because I told a story at some point on this podcast about
[01:00:47] rolling with a black belt girl for the first time as the first time I ever rolled
[01:00:52] with an actual black belt girl and I was thinking you know I better bring my A game a little
[01:00:56] bit so don't get caught here and then when I started rolling with those that's not happening
[01:01:02] and the guy says this is this mean that you can't defeat a stronger opponent with Gittu and I
[01:01:06] said no absolutely my watch girls lighter weaker girls tap out bigger stronger guys on the regular
[01:01:16] but what what that situation was not only was I bigger and stronger but I'm also skilled at Gittu
[01:01:23] yes so doesn't apply yeah and there's this element of Gittu and this actually kind of goes back to
[01:01:31] one Andy when you know when you get Andy with his skill and technique
[01:01:38] and then you add some strength in conditioning to it and it's like you know so what you do if you
[01:01:44] if you don't have if you're not being strong you can't really believe anyone on the man
[01:01:48] bully I don't mean bully bully I mean like you can't just turn on this like if you're not
[01:01:54] yeah if you're seeing Jeff Glover but people because I have well he bullies in in a different way
[01:01:59] like so so and that's what I mean by bully like you can't just impose your strength on someone
[01:02:06] well I'm gonna have to disagree with you can impose your technique yeah I think yeah I mean
[01:02:11] Jeff Glover will bully guys on the mat if they're out of line for sure yeah but in it's in a
[01:02:16] different kind of way so you're talking about you well you can't go strength you can't just
[01:02:21] start bullying physically bullying you have to technically bully it yes so I accept that yeah so let's
[01:02:27] say your technique is is similar and but you have straight up weight strength and conditioning
[01:02:35] yeah it really plays a factor first sure and not to say that you'll be able to necessarily tap
[01:02:40] the guy out but him trying to tap you out when you have strength conditioning and size it's like
[01:02:47] it just gets real hard no for sure and unless you will be the key component there that you
[01:02:52] mentioned is that I have to have similar because you can be a 235 pound like guy super strong
[01:03:02] athlete and if you don't know jjitsu Jeff Glover's gonna wrap you up like you don't even know what's
[01:03:07] happening he's 150 pounds yeah yeah yeah well and he and I've seen him with obviously with what
[01:03:14] roughly 100% certainty with with yeah well you know even beyond roughly 100% it is really really
[01:03:21] close to 100% yeah if you don't know jjitsu 245 pound muscle head going against Jeff Glover you're
[01:03:29] getting tapped out you do know jjitsu there he is yeah for sure there is a video I think is
[01:03:34] crappler's quest I think it's still online right now Jeff Glover goes against this huge
[01:03:38] guy yeah for sure I think yeah he's maybe like I knew some people of you who did you just
[01:03:42] who fighter yeah it was a jjitsu match yeah and helmet it's yeah it's just crazy to watch and
[01:03:47] that was when Jeff was like 13 or something yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the girl you know the
[01:03:58] girl thing and I remember that question was on Twitter right there was like hey it doesn't
[01:04:01] jjitsu allow you yes yeah so they get yeah perfect exact I mean that's the answer there
[01:04:08] because yeah you have all this experience but you know how like how we always talk about like
[01:04:12] when you lock up with someone you know you can get a really good idea of what they're about to
[01:04:16] bring to you yeah this James Nielsen and you lock up and you're like what is it about this should
[01:04:22] be pretty easy oh yeah getting swaps yeah you're not just happy for sure for sure so there are
[01:04:27] exceptions for sure but generally speaking you know even just not even beyond just strength strength
[01:04:33] and their grip and their rigidity and yeah you can feel the you can feel the either like they're
[01:04:39] relaxed to me that's an indicator yeah someone that just like it's one of them yeah they feel
[01:04:43] relaxed you're like okay this is this guy probably knows what he's doing yeah because the person
[01:04:47] that doesn't know what they're doing they're going all psycho yes doing making like little micro moves
[01:04:51] that are incorrect you know yeah just even putting their foot right there it's like bro your
[01:04:55] foot should not be right there right now kind of thing yeah you can tell real quick yeah so but it
[01:04:59] does go into the strength part as well so like you know when you grab someone's wrist or they grab
[01:05:04] your wrist or something like that you're like okay because a lot of you just to this is weird a lot
[01:05:08] of you get to is knowing what's important and what's not in pressure so you know these that's not
[01:05:13] just you get to either because I just talked about that with with kids and with me know you
[01:05:17] and you want to expand your leadership capital trying to get your trying to get your team to do
[01:05:22] something that's not really truly necessary yeah that's not going to help your cause yeah it's not
[01:05:28] going to help you and you did to if you're focused on something that's not important and to know
[01:05:31] what's important and what's not is very important has a leader as a parent and is on the
[01:05:35] duty to play or match yes of justice and very hard by the way it takes like a lot of experience
[01:05:43] so you consider these guys who are like if you do a light role with a really really high level guy
[01:05:49] that's when you can start to see okay this guy really thinks that this arm position is really
[01:05:54] important because he'll fight till the death to kind of maintain it you know so but what the
[01:06:00] bad just back to the girl real quick the girl situation when you lock up with someone's strengthwise
[01:06:04] you know you feel like I said you what they're about to bring so again and when you have the
[01:06:10] more experience you have the more you're gonna know with like more accuracy and that's what you
[01:06:15] and actually this point of taking that point in transferring into leadership is so critical and I'll
[01:06:21] tell you I am really good at knowing what's important and what's not and just be it and you can
[01:06:29] see people that get all spun up about things and you know just okay they're spun up about something
[01:06:35] the same thing with family life you know your your wife gets all spun up about something like what
[01:06:40] we're gonna do we're gonna keep doing what we're doing we're gonna be okay you know oh you want to
[01:06:45] focus all your time and energy on that that's fine go ahead you know that's cool I'll support you
[01:06:49] and you can make it happen but you know think about how important something really is when you're
[01:06:54] getting spun up about something just think about how important it really is there's a good chance
[01:06:59] it's not that important there's a really good chance it's not that important there's usually four
[01:07:04] five things that are really important as a leader that you need to focus on and that list the
[01:07:11] further you go down that list the less important things are and I see leaders get spun up on
[01:07:14] things that are listed on the list number 47 and they're acting like it's the most important thing
[01:07:20] and it's gonna ruin everything and it's like no doesn't just not that big of a deal yeah
[01:07:25] so learn that is that why you wear the same clothes every day you know I wear the same
[01:07:31] because fashion is not important it's not important to me those short rounds are good when you
[01:07:38] do short rounds in jiu jitsu and they kind of trick you too because like Jeff will do that he'll be like
[01:07:42] three minute rounds so you have this thing in your head like oh it's only three minutes it's just
[01:07:46] hard but meanwhile you only got 30 seconds or ask me for you gotta go again so you're doing
[01:07:50] essentially a back on jiu jitsu and that's good that is good so for that kind of stuff yeah man it's good
[01:07:56] yeah agree I like to say some of you got some guys say you don't need strength and
[01:08:00] conditioning because you the more the anytime you spend doing physical activity should be on your
[01:08:04] jiu jitsu they said that's interesting I would like to agree with that it sounds good but I would do
[01:08:11] if I'm gonna do jiu jitsu six hours a day I'd still do strength and conditioning for 20 minutes
[01:08:15] half an hour or four minutes that's one of the good things about jiu jitsu you can have different
[01:08:20] philosophies and still be successful because I think like there it gets Dylan Dennis or somebody
[01:08:26] maybe Marcel Marcel Garcia only does jiu jitsu yeah I know and Dean you still always trying to convince
[01:08:31] me that yeah it's gonna do jiu jitsu let's say no well Dean's all crazy strong though yeah no he's
[01:08:36] that's funny you see the fail just to jiu jitsu when I was just a jiu jitsu and I mean just I
[01:08:41] I don't know why don't do grip strength right now I can hold him to anything for about six hours
[01:08:47] check all right next question jiu jiu jiu jiu I have a question about leadership firefighter
[01:08:54] and someone like guys on my department have been pushing me to step up and put in for an
[01:09:01] officers position and I'm honored but one word one word one we were going to a call I was presented
[01:09:08] with an opportunity to lead and pass it up I don't know what I was thinking I can't believe I did that
[01:09:15] did I just lose credibility if I did is there a was to get that back away right that's what he meant
[01:09:25] yeah if I did is there a way to get that back thanks okay so first of all this is just a general
[01:09:31] rule if you want to lead always be ready to lead right be ready to step up make sure you're not stepping
[01:09:36] on people's toes as always but be ready to lead and the way you do that is you think about you what
[01:09:42] you do in certain situations you should always be thinking about that you should be thinking
[01:09:46] even if you're a trooper or a follower in a certain situation you should think okay well how
[01:09:52] would I lead what would I do right now what moves would I make what would I do if a contingency
[01:09:57] happened right now and what are the possible contingencies that I could be looking at what are
[01:10:01] they and if you're thinking that as a as a frontline guy when the opportunity pops up
[01:10:10] then just jump on it boom there you go then when it does happen of course you've got to
[01:10:16] stay detached because you want to make sure that you don't lead too far you don't overstep
[01:10:22] your bounds and step on toes you've got to be careful that so you need to live with that mindset
[01:10:28] and that will make you such a a better leader when the moment does come if you're always thinking
[01:10:34] about if you're always watching like he talked about earlier I'm watching the leader I'm
[01:10:37] seeing what they're doing I'm seeing what I might do differently I'm still supporting them
[01:10:40] I'm supporting you if you're in charge I'm supporting you but I'm thinking I might I might do this
[01:10:44] and then you watch what would my what would the results of my decision have been compared to what
[01:10:48] they did so you you can be thinking like a leader even though you might not necessarily be in a
[01:10:53] leadership position so live with that mindset that's what you need to do now as far as you
[01:11:01] passing up the opportunity to lead which yes you're admitting was an error first of all say this it
[01:11:07] probably it's probably not quite as obvious to everyone else as it is to you in your mind you're thinking
[01:11:14] all man I blew it this was my chance and I bet the guys went back from that call and didn't even think about it
[01:11:19] didn't even think about it again most likely unless it was just some playground I don't want to lead
[01:11:25] I'm ready if you did that well then yeah people go to the other but if you just said
[01:11:28] if you just kind of backed away from a moment people people might have realized it but anyways regardless
[01:11:34] of that you probably guess what I'm going to say then what you're going to do is I want it
[01:11:38] right you got to own it so when the opportunity presents itself to explain
[01:11:45] what happened and what went wrong and what you did wrong right not making excuses but explain
[01:11:53] where you were weak you know so you say hey guys you know hey remember that last call
[01:12:01] I should have stepped up and I had to have the wrong mindset I wasn't ready to lead and I let
[01:12:06] not only that let you guys down I let myself down and I'm not going to let that happen again from now on
[01:12:12] I'm going to have leadership in the front of my mind that's what I'm going to do
[01:12:15] I'm going to be thinking about what needs to get done I'm going to be thinking about contingencies
[01:12:20] and how I'm going to lead and I promise the next time this opportunity comes up I'm going to be ready to lead
[01:12:25] so I'm sorry for letting you guys down and what happened again okay that's that's it boom
[01:12:34] get the mindset live and think as a leader regardless of what position you're actually in and then
[01:12:42] when they call you in the opportunity presents itself step up and lead
[01:12:47] obviously that's your default mindset now yes it seems obvious to me it is truly was it always
[01:12:59] like that even before that story that I've told over and over again about being on an oil rig and
[01:13:04] coming up and guys not know where to go or everything freezing and me going okay I'm just
[01:13:10] to step back and look around and make a call and when I did that that was it and so I I want to
[01:13:14] click it clicked or I would say I guess I was thinking about it beforehand because I was you know
[01:13:20] observing my leaders and thinking about what they were doing and what I would do differently in a certain
[01:13:24] situation yeah yeah it's crazy because even in everyday life which is what I represent
[01:13:31] everyday life but you know how your life or girl whatever is like hey you know what's the dinner situation
[01:13:38] what do you want oh I don't care whenever you want you know that's a time where I always feel this
[01:13:45] what this guy just asked you know I mean obviously it's nothing compared to his situation but
[01:13:53] like hey what you know what do you think for dinner kind of thing and I'm like I don't I don't care
[01:13:56] and that's really how I feel I don't care I'm kind of down for whatever kind of thing but that's not why
[01:14:02] that's not why she's asking me she wants me she wants me to make the decision she wants me
[01:14:06] and it's step up and be like this what we're having for dinner I'm gonna go get her I'm gonna
[01:14:11] make it or whatever that's what she wants and really those little this those that situation
[01:14:14] comes up all the time that's a good point just like you know the old that the joe actually that's kind
[01:14:18] of like a joke you know when you ask a girl when it goes as or when you ask a girl hey when you
[01:14:23] want to eat and she says I don't I don't care whatever and then you say okay we're gonna go eat here
[01:14:26] and then I really like that of course see yeah you gotta yeah I feel like this guy when I do that
[01:14:33] that's the point so for now when you're gonna step up and leave I'm gonna do it yeah but I
[01:14:37] want it to be my default is why you know like yours is like your default like you know all this
[01:14:41] will do it yeah okay you know what I wish that was true with when it did come to dinner
[01:14:45] actually it's a lot of it kind of is true because I only go to like three places to eat yes
[01:14:50] and I go to one 80% of the time yeah so the other 20% of the time so if she says where you
[01:14:58] want to go I'm gonna say that my restaurant yeah we're gonna raglands and I'll be too
[01:15:02] far here but that makes it harder the right way that she like raglands though she does she does
[01:15:07] which makes it easier yeah but and if she doesn't feel like it then she'll be like I don't
[01:15:13] really want to go there okay cool now it's on you I gave you my vote right now you don't want to do that
[01:15:19] but I think you still gotta do it you still gotta make the decision you gotta like because in
[01:15:24] a way I'm in the same boat as your second scenario there like if she's out of there so
[01:15:30] I'm gonna do that I'm just gonna name my secondary restaurant all right there you go
[01:15:33] maybe she'll say yes maybe she'll say no well that gotta be my default now though
[01:15:40] step up the lead you know what I you know what I gotta do I gotta prepare I gotta prepare myself
[01:15:44] will yeah I gotta have like five options just ready to go on deck that's what I have three
[01:15:51] so that's not what you want to do and they all come to the same order
[01:15:54] I must be really boring hey you focus on what's important that's good well whenever my wife says
[01:16:01] uh you know tell you everyone want to try anything new I said nope yeah I don't I don't yeah
[01:16:07] speaking of which darling you're my girl not looking at something new I'm at the same thing very
[01:16:14] happy yes that's actually that I'm gonna use that one there but what do you do when the team wants
[01:16:20] to try something new all right let's do that all right good tips all right next question
[01:16:28] jockel i'm a sergeant in my country's army the reason that i'm sending you this message is
[01:16:34] because of a tragic incident in our unit this week a young enlisted soldier committed suicide
[01:16:40] he shot himself with his issue rifle this came as a shock to all of us he was a bright
[01:16:45] smart and happy guy damn i'm seeking your advice jockel do you have any advice on how I as a leader
[01:16:52] can talk to the guys about it how does a group of soldier soldiers cope with a loss when the reason
[01:16:59] is so tragic thank you and and obviously condolences to the team the and the family of the soldier
[01:17:13] and i think what you have to do in this situation is you got to as a leader you got to bring
[01:17:18] me out in the open i think one of the worst things you can do is pretend that it didn't happen
[01:17:23] pretend that the problem's gonna go away and i think what you have to do is you have to explain it
[01:17:28] which is weird because in this case explaining it means admitting that you can't explain it
[01:17:34] because you can't explain it or you're not gonna be able to you're gonna be making up
[01:17:39] something that you're guessing at right you're not gonna know what individual what individual
[01:17:45] situations caused this to happen you know because who can make sense of that i mean a bright
[01:17:53] smart happy guy it doesn't make sense and and and won't you can't explain why you i think you
[01:18:04] have to address it as a reality and i think you got to address it as something that your
[01:18:11] pulltune needs to fight against just like they would fight against the enemy
[01:18:17] well what is the threat the threat is depression the threat is loneliness the threat is helplessness
[01:18:23] the threat is feeling like there's no way out and being aware of those threats
[01:18:32] is what allows recognition of the enemy so that you can fight them so i think you got to talk
[01:18:43] about this with your guys i think that they will become aware of what they need to look
[01:18:48] out for in others and in themselves so they can alert the platoon that you know joy if you
[01:18:57] guys talk to johnny man he seems you know johnny seems a little off right now we should check in on him
[01:19:02] we should talk to him or self recognition man i'm feeling like depressed about something i'm feeling
[01:19:09] dark it doesn't i don't know what i'm gonna do right and on that last podcast that we did
[01:19:17] i read a couple excerpts in words from some various combat veterans
[01:19:23] and i touched on the fact that several of them from different times from different wars had
[01:19:31] written the same thing and they wrote basically that death would be liberating and that it would
[01:19:41] be an escape from the hell of war from the memories of war and and i should have hit on that
[01:19:47] harger because i i think that what that means to me what that tells me is that
[01:20:01] is that having those thoughts doesn't necessarily mean that there's something wrong with you
[01:20:08] right it doesn't necessarily mean that you're losing it these you know the the writings that
[01:20:15] i'm talking about the book and the writing from a guy that i knew doesn't mean that you're losing it
[01:20:22] and i think that people think to themselves oh i'm i'm thinking about how death would be an
[01:20:27] easier way right now and and and they think that by thinking that they're they're totally screwed up
[01:20:35] when i think the realities that is or i'm in think the reality of the situation is that that's
[01:20:42] obviously a fairly normal thing to think about and you know i i when i was in Ramani
[01:20:53] i i definitely i i wasn't thinking about killing us but i definitely saw that dying in combat
[01:21:02] was would be a relief to the stress that i was under no doubt and and i didn't want to die but i'll
[01:21:08] say what we joked about it i joked about it with life i'd be like if we get a firefight tonight
[01:21:14] first thing to do is crack a green cameland on my chest so the enemy knows exactly where i'm
[01:21:17] like we're joking because we're under a lot of stress but i think my what i'm trying to say is that
[01:21:26] those feelings or those thoughts don't mean that you're done they just mean that you're human
[01:21:31] um they just mean that you're human and i think if you keep them bottled up
[01:21:38] then they might explode so that's what i think you need to do i thought so i need to tell
[01:21:44] your men that these thoughts happen and that your platoon your team needs to be on guard against them
[01:21:53] and the best way to be on guard is to be vigilant to look for the signs to look for behavior
[01:21:59] and talk about them and then be able to ask for help it's one of the big problems
[01:22:05] guys i want to ask for help because we're macho i don't need help with anything we are egos
[01:22:11] are too big so we don't ask for help and so we have to put our egos in check we got to pay attention
[01:22:19] to each other and there's going to be some people that you're going to have to pry this out of them
[01:22:24] right they're not going to willingly talk about it so i think that's what you have to do so that you
[01:22:29] can get somebody some professional help i'm not a psychiatrist obviously and and in a normal
[01:22:35] infantry platoon there's no psychiatrist in there but you need to recognize because you're the
[01:22:40] first line of defense and how can you get that somebody to a professional that can help them
[01:22:47] and to be honest this doesn't only apply to soldiers right it applies to everyone
[01:22:51] don't let these thoughts fester in your brain you got to get them out you got to put them out
[01:22:59] the light right you got to put them out the light so they so they dry they're like a vampire
[01:23:07] they dry up and they whither and they they turned to dust you know that's what you want to
[01:23:14] your exposums you can get the professional help and get things under control so
[01:23:17] that's the leadership be straightforward with your troops tell them the truth explained the
[01:23:24] enemy threat that's what we're talking about and how you as a platoon are going to look out for it
[01:23:31] and then obviously you got to grieve the loss you got to mourn your fallen comrades and then
[01:23:38] you also have to get back to work get back to soldiering get back to preparing
[01:23:46] for the enemy that you will face on the battlefield with with a new awareness that there's a
[01:23:54] another enemy that can lurk inside lupiltoon and inside the individual and that you have to protect
[01:24:05] each other just like you protect each other from a real enemy so that would probably be the
[01:24:10] route that I would go good luck brother with that sis uh it's a hard one for sure
[01:24:19] next question juggle my leader is not an extreme ownership disciple among other things he's
[01:24:27] fostering division within our team how do I help lead those who no longer trust in the commander
[01:24:34] but are awesome guys who want to stay involved how do I bring them back into the fold without
[01:24:41] threatening our lead or our dear leader all right well first of all you got to become a buffer
[01:24:48] between your boss and your team that's what you need to do um trying to absorb as much
[01:24:54] negativity as you can and make sure you don't spread that negativity right this and also this is a
[01:25:01] delicate situation that we've talked about before if you completely support the boss
[01:25:07] and and and act like the boss is the greatest person in the world the team is going to reject you
[01:25:11] or there's a like a high likelihood that they're going to reject you at the same time if you completely
[01:25:17] reject the boss then you've actually aided in dividing the team because now the team is not
[01:25:24] aligned with the boss so you have to balance you have to balance us in one of the best ways to do this
[01:25:29] is to put listen that's you got to put the importance of the mission and the team above the
[01:25:36] ego's an attitude so here's I'm gonna say something like look guys look guys I know we have
[01:25:45] our differences with the chain of command on some things but we have a job to do all right we have
[01:25:49] a mission to accomplish and even though we might not agree with the boss on everything it's our team
[01:25:55] it's our team and the performance of the team sure it reflects the boss but it reflects us too
[01:26:07] so what I say we do is win let's let's win let's be the best regardless of what the boss does
[01:26:16] oh what the boss says let's win to prove to prove that even with a situation where the leadership
[01:26:27] might be lacking a bit we're so good that we're gonna win anyways who wants to get some of that right
[01:26:37] there you go let's win despite poor leadership that's what we're gonna do any and I'll tell you
[01:26:42] what in my younger and maybe a little less politically savvy days I want to say something like let's win
[01:26:53] not just despite our leadership but let's win two spite our leadership like we would just perform
[01:27:00] so well in the face of a horrible leader we're gonna show everyone what was up the underdog
[01:27:07] Cinderella story we're gonna rock so that's cool you know sometimes you're you're winning
[01:27:13] not just despite your leadership but two spite them I'm done that a couple times in the
[01:27:17] career not not the better not the best one it's better to win despite them so despite we
[01:27:23] we got some rough leadership it's okay and the other thing is you know even when you're doing that
[01:27:28] with a bad leader you still got to be careful that step in the leaders toes and the way you do that
[01:27:34] is really easy you give them all the credit you give them all the credit and that's great and that
[01:27:37] little nagging voice that you got in the back your head that wants credit you know that one I'm talking
[01:27:42] about that you go back there don't worry about that I'm telling you right now you will get the
[01:27:47] credit in the long run you will get the credit don't worry about it you might not get the credit on
[01:27:54] this one or even this week this month maybe not even this year but eventually you will get the credit
[01:28:02] and recognition that you deserve that you want because your boss's boss he knows what's up he knows what's
[01:28:11] up and your troops know what's up and so when everybody knows what's up when you have a truly
[01:28:19] bad leader the truly bad leader doesn't they're not they're not just walking around fooling everyone
[01:28:25] in an organization it's not happening it's not happening and if it does happen it doesn't happen
[01:28:31] for long it only happens there's a limited time that it can happen for because every every
[01:28:38] idiotic move that that leader makes down the chain of command at least one out of every five
[01:28:44] he does some stupid up the chain of command too and so how is that group performance so well
[01:28:49] we know it's not the leader he's an idiot oh they must have some good junior leadership in
[01:28:53] there who's those guys oh that's echo Charles these and charge that squat and they're crushing it
[01:28:58] so don't worry about that just lead and win and give that credit away and it's gonna come back
[01:29:05] to you tenfold that's what you do kind of in a way goes back to like people are watching
[01:29:12] they're watching yeah he's a poor leader he's a poor leader people are gonna pick up on that
[01:29:16] yeah and they're not gonna you know that doesn't mean that the boss's boss is gonna advertise that
[01:29:20] because the boss's boss they're a good leader so the boss's boss is gonna come and undermine them
[01:29:25] yeah no but when the time comes for emotion when the time comes for a reorganization
[01:29:30] that's gonna be happening you know that's where that that's really just means are gonna be made yeah
[01:29:38] but we get so wrapped up we get the ego gets you yeah ego gets you yeah kind of watch out for that thing
[01:29:46] yeah to truly let it go when you don't get the credit and you for real think that you deserve the credit
[01:29:52] the truly let it go there's the challenge yeah that's a challenging one
[01:29:56] relish in that challenge laugh at it yeah you know good boss you did awesome good job
[01:30:03] yeah because I feel like anyway when that does happen you know and so and it's not even
[01:30:09] necessarily someone else gets the credit for what you did it's just that like something big happen and
[01:30:15] it just went completely unnoticed that that it was straight up because of you right that's a
[01:30:20] potential scenario but let's say you don't you don't say anything I think that there is a small
[01:30:26] feeling of satisfaction that you're like you know you took the hero in the same I you know
[01:30:31] completely get that feeling maybe that's my ego yeah let me look at me over here I'm not even saying
[01:30:35] anything I'm giving away so much credit I'm the man that's like the perfect amount of ego
[01:30:40] or perfectly directed ego but because usually it's a clip by the fact that you didn't get your credit
[01:30:47] yeah usually yeah yeah for sure that's hard I want the credit got to work on that
[01:30:54] check next question I have a question about the warrior mentality I recently was dumped on a
[01:31:01] deployment and it's difficult now that I'm home state site how does a warrior handle this is it like
[01:31:08] any other emotional loss I'm trying to use this loss and get after it and improve myself mentally
[01:31:13] and physically not sure how to properly submit questions to the podcast all right so the deer
[01:31:20] John letter the old classic deer John letter and so you know agree sometimes you can keep it
[01:31:26] bay when you're deployed but then when you get home and you get back to the places the familiar
[01:31:31] places where you have the specific memories that's that's where the pain start to come in
[01:31:39] and that's fine you know that's that hurts that's we get that but in my opinion I've said this
[01:31:47] before the person that you built in your mind the person that you had relationship with that you built
[01:31:54] in your mind that person doesn't actually exist they're not real they're not real she wasn't who she
[01:32:04] appeared to be and she isn't who she appeared to be she isn't the sweet understanding fun person
[01:32:12] that you cared so much about that's not her that's your memory that's what you built in your head
[01:32:17] she is actually the self-self centered person that cares about herself first and doesn't care
[01:32:24] about you that's the reality and that's fine but a lot of times the pain that we feel isn't
[01:32:32] based on the reality it's based on the fantasy so you're feeling pain of losing something that wasn't
[01:32:38] real so let the fantasy go remember that she is not the perfect person that you built in your mind
[01:32:48] period she's not otherwise we wouldn't be in this situation right now and then move on brother
[01:32:58] get after it work out train hard go to the kitchen to hike run a blanket hard just get after it
[01:33:07] and those things not only are you going to distract you from the pain which is good they're going
[01:33:12] to improve you as a human being which is good and they're going to rebuild your confidence which is
[01:33:16] good they're going to make you feel good they're going to make you stronger and smarter and better
[01:33:22] and put you into a place where you don't need that little made up fantasy anymore and they're
[01:33:31] going to put you into place where you're going to find something better than the fantasy now i'm
[01:33:35] going to tell you right now the fantasies don't exist the perfect girl or guy for you doesn't exist
[01:33:45] they don't exist so you're going to be out looking for someone that's good but you're not going
[01:33:53] to find perfect don't get obsessed with finding perfect if you find someone that's perfect it's
[01:33:58] it's not true everyone's got their flaws so that's what you have to do and you will end up
[01:34:08] finding someone that's real and I get it man I know you're going to have some moments down in the
[01:34:18] hole as Alice and chains put it or trapped in the heart shaped box as Nirvana put it
[01:34:29] or so lonesome you could cry as Hank Williams senior put it is that you notice a theme here
[01:34:35] this is what people go through but those feelings their temporary so let them say hi
[01:34:45] let them hang around for a minute or for half an hour an hour or whatever and then kick them out
[01:34:50] kick those feelings out get them out of there and go do something else take your mind away from
[01:34:56] those memories of fantasies and put build some good memories that are real and yeah you know what
[01:35:03] you can use your anger and your frustration to fuel positivity for sure I spent much of my youth doing
[01:35:10] that very thing for sure all those breakups yeah I turn those things into fuel and the other
[01:35:21] thing I'm telling you is if you take actually your body your mind's going to fall and pretty soon
[01:35:26] you'll be on to the next chapter and you can move beyond this bad fantasy chapter that you
[01:35:34] kind of got roped into. I can get you every time if you let them. It's so hard to
[01:35:43] end with so many times you know because when I was a system to a commander a two-in-commander
[01:35:49] task commander what I was doing right but more in the earlier phases right because once I was
[01:35:54] you know a task you're a commander I was dealing with a lot less those those problems that would
[01:35:58] come to me on a relationship level would be something big you know divorce custody of children
[01:36:05] some kind of domestic violent scenario like real things but when I was younger
[01:36:11] and I was in a seal platoon that's when you're dealing with guys going through the breakup with the
[01:36:15] girl and that you know the method with my head man yeah it's messing with my head man yeah of course
[01:36:21] every guy goes through that me you ever that's the way it is you get that weird thing
[01:36:28] kicking around in there and you start getting crazy and what's so fun is what's so funny is
[01:36:35] when you're on the outside of it it's so like when you're in the heart shaped box to yourself
[01:36:40] you just can't see anything else it's just devastating and everyone that's looking at you is like
[01:36:44] bro let's just go to the bargainite you've meet 17 new girls tonight yeah but I've like a back
[01:36:50] guy like that was my girl that was my special girl no it's not I remember I kind of had a this
[01:36:55] is kind of evil but I had a kind of a standard response to guys when they'd say you know
[01:37:03] hey you know I broke up with Jennifer last night I mean oh sweet man let's let's roll I would always
[01:37:09] and I even carried that honestly this is like not something I don't think I would do anymore but
[01:37:13] even when guys who would be like hey man me and Jennifer are getting divorced a bit oh right
[01:37:17] oh bro you're asking that's rockin' roll you know I kind of and part of it was just to kind of
[01:37:22] spin it like guys man it's not that you need you don't just wallowing it right you're getting divorced
[01:37:29] okay here's what you need to do here's how you maneuver but you know what are you going to do
[01:37:33] you're going to get dragged down by that into that mire or you're going to you know salvage
[01:37:38] what you can of your life and let's move on let's rock and roll yeah so that's again it might be a
[01:37:45] little harsh I don't know that would still have that react maybe with maybe false still in the
[01:37:49] dude you know and most and 99 I had one guy that that that in I probably said that to
[01:37:59] we have a height of horse rate in the sealed teams yeah it's like an 85 90% of horse rate so I've
[01:38:04] said this too quite a few individuals over there I only had one that ever kind of you know was
[01:38:10] was like no man you don't get it I said no actually I do get it you don't get it yeah and it always
[01:38:18] is a little rough ruiners kids involved in all that so that would put another little horrible
[01:38:23] spin on it but the bottom line is that is a good attitude to have hey broke up with my girl
[01:38:30] right on I'm glad I got out of this relationship before it developed into something where I did
[01:38:36] have hooks in me yeah financial hooks children yeah all those things I made it out scop free
[01:38:44] you know I'm getting divorced oh you have any kids no okay rock and roll yeah you got kids okay
[01:38:50] well how's it gonna go you know what do you put in line yeah you know I'm so yeah definitely hard
[01:38:57] here's the question have you ever gotten your heart broken the negative you haven't straight up
[01:39:04] even in of course I have broke I was I was a boy boys get their heart broken when went tell me
[01:39:10] oh 10 11 yeah that I'm talking like no I'm 21 ish time because you know when you're 10 it's like
[01:39:21] okay 15 14 17 13 I mean I think once I was I was I see once I was in the sealed teams I kind of
[01:39:28] had that coping mechanism yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:39:36] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah the y'all that's you know the younger days for sure
[01:39:43] every guy goes through that and that's what that's what's hard and you know what I'm saying guys
[01:39:48] specifically but the girls are the same way both guys and girls go through these horrible breakups
[01:39:54] when you and and this is the other thing that we got to realize as parents when you're 16 years old
[01:40:01] we you know I look at my 15 16 17 year old daughters right as they were grown up and and I think oh they
[01:40:08] got a boyfriend whatever he'll be it's this guy is meaningless in their lives I factually know
[01:40:17] that these guys are meaningless in terms of the broad spectrum of their life yeah but guess what when
[01:40:24] you're 15 years old and you got a boyfriend that is your whole life and so when something goes sideways
[01:40:31] I had to say oh I'd remember that myself when I saw my daughters distraught over something I'd
[01:40:36] say okay here's what's going on this is her whole life and I tried to explain to him this
[01:40:40] guy I understand that you like him and that he was good and blah blah blah but you know let's
[01:40:47] remember you're only 15 and there you know you're gonna meet another nice guy and other there'll be
[01:40:53] other opportunities and blah blah blah but of course barely barely gets through to their heads
[01:40:58] yeah hopefully they can't even imagine a nicer guy is different I know because he's the
[01:41:03] bad no and so yeah yeah you're on that question restriction from now on no I'm not
[01:41:14] ready to know I think we all want it to know next question juggle what's your take on false
[01:41:23] motivation versus authentic leadership okay false motivation versus authentic leadership
[01:41:32] and others two kind of two kind of ways of understanding this question the first is from like
[01:41:39] a really heavy leadership perspective and that is of trying to lead without actually believing
[01:41:44] in what you're doing and that's leading without understanding why and not believing in what you're
[01:41:51] doing and that's wrong right and this is an extreme ownership of course and we talk about
[01:41:57] on the podcast you can't do it if you don't believe in what you're doing your team is going to
[01:42:01] see that and they won't believe in it either which means they're not going to go above and
[01:42:04] beyond to accomplish the mission period so you got to believe what you're doing and if you don't
[01:42:09] believe it then you got to ask the question up the chain of command find out why understand why
[01:42:15] so you believe in what you're doing and eventually you're going to get the answer right
[01:42:19] eventually you're going to understand why you're doing something you're going to believe in it
[01:42:25] or you're going to you're going to convince the chain of command that that's not a good method
[01:42:30] then you need to go a different direction and there might be some rare in extremist case where
[01:42:38] you actually don't you know you're I'm being told to do something I don't believe in it
[01:42:43] and I'd say no I'm not going to do it in like Napoleon said Napoleon's maximums if you
[01:42:49] you you actually have to refuse to do it if you don't believe it's the right thing to do then you
[01:42:54] don't do it that should be if very in extremist because or as a leader when we're being
[01:43:00] asked to do something or told to do something or led in a certain way they're leading us towards
[01:43:07] victory right they're leading us towards an aligned victory if it's on the battlefield
[01:43:13] that's winning the war if it's in business it's creating profit and creating a product and
[01:43:18] growing the business right those things are that's what you're trying to do so if echo if
[01:43:24] I'm the boss and you come to me with something and say hey I want to do this
[01:43:28] if it's going to make us more profitable why would I say no right so we're going to move in that
[01:43:34] direction so from a high level false motivation doesn't work if you don't believe in something
[01:43:40] it's not going to work out for you now from a micro level from like a front line level and the
[01:43:49] buds and structures used to joke about this that false motivation is better than no motivation
[01:43:53] have you heard that is that a common expression false motivation is better than no motivation
[01:43:57] and we don't want that to be true right because we want motivation to be this pure golden thing
[01:44:05] that fuels performance but the fact the matter is and of course we talk about all this all the
[01:44:10] time motivation doesn't hold up right motivation doesn't how many motivated people motivated people
[01:44:18] motivated people didn't make it through seal training a ton of them they're all motivated
[01:44:23] you how many of them did it make you training a ton how many motivated people do you see
[01:44:30] that don't accomplish their goals that they have right the world is full full of those people
[01:44:36] there's a ton of those people and that's because motivation doesn't hold you up we all know this it's
[01:44:42] discipline that holds you up it's discipline that gets things going and it's discipline that gets you
[01:44:48] through things but this is an interesting little spin if you have the discipline to press on
[01:44:57] why don't have a little fun with it right and that's what I think false motivation can
[01:45:02] can come in and it can make something fun for instance it's cold wet and miserable and we have to
[01:45:08] go swim over the beach and do an operation let's get some or it's 118 degrees with massive
[01:45:17] humidity and we have a 14 kilometer patrol to get to target let's get some right do yeah
[01:45:27] or the water is 41 degrees and we air about to launch on a four hour dive right hell yes let's do this
[01:45:37] right that that's false motivation but it's backed up by discipline and it might not be real but
[01:45:44] it absolutely beats the hell out of this is could be miserable that I want to do it right what would
[01:45:51] you if you and I were going to go do something that was going to suck would you rather have me say
[01:45:57] echo I really don't want to do this but I'm disciplined to him going to do it oh would you have
[01:46:01] rather have me say echo this is going to suck let's go get some right you rather have the false
[01:46:07] motivation yes sir strap on the pack and put on the mask and fins and fire up the false
[01:46:13] motivation now I will tell you this I wouldn't even be sarcastic with false motivation I won't
[01:46:20] even blink and I actually my this is the difference my my false motivation isn't even false I
[01:46:24] actually believe my own false motivation yeah it's working and by the time stuff came out of my
[01:46:30] mouth I meant it I meant it so I don't know at some point in my childhood false motivation
[01:46:38] turned into like an actual fuel and just just regular motivation maybe it's because I realized
[01:46:44] that I wasn't counting on it to get me through things I was just having fun with it rock and roll
[01:46:50] do you think also how you know how you like you'd always say that you're kind of into just
[01:46:55] being hardcore even if like normal stuff whatever so you know when you think back and you're like okay
[01:47:02] I'm going to take the hard route or whatever after you finish it you kind of feel more proud of it
[01:47:07] first like do you think that that played into it yeah that is like like a me yeah for sure
[01:47:12] for sure be more hardcore yeah like like I said like the meaning of the meaning of the music hard
[01:47:17] core when I was a kid was being hardcore yeah just the actual meaning of the word and so yeah it's
[01:47:23] really easy to go from that to like hey I'm going to do something that sucks and I'm going to have
[01:47:27] a good time with I'm going to laugh about it yeah and that and it is contagious you know so
[01:47:31] contagious I'm actually not like that now and if we're just saying you're going to like that I'm actually
[01:47:37] like that now okay not to you know 100% but in a lot of things man like my um my daughter she's
[01:47:44] four she weighs 45 47 pounds so I'll be sitting or I'll be laying on the couch not paying
[01:47:53] attention she'll climb up on the couch behind and jump in land like you know what a knee drop is right
[01:47:58] yeah atomic knee drop yeah for a while just so you know for a while in my house there was no rules
[01:48:04] in my house no actually there was no there was only two rules in my house when my kids were like
[01:48:10] when my older kids were like you know seven six whatever that those types of ages that your
[01:48:16] daughters out right now but a little bit older there was two rules in my house number one don't touch
[01:48:21] me when I'm eating number two no atomic knee drops they would do it to each other oh yeah I
[01:48:29] didn't mind them doing it to me but they would atomic knee drop each other yeah so I had to have two
[01:48:33] rules and plus I would never a lot of time to eat and all of a sudden it's like they want to hold
[01:48:39] on my arm no no no no no you're wasting you when I'm eating like a rabbit dog and it's funny one
[01:48:45] of them the reason that's fresh in my mind because we were just on a trip and you know my
[01:48:50] kids were explaining to my youngest daughter that well you know when we were little dad was
[01:48:55] meaner and he wouldn't let us touch him when he was eating like you just did and of course I said well
[01:49:03] that's because she's cute or than you are all of you I don't mind the atomic knee drops anymore
[01:49:13] because of you because of the various things like you got to be hardcore it's because of like
[01:49:17] okay you got four year old kid yeah right so I think I have fun that is for her to
[01:49:21] I talk to you drop you yeah which is the other reason why I'm like this now so she'll
[01:49:25] climb on the couch atomic knee drop while I'm not ready by the way yeah my to my ribs so
[01:49:30] she didn't break my ribs she didn't injure me to any blasting degree but if the normal
[01:49:36] mindset is like why did you jump what did you do that it hurt yeah it's face it 45 47 pounds
[01:49:43] top of a couch atomic knee drop both knees by the way all the way you know the last city all that stuff
[01:49:50] hurt by the normal standard of things so the typical mindset I think would be like
[01:49:56] don't do that especially the shock and all this stuff but default is just like whatever you
[01:50:02] factor yeah yeah yeah sure it is a catch-to-one too because she will and does and but she thinks
[01:50:08] it's all fun and all this stuff but yeah that's that mindset and that you came directly from you
[01:50:12] like be like it's like juggle wouldn't complain about that right there oh you won't let that happen
[01:50:16] yeah it's really embarrassing if you complain to your four year old dog you hurt about anything you
[01:50:20] hurt about anything yeah about anything yeah about anything that's that's that's the setting example
[01:50:24] you're talking about earlier yeah you complain about anything and you're wrong agree that's so just suck it
[01:50:30] up yeah say bring it on false motivation which becomes real motivation which for the only the like I
[01:50:38] said the only sort of reason for motivation for me is just funny just funny it's not going to
[01:50:46] actually get you to do anything but just let's have fun I'm going to do it anyways I'm going to
[01:50:51] let the atomic knee drops happen over and over again I'm going to and so why when I could go through
[01:50:55] life just experiencing them and accepting them why not have some fun with the atomic knee drops
[01:51:00] a long cold dives and those hot weather and the you know dehydration and the my profile why not have
[01:51:06] fun with all those things yeah and I mean you probably know but it's unbelievable how much that
[01:51:11] helps you know what I think maybe because my view of motivation is so low yeah that to me it's just funny
[01:51:21] like false motivation like just funny yeah and and it but it is fun yeah it's a fun thing
[01:51:27] yeah that's all and that's kind of part of what I mean case so that you know the the mats I don't know if
[01:51:32] you noticed I brought the mats in there so those mats there I think just like 16 of them
[01:51:37] I forget how many but they cover a two full two car garage cover is it perfect it's a lot of
[01:51:42] mats and the two inch thick ones so to move them you know up you know the topography is that even
[01:51:50] so you had so you had like some legit challenge yeah yeah I'm not even saying that here's not
[01:51:56] enough here here this is what happened so I came in put the mats right there boom one day I
[01:52:02] don't know whenever the other day and then you know I walked the jay's office or brother you
[01:52:07] know he was like oh hey what what are you doing there I was like oh I just put the mats in here he's like
[01:52:11] you put the mats in here what do you you what did someone help you with that I looked at
[01:52:16] I mean I said I don't need help but it was a joke because that's a line from this thing but um
[01:52:22] but the point there is just that that attitude you know like no I don't need help no I don't you
[01:52:29] know because I'm trying to be like jockel you know fucking hard core I don't need help little kids
[01:52:34] can hurt me they can make me complete you know it's like that mindset but it's that is
[01:52:39] change you're certainly into a complete savage but little kids can't hurt you and you can carry
[01:52:43] the mats by your own yeah and you know that's another thing that's another little expression I
[01:52:48] just because my son when he was could before he could talk well he would you know he would
[01:52:52] want to do something he'd say let me say I do it by my own right I started by myself or on my own
[01:52:59] yeah mixed up by my own so that became a thing here's a legitimate one that that just changed it
[01:53:10] changed the specific thing where you know how I'd like I'd be the kind of fighting getting
[01:53:15] enough sleep I just I'd let it ruin me so if I didn't have something specific like um
[01:53:24] uh important to do so just throughout the day I'm tired you know whatever so now I never admit
[01:53:30] that I'm tired yeah that's a good great starting place yeah I've explained myself I've explained
[01:53:35] not to my son is is you just don't admit ever that don't let those words come out of your mouth
[01:53:40] yeah I'm tired I'm sore I'm whatever just stop you get in the teams you that's just that's just
[01:53:45] a putting up a red flag of being a complete pans don't do it don't do it as matter fact
[01:53:52] you know what's jacked up is like I won't even let's say you and I would go out let's say
[01:53:56] was wintertime and you and I would go out and I had a sweatshirt with me because I knew it
[01:54:01] might get cold but what I would already and I have the sweatshirt in my hand I won't even
[01:54:06] put it on you can't put it on yeah because then you then you might say like were you cold
[01:54:12] I'm cold I need some more yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:54:17] yeah I'm gonna do that too or I should have said not do that yeah proud I don't remember the time
[01:54:21] remember so I pick a told this story before remember time we're driving from L.A. it was like late at night
[01:54:27] and you're like yeah I know I'm this big bad team guy or whatever but I'm kind of tired right now
[01:54:32] and then almost like you just it was painful to let the words out of your mouth you know like you let
[01:54:38] them slip in it really hurt you so it was like maybe like three seconds later you said
[01:54:43] fuck it I'll just drive them on tanner if I have to right now I'll just get in the mud
[01:54:48] I don't want to see you guys but I was tired yeah I was driving and my wife says like
[01:54:54] are you you haven't been sleeping much are you okay to drive I was like yeah
[01:54:58] and I actually did the same thing I was kind of like well I'm super tired I can drive indefinitely
[01:55:05] I don't know though I mean you I don't know maybe you're different maybe not but that's the
[01:55:10] actually no I don't encourage people doing that yeah don't encourage it that's a that's a horrible
[01:55:14] thing to do is drive when you're super tired yeah yeah don't do that but I'm quiet it's
[01:55:20] it's having to be for but I'm quiet it's really boring to drive because so easy it's just so like you
[01:55:25] don't so when you get like tired or sleepy whatever it's really easy to just fall asleep super easy
[01:55:32] and that's hard because you can't control it it's like you think you can just I can control it
[01:55:37] and sure there is little tactics like you can like hard to do little things that you know
[01:55:41] and like paint on yourself whatever but man it's really hard to control it once you fall asleep
[01:55:45] yeah no don't do that don't do that you wake up in a bridge in the bunkman just yeah
[01:55:52] dead or wake up dead yeah yeah it's my good the I was reading this thing on motivation
[01:55:58] and it said in this book I'm not saying that this true or not true but it said it made sense
[01:56:04] where motivation people misuse word motivation and they confuse it with inspiration so
[01:56:10] inspiration is like when someone gets y'all revved up to do something right so you're saying like
[01:56:14] what you know let's do this or you see a mansion now you're inspired to work hard for stuff
[01:56:18] whatever listen to some speech some quote unquote motivational speech it inspires it doesn't
[01:56:24] motivate you motivation is your your bare raw motive the motive for you doing it so let's say
[01:56:31] I feel like I said this before but the let's say I want to get in shape you know girls will
[01:56:36] get in shape for their wedding you know that's the motive is to be in shape for the wedding
[01:56:40] okay so that doesn't go away so she's not necessarily inspired meaning she's like um she
[01:56:45] got infused with some healing you know you just find motivation wouldn't go away but it would
[01:56:52] well it's no here's the moment we get there is discipline yeah yeah yeah yeah because the
[01:56:56] motivation she wakes up at five o'clock in the morning you go get a workout in where she goes to work
[01:57:01] it's really easy to just be like you know what I'm not feeling motivated today right right
[01:57:05] I'll just get the get the wedding dress you know let out a little bit yeah but that just
[01:57:11] means that the motive motivation the motive isn't strong enough to overcome her feelings
[01:57:17] that's right don't rely on it yeah you're not gonna find a motivation that's strong enough
[01:57:21] to make you do the things that you have to do all the time you don't you can't does an
[01:57:24] exact kind of well it depends it just depends so consider a fighter stop consider a fighter
[01:57:29] with a fight he has to make way bro yeah you're right guys don't make a fight I don't make
[01:57:34] wait I'm saying that's what I'm saying though the motive and you know what you're not
[01:57:37] with that you know in that motivation failed that motivation failed you know five weeks ago
[01:57:42] when they when they five guys burgers yeah they had a five-guards burgers yeah you're right
[01:57:47] so this one holds a line yeah it does totally now you can have fun with it and you can be
[01:57:52] motivated to have discipline and you can say oh like Pete Robbins from origin geese I was up
[01:58:00] with him in Maine and he's like got a bet to lose weight and he hit me with some false
[01:58:06] motivation because we were out we were out and you know we were in order I was ordered
[01:58:11] big steak and just getting after the grub and I said like how many more pounds do you
[01:58:16] have you know we're talking about as I get a kind of soccer situation he's like no I
[01:58:19] actually enjoy watching you eat delicious food you know you go to false motivation
[01:58:23] coming out but in a funny way yeah and instead letting it out like that instead of being just
[01:58:29] miserable why not just have some fun with it yeah yeah that's my advice yeah fully but then the
[01:58:35] difference though like I said I agree you're right I mean the point I was maybe making was uh
[01:58:43] was just the technical difference between motivation and inspiration you know how it's a
[01:58:48] can we not talk about that you would it be you know because both those words just don't
[01:58:53] get a much for me there's flimsy the week yeah the week words and the week and the and the actual
[01:58:59] subjects are weak inspiration all right the vacation like it's not gonna get you there come on
[01:59:07] it might get you through like the first three minutes of a you know you and I were just talking
[01:59:12] before you came in here you said there was moments in your workout today when you put it easily
[01:59:17] or yesterday you could have easily called it okay I mean I'm sweating I got a good workout but
[01:59:21] you didn't you have the wine this one discipline it was actually I created false one it just
[01:59:28] truth be told you right but I've created false motivation for myself I said you know what I'm
[01:59:35] gonna I'm gonna do this actually it's the way for me to facilitate discipline for myself is I want
[01:59:40] to do this because I'm gonna feel better afterwards you know that whole deal you're talking about
[01:59:44] discipline then you contrast it with how junk I'm gonna feel if I don't weak embarrassed for myself
[01:59:50] by the way and when I said that you know how workout has many opportunities to stop yeah so one
[01:59:56] the first opportunity is in the parking lot in this case I went to a gym so bro if you walk away
[02:00:00] when you're in the parking lot you got issues so I've done that I've done that like four times
[02:00:04] and then I did admit that on the podcast you should just lie
[02:00:08] I'm the left what makes this current story okay more significant so boom that's the first opportunity
[02:00:14] second opportunity is before you warm up which is pretty close to the first opportunity before you
[02:00:19] warm up you ever quit then yes oh my god twice one time it felt real good because I justified it
[02:00:26] very effectively in the second time I was like I just got to get after it tomorrow whatever nonetheless
[02:00:30] then then it's after the first body part or the first sort of you know you have I'm gonna do you know
[02:00:36] Macon first I'm gonna do spots first so you know it's after the first exercise the body part really yeah
[02:00:43] yeah okay that's one opportunity like to me the biggest hurdles getting there which is when you
[02:00:47] have your Jimmy or house that's that turtle's gone I agree that it gets easier to hold the line for
[02:00:53] sure after you start but there's a part at the end you know how like how you just said you like to do your
[02:00:59] magnet like afterwards no lately I've been doing Macon before and lifting heavy after right
[02:01:05] yeah that's what I'm sure but you're right I could say you know what that Macon was a little bit heavy
[02:01:09] yeah we were just calling good on the heavy part yeah exactly right and I feel so good when I'm
[02:01:15] all loosened up yeah so I'm same deal with me and I you know every opportunity to quit
[02:01:23] was passed was we've well done echo Charlie yeah that's a question yeah I got time for one more yes
[02:01:31] juggle I am a chronic excuse maker how do I stop making excuses this is actually pretty simple
[02:01:53] and I said at the other day and you have to realize you have to know you have to accept
[02:02:01] that all your excuses or lies they are lies all of them think about the things
[02:02:12] that you tell yourself the lies you use to rationalize taking the easy road
[02:02:17] taking the easy road and leaving discipline behind think about them you don't have time
[02:02:30] that's a lie you don't have support that's a lie you don't have the equipment or the gear
[02:02:42] lies you don't you don't know the best way who cares that's a lie or you're too old or you're
[02:02:53] too young of course you're too old or too young lie and there's you're too busy sure you are
[02:03:04] that's a lie and you're too tired or you're too sore or you're just plain not feeling it
[02:03:15] lies lies lies and the list goes on and on and on and it doesn't stop if you don't make it stop
[02:03:30] so recognize recognize the excuses are not valid they are they are trumped up they're conjured up
[02:03:49] they're fabricated they're lies and how do you stop the lies you stop the lies with the truth
[02:03:55] the truth the truth will set you free the truth will stand and the truth will deliver you from
[02:04:09] procrastination and laziness and the downward spiral that comes with a lack of discipline
[02:04:17] so don't believe the lies believe the truth and the truth is you have time you have the skill
[02:04:28] you have the knowledge and the support and the will power and the discipline to get it done
[02:04:35] so cast out the lies burn them down and listen to the truth and live the truth and go out and get it done
[02:04:56] and I think that's all I've got for tonight so echo you know speaking of the truth
[02:05:13] could you perhaps explain to us how to support this podcast if we want to if we want to
[02:05:22] share what you can do is support yourself I think I made this analogy before you know in the
[02:05:31] aircraft right pre take off they go through the safety instructions in the event of cabin pressure
[02:05:38] loss yeah oxygen tank mask comes down put on yourself before you can all that I mean that's a good
[02:05:44] kind of thing where you support yourself then you can help support others so support yourself
[02:05:49] this is how with supplementation like it and again I'll say this again I'll say it every day if I
[02:05:55] am compelled if I motivated to inspire you the way I'm now into supplements not a bunch but before
[02:06:06] I was like no supplements you just get good nutrition anyway so real oil and I think this is a
[02:06:14] daily thing by the way and I think you can maybe relate I think daily on how happy I am that I take
[02:06:22] cruel oil and it's I don't like thank my lucky star nothing like that I'm just saying there are
[02:06:27] daily things that it's on my mind that I'm like this experience would be different if I did not take
[02:06:33] cruel oil straight up that is true so I got a so I back my car into the garage loading mats
[02:06:42] the oh yeah that that was another time but this was more recently so it's getting filling you know
[02:06:47] you fill up the five gallon things a water yeah and I talk about that so I'm putting like you
[02:06:52] got a maneuver it because I said in the garage I should have pulled out but whatever
[02:06:56] maneuvering a hard core man big times so I'm maneuvering got to take it out and I don't want to
[02:07:01] you know so you you start to explain but you know when you're in big space
[02:07:04] whatever but everyone's true it's applicable everyday life the cruel oil isn't just for
[02:07:12] deep squats heavy it's for taking five gallons of water in a jug out of tight spaces where you
[02:07:20] got a kind of twist you know yeah because you don't want the car door to hit like the other
[02:07:23] car door to dent it good time to have the cruel oil in you yeah man and really that's well
[02:07:28] that's part of the payoff is what big part is the everyday things
[02:07:32] true for sure yeah there'd be times where I would be sitting down a long time and I stand up
[02:07:38] and I'm surprised on how little pain I feel not pain you know what I'm saying yeah but you
[02:07:44] have been like that where you think like yes I'm gonna feel like oh this this is gonna be
[02:07:48] stiff or this is gonna be heard of what I and it's just simply not yeah yeah yeah that part is real
[02:07:54] so get your cruel oil in the event of you even wanting cruel oil these are my experiences
[02:07:59] obviously joc was this wokas you take cruel oil as well indeed um get them from on it on it
[02:08:05] dot com slash jockel if you want the 10% off also the alpha brain so the cruel oil that's like
[02:08:11] I don't think that'll ever go away no the alpha brain I am using a lot more
[02:08:19] I'm reading more to coincidence maybe maybe not one might be causing the other correlation may not be
[02:08:24] causation but I'm just saying that is happening and I will admit this as far as work out
[02:08:33] skull I'm getting real into the kettlebells you've always been into the gas yeah not always but you know
[02:08:40] 15 yeah yeah no I would say like maybe 10 years or something 12 years yeah maybe it has been
[02:08:49] 15 years yeah because I just remember that picture jolrogant I think jolrogant and I were talking
[02:08:53] about the picture of fadore yeah yeah look that out right when you guys are yeah fadore with the
[02:08:58] pictures that with him it all it was okay cool yeah yeah yeah so I was kind of hard to get a magnet though
[02:09:04] yeah well yeah so I think it was jolrogant saying how like somebody introduced them to
[02:09:09] America and that's that's what's the machine guy yeah and they're they're really good um again
[02:09:14] being careful every single moment but I'm to the point right now where like you know you get
[02:09:19] kind of good any gets even fun or like anything and then I'm like oh let me get that heavier one
[02:09:23] no I want to get to heavier one but I will say this about the kettlebells about my experience I
[02:09:29] started off the kettlebells getting these these designer ones you know primal bells on it zombie bells
[02:09:36] probably actually didn't get the zombie I got primal and then the legend where wolf ones anyway
[02:09:43] they're cool right cool to look at so you know who I'm kind of like who I don't know if I should
[02:09:48] be proud of this or shame to this but I'm like the kid the you know the teenager gets their
[02:09:52] driver's license and the two types of kids there's the one kid who the dad's like hey you got
[02:09:58] to learn to walk before you can fly so you got to like I don't know I'll make the down payment you
[02:10:02] make the payments that's what my dad just said or you make the down payment or whatever you know like
[02:10:06] you got to work for this first car and it might not be the you know the BMW whatever
[02:10:12] then there's the other kid who rolls right into the BMW you know hey good job you're 50 now big
[02:10:17] big big time of your life time in your life whatever here's a dope car congratulations love you son
[02:10:25] you know then there's that guy that's kind of who I am with the kettlebells you know I didn't like
[02:10:29] pay my dues you know when the kettlebells were new and all the way to it yeah yeah yeah
[02:10:36] the dope kettlebell where wolf yeah anyway a lot of cool stuff on there on it dot com a lot of cool
[02:10:43] stuff on there um all legit stuff that's I think the real compelling thing for me anyway
[02:10:48] is because I know these supplements man they're whack I've heard of people getting their
[02:10:53] supplements and then you know the supplement was like contaminated with something and then they say
[02:10:58] oh yeah they just mix all the supplements in the same thing and the fact it's like it can be really
[02:11:02] whack nonetheless on it that's the good ones quality so yeah if you want 10% off on it dot com slash
[02:11:10] juggle strong bones are going to be for your 10 it's in my experience also amazon so where do we
[02:11:19] get these books sure we didn't do books today but we do what what 66% of the time would you say probably
[02:11:25] some books yeah maybe more sometimes more than one book yeah last time we did three books three books
[02:11:29] boom all on the website by the way yep so you know if you this is another support yourself
[02:11:34] situation a lot of times people ask aid you know where which book was that again you know and they
[02:11:38] gotta go back where you don't you go ask for me for reading list hey do you have some kind of
[02:11:41] reading list I'm like yes I got a reading list it's on soccer podcast dot com every book that I
[02:11:46] end and by the way are there books that are there good books that you've read that that you
[02:11:50] haven't put on the podcast not really when I read a book and it's good it's going on the podcast yeah
[02:11:55] if I read a book and it's lame it's not going on the podcast now there's some books that are
[02:11:59] informational but they don't cut it for the podcast you know I wouldn't recommend them I'll tell you a
[02:12:05] little bit a little I just realized this I had a book selected for the podcast like three weeks ago
[02:12:12] and I got a hundred pages into it it didn't cut the mustard for the podcast yeah and I'll tell you
[02:12:17] that one of the major reasons for those of you that recommend me books a lot one of the major
[02:12:22] reasons that it didn't cut the mustard for the podcast is not only was it not a first person account
[02:12:27] but it didn't even have like a lot of excerpts of first person accounts it was just factually
[02:12:35] this is what happened this is what happened this is what happened it was very well detailed it's a good
[02:12:38] book but it wasn't podcast because if you if you want to do that if we're just going to read facts
[02:12:45] dates facts elements maneuvering that's that's you could just listen to the audio book right
[02:12:53] yeah just for or just go look on Wikipedia and it's going to tell you the dates and times and
[02:12:58] where it units maneuvered and who on the battle and how many people casualties they were right all that
[02:13:02] stuff's in yeah we don't want just that I want to hear what the people were thinking I want to hear
[02:13:06] they're from the human beings yep so even though there's people send me books if you're going to send
[02:13:11] me a book look for the first person account if it's not a first person account like machete
[02:13:15] season that's not a first person account but it it interviews the killers yeah so you're hearing the
[02:13:20] first person accounts yeah and that reading list so that reading list is pretty pretty well
[02:13:28] vetted that like straight up if it doesn't pass the jocco approval of recommendation it's not going
[02:13:33] on the podcast not going on the podcast and then they're for you know no I'd rather not do a podcast
[02:13:39] than put a lame book on the podcast not happening boom and that's the standard right there so
[02:13:43] joccopodcast.com top menu little things says books from the podcast all of them right in a bit
[02:13:51] later yep and what I'm kind of starting to do is like let's say you know how I like I mentioned that book
[02:13:57] mine is called mine game just small little book I think you did you put it on there yeah
[02:14:01] somebody somebody tweeted I didn't know you put it on there yeah so I'll put that kind of if
[02:14:05] if you're if we mention a cool book and let's say you for what let's say it doesn't fit or you
[02:14:09] didn't get to it or whatever but there's some sort of a for lack of a better term buzz going around
[02:14:14] it yeah put it on there nonetheless point there is get the books from there click through there
[02:14:21] that's a good way to support swanxian figure action and if you're just gonna just
[02:14:25] shop for duct tape and other you know stuff that you need to do that too like do the website
[02:14:30] double support double support yes dang still one action one big reaction you understand what I'm
[02:14:38] saying also subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stature, Google Play and other podcast providing platforms
[02:14:49] that's a good way to support of course and also YouTube some excerpts on there when yesterday today
[02:14:56] yeah yesterday so those are even and I knew this before but those are getting more and more
[02:15:02] in my opinion significantly valuable because even I you know I don't memorize every word of every
[02:15:10] podcast but when I go through and I kind of look at it and you know and then you you know I listen
[02:15:14] to it listen to the three minutes or whatever it's like a good little reminder it's like a refresher
[02:15:19] and that's not to mention let's say if I totally forgot it you know yeah that's like all and not
[02:15:23] to mention if you hear it and you go that reminds me of Bill he's having that issue gonna send it
[02:15:30] over to Bill no problem shareable yep and he's gonna he's gonna probably watch it as opposed to hey
[02:15:35] Bill here's here's the podcast I was talking about with your issue it's he's 27 minutes long get some
[02:15:42] excuse right Bill might not listen to that quite yet he might get around to it might not not if he's in
[02:15:49] her not if he has a busy life still might find a way anyway but they are shareable and they're
[02:15:56] quicker so you when you click I you can listen to them there excerpts including those and
[02:16:02] also other videos I'm gonna put on there but you know we're working on those so yeah YouTube
[02:16:06] subscribe get some as they say also jacco as a store it's called jacco store jacco store dot com that's
[02:16:14] the website it's an online store it's good one just did a little revamping a bit a little bit more
[02:16:20] user friendly not that it wasn't user friendly before but you know you can I don't know I think
[02:16:27] it's a little cleaner whatever but you know nonetheless the the shirts are still available there
[02:16:33] if you like the shirts you like the designs get some I'm not saying just hey guys support by buying
[02:16:40] shirts I'm not saying that not saying that at all I'm saying go to the website jacco store dot com
[02:16:47] check them out if you like them get them support that way that's all also some try
[02:16:53] go travel mugs on there some bumper stickers there's hoodies but should we be wearing hoodies right now
[02:17:02] well we shouldn't hear yeah we live in California Southern California some people live in
[02:17:09] cold places like where alaska oh yeah yeah that's true my or way yeah that's true also rash guards on
[02:17:21] there though so is it too soon to have another rash guard it's too soon huh I don't really necessarily
[02:17:28] think so yeah I actually think more rash guards is better is better than more the better yeah
[02:17:33] well hey we got two out so there's you know rash guards on there as well some women stuff and um
[02:17:40] yeah if you want to support that way get yourself a garment there's a sick rash guard
[02:17:46] the sick rash guard for like I said I've been hanging out a little bit with a guy named Pete Roberts
[02:17:52] from origin geese up in Maine yeah my home of record for the military by the way doing lint
[02:17:59] and he made a he made a rash guard like a special fourth July day rash guard
[02:18:06] and I'm gonna go ahead and say affirmative it's out of control you got to check it out it is
[02:18:15] George Washington wearing a ghee riding a snake a giant snake the don't tread on me snake
[02:18:26] yeah so it's I don't know if he's gonna make a lot of them but if you don't have one
[02:18:32] I think we all should basically have one origin main dot com you can get one of those origin
[02:18:39] origin main m a i an e origin main dot com and what you know where you know where they're made
[02:18:46] want you guess where they're made well you figure main no you figure oh well he's if he's
[02:18:52] he's getting a rash guard they probably made in china maybe or maybe they're made in Pakistan
[02:18:58] maybe or maybe they're made in Taiwan but there's also a whole bunch places that make them like
[02:19:04] Sri Lanka and Vietnam and Thailand maybe they're made there you'd be wrong on every single of those because you know
[02:19:10] where they're made America they're made in Maine yeah so you might want to order one but do they
[02:19:18] source like the material everything it's from me it's from America pizza crazy pizza doesn't play around
[02:19:27] specially woven he's woven his he weaves his own material four geese to make geese with
[02:19:38] yeah that's straight a main that's straight no that's this made the cotton comes from
[02:19:43] South Carolina or something yeah shipped up to Maine looms you know what I mean no one will
[02:19:49] be a fruit of the loom so it's like here and here's how I put it together ultimately so loom
[02:19:55] it makes you know we've stuck right a little it's a basically a big weaving machine yeah I mean
[02:20:00] this one doesn't that of course so now remember the brand fruit of the loom yeah oh I guess that's
[02:20:05] the fruit of the loom well origin actually has their own looms once again here in Maine
[02:20:15] in your hometown layers bro yeah anyways check those out yeah and you'll you'll be
[02:20:24] to say you'll be fired up I'm gonna go ahead and say you will be inspired and it's funny too because the
[02:20:29] the the rash card design the American the fourth-inch of the rash card design it's you know
[02:20:36] things can get so over the top that they actually become cool yeah yeah that's where it's at
[02:20:43] yeah that's where it's at like me I'm all about the subtle designs right you know oh yeah
[02:20:48] what what should we do make a black yeah and then don't put much on it that's me he's like
[02:20:53] took the other direction I'm gonna have a giant snake I'm gonna have George Washington with a black
[02:20:58] belt on in an origingie I'm gonna have you know that's what I'm talking about yeah America
[02:21:06] that's kind of like on kawai when you go to the North Shore and you can go North North North or you
[02:21:11] can go west west west and you go too far because kawai is like a circle before you know it you're
[02:21:16] essentially at the same place whoa yeah that yeah see oh my god yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I first
[02:21:23] I wasn't following you yes you do get to the same place yeah so you went he went too crazy he went
[02:21:28] too crazy but he went so far in the world in the realm of crazy that it became dope you know because
[02:21:33] you have like we we consider dope is like the perfect mix of crazy and understated in a current
[02:21:40] contemporary or rebellion against yeah but he went in that one direction that you don't really
[02:21:47] go for you know mass acceptance and then he took a two-fuck and now it's right into
[02:21:52] the right where it needs to be. dopeness. it's like a logical warfare hey here's a question
[02:22:02] tough question psychological warfare is this false motivation?
[02:22:08] wait let me explain what it is because psychological warfare is an album with tracks of
[02:22:13] jocco sane basically you know in moments of weakness on your journey whatever we can up early
[02:22:20] sticking to the diet you know we're trying to get stuff done you know anti procrastination stuff
[02:22:27] you can play these tracks and jocco will tell you how to get over that weakness for that moment
[02:22:34] so the question is is that false motivation?
[02:22:39] because you did mention that you can use the false motivation yeah well maybe you are at that point
[02:22:43] right it is possible you just can't depend on it you can't be like hey this this is
[02:22:48] my whole thing yeah that's a good point it's going to get you there but if you're not
[02:22:52] disciplined yourself those tracks are going to do anything for you right yeah exactly so why
[02:22:57] okay these might be our pretty good yeah every powerful but it was like I was saying
[02:23:02] and then we got to make psychological warfare too I've I've got to continue gather a couple more
[02:23:07] tracks that I'm thinking about and what people been asking for so that they can you know have a little
[02:23:13] little spot if they need a spot psychologically spot yeah so just you know what I was thinking of
[02:23:19] naming spiked psychological warfare too what psychological warfare too
[02:23:25] oh hey advanced for advanced but yeah that is what it is it's a spot so just like false
[02:23:32] motivation that can be just like a spot like you can't roll into the gym with your workout
[02:23:36] partner and be like hey I'm gonna get under this bench it's four or five on there I want you to
[02:23:41] do the whole thing I want you to upright row yeah that you know yeah you don't that's not what
[02:23:45] a spot's for it's not what any of these things for it's I'm gonna do this in the unlikely event
[02:23:52] that I run into something that might cause me to fail you got me that rest of the way that's it
[02:23:59] so psychological warfare is too by the way but in my experience and opinion you can lean on that
[02:24:04] pretty heavily it'll get you through it's my opinion also jocquite on amazon you can get that there
[02:24:15] and I guess I got asked on twitter if I ever used any performance enhancing drugs no and I said
[02:24:21] no but honestly let's just go ahead and face it um white tea is kind of the king of performance enhancement
[02:24:30] as far as I've seen so obviously it's the only substance on the market that is guaranteed to
[02:24:39] add 7,554 pounds to your deadlift so is that performance enhancing? probably luckily it's not
[02:24:50] being tested for right now you know by the US DSA S P yeah them so you'd soon it's all right now you can get it
[02:25:00] yeah get it you can just get that massive increase and everything that you do that's cool also
[02:25:05] way the warrior kid and man so many people have been posting pictures of kids doing pull ups and
[02:25:17] kids pulling tires and kids studying flashcards and kids making their own warrior kid codes
[02:25:23] and memorizing the presidents and it's honestly it's awesome to see kids in their first due to
[02:25:30] class it's so good to see so thanks everyone that is posted that and and shown what's going on

[02:26:50] overcome setbacks everything it's all in there and I'll tell you it's not a normal book this is not a
[02:26:56] normal book in any stretch my publisher says he's never seen the book anything close to this it's
