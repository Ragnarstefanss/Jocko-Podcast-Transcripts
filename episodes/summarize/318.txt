you know because like I said I became like a historian I read every book everything every there's probably not a book on the teams that I didn't read and this was before like a lot of books were coming out they're like old school books and I really believe like in the brotherhood like in the old school like do everything together kind of mentality uh matter if I could be herel he's like an old school team guy uh and he was like I never forget we're like sent drinking beer one down as a new guy and he's like he's like you and you know the other guys like you guys are like the spirit of like the old teams like the old teams like just I was always a good shooter I don't not that I grew up like you know you're hunting like like I always laugh because now I'm like big archery hunter and stuff and and actually a hunter but we're in high growth like hunting was like you know shooting out of the back of a truck and like you're like an accord field and like you know like that was hunting like you know like our hunting gear was like you know like one of these snow suit like you bought a wall crack and they were telling me about what happened to a bunch of our guys I mean helping us the walls shishkabab spears stuff through their hearts you know I mean like brutally killed so it was uh it was tough uh a good relationship with those guys so some of them are here in the states actually funny enough like what I'm like I don't know they don't we don't use our names but one of the guys somehow like found me and like reached out to like my secretary like I was like my name is like someone's so my homied like you know looking for Mike and they said it to me I'm like take everything off the internet I could remember being so hungry, like, going in the grocery store and just then like, just like grabbing like food and just like seeing like the big fat security guy, like just looking at me like, and I would do the whole, like kind of like Julio Jones like, you know, and you just, I'd make it out with like one tent of what I had. hey I know like what's going on like or you know what I was your trip like next thing I know I'm like literally like dudes with orange vest walking around looking for me with like rubber shape like laying the bushes like I was so mad I can't describe how mad I was the only thing I could do was think about how mad I was I was being possible from a getting mad or like I would explode so I go through you know I go through that I hurt my hand and and and up rolling out of that bulltune right before the tasking I got a pretty severe arterial injury in my hand so I started boxing with him on the weekends like smart partner getting them in shape and so you know I grew up watching Ray Mercer you know he devastated town in Morris and he lost the landing slow as he was a brutal dude he never been knocked down he had a head like a you know like a giant block of cheese and he was merciless I mean if you watch that knockout against Tim Morrison who was like my hero at the time before he got AIDS and but like I mean when he beat him down I remember he said he's like you can kill somebody in boxing he that's like all he said it was like very like that and I had like I don't like I got like guys like I like the prepatabors like you need help you know like it raises over like I'm like I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I'm like and I'm like underwater like like hand signal so I wouldn't change it for anything in the world because of the team I got to be a part of what we got to do and the knowledge that I gained of that mobility platform it was something that I think like within the teams is so like niche and most people think you know because the STV guys always get like bad rap you know like golf freaking like a STV guys like I mean I'm with ranchers I'm in rural I'm in agriculture people that's my life and you you listen to these old guys kneel down and pick up the soil dead right and where's all this stuff going where's all these things going what's happening around us is that people only care about their own projections and the very things that give them life they're destroying to further something that does only exist fictitiously as an idea and it's a scary time to be living in right now it's like you know here we are like Ukraine like Russia like look out like wow like they're coming they're gonna get us all like their actions and and it's like it's like something I feel like when I showed up at buzz it was like I felt really inferior to everybody like in the sense that everyone I was like ripped and like they were like all like you know played football and everybody was like sports athletes and everyone there but there are those things like that really matter in life are are your food your water your shelter in your relationships in your life and um if you're not in balance with those things there's nothing there's no things in life that are gonna help you find a place of completion because eventually you will face the man in the mirror you will eventually no matter what you know matter how many cart no matter what it is like I was using example of like warm buff it was like laying in the desert and dying like about to die and I came like walking by with some water and I was like hey weren't get me all the money that you have and I'll give you this water you would take it he would 100% take it he wouldn't be like and now I'm kind of figuring I'm in a total state of paranoia too because every move I ever watched about the CIA is like playing in my head you know I like turned the sink out of me for like a cable to come out like look at me and write everything like everything everybody is like everybody's on it which is kind of funny because what I went through this surveillance course and I actually got busted by like a big fat lady in a KFC she like busted me or you know any pretty much anyone's story and you hear those cool little parts of it where it's like oh man I need to take away the computer from my kids from now on you know it's like you get sucked into a story so much like it's so um what do you call like so engaging that you kind of like I kind of want to be a bohunter now you know it's like that kind of a woman given john that lea call I'm saying it when he's talking I'm like so I've just dedicated my life to you know right now the program is a 41 day long program you know at the end of it we have a Lakota sweat lodge I've had the opportunity to get to know some of those medicine men and you know that's an ancient tradition that is 16,000 years old that dates back and you know they say you go into the womb of the earth and when you come out you know you're reborn and it's it's really like it's like an insane sauna that has chanting and all those other kinds of things and you you're in there in the heat and you kind of go the heat brings you from the kind of physical into the spiritual and so every guy will pass through those windows and they'll do a four window ceremony upon graduation and then and then people are like and then what and I'm like and then go and live your life because now you know and if you want to go participate in those same things you can do it but not ignorantly because you know you know that yeah it's like sorry for the doing gloom you know believe me you listen to this podcast little bit more we got to do we got to play there is like there is like an IT for he's like a machete like I get the the weird thing is is as you look at this stuff in a large scale all these things are in place you know when you just were saying that about vets you're on a bunch of medications and you're being basically subdued you know you're being subdued and it's not just vets it's like humans humans are being subdued look we don't really actually want you to do anything we don't actually want you to come up with your own ideas we don't actually want you to write your own freaking books we don't want you to create something what we want you to do is continue to feed our machine that we've got work and over here that's what we want we want to feed our machine so it was like at first like not what I had like signed up to do like meanwhile I'm like watching the news you know it's like like let's go like break and I think we need to restore what it means to be an American like I think we've lost I think that term is synonymous with the wrong things and and being a patriotists synonymous with the wrong things you think patriotic like dude riding a jacked upside by side like woo like oh like freedom like no there is no freedom there's only free and that's what America freedom means that someone's affording me that to me free is an alienable right is is to live like as I see fit and fulfill my purpose and this nation affords me that and in turn I serve you know my country that gives me the opportunity and provides all this infrastructure and all those kinds of things we take all that for granted and we need to restore the message of what it means to be an American I don't care what political parties and what color and your race and gender I don't care about any of those things what it is is a common thread that made this nation incredibly great I didn't like and so I I'm down there like getting on my stuff just home from deployment like and to be honest with you like looking back like that whole like there's a lot that happened like that was like a lot because I just did back to back Clearly like we're all here together you know everyone's going everyone brother like and like even the even the guy at the front does give a brother and and so we check into the we check we check in and and my roommate is a team guy bunny in mind and so as we're like in like he's like a good buddy of mine and I didn't even know he was there so we're there and he didn't make it but the so I get a text message from over sea is like watch the news tonight so sons up we get back and he was there and he's like he's like in tears he's like gonna have a drink so we go up we go on the skiff and he's like I thought you're dead and I was like why do we do this like this is terrible like you should have never done this like blah I was the only team guy that made it out of the training me and three other guys first of all I didn't really like I had an idea but he wouldn't tell me anything and I got how it went down was like I got a random email being like you know you've been like recommended for training can you be here on whatever the date was and I was in Iraq so I remember I went to this guy I was like a total toolbag he was like some like army guy or something it's a it's a tricky application you know most nonprofits you kind of like fill out the thing and it's like you know you like presence or being on it's like you're welcome like thanks like this is like gets in your head just like oh you're just like you just get on the airplane I mean when I came home I flew through DC I still had like you know pieces of concrete like you know I was still banged up like and I just like arrive home at the airport like and he's like um like there's like guys sleeping like right next to the horse like I know I look you guys come on we're not in the military now we understand up and like but but so six days of so the beginning of the program they're there they're getting all this good stuff that you're given and they're only eating like meat vegetables what do you say salt water and coffee that's it and and they're like well we like need you to go back like you know take this team bubble bond and if you don't come back we're in a doctor pet and that's when I was like back to like my massager chief story you know I was like like like or you're just like you know sometimes you get that kind of like raciness or you feel like you got to like down regulate a little bit like the best thing you can go out is go outside take your shoes off stand in the ground being total silence and stand there and it usually goes away from like three to four minutes and I started seeing like you know these kind of like I guess like you would say a hallucination or whatever I started like seeing all kinds of crazy images and I started feeling like I'm going out unconscious like this is like but you really do nothing right like the jury's out like wake up do hard work learn about yourself turn the shed off like meditate like you know eat a carrot every now and then like and life is gonna be pretty good for you um doesn't mean it's gonna be easy but you'll have the built-in tools and you'll be going to learn about your higher self and you know people can say like and everyone's like you know this for a while was like the mental health month and the mental health stuff was going on like crazy like you know everyone's like hey guys mental health month you know skydiving for mental health like I'm conducting a boxing clinic for mental health and bringing awareness to it and mental health and I was like and he looked at me he's like there is no buddy breathing you're in like a full face mask he's like you know just remember he was like a watch you don't he just he just looks at me like you're dead like and I was like it doesn't even look like we took anything out I mean like how many potato pillars did we have I was like we had like nine potato pillars meanwhile and Ethiopia I'm like I'm like we had so many things and what do things represent their measurements of time their measurements of time because you have to have time expanded and energy to get that thing I have a couple great shots of me and him boxing together and he hit me so hard one time that for the first time I'm like I had like kneeled down the ground I wasn't really sure like I'm on like roller skates like I and I I remember I was like hurt for like week living the dream like I mean ride in dirt bikes like I was just like living the dream uh and then uh when Josh died you know that was my first experience with losing somebody and then it just was like really real to me you know it just everything changed after that for me um and that that mission was you know he drowned uh so that was uh the way that whole thing went down how that that was tough that was that was a tough one and then the guys that were with us you know uh chasing got killed on entry uh he got shot in the stomach and then John Mark and we got shot in the neck on that so that was a huge loss in 2008 you know for the teams and eventually I started learning how to shoot horses and start Colts and these guys like I kind of thought initially they were all about like helping vets and all this kind of stuff they were like the most like crooked human beings I've ever met in my life like real legit crooks you know because the equine business is tough like in the cowboy world and all that kind of stuff I happened to know a team guy buddy of mine awesome guy and who works for a guy that has a ranch in Mexico so he's been ranching in Mexico like his whole life is like completely different I think what would happen if more people got out and immediately took on the next challenge in their life in the face of everything and where would they be today and you know that's my overarching goal is that like you know the sweat lodge is a super powerful thing and it can be terrifying how hot is this sweatlock and really hot like like really hotter than normal sauna but I'm like a steady-headed person because I was like really like a roller coaster of emotions like I had I had just experienced all this stuff and in a nutshell and next thing you know I'm like felt like I was being shitted on you know and but I never had another about what that ever got and it was a moment where I was like I knew I had like I had like finally like face that thing down which was like playing in the back of my head it was really weird when I would get into water situations or be in drowning which happened a lot like in free dive spear fishing you know right what is this what is this thing meaning that we all have we all gonna answer that question at some point in our life whether you get hit by a you know a scape order like and whack your head in the curb or you die combat or you you know eat yourself to death like you're all going to face those those things and to me the heroes journey is the journey of learning about yourself and using those tools to overcome the external circumstances that you face and so like over the 41 days like we have you know that every guy walks at least 80 miles in the program just to meals they'll spend 22 days in the wilderness they won't eat a piece of sugar they won't eat dairy they won't eat they won't have juice they will only eat meat vegetable salt water and black coffee and they will learn to meditate looking to an ice tank every single day they will start today with mindfulness they'll read books they'll go through leadership courses they'll learn to shoe horses ride horses they'll learn to see themselves and working with wild moustangs they'll be put in very dangerous the situations all these are just tools to shift focus from a person that is always looking out for answers to a person that is looking in for answers and then using those answers to then change the material world around them with their choices that are authentically theirs and that's called purpose and when you start to do that years always the dragon that steps out right in front of you right the dragon steps out in front of you I'm like preling nervous I'm like whoa this is like I'm like insurance and like you know this is like really a wild place and there's huge cliffs so there's only kind of one way in this water to the to the river and I would be very distracted like I because I always knew that I had to like leave again and then in um in 2014 I was in a really significant ordeal um I would say it was like up there in my top two or three events I had in my you know military-parameter career was uh actually I would say it's probably the top like it was the most insane gunfire and combat and carnage that I ever been involved and um you know that's when I kind of was like enough was enough from I had enough at that point you know and then I see like some nods like lights and the guys have made it around come down there scanning the shore and I like popped out and like here's like mud dude with like you know and I've been watching this thing drone footage all the things I've been observing this for a long time I understood the flow of the river and there was a dog leg which was like the point of no return like if you went there there was a huge cave and I would watch on the footage like logs like trees did go in there and like days later would be like blue come out so I knew if I went in there that I wouldn't live and and now I'm like my black bear story when I was like a teenager coming back from my dark years and this black bear like 10th is kind of like if I see a black bear literally the back of the jump I'm just like I just pick a stick up I'm like
