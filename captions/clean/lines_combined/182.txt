00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48 This is Jockel Podcast number 182.
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:07.28 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:09.28 Good evening, echo.
00:00:09.28 --> 00:00:10.68 Good evening.
00:00:10.68 --> 00:00:13.84 The insertion was flawless.
00:00:13.84 --> 00:00:18.92 We were in the wood line and on our way for a general area reconnaissance.
00:00:18.92 --> 00:00:23.52 This time we played it by the book, moving 10 minutes, then waiting 10 minutes.
00:00:23.52 --> 00:00:28.60 As we moved, I swear that I'd never run an eight-man team again.
00:00:28.60 --> 00:00:31.12 It was too cumbersome.
00:00:31.12 --> 00:00:37.04 In this target, the vegetation still made me a tad on edge as it had a second canopy in some
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:43.20 areas, but still gave us long lines of sight, something we weren't used to.
00:00:43.20 --> 00:00:48.60 As darkness approached, we looked for a good spot to R-O-N.
00:00:48.60 --> 00:00:52.64 With the flat terrain, finding a good R-O-N became really dicey.
00:00:52.64 --> 00:00:58.72 Alternatively, we'd look for high ground, dense vegetation, or an area far from any trail.
00:00:58.72 --> 00:01:03.66 Finally we found one, and saw a set up perimeter, set up the watch rotation, and oversaw
00:01:03.66 --> 00:01:07.000 the placement of extra clay more minds.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.56 In one area where the vegetation was thin, bubble placed a couple of toe poppers in the
00:01:11.56 --> 00:01:13.20 ground.
00:01:13.20 --> 00:01:15.04 I couldn't sleep.
00:01:15.04 --> 00:01:18.76 The flat terrain played on my mind.
00:01:18.76 --> 00:01:22.88 Our first light, the entire team, was awake, alert, retrieving the clay more minds and preparing
00:01:22.88 --> 00:01:26.44 for our move out of the R-O-N.
00:01:26.44 --> 00:01:33.12 After night on the jungle floor, I wanted an R-N-R anywhere with firm beds, clean sheets,
00:01:33.12 --> 00:01:35.56 and cold drinks.
00:01:35.56 --> 00:01:41.28 Because I insisted on carrying the PRC-25, there was little room in my backpack, except
00:01:41.28 --> 00:01:43.20 for essentials.
00:01:43.20 --> 00:01:49.04 At night, when I slept on the ground, I did so without an air mattress or hammock.
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:55.96 The sole item of comfort was an Army-issue pullover sweater that buttoned up to the neck.
00:01:55.96 --> 00:02:01.04 Whenever I put it on at night, I was always worried about Charlie hitting us when I was pulling
00:02:01.04 --> 00:02:02.84 the sweater over my head.
00:02:02.84 --> 00:02:09.32 It was one of the few creature comforts I allowed myself or had room for in my Rucksack.
00:02:09.32 --> 00:02:13.46 Shortly after first light, the green Hornets CNC aircraft flew into the edge of our
00:02:13.46 --> 00:02:16.96 AO for a routine commo check.
00:02:16.96 --> 00:02:22.16 I gave him a quick team, OK, and prepared to move the team out of the R-O-N.
00:02:22.16 --> 00:02:25.08 However the CNC crew told me to wrap up the mission.
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:28.24 There was another problem that he couldn't discuss on an open frequency.
00:02:28.24 --> 00:02:32.88 We knew the NVA monitored Saga FM radio transmissions and had radio direction finding
00:02:32.88 --> 00:02:34.20 equipment.
00:02:34.20 --> 00:02:39.28 The CNC pilot told us to find an LZ and let him know when we'd be ready for extra
00:02:39.28 --> 00:02:40.28 action.
00:02:40.28 --> 00:02:45.52 A few minutes later, the green Hornets roared into the new LZ picked us up and returned
00:02:45.52 --> 00:02:47.64 us to base.
00:02:47.64 --> 00:02:51.96 The reason we were yanked from the field this time stemmed from a tragedy in the Prairie
00:02:51.96 --> 00:02:56.24 Fryer area of operations on 30 November.
00:02:56.24 --> 00:03:01.32 An H-34 King B was shot out of the sky during an eldest son operation.
00:03:01.32 --> 00:03:07.36 Seven green berets from FOB-1 and FOB-4 were killed when an anti-aircraft round struck
00:03:07.36 --> 00:03:16.64 the Sakuarski chopper and ignited the ammunition on the aircraft killing everyone on board.
00:03:16.64 --> 00:03:23.72 One of the men killed and that ill-fated King B was staff sergeant Arthur E. Bader.
00:03:23.72 --> 00:03:25.44 I liked Bader.
00:03:25.44 --> 00:03:31.48 On my last night at FOB-1 before shipping out to FOB-6, I played in a poker game where
00:03:31.48 --> 00:03:34.44 he won a lot of money.
00:03:34.44 --> 00:03:43.84 Along with we played the more money Bader, the more money Bader, the more merouse he became.
00:03:43.84 --> 00:03:46.52 At one point, I asked him what was wrong.
00:03:46.52 --> 00:03:51.24 He was winning and he was a head several hundred dollars but kept complaining that he'd
00:03:51.24 --> 00:03:54.40 never spend the money.
00:03:54.40 --> 00:04:00.20 His response was that he had a premonition that he was going to die and that men about
00:04:00.20 --> 00:04:06.20 to die often went a lot of money that they would never spend.
00:04:06.20 --> 00:04:10.96 We all tried to josh him out of his dark mood but failed.
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:15.08 Bader was a unique special forces green beret.
00:04:15.08 --> 00:04:20.60 He had earned and lost three separate fortunes in between three terms in the service.
00:04:20.60 --> 00:04:26.12 He was in his 30s but still enjoyed SF, spoke fluid German and a few other languages
00:04:26.12 --> 00:04:31.56 and merely wanted to accomplish any mission assigned to him.
00:04:31.56 --> 00:04:37.06 On the long flight back to Fubai, I kept hearing him talk to us at the poker table that
00:04:37.06 --> 00:04:40.68 last night.
00:04:40.68 --> 00:04:49.24 Now he was gone.
00:04:49.24 --> 00:05:02.04 And that is the reality of war captured in the best selling book across the fence.
00:05:02.04 --> 00:05:08.32 And back with us again to talk about war as the author of that book and of another book
00:05:08.32 --> 00:05:12.84 called On the Ground and of a series of books called the Sog Chronicles of Man who has
00:05:12.84 --> 00:05:22.24 seen more than most and who has had more close calls than any man should have John Stryker
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:23.24 Meyer.
00:05:23.24 --> 00:05:30.56 And if you haven't listened to podcast 180 and 180 one yet go back and listen to them first
00:05:30.56 --> 00:05:37.000 to hear the background of this hero, this warrior special forces soldier and leader of
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.08 RT Idaho, a recon team for Mac Vsog working missions across the border from Vietnam
00:05:45.08 --> 00:05:47.56 into Laos and Cambodia.
00:05:47.56 --> 00:05:49.56 John, good evening sir.
00:05:49.56 --> 00:05:50.56 Good evening.
00:05:50.56 --> 00:05:51.56 Thanks for coming back again.
00:05:51.56 --> 00:05:54.76 Glad to be back every time you walk out of the studio about 10 minutes later.
00:05:54.76 --> 00:05:58.76 I said if you were in tech say hey can you come back again next week?
00:05:58.76 --> 00:05:59.76 We said so much fun.
00:05:59.76 --> 00:06:00.76 I can't say no.
00:06:00.76 --> 00:06:01.76 That's happened.
00:06:01.76 --> 00:06:02.76 That's that happened.
00:06:02.76 --> 00:06:05.04 That's how you ended up here again every time you walk out of here I go.
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:08.12 I want to hear you talk more.
00:06:08.12 --> 00:06:10.32 Hear more about what you've done.
00:06:10.32 --> 00:06:14.72 And yeah, no it's been awesome and there are spots where people have been hit me up.
00:06:14.72 --> 00:06:22.000 They've been just just in fraught with what you've been talking about and here in
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.60 Utah these stories has been interesting.
00:06:26.60 --> 00:06:27.60 You haven't seen this.
00:06:27.60 --> 00:06:31.40 Have you heard of a movie character named Jason Born?
00:06:31.40 --> 00:06:33.68 Have you heard of this guy?
00:06:33.68 --> 00:06:34.68 Yeah.
00:06:34.68 --> 00:06:37.76 So I posted a picture of you when you were 21 or 21 or 22.
00:06:37.76 --> 00:06:38.76 Right.
00:06:38.76 --> 00:06:40.12 He's my illegitimate son.
00:06:40.12 --> 00:06:41.12 Yeah.
00:06:41.12 --> 00:06:44.92 You got some definite comments about that.
00:06:44.92 --> 00:06:45.92 Interesting.
00:06:45.92 --> 00:06:46.92 Interesting.
00:06:46.92 --> 00:06:50.64 So yeah, we got the real guy back again.
00:06:50.64 --> 00:06:58.72 So I know we that first excerpt that I just read was from across the fence and I wanted
00:06:58.72 --> 00:07:05.96 to go back to your other book for a little bit, the book on the ground and then I just
00:07:05.96 --> 00:07:08.72 want to kind of bunch of things I want to just ask you about and talk to you about.
00:07:08.72 --> 00:07:11.16 But I wanted to cover one more section of this book on the ground.
00:07:11.16 --> 00:07:16.64 I was reading through it again yesterday and it's just again one of these situations
00:07:16.64 --> 00:07:22.80 where I don't know how you're here right now to be honest with you.
00:07:22.80 --> 00:07:30.92 Only buddy Grace and guys indeed to be con guys to smother our team and you guys had more
00:07:30.92 --> 00:07:33.36 than 100% casualties right.
00:07:33.36 --> 00:07:34.68 Correct.
00:07:34.68 --> 00:07:39.52 You had guys that you had some guys that had 789 purple hearts.
00:07:39.52 --> 00:07:41.52 Bob Howard was putting for 11.
00:07:41.52 --> 00:07:43.40 He only received 8.
00:07:43.40 --> 00:07:45.32 In my case I've been putting for two more.
00:07:45.32 --> 00:07:46.68 But it's just straplish.
00:07:46.68 --> 00:07:49.84 Now you look at guys that get to a legs blown off on arms plump.
00:07:49.84 --> 00:07:52.72 It's like almost embarrassed to take it.
00:07:52.72 --> 00:07:58.20 And anybody got a purple heart in our day, you got really ragged for it.
00:07:58.20 --> 00:08:01.28 Because you dumbass, you just couldn't get out of the way fast enough.
00:08:01.28 --> 00:08:03.60 You got a purple tart.
00:08:03.60 --> 00:08:06.52 I think we had one of my old Vietnam seal buddies.
00:08:06.52 --> 00:08:10.24 I think he called it the Viet Cong Achievement Medal.
00:08:10.24 --> 00:08:11.56 That's a good one.
00:08:11.56 --> 00:08:15.92 I like that.
00:08:15.92 --> 00:08:17.52 So you're putting for two more?
00:08:17.52 --> 00:08:18.52 How many did you get already?
00:08:18.52 --> 00:08:19.52 That was ten one.
00:08:19.52 --> 00:08:20.52 Okay.
00:08:20.52 --> 00:08:26.60 And again, spider parks and Pat Walkins, my you know, my gurus, my recon gurus.
00:08:26.60 --> 00:08:28.56 We had one that had been put in for it.
00:08:28.56 --> 00:08:32.52 Just minor straplish the paperwork disappeared.
00:08:32.52 --> 00:08:34.32 Another one had more straplish.
00:08:34.32 --> 00:08:38.12 And this time with a little bit, a lot more serious bleeding and scratching and stuff.
00:08:38.12 --> 00:08:39.12 A little blood.
00:08:39.12 --> 00:08:41.44 But I think serious compared to what guys for sure.
00:08:41.44 --> 00:08:42.76 They really get hammered.
00:08:42.76 --> 00:08:44.44 They said no, put in for it.
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:47.12 Some day you may have to go to the VA.
00:08:47.12 --> 00:08:48.12 Right.
00:08:48.12 --> 00:08:51.08 Even though the benefits, it's there.
00:08:51.08 --> 00:08:52.08 You get home loans.
00:08:52.08 --> 00:08:53.08 Oh, okay.
00:08:53.08 --> 00:08:54.08 It might be a future.
00:08:54.08 --> 00:08:56.08 If we get through this, it might be a future.
00:08:56.08 --> 00:08:58.08 Something that still gets a huge 20.
00:08:58.08 --> 00:09:00.44 Did it go to Vietnam after three purple hearts?
00:09:00.44 --> 00:09:01.44 Was that a rule?
00:09:01.44 --> 00:09:02.44 No.
00:09:02.44 --> 00:09:03.44 That's not a not a sock.
00:09:03.44 --> 00:09:04.44 That might be a normal.
00:09:04.44 --> 00:09:06.44 What about a normal soldier?
00:09:06.44 --> 00:09:07.44 I wouldn't know.
00:09:07.44 --> 00:09:09.44 I never spent any time in a regular unit.
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:10.44 Yeah, no.
00:09:10.44 --> 00:09:13.80 I mean Bob Howard, he took his eight.
00:09:13.80 --> 00:09:15.04 And he sort of had eleven.
00:09:15.04 --> 00:09:16.04 All the clusters.
00:09:16.04 --> 00:09:18.08 They guess they've read out a clusters for those.
00:09:18.08 --> 00:09:22.52 Yeah, and you talk about in saw Chronicles while you're one, what was it?
00:09:22.52 --> 00:09:27.72 16 guys went out, 16 special forces soldiers went out, and they got 33 purple hearts
00:09:27.72 --> 00:09:28.72 in four days.
00:09:28.72 --> 00:09:29.72 Oh, yeah.
00:09:29.72 --> 00:09:31.28 And probably go to gotten more.
00:09:31.28 --> 00:09:32.72 Sure.
00:09:32.72 --> 00:09:33.72 Ridiculous.
00:09:33.72 --> 00:09:34.72 Absolutely.
00:09:34.72 --> 00:09:35.72 It's crazy.
00:09:35.72 --> 00:09:36.72 Yeah.
00:09:36.72 --> 00:09:37.72 All right.
00:09:37.72 --> 00:09:40.88 We're going back to on the ground.
00:09:40.88 --> 00:09:41.88 Here we go.
00:09:41.88 --> 00:09:45.76 The Huey's lifted off made a general lazy turn and pointed their noses northwest.
00:09:45.76 --> 00:09:49.64 Once everyone was settled, I allowed my mind to wander as I looked out in Marford, and
00:09:49.64 --> 00:09:54.24 how beautiful the landscape was from several thousand feet up in the air, up where it was
00:09:54.24 --> 00:09:58.48 open and cool rather than closed in muggy.
00:09:58.48 --> 00:10:01.36 There was also a sense of inner peace and pride.
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:04.52 This is what I had volunteered and trained so hard for.
00:10:04.52 --> 00:10:08.68 This chance to run top-secret missions behind enemy lines, dangerous missions that made
00:10:08.68 --> 00:10:10.36 a difference.
00:10:10.36 --> 00:10:15.72 Like most special forces types, I couldn't stomach the monotonous routines of camp life.
00:10:15.72 --> 00:10:25.28 The ash and trash detail stuff, the petty rules, regulations, formations, and egos.
00:10:25.28 --> 00:10:26.44 More amazing yet.
00:10:26.44 --> 00:10:32.84 Here I was at the ripe old age of 22, sporting the exalted rank of E4 and the one zero
00:10:32.84 --> 00:10:36.72 of a sog recon team.
00:10:36.72 --> 00:10:38.84 22 years old.
00:10:38.84 --> 00:10:42.40 Young and dumb.
00:10:42.40 --> 00:10:43.40 Yeah.
00:10:43.40 --> 00:10:44.40 22 years old.
00:10:44.40 --> 00:10:45.40 You've been busted.
00:10:45.40 --> 00:10:48.28 If you hadn't been budged, you got busted down once or twice.
00:10:48.28 --> 00:10:49.28 Only once.
00:10:49.28 --> 00:10:51.08 So you would have been an E5 you think at this point?
00:10:51.08 --> 00:10:57.44 I would have been up most of the power for yes, at least an E5.
00:10:57.44 --> 00:10:59.76 That must have been crazy.
00:10:59.76 --> 00:11:04.36 Because usually you got promoted based on, if you run a missions, whenever the appropriate
00:11:04.36 --> 00:11:09.16 time frame was, to be in one grade before you be considered for the next, sagging was really
00:11:09.16 --> 00:11:11.92 good about getting the promotions, at least our people were.
00:11:11.92 --> 00:11:15.96 So as soon as you'd accomplish your time in rank, you get out of me, do you?
00:11:15.96 --> 00:11:16.96 Do you get out of me, do you?
00:11:16.96 --> 00:11:20.68 For a really quick.
00:11:20.68 --> 00:11:30.76 So when you, this idea of being an SF and just being on camp and on base and having the
00:11:30.76 --> 00:11:34.24 normal kind of routines, you just couldn't stand that.
00:11:34.24 --> 00:11:35.24 No.
00:11:35.24 --> 00:11:36.24 Yes, would rather be out in the field.
00:11:36.24 --> 00:11:41.88 Oh, yeah, it's just trash and nuts.
00:11:41.88 --> 00:11:42.88 Okay.
00:11:42.88 --> 00:11:43.88 All right.
00:11:43.88 --> 00:11:44.88 Here we go back to the book.
00:11:44.88 --> 00:11:47.20 I had been with RTI to hope for seven months now.
00:11:47.20 --> 00:11:51.40 By the end of hard work, lots of mission experience and simply having survived, I was
00:11:51.40 --> 00:11:52.92 now a team leader.
00:11:52.92 --> 00:11:56.16 At a moment's notice, I could have millions of millions of dollars worth of air support
00:11:56.16 --> 00:12:02.04 assets, some of the man by majors and lieutenant kernels, all doing my bidding, all giving
00:12:02.04 --> 00:12:04.52 their courageous best to save my bacon.
00:12:04.52 --> 00:12:08.92 I'd come a long way since flunking out a college and doing a stint as a garbage collector
00:12:08.92 --> 00:12:12.36 in the Ocembary National Park.
00:12:12.36 --> 00:12:16.84 My egotistical reveries were cut short when the door gunner on my side of the Huey decided
00:12:16.84 --> 00:12:21.32 to cut loose with a long burst of M60 machine gun fire right next to my ear.
00:12:21.32 --> 00:12:25.72 Fortunately, he was simply test firing it.
00:12:25.72 --> 00:12:30.64 You know, we would get, I guess, kind of similar is we'd be driving to a target, right,
00:12:30.64 --> 00:12:34.96 being in a home V. You know, sometimes the targets are an hour, sometimes two hours.
00:12:34.96 --> 00:12:37.24 You know, we did some long, long transit.
00:12:37.24 --> 00:12:44.76 But you would get time to sit there and think about stuff because, well, you're sitting
00:12:44.76 --> 00:12:47.76 there being transport, there's not too much you can do.
00:12:47.76 --> 00:12:51.16 You know, you're scanned and you're looking for, but you're in a helicopter, there's
00:12:51.16 --> 00:12:52.64 nothing to do, but think really.
00:12:52.64 --> 00:12:56.44 It was always amazing because it's just so beautiful.
00:12:56.44 --> 00:13:00.88 I mean, southeast Asia from the air, even when you went over a combat zone, you see
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:07.04 the bomb creators and you, but the jungle was just, just beautiful country.
00:13:07.04 --> 00:13:11.60 And then you get to under it and get into the underbell of the jungle that's like, you
00:13:11.60 --> 00:13:13.40 know, it's another whole world.
00:13:13.40 --> 00:13:15.40 The Starling contrast, you know?
00:13:15.40 --> 00:13:19.52 And like if you're in the desert, it has this own beauty.
00:13:19.52 --> 00:13:24.16 And it can be spell binding if you just watch it with a while, look at this, without realizing
00:13:24.16 --> 00:13:29.04 the somewhere, there's a little hole, some guy can pop out up and hit you with an RPG or
00:13:29.04 --> 00:13:31.16 detonate in your case.
00:13:31.16 --> 00:13:32.16 Does it smoke controls?
00:13:32.16 --> 00:13:33.16 Yeah.
00:13:33.16 --> 00:13:35.60 When you roll over.
00:13:35.60 --> 00:13:41.60 Did you, it sounds like you recognize this when you were doing these operations, you
00:13:41.60 --> 00:13:49.28 kind of knew that this was, I don't know, I guess I'm going to use this word.
00:13:49.28 --> 00:13:50.92 You were lucky to be there.
00:13:50.92 --> 00:13:57.60 Oh, clearly, because I won 100% when I was in Iraq and I only did two to pull on this
00:13:57.60 --> 00:14:02.60 to Iraq, I won 100% new every day that I was there.
00:14:02.60 --> 00:14:10.08 I knew that this was like my time, this is what I'd been, this is what I would lived
00:14:10.08 --> 00:14:11.08 for.
00:14:11.08 --> 00:14:12.08 And I knew that.
00:14:12.08 --> 00:14:14.32 It wasn't like I looked back and say, I wouldn't really wish I would have appreciated
00:14:14.32 --> 00:14:15.32 those days.
00:14:15.32 --> 00:14:20.92 No, when I was in them, I completely knew it and appreciated being there, like every
00:14:20.92 --> 00:14:21.92 single day.
00:14:21.92 --> 00:14:22.92 Yeah.
00:14:22.92 --> 00:14:30.32 And I, it was a nice feeling personally to think that, here we are, we're the best
00:14:30.32 --> 00:14:34.56 and we're running the missions and that's what we live for.
00:14:34.56 --> 00:14:42.12 Okay, now we're here, let's go do this and just hope to get the mission done and just
00:14:42.12 --> 00:14:44.84 wish the Dan track, or so leave your lungs, you get the mission done.
00:14:44.84 --> 00:14:48.52 Good do to our tapers, naturopio, W. Something like that.
00:14:48.52 --> 00:14:52.64 Oh, yeah, it felt good, but you know, it's like quiet professionals, just don't talk
00:14:52.64 --> 00:14:53.64 about that much.
00:14:53.64 --> 00:14:54.64 Yeah.
00:14:54.64 --> 00:15:00.20 Going back to the book as we approached the LZ, the team crowded the two doors of
00:15:00.20 --> 00:15:01.20 the helicopter.
00:15:01.20 --> 00:15:03.48 I was on the right half standing on the skid.
00:15:03.48 --> 00:15:07.24 Sau was kneeling behind me as hand on my shoulder ready to follow me out the door.
00:15:07.24 --> 00:15:13.52 Next to him was, hip, my one-one, John Bubba, sure, along with fuck our point man and
00:15:13.52 --> 00:15:17.64 Tuan are Grenadier, got ready to exit out the left side door.
00:15:17.64 --> 00:15:21.84 We all kept her eyes riveted on the looming jungle, scanning for any signs of movement
00:15:21.84 --> 00:15:24.36 in the tree lines surrounding our LZ.
00:15:24.36 --> 00:15:29.08 The top of the triple canopy growth of trees, vines and other vegetation was at least
00:15:29.08 --> 00:15:33.80 100 feet off the jungle floor and the opening into which we were descending reminded me of
00:15:33.80 --> 00:15:39.12 the mouth of a long dark tunnel at the bottom of which resided things, Alice never dreamed
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:42.60 of when she tumbled into that rabbit hole of hers.
00:15:42.60 --> 00:15:53.28 As we were swallowed up and the darkness increased, a cold chill ran down my spine.
00:15:53.28 --> 00:15:58.24 When you're going into these spots, so you had pre-identified this LZ prior to.
00:15:58.24 --> 00:15:59.60 Is that correct?
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:04.20 At that point, we were working with Kavi at Dornner Briefing.
00:16:04.20 --> 00:16:12.56 We would give out the official LZs, the primary secondary alternate and that would go to
00:16:12.56 --> 00:16:13.56 Saigon.
00:16:13.56 --> 00:16:18.44 Then we whispered as you're finding something else because we knew that there was a little
00:16:18.44 --> 00:16:19.44 scrubbed.
00:16:19.44 --> 00:16:23.24 And then, so by finding something else, you're basically just looking for a clearing of
00:16:23.24 --> 00:16:28.20 some kind of general within that target and usually to be somewhere as else they go.
00:16:28.20 --> 00:16:33.36 And somewhere as we were Saigon, the leak there wouldn't get the word back because we had
00:16:33.36 --> 00:16:34.36 that one target.
00:16:34.36 --> 00:16:36.32 We went in with the bomb.
00:16:36.32 --> 00:16:38.36 The LZ was little, he wired.
00:16:38.36 --> 00:16:42.32 And the top security had wire already with a 500 pounder.
00:16:42.32 --> 00:16:45.48 So we were beginning to do that much more often than.
00:16:45.48 --> 00:16:47.56 Could we had great cubbies?
00:16:47.56 --> 00:16:48.56 They knew what we did.
00:16:48.56 --> 00:16:52.08 The cubbies fly the area of operations before you inserted.
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:54.56 Like the AB4 or anything like that?
00:16:54.56 --> 00:16:56.52 Well, Dornner Day up, they would just fly over it.
00:16:56.52 --> 00:16:57.52 Sure.
00:16:57.52 --> 00:16:59.52 Is this picture or anything?
00:16:59.52 --> 00:17:00.52 No.
00:17:00.52 --> 00:17:01.52 No.
00:17:01.52 --> 00:17:06.48 Usually they would just do a VR visual reconnaissance and they would try to be subtle about
00:17:06.48 --> 00:17:11.48 like in early 68, we always flew a visual reconnaissance prior to the mission.
00:17:11.48 --> 00:17:14.12 And the NVA is not stupid.
00:17:14.12 --> 00:17:17.60 If they see a bird dog flying over a target, they figure well, pretty soon we're going
00:17:17.60 --> 00:17:20.60 to get visitors and sure enough.
00:17:20.60 --> 00:17:22.84 So like gave them time to get ready.
00:17:22.84 --> 00:17:27.72 So we basically cut out the VRs on our part.
00:17:27.72 --> 00:17:31.76 And then when cubbie go out, you know, a lot of guys have been flying.
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:35.04 They're more familiar with the VR with the helicopter.
00:17:35.04 --> 00:17:36.04 Oh no, no.
00:17:36.04 --> 00:17:42.80 Usually with South Vietnamese Air Force, they have a little 01 just like from World War
00:17:42.80 --> 00:17:43.80 2.
00:17:43.80 --> 00:17:47.48 The one from the battle from the bulls were heavy fondant's up there in the right seat.
00:17:47.48 --> 00:17:51.16 And the power's cut, this little cub, the piper cup is going 88 miles an hour.
00:17:51.16 --> 00:17:53.40 Top speed downhill.
00:17:53.40 --> 00:17:54.40 Yeah.
00:17:54.40 --> 00:17:58.60 And that's what, and so that would be most of our VRs.
00:17:58.60 --> 00:18:03.40 But then by Christmas, we pretty much cut that out.
00:18:03.40 --> 00:18:06.28 And that just because they were, that was given away.
00:18:06.28 --> 00:18:11.96 We used to ride on logistics air and kind of move the logistics air a little bit to
00:18:11.96 --> 00:18:13.88 over an air that we were going over.
00:18:13.88 --> 00:18:19.06 So no one would know that we were in there, that we were taking pictures, you know, like
00:18:19.06 --> 00:18:23.98 just logistics air, just an aircraft flying somewhere, they'd go in a straight line.
00:18:23.98 --> 00:18:27.62 They wouldn't, they'd just veer off a little bit so we could see what we wanted to see.
00:18:27.62 --> 00:18:28.62 Sure.
00:18:28.62 --> 00:18:32.50 And then also the fake ill fake inserts.
00:18:32.50 --> 00:18:35.70 Sometimes they didn't have the fuel to do a lot fake inserts.
00:18:35.70 --> 00:18:41.78 But they had the device called the nightingale where they would go in to a nightingale
00:18:41.78 --> 00:18:44.38 often pull the detonator on it.
00:18:44.38 --> 00:18:47.18 And it was sound like a firefight.
00:18:47.18 --> 00:18:49.18 So that would have a lot of commotion.
00:18:49.18 --> 00:18:53.02 And then they would jump up, go to a second LZ and put a send.
00:18:53.02 --> 00:18:56.98 And down south, we were with the green hornets.
00:18:56.98 --> 00:19:01.14 They really had it cold, because it was flat, down, up, down, up.
00:19:01.14 --> 00:19:05.86 So if the NV, we're trying to guess which of the three of four touchdowns where we were,
00:19:05.86 --> 00:19:07.70 they were really busy.
00:19:07.70 --> 00:19:08.70 Got it.
00:19:08.70 --> 00:19:13.78 Going back to the book as the chopper near the jungle floor, Bubba and I executed our first
00:19:13.78 --> 00:19:17.58 and standard operating procedure, which was checking the LZ for trip wires or booby traps while
00:19:17.58 --> 00:19:21.30 the rest of the team searched the surrounding jungle for any signs of trouble.
00:19:21.30 --> 00:19:24.82 After giving the all clear, the team was out the doors and all in the ground before the
00:19:24.82 --> 00:19:26.62 skids firmly touched down.
00:19:26.62 --> 00:19:29.26 How long would you hover there and look at the LZ for?
00:19:29.26 --> 00:19:30.26 Oh, not long.
00:19:30.26 --> 00:19:31.78 Like a matter of ten seconds.
00:19:31.78 --> 00:19:34.78 Just like you got to go in, touch down, get out.
00:19:34.78 --> 00:19:35.78 Sure.
00:19:35.78 --> 00:19:37.78 Yeah, we used to just jump out, lay down.
00:19:37.78 --> 00:19:40.42 Like the helicopter would just touch and take off.
00:19:40.42 --> 00:19:42.62 It would just jump out, lay down right there.
00:19:42.62 --> 00:19:43.62 We wouldn't move away from it.
00:19:43.62 --> 00:19:44.62 Just jump out, lay down.
00:19:44.62 --> 00:19:46.62 Modern day version of touching gun.
00:19:46.62 --> 00:19:47.62 Yeah.
00:19:47.62 --> 00:19:48.62 Yeah.
00:19:48.62 --> 00:19:51.82 We quickly headed into the wood line and set up a provisional perimeter where we could wait and
00:19:51.82 --> 00:19:53.82 listen.
00:19:53.82 --> 00:19:55.74 When again, we saw and heard nothing suspicious.
00:19:55.74 --> 00:19:58.94 We burrow deeper into the jungle where it was both dancer and darker.
00:19:58.94 --> 00:20:03.18 Like some furative predatory animal, we were looking to hide ourselves.
00:20:03.18 --> 00:20:07.74 After ten minutes of no threatening sounds or movements, I radioed Covey and gave him the
00:20:07.74 --> 00:20:09.62 message he had been waiting to hear.
00:20:09.62 --> 00:20:11.26 Team OK.
00:20:11.26 --> 00:20:16.86 He and others could take up breathing again, at least for the time being.
00:20:16.86 --> 00:20:21.10 The deeper we moved in, the deeper we moved the darker and more claustrophobic things
00:20:21.10 --> 00:20:22.50 became.
00:20:22.50 --> 00:20:27.78 Moving through the foliage was an excruciatingly slow and painful process with sweat stinging
00:20:27.78 --> 00:20:35.58 one's eyes, bugs crawling and feasting upon exposed skin and visibility cut to mere feet.
00:20:35.58 --> 00:20:41.22 It could be also be disorienting, especially when the maps we were given were so useless.
00:20:41.22 --> 00:20:46.94 And here was RT Idaho looking for fuel lines, some bright eyed Covey rider had spotted
00:20:46.94 --> 00:20:49.34 and directed aerostracks against.
00:20:49.34 --> 00:20:54.18 Intelligence reports said there was a second pipeline in this A.O. as well, regardless
00:20:54.18 --> 00:20:59.50 of how many any pipeline we found we were going to destroy.
00:20:59.50 --> 00:21:00.50 What were the maps?
00:21:00.50 --> 00:21:01.50 Were you one to 50 maps?
00:21:01.50 --> 00:21:02.50 Is that what you had?
00:21:02.50 --> 00:21:03.50 Yeah.
00:21:03.50 --> 00:21:04.50 One to 50,000?
00:21:04.50 --> 00:21:05.50 Right.
00:21:05.50 --> 00:21:07.14 But they would cut out from the big map.
00:21:07.14 --> 00:21:13.14 They would cut out like a 10 by 10 or 12 by 12 square so that if we were killed, they came
00:21:13.14 --> 00:21:17.62 across the map to be no other intel on a separate at one target area that we were on
00:21:17.62 --> 00:21:18.62 the ground.
00:21:18.62 --> 00:21:23.66 Now, I've gone into triple canopy jungle before with what he ever had as you know,
00:21:23.66 --> 00:21:25.98 one to 24 map.
00:21:25.98 --> 00:21:27.66 They're basically more detailed.
00:21:27.66 --> 00:21:28.66 Yes.
00:21:28.66 --> 00:21:32.98 Their twice as detailed and they're pretty good, but one to 50s are not that accurate.
00:21:32.98 --> 00:21:33.98 No.
00:21:33.98 --> 00:21:37.06 We had that one target where they had forgotten a mountain.
00:21:37.06 --> 00:21:38.78 You know, we're on a mountain.
00:21:38.78 --> 00:21:41.26 We're getting ready to go down the go over and we look at it.
00:21:41.26 --> 00:21:43.26 It's like, hey, they forgot one.
00:21:43.26 --> 00:21:44.26 It's not really good.
00:21:44.26 --> 00:21:48.98 Stretch your mission out when you're in triple canopy.
00:21:48.98 --> 00:21:49.82 Cluster phobic.
00:21:49.82 --> 00:21:53.42 You use that word cluster phobic quite a bit in this section.
00:21:53.42 --> 00:21:56.50 Is this jungle just tight?
00:21:56.50 --> 00:21:57.50 Very.
00:21:57.50 --> 00:22:01.86 Yeah, because again, sometimes you had to keep sight on the guy in front of you as you
00:22:01.86 --> 00:22:06.30 moved because he just becomes separated so easily.
00:22:06.30 --> 00:22:12.10 Because of the dense vegetation, of course, a lot of times our Vietnamese were shorter.
00:22:12.10 --> 00:22:13.10 They could get through a quick.
00:22:13.10 --> 00:22:15.10 Well, we would be down on our knees.
00:22:15.10 --> 00:22:18.50 I wore out more pants crawling through the jungle.
00:22:18.50 --> 00:22:20.30 I know, I saw a picture.
00:22:20.30 --> 00:22:21.62 I was looking at the pictures in the books.
00:22:21.62 --> 00:22:22.62 I saw a picture.
00:22:22.62 --> 00:22:24.62 One of the images is that some of those guys were really small.
00:22:24.62 --> 00:22:25.62 Oh, yeah.
00:22:25.62 --> 00:22:26.62 Really small.
00:22:26.62 --> 00:22:27.98 98 pounds, so can wet.
00:22:27.98 --> 00:22:29.98 But 50 pounds are hard.
00:22:29.98 --> 00:22:32.46 That's awesome.
00:22:32.46 --> 00:22:34.54 All right, I go back to the book.
00:22:34.54 --> 00:22:36.58 But I had more immediate and pressing concerns.
00:22:36.58 --> 00:22:40.90 The adrenaline rush that always accompanied an insertion had pretty much worn off.
00:22:40.90 --> 00:22:44.58 And another characteristic sensation had begun to take its place.
00:22:44.58 --> 00:22:49.98 It was a feeling of familiarity and comfort combined with an e-resensitive for boating.
00:22:49.98 --> 00:22:52.42 Both were a product of experience.
00:22:52.42 --> 00:22:56.98 I was comfortable because I was surrounded by extraordinary, well-trained and fiercely
00:22:56.98 --> 00:23:00.34 devoted team that knew what it was doing.
00:23:00.34 --> 00:23:06.14 Yet we also had stepped in enough accidental shit and had encountered so many hostile
00:23:06.14 --> 00:23:11.86 enemy units that it was impossible to not feel serious anxiety.
00:23:11.86 --> 00:23:16.74 In fact, I figured that when I stopped being scared, shitless, I would be on my way to
00:23:16.74 --> 00:23:19.06 buying the farm.
00:23:19.06 --> 00:23:24.34 Cochines had cost more than one life.
00:23:24.34 --> 00:23:30.94 But you still get that little mixed feeling of comfort, but fear and anxiety at the same
00:23:30.94 --> 00:23:31.94 time.
00:23:31.94 --> 00:23:32.94 Yes.
00:23:32.94 --> 00:23:37.94 You know, the whole adrenaline of the e-mail is, you get a certain, you're just pumped.
00:23:37.94 --> 00:23:40.26 And at some point you get off and get on the ground.
00:23:40.26 --> 00:23:44.42 It's just because you guys would hit so many times you would insert immediately get contacted.
00:23:44.42 --> 00:23:46.10 A lot of times, yeah.
00:23:46.10 --> 00:23:52.66 So once you be amped up going in and then when there's nothing there, that starts to fade.
00:23:52.66 --> 00:23:56.74 Yeah, then you finally get on the ground, it's like, oh, at last, we're on the ground.
00:23:56.74 --> 00:23:59.10 Now, let's get on with the mission.
00:23:59.10 --> 00:24:00.58 We're about to trackers.
00:24:00.58 --> 00:24:01.58 Let's get moving.
00:24:01.58 --> 00:24:03.70 But let's also stay cognizant.
00:24:03.70 --> 00:24:07.58 Could it keep our situational awareness tight?
00:24:07.58 --> 00:24:13.18 And that, you know, this is one of the reasons I highlighted this section is, you know,
00:24:13.18 --> 00:24:16.54 just this is something that, you know, what we talk about complacency all the time.
00:24:16.54 --> 00:24:21.14 I know there was a board of Marine Corps units we were with the three eight and
00:24:21.14 --> 00:24:25.90 a body, they had a, that aside, that signs around their compound complacency kills.
00:24:25.90 --> 00:24:26.90 Yeah.
00:24:26.90 --> 00:24:27.90 For sure.
00:24:27.90 --> 00:24:35.54 But this idea of, and you know, I also talk to young military guys, young seals, that,
00:24:35.54 --> 00:24:37.30 you know, they're, they're scared of this, they're scared of that.
00:24:37.30 --> 00:24:40.74 That's like, I always tell them, good, you know, you should, you should be afraid.
00:24:40.74 --> 00:24:43.54 Because if you're afraid, you're going to prepare more, you're going to train harbor, you're
00:24:43.54 --> 00:24:47.18 going to, you're not going to cut any corners, you're not going to get complacent.
00:24:47.18 --> 00:24:52.74 And that's the same thing that you're saying here is you'd seen cockiness, cost people
00:24:52.74 --> 00:24:55.34 their lives because they think, oh, we can just get away with whatever.
00:24:55.34 --> 00:24:57.34 Yeah, if you're not scared, I'm scared of you.
00:24:57.34 --> 00:24:58.34 Really?
00:24:58.34 --> 00:24:59.34 Yeah.
00:24:59.34 --> 00:25:00.34 Yeah.
00:25:00.34 --> 00:25:06.18 And then you have to overcome that though, because you can't let that get, get control.
00:25:06.18 --> 00:25:09.42 And you were talking before we started recording, we were talking about a guy that was in
00:25:09.42 --> 00:25:13.54 a firefight and there was one guy that didn't fire a shot, stayed curled up in a ball,
00:25:13.54 --> 00:25:14.54 praying.
00:25:14.54 --> 00:25:15.54 Yeah.
00:25:15.54 --> 00:25:19.70 That's when that's when fear is not, not your friend.
00:25:19.70 --> 00:25:26.06 Yeah, our guys wanted to shoot him.
00:25:26.06 --> 00:25:29.54 So you got a balance that, you got to have the fear, you got to feel it, but you got
00:25:29.54 --> 00:25:30.54 to deal with it.
00:25:30.54 --> 00:25:34.02 Correct.
00:25:34.02 --> 00:25:36.30 We had compasses.
00:25:36.30 --> 00:25:39.78 So we knew the general direction we were headed, which was to the northwest away from
00:25:39.78 --> 00:25:40.78 the LZ.
00:25:40.78 --> 00:25:43.94 We had been working our way slowly through the underbrush for about an hour when suddenly
00:25:43.94 --> 00:25:46.02 we heard an explosion behind us.
00:25:46.02 --> 00:25:50.06 It had to have been the Claymore bubble rig to go off if anyone tried to follow us off
00:25:50.06 --> 00:25:51.46 the LZ.
00:25:51.46 --> 00:25:56.42 It's detonation, singled, signaled a profound change in the situation.
00:25:56.42 --> 00:26:00.42 The hunters were about to become the hunted.
00:26:00.42 --> 00:26:05.74 In the jungle, there are almost always animal noises of some kind and these suddenly
00:26:05.74 --> 00:26:07.94 fell silent.
00:26:07.94 --> 00:26:12.62 In the quiet, we could hear some distressing sounds to the west, sounds that were not
00:26:12.62 --> 00:26:22.34 of a jungle kind, but those of men on the move we were not alone.
00:26:22.34 --> 00:26:26.14 Welcome to the jungle, baby.
00:26:26.14 --> 00:26:28.82 Yes indeed.
00:26:28.82 --> 00:26:34.02 How do you know that the Claymore's that you rigged weren't set off by some kind of monkey
00:26:34.02 --> 00:26:36.34 or whatever, some kind of animal?
00:26:36.34 --> 00:26:41.22 Would you guys rig a certain way that that was unlikely?
00:26:41.22 --> 00:26:45.38 The way bubble and the Frenchman later would do it in Lin.
00:26:45.38 --> 00:26:50.74 They would put it in an area where it would be easiest for the trackers to follow.
00:26:50.74 --> 00:26:52.70 So you'd just based on human nature.
00:26:52.70 --> 00:26:53.70 You're going to go through this.
00:26:53.70 --> 00:26:56.98 Take part, you're going to go where it's easier to travel.
00:26:56.98 --> 00:26:58.94 And it could have been an animal.
00:26:58.94 --> 00:27:02.34 But basically it's an NVA animal.
00:27:02.34 --> 00:27:04.86 Yeah.
00:27:04.86 --> 00:27:08.46 The coincidence would be too much and the chances are it's just NVA.
00:27:08.46 --> 00:27:13.50 And if it is a monkey as opposed to an NVA, we'll find that out within the next couple
00:27:13.50 --> 00:27:14.50 hours.
00:27:14.50 --> 00:27:17.42 On the other hand, let's get ready.
00:27:17.42 --> 00:27:21.86 And there was an enemy moving in the jungle.
00:27:21.86 --> 00:27:24.42 The animals would stop making noises.
00:27:24.42 --> 00:27:26.38 It all depends how close they were.
00:27:26.38 --> 00:27:30.22 But yes, lots of, that's why the most important thing in the jungle was listening.
00:27:30.22 --> 00:27:31.22 Yeah.
00:27:31.22 --> 00:27:33.34 I mean, 10 and 10 sounds pretty extreme.
00:27:33.34 --> 00:27:38.66 But it really gives you time to hear what's going on.
00:27:38.66 --> 00:27:40.10 Because you're a lot of time, you can't see it.
00:27:40.10 --> 00:27:42.10 That's the best sense in the jungle.
00:27:42.10 --> 00:27:45.86 Like I said, I've been in Triple Canopy and we've done Patrol and in Triple Canopy.
00:27:45.86 --> 00:27:47.42 And you could hit by monkeys too, right?
00:27:47.42 --> 00:27:48.42 Yeah.
00:27:48.42 --> 00:27:51.26 We had monkeys freak us out.
00:27:51.26 --> 00:27:57.98 But that the sense just so people can understand, you can only see it in that thick jungle.
00:27:57.98 --> 00:27:59.98 Sometimes you can only see five feet.
00:27:59.98 --> 00:28:00.98 Sure.
00:28:00.98 --> 00:28:01.98 Five or ten feet at the most.
00:28:01.98 --> 00:28:07.54 So you patrol for 10 minutes and then you just stop everyone is quiet and you listen
00:28:07.54 --> 00:28:10.38 to see if anyone's following you to see if there's any other movement out there.
00:28:10.38 --> 00:28:11.70 That's what you're doing.
00:28:11.70 --> 00:28:12.70 Sure.
00:28:12.70 --> 00:28:18.46 I mean, and it's so thick that if I'm behind a point man or sometimes it would be a point
00:28:18.46 --> 00:28:21.06 man was sal and myself.
00:28:21.06 --> 00:28:22.06 Why would never see a point man?
00:28:22.06 --> 00:28:27.34 I would just keep an eye on sal and the guy behind me would just be on my backpack.
00:28:27.34 --> 00:28:30.30 I wouldn't, I couldn't tell you where the point man was.
00:28:30.30 --> 00:28:34.38 I just follow sal and the vegetation was that thick a lot of times.
00:28:34.38 --> 00:28:43.10 And again, I'm depending on the Vietnamese because they know they didn't have a jungle
00:28:43.10 --> 00:28:44.10 better to make.
00:28:44.10 --> 00:28:46.22 How come the animals would stop making noise?
00:28:46.22 --> 00:28:48.54 Would the animal stop making noise when you would patrol?
00:28:48.54 --> 00:28:50.54 I would assume.
00:28:50.54 --> 00:28:53.22 But once we settle down, things would come back normal.
00:28:53.22 --> 00:28:56.94 So when you stop moving, then the sounds would escalate.
00:28:56.94 --> 00:29:01.58 And if they didn't have to 10 minutes ago, the puck of faker tightens up to a little
00:29:01.58 --> 00:29:06.18 little bit more.
00:29:06.18 --> 00:29:13.26 I immediately signaled Falk, who is on point to head north.
00:29:13.26 --> 00:29:15.86 This would take us up a hill that dominated our right flank.
00:29:15.86 --> 00:29:19.26 The climb was pretty severe, which was good and bad news.
00:29:19.26 --> 00:29:23.06 Well, it made the going rough at all so meant we were gaining some genuine high ground
00:29:23.06 --> 00:29:26.70 and high ground is the preferred position when it comes to defense.
00:29:26.70 --> 00:29:30.58 The steepness also meant the enemy would have to work as hard as we were.
00:29:30.58 --> 00:29:35.74 I couldn't tell how close the NVA trackers were or how many of them were headed our way.
00:29:35.74 --> 00:29:40.82 But I knew if push came to shove, I wanted to be looking down on them.
00:29:40.82 --> 00:29:42.66 Always take the high ground.
00:29:42.66 --> 00:29:43.66 Always.
00:29:43.66 --> 00:29:46.06 That's just military maximum.
00:29:46.06 --> 00:29:50.50 And you know, I actually say you take the moral high ground as well.
00:29:50.50 --> 00:29:52.54 Take the high ground to take you.
00:29:52.54 --> 00:29:54.54 Amen.
00:29:54.54 --> 00:30:00.06 When we reach the hilltop, just as dark clouds unleashed the torrent of rain.
00:30:00.06 --> 00:30:05.10 While Bubba and Sau began setting out a perimeter of claymores, I contacted Covey and
00:30:05.10 --> 00:30:08.90 appraised him of the situation, namely that it didn't look good and that we might be calling
00:30:08.90 --> 00:30:11.26 for an immediate extraction before nightfall.
00:30:11.26 --> 00:30:13.46 Did you guys speak at all?
00:30:13.46 --> 00:30:16.18 Only minimal, because most of it would be hand-saint-looking.
00:30:16.18 --> 00:30:18.18 Just everything, as you can see.
00:30:18.18 --> 00:30:21.78 Estrogationally, you'd have to whisper near.
00:30:21.78 --> 00:30:24.90 But if we just void it as much as we could.
00:30:24.90 --> 00:30:28.82 But something like this, just so people understand, something like this, you're on patrol.
00:30:28.82 --> 00:30:30.18 You're not saying anything.
00:30:30.18 --> 00:30:32.14 You head up the hill, you don't say anything.
00:30:32.14 --> 00:30:35.34 You get to perimeter, you give the perimeter signal, you don't say anything.
00:30:35.34 --> 00:30:36.90 Everyone knows what to do when you're in there.
00:30:36.90 --> 00:30:39.18 You could go days out in the field without talking.
00:30:39.18 --> 00:30:40.66 Oh, yeah, absolutely.
00:30:40.66 --> 00:30:45.54 Because with the training, as a pushe, you got the visual with the person that you're
00:30:45.54 --> 00:30:46.54 signaling.
00:30:46.54 --> 00:30:50.70 Like, in my case, if I'm behind fuck the point, man, I'm telling him what to do and I'll
00:30:50.70 --> 00:30:54.30 turn around, tell the guy behind me, same signals, and then we go.
00:30:54.30 --> 00:30:54.30 Yeah.
00:30:54.30 --> 00:31:03.10 While I was talking to Covey, SAU who had moved north to set out as Claymore suddenly opened
00:31:03.10 --> 00:31:07.22 fire on full automatic, a sure sign we had visitors.
00:31:07.22 --> 00:31:12.30 This was immediately confirmed when heavy AK-47 fire ripped out of the jungle in response.
00:31:12.30 --> 00:31:18.14 In less than five seconds, the well-practiced SAU had fired off all 18 rounds in his car
00:31:18.14 --> 00:31:23.26 15, set off the claymores and reloaded his weapon while falling back to join the rest
00:31:23.26 --> 00:31:24.26 of the team.
00:31:24.26 --> 00:31:26.42 That's legit right there.
00:31:26.42 --> 00:31:28.38 SAU was making things happen.
00:31:28.38 --> 00:31:30.78 He was the man.
00:31:30.78 --> 00:31:34.38 Would you guys be trained in these immediate action drills, mag changes?
00:31:34.38 --> 00:31:35.54 I mean, everything that we do, right?
00:31:35.54 --> 00:31:36.54 You guys drill that stuff.
00:31:36.54 --> 00:31:37.54 Every drill in drill in drill.
00:31:37.54 --> 00:31:42.02 If we're in camp, we go down often.
00:31:42.02 --> 00:31:46.46 Just particularly in the beginning, through June, my first couple of months, whenever
00:31:46.46 --> 00:31:48.98 every day, hundreds of rounds.
00:31:48.98 --> 00:31:51.74 And when this happens, these guys are called.
00:31:51.74 --> 00:31:56.98 The enemy is very close to you because you can at least know that they're there.
00:31:56.98 --> 00:31:57.98 They've got to be what?
00:31:57.98 --> 00:32:00.38 15, 20, maybe 30 meters away.
00:32:00.38 --> 00:32:05.30 In that case here, I forget how close they weren't that far for SAU to blow his claymore
00:32:05.30 --> 00:32:11.74 and the car 15 and reload and do it one more time.
00:32:11.74 --> 00:32:12.74 Back to the book.
00:32:12.74 --> 00:32:16.94 Bird the background shots and explosions, so he was not overly surprised when I stated
00:32:16.94 --> 00:32:18.26 the obvious.
00:32:18.26 --> 00:32:22.50 We had a prairie fire emergency in progress and we wanted out ASAP.
00:32:22.50 --> 00:32:23.50 The mission was over.
00:32:23.50 --> 00:32:25.70 The fuel lines would have to wait until another day.
00:32:25.70 --> 00:32:28.50 The focus now became saving our asses.
00:32:28.50 --> 00:32:34.18 To this end, every air sat with air sat with in striking distance would immediately be
00:32:34.18 --> 00:32:36.58 vector to our target area.
00:32:36.58 --> 00:32:38.62 The odds would soon turn.
00:32:38.62 --> 00:32:42.94 If not necessarily in our favor, very decidedly against the enemy.
00:32:42.94 --> 00:32:53.18 RTI to ho might not make it out alive, but neither would the NVA.
00:32:53.18 --> 00:32:56.62 Guys had some serious confidence in that air power.
00:32:56.62 --> 00:32:59.30 Yeah, that was our lifeline.
00:32:59.30 --> 00:33:06.76 I mean, a major edge that we had and whenever we could use it, we'd use it because it was
00:33:06.76 --> 00:33:11.38 only matter time before they would get more bodies there and we had teams ahead been over
00:33:11.38 --> 00:33:15.28 run and 67, 68.
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:18.84 So we knew the potential for things to go really wrong.
00:33:18.84 --> 00:33:23.16 That was one of the things that could neutralize the manpower.
00:33:23.16 --> 00:33:25.72 When they had the enemy had so many troops.
00:33:25.72 --> 00:33:28.44 Did teams ever get overrun while they had air power?
00:33:28.44 --> 00:33:30.44 Oh sure.
00:33:30.44 --> 00:33:32.24 Sadly, yes, we were.
00:33:32.24 --> 00:33:39.36 Yeah, they would just keep coming and is self-admetal honors recipients, Fred Zebattowski,
00:33:39.36 --> 00:33:46.52 Robert Howard, SF on admissions and they were directing air power.
00:33:46.52 --> 00:33:48.52 Still just got overrun.
00:33:48.52 --> 00:33:51.12 That's all part of the horror of being on the ground.
00:33:51.12 --> 00:33:53.52 We guess they really determined, Phil.
00:33:53.52 --> 00:33:58.16 So even though you have confidence in your air power, you know there's limitations.
00:33:58.16 --> 00:34:04.08 Yeah, if things really go bad, that air power is not going to be able to save you.
00:34:04.08 --> 00:34:05.08 Correct.
00:34:05.08 --> 00:34:10.28 And again, it's time, weather and where are you in the jungle?
00:34:10.28 --> 00:34:14.44 And a triple canopy, if you're in triple canopy, all you could do is maybe gun runs and
00:34:14.44 --> 00:34:21.48 you're not even sure how effective it'll be, but at least you get your attention.
00:34:21.48 --> 00:34:26.04 Going back to the book, call King Beast, call King Beast, Boku Vc, Boku Vc.
00:34:26.04 --> 00:34:30.52 It was clear, sound, and I shared similar praise of our situation and the same thoughts
00:34:30.52 --> 00:34:33.04 about what needed to be done.
00:34:33.04 --> 00:34:37.72 The only hitch was how to pull it off, what with darkness approaching a storm raging and
00:34:37.72 --> 00:34:40.40 no helicopters anywhere near us.
00:34:40.40 --> 00:34:46.56 I didn't want to add to either sounds or the team's angst, so I didn't share my misgivings.
00:34:46.56 --> 00:34:51.28 Instead, I gave Kovie the direction and probable distance we'd moved from the LZ and
00:34:51.28 --> 00:34:55.48 told him I was about to throw two yellow smoke grenades to mark a location.
00:34:55.48 --> 00:35:00.04 I threw two hoping some of the smoke would somehow travel up through the thick vegetation
00:35:00.04 --> 00:35:04.80 and into the clear where Kovie could see it.
00:35:04.80 --> 00:35:07.36 Kovie had good and bad news.
00:35:07.36 --> 00:35:12.04 He thought he had our location, but he doubted seriously if he could get extraction helicopters
00:35:12.04 --> 00:35:14.16 to us before nightfall.
00:35:14.16 --> 00:35:17.12 Not good, not good at all.
00:35:17.12 --> 00:35:23.12 We now had confirmed enemy north and south of us and they were closing in.
00:35:23.12 --> 00:35:28.40 South frantically signaled Bubba to set off the south facing Klamors when Bubba hesitated
00:35:28.40 --> 00:35:29.40 for a second.
00:35:29.40 --> 00:35:32.84 I could hear South his coat of Kovie-Dow-VC.
00:35:32.84 --> 00:35:34.16 How do you say that?
00:35:34.16 --> 00:35:35.16 Kovie-Dow-VC.
00:35:35.16 --> 00:35:38.88 Do you mean the misrecill?
00:35:38.88 --> 00:35:47.000 Duma, which is Vietnamese for mother, mother fuckers.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.32 As the Klamors erupted, South pulled the pin on the fragmentation grenade and lobbed it
00:35:51.32 --> 00:35:57.64 into the boiling dust and smoke even more enemy troops came up the slope.
00:35:57.64 --> 00:36:02.36 With my ears ringing from the blast, I thought I heard additional movement to the east,
00:36:02.36 --> 00:36:03.88 but I couldn't be sure.
00:36:03.88 --> 00:36:09.36 Because the NVA had abandoned any pretense of stealth, I soon verified they were coming
00:36:09.36 --> 00:36:11.24 from that flank as well.
00:36:11.24 --> 00:36:13.000 And there were lots of them.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.20 As these unseen forces maneuvered in for the kill, the jungle took on its most terrifying
00:36:18.20 --> 00:36:20.60 and claustrophobic reality.
00:36:20.60 --> 00:36:26.000 But a friendly place in the very best of circumstances, it was now about the worst place
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.76 in the world to be.
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:33.32 Again, that claustrophobic sense.
00:36:33.32 --> 00:36:38.68 Can you see the sky in the stripple canopy?
00:36:38.68 --> 00:36:43.80 Depends, sometimes you can see it glimpses of it or it would be a little opening.
00:36:43.80 --> 00:36:48.000 So he was able to see the smoke, sometimes you pop a yellow smoke, which is bright, and
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.52 wouldn't even be able to get through.
00:36:53.52 --> 00:36:57.24 Everyone was cutting loose as fast as he could and effort to suppress the enemy's fire
00:36:57.24 --> 00:36:58.52 and drive him back.
00:36:58.52 --> 00:37:02.84 Twanted managed to find some narrow openings in the vegetation that were shooting rounds
00:37:02.84 --> 00:37:06.16 with his M79 grenade launcher.
00:37:06.16 --> 00:37:07.80 And suddenly the jungle went silent.
00:37:07.80 --> 00:37:13.16 As if someone had thrown a switch or hit the mute button, the only sounds were the metallic
00:37:13.16 --> 00:37:20.40 clicks as both RT Idaho and the NVA locked fresh magazines into their weapons.
00:37:20.40 --> 00:37:22.20 The fight was far from over.
00:37:22.20 --> 00:37:27.02 In fact, the party was just getting started and we were simply changing records for the
00:37:27.02 --> 00:37:29.72 next dance with death.
00:37:29.72 --> 00:37:37.04 The jungle again erupted with deafening roar of gunfire.
00:37:37.04 --> 00:37:38.52 So that's sketchy.
00:37:38.52 --> 00:37:40.12 That's got to be a horrifying feeling.
00:37:40.12 --> 00:37:41.12 Boom.
00:37:41.12 --> 00:37:43.12 That's why everyone dumps their mags.
00:37:43.12 --> 00:37:46.60 There's that moment of silence and then that silence, all you hear is reload happening.
00:37:46.60 --> 00:37:51.36 And you know too, when that happens, how when your adrenaline is pumping, when you're
00:37:51.36 --> 00:37:55.000 here, your time frame has expanded.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.20 So now instead of like, you just read it, that's a quick, it is bam bam, you're saying,
00:37:59.20 --> 00:38:02.60 but now, and then you're drowning, it feels like it's slowed down.
00:38:02.60 --> 00:38:04.72 You can feel the magazine coming out.
00:38:04.72 --> 00:38:07.80 You hear it click, click, everybody else is ramming them in.
00:38:07.80 --> 00:38:08.80 Come on, boys.
00:38:08.80 --> 00:38:12.92 Come down on this first and our guys won.
00:38:12.92 --> 00:38:18.52 With all the noise, I had to shove the radio handset, damn near, inside my ear to hear what
00:38:18.52 --> 00:38:20.56 Kofi was trying to tell me.
00:38:20.56 --> 00:38:23.16 The good news bad news routine continued.
00:38:23.16 --> 00:38:26.84 The good news was that some of the yellow smoke had finally made it, it's way to where
00:38:26.84 --> 00:38:28.32 Kofi could see it.
00:38:28.32 --> 00:38:32.20 But the bad news was we were nowhere near the NLZ.
00:38:32.20 --> 00:38:36.28 He wanted to know if we could fight our way back to where we had been inserted.
00:38:36.28 --> 00:38:42.24 Negative, I yelled as fuck, Bubba, and Hap all opened up on some NVA who had managed to sneak
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:43.92 up from the south.
00:38:43.92 --> 00:38:47.000 There were green tracers whizzing all around me.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.44 Kofi would have to wait.
00:38:48.44 --> 00:38:54.96 And that's another good point because in this war, the enemy almost always had green
00:38:54.96 --> 00:38:55.96 tracers.
00:38:55.96 --> 00:38:56.96 Always.
00:38:56.96 --> 00:38:57.96 Okay.
00:38:57.96 --> 00:38:58.96 Yeah, for us, the enemy didn't always have green.
00:38:58.96 --> 00:38:59.96 They've had red.
00:38:59.96 --> 00:39:02.64 In fact, most of the time, well, a lot of times I had red.
00:39:02.64 --> 00:39:03.64 Because they had.
00:39:03.64 --> 00:39:04.64 Well, no kidding.
00:39:04.64 --> 00:39:05.64 Yeah.
00:39:05.64 --> 00:39:09.96 So it was, you know, they just got their ammo from all different sources.
00:39:09.96 --> 00:39:13.52 And so it wasn't just this, there wasn't just, hey, they're green and we're red.
00:39:13.52 --> 00:39:15.80 It was mostly red.
00:39:15.80 --> 00:39:17.16 Some green occasionally, but.
00:39:17.16 --> 00:39:18.16 Wow.
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:19.16 Yeah.
00:39:19.16 --> 00:39:20.16 Yeah.
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:24.36 Um.
00:39:24.36 --> 00:39:30.56 After helping repel the attack, I got back on the radio to impress upon Kofi, the direness of our
00:39:30.56 --> 00:39:31.56 straits.
00:39:31.56 --> 00:39:32.88 But of course, he already knew that.
00:39:32.88 --> 00:39:37.28 So in his convoyce, which could drive a one zero to a merger, he said, we don't have
00:39:37.28 --> 00:39:38.28 a lot of time.
00:39:38.28 --> 00:39:40.12 No shit.
00:39:40.12 --> 00:39:43.76 The only chance we have is about a hundred meters north by northeast from your location.
00:39:43.76 --> 00:39:47.72 There's a small hole in the roof, and we might be able to get strings down to you.
00:39:47.72 --> 00:39:50.76 He inquired if we had much activity to our north.
00:39:50.76 --> 00:39:53.44 It depended, I thought, on what you meant by much.
00:39:53.44 --> 00:39:55.44 And activity.
00:39:55.44 --> 00:40:00.20 I reminded him that north was where the whole shooting match got started and while the
00:40:00.20 --> 00:40:05.16 bullet, while I thought we had pretty much taken that group of NVA out of action, I couldn't
00:40:05.16 --> 00:40:06.32 be sure.
00:40:06.32 --> 00:40:08.36 When I finished, he said, don't worry.
00:40:08.36 --> 00:40:13.76 I have a pair of A1E's on station, and I'll have the leader make a gun run, and then
00:40:13.76 --> 00:40:18.24 give, and then have his wingmen follow with 500 pounders.
00:40:18.24 --> 00:40:22.16 Before I could say, Roger that the first guy radar roared across our northern perimeter,
00:40:22.16 --> 00:40:24.92 his 20 millimeter cannons blazing away.
00:40:24.92 --> 00:40:30.88 His wood chips dust and debris filled the air, the members of RTI Idaho did not need to
00:40:30.88 --> 00:40:32.24 be told what to do.
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:37.56 We kissed mother earth and pressed against her body for all we were worth.
00:40:37.56 --> 00:40:41.96 In the brief quiet that followed, I told Bubba to pair some explosives.
00:40:41.96 --> 00:40:45.000 Just in case we needed to cut down trees at the extraction point.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.32 I told Sau, we needed to head north as that was our only chance for escape.
00:40:49.32 --> 00:40:54.88 No one looked happy with this news, particularly not Sau, who had seen first hand
00:40:54.88 --> 00:40:57.68 what was waiting in that direction.
00:40:57.68 --> 00:41:03.52 About this time, the second sky radar appeared and released its load of 500 pound bombs.
00:41:03.52 --> 00:41:11.44 They were so close that the concussions bounced us like jumping beans.
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:16.48 And this is all based on the yellow smoke that you'd thrown five minutes ago or eight
00:41:16.48 --> 00:41:17.48 minutes ago.
00:41:17.48 --> 00:41:18.48 Right.
00:41:18.48 --> 00:41:22.88 They're looking at a massive, this is another thing that's hard to understand.
00:41:22.88 --> 00:41:27.68 I was a radio man when I was in New Guy and we were out in the desert and we were trying
00:41:27.68 --> 00:41:30.92 to call in helicopters to come pick us up.
00:41:30.92 --> 00:41:31.92 It's me calling him in.
00:41:31.92 --> 00:41:32.92 It's not weed.
00:41:32.92 --> 00:41:36.12 I'm sitting there on the radio trying to call in these helicopters.
00:41:36.12 --> 00:41:39.32 I got my air pan and we're in the desert.
00:41:39.32 --> 00:41:43.12 This isn't true because this is the desert and these helicopters can't see me.
00:41:43.12 --> 00:41:44.12 They're not far.
00:41:44.12 --> 00:41:45.12 They're not out to do.
00:41:45.12 --> 00:41:48.12 They're probably 500 to 500 meters away.
00:41:48.12 --> 00:41:52.20 They're doing an apathy earth or they're looking for us.
00:41:52.20 --> 00:41:54.72 They know we're in the general area and they're looking for us and I'm sitting there with
00:41:54.72 --> 00:41:58.64 a signal panel like trying to get their attention.
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:03.64 And what you don't realize is that you're seeing this helicopter.
00:42:03.64 --> 00:42:04.64 It's so obvious.
00:42:04.64 --> 00:42:07.68 I mean, you'd think there's no possible way that they can't see you.
00:42:07.68 --> 00:42:12.12 You'd think there's no pop where you've got a 16 man seal puttune out there.
00:42:12.12 --> 00:42:16.36 I'm waving around a piece of fluorescent orange where the only human beings in this desert
00:42:16.36 --> 00:42:18.32 and they can't see us.
00:42:18.32 --> 00:42:22.28 And now you're in the reason they can't see us is because they're looking everywhere.
00:42:22.28 --> 00:42:23.76 They're looking at whatever.
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:26.24 What however many square miles they're looking into and ocean.
00:42:26.24 --> 00:42:27.24 They're looking at the desert.
00:42:27.24 --> 00:42:30.04 They can see all this space.
00:42:30.04 --> 00:42:31.04 And so it takes them a while.
00:42:31.04 --> 00:42:32.04 You don't find that.
00:42:32.04 --> 00:42:37.64 I think I popped a smoke and they didn't see the smoke and then I popped another smoke.
00:42:37.64 --> 00:42:45.68 And so I can't imagine these guys are coming in hot, dropping bombs based on where the
00:42:45.68 --> 00:42:51.40 not even the him but where the covey saw smoke five minutes ago.
00:42:51.40 --> 00:42:52.40 Yeah.
00:42:52.40 --> 00:42:57.12 We may have popped another smoke in here somewhere and also I know that I had talked
00:42:57.12 --> 00:42:58.12 to covey.
00:42:58.12 --> 00:43:03.96 Okay, here's our smoke north of us and he knew they had we had a lot of I take north
00:43:03.96 --> 00:43:08.96 in south and if we got about maybe we'll be we're getting from the east but if we're
00:43:08.96 --> 00:43:12.80 talking about trying to get to the north that's why he came across the northern.
00:43:12.80 --> 00:43:16.76 So he knew basically where we were and he came in and it cost a 500 pounds of
00:43:16.76 --> 00:43:20.64 able to get through the jungle and impact on the ground.
00:43:20.64 --> 00:43:22.24 And those things rocked you guys.
00:43:22.24 --> 00:43:23.24 Oh yeah.
00:43:23.24 --> 00:43:29.000 That's one of those happy pains.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000 Yeah.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.92 Good times I guess.
00:43:33.92 --> 00:43:34.92 Tilt.
00:43:34.92 --> 00:43:36.88 All right.
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:42.40 With the A1E activity to occupy us we had momentarily taken our attention away from our
00:43:42.40 --> 00:43:47.28 southern flank and now a wave of NVA hit us from that direction.
00:43:47.28 --> 00:43:53.88 Everyone responded with automatic fire and Bubba and I lob some grenades down the slope.
00:43:53.88 --> 00:43:58.96 I informed covey of the attack and told him that when I gave the word and the team moved
00:43:58.96 --> 00:44:02.88 to the north I wanted more A1E runs to our south.
00:44:02.88 --> 00:44:07.32 In my heart of hearts I also wanted more runs to the north but we didn't have time for
00:44:07.32 --> 00:44:08.32 that.
00:44:08.32 --> 00:44:10.76 We had to get out while the getting was good.
00:44:10.76 --> 00:44:20.68 The next NVA wave could be the one to overrun us.
00:44:20.68 --> 00:44:25.28 As Bubba finished preparing explosives, Hep and I continued rolling grenades downhill
00:44:25.28 --> 00:44:26.76 toward the enemy.
00:44:26.76 --> 00:44:32.60 Saoen folk covered Tuan with car 15 fire as he set up a clay more facing south and covered
00:44:32.60 --> 00:44:33.76 it with leaves.
00:44:33.76 --> 00:44:38.40 A little parting gift for our friends.
00:44:38.40 --> 00:44:39.52 The race was on.
00:44:39.52 --> 00:44:42.56 I gave covey the word and behind us the A1E.
00:44:42.56 --> 00:44:46.04 The A1E is began bombing the shit out of whoever was back there.
00:44:46.04 --> 00:44:47.72 Folk angled back to the north.
00:44:47.72 --> 00:44:51.88 We passed the, we passed bodies of dead NVA soldiers but we didn't have time to stop and
00:44:51.88 --> 00:44:55.68 search them for papers or anything of an intelligence value.
00:44:55.68 --> 00:44:58.000 We had only one fought mind.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000 Get out.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.32 It was something of a miracle that fawking Sao actually located the spot covey had found
00:45:04.32 --> 00:45:05.80 for us.
00:45:05.80 --> 00:45:10.48 When we finally looked up toward the whole itself however, it appeared a long, long ways
00:45:10.48 --> 00:45:11.48 away.
00:45:11.48 --> 00:45:15.20 It was at least a hundred feet or more and the green tunnel leading to it was narrow and
00:45:15.20 --> 00:45:16.20 dangerous.
00:45:16.20 --> 00:45:20.48 As we were approaching, I'd seen the tops of trees being whipped around by the gusting
00:45:20.48 --> 00:45:24.92 wind and knew this would complicate matters even more.
00:45:24.92 --> 00:45:26.56 This was not going to be an easy exit.
00:45:26.56 --> 00:45:27.84 So you guys are moving to this thing.
00:45:27.84 --> 00:45:30.24 You're looking up at the tree tops and you see there's like heavy wind.
00:45:30.24 --> 00:45:32.48 Because that's just a weather wind.
00:45:32.48 --> 00:45:33.48 Like it's wet.
00:45:33.48 --> 00:45:34.48 It's windy out.
00:45:34.48 --> 00:45:39.12 We had weather forecast and it might be some problems with the weather.
00:45:39.12 --> 00:45:43.12 So here we are as dark and I didn't tell the guys.
00:45:43.12 --> 00:45:48.000 I knew that seeing those trees like that, this was a little bit.
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.64 And I was getting late dark.
00:45:50.64 --> 00:45:52.48 I needed your nugs.
00:45:52.48 --> 00:45:53.48 Yeah, you did.
00:45:53.48 --> 00:45:55.48 I wish you could have had them bro.
00:45:55.48 --> 00:45:57.68 And we're going to totally change this whole scenario.
00:45:57.68 --> 00:46:00.36 Because the helicopter, because the aircraft too.
00:46:00.36 --> 00:46:01.36 Sure.
00:46:01.36 --> 00:46:02.92 Because the aircraft would be, oh yeah, we got you.
00:46:02.92 --> 00:46:06.80 We got you locked and we'll just, you guys can just pitch a ten.
00:46:06.80 --> 00:46:07.80 Pick the first one.
00:46:07.80 --> 00:46:12.08 Pick the first one.
00:46:12.08 --> 00:46:18.12 And the NVA, this still, you know, the big motto of the insurgents, right, is that they
00:46:18.12 --> 00:46:20.92 only fight when they want to and they don't have to fight if they don't need to.
00:46:20.92 --> 00:46:29.92 And you don't imagine troops that don't have to fight, just keep coming after you.
00:46:29.92 --> 00:46:34.16 Just keep, you're laying waste on, but they keep coming.
00:46:34.16 --> 00:46:40.92 That must to be the value of capturing you all cross border would be so high that they
00:46:40.92 --> 00:46:45.36 just must have had serious intent to try and capture.
00:46:45.36 --> 00:46:49.56 Well yeah, and then too, you know, you had that propaganda they've been fed for all those
00:46:49.56 --> 00:46:50.56 years.
00:46:50.56 --> 00:46:55.40 They really believed that like the French, we were there to occupy.
00:46:55.40 --> 00:47:01.12 So we're just there was combatting communism, but they never hurt any of that stuff.
00:47:01.12 --> 00:47:02.12 And they were dedicated.
00:47:02.12 --> 00:47:06.92 That's absolutely, yes, sir.
00:47:06.92 --> 00:47:09.92 Back to the book, the NVA had not given up.
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:14.12 Its troops were hot on our tail, even though we had heard Tuan's claim or go off and
00:47:14.12 --> 00:47:17.92 had listened to the A1E's work them over.
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:20.04 You had to hand it to the NVA soldiers.
00:47:20.04 --> 00:47:22.32 They were very tough and determined.
00:47:22.32 --> 00:47:31.12 I again contacted Kovie and asked for some tactical air command air support to our rear.
00:47:31.12 --> 00:47:35.88 And in a matter of minutes, bombs were falling and cannons were blasting away.
00:47:35.88 --> 00:47:40.76 I'm sure I was impressed with the service as the NVA were surprised by how quickly the
00:47:40.76 --> 00:47:42.76 ordinance had been delivered.
00:47:42.76 --> 00:47:44.64 They were learning less in the hard way.
00:47:44.64 --> 00:47:49.52 If a recon team wasn't wiped out in the first few minutes of the fight, the NVA would
00:47:49.52 --> 00:47:57.04 pay dearly for the mistake, but more than one NVA unit had experienced this firsthand.
00:47:57.04 --> 00:48:02.60 So that's kind of a critical few minutes as long as it's long to take for air to get
00:48:02.60 --> 00:48:03.60 on station usually.
00:48:03.60 --> 00:48:05.40 Well, it depends every time.
00:48:05.40 --> 00:48:11.56 Several hours to, in this case, we were fortunate to make contact really early on with
00:48:11.56 --> 00:48:17.44 Kovie, who fortunately had A1E's that were within a few minutes away.
00:48:17.44 --> 00:48:19.04 So there were some lock involved.
00:48:19.04 --> 00:48:20.04 Very much.
00:48:20.04 --> 00:48:23.12 I mean, we solved them, had that kind of response and lay us.
00:48:23.12 --> 00:48:27.12 Did you ever pre-plan to have coverage at certain times?
00:48:27.12 --> 00:48:28.76 It would be a special mission.
00:48:28.76 --> 00:48:33.92 Like the ones we put in the sensors, you put them in and you're going to be an account
00:48:33.92 --> 00:48:35.44 for two or three hours.
00:48:35.44 --> 00:48:38.52 He booked the times, had the asset set.
00:48:38.52 --> 00:48:42.56 So we have to go or something happens in between being you think come in.
00:48:42.56 --> 00:48:48.96 But most of the time, were these aircraft necessarily briefed on the mission?
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:49.96 That's self.
00:48:49.96 --> 00:48:51.56 So do they know coming in?
00:48:51.56 --> 00:48:52.68 Hey, this is the a.o.
00:48:52.68 --> 00:48:53.68 That they're working.
00:48:53.68 --> 00:48:54.68 Oh, these guys just coming in.
00:48:54.68 --> 00:48:56.68 They were just random pilots.
00:48:56.68 --> 00:48:58.000 It would be both.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.12 They had specific A1 units in the Air Force in that timeframe that were specifically
00:49:05.12 --> 00:49:11.96 their for sog missions and SAR, search and rescue up north for any down pilots.
00:49:11.96 --> 00:49:18.64 So they were very much attuned to our people, working with contune and with us up north.
00:49:18.64 --> 00:49:23.64 So they knew everything was in the Prairie Fire A.
00:49:23.64 --> 00:49:30.60 Sometimes when we were in Echo 4, our first contact was with a fighter jet that heard the
00:49:30.60 --> 00:49:34.96 Erkten beeper and responded to that.
00:49:34.96 --> 00:49:39.24 So another mission is another aircraft would hear it.
00:49:39.24 --> 00:49:46.04 And if they had an ordinance, then we had to get the myriad, get them locate and find
00:49:46.04 --> 00:49:51.92 us and bring in the ordinance while he put the call out to get the cover or the Hillsboro
00:49:51.92 --> 00:49:58.60 or Moonbeam, to let the node head a tactical emergency going on here.
00:49:58.60 --> 00:50:01.96 And you're doing all that on the radio while you're still fighting.
00:50:01.96 --> 00:50:07.28 Yeah, we had to spend a few rounds there.
00:50:07.28 --> 00:50:09.28 Lighten the load.
00:50:09.28 --> 00:50:15.22 All right, Bubba, Sout and Falk had been busy placing explosive charges on trees while
00:50:15.22 --> 00:50:17.96 hepp and Tuan set out claim worse facing south.
00:50:17.96 --> 00:50:25.02 I couldn't help but shake my head in wonder at hepp in a dark jungle with night approaching.
00:50:25.02 --> 00:50:28.14 He still had his ever present sunglasses.
00:50:28.14 --> 00:50:31.78 We blew the charges around the trees and they were cut clean, but the dense jungle refused
00:50:31.78 --> 00:50:33.54 to let them fall.
00:50:33.54 --> 00:50:35.98 We had not succeeded in making the whole any bigger.
00:50:35.98 --> 00:50:40.74 So we just have to hope the rescue ships could manage to drop the ropes down to us and
00:50:40.74 --> 00:50:42.26 then pray the ropes were long enough.
00:50:42.26 --> 00:50:46.06 So you're trying to make that hole in the jungle a little bit bigger.
00:50:46.06 --> 00:50:49.06 Like what diameter is this hole that you're looking at?
00:50:49.06 --> 00:50:52.86 Oh, this is like 10 meters is it not that.
00:50:52.86 --> 00:50:54.78 You know, it's a good question.
00:50:54.78 --> 00:50:55.78 Maybe 20, 30 meters.
00:50:55.78 --> 00:50:56.78 Okay.
00:50:56.78 --> 00:50:58.18 At the most, but there's trees in it.
00:50:58.18 --> 00:50:59.18 Yeah.
00:50:59.18 --> 00:51:04.34 No, it's, this is a little bit more open as opposed to just triple canopy enclosed where
00:51:04.34 --> 00:51:06.26 you're just completely, we could see skylight.
00:51:06.26 --> 00:51:08.26 You could literally see the sky.
00:51:08.26 --> 00:51:10.98 But and then you try and blow some of the trees.
00:51:10.98 --> 00:51:12.86 They don't even fall down because there's too much jungle.
00:51:12.86 --> 00:51:13.86 Two lines.
00:51:13.86 --> 00:51:14.86 Yeah, two.
00:51:14.86 --> 00:51:15.86 Two trees.
00:51:15.86 --> 00:51:16.86 It doesn't even help.
00:51:16.86 --> 00:51:17.86 Good.
00:51:17.86 --> 00:51:18.86 Dimes.
00:51:18.86 --> 00:51:22.10 And to the frustration.
00:51:22.10 --> 00:51:27.30 We tried to blow up some palm trees or actually was leaf, leafs, puttune, tried to blow
00:51:27.30 --> 00:51:32.74 up some palm trees that were obstructing their view in a Overwatch position.
00:51:32.74 --> 00:51:33.74 Right.
00:51:33.74 --> 00:51:37.10 And they blew up.
00:51:37.10 --> 00:51:40.22 They said they sit so many charges on these palm trees.
00:51:40.22 --> 00:51:41.22 It was embarrassing.
00:51:41.22 --> 00:51:42.22 I got rung.
00:51:42.22 --> 00:51:43.22 I got rung.
00:51:43.22 --> 00:51:44.22 No, they weren't.
00:51:44.22 --> 00:51:45.22 They didn't budge.
00:51:45.22 --> 00:51:46.22 No, I got embarrassed.
00:51:46.22 --> 00:51:48.94 I'm sitting there telling the batiling commander.
00:51:48.94 --> 00:51:51.42 He's saying, well, I'm saying, Heather, sir, there's going to be another controlled
00:51:51.42 --> 00:51:52.42 debt and boom.
00:51:52.42 --> 00:51:54.90 And then something's going to be another controlled debt and then boom.
00:51:54.90 --> 00:51:57.02 And then something's going to be another controlled debt and then boom.
00:51:57.02 --> 00:51:58.42 He said, what are they doing?
00:51:58.42 --> 00:51:59.42 I said, it's a good word.
00:51:59.42 --> 00:52:00.42 It's a palm tree.
00:52:00.42 --> 00:52:01.42 He's don't worry about it.
00:52:01.42 --> 00:52:02.42 You know, what's there?
00:52:02.42 --> 00:52:03.42 We're just going to leave those palm trees.
00:52:03.42 --> 00:52:06.22 Yeah, the score right now is palm trees three seals.
00:52:06.22 --> 00:52:08.22 Yeah, that's what happened.
00:52:08.22 --> 00:52:11.42 Oh, no, those palm trees are hard.
00:52:11.42 --> 00:52:12.42 Resilient.
00:52:12.42 --> 00:52:13.42 Thick.
00:52:13.42 --> 00:52:14.42 All right.
00:52:14.42 --> 00:52:15.42 Back to the book.
00:52:15.42 --> 00:52:18.22 With the helicopters on their final approach, I threw out another smoke grenade
00:52:18.22 --> 00:52:22.18 to mark our location and the rest of the team began firing at the NVA who had again
00:52:22.18 --> 00:52:23.58 pressed in on us.
00:52:23.58 --> 00:52:28.46 We could barely make out their shadows, but they were definitely out there as evidence
00:52:28.46 --> 00:52:31.66 by the green trace around flying towards us.
00:52:31.66 --> 00:52:34.26 Covey hadn't been able to see my smoke.
00:52:34.26 --> 00:52:36.30 So he asked for a pen flare.
00:52:36.30 --> 00:52:38.34 And I tried to fire it up through the trees.
00:52:38.34 --> 00:52:40.94 It struck a limb and bounced back.
00:52:40.94 --> 00:52:45.62 Being desperate, I told Covey I was going to shoot three trace around, red trace around
00:52:45.62 --> 00:52:47.18 up through the hole.
00:52:47.18 --> 00:52:50.86 And before he could scream, no, I had pulled the trigger on my car 15.
00:52:50.86 --> 00:52:55.62 I immediately realized what a dangerous move it was as I saw him pass overhead.
00:52:55.62 --> 00:53:00.38 In case there was any doubt in my mind, Covey took the time to let me know in no unsuit
00:53:00.38 --> 00:53:02.14 in terms how stupid I was.
00:53:02.14 --> 00:53:06.94 I believe the expressions dumb asked and shit for brains came into play.
00:53:06.94 --> 00:53:09.58 Well, me.
00:53:09.58 --> 00:53:10.82 So you're in this situation.
00:53:10.82 --> 00:53:13.22 He still took the time to call you shit for brains.
00:53:13.22 --> 00:53:15.66 You're about to die.
00:53:15.66 --> 00:53:18.46 Pry, oh man.
00:53:18.46 --> 00:53:19.46 Yeah.
00:53:19.46 --> 00:53:20.46 And you know what's thinking?
00:53:20.46 --> 00:53:21.46 I never fought in Afghanistan.
00:53:21.46 --> 00:53:22.46 I don't know what they had.
00:53:22.46 --> 00:53:24.46 I don't know if they saw a lot of more green traceers over there.
00:53:24.46 --> 00:53:29.54 I'll have to ask some of them and buddies and never really thought about that.
00:53:29.54 --> 00:53:32.74 So that's a, was that just like the normal little pencil flare?
00:53:32.74 --> 00:53:33.74 Yes.
00:53:33.74 --> 00:53:34.74 A little trigger thing.
00:53:34.74 --> 00:53:35.74 You put crink.
00:53:35.74 --> 00:53:37.98 It's always like a 22 round that fires up its tracer.
00:53:37.98 --> 00:53:38.98 Yes.
00:53:38.98 --> 00:53:40.70 I didn't penetrate through.
00:53:40.70 --> 00:53:44.42 So you decide you're just going to fire the car.
00:53:44.42 --> 00:53:45.90 But all my tracers.
00:53:45.90 --> 00:53:46.90 But they saw him, right?
00:53:46.90 --> 00:53:47.90 They did.
00:53:47.90 --> 00:53:48.90 Yeah.
00:53:48.90 --> 00:53:53.06 So, hey, one for till.
00:53:53.06 --> 00:53:56.74 Just before the rescue choppers attempted to hover and drop the ropes, I told Covey I wanted
00:53:56.74 --> 00:54:01.38 the gunships that accompanied them to work over the area around us, particularly to the south.
00:54:01.38 --> 00:54:05.14 I wanted the NVA to be either dead wounded or with their heads buried in the ground, who
00:54:05.14 --> 00:54:06.98 we tried to make our escape.
00:54:06.98 --> 00:54:12.94 The muskets, the men from the 176 assault helicopter company immediately went to work
00:54:12.94 --> 00:54:19.62 with their 2.75 inch rockets and their gattling like mini guns, multi-barled weapons that
00:54:19.62 --> 00:54:23.62 could pump 6,000 rounds of 7,6 to a minute.
00:54:23.62 --> 00:54:28.02 As the last rocket hit and exploded behind us, the first 100 first airborne division
00:54:28.02 --> 00:54:32.14 slick appeared over the hole in the jungle roof and dropped sandbags with ropes attached
00:54:32.14 --> 00:54:33.14 to them.
00:54:33.14 --> 00:54:38.14 The helicopter was so high up that looked like a toy and even its powerful rotor wash
00:54:38.14 --> 00:54:39.86 couldn't reach us.
00:54:39.86 --> 00:54:43.58 I could tell he wasn't being buffeted by the wind, but he had somehow managed to hold
00:54:43.58 --> 00:54:45.78 steady over the opening.
00:54:45.78 --> 00:54:49.82 One of the sandbags attached to the rope had a strobe light attached to it and we watched
00:54:49.82 --> 00:54:53.30 it bounce off the limbs as it fell toward us.
00:54:53.30 --> 00:54:59.82 You guys I guess they had invented the jungle penetrator yet.
00:54:59.82 --> 00:55:02.38 They have but not on UEs.
00:55:02.38 --> 00:55:05.66 They had them on the HH3s and the job means giant.
00:55:05.66 --> 00:55:10.70 Yeah, for the other reason, they don't know it's like a big metal, yeah, jungle penetrator.
00:55:10.70 --> 00:55:13.38 It's a big metal kind of spear almost.
00:55:13.38 --> 00:55:19.18 And they've still able to talk to a crane and it just drops down and that weight and
00:55:19.18 --> 00:55:20.34 it's well shaped.
00:55:20.34 --> 00:55:26.02 As opposed to just a random sandbag bouncing in here.
00:55:26.02 --> 00:55:30.86 And so this thing was hot, this thing must have been like 150 feet up.
00:55:30.86 --> 00:55:33.86 Yeah, they had the longest ropes in there.
00:55:33.86 --> 00:55:39.10 Surprise even got down to us.
00:55:39.10 --> 00:55:42.86 Back to the book while we kept an eye on the ropes descending through the trees, the NVA mounted
00:55:42.86 --> 00:55:44.98 a desperate last charge towards us.
00:55:44.98 --> 00:55:50.58 We walked along and hept, triggered their claymores and the rest of us opened up with all we had.
00:55:50.58 --> 00:55:55.86 Somehow in the midst of all the tumultuous activity, the four in-ditch had managed to rig
00:55:55.86 --> 00:56:00.14 themselves a Swiss seat using the six foot long pieces of rope we carried just for that
00:56:00.14 --> 00:56:01.14 purpose.
00:56:01.14 --> 00:56:05.26 Bubba and I now tried to do the same but it wasn't easy to wrap a rope around my waist,
00:56:05.26 --> 00:56:09.78 pass it between my legs and then finish tying it off on the right hip while under fire.
00:56:09.78 --> 00:56:15.58 We managed to do it while the inditch held off the enemy and began to hook up for the left
00:56:15.58 --> 00:56:16.58 out.
00:56:16.58 --> 00:56:23.98 If you guys ever think about using some kind of pre-rigged like sit harness or something,
00:56:23.98 --> 00:56:27.02 they were developing those at the time.
00:56:27.02 --> 00:56:32.46 They upgraded the head like the McGuire rig, which is just basically a thick material
00:56:32.46 --> 00:56:37.10 that you could sit in and hook in and then later it came out with the rig.
00:56:37.10 --> 00:56:42.54 I can't think of name but it was an outfit where you had your harness built in.
00:56:42.54 --> 00:56:47.30 You had to web gear with the harness so when it came down you just hook in.
00:56:47.30 --> 00:56:48.30 Click in you ready?
00:56:48.30 --> 00:56:50.30 I'd be thinking about that in a single while.
00:56:50.30 --> 00:56:51.30 It's a lot.
00:56:51.30 --> 00:56:55.30 When I found this you tried to tie a Swiss seat.
00:56:55.30 --> 00:57:00.78 Yeah, that's awesome.
00:57:00.78 --> 00:57:03.62 We were getting low on ammunition, grenades and claymores.
00:57:03.62 --> 00:57:06.62 If we didn't make it out, it was going to be a very long night.
00:57:06.62 --> 00:57:11.62 In fact, I wasn't sure if we could survive the night no matter what kind of air support
00:57:11.62 --> 00:57:13.06 man is to reach us.
00:57:13.06 --> 00:57:15.94 It was now or never.
00:57:15.94 --> 00:57:21.30 Sound fork located three of the four ropes and it attached themselves to one of them using
00:57:21.30 --> 00:57:22.66 snap links.
00:57:22.66 --> 00:57:26.58 When I asked a cubby if the chopper could lift us all out of once, he replied, no way, it's
00:57:26.58 --> 00:57:28.50 going to take two lifts.
00:57:28.50 --> 00:57:31.14 No way is exactly what I thought in return.
00:57:31.14 --> 00:57:33.98 There was no way we had enough time for two attempts.
00:57:33.98 --> 00:57:36.30 There was no way I was going to split the team.
00:57:36.30 --> 00:57:39.42 Either all six of us were going out together on four ropes.
00:57:39.42 --> 00:57:42.50 Oh, we were going to die together trying.
00:57:42.50 --> 00:57:46.22 Call it camaraderie or fear, but I was not going to leave anyone.
00:57:46.22 --> 00:57:50.14 Myself included on the ground for a minute longer than necessary.
00:57:50.14 --> 00:57:55.30 I'd heard all the horror stories I needed to about what could result in and I didn't want
00:57:55.30 --> 00:58:00.34 to be the subject of some gruesome tale around the bar at F.O.B.1.
00:58:00.34 --> 00:58:05.10 I suddenly had a bright idea and asked Bubba if he still had the claim or with the white
00:58:05.10 --> 00:58:07.78 phosphorus grenade taped to its front.
00:58:07.78 --> 00:58:12.46 When he nodded, yes, I told him to strap it as high as he could as high as he could reach
00:58:12.46 --> 00:58:14.74 on a nearby tree facing south.
00:58:14.74 --> 00:58:17.34 He gave me his best, are you out of your fucking mind?
00:58:17.34 --> 00:58:25.82 Look, because he knew at that proximity, the back blast would kill us all when we set it off.
00:58:25.82 --> 00:58:28.78 So he hesitated and I had to order him to do it.
00:58:28.78 --> 00:58:32.70 As he finished the remaining two little people paired up and hooked themselves onto into
00:58:32.70 --> 00:58:36.86 one of the ropes while Bubba and I each took one of the remaining two.
00:58:36.86 --> 00:58:40.70 I wanted to balance out the weight distribution by having me on one side of the helicopter
00:58:40.70 --> 00:58:45.18 and Bubba on the other, but it was impossible to tell for sure which ropes went where.
00:58:45.18 --> 00:58:48.54 So I took a wild guess and hoped for the best.
00:58:48.54 --> 00:58:49.54 Best.
00:58:49.54 --> 00:58:54.30 Using the barrel of my M79 to shield the flash from the NVA, I used a strobe like to signal
00:58:54.30 --> 00:58:58.74 the chopper to begin lifting us out.
00:58:58.74 --> 00:59:01.26 Did the chopper have enough power?
00:59:01.26 --> 00:59:03.30 Would we be dragged through the trees?
00:59:03.30 --> 00:59:08.38 Would the NVA manage to shoot one or all of us out of our saddles?
00:59:08.38 --> 00:59:11.78 We were about to find out.
00:59:11.78 --> 00:59:17.82 As the ropes became taught, fire, gunfire erupted from the west, south, fucking, I returned,
00:59:17.82 --> 00:59:23.38 fire, but our bodies blocked the others line of sight so they watched in frustration.
00:59:23.38 --> 00:59:27.50 Because my rope was longer than the other three, I was the last to leave the ground.
00:59:27.50 --> 00:59:33.86 This also gave me the additional seconds I needed to reload my empty car 15 twice.
00:59:33.86 --> 00:59:38.90 Things were happening very fast almost too fast and my bright idea demanded perfect timing
00:59:38.90 --> 00:59:44.62 as we started up, Bubba reached out and ignited the delay flues on the delay fuse on the
00:59:44.62 --> 00:59:48.74 last claim or the one he'd fastened to the tree.
00:59:48.74 --> 00:59:53.50 With my feet dangling in the air, I fired around for my M79.
00:59:53.50 --> 00:59:58.78 Still gaining altitude, I then pulled the pins on two hand grenades and tossed them down
00:59:58.78 --> 01:00:03.50 onto the ground at about the same time that claim more went off.
01:00:03.50 --> 01:00:09.74 The back blast blew under us, but we could still feel it's power and heat.
01:00:09.74 --> 01:00:15.78 The phosphorus was like a giant flash bulb going off, and that frozen instant of illumination
01:00:15.78 --> 01:00:18.94 I could finally see the faces of my enemy.
01:00:18.94 --> 01:00:20.86 They were hurting.
01:00:20.86 --> 01:00:23.26 But still advancing.
01:00:23.26 --> 01:00:28.42 The engine screaming, the Huey somehow came up with the power it needed.
01:00:28.42 --> 01:00:33.30 It was agonizingly slow going and we had to push our way through some branches, but we
01:00:33.30 --> 01:00:35.42 were not being dragged through them.
01:00:35.42 --> 01:00:37.82 We were being lifted straight up.
01:00:37.82 --> 01:00:43.86 The NVA continued to fire at us and I had the unsettling impression that trace around
01:00:43.86 --> 01:00:50.62 for passing between my legs and sensation that will give any man pause for thought.
01:00:50.62 --> 01:00:55.86 The team fired back on full automatic and we threw the last of our grenades.
01:00:55.86 --> 01:01:02.98 Like two fiercely-demented and determined beasts, the NVA and RT Idaho remain locked in battle
01:01:02.98 --> 01:01:05.54 to the bitter end.
01:01:05.54 --> 01:01:09.74 As we finally cleared the trees, I immediately called Kovie and confessed our little
01:01:09.74 --> 01:01:10.74 deception.
01:01:10.74 --> 01:01:12.38 The team is out.
01:01:12.38 --> 01:01:14.94 The whole team is out, I screamed into the handset.
01:01:14.94 --> 01:01:18.30 We came out together, do not send in a second helicopter.
01:01:18.30 --> 01:01:21.98 I repeat, no second chopper.
01:01:21.98 --> 01:01:24.58 The muskets rolled in and pulverize the ground.
01:01:24.58 --> 01:01:25.58 We had just left.
01:01:25.58 --> 01:01:31.26 The A1Es were right behind them and as the muffled explosion and light flashes reached
01:01:31.26 --> 01:01:36.18 me, I found myself feeling a little sorry for the NVA troops down there.
01:01:36.18 --> 01:01:39.62 They were valiant and dedicated soldiers.
01:01:39.62 --> 01:01:43.54 They would have to be a credit to any army.
01:01:43.54 --> 01:01:47.50 Those left alive would no doubt have some stories to tell.
01:01:47.50 --> 01:01:52.06 And I doubted that they would ever admit that a six-man team had held them at bay for so
01:01:52.06 --> 01:01:58.14 long and then escaped their most determined efforts to wipe them out.
01:01:58.14 --> 01:02:04.02 As for RT Idaho, we were simply happy to be alive.
01:02:04.02 --> 01:02:09.02 Not something I would have bet on a short while earlier.
01:02:09.02 --> 01:02:17.90 Oh yeah.
01:02:17.90 --> 01:02:19.34 We were lucky too because of the...
01:02:19.34 --> 01:02:23.58 It was more or more lucky than that.
01:02:23.58 --> 01:02:26.30 We used to hold a lot of luck on that one.
01:02:26.30 --> 01:02:34.90 But we were still relatively high and not like the big peaks and deeper into layoffs.
01:02:34.90 --> 01:02:37.62 So the helicopter was able to pull us out.
01:02:37.62 --> 01:02:44.46 If that had been in the middle of the day and with jungle heat and heat of the day, he never
01:02:44.46 --> 01:02:47.22 would have been able to live six of us out.
01:02:47.22 --> 01:02:50.30 But we weighed all that and I did not listen to the cub.
01:02:50.30 --> 01:02:55.66 We just rolled the dice because it was so dark at that point.
01:02:55.66 --> 01:03:00.34 So oh yeah, the recon guide's smoth on us one more time.
01:03:00.34 --> 01:03:01.34 So when you...
01:03:01.34 --> 01:03:05.18 Once you got pulled out, would they just look for a clearing somewhere to set down, get
01:03:05.18 --> 01:03:07.14 you guys in the helicopter for real?
01:03:07.14 --> 01:03:12.42 No that's the part that they just froze your balls all the way home.
01:03:12.42 --> 01:03:16.94 Because with the Swiss season out, it was just everything goes numb.
01:03:16.94 --> 01:03:21.26 And so because it was dark, particularly they wanted to make sure they were ready to
01:03:21.26 --> 01:03:22.26 put us down.
01:03:22.26 --> 01:03:23.66 It was going to be somewhere in South Vietnam.
01:03:23.66 --> 01:03:24.66 So we were in the air.
01:03:24.66 --> 01:03:27.98 I just figured how long and they finally set us down.
01:03:27.98 --> 01:03:28.98 But you can't walk.
01:03:28.98 --> 01:03:31.82 You lie to like a triple for a few minutes.
01:03:31.82 --> 01:03:32.82 Yeah.
01:03:32.82 --> 01:03:33.82 On clip, you can't flip.
01:03:33.82 --> 01:03:37.74 So they didn't really care about your comfort.
01:03:37.74 --> 01:03:38.74 No.
01:03:38.74 --> 01:03:40.74 And we didn't clean too much.
01:03:40.74 --> 01:03:42.78 But you go, you're all sweaty.
01:03:42.78 --> 01:03:43.78 And you held it.
01:03:43.78 --> 01:03:46.54 Five minutes later, you're a 5000 feet, which is cold.
01:03:46.54 --> 01:03:49.38 People get how cold it is at 5000 feet.
01:03:49.38 --> 01:03:50.38 Yeah, you're freezing.
01:03:50.38 --> 01:03:52.34 Yeah, especially because you're soaking wet.
01:03:52.34 --> 01:03:55.06 And you're going 80 miles an hour.
01:03:55.06 --> 01:03:57.90 So you go 80 mile an hour a wind.
01:03:57.90 --> 01:04:01.90 All that too.
01:04:01.90 --> 01:04:06.14 And this is just, I mean, this is crazy.
01:04:06.14 --> 01:04:09.82 It's absolutely crazy.
01:04:09.82 --> 01:04:12.70 And this was just over and over again.
01:04:12.70 --> 01:04:20.26 Now, you know, I spent a lot of time on the books on the last couple podcasts.
01:04:20.26 --> 01:04:25.10 I wanted to kind of just ask you a couple questions.
01:04:25.10 --> 01:04:28.62 Get your thoughts on some stuff.
01:04:28.62 --> 01:04:30.82 And I also, and I don't know, we might have to come back again.
01:04:30.82 --> 01:04:32.02 And I got sawed chronicles here.
01:04:32.02 --> 01:04:34.38 I read that outstanding book.
01:04:34.38 --> 01:04:38.34 And this is sawed chronicles real quick.
01:04:38.34 --> 01:04:43.46 Talks about a big operation that took place, that you weren't on.
01:04:43.46 --> 01:04:46.86 But you got really good descriptions and talked to people.
01:04:46.86 --> 01:04:48.18 Operation tailwind.
01:04:48.18 --> 01:04:51.70 That's another one where helicopters are getting shot down.
01:04:51.70 --> 01:04:55.34 I mean, it's completely insane.
01:04:55.34 --> 01:04:57.46 Yeah, and no ordinary.
01:04:57.46 --> 01:04:59.90 He looked these are the CH53s.
01:04:59.90 --> 01:05:00.90 They're not the models.
01:05:00.90 --> 01:05:01.90 Yeah.
01:05:01.90 --> 01:05:03.34 The biggest Marine Corps had.
01:05:03.34 --> 01:05:04.66 And they took out two of those.
01:05:04.66 --> 01:05:07.82 I think left one really banged up.
01:05:07.82 --> 01:05:12.62 And when they inserted, they still, they had three WAs on their assertion.
01:05:12.62 --> 01:05:17.82 But they had to get in for that to take the pressure off of the CIA operation.
01:05:17.82 --> 01:05:19.78 That was the mission, September 1970.
01:05:19.78 --> 01:05:20.78 Yeah.
01:05:20.78 --> 01:05:22.94 So that's Operation tailwind.
01:05:22.94 --> 01:05:23.94 Operation tailwind.
01:05:23.94 --> 01:05:26.82 And that book saw chronicles volume one.
01:05:26.82 --> 01:05:30.02 And I hope there's going to be about 30 more volumes of sawed.
01:05:30.02 --> 01:05:33.82 We're going to be working on the model that Anne and I came up with is that we're going
01:05:33.82 --> 01:05:35.02 to write till we die.
01:05:35.02 --> 01:05:36.02 I like it.
01:05:36.02 --> 01:05:39.70 Because there's so many saws stories that there have been told could we couldn't tell.
01:05:39.70 --> 01:05:40.70 And so many of our guys.
01:05:40.70 --> 01:05:44.42 I mean, even when I, a fellow recon guy, talked to him.
01:05:44.42 --> 01:05:46.26 It's like pulling information on him.
01:05:46.26 --> 01:05:48.34 I'm sure you've run into that with your people.
01:05:48.34 --> 01:05:51.06 They're not, they're not inclined to talk.
01:05:51.06 --> 01:05:52.06 Well, yeah.
01:05:52.06 --> 01:05:53.06 They're modest.
01:05:53.06 --> 01:05:56.22 That's an interesting thing because people do not want to be at the bar.
01:05:56.22 --> 01:05:57.22 Yeah.
01:05:57.22 --> 01:05:58.78 I'm a green beret or a machine.
01:05:58.78 --> 01:06:03.34 And most of the guys, when people say, well, you should have more guys from to you
01:06:03.34 --> 01:06:04.34 bruiser on there.
01:06:04.34 --> 01:06:06.38 You have to have more guys more seals on.
01:06:06.38 --> 01:06:08.70 The seals that I know that I would want to have on a lot of them.
01:06:08.70 --> 01:06:09.70 They're still in.
01:06:09.70 --> 01:06:10.70 Or they don't want to come on.
01:06:10.70 --> 01:06:11.70 That's it.
01:06:11.70 --> 01:06:12.70 They won't say it.
01:06:12.70 --> 01:06:13.70 Yeah.
01:06:13.70 --> 01:06:15.50 They're like, hey, I'm good.
01:06:15.50 --> 01:06:19.22 And then obviously, I got a lot of my friends that do come on.
01:06:19.22 --> 01:06:21.46 And it's great when they come on.
01:06:21.46 --> 01:06:25.02 But yeah, a lot of guys are still doing it.
01:06:25.02 --> 01:06:27.34 And so, hey, that's the way it is.
01:06:27.34 --> 01:06:30.42 Once those guys retire, and I do have some friends that are retired soon, and they're
01:06:30.42 --> 01:06:31.42 become what I'm on.
01:06:31.42 --> 01:06:32.42 So that's pretty awesome.
01:06:32.42 --> 01:06:33.42 Oh, yeah.
01:06:33.42 --> 01:06:34.42 But yeah.
01:06:34.42 --> 01:06:39.98 So the song Chronicles, you've, like I said, hopefully there's 30 volumes that right
01:06:39.98 --> 01:06:40.98 now there's just one.
01:06:40.98 --> 01:06:45.66 We're going to try to turn across the fence and on a ground into audio books.
01:06:45.66 --> 01:06:46.66 That's awesome.
01:06:46.66 --> 01:06:47.66 That's our project right now.
01:06:47.66 --> 01:06:53.06 And then as soon as we're done with that, it commenced with volume two.
01:06:53.06 --> 01:06:55.38 And we got a couple of stories there.
01:06:55.38 --> 01:07:01.50 What a one that we talked about in on the ground, the August 23 attack.
01:07:01.50 --> 01:07:03.22 We've had a lot more research.
01:07:03.22 --> 01:07:08.46 We had the scale who's a, as she was in M.I. and she has pulled out more information.
01:07:08.46 --> 01:07:12.54 She's going to pull the whole thing together for the, hopefully the most detailed story
01:07:12.54 --> 01:07:17.30 in the night because we're such a tragic, yet heroic night for the people that were there
01:07:17.30 --> 01:07:18.30 on the ground in night.
01:07:18.30 --> 01:07:20.98 And Larry Trimble up on Marble Mountain.
01:07:20.98 --> 01:07:21.98 Yeah.
01:07:21.98 --> 01:07:24.74 And that couple of the stories, many other stories.
01:07:24.74 --> 01:07:27.10 But there's the other one.
01:07:27.10 --> 01:07:33.78 One of our guys went in for a bright light and they got shot out at a, at four
01:07:33.78 --> 01:07:35.50 crass.
01:07:35.50 --> 01:07:40.78 As it was crashing, you hit three separate hill tops coming to rest on a third one.
01:07:40.78 --> 01:07:45.10 They got to the second hill and got shot out.
01:07:45.10 --> 01:07:47.74 He went back 25 years later.
01:07:47.74 --> 01:07:55.18 He became a doctor on his own money spent $70,000 to go back to Cambodia to try to find
01:07:55.18 --> 01:07:58.54 that effort just nodded his conscience.
01:07:58.54 --> 01:08:03.26 They got in, got to the site and we're run off by bandits.
01:08:03.26 --> 01:08:07.74 He went back now, would be two years ago, with DPA.
01:08:07.74 --> 01:08:13.06 And DPA was working on the second hill where the jet was on the third hill.
01:08:13.06 --> 01:08:18.98 So he's able to go in to give them direct sighting as to where the dig.
01:08:18.98 --> 01:08:22.30 So there's still work and he was on the ground digging things out with these guys.
01:08:22.30 --> 01:08:23.58 That's going to be a netbook.
01:08:23.58 --> 01:08:24.58 Yeah.
01:08:24.58 --> 01:08:28.18 So check out that book too.
01:08:28.18 --> 01:08:30.74 Saw Chronicles.
01:08:30.74 --> 01:08:33.10 You're training.
01:08:33.10 --> 01:08:36.26 How ready do you think you were when you got to Vietnam?
01:08:36.26 --> 01:08:41.38 How ready for you for what you were about to encounter?
01:08:41.38 --> 01:08:45.78 Well, a lot better than the guys that went through just basic training and advanced infantry
01:08:45.78 --> 01:08:46.78 training.
01:08:46.78 --> 01:08:50.62 And I'm sure that commencement units had in country training.
01:08:50.62 --> 01:08:53.50 Our in country training was good.
01:08:53.50 --> 01:08:54.50 He worked.
01:08:54.50 --> 01:09:00.82 We practiced calling in spooky, worked with the helicopters, told about the dangers and working
01:09:00.82 --> 01:09:06.22 with the little people, the history as well as some of the do's and don'ts about working
01:09:06.22 --> 01:09:09.14 with South Vietnamese.
01:09:09.14 --> 01:09:15.26 I thought that was good, but then to just no aid camp duty, I think all that was geared
01:09:15.26 --> 01:09:17.30 for the aid camps.
01:09:17.30 --> 01:09:19.38 Sog was just at another level.
01:09:19.38 --> 01:09:20.70 And that's why we always talked.
01:09:20.70 --> 01:09:26.74 So people like Pat Watkins by the parks, John McGovern, Dick Gross, they were the senior
01:09:26.74 --> 01:09:28.82 e7s or e6s in camp.
01:09:28.82 --> 01:09:31.38 All of whom had run at night.
01:09:31.38 --> 01:09:35.22 A screen guys would talk to them, particularly after mission.
01:09:35.22 --> 01:09:36.98 And then we talked to each other.
01:09:36.98 --> 01:09:43.82 You know, John Watten came back from a target and where Tom Cunney-Hemp's leg was blown
01:09:43.82 --> 01:09:44.82 off.
01:09:44.82 --> 01:09:48.58 One of those little people who got shot four times and captain 10 who saved us and knocked
01:09:48.58 --> 01:09:51.18 over, pulled them out and August.
01:09:51.18 --> 01:09:52.98 And we talked right away.
01:09:52.98 --> 01:09:55.50 That night, well, what did you learn?
01:09:55.50 --> 01:10:01.26 And it always be just back and forth to try to get any sense of what happened to anything
01:10:01.26 --> 01:10:05.38 you could do to give us anything for another edge in the field.
01:10:05.38 --> 01:10:07.02 And meanwhile, we're getting the intel reports.
01:10:07.02 --> 01:10:09.82 We knew about all the teams that had been wiped out.
01:10:09.82 --> 01:10:12.50 And the intel reports about the sappers.
01:10:12.50 --> 01:10:15.34 So you all bounced it out and just keep things with us.
01:10:15.34 --> 01:10:17.50 So an answer to your question.
01:10:17.50 --> 01:10:20.22 Sog was so different, a lot of with innovative.
01:10:20.22 --> 01:10:23.14 The things we were doing there were the strings.
01:10:23.14 --> 01:10:26.34 That was all things that used today really advanced.
01:10:26.34 --> 01:10:28.34 You know, no fast ropes.
01:10:28.34 --> 01:10:31.94 That was another dimension of when, another war.
01:10:31.94 --> 01:10:39.54 So we're working that firepower, working with the air assets and new weapons.
01:10:39.54 --> 01:10:41.18 But it was all like to experiment with things.
01:10:41.18 --> 01:10:42.98 The learns you go, try to take was best.
01:10:42.98 --> 01:10:46.86 And like, limb black blow yourself up in the, and the ambushes were good luck to make
01:10:46.86 --> 01:10:49.66 sure it really works.
01:10:49.66 --> 01:10:51.86 Did you, when you were calling for fires?
01:10:51.86 --> 01:10:55.62 So I don't know if you know this, but now it's like a school you go to.
01:10:55.62 --> 01:10:59.98 You go to a joint tattoo leader controller school and that's sort of your specialty is calling
01:10:59.98 --> 01:11:02.26 for fire call or bombs.
01:11:02.26 --> 01:11:08.02 But you just, you trained in country to learn how to do it.
01:11:08.02 --> 01:11:09.02 Yes.
01:11:09.02 --> 01:11:14.86 And again, we talked to, that's what we talked to spider and pat walk as specifically.
01:11:14.86 --> 01:11:19.22 And so that was, that was more important than actually going out pop in the smoke and
01:11:19.22 --> 01:11:20.70 having the gun run.
01:11:20.70 --> 01:11:23.42 It was learning how to do it the right way.
01:11:23.42 --> 01:11:27.74 Now you're in a box and you never have a gun run go across you.
01:11:27.74 --> 01:11:32.58 It'd be in front, you know, you're front to left southeast and you direct it that way.
01:11:32.58 --> 01:11:37.82 And how many inches, I mean, how many feet of yards from your perimeter, how many meters.
01:11:37.82 --> 01:11:44.58 And that applied when we got to the field because once we were up at Fubai, we didn't
01:11:44.58 --> 01:11:45.58 practice air strikes.
01:11:45.58 --> 01:11:48.74 Once we were on the ground, we did it.
01:11:48.74 --> 01:11:50.70 But it did it with confidence.
01:11:50.70 --> 01:11:54.70 Thanks to spider or walkins and John McGovern particularly.
01:11:54.70 --> 01:11:59.14 They sat with us, our green guys at night and made us understand that.
01:11:59.14 --> 01:12:04.70 And we had a couple cases where people made mistakes and teams got hit and lost people.
01:12:04.70 --> 01:12:07.18 They had their brain and some people.
01:12:07.18 --> 01:12:11.38 We were our body count was so low that they were bringing in people from other units.
01:12:11.38 --> 01:12:14.02 And they would come in cocky.
01:12:14.02 --> 01:12:17.46 And once they got on the ground, they were just maybe a little too cocky and had to listen
01:12:17.46 --> 01:12:19.50 to all lessons.
01:12:19.50 --> 01:12:22.18 And some of the teams will let the other people carry their rest.
01:12:22.18 --> 01:12:23.90 Why carry their radio.
01:12:23.90 --> 01:12:29.82 And we had one team, young guy came in and called the air strike on its own team.
01:12:29.82 --> 01:12:32.66 They came with a gun and we're right across the teams.
01:12:32.66 --> 01:12:35.82 R.O.N. and it's like that.
01:12:35.82 --> 01:12:38.38 So that does not surprise me at all.
01:12:38.38 --> 01:12:45.78 I mean, when I'm listening to a reading your books, the fact that you guys were doing that,
01:12:45.78 --> 01:12:50.06 you obviously had a massive amount of skill to not have that happen.
01:12:50.06 --> 01:12:53.62 Because like I said, these guys are looking at a jungle canopy.
01:12:53.62 --> 01:12:58.50 They look at some random bit of smoke that came out and yet you're directing fire based
01:12:58.50 --> 01:12:59.50 on that.
01:12:59.50 --> 01:13:00.78 It's awesome.
01:13:00.78 --> 01:13:05.06 But I could see where somebody could easily make a mistake.
01:13:05.06 --> 01:13:07.86 You give the wrong direction.
01:13:07.86 --> 01:13:09.70 Look at your compass is spinning the wrong way.
01:13:09.70 --> 01:13:10.70 It's good close to your weapon.
01:13:10.70 --> 01:13:12.06 You've got your carmel directions.
01:13:12.06 --> 01:13:14.38 I mean, there's so many things that could go wrong.
01:13:14.38 --> 01:13:16.74 And yet you're just doing.
01:13:16.74 --> 01:13:21.94 I mean, there's times we're out there doing gun runs for 12 hours straight.
01:13:21.94 --> 01:13:29.50 And like your case, where you had the unit that you wanted to attack the building and
01:13:29.50 --> 01:13:33.38 you challenged the three times and the last time you called it up because it was another
01:13:33.38 --> 01:13:35.22 unit, another seal team.
01:13:35.22 --> 01:13:39.62 Well, we had that common sense thing on the ground, too, where we would direct it.
01:13:39.62 --> 01:13:43.70 But if there was something that wasn't quite right, you put everything on hold until
01:13:43.70 --> 01:13:45.30 you got it right.
01:13:45.30 --> 01:13:46.54 Yeah, that's weird.
01:13:46.54 --> 01:13:53.62 Because late for my road extreme ownership and we didn't really coordinate stories that
01:13:53.62 --> 01:13:54.78 we were talking about.
01:13:54.78 --> 01:13:59.30 And yet there's multiple stories in there about either blue on blues or a potential blue
01:13:59.30 --> 01:14:04.22 on blues because man in a city like that with all these different units running around
01:14:04.22 --> 01:14:09.90 all on different radio frequencies and a bunch of enemy, Mujah, Dean fighters running
01:14:09.90 --> 01:14:10.86 around in there, too.
01:14:10.86 --> 01:14:13.78 It was blue on blue was a very real thing.
01:14:13.78 --> 01:14:20.06 And there would be probably one case of blue on blue a day that would happen and maybe
01:14:20.06 --> 01:14:22.34 one a week that would get reported.
01:14:22.34 --> 01:14:27.18 You know, but just, and I'm not talking where someone is shot, but like, you know, just
01:14:27.18 --> 01:14:29.98 all of a sudden you're taking rounds and you're like, where are those coming from?
01:14:29.98 --> 01:14:32.22 Oh, that's another unit down there.
01:14:32.22 --> 01:14:36.46 And maybe before, and for a one opening up moment, exactly exactly.
01:14:36.46 --> 01:14:39.50 So that it would happen all the time.
01:14:39.50 --> 01:14:43.58 And that's one thing that was nice about, well, for you, if not nice, but it's
01:14:43.58 --> 01:14:46.94 less complicated, you're the only friendly guys out there to watch out.
01:14:46.94 --> 01:14:48.42 Oh, there was no friendly fire happening.
01:14:48.42 --> 01:14:50.42 You guys, you're a versus them.
01:14:50.42 --> 01:14:51.42 Yeah, all of them.
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:51.42 Yeah.
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:59.26 When you got mission taskings, where did they come from?
01:14:59.26 --> 01:15:00.98 Where did they come from up above?
01:15:00.98 --> 01:15:03.02 Where you guys developing targets yourself?
01:15:03.02 --> 01:15:04.02 Where did that process?
01:15:04.02 --> 01:15:07.42 That's what happened, mix of both.
01:15:07.42 --> 01:15:11.26 The Channing Command for Saw, went to Sawcheadquarters right to the White House.
01:15:11.26 --> 01:15:14.46 They had somebody from DOD that was there.
01:15:14.46 --> 01:15:16.54 I don't know, some general, somebody.
01:15:16.54 --> 01:15:19.66 But that was their mission was keeping on on Sawc.
01:15:19.66 --> 01:15:25.66 So they was sent missions from there that would come to Headquarters to each F.O.B.
01:15:25.66 --> 01:15:31.34 And then our immediate action reports that I'll go back after action reports to go back
01:15:31.34 --> 01:15:33.14 through the Channing Command.
01:15:33.14 --> 01:15:35.66 So they knew what was going on at the White House.
01:15:35.66 --> 01:15:36.82 There was somebody at the White House.
01:15:36.82 --> 01:15:38.22 That's where we were told.
01:15:38.22 --> 01:15:44.38 And on occasions, if we had a target that we wanted to do B.52 strike, that would go back
01:15:44.38 --> 01:15:47.86 through the Channing Command and then get approval on it.
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:53.46 But from what the public knew, the public knew we were bombing.
01:15:53.46 --> 01:15:54.46 Not even know anything about that.
01:15:54.46 --> 01:15:59.14 They didn't even know we were bombing Louson Combo to get.
01:15:59.14 --> 01:16:00.14 Nothing.
01:16:00.14 --> 01:16:01.42 There was no reporters in there.
01:16:01.42 --> 01:16:05.22 There's no communist news network back then.
01:16:05.22 --> 01:16:12.70 So the communist would not talk about it because they agreed to the agreement.
01:16:12.70 --> 01:16:13.86 Not having their people there.
01:16:13.86 --> 01:16:16.26 Cadillac said, hey, Louson Combo, they're neutral.
01:16:16.26 --> 01:16:17.46 We respect them.
01:16:17.46 --> 01:16:19.46 Line dogs.
01:16:19.46 --> 01:16:20.74 And we said the same thing.
01:16:20.74 --> 01:16:23.26 But ours, we just went in with our recon teams.
01:16:23.26 --> 01:16:28.14 I suppose that them just going down and slaving all the people to work there.
01:16:28.14 --> 01:16:30.74 Work with us, help us open the roads.
01:16:30.74 --> 01:16:33.74 And if we saw in Disney's people, we would not open fire on.
01:16:33.74 --> 01:16:35.86 I mean, it's like not going to go at local people.
01:16:35.86 --> 01:16:39.66 They don't know any better, just caught in the middle.
01:16:39.66 --> 01:16:43.66 But the NVA, they were talking.
01:16:43.66 --> 01:16:45.26 You work with us so you die.
01:16:45.26 --> 01:16:50.74 Well, you know, in one of the books you're talking about how the NVA treated the
01:16:50.74 --> 01:16:55.70 in-dedge people there, so horribly that the in-dedge troops that you worked with, but
01:16:55.70 --> 01:16:56.70 hated the NVA.
01:16:56.70 --> 01:16:57.70 Oh, they hated them.
01:16:57.70 --> 01:17:02.66 That these NVA had raped their women, beat their wives and just unharable things.
01:17:02.66 --> 01:17:03.66 Absolutely.
01:17:03.66 --> 01:17:06.58 They were there for, they were there to fight.
01:17:06.58 --> 01:17:07.58 Yep.
01:17:07.58 --> 01:17:10.98 And they cut nobody else like them.
01:17:10.98 --> 01:17:17.02 I mean, America today, particularly our snowflakes, don't know what the soldiers of
01:17:17.02 --> 01:17:20.10 Communists were really like in the field.
01:17:20.10 --> 01:17:22.54 And it's just nasty people.
01:17:22.54 --> 01:17:25.26 And that's what we were fighting.
01:17:25.26 --> 01:17:27.30 And they were really dedicated.
01:17:27.30 --> 01:17:32.62 And they're just, that's a purpose because they've been so thoroughly indoctrinated.
01:17:32.62 --> 01:17:40.06 And they really believe what they were doing, even though they were working off a propaganda.
01:17:40.06 --> 01:17:41.26 Yeah.
01:17:41.26 --> 01:17:44.98 When you, so you would come up with some of the missions, some of the missions would come
01:17:44.98 --> 01:17:45.98 down to you.
01:17:45.98 --> 01:17:46.98 Majority came.
01:17:46.98 --> 01:17:47.98 Majority came down to you.
01:17:47.98 --> 01:17:52.90 And of course, you know, they would have, sometimes I think there would be, we
01:17:52.90 --> 01:17:53.90 got a team on a ground.
01:17:53.90 --> 01:17:58.62 That's why we were going in primary secondary all think it's shot out, eat lunch, go
01:17:58.62 --> 01:17:59.62 back and try again.
01:17:59.62 --> 01:18:02.38 And they just wanted to get somebody on the ground.
01:18:02.38 --> 01:18:06.06 And that would just be your, that's an automatic area of reconnaissance.
01:18:06.06 --> 01:18:09.46 And that's because they had something they wanted to see there, something like that.
01:18:09.46 --> 01:18:12.98 Sometimes her S3 people would just want to get a team on the ground so they could
01:18:12.98 --> 01:18:14.34 report a headquarters at night.
01:18:14.34 --> 01:18:17.74 We had one or two teams on the ground.
01:18:17.74 --> 01:18:21.06 Wait, do you mean that they're just wanting to, hey, look what we're doing?
01:18:21.06 --> 01:18:22.06 Yeah.
01:18:22.06 --> 01:18:26.70 Now, I'll show you guys that on S3 would deny that in fanitly.
01:18:26.70 --> 01:18:28.10 But it felt like that.
01:18:28.10 --> 01:18:29.10 Yeah.
01:18:29.10 --> 01:18:31.50 I came back and said, here's the new target.
01:18:31.50 --> 01:18:36.86 And they'll pick an LZ for you while you're flying back to the next target.
01:18:36.86 --> 01:18:40.46 Did you ever, what if you, what if there was a mission that you looked at and you said, hey,
01:18:40.46 --> 01:18:42.02 this is dumb.
01:18:42.02 --> 01:18:43.62 This doesn't make sense.
01:18:43.62 --> 01:18:47.10 What is only one that I declined to remember about Christmas time of 68.
01:18:47.10 --> 01:18:48.70 I just had a feeling.
01:18:48.70 --> 01:18:49.70 And a team went in.
01:18:49.70 --> 01:18:50.70 I was worried.
01:18:50.70 --> 01:18:53.14 But they were on the ground for five days and it was a dry hole.
01:18:53.14 --> 01:18:56.46 And they came out without any shots fired or anything.
01:18:56.46 --> 01:18:59.22 So that's the one time I officially turned something down.
01:18:59.22 --> 01:19:00.70 Maybe that's why you had a bad feeling.
01:19:00.70 --> 01:19:02.86 Tell it, you knew nothing was going to happen.
01:19:02.86 --> 01:19:04.38 It wasn't your kind of target.
01:19:04.38 --> 01:19:05.38 Yeah.
01:19:05.38 --> 01:19:08.58 I don't want a boring target.
01:19:08.58 --> 01:19:11.30 So how did it go when you said no?
01:19:11.30 --> 01:19:12.90 Would you say, hey, look, my guys need rest.
01:19:12.90 --> 01:19:13.90 Sorry.
01:19:13.90 --> 01:19:14.90 Yeah, not this time.
01:19:14.90 --> 01:19:16.42 We had to write to say no.
01:19:16.42 --> 01:19:17.58 It was frowned on.
01:19:17.58 --> 01:19:22.34 But at that time, we had a couple of new teams in camp.
01:19:22.34 --> 01:19:25.46 And Rodney had came in and he was a good one zero.
01:19:25.46 --> 01:19:28.14 So he went out and he came back to, hey, that target was pretty cool.
01:19:28.14 --> 01:19:30.14 We stopped a lot.
01:19:30.14 --> 01:19:31.14 Dry hole.
01:19:31.14 --> 01:19:32.14 Dry hole.
01:19:32.14 --> 01:19:33.14 I said, really?
01:19:33.14 --> 01:19:34.14 So how are these feelings, man?
01:19:34.14 --> 01:19:35.62 I was hyperventilating to that figure.
01:19:35.62 --> 01:19:40.30 We were going to run into Ho Chi Minh and a couple of divisions again for good luck.
01:19:40.30 --> 01:19:42.86 I hadn't seen a division in a month.
01:19:42.86 --> 01:19:45.38 No, it's like, okay.
01:19:45.38 --> 01:19:46.38 But no.
01:19:46.38 --> 01:19:50.58 So that kind of showed me how your mental state of mind too.
01:19:50.58 --> 01:19:53.58 Because that's why I believed.
01:19:53.58 --> 01:19:56.94 And the system was such that you could turn it down.
01:19:56.94 --> 01:19:58.06 And we took it from there.
01:19:58.06 --> 01:20:02.22 When you say that's where you believed, you believed that it was a bad target.
01:20:02.22 --> 01:20:07.38 I just thought we had been so lucky and going through the Christmas Thanksgiving and everything
01:20:07.38 --> 01:20:12.10 else that our, I just thought our number was going to be, we didn't know how.
01:20:12.10 --> 01:20:14.10 And I just said, this could be the target.
01:20:14.10 --> 01:20:14.74 It's an M.A.
01:20:14.74 --> 01:20:15.74 Target.
01:20:15.74 --> 01:20:22.78 And those are particularly, the ones are on long to DMZ River west of Vietnam that went deeper
01:20:22.78 --> 01:20:24.30 into chaos.
01:20:24.30 --> 01:20:27.02 And there were nasty, we lost several teams up there.
01:20:27.02 --> 01:20:29.10 I figured this could be our turn.
01:20:29.10 --> 01:20:31.10 So, buzz wrong?
01:20:31.10 --> 01:20:35.94 No, did you ever get that feeling again?
01:20:35.94 --> 01:20:38.06 Not, not not strong enough to act on it.
01:20:38.06 --> 01:20:40.78 I mean, the carried it back in my tiny mind.
01:20:40.78 --> 01:20:44.66 It was like, that's the best time you thought you were going to die.
01:20:44.66 --> 01:20:45.66 You didn't.
01:20:45.66 --> 01:20:49.02 I had some guys that thought they were going to die every time we left the wire.
01:20:49.02 --> 01:20:54.02 You know what I mean?
01:20:54.02 --> 01:20:56.02 God bless them, but he's no man, this could die could be the night man.
01:20:56.02 --> 01:20:57.02 No, I'm not feeling good about this one.
01:20:57.02 --> 01:20:59.86 And they'd always get their gear on, but I'd say, I mean, I always looked at as a good sign.
01:20:59.86 --> 01:21:04.02 If certain people were scared, if they wouldn't have been scared, I would have been nervous
01:21:04.02 --> 01:21:05.82 because they were so scared all the time.
01:21:05.82 --> 01:21:10.02 I think, man, this must be really stressful for them.
01:21:10.02 --> 01:21:11.02 I never wrote the letter.
01:21:11.02 --> 01:21:13.02 We're like, dear mom and dad, I'm dead now.
01:21:13.02 --> 01:21:15.02 If you read this letter, I'm dead.
01:21:15.02 --> 01:21:16.02 Yeah.
01:21:16.02 --> 01:21:21.02 I felt, and hope that we somehow get through it.
01:21:21.02 --> 01:21:23.02 And you're right about the scare thing.
01:21:23.02 --> 01:21:26.02 You want that emotional edge, a little fear can go along.
01:21:26.02 --> 01:21:28.02 It's a great motivator.
01:21:28.02 --> 01:21:34.02 But I wouldn't go out with a guy if somebody was saying, hey, man, I'm not afraid.
01:21:34.02 --> 01:21:36.02 I'm afraid of you, do you go somebody else?
01:21:36.02 --> 01:21:44.02 I also used to get the feeling that if you were scared like that, if you were scared,
01:21:44.02 --> 01:21:48.02 and you were going to be hesitant, that was going to be bad.
01:21:48.02 --> 01:21:49.02 Sure.
01:21:49.02 --> 01:21:57.02 Like, I was more worried about guys that were hesitant or I felt like if they were hesitant
01:21:57.02 --> 01:22:03.02 on the battlefield, that would work out bad for them.
01:22:03.02 --> 01:22:08.02 The guys that I always felt like, okay, if someone's aggressive, not not unaffraid
01:22:08.02 --> 01:22:13.02 and suicidal like that, but just, hey, oh yeah, I'm going to go, I'm going to go,
01:22:13.02 --> 01:22:14.02 I'm going to go out with a guy right now.
01:22:14.02 --> 01:22:16.02 I always felt that was the attitude to have.
01:22:16.02 --> 01:22:17.02 It was to be aggressive.
01:22:17.02 --> 01:22:21.02 It was to be like, okay, yeah, well, oh, you want an opt for us?
01:22:21.02 --> 01:22:22.02 Cool, we'll go do it.
01:22:22.02 --> 01:22:24.02 Now we turned down opts too.
01:22:24.02 --> 01:22:28.02 There was opts where we looked at and said, man, this is not good.
01:22:28.02 --> 01:22:30.02 And this is a massive amount of risk.
01:22:30.02 --> 01:22:36.02 I mean, there was areas where there was areas where they were taken,
01:22:36.02 --> 01:22:40.02 IED strikes on vehicles, and like, you know,
01:22:40.02 --> 01:22:45.02 when in a big IED hits a Humvee, everyone dies or three out of five people die or something like that,
01:22:45.02 --> 01:22:47.02 I mean, it's very catastrophic.
01:22:47.02 --> 01:22:50.02 And it was one target they were looking at for us.
01:22:50.02 --> 01:22:52.02 They asked us to do.
01:22:52.02 --> 01:22:57.02 And there was like one road going in and that had multiple big IED strikes.
01:22:57.02 --> 01:23:03.02 And then they wanted us to, they were asking if we could take out more,
01:23:03.02 --> 01:23:07.02 it was either a mortar team or an IED in place or but we were looking at it and where
01:23:07.02 --> 01:23:09.02 the mortar has been launched from, we're all over the place.
01:23:09.02 --> 01:23:14.02 So it was just, it was one of the, one of the types of missions where we looked at it and said,
01:23:14.02 --> 01:23:18.02 hey, there's got to be a better way to do this because us going up there is not going to be worse than it.
01:23:18.02 --> 01:23:20.02 A lot of your missions were point missions, right?
01:23:20.02 --> 01:23:21.02 What do you mean by that?
01:23:21.02 --> 01:23:25.02 They gave you a target, get to this point and wipe it out.
01:23:25.02 --> 01:23:31.02 I would say my first deployment, it was go capture kill back guys.
01:23:31.02 --> 01:23:33.02 That was my first deployment to Iraq, we were in Baghdad,
01:23:33.02 --> 01:23:34.02 that's mostly what we were doing.
01:23:34.02 --> 01:23:38.02 Middle the night, we'd find out where a bad guy was, we'd go get him.
01:23:38.02 --> 01:23:44.02 And that's what my second deployment in Ramadi, mostly what guys were doing was
01:23:44.02 --> 01:23:47.02 Overwatch, sniper Overwatch positions set up and building.
01:23:47.02 --> 01:23:52.02 So that when the bad guys would either maneuver on friendly forces or they'd be out doing what they
01:23:52.02 --> 01:23:53.02 shouldn't be doing, right?
01:23:53.02 --> 01:23:54.02 The guys would take them out.
01:23:54.02 --> 01:24:00.02 So that's pretty much the, then there's all kinds of crap in between that everything from,
01:24:00.02 --> 01:24:03.02 you know, everything from doing just reconnaissance of areas.
01:24:03.02 --> 01:24:10.02 To counter mortar types, it's just, you know, a lot of other things would happen.
01:24:10.02 --> 01:24:15.02 But primarily it was direct action missions going out, take out a target or these sniper
01:24:15.02 --> 01:24:20.02 Overwatch types, but you know, we'd be doing big clearances to big conventional clearances.
01:24:20.02 --> 01:24:23.02 You know, we had our, we called them jundies, which is,
01:24:23.02 --> 01:24:26.02 the jundie means, it means soldier in, in Arabic.
01:24:26.02 --> 01:24:27.02 Right.
01:24:27.02 --> 01:24:30.02 And so we call them jundies, that's what they call themselves jundies.
01:24:30.02 --> 01:24:34.02 So we had jundies, like you guys had little people, like you had in-ditch force.
01:24:34.02 --> 01:24:36.02 We had in-ditch forces, they were jundies.
01:24:36.02 --> 01:24:41.02 And so we would do very conventional missions with the jundies of them.
01:24:41.02 --> 01:24:44.02 And us, you know, we'd be overseeing them as they cleared big sections of the city.
01:24:44.02 --> 01:24:47.02 And we'd be working in conjunction with the army.
01:24:47.02 --> 01:24:50.02 So yeah, we did a little bit of everything.
01:24:50.02 --> 01:24:54.02 But, um, we see that brings us back to our side of it,
01:24:54.02 --> 01:24:57.02 where you can give yourself a mental delusion,
01:24:57.02 --> 01:25:02.02 which is our mission is to go look in an area recon.
01:25:02.02 --> 01:25:06.02 So theoretically, you're going to get inserted quietly and go back to your job.
01:25:06.02 --> 01:25:09.02 And that's different from you with your point of mission.
01:25:09.02 --> 01:25:11.02 So hold different frame of mind.
01:25:11.02 --> 01:25:15.02 So, theoretically, okay, we're hoping to get in to our mission to come back and report,
01:25:15.02 --> 01:25:20.02 or find a fuel line, blow it up, or get the POW,
01:25:20.02 --> 01:25:26.02 get the wire taps, give them a mental, where you're going out and doing your IED pick-up,
01:25:26.02 --> 01:25:29.02 and mortars, that's totally different.
01:25:29.02 --> 01:25:34.02 So at least in my mind, I think that's part of my self-confered factor.
01:25:34.02 --> 01:25:38.02 We're going to get inserted and cover nice quiet mission for five or six days.
01:25:38.02 --> 01:25:40.02 Takes some pictures.
01:25:40.02 --> 01:25:41.02 That sounds great.
01:25:41.02 --> 01:25:43.02 And come on back, it's really cool.
01:25:43.02 --> 01:25:43.02 Yeah.
01:25:43.02 --> 01:25:44.02 We're behind any mean line.
01:25:44.02 --> 01:25:48.02 What percentage of operations would you guys get contacted on?
01:25:48.02 --> 01:25:50.02 We left, always left under fire.
01:25:50.02 --> 01:25:52.02 The only question was how much?
01:25:52.02 --> 01:25:55.02 Never had, well, one.
01:25:55.02 --> 01:26:01.02 They won, where we got, you opened up our discussion tonight, where we got pulled out.
01:26:01.02 --> 01:26:03.02 There's no fire there because they came in and got us.
01:26:03.02 --> 01:26:09.02 We had a great RON, and we were going to get some POWs, but they pulled us out right away.
01:26:09.02 --> 01:26:13.02 So it's no gunfire in that mission, but other than that, every time we left under gunfire,
01:26:13.02 --> 01:26:15.02 it's only a question of how much.
01:26:15.02 --> 01:26:18.02 Some titles like the whole John Lowe light enough.
01:26:18.02 --> 01:26:20.02 Sometimes it'll only be two or three hundred.
01:26:20.02 --> 01:26:22.02 And yet you still fooled yourself with the thinking,
01:26:22.02 --> 01:26:26.02 hey, this recon is going to be different.
01:26:26.02 --> 01:26:32.02 But yeah, so I guess my point was I looked at it, and I still look at it.
01:26:32.02 --> 01:26:37.02 If you are nervous about getting hurt, if you're nervous about something going wrong,
01:26:37.02 --> 01:26:39.02 to me, that's when something goes wrong.
01:26:39.02 --> 01:26:40.02 Yeah.
01:26:40.02 --> 01:26:43.02 When you're nervous about it, now I'm not saying you should be arrogant about it and think,
01:26:43.02 --> 01:26:45.02 oh, we're going to get away with whatever.
01:26:45.02 --> 01:26:50.02 But I'm saying, like when you're doing a sport, you know,
01:26:50.02 --> 01:26:54.02 when you're doing some physical activity, if you're afraid, you might get injured.
01:26:54.02 --> 01:26:56.02 To me, that's when you get injured.
01:26:56.02 --> 01:27:01.02 It's when you're, when you're afraid, I think fear can hurt you.
01:27:01.02 --> 01:27:05.02 And that being said, the other side of the coin is, if you have no fear,
01:27:05.02 --> 01:27:07.02 well, you're definitely at risk.
01:27:07.02 --> 01:27:09.02 He who has a taste is lost.
01:27:09.02 --> 01:27:10.02 There you go.
01:27:10.02 --> 01:27:11.02 So there's a dichotomy there.
01:27:11.02 --> 01:27:12.02 That's not a good balance.
01:27:12.02 --> 01:27:14.02 Yeah, and that's where we're so lucky.
01:27:14.02 --> 01:27:18.02 You know, heept a sale that a great job of vetting our indigenous troops,
01:27:18.02 --> 01:27:22.02 and to go from spider parks to walk in to Baba,
01:27:22.02 --> 01:27:26.02 and then back to Limbac, and then when I left the team,
01:27:26.02 --> 01:27:28.02 it was in Lens Hands.
01:27:28.02 --> 01:27:31.02 And then I came back, Lens the ones, you know,
01:27:31.02 --> 01:27:33.02 what more could you ask for?
01:27:33.02 --> 01:27:36.02 So that was just a very fortunate.
01:27:36.02 --> 01:27:39.02 What was your mission planning like?
01:27:39.02 --> 01:27:41.02 So you guys get a tasking?
01:27:41.02 --> 01:27:44.02 How long did you guys plan for?
01:27:44.02 --> 01:27:48.02 For just an area mission, area reconcest, very little.
01:27:48.02 --> 01:27:52.02 With the wire tabs, obviously we did hours and hours of training on that.
01:27:52.02 --> 01:27:56.02 And then as time went on, you know, first it was just sale,
01:27:56.02 --> 01:27:58.02 who could do it, and then sale trained,
01:27:58.02 --> 01:28:02.02 have and fuck the guys are as strong to do it all.
01:28:02.02 --> 01:28:05.02 And as well, every aspect of it,
01:28:05.02 --> 01:28:07.02 and then we cross trained each other.
01:28:07.02 --> 01:28:09.02 And we even had so that,
01:28:09.02 --> 01:28:14.02 we had to begin to teach a couple of young guys basic English.
01:28:14.02 --> 01:28:16.02 So if any of us got killed,
01:28:16.02 --> 01:28:20.02 had to take over to radio, or the end did to take over.
01:28:20.02 --> 01:28:22.02 So a couple of guys that like,
01:28:22.02 --> 01:28:24.02 chow and hung, as it went,
01:28:24.02 --> 01:28:25.02 hung came on the team.
01:28:25.02 --> 01:28:27.02 They picked up being was pretty quick.
01:28:27.02 --> 01:28:28.02 So we worked with them.
01:28:28.02 --> 01:28:31.02 And we practiced calling in, working on the radio,
01:28:31.02 --> 01:28:33.02 the problems with the batteries, and things like that.
01:28:33.02 --> 01:28:36.02 So we crossed trained everything back and forth.
01:28:36.02 --> 01:28:40.02 And the wire tab was one of the particular ones where we had several guys in the team
01:28:40.02 --> 01:28:41.02 trained up to do it all.
01:28:41.02 --> 01:28:44.02 Everything from known about the batteries, watching it,
01:28:44.02 --> 01:28:49.02 keeping the battery indicator to get to put the wire up the tree
01:28:49.02 --> 01:28:51.02 or a telephone pole.
01:28:51.02 --> 01:28:52.02 And when you came down to your cover,
01:28:52.02 --> 01:28:55.02 that was from that area.
01:28:55.02 --> 01:28:58.02 So it looked like it was part of that area, trying to cover the wire.
01:28:58.02 --> 01:29:01.02 But as far as the actual mission planning of,
01:29:01.02 --> 01:29:04.02 okay, here's where we're going in tonight.
01:29:04.02 --> 01:29:09.02 They didn't take you much because you were running repetitive type missions.
01:29:09.02 --> 01:29:11.02 It's a high degree of similarity.
01:29:11.02 --> 01:29:13.02 The most important thing was the training.
01:29:13.02 --> 01:29:17.02 So when you may contact, you could take care of yourself and
01:29:17.02 --> 01:29:20.02 how to react, try to continue the mission.
01:29:20.02 --> 01:29:22.02 But these were like reconnaissance.
01:29:22.02 --> 01:29:27.02 So once you've been seen or compromised, the mission's compromised.
01:29:27.02 --> 01:29:31.02 Would you be flying in?
01:29:31.02 --> 01:29:35.02 What was your degree of certainty on where you were inserted?
01:29:35.02 --> 01:29:38.02 Oh, we knew very clear where we were gone.
01:29:38.02 --> 01:29:41.02 So like in the case, we talked to Kavi.
01:29:41.02 --> 01:29:44.02 We sent the three LZs down to Saigon.
01:29:44.02 --> 01:29:46.02 And Kavi would go pick a site.
01:29:46.02 --> 01:29:50.02 And then he would tell me on the radio, okay, this is where we're gone.
01:29:50.02 --> 01:29:53.02 And would you be looking at your map as you started?
01:29:53.02 --> 01:29:55.02 And he knew what the frame was.
01:29:55.02 --> 01:29:57.02 So it would be in that map.
01:29:57.02 --> 01:29:58.02 Yeah.
01:29:58.02 --> 01:30:01.02 That we would have sexed them out that we could.
01:30:01.02 --> 01:30:05.02 I remember when we first, you know, as a radioman, believe it or not,
01:30:05.02 --> 01:30:10.02 when GPS's first came out, the radioman kind of got saddled with the GPS
01:30:10.02 --> 01:30:12.02 because it was a piece of electronic equipment.
01:30:12.02 --> 01:30:15.02 No one else could work with electronic equipment.
01:30:15.02 --> 01:30:19.02 So I would be usually a lot of times be carrying the GPS as opposed to the
01:30:19.02 --> 01:30:20.02 point meant.
01:30:20.02 --> 01:30:23.02 And the point man, you know, was still using mapping compasses that early
01:30:23.02 --> 01:30:28.02 in the early 90s. But the GPS wouldn't always work well in a helicopter.
01:30:28.02 --> 01:30:34.02 And so sometimes they took me, you know, this is some training operations where I learned
01:30:34.02 --> 01:30:36.02 oh, so I'm not what I think I am.
01:30:36.02 --> 01:30:40.02 And you get out and that GPS finally finds itself and you realize your three
01:30:40.02 --> 01:30:43.02 clicks away from where you're supposed to be or whatever and it's bad.
01:30:43.02 --> 01:30:47.02 And that's why we'd go, I went back to, hey, when I'm in the helicopter, I'm on a map.
01:30:47.02 --> 01:30:50.02 So that way when my boss looks at me and says, hey, we're we're we're we're
01:30:50.02 --> 01:30:55.02 supposed to be either yes or no, like don't get out of the bird or okay, we're good.
01:30:55.02 --> 01:31:00.02 But but that. So I was thinking about that for you guys. You'd be doing the same thing
01:31:00.02 --> 01:31:03.02 as you approach to okay, yep, there's that train feature. There's this other train
01:31:03.02 --> 01:31:06.02 feature, cool where we're we're we're supposed to be.
01:31:06.02 --> 01:31:10.02 Yeah, and then last also we wanted to know what a water was because some of the
01:31:10.02 --> 01:31:14.02 targets they had more more streams of things. So we carry less water. I will
01:31:14.02 --> 01:31:18.02 literally just carry one canteen with the purification pills so that we're in for
01:31:18.02 --> 01:31:23.02 several days like with Echo 4. But at the first day, we had gone through some water
01:31:23.02 --> 01:31:28.02 and took we all took a turn going into the little stream put the purification
01:31:28.02 --> 01:31:32.02 pills in hit the water and let it sit for a couple of hours before you
01:31:32.02 --> 01:31:36.02 drank it. Did you get acclimated where you needed less water? Oh, yeah, absolutely.
01:31:36.02 --> 01:31:42.02 Less water and I can truly say I never defecate and lay us.
01:31:42.02 --> 01:31:49.02 Somehow the body just tightened up and they had no ship pills that guys would
01:31:49.02 --> 01:31:55.02 take so they literally would not go to the bathroom. I worried about those.
01:31:55.02 --> 01:32:00.02 Yeah, that wouldn't help me there. Oh, yeah. I was like, anyway, for numerous reasons
01:32:00.02 --> 01:32:05.02 that the creative mind can think about. But so I didn't but my body never had
01:32:05.02 --> 01:32:09.02 and then we never did it. And the you guys didn't.
01:32:09.02 --> 01:32:16.02 Did you guys have you guys did you guys use imagery at all? Like overhead imagery?
01:32:16.02 --> 01:32:24.02 Nothing. No, some of the, uh, uh, the cobras. No, no, some of the first
01:32:24.02 --> 01:32:34.02 calf pillow copters had some, uh, a trying to think what I are. They would have, uh,
01:32:34.02 --> 01:32:40.02 the ability to see through the clouds and stuff. Okay. And it was just a very
01:32:40.02 --> 01:32:44.02 primitive boat beginning, uh, whereas the cobras gunsters didn't have it.
01:32:44.02 --> 01:32:49.02 But the first calf could get low into the jungle and navigate and fog and
01:32:49.02 --> 01:32:54.02 stuff to get down to our guys. But no, you guys wouldn't see photographs of
01:32:54.02 --> 01:32:58.02 the areas where you were going into it all. No, the only time was down in
01:32:58.02 --> 01:33:04.02 the camp, but for that misnare where that was, um, that base was really close to
01:33:04.02 --> 01:33:09.02 Saigon close to Mac Veehead quarters. And, um, we may have had overviews.
01:33:09.02 --> 01:33:14.02 I just forget for up north that one down there. I stuck stuck on my mind.
01:33:14.02 --> 01:33:18.02 And then what was your, what was your optempo like? In other words,
01:33:18.02 --> 01:33:23.02 how often were you going in the field? Well, through an November, December,
01:33:23.02 --> 01:33:28.02 we, if we weren't on the, if we weren't on the ground, we were getting ready to go back
01:33:28.02 --> 01:33:33.02 to next day. That's why it was such a push, push, push, and I rotate our
01:33:33.02 --> 01:33:37.02 little people out because they were just getting beat. And we had trained them up
01:33:37.02 --> 01:33:41.02 so by November, December, all the cross training we had done in those months.
01:33:41.02 --> 01:33:46.02 You know, South could take a day off, uh, even have to take a day off.
01:33:46.02 --> 01:33:50.02 We had a couple of guys that could speak enough English. If anything happened to me
01:33:50.02 --> 01:33:55.02 or Baba, they could take care of the radio due to comms. And, um, so we
01:33:55.02 --> 01:34:00.02 rotate them through. But it was every day. And then, if the weather came,
01:34:00.02 --> 01:34:06.02 we get a break. And, um, so there was no, and the rule that was, if you ran
01:34:06.02 --> 01:34:10.02 on Mission for Five Days, you came back, you got five days off. So you could
01:34:10.02 --> 01:34:14.02 clean up and get back and shape, get the team ready. But for that period of
01:34:14.02 --> 01:34:19.02 time, we had minimal teams. The teams at F will be one had become so
01:34:19.02 --> 01:34:26.02 between disease, um, health, guys getting wiped out, teams getting blown away.
01:34:26.02 --> 01:34:31.02 Um, we were one of the few teams in campus fully operational. So that's why
01:34:31.02 --> 01:34:35.02 that was the other pressure we had. I remember the S3 just saying, hey,
01:34:35.02 --> 01:34:39.02 you're the only guys we got, you're going to see up the noon. Here's your target.
01:34:39.02 --> 01:34:45.02 Go eat. Okay. So we did it. And then we got shot out and come back
01:34:45.02 --> 01:34:51.02 the next day. And so there was no, there's the uptampal was supposed to be
01:34:51.02 --> 01:34:55.02 rather than Mission for Five to Ten Days if you're lucky. Well, it never happened.
01:34:55.02 --> 01:34:58.02 Some guys did. So they'll give me wrong. We had some guys that were able to
01:34:58.02 --> 01:35:03.02 stay on the ground. Amazing. But in our case, we didn't. So it would be
01:35:03.02 --> 01:35:09.02 very flexible. Then you really take less than less than six guys. A few
01:35:09.02 --> 01:35:14.02 guys ran with four. And, uh, at the end of my tour duty, uh, second tour
01:35:14.02 --> 01:35:18.02 I tried to format team, but we had this whole issue with the radio stuff.
01:35:18.02 --> 01:35:22.02 Just so we could move faster. Just wanted to try anything. Something different
01:35:22.02 --> 01:35:26.02 because when we had moved fast, we had success getting away from the LZ
01:35:26.02 --> 01:35:32.02 and that caused them confusion. So if we broke what our SOPs were, it worked.
01:35:32.02 --> 01:35:36.02 But the eight man was too much, too much. I felt more comfortable with six.
01:35:36.02 --> 01:35:40.02 There was a lot of firepower. We had the M79 here. And then all the
01:35:40.02 --> 01:35:45.02 Americans at the M79 too. And then how often would you get legitimate
01:35:45.02 --> 01:35:51.02 R&R? You had one a year at one for a tour duty. You get five days
01:35:51.02 --> 01:35:55.02 anywhere you want it. So I went to Hong Kong bought my stereo
01:35:55.02 --> 01:35:59.02 by a time. It's a book of money set up. But a nice stereo,
01:35:59.02 --> 01:36:04.02 stadium art, set a home to mom and dad. My little brother put it
01:36:04.02 --> 01:36:08.02 together. He was good at that stuff. Yeah. And that's it. Other than that,
01:36:08.02 --> 01:36:12.02 there's no one R&R. If we got net PllaW.
01:36:12.02 --> 01:36:16.02 Then you would have gotten more. Yeah, we would have.
01:36:16.02 --> 01:36:18.02 What was the offer for catching a bad guy?
01:36:18.02 --> 01:36:20.02 An R&R anywhere is nowhere old. And you got a little hundred
01:36:20.02 --> 01:36:22.02 dollars bonus. How many days?
01:36:22.02 --> 01:36:24.02 Five. Like a regular R&R.
01:36:24.02 --> 01:36:28.02 Oh yeah, it was. Oh yeah. That's why we lost it for that man.
01:36:28.02 --> 01:36:31.02 I cried when it's about to say no.
01:36:31.02 --> 01:36:34.02 A hundred bucks. How much was a hundred bucks? How much was your normal paycheck?
01:36:34.02 --> 01:36:36.02 How much you make a month back then?
01:36:36.02 --> 01:36:41.02 Oh, I don't know. When we went through jump school, now I'm only a private
01:36:41.02 --> 01:36:45.02 E1 right. I got a hundred percent pay raise with my jump pay.
01:36:45.02 --> 01:36:49.02 That's getting paid $50 a month. The jump pay was 55.
01:36:49.02 --> 01:36:54.02 So 55 was a constant. Then later maybe E2 was like 75.
01:36:54.02 --> 01:36:58.02 I never paid. It was never enough. So a hundred bucks was like a hundred bucks
01:36:58.02 --> 01:37:01.02 was like a month to pay basically. Yeah, that was a lot of money.
01:37:01.02 --> 01:37:04.02 Even then a scene that was a big deal.
01:37:04.02 --> 01:37:10.02 Absolutely. And then when you guys would come back, you're talking about this.
01:37:10.02 --> 01:37:13.02 How you would sit there in debrief. Would you debrief your team?
01:37:13.02 --> 01:37:16.02 Would you guys sit down in debrief? What happened? What went wrong? What went right?
01:37:16.02 --> 01:37:18.02 We always talk to a little people.
01:37:18.02 --> 01:37:22.02 Maybe not right away because S2 would want to know what happened.
01:37:22.02 --> 01:37:25.02 So we would go in for immediate debrief.
01:37:25.02 --> 01:37:28.02 Go back to team, make sure they had food for the night and stuff.
01:37:28.02 --> 01:37:32.02 And then go back for a final after action report,
01:37:32.02 --> 01:37:36.02 which would go through talking about everything from the vegetation,
01:37:36.02 --> 01:37:39.02 the type of hills, animals you encountered.
01:37:39.02 --> 01:37:42.02 All that kind of just crazy stuff. The fauna.
01:37:42.02 --> 01:37:45.02 Oh my god. The questions to you as it was just,
01:37:45.02 --> 01:37:47.02 if the wild was like always the same.
01:37:47.02 --> 01:37:49.02 It was the layoffs. Yeah, triple canopy.
01:37:49.02 --> 01:37:52.02 It's pretty dangerous. The NBA are pretty dedicated.
01:37:52.02 --> 01:37:56.02 And then anything specific solved the target from that
01:37:56.02 --> 01:38:01.02 to take a learn from. How long are you going to take you to become the one zero?
01:38:01.02 --> 01:38:06.02 Well, in my case, a gotten country in May.
01:38:06.02 --> 01:38:10.02 Despite putting on a team at the end of May, we trained Juniors L.I.
01:38:10.02 --> 01:38:14.02 had a couple in country like L'Oyem, Bush's locally.
01:38:14.02 --> 01:38:19.02 And then we had a practice mission in August.
01:38:19.02 --> 01:38:21.02 And then we did it. First wiretap.
01:38:21.02 --> 01:38:23.02 And not a wiretap, but the Air Force sensors.
01:38:23.02 --> 01:38:25.02 We did two of those missions in September.
01:38:25.02 --> 01:38:27.02 We had them on soon, too.
01:38:27.02 --> 01:38:30.02 So a lot of those little between the rain. We had like weeks.
01:38:30.02 --> 01:38:33.02 We were just rain. It seemed like a rain every day.
01:38:33.02 --> 01:38:37.02 You ever see who horizontal rain?
01:38:37.02 --> 01:38:39.02 Yeah.
01:38:39.02 --> 01:38:40.02 I've seen this much.
01:38:40.02 --> 01:38:42.02 You guys would not run missions during the monsters.
01:38:42.02 --> 01:38:43.02 No.
01:38:43.02 --> 01:38:44.02 You're too much.
01:38:44.02 --> 01:38:45.02 Too much.
01:38:45.02 --> 01:38:46.02 You're going to be too bad.
01:38:46.02 --> 01:38:47.02 You're socked.
01:38:47.02 --> 01:38:48.02 You're socked.
01:38:48.02 --> 01:38:49.02 You couldn't get out of the base.
01:38:49.02 --> 01:38:51.02 The king, he couldn't get to the base.
01:38:51.02 --> 01:38:53.02 So how long, so how long was that?
01:38:53.02 --> 01:38:55.02 Like four months before you were?
01:38:55.02 --> 01:38:56.02 Yeah.
01:38:56.02 --> 01:38:57.02 Four months.
01:38:57.02 --> 01:39:02.02 And how many missions did you run before you were a one zero?
01:39:02.02 --> 01:39:04.02 I had five missions out of my belt.
01:39:04.02 --> 01:39:08.02 We had a two practice, two wiretaps,
01:39:08.02 --> 01:39:11.02 and a dawn, walkin, echo four.
01:39:11.02 --> 01:39:15.02 And by that time, when he came to me, he said,
01:39:15.02 --> 01:39:18.02 you know, walkin got promoted to a cubby rider.
01:39:18.02 --> 01:39:21.02 And because Pat Walkas was leaving,
01:39:21.02 --> 01:39:22.02 there's an opening.
01:39:22.02 --> 01:39:25.02 So he went there and they gave me the option.
01:39:25.02 --> 01:39:26.02 Are you ready?
01:39:26.02 --> 01:39:29.02 Well, we see what happened with Alabama with Lynn Black,
01:39:29.02 --> 01:39:34.02 in October when they put a guy on a team that didn't had no experience.
01:39:34.02 --> 01:39:37.02 So I talked it over with happened south.
01:39:37.02 --> 01:39:39.02 I saw a look just a situation.
01:39:39.02 --> 01:39:41.02 I don't know who they're going to give us.
01:39:41.02 --> 01:39:44.02 So what about I'll be the ones here on spider.
01:39:44.02 --> 01:39:47.02 I thought that was okay to do it.
01:39:47.02 --> 01:39:48.02 Talk to Walkins.
01:39:48.02 --> 01:39:51.02 And they all said, well, you're ready.
01:39:51.02 --> 01:39:53.02 If you want to try it.
01:39:53.02 --> 01:39:57.02 And we didn't know who could they had to do people coming in the camp.
01:39:57.02 --> 01:40:01.02 And some of these guys were the older ones who had no experience in the layoffs.
01:40:01.02 --> 01:40:03.02 But they didn't want to think to do with them.
01:40:03.02 --> 01:40:05.02 And it had some of the younger guys who were coming in.
01:40:05.02 --> 01:40:09.02 Like Jim Robison, who was on the team.
01:40:09.02 --> 01:40:11.02 For one mission.
01:40:11.02 --> 01:40:14.02 And we didn't know how to withstand up.
01:40:14.02 --> 01:40:16.02 So our guys were happy.
01:40:16.02 --> 01:40:17.02 And the bubbly came in.
01:40:17.02 --> 01:40:21.02 Bubba and the guy named Defranceman Doug Leterna,
01:40:21.02 --> 01:40:23.02 the Frenchman came in together.
01:40:23.02 --> 01:40:25.02 And the Frenchman got picked for Virginia.
01:40:25.02 --> 01:40:27.02 And I got Bubba.
01:40:27.02 --> 01:40:29.02 They were buddies. They got me training group together.
01:40:29.02 --> 01:40:31.02 Yeah, that's, yeah.
01:40:31.02 --> 01:40:35.02 So you'd been in the army for like a couple years.
01:40:35.02 --> 01:40:39.02 And you were in charge of a re-conte.
01:40:39.02 --> 01:40:40.02 Yeah, got in the army.
01:40:40.02 --> 01:40:43.02 December 66 became a one-to-year-old October 68.
01:40:43.02 --> 01:40:45.02 So you figure...
01:40:45.02 --> 01:40:45.02 Three years.
01:40:45.02 --> 01:40:47.02 Almost two years, yeah.
01:40:47.02 --> 01:40:52.02 Because the whole SF training, between that and going through basic jump school.
01:40:52.02 --> 01:40:55.02 And then we had that training before Vietnam,
01:40:55.02 --> 01:40:58.02 the RTT training, which was different.
01:40:58.02 --> 01:41:01.02 But that's just because we're common geeks.
01:41:01.02 --> 01:41:02.02 Mm-hmm.
01:41:02.02 --> 01:41:04.02 Oh, the RTT training was just radio.
01:41:04.02 --> 01:41:06.02 Radio tall type. Got it.
01:41:06.02 --> 01:41:09.02 They want a top secret clearance men on those machines.
01:41:09.02 --> 01:41:15.02 How much did you see the tactics that you guys were using?
01:41:15.02 --> 01:41:18.02 Change over time.
01:41:18.02 --> 01:41:24.02 Um, I think by the time, like when you read, we few by Nick Brockhausen.
01:41:24.02 --> 01:41:30.02 Some of those guys were all carrying either RPDs or an M60.
01:41:30.02 --> 01:41:31.02 Mm-hmm.
01:41:31.02 --> 01:41:33.02 So they were just going in heavier.
01:41:33.02 --> 01:41:36.02 And, um, they were going to bigger team.
01:41:36.02 --> 01:41:37.02 Mm-hmm.
01:41:37.02 --> 01:41:41.02 And, um, they were just anticipating the contact more.
01:41:41.02 --> 01:41:45.02 Whereas we thought we were trying to go in and try to escape and evade.
01:41:45.02 --> 01:41:46.02 Mm-hmm.
01:41:46.02 --> 01:41:48.02 To a point where you hope that you can get these some in the mission done.
01:41:48.02 --> 01:41:52.02 Or to get some intel reports about troop movements, trucks, stuff like that.
01:41:52.02 --> 01:41:54.02 Or get a good wiretap.
01:41:54.02 --> 01:41:59.02 So the biggest thing that changed was the guy started going in heavier and actually bringing
01:41:59.02 --> 01:42:03.02 automatic weapons or belt-fed machine guns.
01:42:03.02 --> 01:42:04.02 Sure.
01:42:04.02 --> 01:42:05.02 That makes sense.
01:42:05.02 --> 01:42:07.02 Every single time I read any of your operations,
01:42:07.02 --> 01:42:11.02 I want nothing more than a belt-fed machine gun.
01:42:11.02 --> 01:42:13.02 So the weaves, if we didn't know who's going to carry it.
01:42:13.02 --> 01:42:15.02 Yeah, the seals had the stoner.
01:42:15.02 --> 01:42:16.02 Oh, yeah.
01:42:16.02 --> 01:42:18.02 Did you guys ever think about using that?
01:42:18.02 --> 01:42:19.02 We thought about it a lot.
01:42:19.02 --> 01:42:21.02 But, and it was a great system.
01:42:21.02 --> 01:42:24.02 We heard many great reports about it.
01:42:24.02 --> 01:42:27.02 But again, the stoner system, you need the audio ammo.
01:42:27.02 --> 01:42:30.02 You had to get the supply system set up.
01:42:30.02 --> 01:42:33.02 And we just weren't sure if we were going to be able to get the guarantee.
01:42:33.02 --> 01:42:36.02 If we convert it, who would it be just the Americans?
01:42:36.02 --> 01:42:39.02 We want everybody with common weapons.
01:42:39.02 --> 01:42:41.02 So that somebody who's blown up, they're weapon,
01:42:41.02 --> 01:42:44.02 because they know how to use the other guy's weapon.
01:42:44.02 --> 01:42:46.02 And you have the same magazine saying that.
01:42:46.02 --> 01:42:47.02 Everything.
01:42:47.02 --> 01:42:48.02 Sure.
01:42:48.02 --> 01:42:53.02 And what about the mission set itself?
01:42:53.02 --> 01:42:59.02 Did you guys, did you notice that change over time while you were there?
01:42:59.02 --> 01:43:03.02 Later we began to get more point targets like in on a ground.
01:43:03.02 --> 01:43:06.02 One of my favorite stories was the Frenchman.
01:43:06.02 --> 01:43:10.02 He goes into a seal-type mission.
01:43:10.02 --> 01:43:13.02 The CIA comes and says, we know about the NVA.
01:43:13.02 --> 01:43:17.02 They're floating 55 gallon drums down the river
01:43:17.02 --> 01:43:19.02 and to a storage area.
01:43:19.02 --> 01:43:21.02 Deep and lay us.
01:43:21.02 --> 01:43:23.02 So we want you guys to go in.
01:43:23.02 --> 01:43:25.02 But we don't trust you with the device.
01:43:25.02 --> 01:43:29.02 They had a device that they screwed into a 55 gallon drum.
01:43:29.02 --> 01:43:31.02 So what we're going to do is,
01:43:31.02 --> 01:43:33.02 and that would be like a tracking device?
01:43:33.02 --> 01:43:35.02 No, no, explosive in nature.
01:43:35.02 --> 01:43:36.02 Oh, that's right. That's right.
01:43:36.02 --> 01:43:37.02 Yeah, that's okay.
01:43:37.02 --> 01:43:42.02 So here's what says, we're going to meet you on this hilltop in Lay Us.
01:43:42.02 --> 01:43:46.02 So Doug was the one-one on our TV Junior.
01:43:46.02 --> 01:43:48.02 Got their wall was the one-zero.
01:43:48.02 --> 01:43:50.02 They'd go in and hump three days.
01:43:50.02 --> 01:43:51.02 Get to the mountaintop.
01:43:51.02 --> 01:43:53.02 There's the CIA.
01:43:53.02 --> 01:43:54.02 With a couple guys.
01:43:54.02 --> 01:43:56.02 Okay, here's your device.
01:43:56.02 --> 01:43:58.02 Go and stall it.
01:43:58.02 --> 01:44:02.02 Now, come to the wall with the Marine. So you think that he'd be the guy doing a swimming, right?
01:44:02.02 --> 01:44:04.02 He goes, omınise six.
01:44:04.02 --> 01:44:06.02 Frenchman, you're an E4.
01:44:06.02 --> 01:44:08.02 Hit the work.
01:44:08.02 --> 01:44:10.02 So the CIA gave the Disclosive device,
01:44:10.02 --> 01:44:12.02 humped down the mount and get to the river
01:44:12.02 --> 01:44:16.02 and then now they're on a river with all the stuff going by the drums.
01:44:16.02 --> 01:44:20.02 And some have NVA troops riding the drums
01:44:20.02 --> 01:44:22.02 or being present with a boat or something.
01:44:22.02 --> 01:44:25.02 So in between all this, Doug strips down,
01:44:25.02 --> 01:44:29.02 goes in, gets a drum, brings it back, puts in the explosive device.
01:44:29.02 --> 01:44:35.02 Swims it back out and comes back, soaking wet and not happy.
01:44:35.02 --> 01:44:38.02 He's for something California.
01:44:38.02 --> 01:44:40.02 So he's really not happy.
01:44:40.02 --> 01:44:44.02 But two days later, they're getting extracted now.
01:44:44.02 --> 01:44:47.02 The King Beast come extracted and they're getting
01:44:47.02 --> 01:44:50.02 the extracted as his use explosion.
01:44:50.02 --> 01:44:54.02 And it had sonic boom that Lily moved the aircraft
01:44:54.02 --> 01:44:57.02 and the guys running the strings swinging from the sonic boom
01:44:57.02 --> 01:45:00.02 look back there goes a fuel dump.
01:45:00.02 --> 01:45:01.02 Wow.
01:45:01.02 --> 01:45:02.02 Beautiful mission.
01:45:02.02 --> 01:45:03.02 Yeah, that's true.
01:45:03.02 --> 01:45:04.02 So those are kind.
01:45:04.02 --> 01:45:06.02 So the point mission, the wire taps, you can
01:45:06.02 --> 01:45:09.02 pipe lines, we have more reports of pipe lines.
01:45:09.02 --> 01:45:12.02 And then also there are doing some trail work trying to figure out
01:45:12.02 --> 01:45:15.02 how to look like a beer stream.
01:45:15.02 --> 01:45:18.02 But they had things, that's one of our missions of what the work
01:45:18.02 --> 01:45:19.02 of the mission.
01:45:19.02 --> 01:45:20.02 Yeah.
01:45:20.02 --> 01:45:22.02 To get in there to see how to go into the food,
01:45:22.02 --> 01:45:24.02 putter and could you go in and while you're there,
01:45:24.02 --> 01:45:26.02 blow it up, maybe with a chuck on it.
01:45:26.02 --> 01:45:27.02 Sure.
01:45:27.02 --> 01:45:31.02 Let's talk a little bit about gear.
01:45:31.02 --> 01:45:34.02 And you put, you actually have a section in saw
01:45:34.02 --> 01:45:36.02 Chronicles and it's in across defense too, where you talk about
01:45:36.02 --> 01:45:39.02 stuff you carry and stuff that you didn't carry.
01:45:39.02 --> 01:45:42.02 And some of the stuff that you didn't carry.
01:45:42.02 --> 01:45:44.02 No underwear.
01:45:44.02 --> 01:45:45.02 Never.
01:45:45.02 --> 01:45:46.02 No socks.
01:45:46.02 --> 01:45:47.02 Never.
01:45:47.02 --> 01:45:51.02 And that's because you just want to stay dry as much as
01:45:51.02 --> 01:45:52.02 possible.
01:45:52.02 --> 01:45:53.02 Yeah.
01:45:53.02 --> 01:45:56.02 And both those things just hold water and keep moisture in.
01:45:56.02 --> 01:45:57.02 Yeah.
01:45:57.02 --> 01:46:00.02 And then black when he came,
01:46:00.02 --> 01:46:03.02 or had a maid that was stealing all my underwear.
01:46:03.02 --> 01:46:05.02 Because I went over with eight or ten pair of the
01:46:05.02 --> 01:46:07.02 jockey shorts, right?
01:46:07.02 --> 01:46:10.02 And so I was down on my last pair.
01:46:10.02 --> 01:46:12.02 And the maid was literally stealing, could they
01:46:12.02 --> 01:46:14.02 sell one of black market, they're relatively clean,
01:46:14.02 --> 01:46:15.02 relatively new.
01:46:15.02 --> 01:46:18.02 Mom bought me a whole bunch of stuff with socks and everything.
01:46:18.02 --> 01:46:20.02 So we had our army socks.
01:46:20.02 --> 01:46:22.02 So anyways, I talked to the men.
01:46:22.02 --> 01:46:25.02 I said, I can't believe my maid's been stealing my underwear.
01:46:25.02 --> 01:46:27.02 Because we pulled down in a little eye down.
01:46:27.02 --> 01:46:28.02 There's my underwear.
01:46:28.02 --> 01:46:31.02 So I said, here, take the last one, have a good day.
01:46:31.02 --> 01:46:33.02 And lingo, don't wear that stuff because you get
01:46:33.02 --> 01:46:35.02 jungle rotten, crotch rot.
01:46:35.02 --> 01:46:39.02 And he says same thing, put away your socks.
01:46:39.02 --> 01:46:42.02 Well, you know, it first couple weeks, the jungle boots were
01:46:42.02 --> 01:46:44.02 really tough on my feet, but he was right.
01:46:44.02 --> 01:46:46.02 Yeah, once you get a bunch of your feet broken in and
01:46:46.02 --> 01:46:47.02 you jungle boots broken in.
01:46:47.02 --> 01:46:48.02 Yeah.
01:46:48.02 --> 01:46:51.02 And then say, you go through the water, we did some very
01:46:51.02 --> 01:46:52.02 in country stuff.
01:46:52.02 --> 01:46:53.02 We were in the rice patties.
01:46:53.02 --> 01:46:54.02 Oh my God.
01:46:54.02 --> 01:46:56.02 But they would dry out quicker.
01:46:56.02 --> 01:46:58.02 You'd have to worry about the socks.
01:46:58.02 --> 01:47:00.02 So no helmet.
01:47:00.02 --> 01:47:01.02 Never.
01:47:01.02 --> 01:47:02.02 No body armor.
01:47:02.02 --> 01:47:04.02 No, and your body armor sucked back.
01:47:04.02 --> 01:47:05.02 It sucked back.
01:47:05.02 --> 01:47:06.02 That was big.
01:47:06.02 --> 01:47:07.02 You just have you a different level.
01:47:07.02 --> 01:47:08.02 It didn't work.
01:47:08.02 --> 01:47:12.02 No entrenching tool.
01:47:12.02 --> 01:47:13.02 Never.
01:47:13.02 --> 01:47:16.02 No bay in that.
01:47:16.02 --> 01:47:18.02 No sleeping bag.
01:47:18.02 --> 01:47:19.02 No hammock.
01:47:19.02 --> 01:47:20.02 No poncho.
01:47:20.02 --> 01:47:21.02 No poncho.
01:47:21.02 --> 01:47:22.02 No ground bat.
01:47:22.02 --> 01:47:23.02 Correct.
01:47:23.02 --> 01:47:24.02 You were not traveling for comfort.
01:47:24.02 --> 01:47:25.02 Never.
01:47:25.02 --> 01:47:27.02 We had to carry it.
01:47:27.02 --> 01:47:29.02 Did you know that feeling?
01:47:29.02 --> 01:47:30.02 Yeah.
01:47:30.02 --> 01:47:32.02 What you're taking to the field, your carrying.
01:47:32.02 --> 01:47:33.02 You don't have your maverick.
01:47:33.02 --> 01:47:34.02 Yeah.
01:47:34.02 --> 01:47:36.02 That that rucksack gets heavy too.
01:47:36.02 --> 01:47:37.02 So quick.
01:47:37.02 --> 01:47:38.02 Yeah.
01:47:38.02 --> 01:47:40.02 And ours is like small.
01:47:40.02 --> 01:47:42.02 We had the indigenous rucksacks.
01:47:42.02 --> 01:47:43.02 Uh huh.
01:47:43.02 --> 01:47:45.02 And so you want you put the radio and put the sweater on the
01:47:45.02 --> 01:47:46.02 needle radio.
01:47:46.02 --> 01:47:48.02 So it protect your back.
01:47:48.02 --> 01:47:49.02 And they throw some rations.
01:47:49.02 --> 01:47:53.02 Extra couple of extra amma magazines in there.
01:47:53.02 --> 01:47:55.02 And then extra hand grenades.
01:47:55.02 --> 01:47:57.02 I'm setting on rounds.
01:47:57.02 --> 01:47:59.02 And a battery for good luck.
01:47:59.02 --> 01:48:00.02 Man.
01:48:00.02 --> 01:48:01.02 Yeah.
01:48:01.02 --> 01:48:03.02 You guys.
01:48:03.02 --> 01:48:04.02 No dog tags.
01:48:04.02 --> 01:48:06.02 No military idea of any kind.
01:48:06.02 --> 01:48:07.02 No rank.
01:48:07.02 --> 01:48:08.02 No name tags.
01:48:08.02 --> 01:48:09.02 No jump.
01:48:09.02 --> 01:48:10.02 No C.I.B.
01:48:10.02 --> 01:48:11.02 No patches.
01:48:11.02 --> 01:48:12.02 No unit identified.
01:48:12.02 --> 01:48:13.02 No pictures.
01:48:13.02 --> 01:48:14.02 No mama.
01:48:14.02 --> 01:48:15.02 Right.
01:48:15.02 --> 01:48:16.02 Totally select.
01:48:16.02 --> 01:48:18.02 So those are the things you didn't carry.
01:48:18.02 --> 01:48:19.02 Things you didn't carry.
01:48:19.02 --> 01:48:20.02 Car 15.
01:48:20.02 --> 01:48:21.02 Uh love it.
01:48:21.02 --> 01:48:22.02 You love the car 15.
01:48:22.02 --> 01:48:23.02 Oh yeah.
01:48:23.02 --> 01:48:25.02 So back my second tour.
01:48:25.02 --> 01:48:26.02 Rock Myers was in S4.
01:48:26.02 --> 01:48:29.02 He's he been wounded.
01:48:29.02 --> 01:48:30.02 I came back.
01:48:30.02 --> 01:48:31.02 He says you're back.
01:48:31.02 --> 01:48:32.02 I got a present for you.
01:48:32.02 --> 01:48:34.02 He gave me a brand new car 15.
01:48:34.02 --> 01:48:35.02 I was stolen the box.
01:48:35.02 --> 01:48:36.02 Take it out.
01:48:36.02 --> 01:48:39.02 It's stolen it all the 10 foil and all the oils and grease isn't stuff.
01:48:39.02 --> 01:48:40.02 And you take it out.
01:48:40.02 --> 01:48:41.02 Took it down through range.
01:48:41.02 --> 01:48:42.02 It was perfectly zero.
01:48:42.02 --> 01:48:43.02 Never touched that one.
01:48:43.02 --> 01:48:44.02 It was crazy.
01:48:44.02 --> 01:48:48.02 Just put a little claw strap on it and went to work.
01:48:48.02 --> 01:48:51.02 And you never had problems with that weapon.
01:48:51.02 --> 01:48:52.02 Never.
01:48:52.02 --> 01:48:53.02 Yeah.
01:48:53.02 --> 01:48:56.02 Did you have a four to six on it?
01:48:56.02 --> 01:48:57.02 Yep.
01:48:57.02 --> 01:48:58.02 Six four to six.
01:48:58.02 --> 01:48:59.02 Yeah.
01:48:59.02 --> 01:49:01.02 So that was a car 15.
01:49:01.02 --> 01:49:02.02 Wow.
01:49:02.02 --> 01:49:04.02 So the M16 with it with a classable stock.
01:49:04.02 --> 01:49:05.02 Yeah.
01:49:05.02 --> 01:49:06.02 And a shortened barrel.
01:49:06.02 --> 01:49:07.02 Yeah.
01:49:07.02 --> 01:49:11.02 So it's weird so many people and myself being one of them complain about the car.
01:49:11.02 --> 01:49:14.02 The car 15 or the M4 frame.
01:49:14.02 --> 01:49:15.02 Now the M4 is our lot nicer.
01:49:15.02 --> 01:49:16.02 I mean, the M4.
01:49:16.02 --> 01:49:17.02 Well, a lot heavier too.
01:49:17.02 --> 01:49:18.02 You got to reels and everything.
01:49:18.02 --> 01:49:19.02 Oh yeah.
01:49:19.02 --> 01:49:20.02 We put the light note thing.
01:49:20.02 --> 01:49:21.02 Those are the same.
01:49:21.02 --> 01:49:23.02 You got everything but a cigarette lighter on here.
01:49:23.02 --> 01:49:27.02 Some guys I would've resized it and then that on there too.
01:49:27.02 --> 01:49:28.02 So that's awesome.
01:49:28.02 --> 01:49:30.02 You used the Kravat for your sling.
01:49:30.02 --> 01:49:31.02 Yes.
01:49:31.02 --> 01:49:32.02 So I thought, well, yeah.
01:49:32.02 --> 01:49:34.02 I did that door my second door.
01:49:34.02 --> 01:49:36.02 They had the Kravat's quiet.
01:49:36.02 --> 01:49:40.02 And then God forbid if you ever needed a Kravat.
01:49:40.02 --> 01:49:41.02 Mm-hmm.
01:49:41.02 --> 01:49:42.02 Because I was carried out.
01:49:42.02 --> 01:49:43.02 I always wore a run around my neck.
01:49:43.02 --> 01:49:45.02 I had one on my head.
01:49:45.02 --> 01:49:46.02 And then one on the car 15.
01:49:46.02 --> 01:49:48.02 And of course you carried bandages.
01:49:48.02 --> 01:49:49.02 Yeah.
01:49:49.02 --> 01:49:50.02 We had Kravats in case it.
01:49:50.02 --> 01:49:51.02 As at the very bottom of the rock sack.
01:49:51.02 --> 01:49:55.02 We would get a sort of one of those things.
01:49:55.02 --> 01:49:57.02 They'd never wear a sling.
01:49:57.02 --> 01:49:58.02 Some guys would say that.
01:49:58.02 --> 01:49:59.02 Get caught up.
01:49:59.02 --> 01:50:03.02 And that's just man, especially when you're in a leadership position.
01:50:03.02 --> 01:50:04.02 You need a sling.
01:50:04.02 --> 01:50:05.02 Because you got to look at your map.
01:50:05.02 --> 01:50:06.02 You got to pull out.
01:50:06.02 --> 01:50:07.02 You know.
01:50:07.02 --> 01:50:08.02 Yeah.
01:50:08.02 --> 01:50:09.02 You got to do stuff.
01:50:09.02 --> 01:50:11.02 You don't have a sling and you get blown up.
01:50:11.02 --> 01:50:12.02 Yeah.
01:50:12.02 --> 01:50:13.02 Where's your weapon?
01:50:13.02 --> 01:50:15.02 You have no idea when you wake up.
01:50:15.02 --> 01:50:16.02 No.
01:50:16.02 --> 01:50:17.02 Yeah.
01:50:17.02 --> 01:50:21.02 But then there's some, you know, some people just they wouldn't carry a sling.
01:50:21.02 --> 01:50:23.02 Mark leaves one of my shing on her sheep.
01:50:23.02 --> 01:50:24.02 Just no sling.
01:50:24.02 --> 01:50:25.02 No.
01:50:25.02 --> 01:50:26.02 That was like a man thing to do was no sling.
01:50:26.02 --> 01:50:27.02 Yeah.
01:50:27.02 --> 01:50:28.02 On her 1060.
01:50:28.02 --> 01:50:30.02 Or these days of Mark 48.
01:50:30.02 --> 01:50:31.02 Really?
01:50:31.02 --> 01:50:32.02 Yeah.
01:50:32.02 --> 01:50:33.02 How strong is this guy?
01:50:33.02 --> 01:50:34.02 Strong.
01:50:34.02 --> 01:50:35.02 Yeah.
01:50:35.02 --> 01:50:36.02 Strong.
01:50:36.02 --> 01:50:37.02 M-79.
01:50:37.02 --> 01:50:38.02 You carried.
01:50:38.02 --> 01:50:39.02 Sawdolph.
01:50:39.02 --> 01:50:40.02 Oh, yes.
01:50:40.02 --> 01:50:44.02 I cannot believe that me and my guy is the not-thinker sawdolph for him.
01:50:44.02 --> 01:50:45.02 Yeah.
01:50:45.02 --> 01:50:46.02 It's like guaranteed guys with the sawdolph.
01:50:46.02 --> 01:50:47.02 Yeah.
01:50:47.02 --> 01:50:50.02 My first self-inflicted room was from a sawdolph M79.
01:50:50.02 --> 01:50:51.02 What'd you do?
01:50:51.02 --> 01:50:53.02 Well, we're in a process.
01:50:53.02 --> 01:50:54.02 We're cutting them down.
01:50:54.02 --> 01:50:55.02 Uh-huh.
01:50:55.02 --> 01:50:57.02 So the question was how far he cut the barrel down.
01:50:57.02 --> 01:51:00.02 So we finally cut it right down to the last hinge.
01:51:00.02 --> 01:51:01.02 Mm-hmm.
01:51:01.02 --> 01:51:02.02 We're.
01:51:02.02 --> 01:51:03.02 It's the last one.
01:51:03.02 --> 01:51:04.02 That's, yeah.
01:51:04.02 --> 01:51:06.02 That's to the bottom of the frame.
01:51:06.02 --> 01:51:07.02 Got it.
01:51:07.02 --> 01:51:08.02 Yeah.
01:51:08.02 --> 01:51:10.02 So we, we kept bringing it back.
01:51:10.02 --> 01:51:11.02 So we're down to range.
01:51:11.02 --> 01:51:12.02 We're there.
01:51:12.02 --> 01:51:15.02 And the question was because you cut the barrel off.
01:51:15.02 --> 01:51:17.02 It needs the number of rotations.
01:51:17.02 --> 01:51:18.02 Yeah.
01:51:18.02 --> 01:51:20.02 Now our, our weapons guys knew that.
01:51:20.02 --> 01:51:22.02 But I was mean, Rick Howard, we're common guys.
01:51:22.02 --> 01:51:23.02 And I didn't really ask.
01:51:23.02 --> 01:51:25.02 It's just the question was fire and sea.
01:51:25.02 --> 01:51:29.02 So on this day, I fired, fairly close.
01:51:29.02 --> 01:51:32.02 It goes being, you know,
01:51:32.02 --> 01:51:34.02 I know he's inside of the night makes.
01:51:34.02 --> 01:51:35.02 And then it went all like pop,
01:51:35.02 --> 01:51:37.02 being like that.
01:51:37.02 --> 01:51:39.02 And I go, oh, damn.
01:51:39.02 --> 01:51:40.02 So I go to Rick Howard.
01:51:40.02 --> 01:51:42.02 I think a bead just hit me.
01:51:42.02 --> 01:51:43.02 Pull my strip.
01:51:43.02 --> 01:51:44.02 He dumbass.
01:51:44.02 --> 01:51:45.02 He just shot yourself.
01:51:45.02 --> 01:51:47.02 My first self inflicted moon.
01:51:47.02 --> 01:51:49.02 But the good news was that I'm sitting on work.
01:51:49.02 --> 01:51:52.02 And they caused you to cut the handle down to just have enough
01:51:52.02 --> 01:51:54.02 to you could hold on to.
01:51:54.02 --> 01:51:56.02 Because that way is less less weapon.
01:51:56.02 --> 01:51:57.02 Yeah.
01:51:57.02 --> 01:51:58.02 He's to how long the firepower.
01:51:58.02 --> 01:51:59.02 Oh, yeah.
01:51:59.02 --> 01:52:01.02 I caught that weapon down by half.
01:52:01.02 --> 01:52:02.02 Oh, yeah.
01:52:02.02 --> 01:52:03.02 I was looking at the pictures you have.
01:52:03.02 --> 01:52:05.02 It's, that thing is tiny.
01:52:05.02 --> 01:52:07.02 Tiny but effective.
01:52:07.02 --> 01:52:09.02 Charlie hated those things.
01:52:09.02 --> 01:52:12.02 And at one point you had a, you had a holster for that thing.
01:52:12.02 --> 01:52:13.02 Yeah.
01:52:13.02 --> 01:52:14.02 That's John Wayne.
01:52:14.02 --> 01:52:16.02 That's the, that's the one layoffs with my,
01:52:16.02 --> 01:52:17.02 a dog knife.
01:52:17.02 --> 01:52:20.02 And I had somebody had crafted it.
01:52:20.02 --> 01:52:21.02 And I put it on.
01:52:21.02 --> 01:52:23.02 Yeah, that was perfect.
01:52:23.02 --> 01:52:24.02 Yeah.
01:52:24.02 --> 01:52:25.02 But never had a double.
01:52:25.02 --> 01:52:27.02 For that point, I just like everybody else.
01:52:27.02 --> 01:52:30.02 We just carried it on the deering.
01:52:30.02 --> 01:52:32.02 We taped it so it would be quiet though.
01:52:32.02 --> 01:52:36.02 You carried 34 20 round mags.
01:52:36.02 --> 01:52:38.02 Each pat, each with 18 rounds each.
01:52:38.02 --> 01:52:41.02 So that's 612 rounds for good luck.
01:52:41.02 --> 01:52:42.02 Yeah.
01:52:42.02 --> 01:52:47.02 That's not the only character or like a pouts with a couple extra clips.
01:52:47.02 --> 01:52:50.02 And in case we needed to reload the 34 magazines.
01:52:50.02 --> 01:52:52.02 And you went on.
01:52:52.02 --> 01:52:56.02 You mentioned you had few missions where you were down to your last one or two.
01:52:56.02 --> 01:52:59.02 At least twice that I remember echo four was the first time.
01:52:59.02 --> 01:53:04.02 Did you always hang onto your magazines when you were out?
01:53:04.02 --> 01:53:08.02 At dependent on the degree of intensity of the firefight.
01:53:08.02 --> 01:53:11.02 If I had time, we keep us for a happy.
01:53:11.02 --> 01:53:13.02 I'll bring back my damn magazines.
01:53:13.02 --> 01:53:14.02 Did you stuff from your shirt?
01:53:14.02 --> 01:53:15.02 Yeah.
01:53:15.02 --> 01:53:16.02 Yeah.
01:53:16.02 --> 01:53:18.02 Because the web gear would be tight.
01:53:18.02 --> 01:53:22.02 So our jungle fatigue were out.
01:53:22.02 --> 01:53:23.02 Yeah.
01:53:23.02 --> 01:53:27.02 So you had the pants, but then the harness from the web gear.
01:53:27.02 --> 01:53:28.02 Yeah.
01:53:28.02 --> 01:53:29.02 And the web gear would be the only thing in.
01:53:29.02 --> 01:53:32.02 When I came in, we'd stuff mags in our shirt.
01:53:32.02 --> 01:53:35.02 And then, but with body armor, you can't do that.
01:53:35.02 --> 01:53:39.02 So now that's carry like pouches or just dropping their leg cargo pockets or whatever.
01:53:39.02 --> 01:53:40.02 Yeah.
01:53:40.02 --> 01:53:44.02 Our preferred thing would be AR belts because you could put four magazines in and one
01:53:44.02 --> 01:53:45.02 across the top.
01:53:45.02 --> 01:53:46.02 And it was a nice pouch.
01:53:46.02 --> 01:53:49.02 The AR belts that they have from World War II.
01:53:49.02 --> 01:53:53.02 Perfect for the 20 round magazines.
01:53:53.02 --> 01:53:56.02 That's a lot of, just, you know, we would normally carry.
01:53:56.02 --> 01:54:00.02 Seven to ten, 30 round mags.
01:54:00.02 --> 01:54:06.02 So we carry like, I mean, sometimes I guess more than that, but not no 600 rounds.
01:54:06.02 --> 01:54:08.02 But you weren't just being alone for a while.
01:54:08.02 --> 01:54:11.02 No, we weren't fighting divisions worth the people either.
01:54:11.02 --> 01:54:14.02 So I mean, yeah.
01:54:14.02 --> 01:54:18.02 You know, and I guess we did what we did have is we always had heavy machine guns.
01:54:18.02 --> 01:54:20.02 You know, so that makes a big difference too.
01:54:20.02 --> 01:54:25.02 I guess, you know, we would have Mark 48, which is 762 and then the Mark 46, which is
01:54:25.02 --> 01:54:31.02 556, you know, that's basically like a little stoner and a and a and 60.
01:54:31.02 --> 01:54:33.02 The modern versions of those two things.
01:54:33.02 --> 01:54:35.02 But yeah, you know, so we had a sol 2, right?
01:54:35.02 --> 01:54:38.02 Yeah, well, that's the Mark 46 is a saw.
01:54:38.02 --> 01:54:39.02 Yeah.
01:54:39.02 --> 01:54:39.02 Okay.
01:54:39.02 --> 01:54:40.02 Yeah.
01:54:40.02 --> 01:54:41.02 Yes.
01:54:41.02 --> 01:54:46.02 So we had those and those guys would carry a lot of rounds, a lot of rounds, like 800
01:54:46.02 --> 01:54:48.02 2000, sometimes more on the outside.
01:54:48.02 --> 01:54:51.02 Yeah, what's tough on the character like that over a thousand.
01:54:51.02 --> 01:54:52.02 Yeah.
01:54:52.02 --> 01:54:56.02 And I had guys go winchester, go run out of bullets.
01:54:56.02 --> 01:54:57.02 Really?
01:54:57.02 --> 01:54:57.02 Yeah.
01:54:57.02 --> 01:54:58.02 With that many.
01:54:58.02 --> 01:55:02.02 So yeah, I guess maybe that was the the differentiator.
01:55:02.02 --> 01:55:07.02 You carry 10 to 12 fragments.
01:55:07.02 --> 01:55:09.02 That's a lot of fragments.
01:55:09.02 --> 01:55:12.02 I guess when you're going taking fights with divisions, you got to carry a lot of
01:55:12.02 --> 01:55:13.02 Frag grenades.
01:55:13.02 --> 01:55:14.02 Oh, yeah.
01:55:14.02 --> 01:55:16.02 And it always kept the last one.
01:55:16.02 --> 01:55:18.02 That was one up here.
01:55:18.02 --> 01:55:19.02 Just in case.
01:55:19.02 --> 01:55:20.02 I must be a POW.
01:55:20.02 --> 01:55:22.02 Oh, yeah.
01:55:22.02 --> 01:55:24.02 Absolutely.
01:55:24.02 --> 01:55:27.02 We would carry, I don't know.
01:55:27.02 --> 01:55:30.02 Well, I would carry like one or two.
01:55:30.02 --> 01:55:31.02 Well, how often would you be?
01:55:31.02 --> 01:55:32.02 I just got left at that.
01:55:32.02 --> 01:55:33.02 It's official.
01:55:33.02 --> 01:55:34.02 Sure.
01:55:34.02 --> 01:55:35.02 I don't laugh that.
01:55:35.02 --> 01:55:38.02 How often would you, how often would you be more than two of them?
01:55:38.02 --> 01:55:39.02 Hopefully never.
01:55:39.02 --> 01:55:40.02 Yeah.
01:55:40.02 --> 01:55:42.02 You know, and especially I'm going to leadership position.
01:55:42.02 --> 01:55:45.02 I'm hopefully not the hucking grenades.
01:55:45.02 --> 01:55:47.02 But, uh, yeah.
01:55:47.02 --> 01:55:51.02 Yeah.
01:55:51.02 --> 01:55:53.02 No, you know, the big difference, especially in Romadi.
01:55:53.02 --> 01:55:56.02 I mean, in Romadi, I remember explaining to the guys that relieved us.
01:55:56.02 --> 01:55:59.02 You know, we had a big overhead imagery.
01:55:59.02 --> 01:56:00.02 Yeah.
01:56:00.02 --> 01:56:01.02 And I put my hand on the map.
01:56:01.02 --> 01:56:04.02 And I said, no matter where you put your hand on this map, you'll be touching
01:56:04.02 --> 01:56:06.02 up front of the unit.
01:56:06.02 --> 01:56:09.02 So like, and you know, this is, you know, probably within three to 500 meters of view.
01:56:09.02 --> 01:56:12.02 Anywhere you were in Romadi, yours are from the unit.
01:56:12.02 --> 01:56:13.02 Really.
01:56:13.02 --> 01:56:15.02 So that's why, you know, you were going to get reinforcements.
01:56:15.02 --> 01:56:16.02 You were going to get tanks.
01:56:16.02 --> 01:56:18.02 Yeah, but in between that time, you earned your pay.
01:56:18.02 --> 01:56:19.02 Yeah.
01:56:19.02 --> 01:56:20.02 After earn your pay.
01:56:20.02 --> 01:56:22.02 Yeah.
01:56:22.02 --> 01:56:23.02 Yeah.
01:56:23.02 --> 01:56:24.02 I was talking to late, late, late, late.
01:56:24.02 --> 01:56:25.02 Well, late, that's another thing.
01:56:25.02 --> 01:56:26.02 So it's late.
01:56:26.02 --> 01:56:28.02 Late, it's got a chapter in dichotomy and leadership.
01:56:28.02 --> 01:56:33.02 Where he's talking about preparing, over preparing for too many contingencies.
01:56:33.02 --> 01:56:38.02 He talks about, it was his first patrol out on, out going out with a Marine Corps
01:56:38.02 --> 01:56:39.02 in a daytime patrol.
01:56:39.02 --> 01:56:41.02 And he's talking about how much stuff he cared,
01:56:41.02 --> 01:56:45.02 all this stuff for one of the thing he cared is, you know, eight grenades or something like that.
01:56:45.02 --> 01:56:52.02 And, you know, he reflects on how that was just way too many of us like, hey man,
01:56:52.02 --> 01:56:55.02 you know, tilt, go out and the field will less than 10.
01:56:55.02 --> 01:57:00.02 So the different AO, different AO, different AO.
01:57:00.02 --> 01:57:02.02 We probably would have adjusted our grenades.
01:57:02.02 --> 01:57:05.02 I wonder how much you would have changed if you had to wear body armor.
01:57:05.02 --> 01:57:08.02 Or if you would have decided not to or whatever.
01:57:08.02 --> 01:57:09.02 You know, it's interesting.
01:57:09.02 --> 01:57:10.02 That's an interesting development.
01:57:10.02 --> 01:57:13.02 I'll tell you, if we even had today's stadium art,
01:57:13.02 --> 01:57:15.02 a never would have worn it.
01:57:15.02 --> 01:57:16.02 It's just too much weight.
01:57:16.02 --> 01:57:19.02 And you had to be able to move, I mean, you know,
01:57:19.02 --> 01:57:22.02 you have to mention, you're so damn lucky, you know, bullets are gonna hit you.
01:57:22.02 --> 01:57:23.02 Yeah.
01:57:23.02 --> 01:57:28.02 That's why I crawled a lot, try to keep the low profile.
01:57:28.02 --> 01:57:34.02 But now I probably would have declined it because of the weight as it was.
01:57:34.02 --> 01:57:39.02 In our AO, maybe another AO with different situations,
01:57:39.02 --> 01:57:42.02 more flexibility with assets.
01:57:42.02 --> 01:57:47.02 And the thing that's interesting is, one of the reasons why you wear a helmet now
01:57:47.02 --> 01:57:50.02 isn't just to protect your head, it's because that's where your nads mount onto.
01:57:50.02 --> 01:57:51.02 Your night vision.
01:57:51.02 --> 01:57:52.02 Oh, yeah.
01:57:52.02 --> 01:57:53.02 Your night vision mount onto your.
01:57:53.02 --> 01:57:57.02 So you, they do have a contraption that's like a headband looking thing.
01:57:57.02 --> 01:57:58.02 I don't think they make it anymore.
01:57:58.02 --> 01:58:02.02 But, but where you could wear that, but, you know, your nads mount on your.
01:58:02.02 --> 01:58:04.02 Your night vision mounts on your helmet.
01:58:04.02 --> 01:58:05.02 That's just the way it is.
01:58:05.02 --> 01:58:06.02 I've seen no silo.
01:58:06.02 --> 01:58:07.02 Yeah, that's what it got.
01:58:07.02 --> 01:58:08.02 It's a cool.
01:58:08.02 --> 01:58:09.02 I want one.
01:58:09.02 --> 01:58:10.02 Yeah.
01:58:10.02 --> 01:58:12.02 That's good time when those dots flip down.
01:58:12.02 --> 01:58:13.02 All right.
01:58:13.02 --> 01:58:16.02 But instead of wearing a helmet, you wore a crevat.
01:58:16.02 --> 01:58:20.02 The green crevat on your head, one around your neck.
01:58:20.02 --> 01:58:23.02 You had you wore regular army for teagues.
01:58:23.02 --> 01:58:29.02 Yeah, there is sterile for teagues that had two pucks at the top of the angle.
01:58:29.02 --> 01:58:32.02 And two pockets down here to hang out.
01:58:32.02 --> 01:58:34.02 And then we customized them.
01:58:34.02 --> 01:58:38.02 And we had the the tailor put in pockets here.
01:58:38.02 --> 01:58:41.02 And so for mirrors, maps, morphine, serbets,
01:58:41.02 --> 01:58:43.02 it's all close right here.
01:58:43.02 --> 01:58:46.02 And then we had a pockets on each arm.
01:58:46.02 --> 01:58:49.02 To put other things up there were pinflares.
01:58:49.02 --> 01:58:51.02 Other things are good.
01:58:51.02 --> 01:58:53.02 And that's something that we did too.
01:58:53.02 --> 01:58:56.02 So we did even before even in the 90s before the everyone.
01:58:56.02 --> 01:59:00.02 Because now the fatigue's come issued with pockets on the arms.
01:59:00.02 --> 01:59:03.02 I think, but we used to take them off and so on.
01:59:03.02 --> 01:59:07.02 And that's where you keep your your pants and your notebooks and your pen flares.
01:59:07.02 --> 01:59:09.02 And you're, and you're signal mirror.
01:59:09.02 --> 01:59:10.02 Yeah.
01:59:10.02 --> 01:59:12.02 And then on the ones on your chest, you had maps and morphine,
01:59:12.02 --> 01:59:13.02 you had extra notebook.
01:59:13.02 --> 01:59:16.02 Your URC 10 emergency radio.
01:59:16.02 --> 01:59:20.02 And then you had a, you wore a watch of sake.
01:59:20.02 --> 01:59:21.02 Yeah.
01:59:21.02 --> 01:59:23.02 Illuminus watch.
01:59:23.02 --> 01:59:25.02 You wore gloves.
01:59:25.02 --> 01:59:26.02 Always.
01:59:26.02 --> 01:59:29.02 Just cut out the thumb index finger,
01:59:29.02 --> 01:59:32.02 then the middle finger just cut it to the tip.
01:59:32.02 --> 01:59:35.02 So you grabbed tape on the magazine sort of firefights.
01:59:35.02 --> 01:59:36.02 Same thing, same thing we would do.
01:59:36.02 --> 01:59:39.02 But you always work gloves otherwise your hands are just getting destroyed.
01:59:39.02 --> 01:59:40.02 Oh, the jungle.
01:59:40.02 --> 01:59:41.02 Forget about it.
01:59:41.02 --> 01:59:41.02 Yeah.
01:59:41.02 --> 01:59:45.02 Because a lot of times we wind up, you have to get a new pair of gloves.
01:59:45.02 --> 01:59:49.02 We just get torn up so much on the genre and fatigues.
01:59:49.02 --> 01:59:53.02 Man, it was a weight of weight of an event and a thorns.
01:59:53.02 --> 01:59:55.02 Because you know, they're a weight of a minute.
01:59:55.02 --> 01:59:57.02 You get caught into it.
01:59:57.02 --> 01:59:58.02 You walk into it.
01:59:58.02 --> 02:00:01.02 Your leg goes into the pins that's coming together.
02:00:01.02 --> 02:00:04.02 So you had to stop and then get the pin to get your leg.
02:00:04.02 --> 02:00:05.02 Otherwise it goes to the pin.
02:00:05.02 --> 02:00:08.02 Otherwise it goes deeper into your leg.
02:00:08.02 --> 02:00:11.02 What about did you carry any kind of mosquito net for your head?
02:00:11.02 --> 02:00:12.02 No.
02:00:12.02 --> 02:00:13.02 How come?
02:00:13.02 --> 02:00:15.02 Never thought about it.
02:00:15.02 --> 02:00:16.02 Mosquito net for the head.
02:00:16.02 --> 02:00:17.02 Yeah.
02:00:17.02 --> 02:00:20.02 Well, I used to, this was like the most brilliant thing.
02:00:20.02 --> 02:00:21.02 I think it was an Australian guy.
02:00:21.02 --> 02:00:22.02 So I told me this.
02:00:22.02 --> 02:00:25.02 You, I would have like a little square of mosquito netting.
02:00:25.02 --> 02:00:26.02 Hmm.
02:00:26.02 --> 02:00:29.02 And when we would stop patrolling,
02:00:29.02 --> 02:00:32.02 I would take out that little square, put it over my head.
02:00:32.02 --> 02:00:34.02 Right over my right over my floppy hat.
02:00:34.02 --> 02:00:38.02 And talk it in and all of a sudden you knocking chewed apart by mosquitoes.
02:00:38.02 --> 02:00:42.02 Oh yeah, one night, one time we did a practice mission.
02:00:42.02 --> 02:00:43.02 East of the actual.
02:00:43.02 --> 02:00:46.02 And the morning I couldn't, I couldn't open my eyes.
02:00:46.02 --> 02:00:48.02 I had been bitten so much by mosquitoes.
02:00:48.02 --> 02:00:50.02 My face was puffed out.
02:00:50.02 --> 02:00:51.02 You need that mosquito net.
02:00:51.02 --> 02:00:52.02 I needed to help.
02:00:52.02 --> 02:00:54.02 Had I only known.
02:00:54.02 --> 02:00:55.02 I just got a fall of that.
02:00:55.02 --> 02:00:57.02 I just got a thought about that one.
02:00:57.02 --> 02:00:59.02 I had a guy we were doing some training.
02:00:59.02 --> 02:01:03.02 And none of us had mosquito netting except for the officer.
02:01:03.02 --> 02:01:05.02 And so the officer was sleeping hardly.
02:01:05.02 --> 02:01:06.02 Like just fully.
02:01:06.02 --> 02:01:11.02 And one of the other young listed guys was catching mosquitoes.
02:01:11.02 --> 02:01:15.02 And putting them inside this guy's body was asleep.
02:01:15.02 --> 02:01:18.02 He woke up coming.
02:01:18.02 --> 02:01:21.02 But not like those mosquitoes were trapped in there with them.
02:01:21.02 --> 02:01:22.02 They were trapped in there.
02:01:22.02 --> 02:01:23.02 And they couldn't get out.
02:01:23.02 --> 02:01:24.02 They were just having a feast.
02:01:24.02 --> 02:01:25.02 Trapped hungry mosquitoes.
02:01:25.02 --> 02:01:26.02 Trapped hungry mosquitoes.
02:01:26.02 --> 02:01:27.02 Yeah.
02:01:27.02 --> 02:01:28.02 Yeah.
02:01:28.02 --> 02:01:29.02 So, but note not for you.
02:01:29.02 --> 02:01:30.02 No mosquito net.
02:01:30.02 --> 02:01:31.02 No.
02:01:31.02 --> 02:01:34.02 I hadn't thought about that one.
02:01:34.02 --> 02:01:35.02 Leachers.
02:01:35.02 --> 02:01:36.02 Oh.
02:01:36.02 --> 02:01:39.02 You guys ran into a lot of leaches.
02:01:39.02 --> 02:01:40.02 Always.
02:01:40.02 --> 02:01:43.02 Yeah, we had a bug repellent for that.
02:01:43.02 --> 02:01:46.02 It's even really the bug repellent on them once you got sucked on by a leach.
02:01:46.02 --> 02:01:47.02 Yeah.
02:01:47.02 --> 02:01:48.02 They would instantly fall off.
02:01:48.02 --> 02:01:49.02 But you always try to wait.
02:01:49.02 --> 02:01:55.02 Try to just see if you could jiggle them off because you knew the bug repellent could be smelt.
02:01:55.02 --> 02:01:56.02 Hmm.
02:01:56.02 --> 02:01:57.02 By the bad guys.
02:01:57.02 --> 02:01:58.02 So.
02:01:58.02 --> 02:01:59.02 Hmm.
02:01:59.02 --> 02:02:04.02 Then you had your on your web gear, which was the old World War II web gear.
02:02:04.02 --> 02:02:05.02 You had on your left harness.
02:02:05.02 --> 02:02:06.02 You had your K bar.
02:02:06.02 --> 02:02:07.02 Handled down.
02:02:07.02 --> 02:02:08.02 Or a sock knife.
02:02:08.02 --> 02:02:10.02 Or a sock knife until you lost it.
02:02:10.02 --> 02:02:11.02 Tue love.
02:02:11.02 --> 02:02:14.02 That's what we need to do.
02:02:14.02 --> 02:02:17.02 A recovery mission for get the sock knife back.
02:02:17.02 --> 02:02:18.02 Yes.
02:02:18.02 --> 02:02:21.02 Handled down.
02:02:21.02 --> 02:02:22.02 Sure.
02:02:22.02 --> 02:02:23.02 That's how you rolled.
02:02:23.02 --> 02:02:25.02 Yeah, because this way you pulled out your ready.
02:02:25.02 --> 02:02:26.02 Hmm.
02:02:26.02 --> 02:02:29.02 It's a period to pull out the jungle. You might cut up in the vines.
02:02:29.02 --> 02:02:32.02 Got it. Got it.
02:02:32.02 --> 02:02:36.02 You had hand grenades there because you were basically covered in hand grenades.
02:02:36.02 --> 02:02:38.02 Oh yeah.
02:02:38.02 --> 02:02:39.02 Smoke.
02:02:39.02 --> 02:02:43.02 You had there. You had some some, you know, bandages there.
02:02:43.02 --> 02:02:45.02 On your right harness. You had your strobe light.
02:02:45.02 --> 02:02:47.02 You had more hand grenades.
02:02:47.02 --> 02:02:49.02 You had your D-ring.
02:02:49.02 --> 02:02:52.02 And you had more smoke grenades.
02:02:52.02 --> 02:02:54.02 Then on your belt.
02:02:54.02 --> 02:02:57.02 You had one canteen usually.
02:02:57.02 --> 02:03:01.02 It depends on the target. Sometimes it'd be maybe two.
02:03:01.02 --> 02:03:05.02 But usually one and then one I had a second one in my backpack.
02:03:05.02 --> 02:03:06.02 Rocksack.
02:03:06.02 --> 02:03:08.02 You normally wouldn't get, would you get thirsty?
02:03:08.02 --> 02:03:10.02 Was there normally enough water?
02:03:10.02 --> 02:03:13.02 Uh, and the jungle wasn't as bad as Cambodia.
02:03:13.02 --> 02:03:17.02 So, but yeah, you get thirsty because you're hopping up and down.
02:03:17.02 --> 02:03:20.02 Um, there's a couple times we particularly in that day.
02:03:20.02 --> 02:03:22.02 We went straight up with the orchards.
02:03:22.02 --> 02:03:25.02 That was a day we got, we were all out of water.
02:03:25.02 --> 02:03:27.02 Not fun.
02:03:27.02 --> 02:03:28.02 No.
02:03:28.02 --> 02:03:30.02 So you had one canteen. You had a Willie Pete grenade.
02:03:30.02 --> 02:03:32.02 We had your survival axe.
02:03:32.02 --> 02:03:36.02 Which was the Frankenwarren survival axe type two.
02:03:36.02 --> 02:03:37.02 Indeed.
02:03:37.02 --> 02:03:38.02 That's what I wanted.
02:03:38.02 --> 02:03:40.02 I wanted to type two.
02:03:40.02 --> 02:03:44.02 I looked him up and had like a hook at the top.
02:03:44.02 --> 02:03:45.02 Yeah.
02:03:45.02 --> 02:03:46.02 Another play you went through.
02:03:46.02 --> 02:03:48.02 When you came back on the, on the back pool,
02:03:48.02 --> 02:03:53.02 you could try to make it effective to cut a, particularly cutting vines.
02:03:53.02 --> 02:03:55.02 That thing came with you all the time.
02:03:55.02 --> 02:03:57.02 Every mission.
02:03:57.02 --> 02:03:59.02 I got a home under my desk right now.
02:03:59.02 --> 02:04:01.02 In case any true comes in, I'm ready.
02:04:01.02 --> 02:04:02.02 I like it.
02:04:02.02 --> 02:04:04.02 Ha ha ha ha.
02:04:04.02 --> 02:04:06.02 So if you're in true there's feeling lucky.
02:04:06.02 --> 02:04:07.02 Yeah, luck.
02:04:07.02 --> 02:04:09.02 Meet Mr. Till.
02:04:09.02 --> 02:04:11.02 I compass around your neck.
02:04:11.02 --> 02:04:14.02 You used to carve out for your belt.
02:04:14.02 --> 02:04:15.02 Yes.
02:04:15.02 --> 02:04:17.02 So the belt I was talking about before is that we're built of your web gear.
02:04:17.02 --> 02:04:20.02 But just the part of your pants was just a, was a cravat.
02:04:20.02 --> 02:04:22.02 You cared to swiss army knife.
02:04:22.02 --> 02:04:24.02 You cared a gas mask.
02:04:24.02 --> 02:04:25.02 Always.
02:04:25.02 --> 02:04:27.02 You always cared a gas mask.
02:04:27.02 --> 02:04:32.02 How we had teams that got hit and the A camps that have been hit by the enemy used to.
02:04:32.02 --> 02:04:33.02 Yes.
02:04:33.02 --> 02:04:34.02 Sure.
02:04:34.02 --> 02:04:35.02 And they used.
02:04:35.02 --> 02:04:42.02 I forget what the, the instance were, but there were a couple times that the enemy had used gas on our people in
02:04:42.02 --> 02:04:47.02 the US as well as with the CIA operation. We weren't told that.
02:04:47.02 --> 02:04:51.02 But we had cold evidence that they had done it.
02:04:51.02 --> 02:04:53.02 And that they could hit one of our recontinues.
02:04:53.02 --> 02:04:56.02 So we had to carry that bulky, yes thing at all times.
02:04:56.02 --> 02:05:01.02 I was going to say, but and this is this was the, the, the concern was tear gas.
02:05:01.02 --> 02:05:04.02 Well tear gas or who else knows what they had.
02:05:04.02 --> 02:05:05.02 I mean, these are common.
02:05:05.02 --> 02:05:07.02 It's done to play by rules of engagement.
02:05:07.02 --> 02:05:09.02 I mean, they're not in the lails.
02:05:09.02 --> 02:05:10.02 Because yeah, that's your opinion.
02:05:10.02 --> 02:05:12.02 I was thinking with all this crap that you're carrying.
02:05:12.02 --> 02:05:15.02 And a gas mask or just huge and bulky.
02:05:15.02 --> 02:05:17.02 Yeah, left hip.
02:05:17.02 --> 02:05:18.02 I don't know if that all the time.
02:05:18.02 --> 02:05:19.02 Had to.
02:05:19.02 --> 02:05:21.02 And we used them twice.
02:05:21.02 --> 02:05:25.02 And we, in fact, we had designed a mission.
02:05:25.02 --> 02:05:28.02 One of our missions was to.
02:05:28.02 --> 02:05:32.02 When we got a stractive from a target an M.A. target,
02:05:32.02 --> 02:05:35.02 we saw a road to had.
02:05:35.02 --> 02:05:39.02 A little guard station, a guard station.
02:05:39.02 --> 02:05:42.02 But it was north of the DMC river.
02:05:42.02 --> 02:05:45.02 So the quest for getting.
02:05:45.02 --> 02:05:47.02 A live POW.
02:05:47.02 --> 02:05:52.02 We found out that we had one of our guys that did a VR and flew a couple of rules.
02:05:52.02 --> 02:05:54.02 And they saw these little waste stations along the way.
02:05:54.02 --> 02:05:57.02 So our thought was, we'll get gas.
02:05:57.02 --> 02:05:58.02 Gas.
02:05:58.02 --> 02:06:01.02 And they said they had a knockout gas at the time, right?
02:06:01.02 --> 02:06:05.02 So we practiced for a couple of days with tear gas.
02:06:05.02 --> 02:06:08.02 And we had to get the helicopter piles and the gun crews.
02:06:08.02 --> 02:06:11.02 Everybody would their masks and then have masks that they could talk to each other.
02:06:11.02 --> 02:06:13.02 And then talk to us.
02:06:13.02 --> 02:06:18.02 And so we practiced for several days training with the helicopters coming in.
02:06:18.02 --> 02:06:21.02 And the mission plan was go up.
02:06:21.02 --> 02:06:23.02 In the middle of the day.
02:06:23.02 --> 02:06:24.02 Go to one of those camps.
02:06:24.02 --> 02:06:25.02 Hit it.
02:06:25.02 --> 02:06:26.02 Gas it.
02:06:26.02 --> 02:06:27.02 Go in and scarf.
02:06:27.02 --> 02:06:28.02 And go home.
02:06:28.02 --> 02:06:29.02 Get a five day pass.
02:06:29.02 --> 02:06:30.02 100 bucks.
02:06:30.02 --> 02:06:31.02 Yeah.
02:06:31.02 --> 02:06:34.02 But they had a special knockout gas that was supposed to use.
02:06:34.02 --> 02:06:36.02 And at the end they wouldn't let us.
02:06:36.02 --> 02:06:38.02 They wouldn't give us the gas.
02:06:38.02 --> 02:06:39.02 I don't know if they had it.
02:06:39.02 --> 02:06:42.02 But they wouldn't give us the knockout gas.
02:06:42.02 --> 02:06:44.02 So another mission came up.
02:06:44.02 --> 02:06:48.02 We had a bright light around and we never got back to the concept of doing it.
02:06:48.02 --> 02:06:49.02 And you carried.
02:06:49.02 --> 02:06:52.02 You usually carried one grenade for your 40 mic mic.
02:06:52.02 --> 02:06:53.02 That was tear gas.
02:06:53.02 --> 02:06:54.02 Always.
02:06:54.02 --> 02:06:55.02 Sure.
02:06:55.02 --> 02:06:56.02 Kiss me needed it.
02:06:56.02 --> 02:06:59.02 And that was what would your what would your tactic be on using that?
02:06:59.02 --> 02:07:02.02 And usually it would be to.
02:07:02.02 --> 02:07:05.02 You know, to create this order.
02:07:05.02 --> 02:07:07.02 Because he hit somebody with tear gas.
02:07:07.02 --> 02:07:09.02 If it's far away.
02:07:09.02 --> 02:07:12.02 That would distract him for a second.
02:07:12.02 --> 02:07:13.02 Take their mind off a business.
02:07:13.02 --> 02:07:16.02 Or at least make them have a hard time to kill us.
02:07:16.02 --> 02:07:20.02 And we also carried a grass a gas grenade local.
02:07:20.02 --> 02:07:21.02 Okay.
02:07:21.02 --> 02:07:23.02 So we had in our SOP.
02:07:23.02 --> 02:07:26.02 A procedure that the word or I figured that was.
02:07:26.02 --> 02:07:30.02 But we had a signal or a sign for CS gas.
02:07:30.02 --> 02:07:37.02 So if we're getting so overrun to where the pop of CS to break the charg with some of our teams did.
02:07:37.02 --> 02:07:42.02 They used it in an operation tailwind quite effectively saved your bacon.
02:07:42.02 --> 02:07:45.02 So the idea would be hey, this is going to.
02:07:45.02 --> 02:07:48.02 Linger whereas a frag grenade goes off.
02:07:48.02 --> 02:07:49.02 You either wound guys or you don't.
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:50.02 You either kill guys or you don't.
02:07:50.02 --> 02:07:51.02 But that's it.
02:07:51.02 --> 02:07:52.02 It's over.
02:07:52.02 --> 02:07:52.02 Yeah.
02:07:52.02 --> 02:07:53.02 Whereas gas.
02:07:53.02 --> 02:07:57.02 You can really disrupt them because now you got guys coughing and you can.
02:07:57.02 --> 02:07:58.02 Yeah.
02:07:58.02 --> 02:07:59.02 Puking and whatever.
02:07:59.02 --> 02:08:02.02 And it's and it hangs to the ground and then it hangs around as long as the wind's.
02:08:02.02 --> 02:08:04.02 It's going to let it hang around.
02:08:04.02 --> 02:08:05.02 Got it.
02:08:05.02 --> 02:08:07.02 Left pant pocket.
02:08:07.02 --> 02:08:09.02 You had a marking panel large and small.
02:08:09.02 --> 02:08:11.02 Right pant pocket.
02:08:11.02 --> 02:08:12.02 Pen flares.
02:08:12.02 --> 02:08:15.02 Dehydrated lyrp ration.
02:08:15.02 --> 02:08:17.02 Bug repellent for leeches.
02:08:17.02 --> 02:08:18.02 An extra covat.
02:08:18.02 --> 02:08:19.02 An extra bandage.
02:08:19.02 --> 02:08:21.02 Did anybody carry IV?
02:08:21.02 --> 02:08:24.02 A silver or a guy's did.
02:08:24.02 --> 02:08:25.02 Okay.
02:08:25.02 --> 02:08:27.02 Lim black did and.
02:08:27.02 --> 02:08:29.02 We had.
02:08:29.02 --> 02:08:34.02 I think South carry one of our in ditch carry one we had an IV and the.
02:08:34.02 --> 02:08:37.02 St.line solution that came in a canister.
02:08:37.02 --> 02:08:39.02 So it always had one in case we needed.
02:08:39.02 --> 02:08:40.02 Mm-hmm.
02:08:40.02 --> 02:08:42.02 In your rock sack.
02:08:42.02 --> 02:08:45.02 You got your you got your PRC 25.
02:08:45.02 --> 02:08:47.02 Which you guys called the prick 25.
02:08:47.02 --> 02:08:48.02 Yeah.
02:08:48.02 --> 02:08:50.02 I think I was I think I was outlawed from calling it a prick.
02:08:50.02 --> 02:08:52.02 That that PRC 25.
02:08:52.02 --> 02:08:57.02 So the PRC 25 was replaced by the PR77 the.
02:08:57.02 --> 02:09:02.02 Pro 77 and I was let us say it was 1969 or something like that when I got the
02:09:02.02 --> 02:09:06.02 Seal team one that's what I used was a few is one of the radios that we had in our story
02:09:06.02 --> 02:09:07.02 It was a PRC 7.
02:09:07.02 --> 02:09:08.02 Yeah.
02:09:08.02 --> 02:09:10.02 Which came directly from the PRC 25.
02:09:10.02 --> 02:09:14.02 So you'd carry that you had the big whip antenna but you wouldn't you have the little
02:09:14.02 --> 02:09:18.02 tape antenna on there so you don't right identified as the radio guy because otherwise you could
02:09:18.02 --> 02:09:21.02 it.
02:09:21.02 --> 02:09:22.02 Yeah.
02:09:22.02 --> 02:09:23.02 Yeah.
02:09:23.02 --> 02:09:25.02 Because you just hold it over.
02:09:25.02 --> 02:09:28.02 And in our case the antenna we just get it and bend it down.
02:09:28.02 --> 02:09:31.02 Come and eat your arm and stick it into the fatigue.
02:09:31.02 --> 02:09:33.02 So be low profile on it.
02:09:33.02 --> 02:09:35.02 Then you had your your one C rat of fruit.
02:09:35.02 --> 02:09:39.02 That was like your that was your your go to indeed.
02:09:39.02 --> 02:09:41.02 And you carry one of those two with us.
02:09:41.02 --> 02:09:42.02 I'm like that.
02:09:42.02 --> 02:09:47.02 You just one could after while you know we kept getting shot out so often.
02:09:47.02 --> 02:09:50.02 It's like okay I'm not too much weight.
02:09:50.02 --> 02:09:51.02 Yeah.
02:09:51.02 --> 02:09:52.02 Yeah.
02:09:52.02 --> 02:09:53.02 Yeah.
02:09:53.02 --> 02:09:57.02 You had your extra mags and there you got an extra M79 rounds.
02:09:57.02 --> 02:10:00.02 You had your army long sleeve sweater.
02:10:00.02 --> 02:10:02.02 You had a plastic rain jacket.
02:10:02.02 --> 02:10:05.02 Toilet paper even though you apparently never used it.
02:10:05.02 --> 02:10:06.02 Correct.
02:10:06.02 --> 02:10:08.02 But you've also used it the pack wounds.
02:10:08.02 --> 02:10:09.02 There you go.
02:10:09.02 --> 02:10:11.02 Extra battery.
02:10:11.02 --> 02:10:16.02 For the for the prick 25 and the URC 10.
02:10:16.02 --> 02:10:19.02 Extra smoke grenades.
02:10:19.02 --> 02:10:21.02 Extra cantina water.
02:10:21.02 --> 02:10:22.02 Extra ration.
02:10:22.02 --> 02:10:28.02 And then you had your clay more or clay more with five and ten second fuses.
02:10:28.02 --> 02:10:33.02 And on top of that that's 22 caliber hush puppy on some operations sometimes.
02:10:33.02 --> 02:10:34.02 Yeah.
02:10:34.02 --> 02:10:37.02 And all this when you'd weighed yourself you'd be about 90 pounds heavy.
02:10:37.02 --> 02:10:38.02 Right around there.
02:10:38.02 --> 02:10:39.02 Yeah.
02:10:39.02 --> 02:10:41.02 And it was it was an old Rick the S scale.
02:10:41.02 --> 02:10:44.02 So I just jumped on it carrying everything just to see what it was.
02:10:44.02 --> 02:10:46.02 Well that's a heavy load out.
02:10:46.02 --> 02:10:48.02 I'll tell you right now that's a heavy load out.
02:10:48.02 --> 02:10:51.02 That is absolutely all of 90 pounds.
02:10:51.02 --> 02:10:53.02 When you start talking about 600 rounds of ammunition.
02:10:53.02 --> 02:10:59.02 We start talking about 10 to 12 hand grenades smoke smoke grenades are heavy as hell.
02:10:59.02 --> 02:11:01.02 They got all that material in them.
02:11:01.02 --> 02:11:02.02 That's folks.
02:11:02.02 --> 02:11:03.02 Yeah.
02:11:03.02 --> 02:11:04.02 They're big giant beasts.
02:11:04.02 --> 02:11:05.02 And the Willie Peters.
02:11:05.02 --> 02:11:06.02 The Willie Peters.
02:11:06.02 --> 02:11:07.02 Have you do?
02:11:07.02 --> 02:11:09.02 Uh.
02:11:09.02 --> 02:11:12.02 Crazy mouth.
02:11:12.02 --> 02:11:13.02 Um.
02:11:13.02 --> 02:11:18.02 And I guess like I said and like you said you're carrying all that firepower.
02:11:18.02 --> 02:11:23.02 Because the operations you're carrying a crazy amount of firepower because you're doing crazy operations.
02:11:23.02 --> 02:11:24.02 Yeah.
02:11:24.02 --> 02:11:26.02 And again, I'm talking to the other ones.
02:11:26.02 --> 02:11:28.02 You're a Pat Walkins and Montgomery.
02:11:28.02 --> 02:11:30.02 Because initially I don't know what the loads were.
02:11:30.02 --> 02:11:32.02 But they kept increasing.
02:11:32.02 --> 02:11:35.02 And because there was shovel time and they ran out of ammo.
02:11:35.02 --> 02:11:37.02 Already got close to running out.
02:11:37.02 --> 02:11:39.02 And that's the last thing in the world you want.
02:11:39.02 --> 02:11:40.02 You know.
02:11:40.02 --> 02:11:41.02 Yeah.
02:11:41.02 --> 02:11:44.02 Awesome.
02:11:44.02 --> 02:11:49.02 Well, you know, that's a little over two hours right now.
02:11:49.02 --> 02:11:51.02 And it's been a quick night.
02:11:51.02 --> 02:11:52.02 Yeah.
02:11:52.02 --> 02:11:53.02 Indeed.
02:11:53.02 --> 02:11:58.02 But you got any closing thoughts?
02:11:58.02 --> 02:11:59.02 No.
02:11:59.02 --> 02:12:03.02 Just to thank you for having me in three times.
02:12:03.02 --> 02:12:05.02 We've gained some extra depth.
02:12:05.02 --> 02:12:10.02 Like I said before, we were just chatting and said these stories always felt worse
02:12:10.02 --> 02:12:16.02 and more significant in terms of the stories about what Sog did in the men, more importantly men.
02:12:16.02 --> 02:12:20.02 And also like I said to you earlier, my stuff is hairy.
02:12:20.02 --> 02:12:28.02 But if you had a hairy scale on one to ten, I mean, I feel I put myself at a five or six compared to the guys.
02:12:28.02 --> 02:12:34.02 I got the metal boner to guys that didn't come home that went down fighting, getting over run by the NBA.
02:12:34.02 --> 02:12:39.02 And we could just talk about metal boner missions of guys standing there just fighting.
02:12:39.02 --> 02:12:45.02 And they're just fighting off and dying on the LZ, putting their people on the helicopter first.
02:12:45.02 --> 02:12:54.02 John Caddenberg, Johnny Gallon, time and again, RSF guys would take care of the little people we even get them on the chopper, get them out.
02:12:54.02 --> 02:12:58.02 And so those stories I felt was great valor.
02:12:58.02 --> 02:13:02.02 And so I thank you for the little extra pleasure to your audience.
02:13:02.02 --> 02:13:03.02 Well, we appreciate that.
02:13:03.02 --> 02:13:08.02 We'll bring you back on and we'll get, and I know you and I are talking about
02:13:08.02 --> 02:13:15.02 other guys that we're going to come on and all those stories of those heroes will we'll get them out there because
02:13:15.02 --> 02:13:18.02 People want to know I want to hear them.
02:13:18.02 --> 02:13:24.02 I want to know as much as I can about them and and and you know, we'll get you back.
02:13:24.02 --> 02:13:25.02 I'm ready to roll.
02:13:25.02 --> 02:13:30.02 So thank you and I thank you for the time and also you're on a, you're like Mr. social media now.
02:13:30.02 --> 02:13:31.02 I didn't realize that.
02:13:31.02 --> 02:13:33.02 You got to give me a full briefing where it's done.
02:13:33.02 --> 02:13:35.02 So you're on Twitter.

02:13:39.02 --> 02:13:41.02 We haven't quite figured out Twitter yet.
02:13:41.02 --> 02:13:43.02 Apparently you're, and makes two of us.
02:13:43.02 --> 02:13:48.02 Your old, your old Twitter handle was at Saga Chronicles.

02:14:18.02 --> 02:14:19.02 Everybody has a platform.
02:14:19.02 --> 02:14:20.02 It's incredibly good.
02:14:20.02 --> 02:14:24.02 Sometimes it's incredibly bad, but everybody has a platform.
02:14:24.02 --> 02:14:28.02 So no, the cool thing about it is people have been, you know,
02:14:28.02 --> 02:14:32.02 talking to me and hitting me up and just thanking you for your service.
02:14:32.02 --> 02:14:33.02 Thank you for coming on.
02:14:33.02 --> 02:14:35.02 Thank you for sharing the story.
02:14:35.02 --> 02:14:37.02 So it'll be cool that they'll be able to actually thank you.
02:14:37.02 --> 02:14:38.02 Instead of just telling me to tell you things.
02:14:38.02 --> 02:14:39.02 I just go to our website.
02:14:39.02 --> 02:14:42.02 They got the link in there for email for the old fast and root.
02:14:42.02 --> 02:14:43.02 Saga Chronicles.com.
02:14:43.02 --> 02:14:44.02 Saga Chronicles.com.
02:14:44.02 --> 02:14:45.02 Have one.
02:14:45.02 --> 02:14:46.02 Yeah, people on there.
02:14:46.02 --> 02:14:49.02 I wanted to close out reading one last thing.
02:14:49.02 --> 02:14:52.02 And this is your, your dedication for the book,
02:14:52.02 --> 02:14:53.02 Saga Chronicles.
02:14:53.02 --> 02:14:54.02 One.
02:14:54.02 --> 02:14:57.02 And it said it says this book is dedicated to the
02:14:57.02 --> 02:15:01.02 Saga Men and their courageous indigenous team members who went across the fence and the
02:15:01.02 --> 02:15:06.02 Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam during the eight year secret war.
02:15:06.02 --> 02:15:09.02 And to the end to the brave aviators and crew members of the army,
02:15:09.02 --> 02:15:13.02 Air Force Marine Corps and our fearless allies from the
02:15:13.02 --> 02:15:17.02 219th South Vietnamese Air Force's special operation squadron,
02:15:17.02 --> 02:15:21.02 Blegendary Kingbees who supported, who supported,
02:15:21.02 --> 02:15:24.02 Saga teams on the ground.
02:15:24.02 --> 02:15:30.02 This book is also for every man in Saga and the aviators who made the ultimate sacrifice
02:15:30.02 --> 02:15:39.02 far outside the boundaries of conventional Vietnam war that America saw reported on the nightly news.
02:15:39.02 --> 02:15:41.02 I'll give the closing note.
02:15:41.02 --> 02:15:49.02 Today, 1,598 Americans that are MIA and South these days are from the Vietnam war.
02:15:49.02 --> 02:15:57.02 50 green berets alone in Laos are still MIA, including 140 plus aviators that died
02:15:57.02 --> 02:15:59.02 strictly supporting our mission.
02:15:59.02 --> 02:16:05.02 And this week, the National League of POWMIA found is having a 50th annual meeting in
02:16:05.02 --> 02:16:08.02 Arlington on this topic.
02:16:08.02 --> 02:16:13.02 They've been diligent and the M. Mills Griffiths is the CEO.
02:16:13.02 --> 02:16:14.02 She's putting it all together.
02:16:14.02 --> 02:16:16.02 They work with the Pentagon.
02:16:16.02 --> 02:16:18.02 She'd been on this mission for day one.
02:16:18.02 --> 02:16:23.02 And our prayers are with them to continue because they're pushing to bring our people home.
02:16:23.02 --> 02:16:24.02 Absolutely.
02:16:24.02 --> 02:16:30.02 And if you want to put that out either on Saga Chronicles, put a link to how people can support that cause.
02:16:30.02 --> 02:16:33.02 People will absolutely support that cause.
02:16:33.02 --> 02:16:34.02 Okay.
02:16:34.02 --> 02:16:35.02 We'll do that.
02:16:35.02 --> 02:16:36.02 Absolutely.
02:16:36.02 --> 02:16:36.02 They deserve it.
02:16:36.02 --> 02:16:37.02 Yes, absolutely.
02:16:37.02 --> 02:16:38.02 We can make that happen.
02:16:38.02 --> 02:16:39.02 Wow.
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:39.02 Thank you.
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:40.02 Airborne.
02:16:40.02 --> 02:16:43.02 All right. Well, like I said, you haven't opened in invite on here.
02:16:43.02 --> 02:16:45.02 Anytime you want, you let us know.
02:16:45.02 --> 02:16:48.02 We're here. And we'll get some of your friends on.
02:16:48.02 --> 02:16:50.02 And thanks for coming on yourself.
02:16:50.02 --> 02:16:53.02 Thanks for sharing your stories and most of all.
02:16:53.02 --> 02:16:54.02 More than anything else.
02:16:54.02 --> 02:16:56.02 Thanks for your service and sacrifice.
02:16:56.02 --> 02:16:57.02 Likewise, brother, you've been there.
02:16:57.02 --> 02:16:58.02 You've seen the elephant.
02:16:58.02 --> 02:17:01.02 Appreciate it.
02:17:01.02 --> 02:17:07.02 And once again, John Stryker Meyer has left the building.
02:17:07.02 --> 02:17:08.02 Tilt.
02:17:08.02 --> 02:17:09.02 Tilt.
02:17:09.02 --> 02:17:11.02 Has left the building.
02:17:11.02 --> 02:17:18.02 Finishing up three podcasts with John Stryker Meyer.
02:17:18.02 --> 02:17:19.02 Yeah.
02:17:19.02 --> 02:17:21.02 Sappers.
02:17:21.02 --> 02:17:22.02 Sappers.
02:17:22.02 --> 02:17:24.02 I asked him what Sappers was.
02:17:24.02 --> 02:17:25.02 Workers.
02:17:25.02 --> 02:17:27.02 There's various references.
02:17:27.02 --> 02:17:30.02 First, second, and this past one to Sappers.
02:17:30.02 --> 02:17:36.02 And more notably, one, if you remember, then we'd be preded to the first one.
02:17:36.02 --> 02:17:39.02 He says, Sappers, still Sappers been on a sense.
02:17:39.02 --> 02:17:41.02 I love all of all, whatever that's interesting.
02:17:41.02 --> 02:17:44.02 And I always wondered, what's a Sapper?
02:17:44.02 --> 02:17:51.02 Special group, Vietnam, North Vietnamese group of anti-American fighters.
02:17:51.02 --> 02:17:54.02 Train specifically, right?
02:17:54.02 --> 02:17:55.02 Right?
02:17:55.02 --> 02:17:56.02 I got that right.
02:17:56.02 --> 02:17:57.02 Did I remember that correctly?
02:17:57.02 --> 02:18:02.02 Yeah, that's the definition that John Stryker Meyer just gave you.
02:18:02.02 --> 02:18:03.02 Yeah.
02:18:03.02 --> 02:18:05.02 All right.
02:18:05.02 --> 02:18:06.02 Cool.
02:18:06.02 --> 02:18:07.02 What else?
02:18:07.02 --> 02:18:11.02 Well, I would say, no, awesome.
02:18:11.02 --> 02:18:15.02 Awesome to have John Stryker Meyer on here.
02:18:15.02 --> 02:18:24.02 And just to hear him talk about what human beings can do.
02:18:24.02 --> 02:18:25.02 Right?
02:18:25.02 --> 02:18:28.02 What people, human beings, can do.
02:18:28.02 --> 02:18:31.02 And it's interesting, because you ever look at dogs and you think, oh, there's a little
02:18:31.02 --> 02:18:32.02 tiny chihuahua.
02:18:32.02 --> 02:18:35.02 And then there's like a German Shepherd.
02:18:35.02 --> 02:18:36.02 Yeah.
02:18:36.02 --> 02:18:38.02 And you think those are the same animal?
02:18:38.02 --> 02:18:39.02 Right?
02:18:39.02 --> 02:18:40.02 Yes.
02:18:40.02 --> 02:18:41.02 They are.
02:18:41.02 --> 02:18:42.02 Technically.
02:18:42.02 --> 02:18:43.02 Yeah.
02:18:43.02 --> 02:18:44.02 Human beings.
02:18:44.02 --> 02:18:45.02 Think, you know.
02:18:45.02 --> 02:18:47.02 Like you look at John Stryker Meyer.
02:18:47.02 --> 02:18:49.02 He's like a German Shepherd.
02:18:49.02 --> 02:18:50.02 Yeah.
02:18:50.02 --> 02:18:52.02 And then you got people running around their chihuahua.
02:18:52.02 --> 02:18:55.02 No, it depends against the chihuahua, but your chihuahua is not going to...
02:18:55.02 --> 02:18:56.02 Yes.
02:18:56.02 --> 02:18:57.02 Fend off hordes.
02:18:57.02 --> 02:18:58.02 No.
02:18:58.02 --> 02:18:59.02 No.
02:18:59.02 --> 02:19:01.02 Chihuahua is not calling an Airstrikes danger close.
02:19:01.02 --> 02:19:02.02 No.
02:19:02.02 --> 02:19:06.02 I guess my point is that human beings do have capabilities.
02:19:06.02 --> 02:19:15.02 And I think that when you listen to tilt, you realize that I can probably do better.
02:19:15.02 --> 02:19:17.02 I know that's what I realize.
02:19:17.02 --> 02:19:20.02 I think I can do better than I'm doing right now.
02:19:20.02 --> 02:19:21.02 Yeah.
02:19:21.02 --> 02:19:24.02 I think I can push the envelope a little bit.
02:19:24.02 --> 02:19:27.02 Yeah.
02:19:27.02 --> 02:19:31.02 Move further toward the potential.
02:19:31.02 --> 02:19:38.02 The part that kind of, well, probably will stick with me is how he didn't carry
02:19:38.02 --> 02:19:40.02 Panture, like the sleepings, no comps.
02:19:40.02 --> 02:19:41.02 No comps.
02:19:41.02 --> 02:19:42.02 No comps.
02:19:42.02 --> 02:19:45.02 If we have to go sleep, I'm just going to sleep right here in the kitchen.
02:19:45.02 --> 02:19:46.02 Yeah.
02:19:46.02 --> 02:19:47.02 In the kitchen.
02:19:47.02 --> 02:19:48.02 On the aunt hill.
02:19:48.02 --> 02:19:49.02 Yeah.
02:19:49.02 --> 02:19:51.02 That part.
02:19:51.02 --> 02:19:56.02 When I was a kid, I was a kid.
02:19:56.02 --> 02:19:59.02 But now you need comfort.
02:19:59.02 --> 02:20:01.02 Yeah.
02:20:01.02 --> 02:20:05.02 So that part, maybe I have to mentally, maybe work on that.
02:20:05.02 --> 02:20:06.02 All right.
02:20:06.02 --> 02:20:07.02 It's facing it.
02:20:07.02 --> 02:20:09.02 There are ways to get better.
02:20:09.02 --> 02:20:10.02 Yes or there is.
02:20:10.02 --> 02:20:13.02 Maybe sleeping without a ground pad is one of them.
02:20:13.02 --> 02:20:14.02 Yeah.
02:20:14.02 --> 02:20:16.02 Maybe another one is train, Gigiatu.
02:20:16.02 --> 02:20:17.02 Oh yeah.
02:20:17.02 --> 02:20:18.02 Big time.
02:20:18.02 --> 02:20:23.02 That's a, I mean, so I was training the other day with Noah Oliver, right?
02:20:23.02 --> 02:20:28.02 And Noah's been training and he's kind of sorting out, you know how you go in phases of training partners.
02:20:28.02 --> 02:20:29.02 You know how you go.
02:20:29.02 --> 02:20:33.02 But I've been training with Andy for like the last like three months, you know, more than it.
02:20:33.02 --> 02:20:38.02 So man, but he's been like beat me down the other day yesterday.
02:20:38.02 --> 02:20:39.02 Yes or whatever.
02:20:39.02 --> 02:20:42.02 And yeah, he beat me down.
02:20:42.02 --> 02:20:48.02 But at the same time, I didn't leave thinking like, oh my gosh, you're just socks.
02:20:48.02 --> 02:20:53.02 You know, when you get beat down, you think of, okay, what do I need to do to that's the correct data?
02:20:53.02 --> 02:20:54.02 Yeah.
02:20:54.02 --> 02:20:58.000 Well, especially when you have training partners that you like and you trust and you, you know, you
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.000 enjoy what you get from the training where every garnish you got beat down or not.
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000 I think your mind ought to, well, start automatically go to that.
02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:11.000 I think most of the time it's usually when, I don't know, it's other circumstances then you'll be all salty.
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000 Make excuses or something like that.
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:19.000 Either way, so I'm thinking, you know, of all the things and then I arrive at the concept of man,
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:25.000 in any other situation, you take that kind of like just physical turmoil.
02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000 That only did get beat, but it was that kind of heart, you know.
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.000 Usually I don't feel this good about it.
02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000 I'm not looking forward to the next time, you know, like, come on, let's face it.
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000 You do a hard and met con, you're like boom, I'm glad that's over with it.
02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000 But in this case, you are looking forward to the next one.
02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:46.000 Yeah, you're looking forward to the next one, you're looking forward to just training more in general.
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:50.000 There's a short term and long term pay off for this.
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000 Judzitsuit thing.
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000 Interesting.
02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000 Oh yeah.
02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000 Very true.
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000 I've got to mention the capability that you wind up with.
02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000 So we're pro-Juget series, what we're dedicated to.
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.000 We are 100,000 percent short term and long term.
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000 There's no, there's no dichotomy.
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000 There's just short term gain, long term gain.
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000 Yes, in my opinion.
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.000 But it could be argued that, oh, it's hard.
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000 What about the days?
02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000 What about sometimes when people don't want to train?
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000 They let the jigset to window close.
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000 Like, we confirmed is a thing.
02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000 It is a thing, but that's, you know what I kind of arrived at as well.
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:26.000 The days that you actually don't want to train are way more rare than you might think.
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000 Like, if you ever said, man, I really don't feel like training.
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:33.000 And then you make the drive to the gym, you get to the gym, you train in part and you show up.
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000 You write when you go to shake hands and you still feel like,
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000 Oh, I really don't want to train in our business.
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000 Do you have those?
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000 Never have.
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000 Never, right?
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000 Hardly ever.
02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000 I can't think of one single time.
02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000 I thought I came to the gym one time and I got there.
02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:50.000 And I was like, I still don't want to train, but it was because there was only like,
02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000 three people there and they were like really brand new at the time.
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.000 And then I was like, and I just went home one time and my whole life.
02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:01.000 But I did, I legitimately did not feel like training anyway.
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000 Legitement.
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000 Usually, if you don't feel like training, it's not that you don't feel like training.
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000 It's not that you don't feel like training.
02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:17.000 It's, you don't feel like getting off the couch, getting into your car, getting your gear, getting,
02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000 doing that.
02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000 That's what you don't feel like doing.
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000 Oh, you feel like training because when it's time to train, it's good fun.
02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000 Every single time.
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000 That's what I think.
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000 It's a weird aspect that GG2 is fun.
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000 It's fun.
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000 Yeah.
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:38.000 I have a feeling sometimes when I train GG2 where I'm literally like kind of beside myself with how
02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000 fun that just.
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000 Oh, yeah.
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000 Yeah.
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.000 And that's sometimes I'm getting beat down and I'm thinking that sometimes I'm winning
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000 something.
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:55.000 But either way, I'm like, that was it's kind of like a feeling that's very hard to to describe.
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.000 Even.
02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000 Yeah.
02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.000 I would agree with that.
02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000 Yeah.
02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000 Because you have that obviously the physical part of it.
02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:02.000 Right.
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000 Yeah.
02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000 Yeah.
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.000 That's always good.
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000 You know that.
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000 But this is like, it's like, especially if you roll with like guys who are like, good.
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000 They're not good because they're so athletic, even though they might be athletic.
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000 They're good because they know what to do.
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000 Like a Dean, Mr. like Greg McIntyre.
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000 These guys who like Greg.
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000 Greg, Greg.
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:25.000 Greg, Greg, if you don't think you're way into or out of your situation you want, man, you're
02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000 you're just not going to do it.
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:32.000 You know, so it's that problem solving task that's just intertwined in the whole thing.
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000 I think that's what makes it fun.
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000 That's what I think.
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000 Agreed.
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000 Anyway, GG, no GG streets, whatever.
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000 If you want to do GG, you're going to need a GG.
02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000 You get a GG from origin, origin made up of us.
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000 We can get the GG very selections on there.
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000 The best.
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000 Made in America, by the way.
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000 Made in America.
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:52.000 Yeah.
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000 And just kind of massive shipment of cotton.
02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000 I'm talking not talking woven.
02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000 I'm talking unwoven little strands of cotton.
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000 Check out the Instagram.
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000 There's palettes and palettes that are there.
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.000 And it's just, you think, okay, this cotton is going to get woven.
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000 And then turned into geese that I'm going to wear.
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000 What does cotton look like when it comes to palettes?
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.000 Because we want to use this little spools of, and it's not even, it's not just cotton,
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000 by the way, it's a blended material.
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000 So it's like, modern.
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000 Yeah.
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000 It's like a spool, but it's thick, a little bit thicker.
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000 Good.
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000 And that all gets woven together.
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000 We used to grow cotton when I was young.
02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000 And the yard.
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.000 I'm quite.
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000 Really.
02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000 For what purpose?
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000 Just, that's just how I guess.
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000 I don't know.
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000 Did you do something with?
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000 I don't know.
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000 Random.
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.000 It was a row of cotton trees.
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.000 So cotton is like a, it's like almost like a pod that turns inside out like a popcorn almost.
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000 Yeah.
02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000 If I remember correctly.
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000 And so that cotton would be balls of cotton.
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000 You know, like you get, you know, when you buy cotton balls?
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000 Yeah.
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000 Or, I'm sure you always buy cotton balls.
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000 But when you buy cotton balls, they're in balls.
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000 They're kind of like that, but more like there's not, they're not in a ball.
02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000 They're in a big clump.
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000 Okay.
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000 But there's seeds all in there.
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.000 You got to pick out the seeds and the seeds are all stuck to the cotton.
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000 I thought that's how they came.
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000 But they're, they're twined in order.
02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000 Yes.
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000 Spongebob.
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000 Yeah.
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000 Into string.
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000 All right.
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000 So we got cotton.
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000 We got geese.
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000 We got jeans.
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.000 Also.
02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000 I got jeans.
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:27.000 By the way.
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.000 Oh, so you're in the game now.
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000 I am totally in the game.
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000 And I'm surprised how good, how good.
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000 Okay.
02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.000 Good.
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:33.000 American denim.
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.000 Sure.
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.000 The buttons.
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000 Brass.
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000 When I see them, sure, I'm impressed.
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.000 But I'm, maybe I'm more surprised on top of the impress of how they fit.
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000 Next level.
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.000 I thought they were going to be like the kind of older, just generic feeding worker jeans.
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000 Which is fine.
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000 I get it.
02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.000 But that's not really what I was like deep down hoping for.
02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000 I was hoping for the kind that, you know, I can put on.
02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000 I can wear to, you know, if I go somewhere special with my life or something like that.
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000 Use putting on those origin jeans.
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000 No.
02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000 You can't.
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000 Yes. They're very good. They fit good.
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000 Hand it to Pete.
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000 Yeah.
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000 That stylish fashion dude.
02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000 They even fit a bit.
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.000 They even fit skinny knees.
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000 All right.
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000 T-shirts.
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:17.000 Jeans.
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000 Gies.
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000 Rascar's joggers.
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000 Supplements.
02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000 Yes.
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:22.000 Supplements.
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000 Get your joint warfare.
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:27.000 Get your krill oil.
02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000 Get your discipline.
02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000 Get your discipline.
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000 Go.
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000 Get these things.
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000 They will.
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000 They will make your life better.
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000 That's crazy.
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000 That sounds.
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000 They will make your life better as will.
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000 Mulk.
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000 Yes.
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000 And some people say what is mulk.
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000 And the answer is very clear.
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000 Mulk is.
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000 Mulk is mulk.
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000 That's right.
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000 Mulk is mulk.
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000 You can't just call it something.
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000 You can't call.
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000 You can't call a knife by some other name.
02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000 Right.
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:58.000 Right.
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000 It's a knife.
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000 Yeah.
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000 So you can't call mulk.
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000 You can't say mulk is something else.
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000 No.
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000 Mulk is mulk.
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000 Then again I'm in heaven.
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000 Don't fall that.
02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000 You can't call the knife a chunk.
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.000 Okay.
02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000 A blade.
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000 Yeah.
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000 You're right.
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000 Cold steel.
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000 There's a lot of words for a knife.
02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000 So there's other words for mulk.
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000 That is where you're saying.
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000 No.
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.000 I'm not saying that.
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000 Just say mulk is mulk.
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000 Yes.
02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000 It is a dessert in the shape of a protein powder.
02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000 That's healthy.
02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.000 Okay.
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.000 So you can either call that or you can call a mulk.
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000 It tastes like dessert.
02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000 And yet it's good for you and gives you protein.
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000 Strawberry is delicious.
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000 Mint chocolate chip.
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000 I had so much strawberry.
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000 I had to go back to mint and I was like,
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000 Good.
02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000 It's crazy.
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000 Mint is delicious.
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000 What do you want?
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000 Mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake or do you want to mint mulk?
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000 Oh, I'll take the mint mulk all day long.
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000 Oh yeah.
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000 Short and long term bail.
02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000 Short and long term bail off.
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000 Peanut butter, Reese's cup.
02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000 I don't know if you're allowed to say Reese's cup,
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000 but that's basically what you're saying.
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000 Peanut butter Reese's cup, but it's peanut butter
02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000 and chocolate mulk tasty.
02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000 What am I missing?
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000 Vanilla.
02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000 I'm not a vanilla guy.
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000 I don't like the vanilla yogurt.
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000 I don't like vanilla.
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000 Vanilla.
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.000 Vanilla mulk is.
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000 It's if you like vanilla, you're good.
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000 Right.
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000 If you don't like vanilla, you don't don't get it.
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000 There's a whole hoard of vanilla like this.
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000 Yeah, for sure.
02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:25.000 But the thing that's cool about vanilla,
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000 I guess is that you can do other things with it.
02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000 Yeah.
02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000 Jason Gardner put it in your morning coffee.
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000 Head it with the, he likes to say,
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:35.000 hit it with the blender stick.
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000 Right?
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000 You know, people some people like to say things.
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000 Yes, they do.
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000 He's like, I hate it.
02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000 He gets all fired up through.
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000 I hate it with that blender stick.
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000 He calls it a blender stick.
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000 So they're Jason Gardner.
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000 So in Jason Gardner's,
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.000 he's a great shape getting after it.
02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000 So maybe it maybe is a positive thing.
02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000 And no forget that there's a warrior kid moke.
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000 Because do you want to feed your child poison?
02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000 No.
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000 Do you?
02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000 I do not.
02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000 Okay.
02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000 Cool.
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000 Then you get a moke.
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000 Do you want your kid to be miserable when they eat
02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000 because what you're feeding them tastes disgusting?
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.000 Let me think.
02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000 No.
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.000 Okay.
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.000 Cool.
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000 So you give a moke.
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000 And you're being healthy.
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000 And you're taking care of your kid.
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.000 And you're actually being a good parent.
02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000 Oh yeah.
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000 Otherwise you're neglecting your child's welfare.
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000 Don't do it.
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000 Yeah.
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:31.000 Moke, strawberry moke, chocolate moke gets on.
02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:32.000 Let's true.
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000 My daughter's in this phase.
02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.000 Hopefully short where she's comparing her body
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000 with other people's body.
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000 Oh yeah.
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.000 That'll be a short phase.
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000 It only lasts like 500 years.
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000 So man, it kind of makes you think like,
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000 Oh shoot.
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000 She's paying attention now.
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000 She's going to get in your gut.
02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.000 And it's going to.
02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:51.000 Oh yeah.
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000 Whatever.
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:53.000 Anyway.
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:54.000 So.
02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000 What is your when they're going to do curls?
02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.000 Yeah.
02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.000 Pushups.
02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000 Actually she does burp.
02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:01.000 You know what I tell her?
02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000 It's kind of a trick.
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000 I don't know.
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000 Tell me if you think this is a lie.
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:08.000 So she'll be like, hey, I don't really feel like doing the workout today.
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.000 So I say, okay, you don't have to do the workout.
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000 If.
02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000 And only if you do burpees and pushups.
02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000 Kind of like burpees and pushups are not the workout.
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000 Even though that is the workout.
02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000 Oh yeah.
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:26.000 It's like 70 burpees and like 40 pushups or something like that.
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000 That's the whole workout.
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000 I'm going to make a six year old do a full on met Connor and nothing like that.
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000 But I say, you don't have to do the workout.
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000 You only have to do the pushups.
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000 The burps.
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000 She's like, okay.
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000 You know, kind of like she has to work out even though that is where is that lying?
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000 That's flanking, right?
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000 Yeah.
02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.000 It's a flake.
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:42.000 Hell yeah.
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000 And the last step.
02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000 You're good.
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000 I'd say.
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.000 Yeah.
02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000 I mean, you know, when when you know, she's still a girl.
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.000 She's just a power body looks in all this stuff and being a sex man.
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.000 And I kind of feel this overwhelming responsibility.
02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:02.000 Like, hey, if she starts like putting on weight that she doesn't like or something like that,
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.000 it's kind of my fault.
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000 You know, at this point it is.
02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.000 For sure.
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000 So the more you can feel real good about it, especially that she likes it.
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000 You know, and that's job very one is, I don't know how they did that.
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000 But keep doing it.
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000 That's what I know.
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000 Anyway, also, juggle white tea.
02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000 Yes.
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000 Can you get addicted to juggle white tea?
02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000 The answer is yes.
02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000 Yes.
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000 It's psychological.
02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000 J.P. to know.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000 And I mean, I'm sure I haven't thought about that much, but I'm sure there is some drawbacks.
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:43.000 Being addicted to juggle white tea.
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.000 I don't know.
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:47.000 But from here, I mean, the intuitive thought is that man.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000 Rashcards.
02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000 Rashcards.
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000 A big time.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000 Oh, yeah.
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000 If you want to represent the path while you're on the spot.
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000 And a rashcard today when I was doing a ring workout.
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.000 Go on.
02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.000 Ring.
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000 So I was using the rings.
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.000 And if you don't wear a rashcard when you're doing rings, if you do high reps,
02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000 you'll start to shave your arms a bunch.
02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000 Which is no big deal.
02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000 But then you get like, you know, you're if you're doing jiu-jitsu, then you're starting to get a little
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000 infection exposures going on.
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000 So just wear a rashcard.
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000 Yeah.
02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:01.000 Also, you know, if you work at the bank or somewhere where people sort of have to have at least a little bit of trust in you.
02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000 If you're rolling around with shaved hands and arms and stuff, they're like, oh, proud.
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.000 What's up with this guy, you know?
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000 They don't know that you're doing a rashcard.
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:07.000 I actually just feel like that more.
02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.000 Well, yeah, you, but you're like, you're like one, two levels like beyond.
02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000 You know, like in fight club.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000 He's like, he gives him the nod, but an on-pours sense.
02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000 Like, probably this guy with two black eyes broken nose, shaved arms, all this stuff.
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.000 Who is this guy?
02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000 Is a weirdo.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000 He's doing deviant stuff.
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000 That's for sure.
02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000 So you don't want that.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000 Like the warrior kid podcast is by no means dead,
02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000 It lives on.
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:44.000 Yeah.
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000 And since I have just wrapped up a major project,
02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000 I will have some time, hopefully before.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000 Then it could go and notice when it does come back.
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000 And the last, it's going to come back.
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000 It doesn't have to come back.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:51.000 Otherwise, go watch some more junk profiles.
02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000 I don't really watch that one.
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.000 But I will watch like fast tactical reloads.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.000 There's a bank and there's a donut shop right by where it is.
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000 Isn't it weird that donut shops exist?
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:24.000 Oh, they don't anymore. That was going to be my point.
02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000 Zero people in there.
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000 The lady in there.
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000 So we're winning.
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:27.000 You know what?
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000 We're winning.
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000 We're going to win.
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.000 I even heard what you call crispy creams is like, either out of business or
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.000 going out of business.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000 Record rate or something like this.
02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:43.000 But man, the lady in the donut shop was on her laptop in one of the
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000 customer like tables on the seat.
02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000 You know, it was she wasn't behind the counter.
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000 She was straight up.
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000 She was coming in here.
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000 Yeah.
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:51.000 I was like, dang.
02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000 Anyway, what should they replace all donut shops with?
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000 Stake houses.
02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000 Yeah.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000 Do you have two?

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.000 A vacant building.
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000 They clear out all the donut material and machines.
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000 I don't know how you make donuts.
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.000 But clear out all that stuff.
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.000 And you just put one like mat space.
02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.000 One mat space.
02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:19.000 That's it.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:31.000 But nonetheless, psychological warfare, what I was saying is the
02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000 Album tracks about Jocco, can you through your moments?
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:39.000 So what I've, what the report says that that psychological warfare, the album has
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.000 done massive damage to the donut industry apparently is what's going on.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000 It is nice.
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000 Yes.
02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000 You get that field manual and you're good to go.
02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:04.000 If you want the audio version that it's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google play and other MP3 platforms.
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000 And then, of course, you got extreme ownership.
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.000 And then I caught a meal of leadership, the two books that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin,
02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:16.80 talking about everything that we've learned in combat and how you can take those lessons.
02:44:16.80 --> 02:44:23.56 And you can utilize them with your business, with your team, with your life.
02:44:23.56 --> 02:44:24.56 So check those out.
02:44:24.56 --> 02:44:25.92 Also, we got echelon front.
02:44:25.92 --> 02:44:32.56 That's my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.
02:44:32.56 --> 02:44:37.000 If you problem that exists in your organization, it's a leadership problem.
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:43.56 So if you need help fixing that leadership problem and thereby fixing the problems that you have inside your organization,
02:44:43.56 --> 02:44:47.12 go to echelon front.com.
02:44:47.12 --> 02:44:56.16 If you need further instruction, if you want something beyond this podcast, if you want to come to the
02:44:56.16 --> 02:45:03.16 Master, the Master is a leadership training seminar, I guess.
02:45:03.16 --> 02:45:04.16 I'd call it.
02:45:04.16 --> 02:45:06.16 It's a leadership convention.
02:45:06.16 --> 02:45:12.16 And what we do is go deep dive, get granular on leadership.
02:45:12.16 --> 02:45:15.16 The next one is September 19th and 20th in Denver.
02:45:15.16 --> 02:45:19.16 And then after that, it's December 4th and 5th in Sydney, Australia.
02:45:19.16 --> 02:45:21.16 Every single, we've done seven.
02:45:21.16 --> 02:45:23.16 They've also told out these are going to sell out too.
02:45:23.16 --> 02:45:26.16 So if you want to come, go to treemonership.com and sign up.
02:45:26.16 --> 02:45:31.16 And if you can't come to that, you can go to efonline.com.
02:45:31.16 --> 02:45:41.16 And that's our leadership training interactive online platform where you can get the skills.
02:45:41.16 --> 02:45:44.16 You can reinforce the skills.
02:45:44.16 --> 02:45:48.16 The skills that I talk about on this podcast, the skills that we wrote about in the books,
02:45:48.16 --> 02:45:53.16 those skills need further training all the time.
02:45:53.16 --> 02:45:54.16 Never master these things.
02:45:54.16 --> 02:45:56.16 So go to efonline.com and check that out.
02:45:56.16 --> 02:46:03.16 And then there's, of course, a geof Overwatch where we've been taking proven leaders, tested
02:46:03.16 --> 02:46:09.16 leaders from special operations and from combat aviation and putting them into companies
02:46:09.16 --> 02:46:13.16 in the civilian sector that need leadership.
02:46:13.16 --> 02:46:17.16 So if you're looking to hire, don't always hire just because someone has experience.
02:46:17.16 --> 02:46:22.16 Higher, four character, higher, four leadership capability.
02:46:22.16 --> 02:46:27.16 And then you teach them the industry specifics because that's easier than trying to teach someone
02:46:27.16 --> 02:46:29.16 character or trying to teach someone leadership.
02:46:29.16 --> 02:46:33.16 You have full Overwatch.com if you need leadership.
02:46:33.16 --> 02:46:44.16 And if you want to converse with us further, then we are on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram,
02:46:44.16 --> 02:46:49.16 and on that shhh, face you blush.
02:46:49.16 --> 02:46:51.16 Echo is at Echo Charles.

02:47:38.16 --> 02:47:48.16 And we thank you for it. And to everyone else out there, you might be scared and you might be tired.
02:47:48.16 --> 02:47:56.16 And you might be surrounded by the enemy who is preparing to attack, but you know what?
02:47:56.16 --> 02:48:00.16 You're still alive.
02:48:00.16 --> 02:48:07.16 So get the high ground, set up your perimeter, lock and load your weapons, and go get after it.
02:48:07.16 --> 02:48:14.16 And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
