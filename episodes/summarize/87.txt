You know, like, you're, whatever the case may be, like, when everything's perfect, the little imperfections show themselves more, you know, like, if your life is like, everything's together, we're, you know, your job is good and your family's good or whatever, but meanwhile, like, you're, I don't know, your front lawn is going brown. So in jiu-jitsu when you first start, you know how like, like, guys, just going full speed the whole time, you know. You don't know if it's friendly, you don't know if it's a tank round being fired, you don't know if it's an ID going off, you don't know if it's a mortar round impact and you can't. We're going to get up, we're going to run as hard as we can, when we when we know we're going to get hit with the shell, we're going to get down and take cover. You can start supporting those, you know, kind of like, you know, when you throw sodium metal in water, you know? You know, you know, entering a situation where duty is going to be the most important thing to you, and you also know that the mission is the most important thing. You're like, my front lawn's going brown, you know, is like that kind of thing. And they watch like, you know, they watch like, Pippa pig or I don't know something. I think this is actually not a bad idea because, but you need to put, it's like when I do something else, you stuff on the minute, what makes me nervous about what you're saying is like, I like rest for about 30 seconds. You know, snipers know that, hey, this thing, they get it down to really, you know, how many meters it is, and same thing with a good mortarman. You know, when all things are going real good, it's easy to point out the things that are not going good. It will be surprised that the weight you can get, like, let's say, you know, you picked the right weight that you can, like I do this 10 times. You know how like you go from thing to thing and you're like, hey, I've been to go to one thing on me. This is kind of my thought, my thought process on it is I'm going to do a certain kind of work capacity, you know, like a five reps of this and five reps of this. This isn't a guy who's saying, look, hey, we're going to charge this machine gun nest and I'm going to lose it, you know, half my platoon. You know, when I see our jockel podcast on, you know, number, whatever, where it appears like between one and 10 in the business section, that is good. Because they were, it was like, because there were the mix between these big, kind of almost like, bullies, not bullies, like, ugly people. You know, even if you don't know, you're like, well, consider the source kind of thing. But they were like, you know, when you play video game, you come against the boss who you look at him, you're like, I can't beat this guy. And you know that that was very interesting in the, I don't know if you remember some of those police shootings where I remember there's one in New York City where something like 57 rounds were fired at somebody that was unarmed. As opposed to, you know, I don't know, fire at will or, you know, all these other things that you hear. They know the exact, because what you, what you have to, you know the distance, Yeah, you know the distance at the mortar shoots at a certain elevation. You know, instead of making movies about Saint Low, they make movies about the aliens attacking or whatever, you know, so we just, it's pretty easy to forget that the reason we're here and the reason we're not speaking German is when the reason we're not speaking Japanese is because of this warrior culture here, which kind of, it's right up there. You've got to put that at the top of your priorities, and you know you're going to sacrifice guys and it's going to be a nightmare. When you, when you can sit or, like, even, let's say the Spartans, and you consider all their things, stop, this is like hand to hand sword to neck battles, just like dang that's, that's savage. And there's he's standing in his new command post and these new guys, he sees like a position that needs to be taken to make sure that you know we have some security around the command post. The guys were, you know, somebody said, hey, somebody grabbed the person that shot, hey, that was an AD, okay, wrap it back down, wind it down, everyone calm, you know what I mean? I like reading the reviews, but yeah, if you feel like leaving one, apparently it's like it helps. All right, at this point and also just like some of the other books we've read about World War II where we've got, you know, it's basically a movement. Like when you say, I'm going to do a weight 20 times, what I can, you know, say for lack of a better turn. I'm like, guys down, I'm going, you know. I know the compulsion, like I know the feeling. And speaking of Hawaii, like Kay, you know, like the, And You guys are pushing forward on the attack, and you take away, you chip away at them a little bit, you give them ground, you give them ground, and then when they get spread out, they're low on ammunition, boom, then you hit them on a counter attack, on a ground that you already know. I guess if you do this like, you never know what's going to happen. You know, like how it'll work and who's going to, he is. So it's a continual series of attack, dig in, attack, dig in, attack, dig in and you can tell from the title of the book, what they're going for is this final, you know, city of St. Low in France. They realize John's realizes that look, we're going to be, and the title of the book is clay pigeons, you know what a clay pigeon is right? It's funny too because when we talk about Battalion staff, you talk about, I don't know, a Battalion staff can be pretty big when you're in a big Battalion, but this is not a big group, this small group. What he said afterwards, he's like, hey, next time you work out, can you let me know? And I'll tell you what happens is, you know, for some reason they think, if you think somebody has a weapon or a suspect or is going to do something bad. So it's like, when he kind of says he can't help but be like, ah, you're right. So that night, he has a little company little huddle with the company commanders and you know, just to just to kind of spell this out if you're wondering what this is all about.
