00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 82 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening echo.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was walking down the street and I was pretty sure I would die and I did not mind.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In fact, a large part of me looked forward to it, to that release, to go to heaven, to meet Christ

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for it all to be over.

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I recorded death like a sailor courts, a twirling Spanish bar made.

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was not afraid even as we tried to cross broken streets with asphalt and makeshift concrete piled

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
like sloppy cake icing hiding the surprises below.

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Large IDs and screams and blood and burning flesh and burning vehicle tires all superficially

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
hidden all obviously present all a joke.

12
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And at the forefront of my mind and part of my decision to become a soldier at all.

13
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And that's what I considered myself, a soldier, a grunt and infantryman, a ground pounder, a soldier.

14
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What else is there?

15
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We all turned into soldiers on patrol.

16
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We competed with each other and the men and other units and other services to see who could patrol

17
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
in the most disciplined way.

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We would see who we could catch staring at his feet or not watching his field of fire or not scanning for threats.

19
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We're not keeping his shooting hand on his gun.

20
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And when the shooting did start, we would watch to see who would panic and who would cower.

21
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
These were seemingly fun games and recesses breaking up the fear which was so overpowering,

22
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it put a deep ache in our stomachs and in our bowels.

23
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
There was chaos that brought me to this point.

24
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Wild music as a young boy, slayer, matallica in their prime, venom, motorhead.

25
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Heavy alcohol used by age 10.

26
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Drug use by age 11.

27
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Late night punk concerts and mosh pits were at nearly lost my front tooth at age 12 as it dug deeply into a punk's shaved head.

28
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I was tall for my age and people treated me like an adult.

29
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
They tried to bring me into their filth.

30
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Junkies perverts to generates an evil world burning.

31
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So much so that war was a dream come true.

32
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It seemed as if now I could fight back against the depravity and evil that tried to engulf me.

33
00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And I held that quiet hope, that unspoken hope that maybe I could die in war, doing something heroic like they trained us to do.

34
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Maybe this God forsaken and worthless life could be over.

35
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This gauntletten.

36
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And so the IED-laden roads attempting to scare me and us were a joke.

37
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And I did not care about it.

38
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:42.000
About the setup, about the punchline, I just wanted enemy contact and I wanted to smell the blood of particles floating through the afternoon air.

39
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And the screams of the dying, that is what I wanted.

40
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It seemed so beautiful.

41
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
My mind had romanticized it all.

42
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But what we got wasn't so romantic, isn't so beautiful.

43
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Most of the screams I heard were the screams of my countrymen as they bled, or the screams of innocence who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

44
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I watched the funerals of men we shot, going right past us, the children crying, the wives glaring as they damned us with ancient Babylonian curses that would try to follow me.

45
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I tried to follow me back to my home in Satanic nightmares where I could not escape them.

46
00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:02.000
All those things made death so true and so beautiful and so acceptable.

47
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now those words were written by someone that I served with in Ramadi in 2006 and he sent them to me the other day after we talked and asked him to write down what he thought about.

48
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:51.000
He was walking down the street in Ramadi and obviously what he wrote about, get revealed so much of the incredible spectrum of emotions and thoughts that run through our heads.

49
00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And obviously, we're magnifies those, but these are thoughts of a human being and these are the kind of thoughts that people have not just in war but in life.

50
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And I was sitting thinking about that word and that the fact that struggle, it absolutely shapes us.

51
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And I was talking about this when I was with Joe Rogan and Chris Cornell from Sound Garden had just killed himself and we were talking about the struggles and Joe was saying that the struggle, you got to kind of like struggle and you need struggle, people need struggle and some of the feedback that I saw on social media was,

52
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you know, there's a difference between struggle and challenge and that a challenge is good but struggle is bad and and you know, I don't know and I'm not wishing struggles upon anyone.

53
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I'm the guru but I do know that struggle and strife shapes us. It shapes us. There's no doubt. And as I was thinking about this, I started thinking about a bunch of different books that I've read in the past.

54
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And one of them is a book called And We Go On. And it was written by a guy named Will are bird who's from Nova Scotia, Canada and he was a soldier in the Canadian Army in World War I.

55
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And he'd enlisted in the army to replace his brother. So his brother had been killed in battle and he said, okay, I need to I need to enlist now and at first he couldn't enlist because he had bad teeth.

56
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And then as more and more guys got killed, they loosened the standards and they allowed him in even with his bad teeth.

57
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And the book is very different. And we're not going to go through the whole book today, but what makes the book different is he talks about.

58
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Like the supernatural and he wrote another book as a matter of fact, which is called ghosts have warm hands. And so this kind of supernatural world is something he spends some pretty decent amount of time on.

59
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And in the beginning of the book, one of the things that he says is the trench at zero hour was a crucible that dissolved all in sincerity and the superficial.

60
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And you can clearly imagine that these guys getting ready to go over the top. I mean, what else matters at that point.

61
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Everything that's not true is everything that is not sincere just means nothing at that point.

62
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And I'm going to go to the book here for a minute.

63
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And here's one of the things he said about sort of again, I've just started thinking about the psychological side of what people are going through.

64
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So here we go to the book. This story is an effort to reveal a side of war that has not been given much attention. The psychic effect it had on its participants.

65
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There existed before all battles, and even in the calms of the trench routine, a condition before which all natural explanations failed that no supernatural explanations were established.

66
00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Every human emotion ran its full gamut in that land of topsy-turvy and prolonged intensity of feeling rot, feeling rot strange psychological changes which warped the soul itself.

67
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Never on earth was there a place where a man's support often his soul support was his faith in some mighty power. All intervening thoughts were swept aside unconsciously.

68
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:41.000
There were born faiths that men carried through critical moments and tortured minds, grasp fantasies that served in place of more solid creeds.

69
00:11:41.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I think it's interesting that he says warped the soul. And I don't actually think, again, I'm no literary expert, but I don't think he means that with the negative connotation of warped being negative and bad, but I think he means like a departure from the normal, a departure from the straight line.

70
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Moving away from the natural direction, and so it leaves men changed.

71
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And like I said, I'm not going to cover this whole book, we'll probably do it at some point in the future.

72
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But I think when he gets to the end of the book and he makes some statements that are pretty powerful. And of course this is now after he's gone through the war and he's on a ship sailing back to Canada.

73
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And I'm going to read this section. Here we go back to the book, darkness, the rush of the ship.

74
00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I felt my way again into a stifling dugout into an atmosphere rancid with stale sweat and breathing, earth mold and the hot grease of candles.

75
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I saw faces, cheeks resting on tunics, mud streaked, unshaven dirty faces with some with teeth clenched and sudden hate, some live it with pulsed stopping fear.

76
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So men turning on their wire bunks, quivering as if some red hot grill. I heard them gasp and sob and cry out in agony and mutter as they tossed again.

77
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Then a machine guns note, louder, higher, sharper, crack, crack, crack, as it sweeps over you in a shell hole where you hug the earth. The growl of guttle voices heavy steps in an unseen trench just the other side of the black mass of tangled barbed barricade beside which you cower.

78
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.000
The long drawn wine of a shell, its heart gripping explosion, the terrible oppressive silence that follows.

79
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Then the first little whale of the man who is down with a gaping blood spurting wound.

80
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I moved about shook myself sniffed the salt there and tried to rid myself of my dreams. And as I stood there, there came a sudden chill.

81
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I grew cold as if I had entered a clammy cavern. I could not understand but went and got my great coat.

82
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:46.000
A dim figure passed me as I returned to the deck and a voice said, we're getting nearer home. I can feel the change.

83
00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I knew we had left the warm current and we're into the icy waters nearer home. We had left behind the comrade ship of long hours on the trench post and patrols, long days under blazing suns and crew marches on cobbled roads.

84
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:19.000
The brotherhood of the line and we were entering a cold sea facing the dark, the unknown we could not escape.

85
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Dark figures came and stood beside me. I had not thought that anyone, save myself would come on deck and hear they were, ten a dozen, still more, all hunched in great coats silent, staring.

86
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I looked at my watch, there was three o'clock in the morning. These men could not sleep. They were come to see the first lights of Halifax.

87
00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I moved quietly among them, scanning each blurred face. It was as I thought. They were all old timers, the men of the trenches.

88
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:20.000
We went on and on and on and no one spoke though we touched shoulders. I tried to think of a comparison.

89
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:34.000
We were like prisoners. I had seen them standing like that without speaking, staring, thinking prisoners.

90
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:52.000
We were prisoners who could never escape. I had been trying to imagine how I would express my feelings when I got home. And now I knew I never could. None of us could.

91
00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:14.000
We could know more make ourselves articulate than could those who would not return. We were in a world apart prisoners in chains that would never loosen till death freed us.

92
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And I knew those at home would never understand. They would be impatient, wondering why we were so dumb, unable to put our experiences into words.

93
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And there would be many of the boys who would be surly, taciturn, moody, resenting good intentions, perhaps taking to hard liquor and aimless drifting.

94
00:17:41.000 --> 00:18:05.000
We of the brotherhood could understand the soldier but never explain him. All of us would remain a separate definite people as if branded by some monstrous despotism.

95
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I warmed as I fought of all that the brotherhood had meant. The sharing of blankets and bread and hardships, the binding of each other's wounds.

96
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:31.000
The talks we had had of intimate things of the dog and simple faith that men had showed flashes of their inner cells that strengthened one's own soul.

97
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Perhaps when my bitterness passed, when I had got back to normal self to loved ones tried hard by years of waiting, I would find that despite that horror which I could never forget.

98
00:18:47.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I had equalizing treasure in memories I could use like Jacob's ladder to get high enough to see that even war itself could never be the whole of life.

99
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:17.000
The watcher stirred, I tingled, my throat tightened. Waves of emotion seized me, held me.

100
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I grew hot and cold at queer sensations. Every man had tenced, crane forward yet no one spoke.

101
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:47.000
It was the moment for which we had lived, which we had dreamed, visioned, pictured a thousand times, it held us now so enthralled, so full of feeling that we could not find utterance.

102
00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:14.000
A million thrills ran through me. Far ahead, faint, but growing brighter, we had glimpsed the first lights of home.

103
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:40.000
And that line when he says, perhaps when my bitterness passed and I could use my memories and he said he could use his memories like Jacob's ladder to get high enough to see that even war itself could never be the whole of life.

104
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And those are the struggles he's talking about, those are the hardships.

105
00:20:47.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And this change in his mindset to not let those drag him down, but to use those to climb up.

106
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And I think we lose track of that sometimes. And all we see is the trench, and we get stuck in the trench.

107
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And I think it's interesting that these men, literally and metaphorically speaking, these men were in trenches, but they were able to rise out of these trenches.

108
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And I think they are able to rise out of those hellish trenches.

109
00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And that means we can too.

110
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And again, this thing that my buddy sent me, they just got me thinking about that psychological turmoil of war.

111
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And that sent me into thoughts of another book again, another book that I read a while back, I remember when I read it, but I just started thinking about it.

112
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:39.000
And this one was about Vietnam. And it's a classic. It's called the Rumor of War. And again, we'll absolutely cover this book on the podcast and detail at some point.

113
00:22:39.000 --> 00:23:02.000
But I'm kind of just was on this literally tore mode. And the psyche, I think it's just a good view of the psyche that people have in war, which again reflects life.

114
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:17.000
And there's a section in this book where Phil Caputo is assigned to a re-reślant unit. He's in the rear. And he's a lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He's in the rear.

115
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And I think he's in a regimental command post or something, but he's not fighting. And here's what he thinks of that going to the book.

116
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000
In the middle of November, that my own request, I was transferred to a line company in First Battalion.

117
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:47.000
My convictions about the war had eroded almost to nothing. I had no illusions, but I had volunteered for a line company anyway.

118
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:57.000
There were a number of reasons of which the paramount was boredom. There was nothing for me to do, but count casualties.

119
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I felt useless and a little guilty about living in relative safety while other men risked their lives.

120
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I cannot deny that the front still held fascination for me. The rights are wrongs of the war aside. There was a magnetism about combat.

121
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:27.000
You seem to live more intensely under fire. Every sense was sharper, the mind worked clearer and faster.

122
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Perhaps it was the tension of opposites that made it so and attraction balanced by a revolting hope that warred with dread.

123
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:52.000
You found yourself on a precarious emotional edge experience experiencing a headiness that no drink or drug could match.

124
00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:06.000
The fear of madness was another motive. The hallucination I had had in that day and the mess of seeing more unharic and prefigured in death had become a constant waking nightmare.

125
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000
I had begun to see almost everyone as they would look in death, including myself.

126
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Shaving in the mirror in the morning, I could see myself dead.

127
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Then there were moments when I not only saw my own corpse, but other people looking at it.

128
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I saw life going on without me. The sensation of not being anymore came over me at night just before falling asleep.

129
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Sometimes it made me laugh inside.

130
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
I could not take myself seriously when I could already see my own death.

131
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Nor seeing their deaths as well could I take other seriously.

132
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:57.000
We were all the victims of a great practical joke played on us by God or nature.

133
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Maybe that was why corpses always grinned. They saw the joke at the last moment.

134
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Sometimes it made me laugh, but most of the time it was not at all humorous.

135
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And I was sure that another few months of identifying bodies would land me in a psychiatric ward.

136
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
On staff there was too much time to brood over those corpses.

137
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
There would be very little time to think in a line company.

138
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000
That is the secret to emotional survival in war, not thinking.

139
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Finally, there was hatred. A hatred buried so deep that I could not then admit its existence.

140
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
I can now, though it is still painful.

141
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
I burned with a hatred for the vehicle and with an emotion that dwells in most of us,

142
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:04.000
one closer to the surface than we care to admit a desire for retribution.

143
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I did not hate the enemy for their politics, but for murdering Simpson, for executing that boy who's body had been found in the river,

144
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
for blasting the life out of Walt Levy.

145
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Revenge was one of the reasons I volunteered for a line company.

146
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I wanted a chance to kill somebody.

147
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And you could see even in that, comparing that with the first piece of things being a joke.

148
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And how you just get to this point where things become a joke, how can you take anything seriously?

149
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
When you don't even know what's going to happen, and if you're going to live,

150
00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:01.000
how much meaning does life have if you're not going to live it?

151
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:10.000
It gets back out to a line company and now he's on patrol talking about,

152
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:19.000
not only what that's like externally, but what it's like mentally, psychologically, going back to the book.

153
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I tightened the shoulder straps of my pack heavily loaded with signal flares, smoke grenades, dry socks, a poncho, and three days rations.

154
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And in trenching tool and machete were lashed to its side.

155
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000
In my pockets, I cared a map, compass, hangar nades, more flares, Hallezone tablets, malaria pills, and a spare magazine for my car bean.

156
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000
A pistol, two clips of ammunition, knife, first aid kit, and two full cantines hung from my belt.

157
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
My steel helmet and flat jacket added 20 pounds to the load.

158
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.000
The gear probably weighed over 40 pounds altogether, but I felt a wonderful, soaring lightness in my limbs.

159
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
I felt good all over better than I had felt in months.

160
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Even Neil, who was not inclined to hand out compliments, had praised my gun-ho enthusiasm before the platoon left the base camp.

161
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
As sudden and mysterious recovery from the virus of fear had caused the change in mood, I don't know why.

162
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I only knew I had ceased to be afraid of dying.

163
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
There was not a feeling of invincibility in difference, rather.

164
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
I had ceased to fear death because I had ceased to care about it.

165
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Certainly, I had no illusions that my death, if it came, would be a sacrifice.

166
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
It would merely be a death, and not a good one either.

167
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
A good death involved a certain amount of choice, ritual, and style.

168
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
There were no good deaths in the war.

169
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
But the manner of dying no longer mattered.

170
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
I didn't care how death came, so long as it came quickly and painlessly.

171
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
I would die as casually as a beetle is crushed under a boot heel.

172
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And perhaps it was this recognition of my insect-like pettingess that had made me stop caring.

173
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
That was a beetle.

174
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
We were all beetles scratching for survival in the wilderness.

175
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Those who had lost the struggle had not changed anything by dying.

176
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:51.000
The deaths of Levi, Simpson, Sullivan, and the others had not made any difference.

177
00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Thousands of people died each week in the war, and the sum of all their deaths did not make any difference.

178
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
The war went on without them.

179
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And as it went on without them, so would it go on without me.

180
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
My death would not alter a thing.

181
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Walking down the trail, I could not remember having felt an emotion more sublime or liberating

182
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000
than that indifference toward my own death.

183
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Again, a common fought pattern is this feeling of, hey, I'm in hell and one thing like tuna set me free is death.

184
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:56.000
And once I overcome that, that just allows me to go and do what I'm supposed to do.

185
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And I'm just going to fast forward once again, kind of like with the will bird going to the end where

186
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
where kaputo kind of wraps up his, what he's going to bring home from the war.

187
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And at this point, he's obviously survived the enemy. He's survived actually at this point. He survived a court martial

188
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
because he'd gotten in some trouble. There was some bad things that happened while he was in charge.

189
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
There was, you know, cases against him.

190
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
And he kind of got out of that situation.

191
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And now he is heading home.

192
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Going back to the book.

193
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
But we stood waiting in the sun at the edge of the runway.

194
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:49.000
There were about 150 of us. And we watched his replacement draft filed off the big transport plane.

195
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000
They fell into formation and tried to ignore the dusty, tanned, ragged-looking men who jirged

196
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
them.

197
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.50
The replacements looked strangely young, far younger than we, and awkward and bewildered by this scorched

198
00:33:05.50 --> 00:33:11.50
land to which an indifferent government had sent them.

199
00:33:11.50 --> 00:33:14.50
I did not join in the mockery.

200
00:33:14.50 --> 00:33:21.000
I felt sorry for those children knowing that they would all grow old in this land of endless

201
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
dying.

202
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.50
I pityed them.

203
00:33:26.50 --> 00:33:31.50
Knowing that out of every ten one would die.

204
00:33:31.50 --> 00:33:37.50
The more would be maimed for life, another two would be less seriously wounded and sent out to fight again.

205
00:33:37.50 --> 00:33:45.50
And all the rest would be wounded in other, more hidden ways.

206
00:33:45.50 --> 00:33:52.50
The replacements were marched off toward the convoys that awaited to carry them to their assigned units and their assigned

207
00:33:52.50 --> 00:33:54.50
feats.

208
00:33:54.50 --> 00:33:57.50
None of them looked at us.

209
00:33:57.50 --> 00:34:00.50
They marched away.

210
00:34:00.50 --> 00:34:04.50
Shouldering our sea bags, we climbed up the ramp into the plane.

211
00:34:04.50 --> 00:34:06.50
The plane we had all dreamed about.

212
00:34:06.50 --> 00:34:10.50
The grand mythological freedom bird.

213
00:34:10.50 --> 00:34:18.50
A joyous shout went up as the transport lurched off the runway and climbed into the placid sky.

214
00:34:18.50 --> 00:34:29.50
Blow lay the rice patties and the green folded hills where we had all lost our friends and our youth.

215
00:34:29.50 --> 00:34:39.50
The plane banked and headed out over the China Sea towards Okinawa, toward Freedom from deaths in brace.

216
00:34:39.50 --> 00:34:43.50
None of us was a hero.

217
00:34:43.50 --> 00:34:51.50
We would not return to cheering crowds parades and the peeling of great cathedral bells.

218
00:34:51.50 --> 00:34:56.50
We had done nothing more than endure.

219
00:34:56.50 --> 00:35:11.50
We had survived and that was our only victory.

220
00:35:11.50 --> 00:35:16.50
And I think that is important for us to remember.

221
00:35:16.50 --> 00:35:25.50
That in some cases, some of the things that we go through, some of the things, some of the challenges and tribulations and trials that people get put through.

222
00:35:25.50 --> 00:35:29.50
Sometimes survival is victory.

223
00:35:29.50 --> 00:35:35.50
And all you can do is survive and make it through a situation that you're in.

224
00:35:35.50 --> 00:35:44.50
And I think sometimes when people survive something horrible, instead of being happy or related that they made it through.

225
00:35:44.50 --> 00:35:50.50
Instead they focus on the fact that they got put through it.

226
00:35:50.50 --> 00:35:55.50
And again, I don't know professional at all.

227
00:35:55.50 --> 00:36:03.50
There was even when I was on Jill Rogan's podcast and we were talking about Chris Cornell committing suicide.

228
00:36:03.50 --> 00:36:11.50
Someone said, because we kind of devolved into a conversation of hey, get outside and Tim Ferriss went.

229
00:36:11.50 --> 00:36:16.50
Tim Ferriss was on this podcast. He was saying, get moving, get physical.

230
00:36:16.50 --> 00:36:23.50
So Joe and I were just kind of talking about that and someone came on and said, you know, you don't know what you're talking about.

231
00:36:23.50 --> 00:36:28.50
It's it's you're lucky to survive something like this. It's horrible.

232
00:36:28.50 --> 00:36:32.50
And you know, I kind of said, man, I know I'm not saying that.

233
00:36:32.50 --> 00:36:40.50
And literally I'd read, listen to Joe and I talking and both of us what we were saying was, over and over again, I don't understand this.

234
00:36:40.50 --> 00:36:45.50
I don't comprehend it. You know, so I don't think that was the intention was saying,

235
00:36:45.50 --> 00:36:50.50
oh, all you have to do is go get out of kettlebell and you'll be good to go. That's not the intention at all.

236
00:36:50.50 --> 00:36:56.50
And that's not what either one of us, not only was it, not what you're trying to say, we didn't actually say that.

237
00:36:56.50 --> 00:37:01.50
We were saying, hey, I don't understand it. I haven't been in that position before.

238
00:37:01.50 --> 00:37:10.50
That's why we brought Tim on here because Tim had lived through that and knew how bad it was and planned to kill himself.

239
00:37:10.50 --> 00:37:21.50
So that to me is someone that can give their opinion. Joe and I were literally saying, I don't comprehend.

240
00:37:21.50 --> 00:37:37.50
But I think when you get a guy like the author of this book, a rumor of war, who's talking about their victory or his victory and the people on the plate, their victory in Vietnam was survival was just getting through it.

241
00:37:37.50 --> 00:37:47.50
And I know that's nothing you're going to be joyous about, but I think at least recognizing, okay, I made it through, now let me move on.

242
00:37:47.50 --> 00:37:52.50
Yeah, is important.

243
00:37:52.50 --> 00:38:01.50
Now again, I went on this kind of literary tour that I was launched into after reading what my buddy wrote,

244
00:38:01.50 --> 00:38:10.50
because it reminded me of so many other things that I've heard and so many other things that I've read.

245
00:38:10.50 --> 00:38:22.50
And so another great viewpoint comes from Eugene Sledge and he wrote the book with the old breed, which is a classic.

246
00:38:22.50 --> 00:38:33.50
And we covered it podcast number 10. If you want to stop now, go back and listen to podcast 10 with Eugene Sledge with Eugene Sledge with the old breed.

247
00:38:33.50 --> 00:38:43.50
It's just incredible account of what he went through in World War II in the Pacific Theater with the Marine Corps.

248
00:38:43.50 --> 00:38:48.50
But he wrote another book after that. And the next book, the wrote, was called China Marine.

249
00:38:48.50 --> 00:38:53.50
And it talks about what they did when the war ended.

250
00:38:53.50 --> 00:39:00.50
You know, and the time he spent sort of pacifying in any country, spent some time in China.

251
00:39:00.50 --> 00:39:08.50
And then it talks about what it was like when he got back to America, back to Mobile Alabama.

252
00:39:08.50 --> 00:39:19.50
And it's definitely impactful, definitely impactful. So here's what he came to came home to.

253
00:39:19.50 --> 00:39:26.50
And I'm going to pick up where his dad, he's talking to his dad and his dad was a physician during World War I.

254
00:39:26.50 --> 00:39:33.50
And that's one of the reasons his dad was, if you remember Eugene Sledge couldn't get in the Marine Corps at first, because he had,

255
00:39:33.50 --> 00:39:38.50
I think he had a heart murmur or something like that. And so they didn't let him in.

256
00:39:38.50 --> 00:39:41.50
And his dad was kind of okay with that.

257
00:39:41.50 --> 00:39:47.50
And the reason he was okay with that was because he had seen what the boys from World War I had come home like,

258
00:39:47.50 --> 00:39:50.50
not only physically, but also psychologically.

259
00:39:50.50 --> 00:39:56.50
Guys had the shell shock, which is horrible when you see it.

260
00:39:56.50 --> 00:40:00.50
And again, I've said this before going YouTube and look at videos of World War I's shell shock.

261
00:40:00.50 --> 00:40:06.50
It's horrifying to look at. And that's what Eugene Sledge's father had seen.

262
00:40:06.50 --> 00:40:13.50
And so when his son couldn't go in the Marine Corps, he was kind of like, okay, you know, you can serve in other ways,

263
00:40:13.50 --> 00:40:16.50
and Eugene Sledge wanted to serve.

264
00:40:16.50 --> 00:40:22.50
And so Eugene Sledge, he actually got a waiver and I guess the heart murmur had faded enough for

265
00:40:22.50 --> 00:40:24.50
they didn't notice it until we got the Marine Corps.

266
00:40:24.50 --> 00:40:31.50
But when he comes back, his dad, his dad is talking to him and I think it's a good place to pick up.

267
00:40:31.50 --> 00:40:35.50
His dad called him Fritz. That was Eugene Sledge's nickname at home.

268
00:40:35.50 --> 00:40:42.50
So here we go. Eugene Sledge's dad talking to him Fritz. He said,

269
00:40:42.50 --> 00:40:45.50
I know you've been through an awful experience.

270
00:40:45.50 --> 00:40:48.50
I know that nobody had it worse than the first Marine Division,

271
00:40:48.50 --> 00:40:53.50
except maybe those on baton and those others who were imprisoned.

272
00:40:53.50 --> 00:40:58.50
I'm tremendously proud of both you and Edward.

273
00:40:58.50 --> 00:41:02.50
You did your duty under terrifying conditions, but you survived in one piece,

274
00:41:02.50 --> 00:41:07.50
granted with some terrible memories you'll have to learn to live with.

275
00:41:07.50 --> 00:41:10.50
But take my advice.

276
00:41:10.50 --> 00:41:17.50
First, never become and bitter because many other men had safe, comfortable war assignments,

277
00:41:17.50 --> 00:41:21.50
all too often obtained through political influence.

278
00:41:21.50 --> 00:41:25.50
That's the way of cowards in this world.

279
00:41:25.50 --> 00:41:30.50
Two, never feel sorry for yourself because of what you endured.

280
00:41:30.50 --> 00:41:35.50
On the contrary, feel fiercely proud that you served with the finest

281
00:41:35.50 --> 00:41:40.50
and fought against the fiercest enemy and lived to tell the tale.

282
00:41:40.50 --> 00:41:45.50
Three, if you ever drink alcohol, do it in moderation.

283
00:41:45.50 --> 00:41:49.50
Alcohol can be a wonderful escape from bad memories,

284
00:41:49.50 --> 00:41:56.50
but it is addictive. We'll make you act the fool and ultimately ruin you.

285
00:41:56.50 --> 00:41:59.50
To the last remark, I replied, I know father,

286
00:41:59.50 --> 00:42:01.50
I've seen that happen to good buddies,

287
00:42:01.50 --> 00:42:05.50
recalling some of the worst cases in China.

288
00:42:05.50 --> 00:42:11.50
He replied, yes, and I've treated some of the nicest people who were ruined by the stuff.

289
00:42:11.50 --> 00:42:18.50
But I can't cure them. They must have willpower.

290
00:42:18.50 --> 00:42:23.50
So really straightforward warning about alcohol,

291
00:42:23.50 --> 00:42:32.50
check about not feeling bitter towards people that didn't maybe do or go through what he went through.

292
00:42:32.50 --> 00:42:35.50
And be proud of what you did.

293
00:42:35.50 --> 00:42:42.50
Now, this is, again, just another piece that they actually,

294
00:42:42.50 --> 00:42:45.50
in the HBO miniseries, the Pacific,

295
00:42:45.50 --> 00:42:50.50
they kind of portray this part of Eugene's alleged coming home.

296
00:42:50.50 --> 00:42:55.50
But it's worth reading his account of it back to the book.

297
00:42:55.50 --> 00:42:59.50
As my life settled down somewhat, I began to think of my future.

298
00:42:59.50 --> 00:43:02.50
Rather hastily, I decided to go to Auburn,

299
00:43:02.50 --> 00:43:07.50
then called Alabama Polytechnic Institute and Major in Business.

300
00:43:07.50 --> 00:43:10.50
I'll never forget my first day at Auburn.

301
00:43:10.50 --> 00:43:13.50
I was in the Registrar's office in Sanford Hall.

302
00:43:13.50 --> 00:43:17.50
The big room was crowded with long lines of entering students,

303
00:43:17.50 --> 00:43:20.50
standing in front of tables behind which clerks were noticing,

304
00:43:20.50 --> 00:43:24.50
or noting each student's college credits from service schools,

305
00:43:24.50 --> 00:43:27.50
determining which might transfer to Auburn.

306
00:43:27.50 --> 00:43:31.50
There was a loud hub hub of voices with about a hundred people in the room.

307
00:43:31.50 --> 00:43:36.50
Some men, mostly air core veterans, had been to various technical schools,

308
00:43:36.50 --> 00:43:39.50
and Auburn gave them two years credit.

309
00:43:39.50 --> 00:43:44.50
All veterans were excused from ROTC and physical education.

310
00:43:44.50 --> 00:43:47.50
When I stepped up to the table at the head of the line,

311
00:43:47.50 --> 00:43:51.50
a pretty brunette about my age, probably a student's wife,

312
00:43:51.50 --> 00:43:55.50
asked pleasantly what schools I had attended in the Marine Corps.

313
00:43:55.50 --> 00:43:59.50
I recited all the weapons and tactic schools we had in training.

314
00:43:59.50 --> 00:44:03.50
She became more and more disconcerting as she looked in vain

315
00:44:03.50 --> 00:44:08.50
on her checklist for anything remotely resembling what I was saying.

316
00:44:08.50 --> 00:44:12.50
Finally, in desperation, she slammed her pencil on the table

317
00:44:12.50 --> 00:44:14.50
and said in the loud, exasperated voice,

318
00:44:14.50 --> 00:44:17.50
didn't the Marine Corps teach you anything.

319
00:44:17.50 --> 00:44:22.50
A gas brand threw the crowd and you could have heard a pin drop.

320
00:44:22.50 --> 00:44:26.50
I didn't lose my temper, but I realized that,

321
00:44:26.50 --> 00:44:30.50
like most civilians, ward this lady, met John Wayne,

322
00:44:30.50 --> 00:44:34.50
or the sweet musical South Pacific.

323
00:44:34.50 --> 00:44:37.50
Slowly placing my hands on the table,

324
00:44:37.50 --> 00:44:40.50
aware that all eyes were upon us.

325
00:44:40.50 --> 00:44:44.50
I said in a loud, calm voice, lady,

326
00:44:44.50 --> 00:44:46.50
there was a killing war.

327
00:44:46.50 --> 00:44:52.50
The Marine Corps taught me how to kill japs and try to survive.

328
00:44:52.50 --> 00:44:55.50
Now, if that don't fit into any academic course,

329
00:44:55.50 --> 00:44:59.50
I'm sorry, but some of us had to do the killing.

330
00:44:59.50 --> 00:45:03.50
And most of my buddies got killed or wounded.

331
00:45:03.50 --> 00:45:08.50
She was speechless.

332
00:45:08.50 --> 00:45:10.50
There were many red faces,

333
00:45:10.50 --> 00:45:14.50
among the obvious non-combatants present.

334
00:45:14.50 --> 00:45:17.50
I doubt if there were half a dozen interim figures

335
00:45:17.50 --> 00:45:20.50
or tankers present.

336
00:45:20.50 --> 00:45:23.50
She recovered her composure, looked me in the eye

337
00:45:23.50 --> 00:45:28.50
and said, I'm so sorry, I apologize, I didn't understand.

338
00:45:28.50 --> 00:45:31.50
I told her, she was very kind and I did not mean to,

339
00:45:31.50 --> 00:45:35.50
I said, you didn't, you didn't, you made me think.

340
00:45:35.50 --> 00:45:41.50
So I got credit for ROTC and PE and the room returned to normal.

341
00:45:41.50 --> 00:45:46.50
The young lady wished me a long and happy life,

342
00:45:46.50 --> 00:45:49.50
I thanked her and left.

343
00:45:49.50 --> 00:45:52.50
I felt like some sort of an alien.

344
00:45:52.50 --> 00:45:55.50
And I realized that this sort of thing would confront me

345
00:45:55.50 --> 00:45:57.50
the rest of my days.

346
00:45:57.50 --> 00:46:00.50
The war had been so momentous to me.

347
00:46:00.50 --> 00:46:03.50
I couldn't imagine anyone not sharing that view

348
00:46:03.50 --> 00:46:07.50
or appreciating the hell I had suffered.

349
00:46:07.50 --> 00:46:12.50
In fact, I was totally unprepared for how rapidly

350
00:46:12.50 --> 00:46:15.50
most Americans who did not experience combat

351
00:46:15.50 --> 00:46:18.50
would forget about the war, the evils we faced

352
00:46:18.50 --> 00:46:21.50
and how incredibly tough it had been for us to defeat

353
00:46:21.50 --> 00:46:24.50
the Japanese and the Nazis.

354
00:46:24.50 --> 00:46:29.50
I didn't realize how swiftly most Americans would once again

355
00:46:29.50 --> 00:46:34.50
take their freedom for granted.

356
00:46:34.50 --> 00:46:41.50
Clearly that applies to veterans and people that have been

357
00:46:41.50 --> 00:46:51.50
overseas fighting and you come back and it's like no one even knows

358
00:46:51.50 --> 00:46:53.50
that you were gone.

359
00:46:53.50 --> 00:46:56.50
It's like another thing, you get that passage of time

360
00:46:56.50 --> 00:46:59.50
when you go away for two or three months

361
00:46:59.50 --> 00:47:01.50
and you go back to where you're from

362
00:47:01.50 --> 00:47:04.50
and it seems like, oh, how long you've been gone for three months?

363
00:47:04.50 --> 00:47:06.50
Oh, it seems like people think you were gone for a couple days

364
00:47:06.50 --> 00:47:07.50
or a couple weeks.

365
00:47:07.50 --> 00:47:08.50
Yeah.

366
00:47:08.50 --> 00:47:09.50
It happens at the gym.

367
00:47:09.50 --> 00:47:13.50
Like I'll go into the gym and someone else, oh, where you been?

368
00:47:13.50 --> 00:47:15.50
You know, I think I haven't seen him in a week

369
00:47:15.50 --> 00:47:17.50
and he says, oh, I tore my ACL.

370
00:47:17.50 --> 00:47:19.50
I've been gone for eight months.

371
00:47:19.50 --> 00:47:21.50
You know, it's one of those moments

372
00:47:21.50 --> 00:47:22.50
and that happens with war, too.

373
00:47:22.50 --> 00:47:23.50
Guys go away.

374
00:47:23.50 --> 00:47:26.50
They come back every time just went by.

375
00:47:26.50 --> 00:47:28.50
And that can be frustrating

376
00:47:28.50 --> 00:47:31.50
because in those eight months or six months or 14 months

377
00:47:31.50 --> 00:47:33.50
that someone's deployed overseas fighting for their lives

378
00:47:33.50 --> 00:47:35.50
and they come home and that other person didn't even notice

379
00:47:35.50 --> 00:47:36.50
they were gone.

380
00:47:36.50 --> 00:47:37.50
Yeah.

381
00:47:37.50 --> 00:47:38.50
I mean, I feel bad when somebody had an ACL tear

382
00:47:38.50 --> 00:47:39.50
and I didn't know it.

383
00:47:39.50 --> 00:47:40.50
You know, I feel kind of bad.

384
00:47:40.50 --> 00:47:41.50
Yeah.

385
00:47:41.50 --> 00:47:42.50
And I haven't seen you for eight months.

386
00:47:42.50 --> 00:47:45.50
You know, I feel like I feel bad about it.

387
00:47:45.50 --> 00:47:48.50
And I'm sure that person's saying, you know,

388
00:47:48.50 --> 00:47:50.50
Jocquajice, we used to train all the time

389
00:47:50.50 --> 00:47:52.50
and you didn't even realize that I was gone.

390
00:47:52.50 --> 00:47:53.50
It was gone for a week.

391
00:47:53.50 --> 00:47:54.50
Right?

392
00:47:54.50 --> 00:47:55.50
Meaning anything.

393
00:47:55.50 --> 00:47:56.50
Kind of a, yeah, exactly.

394
00:47:56.50 --> 00:47:58.50
Well, imagine how that feels to a veteran

395
00:47:58.50 --> 00:48:00.50
that's coming back from war.

396
00:48:00.50 --> 00:48:03.50
And that is, this isn't, this isn't like some odd case.

397
00:48:03.50 --> 00:48:04.50
This is the norm.

398
00:48:04.50 --> 00:48:06.50
That's actually the norm.

399
00:48:06.50 --> 00:48:07.50
Yeah.

400
00:48:07.50 --> 00:48:09.50
I mean, it's different for the direct family.

401
00:48:09.50 --> 00:48:11.50
That's waiting for the individual to come home.

402
00:48:11.50 --> 00:48:14.50
Then those six month deployments or 14 months deployment

403
00:48:14.50 --> 00:48:16.50
seem like an eternity.

404
00:48:16.50 --> 00:48:21.50
But for that casual person or that acquaintance that you don't know that well,

405
00:48:21.50 --> 00:48:24.50
they're thinking, oh, oh, did you, where are you been?

406
00:48:24.50 --> 00:48:25.50
Yeah.

407
00:48:25.50 --> 00:48:26.50
Oh, yeah, I was overseas fighting.

408
00:48:26.50 --> 00:48:27.50
Yeah.

409
00:48:27.50 --> 00:48:36.50
And he's got the way he kind of wraps up this book and is

410
00:48:36.50 --> 00:48:37.50
Epilogue.

411
00:48:37.50 --> 00:48:40.50
And again, you know, this is another book that we'll probably explore at some point in detail.

412
00:48:40.50 --> 00:48:50.50
But going to the way that the topics that he brings up as he closes out and reflections on how the war impacted him.

413
00:48:50.50 --> 00:48:51.50
Psychologically.

414
00:48:51.50 --> 00:48:55.50
Here we go back to the book.

415
00:48:55.50 --> 00:49:04.50
Looking back over the momentous events of 50 years ago, when I was a Marine, he woke strong emotions.

416
00:49:04.50 --> 00:49:08.50
The years immediately after the war were the hardest.

417
00:49:08.50 --> 00:49:15.50
As Paul Fussle remarked, the combat veteran not only has to survive his experience.

418
00:49:15.50 --> 00:49:21.50
He asked to learn to live with it the rest of his life.

419
00:49:21.50 --> 00:49:22.50
He was so right.

420
00:49:22.50 --> 00:49:35.50
For the first 20 odd years after my return, nightmares occurred frequently, waking me either crying or yelling always sweating and with a pounding heart.

421
00:49:35.50 --> 00:49:42.50
Some nights, I delayed going to bed, dreading the inevitable nightmares.

422
00:49:42.50 --> 00:49:57.50
The comrades wrote me that similar troubles drove many of them to drink and to the ensuing misery of alcoholism, which they beat with sheer self-discipline.

423
00:49:57.50 --> 00:50:07.50
Eventually, the war left me with a deep appreciation for the simple things in life.

424
00:50:07.50 --> 00:50:16.50
Putting on a clean pair of dry socks is one of the greatest luxuries I know.

425
00:50:16.50 --> 00:50:24.50
A shave, a warm shower, and sleeping in a sheaded bed are two.

426
00:50:24.50 --> 00:50:29.50
When it is raining, especially on an autumn day, I look out the window at the falling drops.

427
00:50:29.50 --> 00:50:40.50
And my thoughts sometimes drift back to those awful days on Okinawa, snafu and eye bailing out a muddy foxhole with an old helmet, shivering in a torrential cold rain.

428
00:50:40.50 --> 00:50:53.50
And both of us, cringing, as each Japanese shell came screaming into the corpse's true area to explode with a deafening crash.

429
00:50:53.50 --> 00:51:03.50
I quickly bring my mind, the focus of my mind back to the present and thank God it enough to suffer hardship and misery again.

430
00:51:03.50 --> 00:51:11.50
And oh, what a blessing to be relieved of constant terror.

431
00:51:11.50 --> 00:51:15.50
My love of the outdoors restrained the affected by the war.

432
00:51:15.50 --> 00:51:28.50
The way I looked at my surroundings was altered. My view of the outdoors had taken a more analytical perspective of its features as military terrain, likely areas for the placement of various foxholes,

433
00:51:28.50 --> 00:51:42.50
the company's 60mm mortars to cover defilids, the light machine guns, so as to achieve crossfires along the company front fields of fire and possible avenues of enemy attacker ambush.

434
00:51:42.50 --> 00:51:52.50
This change in outlook was intense in the early years home, but I cleared my mind of it by concentrating on plant and animal species present or probable.

435
00:51:52.50 --> 00:52:01.50
But the old combat view of things still creeps in sometimes after more than 50 years.

436
00:52:01.50 --> 00:52:21.50
And that's something that definitely, every guy I know that's been overseas, every guy, everything we look at we see to some kind of military terrain in a city for me, especially it's in the city, because I did most of my combat was urban combat and that's so I'm looking at all the time, not only on the highway, on the buildings when you're sitting around,

437
00:52:21.50 --> 00:52:36.50
you're sitting in a hotel room looking out and the street, everything that you look at, you look at from a combat perspective. Now he was outdoorsman.

438
00:52:36.50 --> 00:52:54.50
And he goes back, he gets back from the war and he's going hunting. And this is the first time that he's gone deer hunting after the war. And he's out hunting with a group of people, but he gets dropped off in one spot by himself.

439
00:52:54.50 --> 00:53:03.50
They have a boat, it's by river, they take a boat, they drop them off alone. And here we go back to the book.

440
00:53:03.50 --> 00:53:14.50
Two beautiful doze appeared, walking briskly through the water as they exited the woods and stopped at the far edge of the pond about 30 yards away.

441
00:53:14.50 --> 00:53:21.50
They kept looking toward the area of the drive and moving their ears to capture every sound possible.

442
00:53:21.50 --> 00:53:30.50
More loud sloshing of water and two doze and a large buck came up to the first doze and stopped. They finally looked in my direction.

443
00:53:30.50 --> 00:53:44.50
I remained still and since the wind was blowing toward me, the deer could not pick up my scent. They stood motion, motionless, staring at me and standing up in the clump of cane.

444
00:53:44.50 --> 00:53:50.50
They seemed more concerned with the bang of the hounds than with me though.

445
00:53:50.50 --> 00:53:58.50
Because of the way I held my rifle, I could see my wristwatch so I timed the action or inaction of the deer.

446
00:53:58.50 --> 00:54:02.50
One of the doze picked up an acorn at the edge of the pond and ate it.

447
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:08.50
The buck was large and had a fine set of antlers, the eight points gleaming in the light.

448
00:54:08.50 --> 00:54:14.50
Slowly I raised my rifle and sited in on his chest.

449
00:54:14.50 --> 00:54:19.50
No. He was too fine to creature to kill.

450
00:54:19.50 --> 00:54:25.50
I had murdered one of his kind that morning, so I did not need to venison.

451
00:54:25.50 --> 00:54:29.50
Slowly I lowered my rifle.

452
00:54:29.50 --> 00:54:33.50
The buck remained motionless, motionless.

453
00:54:33.50 --> 00:54:41.50
His instincts probably told him no shape, such as he saw in the cane was natural.

454
00:54:41.50 --> 00:54:50.50
Deer, like most mammals, have very poor sight except for detecting motion and are primarily colorblind.

455
00:54:50.50 --> 00:54:53.50
For 15 minutes we stared at each other.

456
00:54:53.50 --> 00:55:01.50
A shot in the air would send them springing away into the woods, but a shot would frighten them, which I had no desire to do.

457
00:55:01.50 --> 00:55:09.50
The deer seemed more curious than afraid they kept sniffing the air, which apparently bore no scent of danger.

458
00:55:09.50 --> 00:55:14.50
I had on waterproof boots, but was beginning to get cold.

459
00:55:14.50 --> 00:55:17.50
Finally I needed to move a little.

460
00:55:17.50 --> 00:55:22.50
I knew that as soon as I did they would bolt, so I whistled softly.

461
00:55:22.50 --> 00:55:26.50
Every big ear turned quickly in my direction.

462
00:55:26.50 --> 00:55:35.50
I whistled softly again, all the deer slowly lowered their ears turned, went sloshing on the higher ground and ambled into the woods.

463
00:55:35.50 --> 00:55:39.50
Looking back at me once or twice.

464
00:55:39.50 --> 00:55:44.50
The whole episode is one of my most cherished memories.

465
00:55:44.50 --> 00:55:49.50
When Jim picked me up on the boat he asked if I had seen a deer.

466
00:55:49.50 --> 00:55:53.50
I said no, not wanting to tell him I had seen five.

467
00:55:53.50 --> 00:56:00.50
When we returned to camp several people asked me what I had seen, and I reported a few squirrels and some wood ducks.

468
00:56:00.50 --> 00:56:07.50
If I told those eager hunters what had really happened, they would have elected to throw me in the river.

469
00:56:07.50 --> 00:56:14.50
Gus didn't allow any drinking during hunting hours, so after the guns were all unloaded and put in their cases,

470
00:56:14.50 --> 00:56:18.50
the bottled spirits were brought forth, and the party years all had a ball.

471
00:56:18.50 --> 00:56:27.50
Each of the weary hounds went to the fence yard, jumped up on the raised platforms, and went into the barrel for a nap.

472
00:56:27.50 --> 00:56:37.50
The platform was raised as protection against high water, as well as alligators, which have a special appetite for dog flesh.

473
00:56:37.50 --> 00:56:45.50
We re-cross the river after a while and scattered to our homes.

474
00:56:45.50 --> 00:56:47.50
So ended my last deer hunt.

475
00:56:47.50 --> 00:56:57.50
With the memory of that beautiful buck and his harem down the river. I have wondered how long he survived.

476
00:56:57.50 --> 00:57:02.50
I am not anti-hunting, as long as it is managed by wildlife experts.

477
00:57:02.50 --> 00:57:10.50
Most game animals outproduced their food supply, and since civilization has destroyed most of the natural predators,

478
00:57:10.50 --> 00:57:18.50
starvation results and thus populations are controlled by game management overseeing proper hunting practices.

479
00:57:18.50 --> 00:57:26.50
But the terrified eyes of that spike buck I shot are something I'd like to forget.

480
00:57:26.50 --> 00:57:34.50
I have felt the same terror when being shot at, so hunting is not for me.

481
00:57:34.50 --> 00:57:49.50
World War II gave me a convenient measuring stick for duty, courage, terror, friendship, patience, horror, endurance, compassion, discomfort, grief, and pain.

482
00:57:49.50 --> 00:57:54.50
That has remained with me daily.

483
00:57:54.50 --> 00:58:01.50
The English poet Robert Graves said World War I affected him in much the same way.

484
00:58:01.50 --> 00:58:15.50
Anyone who is not suffered the prolonged fear and limitless fatigue that was combat, that was the combat infantryman's lot, might find this difficult to comprehend.

485
00:58:15.50 --> 00:58:29.50
Over 50 years later, I look back on the war, as though it were some giant killing machine into which we were thrown to endure fear to the brink of insanity.

486
00:58:29.50 --> 00:58:38.50
Some fell over the brink, and physical fatigue to near collapse.

487
00:58:38.50 --> 00:58:54.50
Those who survived, on hurt, will never forget and cannot forget the many friends lost in their prime and the many articles of civilization they ruthlessly destroyed.

488
00:58:54.50 --> 00:58:58.50
As I look back, some facts are quite clear.

489
00:58:58.50 --> 00:59:05.50
Japan's sneak bombing of Pearl Harbor destroyed many American lives, ships, and planes.

490
00:59:05.50 --> 00:59:11.50
We had no choice but to destroy Imperial Japan.

491
00:59:11.50 --> 00:59:14.50
The A-Bomb ended that war.

492
00:59:14.50 --> 00:59:23.50
It saved millions of American lives by preventing a murderous invasion of Japan, and the probable destruction of a suicidal Japanese population.

493
00:59:23.50 --> 00:59:34.50
The Japanese soldier was a bloodthirsty foe in blood with the code of bushydo.

494
00:59:34.50 --> 00:59:47.50
If we had not defeated an army that thought it was unbeatable, who knows how many American cities might have shared the horrid rape of man king.

495
00:59:47.50 --> 00:59:54.50
In looking back, I'm still amazed I escaped the killing machine.

496
00:59:54.50 --> 01:00:03.50
Why I never fell killed or wounded in that storm of steel thrown at us countless times still astonishes me.

497
01:00:03.50 --> 01:00:15.50
I'm proud of the number of the enemy I fired on and hit with my mortar, rifle, or Tommy Gun, and regret the ones I missed.

498
01:00:15.50 --> 01:00:18.50
There is no mellowing for me.

499
01:00:18.50 --> 01:00:26.50
That would be to forgive all the atrocities the Japanese committed against millions of Asians and thousands of Americans.

500
01:00:26.50 --> 01:00:31.50
To mellow is to forget.

501
01:00:31.50 --> 01:00:42.50
Each man who survived, I am certain, was plucked from the mire of death by the Almighty.

502
01:00:42.50 --> 01:00:48.50
And in this, I feel humble and grateful.

503
01:00:48.50 --> 01:00:55.50
Socrates said, no thy self.

504
01:00:55.50 --> 01:00:59.50
I do.

505
01:00:59.50 --> 01:01:13.50
The war taught me.

506
01:01:13.50 --> 01:01:15.50
The war taught me.

507
01:01:15.50 --> 01:01:24.50
This is how he closes out that book and the war taught me as well.

508
01:01:24.50 --> 01:01:32.50
And the war still teaches me.

509
01:01:32.50 --> 01:01:37.50
And that's why I read about war.

510
01:01:37.50 --> 01:01:51.50
And why I talk about war and that's why so much of this podcast is about war because war can teach us.

511
01:01:51.50 --> 01:02:00.50
But it's not only war that teaches us life.

512
01:02:00.50 --> 01:02:05.50
Life teaches us.

513
01:02:05.50 --> 01:02:20.50
But that's only if we are humble and open minded enough and attentive enough to watch, then listen and learn from it.

514
01:02:20.50 --> 01:02:31.50
Not only from our own paths and the things we go through, but from what we see other people do.

515
01:02:31.50 --> 01:02:32.50
It's a teacher.

516
01:02:32.50 --> 01:02:34.50
Life is a teacher.

517
01:02:34.50 --> 01:02:43.50
And yet, and you see this all the time, there are people that do not learn from life.

518
01:02:43.50 --> 01:02:54.50
And they make the same mistakes over and over and over again, just completely unaware of the lessons that are,

519
01:02:54.50 --> 01:03:01.50
that are smacking them in the face, smacking them in the face.

520
01:03:01.50 --> 01:03:09.50
And I think that's where you have to flip the switch in your brain that that hardship,

521
01:03:09.50 --> 01:03:26.50
that you're facing, that trial, that tribulation embedded in that misery is a lesson.

522
01:03:26.50 --> 01:03:29.50
To teach you.

523
01:03:29.50 --> 01:03:38.50
And it's only a lesson if you're willing to learn from it.

524
01:03:38.50 --> 01:03:45.50
You know, your hand life is a hard teacher.

525
01:03:45.50 --> 01:03:58.50
But do your best to listen and to learn from it.

526
01:03:58.50 --> 01:04:11.50
You know, speaking of learning, I last Facebook live got some good questions.

527
01:04:11.50 --> 01:04:14.50
And I do a little rough transition.

528
01:04:14.50 --> 01:04:15.50
No, man.

529
01:04:15.50 --> 01:04:25.50
But it was just kind of going through all those different people's books.

530
01:04:25.50 --> 01:04:28.50
And you can see what war did to them.

531
01:04:28.50 --> 01:04:36.50
And you can see the similarities with all of them that human beings put in really stressful situations.

532
01:04:36.50 --> 01:04:38.50
Human beings put in life.

533
01:04:38.50 --> 01:04:40.50
They have similar outcomes.

534
01:04:40.50 --> 01:04:43.50
I mean, there's commonalities in it.

535
01:04:43.50 --> 01:04:47.50
And I think the more we look for those commonalities in the more individual you, me,

536
01:04:47.50 --> 01:04:52.50
the more I look for these commonalities in different people's experiences, the better off I'm going to be.

537
01:04:52.50 --> 01:04:58.50
Right? The more I'm going to be able to understand what's happening to the world around me or to the people around me.

538
01:04:58.50 --> 01:05:07.50
And that's the one thing that I think is really important is seeing, you know, when you start talking about the life lessons hit you in the face.

539
01:05:07.50 --> 01:05:11.50
It's always, if you're the person that's getting hit.

540
01:05:11.50 --> 01:05:17.50
That's the, even though you're the person that stands to gain the most from from understanding what's going on around you.

541
01:05:17.50 --> 01:05:21.50
You're also the person that has the hardest time recognizing it.

542
01:05:21.50 --> 01:05:26.50
It's just like when you're sitting outside of an MMA match or an MMA fight.

543
01:05:26.50 --> 01:05:31.50
And you as the coach as the cornerman, you can see what's happening.

544
01:05:31.50 --> 01:05:36.50
And the guy that's getting punched in the face, a lot of times they don't see what's hitting them.

545
01:05:36.50 --> 01:05:38.50
And they don't think of it as a lesson.

546
01:05:38.50 --> 01:05:40.50
They don't, they're not taking anything positive away from it.

547
01:05:40.50 --> 01:05:42.50
They're getting punched in the face.

548
01:05:42.50 --> 01:05:46.50
And it's not until someone says, hey, the guy is hitting you with a left hook.

549
01:05:46.50 --> 01:05:50.50
You're, you know, you're, you're dropping your hands or whatever so that the person can make a correction.

550
01:05:50.50 --> 01:05:51.50
They're not learned from it.

551
01:05:51.50 --> 01:05:52.50
They're getting hit.

552
01:05:52.50 --> 01:05:56.50
And that's what happens to a lot of us in life is we're getting punched in the face, punch in the face, punch in the face.

553
01:05:56.50 --> 01:05:59.50
And we don't recognize, we can't step back.

554
01:05:59.50 --> 01:06:05.50
We can't detach from being in that situation where we can actually assess what's going on and say, oh, okay.

555
01:06:05.50 --> 01:06:06.50
I see what's going on here.

556
01:06:06.50 --> 01:06:09.50
I see what I see what changes that got to make.

557
01:06:09.50 --> 01:06:13.50
That's why, and then what happens is, this is what happens.

558
01:06:13.50 --> 01:06:16.50
What happens is you say, oh, echo.

559
01:06:16.50 --> 01:06:18.50
I see you're going through some hard times.

560
01:06:18.50 --> 01:06:21.50
So I go up to you and say, hey, echo, this is what you're doing, this is what you should change.

561
01:06:21.50 --> 01:06:23.50
And what happens big ego flare up from echo.

562
01:06:23.50 --> 01:06:24.50
You don't know how I feel.

563
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:25.50
You don't know how I feel.

564
01:06:25.50 --> 01:06:26.50
You don't know what's going on.

565
01:06:26.50 --> 01:06:27.50
You don't know what it's like.

566
01:06:27.50 --> 01:06:28.50
You don't know what it feels like getting punched in the face.

567
01:06:28.50 --> 01:06:29.50
But I'm just trying to help you.

568
01:06:29.50 --> 01:06:30.50
You don't get it.

569
01:06:30.50 --> 01:06:36.50
So what we do are instinct is to put up defenses, even when somebody's trying to help us out.

570
01:06:36.50 --> 01:06:37.50
Right.

571
01:06:37.50 --> 01:06:42.50
So that means you got to get good at trying to help people out too because we already know that everyone gets defensive.

572
01:06:42.50 --> 01:06:44.50
And that everyone's ego flare up.

573
01:06:44.50 --> 01:06:59.50
And that when you talk to your friend that's either a vet coming home and he's facing problems or someone that's having a hard time at work or someone that's having a hard time relationship or someone that's having a hard time with whatever addiction's gotten a hold of them.

574
01:06:59.50 --> 01:07:06.50
All those things you got to learn how to how to talk to those people in a way that you're not being offensive to them.

575
01:07:06.50 --> 01:07:10.50
Which is hard to do because we all take offense whenever somebody tells us that we're doing something wrong.

576
01:07:10.50 --> 01:07:12.50
We're all offended by it.

577
01:07:12.50 --> 01:07:16.50
Even the most positive, helpful person.

578
01:07:16.50 --> 01:07:18.50
Your own your mom.

579
01:07:18.50 --> 01:07:19.50
Right.

580
01:07:19.50 --> 01:07:22.50
Your mom comes and tell you something you get offended.

581
01:07:22.50 --> 01:07:23.50
You're right.

582
01:07:23.50 --> 01:07:26.50
Your best friend comes and says, hey, you know, you're doing this.

583
01:07:26.50 --> 01:07:28.50
You're going down the wrong path here.

584
01:07:28.50 --> 01:07:30.50
You don't know nothing about my path.

585
01:07:30.50 --> 01:07:31.50
You.

586
01:07:31.50 --> 01:07:38.50
So having that detachment so you can see yourself and then having an open mind when somebody tries to help you.

587
01:07:38.50 --> 01:07:44.50
And then when you are trying to help someone trying to do it in a way that you don't attack their ego.

588
01:07:44.50 --> 01:07:50.50
Those are some good things to think about as you're going through life trying to take lessons away from it.

589
01:07:50.50 --> 01:07:52.50
So crazy.

590
01:07:52.50 --> 01:07:54.50
I apologize again.

591
01:07:54.50 --> 01:07:56.50
I apologize to everything.

592
01:07:56.50 --> 01:07:59.50
You know what's like what you ever hear people say.

593
01:07:59.50 --> 01:08:04.50
If I knew then what I know now, that's the, of course, right?

594
01:08:04.50 --> 01:08:05.50
Of course.

595
01:08:05.50 --> 01:08:11.50
The, the jacked up thing is there's all kinds of people that know now.

596
01:08:11.50 --> 01:08:13.50
That tried to tell you then.

597
01:08:13.50 --> 01:08:13.50
Yeah.

598
01:08:13.50 --> 01:08:16.50
There's so many places to get this information.

599
01:08:16.50 --> 01:08:21.50
You're saying if I knew then what I knew now, well, then guess what?

600
01:08:21.50 --> 01:08:23.50
All kinds of people were trying to help you.

601
01:08:23.50 --> 01:08:23.50
Yeah.

602
01:08:23.50 --> 01:08:24.50
We're trying to help me.

603
01:08:24.50 --> 01:08:25.50
We're trying to tell me what to do.

604
01:08:25.50 --> 01:08:28.50
I wasn't listening to any of my ego is too big.

605
01:08:28.50 --> 01:08:29.50
I know what I'm doing.

606
01:08:29.50 --> 01:08:31.50
I'm the smartest person in the world.

607
01:08:31.50 --> 01:08:32.50
You don't understand the situation.

608
01:08:32.50 --> 01:08:34.50
It's going to be different for me.

609
01:08:34.50 --> 01:08:35.50
My life is special.

610
01:08:35.50 --> 01:08:36.50
My life is different.

611
01:08:36.50 --> 01:08:38.50
You don't get all those things.

612
01:08:38.50 --> 01:08:40.50
All those things that we say.

613
01:08:40.50 --> 01:08:46.50
So if we just had an open mind to listen to what people were trying to tell us.

614
01:08:46.50 --> 01:08:46.50
Yeah.

615
01:08:46.50 --> 01:08:49.50
Or or at a minimum.

616
01:08:49.50 --> 01:08:54.50
Have an open mind to listen to what life was trying to tell us.

617
01:08:54.50 --> 01:08:56.50
Hard.

618
01:08:56.50 --> 01:08:59.50
It's bloody because it's so true.

619
01:08:59.50 --> 01:09:03.50
Like how you, when you, when you say,

620
01:09:03.50 --> 01:09:05.50
if I knew then what I know now.

621
01:09:05.50 --> 01:09:10.50
And you say it, well, back then there was people yelling at you.

622
01:09:10.50 --> 01:09:11.50
Yeah.

623
01:09:11.50 --> 01:09:12.50
Scream your metaphor.

624
01:09:12.50 --> 01:09:15.50
You know, right there, giving you that knowledge.

625
01:09:15.50 --> 01:09:17.50
So you could have known then what you know now.

626
01:09:17.50 --> 01:09:18.50
Kind of think.

627
01:09:18.50 --> 01:09:19.50
Yeah.

628
01:09:19.50 --> 01:09:21.50
Then you got to go one step deeper and go,

629
01:09:21.50 --> 01:09:22.50
Dang.

630
01:09:22.50 --> 01:09:24.50
Well, I should have known then to listen to you guys.

631
01:09:24.50 --> 01:09:26.50
You know, I know to listen to you guys now.

632
01:09:26.50 --> 01:09:27.50
Kind of think.

633
01:09:27.50 --> 01:09:32.50
Man, it's like someone's like this borderline impossible scenario.

634
01:09:32.50 --> 01:09:34.50
It is a hard scenario.

635
01:09:34.50 --> 01:09:36.50
There's some things in life.

636
01:09:36.50 --> 01:09:41.50
And this is so unfortunate that you have to learn only from life.

637
01:09:41.50 --> 01:09:45.50
It's all these stupid things that people go through.

638
01:09:45.50 --> 01:09:48.50
And you just, you just, you watch them go through it.

639
01:09:48.50 --> 01:09:49.50
Yeah.

640
01:09:49.50 --> 01:09:55.50
And again, I talk about this story where you, you, you, you, you get someone that's going down a downward spiral.

641
01:09:55.50 --> 01:09:57.50
You pick the downward spiral that they're on.

642
01:09:57.50 --> 01:09:58.50
Yeah.

643
01:09:58.50 --> 01:10:01.50
Whether it's their relationship that they're in as a disaster.

644
01:10:01.50 --> 01:10:05.50
Whether they're getting addicted to whatever you want to get addicted to.

645
01:10:05.50 --> 01:10:06.50
Yeah.

646
01:10:06.50 --> 01:10:11.50
You know, whether that's work, whether that's alcohol, whether that's drugs,

647
01:10:11.50 --> 01:10:14.50
whether that's gambling, whatever thing you want to be addicted to.

648
01:10:14.50 --> 01:10:17.50
You pick the downward spiral that you want to jump on.

649
01:10:17.50 --> 01:10:19.50
The person that's on that downward spiral.

650
01:10:19.50 --> 01:10:21.50
They don't see it.

651
01:10:21.50 --> 01:10:27.50
And everybody that's outside of the spiral can absolutely identify it and tell them.

652
01:10:27.50 --> 01:10:29.50
And they don't want to get off.

653
01:10:29.50 --> 01:10:30.50
Yeah.

654
01:10:30.50 --> 01:10:33.50
I know, hey, addictions are horrible, right?

655
01:10:33.50 --> 01:10:35.50
And that's why they're called addictions.

656
01:10:35.50 --> 01:10:38.50
And that's why people ride that downward spiral until it destroys them.

657
01:10:38.50 --> 01:10:39.50
Yeah.

658
01:10:39.50 --> 01:10:41.50
Like Eugene's sledges dad talked about.

659
01:10:41.50 --> 01:10:43.50
It's like, hey, it'll ruin you.

660
01:10:43.50 --> 01:10:44.50
Yeah.

661
01:10:44.50 --> 01:10:45.50
The only way out is will power.

662
01:10:45.50 --> 01:10:46.50
The only way out.

663
01:10:46.50 --> 01:10:49.50
And then Eugene says, if you've got to defeat it with pure self-discipline.

664
01:10:49.50 --> 01:10:50.50
Yeah.

665
01:10:50.50 --> 01:10:51.50
Yeah.

666
01:10:51.50 --> 01:10:56.50
You can, you can have fun little games with your mind and win.

667
01:10:56.50 --> 01:11:00.50
That's their little chess matches with your mind with alcohol.

668
01:11:00.50 --> 01:11:02.50
I know that from experience.

669
01:11:02.50 --> 01:11:09.50
And when we first started doing the podcast, I didn't realize that you drank as much as you drank at that time.

670
01:11:09.50 --> 01:11:10.50
Yeah.

671
01:11:10.50 --> 01:11:13.50
I was like, because we were recording.

672
01:11:13.50 --> 01:11:14.50
Yeah.

673
01:11:14.50 --> 01:11:15.50
And you poured one out.

674
01:11:15.50 --> 01:11:16.50
And I was like, what are you doing?

675
01:11:16.50 --> 01:11:18.50
I'm like in here to, you know, get after it.

676
01:11:18.50 --> 01:11:21.50
And you're going to have a drink during this?

677
01:11:21.50 --> 01:11:22.50
Yeah.

678
01:11:22.50 --> 01:11:25.50
Well, in my slight defense.

679
01:11:25.50 --> 01:11:29.50
One drink wouldn't really affect anything.

680
01:11:29.50 --> 01:11:38.50
And I know this because other people tell me this and I feel this where even if I'll get hammered this back then, you couldn't really tell that people would be like,

681
01:11:38.50 --> 01:11:41.50
oh, you don't even seem at all mean on the inside.

682
01:11:41.50 --> 01:11:43.50
But yeah.

683
01:11:43.50 --> 01:11:45.50
And here's another thing.

684
01:11:45.50 --> 01:11:47.50
And this can apply to a lot of people.

685
01:11:47.50 --> 01:11:54.50
I think not everybody, but maybe some people were wearing, you know, how I was a kind of where I would only drink at home when I did work.

686
01:11:54.50 --> 01:11:56.50
I used to think that I worked with bizarre things.

687
01:11:56.50 --> 01:11:57.50
Yeah.

688
01:11:57.50 --> 01:11:59.50
When I looked at the textbook definition of an alcoholic,

689
01:11:59.50 --> 01:12:02.50
drinking at home alone while you're working.

690
01:12:02.50 --> 01:12:07.50
No, I'm sure it's one of the potential symptoms, but straight up not potential.

691
01:12:07.50 --> 01:12:10.50
When I went to like the bar or something like hang out,

692
01:12:10.50 --> 01:12:11.50
I didn't really go to the club.

693
01:12:11.50 --> 01:12:14.50
I mean, after I stopped working with clubbing or doing it.

694
01:12:14.50 --> 01:12:19.50
But, you know, to go hang out and stuff, I drink way less.

695
01:12:19.50 --> 01:12:21.50
I wouldn't even really want to drink that much.

696
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:27.50
I don't want to go work, and that's what I would drink, but like I said, I work every single night and for a long time too.

697
01:12:27.50 --> 01:12:30.50
So, it was like every night for like years and years.

698
01:12:30.50 --> 01:12:35.50
But the only problem that it would kind of create were these kind of covert problems.

699
01:12:35.50 --> 01:12:38.50
Like the next day I wasn't as driven to do much.

700
01:12:38.50 --> 01:12:43.50
I'd work out, go train, I do all the stuff that I've been doing for whatever years.

701
01:12:43.50 --> 01:12:48.50
But, you know, like how you learn something new to bring, you know,

702
01:12:48.50 --> 01:12:52.50
XYZ element of your life to the next level kind of thing.

703
01:12:52.50 --> 01:12:54.50
It would really get in the way of that.

704
01:12:54.50 --> 01:12:57.50
So, so you're kind of staying at level like three.

705
01:12:57.50 --> 01:13:01.50
Yeah, but here's the thing, in certain ways, I was learning a lot because you learn a lot.

706
01:13:01.50 --> 01:13:07.50
When I work and stuff, when I do, you know, all these programs and do video stuff, you learn a lot while you do it.

707
01:13:07.50 --> 01:13:10.50
So, man, I was learning and getting better and my stuff.

708
01:13:10.50 --> 01:13:13.50
So, in a way, the problems, like I said, weren't real obvious.

709
01:13:13.50 --> 01:13:19.50
And then after a while, like, after time goes, you know what it was? What really brought the problems to light was for the hang with you.

710
01:13:19.50 --> 01:13:22.50
Because you'd be like, okay, we're here. Now we're going here.

711
01:13:22.50 --> 01:13:25.50
To this week, we're on like a whole different thing.

712
01:13:25.50 --> 01:13:27.50
And I'm like, man, I can hardly keep up with Jocco.

713
01:13:27.50 --> 01:13:33.50
So, at night, I'd be like, oh, yeah, I'm keeping up with Jocco, but the next is them thinking when you're doing stuff early in the morning.

714
01:13:33.50 --> 01:13:37.50
You're doing stuff during the day. You're letting me know, okay, now we got this and I'm like,

715
01:13:37.50 --> 01:13:39.50
Dang, I just basically've been recovering all day.

716
01:13:39.50 --> 01:13:42.50
Because I don't feel that good. I didn't work out.

717
01:13:42.50 --> 01:13:46.50
So, yeah, as we used to record the podcast at night, you just laid it night.

718
01:13:46.50 --> 01:13:48.50
And so we'd get down at one o'clock in the morning.

719
01:13:48.50 --> 01:13:52.50
Yeah. And yeah, I'd have to get after it in the morning and you'd not have to.

720
01:13:52.50 --> 01:13:55.50
Yeah, exactly. Right. So, it's weird.

721
01:13:55.50 --> 01:13:58.50
When you do that routine, you get this weird second.

722
01:13:58.50 --> 01:14:02.50
I think your body just gets ready to do work and stuff.

723
01:14:02.50 --> 01:14:04.50
You know how you do something over and over your body.

724
01:14:04.50 --> 01:14:06.50
You just kind of just accommodate the schedule.

725
01:14:06.50 --> 01:14:10.50
So, I was like, at night, I do fine, but during the day, I want to do nothing.

726
01:14:10.50 --> 01:14:13.50
Meanwhile, you're, you know, doing all this stuff and I was like, man,

727
01:14:13.50 --> 01:14:15.50
I did not mention all the things that we talked about.

728
01:14:15.50 --> 01:14:18.50
Yeah. I was like, oh, I got tricked by my brain.

729
01:14:18.50 --> 01:14:22.50
Meanwhile, at the expense of my whole life, aside from those, you know,

730
01:14:22.50 --> 01:14:25.50
for the other things that sucks for you is that because you were kind of,

731
01:14:25.50 --> 01:14:27.50
because the problems were covert.

732
01:14:27.50 --> 01:14:33.50
There wasn't any, I'm assuming that there wasn't any external people trying to help you

733
01:14:33.50 --> 01:14:35.50
and be like, hey, I go, you shouldn't drink at night.

734
01:14:35.50 --> 01:14:39.50
Because you were still maintaining an acceptable standard of humanity.

735
01:14:39.50 --> 01:14:43.50
So, and you, you're taking care of your wife, you're taking care of your young daughter.

736
01:14:43.50 --> 01:14:46.50
And so you're doing what you're responsible to do.

737
01:14:46.50 --> 01:14:49.50
What your responsibilities are, we're being handled.

738
01:14:49.50 --> 01:14:51.50
They're just being handled at level three and level three was, okay,

739
01:14:51.50 --> 01:14:54.50
maybe people thought that was where you were at, you know?

740
01:14:54.50 --> 01:14:57.50
Actually, in this may sound better, but this is worse.

741
01:14:57.50 --> 01:15:01.50
They were being held, at level essentially level ten.

742
01:15:01.50 --> 01:15:05.50
Everything like, I care, everything I cared about was being handled.

743
01:15:05.50 --> 01:15:11.50
Everything like to the really high level, like hanging with the kids, talking with them.

744
01:15:11.50 --> 01:15:14.50
So my wife would go to bed earlier than me.

745
01:15:14.50 --> 01:15:16.50
So then you'd say, like, working.

746
01:15:16.50 --> 01:15:18.50
Working, drinking, I could still wake up.

747
01:15:18.50 --> 01:15:23.50
I'd be messed, you know, not that, like, happy to be awake,

748
01:15:23.50 --> 01:15:27.50
but without one in every, that would never show dealing with other people.

749
01:15:27.50 --> 01:15:30.50
And then there would be times where I feel, if I was just too,

750
01:15:30.50 --> 01:15:32.50
and really just, I just felt tired. That's what it was.

751
01:15:32.50 --> 01:15:33.50
I didn't feel hung over.

752
01:15:33.50 --> 01:15:35.50
You know, this is actually brings up a good point.

753
01:15:35.50 --> 01:15:38.50
Is that I think a lot of times people spend,

754
01:15:38.50 --> 01:15:42.50
because they're, because they're achieving a minimum standard,

755
01:15:42.50 --> 01:15:47.50
or maybe even a medium standard, or a solid standard in your case,

756
01:15:47.50 --> 01:15:50.50
from your perspective.

757
01:15:50.50 --> 01:15:53.50
To me was, I was working.

758
01:15:53.50 --> 01:15:55.50
Yeah, you're working, you're getting your job done.

759
01:15:55.50 --> 01:16:01.50
Yeah, making, making your family, and doing workouts, like hard, good workouts during the day.

760
01:16:01.50 --> 01:16:04.50
But everything else tells, like, oh, my post.

761
01:16:04.50 --> 01:16:05.50
I can't do this.

762
01:16:05.50 --> 01:16:12.50
But I bet there's always, so basically, if you're not looking at yourself with a critical eye,

763
01:16:12.50 --> 01:16:15.50
you can get by with a lot as a person, as a human being.

764
01:16:15.50 --> 01:16:19.50
If you're not looking, if you're not looking at yourself with a critical eye,

765
01:16:19.50 --> 01:16:22.50
you are going to get, you're not going to reach your potential.

766
01:16:22.50 --> 01:16:26.50
Because you're not going to push yourself as hard as you possibly can,

767
01:16:26.50 --> 01:16:29.50
which is, you know, the MMA fighters.

768
01:16:29.50 --> 01:16:32.50
When I was training a lot of MMA fighters, I would tell them, listen,

769
01:16:32.50 --> 01:16:40.50
you can train without a coach, and you can train to, let's, let's say you're super disciplined.

770
01:16:40.50 --> 01:16:43.50
You can get to, like, 84%.

771
01:16:43.50 --> 01:16:45.50
This is an interesting dichotomy.

772
01:16:45.50 --> 01:16:50.50
You can get to 84% of your max output of your pushing yourself.

773
01:16:50.50 --> 01:16:54.50
A coach is then going to take you to the next level,

774
01:16:54.50 --> 01:16:57.50
and he's going to get you to 98%.

775
01:16:57.50 --> 01:16:59.50
But this is what's interesting.

776
01:16:59.50 --> 01:17:03.50
The last 2% goes back on the individual.

777
01:17:03.50 --> 01:17:07.50
So let's say I'm training you for jujitsu tournament.

778
01:17:07.50 --> 01:17:12.50
If you just trained yourself for the jujitsu tournament, you'd get to 82% of your potential.

779
01:17:12.50 --> 01:17:16.50
Because that means, because you get to the last round, and you look at your,

780
01:17:16.50 --> 01:17:19.50
you know, what I'm probably, I might get hurt this round, so I take it off for.

781
01:17:19.50 --> 01:17:21.50
You know, you're going to make all those excuses.

782
01:17:21.50 --> 01:17:23.50
You're not going to hold the line, right?

783
01:17:23.50 --> 01:17:26.50
Now, if I'm training you, now we're going, okay, okay, okay,

784
01:17:26.50 --> 01:17:27.50
you got to be here.

785
01:17:27.50 --> 01:17:29.50
Yep, echoing, you're going to do two more rounds.

786
01:17:29.50 --> 01:17:30.50
Hey, you're done with your rounds.

787
01:17:30.50 --> 01:17:31.50
You're going to do some burpees.

788
01:17:31.50 --> 01:17:32.50
You know, I'm going to make you do that stuff.

789
01:17:32.50 --> 01:17:34.50
So that's what a coach does.

790
01:17:34.50 --> 01:17:37.50
But then you take the last, that's going to get you to 98%.

791
01:17:37.50 --> 01:17:45.50
But the last 2% is back to you because I can't make you do the burpees.

792
01:17:45.50 --> 01:17:46.50
As hard as you can.

793
01:17:46.50 --> 01:17:50.50
I can make you do them, but I can't make you do them as hard as you can.

794
01:17:50.50 --> 01:17:54.50
I can't, I can make you do another round on the mat,

795
01:17:54.50 --> 01:17:57.50
but I can't make you do it as hard as you can.

796
01:17:57.50 --> 01:18:03.50
I can't make you try moves that you don't feel like trying.

797
01:18:03.50 --> 01:18:04.50
Yeah.

798
01:18:04.50 --> 01:18:08.50
So it takes a little teamwork in those situations.

799
01:18:08.50 --> 01:18:09.50
Yeah.

800
01:18:09.50 --> 01:18:16.50
And that's something I definitely saw with MMA fighters is, yeah, without a coach,

801
01:18:16.50 --> 01:18:18.50
they're not going to push themselves hard.

802
01:18:18.50 --> 01:18:19.50
Yeah.

803
01:18:19.50 --> 01:18:20.50
With a coach, they'll push themselves harder.

804
01:18:20.50 --> 01:18:23.50
But if you're going to be a champion, you got to get that last 2% yourself.

805
01:18:23.50 --> 01:18:24.50
Yeah.

806
01:18:24.50 --> 01:18:29.50
And what's crazy is you can kind of make someone your coach even if they don't know it.

807
01:18:29.50 --> 01:18:36.50
You know how like, where, I mean, I think you'd kind of know that you're kind of the coach,

808
01:18:36.50 --> 01:18:40.50
you know, as far as, because your coach is probably anyone who interacts with you and

809
01:18:40.50 --> 01:18:44.50
you're in a regular basis, they're going to kind of, at the very least look at you and

810
01:18:44.50 --> 01:18:48.50
know that you wake up early and get a lot done for a reason, by the way.

811
01:18:48.50 --> 01:18:49.50
So they know that.

812
01:18:49.50 --> 01:18:52.50
So it's kind of like, okay, I can follow suit.

813
01:18:52.50 --> 01:18:56.50
You know, I can take cues from Jocco in this way and I can improve it.

814
01:18:56.50 --> 01:19:01.50
Doesn't have to be in the exact things that you're doing, but just in stuff that they do.

815
01:19:01.50 --> 01:19:08.50
So I think if you actively do that, where, I mean, I'm speaking from a place of supreme luxury,

816
01:19:08.50 --> 01:19:13.50
by the way, in regards to this, where, you know, I'm like, you're talking about it directly to me every single week.

817
01:19:13.50 --> 01:19:18.50
And I'm like, yes, sir, and I go back and try, you know, trying to best so-play to my stuff.

818
01:19:18.50 --> 01:19:26.50
Of course, but you can do that even if you watch someone on, I don't know, online or something or you read it.

819
01:19:26.50 --> 01:19:33.50
You know how people do like blogs and stuff like that, you know, if you're like a subscriber to a specific blog and you really like,

820
01:19:33.50 --> 01:19:41.50
you know, to the way they do things or whatever, you can, you can get that same effect in a smaller way, I think.

821
01:19:41.50 --> 01:19:46.50
But you can definitely, but you just, you gotta be like conscious of it, though,

822
01:19:46.50 --> 01:19:52.50
and how you say like, you have to have your own self, like, it's self-discipline for sure, but what did you say?

823
01:19:52.50 --> 01:19:54.50
You just said it.

824
01:19:54.50 --> 01:19:55.50
Self-awareness.

825
01:19:55.50 --> 01:19:57.50
Look at yourself with a critical eye.

826
01:19:57.50 --> 01:19:58.50
Yeah.

827
01:19:58.50 --> 01:20:00.50
You gotta do that, and here's the opposite of that.

828
01:20:00.50 --> 01:20:07.50
In my opinion, and from what I've seen, the enemy of looking at yourself with a critical eye is being good at justifying stuff.

829
01:20:07.50 --> 01:20:08.50
Yeah.

830
01:20:08.50 --> 01:20:14.50
Especially, you know, I can hardly say smart people are dangerous in that way, but they're really good at justifying things.

831
01:20:14.50 --> 01:20:18.50
Because yeah, rationalizing something and justifying something is exactly what it is.

832
01:20:18.50 --> 01:20:20.50
It is exactly what that says.

833
01:20:20.50 --> 01:20:21.50
It's justifying it.

834
01:20:21.50 --> 01:20:22.50
Yeah.

835
01:20:22.50 --> 01:20:25.50
Are you justified in XYZ and if you are, you are.

836
01:20:25.50 --> 01:20:29.50
So if you can justify something to yourself and you're good at it, it's okay.

837
01:20:29.50 --> 01:20:31.50
In your mind is literally okay.

838
01:20:31.50 --> 01:20:33.50
It's not a good situation, but it's very dangerous.

839
01:20:33.50 --> 01:20:34.50
It's a very dangerous.

840
01:20:34.50 --> 01:20:35.50
Critical eye.

841
01:20:35.50 --> 01:20:35.50
Yeah.

842
01:20:35.50 --> 01:20:36.50
That's the critical eye.

843
01:20:36.50 --> 01:20:37.50
That's a good eye.

844
01:20:37.50 --> 01:20:38.50
Call yourself out.

845
01:20:38.50 --> 01:20:39.50
Yeah.

846
01:20:39.50 --> 01:20:43.50
If you want to reach your maximum potential and move from level three.

847
01:20:43.50 --> 01:20:44.50
Yeah.

848
01:20:44.50 --> 01:20:45.50
To at least level eight.

849
01:20:45.50 --> 01:20:46.50
Yeah.

850
01:20:46.50 --> 01:20:47.50
Man.

851
01:20:47.50 --> 01:20:54.50
So what I was saying is that got some pretty good little rapid fire questions.

852
01:20:54.50 --> 01:21:00.50
You know, I didn't want to take a bunch of time on them, but I just want to at least address some of the questions that came on the Facebooky live.

853
01:21:00.50 --> 01:21:01.50
Sure.

854
01:21:01.50 --> 01:21:10.50
I've got a stack of questions that have been coming in on Facebook and Twitter and those two primarily.

855
01:21:10.50 --> 01:21:14.50
Sure.

856
01:21:14.50 --> 01:21:16.50
Is where the big questions come into.

857
01:21:16.50 --> 01:21:18.50
And I've got to stack those that we'll get around to in a Q&A at some point.

858
01:21:18.50 --> 01:21:21.50
And also a lot of questions that get asked right now.

859
01:21:21.50 --> 01:21:23.50
Heard them before.

860
01:21:23.50 --> 01:21:30.50
So if you have a question, if you haven't listened to the podcast at this point, you might want to just go back and listen to the podcast.

861
01:21:30.50 --> 01:21:39.50
Because the question that you have about how many hours are sleep at night and what time are going to go to bed and you know those kind of things.

862
01:21:39.50 --> 01:21:41.50
They're in the podcast and you don't.

863
01:21:41.50 --> 01:21:44.50
I'm not going to talk about them too much anymore.

864
01:21:44.50 --> 01:21:47.50
You can have like a, you're watching Jeff Pretty.

865
01:21:47.50 --> 01:21:55.50
There would have been something cool about stopping the podcast at number 25 and said that's it.

866
01:21:55.50 --> 01:22:03.50
So you get and just because we addressed a bunch of stuff and then just let it marinate for a while.

867
01:22:03.50 --> 01:22:05.50
Like that would be season one.

868
01:22:05.50 --> 01:22:06.50
You know how they do that.

869
01:22:06.50 --> 01:22:21.50
That's a good idea. Yeah, we should have done that. We should have done season one and then paused and let people really have marinated that first season and then season two comes and boom.

870
01:22:21.50 --> 01:22:23.50
See, I like that.

871
01:22:23.50 --> 01:22:26.50
You wouldn't, you wouldn't never let that happen.

872
01:22:26.50 --> 01:22:27.50
That's what I think.

873
01:22:27.50 --> 01:22:30.50
Well, it depends because it strategically, it's a good idea.

874
01:22:30.50 --> 01:22:33.50
It's a strategically good idea.

875
01:22:33.50 --> 01:22:46.50
Yeah, I think it is because also you're going to let that stuff marinate and then you're going to get good feedback on a bulk of work that people can then say, hey, this was a good area of topics that you discussed.

876
01:22:46.50 --> 01:22:50.50
Please read dress and hit the following concerns.

877
01:22:50.50 --> 01:22:51.50
Right, right.

878
01:22:51.50 --> 01:22:54.50
And so we could attack those those concerns in such a manner.

879
01:22:54.50 --> 01:22:56.50
Yeah, I guess that's one way.

880
01:22:56.50 --> 01:23:02.50
Here, let me, I think this is, I'm speaking selfishly here.

881
01:23:02.50 --> 01:23:16.50
I think this is a big deal where even if you repeat yourself, even if you answer the same question, literally the same question over and over again, it's like, you know when you go to school or college or whatever.

882
01:23:16.50 --> 01:23:18.50
Yeah, and you get a review every week.

883
01:23:18.50 --> 01:23:19.50
Yeah, I think that.

884
01:23:19.50 --> 01:23:20.50
Yeah, it is.

885
01:23:20.50 --> 01:23:22.50
And you just do the best example for me is, do you just do this?

886
01:23:22.50 --> 01:23:25.50
I never, I never absorb a move in the first try.

887
01:23:25.50 --> 01:23:27.50
Yeah, you got to give, you got to teach me 12 different times.

888
01:23:27.50 --> 01:23:30.50
I learned one 12 foot video each time.

889
01:23:30.50 --> 01:23:32.50
Yeah, and then 12 times later, I know all move.

890
01:23:32.50 --> 01:23:33.50
Perfect analogy.

891
01:23:33.50 --> 01:23:34.50
Yeah.

892
01:23:34.50 --> 01:23:39.50
If you, if you, jockels telling echo, yeah, hey, don't complain, like don't complain, problems all.

893
01:23:39.50 --> 01:23:43.50
Don't, who cares about how you feel care about the objective kind of thing.

894
01:23:43.50 --> 01:23:43.50
Yeah.

895
01:23:43.50 --> 01:23:45.50
You told me that one time even two times.

896
01:23:45.50 --> 01:23:47.50
I'm be like, cool, that sounds dope.

897
01:23:47.50 --> 01:23:49.50
Man, I need to do that.

898
01:23:49.50 --> 01:23:49.50
Yeah.

899
01:23:49.50 --> 01:23:54.50
And then next week, next month, six months later, do you think that's sticking with me?

900
01:23:54.50 --> 01:23:59.50
Maybe resonated with me, maybe not, but no, but if you, yeah, if you're saying it every week to the point where it's,

901
01:23:59.50 --> 01:24:00.50
like, I don't even hear your words.

902
01:24:00.50 --> 01:24:03.50
I just know it as, as the concept is just in there.

903
01:24:03.50 --> 01:24:08.50
That's when like, when I hear people complaining, that's a big red flag violation.

904
01:24:08.50 --> 01:24:10.50
Just sticks out like a sore thumb.

905
01:24:10.50 --> 01:24:12.50
So I'll see someone blaming someone.

906
01:24:12.50 --> 01:24:14.50
That's the reason it sticks out because.

907
01:24:14.50 --> 01:24:18.50
So back to this idea of having different seasons.

908
01:24:18.50 --> 01:24:23.50
If it was season one, people would, the recommendations are go back and listen to them all again.

909
01:24:23.50 --> 01:24:26.50
So you'd get reiterated on the exact points.

910
01:24:26.50 --> 01:24:27.50
Yeah.

911
01:24:27.50 --> 01:24:30.50
That's good in theory, but it doesn't work.

912
01:24:30.50 --> 01:24:31.50
I think, I don't know.

913
01:24:31.50 --> 01:24:32.50
That's a, I don't know.

914
01:24:32.50 --> 01:24:33.50
Maybe we could 100.

915
01:24:33.50 --> 01:24:35.50
And then we do, that season one.

916
01:24:35.50 --> 01:24:38.50
Season one is two straight years of podcasts.

917
01:24:38.50 --> 01:24:39.50
Yeah.

918
01:24:39.50 --> 01:24:40.50
Yeah, that could work.

919
01:24:40.50 --> 01:24:42.50
Because you know how?

920
01:24:42.50 --> 01:24:44.50
Because this, the concept you need to see.

921
01:24:44.50 --> 01:24:47.50
And then we take one week off and then we start season two.

922
01:24:47.50 --> 01:24:49.50
Oh, he cut it.

923
01:24:49.50 --> 01:24:51.50
I don't know.

924
01:24:51.50 --> 01:24:54.50
Anyway, I like the way you've been doing it.

925
01:24:54.50 --> 01:24:56.50
To be honest, this is my input.

926
01:24:56.50 --> 01:24:57.50
One guy.

927
01:24:57.50 --> 01:24:58.50
This is my input.

928
01:24:58.50 --> 01:25:01.50
Well, you do have 50% of the vote here.

929
01:25:01.50 --> 01:25:02.50
Apparently.

930
01:25:02.50 --> 01:25:03.50
All right.

931
01:25:03.50 --> 01:25:06.50
Well, let's get to these questions.

932
01:25:06.50 --> 01:25:07.50
Yeah.

933
01:25:07.50 --> 01:25:09.50
Like I said, these are quite questions.

934
01:25:09.50 --> 01:25:10.50
Yeah.

935
01:25:10.50 --> 01:25:11.50
These are like, yeah.

936
01:25:11.50 --> 01:25:12.50
I like them, no.

937
01:25:12.50 --> 01:25:13.50
Mm-hmm.

938
01:25:13.50 --> 01:25:14.50
Okay.

939
01:25:14.50 --> 01:25:15.50
First question.

940
01:25:15.50 --> 01:25:17.50
I'm going to read these just how they're listed.

941
01:25:17.50 --> 01:25:18.50
Yeah.

942
01:25:18.50 --> 01:25:22.50
Then we'll go to, you know, slimming and or running for BJJ conditioning.

943
01:25:22.50 --> 01:25:23.50
Question mark.

944
01:25:23.50 --> 01:25:24.50
Yes.

945
01:25:24.50 --> 01:25:25.50
Swimming and running are good for conditioning.

946
01:25:25.50 --> 01:25:32.50
I would recommend that you use sprints slash interval training for both.

947
01:25:32.50 --> 01:25:35.50
And I think that's going to get you where you want to be.

948
01:25:35.50 --> 01:25:38.50
Also, it's good to have that good base cardio.

949
01:25:38.50 --> 01:25:39.50
Yeah.

950
01:25:39.50 --> 01:25:41.50
So that's good too.

951
01:25:41.50 --> 01:25:43.50
But yeah, they're both good.

952
01:25:43.50 --> 01:25:46.50
The best conditioning for DJ2, DJ2.

953
01:25:46.50 --> 01:25:53.50
The shortfall of that is that you can sometimes push, you never mind.

954
01:25:53.50 --> 01:25:59.50
You can push yourself harder in with burpees or with some kind of met con or swimming or running.

955
01:25:59.50 --> 01:26:01.50
You know, if you go to sprints, you should be breathing.

956
01:26:01.50 --> 01:26:06.50
You should be able to make yourself breathe, harder doing sprints than you can.

957
01:26:06.50 --> 01:26:10.50
Doing rounds of DJ2 for conditioning.

958
01:26:10.50 --> 01:26:11.50
Yeah.

959
01:26:11.50 --> 01:26:14.50
Now the rounds of conditioning, in DJ2 are more important.

960
01:26:14.50 --> 01:26:18.50
But if you want to push yourself extra hard, you got to do something else.

961
01:26:18.50 --> 01:26:19.50
Yes.

962
01:26:19.50 --> 01:26:21.50
So swimming and running for DJ2 conditioning, yes, they're good.

963
01:26:21.50 --> 01:26:22.50
Yes.

964
01:26:22.50 --> 01:26:23.50
Sprints.

965
01:26:23.50 --> 01:26:24.50
Yeah.

966
01:26:24.50 --> 01:26:25.50
And I agree.

967
01:26:25.50 --> 01:26:27.50
Obviously, as far as DJ2, I just learned this.

968
01:26:27.50 --> 01:26:28.50
And I watched it.

969
01:26:28.50 --> 01:26:35.50
It was on a Marcelo Garcia video randomly on a no where he was like, okay, I don't do any other external exercise.

970
01:26:35.50 --> 01:26:37.50
Well, for conditioning, whatever for DJ2.

971
01:26:37.50 --> 01:26:38.50
I used DJ2, so it's conditioning.

972
01:26:38.50 --> 01:26:41.50
But I don't just do regular DJ2.

973
01:26:41.50 --> 01:26:42.50
This is how I do it.

974
01:26:42.50 --> 01:26:43.50
And he demonstrated it.

975
01:26:43.50 --> 01:26:48.50
And he was going against, he's obviously a high, high, the highest level of black belt.

976
01:26:48.50 --> 01:26:49.50
So he grabs a guy.

977
01:26:49.50 --> 01:26:52.50
And the guy is blue belt, I think.

978
01:26:52.50 --> 01:26:54.50
And he's like, okay, this is how you do it for conditioning.

979
01:26:54.50 --> 01:26:55.50
He's like, go, we're going to fight.

980
01:26:55.50 --> 01:26:57.50
We're going to blow for whatever.

981
01:26:57.50 --> 01:26:59.50
How many minutes they go.

982
01:26:59.50 --> 01:27:01.50
And he's like, boom, boom, boom, he's got one move.

983
01:27:01.50 --> 01:27:02.50
Next move, move.

984
01:27:02.50 --> 01:27:04.50
He's just going, all of he's not even finishing moves.

985
01:27:04.50 --> 01:27:05.50
He's going to the next one.

986
01:27:05.50 --> 01:27:06.50
Then he'll finish, then he'll start again.

987
01:27:06.50 --> 01:27:08.50
And he's going, you could tell he's going hard.

988
01:27:08.50 --> 01:27:12.50
He's essentially going as hard as he would if he had only 30 seconds.

989
01:27:12.50 --> 01:27:15.50
45 seconds left on a high level competition.

990
01:27:15.50 --> 01:27:17.50
That's how hard and fast he's going.

991
01:27:17.50 --> 01:27:25.50
And he's like, okay, any explains, you're just, you're just, your focus is going from move to move as fast and as hard as you can.

992
01:27:25.50 --> 01:27:26.50
And you're breathing it all this stuff.

993
01:27:26.50 --> 01:27:28.50
And that's how you get conditioning with your judo.

994
01:27:28.50 --> 01:27:31.50
And I was like, dang man, that's good because think about it.

995
01:27:31.50 --> 01:27:36.50
Just like how you said when you, at least so you have six rounds to go in regular judo training.

996
01:27:36.50 --> 01:27:43.50
Six, it's so, you're just focusing on doing your judo and with judo is energy conservation.

997
01:27:43.50 --> 01:27:46.50
All these things that are anti-conditioning really are.

998
01:27:46.50 --> 01:27:48.50
So you can get into good spots.

999
01:27:48.50 --> 01:27:52.50
Let me check out one step even more granularly.

1000
01:27:52.50 --> 01:27:56.50
If you take six rounds, the last 30 seconds of each round.

1001
01:27:56.50 --> 01:28:03.50
It's, and I talked to Taylor and Andy about this and I said, hey guys, when we get to the last 30 seconds,

1002
01:28:03.50 --> 01:28:06.50
there should be no cruising allowed at all.

1003
01:28:06.50 --> 01:28:07.50
You should be going for the finish.

1004
01:28:07.50 --> 01:28:09.50
And you should be going for the finish.

1005
01:28:09.50 --> 01:28:12.50
Like if you got 30 seconds left, go for the finish.

1006
01:28:12.50 --> 01:28:15.50
If you got 30 seconds after your no bad position, go for the escape as hard as you can.

1007
01:28:15.50 --> 01:28:17.50
Burn yourself out.

1008
01:28:17.50 --> 01:28:24.50
That's a huge difference between how you can just go into, I'm guilty as charged.

1009
01:28:24.50 --> 01:28:28.50
Because like you said, part of judo is energy conservation.

1010
01:28:28.50 --> 01:28:31.50
So for me, I'm really good at conserving energy.

1011
01:28:31.50 --> 01:28:32.50
Yeah.

1012
01:28:32.50 --> 01:28:37.50
You can be cross-side mounted on me and you're not going to make, and I know, I know.

1013
01:28:37.50 --> 01:28:40.50
I'll be arrogant right now.

1014
01:28:40.50 --> 01:28:44.50
If you mounted me, or you got across the side on me,

1015
01:28:44.50 --> 01:28:47.50
and we had one minute left, you cannot submit me.

1016
01:28:47.50 --> 01:28:48.50
You know what I mean?

1017
01:28:48.50 --> 01:28:50.50
You cannot submit me.

1018
01:28:50.50 --> 01:28:51.50
I'm really good.

1019
01:28:51.50 --> 01:28:58.50
I've had Dean Lister, you know, mounted on side control for the last 22 years.

1020
01:28:58.50 --> 01:28:59.50
Yeah.

1021
01:28:59.50 --> 01:29:00.50
Right.

1022
01:29:00.50 --> 01:29:03.50
So I can defend myself well.

1023
01:29:03.50 --> 01:29:06.50
So if you have one minute, now if I gave you five minutes, that's story.

1024
01:29:06.50 --> 01:29:08.50
My people, you've one minute, that's how much time is left.

1025
01:29:08.50 --> 01:29:10.50
So I can completely go into cruise mode.

1026
01:29:10.50 --> 01:29:11.50
Yeah.

1027
01:29:11.50 --> 01:29:12.50
And that's the wrong answer.

1028
01:29:12.50 --> 01:29:16.50
You're going to try and get, if you're trying to survive for some reason.

1029
01:29:16.50 --> 01:29:16.50
Okay.

1030
01:29:16.50 --> 01:29:18.50
Well, then yeah, utilize the conservation skills.

1031
01:29:18.50 --> 01:29:23.50
But if you're trying to get some conditioning work and prepare yourself for a aggressive

1032
01:29:23.50 --> 01:29:27.50
tournament style situations, you best put out.

1033
01:29:27.50 --> 01:29:28.50
Yeah.

1034
01:29:28.50 --> 01:29:32.50
And that's why it kind of, in a way going back to what you said about having a coach is where the coach

1035
01:29:32.50 --> 01:29:33.50
will be like, hey, shark tank.

1036
01:29:33.50 --> 01:29:34.50
Yeah.

1037
01:29:34.50 --> 01:29:35.50
You know something like this.

1038
01:29:35.50 --> 01:29:41.50
They kind of avoid your capability to treat judo as just regular judo to.

1039
01:29:41.50 --> 01:29:44.50
And the energy conservation efficiency, all this stuff.

1040
01:29:44.50 --> 01:29:50.50
You know, that's when a lot of people ask me, what should I do for my first tournament is in three days.

1041
01:29:50.50 --> 01:29:51.50
What should I do?

1042
01:29:51.50 --> 01:29:52.50
What should I look out for?

1043
01:29:52.50 --> 01:29:59.50
And what I tell people is that, okay, the person that you go against and a judo tournament is going to go

1044
01:29:59.50 --> 01:30:03.50
harder against you than anyone has gone against you in the gym period in the story.

1045
01:30:03.50 --> 01:30:10.50
It is a whole, another level of competition that, you know, white belt versus white belt.

1046
01:30:10.50 --> 01:30:16.50
The first time you go in a tournament as a white belt, the person you're going against is going

1047
01:30:16.50 --> 01:30:20.50
harder than anyone has gone against you in the gym period.

1048
01:30:20.50 --> 01:30:21.50
Yeah.

1049
01:30:21.50 --> 01:30:25.50
You can't even when we would have MMA fighters fighting in the UFC.

1050
01:30:25.50 --> 01:30:35.50
It's near impossible to get to get the training partners to go as hard against that guy as, as

1051
01:30:35.50 --> 01:30:38.50
their opponent is going to go.

1052
01:30:38.50 --> 01:30:40.50
It's just, it's just not there.

1053
01:30:40.50 --> 01:30:42.50
There's no legitimate fight.

1054
01:30:42.50 --> 01:30:46.50
Now occasionally, you know, you get guys that are really good training partners and they'll push you,

1055
01:30:46.50 --> 01:30:48.50
but that's why we do Shark Tank.

1056
01:30:48.50 --> 01:30:48.50
Yeah.

1057
01:30:48.50 --> 01:30:55.50
Because it's hard for me to get, you know, four guys lined up to roll with you and everybody's going to go as hard as they possibly can.

1058
01:30:55.50 --> 01:30:55.50
Yeah.

1059
01:30:55.50 --> 01:30:57.50
Everyone's going to match what you match a little bit.

1060
01:30:57.50 --> 01:31:01.50
They're going to use what they have to use and that's so true men and those guys I watch out for.

1061
01:31:01.50 --> 01:31:06.50
There's a bunch of those elements in there when you're in a training scenario because you don't have the,

1062
01:31:06.50 --> 01:31:08.50
you don't have that background.

1063
01:31:08.50 --> 01:31:12.50
Hum of fist means everything like a competition, you know?

1064
01:31:12.50 --> 01:31:13.50
So, yeah.

1065
01:31:13.50 --> 01:31:17.50
I mean, there's actually no who does go super hard as people that have never trained you to before.

1066
01:31:17.50 --> 01:31:20.50
First time in the gym, it's not a competition, but that's the first thing.

1067
01:31:20.50 --> 01:31:21.50
The real feeling of the competition.

1068
01:31:21.50 --> 01:31:22.50
Yeah.

1069
01:31:22.50 --> 01:31:23.50
So true.

1070
01:31:23.50 --> 01:31:31.50
I mean, I've been on the weird, how crazy it is that you just take a guy that completely believes that they can kick everyone's ass.

1071
01:31:31.50 --> 01:31:33.50
Have you bring them the Jiu-Jitsu gym and they just get destroyed?

1072
01:31:33.50 --> 01:31:34.50
Yeah.

1073
01:31:34.50 --> 01:31:35.50
Isn't that crazy?

1074
01:31:35.50 --> 01:31:36.50
Yeah.

1075
01:31:36.50 --> 01:31:37.50
It's a crazy Jiu-Jitsu crazy thing.

1076
01:31:37.50 --> 01:31:38.50
Yeah.

1077
01:31:38.50 --> 01:31:39.50
It's an ego checker.

1078
01:31:39.50 --> 01:31:44.50
That's kind of what I was thinking and something with kind of MMA, I think Jiu-Jitsu and MMA,

1079
01:31:44.50 --> 01:32:02.50
you know, kind of the same deal where it's kind of real, you know, where, you know, you're talking about, you know, veterans come home and they come to everyday life and you people have no idea really what extreme stuff is, you know,

1080
01:32:02.50 --> 01:32:05.50
you're walking around just not knowing.

1081
01:32:05.50 --> 01:32:11.50
Meanwhile, what they've been through is just so extreme and they come back and they know they have that basis for comparison.

1082
01:32:11.50 --> 01:32:12.50
Yeah.

1083
01:32:12.50 --> 01:32:16.50
And, you know, you get the stutters like, you know, mouth in off to the guy, remember?

1084
01:32:16.50 --> 01:32:18.50
He goes, didn't, it didn't war teach you anything?

1085
01:32:18.50 --> 01:32:19.50
Oh, yeah.

1086
01:32:19.50 --> 01:32:20.50
And they don't know.

1087
01:32:20.50 --> 01:32:21.50
They don't know nothing, you know.

1088
01:32:21.50 --> 01:32:26.50
Give them one day, give that teacher one day with, you know, it's just a big eye opener.

1089
01:32:26.50 --> 01:32:30.50
So that's kind of how I feel with, like, Jiu-Jitsu and MMA and stuff.

1090
01:32:30.50 --> 01:32:40.50
And when you go out and when you hear people talking, you know, like, I just don't, I kicked that guy's ass, you know, kind of thing and you're like, oh my gosh, yeah, give you go to the gym one day with, do two rounds.

1091
01:32:40.50 --> 01:32:44.50
I know, no more than three rounds because one round people think you got lucky.

1092
01:32:44.50 --> 01:32:55.50
I know that's the two rounds they go, well, that might have been luck, but and then after you submit someone three times they're like, okay, that there's something I don't understand here and I want to learn it and give them one ten minute round.

1093
01:32:55.50 --> 01:32:56.50
Oh, God.

1094
01:32:56.50 --> 01:33:06.50
I just don't just feel like this, I can't do this. I can't, like, it's to the point, especially early on, you get a ten minute round and you know, because when you're going against someone there's that you're locked into it.

1095
01:33:06.50 --> 01:33:15.50
You have to straight up know what a normal person isn't going to, there will be destroyed after because they're going to be in a competition, why about mode going as hard as they can.

1096
01:33:15.50 --> 01:33:21.50
Again, someone that's not using any strength or energy at all who's destroying them and submitting them every 30 seconds.

1097
01:33:21.50 --> 01:33:26.50
Man, the judge.

1098
01:33:26.50 --> 01:33:32.50
But yeah, the run it, what I did like about running like, you know, three four miles, it what I found that that provided was, you know, when, you know,

1099
01:33:32.50 --> 01:33:36.50
one will take take down battles and no one's getting each other.

1100
01:33:36.50 --> 01:33:45.50
I felt that it really kept me going. Like, just being on your feet doing like low intensity pushing and I really felt that it helped that.

1101
01:33:45.50 --> 01:33:47.50
Yeah, agree.

1102
01:33:47.50 --> 01:33:57.50
Check next question. Next, what advice can you give on pushups and bench press for shoulder and pack injuries slash recovery?

1103
01:33:57.50 --> 01:34:04.50
Okay, real quick for all for all injuries, what I say is do what you can and do to get him out hurting yourself.

1104
01:34:04.50 --> 01:34:09.50
So for instance, if you can't do a full pushup because it hurts your shoulder, guess what?

1105
01:34:09.50 --> 01:34:34.50
Do a quarter pushup and do a bunch of them and just get that range of motion. You're not going to get a full workout, but to get that range of motion, get it working and then maybe in a week you can do a half pushup and then you do half pushups and then in another three weeks you can do a three quarter pushup and then eventually you can do a full pushup and then you start doing your deep pushups in between rings or whatever you get it back.

1106
01:34:34.50 --> 01:34:41.50
That's what I do. I do that with every body part that I have that might be injured for whatever reason I do what I can.

1107
01:34:41.50 --> 01:34:56.50
Yeah, I do what I can. And specifically, I'll tell you what bench press. I would use dumbbells and not barbell because a barbell locks your arm into position and this is very similar to an Americana or a camera.

1108
01:34:56.50 --> 01:35:23.50
Both of those submission moves in GJ2 are based on the same kind of general range of motion as a bench press. There's definitely something different about it and obviously it's you can do bench press. I mean people bench press, you know, hundreds and hundreds of pounds on a barbell. So it can be done, but essentially it is is a similar motion. If you're like with an Americana, which is a submission hold in GJ2.

1109
01:35:23.50 --> 01:35:34.50
If you can move where your wrist is, you can it doesn't hurt at all. You know, if you put your wrist up by your head, it doesn't hurt at all. They can person can do an Americana all day once you bring it down. Now it submits you.

1110
01:35:34.50 --> 01:35:43.50
And that's the way I look at a barbell. That's why I haven't done barbell bench press and I don't even know how long, especially like a going for max. I haven't done that. I don't even remember last time I did it.

1111
01:35:43.50 --> 01:35:54.50
But yeah, for any of these injuries that you might have, do what you can use minimum use the range of motion as you can. Don't re-enter yourself. You know, don't be stupid.

1112
01:35:54.50 --> 01:36:09.50
But if it hurts your knee when you get to a half a squat, do a quarter squat or a little, you know, do a three eighth squat. So that's what I recommend to get through those.

1113
01:36:09.50 --> 01:36:33.50
Yeah, and it's, um, that's kind of the thing. And I know this from, and I had knee surgery and I had a quick recovery, quick recovery. And the reason that was was because, hey, you got to be smart, just like I was saying, get a smart about your don't, I had knee surgery. I'm not going to go max squat, you know, four of this later, you know, kind of thing.

1114
01:36:33.50 --> 01:36:49.50
So yeah, you take it slow, but at the same time, you go, you treat it like a workout. You do seriously. You see, you're serious about it. Yeah, exactly right. So people, some people, I forget when I said, I don't know if I said it on here, but, um, where people would get a shoulder injury, for example.

1115
01:36:49.50 --> 01:37:07.50
And part of the rehab is like these stabilization for your core, and then they'll be like, I'm not going to skip that day because I don't feel anything. That's ab muscles. Why would I do that? I have a shoulder injury. So I'm going to skip that and you know, the next day I'll do my little shoulder exercises. I'll go through the motions and that's it.

1116
01:37:07.50 --> 01:37:22.50
You treat it like a for real workout like where you stretch it, you kind of push yourself, not in weight, but you know, you do a range of motion, all that stuff, every element of your rehab has to be real important to you, including the consistency.

1117
01:37:22.50 --> 01:37:37.50
And if you do it that way, that'll be how. Don't, to me, and I don't know, I don't know the history of the this question or nothing, but bench press for shoulder injuries in recovery.

1118
01:37:37.50 --> 01:37:52.50
They, they, they're no, yeah, they don't, that's not a hand in hand thing like so if you if you're concerned about whether you know whether not to get your bench back up after you have a shoulder injury, okay, but they still the bench has nothing to do with recovery from the shoulder injury.

1119
01:37:52.50 --> 01:38:12.50
What she do is all the little stable, stable, as they should muscles in there, like these weird motions and stuff like that, a lot of times that's worth another good, another good compliment. This is why it is shoulder injury and it hurt really bad to do regular pushups, but I could do ring pushups because it allows you to move away from those range of merchants that hurt you.

1120
01:38:12.50 --> 01:38:24.50
So that's good, but yeah bench press for shoulder not good, I had a guy, a new guy officer and Ramadi who had showed up during deployment and he had a bad shoulder for something.

1121
01:38:24.50 --> 01:38:32.50
He's like, hey sir, I was wondering if you can be any good, you know, exercises I could do for for my shoulder, which I have, you know, a bad shoulder.

1122
01:38:32.50 --> 01:38:42.50
I was like, yeah, you muscle ups and he kind of looked at me a little strange and then later realized that you know, I was having fun and that's a joke.

1123
01:38:42.50 --> 01:38:50.50
He luckily didn't like he'd my advice at the time. He just thought, wow, this guy's a insane.

1124
01:38:50.50 --> 01:38:58.50
So a little range was rotators, any rotators stuff like this, like throwing ball motion just controlled and that's been to get you back.

1125
01:38:58.50 --> 01:39:10.50
You can recover, you can recover from it. That's the thing and again, you have just treat those rehab because there's nothing glamorous about this that throwing motion, actually like a rotator cuff exercise.

1126
01:39:10.50 --> 01:39:12.50
There's nothing else exactly right.

1127
01:39:12.50 --> 01:39:14.50
So people will be like, oh yeah, I'm not doing that.

1128
01:39:14.50 --> 01:39:19.50
You know, when I'm going to mention as you know, I'm doing some, you know, my very first year.

1129
01:39:19.50 --> 01:39:31.50
But if you do breast sergeant like demonstrating, I had a kind of a in the shoulder like from the day before and sergeants like dang you know, sergeant demonstrates kind of heavy handededly and he rips my shoulder and it I felt it pop out.

1130
01:39:31.50 --> 01:39:34.50
So now I can't lift anything above my head.

1131
01:39:34.50 --> 01:39:37.50
So all I did was that rotator cuff.

1132
01:39:37.50 --> 01:39:41.50
Oh, it's like a program. It's like this way, front back and then down here this way.

1133
01:39:41.50 --> 01:39:50.50
And it was only for like two weeks and it was just back. Yeah, it's unfortunately sergeant moved Connecticut because he's one of my favorite training partners.

1134
01:39:50.50 --> 01:39:53.50
Yeah, so he can do an accurate little after.

1135
01:39:53.50 --> 01:39:54.50
Yeah, yeah.

1136
01:39:54.50 --> 01:40:00.50
And when he gets when he's like his go to because he wrestled and he's got a sick double.

1137
01:40:00.50 --> 01:40:06.50
He would just get in this double leg mode and he get up or something like we'd be scrambling. He get up and I'd see the look on his face.

1138
01:40:06.50 --> 01:40:11.50
Here it comes. Here it comes and he blast that double.

1139
01:40:11.50 --> 01:40:13.50
Hit that so hard launch me.

1140
01:40:13.50 --> 01:40:18.50
Remember one time I rolled with him and and I think you may have like seen part of it or something and you were like,

1141
01:40:18.50 --> 01:40:22.50
Oh, how was it rolling with sergeant? Like, yeah, you know how you kind of explain how the roll went or whatever.

1142
01:40:22.50 --> 01:40:30.50
And I was like, yeah, man, and then he got he turned on this moody. You were like, oh, yeah, he's charged out on the foot.

1143
01:40:30.50 --> 01:40:45.50
And he was like, did you ever see him do that a sling shot? So he used to have this defense from from getting triangle and he would just I can't really explain it, but he would basically launch the other human being across the map.

1144
01:40:45.50 --> 01:40:47.50
And it was awesome.

1145
01:40:47.50 --> 01:40:49.50
I'd say somebody locked up a and he didn't care.

1146
01:40:49.50 --> 01:40:58.50
Like, he's probably put a triangle on him and he just he'd go into he'd do the sling shot and you just laugh at it because he know he's getting ready to launch somebody.

1147
01:40:58.50 --> 01:41:05.50
So yeah, got a screw in Connecticut, by the way, if you're in Connecticut you can go train there.

1148
01:41:05.50 --> 01:41:07.50
What is it, what's the call? It ain't no that.

1149
01:41:07.50 --> 01:41:10.50
It's called GG2 life. That's what it's called.

1150
01:41:10.50 --> 01:41:11.50
Okay. There you go.

1151
01:41:11.50 --> 01:41:12.50
Yeah.

1152
01:41:12.50 --> 01:41:22.50
Do one of my old teammates and one of my long time training partners to get some with.

1153
01:41:22.50 --> 01:41:23.50
Next. Next.

1154
01:41:23.50 --> 01:41:30.50
Do you prep your own food daily or eat on the hoof and grab what you can?

1155
01:41:30.50 --> 01:41:39.50
I do both. If I if you know, I generally don't pack up something and make a little meal because my travels are weird and random.

1156
01:41:39.50 --> 01:41:41.50
But.

1157
01:41:41.50 --> 01:41:44.50
Yeah. So when I can't I and I'm at home.

1158
01:41:44.50 --> 01:41:46.50
So I make something up. Yeah.

1159
01:41:46.50 --> 01:41:50.50
But I eat out a decent amount. I got my go to's and I go eat there.

1160
01:41:50.50 --> 01:41:54.50
Sometimes they make good food for me. Yeah.

1161
01:41:54.50 --> 01:41:58.50
If you're on the program like back in the dreams.

1162
01:41:58.50 --> 01:42:00.50
Yeah. When I was at the same side, bring lunch for sure.

1163
01:42:00.50 --> 01:42:04.50
But it was never lunch because I never ate lunch. Never ate lunch.

1164
01:42:04.50 --> 01:42:08.50
Never. Remember, it was like, okay, guys. I'm going to go and leave me alone for next hour because I'm going to go eat lunch.

1165
01:42:08.50 --> 01:42:13.50
No, never ate lunch. Never. You never see me saying, hey, guys, okay.

1166
01:42:13.50 --> 01:42:16.50
Let's call it for now and we'll go eat lunch. And we'll meet you back here in an hour.

1167
01:42:16.50 --> 01:42:18.50
No, not how you know don't eat lunch.

1168
01:42:18.50 --> 01:42:20.50
So what do you do? Work through lunch and stay late.

1169
01:42:20.50 --> 01:42:22.50
And then so when to eat, then just eat.

1170
01:42:22.50 --> 01:42:23.50
Oh, great.

1171
01:42:23.50 --> 01:42:24.50
I'm a bit graceful. Yeah.

1172
01:42:24.50 --> 01:42:28.50
Like I can eat and be on the phone. I can eat and be at the computer.

1173
01:42:28.50 --> 01:42:31.50
I can eat and you know, unless we're doing something physical.

1174
01:42:31.50 --> 01:42:32.50
Hmm.

1175
01:42:32.50 --> 01:42:34.50
And even then eat while you're doing something physical.

1176
01:42:34.50 --> 01:42:35.50
As long as you're not doing not.

1177
01:42:35.50 --> 01:42:36.50
I'm a meth con.

1178
01:42:36.50 --> 01:42:38.50
They carry me.

1179
01:42:38.50 --> 01:42:42.50
You miss this one. What would you recommend for striking training is an effective real application practice.

1180
01:42:42.50 --> 01:42:43.50
Boxing.

1181
01:42:43.50 --> 01:42:44.50
Mointai.

1182
01:42:44.50 --> 01:42:44.50
Moica.

1183
01:42:44.50 --> 01:42:46.50
That's real easy.

1184
01:42:46.50 --> 01:42:49.50
Start with boxing because it's easier to learn. You don't have to throw big kicks.

1185
01:42:49.50 --> 01:42:52.50
But it's very effective martial art boxing.

1186
01:42:52.50 --> 01:42:59.50
And then once you get decent at that, you just now you can go into Mointai and learn how to use your legs, your elbows, your head.

1187
01:42:59.50 --> 01:43:00.50
So there you go.

1188
01:43:00.50 --> 01:43:01.50
Yeah.

1189
01:43:01.50 --> 01:43:04.50
I agree. The boxing too. And this is strange.

1190
01:43:04.50 --> 01:43:06.50
But it's absolutely true.

1191
01:43:06.50 --> 01:43:11.50
Is if you, if you don't have experience throwing punches and landing punches,

1192
01:43:11.50 --> 01:43:15.50
it's surprisingly hard to punch someone's face.

1193
01:43:15.50 --> 01:43:17.50
And landed effectively.

1194
01:43:17.50 --> 01:43:18.50
Yeah.

1195
01:43:18.50 --> 01:43:19.50
You know how like,

1196
01:43:19.50 --> 01:43:21.50
I got the movies.

1197
01:43:21.50 --> 01:43:23.50
You see.

1198
01:43:23.50 --> 01:43:24.50
I saw him a guy.

1199
01:43:24.50 --> 01:43:27.50
I realized, you guys are used to punch people and then he always shake his hand.

1200
01:43:27.50 --> 01:43:28.50
Like,

1201
01:43:28.50 --> 01:43:29.50
Oh, you know.

1202
01:43:29.50 --> 01:43:29.50
Yeah.

1203
01:43:29.50 --> 01:43:30.50
Like, I hurt my hand.

1204
01:43:30.50 --> 01:43:32.50
Every that was kind of one of the funnier things about your punch.

1205
01:43:32.50 --> 01:43:33.50
That's the thing.

1206
01:43:33.50 --> 01:43:34.50
Actually, that was funny.

1207
01:43:34.50 --> 01:43:36.50
I'm sure I'm a guy where they're trying to make like,

1208
01:43:36.50 --> 01:43:39.50
Oh my guy versus such a softy in that way.

1209
01:43:39.50 --> 01:43:40.50
That's a hard one.

1210
01:43:40.50 --> 01:43:41.50
He's hard for him.

1211
01:43:41.50 --> 01:43:42.50
Like,

1212
01:43:42.50 --> 01:43:43.50
his brain.

1213
01:43:43.50 --> 01:43:44.50
He's super smart.

1214
01:43:44.50 --> 01:43:46.50
So, you know, he doesn't carry a gun.

1215
01:43:46.50 --> 01:43:47.50
You know, he's not that guy.

1216
01:43:47.50 --> 01:43:48.50
Everyone has a paperclip.

1217
01:43:48.50 --> 01:43:49.50
He has a brain.

1218
01:43:49.50 --> 01:43:49.50
Yeah.

1219
01:43:49.50 --> 01:43:50.50
Exactly.

1220
01:43:50.50 --> 01:43:51.50
They're right.

1221
01:43:51.50 --> 01:43:51.50
Paperclip.

1222
01:43:51.50 --> 01:43:52.50
I mean, I've nonetheless.

1223
01:43:52.50 --> 01:43:54.50
That's kind of what that was indicating.

1224
01:43:54.50 --> 01:43:57.50
But I thought it taught kind of a good lesson where

1225
01:43:57.50 --> 01:43:59.50
if you, you know, you watch on TV,

1226
01:43:59.50 --> 01:44:02.50
guys just punching guys in the face and the head.

1227
01:44:02.50 --> 01:44:06.50
But you can, if especially if you don't have a experience punchy,

1228
01:44:06.50 --> 01:44:09.50
and you can probably will break your hand.

1229
01:44:09.50 --> 01:44:10.50
Yeah.

1230
01:44:10.50 --> 01:44:11.50
Or hurt your hand.

1231
01:44:11.50 --> 01:44:11.50
Yeah.

1232
01:44:11.50 --> 01:44:14.50
So if you, if you go train boxing, even just once a week,

1233
01:44:14.50 --> 01:44:17.50
a little some boxing or whatever, you really get to learn like,

1234
01:44:17.50 --> 01:44:19.50
okay, if I'd start throwing these punches,

1235
01:44:19.50 --> 01:44:20.50
the different between it.

1236
01:44:20.50 --> 01:44:21.50
It's just like,

1237
01:44:21.50 --> 01:44:23.50
you get to like six months of

1238
01:44:23.50 --> 01:44:26.50
you get to destroy someone with no you get to six months of boxing,

1239
01:44:26.50 --> 01:44:29.50
does pretty damn good against someone with no boxing.

1240
01:44:29.50 --> 01:44:30.50
For sure.

1241
01:44:30.50 --> 01:44:31.50
Yeah.

1242
01:44:31.50 --> 01:44:31.50
Yeah.

1243
01:44:31.50 --> 01:44:33.50
The only thing with boxing and like striking,

1244
01:44:33.50 --> 01:44:35.50
you can kind of, not really.

1245
01:44:35.50 --> 01:44:36.50
I mean, people are going to get mad at,

1246
01:44:36.50 --> 01:44:37.50
even saying this.

1247
01:44:37.50 --> 01:44:39.50
But I'll mean this like straight up literally,

1248
01:44:39.50 --> 01:44:42.50
but in the streets, you can have kind of some training.

1249
01:44:42.50 --> 01:44:44.50
You know how like if you get in a bunch of street fights,

1250
01:44:44.50 --> 01:44:45.50
I'll tell us.

1251
01:44:45.50 --> 01:44:45.50
Yeah.

1252
01:44:45.50 --> 01:44:45.50
Yeah.

1253
01:44:45.50 --> 01:44:45.50
Yeah.

1254
01:44:45.50 --> 01:44:47.50
And you punch people to the face.

1255
01:44:47.50 --> 01:44:48.50
You learn, yeah.

1256
01:44:48.50 --> 01:44:48.50
Exactly.

1257
01:44:48.50 --> 01:44:49.50
You learn what you learn.

1258
01:44:49.50 --> 01:44:50.50
Don't want you to learn.

1259
01:44:50.50 --> 01:44:53.50
Actually mostly from being a legit street fighter,

1260
01:44:53.50 --> 01:44:54.50
is you learn the mindset.

1261
01:44:54.50 --> 01:44:54.50
Yeah.

1262
01:44:54.50 --> 01:44:55.50
Yeah.

1263
01:44:55.50 --> 01:44:55.50
Yeah.

1264
01:44:55.50 --> 01:44:55.50
Yeah.

1265
01:44:55.50 --> 01:44:55.50
Yeah.

1266
01:44:55.50 --> 01:44:55.50
Yeah.

1267
01:44:55.50 --> 01:44:56.50
No stupid.

1268
01:44:56.50 --> 01:44:56.50
Is that sounds?

1269
01:44:56.50 --> 01:44:57.50
But here's what you learn.

1270
01:44:57.50 --> 01:44:59.50
If I punch this guy as fast as I can before he's expecting it.

1271
01:44:59.50 --> 01:45:00.50
And I'm a soccer punch.

1272
01:45:00.50 --> 01:45:01.50
You'll become a good street fighter.

1273
01:45:01.50 --> 01:45:03.50
That's what street fighting is.

1274
01:45:03.50 --> 01:45:05.50
Street fighting a lot is done on aggression.

1275
01:45:05.50 --> 01:45:08.50
You know, and if you get in my face and I punch you in the face, you know,

1276
01:45:08.50 --> 01:45:09.50
if you look at me and say, what's your problem?

1277
01:45:09.50 --> 01:45:10.50
And I hit you.

1278
01:45:10.50 --> 01:45:11.50
Yeah.

1279
01:45:11.50 --> 01:45:14.50
That's what I'll read like a good experience street fighter that kicks a lot of people's

1280
01:45:14.50 --> 01:45:15.50
asses.

1281
01:45:15.50 --> 01:45:16.50
That's what they do.

1282
01:45:16.50 --> 01:45:17.50
They are over aggressive.

1283
01:45:17.50 --> 01:45:19.50
They don't care about getting a fight.

1284
01:45:19.50 --> 01:45:20.50
They're not thinking about their fighting.

1285
01:45:20.50 --> 01:45:23.50
And so when you say, hey, what's your pack?

1286
01:45:23.50 --> 01:45:23.50
Right.

1287
01:45:23.50 --> 01:45:25.50
Or the guy says, hey, what do you look crack?

1288
01:45:25.50 --> 01:45:27.50
That's what a street fighter is.

1289
01:45:27.50 --> 01:45:29.50
They're going to take action very quickly.

1290
01:45:29.50 --> 01:45:30.50
Yeah.

1291
01:45:30.50 --> 01:45:32.50
That's so you can learn a lot from that.

1292
01:45:32.50 --> 01:45:34.50
So when you take that and someone, you know,

1293
01:45:34.50 --> 01:45:37.50
when someone shows up at the MMA gym and this is, we know I got a lot of street

1294
01:45:37.50 --> 01:45:38.50
fights.

1295
01:45:38.50 --> 01:45:38.50
Yeah.

1296
01:45:38.50 --> 01:45:42.50
And if they're that's most of the time that's bullshit, but if it's not,

1297
01:45:42.50 --> 01:45:46.50
and they're actually a guy that's been in a lot of fights, and it's only so helpful

1298
01:45:46.50 --> 01:45:50.50
because now they got someone that they're going to shake hands with and then

1299
01:45:50.50 --> 01:45:51.50
engage in combat.

1300
01:45:51.50 --> 01:45:55.50
So they've lost the what, and I'm not saying it's a not a real thing.

1301
01:45:55.50 --> 01:45:58.50
You know, some of my friends growing up were really good street fighters.

1302
01:45:58.50 --> 01:45:59.50
And this is how I'm saying.

1303
01:45:59.50 --> 01:46:03.50
That's with kind of a little bit of knowledge is my friends that were really good street

1304
01:46:03.50 --> 01:46:04.50
fighters.

1305
01:46:04.50 --> 01:46:06.50
What was made them good street fighters?

1306
01:46:06.50 --> 01:46:07.50
Wasn't that they studied boxing?

1307
01:46:07.50 --> 01:46:11.50
Wasn't that they studied you do to it was because they had a very aggressive mindset.

1308
01:46:11.50 --> 01:46:13.50
And so some of them would say,

1309
01:46:13.50 --> 01:46:15.50
Hey, what's your crack and they were going ballistic?

1310
01:46:15.50 --> 01:46:16.50
Right, right.

1311
01:46:16.50 --> 01:46:19.50
You know, or someone's is, what do you look at crack and that's it?

1312
01:46:19.50 --> 01:46:20.50
And it wasn't actually it wasn't crack.

1313
01:46:20.50 --> 01:46:21.50
Crack.

1314
01:46:21.50 --> 01:46:23.50
Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.

1315
01:46:23.50 --> 01:46:28.50
Or, you know, that's so yes, that's what a street fighter has.

1316
01:46:28.50 --> 01:46:32.50
They have a mindset of they have been in fights before, but they know that

1317
01:46:32.50 --> 01:46:34.74
but they know that the aggression will take them a long way.

1318
01:46:34.74 --> 01:46:40.82
Yeah, it's kind of like a guy in the say basketball who, you know, he has a home court

1319
01:46:40.82 --> 01:46:43.22
or something and he just shoots a lot of shots, you know.

1320
01:46:43.22 --> 01:46:44.22
Yeah.

1321
01:46:44.22 --> 01:46:47.38
He knows he knows how to make those shots, but then now you put them on the basketball court.

1322
01:46:47.38 --> 01:46:50.10
You have no technical training with dribbling or anything.

1323
01:46:50.10 --> 01:46:51.10
Yeah.

1324
01:46:51.10 --> 01:46:51.94
Yes, that is true.

1325
01:46:51.94 --> 01:46:52.78
That is true.

1326
01:46:52.78 --> 01:46:54.82
You can learn the mechanics.

1327
01:46:54.82 --> 01:46:55.82
Yeah.

1328
01:46:55.82 --> 01:46:56.82
And then you're on your own.

1329
01:46:56.82 --> 01:46:57.82
On your own.

1330
01:46:57.82 --> 01:46:59.50
Learn the mechanics, but the mechanics.

1331
01:46:59.50 --> 01:47:02.94
And then you can, and the mechanics are going to be almost less helpful.

1332
01:47:02.94 --> 01:47:03.94
Yeah.

1333
01:47:03.94 --> 01:47:06.86
That's what I'm going to actually understanding the mindset of what's going to happen

1334
01:47:06.86 --> 01:47:07.86
in a fight.

1335
01:47:07.86 --> 01:47:12.46
Now the mechanics will be more helpful in basketball, but it's not once you get in a real

1336
01:47:12.46 --> 01:47:13.46
game.

1337
01:47:13.46 --> 01:47:18.02
The first basketball game I ever played, I knew the mechanics and I got destroyed every

1338
01:47:18.02 --> 01:47:21.70
pass I threw for the first 10 passes I threw got picked off and the guys going down the

1339
01:47:21.70 --> 01:47:22.94
other other in the court and scored.

1340
01:47:22.94 --> 01:47:24.42
I'm not even kidding.

1341
01:47:24.42 --> 01:47:25.42
That happened.

1342
01:47:25.42 --> 01:47:29.30
My dad was like a Hoosier's kind of guy to your movie Hoosiers.

1343
01:47:29.30 --> 01:47:30.86
It's like, hey, you're going to work the mechanics.

1344
01:47:30.86 --> 01:47:32.02
You're going to work ball handling.

1345
01:47:32.02 --> 01:47:33.86
You're going to work passing, not shooting.

1346
01:47:33.86 --> 01:47:37.06
No sparring or what is it called?

1347
01:47:37.06 --> 01:47:38.06
Scrimmaging, right?

1348
01:47:38.06 --> 01:47:39.06
You're just going to learn the mechanics.

1349
01:47:39.06 --> 01:47:41.58
And then that would have been cool if I would have had a coach that had a different

1350
01:47:41.58 --> 01:47:46.50
mindset, but the coach had the same Hoosier mindset as my dad, which is mechanics, mechanics,

1351
01:47:46.50 --> 01:47:47.50
mechanics.

1352
01:47:47.50 --> 01:47:48.50
So I worked on all these mechanics.

1353
01:47:48.50 --> 01:47:49.86
I had really good ball handling.

1354
01:47:49.86 --> 01:47:51.18
I had good passing.

1355
01:47:51.18 --> 01:47:56.18
And then I got, it was the first game I played in basketball.

1356
01:47:56.18 --> 01:48:02.06
I had never actually was a, maybe I'd done a couple live games, but I'd never played against

1357
01:48:02.06 --> 01:48:03.06
anyone's skill.

1358
01:48:03.06 --> 01:48:04.06
Driveled down the court.

1359
01:48:04.06 --> 01:48:05.06
I was a point.

1360
01:48:05.06 --> 01:48:07.90
I driveled down the court, held up my fingers about, okay, we're going to run play

1361
01:48:07.90 --> 01:48:09.62
number three.

1362
01:48:09.62 --> 01:48:13.46
Went over the side through the ball and the dude just picked it off.

1363
01:48:13.46 --> 01:48:15.66
And the kid that I was playing against was a really good player.

1364
01:48:15.66 --> 01:48:18.66
The other guy that was guarding me just destroyed me.

1365
01:48:18.66 --> 01:48:22.94
And the reason was, didn't have the experience of live games.

1366
01:48:22.94 --> 01:48:26.50
Now I actually brought that mentality when I was running training.

1367
01:48:26.50 --> 01:48:28.82
I always, you know, you can sit there and learn mechanics in the kill house.

1368
01:48:28.82 --> 01:48:33.54
So you can sit there and learn mechanics of doing immediate action drills out in the field.

1369
01:48:33.54 --> 01:48:35.18
The mechanics are good.

1370
01:48:35.18 --> 01:48:37.94
You have to know them, but you have to also be live.

1371
01:48:37.94 --> 01:48:42.98
And that's why I loved when they went to seal teams when we went from just having live

1372
01:48:42.98 --> 01:48:48.66
rounds and paper targets, which everyone was that was the highest form.

1373
01:48:48.66 --> 01:48:51.74
Hey, we train, we train with live fire.

1374
01:48:51.74 --> 01:48:53.06
That's the best thing.

1375
01:48:53.06 --> 01:48:54.62
And that's what I was raised to believe.

1376
01:48:54.62 --> 01:48:57.96
As soon as I saw, we had to send munition and then once I realized how effective

1377
01:48:57.96 --> 01:49:00.54
simulation was, I was like, you know, even need some munition, you can go run around

1378
01:49:00.54 --> 01:49:03.70
literally saying bang, bang at each other, but you got people moving and it's going to help

1379
01:49:03.70 --> 01:49:04.70
you.

1380
01:49:04.70 --> 01:49:10.42
So that mindset came from trying to not be just be Hoosiers.

1381
01:49:10.42 --> 01:49:14.86
You know, Hoosiers, the movie Hoosiers, the basketball movie, it's an awesome movie.

1382
01:49:14.86 --> 01:49:17.78
But the beginning is all just drilling.

1383
01:49:17.78 --> 01:49:21.22
And my dad, because I didn't play basketball, I said, don't want to play basketball.

1384
01:49:21.22 --> 01:49:24.30
He said, okay, so he's teaching me how to play basketball, but he was like a Hoosier guy.

1385
01:49:24.30 --> 01:49:25.30
You're going to be a good defense.

1386
01:49:25.30 --> 01:49:27.30
You're going to be a good ball handling.

1387
01:49:27.30 --> 01:49:29.34
And then, unfortunately, my coach was the same way.

1388
01:49:29.34 --> 01:49:30.86
My first coach was the same way.

1389
01:49:30.86 --> 01:49:32.26
7th grade or 8th grade.

1390
01:49:32.26 --> 01:49:35.90
Just like, hey, Hoosiers, we're going to have good defense.

1391
01:49:35.90 --> 01:49:36.90
And I dribbled out the court.

1392
01:49:36.90 --> 01:49:37.90
Got, well, I didn't.

1393
01:49:37.90 --> 01:49:40.18
So be careful with that.

1394
01:49:40.18 --> 01:49:44.14
But someone that played streetball, someone that played streetball.

1395
01:49:44.14 --> 01:49:45.14
Yeah.

1396
01:49:45.14 --> 01:49:49.58
And didn't know whenever taught in ball handling, no one ever taught him the theory behind

1397
01:49:49.58 --> 01:49:56.30
a zone defense, that guy would have done infinitely better than I did in my first basketball

1398
01:49:56.30 --> 01:49:57.30
game.

1399
01:49:57.30 --> 01:49:58.90
My dad must have been hanging as well.

1400
01:49:58.90 --> 01:49:59.90
He was shame.

1401
01:49:59.90 --> 01:50:05.10
He must have been what I'd lose or how did I raise this kid?

1402
01:50:05.10 --> 01:50:06.10
Well, yeah.

1403
01:50:06.10 --> 01:50:07.10
That's true.

1404
01:50:07.10 --> 01:50:09.10
It's the same kind of thing.

1405
01:50:09.10 --> 01:50:13.18
Yeah, those street fighters, they know how it feels to land upon.

1406
01:50:13.18 --> 01:50:17.98
They know, they have this kind of intuitive gauge on kind of distance in a way, just

1407
01:50:17.98 --> 01:50:18.98
if they've been there.

1408
01:50:18.98 --> 01:50:19.98
Yeah.

1409
01:50:19.98 --> 01:50:23.06
And so that's why when you train people for anything, even in the business world, like

1410
01:50:23.06 --> 01:50:26.90
you don't just train the people, the mechanics of a conversation that they're supposed

1411
01:50:26.90 --> 01:50:27.90
to have if they're a leader.

1412
01:50:27.90 --> 01:50:28.90
Just don't train them on the mechanics.

1413
01:50:28.90 --> 01:50:29.90
Here's what you say.

1414
01:50:29.90 --> 01:50:30.90
Read this script.

1415
01:50:30.90 --> 01:50:31.90
No.

1416
01:50:31.90 --> 01:50:32.90
Put them live fire.

1417
01:50:32.90 --> 01:50:33.90
I'm in there.

1418
01:50:33.90 --> 01:50:34.90
When I'm live fire.

1419
01:50:34.90 --> 01:50:35.90
Roll play with them.

1420
01:50:35.90 --> 01:50:36.90
How I'm sit with you?

1421
01:50:36.90 --> 01:50:37.90
Are you going through something?

1422
01:50:37.90 --> 01:50:38.74
Have them go in there and talk to somebody that you told them how to act and act all

1423
01:50:38.74 --> 01:50:39.74
crazy.

1424
01:50:39.74 --> 01:50:40.74
Do that with them.

1425
01:50:40.74 --> 01:50:41.74
Yeah.

1426
01:50:41.74 --> 01:50:42.74
Check.

1427
01:50:42.74 --> 01:50:43.74
Check.

1428
01:50:43.74 --> 01:50:46.94
Do you take creating?

1429
01:50:46.94 --> 01:50:48.34
I do not take creating.

1430
01:50:48.34 --> 01:50:49.50
I have taken creating.

1431
01:50:49.50 --> 01:50:53.94
I believe it is an effective supplement when you remember Fossford, Jim.

1432
01:50:53.94 --> 01:50:54.94
Yeah.

1433
01:50:54.94 --> 01:50:57.18
When that came out, that was the first creating supplement.

1434
01:50:57.18 --> 01:50:59.02
I was drinking so much that it was vanilla.

1435
01:50:59.02 --> 01:51:01.18
It was disgusting.

1436
01:51:01.18 --> 01:51:05.02
And I was on the, I was on a ship at the time with a seal platoon and we were all trying

1437
01:51:05.02 --> 01:51:06.02
to get as big as possible.

1438
01:51:06.02 --> 01:51:07.22
We were all taking creating.

1439
01:51:07.22 --> 01:51:12.26
I was drinking so much Fossford gain that I had to hold my nose and do it.

1440
01:51:12.26 --> 01:51:14.26
You know, hold my nose and do it like a shot.

1441
01:51:14.26 --> 01:51:15.66
So they'd be wanting to throw up.

1442
01:51:15.66 --> 01:51:17.22
So let's like a weight gainer.

1443
01:51:17.22 --> 01:51:18.22
Fossford gainer.

1444
01:51:18.22 --> 01:51:19.22
Yeah.

1445
01:51:19.22 --> 01:51:20.22
And then this Fossfro gainer.

1446
01:51:20.22 --> 01:51:21.22
Yeah.

1447
01:51:21.22 --> 01:51:22.22
Yeah.

1448
01:51:22.22 --> 01:51:23.58
Which everyone I was on Fossford gain.

1449
01:51:23.58 --> 01:51:24.58
And it was only vanilla flavor.

1450
01:51:24.58 --> 01:51:26.58
Which I don't even like vanilla flavor.

1451
01:51:26.58 --> 01:51:27.58
That's there.

1452
01:51:27.58 --> 01:51:29.58
There is a mistake.

1453
01:51:29.58 --> 01:51:30.58
No.

1454
01:51:30.58 --> 01:51:31.82
And that was only Alfred at the time when it first came out.

1455
01:51:31.82 --> 01:51:34.38
Because we were all in the game.

1456
01:51:34.38 --> 01:51:35.38
But yeah.

1457
01:51:35.38 --> 01:51:36.38
Createne is effective.

1458
01:51:36.38 --> 01:51:40.98
I never really had any of the big side effects where people say you get dehydrated.

1459
01:51:40.98 --> 01:51:41.98
Whatever.

1460
01:51:41.98 --> 01:51:42.98
I never really had that bloated.

1461
01:51:42.98 --> 01:51:44.18
I never really felt much of that.

1462
01:51:44.18 --> 01:51:45.98
But I don't take creatine right now.

1463
01:51:45.98 --> 01:51:47.38
I haven't taken it for a long time.

1464
01:51:47.38 --> 01:51:48.38
Me neither.

1465
01:51:48.38 --> 01:51:49.38
And I don't.

1466
01:51:49.38 --> 01:51:51.42
Actually I never did.

1467
01:51:51.42 --> 01:51:52.42
Maybe.

1468
01:51:52.42 --> 01:51:56.02
No, I took this thing called Baytage and I think there was creatine in that.

1469
01:51:56.02 --> 01:51:57.50
It was like long time ago.

1470
01:51:57.50 --> 01:51:58.50
Yeah.

1471
01:51:58.50 --> 01:51:59.50
And who's too good?

1472
01:51:59.50 --> 01:52:00.50
I think.

1473
01:52:00.50 --> 01:52:01.50
I mean, I don't know.

1474
01:52:01.50 --> 01:52:03.50
But yeah, I don't know much about it.

1475
01:52:03.50 --> 01:52:06.10
As far as what's true and what's not here great things.

1476
01:52:06.10 --> 01:52:07.50
And I hear jump things.

1477
01:52:07.50 --> 01:52:09.74
Welcome to the Interwebs.

1478
01:52:09.74 --> 01:52:10.74
Yeah.

1479
01:52:10.74 --> 01:52:11.74
Next.

1480
01:52:11.74 --> 01:52:13.74
Do you ever?

1481
01:52:13.74 --> 01:52:17.34
It's you ever surf in Europe.

1482
01:52:17.34 --> 01:52:18.50
I have not surfed in Europe.

1483
01:52:18.50 --> 01:52:20.02
I would like to surf in Europe.

1484
01:52:20.02 --> 01:52:24.50
I know that you boys up in Ireland got some big slabs.

1485
01:52:24.50 --> 01:52:27.54
So maybe at some point I'll get up and surf what their looks awesome.

1486
01:52:27.54 --> 01:52:28.54
It's very inconsistent.

1487
01:52:28.54 --> 01:52:31.74
They're one very crazy with the title differences.

1488
01:52:31.74 --> 01:52:33.06
So that's a point.

1489
01:52:33.06 --> 01:52:34.06
Yeah.

1490
01:52:34.06 --> 01:52:35.06
Would be cool.

1491
01:52:35.06 --> 01:52:36.74
You're a surf in Hawaii?

1492
01:52:36.74 --> 01:52:37.74
I have.

1493
01:52:37.74 --> 01:52:39.54
I have, yes.

1494
01:52:39.54 --> 01:52:40.86
You were bitten a coli before?

1495
01:52:40.86 --> 01:52:41.86
No.

1496
01:52:41.86 --> 01:52:42.86
All right.

1497
01:52:42.86 --> 01:52:43.86
I'm gonna start a 70th.

1498
01:52:43.86 --> 01:52:45.02
Think about it.

1499
01:52:45.02 --> 01:52:46.02
Next question.

1500
01:52:46.02 --> 01:52:47.26
Check.

1501
01:52:47.26 --> 01:52:48.78
I have a bad back.

1502
01:52:48.78 --> 01:52:51.22
And I need to lose 100 pounds.

1503
01:52:51.22 --> 01:52:55.58
Any advice on what exercise is to start with to kick start things.

1504
01:52:55.58 --> 01:52:57.58
You have a bad back and you need to take care of that.

1505
01:52:57.58 --> 01:52:58.94
And I have no idea what that means.

1506
01:52:58.94 --> 01:53:01.38
That could mean so many different things.

1507
01:53:01.38 --> 01:53:05.60
What you need to do is you need to probably, you know, start to figure out what you can

1508
01:53:05.60 --> 01:53:06.60
do.

1509
01:53:06.60 --> 01:53:11.16
You probably want to go to your doctor and say, hey, what can I can not.

1510
01:53:11.16 --> 01:53:12.22
What can I do?

1511
01:53:12.22 --> 01:53:14.10
what can I not do?

1512
01:53:14.10 --> 01:53:17.10
And then doctors sometimes are overly cautious.

1513
01:53:17.10 --> 01:53:18.32
So maybe get a second opinion,

1514
01:53:18.32 --> 01:53:19.10
see what you can do with earth,

1515
01:53:19.10 --> 01:53:21.02
but the bottom line is, if you've got a hundred pounds

1516
01:53:21.02 --> 01:53:22.58
to lose, here's what you need to do.

1517
01:53:22.58 --> 01:53:26.22
Start moving, some way, somehow,

1518
01:53:26.22 --> 01:53:28.02
whether that starts off as walking,

1519
01:53:28.02 --> 01:53:30.26
whether that starts off as doing some calisthenics,

1520
01:53:30.26 --> 01:53:32.34
whether it starts off as riding an exercise bike,

1521
01:53:32.34 --> 01:53:33.74
you need to start moving.

1522
01:53:33.74 --> 01:53:34.94
That's what you need to do.

1523
01:53:34.94 --> 01:53:37.10
And then you need to fix the diet,

1524
01:53:37.10 --> 01:53:38.34
because that's where most of that weight loss

1525
01:53:38.34 --> 01:53:39.66
is gonna come from.

1526
01:53:39.66 --> 01:53:42.74
And that's the best ways to kick start things.

1527
01:53:43.82 --> 01:53:44.94
Agreed, yes.

1528
01:53:44.94 --> 01:53:45.94
And you know how?

1529
01:53:47.62 --> 01:53:48.62
Okay, the diet thing.

1530
01:53:49.74 --> 01:53:50.58
Real quick.

1531
01:53:50.58 --> 01:53:52.50
You know how like certain things

1532
01:53:52.50 --> 01:53:54.14
you go into certain situations

1533
01:53:54.14 --> 01:53:57.94
and you're hit with feelings or certain things

1534
01:53:57.94 --> 01:53:58.82
that you weren't expecting,

1535
01:53:58.82 --> 01:54:00.30
you're like, dang, I didn't.

1536
01:54:00.30 --> 01:54:01.14
I didn't.

1537
01:54:01.14 --> 01:54:02.78
I reject feelings.

1538
01:54:02.78 --> 01:54:04.10
Yeah.

1539
01:54:04.10 --> 01:54:06.34
But you know, then you'll fall into certain pitfalls

1540
01:54:06.34 --> 01:54:07.10
because you're like, dang,

1541
01:54:07.10 --> 01:54:09.62
I didn't really expect it to be like this, you know?

1542
01:54:09.62 --> 01:54:13.06
And maybe if you went in there expecting certain things

1543
01:54:13.06 --> 01:54:14.90
or understanding that certain things are gonna come about,

1544
01:54:14.90 --> 01:54:16.94
you have more will.

1545
01:54:16.94 --> 01:54:18.90
So the diet thing, when you change your diet,

1546
01:54:18.90 --> 01:54:21.90
if your diet, let's say your typical diet is poor.

1547
01:54:21.90 --> 01:54:24.66
I mean, typically that's gonna mean it tastes good

1548
01:54:24.66 --> 01:54:25.66
in some way.

1549
01:54:25.66 --> 01:54:29.26
To check whether it be fast food or whatever.

1550
01:54:29.26 --> 01:54:30.26
Just whatever is good.

1551
01:54:30.26 --> 01:54:31.74
Yeah, let's show this.

1552
01:54:31.74 --> 01:54:33.22
Yeah, exactly right.

1553
01:54:33.22 --> 01:54:34.18
So it tastes good.

1554
01:54:34.18 --> 01:54:36.62
And foods that taste good have a certain chemical reaction

1555
01:54:36.62 --> 01:54:39.98
in your brain and they go hand in hand.

1556
01:54:41.18 --> 01:54:42.46
Pleasure, well called pleasure.

1557
01:54:43.42 --> 01:54:47.78
So when you refine your diet, typically that means

1558
01:54:47.78 --> 01:54:49.70
it's gonna be less sugar.

1559
01:54:49.70 --> 01:54:52.06
Sometimes less fat, it depends on what kind of diet,

1560
01:54:52.06 --> 01:54:52.90
you know, you go on.

1561
01:54:52.90 --> 01:54:56.30
But if it's a better diet compared to your junk food diet

1562
01:54:56.30 --> 01:54:57.70
based on taste and pleasure.

1563
01:54:57.70 --> 01:54:58.54
Just taste it.

1564
01:54:58.54 --> 01:54:59.70
Less taste exactly right.

1565
01:54:59.70 --> 01:55:02.42
So it's one thing to be like, okay,

1566
01:55:02.42 --> 01:55:04.86
it doesn't taste as good and I can handle that, that's cool.

1567
01:55:04.86 --> 01:55:08.42
But the chemical reaction in your brain is basically

1568
01:55:08.42 --> 01:55:10.94
gonna be telling you like, you need pleasure.

1569
01:55:10.94 --> 01:55:12.58
You are being deprived of pleasure.

1570
01:55:12.58 --> 01:55:14.06
And you're like, no, they're telling you,

1571
01:55:14.06 --> 01:55:15.66
your brain is telling you it's not just pleasure.

1572
01:55:15.66 --> 01:55:16.62
It's sustenance.

1573
01:55:16.62 --> 01:55:17.62
It's survival.

1574
01:55:17.62 --> 01:55:18.62
It's not me.

1575
01:55:18.62 --> 01:55:19.22
Yes.

1576
01:55:19.22 --> 01:55:22.22
Not just you want, you need that donut.

1577
01:55:22.22 --> 01:55:23.78
Yeah, that was the standard.

1578
01:55:23.78 --> 01:55:24.78
Now you've been standard.

1579
01:55:24.78 --> 01:55:26.10
So we gotta get over that.

1580
01:55:26.10 --> 01:55:28.74
And people call it cravings, that's your craving.

1581
01:55:28.74 --> 01:55:30.66
But it's one thing to be like, okay, craving.

1582
01:55:30.66 --> 01:55:32.70
I can overcome that for a lot of people.

1583
01:55:32.70 --> 01:55:34.94
But it's a weird feeling.

1584
01:55:34.94 --> 01:55:36.42
It goes beyond just it.

1585
01:55:36.42 --> 01:55:38.22
You wanna know a good way to kick things off?

1586
01:55:38.22 --> 01:55:39.54
Going on a fast man.

1587
01:55:39.54 --> 01:55:41.50
Going on a fast, I don't want to fall asleep for our fast

1588
01:55:41.50 --> 01:55:42.42
because I'll tell you what.

1589
01:55:42.42 --> 01:55:45.02
The best thing about going on a fast in my opinion

1590
01:55:45.02 --> 01:55:46.86
is how it recalibrate your,

1591
01:55:46.86 --> 01:55:48.54
it recalibrate two things.

1592
01:55:48.54 --> 01:55:50.94
You're actual feeling of hunger

1593
01:55:50.94 --> 01:55:53.46
and it recalibrates your taste buds too.

1594
01:55:53.46 --> 01:55:54.30
Yeah.

1595
01:55:54.30 --> 01:55:56.14
Because when you're eating this beautiful stuff

1596
01:55:56.14 --> 01:55:58.70
all the time, you're like, that takes so good.

1597
01:55:58.70 --> 01:56:01.30
And you just need more of it.

1598
01:56:01.30 --> 01:56:03.54
Whereas once you go on a fast,

1599
01:56:03.54 --> 01:56:06.62
when you have a glass of water, it tastes good.

1600
01:56:06.62 --> 01:56:08.26
Yeah, I come and say so good.

1601
01:56:08.26 --> 01:56:10.90
And then when you break the fast

1602
01:56:10.90 --> 01:56:13.14
and you have whatever you're gonna have,

1603
01:56:13.14 --> 01:56:15.30
whatever your first meal is,

1604
01:56:15.30 --> 01:56:17.14
it takes really good.

1605
01:56:17.14 --> 01:56:19.62
And it's very satisfying

1606
01:56:19.62 --> 01:56:22.30
because you have an eating thing.

1607
01:56:22.30 --> 01:56:23.46
Yeah, your needs is good.

1608
01:56:23.46 --> 01:56:24.30
Yeah, your needs.

1609
01:56:24.30 --> 01:56:27.42
So that's one of the best things I found about fasting

1610
01:56:27.42 --> 01:56:30.50
is that recalibrates those, those two things.

1611
01:56:30.50 --> 01:56:33.50
Hunger and taste and things start to taste better.

1612
01:56:33.50 --> 01:56:36.46
It's like have you ever,

1613
01:56:36.46 --> 01:56:38.42
the easy, you drink Coca Cola, right?

1614
01:56:38.42 --> 01:56:41.42
So you're used to that sweet, sweet thing.

1615
01:56:41.42 --> 01:56:42.34
Everyone's so strong.

1616
01:56:42.34 --> 01:56:46.34
For me, because I don't drink it, if I taste it,

1617
01:56:46.34 --> 01:56:48.14
it tastes over the top.

1618
01:56:48.14 --> 01:56:50.90
To much sweet, over the top.

1619
01:56:50.90 --> 01:56:54.50
And that's because I've fasted from having Coca Cola

1620
01:56:54.50 --> 01:56:56.98
for so long that it just is a taste

1621
01:56:56.98 --> 01:56:59.22
that I don't even like anymore.

1622
01:56:59.22 --> 01:57:01.38
But there's a middle ground where, hey,

1623
01:57:01.38 --> 01:57:03.14
you can have it and you go, wow, this tastes

1624
01:57:03.14 --> 01:57:05.34
incredibly good.

1625
01:57:05.34 --> 01:57:06.46
But I don't need a ton of it

1626
01:57:06.46 --> 01:57:08.66
because I got the satisfaction of the taste.

1627
01:57:08.66 --> 01:57:10.90
So yeah, that's another good way to kick things off.

1628
01:57:10.90 --> 01:57:13.90
It's going to fast, going to 24 hour fast.

1629
01:57:13.90 --> 01:57:15.14
You don't need food.

1630
01:57:15.14 --> 01:57:16.98
Like I told my daughter was going through

1631
01:57:16.98 --> 01:57:18.62
last wrestling season.

1632
01:57:18.62 --> 01:57:19.98
She was telling me she says, you know, Dad,

1633
01:57:19.98 --> 01:57:21.90
I was thinking, because she's fasting,

1634
01:57:21.90 --> 01:57:23.42
or not fasting, she's cutting weight.

1635
01:57:23.42 --> 01:57:25.34
Never mind, fasting, she's gotten weight.

1636
01:57:25.34 --> 01:57:26.18
Yeah, water.

1637
01:57:26.18 --> 01:57:27.26
And her thing was like, you know,

1638
01:57:27.26 --> 01:57:29.86
if a person can live for 30 days without food,

1639
01:57:29.86 --> 01:57:32.26
I can make it till post weigh-ins.

1640
01:57:32.26 --> 01:57:32.94
Yeah, yeah.

1641
01:57:32.94 --> 01:57:35.62
You know, you're not starving.

1642
01:57:37.62 --> 01:57:38.78
You know, you're cutting weight.

1643
01:57:38.78 --> 01:57:41.62
As big Tony BTF, Tony used to say,

1644
01:57:41.62 --> 01:57:42.82
like you're not going to die.

1645
01:57:42.82 --> 01:57:45.82
Oh, you're going to die.

1646
01:57:45.82 --> 01:57:46.66
Oh, no.

1647
01:57:46.66 --> 01:57:47.66
No.

1648
01:57:47.66 --> 01:57:49.66
So dumb.

1649
01:57:50.66 --> 01:57:52.98
I talked to Tony the other day on the phone.

1650
01:57:52.98 --> 01:57:54.38
He was all fired up.

1651
01:57:54.38 --> 01:57:56.34
We were laughing really hard.

1652
01:57:56.34 --> 01:58:01.34
I was telling a story and he was laughing so hysterically

1653
01:58:02.58 --> 01:58:04.98
that it was hard to understand.

1654
01:58:04.98 --> 01:58:07.26
So yeah.

1655
01:58:07.26 --> 01:58:08.66
Big Tony.

1656
01:58:08.66 --> 01:58:09.86
Yeah, that was his thing.

1657
01:58:09.86 --> 01:58:13.54
Well, you're not going to die if you don't have

1658
01:58:13.54 --> 01:58:15.06
anything right now.

1659
01:58:15.06 --> 01:58:16.26
Yeah, stop.

1660
01:58:16.26 --> 01:58:18.26
See man, that's so that's so dumb.

1661
01:58:18.26 --> 01:58:19.14
Don't watch it, but what?

1662
01:58:19.14 --> 01:58:21.34
When you feel like eating just picture Tony,

1663
01:58:21.34 --> 01:58:25.14
yeah, just picture BTF, Tony, sitting there going,

1664
01:58:25.14 --> 01:58:27.70
you're not going to die if you don't have that.

1665
01:58:27.70 --> 01:58:28.70
So dumb.

1666
01:58:28.70 --> 01:58:29.54
Yeah.

1667
01:58:29.54 --> 01:58:31.38
Just be tougher.

1668
01:58:31.38 --> 01:58:32.74
Yeah, wrong with you.

1669
01:58:32.74 --> 01:58:33.90
Man, that's such a good full.

1670
01:58:33.90 --> 01:58:35.74
I mean, it's real funny when he says it.

1671
01:58:35.74 --> 01:58:39.74
It makes you feel like real push, but he's kind of right.

1672
01:58:39.74 --> 01:58:41.22
You know, it's like you're like, oh my gosh,

1673
01:58:41.22 --> 01:58:42.74
I'm just craving.

1674
01:58:42.74 --> 01:58:44.30
You know, how am I?

1675
01:58:44.30 --> 01:58:45.30
How embarrassing is that?

1676
01:58:45.30 --> 01:58:46.14
Imagine this.

1677
01:58:46.14 --> 01:58:50.62
Imagine if you had to announce your stupid pathetic

1678
01:58:50.62 --> 01:58:53.22
of craving and needs,

1679
01:58:53.22 --> 01:58:55.14
oh my gosh, wants to the world.

1680
01:58:55.14 --> 01:58:55.98
Yeah.

1681
01:58:55.98 --> 01:58:58.82
You know, imagine if I had to walk into a room

1682
01:58:58.82 --> 01:59:00.42
and do a group of people and say,

1683
01:59:00.42 --> 01:59:04.86
I cannot live another second longer without a donut.

1684
01:59:04.86 --> 01:59:08.34
Like that would be so embarrassing as a human to say that.

1685
01:59:08.34 --> 01:59:10.62
And yet we think that way and we act that way.

1686
01:59:10.62 --> 01:59:14.46
We don't say it, but our actions basically act that way.

1687
01:59:14.46 --> 01:59:16.46
We know that the donut is not needed.

1688
01:59:16.46 --> 01:59:16.90
Yeah.

1689
01:59:16.90 --> 01:59:19.02
We know that the donut is not needed.

1690
01:59:19.02 --> 01:59:19.86
Yeah.

1691
01:59:19.86 --> 01:59:24.86
If you were starving for 38 days, you'd have done it.

1692
01:59:26.46 --> 01:59:28.10
If you were on day 37,

1693
01:59:28.10 --> 01:59:30.22
old off, you might find a steak in the meat time.

1694
01:59:30.22 --> 01:59:31.06
Yeah.

1695
01:59:32.06 --> 01:59:33.22
It's so bad.

1696
01:59:33.22 --> 01:59:35.74
And man, you said you mentioned it in a movie thing.

1697
01:59:35.74 --> 01:59:40.74
That it's so bad that this is an official

1698
01:59:40.74 --> 01:59:44.86
effective way to like improve your diet.

1699
01:59:44.86 --> 01:59:46.30
This right here.

1700
01:59:46.30 --> 01:59:48.18
Don't keep junk food in your house.

1701
01:59:48.18 --> 01:59:50.54
You can't control yourself.

1702
01:59:50.54 --> 01:59:52.98
You can't control yourself.

1703
01:59:52.98 --> 01:59:54.62
You rationalize too.

1704
01:59:54.62 --> 01:59:55.62
You know what?

1705
01:59:55.62 --> 01:59:56.46
It's no big deal.

1706
01:59:56.46 --> 01:59:57.46
I'm going to start that.

1707
01:59:57.46 --> 01:59:58.62
I'm going to fast me three weeks anyway.

1708
01:59:58.62 --> 02:00:01.02
So I'm going to just eat this whatever right now.

1709
02:00:01.02 --> 02:00:02.02
That's how bad we are.

1710
02:00:02.02 --> 02:00:03.02
We can't control ourselves.

1711
02:00:03.02 --> 02:00:03.82
I like that idea.

1712
02:00:03.82 --> 02:00:06.58
I just thought of just having to announce your weak thoughts

1713
02:00:06.58 --> 02:00:09.30
to the whole world and how stupid they would.

1714
02:00:09.30 --> 02:00:11.22
Like if you're going to carry out an action that's weak,

1715
02:00:11.22 --> 02:00:13.74
you should have to verbalize it first.

1716
02:00:13.74 --> 02:00:14.10
Yeah.

1717
02:00:14.10 --> 02:00:17.66
I am about to eat this donut because I cannot survive without it.

1718
02:00:17.66 --> 02:00:20.02
It's a naturalization to the world.

1719
02:00:20.02 --> 02:00:20.86
Yeah.

1720
02:00:20.86 --> 02:00:27.10
I'm going to skip this workout because my left pinky is sore

1721
02:00:27.10 --> 02:00:28.86
from jujitsu three weeks ago.

1722
02:00:28.86 --> 02:00:29.86
Yeah.

1723
02:00:29.86 --> 02:00:30.86
No.

1724
02:00:30.86 --> 02:00:32.30
Well, that's just better.

1725
02:00:32.30 --> 02:00:36.06
That's a better rationalization than a lot of ones that I've dealt with.

1726
02:00:36.06 --> 02:00:37.06
I straight up.

1727
02:00:37.06 --> 02:00:38.06
I don't feel like it.

1728
02:00:38.06 --> 02:00:39.06
Straight up.

1729
02:00:39.06 --> 02:00:40.06
That's not good.

1730
02:00:40.06 --> 02:00:42.22
Come on, little.

1731
02:00:42.22 --> 02:00:45.22
Next question.

1732
02:00:45.22 --> 02:00:48.90
CD, PED or HGH question mark.

1733
02:00:48.90 --> 02:00:51.82
That means do you take these or are you.

1734
02:00:51.82 --> 02:00:52.82
Which one is better?

1735
02:00:52.82 --> 02:00:53.82
Yeah.

1736
02:00:53.82 --> 02:00:58.66
Well, PED is a general term performance in enhancing drugs and HGH's human growth.

1737
02:00:58.66 --> 02:01:05.58
I think he's asking or this person is asking if you take them or you're thoughts on them.

1738
02:01:05.58 --> 02:01:11.98
The only performance enhancing drug that I take is jacquaint.

1739
02:01:11.98 --> 02:01:13.42
I take jacquaint now.

1740
02:01:13.42 --> 02:01:18.06
Which being run through the Olympic committee to see it looks like it's going to get banned

1741
02:01:18.06 --> 02:01:19.54
in the Olympics jacquaint.

1742
02:01:19.54 --> 02:01:20.54
Yeah, yeah.

1743
02:01:20.54 --> 02:01:21.54
Be careful.

1744
02:01:21.54 --> 02:01:22.54
Be careful.

1745
02:01:22.54 --> 02:01:23.54
Yeah.

1746
02:01:23.54 --> 02:01:24.54
Tonya, Tonya, Tonya, records are being broken.

1747
02:01:24.54 --> 02:01:25.54
No.

1748
02:01:25.54 --> 02:01:26.54
I don't take anything.

1749
02:01:26.54 --> 02:01:27.54
Never have.

1750
02:01:27.54 --> 02:01:28.54
Yeah.

1751
02:01:28.54 --> 02:01:29.54
V.

1752
02:01:29.54 --> 02:01:32.74
HGH and Mop, PEDs perform.

1753
02:01:32.74 --> 02:01:33.98
What's the performance?

1754
02:01:33.98 --> 02:01:35.58
Performance enhancing drugs steroids, bro.

1755
02:01:35.58 --> 02:01:36.58
Yeah.

1756
02:01:36.58 --> 02:01:41.30
But so let's say technically is caffeine of performance.

1757
02:01:41.30 --> 02:01:42.30
Yeah.

1758
02:01:42.30 --> 02:01:44.50
I think it actually, I don't know.

1759
02:01:44.50 --> 02:01:45.50
I don't know.

1760
02:01:45.50 --> 02:01:46.50
I don't know.

1761
02:01:46.50 --> 02:01:47.50
Well, it is no.

1762
02:01:47.50 --> 02:01:49.50
I do know that it is in a performance enhancing drug.

1763
02:01:49.50 --> 02:01:50.50
It is.

1764
02:01:50.50 --> 02:01:51.50
People take it.

1765
02:01:51.50 --> 02:01:55.14
And when they scientifically measure, it is a performance enhancing drug.

1766
02:01:55.14 --> 02:01:56.54
But I think for some reason it's legal.

1767
02:01:56.54 --> 02:01:57.54
Yeah.

1768
02:01:57.54 --> 02:01:58.54
Even in the Olympics or whatever.

1769
02:01:58.54 --> 02:02:00.62
I don't think you do have a maximum that you can take.

1770
02:02:00.62 --> 02:02:05.94
I don't think you could just, but fill your blood with caffeine and go do your wrestling

1771
02:02:05.94 --> 02:02:06.94
match.

1772
02:02:06.94 --> 02:02:07.94
But.

1773
02:02:07.94 --> 02:02:08.94
But.

1774
02:02:08.94 --> 02:02:09.94
Yeah.

1775
02:02:09.94 --> 02:02:12.22
Yeah, interesting.

1776
02:02:12.22 --> 02:02:13.22
Yeah.

1777
02:02:13.22 --> 02:02:15.22
My, I have this friend called Kiko.

1778
02:02:15.22 --> 02:02:16.86
Kiko Killcoin is his name.

1779
02:02:16.86 --> 02:02:17.86
I call it.

1780
02:02:17.86 --> 02:02:20.26
He was like, I want to say outside linebacker.

1781
02:02:20.26 --> 02:02:21.26
Maybe inside.

1782
02:02:21.26 --> 02:02:22.26
I don't know.

1783
02:02:22.26 --> 02:02:23.26
He's a linebacker.

1784
02:02:23.26 --> 02:02:25.30
So he'd have a real good workout.

1785
02:02:25.30 --> 02:02:27.46
And you know when you workout, you're lifting.

1786
02:02:27.46 --> 02:02:28.90
You'd have a pump, right?

1787
02:02:28.90 --> 02:02:29.90
You know, you walk around.

1788
02:02:29.90 --> 02:02:31.42
So he'd take off his shirt sometimes.

1789
02:02:31.42 --> 02:02:33.22
And he'd be like, like guys, guys.

1790
02:02:33.22 --> 02:02:35.22
I think I'm on steroids.

1791
02:02:35.22 --> 02:02:38.94
Oh, he thought that was the funniest thing.

1792
02:02:38.94 --> 02:02:39.94
Nonetheless, oh, yeah.

1793
02:02:39.94 --> 02:02:42.58
No, no steroids are PD.

1794
02:02:42.58 --> 02:02:44.58
Junko.

1795
02:02:44.58 --> 02:02:45.58
Next.

1796
02:02:45.58 --> 02:02:47.46
Can you believe in aliens?

1797
02:02:47.46 --> 02:02:50.78
I'm assuming they mean extraterrestrial aliens.

1798
02:02:50.78 --> 02:02:52.50
Yeah, I assume they do mean that.

1799
02:02:52.50 --> 02:03:00.70
I, my opinion on aliens is that I'm sure in this vast unknown world and universe, there

1800
02:03:00.70 --> 02:03:06.42
is likely to be other life forms that have some level of intelligence.

1801
02:03:06.42 --> 02:03:08.18
Interesting.

1802
02:03:08.18 --> 02:03:11.46
I'm going to scale from one to ten how sure you are.

1803
02:03:11.46 --> 02:03:12.46
Obviously, you can't be tan.

1804
02:03:12.46 --> 02:03:14.46
Not very.

1805
02:03:14.46 --> 02:03:16.26
I'm over a five.

1806
02:03:16.26 --> 02:03:22.30
But well, actually, when you take the entire universe, which is so massive, we can barely

1807
02:03:22.30 --> 02:03:28.74
even comprehend it, the chances are decent that there's some other somehow intelligent

1808
02:03:28.74 --> 02:03:30.30
life form out there.

1809
02:03:30.30 --> 02:03:34.50
And you almost, I mean, you kind of have to ask, wait, like, at this very time, but

1810
02:03:34.50 --> 02:03:35.50
don't you think about it?

1811
02:03:35.50 --> 02:03:37.14
There's really no time.

1812
02:03:37.14 --> 02:03:39.14
You know, like, that's kind of relative to.

1813
02:03:39.14 --> 02:03:42.14
So, in the whole existence, would you say what?

1814
02:03:42.14 --> 02:03:43.86
Nine, or you level nine, sure?

1815
02:03:43.86 --> 02:03:45.42
This is a nice, that's my out of opinion.

1816
02:03:45.42 --> 02:03:46.42
Don't know.

1817
02:03:46.42 --> 02:03:48.42
I think nine, I think like nine points.

1818
02:03:48.42 --> 02:03:49.98
Oh, so you're a believer.

1819
02:03:49.98 --> 02:03:51.14
Yeah, I'm a believer.

1820
02:03:51.14 --> 02:03:57.66
I would be vast, like if some wizard guy was like, okay, you get to make a bet.

1821
02:03:57.66 --> 02:03:58.78
Do you think there is or isn't?

1822
02:03:58.78 --> 02:03:59.78
I know the answer.

1823
02:03:59.78 --> 02:04:04.30
Do you think there is or isn't, you know, you know, the wizard be proof of concept right

1824
02:04:04.30 --> 02:04:05.30
there.

1825
02:04:05.30 --> 02:04:06.82
Oh, that's your talk until an alien.

1826
02:04:06.82 --> 02:04:08.82
What if you use a guy from the future?

1827
02:04:08.82 --> 02:04:09.82
Okay.

1828
02:04:09.82 --> 02:04:10.82
And somehow figured it out.

1829
02:04:10.82 --> 02:04:11.82
I don't know.

1830
02:04:11.82 --> 02:04:12.82
They map the whole universe.

1831
02:04:12.82 --> 02:04:16.10
I don't know, whatever.

1832
02:04:16.10 --> 02:04:17.10
I would bet.

1833
02:04:17.10 --> 02:04:19.78
Yeah, the cost is your life, too, by the way.

1834
02:04:19.78 --> 02:04:20.78
You have to make a bet.

1835
02:04:20.78 --> 02:04:21.78
You have to make a choice.

1836
02:04:21.78 --> 02:04:24.18
And if you get it right, you live.

1837
02:04:24.18 --> 02:04:25.18
You get it wrong.

1838
02:04:25.18 --> 02:04:26.18
You die.

1839
02:04:26.18 --> 02:04:27.18
I would bet.

1840
02:04:27.18 --> 02:04:28.18
Yes.

1841
02:04:28.18 --> 02:04:29.18
I would bet.

1842
02:04:29.18 --> 02:04:30.18
Yes.

1843
02:04:30.18 --> 02:04:31.18
I would bet.

1844
02:04:31.18 --> 02:04:32.18
Yes.

1845
02:04:32.18 --> 02:04:36.78
The thing is, is you would also be interesting to have a scientist.

1846
02:04:36.78 --> 02:04:47.40
Or talk to a scientist about the probability of human life like how incredibly tiny, tiny,

1847
02:04:47.40 --> 02:04:50.50
tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, just like all the little things that had to happen first

1848
02:04:50.50 --> 02:04:51.50
to end up here.

1849
02:04:51.50 --> 02:04:52.50
Yeah.

1850
02:04:52.50 --> 02:04:53.50
And it's okay for them to happen again.

1851
02:04:53.50 --> 02:04:54.50
Oh, yeah, to happen again.

1852
02:04:54.50 --> 02:05:00.74
But then again, you compare that to the unknown, one of this universe that is so large,

1853
02:05:00.74 --> 02:05:01.74
it's incomprehensible.

1854
02:05:01.74 --> 02:05:02.74
Yeah.

1855
02:05:02.74 --> 02:05:03.74
Chances are it's happened somewhere.

1856
02:05:03.74 --> 02:05:04.74
Yeah.

1857
02:05:04.74 --> 02:05:10.46
Even just in a way, a different point where it's like, you know, what would it take to make

1858
02:05:10.46 --> 02:05:15.18
humans and wind up being humans?

1859
02:05:15.18 --> 02:05:24.06
If you look at it backwards, it seems really like, oh my gosh, this is this crazy, you know,

1860
02:05:24.06 --> 02:05:25.06
almost impossible.

1861
02:05:25.06 --> 02:05:26.06
It's a little percentage.

1862
02:05:26.06 --> 02:05:28.06
Yeah, miracle kind of thing.

1863
02:05:28.06 --> 02:05:30.74
But you can say that with everyday thing.

1864
02:05:30.74 --> 02:05:31.74
If you look at it backwards.

1865
02:05:31.74 --> 02:05:35.30
So like let's say I had it like, Legos, right?

1866
02:05:35.30 --> 02:05:37.54
Okay, we had this big bucket of Legos.

1867
02:05:37.54 --> 02:05:40.30
It was more than one of those big plastic tubs.

1868
02:05:40.30 --> 02:05:46.14
It was just full of years and years and years of Lego sets and there's all in there.

1869
02:05:46.14 --> 02:05:53.22
If I were to take that tub full Legos and fucking pour it out on the ground on a marble

1870
02:05:53.22 --> 02:05:55.78
surface so they scatter everywhere.

1871
02:05:55.78 --> 02:06:00.62
And then it'll, you know, when they all settle, it'll be a little pattern, right?

1872
02:06:00.62 --> 02:06:08.02
So Lego's various color shapes sizes, all kinds of different places, spaces, and to take

1873
02:06:08.02 --> 02:06:16.26
that exact pattern down to the nanometer that exact pattern can be like this is the most

1874
02:06:16.26 --> 02:06:21.58
special pattern in the entire world ever in existence.

1875
02:06:21.58 --> 02:06:27.50
This one is there is no way you'd, anyone ever, ever, could recreate this exact pattern

1876
02:06:27.50 --> 02:06:28.90
down to the nanometer.

1877
02:06:28.90 --> 02:06:29.90
It's impossible.

1878
02:06:29.90 --> 02:06:32.50
That's why this pattern is so special.

1879
02:06:32.50 --> 02:06:37.90
But it's just one of many potential eventualities, really infinite, you know?

1880
02:06:37.90 --> 02:06:44.22
And when you end up at something and then say okay that what we have to end up as special,

1881
02:06:44.22 --> 02:06:46.30
that's looking at it backwards like I said.

1882
02:06:46.30 --> 02:06:51.30
So it's like the lottery winner, you know, the guy who wins the lottery, he's like oh my gosh,

1883
02:06:51.30 --> 02:06:55.54
I'm so special, I want to let no freaking, if I took a ping pong ball and I saw in a

1884
02:06:55.54 --> 02:07:01.62
head a, a mosh pit of one million people, a one ping pong ball, I throw it in the mosh pit

1885
02:07:01.62 --> 02:07:02.98
and then somebody catches it.

1886
02:07:02.98 --> 02:07:06.62
Oh my gosh, I'm so special, but someone's going to get it, someone's going to get the

1887
02:07:06.62 --> 02:07:07.62
ping pong ball.

1888
02:07:07.62 --> 02:07:08.62
That's affirmative.

1889
02:07:08.62 --> 02:07:09.62
Yeah.

1890
02:07:09.62 --> 02:07:14.02
So it doesn't make it necessarily special unless you look at it backwards, you know?

1891
02:07:14.02 --> 02:07:18.78
If that guy's like I'm going to go into another one of the other alien life form could

1892
02:07:18.78 --> 02:07:22.30
be something that we could barely even imagine of what it's like.

1893
02:07:22.30 --> 02:07:27.26
And that that that probability wise is what it is or it's going to be something like so

1894
02:07:27.26 --> 02:07:28.26
small.

1895
02:07:28.26 --> 02:07:29.26
Yeah.

1896
02:07:29.26 --> 02:07:32.82
But if it's like more a superior intelligence, it's going to be something we don't recognize.

1897
02:07:32.82 --> 02:07:38.22
The same way like if you have a caterpillar on a leaf and I see it from 10 yards away.

1898
02:07:38.22 --> 02:07:40.42
I see that little caterpillar right there.

1899
02:07:40.42 --> 02:07:44.46
Hey caterpillar, yelling at it, you know, vibrations from my voice are hitting it.

1900
02:07:44.46 --> 02:07:47.86
Hey caterpillar, the caterpillar has no idea that you even exist.

1901
02:07:47.86 --> 02:07:49.02
Doesn't even know what a human is.

1902
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:52.94
Doesn't know about your problems, doesn't know about your podcast, you know?

1903
02:07:52.94 --> 02:07:54.46
Meanwhile, you know a lot about your podcast.

1904
02:07:54.46 --> 02:07:56.46
You know, it doesn't listen to the podcast.

1905
02:07:56.46 --> 02:07:58.66
I can say with a fair amount of certainty.

1906
02:07:58.66 --> 02:08:00.66
And you know, I don't know, maybe he does.

1907
02:08:00.66 --> 02:08:01.66
I don't know.

1908
02:08:01.66 --> 02:08:03.94
He has big butterfly plans.

1909
02:08:03.94 --> 02:08:05.94
So it's future.

1910
02:08:05.94 --> 02:08:08.38
Jockel.

1911
02:08:08.38 --> 02:08:09.38
Next question.

1912
02:08:09.38 --> 02:08:10.38
Next question.

1913
02:08:10.38 --> 02:08:11.74
How can I incur it?

1914
02:08:11.74 --> 02:08:13.74
Bro, we'll get talk more about aliens.

1915
02:08:13.74 --> 02:08:15.74
They'll be having more about aliens or Legos.

1916
02:08:15.74 --> 02:08:16.74
I'm telling you.

1917
02:08:16.74 --> 02:08:17.74
Lego patterns.

1918
02:08:17.74 --> 02:08:20.74
Because you know, when people see UFOs, they go straight to eat.

1919
02:08:20.74 --> 02:08:22.18
That's an alien.

1920
02:08:22.18 --> 02:08:24.18
Even though it's an undenified, can't do that.

1921
02:08:24.18 --> 02:08:26.30
Remember, was telling you that kids book ideas?

1922
02:08:26.30 --> 02:08:27.30
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1923
02:08:27.30 --> 02:08:28.30
You did tell me about that.

1924
02:08:28.30 --> 02:08:29.30
You didn't tell me again.

1925
02:08:29.30 --> 02:08:31.30
You did go steeper on the telling you.

1926
02:08:31.30 --> 02:08:32.30
I'm telling you.

1927
02:08:32.30 --> 02:08:37.82
It's actually more about the flaws of how people consider or regarding aliens.

1928
02:08:37.82 --> 02:08:39.74
Potentially aliens.

1929
02:08:39.74 --> 02:08:40.94
Jockel.

1930
02:08:40.94 --> 02:08:44.14
How can I encourage a sense of urgency?

1931
02:08:44.14 --> 02:08:45.62
This is hard one.

1932
02:08:45.62 --> 02:08:46.62
And others?

1933
02:08:46.62 --> 02:08:49.94
Yeah, well, yeah, I think I'm assuming that this means with others.

1934
02:08:49.94 --> 02:08:53.94
But for either yourself or others, which you have to realize that time is going by very fast.

1935
02:08:53.94 --> 02:08:58.22
And when you have projects that are due, the minute you look at them, you got to say,

1936
02:08:58.22 --> 02:09:00.42
this is going to take longer than we think it's going to take.

1937
02:09:00.42 --> 02:09:02.34
Let's start moving on it now.

1938
02:09:02.34 --> 02:09:07.26
And then set yourself a really tight timelines to make things happen.

1939
02:09:07.26 --> 02:09:11.18
And that what that'll do is it'll make you realize how far behind the power curve you are.

1940
02:09:11.18 --> 02:09:15.66
That was one of my rules when I was in the seal teams was I was always saying, let's

1941
02:09:15.66 --> 02:09:20.42
be as far ahead of the power curve as possible as we possibly can't.

1942
02:09:20.42 --> 02:09:22.90
So is that a normal expression power curve?

1943
02:09:22.90 --> 02:09:25.74
That's the thing that you're trying to stay ahead of because it's going to smash you.

1944
02:09:25.74 --> 02:09:29.50
So I would always, you know, just we didn't slow down the power curve.

1945
02:09:29.50 --> 02:09:32.46
If we got we thought we were ahead, go ahead further.

1946
02:09:32.46 --> 02:09:37.66
But I always had a really good sense that that power curve was coming across us.

1947
02:09:37.66 --> 02:09:39.78
So that's what you have to do.

1948
02:09:39.78 --> 02:09:41.98
Get as far ahead of it as you can.

1949
02:09:41.98 --> 02:09:42.98
Tell everyone where it is.

1950
02:09:42.98 --> 02:09:46.38
And set some small goals say, oh, you don't think this project's going to take long.

1951
02:09:46.38 --> 02:09:47.22
Okay, cool.

1952
02:09:47.22 --> 02:09:50.46
Let's just finish this first six percent, which means this, this, and this.

1953
02:09:50.46 --> 02:09:53.78
And let's have that done by tomorrow afternoon tomorrow afternoon comes another iron

1954
02:09:53.78 --> 02:09:54.78
even close.

1955
02:09:54.78 --> 02:09:55.78
Okay, guess what?

1956
02:09:55.78 --> 02:09:56.78
We need to do a line.

1957
02:09:56.78 --> 02:09:59.58
We need to get a sense of urgency going so we can get this done.

1958
02:09:59.58 --> 02:10:00.58
That's it.

1959
02:10:00.58 --> 02:10:10.22
I know that to encourage a sense of urgency in yourself, what you can do kind of works.

1960
02:10:10.22 --> 02:10:15.26
Sometimes is you think about the feeling you're going to have after it's done.

1961
02:10:15.26 --> 02:10:17.86
And then consider things that you already did get done.

1962
02:10:17.86 --> 02:10:18.86
You're have those things.

1963
02:10:18.86 --> 02:10:24.82
Well, you're different, but sometimes we, the people have things that man, we need to do.

1964
02:10:24.82 --> 02:10:28.22
And it's just a small thing, you know.

1965
02:10:28.22 --> 02:10:30.46
And like, I'll do it later.

1966
02:10:30.46 --> 02:10:31.46
I'm doing something right now.

1967
02:10:31.46 --> 02:10:32.46
I'll do it.

1968
02:10:32.46 --> 02:10:34.30
You know, tomorrow, yeah, sure.

1969
02:10:34.30 --> 02:10:36.58
That's pretty intuitive to you.

1970
02:10:36.58 --> 02:10:39.14
But you know, sometimes you just feel like doing it later.

1971
02:10:39.14 --> 02:10:42.70
I'm just going to do it later because I'm thinking about something right now or I'm doing

1972
02:10:42.70 --> 02:10:44.06
something right now.

1973
02:10:44.06 --> 02:10:47.62
And then do it now or why are you thinking about doing it?

1974
02:10:47.62 --> 02:10:48.62
Just do it.

1975
02:10:48.62 --> 02:10:49.62
I know.

1976
02:10:49.62 --> 02:10:50.62
Yes.

1977
02:10:50.62 --> 02:10:51.62
I want you to go under your kids all the time.

1978
02:10:51.62 --> 02:10:52.62
Hey, do the dishes.

1979
02:10:52.62 --> 02:10:55.62
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, you don't have to be done.

1980
02:10:55.62 --> 02:10:56.62
I know.

1981
02:10:56.62 --> 02:10:57.62
That's the thing.

1982
02:10:57.62 --> 02:10:58.62
That's the whole point right there.

1983
02:10:58.62 --> 02:11:01.42
So when you do it, when you do the thing, let's say you got to, I don't know, whatever.

1984
02:11:01.42 --> 02:11:03.06
You get a response to an email.

1985
02:11:03.06 --> 02:11:04.06
I don't know.

1986
02:11:04.06 --> 02:11:07.78
And after you do it, that just that feeling right when it's done.

1987
02:11:07.78 --> 02:11:10.78
I'm like, hey, that wasn't taken much.

1988
02:11:10.78 --> 02:11:13.02
That's not going to be case every time.

1989
02:11:13.02 --> 02:11:14.02
But didn't take much.

1990
02:11:14.02 --> 02:11:15.90
And be, I'm done.

1991
02:11:15.90 --> 02:11:19.06
My daddy said this saying, this is what he'd say.

1992
02:11:19.06 --> 02:11:20.50
Do it and it'll be done.

1993
02:11:20.50 --> 02:11:21.50
That's a good saying.

1994
02:11:21.50 --> 02:11:24.70
And as a kid, I was like, oh, dear, it's so smart.

1995
02:11:24.70 --> 02:11:26.10
That's like it is what it is.

1996
02:11:26.10 --> 02:11:27.10
Yeah, I know it is what it is.

1997
02:11:27.10 --> 02:11:28.10
You said that.

1998
02:11:28.10 --> 02:11:29.10
You don't have to say that, you know.

1999
02:11:29.10 --> 02:11:32.02
But what your dad's first name?

2000
02:11:32.02 --> 02:11:34.38
Technically, it's William Charles, junior.

2001
02:11:34.38 --> 02:11:35.38
Okay, what?

2002
02:11:35.38 --> 02:11:36.38
I mean, we have.

2003
02:11:36.38 --> 02:11:40.18
We have a new quote from BC, BC, Alfred Bell Charles.

2004
02:11:40.18 --> 02:11:42.70
Yeah, so BC is in the house.

2005
02:11:42.70 --> 02:11:43.70
No.

2006
02:11:43.70 --> 02:11:44.70
Do it and it is done.

2007
02:11:44.70 --> 02:11:45.70
I like that one.

2008
02:11:45.70 --> 02:11:46.90
Do it and it'll be done.

2009
02:11:46.90 --> 02:11:48.10
Do it and it will be done.

2010
02:11:48.10 --> 02:11:49.10
Yeah.

2011
02:11:49.10 --> 02:11:50.10
I changed it a little bit.

2012
02:11:50.10 --> 02:11:51.10
Do it and it's done.

2013
02:11:51.10 --> 02:11:52.10
Yeah, same thing.

2014
02:11:52.10 --> 02:11:53.10
Same idea.

2015
02:11:53.10 --> 02:11:54.30
But his thing was always, yeah, exactly same thing.

2016
02:11:54.30 --> 02:11:55.30
Earth makes that words.

2017
02:11:55.30 --> 02:11:56.30
BC.

2018
02:11:56.30 --> 02:11:57.90
Do it and it'll be done.

2019
02:11:57.90 --> 02:11:58.90
Yeah.

2020
02:11:58.90 --> 02:12:05.30
At me as a grown adult, arguably, apparently words didn't impact the way you wanted them.

2021
02:12:05.30 --> 02:12:08.50
Now I'm seeing the genius of it, you know, doing it will be done.

2022
02:12:08.50 --> 02:12:10.58
Like you don't have to say good.

2023
02:12:10.58 --> 02:12:12.78
Next question.

2024
02:12:12.78 --> 02:12:18.90
If due to it's not locally available, what would be the next best martial arts choice

2025
02:12:18.90 --> 02:12:20.42
or the next best thing?

2026
02:12:20.42 --> 02:12:23.86
Or is the one way, 70 mile drive worth it?

2027
02:12:23.86 --> 02:12:24.86
Thank you.

2028
02:12:24.86 --> 02:12:26.30
Meaning, it's not locally available.

2029
02:12:26.30 --> 02:12:27.30
It's 70 miles away.

2030
02:12:27.30 --> 02:12:32.50
So yeah, there's a lot of other available martial arts.

2031
02:12:32.50 --> 02:12:34.34
I would say you got due to an wrestling.

2032
02:12:34.34 --> 02:12:37.78
And those exist in a lot of places that due to doesn't exist.

2033
02:12:37.78 --> 02:12:41.78
So wrestling, judo, sombo, those are all good options.

2034
02:12:41.78 --> 02:12:43.06
Great options.

2035
02:12:43.06 --> 02:12:45.18
You can find a catch wrestling school.

2036
02:12:45.18 --> 02:12:46.42
So there's definitely some options.

2037
02:12:46.42 --> 02:12:49.22
Find a good grappling, but a real grappling school.

2038
02:12:49.22 --> 02:12:57.50
What you want to watch out for is a place that says it has karate, kung fu, and jujitsu.

2039
02:12:57.50 --> 02:13:00.18
You want to watch out for that place because that means that guy just put that up there

2040
02:13:00.18 --> 02:13:02.10
because jujitsu is getting popular.

2041
02:13:02.10 --> 02:13:03.50
So watch out for that guy.

2042
02:13:03.50 --> 02:13:07.38
And now one's pretty across the board right there.

2043
02:13:07.38 --> 02:13:11.62
I mean, I can't really imagine many exceptions where it's like, correct.

2044
02:13:11.62 --> 02:13:14.78
All the other ones, and jujitsu, and it's a legitimate jujitsu.

2045
02:13:14.78 --> 02:13:16.02
You don't have to be very often it.

2046
02:13:16.02 --> 02:13:20.06
Now you might have a place that says boxing, wrestling, or unjujitsu.

2047
02:13:20.06 --> 02:13:21.06
Yes, yes, yes.

2048
02:13:21.06 --> 02:13:22.06
Probably legit.

2049
02:13:22.06 --> 02:13:27.10
Because you've got legit boxing, legit wrestling, legit judo, and legit jujitsu.

2050
02:13:27.10 --> 02:13:28.10
So yeah, that's cool.

2051
02:13:28.10 --> 02:13:29.50
That's probably true.

2052
02:13:29.50 --> 02:13:33.46
But when it's non-lidget things, and they throw jujitsu on the end.

2053
02:13:33.46 --> 02:13:39.26
And when ever I'm talking about jujitsu, I'm talking about Brazilian jujitsu.

2054
02:13:39.26 --> 02:13:40.50
I just got to make that clear.

2055
02:13:40.50 --> 02:13:45.14
I'm talking about Brazilian jujitsu, not other forms of jujitsu.

2056
02:13:45.14 --> 02:13:46.14
So be careful of that.

2057
02:13:46.14 --> 02:13:47.74
No, I thought I can't.

2058
02:13:47.74 --> 02:13:52.86
In the spirit of fairness, they're very well could be like, you know, because a lot of these

2059
02:13:52.86 --> 02:13:56.66
guys though, they'll have this vast background and like, Kemple karate.

2060
02:13:56.66 --> 02:13:57.66
You're not in here.

2061
02:13:57.66 --> 02:13:58.66
Some other side.

2062
02:13:58.66 --> 02:13:59.66
And then they, you know, they did.

2063
02:13:59.66 --> 02:14:00.66
Yeah, for sure.

2064
02:14:00.66 --> 02:14:01.66
Yeah, for sure.

2065
02:14:01.66 --> 02:14:05.58
Meanwhile, they're their traditionalists, but they're jujitsu, but it's legit.

2066
02:14:05.58 --> 02:14:07.06
That's why I said, just be careful.

2067
02:14:07.06 --> 02:14:08.06
Yeah, yeah.

2068
02:14:08.06 --> 02:14:09.06
Just be careful.

2069
02:14:09.06 --> 02:14:14.62
And most people, if 15 years ago, they started taking Brazilian jujitsu, and they

2070
02:14:14.62 --> 02:14:25.10
got their black belt, their tai chi, quan, whatever, whatever martial art is not

2071
02:14:25.10 --> 02:14:27.58
at the, on the list of what they teach at their school.

2072
02:14:27.58 --> 02:14:29.30
It's gone, actually.

2073
02:14:29.30 --> 02:14:32.82
If they're a black belt in jujitsu, they're teaching Brazilian jujitsu.

2074
02:14:32.82 --> 02:14:38.82
And they don't say Brazilian jujitsu plus bo-can, quan, or whatever.

2075
02:14:38.82 --> 02:14:39.82
They don't say that.

2076
02:14:39.82 --> 02:14:41.82
They're going to do that.

2077
02:14:41.82 --> 02:14:45.38
And if they do do it, I actually am going to question.

2078
02:14:45.38 --> 02:14:47.42
There are some questions.

2079
02:14:47.42 --> 02:14:48.42
Yeah, sure.

2080
02:14:48.42 --> 02:14:49.42
There's questions.

2081
02:14:49.42 --> 02:14:51.38
Again, can it be, can there be a legit person?

2082
02:14:51.38 --> 02:14:52.38
Yes, there can.

2083
02:14:52.38 --> 02:14:56.86
There are some legit dudes that are, you know, black belts in Brazilian jujitsu.

2084
02:14:56.86 --> 02:15:00.98
And they're a black belt in some other traditional martial art that they took before that.

2085
02:15:00.98 --> 02:15:02.70
That does happen.

2086
02:15:02.70 --> 02:15:08.14
Most of the time, when they realized that the white belt or blue belt in Brazilian jujitsu

2087
02:15:08.14 --> 02:15:11.98
destroyed them and they're martial art that they took over 10 years, they don't put that

2088
02:15:11.98 --> 02:15:13.70
on the list anymore.

2089
02:15:13.70 --> 02:15:17.70
That's why it does to most people.

2090
02:15:17.70 --> 02:15:19.10
So that's why there's questions.

2091
02:15:19.10 --> 02:15:20.10
Yeah, questions.

2092
02:15:20.10 --> 02:15:21.58
There's questions.

2093
02:15:21.58 --> 02:15:23.78
So yeah, wrestling, wrestling.

2094
02:15:23.78 --> 02:15:27.78
I know I'm missing it.

2095
02:15:27.78 --> 02:15:29.78
I apologize.

2096
02:15:29.78 --> 02:15:34.90
I've got folks out there from missing, but wrestling, judo, sombo, catch wrestling.

2097
02:15:34.90 --> 02:15:41.94
Those net now, if there's no kind of grappling, then you boxing, moitai, that's your

2098
02:15:41.94 --> 02:15:42.94
next-to-option.

2099
02:15:42.94 --> 02:15:43.94
So that you're still learning how to fight.

2100
02:15:43.94 --> 02:15:46.74
You just don't get in the groundwork and you definitely want to get the groundwork at

2101
02:15:46.74 --> 02:15:48.22
some point.

2102
02:15:48.22 --> 02:15:49.22
So.

2103
02:15:49.22 --> 02:15:51.78
And then the question on the 70 mile drive, I get this a lot too.

2104
02:15:51.78 --> 02:15:54.90
Some people, they have no martial art in their area.

2105
02:15:54.90 --> 02:15:57.66
And they have a martial, they have jujitsu 70 miles away.

2106
02:15:57.66 --> 02:15:58.66
What should I do?

2107
02:15:58.66 --> 02:16:03.58
My vote in that situation is get some mats at your house, get two or three of your friends

2108
02:16:03.58 --> 02:16:05.22
that want to learn how to fight.

2109
02:16:05.22 --> 02:16:06.62
Start watching YouTube videos.

2110
02:16:06.62 --> 02:16:10.90
And once a week on the Saturday, go down to that jujitsu school.

2111
02:16:10.90 --> 02:16:21.10
When we were training at back at Fabio's, they lived somewhere in the desert of Southern

2112
02:16:21.10 --> 02:16:22.98
California, there was no jujitsu.

2113
02:16:22.98 --> 02:16:27.02
They worked nine to five and then on Saturday, they come out and train.

2114
02:16:27.02 --> 02:16:28.02
And that's what they got.

2115
02:16:28.02 --> 02:16:31.62
And they go home and work on their drills with their three guys that they were driving

2116
02:16:31.62 --> 02:16:33.42
80 miles to come and train on the weekends.

2117
02:16:33.42 --> 02:16:36.82
So yeah, that's a method of doing it too.

2118
02:16:36.82 --> 02:16:42.26
You can train on your own with your buddies on the mats that you get and watching YouTube.

2119
02:16:42.26 --> 02:16:47.10
Or whatever online mechanism you want to use.

2120
02:16:47.10 --> 02:16:51.30
And then once a week you come and you make the track and you learn and you get to train

2121
02:16:51.30 --> 02:16:53.18
with other people and you see where you're at.

2122
02:16:53.18 --> 02:16:54.18
Yeah, thank you.

2123
02:16:54.18 --> 02:16:55.18
That's good.

2124
02:16:55.18 --> 02:16:56.18
Very good.

2125
02:16:56.18 --> 02:17:01.34
Yeah, the next best thing is a heart, I guess it's a total matter of opinion.

2126
02:17:01.34 --> 02:17:10.54
But I feel like wrestling, like if you went, like wrestling is like a really good tool.

2127
02:17:10.54 --> 02:17:11.78
It depends on what you're doing.

2128
02:17:11.78 --> 02:17:13.18
Like why you're doing it.

2129
02:17:13.18 --> 02:17:14.18
Yeah.

2130
02:17:14.18 --> 02:17:15.18
Yeah.

2131
02:17:15.18 --> 02:17:17.42
And wrestling is awesome.

2132
02:17:17.42 --> 02:17:18.42
Yeah.

2133
02:17:18.42 --> 02:17:20.62
I know that that's the best thing is awesome.

2134
02:17:20.62 --> 02:17:26.10
Wrestling is gives you such a massive advantage, not only in Jiu Jitsu, but in life.

2135
02:17:26.10 --> 02:17:27.10
Yeah.

2136
02:17:27.10 --> 02:17:28.10
It gives you an advantage.

2137
02:17:28.10 --> 02:17:30.46
So wrestling is awesome.

2138
02:17:30.46 --> 02:17:35.38
That being said, judo is awesome too.

2139
02:17:35.38 --> 02:17:40.74
And if you train, but there's a more of a variation in judo schools, right?

2140
02:17:40.74 --> 02:17:44.38
And a high end judo school, those people are awesome.

2141
02:17:44.38 --> 02:17:46.58
And that's a great martial art.

2142
02:17:46.58 --> 02:17:49.54
And you learn groundwork, you learn take downs.

2143
02:17:49.54 --> 02:17:51.78
It's a great martial art.

2144
02:17:51.78 --> 02:17:54.78
No question about it.

2145
02:17:54.78 --> 02:17:57.62
There are some weak judo schools though.

2146
02:17:57.62 --> 02:18:03.50
Jiu Jitsu has a little bit of a tendency to sometimes judo people can adapt some of the traditional

2147
02:18:03.50 --> 02:18:10.38
martial arts, traditional martial arts, attitude, including the attitude of, we're not

2148
02:18:10.38 --> 02:18:11.38
actually training.

2149
02:18:11.38 --> 02:18:12.70
And so that has happened.

2150
02:18:12.70 --> 02:18:16.22
But that's less that doesn't happen very often.

2151
02:18:16.22 --> 02:18:19.70
So yeah, if you can find a good judo, the way you find it's good judo school, go and

2152
02:18:19.70 --> 02:18:23.74
put on a key and say, let's fight or let me train with you.

2153
02:18:23.74 --> 02:18:27.30
And they're going to put you just, they're going to take it down and be able to work you

2154
02:18:27.30 --> 02:18:28.30
over.

2155
02:18:28.30 --> 02:18:29.30
That's what judo is.

2156
02:18:29.30 --> 02:18:30.94
Jiu Jitsu is very similar to judo.

2157
02:18:30.94 --> 02:18:33.22
Very similar to judo.

2158
02:18:33.22 --> 02:18:34.62
So judo is a great thing to have.

2159
02:18:34.62 --> 02:18:36.38
Wrestling is a great thing to have.

2160
02:18:36.38 --> 02:18:37.38
For sure.

2161
02:18:37.38 --> 02:18:43.62
Awesome.

2162
02:18:43.62 --> 02:18:45.26
So sambos great.

2163
02:18:45.26 --> 02:18:46.26
Same with catch wrestling.

2164
02:18:46.26 --> 02:18:50.62
Again, there's catch wrestling is a little less with catch wrestling.

2165
02:18:50.62 --> 02:18:56.02
You're a little bit more apt to find something that doesn't actually know what they're doing.

2166
02:18:56.02 --> 02:18:57.62
And so you have to be careful of that.

2167
02:18:57.62 --> 02:19:00.50
There's some phenomenal catch wrestling schools though.

2168
02:19:00.50 --> 02:19:07.50
For sure.

2169
02:19:07.50 --> 02:19:09.26
I think we've got time to look at them more of these.

2170
02:19:09.26 --> 02:19:10.26
Yes.

2171
02:19:10.26 --> 02:19:12.90
Jucco.

2172
02:19:12.90 --> 02:19:17.54
How do I get the desire to have discipline?

2173
02:19:17.54 --> 02:19:27.46
How do I get the desire to have discipline?

2174
02:19:27.46 --> 02:19:30.46
I keep getting asked this type of question.

2175
02:19:30.46 --> 02:19:31.82
How do I get discipline?

2176
02:19:31.82 --> 02:19:33.46
Or how do I want discipline?

2177
02:19:33.46 --> 02:19:36.70
Or how do I maintain discipline?

2178
02:19:36.70 --> 02:19:44.38
And the answer, it's a simple answer, but obviously it's not easy.

2179
02:19:44.38 --> 02:19:49.98
And there's all kinds of tricks and methods that people talk about.

2180
02:19:49.98 --> 02:19:53.58
And they have some merit.

2181
02:19:53.58 --> 02:19:55.34
You know, maybe they do work.

2182
02:19:55.34 --> 02:19:59.58
Because these things, you know, do the little things people say and wake up early.

2183
02:19:59.58 --> 02:20:07.42
I say that and write things down and take cold showers and tell everyone what you're going

2184
02:20:07.42 --> 02:20:08.42
to do.

2185
02:20:08.42 --> 02:20:16.02
So broadcast it and make promises or make bets with your friends of something that you don't

2186
02:20:16.02 --> 02:20:17.50
want to lose.

2187
02:20:17.50 --> 02:20:20.74
And those things, those ideas, they're cool.

2188
02:20:20.74 --> 02:20:22.74
I'm sure they're going to have some impact.

2189
02:20:22.74 --> 02:20:28.62
And if they work for you, that's awesome.

2190
02:20:28.62 --> 02:20:34.82
But the fact of the matter is that the reason discipline is hard to maintain is because

2191
02:20:34.82 --> 02:20:39.22
it is hard to maintain.

2192
02:20:39.22 --> 02:20:41.30
That's what makes discipline hard.

2193
02:20:41.30 --> 02:20:44.30
It's hard.

2194
02:20:44.30 --> 02:20:54.58
And if you hear me claim that discipline is easy for me, then straight up, that's just

2195
02:20:54.58 --> 02:20:56.46
my ego talking.

2196
02:20:56.46 --> 02:20:57.98
That's what that is.

2197
02:20:57.98 --> 02:21:06.54
Because I'm unfortunately just as human as everyone else.

2198
02:21:06.54 --> 02:21:09.50
And it is work to maintain the discipline.

2199
02:21:09.50 --> 02:21:10.50
That's what it is.

2200
02:21:10.50 --> 02:21:21.98
Like holding the line, maintaining the standard, giving no slack, none.

2201
02:21:21.98 --> 02:21:25.10
That's the discipline.

2202
02:21:25.10 --> 02:21:30.38
That's the discipline and it is hard.

2203
02:21:30.38 --> 02:21:40.10
And if there's one thing I would say that does make it easier, it's to envision what it feels

2204
02:21:40.10 --> 02:21:42.62
like when you're done.

2205
02:21:42.62 --> 02:21:49.70
What it feels like after you've worked out or you've held the line on your food intake

2206
02:21:49.70 --> 02:21:59.94
or you've pushed through some monotonous project that you have to do and all those things.

2207
02:21:59.94 --> 02:22:04.34
When they're done, they feel good.

2208
02:22:04.34 --> 02:22:13.34
And contrary to that, envision what you will feel like later when you let the discipline

2209
02:22:13.34 --> 02:22:18.74
slack, you know the feeling.

2210
02:22:18.74 --> 02:22:28.74
Feeling weak and defeated and you know that you're falling behind.

2211
02:22:28.74 --> 02:22:35.74
So get to know those two different types of feelings and ask yourself which one you want

2212
02:22:35.74 --> 02:22:42.42
to feel in 10 minutes or in a half an hour.

2213
02:22:42.42 --> 02:22:53.18
When the thing is done, when the discipline has been implemented, remember what that feels

2214
02:22:53.18 --> 02:23:00.30
like and then remember that those minutes and those hours they turn into weeks and months

2215
02:23:00.30 --> 02:23:07.54
and years and holding the line in those critical minutes will put you in an infinitely

2216
02:23:07.54 --> 02:23:18.06
better place physically and mentally if you maintain the discipline.

2217
02:23:18.06 --> 02:23:28.28
So work through the weakness, fight through the temptation, hold the line, hold the

2218
02:23:28.28 --> 02:23:31.34
line, maintain the discipline.

2219
02:23:31.34 --> 02:23:41.34
It is not easy, but it is worth it.

2220
02:23:41.34 --> 02:23:53.18
Because yes, because discipline equals freedom.

2221
02:23:53.18 --> 02:23:58.74
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2222
02:23:58.74 --> 02:24:08.14
So echo, speaking of discipline, perhaps in a discipline manner, you could explain to us

2223
02:24:08.14 --> 02:24:15.14
how we could support this podcast if we wanted to.

2224
02:24:15.14 --> 02:24:21.98
I feel like we should, like we always do in a disciplined way, talk about it.

2225
02:24:21.98 --> 02:24:24.34
Discipline, I mean concise, by the way.

2226
02:24:24.34 --> 02:24:26.98
Oh, okay, I don't know about that.

2227
02:24:26.98 --> 02:24:31.02
Or over two, remember half hours or something like that.

2228
02:24:31.02 --> 02:24:32.02
Something like this, sure.

2229
02:24:32.02 --> 02:24:33.02
Okay.

2230
02:24:33.02 --> 02:24:34.02
That doesn't control.

2231
02:24:34.02 --> 02:24:35.02
That doesn't play in the earhead.

2232
02:24:35.02 --> 02:24:39.06
You're in the game, you're here to get your job but you care longer takes.

2233
02:24:39.06 --> 02:24:42.06
Correct.

2234
02:24:42.06 --> 02:24:47.46
Nonetheless, last time I mentioned that I ran out of krill oil, you even said you should

2235
02:24:47.46 --> 02:24:49.10
go to the store and buy some.

2236
02:24:49.10 --> 02:24:50.10
Yeah.

2237
02:24:50.10 --> 02:24:51.10
Did you?

2238
02:24:51.10 --> 02:24:52.10
No.

2239
02:24:52.10 --> 02:24:55.74
The good thing is when I went home from our session, you did come in.

2240
02:24:55.74 --> 02:24:56.74
Oh, a lot of ways.

2241
02:24:56.74 --> 02:24:57.74
Thankfully.

2242
02:24:57.74 --> 02:24:58.74
Be orangutane.

2243
02:24:58.74 --> 02:25:02.74
Oh, you got to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

2244
02:25:02.74 --> 02:25:03.74
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.

2245
02:25:03.74 --> 02:25:04.74
Or just one.

2246
02:25:04.74 --> 02:25:05.74
One.

2247
02:25:05.74 --> 02:25:06.74
What's the weight?

2248
02:25:06.74 --> 02:25:07.74
54 pounds.

2249
02:25:07.74 --> 02:25:08.74
You need another one.

2250
02:25:08.74 --> 02:25:10.74
Yeah, so I want the zombie one.

2251
02:25:10.74 --> 02:25:11.74
That's right.

2252
02:25:11.74 --> 02:25:15.02
For whatever, the ring ting ones cool, but this zombie one was really cool.

2253
02:25:15.02 --> 02:25:17.90
So they're out of them.

2254
02:25:17.90 --> 02:25:19.30
I think they're the same weight.

2255
02:25:19.30 --> 02:25:21.50
54, so I want 250, fours they're out of them.

2256
02:25:21.50 --> 02:25:25.26
So I was like, yeah, I'll just get one of these, just, you know, as a one off and then

2257
02:25:25.26 --> 02:25:27.10
one that's on the one's come in.

2258
02:25:27.10 --> 02:25:28.10
Check.

2259
02:25:28.10 --> 02:25:29.42
I'll get the two zombie ones.

2260
02:25:29.42 --> 02:25:30.74
So where's this store?

2261
02:25:30.74 --> 02:25:35.42
The other thing is that on it.com, but I'm explaining what it is just, excuse me,

2262
02:25:35.42 --> 02:25:40.06
put on, oh no, or they don't understand the importance.

2263
02:25:40.06 --> 02:25:41.06
I think it's important.

2264
02:25:41.06 --> 02:25:43.06
Nonetheless, Krill Oil came in.

2265
02:25:43.06 --> 02:25:44.06
This is what you do.

2266
02:25:44.06 --> 02:25:47.90
And I mentioned this before, and this is what I'm going to do.

2267
02:25:47.90 --> 02:25:49.06
I'm going to try to do.

2268
02:25:49.06 --> 02:25:52.06
I should just do it and it'll be done.

2269
02:25:52.06 --> 02:25:53.06
Stay on it.

2270
02:25:53.06 --> 02:25:54.82
You know what that is, right?

2271
02:25:54.82 --> 02:25:55.82
Stay on it.

2272
02:25:55.82 --> 02:25:56.82
Oh, the automatic.

2273
02:25:56.82 --> 02:25:57.82
Yeah, the re.

2274
02:25:57.82 --> 02:25:58.82
Oh, yeah.

2275
02:25:58.82 --> 02:25:59.82
What do you even call it?

2276
02:25:59.82 --> 02:26:01.82
Three automatic automatic.

2277
02:26:01.82 --> 02:26:04.82
Automated shipment.

2278
02:26:04.82 --> 02:26:06.82
Yeah, you just pay every month and they're automatic.

2279
02:26:06.82 --> 02:26:07.82
Yeah, yeah.

2280
02:26:07.82 --> 02:26:09.42
I think you might even get a deal in that one.

2281
02:26:09.42 --> 02:26:11.22
I don't know though, but that's what I'm going to do.

2282
02:26:11.22 --> 02:26:12.42
I'm a status called stay on it.

2283
02:26:12.42 --> 02:26:13.42
Yeah.

2284
02:26:13.42 --> 02:26:14.42
You know what, man?

2285
02:26:14.42 --> 02:26:17.10
That's, and a lot of people or companies do that.

2286
02:26:17.10 --> 02:26:19.82
You know, like to, you know, you do it on Amazon.

2287
02:26:19.82 --> 02:26:20.82
That was stuff.

2288
02:26:20.82 --> 02:26:22.46
Yeah, I was on like to toilet free.

2289
02:26:22.46 --> 02:26:26.82
So you know things that you just use all duct tape, duct constantly running out of that.

2290
02:26:26.82 --> 02:26:27.82
Yeah.

2291
02:26:27.82 --> 02:26:30.82
That's a good deal.

2292
02:26:30.82 --> 02:26:34.82
I mean, that's a good thing to do with basically everything.

2293
02:26:34.82 --> 02:26:37.82
About one time when I was drinking.

2294
02:26:37.82 --> 02:26:40.82
Rock, I'm not drinking anymore.

2295
02:26:40.82 --> 02:26:41.82
Hardly.

2296
02:26:41.82 --> 02:26:42.82
Who was it?

2297
02:26:42.82 --> 02:26:43.82
It was Rudy.

2298
02:26:43.82 --> 02:26:46.82
He asked me to do something of video or something.

2299
02:26:46.82 --> 02:26:47.82
I don't know.

2300
02:26:47.82 --> 02:26:49.82
And he was like, hey, can I pay you in vodka?

2301
02:26:49.82 --> 02:26:52.82
And I was like, I got a savage.

2302
02:26:52.82 --> 02:26:53.82
He even says that.

2303
02:26:53.82 --> 02:26:54.82
I know, Rob Rudy.

2304
02:26:54.82 --> 02:26:56.82
Anyway, and he goes, can I pay you in vodka?

2305
02:26:56.82 --> 02:26:58.82
I didn't tell him to get out of here.

2306
02:26:58.82 --> 02:27:00.82
I was, I was considered outside.

2307
02:27:00.82 --> 02:27:01.82
Wait a second.

2308
02:27:01.82 --> 02:27:04.82
It kind of is like currency when you drink every day.

2309
02:27:04.82 --> 02:27:07.82
You know, it's kind of like, I'm going to spend that money anyway.

2310
02:27:07.82 --> 02:27:08.82
So I'm like, hey, you know what I could do.

2311
02:27:08.82 --> 02:27:11.82
I'm just thinking about it lasted for like five seconds.

2312
02:27:11.82 --> 02:27:13.82
Maybe ten, maybe twenty.

2313
02:27:13.82 --> 02:27:18.82
But I thought to myself, hmm, think of how much money I would have charged them.

2314
02:27:18.82 --> 02:27:22.82
Like double liter triple it and get that much worth of vodka.

2315
02:27:22.82 --> 02:27:25.82
Boom, I just saved 75.

2316
02:27:25.82 --> 02:27:27.82
You know, 66%.

2317
02:27:27.82 --> 02:27:29.82
You know what I'm saying?

2318
02:27:29.82 --> 02:27:30.82
Okay, move on.

2319
02:27:30.82 --> 02:27:33.82
Nonetheless, the point still stands.

2320
02:27:33.82 --> 02:27:37.82
If it's, if you don't have to think about it, it just comes.

2321
02:27:37.82 --> 02:27:39.82
Yeah, you don't get to run into this thing.

2322
02:27:39.82 --> 02:27:42.82
Like me where I'm out of cruel oil for one week.

2323
02:27:42.82 --> 02:27:44.82
Actually it was a little less than a week, doesn't matter.

2324
02:27:44.82 --> 02:27:46.82
I won't be out of it at all.

2325
02:27:46.82 --> 02:27:47.82
So yeah, stay on it.

2326
02:27:47.82 --> 02:27:48.82
That's the one.

2327
02:27:48.82 --> 02:27:49.82
Crue oil, strong bone.

2328
02:27:49.82 --> 02:27:51.82
Didn't run out of that, by the way.

2329
02:27:51.82 --> 02:27:52.82
And that's good man.

2330
02:27:52.82 --> 02:27:53.82
That's stuff is good.

2331
02:27:53.82 --> 02:27:54.82
It's weird how.

2332
02:27:54.82 --> 02:27:57.82
I told you right how my shoulder was jacked like the dead.

2333
02:27:57.82 --> 02:27:58.82
Yeah, I don't know.

2334
02:27:58.82 --> 02:27:59.82
Yeah, I don't know.

2335
02:27:59.82 --> 02:28:00.82
To you healthy and I didn't even stop lifting.

2336
02:28:00.82 --> 02:28:03.82
You know how you get 10 and I just, you're like, I got to stop lifting.

2337
02:28:03.82 --> 02:28:05.82
Or lift lighter, you know?

2338
02:28:05.82 --> 02:28:06.82
Sorry.

2339
02:28:06.82 --> 02:28:09.82
Lighter is for suckers.

2340
02:28:09.82 --> 02:28:10.82
Strong bone.

2341
02:28:10.82 --> 02:28:14.82
Stay strong, get rid of the 10 and I just and any bone issues.

2342
02:28:14.82 --> 02:28:16.82
I think if I'm not mistaken, I'm not sure.

2343
02:28:16.82 --> 02:28:18.82
I got to go back on the website.

2344
02:28:18.82 --> 02:28:20.82
I get addicted to that website.

2345
02:28:20.82 --> 02:28:22.82
It's like interesting stuff.

2346
02:28:22.82 --> 02:28:27.82
I think it can delay or stop the onset of osteoporosis.

2347
02:28:27.82 --> 02:28:29.82
I don't want to make that claim.

2348
02:28:29.82 --> 02:28:30.82
I'm not making that claim.

2349
02:28:30.82 --> 02:28:31.82
I don't make it.

2350
02:28:31.82 --> 02:28:34.82
But I'm just saying that's what strong TM does nonetheless.

2351
02:28:34.82 --> 02:28:35.82
Good kettlebells on there.

2352
02:28:35.82 --> 02:28:37.82
Work out stuff.

2353
02:28:37.82 --> 02:28:41.82
Especially if you like like fuck, you know, if you go in bench.

2354
02:28:41.82 --> 02:28:46.82
I don't bench, but if you do a, you know, just repetitious shoulder press.

2355
02:28:46.82 --> 02:28:47.82
I don't know.

2356
02:28:47.82 --> 02:28:49.82
It can get boring.

2357
02:28:49.82 --> 02:28:54.82
But if you're into like interesting type workouts, you know, how like, did you have a

2358
02:28:54.82 --> 02:28:55.82

Yeah, I got on that.

2363
02:29:00.82 --> 02:29:03.82
See, yeah, that's why you work out so much and early in the morning because you're

2364
02:29:03.82 --> 02:29:04.82
out looking forward to it.

2365
02:29:04.82 --> 02:29:05.82
It's all interesting.

2366
02:29:05.82 --> 02:29:09.82
If you're into those interesting workouts and it's cool because you can like look up a bunch of

2367
02:29:09.82 --> 02:29:11.82
workouts just for one kettlebell, you know?

2368
02:29:11.82 --> 02:29:15.82
So Maces and of course they got the, you know, traditional stuff.

2369
02:29:15.82 --> 02:29:20.82
But like they have these metal things.

2370
02:29:20.82 --> 02:29:23.82
I don't know what they are, but it's like, you know, these are for working out.

2371
02:29:23.82 --> 02:29:26.82
So it's like, man, you can't even get bored working out anymore.

2372
02:29:26.82 --> 02:29:27.82
Really?

2373
02:29:27.82 --> 02:29:28.82
When you go in there.

2374
02:29:28.82 --> 02:29:31.82
Anyway, website's interesting too.

2375
02:29:31.82 --> 02:29:34.82
Anyway, this stuff, the supplements are outstanding.

2376
02:29:34.82 --> 02:29:38.82
They do have, um, yeah, I'm gonna say it.

2377
02:29:38.82 --> 02:29:40.82
This nut butter blend.

2378
02:29:40.82 --> 02:29:43.82
Also I got some MCT oil.

2379
02:29:43.82 --> 02:29:44.82
Yeah.

2380
02:29:44.82 --> 02:29:46.82

2381
02:29:46.82 --> 02:29:47.82

02:29:50.82 --> 02:29:54.82
Anyway, I cook with that one and I put it in what?

2385

All kinds of stuff.

2387
02:29:57.82 --> 02:29:58.82
Put it with something.

2388
02:29:58.82 --> 02:29:59.82
It's your MCT.

2389
02:29:59.82 --> 02:30:01.82

Support your health.

2398
02:30:11.82 --> 02:30:16.82
I don't think you should be in a situation anymore.

2399
02:30:16.82 --> 02:30:21.82
Anymore, given the times where to not support your health.

2400
02:30:21.82 --> 02:30:26.82
This really no room for not supporting your health right now.

2401
02:30:26.82 --> 02:30:27.82
All your needs are met.

2402
02:30:27.82 --> 02:30:29.82
You're not going out in like.

2403
02:30:29.82 --> 02:30:31.82
You're not hunting for a fluke.

2404
02:30:31.82 --> 02:30:32.82
Yeah.

2405
02:30:32.82 --> 02:30:35.82
Nonetheless, do that on a.com slash jacco.

2406
02:30:35.82 --> 02:30:40.82
Also, good way to support your brain is to read these books.

2407
02:30:40.82 --> 02:30:42.82
You gene sledge another one from him.

2408
02:30:42.82 --> 02:30:43.82
Trying to marine.

2409
02:30:43.82 --> 02:30:45.82
Also around the floor.

2410
02:30:45.82 --> 02:30:47.82
And a rumor of war.

2411
02:30:47.82 --> 02:30:49.82
And we go on reading it upside down.

2412
02:30:49.82 --> 02:30:50.82
Yeah.

2413
02:30:50.82 --> 02:30:52.82
And we go on.

2414
02:30:52.82 --> 02:30:54.82
Oh, those are powerful books.

2415
02:30:54.82 --> 02:30:56.82
On the website, jacco.com.

2416
02:30:56.82 --> 02:30:57.82
There's a page.

2417
02:30:57.82 --> 02:30:59.82
It's called books from the episode top menu.

2418
02:30:59.82 --> 02:31:00.82
Click on it.

2419
02:31:00.82 --> 02:31:01.82
Boom.

2420
02:31:01.82 --> 02:31:05.82
All the books from all the episodes with the link directly to Amazon.

2421
02:31:05.82 --> 02:31:06.82
You get those books through there.

2422
02:31:06.82 --> 02:31:08.82
That's a good way to support.

2423
02:31:08.82 --> 02:31:11.82
And sometimes I'm clicked through or if you're doing any other kind of shop,

2424
02:31:11.82 --> 02:31:16.82
and just click through our website and get whatever you're going to get,

2425
02:31:16.82 --> 02:31:21.82
including but not limited to these books, duck tapes, duck tapes,

2426
02:31:21.82 --> 02:31:25.82
maybe you need multiple roles, duck tapes,

2427
02:31:25.82 --> 02:31:28.82
but even if there was multiple roles, I think it's still duck tapes.

2428
02:31:28.82 --> 02:31:29.82
Yeah.

2429
02:31:29.82 --> 02:31:32.82
Do you got different types of duck tapes?

2430
02:31:32.82 --> 02:31:34.82
Still no.

2431
02:31:34.82 --> 02:31:36.82
Or paper clips.

2432
02:31:36.82 --> 02:31:39.82
You ever get stuff that you're into getting.

2433
02:31:39.82 --> 02:31:40.82
I've been getting more nice.

2434
02:31:40.82 --> 02:31:42.82
I'm going to bring them in for a whole year.

2435
02:31:42.82 --> 02:31:45.82
We're going Amazon and be like, hey, this is cool.

2436
02:31:45.82 --> 02:31:47.82
And then you know how they show you the little suggestions.

2437
02:31:47.82 --> 02:31:50.82
And then you buy all the suggestions to your done on the next floor.

2438
02:31:50.82 --> 02:31:51.82
Buy all the suggestions.

2439
02:31:51.82 --> 02:31:52.82
No, because I have discipline.

2440
02:31:52.82 --> 02:31:57.82
I mean, so I went on there and I got a flashlight.

2441
02:31:57.82 --> 02:31:59.82
You know how not he's flashlight technology.

2442
02:31:59.82 --> 02:32:00.82
Yes, the flashlight.

2443
02:32:00.82 --> 02:32:01.82
Yes, the flashlight.

2444
02:32:01.82 --> 02:32:02.82
The spreadsheet.

2445
02:32:02.82 --> 02:32:03.82
Not he's back in the day.

2446
02:32:03.82 --> 02:32:04.82
Remember the ones that you had.

2447
02:32:04.82 --> 02:32:07.82
Like a case flashlight, you know, big, but they're big.

2448
02:32:07.82 --> 02:32:09.82
So those were dope as a kid.

2449
02:32:09.82 --> 02:32:11.82
Like if you had that one, you were like the man.

2450
02:32:11.82 --> 02:32:12.82
Yeah, exactly.

2451
02:32:12.82 --> 02:32:13.82
It's some kind of relieving it.

2452
02:32:13.82 --> 02:32:14.82
So like let me get a flashlight.

2453
02:32:14.82 --> 02:32:16.82
Then you look at all the new flashlight.

2454
02:32:16.82 --> 02:32:17.82
Oh, my gosh.

2455
02:32:17.82 --> 02:32:18.82
These are awesome.

2456
02:32:18.82 --> 02:32:19.82
So I'm like, okay, I'm going to buy this.

2457
02:32:19.82 --> 02:32:21.82
I'm buying mag light.

2458
02:32:21.82 --> 02:32:23.82
Like lights are dope because you can hit people with it.

2459
02:32:23.82 --> 02:32:24.82
Yeah.

2460
02:32:24.82 --> 02:32:24.82
Yeah.

2461
02:32:24.82 --> 02:32:26.82
And then you're in the event of having to use it for a weapon.

2462
02:32:26.82 --> 02:32:31.82
So I get one and then I click on it and there's various options

2463
02:32:31.82 --> 02:32:33.82
on the length of it.

2464
02:32:33.82 --> 02:32:35.82
I'm like, oh, so I get the regular one.

2465
02:32:35.82 --> 02:32:37.82
Camel flash from my daughter.

2466
02:32:37.82 --> 02:32:38.82
She's four.

2467
02:32:38.82 --> 02:32:39.82
She likes flashlight.

2468
02:32:39.82 --> 02:32:40.82
Like all kids do.

2469
02:32:40.82 --> 02:32:42.82
I get two for me.

2470
02:32:42.82 --> 02:32:44.82
One for Sarah, too.

2471
02:32:44.82 --> 02:32:45.82
It's a long one.

2472
02:32:45.82 --> 02:32:47.82
It's like a six cell.

2473
02:32:47.82 --> 02:32:49.82
Meaning it takes six batteries so you can imagine how long that

2474
02:32:49.82 --> 02:32:53.82
it's like a straight up baton with a flashlight on it.

2475
02:32:53.82 --> 02:32:57.82
So I got I wind up getting nine flashlight.

2476
02:32:57.82 --> 02:32:59.82
I don't need nine flashlight.

2477
02:32:59.82 --> 02:33:01.82
This is an indication of a total lack of discipline.

2478
02:33:01.82 --> 02:33:02.82
Yeah.

2479
02:33:02.82 --> 02:33:04.82
I hope you did me click through though.

2480
02:33:04.82 --> 02:33:05.82
Yeah.

2481
02:33:05.82 --> 02:33:06.82
Yes, I did.

2482
02:33:06.82 --> 02:33:09.82
And I got a book too, by the way.

2483
02:33:09.82 --> 02:33:11.82
So yeah, sure.

2484
02:33:11.82 --> 02:33:15.82
I lacked Amazon flashlight shopping discipline.

2485
02:33:15.82 --> 02:33:17.82
But I got some cool flashlight.

2486
02:33:17.82 --> 02:33:19.82
There's this technique here.

2487
02:33:19.82 --> 02:33:20.82
I'll show you it.

2488
02:33:20.82 --> 02:33:22.82
You might even know this, but I learned this in Bouncer.

2489
02:33:22.82 --> 02:33:23.82
It's security training.

2490
02:33:23.82 --> 02:33:26.82
And this was a technique that you're this illegal to use.

2491
02:33:26.82 --> 02:33:29.82
You can't use it as security because it's offensive.

2492
02:33:29.82 --> 02:33:30.82
It's not.

2493
02:33:30.82 --> 02:33:35.82
In security use minimum force necessary to affect a whatever to to use

2494
02:33:35.82 --> 02:33:36.82
situation, whatever.

2495
02:33:36.82 --> 02:33:37.82
So this is what it is.

2496
02:33:37.82 --> 02:33:40.82
Let's say this was a flashlight.

2497
02:33:40.82 --> 02:33:43.82
And this is the light part, right?

2498
02:33:43.82 --> 02:33:44.82
Mm-hmm.

2499
02:33:44.82 --> 02:33:48.82
So usually as a lay person, you hold the flashlight like this, right?

2500
02:33:48.82 --> 02:33:48.82
Mm-hmm.

2501
02:33:48.82 --> 02:33:51.82
And you like in law enforcement and stuff like that, they hold it like this.

2502
02:33:51.82 --> 02:33:52.82
Mm-hmm.

2503
02:33:52.82 --> 02:33:53.82
It's kind of up above like that.

2504
02:33:53.82 --> 02:33:55.82
So this is how you hold it.

2505
02:33:55.82 --> 02:33:59.82
So you shouldn't you grip it right there by the head of it

2506
02:33:59.82 --> 02:34:00.82
with light.

2507
02:34:00.82 --> 02:34:02.82
You shine it in the guy's face.

2508
02:34:02.82 --> 02:34:03.82
Correct.

2509
02:34:03.82 --> 02:34:05.82
And be like calm down, calm down, calm down.

2510
02:34:05.82 --> 02:34:06.82
They can't really see you.

2511
02:34:06.82 --> 02:34:07.82
They're just blinded by the lights.

2512
02:34:07.82 --> 02:34:10.82
And they're like, oh, and they hear your voice and calm down, calm down.

2513
02:34:10.82 --> 02:34:13.82
And men, you can get and you flip it around and hit them with it.

2514
02:34:13.82 --> 02:34:17.82
And you get those long mag lights that, if the six sell.

2515
02:34:17.82 --> 02:34:19.82
Full batteries.

2516
02:34:19.82 --> 02:34:20.82
Boom.

2517
02:34:20.82 --> 02:34:21.82
They don't say it coming.

2518
02:34:21.82 --> 02:34:22.82
They don't flinch.

2519
02:34:22.82 --> 02:34:23.82
They don't blink.

2520
02:34:23.82 --> 02:34:24.82
Yeah.

2521
02:34:24.82 --> 02:34:25.82
They don't anything.

2522
02:34:25.82 --> 02:34:26.82
It's just a complete.

2523
02:34:26.82 --> 02:34:28.82
You see light one moment for a split second.

2524
02:34:28.82 --> 02:34:29.82
The light kind of goes down.

2525
02:34:29.82 --> 02:34:30.82
Then you get flash.

2526
02:34:30.82 --> 02:34:32.82
Then you see, yeah, you wake up.

2527
02:34:32.82 --> 02:34:33.82
That's it.

2528
02:34:33.82 --> 02:34:36.82
And man, the video I saw how I'm doing it to somebody else.

2529
02:34:36.82 --> 02:34:42.82
Dang, it's like, you know those eerie, you know like, when you see a person die

2530
02:34:42.82 --> 02:34:43.82
whether it be on video or whatever.

2531
02:34:43.82 --> 02:34:46.82
You get shot and his body just goes limp.

2532
02:34:46.82 --> 02:34:49.82
He doesn't know it's coming nothing but it looked like that.

2533
02:34:49.82 --> 02:34:52.82
He got hit with it so square and so hard and he didn't even flinch.

2534
02:34:52.82 --> 02:34:53.82
It's a real effective thing.

2535
02:34:53.82 --> 02:34:56.82
Don't do it to people.

2536
02:34:56.82 --> 02:34:58.82
Unless they're in your house or something like that.

2537
02:34:58.82 --> 02:35:01.82
Anyway, I digress.

2538
02:35:01.82 --> 02:35:07.82
Also, good way to support is subscribing to the podcast.

2539
02:35:07.82 --> 02:35:12.82
I do in Google, play, Google play, Stitcher.

2540
02:35:12.82 --> 02:35:16.82
All these podcasting providing platforms.

2541
02:35:16.82 --> 02:35:20.82
Also, YouTube technically is a podcast providing platform.

2542
02:35:20.82 --> 02:35:21.82
So, subscribe to that one.

2543
02:35:21.82 --> 02:35:22.82
Here's the thing about YouTube.

2544
02:35:22.82 --> 02:35:24.82
If you don't know already.

2545
02:35:24.82 --> 02:35:28.82
It gives you the added benefit of being able to see the video version.

2546
02:35:28.82 --> 02:35:30.82
Jocos face.

2547
02:35:30.82 --> 02:35:32.82
Talking about these things.

2548
02:35:32.82 --> 02:35:33.82
So, subscribe to that.

2549
02:35:33.82 --> 02:35:34.82
What's on there?

2550
02:35:34.82 --> 02:35:35.82
Other excerpts on there?

2551
02:35:35.82 --> 02:35:38.82
Some enhanced excerpts.

2552
02:35:38.82 --> 02:35:40.82
Is that what we're calling them?

2553
02:35:40.82 --> 02:35:41.82
Sure.

2554
02:35:41.82 --> 02:35:42.82
They enhanced one.

2555
02:35:42.82 --> 02:35:44.82
Put some music on there.

2556
02:35:44.82 --> 02:35:45.82
Right?

2557
02:35:45.82 --> 02:35:46.82
Some b-roll.

2558
02:35:46.82 --> 02:35:47.82
That's what it's called.

2559
02:35:47.82 --> 02:35:48.82
B-roll.

2560
02:35:48.82 --> 02:35:50.82
Anything that's not the actual thing.

2561
02:35:50.82 --> 02:35:51.82
Anyway.

2562
02:35:51.82 --> 02:35:54.82
And also, what did I say? I was going to put on there last time.

2563
02:35:54.82 --> 02:35:56.82
I was going to put on something.

2564
02:35:56.82 --> 02:35:57.82
On YouTube?

2565
02:35:57.82 --> 02:35:58.82
Yeah.

2566
02:35:58.82 --> 02:35:59.82
Some more videos.

2567
02:35:59.82 --> 02:36:00.82
More videos.

2568
02:36:00.82 --> 02:36:01.82
Have more videos.

2569
02:36:01.82 --> 02:36:02.82
Yeah.

2570
02:36:02.82 --> 02:36:03.82
Some more videos.

2571
02:36:03.82 --> 02:36:05.82
It's just a theory at this point.

2572
02:36:05.82 --> 02:36:07.82
But, nonetheless, subscribe and boom.

2573
02:36:07.82 --> 02:36:09.82
You can support that way.

2574
02:36:09.82 --> 02:36:12.82
Also, Jocos is a store.

2575
02:36:12.82 --> 02:36:15.82
It's called Jocos Store.

2576
02:36:15.82 --> 02:36:17.82
What's the website?

2577
02:36:17.82 --> 02:36:19.82
It's an online store.

2578
02:36:19.82 --> 02:36:20.82
Jocosstore.com.

2579
02:36:20.82 --> 02:36:27.82
So, what this has, if you don't already, is T-shirts?

2580
02:36:27.82 --> 02:36:31.82
Who do you think I'm going to put some light hoodies on there?

2581
02:36:31.82 --> 02:36:32.82
Some more time.

2582
02:36:32.82 --> 02:36:34.82
You don't like that idea?

2583
02:36:34.82 --> 02:36:35.82
No.

2584
02:36:35.82 --> 02:36:36.82
Have you heard nothing?

2585
02:36:36.82 --> 02:36:37.82
Yes.

2586
02:36:37.82 --> 02:36:38.82
Have you?

2587
02:36:38.82 --> 02:36:39.82
Have you heard or no, shirt?

2588
02:36:39.82 --> 02:36:40.82
Yes.

2589
02:36:40.82 --> 02:36:41.82
Do we're tank tops?

2590
02:36:41.82 --> 02:36:42.82
Not really.

2591
02:36:42.82 --> 02:36:43.82
You do?

2592
02:36:43.82 --> 02:36:44.82
Yes.

2593
02:36:44.82 --> 02:36:47.82
My wife threw a bunch of mine away about five or seven years ago.

2594
02:36:47.82 --> 02:36:48.82
Because she doesn't know that they all told her.

2595
02:36:48.82 --> 02:36:50.82
No, they were just all old and ready.

2596
02:36:50.82 --> 02:36:52.82
And she threw them away randomly.

2597
02:36:52.82 --> 02:36:53.82
Yeah.

2598
02:36:53.82 --> 02:36:54.82
Which was awesome.

2599
02:36:54.82 --> 02:36:55.82
She's so thrilled.

2600
02:36:55.82 --> 02:36:57.82
She's telling me that she's not cool.

2601
02:36:57.82 --> 02:36:58.82
That's not cool.

2602
02:36:58.82 --> 02:37:01.82
I just wanted to say one of the four things that I still bring up to her.

2603
02:37:01.82 --> 02:37:02.82
No kidding.

2604
02:37:02.82 --> 02:37:04.82
Like, oh, she can't believe how hot it is today.

2605
02:37:04.82 --> 02:37:06.82
I'd be comfortable if I had a tank top.

2606
02:37:06.82 --> 02:37:08.82
I don't have an excuse to threw them away.

2607
02:37:08.82 --> 02:37:11.82
They were all ratty.

2608
02:37:11.82 --> 02:37:12.82
Yeah, no.

2609
02:37:12.82 --> 02:37:15.82
She doesn't like the way you look in those tank tops.

2610
02:37:15.82 --> 02:37:17.82
It's offensive to our sensibility.

2611
02:37:17.82 --> 02:37:19.82
That's cool.

2612
02:37:19.82 --> 02:37:20.82
Yeah, man.

2613
02:37:20.82 --> 02:37:22.82
I'm just saying, you know, stop pointing the finger.

2614
02:37:22.82 --> 02:37:23.82
Start pointing them up.

2615
02:37:23.82 --> 02:37:24.82
Thumb.

2616
02:37:24.82 --> 02:37:25.82
Right?

2617
02:37:25.82 --> 02:37:26.82
That's the expression, right?

2618
02:37:26.82 --> 02:37:27.82
Yeah.

2619
02:37:27.82 --> 02:37:27.82
Yeah, yeah.

2620
02:37:27.82 --> 02:37:28.82
You got to watch out for that.

2621
02:37:28.82 --> 02:37:29.82
Strangely.

2622
02:37:29.82 --> 02:37:30.82
I don't watch out for your tank tops.

2623
02:37:30.82 --> 02:37:31.82
Yeah.

2624
02:37:31.82 --> 02:37:37.82
You know, a point there is someone did say, actually not many people say tank tops would be cool.

2625
02:37:37.82 --> 02:37:40.82
I don't wear tank tops.

2626
02:37:40.82 --> 02:37:42.82
You do apparently.

2627
02:37:42.82 --> 02:37:43.82
Yeah.

2628
02:37:43.82 --> 02:37:45.82
So that's obviously a sore subject.

2629
02:37:45.82 --> 02:37:46.82
Yeah.

2630
02:37:46.82 --> 02:37:47.82
That's also what I do.

2631
02:37:47.82 --> 02:37:49.82
My whole wardrobe with tank tops.

2632
02:37:49.82 --> 02:37:51.82
Bring them back at the gate.

2633
02:37:51.82 --> 02:37:52.82
Ready or not?

2634
02:37:52.82 --> 02:37:53.82
Tank tops.

2635
02:37:53.82 --> 02:37:54.82
Here we come.

2636
02:37:54.82 --> 02:37:55.82
On the left.

2637
02:37:55.82 --> 02:37:56.82
And pre-rattied.

2638
02:37:56.82 --> 02:37:57.82
Yeah, oh, dang.

2639
02:37:57.82 --> 02:37:58.82
Yeah, you know those okay.

2640
02:37:58.82 --> 02:38:00.82
Put them on the sander.

2641
02:38:00.82 --> 02:38:01.82
Yeah.

2642
02:38:01.82 --> 02:38:02.82
On the left.

2643
02:38:02.82 --> 02:38:03.82
Church or cool.

2644
02:38:03.82 --> 02:38:04.82
If you think they're cool, check them out.

2645
02:38:04.82 --> 02:38:05.82
Talks to the store.

2646
02:38:05.82 --> 02:38:06.82
Come on there.

2647
02:38:06.82 --> 02:38:07.82
Check out the shirts.

2648
02:38:07.82 --> 02:38:08.82
This rash guard's on there.

2649
02:38:08.82 --> 02:38:10.82
I think I'm saying obviously just my opinion.

2650
02:38:10.82 --> 02:38:11.82
The rash guard's a cool.

2651
02:38:11.82 --> 02:38:13.82
That's like to me.

2652
02:38:13.82 --> 02:38:15.82
Actually, there's a lot of good things on there.

2653
02:38:15.82 --> 02:38:21.82
things on there, my opinion, but nonetheless shirts on there, they're cool. If you want to support,

2654
02:38:21.82 --> 02:38:27.66
do it that way, go to the website, see if you like something, get something. Hats are coming soon,

2655
02:38:27.66 --> 02:38:35.10
whatever that means, but they'll be here soon. Also, psychological warfare, if you don't know what that is,

2656
02:38:36.38 --> 02:38:40.46
I know you do, but let's say you didn't know what that was here. I'm gonna tell you. It is,

2657
02:38:40.46 --> 02:38:50.78
and now, but with tracks, jococax, jococ saying what, hey, these are the pragmatic,

2658
02:38:50.78 --> 02:38:58.86
logical reasons why you shouldn't slip on your diet or you're waking up early or this is why you should

2659
02:38:58.86 --> 02:39:03.42
not skip to the workout. This is why you shouldn't slack on the workout, like all these little things that

2660
02:39:03.42 --> 02:39:10.30
you'll, the probability of you slacking on certain things in life, or they fluctuate really,

2661
02:39:10.30 --> 02:39:17.10
but in the event of you slacking on something and you need a spot, verbal, verbal, and psychological.

2662
02:39:19.34 --> 02:39:23.82
Get this, check this out, search psychological warfare, jococulwilling, on iTunes, or Amazon

2663
02:39:23.82 --> 02:39:30.06
music, or wherever they sell MP3s, get that, and get a little spot, get a little spot for your

2664
02:39:30.06 --> 02:39:40.38
points of weakness in your, yeah, dirty. I said it, and that helps. Also, you can get jococoyt on Amazon,

2665
02:39:40.38 --> 02:39:46.54
by the way, we talked about it a little bit today. The person said that they drank a couple of

2666
02:39:46.54 --> 02:39:53.02
jococoyt this morning before I left for mustard 0 0 or two, and ended up at mustard 0 0 1.

2667
02:39:53.42 --> 02:39:58.06
Not saying that I've proven jococoyt allows you travel through time and space, but here we are.

2668
02:39:58.06 --> 02:40:02.86
So again, this is a verified purchase review. So this is a person that actually experienced this,

2669
02:40:02.86 --> 02:40:09.98
so we need to keep that in mind. Jococoyt, you get an own Amazon dot com. Also, way the warrior kid,

2670
02:40:11.98 --> 02:40:22.62
book for kids, and possibly adults. I think we're starting to see that. Okay. Here is a review.

2671
02:40:22.62 --> 02:40:27.26
I wish I had read this book before. It gives you an excellent path to a successful,

2672
02:40:27.26 --> 02:40:32.38
fulfilled life. It is very easy, but don't be fooled. It's incredibly deep, too. I think it is great

2673
02:40:32.38 --> 02:40:37.26
for a 10 year old or for an 80 year old as you are never too old or too young to learn the basics

2674
02:40:37.26 --> 02:40:44.94
of an honorable life worth living. Fantastic. 100 stars. So that's pretty cool. Pick up the book.

2675
02:40:44.94 --> 02:40:53.74
It's about how to be better, how to overcome the obstacles that we all face. And it's told through

2676
02:40:53.74 --> 02:41:02.46
the voice of a 10 year old boy, named Mark and his uncle, Uncle Jake, who comes into his life

2677
02:41:03.02 --> 02:41:07.66
to help him overcome some of these obstacles. So there you go. That's where the warrior kid.

2678
02:41:08.46 --> 02:41:14.78
Also, discipline equals freedom, field manual. Editing is complete at this time. So many of these

2679
02:41:14.78 --> 02:41:22.94
questions I get asked all about all the time are laid out in this book. Food, workouts, martial arts,

2680
02:41:24.14 --> 02:41:35.74
and my operating system. What you that I've talked about on this podcast is in the book. In a written

2681
02:41:35.74 --> 02:41:47.74
form, this book is like the podcast that you can read and absorb and refer back to. So the book is

2682
02:41:47.74 --> 02:41:54.86
like the podcast, but you're going to see it's not a normal book. It's not normal. My publisher

2683
02:41:54.86 --> 02:41:58.14
says we've never published anything like this. I don't think there's anything else published

2684
02:41:58.14 --> 02:42:02.54
like this ever. So it's a little different. It's not a regular book. Just like this is an

2685
02:42:02.54 --> 02:42:07.74
regular podcast. Just like what was for you to feel manual. You can preorder it right now. And of

2686
02:42:07.74 --> 02:42:15.58
course, extreme ownership, leadership book is based on what I learned during 20 years in the seal

2687
02:42:15.58 --> 02:42:23.74
teams about leadership and especially from the battle of Ramadi and how to take those lessons

2688
02:42:23.74 --> 02:42:29.10
and apply them to the battlefield, to business and to life wrote that with my brother,

2689
02:42:29.10 --> 02:42:34.38
Lave Babin, who was on the battlefield with me and Ramadi. Also, we have leadership and

2690
02:42:34.38 --> 02:42:41.82
management consulting company. Me, Lave Babin, JP to know Dave Burke, leadership and management

2691
02:42:41.82 --> 02:42:51.66
alignment for your team. If you want that email info at echelonfront.com and finally the

2692
02:42:51.66 --> 02:42:58.62
mustard Austin, Texas, July 13th and 14th, two late sold out. We're done with that one. Not done with it.

2693
02:42:58.62 --> 02:43:02.70
It's still going to happen, but you can't come because it's sold out. No more seats. We were able to

2694
02:43:02.70 --> 02:43:09.10
bump it up a little bit. I think we got to like 320 or 330. But that's it. We were supposed to only

2695
02:43:09.10 --> 02:43:15.66
have 300. And then we rearranged some seats or whatever. So we got it to 320, I think. But that's it.

2696
02:43:15.66 --> 02:43:21.58
We cannot put anyone else in there sold out. So the next shot is back in San Diego, September,

2697
02:43:21.58 --> 02:43:28.62
14th and 15th back. The Ammi hotel on the bay in San Diego. A lot of people from the first

2698
02:43:28.62 --> 02:43:35.10
mustard in San Diego are coming back. And I think that will be awesome to hear from people. Okay,

2699
02:43:35.10 --> 02:43:39.66
you went, you went to the first mustard. You learn some things. Then you brought them back to

2700
02:43:39.66 --> 02:43:44.30
apply them real world. You hit some obstacles. What are the obstacles that you hit? Let's figure

2701
02:43:44.30 --> 02:43:51.50
out how to get around them. That's mustard 004 San Diego California. After that, we're not going

2702
02:43:51.50 --> 02:43:58.78
to go again with a mustard for a while. At least until sometime in 2018, probably once again in the

2703
02:43:58.78 --> 02:44:05.82
spring time, but later in the spring. So beware of that. If you don't come to September, it's going

2704
02:44:05.82 --> 02:44:12.46
to be a while. And until the mustard, if you do want to communicate and hang out a little bit,

2705
02:44:12.46 --> 02:44:16.06
you can find us getting aft. Well, you're not really getting aft. You're not really getting aft.

2706
02:44:16.06 --> 02:44:22.06
You're not getting it. But you can find us typing letters into a keyboard on the interwebs. That's

2707
02:44:22.06 --> 02:44:31.74
right on Twitter, on Instagram and in the Facebook. Oh, ha. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at

2708
02:44:32.62 --> 02:44:39.34
Jocco Willink and thanks for listening and subscribing and supporting and spreading the word.

2709
02:44:39.34 --> 02:44:48.14
But more important thanks for grabbing a hold of the challenges and the struggles in your life

2710
02:44:48.14 --> 02:44:55.50
and learning from them. And then climbing up those challenges like a Jacob's ladder

2711
02:44:57.18 --> 02:45:03.82
and using them to elevate yourself instead of letting them drag you down. And when you get to the top,

2712
02:45:03.82 --> 02:45:13.18
look around and give someone else a hand. Pull them up, tell them what you learned.

2713
02:45:14.22 --> 02:45:20.54
Try to do it in a tactful way, try and teach them and look around and see who can help you and

2714
02:45:20.54 --> 02:45:28.06
teach you and what you can learn from other people. And teach people to overcome challenges the

2715
02:45:28.06 --> 02:45:34.94
same way that you did the same way we all did by learning from our problems and our challenges

2716
02:45:34.94 --> 02:45:43.74
and our struggles. And after we learn from them, we grab them by the throat and get after it.

2717
02:45:43.74 --> 02:45:55.58
So, until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
