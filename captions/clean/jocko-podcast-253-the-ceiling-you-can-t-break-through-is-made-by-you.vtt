00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.04
This is Jockel podcast number 253 with Dave Burke and me, Jockel willing.

2
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:07.36
Good evening Dave.

3
00:00:07.36 --> 00:00:08.36
Good evening.

4
00:00:08.36 --> 00:00:14.40
So last couple of podcasts, 251 with Dave Babin, 252, also Dave Burke.

5
00:00:14.40 --> 00:00:19.20
We're continuing to make our way through this book right here.

6
00:00:19.20 --> 00:00:24.24
Guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark.

7
00:00:24.24 --> 00:00:30.36
Life and I made it up to page 13. Dave and I, last time we made it up to page 28, it's

8
00:00:30.36 --> 00:00:32.72
117 page book.

9
00:00:32.72 --> 00:00:38.28
It's just almost impossible not to find lessons and save yourself.

10
00:00:38.28 --> 00:00:42.84
I don't need to worry about that section right there.

11
00:00:42.84 --> 00:00:52.28
So to take these experiences from this leader and commander and trying to climb.

12
00:00:52.28 --> 00:00:59.96
That this this book was the guide book for my biggest mentor, Colonel David Hackworth,

13
00:00:59.96 --> 00:01:03.68
author about face and there's so many threads.

14
00:01:03.68 --> 00:01:10.08
I just noticed that thread today or the on the last podcast, the thread between General Clark

15
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:14.56
and making the men stand to and then then being okay with it once they almost got overrun

16
00:01:14.56 --> 00:01:15.56
and hackworth.

17
00:01:15.56 --> 00:01:19.32
I just, there the threads just connected on that last podcast.

18
00:01:19.32 --> 00:01:22.08
So the threads keep getting connected.

19
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:29.56
If you want to see the threads of the way hackworth learned to lead, which in turn taught

20
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:32.32
me how to lead, they all tie right back to General Clark.

21
00:01:32.32 --> 00:01:33.32
So that's what we're doing.

22
00:01:33.32 --> 00:01:41.04
We're tracking these lessons to their root cause, to their root to the source and learning

23
00:01:41.04 --> 00:01:42.04
as we do it.

24
00:01:42.04 --> 00:01:47.48
Part three of Guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark.

25
00:01:47.48 --> 00:01:49.68
First section we get into today.

26
00:01:49.68 --> 00:01:54.72
We're on chapter five, the conduct of inspections.

27
00:01:54.72 --> 00:01:59.000
And I'll tell you this as I was as I was parsing this book, the first time I prep for it,

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.20
I thought, life and I were going to get through half of it and I thought, life and I

29
00:02:03.20 --> 00:02:04.64
will do back to back podcasts.

30
00:02:04.64 --> 00:02:07.16
We'll do half in one podcast.

31
00:02:07.16 --> 00:02:11.28
So we'd cover 60 or so pages and then we do half, we just do come do them back to back.

32
00:02:11.28 --> 00:02:14.48
We made it through 13 pages.

33
00:02:14.48 --> 00:02:17.96
So now as I'm reading and I'm looking for like the breaking points or where I can go,

34
00:02:17.96 --> 00:02:19.84
okay, this is a good section.

35
00:02:19.84 --> 00:02:26.96
This section today, the end of this section we're to cover today is it's it's it's freaking

36
00:02:26.96 --> 00:02:27.96
epic.

37
00:02:27.96 --> 00:02:32.40
I don't know, though that we're around very often.

38
00:02:32.40 --> 00:02:33.60
So we'll get there.

39
00:02:33.60 --> 00:02:38.36
But this chapter five starts off with the conduct of inspections.

40
00:02:38.36 --> 00:02:41.60
And the first question is why inspect and then it says there is a saying.

41
00:02:41.60 --> 00:02:47.40
An organization does well only those things, the boss checks.

42
00:02:47.40 --> 00:02:52.12
This true is originated in so far as I am concerned from a speech that I heard made by

43
00:02:52.12 --> 00:02:55.20
a vice president of one of our largest corporations.

44
00:02:55.20 --> 00:03:01.40
This is not a new thought to anyone who has military experience because I've often heard

45
00:03:01.40 --> 00:03:06.80
it expressed as anything that has not been inspected has been neglected.

46
00:03:06.80 --> 00:03:10.60
I changed the way I said that word to neglected.

47
00:03:10.60 --> 00:03:12.64
But it made it sound a lot better.

48
00:03:12.64 --> 00:03:18.28
So anything that has not been inspected has been neglected.

49
00:03:18.28 --> 00:03:21.96
If these sayings are true and I think they are, it follows that anyone who has important

50
00:03:21.96 --> 00:03:27.56
position must be able to check in on or inspect the operations which he's responsible.

51
00:03:27.56 --> 00:03:33.16
Life when life saw this, I think I sent a picture of this to life because this is, you

52
00:03:33.16 --> 00:03:35.96
know, a line that I hear, life say a lot.

53
00:03:35.96 --> 00:03:40.60
It's a line that he heard me say a lot and we always attribute it to hack worth.

54
00:03:40.60 --> 00:03:43.20
We always attribute it to hack worth.

55
00:03:43.20 --> 00:03:46.68
And guess what, it didn't come from hack worth.

56
00:03:46.68 --> 00:03:51.32
So how to inspect or turn on how to inspect civilians often think of a non-commissioned

57
00:03:51.32 --> 00:04:00.16
officer and officer as a demon inspector, a demon inspector, a good inspector is certainly not

58
00:04:00.16 --> 00:04:05.36
a demon, but good inspectors are not plentiful in the army or out of it.

59
00:04:05.36 --> 00:04:09.88
However, to be a successful non-commissioned officer or a successful officer, one should

60
00:04:09.88 --> 00:04:11.60
be a competent inspector.

61
00:04:11.60 --> 00:04:15.16
This quality cannot be attained without a considerable amount of study, planning and

62
00:04:15.16 --> 00:04:16.16
practice.

63
00:04:16.16 --> 00:04:26.52
Now, this is interesting because I wasn't sure how much of this section to cover because

64
00:04:26.52 --> 00:04:33.92
inspections are not something that I utilized to any great extent as a leader.

65
00:04:33.92 --> 00:04:34.92
And I was a leader.

66
00:04:34.92 --> 00:04:40.36
I didn't inspections was not one of my big tools.

67
00:04:40.36 --> 00:04:43.92
And so I thought, well, you know, I'm well talk about it.

68
00:04:43.92 --> 00:04:46.80
You know, you certainly have to inspect things and I get that and that's why I would say

69
00:04:46.80 --> 00:04:47.80
that.

70
00:04:47.80 --> 00:04:49.52
Hey, an organization does well and things to the boss checks.

71
00:04:49.52 --> 00:04:52.72
I've said that many times and I believe it.

72
00:04:52.72 --> 00:04:59.72
But also, I believe that if I have to inspect you, that means I'm doing something wrong

73
00:04:59.72 --> 00:05:00.72
somewhere else.

74
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:04.80
And like if I've got it, if my gig is I've got to inspect you, that means I'm making

75
00:05:04.80 --> 00:05:09.56
some other kind of mistakes somewhere because should I have to inspect that your weapon is

76
00:05:09.56 --> 00:05:10.56
ready?

77
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:12.68
Should I have to inspect that you've prepared for an operation?

78
00:05:12.68 --> 00:05:15.12
Should I have to inspect that you've done the work that you're supposed to?

79
00:05:15.12 --> 00:05:21.08
I shouldn't have to inspect if I've led correctly, then you know why you're doing what

80
00:05:21.08 --> 00:05:22.96
you're doing.

81
00:05:22.96 --> 00:05:27.44
And therefore, you don't really need to get inspected because you understand the why and

82
00:05:27.44 --> 00:05:28.44
you make things happen.

83
00:05:28.44 --> 00:05:31.04
So I've always had that attitude and it's been very successful for me.

84
00:05:31.04 --> 00:05:35.28
So I wasn't sure how much I was going to get into this whole inspection mode because

85
00:05:35.28 --> 00:05:37.88
what I don't want to do is create a bunch of leaders that are going out there becoming

86
00:05:37.88 --> 00:05:41.88
these inspection happy, you know, dig down hell, coming in and inspect you.

87
00:05:41.88 --> 00:05:45.88
You know what's funny with my kids?

88
00:05:45.88 --> 00:05:51.32
If you know my kids, whenever my wife's not around, my kids are, they have to do everything,

89
00:05:51.32 --> 00:05:52.48
right?

90
00:05:52.48 --> 00:05:56.96
And so I'll say, are you, you know, what time will you be ready for inspection?

91
00:05:56.96 --> 00:05:59.72
Or are they just get so they know what that means?

92
00:05:59.72 --> 00:06:03.28
I'm going to inspect, I'm going to inspect and they're better be squared away.

93
00:06:03.28 --> 00:06:10.20
So I didn't want to create, I don't want to pass on this idea that, hey, you guys got

94
00:06:10.20 --> 00:06:14.36
to be inspection, inspection freak.

95
00:06:14.36 --> 00:06:18.20
You know, I never want people to think that the military is what the military is portrayed

96
00:06:18.20 --> 00:06:23.28
in boot camp, which is you're getting inspected all the time.

97
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:30.64
So that being said, as I read through this, I thought my better cover this because, well,

98
00:06:30.64 --> 00:06:31.64
you'll see.

99
00:06:31.64 --> 00:06:34.16
So here we go, back to the book.

100
00:06:34.16 --> 00:06:38.16
It is very seldom that I visit a unit in installation or headquarters that I do not see

101
00:06:38.16 --> 00:06:43.36
things which are apparently not correct and which need pointing out, which only need

102
00:06:43.36 --> 00:06:45.88
pointing out to get them promptly corrected.

103
00:06:45.88 --> 00:06:48.72
So it's very seldom that you go somewhere and you see something to go, hey, man, why

104
00:06:48.72 --> 00:06:49.72
isn't that right?

105
00:06:49.72 --> 00:06:53.16
And all you have to do is tell them that it's not right and they fix it.

106
00:06:53.16 --> 00:06:57.56
I notice a similar situation in reading the reports of the Inspector General inspections.

107
00:06:57.56 --> 00:07:02.76
I often wonder why the responsible person on the spot has not noticed them and corrected

108
00:07:02.76 --> 00:07:03.76
them.

109
00:07:03.76 --> 00:07:05.60
Like, you're there.

110
00:07:05.60 --> 00:07:09.40
Why don't you notice that this shortfall exists?

111
00:07:09.40 --> 00:07:10.40
Here's one reason.

112
00:07:10.40 --> 00:07:15.20
It may be because he has lived so close to them that his ability to notice them has become

113
00:07:15.20 --> 00:07:16.20
fatigued.

114
00:07:16.20 --> 00:07:17.36
So what does that mean?

115
00:07:17.36 --> 00:07:18.36
You're not detached.

116
00:07:18.36 --> 00:07:21.000
You're not detached, so you don't see these mistakes.

117
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.20
What I am inclined to think that it is because, so that's a possibility, but I am inclined

118
00:07:25.20 --> 00:07:30.96
to think that is because he has not conducted his inspections in a systematic and effective

119
00:07:30.96 --> 00:07:31.96
way.

120
00:07:31.96 --> 00:07:37.96
So even when you're not detached, even when you're totally engaged, if you inspect correctly,

121
00:07:37.96 --> 00:07:43.000
you should still be able to pick up on things that you would otherwise miss.

122
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.40
Too often officers and senior uncommissioned, noncommissioned officers have a general

123
00:07:48.40 --> 00:07:52.12
looksy rather than an inspection.

124
00:07:52.12 --> 00:07:56.08
They go through their areas of responsibility without noticing things to correct and what

125
00:07:56.08 --> 00:08:00.76
is more without noticing good things for which someone should be complimented.

126
00:08:00.76 --> 00:08:02.44
That's one of the reasons why I had to cover this.

127
00:08:02.44 --> 00:08:05.92
Because an inspection isn't about finding what I can nitpick about you.

128
00:08:05.92 --> 00:08:10.40
It's actually about what I can find to compliment you on.

129
00:08:10.40 --> 00:08:12.12
Totally different attitude.

130
00:08:12.12 --> 00:08:15.80
My purpose for inspecting you is so I can find things that you're doing awesome at

131
00:08:15.80 --> 00:08:20.12
and compliment you for.

132
00:08:20.12 --> 00:08:25.32
To become a good inspector requires, as I have said before, study planning and practice.

133
00:08:25.32 --> 00:08:29.48
It requires study to be sure that he knows what is correct and what is not correct in

134
00:08:29.48 --> 00:08:31.56
the field of his responsibility.

135
00:08:31.56 --> 00:08:36.76
It requires planning to prepare a schedule of inspections in such a way that over a period

136
00:08:36.76 --> 00:08:41.12
of time he has given the necessary attention to all aspects of his field of responsibility.

137
00:08:41.12 --> 00:08:45.000
And then it requires practice in order to notice promptly whether the important things

138
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.68
are correct or incorrect.

139
00:08:46.68 --> 00:08:49.80
Notice he said important things.

140
00:08:49.80 --> 00:08:54.000
Important things and you can absolutely get bogged down in things that are not important.

141
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.16
In fact, the military, if you're not careful, you will start to focus on things that are

142
00:09:00.16 --> 00:09:01.16
not important.

143
00:09:01.16 --> 00:09:07.16
On the last podcast you were talking about the fact that when you were a squadron commander,

144
00:09:07.16 --> 00:09:11.36
your attitude was, we are inspection ready at all times.

145
00:09:11.36 --> 00:09:17.48
Does that mean that we scrub the grout on the backside of the whatever bathroom in the

146
00:09:17.48 --> 00:09:19.48
third floor?

147
00:09:19.48 --> 00:09:21.64
No, because does that really matter?

148
00:09:21.64 --> 00:09:22.64
Is that an important thing?

149
00:09:22.64 --> 00:09:23.64
No, is it clean?

150
00:09:23.64 --> 00:09:24.64
Yes, it's clean.

151
00:09:24.64 --> 00:09:25.92
Absolutely, it's clean.

152
00:09:25.92 --> 00:09:28.20
It's fully functional.

153
00:09:28.20 --> 00:09:29.88
It's totally ready.

154
00:09:29.88 --> 00:09:32.92
But we're not wasting time on it because it's not really that important.

155
00:09:32.92 --> 00:09:33.92
What is important?

156
00:09:33.92 --> 00:09:36.000
The mechanics of the freaking aircraft.

157
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.28
The cleanliness of the area where we're actually doing work that keeps these machines

158
00:09:41.28 --> 00:09:43.96
up and running.

159
00:09:43.96 --> 00:09:48.08
If I had my guy scrubbed the grout of the bathrooms prior to someone coming to visit,

160
00:09:48.08 --> 00:09:51.08
I'm telling them that's what I care about.

161
00:09:51.08 --> 00:09:55.72
And that's not what I want them to care about.

162
00:09:55.72 --> 00:10:01.84
In the study phase, most people find that a checklist is necessary.

163
00:10:01.84 --> 00:10:02.84
Think about that.

164
00:10:02.84 --> 00:10:04.08
A checklist is necessary.

165
00:10:04.08 --> 00:10:05.84
This ensures that you can tell.

166
00:10:05.84 --> 00:10:08.04
I've been picking this up as a reading this.

167
00:10:08.04 --> 00:10:11.48
General Clark is kind of an anal root that I've do for sure.

168
00:10:11.48 --> 00:10:12.68
He's about checklists.

169
00:10:12.68 --> 00:10:13.68
He's about inspections.

170
00:10:13.68 --> 00:10:16.20
He's got that nature to him.

171
00:10:16.20 --> 00:10:18.04
So we need to keep that in mind.

172
00:10:18.04 --> 00:10:22.44
We need to keep in mind that why is he, why is this guy with all this experience?

173
00:10:22.44 --> 00:10:24.60
Why is he using a checklist?

174
00:10:24.60 --> 00:10:25.60
Why is that?

175
00:10:25.60 --> 00:10:27.68
Oh, because it works.

176
00:10:27.68 --> 00:10:31.28
I used to take every single piece of gear that I would take on trips and I would have

177
00:10:31.28 --> 00:10:36.56
a little checkbox next to it to make sure I had what I need to have.

178
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:37.56
Check this.

179
00:10:37.56 --> 00:10:41.40
Because this ensures that important things are not overlooked and assist the inspector

180
00:10:41.40 --> 00:10:45.36
until he has become so proficient through practice that he carries a mental checklist in his

181
00:10:45.36 --> 00:10:46.36
head.

182
00:10:46.36 --> 00:10:52.36
There are inherent evils in the use of a checklist unless this is made out well.

183
00:10:52.36 --> 00:10:57.24
It does focus great attention to the items listed which may cause other important things,

184
00:10:57.24 --> 00:11:02.60
which may have been left off the checklist to be overlooked.

185
00:11:02.60 --> 00:11:07.92
It must be remembered that two inspect is to emphasize which is what you just said.

186
00:11:07.92 --> 00:11:14.56
To inspect is to emphasize if you are cleaning the grout on the third floor bathroom,

187
00:11:14.56 --> 00:11:19.12
that's what you're emphasizing as important.

188
00:11:19.12 --> 00:11:28.72
And honestly, do I want one minute of time when I'm running an F-35 squadron that has

189
00:11:28.72 --> 00:11:34.68
multi-million dollar aircraft that are life-saving machines?

190
00:11:34.68 --> 00:11:39.64
I want anyone scrubbing on the third floor in the third floor bathroom that never gets used

191
00:11:39.64 --> 00:11:41.48
and never gets seen.

192
00:11:41.48 --> 00:11:45.24
No.

193
00:11:45.24 --> 00:11:49.80
In the planning phase, one should make a list of all items or phases of his responsibility

194
00:11:49.80 --> 00:11:51.92
on which he wants to check in most jobs.

195
00:11:51.92 --> 00:11:54.52
This list will probably have 30 or 40 items on it.

196
00:11:54.52 --> 00:11:58.92
It is manifestly impossible in one trip through a platoon, company battalion battle group

197
00:11:58.92 --> 00:12:02.000
or similar area to check adequately all 40 items.

198
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.56
Therefore he should keep this list and select from it three or four items each week or

199
00:12:06.56 --> 00:12:07.96
other interval.

200
00:12:07.96 --> 00:12:11.20
When he inspects he should do a very thorough job on these selected items.

201
00:12:11.20 --> 00:12:15.28
Of course, to do a thorough job, he must have studied up on each item selected beforehand,

202
00:12:15.28 --> 00:12:19.56
so that he knows what is right and what is wrong and what to look for.

203
00:12:19.56 --> 00:12:23.76
By selecting a new group of three or four items each week, he will over a period of

204
00:12:23.76 --> 00:12:27.88
time have covered all of them and by the time he comes to the end of the list, he will

205
00:12:27.88 --> 00:12:32.28
have really checked all the aspects of his responsibility and will become a master of his

206
00:12:32.28 --> 00:12:39.52
job, what is more at that time if he has been effective as an inspector, his responsibility

207
00:12:39.52 --> 00:12:41.52
will be carried out in a superior manner.

208
00:12:41.52 --> 00:12:42.52
Great.

209
00:12:42.52 --> 00:12:43.92
You know what else is awesome about that?

210
00:12:43.92 --> 00:12:44.92
What's cooler?

211
00:12:44.92 --> 00:12:45.92
What's better?

212
00:12:45.92 --> 00:12:52.20
What to your last podcast about being about humanizing yourself to your troops?

213
00:12:52.20 --> 00:12:54.40
What does a better job of humanizing?

214
00:12:54.40 --> 00:12:59.56
Telling you, hey, once every three months I'm going to come and inspect 40 items and it's

215
00:12:59.56 --> 00:13:02.000
going to take eight hours and you're going to be standing at a period rest of the whole

216
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.48
time or I'm going to come down once a week.

217
00:13:03.48 --> 00:13:09.88
I'm going to check two or three things, get to know you, talk to you, game, it's obvious.

218
00:13:09.88 --> 00:13:10.88
Yeah.

219
00:13:10.88 --> 00:13:13.20
And maybe even tell you, hey, you're doing an awesome job down here.

220
00:13:13.20 --> 00:13:16.52
This is good to go.

221
00:13:16.52 --> 00:13:17.92
Man, the difference.

222
00:13:17.92 --> 00:13:18.92
Okay.

223
00:13:18.92 --> 00:13:20.52
Let me ask you this.

224
00:13:20.52 --> 00:13:22.40
Let's say I'm a nitpicker.

225
00:13:22.40 --> 00:13:25.000
Let's say I roll down to your flight light.

226
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.36
And I see that there's whatever some dust on one of these pieces of tools and I walk

227
00:13:30.36 --> 00:13:37.48
over with my white glove and I inspect it and I hold it up to you and I go, this is junk.

228
00:13:37.48 --> 00:13:38.48
You're a slob.

229
00:13:38.48 --> 00:13:39.80
Everything else is quite a bit.

230
00:13:39.80 --> 00:13:40.80
I year a slob.

231
00:13:40.80 --> 00:13:41.80
Okay.

232
00:13:41.80 --> 00:13:43.80
First of all, what do I care about?

233
00:13:43.80 --> 00:13:46.28
I've showed you that I care about dust and tools.

234
00:13:46.28 --> 00:13:51.28
And overall, are you inspired to do a good job for me?

235
00:13:51.28 --> 00:13:53.64
No.

236
00:13:53.64 --> 00:14:01.08
What if I come down and I look at your toolbox and I go, man, I can see that the way

237
00:14:01.08 --> 00:14:05.24
you got your tools labeled that you are a professional.

238
00:14:05.24 --> 00:14:06.64
That is legit.

239
00:14:06.64 --> 00:14:08.08
You know what?

240
00:14:08.08 --> 00:14:12.72
Every time I start up one of these aircraft, I'm going to feel good in my heart

241
00:14:12.72 --> 00:14:16.24
that you're down here, maintaining these aircraft.

242
00:14:16.24 --> 00:14:17.56
Thank you.

243
00:14:17.56 --> 00:14:18.56
What is that guy doing?

244
00:14:18.56 --> 00:14:20.56
That guy's polishing these tools, man.

245
00:14:20.56 --> 00:14:22.12
He's polishing these tools.

246
00:14:22.12 --> 00:14:23.20
So do you want to rule out a fear?

247
00:14:23.20 --> 00:14:25.16
Do you want to rule out of admiration?

248
00:14:25.16 --> 00:14:30.92
Is that hard?

249
00:14:30.92 --> 00:14:36.72
If you take one step back and think of the outcome you're trying to create, the real outcome

250
00:14:36.72 --> 00:14:37.72
that you're trying to create.

251
00:14:37.72 --> 00:14:39.64
And as a squadron commander, you just described it.

252
00:14:39.64 --> 00:14:47.84
I want 150 maintainers who are who their entire commitment to life is to make sure these

253
00:14:47.84 --> 00:14:49.60
airplanes are safe to operate.

254
00:14:49.60 --> 00:14:50.60
That's what I want.

255
00:14:50.60 --> 00:14:56.76
A commitment to making sure that we have these machines that are safe.

256
00:14:56.76 --> 00:15:00.84
If I just think about that, it's actually not hard to go, well, which of these two ways

257
00:15:00.84 --> 00:15:02.08
is going to get my guy?

258
00:15:02.08 --> 00:15:04.76
I'm a marine to think the way that I want him to think.

259
00:15:04.76 --> 00:15:05.76
It's really not that hard.

260
00:15:05.76 --> 00:15:09.12
You just have to reverse positions to go, how would I feel about the guy coming down

261
00:15:09.12 --> 00:15:10.12
doing this to make?

262
00:15:10.12 --> 00:15:11.28
Oh, well, this makes sense.

263
00:15:11.28 --> 00:15:12.48
That doesn't make sense.

264
00:15:12.48 --> 00:15:13.72
Just do the one that makes sense.

265
00:15:13.72 --> 00:15:15.80
And you actually will get the outcome that you want.

266
00:15:15.80 --> 00:15:20.76
When you're saying that, I was thinking, if you can get a little connection of, hey, hey,

267
00:15:20.76 --> 00:15:22.92
I noticed these tools over here are kind of dusty.

268
00:15:22.92 --> 00:15:23.92
Are these kind of a weight?

269
00:15:23.92 --> 00:15:24.92
Do you not use these?

270
00:15:24.92 --> 00:15:25.92
Are these not necessary?

271
00:15:25.92 --> 00:15:27.16
Is this a bunch of stuff that you've got to manage?

272
00:15:27.16 --> 00:15:30.44
It's not important because these things, obviously, are getting used like crazy.

273
00:15:30.44 --> 00:15:33.000
Hey, is there a way to kind of relieve you of something?

274
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.16
Just some connection have to go.

275
00:15:34.16 --> 00:15:36.28
Actually, sir, those things are terrible.

276
00:15:36.28 --> 00:15:37.72
We don't use them because they don't work.

277
00:15:37.72 --> 00:15:39.44
They just hit over there and collect dust.

278
00:15:39.44 --> 00:15:40.44
It's just an example.

279
00:15:40.44 --> 00:15:44.24
But if you can make the connection between what they're doing to get the outcome that you

280
00:15:44.24 --> 00:15:48.48
want, it's actually not that hard to do.

281
00:15:48.48 --> 00:15:49.48
Man.

282
00:15:49.48 --> 00:15:50.48
Man.

283
00:15:50.48 --> 00:15:51.68
All right.

284
00:15:51.68 --> 00:15:56.04
Back to the book.

285
00:15:56.04 --> 00:15:59.68
Whether he announces beforehand the items that he is going to check each, you know, that

286
00:15:59.68 --> 00:16:03.36
hole for that hole conversation we just had, that's like something that we need to continue

287
00:16:03.36 --> 00:16:06.68
to talk about.

288
00:16:06.68 --> 00:16:14.68
I see this all the time is like, it's really obvious with ego, right?

289
00:16:14.68 --> 00:16:17.80
When you're in it, you don't notice how stupid you look.

290
00:16:17.80 --> 00:16:21.04
And when you step outside and you see someone else behaving that way, you go, oh, this

291
00:16:21.04 --> 00:16:22.04
person's in any it.

292
00:16:22.04 --> 00:16:23.04
There he goes involved.

293
00:16:23.04 --> 00:16:26.12
But when it's you, but no, it's, it's me.

294
00:16:26.12 --> 00:16:27.12
It's different.

295
00:16:27.12 --> 00:16:28.12
It's different.

296
00:16:28.12 --> 00:16:29.12
It's different.

297
00:16:29.12 --> 00:16:32.68
No one will notice.

298
00:16:32.68 --> 00:16:34.52
I want that attention.

299
00:16:34.52 --> 00:16:36.56
I want that he, you didn't recognize me.

300
00:16:36.56 --> 00:16:39.08
I want, you know what, I want my black belt.

301
00:16:39.08 --> 00:16:40.08
How's that work?

302
00:16:40.08 --> 00:16:43.16
Yeah, not good.

303
00:16:43.16 --> 00:16:44.16
Back to the book.

304
00:16:44.16 --> 00:16:45.16
Sorry.

305
00:16:45.16 --> 00:16:48.60
Whether he announces beforehand the items that he is going to check each time as a matter

306
00:16:48.60 --> 00:16:49.60
of individual choice.

307
00:16:49.60 --> 00:16:53.72
Some officers, publishers, publishers, publishers to assist in training their subordinates.

308
00:16:53.72 --> 00:16:55.36
Good results have been obtained that way.

309
00:16:55.36 --> 00:16:59.16
One basic rule, however, is that having once announced an inspection, he owes it to the

310
00:16:59.16 --> 00:17:03.20
people underneath him to make it fair and thorough.

311
00:17:03.20 --> 00:17:08.64
He also owes it to the people, inspect the privilege of being commended for the good things

312
00:17:08.64 --> 00:17:13.32
found as well as criticism for the things which are not up to standard.

313
00:17:13.32 --> 00:17:19.60
That whole idea, if you just flip the, I'm inspecting you so I can see what you're doing

314
00:17:19.60 --> 00:17:21.64
awesome, inspect all the time.

315
00:17:21.64 --> 00:17:25.28
Totally.

316
00:17:25.28 --> 00:17:30.16
I have never known a good inspector who did not acquire a highly developed curiosity

317
00:17:30.16 --> 00:17:31.96
and the ability to notice details.

318
00:17:31.96 --> 00:17:34.000
This can come to anyone with practice.

319
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.08
On one occasion, I visited country where units of the Army are stationed.

320
00:17:38.08 --> 00:17:42.92
I was met at the airfield by a field grade officer of the local headquarters.

321
00:17:42.92 --> 00:17:48.04
During the ride, during the ride from the airfield unit, I noticed that the civilian

322
00:17:48.04 --> 00:17:53.04
passenger cars we met had the drivers on the left side, but the large trucks had the

323
00:17:53.04 --> 00:17:54.52
drivers on the right side.

324
00:17:54.52 --> 00:17:58.96
This seemed odd to me, so I inquired of my escort why this should be so.

325
00:17:58.96 --> 00:18:02.60
He remarked that although having been in the country for over a year, he had not noticed

326
00:18:02.60 --> 00:18:03.60
that.

327
00:18:03.60 --> 00:18:07.12
I would surprise that he would not develop into your good inspector.

328
00:18:07.12 --> 00:18:14.08
If you, as either commander or a staff member follow these hints and rules, you will not

329
00:18:14.08 --> 00:18:20.88
be known as a demon inspector, but as a competent and effective manager.

330
00:18:20.88 --> 00:18:25.24
And then he says it one more time in big bold print and organization does well only those

331
00:18:25.24 --> 00:18:28.92
things the boss checks.

332
00:18:28.92 --> 00:18:37.32
If you're in a leadership role and you're inspecting your people, or if you want to take

333
00:18:37.32 --> 00:18:42.48
it to set further, if someone else is coming in, like the IG is this in the military,

334
00:18:42.48 --> 00:18:46.92
the IG is this other group, this inspector general group is another team that actually

335
00:18:46.92 --> 00:18:48.88
comes into inspect you.

336
00:18:48.88 --> 00:18:53.76
So whether it's you or somebody else, if I'm a leader and I'm inspecting my people,

337
00:18:53.76 --> 00:18:55.92
I'm actually just inspecting myself.

338
00:18:55.92 --> 00:18:58.80
And it's everything I see is a pure reflection of me.

339
00:18:58.80 --> 00:19:05.20
So the idea that I be down there, design to criticize them for not doing the things I need

340
00:19:05.20 --> 00:19:06.20
them to do.

341
00:19:06.20 --> 00:19:10.64
If you just have the mindset in your brain, my inspection of my people is actually an evaluation

342
00:19:10.64 --> 00:19:12.08
of my own performance.

343
00:19:12.08 --> 00:19:15.84
It can completely change the way you see what it is that you're looking at.

344
00:19:15.84 --> 00:19:17.84
The inspection is you.

345
00:19:17.84 --> 00:19:22.60
And that was part of the reason as a commander and a squadron when I said, listen, Marines,

346
00:19:22.60 --> 00:19:27.72
if we have we have visitors, you will not allocate additional time to cleaning.

347
00:19:27.72 --> 00:19:30.04
I said that that was like a standing rule in my squadron.

348
00:19:30.04 --> 00:19:34.24
If people are coming in to inspect it and inspect our facility, you will not allocate additional

349
00:19:34.24 --> 00:19:35.24
time to clean.

350
00:19:35.24 --> 00:19:37.96
I want it to be as clean as it needs to be.

351
00:19:37.96 --> 00:19:39.40
Do what you would normally do.

352
00:19:39.40 --> 00:19:44.36
And if they come in and this place is a dump, then I clearly have not allocated the time,

353
00:19:44.36 --> 00:19:46.76
not done the things I need to do.

354
00:19:46.76 --> 00:19:49.52
But if they come in and go, hey, this place is good to go.

355
00:19:49.52 --> 00:19:52.72
That's a reflection of me as a leader, not of my man or my Marines.

356
00:19:52.72 --> 00:19:54.80
It's me who's being inspected.

357
00:19:54.80 --> 00:19:58.44
And just that view of what is your actually evaluating?

358
00:19:58.44 --> 00:20:01.20
Yeah, well, check this out.

359
00:20:01.20 --> 00:20:09.92
If I come down to inspect Dave and instead of me blaming you for whatever shortfalls you

360
00:20:09.92 --> 00:20:17.48
have, I say, hey, Dave, I noticed that your tools are not in the proper place.

361
00:20:17.48 --> 00:20:20.84
And when they're not in the proper place, they could get caught of the flight line, they

362
00:20:20.84 --> 00:20:23.60
could ruin an engine, someone could hurt or killed.

363
00:20:23.60 --> 00:20:28.04
I don't think I've done a good job of explaining to you why this is important.

364
00:20:28.04 --> 00:20:29.40
That's a soundporter.

365
00:20:29.40 --> 00:20:31.40
So I've failed as a leader.

366
00:20:31.40 --> 00:20:34.72
The fact that you're not 100% square away is my fault.

367
00:20:34.72 --> 00:20:35.72
That's why.

368
00:20:35.72 --> 00:20:40.56
That's why I'm scared of this whole idea a little bit.

369
00:20:40.56 --> 00:20:41.88
That's why it scares me.

370
00:20:41.88 --> 00:20:47.000
Even when I say this, an organization does well only those things the boss checks.

371
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:56.64
I can tell you that my seal platoon, my seal task unit, my echelon front, does all kinds

372
00:20:56.64 --> 00:21:01.08
of things exceptionally well that I don't check.

373
00:21:01.08 --> 00:21:04.16
I know that.

374
00:21:04.16 --> 00:21:14.04
So that's why I'm a little nervous about trying to make people into hyper inspectors.

375
00:21:14.04 --> 00:21:18.16
I look at inspection kind of the same way as I look at accountability because they are

376
00:21:18.16 --> 00:21:19.16
very similar.

377
00:21:19.16 --> 00:21:22.36
And I've always said, okay, to me, accountability is a crutch.

378
00:21:22.36 --> 00:21:23.36
Look, it's a tool.

379
00:21:23.36 --> 00:21:25.32
I'm not saying crutches are bad.

380
00:21:25.32 --> 00:21:29.40
When you have a broken leg, you got to get a crutch so you can get around.

381
00:21:29.40 --> 00:21:35.12
Inspections to me are very similar to, in fact, they are a form of accountability.

382
00:21:35.12 --> 00:21:42.68
But if that's my primary tool for leadership is just to hold everyone accountable and go

383
00:21:42.68 --> 00:21:46.80
inspect them all the time, that's not a good functioning tool.

384
00:21:46.80 --> 00:21:48.60
It's not the right way to use that tool.

385
00:21:48.60 --> 00:21:54.60
If I've got 300 weapons inside task unit bruiser and the only way I can make sure that

386
00:21:54.60 --> 00:21:59.20
their clean is by inspecting them twice a week, that's an embarrassment to me actually.

387
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:00.44
That's an embarrassment to me.

388
00:22:00.44 --> 00:22:03.08
It's a bearer's commitment to the platoon commanders, it's embarrassment to the platoon

389
00:22:03.08 --> 00:22:08.48
chiefs and it's a bearer's to everyone in the platoon task unit because we all know why it's

390
00:22:08.48 --> 00:22:10.92
important to keep our weapon squared away.

391
00:22:10.92 --> 00:22:15.72
And if we're not in the only way I can get them to do that as to inspect them, it's wrong.

392
00:22:15.72 --> 00:22:19.56
They should know the culture that we have, they should understand why it's important

393
00:22:19.56 --> 00:22:22.60
and therefore I shouldn't have to inspect the damn thing.

394
00:22:22.60 --> 00:22:31.76
Now all that being said, you certainly do, I certainly did inspect the weapons and task

395
00:22:31.76 --> 00:22:32.76
in a bruiser.

396
00:22:32.76 --> 00:22:33.76
I didn't do it a lot.

397
00:22:33.76 --> 00:22:36.76
I did it a couple of times in the beginning just to make sure, hey, everyone gets it,

398
00:22:36.76 --> 00:22:38.000
everyone knows.

399
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.36
But after three inspections in the first three months, you think I went down there to make

400
00:22:43.36 --> 00:22:46.92
sure, I'm just going to make sure, by the way, what kind of trust is that?

401
00:22:46.92 --> 00:22:51.64
What kind of, am I telling my platoon that I trust them when I, one of the platoons that

402
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:54.16
I, am I telling, latef1 that I trust them and I say, hey, latef1, I want to go inspect

403
00:22:54.16 --> 00:22:55.16
the weapons today.

404
00:22:55.16 --> 00:22:57.48
He should be able to look at me, don't waste your time boss.

405
00:22:57.48 --> 00:22:58.88
We're good.

406
00:22:58.88 --> 00:22:59.88
And you know what I'd say?

407
00:22:59.88 --> 00:23:02.72
Cool.

408
00:23:02.72 --> 00:23:03.72
Is there a chance?

409
00:23:03.72 --> 00:23:09.20
Latef, latef will talk about this.

410
00:23:09.20 --> 00:23:12.92
He gave a little too much slack one time and didn't have, you know, one was guys and

411
00:23:12.92 --> 00:23:15.000
do a serialized inventory piece of gear went missing.

412
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.24
And it's like, he was like, yep, that's all me.

413
00:23:19.24 --> 00:23:20.12
Latef said that's all me.

414
00:23:20.12 --> 00:23:23.96
I obviously, little two hands off, little two decentralized.

415
00:23:23.96 --> 00:23:25.36
So what does that mean?

416
00:23:25.36 --> 00:23:30.32
I think that's why latef loves that term, loves that phrase so much because he knows

417
00:23:30.32 --> 00:23:33.24
he had that bite him in the ass.

418
00:23:33.24 --> 00:23:35.48
He had to start to up the level of inspections.

419
00:23:35.48 --> 00:23:40.04
So it is a tool.

420
00:23:40.04 --> 00:23:41.96
It is a tool.

421
00:23:41.96 --> 00:23:43.04
Don't overuse it.

422
00:23:43.04 --> 00:23:43.56
Use it.

423
00:23:43.56 --> 00:23:45.04
Yes.

424
00:23:45.04 --> 00:23:47.72
Don't overuse it.

425
00:23:47.72 --> 00:23:50.16
Don't overuse it.

426
00:23:50.16 --> 00:23:53.16
It's a lack of trust.

427
00:23:53.16 --> 00:23:55.80
Be careful.

428
00:23:55.80 --> 00:23:58.16
Yeah, I'm actually over here kind of rack in my brain.

429
00:23:58.16 --> 00:24:01.88
I'm thinking about my time in command.

430
00:24:01.88 --> 00:24:06.32
And I was trying to come up with a memory of inspecting something.

431
00:24:06.32 --> 00:24:11.12
And I couldn't think of like a formal inspection that I did.

432
00:24:11.12 --> 00:24:18.000
And at the same time, I had a very strong sense in real time of whether my guys are working

433
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.40
on the things I wanted them to work on.

434
00:24:19.40 --> 00:24:20.80
Now, I did have a luxury.

435
00:24:20.80 --> 00:24:25.32
And the answer I came to my head is when I went flying, you're talking about this idea

436
00:24:25.32 --> 00:24:28.000
of inspection.

437
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.64
When you go before you get into an airplane, you do what's called a pre flight.

438
00:24:31.64 --> 00:24:32.64
Which is an inspection.

439
00:24:32.64 --> 00:24:34.20
Because I started the nose of the airplane.

440
00:24:34.20 --> 00:24:35.20
I go all the way around.

441
00:24:35.20 --> 00:24:37.56
I check a bunch of things before I get into the airplane.

442
00:24:37.56 --> 00:24:41.40
Now, if I overshot the mark, I could walk up to the plane captain.

443
00:24:41.40 --> 00:24:43.36
We called it the Marine and charge of that plane.

444
00:24:43.36 --> 00:24:44.96
And I could say, is everything good to go?

445
00:24:44.96 --> 00:24:45.96
And you could say, yes.

446
00:24:45.96 --> 00:24:48.20
And the truth is, is that I actually trusted him.

447
00:24:48.20 --> 00:24:52.12
I could climb up that letter and go fly and come back.

448
00:24:52.12 --> 00:24:57.36
But if every single time I came out to the jet, I just climbed up and flew that airplane,

449
00:24:57.36 --> 00:25:00.56
he over time, he'd realize, hey, this guy's not really paying attention.

450
00:25:00.56 --> 00:25:04.60
And it's not that he, that this guy, Colonel Burke, doesn't care.

451
00:25:04.60 --> 00:25:06.60
Or doesn't trust me.

452
00:25:06.60 --> 00:25:07.60
He doesn't care as much.

453
00:25:07.60 --> 00:25:08.60
It's not that important.

454
00:25:08.60 --> 00:25:11.12
And I don't want him to think that.

455
00:25:11.12 --> 00:25:15.92
And at the same time, am I going to spend an hour walking around this airplane going,

456
00:25:15.92 --> 00:25:17.000
hey, devil dog, come down here.

457
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.12
I see this thing looking for things that are important, general integrity, and one

458
00:25:22.12 --> 00:25:24.64
set of blue moon are going, hey, can you come down here for a sec?

459
00:25:24.64 --> 00:25:28.20
Hey, this thing down here on this panel isn't this, I think it's supposed to be down

460
00:25:28.20 --> 00:25:29.20
in this switch.

461
00:25:29.20 --> 00:25:32.96
I think I can get this reader and if I would just show him, hey, these things are important

462
00:25:32.96 --> 00:25:34.76
to me, what you're doing is important.

463
00:25:34.76 --> 00:25:37.60
And I'm not looking to find ways to criticize you.

464
00:25:37.60 --> 00:25:42.76
So I actually did inspections all the time, but I really couldn't think of a time that

465
00:25:42.76 --> 00:25:46.96
in my years in command where I did an inspection, this is an inspection, be prepared for that

466
00:25:46.96 --> 00:25:47.96
inspection.

467
00:25:47.96 --> 00:25:52.88
And at the same time, everything I did as a leader was an inspection because everything

468
00:25:52.88 --> 00:25:57.72
I paid attention to was my signal to them of these things that matter.

469
00:25:57.72 --> 00:26:01.08
I had a safety incident when I was running training.

470
00:26:01.08 --> 00:26:03.16
There was a safety incident.

471
00:26:03.16 --> 00:26:13.88
And my boss, I could see you wanted to, what you wanted to bring a little bit of the

472
00:26:13.88 --> 00:26:15.92
thunder, right?

473
00:26:15.92 --> 00:26:24.16
And so unannounced inspection of my range, safety officer qualification letters.

474
00:26:24.16 --> 00:26:28.92
So I'm working at a training command where I've got whatever.

475
00:26:28.92 --> 00:26:36.40
I got 100 instructors, seal instructors, they're all range safety officers, all 100%.

476
00:26:36.40 --> 00:26:43.44
And so I've already, you know, paperwork is not my best quality.

477
00:26:43.44 --> 00:26:48.04
And the inspector shows up.

478
00:26:48.04 --> 00:26:55.52
And you know, it was like, I remember this, it was a fleet, like a fleet.

479
00:26:55.52 --> 00:26:59.80
I want to say it was a fleet, lieutenant, and chief.

480
00:26:59.80 --> 00:27:04.44
So they didn't send seals over because seals would have been like a hedgehog of what

481
00:27:04.44 --> 00:27:05.80
we're going to be over there in an hour.

482
00:27:05.80 --> 00:27:07.52
You might want to, you know, little heads up.

483
00:27:07.52 --> 00:27:09.56
They would have brod me out, right?

484
00:27:09.56 --> 00:27:10.76
No bro.

485
00:27:10.76 --> 00:27:13.84
These guys show up.

486
00:27:13.84 --> 00:27:19.92
And, you know, I get to add man, hey, hey, sir, we have an inspection.

487
00:27:19.92 --> 00:27:21.88
And I'm like an inspection.

488
00:27:21.88 --> 00:27:22.88
Okay.

489
00:27:22.88 --> 00:27:24.88
What do we get in perspective?

490
00:27:24.88 --> 00:27:27.84
So in comes this chief in the lieutenant.

491
00:27:27.84 --> 00:27:33.04
We need to check your RSO, your range safety officer qualifications for all your instructors.

492
00:27:33.04 --> 00:27:38.40
And I'm thinking, okay, in my mind, I'm like, whatever, I don't even know where these

493
00:27:38.40 --> 00:27:39.40
are.

494
00:27:39.40 --> 00:27:40.40
Right?

495
00:27:40.40 --> 00:27:43.80
I'm completely, I'm just, if I was, I want to just

496
00:27:43.80 --> 00:27:49.48
held out my, you know, get put my hands out to get cuffed, you know, like arrest me now.

497
00:27:49.48 --> 00:27:55.68
And sure enough, my admin department says, oh, you want to see the, you want to see the

498
00:27:55.68 --> 00:27:56.92
all the RSO qualifications.

499
00:27:56.92 --> 00:28:00.60
I make sure that every single person, every single hundred people here that all have

500
00:28:00.60 --> 00:28:04.04
that all by the way, rotate in at different times, they're all rotate now.

501
00:28:04.04 --> 00:28:08.36
There's not like any, it's not like a one unified group of people that's all getting

502
00:28:08.36 --> 00:28:09.36
qualified at the same time.

503
00:28:09.36 --> 00:28:11.88
No, these are random guys that are coming and going at different times.

504
00:28:11.88 --> 00:28:16.68
Oh, you want to see if all those hundred people are completely up to date and qualified

505
00:28:16.68 --> 00:28:19.80
for their range safety officer paperwork?

506
00:28:19.80 --> 00:28:21.60
Yeah, that's what we want to see.

507
00:28:21.60 --> 00:28:23.16
Okay, go, come over here.

508
00:28:23.16 --> 00:28:25.52
My admin team pulls them out and just starts.

509
00:28:25.52 --> 00:28:28.84
Yeah, oh, yeah, what, oh, you want to look at, you want to look at all hundred, everything

510
00:28:28.84 --> 00:28:31.84
was one, a hundred percent square to wait.

511
00:28:31.84 --> 00:28:32.84
100 percent square to wait.

512
00:28:32.84 --> 00:28:35.000
I had nothing to do with it.

513
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I had nothing to do with it.

514
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.44
Obviously, the guy that was, but had to me before me, had the implemented a system or

515
00:28:40.44 --> 00:28:44.92
someone at some point in implementing a system and there it was, a hundred percent square

516
00:28:44.92 --> 00:28:47.80
to wait.

517
00:28:47.80 --> 00:28:51.64
So that kind of thing, I can take no credit for that, but guess what?

518
00:28:51.64 --> 00:28:56.36
As I, that's a situation where guess what I should have done when I showed up at that

519
00:28:56.36 --> 00:28:57.36
command?

520
00:28:57.36 --> 00:29:01.44
I should have had a good list and you know what's in this book, there's a thing in this

521
00:29:01.44 --> 00:29:06.08
book that talks about how you turn over with someone think, what do you get ready?

522
00:29:06.08 --> 00:29:09.64
That's something when I showed up at the command, I should have said, okay, think about

523
00:29:09.64 --> 00:29:10.64
what this command does.

524
00:29:10.64 --> 00:29:13.56
Oh, we are range safety officers.

525
00:29:13.56 --> 00:29:15.000
That's one of our primary duties.

526
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.24
I should probably make sure that we are up to speed from an administrative perspective,

527
00:29:21.24 --> 00:29:24.52
which is again, what we already talked about on the last podcast, from an administrative

528
00:29:24.52 --> 00:29:25.52
perspective.

529
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:29.88
Because guess what, if my boss finds out that none of my guys are quality, the quality

530
00:29:29.88 --> 00:29:34.08
is all over the place, I should not, I'm not qualified to be in that job.

531
00:29:34.08 --> 00:29:35.32
That's bad.

532
00:29:35.32 --> 00:29:38.64
My guys, there's a reason for those range safety qualifications.

533
00:29:38.64 --> 00:29:40.56
I should have had that I should have inspected it.

534
00:29:40.56 --> 00:29:43.92
So there's an example of, look, I'm glad I got away with it.

535
00:29:43.92 --> 00:29:48.32
You know, I'm glad that somebody was more square, I'm glad that my own administrative department

536
00:29:48.32 --> 00:29:52.20
was more square than I was, but I don't like that feeling.

537
00:29:52.20 --> 00:29:56.72
So something like that, absolutely, I should have, I should have at some point said, hey,

538
00:29:56.72 --> 00:29:59.08
I'm going to take a look at our administrative records.

539
00:29:59.08 --> 00:30:03.40
That way, I feel comfortable and confident and also people realize that it is important.

540
00:30:03.40 --> 00:30:07.40
Because I didn't place it by, by never inspecting it, two things happened.

541
00:30:07.40 --> 00:30:09.08
One, no one thought it was important.

542
00:30:09.08 --> 00:30:14.52
And I'm just by the grace of God and good square to wait discipline that they did it.

543
00:30:14.52 --> 00:30:17.88
And number two, they never got me credit for doing that.

544
00:30:17.88 --> 00:30:21.80
I never got to go to my admin department and said, hey, I want to look at the records

545
00:30:21.80 --> 00:30:25.76
and then say, oh, here you go, boss, and me say great job.

546
00:30:25.76 --> 00:30:30.92
So even though I'm kind of downplaying the use of inspections, when you look at it as

547
00:30:30.92 --> 00:30:35.52
a positive tool, it's something that I should have used more.

548
00:30:35.52 --> 00:30:37.88
I had such a negative attitude towards inspections.

549
00:30:37.88 --> 00:30:42.40
I should have had a more positive attitude towards it and done them more often.

550
00:30:42.40 --> 00:30:50.52
So I think that is, that is when I'm walking away, my lesson learned is inspections.

551
00:30:50.52 --> 00:30:52.80
I think of them as a tool for accountability.

552
00:30:52.80 --> 00:30:58.64
I should think of them as inspections are a tool for complimentary activity with your

553
00:30:58.64 --> 00:31:02.60
troops, for confirming that the right things are being focused on.

554
00:31:02.60 --> 00:31:05.44
Because guess what, you know, of the admin department, you know how

555
00:31:05.44 --> 00:31:09.80
many RSOs, you know, me rain safety officers, they were in the admin department.

556
00:31:09.80 --> 00:31:12.24
Take a guess.

557
00:31:12.24 --> 00:31:14.04
Admin guys are RSOs?

558
00:31:14.04 --> 00:31:15.04
Yes, none.

559
00:31:15.04 --> 00:31:16.04
Zero.

560
00:31:16.04 --> 00:31:17.04
Exactly.

561
00:31:17.04 --> 00:31:18.04
They had no reason to be concerned about that.

562
00:31:18.04 --> 00:31:20.04
No, I've never made it important.

563
00:31:20.04 --> 00:31:21.04
I never made it important.

564
00:31:21.04 --> 00:31:23.04
Thankfully, they were great square to wait.

565
00:31:23.04 --> 00:31:24.04
Yeah.

566
00:31:24.04 --> 00:31:26.04
You know, sailors that got it done.

567
00:31:26.04 --> 00:31:27.04
Yeah.

568
00:31:27.04 --> 00:31:35.40
Chapter six, a successful manager.

569
00:31:35.40 --> 00:31:37.40
Advice from a civilian manager.

570
00:31:37.40 --> 00:31:40.96
When I was, and you know what, this is something that I, I've talked about before, which

571
00:31:40.96 --> 00:31:44.52
is in the 90s.

572
00:31:44.52 --> 00:31:45.80
And I don't know if you remember this.

573
00:31:45.80 --> 00:31:47.04
Maybe you saw it, maybe you didn't.

574
00:31:47.04 --> 00:31:53.64
In the 90s, there would be a lot of, hey, what can the military learn from, from civilian

575
00:31:53.64 --> 00:31:54.64
companies?

576
00:31:54.64 --> 00:31:59.48
There's a lot of like, hey, we want to send you out to IBM or whoever to see how they

577
00:31:59.48 --> 00:32:02.20
operate.

578
00:32:02.20 --> 00:32:08.96
And yet a lot of those lessons that the civilian businesses, the lot of the things that

579
00:32:08.96 --> 00:32:13.12
they did to operate was based on military opportunities, a bunch of guys that got out of World

580
00:32:13.12 --> 00:32:15.08
War 2 and said, hey, this is what we should do.

581
00:32:15.08 --> 00:32:16.08
Right?

582
00:32:16.08 --> 00:32:18.76
That the greatest generation came back and said, I know how to run shit.

583
00:32:18.76 --> 00:32:20.08
Watch this.

584
00:32:20.08 --> 00:32:21.08
Yeah.

585
00:32:21.08 --> 00:32:24.12
So it goes both ways.

586
00:32:24.12 --> 00:32:27.96
And, and it's something, but then sometimes it's like, oh, the military.

587
00:32:27.96 --> 00:32:31.24
So the civilians after World War II said, oh, we'll take all these practices from

588
00:32:31.24 --> 00:32:32.24
the military.

589
00:32:32.24 --> 00:32:34.12
And then here we were, this book came out 1963.

590
00:32:34.12 --> 00:32:38.28
Hey, let's make sure that we're learning from the corporate as well.

591
00:32:38.28 --> 00:32:43.32
So advice from a civilian manager, when I was taking my graduate work in civil engineering

592
00:32:43.32 --> 00:32:49.48
at Cornell University, the head of a very prominent and successful, general contracting

593
00:32:49.48 --> 00:32:54.68
firm spoke to us on what made a contractor successful or really what kept him from going

594
00:32:54.68 --> 00:32:55.68
broke.

595
00:32:55.68 --> 00:32:59.80
He said that if you went into a new area and wanted to talk about probably the most astute

596
00:32:59.80 --> 00:33:05.04
individual, there you should seek out a general contractor who has been in business successfully

597
00:33:05.04 --> 00:33:06.24
for at least 10 years.

598
00:33:06.24 --> 00:33:10.84
If you analyze his methods of operations, this is what you had find undoubtedly.

599
00:33:10.84 --> 00:33:11.84
Okay.

600
00:33:11.84 --> 00:33:16.80
So here's how this, here's how a civilian contractor runs a business.

601
00:33:16.80 --> 00:33:22.04
He collected and kept to up to date on detailed costs.

602
00:33:22.04 --> 00:33:28.56
He had his staff available to him as needed, expert advice in the field of engineering

603
00:33:28.56 --> 00:33:32.24
finance purchasing taxation, law, etc., and he used them.

604
00:33:32.24 --> 00:33:38.08
So on his staff, he had experts and we needed him and he talked to him.

605
00:33:38.08 --> 00:33:42.24
He had competent, formant, frontline leaders.

606
00:33:42.24 --> 00:33:45.40
He took the time to orient and train them.

607
00:33:45.40 --> 00:33:49.76
His relations with his workforce were good so that his turnover was small and provided

608
00:33:49.76 --> 00:33:51.48
key personnel with steady work.

609
00:33:51.48 --> 00:33:54.24
He had good labor relations.

610
00:33:54.24 --> 00:33:57.96
He obtained good equipment and kept it operating through positive program of inspection,

611
00:33:57.96 --> 00:34:00.40
maintenance and operator training.

612
00:34:00.40 --> 00:34:04.84
He understood the problems created by special conditions such as storms, weather, temperature,

613
00:34:04.84 --> 00:34:09.000
seasons, flood, climate and estimated and planned around them.

614
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.64
He had a good supervision and inspection setup to ensure quality, prevent delays and to

615
00:34:14.64 --> 00:34:20.32
overcome quickly unforeseen obstacles and ensure acceptance without costly adjustment or

616
00:34:20.32 --> 00:34:21.64
doing over.

617
00:34:21.64 --> 00:34:28.76
His plans always reflected much thought in economical methods of construction and then this

618
00:34:28.76 --> 00:34:37.36
last section says, but most of all, he was an expert on timing in that he programs, in

619
00:34:37.36 --> 00:34:42.68
that he programed the method, the flow of the following to the job at proper times and

620
00:34:42.68 --> 00:34:47.26
proper amounts with proper specifications and proper quality in order that none was

621
00:34:47.26 --> 00:34:53.50
overlooked, work was not delayed and none arrived too early and too much or too little.

622
00:34:53.50 --> 00:34:57.40
And then he goes through a big list, cost data, plans, decisions lay out of the area,

623
00:34:57.40 --> 00:34:59.90
flow charts, supervision setup, inspection.

624
00:34:59.90 --> 00:35:05.38
He goes on financing, workforce, field offices, field storage, power and light requirements.

625
00:35:05.38 --> 00:35:11.18
He goes through all this stuff and what he's basically saying is he make a list, make a list

626
00:35:11.18 --> 00:35:13.90
of what's important.

627
00:35:13.90 --> 00:35:18.78
And then he takes all that and says applicability to military situation.

628
00:35:18.78 --> 00:35:23.18
I'm sure you notice the great similarity between the management qualities required in a general

629
00:35:23.18 --> 00:35:30.06
contractor and those required in the commander of a military operation.

630
00:35:30.06 --> 00:35:32.62
Steps in command or in managing a job.

631
00:35:32.62 --> 00:35:37.62
One, based on the mission or orders, the commander determines, isolates and defines the

632
00:35:37.62 --> 00:35:41.22
limits of the problem.

633
00:35:41.22 --> 00:35:47.66
And every once in a while, I get something where I go, oh, and this is one of those moments.

634
00:35:47.66 --> 00:35:56.86
Number two, the commander turns the problem into an operation by issuing a clear and adequate

635
00:35:56.86 --> 00:36:04.42
directive for the conducting of it and what I really like about that is, and you know we

636
00:36:04.42 --> 00:36:08.66
hear it, define what the problem is, define what the problem is.

637
00:36:08.66 --> 00:36:12.70
If you don't know what the problem is, how are you doing anything else?

638
00:36:12.70 --> 00:36:16.50
And if you think about any mission that we ever did in the military, there's a problem

639
00:36:16.50 --> 00:36:18.98
that we're trying to solve.

640
00:36:18.98 --> 00:36:20.50
Any mission that we ever did, there's a problem.

641
00:36:20.50 --> 00:36:22.38
Hey, there's a bad guy.

642
00:36:22.38 --> 00:36:25.22
He's killing Americans.

643
00:36:25.22 --> 00:36:26.06
That's the problem.

644
00:36:26.06 --> 00:36:27.30
We want to get rid of them.

645
00:36:27.30 --> 00:36:30.02
Okay, how are we going to solve that problem?

646
00:36:30.02 --> 00:36:33.70
Here's your operation.

647
00:36:33.70 --> 00:36:45.06
If the help of the executive, the commander monitors and guides the staff, while it prepares,

648
00:36:45.06 --> 00:36:49.22
while it prepares, underlined by me.

649
00:36:49.22 --> 00:36:53.86
Not he prepares, it prepares for issue by him or the staff, coordinate instructions, plans

650
00:36:53.86 --> 00:36:55.86
and orders for implementing the directive.

651
00:36:55.86 --> 00:36:59.86
The commander follows up to see the plans, instructions, and orders are fully understood,

652
00:36:59.86 --> 00:37:04.66
and carried out, making the necessary modifications and additions as the operation progresses

653
00:37:04.66 --> 00:37:05.66
to accomplishment.

654
00:37:05.66 --> 00:37:08.66
There you go.

655
00:37:08.66 --> 00:37:14.42
So I'm over here, kind of, hearing all this for the first time, and I've actually been struggling

656
00:37:14.42 --> 00:37:16.42
with these last two sections in my brain.

657
00:37:16.42 --> 00:37:21.22
I'm struggling because I'm thinking about how I led in the Marine Corps, and I'm like,

658
00:37:21.22 --> 00:37:25.34
I didn't do a lot of these things until you kind of explain that last part.

659
00:37:25.34 --> 00:37:30.14
I was even thinking about your explanation of the previous chapter of the inspection of your

660
00:37:30.14 --> 00:37:35.42
range safety program, and you like, hey, I kind of sure to made this a priority, and I'm like,

661
00:37:35.42 --> 00:37:42.62
man, I'm not here to say, I want to be really careful, like you said, like, what he's saying

662
00:37:42.62 --> 00:37:47.22
is right, but I honestly don't think I ever inspected anything.

663
00:37:47.22 --> 00:37:49.22
I really don't think I did that.

664
00:37:49.22 --> 00:37:53.50
And what I keep coming back to is what he just described in my brain.

665
00:37:53.50 --> 00:37:58.58
I just keep going to this connection of decentralized command and culture.

666
00:37:58.58 --> 00:38:05.54
I know I created a culture by which everybody on my team understood that what they did was

667
00:38:05.54 --> 00:38:07.10
critical.

668
00:38:07.10 --> 00:38:11.38
And I also knew my people well enough to know what they did.

669
00:38:11.38 --> 00:38:12.78
And so I had an admin shop too.

670
00:38:12.78 --> 00:38:18.46
I had a same group of admin Marines, which their job was admin Marines.

671
00:38:18.46 --> 00:38:24.34
I actually didn't know the 39 things on the admin checklist sets of requirements.

672
00:38:24.34 --> 00:38:25.34
You know who did?

673
00:38:25.34 --> 00:38:26.98
My admin chief did.

674
00:38:26.98 --> 00:38:31.78
And I spent enough time with him to make him know that those things were critical, even

675
00:38:31.78 --> 00:38:35.26
though I didn't know any of them individually the way he did.

676
00:38:35.26 --> 00:38:38.74
And I'm thinking, like, how many times did somebody come in and check out my admin shop?

677
00:38:38.74 --> 00:38:39.90
And I was like, how do we do?

678
00:38:39.90 --> 00:38:41.74
It's like, sure, what do you mean?

679
00:38:41.74 --> 00:38:42.74
How do we crush it?

680
00:38:42.74 --> 00:38:43.94
We're totally good to go.

681
00:38:43.94 --> 00:38:48.06
We had no hits, no deviations or whatever.

682
00:38:48.06 --> 00:38:50.50
It wasn't because I ever inspected his shop.

683
00:38:50.50 --> 00:38:52.90
And I'm running through this thing like, man, I didn't have a checklist for inspection

684
00:38:52.90 --> 00:38:54.78
of my squadron.

685
00:38:54.78 --> 00:39:00.94
But my squadron was kind of awesome because the people all knew, hey, hey, Marines, we own

686
00:39:00.94 --> 00:39:01.94
these things.

687
00:39:01.94 --> 00:39:04.14
Nobody else in the squadron does these things but us.

688
00:39:04.14 --> 00:39:07.30
And these things have to be squared away because at some point somebody's going to come

689
00:39:07.30 --> 00:39:08.30
in.

690
00:39:08.30 --> 00:39:11.30
So I'm just going to assess somebody's going to measure or evaluate and we owe this to the

691
00:39:11.30 --> 00:39:14.14
squadron because if we can't do this, it's going to affect this and we're not going to

692
00:39:14.14 --> 00:39:15.14
fire points.

693
00:39:15.14 --> 00:39:17.46
And the skipper needs us to fire points.

694
00:39:17.46 --> 00:39:23.02
And I'm trying to think of a way to say it without disagreeing with what he's saying

695
00:39:23.02 --> 00:39:27.46
until he got to the end, which was, hey, here's my job as a leader.

696
00:39:27.46 --> 00:39:28.46
We have a problem.

697
00:39:28.46 --> 00:39:29.46
We need to solve this problem.

698
00:39:29.46 --> 00:39:31.62
You know who's going to solve this problem?

699
00:39:31.62 --> 00:39:34.38
You, I don't know how to, I have no idea to fix that.

700
00:39:34.38 --> 00:39:37.18
And then when you're done, you're going to come to me and I'm going to go, okay, that

701
00:39:37.18 --> 00:39:38.18
makes sense.

702
00:39:38.18 --> 00:39:40.66
Here's what we're going to do to make sure this happens.

703
00:39:40.66 --> 00:39:43.86
And so that thing is actually pulled the threat of the previous two chapters together.

704
00:39:43.86 --> 00:39:47.42
I'm over and going, I think I might have sucked as a leader because I'm going

705
00:39:47.42 --> 00:39:48.42
to do anything.

706
00:39:48.42 --> 00:39:51.58
I didn't do any of those things he had describing until he pulled it together, which was

707
00:39:51.58 --> 00:39:55.10
they are the ones that are solving all those problems.

708
00:39:55.10 --> 00:39:56.10
So it's kind of a relief.

709
00:39:56.10 --> 00:39:59.06
And I'm not here to say, I'm not here to say, do what I did.

710
00:39:59.06 --> 00:40:03.14
I'm just kind of almost embarrassed like, yeah, I didn't do any inspections as a squadron

711
00:40:03.14 --> 00:40:09.02
commander at a time where there was more scrutiny on my command than probably any squadron

712
00:40:09.02 --> 00:40:13.58
in the, possibly the military because of how high profile it was.

713
00:40:13.58 --> 00:40:17.38
And I'm thinking, should I've been running around inspecting all my people?

714
00:40:17.38 --> 00:40:23.78
Well, I'll answer for that for you in my opinion, because it sounds like you and I did the

715
00:40:23.78 --> 00:40:26.02
exact same freaking thick, right?

716
00:40:26.02 --> 00:40:28.18
You and I did the exact same freaking thing.

717
00:40:28.18 --> 00:40:37.02
Now, the reason that I regret that I never inspected my admin departments tracking of

718
00:40:37.02 --> 00:40:40.54
RS or the reason I regret that there's two reasons.

719
00:40:40.54 --> 00:40:46.06
Number one, when it came, when that inspection came on announced inspection, I was like,

720
00:40:46.06 --> 00:40:48.66
fingers are crossed, I have no idea.

721
00:40:48.66 --> 00:40:53.46
And if I was a Batman, I wouldn't have bet on the wind.

722
00:40:53.46 --> 00:40:57.50
I wouldn't have bet on the, I wouldn't have bet on zero.

723
00:40:57.50 --> 00:40:58.50
Yeah, no deviation.

724
00:40:58.50 --> 00:41:00.98
Zero deviations, which is what we got.

725
00:41:00.98 --> 00:41:03.90
So I'm, I don't like that.

726
00:41:03.90 --> 00:41:10.62
But even more important than that is I had people that worked for me that did an exceptional

727
00:41:10.62 --> 00:41:13.94
job, an exceptional job.

728
00:41:13.94 --> 00:41:19.90
I never gave them, I mean, look, after the after we got randomly, if they were, if

729
00:41:19.90 --> 00:41:24.62
that inspection never would have happened, I never would have given them any credit, right?

730
00:41:24.62 --> 00:41:30.98
I never, so I'm, I, I, I would have gone back in time if I could do it again.

731
00:41:30.98 --> 00:41:31.98
You know what I do?

732
00:41:31.98 --> 00:41:34.70
As I go, hey, guys, I'm going to come and check out some of the stuff in admin today.

733
00:41:34.70 --> 00:41:35.70
Yeah.

734
00:41:35.70 --> 00:41:41.46
And I want to say, show me these RS, show me these, give me, hey, Smith Jones and white.

735
00:41:41.46 --> 00:41:44.18
Let me there, RSO records right now.

736
00:41:44.18 --> 00:41:47.18
They pull them out and I go, man, you guys are on top of things.

737
00:41:47.18 --> 00:41:48.18
Thank you.

738
00:41:48.18 --> 00:41:49.54
Thank you.

739
00:41:49.54 --> 00:41:51.78
And now I'm just that much better.

740
00:41:51.78 --> 00:41:56.62
So that's why I feel like inspections is a tool, not so much a tool to make sure that

741
00:41:56.62 --> 00:41:59.22
people are doing, it's a, it's a, it's a connection.

742
00:41:59.22 --> 00:42:00.22
Yes.

743
00:42:00.22 --> 00:42:01.98
It's an opportunity to compliment people.

744
00:42:01.98 --> 00:42:08.02
It's an opportunity for, hey, man, if I never inspect those things, how important is

745
00:42:08.02 --> 00:42:10.14
it to me?

746
00:42:10.14 --> 00:42:12.14
Not not, it's not very important, obviously.

747
00:42:12.14 --> 00:42:13.14
Yeah.

748
00:42:13.14 --> 00:42:16.14
Guess what, when the, when my commanding officer comes over to inspect, guess how important

749
00:42:16.14 --> 00:42:18.14
it's number one thing on my free list.

750
00:42:18.14 --> 00:42:24.14
And I had, I had, I only, here's the next part.

751
00:42:24.14 --> 00:42:28.14
Pup, pup.

752
00:42:28.14 --> 00:42:37.14
What trumps above inspections in the hierarchy of leadership is obviously culture.

753
00:42:37.14 --> 00:42:43.34
So you, at your squadron and, and I'll give you some credit, but I will give free

754
00:42:43.34 --> 00:42:48.74
can credit to the good old United States Marine Corps, which is you never set a word, but

755
00:42:48.74 --> 00:42:51.18
those Marines knew this is my job.

756
00:42:51.18 --> 00:42:52.70
I will be freaking ready.

757
00:42:52.70 --> 00:42:53.70
This is what I do.

758
00:42:53.70 --> 00:42:58.46
So there's a culture inside the Marine Corps, which you enhanced inside your squadron

759
00:42:58.46 --> 00:43:01.14
that everybody knew this is what we do.

760
00:43:01.14 --> 00:43:02.70
That's what we're looking for.

761
00:43:02.70 --> 00:43:04.14
That's what we're trying to do.

762
00:43:04.14 --> 00:43:05.14
Yeah.

763
00:43:05.14 --> 00:43:08.62
And hopefully we don't have to inspect as a negative, hopefully we inspect

764
00:43:08.62 --> 00:43:09.62
it in a positive way.

765
00:43:09.62 --> 00:43:10.62
Yeah.

766
00:43:10.62 --> 00:43:13.62
And I think that's the genius of what he's saying as I'm thinking about it is that,

767
00:43:13.62 --> 00:43:17.90
if you hear the word inspection, 99 people out of 100, that's a negative word.

768
00:43:17.90 --> 00:43:18.90
That's a bad word.

769
00:43:18.90 --> 00:43:21.22
The inspection is not something you want.

770
00:43:21.22 --> 00:43:22.58
We don't, I don't want to be inspected.

771
00:43:22.58 --> 00:43:24.14
There's a negative connotation.

772
00:43:24.14 --> 00:43:26.14
And the negative connotation is true.

773
00:43:26.14 --> 00:43:29.54
If the things your people are doing wrong is a reflection of them and the things your

774
00:43:29.54 --> 00:43:31.14
people doing right is a reflection of you.

775
00:43:31.14 --> 00:43:33.66
And he's saying the exact opposite.

776
00:43:33.66 --> 00:43:36.26
The things your people are doing right is a reflection of them and you should tell them

777
00:43:36.26 --> 00:43:37.26
they're doing awesome.

778
00:43:37.26 --> 00:43:40.66
And the things they're doing wrong is a reflection of you.

779
00:43:40.66 --> 00:43:41.66
Yeah.

780
00:43:41.66 --> 00:43:47.46
And that alone just reversing what it actually means to inspect and the conclusion of that.

781
00:43:47.46 --> 00:43:51.78
And that I think has been the part I've been wrestling with this whole time listening to it.

782
00:43:51.78 --> 00:43:58.06
And when what he's saying is exactly opposite of the standard connotation of inspection.

783
00:43:58.06 --> 00:43:59.50
So anyway, that's pretty cool.

784
00:43:59.50 --> 00:44:04.50
The sections should be positive, not negative.

785
00:44:04.50 --> 00:44:15.26
Chapter seven, leadership, commander ship, general ship.

786
00:44:15.26 --> 00:44:19.70
And then in quotes, follow a ship.

787
00:44:19.70 --> 00:44:24.58
I can assure you that it's, and so this is addressed to students of the command and general

788
00:44:24.58 --> 00:44:29.46
staff college, Fort Levenworth, Kansas, 1962 to 1963 course.

789
00:44:29.46 --> 00:44:34.62
He printed with permission from Armour Magazine.

790
00:44:34.62 --> 00:44:35.78
Why don't I subscribe?

791
00:44:35.78 --> 00:44:41.46
Why don't I have a subscription to Armour Magazine?

792
00:44:41.46 --> 00:44:42.46
Here we go.

793
00:44:42.46 --> 00:44:46.10
I can assure you that it's a great privilege for me to return to the command and general

794
00:44:46.10 --> 00:44:50.26
staff college even though this is the first time I have been permitted to be on this platform

795
00:44:50.26 --> 00:44:51.26
in civilian clothes.

796
00:44:51.26 --> 00:44:54.90
I've been here over a long period of time from time to time.

797
00:44:54.90 --> 00:44:56.86
I entered here as a student 24 years ago.

798
00:44:56.86 --> 00:45:00.62
I've taken great interest in the command and general staff college because I was able to work

799
00:45:00.62 --> 00:45:03.86
in the field of Army education on several occasions.

800
00:45:03.86 --> 00:45:09.10
I don't know that there's any institution in America that is so favorably known worldwide

801
00:45:09.10 --> 00:45:12.86
in military circles as your college.

802
00:45:12.86 --> 00:45:17.54
And while I can't think of many things that I contributed to the college, I did contribute

803
00:45:17.54 --> 00:45:19.42
one thing that I think was important.

804
00:45:19.42 --> 00:45:22.98
You can see he's got a little, little humility.

805
00:45:22.98 --> 00:45:26.62
I can't think of anything I've done, but it's one thing that I think was important.

806
00:45:26.62 --> 00:45:33.10
I was responsible for changing the name of it from the command and general staff school

807
00:45:33.10 --> 00:45:36.94
to the command and general staff college.

808
00:45:36.94 --> 00:45:43.34
You might think that to be a play in the semantics, but it isn't.

809
00:45:43.34 --> 00:45:47.82
It's important because after all, you gentlemen here are getting the equivalent of your

810
00:45:47.82 --> 00:45:50.54
master's degree in your profession.

811
00:45:50.54 --> 00:45:52.82
I wanted to just talk to you with you this morning.

812
00:45:52.82 --> 00:45:54.66
I didn't come here to deliver a lecture.

813
00:45:54.66 --> 00:45:58.26
I came to talk to you about certain aspects of the job that you're learning to do.

814
00:45:58.26 --> 00:46:02.58
After all, this is the command and general staff college and that name was not arrived

815
00:46:02.58 --> 00:46:04.38
without some thought.

816
00:46:04.38 --> 00:46:08.02
And of course, it sets forth your mission for being here.

817
00:46:08.02 --> 00:46:14.26
I was a troop commander for 13 straight years before I retired.

818
00:46:14.26 --> 00:46:20.70
And that encompasses the career of a great many people, a great many of you people.

819
00:46:20.70 --> 00:46:25.46
So that I didn't come here today to play over again the record that I think a lot of you

820
00:46:25.46 --> 00:46:28.14
have heard me play many times.

821
00:46:28.14 --> 00:46:31.38
You have heard a very good course at the college and leadership.

822
00:46:31.38 --> 00:46:36.10
And I assure you that I'll not repeat that or go into the attributes that are required

823
00:46:36.10 --> 00:46:37.10
in the field of leadership.

824
00:46:37.10 --> 00:46:38.90
I think they are very well known.

825
00:46:38.90 --> 00:46:41.02
They're really not very complicated.

826
00:46:41.02 --> 00:46:44.90
The art of leadership is only complicated to theorists.

827
00:46:44.90 --> 00:46:47.26
It's not complicated to practical men.

828
00:46:47.26 --> 00:46:51.50
There are only a few really, a very few simple rules and precepts that build the makeup

829
00:46:51.50 --> 00:46:56.38
of character that are necessary to be better than a satisfactory leader.

830
00:46:56.38 --> 00:47:01.74
And I'm sure that each one of you has passed that qualification or else you wouldn't be here.

831
00:47:01.74 --> 00:47:05.50
I would like to go further into this particular field and point out to you that I believe

832
00:47:05.50 --> 00:47:13.58
we have become an exact and in exact in the use of terminology because I was reading last

833
00:47:13.58 --> 00:47:20.02
night a memorandum which said that we teach leadership at the command and general staff college

834
00:47:20.02 --> 00:47:22.70
from the level of the division commander up.

835
00:47:22.70 --> 00:47:29.90
I take issue with that statement for the reason that leadership is a peculiar art or a technique

836
00:47:29.90 --> 00:47:36.82
in itself and a division commander is not basically a leader.

837
00:47:36.82 --> 00:47:39.26
He is a commander.

838
00:47:39.26 --> 00:47:44.06
And I'm going to point out to you that you should be adjusting your thinking to a different

839
00:47:44.06 --> 00:47:45.06
point of view.

840
00:47:45.06 --> 00:47:51.22
I will talk to you briefly about what I call commander ship and general ship which are quite

841
00:47:51.22 --> 00:47:54.70
different from being a leader.

842
00:47:54.70 --> 00:47:55.70
Pretty interesting, right?

843
00:47:55.70 --> 00:47:56.70
Yeah.

844
00:47:56.70 --> 00:47:57.70
I this one got my attention man.

845
00:47:57.70 --> 00:47:58.70
I'm reading this.

846
00:47:58.70 --> 00:47:59.70
I'm like, ooh wait a second, where are we going?

847
00:47:59.70 --> 00:48:00.70
Where is he going?

848
00:48:00.70 --> 00:48:02.42
Where is he going?

849
00:48:02.42 --> 00:48:08.14
If you will go to the title of the people who you are in charge of in military echelons

850
00:48:08.14 --> 00:48:16.14
starting at the bottom, you'll first come to a squad leader, then a platoon leader.

851
00:48:16.14 --> 00:48:22.38
And every other title after that has the word commander.

852
00:48:22.38 --> 00:48:28.18
So for those of you who don't know, you got a fire team leader, you got a squad leader,

853
00:48:28.18 --> 00:48:37.14
you got a platoon leader, and then you get to a company commander or even a task unit commander.

854
00:48:37.14 --> 00:48:38.46
Why was that done?

855
00:48:38.46 --> 00:48:40.02
There are no company leaders.

856
00:48:40.02 --> 00:48:42.46
There are no battalion leaders.

857
00:48:42.46 --> 00:48:45.90
There are only company battalion brigade commanders.

858
00:48:45.90 --> 00:48:49.50
And then you get to division commanding generals, which is a further progression.

859
00:48:49.50 --> 00:48:53.18
I'd like to point out to you that I hope you all will graduate with an appreciation of

860
00:48:53.18 --> 00:48:59.06
the transition that is necessary to go from leadership to commander ship.

861
00:48:59.06 --> 00:49:05.18
I hope you don't think this old man now is involved in semantics because I hope I'm not.

862
00:49:05.18 --> 00:49:09.90
It's really an important thing and a lot of people have never bridged it.

863
00:49:09.90 --> 00:49:15.42
They're still exercising leadership as company commanders or even as they get higher.

864
00:49:15.42 --> 00:49:23.86
And by doing so, they're bypassing or poorly using their subordinate commanders and staffs.

865
00:49:23.86 --> 00:49:24.78
Just to take a break.

866
00:49:24.78 --> 00:49:30.58
So I've talked about this many times.

867
00:49:30.58 --> 00:49:37.26
There are people that do a great platoon commander.

868
00:49:37.26 --> 00:49:39.74
Task unit commander is not quite there.

869
00:49:39.74 --> 00:49:42.34
Seal team commander, they're not good.

870
00:49:42.34 --> 00:49:49.22
We've worked with businesses where you had this CEO, founder.

871
00:49:49.22 --> 00:49:50.50
Like this one we see a lot.

872
00:49:50.50 --> 00:49:52.14
Founder slash CEO.

873
00:49:52.14 --> 00:49:56.98
Hey, does an amazing job forming that business building that business?

874
00:49:56.98 --> 00:49:59.78
All of a sudden it's time to really grow.

875
00:49:59.78 --> 00:50:02.50
They can't make the transition.

876
00:50:02.50 --> 00:50:04.10
They don't make the transition.

877
00:50:04.10 --> 00:50:12.14
And they have to bring in a new person to be the CEO, a person with these other attributes.

878
00:50:12.14 --> 00:50:16.26
So this is something that's, all I was thinking about is, oh, okay.

879
00:50:16.26 --> 00:50:20.18
I remember the CEO that brought the company, brought this particular company through this

880
00:50:20.18 --> 00:50:25.02
particular situation and then got to that level and they had to move them into some

881
00:50:25.02 --> 00:50:30.62
different role and they had to bring in somebody that had this next, this next level of

882
00:50:30.62 --> 00:50:35.62
leadership characteristics.

883
00:50:35.62 --> 00:50:40.38
Continuing on, you came here to learn commander ship or general ship and that involves

884
00:50:40.38 --> 00:50:45.94
the proper organization and utilization of subordinate commanders and staffs to establish

885
00:50:45.94 --> 00:50:49.30
what you want done with your command.

886
00:50:49.30 --> 00:50:53.86
And the technique is much different than the technique of getting in front of a platoon

887
00:50:53.86 --> 00:50:59.74
and saying follow me, which is leadership.

888
00:50:59.74 --> 00:51:03.50
But when you're in a different position with reference to your soldiers, then you become

889
00:51:03.50 --> 00:51:09.26
more or less a director and the technique of a director ship is far different than the

890
00:51:09.26 --> 00:51:11.46
technique of saying follow me.

891
00:51:11.46 --> 00:51:16.82
I'm so glad he gave a, he broke this down.

892
00:51:16.82 --> 00:51:19.98
I will give you an illustration.

893
00:51:19.98 --> 00:51:27.78
Who's you have a horse at a point a that you want to move to point b?

894
00:51:27.78 --> 00:51:33.02
You take hold of the halter shank and he follows you down the road, you're the leader.

895
00:51:33.02 --> 00:51:34.02
So there you go.

896
00:51:34.02 --> 00:51:36.14
Hey, that's what you are.

897
00:51:36.14 --> 00:51:40.86
You take that bridal and you, lead this thing down the road, you're the leader.

898
00:51:40.86 --> 00:51:47.86
But if you get on and ride him, you use different techniques, you use different aids,

899
00:51:47.86 --> 00:51:51.86
you use your legs and other things that I learned in the ancient days when we had writing

900
00:51:51.86 --> 00:51:54.46
at West Point to accomplish your purpose.

901
00:51:54.46 --> 00:51:59.38
And I would say that might be termed commander ship.

902
00:51:59.38 --> 00:52:01.54
You're then the commander of the horse.

903
00:52:01.54 --> 00:52:08.10
You're not as leader, but the purpose is the same to move him from a to b.

904
00:52:08.10 --> 00:52:14.32
Now if you're affluent enough to own a sulky and I had to look up sulky, I had no idea

905
00:52:14.32 --> 00:52:16.66
of sulky as a carriage.

906
00:52:16.66 --> 00:52:19.54
It can be a one person carriage, but it's two wheels.

907
00:52:19.54 --> 00:52:26.14
If you're affluent enough to own a sulky and drive him with the reins and with a whip

908
00:52:26.14 --> 00:52:29.74
in your hand, then that's general ship.

909
00:52:29.74 --> 00:52:33.02
And I bring that up because it isn't too far fetched in the problem that I would like

910
00:52:33.02 --> 00:52:36.06
to bring with you.

911
00:52:36.06 --> 00:52:41.30
I will give you a historical example of a fellow who was tremendous leader during the

912
00:52:41.30 --> 00:52:44.90
civil war, perhaps one of the greatest leaders of the civil war.

913
00:52:44.90 --> 00:52:49.22
And I use that term in the sense that I have used it up to now.

914
00:52:49.22 --> 00:52:50.62
So he's talking about a leader.

915
00:52:50.62 --> 00:52:54.78
One of the greatest leaders, but he's saying in the term that I'm using a great leader in

916
00:52:54.78 --> 00:52:59.02
the civil war was Hood, who commanded the Texas Brigade.

917
00:52:59.02 --> 00:53:04.86
He was a most fantastic troop leader and sometimes if you'd like to look into a further,

918
00:53:04.86 --> 00:53:11.30
there's a very good book entitled The Galen Hood, Hood was a leader of the old school.

919
00:53:11.30 --> 00:53:16.90
And front of his men with a saber in his hand, that's how he handled his brigade and it

920
00:53:16.90 --> 00:53:19.30
was an effective organization.

921
00:53:19.30 --> 00:53:22.98
It was inevitable that a man with such capabilities would be promoted.

922
00:53:22.98 --> 00:53:24.98
He went up rapidly throughout the war.

923
00:53:24.98 --> 00:53:31.22
He ranked next to Lee at the end of the war, but when the war was over, he had lost command.

924
00:53:31.22 --> 00:53:36.70
It was a sorry ending to a man who had never mastered the transition from leadership to

925
00:53:36.70 --> 00:53:40.42
commander ship to general ship.

926
00:53:40.42 --> 00:53:46.86
And you move into the field of commander ship as against the field of leadership, you

927
00:53:46.86 --> 00:53:51.02
go to the techniques or the arc of how you use your subordinate commanders to get the

928
00:53:51.02 --> 00:53:57.38
most out of them, the art and the technique of how you organize and use your staff in order

929
00:53:57.38 --> 00:54:02.98
to enable you to carry out the job of directing, organizing and handling operations.

930
00:54:02.98 --> 00:54:11.98
So I'm just going to, I'm going to wrap through this whole thing because there's so much

931
00:54:11.98 --> 00:54:12.98
to talk about.

932
00:54:12.98 --> 00:54:17.70
And I'm going to let me pause.

933
00:54:17.70 --> 00:54:21.54
This is what I find interesting.

934
00:54:21.54 --> 00:54:24.46
And he's going to come back to it, but I'll give you a foreshadowing.

935
00:54:24.46 --> 00:54:28.74
He's going to come back to it.

936
00:54:28.74 --> 00:54:34.14
I think that as he looks back at his career, I got to remember this guy joined when

937
00:54:34.14 --> 00:54:40.94
he was when he was a kid and he was in a world war one and think about how things changed

938
00:54:40.94 --> 00:54:44.42
by his own admission in between the world war one and world.

939
00:54:44.42 --> 00:54:51.98
So when he was a world war one and post world war one, he was in his mind this leader,

940
00:54:51.98 --> 00:54:52.98
right?

941
00:54:52.98 --> 00:54:53.98
That was going to lead from the front.

942
00:54:53.98 --> 00:54:55.82
That was going to make things happen.

943
00:54:55.82 --> 00:55:00.86
Because the nature of war became more dispersed.

944
00:55:00.86 --> 00:55:06.18
All of a sudden you had to have a little something that we called decentralized command.

945
00:55:06.18 --> 00:55:08.70
He can't be in front of his unit the whole time.

946
00:55:08.70 --> 00:55:11.62
And that would be the same.

947
00:55:11.62 --> 00:55:21.94
And I think as he became more mature and as he got older, hey look, when you took a, well,

948
00:55:21.94 --> 00:55:22.94
it's kind of hard.

949
00:55:22.94 --> 00:55:24.54
Well, I talk about this with life.

950
00:55:24.54 --> 00:55:31.58
People say like, hey, I wish I would have done X, Y and Z when I was the assistant

951
00:55:31.58 --> 00:55:33.58
platoon commander.

952
00:55:33.58 --> 00:55:36.58
Lave could write a book about the things he wish it would have changed when he was

953
00:55:36.58 --> 00:55:38.34
a assistant platoon commander for sure.

954
00:55:38.34 --> 00:55:43.58
He was fresh out of the fleet, you know, naval academy fleet and now it's on, he's

955
00:55:43.58 --> 00:55:44.98
an, he's an assiopton.

956
00:55:44.98 --> 00:55:45.98
Right?

957
00:55:45.98 --> 00:55:51.46
Do you think that if he went back and did that right now, do you think he would do things

958
00:55:51.46 --> 00:55:54.46
a little bit differently?

959
00:55:54.46 --> 00:55:55.46
Absolutely.

960
00:55:55.46 --> 00:55:56.46
We all would.

961
00:55:56.46 --> 00:55:57.46
Yeah.

962
00:55:57.46 --> 00:55:58.46
We all would do that.

963
00:55:58.46 --> 00:56:04.02
And so here we have a guy that went through the entire rank structure of the army, the

964
00:56:04.02 --> 00:56:07.34
entire thing.

965
00:56:07.34 --> 00:56:16.14
And as he got older and got better and got more experienced, I would think he'd say, this

966
00:56:16.14 --> 00:56:20.70
is what I should have done when I was a platoon commander, but I didn't.

967
00:56:20.70 --> 00:56:22.30
And here's what I would do differently.

968
00:56:22.30 --> 00:56:27.06
But maybe because the wars were different and it was more centralized and it wasn't dispersed,

969
00:56:27.06 --> 00:56:28.30
everyone was together.

970
00:56:28.30 --> 00:56:36.58
So there's a, there's a, I think what I see is him is him saying listen, it was, it's

971
00:56:36.58 --> 00:56:40.78
a different thing, whereas I look at it now and say wait a second, it might have been a

972
00:56:40.78 --> 00:56:42.62
different thing for you.

973
00:56:42.62 --> 00:56:48.46
But if you could go back knowing what you learned eventually, you might say, hey, I actually

974
00:56:48.46 --> 00:56:51.22
would have led differently.

975
00:56:51.22 --> 00:56:59.46
Now tell you right now, even in a platoon, even in a freaking squad, even in a fire team.

976
00:56:59.46 --> 00:57:05.62
The techniques that he's going to talk about, what's better, if you're in charge of a

977
00:57:05.62 --> 00:57:11.74
platoon, what's better, grab in the grabbing the reins and pulling them down, or is it better

978
00:57:11.74 --> 00:57:15.14
to guide them and let them run?

979
00:57:15.14 --> 00:57:16.14
Yeah.

980
00:57:16.14 --> 00:57:18.54
The answer is so obvious.

981
00:57:18.54 --> 00:57:25.10
But he digs in a little bit, chain responsibility.

982
00:57:25.10 --> 00:57:30.54
And also you must realize, as you go up in various echelons of organization of the army,

983
00:57:30.54 --> 00:57:34.50
from the squad on up, you become increasingly removed from the individual soldiers and

984
00:57:34.50 --> 00:57:38.90
your influence on the individual soldier is no longer carried by an eyeball to eyeball approach.

985
00:57:38.90 --> 00:57:44.90
It is carried on through the echelons of your command down to him and you become increasingly

986
00:57:44.90 --> 00:57:52.10
just an image to him, which you develop in several ways, but you get to the field of proper

987
00:57:52.10 --> 00:57:56.14
staff organization and staff relationship because that is very important, part of command

988
00:57:56.14 --> 00:57:57.62
or ship and general ship.

989
00:57:57.62 --> 00:57:58.98
What is that saying?

990
00:57:58.98 --> 00:58:03.30
What it's saying is when you're in a leadership position, as you go up in ranks, you

991
00:58:03.30 --> 00:58:06.50
right, you don't have eyeball to eyeball at any all the time.

992
00:58:06.50 --> 00:58:09.06
Guess who you do have eyeball to eyeball with?

993
00:58:09.06 --> 00:58:10.70
You're a subordinate leader.

994
00:58:10.70 --> 00:58:15.10
And your subordinate leaders have to nurture those close personal relationships with their

995
00:58:15.10 --> 00:58:20.38
troops, so that that influence that you have as the commander is felt all the way down

996
00:58:20.38 --> 00:58:24.38
through the front lines.

997
00:58:24.38 --> 00:58:25.38
Back to the book.

998
00:58:25.38 --> 00:58:29.14
In your recent military review, there's an article on faulty staff relationships.

999
00:58:29.14 --> 00:58:33.50
I hope it will cause you to give a little thought to that problem because it is important

1000
00:58:33.50 --> 00:58:34.50
one.

1001
00:58:34.50 --> 00:58:38.74
You come to one of the most important parts of commander ship and leadership, and that is establishing

1002
00:58:38.74 --> 00:58:40.58
a chain of responsibility.

1003
00:58:40.58 --> 00:58:46.22
So that every man in your organization knows who he works for and who works for him.

1004
00:58:46.22 --> 00:58:47.22
That's cool.

1005
00:58:47.22 --> 00:58:48.22
I get that.

1006
00:58:48.22 --> 00:58:51.22
Wait, that's called a chain of command.

1007
00:58:51.22 --> 00:58:53.46
That is basic.

1008
00:58:53.46 --> 00:58:58.34
How many organizations have you been in where that wasn't known?

1009
00:58:58.34 --> 00:58:59.66
I've been in several.

1010
00:58:59.66 --> 00:59:06.46
I had no idea who I worked for or who out who or who made out my efficiency report.

1011
00:59:06.46 --> 00:59:10.54
After all, and this is one of those things where I get a little cringy.

1012
00:59:10.54 --> 00:59:15.62
As my kids, as my daughters would say, after all, there's one basic rule in the army that

1013
00:59:15.62 --> 00:59:17.34
you can't violate.

1014
00:59:17.34 --> 00:59:21.34
And I over a period of 44 years have tried to violate many of them.

1015
00:59:21.34 --> 00:59:25.34
I've been successful in a few, but this one I have never been successful in.

1016
00:59:25.34 --> 00:59:31.50
And that is you work and devote your loyalty to the man who makes out your efficiency

1017
00:59:31.50 --> 00:59:35.46
report and the man who endorses it.

1018
00:59:35.46 --> 00:59:38.70
If you don't do that, you're never going to be a general.

1019
00:59:38.70 --> 00:59:45.14
So to me, this is wrong.

1020
00:59:45.14 --> 00:59:50.34
To me, relationships are stronger than the chain of command.

1021
00:59:50.34 --> 00:59:51.74
And luckily he's going to counter this.

1022
00:59:51.74 --> 00:59:52.74
He's going to counter this.

1023
00:59:52.74 --> 00:59:53.74
He's going to counter this.

1024
00:59:53.74 --> 00:59:54.74
Of course.

1025
00:59:54.74 --> 01:00:02.02
The establishing a chain of responsibility is just as important.

1026
01:00:02.02 --> 01:00:06.18
And look, this is proven out by hack worth who built these incredible relationships and

1027
01:00:06.18 --> 01:00:08.78
that's how we ran things.

1028
01:00:08.78 --> 01:00:11.58
Establishing a chain of responsibilities just as important in your staff as it is in your

1029
01:00:11.58 --> 01:00:12.58
command.

1030
01:00:12.58 --> 01:00:17.30
If you don't have that, your headquarters mills around and creates what I call command and

1031
01:00:17.30 --> 01:00:19.54
staff inertia.

1032
01:00:19.54 --> 01:00:24.22
That is a state of frustration and lack of purpose that exists in many military staffs.

1033
01:00:24.22 --> 01:00:25.62
Okay.

1034
01:00:25.62 --> 01:00:27.86
People got to know what people got to know with the chain of command.

1035
01:00:27.86 --> 01:00:29.58
For sure.

1036
01:00:29.58 --> 01:00:34.70
Then of course, it comes down to the art of command or ship or general ship as to how you

1037
01:00:34.70 --> 01:00:39.62
issue your directives or how you project your desires and will down through the chain of

1038
01:00:39.62 --> 01:00:40.62
command.

1039
01:00:40.62 --> 01:00:43.66
Oh, desire, I read that wrong.

1040
01:00:43.66 --> 01:00:48.54
As to how you issue your directives or how you project your desires and will down through

1041
01:00:48.54 --> 01:00:54.50
the chain of command, it comes out in directives and so forth, which is an art within itself.

1042
01:00:54.50 --> 01:00:57.66
And which I am sorry to say, we sometimes don't do very well.

1043
01:00:57.66 --> 01:01:02.10
We could do a lot better when we're doing that in the field.

1044
01:01:02.10 --> 01:01:07.18
I've worked at times for a commander for whom I felt I wasn't doing a good job because

1045
01:01:07.18 --> 01:01:12.82
the truth of the matter was I didn't know what he wanted me to accomplish.

1046
01:01:12.82 --> 01:01:14.82
Okay.

1047
01:01:14.82 --> 01:01:19.06
Second law of combat, simple, simple clear and concise.

1048
01:01:19.06 --> 01:01:21.42
If I don't know what you want me to do, there's no way I can accomplish it.

1049
01:01:21.42 --> 01:01:23.34
And by the way, who's fault is that?

1050
01:01:23.34 --> 01:01:24.34
It's my fault.

1051
01:01:24.34 --> 01:01:27.86
If I don't know what my boss wants me to accomplish, what do I do?

1052
01:01:27.86 --> 01:01:30.26
I raise my hand and ask my boss, what do you want me to accomplish?

1053
01:01:30.26 --> 01:01:31.26
What's the mission here?

1054
01:01:31.26 --> 01:01:32.26
Get done.

1055
01:01:32.26 --> 01:01:33.26
What's the end date?

1056
01:01:33.26 --> 01:01:37.58
What's your intent?

1057
01:01:37.58 --> 01:01:39.02
Next section, improving your unit.

1058
01:01:39.02 --> 01:01:41.34
Now we get to the point of making progress as a commander.

1059
01:01:41.34 --> 01:01:46.46
I can't conceive of anybody who takes over a company, a batallion, a brigade or division,

1060
01:01:46.46 --> 01:01:50.98
a corps, a field army who doesn't sit down and say to himself, how I impress upon my

1061
01:01:50.98 --> 01:01:57.94
superiors, the men who make out my efficiency report that I am a good commander.

1062
01:01:57.94 --> 01:02:00.14
Once again, you know, you get a little bit of that.

1063
01:02:00.14 --> 01:02:05.02
I'm looking to get promoted, which I don't like.

1064
01:02:05.02 --> 01:02:06.94
How do I do that?

1065
01:02:06.94 --> 01:02:10.90
I've seen it done every way that you can think of in my career, but I would suggest to

1066
01:02:10.90 --> 01:02:15.74
you that the best way to do it in the military organization is through a little exercise

1067
01:02:15.74 --> 01:02:22.58
of what I call, is through the exercise of what I call little pluses of making a little

1068
01:02:22.58 --> 01:02:25.26
progress in every field every day.

1069
01:02:25.26 --> 01:02:29.18
Over a period of time, if you do that, your organization will tighten up.

1070
01:02:29.18 --> 01:02:33.82
Your organization will become good and you'll gradually come up with the understanding and

1071
01:02:33.82 --> 01:02:38.46
the reputation of really being a good commander.

1072
01:02:38.46 --> 01:02:44.86
You will also not create turbulence, which detracts from the effectiveness of your unit.

1073
01:02:44.86 --> 01:02:48.70
So I like this idea, little things, get a little bit better every day.

1074
01:02:48.70 --> 01:02:51.66
But then he goes into this without that thing when he talks about turbulence, he goes

1075
01:02:51.66 --> 01:02:52.66
into it.

1076
01:02:52.66 --> 01:02:58.86
I've seen people walk into an organization and immediately start to make headlines.

1077
01:02:58.86 --> 01:03:06.86
I would like to point out to you a great truth in the military that he who lives by headlines

1078
01:03:06.86 --> 01:03:09.34
is destroyed by headlines.

1079
01:03:09.34 --> 01:03:14.38
Remember that if you start seeking headlines and creating images of yourself as a Superman,

1080
01:03:14.38 --> 01:03:18.34
pretty soon somebody will find a hole in your armor and when he does he will certainly

1081
01:03:18.34 --> 01:03:20.78
give it to you.

1082
01:03:20.78 --> 01:03:24.42
That follows from the rule about the monkey who climbs up a pole.

1083
01:03:24.42 --> 01:03:29.30
The high re-gits, the more of his rear he shows the people who are below him and that

1084
01:03:29.30 --> 01:03:35.22
often goes for a person who up the chain of command in the echelons of the army.

1085
01:03:35.22 --> 01:03:41.10
So good, that's what I totally agree with that.

1086
01:03:41.10 --> 01:03:42.62
Now he gets into this section.

1087
01:03:42.62 --> 01:03:47.22
It's called channels of suggestion.

1088
01:03:47.22 --> 01:03:51.04
I hope that I have impressed upon you that there is a technique and commander ship and

1089
01:03:51.04 --> 01:03:56.52
general ship, techniques that are different from leadership, although the characteristics

1090
01:03:56.52 --> 01:04:04.56
of the individual as to honesty and sincerity and all those other things are just as applicable.

1091
01:04:04.56 --> 01:04:06.56
So honesty is important.

1092
01:04:06.56 --> 01:04:15.04
Since you have to master the transition as you go up, there is a little depth of different

1093
01:04:15.04 --> 01:04:20.36
technique being a company commander, the not a being a batagon commander.

1094
01:04:20.36 --> 01:04:24.44
You have a bigger staff, you have more senior subordinate commanders as you go up and that

1095
01:04:24.44 --> 01:04:26.68
of course increases.

1096
01:04:26.68 --> 01:04:28.16
We talk about chain of command.

1097
01:04:28.16 --> 01:04:34.40
I have conscientiously tried throughout my career to live and conduct my job in such

1098
01:04:34.40 --> 01:04:42.36
a way that I didn't exercise control of my organization through channels of command.

1099
01:04:42.36 --> 01:04:46.84
I exercised it through channels of suggestion.

1100
01:04:46.84 --> 01:04:51.20
So instead of using the chain of command, he's saying exactly what we say instead of saying,

1101
01:04:51.20 --> 01:04:55.16
look, I'm in charge, I'm the highest rank guy, you're going to do what I say.

1102
01:04:55.16 --> 01:04:57.76
He's saying don't do that.

1103
01:04:57.76 --> 01:05:06.36
As much as I can throughout my career, I've exercised command through channels of suggestion.

1104
01:05:06.36 --> 01:05:11.08
And I have a note here that says, ha, relationships.

1105
01:05:11.08 --> 01:05:16.12
I think it is very important that I only use the channels of command when I wanted to

1106
01:05:16.12 --> 01:05:18.000
discipline somebody.

1107
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.32
And I didn't have to do that very often.

1108
01:05:22.32 --> 01:05:25.80
I figured that if I could, he's just putting himself on report.

1109
01:05:25.80 --> 01:05:29.40
I figured that if I couldn't run an organization by getting things done by suggestion

1110
01:05:29.40 --> 01:05:34.92
that I'd failed as a commander, I commanded the troops of 12 nations as a core commander

1111
01:05:34.92 --> 01:05:35.92
in Korea.

1112
01:05:35.92 --> 01:05:39.32
I didn't have any strong chain of command between me and the allied troops.

1113
01:05:39.32 --> 01:05:43.36
If I put out something that I want to done that violated their national ideas, they didn't

1114
01:05:43.36 --> 01:05:45.16
pay very much attention to it.

1115
01:05:45.16 --> 01:05:47.04
In that case, what are you going to do next?

1116
01:05:47.04 --> 01:05:48.04
Well, guess what?

1117
01:05:48.04 --> 01:05:50.20
You don't have to be a foreign army for that to make sense.

1118
01:05:50.20 --> 01:05:51.48
That happens in a freaking poll tune.

1119
01:05:51.48 --> 01:05:53.40
That happens in a fire team.

1120
01:05:53.40 --> 01:05:57.68
If I come up with dumb ideas that don't make any sense, that are what does he say?

1121
01:05:57.68 --> 01:06:00.08
That violates their ideas.

1122
01:06:00.08 --> 01:06:01.24
And they don't want to do it.

1123
01:06:01.24 --> 01:06:02.68
Oh, you can force them to do it.

1124
01:06:02.68 --> 01:06:06.56
But what does that get you?

1125
01:06:06.56 --> 01:06:10.56
I was down at the infantry school and commented on this not very long ago.

1126
01:06:10.56 --> 01:06:16.68
And one captain got up and said, General, I've listened to very carefully to your channel

1127
01:06:16.68 --> 01:06:18.28
of suggestion approach.

1128
01:06:18.28 --> 01:06:19.52
And I'm familiar with it.

1129
01:06:19.52 --> 01:06:22.000
I served in your command in Europe.

1130
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:29.60
And I think you have to be a very powerful, suggestor to make it work.

1131
01:06:29.60 --> 01:06:32.28
Maybe that's true, he says.

1132
01:06:32.28 --> 01:06:38.88
And the note I have here is, here's a good way to suggest.

1133
01:06:38.88 --> 01:06:41.28
Here's the most powerful way to suggest.

1134
01:06:41.28 --> 01:06:46.20
Listen to your other, when this whole time I'm thinking, is it his suggestions or other

1135
01:06:46.20 --> 01:06:47.44
people's suggestions?

1136
01:06:47.44 --> 01:06:50.48
I was thinking he was talking the power of suggestions.

1137
01:06:50.48 --> 01:06:52.44
Hey, Jocca, what do you think we should do here?

1138
01:06:52.44 --> 01:06:55.08
Here's the power of suggestion.

1139
01:06:55.08 --> 01:06:57.36
Hey, Dave, what do you suggest?

1140
01:06:57.36 --> 01:06:58.52
Yes.

1141
01:06:58.52 --> 01:07:01.12
Because I'm going to listen to it.

1142
01:07:01.12 --> 01:07:03.20
And we're probably going to do it.

1143
01:07:03.20 --> 01:07:07.40
I mean, unless it's just a travesty of a plan, we're going to do it.

1144
01:07:07.40 --> 01:07:13.72
So definitely some things to think about in there.

1145
01:07:13.72 --> 01:07:17.40
And as I look at this, look, guess what?

1146
01:07:17.40 --> 01:07:18.40
What's that saying?

1147
01:07:18.40 --> 01:07:20.16
We stand on the shoulders of giants.

1148
01:07:20.16 --> 01:07:21.72
This guy had to do his whole military.

1149
01:07:21.72 --> 01:07:22.88
We get to lead.

1150
01:07:22.88 --> 01:07:24.72
We get to take what he puts out.

1151
01:07:24.72 --> 01:07:28.36
This power of suggestion, which hack worth then took even further.

1152
01:07:28.36 --> 01:07:32.92
And now we got to take that and go even deeper.

1153
01:07:32.92 --> 01:07:37.36
Not even deeper, but further we got to expand that idea of decentralized command.

1154
01:07:37.36 --> 01:07:41.20
And of listening to what people have to say.

1155
01:07:41.20 --> 01:07:46.04
And the fact that hack worth freaking loved his draftes because his draftes would call

1156
01:07:46.04 --> 01:07:47.04
bullshit on him.

1157
01:07:47.04 --> 01:07:49.80
He says that in the book.

1158
01:07:49.80 --> 01:07:53.36
My draftes, they would call bullshit if they didn't agree with something.

1159
01:07:53.36 --> 01:07:54.76
So I loved them for it.

1160
01:07:54.76 --> 01:07:55.76
Not I hated them for it.

1161
01:07:55.76 --> 01:07:57.44
Not shut up and do what I told you to do.

1162
01:07:57.44 --> 01:07:59.60
Thank you.

1163
01:07:59.60 --> 01:08:03.000
Thank you for your suggestion that my idea is stupid.

1164
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
What do you suggest?

1165
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.68
He continues to kind of dismantle some of these earlier statements.

1166
01:08:10.68 --> 01:08:12.52
This section is called followership.

1167
01:08:12.52 --> 01:08:17.56
I want to get from there now to another subject and I'll end up and then I'll end up

1168
01:08:17.56 --> 01:08:18.96
my presentation.

1169
01:08:18.96 --> 01:08:22.36
That is the topic that fits right along with leadership.

1170
01:08:22.36 --> 01:08:24.60
What I call followership.

1171
01:08:24.60 --> 01:08:29.08
Everybody is a leader or a commander of any echelon is also a follower.

1172
01:08:29.08 --> 01:08:32.84
You're never, you never get in the hierarchy of the army to a point where you're not

1173
01:08:32.84 --> 01:08:34.20
a follower.

1174
01:08:34.20 --> 01:08:37.80
The chief of staff of army is a follower.

1175
01:08:37.80 --> 01:08:42.20
He follows the desires of the directors of the president, secretary of the army, secretary

1176
01:08:42.20 --> 01:08:44.88
defense, the joint chiefs of staff and so forth.

1177
01:08:44.88 --> 01:08:49.76
Even the president of the United States is a follower in that he follows public opinion.

1178
01:08:49.76 --> 01:08:54.88
What you are today, each one of you is the result of 35 to 40 years of following where

1179
01:08:54.88 --> 01:09:00.48
by you have taken into your makeup ideas, instruction, and concepts and through a process

1180
01:09:00.48 --> 01:09:04.64
of discernment, acceptance and elimination, you have stored away in your makeup certain

1181
01:09:04.64 --> 01:09:08.64
characteristics, ideas and procedures that end you have discarded others.

1182
01:09:08.64 --> 01:09:13.92
In that process of sifting through the good from the poor or what you consider the good

1183
01:09:13.92 --> 01:09:19.84
from the poor, you have created as of today your present makeup and character, which is

1184
01:09:19.84 --> 01:09:23.44
you as an individual.

1185
01:09:23.44 --> 01:09:29.60
If you have attained good characteristics and a storm of good ideas, learning and concepts

1186
01:09:29.60 --> 01:09:33.68
that you can use effectively in the future, you have been a good follower.

1187
01:09:33.68 --> 01:09:37.20
If you haven't, you'll not be a good leader nor a good commander.

1188
01:09:37.20 --> 01:09:43.40
It follows from that that you must through this process of discernment and storing away,

1189
01:09:43.40 --> 01:09:50.68
create in yourself a balanced man whereby you can handle concurrently all the different parts

1190
01:09:50.68 --> 01:09:52.96
of the job.

1191
01:09:52.96 --> 01:09:55.76
You don't concentrate on wanting to forget the other, such as maintenance.

1192
01:09:55.76 --> 01:09:58.64
You don't concentrate on marksmanship and forget something else.

1193
01:09:58.64 --> 01:10:04.40
The best organizations in the American Army are the organizations that are good or better

1194
01:10:04.40 --> 01:10:07.28
in everything.

1195
01:10:07.28 --> 01:10:09.80
They may not make any headlines.

1196
01:10:09.80 --> 01:10:15.92
They may not be superior in any one thing, but they are our best organizations.

1197
01:10:15.92 --> 01:10:19.64
These are the type of organizations that we want to develop in the Army.

1198
01:10:19.64 --> 01:10:26.000
I've tried to, so that idea of making headlines is a great point.

1199
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.72
This idea here reminds me of the gray man, they used to say going through buds, they

1200
01:10:29.72 --> 01:10:32.76
would say if you were the gray man, like if you don't want to be the number one swimmer.

1201
01:10:32.76 --> 01:10:39.12
Because in people who be watching you, you want to kind of like fit in.

1202
01:10:39.12 --> 01:10:43.28
I have tried to lead your thinking through the transition from leadership to commander

1203
01:10:43.28 --> 01:10:48.44
ship and general ship and to point out to you where in follow-up ship is very important

1204
01:10:48.44 --> 01:10:53.68
in this process of your development.

1205
01:10:53.68 --> 01:10:56.80
This next section is progressing up the pyramid of life.

1206
01:10:56.80 --> 01:11:00.80
So all of a sudden this just turns into like a life gig.

1207
01:11:00.80 --> 01:11:07.24
And when I was saying that the end of this section that we're going to cover gets, gets

1208
01:11:07.24 --> 01:11:10.16
really important, this is sort of where I'm starting.

1209
01:11:10.16 --> 01:11:14.12
It has been truthfully said that at the end when one looks back on his life, he should

1210
01:11:14.12 --> 01:11:18.000
measure his success by the number of wrongs up the ladder of life he has climbed since

1211
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.48
he started and not by the particular wrong on which he has finished.

1212
01:11:22.48 --> 01:11:31.72
The basic concept of our government under the Constitution is that all men are created equal.

1213
01:11:31.72 --> 01:11:33.36
All men are created equal.

1214
01:11:33.36 --> 01:11:41.12
This means not that all men are created equal for they are far from it.

1215
01:11:41.12 --> 01:11:48.96
It only means that all men should have equal opportunities and rights under our laws.

1216
01:11:48.96 --> 01:11:54.64
This concept is a great step in the progress of man.

1217
01:11:54.64 --> 01:12:00.96
When any group of men such as army officers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, scientists, clerks

1218
01:12:00.96 --> 01:12:07.36
or accountants start out in any corporation or any other organization they fit into a pyramid,

1219
01:12:07.36 --> 01:12:11.56
which is brought at the base but becomes smaller and smaller as they approach its peak,

1220
01:12:11.56 --> 01:12:18.64
assuming that those people in each category start with approximately equal backgrounds.

1221
01:12:18.64 --> 01:12:24.40
There is a selection process which starts as soon as they rise in the pyramid of life,

1222
01:12:24.40 --> 01:12:26.84
as soon as they tend to rise in the pyramid of life.

1223
01:12:26.84 --> 01:12:33.20
We're talking about this hierarchy, which obviously this might bring some thoughts of Jordan

1224
01:12:33.20 --> 01:12:40.80
Peterson and hierarchy of competence and that's kind of what we're talking about here.

1225
01:12:40.80 --> 01:12:44.92
Assuming that, and by the way, he's making, he says, assuming that people start in the

1226
01:12:44.92 --> 01:12:46.52
same approximate backgrounds.

1227
01:12:46.52 --> 01:12:48.52
That's a big freaking assumption.

1228
01:12:48.52 --> 01:12:51.04
But don't worry, he's going to get back on that.

1229
01:12:51.04 --> 01:12:52.64
But that's a huge assumption.

1230
01:12:52.64 --> 01:13:01.16
It's probably an assumption that they didn't recognize as much back in 1950.

1231
01:13:01.16 --> 01:13:05.88
Also assuming that the selection of those who rise in the pyramid of life is based upon

1232
01:13:05.88 --> 01:13:10.76
ability, experience, and the need for special capabilities and leadership, how does one

1233
01:13:10.76 --> 01:13:16.84
prepare himself for being chosen to advance in competition with his associates and colleagues?

1234
01:13:16.84 --> 01:13:19.32
So he's talking about how do you go up that pyramid?

1235
01:13:19.32 --> 01:13:26.36
How do you ascend the dominance hierarchy?

1236
01:13:26.36 --> 01:13:32.72
Everybody who is a leader, director, or commander at any echelon of an organization is also

1237
01:13:32.72 --> 01:13:34.52
a follower.

1238
01:13:34.52 --> 01:13:36.72
He never gets to a point where he is not.

1239
01:13:36.72 --> 01:13:38.36
And he goes to he repeats himself here.

1240
01:13:38.36 --> 01:13:39.96
The Chief of Staff of the Army is a follower.

1241
01:13:39.96 --> 01:13:43.68
He follows the desires of the director of the president, the secretary of the Army, even

1242
01:13:43.68 --> 01:13:46.80
the president is the United States of the United States of the following that he follows

1243
01:13:46.80 --> 01:13:48.92
public opinion.

1244
01:13:48.92 --> 01:13:53.36
What each one of us is today is the result of years of following.

1245
01:13:53.36 --> 01:13:58.48
whereby we have taken into our make-up knowledge, ideas, instruction, and concepts.

1246
01:13:58.48 --> 01:14:02.52
Through a process of discernment, acceptance, and elimination, we have stored away in our

1247
01:14:02.52 --> 01:14:08.52
personal ability, certain characteristics, ideas, and procedures, and we have discarded others

1248
01:14:08.52 --> 01:14:09.52
as nothing worthy.

1249
01:14:09.52 --> 01:14:11.64
So he repeats that section right there.

1250
01:14:11.64 --> 01:14:14.84
He's making it, he's trying to re-emphasize that point.

1251
01:14:14.84 --> 01:14:19.24
And the process of sifting the good from the poor, or what we consider the good from

1252
01:14:19.24 --> 01:14:23.78
the poor, we have created as of today, our president make-up and a character which is

1253
01:14:23.78 --> 01:14:25.24
ours as individuals.

1254
01:14:25.24 --> 01:14:30.68
If we have attained good, correct characteristics, and a store-room of good ideas, learning

1255
01:14:30.68 --> 01:14:35.96
techniques and concepts that we can use effectively in the future, we have been good followers.

1256
01:14:35.96 --> 01:14:42.36
And it was nice to compare this to you know, you and I covered the Marine Corps document

1257
01:14:42.36 --> 01:14:45.68
learning.

1258
01:14:45.68 --> 01:14:50.92
And really when he's talking about following, what he's really talking about is learning.

1259
01:14:50.92 --> 01:14:54.92
Hey, just said, you got to, if you can take that and apply it, then you've been a good

1260
01:14:54.92 --> 01:14:55.92
follower.

1261
01:14:55.92 --> 01:14:57.48
Yeah, yeah.

1262
01:14:57.48 --> 01:15:03.000
We have a good basis for being successful leaders and in all probability we will advance.

1263
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.20
A good follower is able to react quickly and effectively to an emergency or a crisis

1264
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:13.72
hence he has the potential to become a fine military commander.

1265
01:15:13.72 --> 01:15:18.96
This process must be continuous during our active careers if we are to continue to grow

1266
01:15:18.96 --> 01:15:19.96
in judgment and balance.

1267
01:15:19.96 --> 01:15:23.44
Again, this is the mind's me that Marine Corps like you are learning.

1268
01:15:23.44 --> 01:15:24.64
That's what we're doing.

1269
01:15:24.64 --> 01:15:30.64
And I have a note here that says that this section that I'm about to read is the own

1270
01:15:30.64 --> 01:15:34.88
of his whole thing starts to come together for me.

1271
01:15:34.88 --> 01:15:37.92
Some call this experience, but it is more than that.

1272
01:15:37.92 --> 01:15:46.16
It is the constant and critically sound evaluation of experience that causes us to progress

1273
01:15:46.16 --> 01:15:49.44
in stature and move up the pyramid of life.

1274
01:15:49.44 --> 01:15:53.12
So it's not just about experience.

1275
01:15:53.12 --> 01:15:57.32
Experience by itself barely even helps you.

1276
01:15:57.32 --> 01:16:01.52
What you have to do is you have to take that experience and you have to constant and

1277
01:16:01.52 --> 01:16:06.80
critically evaluate it.

1278
01:16:06.80 --> 01:16:08.92
And that's what will make you progress.

1279
01:16:08.92 --> 01:16:14.40
So you can just go through life and experience all kinds of crazy things and leadership

1280
01:16:14.40 --> 01:16:15.40
challenges.

1281
01:16:15.40 --> 01:16:20.56
But if you never critically assess what you did, what you learned, how you performed, you

1282
01:16:20.56 --> 01:16:23.84
were not talking during the break.

1283
01:16:23.84 --> 01:16:29.000
You said something like, I can't believe that I just didn't get issued this book as a second

1284
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
lieutenant when I graduated from the basic school or whatever.

1285
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.24
And we had a quick conversation about the fact that it's one thing to pick up a book and

1286
01:16:41.24 --> 01:16:42.88
read it.

1287
01:16:42.88 --> 01:16:53.80
It's another thing to have a actual conversation and have context and have thoughts around

1288
01:16:53.80 --> 01:16:54.80
the book.

1289
01:16:54.80 --> 01:16:57.68
And I think that's probably one of the reasons why people listen to the podcast is because

1290
01:16:57.68 --> 01:16:59.88
not because I'm sitting here doing an audio book.

1291
01:16:59.88 --> 01:17:00.88
Right?

1292
01:17:00.88 --> 01:17:04.20
I mean, this isn't an audio book of this book.

1293
01:17:04.20 --> 01:17:09.88
This is my thoughts, your thoughts and general Clarks thoughts.

1294
01:17:09.88 --> 01:17:10.88
And sometimes we're right.

1295
01:17:10.88 --> 01:17:13.32
Sometimes we're wrong, sometimes we agree, sometimes we disagree.

1296
01:17:13.32 --> 01:17:18.36
But what we are doing when we do that is we're constantly critically evaluating the experience

1297
01:17:18.36 --> 01:17:19.36
that he had.

1298
01:17:19.36 --> 01:17:23.76
And then we're constantly, we just, you and I just did a freaking 30 minute evaluation

1299
01:17:23.76 --> 01:17:26.72
of the fact that we inspected our admins are not.

1300
01:17:26.72 --> 01:17:31.20
And lessons were learned.

1301
01:17:31.20 --> 01:17:34.12
So that's what we're doing.

1302
01:17:34.12 --> 01:17:36.64
This idea of learning all the time.

1303
01:17:36.64 --> 01:17:41.04
And the more important man, the idea of what look we talk about all the time at echelon

1304
01:17:41.04 --> 01:17:43.04
front, you got to do a debrief.

1305
01:17:43.04 --> 01:17:44.04
You got to do a debrief.

1306
01:17:44.04 --> 01:17:45.84
You have to do a debrief and you get done with the operation.

1307
01:17:45.84 --> 01:17:46.84
When are lose, you got to do a debrief?

1308
01:17:46.84 --> 01:17:51.44
That's what you have to do.

1309
01:17:51.44 --> 01:17:56.32
Then you got to enter early in life as some members of society fall.

1310
01:17:56.32 --> 01:17:59.48
And this is where we just started getting into this broad conversation.

1311
01:17:59.48 --> 01:18:03.04
And this is sort of the last section here.

1312
01:18:03.04 --> 01:18:09.96
Early in life, some members of society fall into limited categories due to handicaps of

1313
01:18:09.96 --> 01:18:15.36
opportunities, health and physical and mental ability.

1314
01:18:15.36 --> 01:18:22.24
These people start life with ceilings over them that few are able to pierce.

1315
01:18:22.24 --> 01:18:26.44
So there's certain situations that you can be born into that are going to be challenging

1316
01:18:26.44 --> 01:18:33.48
and they're really hard to get through.

1317
01:18:33.48 --> 01:18:36.08
And he gets that.

1318
01:18:36.08 --> 01:18:43.48
And then he goes on to say, but how about those whose opportunities, education and

1319
01:18:43.48 --> 01:18:50.96
apparent ability, seem to start off on common equal footing as they begin to move up the

1320
01:18:50.96 --> 01:18:54.76
pyramid of life?

1321
01:18:54.76 --> 01:19:00.64
Each one eventually reaches his own peak and levels off at various distances from the

1322
01:19:00.64 --> 01:19:03.88
top.

1323
01:19:03.88 --> 01:19:12.32
Very few have an apparent ceiling over them at the start, but they develop ceilings at

1324
01:19:12.32 --> 01:19:16.56
various levels as they go along.

1325
01:19:16.56 --> 01:19:18.88
So now we're talking about this pyramid.

1326
01:19:18.88 --> 01:19:21.44
We got this pyramid that we're trying to climb up.

1327
01:19:21.44 --> 01:19:25.76
And some people are, they have a legitimate ceiling in life.

1328
01:19:25.76 --> 01:19:32.28
Whatever they were born, they've got some situation that is a ceiling that they're

1329
01:19:32.28 --> 01:19:34.64
going to reach.

1330
01:19:34.64 --> 01:19:36.08
And it can be very hard to break through that.

1331
01:19:36.08 --> 01:19:41.12
But now we're talking about, hey, look, now you've got people that there's no real ceiling.

1332
01:19:41.12 --> 01:19:44.96
He's on equal footing.

1333
01:19:44.96 --> 01:19:48.48
And then he says, each one eventually reaches his own peak and levels off at various

1334
01:19:48.48 --> 01:19:51.000
distances from the top.

1335
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.72
Very few have an apparent ceiling over them at the start, but they develop ceilings at

1336
01:19:56.72 --> 01:19:58.80
various levels as they go along.

1337
01:19:58.80 --> 01:20:04.96
What causes this leveling off process on the part of an individual?

1338
01:20:04.96 --> 01:20:10.24
What factors tend to cause this ceiling to form over him?

1339
01:20:10.24 --> 01:20:12.28
And then he's got this list.

1340
01:20:12.28 --> 01:20:19.72
He's got this list of factors that cause you to reach your limitation, that cause people

1341
01:20:19.72 --> 01:20:22.20
to reach their limitations.

1342
01:20:22.20 --> 01:20:24.76
Here they are.

1343
01:20:24.76 --> 01:20:28.64
Wrong decisions.

1344
01:20:28.64 --> 01:20:32.92
Wasted opportunities.

1345
01:20:32.92 --> 01:20:44.88
The duration of attitude and enthusiasm, excesses lack of self-control, lack of honesty

1346
01:20:44.88 --> 01:21:01.80
of purpose, tendency toward lowered standards, poor ethics, loss of self-respect, loss

1347
01:21:01.80 --> 01:21:14.84
of motivation and ambition, lack of ability to express himself orally or in writing, poor associations,

1348
01:21:14.84 --> 01:21:25.60
wrong scale of values, failure in carrying out responsibility, lack of loyalty, upper down

1349
01:21:25.60 --> 01:21:34.60
unfortunate family situations, deterioration of physical condition, bad habits, poor financial

1350
01:21:34.60 --> 01:21:42.76
management, disregard of rules, procrastination, failure to keep up with progress in his

1351
01:21:42.76 --> 01:21:46.64
field.

1352
01:21:46.64 --> 01:21:51.56
So what's amazing about that list?

1353
01:21:51.56 --> 01:21:52.56
Let's see.

1354
01:21:52.56 --> 01:21:54.20
I don't know how many there are.

1355
01:21:54.20 --> 01:21:59.04
There's maybe one lack of ability to express himself orally in writing.

1356
01:21:59.04 --> 01:22:00.88
So that is, can you get better at that?

1357
01:22:00.88 --> 01:22:01.88
Yes, you can.

1358
01:22:01.88 --> 01:22:04.60
But there are some people that don't have the same capability.

1359
01:22:04.60 --> 01:22:05.88
Look, wrong decisions.

1360
01:22:05.88 --> 01:22:07.48
Who's that on?

1361
01:22:07.48 --> 01:22:08.48
You.

1362
01:22:08.48 --> 01:22:09.48
Wasted opportunities.

1363
01:22:09.48 --> 01:22:11.48
Detiration of attitude and enthusiasm.

1364
01:22:11.48 --> 01:22:12.48
You.

1365
01:22:12.48 --> 01:22:14.12
Excesses and lack of self-control.

1366
01:22:14.12 --> 01:22:15.12
You.

1367
01:22:15.12 --> 01:22:16.36
Lack of honesty and lack of purpose.

1368
01:22:16.36 --> 01:22:17.36
You.

1369
01:22:17.36 --> 01:22:19.12
Tendency toward lowered standards.

1370
01:22:19.12 --> 01:22:20.12
You.

1371
01:22:20.12 --> 01:22:21.12
Poor ethics.

1372
01:22:21.12 --> 01:22:22.12
You.

1373
01:22:22.12 --> 01:22:24.12
Loss of motivation and ambition.

1374
01:22:24.12 --> 01:22:26.96
Lack of ability to express himself orally in writing.

1375
01:22:26.96 --> 01:22:30.20
Okay, we can improve it, but you may have a limited there.

1376
01:22:30.20 --> 01:22:32.20
Poor associations.

1377
01:22:32.20 --> 01:22:33.20
You.

1378
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:34.72
Wrong scale of values.

1379
01:22:34.72 --> 01:22:35.72
You.

1380
01:22:35.72 --> 01:22:37.56
Failure in carrying out responsibility.

1381
01:22:37.56 --> 01:22:38.56
You.

1382
01:22:38.56 --> 01:22:40.20
Lack of loyalty up or down.

1383
01:22:40.20 --> 01:22:41.36
You.

1384
01:22:41.36 --> 01:22:43.64
Unfortunately, family situations.

1385
01:22:43.64 --> 01:22:47.08
That's something we don't always have control over.

1386
01:22:47.08 --> 01:22:49.32
Detiration of physical condition.

1387
01:22:49.32 --> 01:22:51.68
That's something that we don't always have control over.

1388
01:22:51.68 --> 01:22:55.64
It's something that we also do have control over, depending on what that deterioration is being

1389
01:22:55.64 --> 01:22:56.64
caused by.

1390
01:22:56.64 --> 01:23:01.56
If you have some kind of a disease that you can't control, look, that's one of those things.

1391
01:23:01.56 --> 01:23:04.52
But oftentimes, there's things that we can do to make sure we maintain our physical

1392
01:23:04.52 --> 01:23:07.52
condition.

1393
01:23:07.52 --> 01:23:08.52
Bad habits.

1394
01:23:08.52 --> 01:23:10.52
That's you.

1395
01:23:10.52 --> 01:23:11.92
Poor financial management.

1396
01:23:11.92 --> 01:23:13.52
That's you.

1397
01:23:13.52 --> 01:23:14.52
This regard to the rules.

1398
01:23:14.52 --> 01:23:16.000
That's you.

1399
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:24.92
Your procrastination, that's you, failure to keep up with progress in his field, that is you.

1400
01:23:24.92 --> 01:23:33.12
So that is, as a lot of stuff, too, that we can take ownership of.

1401
01:23:33.12 --> 01:23:39.96
Now this whole section closes out with this following statement here.

1402
01:23:39.96 --> 01:23:42.36
Poor, poor fellowship.

1403
01:23:42.36 --> 01:23:45.92
And I think that's supposed to say, follow our ship.

1404
01:23:45.92 --> 01:23:53.40
The follow our ship is a great contributor to ceiling formation.

1405
01:23:53.40 --> 01:23:58.32
And again, the way he's using follow our ship to me is he's talking about, you know,

1406
01:23:58.32 --> 01:24:03.40
the ability to learn, the ability to take ownership of what's happening.

1407
01:24:03.40 --> 01:24:07.52
Once a ceiling is formed or start to form, form is difficult to break through, a few

1408
01:24:07.52 --> 01:24:10.32
do break through despite handicaps.

1409
01:24:10.32 --> 01:24:17.96
However, there are those who would try to dispel these ceilings by social laws and values,

1410
01:24:17.96 --> 01:24:20.80
meaning they want to blame other people.

1411
01:24:20.80 --> 01:24:26.000
To be sure, they are partially successful on the lower reaches of the pyramid of life,

1412
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.96
but not as they reach the apex of the pyramid.

1413
01:24:28.96 --> 01:24:34.76
They only warp the shape of the pyramid at certain levels.

1414
01:24:34.76 --> 01:24:39.28
The Bible says that many are called, but few are chosen.

1415
01:24:39.28 --> 01:24:52.16
It is ever thus as we tried to progress up the pyramid or ladder of life.

1416
01:24:52.16 --> 01:24:53.16
Yeah.

1417
01:24:53.16 --> 01:25:03.28
So with that, probably a good place to stop this one, that's just such an important way

1418
01:25:03.28 --> 01:25:05.04
to look at things.

1419
01:25:05.04 --> 01:25:11.08
And we always talk about extreme ownership from a leadership perspective and leading

1420
01:25:11.08 --> 01:25:17.88
organizations and leading teams, but extreme ownership is about you, it's about your life,

1421
01:25:17.88 --> 01:25:20.36
it's about what you're doing.

1422
01:25:20.36 --> 01:25:25.48
And we have a lot more ownership over what we do and where we end up and where we end

1423
01:25:25.48 --> 01:25:35.000
up in this ladder, in this pyramid, then some people would have you believe.

1424
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.64
That's almost sort of seems like a haphazard list, like almost they're not related

1425
01:25:41.64 --> 01:25:44.000
to those things he was running through.

1426
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.60
And then the common thread is he basically just captured almost all those things are things

1427
01:25:50.60 --> 01:25:58.64
that we impose upon ourselves, which in some sense is like it's kind of crazy because

1428
01:25:58.64 --> 01:26:03.60
as I dissect what he's saying and like, well, how much control do I have over that?

1429
01:26:03.60 --> 01:26:07.36
And for almost all of them, it's 100%.

1430
01:26:07.36 --> 01:26:12.88
Not like, hey, there are components and I think you actually did a good job because, yeah,

1431
01:26:12.88 --> 01:26:17.04
you know what, life happens and you say this on the podcast, other times life happens.

1432
01:26:17.04 --> 01:26:20.88
And sometimes those things in life that happen most certainly limit what we can do.

1433
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:24.56
It's the fact that those things do happen.

1434
01:26:24.56 --> 01:26:32.72
And even inside of the thread of all those is when he said, wasted opportunities.

1435
01:26:32.72 --> 01:26:36.88
I mean, you want to talk about someone who's taken stock of his life that's actually

1436
01:26:36.88 --> 01:26:39.44
kind of achieved inside this pyramid that he's talking about.

1437
01:26:39.44 --> 01:26:42.80
He's at the top of this pyramid.

1438
01:26:42.80 --> 01:26:49.04
Man, that is a humbling series of things that he's calculated really about himself.

1439
01:26:49.04 --> 01:26:51.32
Number one, wrong decision.

1440
01:26:51.32 --> 01:26:54.16
Number two, waste opportunities.

1441
01:26:54.16 --> 01:27:01.52
Yeah, I mean, there's some startling things inside there and properly, probably for

1442
01:27:01.52 --> 01:27:03.68
me what he did.

1443
01:27:03.68 --> 01:27:08.08
Yes, again, I struggled this section a lot more than the last one because there's part of like,

1444
01:27:08.08 --> 01:27:10.000
where is he going when this stuff?

1445
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.28
Why is he even saying that?

1446
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.16
And when he kind of brings a full back, the thing that he did is this is a guy that

1447
01:27:16.16 --> 01:27:22.64
contemplated the things that he has done and why he did them and dissected the mistakes that

1448
01:27:22.64 --> 01:27:24.08
he's made.

1449
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:29.52
I mean, if there's a mistake that I made throughout my career was not spending enough time

1450
01:27:29.52 --> 01:27:32.64
dissecting why I did the things that I did.

1451
01:27:34.08 --> 01:27:42.56
And that is a, that is a self-imposed limitation that if you don't think about why the

1452
01:27:42.56 --> 01:27:46.16
meaning, if you don't learn from the things that you did and why you did them,

1453
01:27:46.16 --> 01:27:48.24
that is a self-imposed limitation.

1454
01:27:48.88 --> 01:27:52.80
And God, that list is, that is a humbling list of things to think about.

1455
01:27:52.80 --> 01:27:55.68
Yeah, it's a, it's a heavy hitter.

1456
01:27:55.68 --> 01:27:57.92
Dude, it's a heavy hitter.

1457
01:27:57.92 --> 01:28:00.48
Wrong decisions. Number one.

1458
01:28:00.48 --> 01:28:05.20
But even then, like, there's, there's an ego thing of like, well, yeah, I mean, you know,

1459
01:28:05.20 --> 01:28:08.64
people make people make wrong. I mean, you don't have a decision is right?

1460
01:28:09.20 --> 01:28:10.48
Well, pull that back a little bit.

1461
01:28:11.76 --> 01:28:13.20
Who's that on?

1462
01:28:14.56 --> 01:28:18.08
The mistakes that you made. Who's fault is that?

1463
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:21.36
It's not not yours that I am at a bad call over here.

1464
01:28:21.36 --> 01:28:28.16
Um, so yeah, I mean, I was struggling at the beginning of each of those parts of like,

1465
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:31.20
where how is he going to pull this back? And it reminds me of something that you and

1466
01:28:31.20 --> 01:28:35.52
Lave reminded each other about was when we were talking to Tom Fife.

1467
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:38.72
And I'm sitting here listening to him and he says something and I'm like, man, that didn't

1468
01:28:38.72 --> 01:28:42.40
seem like you were, why did you say that, man? That's not what you're going to say.

1469
01:28:42.40 --> 01:28:50.40
And then he pulls that back full circle of like how clean he made that at the end when in the

1470
01:28:50.40 --> 01:28:52.64
beginning, I'm thinking, where are we going here?

1471
01:28:52.64 --> 01:28:59.04
Yeah, that was like a four minute evolution where I was we were, we were, I don't know,

1472
01:28:59.04 --> 01:29:03.44
probably a third of the way into a really well, it's going to be a long podcast and I think,

1473
01:29:03.44 --> 01:29:09.92
oh, well, I guess his leadership principles don't really mess up with mine. And that's real

1474
01:29:09.92 --> 01:29:12.96
bummer because he's saying, hey, you tell people what to do and they just do it because they've

1475
01:29:12.96 --> 01:29:16.80
been trained that way. And that's okay, you know, they just, they're just so beating because they're

1476
01:29:16.80 --> 01:29:23.36
in the army and for three minutes, I sat there and thought, dang, I guess this isn't. And then

1477
01:29:23.36 --> 01:29:28.32
after three minutes he goes, but these guys would never do what you told him to do just because

1478
01:29:28.32 --> 01:29:32.48
you told him to do it. Yeah, you they need to understand why they were telling us like, yes, totally.

1479
01:29:32.48 --> 01:29:37.12
Thankfully, thankfully. And I think that's the kind of the transition that you see,

1480
01:29:38.32 --> 01:29:41.04
you know, someone like General Clark making towards the end of his careers,

1481
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:44.64
look, hey, this is General ship, you want to lead by suggest new one after barc orders of people.

1482
01:29:44.64 --> 01:29:47.68
If they're not taking initiative, making things happen, you're doing something wrong.

1483
01:29:47.68 --> 01:29:54.16
That applies. I'm telling you that applies to a platoon, it applies to a squad, it applies to a

1484
01:29:54.16 --> 01:30:01.04
business, it applies to a big business and it applies to a nine person business. It's all the same.

1485
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:10.96
And how, how comforting is it? How, how good is it to think, oh, I have control over all these things.

1486
01:30:10.96 --> 01:30:19.12
That is actually completely awesome. All these problems in my life. All these things that they're

1487
01:30:19.12 --> 01:30:23.92
all self-imposed, which means I actually have control over all of them. Yeah, I don't know, once again,

1488
01:30:23.92 --> 01:30:28.48
that's the cool premise of extreme ownership. And it's cool when you apply it to your organization.

1489
01:30:28.48 --> 01:30:33.04
Could you say, hey, this is, this is on me. I'm going to make these changes for our company,

1490
01:30:33.04 --> 01:30:39.60
for our team, so we do better. But man, the way it hits you is a human. When you look at all these

1491
01:30:39.60 --> 01:30:44.64
problems that you have and you go, oh, this problem is assailing me. This problem is attacking me.

1492
01:30:44.64 --> 01:30:51.28
This problem is going to destroy me. You say, oh, wait, you know what? I'm going to take ownership

1493
01:30:51.28 --> 01:30:55.60
of those problems. I'm going to get those things sorted out. And look, are there some outliers? Sure.

1494
01:30:55.60 --> 01:31:00.48
There are. There are. Can you get, can you get a horrible disease? Can things that are

1495
01:31:00.48 --> 01:31:08.08
completely beyond your control hit you? Yes, they can. Of course, of course. And, and, you know,

1496
01:31:08.08 --> 01:31:12.96
those, then it turns into, okay, how are you going to respond to those things that are out beyond your control?

1497
01:31:14.32 --> 01:31:25.52
But so many things that we face are just straight on us, wrong decisions,

1498
01:31:25.52 --> 01:31:34.64
waste an opportunity, lack of self respect, very seldom does the ceiling come from others.

1499
01:31:34.64 --> 01:31:41.12
Very seldom does the ceiling come from other most of the time. The vast majority of the time,

1500
01:31:41.12 --> 01:31:48.88
the limitations in our life are exactly that they are our limitations that we imposed on ourselves.

1501
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.96
So I think that's a good connection that he makes, but even though this book is about leading others,

1502
01:31:56.96 --> 01:32:06.16
we cannot lead others if we can't lead ourselves. And if we can't do the right things ourselves,

1503
01:32:07.36 --> 01:32:11.12
then we have no one else to blame. But us.

1504
01:32:14.96 --> 01:32:20.08
All right, good place, good place to stop for now. And I think speaking of

1505
01:32:20.08 --> 01:32:27.92
bad habits, right, we can have some bad habits. Well, we also want to have some good habits.

1506
01:32:27.92 --> 01:32:33.36
We want to speak in a lack of self control. We want to have self control. Speaking of bad decisions,

1507
01:32:33.36 --> 01:32:38.72
we want to make good decisions. Let's think of some ways to get us on the right path for all these things.

1508
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:44.48
We had Jaco Fiel, which is a bunch of supplements, joint warfare,

1509
01:32:44.48 --> 01:32:54.64
krill oil, discipline, discipline, go, vitamin D, Cold War, Mulk, which is protein disguised as

1510
01:32:54.64 --> 01:33:00.000
dessert, a bunch of awesome things for you to put in your body so your performance will improve.

1511
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.20
You'll become a better human being. Those are good decisions to make.

1512
01:33:05.44 --> 01:33:11.12
Jaco, wait, T. All the stuff that we make is available at originmain.com. It's available at the

1513
01:33:11.12 --> 01:33:18.72
Vitamin Shop. It's available at WaWa. We also make a bunch of Jiu Jitsu gear.

1514
01:33:20.08 --> 01:33:21.68
Jiu Jitsu gear made in America.

1515
01:33:24.24 --> 01:33:30.64
G's rash cards go to go to originmain.com if you want to get a G or a rash card. And by the way,

1516
01:33:30.64 --> 01:33:35.60
you can't go out to the store in your G, even though you might want to. You can't, you got to wear

1517
01:33:35.60 --> 01:33:43.84
jeans. Go and check out the clothes we have, the jeans, the boots. There are shorts coming online.

1518

1519
01:33:49.12 --> 01:33:55.60
okay, all that stuff is available. Originmain.com, main America, main America by American Hands. Go

1563

heuristic herrings or maybe you just want some more of Dave's vehement vocals. Then you can find

1565
01:38:25.04 --> 01:38:30.16
us on the in-a-web's on Twitter, on Instagram, which echo likes to call the gram.

Anon Facebook. Dave is at David R. Burke, and I am at

1567
01:38:36.24 --> 01:38:41.68
Jaco Willink and thanks. Once again to General Bruce Clark and to Colonel David Hackworth

1568
01:38:41.68 --> 01:38:47.68
for your service to America and for continuing to take care of the troops through the lessons

1569
01:38:47.68 --> 01:38:52.08
you passed on. Thanks to the military personnel out there right now, hold the line.

1570
01:38:53.36 --> 01:38:57.52
Thank you for doing what you do every day to keep us safe and to the police and law enforcement

1571
01:38:57.52 --> 01:39:02.08
firefighters and paramedics and EMT's dispatchers correctional officers board patrol secret

1572
01:39:02.08 --> 01:39:06.08
service and all the other first responders. Thank you for holding the line here at home

1573
01:39:06.08 --> 01:39:11.92
and to everyone else out there. Remember these lessons from General Clark. Remember that the

1574
01:39:11.92 --> 01:39:19.52
ceiling you can't break through. Remember that there's a pretty good chance that you built it.

1575
01:39:21.28 --> 01:39:24.64
You made the wrong decisions wasted opportunities to tear your

1576
01:39:24.64 --> 01:39:31.44
nation of attitude lowering standards, poor ethics, poor associations, procrastination,

1577
01:39:31.44 --> 01:39:38.16
and bad habits that list goes on and on and on and the list is on you. The list is on me.

1578
01:39:41.60 --> 01:39:47.12
We control so much of our fate. We control so much of our destiny.

1579
01:39:49.36 --> 01:39:52.80
There may be those little fractions of things that we don't truly control.

1580
01:39:53.36 --> 01:39:59.04
Maybe that's what causes us to just give up on the rest. But I'm telling you don't do that.

1581
01:39:59.04 --> 01:40:05.76
Don't give up on it, own it, own it, all and break through that ceiling.

1582
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.76
And become what you want to become and become who you are supposed to become and you do that

1583
01:40:17.44 --> 01:40:22.72
by going out there every day and getting after it.

1584
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:30.24
So until next time, this is Dave and Joko out.
